Based on the results of engine tests,\nan alternative emission control system and modified control strategy were imple\xc2\xad\nmented and tested in the vehicle. With the same fuel economy and NO, emissions\nas the stock vehicle, the modified vehicle reduced HC and CO emissions by about\n20 percent. By removing the NO, emissions constraint, the modified vehicle\ndemonstrated about 12 percent better fuel economy than the stock vehicle.\n\n17. \t Key Words\n\nAutomobiles \t\nFuel Economy \t\nExhaust Emissions \t\n19. \t Security Clossif.

To prevent further deterioration of the air environment,\n\nespecially in urban areas, it seems likely that still more stringent controls\n\non automobile emissions will be required in the future. Recent experience with\n\nthe Arab oil embargo has dramatically shown the national need for developing\n\nalternative fuels and practicing energy conservation. These somewhat conflict\xc2\xad\ning needs have placed additional emphasis on the need for a thorough under\xc2\xad\nstanding of the interactions between automobile fuel economy and emission\n\ncontrol.\n\nThe primary objective of this effort was to generate experimental data\n\nto support an assessment of the relationship between automobile fuel economy\n\nand emission control systems. To provide a more completeunderstanding of\n\nthis interaction, tests at both the engine and vehicle levels were included.\n\nThe effort was concentrated on a detailed investigation of three emission con\xc2\xad\ntrol systems: cold start emissions devices, exhaust gas recirculation (EGR)\n\nsystems, and air injection reactor (AIR) systems. Based on literature informa\xc2\xad\ntion, analyses and experimental data, these emission reduction techniques were\n\nevaluated to establish the potential for improving the fuel economy/emissions\n\nof the stock vehicle. Using these evaluations, an alternative emission control\n\nsystem was implemented, tested, and compared with the stock system.\n\nWithin the limited resources of this effort, it was not possible to\n\nobtain results for more than one vehicle; however, detailed data on one vehicle\n\nwith a particular engine/emission control system does provide a foundation on\n\nwhich to make future projections of fuel economy.\n\nThe primary activities covered in this effort were as follows:\n\n(1)\n\nVehicle selection and preparation.\n\n\n(2)\n\nBaseline engine and vehicle tests.\n\n\n(3)\n\nEvaluation of cold-start emissions devices.\n\n\n(4)\n\nEvaluation of EGR system.\n\n\n(5)\n\nEvaluation of AIR system.\n\n\n(6)\n\nDevelopment and implementation of improved control strategies.\n\n\n(7)\n\nCompletion of modified vehicle tests.\n\n\n1\n\n\nSECTION II\n\nSTOCK VEHICLE\n\n\nSELECTION AND PREPARATION\n\nCare was exercised in selecting avehicle for this evaluation to insure\n\nthat the fuel economy and emissions results would be meaningful. \'The vehicle\n\nselected was a 1975 Plymouth Valiant with the 6-cylinder engine.\' In EPA\xc2\xad\n,certified tests this vehicle/engine combination gave a fuel economy in the\n\nFederal urban and highway driving cycles which was among thebest achieved in\n\nthe 3500 lb inertia weight class as shown in Figures 1 - 3. By selecting a\n\nvehicle from among the best fuel economy vehicles, any positive results\n\nachieved during the program become more meaningful. A vehicle in the 3500 it\n\ninertia weight class was chosen since lighter vehicles seem to be the trend\n\nof the future. The vehicle also came equipped in California with the emission\n\ncontrol system (exhaust catalyst, EGA, and AIR) which was necessary for this\n\nevaluation.\n\nPrior to the start of the break-in period, the vehicle was tuned to\n\nfactory specifications. The vehicle ran erratically and was returned to. the\n\ndealer for correction of the problem, which was identified as an EGR control\n\nproblem. Corrections were made; however, the same problem reappeared after\n\nless than 100 miles of driving. To avoid any further delays, the EGR system\n\nwas disconnected and the break-in of the vehicle was completed. The vehicle\n\nwas driven approximately 4000 road miles with the EGR system inoperative.\n\nUpon completion of the break-in period, the vehicle was returned to the dealer\n\n20 \t\n\nI\n\nI\n\n18\n\nR\nE\n\n16 \t\n\n0\n*A\n\nz\n14\n\nA\t\n\n12\n\nVEHICLE WEIGHT = 3500 lb\n0 \t = AMERICAN MOTORS\n= FORD MOTOR CO\n* \t = CHRYSLER CORP\nBASELINE VEHICLE\n\nI\n200\n250\n\n10 \t\n150\n\n0\n\nI\n300\n\nENGINE DISPLACEMENT, in.\n\n350\n\n3\n\nFigure 1. \tUrban Fuel Economy for 1975 California Vehicles - Ref. 1\n(Only vehicles with catalyst, EGR, and AIR are included.)\n2\n\n\n23\n\n\npAI\n\nI\t\n\n2423\n\n22 \t\n\n0\n\n\nA\n\n20U\n\n19\n\n-0.\n\n18\n17\n16\n\n-\n\n15\n\nVEHICLE WEIGHT = 3500 Ib\n= AMERICAN MOTORS\nA = FORD MOTOR CO\n0 = CHRYSLER CORP\nBASELINE VEHICLE\n\nI\nI \t\n300\n250\n200\n3\n\nENGINE DISPLACEMENT, in.\n\n14\n150 \t\n\nFigure 2.\n\nA.\n\n350\n\nHighway Fuel Economy for 1975 California Vehicles\n\n-\n\nRef. 1\n\n\n(Only vehicles with catalyst, EGR, and AIR are included.)\n\n\nI\n\n20\n19\'\n\n18\n\nA\n\n.0\n\n17 \t\n\n0\n\nA\n\nE\n\n-16\n\nU.\n\n15\n\n15\n\nA\n\no 14\nA"\nA\n\no\t\nu 13\n12\n11\n10\n150\n\nVEHICLE WEIGHT = 3500 Ib\nO = AMERICAN MOTORS\nA- FORD MOTOR CO\n* = CHRYSLER CORP\nBASELINE VEHICLE\nI\nI\n300\n\'250\n200\nn3\nENGINE DISPLACEMENT, i .\n\n350\n\n.Figure 3. \t Composite Fuel Economy for 1975 California Vehicles - Ref. 1\n(Only vehicles with catalyst, EGR, and AIR are included.)\n\n3\n\n\nfor another tune-up to factory specifications. Again the dealer attempted\n\nto correct the EGR control problem; however, the same problem reappeared before\n\nthe baseline vehicle tests could be run. The vehicle was then taken to the\n\nChrysler Emissions Laboratory in Santa Fe Springs, California for resolution\n\nof the EGR problem and another tune-up. This action corrected the EGR problem\n\nand permitted the start of baseline tests.\n\nGENERAL DESCRIPTION\n\nAs described in the previous section, a 1975 Plymouth Valiant with the\n\n6-cylinder engine was selected for evaluation. The baseline engine is a\n\n225 cubic inch displacement (CID) engine with the slant-6 design. Factory\n\nspecifications\'for this engine/vehicle are given in Table 1.\n\nThe stock ignition system is the standard breaker point type consisting\n\nof a coil, condenser, distributor, wiring, and spark plugs. The spark advance\n\ncharacteristic is determined by the 00 BTDC basic advance and the contributions\n\nof the centrifugal and vacuum advance mechanisms. The centrifugal and vacuum\n\nadvance characteristics were measured on a Sun distributor machine and are\n\ngiven in Figure 4.\n\nFactory-installed devices for emission control include a catalytic con\xc2\xad\nverter, an air injection reactor (AIR) pump, an exhaust gas recirculation (EGR)\n\nsystem, and a positive crankcase ventilation (PCV) system. The catalytic con\xc2\xad\nverter is used to oxidize the unburned hydrocarbons (HC) and carbon monoxide\n\n(CO) in the engine exhaust system. The AIR pump introduces excess air into the\n\nexhaust manifold to promote conversion of HC and CO in the catalytic converter.\n\nThe EGR system recirculates a portion of the exhaust gases to a region directly\n\n\nTable 1.\nVehicle\nEngine\nType\nBore\nStroke\nDisplacement\nCompression ratio\nAdvertised hp\nAdvertised torque\nCarburetor\nFuel pump\nSpark plugs\nFiring order\nEmissions devices \t\n\nTransmission \t\nGear ratios \t\n\nRear axle ratio \t\n\nStock Vehicle Specifications\n\n1975 Plymouth Valiant\n\nSlant-6 (6 cylinders)\n\nIn-line overhead valve\n\n3.40 in.\n\n4.125 in.\n\n225 cu in.\n\n8.40\n\n100 @ 3600 RPM\n\n170 ft-lb @ 1600 RPM\n\nHolley Model 1945 1-barrel carburetor\n\nCarter Model MS-4844S (diaphragm type)\n\nChampion BL13Y\n\n1-5-3-6-2-4\n\nAir injection reactor\n\nExhaust gas recirculation\n\nPositive crankcase ventilation\n\nCatalytic converter\n\nTorque Flite\n\nFirst - 2.45\n\nIntermediate - 1.45\n\nHigh - 1.00\n\n\n2.76\n\n4\n\n14 \n\n\nII \n\n\nI1 \n\n\n1\n\n\nvooa\n\nU 10\n\'41\n12\n\nZ8\n\n\n<6\n\n4\n2\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1000\n\nII\n200\n\n3000 4\n\nDISTRIBUTOR RPM\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\nMANIFOLD VACUUM,\n\n14\n\n16\n\n18\n\nin. Hg\n\nFigure 4. Spark Advance Curves for Distributor No. 3874082\n\nbelow the carburetor throttle plates. These exhaust gases dilute the incoming\n\ncharge, resulting in lower peak combustion temperatures and less NO, emissions.\n\nThe PCV system maintains a positive flow of crankcase blow-by gases into the\n\nengine intake system. Detailed descriptions of the emissions control system\n\nfor the stock vehicle can be found in Ref. 2.\n\nEGR SYSTEM\n\nThe Plymouth 6-cylinder engine for California automobiles uses EGR to\n\ncontrol nitrogen oxide .(NOx)\'emissions. A schematic of the elements of the\n\nEGR system is shown in Figure 5. The amount of exhaust gas which flows from\n\nthe exhaust manifold to the intake manifold is controlled by the position of\n\nthe poppet in the EGR valve. The position of the poppet is determined by the\n\ndifference in pressure between intake and exhaust manifolds and by the vacuum\n\nsupplied to a vacuum diaphragm attached to the poppet. In an attempt to make\n\nEGR proportional to engine air flow, the vacuum control signal is taken from\n\nthe carburetor venturi. This control signal is then amplified by a vacuum\n\namplifier which also senses intake manifold pressure. The vacuum signal from\n\nthe vacuum amplifier is supplied to the vacuum diaphragm for controlling the\n\npoppet position in the EGR valve.\n\nUnder some engine operating conditions, it is desirable to have no EGR.\n\nWhen the engine is idling, there is insufficient air flow to activate the EGR\n\nvalve. At wide-open-throttle (WOT), conditions, manifold vacuum is dumped\n\ninto the carburetor venturi vacuum signal by the dump valve in the vacuum\n\namplifier. This limits the vacuum signal to manifold vacuum, which is quite\n\nlow at WOT. The EGR valve is calibrated such that this vacuum is insufficient\n\nto open -the valve, thus preventing any EGR flow at WOT. EGR is also eliminated\n\nwhen the coolant control exhaust gas recirculation (CCEGR) valve indicates a\n\ncoolant outlet temperature less than 650 F.\n\nThe EGR delay solenoid is activated by the starter solenoid and inter\xc2\xad\nrupts the vacuum signal between the intake manifold and the vacuum amplifier\n\nduring cranking. The EGR delay timer deactivates this EGR delay solenoid\n\nafter 35 ,seconds of operation. The effect is to preclude EGR during cranking\n\nand for 35 seconds thereafter to assure reliable engine starting and operation\n\nimmediately after starting.\n\n5\n\nTO\nINTAKE\n\nFROM\nEXHAUST\nEGR\nVALVE\n\nVENTURI1\nCARBURETOR 5\n\nSOLENOID\nTEMPERATURE\nVALVE\n\nDEL~y\n\nFigure 6.\n\nEGR System Schematic\n\n\nTO ATMOSPHERE\nFROM\nAIR INCUEMVTION\nJNTAKEATMOSPHERE\nDMANIFOLDERDIPHAG\nMANIFL6\n1DIVERTER\n\n\nAIR \n\n\nE\n\n\n.PUMPVA\nTOWEACH HUTPR\n\n\nCHECK\nVALVE\n\nTO EACH EXHAUST PORT\n\nFigure 6.\n\nAIR System Schematic\n\n\nAIR SYSTEM\n\nExhaust-port air injection is used to provide excess air for oxidation\n\nof unburned hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide in the catalytic converter. A\n\nschematic of the elements of the air injection reactor (AIR) system is shown\n\nin Figure 6. The belt-driven airIpump is-mounted at the front of the engine\n\nwith power take-off at the crankshaft pulley. Intake air passes through a\n\ncentrifugal fan at the center of the pump, where foreign materials are\n\nseparated from the air by centrifugal force. The pump is a self-lubricating\n\nsliding vane centrifugal compressor.\n\nAir from the pump is delivered through a rubber hose to the air injection\n\nmanifold which is cast into the cylinder head. The air injection manifold\n\nroutes the compressed air to each of the exhaust ports. A check valve is\n\nlocated in the injection tube assembly that leads to the rear of the cylinder\n\nhead. This valve has a one-way diaphragm which prevents hot exhaust gases\n\nfrom backing up into the rubber hose and pump.\n\nA diverter valve located at the rear of the air pump housing diverts\n\nthe output of the air pump to the atmosphere through a silencer. During\n\nsudden throttle closing, valve action prevents exhaust system backfires.\n\nIntake manifold vacuum greater than some preset value causes the diverter\n\nvalve to open linearly with vacuum. A waste gate is an integral part of the\n\ndiverter valve. When the air pump output pressure reaches some preset value,\n\nthe waste gate allows any excess pressure to be bled off through the silencer.\n\nCATALYTIC CONVERTER\n\nA catalytic converter is used to oxidize hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide\n\nin the engine exhaust system. The converter consists of a stainless steel\n\nshell which contains two ceramic monolithic elements. These elements are\n\ncoated with a platinum/palladium catalyst. Unleaded fuel must be used to\n\nprevent catalyst poisoning. Special heat shields are used to protect under\xc2\xad\nbody and components from excessive heat.\n\nThe throttle position solenoid is activated by the electronic speed\n\nswitch when engine speed is above 2000 RPM, preventing the throttle from com\xc2\xad\npletely closing. This minimizes unburned hydrocarbons during high speed\n\ndecelerations which might otherwise overheat the converter causing the ceramic\n\nmonolith to melt.\n\nCOLD-START EMISSIONS SYSTEM\n\nThe California Plymouth with the 6-cylinder engine is equipped with a\n\nnumber of devices which are designed to reduce exhaust emissions during engine\n\nwarm-up. This cold-start emissions system includes the heated air inlet system,\n\nintake manifold hot spot, cold enrichment system, EGR system, and the evapora\xc2\xad\nive control system. A block diagram of this system is shown in Figure 7.\n\nHeated Air Inlet System\n\nInlet air to the carburetor is preheated to permit leaner carburetor\n\ncalibration for hydrocarbon control, improve engine warm-up characteristics\n\nand minimize carburetor icing.\n\n7\n\nENIEUL~\nCA\nNT\n\nNDER-HOOD\n--\n\nREAE\n\nCCIED ACRFNMTROMALTANLTED\nMANIFOD\n\xc2\xb0CLANER\n\nLTWEK\n\nTHROTTCI\n\nSNO\n\nNIHETjLDIAPHRAGM\n\nHEATED.\nJ~S\n\nVAH\n\'OLEIC\nEREO\nAIRSFRO(MIIN TA\nENMET\nRIH6TN\nAIRP\n\nMAIFL\n\n\'CEAGNE BETWE\n\nN\n\nAV\n\nIFL\n\nL\n\nINTAKEN\nMANIFOLDOK\n\nA\n\nVE\n\nEG K\nl\nJ\n\nAN\nM0-F FL\nE\n\nMNF\ninI\n\nTOLATI\nANRBT\n\nITCH\n\nJEX\n\nA S\nTAK INTKED.IATACUMR\n\nOPENVALVEN\n\nIGNIION\nSI\n\ngure\n\n7.\n\nO ENINE\nCodS\n\naISse\n\nANIFLD\no\n\n97\n\nICOLAN\n=yid\nHETtoHROS\nrPy\not\n\nC\n\nThe heated air system is basically a two-circuit air flow system. When\n\nthe under-hood air temperature is lO\xc2\xb0F or lower, carburetor intake air flows\n\nbetween the exhaust manifold and a metal shield and picks up exhaust heat.\n\nThe heated air then flows through a flexible line into the adapter on the\n\nbottom of the snorkel and into the carburetor. When the under-hood air\n\ntemperature is above 900F, the air flows directly through the snorkel.\n\nWhen the under-hood air temperature is between 100F and 900F, air flows\n\nthrough both circuits after the engine has been started. The quantity of air\n\nthrough each circuit is controlled by a vacuum-operated heat control door in\n\nthe snorkel to maintain a temperature of 850 to 950F at the temperature sensor\n\nmounted inside the air cleaner housing.\n\nWhen engine vacuum is below some preset value, a return spring over\xc2\xad\npowers the vacuum-operated heat control door and only unheated air enters the\n\ncarburetor.\n\nIntake Manifold Hot Spot\n\nA thermostatically-controlled heat control valve is located in the exhaust\n\nmanifold. During the engine warm-up period, the valve directs hot exhaust gases\n\nto the heat chamber (hot spot) in the intake manifold beneath the carburetor\n\nto help vaporize the fuel mixture.\n\nCold Enrichment\n\nThe cold enrichment system provides cold idle enrichment whenever the\n\nengine block coolant valve indicates that engine block temperature is below\n\n980F. A small vacuum-controlled diaphragm mounted near the top of the\n\ncarburetor controls idle system air. When control vacuum is applied to the\n\ndiaphragm, idle system air is reduced. Air losses strengthen the small vacuum\n\nsignal within the idle system and fuel flow increases.\n\nAn electric assist automatic choke system is used to reduce hydrocarbon\n\nand carbon monoxide emissi6ns during engine starting and warm-up. A single\n\nstage electric heating element located next to a bimetal spring inside the\n\nchoke well assists engine heat to shorten choke duration above 680F. Once the\n\ncontrol switch is heated to 1300F, the choke is shut off.\n\nEGR System\n\nEGR is eliminated when the coolant exhaust gas recirculation valve\n\n(CCEGR valve) indicates a coolant outlet temperature less than 650F.\n\nThe EGR delay solenoid is\nrupts the vacuum signal between\nduring cranking. The EGR delay\nafter 35 seconds of operation.\nand operation immediately after\n\nactivated by the starter solenoid and inter\xc2\xad\nthe intake manifold and the vacuum amplifier\n\ntimer deactivates this EGR delay solenoid\n\nThe effect is to- preclude EGR during cranking\n\nstarting.\n\n\n9\n\n\nEvaporative Emissions Control System\n\nWhile not a cold-start device per se, operation of the evaporative\n\nemissions control system during warmup affects the fuel/air ratio. This\n\neffect is presumed to be small.\n\nThe carburetor float bowl and fuel tank are sealed except for a vent to\n\nan activated charcoal cannister. The fuel tank vent opens when IPI >1/2 psig.\n\nAny vapors formed while the car is not running are absorbed onto the surface of\n\nthe charcoal.\n\nThe cannister is controlled by intake manifold vacuum such that when the\n\nengine is started, it will lower the pressure in the cannister and the hydro\xc2\xad\ncarbon vapors will desorb and be burned in the engine.\n\nBASELINE VEHICLE TESTS\n\nAfter completion of the break-in period and tune-up to factory specifica\xc2\xad\ntions, baseline chassis dynamometer tests of the vehicle were conducted at the\n\nSubaru test facility. Vehicle tests were not made on the JPL chassis\n\ndynamometer at the beginning of this effort because of facility unavailability.\n\nTo avoid delays, the JPL vehicle tests were conducted after completion of the\n\nengine dynamometer tests.\n\nThe Subaru testing included three tests each for the urban and highway\n\ndriving cycles. Both CVS-3 bag analysis and modal analysis of emissions were\n\nobtained for the urban cycle. Fuel economy results were obtained for both\n\nurban and highway cycles. Detailed results of these baseline vehicle tests\n\nare given in Appendix A, and are summarized in Table 2.\n\n\nTable 2.\n\nBaseline Vehicle Test Results (Subaru Facility)\n\n\n1975\n\nEPA\n\n\nCalifornia\nStandard\n\nTest\nNo. 1\n\nTest\nNo. 2\n\nTest\nNo. 3\n\nAverage\n\n0.9\n9.0\n2.0\n\n0.60\n3.47\n0.92\n14.90\n\n0.45\n3.70\n0.98\n14.57\n\n0.64\n4.02\n1.07\n14.79\n\n0.56\n\n3.73\n\n0.99\n\n14.75\n\n15\n\n\nHighway Driving Cycle\n\nFuel Economy, mpg\n\n20.11\n\n19.92\n\n19.92\n\n19.98\n\n20\n\n\nComposite Cycle\n\nFuel Economy, mpg\n\n16.87\n\n16.57\n\n16.75\n\n16.73\n\n17\n\n\nUrban Driving Cycle\n\nHC, g/mi\nCO, g/mi\nNOX, g/mi\nFuel Economy, mpg\n\n10\n\n\nCertified\n\nValues\n\n\nFuel economy values for both the urban and highway driving cycles are\n\nbased on the carbon balance techniques of Ref. 3. Urban driving cycle mile\xc2\xad\nages have been computed using the following equation.\n\n1975 FTP mpg\n\n=\n\n26895\n0.866 (g HC in bags 1, 2, and 3)\n\n(1)\n\n\n+ 0.429 (g CO in bags 1, 2, and 3),\n\n+ 0.273 (g CO2 in bags 1, 2, and 3)\n\nEmissions values needed in this calculation were based on "weighted" bag results\n\naccording to the following equation:\n\n(g emissions in bags 1, 2, and 3) = 0.43 (g emissions in bag 1)\n\n(2)\n\n\n+ 0.57 (g emissions in bag 3)\n+ 0.57 (g emissions in bag 3)\n\n+ (g emissions in bag 2)\nThis weighting is in agreement with that specified in the Federal Register,\n\nRef. 4. Composite fuel economy results were computed by assuming 55 percent\n\nurban driving and 45 percent highway driving. This is in accordance with\n\nRef. 5.\n\nBased on these results, the DOT vehicle is felt to be representative of\n\nthis engine/vehicle combination since the fuel economy data agree with EPA\n\ncertified results. The baseline emissions for the DOT vehicle (0.56 g/mi HC,\n\n3.73 g/mi CO, 0.99 g/mi NO\') compare favorably with the typical values given\n\non the window sticker for the 225 CID engine (0.4 g/mi HC, 3.6 g/mi cO,\n\n1.9 g/mi NOx).\n\nThe modal analysts of emissions which was used in the baseline tests\'is\n\nbased on dividing the 1371-second urban driving cycle into 66 modes for emis\xc2\xad\nsions evaluations. The modes are selected to represent primarily one of four\n\nkinds of vehicle operation: idle, acceleration, deceleration or constant\n\nspeed driving. The identification of this modal breakdown of the urban driv\xc2\xad\ning cycle is given in Table 3. A measure of the HC, CO, and NO, emissions is\n\nrecorded for each mode of the test. By adding the emissions from each mode,\n\nan estimate of the emissions over any portion of the driving cycle can be\n\nobtained.\n\nAlthough the modal emissions results provide some information about the\n\ndistribution of emissions during the driving cycle, the emissions obtained\n\nfrom the modal analysis differ considerably from bag results as shown in\n\nTable 4. The modal emissions tend to be much lower than the bag results\n\nespecially for bag 1 and bag 3, which collect the emissions from the first\n\n505 seconds of the driving cycle.\n\nInautomobiles which use oxidation catalyst for emission control, it is\n\nexpected that a large fraction of the total HC and CO emissions occur during\n\nthe cold-start part of the cycle while the catalyst is below its operating\n\n11\n\n\nTable 3.\n\nModal Breakdown of Urban Driving Cycle (Ref. 4),\n\nMODE TYPES: \t I = Idle\n\nA = Accelerate\n\nC = Cruise\n\nD = Decelerate\n\n\nMode\n\nMode\nType\n\nTime(s)\n\nAccumulated\nTime(s)\n\nMode\n34\n35\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\n41\n42\n43\n44\n45\n46\n47\n48\n49\n50\n51\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n\nI\nA\nC\nC\nD\nI\nA\nC\nC\nD\nI\nA\nC\nD\nI\nA\nD\nI\n\n20\n9\n33\n61\n12\n38\n41\n45\n50\n33\n19\n18\n18\n15\n5\n11\n15\n19\n\n20\n29\n62\n113\n125\n163\n204\n249\n299\n332\n351\n369\n387\n402\n407\n418\n433\n452\n\n19\n\nA\n\n16\n\n468\n\n52\n\n20\n21\n22\n23\n\nC\nD\nI\nA\n\n12\n12\n6\n15\n\n497\n509\n515\n530\n\n53\n54\n55\n56\n\n24\n\nC\n\n16\n\n546\n\n25\n26\n27\n28\n29\n30\n31\n32\n33\n\nD\nI\nA\nC\nD\nI\nA\nD\nI\n\n11\n15\n7\n35\n11\n24\n14\n21\n14\n\n557\n572\n579\n614\n625\n649\n663\n684\n698\n\nMode\nType\nA\nD\nA\nD\nA\nC\nC\nC\nD\nA\nC\nD\nI\nA\nD\nA\nC\nD\nI\nA\nD\nI\nA\n\n57\n\n58\n59\n60\n61\n62\n63\n64\n65\n66\n\nTime(s)\n\nAccumulated\n\nTime(s)\n\n\n19\n14\n18\n20\n17\n69\n61\n44\n10\n16\n34\n16\n30\n17\n30\n21\n18\n12\n\n717\n\n731\n\n749\n\n769\n\n786\n\n845\n\n906\n\n950\n\n960\n\n976\n\n1,010\n\n1,026\n\n1,056\n\n1,073\n\n1,103\n\n1,124\n\n1,142\n\n1,154\n\n\n16\n\n1,170\n\n\n9\n20\n1\n16\n\n1,179\n\n1,199\n\n1,200\n\n1,216\n\n\nC\n\n17\n\n1,233\n\n\nD\nI\nA\nC\nD\nI\nA\nD\nI\n\n12\n8\n26\n24\n11\n23\n13\n11\n10\n\n1,245\n\n1,253\n\n1,279.\n\n1,303\n\n1,314\n\n1,337\n\n1,350\n\n1,361\n\n1,371\n\n\ntemperature.

These plots again show the\n\nmuch higher HC and CO emissionswhich occur during the cold-start operation.\n\nThe N0 x emissions for the cold and hot tests are very similar, as expected.\n\nFor the cold transient test, each emissions value is shown normalized\n\nwith respect to its total emissions "for the test in Figure 11. Using this\n\nplot and Table 3, it is seen that 90 percent of the HC emissions in the cold\n\ntransient bag are collected during the first 5 minutes, while 90 percent of\n\nthe CO emissions come in the first 3 - 4 minutes.\n\nBASELINE ENGINE TESTS\n\nTo provide a good base from which to evaluate potential improvements in\n\nthe stock emission control systems, a complete engine mapping of the stock\n\nengine was conducted on a water brake dynamometer. Forty engine operating\n\nconditions were selected to cover the operating map. These points are shown\n\nin Figure 12. For these baseline tests, emissions measurements were made both\n\nupstream and downstream of the catalytic converter. Exhaust gas temperatures\n\nwere measured near the exhaust valve for each cylinder. EGR flow rate was\n\ncalculated using the air calibration data from cold-flow bench tests of the\n\nEGR valve. AIR flow rate was based on AIR pump calibration data. Calibration\n\ncurves for the EGR valve and AIR pump are included in Appendix B.\n\nA listing of the primary results of the stock baseline tests is given in\n\nTable 7. The fuel-to-air ratio is one of the key parameters which influences\n\nboth fuel economy and exhaust emissions. This parameter is expressed in terms\n\nof equivalence ratio which is defined as follows:\n\nMG\n(3)\n\nMA\n\nS\n\nwhere\n\nfuel/air equivalence ratio\n\nMG\n\n=\n\ngasoline flow rate\n\nMA\n\n=\n\nair flow rate\n\n\nS\n\nstoichiometric fuel-to-air ratio\n\n\nThe variation of equivalence ratio with manifold pressure for the baseline\n\ndata is given in Figure 13. The results for all engine speeds are shown on\n\nthe same plot, which accounts for some of the data scatter about the curve.\n\nThe stock carburetor is calibrated at an equivalence ratio of about 0.95 over\n\nthe mid-range with enrichments (4 > 1.0) at both light loads and wide-open\xc2\xad\nthrottle,(WOT) conditions.\n\n\n14\n\n\n3\nCOLD TRANSIENT\n\nU2\n\n\nHOT TASIENT\n\n0 2\n\n8\n\n6\n\n4\n\n14\n\n12\n10\nMODE\n\n16\n\n18\n\n20\n\n22\n\nFigure 8. \t Transient Mode HC Emissions for Baseline\n\nVehicle Over Urban Driving Cycle\n\n\n30\n\nMOD\n\n\nU\n\nCOLD TRANSIENT\n\nS20\n\nDo\n\nHOT TRANSIENT\n\nI\n\n0\n0 2\n\n4 \t\n\n6\n\n1\n\nI\t\n8\n\nI0\n\n12\nMODE\n\n1\n\n1\n\n14\n\n16\n\n8\n\n20\n\n22\n\n\nFigure 9. \tTransient Mode CO Emissions for Baseline\n\nVehicle Over Urban Driving Cycle\n\n\n15\n\n\n3\n\n2\n0\t\n\nz\n\nCOLD TRANSIENT\n\nu \n\n\nU\n\n-/\n\nHOT TRANSIENT\n\n\xc2\xad\n\n2\n\n0\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n12\nMODE\n\n\n14\n\n16\n\n\'18\n\n20\'\n\n22\n\n\nFigure 10. \t Transient Mode NO x Emissions for Baseline\n\nVehicle Over Urban Driving Cycle\n\n\n100\nI\n\n90\xc2\xad\n-\n\n80 \t\n\n/\n\nZ 70 \t\n0\n\n/\n\n-n \t\n\nE60 \xc2\xad\n0/\nS50\n\nIHC\n\nEMISSIONS\nE\n\n40-\n\n/\n\nZ-\n\nCO EMISSIONS\n\nNOx EMISSIONS\n\n\n/\n\n\n30\n\n/\n\n20\n\n/\n\n/\n10\n0\n\n2-\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n12\nMODE\n\n14\n\n16\n\n18 -20\n\n22\n\nFigure 11. \t Normalized Emissions for Baseline Vehicle\n\nOver Transient Mode of Urban Driving Cycle\n\n\nORIGINAL PAGE,\'\n\n16\n\nOF POOp QOITAIT\n\nYT\n\n0\n\n100-\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n0\n\n00\n80\n\n0\n\n0ORIGINAL\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n"60\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\nPAGE IS\n\nOF POOR QUALITY\n40\n\n0\n\n,0\n0\n\n1000\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n20-\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n2000\n\n3000\n\n0\n\n4000\n\nRPM\nFigure 12. \t Operating Conditions Used for Baseline\n\nTests of Stock Engine\n\nIt is convenient to define two new effective equivalence ratios which\n\naid in understanding the emissions results.

The data is seen to be consistent with .the spark advance\n\ncharacteristic based on a bench test of the distributor. The distributor\n\nvacuum advance mechanism acts to retard the spark timing\'as\'the throttle\n\napproaches the WOT conditions.\n\nThe effect of load on fuel consumption is illustrated in Figure 16.- As\n\nthe load is increased, BSFC decreases to a\'minimum value of about 0.47 Ibm/bhp-h\n\n\'for BMEP = 90 psi before increasing again at the WOT condition.\n\nThe N0x-emissions data for the stock engine i\'s shown in Figure 17\n\nplotted as a\'function of the effective\'equivalence ratio, fE. The effective\n\nequivalence ratio.includes the dilution effect of the EGR flow rate. As\n\nshown-in this data, the peak NO x emissions occur for a E of about 0.9.k The\n\nplot includes data for all engine speed and load conditions. The data also\n\nincludes a wide range of spark\'advance conditions with respect to minimum best\n\ntorque (MBT) timing. Since all of these factors affect the amount of NO x\n\nproduced in the combustion process, it is not surprising to ?ee. such,a wide\n\nvariation in the NO x \ndata.\n\nThe EGR schedule for the stock engine is shown in Figure 18 for 2000 RPM.\nFor this engine speed the percent EGR increases to a-maximum of about 30 per\xc2\xad\ncent at a BMEP = 20 psi and then decreases as the load is further increased;\nThe EGR is significantly reduced above a BMEP = 60 psi and becomes zero for\na BMEP = 100 psi.

In general, these emissions levels were met by using\n\nexhaust gas recirculation (EGR) and spark retard for NOx control, and cataly\xc2\xad\ntic converters for HC/CO control. The more stringent 1978 California emissions\n\nstandards are 0.4 g/mi HO, 9.0 g/mi CO, and 1.5 g/mi NOx over the urban driv\xc2\xad\ning cycle. In general, these standards are being met using similar emissions\n\ncontrol techniques, except for the few production vehicles which are using the\n\nthree-way catalyst approach. To maintain or improve air quality it will be\n\nnecessary to impose even more stringent emissions standards in future years.\n\nIn light of the recent energy crisis, it is imperative that these tighter\n\nemissions standards be met with little or no fuel economy penalty. The most\n\nstringent standards currently being proposed are the 0.41 g/mi HC, 3.4 g/mi\n\nC0, and 0.4 g/mi NOx levels. To meet these standards will require significant\n\nimprovements over existing production systems.\n\nAlthough catalytic converters have demonstrated their effectiveness for\n\ncontrolling HC/CO emissions once they reach steady-state operating temperature,\n\nHC and CO emissions are still a problem during cold engine starting and warm-up\n\nconditions. For most automobiles equipped with catalytic converters, over\n\n50 percent of the total HC/CO emissions are produced during the first several\n\nminutes of the urban driving cycle test while the engine is still cold. Thus,\n\nimproved cold-start emissions devices and techniques potentially offer large\n\npayoffs in meeting stricter HC/CO standards.\n\nThe cold-start emissions problem is an especially difficult one since the\n\nsystem must provide effective control of HC/CO emissions only a few seconds\n\nafter cranking a cold engine. The system must impose no severe driveability\n\npenalties, and it must have adequate durability. This problem is further\n\ncomplicated by the fact that some measures which are needed for NOx emissions\n\ncontrol and good fuel economy are detrimental to HC/CO emissions control.\n\nThis work included an evaluation of current production cold-start\n\nemissions systems (including the baseline vehicle system) as well as advanced\n\nsystems which have been proposed to reduce cold-start emissions. Based on\n\nthese evaluations, a modified cold-start system was implemented and tested.\n\nMost of the candidate cold-start approaches which have been identified\n\ncan be grouped under three categories: mixture control, combustion effects,\n\nand aftertreatment methods. Techniques which have been considered for improv\xc2\xad\ning mixture control include fuel atomization, fuel vaporization, closed-loop\n\ncontrol, modified choke operation, and better intake manifold design. In\n\napproaches involving the combustion process, spark retard, EGR shut-off, and\n\nimproved combustion chamber design have been shown to improve cold-start\n\nemission performance. Aftertreatment methods which have been considered\n\nJ nclude exhaust port liners, air injection, thermal reactors, start catalysts,\n\ncharcoal canisters, and fast warm-up of present catalyst systems.\n\n28\n\n\nMixture Control\n\nGood mixture control requires the delivery of a uniform distribution of\n\nGood equivalence ratio ( )\n\nhomogeneous charges to the engine cylinders.\ndistribution must be maintained on both a cylinder-to-cylinder and cygle-to\xc2\xad\ncycle basis. Although the need for charge homogeneity and good\ndistribution\n\nexists for all engine conditions, the requirement is more important during a\n\ncold start and warm-up of the engine, when engine heat is not readily avail\xc2\xad\nable for charge preparation. The choking which is necessary in a cold start\n\nThese\n\nfor good driveability increases the HC/CO emitted by the engine.\nemissions cannot be adequately handled by the catalytic converter until it\n\nreaches its light-off temperature.\n\nMany techniques show some promise of improving the quality of the fuel/\n\nair mixture being delivered to the cylinders during a cold start.\nThe best\n\nresults will probably be achieved through the use of a combination of the\n\napproaches discussed here.\n\nAtomization:\nThe purpose of all atomization approaches is to disperse\n\nfinely atomized fuel droplets into an airstream to produce a homogeneous\n\ncharge. Many techniques (Ref. 6) have been developed for accomplishing this\n\natomization. In an automotive application the atomized fuel droplets must\n\nremain suspended in the airstream as the mixture is distributed to the\n\ncylinders through the intake manifold. The impingement of fuel droplets on\n\nintake manifold walls and flow obstacles such as the throttle plate produces\n\nliquid-fuel films which hinder good distribution. Fuel droplet impingement\n\nis more severe during a cold start since the cold intake manifold is ineffec\xc2\xad\ntive at vaporizing the fuel film.\n\nStudies (Ref. 6) indicate that atomization to fuel droplet sizes of\n\n10-20 microns is required to provide adequate droplet suspension in automobile\n\nintake systems.\nThis level of-fuel atomization, coupled with a low-impact\n\nintake manifold which is heated to improve fuel vaporization, should help\n\n.- inimize the liquid-fuel film. Manifold design will be discussed in a later\nm\nsection. Good atomization should reduce the need for p enrichment (choking)\nduring cold-start operation, and lessened choking should reduce HC/CO\nemissions.\nMost atomization methods can be grouped according to the technique used\n\nto atomize the liquid:\ntwo-fluid atomization, pressure atomization, ultra\xc2\xad\nsonic atomization, spinning-disc atomization, or electrostatic atomization.\n\nSome devices use combinations of these approaches to promote better fuel\n\natomization.\n\nThe two-fluid atomization technique is based on atomizing the liquid fuel\n\nby the action of air on the liquid. In this method the droplet size produced\n\ndecreases with increasing velocity of the atomizing air. To achieve droplet\n\nsizes in the desired 10-20 micron range requires air atomization velocities\n\nof about 500 ft/sec. Most conventional .carburetors use venturi-type atomizers\n\nbased on the two-fluid technique. Because of the wide range of air flow rates\n\nrequired by an engine, fixed-venturi carburetors tend to provide good fuel\n\natomization only near their maximum flow rates. Some carefully designed\n\nmultiple barrel carburetors (Refs. 7, 8) have been successful at achieving\n\ngood fuel atomization over a broader operating range.\n\n\n29\n\n\nThe new variable-throat sonic carburetor being developed by Dresser\n\nIndustries (Refs. 9, 10) achieves its fuel atomization primarily by the two\xc2\xad\nfluid technique. The carburetor operates in the choked condition for mani\xc2\xad\nfold pressures of less than about 3 inches Hg, a level which maintains high\n\nair velocities for good atu.cation for most operating conditions. Fuel is\n\nsupplied upstream of the throat so that fluid droplets pass through the high\n\nvelocity throat region to be broken up. The airstream attains supersonic\n\nvelocities just downstream of the throat and then passes through a normal\n\nshock wave to return to subsonic velocities. Further atomization of the fuel\n\ndroplets occurs as they pass through this normal shock wave. In this system\n\nno downstream throttle plate is required since airflow is controlled by moving\n\nthe fuel supply bar to adjust the carburetor throat area. The removal of the\n\ndownstream throttle plate should help minimize the impingement of fuel drop\xc2\xad\nlets in the intake system.\n\nThe Hartmann-whistle atomizer (Ref. 11), currently under development for\n\nautomotive use, is another two-fluid atomization technique. In this system a\n\nsecondary flow of high-velocity air is supplied along with the fuel to a small\n\nresonating cavity which produces ultrasonic waves to aid in atomizing the fuel.\n\nThis fuel/air mixture is then mixed with the-primary engine air in a highly\n\nturbulefit pledum\nThe air throttle is located upstream of the atomizer unit,\n\nan arrangement which should help reduce fuel impingement in the intake system.\n\nPressure atomization is based on the use of fuel pressure as the driving\n\nforce for atomization. The most widely used form of this approach employs a\n\nswirl-type nozzle which produces a hollow, conically-shaped fuel spray. With\n\nthis technique it is difficult to get droplet sizes less than 50 microns.\n\nThis fact places certain limitations on its use in the automobile application.\n\nIt would also require the use of a pressurized fuel supply.\n\nIn ultrasonic-atomization, liquid fuel flows over a vibrating surface\n\nand is\'Atomized by forces generated in the fluid by mechanical agitation.\n\nFuel droplet size decreases with increasing agitation frequency, but the\n\natomizing capaci-ty per-unit of atomizing surface falls off with increasing\n\nfrequency. An ultrasonic atomizer\'operating at 100 kHz could deliver the\n\ndesired 10<2,0-micron fuel droplets; however, this is near the upper frequency\n\nlimit for good flow capacity.\n\nIn ithe spinning-disc atomization technique, droplets of fuel are thrown\n\nfrom the edge\'of a high-speed rotating disc into an airstream for atomization.\n\nFuel droplet -size decreases with increasing disc radius and disc RPM. At .a\n\ndisc speed of 45,000 RPM, a 2-inch-radius disc should be capable of providing\n\n10-20 micron fuel droplets.\n\nElectrostatic atomization is based on subjecting the free surface of\n\nfuel to an intense electric field. Although this technique shows promise,\n\nmore resehrch is required before it is ready for automotive application.\n\nVaporization: Because of intake manifold geometry and inadequate fuel\natomization, engines frequently operate with liquid gasoline flowing along\nintake manifold walls.\' The presence of this liquid film in the intake system\nleads to large variations in \' between cylinders (Refs. 6, 12, 13).\nSome\nbasic studies of mixture preparation (Refs. 13, 14, 15) have been carried out\n\n30\n\n\nusing prevaporized fuel in premixed fuel/air mixtures to examine the benefits\n\nof good mixture control. In all cases the vaporized fuel system gave an\n\nimproved cylinder-to-cylinder 4 distribution; however, fuel vaporization alone\nis not adequate to eliminate maldistribution (Refs. 13, 16). Good mixing of\n\n\'the vaporized fuel with the airstream is still extremely important in achiev\xc2\xad\ning good distribution. In warmed-up engines, fuel vaporization consistently\n\nreduces CO emissions; however, in some cases only slight reductions in HC\n\nemissions are observed (Ref. 14).\nIt is expected that significant reductions\n\nin HC/CO emissions during engine warm-up operation are possible through fuel\n\nvaporization.\n\nPreheating all or part of the intake mixture has been used as a means of\n\nimproving engine warm-up characteristics and aiding fuel vaporization during a\n\ncold start. Most current production vehicles have preheat systems which take\n\nenergy from the exhaust manifold to increase the temperature of the inducted\n\nair. The systems are thermostatically controlled so that they operate only\n\nduring engine warm-up. The preheating results in a loss in volumetric effi\xc2\xad\nciency, but since it is used only during the warm-up mode, the loss is\n\nacceptable.\n\nSome effort has been made to develop practical ways of implementing the\n\nfuel vaporization technique-for mixture control. One such approach uses a\n\nheat pipe (Ref. 17) (Vapipe) which provides heat transfer from the exhaust\n\ngases-to the.intake fuel/air mixture. The fuel is vaporized as the fuel/air\n\nmixture passes over the tubes which form the condenser section of the heat\n\npipe. Although Vapipe was developed for one specific engine, test results\n\nindicate significant improvements in economy and emissions, with good drive\xc2\xad\nability. Some (Ref. 10) have expressed doubts that the Vapipe system could\n\nbe used to reduce cold-start emissions because of the time required to bring\n\nthe heat pipe to full operating temperature. It has been demonstrated\n\n(Ref. 17) that existing designs of the Vapipe can be brought from 320 F to full\n\n-operating temperature within 1 minute. It is expected that, with further\n\ndevelopment, start-up time can be reduced.\n\nOther systems (Refs. 10,1, 18) transfer heat directly from the exhaust\n\ngas to a portion of the intake manifold to promote fuel vaporization. One\n\nsystem under development by Ethyl Corporation (Ref. 6) passes the entire pri\xc2\xad\nmary fuel/air mixture through a small sheet metal box (hot-box) which is com\xc2\xad\npletely surrounded by the exhaust gas in the exhaust crossover area. During\n\nengine warm-up a-thermostatically-controlled valve directs the exhaust gases\n\nthrough the crossover area. The valve reduces flow through the crossover once\n\nthe engine is warm. Tests of this hot-box manifold have demonstrated good\ncylinder-to-cylinder\ndistribution.\n\n\xc2\xad\n\nMost production vehicles utilize exhaust gases to heat a hot spot in the\n\nintake manifold during engine warm-up operation. This hot spot is usually\n\nlocated at a point where fuel impingement on the manifold wall is probably due\n\nto manifold geometry. Continuing work is being done in improving the effec\xc2\xad\ntiveness of the hot spot to develop an early-fuel-evaporation (EFE) system\n\n(Ref. 18). The objective of an EFE system is to achieve good fuel vaporization\n\n\n31\n\nORIGINAL PAGE IS\nOF POOR QUALITY\n\n20 seconds after an engine start so that the choke can be removed early, to\n\nreduce cold-start emissions. The three principal requirements in designing\n\nan EFE system are\n\n(1)\n\nUse a heating surface with a low thermal mass to achieve fast\ntemperature rise.\n\n(2)\n\nVaporize the fuel without heating the air.\n\n(3)\n\nMaintain fuel contact with heating surface until vaporized.\n\nBoth exhaust gases and electrical energy (Ref. 19) have been used in experi\xc2\xad\nments on advanced EFE systems. The results of these experiments have shown\n\na considerable reduction in cold-start CO emissions, but only a slight reduc\xc2\xad\ntion in cold-start HC emissions.\n\nClosed-Loop Control: In recent years it has become increasingly impor\xc2\xad\ntant to provide better control of engine variables to as to meet the emissions\n\nconstraints with increasing fuel economy. Some advanced emissions control\n\ndevices, such as the three-way catalyst system, require very precise control\n\nof engine equivalence ratio for acceptable performance. The need for more\n\nflexible, precise control of engines has led to increased interest in the use\n\nof electronic controls on automobiles.\n\nIn the 1975 model year an electronic spark control system is being used\n\nwith a lean-burn engine (Ref. 20) to achieve emissions control without the use\n\nof add-on devices. This system instantaneously senses engine condition,\n\nanalyzes these inputs to determine the needed action, and produces the actua\xc2\xad\nting signals needed to accomplish this action. The input signals used are\n\n(1) engine condition when started, (2) engine RPM, (3) intake manifold pres\xc2\xad\nsure, (4) throttle position, (5) rate of change of throttle position, (6)\n\nintake air temperature, and (7) coolant temperature. These inputs are used\n\nto determiine the signal needed by the electronic distributor to fire the\n\nspark plugs at the optimum time for all engine conditions.\n\nand\n\nAn active feedback control system which automatically selects the\nspark advance for minimum fuel consumption is currently under development\n\nand spark advance to maximize output power,\n(Ref. 21). The controls adjust\nand spark advance to be off-optimum. For a\nregardless of what caused the\nfixed gasoline flow, optimizing for maximum power also results in best fuel\neconomy. Although this particular system is set up for a lean-burn engine\napplication, similar type closed-loop control systems could be developed\nusing other control strategies. A more flexible means of controlling 4 and\nspark advance during engine warm-up would no doubt result in better fuel\neconomy and reduced emissions.\nIn the use of thermal manifold reactors for emissions control, tests\n\n(Ref. 22) indicate a significant improvement in CO emissions control when a\n\nmodulated secondary air system is used. The secondary air is \'controlled to\n\nmaintain a constant tailpipe air/fuel ratio by sensing engine RPM and intake\n\nmanifold pressure. Carbon monoxide emissions are reduced for both cold-start\n\nand warmed-up engine operation.\n\n\n32\n\n\n.Closed-loop controls have been used in tests of the three-way catalyst\n\nemissions control systems (Ref. 23).\nIn three-way or dual catalyst systems,\n\nit is necessary to maintain\n= 1.0 within very close tolerances for proper\n\ncatalyst effectiveness. In these tests an oxygen sensor in the exhaust mani\xc2\xad\nfold was used to\'control the fuel injection system. The durability of the\n\noxygen sensor and the catalyst systems used in this approach have not been\n\nproven at this time.\n\nModified Choke Operation: When a cold engine is being started, much of\n\nthe fuel delivered by the carburetor impinges on the cold walls of the intake\n\nmanifold because of inadequate atomization and vaporization. To insure an\n\nadequate fuel supply to the cylinders, a choke is used to restrict the flow of\n\nair and supply a rich mixture during warm-up. As the engines warms up, the\n\nchoke\'is opened by a thermostatically-controlled valve.\n\nWith the current HC/C0 emissions standards, it has become necessary to\n\nlean taL choke calibrations in order to minimize HC/CO emissions during\n\nwarm-up. It is also desirable to minimize the time that the choke stays on.\n\nSome production vehicles use an electric heating element to assist the engine\n\nheat in shortening choke duration. Even with these choke modifications,\n\napproximately 50 percent of the HC/CO emissions produced during the urban\n\ndriving cycle occur during engine warm-up.\n\nMuch work is being done on early-fuel-evaporation systems (Ref. 18)\n\nwhich would make a quick choke possible. Significant modifications in choke\n\noperation must await implementation of improved early-fuel-evaporation systems.\n\nIntake System Design-- -Some of the -methods of mixture control which have\nbeen discussed are closely related to intake system design. Studies (Ref. 6)\nhave indicated that it is desirable to have an intake system which is free of\nobstacles such as throttle plates. Many times intake manifold geometry is\ndetermined by the space available, which leads to the use of nonoptimum shapes.\nMost current automobiles have the throttle plate downstream of the carburetor\nand have at least one sharp bend in the intake manifold, leading to fuel\nimpingement and poor distribution. Som advanced carburetor designs (Ref. 9)\nhave air throttles upstream of the.fuel introduction point, and this results\nin less fuel impingement.\nTo alleviate-the problem of fuel impingement in the intake manifold,\n\nmuch\'effort (Refs. 11, 18) is being made to improve the design of intake mani\xc2\xad\nfold hot spots and to develop more advanced early-fuel-evaporation systems.\n\nThese systems are especially important during cold-start operation when the\n\nintake manifold is cold.\n\nAnother promising design under development is the three-barrel carburetor\n\nand dual induction manifold system (Ref. 7). The three-barrel carburetor has\n\na small primary venturi for idle and light-load operation with two secondary\n\nbarrels to provide full power. This carburetor gives better fuel atomization\n\nover a range of engine operating conditions. The dual manifdld system uses\n\nhigh velocities for good mixing and increased evaporation. A small diameter\n\nmanifold supplied by the primary barrel of the three-barrel carburetor sup\xc2\xad\nplies mixtures to the engine during idle and light-load operation. A separate\n\nlarge diameter manifold supplied by the two secondary barrels of the carbure\xc2\xad\ntor is used for full power.\n\n\n33\n\nORIGINAL PAG\n\nIS\n\nOF POOR QUALITY\n\nCombustion Methods\n\nOnce the fuel/air mixture has been prepared in the engine intake system,\n\nthe HC/CO emissions which leave the engine are determined by the combustion\n\nchamber geometry and the combustion process itself. The amount of exhaust\n\ngas recirculation (EGR) used and the spark timing strategy have first-order\n\neffects on the emissions characteristics of the engine. Other engine factors\n\nsuch as combustion chamber shape, crevice volume, and valve overlap can also\n\nbe important aspects of an engine design. Discussion in the following sec\xc2\xad\ntions will be limited to consideration of EGR and spark timing effects.\n\nSpark Control: Many aftertreatment techniques for control of HC/CO\n\nemissions require that the exhaust system be warmed up before they become\n\neffective. During cold-start operation it is important to minimize the time\n\nrequired for this warm-up process. Spark retard during engine warm-up has\n\nbeen used effectively to increase exhaust temperatures (Ref. 19). When used\n\nin conjunction with air-injected reactors, this increased exhaust temperature\n\nhelps promote thermal reaction of HC/CO by warming up the system much faster.\n\nWhen spark retard is used with catalyst systems, the higher exhaust tempera\xc2\xad\ntures speed catalyst warm-up and lead to high catalyst conversion efficien\xc2\xad\ncies earlier after engine starting. The amount and duration of the spark\n\nretard required depend on each particular application. An anti-stall device\n\nis used to deactivate the system when manifold vacuum falls below a set value\n\nto minimize stalling and improve driveability during engine warm-up.\n\nIn addition to having an effect on the HC/CO conversion efficiency of\n\ncatalysts and thermal reactors during engine warm-up, spark retard also\n\naffects the amount of HC emissions which leave the combustion chamber.\n\nSpark retard causes more of the combustion process to occur during the\n\nexpansion stroke, and this reduces the HC emissions due to the decreased sur\xc2\xad\nface/volume during combustion (Ref. 24). Spark retard has little effect on\n\nCO emissions except at very retarded timing where there is insufficient time\n\nto complete CO oxidation.\n\nEGR Shut-Off: Exhaust gas recirculation has been used effectively as a\n\nmeans of controlling NOx emissions; however, there are several reasons why it\n\nis not desirable during cold-start operation. First, EGR adversely affects\n\nvehicle driveability, which is already somewhat impaired with a cold engine.\n\nSecondly, EGR dilutes the mixture, and this yields lower combustion tempera\xc2\xad\ntures and aggravates HC emissions (Ref. 25).\nIn some applications a time\n\ndelay switch is used to deactivate the EGR during the warm-up period of a\n\ncold start.\n\nAftertreatment Methods\n\nHydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions that are produced in an\n\nengine can be reduced by various aftertreatment techniques. The most impor\xc2\xad\ntant aftertreatment device in current use is the oxidation catalyst. Although\n\noxidation catalysts have demonstrated their effectiveness for controlling\n\nHC/CO emissions once they reach steady-state operating temperature, HC/CO\n\nemissions still pose a problem during engine starting and warm-up operation.\n\nIn general, aftertreatment methods attempt to promote additional HC/CO\n\noxidation in the exhaust system. Factors which are needed for effective\n\n\n34\n\n\noxidation are an excess of oxidizing agent (air), a high exhaust temperature,\n\nsufficientresidence time, and perhaps the presence of catalytic material.\n\nThe requirements for a high exhaust temperature and/or a warm catalyst bed\n\nmake these methods less effective for controlling cold-start HC/CO emissions.\n\nAftertreatment methods which have been considered include exhaust port\n\nliners, air injection, thermal reactors, start catalysts, charcoal canisters,\n\nand fast warm-up of present catalyst systems. These techniques are discussed\n\nbriefly in the following sections.\n\nExhaust Port Liners:\nInsulating exhaust ports and exhaust manifolds\n\nwith internal liners is a simple and effective way to maintain high tempera\xc2\xad\ntures in the exhaust system. This is especially important during cold-start\n\noperation, when the exhaust system (including the exhaust catalyst) is cold.\n\nThe insulation provided by the exhaust system liners reduces the thermal\n\nenergy loss of the exhaust products during the first few minutes of engine\n\noperation. This has the effect of decreasing the catalyst warm-up time.\n\nTests (Ref. 8) have shown that the addition of exhaust port liners reduces HC\n\nemissions by 10-20 percent. Insulating the exhaust pipes and increasing the\n\nexhaust manifold volume by 2-1/2 times resulted in an additional 20-40 percent\n\nreduction in HC emissions.\n\nOne potential drawback of this approach may occur under steady-state\n\noperation. Under high speed/load conditions, the increased exhaust tempera\xc2\xad\ntures may lead to reduced catalyst life. It is not clear how much hotter\n\ncatalyst bed temperatures will-run in this case since the increased exhaust\n\ntemperatures will cause additional HC reaction to occur upstream of the\n\ncatalyst bed.\n\nAir Injection: Many current vehicles, especially those sold in\n\nCalifornia, use air injection into the exhaust manifold as a means of supply\xc2\xad\ning the excess air needed for HC/CO oxidation. Although simple in principle,\n\ncontrolling the air injection flow rate to get maximum effectiveness in oxi\xc2\xad\ndizing hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide presents a -ifficult problem. As\n\npreviously mentioned, high exhaust temperatures and a sufficient residence\n\ntime are also required for effective oxidation to take place.\n\nSingle-cylinder engine and vehicle studies (Ref. 26) have demonstrated\n\nthat the temperature, composition, and residence time of the exhaust gas-air\n\nmixture are the basic factors which determine the effectiveness of air injec\xc2\xad\ntion and the type of oxidation process which occurs in the exhaust system.\n\nBoth luminous and nonluminous oxidation have been observed. These basic\n\nfactors are affected by engine spark timing and equivalence ratio, insulation\n\nand size of the exhaust manifolds, flow rate and temperature of the injected\n\nair, and thd warm-up characteristics of the air injection system.\n\nIt was found that the lowest HC/CO emissions obtained with air injection\n\nwere achieved in the luminous oxidation regime (equivalence ratios between\n\n1.05 and 1.30). In the past this fact has led to the use of rich carburetor\n\ncalibrations to help with emissions control. Efforts have been made to extend\n\nthe luminous oxidation regime to lower equivalence ratios to get better fuel\n\neconomy while maintaining the desirable emissions\'control characteristics.\n\n\n35\n\n\nThe optimum air flow requirements for HC and GO emissions reduction were\n\nabout the same in the luminous oxidation regime; however, the optimum air flow\n\nrequirement for GO was four to five times greater than the optimum air flow\n\nrequirement for HC when in the nonluminous oxidation regime (4<l.05). Since\n\ncarburetors typically have nonlinear calibrations, it is usually necessary to\n\noptimize the air injection flow rate to obtain either the lowest HC or GO\n\nemissions. At any rate, some compromise is required in setting up a control\n\nstrategy. Modulated air injection systems have shown advantages in control\xc2\xad\nling HC/CO emissions by maintaining a constant tailpipe air/fuel ratio.\n\nThe desire to achieve better efficiencies from air-injected reactors at\n\nleaner equivalence ratios has led to studies (Ref. 27) of ways to improve the\n\nmixing of the injected air with the exhaust gas. It was found that improved\n\nmixing of the secondary air and exhaust gas can substantially increase the\n\nHC/CO conversion efficiency.\n\nAlthough air injection can be very effective in oxidizing HC and-CO in\n\nthe engine exhaust under favorable temperature and composition conditions, its\n\ncold-start performance is limited by the warm-up characteristics of the exhaust\n\nsystem. Air injection alone cannot be used for cold-start emissions control;\n\nit must be combined with other techniques such as exhaust port and mani\xc2\xad\nfold insulation, spark retard, etc. if it is to be effective.\n\nThermal Reactors: Thermal reactors are exhaust system elements that\n\nattempt to maintain a high exhaust temperature in the presence of Air for\n\nsufficient time to oxidize the HC/CO in the exhaust. Studies (Ref. 26) tave\n\nshown that thermal reactors are better at reducing HC/CO emissions when\n\nengines are operated in the rich regime (1.05 <p< 1.30).\nThis results in a\n\nsignificant fuel economy penalty for systems using the thermal reactor. The\n\nrecent interest in fuel economy has led to an increased interest in lean\xc2\xad\nburning thermal reactors (Ref. 28).\n\nNot much information is available on the operating characteristics of\n\nlean-burning thermal reactors. A lean-burning reactor will be temperature\n\nlimited to slightly above the exhaust temperature. Additional work is required\n\nto help understand the important influences and how to separate their effects\n\nto optimize lean-burning reactor systems.\n\nThe large reactor volumes required to get the needed residence time make\n\nthermal reactors produce relatively large quantities of cold-start emissions.\n\nThis fact makes good insulation and a low thermal mass almost mandatory for\n\nthermal reactor systems.\n\nCharcoal Canisters:\nCharcoal is available in numerous types and in\n\nvarious mesh sizes. Charcoal is used commercially for scrubbing organic\n\nvapors of all types, e.g., halides, carbonyls, aromatics, paraffins, etc.,\n\nfrom gaseous streams prior to venting. Many of the processes in use reclaim\n\nthe adsorbed organic species after the charcoal bed becomes saturated (which\n\nis indicated by the "breakthrough" of the organic species downstream from the\n\nbed).\nThe common procedure for removing the organic compounds requires heat\xc2\xad\ning of the charcoal and usually this is accompanied by steam, for which char\xc2\xad\ncoal has very little affinity. To maintain the greatest working adsorptive\n\ncapacity\'of the charcoal, it is desirable to be able to clean off as much of\n\nORIGINAL PAGE IS\n\n36\n\nOP POOR QUALITY\n\nthe adsorbed species at aslow a temperature as possible without suffering\n\ndegradation of the adsorbed species alter the charcoal has become saturated.\n\nIt is \t\nimportant to note that charcoal operating under dynamic conditions has\n\ndifferent adsorptive properties than under static conditions. In deter\xc2\xad\nmining. the effectiveness of a charcoal adsorber, the properties ,of the gaseous\n\nstream passing through the charcoal - its temperature, pressure, velocity,\nmoisture content, and concentration of-the gases to be adsorbed - are as\n\nimportant as the type and size of charcoal, its moisture content and reac\xc2\xad\ntivity.\n\nA charcoal canister on an engine exhaust would be required to function\n\nunder conditions involving all of the above parameters which apply to a dyna\xc2\xad\nmic system. However; two additional problems arise: continuous and high\n\nmoisture conteit bf the gaseous stream and the range of temperatures encoun\xc2\xad\ntered during engine warm-up. The effect of the first would be to desorb all\n\nadsorbed hydrocarbons. The desorption would be a function of the rate of\n\nincrease in steam temperature, the amount and activity of charcoal used, and\n\nthe concentration of hydrocarbons. Increasing temperature can cause serious\n\ndeterioration of the charcoal\'s adsorbing surface; oxidation, and possibly\n\ncombustion, will take place at the higher temperatures (- 750 0 F). The char\xc2\xad\ncoal\'used in this application must meet special requirements; it must\n\n(1) \t Not~oxidize readily at lower temperatures (660-7509F is\n\nacceptable).\n\n(2) \t Have high\'affinity for saturated, unsaturated, and oxygenated\n\nhydrocarbons.\n\n(3) \t\'Be in a form which will create little backpressure in the exhaust\n\nsystem.\n\n(4) \t Have a high working capacity (i.e., adsorption, desorption).\n\nIn addition, the ideal system would necessarily have excellent high\n\ntemperature valves to allow bypassing the carbon canister after engine.\n\nwarm-up. Provision should also be made to permit flushing the cahister back\n\ninto the exhaust system upstream of the catalyst bed. The length of time\n\nduring which the exhaust could be diverted through the canister before hydro\xc2\xad\ncarbon breakthrough and oxidation of the carbon occur would depend on the size\n\nof the carbon bed, concentration of hydrocarbons, adsorptive character of the\n\n.carbon, oxidation point of the carbon, rate of increase in temperature, and\n\nsteam \t\ncontent of the exhaust gas. Any degradation of the charcoal or deposi\xc2\xad\ntion of polymers on metal particulates will change the working ability of\n\nthe charcoal and could destroy it. It must be stressed that this\'system is\n\nmerely a storage system for hydrocarbbns and does not oxidize hydrocarbons\n\nnor does it store carbon.monoxide. The removal of carbon monoxide during\n\ncold starts is not affected by the use of charcoal canisters.\n\nExhaust Catalysts: Improvements in reducing the cold-start hydrocarbon\n\nconcentrations by dual and three-way catalyst systems can be achieved by many\n\n\n3T\n\n\nof the same methods. The various avenues available for improving cold-start\n\ncatalytic activity include\n\n(1) \t More active oxidation catalysts which "light-off" at lower\n\ntemperatures (300r 4 000 F).\n\n(2) \t Catalyst beds electrically heated for faster activation.\n\n(3) \t More heat resistant catalysts, located closer to or in the exhaust\n\nmanifold either alone or in conjunction with either of the two\n\ncatalyst systems.\n\n(4) \t Secondary catalysts used only for cold-start periods and which are\n\nmore active than the primary catalysts that are located in the\n\nexhaust system.\n\nAny increase in activity in the catalytic oxidation at lower temperatures\n\nmust not reduce the maximum temperature durability of the catalyst. An\n\nincrease in operating temperature range is presently being pursued by industry;\n\nhowever, the most recent advances in this area are proprietary.\n\nIi must be emphasized that at the lower light-off temperatures achiev\xc2\xad\nable by these two catalyst systems, the ability to start the engine richer and\n\nthereby aid in shortening the start-up time with the dual catalyst is not now\n\napplicable to the three-way catalyst. However, if a bypass of the signal from\n\nthe oxygen sensor in the three-way catalyst system were available during\n\nstart-up, richerconditions might then be applied to it also. The extent to\n\nwhich decreasing the air/fuel ratio results in a gain in shorter light-off\n\n\t\ntime and lower hydrocarbon concentrations during told start is not known at\n\nthis time.\n\nElectrical heating of the catalyst to improve its cold-start performance\n\nis not a new concept, but some novel approaches make this method worthy of\n\nfurther investigation. Use of a non-noble metal for current conduction to\n\nheat the exhaust gases prior to entry into the oxidation catalyst is one\n\nscheme which looks promising. Another possibility is to use a semiconductor\n\nas the catalyst support and heat the catalyst directly by passing the current\n\nthrough the support.\n\nThe use of a secondary, "fast-start" catalyst for cold starts has the\n\nadvantage that, being located close to the exhaust manifold, the catalyst\n\nheats up faster. However, a disadvantage of this system is that valves are\n\nneeded in the exhaust system to direct the flow through the secondary cata\xc2\xad\nlyst until the exhaust reaches the temperature at which the primary catalyst\n\ncan oxidize the hydrocarbons. Its capability for removing cold-start hydro\xc2\xad\ncarbons should, however, be examined.\n\nIn general, the improvement of the catalyst in order to reduce cold\xc2\xad\nstart hydrocarbon emissions offers several viable alternatives and at the\n\nsame time reduces carbon monoxide concentration.\n\n\n38\n\n\nMODIFIED COLD-START SYSTEM\n\nThe cold-start systemron-the baseline Plymouth vehicle is discussed in\n\nSection II. Other production cold-start-systems have been analyzed, as have\n\nproposed advanced systems for controlling cold-start emissions. Based on these\n\nevaluations, a modified cold-start system was selected for-implementation and\n\ntesting on the vehicle. Modifications were made in mixture preparation,\n\nexhaust energy flow, catalyst performance, and choke operation. A block\n\ndiagram of the modified cold-start system is given in Figure 26.\n\nIntake manifold changes were made to improve the effectiveness of the\n\nmanifold hot spot. In the stock configuration the hot spot is located directly\n\nunder the carburetor and is heated by exhaust gases directed to the hot spot\n\nplenum by a thermostatically-controlled heat control valve in the exhaust\n\nmanifold. The incoming fuel/air mixture impinges directly on the hot spot\n\narea before making a 90-degree turn into the manifold runners. The exhaust\n\ngas recirculation (EGR) entrance tube is located in the center of the hot\n\nspot and directs the EGR into the intake manifold in a direction opposite\n\nto that of the incoming fuel/air mixture. The stock manifold is quite\n\nmassive in the hot spot area, which results in a slow warm-up. To augment\n\nthis method of heating the hot spot, an electrically-heated coil was\n\ninstalled in the hot spot area in the floor of the manifold. This supplies\n\nadditional energy for fuel vaporization until the exhaust gases have time\n\nto heat the floor of the intake manifold.\n\nThe EGR shutoff control was studied through a series of sensitivity tests\n\nto determine the best emissions performance. The amount and duration of choke\n\noperation was also examined during engine warm-up. A more flexible method of\n\ncontrol for spark advance was implemented to permit an evaluation of alternate\n\ncold-start spark advance strategies.\n\nImprovements in catalyst effectiveness during cold-start operation were\n\naccomplished by providing for a fast warm-up of the existing stock catalyst\n\nunit and installing a start catalyst to be used only during engine starting\n\nand warm-up. These two approaches permitted an evaluation of the relative\n\nmerits of these alternatives. Flow through the start catalyst was controlled\n\nby a damper valve which responds to the bed temperature in the start catalyst\n\nunit. This provides protection against overheating of the start catalyst.\n\nThe stock catalyst unit contains two ceramic monolithic elements which\n\nare coated with a catalytic agent consisting of a mixture of palladium and\n\nplatinum. This catalyst unit was modified to permit the installation of an\n\nadditional heated monolithic element to decrease the catalyst warm-up time.\n\nThis auxiliary heating was accomplished electrically with the energy being\n\nsupplied by an external power supply.\n\nEGR COLD-START CONTROL\n\nThe baseline emission control system has a means for preventing opera\xc2\xad\ntion of the EGR system during\'the warm-up period after a cold start. As pre\xc2\xad\nviously discussed, this is desirable for several reasons. EGR adversely\n\naffects driveability, which, -with a cold engine, is already impaired. The\n\naddition\'of EGR to the fuel/air mixture lowers combustion temperatures and\n\nleads to higher HC emissions.\n\n39\n\n\nl\nD\nUNE-OAIR\nAIR-HO\nAIR\nHEATED AIR FROM\n\n__ ELy\nTM\nSTC:\n\n_[INI|O\nH\n\nI\n\n[CONTROL\n\n]\n\nSWI\n\nH\n\nA\n\nU\n\n\nCLEANER\nI\n\nTEMP SENSOR IN AIR\nCANR\nBETWEEN\n\nELECTRIC ASSIST\n\nVACUUM\nDIAPHRAGM\n\nCARBURETOR\n\n\xc2\xb0L\n\nTE MPERATURE\n\nOI\nSENORHEAT\n\nX\n--I J J < F AU T\nI\n>L\n\nHEADER\n\n}\n\'"EXHAUST\n\n-CATALYST,\nVALVE\'\nEXADAMPER\n\nERCMNT\n\nENGINEr\nTHERMOSTATIC\n\n5T\n\n[\nI\n\nCONTROL\nJVALVE\n\nm-MANIFLDfOPN\\\n\nHOT SPOT\n\nWHEN\n\nT< 8\nEGN\nBLC\n\nOLN\n\nMANIFOLD\n\niCONTROLLANT\n\n\nTEuMPERAdfiTURdEar\n\nCONTROLLED\nLEAK\n\nHEATING ELEMENTVAE\n\nWTH\n\nCATAL\' S1\nE X\n\nAIR\n\nIAIR\nCONTROL\nVALVE\nN\nMAIT TAINSTT\n\nAROUND EXHAUST\nMANIFOLD\n\nUNDER-HOOD\n\nI\n\nyse\n\nfr6Cyide\n\n97\n\nlyot\n\nIn the baseline system, an EGR delay solenoid is energized by the starter\n\nsolenoid and closes the line between the intake manifold and the vacuum ampli\xc2\xad\nfier., A time delay switch deactivates the EGR delay solenoid after about\n\n30 seconds of engine operation. When the delay solenoid is deactivated, mani\xc2\xad\nfold pressure is supplied to the vacuum amplifier which in turn provides a\n\ncontrol signal to the EGR valve.\n\nFour tests were made to examine the effect of the EGR delay time on\n\ncold-start emissions. In the urban driving cycle, the engine remains at\n\nidle for about 20 seconds before accelerating up the first ramp of the cycle.\n\nThe stock time delay of about 30 seconds permits the vehicle to start the\n\nfirst acceleration ramp without EGR. This helps minimize any driveability\n\nproblems during this initial acceleration and also provides some engine\n\nwarm-up before starting EGR flow. EGR flow is needed before any heavy accel\xc2\xad\nerations to help control NO, emissions. The sensitivity tests covered delay\n\ntimes from 30 seconds to 120 seconds.\n\nResults of the sensitivity tests are given in Table 8. Emissions are\n\nexpressed in grams per phase. Comparisons of the total HC and CO emissions\n\nfor-the cold transient portion of the urban driving cycle (first 505 seconds)\n\nare given in Figure 27. Two sets of baseline data are provided for comparison\n\nwith the results for the modified control strategies. The vehicle baseline\n\ndata represents an average of the data from three full urban driving cycle\n\ntests made at the Subaru test facility. The second baseline shown is a\n\nresult of testing the stock engine/transmission at JPL on the eddy current\n\n(EC) dynamometer at the time the sensitivity tests were being made. The\n\nresults indicate little or no improvement in cold-start emissions with an\n\nincrease in EGR delay time. Indeed, the 90- and 120-second delay times\n\nresult in higher HC and CO emissions than the stock baseline. For the 60\xc2\xad\nsecond delay time, HC emissions are slightly lower than the baseline values,\n\nbut CO emissions are higher. The data from these tests does not support any\n\nchange in the stock EGR delay time.\n\nContinuous mode data was taken during the driving cycle tests to aid in\n\nunderstanding system operation. Some samples of this data are presented here.\n\nAll plots show data for the first 130 seconds of the driving cycle since this\n\nperiod is of prime interest for cold-start emissions. The vehicle speed trace\n\nis shown in Figure 28. Time starts when the engine is cranked. Note the\n\n20-second idle time before accelerating up the first ramp.\n\nComparison plots are shown for the tests with EGR delay times of 30,\n\n90, and 120 seconds. The control pressure for the EGR valve is shown in\n\nFigure 29. This parameter remains at zero until the time delay switch\n\ndeactivates the EGR delay solenoid to start EGR operation. This plot shows\n\nthat the proper EGR switching was accomplished in these tests. Choke opera\xc2\xad\ntion is shown in Figure 30. The 80 percent position for the choke corres\xc2\xad\nponds to the wide-open choke case. The choke was removed after the first\n\n90 seconds of the run in all, three tesets.. The testdatatQor the EGR.delay time\n\nof 90 seconds indicates more choking of the engine during the first 20-30 sec\xc2\xad\nonds of the test\nThis would tend to aggravate the HC emissions problem\n\nfor this test and could be one of the reasons for the higher HC emissions in\n\nbag 1 as shown in Table 8. The catalyst bed temperature is given in Figure 31.\n\nThe catalyst bed temperature reaches its operating temperature faster for the\n\nstock EGR delay time. This factor acts to negate any decrease in HC emissions\n\n41\n\n\n1 \xc2\xad BASELINE - SUBARU\nAVERAGE\n\n3 -\n\nBASELINE - JPL\nEC DYNO\n60 s EGR DELAY\n\n4-\n\n90 s EGR DELAY\n\n5-\n\n120 sEGR DELAY\n\n2-\n\n6\n-5\n\n004\n\n3\n2\n\n140II\n120\n\no3\n\n4\n\n5\\\',\n\n100\n\n.960\n40\xc2\xad\n20\n\nFigure 27.\n\nEffect of FOR Shut-Off on Cold-Start Emissions\n\n\n42\n\n\nrl SET\n\n2 Y476 148\n\nN\n\n2.\n\n0\n\n...\n\n.\n\n.... . .... . ... . . .....\n\nTIME\n\nFigure 28.\n\n... ..\n\nSECONDS\n\n\nVehicle Speed Versus Time For Urban Driving Cycle\n\n1111111\n\nFI SET\n\n3 Y475 148\n\n2.\n\nz\n0\nU\n\n0\n\nri SET\n\n2 Y473 147\n\nF\nIn\n\n0.\n\n0.\n\n...\n\n\'\n\n*,T\n\nFiur\n\n29\n\n_oto\n\niresue\nio-EG-Vl\xc2\xad\n\nrl\n\nSET\n\n3\n\nY475\n\n148i\n\nI\n\n0.\n0\n\n1.2\n\nLIn\n\nIJ .\'4\n\nI\n\nI\n\n__\n\n_\n\n_\n\nI\n\n. ..\n\n.\n\n.\n\nC/\n\nLI\n\n.4\n\n12\n\nFI\n\nSET\' 2\n\nY476 14J\n\n12\n\n..... . .\n\n.. . . . ... . .\n\n. .. .\n\nTIME\n\nFigure 30.\n\nSECONDS\n\nChoke Characteristics\n\n0\n\n1\n\n-\n\niLLJ\n\n-5--\n\n___\n\nwi\n\n___\n\nOOOL/J-dW3i 038-LUJ ISflHX3\n\nI\n\n-o\n\nF-\n\nA\n\nI\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\ni**9\n\n*)\n\nE\n\n000I/J-dWfll 038-ILun lSfbHX3\n\n46\n\nJJi\n\n--\n\nI-\xc2\xad\n\n0OL/.A1-d1421 038-lUn ISflWHXJ\n\n0 pW\'yMM\n\n".06\n\n*0,\n\n-of\n\n2L\n\nL\n\n4a\n\n4\xc2\xad\n\nTable 8.\n\nDay\n\nTape\n\n6148\n\nY476 \tg/bag\n\'g/bag\ng/bag\nTOTAL\n\n6147\n\nCold-Start Emissions Tests: EGR Shut-Off Results\n\nfor Cold 505 Federal Urban Driving Cycle\n\n\nPhase\n\nNOx(g)\n\nCO(g)\n\n1\n2\n3\ng/bag\n\n0.54\n1.92\n0.94\n3.4\n\n55.95\n22.38\n1.42\n79.75\n\n3.60 Stock system.

After\n\nleaving the carburetor, the fuel-air mixture is directed vertically downward\n\ninto the intake manifold. The flow then impinges directly on the hot spot in\n\nthe floor of the manifold, turns 90 degrees and then flows through the mani\xc2\xad\nfold runners into the cylinders. The hot spot area of the intake manifold is\n\nheated from below by exhaust gases. A thermostatically-controlled heat con\xc2\xad\ntrol valve in the exhaust manifold directs hot exhaust gases to the hot spot\n\narea during engine warm-up operation.\n\nWith a cold engine, it is necessary to provide an adequate gasoline\n\nvapor/air ratio to the cylinders for good engine operation. Because of liquid\n\ncondensation on the cold walls of the intake manifold, this vapor/air ratio\n\nmay be c6nsiderably less than the fuel/air ratio of the mixture leaving the\n\ncarburetor. With the stock hot spot region, it is still necessary to apply\n\nthe choke with a cold engine to provide an adequate vapor/air ratio for the\n\nengine. The choke causes a much richer gasoline/air mixture to be produced by\n\nthe carburetor. Changes in choke control strategy must be considered jointly\n\nwith improvements in the effectiveness of the intake manifold hot spot.\n\n\n47\n\n\n,"F T-r- -- I-.. ...\n\xc2\xad\nr\n\n4..\n\n.. .. . .\n\n..--.-.\n\n.\n\n. .. ..\n\n.\n\n.\n\n\nsn3 Y475 148\n\n--.\n\n..\n\n.\n\n.\n\n...\n\n..\n\n.\n\n...\n\n4.\n\nlSET\n\n000\n\n2 Y473\n\n147\n\nU\'\n\n0(\n\nI,\n\n\n~2.\n\n111,1_6111 ....\n-,\n.\n\nag\n\n..\n\n..... _...\n\xc2\xadq \\\n\nkJ\n\n-to, \n\nz\n\nI-i\n\nSET\n\n.,\n2 Y473\n\n,[llllIIIIIIll[\n\n14N\nI111 \nHll[\n\nI\n~~lFIllI~llliiiiiiHItllltI \n\nlllHIHll\n\nF\n\n.\n\n-\n\n...\n\n........--\n\ni~t\n\n111111\nI FtUI1\n\nFiue.2\n\nHdo-ro\n\n--\n\n\n/11uill\nll ...... ...\n.....\n\nEmsinCarceitc\n\n\nI\n\nm ud[111\n\n\'\xc2\xad\n\n-\n\nll \nI111\n\n1111\n\nII\n\n111HIIIil\n\nIlllli~ll\n\n\nThree tests were made to determine the effect of an improved hot spot on\n\ncold-start emissions. To supplement the stock hot spot system, a coil of elec\xc2\xad\ntrical resistance wire was placed near the floor of the intake manifold over\n\nthe hot spot area. Electrical leads were brought out through the carburetor\n\nmounting flange to be hooked up to the electrical power supply. Temperature of\n\nthe electrical coil was monitored by a thermocouple in contact with the coil.\n\nOnce the coil temperature reached 2000 F, the control circuit adjusted the\n\nelectrical power to maintain this temperature throughout the test.\n\nThe results for the three tests are given in Table 9. Emissions are\n\nexpressed in grams per phase. Comparisons of the HC and CO emissions for the\n\ncold transient part of the urban driving cycle are given in Figure 33. Again\n\ntwo sets of baseline data are shown for comparison:\nthe vehicle results from\n\nthe tests at the Subaru facility and the JPL engine/transmission results from\n\nthe EC dynamometer. In each of the tests with the modified configuration using\n\nthe electrically heated coil, the coil temperature reached the 200OF set-point\n\nafter about 210 seconds into the driving cycle run. These two tests were\n\ndifferent in that one used the stock choke control-strategy and the other used\n\nno choke. The emissions results for the stock choke case were not better than\n\nthe baseline results, with the CO emissions being somewhat worse. The stock\n\nchoke strategy - which results in a richer vapor/air mixture being supplied to\n\nthe engine - probably offset any improvement in fuel vaporization. The\n\nemissions results for the same modified configuration with no choke are con\xc2\xad\nsiderably better. Both HC and CO emissions are reduced; however, vehicle\n\ndriveability was less acceptable. To achieve the best results, it would be\n\nnecessary to tailor the choke control strategy to provide adequate vehicle\n\ndriveability and minimize system interaction problems.\n\nContinuous mode data was taken for the tests with the electrically\xc2\xad\nheated hot spot. Comparative choke position data are given in Figure 34. In\n\nthe third test (Tape W746) the choke was held open manually after the first\n\n30 seconds of the test. This permitted the choke to operate normally until\n\nthe vehicle had successfully started up the first acceleration ramp. For this\n\n-test, the wide-open choke corresponds to 100 percent choke position. In the\n\nother two tests, the wide-open choke is achieved with an 80 percent choke\n\nposition. In the second test (Tape W745), more choking is used than in the\n\nstock case, and it remains in effect longer.\n\nCatalyst bed temperatures are shown plotted in Figure 35. The data\n\nindicate that the catalyst warm-up was at least as fast in the tests with the\n\nelectrically-heated hot spot tests as in those with the stock system. Hydro\xc2\xad\ncarbon emissions profiles are given in Figure 36. There is a delay of about\n\n10-12 seconds in the continuous mode emissions trace for flow time and system\n\nresponse time. This delay is a result of the length of the sample lines\n\nbetween the engine exhaust system and the emissions instruments.\n\nSTART CATALYST\n\nThe stock baseline emission control system has an oxidizing catalyst for\n\nthe conversion of HC and CO emissions from the engine. As is shown in Sec\xc2\xad\ntion II, the stock catalyst unit achieves high conversion efficiencies for\n\nboth HC and CO under warmed-up conditions.

The standard catalyst unit could be located\n\ncloser to the exhaust manifold for a faster warm-up. The closer location\n\nwould lead to higher peak temperatures in the catalyst bed and reduced cata\xc2\xad\nlyst activity. An alternative technique for reducing catalyst warm-up time\n\nis to provide supplemental heating of the catalyst bed for faster activation.\n\nThe use of an electrically heated element for this purpose is discussed in the\n\nnext section. Another method is the addition of a cold-start catalyst (CSC)\n\nunit in addition to the standard catalyst unit. The CSC unit would be used\n\nonly during engine warm-up operation.\n\nA series of tests was performed using a separate CSC unit mounted as\n\nshown in Figure 37. Flow through the CSC unit was regulated by a damper valve.\n\nThe configuration was designed to keep the distance between the exhaust mani\xc2\xad\nfold and the standard catalyst unit the same as in the stock vehicle. This\n\ninsured that the standard catalyst would not overheat during engine operation.\n\nThe standard catalyst unit has two monolith elements (oval cross-section) with\n\na platinum/palladium (Pt/Pd) ratio of 2/1 and a total precious metal loading\n\nof 25 g/ft 3 . The catalyst material is mounted on a cordierite base. The CSC\n\nunit was mounted closer to the exhaust manifold, for faster warm-up. The CSC\n\nunit contained one monolith element (circular cross-section). Tests were\n\nmade with both the standard catalyst material and a more active oxidation\n\ncatalyst with a Pt/Pd ratio of 1/1 and a total precious metal loading of\n\n165 g/ft 3 mounted on a cordierite base.

Emissions are\n\nexpressed in grams per phase. Comparisons of the HC and CO emisisons for the\n\ncold transient portion of the urban driving cycle are given in Figure 38.\n\nAgain two sets of baseline data are shown for comparison: the vehicle results\n\nfrom the tests at the Subaru facility and the JPL engine/transmission results\n\nfrom the EC dynamometer. The baseline test on the EC dynamometer was made\n\nwith the modified exhaust configuration; however, the damper valve was set to\n\nbypass the CSC unit for the entire test.\n\nIn each of the tests with the CSC unit, exhaust gas flow was directed\n\nthrough the CSC unit until the catalyst bed temperature reached 800-850OF;\n\nthe diverter valve was then switched to bypass the CSC unit for the remainder\n\nof the test. In the first CSC test, standard catalyst material was used;\n\nhowever, a more active catalyst material was used in the second test. The\n\ntest results show some nominal reduction of HC and CO emissions when compared\n\nwith the EC dynamometer baseline. In the configuration tested, the standard\n\ncatalyst unit had not reached its light-off temperature when the diverter\n\nvalve was switched to bypass the CSC unit at about 50 seconds into the test.\n\nSUPPLEMENTAL HEATING OF CATALYST UNIT\n\nThe HC and CO conversion efficiencies of the standard catalyst unit are\n\nnot good until the catalyst bed reaches.its light-off temperature (about\n\n500-6000 F). The addition of some supplemental heating to the catalyst unit\n\nshould reduce this warm-up time. The hardware used in evaluating the supple\xc2\xad\nmental heating technique consisted of a standard catalyst unit which had been\n\nmodified to accept an electrically-heated element as shown in Figure 39.\n\nThe standard catalyst unit was lengthened 1 inch to accommodate the\n\nheater element. The heated element was a silicon carbide monolith with a\n\nPt/Pd ratio of 1/1 and a total precious metal loading of 56 g/ft 3 . The ele\xc2\xad\nment was oval in cross-section with a 1-inch thickness. To provide better\n\nheating of the entire catalyst unit, the heater element was located upstream\n\nof the two standard monolith elements. Two flat rectangular electrodes were\n\nplaced on the flat sides of the heater element to provide the maximum flow\xc2\xad\npath for electrical current flow. The element, with electrodes, was wrapped\n\nfirst with fibrefrax insulation and then with stainless wire mesh. The ele\xc2\xad\nment was then placed in the extended catalyst container. Electrical leads\n\nwere run from the electrodes, through insulated openings in the container,\n\nand to the electrical power supply.\n\nTests of the electrically-heated catalyst unit were not made on the EC\n\ndynamometer. This modification was included as a part of the final series of\n\nvehicle tests.

The amount of NO, emissions\n\nformed is also dependent on the concentrations of oxygen and nitrogen avail\xc2\xad\nable for reaction. To suppress the formation of oxides of nitrogen in the\n\ncombustion chamber, several techniques have been used, including spark retard\n\nand the addition of diluents to the intake mixture. Recently, considerable\n\nsuccess in controlling NO x emissions has been achieved using three-way\n\ncatalyst systems for exhaust aftertreatment (Refs. 32, 33, 34).\n\nThe addition of diluents to the incoming fuel/air mixture helps to\n\nreduce NOx emissions by absorbing some of the energy released by the combus\xc2\xad\ntion process. This decreases peak temperatures and reduces the time when\n\nconditions are favorable for NOx formation. The desirable properties of such\n\na diluent are nonreactivity, relative to the intake mixture, and a high heat\n\ncapacity (Refs. 29, 35).\nExhaust gases, water, and excess air have all been\n\nstudied as possible charge diluents. Injecting water, usually in the intake\n\nport, is undesirable because it requires a storage tank and care must be taken\n\nto prevent freezing in cold environments. The use of excess air reduces\n\ncylinder temperatures and is the basis of the lean burn concept which has-been\n\nstudied elsewhere (Ref. 36) and will not be discussed here.\n\nExhaust gas recirculation (EGR) has been widely used for NOx emissions\n\ncontrol since exhaust gases are readily available, EGR is relatively simple to\n\nimplement, and EGR is an effective controller of NO x emissions (Ref. 37).\n\nLarge reductions of NOx emissions can be achieved with small amounts of EGR.\n\nHowever, EGR influences other engine characteristics such as HC emissions,\n\nvehicle driveability, and fuel economy. The EGR installation and control\n\nstrategy must provide the proper balance among these important factors.\n\nRecirculated exhaust gases act to suppress NOx emissions by diluting the\n\nintake mixture. When in the combustion chamber, the EGR absorbs some of the\n\nenergy released during combustion and thus limits peak temperatures. This\n\nreduction in peak temperature affects other areas of engine operation. When\n\nengine power and spark advance are held fixed, an increase in EGR results in\n\nan increase in fuel consumption since combustion is slowed and extends further\n\ninto the expansion portion of the cycle. Gumbleton (Ref. 38) 1as shown that\n\nwith proper engine adjustments the use of EGR can result in a reduction in\n\nfuel consumption.\n\nThe use of EGR has an adverse effect on HC emissions. This results\n\npartially from the decreased temperature in the combustion chamber, which\n\nleads to larger quench zones and more unburned hydrocarbons. This effect has\n\nbeen demonstrated in vehicle tests by Gumbleton (Ref:.38). For large\n\namounts of EGR, hydrocarbon emissions show a steep rise as the combusion\n\nprocess begins to degrade. This point coincides with a significant reduction\n\n\n60\n\n\nin vehicle driveability. Thus, there are definite limits on the amount of\n\nEGR that can be used to control NOx emission without sacrificing HC emission\n\ncontrol and driveability.\n\nVarious techniques have been used to implement the recirculation of\n\nexhaust gases. Freedman and Nicholson (Ref. 39) discuss the control of EGR\n\nthrough valve timing. In their work, exhaust gas residuals were increased\n\nthrough the use of increased valve overlap and a variable cam timing mechanism.\n\nAs improved control of EGR was needed, new EGR systems with the capability\n\nfor more accurately metering EGR flow rate were developed. Thompson (Ref. 40)\n\ndescribes the development of the EGR system for Buick.\n\nMany EGR control schemes have been investigated. The system on the\n\nPlymouth baseline vehicle for this study uses an EGR valve, controlled by a\n\nvacuum amplifier, to meter exhaust gases through an external flow passage from\n\nthe exhaust manifold to the intake manifold. This approach is discussed in\n\nmore detail in Section II. Other designs have incorporated the EGR valve in\n\nthe intake manifold to connect the exhaust crossover flow passage with the\n\nintake plenum. The use of microprocessors on engines will permit more com\xc2\xad\nplex control algorithms to be implemented. EGR valves, and thus EGR flow,\n\ncan be controlled as specified functions of intake manifold pressure, exhaust\n\nmanifold pressure, engine RPM, etc.\n\nTEST SETUP DESCRIPTION\n\nConsiderable success has been achieved through the use of exhaust gas\n\nrecirculation (EGR) as a means for controlling nitrogen oxide (No.) emissions.\n\nThe EGR tests on this project were structured to provide insight into the\n\nrelationship between fuel economy and emission for the EGR emission control\n\napproach. Since some combination of EGR and spark advance control is gen\xc2\xad\nerally used for control of NOx emissions, a series of sensitivity tests were\n\nmade while varying both EGR flow rate and spark advance. The sensitivity\n\ntests were made at steady-state operating conditions on a water brake\n\ndynamometer.\n\nTo facilitate the engine testing, the stock controls for both EGR and\n\nspark advance were made inoperative. With both the vacuum and centrifugal\n\nadvance mechanisms of the distributor not operating, the spark advance was\n\nadjusted by mechanically moving the distributor with a pneumatic actuator.\n\nThe vacuum supply to the EGR valve was disconnected and the poppet in the EGR\n\nvalve was positioned mechanically using a pneumatic actuator. EGR flow rate\n\nwas calculated using air calibration data from cold-flow bench tests of the\n\nEGR valve. All cold-start emissions devices and the air injection reactor\n\n(AIR) system were operating in the stock manner during the sensitivity tests.\n\nSince all of the sensitivity tests were run with the engine in a fully\n\nwarmed-up condition, the cold-start emissions devices should have had no\n\ninfluence on the test results. The stock AIR system had an effect on the\n\nresults since it determined the excess air available for HC and CO conver\xc2\xad\nsions in the catalytic converter.\n\n\n61\n\n\nSENSITIVITY TESTS\n\nEleven engine operating conditions were selected for evaluation in the\n\nEGR/spark advance sensitivity tests. The test conditions were selected to\n\ngive adequate coverage of the region used most frequently when driving the\n\nurban driving cycle. This is appropriate for developing an EGR/spark advance\n\ncontrol strategy since vehicle emissions results are determined from the urban\n\ndriving cycle test. The selected test conditions are shown in Figure 40.\n\nMeasurements of fuel consumption and HC, CO, and NO, emissions were taken\n\nfor each operating condition. Exhaust emissions were measured both upstream\n\nand downstream of the oxidation catalyst. Engine equivalence ratio and AIR\n\nflow rate were used to determine the excess air available in the oxidation\n\ncatalyst.\n\nTo simplify the presentation of material and the discussion of the\n\nresults, detailed results for only one engine operating condition are presented\n\nin he main body of this report. The operating condition chosen is 2000 RPM\n\nand 40 BMEP which is typical for level-road-load conditions at about 50 MPH.\n\nSimilar data and plots for the remaining engine conditions are included in\n\nAppendix D. In all plots, comparisons are made with the stock engine results\n\npreviously discussed. A summary of the sensitivity data is given in Table 11.\n\nThe effect of EGR and spark advance on the brake specific fuel consump-\xc2\xad\ntion is\' shown in Figure 41.

The\n\ncurves show that BSFC decreases to a minimum as the spark advance is increased\n\nto the MBT value. For this particular engine operating condition, the minimum\n\nBSFC is achieved with about 12 percent EGR. To include the effect of EGR,\n\nthe following effective equivalence ratio can be defined.\n\n\nM\n*E\n\nwhere \t\n\n(\'A\n=\n\n+g\n\nGR)\n\ns\n\nE\n\n=\n\neffective equivalence ratio\n\n\nG\n\n=\n\ngasoline flow rate\n\nprimary air flow rate\n\n\nMA\n11\n\nGR\n\n=\n\nEGR flow rate\n\n=\n\nstoichiometric fuel-to-air ratio\n\n4 ORI\n64\n\nO\n\nAL\n\nO \t POOR QUA_.fI\ny\nT\n\nThus, the minimum BSFC occurs at an effective equivalence ratio of about 0.8.\n\nThis result is consistent with the fact that the most efficient lean operating\n\ncondition in a typical conventional engine occurs at equivalence ratios between\n\n0.8 and 0.85.\n\nThe effect of EGR and spark advance on the brake specific NO x (BSNOx)\n\nemissions is shown in Figure 42. For a given EGR flow rate, increasing the\n\nspark advance results in an increase in NOx emissions. EGR is seen to be a\n\nvery effective means for reducing NOx emissions. This effect is shown clearly\n\nin Figure 43 where NO x emissions are plotted versus effective equivalence\n\nratio.\n\nThe trade-off between BSFC and BSNOx emission for this operating condi\xc2\xad\ntion is illustrated in Figure 44. For a given EGR flow rate, an increase in\n\nspark advance, up to the MBT value, results in a decrease in fuel consumption;\n\nhowever, this improvement in engine efficiency is accompanied by an increase\n\nin NOx emissions. The characteristics are similar for each of the EGR flow\n\nrates tested. Comparisons with the stock data for this operating condition\n\nindicated that substantial reductions in fuel consumption could be achieved at\n\nthe expense of higher NOx emissions.\n\nThe relationship between BSHC emissions and BSNOx emission is shown in\n\nFigure 45. The emissions data plotted here are based on exhaust samples\n\ntaken downstream of the oxidation catalyst. Dashed lines are drawn through\n\nconditions yielding the same specific fuel consumption. For each EGR\'flow\n\nrate, the data points with MBT spark timing are shown with solid symbols. For\n\nMBT spark timing, increases in EGR flow rate result in less NO x emissions;\n\nhowever, HC emissions increase substantially. Within the range of this data,\n\nretarding the spark timing from its MBT value reduces both NOx and HC emis\xc2\xad\nsions; however, fuel consumption is increased. Comparisons with the stock\n\ndata indicate that large reductions in HC emissions could be achieved with the\n\nsame fuel consumption and only slightly increased NO x emissions for this\n\noperating condition.\n\nThe increase in HC emissions with increasing EGR flow rate could be the\n\nresult of either an increase in HC emissions from the engine or a decrease in\n\nHC conversion efficiency in the catalytic converter. For all the data shown,\n\nthe average HC conversion efficiency is 85 percent and the average CO conver\xc2\xad\nsion efficiency is 95 percent. These values are about equal to the conversion\n\nefficiencies for the stock data points for this operating condition. For high\n\nconversion efficiencies, the catalytic converter must have an excess of air\n\n0\nand an adequate operating temperature (-800 F.).\nThe engine equivalence ratio\n\nfor this data is less than stoichiometric (-O0.95)\nindicating than an excess\n\nof oxygenis available for the catalytic converter. Additional air is intro\xc2\xad\nduced by the AIR system.

Data from the EGR/spark advance sensitivity\n\ntests described in the previous section were used to establish the control\n\nstrategies. For each strategy, one data point was selected for each of the\n\n10 engine operating conditions used in the sensitivity tests. These 10 data\n\npoints were used as a basis for developing the control functions needed to\n\nimplement the Strategies. A total of 8 strategies were developed and tested.\n\nThe data points used as a basis for these 8 control strategies are given in\n\nTable 12.\n\nThe general approach was to first run a case with zero EGR flow rate and\n\nMBT spark timing (Strategy No. 1).\nThis was followed by several cases where\n\nthe data points were selected to bring the NOx emissions down to a level\n\ncomparable to the stock vehicle while minimizing the adverse effects on fuel\n\nconsumption and HC emissions (Strategies Nos. 2, 3, and 4). Test results for\n\neach strategy were examined before proceeding to the next case. Since imple\xc2\xad\nmentation of the strategies was not always done as accurately as desired,\n\nseveral alternative functional representations of one set of data were examined\n\nto see which approach gave the best.results (Strategies Nos. 5, 6, 7, and 8).\n\nIt was decided that EGR flow rate and spark advance would be made a\n\nfunction of engine RPM, manifold pressure, and exhaust pressure since these\n\nparameters could be easily used as inputs to the control module. Strategy\n\nNo. 6 will be used for discussion in this part of the report; information on\n\nthe other strategies is included in Appendix E.\n\nThe data points which were used as a basis for Strategy No. 6 are given\n\nin Table 13. The position of the poppet in the EGR valve is expressed in\n\npercent of full travel. The EGR poppet position is shown plotted as a func\xc2\xad\ntion of exhaust pressure in Figure 47.

The Integrated Data Acquisition Control (IDAC) system, which\n\nnormally handles the data processing and storage for the automotive test\n\nfacility, provided the required analog voltage to the control system logic.\n\nThe mathematical models were implemented primarily by means of standard\n\nplug-in analog modules manufactured by Moore Industries. These standard\n\nmodules, which conveniently interface with each other, were capable of repre\xc2\xad\nsenting the majority of the required mathematical functions. By utilizing\n\nseveral of these standard modules as a group and supplementing them with a\n\nfew custom modules, an electronic analog of the various EGR/spark advance\n\nmathematical models was developed.

This module provides two functions. First,\n\nit re-ranges the signal to a nominal 1-5 volt range, providing compatibility\n\nwith the balance of the logic elements. Secondly, it provides a means for\n\nboth gain and offset adjustments through resettable controls, thus allowing\n\nthe slope and Y-axis intercept for the up-ramp to be adjusted. Module gain\n\nis adjusted to provide: A(spark advance, degrees) = A (Pmanifold, psia)/10.\n\nModule offset is adjusted to yield a spark advance of -50 degrees for a\n\nmanifold pressure of 0 psia.\n\nOutput from the Voltage Interface Module (V2) interfaces with the\n\nHigh Select Amplitude Discriminator Module and the Inverse Output Voltage\n\nModule. The High Select Amplitude Discriminator Module provides a reset\xc2\xad\ntable adjustment of the lower limit for spark advance, i.e., an adjustment\n\nfor constant spark advance at values of manifold pressure less than a specific\n\nvalue. This module, after comparing the input voltages V2 and V3 (an adjust\xc2\xad\nable reference voltage), selects the higher of the two, and provides an\n\noutput voltage (V4) proportional to the selected input. In operation, as the\n\nmanifold pressure drops, V2 will also drop, but V3 will remain constant since\n\nit is fixed at a level corresponding to the selected lower limit spark\n\nadvance. Output voltage V4-will track V2 until V2 falls below V3, at which\n\ntime V4 will be set equal to V3 and will remain at this value until V2 exceeds\n\nV3. This module thus provides a lower limit on V4 which is set to correspond\n\nto a spark Advance of 20 degrees for this strategy.\n\nThe output from the Voltage Interface Module (V2) is also supplied to\n\nthe Inverse Output Voltage Module. This module generates the negative slope\n\nportion of the spark advance curve.

Module offset is\n\nadjusted to yield a spark advance of 96 degrees for a manifold pressure of\n\n0 psia.\n\n.\n\nOutput from this module (V7) is compared with V6 in the Second Low Dis\xc2\xad\ncriminator Module. This module provides the transfer from upper limit on\nspark advance to the negative-sloping segment of the spark advance curve gen\xc2\xad\nerated by the Inverse Output Voltage Module. In operation, as the manifold\npressure increases, the output from the Inverse Output Voltage Module (V7)\ndecreases. At the same time, the output from first Low Select Discriminator\n\nModule (V6)\n\nis set at a value corresponding to V5.\n\nOutput from this module\n\n(V8) will track lower of the two values of V6 or V7. This provides the nega\xc2\xad\ntive sloping portion of the curve for this spark advance strategy. This output\n\nvoltage (V8) is converted to a proportional output current by the Current\n\nDriver Module. This module converts the nominal 1-5 volt signal to a 4-20\n\nmilliampere signal to provide the required compatibility with the balance of\n\n\nthe system.\n\nMechanical actuation of the distributor is the final link to spark\n\nadvance control of the engine. This actuation is accomplished with a pneu\xc2\xad\nmatic positioning actuator, whose position output is proportional to a varying\n\npneumatic pressure, nominally 3-15 psi. This varying pressure is generated bya\n\nelectropneumatic pressure transducer whose output pressure excursions are\n\nproportional to input signal variations.\n\n\n77\n\n\nEGR Controls\n\nA detailed description of the operation of the control system for\n\nimplementing the EGR strategies will not be included here since it is very\n\nsimilar to the spark advance discussion of the previous section. In the case\n\nof the EGR system, the pneumatic actuator positions the poppet in the EGR valve\n\nto control the EGR flow rate as a prescribed function of measured engine\n\nexhaust pressure.\n\nDRIVING CYCLE TEST RESULTS\n\nUsing the implementation methods discussed in the previous section,\n\nFederal urban driving cycle tests were made using the eight EGR/spark advance\n\nstrategies selected. The tests were conducted with the engine and automatic\n\ntransmission mounted on the EC dynamometer stand as shown in Figure 51. The\n\nroad load horsepower requirements for the driving cycle were electrically fed\n\ninto the EC dynamometer control circuits. Inertia loads were simulated by\n\nattaching appropriate rotating weights to the output shaft of the dynamometer.\n\nInertia wheels were added until the 0-60 MPH acceleration time matched the\n\nstock vehicle values.\n\n\nFigure 51.\n\nEddy Current (EC) Dynamometer Test Setup\n\n78 \t\n\nORIINAL PAGE IS\n\nOF POORt QJAIXfy\n\nThe complete cold-start 1975 Federal Test Procedure (FTP) was used for\n\neach of the control strategy tests. Both Constant Volume Sample (CVS) and\n\ncontinuous mode emissions data was recorded. The cold-start emissions devices\n\nand the AIR pump were operated in their stock condition for these tests.\n\nResults of the EGR/spark advance strategy tests are given in Table 16\n\nalong with the stock test results. The trade-off between fuel economy and\n\nN0x emissions is illustrated in Figure 52. The best fuel economy was achieved\n\nusing Control Strategy No. 1 (zero EGR and MBT spark timing) which yielded\n\nabout 16 percent better NPG than the stock system. However, the NO, emissions\n\nfrom this strategy were very high, being about 4 times the stock value. At\n\nthe same NOx emissions level as the stock system, several strategies were\n\nable to show about 7-11 percent better fuel economy than stock. When HC\n\nemissions are considered, Control Strategy No. 6 appears to be best as shown\n\nin Figure 53. This strategy gave HC and NO x emissions levels equivalent to\n\nthe stock system and provided about 7 percent better fuel economy.\n\nSince the completion of this activity, considerable effort has been\n\ndirected toward determining an optimum engine calibration that maximizes fuel\n\neconomy over the urban driving cycle subject to a set of emissions constraints\n\n(Refs. 41, 42). Use of these new techniques greatly reduces the testing\n\nrequired to optimize an engine.\n\n\nTable 16.\n\nEGR/Spark Advance Control Strategy Tests\nFederal Urban Driving Cycle Results\n\nDay\n\nTape\n\nStrategy\n\nMPG\n\nNOx(g/mi)\n\nCO(g/mi)\n\nHC(g/mi)\n\n6146\n\nY468\n\nStock\n\n14.58\n\n0.80\n\n5.65\n\n1.02\n\n6113\n\nW667\n\n1\n\n16.97\n\n3.18\n\n11.12\n\n0M74\n\n6124\n\nY133\n\n2\n\n15.51\n\n1.32\n\n16.62\n\n1.32\n\n6126\n\nY136\n\n3\n\n15.28\n\n1.20\n\n20.48\n\n1.74\n\n6126\n\nY137\n\n4\n\n16.25\n\n1.00\n\n13.44\n\n2.08\n\n6127\n\nN921\n\n5\n\n15.65\n\n0.74\n\n14.80\n\n2.08\n\n6132\n\nN926\n\n6\n\n15.61\n\n0.81\n\n9.72\n\n1.06\n\n6133\n\nN927\n\n7\n\n14.48\n\n1.08\n\n6.21\n\n1.38\n\n6133\n\nN928\n\n8\n\n14.47\n\n1.09\n\n10.50\n\n1.17\n\n79\n\n\n~0\n\n17 \t\n4\n\n\n0\n\n16\n\n\n56\n\n\n0o\n\n2\n\n\n30\n\n0\n\n15\n\n0 7,8\n\n14\n\n\nI\n\n0.5 \t\n\n13 \n\n\nI\n1.5\n\n1.0\n\nI\n2.0\nNOx, g9/n\n\n\nI\n\n2.5\n\n3.0\n\n3.5\n\n\nFigure 52. \t Urban Driving Cycle Results for EGR/Spark\nAdvance Strategies - NO x Versus MPG\n2.5 \t\n\nI\n\nI\n\n5\n\n4\n\n\no\n\n2.0\n\n\nI\n\n\n0\n\n03\n\n\n1.5\n\n\n760\n\n\n1.0\n\n\n0\n\n\n0 \t\n0 \t\n\n.\n\n0.5\n\n[\n1.0\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\n3.0\n\nNOx, q/.;\n\nFigure 53. \t Urban Driving Cycle Results for EGR/Spark\n\nAdvance Strategies - NO, Versus HC\n\n\n80\n\n\n35\n\nSECTION V\n\nAIR EVALUATION\n\n\nBACKGROUND INFORMATION\n\nMany of the techniques used to control NO, emissions aggravate the HC/\n\nCO emissions problem. When primary combustion is carried out under rich con\xc2\xad\nditions (p>l), considerable HC and CO are present in the exhaust due to a lack\n\nof sufficient oxygen to complete the oxidation reactions. Also, the use of\n\nlarge quantities of EGR tends to result in more HC emissions in the exhaust.\n\nTechniques commonly used to control HC/CO emissions from the engine are thermal\n\nreactors and catalytic converters. In either case, it is necessary that\n\nsufficient oxygen be present in the exhaust for the oxidation reactions to go\n\nto completion. This excess oxygen can be achieved by running the engine lean\n\n(q<i) or by supplying additional air to the exhaust stream from the engine.\n\nThe system used to provide additional air to the exhaust is called an air\n\ninjection reactor (AIR) system.\n\nMuch of the early work on AIR systems was directed toward its use with\n\nthermal reactors rather than catalytic converters. In this case, developing\n\nan AIR system for an engine requires some tailoring of the reactivity and con\xc2\xad\ncentration of the exhaust species. The species\' reactivities and concentra\xc2\xad\ntions are important since both affect the conversion rate of HC and CO.\n\nThe composition of the exhaust stream, including HC and CO, varies con\xc2\xad\nsiderably under different engine operating conditions. In particular, HC\n\nemissions levels are a function of air-to-fuel ratio, mixture uniformity,\n\nengine load, surface-to-volume ratio of combustion chamber, spark advance, and\n\nengine operating temperatures. CO emissions are primarily a function of air\xc2\xad\nto-fuel ratio. Since both HC and CO emissions increase with engine speed, it\n\nwould be desirable to match air injection with engine RPM.\n\nIt would require a complex control scheme to adequately match AIR flow\n\nto the emissions concentration in the exhaust; however, it is not clear that\n\nsuch a complex system is desirable. The fact that HC and CO are both reducing\n\nagents is probably one of the few things they have in common. They are\n\ndifferent chemically, and they occur at different stages of the combustion\n\nreaction. Brownson and Stebar (Ref. 43), in their research aimed at determin\xc2\xad\ning the optimum injection rates, found that the best AIR flow is not the same\n\nfqr HC and CO. The AIR flow requirements for optimum HC and CO reduction\n\nwere the same for air-to-fuel ratios between 10 and 14.5; however, for air-to\xc2\xad\nfuel ratios leaner than 14.5, the CO requirement for AIR flow was 4 to 5 times\n\ngreater than the HC requirement. The abrupt change in AIR requirement for\n\noptimum CO reduction corresponded to a change in oxidation mechanism.\n\nLuminous oxidation was observed for air-to-fuel ratios richer than 14.5, while\n\nluminosity was not observed in leaner mixtures.\n\nThe reactivity of the species in the exhaust is another important influ\xc2\xad\nencing factor. Regardless of the excess air present, the HC and CO will not\n\noxidize if the reaction rates are too low. Perhaps the strongest effect on\n\nreactiod rates is exerted by the exhaust manifold temperature. Lower bulk\n\n\n81\n\n\ntemperatures lead to slower conversion rates. High conversion rates are\n\nimportant because the gases are in the exhaust pipe for a short time. In sys\xc2\xad\ntems with a catalytic converter, the residence time in the catalyst unit is\n\nimportant. Other factors which are important in this case include catalyst\n\nactivity, catalyst bed temperature, and exhaust concentrations.\n\nExhaust manifold volume and insulation have a strong influence on HC\n\nand CO emissions. Larger exhaust manifolds provide more residence time for\n\nthe exhaust gases to complete\'the oxidizing reactions. The addition of insula\xc2\xad\ntion to the exhaust system increases exhaust gas temperature, and this\n\nincreases the reactivity of the constituents.\n\nThe development of the General Motors AIR system is discussed by\n\nSteinhagen, et al. (Ref. 44) and Thompson (Ref. 45). These papers cover the\n\npractical aspects of making an AIR system work. The basic hardware needed for\n\nan AIR system are an air pump, a power supply for the pump, and plumbing to\n\ncarry the air from the pump to the exhaust port or manifold. Practical appli\xc2\xad\ncation of the AIR system has shown the need for several additional hardware\n\nelements. An air bleed valve is required to prevent backfiring during a\n\nsudden closing of the throttle. This solution keeps the engine firing at all\n\ntimes, and prevents excess fuel from igniting in the exhaust system. A pres\xc2\xad\nsure relief valve on the AIR pump is required to give good engine operation\n\nat high speeds and loads. The relief valve prevents high back pressures\n\nfrom developing due to the increased flow from the AIR pump and it also\n\nreduces exhaust system temperatures which can become too high with the rich\n\nmixtures needed for maximum power. A third feature needed in the AIR system\n\nis a check valve in the supply line from the pump to the exhaust manifold.\n\nThis prevents backflow into the AIR pump and supply line in the event of a\n\nfailure in the pump drive. In vehicles using an AIR pump, other engine\n\nchanges are normally made to improve the effectiveness in controlling exhaust\n\nemissions.\n\nAlternative methods of adding air to the exhaust gases have been studied\n\nOne such technique, called Pulsair (Ref. 46), uses the exhaust pressure fluc\xc2\xad\ntuations to induct the fresh air rather than an AIR pump. The advantages of\n\nthis approach are that it does not affect net engine power, and it is poten\xc2\xad\ntially less complex than \'the AIR pump system.\n\nVarious control techniques have been studied to more nearly optimize the\n\nair flow into the exhaust stream. Poyniak and Siewert (Ref. 47) studied a\n\ncontrol system-which tailored the air injection rate to the engine speed and\n\nload to produce a constant exhaust air-to-fuel ratio.\n\nUnder the proper conditions, air injection into the exhaust port or\n\nmanifold will oxidize a large amount of the HC and CO in the exhaust. The\n\neffectiveness of the AIR system in reducing emissions is greatly enhanced when\n\nused in conjunction with a thermal reactor or catalytic converter.\n\nTEST SETUP DEbuKniilON\n\nSome success in controlling HC and CO emissions has been achieved by\n\nusing an AIR system to provide additional air to the exhaust stream, especially\n\nin systems using a thermal reactor or catalytic converter. The baseline\n\n\n82\n\n\nvehicle for this activity has a catalytic converter to aid in controlling NC\n\nand CO emissions. The AIR tests on this project were structured to provide\n\ninformation about the relationship between emissions and the AIR emission con\xc2\xad\ntrol approach. A series of sensitivity tests were made while varying the flow\n\nrate from the AIR system. These tests were made at steady-state conditions\n\non a water brake dynamometer.\n\nFor the sensitivity tests, the EGR system, the spark advance, and all\n\ncold-start emissions devices were operated in a stock manner. Since all of\n\nthese tests were run with the engine in a fully warmed-up condition, the cold\xc2\xad\nstart emissions devices should have had no influence on the test results.\n\nRather than attempt to incorporate a variable speed drive for the AIR pump,\n\nfacility air was used to supply the air for injection into the exhaust system.\n\nTo keep approximately the same parasitic loss on the engine, the AIR pump\n\ncontinued to be driven by the engine during these tests. Air flow was meas\xc2\xad\nured using\'a laminar flow element, and then supplied to the stock hose leading\n\nto the AIR distribution manifold in the engine block.\n\nSENSITIVITY \t ESTS\n\nT\nEleven operating conditions were selected for evaluation in the AIR\n\nsensitivity tests. The test conditions were selected to give adequate cover\xc2\xad\nage of the region of the operating map which is most frequently used in driv\xc2\xad\ning the urban driving cycle. This is appropriate for developing an AIR con\xc2\xad\ntrol strategy since vehicle emissions results are based on the urban driving\n\ncycle test.

Exhaust emissions were measured\n\nboth upstream and downstream of the oxidation catalyst. Engine equivalence\n\nratio and AIR flow rate were used to determine the excess air available in the\n\noxidation catalyst.\n\nTo simplify the presentation of material and the discussion of the\n\nresults, detailed results for only two engine operating conditions are pre\xc2\xad\nsented in the main body of the report. These two conditions represent a case\n\nwhere the primary combustion is rich ( >l) and a case where the primary com\xc2\xad\nbustion is lean (4<).

The equivalence ratio for this test\n\ncondition is 0.90 indicating that about 10 percent excess air is available\n\nin the exhaust to promote further oxidation of HC and CO in the exhaust mani\xc2\xad\nfold or in the oxidation catalyst. HC emissions, both upstream and down\xc2\xad\nstream of the oxidation catalyst, are shown plotted versus percent AIR-in\n\nFigure 55. The catalyst is effective in reducing HC emissions for all AIR\n\nflow rates. This is a result of the lean calibration (p = 0.90) of the\n\nengine at this operating condition. Note that the minimum upstream HC emis\xc2\xad\nsions occur for about 6 percent AIR flow added to the exhaust. The corres\xc2\xad\nponding plot of CO emissions versus percent AIR is given in Figure 56.\n\nAgain the catalyst is effective in reducing CO emissions for all AIR flow\n\nrates. In this case, however, the minimum upstream CO emissions occur for\n\nabout 30 percent AIR flow. Thus, the AIR flow required to minimize upstream\n\nCO emissions is 5 times as large as the flow required to minimize upstream\n\nHC emissions. This result is consistent with the findings of Brownson and\n\nStebar (Ref. 43) for primary combustion leaner than stoichiometric. Average\n\nexhaust temperature-is shown in Figure 57. Exhaust temperature decreases\n\nas more AIR flow is added to the exhaust stream. For this engine operating\n\ncondition, the catalyst conversion efficiencies for HC and CO are very high\n\nand are essentially independent of AIR flow rate since all test points have\n\nexcess air.\n\nThe operating condition representing the rich primary combustion case\n\nis 1000 RPM and 30 BMEP. Sensitivity test results for this operating con\xc2\xad\ndition are given in Table 18. The equivalence ratio in this case is 1.04.\n\nHC emissions, both upstream and downstream of the catalytic converter, are\n\nshown plotted versus percent AIR in Figure 58. The catalyst becomes more\n\neffective at reducing HC emissions for AIR flows greater than 10 percent.\n\nNote that the minimum upstream HC emissions occur for about 30 percent AIR\n\nflow. A plot of CO emissions is given in Figure 59. Again the catalyst is\n\nmore effective for AIR flows greater than 10 percent. Minimum CO emissions\n\noccur for about 30 percent AIR flow, which is the AIR flow for minimum HC\n\nemissions. This result is again consistent with the findings of Brownson\n\nand Stebar (Ref. 43)-for primary combustion richer than stoichiometrie.\n\nHC and CO conversion efficiencies are shown plotted versus the effective\n\nequivalance ratio A, in Figures 60 and 61, respectively. With excess air,\n\nthe conversion efficiency of CO levels out at about 95 percent, while the con\xc2\xad\nversion fficiency of HC reaches about 64 percent.

Interactions among the various\n\nsystem modifications were not considered in the selection process. Although\n\nit is recognized that such interactions probably exist, it was beyond the\n\nscope of the present work to examine thoroughly all combinations of the modi\xc2\xad\nfications studied.\n\nBased on the driving cycle results from the EC dynamometer, EGR/Spark\n\nAdvance Control Strategy No. 6 was chosen for implementation on the vehicle.\n\nThis strategy gave the best fuel economy at the same emissions levels in\n\nthese tests. The stock AIR strategy was maintained since test results indi\xc2\xad\ncated that adequate air was being supplied for the catalytic conversion of HC\n\nand CO under most operating conditions. The stock EGR delay time was used\n\nsince no improvement was observed for other delay times.\n\nThe electrically-heated hot spot demonstrated some improvement in cold\xc2\xad\nstart emissions; therefore, it was used in the vehicle tests. The exhaust\n\nsystem was the parallel path configuration, shown in Figure 37, with the cold\xc2\xad\nstart catalyst unit and standard catalyst unit modified with the electrically\xc2\xad\nheated catalyst element, shown in Figure 39.\n\nTEST RESULTS\n\nTesting of the modified vehicle was done on the JPL chassis dynamometer\n\nfacility. To provide a better baseline for the modified tests, the stock\n\nvehicle tests were made using the modified exhaust hardware with all exhaust\n\ngas being directed through the standard catalyst unit. The test results for\n\nthese vehicle tests are given in Table 19. All tests were complete cold\xc2\xad\nstart urban driving cycles. Emissions results are shown in both grams per\n\nbag and weighted g/mi over the driving cycle. Plots of the fuel economy\n\nand emissions are given in Figures 63, 64, and 65.\n\nResults of the modified vehicle tests can be summarized by looking at\n\nthree of the modified tests. In modified test No. 1, the vehicle matched\n\nthe fuel economy and NOx emissions of the baseline and reduced HC emissions\n\nfrom 0.5 to 0.4 g/mi and reduced CO emissions from 3.8 to 2.7 g/mi. For\n\nmodified test No. 6, fuel economy increased from 15.0 to 15.9 MPG, HC\n\nemissions decreased from 0.5 to 0.4 g/mi and CO emissions decreased from 3.8\n\nto 3.2 g/mi when NOx emissions were allowed to increase from 1.1 to 1.6 g/mi.\n\nBy making the NOx emissions requirement less stringent, further increases in\n\nfuel economy and reductions of HC and CO emissions were possible. By letting\n\nNOx emissions increase from 1.1 to 2.7 g/mi in test No. 3, fuel economy\n\nincreased from 15.0 to 16.9 MPH, HC emissions were reduced from 0.5 to 0.21\n\ng/mi and CO emissions decreased from 3.8 to 2.4 g/mi.. The fuel economy values\n\ndiscussed here are based on carbon balance calculations from the CVS emissions\n\n\n92\n\n\nTable 19.\n\nChassis Dynamometer Results for Vehicle\n\nwith Modified Emissions Control System\n\nTest\n\nDay\n\nTape\n\nFuel\nNpOw t\n\nEconomy\nPGQvs\n\nBag 1\n\n(g)\nBag 2\n\nBag 3\n\nBag I\n\nCO (g)\nBag 2\n\nBag 3\n\nBag I\n\nBaseline\nBaseline\nBaseline\nAverage\nBaseline\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n\n6279\n6280\n6281\n\n1106\n1231\n1232\n\n13.60\n13.74\n14.16\n\n4.78\n14.86\n15.10\n\n4.58\n3.98\n4.17\n\n0.62\n0.60\n0.85\n\n1.82\n1.02\n3.52\n\n64.25\n58.85\n60.28\n\n0.96\n1.46\n1.03\n\n3.12\n2.94\n2.06\n\n5.56\n4.84\n4.41\n\n3.79\n3(69\n3.67\n\n4.65\n4.42\n4.50\n\n0.48\n0.39\n0.62\n\n4.05\n3.79\n3.75\n\n1.18\n1.10\n1.09\n\n6292\n6293\n6294\n6295\n6296\n6301\n\n.1553\n1554\nx616\nx618\nx619\nx620\n\n.13.83\n13.38\n14.26\n15.06\n\'3.58\n14.08\n13.94\n\n14.91\n14.84\n15.99\n16.95\n15.14\n16.90\n15.90\n\n4.24\n3.62\n2.67\n2.30\n3.67\n3.45\n3.53\n\n0.69\n0.94\n0.32\n0.32\n0.72\n0.53\n0.89\n\n2.12\n0.83\n0.58\n0.45\n0.85\n0.63\n1.28\n\n61.13\n29.57\n63.97\n37.92\n85.16\n72.85\n49.28\n\n1.15\n0.89\n0.29\n0.12\n2.15\n1.73\n1.18\n\n2.71\n11.62\n9.29\n3.20\n14.23\n10.22\n4.15\n\n4.94\n3.98\n4.80\n6.22\n3.04\n3.84\n4.92\n\n3.72\n4.31\n14.06\n14.64\n5.59\n8.49\n7.52\n\n4.52\n3.15\n5.26\n5.83\n2.16\n.3.01\n3.S1\n\n0.50\n0.40\n0.24\n0.21\n0.37\n0.32\n0.42\n\n3.86\n2.70\n4.41\n2.43\n6.25\n5.18\n3.30\n\n1.12\n1.04\n2.55\n2.75\n1.08\n1.58\n1.57\n\nH\n\nNO, (8)\nBag 2\n\nHC\nBag 3(/ (g/\n\nCO\nC)\n\nNO\n(g0)\n\n~~0\nIPQ\n\n%Or\n-I\n\nNte\nNotes\n\nMod c,,nfg.\n\nChoke open\nStock choke\n\nNo\n\nCSC\n\n17\n\n1\n\n1 05\n\n16\n\nI\n\n03\n\n2\n0\n\n6\n0\n\n4\n0\n15 -10\n\n0=\n\nBASELINE\n\nNUMBERS REFER TO\nTEST NUMBERS\n\n14 1I\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\nI\n1.5\n\nI\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\n3.0\n\nNOX, 9/mi\n\nFigure 63.\n\nFuel Economy Versus NOx Emissions for\nModified Vehicle Tests\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n1\n\n0\n\n0.4\nr=\n\n6\n\n0\n\n04\n\nLi\n\n405\n\n0.2\n\n0 = BASELINE\n\n2\n0\n\n0\n\nNUMBERS REFER TO\nTEST NUMBERS\n0\n0.5\n\nI\n1.0\n\nI\n1.5\n\nI\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\nN 0x, G/mi\n\nFigure 64.\n\nHC Emissions Versus NOx Emissions for\nModified Vehicle Tests\n94\n\n3.0\n\n0.8 \t\n\n-I\n\nI\n\nIB\n\nI\n\nI\n\n0 BASELINE\nNUMBERS REFER TO\n\n0.7 \t\n\nTEST NUMBERS\n0.6\n0.5 \xc2\xad\n1 \n6\n\n0\n\n0.4 \t\n\n4\n0\n\n3\n-0\n\n0.3\n\n0\n\n0.20 02-03 \t\n\n2\n\n0.1.\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n5\nCO,g/mi\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\n0\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\nFigure 65. \t HC Emissions Versus CO Emissions\n\nfor Modified Vehicle Tests\n\nresults. This is the method used in the mileage numbers published from EPA\n\ntests. These vehicle results are summarized in Table 20.\n\n\nThe results, from the vehicle tests were not as good as expected.\n\nApparently, interactions among the various modifications tended to cancel\n\nsome of the individual\'benefits. The results again emphasize the difficulty\n\nof demonstrating with hardware the potential of concepts which look technically\n\nsound\'. With a more thorough evaluation of some of these concepts, it i \'likely\n\nthat more of their apparent potential could be achieved. It seems clear that\n\nthe selection and implementation of modified c6ntrol strategies or new emis\xc2\xad\nsions control devices is a complex process which must be treated from a systems\n\nstandpoint with all impoftant interactions considered. The effect of engine\n\nequivalence ratio variations should also be included in any future fuel\n\neconomy/emissions trade-off study.\n\n\n95\n\n\nORIGINAL PAG4 i8\nOF POOR QUALITY\nTable 20. \t Modified Vehicle Test Results for\n\nUrban Driving Cycle\n\n\nTest\nBaseline\n\nNOx Level\n\n(g/mi)\n1.1 \t\n\nResults*\n\nMPG\n\n14.91\n\n\nHC\n\nCO\n\n1\n\n1.1 \t\n\n0.50 g/mi\n\n\n3.86 g/mi\n\n\nSame MPG\n\nReduce HC from 0.5 to 0.4 g/mi\n\nReduce CO from 3.9 to 2.7 g/mi\n\n\n6 \t\n\n1.6\n\nIncrease MPG from 15.0 to 15.9\n\nReduce HC from 0.5 to 0.4 g/mi\n\nReduce CO from 3.9 to 3.3 g/mi\n\n\n3\n\n2.7 \t\n\nIncrease MPG from 15.0 to 16.9\n\nReduce HC from 0.5 to 0.2 g/mi\n\nReduce CO from 3.9\'to 2.4 g/mi\n\n\n*Fuel economy based on carbon balance technique.\n\n\n96\n\n\nREFERENCES\n\n\n1. \t EPA/FEA 1975 Gas\'Mileag& Guide fo\n\nNew Car Buyers.\n\n\n2. \t Chrysler Corporation Chassis Service Manual for the1975 Passenger Car.\n\n3. \t Austin, T.

These results were\n\nneeded to provide an indication of the EGR flow rate through the valve during\n\nengine operation. A schematic of the test setup is shown in Figure B-1. The\n\nnitrogen gas was supplied to the valve from a plenum chamber. Flow rate was\n\nmeasured using a Meriam laminar flow element. Pressures and temperatures\n\nmeasured during these calibration tests are identified in the figure.\n\nPhotographs of the test setup are given in Figures B-2 and B-3.\n\nCalibration curves based on these tests are given in Figures B-4 and\n\nB-5. These curves have been used to estimate EGR flow rate from measurements\n\nof valve pressure drop, valve control pressure (Pvac), exhaust gas temperature,\n\nambient pressure, and ambient temperature.\n\n\nB-2\n\n\nORIGINAL PAGE IS\n\nOF POOR QUALTY\n\n\n\'17\n\n=MERIAM\n\nLAMINAR\n\nAv*\n\n\nFLOW ELEAN T \n\n\n=\n\n~EGR \t\n\nVALVE\n\nPRESSURE REGULATOR\nPLENUM CHAMBER\n\n[\t PRESSURE\n--\n\n--.\nTEMPERAITURE\n\nFigure B-. \t Flow Rate Calibration Schematic\n\nfor EGR Valve\n\n\nB-3\n\n\nFigure B-2.\n\nTest Setup for EGR V\n\nB-A;\n\n(Clibraiion\n\nFigure B-3.\n\nPOOR\n\nEGR Valve Calibration\n\nPCON =2.5 2.7 3.1\n3.7\n4.2\nTO 5.3\n\n4 -4.8\n\n2\n\na.0\nn\n\nt 0.8\nC\n\n~\n~06,/PCON4\n\n(PMB-PVAd)pd\n\n/\n\n,14.7 011\n\n/\n0.1\n\nTo\n\n/\n20\n\nFigure B-4.\n\nI\n\n40\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\n80so 0\n60\nCORECTED AIRFLOW, w\n\n200\n,r\n\n400\n\n600\n\nFlow Rate Calibration Curve for\nEGR Valve No. 1\n\nB-5\n\n1000\n\nCALIBRATION OF AIR PUMP\n\n\nThe AIR pump was calibrated using room temperature air to determine the\n\nflow rate characteristics of the pump. These results were needed to provide a\n\nmeasure of the air flow rate provided by the pump during engine operation.\n\nA schematic of the test setup is shown in Figure B-6. The pump was driven by\n\nan electric motor and variable pulley belt drive. Flow rate was measured using\n\na Meriam laminar flow element. Pressures and temperatures measured during\n\nthese calibration tests are identified in the figure. Photographs of the test\n\nsetup are given in Figures B-7 and B-8.\n\nCalibration curves based on these tests are given in Figure B-9.
