An approximate series expression is developed, based upon knowledge of the analytical characteristic behavior of the mutual admittance between small aperture antenna elements in a conducting ground plane. This expression is utilized to analytically extend known values for a few spacings and orientations to other element configurations, thus eliminating the need to numerically integrate a large number of highly oscillating and slowly converging functions. This paper shows that the technique can predict very accurately the mutual coupling between elements in a very large planar array with a knowledge of the self-admittance of an isolated element and the coupling between only two-elements arranged in eight different pair combinations. These eight pair combinations do not necessarily have to correspond to pairs in the large array, although all of the individual elements must be identical.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19960049766, "id": "b18640bf55f042be9f634c3169250f67", "publicationDate": "1996-08-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19960049766.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19960049766/downloads/19960049766.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19960049766/downloads/19960049766.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19960049766/downloads/19960049766.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
