Grid technology provides a low cost and effective method of enabling production of science products by the science community. To demonstrate this, the LGP partnered with NASA GSFC scientists and used their existing science algorithms to generate virtual Landsat-like data products using distributed data resources. LGP created 48 output composite scenes with 4 input scenes each for a total of 192 scienes processed in parallel. The demonstration took 12 hours, which beat the requirement by almost 50 percent, well within the LDCM requirement to process 250 scenes per day. The LGP project also showed the successful use of workflow tools to automate the processing. Investing in this technology has led to funding for a ROSES ACCESS proposal. The proposal intends to enable an expert science user to produce products from a number of similar distributed instrument data sets using the Land Cover Change Community-based Processing and Analysis System (LC-ComPS) Toolbox. The LC-ComPS Toolbox is a collection of science algorithms that enable the generation of data with ground resolution on the order of Landsat-class instruments.", "title": "LDCM Grid Prototype (LGP)", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-23T18:49:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20060045870, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Weinstein, Beth"}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Headquarters", "location": "Washington, DC United States"}}, "id": "ab90b16609a84137bb5412413da5c3f2"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 20060045870, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Lubelczyk, Jeff"}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Headquarters", "location": "Washington, DC United States"}}, "id": "6ea6f8fdef684c8dbcf83ebf59ede3c1"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-23T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20060045870, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20060045870, "id": "b5837450028743a6952c83a2c1fc68a4", "publicationDate": "2006-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
