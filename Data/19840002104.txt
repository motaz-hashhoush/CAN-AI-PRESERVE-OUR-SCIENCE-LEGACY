SPACELAB MISSION NO. 1\n\nOF POOR QUALrTy\n\nWBS 35.0 - SUPPORT SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT\nWBS 35.1 - Mission Peculiar Equipment (MPE)\nTwo shipments of SL-1 stowage MPE were made to KSC this period.\nThe middle shelf stowage hardware was shipped on August 26, and the\nadditional NDRR tape stowage hardware was shipped on September 9, 1983.\nWBS 75.0 - PAYLOAD INTEGRATION REQUIREMENTS\nWBS 75.2 - MPE G. C-TGir\n\nWe continued to modify the flight stowage support hardware design\nto accommodate stowage of additional flight items. These changes were\nextensive and required quick turnaround to meet the Spacelab closeout date\nof September 14, 1983.\nWBS 75.9 GMound Operations Analysis and Requirements Definition\nWe continued to support KSC activities through GIRD maintenance.\nWBS 75.11 - Configuration Change Coordination and Processing\nDuring this period, we prepared and distributed to the review team\nthe SL-1 Phase II FRR Package, which contained all Engineering Change\nRequests (ECRs), Deviations, Waivers, Field Engineering Changes (FECs), and\nProblem Reports (PRs) approved after May 19, 1983.\nWe continued to process ECRs and ECPs submitted to the SL-1\nConfiguration Control Boards (CCBs) both Level II and Level III MPE. We\nprocessed 32 ECRs through the Level II CCB, and 4 ECRs through the Level\nIII MPE CCB.\nWBS 75.12 - Interface Agreements\nUpdate of the IIAs, the VFI Interface Control Document (ICU), and\nthe MPE Requirements Document continued with change page development for\napproved ECRs.\nWBS 75.13 - Integrated Payload Cora atibility\nated\nStructural verification cleanup work continued on the stress\nanalysis or stowed items. Miscellaneous cable ties and stowage container\n\nstraps were evaluated during the last month. All margins of safety remain\npositive.\nThe Mission Manager\'s Payload Integration Support Group at KSC continued to support the payload activities at KSC. We are also supporting the\nSL-1 simulation activities at the POCC at JSC and the HOSC at MSFC in\npreparation for the SL-1 October launch.\nWBS 95.0 - PAYLOAD FLIGHT OPERATIONS INTEGRATION\nWBS 95.1 - Onboard Flight/Mission Operations\nPreparatio^ of *he final Payload Flight Data File (PFDF) items con-\n\ntinued throughout the reporting period. The final issues of 90 percent of\nthe PFDF items have been published and distributed. PFDFs were prepared and\nmaintained to support Integrated Training/Proficiency Training (IT/PT) conducted at MSFC during July, August, and September 1983 and to support the\ninitial Joint Integrated Simulations (JIS) conducted at JSC, which were supported from the HOSC and the Payload Crew Training Complex (PCTC) at MSFC.\nSupport was provided in the PCTC to prepare for and conduct the\nIT/PT.\nWBS 95.2 - POCC Requirements\nWe supported the final POCC data base verification effort by sending\ntwo people to JSC during the week of August 22, 1983. During September\n1983, we prepared a data base to support HOSC operations during the mission.\nNew layouts of the POCC Cadre Room, POCC User Room, and Off-line\nUser Area Room were prepared to support a MSFC review in September 1983.\nThe initial JIS was conducted during the last week of July 1983. A\nchange in the JIS schedule provided the needed time to prepare for and conduct simulations, beginning with a 30-hour launch and activation simulation\nstarting on September 15, 1983, followed by a 75-hour simulation starting on\nSeptember 19, 1983. In preparation for these simulations, we attended\nmeetings at JSC on August 8-9 and August 29-30, 1983. Additional effort was\napplied to this task in the form of one individual with exoerience in the\narea of mission operations by means of a subcontract to TOE.\n\n4-2\n\nDuring this time period, Revision A of the POCC Data Base\nMaintenance and Verification System Users Guide, JA-332, was delivered to\n\nMr. Archie Jackson, NASA / MSF\'C/EL14. Nine copies were delivered. This\ndocument reflects all modifications made to the system between February\n1983 and July 1983.\nA three-man element of support is being provided to the Statusing\nand Reporting Section of the SL-1 Mission HOSC Operations Team. This element will assist by maintaining Payload Charts on a 24-hour basis for both\nthe JIS and the SL-1 mission. We participated in the JIS conducted on\n\nSeptember 15, 19dJ\nWBS 95.3 - P ^yloa d Da t a Processing Requirements\n\nApproximately three weeks of etfort went into preparations for a\n4-day meeting that we attended at GSFC during the week of August 29, 1983,\nto address data processing requirements and problems with the Pis.\nAssistrnce will be provided in developing the Orbiter Ancillary Data\nProcessing Requirements at MSFC.\nWBS 95.4 - Public Affairs Inflight Video and Photographic kequirements\n\nWe continued to update the content of the TV/Photo Operations Book\nas a result of training and changes to coverage requirements. A 2-day\nscene development exerf:ise was conducted during the week of September 5,\n1983, in support of this update effort. A complete Revision A of the\nTV/Photo Operations Book will be published in October 1983.\nWe manned the TV Ops position in the POCC for the initial JIS in\nlate July and early August 1983 and for the 30-hour simulation starting on\n\nSeptember 15, 1983. The final issue of the operating procedures for the\nPOCC TV Operation position (DR FI-16) was prepared and delivered on\nSeptember 15, 1983.\nTV operations training was provided to the payload crew in the\nPCTC on September 8, 1983.

OSTA PARTIAL PAYLOADS\n\nWBS 35.0 - SUPPORT SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT\nWBS 35.1 - Mission Peculiar Equipment (MPE)\nAll OAST-1 MPE is in the fabrication shop, and the piece parts\nare now approximately 70 percent complete. Tooling and GHE designs are\napproximately 50 percent complete, and the hardware is approximately 35\npercent complete. All MPE attachment hardware is either on order or on\nhand. No problems are anticipated with attachment hardware. The SCCF\nmounting plate was compl,ced, painted, and shipped to Lockheed on\nSeptember 12, 1983. The DAE Alignment Procedure has been completed and\nis awaiting CCB action. The MPE Assemb l y Procedure is being updated.\nOur manufacturing division has been authorized to proceed with\nfabrication of MSL-1 MPE. The shoulder bolts have been completed and\nthe raw materials for the "Gas Can Beams" have been received and rough\ncut to size. Machining is scheduled to start the first week in October.\nWBS 75.0 - PAYLOAD INTEGRATION REQUIREMENTS\nWBS 75.2 MPE Design\nOne hundred percent completion of the OAST-1 MPE parts and\nassembly drawings was achieved.\nVerification review items for the OAST-1 SAE experiment were\nassessed and completed. Technical requirements and design support were\nprovided to facilitate the final design of a Power Control Box Heater\nAssembly for the OAST-1 payload.\nFinal design documentation packages for the OAST-1 payload were\nrevised to reflect the addition of fuse modules. These were provided to\nprotect wiring between the SAE experiment and the Aft Flight Deck\nDeployment and Pointing Panel per JSC interface requirements. Documentation revised included the cable interconnect diagram, end-to-end\nsystem schematic, cable assembly drawings, and Part I and Part II CEI\nspecifications.\n\nGRIQINAL PAO. 13\nOF POUR QUALM\n7-1\n\nI\nMSL-1 MPE drawings were updated to show new attachments for the\nMLI grounding straps. Also, approval of MSL-1 Deviation Approval\nRequest (TBE 043) was received during this period.\nThe MEM design was completed during this period. A CDR data\npackage was submitted to MSFC for review.\nA breadboard of all the TBE-designed electronics was built anI\nexercised in the development laboratory. Each circuit performed without\nknown problems.\nThe deve\'cment o f the MEM is behind schedule due to late\ndelivery of the GFE tape recorder and apparent problems in the tape\nrecorder. Problems were encountered in reading data from the tape\nrecorder. Different results were obtained when attempting to read from\nall four tracks. It has also been observed that the read electronics\ndoes not reconstitute all bit patterns equally. It is believed that the\nread electronics contains a low pass filter that was designed for the\n4-IPS tape recorder. This unit was modified to operate at 12 IPS. The\nresult of this problem is a severe attenuation of a consecutive string\nof "1" or "O."\nFabrication of the MEM breadboard enclosure and ADSF simulator\nis nearing completion. This unit will be complete by October 1. If the\ntape recorder problem can be solved, the breadboard unit will support\nsimulated ADSF operational (simulated mission timeline) tests to verify\nthe capability of the unit to record the data over a complete mission.\nPC board layout and basic board fabrication of the data acquisition and tape recorder control board will be subcontracted to a CAD/CAM\nfirm. TBE will then stuff the board, solder, and conformal coat the\nassembly. The procurement package for this board is complete and we are\nready to initiate procurement. Modification of the SEP enclosure to\nconvert to a MEM will begin when the CDR DNs are received, reviewed, and\nincorporated into the drawings such that they may be baselined and\nreleased to manufacturing.\n\n7-2\n\na -A\n\nORMNAL PAGE 15\n\nOF POOR QUALM\nWBS 75.4 - Command and Data Requirements\n\nOn August 23 and 24, we participated in the OAST-1 Payload\nOperations Working Group meeting at JSC. Subsequently, we began to\nprepare a Data Change Request (DCR) for a PIP Annex 4 update based upon\nJSC and MSFC comments. Also, a memorandum with updates for the\nFunctional Subsystem Software Requirements (FSSR) Document is being\nprepared.\nDuring the period, we participated in telecons with the JSC Crew\nTraining Branch (Keven Koiey) regarding OAST-1 MCOS display pages. In\naddition, we have prepareu recommended Annex 4 and FSSR changes to\ndisplay the SAE containment box oven temperature, and have suggested\nOAST-1 ground displays for MCC and HOSC, with cross-correlation tables\nand item descriptions.\nWBS 75 . 5 - Environmental System Integration\nTimelined analyses were performed to determine the maximum\ntemperature of the OAST-1 DAE tape recorder. The analyses showed the\ntape recorder to exceed the maximum allowable temperature if the\nrecorder is painted white. A subsequent analysis indicated that the\nrecorder would remain within allowable temperature if it was covered\nwith silverized Teflon. The analyses were documented and a technical\nmemorandum was sent to SPPO.\nWBS 75.6 - Electrical Systems Integration\n\nAn end-to-end sneak circuit analysis of the OAST-1 payload was\ncompleted and delivered on schedule.\nWBS 75.8 - Pointing/Stabilization Systems Integration\nTwo tasks were pursued for the study being performed to res^jive\nOAST-1 DN 2-452-2873. First, revised aerodynamic data from JSC was\nincorporated into the OSOS computer code. Second, a STS-4 gravitygradient, free-drift simulation was run using the revised OSOS program.\nWe are presently awaiting data from JSC to use in verifying this\nsimulation.\n\n7-3\n\nO1tlGWAL ME 19\n\nOf POOR QUALM\nThe STS Flight Control System (FCS) simulation used\'in the OSOS\ncomputer progra-n was previously found to be obsolete.

During the period, DNs were incorporated and results from\n\n8-5\n\n!\t\n\n,\n\nthe PCA Deploy and Restow analyses, mechanical and thermal interface\ndefinition between the IRS and electronic boxes, and VFI system\nrequirements were added. Plans are to baseline the document in early\nOctober 1983.\nSystems Engineering continued analyses on the PCA Deploy and\nRestow Study and developed a preliminary FMEA for the PCA at the mission\nsystems level. Major changes were made to the. Deploy and Restow budget\nfor the Pitch = 0 phase in the Systems Requirements Document based upon\na better understanding of the error sources.\nA list of ouesti .s and data requirements was prepared\nconcerning the ESA IPS and Rockwell clams required as inputs to the\nDeploy and Restow Analyses for the IPS/Astro configuration. Where data\nwere not available, assumptions were made by TBE and presented to NASA\n\nas the basis for\n\ncontinuing analyses until better data is available.\n\nSpecial Astro-1 requirements for the Rockwell clams to be used\non the PCA were presented to Rockwell and to NASA. Also, a new concept\nfor carrying axial loads into a longeron clam was reviewed for possible\nincorporation into the Astro PCA to eliminate the need for a keel clamp.\nThe Astro-1 verification program continued with revisions to the\nCruciform, MLI and Mounting Hardware Verification Plan, the IRS\nVerification Plan, and the PCA Verification Plan.. In addition, a fourth\ndocument, the VFI Preliminary Verification Plan, has been prepared for\nreview. Special test plans in support of the four basic verification\ndocuments are in preparation for an October-November period review\nbefore the CDR. The special test plans include the Telescope Alignment\nTest Plan, the Pallet/PCA/Cruciform Alignment Test Plan, the IRS Thermal\nVacuum Test Plan, and the IRS Acoustical Test Plan. Considerable\nprogress is being made in the definition of special plan test fidelity\nand GSE requirements.\nVerification plans from the HUT, UIT, and WUPPE CDR data\npackages were reviewed and are in the process of being reformatted to\nreflect the TBE verification format. The new format will specify data\n\n8-6\n\na\xe2\x80\xa2\tf\n\n01 tNAL PAGE 19\nOf POOR QUALITY\nrequirements that shall be sent by NASA to-the experimenters for PI\nconcurrence.\nA logging system was implemented to control weight/mass\nproperties data inputs to the data base. Biweekly weight status\nreporting was instituted based on preliminary dra%ing releases. The\nlatest estimate of the current TBE MPE weight shows the limit weight set\nby the Mission Manager to\'be exceeded by 190 kg.\nThe MPE Development Plan was revised and issued to incorporate\nmajor changes in verification test schedules since MPE PDR.\nWeekly MPE Deve. pment Status Meetings are now being held. The\npurpose of the meetings is to jointly review Astro development status as\nit pertains to design, manufacturing, r r ocurement, testing, and\nprocedures with a view towards identifying potential problem areas.\nProcurement of long lead time . items, such as titanium, invar,\nheat pipes, optical cubes, and aluminum plate has been initiated.\nA progress review for the Wide Field Camera was held August 18,\n1983. Concerns expressed at the meeting were worked for incorporation\ninto the PDR documentation.\nThe PDR for the Wide Field Camera was held September 13-15,\n1983.

In addition to the analog and discrete I/O\ncards, t\xe2\x96\xbate specification definition included the ETR interface card, the\nSerial/Digital Input/Output (SDIG) interface card, and the LGAS interface card. Action items were accepted to consider .a GPC data bus interface option to the SDIO, to support LGAS alternative studies, and to\nstudy backup alternatives in the event of SCU development delay. A\npresentation was given to recommend continuation of the SDIO development\ninstead of undertaking GPC data bus interface development. A letter\nsummarizing the presentation was submitted at MSFC\'s request. The LGAS\nalternative study, conducted by MSFC, is scheduled for completion on\nSeptember 23, 1983. The SCU Backup Tradeoff Study conducted by 1BE is\nscheduled for presentation on September 18, 1983.\nIn the area of SCU and SCU GSE software, the definition of the\nrequirements was initiated. Contact was made with the Information and\nElectronics Systems Laboratory. A meeting to discuss our software\napproach will be scheduled in the near future.\nPreliminary configuration layouts were prepared in support of\nthe MSL-2 RR. MPE design drawings were started and are 30 percent complete.\nThe MSL-2 MPE NASTRAN Model was completed. This model will be\nused to perform stress analysis of the rails and crossties and to verify\nminimum natural frequency requirements. The Integrated Payload NASTRAN\nStructural Model was also completed. This model is being used to fine\ntune the MPESS design to meet the.minimum frequency requirements.\nStructural analyses for experiment and subsystem mountin g hardware, including the coldplate support structure, are 60 percent completed.\nThermal analyses were performed to define the MPE thermal\nrequirements. The thermal requirements were incorporated in the System\nSpecification delivered at the RR. Thermal compatibility analyses were\nstarted.

One machined end fitting is.90 percent complete and the other has not been started due to a machine breakdown.\nThis machine is scheduled to be back in operation on September 27 and\nmachining of the other end fitting will begin.\nTD-JA02-83-04, dated August 8, 1983, authorized the performance\nof the Dedicated Discipline Laboratory (BBL) Cost-Effectiveness Study.\nA review of the li _ardic to DDLs has been made, and the Shuttle High\nf Energy Astrophysics Laboratory (SHEAL) has been selected as the srawmar\nfor detailed study. A methodology has been established to determine the\ncost, schedule, and hardware impacts of various implementation options\n4\n\nfor the SHEAL flight/reflight scenario. With regard to analytical integration, the TOE cost model covering analytical experiment integration,\n\t\nf\n\nMPE, and ground and flight software has been modified to reflect the\nSMICA new mission scenario and post-modification checkout/testing has\nbeen completed. With regard to physical integration, the assumption has\nbeen made that this is a level-of-effort activity and that cost correlates closely with activity duration. Schedule data has been compiled\nthat pertains to various integration/deintegration scenarios. The\nmethodology will be applied to a set of SHEAL configurations to determine the cost/schedule sensitivities of various implementation options\nand will result in the identification of a preferred approach.\nTD-JA02-83-05, dated August 9, 1983, directed TOE to prepare an\narrow network and associated activity description documentation based on\nthe SL-6 mission.
