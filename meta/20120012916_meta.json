Lidar, which stands for Light Detection And Ranging, is a powerful tool in remote sensing from space. Compared to radars, lidars operate at a much shorter wavelength with a much narrower beam and much smaller transmitter and receiver. Compared to passive remote sensing instruments. lidars carry their own light sources and can continue measuring day and night. and over polar regions. There are mainly two types of lidars depending on the types of measurements. lidars that are designed to measure the distance and properties of hard targets are often called laser rangers or laser altimeters. They are used to obtain the surface elevation and global shape of a planet from the laser pulse time-of-night and the spacecraft orbit position. lidars that are designed to measure the backscattering and absorption of a volume scatter, such as clouds and aerosols, are often just called lidars and categorized by their measurements. such as cloud and aerosol lidar, wind lidar, CO2 lidar, and so on. The advantages of space-based lidar systems over ground based lidars are the abilities of global coverage and continuous measurements.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20120012916, "endDate": "2012-05-11T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers", "location": "New York, NY, United States"}}, "meetingId": "055291e5b52f4df9a9af1c395c737c07", "id": "321ca52d28384461b37bd3596ca8196f"}], "name": "2nd Conference of Laser and Electro-Optics (CLEO)", "location": "San Jose, CA", "id": "055291e5b52f4df9a9af1c395c737c07", "startDate": "2012-05-06T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20120012916, "id": "08fb4228d7844916b442230c25e99e4d", "publicationDate": "2012-05-06T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20120012916.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20120012916/downloads/20120012916.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20120012916/downloads/20120012916.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20120012916/downloads/20120012916.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
