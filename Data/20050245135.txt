Ab und ant renewab le energy at lunar or Eruth-Moon Libration (e.g., "Ll")\nlocations cou ld SUppOlt propellant production and sto rage in refueling scenarios that enab le\naffordab le exp loration. Renewab le energy platforms in geostationary Earth orbit (GEO) can\nco ll ect and transmit power to satellites, or to Earth-surface locations. Energy-rich space\ntechnologies also enabl e the use of electri c-powe red propulsion systems that co uld efficiently\ndeliver cargo and exp lorat ion faci lities to remote locatio ns. A first step to an energy-ri ch space\ninfrastructure is a IOO-kWe class so lar-powered platform in Earth orbit. The platform wou ld\nutilize advanced technologies in solar power collection and generat ion, power management and\ndistribution, therma l management, and electric propulsion. It would also provide a power-rich\nfree-fly ing platform to demonstrate in space a portfolio of techno logy flight experiments.\nThis paper discusses the reasons why such advances are important to future affordable and\nsustai nab le operations in space. It also presents preliminary concepts for a IOO-kWe so larpowered satellite with the capab ility to flight-demonstrate a variety of payload ex peri ments and to\nutilize electri c propulsion. State-of-the-art so lar co ncentrators, hi ghl y efficient multi-junction\nso lar cell s, integrated thermal management on the arrays, and innovative dep loyab le structu re\ndesign and packaging make the lOO-kW satellite feas ibl e for launch on one existing launch\nvehicle. Higher voltage arrays and power management and distribution (PMAD) systems reduce\nor eliminate the need for massive power converters, and cou ld enab le direct-drive of hi gh-voltage\nsolar electric thrusters .\n\n- I -\n\nJ\n\nAn Affordability Challenge\n\ntypical EEL V (evolved expendable launch\nvehicles) costs per launch at the same rate.\n\nOne of the central barriers to more\nambitious-yet still affordable-space\noperations in the Earth\'s neighborhood lies\nin our inability to affordably preposition\nconsurnables (particularly propellants) and\nneeded systems (including spares for in\nspace servicing and maintenance). As long\nas it is not possible to locally repair and\nrefuel high-value (and high-cost) space\nsystems beyond low Earth orbit (LEO). This\nchallenge affects planning for a wide range\nof potential future missions, but is\nparticularly important for (a) major, highvalue missions such as human exploration\nactivities beyond low Earth orbit; (b) largescale defense and/or security focused\nmission systems; or, (c) \'future space\nindustries\' (such as larger, multi-payload\ngeostationary Eroih orbit (GEO) platforms,\nspace solar power systems, and related\nconcepts).\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nExcursion Transpoli: Assuming expendable\nsystems, involving nominally a descent\nmodule and an ascent module with a\ncombined mass of about 10,000 kg to\n20,000 kg (and a recurring unit per kilogram\ncost of approxi mately $50,000 per\nkilogram), for a " per mission cost" of about\n$750M per mi ss ion.\nTransportation Operations . Assuming\nincremental improvements on Space Shuttle\nand International Space Station (ISS) era\nground operations concepts" involving\nnominally about 20,000 total personnel\n(with an average cost of about $) 00,000 per\nFTE2 (full time equivalent)), for a " program\nper year cost" of about $2,000M, and a per\nmission cost of about $500M per mission at\na rate of 4 mi ss ions per year, or about to\n$667M per mission at a rate of3 missions\nper year.\n\nFor example, a large-scale, permanently\ninhabited lunar base might involve 3-4\nhuman missions to the Moon per year (for\ncrew rotation every 120 days or 90 days,\nrespectively). However, if such a mission\nscenario were to involve Apollo-era\nconcepts and current-technology expendable\nspace transportation systems, then the total\ncost per mission due to transportation costs\nalone (hardware and operations), could\nrange from $2,400M per mission to more\nthan $3,100M per mission (current year\ndollars). Transportation cost components\nhere are assumed to include the following:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n[n Space Transport: Assuming expendable\nsystems involving at least two in-space\nstages with individual mass of about 10,000\nkg (and a recurring unit per kilogram cost of\nabout $50,000 per kilogram \') for a " per\nmi ss ion cost" of about $500M per mi ss ion .\n\nI The ve ry rough , mass-based cost estimation\nrelationships (CERs) used in thi s ill u tration are\nintended to be consistent with-and perhaps a bit on\nthe optimistic side of- past human-rated space\nsystems recurrin g hardware costs. A more detailed\nanalysis wou ld consider the specific cost per\nkilogram for each of the major elements in each\nsy tem, as well as taking into accou nt the specific\nnumber of unique elements to be manufactured over\nthe life of the program , and the degree to which\nadvanced production methods (such lean\nmanufacturing) mi ght be brought to bear on the\nproblem. However, for the purposes of this\ndiscussion , the single va lue of \' about $50,000 per\nkilogram (abo ut $22,000 per pound) for recurring\nfli ght hardware costs eems adequate.\n2 This figure is intended to be a very rou gh average,\nintegratin g all perso nnel involved; clearly so me cost\ncategories, sllch as seni or engineers, are at mllch\nhi gher labor rates when \'full y wrapped\'.\n\nETa Transport: Assuming Shuttle-derived,\nexpendable systems involving 2 Heavy Lift\nLaunch Vehicles (HLLVs), 1 Crew\nLauncher at a total cost of $500M to\n$l,OOOM per mission. Note that this rough\nestimate for ETO costs is intended to be\ncomparable to (but lower than) the Space\nShuttle at about 3-4 launches per year, plus\n\n-2-\n\nI "\n\nIn summary, this scenario would result in an\nannual cost-for IWlar base transportation\nonly-of approximately $7,000MIyear (best\ncase,3 missions/year), to about\n$ll ,OOOMIyear (worst case, 4 missions per\nyear). Additional costs would, of course be\nincurred for crew transportation systems,\nsupporting infrastructures (such as\ncommunications systems), as well as for the\nwide range of surface systems that would be\nneeded for a lunar base. (It is perhaps worth\nnoting that in the case of the tightly\ninterwoven Space Shuttle and ISS programs,\nthe costs of transportation to and from the\nStation are very roughly equivalent to the\ncosts of ISS engineering and operations. If\nthe same were to hold true for a far-more\ntechnically challenging lunar base and its\ntransportation system, then the total annual\ncosts would be double the figures noted\nabove-or equivalent something greater\nthan the entire current U.S. annual civil\nspace budget.) The total of such annual\noperational costs would, of course, far\nexceed the current annual US investment in\nhuman space flight. Moreover, they would\nnot allow for vitally needed investments in\nthe systems that would allow us to go\nbeyond and initial operational base.\n\nonboard autonomy. Four functional\nchallenges must be resolved to enable this\nhighly desirable, but technical difficult\ntransition:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nLower cost ETO transport (perhaps by\nenabling a transition to launchers that are\nmore s imilar to those used by other\ngovern ment organizations or by commercial\nsectors; and in the long term by transitioning\nto reusable launch vehicles);\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nHighly-autonomous assembly , maintenance\nand servicing of modular systems in space\nand on planetary s urfaces (inc ludin g both\nrobotic a nd crew-assisted operations),\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nAffordable and timely pre-positioning of\nfuel, systems and other materiel throughout\nthe Earth-Moon system (including to the\nsurface of the Moon); and ,\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nReusable, hi ghl y reliable and high-energy in\nspace transportation (and for lunar missions,\nexcurs ion transportation systems).\n\nThe systems that would enable such\nvisionary capabilities must also be highly\nautonomous (to reduce ground operations\ncosts), as well as substantially less\nexpensive to buy and own (with greater\noperational margins than current systems, as\nwell as lower per wlit costs-perhaps\nacrueved through modularity and the\neconomies of production).\n\nAlthough the sketch above is specific to a\nnotional lunar base, the affordability issues\ninvolved are quite similar for a range of\nother ambitious future space operational\nscenarios- particularly those involving (as\ndoes the Terrestrial Planet Imager (TPI)\nconcept) a number of exceptionally large,\nrugh-value imaging systems deployed\nbeyond low Earth orbit (LEO).\n\nDetailed studies would be needed to\ndetermine the appropriate technical\nperformance objectives for such advanced\nsystems-in the context of cost constraints\nand reliability (safety) goals. However, it\nseems plausible to suggest that at a\nminimwn, such future R&D efforts should\ntarget new systems approaches and novel\ntechnologies that would make possible not\nless that a factor of four reduction in per\nmission costs, and perhaps as much as a 10fold reduction. In the case of the lunar base\nexample sketched above, a 4-fold reduction\nwould be equivalent to seeking to achieve a\n\nA Notional Solution\n\nOne potential solution to this challenge is to\nmove successfully to more affordable\nreusable space transportation system\nelements with substantially higher levels of\n\n-3-\n\nlunar base per mission transportation cost of\nno more than $1 ,750M to $2,750M per\nmission--or, in the case of a lO-fold\nreduction, a per mission transportation cost\nof no more than $700M to $l,lOOM per\nmission. (For comparison, note that the\nlatter figures are roughly comparable to the\nfully-loaded costs of Space Shuttle missions\nto LEO at the present time- although they\nare still much greater than the marginal costs\nof such flights.)\n\ntechnologies should be broadly beneficial to\nthe full range of ambitious mission options\nthat are under consideration by various\norganizations.\n\nKey Technical Challenges\nThe central functional issues associated with\naffordably realizing advanced, highly\nreusable architectural concepts lies in\nsolving several key technology challenges.\nThese include:\n\nHowever, setting a goal is hardly the same\nas achieving it. Although the technologies\nneeded to achieve this vision are (in many\ncases) already validated in the laboratory,\nthey are certainly not \' in hand \' or\nsufficiently mature to incorporate into space\nsystems being build today. As a result,\nsubstantial research and technology\ndevelopment and validation must still be\nundertaken in order to realize the potential\ncost savings that are so clearly needed in\nend-to-end space transportation.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nTele-supervised (and eventually\nautonomous) highl y resilient deep space\n\nsystems operations (in this case, \'deep\nspace \' operations includes all ambitious\nmission operations beyond LEO).\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nReconfigurable and self-adaptive modular\nsystems.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Space assembly, maintenance and\nservicing (from the systems level, down\nto the subsystem level).\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Highly fuel -efficient, high reliability, restartable propulsion, such as high-power\nelectric propulsion for cargo and\ncryogenic engines for time critical\nmission (such as those involving\nastronaut crews).\n\nFortunately, the capabilities for local\nrefueling, as well as locally autonomous\nassembly, repair and maintenance are\ninherent for any kind of extended and\nambitious deep space scenario- such as a\nlunar surface base. 3 Moreover, they become\neven more critical as one considers the longterm requirements of human mission to\nMars, much less the far more ambitious\nrequirements of extended human presence\nand activity in space (e.g., space settlements\nor missions beyond the llmer solar system).\nAs a result, the future development of such\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 High-energy propellants for longduration missions (particularly cryogenic\npropellants such as liquid oxygen, liquid\nhydrogen, etc.)\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Long-term storage and management, as\nwell as the highly reliable and low-loss\ntransfer (including transfer in microgravity) of cryogenic propellants.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\nNote: although smaller mi ss ion s-such as those\ninvolvin g traditional communication s satellite mi ght benefit from in- pace refuelin g, low-cost in\nspace tran sportation and similar space operati ons, the\ncosts of developin g and deploy in g sllch\ntransformati onal new capabilities are difficult, if not\nimpo sibl e to ju stify based on these mi ss ions alone.\n\n3\n\nHigh-power, but low-mass space power\ngeneration and management systems\n\nThis paper will deal with a specific class of\nthese technology problems: in particular,\nthose that involve affordable, highefficiency in-space transport of logistics\n\n-4-\n\nusing modular, reconfigurable high-energy\nsystems.\n\nattachment at the central of gravity of the\nintegrated vehicle.\n\nA Novel Concept: MRHE\n\nHowever, at this time MRHE systems entail\nconsiderably greater system development\nuncertainty than more conventional systems\nand technologies (e.g. , fully expendable,\nApollo-era concepts with technologies that\nare already at a flight-like technology\nreadiness level- i.e. , TRL 7-9). As a result,\nsignificant R&D investments are needed\nprior to beginning major systems\ndevelopment. However, if affordability and\nsustainability are important characteristics\n\nModular, reconfigurable high-energy\n(MRHE) systems are one novel conceptual\napproach with the potential to meet the\nchallenge of enabling affordable prepositioning of key logistics (including fuel,\nhardware, and appropriate systems) to points\nbeyond LEO. An MRHE system is an\nintegrated, high power, solar electric\npropulsion (SEP) vehicle that provides high\n\nfuel efficiency from LEO to destinations\n\nfor future transformational space operations,\n\nthroughout the Earth-Moon system\n(including MEO, GEO, low lunar orbit\n(LLO) and Sun-Earth Lagrange points).\n\nthen the development of new technologies\nand capability is essential. MRHE systems\n(or equivalent alternate approaches to\nsolving these strategic challenges) is one\npossible approach.\n\nThe MRHE concept consists of identical\nsolar-powered modules, each equipped with\nan electric propulsion system, assembled in\na reconfigurable arrangement that supports\npower generation redundancy and engineout capabilities. For example, a promising\nMRHE approach is a linear configuration\nsuch.as that illustrated in Figure 1 (shown in\na gravity gradient stabilized mode).\nAlternatively, a tetrahedral configuration has\nalso been examined, such as that illustrated\nin Figure 2.\n\nInitial MHRE Efforts\nA variety of technologies and concepts must\nbe developed to enable a lOO-kWe solarpowered satellite with the capability to\nflight-demonstrate a variety of payload\nexperiments and to utilize electric\npropUlsion. State-of-the-art solar\nconcentrators, highly efficient multi-junction\nsolar cells, integrated thermal management\non the arrays, and innovative deployable\nstructure design and packaging make the\n1OO-kW satellite feasible for launch on one\nexisting launch vehicle. Higher voltage\narrays and power management and\ndistribution (PMAD) systems reduce or\neliminate the need for massive power\nconverters, and could enable direct-drive of\nhigh-voltage solar electric thrusters.\n\nFigure 3 illustrates respectively the full\nsystem and a in a normal-to-the-orbit-plane\nconfiguration. And Figure 4 illustrates a\ntypical self-assembly sequence for an\nMRHE.\nIn any case, the MRHE concept provides for\npayload attachments on each module to\nprovide flexibility and re-configurability\noptions for accommodating multiple\nteclmology experiments and eventually\ndifferent exploration payloads. In the case\nof a linear configuration, the platform may\nalso provide a single, larger payload\n\nAn objective of current R&D efforts, led by\nthe NASA Marshall Space Flight Center,\nwith the strong participation of several other\norganizations (including ASA centerssuch as JPL and GRC- and industry- such\n\n-5-\n\nthat address the need for affordable, routine\nexploration, deli vering cost savings through\nmultiple-unit production, and providing\noptions for affordable module replacement\nand module redundancy. On-orbit assembly\nwill provide mission planners more\nflexibility in choosing launch vehicles and\nsupport hardware, increasing mission value\nand affordability. Figure 5 illustrates two\nalternate approaches that have been\nexamined during the past decade (a\nmonolithic square array and a monolithic\n\' bat-wing \' array). The central question of\neconomic feasibility is whether a modular\napproach can yield a substantially less\nexpensive operational system.\n\nas ENTECH and LM) is the development of\na cluster of four "mini-sats" in order to\naddress all functional and operational issues.\nThe proposed concept consists of identical\nsolar-powered modules, each equipped with\nan electric propulsion system, assembled in\na reconfigurable arrangement that supports\npower generation redundancy and engineout capabilities. The concept also provides\nfor payload attachments on each module to\nprovide flexibility and re-configurability\noptions for accommodating multiple\ntechnology experiments and eventually\ndifferent exploration payloads.\nThe goal of the project is to assess and\nmature the technologies that support future\ndevelopment of a modular architectures and\nsystems; in the case of this project, a 100\nkilowatt-class spacecraft suitable for onorbit assembly and reconfiguration. The\nthrust of the technology maturation effort is\nto integrate a representative advanced solar\npower generation (SPG) system, highvoltage power delivery system (PDS), and\nadvanced thermal management into systemof-systems demonstrations. The activity also\nwill address multi -satellite rendezvous and\nself-assembly, as well as distributed wireless\navionics and robotic reconfiguration in the\nevent of a simulated spacecraft propulsion or\npower system failure.\n\nAs illustrated in Figure 6, there is a great\npotential for these high-power, advanced\ntransportation systems to provide reasonably\nfast trip times for transport within the EarthMoon system. (For example, this involves\nless than 4 months to transport payloads\nLEO to GEO, with additional time for return\nof the transport system to LEO for refueling\nand reuse.) At the heart of any decision\nwhether or not to develop these systems is\nthe as yet unresolved question of what\n\'learning curve\' to use in analyzing the\nexpected cost of such systems in operational\nproduction.\n\nWithout substantial systems-level\ninnovation and the development of tractable,\nbut as yet un-demonstrated new\ntechnologies, a broad range of ambitious\nspace operations beyond low Earth orbit\ncannot become either affordable or\nsustainable.\n\nHowever, if the relevant technologies can be\nmatured , and the systems developed\nsuccessfully, the prospective space mission\napplications are remarkably broad. In the\nnearer term, they include Ealth system\ntransportation , as illustrated in Figure 7;\nwhile in the longer-term applications include\ncargo (and even perhaps crew)\ntransportation across the illustration, as\nillustrated in Figure 8.\n\nModular, reconfigurable spacecraft,\nassembled in orbit from identical buildingblock components, is a critical capability\n\nAll in all , the MRHE spacecraft concept\naddresses many highly attractive features in\na robust, scalable package. It promises at\n\nSummary and Conclusions\n\n-6-\n\nleast one potential solution to an otherwise\ninsurmountable barrier: how to achieve\naffordable and sustainable ambitious future\nspace operations beyond low Earth orbit.\n\nGlossary of Acronyms\n\nCER\nEELV\n\nCost Estimating Relationship\nEvolved Expendable Launch\nVehicle\nETO\nEarth-to-Orbit (Transportation)\nFTE\nFull Time Equivalent\nGeostationary Earth Orbit\nGEO\nHLLV Heavy-Lift Launch Vehicle\nInternational Space Station\nISS\nkW\nkilowatt\nkWh\nkilowatt-hours\nLow Earth Orbit\nLEO\nMEO Middle Earth Orbit\nMRHE Modular Reconfigurable High\nEnergy (System)\nNASA National Aeronautics and Space\nAdministration\nPower Delivery System\nPDS\nPMAD Power Management and\nDistribution\nR&D Research and Development\nSolar Electric Propulsion\nSEP\nSolar Power Generation\nSPG\nTerrestrial Planet Imager\nTPI\nTechnology Readiness Level(s)\nTRL\n\n-7-\n\nSun toward viewer.\n\nFigure 1.\n\nA Linear / Gravity Gradient Configuration Modular Reconfigurable HighEnergy (MRHE) Concept\n\nRobotic Arm\n\nPaytoad\n\nModule Bus (woi:leciric Thruster)\n\nFigure 2.\n\nA Tetrahedral / 3-Axis Stabilized Configuration Modular Reconfigurable\nHigh-Energy (MRHE) Concept\n\n-8-\n\n--------- - -\n\n-- ~\n\n~- ---\n\n-\n\nNon-power-conducting\nroll rings on docking module\n(top) and lower side of "popout"\nSix 2.Sm x Sm SLASR\npanels In 2 arrays are\nmounted on a "pop-out"\nunit offset by a boom from\nthe SIC.
