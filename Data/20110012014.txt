b'Unusual ISS Rate Signiture.\nMichael R. Laible\nBoeing, International Space Station, Loads and Dynamics\n13100 Space Center Blvd\nHouston, TX 77059\nOn November 23, 2011 International Space Station Guidance, Navigation, and Control\nreported unusual pitch rate disturbance. These disturbances were an order of magnitude\ngreater than nominal rates. The Loads and Dynamics team was asked to review and\nanalyze current accelerometer data to investigate this disturbance.\nThis paper will cover the investigation process under taken by the Loads and Dynamics\ngroup. It will detail the accelerometers used and analysis performed. The analysis\nincluded performing Frequency Fourier Transform of the data to identify the mode of\ninterest. This frequency data is then reviewed with modal analysis of the ISS system\nmodel. Once this analysis is complete and the disturbance quantified, a forcing function\nwas produced to replicate the disturbance. This allows the Loads and Dynamics team\ntoreport the load limit values for the 100\xe2\x80\x99s of interfaces on the ISS.\n\n'
