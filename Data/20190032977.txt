b'Ames Strategic Partnerships Office\nNASA engages in partnerships with international, intergovernmental,\nacademia, industrial, and entrepreneurial communities, recognizing them\nas important contributors of skill and creativity to NASA\xe2\x80\x99s missions and\nstrategic objectives. NASA Ames Strategic Partnerships Office provides\nCenter-level strategic policy and procedural guidance for all unclassified\npartnerships.\nThe three branches of the Ames Strategic Partnership Office are:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t Office of Strategic Agreements at Ames\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t Technology Transfer Program\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t Small Business Innovation Research/ Small Business Technology\nTransfer (SBIR/STTR) Programs\nEach branch is designed to meet specific needs for our partners.The\nOffice of Strategic Agreements at Ames facilitates partnerships that\nadvance aerospace research, technology, and development through\nreimbursable or nonreimbursalbe agreements. This includes supporting\nthe NASA HQ Office of International and Intergovernmental Relations\n(OIIR) Office with facilitating the exchange and engagement with International Partners.The Technology Transfer Program allows NASA-owned\ntechnology and software developed for space exploration and aeronautics\nmissions to be licensed commercially for innovations to create new products, stimulate job growth and increase U.S. competitiveness.The SBIR/\nSTTR Programs fund Small Businesses for the research, development,\nand demonstration of innovative technologies that fulfill NASA needs and\nhave significant potential for successful commercialization.\n\nMore information on the Ames Strategic Partnerships Office at\nwww.nasa.gov/ames/partnerships\n\nAmes Core Capabilities\nEntry systems\nAdvanced Computing and IT Systems\nAerosciences\nAir Traffic Management\nAstrobiology and Space Biology\nCost-Effective Space Missions\nIntelligent/Adaptive Systems\nSpace and Earth Science\n\nOffice of Strategic Agreements at Ames\n\nVision\n\nTo advance innovative research in aerospace, technology, and science.\n\nHow to Partner with NASA\nInitiating the Partnerships process is as easy as matching your organization\xe2\x80\x99s needs to Ames\xe2\x80\x99 capabilites and contacting the Strategic Agreements\nat Ames office to explore your needs with an Agreements Manager.\n\nAgreements\nAgreements formalize mutually-beneficial collaborations, as well as \t\nreimbursable arrangements with industry, academia, non-profit organizations, and other government agencies. The Office of Strategic Agreements\nat Ames office helps form these agreements.\n\nTypes of Agreements\nNonreimburable:\n\nReimbursable:\n\nMutually-beneficial, no funds\nexchanged, & each partner bears\nthe cost of its participation.\n\nPartner pays NASA to provide\na unique service or access to a\nunique facility.\n\nFor more information on agreement types, visit:\nwww.nasa.gov/ames/strategicagreements\n\nInterested in entering a collaborative partnership with NASA?\nContact us at ARC-Partnerships@mail.nasa.gov\n\nExamples of Agreements\nRecent examples of how Ames uses partnerships to support\nthe Agency\xe2\x80\x99s missions and programs, include:\nAddress critical problems such as air traffic\ncapacity and the environmental effects of air\ntraffic to safely enable the next generation of\nair transportation.\nAmes partnered with Uber Technologies Inc. to\ndevelop an Urban Air Mobility (UAM) system that\ncould revolutionize the way people and cargo\nmove in our cities. This could take the flying cars\nconcept to the next level!\nEncourage a robust commercial space industry\nby leveraging partnerships with the U.S.\ncommercial space sector to lower launch costs\nand create more opportunities for commercial\nspace flight.\nAmes partnered with Stratolaunch to support\ndevelopment of their low cost, reusable space\ntransportation systems specifically in the areas of\naerothermal analysis and thermal protection systems. Ames has provided similar support to nearly\nall of the commercial space companies currently\ndesigning cargo and crew reentry vehicles to support ISS and other near-Earth exploration.\nExchange mutually beneficial knowledge and\ninformation to spur innovation and incentivize\nthe creation of new markets while supporting\nNASA science and technology goals.\nAmes partnered with Google to test a new quantum processor on real-world problems that cannot\nbe solved by classic supercomputers.
