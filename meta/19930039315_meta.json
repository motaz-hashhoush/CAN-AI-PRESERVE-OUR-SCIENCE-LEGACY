At the NASA STI Program's Center for AeroSpace Information (CASI), we are focused on using continuous improvements techniques to enrich today's services and products and to ensure that tomorrow's technology supports the TQM-based improvement of future STI program products and services. The Continuous Improvements Program at CASI is the foundation for Total Quality Management in products and services. The focus is customer-driven; its goal, to identify processes and procedures that can be improved and new technologies that can be integrated with the processes to gain efficiencies, provide effectiveness, and promote customer satisfaction. This Program seeks to establish quality through an iterative defect prevention approach that is based on the incorporation of standards and measurements into the processing cycle.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 19930039315, "endDate": "1993-01-14T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "AIAA"}}, "meetingId": "39181de4ef9f42de9638b3171eaeccbc", "id": "4e1c5956fcdc41939bf31ec15a9cd453"}], "name": "AIAA, Aerospace Sciences Meeting and Exhibit", "location": "Reno, NV", "id": "39181de4ef9f42de9638b3171eaeccbc", "startDate": "1993-01-11T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 19930039315, "id": "cb45b14c607a4bac8555ec11cc5f8bbe", "publicationDate": "1993-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
