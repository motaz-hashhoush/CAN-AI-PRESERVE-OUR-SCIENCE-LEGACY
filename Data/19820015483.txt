Vallotton\nNASA, Ames Research Center\n\nA new national resource that may be the world's\nunder construction at MA-Z%nes Research Center.\n\nlargest\n\ncentrifuge\n\nis\n\nThe new centrifuge will be able to take a 2700-kg (6000-pound) payload\nup to 300 G's. The 300 G's will be obtained by spinning the payload with\nits center of gravity at a radius of approximately 8.8 meters (29 feet) at\nAt this speed, the payload bucket will have a\na speed of 175 rpin.\nor roughly half the speed of\ntangential velocity of 168 m/s (550 ft/sec),\nsound. This paper describes some of the design problems encountered in\nsuch a high G-ton machine (see figures 1 and 2).\nDESCRIPTION\nThe primary purpose of the new facility\nwill be for the modeling of\nProblems such as the stability\nbody force problems in civil engineering.\nof dams ard embanlcnents, the bearing capacity of soil foundations, and the\ndynamic behavior of foundations due to vibration\nof machinery can be\nThe scope of problems that can be\nstudied using the new centrifuge.\naddressed by centrifuge modeling include: static, dynamic, thermodynamic,\nSome examples\nand fluid dynamic processes mupled with body force loading.\ninclude:\nearthquake\nresponse of earth structures,\nsoil-structure\ninteraction,\nexplosive cratering,\nblast-induced liquefaction,\nfrozen soil\nbehavior, frost heave, etc.\nThe Geotechnical Centrifuge will be used to verify\nfinite\nelement\nanalyses and help generate new theories and analytical techniques.\nThe new\nfacility,\nbecause of its large payload capacity, will be able to carry\nlarger models with greater detail than any centrifuge currently in use for\ngeotechnical mrk.\nThis will allow greater accuracy in modeling and\ninstrumentation than is currently possible with smaller centrifuge models.\nThis increase in mdeling capability will provide for a more precise study\nof currently used scaling laws, and a more accurate evaluation of the\neffects of parameters that are difficult\nor impossible to accurately scale,\nsuch as grain size of the soil. The larger model dimensions will reduce\nThe initial\nresearch effort\ninaccuracies due to model boundary effects.\nwith the new facility\nwill hopefully provide a better understanding of\nthese effects, and also provide information for the modification of scaling\nlaws to compensate for them.\n\n201\n\nThe geometric scale of a model which represents an earth structure is\ninversely proportional\nto the G-level at which the machine is operating,\nand the scaling of settling\nor consolidation\ntime is proportional\nto the\nsquare of the G-level multiplied by the time the centrifuge operates.\nFor\nexample, 40 years of time on a 300-meter section of an earthen dam can be\nsimulated usirrg a l-meter model at 300 G's in 4 hours. (see figure 3).\nOther scaling laws have been developed for vibrational\nfrequency, amplitude\nand duration for seismic events and explosive charge energy for cratering\nstudies.\nThe new facility\nand initial\nresearch is being funded by grants from\nthe National\nScience Foundation to NASA-Ames and The University\nof\nCalifornia,\nDavis. The Center for Geotechnical Modeling at The University\nDavis, will provide management and technical expertise for\nof California,\nthe operation of the new facility.\nAmes is providing the design and\nconstruction management of the facility.\nThe new centrifuge is actually a\nmodification of an obsolete Apollo-program centrifuge.\nThe main existing\ncanponents that will be used include the motor, the power supply, and the\nbuildings.\nDESIGN\nThe motor that will drive the new centrifuge\nis a large vertical\nshaft dc machine built by Westinghouse and originally\ndesigned to develop\n14,000-kW (18,8O&hp) output power for very short durations with a limited\nThe original\ndesign speed was 54 r-pm. A continuous-duty\nduty cycle.\nrating for the motor was not established in the original design.\nA recent design study by Westinghouse established a continuous-duty\npower ratin\nfor the motor of 6,700 kW (9,OOOhp). It was also determined\nthat 70 rpn would be an acceptable maximum speed at this power level,\nlimited by comnutation of the motor.\nFrequent inspection and corrmutator\nservicing muld be necessary for operation at this speed and power level.\nIt was decidd to use a speed increaser with a ratio\nthe required 175-r-m output speed for the new centrifuge,\nmaximummotor speed only slightly higher than the original\n\nof 1:3 to attain\nthus retaining a\ndesign.\n\nThe speed increaser will be an epicyclic\nconfiguration\nto maintain\nThe large ring gear will have a pitch\nconcentric input and output shafts.\ndiameter of approximately 173 cm (68 in) and a face width of 27 cm (10-S/8\nLubrication\nfor the gears and bearings is provided by spray\nin) .\nlubrication\nwith a dry sump gear case. The lubrication\noil reservoir is an\nannular ring with a 225-liter\n(60-gallon) capacity that makes up the outer\nshell of the gear case. This reservoir is kept full by a combination of\ncentrifugal\npnnping due to rotation of the gearing and a scavenge mp\nsystem.\n\n202\n\nA unique structural\ndesign feature of the centrifuge\narm is the\nThe tension straps carry the\nisolated tension straps (see figure 4).\ncentripetal\nforces of the payload directly\nfrom the payload support\nstructure\n(swing bucket) to the counterweight without going through the\nThis force [approximately 27 million\nnewtons\nmain support structure.\nof 4\n(6 million pounds), at full speed], which is equivalent to the thrust\nF-l rocket engines used on Saturn V, is all carried through pivot pins that\nallow the payload bucket to swing.

This structure also sees moderate tensile stress\ndue to centripetal\nforces from its own mass. Using mild steel for the main\nsupport structure greatly reduces the cost of construction since material\nThe tension\ncosts are less and fabrication\n(especially welding) is easier.\nstraps are attached to the main support structure by a single pin joint at\nthe payload end (see figure 5).

This\nis required for many geotechnical studies to keep ingredients, such as sand\nat-d loose soil, in place during the entire cycle, from at rest to full\nspeed.\nAnother interesting design feature is the flexwall bucket design. This\ninsures isolation of the bucket floor loading moment from the pivot pins;\nthe pins are then assured of equal loading in the bucket clevis eyes (see\nfigure 5) The walls of the swing bucket, that attach the payload-carrying\nsurface to the clevis eyes, are made from only l-inch-thick\nsteel plate.\nTherefore, they essentially act as a large flexure.\nA safety barrier to be constructed within the existing centrifuge\nbuilding was designed to be capable of containing the entire swing bucket\nwith payload at full speed, should failure occur.\nThe bucket assembly,\nwith payload, weighs about 10,000 kg (22,000 lb.), and is traveling at\na tangential speed of about 168 m/s (550 ft/sec); or in other mrds, the\nsafety barrier will be able to contain the equivalent of a ten-ton truck\n\n203\n\ntraveling at 375 miles per hour. The safety.barrier\nis an annulus with an\noutside diameter of 37 meters (122 ft).\nThe outside wall will be the\nexisting walls of the building which are 0.4-m (16-inch) thick steel\nreinforced concrete. 'An inside wall of steel reinforced cinder blocks\nwill retain 6.7 meters (22 ft) of sand fill between the walls.\nThe design\nassumes fracture or penetration of the inner wall with the sand providing\nan energy absorption role.\nModel studies have been performed on a\nballistics\nrange to verify the design analysis.\nTHE CURRENT\nSTATUS THIS PROGRAM\nOF\nThe contractor for the centrifuge construction is March Metalfab, Inc.,\nof Hayward, California.\nPhilidelphia Gear Corp. was the successful bidder\non a design-and-construct-type\ncontract for the speed increaser.\nThe\nelectrical\nand controls contract and the safety barrier contract remain to\nbe bid.\nA completed gear box is to be delivered by May 1, 1982. Concurrent with\nthis, March Metalfab will fabricate and assemble the centrifuge in their\nshop so that erection can begin as soon as the speed increaser is\nThe entire facility\nshould be operational by the end of this\ninstalled.\nyear.\n\n204\n\nL\n\nt- -----y\nmm\n--4\n\nCENTRIFUGE\n\nI\n\n7L\n\nI\n<\n\n1\n\n1\n\nCONFIGURATION\n\nI\n\nFigure\n\nr\n\nI\n\nI\n\nPERFORMANCE\n\nI\n\nI\n\nEXISTING MOTOR\n6711 KW (YOOOHPhM\nVARIABLE S.PEED\nO-60\nRPM\n\n4\n\n0 - 175 RPM\nSPEED\nACCEL.\n300 G (MAX) RAD.\nPAYLOAO 2727 KG(MAX)\n(6000 LB)\n\nCENTRWGE\n\nFigure\n\nCENTRIFUGE\n\n~.,_\n\n2\n\nPICTORIAi\n\n_-._\n\n_\n\n.-- *\n\n--y\xe2\x80\x9d&-...I.\n--\n\n.\n1 .\n\nMODELING\n.\n\n.\n\ni\n\nMODEL\n\nSCALING\nFigure\n\nLAWS\n3 207\n\nCENTRIFUGE\n\nFiclure\n\n4\n\nEXPLODED\n\nVIEW\n\n.\nQ\n\nCENTRIFUGE\nFigure\n\nSWING\n5\n209\n\nBUCKET\n\nNans Kunz\nNational\nAeronautics\nand Space Administration\nAmes Research Center\nMoffett\nField,\nCalifornia\n94035\n\nMr. Kunz has been working for NASA-Ames Research Center as a research engineer\nin the Research Equipment Engineering\nBranch since June 1978.\nDuring this\ntime, he has been primarily\ninvolved\nin the design of research equipment such\nas wind tunnels and aircraft\nand space flight\nhardware,\nas well as finiteelement analysis\nof the same equipment using MSC/NASTEAN.
