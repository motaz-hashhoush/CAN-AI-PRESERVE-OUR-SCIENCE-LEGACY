b'On September 27, 2007, a Delta I1 rocket carrying the Dawn spacecraft lifted off from Kennedy\nSpace Center. Part of NASAs Discovery program, the $370 million Dawn mission began its\nthree-billion-mile voyage to the asteroid belt to study the asteroid Vesta and Ceres, a dwarf planet.\nThe spacecraft is scheduled to reach Vesta in 2011. After spending nine months measuring the\ncomposition, shape, and topography of that body, it will travel a billion miles to carry out a similar\nanalysis of Ceres in 2015.\nAs manager of NASA\'s Discovery and New Frontiers program\nat Marshall Space Flight Center, I had oversight responsibility\nfor Dawn, which the Jet Propulsion Laboratory UPL) was\nmanaging while developing the spacecraft with Orbital Sciences\nCorporation. Over the years, Marshall has had a reputation\nfor taking a command-and-control approach to program and\nproject management: tell the project institutions or contractors\n\nwhat to do and, to a large extent, how to do it-end of story.\nWhen we formulated the Discovery and New Frontiers\nprogram, however, we decided to take a different tack. All\nour projects were developed either by JPL or Johns Hopkins\nUniversity\'s Applied Physics Laboratory (APL). We knew these\norganizationsactually knew what to do and how to do it. While\nthe responsibility for mission development lies squarely with the\n\nproject, we in the program office could make real contributions\nto problem solving and decision making, and we could bring\ntechnical expertise to bear when needed. We would not impose\nMarshall\'s specific set of "how-to" rules on them. Instead, we\nwanted to focus our energies almost entirely on enabling and\nsupporting the success of these project teams.\nWe strove for trust and mutual respect, not control. It\nwas an uphill battle at first, and there were some folks who\nfrankly just didn\'t trust our intentions. It took six months of\ndemonstrating by our actions that we really were committed to\nthis approach and were there to help. We had to earn their trust.\nI distinctly remember the day I knew the approach had worked.\nI walked into my office and found a yellow sticky note on my\ndesk: Charles Elachi, director of JPL, wanted to talk to me. I\npicked up the phone and returned his call. He explained he had\nbeen a skeptic about the Discovery Program Office, but he had\nbeen won over by numerous reports from his staff and project\nmanagers that the office had helped them in some way.\nTrust and cooperation build on each other; genuine\ncooperation creates more trust, which leads to more cooperation.\nSeveral months after that conversation, when APL ran into a\nlate-breaking problem with their autonomy system on the New\nHorizons project (the onboard system for handling anomalies\nindependent of instructions from mission operations), JPL\noffered up one of their most senior directors to lend a hand. He\ntraveled to APL and stayed there for three weeks, rolled up his\nsleeves, and helped them solve the problem.\n\nIon Propulsion\nDawn\'s long, complex journey is made possible by the spacecraft\'s\nextremely efficient, futuristic ion propulsion system. Xenon ions\nexpelled at high speed provide thrust. Their speed is high-about\n25 miles per second-but their mass is low, so the amount of\nthrust is miniscule compared with conventional rocket engines. It\nis about the same force as that applied by a single sheet of typing\npaper resting on your hand. At full throttle, it would take one of\nDawn\'s three ion engines four days to acceleratethe spacecraft from\n0 to 60 miles per hour. But the engines can operate for extremely\nlong periods of time. (They are expected to fire for more than\nfive years over the course of the mission.) One of Dawn\'s engines\noperating continuously for one year uses only fifteen gallons of\nfuel to increase the spacecraft\'s speed by 5,500 miles per hour.\n\nArtist concept of the Dawn spacecraft after launch.\n\nDeep Space 1, launched in 1998, was the first and only\nother NASA mission to use ion propulsion, so there were still\ntechnological and developmentalhurdles to overcome for Dawn.\nDeveloping the system presented several engineering challenges\nthat were also management challenges. One of the engineering\nchallenges facing the JPL engineers working on Dawn was to\nunderstand the behavior ofthe nearly 1,000 pounds ofxenon the\nengines required when the Delta 11 rocket\'s third stage spun.\nMost spacecraft do not have difficulty sensing post-separation\nspin rates while the propellant and spacecraft are exchanging\nangular momentum. For Dawn, however, the heritage gyros\nof the spacecraft attitude control system saturated at too low\na spin rate for this problem. Since a significant fraction of the\nflight system\'s moment of inertia was in the xenon propellant,\nand given the low-saturation rate of the gyros, it was critical\nto mission success to understand the xenon spin behavior. If\nthe attitude control system was activated while the gyros were\nsaturated, the hydrazine propellant needed for the mission\nwould have been expended in the first minutes of the mission,\nresulting in mission failure.\nJPL engineers had no previous relevant experience to help\nthem understand the potential problem. Success came from\nnot simply identifying and assigning blame for the problem\nor taking control of it away from the group trying to solve it,\nbut instead from focusing on how to help them succeed. The\nDiscovery Program office immediately-offered engineers at\nMarshall a number of lessons about propellant slosh dynamics of\nsuperfluid helium learned while working on the Gravity Probe B\nproject. This gave JPL engineers the support they needed to\ndevelop analysis and test techniques to resolve the problem.\nLater, the xenon tank failed during qualification testing.\nThe failure occurred just below the qualifying pressure,\nthough-significantly higher than the nominal operating\npressure. Focusing on the goal of mission success rather than\nthe letter of the law of requirements, the Discovery Program\nOffice gabbed pressure vessel experts and worked alongside the\nproject to develop the recommendations and rationale to lower\nthe operating pressure while maintaining mission performance\n>\n\nrequirements. This avoided the significant delay and expense\nredesigning, rebuilding, and requalifying the tank, which was\nalready installed on the vehicle, would have caused.\n\nLaunch Delays\nAfter a couple other assignments, I rejoined Dawn as deputy\nassociate administrator for programs in NASA Headquarters\'\nScience Mission Directorate. In this role, I chaired the Program\nManagementCouncil (PMC) that provided the recommendation\nto the associate administrator to proceed with final launch\npreparations. Dawn was scheduled for launch between June 20\nand July 10, 2007, which, from four months out, seemed a\nreasonably generous launch window. Consequently, I was bullish\non our ability to launch in this timeframe. After the PMC, I put\nout a press release announcing that we were "full steam ahead."\nBut as always seems to be the case, Murphy was right, and we\nlearned the hard way how seemingly minor circumstances and\ndelays can cascade into major problems. It\'s like the old saying:\n"For want of a nail, the shoe was lost; for want of a shoe, the horse\nwas lost; for want of a horse, the rider was lost ..." and so on.\nIn Dawn\'s case, what seemed like a relatively benign tenday slip in the delivery of the second stage fuel tank cascaded\ninto what Steve Francois, the Launch Services Program manager\nat Kennedy Space Center, called "the perfect storm." What\nhappened?Here\'s a sampling.\nThe P3 Orion surveillance aircraft, which was ready\nto provide telemetry during the original launch period, had\nanother commitment during the new launch window dates. We\npurchased the services of a navy ship that could sail to the eastern\nAtlantic to receive the telemetry, but it had mechanical problems,\nran into twelve-foot sea swells and unfavorable ocean currents,\nand failed to get to the location on schedule. We ordered up\nyet another telemetry aircraft, Big Crow, which also developed\nmechanical problems and could not get to its deployment\nstation. We encountered a crane failure from a simple bearing\nthat cost another week. Then there was the weather.\nIn July at the Cape it\'s common for afternoon thunderstorms\nto develop and force transportation and fueling delays. We\n\nASK MAGAZINE\n\n1 15\n\nAt Astrotech, workers check the Dawn spacecraft after testing the deployment\nof its more than 32-foot-long solarpanels on one side.\n\nencountered a stationaryweather front that sat on us for several\nweeks. Our slipping schedule began to impinge on the planned\nlaunch date for Phoenix, cutting into the time required between\nlaunches. SincePhoenix was aMars mission, missing their launch\nwindow would cause an unacceptable two-year delay and cost\nhundreds of millions of dollars, so their schedule needed to take\npriority over ours. As we neared the fish-or-cut-bait point, the\nfrequency and intensity of discussions increased dramatically.\nThe odds were increasingly against successfully launching both\nDawn and Phoenix within their windows. Discussions were\nelevated to the highest levels in the Agency, and our governance\nmodel was once again tested when there was disagreement as to\nwhether the requirements for telemetry could be waived entirely.\nThe right decision was made in the end, but it was a tough call.\nWhen the dust from "the perfect storm" settled, we ended up\nslipping the launch to a new window several months down the\nroad at a cost of more than $25 million.\nI drew two conclusions from this experience. One is a\nreinforcement of the need to maintain vigilance in examining\nthe potential downstream repercussions of seemingly small\nissues. The other is that it is important to know when to fold \'em.\nYou need to look at your situation realistically and objectively\nassess the risks without personal bias. When circumstances\ndemand it, give up the effort to launch at the earliest possible\ndate, as hard as that is to do and as much as that may feel like\na failure. Temporarily standing down the Dawn launch was a\ntough decision, but it was the right one.\n\nquality and success. Emphasize commander\'s intent over\nrudder control; let them know where you want to go and\nwhen you want to be there, then let them figure out how\nto get there.\nOpen and honest discussion of issues is essential. People fill\nthe void of the unknown with their worst fears. Get folks\naround the table and have open, honest, and frank dialogue.\nI\'ve seldom seen this fail to get to the root of issues.\nYou have to earn your seat at the table, proving that you\nare competent, trustworthy, and dedicated to the success\nof the mission.\nKnow when to fold \'em. Your pride can get rolled up in\nmaking a milestone or launch date, but you have to make\na judgment based on the realities of the situation and\nnot wear down the team trying to meet an increasingly\nimpossible deadline.\nThe NASA governance model that gives a voice to the\nconcerns of engineers and safety experts works-trust it\nand use it.\n\nSuccessful Launch\nDawn finally launched successfully-at\ndawn-on\nSeptember 27, 2007. By November 14, while the spacecraft\ntraveled away from Earth, controllers at JPL completed testing\nthe ion propulsion system. The craft began long-term thrusting\nfor its interplanetary travels in mid-December and will reach\nVesta in a little fewer than four years.\n\nThe Important Lessons\nThe demands of Dawn and other challenging missions I\'ve\nbeen involved with have taught me some important lessons\nfor successful program and project management. As far as I\'m\nconcerned, these are the main ones:\nProgram management, particularly of uncoupled and\nloosely coupled projects, should be more about enabling\nthan\nYou\'re working with motivated, highperforming teams and institutions with a track record of\n\nTODD MAY is the deputy assoc~ate\nadministrator of the Science\nMission Directorate, located at NASA Headquarters.
