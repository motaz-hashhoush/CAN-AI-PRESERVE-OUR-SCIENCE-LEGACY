b'Planetary Defence Activities Beyond NASA and ESA\nBrent W. Barbee\n1. Introduction\nThe collision of a significant asteroid or comet with Earth represents a singular natural disaster for a\nmyriad of reasons, including: its extraterrestrial origin; the fact that it is perhaps the only natural disaster that is\npreventable in many cases, given sufficient preparation and warning; its scope, which ranges from damaging a\ncity to an extinction-level event; and the duality of asteroids and comets themselves---they are grave potential\nthreats, but are also tantalising scientific clues to our ancient past and resources with which we may one day\nbuild a prosperous spacefaring future.\nAccordingly, the problems of developing the means to interact with asteroids and comets for purposes\nof defence, scientific study, exploration, and resource utilisation have grown in importance over the past several\ndecades. Since the 1980s, more and more asteroids and comets (especially the former) have been discovered,\nradically changing our picture of the solar system. At the beginning of the year 1980, approximately 9,000\nasteroids were known to exist. By the beginning of 2001, that number had risen to approximately 125,000 thanks\nto the Earth-based telescopic survey efforts of the era, particularly the emergence of modern automated\ntelescopic search systems, pioneered by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\xe2\x80\x99s (MIT\xe2\x80\x99s) LINEAR system\nin the mid-to-late 1990s.1 Today, in late 2019, about 840,000 asteroids have been discovered,2 with more and\nmore being found every week, month, and year. Of those, approximately 21,400 are categorised as near-Earth\nasteroids (NEAs), 2,000 of which are categorised as Potentially Hazardous Asteroids (PHAs)3 and 2,749 of\nwhich are categorised as potentially accessible.4\nThe hazards posed to us by asteroids affect people everywhere around the world. As well, the\nopportunities presented by asteroids may benefit our entire species. Thus, with such a large number of currently\nknown asteroids and so many yet to be discovered, it is not surprising that individuals, organisations, institutions,\nand governments all around the world have become interested in the study of asteroids. Indeed, a variety of\n1\n\nScott Manley, \xe2\x80\x98Asteroid Discovery - 1970-2015 - 8K resolution\xe2\x80\x99 (YouTube, 24 September 2015)\n<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BKKg4lZ_o-Y> accessed 2 December 2019\n2\n\xe2\x80\x98JPL Small-Body Database Search Engine\xe2\x80\x99 <https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/sbdb_query.cgi> accessed 2 December 2019\n3\n\xe2\x80\x98Discovery Statistics\xe2\x80\x99 <https://cneos.jpl.nasa.gov/stats/totals.html> accessed 8 November 2019\n4\n\xe2\x80\x98Accessible NEAs\xe2\x80\x99 <https://cneos.jpl.nasa.gov/nhats/> accessed 8 November 2019; Note that NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Near-Earth\nObject Human Space Flight Accessible Targets Study (NHATS) uses a set of spacecraft mission design criteria for\ncategorising NEAs as \xe2\x80\x9cNHATS-compliant.\xe2\x80\x9d i.e., \xe2\x80\x9cpotentially accessible.\xe2\x80\x9d These criteria are documented at\n<https://cneos.jpl.nasa.gov/nhats/caveats.html> accessed 26 December 2019, which include that the NEA must offer\nat least one round-trip mission opportunity between 2020 and 2045 for which the total propulsive change-in-velocity\nrequired is \xc2\xa312 km/s, the Earth departure \xe2\x80\x98characteristic energy\xe2\x80\x99 (typically denoted as \xe2\x80\x98C3\xe2\x80\x99) is \xc2\xa360 km2/s2, the roundtrip mission duration is \xc2\xa3450 days, at least 8 days are spent rendezvoused with the NEA, and the Earth return\natmospheric entry speed (propulsively controlled when necessary) is \xc2\xa312 km/s.\n1\n\ngovernment space agencies, private organisations, and individuals have worked on developing the means by\nwhich to observe, study, and even interact with asteroids and comets for purposes including science, exploration,\npioneering, commerce, and planetary defence. This includes significant individual contributions by amateur\nasteroid astronomers all over the world. International cooperation in planetary defence within the contexts of the\nUnited Nations and the International Asteroid Warning Network (IAWN) are discussed in Chapter 2, and the\nactivities undertaken by the world\xe2\x80\x99s larger space agencies, ESA and NASA, are discussed in Chapters 3 and 4.\nBut, what of the other agencies and institutions around the world who are also working on the problem of defence\nagainst hazardous asteroids and comets, or related topics? In this chapter we provide an overview, in alphabetical\norder, of some of the planetary defence related efforts that have been undertaken around the world beyond the\nactivities at the United Nations, NASA, and ESA.\n2. B612 Foundation\nThe B612 Foundation is a private non-profit foundation (501(c)(3) organisation) whose headquarters is\nlocated in Mill Valley, California, USA. B612 was founded in 2002 by Ed Lu, Rusty Schweickart, Piet Hut, and\nClark Chapman, with the goal of \xe2\x80\x9csignificantly altering the orbit of an asteroid in a controlled manner.\xe2\x80\x9d The\nfoundation is named after the asteroid lived on by the main character of the 1943 novella entitled The Little\nPrince. B612 has previously advocated for increased NASA funding to enable completion of the search for\npotentially hazardous near-Earth objects (NEOs) and worked to help motivate and organise international\nplanetary defence preparedness efforts. In 2012, ten years after its founding, B612 began attempting to raise\nprivate donation funding to deploy an infrared space-based NEO survey telescope mission named Sentinel.5 The\nmission was originally planned to launch in 2017 or 2018, but by 2015 efforts to raise funds for the mission were\nfalling short of the needed funding milestones.6 As a result, B612 decided to end development of Sentinel.\nAfter discontinuing Sentinel development, B612 began studying the use of the synthetic tracking\ntechnique deployed on multiple smaller telescope spacecraft as an alternative concept to the more traditional\nsingle, large telescope spacecraft.7 The foundation\xe2\x80\x99s focus then shifted to algorithm development and data\nanalysis, and those efforts continue as of the time of this writing. In 2018, B612 announced the consolidation of\ntheir research efforts under the Asteroid Institute, a virtual organisation collaborating with the Data Intensive\n5\n\nDebra Werner, \xe2\x80\x98Group Raising Funds for Telescope To Detect Deadly Asteroids\xe2\x80\x99 (SpaceNews 9 July 2012) <\nhttps://spacenews.com/group-raising-funds-telescope-detect-deadly-asteroids/> accessed 21 November 2019; Note\nthat Sentinel was intended to be an infrared space-based NEO survey telescope placed in a \xe2\x80\x98Venus-trailing\xe2\x80\x99 or\n\xe2\x80\x98Venus-like\xe2\x80\x99 orbit, i.e., an orbit around the Sun similar to Venus\xe2\x80\x99 orbit, but with the spacecraft not located near\nVenus itself.\n6\nTraci Watson, \xe2\x80\x98Private asteroid hunt lacks cash to spy threats in orbit\xe2\x80\x99 (Nature 19 June 2015)\n<https://www.nature.com/news/private-asteroid-hunt-lacks-cash-to-spy-threats-in-orbit-1.17810> accessed 21\nNovember 2019\n7\nJeff Foust, \xe2\x80\x98B612 studying smallsat missions to search for near Earth objects\xe2\x80\x99 (Spacenews, 20 June 2017) <\nhttps://spacenews.com/b612-studying-smallsat-missions-to-search-for-near-earth-objects/> accessed 21 November\n2019\n2\n\nResearch in Astrophysics and Cosmology Center (DIRAC) at the Department of Astronomy of the University\nof Washington.8 One of their analysis projects is the Asteroid Decision Analysis Machine (ADAM), the goal of\nwhich is to improve abilities to make decisions on potential asteroid threats.\n3. Canada\nThe Canadian Space Agency (CSA) and Defence Research and Development Canada (DRDC) funded\nthe development and launch of a small Canadian spacecraft named NEOSSat (Near Earth Object Surveillance\nSatellite).9 NEOSSat was originally scheduled to launch in 2007, but the launch was delayed until February of\n2013. The goal of the 74 kg spacecraft was the detection of NEOs, particularly those with orbits largely or\nentirely interior to Earth\xe2\x80\x99s orbit around the Sun.\nHowever, various problems that included issues with the electrical system, camera control software, and\npointing stability systems degraded the quality of images produced by the spacecraft, which prevented it from\nbeing able to carry out its planned NEO detection mission.10 The issues preventing NEOSSat from operating as\nintended are detailed in the report of an audit conducted by the CSA\xe2\x80\x99s Audit and Evaluation Directorate, which\nwas published in early 2014.11\n4. China (CNSA)\n4.1 Chang\'e 2 Flyby of Potentially Hazardous Near-Earth Asteroid 4179 Toutatis (1989 AC)\nThe China National Space Administration (CNSA) launched the Chang\xe2\x80\x99e 2 spacecraft on October 1st,\n2010, after which it proceeded to enter orbit around the Moon and begin mapping the lunar surface. The\nspacecraft\xe2\x80\x99s primary mission objectives were completed by November of 2010, and detailed lunar surface maps\nconstructed using data collected by the spacecraft were published during the months and years that followed.\nMeanwhile, the spacecraft was directed to depart lunar orbit in June 2011 and travel to the Sun-Earth Lagrange\npoint 2 (SEL2), where it arrived in August 2011. In doing so, it became the first spacecraft ever to travel directly\nfrom lunar orbit to SEL2. Chang\xe2\x80\x99e 2 was then directed to depart SEL2 in April of 2012 and proceed to a flyby\n\n8\n\n\xe2\x80\x98B612 Annual Progress Report 2018\xe2\x80\x99 <https://b612foundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/2018-B612Annual-Progress-Report.pdf> accessed 21 November 2019\n9\n\xe2\x80\x98NEOSSat: Canada\xe2\x80\x99s Sentinel in the Sky\xe2\x80\x99 <http://www.asc-csa.gc.ca/eng/satellites/neossat/> accessed 21\nNovember 2019\n10\nJordan Press, \xe2\x80\x98Asteroid-tracking satellite not up to the job: review\xe2\x80\x99 (Ottawa Citizen, 6 July 2014)\n<https://ottawacitizen.com/news/national/asteroid-tracking-satellite-not-up-to-the-job-review> accessed 21\nNovember 2019\n11\nCanadian Space Agency, Evaluation of the Near Earth Object Surveillance Satellite (NEOSSat) Project For\nthe period from February 2005 to December 2013, Project # 13/14 02-02, Prepared by the Audit and\nEvaluation Directorate, February 2014\n3\n\nof the PHA 4179 Toutatis (1989 AC) on December 13th, 2012, when the asteroid was approximately 7 million\nkm from Earth.\nToutatis is categorised as a PHA due to its Earth minimum orbit intersection distance (MOID) of 0.0064\nau (astronomical units; 1 au is the mean distance of Earth from the Sun, 149,597,870.7 km). The asteroid has a\nheliocentric orbit semi-major axis of 2.543 au, eccentricity of 0.626, and inclination of 0.44\xc2\xb0. Its absolute\nmagnitude is 15.3 and its albedo is 0.405, which together suggest an approximate diameter of 1,800 m. By\ncontrast, planetary radar observations revealed that Toutatis is rather irregularly shaped, with dynamically\nequivalent, equal volume ellipsoid dimensions of 1,700 m \xc2\xb4 2,030 m \xc2\xb4 4,260 m. Lightcurve observations show\nits rotation period to be 176 hours.12 Thus, Toutatis serves as a good example of how challenging it can be to\nassess an asteroid\xe2\x80\x99s true shape and size without radar imagery and/or close proximity imaging via spacecraft.\nThe Chang\xe2\x80\x99e 2 spacecraft passed within 3.2 km of Toutatis at a relative velocity of 10.73 km/s and\ncollected images of the asteroid at approximately 10 meter per pixel resolution. The spacecraft imagery was later\ncompared to the radar-derived shape model of Toutatis, revealing some small but interesting differences between\nthe radar-derived shape model and the actual asteroid shape shown in the spacecraft camera images.13 With the\ncompletion of the Toutatis flyby, China became the fourth spaceflight-capable nation to deploy a successful\nmission to an asteroid, following NASA, ESA, and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA).\n4.2 Potential Mission to 469219 Kamo`oalewa (2016 HO3)\nIn April of 2019, CNSA announced a concept for a ten-year mission named ZhengHe, which would\nlaunch in 2022 or 2024 to collect and return samples of the NEA 469219 Kamo\xe2\x80\x99oalewa (2016 HO3), which is\nalso categorised as an Earth quasi-satellite. Although not captured by the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s gravity, the asteroid makes\ndistant repeating loops around the Earth when viewed in a frame of reference that moves with Earth along its\norbit around the Sun. The repeating loop-like motion around Earth, which occurs well beyond the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s\ngravitational sphere of influence, is due to the nature of the relative motion between the Earth and the asteroid\nas they move independently around the Sun.\nKamo\xe2\x80\x99oalewa has an Earth MOID of 0.0333 au, which meets the PHA Earth MOID criterion of less\nthan or equal to 0.05 au. However, the asteroid is not technically categorised as a PHA because its absolute\nmagnitude of 24.3 does not meet the PHA criterion of absolute magnitude less than or equal to 22.0. An absolute\nmagnitude less than or equal to 22 corresponds to an approximate physical size of 140 m or larger, assuming an\nalbedo (surface reflectivity) of approximately 14%. The asteroid has a heliocentric orbit semi-major axis of\n1.0011 au, eccentricity of 0.1035, and inclination of 7.78\xc2\xb0. Its absolute magnitude suggests that its approximate\n12\n\n\'4179 Toutatis (1989 AC)\' (Jet Propulsion Laboratory Small-Body Database Browser)\n<https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/sbdb.cgi?sstr=Toutatis> accessed 25 November 2019\n13\nXiaoduan Zou, et al., \xe2\x80\x98The preliminary analysis of the 4179 Toutatis snapshots of the Chang\xe2\x80\x99E-2 flyby,\xe2\x80\x99\nIcarus, Volume 229, Feb 2014, pp. 348\xe2\x80\x93354\n4\n\nsize should be between 23 m and 105 m, depending on how reflective the asteroid\xe2\x80\x99s surface is. Lightcurve\nobservations show its rotation period to be 0.476 hours.14\nAfter collecting samples from Kamo\xe2\x80\x99oalewa and returning them to Earth, the ZhengHe spacecraft would\nthen proceed to the main asteroid belt region beyond the orbit of Mars, where it would visit and study the object\n7968 Elst-Pizarro, which is categorised as both an asteroid (due to its orbital location within the solar system)\nand a comet (due to its display of a cometary dust tail when near perihelion). As with most missions to asteroids\nor comets, the goals of ZhengHe would include studying the compositions and origins of the solar system, as\nwell as the origins of life on Earth.15 As of the time of this writing, the Chinese government has not yet formally\napproved the ZhengHe mission.\n5. Denmark\nA group called the Emergency Asteroid Defence Project (EADP) formed in Denmark circa 2015, with\nthe goal of crowdfunding a standing NEO deflection system based on the Hypervelocity Asteroid Intercept\nVehicle (HAIV) concept.16 The HAIV concept was developed by Professor Bong Wie and his graduate students\nat the Asteroid Deflection Research Collaboration (ADRC), located in the Department of Aerospace Engineering\nat Iowa State University. The EADP website17 does not appear to have been updated since 2015, and there are\nno indications that the project was able to move forward. Their Indiegogo crowdfunding website for collecting\ndonations indicates that they were able to raise $8,834 USD, from 187 donors (\xe2\x80\x9cbackers\xe2\x80\x9d), towards their original\ngoal of $200,000 USD.18\nThe EADP concept of collecting private donations to fund a non-governmental planetary defence related\ninitiative is unique thus far, with only the B612 Foundation\xe2\x80\x99s attempt to fund an NEO survey telescope using\nprivate donations being comparable. The inability of either the EADP or B612 efforts to ultimately fund their\nmissions and bring them to fruition suggests that planetary defence mission activities will remain the province\nof governments, at least for the time being. However, the fact that some donor funds were able to be raised at all\nis still significant, demonstrating that some citizens are interested in planetary defence and believe that\nconducting planetary defence activities is an important and worthwhile use of resources.\n6.

The mission was originally designated Mu Space Engineering Spacecraft C\n(MUSES-C), but its name was subsequently changed to Hayabusa, which means \xe2\x80\x9cperegrine falcon\xe2\x80\x9d in Japanese.\nItokawa is categorised as a PHA due to its Earth MOID of 0.013 au. The asteroid is also relatively\naccessible for spacecraft missions, with a heliocentric orbit semi-major axis of 1.324 au, eccentricity of 0.28,\nand inclination of 1.62\xc2\xb0. Its absolute magnitude is 19.2, which suggests that its approximate size should be\nbetween 250 m and 1,100 m, depending on how reflective the asteroid\xe2\x80\x99s surface is. The Hayabusa mission\ndiscovered that Itokawa is somewhat irregularly shaped, with approximate physical dimensions of 535 m \xc2\xb4 294\nm \xc2\xb4 209 m, and that the asteroid has an average density of 1.9 g/cm3. Itokawa rotates with a period of 12.132\nhours.19\nHayabusa\xe2\x80\x99s low-thrust solar electric xenon propulsion system brought it to rendezvous with Itokawa in\nSeptember of 2005, after which the spacecraft performed station-keeping approximately 20 km from the asteroid.\nHayabusa later moved to the asteroid\xe2\x80\x99s surface for sample collection by means of firing small projectiles into\nthe asteroid\xe2\x80\x99s surface and then collecting the material kicked up by the impacts of those projectiles. However,\nthe spacecraft experienced a variety of technical problems that impeded the sample collection attempt, and only\na few tiny grains of asteroid material were actually collected.\nPrior to the spacecraft\xe2\x80\x99s collection of material from Itokawa, Hayabusa had deployed a small minilander (approximately 10 cm in size) named MINERVA, which was intended to descend to Itokawa\xe2\x80\x99s surface\nand then utilise an internal flywheel to hop between locations on the asteroid. However, errors in deployment\nresulted in MINERVA instead tumbling away into space, away from Itokawa.\nHayabusa\xe2\x80\x99s initiation of its flight back to Earth after asteroid sample collection was delayed due to\ntechnical issues with the attitude control and propulsion systems. However, the spacecraft\xe2\x80\x99s mission control\npersonnel were able to resolve those issues and the spacecraft began its journey back to Earth in April of 2007.\nHayabusa reached Earth and deployed its sample return capsule on June 13th, 2010, at which time both the\nspacecraft and sample return capsule entered the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s atmosphere. The spacecraft was destroyed by\natmospheric entry, as planned, while the sample return capsule performed a parachute landing within the\ndesignated landing zone in the Woomera Prohibited Area in South Australia, after which it was successfully\nrecovered.\n\n19\n\n\'25143 Itokawa (1998 SF36)\' (Jet Propulsion Laboratory Small-Body Database Browser)\n<https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/sbdb.cgi?sstr=Itokawa> accessed 25 November 2019\n6\n\nExamination of the capsule and its contents revealed that 1,500 grains of material, each approximately\n10 micrometres in size, had been collected from Itokawa. Although only a tiny amount of material, this would\nstill constitute the first return of asteroid material to Earth. Analyses of those samples suggest that Itokawa was\npreviously part of a larger asteroid, indicate that Itokawa\xe2\x80\x99s surface material is approximately 8 million years old,\nand show that Itokawa\xe2\x80\x99s composition matches that of an LL chondrite meteorite (largely comprised of the\nminerals pyroxene and olivine, with some iron oxide).20\n6.2 Hayabusa2\nFollowing the success of the Hayabusa mission, JAXA developed and deployed the Hayabusa2\nspacecraft to visit, study, and return samples from the PHA 162173 Ryugu (1999 JU3). Ryugu is a dark, primitive\ncarbonaceous asteroid of the rare spectral type Cg (exhibiting characteristics of both C-type and G-type\nasteroids).\nRyugu is categorised as a PHA due to its Earth MOID of 0.00063 au. The asteroid is also relatively\naccessible for spacecraft missions, with heliocentric orbit semi-major axis of 1.189 au, eccentricity of 0.19, and\ninclination of 5.88\xc2\xb0. Its absolute magnitude is 19.3, which suggests that its approximate size should be between\n240 m and 1,070 m, depending on how reflective the asteroid\xe2\x80\x99s surface is.21 The Hayabusa2 mission discovered\nthat Ryugu has a round-ish shape featuring an equatorial bulge, with approximate physical dimensions of 1040\nm \xc2\xb4 1020 m \xc2\xb4 880 m, and that the asteroid has an average density of 1.19 g/cm3, with >50% porosity.22\nThe Hayabusa2 mission launched on December 3rd, 2014 and utilised its solar electric ion thruster\npropulsion system to reach rendezvous with Ryugu on June 27th, 2018. The spacecraft spent nearly a year and\nhalf surveying Ryugu in close proximity and then collecting surface and subsurface samples. Additionally, the\nspacecraft deployed three rovers to the asteroid\xe2\x80\x99s surface, all of which operated nominally. Hayabusa2 departed\nRyugu on November 13th, 2019 and should be delivering its sample return capsule to Earth in late 2020. After\nthe sample return, the spacecraft may then be sent on an extended mission to perform flybys of other asteroids.23\n6.3 PROCYON\nPROCYON (Proximate Object Close flyby with Optical Navigation) was a small, low-cost spacecraft\nco-launched with Hayabusa2 in December of 2014.

Its heliocentric orbit semimajor axis is 1.365 au, its eccentricity is 0.376, and its inclination is 8.67\xc2\xb0. Its absolute magnitude is 18.2, which\nsuggests that its approximate size should be between 400 m and 1,800 m, depending on how reflective the\nasteroid\xe2\x80\x99s surface is. Characterisation via planetary radar revealed that 2000 DP107 is a binary asteroid system,\nwhere the primary object in the system has dimensions of 992 \xc2\xb4 938 \xc2\xb4 964 m, a bulk density of approximately\n1.365 g/cm3 (with bulk porosity likely in the range of 55--65%), and a geometric albedo of 0.137. Lightcurve\ndata indicates the primary object is rotating with a period of 2.7754 hours.24 The diameter of the secondary object\nis approximately 300 m, and the objects orbit one another with a 1.76-day period at a separation distance of\n2,600 m. Remote observations of its spectra indicate that 2000 DP107 exhibits both C-type (carbonaceous) and\nM-type (metallic) characteristics.\nPROCYON initiated the use of its ion thruster in February of 2015 to begin its journey towards 2000\nDP107. However, the ion thruster system failed in March of 2015, and contact with the spacecraft was lost in\nDecember of 2015. Prior to loss of contact, the spacecraft was able to provide observations of the hydrogen coma\nof comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko (the destination of ESA\xe2\x80\x99s Rosetta mission) and assess the rate at which\nthe comet discharges water. This constituted the first scientific observations collected by such a small spacecraft\n(~70 kg mass, ~60 cm size).25 Additionally, the spacecraft was able to collect the first complete observations of\nEarth\xe2\x80\x99s hydrogen corona, enabling the discovery of its north-south symmetry.26\n6.4 DESTINY+\nDESTINY+ (Demonstration and Experiment of Space Technology for INterplanetary voYage Phaethon\nfLyby dUSt science) is a spacecraft mission currently under development at JAXA for a 2022 launch, with the\ngoal of studying and understanding interplanetary dust and its origins.27 The spacecraft design utilises efficient\nsolar electric low-thrust ion engines and demonstrates very lightweight solar panel technology.28 As part of its\nmission profile, DESTINY+ would perform a flyby of the PHA 3200 Phaethon (1983 TB), which has been\nobserved to emit dust despite appearing to otherwise display asteroidal, rather than cometary, characteristics.\nPhaeton is categorised as a PHA due to its Earth MOID of 0.0195 au. It occupies a rather elliptical and\ninclined orbit around the Sun, with heliocentric orbit semi-major axis of 1.271 au, eccentricity of 0.89, and\n\n24\n\n\xe2\x80\x98185851 (2000 DP107)\xe2\x80\x99 (Jet Propulsion Laboratory Small-Body Database Browser)\n<https://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/sbdb.cgi?sstr=2000DP107> accessed 25 November 2019\n25\n\xe2\x80\x98Micro spacecraft investigates cometary water mystery\xe2\x80\x99 (National Astronomical Observatory of Japan, 24 Jan\n2017) <https://www.nao.ac.jp/en/news/science/2017/20170124-procyon.html> accessed 22 November 2019\n26\nShingo Kameda, et al, \'Ecliptic North\xe2\x80\x90South Symmetry of Hydrogen Geocorona\', Geophysical Research Letters,\nVol 44, Issue 23, 16 December 2017, Pages 11,706-11,712\n27\n\xe2\x80\x98DESTINY+\xe2\x80\x99 (JAXA) <https://destiny.isas.jaxa.jp/> accessed 25 November 2019\n28\nHiroyuki Toyota, et al, \xe2\x80\x98DESTINY+: Deep Space Exploration Technology Demonstrator and Explorer to Asteroid\n3200 Phaethon\xe2\x80\x99, Low-Cost Planetary Missions Conference, Pasadena, CA, August 15\xe2\x80\x9417, 2017,\n<http://www.lcpm12.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/1415-1435-Toyota.pdf> accessed 25 November 2019\n8\n\ninclination of 22.26\xc2\xb0. Its absolute magnitude is 14.6, which suggests that its approximate size should be between\n2,100 m and 9,200 m, depending on how reflective the asteroid\xe2\x80\x99s surface is. Arecibo radar observations show\nthe object\xe2\x80\x99s size to be about 6,250 m.29 Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS) observations indicate the object\xe2\x80\x99s\ngeometric albedo is 0.1066, and combining that with the aforementioned absolute magnitude yields an estimated\nsize of 4,890 m, which is within approximately 20% of the actual object size as assessed via radar. The 4,890 m\nsize estimate based on the absolute magnitude and albedo is much closer to the results of thermophysical\nmodelling, which estimated the effective diameter of the object to be 5,100 +/- 200 m.30 Lightcurve observations\nof Phaeton indicate that it rotates with a period of about 3.6 hours.31\nUnusual for an object with asteroidal properties, Phaeton is the parent body of the mid-December\nGeminids meteor shower. It is categorised as an NEA yet occupies a rather elliptical and inclined orbit that is\nmore reminiscent of a cometary orbit. As well, at times the object has appeared to be ejecting dust and/or\nexhibiting a dust tail. Thus, Phaeton seems to have a mixture of asteroidal and cometary characteristics, and is,\ntherefore, an interesting object for more detailed study.\n6.5 The Japan Spaceguard Association\nThe Japan Spaceguard Association (JGSA) is a Specified Nonprofit Corporation in Japan whose goal is\nto observe and study NEOs for the purpose of supporting defence against NEO impacts on Earth. Towards this\nend, the JGSA operates the Bisei Spaceguard Center (BSGC), which is owned by the Japan Space Forum and\nlocated near the town of Bisei (Oda District, Okayama Prefecture) in western Japan.32\nThe BSGC is an observatory facility constructed during 1999--2000 that carries out the Bisei Asteroid\nTracking Telescope for Rapid Survey (BATTeRS), which has discovered 440 minor planets as of October 2019.\nThe observatory operates a 1-meter telescope for object search, and a 0.5-meter telescope for follow-up\nobservations.33\n7.

Although\nasteroid mining is not specifically oriented towards planetary defence, the activities necessary to support and\nconduct asteroid mining are very synergistic with planetary defence objectives. Asteroid mining activities may\ninclude: telescopically searching for asteroids; characterising the orbital and physical properties of asteroids;\nsending robotic spacecraft to asteroids for resource prospecting (which would collect most, if not all, of the data\nabout the asteroid that would be desired for planetary defence related assessments); designing/testing systems\nfor manipulating asteroid material; and, eventually, sending actual mining missions to asteroids. Such activities\nwould accelerate the discovery of Earth-impacting NEOs before their Earth impact dates, and help advance\ntechnologies needed for characterising and interacting with NEOs, all of which is highly relevant to planetary\ndefence.\nThe Luxembourg Space Agency (LSA) continues to operate its \xe2\x80\x9cSpaceResources.lu Initiative,\xe2\x80\x9d the goals\nof which include ensuring \xe2\x80\x9c... that space resources explored under its jurisdiction serve a peaceful purpose, are\ngathered and used in a sustainable manner compatible with international law and for the benefit of humankind.\xe2\x80\x9d34\nAs incentives to commercial entities pursuing related activities, Luxembourg offered financial investments in\nresearch and development work, as well as tax credits. An agreement was also made with the U.S.-based\ncompany Deep Space Industries, Inc. (DSI) whereby Luxembourg would co-fund DSI\xe2\x80\x99s development of asteroid\nrendezvous spacecraft missions, for purposes of asteroid rendezvous technology demonstration as a precursor to\nresource prospecting and eventual asteroid mining.35\nHowever, those missions have yet to be brought to fruition. While LSA maintains its intentions to pursue\nasteroid resource utilisation efforts, it is worth noting that the U.S. asteroid mining companies DSI36 and\nPlanetary Resources, Inc.37 have both since been purchased by other companies for purposes other than asteroid\nmining. As such, while interest in asteroid mining remains, the status and future of such missions is unclear.\n8.

Conclusion\nHerein we have surveyed some of the more notable activities related to planetary defence taking place around\nthe world beyond the efforts at the United Nations, NASA, and ESA. Of these, the most significant are the\nHayabusa and Hayabusa2 asteroid sample return missions flown by JAXA, followed by the Chang\xe2\x80\x99e 2 flyby of\nToutatis performed by CNSA. Thus, the Japanese and Chinese space agencies are currently the two national\nspace agencies most active in planetary defence related endeavours, besides NASA and ESA. In terms of both\nflown and planned spacecraft missions, JAXA is the most active overall.\nIt is clear that planetary defence and related activities are considered to be important by various organisations\nthe world over. Additional missions to asteroids are in development, and research programs are proceeding\napace. Assuming the trend of increasing activity levels continues, we can expect to see planetary defence related\nactivities beyond those at NASA and ESA continue to expand in the years to come. We can also expect to see\nincreasing international collaboration on planetary defence and related topics. These are certainly desirable\noutcomes, as the opportunities presented by asteroids and comets may benefit our entire species and the hazards\npresented by such objects pose a threat to all the people and nations of the world.\n\n38\n\nLorien F.
