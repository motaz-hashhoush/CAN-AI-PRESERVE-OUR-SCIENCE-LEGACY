The start-up transient represents one of the most complex phenomena in the loop heat pipe operation. This paper discusses various aspects of loop heat pipe start-up behaviors. Topics include the four start-up scenarios, the initial fluid distribution between the evaporator and reservoir that determines the start-up scenario, factors that affect the fluid distribution between the evaporator and reservoir, difficulties encountered during the low power start-up, and methods to enhance the start-up success. Also addressed are the thermodynamic constraint between the evaporator and reservoir in the loop heat pipe operation, the superheat requirement for nucleate boiling, pressure spike and pressure surge during the start-up transient, and repeated cycles of loop start-up andshutdown under certain conditions.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20140005422, "endDate": "2014-03-26T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "Aerospace Corp.", "location": "El Segundo, CA, United States"}}, "meetingId": "0b54ac074eec42c4a3c1c2edd884ed0d", "id": "208f6289ee254292bf0da35af07cb408"}], "name": "Workshop on Thermophysics in Microgravity", "location": "El Segundo, CA", "id": "0b54ac074eec42c4a3c1c2edd884ed0d", "startDate": "2014-03-24T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20140005422, "id": "57719270c69c4277a88306c3899b3f3e", "publicationDate": "2014-03-24T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20140005422.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20140005422/downloads/20140005422.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20140005422/downloads/20140005422.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20140005422/downloads/20140005422.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
