INTRODUCTION\n\nThe rocket exhaust of the Interim Upper Stage (IUS) and the Spinning\nSolid Upper Stage (SSUS) contain: high velocity Al 20 3 particles. These\nparticles may impact and alter the properties of the Orbiter surfaces. The\nOrbiter surfaces of concern are the window glass (Corning 7940), hightemperature reusable surface insulation (NRSI) and low-temperature reusable\nsurface insulation (LRSI). Al 2 0 3 impacts were simulated by high velocity\ntitanium diboride particles produced in the TRW Micrometeoroid Facility.\nDetailed analysis of the craters on the test sampla surfaces will be performea at the conclus i on of the Particle Impact Tests program at NASA\nJohnson Space Center.\n\n2. EXPERIMENT APPARATUS\n\nThe particle impact tests were performed with the TRW Micrometeoro`i\nFacility, suitably modified to accept the test samples. This facility\nelectrostatically accelerates micron sized particles to high velocities\n(typically 1-50 km \xe2\x80\xa2 sec -1 ) and has been used extensively to simulate micrometeoroid impacts on material surfaces and micrometeoroid interactions with\ngaseous targets. Configuration of the numerous particle detectors and\nsupport electronics, which are a part of the facility, is determined by the\nspecific requirements of each experiment.\nA block diagram of the experiment conficuratiun used for the present\ntests is given in Figure 1. The source of microparticles is a tHO million\nvolt Van de Graaff generator, in which the high voltage terminal has been\nmodified to accept nicroparticle charging and injection equipment. I Particle charging is accomplished by electrically agitating a supply of microparticles, thereby causing some to come into contact with a small tungsten\nelectrode held at a high positive potential. Contact with the electrode\ncauses the particle to rebound witli a high positive charge and surface\nelectric field strength of ti 10 9 V - m -1 .\n\nThe rebounding particle then\n\nenters the accelerator tube of the Van de Graaff generator where it is\naccelerated by the positive potential of the generator terminal.\nThe final velocity obtained as the particles exit the Van de Graaff\n1\n\nAr.\n\n\t\n\nLn\n\n3\n\nd\nW\nW\n\n1--\n\n6\n\nf/^\\\\\\\n\nGC\nW\n\nZ\n7)\nO\n\nW\nd\n\nO\nO\nJ\n\ncc\nW\n\nJ\n>\nOC\nW CIC\nI-- O\n\nZ0,\nW W\nJ\nW\n\n1 - V1\n\nI\n\nI\ni\nI\n\n_\n\nO\n\nOC\n\nV\nW\nW\t\n\nW\n\nO\n\nQ\n\nQ\nO\n\nZ\n\nV\n\nZ\n\nJ\n\nno\nin\n\nN W\nZ\nd O\nO\n\nQ\n\nN\nOf\nW\nm\n\ni\nV\n\'W^\nV\nd\nQ\nH-\n\no[\n\nooZ 0\nQ\n\nv0Z\nJ\n\n> Z `-\n\nO\n>WV\nC4\n\n2\n\nd\n\n1-\n\n\\\n\nCN\n\nN\nw\n\nO\n\nN\nN\n\nE\n\nQ\n\nu\n\nV\nW\n\naJ\nr\n\nW\n\no\n\nI-\n\nr\n\nZ\nF-N\n\nOC\nU\n\nO an\nd\nlY\n\nce\n\n^r\n\nL\nb\nL\n\nd\n\nO\nw\n\na\nL\nQ1\n\nZ\nH\n\nO\n\n4C\n\nW\n\n^^\nZ\n\xe2\x96\xba- v,\nQ\n\n3\n\nL\nU\nf\n\nE\n\n4\n\no\naJ\n\ns-\n\n.o\n\n.0\n\nr\n\nU\n\n0\n\nQ Q\n\nW\n\nu\n\nW\nm\n\nN\n\nTRW No. 32970-6001-RO-00\n\nN\n\nCC\nLU\n\nO\nN i\n=\n\nW\n\nV\n1LLJ\t\ny\n\n()\t\n\nQ\n\ng\n\nO\n\nO Z\t `VSJ J\n\ncc\n\nLL\nW\n\nQ\n\nW\n\no\n\nW\n0\n\n=\n\nW\n\nZ\nJ\n\na 3\n\nO\n\nW\n\n^\n\nJ\n\nO\nZ\n\n^-\n\n>\nx\n\nx\n\nc^\n\n\xe2\x80\x94;\n\nO ^\n\n7\n\na\nL\n\nU-\n\nORI(JINATi PACE I3\nOF, VOOR QUALITY,\n\nTRW No. 32910-6001-RU-00\n\ngenerator is dependent upon the total accelerating potential, the particle\nmaterial, and the particle\'s geometry. The upper velocity limit is dependent upon the detector electronics which are limited by signal-to-noise\nconsiderations. For most metallic materials, or materials having volume\nresistivities less than about 10 1 ohm-cm, the size range 0.1 to 5 microns\ncan be accelerated to final velocities in the range from 1 to 50 km - sec-1.\nThe final velocity is inversely proportional to particle size with the\nhigher velocities being obtained only with the smaller particles. Particle\ninjection may be controlled over a wide range of output particle flux. At\nthe lower limits it can be made essentially a single shot device while at\nthe upper limits the output particle flux can be raised to several hundred\nper second.\nParticles exiting from the accelerator first pass through a magnet\nassembly where ions, which may have been produced by the charging process,\nare removed. A particle position detector\n\nthen provides a means for lo-\n\ncating the particle "beam" axis in order to align the system. Tile particles\nnext pass through two timing detectors, Separated a caretully measured distance, and the transit time over this distance is measured. The time separation of the two detector signals is analyzed by a TRW SystemF Model\n3212 PV2 Time Interval Se lector and Dual Proportional Delay Generator.3\nThe Time Interval Selector provides an output pulse to a particle\ndeflector when the measured transit time falls witHin the bounds of some\npredetermined time interval. Normally, with no signal applied to the input\nof the particle deflector high vcltage electronics, all particles are deflected by a bias Voltage on a pair o` parallel deflector p l ates and are\nnot allowed to continue downstream toward the experimental area. A signal\nfrom the Time Interval Selector removes the bias voltage for a time just\nsufficient to allow the selected pa r ticle to pass. The Time Interval\nSelector also triggers the particle counter which totals the number of\nvelocity selected particles.\nThe particles pass through a second position detector, which is initially\nused to align the system with the particle beam axis. During an experiment,\nthe detector output is monitored with an oscilloscope to verify that the\nselected particles can impact the target in the target chamber. In addition,\na small sampling of the detector\'s output was recorded on film for analysis\n3\n\nTRW No. 32910-6001-RU-00\n\nlater to Bete ncone particle velocity and size.\nTargets to be impacted were placed in either target chamber 1 or 2,\ndepending upon the physical size of the target. Figure 2 illustrates\ndetails of target chamber 1. Note that the holder in target chamber 1 has\nan aperture which can be positioned to allow particles to continue on to\ntarget chamber 2. Operation of target chamber 1 and 2 is very similar, in\nthat the holder in both allows the sample to be moved perpendicular to the\nbeam axis and rotated. Consequently, the impact site and impact angle can\nbe varied without removing the sample from the chamber or letting the\nchamber up to atmosphere.\n\n3. PROCEDURE\n\n3.1 MICRCPARTICLE SELECTION\nBefore bombarding the Orbiter materials a suitable supply of microparticles (preferred two size ranges: submicron and 2-5 micron sizes) had\nto be obtained. A primary requirement on the particle material was that\nit have a density very close to that of Al 2 0 3 , 3.965 g -\n\nGn -3 . Secondly,\n\nbut just as important, the material had to be compatible with the particle\ncharging process of the particle injector. From previous experiments,\noperation of the particle injector generally requires the particle material\nto have a bulk resistivity of < 10 1 ohm - cm. Finally, having selected\ncandidate materials, the commercial availability of the material in the\nparticle sizes desired was investigated.\nThe most promising material from the standpoint of compatibility with\nthe particle injector was pure titanium, with a density of 4.5 g - cm-3.\nFor particle sizes < 5 microns, the material is extremely pyrophoric and,\ntherefore, is extremely difficult to obtain. As an alternative, based\nupon the available data and the conmiercial availability, titanium dioxide\n(TiO 2 ) was obtained from Cotronics Corporation and tried in a particle\ninjector mounted on a bench test fixture. Apparently a high bulk resistivity\ncoupled with particle aglomeration (clump formation) in the particle reservo i r resulted in an inoperative injector. Several unsuccessful schemes were\nattempted to reduce surface resistivity and prevent particle aglomeration.\nAluminum oxide particles recovered from a rocket test were provided by\n4\n\nTRW No. 32910-6001-RU-00\n\nAPERTURE\n\nFigi.re 2. Isometric View of Target Chamber 1\n\n5\n\nTRW No. 32970-60(\n\nNASA-Johnson Space Center. \t\n\nIh,- bulk resistivity of triis material was\n\nsufficiently large that the particle injector would not operate.\nFinally, titanium diboride (TiB 2 ), with a den.;ity of 4.50 g - cm-3,\nwas selected and determined to function satisfactorily in the particle\ninjector. The material was obtained from Cotronics Corporation; in only the\nlarger particle size range, 2 microns.* Particles were produced by grinding\nsolid pieces of titanium diboride. Chiefly because this material is hard\n(as opposed to some solids fo rned as a precipitate from a chemical reaction),\nthe supplier opted to not deliver submicron particles. Consequently, particle impact tests could not be performed with submicron particles.\n3.2 TEST ARTICLES\nOrbiter surfaces tested were window glass (Corning 7940), high-temperature reusable surface insulation (HRSI) and low-temperature reusable surface\ninsulation (LRSI). The window glass samples were 1.0 in. diameter x 0.25 in.\nthick with a surface finish to MIL-0-13830. Twelve windows were fabricated\nfor testing by J. L. Wood Optical Systems. Two samples each of the HRSI and\nLRSI were provided by NASA-Johnson Space Center with the followfi:9 ro,rt\nnumbers:\nHRSI sample\t\n\n1. 606020-5161\n2. L606020-5238\n\nLRSI sample\t\n\n1. 500010-14359\n2. L808010-500016.\n\nSample dimensions were 6 in. square x 2 in. thick for the HRSI and 8 in.\nsquare x 1 in. thick for the LRSI. Window glass samples were tested in\ntarget chamber 1, while HRSI and LRSI samples were tested in target chamber 2.\n3.3 IMPACT SIMULATION\nThe Van de Graaff generator and particle injection equipment was tested\nand the detector array-target chamber system aligned. Particle velocity\nselection was exercised to exclude particles with velocities < 1 km \xe2\x80\xa2 sec-l.\nImpact tests were initiated on one of the glass windows to determine the\n\n*Cotronics Corp. method of sizing particles is to flow a gas through a\n"cake" of the particles and measure the pressure drop across the "cake".\nPressure drop and flow rate are then related to particle size.\n6\n\nk-\n\nTRW No. 32970-6001-RU-00\n\nrequired total particle deposition for a given focus condition of the\nparticle beam from the Van de Graaff generator. Thes. initial tests indicated a beam spot size of less than 0.12 in. (3 mm) diameter. Craters on\nthe glass surface exhibited a great deal of stall formation with disrupted\nzones extending n:i the order of ten particle .adii from the central impact\nsite. To avoid excessive overlap of the individual craters, tonal particle\ndeposition on an individual spot was held to % 1000 particles for the glass\nsamples oriented such that the impact angle is 90 0 to the surface (see\nFigure 3).\nThe glass samples were tested wherein the impact angle was 90\xc2\xb0, 60"\nand 30 0 to the sample surface. Total particle deposition for each angle\nwas as follows:\n1.\n\n90 0 - 1030 particles\n\n2.\n\n60 0 - 1030 particles\n\n3.\n\n30\xc2\xb0 -\t\n\n1413 particles.\n\nTwo additional cases were run at an impact angle of 90 0 with greater\t\n\n)city\n\nselection. Particle velocities were limited to two bands, one at r-,n\nextreme of the velocity range used on the previous test. These tests, one\nlow velocity range and one high velocity range, were performed to aid in\nquantifying the behavior of the surface as\n\nd function of particle size and\n\nvelocity. Total particle deposition for the two cases was as follows:\n1.\n\nlow velocity\t\n\n2.\n\nhigh velocity\t\n\n- 142 particles\n151 particles.\n\nDuring the conduct of the impact tests a sampling of the position detector\n2 output was recorded for later analysis.\nImpact tests on the HRSI and LRSI samples followed in much the same\nmanner as was previously described for the window glass samples. R%sponse\nof both the HRSI and LRSI surfaces to the impacting particles was very\nsimilar to the glass surface; spall formation was also observed about the\ncentral impact site. Consequently, a similar rationale was employed and\nthe total number of impacting particles for the cases of the three different\nimpact angles was limited as indicated by the following:\n\n7\n\nTRW No. 32910-6001..RU-00\n\nPARTICLE \\\nA\n\nV /\n\nn\t\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nFigure 3.

Verification\nof the impact sites was performed utilizing a metallograph and some of the\ncraters photographed at a magnification of 400X. These photographs will\nbe presented in the following section.\n\n4. RESULTS AND ANALYSIS\n\n4.1\t\n\nIMPACT SITE\nThe general location of the particle impact sites are known from care-\n\nful measurements performed during both the set up and performance of the\ntests. Impact sites on the glass surfaces are read\'ly visible with the\nunaided eye. However, with the HRSI and LPSI samples a metallograph was\nrequired to scan the suspected regions. Both the I T " and the LRSI samples\nexhibited spall formation from the particle impacts, which greatly aided\nidentification of the impact site. Figures 4, 5 and 6 indicate the approximate locations of the particle impacts for each of the test conditions with\nthe three Orbiter surfaces.\n4.2 CRATER PHOTOGRAPHS\nFigures 7 through 14 were taken with a metallograph to illustrate\ncrater and spall formation resulting from the impacting particles. Photographs of the glass surface at a magnification of 50X (see Figures 7A, 8A\nand 9A) illustrate the extent and particle distribution of the particle\n9\t\n\nOKI(ANAI, PAGE V3\nOF 1`OO1t QUA13TY\n\nn\n\n\t\n\nC)\nc.^\n\ni\n\nO\ni\n\nv\n\n0.\n\n10\n\nC\n\nS^\nR\n\nW\nJ\na\n\nLl-\n\no,\n\nL\n\nQl\n\n3\n\nc\n\n0\n\nv\n\ns\n\nC7\n\nCA\nLn\nro\n\nV)\n\nE\nro\n\nQ.\n\nQ1\n\nN\n\nE\n\nU\nro\nCL\n\n4--)\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2r\nC/1\n\nO\nJ\nGJ\n\nU\n\nro\n\nc\nO\n\nN\n\nTRW No. 32910-6001-RU-00\n\nZ\n\nI v+\nZ ~\nQ ^1\n\n3\n\nJ\nW\nJ 1\n\nW\n\nV)\n\nZ\nZ\n\nV1\n\nLA\n\nO\nZ\nW\n\nJ\n\nJ\nQ\n\nA\n\np\t\nN ^O\n\n_V\t\n\nW\t\n\nV\nl)\n\nN\n\nZ\n\nC^\nY\n\nV\nQ\nm\n\nO\nLL\n\n_-\t\n\nt\n\nN\n\nr\n\ni\n\n2\nLA\nZ\n\nO\nN\nZ\nw\n\nJ\nJ\nQ\n\n^\n\n^\n\nTRW No. 32970-6001-RU-00\n\nc\n0\n^o\n\nu\nN\n\nO\nJ\n\n4--3\n\nV)\nu\nev\nR\n\nE\n\nv\nn\nE\nV)\n\ni\nrn\nLA-\n\nTRW No. 32970-6001-RU-00\n\nL 808010\n500016\n\nCERAMIC )\n\n3 4\n\n2\n\n1\t\n\n2.5\n\n^2 . 0 I\n- T 1.5 1\n2\n3\n\n2\n1\n\nALL DIMENSIONS IN RICHES\nFigure 6.

Also, Figures 17B and 18B indicate that very slow\nparticles were leaking through the particle deflection system. Obviously\nthese particles do not possess a sufficient charge-to-mass ratio to be\ndeflected off the beam axis. It is believed that these particles have\nlost some of their charge, possibly through collisions with the internal\nstructure of the particle detectors.\n\n5. SUMMARY\n\nParticle impact tests were perfom,ed on three types of Orbiter surface\nwith the TRW Micrometeoroid Facility. The tests \xc2\xb0imulated the impact of\nAl 2 0 3 particles contained in the rocket exhaust of the Interim Upper Stage\nand the Solid Spinning Upper Stage. Test particles were titanium diboride\nwith typical particle velocities in the range 1-2.3 km \xe2\x80\xa2 sec -1 and equivalent\nparticle diameters in the range 4-16 microns. \t\n\nImpact angles to the material\n\nsurface were 90", 60 0 and 30". The particle impact sites were located on\nthe sample surfaces and craters were photographed with a magnification of\n400X. Test surfaces will then be sent to NASA Johnson Space Center for\nfurther analysis.\n\n25\n\nTRW No. 32970-6001-RU-00\n\nREFERENCES\n\n1.\n\nFriichtenicht, J.
