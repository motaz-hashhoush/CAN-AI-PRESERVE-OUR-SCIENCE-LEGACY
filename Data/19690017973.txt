b O 0 C ,\n\nSome con-\n\nalthough it i s f a r l e s s\n\ncomplete than f o r @olymers derived from tetramines.\n\nOther unidentified\n\ns t r u c t u r e s a r e a l s o produced.\nWhen preparing prepolymer from a dianhydride and a tetramine, it\nwas found t h a t addition of triethylamine o r other bases reduced t h e\ngelation tendency and permitted an increase of polymer concentration\n\nfrom 10 t o 16%.\n\nAcids accelerated gelation.\n\nPoor laminates were obtained\n\nfrom these solutions.\nSolutions of l o w molecular weight polymers up t o 30% s o l i d s were\nobtained by t h e reaction of tetramines w i t h d i e s t e r diacids.\nlaminates were obtained.\n\nFairly good\n\nCure of these polymers apparently goes through\n\na stage containing both imide and amide e s t e r linkages, which i s very\npoorly converted t o pyrrone.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nSeveral investigators have reported the synthesis of pyrrone\npolymers by various procedures.\n\n1-6 A number of problems were\n\nencountered, and none of t h e methods has been e n t i r e l y satisfactory.\nThe method we have chosen t o investigate i s t h a t of polymerization i n\na p r o t i c polar solvents. 1\n\n9 5\n\nW have a l s o done some work w i t h e s t e r and\ne\n\ne s t e r - s a l t syntheses. 496\nI n t h e usual synthesis of pyrrones i n aprotie solvents, a\ndianhydride i s added graduallyto a s t i r r e d solution of t h e equivalent\nquantity of an aromatic o,o-tetramine.\n\nA soluble poly (amino acid\n\namide) i s produced, which i s converted t o t h e pyrrone by heating.\nIdeally, t h e polymerization and cure reactions proceed as follows:\n\n3\n\n2\n\nEq. 1 shows t h e formation of t h e soluble poly (amino acid amide) a t\nmoderate temperatures.\n\nEq. 2 and 3 show two routes by which t h e\n\nsoluble intermediate can be converted by heat t o the pyrrone structure.\nApparently t h e a c t u a l reactions are more complex than t h i s .\n\nOne\n\ncomplication i s t h e p o s s i b i l i t y of crosslinking i n t h e soluble polymer:\n\nAlthough t h e amine groups of t h e poly (amino acid amide) a r e somewhat\ndeactivated by the presence of an ortho acylamido group, they a r e s t i l l\nmoderately reactive toward anhydrides,\n\nWhen reaction 1 nears completion,\n\nt h e concentration of t h e ortho diamino structure, which now occurs\nl a r g e l y on chain ends, becomes very small r e l a t i v e t o t h a t of the ortho\naminoamide structure.\n\nThe l a t t e r then begins t o compete successfully\n\nf o r anhydride groups, crosslinking occurs, and t h e polymer becomes\ninsoluble.\n\nThe presence of a s l i g h t excess of anhydride during t h e\n\nsynthesis has been found t o produce gelation by t h i s mechanism. 5\nCrosslinking may a l s o occur during cure by a d i f f e r e n t mechanism i f\nexcess amino groups a r e present:\n\n3\n\nI n addition t o t h e problem of gelation, these crosslinking reactions\nintroduce imide and benzimidazole linkages i n t o t h e f i n a l polymer\nstructure.\nThe soluble polymer i s believed t o be considerably more complex\n.\nthan t h e simple amino amide acid shown i n eq. 1 Strong association\nwith t h e solvent occurs, and cyclic and ionic forms, such a s t h e\nfollowing, probably occur i n equilibrium:\n\n0-\n\nExperience with t h e closely r e l a t e d polyamide acids (polyimide precursors) 7- 9\nindicates t h a t the various s t r u c t u r a l forms of t h e amino acid amide group\nr e a c t readily with anhydride o r amino groups i n an exchange reaction. 9\nPolymer chains i n solution, then, are continually breaking and reforming\ni n a l a b i l e equilibrium, which probably includes a small concentration of\ncrosslinked structures, such a s t h e product of eq.\n\ni s not present i n excess.\n\n4, even\n\nwhen anhydride\n\nAs t h e concentration is increased, bimolecular\n\nreactions a r e favored, t h e equilibrium s h i f t s toward crosslinked structures,\n\n4\n\nand gelation occurs.\n\nIntermolecular association of t h e ionized forms\n\na l s o increases with concentration, giving apparent crosslinking.\nAnother consequence of the ionic structures i s an abnormally high\nv i s c o s i t y due t o polyelectrolyte e f f e c t s .\nAs a r e s u l t of these various reactions\n\ni n solution it has been\n\nfound quite d i f f i c u l t t o obtain a soluble poly (amino acid amide) of\nhigh molecular weight by t h i s method.\n\nGelation occurs unless a d i l u t e\n\nsolution i s used, with very rapid s t i r r i n g and slow addition of a\nsolution of dianhydride. 3\xe2\x80\x995\n\nWhen these conditions are used, the\n\nsolution v i s c o s i t y increases s t e a d i l y as dianhydride is added, w i t h\nno sharp r i s e a t equivalence,\nproduces sudden gelation.\n\n4\n\nalthough a s l i g h t excess of dianhydride\n\nI n contrast, the preparation of polyamide\n\nacids (polyimide precursors) by a similar procedure from diamines and\ndianhydrides occurs with a s t e e p v i s c o s i t y r i s e at equivalence and no\ngelation problems. 799\nThe gelation and high v i s c o s i t y r e s u l t i n g from crosslinked and\nionized s t r u c t u r e s can be reduced o r eliminated by blocking one of t h e\namine groups i n each o f t h e ortho pairs.\n\nSince we a r e now dealing w i t h\n\nt h e reaction of a diamine and a dianhydride, behavior t y p i c a l of normal\npolyamide acids can be expected.\n\nFor example, if one of t h e groups i s\n\nacetylated t h e following reaction sequence i s expected:\n\n5\n\nThe acetamido group w i l l not r e a c t with anhydrides a t room temperature t o\ngive crosslinking a s i n eq.\n\n4, nor is it\n\nbasic enough t o a b s t r a c t a proton\n\nfrom a carboxyl group t o give a polyelectrolyte.\n\nTherefore t h e polymeriza-\n\nt i o n reaction (eq. 6 ) i s expected t o proceed without gelation, a t concentrat i o n s higher than can be used i n the usual reaction (eq. 1). Other blocking\ngroups, such as t r l m e t h y l s i l y l , can be expected t o work i n a similar way.\nProblems t h a t might be encountered with t h e blocked systems a r e reduced\nr e a c t i v i t y of the remaining amino groups and d i f f i c u l t y i n eliminating\nt h e blocking groups i n t h e f i n a l step.\n\nThe use of protected amino groups avoids gelation by assuring t h a t\nt h e soluble polymer i s not crosslinked, although it i s of high molecular\nweight.\n\nA second way t o prevent gelation is t o e s t e r i f y the dianhydride\n\ncomponent.\n\nThis\n\nmethod gives a soluble intermediate of low molecular\n\nweight, which polymerizes f u r t h e r on curing,\n\n4\n\nA t h i r d approach i s t o\n\nmodify t h e solvent system t o minimize polymer-solvent interactions and\nionization.\n\nMost of t h e work reported here i s r e l a t e d t o t h e f i r s t\n\nmethod, with l e s s e r amounts on the second and t h i r d .\n\n6\n\nSYMBOLS\nA considerable number of complex organic compounds have been used\n\nin this study.
