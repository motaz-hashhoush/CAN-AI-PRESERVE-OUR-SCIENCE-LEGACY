Such models have become increasingly sophisticated as improvements in opacities, in the equation of state, and in the treatment of convection were incorporated during the last 15 to 20 years. As a result, spectrophotometric data on M dwarfs can now be fitted rather well by current models. The various attempts at modeling M dwarf photospheres in purely thermal terms are summarized. Some extensions of these models to include the effects of microturbulence and magnetic inhomogeneities are presented.", "title": "M dwarfs: Theoretical work", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-05T18:17:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19880002220, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Mullan, Dermott J."}, "organization": {"name": "Delaware Univ.", "location": "Newark, DE, United States"}}, "id": "c877975070cd4a60b63def0af36b76ba"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19880002220, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19880002220, "id": "940e64fd1b434bfe87a768b5b77a2d9b", "publicationName": "NASA, Washington, The M-Type Stars", "publicationDate": "1987-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19880002220.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19880002220/downloads/19880002220.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19880002220/downloads/19880002220.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19880002220/downloads/19880002220.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
