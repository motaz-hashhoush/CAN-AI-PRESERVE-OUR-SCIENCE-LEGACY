b'SUMMARY REPORT OF COMMITTEE B\nPrepared from Session Notes Furnished by:\nDonald H. Lenschow\nNational Center for Atmospheric Research\nCommittee Composition: (See Table 4 , page 11 )\nI. General Aviation and Services\nCan military weather information be made available\nto General Aviation? Since the military role is\ndifferent from General Aviation, there are limits\nto the use of its weather information because of\noperation schedules and budget limitations. For\nexample, military weather recordings are not always\navailable on weekends.\nWeather information provided by Flight Service\nStations (FSS) is often not uniform and is too\npessimistic. Although winds aloft data are\navailable every 12 hours, there is a problem in\ntimely distribution. There appear to be many complaints about the availability of weather information on the West Coast of the United States. The\ncause is attributed to lack of communication,\nupstream reporting stations, and knowledge of the\navailability of local information. More information is needed on the availability of cloud top\nheights. Some concern was expressed about whether\nor not the future AFOS program (Automation of\nField Operations and Services within the National\nWeather Service) will have the right kind of data\nneeded by General Aviation.\nPrivate pilots need to be more knowledgeable\nabout weather. Student pilots should have some\nexposure to flying in clouds before being licensed.\n\n314\n\nImprovement is needed in providing General\nAviation pilots with changes in the weather\nreporting and forecasting system.\nFAA should develop more "single concept" type\ntraining films on weather.\n11.\n\nAircraft Design\nThere appear to be no standards or specifications\nfor reducing lightning damage. Static discharge\nsystem reduces radio noise but not lightning\nstrikes. Not enough information is available to\ndo adequate design. Solid state systems on widebodied aircraft are particularly szbject to\nproblems from lightning strikes. Composites and\nfiberglas give problems because of poor electromagnetic shielding--not unsolvable! Additional\nmeasurements on aircraft are needed, including\ncharacteristics of lightning. It is believed that\nsystems can be protected with reasonable expense\nif considered at the beginning level. Fuel\nsystems nay still be a problem. FAA examiners\nshould consider the lightning danger when certifying fuel tanks s o explosions can be avoided.\nLighting can also cause compressive stalls on some\naircraft. There is a problem in these areas in\ntransferring technology from research to General\nAviation manufacturers.\n\nSimulation\nConcern was expressed for determining the limits and\nprocedures for landing aircraft in wind shear.\nWhat is the maximum value of wind shear?\nWhat is the limiting value beyond which a landing\nshould not be attempted?\n1x1.\n\n0\n\n3 15\n\nUnder what conditions does one take out autoland?\nWould more wind information from the aircraft to\nthe ground station contribute to improved shear\nadvisories?\nThere should be some simulation of various severe shear\nprofiles in training simulators, although there is still a\nproblem in simulating shear conditions using mathematical\nmodels and data.\n0\n\n3 16\n\nSUMMARY REPORT OF COMMITTEE C\nW i l l i a m Horn, Jr.\nNational Business A i r c r a f t A s s o c i a t i o n , Inc.\nWashington , D .
