With the emergence of cloud computing, this has quickly become a viable approach for enabling \u201cscience at scale\u201d. Researchers are no longer hindered by obstacles of data management and data wrangling, allowing them to quickly discover, access and perform analysis on extremely large datasets. Infrastructures that move data out of institutional silos and into a computational platform, will ensure that data and tools are accessible to all users. NASA\u2019s Interagency Implementation and Advanced Concepts Team (IMPACT) seeks to address these rapid technology developments by establishing Space Act Agreements with selected partners from the public-private sector working in the area of cloud computing. These agreements aim to explore new opportunities with commercial cloud providers to accelerate open science and enable discovery, access and use of data sets on the cloud. In addition, they will also help establish training workshops for the science community to help researchers utilize the cloud for science. In this talk, we will present an overview of current and new partnerships we are developing to support open science and open data initiatives.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "cui": {"isCui": false}, "meetings": [{"country": "US", "submissionId": 20210025432, "endDate": "2021-12-17T06:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"organizationId": "2c68d5a64328524bad2bff8993b4dc5f", "meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Geophysical Union", "location": "Washington D.C., District of Columbia, United States"}}, "meetingId": "fa07395f79d5413d84ae0ad1a4ad17b8", "id": "c18423b6c73b457e860bbc38b9fd03eb"}], "name": "AGU Fall Meeting 2021", "location": "New Orleans, LA", "id": "fa07395f79d5413d84ae0ad1a4ad17b8", "url": "https://www.agu.org/Fall-Meeting", "startDate": "2021-12-13T06:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "AGU - Partnership elightening 2021.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20210025432/downloads/AGU%20-%20Partnership%20elightening%202021.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20210025432/downloads/AGU%20-%20Partnership%20elightening%202021.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20210025432/downloads/AGU%20-%20Partnership%20elightening%202021.pdf.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
