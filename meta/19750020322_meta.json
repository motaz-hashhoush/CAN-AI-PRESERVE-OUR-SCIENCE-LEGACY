Real or simulated Doppler spectra versus range and elevation is used and the spatial distributions of various spectral moments or other spectral characteristics are calculated and displayed. Each of the real or simulated scans can be processed by one of three different procedures: simple frequency or wavenumber filtering, matched filtering, and deconvolution filtering. The final output is displayed as contour plots in an x-y coordinate system, as well as in the form of vortex tracks deduced from the maxima of the processed data. A detailed analysis of run number 1023 and run number 2023 is presented to demonstrate the data analysis procedure. Vortex tracks and system range resolutions are compared with theoretical predictions.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19750020322, "id": "06f2606e29754b88bcd88cab2927545e", "publicationDate": "1975-02-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19750020322.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19750020322/downloads/19750020322.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19750020322/downloads/19750020322.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19750020322/downloads/19750020322.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
