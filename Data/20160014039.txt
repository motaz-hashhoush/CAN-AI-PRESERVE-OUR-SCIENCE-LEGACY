b'Automated ISS Flight Utilities\nJan Tuzli\xc4\x87 Offermann\nNASA Johnson Space Center\n\nDuring my internship at NASA Johnson Space Center, I worked in the Space\nRadiation Analysis Group (SRAG), where I was tasked with a number of projects\nfocused on the automation of tasks and activities related to the operation of the\nInternational Space Station (ISS). As I worked on a number of projects, I have written\nshort sections below to give a description for each, followed by more general remarks\non the internship experience.\nMy \xef\xac\x81rst project is titled \xe2\x80\x9cGeneral Exposure Representation EVADOSE\xe2\x80\x9d, also\nknown as \xe2\x80\x9cGEnEVADOSE\xe2\x80\x9d. This project involved the design and development of a C++/\nROOT framework focused on radiation exposure for extravehicular activity (EVA)\nplanning for the ISS. The utility helps mission managers plan EVAs by displaying\ninformation on the cumulative radiation doses that crew will receive during an EVA as a\nfunction of the egress time and duration of the activity. SRAG uses a utility called\nEVADOSE, employing a model of the space radiation environment in low Earth orbit to\npredict these doses, as while outside the ISS the astronauts will have less shielding\nfrom charged particles such as electrons and protons. However, EVADOSE output is\ncumbersome to work with, and prior to GEnEVADOSE, querying data and producing\ngraphs of ISS trajectories and cumulative doses versus egress time required manual\nwork in Microsoft Excel. GEnEVADOSE automates all this work, reading in EVADOSE\noutput \xef\xac\x81le(s) along with a plaintext \xef\xac\x81le input by the user providing input parameters.\nGEnEVADOSE will output a text \xef\xac\x81le containing all the necessary dosimetry for each\nproposed EVA egress time, for each speci\xef\xac\x81ed EVADOSE \xef\xac\x81le. It also plots cumulative\ndose versus egress time and the ISS trajectory, and displays all of this information in an\nauto-generated presentation made in LaTeX. New features have also been added, such\nas best-case scenarios (egress times corresponding to the least dose), interpolated\ncurves for trajectories, and the ability to query any time in the EVADES output. As\nmentioned above, GEnEVADOSE makes extensive use of ROOT version 6, the data\nanalysis framework developed at the European Organization for Nuclear Research\n(CERN), and the code is written to the C++11 standard (as are the other projects).\nMy second project is the Automated Mission Reference Exposure Utility\n(AMREU). Unlike GEnEVADOSE, AMREU is a combination of three frameworks written\nin both Python and C++, also making use of ROOT (and PyROOT). Run as a\n\ncombination of daily and weekly cron jobs, these macros query the SRAG database\nsystem to determine the active ISS missions, and query minute-by-minute radiation\ndose information from ISS-TEPC (Tissue Equivalent Proportional Counter), one of the\nradiation detectors onboard the ISS. Using this information, AMREU creates a corrected\ndata set of daily radiation doses, addressing situations where TEPC may be of\xef\xac\x82ine or\nlocked up by correcting doses for days with less than 95% live time (the total amount\ntime the instrument acquires data) by averaging the past 7 days. As not all errors may\nbe automatically detectable, AMREU also allows for manual corrections, checking an\nupdated plaintext \xef\xac\x81le each time it runs. With the corrected data, AMREU generates\ncumulative dose plots for each mission, and uses a Python script to generate a \xef\xac\x82ight\nnote \xef\xac\x81le (.docx format) containing these plots, as well as information sections to be \xef\xac\x81lled\nin and modi\xef\xac\x81ed by the space weather environment of\xef\xac\x81cers with information speci\xef\xac\x81c to\nthe week. AMREU is set up to run without requiring any user input, and it automatically\narchives old \xef\xac\x82ight notes and information \xef\xac\x81les for missions that are no longer active.\nMy other projects involve cleaning up a large data set from the Charged Particle\nDirectional Spectrometer (CPDS), joining together many different data sets in order to\nclean up information in SRAG SQL databases, and developing other automated utilities\nfor displaying information on active solar regions, that may be used by the space\nweather environment of\xef\xac\x81cers to monitor solar activity.\nI consulted my mentor Dr. Ryan Rios and Dr. Kerry Lee for project requirements\nand added features, and ROOT developer Edmond Offermann for advice on using the\nROOT library. I also received advice and feedback from Dr. Janet Barzilla of SRAG, who\ntested my code. Besides these inputs, I worked independently, writing all of the code by\nmyself. The code for all these projects is documented throughout, and I have attempted\nto write it in a modular format. Assuming that ROOT is updated accordingly, these codes\nare also Y2038-compliant (and Y10K-compliant). This allows the code to be easily\nreferenced, modi\xef\xac\x81ed and possibly repurposed for non-ISS missions in the future, should\nthe necessary inputs exist.\nThese projects have taught me a lot about coding and software design \xe2\x80\x93 I have\nbecome a much more skilled C++ programmer and ROOT user, and I also learned to\ncode in Python and PyROOT (and its advantages and disadvantages compared to C++/\n\nROOT). Furthermore, I have learned about space radiation and radiation modeling,\ntopics that greatly interest me as I pursue a degree in physics. Working alongside\nexperimental physicists like Dr. Rios, I have developed a greater understanding and\nappreciation for experimental science, something I have always leaned towards but to\nwhich I lacked signi\xef\xac\x81cant exposure. My work in SRAG has also given me the invaluable\nopportunity to witness the work environment for physicists at NASA, and what a career\nin academia may look like at a government laboratory such as NASA Johnson Space\nCenter. As I continue my studies and look forward to graduate school and a future\ncareer, this experience at NASA has given me a meaningful and enjoyable opportunity\nto put my skills to use and see what my future career path might hold.\n\nFigure 1.
