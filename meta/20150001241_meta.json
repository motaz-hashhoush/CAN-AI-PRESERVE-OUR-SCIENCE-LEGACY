This alternative mission approach, designated the Robotic Boulder Capture Option (Option B), has been investigated to determine the mission feasibility and identify potential differences from the initial ARRM concept of capturing an entire small NEA (4-10 meters in size), which has been designated the Small Asteroid Capture Option (Option A). Compared to the initial ARRM concept, Option B allows for centimeter-level characterization over an entire large NEA, the certainty of target NEA composition type, the ability to select the boulder that is captured, numerous opportunities for mission enhancements to support science objectives, additional experience operating at a low-gravity planetary body including extended surface contact, and the ability to demonstrate future planetary defense strategies on a hazardous-size NEA. Option B can leverage precursor missions and existing Agency capabilities to help ensure mission success by targeting wellcharacterized asteroids and can accommodate uncertain programmatic schedules by tailoring the return mass.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20150001241, "endDate": "2014-08-07T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Inst. of Aeronautics and Astronautics", "location": "Reston, VA, United States"}}, "meetingId": "50c100961e1643238fef8b0d74fe6ddf", "id": "aafc1cbf0cae4b19bd46d954d3b28816"}], "name": "SPACE 2014", "location": "San Diego, CA", "id": "50c100961e1643238fef8b0d74fe6ddf", "startDate": "2014-08-04T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20150001241, "id": "7c0a0afd7fc1444ca53eda1bafb461f6", "publicationDate": "2014-08-04T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20150001241.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20150001241/downloads/20150001241.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20150001241/downloads/20150001241.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20150001241/downloads/20150001241.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
