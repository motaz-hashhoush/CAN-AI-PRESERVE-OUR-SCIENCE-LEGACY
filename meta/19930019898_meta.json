It includes an input end connected to a microwave receiver antenna and an output end which produces a digital count proportional to the amplitude of a signal of a selected microwave frequency band received at the antenna and corresponding to one of the water vapor absorption lines near frequencies of 20 GHz or 30 GHz. The hybrid package is on the order of several centimeters in length and a few centimeters in height and width. The package includes an L-shaped carrier having a base surface, a vertical wall extending up from the base surface and forming a corner therewith, and connection pins extending through the vertical wall. Modular blocks rest on the base surface against the vertical wall and support microwave monolithic integrated circuits on top surfaces thereof connected to the external connection pins. The modular blocks lie end-to-end on the base surface so as to be modularly removable by sliding along the base surface beneath the external connection pins away from the vertical wall.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19930019898, "id": "518443342e904af69f541ba9c8253880", "publicationDate": "1993-06-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"type": "SUPERSEDED_BY", "accessionNumber": "N92-30103"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19930019898.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19930019898/downloads/19930019898.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19930019898/downloads/19930019898.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19930019898/downloads/19930019898.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
