Robert M.\nHaberle, Space Science and Astrobiology Division, NASA/Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, CA 94035, Robert.M.Haberle@nasa.gov.\n\nIntroduction: Today Mars is a cold, dry, desert\nplanet. Liquid water is not stable on its surface. There\nare no lakes, seas, or oceans, and rain falls nowhere at\nno time during the year. Yet early in its history during\nthe Noachian epoch, there is geological and mineralogical evidence that liquid water did indeed flow on\nits surface creating drainage systems, lakes, and \xe2\x80\x93 possibly - seas and oceans [1]. The implication is that\nearly Mars had a different climate than it does today,\none that was based on a thicker atmosphere with a\nmore powerful greenhouse effect that was capable of\nproducing an active hydrological cycle with rainfall,\nrunoff, and evaporation. Since Mariner 9 began accumulating such evidence, researchers have been trying\nto understand what kind of a climate system could\nhave created greenhouse conditions favorable for liquid water. Unfortunately, the problem is not yet solved.\nFaint Young Sun: The principle issue is coping\nwith the faint young sun. Stellar evolution models and\nobservations suggest that stars like our Sun increase in\nluminosity with time [2]. During the Noachian epoch\nthe sun was approximately 25% less luminous than it is\ntoday. All things being equal, this means that the\nplanet\xe2\x80\x99s effective temperature would have been 196 K,\nabout 15 Kelvins less than it is today. Thus, if a\nstronger greenhouse effect from a different early atmosphere is the solution, as is thought to be the case\nfor Earth, then for Mars it must produce 77 K of warming to bring mean annual surface temperatures up to\nthe melting point of water. Furthermore, any greenhouse theory must (a) produce the warming and rainfall needed, (b) have a plausible source for the gases\nrequired, (c) be sustainable, and (d) explain how the\natmosphere evolved to its present state. These are challenging requirements and judging from the literature\nthey have yet to be met.\n\nFig 1. Timeline of early Mars.\nOrigin and Evolution of the Atmosphere: To\nassess the feasibility of an early greenhouse atmosphere on Mars we need to consider its organ and evo-\n\nlution. Fig. 1 summarizes our present thinking. Mars\nformed quickly with accretion and core formation\nlargely complete within the first 10 Ma. Impact devolatization created a steam atmosphere and possibly a\nmagma ocean. Much of this water was probably lost\nduring a brief episode of hydrodynamic escape. A secondary atmosphere subsequently developed from volcanic outgassing. Since rapid core formation probably\nleft the mantle in a mildly oxidizing state, the composition of this secondary atmosphere was likely dominated by CO2 and H2O. Estimates of their initial abundances range from 6-15 bars of CO2 and 10\xe2\x80\x99s to 1000\xe2\x80\x99s\nof meters of water, though their outgassing history and\nsubsequent fate is of course highly uncertain. Although\nwater can escape, enough must have been present during the Noachian to form the observed fluvial features.\nAnd while there are a variety of loss mechanisms that\ncan limit the buildup of CO2, outgassing associated\nwith Tharsis volcanism likely produced a Noachian\natmosphere that was thicker than it is at the present\ntime. How much thicker is difficult to determine, but\nfactors of 10-100 times thicker do not seem unreasonable. On the other hand, atmospheres too much thicker\nthan this are not consistent with outgassing models [3],\nimpact/sputtering removal estimates [4], loss to the\ncarbonate reservoir [5], and small-crater statistics [6].\nThus, the Noachian atmosphere was likely predominantly CO2 with a rough upper limit of ~ 1 bar.\nGreenhouse Models: An early CO2/H2O atmosphere would have produced a greenhouse effect whose\nmagnitude depends on their abundances. The first studies of such atmospheres showed that 5-10 bars of CO2,\nless than the estimated inventory, could have raised\nsurface temperatures to the melting point. However,\nmore detailed follow on work showed that Rayleigh\nscattering [7], CO2 condensation [8], and more realistic\ntreatment of collision-induced absorptions [9], limited\nthe ability of these atmospheres to produce warm and\nwet conditions regardless of how much CO2 was available. And though reflecting CO2 clouds once showed\nsome promise, their contribution was ultimately shown\nto be inadequate as well [7]. Thus, state-of-the-art\nmodels of pure CO2/H2O atmospheres do not appear\ncapable of raising mean annual surface temperatures\nmuch above ~235 K during the Noachian epoch for\nsurface pressures near the upper limit of ~1 bar.\nCould additional greenhouse gases solve the problem? As mentioned above, it is likely that the early\natmosphere was composed mainly of CO2 and water.\nBut there are a variety of gases that even in trace\namounts in such an atmosphere could help reduce the\n\noutgoing long wave radiation needed to boost the\ngreenhouse effect. Sulfur dioxide (SO2), methane\n(CH4), hydrogen sulfide (H2S), ammonia (NH3), and\nnitrous oxide (N2O), have all been considered in the\nliterature, but only for SO2 has there been significant\npublished work on this topic [10]. Fig 2. shows the\nwavelength dependence of the absorption crosssections for these gases to illustrate which regions in\nthe infrared they are most effective. More recently,\nhydrogen (H2) has been suggested as a possible trace\ngas that could solve the early Mars dilemma [11].\nWhile under the right circumstances these gases can\nproduce warm and wet conditions, their sources and\nsinks cast doubt on their ability to achieve and maintain the needed concentrations. Thus, while supplemental greenhouse gases offer an attractive solution to\nthe faint young sun problem, they have sustainability\nissues that have yet to be resolved.\n\nFig. 2. Absorptions cross-sections of potential\ngreenhouse gases.\nContinuous vs. Episodic: A major question in the\ndebate about early Mars revolves around the needed\nduration of warm and wet conditions. Do the observed\nfluvial features require a long-lived (106-108 years??)\ncontinuously warm and wet climate system with an\nactive hydrological cycle, or could these features be\nproduced in transient warm and wet episodes due to\nimpacts and/or volcanism for example? If long-lived\ncontinuous conditions are required then large bodies of\nliquid water, i.e., seas or oceans (as opposed to lakes or\nponds) must have existed on the surface. Given the\ntheoretical difficulty of sustaining such conditions,\nsome researchers have explored the episodic alternative [12]. Certainly volcanic activity and impact rates\nwere much higher during the Noachian and both are\ncapable of temporarily changing the climate. However,\nthe main problem with these ideas is demonstrating\n\nthat they can produce enough rainfall and erosion to\nexplain the fluvial features. And for the impact hypothesis there is the additional constraint of not overwhelming the system with deluge style flooding since\nbreached craters, which such flooding would produce,\nare rare [13].\nCold Early Mars: Yet another alternative is that\nearly Mars was mostly cold and occasionally wet. In\nthis instance the fluvial features would form from the\noccasional melting of surface ice deposits. General\ncirculation model simulations of CO2/H2O atmospheres with surface pressure above ~ 200 mb show that\nsuch atmospheres can deliver considerable snowfall to\nthe southern highlands [14]. As long as temperatures\nthere can later reach the melting point, liquid water\nwill flow and erode the surface. Under the right circumstances, glacial melting of southern ice sheets\ncould also form a cold northern ocean that would suppress clay formation thereby explaining the paucity of\nclays in exposed northern plains [15]. However, these\nscenarios still require an energy source to melt the ice.\nTowards a Solution: The problem of early Mars\nremains unsolved. Progress will come from a multidisciplinary research effort. The geological community\nshould strive to reach a consensus on the need for rainfall (vs. snowmelt or hydrothermal melting, for example). If rainfall is required, what are its intensity, timing, and duration? Better estimates of the erodibility of\nthe surface and the volume of eroded material would\nalso be helpful. From the geochemical community, a\nbetter understanding of the redox state of the mantle\nand the volume and timing of outgassed volatiles during the first billion years would provide important constraints on the mass and composition of the atmosphere\nand how it evolved. And from the climate community,\nthe trend toward the use of sophisticated general circulation models should continue. These models can address several areas that have not yet received enough\nattention including, orbital variations, the greenhouse\npotential of water ice clouds, and impact-induced climate change.\nReferences: [1] Carr, M.H.
