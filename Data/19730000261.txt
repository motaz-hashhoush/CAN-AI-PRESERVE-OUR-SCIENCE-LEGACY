The degree of hazard\npresent with bioelectronic instruments can be reduced\nby proper, careful use, but the possibility of human\nerror still exists.\nAs part of the Skylab program, an electroshock\nprotection circuit was developed to prevent accidental\nshock through the electrodes to the test subjects. This\ncircuit is placed between the electrical apparatus and\nthe electrode that is attached to the patient's body.\nThe circuit, which is shown in the diagram, allows\nundistorted signal voltage transfer, as long as the current\nremains low. If a high current tries to flow from terminal\nA toward terminal B, it will produce a potential\ndifference across resistor R2 to the extent that the left\nside of R2 is at a higher potential than the right side.\nThis potential biases the gate electrodes of the fieldeffect transistors, Q3 and Q4, to produce an extremely\nhigh impedance. Similarly, a current flow in the opposite\ndirection is cut off by a bias on the gates of Q 1 and Q2.\nThis circuit effectively protects the patient from\ndangerous electrical shock that might be caused by a\n\nfailure in the electrical apparatus. When a 1,000-Hz\nsignal at 141 Vac (rms) is applied to the terminals of\nthe network, the current is limited to approximately\n87 MA.\nNotes:\n1. This electroshock protection circuit may also be used\nto protect sensitive electrical measuring circuits.\n2.
