The examination identifies some unresolved theoretical considerations and permits a preliminary formulation of an energy storage theory. A number of candidates in the low and high temperature ranges are presented along with a rating of candidates or potential candidates. A few interesting candidates in the 0 to 100 C region are also included. It is concluded that storage by means of reactions whose reversibility can be controlled either by product removal or by catalytic means appear to offer appreciable advantages over storage with reactions whose reversability cannot be controlled. Among such advantages are listed higher heat storage capacities and more favorable options regarding temperatures of collection, storage, and delivery. Among the disadvantages are lower storage efficiencies.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19760006504, "id": "6be15fa6a5674ab4b431484a58ddeb6c", "publicationDate": "1975-11-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19760006504.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19760006504/downloads/19760006504.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19760006504/downloads/19760006504.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19760006504/downloads/19760006504.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
