Abundant renewable energy at lunar or L1 locations could support propellant production and storage in refueling scenarios that enable affordable exploration. Renewable energy platforms in geosynchronous Earth orbits can collect and transmit power to satellites, or to Earth-surface locations. Energy-rich space technologies also enable the use of electric-powered propulsion systems that could efficiently deliver cargo and exploration facilities to remote locations. A first step to an energy-rich space infrastructure is a 100-kWe class solar-powered platform in Earth orbit. The platform would utilize advanced technologies in solar power collection and generation, power management and distribution, thermal management, and electric propulsion. It would also provide a power-rich free-flying platform to demonstrate in space a portfolio of technology flight experiments. This paper presents a preliminary design concept for a 100-kWe solar-powered satellite with the capability to flight-demonstrate a variety of payload experiments and to utilize electric propulsion. State-of-the-art solar concentrators, highly efficient multi-junction solar cells, integrated thermal management on the arrays, and innovative deployable structure design and packaging make the 100-kW satellite feasible for launch on one existing launch vehicle. Higher voltage arrays and power management and distribution (PMAD) systems reduce or eliminate the need for massive power converters, and could enable direct- drive of high-voltage solar electric thrusters.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "Japan", "submissionId": 20050245135, "endDate": "2005-10-21T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "56th International Astronautical Congress Meeting: Strategies to Establish a \"Stepping Stone\" Approach to our Future in Space", "location": "Fukoaka", "id": "479c96b440e441f0b199658c2ea6371f", "startDate": "2005-10-17T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20050245135, "id": "ff6836a81d0949e89e51622b175a4936", "publicationDate": "2005-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20050245135.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20050245135/downloads/20050245135.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20050245135/downloads/20050245135.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20050245135/downloads/20050245135.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
