The purpose of the tests was to provide experimental verification of the design and to provide a complete functional performance check of the instrument from the excitation of the sensors to and including the data processor and equipment test set. Each of the channels of the EPS was exposed to a calibrated beam of energetic particles, and counts were accumulated for a predetermined period of time for each of several energies. The counts were related to the known flux of particles to give a monodirectional response function for each channel. The measured response function of the test unit was compared to the response function determined for the calibration sensors from the data taken from the calibration program.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19730011759, "id": "3786ade6107a4c41bad002d026909b13", "publicationDate": "1972-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19730011759.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19730011759/downloads/19730011759.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19730011759/downloads/19730011759.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19730011759/downloads/19730011759.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
