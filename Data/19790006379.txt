A\ngoal of the program was that the six modules, fabricated with Mobil Tyco\'s EFG\nsilicon cells, should have an efficiency exceeding 8%. The module design is representative of a technology that can lead to an array cost of $0.50 per watt.\nThe modules were subjected to preliminary testing at Mobil Tyco and a local\ntest facility before shipment to JPL. The results of these tests indicated that\nthe average module efficiency was 8.7% and that the design was capable of surviving\nthe JPL acceptance tests. During the packing of the first three modules, it was\nnoted that some of the submodules had developed cracks at the terminal holes in the\nsubstrate. Mobil Tyco has redesigned the terminal attachment and has developed a\nnew method which eliminates the hole in the rear substrate by making the electrical\nconnection pass through the submodule seal. Two modules with the redesigned terminals and one module with the through-the-seal connection were shipped to JPL. The\nlast three modules show no signs of the cracking associated with the first three\nmodules.\n\n1\n\n2.0\t\n\nEFG SILICON RIBBON SOLAR CELLS\n\nThe edge defined film-fed growth (EFG) technology for the production of\nshaped crystals of silicon is the first: of the second generation sheet technologies\nto have reached a stage of maturity to permit the fabrication of significant quantities of high efficiency photovoltaic modules, The EFG process employs shaping capillary dies made of graphite to grow ribbon shaped crystals of silicon. Those crystals are nominally 2.5 cm in width x 0.025 cm in thickness and are grown in continuous lengths up to 30 meters, Current generation ribbon solar cells are nominally 2.5 cm x 10 cm in dimensions and energy conversion efficiencies in excess of\n10% (AM1) are routinely achieved using fairly standard solar cell processing techniques.\nThe principal advantages of the EFG technique include the ability to grow\ncrystals of predetermined shape, the achievement of high growth rates and the ability to grow multiple ribbon from a single growth machine.* SAMICS analysis of\nthe multiple ribbon growth technology has indicated that silicon sheet costs below\n$18/sq meter consistent with the $0.50/watt goal of the national photovoltaic program can be achieved.\nRibbon solar cells employed in the production of modules under this contract have been fabricated by conventional diffusion and metallization techniques.\nThe basic process consists of the following sequence:\n1.\n\nAcid clean as cut ribbon blanks (1" x 4" dimensions) using a low\nconcentration mixture of HF and HNO3.\n\n2.\n\nN+ diffusion using 1% PH3 in a carrier gas comp?bed of N2, 02\nand Ar to achieve a surface concentration of 10 atoms/sq. cm\nand a junction depth of 0.4 pm.\n\n3.\n\nRemove diffusion oxide in buffered HF.and evaporate aluminum on\nthe "back side" of the device.\n\n* On an experimental basis ribbons of width up to 7.5 cm have been grown and growth\nrates up to 7.5 cm/min. have been achieved. In addition five 5 cm wide ribbons\nhave been grown simultaneously from a single multiple ribbon machine.\n\n3\n\n6-.\n\n4.\n\nAlloy aluminum to counterdope back N+\n\n5.\n\nBuffered HF clean.\n\n6.\n\nContact evaporation using Cr-Ti-Ag with a total metal\nthickness of 1.5 pm.\n\n7.\n\nSinter contact metal.\n\n8.\n\nMask etch cell edges.\n\n9.\n\nSolder coat.\n\n10.\n\nDeposit Si 3 N4 antireflection coating.\n\n4\n\n3.0\t\n\nMODULE DESIGN\n\nThe Mobil Tyco photovoltaic module has been designed to survive extreme environmental conditions for 20 years yet incorporate features which can lead to a\nlow cost packaging system for silicon solar cells. Full consideration has been\ngiven to problems of differential thermal expansion, mechanical stress and package\ndegradation.\n\n3.1\t\n\nGeneral Module Description\n\nThe Mobil Tyco module consists of four separate submodules, each of\nwhich contains 45 EFG cells, which are series interconnected, to provide the nominal\noutput voltage. The four submodules are parallel interconnected to give higher current at the operating voltage. Figure 1 shows an overall layout of the module and submodules. Three strings of 15 cells are first formed; these strings are then interconnected, as shown in Fig. 2, to form the 45 cell submodule. Figure 3 shows a\ncross section of the module construction. The photographs in Figs. 4 and 5 are of\nmodules similar to those shipped to APL.\n\n3.2\t\n\nCell Interconnection\n\nThe EFG ribbon cells are interconnected with Exmet 3Cu6-3i0, expanded\ncopper mesh. The mesh extends across the length of the cell thereby providing redundant electrical connection along the cell bus bar. The expanded mesh provides\nflexibility for the differential thermal expansion between both the silicon and\ncopper, and between the silicon and glass cover and substrate. The copper mesh is\nsolder plated to allow reflow soldering to solder coated solar cells, thereby eliminating a flux cleaning step. The interconnect scheme utilizes a shingle style or\noverlapping design which covers the bus bar and thus provides a higher packing factor.\n\n5\n\n\t\n\nr,\n\n^\t\n\nN\t\n\nI\t\n\n\'"\n\n^\n\n1\n^\t\n\nI\n\nI\n\nE\'\t\n\nI\n\n^\t\n\nI\n\nI\t\nI\n\nI\n\n\t\n\nI^\n\n\tI\n\nc\n\n^\t\nI^\t\n\n^\n\na\n\ni\t\n\nI\t\n\n^\na\n\nc\t\n\nI\t\n\na\n\nc\n\no\t\n\n0\n\nn\n\nv\nc\n^o\nN\t\n\nI\n\nI\t\n\nW^`\t\nt ^.\n\nO\nO\n\nGO\n\n^\t\n\nd\n\n0\n\nri\n\nDO\n\n^\n\nr\n\nv\nO\n\nc\n\nw\n0\n\n-r\n\nd\n\ni\t\n\nI\t\n\nd\t\n\nI\t\n\nI\t\nI\n\n^\n\nI\t\n^\t\n\nf\n\n0\n^a\nJ\n\nI\n\nI\t\n\nI\n\nI\t\n\n^^\nCn\n\nI\n\n^; a\nI\t\n\nI\n\n\t\n\nA ^\t\n^L\n\nI\n\nM\n\nN\n.r\n\n6\n\nl\n\nitIGINAL PAGE IS\n\n0\n\n^\t\n\nV\n\nr\n\nr^\n\nM\n\nc\n\nV\t\n\nm M\n\nv\n\nc\n7\n\nto\n\nO\nH\n\nY q N\n\nVm\n\nN\nO\nd\nrt\nW\n\nR\n\na\n\n0\na\nN\nc\n\nv\n0\t\n\nv\n\nV\n\t\na A\n^_ m\n\t\nO\n\n^.`. .\n\nr\n\nU\n\nY p^\n,\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nI\n\nI\nI\n\n7\nm\n\nI\n\nGO ^\n\nC V\nuU\na\ncp\nc\no ^\nU C\nr \'L\n6 i f/1\nN\nr\n\nx\n\n^ a\naZ\nd^\n\nv\n\no ^a\n\nin\n\nm\n\n^\'\n\nI\nI\n\n^^ E\nY ^\nM.\n\nN\nCn\n11.\n\n\t0\nr\nN\n^\n\nA\nCL\n\no ^\n\nv ^\nr+ C\nN\n\n7\n\nA 1/1\nV \\D7\n\nN\nV\n\n^r\n\nn\nN\nN\nN\nA\n\nm\nU\n\nO\n\na\nA ^\n\nc\nE\n\n7\n\nc t7\nO W\n\n1=\n\n4-\n\nA\n\n0\n\nM\n\nv\nar\t\n\nc a\n\nM\t\n\nW\nq ^\n\n^\t\n\nu\n\nN\n^\n\nd\t\nQ.\t\n\n4\n\nc\nW\n\nc\n\nJ\t\n\nO\n3\n\nO\nC\n\n3N\n\nu\n\nM^\n\nI V1\nC\n\nw\nA\nV\nN\n\nfp\n\nv\nN\nT\nE\n3\nc\nE\n\n7\n\nA\n\nE\nA\n0\n\n4\n\nQ\n\nH\nV Q:\n\nU\n\nW\n\nO1\n\nd\n\nVi\n\nC\n\n0\t\n\nu\n\nN\n\n\t\n\nN\n\nN\n\n.w\nr+\n\nn\n0\n\nUP\n\nL\nU\n\nN\n\nH\n\nc\nfC\n\nr\nr0\n\nT\nR\nc\n0\nu\n\n61\nu\n\nc\n\na\n\nd\n\nD\n\nN\nO^\n\nN\n\n`M\n\nA\n\nC\n\nu\n\nN\n\nO\t\n\n_u W\n\n(\'t:i\t\n\ni\n\na\n\n0\n\nc\no\n\nn\n\na\n\nN\nV\n\n8\n\nti\n\nL_\n\n01t16LNAL PAGE\' 15\nOF PWR QUALITY\n\nV ^ r!\n\nFig. 4,\t\n\nCFG Array (Subinodules are 1 ft x 1 ft.

The low elastic modulus of the Sylgard\nallows differential expansion between the cells and the glass covers, Shock and\nvibration are also minimized, Sylgard provides electrical isolation between cells\nand module components, while its high transmissivity and refractive index provide\na good optical coupling between the front cover and the solar cells. The bonding\nsurfaces are first primed to ensure lood adhesion with the encapsulant.\n\n3.4 Module Cover and Substrate\n\nG\'tass was chosen as the cover and substrate material because it provides a hermetic barrier to environmental degradation agents, has an inherently low\ncoefficient of thermal expansion, provides excellent electrical isolation and provides a low cost package. ASG Sunadex glass 1/8 in. thick was selected for the\n\nfront cover because of its low iron oxide content and therefore high transmissivity\nover the wavelengths of interest. The substrate is 3/32 ir. ASG floatglass.\n\n3.5\t\n\nEdge Seals\n\nThe edge seal between the glass sheets is provided by a two component\n\nsystem. The primary seal against moisture is achieved with Tremco 750-55X polyisobutylene butyl. It is widely used in glazing insulating glass, can be applied with\na variety of techniques which are commercially available, and is low in cost. The\nsecondary seal is formed with GE IGS 3100 silicone sealant; it provides an excellent waver barrier in addition to bonding the glass to the aluminum rails. This\nsilicone sealant is also low in cost and readily applied, but a switch to a 2 part\nsilicone sealant is anticipated in the near future.\n\n3.6\t\n\nElectrical Terminals\n\nThe module electrical terminals are solder plated brass and are designed to provide an enctipsulant filling means without additional panel intrusion.\nAn alternative electrical termination method and encapsulant filling scheme are described in Section 5, Rear Terminal Redesign.\n\n3.7\t\n\nModule Structural Components\n\nThe structural strength for the four foot long module is provided by\nanodized aluminum extrusions along the sid,as of the module. End caps are used to\ngive edge support and protection.\n\n12\n\n4.0\t\n\nMODULE FABRICATION\n\n4.1\t\n\nInterconnection of Cells\n\nEFG solar cells are graded by current and voltage to improve module\nperformance by matching cells of similar characteristics. After testing, the cells\nhave the expanded copper mesh soldered to the bus bars; then the cells are overlapped\nand the mesh is soldered to the cell backs. Strings of 15 cells, formed in this way,\nare then checked for performance and matched with other strings for assembly into submodules. After the strings are series interconnected, the assembly is again checked\nfor performance.\n\n4.2\t\n\nCell Encapsulation\n\nThe cells are now placed on the substrate, leads are soldered to the\noutput terminals and the cover glass, to which the primary sealant has been applied,\nis set in place and the sealant compressed. Encapsulant is then introduced into the\nglass sandwich through the terminal studs. The filled submadule is allowed to cure\nand is then cleaned and its performance recorded for matching with other submodules.\n\n4.3 Module Assembly\n\nEnd caps of extruded aluminum are partially filled with silicone adhesive and positioned\n\non two of\n\nthe submodule sides. After the silicone has hardened,\n\nthe submodules are positioned into the side rails, in which additional silicone adhesive has been placed. After hardening of the adhesive the submodules are cleaned,\nelectrical leads are attached, and the final testing of the completed module is\nmade.\n\n13\n\n5.0\t\n\nREAR TERMINAL REDESIGN\n\nSome cracks in the glass substrates of the submodules were noted in the\nfirst three modules delivered to JPL. The delivery of the remaining modules was\npostponed to allow time to redesign and test a new electrical termination since the\ncracks appeared at the terminal holes. Two satisfactory solutions to the terminal\nhole cracking problem were achieved. The first was a revision of the terminal attachment procedure to ensure that both proper clearance between the stud and the hole\nis obtained, and that the mounting is resilient.\n\n5.1\t\n\nTerminal Mounting Design\n\nTesting of drilled glass samples revealed that the probable source of\nthe cracking problem was from the method of attachment rather than from the drilled\nhole itself. Therefore, a redesigned mounting procedure was selected which assured\ngood mechanical isolation between the terminal and the glass. A relatively thick\nbond of flexible epoxy attaches the terminal flange to the inside of the substrate,\nand a low durometer silicone rubber washer is inserted between the glass and the\nterminal washer and nut (see Fig. 6).\n\n5.2\t\n\nThrough-the-Seal Terminal Design\n\nA design to eliminate the drilled hole and terminal for the glass substrate was developed. The electrical termination is made by passing an insulated\nflat c:.iper braid through the edge seal and attaching it, with the interconnecting\nwires from other submodules, to the frame by means of a nylon strain relief (see\nFig. 7). An interim process has been developed for satisfactorily porting the encapsulant to the glass panel.\n\nMWORK961PA GA SLAMI NOT P%MEO.\n15\n\n+r\n3\n\n2\n^o\n\nL\nm\n4w\nIA\n\n40\nfC\n\nc\n\nCL\n\nE\n\nL\n\nH\n\n^o\nL\n\nm\n\nf^\n\na\n\nL\nZ\n\nN\n\nO\n\nL\n\nL\n\n3\n\n0\na\n\na^\n\nW\n\nO\n\nN\n\n41\n\nc\nr\nu\n\n.a\n\n^a\n\nry\nC\n\n^MN\n.mot"\t\n\nbA\nC_\n\na\n\n.Q\nF^\n\nC\n\nA\n\nO\n\na\n0\nL\na\n\nL\n\nC m\n\no s\n\n\'"\t\n\nv3\n\nc^\n\nN\n\nN\n^\\M\n\nt!\n\n16\n\no\n\na\n\nID\n\na,\n\n1\n\neo\n\nm\n\nCL\nN\na\nE\n\nu\n\na^\n\na\nCL\na\n\nu\nd\n\nA\n\nd\n\nv\n\n\'fl L\n\na c\n\nu\n\np\n\n\xc2\xab U\n0\nc^\n\n4\n\na\nN\nc\n\n_A\n7\n\nC\n\nE\nC1\n\nO\t\nN\n\nC\t\n\n7\t\n\ni\n\n^\n^\n\n\\\n\n^.\n\n^O\n\nU\n\nr\nW\t\n\nE\t\nc\n\nE\t\n\ni\nc\n\nu\n\n0\n^\n{\n\nl\n\n;^^\n\nIF\n\nv\n\n0\n\nN\nn\n\nL\n\n3\n\nm\n\nN\na\n\nLL.\n\ni\n\nv\nC\n\nu\n\nN\nCL\n\nO: iGi^ A^ P\nPCx*\nOF\'\n17\n\n^^i t Tv\n\n6.0\t\n\nTEST PROGRAM\n\n6.1\t\n\nIni.roduction\n\nThe testing program was carried out to ensure that the solar modules\nwould meet the necessary requirements of electrical performance and environmental\ndurability. Most of the testing was carried out at Mobil Tyco; the only exception\nwas the thermal cycling of completed modules, carried out in Wilmington, Massachusetts by Avco Environmental Testing Service. This was necessary because the inhouse environmental chamber was too small to accommodate the full-sized modules.\nElectrical testing consisted of performance and electrical isolation tests.\nBecause the long-arc Xenon simulator was not yet operational, all final performance\ntesting was made in natural sunlight. A conventional four-wire system connected\nthe modules to a load box, where the illuminated I-V curves were drawn using an X-Y\nrecorder. Submodule testing was automated in mid-July with a DEC PDP-11/03 microcomputer. Electrical isolation tests were made using a high voltage, programming\npower supply (KEPCO, Model ABC 1500 M).\nEnvironmental testing consisted of humidity and temperature cycling. A\ntemperature chamber (Conrad/Missner, Model FB1.5-120) was used to cycle submodules.\nMechanical stress tests were implemented with weighted sandbags.\n\n6.2\t\n\nCell Testing\n\nIndividual solar cells are tested on a temperature-controlled fixtunder two ELH simulator lamps. The fixture is interfaced with a DEC PDP 11/03\nmicrocomputer which checks the contact resistance, takes the measurements, stores\nthe data, and matches the cells for panel production on the basis of current at peak\npower. Shorted and poor-performance cells are rejected at this stage.\n\nr1\t\n\n^W(v^i(3,^ AC,E BLANK f=0{71\' \xe2\x80\xa2 B VAED\n\n19\n\nK\n\n6.3\t\n\nSubmodule Testing\n\nEach completed submodule first undergoes four cycles\n\n(24 hours) in\n\nthe temperature cycling chamber, in order to eliminate failures due to infant mortality. This has generally had no apparent effect an the perfor.^.iance or the appearance of the submodules, but in a few instances there has been some formation of air\nbubbles in the encapsulant.\nThe electrical performance tests have been carried out in natural sunlight,\nusing a calibrated reference cell to measure light intensity. Temperature control\nis achieved by allowing the covered submodules to core to thermal equilibrium with\nthe air. The I-V curves are measured immediately after the submodules are uncovered.\nUsing the air temperature, T , and the light intensity, E , the I-V data is\nadjusted to standard conditions (100 mW/cm 2 and\nV , and current, I\t\n\n280 C) with the following voltage,\n\ntransformations;\n\n+ a(28 - T)E\n\nI\'\t\n\n=\t\n\nI + I sc (100/E - 1)\n\nV\'\t\n\n=\t\n\nV + P( 28 - T ) N - R s (I\'\n\na\t\n\n- current temperature coefficient\n\na\t\n\n= voltage temperature coefficient\n\nRs\n\n=\t\n\nsubmodule series resistance\n\nN\t\n\n=\t\n\nnumber of series-connected cells in the submodule\n(generally 45).\n\n- 1)\n\nwhere\n\nThere is one small additional term, known as a curve correction term, which\nis often used in the voltage transformation to soften the knee of the I-V curve\nwith increased temperature. Data has been too scarce at this point to calculate\nthe value of this term, so it has not been used.\nInitial values for a, 0, and R s were calculated using data from several submodules mounted on the roof which have been measured under a variety of conditions.\nThese submodules, however, were constructed about a year ago and their design differs\nsubstantially from that of current submodules, so the initial values probably no\nlonger apply. JPL calculated values for\n\na and B using the three modules received\n\nin May; these values are in better agreement with the available literature and have\nbeen used subsequently. Both are listed below:\nSmA/ o C1100 mW/cm 2 )\t\noriginal value\t\nJPL value\t\n\n1.48\t\n0.544\t\n\n20\n\n(mV/oC/ccU)\n2.0\n2.2\n\nSubmodule series resistance is calculated for each submodule from the slope\nof the I-V curve at open circuit voltage. Values range from 1.5 to 3.5st, or about\n.03 to .07n/cell. Prior to the test automation, a value of 3.5si was used for all\nsubmodules, a value which has since proven to be too large.\nThe data printouts contain both raw and transformed data, as shown in Table 1.\nFigure 8 shows an example of the transformed curves which are used to match the submodules for assembly into modules. Module test data can be found in Tables 2 and 3.\nTable 2 compares MISEC and JPL data for the first three modules and Table 3 provides\ndata on the second three modules.\n6.4\t\n\nModule Testing at Mobil Tyco\n\n6.4.1\t\n\nElectrical\nElectrical performance tests were done in natural sunlight,and\n\ntransformations to standard conditions were made in the same way as for submodules.\nI-V curves were drawn with an X-Y recorder, however, since module current output is\nout of the range of the automatic data acquisition system.\nElectrical isolation and voltage withstanding tests were carried out on\neach completed module. After shorting the output terminals together, +1000 and\nthen -1000 volts was applied between the terminal and the frame for at least one\nminute for each polarity, checking that the current did not exceed 10 uA. Then\n1500 volts was applied and also held for at least one minute, checking that the\ncurrent did not exceed 50 nA. In general, the modules performed very well in these\ntests, showing less than 2 pA at 1500 volts.\n\n6.4.2\t\n\nEnvironmental\nHumidity cycling tests were made on eight submodules before\n\nthe beginning of the contract and showed no significant change in performance.\nThese tests have not been repeated on any recent modules.\n\n6.4.3\t\n\nMechanical\nThe mechanical integrity test was performed using a sandbag\n\nloading technique. Two hundred-forty pounds of sand in plastic bags was distributed\nover the raised module, representing an approximate load of 56.6 lbf/ft 2 . The load\nwas alternately placed on the front and back glass several times. Two modules were\nsubjected to this test; neither was damaged.\n\n21\n\nF"\n\nTable 1.\t\n\nSubmodule Data Summary\n\nRAW PANEL DATA\n\nDATE:\t\n\n9/6/78\n\nPanel No. Voc (V)\t\n\nI sc (A)\t\n\nPP (W)\t\n\nIncident Fower\n\n(mW/cm2)\n\nTemp.

The modules had high packing density and good efficiency\ndue to the inherent rectangular shape of EFG ribbon cells, The module design incorporated features that are applicable to low cost designs which can lead to the\nachievement of the $0,50 per peak watt goal.\nProblems with the cracking of the substrate were eliminated by redesign of\nthe electrical terminations. Two solutions were developed, both of which will be\nconsidered for future designs. Module efficiencies exceeding 9" have been achieved\nusing current generation EFG silicon ribbon solar cells.\n\n27\n\n'
