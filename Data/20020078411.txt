The growth of automated parts control has been restricted by\n..\nthe fact-that r$eat/many tiny or unusually-shaped parts cannot be marked with conventional\nbar:cades such those used in supermarkets. Some parts - a screw or an electronic diode,\n"\nfor example\ntoo small to accommodate a printed code label; others must operate in\n"\nharsh, high temperature environments in which a bar code could not survive.\n\' hat 4;s a particular problem for NASA\'s Marshall Space Flight Center, which was looking\nfajmimproved method of identifying and tracking Space Shuttle parts. There was need for a\ntechnique of marking parts so that NASA could readily check the specifications, manufacturing\nhistory and operational experience data of any single part among the hundreds of thousands\nin the Shuttle system. And the PID symbol had to be able to withstand operating temperature\nconditions ranging from minus 250 degrees Fahrenheit to more than 2,000 degrees.\nNASA found a possible solution in a technology then under early development by a small\nbusiness firm, Veritec, Inc., Calabasas, California. Veritec was experimenting with a space efficient binary marking known as the Vericode SymbolTM could contain a great deal more\nthat\ninformation than a bar code yet occupy substantially less space; and could easily be marked\non a part\'s surface for permanent identification.\nIn May 1991, NASA organized a team to further develop the technology and create an\nadvanced PID system that would be targeted specifically at Space Shuttle parts identification\nbut would also be capable of spinoff applications in pharmaceutical, medical, automotive and\nelectronics manufacturing, product distribution and consumer product use. The team included Marshall Space Flight Center, Veritec and Rockwell International, NASA\'s prime contractor\nfor the Space Shuttle.\nThe Shuttle-oriented work is still in progress, but the technology has advanced significantly. In cooperation with major firms in several industries, the team has developed marking\ntechniques for many types of parts and a wide range of materials - steel, paper, glass, fabric,\nceramics, plastic, metal, etc.\nMeanwhile, Veritec introduced the Vericode Symbol to\nthe commercial marketplace in 1994. The company is\nmarketing its VeriSystemTM, complete identification and\na\ntracking system for component traceability, improved\nmanufacturing and processing capabilities, and a variety of\nautomated shop floor applications.\nINDUSTRIAL\n\nto industrial productivi-\n\nP\n\n9\n\nare\n\nw\n\n(3\n\nU\nz\nz\n\nk\n\n0\n\nPC\n\nI=\nU\nw\nI\nw\n\n108\n\nPRODUCTIVITY\n\nThis photo illuswates the great\nmany types of\nsmd and unusually\nshaped products\nthat can be\nmarked with the\nVericode Symbol. A\nspinaf of Space\nShuttle technology,\nthe matking technique represents a\nmajor advancement in automated\npa* tracking.\n\nThe Vericode symbol is a small, checkerboard-likematrix, ranging in size from fractions of\nan inch to several feet. Each symbol can contain 5 to 100 or more coded characters, which can\nprovide up to 100 times as much information as a bar code in the same or less space. The\nsmallest Vericodes, read with a microscope, are measured in microns (millionths of a meter).\nVericodes are scanned by CCD (charge coupled device) electronic cameras that can capture\nimages from a broad range of surfaces. NASA tests have shown that the Vericode Symbol can\nbe read with a high degree of accuracy. The Vericode\'s direct PID capability also enables\nbypassing processing steps that introduce human error.\nThe "compressed symbology" technology clearly has enormous potential for efficiencyand\ncost savings. The applications and methodology vary widely from one possible use to another,\nbut one major example serves to underline the system\'s utility: labeling automotive parts.\nToday, when a manufacturer discovers a defect in a particular batch of auto parts, the company has little information on which autos are specifically affected. Therefore, it becomes necessary to recall thousands o vehicles for inspections,when only a few might really be affected. A\nf\nVericode Svmbol on a defective Dart might\ninclude such details as the manufacturer,\nserial number, the lot number o the parent\nf\nmaterial, design changes, special processing\nto which the part was subjected -everything\nneeded to determine, accurately and automatically, the extent of the recall needed, which\nmight be a couple of hundred cars instead of\ntens of thousands. The savings in time,\nconvenience and money are obvious. There is\nsimilar savings potential in an ever-broadening\nspectrum o applications ranging from markf\ning pharmaceuticalvials to tracing instances\nof food poisoning by marking live hogs.\n\nA typical a p p I t c ~\ntion, use ofthe\nVericade Symbol\non pharmaceutical\nvials.
