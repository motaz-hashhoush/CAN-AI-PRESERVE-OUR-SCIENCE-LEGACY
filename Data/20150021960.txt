b"Management of Asymptomatic Renal Stones in Astronauts\nDavid Reyes, MD, MPH, and James Locke, MD, MPH\n\nIntroduction\nManagement guidelines were created to screen and manage asymptomatic renal stones in U.S. astronauts.\nThe risks for renal stone formation in astronauts due to bone loss and hypercalcuria are unknown. Astronauts\nhave a stone risk which is about the same as commercial aviation pilots, which is about half that of the general\npopulation. However, proper management of this condition is still crucial to mitigate health and mission risks in\nthe spaceflight environment.\n\nMethods\nAn extensive review of the literature and current aeromedical standards for the monitoring and management of\nrenal stones was done. The NASA Flight Medicine Clinic's electronic medical record and Longitudinal Survey\nof Astronaut Health were also reviewed. Using this work, a screening and management algorithm was created\nthat takes into consideration the unique operational environment of spaceflight.\n\nResults\nRenal stone screening and management guidelines for astronauts were created based on accepted standards\nof care, with consideration to the environment of spaceflight. In the proposed algorithm, all astronauts will\nreceive a yearly screening ultrasound for renal calcifications, or mineralized renal material (MRM). Any areas\nof MRM, 3 mm or larger, are considered a positive finding. Three millimeters approaches the detection limit of\nstandard ultrasound, and several studies have shown that any stone that is 3 mm or less has a ~95% change\nspontaneous passage. For mission-assigned astronauts, any positive ultrasound study is followed by low-dose\nrenal computed tomography (CT) scan, and flexible ureteroscopy if CT is positive. Other specific guidelines\nwere also created.\n\nDiscussion\nThe term \xe2\x80\x9cMRM\xe2\x80\x9d is used to account for small areas of calcification that may be outside the renal collecting\nsystem, and allows objectivity without otherwise constraining the diagnostic and treatment process for\npotentially very small calcifications of uncertain significance. However, a small asymptomatic MRM or stone\nwithin the renal collecting system may become symptomatic, and so affect launch and flight schedules, cause\nincapacitation during flight, and ultimately require medical evacuation. For exploration class missions,\nevacuation is unlikely. The new screening and management algorithm allow better management of mission\nrisks, and will define the true incidence of renal stones in U.S. astronauts. This information will be used to\nrefine future screening, countermeasures and treatment methods; and will also inform the needed capabilities\nto be flown on exploration-class missions.\n\n"
