The scientific objectives included geological surveying and sampling of materials and surface features in a preselected area of the Taurus-Littrow region, deploying and activating surface experiments, and conducting inflight experiments and photographic tasks during lunar orbit and transearth coast. The individual Apollo 17 experiments and photographic tasks are presented in outline form. Charts are developed to show the major mission events and data collection periods correlated to Greenwich Mean Time and ground elapsed time. Maps of the lunar surface ground track envelope for the Apollo 17 orbiting spacecraft for revolutions one to seventy-five is shown.", "title": "Mission description", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-07T14:26:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19740010318, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Baldwin, R.
