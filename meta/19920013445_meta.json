The improved tests are tailored to identify equipment design and workmanship problems without inducing artificial failures that would not have occurred at launch. These new, less destructive types of vibration tests are essential to JPL's protoflight test approach in which lab testing is conducted using the flight equipment, often one of a kind, to save time and money. In conventional vibration tests, only the input vibratory motion is specified; the feedback, or reaction force, between the test item and the vibration machine is ignored. Most test failures occur when the test item goes into resonance, and the reaction force becomes very large. It has long been recognized that the large reaction force is a test artifact which does not occur with the lightweight, flexible mounting structures characteristic of spacecraft and space vehicles. In new vibration tests, both the motion and the force provided to the test item by the vibration machine are controlled, so that the vibration ride experienced by the test item is as in flight.", "title": "Force limited vibration testing", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T17:18:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19920013445, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Scharton, Terry D."}, "organization": {"name": "Jet Propulsion Lab., California Inst. of Tech.", "location": "Pasadena, CA, United States"}}, "id": "36051f6263564ef8b686b50bdeb143f3"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19920013445, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19920013445, "id": "1461b48279b749d1a358d4bfe00b0907", "publicationName": "NASA, Washington, Technology 2001: The Second National Technology Transfer Conference and Exposition, Volume 2", "publicationDate": "1991-12-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19920013445.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19920013445/downloads/19920013445.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19920013445/downloads/19920013445.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19920013445/downloads/19920013445.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
