The code\n\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\n\nis the original work of Dr. Bird of The Department of Aeronautical Engineering,\nUniversity of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.\n\nDr. Karr has been in close\n\ncommunication with Dr. Bird and advice on needed changes has been obtained.\n\nThe\n\nfollowing discusses the code, the modifications needed, and the plans for making\nthe changes.\nThe direct simulation Monte Carlo method is a method for solving the\nBoltzman Equation using an approximation to the collision integral term. The\ncollision integrand is evaluat.ed for randomly selected values of its arguments\nand the summation will approach the integral for large enough samples. The\ncollision effects may be modeled for either hard sphere or various power law\npotentials. The convective side of the Boltzman equation is approximated over a\ntime step using a simple trajectory calculation of molecules as they travel\nthrough the domain of interest. The Bird code is widely use in rarefied gas\n\nI\nI\n\n94\n\nb\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\n1\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\n\nflow calculations and should be useful in the simulation of the wake shield flow\nproblem. The boundary conditions for the code are the changes required for our\napplication.\nThe domain boundary conditions are of importance in the application of the\nBird code in order to properly represent the effect of the gas-surface effects\non the shield. The results we have obtained to present show a region of\nenhanced density in front of the shield due to the thermalization of ambient\nmolecules that hit the shield. After hitting the shield the velocity i s likely\nreduced to a much smaller value than the 8-km/s incident value. This reduction\nin velocity coupled with possible directional effects of the surface interaction\nmakes the shield boundary an important surface in the calculation. Presently we\nuse a very simple model of the gas-surface interaction and see a considerable\nbuild-up of molecules in front of the shield. This region of enhanced density\ninteracts with the incident flow to cause scattering into the high vacuum region\nbehind the shield. Since this effect could be a limiting factor on the vacuum\nthat can be obtained, we have begun to modify the Bird program to take into\naccount more realistic gas-surface interaction results that have been described\nin previous reports.\nOur plans for modifying the Bird code will require that the method used in\nthe calculation of the effect of collision with the solid boundaries be changed.\nWe are presently working with Dr. Bird to best handle these changes. The work\n\nwill require that the experimentally determined interaction be modeled in a\nparameter form that can be randomly sampled. Work has begun on this effort and\nresults should be available during the next reporting period.\n\n95\n\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\n\nAnother change in the Bird program that is being addressed is the need to\ngive results in the form of directorial flux rather than number density. The\nuse of directional flux is of more importance to the region behind the shield so\nthat the orientation of experiments can be studied. We have discussed this modification with Dr. Bird and expect t o have results available by the next reporting period.\n\n96\n\n'
