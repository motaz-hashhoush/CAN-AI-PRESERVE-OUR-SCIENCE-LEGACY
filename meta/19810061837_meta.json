A list of spacecraft that have made significant contributions to an understanding of the near-earth geomagnetic field is presented. A new era in near-earth magnetic field measurements began with NASA's launch of Magsat in October 1979. Attention is given to geomagnetic field modeling, crustal magnetic anomaly studies, and investigations of the inner earth. It is concluded that satellite-based magnetic field measurements make global surveys practical for both field modeling and for the mapping of large-scale crustal anomalies. They are the only practical method of accurately modeling the global secular variation. Magsat is providing a significant contribution, both because of the timeliness of the survey and because its vector measurement capability represents an advance in the technology of such measurements.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"submissionId": 19810061837, "endDate": "1981-03-27T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Astronautical Society"}}, "meetingId": "4dffe1c07f0d42f992125d1b1c1a9027", "id": "854aefccfc4b49a8826f2b01d4b53780"}], "name": "Goddard Memorial Symposium on International Space Technical Applications", "location": "Arlington, VA", "id": "4dffe1c07f0d42f992125d1b1c1a9027", "startDate": "1981-03-26T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 19810061837, "id": "9f2ad0707dfa4e99a9cf7f3fdabef653", "publicationDate": "1981-03-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
