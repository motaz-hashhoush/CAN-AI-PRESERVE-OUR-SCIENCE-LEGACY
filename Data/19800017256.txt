b'APPLICATION OF SNOWCOVERED AREA TO RUNOFF FORECASTING IN SELECTED\nBASINS OF THE SIERRA NEVADA, CALIFORNIA\n\nA. J. Brown, California Department of Water Resources, Sacramento\nJ. F. Hannaford, R. L. Hall, Sierra Hydrotech, Placerville, CA\n\nABSTRACT\nThe California Applications Systems Verification and\nTransfer (ASVT) project, one of four ASVT\'s sponsored\nby NASA in the western United States, established two\nstudy areas covering the range of conditions found in\nCalifornia. These study areas were used to map SCA in\nnear real-time mode; to compare satellite derived SCA\nwith conventional snow data; and to operationally test\nthe effects of incorporating SCA into the state\'s forecasts of snowmelt runoff. Results obtained during the\nfour years of the ASVT indicate a potential improvement\nin the forecast accuracy by introducing SCA for those\nwatersheds having a limited amount of representative\nreal-time data during the period of snowmelt. Cloud\ncover and timely receipt of imagery were the major\nlimitations to the usefulness of SCA.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nThe National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has\nbeen sponsoring research and investigation into utility of satellite imagery in water supply and other hydrologic forecasting in\nthe western United States in the form of Applications Systems Verification and Transfer (ASVT) projects. NASA has contracted with\nthe California Department of Water Resources (DWR) to investigate\nthe operational application of snowcovered area from satellite\nimagery to DWR\'s hydrologic forecasting responsibilities, primarily in water supply forecasting in the Sierra Nevada. DWR subcontracted with Sierra Hydrotech, a consulting firm in Placerville,\nCalifornia, for technical assistance in determining snowcovered\narea (SCA) from satellite imagery, and in investigating applications of SCA to hydrology.\nThe objective of this paper is to report on the results and\nconclusions arrived at during the four years of the California\nASVT project.\n\n185\n\nBackground\nThe Sierra Nevada and the southern portion of the Cascade\nRange supply California\'s fertile San Joaquin and Sacramento\nValleys with water for agricultural, municipal, and industrial\nuse. The average water-year runoff of Sierra streams tributary to\nthe San Joaquin Valley and Tulare Lake Basin is approximately\n11 million cubic dekametres (9 million acre-feet), while the\naverage water-year runoff of Sierra and Southern Cascade streams\ntri^utary to the Sacramento Valley is approximately 19 million\ndam\' (15 million ac-ft). In southern Sierra streams where elevations range up to about 4 300 metres (14,000 feet), as much as 75\npercent of the average annual runoff occurs during the April-July\nsnowmelt season. In the northern Sierra streams where elevations\nare much lower, only about 40 to 50 percent of the average annual\nrunoff occurs during the snowmelt season.\nThe high degree of development and use of water in\nCalifornia\'s Central Valley has required development of forecast\ntechniques for predicting volume and time-distribution of snowmelt\nrunoff for water management purposes. Water management problems\nin certain areas require continual surveillance of streamflow and\nupdating of forecasts during the runoff season to provide for\nmanagement decisions as the season progresses. Forecast technology has advanced to the degree that application of new data\ntypes may possibly generate only limited improvement in forecast\naccuracy, particularly early in the season when forecast error is\nhighly dependent upon the precipitation which occurs after the\ndate of forecast. Development of new data types, such as snowcover from satellite imagery, will not eliminate the necessity or\nadvisability of collecting data on precipitation, snowpack water\ncontent, and rates of snowpack accumulation and melt in the foreseeable future.\nObjectives\nThe basic objective of the California ASVT was to explore\nwithin an operational time frame the application of SCA obtained\nfrom satellite imagery in the State\'s snowmelt runoff forecasting\nprocedures. Three specific tasks or areas of investigation were\ndefined.\n1.\n\nData Interpretation. This task involved mapping SCA and\nequivalent snow lines from historic satellite and aircraft observations; and in a near real-time operational\nmode when the satellite imagery was available within 72\nhours of satellite passage.\n\n2.\n\nData Analysis. This task involved developing and applying\ntechniques to estimate SCA and to check the data. It\nfurther involved comparing imagery from various conventional and satellite sources to refine interpretative\n\n186\n\ntechniques and to determine compatibility to SCA derived\nfrom satellite imagery with aircraft observations and\nother pertinent snowcover information.\n3. Data Application. This task involved incorporating SCA\noperationally into volumetric projections of water year\nand snowmelt season (April-July) runoff, and investigating the use of SCA to refine and update a continuing\nanalysis of the rates and remaining volume of snowmelt\nrunoff during the progress of snowmelt.\nArea of Investigation\nThe geographical area of this investigation is California\'s\nSierra Nevada. The study area selected by DWR was composed of a\nnorthern and a southern project area. The northern project area\nincluded 24 watersheds and subwatersheds in or adjacent to the\nSacramento River above Shasta Dam and the Feather River above\nOroville Dam. The southern project area included 14 watersheds\nand subwatersheds in or adjacent to the San Joaquin, Kings, Kaweah,\nTule, and Kern River Basins. The southern project area represented\nthe relatively high elevation "high Sierra" region and the northern\nproject area was characterized by lower elevations and more transient areas of snowcover. (Note that the Sacramento River Basin\ntechnically lies to the north of the Sierra in the Cascade Range.)\nFigure 1 shows the locations of these basins.\nINTERPRETATION OF HISTORIC SCA DATA\nTechniques described by Barnes and Bowley, 1974, were adapted\nto interpretative problems encountered in the Sierra project areas.\nProblems related to reflectivity of the bare, light colored granite\nrocks were critical in the southern Sierra, while problems related\nto timber cover, extensive cloud cover, and long shadows were most\ncritical in the north. During the initial phases of the project,\nhistorical imagery obtained from NASA was interpreted for the 38\nwatersheds and subwatersheds within and adjacent to the Sierra\nproject areas. Watersheds var^ in size from 100 square kilometres\n(40 square miles) to 16 600 km (6,400 mi ). Determining SCA\nsimultaneously from a relatively large number of basins and subbasins in each study area permitted crosschecking between adjacent\nand nearby basins, thus providing a means of estimating snowcover\nconditions even when portions of a given project area were obscured by clouds.\nBy 1978, preanalysis and editing of interpreted data indicated that sufficient historic information has been obtained from\nmost of the subwatersheds for investigative purposes. As a consequence, analysis of many subbasins was discontinued and the program for acquisition, reduction and interpretation of satellite\nimagery was expanded to meet the future operational needs of DWR.\nNASA provided historic Landsat data so that 22 major watersheds in\n\n187\n\n\t\n\n25\'\t\n\n1249\t\n\n23\t\n\n121*\t\n\n122-\t\n\n20\'\n\n42\t\n\n42\n42\'\n\n\'LOCATION MAP\n91\n\n\t\n\nAF\nB4\nAPPLICATIONS SYSTEMS\n\nVERIFICATION TEST (ASVT)\nVERIFICATION\nSHOWING\n\nUPPER\t\nSACRAMENTO\t\n\n(\n\n40\t\n\nBASINS AND SUB-BASINS\nOF THE\n\n40\n\n^\nC A L IFORNIA\n\nSTUDY\n\nAREA\n\nIFEATHER\n31\n\n38\n\n30.\n\nSAN FRANCISCO\n\n37\n\n49\n\nSAN 3 7AOUIN\n\n0,\t\n\nKINGS\n\nKAWEAH\n48\n\nTUL E\t\n\nI\n\n, 2 2-\t\n\n35*\t\n\nl\t\n\nKERN\t\n\n35\'\n\n47\n\n0\n\n34\xc2\xb0\n\nI\nLO\n\n34.\n\nS ANGELES\t\n\n\t\n21\'\n1204\t 6\nss\n\n3\n\n45\n\n\t117\'\n\n44\t\n\n6.\t\n\t\n\n43\t\n\n42\n\nFigure 1.

See\nFigure 2.\nHistoric data were initially reduced from Landsat images by\nboth overlay and Zoom Transfer Scope (ZTS). Comparison of results\nindicated that reduction of Landsat images at a scale of 1:500,000\nusing the ZTS gives more consistent results, but takes considerably\nmore time than a 1:1,000,000 direct overlay. NOAA images were\nalso reduced by ZTS to fill the period between Landsat images.\nIn the reduction of Landsat imagery, the following items\nhave been noted:\n1.\n\nTransparencies of the Landsat imagery appear to be more\nconsistent and more easily interpreted on the ZTS than\nthe prints.\n\n2.\n\nDirect overlay onto 1:1,000,000 prints takes about onethird the time of 1:500,000 ZTS analysis using transparencies, but the consistency of results observed using\nthe transparencies has reduced the time required for\ndata analysis.\n\n3.\n\nLandsat imagery received well after the fact on transparencies is decidedly better and more easily interpreted\nthan the near real-time data from Quick Look, or imagery\nfrom other sources such as NOAH.\n\nFor purposes of this investigation, an image set was defined\nas an image or group of images representing a nominal time of\nobservation. NOAA images which cover much of the western United\nStates in a single image have only one image per image set. A\nsingle NOAA image set includes all of California, but data were\ninterpreted from two enlarged prints, each covering a portion of\nthe Sierra. Landsat image sets may have included up to eleven\nimages taken over a period of six days to cover the snowmelt\nstreams of the State. The image set for a given basin or area\nrepresents all images required to describe that area on a given\nnominal date of observation.\nInterpreted data representing a basin day includes the snowcovered area and effective snow line of a given basin or subbasin\nfor a given image set. The overlap of images on succeeding passes\nprovides an opportunity to obtain observational data when storm\nactivity and clouds may obscure a single pass. Some data sets\nhave been reinterpreted as techniques were improved. A significant portion of the imagery received but not interpreted was\neither obscured by cloud cover, had no remaining snow, or was\noutside the time period of investigation.\n\n189\n\nLOCATION MAP\nMAJOR SNOWMELT WATERSHEDS\nIN CALIFORNIA\n\nSCOTT\n\nUppzk .\nCRAMENTO, :\n\nTRINITY\nINITIAL ASVT STUDY AREA\n""\'111JJ1\nFE/1TFiER\n\nTRUCKEE\t\n40\t\n\nYUBA\n\nSa \t\n\n80\n\nTAHOE\nCARSON\n\nAMERICAN\nCOSUMNES\t\nMOKELUMN\nFrancisco\n\nScale of hides\n40\t\n0\t\n\nnacre\t\n\nWALKER\n\nto\n\nSTANI\t AUS\nTUOL\t NE\n.modest\n\nSAN J\t\n\nMERGED\nOUIN\n\nKINGS\',\n\nK AN/ E AH\nERN\n\nITUL *\'\t\n\nN\n\nBakersfield\n\nn Los Angeles\n\nFigure 2. Major Snowmelt Watersheds in California\n\n190\n\nINTERPRETATION OF OPERATIONAL SCA DATA\nCanadian Quick Look imagery from Landsat was obtained\ndirectly from Integrated Satellite Information Services (ISIS), a\nCanadian readout station and service, during the snowpack accumulation and melt periods of 1976 through 1979 for use in operational forecasting. Additionally, Quick Look Landsat imagery was\nobtained from NASA.\nOne of the major operational problems during the 1978 and\n1979 snowmelt seasons was securing timely imagery when runoff\nforecasts were required. Perhaps the greatest delay during 1978\nwas caused by the mail service. Canadian Quick Look imagery was\npostmarked in a timely fashion after observation, but mail delivery was much slower than in past seasons. Quick Look from NASA\nusually, but not always, arrived after the Canadian Quick Look.\nThe average time was about five to six days as compared to the 72\nhours originally hoped for. During 1979, data handling problems\nearly in the season made it impossible to obtain near real-time\ndata. NOAA and GOES imagery were used for supplemental data or\nwhen real-time data from Landsat was not available. Timeliness of\ndata delivery cannot be overstressed with regard to operational\nforecasts.\nDATA ANALYSIS\nEvaluation of results indicated that SCA can be practically\ndetermined from Landsat using the Zoom Transfer Scope for watersheds as small as 100 km 2 (40 mi 2 ), and snowpack depletion may he\ndetermined within reasonable limits of accuracy even as the area\nof snowpack becomes fragmented. Cross-basin plots were developed\nfor the various major basins and subbasins, making it possible to\nestimate SCA on watersheds that were partly or completely cloud\ncovered from data available on adjacent basins or subbasins.\nInterpretative techniques improved with the increase in experience of the interpreter. A considerable amount of time was\nspent in checking and reanalyzing early (1973-1976) data sets to\nprovide a data base for all watersheds that was homogeneous\nthroughout the entire six-year period of available satellite imagery. This process included the important step of editing and\npreanalysis of the data, which involved deciding whether the data\nbeing obtained represented the data needed.\narison of Satellite and Aircraft Observations\nDuring the heavy snow season of 1952, the U. S. Army Corps\nof Engineers (Sacramento) initiated observations of snowcovered\narea from low flying aircraft in the southern Sierra Nevada in\nconnection with the operation of reservoirs during the period of\nsnowmelt. Initial work was done in the Kings River Basin for\noperation of Pine Flat Reservoir. Observations extended to the\n\n191\n\nKern River in 1954, and eventually included the Kaweah and Tule\nRiver Basins. Observations were taken more or less routinely\nduring the period of major snowmelt. The program continued for\nabout 20 years until 1973.\nDuring 1978, the Corps resumed aircraft observations in the\nsouthern Sierra as the result of the unusually heavy snowpack\nconditions and potential for spill of snowmelt runoff from reservoirs. Although the Corps was furnished data from the satellite\nobservations throughout the ASVT program, the data generally arrived in Sacramento too late to meet the Corps\' requirements for\nforecasting, necessitating resumption of the aircraft observations\nfor that heavy runoff year. Information on SCA for estimation of\nboth rate and volume of snowmelt runoff was obtained from aircraft\nand satellite. In many cases, aircraft observations varied considerably from the satellite observations. Figure 3(a) delineates\nthe snowcovered area in the Kings River Basin during the 1973\nseason as derived from Landsat imagery, NOAA imagery, and aircraft\nobservations. Figure 3(b) delineates snowcovered area during 1978\nseason, including the Canadian Quick Look imagery. Data in 1973\nand 1978 for the Kern River Basin appears in Figures 4(a) and\n4(b), and similar results were noted on other watersheds.\nIt will be noted that in general, the aircraft observations\nin 1978 appeared to show less snowcover than satellite observations as of a given date. Some precipitation occurred about midJune 1978 which included light snowfall at higher elevations, and\nwas probably very apparent to observers at that time. The Corps\nof Engineers attributes the difference between aircraft observations and Satellite SCA to the following possible causes:\n1.\n\nAircraft observers deleted patches of snow that were below\nthe major unbroken snowpack. Historical aircraft observations, however, may not be entirely consistent in this\nrespect.\n\n2.\n\nAircraft observers tried to delete areas with fresh light\nsnowpack which did not represent the major winter accumulation. These areas might show up as snowcovered area on\nthe satellite imagery, but an observer close to the ground\ncould identify the freshly fallen snow on bare ground and\neliminate it from the observation.\n\n3.\n\nAircraft observers and methods changed at various times.\n\nDuring analysis, it was arbitrarily decided to make a correction to all aircraft observed data by increasing the aircraft\nobservations by eight percent on the Kings River and 14 percent on\nthe Kern River. Obviously, there is no means for otherwise\ntesting or adjusting aircraft observations prior to the availability of satellite imagery.\n\n192\n\nFigure 3A\nIzo\nRa\n\nIOC\n\n^ P\n90\nI\n\n80\nI\n\nz ^\n\nw\xc2\xb0 30\n0 9d\n3\na\n\n^\n\nSNOW COVERED AREA\n\nKINGS RIVER BASIN 1973\nm\n\nIN\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 LANDSAT\n7 NOAA\n6 CORPS OF ENGINEERS SNOW FLIG\n1\n\nc\nto z\t\nJANUARY\t\n\nfERRIIART\t\n\nNARCX\t\n\nAPRIL\t\n\nMAY\t\n\n,NNE\t\n\nJULY\t\n\nAUGII RT\n\nFigure 3 B\n\nR\n\nlto\n\nN zo 30\n\n10\n\nloo\n\n90^\n\nJ\no\ntil ^\n2\n^6d\ntt\nQ\n\nW 501\n\nO\n\nv ad\nz\n10\n\nSNOW COVERED AREA\n30(\n\nzoI\n\nlac\n\nKINGS RIVER BASIN 1978\n\xe2\x80\xa2 LAND T\no CANA IAN WICK LOCK\nN AA\n,7 CORP OF ENGINEER SNOW FLIGHT\n\n0\n20 30\t\n10\t\nJANUARY\t\n\np\t\n20\t\nFEBRUARY\t\n\np\t\n20 3\t\nMARCH\t\n\n10 20 3\t\nMAY\t\n\n10 20\t\nAPRIL\t\n\n10 20\t\nJUNE\t\n\nFigure 3.

Snowcovered Areas\n\n194\n\nR3\t\n20\t\nJULY\n\n3\n\n20\nAUGUST\n\nDATA APPLICATION\nAlthough utilization of snowcovered area as a supplemental\nparameter in seasonal runoff predictions seems logical and has\nbeen shown by various investigators to be useful (Rango, et al,\n1979), the duration of satellite data is too short for conclusive\ntesting of SCA in most conventional approaches to water supply\nforecasting. In order to expeditiously investigate the potential\nvalue of satellite SCA data in runoff prediction, long-term aircraft observations of SCA were used as a parameter in testing\noperational forecasting procedures for the Kings and Kern River\nwatersheds in the southern Sierra Nevada.\nTest Basins\nThe Kings and Kern Rivers are adjacent watersheds (Figure 2)\nin the southern Sierra, ranging in elevation from about 300 metres\n(1,000 feet) in the foothill areas to over 4 300 metres (14,000\nfeet) along the Sierra crest, which is the eastern boundary for\nboth watersheds. The Kings River has an east-west orientation\nwith high subbasin divides and subbasin drainage in deep canyons.\nThe Kern River has a north-south orientation with the Sierra crest\nalong the eastern drainage boundary and the similarly high Great\nWestern Divide along the western boundary of the basin. The Kern\nRiver is characterized by plateau areas with broad meadow areas\nand timbered slopes, although the North Fork heads in the steep\nrocky areas near the Kings-Kern divide and flows in the deep canyons for most of its length to Lake Isabella. About 74 percent of\nthe Kings River annual runoff of about 2 million dam 3 (1.6 million\nac-ft) occurs during the April-July snowmelt period. About 673\npercent of the average Kern River annual runoff of 773,000 dam\n(627,000 ac-ft) occurs during the April-July snowmelt.\nTest Procedures\nIn a preliminary analysis, a multiple regression technique\nwas utilized to relate runoff subsequent to the date of forecast\nto causitive parameters. The analysis was intended to develop and\ndemonstrate a procedure for updating water supply forecasts during\nthe period of snowmelt to reflect observed conditions of precipitation, runoff, and change in SCA with the intention of reducing\nthe residual error in the remaining flow subsequent to date of\nforecast.\nThe analysis was predicated on the operational requirement\nfor accurate updating of water supply forecasts throughout the\nperiod of snowmelt runoff. Forecasts prepared by DWR have historically been for April-July snowmelt period. Updating has been\nprimarily on the basis of precipitation observed subsequent to the\nApril 1 forecast. Only a limited amount of data is available from\nthe high mountain watersheds on a continuing basis during the\nperiod of snowmelt. Observed precipitation, runoff, and depletion\n\n195\n\nof SCA as the melt season progresses provide parameters on a near\nreal-time basis to reflect the progress of melt in the watersheds.\nThis investigation developed and demonstrated usable techniques\nfor updating the conventional DWR forecast procedures during the\nprogress of snowmelt.\nThe updating procedures used the same data as the conventional DWR procedures, which includes high and low elevation snow\nindexes (based on snow water content measurements), October-March\nprecipitation index, precipitation during the period of snowmelt,\nand previous year\'s April-July runoff. In addition, the updating\nprocedures included the runoff from April 1 through date of forecast, and SCA as of the date of forecast.\nFigure 5 illustrates the variation in standard error, expressed as a percentage of April-July runoff, for forecast updatEs,\nand depicts the effective reduction in forecast error as the melt\nseason progresses. Updating procedures without SCA are shown as a\ndashed line, while updating procedures utilizing SCA are shown as\na solid line. On the Kings River, standard error increased\nslightly between April 1 and May 1, probably as a result of additional forecast parameters (observed runoff and SCA) used subsequent to April 1 which increased the degrees of freedom lost.\nAfter May 1, standard error declined appreciably until on June 15\nit was approximately 70 percent of the error on April. The addition of SCA as a parameter on the Kings River appeared to offer\nlittle significant improvement in procedural error during the\nmelt season. On the Kern River, standard error declined as the\nseason progressed, but inclusion of SCA as a parameter appeared to\nmake a substantial decrease in volumetric error of remaining runoff as the season progressed.\nThe analysis indicated that use of SCA as a parameter in\nforecasting snowmelt runoff may result in significant improvement\nof forecasting procedures under certain circumstances. It may be\nhypothesized that watershed characteristics, as well as availability of data representative of the watershed, may be factors\nrelated to response of forecast procedures to SCA. Historically,\nforecast errors on the Kern River have been substantially larger\n(percentage-wise) than those on the Kings River. Inclusion of SCA\nduring the period of snowpack depletion allowed forecast accuracy\non the two watersheds to be brought more in line with each other\nthan was possible with conventional parameters alone. This suggests that SCA provides information pertinent to updating forecasts under some circumstances which may not be readily available\nfrom other basic data investigated here.\nDuring the 1978 season, a forecast procedure using SCA was\ndeveloped for the Kaweah River Basin which is adjacent to both the\nKings and Kern River Basins. This procedure was developed specifically for operational use during the unusual 1978 snowmelt season..\n\n196\n\n\t\n\nSTANDARD ERROR OF\nFORECAST PROCEDURE\nVS\n\nDATE DURING SNOWMELT\nKINGS RIVER\nAVE.

Standard Error of Forecast Procedure vs. Date\nDuring Snowmelt\n\n197\n\nOperational Forecasting\nWater supply forecasts utilizing SCA as a forecast parameter\nwere prepared during the snowmelt period for the 1977 and 1978\nwater years (Howard and Hannaford, 1979).\n1977-California experienced the driest water year of record on\nmost streams during 1977, following the near record dry 1976 water\nyear. Snowcovered area observed was by far the smallest for any\nseason for which observations were available. By May 1 the snow\nline was at an unprecedented high elevation of 3 000 m (10,000 ft).\nRelatively cold storm activity during May lowered the snow line to\nbelow 2 100 m (7,000 ft). The amount of water content in the\nfresh snowpack was small, influencing observed runoff slightly,\nand doing little to relieve the drought situation. Both conventional and SCA forecast procedures projected record low runoff\namounts and verified well.\n1978-Following the two extremely dry water years of 1976 and 1977,\nwater year 1978 brought well above normal streamflow to the southern Sierra Nevada. Heavy precipitation during the winter months\nproduced a snowpack by April 1 at the higher elevations that was\nover 175 percent of the average April 1 water content (as compared\nwith about 20 percent of the same date in 1977). However, many of\nthe winter storms were warm with relatively high freezing levels\nwhich resulted in snow lines much higher and snowcovered areas\nwere much smaller than might be anticipated with snowpack this\nheavy in the southern Sierra.\nApril was very cold with relatively heavy precipitation,\nfurther increasing the April-July snowmelt potential. May was dry\nwith only slightly below average temperatures. The short periods\nof high temperature which normally result in heavy snowmelt runoff\ntowards the end of May were absent, and snowmelt continued at relatively low rates through the month of May resulting in less\ndepletion of SCA than would normally occur. By mid-May, the\ngreatest SCA of record for that date was observed on both the\nKings and Kern River watersheds (as compared with data from satellite imagery and aircraft observations dating back to 1952).\nAlthough by mid-June, SCA on the Kings River was exceeded by that\nin 1967 (aircraft observations), the Kern River continued with the\nmaximum SCA of record for the remainder of the season. Plots of\ntime against SCA for the 1978 season appear in Figure 3(b) for the\nKings River and Figure 4(b) for the Kern River. Satellite imagery\nindicated there was still some substantial snowpack left in certain\nprotected high elevation portions of the watersheds well into\nAugust and some isolated snowfields persisted throughout the summer.\nBecause SCA on April 1 was well below that which might normally be anticipated with the relatively large snowpack water\ncontent at the higher elevations, water supply forecasts for the\nKings and Kern Rivers using SCA as a parameter were substantially\n\n198\n\nlower than those from other sources. By May 1, forecasts were\nraised as a result of heavy precipitation during April, but forecasts utilizing SCA were still substantially below the forecasts\nutilizing the conventional procedure. Subsequent updates gave\nsimilar results.\nForecasts utilizing SCA verified well, while conventional\nprocedures tended to overforecast. The record large SCA after\nMay 1 gave some assurance that flow which had not materialized\nprior to that date was still available in the form of snowpack\nwithin the watersheds. The forecasts utilizing SCA were conveyed\nto operating agencies in the southern Sierra as part of the NASA\nprogram. The major operational problem during the 1978 snowmelt\nseason, as discussed under SCA Data Interpretation, was in securing\nimagery at the time forecasts were required.\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe areal extent of snowcover as derived from satellite\nimagery does appear to have some potential for improving the timeliness and frequency of hydrologic forecasts in California\'s ASVT\ntest areas. The greatest potential for water supply forecasting\nis probably in improving forecast accuracy and in expanding forecast services during the period of snowmelt. Problems of transient\nsnow line and uncertainties in future weather are the main reasons\nthat SCA appears to offer little in water supply forecast accuracy\nimprovement during the period of snowpack accumulation.\nDuring snowmelt, both rate and volume of snowmelt runoff can\nbe related to receding SCA as well as other parameters. Based on\nthe period of analysis of approximately 25 years, including both\naircraft and satellite observations, SCA appears to offer considerable improvement in accuracy of forecast updates under certain\nconditions. The improvement in accuracy appears to be greatest\nfrom watersheds with a limited amount of representative data available from the watershed on a real-time basis during the period of\nmelt. Also, SCA may have some potential in making forecast procedures more responsive to conditions involving unusual distribution\nof snowpack throughout the watershed.\nUse of SCA, from an operational standpoint, can become\nrestricted when there is considerable cloud cover over the mountainous region for extended periods of time. At these times,\nneither the Landsat nor the daily NOAA imagery may be available.\nThe experience of the interpreter is extremely valuable in estimating SCA during partial cloud cover from observed SCA on portions\nof the observed basins and adjacent basins. This skill may be\ncritical to the operational use of SCA. Delivery of imagery from\nthe source to the interpreter also may pose a critical problem.\nOperational experience during the past two seasons suggests that\nmuch more rapid dissemination of observed satellite imagery will\n\n199\n\nbe required before completely effective use can be made of SCA in\nDWR forecast responsibilities.\nSCA as a forecast parameter does not obviate the need for\nother accurate data from conventional sources to define water\nsupply and anticipated runoff. SCA does, however, provide one\nmore piece of supplemental information needed to increase the\nreliability of forecast updates during the period of snowmelt runoff. DWR plans to continue the interpretation of satellite imagery\nassociated with water supply forecasting on California\'s snowmelt\nstreams.\n\nREFERENCES\nBarnes, J. C. and Bowley, C.
