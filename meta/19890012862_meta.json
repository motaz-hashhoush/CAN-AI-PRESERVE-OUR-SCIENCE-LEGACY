On this basis, three types of charnockite occurrences can be recognized: those involved in isoclinal folds that were later boudinaged and refolded, those affected by migmatization synkinematic with early isoclinal folding, and incipient charnockites formed in low-pressure zones of fold-hinges and boudin-necks (e.g., Kabbaldurga). It was concluded that at least two, if not three, stages of charnockite formation are required by these structural data.", "title": "Structural relations of charnockites of South India", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-05T23:48:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19890012862, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Naha, K."}, "organization": {"name": "Indian Inst. of Tech.", "location": "Kharagpur., United States"}}, "id": "3dec907b0f4c4ead926308154603b2ac"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-27T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19890012862, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19890012862, "id": "43c6b4ca711445058d0500a5885f1861", "publicationName": "Lunar and Planetary Inst., Workshop on the Deep Continental Crust of South India", "publicationDate": "1988-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 19890012824, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "Workshop on the Deep Continental Crust of South India", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PROCEEDINGS", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
