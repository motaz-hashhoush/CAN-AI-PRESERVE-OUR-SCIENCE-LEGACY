These energetic features can have a strong impact on the economies of the states surrounding the Gulf. Large fisheries, oil and gas production as well as pollution transport are relevant issues. These circulation features in the Gulf are invisible to conventional IR and visible satellite imagery during the Summer months due to cloud cover and uniform surface temperatures. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery of the Gulf does penetrate the cloud cover and shows a rich assembly of features there year-round. Below are preliminary results from GOM SAR imagery taken by SEASAT in 1978 and by the AIRSAR program in 1991.", "title": "SAR observations in the Gulf of Mexico", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T18:51:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19940012269, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Sheres, David"}, "organization": {"name": "University of Southern Mississippi", "location": "Bay Saint Louis, MS, United States"}}, "id": "4560889cbc5e48b2a895bd94e2013e35"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19940012269, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19940012269, "id": "fe3cc2fd79fd431c874588ddc2ef471f", "publicationName": "JPL, Summaries of the Third Annual JPL Airborne Geoscience Workshop.
