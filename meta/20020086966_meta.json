The 1 1/2 hour 'Update for Teachers' programs originate at Oklahoma State University (OSU) Telecommunications Center. The television signals are transmitted to the WESTAR IV communications satellite, which remits them to participating schools across the U.S. and in parts of Mexico and Canada. The schools are equipped with small home style satellite reception dishes. Education Satellite Videoconference programs are conducted four times yearly, covering a variety of aerospace subjects. Teachers can call toll-free and have questions answered after the speaker's presentations. Information about NASA educational resources and how to obtain them will be provided.", "title": "Satellite Videoconferences", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-20T23:30:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-09-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20020086966, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20020086966, "id": "c3e41b86b2574c2c8b7ef69084c03b15", "publicationName": "Spinoff 1990", "publicationDate": "1990-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20020086966.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20020086966/downloads/20020086966.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20020086966/downloads/20020086966.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20020086966/downloads/20020086966.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
