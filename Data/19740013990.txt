(In the new baseline Processing Sequence No.\n\n2 the\n\nhydrolysis is carried out on a water extract of the soil. )\nAcidic hydrolysis carried out directly on the soil sample precludes\nany loss of material and is gentle enough to minimize the destruction or\nracemization of the amino acids.\n\nThe soil can be removed by filtration\n\nand the excess acid (HC1) removed by evaporation.\n\nThe product of the\n\nsoil hydrolysis contains materials such as organic acids, neutral organic\ncompounds,\nanalysis.\n\nand salts which may interfere in the subsequent steps of the\n\nThe interfering materials are separated from the amino acids\n\nthrough precipitation with HF/NH4 0H and subsequent desalting in an ion\nexchange column.\n\n(Processing Sequence No. 2 produces significantly less\n\ninterfering material, and the precipitation step can be eliminated and\ndesalting is\n\naccomplished with an ion exchange column only. )\n\nThe amino acids in a solution at a suitably low pH are injected onto\na strong cation exchange resin column in the acid form.\nabsorbed as ammonium ions RNH3\n\n+\n\nThey are\n\nwhile any anions and neutral organic\n\nspecies are passed through.\n\nFollowing this, the amino acids are washed\n\noff the column with NH40OH.\n\nThe NH40OH can be removed by evaporating\n\nthe solution to dryness,\n\nleaving a residue of relatively pure amino acids.\n\nOnce the amino acid is extracted and purified,\n\nits enantiomers are\n\nresolved chemically by derivatization with an optically active esterification\nreagent, and after acylation the enantiomers separated by means of a gas\nchromatograph based on the differences in the properties of the resultant\ndiastereoisomers.\n\nGas chromatography has proven to be a sensitive and\n\nsimple method for separating the individual amino acid derivatives,\n2-1\n\nidentifying them by a characteristic retention time, and resolving the\ndiastereoisomers.\nThe objective of the wet chemistry instrument breadboard program\nhas been to obtain data on the performance of a prototype instrument system\ncomparable to that which would be obtained from an actual flight instrument.\nThe following tasks were carried out to accomplish this objective:\n"\n\nA breadboard based on the flight instrument concept presented\nin the Final Report for NASA Contract NAS 2-6218 was designed\nand fabricated.\n\n*\n\nLaboratory materials compatibility tests to support breadboard\ndesign were carried out.\n\n*\n\nStep-by-step evaluation of the performance of each breadboard\ncomponent for its function in the process sequence was conducted.\n\n*\n\nLaboratory tests in glassware for control analyses were carried\nout.\n\n*\n\nBreadboard performance demonstration tests with ratiotracers,\nNASA/ARC supplied soils, and amino acid-free soils were\naccomplished.\n\n*\n\nThe flight design concept based upon the breadboard program\nresults and the new baseline Processing Sequence No. 2 was\nrevised and updated.\n\nA major accomplishment of this study was the demonstration that the\nupdated flight instrument concept is basically able to meet the experimental objectives specified in NASA/ARC Specification A-16231,\nOctober 15,\n\n1973, under the conditions specified therein.\n\nRev. 3 from\n\nSeveral remain-\n\ning problems were identified, and solutions to those problems are proposed.\nThe design of the wet chemistry instrument system was revised to\nincorporate the change from three sets of processing cells in the previous\ninstrument concept to just one set of reusable cells, and also to meet the\nnew interface requirements which, with minor exceptions, are identical\nto the current VLBI interface.\n\nMajor instrument components such as the\n\nprocessing cells and the ion exchange column are flight-weight versions\nof the equivalent components used successfully in the breadboard.\n\nDesign\n\nconcepts and detailed designs proven on VLBI have been incorporated when\ndeemed appropriate.\n\nThe proposed use of gas actuated tantalum diaphragm\n\nvalves and the presentation of a conceptual design is an important step\n2-2\n\ntowards solving the valve problem on the wet chemistry instrument, which\nwas identified during this study.\n\n2-3\n\n3.\n\nBREADBOARD TEST PROGRAM\n\nOur basic approach to the breadboard test program has been to\nconduct a series of tests on the breadboard instrument to provide test\ndata comparable to that which would be obtained from a flight instrument.\nThe objective of these tests.has been to determine the performance of the\ninstrument - initially at the component level, with modifications made in\neach unit as required.\n\nAs the functionality of each cell was demonstrated,\n\nthe units were combined ultimately up to complete system level.\n\nIn both\n\ncomponent level and system level testing, experiments were run to\ndetermine the percent recovery of amino acids, the sensitivity for trace\namounts of amino acids, the presence or absence of material interfering\nwith gas chromatographic analysis and the absence of racemization.\n\nIt\n\nwas intended that the test results would demonstrate that the materials\nand methods used to carry out the processing, derivatization and\nanalysis steps in an automated spacecraft instrument would not significantly degrade the experimental results demonstrated with laboratory\nglassware and that the various requirements pertinent to a flight\ninstrument could be satisfied.\nFor these tests, Processing Sequence No.\n\n1 listed in the Appendix\n\nwas used, which consisted of 6N HCI hydrolysis on the soil in the\nhydrolyzer unit, filtration into the evaporator unit, evaporation,\nredissolution in water, HF/NH40OH (initially NaOH) desalting, filtration\ninto the ion exchange column, washing of the IEC, elution of the amino\nacids with an ammonia solution into the derivitizer unit, evaporation to\ndryness and derivatization with 2-butanol/HC1 and then by trifluoracetic\nanhydride in methylene chloride, evaporation of the derivatives into a\ngas chromatograph column and GC analysis. This processing scheme\nresults in the exposure of the processing cells to much more severe\nconditions than those of the new baseline process which is Processing\nSequence No. 2, listed in the Appendix.\nIn addition to breadboard testing, a variety of supporting tests\nwere conducted. Standards and methods were established for radiotracer\nwork to follow breadboard and procedural losses. A series of material\n\n3-1\n\ncompatibility tests were run on candidate container,\nmaterials.\n\nThe need and procedures for rigid reagent clean-up were\n\nestablished for low level amino acid work.\nnuclease,\n\nseal and valve\n\nwas run.\n\nA standard protein,\n\nribo-\n\nA long-term (8-month) storage test was conducted on\n\nracemic 2-butanol/HCl in a sealed glass ampoule.\n\nSoil tests were run\n\nin laboratory glassware on different soils provided by NASA/ARC.\nRacemic 2-butanol was used for derivatization of samples prior to\ngas chromatographic analysis for most of the testing for convenience,\nease in interpretation of the chromatograms,\n\nand reduction of costs.\n\nTests using derivatization with optically active 2-butanol were carried\nout which demonstrated that there were no observable racemization\neffects in the breadboard or lab processing.\n3. 1\n\nBREADBOARD DESIGN\nThe breadboard design was based on the original flight design con-\n\ncept reported in TRW Final Report No.\nfor Processing Sequence No.\nout directly on the soil.\n\n16660-6001-RO-00 and developed\n\n1 in which an acid hydrolysis was carried\n\nThe design duplicated,\n\nas closely as practicable,\n\nall aspects of the flight design which might affect instrument performance,\nsuch as internal cell geometry, interconnecting valves and plumbing,\nmaterials exposed to the analysis process,\nIn the breadboard,\n\nsequencing,\n\nand vent pressures.\n\none set of cells was used which had to be capable of\n\nundergoing in excess of 50 analyses.\n\nThe extensive use of the breadboard\n\nrequired certain modifications to the hardware to accommodate extended\noperational lifetime,\n\ncleaning,\n\nlated flight type components,\n\nservicing,\n\nand parts replacement.\n\nSimu-\n\nsuch as hand operated valve simulators were\n\nused in some places,\nlines,\n\nand commercial components such as some valves,\nand detectors were incorporated where they did not affect the\n\nprocess.\nA schematic of the breadboard is shown in Figure 3-1.\nshows a photograph of the breadboard,\n\nFigure 3-2\n\nwhich was mounted on an 18-by-30\n\ninch panel which was self-supporting and which could be used on a\nlaboratory bench counter top.\n\nThe set of processing cells (hydrolyzer,\n\n3-2\n\nFOLDOUT FRAME\n\nPFDOW FR\n._\n\n-\n\nH /HE SUPPLY\n2\n\nVENT\nH2 /HE SUPPLY\n\nR1\nLVI\n\nLV3\n\nLV5\n\nLV\n\nLVIO\n\nLV12\n\nLV14\n\nLV1 5\n\nLV 17\n\nHYDROLYZER\n\nNH 4 0OH\n\nBL\n\nNaOH\n\nHF\n\nSFILTER\n\nSLV 2\n\nLV4\n\nLV9\n\nLV 1\n1\n\nLV13\n\nTFA\n\nHL\n\nHCL\n\nH2 0\n\nMC\n\nLV16\n\n513\nSC1\nSC2\n\nVENT\n2\n\nLV\n6\n\nVENT\n\nH\n28S\n\nR2\n\nSC\n3\n\n1\n2A\n\nFILTER\n\nEVAPORATOR\n\n(C4\n\nS4\n\n(C5\n\nS\n\nION\nCOLUMN\n\nS3\nH7\n\nH6\nLIQUID\nSENSOH\n\nHE\n\n02\n\nLEGEND\nH\n\nHEATERS\n\nS SOLENOID VALVE OR VALVE SIMULATOR\nLV M.E.R.

The seal problem was\nrectified by the use of hand-operated all tantalum diaphragm valves with\nTeflon seats. Figure 3-10 shows the breadboard derivatizer with the all\ntantalum valves.\n3.1.6\n\nValves\n\nValves proposed for the original flight design (TRW Final Report\nNo. 16660-6001-RO-00) were modified VLBI solenoid valves with tantalum\nfront end for reagent compatibility. The valves used successfully on the\nbreadboard hydrolyzer, evaporator and ion exchange column were hand\noperated solenoid valve simulators. The valve design concept was based\non available compatibility data which indicated that Viton elastomer was\nsatisfactory for all reagents except ammonia. Viton was also a preferred\nselection because of its good high temperature characteristics.\n\nFig-\n\nure 3-11 is a cross sectional schematic of the valve assembly. The valve\nhousing was fabricated of 316 Stainless Steel. The center shaft (pintle)\nand valve body were machined from Tantalum. The poppet seal was\nTeflon and the elastomeric seals were Viton E-60C initially. The shaft\nseal was later replaced by an EPR O-ring and the static seal at the base\nof the valve was changed to a Creavey seal. Figure 3-12 shows several\nassembled hand-operated solenoid valve simulators.\nBecause of contamination problems on the derivatizer and after extensive\nvalve and system studies, a gas-actuated tantalum diaphragm valve was\nselected for the new flight design, and hand-operated, all tantalum prototype diaphragm valves with Teflon seats were constructed and used on the\nThe hand-operated prototype tantalum valve is\npictured in Figure 3-13 installed on a test fixture.

Because of the relatively\nhigh spring rate of the machined diaphragm a screw jack is utilized to\nactuate the valve to the open positions.

Test results with both cells were\ncomparable with laboratory glassware results, and a high\ndegree of confidence in the adequacy of the design and compatibility of the basic cell material (tantalum) has been\nestablished. Furthermore, there are indications that the\ndesign and materials will function even better with Process\nNo. 2.\n\n2)\n\nNH 4 0H was found to be superior to NaOH in neutralizing HF\nin the precipitation step because of the greater ease of attaining the desired pH with NH40H.\n\n3)\n\nTests with a 30-milliliters Biorad AG 50W-x8 (Dowex 50W)\n200-400 mesh ion exchange column (IEC) showed better perHowever, the\nformance than equivalent glassware columns.\nas a major soure of interion exchange resin was identified\nfering materials, leading to interference in the gas chromatographic analysis. The need for cleanup immediately prior\nto use via NaOH elution followed by HC1 regeneration was\nestablished. The use of a 5-milliliter ion exchange column\nwith with Process No. 2 should greatly decrease the amount\nof interfering material produced during ion exchange\ndesalting.\n\n4)\n\nThe complete absence of observable racemization effects\nanywhere in the breadboard was demonstrated.\n\n5)\n\nSome material incompatibilities were identified during testing of the derivatizer; e.g., elastomeric valve seals and the\nCreavey Seal used for the cell seal contributed to high background. These problems were rectified by using all tantalum\nvalves with Teflon seats and a tantalum/Teflon cell seal.\nSome interference problems remain however, which are\nassociated with heating the derivatizer to evaporate the\n3-25\n\nderivatives, obtained from samples derived from soils\nprocessed in the breadboard system, onto the GC column.\nAt least one solution does exist for this problem.\n6)\n\nSuccessful derivatizations of amino acid mixtures (25 nanomole levels) were performed after extensive cleaning and\nvacuum bakeout of the derivatizer, although some interference was still present in most tests.\n\n7)\n\nAdditional components that were identified as contributors of\ninterferring materials were the Teflon filters and possibly\nthe Teflon/Kel-F reagent containers.\n\n8)\n\nChanging from Process No. 1 to Process No. 2 should\nreduce or eliminate most of the remaining problems and\nwhile further work is needed, we have a high degree of\nconfidence that the remaining problems can be solved and\nthat a flight instrument can be produced which will successfully carry out the experiment within the mission constraints.\n\n3.2. 1 Component Tests\n3. 2. 1.1\n\nHydrolyzer\n\nThe hydrolyzer was tested with soil-free blanks, with\nradiotracer doped Waukena soil and with Ribonuclease on blank soil. All\nfunctions of the hydrolyzer were successfully carried out and the test\nSummary:\n\nresults were comparable to conventional glassware results. Good amino\nacid recovery (90 percent) and freedom from racemization or corrosion\neffects were demonstrated.\n\nThe only problems observed with the hydro-\n\nlyzer were concerned with the Teflon filters which gave high background\nblanks even after extensive clean up. The hydrolyzer was still in good\nworking order after more than 20 hydrolyses.\nDetailed Test Results:\n\nInitial testing of the hydrolyzer consisted of\n\nengineering proof, leak, and heater tests. The associated M. E. R. fittings\nwere checked as well. The M. E. R. fittings were hand-tightened only and\nAll were bubble tight and all combinations were\nM. E. R. fittings in M. E.

Next, engineering oriented Waukena soil tests were carried out\nwhich demonstrated overall functionality.\n\nThe cell seals performed\n\nadequately, with no visible loss of solution occurring during the hydrolysis.\n\nFluid handling techniques were satisfactory including injection of\n\nthe wash H20 up through the filter stack.\n\nInspection of the unit indicated\n\nno evidence of chemical attack after 45 hours of exposure to 6N HC1 at\n1050 to 110 0 C.\n\nThe hydrolysate from one of the above soil tests was\n\ncarried through the rest of the processing scheme in laboratory glassware.\nThe sample was analyzed by gas chromatography and compared to a sample\nprocessed completely in laboratory glassware.\n\nThe two chromatograms\n\nwere generally similar with the amino acid concentrations being somewhat\nlarger in the sample hydrolyzed in the hydrolyzer than in the sample hydroRadiotracers ( 1 4 C labeled amino acids) had also been\n\nlyzed in glassware.\n\nadded to the soil prior to hydrolysis.\n\nThe net recovery of the radio-\n\ntracers in the hydrolysate and the wash was 90 percent.\nAfter thorough cleaning, contamination blank was carried out by\ninjecting 7. 5 milliliters of 6N HC1 into the hydrolyzer and heating for\nseveral hours at 1000C.\n\nThe solution was collected and a 2. 5 milliliter\n\nportion was evaporated to dryness and derivatized.\n\nThe derivatization\n\nblank for the batch of 2-butanol/HC1 in use had become excessively large\nand precluded observation of trace contaminants below the one nanomole\nrange.\n\nThe chromatogram for the hydrolyzer contamination blank did not\n\nshow any observable amino acid peaks and only three non-interfering\nunidentified contaminant peaks.\nThe hydrolyzer was then rinsed with redistilled water and loaded\nwith 1 cubic centimeter of the ARC blank soil. One milliliter of aqueous\n-5\nribonuclease (2 x 10-5 M) was added to the soil to probovine pancreatic\nvide 20 nanomoles of the standard enzyme.\n\nThe cell was then closed and\n\n6. 5 milliliters of 6. 9N HC1 was injected to provide a net HC1 concentration of 6N for the 7. 5 milliliters of solution.\nsurizing with He/H\n\n2\n\nAir was removed by pres-\n\nand then venting several times.\n\nThe hydrolyzer was\n\nheated to 110 0 C and held at this temperature for 16 hours,\n\nafter which the\n\nhydrolysate was forced out and collected along with the 5 milliliter H20\nrinse for further processing in laboratory glassware.\n\n3-27\n\nRadiotracers consisting of 14C labeled alanine (2 nanomoles),\n\nvaline\n\n(12 nanomoles) and leucine (4. 5 nanomoles) were added to the hydrolysate\nbefore continuing the processing in laboratory glassware in order to monitor losses in the subsequent steps.\nWhile the hydrolysis was being carried out, a set of controls was\nhydrolyzed in laboratory glassware.\n\nThese controls were: (1) 1 cubic\n\ncentimeter of blank soil, 20 nanomoles of ribonuclease,\nwithout ribonuclease,\nAfter hydrolysis,\n\n(2) blank soil\n\nand (3) 20 nanomoles of ribonuclease without soil.\n\nthe ribonuclease sample without soil was evaporated to\n\ndryness and derivatized without further processing.\n\nThe other two\n\nlaboratory samples were filtered as usual and then the same radiotracers\nas above were added to the combined filtrates and rinsings for the two\nlaboratory hydrolysates.\n\nThe three solutions were then evaporated and\n\ncarried through the subsequent HF-NaOH and ion exchange processing\nsteps.\n\nRadiotracer results are given in Table 3-1.\n\nThe recoveries are\n\ngood up to the derivatization step, but significant losses occurred during\nGas chromatograms are shown in Figure 3-19.\nthe derivatization process.\nComparison of the chromatograms indicates that the hydrolysis in\nthe hydrolyzer was equivalent to the hydrolyses in laboratory glassware.\nAfter the hydrolysis was completed, the hydrolyzer was disassembled\nfor cleaning and inspection.\nout.\n\nThe Teflon filters had inadvertently been left\n\nHowever, very little soil escaped the hydrolyzer because of the small\n\norifice size in the valve and because of the tendency of the soil to act as a\nfilter.\n\nIt is doubtful that the absence of the filters had any deleterious\n\neffects on the experiment.\n\nInspection of the hydrolyzer showed no changes\n\nin appearance.\nFurther testing with the hydrolyzer indicated that a small leak had\ndeveloped in the outlet valve (S-l).\n\nThis leak may have been a result of\n\na small amount of soil passing through the valve.\nproblem.\n\nValve rework cured the\n\nThe S-1 valve is different from the other valves in that it has a\n\nlarger poppet and hence has less sealing pressure.\n\nIt is recommended\n\nthat if this unit is to be used in the future that the unit be reworked to\naccept valve simulators with the smaller poppet.\n\n3-28\n\nTable 3-1.\n\nRadiotracer Recoveries for Hydrolyzer Test with Ribonuclease ARC Blank Soil Labeled\nAfter Hydrolysis with Alanine, Valine, Leucine, Total cpm 1, 036, 000\nLab Processed\nSoil + RNase\n\nBreadboard Processed\nSoil + RNase (20 nmole)\n\n% original cts.\n\ncpm*\n\nLab Processed\nSoil, No RNase\ncpm*:\n\n% original cts.\n\ncpm*\nCombined filtrates\nafter HF/NaOH step\n\n% original cts.\n\n1,001,000\n\n96.6\n\n988,000\n\n95.4\n\n967,000\n\n5,790\n\n0.6\n\n5,360\n\n0. 5\n\n21, 160\n\n1, 052,000\n\n101. 5\n\n1,021, 000\n\n98.6\n\n951,000\n\n91.8\n\n1,670\n\n0.2\n\n1,250\n\n0.1\n\n1,240\n\n0.1\n\n601,000\n\n58. 0\n\n515,000\n\n49. 7\n\n514,000\n\n49.6\n\n93.3\n\nIon Exchange\n\nPrecut\nPrime filtrate\nPost cut\nDerivative**\n\n*cpm corrected for background and for volume sampled\n*-After evaporation of TFA/CH 2C\n\n2\n\nand dissolution in CH\n\n2\n\nC1 2\n\n2.0\n\nHYDROLYZER TEST\n1 CC "BLANK" SOIL PLUS 20 NANAMOLES RIBONUCLEASE HYDROLYZED\nIN HYDROLYZER WITH REMAINING PROCESSING CARRIED OUT IN\nLAB GLASSWARE.

Also, the\nenvironment is less corrosive. Otherwise, the same basic functions are\nrequired of the processing cell.\nNo.\n\nThus, the hydrolyzer used for Process\n\n1 is expected to work very well as the extractor for Process No.\n\n2.\n\n3.2. 1.2 Evaporator\nThe evaporator was tested with soil-free blanks, with\nradiotracer doped standard soil hydrolysate, and with hydrolysates from\nsoils hydrolysed in the hydrolyzer. After some small modifications in\nSummary:\n\nthe unit after initial engineering tests, all functions of the evaporator were\nsuccessfully carried out, and the test results were comparable to results\nobtained in parallel tests with conventional glassware.\n\nMuch greater ease\n\nin attaining the desired pH was obtained by substituting NH 4 0H for NaOH\nin the desalting step. Good amino acid recovery (94 to 100 percent) using\neither NaOH or NH40H in the processing and freedom from racemization\neffects were demonstrated. The only continuing problems concerned with\nthe evaporator were with the filter stack which required a higher pressure\ndrop than desired to achieve adequate flow, and which gave high background blanks from the Teflonfilter materialeven after extensive clean-up.\nDespite the large number of tests with HC1, HF, and NH40OH, no significant corrosion effects were found at the end of the test program after\nmore than 20 HF-NH40H (or NaOH) processes and more than 25 HC1\nevaporations.\nDetailed Test Results:\n\nInitial testing of the evaporator consisted of\n\nengineering proof, leak and heater tests.\n\nTwo engineering oriented pro-\n\ncessing tests were carried out on the unit using Waukena soil hydrolysate\n(processed in the hydrolyzer) doped with 14C labeled alanine, valine, and\nleucine. Several problems were encountered in these tests both from procedural errors and from deficiencies in the unit itself.\n\n3-31\n\nBecause of the\n\nunavailability of tantalum capillary tubing, a heated stainless steel\ncapillary tube was used for the vent restrictor in these tests.\n\nThis\n\nrestrictor plugged during HC1 evaporation, and therefore was removed.\nIn the absence of the restrictor, difficulties occurred during evaporation\nand reagent mixing which resulted in losses into the vent system.\nconfirmed that a restrictor was required.\n\nThis\n\nDuring the injection of the HF\n\nand the NaOH solutions, portions of the reagents went into the vent instead\nof the cell, apparently because of a flow surge as the last of the reagent\nentered the cell head end.\n\nThe problem was more pronounced with the\n\nNaOH solution probably because of inadequate volume in the cell.\n\nAnother\n\ndeficiency noted was that a portion of the solution escaped the HF/NaOH\nprocessing by being trapped in a small volume between the bottom of the\nfilter stack and the outlet valve.\nOnly one of the two tests was carried to completion.\n\nIn this test,\nthe pH of the solution pushed out of the bottom of the evaporator after\nHF/NaOH processing was 5.\n\nAn additional 0. 5 milliliter of NaOH solution\n\nwas required to reach the desired pH of 9.\n\nAfter pH adjustment, the solu-\n\ntion was reintroduced into the cell and pushed out through the filter again.\nThe remainder of the processing and derivatization was completed in\nglassware.\n\nRadiotracer measurements after ion exchange desalting\n\nshowed 73 percent recovery for the breadboard hardware processing as\ncompared to 92 percent recovery for a sample processed entirely in\nglassware.\n\nThis was not surprising in view of the various difficulties\n\nencountered.\nIn contrast to the radiotracer results, gas chromatographic analysis\nof the resulting derivatives indicated larger yields for most of the amino\nacids in the breadboard hardware sample.\n\nThis indicated that the cleaning\n\nprocedures used prior to this test were inadequate.\nBased on the results of these tests, several modifications were made.\na tantalum disk with 0.010-inch sharp-edged orifice was fabricated for use\nas the vent restrictor.\n\nThis disk was inserted in the bottom of the M. E. R.\n\nfitting receptacle in the evaporator head end.\n\nThe restrictor was retained\n\nby the standard M. E. R. tube fitting which was inserted into the receptacle.\nSince the restrictor was located within the cell head end, it did not require\n\n3-32\n\nAn additional 24 milliliters of volume was provided\n\na separate heater.\n\nby adding a cylindrical tantalum section between the cell body and the head\nFinally, a tantalum\nend plate and extending the length of the standpipe.\nspacer was fabricated and installed downstream of the filter stack to\nreduce the volume between the filter and the outlet valve.\nAfter the modifications were completed, the evaporator and associated reagent injectors, valve blocks and interconnecting tubing were\ncleaned by repeated soaking and flushing with 6N HC1.\nduring some of the soak periods.\nwith redistilled water.\n\nHeat was applied\n\nThis was followed by repeated rinses\n\nThen a contamination blank was carried out by\n\ninjecting 7. 5 milliliters of 6N HC1 into the evaporator.\n\nThe HC1 solution\n\nwas heated several hours at 100 0 C and then pushed out of the cell through\nThe solution was evaporated to dryness and the residue\n\nthe filter stack.\nderivatized.\n\nGas chromatographic analysis showed a number of the com-\n\nmon amino acids,\n\ntypically at about the 20 nanomole level.\n\nIn comparison,\n\na similar contamination blank run on the hydrolyzer but without Teflon\nfilters present did not show similar quantities of contaminants.\nfore,\n\nThere-\n\nit was concluded that the Teflon filters were the source of the con-\n\ntamination.\n\nLater tests confirmed this conclusion and demonstrated that\n\nthese filters continually released contaminants when heated in the presence of HC1 and were extremely difficult to clean to an adequate level.\nAfter the above test, the evaporator was washed with water and a\nprocessing blank was carried out to test procedures and to obtain further\nblank information.\n\n7. 5 milliliters of 6N HC1 and 5 milliliters of H20 were\n\ninjected into the evaporator and a nominal evaporation was carried out\nwith vacuum applied to the evaporator vent.\n\nSeveral different tempera-\n\ntures were used during the course of the evaporation; the final temperature\nwas 100\n\n0\n\nC.\n\nNo evidence for bumping was observed during the evaporation\n\nprocess which required approximately 2 hours.\n\nAfter standing overnight,\n\n10 milliliters H20 was injected and the evaporator heated to 60 C.\n\nMixing\n\nby gas bubbling was carried out by alternately evacuating the cell and then\ninjecting He/H\n\n2\n\ngas through the center tube.\n\nNo loss of liquid into the\n\nvent was observed as a part of the gas bubbling.\n\nAfter cooling, 9 milli-\n\nliters of 5N HF was injected and the 5-minute mixing period was carried\nout by performing bubbling cycles twice each minute.\n\n3-33\n\nNext, an equivalent\n\namount of 5N NaOH was injected.\nthe end of this injection.\ning cycles for 15 minutes.\npressure,\n\nSome liquid went into the vent line at\n\nThe solution was mixed as before by gas bubblThe solution was then pushed out with gas\nAn additional 0. 25 milliliters\n\nand the pH checked and adjusted.\n\nof 5N NaOH was required to reach pH 8. 5,\nsolution was lost or consumed.\nadjustment.\n\nindicating that this quantity of\n\nA yellowish precipitate formed during pH\n\nThe 10 cubic centimeters wash was injected into the evaporaIts pH was neutral, and it was slightly cloudy.\n\ntor and collected.\n\nstanding, a small amount of white precipitate settled out.\n\nUpon\n\nThe filtrate and\n\nthe 10 milliliter wash were placed on an ion exchange column by decanting\nthe solutions away from the precipitates.\nDerivatization and gas chromatography were completed in laboratory glassware.\n\nAmino acids were present, mostly in the 2-nanomole\n\nalthough approximately 12 nanomoles each of glycine,\n\nrange,\n\nacid and glutamic acid were present.\n\naspartic\n\nThis was significantly better than\n\nthe previous contamination blank, but still greater than ion exchange\nblanks,\n\nindicating continued release of contaminants by the Teflon filters.\n\nThe evaporator was disassembled and inspected.\nany visible changes.\n\nIt did not show\n\nThe unit was reassembled with an additional seal\n\nin the filter holder to insure that some of the solution was not bypassing\nthe filter (a possible cause for the precipitate found in the wash solution).\nThe evaporator was washed with a series of 6N HCl flushes.\nof these,\ninjectors.\n\nDuring some\n\n"dummy" injections were carried out with the HF and NaOH\nIt was observed that in some, but not all instances,\n\nsome\n\nliquid blew into the vent line as the last portion of the solution rushed into\nthe cell.\n\nBetter results were obtained by injecting with the residual head-\n\nspace pressure rather than by applying constant pressure to the injector,\nbut it was not possible to entirely prevent liquid from going into the vent.\nAfter rinsing the evaporator and the HF and NaOH injectors repeatedly\nuntil the washings were neutral, another mixing test was carried out with\n9 milliliters of 5N HCI and an equivalent amount of 5N NaOH.\n\nThe stand-\n\nard procedure was carried out including injection of 10 milliliters H20\nexcept that some of the times were shortened.\nvent in both the HC1 and the NaOH injections.\n\n3-34\n\nSome liquid went into the\nAfter mixing for a while\n\nby gas bubbling the solution was pushed out through the filter and titrated.\nAgain, additional NaOH was required, approximately 0. 5 milliliter this\ntime.\nPossible causes of the NaOH discrepancy include loss into the vent\nduring injection and losses from the more viscous NaOH solution clinging\nLoss into the vent was probably not the cause.\nVisual estimates of the quantity of liquid which went into the vent indicated\nthat less than 0. 1 milliliter was lost in this manner. Since the NaOH\n\nto the injector walls.\n\nfollows the HF into the cell, there is some degree of extra washing of HF\ninto the cell that does not occur for the NaOH, but it is doubtful that this\ncould account for the 0. 25 to 0. 5 milliliter difference observed. It was\ndecided to add an extra 0. 4 milliliter of NaOH to make up for the amount\nlost.\nNext, a soil hydrolysate processing test was carried out using the\nstandard Waukena hydrolysate to which 14C labeled alanine, valine and\nleucine had been added.\n\nThe evaporation of the hydrolysate proceeded\n\nsmoothly without apparent bumping. After the evaporation was complete,\nthe traps in the ancillary vacuum system were washed out and the solution\ncounted.\n\nThe total radioactivity found in the traps was 0. 2 percent of that\n\nadded to the hydrolysate, indicating negligible loss during evaporation.\nProcessing was continued using the nominal procedure. Because of previous tests which indicated a NaOH discrepancy of approximately\n0. 4 milliter, the amount of NaOH solution loaded into the injector was\nincreased by 0. 4 milliliter over the amount nominally required. The\nHF-NaOH processing was carried out without difficulty (small amounts of\nHF and NaOH went into the vent during injection as had occurred in previous\ntests).\nThe filtration step after processing was unusually slow with the flow\nrate being only 0. 5 ml/min at 25 psi differential. However, after injecting the wash water and mixing, the wash solution flowed through the filters\nvery rapidly which indicated that a partial filtration blockage occurred\nduring filtration of the processed solution. The uppermost filter in the\nfilter stack was a 50-micron Teflon filter bonded to a perforated Teflon\nplate. The filter and plate were intended as a pre-filter and support for\nthe finer filters.\n\nFor this experiment, the filter had been loaded with the\n3-35\n\nperforated plate upwards.\n\nThis greatly reduced the effective surface area\n\nof the 50-micron filter and also made the system prone to blockage by the\nprecipitate filling up the holes in the Teflon plate. It was initially concluded that the reversal of the filter so that the 50-micron filter was up\nand the perforated plate was down would still provide adequate support\nfor the finer filters and would be much less likely to be blocked by the\nprecipitate.\n\n(Later results indicated filter clogging would occur regard-\n\nless of the filter type.)\nFollowing collection of the primary filtrate and the 10-cubic centimeter wash, the pH of the filtrate was found to be 9. This confirmed the\nneed for the additional 0. 4 milliliter of NaOH to achieve the desired pH.\nThe solutions were then placed on a laboratory ion exchange column and\nthe processing was completed in laboratory glassware.

Radiotracer results comparing recoveries of the breadboard processed sample with the lab processed\nsample are given in Table 3-2.\n\nNo significant losses occurred during the\n\nbreadboard portion of the processing.\n\nRecovery through the ion exchange\n\nstep was good for both samples.\nGas chromatography of the derivatives from the lab and the evaporator processed soil samples showed most of the relative areas to be\nequivalent. An interfering peak (trifluoroacetamide) at the leucine position prevented reproducibility for this amino acid.\nAt the end of this experiment, the evaporator was inspected and\ncleaned.\n\nThere were no visible signs of attack or degradation.\n\nAfter discussion of these results, NASA/ARC suggested the use of\nNH40H for HF neutralization and pH adjustment.\n\nFollowing laboratory\n\nverification (Section 3.3. 1) a breadboard processing test was carried out\nwith the HF-NH40H process. The sample was again standard Waukena\nsoil hydrolysate with added radiotracers.\n\nThe processing proceeded\n\nnominally except that filtration problems occurred again.\n\nThis time, the\n\nprecipitate was not stopped by the filter stack in the breadboard evaporator.\n\n3-36\n\nTable 3-Z.

The\nevaporator processing was carried out by the nominal procedure using\na portion of the standard Waukena soil hydrolysate. NH40H was used\nto neutralize the HF.\n\nThe filtration after the HF-NH 4 OH was carried\n\nout successfully although the flow rate through the filter stack was slow\ndue to the large number of filters in the filter stack.\n\nThe evaporator\n\nwash and filtration step was also carried out successfully.\n\nTherefore,\n\nit was concluded that an O-ring would provide adequate filter stack\nsealing.\nFurther testing of the evaporator was carried out as a part of the\nsystems level tests.\nThe basic conclusion from the component level evaporator testing\nwas that except for a higher pressure drop during filtration and release\nof contaminants by the Teflon filters, the unit functioned well and gave\nexcellent results.\nMost of these problems are effectively eliminated with the new\nbaseline process because there is no precipitation step and hence no\nprecipitate to clog.\nneeded,\n\nA filter may not be needed at all, and if one is\n\nit should be possible to change filter materials or to change the\n\ndesign so that interference material from Teflon filters will not be a\nproblem.\n\nFurther comparison of Process No.\n\nindicates that the conditions in Process No.\nProcess No.\n\n1 and Process No.\n\n2\n\n2 are milder than in\n\n1, and that all of the functions required for Process No.\n\n2\n\nhave already been demonstrated for the evaporator (which becomes the\nhydrolyzer/evaporator in Process No.\n3.2. 1. 3\n\n2).\n\nIon Exchange Column\n\nSummary:\n\nThe breadboard ion exchange column (IEC) was tested\n\nwith NH40H blank elutions, with HF-NH40H processing blanks, and\nwith soil samples processed through the HF-NH40H step in either\nlaboratory glassware or in the breadboard.\nIEC worked well.\n\nIn general, the prototype\n\nGood recovery (90 to 96 percent) of amino acids was\n\ndemonstrated with samples containing 14C labeled amino acids.\n3-39\n\nFlow\n\nrate variations did occur because of resin volume changes with different\nbut proper flow control could be achieved via an external flow\nThe teflon coated stainless steel spring performed satisrestrictor.\nreagents,\n\nfactorily in maintaining bed packing with upward flow through the column.\nThe only significant problem with the IEC was that the resin itself was a\nsource of interfering material.\n\nThe interference from the resin was\n\nreduced by elution and regeneration of the IEC immediately before use.\nThe breadboard IEC contained 30 milliliters of resin which is the amount\nrequired for Process No.\n5 milliliters of resin.\n\n1.\n\nThus,\n\nThe new baseline process requires only\nthe flight IEC would be expected to produce\n\nsignificantly less interference.\nDetailed Test Results:\n\nAfter proof and leak checks, the breadboard\n\nion exchange column was loaded with ion exchange resin from one of the\nlaboratory columns then in use. At the time of loading, the resin was\nin the H+ form and was loaded in a 4N HC1 slurry since the resin\noccupies minimum volume in the HC1 solution.\n\nSufficient resin was\n\nadded to just slightly compress the Teflon-covered spring after the 30- to\n60-micron Teflon sliding filter (bed support) was installed.\n\nBefore\n\ninstalling the inlet valve block, the volume of the bed was observed as\nAs the resin went\n\nwater was washed through it via suction on the outlet.\n\nfrom the acid to the neutral environment, the filter was pushed down the\ntube as the resin expanded.\n\nAfter the column effluent was neutral and\n\nhad expanded to its greatest extent, the spring compression was checked.\n(It was found that the spring was not fully compressed and, therefore,\nthere was adequate spring travel.)\n\nThe rest of the assembly was com-\n\npleted, and the column was mounted on the breadboard.\n\nThe first test\n\ncarried out was to monitor the column flow rate as the column was\neluted with NH 4 OH, washed with water,\n\nand regenerated with HC1.\n\nInitially, 40 psi was required to obtain significant flow, but after a short\nperiod of time, the flow increased.\n\nSome irregularities in flow also\n\noccurred when flow was stopped and then restarted.\n\nThese effects were\n\napparently a result of air trapped in the 0. 1-inch-thick Teflon filters\nused as bed supports.\n\nAfter several cycles of HC1, H 2 0,\n\nNH40OH, H 2 0,\n\nall of the trapped air escaped and the flow behavior was reproducible.\nThe flow did vary depending on the reagent in the column because of bed\nexpansion and contraction.\n3-40\n\nTo better define the flow variations, an HF/NH4 OH blank was run\nthrough the IEC while monitoring pressure and flow rate as the various\nreagents passed through the column.\n\nThe pressures required to main-\n\ntain a flow rate of 0. 5 ml/min varied from 6. 5 to 3. 5 psi from the initial\nNH4F solution through the ammonia elution. This is not an excessive\npressure variation, and the flow could be controlled reasonably well with\nthe addition of an external flow restrictor.\n\nFor a time, a 1. 5-micron\n\nTeflon filter held in a M. E. R. union was used as a restrictor; but for\nmost testing, a restrictor was not used and the pressure applied was\nadjusted to maintain the proper flow rate.\nThe collected filtrate from an evaporator test was labeled with\n14C proline, glutamic acid, phenylalanine and lysine. After adding\nphenolphthalein, the filtrate was placed in the breadboard ammonia\nreservoir and was pushed onto the ion exchange column.\n\nThis was\n\nfollowed by the evaporator wash, 30 milliliters of H O and 4N NH4 OH.\nDuring the NH4OH elution the pressure was adjusted to maintain the\nflow at 0.5 ml/min.\n\nThe pressure required varied from 3.8 to 6.6 psi.\n\nResults of the radiotracer measurements are shown in Table 3-3.\nThe overall results were quite good, with all the radioactivity being\naccounted for within experimental error.\n\nThe volume in the column exit\n\ntube was small (<100 [1I) so that prime eluent (7 ml) included virtually\nno solution prior to the appearance of the phenolphthalein color.\n\nThis\n\naccounts for the fact that the precut contained 3. 5 percent of the radioactivity, since a small quantity of the amino acids usually immediately\nprecedes the appearance of the indicator color.\n\nTherefore, a short\n\nlength of 1/8-inch OD teflon tubing was added to the outlet tube to\nincrease the volume in the line and hence to retain more solution preceding the appearance of the phenolphthalein color.\nSome losses occurred during subsequent laboratory processing of\nthe prime eluent (evaporation and derivatization).\n\nThe evaporation loss\n\nrepresents bumping problems on the rotary evaporator.\n\nRadiotracer\n\nmeasurements made during laboratory derivatization are also shown in\nTable 3-3.\n\n3-41\n\nTable 3-3.\n\nBreadboard Ion Exchange Column Radiotracer\nRecovery, Initial Activity -

At this point, most of the derivatizations with pure\namino acids and optically inactive\nference peak.\n\n2-butanol showed one remaining inter-\n\nHowever, the final derivatization which was with optically\n\nactive 2-Butanol, in addition to showing that no racemization effects\noccurred, also did not produce any significant interference peaks. Derivatization of samples derived from soil processing continued to produce\nlarge interference and further work is needed in this area. However, it\nis felt that a solution to this problem is available. The change from\nProcessing Sequence No.\n\n1 to the new baseline process should also result\n\nin reduced interference.\nDetailed Test Results.\n\nPreliminary proof and leak tests indicated\n\nthat some modifications were needed in the vent line and vent restrictor.\nThe initial restrictor was a Teflon orifice in a Teflon Swagelok fitting,\nand it tended to leak with thermal cycling. The Teflon orifice was\nreplaced with a tantalum orifice press fitted into the end of the tantalum\n\n3-48\n\nvent tube coming out of the derivatizer head end. In order to have more\nreliable temperature control, the meter relay type temperature controllers were replaced with a better type of thermocouple controller which\nincorporated thermocouple break protection. Heater tests were carried\nout which demonstrated that the proper temperatures could be obtained.\nCooling tests were carried out to develop a convenient method of cooling\nthe derivatizer to 0 0 C or below. An insulated box was constructed to\nsurround most of the derivatizer: by placing crushed dry ice into the\nbox, but not in direct contact with the unit, it was possible to reduce the\n0\nderivatizer temperature below -5 C. The unit could be controlled at\nthis temperature with the temperature controllers. The magnitude of\nthe thermal gradients was not determined.\nEvaporation tests carried out with a 4N NH40H solution containing\nphenolphthalein proceeded smoothly with no apparent bumping. There\nwas no evidence of phenolphthalein color in the condensate found in the\nThus, it appeared that the NH 4 OH and butanol/HC1\nreagents could be successfully evaporated. Later tests also confirmed\nthis although bumping did occur in a few instances when the vent valve\nvacuum system trap.\n\nwas opened when the solution in the cell was at too high a temperature\n(>700C for H 2 0).\nTests were then set up to monitor TFA/CH 2 CL 2 evaporation. The\nevaporation of NH40H and butanol/HC1 can be monitored by the presence\nof condensate in the unheated portions of the vacuum system. This condensation does not occur with CH2C12 and hence some tests were carried\nout with a pressure transducer added to the derivatizer so that evaporation times could be determined as a function of reagent quantity and of\nThese evaporation tests were carried out separately\nsince it was undesirable for the transducer to be present during an actual\nderivatization because of materials problems. These tests were based\ncell temperature.\n\non the fact that, as long as there is reagent in the cell, the pressure\nwas significantly above zero because of the flow restrictor in the vent\nThe times required for evaporation of TFA and methylene chloride,\n0\nindividually, and as a mixture from the derivatizer at -5 C, were deterline.\n\nmined with the transducer connected to the S-8 outlet line.

Next, 0. 4 milliliter total quantities of\n\nCHZC1 2 , TFA, or a mixture of the two, were introduced through valve\nS-9 via a syringe attached to the inlet line.

It was concluded from these tests that 10 to 12 minutes was a sufficient length of\ntime for the reagents to evaporate at -50C.\n\n(In later tests, the evapora-\n\ntion time for TFA/CH2C12 was increased to 30 minutes to insure complete\nevaporation of any last traces of TFA.)\nTests were carried out to demonstrate that methylene chloride\ncould be evaporated off without significant losses of amino acid derivatives, and that the derivatives could be evaporated out of the derivatizer\nand into a GC column.\n\nFour microliters of a standard amino acid deriv-\n\native solution (= 2 nanomoles each) were injected with a syringe through\na chilled inlet line into the evacuated, chilled cell followed by a total of\nThe cell was opened to vacuum for 10 minutes\nat -5 0 C in order to evaporate the CH 2 C12.

The cell and S-8\n0\noutlet were slowly heated to and then held at 150 C for about 5 minutes.\nThe column was then removed from the breadboard and reconnected to\nthe gas chromatograph for data collection.\nTwo such tests were performed initially.\n\nThe first chromatogram\n\nshowed a broad interference peak during the elution of valine through proline which was not present in the second run. This interference may have\nbeen from residual matter in the cell since only limited heating of the cell\nhad been carried out prior to this test. The chromatogram from the second test was, in general, good although the glutamic acid peaks were\neither missing or smeared out.\n\n(Later tests with standard derivatives\n\ncarried out to monitor the derivatization condition generally were free\nof interferences and all expected peaks were present and well shaped.)\n3-50\n\n4\nz\'\n\nEVAPORATION OF METHYLENE CHLORIDE AND\nTRIFLUOROACETIC ANHYDRIDE FROM BREADBOARD DERIVATIZER AT -5 *C.\n\n\'\n\n.\n1.\n\n)\ne\n\n0 VOLTS 0 0 PRESSURE\nZERO PRESSURE POINT VARIABLE\n\n0.5-\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\nTIME (MINUTES)\n\nFigure 3-22.\n\nEvaporation of Methylene Chloride and Trifluoroacetic Anhydride\nfrom Breadboard Derivatizer at -5 0 C.\n\n12\n\nSince the derivatizer appeared to be capable of performing the basic\nprocesses required, two complete derivatizations were carried out on\nthree amino acids in the derivatizer followed by evaporation of the products into a laboratory GC column and subsequent gas chromatographic\nanalysis.\n\nThe complete process included injection of 1 milliliter of an\n\naqueous solution of 2 nanomoles each of valine and phenylalanine and 10\nnanomoles of proline followed by injection of 6 milliliters of 4 N NH40H\nto provide the proper solution conditions.\n\nThe 7 milliliters of aqueous\n\nNH 4 0H solution were evaporated in the nominal mode by heating the vent\n(H3C) to 1200C, opening S-6 and then slowly heating the cell (H3A, H3B)\nto 100 0 C. (H3A, H3B, H3C are heater designations in Figure 3-1.) The\nevaporation required 40 to 60 minutes for completion as evidenced by no\nvisible vapor in the vacuum vent lines.\n\nThe heaters were turned off, and\n\nwhen the cell had cooled to about 500C, 2 milliliters of 2-butanol/HC1\nwere injected. Next, the lower cell was gradually heated to 100 0 C with\nthe cell closed.\n\nThe upper cell temperature was set (H3A) about 50C less\n\nthan that of the lower cell to encourage refluxing.\n\nThree hours later, the\n\nheaters were turned down and the cell allowed to cool to below 700C before\nbeing opened to the vacuum for the evaporation step.\n\nThe evaporation of\n\nthe 2-butanol/HC1 required from 15 to 35 minutes before appearing\ncomplete.\nDuring this process, the cell was heated at 700C and the vent line\nwas heated to 110 0 C.\n\nAfter the evaporation was completed and the deriv-\n\natizer had cooled to room temperature, 0.2 milliliter CH2C12 and 0.2\nmilliliter TFA were injected into the cell, and the acylation step was\nallowed to proceed for 1 hour.\n\nThe cell was then cooled (lower cell temp-\n\n0\n\nerature, H3B = -5 C) and opened to the vacuum for 10 to 12 minutes in\norder to allow the TFA/CH 2 C12 to evaporate.\n\nThe derivatives were trans-\n\nferred to a GC column by slowly heating the derivatizer to 1500C with\n15 cc/min He/HZ flow through the derivatizer into the column. Finally,\nthe column was transferred to the Varian 1800 GC and a standard GC\nprogram carried out.\n\nThe resulting chromatogram showed an extremely\n\nlarge amount of interference (approximately one thousand times the size\nof a 2-nanomole amino acid derivative peak) throughout the chromatogram.\nAt the conclusion of this test, the derivatizer was disassembled for inspection and cleaning.\n\nThe inside of the cell was covered with a grey dusty\n3-52\n\nresidue which was easily wiped out. In addition, the cell walls were\nsomewhat streaked and spotted. These spots remained even after extensive soakings and washings with various reagents, and may have been\npresent before the derivatization was carried out.\nAfter the derivatizer was cleaned, dried, and reassembled, it was\nbaked out under vacuum for 30 minutes at 1500C to insure that any volatile impurities were removed. The derivatization was then repeated, but\nthe chromatographic results were similar to the first derivatization.\nAlthough the interfering material was an order of magnitude lower than\nthe first test, it was still 4 orders of magnitude larger than can be\naccepted.\nAfter running the chromatogram at the conclusion of the first derivatization test, it was found that the column (Carbowax 20 M) no longer\nfunctioned properly.\n\nAt the time no special note was taken of this fact\n\nsince this particular column was near the end of its life, having been\nused for a considerable period of time. However, after the second derivatization test, the column used (Dexsil 400) was again damaged. Therefore, it was concluded that the material coming out of the derivatizer\neither by partially remaining in the column or by reacting with the liquid\nphase had altered the column. Since previous results have demonstrated\nthat TFA can be passed through the column, it was concluded that the\ninterfering material had been formed during the derivatization from something in the derivatizer and the peaks seen were not a result of unevaporated TFA.\nThe primary suspects as a source of interfering material formed\nduring derivatization were the elastomeric seals used in the valve simuThese valves had two external seals, which in the case of the\ntwo derivatization tests were of Viton E-60, which is the material used in\nthe VLBI solenoid valves. It was hoped that even if there were some\nlators.\n\nmaterials problems with the Viton, the metal-to-metal contact surfaces\nbetween the cell contents and the seals would prevent any serious reactions.\n\nApparently this was not the case.\n\nTherefore the static body seal\n\nwas replaced with a Creavey type seal (Teflon encased metal spring).\n\n3-53\n\nInitially, it was thought a Creavey type could not be used here because\nsufficient force to effect the seal might distort the tantalum body. However, further study indicated that the valve could withstand the force\nrequired.\nBecause replacement of the dynamic shaft seal with a nonelastomeric type was very difficult, a brief materials test was carried\nout to see if ethylene propylene rubber (EPR) would be a more suitable\nmaterial.\n\nPortions of Viton and EPR O-rings were put in derivatization\n\nvials and derivatizations carried out.\n\nThe O-ring materials were\n\nremoved, the derivatization products were dissolved in CH 2 CL\nsmall portions were chromatographed.\n\n2\n\n, and\n\nA 0. 5 percent injection of the\n\nsample from the derivatization in the presence of Viton resulted in a\nnumber of relatively large peaks, while in the case of EPR, a 0. 5 percent injection was relatively clean.\n\nHowever, significant peaks were\n\nobserved from the EPR sample when 25 percent of the sample was injected. Thus EPR was a superior material, but it was not certain that it\ncould be successfully used for the shaft seal.\nwere, therefore,\n\nAll four valve simulators\n\nremoved from the derivatizer and disassembled.\n\nThe\n\nViton O-ring shaft seals were replaced with ethylene-propylene rubber\nO-rings.\n\nThe Viton O-ring external seals were replaced with Creavey\n\nseals.\nThe derivatizer itself was cleaned, reassembed, and baked out.\n\nA\n\nstandard mixture of amino acid derivatives (2. 5 nanomole each of Ala,\nVal, Leu, Gly,\n\np-Ala, Pro, Phe, Glu) dissolved in 0.4 milliliters of\n\nwas introduced through S-9, and the methylene chloride was evap-\n\nCH C1\n\norated off at -5 0 C through the vent (S-6).\n\n(See Figure 3-1 for the deriv-\n\natizer flow schematic and valve notation.)\n\nA Carbowax 20M GC column\n\nwas connected to the GC port (S-8), and a gas line was connected to S-9\nport.\n\nGas was then swept into S-9 through the derivatizer and out S-8\n\nand then into the column.\n\nAtfer flow was started (15 cc/min), the deriv-\n\natizer was slowly heated to 150 0 C to evaporate the derivatives onto the\ncolumn.\n\nSubsequent gas chromatographic analysis gave good results with\n\nall the amino acid derivative peaks being present at the expected level\nincluding glutamic acid (which had not been observed in earlier tests with\nstandard derivatives).\n\nThere were several other unidentified peaks\n3-54\n\npresent in the chromatogram at levels similar to the amino acid\nderivatives which may have been the last traces of the interfering material produced in previous tests, or it may have been some material outgassing from theS-8 and S-9 valve shaft seals.\nAfter baking the derivatizer under vacuum, another full derivatization test was carried out.\n\nTwenty-five nanomoles each of Val, Pro, Phe\n\nand Glu were introduced through S-9 in\n\nI milliliter of H20.\n\nH20 was evaporated off, and the S-9 inlet line dried.\n\nThe\n\nTwo millileters of\n\n2-butanol/HC1 was then injected through S-9 using the breadboard\n2-butanol/HC1 reservoir.\n\nAfter heating at 100 0 C for 3 hours, the reagent\n\nwas evaporated with the heater controllers set at 700C.\n\nThe S-9 inlet\n\nline was dried, and atfer the derivatizer had cooled to 30 0 C, 0. 4 milliliter of TFA/CHzCI\nreservoir.\n\n2\n\nwas injected through S-9 using the TFA/CH 2 C1 2\n\nAfter 1 hour, the unit was cooled to -50C,\n\nCHzC1 2 was evaporated for 30 minutes.\n\nand the TFA/\n\nThe S-9 line was briefly heated,\n\nand then the product of the derivatization process was evaporated onto a\nCarbowax 20M column attached to GC column port (S-8) with He being\nswept through the unit entering via S-9.\n\nThe subsequent chromatogram\n\nwas much better than those from the previous two derivatization tests,\nalthough there was interference through much of the chromatogram. No\namino acid derivative peaks were identified.\n\nThe Val and Pro derivatives\n\ncould not have been detected because of the interferences.\n\nHowever, the\n\nbaseline was sufficiently stable in the time period where the Phe and Glu\nderivative peaks would be expected for the peaks to be detected if present.\nIt was hypothesized that the large amount of material in the column\nresulted in a change in the retention characteristics in the column so that\nthe Phe and Glu peaks were not eluted at the expected time.\nThe GC column was purged for several hours at 2000C and then\ntested with standard derivatives.\n\nUnlike the first two derivatization\n\ntests, the column was found to be functioning normally which again indicated significant reduction in the amount of interfering material produced.\nWhile the changes made thus far had improved the result, it was\nobvious that major problems remained.\n\nFurther consideration of the\n\nderivatizer operation led to the conclusion that use of the same inlet line\nand hence the same valve for both reagents and for the helium might be\n3-55\n\ncontributing to the problem since the valve shaft seal was exposed to a\ndegree to the reagents and then was exposed while the cell was heated to\nevaporate the derivatives into the GC column.\n\nBy bringing the helium\n\ninto the derivatizer through S-7 as was designed for full breadboard operation, S-9 would be closed during the evaporation onto the column step and\nhence any reaction products between the O-ring and the reagents which\nwere adsorbed onto the O-ring would not be volatilized and swept into the\ncolumn.\n\nThe helium line going to S-7 had not been used in the past\n\nbecause it was connected with the line going to SC-2 (to provide He for\nthe hydrolyzer and evaporator), and occasionally aqueous solutions got\ninto the line.\n\nTherefore, the gas lines were rerouted to prevent this.\n\nPrior to the changes, the He lines going to SC-2 and to S-7 were connected after LV-14.\n\nIn the new routing, LV-14 was used as a three-way\n\nvalve with separate lines to SC-2 and S-7 to prevent any water from\ngetting into the derivatizer via the He lines.\nThe overall post-test appearance of the derivatizer was good.\nHowever, the Creavey seal between the cell body and the head-end was\nfound to have failed.\n\nThe Teflon had taken a set and had cracked.\n\nUpon\n\nclose examination, corrosion of the inner stainless steelspring was\nobserved.\n\nPrevious tests with unstressed Creavey seals had indicated\n\nthat they were reasonably compatible with the derivatization process.\ntest was carried out with a stressed Creavey seal.\n\nA\n\nThis seal also dev-\n\neloped a set and cracked during the derivatization, leading to the conclusion that a replacement seal for the Creavey seals in the derivatizer was\nrequired.\nAfter a new Creavey seal was installed for the cell seal, the unit\nwas baked out and another standard derivative evaporation test was\ncarried out to check out the new flow routing and to check for any interfering material.\n\n2. 5 nanomoles each of the eight standard amino acid\n\nderivatives used in the previous evaporation test were introduced and the\ntest carried out in a similar manner except for the use of S-7 as the He\ninlet.\n\nThe chromatogram after evaporation of the derivatives on the\n\nCarbowax 20M column was similar to that from the previous standard\namino acid derivative evaporation test. All the amino acid derivative\npeaks were observed and there were several interfering peaks present\n3-56\n\nat levels similar to the amino acid derivative peaks.\n\nThus it appears\n\nthat a small amount of interfering material was produced even in a simple\nevaporation test.\n\nThis material is thought to come from the seals either\n\nby simple outgassing or because of action of methylene chloride on the\nseals.\nAfter a vacuum bakeout, a full derivatization procedure was again\ncarried out.\n\nThe procedure was identical to the previous full derivatiza-\n\ntion test except for the use of S-7 rather than S-9 for the He inlet.\n\nThe\n\ngas chromatographic results were much better than the previous test.\nThe amount of interfering material while still present in large quantity\nwas greatly reduced and, for the first time, the peaks corresponding to\nthe derivatives of the four original amono acids (25 nanomoles each of\nVal, Pro, Phe and Glu) were identified in the chromatogram.\n\nThis was\n\na significant result because it meant that the breadboard derivatizer\nwould be functional once the large amount of interfering material produced was eliminated.\n\nThe remaining interferences were similar in\n\nsize to the 25 nanomole amino acid derivative peaks so a significant\nreduction in the interfering material was still required.\nIt was felt that most of the problem still resulted from the breadboard seals and hence would not occur or could be avoided in a flight type\nunit.\n\nThe need for frequent disassembly and cleaning on the breadboard\n\ncaused the selection of the type of seals then in use, but further work on\nimproved seals was needed.\nEffort was then directed at finding replacement seals for the valve\nsimulator shaft seals and for the main cell body seal.\nhowever,\n\nIt was desirable,\n\nto determine what part of the derivatization process was causing\n\nthe remaining interference in order to attack the problem in an effective\nmanner.\n\nThis was accomplished by breaking down the various steps and\n\ncarrying them out partially in the derivatizer and partially in lab glassware.\n\nTo determine if some of the interference was being washed in with\n\nthe reagents through the injection lines,\n\nthe reagents were injected into\n\nthe derivatizer head end with the bottom removed so that they could be\ncollected in a standard lab derivatization vial and a normal lab derivatization carried out.\n\n3-57\n\nThe test was carried out by injecting 2 milliliters of 2-butanol/HC1,\ncollecting in the derivatization vial and heating the reagents for 3 hours at\n1000 followed by evaporating to dryness in the vial using the normal lab\nprocedure. In the meantime the derivatizer head end and associated lines\nwere dried by heating and gas flow.\n\nThe vial was taken back to the deri-\n\nvatizer and 0.4 milliliter of TFA/CHzC1 was injected through the derivatizer head end. The derivatization was continued in the normal lab\nmanner and the resulting derivative was analyzed by gas chromatography.\nThe chromatogram did show some interfering peaks, but it, in general,\nwas not significantly different from a regular lab derivatization blank\nwhich was carried out at the same time. Therefore, it appeared that\nheating of the reagents in the derivatizer was required to form the large\nThe\namount of interfering material found in derivatizer derivatizations.\nshaft seal on the vent valve (S-6) was especially suspect since it is\nexposed to hot 2-butanol/HC1 during the 2-butanol/HC1 evaporation step;\nand since this seal is upstream of the flow restrictor, it would be easy\nfor material formed from attack by 2-butanol/HC1 to get back into the cell.\nFollowing the head end test, the entire derivatizer was cleaned and\nreturned to the engineering laboratory for work to develop new nonelastomeric seals.\n\nSince the Creavey seal used as the main cell body\n\nseal had not held up well, a special tantalum metal seal was constructed.\nThis seal in conjunction with Teflon gaskets (to prevent galling) appeared\nto seal satisfactorily.\n\nAs an expedient, split Teflon o-rings were instal-\n\nled in place of the elastomeric O-rings on the valve shafts.\n\nInitial leak\n\ntests indicated that they might seal adequately so the derivatizer was\nreassembled using split Teflon O-rings as the shaft seals; the tantalum\nseal was used at the cell body seal; and Creavey seals were used for the\nvalve external seals.\n\nAfter further leak tests in the engineering laboraThe unit\n\ntory, the unit was brought back for further derivatizer testing.\nwas baked out for a short period and cooled.\n\nA standard derivative mix-\n\nture in CHZC1 2 was introduced into the cell and the CHZC1 2 was evaporated off at -50\n\nC\n\nGC column.\n\nSeal performance during this test was marginal.\n\n.\n\nThe sample was then evaporated onto a Carbowax 20M\n\nshaft seal leaked badly when the unit was chilled.\n\nThe S-6\n\nEither or both the\n\nS-7 and S-8 shaft seals leaked moderately at room temperature.\nseals did appear to seal adequately at elevated temperatures.\n3-58\n\nThe\n\nThe\n\nresulting chromatogram showed a large, very broad interference peak,\nbut no identifiable amino acid peaks. The derivatizer was cleaned as a\ntotal unit and the cell was baked out and the derivative mixture test was\nrepeated. The results were similar to the first test. The broad interference peak was somewhat smaller, but there were still no amino acid\nderivative peaks. Since earlier derivatizer testing with derivative mixtures was successful, it appeared that the changes made on the seals had\ncaused some sort of problem.\nA third trial at derivative evaporation led to a repeat of prior\nresults - a major broad peak about half the size of the previous run but\nwith small (about 1 percent full scale) humps occurring at locations\nappropriate for amino acids.\nBecause the last run gave some indication that amino acids were\ncoming out of the derivatizer but that most were being destroyed, another\nrun was made to test the hypothesis that water was getting into the cell\nand destroying the amino acids. Valve leaks were observed in the above\ntests, especially in cooling.\n\nFor this test 10 nanomoles each of the\n\nstandard a. a. derivatives was injected into the derivatizer followed by a 200\nmicroliter methylene chloride wash. Without cooling or evaporating the\nsolvent, the sample was evaporated into the GC column. This test too\nresulted in no amino acid peaks. The cell was dismantled and badly\ncorroded valves were discovered.\n\nThus the split Teflon O-rings were\n\nnot effective in preventing the reagents from attacking the back stainless\nsteel portion of the valve simulators.\n\nApparently the corrosion products\n\ncaused the decomposition of the derivatives when evaporation of the derivatives onto the column was attempted. Therefore, the old valve simulators were abandoned and new all tantalum valves described in Section\n3. 1. 6 were built as replacements.\nFor the first use with all tantalum and Teflon the standard derivative evaporation test was run with 25 nanomoles of each amino acid.\n\nUpon\n\nheating to evaporate the amino acids onto the column, thermal expansion\ncaused the valve to close above 750C, preventing He flow. Therefore,\nevaporation onto the column was carried out at 700C. The resulting\nchromatogram was quite good however, with only glutamic acid smaller\n\n3-59\n\nthan expected.\n\nThis indicates that only 75 0 C is necessary to evaporate\n\nderivatives through phenylanine.\nAfter some additional valve modifications,\n\nfull derivatization was then\n\nattempted in the unit on an aqueous solution of amino acids (25 nanomoles\nThe solution was injected into the breadboard derivatizer,\n\neach).\n\nevap-\n\norated to dryness at 500C under vacuum and derivatized with butanol/HC1\nand trifluoracetic anhydride/methylene chloride.\n\nValves were barely\nThe GC\n\nfunctional for this test, sticking closed on several occasions.\nresults, however,\n\nwere positive, as shown in Figure 3-23.\n\nOne large\n\nunknown peak is present between Leucine and Glycine and the glutamic\npeak is\n\nsomewhat smaller than expected.\n\nOn the basis of this good result, an end to end system test was run\nin order to use the full breadboard (several hydrolyzer through IEC\ntests had already been completed successfully) as a system and to run\na soil derivative in the derivatizer cell.\n\nValves were reworked prior\n\nto this test so that they functioned reliably.\n\nThe soil for this end to end\n\ntest was Waukena diluted with blank soil (25 percent Waukena) to reduce\nthe amino acid content in the sample below 50 nanomoles since the GC\ncolumn starts to show overloading effects with more than 50 nanomoles.\nSmall quantities of 14C labeled amino acids were also added to the soil\nto aid in monitoring the intermediate steps.\n\nThe chromatogram ultimately\n\nresulting from the end to end test showed a very large broad peak which\nmasked any possible amino acid peaks.\n\nUpon opening the derivatizer\n\ncell, approximately one-third the radioactivity was recovered,\n\nindicating\n\na large percentage of the sample was not transferred to the GC column.\nFurthermore,\n\nit was observed in the laboratory glassware control that\n\nthe sample contained a waxy solid, apparently peculiar to the blank\nsoil as it has not been observed in Waukena soil samples.\nAfter thorough cell cleanup,\n\ntwo standard derivative mixtures were\n\ninjected into the derivatizer cell to confirm the unit was still functional.\nFirst 25 nanomoles were chromatographed successfully followed by 2.5\nnanomoles as seen in Figure 3-24 (new chromatogram 4).\n\nThese tests\n\nconfirmed that the cell was sealed, no obvious material problems existed,\nand the nominal injection procedure was functional.\n\n3-60\n\nBREADBOARD DERIVATIZATION TEST\n25 NANOMOLES EACH OF TEN AMINO ACIDS INJECTED AS WATER\n- SOLUTION, EVAPORATED TO DRYNESS AND DERIVATIZED.\nDERIVATIVES EVAPORATED ONTO CARBOWAX 20 M COLUMN,\n_PROGRAMMED 1000 TO 2000 C AT 20C/MIN\n__\n\nGLYL PRO\n\nVAL =ALA\nEU\n\n-\n\nLEUe\n\nFigure 3-23.\n\n\'ALA\n\nA Pard\n\nPHE GLU\n\nChromatogram, Breadboard Derivatization Test\n\n--\n\n..\n......\n\n..\n\n4B112\n\nFE\n\n~r\n\nVARIN PALO\nABSOCIATEII pIVJ1ON\nALTO, I.CORDEB NO.\nCALIF.\nCHAT\n1A\nSTANDARD DERIVATIVES (APPROXIMATELY\n\n====-21/2\n,ANMOLES\n\nEACH) INJECTED INTO\n\nDRAIZER AND EVAPORATED OUT ONTO\nCARBOWAX 20 M COLUMN, PROGRAMMED\nFRIOM 100" TO 175 oC AT 2 *C/MIN,\n\nIBREADBOARD\n\nIII\n\nFigure\n\n3-24.\n\nDERATIZER INJECTION TEST\n\nIi\n\nChromatogram,\n\nHill\n\nBreadboard\n\nDerivatizer\n\nInjection\n\nTest\n\nA derivatization starting with a pure aqueous solution of amino\nacids (25 nanomoles each) was then performed.

Furthermore, it was concluded that\nthis material was not soluable in CH 2 C\n\n2\n\nand hence did not interfere with\n\nlab samples since the derivatives in those samples were dissolved in\nCH 2l12 in order to inject them into the gas chromatograph. Thus the\nproblem with soil derived samples arose as a part of the heating of the\nderivatizer to volatize the derivatives.\n\nThe interfering material may\n\nhave come from the soil itself, or it may have come from the ion exchange\ncolumn. It did appear that the amount of material present in lab derivatization vials was soil dependent.\n\nHowever, the material still could be\n\ncoming from the ion exchange resin since the amount and nature of the\nsalts from the soil could affect the amount of material released by the\nresin.\nThe hypothesis that the problem with soil derived samples was from\nvolatization of an interfering organic material was tested as follows:\n\na\n\n25 percent aliquot of a sample derived from 14C labeled Waukena soil\nprocessed as usual through the IEC step was injected into the derivatizer\n\n3-63\n\ncell and derivatized.\n\nThe cell was then opened and the final product\n\ndissolved in methylene chloride.\n\nThe chromatogram of 20 percent of\n\ntotal sample (Figure 3-25) showed all amino acids with no extraneous\npeaks prior to glutamic acid.\nThis demonstrated that the derivatizer was functional up to the\npoint of derivative injection onto the CG column, and tends to confirm\nthat the extraneous peaks seen in previous tests were caused by\nvolatilization of material not soluble in methylene chloride.\nSeveral days later, the derivatizer was reassembled and heated\nwith the nominal CG injection procedure to volatize any material remaining in the cell onto the CG column for analysis.\n\nOnly a small baseline\n\nincrease was observed in the chromatogram indicating that a large amount\nof material was not driven out of the derivatizer into the CG column.\nis not known why so little material was seen in this test.\nnon-CH2Cl\n\n2\n\nIt\n\nPossibly the\n\nsoluble material was lost or decomposed while the deriva-\n\ntizer was open and exposed to air.\nIt is possible that the interfering material seen in the end to end\ntests with Process No. 1 may not occur with the new baseline process.\nFurther testing with the current cell may elucidate methods of circumventing the interfering material.\n\nRemoval of all non-metallic components\n\nmay be of value since the interfering material may be absorbed in the\nTeflon.\n\nUse of a different CG liquid phase may also reduce the effect of\n\nthe interfering material.\nIf other solutions are unsatisfactory, it should be possible to carry\nout sample removal from the derivatizer and sample introduction onto the\nCG column in a manner similar to laboratory methods by extracting the\nderivatives out of the derivatizer with CH 2 C1 2 and transferring the solution to another small cell which would then be used to evaporate the\nderivatives into the column.\n\n(Prior low temperature evaporation of the\n\nmethylene chloride into the vent might be necessary.)\nAfter cleaning the derivatizer and installing new seals, the final\ntest which was derivatization of optically active amino acids with optically\nactive 2-butanol/HC1 was carried out.\n\nThe only difference between this\n\ntest and previous tests with pure amino acids was the use of optically\n3-64\n\nWAuNr CREEK.\nCALIP\n\n.A.TWaan\n1* o\n0\n\nIN\n\nFra\nI17 LEFT\n\na-m.1\n\n.

This\nmodel was constructed from a 100 foot of 0. 062 inch OD by 0. 0023 inch\nID section of stainless steel tube wound on a fiberglass mandrel and was\ninstrumented with five thermocouples. The tests were conducted in a\nvacuum to provide a thermal environment similar to the heavily insulated\nflight design concept. The column was programmed over a range of 250\nto 250 0 C in the self-heated mode.\n\nNo temperature control problems were\n\nobserved.\nBased on the satisfactory performance of the model, the prototype\nself-heated column described in Section 3. 1. 7 was designed and fabricated.\nAfter the prototype column was completed, except for installation of the\nspool in the can and packing with the liquid phase, engineering thermal\ntests were conducted with the column packed in insulation to simulate the\nfinal configuration.\n\nThe temperatures recorded (at approximately steady\n\nstate) using the center thermocouple for the control (TC No. 4, Figure\n3-17) are shown in Table 3-4.\nThe temperature difference between the middle of the column\n(TC No. 4 and TC No. 6) and the portions of the column at the ends of the\nspool appeared to be caused by the higher conductive losses resulting\nfrom contact with the aluminum spool.\n\nThe flight design, which uses a\n\nthermal insulator for the spool, should have much lower thermal losses\n3-66\n\nBREADBOARD\nRATZATIONOF\nAMINOACID\nEACH\n25 NANOMoLES\n\n100\nPROGRAMMED CTO 175\nMIN.\n\nwaum\nanny\n\nn\n\nrm\n\ne AT2 \'C/\n\ne\n\n..... .....\n..... ....\n---\n\n---\n\nlil\n\nII\n\nACTIVE -2 C\n(\nWITHOPTICALLY\nMHENE\nE +\n/H1lH\nBOWAX PROGRAMMED\nONTO\n20M COLUMN\nEVAPORATED\n\nLEIT\nREFERENCE\nCHROMAOGAM OF LABORATORYWITH\nOPTICALL\nDERIVATIZED\nAMINOACIDS\nACTIVE\n(+)-2- BUTANOL/HCMETHYLENE\nL\nCHLORIDE LIINIJCTED OTO\nS\n20BOAXM\nCOLUMNPROGRAMMED\nASABOVE.\n\nFigure 3-26.\n\nChromatogram, Breadboard Derivitization\n\n3-67\n\nTable 3-4.\nControl\n(TC No. 4)\n\nTC\nNo. 1\n\nSteady-State Temperatures\n\nTC\nNo. 2\n\nTC\nNo. 3\n\nTC\nNo. 6\n\nTC\nNo. 5\n\nTC\nNo. 7\n\n920C\n\n80\n\n84\n\n80\n\n77\n\n92\n\n81\n\n1400C\n\n122\n\n128\n\n124\n\n122\n\n137\n\n122\n\n2040C\n\n179\n\n189\n\n184\n\n182\n\n190\n\n179\n\nAlso,\n\nat the spool ends.\n\nsome improvement was expected with the\n\nprototype when it was installed in the can and packed with the aluminum\noxide insulation.\n\nAfter installation in the can and addition of the aluminum\n\noxide sphere insulation, the column was coated with Carbowax 20M via the\nstandard procedure resulting in a 46 milligram loading.\n\nIt had been\n\nplanned to heat the column using an SCR type linear temperature programmer.\n\nHowever, AC feedback through the control thermocouple\n\noccurred and interfered with operation of the temperature programmer.\nTherefore, the column was heated with a DC power supply and a thermocouple on-off controller.\n\nTemperature programming was accomplished\n\nby applying sufficient power to the column to obtain the approximate rate\nof rise desired.\n\nThe thermocouple controller was used to set the upper\n\ntemperature limit.\nTo evaluate if the column was properly coated,\n\nit was installed in\n\na GC oven and held isothermally and operated as a normal column.\n\nThe\n\nresulting chromatograms with standard derivatives showed good resolution and separation.\n\nNext, several chromatograms were run in a self-\n\nheated mode, but they were not interpretable,\ninsufficient conditioning of the column.\n\napparently because of\n\nThere did not appear to be any\n\ninteraction between the column heating power supply and the GC detector\nelectrometer even though insulating unions were not used (power was\napplied to the middle of the column with the two ends being at ground\npotential).\nAfter additional conditioning, the column gave much better results.\nInjection of standard derivatives into the cold column followed by programming the column in a self-heated mode at approximately 20C/min\n(ballistically) gave good results through proline, but the later peaks were\n3-68\n\npoor as shown in the upper curve in Figure 3-27. It was felt that this was\na result of cold spots somewhere in the system either in the column itself\nor in the line between the column and the detector. Modifications were\nmade to the connecting line heater to ensure that it was adequately heated\nwhich did not affect the chromatogram.\n\nThus,\n\nit was concluded that there\n\nmust be cold spots within the self-heated column itself. The most likely\narea for these cold spots was the interface plate where the column and the\nelectrical leads were fed through.\n\nTo test the cold spot hypothesis, the\n\ncolumn was put in a GC oven such that after injection onto the cold column,\nthe outside of the column was heated by heating the GC oven to 170 0 C.\nThis external heating had only a small effect on the column temperature\nas a whole because of the high degree of insulation. The column itself\nwas operated self-heated in the same manner as before.

Instead, evaluation of the valve simulators is based on their performance while in use on the breadboard. In\ngeneral, the original valve simulators worked reasonably well in that part\nThe\nof the breadboard where they were only exposed to aqueous reagents.\nvalve simulator used on the hydrolyzer did have some leakage problems\nbut this was probably caused by soil particles getting in the valve.\n\nThe\n\nbreadboard hydrolyzer valve was a slightly larger design than those used\nin the rest of the system and hence had a larger sealing surface and was\nmore prone to leakage.\n\nIt is recommended that the outlet valve block on\n\nthat unit be replaced with one which will accommodate the smaller valves.\nNo significant problems were encountered with the valve simulators on the\nevaporator, ion exchange column, and the SC-i, SC-2 valve block.\n\nSome\n\nexternal corrosion of the outer stainless steel parts occurred because of\nthe generally corrosive environment of the breadboard.\n\nThis external\n\ncorrosion did not cause any problem except in one case where the spring\nin the simulator degraded and did not apply adequate force.\n\nThis was\n\ncorrected by replacing the spring.\nAs discussed in Section 3. 2. 1.4, the original valve simulators\nwere not satisfactory when used on the derivatizer.\n\nThe original valve\n\nwould not function without an elastomeric shaft seal and the elastomers\nproduced interfering material in the derivatization.\n\nThese results lead\n\nto the design and fabrication of a valve simulator which had only tantalum\nand Teflon exposed to the derivatization reagents.\n\nEarly versions of the\n\nall tantalum valves had some mechanical problems which caused the valve\nto close when heated, but the final version worked quite well and much\nbetter results were obtained with the derivatizer when these valves were\nused.\n\nIt appears that flight valves with characteristics similar to the all\n\ntantalum/Teflon valve simulators will work satisfactorily throughout the\nsystem with either Process No.\n\n1 or the new baseline process.\n\n3-72\n\n3. 2. 2\n\nBreadboard System Tests\nFollowing breadboard component tests, various\n\nwere carried out, primarily with the hydrolyzer,\n\nsystem level tests\n\nevaporator,\n\nand ion\n\nexchange column combined so that the entire soil processing and desalting\nportion of the experiment was tested as a system.\n\nAlso, two complete\n\nbreadboard "end-to-end" tests were conducted with the entire breadboard\ntested as a unit with only the gas chromatographic analysis being perforThe number of system tests and the\n\nmed outside of the breadboard.\n\nnumber of soils used were limited because the interfering material\nproblems from the ion exchange resin and the Teflon filters, and the interference problems with the derivatizer prevented meaningful tests from\nbeing conducted earlier in the program.\nThe basic conclusions reached concerning the system level breadboard testing was that most of the results were very favorable.\n\nThe\n\nradiotracer recoveries for the hydrolyzer through IEC portion of the processing ranged from 54 to 82 percent.\n\nHowever, the recoveries were\n\nreduced by the various operational problems,\nthe IEC caused by gas being pushed through it.\nand the known losses,\n\nprimarly, channelization of\nBased on component tests\n\n85 to 95 percent recovery could be expected in the\nFreedom from\n\nabsence of problems associated with manual operation.\n\nracemization was demonstrated which is a most important result.\n\nProb-\n\nlems observed were the continuing low level contamination produced from\nthe Teflon filter material, and the derivatization problems which occurred\nin the end to end tests.\n\nIn changing from Process No.\n\n1 to Process No.\n\n2\n\nmost of the difficulties encountered in the system level testing should not\noccur or should be minimized.\nstep in Process No.\n\nBecause of the deletion of a precipitation\n\n2, there will be no difficulty in transferring processed\n\nsolution into the 5 milliliter IEC,\n\nand hence channelization can easily be\n\navoided and losses of amino acids from this cause will be eliminated.\nThus,\n\namino acid recovery (excluding extraction efficiency considerations)\n\nshould be high (~90 percent) for the processing part of the breadboard with\nProcess No.\n\n2.\n\nAs discussed in component testing, contamination from\n\nthe Teflon filters can probably be reduced or eliminated.\n\nThe remaining\n\nsignificant problem is that associated with evaporating derivatives out of\nthe derivatizer and onto the GC column,\n\n3-73\n\nand, as discussed in Section\n\n3.2. 1.4 (derivatizer component testing), at least one solution does exist\nfor this problem.\nIn summary, with either Process No. 1 or Process No. 2, we have\ngreat confidence that a successful experiment can be carried out and in\nchanging to Process No. 2, most of the problems we have experienced\nwill not occur or can be solved readily.\n3. 2. 2. 1 Hydrolyzer Through Ion Exchange Column System Tests\nSystem Blank:\n\nThe hydrolyzer, the SC-I, SC-2 valve block, the\n\nevaporator, and the ion exchange column were connected in the nominal\nsystem configuration as shown in Figure 3-1.\nbeen substituted for NaOH).\n\n(At this time NH40H had\n\nThe only deviation in the system flow path\n\nwas the absence of the liquid level sensor.\n\nThe filters used in the hyd-\n\nrolyzer and evaporator were the usual combination of backup, 10 micron,\n5 micron, backup Teflon filters. These filters were soxhlet-extracted\nwith 6N HC1 prior to use.\n\nAfter assembly, the hydrolyzer and evaporator\n\nwere heated with 6N HC1 and rinsed with distilled water.\nwere not passed into the ion exchange column (IEC).\n\nThese rinsings\n\nThe processing was\n\ncarried out for the standard times with the reagents specified for Process\nNo.\n\n1.\n\nThe only difference between this test and a soil test was the\n\nabsence of soil.\nPhenolphthalein was added to the 10 milliliter evaporator wash to\nmonitor the IEC effluent.\n\nThe collection of the 7 milliliters of IEC effluent\n\nfollowing NH40H breakthrough included the 0.3 milliliter of solution which\nwas in the 1/8-inch Teflon line connected to the IEC outlet prior to the\nappearance of the phenolphthalein color.\nEvaporation of the NH40H and the subsequent derivatization steps\nwere carried out in the lab glassware.\n\nThere were several significant\n\ninterfering peaks in the gas chromatogram (Carbowax 20M column) similar to those observed in ion exchange column blanks (Section 3. 2. 1.3).\nThe two largest interferences were one of approximately 30 nanomoles\nnear valine, and one of 130 nanomoles near leucine (later demonstrated\nto be trifluoroacetamide).\nA number of amino acids were detected, including 16 nanomole Ala,\n25 nanomole Gly, 4 nanomole 3 -Ala, 6 nanomole Pro, 6 nanomole Phe,\n3-74\n\n11 nanomole Glu.\n\nInterfering peaks prevented the measurement of Val,\n\nLeu, and Asp, but the maximum quantity of Asp plus interference is 18\nnanomole. These amino acid quantities were lower than previous breadThe Teflon filters are\n\nboard evaporator blanks but still were excessive.\n\nstill felt to be a likely source of amino acid contamination.\nWaukena Soil Test:\n\nExcept for the IEC, only minor cleaning was\n\nrequired to ready the breadboard for the soil test after the system blank.\nThe hydrolyzer was rinsed with redistilled water, the evaporator was\nflushed with 6N HC1 and then redistilled water.\n\nThe liquid level sensor\n\nwas washed with HC1 and water and installed in the liquid path out of the\nevaporator.\nneutrality.\n\nThe IEC was regenerated with HC1 and then washed to\nDuring the wash, the column was backflushed for a while to\n\nattempt to reduce any channelization which might have occurred in earlier\ntesting.\nThe Teflon filters in the hydrolyzer and evaporator were not\nreplaced for this test since after rinsing they should have been even\ncleaner than before the system blank.\nThe sample used for the test was 1 cubic centimeter of Waukena soil\nto which 2 microliter quantities of 14C labeled amino acid solutions were\nadded.\n\nThe radiotracers provided approximately 200, 000 DPM each of\n\nproline, phenylalanine and glutamic acid.\n\nThe hydrolysis, evaporation\n\nand HF/NH40H processing steps were carried out satisfactorily.\n\nThe\n\nfiltration step was very slow, approximately 0. 2 cc/min at 20 psi pressure\ndifferential.\n\nThe restriction was apparently caused by the precipitate\n\nclogging the Teflon filters.\n\nThe time required for filtration at this rate\n\nwas excessive, and it was felt desirable to change the filter configuration\nor to increase the pressure across the evaporator.\n\nGas was pushed\n\nthrough the IEC during transfer of the evaporator rinse.\n\nChannelization\n\nof the IEC evidently occurred because of this gas event since early breakthrough of some radioactivity (~5 percent of the initial quantity) was detected in the IEC effluent during the 30 milliliter column wash.\n\nThe amount\n\nof radioactivity detected in the 7 milliliters of solution after ammonia\nbreakthrough was 81 percent of the initial quantity.\n\nAnother 7 percent\n\nwas accounted for in the accumulated column wash and pre and post 7\nmilliliter samples.\n3-75\n\nA similar sample of Waukena soil was processed in laboratory\nSome of the filtrate from the HF/NH40H processing was lost so the overall radiotracer recovery was reduced. The\nglassware as a control.\n\n7 milliliter fraction of the ion exchange effluent after NH40OH breakthrough\ncontained 76 percent of the initial radioactivity. Derivatization in laboratory glassware and gas chromatographic analyses were completed on the\nbreadboard and lab Waukena soil processing samples. Table 3-4 summarizes the radiotracer results.\n\nThe derivatized samples were analyzed by\n\ngas chromatography on a Carbowax 20M column. The chromatograms\nfrom the breadboard and lab samples were very similar except that the\nbreadboard sample gave larger amino acid derivative peaks as would be\nexpected from the fact that the overall radiotracer recovery was greater\nfor the breadboard sample.\n\nThe average ratio of the breadboard sample\n\npeak areas to the lab sample peak areas was 1.41 (Table 3-5), close to\nThe interfering\n\nthe ratio of overall radiotracer recovery which was 1. 37.\n\npeak thought to be caused by trifluoroacetamide (which occurs at the leucine position on Carbowax 20M) was larger in the lab sample than in the\nbreadboard sample.\nTable 3-4.\n\nThe overall results of the test are considered good.\n\nBreadboard Hydrolyzer Through IEC Waukena Soil\nTest-Radiotracer Results\nLab Sample\n\nBreadboard Sample\nDPM\nInitial quantity\n(Pro, Phe, Glu)\n\nPercent\nRecovery\n\nDPM\n\nPercent\nRecovery\n\n614, 000\n\n614, 000\n\nIon Exchange\n27,\n\n2 0 0a\n\nColumn Wash\n\n27,\n\nPrecuts\n\n11,600\n\nPrime Fraction\nPostcut\nRecovered in Clean up\n\n495, 000\n\n2 0 0b\n\n5, 058\n80. 6\n\n470, 000\n\n800\n\n1,350\n\n31,300\n\n76.5\n\n5,410\n\nTotal counts accounted for\nthru ion exchange step\n\n566,500\n\n92.3\n\n481,800\n\n78.5\n\nFinal Derivative\n\n355,500\n\n57.9\n\n259,500\n\n42.3\n\naCollected during 30 milliliter column wash prior to NH 4 0H elution.\nbApproximately 25 percent of sample lost by spillage.\n3-76\n\nTable 3-5.\n\nBreadboard Hydrolyzer Through IEC Waukena Soil\nTest- Chromatographic Re sults\n\nAmino Acid\n\nPeak Area\nBreadboard\nProcessed\nSample\n\nRatio Breadboard/Lab\n\nLab\nProcessed\nSample\n\nVala\n\n161,400\n\n120,600\n\n1.33\n\nAla & 1 Leu\n\n746, 100\n\n493, 100\n\n1.51\n\nLeu + NH3\n\n667, 700\n\n1,268,000\n\nLeua\n\n213,500\n\n173,200\n\n1.23\n\nGly\n\n546,000\n\n346,100\n\n1.31\n\n74,400\n\n52,500\n\n1.42\n\nPro + unknown\n\n323, 700\n\n170,300\n\n1.\n\nAsp\n\n693,900\n\n400,200\n\n1. 73\n\nPhe\n\n203,000\n\n182,500\n\n1.11\n\nGlu\n\n604,400\n\n368,700\n\n1.64\n\nP-Ala\n\n0.53 b\n\n9 0b\n\naverage\nratio\n1.41\nConditions: Carbowax 20M column 0. 030 id x 200 ft., Varian 1860\nGas Chromatograph Electrometer setting 1 x 10-11 amps.

of the breadboard components during\n\ncleaning indicated that the components were still in good condition.\n\nThe\n\nCreavey seal in the hydrolyzer showed some corrosion of the inner stainless steel

no evidence\nof attack.\n\n3-77\n\nCleaning Tests.\n\nThe hydrolyzer filters were replaced with new\n\nsoxhlet-extracted ones of the same type.\n\nIn the case of the evaporator, a\n\nnew type of Teflon filter cloth was used as the upper filter in an attempt\nto prevent clogging that occurred with the type of filter cloth previously\nused.\nBecause the previous system blank had shown significant quantities\nof amino acids and other material, some cleaning tests were conducted to\nsee if additional cleaning in the assembled units would reduce the amount\nof contamination.\n\nAfter the usual cleaning procedure which consists of\n\nseveral short soaks with hot 6N HC 1 and rinses with distilled water, prolonged heatings of the hydrolyzer and evaporator were carried out with\n6N HC1 in the units.\n\nAfter these heatings,\n\norated to dryness and derivatized.\n\nevap-\n\nthe HCI was collected,\n\nThe resulting derivatives were analy-\n\nzed by gas chromatography to determine how much material was present\nand if the samples from the second heatings of the two units were any\nbetter than the first.\nHC1 was used\n\nIn the case of the hydrolyzer,\n\n7.5 milliliters of 6N\n\nwith the cell being heated for 18 hours at 1000C.\n\nThe\n\nresulting derivatives showed a number of peaks, both amino acid and\nnon-amino acid.\n\nThe amount of amino acids was smaller in the second\n\nsample than in the first, but the results were complex for the non-amino\nacid material, and the overall quantity of non-amino acid material\nappeared to be larger in the second sample than in the first.\nIn the case of the evaporator,\nagain for 18 hours at 100 0 C.\n\n30 milliliter of 6N HC 1 was used,\n\nAfter this period, most of the HC1 solution\n\nwas evaporated from the evaporator.\ncase,\n\nThe remainder (5 milliliter in one\n\n10 milliliter in the other) was collected, evaporated and derivatized\n\nin the derivatization vials.\n\nThe gas chromatographic results were similar\n\nto those from the hydrolyzer in that the amount of amino acids seen in the\nfirst sample were greater than in the second, while the results for the\nnon-amino acid material were complex.\n\nThe overall level of material\n\nfound was greater for the evaporator than for the hydrolyzer.\n\nMost of\n\nthese problems should not occur with the new baseline process because\nthe filtration requirements are much different from Process No.\n\nI and\n\nthe filter design can be altered or in the case of the hydrolyzer/evaporator,\nthe filter may be unnecessary.\n3-78\n\nSystem Blank.\n\nAfter the above cleaning tests, the hydrolyzer and\n\nevaporator were rinsed with redistilled water, the IEC was regenerated\nand a no-soil system blank was run.\n\nThe hydrolysis and evaporation part\n\nof the processing proceeded normally.\n\nThe filtration of the solution after\n\nthe HF-NH40H processing was slow, and 50 psig of He pressure was\nrequired to obtain 0.4 mil/min flow rate.\n\nApparently the new Teflon\n\nfilter cloth was also blocked by the NH 4 F precipitate.\n\nThe liquid level\n\nsensor failed to operate during this test, apparently because of the formation of a conductive path which was present even when gas was passing\nthrough the sensor.\nIEC.\n\nIn this test, only a small amount of gas entered the\n\nThe reaminder of the IEC processing was carried out without diffi-\n\nculty and the 7ml of NH40H effluent was evaporated and derivatized in the\nlab.\n\nIt was obvious after evaporation of the NH 4 0H that a large amount of\n\nmaterial was present in the sample so that only 2. 5 percent (rather than\n25 percent) was injected onto the Carbowax 20M column for gas chromatographic analysis.\n\nThe chromatogram showed a number of interfering\n\npeaks, some of which were very large.\n\nThe peak ascribed to trifluoro-\n\nacetamide indicated a quantity of approximately 2 micromoles, and in\ngeneral this system blank was considerably worse than the one run earlier.\nThe major difference between the two system blanks was the use of a new\ntype of Teflon filter cloth in the evaporator.\nsome of the other filters is Chemplast.\n\nThe source of this filter and\n\nWe have since learned that\n\nChemplast prepares Teflon filters which are replicas of cellulose type\nfilters; that Teflon is sintered over the cellulose material to be replicated\nand that the cellulose is "burned off" during the sintering process.\n\nWe\n\ndid not discuss this with Chemplast, but if such a process has been used\nto prepare the filters, there may have been sufficient organic matter left\nafter the sintering process to result in the contamination that was observed in these tests.\n\nSuch material may not be easily removed by the HC1\n\ncooking procedure used for cleaning and may come out in large amounts\nduring the HF-NH 4 0H processing step.\n\nThis could account for the fact\n\nthat the system blank was much worse than the individual hydrolyzer and\nevaporator HC1 blanks.\nBecause of the filter problems, a series of filter tests was carried\nout in the evaporator which is discussed in Section 3. 3. 25.\nthese tests,\n\nBased on\n\n10-micron Millipore Teflon filters were selected for use in\n3-79\n\nthe remainder of the testing as being the best reagent compatible material\navailable at that time even though they were not completely satisfactory.\nThe breadboard was cleaned, the IEC was repacked and regenerated,\nand then a hydrolyzer through IEC system blank was run. Two nanomoles\neach of 1 4 C labeled alanine, proline .phenylalanine, and glutamic acid were\nadded to monitor amino acid recoveries in a very low level situation.\nAfter the HF/NH4 0H step was complete and transfer of the solution\nto the IEC had started, a large volume of gas was pushed through the\nevaporator and into the IEC even though approximately half of the solution\nApparently the evaporator standpipe was so\n\nwas still in the evaporator.\n\nclose to the filter that the gas was able to push through the liquid and precipitate and flow directly out of the cell. The cell was not being pressurized via the standpipe, but a leak in the external gas lines allowed the\nThis problem was solved by disconnecting\n\nstandpipe to be pressurized.\n\nand capping off the line leading to the standpipe through valve S-2.\n\nThe\n\nflow rate of liquid out of the evaporator was very slow when it was flowing\nproperly, being 0. 1 ml/min.\n\nIncreasing the pressure on the cell did not\n\nappear to cause much change in flow rate. Apparently the additional\npressure compresses the precipitate so that it becomes more of a restriction at high pressures.\n\nAs usual, the IEC effluent was collected\nThe precuts (solution prior to NH 4 0H\n\nthroughout column operation.\n\nbreakthrough) contained 11 percent of the original radioactivity indicating\nthat channeling in the IEC was very severe.\ncontained 65 percent of the radioactivity.\nfor radiotracer measurements,\n\nThe 7 milliliter prime cut\n\nAfter the sample was removed\n\nthe bulk of the prime cut was transferred\n\nto the derivatizer and the nominal derivatization process was carried out.\nThe product was evaporated onto a lab GC column.\n\nAs discussed in Sec-\n\ntion 3.2. 1.4, only a very large interference was seen in the gas chromatogram.\n\nIn light of the severe channeling of the IEC and other problems,\nthe recovery of 65 percent in the prime cut is not surprising. The total\nrecovery from the breadboard including pre and post cuts, and known\nlosses was 84 percent.\n\nNo soil was used in the test, instead 7 to 5 milli-\n\nliters of 6NHC1 containing the radiotracers was heated in the hydrolyzer\nfor the nominal 16 hours at 110 0 C. The remainder of the preprocessing\nwas carried out nominally.\n\nThe flow rate out of the evaporator through\n3-80\n\nthe IEC after HF/NH 4 OH processing was 0. 7 ml/min at 46 psig.\n\nWhen the\n\nfiltration of the liquid was finally complete at that pressure, and the gas\npenetrated the filter, the remaining liquid in the lines moved very rapidly,\nand it was not possible to prevent some gas from entering the IEC, again\ncausing channeling and somewhat reduced recovery in the 7 milliliter\nprime cut from the IEC elution (81.5 percent of the original radioactivity\nrecovered). The evaporation and derivatization was carried out in the\nlab.\n\nThe chromatogram (run on Carbowax ZOM) was relatively clean with\n\nboth the amino acid contamination and the interfering material peaks being\nat a low level (except for the trifluoro-acetamide peak) prior to the glutamic acid peaks.\n3. 2. 2. 2 End to End System Tests\nThe next test was designed as a complete end to end (hydrolyzer\nthrough derivatizer) test.\n\nBecause the quantity of amino acids in Waukena\n\nsoil (>200 nanomoles/cc for some amino acids) is sufficient to overload\nthe column, the Waukena soil was diluted with blank soil in a 25:75 ratio\nin order that the sample used would contain no more than approximately\n50 nanomoles of any given amino acid.\n\nThe one cubic centimeter of 25\n\npercent Waukena/75 percent blank was innoculated with 2 nanomoles each\nof 14C labeled alanine, proline, phenylalanine and glutamic acid to monitor the intermediate processing steps.\nThe quantity of NH 4 0H used in the HF/NH40H processing was\nchanged from 14 milliliters to 16 milliliters based on laboratory processing\nof blank soil samples which showed that an extra 2 milliliter of 4N NH 4 0H\nwas required to reach pH9 for the blank soil as compared to Waukena soil.\nThere were several hardware and procedural problems which occurred\nduring this test.\nAfter removal of 0. 25 inch of tubing from the end of the evaporator\nstandpipe, cleaning of the breadboard,\n\nrepacking and regeneration of the\n\nIEC, the final system test was carried out.\n\nThis test had two goals, one\n\nof which was to carry out another end to end system test, and the other\nwas to provide a sample processed from the hydrolyzer through the IEC\nto be derivatized with optically active 2-butanol for information on possible racemization effects in the breadboard processing.\n\nThe soil sample\n\nwas 1 cubic centimeter of Waukena soil innoculated with 2 nanomoles each\n3-81\n\nof the same 1C labeled amino acids as those used in the previous two\ntests.\n\nProcedural problems occurred which resulted in extra losses.\n\nThe hydrolysate evaporation process was erroneously started with the\nevaporator at too high a temperature which resulted in bumping when\nthe vent valve was opened.\n\nPost-test sampling of the vacuum system\n\ntraps revealed a 13 percent loss of radioactivity because of this problem.\nThe flow rate out of the evaporator through the IEC after the HF-NH40H\nprocessing was 0. 25 ml/min at 47 psig.\n\nThe spring on the S-6 valve\n\nsimulator (IEC inlet) caused difficulties during IEC operation.\n\nThe spring\n\nhad become corroded because of the general environment surrounding it.\nBecause of the spring, the valve did not operate reliably, and gas was\npushed through the IEC again. Eighteen percent of the radioactivity was\ncollected in the IEC effluent prior to NH 4 0H breakthrough.\nliter prime cut contained 54 percent of the radioactivity.\n\nThe 7 milliAfter collection\n\nand radiotracer sampling, the 7 milliliters were divided into two aliquots.\nTwenty-five percent of the sample was introduced into the derivatizer\nand a nominal derivatization carried out. As discussed in Section 3. 2. 1.4,\nthe chromatogram resulting from this derivatization again showed only a\nlarge interference.\n\nThe remaining 75 percent of the 7 milliliter IEC\nprime cut was derivatized in laboratory glassware using optically active\n(+)-2-butanaol/HC1.\n\nThe resulting chromatogram (Figure 3-29, upper)\n\nindicates that no significant racemization had occurred as a part of the\nbreadboard processing. Where measurable, the diastereomer ratios for\nthe test sample and for standard amino acids (Figure 3-29, lower) are\nequivalent.\n\n3-82\n\nti\ntl\n\nXtO-\n\n11\n\n{kr\n4411\nOWL\nX\n\nT\n\nF1\n\nTi\n\n1141\n\nOD\'\n\nri 00\n\nII;d\n\nyrj \'rf\nT\n\nft\n\n!1 IT\n\nIII I-i\n\nF\n\n+;II\n\nC,1\n\nll;i\n\nfit\n\ni i LI I t FT\nj\nI\n\nI\'t\n\nX\n\ni i\n\n: Ij\n\nii\n\nITILL\n\nIIn,\n\nLL\'\n\nII\n\nr:\n\ni~\n\n,,, t\n\nti\n\nrrrrrrrfZfli\nlf\ni\n\nT\n\nt~tir t\n\n+\n\nJjj\n\nI\n\n2\n\nWp!11\n1\n\nI A~\n\n~t~mt~trl\xc2\xb1\nm\nf-Httt\n-----\n\n4\n\n* nII\n\nfill\n\nw\n\nI\n\n111\xc2\xb1 ttl IA ttfflmt-lt\nf\ntII\n\nH,\n\n\'ill js4\n\n-1 11 1\n\ntit fill\n\nI0\n\nJlt4\niij\nM\nHill\n\nI4\n\n:\n\n.ll\n\n10\n\nAil\n\n.4.)\n\nm\n\nc\n\n0?:\n\n3. 3\n\nSUPPORTING LABORATORY STUDIES\nIn addition to the laboratory processing tests run as controls in\n\nparallel with breadboard tests,\nwas performed.\n\na variety of supporting laboratory work\n\nStandard procedures and methods were established,\n\nreagents purified, and material compatibility tests run.\n3. 3. 1 Soil Tests\nOf the soils provided by NASA/ARC/Waukena, Aiken, Hazen,\nDeath Valley, Volcanic Ash and blank), Waukena and the blank were used\nfor most of the lab testing and all of the breadboard testing.\nsoils except volcanic ash were all run at least once in the lab.\n\nThe other\nNo unusual\n\nproblems occurred with any of the soils although considerable variation\n(\xc2\xb12 milliliters) was found in the amount of 4N NH40H needed to achieve\nthe desired pH of 9 in the HF/NH40H processing.\n\nThe effect of soil\n\nvariability is expected to be much less with the baseline process,\n\nbut this\n\nneeds to be evaluated.\nEarlier in the program before the breadboard components were\nready for testing, lab processing tests were carried out to gain familiarity\nwith the Process No.\n\n1.

Approximately one million\ncpm total were added to each sample.\nThe labeled soil hydrolysates were evaporated to dryness, desalted,\nion-exchanged and derivatized in laboratory glassware along with appropriate controls: a system blank, an ion exchange blank, and a derivatization blank. Samples were taken for radiotracer counting at various points\nto follow amino acid losses.\n3-86\n\n10.0\n\n9.0\n\n8.0\n-\n\nWithout hydrolyzed soil\n\n---\n\nWith hydrolyzed soil\n\n00\n7.0\n\n6.\n\n5.\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n15\n\n16\n\nml 4 N NH40H\n\nFigure 3-30.\n\nTitration of 4 N NH 4 OH with 9 milliliters 5 N HF\n\n17\n\n18\n\nThe results of the radiotracer work are given in Table 3-7. Some\nvariation in recovery is seen for the two samples.\nThis is felt to result\nfrom handling losses rather than losses due to the ammonia reagent as\nthe\ndata compare with that obtained earlier using NaOH as a desalting reagent.\nThe chromatograms for this series of derivatives were run simultaneously on Carbowax and Dexsil columns to test a new Dexsil column\nand to collect background data on it while running under the same conditions as on the Carbowax column.\nThe two soil samples A and B gave nearly identical\nchromatograms,\nand no particular abnormalities were observed. On Dexsil, the\nmajor\ninterference peaks were beyond the amino acid peaks.\nThe interference\npeaks were not large, indicating that the system blank was improving.\nComparison with chromatograms from samples processed using\nNaOH to neutralize the HF showed no significant changes in either\namino\nacid appearance or impurity peak size or location. Thus, the change\nfrom NaOH to NH40OH in the precipitation step eliminated all\nreagent\ninjection problems in the evaporator by greatly minimizing\nthe difficulty\nin achieving the desired pH without causing any loss in performance\neither in amino acid recovery or in interfering material.\n3. 3. 2\n\nMaterial Testing\n\nMaterial tests were carried out as required throughout the program\nto determine which materials were most\nsuitable for cell construction,\nseals, valve components and filters.\n3. 3. 2. 1\n\nTantalum and Fansteel 63\n\nBased on preliminary compatibility testing which showed that\ntantalum was unaffected by the derivatization reagents, tantalum\nwas\nchosen as a candidate material for the derivatizer. Mixtures\ncontaining\nselected amino acids (at 10 micromole quantities) were derivatized\nusing existing reagents with or without tantalum foil present.\nSemiquantitative GC analysis gave peak heights within \xc2\xb110 percent\nfor the two\nsamples for valine, glycine, proline, methionine\nand phyenylalanine,\nwhich was within experimental error.\n\n3-88\n\nTable 3-7.\n\nRadiotracer Recoveries for Soil Desalted with Ammonia\nSample A\ncpm*\n\nHyd flask rinse\n\nSample B\n\nPercent Original Cts.\n\n9,070\n\ncpm*\n\nPercent Original Cts.\n\n3,400\n\nPrime filtrate\n\n1,222,480\n\nFiltrate rinse\n\n58,410\n\n44, 330\n\n3,290\n\n1,400\n\n92.8\n\n1,010,420\n\n102.9\n\nIon Exchange\nPre-cut\nPrime eluent\nPost cut\nco\n\n1,213, 730\n1,400\n\nTransferring losses\nAfter HC1/2-Butanol\n\n929,960\n\n90.8\n\n730\n-13. 2\n\n- 6.0\n\n"\n\n1,064,200\n\n77.2\n\n962,000\n\n93.9\n\n973,200\n\nAfter TFA\nDerivative\n\n88.0\n\n70.6\n\n1,016, 600\n\n99.2\n\n982,400\n\n71. 3\n\n871,400\n\n85. 1\n\nCorrected for background and for volume sampled.\nSample A labeled with proline 14C, glutamic acid 1 4 C, phenylalanine 14C, lysine 14C.\nTotal cpm 1,378,490.\nSample B labeled with alanine 14C, valine 14C, leucine 14C.

E. Pollock of ARC.\n*\n\nThe Fansteel dissolved completely.\n\n*\n\nThe tantalum corroded to a small fraction of initial size\nand lost all structural integrity.\n\n*\n\nThe Teflon containers for these experiments survived the\ntreatment but seemed to absorb some quantity of the\nsolution.\n\nThese results indicate that it would be impossible to hydrolyze with\nHF present using either of these materials.\n\nFurthermore, the degree of\n\nattack was so great that it is considered unlikely that HC1/HF could be\nevaporated from Fansteel or tantalum processing cells.\n\nThese results\n\ndo not contradict our earlier tests of tantalum with HF in the HF-NaOH\n(or HF-NH4 OH)processing step since the exposure time is very short and\nthe solution is cool.\n3. 3. 2. 2 Ion Exchange Column Spring\nA Teflon-coated spring for use in the ion exchange column was\ntested with solutions it would be exposed to in this configuration.\n\nThe\n\nsolutions showed no discoloration and the coated spring suffered no obvious\ndamage.\n\nThe spring was incorporated into the breadboard ion exchange\n\ncolumn.\n\n3-90\n\nAt the completion of the program, after more than 15 tests and\nregenerations,\n\nmany of which involved multiple acid/alkaline cycling,\nand more than 10 disassemblies and reassembly operations, the spring\nremained in excellent condition.\n3. 3. 2. 3 Seals and Valve Seat Materials\nViton E-60 and Creavey Seals:\nAt the first meeting with NASA/ARC,\n\na question was raised about\n\nthe compatibility of Viton E-60 which was proposed for use in the breadboard derivatizer and evaporator.\n\nTherefore, some brief tests were\n\ncarried out with several Viton E-60 O-rings and several O-ring seals of\nan alternate type known as Creavey seals.\n\nThe seals were refluxed with\n\n6N HC1 for 18 to 24 hours and then inspected.\n\nThe Viton seals, while not\n\nseriously affected, did become swollen and showed evidence of some\nsurface flaking.\n\nHowever, the Creavey seals, which consist of a stain-\n\nless steel spring sealed inside a Teflon (FEP) tube, (Sealol Co.,\nCity, California) were essentially unaffected.\n\nCulver\n\nThus the Creavey seals\n\nwere adopted in preference to Viton E-60 for exposure to hot HC1\ns olutions.\nViton E-60 was also the material selected initially for derivatizer\nvalve simulator body seals.\n\nIt was hoped that even if there were some\n\nmaterials problems with the Viton, the metal-to-metal contact surfaces\nbetween the cell contents and the seals would prevent any serious problems.\n\nApparently this was not the case and early derivatizer tests\n\n(described in Section 3.2.1.4) showed the Viton produced a large amount\nof interfering material.\nTherefore, the valve body seal was replaced with a Creavey seal.\nFurther testing of the derivatizer with Creavey seals present showed\nsome degradation of the seal with repeated use (especially the Creavey\nseal used between the derivatizer body and head end). After several\nderivatizations, the Creavey seal between the cell body and the head end\nwas found to have failed. The Teflon had taken a set and had cracked.\nUpon close examination, corrosion of the inner stainless steel spring was\nobserved. Previous tests with unstressed Creavey Seals had indicated\nthat they were reasonably compatible with the derivatization process.\n3-91\n\nHowever,\n\na test carried out with a stressed Creavey seal showed that\n\nthis seal also developed a set and cracked during the derivatization,\nleading to the conclusion that a replacement seals for the Creavey seals\nin the derivatizer were necessary.\n\nThis led to the development of an all\n\ntantalum/Teflon seal.\nFor hydrolyzer and evaporator use it had been observed that\nCreavey seals must be replaced after several tests. Thus, the tantalum/\nTeflon seals are probably desirable in these locations as well.\nEthylene Propylene Rubber:\nWhen problems with Viton in the derivatizer were first encountered,\nattempts were made to see if ethylene propylene rubber (EPR) would be\na more suitable material for the shaft seals on the initial valve simulators\nsince replacement of the valve shaft seals with a non-elastomeric type\nwould have been very difficult.\n\nPortions of Viton and EPR O-rings were\n\nput in derivatization vials and derivatizations carried out.\n\nThe O-ring\n\nmaterials were removed, the derivatization products were dissolved in\nCH 2 C1 2 , and small portions were chromatographed. A 0. 5 percent\ninjection of the sample from the derivatization in the presence of Viton\nresulted in a number of relatively large peaks; while in the case\nof EPR,\na 0. 5 percent injection was relatively clean. However, significant peaks\nwere observed from the EPR sample when 25 percent of the sample was\ninjected.\n\nThus EPR was a superior material, but it was not completely\n\ncertain that it could be successfully used for the shaft seal.\n\nTests were\nthen carried out with the derivatizer using EPR shaft seals in the valve\nsimulators to see if acceptable results could be obtained. However, as\ndiscussed in Section 3.2.1.4, the interference was still excessive. These\nresults lead to the fabrication of the all tantalum/Teflon valve simulators\ndescribed in Section 3. 2. 1. 6.\nEarlier in the program,\n\nsamples of the ethylene propylene\n\nterpolymer diaphragm material used in the VLBI "-4" configuration\nsolenoid valves were tested with some of the Wet Chemistry reagents.\n\n3-92\n\nSeparate samples were subjected to one of the following:\n1)\n\n6N HC1 overnight at 100 0 C\n\n2)\n\n2-butanol/HCl overnight at 100 0 C\n\n3)\n\nTFA/CH 2 C1 2 overnight at room temperature.\n\nIn each case, the initially colorless solutions turned various shades of\nyellow indicating that something was being extracted out of the diaphragms.\nThe diaphragms themselves changed color and swelled with the largest\nswelling having occurred in 6N HCL. This swelling is undesirable because\nit could prevent the valve from opening.\n\nThese tests indicated that the\n\nVLBI "-4" configuration solenoid valves would be unsatisfactory for use\nwith the Wet Chemistry reagents.\nOmniseal:\nOne of the candidate seals to replace the derivatizer main cell body\nseal was a type called an Omniseal (Aeroquipt Corp.,\n\nJackson, Michigan)\n\nwhich is a Teflon seal backed up with a stainless steel spring.\n\nThe Teflon\n\nis thicker in an Omniseal than in a Creavey seal so it was hoped that the\nOmniseal might have better performance.\n\nA derivatization test was\n\ncarried out in a small tantalum fixture sealed with an Omniseal.\nprimary test evaluation was the appearance of the seal.\n\nThe\n\nAt the end of the\n\ntest the stainless steel spring was somewhat discolored which indicated\nattack by the 2-butanol/HC1.\n\nTherefore, it was concluded that Omniseals\n\nprobably were unsatisfactory for use in the derivatizer.\n3.3. 2.4\n\nTeflon\n\nTeflon retains structural integrity upon repeated exposure to\nreagents used in the processing scheme, but it is known that materials\n(in particular, amino acids at trace levels) can be lost into the pores\nunder some conditions.\n\nUnder other conditions contaminant materials\n\nare released from the Teflon.\n\nFor these reasons, Teflon has not been a\n\ncandidate material for cell construction.\n\nIt has been used, however,\n\nfor filter material, gaskets and seals.\nSome problems have been experienced in its use as filter material.\nIn particular, the background impurity level has been high, even after\nsoxhlet extraction with 6N HC1.\n\n(Discussed in Section 3. 2. 2, system\n\nblank).\n3-93\n\nTests were run on Teflon rod and sheet to determine whether they\nwere responsible for unidentified peaks observed upon derivatizer heating\nto evaporate the sample onto the CG column.\n\nThe samples were first\n\nderivatized in reaction vials, then removed.\n\nMethylene chloride was\n\nadded to the vials to dissolve any residue and 25 percent of the solution\nwas injected into the GC column.\n\nThese showed no significant interfering\n\npeaks.\nThe Teflon samples were then heated while attached to a GC column,\nin a manner equivalent to derivatizer cell heating. Some baseline shift\nwas observed, but the magnitude of the broad baseline hump is considerably\nless than observed on soil processing runs, leading to conclusion that\nTeflon may not be the sole cause of the interfering material seen in most\nof the derivatizations of pure amino acids in the derivatizer,\n\nor that the\n\ninterfering material may decompose on standing while exposed to air.\n3. 3. 2. 5\n\nFilter and Filtration Tests\n\nFiltration out of the hydrolyzer and evaporator presented two problem areas; first that of the impurities released by the Teflon filters; and\nsecond, that of clogging or leaking created by inadequate arrangement of\nthe filter stack.\n\nFor these reasons, a variety of filtration tests were run,\nboth to find appropriate filter stack arrangement, and to find possible substitute material.\nTests were then run on the following filter arrangements by filtering a mixed solution of water, HF and NH 4 through filters placed in the\nevaporator:\n1)\n\n2 perforated Teflon plates bonded to porous backup\nmaterial. 2 millipore Teflon filters (5 L, 10 L) previously extracted in 6N HC1.

By combining\nradiotracer tests with GC analysis, independently analyzable data was\nobtained. Furthermore, the use of radiotracers allowed the separation\nof amino acid recovery problems from derivatization and GC analysis\nproblems. It was felt to be unnecessary to carry out radiotracer studies\nwith all of the required amino acid types. Two standard amino acid mixtures were developed to accomplish radiotracer testing in an efficient\nmanner.\n3. 3. 3. 1 Handling Techniques\nInitial radiotracer work was done to establish both efficiency and\nreproducibility of our laboratory procedures. A variety of transferring\nand measuring devices were tested to determine the most reproducible\nmethod of handling small quantities of radioactive solutions in conjunction\nwith thin layer chromatography.\n\nThe microliter-syringe was the\nmeasuring device selected as most accurate and convenient.\nThe scintillation cocktail selected was 12 milliliters New England\nNuclear Aquasol plus 4 milliliters 0. 1 N HC1. The amino acid, plain or\nabsorbed onto cellulose (in the case of thin layer chromatography), was\nfirst dissolved in the aqueous HLc, then Aquasol was added, and the cocktail shaken to gel, which provided a homogeneous reproducible counting\nmedium.\n\n3-96\n\nTwo standard mixtures of labeled amino acids were established:\nMixture 1 -\n\nGlutamic acid\n\nMixture 2 - Alanine\n\nLysine\n\nLeucine\n\nPhenylalanine\n\nValine\n\nProline\nThe first mixture provided a variety of amino acid types: acidic,\nbasic, aromatic, and imino. The second mixture provided three wellbehaved but volatile components.\n\nIn addition, thin layer chromatographic\n\ntechniques were developed to permit the isolation of each individual\namino acid in the mixture.\n\nThus, if unexplained losses occurred, it was\n\npossible to identify which amino acids were lost.\nThese radiotracers could be added at any point in a processing\ntest, and could be sampled at any point.\n3. 3. 3. 2\n\nThin Layer Chromatography\n\nThin Layer Chromatography was selected as a method to separate\namino acids in the radiotracer mixture when necessary to pinpoint specific\nlosses and to establish the purity of our radiotracer compounds.\nAnaltech 100-micron Avicel microcrystalline cellulose plates\nwere used for this work.\nIdentification was accomplished with autoradiography using Kodak\nX-ray film (no screen), as this is non-destructive identification allowing\nlater scraping off of the cellulose and counting the radioactivity for\nquantitative recovery information.\nInitial work with glutamic acid on TRW plates showed a recovery\nof about 80 percent glutamic acid from the cellulose. Cellulose added\nto the three references resulted in a 1 percent decrease in counts, indicating that it was not the cellulose itself that was significantly interfering\nwith the counts.\n\nThe plates from which the cellulose squares had been\nscraped were washed with H2O and 0. 1 N HC1 and the wash water was\n\ncounted to demonstrate that no significant losses occurred in the scraping\nprocess.\n\n3-97\n\nFurther tests with glutamic acid spotted on cellulose were made in\norder to discover a means for recovering a greater percentage of the\namino acid with the following results:\n1)\n\nAdding unlabeled amino acid or 0. 1 N NaOH to the cellulose\nbefore spotting with labeled amino acid increased the\nrecovery from the cellulose.\n\n2)\n\nSolvent (i. e., HZO) was required in order to both better\ndissolve the amino acid and to form a gel when Aquasol\nwas added, so that the cellulose and amino acid would not\nall settle to the bottom of the vial. When one milliliter of\nAquasol was added to the sample of cellulose in the vial\nbefore water had been added, a 20 to 30 percent count\nreduction resulted.\n\nIn later tests with Avicel plates,\n\nreproducible measurements were\n\nachieved, and in each sample vial a gel was formed of 4 milliliters of\naqueous solution and 12 milliliters of Aquasol.\n\nThe results with all three\n\nlabeled amino acids showed good recovery from the cellulose after it was\nsimply spotted with the amino acid,\n\nscraped into the counting vial, dis-\n\nsolved in a solvent and made into a gel.\n\nLoss of counts was seldom\n\ngreater than 2 percent.\nIncluded in these recovery tests was an investigation into which\nsolvent of three:\n\nHZO, 0. 1 N HC1, or 0. 1 N NaOH, best extracted the\n\namino acids from the cellulose.\n\nNaOH was not satisfactory because it\n\nhad a significant quenching effect.\n\nBoth H 2 0 and HC1 gave good results,\nand it was decided to use 0. 1 N HC1 in subsequent tests.\nTwo TLC solvent systems were tried:\n\n1)\n\nButanol/acetic acid/water:\n\n2)\n\nChloroform/methanol/1 7% ammonia: 40/40/20\n\n60/20/20\n\nBetter separations were obtained with system 1, and it was used\nfor subsequent TLC work.\n\nUsing pure, unlabeled amino acids, adequate\n\none dimensional separations were obtained for lysine,\nproline and phenylalanine.\n\n3-98\n\nglutamic acid,\n\n3. 3. 3. 3\n\nTrapping Tests\n\nSome tests of trapping techniques were carried out to evaluate\nmethods of trapping radiotracer labeled derivatives so as to have a\nmethod of monitoring the derivatizer in addition to gas chromatography.\nThese tests were conducted by connecting traps of various types\nand configurations to a heated injection port of a gas chromatograph.\nWith carrier gas flow in the usual range, the radiotracer labeled amino\nacids were injected, and after a period of carrier gas flow, the traps\nwere disconnected, washed with solvent (usually toluene) and the solutions counted.\n\nVarious trapping temperatures used included room tem-\n\nperature, ice bath, and liquid nitrogen temperatures.\nwere not satisfactory.\n\nThe recoveries\n\nIt appears that traps using a GC liquid phase may\n\nbe necessary to get adequate recovery although these may be difficult to\nwash out.\nAn alternate method would be to combust the derivatives to CO\nreactor and quantitatively trap the 14CO 2 in hyamine hydroxide for\ncounting.\n\nOne test of this concept was carried out.\n\nin a\n\n2\n\nAn old laboratory\n\nversion of the copper/firebrick organic vapor trap (OVT) used in the\nViking pyrolytic release experiment was used to oxidize the derivatives.\nThe OVT was used in both trapping/oxidation and straight oxidation modes.\nBoth He and 02 were used as carrier gases. The amount of radioactivity\ncollected in the hyamine hydroxide trap ranged from 20 to 80 percent, and\nthe results were not consistent in replicate experiments.\n\nTherefore, it\nwas concluded that a more efficient oxidizing unit would be required if\nthese experiments were to be pursued further. No further oxidation type\ntrapping tests were carried out.\nThus,\n\nthe nominal method of evaporating the derivatives onto a GC\ncolumn and running a gas chromatogram was the only method used to\nmonitor the derivatizer with the exception of post mortem cell washing\nto measure the amount of sample remaining in the derivatizer.\n3.3.4 Reagents\nIn order to evaluate reagent purity status, various reagent blanks\nwere run with existing reagents.\nThe intent was to place the initial\npurification emphasis on those reagents which had the worst blanks.\n3-99\n\nThe\n\nion exchange resin was the most significant contributor to GC impurity\npeaks initially, but improvements were made throughout the program.\n3. 3. 4. 1 Ion Exchange Resin\nIon exchange resin was cleaned according to the following\nprocedure:\n\na large chromatography column with a coarse porosity glass\nAbout one-half\n\nfrit was set up with heating tape attached to a Variac.\n\npound Biorad AG50W X8 (200 - 400 mesh) in a slurry of 0. 1 N HC1 was\nThe following\n\npoured into the column and allowed to soak overnight.\n\nreagents were then washed through at 500C as received (except Arrowhead distilled water redistilled in glass before use):\nwater to neutrality,\nwater to neutrality.\n\n4N HCl,\n\nwater to neutrality,\n\nwater, 2N NaOH,\n\n50% glacial acetic acid,\n\nThe resin was then soxhlet extracted with methanol\n\nfor 1 hour and dried under vacuum overnight.\nFollowing initial purification the same resin was reused throughout\nthe program with normal processing reagent recycling between uses.\nappears that impurities occur on standing,\n\nIt\n\nand that recycling prior to\n\nuses provides a cleaner sample.\nAt the end of the program the only major interference peak occurring\nwas that ascribed to trifluoroacetamide.\n3. 3. 4. 2\n\nOther Reagents\n\nThe following was the final status of reagent purification:\nHC1, aqueous - Mallinckrodt Reagent diluted to constant boiling\nmixture and distilled in all glass system\nHC1, anhydrous\n\n- Air Products,\n\nelectronic grade\n\nHydrofluoric acid - Baker Reagent\nAmmonium hydroxide - Baker Reagent\n2-butanol (racemic) - Baker grade\n(+)-2-butanol (optically active) - Norse Laboratories\nThe 2-butanol was purified before use by decanting from\nmolecular sieve and distilling from 2, 4-dinitrophenylhydrazine\nand sodium sulfate.\nMethylene chloride - Mallinckrodt Nanograde\n\n3-100\n\nTrifluoroacetic anhydride - PCR, Inc. Distilled before use in\nglass system.\nH 2 0 - Redistilled arrowhead distilled water in all glass system.\n2-butanol/HCl - prepared in all glass system by bubbling\nanhydrous HC1 through concentrated H 2 S0 4 then through butanol\nprotected from air by butanol plus NaOH pellets and an Aquasorb\noutlet tube.\nA long-term storage test was carried out on several samples of\nracemic 2-butanol/HC1 to determine if interfering materials were produced\non standing (the low rate of racemization of 2-butanol/HC1 on long term\nstorage at room temperature was demonstrated in the previous study).\nThe butanol/HC1 was stored in sealed glass ampoules to prevent exposure\nto air and water and thus more closely modeled storage in the flight\ninstrument.\n\nAfter 8 months, the ampoules were opened and derivatization\n\nblanks were prepared and chromatographed.\n\nThe chromatograms were not\n\nsignificantly different from the ones obtained with samples for the same\nbutanol/HCl batch before it was sealed into the ampoules.\n\nSome peaks\n\nwere present in both sets of chromatograms since our early 2-butanol/\nHCI reagent was not as well purified and produced as later reagent was.\nThe key point is the fact that neither the number nor the size of the peaks\nsignificantly increased.\n\nThus it appears that 2-butanol/HC1 is\n\nstable in\n\nterms of interference production as well as in terms of racemization, and\nit should last through a nominal 90-day mission.\n3. 3. 5\n\nGas Chromatography\nTwo commercial gas chromatographs with flame ionization\n\ndetectors were used on this program:\nA mixture of 60/40 He/H\n\n2\n\na Varian 1800 and a Varian 1527.\n\nwas used as carrier gas, plus an additional\n\nquantity added as volume make-up at the detector.\nEarly in the program it had been decided on consultation with NASA/\nARC that Carbowax 20M would be used as the primary column, so our old\nCarbowax 20M columns were briefly reconditioned and tested.\n\nQualita-\n\ntively, there did not appear to have been any degradation of the columns\nduring 18 months of storage without any special precautions.\n\nThe resolu-\n\ntion of diastereomeric pairs remained excellent for most of the common\namino acids, and the sensitivity was good.\n\n3-101\n\nWhile the storage life of these columns is expected to be good, it\nis important to confirm this fact prior to spacecraft usage.\nSeveral Carbowax 20 M and Dexsil 400 columns were prepared\nduring the program.\n\nFor the 200 foot, 0. 030-inch ID columns, 65 to 75\n\nmilligrams Carbowax was appropriate.\n\nSince the columns were generally\n\nused for analytical purposes only, conditions (temperature programming\nrate, carrier gas flow) were not optimized to establish maximum resolution per coating weight.\nThe Dexsil Columns were coated with 78 to 85 milligrams material.\nThe Dexsil columns did not have a long life under the conditions that they\nwere used.\n\nThis is apparently caused by damage of the coating in the\n\ncolumn inlet by injection of large volumes of methylene chloride (50\nmicroliters sample injections were frequently used).\n\nThese Dexsil col-\n\numns also appeared to tail excessively with small quantities of amino\nacids.\n\nGood peaks were obtained with quantities greater than 10 nanomoles\n\nand fair to good peaks with 2.5 nanomoles.\nor less are not well shaped.\n\nHowever peaks of 1 nanomole\n\nThis effect did not occur with Carbowax 20M.\n\nBecause different results were obtained.for the ion exchange column\nblank with Carbowax 20M and Dexsil 400, an attempt was made to\nreactivate an old Poly A-101A column to see what results would be obtained\nfor a third liquid phase. However, the old column had degraded badly and\nwas not worth using.\n6\n\nA fresh Poly A-101A column was prepared using a\n\n6-milligrams coating which may have been slightly light.\n\nWhile this\n\ncolumn does not resolve amino acids as well as Carbowax, it is useful as\nan alternative type column because impurity peaks are shifted to other\nlocations.\n\nThe peak ascribed to trifluoroacetamide occurs beyond the\n\namino acid range.\n\n3-102\n\n4.\n\nFLIGHT DESIGN UPDATE\n\n4. 1 SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS AND INSTRUMENT SYSTEM DEFINITION\nThe Automated Wet Chemistry Instrument is\n\nrequired to analyze at\n\nleast three soil samples for optically active amino acids under the condi-\n\ntions specified in NASA/ARC Specification A-16231, Revision 3, Automated Wet Chemistry Instrument for Landed Planetary Missions.\n\nA list\n\nof mandatory and desirable amino acids the instrument shall be capable\n\nof analyzing as well as the basic sequence for accomplishing the analyses,\nincluding types and amounts of reagents, order of addition, and processing times and temperatures are also defined in Specification A-16231.\nPerformance requirements such as resolution and separation of and\nsensitivity to amino acids, and internal calibration requirements are\nalso specified in the document.\n\nPortions of the specification are\n\nincluded in Table 4-1 for reference.\nThe processing sequence contains the following basic operations:\ninternal calibration, soil handling, amino acid extraction, hydrolysis,\npurification, derivitization and gas chromatographic analysis.\n\nThe\n\ncomponents necessary to perform these operations are:\n* Soil distributor for soil handling\n*\n\nExtractor cell for amino acid extraction\n\n*\n\nHydrolyzer/Evaporator cell for hydrolysis and then HC1 evaporation\n\ne\n\nIon exchange column for desalting\n\n*\n\nDerivatizer cell for derivitization of the amino acids\n\n*\n\nGas Chromatographic Column and detector for gas\nchromatographic analysis.\n\n4-1\n\nTable 4-1.\n\nAnalysis Requirements (From Specification\nA-16231, R ev. 3)\n\nAnalysis Sequence:\nStep 1.\n\nPlace a 1 cubic centimeter soil sample in a chamber\n\nStep 2.\n\nAdd 10 milliliters of water.\n\nStep 3.\n\nHeat to 165 5 0 C for 1 hour.\n\nStep 4.\n\nAllow to cool and filter off the insoluble soil residue.\n\nStep 5.\n\nAdd 10 milliliter of 6N HC1 to the filtrate from Step 4.\n\nStep 6.\n\nHeat solution to 110 0 C for 5 hours.\n\nStep 7.\n\nEvaporate to dryness.\n\nNOTE:\n\nThe following step is performed on the ion exchange column\nprior to proceeding to Step 9.

The derivatizer, in addition, is connected via\na heatpipe to a thermoelectric cooler to maintain the cell temperature\nbelow 100C during evaporation of solvents after amino acid derivitization.\nThe ion exchange column has gas actuated isolation valves at inlet and\noutlet to preclude drying of the resin during interplanetary cruise.\nThe instrument contains a single capillary tube self-heated gas\nchromatographic column which is used, in the baseline configuration,\nin conjunction with a flame ionization detector. The use of a state-of-theart electron capture detector or the addition of a mass spectrometer is\nalso under consideration. The stainless steel column is used as a\nresistance element heater and is designed to provide uniform column\ntemperatures during steady state and programmed temperature control.\nActive temperature control is maintained by sensing the change in column\nelectrical resistance as the column is heated. The column inlet and outlet are close coupled to the derivatizer outlet and detector, respectively.\nThe amino acids are injected directly into the column from the derivatizer.\nCold trapping of amino acid derivatives is provided by the column liquid\nphase.\nThe baseline instrument contains a single flame ionization detector.\nThe detector has inlets for the He/H 2 carrier gas from the gas chromatographic column, makeup He/H\n\n2\n\ngas, and 02 gas.\n\nA single outlet is\n\nprovided with a gas actuated valve and flow restrictor. The detector has\na separate heater and temperature sensor to maintain the detector temperature at a constant value, slightly above the maximum programmed\ngas chromatographic column temperature.\nTwo gas supplies are used in the instrument. One provides oxygen\nfor the flame ionization detector. For long term storage, the oxygen\nsupply is isolated by a thermally actuated isolation valve which is actuated\nat the start of the experiment. A control valve is used to turn the gaseous\noxygen on and off as required.\nA second gas supply contains a mixture of helium and hydrogen\n(approximately 44 percent H 2 by volume). This system has three branches.\nThe first branch is connected downstream bf the first pressure regulator\n(approximately 165 psia) and is used to pressurize the gas actuated isolation valves on all reagent containers and on the ion exchange column. It\n4-8\n\nwill also be used for all gas actuated tantalum diaphragm valves (control\nvalves) in the instrument, and for the gas actuated extractor cover.\n\nThe\n\nother two branches are connected downstream of the second stage regulator (18 psia); one branch supplies carrier gas through the gas chromatographic column and then through the flame ionization detector.\neach of these branches is controlled by a separate valve.\n\nGas from\n\nLow pressure\n\ngas is also used for pressurization of the various cells, for purging and\ngas drying, and for fluid routing and reagent injection.\n\nThe gas supply\n\nis sealed with a thermally actuated isolation valve for long term storage.\nIdentical reagent storage containers and injectors are used in the\ncurrent design.\n\nThe reagents are stored in compatible metallic containers\n\nand a gas actuated isolation valve is used to seal the container for long\nterm storage.\n\nAfter actuation the flow of the reagent is maintained by\n\nthe low pressure He/H\n\n2\n\ngas, and the amount of reagent delivered to the\n\ncell is determined by the open time of the control valve of the outlet.\nBecause of shelf life limitations, the 2-butanol and anhydrous HC1\nare stored separately.\n\nThe anhydrous HC1 is stored in a small pressure\n\nvessel at approximately 900 psi.\nhelium gas.\n\nTen percent of this volume contains\n\nThe 2-butanol is stored in a separate container under its own\n\nvapor pressure.\n\nThe two vessels are isolated from each other and from\n\nthe rest of the system by gas actuated isolation valves.\n\nUpon actuation\n\nof the valve between the two vessels, the HC1 gas and 2-butanol in the\nadjacent reservoir are allowed to react.\n\nThe inert helium is used as the\n\ndriving pressure (blowdown mode) for reagent injection.\n\nInjection is\n\naccomplished by first opening the gas actuated isolation valve downstream\nof the 2-butanol reservoir and then opening the control valve for a predetermined time to meter the mixture to the derivatizer.\nSince this injector operates in a blowdown mode, the time required\nto inject equal volumes into the derivatizer in subsequent analysis sequences will vary with successive injections.\n\nThis characteristic is\n\nrepeatable and can be accommodated in the electronics by changing the\nvalve open time for each application.\nThe instrument contains two vent systems internal to the package\n(as compared to three previously). These are connected to a single outlet vent for interfacing with the Lander.\n4-9\n\nA common vent manifold is used\n\nfor the extractor, hydrolyzer/ evaporator, derivatizer, and ion exchange\ncolumn. Valves at the outlets of these cells prevent backflow and cross\ncontamination between cells.\n\nThe second vent system is used on the outlet\n\nof the gas chromatographic column and flame ionization detector and for\nthe two gas supply systems.\nControl and routing of reagents, gases and samples are accomplished\nwith a fluid system consisting of small diameter tubing and gas actuated\ncontrol and isolation valves. The plumbing system is designed to contain\na minimum number of valves and to prevent cross contamination between\nvarious cells. Two and three way solenoid valves, most thermally actuated isolation valves and (passive) check valves incorporated in the previous design have been eliminated and/or replaced.\nThe electronic subsystem provides the regulated power, instrument\ncontrol functions and data processing. This subsystem receives, decodes\nand distributes commands from the Lander.\n4. 1. 1 Instrument Analysis Capabilities\nThe following paragraphs contain discussions on the analysis capabilities of the instrument as compared to the specification requirements\nfor Process No. 2. The items covered are soil sample size, carrier gas\ncomposition, number of amino acids detectable,\n\ngas chromatographic\n\ncolumn resolution and separation, column temperature control, column\nretention time, overall system sensitivity and detector dynamic range,\npeak area integration accuracy, optically active resolving agent, and\ninternal calibration.\n\nA summary of the specification requirements is\n\nincluded in Table 4-1.\nWe believe the instrument is capable of satisfying the specification\nrequirements.\nThe separation and resolution of all of the amino acids on the mandatory list have not yet been demonstrated but columns are available which\nshould provide adequate separation and resolution. While the detector\nsensitivity is better than required, the overall sensitivity is determined\nby interference, and further reduction of the amount of interference is\n\n4-10\n\nneeded to obtain sensitivities below 1 nanomole.\n\nIt is felt that the inter-\n\nference can be reduced sufficiently to reach the 0. 1 nanomole requirement.\n4. 1. 1. 1 Soil Sample Size\nThe soil distribution subsystem meters soil volumetrically.\n\nA\n\nmetering cavity size of 1.0 cubic centimeter was selected for the instrument design.\n\nBased upon the Viking Program Mars Engineering Model,\nthe density of Martian soil varies from 1. 0 g/cm 3 (Loess) to 3. 2 g/cm 3\n(rock).\n\nFor design purposes, a soil density of 1. 5 g/cm 3 was selected\n\nand the reagent injector volumes were sized accordingly.\nFor a given system detection sensitivity, increasing the soil sample\nsize will provide some increase in the capability to analyze lower amino\nacid concentrations.\n\nThis is not necessarily a linear relationship for all\n\nof the amino acids because the amount of interfering species may also\nincrease.\n\nFrom this standpoint, the optimum soil sample size has not\n\nbeen determined.\nUsing the analytical sequence of Process No. 2, increasing the soil\nsample size has the following impact on the system. The H 2 0O volume for\nextraction probably would increase linearly with soil sample size as would\nthe amount of HC1 solution required for hydrolysis.\nSome increase in ion exchange resin volume would be required.\nThe volume of the reagents associated with the ion exchange column\nwould increase linearly with resin volume.\n4. 1. 1. 2\n\nCarrier Gas\n\nThe specification requirement for the carrier gas is to be determined. The instrument, as currently designed, uses a mixture of helium\nand hydrogen (56 percent He, 44 percent H 2 ). The helium and hydrogen\ngases are mixed together and stored in a single tank and are used for\npressurization, mixing, purging, gas chromatographic column carrier\ngas and flame ionization detector operation.\n\nThe reason for combining\n\nthe gases was to minimize the number of gas supply subsystems.\ntory tests continue to verify the validity of this approach.\n\nLabora-\n\nOther carrier gases could be used if a different detector type were\ndesired, or if the experiment was operated in conjunction with a mass\nspectrometer.\n4-11\n\nColumn Performance\n\n4. 1. 1.3\n\nIdentification.\n\nThe requirements for amino acid identification by\n\nretention time and for retention time precision can be satisfied with the\ncolumns evaluated.\nThe retention time precision for each amino acid is\nwithin 0. 5 percent.\n\nrequired to be\n\nNormally, variations in the column temperature pro-\n\nfile are the most significant variable affecting retention time.\n\nHowever,\n\nin this instrument, the column temperature profile is closely controlled\n(within \xc2\xb10. 5 0 C) and should not be a large source of retention time\nvariation.\nThe other significant variable with respect to the retention time in\nthis instrument is the carrier gas flow rate.\n\nThe current design uses a\n\ncarrier gas supply system which is basically the same as that used for\nViking Lander Biology Instrument.\n\nWith this system the flow can vary\n\nas much as 2. 2 percent because of variations in regulator pressure.\n\nThe\n\neffect of flow rate on retention time depends on column operating paramAt constant temperature,\n\neters.\n\nthe retention time varies approximately\n\nas the square root of the flow rate (i. e.,\n\n2. 2 percent flow variation equi-\n\nvalent to a 1. 1 percent variation in retention time).\nis temperature programmed,\ntime is\n\nreduced.\n\nThus,\n\nFor a column which\n\nthe effect of flow variations on retention\n\n2. 2 percent flow variation will result in a signi-\n\nficantly smaller variation in retention time.\n\nFurthermore,\n\nsome of the\n\npressure variation is caused by temperature changes at the regulator.\nThese effects can be corrected for in the returned data by use of temperature measurements and the calibration of the regulator pressure/\ntemperature dependence.\n\nIf further development testing shows that the\n\nfluctuation of retention time is greater than desired,\n\nadditional flow control\n\nis feasible.\nThe nature of the column can also affect the retention time precision\nbecause of aging effects.\n\nThe retention times obtained for a given column\n\nvaries over the life of the column.\noperating cycles is\nlife.\n\nHowever, the effect over several\n\nsmall as long as the column is not near the end of its\n\nRetention time precision of 0. 5 percent is achieved in the laboratory\n\nif care is taken to maintain reproducible operating conditions.\n\n4-12\n\nGeneral column testing was, not carried\nout as a part of this program and all of the amino acids in the new mandatory list were not run. Based on column tests in the previous program and\nResolution and Separation.\n\non results from NASA/ARC,\n\ncolumns are available which can meet most\n\nif not all resolution and separation requirements of the specification.\nHowever, it is recognized that the possibility that the column most suited\nto the overall mission goals might not meet the separation and resolution\nrequirements in their entirety. Selection of the GC column to be used in\nthe instrument should await further instrument development.\nColumn Temperature.\n\nThe temperature programming will be con-\n\n0\ntrolled so that at any time, the actual temperature will be within \xc2\xb10. 5 C.\nof the nominal temperature for that point on the time-temperature profile.\n\nThe temperature readout will provide the requirement \xc2\xb10. 50C accuracy.\n4.1.1.4 Detector\nSensitivity.\n\nThe overall sensitivity requirement for the total instru-\n\nment after data processing is that between 0. 1 and 50 nanomoles of each\nof the amino acids on the mandatory list can be detected. The design goal\nis to be able to detect 0. 01 nanomole or less of each amino acid in the soil\nsample. Laboratory studies indicate that the gas chromatographic column\ndetector system is capable of providing the required sensitivity.\n\nBased on\n\nthe data obtained with a conventional laboratory gas chromatograph from\nsamples in the 2 nanomole range and extrapolating a 2:1 signal-to-noise\nratio for an amino acid 100 percent in one enantiomer, 0. 005 to 0. 05 nanomole of the mandatory amino acids should be detectable (in the absence of\nconflicts) depending on the column, column operating conditions and the\nparticular amino acid.\nThe major uncertainties in estimating the total overall sensitivity\nlies in the recovery of the amino acids in the soil, and in the amount of\ninterferences present in the gas chromatogram. The recovery is influenced\nby the extraction efficiency, the amount of amino acid breakdown during\nhydrolysis, losses during ion exchange desalting, and the derivatization\nefficiency.\n\nThe extraction efficiency depends upon the nature of the soil\n\nsample and the degree of polymerization of the amino acids. Extraction\nefficiency is high for abiologic samples, but for life derived samples, the\nefficiency may be lower.\n\nBased on breadboard test results extrapolated\n4-13\n\nto Process No. 2, the recovery in the rest of the processing is expected\nto be high (85 to 90 percent) and the derivatization efficiency is expected\nto be good (85 to 90 percent average).\n\nBased on NASA/ARC information,\n\nthe extraction efficiency should be adequate so that less than 0. 1 nanomole\ncan be detected.\nThe sensitivity with the current breadboard with Process No. 1 is\nlimited by the presence of interferences in the gas chromatogram.\n\nThe\n\nchange to process should lead to the reduction or elimination of most of\nthe interference problems.\n\nKnown solutions are available for the remain-\n\ning interference problems.\n\nThus, it is felt that the 0. 1 nanomole require-\n\nment can be satisfied.\nDynamic Range.\nis six decades.\n\nThe dynamic range requirement for the detector\n\nOne percent area integration accuracy must be maintained\n\nin each decade over this entire range. This requirement means, first,\nthat the detector must handle signals over this range with reasonable\nlinearity, and its operating parameters must be adequately controlled.\nThe suitability of the ATC HYFID design for this requirement has been\ndemonstrated by its incorporation in an organic analysis system covering\nseven decades of linear range (NASA/ARC Contract NAS 2-5469).\nSecondly, the detector electrometer must be range-switched to\nprevent overload and guarantee correct utilization of the analog/digital\n(A/D) converter to maintain the 1 percent area integration accuracy in\neach decade of range. (For example, a 10-bit A/D converter has a\nresolution of only one part in 1024 and cannot be used to cover the entire\nsix decades of range.) Low level:-signal conditioning, A/D conversion\nand data formatting are discussed in Section 4.4. 7.\nAccuracy.\n\nThe entire chromatogram will be sent back in a manner\nbasically identical to that used to send back the entire chromatogram from\nthe gas exchange experiment of the Viking Lander Biology Instrument.\nThe concepts involved in reconstruction of the chromatogram were discussed in the final report on the previous program (NASA/ARC Contract NAS 2-6218). These concepts have been proven by reconstruction\nof actual digitalized chromatograms from VLBI development instruments.\n\n4-14\n\nThe basic difference between the wet chemistry and the VLBI chromatograms\nis the greater dynamic range with the wet chemistry instrument which will\nrequire additional range switching before the A/D converter, and the\nincreased length of the chromatogram.\n\nThere is also a greater variability\n\nin peak shapes in the wet chemistry instrument if column overloading\noccurs, and some column bleed is present at the upper end of the temperature program.\n\nHowever, the analysis of these factors performed in the\n\nprevious program indicates that the reconstruction process is not significantly affected.\n\nThus the entire chromatogram will be available with\n\nbetter than 1 percent accuracy, and hence the best ground based integration methods can be applied to the reconstructed chromatogram which\nshould allow peak area accuracy to be better than the specified 1 percent.\n4. 1. 1.5\n\nOptically Active Resolving Agent\n\nThe (+) 2-butanol shall consist of 90/10 ratio of the enantiomorphic\npairs as specified.\n\nIn order to preserve the optical purity of the 2-butanol\n\nduring terminal sterilization and storage, the 2-butanol/HC1 reagent will\nbe made after landing from 2-butanol and anhydrous HC1.\n4.1.1.6\n\nInternal Calibration\n\nA mixture of two racemic amino acids or peptides are to be included\nin the instrument for calibration.\n\nThey will be added as an aqueous solu-\n\ntion to the extractor after loading of soil and before the start of the\nextraction.\n4. 1.2\n\nOperating Sequence\nA step-by-step operating sequence has been developed for the instru-\n\nment system.\n\nThis sequence contains the basic functions for analysis of a\n\nsingle soil sample.\n\nAdditional functions are required to open the isolation\n\nvalves for the gas supplies and H 2 0,\n\nNH 4 0H and 2-butanol/HCl injectors\n\nthe first time the instrument is operated.\nThe operating sequence is described in the following paragraphs.\nThis sequence is for a Lander thermal plate temperature of -15\n\n0\n\nF.\n\nThe\n\nsequence will vary slightly as a function of Lander plate temperature\nbecause of differences in heat-up and cool-down times.\n\nThe -15\n\n0\n\nF condi-\n\ntion is a worst case from a power standpoint (longer heat-up times, higher\n\n4-15\n\nthermal losses).\n\nTable 4-2 contains a listing of the sequence steps, the\n\noperating time requirements for each step, and valve and heater actuation\nrequirements.\nThe following paragraphs describe the processing steps listed in\nTable 4-2.\n1)\n\nActivate Instrument\nAn initiation sequence is performed prior to the first analysis\nto actuate the thermal isolation valves for the gas supply systems: He/H 2 (TIV-1) and 02 (TIV-2). Line heaters H-12 and\nH13 and the He/H2 supply heater, H-15 are also turned on at\nthis time.\n\n2)\n\nReceive Soil from Lander\nOperation of the instrument begins on receipt of the initiate\ncommand and electrical power from the Lander. This command is to be generated after the Lander has deposited the\nsoil sample into the instrument soil feed tube. (Any mechanical processing, such as crushing of soil, is carried out by\nthe Lander.) The command starts the automatic sequence for\nprocessing the first sample through processing cells.\n\n3)\n\nTransfer Soil Sample into Extractor\nSoil from the Lander soil processor is transferred through\nthe soil feed tube into the soil distributor assembly where it\nis metered and dumped into the extractor. This operation is\ndescribed in more detail in Section 4. 3. 1.\n\n4)\n\nHeat Extractor\nTo prepare the sample for processing, the extractor is\nheated to 100C. Since the minimum specification temperature of -320C (-25 0 F) could cause freezing of any of the\nreagent solution to be injected into the processing cells, all\nreagent containers are heated in preparation for the next\nstep at this time by turning on heaters H-7 through H-11.\n\n5)\n\nOpen Gas Actuated Isolation Valves\nTo prevent loss or contamination prior to launch and in flight,\nall reagents are stored in sealed containers, which are\nopened prior to use with high pressure He/H 2 by opening S-1\nand S-2 to operate the gas actuated isolation valves on the\nreagent containers. After the isolation valves have been\nopened, excess gas pressure is vented through S-34. The\ninjectors are heated during this process so the reagents will\nbe liquid when the disks are punctured.\n\n4-16\n\nEvent No.\nEvent No.\n\nTime To\nNext Step\n\nElapsed\nTime\n\n1\n\nEvent and Steps\nEvent and Steps\n\nHeaters\n\nValves\n\n1\n\nActivate Instrument\n\ni.\n\na.

CL S-4 represents the opening of the pilot\nand master vent solenoid valves, followed shortly thereafter by their closure.\n\n6)\n\nInject Standard Amino Acids Into the Extractor\nPrior to the extraction step, standard amino acids (TBD) are\ninjected onto the soil to provide an internal reference.\nThe reference amino acid solution is injected by first\nsurizing the reagent container via S-17, closing S-17\nopening S-18 and S-4 to permit flow. This reagent is\nused again until the next analysis. Excess reagent in\nline is vented through S-5.\n\n7)\n\npresand\nnot\nthe\n\nInject H 2 0 Into Extractor\nThe first step of the analysis consists of water extraction.\nThis process has the advantage over the previously used first\nstep of acid hydrolysis in that less interfering material from\nthe soil is present during the actual hydrolysis.\nThis allows for milder desalting conditions: elimination of the\nHF/OH- desalting step and a volume reduction in the ion\nexchange resin.\nThe water is injected into the extractor by opening S-21 to\npressurize the reagent container, closing S-21, then opening\nS-22 and S-4.\n\n8)\n\nClean Line\nAfter reagent injection, housekeeping details are carried out\nto wash and vent injection lines. The line is vented by opening and closing S-5. It is then flushed with water by opening\nS-22 and dried by gas purge through S-27.\n\n9)\n\nHeat Extractor\nThe extractor is then heated to 165 \xc2\xb15 0 C for an hour, then\ncooled to below 50 0 C, in order to conduct the extraction step.\n\n10)\n\nTransfer Extract to Hydrolyzer/Evaporator\nThe extract is then filtered away from the soil.\nlyzer cell is heated to 10 0 C with H-2.\n\nThe hydro-\n\nFiltration is accomplished by opening valves S-4 and S-6\nbetween the two cells and allowing the solution to flow after\nventing the hydrolyzer/evaporator.\nCompletion is assured\nby subsequent pressurization of the extractor, then allowing\nflow through S-4 and S-6 again into the hydrolyzer/evaporator.\n11)\n\nInject HC1 Into the Hydrolyzer\nThe amino acids present in life containing soils are at least\npartially in the form of biopolymers (peptides and proteins).\n4-21\n\nThus, a major step in the separation and detection is to break\ndown any polymers in the extract into the individual amino\nacids by acid hydrolysis.\nReagent injection is accomplished by pressurizing the HC1\nreservoir and then injecting the HC1 with the volume controlled by the time the HCI injection valve is open.\n12)\n\nStart Hydrolysis\nThe hydrolysis is conducted by heating the hydrolyzer/\nevaporator at 110 0 C for 5 hours. While the hydrolysis is\nbeing carried out a pre-elution and regeneration of the ion\nexchange column is conducted to ready the IEC for use.\n\n13)\n\nClean Lines\nOnce again any HC1 or extract residue remaining in the lines\nis removed by washing and drying the lines.\n\n14)\n\nPre-elute Ion Exchange Column\nDuring storage, ion exchange resin by-products develop\nwhich interfere with gas chromatograph data. Much of these\nby-products can be eliminated by cycling the ion exchange\ncolumn through base and then acid (with water washes\nbetween reagents) immediately prior to experimental use.\nIon exchange column cycling is initiated by first pressurizing\nthe NaOH container via S-25, closing S-25 and injecting 10ml\nthrough S-26. The IEC effluent is vented through S-10, S9.\n\n15)\n\nWash Ion Exchange Column\nThe NaOH elution is followed by a 20 milliliter water wash\naccomplished by pressurizing the reservoir, then flowing\nthrough S-22 and S-28. Valve S-9, which was closed at\ncompletion of NaOH injection to prevent gas from entering\nthe IEC, is reopened to allow liquid flow.\n\n16)\n\nRegenerate Ion Exchange Column\nThe resin is then returned to the acid form necessary for\nactual use by washing with 15 milliliters 6N HC1.\nThis is done by pressurizing the HC1 injector, then flowing\nthrough S-20. Valve S-9, closed as a protective measure,\nis again opened to allow flow.\nAfter the HCI injection, the line is vented through S-5 to\neliminate HCI contamination of following injections.\n\n4-22\n\n17)\n\nWash Ion Exchange Column\nThe ion exchange column is then washed to neutrality with\n20 milliliters H 2 0 injected in the same manner as above. At\nthe completion of the washing step, the water injector heater\nis turned off, and the line heaters are turned off to conserve\npower.\n\n18)\n\nEnd Hydrolysis, Evaporate HC1 Solution\nAt the completion of the hydrolysis step the cell heater power\nis reduced by changing the set point to 20 0 C and allowing the\ncell to cool below 50 0 C so that the vent valve can be opened\nwithout bumping.\nEvaporation is then accomplished by opening S-7 and heating\nto 100 0 C. The evaporation rate is controlled by a flow\nrestrictor located downstream of the valve (FR-1).\nThe heater is designed to provide enough heat input for the\nevaporation process and any heat transfer to the attaching\nhardware. A 50 percent evaporation time margin is provided to assure complete evaporation.\nAt the completion of evaporation the cell is then allowed to\ncool below 500C. Heaters are again powered to gas supply\nline, fluid line and water injector (H-9, H-12, H-15).\n\n19)\n\nDissolve Amino Acids and Residual Salts\nThe residue from the preceding step is dissolved in 5 milliliters water which is injected in the nominal manner as above.\n\n20)\n\nMix by Gas Bubbling\nThe solution is stirred alternately by pressurizations with\nHe/H 2 , then venting at 0. 1 minute intervals. This process\nis repeated for a total of ten cycles to insure complete dissolution of sample. The hydrolyzer is allowed to cool to\n200 to 25 0 C. Line heaters are turned on (H-13, H-14) for\nsubsequent use.\n\n21)\n\nPlace Solution on Ion Exchange Column\nThe amino acid solution is then placed on a strong acid-type\ncation exchange resin column which is in the acid form. As\nlong as the solution is not too acidic or too alkaline, the\namino acids and residual cations are retained and can be\nwashed. The amino acids can be eluted with an ammonia\nsolution while the inorganic cations are still retained (except\naluminum). In order for the ion exchange purification procedure to be effective, the flow rate through the column must\nbe slow enough (less than 0. 5 ml/min) to allow the exchange\nreactions to equilibrate.\n4-23\n\nFlow is highly restricted at the IEC outlet to assure that\nliquid in the column does not flash into a two-phase mixture.\nFlow direction is from the bottom up to provide a slight\nincrease in column efficiency and to insure maintenance of\na liquid column even if the evaporator flow resistance\ndominates (i. e., no flow from the column caused by gravity).\nBecause of the possibility of flow variations out of the\nhydrolyzer/evaporator into the IEC, and because simple\ntimed sequencing is not an adequate method for recovering\nall of the liquid contents of the cell, a liquid sensor is provided between the hydrolyzer/evaporator and IEC. This\nsensor consists simply of two electrodes. While fluid is in\ncontact with both electrodes, it will provide a low resistance\ncircuit. A gas interface will interrupt this circuit, indicating completion of the flow process. This open circuit will\ntrigger the closing of the hydrolyzer/evaporator outlet valve\nand IEC vent valve.\n22)\n\nWash Ion Exchange Column\nWater is injected through the IEC to wash out non-retained\nmaterial. This is accomplished in the nominal manner, first\nby pressurizing the water injector, then injecting 15 milliliter\nwater by opening S-22, S-28 and S-9. The ammonia injector\nheater (H-10) is also turned on in this step.\n\n23)\n\nElute Ion Exchange Column\nElution of the amino acids is accomplished with ammonia.\nEnough reagent must be supplied to displace all of the liquid\nwithin the column (if flow were from the top down, a smaller\nquantity of NH 4 0H solution, followed by gas, might be used),\nand also account for the reaction of the ammonia with the ion\nexchange resin which is still in the acid form. Injection after\ninjector pressurization through S-23 is accomplished by opening the IEC vent valve S-9. After a sufficient quantity has\nbeen injected, the water wash will have been displaced, and\nthe amino acids will be in the first portion of the NH 4 OH\neffluent.\nPrior to amino acid collection, the deriVatizer is heated to\n10 0 C and is vented via S-12.\n\n24)\n\nCollect Amino Acids in Derivatizer\nAt the point of ammonia breakthrough, and accompanying\namino acids, the vent valve S-10 is closed and the inlet\nvalve to the derivatizer S-11 is opened.\nThe baseline design uses a timed sequence to perform this\noperation. The first 2 millimeters of ammonia contain\nvirtually all the amino acids. Four minutes after ammonia\n4-24\n\nbreakthrough the appropriate 2 millimeters will have eluted.\nCollecting additional solution would increase the amount of\nsalts collected with the amino acids.\nAt this time the derivatizer inlet valve, the IEC outlet valve and the ammonia\ninjection valve are closed. Line vent valve S-5 is opened\nfor a time to clean the line.\n25)\n\nEvaporate Ammonia Solution\nAfter the effluent from the purification procedure is transferred to the derivatization cell, it is dried by a timed heating period with vapor removal through an orifice as in the\nprevious evaporation step. The vent valve is opened, and\nthe derivatizer is heated to 100 0 C for 120 minutes.\nThe\nderivatizer is then cooled to below 20 0 C.\nThe amino acids in their free state are very polar and hence\ncannot be volatilized without decomposition nor separated by\ngas chromatography directly.\nHowever, by carrying out\nreactions such as esterification of the carboxylic acid group\nand acylation of the amino group, volatile derivatives are\nformed which can then be separated by gas chromatography.\nIn addition to separating the amino acids from each other, it\nis also desirable to separate the two optical isomers of those\namino acids which contain an asymmetric site since strong\ninterferences as to the possibility of biogenic origin of the\namino acids can be made based on the isomer ratios.\nHowever, the two optical isomers of a given amino acid are\nequivalent in a symmetric environment.\nIf an alcohol such\nas 2-butanol which is also optically active is used to esterify\nthe carboxylic acid function, the diastereomers are formed\nwith those amino acids which also contain asymmetric sites.\nNow the derivatives with the same optical configuration at\nboth asymmetric sites (DD and LL) are chemically and\nphysically different from those derivatives with different\noptical configuration at the two asymmetric sites (DL and LD)\nand can be separated by a variety of gas chromatographic\ncolumns.\nNinety percent pure 2-butanol is used so that two\npeaks are obtained for each optically active amino acid regardless of the optical purity of the amino acids in order to confirm the separation and identification by the gas chromatograph.\n\n26)\n\nInject 2-Butanol/HC1 Into Derivatizer\nSince the 2-butanol/HCl mixture cannot withstand the sterilization conditions without excessive reaction, the anhydrous\nHC1 gas is not mixed with the 2-butanol until the instrument\nis functioning at its destination. The temperatures experienced by the 2-butanol/HC1 solution at the destination are\nmoderate enough so that the solution will be stable through\nthe 90-day life of the instrument. Hence, this reagent need\nonly be prepared once. This is done the first time the\nexperiment is performed.\n4-25\n\nPrior to reagent injection, the lines are cleaned of any\nresidue water vapor or other contaminants that would interfere with the derivatization process. This is done by alternately venting butanol/HC1l through S-32 and S-10 and purging\nwith He/H 2 through S-29. This is done a total of three times.\nThe injection of 0. 5 milliliter 2-butanol/HC1 is accomplished\nby opening the derivatizer inlet valve S-11, followed by opening the injection valve S-32 for 1 minute and then closing it.\n27)\n\nEsterify Amino Acids\nThe actual esterification of the amino acids is accomplished\nby heating to 100 0 C for 2 hours. At the end of the 2-hour\nperiod the derivatizer is allowed to cool to below 50 0 C to\nprevent bumping when the vent valve is opened to start the\nsubsequent evaporation.\n\n28)\n\nEvaporate Butanol/HC1l\nThe butanol/HCl is then evaporated through S-12 while heating to 1000C again. When evaporation is complete, the cell\nis cooled to below 200C.\n\n29)\n\nInject Trifluoroacetic Anhydride/Methylene\nSolution into Derivatizer\n\nChloride\n\nAfter the carboxylic acid function has been esterified and\nexcess reagent has been removed, the amino function is\nacylated with trifluoroacetic anhydride with methylene\nchloride present as a solvent. The resulting N-TFA-2-butyl\nderivatives of the amino acids are quite volatile and are\nreadily separated and resolved by gas chromatography.\nOther acylating agents could be used in place of the trifluoroacetic anhydride, but because of its short reaction\ntimes and lack of interference in the gas chromatographic\nseparation, it is the reagent of choice.\nThe fluid lines are cleaned prior to use in the same manner\nas with the preceding reagent, cycling between TFA/\nmethylene chloride and He/H 2 purge gas twice before\ninjection.\nThe injection process is accomplished through S-31 and S-11.\n30)\n\nAcylate Amino Acid Esters\nThe final derivatization step is accomplished by heating the\ncell to 37 0 C for 1 hour. At the end of this step the cell is\nallowed to cool.\n\n4-26\n\n31)\n\nEvaporate Trifluoracetic Anhydride/Methylene Chloride\nPrior to injection of the derivatized amino acids into the gas\nchromatographic column, the reaction reagents must be\neliminated. To prevent loss of the volatile derivates,\nThe thermo-electric\nevaporation is carried out below 100C.\nEvaporacooler is used to control the temperature at 00C.\ntion occurs through S-12.\n\n32)\n\nEvaporate Derivatives Onto GC Column\nThe current sequence calls for direct evaporation of the\nderivatives out of the derivatizer cell onto the GC column for\nultimate separation and an analysis. Prior to this evaporation the GC is turned on: the detector heater (H-6) and gas\nsupply, the GC column gas supply and heaters, and the 02\nsupply heater.\nThe derivatizer is then opened (S-11, S-13) to the GC columnn and heated to 1000C to evaporate the amino acid\nderivaties onto the column, while the GC column is kept\ncool enough to trap the derivatives.\nThe pressurant gas\nsupply is used to sweep the derivatizer and act as a carrier\ngas during this event. At the conclusion of this event, the\nderivatizer heater and solenoid valves are turned off. This\nprocedure results in trapping the entire sample quantity in\nthe first few feet of the GC column.\nIn order to achieve a good separation in a gas chromatograph,\nthe sample vapor in the column at the start of the separation\nmust be concentrated in a small volume of carrier gas. If\nthe volume of carrier gas is large (broad), poorly resolved\npeaks are obtained.\nThis factor becomes increasingly\nimportant as the size of the column is decreased, so that\nwith capillary columns sample introduction can be a serious\nproblem.\nEffective dead volume, i. e. , that part of the volume in the\nactive portion of the introduction, column and detector flow\npaths which is not effective in the separation, is also an\nimportant consideration. The effect of dead volume is to\nspread the sample components into a greater volume of carrier gas, thus degrading resolution\nBy trapping the derivatives in the cool column and then\nheating the column to start the separation, any problem from\nslow introduction of the sample into the carrier gas and any\ndead volume effects prior to the column are eliminated. This\nintroduction technique is that the column be cool enough to\nimmobilize the derivatives during the sample introduction\nand that contaminant volatiles are not introduced from the\nderivatizer.\n\n4-27\n\nThe overall system sensitivity requirement is to detect\n0. 1 nanomole of each amino acid in the original soil sample\n(with a goal of 0. 01 nanomole). To meet this requirement\nit is necessary to introduce the entire quantity of the resulting amino acid derivatives into the gas chromatograph. On\nthe other hand, the possibility of a relatively rich soil\nsample cannot be discounted. In this case, the amount of\nderivatives present might exceed the capacity of the column\nso that it would no longer give good resolution and separation. (The specification allows for this possibility by relaxing the resolution requirements for samples containing\ngreater than 50 nanomoles).\nWhen evaporation is completed, the gas flow path is switched\nfrom the derivatized cell to a valve leading directly to the\nGC column.\n33)\n\nStart FID\nThe FID is started by opening the oxygen gas supply valve\nS-33, and then activating the hot wire ignitor. If combustion\nis not initiated, the ignitor shuts off the fuel and after a\nsuitable delay again opens the fuel valve and again attempts\nto ignite the mixture. After ignition, the FID heater and\ntemperature sensor are used to maintain the detector temperature at 200 0 C.\n\n34)\n\nCarry Out Gas Chromatographic Analysis\nTo carry out the gas chromatographic separation, the column which now contains the trapped derivatives is heated in\na controlled manner. First, the column is heated rapidly\nto the temperature at which the separation of the more\nvolatile amino acid derivatives begins, then the temperature\nis raised at a rate that will give good separations and short\nretention times.\nThe derivatives have a wide range of volatility so that the\nideal temperature for resolution of each amino acid derivative is different. If a column is operated isothermally to\nresolve the low boiling derivatives, the high boiling derivatives emerge as broad peaks of low sensitivity and long\nretention time. By the use of a controlled increase in the\ntemperature of the column during the analysis (temperature\nprogramming), each component is separated close to its\noptimum temperature. The result is that high boiling compounds are eluted earlier and as sharp peaks, thus decreasing analysis time and increasing the overall sensitivity of\nthe system. However, as the temperature of the column is\nincreased, volatility of the liquid phase increases. If\nappreciable, noise and an upward drift in the base line\nresult.\n\n4-28\n\nThe amount of bleeding which can be tolerated acts as an\nupper bound to the temperature profile. The exact temperature profile will be determined by the particular column\nultimately selected to carry out the separation. Data collection will start at a predetermined time after column temperature programming is initiated. As an example, a profile\nused in the laboratory with a Carbowax 20M column is: heat\nthe column oven from 25 0 C (trapping temperature) to 100 0 C\nin 10 minutes, then heat from 100 0 C to 170 0 C at lo/min.\nFinally, hold the column at 170 0 C until the analysis is completed. In contrast to laboratory practice of using a forced\nconvection oven, the instrument GC column will be heated\ndirectly, using the column tube as the resistance heater\nelement.\nThis method of heating is more efficient and compact than\nlaboratory practice and should also give better control and\nreproducibility. The FID is maintained above the maximum\ncolumn temperature for the entire analysis.\nUpon the conclusion of data collection, the oxygen is turned\noff. The column and detector heaters are left on for a time\nperiod which will depend on the column ultimately chosen\n(for example, 1/2 to 1 hour). The purpose of this step is to\npurge any material of low volatility in the column so that it\nwill not interfere with subsequent analyses. Upon completion\nof this purging period, the column, and then the FID heater\nare shut off.\n35)\n\nSystem Cleanup\nThe system requires cleanup of the processing cells and\nconnecting lines and posibly a heating and purge of the GC\ncolumn between analyses. The detailed cleaning steps will\nrequire further laboratory development so a detailed sequence\nfor these steps has not been defined. However, the general\noperations and requirements are known. The cells and lines\nwill be cleaned with a series of reagent soaks, heatings and\nflushes. The IEC would be regenerated and possibly cycled\none or more times. Thus the overall time and power requirements for the cleaning sequence will be similar to that of the\nactual operating sequence. The power and time requirements\nfor the cleaning sequence would not be expected to exceed that\nrequired for the operating sequence.\n\n4. Z2 INSTRUMENT SYSTEM DESIGN\nThe original flight design presented in TRW\'s Final Report No.\n16660-6001-RO-00 was based on Processing Sequence No.\nalso used for the breadboard test program.\n\n1, which was\n\nOngoing research at NASA/ARC\n\nresulted in process modifications and Processing Sequence No. 2 was\nselected as the baseline flight sequence.\n4-29\n\nThere are significant differences between the two sequences:\n\nIn the\n\nprevious sequence, acidic hydrolysis was carried out directly on the soil.\nThis was followed by filtration, evaporation of HCI and then by a\nHF-NH4 0H desalting process.\n\nThis was followed in turn with final desalt-\n\ning on a rather large (30 milliliters) ion exchange resin column.\n\nElution\n\nof the column, derivatization, and a gas chromatographic analysis completed the procedures.\n\nIn the new process, the soil is extracted with\n\nH 2 0 at 165 0 C for 1 hour, the extract is filtered off and HC1 is added to\nthe extract.\n\nAfter 5 hours of hydrolysis at 110 0 C, the HC1 solution is\n\nevaporated to dryness, the product redissolved and passed directly onto a\nsmall (5 milliliters) ion exchange column.\nexcept for volume adjustments.\n\nSubsequent steps are unchanged\n\nWhile the new procedure may have some-\n\nwhat reduced recoveries with some types of samples and may cause a\nsmall amount of racemization, it has many advantages including easier\nfiltration requirements, fewer and less corrosive reagents, and significantly less interfering material, especially from the smaller ion\nexchange column.\nBecause of these differences and because of problems uncovered in\nthe breadboard test program, the flight design has been significantly\nmodified.\n\nA major modification is the elimination of the three separate\n\nsets of non-reusable processing cells, and the introduction of only one\nset of processing cells which can be used repeatedly.\n\nAs pointed out\n\nbefore, the basic design of all instrument components was not changed due\nto the modifications in the flight processing sequence and the current test\ncells,\n\nion exchange column, and GC-column are flight weight designs of\n\nthe prototype breadboard components.\nWhile the previous design of the instrument is modified, the basic\ndesign philosophy remains unchanged.\n\nThe adopted modular design\n\napproach facilitates testibility, and repair and replacement capability\nthe component,\n\nsubsystem and system level.\n\ntechnology are chosen whenever\n\nat\n\nViking \'75 hardware and\n\nthis leads to the elimination of duplicate\n\nengineering development efforts and to potential cost savings.\n\nMargins\n\nare provided for each component design and contingencies are built in for\nweight, volume, electronic parts and board space, valves,\n\n4-30\n\nheaters,\n\netc.\n\nThe instrument is designed to simplified VLBI interface specificaprovitions and the VLBI structural design concept is used, including the\ncontrol\nsion for accommodating the lander soil processor loads. Thermal\nis achieved by isolators, emissivity coatings, heaters and one thermoelectric cooler for the derivatizer.\n\nThe average instrument power for one\n\nanalysis is approximately 18 watts (cold case) averaged over 1 day, but\ncan easily be brought down to below the maximum specified 16. 3 watts.\nThe instrument weight with reagents is 29. 4 pounds.\nThe instrument system package consists of two major subsystems.\nThe mechanical subsystem (MSS) which contains the soil distribution\nassembly and the processing assembly, and the electronic subsystem\n(ESS). A view of the assembled instrument depicting the two subsystems\nand the location of major instrument components is shown in Figure 4-3.\nAlso shown is how the Lander soil processor interfaces with the Wet\nChemistry Instrument.\nThe primary structure in the mechanical subsystem is an aluminum\nare\nexperiment mounting plate to which all major instrument components\nattached. The experiment mounting plate attaches with titanium struts to\nthe upper mounting plate which interfaces with the Lander mounting plate,\nand which provides mounting points and load support for the Lander soil\nprocessor.\nThe electronic subsystem is contained in a single module which\nfastens directly to the Lander mounting plate. The electrical connection\nbetween the ESS and MSS is established with a cable harness ending in\nelectrical connectors inside the MSS.\n4. 2. 1 Interfaces\nAn interface control drawing of the instrument is presented in\nFigure 4-4. The interface to the Lander is identical to the VLBI interface\nThere is only one thermoelectric cooler\ninstead of four on VLBI, and the thermal interface plate which is required\nfor the VLBI soil illumination lamp has been eliminated.

The maximum dry weight specified is 30 pounds so\ngiven in Table 4-4.\n\nthat on almost 10 percent weight margin is left.\n4. 2. 3\n\nThermal Design and Power Profile\nTRW\'s overall approach to the thermal control of the Wet Chemistry\n\ninstrument is essentially unchanged from that formulated in Section 3. 2. 5\nof the Contract NAS 2-6218 Final Report, i. e.:\n*\n\nThermally isolate the instrument from the Lander mounting\nplate to minimize the effect of variations in mounting plate\ntemperatures.\n\n*\n\nPhysically mount and isolate components (or series of components) within the instrument according to their specific\nrequirements.\n\nThe thermal model constructed during this previous contract\nassumed metallic conduction to be the dominant mode of heat transfer\nwithin the instrument.\n\nExperience gained in the thermal design of the\n\nVLBI instrument from 1971 to 1974 indicates that if a temperature controlled component is mounted to a colder platform, conduction across\nthe mount amounts to around half of the total heat loss, with most of the\nremainder attributable to gas conduction.\n\nLosses due to IR radiation and\n\nnatural convection are usually small but not negligible.\n\nAccordingly an\n\napproximate analysis accounting for all heat transfer modes was conducted\nfor each component of the revised instrument to determine worst cold case\npower requirements.\n\nEach component was considered separately con-\n\nnected to a mounting plate at -15\n\n0\n\nF (-26 0 C).\n\nThis procedure should pro-\n\nduce conservative cold case power since the heat lost by each component\nwill tend to warm the surroundings of all components, thus reducing subsequent losses.\n\n4-35\n\nTable 4-3.\n\nWeight Summary\nWeight (Pounds)\n0.3\n\nSoil Distributor\nTest Cells\nExtractor\n\n0.4\n\nHydrolyzer\n\n0.6\n\nDerivatizer\n\n0.4\n\nIon Exchange Column\n\n0.2\n\nGas Chromatographic Column\n\n0.5\n\nFlame Ionization Detector\n\n0.2\n\nReagent Injectors\nAmino Acids\n\n0. 3\n\nHC1\n\n0.6\n\nH20\n\n0.5\n\nNH 4 0H\n\n0.5\n\nNaOH\n\n0.5\n\nHC1/Butanol\n\n0. 3\n\nTFAA/MC\n\n0.4\n\nIsolation Valves\n\n0. 8\n\nHe/H\n\n2\n\ni. 3\n\nSubsystem\n\ni. 3\n\n02 Subsystem\nSolenoid Valves and Block\n\n0. 8\n\nGas Operated Valves\n\n1.5\n\nPlumbing\n\n0.5\n\nWaste Management\n\n0. 2\n\nThermoelectric Installation\n\n0. 3\n\nPrimary Structure\n\n5.9\n\nElectronics Subsystem\n\n8.4\n\nElectrical Installation\n\n0. 6\n\nTotal Dry Weight\n\n27. 3\n\nConsummable s\nGases\n\n0.3\n\nLiquids\n\n1.8\n\nTotal Weight\n\n29.4\n\n4-36\n\nTable 4-4.\n\nWeight Assessment\nPounds\n\nPercentage\n\n14.4\n\n53\n\nWeight Based on Modified Components\n\n7. 3\n\n27\n\nWeight Based on Prototype Components\n\n2. 3\n\n8\n\nWeight Based on Conceptual Design\n\n3. 3\n\n12\n\nWeight Based on VLBI Components\n\n27.3\n\nTotal Dry Weight\n\n100%\n\nFigure 4-5 shows the cold case power profile for a single analysis.\nThe profile assumes a -15 0 F instrument interface temperature and is\nlargely based on the thermal hand calculations described above. These\ncalculations were based on worse case assumptions.\n\nSomewhat lower\n\npower requirements would be indicated by a thermal analyzer program\nmodel in which heat dissipated in each component could soak to adjacent\ncomponents.\nThe average power for a single analysis is 18.1 watts averaged over\nthe 2073 minute duration of a compact sequence. This exceeds the total\n16. 3 watts available in the cold case according to specification NASA/ARC\nA-16231 Rev. 3 (October 15,\n\n1973).\n\nProgramming a 400 minute hold\n\nbetween extraction and hydrolysis will cause the average power to fall\nbelow the specified 16. 3 watt level. Thus 2473 minutes are required for\na single analysis.\nParagraph 2. 1.3. 7. 4 of the specification requires that operating\npower consumption excluding heaters not exceed 10 watt averaged over\n15 days or 7. 6 watts averaged over one day. If operating power is defined\nas power to operate electronics and actuate valves only 4. 6 to 5. 0 average\nwatts of this category will be used.\n\nOn the other hand, the formula given\n\nfor heater power allows 8. 72 watts in the cold case (-150F interface).\nClearly the heater power situation for the Wet Chemistry instrument is\nsomewhat different than for VLBI.\n\nIn VLBI heaters typically are used to\n\n4-37\n\nFOLDOUT FRAM-\n\nTH-KMEAL VALVE ATUAT/ON 5\nEAN\n(45 W,47ATT Fak 4MINUT5 e\nG4,\n\n4LVM At\n\nFLAME ,ONI/gA7/ON\nH EA-TER\nPETE7 T\n\n30\n\nKEAG-ENT INEL7TOR\nS~UPLY AND>\n-AS\nINE\n\nPFKIVA\nPHEAT-R TI ZER\n\n-OOL ER\n\n/1\nV3\n\n,ATT\n\nION\n\nEK6/IAN6E\n\n__\n\ncOLuMN\n\nFIONCTRONI15\n\n0\n\n100\n\n200\n\n300\n\no\n\nS0\n600\n\n700\n\no00o\n\niO\n\n000\n\nIOo\n\n/200\n\n1300\n\nLtOO\n\n,00\n\nd/00\n\n/\n\n/,/00\n\n100\n\n2000\n\nOPE;AT&- T/ME, MINTES\nFigure 4-5.\n\n4-38\n\nPower Profile,\n-150F Lander Plate\n\n2/O10\n\nhold low incubation temperatures for hours at a time and much more heat\nis required in a cold case environment than in the hot case. In the wet\nchemistry instrument the reaction vessel heaters are used to actually\noperate the instrument, i. e. to heat solutions quickly to over 100 0 C and\nto evaporate samples and solvents.\n\nNearly as much heater power is\n\nrequired to evaporate a solution at 1000C in -260C surroundings as in\n+4 0 C surroundings.\n\nIndeed hot case heater power is expected to be about\n\n85 percent of the cold case requirement.\n\nThus the specification can not\n\nbe satisfied in the hot case with present power allowances.\n4.3\n\nMECHANICAL SUBASSEMBLY AND COMPONENTS DESIGN\nAn exploded view of the mechanical subsystem is shown in Figure\n\n4-6.\n\nIt illustrates the assembly of the mechanical components including\n\nthe soil distributor onto the experiment mounting plate, which attaches to\nthe upper mounting plate with titanium struts.\n\nThe assembled MSS is\n\nenclosed by a metal enclosure as shown in Figure 4-3.\n4. 3. 1 Soil Distribution Assembly\nA layout drawing of the proposed soil distribution assembly (SDA) is\nshown in Figure 4-7.\n\nIt shows a greatly simplified version of the VLBI\n\nsoil distribution assembly.\n\nThe latter (Figure 4-8) is required to deliver\n\nthree soil samples of different sizes to three different locations, while\nthis experiment requires the delivery of three soil samples of only one\nsize to only one location.\n\nOtherwise the same design parameters and\n\nrequirements as for VLBI have been specified.\nThe SDA consists of a soil inlet tube for receipt of the bulk soil\nfrom the Lander soil processer, a metering tube for measuring the bulk\nsoil, a soil carrier (shuttle) for transporting the sample to the extractor,\na dump cell for the excess soil, and a drive motor. These components\nare mounted on an aluminum bracket.\n\nAlso on the bracket is the gas\n\nactuated extractor cover.\nThe prototype of the VLBI SDA flight units has now completed more\nthan 2300 cycles at from -2000F to 97 0 F and at 8 millibars to ambient air\npressure without a single failure of any sort.\n\nIt has never failed to\n\ndeliver the correct soil samples using four different soil models at various\nhumidities, made up to VLBI specifications.\n4-39\n\nVALVE BLOCK\nSOIL\nDISTRIBUTION\nASSEMBLY\nNaOH INJECTOR\n\nI\n\nHYDROLYZER\nCHANGE\nION\nCOLUMN\n\nHCLINJECTOR\n\nEXTRACTOR\n\nNH 4 0H INJECTOR\nH2 0\nINJECTOR\n\nTRAP\n\nSUMP\n\nFLAME IONIZATION\n\nCHROMATOGRAPHIC\nCOLUMN\n\nH2/HeGAS SUPPLY\nTFAA/MC\nINJECTOR\n\nDERIVATIZER\n\n02 GAS SUPPLY\n\nBUTANOL/HCL INJECTOR\n\nCALIBRATION AMINO ACID\n\nFigure 4-6.\n\nWet Chemistry Instrument\n(Mechanical Subassembly)\n\n4-40\n\nPLAN\n\nSEXTRACTOR\n\nVIEWS\n\nOF\n\nSHUTTLE\n\nCOVER\nEXTRACTOR COVER\n\nEXTRACTOR\nINLET PORT\n\n35\n\nDUMP CAVITY PORT\n\nSTEP\n\n1\n\nSTEP\n\n2\n\nSTEP\n\n3\n\nIDENTICAL SDA MOTOR, --UNIVERSAL COUPLING,\nBEARINGS, BRUSHES,\n\nSEQUENCE OF OPERATION\nSTEP\n\nSTEP\n\n1.

It\nalso ensures complete emptying of all surplus soil into the\ndump cavity in preparation for the next bulk sample.\n\n*\n\nCarry-over from one bulk sample to the next is thus far less\nthan 5%.\n\n4. 3. 2 Processing Cells\nThe general design requirements for the three types of processing\ncells (extractor, hydrolyzer/evaporator,\n\nand derivatizer) are similar.\nThe three cells share the same basic material problems of resistance to\nattack by corrosive reagents, and prevention of sample contamination\nsample loss.\n\nor\n\nAll three components need reagent and He/H 2 gas injection\n\nports, vent ports, and outlet ports.\n\nEach of the three cells is required\n\nto maintain thermal control over the various steps in the individual\nprocesses.\n\nThe internal configurations must be designed to insure\n\nproper cell operation over the \xc2\xb135-degree range of Lander tilt angles.\nThe extractor has the unique requirement for a mechanism at the top to\naccept the sample from the soil distribution device.\n\nThe extractor and\n\nhydrolyzer/evaporator require filters at their outlets.\n\nThe hydrolyzer/\n\nevaporator and derivatizer require evaporation of fluids as a part of\ntheir processing cycle.\n4.3.2.1\n\nExtractor\n\nA layout drawing of the extractor is presented in Figure 4-9.\nextractor is a flight weight version of the breadboard hydrolyzer\n\nThe\n\n(described in Section 3.1.2), and consists of an all tantalum structure\n4-43\n\nREVISIONS\nLTi\n\nDESCRIPTIO\n\nOATE\n\nAPPROVED\n\n3\n\n3.00\nACTUAr/e\n\nPOQT\n\n-\n\n/\n/\n\n-\n\n4S\n\n/\n\n-\n\nE1TA\n-\n\nTNRA\n\nCHE7\'A\n7-E T\n\n__T_\n\n/\n\nTTA\n\nCLLZ 8ODY\n\n// 49\n\nL dh\'\n\nTA /VTA4 ZL-U\n\n7\n\n/\n\nI-\n\nIEADPLATE\nIDEC-EC TO\nEAL\n"7LTR\n//\n\nI\n\n/I\n\nTA /V TA LUZ\nS0M/COV TEFLOV\n\n_VAE PLATE 7TA.\n\nNE UNLESS\nOTERWSE\n\nu.\n\n......\n\nm\n\n.\no/\n\nx,\n\n..\nR\noS\n\nurT\n\nAPPUCABLE\nSPECIFICATIONS T\n\n/a~-\n\nLUI\n\nA\n\n1B,\n8\nLY\n\nVEAT\n\nExtractor Assembly\n\nE\n\nI\n\nXTRACTOR\n\n3491\n\nER\n\nt\nFigure 4-9.\n\n\'m\'\n\n3\n\n11982\n\nwith multiple Teflon filters.\n\nMajor modifications to the breadboard\n\ndesign are:\n1)\n\nThe extractor head end is welded to the cell body and the\ninlet port accepts the gas actuated extractor cover which\nis part of the soil distribution assembly.\n\n2)\n\nThe hand operated solenoid valve simulator is replaced by\na gas actuated tantalum diaphragm valve.\n\nThe extractor is currently sized for a 1 cubic centimeter soil\nsample to be extracted with 10 milliliters of H 2 0,\nthrough the outlet port.\n\nwhich is injected\n\nA TBD amount of calibration amino acids is also\n\ninjected and included in the 10 milliliters total H 2 0 volume.\n\nThe outlet\n\nport is also used to inject pressurization gas for fluid transfer.

The\nMajor\n\nderivatizer is an all tantalum cell with flanged tantalum head end.\n\nmodifications to the breadboard version are in the detailed design of the\nhead end which has three gas actuated tantalum diaphragm valves in the\nvent line, inlet, and outlet to the GC column.\n\nBecause the reagent vol-\n\numes in the new baseline process are smaller than in the process used in\nthe breadboard,\n\nthe volume of the flight design derivatizer can be reduced,\n\npending the outcome of further breadboard tests.\nevaporator,\n\nAs in the hydrolyzer/\n\nthe center tube is used for reagent and gas injection, and\n\nalso to receive the effluent from the ion exchange column.\nContamination problems experienced with the breadboard derivatizer\ndue to the use of elastomeric seals in the hand-operated valve simulators\nare minimized with the all tantalum diaphragm valves (with Teflon seats),\nwhich are sealed to the derivatizer head end with tantalum/Teflon seals.\n4. 3. 3.\n\nIon Exchange Column\nA layout drawing of the ion exchange column (IEC) design is\n\nin Figure 4-12.\n\nshown\n\nThe design is again a flight weight version of the ion\n\nexchange column used in the breadboard (described in Section 3. 1. 6).\nThe IEC consists of a thin walled tantalum tube with gas actuated tantalum\ndiaphragm valves at the inlet and outlet to hermetically seal the IEC\nduring interplanetary cruise.\n\nThe major difference to the breadboard\n\nIEC is the size of the resin bed which is 5 milliliters as compared to\n30 milliliters in the breadboard.\n\nReduction in resin volume is possible\n\nin the new baseline processing sequence because hydrolysis is\n\ncarried out\n\nnot on the soil but on the water extract of the soil, and because the\n\nHF/NH4 0H precipitation step is eliminated.\n4-47\n\nThis results in the formation\n\nREVISIONS\nDATE\n\nL~TDESCRIPTION\n\nACET/A\nPOR7\n\nAPPROVED\n\nT/OT\n\n5\n\n1.25\n\nA 4\n\nA\n\nV7 L U,\'\nA\n\n_\n\n2\n\n/\n\n/-EA TER\n\n/0\n\n/\n\n75\n\nPLA7T\nVALVE,\nUArEVALVPLATE\n\n8\n\n,no-gr TusE\nC,45 AC7ZIA 7-_,_\n\n3\n\nVSAL VC\n\nPLGE\n\n/\n\n?NTES UKLS OHIEWI\n\nSPEFIED\n\nc_\n\nr\n\nUL E\n\nTmt\n\nUISS OnEH\n\nAPPUCATIOS4\n\nEST\n\n-E.=\nW-\n\nEOSS EMSR\n\n.\n\nO\n\nFigure 4-11.\n\nFOLLOWCNG HAVE\nES\nTHE\nPRINT\nTO\nATTACHEDTHIS\nBEEN\n\nM\n\nSECIFED\nT RNES\n\n71M\n\n,\n\nIN, /l\n\nWAS\nRED\n\nsp\n\nPARTS \'LI ST\n\nSILEOAIIIA\nSDOOTR\n\n,\n\n//\n\nTAA/TALU/1\n\nnoS\n\nQTYREQDPERASSY\n\nL.\n\nTA_/__L_\n\nS.R__\n\nA198\n\n+\n\nn.\n\n.. l\n\nITREE...\n\n/E __\n\nLt\nDerivatizer Assembly\n\nf\n\n/A\n\nT/ E\nPD4OS.I\n\nI\n\n1\n\nREVISIONS\nDElWPTIM\n\nLM\n\nAC UARe\n\nD\n\nae7-VTL\n\n2;\n\n/-\n\n900y\n\nA/7-\n\nL 0/-7\n\nl7-.Z\n\n-\n\nI\nQTYREQD\nPERASSY\n\nCsO\n\nUN\n\nPARTS LIST\nERWSE\n-EDIDED\n\nNa\n\nTE FOLLOWING HAVE\nToHCO\nEWS\nBEEN\nATTACHEDTHIS\nTO\nPRIN\n\nL\nDONO\nSCAE\n\nRED\nSDURR SAR p D.\nU\n\nRU\n\n.\n\nI~\n\nTHU\nLN\n\nU\n\nRES\n\nr.\n\xc2\xb1ENN\nN\n\nDI ES S\n.\n\nLEARt DI\nU\n\nD\n\nOTH\n\n-0 ION EXCHA/GE COLU//V\n\n.\n\nFINISH\n\n.\n\n..\nA\n\nNSPECIFCATIONS\nRATNDEAT\n.....\n\nFigure 4-12.\n\nA.TLSE\nUP4\n\nIon Exchange Column\n\nC 11982\n\n/34POA\n\nof a mcuh smaller amount of salt which has to be removed in the ion\nexchange column.\nThe column is packaged with Biorad AG30W-x8 (Dowex 50W), 200 to\n400 mesh ion exchange resin. The resin is maintained between two Teflon\nfilters and held under compression by a Teflon coated retainer spring in\nthe inlet port of the IEC to minimize the dead volume in the outlet. The\nretainer spring also allows for expansion of the resin during column operation.\nAn external heater and temperature sensor are provided for temperature control during cruise (to prevent freezing of the H 2 0) and operation of the column.\n4. 3.4 Thermoelectric Cooler/Heat Pipe Assembly\nIn order to provide cooling of the derivatizer test cell to below 10 0 C\na thermoelectric cooler (TEC) will be utilized in conjunction with a heat\npipe as schematically illustrated in Figure 4-13. The proposed design is\nsimilar in concept to that employed in the VLBI instrument. Experience\ngained during development testing of the VLBI unit will permit the incorporation of minor design improvements to increase the efficiency of the\ncooler.\nThe cold side of the thermoelectric cooler is attached directly to the\nside of the test cell with a special conductive grease film coating at the\ninterface. Heat extracted from the test cell is transmitted from the hot\njunction side of the TEC to the upper instrument mounting plate by means\nof a heat pipe. The inherent insulative properties of the TEC will prevent\nany significant heat loss to the heat pipe when the test cell is heated during\nthe evaporation portion of the derivitization sequence.\nBoth the thermoelectric cooler and the heat pipe are static devices\nutilizing no moving parts. The TEC makes use of semi-conductor material\nproperties that initially were developed to convert thermal energy to electricity. Thus by reversing the operation and, applying an electrical potential across the semiconductor couple, the action is reversed and heat is\nforced from one side of the couple to the other. The heat pipe which in\nturn conducts the heat to the spacecraft structure, by means of the Lander\nmounting plate, consists of a tubular structure containing a capillary-wick\nanda smallamount of vaporizable fluid.\n\nThe heat pipe employs an essen-\n\ntially isothermal boiling condensing cycle with the capillary wick pumping the\ncondensate from the cool end of the "pipe" to the hot end where it is vaporized.\nThe heat trans ported is thusby means of the latent heat of vaporization which\nis many times greater than the heat that can be transferred in a conventional\nconduction system resulting in a large saving inweight and volume.\n4-50\n\nINSTRUMENT\nMOUNTING PLATE\n\nHEAT SINK\n\n\'COPPER\n\nHEAT PIPE\nDERIVITIZER\nTEST CELL\nWICK STRUCTURE\n\nTHERMAL\n\nCOPPER THERMAL COLLECTOR\n\nINSULATION\n\nTHERMOELECTRIC COUPLES\nFigure 4-13.\n\nThermoelectric Cooler/Heat Pipe Assembly\n\n4. 3. 5 Gas Chromatographic Column\nThe gas chromatographic column consists of a stainless steel\ncapillary tube coated internally with a liquid phase.\n\nIt must be maintained\n\nbelow a critical temperature (approximately 250 C) for amino acid condensation during sample injection and then temperature programmed at\nselected slew rates and within the specified temperature tolerance of\n+0. 5 C.\nThe flight design GC column consists of 200-feet by 0. 030-inch ID\ncapillary stainless steel tube temperature programmed from 25\n\nto 1700 C.\n\nThermal control is achieved by resistance heating of the stainless steel\ntube.\nThe design of the GC column shown in Figure 4-14 is the same\npresented in TRW\'s Final Report No.\n\n16660-6001-RU-00.\n\nThe dimensions\n\nshown in the GC column assembly drawings are actually based on 150 feet\nof 0. 024-inch ID tube.\n\nThe design can, of course, easily be modified to\n\naccommodate the 200 feet of 0. 030-inch-diameter tube which was used in\nthe breadboard GC column which has been described in previous sections.\nA detailed discussion of the design given in Section 3. 3. 7, page 3-199, of\nthe previous Final Report.\n4. 3. 6 Valves\nThe currently proposed valve concept is the result of our experience\nfrom the breadboard tests and of extensive valve and system studies.\n\nThe\n\ninitial valve concept was to use VLBI solenoid valves modified with tantalum\nfront end for reagent compatibility. Manually operated prototype solenoid\nvalve simulators were fabricated and tested in the breadboard.\n\nThe\n\nresults indicate that the final version of this valve is satisfactory for all\napplications except the derivatizer.\n\nThere the elastomeric,\n\ndynamic\n\npoppet shaft seal caused a high contamination background in the gas\nchromatogram.\n\nA split ring Teflon shaft seal was evaluated but excessive\n\nleakage into the valve cavity was experienced.\nIt was concluded the two options exists to solve the problem:\n1)\n\nProtect the magnetic components in the valve cavity with\na combination of gold plating and an improved Teflon\ndynamic seal.\n4-52\n\n?OLDOUT FRAME\n\nFOLDOUT FRAME\n\nis\n\nGOLD PLATE\n.001 THICK\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n1\n\n2\n\n(REF).0005 GOLD PLATE INTERNAL SURFACES\n\nALUMINUM ODDE\n\n.005 THICK\n(REF)\n7\n\nG\n7 .02 MELED O.D.\nEN IDo.00 WALL 150FT.(BIFILAR WOUND)\n\nBRAZE\n\nSECTION\n\nB-B\n\nSCALE 10Q/I\n\n4\nBRAZE\n\n2.G5\n\nFNE.250\n\n-BRAZE\n\nINLE\n\n.3\nS..250\n\nELTD\n\nB\'---4\nOUTILET\nSOLDER\nR\n\n1.88 DIA\n\nc\n10\n\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n\n1\n\n-16\n-15\n\nFITTING\nMOT\n\n-13\n\n-12\n-10\n-9\n-8\n-7\n\nBOOT\nTEFLON\nSRIN\nLEAD\n\'Z AWG COPPER\nLUG\nCOPPR\nSLEEVE\nCOPPER\nTERMINAL COPPER\nCOLUMN\n316 CRES TUBING\nOOL\n47LB\'\nFIBERFRAY\n\n-5\n\nFLANGE\n\n6061-\n\n-2\n\nCASE\n\nG-T\n\n-14\n\n-6\nB1\nT\n\n1\n\n316 RES\n\nBOOT\n\n51FIVE.\n\nII\n9\n8\n7 .\n\n47LWFT\'FBERA5\n6\nT\nAL\nL\n\nI\n\nASSEMBLY\n\nL\n\nORDRAWING\nA\n\nHEAT SHRINK IN PLACE\n\n[\n\nCOLUMN\n\nPOLISH EXTERNAL SURFACE\n\nABLDI\n\nNOTESUNLSS TMRWISESPEED\n\n8\n\n7\n\n6\n\n2\n\n5\n\nFigure 4-14.\n\n1\n\nGas Chromatographic\n\nColumn Assembly\n4-53\n\nDrawing\n\n2)\n\nIsolate the magnetic components in the valve cavity\nwith a Teflon or metallic diaphragm or bellows.\n\nThe first option, in the case of the wet chemistry instrument, does\nnot present a completely satisfactory solution because contamination of the\nreagents or sample due to even minor reactions cannot be tolerated. In\naddition, the reliability of valve operation is adversely affected to a significant degree by the probability of plating imperfections, resulting in\nexposure of the magnetic material and the subsequent generation of corrosion products which can readily impair actuation of the valve. The only\nreliable solution to this problem is to isolate the reagents from the\nmagnetic components of the solenoid actuator, and the tantalum diaphragm\nvalve concept was adopted for further design studies. The fabrication\ntechniques for forming diaphragms are well founded and only minimal\ndevelopment is anticipated.\nActuation of the diaphragm will require significantly higher forces\nthan are available with standard solenoids due to the relatively large\neffective areas of this device when pressurized.\n\nConsequently it is pro-\n\nposed to actuate the valve remotely by pneumatic pressure using small\nsolenoid pilot valves. A schematic layout of the proposed valve is shown\nin Figure 4-15.\n\nVarious methods will be studied to implement the alternate\n\npressurization and depressurization required to effect on-off operation.\nIn lieu of utilizing two valves on each diaphragm assembly, one to pressurize and one to vent, a scheme similar to that used on the VLBI vertical\nactuators is planned. As shown in Figure 4-16 each individual diaphragm\nassembly is controlled by its own valve in conjunction with either the\nmaster gas control valve to open or the master vent valve to effect closure.\nThus only two extra valves are required per system.\nThe proposed approach is to use the current VLBI solenoid valve\nfor gas control functions and as a pilot valve for suppling gas to actuate\nthe tantalum diaphragm valve, which offers total isolation of the solenoid\nvalve components from the sample and corrosive reagents.\nTo prove that the proposed design approach is reliable and fulfills\nall requirements TRW has proposed to NASA/ARC to build prototypes of\ngas actuated tantalum diaphragm valves and test them during the next\nphase of breadboard testing with the new baseline process.\n4-54\n\nIn addition,\n\nAD\n\nPISTON\n\n-\n\nPRESSURANT\n\nINLET AND\nOUTLET\n\nVALVE\nV/\n\nI\n/.\n\nRETAINER\nDIAPHRAGM\nSEAL\n\nPOPPET\n(TEFLON SEAT)\n\nDIAPHRAGM TYPF\nFigure 4-15.\n\nProposed Tantalum Diaphragm Valve Schematic\n\nvarious other methods should be studied,\n\nincluding bellows isolation\n\nmembers with both direct solenoid actuation and remote pneumatic\nactuation.\n4. 3. 7\n\nReagent Storage and Injection\nIt is\n\ncurrently planned to store the reagents in compatible metallic\n\ncontainers.\n\nThe layout of the proposed reagent injector is\n\nFigure 4-17.\n\nA gas actuated isolation valve is used to provide hermetic\n\nsealing of the container.\npunctured,\n\nshown in\n\nAfter the frangible disk at the outlet has been\n\nthe outlet is used for both pressurization and flow of the\n\nreagent to the processing cell.\n\nThe amount of reagent delivered to the\n\ncell is determined by the control valve open time.\nThis design is\n\na simplification of the concept used on VLBI, where\n\ninsertable glass containers are used for nutrient storage.\n\nThe dis-\n\nassembled VLBI nutrient injector is also shown in Figure 17.\nterm\n\nIf long\n\ncompatibility of the reagents in metallic containers proves to be a\n\nproblem, use of the VLBI type reagent injectors with glass ampoules\n\n4-55\n\nVLBI SOLENOID VALVES\n\nMASTER VENT VALVE (VBI SOLENOID VALVE)\nVENT\n\nHCARRIER\n\nGAS SUPPLY\n\nMASTER GAS CONTROL VALVE\n(VLBI SOLENOID VALVE)\n\nGAS ACTUATED TANTALUM VALVES WITH TEFLON\nSEATS\no\n\nINDIVIDUAL TANTALUM VALVE CONTROL ACHIEVED BY PROPER SEQUENCING OF VLBI SOLENOID\nVALVES TO SUPPLY AND VENT PRESSURIZING GAS\n\no THIS CONTROL SCHEME IS IDENTICAL TO THE ONE USED FOR THE VLBI TEST CELL POSITIONING\nMECHANISM VERTICAL ACTUATORS\nFigure 4-16.\n\nValve Actuation Diagram\n\nFILL\nPORT\n\nFsoti uOL\nvALve\n\nFigure 4-17.\n\nReagent Storage and Injection System and VLBI Nutrient Injector\n\nLong term compatibility test are proposed to evaluate\n\nmay be required.\n\nwhether reagent contamination or gas evolution results from reagent\nreaction with metallic containers.\n4. 3. 8 Gas Supply\nThe gas supply consists of two subsystems supplying oxygen to the\n(165 psia) to pressurize\n\nflame ionization detector; high pressure He/H\n\n2\n\nall gas activated tantalum diaphragm valves,\n\ngas actuated isolation valves\n\non the reagent containers and ion exchange column, and the gas actuated\nextractor cover plate; and finely regulated low pressure He/H\n\n2\n\n(18 psia)\n\nfor the gas chromatographic column and flame ionization detector, and\nfor the pressurization of the processing cells, for purging and gas drying,\nand for fluid routing and reagent injection.\nThe 02 supply system and the He/H\n\n2\n\ncarrier gas supply system\n\neach contain the following major components:\n*\n\nPressure vessel\n\n*\n\nIsolation valve\n\n*\n\nFilter\n\n*\n\nPressure regulator\n\n*\n\nFill valve\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nRelief valve\n\nThe He/H\n\n2\n\ncarrier gas and 02 supply system design is identical to\n\nthat for the VLBI instrument, with the exception of tank capacities and\nmaterials,\n\nand the use of two regulators instead of three.\n\nrier gas supply is shown in Figure 4-18.\n\nThe VLBI car-\n\nThe modular approach con-\n\nserves space, minimizes weight, and reduces the number of joints,\nthereby reducing potential leak paths. The gas supply assembly incorporates welded joints at component interfaces to minimize leakage.\nMetallic diaphragms are used in lieu of moving piston seals and the use\nof isolation valves prevents pressurization of the system over long\nperiods.\nThe first stage regulator was selected for simplicity to provide the\n165 psia actuation pressure for the Hz/He system.\n\nThe design incor-\n\nporates a Ni-Span-C corrugated diaphragm as a sensing unit.\n\n4-58\n\nNi-Span-C\n\nFigure 4-18.\n\nGas Supply System\n\nwas selected to minimize thermal effects on the spring rate of the sensing\nunit.\n\nA spherical poppet and plastic seat make up the valve portion of the\n\nregulator.\n\nThe poppet is a 1-millimeter tungsten carbide ball.\n\nThe seat\n\nis polyimide, Vespel SP-l, selected to obtain the sealing properties of an\nelastomer combined with the stability of a hard seat.\nThe second stage regulator is designed similarly, but with a much\nhigher sensitivity.\n\nOutlet pressure is closely regulated to meet the resolu-\n\ntion requirements of the gas chromatographic column.\n\nBecause of the\n\nlower pressure, the diaphragm spring rate has been reduced in order to\nobtain as precise a regulated flow as possible.\nsurfaces and requires no lubrication.\n\nThe regulator has no sliding\n\nThe only metal-to-metal contacts\n\nare the diaphragm guide and the poppet seat.\n\nThe guide maintains poppet-\n\nto-seat concentricity and supports the diaphragm assembly against lateral\nshock and vibration forces.\n\nRegulation is anticipated to be less than\n\n2 percent.\nThe 02 supply system uses the same first and second stage regulators to control the flow of oxygen into the flame ionization detector.\nThe tanks are pressurized through the fill valve in gradual stages to\nprevent overheating. External cooling is usually required to produce\npressurization in a reasonable time and to minimize the number of fatigue\ncycles.\n\nGenerally, convection cooling with cool air or CO2 is effective.\n\nThe fill valve consists of an AM 355 housing, tungsten carbide poppet, and\n4-59\n\na polyimide (Vespel SP-1) seat.\n\nA piece of ground support equipment is\nA probe is used to\n\ninstalled on the threaded fitting using an O-ring seal.\nunseat the poppet and allow the tank to be filled.\n\nRemoval of the probe\n\nresults in the poppet returning to the seat by means of a follower spring.\nThe poppet is then pressure-loaded closed as the supply pressure is\ndecreased.\n\nSubsequently,\n\nthe inlet tube is welded shut, effecting a\n\nredundant, positive seal for the long term storage.\n\nThis item is in pro-\n\nduction at this time.\nA test port is located between the isolation valve and the filter at\nthe regulator inlet.\ntional tests.\n\nThis port is used to pressurize the system for func-\n\nThe tube is sealed by the same process as the fill tube.\n\nThe utilization of the flame ionization detector as the baseline\ndetector has significantly affected the selection of materials from which\nthe pressure supply tanks will be fabricated.\n\nInconel 718, the selected\n\nmaterial for the VLBI, although satisfactory for helium, is not considered\ncompatible with hydrogen because of embrittlement.\n\nHydrogen embrittle-\n\nment occurs through a process identified in conjunction with high pressure\nvessels and is most severe at room temperature.\n\nIt can be distinguished\n\nfrom the more common effects of stress corrosion by:\n\n(1) ionic hydrogen\n\nin interstitial solution in the metal lattice, and (2) gaseous hydrogen surrounding a nucleating and advancing crack front.\n\nThese characteristics\n\nhave subsequently been described as "hydrogen- environment embrittlement.\n\nIts general characteristics are:\na)\n\nThe effect is one of embrittlement and only when in a\nhydrogen environment.\n\nb)\n\nIt is a surface effect.\n\nc)\n\nIt is an immediate effect.\n\nd)\n\nIt is a function of hydrogen pressure.\n\ne)\n\nThe effect is not increased by temperature.\n\nThe combination of these effects is to embrittle the exposed surface\nto a limited-finite thickness.\n\nThis surface layer cannot, as a consequence,\n\nunder plastic deformation to the same degree as it can in air.\n\n4-60\n\nFor a\n\nsusceptible metal, an existing crack or one formed through pressurization in\nanhydrogen environment will propogate at a lower stress level and at a\nmore rapid rate than in an inert environment, even at low pressures\nbelow 14. 7 psia.

The use of welded joints and the\n4500 psi.\n\nisolation valve in the supply line will insure a long-term leak-tight\nassembly.\n4. 3. 9 Gas Chromatographic Column Detector\nThe baseline detector proposed for the flight instrument is still the\nflight version of a hydrogen flame ionization detector (HYFID) developed\nunder NASA Contract NAS2-5469. TRW has conducted tests with a protoptype unit under simulated flight instrument conditions to establish and\nverify operating parameters for satisfactory performance. The results\nof these tests and a detailed description of the design are incorporated\nin TRW\'s Final Report No. 16660-6001-RO-00.\n\nNo new information on\n\nthe HYFID detector has been accumulated since then.\n\nA drawing of the\n\nflight version of the detector is shown in Figure 4-19.\nUse of a state-of-the-art electron capture is also considered and it\nis suggested that an electron capture detector will be evaluated with\nrespect to sensitivity, linearity, and response to interfering substances.\nThere are several reasons for evaluating an electron capture detector.\nThe most important reason is that some of the interfering material\n4-61\n\n2\n\n1.00\nCAPILLARY CHAMBER\nVENT\n\nHEATER IGNITOR\nIGNITION INDICATOR\nTHERMOCOUPLE\nSENSOR\nCATHODE -\n\n1.90\n\nINSULATED\nJET TIP\n\nOXYGEN\nGAS INLET\n\n1.00\nHYDROGEN/HELIUM\nGAS INLET\n\nFig. 4-19.\n\nELECTROMETER\nRECEPTACLE\n\nFlame Ionization Detector\n\nobserved by flame ionization detection may be less sensitive to electron\ncapture detection and hence an improved signal to background ratio might\nbe obtained.\n\nElectron capture detection might also offer some design\nsimplifications, especially if the instrument were used in conjunction with\na mass spectrometer.\nThe use of an electron capture detector would require certain modifications to the instrument system in the following areas: The electronic\nsubsystem needs to be modified in the front end of the analog data system\nto adapt to the particular detector finally chosen. The hydrogen admixture\nin the carrier gas would not be required and pure He could be used. The\noxygen for the flame ionization detector would be replaced by the electron\ncapture gas which would be nitrogen or an argon/methane mixture.\nFinally the methylene chloride would have to be replaced by ether as a\nsolvent for the trifluoroacetic anhydride used in the derivatizer.\n\n4-62\n\nAnother alternative which is currently under study by TRW under\nNASA/ARC Contract No. NAS2-7695 is incorporating the Viking 75 GCMS\nMass Spectrometer into the wet chemistry instrument.

Also, system\nheaters and valves are operated directly off of the raw bus to eliminate\nconversion efficiency losses.\n\nThe electronic subsystem power is pres-\n\nently estimated at 4. 6 watts continuous.\n4.4. 1 Command Processing\nCommands issued to the instrument from the GCSC have a serial\n24-bit word structure. The commands, which are shifted into the instrument with a GCSC clock, are bracketed by a Command Enable signal.\nThe rise of the Command Enable is used to power up the Command Processor and the falling edge triggers the command decoding circuitry.\nUpon activation of the decoding circuitry, the processor checks\nthe last 12 bits of the command for odd parity (the first 12 bits are discarded). If the command passes parity check, the command is executed\nand is stored in the memory.\n\nIf the parity test is not passed, the instru-\n\nment loads the command directly into the memory without executing it.\nA simplified block diagram of the Command Processor is shown in\nFigure 4-22.\nThe required instrument commands that have been identified are\nThe Command Processor is not limited to the following\nlist and can be easily expanded to meet any requirement.\nlisted below.\n\nCommand Function\n\nCommand Number\n1\n\nDump Memory\n\n2\n\nActivate Thermal IV\'s\n\n3\n\nDistribute Soil\n\n4\n\nAccess Sequencer\n\n5\n\nAnalysis No. 2\n\n6\n\nAnalysis No. 3\n\n7\n\nFlight Status Activation\n4-66\n\nINTERNAL CLOCK\n\nCOMMAND ENABLE\n\nCOMMAND\n\n,\n\nCONTROLLER\n\nPARITY\nCHECK\n\nCOMMAND SHIFT PULSI\n\nSERIAL COMMANDS\n\nI\nCOMMAND\nRECEIVERREGISTER\n\nTO MEMORY\nINPUT BUFFER\n\nCOMMAND\nDECODER\n\nCOMMANDS TO INSTRUMENT\n\nFigure 4-22.\nCommands\n\nSerial Command Processor Block Diagram\n\n1, 2 and 3 are self-explanatory.\n\nCommand 4 allows\n\naccess to any step within the sequence thus providing commandable\nThe fifth and sixth commands identify which analysis\nCommand 7 is\nto be run with the first analysis as the default mode.\n\nsequence changes.\nis\n\nused to insure all latching relays and valves are in the correct flight\nconfiguration.\n4.4.2\n\nMemory\nThe instrument will contain a solid-state MOS buffer memory capa-\n\nble of storing 2048 bits of data.\n\nThe memory size (identical to VLBI)\n\nrepresents a reasonable compromise between instrument power and\nWith the instrument running at its maxilander data rate compatibility.\nmum data taking mode, a data transfer to the DAPU will only be required\napproximately once every 1.5 minutes.\n\nAlthough the transfer rate is\n\nwell within the capability of the present lander, the instrument memory\nsize can easily be expanded or contracted if required by 79\' mission\nconstraints.\n\n4-67\n\nThe 16-bit word\n\nThe memory is organized into 128 16-bit words.\n\nstructure contains 12 data bits, 3 identification bits and a parity bit.\nThe data output formatting contains the required sync and identification\nwords as required by the lander and is completely compatible with the\nDAPU hardware and software.\nA block diagram of the memory is shown in Figure 4-23.\n\nData are\n\nwritten into the memory when either the Command Processor or A/D\nConverter sends the memory an Access Request signal.

The supply combines a\nswitching ripple regulator with a thermal control circuit. The thermal\ncontrol circuit is used to sense the temperature of the derivatizer and to\nturn the TE supply on or off to maintain a predetermined temperature.\nBy controlling the supply directly, we are able to reduce the efficiency\nlosses due to external cooler power switching.\n4.4.9 Mechanical Packaging Design\nThe mechanical design of the electronic subsystem affords low\ndesign cost, low manufacturing cost, ease of component replacement and\nexcellent flexibility to incroporate development circuit design changes.\nThe component to volume ratio is such that circuits may be added,\nchanged or deleted as required during the development phase without\ncausing a major design cost impact.\nof 10 percent for the package.\n\nThere is a growth factor allowance\n\nThe preliminary design is to have the\n\npower supply and regulating circuits on one circuit board, 60 percent of\nthe flat packs on one board, and the signal conditioning circuits on three\ncircuit boards. The board placement is such that one additional flat\npack or signal conditioning board may be added.\n\nAll circuit boards are\n\nmulti-layered to reduce size and thus the weight of the instrument. The\ninitial component count is 1160. The volume allocated to the electrical\nsubsystem is 11.6 by 10.75 by 4.5 inches.\nThe packaging design will be similar to that in VLBI.\n\nThe boards\n\nwill be mounted in machined housings and interconnected by an ESS/MSS\nharness. Internal wiring between boards located in the same housing will\nbe done by flex cable.\n\nEMI shields will be used between housing for\n\nminimizing circuit cross-talk and interference problems.\nHigh density Cannon "Golden D" connectors will be used for internal\ninstrument (ESS to MSS) wiring and the Viking standard connectors for\nlander interface.\nThe present estimated weight of the electronic subsystem and\ninterconnect harness is 9 pounds.\n\n4-78\n\n5.\n\nCONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS\n\nTRW believes that the breadboard study program reported herein has\nclearly demonstrated the feasibility of an automated wet chemistry instrument for the isolation and measurement of amino acids and their optical\nisomer ratios at the nanomole level within the constraints of the weight,\npower, volume and other lander interface specifications.\n\nThe performance\n\nof the critical components of the design has been demonstrated with a\nprototype breadboard whose design duplicated as closely as practicable all\naspects of the flight design which might affect the instrument capabilities,\nincluding internal cell geometry, interconnecting valves and plumbing,\nmaterials exposed to the reagents,\n\nsequencing,\n\nand vent pressures.\n\nCon-\n\nceptual designs and design adaptions of Viking Lander Biology Instrument\nhardware have been prepared for the remaining components required to\nsupport the analysis.\n\nThese include gas supplies, reagent injectors and\n\nthe thermoelectric cooler/heat pipe assembly.\nThe breadboard testing was carried out with Process No.\n\nI which\n\nuses acid hydrolysis directly on the soil, rather than the new baseline\nProcess No.\n\n2 in which hydrolysis is performed on a water extract of the\n\nsoil, but the overall processes are similar, and Process No.\n\n2 does not\n\nhave any operations that are significantly different from the operations in\nProcess No.\n\n1.\n\nFurthermore,\n\nProcess No. 2 is\n\nsignificantly simpler,\n\nand certain problems did arise from interferences in Process No.\n\ni which\n\nwill be eliminated or greatly reduced with the baseline Process No. 2.\nSome processing problems still remain, but we feel that although further\nstudy is\n\nrequired, solutions for these problems can be obtained within the\n\ncontext of a breadboard study program.\nWe recommend that to continue the orderly development of this instrument that the wet chemistry instrument breadboard fabricated and tested\nin this study be redesigned,\n\nrefurbished and modified for optimum use\n\nwith the new baseline Process No.\n\n2,\n\nand that additional testing be carried\n\nout to solve the remaining interference problems and to demonstrate the\nperformance of the instrument with the new baseline process.\nThe test program should include the following tasks:\n\ni)\n\nlaboratory\n\ntests to evaluate process modifications developed by NASA/ARC and to\n5-1\n\nestablish prototype instrument operating conditions for the revised process;\n2) evaluation of filter requirements and filter materials for the baseline\nProcess No. 2; 3) identification of the source of and solution of the interference problem with the derivatizer; 4) investigation of the use of a stateof-the-art electron capture detector in place of/or in addition to the flame\nionization detector, especially in regard to their relative sensitivities for\ninterferences; 5) step-by-step evaluation of the performance of each breadboard component for its function in the process sequence, and laboratory\ntests in glassware for control analyses; 6) breadboard performance demonstration tests with radiotracers, NASA/ARC supplied soils and amino\nacid-free soils; and finally, 7) revision of the flight design concept based\nupon the breadboard program results.\n\n5-2\n\nAPPENDIX\n\nProcessing Sequence No.\n\n1 - used for all breadboard tests (from\n\nNASA/ARC Specification A-16231,\n\nRev 1, Jan. 4,\n\n1972).\n\nExperiment Sequence - The following is a typical experiment\nThe reagent volumes are given for a 1 cubic centimeter soil\nsequence.\nsample.\n\nDerivatization assumes one (1) micromole of each of the protein\n\namino acids for the reagent volumes.\nStep 1.\n\nPlace a 1 cubic centimeter soil sample in a chamber.\n\nStep 2.\n\nAdd 7.5 milliliters of 6N HC1 (aqueous).\n\nStep 3.\n\nHeat to 1100C in closed chamger for 16 hours.\n\nStep 4.\n\nFilter off the insoluble soil residue.\n\nStep 5.\n\nWash the soil residue with 5 milliliters of water and\nfilter off the soil residue.\n\nStep 6.\n\nThe amino acids and dissolved salts in HC1 (Combined\nfiltrates from steps 4 and 5) are then evaporated to\ndryness.\n\nStep 7.\n\nAfter evaporating to dryness (final heat at 100 0 C),\ndissolve the amino acids in 10 milliliters of water.\n(It may be necessary to heat a short time to assure\nsolution. )\n\nStep 8.\n\n0\nAllow to cool to below 35 C.
