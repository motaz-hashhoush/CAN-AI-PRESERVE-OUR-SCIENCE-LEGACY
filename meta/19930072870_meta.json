Later, when a few B-747's were used to carry portable air quality monitoring equipment for the Global Air Sampling Program (GASP), scientists at NASA-Lewis explored ways in which these digital values could be used to label data collected during the GASP flights. Digital values of GASP analyses were recorded along with digital values of location and altitude, time, winds, and temperature, obtained by microprocessors from within the host aircraft's avionics. These data suggested a way in which manually recorded in-flight meteorological reports could be replaced by an automatic system, which could record winds and air temperatures as often as desired. NASA's prototype ASDAR showed that automated data relay by meteorological geostationary satellites could be accomplished from an aircraft. Testing of the instruments and analyses of its data are examined.", "title": "An operational ASDAR system", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-16T02:59:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19930072870, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Sparkman, James K., Jr."}, "organization": {"name": "National Environmental Satellite Service", "location": "Washington, DC, United States"}}, "id": "f4635f268a2e4f888fe04c0b0f8b97b2"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19930072870, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Smidt, George J."}, "organization": {"name": "National Weather Service", "location": "Washington, DC., United States"}}, "id": "801dbde005024e1d9100a48072e76bad"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-09-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19930072870, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19930072870, "id": "26f9193127074e148f99bde9f08039ca", "publicationName": "NASA.
