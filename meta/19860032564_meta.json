Facilities cannot be operated in isolation, however, and must have transportation for access. This is particularly true for space facilities. In order to attain the goal of permanent presence in space, the Space Station and its low altitude platforms must be developed and operated with transportation for routine access to and from the earth; local transportation between the Space Station, its platforms, and other low altitude satellites; and long-range transportation between low and geostationary orbits, and escape orbits. In addition, geostationary facilities and habitation elements must also be developed. It is in such an assembly of space facilities and transportation elements that will be vested the capabilities to service the earth, establish bases on the moon or planets, and eventually move beyond.", "title": "Introduction - The space infrastructure", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PROCEEDINGS", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-12T19:03:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19860032564, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Bekey, I."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Office of Space Flight", "location": "Washington, DC, United States"}}, "id": "e2a53797e8fa4df0a6f5bb23c8bf0e1c"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Proceedings", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-18T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19860032564, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19860032564, "id": "f125f81ed844416890fa63cc9a52f7d3", "publicationDate": "1985-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
