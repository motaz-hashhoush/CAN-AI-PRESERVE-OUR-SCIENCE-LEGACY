The method is based on the fact that, for a test specimen of fixed crack size under constant rate, the initiation J-integral may be established from the crack size itself, the actual external load and load-point displacement at growth initiation, and the relaxation modulus of the viscoelastic solid, without knowledge of the complete test record. Since crack size alone, of the required data, would be unknown at each point of the load-vs-load-point displacement curve of a single-specimen test, an expression is derived to estimate it. With it, the physical J-integral at each point of the test record may be established. Because of its basis on single-specimen testing, not only does the method not require the use of multiple specimens with differing initial crack sizes, but avoids the need for tracking crack growth as well.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 20010068924, "id": "9cb8461df729498ea2838d017024c3be", "publicationDate": "2001-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20010068924.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20010068924/downloads/20010068924.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20010068924/downloads/20010068924.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20010068924/downloads/20010068924.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
