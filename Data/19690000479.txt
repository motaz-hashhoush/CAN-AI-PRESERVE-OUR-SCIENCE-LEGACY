Folded Stick Module Open Configuration\n\n\t\n\nThe problem:\n\nTo develop a high-density integrated circuit (IC)\nmodule packaging technique for use in industrial\noperations that require the fabrication and assembly\nof compact circuitry configurations, such as those\nused in the central processing units of computers.\nThe solution:\n\n\t\n\n\t\nIC modules can now be compactly assembled into\nshort-run complex electronic assemblies by mount- \t\n\t\ning them on a "Stick" module. This module is an\n\t\nelongated flat member with terminals on one face to\n\t\nhich leads of IC flatpacks can be mounted, and an\n\nopposite face to which interconnections can be made\nbetween IC flatpacks by running wires from terminal\nto terminal.\nA logical extension of this original Stick module is\na similar one of higher density, which consists of\ntwo sections molded of polypropylene plastic, known\nas the "Folded Stick" module. This module provides\na method of high-density packaging for industrial\noperations that require the fabrication and assembly\nof physically compact circuitry configurations. The\nFolded Stick module has integral flexible hinges extending longitudinally along the two sections joining\nthem together so that they can be folded upon one\n(continued overleaf)\n\nNNW\n\nThis document was prepared under the sponsorship of the National\nAeronautics and Space Administration. Neither the United States\nGovernment nor any person acting on behalf of the United States\n\nGovernment assumes any liability resulting from the use of the\ninformation contained in this document, or warrants that such use\nwill be free from privately owned rights.\n\nanother. The folded-over sections are held in place by\na clasping arrangement consisting of integrally molded\nmating male and female protrusions along opposite\nedges of the sections. In the unfolded position insulated magnet wire interconnections can be made as\non the original Stick module by welding from terminal to terminal on the inner plane of each of the sections; in addition, interconnections can be made between terminals on both sections. When the sections\nare folded, the interconnections are completely\nhidden within the module. Flatpack IC modules subsequently soldered by their leads to the web terminals\non the outside planes of the sections can be replaced without disturbing the hidden interconnections.\n\nHow it\'s done:\nThe IC modules are located on a foldable flat layout making it possible to separate the attachment\nterminals and the IC interconnections. This invention\nprovides a method of high density IC module packaging. The Folded Stick module in an open configuration with wire interconnections completed is shown\nin figure 1. It is shown in a closed configuration with\nthe clasping members engaged with the wire connections hidden within the module in figure 2. A manufacturing drawing of the module is given in figure 3.\nThe advantages of using the Folded Stock module\ninclude the following: the wiring is protected within\nthe fold forming a self-contained mold in which the\nwiring can be encapsulated; the component density of\na system is improved, a density of thirty 14-lead IC\'s\n\nper cubic inch being possible with relatively little\ndensity being lost in the subsystem for packaging;\na very simple back panel can be used to combine many\nof these modules into the electronic system; only a\none-sided printed circuit board is needed; and the\ntotal number of terminals required for the complete\nelectronic system can be reduced as a result of the\nnumber of interconnections that can be made between\nthe two sections, thus improving reliability.\n\n.\n\nNotes:\n1. This invention could be of interest to designers\nand manufacturers of computer hardware and\nmobile communication equipment.\n2. No additional documentation is available for this\nTech Brief.\n3.
