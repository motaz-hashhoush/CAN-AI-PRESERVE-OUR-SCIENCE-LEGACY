A solution could be to\nuse satellites to complete the cellular coverage for\nlarge regions having a low traffic density. The\ngeostationnary orbit shows some limitations for\nsuch missions (big antennas, large propagation\ndelays ...); others solutions based on low earth\norbit (LEO) or intermediate circular orbit (ICO)\nare proposed.\nHowever, the choice of such constellation\n\nABSTRACT\nDesigning a mobile satellite system entails\nmany complex trade-offs between a great number\nof parameters including: capacity, complexity of\nthe payload, constellation geometry, number of\nsatellites, quality of coverage ...\nThis paper aims at defining a methodology\nwhich tries to split the variables to give rapidly\nsome first results.\nThe major input considered is tile traffic\nassumption which would be offered by the system.\nA first key step is the choice of the best\nRider or Walker constellation geometries - with\ndifferent numbers of satellites - to insure a good\nquality of coverage over a selected service area.\nAnother aspect to be addressed is the\npossible altitude location of the constellation, since\nit is limited by many constraints. The "altitude\nranges that seem appropriate considering the\nspatial environment, the launch and orbit keeping\npolicy and the feasibility of the antenna allowing\nsufficient frequency reuse are briefly analysed.\nTo support these first considerations, some\n"reference constellations" with similar coverage\nquality are chosen. The in-orbit capacity needed to\nsupport the assumed traffic is computed versus\naltitude.\nFinally, the exact number of satellite is\ndetermined. It comes as an optimum between a\nsmall number of satellites offering a high (and\ncostly) power margin in bad propagation situation\nand a great number of less powerful satellites\ngranting the same quality of service.\n\nparameters (number of satellites, altitude,\ninclination angle ...) is difficult because depending\non a lot of interleaved variables.\nThe scope of our study is to propose a\nsimple first optimization method which takes into\naccount the major constraints for a decoupled\nchoice of each of the constellation parameters.\n\nTRAFFIC\n\nSeveral hypothesis sustain the analysis:\n- The service is a mobile satellite voice\ntelecommunication service compatible with\nhandset terminals.\n- The quality shall be nearly the same than for\ncellular voice systems in term of availability, the\nterminal will weight less than 600g, and have an\nautonomy of approximatively 1 hour in active\nmode and around 10 hours in sleeping mode.\n- The bandwith available is nearly 10 MHz in L\nband for the mobile return link and nearly 10 MHz\nin S band for the mobile forward link.\nThe number of subscriber and their\n\nINTRODUCTION\nThe market recorded a few years ago a\nlarge increase of interest in mobile\ncommunications.\nThe first systems were analogic terrestrial\nsystems with low capacity and low coverage area.\n\nASSUMPTION\n\nrepartition has an important impact on this\noptimization. As an example, the calculation is\n\nI63\n\nconducted\nhere on the basis of the inputs stated in\nthe FCC filings [1].\n\nThe method leads to an optimization\nof\neach of these 3 points separately in order to\nminimise the cost of the mission for the service\n\nSATELLITE\n\nrequired. For a first approach of this problem, only\nthe most important constraints are taken into\naccount for the optimization\nof each parameter\n(figure 1). Further comparisons\naround these\nsolutions would of course be needed to validate\nand refine the results.\n\nCONSTELLATIONS\n\nThe technical litterature describes a great\nof satellite constellations,\nwith elliptical or\norbits, polar or inclined, different ways to\nthe satellites into planes ...\nIn term of quality of coverage, the studies\n\nnumber\ncircular\ndispose\n\nThe first study is on the constellation\ngeometry which is chosen to provide the best\n\nRIDER OR WALKER CONSTELLA"I10N OPT1MIZATION\n\nTRAFRCASSUMPTION\n\nq\n\n-_\n\n]\n\n- q OEOM ,O."ECO..TEL .,,ON\n\nORBIT KEEPING\n\nSERVICE AREA\n\nl\n\nTERMINAL SIZE & WEIGHT\n\nALTITUDE\n\nTOTAL NUMBER OF SATELLITES\n\nfigure 1: Constellation optimization methodology\n\nof Rider\n\n[2], Beste,\n\nWalker\n\n[3], Luders\n\nquality of coverage for the desired regions.
