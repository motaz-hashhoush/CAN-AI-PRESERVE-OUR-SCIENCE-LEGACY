These estimated handling qualities have been compared with existing Army-Navy and CAA requirements for stability and control. The results of the analysis indicate that the Martin model 202 airplane will possess satisfactory handling qualities in all respects except possibly in the following: The amount of elevator control available for landing or maneuvering in the landing condition is either marginal or insufficient when using the adjustable stabilizer linked to the flaps . Moreover, indications are that the longitudinal trim changes will be neither large nor appreciably worse with a fixed stabilizer than with the contemplated arrangement utilizing the adjustable stabilizer in an attempt to reduce the magnitude of the trim changes caused by flap deflection.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 20050019466, "id": "b63c1962d4844dd5a8f01bf56a9ee342", "publicationDate": "1947-01-24T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20050019466.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20050019466/downloads/20050019466.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20050019466/downloads/20050019466.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20050019466/downloads/20050019466.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
