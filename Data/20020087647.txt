b'Public\nSafety\n\n"Until the late 1970s)airline crew training was\nfocused on stick-and-rudder skills, the physical\nskills needed to fly an airplane," says United\nAirlines training coordinator Cliff Lawson.\n"Training in crew coordination or teamwork\nskills was almost unheard of. By the late seventies, however, the airline industry and United\nin particular began to realize that the vast\nmajority of accidents and incidents were taking\nplace in airplanes that were flyable. In many\ncases, there was absolutely nothing wrong with\nthe airplane."\nWhat was wrong was human error, surveys\nshowed; statistics indicated that mistakes were\ncausing far more accidentslincidents than\nmechanical malfunctions. Among the most\ncommon human errors, researchers found, was\nfailure on the part of crew members to communicate properly and failure to use resources\nreadily available to them. These and many\nother breakdowns of cockpit management and\nteamwork sparked a major change in airline\nflight and simulator training wherein the focus\nshifted to programs intended to improve teamwork and coordination in the cockpit.\nAmes Research Center, a pioneer and world\nleader in human factorsresearch aimed at greater\nunderstanding of aircrew capabilities and limitations, played a principal role in developing\ntwo interdependenttraining programs that concentrate on more effective aircrew operations.\nThe first is Cockpit Resource Management,\nor CRM, which by one definition is "the effective utilization of all available resources hardware, software and liveware -to achieve\nsafe, efficient flight operations." Hardware\nincludes the aircraft\'s on-board systems; software embraces operating manuals, bulletins,\ncharts and other information; liveware is people,\nincluding air traffic controllers and other "resources" not on board. CRM defines a number\nof areas for focus in lectures and simulation\n\nAirline\nCrew\nTraining\n\ntraining, such as decision making, establishment of priorities for cockpit attention, cockpit\nworkload distribution, making most effective\nuse of available information, avoiding distractions, developing intracockpit communication\nskills and, for the pilot in command, establishing firm leadership that nonetheless encouragesparticipation and critiqueby subordinates.\nAmes\' Aerospace Human Factors Research\nDivision began CRM development in the latter\n1970s and - in 1979 - sponsored the first\nCRM workshop, which brought together airline and government aviation interests to\naddress the problems of human error.\nAmajor result of that workshopwas United\nAirlines\' initiation, with NASA help, of a multifaceted CRM training program. Many other\ncarriers adopted the United program and still\nothers developed their own approaches, again\nwith NASA assistance. Atypical comment, from\nCaptain Reuben Black, chairman of Delta Airlines\' CRM Steering Committee: "NASA has\nbeen a tremendous help to us...The staff of\nAmes Research Center have been very influential in the development of our CRM program."\nIn top left photo is a Delta CRM session.\nAmes also played a leadership role in the\ndevelopment and airline adoption of a CRMrelated program known as LOlT, for Line Oriented Flight Training, in which crews fly complete missions in high fidelity simulators that\nsimulate "real world" conditions as closely as\npossible. In photo far left is United Airlines\'\nLOFT simulator; at left is a view from the simulator cockpit of a realistic final approach.\nIn LOFT training, instructors induce emergency situations whose successful handling\ndemands coordinated actions of all crew members. The entire simulated flight, conducted in\nreal time, is video-taped for later review; at\nright, a United captain and first officer (seated)\ngo over their tape with their simulator check\n\npilot. "This self critique is one of the most\nvaluable facets of CRM training," says United\nAirlines\' Lawson. "It allows an individual pilot\nto see himself as others see him and consequently to observe how his individual operating style affects other crew members."\n"LOlT is a learning experience in which\nerrors are usually made," according to two of\nthe leading CRM researchers, Dr. H. Clayton\nFoushee, formerly of NASA-Ames, and NASA\nconsultant Dr. Robert L. Helmreich of The\nUniversity of Texas at Austin, in their chapter\nof the book Human Factors in Aviation."\n"However, since effective group function in\nthis environment is by definition the management of human error, LOFT provides highly\neffective crew coordination training."\nNASA continues to conduct or support\nresearch to improve CRMILOFT training. In\n1986, Ames - jointly with the USAF Military\nAirlift Command - sponsored a second CRM\nworkshop. Under a NASA grant, The University\nof Texas at Austin, with participation by several\nairlines and some military units, is collecting\ndata on CRMILOET; the intent is to help users\nmeasurethe before-and-aftereffects of resource\nmanagement training as an aid to enhancing\ntheir CRM programs.\nO Copyright 1988 by Academic hess, Inc.\n\n'
