b"Space Exploration\n\nA Presentation for Mulberry Merit Badge Day\nMitzi Adams\nNASA/MSFC\nDecember 10, 2016\n\nA Brief History of Rockets\n- c. 300 B.C.E. Archytas the Greek flew model pigeon propelled by water vapor\n- c. 100 C.E. Chinese filled hollow pieces of bamboo with gunpowder\n- c. 1232 Chinese used rockets as weapons\n- c. 1690 Sir Isaac Newton composed the three laws of physics that quantify how and why\nrockets work.\n1. An object in motion will stay in motion unless acted on by an unbalanced force. An\nobject at rest will stay at rest unless acted on by an unbalanced force. Law of Inertia\n2. Acceleration is produced when a force acts on a mass. a=F/m\n3. For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.\n- 1898 Konstantin Tsiolkovsky proposed idea of exploring space using rockets\n1903 published Exploration of the Universe with Rocket Propelled Vehicles\nWernher von Braun read Tsiolkovsky\n- 1926 Robert Goddard successfully launched a liquid-fueled rocket\n- 1940s Wernher von Braun used the V-2 rocket in warfare against England\n\nHistory -- continued\nOctober 4, 1957 -- Sputnik I launched, 83.6 kg (I am about 50 kg)\n\nScientific Purpose: Measure atmospheric density and propagation of\nradio waves in ionosphere\n\nListen!
