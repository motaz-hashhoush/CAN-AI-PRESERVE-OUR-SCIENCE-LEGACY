Originally developed for the BioSentinel CubeSat\nmission to study the response of a wild type and mutant strain of\nyeast to the deep space environment, the BioSensor consists of a\nseries of 16-well, independently plumbed fluidics cards. The cards\nutilize filters to allow the fluidic system to administer reagents while\nconstraining the microbes in their wells. Heaters on each card incubate\nto the appropriate growth temperature once the experiment begins.\nDuring the active experiment, the LED/detector system measures the\ntransmission of light through each well at three specific wavelengths,\nsimilar to a standard benchtop spectrophotometer. The transmission/\nabsorbance kinetics curves for each well are telemetered back to\nEarth, along with temperature data, for analysis on the ground. The\nBioSensor is being upgraded from its original CubeSat free-flyer\ninterface to be a secondary payload on lunar landers, Gateway, and\nother BLEO applications, while maintaining the same functionality and\nscience utility for future experiments.", "isLessonsLearned": true, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 20210015336, "id": "8eba4d59ba3f4821bd11d36dd661b451", "publicationDate": "2021-05-14T07:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "BioSensor Users Guide 05-10-21.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20210015336/downloads/BioSensor%20Users%20Guide%2005-10-21.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20210015336/downloads/BioSensor%20Users%20Guide%2005-10-21.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20210015336/downloads/BioSensor%20Users%20Guide%2005-10-21.pdf.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
