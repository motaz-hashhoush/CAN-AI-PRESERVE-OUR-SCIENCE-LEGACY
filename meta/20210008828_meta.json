The technology demonstration goals to achieve precision photometry via arcsecond-level line-of-sight pointing error and highly stable focal plane temperature control were met by February 2018. Extended mission operations are ongoing, with the primary focus on observing nearby stars for transiting exoplanets. Throughout development and operations, the roles of mission assurance and fault protection have proven critical to achieving the primary technical goals and to maintaining a healthy spacecraft through multiple extended missions. Given the budget and schedule constraints typical of a CubeSat, innovative tailoring of processes has been critical to success throughout both development and operations of ASTERIA. Mission assurance plays an important role in identifying and evaluating risk and developing cost-effective mitigations. Flexibility in the fault protection design offers a variety of options for implementing risk mitigations as risks have been uncovered both in pre-delivery testing and in mission operations. This paper will discuss the approach taken on ASTERIA to implement mission assurance and fault protection and the resulting benefits to operational efficiency and success. It will briefly address the advantages of this approach during development, in which the combination of the roles provided mission assurance significant insight to system risks, which feeds back into testing methodologies and directly into fault protection design. Operations will be discussed in detail. During this phase, the roles merge to identify in-flight fault protection updates to efficiently respond to anomalies and improve the likelihood of successful technology demonstrations. The paper will also detail the tools that are used to analyse data, identify anomalies, and develop the updates to uplink to the spacecraft. Finally, the general operational approach will be discussed to highlight the usefulness of the ASTERIA processes and their applicability to future CubeSat missions.", "title": "ASTERIA Operations Demonstrates the Value of Combining the Mission Assurance and Fault Protection Roles on CubeSats", "stiType": "PREPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20210008828, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Knapp, Mary"}}, "id": "0145dc554af14bbcb83c36d640b3cd33"}, {"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20210008828, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Campuzano, Brian"}}, "id": "5b0ddc49c7144924b06e80ae7f29f705"}, {"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20210008828, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Pong, Christopher M."}}, "id": "3da62d165fc94543828b86bb9997e9af"}, {"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20210008828, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Smith, Matthew W."}}, "id": "5dd1b71a89534cb4aded5a09bbe73c27"}, {"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20210008828, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Di Pasquale, Peter"}}, "id": "16970bb0dac747fa889c1999157a0e97"}, {"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20210008828, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Donner, Amanda J.N."}}, "id": "60b7ea2abd344c1fb261df0b1b1eea28"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Preprint (Draft being sent to journal)", "technicalReviewType": "NOT_SET", "modified": "2022-09-30T05:24:52.6242750+00:00", "id": 20210008828, "sourceIdentifiers": [{"number": "2014/48654", "type": "HANDLE"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20210008828, "publisher": "Pasadena, CA: Jet Propulsion Laboratory, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, 2018", "id": "b4c165cddd4b425d8bcad9799cf3a7c5", "publicationDate": "2018-10-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
