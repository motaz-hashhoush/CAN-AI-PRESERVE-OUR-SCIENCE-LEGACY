These technologies span the civil aviation fleet from general aviation to large subsonic and supersonic aircraft and promise to bring a new era of new aircraft, lower operation costs, faster more direct flight capabilities, more environmentally friendly aircraft, and safer airline operations. These initiatives have specific quantified goals that require technologies well beyond those currently being developed creating a bold new vision for aeronautics. Revolutionary propulsion systems are enabling for these advancements. This paper gives an overview of the new national aeronautics goals and explores for a selected subset of goals some of the revolutionary technologies will be required to meet some of these goals. The focus of the paper is on the pivotal role propulsion and icing technologies will play in changing the landscape of civil aviation.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 19970035085, "endDate": "1997-09-12T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "Air Breathing Engines", "location": "Chattanooga, TN", "id": "84a4ec1f6c7d49e49446a11d591ac49e", "startDate": "1997-09-07T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 19970035085, "id": "23c995eb17d240d79e34f2ff1834f732", "publicationDate": "1997-09-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19970035085.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19970035085/downloads/19970035085.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19970035085/downloads/19970035085.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19970035085/downloads/19970035085.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
