One of our primary objectives is to establish the relative chronology of major climatic events responsible for glaciation in the Andes and other regions that are difficult to access on the ground and where suitable material for absolute age determination is lacking. The sensitivity of radar to surface roughness makes it possible to develop a remotely-based relative dating technique for landforms for which surface age and roughness can be correlated. We are developing such a technique with Airborne Synthetic Aperture Radar (AIRSAR) imagery of the eastern Sierra Nevada where independent evidence is available for the ages and physical characteristics of moraines. The Sierra Nevada moraines are similar in form and environmental setting to Andean moraines that we have targeted for study during the pending Shuttle Imaging Radar-C (SIR-C) mission. SAR imagery is used to differentiate the ages of five moraine sequences of Walker Valley in the eastern Sierra Nevada. Other aspects of this investigation are briefly discussed.", "title": "Airborne SAR determination of relative ages of Walker Valley moraines, eastern Sierra Nevada", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T17:33:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19920018784, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Fox, A."}, "organization": {"name": "Cornell Univ.", "location": "Ithaca, NY, United States"}}, "id": "a2cad7bea0e64654a341881ed8b748b7"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19920018784, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Isacks, B."}, "organization": {"name": "Cornell Univ.", "location": "Ithaca, NY, United States"}}, "id": "5a84dcf09b634838b0ee7466ddfe74ef"}, {"sequence": 2, "submissionId": 19920018784, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Bloom, A."}, "organization": {"name": "Cornell Univ.", "location": "Ithaca, NY, United States"}}, "id": "a9e89b79669b4a51947741c4fd4233f9"}, {"sequence": 3, "submissionId": 19920018784, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Fielding, E."}, "organization": {"name": "Cornell Univ.", "location": "Ithaca, NY, United States"}}, "id": "5dcc9d95409b4bcb9ae9b21653581ea7"}, {"sequence": 4, "submissionId": 19920018784, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Mcmurry, D."}, "organization": {"name": "Cornell Univ.", "location": "Ithaca, NY, United States"}}, "id": "43f32ce4a1374962be6905bc3749b585"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-27T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19920018784, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19920018784, "id": "8eddcfeb624b4564bc3dcc5ade141a62", "publicationName": "JPL, Proceedings of the Third Airborne Synthetic Aperture Radar (AIRSAR) Workshop", "publicationDate": "1991-08-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 19920018770, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "Proceedings of the Third Airborne Synthetic Aperture Radar (AIRSAR) Workshop", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PROCEEDINGS", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
