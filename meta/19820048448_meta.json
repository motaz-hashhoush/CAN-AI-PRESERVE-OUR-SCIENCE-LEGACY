The multibody aircraft has two fuselage bodies located at approximately 28% wing semispan. The single-body aircraft is configured in such a way as to provide a reference base with which the multibody aircraft can be compared. The aircraft are sized to provide the lowest direct operating cost configuration when transporting 771,620 lbs. over a distance of 3,500 nautical miles at a cruise speed of Mach 0.80. The aircraft are assumed to operate in the years 1990-1995, thus allowing for the incorporation of those technologies expected to be mature and available for production usage in 1985. In comparison with the single-body aircraft, the two-body aircraft shows reductions of 8.9% in wing weight, 7.7% in structural weight, 13.5% in block fuel weight, and 11.3% in direct operating cost.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"submissionId": 19820048448, "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics"}}, "meetingId": "179d5ba088744834be2d56f12fa295c6", "id": "618c8da734d142bdac9a15197396c17c"}], "name": "nternational Very Large Vehicles Conference, 2nd, Washington", "location": "DC, May 17", "id": "179d5ba088744834be2d56f12fa295c6"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 19820048448, "id": "3626d6d1134745b8b30e4eaa8d20c1fe", "publicationDate": "1982-05-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
