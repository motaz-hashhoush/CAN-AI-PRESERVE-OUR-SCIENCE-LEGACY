Standard and optional services, which will be available to users of the Space Transportation System (STS) when it becomes operational in the 1980's, are described. Pricing policies established by NASA to encourage use of the STS by commercial, foreign and other U.S. Government users are explained. The small Self-Contained Payload Program, which will make space flight opportunities available to private citizens and individual experimenters who wish to use the Space Shuttle for investigative research, is discussed.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"submissionId": 19790033064, "endDate": "1978-03-10T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "Space Shuttle and Spacelab utilization: Near-term and long-term benefits for mankind; Proceedings of the Twenty-fourth Annual Meeting and Sixteenth Goddard Memorial Symposium", "location": "Washington, DC", "id": "28aee67038504739b86e15cb28b10f53", "startDate": "1978-03-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 19790033064, "id": "71c97899b2e14fb4a2b13e4fdca1f052", "publicationDate": "1978-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
