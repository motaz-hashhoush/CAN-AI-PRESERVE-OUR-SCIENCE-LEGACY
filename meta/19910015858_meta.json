Limited spacecraft power and thermal control capacity of these small spacecraft emphasized the need for high efficiency. Power topologies similar to those in the higher 2 kW and 5 to 30 kW power range were implemented, including a four transistor bridge switching circuit, current mode pulse-width modulated control, and an output current averaging inductor with an integral pulse generation winding. Reduction of switching transients was accomplished using a low inductance power distribution network, and no passive snubber circuits were necessary for power switch protection. Phase shift control of the power bridge was accomplished using an improved pulse width modulation to phase shift converter circuit. These features, along with conservative magnetics designs allowed power conversion efficiencies of greater than 92.5 percent to be achieved into resistive loads over the entire operating range of the converter. Electromagnetic compatibility requirements were not considered in this work, and control power for the converter was derived from AC mains. Addition of input filters and control power converters would result in an efficiency of on the order of 90 percent for a flight unit. Due to the developmental nature of arcjet systems at this power level, the exact nature of the thruster/power processor interface was not quantified. Output regulation and current ripple requirements of 1 and 20 percent respectively, as well as starting techniques, were derived from the characteristics of the 2 kW system but an open circuit voltage in excess of 175 V was specified. Arcjet integration tests were performed, resulting in successful starts and stable arcjet operation at power levels as low as 240 W with simulated hydrazine propellants.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 19910015858, "endDate": "1991-06-27T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Society for Electrical Engineers"}}, "meetingId": "979c738a0b0243f38b9dc161e319a322", "id": "68988a930b3a4d018f83a4d4cb1b7572"}, {"meta": {"organization": {"name": "ASME"}}, "meetingId": "979c738a0b0243f38b9dc161e319a322", "id": "419d4f0153144b0c9441bfdc9453090d"}, {"meta": {"organization": {"name": "IAA"}}, "meetingId": "979c738a0b0243f38b9dc161e319a322", "id": "9cb870fdf5a049a19cf80121ee4c865a"}, {"meta": {"organization": {"name": "SAE"}}, "meetingId": "979c738a0b0243f38b9dc161e319a322", "id": "5b26f6c97786405b97be8c7ced69f5e3"}], "name": "Joint Propulsion Conference", "location": "Sacramento, CA", "id": "979c738a0b0243f38b9dc161e319a322", "startDate": "1991-06-24T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 19910015858, "id": "ec6487b4d7f6443eba90b70779b536f8", "publicationDate": "1991-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19910015858.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19910015858/downloads/19910015858.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19910015858/downloads/19910015858.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19910015858/downloads/19910015858.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
