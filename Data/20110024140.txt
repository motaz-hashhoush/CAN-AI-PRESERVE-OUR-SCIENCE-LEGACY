This instrument is expected to be especially well-suited to measurement of ambient or near-ambient\ntemperature and, even more specifically,\nfor measuring the surface temperature of\na natural body of water. Although this radiometer would utilize the long-wavelength infrared (LWIR) portion of the\nspectrum (wavelengths of 8 to 12 \xc2\xb5m), its\nbasic principle of operation could also be\napplied to other spectral bands (corresponding to other temperature ranges) in\nwhich the atmosphere is transparent and\nin which design requirements for sensitivity and temperature-measurement accuracy could be satisfied.\nThe underlying principle of nulling\nand self-calibration is the same as that of a\ntypical microwave radiometer, but because of differences between the characteristics of signals in the infrared and microwave spectral regions, the principle\nmust be implemented in a different way.\nThe instrument (see figure) would\ninclude an infrared photodetector\nequipped with focusing input optics [e.g.,\nlens(es) and/or mirrors] and an input\nLWIR band-pass filter. An optomechanical device would periodically chop the\ninput to the photodetector between a reference gray body (ideally, a blackbody)\nand a test body (the temperature of which\none seeks to measure). The reference\nbody would be mounted on or in a heater,\na thermoelectric cooler, or other temperature-control device suited to the particular application. If needed, a band-pass\nLWIR filter could be placed in front of the\nphotodetector.\nThe AC component of the photodetector output would be fed to a lock-in amplifier. The reference or synchronization\nsignal for the lock-in amplifier would be\nderived from a device that monitored the\nmotion of the chopper. The output of the\nlock-in amplifier would be a rectified signal approximately proportional to the difference between the radiances of the test\nbody and the reference body. This signal\nwould be used as an error signal in a feed-\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 2003\n\nChopper\nReference Gray- or Blackbody\n\nTemperature Sensor\nTest Body\n\nThermoelectric\nCooler\n\nPhotodetector\nand Optics\nPhotodetector\nOutput\n\nPower Amplifier\n\nSynchronizing Signal\nFrom Chopper\nLock-In Amplifier\n\nController\n\nRADIOMETER\n\nLeaf\nSprings\nReflective Prism\nFrom\nReference\nBody\nLens\n\nFrom Test\nBody\n\nFrom\nReference\nBody\n\nFrom Test\nBody\n\nPhotodetector\n\nENLARGED, SIMPLIFIED VIEW OF CHOPPER AND PHOTODETECTOR\nAT THREE POINTS IN THE CHOPPING CYCLE\nThis Infrared Radiometer would exploit a nulling, self-calibrating principle that, heretofore, has been\nthe basis of design and operation of many microwave radiometers. The leaf-spring resonator design\nof the chopper would be an important element of the overall design of the instrument.\n\nback control loop, which would adjust the\npower supplied to the temperature-control device and thereby adjust the temperature of the reference body in an effort to\nreduce the error to zero. The temperature\nof the reference body would be measured\nby any of a variety of commercially available contact temperature sensors, which\ncan routinely afford accuracy and longterm stability within 0.1 K. Hence, as long\nas the error voltage remained at zero and\nassuming that the emissivities and other\nradiant properties of the test and reference bodies were sufficiently similar, it\ncould be assumed that the measured reference-body temperature was a close ap-\n\nproximation of the test-body temperature.\nInitial development efforts have been\nconcentrated on the chopper, which is a\nmajor innovative feature of the instrument design. The desired characteristics\nof the chopper include pure chopping,\nlow power consumption (a few milliwatts), high reliability (millions of cycles),\nand a chopping frequency of several\nhertz. \xe2\x80\x9cPure chopping\xe2\x80\x9d signifies that at\nany given instant of time, the infrared radiation incident on the photodetector\nwould be that from the test body and/or\nthe reference body and not from the\nchopper itself and that, moreover, during\none designated portion of the chopping\n\n5\n\ncycle, the photodetector would \xe2\x80\x9csee\xe2\x80\x9d only\nthe test body while during another designated portion of the cycle it would \xe2\x80\x9csee\xe2\x80\x9d\nonly the reference body.\nThe chopper design under consideration at the time of reporting the information for this article calls for an electromechanical resonator comprising two\npermanent magnets and a reflective\n\nprism mounted on leaf springs. Each permanent magnet would interact with one\nof two electromagnet coils. One electromagnet coil would be driven by amplifier\nto excite vibrations. The other electromagnet coil would serve as a pickup coil,\nproviding feedback to the amplifier to set\nup oscillations at the mechanical resonance frequency.\n\nThis work was done by Robert Ryan of Lockheed Martin Corp. for Stennis Space Center.\nThis invention is owned by NASA, and a\npatent application has been filed.

This system is needed because of the large and\nvarying nature of the overall ARC power\ndemand, which has been observed to\nrange from 20 to 200 MW. Large portions\nof peak demand can be attributed to only\nthree wind tunnels (60, 180, and 100 MW,\nrespectively). The APMS helps ARC avoid\nor minimize costly demand charges by enabling wind-tunnel operators, test engineers, and the power manager to monitor\ntotal demand for center in real time.\nThese persons receive the information\nthey need to manage and schedule energy-intensive research in advance and to\nadjust loads in real time to ensure that the\noverall maximum allowable demand is\nnot exceeded.\n\nThe APMS (see figure) includes a\nserver computer running the Windows\nNT operating system and can, in principle, include an unlimited number of\npower meters and client computers. As\nconfigured at the time of reporting the\ninformation for this article, the APMS\nincludes more than 40 power meters\nmonitoring all the major research facilities, plus 15 Windows-based client personal computers that display real-time\nand historical data to users via graphical\nuser interfaces (GUIs). The power meters and client computers communicate\nwith the server using Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/\nIP) on Ethernet networks, variously,\nthrough dedicated fiber-optic cables or\nthrough the pre-existing ARC local-area\nnetwork (ARCLAN).\nThe APMS has enabled ARC to\nachieve significant savings ($1.2 million in 2001) in the cost of power and\n\nelectric energy by helping personnel to\nmaintain total demand below monthly\nallowable levels, to manage the overall\npower factor to avoid low power factor\npenalties, and to use historical system\ndata to identify opportunities for additional energy savings. The APMS also\nprovides power engineers and electricians with the information they need to\nplan modifications in advance and\nperform day-to-day maintenance of\nthe ARC electric-power distribution\nsystem.\nThis work was done by Leonid Osetinsky of\nJacobs/Sverdrup Technology and David\nWong of Ames Research Center.

A hot film is\nmaintained at an elevated temperature\nrelative to the local flow by passing an\nelectrical current through it. The power\nrequired to maintain the specified temperature depends on the rate at which\nheat is transferred to the flow. The heat-\n\ntransfer rate correlates to the velocity gradient at the surface, and hence, with skin\nfriction. The hot-film skin friction measurement method is most thoroughly developed for steady-state conditions, but\nadditional issues arise under transient\nconditions.\nFabricating hot-film substrates using\nlow-thermal-conductivity ceramics can\noffer advantages over traditional quartz or\n\npolyester-film substrates. First, a low conductivity substrate increases the fraction\nof heat convected away by the fluid, thus\nincreasing sensitivity to changes in flow\nconditions. Furthermore, the two-part,\ncomposite nature of the substrate allows\nthe installation of thermocouple junctions just below the hot film, which can\nprovide an estimate of the conduction\nheat loss.\n\nHot Film (Thickness\nExaggerated for Visibility)\nVelocity\nProfile\n\nRCG\n\n15.9 mm\nHRSI\n\nWall\nSleeve of\nMachinable\nCeramic\nThermocouple\nLeads\n\n12.7 mm\nCROSS SECTION OF SENSOR INSTALLED IN WALL\n\nPHOTOGRAPH OF SENSOR AND LEADS\n\nFigure 1.

Steady-State Temperature Contours, determined from conjugate heat-transfer analyses, illustrate the effect of the lower thermal conductivity of\nthe composite ceramic substrate relative to a quartz substrate. Temperatures are indicated in \xc2\xb0C.\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 2003\n\n7\n\nFigure 1 depicts a hot-film sensor of\nthis type. The substrate is primarily composed of high-temperature reusable shuttle insulation (HRSI), a lightweight (density = 352 kg/m3), porous, ceramic\nmaterial originally developed to protect\nthe space shuttle from aerodynamic heating. A hard, non-porous coat of reactioncured glass (RCG) extends over the face\nof the cylinder and about one-third of the\nway down the side providing a surface on\nwhich the metallic hot film and its leads\ncan be deposited. Small-diameter [0.005\nin. (0.127 mm)] thermocouple wires are\nrouted through the HRSI. Small grooves\nin the end of the HRSI cylinder, form the\nlands of the thermocouples and are deep\nenough such that the wires lie flush with\nthe HRSI surface prior to being coated\nwith the RCG. The three thermocouple\njunctions are placed in a line. The substrates are placed in a machinable-ce-\n\nramic sleeve that provides electrical isolation for the hot-film leads. Type R thermocouples must be used because the\nhigh firing temperature of the RCG coating precludes the use of the more-sensitive thermocouples of type K\xe2\x80\x99s.\nThe hot film itself is approximately\n0.004 in. (\xe2\x89\x880.102 mm) wide and 1/4 in.\n(6.35 mm) long. Fabrication of the hot\nfilm and its leads begins with hand painting the desired pattern using organometallic inks. The painted substrate is\nthen heated in an oven, which removes\nthe solvents from the ink leaving only a\ngold-alloy film (see Figure 1 photo). The\nsensor thermocouples provide feedback\ncontrol to the oven. These techniques\ncould be used for the fabrication of\nother temperature and heat-flux gauges\non high-temperature ceramics.\nConjugate heat-transfer analyses were\nperformed on different substrate mate-\n\nrials in air at moderate velocity gradients\n(7,500 s\xe2\x80\x931). For the composite ceramic\nsubstrate, the ratio of heat leaving the\nsensor via convection to total heat produced is about 4 times higher than for a\nquartz substrate. Figure 2 depicts steadystate temperature contours for quartz\nand a composite ceramic substrate.\nPreliminary bench tests comparing hot\nfilms on composite ceramic and machinable-ceramic substrates indicate that, at\noverheat ratios of 1.2 and in horizontal\norientations, the higher conductivity\nmachinable-ceramic substrates require\nover 2.5 times the power.\nThis work was done by Greg Noffz of Dryden Flight Research Center, Daniel Leiser\nof Ames Research Center, Jim Bartlett of Langley Research Center, and Adrienne Lavine of\nUCLA.

DRC-01-48\n\nProbe Without Moving Parts Measures Flow Angle\nFlow angle is computed from forces measured by use of strain gauges.\nDryden Flight Research Center, Edwards, California\nThe measurement of local flow angle is\ncritical in many fluid-dynamic applications, including the aerodynamic flight\ntesting of new aircraft and flight systems.\nFlight researchers at NASA Dryden Flight\nResearch Center have recently developed, flight-tested, and patented the\nforce-based flow-angle probe (FLAP), a\nnovel, force-based instrument for the\nmeasurement of local flow direction.\nContaining no moving parts, the FLAP\nmay provide greater simplicity, improved\naccuracy, and increased measurement access, relative to conventional movingvane-type flow-angle probes.\nForces in the FLAP can be measured\nby various techniques, including those\nthat involve conventional strain gauges\n(based on electrical resistance) and\nthose that involve more advanced strain\ngauges (based on optical fibers). A correlation is used to convert force-measurement data to the local flow angle.\nThe use of fiber optics will enable the\nconstruction of a miniature FLAP, leading to the possibility of flow measurement in very small or confined regions.\nThis may also enable the \xe2\x80\x9ctufting\xe2\x80\x9d of a\nsurface with miniature FLAPs, capable of\nquantitative flow-angle measurements,\nsimilar to attaching yarn tufts for qualitative measurements.\nThe prototype FLAP was a small,\naerodynamically shaped, low-aspect-\n\n8\n\nFigure 1. The Prototype FLAP was a fin instrumented with simple electrical-resistance strain gauges.\n\nratio fin about 2 in. (\xe2\x89\x885 cm) long, 1 in.\n(\xe2\x89\x882.5 cm) wide, and 0.125 in.

Four strain gauges were\nmounted on the FLAP; two on the\nupper surface and two on the lower surface. The gauges were connected to\n\nform a full Wheatstone bridge, configured as a bending bridge.\nIn preparation for a flight test, the\nprototype FLAP was mounted on the airdata boom of a flight-test fixture (FTF)\non the NASA Dryden F-15B flight research airplane. The FTF is an aerodynamic fixture for flight-research experiments that is carried underneath the\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 2003\n\nConventional Flow-Angle Vanes\n\nF-15B FTF\nAir-Data Boom\nFLAP\n\nAirflow\n\nFigure 2.

Measurement data were collected as the FLAP\nwas flown on the F-15B at subsonic and\nsupersonic speeds up to mach 1.7 and altitudes up to 45,000 ft (\xe2\x89\x8813.7 km). FLAP\ndata were also collected under highangle-of-attack and high-vertical-acceleration flight conditions. The flight data\nanalyzed to date have verified the feasibility of the FLAP concept.\nIn a second-generation FLAP now\nunder development, the electricalresistance-strain-gauge force-measurement system of the prototype FLAP is replaced with a fiber-optic-strain-gauge\nforce-measurement system. This FLAP\nwill also be flown on the NASA Dryden\nF-15B airplane.\nThis work was done by Stephen Corda and\nM. Jake Vachon of Dryden Flight Research\nCenter.

Refer to DRC-01-09.\n\nDetecting Conductive Liquid Leaking From Nonconductive Pipe\nA capacitive detector is scanned over the ground above the pipe.\nJohn F. Kennedy Space Center, Florida\nA method that can be implemented\nwith relatively simple electronic circuitry provides a capability for detecting leakage of an electrically conductive liquid from an electrically\nnonconductive underground pipe. Alternatively or in addition, the method\ncan be applied to locate the pipe,\nwhether or not there is a leak. Although\nthe method is subject to limitations\n(some of which are described below), it\nis still attractive as an additional option\nfor detecting leaks and locating pipes\nwithout need for extensive digging.\nThe method is based on capacitive\ncoupling of an alternating electrical\nsignal from the liquid to a portable\nelectronic unit that resembles a metal\ndetector. A signal voltage is applied to\nthe liquid at some convenient point\nalong the pipe: for example, the signal\ncould be coupled into the liquid via an\naboveground metal pipe fitting, the interior surface of which is in contact\nwith the liquid. The signal is conducted\nthrough the liquid in the pipe; in the\ncase of diffusive leak of liquid into the\nsurrounding ground, the signal is conducted through the leak, into the portion of the adjacent ground that has\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 2003\n\nbecome soaked with the liquid. (A drip\nleak cannot be detected by this method\nbecause there is no conductive path between the liquid inside and the liquid\noutside the pipe.)\nThe portable unit includes an electrically conductive plate connected to the\ninput terminal of an amplifier. When\nthe plate is brought near the pipe or\nthe leaked liquid, a small portion of the\nsignal power is coupled capacitively\nfrom the liquid to the plate. The user\nscans the plate near the ground surface\nto find the locus of maximum signal\nstrength. The leak can be identified as a\nrelatively wide area, contiguous with\nthe location of the pipe, over which the\nsignal is detectable.\nIn order for this method to work, the\nliquid must be sufficiently conductive,\nand must be significantly more conductive than the ground is. Thus, for\nexample, the method does not work\nfor pure water, which is nonconductive,\nand does not work where the ground\nhas been soaked by a source other than\na leak (e.g., heavy rain). It should be\npossible to apply this method to, for example, common polyvinyl chloride\n(PVC) pipes that contain impure water\n\n(e.g., swimming-pool water) leaking\ninto fairly dry ground.\nThe resistance of a typical column of\nwater in a PVC pipe is of the order of\nmegohms. The combination of this\norder of magnitude of resistance with\nthe order of magnitude of capacitance\nin a typical practical case dictates the\nuse of a signal frequency or frequencies no higher than the low kilohertz\nrange. Using the audibility of signals in\nthe frequency range to make a virtue\nout of necessity, one could feed the detector-amplifier output to a set of earphones so that the user could keep visual attention focused on scanning the\nplate of the portable unit while listening for the signal.\nThis work was done by Rober t C.\nYoungquist of Kennedy Space Center.\nFurther information is contained in a TSP (see\npage 1).\nInquiries concerning rights for the commercial use of this invention should be addressed to the Technology Programs and\nCommercialization Office, Kennedy Space\nCenter, (321) 867-8130.

Perhaps even more importantly, arrays of\nmicroscopic batteries can be fabricated\nand tested in combinatorial experiments\n\n12\n\ndirected toward optimization and discovery of battery materials.\nThe value of the combinatorial approach to optimization and discovery has\nbeen proven in the optoelectronic, pharmaceutical, and bioengineering industries. Depending on the specific application, the combinatorial approach can\ninvolve the investigation of hundreds or\n\neven thousands of different combinations; hence, it is time-consuming and\nexpensive to attempt to implement the\ncombinatorial approach by building and\ntesting full-size, discrete cells and batteries. The conception of microbattery arrays makes it practical to bring the advantages of the combinatorial approach\nto the development of batteries.\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 2003\n\nMicrobattery arrays (see figure) are\nfabricated on substrates by use of conventional integrated-circuit manufacturing techniques, including sputtering, photolithography, and plasma\netching. The microbatteries incorporate the same cathode materials of\ninterest for conventional lithium-ion\nbatteries such as LiCoO 2 and LiCo x Ni 1\xe2\x80\x93x O 2 . If multiple deposition\nsources are used in the fabrication of a\ngiven array, then the chemical compositions of battery components of interest can be varied across the substrate,\nmaking it possible to examine what\namounts to almost a continuum of\ncompositions. For example, assuming\n\nThis is a Scanning Electron Micrograph of a microbattery array. The lightly shaded contact\npads are cathode current collectors. The darker\ncontact pads are anode current collectors. The\ncathodes and solid electrolyte of each cell are\nsandwiched between the anode and cathode\ncontact pads and are not visible in this view.\n\nthat a 4-in. (10-cm) substrate is used,\nthe test-device pitch is 50 \xc2\xb5m, and the\nconcentration gradient is 80 percent\nacross the substrate, then the compositions of adjacent test cells can be expected to differ by only about 0.04 percent. Because thousands of test cells\ncan be fabricated in a single batch, it\nbecomes practical to test thousands of\ncombinations of battery materials by\nuse of microbattery arrays, as contrasted with only about 10 to 20 combinations by use of macroscopic cells.\nThe following is an example of a procedure for fabricating an array of\n[LiCoxNi1\xe2\x80\x93xO2 cathode/lithium phosphorus oxynitride solid electrolyte/nickel\nanode] cells like those shown in the figure, with a gradient in the cathode\ncomposition.\n1. A Ti film is deposited on a 4-in.\n(\xe2\x89\x8810-cm) oxidized Si substrate. A Mo\nfilm is subsequently deposited on\nthe Ti film.\n2. The Mo-Ti bilayer is patterned by use of\nphotolithography and wet etching to\ndefine the cathode current collectors.\n3. The substrate is patterned with thick\nnegative photoresist, with vias in the\nphotoresist opened over selected\nareas of the current collectors.\n4. A film of LiCoxNi1\xe2\x80\x93xO2 cathode material is deposited on the substrate with\nthe desired gradient in x and selectively removed by use of a lift-off\nprocess, such that LiCoxNi1\xe2\x80\x93xO2 is\npresent only on the cathode current\ncollectors.\n\n5. A film of the solid electrolyte lithium\nphosphorous oxynitride is deposited.\n6. A film of Ni is deposited.\n7. The Ni film is patterned to define the\nanode current collectors.\n8. The Ni film is selectively removed by\nion milling.\n9. A protective coat (for example, vapordeposited Parylene) is applied.\nAll depositions described above are\nperformed by magnetron sputtering. The\nprocedure can be readily modified to\nyield gradients in the cathode with\nother cations of interest: for example,\nLiCoxNi1\xe2\x80\x93xO2 could be replaced with\nLiCoxNiyMn1\xe2\x80\x93x\xe2\x80\x93yO2 with the desired gradients in x and y.\nThe cells can be tested by use of a commercial semiconductor-parameter analyzer connected to the test cells via tungsten probe needles. By applying a current\nof the order of 5 nA to a cell from the cathode to the anode, the cell can be charged\nby oxidizing the cathode and reducing the\nLi at the anode. The charged cell can be\ndischarged by reversing the polarity of the\ncurrent. The cells can be tested in the\nsame manner as that used to test conventional lithium-ion cells to obtain information on such characteristics as cycle life\nand charge/discharge capacities, all as a\nfunction of compositions of the cathode.\nThis work was done by William West, Jay\nWhitacre, and Ratnakumar Bugga of Caltech for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

The method was devised primarily\nfor use in tracking of distant target spacecraft by large terrestrial beam-waveguide\nantennas of NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Deep Space Network\n(DSN). The method should also be adaptable to tracking, by other beam-waveguide\nantennas, of targets that move with large\ntransverse velocities at large distances\nfrom the antennas.\nThe aberration effect arises whenever a spacecraft is not moving along\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 2003\n\nthe line of sight as seen from an antenna on Earth. In such a case, the\nspacecraft has a cross-velocity component, which is normal to the line-ofsight direction. In order to obtain optimum two-way communication, the\nuplink and downlink beams must be\npointed differently for simultaneous\nuplink and downlink communications. At any instant of time, the downlink (or receive, Rx) beam must be\npointed at a position where the spacecraft was 1/2-round-trip light time\n(RTLT) ago, and the uplink (or transmit, Tx) beam must be pointed where\nthe spacecraft will be in 1/2 RTLT\n(see figure). In the case of a high-\n\ngain, narrow-beam antenna such as is\nused in the DSN, aiming the antenna\nin other than the correct transmitting\nor receiving direction, or aiming at a\ncompromise direction between the\ncorrect transmitting and receiving directions, can give rise to several dB of\npointing loss.\nIn the present method, the antenna is\naimed directly at the apparent position\nof the target, so that no directional correction is necessary for reception of the\nsignal from the target. Hence, the effort\nat correction is concentrated entirely on\nthe transmitted beam. In physical terms,\nthe correction is implemented by moving the transmitting feed along a small\n\n13\n\nApparent Position of Target\n\nPredicted Position of Target\nt=0\n\nt = \xe2\x80\x93T2\n\nt = +T2\n\n(\xce\xb1,\xce\xb2)\nAntenna Axis for\nReception and\nTransmission\n\nT \xe2\x89\xa1 Round Trip Time\nTransmitted\nBeam\n\nReceived\nBeam\n\nY\n\nY\n(x,y)\nX\n\nReceiving Receiving\nFeed\nFeed\nat (0,0)\nat (x,y)\nTransmitting Feed on X-Y Table\nReceiving Feed\n\nElevation Angle\n\nBEAM-WAVEGUIDE ANTENNA WITH ABERRATION\n\nTransmitting\nPosition\n\nReceiving\nPosition\n\xce\xb1\n\n\xce\xb2\n\xcf\x81\n\xcf\x95\n\nAzimuth Angle\n\nANGULAR-SEPARATION\nCOORDINATES\n\nCOORDINATES FOR DISPLACEMENTS\nOF TRANSMITTING FEED\n\nThe Transmitting Feed Is Displaced in X and Y by amounts needed to point the transmitting beam away\nfrom the receiving beam (which coincides with the antenna axis) by angular-separation amounts \xce\xb1 and \xce\xb2.\n\ndisplacement vector chosen so that the\ndirection of the transmitted beam is altered by the small amount needed to\nmake the beam point to the anticipated\nposition of the target at the anticipated\n\ntime of arrival of the transmitted signal at\nthe target.\nThe angular and linear coordinates\nmentioned in the following sentences are\ndefined in the figure.

This investigation\nhas contributed to a revival of the concept\nof the rainbow photovoltaic array, which\noriginated in the 1950s but proved unrealistic at that time because the selection of\nsolar photovoltaic cells was too limited.\nAdvances in the art of photovoltaic cells\n\n14\n\nsince that time have rendered the concept more realistic, thereby prompting\nthe present development effort.\nA rainbow photovoltaic array comprises side-by-side strings of series-connected photovoltaic cells. The cells in\neach string have the same bandgap,\nwhich differs from the bandgaps of the\nother strings. Hence, each string operates most efficiently in a unique wavelength band determined by its bandgap.\nTo obtain maximum energy-conversion\n\nefficiency and to minimize the size and\nweight of the array for a given sunlightinput aperture, the sunlight incident on\nthe aperture is concentrated, then spectrally dispersed onto the photovoltaicarray plane, whereon each string of cells\nis positioned to intercept the light in its\nwavelength band of most efficient operation. The number of cells in each\nstring is chosen so that the output potentials of all the strings are the same;\nthis makes it possible to connect the\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 2003\n\nSeries Connections\n\nSunlight\nFresnel-Like\nPrism Array\n\nUV\n\nGaP\nAlGaAs\n\nA\n\nInGaP2\n\nIncident\nSpectrum\n\nGaAs\nInGaAs, Bandgap 0.74 eV\nInGaAs, Bandgap 0.62 eV\n\nA\nPanel of\nPhotovoltaic\nCells\n\nIR\n\nVIEW A-A MAGNIFIED, SHOWING STRINGS OF\nPHOTOVOLTAIC CELLS\n\nA Curved Fresnel Prism would concentrate and spectrally disperse sunlight onto adjacent strings of solar photovoltaic cells, each string optimized for the\npart of the spectrum incident upon it.\n\nstrings together in parallel to maximize\nthe output current of the array.\nAccording to the original rainbow photovoltaic concept, the concentrated sunlight was to be split into multiple beams by\nuse of an array of dichroic filters designed\nso that each beam would contain light in\none of the desired wavelength bands. The\nconcept has since been modified to provide for dispersion of the spectrum by use\nof adjacent prisms. A proposal for an advanced version calls for a unitary concentrator/spectral-beam-splitter optic in the\nform of a parabolic curved Fresnel-like\n\nprism array with panels of photovoltaic\ncells on two sides (see figure). The surface supporting the solar cells can be adjusted in length or angle to accommodate the incident spectral pattern.\nAn unoptimized prototype assembly\ncontaining ten adjacent prisms and\nthree photovoltaic cells with different\nbandgaps (InGaP2, GaAs, and InGaAs)\nwas constructed to demonstrate feasibility. The actual array will consist of a lightweight thin-film silicon layer of prisms\ncurved into a parabolic shape. In an initial test under illumination of 1 sun at\n\nzero airmass, the energy-conversion efficiency of the assembly was found to be\n20 percent. Further analysis of the data\nfrom this test led to a projected energyconversion efficiency as high as 41 percent for an array of 6 cells or strings\n(GaP, AlGaAs, InGaP2, GaAs, and two\ndifferent InGaAs cells or strings).\nThis work was done by Nick Mardesich\nand Virgil Shields of Caltech for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet\nPropulsion Laboratory.

The purpose served\nby the metal side reflectors is to increase\nquantum efficiency by helping to trap\nlight in the photosensitive material of\neach pixel.\nThe reasons for using diffraction gratings were discussed in several prior NASA\nTech Briefs articles. To recapitulate: In an\narray of QWIPs, the quantum-well layers\nare typically oriented parallel to the focal\nplane and therefore perpendicular or\nnearly perpendicular to the direction of incidence of infrared light. By virtue of the\napplicable quantum selection rules, light\npolarized parallel to the focal plane (as\nnormally incident light is) cannot excite\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 2003\n\nQWIP Photosensitive Volume\n\nOne Pixel\n\nDiffraction Grating\n\nThin GaAs Substrate\nIncident Infrared Light\n\nFigure 1. Light Is Diffracted almost parallel to the focal plane for maximum quantum efficiency in a QWIP of\ntypical prior design. However, in the absence of reflectors like those shown in Figure 2, much of the diffracted\nlight is lost from the QWIP of a given pixel after a single pass through the photosensitive QWIP volume.\n\ncharge carriers and, hence, cannot be detected. Diffraction gratings scatter normally or nearly normally incident light into\ndirections more nearly parallel to the focal\nplane, so that a significant portion of the\nlight attains a component of polarization\nnormal to the focal plane and, hence, can\n\nexcite charge carriers. Unfortunately, light\nscattered in directions parallel or nearly\nparallel to the focal plane can escape sideways from the QWIP of a given pixel, as\nillustrated in Figure 1. The escaped light\nhas made only a single pass through the interior photosensitive volume of the QWIP.\n\n15\n\nThe quantum efficiency of the\nQWIP would be increased by trapping\nlight so that it makes multiple passes\nthrough the photosensitive volume.

The FHSRS affords a combination of capabilities, including those\nformerly provided by three separate pro-\n\ngrams in purchasing, inventorying, and\ninspecting hardware. The FHSRS provides a Web-based interface with a server\ncomputer that supports a relational\ndatabase of inventory; electronic routing\nof requests and approvals; and electronic documentation from initial request through implementation of quality criteria, acquisition, receipt,\ninspection, storage, and final issue of\nflight materials and components. The\ndatabase lists both hardware acquired\nfor current projects and residual hardware from previous projects. The increased visibility of residual flight components provided by the FHSRS has\ndramatically improved the re-utilization\nof materials in lieu of new procurements, resulting in a cost savings of over\n$1.7 million. The FHSRS includes subprograms for manipulating the data in\nthe database, informing of the status of a\nrequest or an item of hardware, and\nsearching the database on any physical\nor other technical characteristic of a\ncomponent or material. The software\nstructure forces normalization of the\ndata to facilitate inquiries and searches\nfor which users have entered mixed or\ninconsistent values.\nThis program was designed and written by\nJohn Salisbury, Scott Savage, and Shirman\nThomas of Cortez III for Marshall Space\nFlight Center.

Glenn Research Center, Cleveland, Ohio\nThermal-barrier coatings (TBCs)\nthat have both initial and post-exposure\nthermal conductivities lower than those\nof yttria-stabilized zirconia TBCs have\nbeen developed. TBCs are thin ceramic\nlayers, generally applied by plasma\nspraying or physical vapor deposition,\nthat are used to insulate air-cooled\nmetallic components from hot gases in\ngas turbine and other heat engines.\nHeretofore, yttria-stabilized zirconia\n(nominally comprising 95.4 atomic percent ZrO2 + 4.6 atomic percent Y2O3)\nhas been the TBC material of choice.\nThe lower-thermal-conductivity TBCs\nare modified versions of yttria-stabilized\nzirconia, the modifications consisting\nprimarily in the addition of other oxides that impart microstructural and\ndefect properties that favor lower thermal conductivity.\nTBCs are characterized by porosity,\ntypically between 5 and 20 percent.\nPorosity reduces the thermal conductivity of a TBC below the intrinsic conductivity of a fully dense (that is, nonporous) layer of the TBC material. The\nthermal conductivity of a TBC increases\nas its porosity is reduced by the sintering\nthat occurs during use at high temperature. For future engines that will operate\nat higher gas temperatures, TBCs with\ngreater degrees of both initial insulating\n\ncapability and retention of insulating capability will be needed.\nThe present lower-thermal-conductivity TBCs are made of ZrO2 and Y2O3\ndoped with additional oxides that are\nchosen to perform three functions:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Create thermodynamically stable,\nhighly defective lattice structures with\ntailored ranges of defect-cluster sizes\nto exploit the effectiveness of such\nstructures as means of attenuating and\nscattering phonons, thus reducing\nthermal conductivity;\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Produce of highly distorted lattice\nstructures with essentially immobile defect clusters and/or nanoscale ordered\nphases, which effectively reduces concentrations of mobile defects and\nmovements of atoms, thus increasing\nsintering-creep resistance; and\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Exploit the formation of complex\nnanoscale clusters of defects to increase the measures of such desired\nmechanical properties such as fracture\ntoughness.\nThe additional oxides in a TBC according to this concept are typically selected as\na pair \xe2\x80\x94 one from each of two groups of\noxides denoted for this purpose as groups\nA and B. Group A includes scandia\n(Sc2O3) and ytterbia (Yb2O3). These oxides are highly stable, and the radii of\ntheir trivalent cations are smaller than\n\nthose of the primary dopant yttria. Group\nB includes neodymia (Nd2O3), samaria\n(Sm2O3), and gadolinia (Gd2O3) which\nare also highly stable, and their trivalent\ncations are larger than those of yttria.\nLike yttria, the A and B oxides are regarded as stabilizers. Preferably, the total\nstabilizer content (yttria + A oxide + B\noxide) should lie between 4 and 50\natomic percent. The concentration of yttria should exceed that of each of other\nstabilizers, and the concentrations of the\nA and B oxides should be approximately\nequal. Formulations other than the foregoing preferred one are also possible:\nVariations include the use of alternative\ngroup-A oxides (e.g., MgO2, NiO,\nCr2O3), the use of two or more group-A\nand/or group-B oxides, substitution of\nhafnia for zirconia, and substitution of\nother primary stabilizers (e.g., dysprosia\nor erbia) for yttria.\nThis work was done by Robert A.

The process is especially useful for\nsmoothing those silicon areas that have\nbeen exposed by etching a pattern of\nholes in a layer of silicon dioxide that covers the substrate. Applications in which\none could utilize smooth silicon surfaces\nlike those produced by this process include fabrication of optical waveguides,\nepitaxial deposition of silicon on selected\nareas of silicon substrates, and prepara-\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 2003\n\ntion of silicon substrates for deposition of\nadherent metal layers.\nDuring etching away of a layer of SiO2\nthat covers an Si substrate, a polymer becomes deposited on the substrate, and\nthe substrate surface becomes rough\n(roughness height \xe2\x89\x88 50 nm) as a result of\nover-etching or of deposition of the polymer. While it is possible to smooth a silicon substrate by wet chemical etching,\nthe undesired consequences of wet\nchemical etching can include compro-\n\nmising the integrity of the SiO2 sidewalls\nand undercutting of the adjacent areas\nof the silicon dioxide that are meant to\nbe left intact.\nThe present RIE process results in\nanisotropic etching that removes the\npolymer and reduces height of roughness of the silicon substrate to <10 nm\nwhile leaving the SiO2 sidewalls intact\nand vertical. Control over substrate versus sidewall etching (in particular, preferential etching of the substrate) is\n\n19\n\nachieved through selection of process\nparameters, including gas flow, power,\nand pressure. Such control is not uniformly and repeatably achievable in wet\nchemical etching. The recipe for the\npresent RIE process is the following:\nEtch 1 \xe2\x80\x94 A mixture of CF4 and O2\ngases flowing at rates of 25 to 75 and 75\nto 125 standard cubic centimeters per\nminute (stdcm3/min), respectively;\npower between 44 and 55 W; and pressure between 45 and 55 mtorr (between\n\n6.0 and 7.3 Pa).

Kennedy Space Center, Florida\nA relatively simple chemical treatment\nthat involves the use of emulsified iron\nhas been found to be effective in remediating groundwater contaminated with\ntrichloroethylene and other dense\nchlorohydrocarbon liquids. These liquids\nare members of the class of dense, nonaqueous phase liquids (DNAPLs), which\nare commonly recognized to be particularly troublesome as environmental contaminants. The treatment converts these\nliquids into less-harmful products.\nAs a means of remediation of contaminated groundwater, this treatment takes\nless time and costs less than do traditional\npump-and-treat processes. At some sites,\nlong-term leakage and/or dissolution of\nchlorohydrocarbon liquids from pools\nand/or sorbed concentrations in rock and\nsoil gives rise to a need to continue pumpand-treat processes for times as long as\ndecades in order to maintain protection of\nhuman health and the environment. In\ncontrast, the effects of the emulsified-iron\n\n20\n\ntreatment are more lasting, decreasing the\nneed for long-term treatment and monitoring of contaminated areas.\nThe material used in this treatment consists of iron particles with sizes of the order\nof nanometers to micrometers contained\nwithin the micelles of a surfactant-stabilized, biodegradable, oil-in-water emulsion. The emulsion is simple to prepare\nand consists of relatively inexpensive and\nenvironmentally acceptable ingredients:\nOne typical formulation consists of 1.3\nweight percent of a food-grade surfactant,\n17.5 weight percent of iron particles, 23.2\nweight percent of vegetable oil, and 58.0\nweight percent of water.\nThe emulsion is injected into the\nground via a push well. Free-phase\nchlorohydrocarbon molecules diffuse\nthrough the oil membranes of the emulsion particles to the surfaces of the iron\nparticles, where dehalogenation takes\nplace. The dehalogenation reactions generate hydrocarbon byproducts (primarily\n\nethylene in the case of trichloroethylene), which diffuse out of the emulsion\nmicelles and are benign in nature.\nExperiments have demonstrated several aspects of the effectiveness of this\ntreatment by use of emulsified iron:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 This treatment is more effective in degrading free-phase trichloroethylene\nthan is a similar treatment that uses\nonly pure iron particles.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Emulsions containing iron can be injected into soil matrices, where they\nbecome immobilized and remain immobile, even in the presence of flowing water.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Iron emulsions can exert an effect\nequivalent to pulling globules of\ntrichloroethylene into their micelles.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 No chlorinated byproducts from the\ndegradation of trichloroethylene pass\nout of the micelles. The only degradation products that have been observed to leave the iron emulsions are\nethylene as mentioned previously,\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 2003\n\nplus trace amounts of other innocuous hydrocarbons.\nLaboratory studies have shown that the\namount of emulsion needed to degrade a\ngiven amount of trichloroethylene is approximately eight times the mass of the\ntrichloroethylene. Because there are no\ncontinuing operating costs after the emulsion has been injected through push\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 2003\n\nwells, the iron-emulsion treatment offers a\nsubstantial economic advantage over the\nlong-term pump-and-treat method.\nThis work was done by Jacqueline Quinn\nof Kennedy Space Center and Christian\nA.

This finding has\npractical significance for a variety of applications in which it is desirable to increase dispersion of drops. For example,\n\nin chemical-process sprays, increased\ndispersion leads to increases in chemical-reaction rates; in diesel engines, increasing the dispersion of drops of\nsprayed fuel reduces the production of\nsoot; and in household and paint sprays,\nincreasing the dispersion of drops\nmakes it possible to cover larger surfaces.\nIt has been known for some years that\nsingle-phase fluid jets that enter flow\n\n1.0\nSINGLE PHASE\n\n0.5\nCircle\n\nx3/DJ\n\nSquare\n0\n\nEllipse\nRectangle\nTriangle\n\n\xe2\x80\x930.5\n\n\xe2\x80\x931.0\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\nx1/DJ\n\n1.0\nTWO PHASE\n\n0.5\nCircle\n\nx3/DJ\n\nSquare\n0\n\nEllipse\nRectangle\nTriangle\n\n\xe2\x80\x930.5\n\n\xe2\x80\x931.0\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\nx1/DJ\n\nThe Potential Core of a jet is defined as the region beyond which the velocity is no longer equal to\nthat at the inlet. These plots are outlines of computationally simulated potential cores of single- and\ntwo-phase jets issuing from inlets with the noted cross sections. DJ denotes the equivalent jet diameter, which, for a noncircular inlet, is defined as the diameter of a circular inlet of equal cross-sectional\narea. The symbols x1 and x3 denote Cartesian coordinates parallel and perpendicular, respectively, to\nthe initial jet axis.\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 2003\n\nfields through noncircular inlets entrain\nmore fluid than do comparable jets entering through circular inlets. The computational study reported here was directed in part toward determining\nwhether and how this superior mixing\ncharacteristic of noncircular singlephase jets translates to a similar benefit\nin cases of two-phase jets (that is, sprays).\nThe study involved direct numerical\nsimulations of single- and two-phase free\njets with circular, elliptical, rectangular,\nsquare, and triangular inlet cross sections. The two-phase jets consisted of gas\nladen with liquid drops randomly injected at the inlets. To address the more\ninteresting case of evaporating drops,\nthe carrier gas in the jets was specified to\nbe initially unvitiated by the vapor of the\nliquid chemical species and the initial\ntemperature of the drops was chosen to\nbe smaller than that of the gas. The\nmathematical model used in the study\nwas constructed from the conservation\nequations for the two-phase flow and included complete couplings of mass, momentum, and energy based on thermodynamically self-consistent specification\nof the enthalpy, internal energy, and latent heat of vaporization of the vapor.\nThe results of the numerical simulations yielded information on (1) the different spreading behaviors occurring for\ndifferent inlet cross sections and (2) the\ndifferences between flow fields in the\npresence and absence of liquid drops.\nThe most important consequence of interaction of drops with the flows was\nfound to be the production of enhanced\nstreamwise vorticity that alters entrainment and the mixing of species according to the inlet geometry. At the time station corresponding to steady-state\nentrainment, the potential cores of twophase jets were found to be shorter than\ntheir single-phase counterparts by an\norder of magnitude (see figure).\nWhereas the two-phase circular jets were\nfound to exhibit symmetric entrainment\npatterns at a location well past the\nstreamwise locations of the potential\ncores, the noncircular jets were found,\nat the same location, to depart strongly\nfrom symmetry. The phenomenon of\n\n23\n\nupstream-vs.-downstream exchange of\nmajor and minor axes of elliptical cross\nsections (\xe2\x80\x9caxis switching\xe2\x80\x9d for short) of\nsingle-phase jets was not observed in the\ntwo-phase jets.\nConsiderations of the distributions of\nthe number density of drops, liquid\nmass, and evaporated species distribu-\n\n24\n\ntions lead to recommending elliptical\ncross sections as optimal ones in that\nthey result in optimal combinations of\ndispersion and mixing. All of the computations were performed for pre-transitional jets (that is, jets on the laminar\nside of the transition between laminar\nand turbulent flow). Further investiga-\n\ntions would be necessary to elucidate the\neffects of turbulence.\nThis work was done by Josette Bellan and\nHesham Abdel-Hameed of Caltech for\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

The United States has network of gas-distribution pipes with a\ntotal length of approximately 109 m.\nThese pipes are often made of iron and\nsteel and some are more than 100 years\nold. As this network ages, there is a need\nto locate weaknesses that necessitate repair and/or preventive maintenance.\nThe most common weaknesses are leaks\nand reductions in thickness, which are\ncaused mostly by chemical reactions between the iron in the pipes and various\nsubstances in soil and groundwater.\nAt present, mobile robots called pigs\nare used to inspect and clean the interiors of gas-transmission pipelines. Some\ncarry magnetic-flux-leakage (MFL) sensors for measuring average wall thicknesses, some capture images, and some\nmeasure sizes and physical conditions.\nThe operating ranges of pigs are limited\nto fairly straight sections of wide transmission-type (as distinguished from distribution-type) pipes: pigs are too large\nto negotiate such obstacles as bends with\nradii comparable to or smaller than pipe\ndiameters, intrusions of other pipes at\nbranch connections, and reductions in\ndiameter at valves and meters. The\nGPEXs would be smaller and would be\nable to negotiate sharp bends and other\nobstacles that typically occur in gas-distribution pipes.\nUnlike a pig, a GPEX would be able to\noperate or even fail inside a pipe without\nstopping the gas flow. It would be capable\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 2003\n\nof operating for long times and traveling\nlong distances without human intervention, so that expensive and disruptive\nurban excavation could be kept to a minimum; to make this possible, the GPEX\nwould generate its own power from the\nflow of gas. It would communicate information, including low-rate data like those\nfrom an MFL sensor and high-rate image\ndata that show corrosion, leaks, and buckles. Two-way radio communication, for\nboth retrieval of inspection data and control of the GPEX, would take place at gigahertz carrier frequencies, with pipes serving as waveguides. The GPEX must\ntransform its shape as needed to cope\nwith changes in pipe dimensions, dents,\npipe bends, and pipe intrusions.\nA prototype GPEX that would be capable of operating inside either a 4-in.\n(10-cm) or a 6-in. (15-cm) pipe has been\ndeveloped. At present, it is viewed as infeasible to package all the needed functions of the GPEX inside a single body\nthat could negotiate right-angle turns in a\n10-cm pipe. Therefore, the prototype\nGPEX is composed of a train of multiple\nunits, much like a railroad train. Because\nthe source of power would be the flow of\nnatural gas in the pipe to be inspected,\nthe first unit in the train would be a combination of a power generator and locomotive. The flow of gas [typically methane\nat a flow speed of 10 m/s, a pressure of\n60 psi (\xe2\x89\x880.4 MPa), and a temperature of\n15 \xc2\xb0C] could supply sufficient power to\nenable the robot to perform all its tasks,\nwithout a major loss of gas pressure.\nThe initial development effort is expected to focus on the power-genera-\n\ntor/locomotive unit. The power generator would be a permanent-magnet\nmotor back-driven by a miniature turbine driven by the flow of gas. In normal\noperation, power of at least 2 W would\nbe required, and the pressure drop\nwould have to be limited to no more\nthan 0.3 psi (2 kPa). A further requirement is that in the event of worst-case\nfailure of the generator or any other\npart of the GPEX, the pressure drop not\nexceed 0.6 psi (4 kPa).\nThe power-generator/locomotive unit\nis a pair of bodies connected by an extension actuator. Multiple bladders can\nbe alternately inflated and deflated to\nexert forces on the pipe wall, and the extension actuator can increase or decrease the separation between the bodies\nto move the unit in \xe2\x80\x9cinchworm\xe2\x80\x9d fashion.\nThis work was done by Brian Wilcox of\nCaltech for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

Overspray is an unavoidable parasitic component of spray\nthat occurs because the flow of air or other\n\ngas in the spray must turn at the sprayed\nsurface. Very small droplets are carried\naway in this turning flow, and some land on\nadjacent surfaces not meant to be painted.\nSuction Exhaust Tube and Support\n(One of Four)\n\nPlenum\nNozzle\n\nArea To Be Spray-Painted\n\nTOP VIEW\nTo Suction Pump With Filter\n\nTo Suction Pump With Filter\nSprayer\n\nSupporting Arms\nSuction Exhaust\nTube and Support\nSpray\n\nNozzle\n\nPlenum\n\nThroat\n\nLip\n\nSurface To Be Spray-Painted\n\nSIDE VIEW\n\nThe Paint-Overspray Catcher would suck the turning flow of gas and entrained paint droplets, preventing the droplets from landing on non-target surfaces. The planform of the catcher plenum and\nnozzle need not be round as shown here: It could have any other convenient shape, depending on\nthe boundary of the area to be painted.\n\nThe basic principle of the paint-spray\ncatcher is to divert the overspray into a\nsuction system at the boundary of the\narea to be painted. The paint-spray\ncatcher (see figure) would include a\ntoroidal plenum connected through narrow throat to a nozzle that would face toward the center of the torus, which\nwould be positioned over the center of\nthe area to be spray-painted. The\nplenum would be supported by four\ntubes that would also serve as suction exhaust ducts. The downstream ends of the\ntubes (not shown in the figure) would be\nconnected to a filter on a suction pump.\nThe pump would be rated to provide a\nsuction mass flow somewhat greater than\nthat of the directed spray gas stream, so\nthat the nozzle would take in a small excess of surrounding gas and catch nearly\nall of the overspray. A small raised lip at\nthe bottom edge of the nozzle would\ncatch paint that landed inside the nozzle.\nEven if the paint is directly piston\npumped, the droplets entrain an air flow\nby time they approach the wall, so there\nis always a gas stream to carry the excess\ndroplets to the side. For long-duration\nspraying operations, it could be desirable\nto include a suction-drain apparatus to\nprevent overflowing and dripping of\npaint from inside the lip. A version without an external contraction and with the\nthroat angled downward would be a\nmore compact version of catcher, although it might be slightly less efficient.\nThis work was done by Leonard M. Weinstein of Langley Research Center.

In comparison with the\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 2003\n\nprior method, the present method involves less processing time. Also,\nwhereas the prior method yields irregularly shaped and sized specimens, the\npresent developmental method offers\n\nthe potential to prepare specimens of\nregular shape and size.\nThe prior method is called the\nmethod of sharp shards because it involves crushing the material of interest\n\n27\n\nand selecting microscopic sharp shards\nof the material for use as specimens.\nEach selected shard is oriented with its\nsharp tip facing away from the tip of a\nstainless-steel pin and is glued to the tip\nof the pin by use of silver epoxy. Then\nthe shard is milled by use of a focused\nion beam (FIB) to make the shard very\nthin (relative to its length) and to make\nits tip sharp enough for atom-probe\nanalysis. The method of sharp shards is\nextremely time-consuming because the\nselection of shards must be performed\nwith the help of a microscope, the\nshards must be positioned on the pins\nby use of micromanipulators, and the irregularity of size and shape necessitates\nmany hours of FIB milling to sharpen\neach shard.\nIn the present method, a flat slab of\nthe material of interest (e.g., a polished\nsample of rock or a coated semiconductor wafer) is mounted in the sample\nholder of a dicing saw of the type conventionally used to cut individual inte-\n\ngrated circuits out of the wafers on\nwhich they are fabricated in batches. A\nsaw blade appropriate to the material of\ninterest is selected. The depth of cut\nand the distance between successive\nparallel cuts is made such that what is\nleft after the cuts is a series of thin, parallel ridges on a solid base. Then the\nworkpiece is rotated 90\xc2\xb0 and the pattern of cuts is repeated, leaving behind\na square array of square posts on the\nsolid base.\nThe posts can be made regular, long,\nand thin, as required for samples for\natom-probe analysis. Because of their\nsmall volume and regularity, the amount\nof FIB-milling time can be much less\nthan that of the method of sharp shards.\nIndividual posts can be broken off for\nmounting in a manner similar to that of\nthe method of sharp shards. Alternatively, the posts can be left intact on the\nbase and the base can be cut to a small\nsquare (e.g., 3 by 3 mm) suitable for\nmounting in an atom probe of a type ca-\n\npable of accepting multiple-tip specimens. The advantage of multiple-tip\nspecimens is the possibility of analyzing\nmany tips without the time-consuming\ninterchange of specimens.\nThis work was done by Kim Kuhlman and\nJames Wishard of Caltech for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet\nPropulsion Laboratory.

Examples of such shapes or\nparts include tapered helices, paraboloids with axes of different lengths,\nand even Archimedean screws that\ncould serve as rotors in microturbines.\nThe proposed inverse tomo-lithographic process would be based partly\non a prior microfabrication process\nknown by the German acronym \xe2\x80\x9cLIGA\xe2\x80\x9d\n(\xe2\x80\x9clithographie, galvanoformung, abformung,\xe2\x80\x9d which means \xe2\x80\x9clithography, electroforming, molding\xe2\x80\x9d). In LIGA, one\ngenerates a precise, high-aspect ratio\npattern by exposing a thick, x-ray-sensitive resist material to an x-ray beam\nthrough a mask that contains the pattern. One can electrodeposit metal into\nthe developed resist pattern to form a\nprecise metal part, then dissolve the resist to free the metal. Aspect ratios of\n\n28\n\n100:1 and patterns into resist thicknesses\nof several millimeters are possible.\nTypically, high-molecular-weight poly\n(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) is used as\nthe resist material. PMMA is an excellent\n\nresist material in most respects, its major\nshortcoming being insensitivity. Conventional x-ray sources are not practical for\nLIGA work, and it is necessary to use a\nsynchrotron as the source.

Upon development of the PMMA (used here as an x-ray photoresist material), a helix would remain.\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 2003\n\nchrotron radiation is highly collimated\nand its wavelength of synchrotron radiation is typically <5 \xc3\x85, there is very little\ndiffraction and the pattern of a high-contrast mask is projected deep into a resist\nwith nearly perfect vertical sidewalls. Of\ncourse, the only three-dimensional shape\nthat can be formed in this way is the\nlocus of points generated by moving the\nmask pattern along the direction of incidence of the radiation.\nIn a recently developed variant of\nLIGA, a rotating PMMA rod is exposed to\nx-rays through a stationary mask; this technique can be used to make axisymmetric\nstructures; e.g., objects shaped like wine\nglasses or baseball bats. The proposed\ntechnique would also involve stenciling an\nx-ray image into a rotating PMMA rod,\nbut would differ from prior techniques in\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 2003\n\nthat the mask would be moved in synchronism with the rod to generate a\nthree-dimensional pattern. The synchronized motions of the mask and rod would\nbe generated by translation and rotation\nstages actuated by stepping motors under\ncontrol by a computer.\nDescribing the x-ray exposure technique in different words, a changing\ntwo-dimensional pattern would be projected into a three-dimensional one. In\ntomography, one decodes a three-dimensional pattern from the changing\ntwo-dimensional pattern obtained by illuminating it from a changing direction.\nIn the proposed technique, one would\nessentially reverse this decoding process;\nthat is, one would encode or construct a\nthree-dimensional pattern by illuminating the region of interest in a changing\n\ntwo-dimensional pattern: That is why the\nproposed x-ray exposure technique is\ncalled \xe2\x80\x9cinverse tomography.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe figure depicts an example of the\nuse of this technique to generate a simple helix. The two-dimensional projection (shadow) of a helix is a sinusoid. To\nform the helical pattern in a PMMA rod,\none would project x-rays perpendicularly toward the rod through a mask with\na sinusoidal pattern while rotating the\nrod and translating the mask along the\nrod at a speed of one wavelength of the\nsinusoid per rotation period.\nThis work was done by Victor White and\nDean Wiberg of Caltech for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet\nPropulsion Laboratory.

A\nprobe according to the proposal would include a capillary tube coated with metal\non its inside to make it reflective. A microlens would be hermetically sealed onto\none end of the tube. A spectroscopic\nprobe head would contain a single such\nprobe, which would both deliver laser\nlight to a sample and collect Raman or fluorescent light emitted by the sample.\n\n32\n\nThe capabilities of most prior Raman\nand fluorescence fiber-optic probes are\nlimited because of spurious emission of\nRaman and fluorescent light by the cores\nof the optical fibers themselves. To prevent the spurious emissions from overwhelming the desired Raman and/or fluorescence signals, it is necessary to\nincorporate spectral filters. In a given application, such a filter undesirably limits\nthe probe to a single laser wavelength. Filtration is usually performed by means of\nfree-space optics in the probe head.\n\nThese optics are vulnerable to misalignment. Alternatively, thin-film filters can\nbe deposited directly on optical fibers or\nin proximity to the fibers, but the performances of such filters are inferior to\nthose of free-space optical filters.\nA typical probe according to the proposal would have an outside diameter of\n<1 mm. Relative to a typical prior Raman\nprobe, this probe would be much\nsmaller and lighter and could be manufactured at lower cost. The interior of\nthe probe could be evacuated or filled\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 2003\n\nwith a gas (e.g., argon) that does not\nemit any Raman or fluorescent light in\nthe spectral region of interest. Hence,\nthere would be no need for filters, ancillary filter optics, and associated mounting hardware vulnerable to misalignment, and so the probe would be better\nable to withstand such adverse environmental conditions as higher pressures,\ntemperatures, and mechanical shocks.\nThe elimination of filters would make it\npossible to operate the probe at more\nthan one wavelength. A probe according\nto the proposal could perform well in\nthe deep ultraviolet spectral region,\nwhich is important for spectral detection\nof organisms. Unlike fiber-optic probes\ncontaining filters, these probes could be\nused to measure Raman wave-number\nshifts smaller than 50 cm\xe2\x80\x931.\nIn the development of these probes, it\nshould be possible to take advantage of\nthe knowledge base already accumulated in the use of metallized capillary\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 2003\n\ntubes to deliver laser beams for surgery\nand cutting metal. Provided that the reflectivity of the interior metal coat of a\ncapillary is sufficiently high, the numerical aperture of the capillary sufficiently\nlow, and the diameter of the capillary\nsufficiently large, it should be possible to\nachieve efficient transmission of light\nalong the capillary.\nThe small size, low cost, and multiwavelength capability of these probes\nmake them attractive for many Raman\nand fluorescence applications. Matrices\nof samples generated by combinatorial\nchemistry could be analyzed by an array\nof these probes interfaced to a single\nfiber-optic probe head or directly to a\nsingle Raman spectrograph. Access ports\nto chemical reactors could be kept\nsmall, reducing the potential hazards of\na seal failure. Probes inserted into large\nchemical reactors could be much\nsmaller in diameter due to the greatly relaxed stiffness requirements compared\n\nto traditional Raman probes. Also, because of their smallness, they would be\ncapable of withstanding high pressures\nand would be well suited for use in undersea exploration.\nThis work was done by Michael Pelletier of\nCaltech for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

The configuration of\nthe MASS and RAMS is designed to run\nthe models at very high spatial resolution and incorporate local data to resolve fine-scale weather features. Model\npreprocessors were modified to incorporate surface, ship, buoy, and rawinsonde\ndata as well as data from local wind towers, wind profilers, and conventional or\nDoppler radars.\nThe overall evaluation of the MASS,\nEta, and RAMS was designed to assess the\nutility of these mesoscale models for satisfying the weather-forecasting needs of\nthe U.S. space program. The evaluation\nmethodology includes objective and subjective verification methodologies. Objective (e.g., statistical) verification of\npoint forecasts is a stringent measure of\nmodel performance, but when used\nalone, it is not usually sufficient for quantifying the value of the overall contribu-\n\ntion of the model to the weather-forecasting process. This is especially true for\nmesoscale models with enhanced spatial\nand temporal resolution that may be capable of predicting meteorologically\nconsistent, though not necessarily accurate, fine-scale weather phenomena.\nTherefore, subjective (phenomenological) evaluation, focusing on selected case\nstudies and specific weather features,\nsuch as sea breezes and precipitation, has\nbeen performed to help quantify the\nadded value that cannot be inferred\nsolely from objective evaluation.\nThis work was done by John T.

Aerodynamic design can thus be formulated as an optimization problem that involves the minimization of an objective function subject\nto constraints.\nA new aerodynamic design optimization procedure based on neural networks\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 2003\n\nand response surface methodology (RSM)\nincorporates the advantages of both traditional RSM and neural networks. The procedure uses a strategy, denoted parameterbased partitioning of the design space, to\nconstruct a sequence of response surfaces\nbased on both neural networks and polynomial fits to traverse the design space in\nsearch of the optimal solution.\nSome desirable characteristics of the\nnew design optimization procedure include the ability to handle a variety of design objectives, easily impose constraints,\nand incorporate design guidelines and\n\nrules of thumb. It provides an infrastructure for variable fidelity analysis and reduces the cost of computation by using\nless-expensive, lower fidelity simulations\nin the early stages of the design evolution.

Although the method is applicable, in\nprinciple, to any gyroscopes, it is intended especially for application to gy-\n\n36\n\nroscopes that are parts of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). The\nmethod is based on the concept that\nthe collective performance of multiple,\nrelatively inexpensive, nominally identical devices can be better than that of\none of the devices considered by itself.\nThe method would make it possible to\nsynthesize the readings of a single,\n\nmore accurate gyroscope (a \xe2\x80\x9cvirtual gyroscope\xe2\x80\x9d) from the outputs of a large\nnumber of microscopic gyroscopes fabricated together on a single MEMS\nchip.

In the combining-and-filtering operations, measurement data from the\ngyroscopes would be weighted and\nsmoothed with respect to each other according to the gain matrix of a minimum-variance filter. According to\nKalman-filter theory, the gain matrix of\nthe minimum-variance filter is uniquely\nspecified by the filter covariance, which\npropagates according to a matrix Riccati equation. The present method incorporates an exact analytical solution\nof this equation.\nThe analytical solution reveals a wealth\nof theoretical properties and enables the\nconsideration of several practical implementations. Among the most notable theoretical properties are the following:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Even though the terms of the Riccati\nequation grow in an unbounded\nfashion, the Kalman gain can be\nshown to approach a steady-state\nmatrix. This result is fortuitous because it simplifies implementation\nand can serve as a basis of practical\nschemes for realizing the optimal filter by use of a constant- gain matrix.\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, June 2003\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The analytical solution enables the\ndevelopment of a complete statistical theory that characterizes the\ndrift of the virtual gyroscope and\nprovides theoretical limits of improvement obtainable by use of an\nensemble of correlated sensors as a\nsingle virtual sensor.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The minimum-variance gain matrix\nhas been analyzed in detail. The\nstructure of the gain matrix indicates\nthe presence of a marginally unstable\npole, which would make implementation impossible if it were not properly\nunderstood and compensated. In addition, a simple algebraic method for\ncomputing the optimal gain matrix\nhas been developed, making it possible to avoid the Riccati equation completely.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The notion of statistical commonmode rejection (CMR) has been\ncharacterized mathematically. For statistically uncorrelated gyroscopes, it is\nshown that the component drift variances add like parallel resistors (e.g.,\nin units of rad2/sec3). For identical\ndevices, this means that the combined\ndrift is reduced by a factor of 1 N\ncompared to the individual gyroscope\ndrift, where N is the number of gyroscopes being combined.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Potential improvement in drift is\nmuch more impressive when the de-\n\nvices are correlated. For correlated\ngyroscopes, an exact mathematical\nexpression is developed for the combined drift. The expression indicates that the internal noise sources\ncount to the extent that they infect\nmultiple devices coherently (e.g.,\nwith common sign), and can be removed to the extent that they infect\nmultiple devices incoherently (e.g.,\nwith randomized signs). Noise eliminated by correlations between devices can potentially reduce the virtual gyroscope drift far beyond the\n1 N factor attainable using uncorrelated devices.\nThis work was done by David S.

Because many parts of a\nrobotic manipulator are cylindrical, the\nOBB method has been extended in this\nOctagonal Boundary of OBP\n\nBoundaries of Constituent OBBs\nFigure 1. A Rodlike Robot Arm of Circular Cross\nSection, viewed here along its axis, can be represented by an octagonal OBP assembled from\nfour smaller OBBs.\n\n38\n\nFigure 2. A Hierarchy of OBBs of successively finer resolution is used to represent terrain elevation as\na function of horizontal coordinates.\n\nmethod to enable the approximate representation of cylindrical parts by use of octagonal or other multiple-OBB assemblies\ndenoted oriented bounding prisms\n(OBPs), as in the example of Figure 1. Unlike prior methods, the OBB/OBP method\ndoes not require any divisions or transcendental functions; this feature leads to\ngreater robustness and numerical accuracy.\nThe OBB/OBP method was selected for incorporation into the present method because it offers the best compromise between accuracy on the one hand and\ncomputational efficiency (and thus computational speed) on the other hand.\nOBBs are also used to represent the terrain and any objects on the terrain sensed\nby the stereoscopic vision system. A conceptual multiresolution map pyramid of\nthe manipulator work space is computed\nfrom the stereoscopic sensory data and is\nthen used in a coarse-to-fine sequence to\ndetect collisions between the manipulator\nand terrain. As described next, tests for\ncollisions are performed in a hierarchical\nsequence to minimize the amount of computation needed to detect collisions.\nStarting with the second-highest level of\nthe pyramid, each level is characterized by\n\ntwice the horizontal spatial resolution of\nthe level above it (see Figure 2). For example, at the highest level of the pyramid\n(coarsest resolution) there is a single terrain OBB that encloses all of the sensed\ndata points. The model for each manipulator link is one low-resolution OBP. If no\ncollisions between any of the OBPs and\nthe coarsest-resolution terrain OBB are\ndetected, then there is no need for further computation to detect collisions with\nterrain. On the other hand, if collisions\nare detected at the coarsest resolution,\nthen tests for collisions are performed on\neach of the terrain OBBs at the second\ncoarsest resolution. This process continues to successively finer levels of resolution until the finest resolution is reached\nor no more collisions are detected. Similar tests for collisions are performed with\na similarly hierarchical model of the nonmanipulator parts of the robot (body,\ncameras, sensors, suspension, and\nwheels).\nThis work was done by Chris Leger of Caltech for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
