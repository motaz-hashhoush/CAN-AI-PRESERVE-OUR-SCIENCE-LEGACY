Hamley and Gerald M. Hill\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration\nLewis Research Center\nCleveland, Ohio 44135\nABSTRACT\nIn anticipation of the needs of future light-weight, low-power spacecraft, arcjet power\nelectronics in the 100-400W operating range were developed. Limited spacecraft power and thermal\ncontrol capacity of these small spacecraft emphasized the need for high efficiency. Power topologies\nsimilar to those in the higher 2k and 5 to 30 kW power range were implemented, including a four\ntransistor bridge switching circuit, current mode pulse-width modulated control, and an output current\naveraging inductor with an integral pulse generation winding. Reduction of switching transients was\naccomplished using a low inductance power distribution network, and no passive snubber circuits were\nnecessary for power switch protection. Phase shift control of the power bridge was accomplished using\nan improved pulse width modulation to phase shift converter circuit. These features, along with\nconservative magnetics designs allowed power conversion efficiencies of greater than 92.5% to be\nachieved into resistive loads over the entire operating range of the converter. Electromagnetic\ncompatibility requirements were not considered in this work, and control power for the converter was\nderived from AC mains. Addition of input filters and control power converters would result in an\nefficiency of on the order of 90% for a flight unit. Due to the developmental nature of arcjet systems\nat this power level, the exact nature of the thruster power processor interface was not quantified.\nOutput regulations and current ripple requirements of 1 and 20% respectively, as well as starting\ntechniques, were derived from the characteristics of the 2kW system but an open circuit voltage in\nexcess of 175 V was specified. Arejet integration tests were performed, resulting in successful starts\nand stable arcjet operation at power levels as low as 240 watts with simulated hydrazine propellant.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nThe 1950\'s and 1960\'s saw arcjets first\nconsidered as an advanced propulsion system. The\nprime interest of NASA during this time period\nwas planetary missions, and research centered\naround high powered, high specific impulse\narcjets using hydrogen propellant. 1-4 Some\nsuccessful operation at the 1-2 kW power level\nwas demonstrated with hydrogen propellant with\nthe intent of using these devices in an auxiliary\npropulsion role. Ammonia was also considered as\nan alternate propellant. 5,6 Storable propellants\nsuch as hydrazine were also tested, but these\nefforts met with little success. 7 A review of\nthese programs was compiled by Wallner and\nCsika in 1965, and research was limited for a\nperiod thereafter. 8\n- The past decade has seen the re-emergence of\nthe arcjet as an advanced propulsion system,\nespecially in the 1-2 kW power level, auxiliary\npropulsion role using hydrazine propellant.\nStable operation of these devices has been\ndemonstrated over a wide range of power levels\nand propellant flow rates with specific impulse\nvalues of 450-500 seconds. 9-14\n\nPulse width modulated (PWM) power\nsupplies with integral starting circuits have been\ndeveloped in the 1-30 kW power level range and\nhave demonstrated reliable start-up and steady\nstate operation with vortex flow stabilized\narcjets. 15-17\nA new class of spacecraft is being developed\nwith limited power, low voltage power buses\nwhich cannot support the 1-2kW class arcjet\nsystems, 18,19 but may benefit from the addition\nof advanced propulsion systems. These spacecraft\nare likely to have maximum power system\ncapacities on the order of 1kW. This limited\npower capacity places a premium on PPU\nefficiency to minimize power losses and heat load\non the spacecraft. Techniques such as the use of\nmagnetics with low core and conduction losses,\nalong with power stage designs which minimize\nparasitic impedances must be employed to\nminimize the losses. These parasitic impedances\nwould otherwise generate transients that must be\ndamped with passive dissipating components.\nAdditionally, spacecraft electromagnetic\ncompatibility requirements necessitate the use of\npassive input filters. This combined with the\npower used for control circuits represents a\n\nsignificant 2-5% fraction of the total system\npower at this low power level, further\nemphasizing the need to minimize losses.\nThe arcjet power processor interface at these\nlow power levels has not yet been quantified, but\nextrapolation of previous data20 indicated that\nPPU output voltages greater than 150V will be\nrequired. Output ripple requirements, derived from\nprevious work with higher power arcjets,15-17\nindicated that a larger current averaging inductor\nin the output of the power processor would be\nneeded because of the lower level of output\ncurrent.\nThis paper documents the design process of\nthe PPU, and presents the results of arcjet\nintegration tests.\n\namplitude starting pulse would be of value in\ncharacterizing the requirements for reliable starts.\nThe maximum pulse amplitude was specified on\nthe order of 4 kV with a duration of 30\xc2\xb5s. Steady\nstate ripple requirements were set on the order of\n20% as per previous work. 15-17\nPhysical Interfaces\nPackaging the PPU in a flight type\nenclosure was beyond the scope of this effort. In\nno way were attempts made to minimize the size\nor weight of the PPU, as the main design goal\nwas power efficiency.\nDESIGN\nThe overall schematic for the low power\narcjet PPU is presented in Figure 1. The various\ncomponents will be discussed in the following\nsections\n\nSYSTEM INTERFACES\nSpacecraft/PPU Interface\nPower distribution systems for lightweight,\nlow power spacecraft are likely to be of the low\nvoltage 28V nominal type, with a maximum\npower rating of 1kW. 18,19 Exact power levels\navailable depend on a large number of factors\nsuch as battery system capacity, orbit altitude,\nand array degradation over time. This resulted in\nthe selection of a power range of 100-400W for\nthe propulsion system. Due to the developmental\nnature of the satellites and the arcjet itself at this\npower level, large tolerance bands were placed on\nthe input and output characteristics of the PPU to\nallow flexibility in testing. Thus, the input\nvoltage for this design was 28V nominal, with a\ntolerance of +7 and -4V. Isolation of the load\nfrom the spacecraft bus was required to conform\nwith common single point grounding schemes.\nEMI filtering was not designed, as no interface\nspecification was available. The design goal for\npower conversion efficiency was 93%, which\ncorresponds to a heat load of 22.5W at a 300W\noutput level, but addition of EMI filter losses and\ncontrol power requirements on the order of 8W\nwill result in an overall efficiency of\napproximately 90%, resulting in a total heat load\nof 33W.\n\nTopology\nA full bridge was chosen as the power circuit\ntopology for the PPU. This was due to the\ndistinct advantages of this circuit compared to a\nconventional push pull design which were\noutlined by Gruber in the development of the\n5kW arcjet PPU. 16 One important advantage is\nthat the phase-shifted bridge provides a current\npath for the dissipation of energy stored in\nleakage and parasitic inductances. However, this\nenergy is still dissipated in the form of\nconduction losses in the switches, and care must\ntherefore, be taken to minimize the stored\nenergy.A schematic of the full bridge topology is\nillustrated in Figure 2. The reference side of the\nbridge with gate drives 01 and 02 are operated at\na 50% duty cycle. The phase shifted gate drives\n03 and 04 are also 50% duty cycle drives, but\ntheir phase is shifted with respect to the reference\nside to increase or decrease the current through\nthe primary of the power transformer by varying\nthe time the switches on the diagonals of the\nbridge are on.\nPower Stagg\nA diagram of the power stage is shown in\nFigure 3. The physical layout of the power stage\nwas designed to minimize the loop areas of the\npower conductors to minimize the parasitic\ninductances of the power stage. The DC input\nreturn was used as a baseplate/heat sink for the\npower stage and was fabricated from a 6.35 mm\naluminum plate. A 3.5 mm slot was then milled\ninto the plate to accept a 2.5 mm aluminum bar\nwhich served as the positive input voltage bus.\nThe slot was lined with 1 mm printed circuit\nboard material, which served as an insulator prior\nto the installation of the bus bar. The bus bar\nwas installed into the prepared slot using nylon\nscrews, such that the top surface of the installed\n\nThruster/PPU Interface\nDue to the developmental nature of the low\npower arcjet system, the exact characteristics of\nthe arcjet/PPU interface were not quantified at the\ntime of the initial design. It was assumed that the\neventual propellant choice would be a storable\npropellant, most likely hydrazine. Previous work\nhas demonstrated techniques for the reliable start\nand operation of hydrazine arcjets, 15,16,21 and\nthese techniques were carried through to this\nwork. However, it was decided that a variable\n\n2\n\nbus bar was flush with the surface of the\nbaseplate. In the case of this power stage,\nswitches Q1-4 were two power MOSFETs in\nparallel. Switches Q1 and Q3 of Figure 2 were\nthen directly mounted to the bus bar, making the\ncommon drain connection A of Figure 2. The\npins normally used for the drain connection were\nmoved, because the rear of the TO-247 transistor\npackage also served as the drain connection.\nConnections B and C tied the sources of Q1\nand Q3 to the drains of Q2 and Q4 respectively,\nand were the connection points for the power\ntransformer primary winding. Slots for the\ntransformer bus bars were milled in a fashion\nsimilar to that for the positive bus, with an\nimportant exception. The sources of Q2 and Q4\nhad to be connected to the DC return baseplate,\nthus, when the slots were milled "fingers" of\nbaseplate material were left protruding into the\nslot directly under the source pins for Q2 and Q4.\nThe source pins were then connected to the base\nplate. Connections B and C of figure 2 were\nmade on the bus bars used for the transformer\nconnection. The gate drive leads for each of the\ntransistors were brought in from the back of the\npower stage with through holes drilled under each\nof the gate pins. An area of the base plate was\nremoved to allow for the installation of the Hall\neffect sensors used to measure the primary\ncurrent. Bus power was brought into the power\nstage through a stripline and all filter capacitors\nwere connected to minimize lead lengths and loop\nareas. This resulted in a power stage with\nminimized parasitic inductance.\n\nControls\nAll control circuits and gate drive circuits in\nthis design are supplied power from the 1 IOVAC\nmains. Conversion of these circuits to 28VDC\npower input is straightforward, but would reduce\nthe overall efficiency on the order of 3%. The\nbasic control circuit for the PPU illustrated in\nFigure 4 was the PWM controller described by\nGruber for the I and 5 kW arcjet power\nelectronics and is described in detail\nelsewhere. 15,16 An improved phase shift\nconverter circuit was implemented and is\nillustrated in figure 5. Operational details of this\ncircuit appear in Appendix A.\nThe full bridge power stage configuration\nrequired isolated gate drive circuits for QI-Q4.\nNote that the drives for Q2 and Q4 could have the\nsame reference, but were isolated in this\napplication. Thus, the control circuits were\ncompletely isolated from the simulated spacecraft\nbus. To facilitate this, a gate isolation circuit23\nwas used which utilized optical coupling. This\neliminated the need for transformer isolation in\nthe gate drives and the problems observed with\ntransformer gate drive circuits, such as slow rise\ntimes. A schematic of this gate drive circuit\nappears in Figure 6.\n\nOutput Filter\nSteady state current ripple requirements on\nthe order of 20%, similar to those of previous\nunits, were carried through to this work, The\noutput filter for the PPU was, itself, similar in\nconcept to previous designs. 15,16 However, due\nto the low DC arc current and the need for\ncontinuous current flow, a larger inductance was\nrequired. In the case of the lkW unit, the output\ninductor is typically on the order of 1mH. For\nthis design a 27 mH inductor was used. A\nmolybdenum powder core with a relative\npermeability of 300 was chosen to minimize the\nnumber of turns required and the overall size of\nthe inductor. Details of the design are presented\nin Table 1. The number of turns required could be\nreduced by adding an additional core to the present\ndesign.\nThe output filter also had an integral start\nwinding to produce a high voltage pulse which\ninitiated the arc discharge. Details of this starting\ntechnique are presented elsewhere. 21 A front\npanel potentiometer was added which controlled\nthe duration of the charge cycle time of the pulse\nwinding. This resulted in an adjustable pulse\namplitude of 0 to 4.2kV, while maintaining the\nduration of the pulse near 30\xc2\xb5s.\n\nTransformer Design\nA Supermal-loy tape wound toroidal core\nwith a tape thickness of 0.025 mm was selected\nas the core material for the main power\ntransformer. The selection was made based on a\nhistory of use of metallic tape wound cores for\nflight projects, and its superior durability and\nheat transfer characteristics compared to\nferrites. 22 This material was capable of\nsustaining a flux density on the order of 0.6T,\nbut this flux density resulted in a core loss of\n4.5W/kg at a switching frequency of 8 kHz,\nwhich was undesirable. A flux density of 0.2T\nwas selected, which reduced the core losses an\norder of magnitude. This was judged a\nworthwhile option, since the additional tums\nrequired on the transformer added only 3% more\nmass, and the increased conduction losses were\napproximately 1W. Details of the transformer\ndesign are listed in Table 1. The switching\nfrequency of 8 kHz was selected to minimize the\nswitching and core losses.\n\n3\n\nPower Slane\nPerformance of the low inductance power\nstage was as expected. The primary voltage and\ncurrent waveforms are illustrated in Figure 10.\nOperating conditions were 28V input, and the\noutput voltage and current were 123V and 3A,\nrespectively. These values approximated a full\noutput power condition with an arcjet load. The\nvoltage waveform shows negligible overshoot\nand ringing at turn on. The current waveform\ndoes show some ringing at turn on, however, it\nmust be noted that no snubber circuits were in\nuse. These traces did indicate that snubbers were\nnot necessary for transistor protection, however,\nEMI considerations may require damping of the\noscillations in the primary current. The heat\nsinking capabilities of this power stage were\nadequate for room temperature, still air operation\nof the unit at maximum power. This was\noriginally a concern for the high side switches\nQ1 and Q3 of Figure 3 since only the positive\ninput bus bar was used as a heat sink for these\nswitches. The other switches, Q2 and Q4 were\nable to use the more massive baseplate as a heat\nsink.\n\nPHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS\nMinimizing the weight and volume of the\ncompleted PPU were beyond the scope of this\neffort. The overall weight of the completed PPU\nwas 7.0 kg, but this weight includes several\n110V 60Hz supplies used in the control circuits\nwith their associated magnetics which contributed\n2.6 kg to the total weight. Conversion of these\ncircuits to 28V input high frequency converters\nwould reduce their weight on the order of 75%.\nThe heaviest components of the PPU were the\nmagnetics, and these could be made smaller, as\nan oversized diameter core was used for the main\npower transformer. Reduction of the core\ndiameter would result in a physically smaller\ntransformer, without altering the designed flux\ndensity. The overall dimensions of the PPU\nwere 25.4 cm 30.4 cm x 19.1 cm. A photograph\nof the completed prototype PPU appears in\nFigure 7.\n\nPERFORMANCE\nOutput Characteristics\nThe operational envelope for the PPU is\npresented in Figure 8 fora nominal 28V,\nminimum 24V and maximum 35V input into a\nresistive load. The curve was obtained by setting\nthe current control to the maximum value and\nvarying the load resistance. The open circuit\nvoltage was 180V, and the current limit was 4A.\nAt this maximum current point, the power\nsupply is not regulating, and the 4A output\ncurrent was set by the current limit setpoint on\nthe primary side of the power transformer. Thus,\nthese limits represented absolute maximums for\nthe PPU, as the maximum designed current\nrating was 3.5A. The effect of changing the input\nvoltage was to increase or decrease the open\ncircuit voltage proportionally. The 4A current\nlimit effectively limits output surge current,\nwhich protects the thruster during the start\ntransient.\nLine regulation data are presented in Table 2.\nThese data indicate line regulation of better than\n1% over the operational input voltage range for\nthree different load conditions. Load regulation\nwas similarly found to be better than 1%.\nFigure 9 illustrates a typical family of start\npulses generated by the variable amplitude start\ncircuit. The maximum amplitude was in excess\nof 4 kV with 30\xc2\xb5s duration. A pulse of 2.8kV\namplitude was used successfully in interface tests\nindicating that this arrangement had ample energy\nto start the thruster\n\nEfficiency\nEfficiency measurements were made using\nthe following techniques. Input and output\ncurrents were measured using shunts that were\ncalibrated with National Bureau of Standards\n(NBS) traceable equipment. The input, output\nand current shunt voltages were measured with a\ncalibrated digital voltmeter (DVM). One meter\nwas used to measure all parameters to minimize\nvariations present in multi-instrument\nprocedures. An output current was established\ninto a resistive load, and several minutes were\nallowed to pass prior to taking any measurements\nto allow the load and shunt resistors to\nequilibrate thermally. The input voltage to the\nPPU was set at the minimum 24V, nominal\n28V, and maximum 35V value at each of three\ncurrent setpoints.\nResults of the efficiency tests are listed in\nTable 2. Typical efficiencies were in the range of\n92.5-92.8%, which corresponds to a spacecraft\nmaximum heat load of approximately 30W.\nTable 3 itemizes some of the power losses. The\nefficiency can be improved somewhat by adding\nan additional core to the output inductor, thus\nreducing the number of turns required. Larger\ndiameter conductors can also be employed to\nreduce conduction losses, especially in the power\ntransformer secondary and the output inductor.\nConduction losses could be further reduced by\nadding additional MOSFETs in parallel in the\n\n4\n\nresulted in a large negative dildt in the output\ninductor. This caused a second high voltage pulse\nto appear at the arcjet. In this case the amplitude\nof the second pulse was 1.6kV. In some cases, as\nin Figure 12c, a second breakdown occurred.\nAn arcjet start is illustrated in Figure 12d. In\nthis case, the converter was powered, thus,\ntransition to steady state operation was possible.\nNo thruster damage was noted in any of the\nthruster starts.\n\npower stage. It is estimated that the addition of\n28V control circuits and EMI filters for a flight\ntype unit will reduce the overall efficiency to\napproximately 90%.\nTHRUSTER INTERFACE TESTS\nArcjet interface tests were conducted with a\nprototype low power arejet. The thruster design\nwas based on the I kW arcjet described in detail\nelsewhere. 22 In the case of the prototype\nthruster, the cathode was reduced in diameter from\n3.2 mm to 1.6 mm, and the anode insert was\nalso modified and is illustrated in Figure 11. The\nconstrictor had a diameter of 0.31 mm and was\n0.05 mm in length. A 300 half angle was used in\nthe converging side of the nozzle and the\ndiverging half angle was 20 0 . A conical tip with\na half angle of 300 was used on the cathode, and\nthe electrode gap was set to 0.39 mm. This\ngeometry was tested with various flow rates to\ndetermine starting characteristics and stable steady\nstate operating limits. The propellant used was a\n1:2 stoichiometric mixture of nitrogen and\nhydrogen to simulate the products of decomposed\nhydrazine. Cold flow Isp for this geometry was\non the order of 118 sec.\n\nStead,yS\ntate Qperation\n\nThe low power PPU was tested at seven\nsteady state operating conditions with the\nprototype thruster. Two flow rates, 1.6x 10 -5 and\n2. l x 10 -5 kg/s were used. The thruster always\nstarted successfully at either flow rate, and\ntransition to the steady state condition was\nuneventful. Static impedance data were taken at\n2.5, 3.0, and 3.5A with stable operation\ndemonstrated at each point. These static\nimpedance data are plotted in Figure 13, and\nillustrate the standard negative impedance slope\ncharacteristics common to hydrazine arcjets.20\nSteady-state arc voltage and current\nwaveforms are presented in Figure 14. In this\ncase the peak current was 3.2A, and the\nminimum was 2.6A. This resulted in an average\narc current of 2.9A with a ripple of 0.6A peak-topeak amplitude, or 20.7%. The average arc\nvoltage in this case was 105V, with a peak-topeak ripple amplitude of IOV. Power levels\nvaried from a minimum of 240W to a maximum\nof 350W.\nThruster performance is outlined in Table 4.\nThe maximum specific impulse obtained was\n365s with a flow rate of 1.6x10 -5 kg/s and input\npower of 318.5W the minimum specific impulse\nobtained was 306s. at 237W input.\n\nThruster Starts\n\nFor initial thruster interface tests, the pulse\nof Figure 12a was selected. The pulse had a peak\namplitude of 2.8kV and a duration of\napproximately 30 \xc2\xb5s. This measurement was\ntaken at the thruster terminals on the feedthrough\nfor the vacuum facility and was a reasonable\nrepresentation of the pulse at the thruster\nelectrodes. The propellant mass flow rate for this\npulse was zero.\nA breakdown to are mode is shown in\nFigure 12b. For these tests the main converter\npower was off, which allowed the gas to be\nbroken down without an attempt to transition to\nan operational mode. The flow rate at this point\nwas was 2.1x10 -5 kg/sec. The gas broke down\nwith the pulse amplitude at approximately 2.4kV\nand the arc voltage after breakdown was 30-40V,\nindicating a normal low mode start. This arc\nvoltage was well below the open circuit voltage\nOf the PPU, thus, transition to normal operation\nwould be possible. The large current spike at\nbreakdown was measured to be 8A, but of 1\xc2\xb5s or\nless duration. This was likely due to energy\nstored in the parasitic capacitance of the power\ncable 24 and in the RC network in the PCU\noutput used for pulse smoothing. The arc current\nafter this spike was measured at 1.5A. In this\ninstance, the arc extinguished after 40\xc2\xb5s, which\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nA full bridge, phase shifted, pulse width\nmodulated power electronics unit for arcjets in\nthe 200-40OW power range was developed and\nsuccessfully integrated to an arcjet thruster. A\ntopology similar to that in the 5kW power range\nwas implemented, including a full bridge\nswitching circuit, current mode pulse width\nmodulated control, and an output current\naveraging inductor with an integral pulse\ngeneration winding. Reduction of switching\ntransients was accomplished using a low\ninductance power distribution network, and no\npassive snubber circuits were necessary for power\nFET protection. Phase shift control of the power\nbridge was accomplished using an improved\n\n5\n\nPWM to phase shift converter circuit. These\ndesign features, along with conservative\nmagnetics designs allowed power conversion\nefficiencies of greater than 92.5% to be achieved\ninto resistive loads over the entire operating\nrange of the converter. The addition of control\npower and EMI filtration would reduce the\nefficiency of a flight unit to 90%, corresponding\nto a spacecraft heat load of 33W for a 300W\noutput. Arcjet integration tests were performed\nwith simulated hydrazine propellant. Nondamaging starts and transitions to steady state\noperation of the thruster/PPU system were\nrepeatedly demonstrated. Specific impulses in the\nrange of 306-365 sec. were achieved at\nefficiencies of 0.40-0.32 respectively. Arc powers\nless than 240W were achieved.\n\nTR=(A+B)+OSC\nwhich resulted in 03 and 04 in phase with 01\nand 02 respectively if the pulse width of A or B\nwas zero. As the pulse duration of A or B\nincreased the phase angle of the signals increased,\nuntil the maximum phase angle on the order of\n180 degrees was achieved. This pulse train was\nused in conjunction with the gate signals 01 and\n02 to drive set/reset cell UTA. This generated the\nphase shifted drive signals 03 and 04. The\ntechnique of combining the trigger pulse with the\noutputs was used here also to prevent\nsimultaneous turn-on of the FETs on the phase\nshifted side. All gate drives were disabled by the\nrun switch, which also removed the input\nreference from the control circuit.\nREFERENCES\n\nAPPENDIX A\n1. John, R.R., Connors, J.F., and Bennet, S.,\n"Thirty Day Endurance Test of a 30 kW Arcjet\nEngine", AIAA Paper 63-274, June 1963.\n\nThis appendix discusses the operational\ndetails of the pulse width modulation to phase\nshift converter circuit of Figure 5. The\noperational logic levels of this circuit were\npresented in Figure Al. Note that the time scales\nfor the signals are not to scale and were changed\nto clarify the illustration. The PWM control chip\nprovided three outputs, an oscillator "OSC"\nwhich could be used to slave other control chips\nto the clock of the master controller and two\ndriver signals "A" and "B" used to control the\nFETs of a push-pull converter.\nThe signals A and B were already compatible\nwith standard CMOS logic, however, the OSC\nsignal from the controller was not. Conversion\nto CMOS logic levels was accomplished by\ncomparator U9. It was noted that rising edge of A\nor B occurred a few nanoseconds after the falling\nedge of the OSC signal, so an RC network was\nadded to the input of U9 to lengthen the input\npulse. The total duration of the input pulse was 1\n\xc2\xb5s. The output of U9 was used to trigger\nmonostable muldvibrator U413, which generated\na uniform 1 \xc2\xb5s pulse. This pulse train was then\nused to clock toggle flip-flop U1B which\ngenerated the drive signals 01 and 02 for the\nreference side of the bridge converter. It should be\nnoted that the drive signals for the power FETs\nare active low. To prevent simultaneous turn on\nof 01 and 02, the clock pulse to the flip-flop\nwas ORed with the outputs, which drove the\noutputs high while the flip-flop changed state.\nPhase shifting was accomplished by\ngenerating another pulse train with monostable\nmultivibrator U4A. This multivibrator was\ntriggered with the following signal:\n\n2.

Limited spacecraft power and thermal control capacity of these small spacecraft\nemphasized the need for high efficiency. Power topologies similar to those in the higher 2 kW and 5 to 30 kW power\nrange were implemented, including a four transistor bridge switching circuit, current mode pulse-width modulated\ncontrol, and an output current averaging inductor with an integral pulse generation winding. Reduction of switching\ntransients was accomplished using a low inductance power distribution network, and no passive snubber circuits were\nnecessary for power switch protection. Phase shift control of the power bridge was accomplished using an improved\npulse width modulation to phase shift converter circuit. These features, along with conservative magnetics designs\nallowed power conversion efficiencies of greater than 92.5% to be achieved into resistive loads over the entire operating range of the converter. Electromagnetic compatibility requirements were not considered in this work, and control\npower for the converter was derived from AC mains. Addition of input filters and control power converters would\nresult in an efficiency of on the order of 90% for a flight unit. Due to the developmental nature of arcjet systems at this\npower level, the exact nature of the thruster/power processor interface was not quantified. Output regulation and\ncurrent ripple requirements of 1 and 20% respectively, as well as starting techniques, were derived from the characteristics of the 2 kW system but an open circuit voltage in excess of 175 V was specified. Arcjet integration tests were\nperformed, resulting in successful starts and stable arcjet operation at power levels as low as 240 W with simulated\nhydrazine propellants.\n\n17.
