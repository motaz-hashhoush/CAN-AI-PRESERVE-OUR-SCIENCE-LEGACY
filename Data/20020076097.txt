b'Computer Technology\n\nManaging Satellites\nperating a satellite requires 24 hour-a-day, 7-daya-week tender loving care. Telemetry must be\nacquired routinely, and a watchful eye must be\never present to track and control a spacecraft.\nEPOCH 2000" is from the product line of Integral\nSystems, Inc. of Lanham, Maryland. This computer\nsoftware allows ground operators to monitor and control\nsatellites over a wide area network. The sofhvare\ndecreases the costs of managing satellites once in space\nby automating such functions as telemetry processing,\ncommanding, anomaly detection, and archiving\ncollected data.\nAs a third generation product from Integral\nSystems, EPOCH 2000 owes part of its heritage from\nwork the company completed to support Goddard Space\nFlight Center. A decade of valuable NASA experience\nwas incorporated into the company\'s EPOCH 2000\nproduct line for satellite command and control, says\nIntegral Systems vice president of commercial systems,\nSteven Carchedi.\nPerhaps most people think of satellite control\ncenters as large rooms, packed wall-to-wall with rows of\ndistressed technicians and giant number-crunching\ncomputers. EPOCH software is run from individual\nworkstations, tied together via a local area computer\nnetwork. These workstations operate in an office\nenvironment, meaning there is no need for an expensive\ncomputer room, power service, or cooling. There is no\nsingle point of failure as each workstation operates\nindependently. EPOCH software can be run on\nessentially any host computer and still maintain\ncommunicationswith all the other processing nodes.\n\nIntegral Systems, Inc. \'s EPOCH2000\nforms the core oofNASA\'sNear Earth\nAsteroid Rendezvous mission\'s command\nand controlgroundsystem. Managed by\ntheJohns Hopkins UniuersiiyApplied\nPbysics Laboratory, the satellite was\nIannched in Februay I996\n\nCommercial BenefitsSpinoifs\n\nThe system is designed to operate multiple satellites\nsimultaneously. Since EPOCH 2000 is completely\ndatabase driven, it can be used for any satellite or\nground station configuration.\nTo meet the NASA challenge, Integral Systems was\nselected by the Johns Hopkins University Applied\nPhysics Laboratory to support the first NASA Discovery-class mission: the Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous\n(NEAR) program. The rendezvous will take place in\nearly 1999 and the NEAR spacecraft will orbit the\nAsteroid Eros for a year. EPOCH 2000 forms the core\nof NEAR\'S command and control ground system back\non Earth.\nIntegral Systems was selected in November 1996 to\nprovide up to 15 Low Earth Orbit Autonomous Ground\nTerminal (LEO-Ts) for NASA. The LEO-T systems are\nto be delivered under contract to NASA\'s Wallops Flight\nFacility at Wallops Island, Virginia. The LEO-T is\ndesigned to make it easier and less expensive for\nprincipal investigators to obtain telemetry, tracking and\ncontrol services for their science missions.\nFounded in 1982, Integral Systems has grown to be\na leading provider of satellite command and control\nsystems to government and commercial customers, such\nas AT&T, GE Americom and TRW. Company revenues\nhave climbed to over $1 1 million, with over 100\nemployees working at its headquarters. Its commercialoff-the-shelf satellite software products have supported\nwell over 70 satellite missions aimed at scientific\nresearch, meteorology, or communications applications.\nTM EPOCH 2000 is a trademark of Integral Systems, Inc.\n\nI\n\nii\n1\n\n1\n\nI\n\n'
