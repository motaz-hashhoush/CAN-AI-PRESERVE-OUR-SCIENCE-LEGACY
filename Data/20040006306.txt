INTRODUCTION\nThis report summarizes the tasking contained in the Statement of Work and describes the results\nof the project. In addition, it addresses the principles, procedures, and methods of application that\nwould be generally applicable to using the results of the project.\n2. STATEMENT OF WORK\n\n2.1. Background\nNASA Glenn Research Center (GRC) is responsible for the Advanced Communications for Air\nTraffic Management (AC/ATM) Project, a sub-element task of the Advanced Air Transportation\nTechnologies (AATT) Project of the NASA Aviation System Capacity Program (ASC). The\nAC/ATM Project is developing new communications technologies and tools that will improve\nthroughput in the U.S. Air Traffic Control System.\nThe goal of the AC/ATM Project is to enable a communications infrastructure providing the\ncapacity, efficiency, and flexibility necessary to realize benefits of the future mature Free-Flight\nenvironment. The capabilities and scope of communications technologies needed to accomplish\nthis goal depend on characteristics of the future Free-Flight environment. There are many\noperational concepts being proposed for a future ATM system to enable user flexibility and\nefficiency.\nGRC\xe2\x80\x99s focus is on developing new technologies and techniques to support the digital\ncommunication of information involving airborne and ground-based users. However, the\ntechnologies and techniques must be integrated with the systems and services that industry and\nthe Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) are developing. Thus, GRC needs to monitor and\nprovide input to the various industry and FAA organizations and committees that are specifying\nnew systems and services.\nAdoption of technologies by the FAA is partially dependent on acceptance of the technology by\nthe aviation community. The commercial aviation community in particular would like to adopt\ntechnologies that can be used throughout the world. As a result, the adoption of common or at\nleast compatible technologies by European countries is a key factor in getting commitments to\nthose technologies by the US aviation community. GRC desires to keep informed of European\nactivities that relate to aviation communication technologies, particularly those that are being\nsupported by Eurocontrol.\n\n1\n\nIndustry Support\nTask Order 19 Final Technical Report\n\n2.2. Detailed Task Descriptions & Specific Work Elements\n\nGRC will participate with RTCA, Airline Electronics Engineering Committee (AEEC),\nEurocontrol, the iPAXS Task Force, the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), and other\ncommittees and working groups in shaping the aviation communications mechanisms. GRC has\na requirement for a contractor knowledgeable in this environment to augment its efforts. The\ncontractor shall perform the following tasks in support of GRC during Fiscal Year 2003.\n2.2.1. Industry Collaboration\n\nGRC intends to interact with the airline community and participate with RTCA, the AEEC,\nEurocontrol, the iPAX Task Force, the IETF, and other committees and working groups in\nshaping the communications mechanisms that will support the Air Traffic Control System in the\nUnited States.\nThe RTCA Special Committees that GRC intends to participate with as it relates to this task are:\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\nSC-189, Air Traffic Services Safety and Interoperability Requirements (ATS SIR)\nSC- 194, Air Traffic Management Data Link Implementation\nSC- 198, Next Generation Data Communications (NEXCOM)\nSC-186, Automatic Dependent Surveillance - Broadcast (ADS-B)\nRTCA Free Flight Steering Committee\n\nThe AEEC organizations are:\n0\n\n0\n\nATN Working Group\nData Link Workshop and Users Forum\n\nThe contractor shall attend meetings in support of the GRC representative. Occasionally, a GRC\nrepresentative may not be available and the contractor shall attend a meeting as the GRC\nrepresentative. The contractor will monitor the activities of industry and government committees\nrelated to aviation communications.\nThe contractor shall prepare and submit to the GRC Contracting Officers Technical\nRepresentative (COTR) a report that summaries key points about each meeting.\n2.2.2. Position Papers and Analysis\n\nTechnical issues that are raised at a standards committee meeting may require analysis. The\ncontractor will perform technical analysis and develop position papers for GRC. This may\nrequire technical collaboration with airlines, the FAA, the AEEC, Eurocontrol, the iPAX Task\nForce, the IETF, RTCA, NASA Research Centers, and other aviation related industry groups\nsuch as the National Business Aviation Association (NBAA) and the Aircraft Owners & Pilots\nAssociation (AOPA).\n\n2\n\nIndustry Support\nTask Order 19 Final Technical Report\n\n2.3.

PROJECT RESULTS\n\nTask Order 19 of NASA Contract NAS 3-99165 was conducted for the Industry Support task.\nThe goal of the project was to monitor the activities of industry and government committees that\nare shaping aviation communications mechanisms. This report covers activity executed during\nFiscal Year 2003.\n\n3.1. Industry Collaboration\nAs a part of this task, CNS participated with various RTCA subcommittees, Airline Electronics\nEngineering Committee (AEEC) subcommittees and working groups, Eurocontrol, and other\ncommittees and working groups in shaping the aviation communications mechanisms. CNS\nattended meetings of the RTCA Special Committees, SC-194, Air Traffic Management Data\nLink Implementation, SC-198, Next Generation Communications (NEXCOM), and SC-186,\nAutomatic Dependent Surveillance - Broadcast (ADS-B). CNS also met with and made\npresentations to iPAXEurocontro1. CNS monitored the activities of industry and government\ncommittees related to aviation communications. After each meeting, CNS prepared and\nsubmitted a report summarizing key points for the meeting (minutes).\nCNS continued to participate in the AEEC VHF Digital Link Subcommittee (VDL SC) to ensure\nthat NASA GRC, along with the NASA Langley Research Center, is involved in formulation of\nstandards. These standards are related to the airline\xe2\x80\x99s standards for ACARS, VDL Mode 2 Data\nLink, ACARS over Aviation VHF Link Control, Communications Management Unit (CMU) and\nthe Aeronautical Telecommunications Network (ATN). GRC is the only NASA organization\nwith continuous representation on the AEEC Aircraft Data Network Working Group. The ADN\nworking group is setting the direction of future aircraft data networks. This will be important to\nthe realization and acceptance of related domestic, satellite communications for the FFDAG-TM\nConcepts, AWIN, and other NASA programs such as SATS that are now in research and\ndevelopment. This is particularly true if the new approaches are to use an IETF based\ninternetworking architecture.\nIn support of this task, CNS attended the following meetings:\ne\n\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\ne\n\ne\ne\ne\ne\n\n10 - 13 Dec 02\n25 - 27 Mar 03\n10 Jun 03\n8 - 10 Oct 02\n13 - 14 NOV02\n21 -23 Jan03\n27 Jan 03\n11-13Feb03\n18-20Feb03\n11-13Mar03\n25 Mar 03\n\nRTCA SC-194:\nRTCA SC-194:\nRTCA SC-194:\nRTCA SC-198:\nRTCA SC-198:\nRTCA SC-198:\nRTCA SC-198:\nRTCA SC-198:\nRTCA SC-198:\nRTCA SC-198:\nRTCA SC-198:\n\n4\n\nIndustry Support\nTask Order 19 Final Technical Report\n\nRTCA SC-198:\nRTCA SC-198:\nRTCA SC-186:\nRTCA SC-186:\nRTCA SC- 186:\nRTCA SC-189:\nRTCA Symposium:\nRTCA Spring Forum:\nRTCA Joint Coordinating Committee\nRTCA PMC for NEXCOM SPR\nRTCA PMC for NEXCOM SPR\nAEEC ADN 664:\nAEEC ADN 664:\nAEEC ADN 664:\nAEEC ADN 664:\nAEEC ADN 664:\nAEEC ADN 664:\nAEEC ADN 664:\nAEEC DL Users Forum\nAEEC DLS:\nAEEC DLS:\nAEEC DLS:\nAEEC DLS:\nAEEC VDL SC:\nAEEC VDL SC:\nAEEC ATN 637:\niPAX/EUROCONTROL:\n3'd ICNS 2003 Conference\nNExTNAS CNS Workshop\n2 1st Digital Avionics Systems Conference:\n\n5\n\n29 Apr 03\n25 Sep 03\n30 - 31 Jan 03\n23 - 24 Apr 03\n25 - 26 Jun 03\n23 - 27 Juri 03\n26-28Feb03\n24 Jun 03\n13 Dec 02\n21 Jan 03\n25 Jun 03\n9 - 14 NOV02\n7 - 29 Jan 03\n9-13Mar03\n22 May 03\n3-5J~n03\n24-27Jun03\n19 - 20 Aug 03\n4 - 7 Feb 03\n3 - 7 Dec 02\n14 - 16 May 03\n15 - 16 Jul 03\n8 - 10 Sep 03\n12-13May03\n11-12Sep03\n14 - 17 Oct 02\n23 May 03\n19 - 22 May 03\n20 - 21 Aug 03\n27 - 31 Oct 02\n\nIndustry Support\nTask Order 19 Final Technical Report\n\n3.2.
