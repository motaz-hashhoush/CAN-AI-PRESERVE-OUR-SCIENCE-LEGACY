However, theoretical models of large icosahedral fullerenes predict highly faceted shapes for molecules with more than a few hundred atoms. This discrepancy in shape may be explained by the presence of defects during the formation of carbon onions. Here, we use the semi-empirical tight-binding method for carbon to simulate the incorporation of pentagon-heptagon defects on to the surface of large icosahedral fullerenes. We show a simple mechanism that results in energetically competitive derivative structures and a global change in molecular shape from faceted to round. Our results provide a plausible explanation of the apparent discrepancy between experimental observations of round buckyonions and theoretical predictions of faceted icosahedral fullerenes.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19980002695, "id": "3607a598108c483294387de45d064ad2", "publicationDate": "1997-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19980002695.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19980002695/downloads/19980002695.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19980002695/downloads/19980002695.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19980002695/downloads/19980002695.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
