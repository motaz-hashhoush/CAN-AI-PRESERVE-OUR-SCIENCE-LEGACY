For cartographic\nuse, the most valuable sensor is the photographic system, and a key\ncomponent of this system which largely determines its capability to\nrecord fine detail is the lens/film combination. The performance of\nthis combination is expressed in terms of resolution. Resolution of\nthe input imagery is an important factor in the analysis of a photogrammetric system, especially a system using space photography.\nAs the stereoplotting instrument is an integral part of the total\nphotogrammetric system, its limitations must be considered when\nstudying the capabilities of the total system. The performance of a\nstereoplotter can be expressed in terms of its height-measuring\ncapabilities.\nTherefore, in this study, the effectiveness of various photogrammetric systems was analyzed on the bases of static film resolution\nand height-measuring capability of stereoplotters. The results of\nthis analysis are summarized in the enclosed chart (Appendix 1).\n2.\n2.1\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nDefinitions\n\nThe fpllowing terms used in this study are defined to assist\nthe reader in understanding the procedure and to clarify the results\nlisted in the accompanying chart. Many of the definitions are\nWritten in context with this particular study and should not be\nconstrued as classic definitions accepted by the photogrammetric\ncommunity.\nResolution is the minimum center-to-center distance between\ntwo adjacent discernible features, or the minimum size of a\nfeature on imagery produced by a sensing system. For photography, this distance is usually expressed in lines per\nmillimeter recorded on a particular film under specific\nconditions.\n\nStatic film resolution of a system is a value representing\nthe maximum number of lines per millimeter recorded on the\nfilm under laboratory conditions.\nTheoretical ground resolution is the size of the smallest\nobject that would be recorded by a sensing system of a\ngiven static film resolution if the imagery were not\naffected by factors introduced under operational conditions;\nthat is, it is the distance on the ground represented by\none line pair.\nTheoretical contour interval is the minimum contour interval\nthat can be practically measured based on the theoretical\nground resolution only.\nTheoretical Ofactbr is the ratio of the flight height to\nthe theoretical contour interval.\nInstrument contour interval is the value of the contour\ninterval as represented at the instrument scale.\nBase-height ratio is the ratio between the air base or\ndistance between successive exposure stations and the\nflight height.\nInstrument system Ofactor is the ratio between the flight\nheight and the minimum contour interval which can be drawn\nfrom that height with a particular instrument system. In\noperational mapping this is affected by the photographic\nconditions, personnel involved in the plotting, and\ncondition of equipment.\nModel scale is the scale at which the stereoscopic model is\nviewed in a double-projection instrument.\n2.2\n\nApproach\n\nThe known static film resolution produced by various photographic\nsystems is used as a basis for comparisons in this study. In order\nthat the performance of each system can be equally compared, two\nrationale are assumed: 1) all photographic systems have geometric\nfidelity equal to that of a metric camera; and 2) ground resolution\ndeteriorates uniformally as the flight height increases. Utilization\nof these two rationale will support formulation of logical conclusions,\neven though the scope of this investigation is limited.\n\nThe measuring capability of a double-projection plotter with a\n6-inch principal distance and a 760-iran projection distance is used\nas a basis for evaluating the performance of compilation instruments.\nBecause of the known capabilities of this type of plotter, more valid\nextrapolations regarding the use of orbital-height photographs can be\nmade.\nBecause 12- and 24-inch-principal-distance plotters are believed\nto be the most efficient instruments for compiling with 12- and 24-inch\nfocal-length photographs, the capabilities of these plotters have also\nbeen considered in this study.\n3.\n\nPROCEDURE\n\nThe average static film resolution in lines per millimeter are\nlisted as known data for various state-of-the-art lens/film combinations.\nThe theoretical ground resolution is computed by converting one line\npair at negative scale to feet or meters on the ground. This value\nrepresents the size of the smallest object which can be accurately\ndiscerned. Five times the theoretical ground resolution is considered\nto be the minimum contour interval (theoretical contour interval)\nwhich could be accurately drawn. This is a reasonable assumption based\non the absolute accuracy obtainable with photogrammetry assuming adequate\nheight measuring capability. Yet it is conservative enough to allow for\nhuman factors which tend to reduce the precision of photogrammetric\nmeasurements. The theoretical C-factor is computed by dividing the\nflight height by the theoretical contour interval, and the instrument\ncontour interval is the value of the theoretical contour interval at\nthe model scale of the stereoplotter.\n4.\n\nRESULTS\n\nAppendix 1 shows the results of this study. A significant item\nis the small instrument contour interval which would result from the\nuse of photographs taken at 200 km. with a 24-inch-focal-length camera\ngiving 1.6-M ground resolution. The resulting 0.122-mm instrument\ncontour interval is smaller than the practical minimum for present\nphotogrammetric stereoplotters. A minimum instrument contour interval\nof approximately 0.45 mm is necessary for accurate plotting based on\nprevious tests. Parallel situations develop for photographs taken at\n200 km with a 24-inch camera giving 3.3-M ground resolution and for\nphotographs taken at 80 km with a 12-inch camera giving 1.75-M and 3.5-M\nground resolution. In each case an instrument contour interval is\nselected which would be feasible for compilation purposes.\n\n5.\n5.1\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nMathematical Approach\n\nA mathematical approach which emphasizes the mean square error\nin measurements of parallax in the image plane and gives reasonable\ncorrelation with the theoretical-ground-resolution approach is as\nfollows:\nMATHEMATICAL DERIVATION OF EXPECTED ACCURACY (ROOT-MEAN-SQUARE ERROR)\nIN DERIVED ELEVATIONS USING PROPOSED SYSTEMS AND DESIGNATED VARIATIONS\n2\nUH = 2uoZ (4.35 - 1.25N + 0.375N2 - 0.0625N3 + 0.015625N4 )l/2*\nBf\nwhere u^ = Expected elevation accuracy (root-mean-square error)\nu\n\n= The accuracy (mean-square error) of the measurement of\nparallax in the image plane. The value of UQ is in the\norder of 0.01 mm in modern photogrammetric systems of\naverage precision (0.005 mm in highly precise systems).\nFor this study a figure of 0.0075 mm will be used.\nZ = H = Average flight height above ground.\nB = Average length of aerial base.\nN = Number of models\nf = Principal distance of the camera\n\n*(The formula for determining the expected accuracy in derived\nelevations of aerotriangulated points is from "Studies in\nSpatial Aerotriangulation" by Professor H. M. Karara,\nUniversity of Illinois Bulletin, August 1963.)\nNational map accuracy standards specify that 90% of well defined \'\npoints must be correct within one-half contour interval. Since 90% of\nthe values in a normal error distribution lie within 1.65 standard\ndeviations, the indicated allowable contour interval is equal to twice\nthe product of 1.65 and the standard deviation. In this case the rootmean-square error is the standard deviation.\n\n5.2\n\nEvaluation of results\n\nThe contour intervals which would be feasible from a mathematical\napproach and the contour intervals developed from the theoretical-groundresolution approach are compared in the table below to show the\ncorrelation between the two methods. A base-height ratio of 0.63 is\nused for the computations.\nCONTOUR INTERVALS\n\nFlight\nHeight\n24,000\n120,000\n80\n200\nTable 1.\n\nExpected Elevation\nAccuracy (RMSE)\nft.\nft.\nkm\nkm\n\n8.0\n40.0\n13.1\n16.4\n\nft.\nft.\nM\nM\n\nBy\nMathematical\nApproach\n26\n132\n44\n55\n\nft.\nft.\nM\nM\n\nBy TheoreticalGround-Resolution\nApproach\n20\n80\n36\n66\n\nft.*\nft.*\nM\nM\n\nContour intervals based on the mathematical approach and\nthe theoretical-ground-resolution approach.\n\n*This is in agreement with the empirical value.\nThe figures shown in this table, although theoretical in nature,\nare based on extrapolations from long-term production results with 6-inch\nplotters and can be used to evaluate space photography for cartographic\napplications.\nIn this theoretical context we can consider a direct-projection\nplotter which has a 24-inch principal distance and a 10-foot projection\ndistance. According to the theoretical-resolution approach such a\nplotter would have an 8-meter contour-interval capability with 200 I/mm\nresolution and a flight height of 200 kilometers; by the mathematical\napproach this system would be capable of measuring within a standard\ndeviation of 3.65 M and would be appropriate for drawing 12 meter contours\n5.3\n\nFormat\n\nIt is not the intent of this limited study to set up specifications\nfor compilation plotters but the format requirements necessary for\noptimum results for 24- and 12-inch-principal-distance projectors under\nthe conditions set forth in the chart should be of interest. The 24-inch\nprincipal distance plotter would need a 36-inch-long format and the\n12-inch principal distance plotter would require an 18-inch format to\nmaintain strong intersection of conjugate image rays (B/H \xc2\xab= 0.63) in the\nstereomodel.\n\n5.4\n\nPlanimetric Compilation\n\nAnother restricting factor that must be considered in mediumscale mapping is the so called P-factor. In the U.S. it is necessary\nwith the 6-inch mapping cameras presently in general use to confine\nflight height to 15,000 feet or less in the eastern areas and to\n18,700 feet or less in the western areas in order to be able to\ninterpret planimetric detail for l:24,000-scale mapping. If 6-inch ;\nphotographs taken from a mean altitude of 16,500 feet is considered\nto be a requirement for planimetric compilation, a theoretical ground\nresolution of 2.75 feet is needed. The theoretical ground resolution\nof photographs taken from an orbital height of 200 km with a 24-inch\nfocal length camera system capable of resolving 200 lines per\nmillimeter is computed to be 5.25 feet. Therefore, such photographs\nwould not be suitable for l:24,000-scale compilation of planimetry.\n6.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nIt is obvious from this study that longer-principal-distance\nplotters offer advantages over the standard 6-inch-principal-distance\nplotters in producing larger model scales and smaller-contour-interval\ncapabilities. With a 24-inch principal-distance plotter it is feasible\nto compile 30-meter contours from 200-km earth-orbital photographs\ntaken with a 24-inch metric camera system delivering a resolution of\n100 lines per millimeter or more. However, due to the small model\nscale and insufficient resolution, this system would not be conducive\nto accurate l:24,000-scale mapping. But it should be adequate for\ncompiling 1:250,000-scale and possibly l:62,500-scale maps.\nIn the lunar case it is feasible to compile 25-meter contours\nfrom photographs taken with a 12-inch-focal-length metric camera\nprovided that a minimum resolution of 75 lines per millimeter is\nobtained. Resolution greater than 75 lines per millimeter will not\nincrease the minimum-contour-interval capability because of the small\ninstrument scale.\n7.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS\n\nIn view of these conclusions it is recommended that further studies\nbe made of compilation instrumentation with the goal of solving the\nscale problem presented by orbital photography so that maximum benefits\n\nmay accrue from its utilization. It is further recommended that every\neffort be made to obtain 24-inch photographs from earth-orbital heights\nexposed under optimum conditions so that system-performance capabilities\nfor cartographic applications may be determined from an analysis of the\nactual system product.\n\na\n\nIB\n\na.\nc\no\n\n(B\n\nii\n\nca\n\n\xc2\xa3T*\n\nft)\n-a\n\n11\n\nrt\nO\n00\n\no\n\n3"\n\na\n\n3\nI 1\n\nH00\nH-\n\nO\nI\nZ\nO\nrt\n\nH\nIB\n\n(B\n\na\nIB\n11\n\nCO\nH-\n\nO\n00\n1\nft)\n\nIT\nrt\n\nrt\nO\nO\n\nCO\n\nO\nO\n3\n\nCD\nCO\n\nrt\n\nCO\n\nH-\n\nrt\n(B\n\nc\nCD\n\nIB\n\na\n\nft)\n\n3\n\nP)\n\na\n\nIB\n\nIB\n\na\n\n3\nCO\ni/j\xc2\xbb\n\na\nft)\nrt\nft)\n\nn\no\n\n^1\nI\nI-1\n\nrt\nH-\n\na\nIB\n3\n\nrt\n11\n\nCO\n\n3\n\n^J.\n\np]\nm\no\n3\'\n\n;\n\n""\n\n=\n\n= Ui\nB\n\nm\n3\n\nto\n^\nUi\n\nI-- OJ\n\nON ro\nO O\nO O\n\nON ro\nO O\nO O\n\nON\n*\nO\nO\n\no\n\nro\nUi\n*.\n= O\n0\n\nB\n\nB\n\n(ON\n\n=00\n\n2\n\n^J\n\n^>J\n\nM\n\no o\no o\n\n*vj\n\n>\n\nH" ON\n\nro oj\no o\nB 3\n\nro ON ON ro ON ON\nro\xc2\xbb - to. .\n\no o\no o\n\n**J\n\nW\n\nt-1 ON\n\nro oj\no o\n33\n\nillii-1 i i\\<->\n**. ^.\n\n.p- i \'\n; Ui ls>\n\no o\n\nI-1\nto\n*\n= Ul\nO\n\n3 B\n\n(-> OJ\n= ON OJ\n\nB B\n\nOJ ON\n\nP" P\' rO\nUi Ui 4S\n\no\n\nOJ\n>.\nO\nO\n\nB\n\nON\nON\n\nB\n\nr\n\nOJ ON\nrO\n\nOJ\n\nON Ul Ui ON Ul Ui\n\n\xc2\xb0I M\n*--\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1 \'\n\ni>~\n\nI 1\n\nI 1\n\nON to rO ON to ro\n\ni>~\n\nC^\n\n0\n\nUl Ul\n\nl>- - j>\nON \xc2\xa3* -P* ON\n\n0\n\n= 4>\n\no o o o o o\no o o o o o\n\nUl Ul .\n\n.\n\nUl *\n*\nUl . .\n.\nUl Ui \xc2\xbb\nUi Ui\n\no o o o o o\no o o o o o\n\nO ro ro o ro ro\n\nh^ Ul Ul 1 \xc2\xbb Ul Ul\n\n. .\n\nI-1 OJ\n\n. .\n\n3 3\n\nB B\n\n\'\n\n.O i-i\n\no\n\n~ ^J\nO\n\nW\n\nvo\n\ns\n\nco\n\nB\n\nm\n\n= -vj\nui\n\nUi ro\nO Oi\n\n\')(_.\n^-\n\n4S OJ\n\no\n\n~ O^\nO\n\nM\n\n^>\n\n-vj\n\nUi to\nO Ui\n\no\n\nZ\n\n(-\n\nOJ\n\nB\n\nO\n\n\xc2\xab*j\n\nI-"\n\n~\n\nOJ\n\n2\n\nro\n= O\nO\n\nI \'\nUi\n" O\n\nB\n\nW\n\nro\n\nOJ\n\ni-1\n\nB\n\nON\n\n= -P-\n\n~ ^J\n" Ui\n\nl_i\n\nui\n\n=\n\nl-i\n- O Ui\nO O\n\n=\n\nro\nUi\n\n=\n\n0\nO\nO\n\n=\n\n=\n\nr\n\nto\no\n= = = = = o\n\nEARTH MODE\nContour Info.\n\n0\nO\nO\n\n=\n\nUi\n\nvl\n\nOJ\n\xc2\xabvl\n\n=\n\n. rO\nON\n= rO\n\nS\n^ -\'\nI\n\nUl\n\n= = = = = o\n\nOJ\n\n= = = = = ro\n\nS"\n\n= = = = = o\n\n00\n\nMOON MODE\nContour Info.\n\n= ON\n\n4>\nO\nO\n\nrt\n\nto\n\n<\n\n(-\n\nHM\n\nH\n3"\nCD\nO\nM\nII\n\n=\n\n= ON\n\n.\n\nON oo\no o o\no o o\no\n\n00 -\n\n!c- lo \'*\n\nui ro ro\no o o\no o o\n\n1\' 1\' I \'\n...\n\nOO to l->\n000\n\n3\n\nO\n\n3 a\nrt\nrt\n\n(-" IB\nIB I-1\n\nr> O\ncu a\n\nto S\n\nft) rt\nO 1\nrt C\n\nTJ CO\n\ni\n\no M\n\n3~\na\n\nM O\n\npa\no\nO IB\n\nc\n\nCO\n\nn s\n\n.\nUl ON ON\n\n11\n\n.\n\n000\n\nrt\nO\n\no\n\nCo O\n\nMl\n\nIB\n11\n\n^\n\n1 ff\n\n0 H\n\nCo Ui\nX\n\n(B\n\npa -\n\nH\n\no o\n\nH\n31\nIB\n0\n\nIB\nCO\n\ni sr\nn\npa o\n\n0 H\n\nCO\n\nH- B\nIB\n^ pa\n\nO\n0,\n\nto ^\n\nTO 0\n\nIB\n\nZ rt\n\n*-s ft)\n\nIB\n\nft) rt\'\n!I-1\n\nZ\n\nO\n0\nCo\nt->\n\n\'\n\n"-\n\nf\nH00\nff\nrt\n\nIB\nto 00\nO CO\n\n(B\n3\nTO\nrt\n\n(B\nI-1TO\n3"\nrt\n\nui ro ro\no o o\n\n...\n\n1 \' h-\' I-J\n\no o o\n\nOO tO h-1\n\nI-1\nON .\xc2\xa3 to\n- _ .\n\nUi 4> .p000\n\no\n\no o o\n\nP- 00\n0- O\nO O\n\nNJ ^ ro\n\nI-1 t-> h-1\n\n=\n\nro ro M\no 4> ro\n000\no o o\no o o\n\nKNOWN PARA.\nContour Info.\n\n3\n5\n\ne\n\nM\n\n^\n\ni-3\n\n_4\n\no\n\n/I\nto\n\nZ\nO\n\nXI\n\n1\n\nw\n-3\n\nd\n\n3\n7]\npa\n\n90\nM\nO\n-d\n\nH\n\nH\n\nS\n\ng\n^\nIT\n1-\n\n3J\npc\n\n^\n\nO\n\nB M\n\no \xc2\xa7\nI- Kj\nc\n\npe to\nIB H\nco c\n\n'
