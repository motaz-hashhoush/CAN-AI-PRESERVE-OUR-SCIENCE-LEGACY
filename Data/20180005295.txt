The length of the weather interruption is one of the main influences determining the size of the\nstorage needed to save the data to be sent at a later time. This analysis uses the Markov chain probabilities\nfor weather to determine how many cloudy or rainy time steps in a row will not allow data transmission.\nThe mean and standard deviation are computed, which along with the average data rate to be sent can be\nused to help size storage buffers in which to save data between periods of good weather.\n\nNomenclature\nRF\n\nradiofrequency\n\nSymbols\na\nA\nB\nn\nN\np\nP\nP(A)\nP(A\xe2\x88\xa9 B)\n\navailability ratio\nevent A\nevent B\nnumber of time steps\nnumber of time steps before success or failure can be determined\nspeed-up factor\nprobability function of a specified event\nprobability of occurrence of event A\nprobability of occurrence of both event A and event B at same time; that is, intersection of the\ntwo events\nP(A\xe2\x88\xaa B) probability of occurrence of either event A or event B at same time; that is, union of the two\nevents\nP(B)\nprobability of event B\nPr[x,y]\nprobability of weather y (0 or 1) at the current time step given weather x (0 or 1) at the\nprevious time step\naverage data rate per time step\nRd\nX\ntotal minutes in an average duty cycle\nY\navailable minutes in an average duty cycle\n\xcf\x83\nstandard deviation of number of time steps in a row of bad weather\n\xcf\x83\xc2\xb2\nvariance of number of time steps in a row of bad weather\n\xce\xa3\nsummation from lower to upper limit\n\xe2\x88\x86T\nsize of each time step\n\xce\xbc\naverage number of time steps in a row of bad weather\naverage number of time steps in a row of good weather\n\xce\xbcgood\n\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942018-219927\n\n1\n\n2.0\n\nBuffer Sizing\n\n2.1\n\nMarkov Probabilities\n\nThis paper uses the Markov chain probabilities for weather, where the weather at the next time step\ndepends only on the weather at the current time step. This paper will determine the probabilities for how\nmany time steps in a row will not allow data transmission. Using the values for how long data cannot be\ntransmitted due to weather, buffer size will be computed to hold the data not transmitted.\nThe transmission frequency determines whether cloudy weather or rainy weather can block\ntransmission. For a radiofrequency (RF) transmitter and/or receiver combination, rain would block the\nsignals but mere cloudiness would not. For an optical transmitter and/or receiver combination, cloudiness\nwould block the signal. Optically, rain is not treated separately since it rarely appears without clouds.\nAlthough it is possible to have various levels of cloudy or rainy in the Markov chain model, only two\nlevels were used to simplify the model. The levels are clear to allow signals to pass and either cloudy or\nrainy that blocks the signals.\nThe Markov chain uses state transition probabilities. In this case, the probabilities are determined for\nthe change from clear at one time step to cloudy or rainy at the following time step and vice versa. These\nstates are denoted by 0 and 1, with 0 for rainy or cloudy, and 1 for clear.\nThe definitions of the transition probabilities are explained as follows:\n\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n\nPr[0,0] is the probability of cloudy or rainy given cloudy or rainy at the previous time step.\nPr[0,1] is the probability of clear given cloudy or rainy at the previous time step.\nPr[1,0] is the probability of cloudy or rainy given clear at the previous time step.\nPr[1,1] is the probability of clear given clear at the previous time step.\n\nIt is assumed that there are no intermediate states, so it must either be clear or be cloudy or rainy at\neach time step, regardless of the value at the previous time step. Thus, the probabilities add up to 1:\nPr[0,0] + Pr[0,1] =\n1\n\n(1)\n\nPr[1,0] + Pr[1,1] =\n1\n\n(2)\n\nThe mean and standard deviation of the number of bad weather time steps in a row can be used to\nhelp size storage buffers to save data between periods of clear weather.\nThe buffer sizing may be estimated by Monte Carlo simulation or computation. For simulation, the\ninitial weather state is computed at each Earth terminal randomly. It should not matter which type of\nweather is at the start because if there was a higher likelihood of one type of weather over the other, the\nweather would soon change according to the Markov probabilities specified. To eliminate any bias\nintroduced by this assumption at this initial point, the initial state is ignored as far as any data\ntransmission is concerned.\nFor the next time step, the probability of a cloudy or rainy time period is computed, given the\nprevious time period\xe2\x80\x99s weather state at each Earth terminal. This probability is used to determine the\nweather state using a random variable. That step is repeated by storing the current weather state so that it\ncan be tested by the next step as the previous weather state.\nStatistics are computed for the number of each type of weather period, the amount of data lost or\nreceived during each period, the sequential number cloudy or rainy time steps, and percentages.\n\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942018-219927\n\n2\n\n2.2\n\nProbabilities of Length of Bad Weather\n\nThe rest of this paper uses the Markov probabilities for weather to determine how many cloudy or\nrainy time steps are likely in a row. The probabilities allow the weather to change gradually from the\ninitial conditions, using intermediate values. The transition probabilities are assumed to remain constant\nlong enough for the computations to be reasonably valid. The fact that some locations have a rainy or dry\nseason during which the probabilities change is not taken into account here.\nThe mean and standard deviation of the number of time steps in a row of bad weather can be used to\nhelp size storage buffers to save data between periods of good weather. In Equation (3), probabilities are\ncomputed for each number of bad weather periods in a sequence.\nThe probability of n steps in a row of type 0 is as follows. For the probability of 1 exactly; that is,\nprobability of 0 then 1 is\nP(1) = Pr[0,1]\n\n(3a)\n\nFor the probability of 2 exactly; that is, probability of 0 then 0 then 1 is\nP(2) = Pr[0,0]Pr[0,1]\n\n(3b)\n\nFor the probability of 3 exactly; that is, probability of 0 then 0 then 0 then 1 is\nP(3) = Pr[0,0]Pr[0,0]Pr[0,1]\n\n(3c)\n\nFor the probability of 4 exactly; that is, probability of 0 then 3 more 0\xe2\x80\x99s then 1 is\n\nP(4) = Pr[0,0]3 Pr[0,1]\n\n(3d)\n\nOr more generally, for the probability of n exactly; that is, probability of 0 then (n\xe2\x80\x931) more 0\xe2\x80\x99s then 1 is\n\nP(n) = Pr[0,0]n \xe2\x88\x921 Pr[0,1]\n\n(3e)\n\nThe probability for each number of bad weather time steps in a row is used to compute the mean and\nstandard deviation of the number of bad weather time steps in a row, which are used to compute the\namount of data lost during each period of bad weather.\n\n2.3\n\nAverage\n\nThe expected value of the number of bad weather time steps in a row (0\xe2\x80\x99s in a row), denoted by \xc2\xb5, is\nobtained by summing the number of 0\xe2\x80\x99s in a row multiplied by its probability, P(n):\n\xe2\x88\x9e\n\n\xe2\x88\x91 n Pr[0,0]n\xe2\x88\x921 Pr[0,1]\n\n\xc2\xb5=\n\n(4)\n\nn =1\n\nThe summation will converge when the probabilities are less than 1. The successive terms start\ndecreasing when\n\nn Pr[0,0]n \xe2\x88\x921 Pr[0,1] > (n + 1) Pr[0,0]n Pr[0,1]\n\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942018-219927\n\n3\n\n(5)\n\nSince the probabilities are positive, divide both sides by {Pr[0,0]n\xe2\x88\x921 Pr[0,1]} to obtain\nn > (n + 1) Pr[0,0]\n\n(6)\n\nSubtracting {n Pr[0,0]} from both sides and solving for n results in\nn>\n\nPr[0,0]\n(1 \xe2\x88\x92 Pr[0,0])\n\n(7)\n\nSince this value of n may be large when the terms start decreasing and convergence may actually\nhappen much later, it is better to solve Equation (4) in closed form. This may be done similar to the proof\nfor the sum of a geometric series.\nEquation (4) can be written as\n\n= 1Pr[0,1] + 2 Pr[0,0]Pr[0,1] + 3Pr[0,0]2 Pr[0,1] + \xef\x81\x8b + (n + 1) Pr[0,0]n Pr[0,1] + \xef\x81\x8b\n\xc2\xb5\n\n(8)\n\nMultiply Equation (8) by Pr[0,0] and line up the exponents:\n\n= Pr[0,0]Pr[0,1] + 2 Pr[0,0]2 Pr[0,1] + \xef\x81\x8b + n Pr[0,0]n Pr[0,1] + \xef\x81\x8b\n\xc2\xb5 Pr[0,0]\n\n(9)\n\nThen subtract the two equations:\n\n\xc2\xb5 \xe2\x88\x92 \xc2\xb5 Pr[0,0] Pr[0,1] + Pr[0,0]Pr[0,1] + Pr[0,0]2 Pr[0,1] + \xef\x81\x8b + Pr[0,0]n Pr[0,1] + \xef\x81\x8b\n=\n\n(10)\n\nChanging notation, Equation (10) may be expressed as\n\xc2\xb5 \xe2\x88\x92 \xc2\xb5 Pr[0,0] =\n\n\xe2\x88\x9e\n\n\xe2\x88\x91 n=1 Pr[0,0]n\xe2\x88\x921 Pr[0,1]\n\n(11)\n\nBut the right-hand side can be shown to be equal to 1, either by summing the pieces of Equation (3)\nbecause the probabilities have to add up to 1 or by going back to the sum of a geometric series and using\nPr[0,0]= 1 \xe2\x88\x92 Pr[0,1] ; that is\n\xe2\x88\x9e\n\n=\n\xe2\x88\x91 n=1 Pr[0,0]n\xe2\x88\x921 Pr[0,1]\n\nPr[0,1]\nPr[0,1]\n= = 1\n1 \xe2\x88\x92 Pr[0,0] Pr[0,1]\n\n(12)\n\nSolving Equation (11) for \xc2\xb5 after substituting Equation (12):\n\n1\n1\n=\n1 \xe2\x88\x92 Pr[0,0] Pr[0,1]\n\n=\n\xc2\xb5\n\n2.4\n\n(13)\n\nStandard Deviation\n\nThe standard deviation is done similarly.

This size may\nbe improved by compression, depending on the type of data possibly with some tradeoffs in timing.\n2.5.2\n\nBuffer Size Adequacy\n\nThis buffer size may not be adequate if the good weather period is not long enough to send the data\naccumulated during the bad weather period. Equation (13) specifies \xc2\xb5 for bad weather, but there is a\ncorresponding \xc2\xb5good for good weather. Similar to Equation (4), the expected value of the number of time\nsteps in a row of good weather (1\xe2\x80\x99s in a row), denoted by \xc2\xb5good, is obtained by summing the number of 1\xe2\x80\x99s\nin a row by its probability:\n\xe2\x88\x9e\n\n\xe2\x88\x91 n=1\n\n\xc2\xb5good = n Pr[1,1]n \xe2\x88\x921 Pr[1,0]\n\n(29)\n\nAs in the analysis above, it can be found to be\n\n\xc2\xb5=\ngood\n\n1\n1\n=\n1 \xe2\x88\x92 Pr[1,1] Pr[1,0]\n\n(30)\n\nThe data keep accumulating during periods of bad weather, even if periods of good weather intervene,\nunless the bad weather outlasts the good by enough that the transmission of both the new and stored data\ncannot be accomplished. The transmission of the stored data does not have to be accomplished at the\nsame rate as the data is transmitted in real time due to preformatting, precompression, data access, and so\non. The usual data rate may not be the maximum data rate possible when sending the saved data. Let p be\nthe speed-up factor, if any, applied to speed up transmission of saved data during good weather. A value\nof 1 indicates no speed up. A value of less than 1 is actually a slowdown. There is a likely to be a problem\nwhen the amount of data that can be sent in the good weather at the speed-up rate is insufficient to\ntransmit the stored data as shown by the inequality in data size units:\n\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942018-219927\n\n6\n\n\xc2\xb5good \xe2\x88\x86T ( pRd ) < \xc2\xb5 \xe2\x88\x86T Rd\n\n(31)\n\nDividing both sides of the previous equation by (\xce\x94T Rd ), there is likely to be a problem when\n\np\xc2\xb5good < \xc2\xb5\n\n(32)\n\nSubstituting Equations (13) and (30) into the previous equation results in\n\np\n1\n<\nPr[1,0] Pr[0,1]\n\n(33)\n\np Pr[0,1] < Pr[1,0]\n\n(34)\n\nMultiplying both sides by Pr[0,1] Pr[1,0] is\n\nTherefore, there is a likely problem when p times the probability of good weather given bad weather\nat the previous time step is less than the probability of bad weather given good weather at the previous\ntime step. The higher the value of p, the greater the speed up, the less likely for there to be a problem with\nnot having enough good weather.\nFurthermore, the good weather may have to outlast the bad on average by enough to send both new\nand old data. The above assumes that sending can be done in parallel with no additional time taken.\n2.5.3\n\nCyclic Schedule Delays\n\nThere may also be scheduling delays due to other priorities, a daily duty cycle, power constraints,\nheat dissipation, orbital dynamics, and so on. These are not considered here in detail but could add to the\ntime before the data can be sent, increasing the buffer size beyond the 3\xcf\x83 value due to weather. For\nexample, if the orbit and daily duty cycle are such that the signal can only be scheduled every Y available\nminutes out of every X minutes, it can only send for Y/X of the time and saves data (X \xe2\x80\x93 Y)/X of the time,\nregardless of the weather.\nInstead of just the weather, the probabilities would have to reflect both the good weather and the\navailability of both the transmitter and receiver. Since the schedule is usually set up in advance, the\nweather may be considered independent of the schedule. Using the theorem for the joint probability of\nindependent events,\nP(A\xe2\x88\xa9 B) = P(B)\nP(A)\n\n(35)\n\nwhere P(A) is the probability of occurrence of event A, P(B) is the probability of event B, and P(A\xe2\x88\xa9 B)\nis the probability of occurrence of both event A and event B at the same time; that is, the intersection of\nthe two events, then the probability that the signal can get through is equal to the product of the\nprobability that the transmitter and/or receiver is available times the probability that the weather is good.\nLet a = Y/X, the availability ratio. The probability that the transmitter and/or receiver is available is a. The\nprobabilities that the weather is good when the transmitter and/or receiver is available are\nPr \xe2\x80\xb2[0,1] = a Pr[0,1]\n\nand\n\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942018-219927\n\n7\n\n(36)\n\nPr \xe2\x80\xb2[1,1] = a Pr[1,1]\n\n(37)\n\nThe other equations are computed using those values so that as before\n\n1\n\xc2\xb5\xe2\x80\xb2 =\nPr \xe2\x80\xb2[0,1]\n\n(38)\n\n\xcf\x832 =\xc2\xb5\xe2\x80\xb2(\xc2\xb5\xe2\x80\xb2 \xe2\x88\x92 1)\n\n(39)\n\nand\n\nSince \xce\xbc\xe2\x80\xb2 is inversely proportional to the probability, the buffer size will need to be larger when there\nis less availability for the same weather statistics.\n2.5.4\n\nMultiple Destinations\n\nThere may be buffer sizing improvements as well as timing and schedule improvements, due to\nalternate paths for the signal to travel to multiple destinations. This technique might be used to find a\ndestination whose weather allows for successful communication or even possibly an alternate site in space\nso weather is not an immediate problem. The signal might be sent out on all paths at once or to a path that\nis recognized as available and clear. The probability that multiple destinations have bad weather is smaller\nthan for any single destination. The buffer size is decreased when any one path can be successful at any\ntime and contribute to the whole, consequently stopping the process for the unsuccessful destination. The\nprobabilities and buffer size depend on the exact relationships that lead to successful transmission.\nIf success depends on the entire signal being received, then the buffer size will usually be determined\nby the location with the better weather for the longest period of time and bad weather for the shortest\nperiod of time. The buffer size can then be computed for the location with the smallest \xc2\xb5 so that\n= min(\xc2\xb51 , \xc2\xb5 2 )\n\xc2\xb5\xe2\x80\xb2\n\n(40)\n\nAlternately, if success is determined at each time step, the joint probability for multiple destinations is\nused. A joint probability for two locations may be defined as Pr\xca\xb9[0,1]= probability of clear at either place\ngiven cloudy or rainy at the previous time step at the same place. Separating the two locations and\napplying a logical distributive law, this may be rewritten in a more computable form as Pr\xca\xb9[0,1] =\nprobability of clear at location 1 given cloudy or rainy at the previous time step at location 1 or clear at\nlocation 2 given cloudy or rainy at the previous time step at location 2 (refer to definition 2, for Pr[0,1]).\nUsing the theorem for the joint probability of independent events,\nP(A\xe2\x88\xaa B)= P(A) + P(B) \xe2\x88\x92 P(A\xe2\x88\xa9 B)\n\n(41)\n\nwhere P(A\xe2\x88\xaa B) is the probability of the occurrence of either event A or event B at the same time; that is,\nthe union of the two events, and assuming that the weather at the two locations are independent, the\nresulting equation is\n\nPr \xe2\x80\xb2[0,1] = Pr1[0,1] + Pr2 [0,1] \xe2\x88\x92 Pr1[0,1]Pr2 [0,1]\n\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942018-219927\n\n8\n\n(42)\n\nSimilarly,\n\nPr \xe2\x80\xb2[1,1] = Pr1[1,1] + Pr2 [1,1] \xe2\x88\x92 Pr1[1,1]Pr2 [1,1]\n\n(43)\n\nFor example, if there are two destinations, both with Pr[0,1] = 0.5 , then substituting in Equation (42),\nPr \xe2\x80\xb2[0,1] 0.5 + 0.5 \xe2\x80\x93 0.25 = 0.75; that is, the probability of finding a clear location increases from 50 to 75\n=\n\npercent with a proportional decrease in buffer size required. This computation assumed that what\nhappened at each time step was independent of the adjacent time steps; however, that does not have to be\nthe case.\nHowever, if success requires N number of time steps before success or failure can be determined and\na change can occur, the probability of N clear time steps in a row is\n\nPr \xe2\x80\xb2\xe2\x80\xb2[1,0] = Pr[1,1]N \xe2\x88\x921 Pr[1,0]\n\n(44)\n\nand for two destinations, using Equation (41),\nPr \xe2\x80\xb2\xe2\x80\xb2[1,0] = Pr1[1,1]N \xe2\x88\x921 Pr1[1,0] + Pr2 [1,1]N \xe2\x88\x921 Pr2 [1,0] \xe2\x88\x92 Pr1[1,1]N \xe2\x88\x921 Pr1[1,0]Pr2 [1,1]N \xe2\x88\x921 Pr2 [1,0]\n\n(45)\n\n= =\nThen if both locations have the same probabilities; that is, Pr1[1,0] Pr2 [1,0] Pr[1,0] and\nPr1[1,1] Pr2 [1,1] Pr[1,1] , then\n= =\n= 2 Pr[1,1]N \xe2\x88\x921 Pr[1,0] \xe2\x88\x92 Pr[1,1]2 N \xe2\x88\x92 2 Pr[1,0]2\nPr \xe2\x80\xb2\xe2\x80\xb2[1,0]\n\n(46)\n\nand the ratio of Equation (46) divided by Equation (44) is\n\nratio= 2 \xe2\x88\x92 Pr[1,1]N \xe2\x88\x921 Pr[1,0]\n\n(47)\n\nThen if all the probabilities were 0.5, Pr \xe2\x80\xb2\xe2\x80\xb2[1,0] 2(0.5) N \xe2\x88\x92 (0.5) 2 N , which is still much improved over\n=\nN\n(0.5) for the same time period with a single destination.\nTable I shows how quickly the ratio of probabilities approaches 2.0 as the number of time steps\nincluded in the computation increases.\n\nN\n\nTABLE I.\xe2\x80\x94MULTIPLE DESTINATION PROBABILITIES\nOne destination\nTwo destinations\nRatio\n(Eq.
