Throughout history, Langley has maintained a working partnership with the Department of Defense, U.S. industry, universities, and other government agencies to support the defense of the nation with research. During World War II, Langley directed virtually all of its workforce and facilities to research for military aircraft. Following the war, a balanced program of military and civil projects was undertaken. In some instances Langley research from one aircraft program helped solve a problem in another. At the conclusion of some programs, Langley obtained the research models for additional tests to learn more about previously unknown phenomena. The data also proved useful in later developmental programs. Many of the military aircraft in the U.S. inventory as of late 1999 were over 20 years old. Langley activities that contributed to the development of some of these aircraft began over 50 years prior. This publication documents the role, from early concept stages to problem solving for fleet aircraft, that Langley played in the military aircraft fleet of the United States for the 1990's.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 20000115606, "id": "e41a248b88af4dd7ad87f7c2196a9455", "publicationDate": "2000-10-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20000115606.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20000115606/downloads/20000115606.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20000115606/downloads/20000115606.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20000115606/downloads/20000115606.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
