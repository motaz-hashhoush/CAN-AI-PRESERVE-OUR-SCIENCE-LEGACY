While three-dimensional, transient, turbulent, chemically reacting computational fluid dynamics methodology has been demonstrated to capture major side load physics with rigid nozzles, hot-fire tests often show nozzle structure deformation during major side load events, leading to structural damages if structural strengthening measures were not taken. The modeling picture is incomplete without the capability to address the two-way responses between the structure and fluid. The objective of this study is to develop a tightly coupled aeroelastic modeling algorithm by implementing the necessary structural dynamics component into an anchored computational fluid dynamics methodology. The computational fluid dynamics component is based on an unstructured-grid, pressure-based computational fluid dynamics formulation, while the computational structural dynamics component is developed under the framework of modal analysis. Transient aeroelastic nozzle startup analyses at sea level were performed, and the computed transient nozzle fluid-structure interaction physics presented,", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20140011604, "endDate": "2014-06-20T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Inst. of Aeronautics and Astronautics", "location": "Reston, VA, United States"}}, "meetingId": "c6f1b4ca3f49490bb7756e606dcc5ee2", "id": "5ab241fc5f2a47c383ae9d19ccba5128"}], "name": "AIAA Applied Aerodynamics Conference", "location": "Atlanta, GA", "id": "c6f1b4ca3f49490bb7756e606dcc5ee2", "startDate": "2014-06-16T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20140011604, "id": "bdef40f922bd42dd8f0671bd9e36a156", "publicationDate": "2014-06-16T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20140011604.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20140011604/downloads/20140011604.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20140011604/downloads/20140011604.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20140011604/downloads/20140011604.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
