Much of the information regarding the background and establishment of the NSBRI by NASA has been provided in other documentation and will not be repeated in this Strategic Plan. This Strategic Plan is presented in two volumes. Volume I (this volume) begins with an Introduction (Section 2) that provides the Institute's NASA-defined mission and objectives, and the organizational structure adopted to implement these through three Strategic Programs: Countermeasure Research; Education, Training and Outreach; and Cooperative Research and Development. These programs are described in Sections 3 to 5. Each program is presented in a similar way, using four subsections: Goals and Objectives; Current Strategies; Gaps and Modifications; and Resource Requirements. Section 6 provides the administrative infrastructure and total budget required to implement the Strategic Programs and assures that they form a single cohesive plan. This plan will ensure continued success of the Institute for the next five years. Volume II of the Strategic Plan provides an in-depth analysis of the current and future strategic programs of the 12 current NSBRI teams, including their goals, objectives, mutual interactions and schedules.", "title": "Strategic Plan", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-20T23:33:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-09-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20020087589, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20020087589, "id": "cd7bba0965ff41d48f03d7b74d01ef48", "publicationName": "National Space Biomedical Research Institute", "publicationDate": "2002-09-30T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 20020087588, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "National Space Biomedical Research Institute", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
