It is powered with the Pratt and.\nWhitney "Wasp 11 radial air-cooled engine.\nThere are two compartments for mail: one just aft of the\nengine section, and the other just forward of the pilot. The\nfront compartment has a capacity of 25 cubic feet, the rear one\nof 36 cuhicfeet. The passenger compartment with the seat removed, has a capacity of 34 cubic feet, in case it is desired.\nto use this for additional cargo space. Both mail compartments\nare metal-lined and are provided with hinged metal covers secured by large straps. The passenger cabin has a fixed metal\nceiling.\nThe passenger compartment provides space for two passengers. There is a door in each side, the doors being provided.\nwith sliding safety glass windows. The cabin is furnished with\ncomfortable, leather cushions. Provision is made for forced\nventilation and heating of the passenger compartment.\nThe easoline supply of 100 gallons is carried. in two tanks:\none of 60 g.11ons capacity in the body just aft of the front\n*prepared by the Boeing Airplane Company.\n\nN.A.C.A. Aircraft Circular No. 52 \t\n\n2\n\nmail compartment, and one of 40 gallons in the upper wing. In\nthe event of the failure of the engine pump, the gasoline fecds\nby gravity from the wing tank, and the pilot is provided with a\nhand pump with which he can pump from the main tank to the wing\ntank.\nThe engine is equipped with an electric inertia starter.\nThis starter is ooerated from the pilot\'s cockpit. An enginedriven generator and storage battery (the latter located just\nbehind the f1rewll in the front mail compartment) provide the\nelectric current for starting and lighting. Complete night fly-ing equipment is provided, including a dome light in the passenger comp artment. A pressure fire extinguishei, covering both\nengine and gas tank compartments, is controlled by the pilot.\nHand fire extinguishers are provided in the passenger\'s cabin\nand pilot\'s cockpit.\nThe general characteristics o\xc2\xb1 the airplane are as follows:\nWeight, with 100 gallons gas\nand 1600 lb. payload ........5700 lb.\nWing area ................545 sq.ft.\npan ...................44 ft. 2-1/4 in.\nLength (overall) ............33 ft. 3-3/16 in.\nHeight ..................11 ft. 7-1/2 in.\nChord of wings .............6 ft. 7 in.\nEngine, Pratt & Whitney "Wasp 410 HP., at 1900 R.P.M.\nPropeller, "Hamilton" - forged duralurnin blades, adjustable\non ground, diameter 10 ft.\n\nN.A.C.A.

S. Department of Commerce.\nThe wings are of the simplest wood and wire construction,\nthe spars being of solid spruce, routed for lightness wherever\npossible. The external bracing is streamline duralumin struts\nand streamline wire. The wings are covered with fabric.\nThe body is of steel tubing with welded joints, with steel\ntie rods for diagonal bracing.\nThe rudder, fin and elevator are of steel tubing with welded\n\' joints. The stabilizer is of simple wood construction. All are\nfabric covered; The stabilizer, braced with streamline steel\nstruts and. streamline wire, is adjustable in the air from the\npilot\'s cockpit. The fin may be adjusted on the ground.\n\nN.A.C.A. Aircraft Circular No, 52\n\n\t\n\n4\n\nThe split axle ty-e of landing gear is of streamline steel\ntubing. The shock absorbing device is the well known Boeing\noleo unit. The shock absorber is the familiar rubber cord.\nThe 36 X 8 wheels are provided with brakes, mechanically controlled. by hand from the pilot\'s cockpit. The brakes may be\ncontrolled individually (for steering on the ground) or together\nfor braking in a straight run. The tail skid swivels and can be\nmade steerable.\n\nN.A.0 A.
