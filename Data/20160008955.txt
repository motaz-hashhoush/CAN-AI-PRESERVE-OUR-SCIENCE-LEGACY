The startup\ntransient represents one of the most complex phenomena in the loop heat pipe operation.\nThis paper discusses various aspects of loop heat pipe startup behaviors. Topics include the\nfour startup scenarios, the initial fluid distribution between the evaporator and reservoir\nthat determines the startup scenario, factors that affect the fluid distribution between the\nevaporator and reservoir, difficulties encountered during the low power startup, and\nmethods to enhance the startup success. Also addressed are the pressure spike and pressure\nsurge during the startup transient, and repeated cycles of loop startup and shutdown under\ncertain conditions.\n\nI. Introduction\n\nA\n\nloop heat pipe (LHP) is a very versatile heat transfer device which can transport a large heat load over a long\ndistance with a small temperature difference [1-3]. It utilizes boiling and condensation of the working fluid to\ntransfer heat, and the surface tension forces of menisci formed at the liquid/vapor interfaces on the porous wick to\nsustain the pressure drop induced by the fluid flow. Over the past two decades, significant advances have been made\nin the LHP technology through extensive development efforts. As a result, LHPs have been used for instrument\nthermal control on many orbiting spacecraft [4-8]. Several future flight missions currently under development will\nalso have LHPs onboard.\nAs shown in Figure 1, a typical LHP consists\nPrimary\nSecondary\nEvaporator Vapor\nPump Core Vapor\nWick\nWick\nChannel\nChannel\nof an evaporator with an integral reservoir (also\nknown as compensation chamber), a condenser, a\nvapor line and a liquid line. The evaporator\ncontains a primary wick which sustains the\npressure drop induced by the fluid flow around the\nReservoir\nEvaporator\nloop, and a secondary wick which connects the\nBayonet\nevaporator to the reservoir. The rest of the loop is\nmade of smooth tubes.\nVapor Transport\nLiquid Transport\nLine\nLine\nDetailed descriptions of the operating\nprinciples of an LHP can be found in the literature\n[2, 9]. An LHP must start successfully before it\ncan commence its service. The startup of the LHP\nCondenser\nis a complex transient phenomenon, and is a\nfunction of the loop initial conditions prior to\nFigure1. Schematic of a Typical LHP\nstartup and the heat flux applied to the evaporator.\nExperimental tests also show that, in some cases, the way an LHP starts also affects its subsequent operations. This\npaper focuses on the issues related to the startup of a single-evaporator LHP servicing a heat source all by itself. The\nstartup of multiple single-evaporator LHPs servicing the same heat source [7] are more complex and will not be\ncovered here. Topics to be discussed include the four startup scenarios, initial fluid distribution between the\nevaporator and reservoir that determines the startup scenario, factors that affect the fluid distribution between the\nevaporator and reservoir, difficulties encountered during the low power startup, and methods to enhance the startup\nsuccess. Also discussed are pressure spike and pressure surge, and repeated cycles of loop startup and shutdown.\nNote that the terms reservoir and compensation chamber (CC) will be used interchangeably in this paper.\n\n1\n\nLead Aerospace Engineer, Thermal Engineering Branch, Code 545, Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, MD.\n\nII. LHP Startup Scenarios\nThe initial liquid/vapor distribution in the evaporator core (the space enclosed within the inner diameter of\nthe primary wick) and in the vapor grooves on the outer surface of the primary wick has a great impact on the LHP\nstartup transient behavior. If the evaporator core is filled with liquid, the heat leak from the evaporator to the\nreservoir is small. If the evaporator core contains vapor, the heat leak is large due to the heat pipe effect. If vapor is\npresent in the vapor grooves, liquid will evaporate when a heat load is applied to the evaporator. If the grooves are\ncompletely filled with liquid, however, liquid will not evaporate immediately. Instead, nucleate boiling will take\nplace and a certain amount of liquid superheat is required in order to initiate nucleate boiling.\n\n2.1 Temperature Overshoot and Undershoot during Startup\n\nFinal Tcc\nFinal Tcc\n\nInitial Tcc\n\nInitial Tcc\n\nTemperature\nOvershoot\n\nInitial Tcc\nNo Temperature\nOvershoot\n\nInitial Tcc\n\nFinal Tcc\n\nFinal Tcc\n\nTamb\nTe\nTcc\n\nStart-up\n\nTemperature\n\nFigure 2.

Also shown in\nFigure 3 are the temperature profiles of the reservoir\nand the evaporator from the moment power is\napplied to the evaporator [2]. It is assumed that, in\nall situations, the entire loop is initially at the\nambient temperature except for the condenser,\nwhich is colder than the other parts.\nIn situation 1, the vapor grooves contain vapor\nand the evaporator core is completely filled with\nliquid. This leads to the most benign case where the\nloop will start immediately after the heat load is\napplied to the evaporator. Because of the heat leak\nfrom the evaporator to the reservoir is small, the\ntemperature overshoot for the reservoir and\n\nTemperature\n\n2.2\n\nNo Temperature\nOvershoot\n\nTemperature\nOvershoot\n\nTemperature\n\nDuring the loop startup, the reservoir temperature will\nchange from its initial value to a final steady state value.\nThe transition of the reservoir temperature during the\nstartup transient can be smooth, i.e. the reservoir\ntemperature gradually changes from its initial value to its\nfinal natural operating temperature. In many startups,\nhowever, an overshoot or undershoot of the reservoir\ntemperature can occur. The temperature overshoot is\ndefined as the difference between the maximum transient\ntemperature and the initial or final temperature as shown in\nFigure 2. Likewise, the temperature undershoot is defined\nas the difference between the minimum transient\ntemperature and the initial or final temperature. Even when\nthe reservoir temperature is controlled during the startup\ntransient, a temperature overshoot or undershoot can still\noccur because the reservoir is unable to adjust its\ntemperature instantaneously due to limited control heater\npower.\nMany spacecraft require the heat source to be\nmaintained within a narrow temperature range [1011]. The issue with the temperature overshoot or\nundershoot is that it may cause the instrument\ntemperature to be outside of its allowable\ntemperature range. More details of the temperature\novershoot during startup will be discussed in the\nnext section while the temperature undershoot will\nbe elaborated on later.\n\nTamb\nTe\nTcc\n\nT cc\n\nStart-up\nTime\n\nTime\n\n(b) Situation 2\n\n(d) Situation 4\n\nFigure 3. LHP Startup Scenarios\n\n2\nInternational Conference on Environmental Systems\n\nTemperature\n\nevaporator will be very small, if any, during the startup transient. After the cold liquid from the condenser reaches\nthe reservoir, the reservoir temperature will decrease and the loop will eventually reach a steady state.\nIn situation 2, both the evaporator core and vapor grooves contains vapor. The loop will also start as soon as the\nheat load is applied to the evaporator. However, because of the high heat leak, both the reservoir and the evaporator\nwill experience a large temperature overshoot during the transient before cold liquid from the condenser returns to\nthe reservoir. The transient period and the extent of the temperature overshoot depend on the heat load and the initial\ntemperature of the liquid line and the heat exchange between the liquid line and its surroundings. A low heat load\nwill have a long transient period and a large temperature overshoot because of the parasitic heat gain from the\nenvironment along the liquid line. The parasitic heat gains decreases as the evaporator heat load increases.\nIn situation 3, both the evaporator core and vapor grooves are flooded with liquid. The liquid in vapor grooves\nmust be superheated in order to initiate nucleate boiling and generate first bubbles. Because the heat leak is small,\nthe reservoir temperature will change little. The required superheat can eventually be achieved even with a low heat\nload. Once vapor is present in vapor grooves, the liquid will begin the evaporation process and no superheat is\nneeded. Immediately after boiling, the evaporator temperature\ndrops sharply and the reservoir temperature begins to control\nthe loop operating temperature. The loop will eventually reach a\nsteady state.\n\xef\x81\x84T\nCC\nIn situation 4, vapor grooves are filled with liquid and the\nevaporator core contains vapor. When a heat load is applied to\nEvap\nthe evaporator, the heat leak is large and the reservoir\ntemperature will rise in tandem with the evaporator temperature\nLoop does not start\nas illustrated in Figure 4. If the evaporator temperature can rise\nfaster than the reservoir temperature, the required superheat will\nbe reached to initiate nucleate boiling. Otherwise, nucleate\nTime\nboiling will not occur and the loop will not start successfully.\nFigure 4. Unsuccessful Startup under Situation 4\n2.3 Startup Success\n\n3\nInternational Conference on Environmental Systems\n\nCondenser 1\n\nCondenser 3\n\nLiquid Line\n\nThe beginning of liquid evaporation or nucleate boiling in vapor grooves is characterized by a rise of the\nvapor line temperature to near the reservoir saturation temperature and a drop of the liquid line temperature. When\ntemperatures of the reservoir, evaporator, vapor line and liquid line are plotted against time, it can be inferred from\nthe test data what situation the startup is under. All four startup scenarios have been reported in the literature.\nA successful startup is characterized by the following loop behaviors: 1) the vapor line temperature is the same\nas or close to the reservoir temperature; 2) the evaporator temperature is higher than the reservoir temperature by an\namount determined by the heat load and the evaporator thermal conductance; 3) the liquid line temperature is lower\nthan the reservoir temperature; and 4) temperatures of the reservoir, evaporator, vapor line and liquid line approach\ntheir respective steady state temperatures asymptotically.\n9\n10\n11\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\nExperimental results from ground testing of several\n6\n7\n8\nLHPs are presented in the next section for illustration\nEvaporator\npurposes. These LHPs are designated as LHP-A, LHP-B,\n12\n36\nReservoir\n6,7,8\n9,10,11\n35\nand LHP-C, and are ordinary single-evaporator LHPs.\n13\n34\n15\nOnly schematics of these LHPs are presented. Details of\n33\ntheir designs can be found in the referenced papers.\n14\n32\nVapor Line\n16\nUnless otherwise specified, all tests were conducted under\n31\n17\nambient condition in a gravity netural environment using\n30\n18\nammonia as the working fluid.\n19\n29\n2.4\nEffect of Heat Load on Startup Success\n28\n20\n26\n25\n24\n23\n22\n27\n21\nAn LHP can start rather quickly and reliably as\nlong as a large heat load (more precisely, a high heat flux)\nCondenser 2\nis applied even under the worst case scenario of situation\nFigure 5.\nSchematic of LHP-A with\n4. This can be attributed to the quick rise of the evaporator\nThermocouple Locations [14, 15]\ntemperature above the reservoir temperature, and the\ncirculation of a large flow of the working fluid. Under such a condition, there is ample liquid subcooling to balance\nthe heat leak from the evaporator to the reservoir regardless of which startup scenario prevails. Some examples from\ntests conducted on LHP-A as shown in Figure 5 [14, 15] are presented below.\n\n301\n300\nPump\n(TC9)\n\n299\n\nTemperature (C)\n\n298\n297\n296\nReservoir\n(TC5)\n\n295\n294\n\nVapor line\n(TC15)\n\n293\n292\n\nPump liquid\ninlet (TC36)\n\n291\n10:15\n\n10:20\n\n10:25\n\n10:30\n\nTim e (hr)\n\nFigure 6.

Because the reservoir temperature rose with the\nevaporator, and a superheat was needed at the boiling\nincipience, it seemed to indicate a situation 4 startup.\nHowever, this was more likely a situation 3 startup. The\nslow rise of teh reservoir temperatue was most likely due\nto a heat leak from the evaportor. A situation 4 startup\nwould show a much sharper rise of the reservoir\ntemperature in tandem with the evaporator temperature.\nBoiling started in less than 3 minutes after 50 W had been\napplied. All temperatures approach steady state values, and\nthe loop started successfully with such a high power.\nIn most space applications, the evaporator is\nattached to a large thermal mass that is to be cooled.\nDuring the startup transient, the net heat load to the\nevaporator will likely be small. In other words, a low\npower startup prevails under most space applications. The\nstartup with low powers under situations 1, 2, and 3 has not\nshown any problem. Many LHPs can start smoothly with\nvery low powers under situation 1. For example, LHP-A\ndemonstrated successful startups with powers ranging from\n2W to 200W [14]. A large temperature overshoot may\noccur under situation 2, and it may take a long time for\nnucleate boiling to occur under situation 3. For low power\nstartup under situation 4, there are several possible\noutcomes: 1) a smooth and successful startup; 2) a\nsuccessful startup with a very large temperature overshoot;\n3) an unsuccessful startup that yields an excursion of the\nevaporator and reservoir temperatures with no forward\nflow being established; 4) a reverse flow that is eventually\novercome by a forward flow, leading to a successful\nstartup; and 5) a sustaining reverse flow and thus an\nunsuccessful startup.\nFigure 7 illustrates a successful startup of LHP-A\nwith 5W. The heat load was applied at 9:33. This is clearly\na situation 4 startup. Because of the high heat leak, the\nreservoir temperature followed the evaporator\ntemperature closely, requiring the evaporator temperature\nto rise even higher. The high heat leak also left less power\nto heat the evaporator. Consequently, it took 45 minutes\nto initiate nucleate boiling, compared to 3 minutes when\nthe heat load was 50W shown in Figure 6.\nThe evaporator temperature shown in Figure 7\nreached a peak value of 301K with a temperature\novershoot of less than 4K, which was not unusual. When\nthe same LHP was tested in a thermal vacuum chamber\nand the evaporator/reservoir was raised 690 mm above\nthe condenser, the evaporator temperature rose more than\n35 degrees before nucleate boiling occurred with 10W\nheat load as shown in Figure 8. The loop finally reached a\nsteady state with a temperature overshoot of 20 degrees.\nIn real applications, the evaporator peak temperature\nduring this startup was most likely higher than that\n\nVapor Line\n\n10\n283\n\n40\n\n273\n0\n\nLiquid Line\n\n263\n-10\n\n15:00\n\n16:00\n\n17:00\n\n18:00\n\n19:00\n\n20\n0\n20:00\n\nTime(Hours)\n\nFigure 2.9 \xe2\x80\x93 NRL Nickel Wick LHP Start-Up\n\nFigure 8.

Under such a circumstance, the startup process shown in Figure 8 would have been\ndiscontinued and an unsuccessful startup declared before nucleate boiling was initiated.\n\n2.5\n\nFlow Reversal\n\nAnother phenomenon associated with low power startup under situation 4 is a flow reversal. When the\nevaporator core contains vapor, liquid evaporation can occur inside the evaporator core with no superheat required\nwhile liquid in vapor grooves is being heated to achieve the required superheat for nucleate boiling. The heat source\nfor liquid evaporation comes from the heat leak that is transmitted through the primary wick. The heat leak raises the\nreservoir temperature and pressure, which move the fluid to the condenser where the pressure is lower. The fluid\nwill take the path of least resistance, which is via the liquid line because the menisci at the inner surface of the\nprimary wick prevent vapor from penetrating the wick. The reverse flow will continue until nucleate boiling occurs\nin vapor grooves on the outer surface of the primary wick. Once a forward flow is established, it is easier for the\nvapor to be generated on the outer surface than the inner surface of the primary wick. Thus, the forward flow\nprevails from then on.\nA reverse flow can happen at any heat\n15\nload. With high heat loads, the forward\n27\n11\n16 26 28\nflow is established so quickly that the\n8\nreverse flow only lasts for seconds or less.\n10\n14\n17 25 29\nAt low heat loads, however, the reverse\n7\nflow may last for an extended period. The\nEVAPORATOR\n9\nlow power startup shown in Figure 7\n18 24 30\n6\nVAPOR LINE\n13\n12\nindicated a flow reversal as evidenced by\n5\nthe rise of the liquid line temperature with\n19 23 31\nthe reservoir temperature and a slight\nCONDENSER\n4\n2\nDP\n3\ndecrease of the vapor line temperature.\nCOMPENSATION\n20 22 32\n37\nThe forward flow was established after\nCHAMBER\n21\n1\nLIQUID LINE\n35\n36\nnucleate boiling had occurred.\n33\nFlow reversal was also observed\n34\nAP\nduring the low power tests of LHP-B\nshown in Figure 10 [15, 16], which was a\nFigure 9. Schematic of LHP-B with Thermocouple Locations [15, 16]\nsituation 4 startup. The flow was reversed\nbecause the liquid line temperatures at TC\nNRL LHP 01/08/2001\n36 and TC 34 rose with the reservoir\n40000\n312\ntemperature and the vapor line\n01/08/2001\n310\ntemperature decreased and then remained\n35000\nsubcooled. The reverse flow lasted for 4\n308\nEvap (7)\n30000\nhours without any sign of transition to a\n306\n25000\nforward flow. Only when the power was\n304\nincreased to 100W was a forward flow\nLiq Line (34)\n20000\nestablished. The large mass flow rate at\n302\n15000\n100W brought ample subcooling to the\n300\nCC (3)\nreservoir, and helped collapse vapor\n10000\n298\nbubbles inside the evaporator core. After\n5000\nCC Inlet (36)\na steady temperature of 299K was\n296\nDP\nreached at 100W, the heat load was\n0\n294\nVap Line (15)\nreduced to 5W. The forward flow\n5W\n100 W\n5W\n292\n-5000\ncontinued and the loop reached a new\n8:30\n9:30\n10:30\n11:30\n12:30\n13:30\n14:30\n15:30\nsteady temperature of 296K. Note that\nTime (hours)\nthe loop operating temperature was lower\nFigure 10. Flow Reversal during Startup of LHP-B with 5W\nat 5W than at 100W because the sink\ntemperature was near the ambient\ntemperature and the condenser was fully utilized under both heat loads.\nTC 6,7,8\n\nTC 9,10,11\n\nTC 1,3,5\n\nPressure Drop (Pa)\n\nTC 4\n\nTemperature (K)\n\nTC2\n\n2.6 Temperature Control Methods and Startup Success\nSeveral methods have been developed to control the reservoir temperature at its desired set point [10, 11]. The\nmost common method to control the reservoir temperature is to cold bias the reservoir and use an electrical heater to\n5\nInternational Conference on Environmental Systems\n\ncompensate for subcooling. This method has been proven to be effective, but it also has its shortcomings. First, the\nelectrical heater can only provide heating to the reservoir, i.e. the set point temperature can be maintained only for\ncertain range of evaporator heat load. Second, the required CC control heater power can be very large when the\ncondenser sink is very cold. Several methods have been used to reduce the control heater power requirement [1722]. The method of using a coupling block between the vapor line and liquid line is effective in reducing the liquid\nsubcooling and control heater power [6, 17]. On the other hand, this method is purely passive. At low powers, the\nliquid subcooling is small and the heat leak dominates.During the startup, the heat load is small, resulting in a high\nheat leak relative to the liquid subcooling. Thus, cooling instead of heating is needed for the reservoir during the\nstartup, but the coupling block will heat the liquid line at all times. In essence, it raises the natural operating\ntemperature of the loop at low powers. Since startup is basically a low power operation, using this method will\nincrease the temperature overshoot during startup. When the temperature overshoot is too high, the loop may not\nstart successfully before the maximum allowable temperature is reached [17]. When the LHP is tested at an adverse\nelection, such an effect becomes even more pronounced as illustrated in Figure 8. Other active or semi-active\nenhancement methods for reservoir temperature control can avoid or mitigate such a problem [7, 10-11, 20-22].\n\nIII. Factors Affecting Fluid Distribution in Evaporator and Reservoir\nThe heat leak is strongly dependent upon the vapor void fraction inside the evaporator core. Furthermore,\nthe higher the vapor void fraction, the higher the heat leak [13, 16]. It has been demonstrated over and over again in\nground tests of many LHPs that the heat leak from the evaporator to reservoir is the single most important factor in\ndetermining the LHP behavior in all aspects of its low power operation. For a given LHP, the vapor void fraction\ninside the evaporator core is affected by combinations of several factors, including the evaporator/reservoir\nassembly design, fluid inventory, pre-conditioning of the loop, body forces, tilt between the evaporator and\nreservoir, and elevation between the evaporator/reservoir and condenser. The following examples illustrate the effect\nof various combinations of these variables on the LHP startup and its subsequent operations.\n\n3.1 Evaporator Assembly Design and Gravity\nThere is a minimum volume requirement for\nVapor\nthe reservoir in order for the loop to operate\nLiquid\nproperly [2]. In addition, the fluid inventory must\nGravity\nfrom\nbe sufficient to accommodate the loop operation\nCondenser\nLiquid\nunder all anticipated thermal conditions in space.\nEvaporator\nAlthough in theory there is no upper limit on the\nFigure 11. Liquid in the Reservoir in Concentric Evaporator\nreservoir volume, the reservoir size is optimized\nAssembly in a Gravity Field\nto accommodate the available real estate and to\nreduce the overall LHP volume and mass. The\noptimized reservoir design may have the same or\nVapor\na different diameter as the evaporator. Because\nthe reservoir and evaporator form an integrated\nLiquid\nLiquid\nGravity\nassembly, the assembly design and the amount of\nfrom\nfluid inventory play an important role in the fluid\nCondenser\nReservoir\nEvaporator\ndistribution between these two components in\nFigure 12. Liquid in the Reservoir in an Eccentric Evaporator\nground testing.\nAssembly in a Gravity Field\nFigure 1 shows the fluid distribution in\nthe evaporator and reservoir under the zero-G\ncondition. A liquid puddle will stay on one end of the reservoir where the temperature is slightly lower due to the\ncold incoming subcooled liquid in the bayonet tube and the structure of vanes and wicks inside the reservoir. In\nground tests, the liquid puddle will stay at the bottom of the reservoir instead. Unless the liquid in the reservoir rises\nto a level that covers the evaporator core, the evaporator core will contain vapor and the startup will be affected. The\nsituation becomes worse when the reservoir has a larger diameter than the evaporator, as shown in Figure 11. The\nevaporator core could be mostly filled with vapor due to liquid drainage in the reservoir.\nOne method to mitigate the liquid drainage issue is to design an eccentric evaporator/reservoir assembly so that\nthe reservoir and evaporator are on the same level in a gravity field as shown in Figure 12. In this design, the gravity\nwill force liquid to fill the evaporator core. Such an eccentric design is especially useful for spacecraft level ground\ntesting when the orientation of the LHP on the spacecraft is known in advance.\n6\nInternational Conference on Environmental Systems\n\n3.2 Fluid Inventory and Tilt in Ground Tests\nCC ID = 25mm\nWick OD = 24.2 mm\nWick ID\n7.62 mm\n\n.\n\n12.5 mm\n\n8.69 mm\n\n18.3 mm\n12.4 mm\n7.75 mm\n100 grams\n49.5% filled\nH/D = 0.496\n\n83 grams\n32.1% filled\nH/D = 0.312\n\n113 grams\n71.8% filled\nH/D = 0.73\n\nFigure\n13.\nCross-Sectional\nView\nof\nEvaporator/Reservoir with Various Fluid Inventories\n\nLHP-B\n\nNRL LHP 01/18/2001\n\n315\n310\n\n01/18/01\n\n305\nEvap (7)\n300\n\nTemperature (K)\n\nExtensive experimental investigations of\nthe start-up of LHP-B were conducted with\nvarious combinations of fluid inventory, tilt,\ncondenser sink temperature, and heat load [12 16]. Figure 13 shows the cross sectional view of\nthe reservoir and evaporator for three fluid\ninventories (83 grams, 100 grams, and 113\ngrams) and three tilts from evaporator end to the\nreservoir end (+6.35mm, 0 mm, and -6.35mm).\nThe evaporator and reservoir have the same\ndiameter. Test results show that the loop could\nstart with 100W or 200W regardless of the fluid\ninventory, tilt, or condenser sink temperature. For\nheat loads less than 100W, start-up was highly\ndependent upon the fluid inventory and the tilt.\nWith a fluid inventory of 83 grams, the loop\ncould not start successfully below 25W in all\nthree tilts. In contrast, the loop could start\nsuccessfully with heat loads as low as 5W in all\ntilts with fluid inventories of 100 grams and 113\ngrams.\nIt can be seen from Figure 13 that even a\nslight tilt of the evaporator assembly has a big\nimpact on the vapor void fraction in the\nevaporator core with 83 grams of inventory. In\nparticular, when the evaporator end was raised\n+6.35 mm above the reservoir, one of the start-up\ntests led to a flow reversal with a heat load as\nhigh as 50W. Figure 14 shows the flow reversal\nlasted for about 15 minutes and the evaporator\ntemperature rose by 20 degrees before nucleate\nboiling finally occurred and the forward flow was\nestablished. Such a long duration of flow reversal\nduring the start-up with 50W was very unusual.\nApparently, the heat leak was very large during\nthe start-up transient under this test condition.\n\nVap Line (15)\n\n295\nCC (3)\n\n290\n\nCC Inlet (36)\n285\nLiq Line (34)\n\n280\n275\n\nLiq Line (33)\n270\n265\n7:30\n\n0W\n\n50 WATTS\n8:00\n\n8:30\n\n9:00\n\n9:30\n\n10:00\n\nTime (hours)\n\nFigure 14. Flow Reversal during Startup Test of LHP-B with\n50W\n\nIV. Enhancing Startup Success\nUnder situation 3 and situation 4, liquid in vapor grooves must overcome the superheat required for\nnucleate boiling in order for the LHP to start successfully. For low power startups, the reservoir temperature may\nrise in tandem with the evaporator temperature under situation 4 as shown in Figure 4 and the required superheat\nmay never be achieved. Because of the large thermal mass attached to the evaporator, most startups of LHPs for\nspace applications will be low power startups. Although the loop should start successfully under situation 3 even\nwith low powers, the time required to initiate nucleate boiling could be unacceptably long. Furthermore, some\nsensitive instruments require that the LHP be operational before they can be turned on, and still some instruments\nrequire the loop to start within a specified period of time. Two methods of enhancing the startup success are\ndescribed below.\n\n4.1 Startup Heater\nWhen the first vapor bubble is generated in the vapor grooves, the bubble will quickly grow to occupy the entire\nlength of the evaporator. Once vapor is present in the vapor grooves, liquid will go through the evaporation process\nwhich requires no superheat. Therefore, the key to starting the loop under situations 3 and 4 is to generate the first\nbubble or bubbles as soon as possible. A concentrated heat source over a localized area will achieve this goal. By\nattaching a small heater on the evaporator surface, a high heat flux will quickly raise the temperature of liquid in the\n7\nInternational Conference on Environmental Systems\n\nvicinity of the heater while minimizing the heat leak to the reservoir. Thus, the reservoir temperature and the local\nevaporator temperature shown in Figure 4 will diverge rapidly to reach the required superheat. As soon the first\nbubble is generated, the loop will start. This is the essence of using a startup heater.\nThe startup heater has proven to be very effective in enhancing the startup success, and many LHPs in flight\napplications employ such a device because of its simplicity in design and ease in implementation [5-8].\n4.2 Thermoelectric Converter\nQTEC, H\n\nQTEC, L\n\nTTEC, H\n\nTTEC, L\nTEC\n\nQTEC, App\n\nTEC\n\nThermal Strap\n\nQTEC, L\nQsub\n\nQTEC, App\n\nThermal Strap\n\nQTEC, H\nQsub\n\nQleak\n\nQleak\n\nEvap, TE\n\nCC, Tset\n\nEvap, TE\n\nCC, Tset\n\nFigure 16.

The advantage of using a TEC is that it can\nprovide both heating and cooling to the reservoir by changing the polarity of the voltage of the power supply.\nFigure 15 and Figure 16 show the heat flow when the TEC is cooling and heating the reservoir, respectively. During\nthe startup, if the heat leak raises the reservoir temperature above its set point, the TEC will absorb the heat and\nmaintain the reservoir set point. With a constant reservoir temperature, the evaporator can eventually achieve the\nrequired superheat to initiate nucleate boiling and ensure startup success. This is illustrated in Figure 17.\n\n\xef\x81\x84T\n\nEvap\n\nEvap\n\xef\x81\x84T\nCC\n\nLoop starts\n\nLoop starts\n\nTime\n\nTime\n\nFigure 17.

When the TEC is cooling the\nreservoir, the absorbed heat along with the\nTEC power is delivered to the evaporator,\nwhich increases the power for startup.\nWhen the TEC is heating the reservoir for\ntemperature control, part of the heat comes\nfrom the heat applied to the evaporator,\nand the required reservoir control heater\npower is substantially reduced.\nFigure 19 shows the schematic of\nLHP-C, which is a miniature LHP [22, 2425], and Figure 20 illustrates the TEC that\nwas installed on the reservoir and\n\nFigure 18.

Extensive tests were performed in\nthe laboratory, and the effectiveness of\nusing a TEC for LHP temperature control\nand startup has been demonstrated. Startup\ntests were 100 percent successful, and the\ncontrol heater power for reservoir\ntemperature control was 40 to 60 percent\nless than that of using an electrical heater.\nFigure 21 shows the startup of\nLHP-C using a TEC for reservoir set point\ntemperature control. The evaporator and\nreservoir were at 299K initially. As a heat\nload of 10W was applied to the evaporator\nfor startup, the reservoir was set to 303K\nusing the TEC. The reservoir temperature\nrose to 303K and stayed nearly constant\neven when the evaporator temperature\nrose above the reservoir temperature\nbecause the heat leak was removed from\nthe reservoir by the TEC. When the\nevaporator temperature overcame the\nrequired superheat, the loop started\nsuccessfully. This is the startup\nmechanism illustrated in Figure 17. For\ncomparison, a similar startup using an\nelectrical heater to maintain the reservoir\nset point is shown in Figure 22. When the\nevaporator temperature exceeded the\nreservoir temperature, the reservoir also\nrose in temperature along with the\nevaporator because of the heat leak and\nbecause of the inability of the heater to\ncool the reservoir. Although the loop also\nstarted successfully, the temperature\novershoot was much higher.\nTECs were also installed on a\nbreadboard and proto-flight units of an\nLHP with two evaporators and two\ncondensers [26-29]. Again, all startup\ntests were 100 percent successful. In\nparticular,\nthe\nproto-flight\nunit\ndemonstrated\nsuccessful\nstartup\nrepeatedly by lowering the reservoir\ntemperature below the evaporator\ntemperature without applying power to\nthe evaporators in thermal vacuum tests.\nFigure 23 shows the temperatures in one\nof the startup tests. For clarity, only\ntemperatures of one set of the evaporator,\nreservoir, and thermal mass attached to\nthe evaporator are shown.

The loop was quiescent until the reservoir temperature dropped\nto 277K. The loop started at 8:17 with a superheat of 2K without applying any power to the evaporator. The startup\nand continued operation of the LHP were evidenced by the fact that temperatures of the evaporators, transport lines,\nand thermal masses all moved in tandem with the change of the CC temperatures. The heat input to the evaporators\ncame from the power that was applied to the TECs,\nand the heat that was pumped out of the reservoirs.\nStart-up Test August 12, 2009\nOnce the loop was running, an additional heat\n60\n280\nsource came from the release of the sensible heat by\n278\nthe thermal masses. This is the startup mechanism\n50\nMass\nillustrated in Figure 18.\n276\n40\nThe TEC is very versatile and effective, but it\n274\nVapor Line\nalso adds complexity in the design of the thermal\n30\nsubsystem. In order for the TEC to provide both\n272\nheating and cooling to the reservoir, a bipolar power\nEvaporator\n20\nsupply is needed, which adds weight to the system\n270\nLiquid Line\nand requires control algorithms.

OtherStartup Issues\n5.1 Pressure Spike and Pressure Surge\nUnder situation 3 and situation 4, the liquid in the vapor grooves must overcome the superheat requirement for\nnucleate boiling. The required superheat can vary from a fraction of one degree to more than ten degrees.\nImmediately following the inception of nucleate boiling, the vapor bubble will absorb the sensible heat stored in the\nsuperheated liquid and grow rapidly. In fact, the growth of the vapor bubble is similar to an explosion. Tests have\nbeen conducted with a differential pressure transducer installed to measure the pressure drop across the evaporator.\nExperimental data shows that the pressure differential can be as high as 45 kPa. The actual pressure drop across the\nmenisci at the outer surface of the primary wick could be even higher. Such a high pressure drop may exceed the\ncapillary limit of the primary wick and cause the vapor to penetrate the wick to reach the evaporator core. However,\nthe high pressure drop only lasted for less than one second. In fact, measuring the pressure spike was a hit or miss\nendeavor when the data was scanned once per second or less often. Such a pressure spike could be detected with\ncertainty only if the data scan rate was set to 10 scans or 100 scans per second. Because of the short duration of the\npressure spike and the ability of the LHP to tolerate a vapor bubble in the evaporator core, no LHP deprime due to\nthe pressure spike has been observed.\nImmediately following the boiling incipience, liquid in the vapor line will be swept into the condenser. An equal\nvolume of the liquid will be moved toward the reservoir at the same volumetric flow rate as the vapor is being\ngenerated in the vapor grooves. In other words, the liquid is being swept out of the vapor line at the same speed as\nthe vapor is flowing there. Depending on the ratio of the vapor specific volume to the liquid specific volume, the\nvolumetric flow rate of the liquid along the condenser and liquid line can be two orders of magnitude higher than its\nsteady state value at the same heat load during the normal operation of the LHP. Such a high flow rate will induce a\nsurge of the pressure drop that is imposed on the primary wick until vapor reaches the condenser. The magnitude\nand duration of the pressure surge depend on the working fluid, the saturation temperature, the heat load, the volume\nof the vapor line and vapor grooves, and the initial vapor line temperature. For most fluids, the ratio of the vapor to\nliquid specific volumes increases rapidly with a decreasing temperature whereas the latent heat increase modestly\nwith a decreasing temperature. Thus, the pressure surge will be more severe at a low reservoir temperature. Unlike a\ncapillary pumped loop, an LHP has a much higher pumping capability and can usually sustain the pressure surge\nwithout any problem.\n\n10\nInternational Conference on Environmental Systems\n\n5.2 Reservoir Temperature Undershoot\nWhen a slug of cold liquid is injected into the reservoir, the reservoir temperature will decrease if its temperature\nis not regulated by a heater. When a large amount of cold liquid enters the reservoir rapidly, the reservoir\ntemperature will drop suddenly and sharply. Nevertheless, the evaporator can usually adjust its temperature swiftly\nto maintain its thermodynamic equilibrium with the reservoir regardless of whether a large thermal mass is attached\nor not. When the evaporator temperature drops along with the reservoir, the thermal mass simply releases its\nsensible heat to the evaporator. However, it is possible for the reservoir temperature to drop below the minimum\nallowable temperature set by the instrument or the spacecraft. Furthermore, in an unlikely scenario when the\nreservoir temperature drops more quickly than the evaporator can adapt, the pressure differential between the\nevaporator and the reservoir can exceed the wick capillary limit, leading to a loop deprime.\nEven if an electrical heater or a TEC is used to regulate the reservoir temperature, a severe temperature\nundershoot can still occur when a large amount of cold liquid enters the reservoir suddenly because the heater power\nis not unlimited and the reservoir temperature cannot be raised so quickly. Thus, a violation of the minimum\nallowable temperature may still happen when the reservoir temperature is being regulated.\nA large reservoir temperature undershoot can happen at any time during the LHP operation as a result of a\nsudden influx of a large amount of very cold liquid into the reservoir. This has been observed in ground testing of an\nLHP with a large condenser that was placed in a vertical position. However, a large reservoir temperature\nundershoot is most frequently seen during the startup of a fully flooded loop for reasons described in the previous\nsection. Although the drop of the reservoir temperature itself is not an issue, its temperature rise when regulated by\nan electrical heater or a TEC could have an undesirable consequence. This is explained in the next section.\n\n5.3 Repeated Cycles of Loop Startup and Shutdown\n\n11\nInternational Conference on Environmental Systems\n\nPower (W)\n\nTemperature (K)\n\nWhen the reservoir is heated, its temperature will rise and so will the corresponding saturation pressure. In order\nfor the evaporator and reservoir to maintain a pressure balance, the evaporator temperature must rise fast enough to\nkeep the corresponding temperature difference. If the rate of temperature increase in the reservoir is greater than that\nof the evaporator, the saturation pressure in the reservoir will eventually exceed the pressure in the evaporator. As a\nresult, the evaporator will be flooded with liquid.\nFollowing the inception of nucleate boiling during the startup, the vapor line is being cleared of liquid. During\nthis period, a severe reservoir temperature undershoot could happen as explained in the previous section. In\nresponse, the reservoir control heater will be turned on. If the heater power is so large that it raises the reservoir\ntemperature faster than the evaporator can follow, the loop will be flooded with liquid again by the time the\nreservoir reaches its set point temperature. The loop is shut down and has to re-start. However, the re-start will\nfollow the same process as the previous startup. In some cases, this leads to perpetual startup and shutdown cycles\nunless some operating parameter is changed. The larger the rate of temperature increase of the reservoir compared to\nthat of the evaporator, and the longer the reservoir is being heated, the higher the possibility of the loop being shut\ndown temporarily.\nFigure 24 shows the repeated startup and\n12/18/2009; 253K sink; 350 g mass; Pre-heating CC; EH set point@313K on the TM - TC33; PID\nshutdown cycles in one of the LHP-C tests.\n330\n140\nThe control temperature sensor was placed on\nEvap (5)\nTM (33)\nthe thermal mass with a set point of 313K, and\n120\n320\nthe electrical heater installed on the reservoir\n100\n310\nwas used to regulate the reservoir temperature\nso as to keep the thermal mass at its set point\n80\nCC (2)\n300\ntemperature of 313K.

The reservoir\n20\nEvap Power\ncontrol heater was turned on. With 4W to the\n270\n0\nreservoir and 10W to the evaporator/mass, the\nEH Power\nreservoir temperature rose much faster than\n-20\n260\n8:30\n8:45\n9:00\n9:15\n9:30\n9:45\n10:00 10:15 10:30 10:45\nthe evaporator/mass could catch up. The entire\nTime (HH:MM)\nloop was again flooded with liquid. This was\nevidenced by the rise of the reservoir\nFigure 24. Repeated Startup and Shutdown Cycles of LHP-C\ntemperature above the evaporator/mass\ntemperature, the rise of the liquid line\n\ntemperature to the reservoir temperature, and the drop of the vapor line temperature below the reservoir temperature.\nWhen the loop started again, it went through the same process over and over again.\nThe key to eliminating repeated startup and shutdown cycles is to prevent the reservoir temperature from rising\nabove the evaporator temperature. There are several ways to accomplish this goal and all methods were successfully\ndemonstrated in other LHP-C tests: 1) placing the temperature sensor on the reservoir - this shortened the delay of\nthe reservoir response to the change of the control temperature sensor; 2) reducing the reservoir heater power \xe2\x80\x93 no\nrepeated startup and shutdown cycles when the reservoir control heater power was 2W or less; 3) increasing the heat\nload to the evaporator/mass. Figure 24 shows successful startup when the heat load to the evaporator/mass was\nincreased to 40W; 4) tightening the control band of the reservoir set point temperature to reduce the duration of\nreservoir heating; and 5) using a TEC instead of electrical heater for reservoir temperature control.\n\nVI. Concluding Remarks\nThe startup of a loop heat pipe can be complex. Although most loop heat pipes aboard orbiting spacecraft have\ndemonstrated successful startups uneventfully, difficulties in loop startup do arise from time to time. This paper\npresents an overview on various aspects of the loop heat pipe startup behaviors. Many examples are presented to\nshow out-of-the-ordinary startup cases and some methods that can be used to alleviate such startup difficulties.\nThe fluid distribution between the evaporator and the reservoir dictates whether nucleate boiling will occur and\nwhether liquid superheat is needed during the startup. In order for the LHP to operate properly, the fluid inventory\nmust be sufficient to flood the entire loop with liquid and still has some liquid left in the reservoir. In space flight,\nthe loop is usually preconditioned so that the entire loop is flooded with liquid. Thus, the loop startup degenerates to\nthe Situation 3 startup. In ground testing, whether or not the loop can be completely flooded with liquid depends on\nthe evaporator and reservoir assembly design, the fluid inventory, the tilt between the evaporator and reservoir, and\nthe elevation between the evaporator and condenser. All four startup situations have been observed in ground\ntesting, and some startup difficulties did occur, especially for low power startups.\nMany spacecraft require the loop heat pipe to be operational prior to turning on their sensitive instruments. To\novercome the superheat requirement for nucleate boiling and to enhance the startup success, a startup heater can be\ninstalled on the evaporator or a thermoelectric converter can be installed on the reservoir with a connection to the\nevaporator via a thermal strap. The startup heater proves to be very effective in improving the startup success.\nBecause of its simplicity in design and ease in implementation, many loop heat pipes onboard spacecraft employ\nstartup heaters. The thermoelectric converter almost guarantees a successful startup while providing both heating\nand cooling to the reservoir for set point temperature control. However, it also adds complexities in loop heat pipe\nassembly design, requires additional power supplies and adds weight. No loop heat pipes with thermoelectric\nconverters have been flown in space so far.\nThe LHP startup represents a fast transient phenomenon that can result in pressure spike and pressure surge due\nto the rapid movement of the fluid. The rapid return of the cold liquid from the condenser to the reservoir can cause\nthe reservoir temperature to drop suddenly, and may lead to perpetual cycles of startup and shutdown of the loop if\nthe reservoir control heater power is too large. One must carefully evaluate the rate of temperature rise of the\nreservoir relative to that of the evaporator, and adjust the reservoir control heater power accordingly during startup.\n\nReferences\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n5.\n6.\n\n7.\n\nMaidanik, Y., and Fershtater, Y., \xe2\x80\x9cTheoretical Basis and Classification of Loop Heat Pipes and Capillary Pumped Loops,\xe2\x80\x9d 10th\nInternational Heat Pipe Conference, Stuttgart, Germany, 1997.\nKu, J., \xe2\x80\x9cOperating Characteristics of Loop Heat Pipes,\xe2\x80\x9d SAE Paper No. 1999-01-2007, 29th International Conference on\nEnvironmental Systems, Denver, Colorado, July 12-15, 1999.\nMaidanik, Y., \xe2\x80\x9cLoop Heat Pipes \xe2\x80\x93 Theory, Experimental developments and Application,\xe2\x80\x9d 13th International Heat Pipe\nConference, Sydney, Australia, August 9-13, 2006.\nMaidanik, Y.
