Marshall scientists have developed a detection concept based on fact that bearing defects themselves excite resonant frequency of rolling elements of bearing as they impact the defect. By detecting resonant frequency and subsequently analyzing character of the signal, bearing defects may be detected and identified as to source. The bearing fault detector will help eliminate this cause of derailments.", "title": "Bearing Failure Detection", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-21T05:59:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-09-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20030005420, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20030005420, "id": "8a314fc037c34219af27c2c1d46dca5b", "publicationName": "Spinoff 1976", "publicationDate": "1976-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20030005420.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20030005420/downloads/20030005420.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20030005420/downloads/20030005420.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20030005420/downloads/20030005420.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
