Common sense dictates that a human departure from Earth measured in years, to explore a distant planet, requires systems, techniques, and operations that have solid credibility proven with space experience. The space test and verification experience must occur with Mars-like conditions but under proving-ground conditions with good instrumentation, close monitoring, and fast emergency recovery capabilities. The lunar environment is the only arena that satisfies the requirements of a space recovery capabilities. The lunar environment is the only arena that satisfies the requirements of a space planetary proving-ground. The objective of this scenario is to demonstrate a program planning approach that has human presence at Mars as the goal but, prudently, capitalizes on manned lunar project facilities, operations, and experience to enable a safe journey for the first Mars crews. The emphasis in lunar application objectives is to perform productive science and resources exploitation missions. Most of the Mars mission aspects can be proven in the lunar environment providing 'stepping stones' to conducting the first human mission to travel to Mars and return safely to Earth.", "title": "Lunar stepping stones to a manned Mars exploration scenario", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T17:44:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19930004828, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Davidson, W.
