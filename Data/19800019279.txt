R. Wang and B. J. Choudhury\nABSTRACT\nA simple method of estimating moisture content W of a bare soil from the observed brightness temperature TB at 1.4GHz is discussed in this paper. The method is based on a radiative\ntransfer model calculation (Wilheit, 1978), which has been successfully used in the past to account for many observational results (Choudhury et al., 1979), with some modifications to take\ninto account the effect of surface roughness. Besides the measured T B\'s, the three additional\ninputs required by the method are the effective soil thermodynamic temperature, the precise relation between W and the smooth field brightness temperature T Bs , and a parameter specifying\nthe surface roughness characteristics. The soil effective temperature can be measured, and the procedures of estimating surface roughness parameter and of obtaining the relation between W and\nT Bs are discussed in detail.\nIt is pointed out that dual polarized radiometric measurements at an off-nadir incident angle\n8 are sufficient to estimate both surface roughness parameter and W, provided that the relation between W and T Bs at the same d is known. Since the relation between W and T Bs is known only at\n6 = B\xc2\xb0 for Adelanto loam, the method of W estimate is demonstrated with two sets of experimental\n\ndata at 9 = 8\xc2\xb0, one from a controlled field experiment by a mobile tower and the other, from aircraft overflight. The results from both data sets are encouraging when the estimated W\'s are compared with the acquired ground truth of W\'s in the top 2cm layer. An offset between the estimated\nand the measured W\'s exists in the results of the analyses, but that can be accounted for by the\npresently poor knowledge of the relationship between W and T Bs for various types of soils. An\napproach to quantify the relationship between W and T B S for different soils and thus improve the\nmethod of W estimate is suggested.\n\n111\t\n\nPf^^;F PL.;\'\t\n\n\'NOT FILMED\n\nCONTENTS\npap\n\n....................................................... \t\n\niii\n\n1.\n\nINTRODUCTION ................................................\t\n\n1\n\n2.\n\nMICROWAVE EMISSION MODEL .................................... 2\n\n3.\n\nRESULTS FROM THE CONTROLLED FIELD EXPERIMENT ................ 6\n\n4.\n\nDATA FROM AIRCRAFT FLIGHTS .................................. 9\n\nS.\t\n\nDISCUSSION .................................................. 10\n\nABSTRACT\n\nREFERENCES ..................................................... 13\n\nLIST OF FIGURES\nFigure\t\n\nPage\n\n1\t\n\nThe measured brightness temperature at 1.4GHz plotted vs. the height of\nthe radiometer above a smooth water surface for incident angles 9 of 0\xc2\xb0,\n100 , 20 0 , and 40 0 .

INTRODUCTION\nMicrowave emission from a bare soil depends on moisture content, soil temperature, soil type\nand surface roughness. To remotely estimate the soil moisture content of a bare field by the\ntechnique of microwave radiometry requires a reasonable handling of the three remaining factors\nof soil temperature, soil type, and surface roughness. A number of experiments in the past decade have not only shown a strong correlation between the soil moisture content W in the top few\ncm layers and the brightness temperature T B as measured by the microwave radiometers, but also\nprovided means of minimizing the effects of these three factors (Schmugge, 1980; Schmugge et. al.,\n1974; Burke et. al., 1979; Choudhury et. al., 1979; Newton, 1977; Njoku and Kong, 1977). For\nexample, by normalizing the measured brightness temperature to the effective physical temperature\nof soils, it was possible to retain the strong correlation between the normalized T B and W relatively\nindependent of soil temperature (Schmugge, 1978; Newton, 1977; Wang et. al., 1980). The effect\nof soil types on the microwave emission could be quantified by expressing W in percentage of\nfield capacity (Schmugge, 1978). And from the available data obtained in the past few years\n(Choudhury et. al., 1979; Wang et. al., 1980) it appears possible to parameterize the surface\nroughness effect. Thus, the microwave emission processes from bare soils could be modelled and\nobserved data interpreted with a reasonable degree of confidence.\nThe ultimate objective of soil moisture remote sensing is to invert the observed TB to obtain\nan estimate of W. In the following discussion, a simple approach on the bare soil inversion is\npresented. The discussion is limited to the measured data at 1.4GHz, since most of the past measurements are made at that frequency. It is shown that dual polarized brightness temperature\nmeasurements at incident angles of 30\xc2\xb0-50\xc2\xb0 could be used to determine the surface roughness\nfactor and polarization mixing coefficient. These parameters combined with the measured\n\nTB\n\ngive an estimate of W in the top 0-2cm layer. Two sets of T B data, one from the mobile tower\n1\n\nmeasurement and the other from the low altitude aircraft flight, are used as examples to estimate\nW. In both examples, an offset is observed when the estimated W (or field capacity FC) and the\nmeasured ground truth of W are compared. For the mobile tower measurements, the offset can\nbe accounted for by the soil type effect. For the aircraft measurements, the imperfect knowledge\nof the relation between FC and smooth field T BS, which is essential I in the inversion discussed in\nthis paper, is believed to be the main cause of the offset. Finally, methods to improve the precision of the W estimate from the T $ measurements are suggested and discussed.\n2. MICROWAVE EMISSION MODEL\na. Radiative Transfer. The radiative transfer model for microw sve emission from soils used\nin this study was developed by Wilheit (1978). In this model the air-soil system is divided into\nN dielectrically homogeneous layers, the first layer being the air in contact with the soil surface,\nand the remaining N-1 layers within the soil medium. If fpj(8) (where j is the layer index, 8 is\nthe angle of incidence, and p is the polarization index) is the fraction of electromagnetic energy\nabsorbed in the jth layer, then\nSj\n\nfpj(8) = Sj-1\t\n\n(1)\n\nS,\n\nwhere Sj - 1 is the electromagnetic energy entering the jth layer at the 0-1)th interface, S j is that\nfor the (ii\xe2\x80\xa2 1)th layer at the jth interface, and S l is the incident energy at the first interface. The\nvalues for S 1 , ... , Si are obtained by applying the Poynting\'s theorem to the electromagnetic\nfields from the solutions of the Maxwell\'s equations. If Tj denotes the thermodynamic temperature of the jth layer, then the brightness temperature T Bp(0) observed outside the soil medium is\ngiver, by\nN\n\nTBp(e)\n\n!j.\n=1: fpj(8) Tj + Rp(8) Tsky\t\n=22\n\nwhere Tsky is the brightness temperature equivalent of sky radiation incident on the soil, and\nRp(8) is the reflectivity of soil. By energy conservation Wilheit (1978) obtains:\n\n2\n\n(2)\n\nrN\n\nLe fpj (9) - 1 - Rp(e)\t\n\n(3)\n\nJ02\n\nGiven the soil moisture and temperature profiles and knowing the relationship between the moisture content and the dielectric constant of soils (Wang and Schmugge, 1980), T Bp(9) can be readfly calculated from Eqs. (2) and (3).\nEq. (2) can also be written in terms of the effective soil temperature Teff as\nTBp(e) - (1 - Rp( 8)J Teff \xe2\x99\xa6 \' Rp(9) Tsky\t\n\n(4)\n\n1\nE\n\n(5)\n\nwhen, from Eq. (3)\nN\n\nj\xe2\x80\xa2z\nTeff a\n\nj\n\nfpj (e) Tj\n\nN\t\n\nfpj(e)\n\n=2\n\nTeff is found to be rather insensitive to incident angle, polarization, and soil moisture content W,\nalthough thermal temperature and W do not vary independently. On the other hand, Rpm,\nwhich varies strongly with W, is only weakly dependent on soil temperature (through the slight\ndependence of the soil water\'s dielectric constant on temperature). Since R p(6) for soil is normally 50.4 and Tsky =S\xc2\xb0K (at 1.4GHz), the second term in Eq. (4) represents only a small fraction of the first term. In a number of circumstances, it is convenient to normalize T Bp(9) with\nrespect to Teff and study the variations of the normalized TBp (9) with Rp(6) (or equivalently\nwith W).\nAnalysis performed by Wilheit (1978) also gives the moisture and temperature sampling\ndepths \xe2\x80\x94 the effective depths of soil whose dielectric constant (moisture) and temperature deter,\nmine the reflectivity and the effective temperature. The moisture sampling depth is about one\ntenth of the wavelength, and the thermal sampling depth is a few tenth of the wavelength. Thus\nfor radiometric measurements at 21 em (1.4GHz frequency), the moisture and temperature sampling depths are typically \xe2\x80\x942 em and \xe2\x80\x946 cm respectively.\n3\n\nb. Surface Roughness Effect. The microwave emission model developed by Wilheit (1978)\nis for an ideal smooth air-soil interface. The surfaces of typical agricultural fields on which microwave observations are made for estimating soil moisture content are generally not smooth. The\nroughness characteristics of these fields depend on the nature of cultivation. Some fields may\nhave relatively fiat surface with small clods. Other fields may have surface with irregular small\nand lap undulations in addition to clods. These surface roughness characteristics are difficult\nto quantify and are generally not measured in the practical application of microwave soil moisture\nremote sensing. As a result, a rigorous approach to modelling the surface roughness may have\ndifficulty in experimental verification. Our approach presented in the following is to parameterize\nthe surface roughness effect from the measured microwave T B\'s of the fields. It is shown that the\nincorporation of the surface roughness parameterization to the microwave emission model of\nWilheit (1978) indeed gives a satisfactory account of the measured T B\'s over the bare soil.\nFrom geometrical optics the radiation incident on a dielectric discontinuity will be reflected\nat an angle equal to the angle of incidence (specular reflection). For a smooth surface the surface\nnormals are parallel at all points on the surface, and an incident collimated radiation will remain\ncollimated after reflection. The reflectivity of such a surface is given by Fresnel equations. For\na rough surface, the surface normals at all points are not necessarily parallel, and the average surface reflectivity is no longer governed by Fresnel equations. On such a rough surface the incident\ncollimated radiation is reflected in many directions, and, by energy conservation, the reflectivity\nin the specular direction would be lower than the Fresnel reflectivity. A recent study (Choudhury\net al., 1979) gave the factor by which the smooth reflectivity is lowered as exp (-h cost 0), It being\na parameter characterizing the roughness height.\nThe polarization state of radiation is defined with respect to an orthogonal co-ordinate system at the point of incidence. For a rough surface the orthogonal co-ordinate system can only\nbe defined with respect to the mean smooth surface. If the polarization state is defined with inspect to such a co-ordinate system, the radiation in a polarization state would be a linear\n4\n\ncombination of the radiations in both horizontal and vertical polarizations for a smooth surface.\nBased on these considerations, the horizontal and vertical reflectivities, RH (8) and RH (0), for a\nrough surface may be written as\nR(8) _ [0 - Q) RH ( 0 ) + QRv(8 )l exp (-h C08 2 9)\t\n\n(6)\n\nq(8) - [(1 - Q) Rv(8) + QR H (8)) exp (-h cos2 8)\t\n\n(7)\n\nwhere RH (8) and RV (8) are the Fresnel reflectivities, and Q is the polarization mixing coefficient.\ne.

They also provide an effective means of determining moisture and roughness from remote brightness observations. For example, if the surface roughness of\nthe field is assumed not to vary with time, then the repeated observations of the normalized brightness temperatures would reflect only the varied moisture conditions. A graphical study of the obS\n\nserved X(o) and Y(A), overlaid with the predicted curv y resulting from moisture variation of\nFresnal retlectivities would give an estimate of roughness parameters. Knowing the\n\nroughness\n\npara-\n\nmeters of the field also allows the estimation of the corresponding moisture content by, from Eqs.\n( (8), (9), and (10).\n(1 - Q) 11 - TNrir(8)] + Q 1 1 - TNp;(8)]\t\n\nI1\n\n"\n- TN2V (0)I\n\n(1 - Q) 11- TNI (8)] + Q I 1- TAW(8)] 11- T 0 (8\n)]\nM\nThe relationships between the smooth field normalized brightness temperature pair, TNWO) and\nTrM\nS O), and W would have to be established in this approach.\n\nAt 8 = 0, there is no difference between Ry (0\xc2\xb0) and RV (0\xc2\xb0) and the smooth and rough surface brightness temperatures at the same moisture content are related by:\n-\n\nTNa (O\xc2\xb0) =\n\nI 1 - TNB(0\xc2\xb0)] exp (-h)\t\n\n(14)\n\nKnowing the moisture dependence of the smooth surface brightness temperature TNS (0\xc2\xb0) and the\nparameter It allows an estimate of soil moisture content W from the observed T Nn\ns(0\xc2\xb0). The relation between TNe(0\xc2\xb0) and W\' was established by Mo and Choudhury (1980) for Adelanto loam.\nThe parameter h can be estimated either by making a TN#(0\xc2\xb0) measurement over the\ngiven field at the extremely dry condition or by knowing the measured high and low values\nof TB(W) and the corresponding range of moisture content for the field in question (Choudhury, 1978).\n3. RESULTS FROM THE CONTROLLED FIELD EXPERIMENT\nPart of the formulation discussed in the previous section dealt with 8 = 0\xc2\xb0. For measurements with microwave radiometers mounted on a mobile tower, the data obtained at 8 = 0\xc2\xb0 are\ngenerally of questionable quality because of the contribution from the energy emitted by the\nradiometers and backscattered from the ground surface (Carver, 1978; Wang et. al., 1980). To\n\n6\n\nV\n\nillustrate this effect, Figure 1 shows the measured brightness temperature at the frequency of\n1.4GHz plotted as a function of height H above a smooth water surface (Wang et. al., 1980).\nPlots a, b, c, and d in the figure give the measured results in sequential order for 8 = 0\', 10\',\n\n20\', and 40\'. It is clear from plot a that at 8 = 0\' the effect of the radiometer\'s self emission\nis present at all H. Instead of an expected constant value (without radiometer\'s self emission\neffect) of \xe2\x80\x94 110\'K, To decreases from 2WK at H = 0.6m to \xe2\x80\x9412TK at H = 6m. For 8 a 10\'\n\nS 3m; at H > 3m, TB stays constant with H. Beyond 8 Z 20\',\nthe effect is found to be negligible at all H. In all the 1979 field measurements, H was maintained\nat \xe2\x80\x94 6m for 8 S 30\' and therefore the observed T S s over the 8 range from 10\' to 70\' should be\nthe effect is still present at h\n\nfree from the radiometer\'s self-emission effect. At 8 = 0\', the effect could be present even for a\n\nB\n\nless reflecting surface of soil. As an example. Figure 2 shows the measured T as a function of 8\nfor a smooth bare field in both wet and dry conditions. The smooth curves are the results of the\nmicrowave emission model calculation (Wilheit, 1978) based on the acquired ground truth of soil\nmoisture and temperature profiles and a few adjustable parameters to be discussed later. Note\nthat the measured Ta\'s at 8 = 0\xc2\xb0 are higher than those at 8 = 10\' or 20\' in both dry and wet\nfield conditions, showing the contamination of the backscattered energy emitted by the radiometer. To obtain a set of data suitable for comparison with the 8 = 0\xc2\xb0 results of the previous sec-\n\nB\n\ntion, the average values of the vertically and horizontally polarized T \'s at 8 = 10\xc2\xb0 were d^.rived\n\nB\n\nand regarded as T \'s at 8 = 0\'. Since the rate of change of Ta with 8 is small for 8 5 IV and\n\nTSH (horizontal polarization) and smaller T By (vertical\npolarization) at 8 = 100 , the derived average of T im and Ty V at 8 = 10\' should be a good approximation to the expected TB at 8 = 0\'.\nB\n\nT at 8 = 0\' is expected to be larger than\n\nTo obtain an approximate estimate of the roughness height h and mixing coefficient Q of\nthe bare fields used in the measurements of Wang et. al., (1980), pain of X(8) and Y(8) at 8 = 40\'\nwere derived from the 1.4GHz data given in the same report and plotted in Figure 3a. The soil\nof these bare fields is of Elinsboro sandy loam. The dielectric constant of this soil is assumed to\n\n7\n\nbe similar to that fa: \'ANnwood Street Silt measured by Lundien (1971). Using the acquired\nground truth of moisture and temperature profiles and varying the Q and h values, a series of\nX(40\') and Y(40\') pain were computed by microwave emission model discussed in Section 2.\nWith Q = 0.14 and h n 0. 15, the computed pain of X(40\') and Y(40 0 ) give the solid curve in\nFigure 3a, which generally follows the variational pattern of the measured data. The calculated\nTxv (40\') and Tu, (40\') are compared with the corresponding measured Tay (40 0 ) and TM (400)\nin Figure 3b. The calculated Tav(8) and TSH (8) as a function of 8 are shown as smooth curves\nfor the two data sets in Figure 2. In both figures the agreement between the observed and the\ncalculated remits is quite good.\nAn estimation of soil moisture content W from the observed TNa(8 - 0\') requires the knowledge of the relation between the smooth field\n\nTNS0 n 0\') and W of the soil according to Eq. (13).\n\nSince the exact relationship between TNa(0\') and W for the Elinsboro sandy loam is not known,\nthe one derived by Mo and Choudhury (1980) for the Adelanto loam is employed here. This relation for the soil in top 0-2 cm layer is given by\nTNa(00 ) \' 0.991 - 1.10 W \t\n\n(15)\n\nSubstituting Eq. (1S) into Eq. (14) gives\nW n -0.008 + 0.91 11 - TN\na(0\')1 exp (h)\t\n\n(16)\n\nWith h = 0. 15, the Tn;(0\')\'s for bare fields measured in October 1979 (Wang .-t. al., 1980) were\nsubstituted into Eq. (1S) for estimating W\'s in the top 0-2 cm layer. The estimated Ws were compared with those measured in the top 0-2.5 cm layer in Figure 4. Although the variations of the\nestimated W\'s generally follows with those of the measured W\'s, clearly there is an offset of \xe2\x80\x940.05\ncros/cmj.\nThu offset of 0.05 em3/cm3 can be totally accounted for by the difference in the variations\nof dielectric constant with moisture content between the Elinsboro Sandy Loam and Adlanto\nloam. For example, the wilting point WP (which is defined as the stage of soil-water system\n\n8\n\nwhere soil tension is about 15 atmospheres) of Adlanto loam is \xe2\x80\x94 0.1 S2. When the two parameters charac%rizin= the variation between dielectric constant and moisture content for WP = 0.1 52\nwere derived ("Wang and Schmusge, 1980) and entered in the emission model calculations for the\nground truth soil moisture and temperature profiles of 1979 measurements, the calculated TNAZOYs\nwere found to be 0.046 higher than the measured one. Higher TNa(W) gives smaller estimated\nW from Eq. (16). To produce an offset of 0.05cro 3/cm 3 in W from Eq. (16) requires an increase\nin TNs(0\') of 0.047, which is close to the 0.046 value resulting\n\nfrom\n\nemission model calculations.\n\n4. DATA FROM AIRCRAFT FLIGHTS\nThe data obtained from the airborne microwave radiometer experiments normally show a\nlarger scatter in the Ts vs. W plot when compared to a similar plot of data obtained from a controlled field experiment by radiometers mounted on a mobile tower. This is mainly because\nmany bare fields with different soil types and surface roughnesses are included in the airborne\nradiometer experiments. Figure S shows a Ta at 1.4GHz vs. FC (field capacity FC is defined as\nthe stage of soil-water system when the soil tension is about 113 atmosphere) plot reproduced\nfrom the report of Choudhury et. al., (1979) for aircraft flight data taken in 1972 and 1973 over\nPhoenix, Arizona (Schmugge et. al., 1976). Although the effect of soil type is minimized by\nnormallzins the moisture content to percentage of FC, the large scatter of data points is evident.\nThe effect of soil temperature may be present, but judging from the large scatter even within\neach year\'s data set, the surface roughness effect is likely to be the dominant factor. The solid\nand dashed curves in the figure are the results of the emission model calculations with different\nsurface roughness factors of 0 and 0.45, using the moisture and temperature profiles measured by\nthe personnel at the U.S. Water Conservation Laboratory at Phoenix (Jackson, 1973). Clearly, a\nlarge difference in Ts due to different surface rou hnesses at same W is expected from the Onoretleal calculations.\nEstimation cf W from the observed Ta s of an aircraft slight data set requires a different\napproach to establish the relationship between TSa(W) and W and to estimate the factor h from\n\n9\n\nEq. (14). Fust, FC rather than W is used in order to minimize the soil type effect. In the following example, the relationship between TNB and FC was derived from the smooth field data set\nobtained by Newton (1974) with a mobile tower. The result (for 0-2 cm layer) was given by\n(Choudhury, 1978):\nFC - -1.49 + 169.6 11 - TNB(0\xc2\xb0)]\t\n\n(17)\n\nSecondly, because bare fields of many different surface roughnesses were involved in the measurements, only the average value for h would be used. The h value estimated for the March 1975\naircraft flight data was 0.6 (Choudhury et. al., 1979). Combining Eqs. (14) and (17) with h =\n0.6, the estimated FC\'s from the observed Ti\'s at 8 - 0\xc2\xb0 were derived and compared with the\nacquired ground truth of FC\'s in Figure 6. Although the variations of the estimated and the\nmeasured FC\'s follow the 1:1 slope, the estimated FC\'s are about 10% lower than the measured\nones.\nThe reason for the \xe2\x80\x94 i0% FC offset most likely originates from the relationship between FC\nand TA as given by Eq. (17). That relationship is derived from the radiometric measurements\nby a mobile tower at B = 0\xc2\xb0 (Newton, 1975). As noted in the previous section, the radiometric\nmeasurements by a mobile tower at 8 = W might include contributions from the radiometer\'s\nself-emitted energy backscattered from the flat soil surface. A higher TN9 (0\xc2\xb0) would lower the\nestimated FC and it only needs a small fraction of the self-emitted energy to account for the\nobserved offset. For example, a 10% change in FC from Eq. (17) requires a corresponding\nchange in TN9 (0\xc2\xb0) of 0.03 which is approximately equal to a \xe2\x80\x948\xc2\xb0K change in brightness temperature. Contributions from the radiometer\'s self-emission of 8\xc2\xb0K or higher at 8 - 0\xc2\xb0 in the mobile\ntower measurements over a flat bare field were rather common in the experimental data reported\nby Wang et. al., (1980).\n5. DISCUSSION\nA simple method of estimating the soil moisture content at the top few centimeter layer of\nbare soil from the observed brightness temperature is presented in the previous sections. Besides\n10\n\nthe required inputs of the measured brightness temperature normalized to the effective soil temperature, the method calls for the determinations of the surface roughness height h (or polarization\nmixing coefficient Q) and of the functional relationship between the soil moisture content W and\nthe smooth bare field normalized brightness temperature TN$ . The two examples given in the last\ntwo sections clearly illustrate these needs. Although the estimated W\'s (or field capacity FC\'s) generally follow the measured W\'s (or FC\'s), an offset exists in the estimated W vs. measured W plots\ni\nfrom either the mobile tower measurements or the a rcraft experiments, suggesting an insufficient\nknowledge of W and TNa relation and possibly of the factor h.\nIt was pointed out in Section 4 that h determined from the aircraft data and used in the\nestimate of FC was the average value of many fields with different surface roughnesses. The use\nof h determined in this way may result in an appreciable uncertainty in the FC estimate for an\nindividual field. A better way of obtaining the appropriate roughness parameters is first to generate a family of theoretical curves for X and Y pairs with h and Q values at off-nadir angle\n(e.g., 9 = 40\xc2\xb0) using many different moisture profiles. The radiometric measurements over many\nindividual fields are made at the same @ in both vertical and horizontal polarizations. The expe,imental pair of X and Y values ara then derived from the measured TN BV (6) and TNR(0) and\ncompared with the theoretical curves to obtain Q and h for each field. The estimate of W (or FC)\nfrom the measured T14R (0) and TNR (0) is then made from Eq. (13), if t!!- relationships between\nBH\nW and T NBV ) and TNSV(6) are known.\nThe effect of soil type on the soil moisture estimate can be taken into account by either one\nof the two methods below. The first method is to estimate the moisture content in terms of percent field capacity FC from the observed TNev(0) and T N R (6). The true moisture content of\nindividual fields can then be obtained by conversion from FC, knowing the texture structure of\nthe fields. The precise knowledge of the functional dependence between FC and the smooth\nfield brightness temperature pair, TNs 0) and TNBWB), is required. The second method is to\n\ngenerate a number of pairs of linear equations relating W and TNW,(@) and Tj (0) similar to\nEq. (14) for 8 = 0\xc2\xb0. Each pair of equations give the linear relations between W and T NS(8), and\nbetween W and TNS(8) for a given soil type. This can be accomplished by assuming soils of\nmany different textures and, for each soil texture, making brightness temperature calculation\nwith many different soil moisture and temperature profiles (Mo and Choudhury, 1980). The and\nproduct of this exercise is a functional dependence of the coefficients a and P. which appear in\nthe liner relation between W and TNSV(0) (or TNI(8)), on soil type. The existence of such a\nfunctional dependence enables one to choose the proper values of a and P for a field of known\nsoil texture and an estimate of W can be obtained from the measured TNBRir (8) and TNR (8)\nthrough Eq. (13).\nEven with the insufficient knowledge of the relation between W (or FC) and TNB(0\xc2\xb0), the\nresults shown in Figures 4 and 6 from the simple method of estimating the soil moisture content\nare indeed encouraging. The offsets in both figures should be reduced f a more precise relation\nbetween W and TNB(0\xc2\xb0) was used. More radiometric measurements, especially at off-nadir incident argles with both vertical and horizontal polarizations, with a variety of soils are desired in\norder to test the method more fully.\n\n12\n\nREFERENCES\nBurke, W.

Abetrat.f\nA simple method of estimating moisture content W of a bare soil from the observed brightness temperature T8 at 1.4GHz is discussed in this paper. The method is based on a radiative\ntransfer model calculation (Wilheit, 1978), which has been successfully used in the past to account for many observational results (Choudhury et. al., 1979), with some modifications to\ntake into account the effect of surface roughness. Besides the measured Tti s, the three additional inputs required by the method are the effective soil thermodynamic temperature, the\nprecise relation between W and the smooth field brightness temperature Ta s , and a parameter\nspecifying the surface roughness characteristics. The soil effective temperature can be readily\nmeasured, and the procedures of estimating surface roughness parameter and of obtaining the\nrelation between W and Te gre discusscd in detail.\nIt is pointed out that dual polarized radiometric measurements at an off-nadir incident\nangle 8 are sufficient to estimate both surface roughness parameter and W, provided that the\nrelation between W and T S at the same 8 is known. Since the relation between W and TINS is\nknown only at 8 * 8\xc2\xb0 for Idlanto loam, the method of W estimate is demonstrated with two\nsets of experimental data at 8 - 8\xc2\xb0, one from a controlled field experiment by a mobile tower\nand the other, from aircraft overflight. The results from both data sets are encouraging when the\nestimated W\'s are compared with the acquired ground truth of W\'s in the top 2cm layer. An\noffset between the estimated and the measured W\'s exists in the results of the analyses, but\nthat can be accounted for by the presently poor knowledge of the relationship between W and\nTaS for various types of soils. An approach to quantify the relationship between W and TINS\nfor different soils and thus improve the method of W estimate is suggested.\n17. Key Words (Selected by Author(s))\t\n16.
