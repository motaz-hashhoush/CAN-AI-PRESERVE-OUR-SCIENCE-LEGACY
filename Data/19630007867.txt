Shepard, Jr., 39, is his back-up pilot.\n\n- more-\n\n-3The 14 other astronauts will serve as flight controllers\nfrom vantage points around the world, and as trainee observers.\nAstronaut Walter H. Schirra, Jr., will serve as Cap Com (Capsule\nCommunicator) at Cape Canaveral.\n\nAstronaut John H. Glenn, Jr.,\n\nwill serve as Cap Com aboard the Pacific Command Ship, while\nAstronaut Mo Scott Carpenter will be stationed as Cap Com on\nKauai Island, Hawaii.\n\nAstronaut Virgil I. Grissom will be Cap\n\nCom at the Guaymas, r1exico, station.\nThe nine astronauts, who were selected to augment the original seven astronauts in future Gemini and Apollo flights, will\nbe assigned to Cape Canaveral under the direction of Astronaut\nDonald K. Slayton for mission orientation.\n\nThey are:\n\nNeil A.\n\nArmstrong, Frank Borman, Charles Conrad, Jr., James Ao Lovell,\nJr., James A. McDivitt , Elliot H. See, Jr o , Thomas p. Stafford,\nEdward H. vfuite, II, and John W. Young.\nIn evaluating the benefits of extended flight time, NASA\n\nofficials point out that lithe text books on theory have been\nexchanged for text books on fact.1I\nThe upcoming MA-9 flight spacecraft, having shown tremendous flexibi lity and capability for modification, more closely\nresembles a true bionics system.\n\nThe Atlas launch vehicle,\n\nhaving earned additional confidence in its man-rated qualities,\nhas undergone change with its new wiring system.\n- more-\n\nThe astronauts\n\n-4have changed through their flight training and actual space\nflight experiences, proving themselves space pilots rather\nthan spacecraft passengers o\n\nThe Mercury controllers and\n\nplanners have also changed and taken on new confidence, born\nof experience, that they can meet the unexpected problems which\narise in flight tests.\nExtended Mercury missions function at full value for basic\nscience and technology.\n\nScientists are providing astronauts\n\nvdth specific instrumentation in order to combine and exploit\nthe unique capabilities of man with his OvID scientific sensors\nand instruments.\nProject Mercury is under the technical and operational\ndirection of NASAls Manned Spacecraft Center , Houston, Texas.\nI\\\'lSC, Marshall Space Flight Center and Launch Operations Center,\nare the three NASA centers engaged primarily in manned space\nflight projects, under the over-all direction and management\nof the NASA Office of l\'-1anned Space Flight, Washington, Do C.\n2.\n\nORBITAL TRACK\n\nThe orbital track of a 22-orbit mission will carry Astronaut\nCooper over more than 100 countries, islands and possessions.\nOn his first orbit, the MA-9 pilot will leave the United States,\ncross the Atlantic, the African continent, Indian Ocean,\nAustralia, the Pacific, Mexic o and the southern United States in\nan orbit ranging 32-~ degrees north and south of the equator ..\nBeginning with the 16 th orbit" the spacecraft will follow the\nearth tracks of the initial orbits.\n\n-more-\n\n-53.\n\nfvlA-9 EXPERIMENTS\n\nExperiments scheduled during the fvlA-9 mission include:\naeromedical studies, flashing beacon experiment, dim light\nphenomenon photographs, horizon definition experiments, radiation measurements, tethered balloon experiment, infrared\nweather photographs, television system operation, cabin\nenvironmental temperature study, HF antenna test, ground light\nexperiment, window attenuation evaluation, and white patch\ntemperature experiment 9\n~1EDICAL\n\nSTUDIES\n\nOBJECTIVES -- A 22-orbit mission will allow an evaluation\nof\n\n~anls\n\ncardiovascular system response to extended orbital\n\nflight conditions.\n\nIn addition, observations and measured\n\nphysiological parameters can be used to assess the adequacy\nof the spacecraft environment and the function of life support\nsystems.\n\nAnalysis of this information will insure the pilot\'s\n\nwell-being, particularly his medical condition.\nREST PERIODS -- Sufficient rest, eating, and drinking periods are scheduled during the flight so that the pilot can maintain the proper hydration, nutrition, and physiological reserves\nof energy required throughout the mission.\n\n-more-\n\n7\n\n-6The pilot is allowed a total of eight hours for sleep;\nthis period is scheduled to begin -- at the option of the\npilot -- in the ninth orbit during drifting flight.\n\nThe\n\ng round station at Muchea will send a wake-up signal to the\nspacecraft during the 15th orbit as determined by the Flight\nDirector.\n\nThe pilot may elect to take a stimulant (Dexadrine )\n\nto insure alertness for the remainder of the fli ghto\nURINARY TEST -- A study of the pilot\'s water balance and\nkidney function will be made by comparing body weight before\nand after the flight, by recording water intake during fli ght ,\nand by analyzing urine samples collected at specific intervals\nthroughout the fli ght.\nBODY TEMPERATURE -- A new oral temperature measur.ing device for the MA- 9 mission consists of a thermister i mbedded\nin a latex probeo\n\nThe probe is stowed on the ri gh t ear m\nuff\n\ninside the helmet j the pilot must open the visor to insert the\nprobe under his tongue .\n\nFour measurements of tem\nperature are\n\nplanned during the fli ght.\n\nThe instrument has a temperature\n\nrange of from 75 to 150 degrees F. and will provide a backup\nindication of suit temperature when not being used for its primary purpose.\n\nThe oral device repl ace s a rectal probe used in\n\nearlier flights e\n\n-more -\n\n8\n\n-7BLOOD PRESSURE -- Blood pressure readings will be taken\nwith a tailored occluding cuff on the upper left arm with a\nmicrophone under the lower edge of the cuff and positioned\nover the brachial artery.\n\nThe pilot will depress the blood\n\npressure START button on the left instrument panel to inflate\nthe cuff for a reading .\nECG -- The pilot\'s ECG readings will come from four sensors located on the torso.\nsensors to\n\ndeter~~ne\n\nThe pneumograph uses two chest\n\nrespiration rateo\n\nThe pneumograph sen-\n\nsors are located at the sixth rib level.\npiration are transmitted and recorded\nEXERCISE -- The\n\n~ffi-9\n\nBoth ECG and res-\n\nautomatical~y.\n\npilot has two periods scheduled dur-\n\ning the flight to perform a calibrated exercise study as a\nmeasured stress on the cardiovascular system.\n\nThis exercise\n\nwill also serve to tone up the body during the long muscular\ninactivity of the flight.\n\nThe first of the exercise periods--\n\nincluding the blood pressure measurements--is scheduled to\noccur during the pass over Australia; it will provide baseline data for medical evaluation early in the flight.\nEXERCISE DEVICE -- The pilot\'s exercise device consists\nof a conveniently located two-hand grip anchored to the spacecraft structure by stretchable or bungee cord and a loose.,\nnonstretching line to limit the length of travel.\n\nPulling the\n\nhand grip full out requires a precise quantity of work measured\nin foot pounds--60 to 65 foot pounds per pull with one pull\n-more-\n\n9\n\n-8per second during the exercise periods on the second and\nseventh orbits.\n\nTherefore, accomplishing a specified num-\n\nber of full extensions imposes a calibrated work load on\nthe piloto\n\nVariations in the measured physiological para-\n\nmeters during and after an exercise period will be used to\nevaluate cardiovascular functions.\nFOOD - - The\ntypes:\n\n~ffi-9\n\nfood supply will consist of two main\n\na ready-to-eat, bite-sized food in sufficient quantity\n\nto satisfy all caloric requirements; and the experimental,\nGemini-type, dehydrated food and drink prepacked in plastic\ncontainers for reconstitution during flight.\n\nPreparation of\n\nthe dehydrated food requires the addition of water--the containers have nozzles through which water is added and through\nwhich the food or drink is forced out after hydration.\n\nThe\n\nrehydrated drink will be ready for consumption shortly after\nthe water is added.\n\nThe rehydrated food will require about\n\nfive minutes of mixing.\n\nCooper will carry a food supply\n\ntotaling 2376 calories, including such meals as spaghetti\nand meat sauce and a beef and gravy dinner.\n\n10\n\n-more-\n\n-9ADDITIONAL EXPERIMENTS\nFLASHING BEACON EXPERIMENT -- The purpose of this experiment is to help evaluate the capability of the pilot in acquiring a flashing beacon light of known intensity at distances\nof up to 15 miles from the spacecraft in the space environment.\nThis experiment is associated with Gemini and Apollo missions\nwhere visual sighting will serve as a means for rendezvous.\nIt is necessary to obtain data on what visual acquisition capabilities are required for sightings at various ranges.\nThis experiment utilizes two flashing xenon lights.\ntery\n\npowered~\n\nten-pound~\n\nthe lights are mounted on opposite sides of a\n\n5.75-inch-diameter sphere.\n\none flash per\n\nBat-\n\nsecond~\n\napproximately\n\nThe lights radiate about\n\nomnidirectionally~\n\nand are\n\ndesigned to equal a star magnitude of plus two -- or about the\nsame magnitude as Polaris (North Star) -- at a distance of six\nto eight nautical miles.\nThe sphere is mounted in a cylindrical canister on the\nretropack in such a way\n\nthat~\n\nwhen the spacecraft is at a pitch-\n\ndown attitude of 20 degrees to the\n\nhorizon~\n\nbe aligned to the proper ejection angle.\n\nthe retropack will\n\nUnder this\n\ncondition~\n\nthe sphere will be launched down (10 feet per second) by a\nspring device at angle of 92 degrees with the flight path.\n\n- more -\n\n11\n\n-10-\n\nThis will put the sphere into a sli ghtly different orbit than\nthat of the spacecraft, causing the two to drift\n\napart.\n\nThe sphere will be released about 15 minutes before sunset on the third orbit approaching the coast of Africa.\n\nThe\n\npilot will repeat sightings at ten-minute intervals during the\nnext thre e night phases and\n\nif possible -- during the first\n\nintervening daylight phase.\n\nHe will comment on the appearance\n\nof the light against the star or Earth background, describe i ts\nease of acquisition, and estimate its relative position from\nthe\n\nspacecraft.\nDIM LIGHT PHENOMENON PHOTOGRAPHY -- This experiment will\n\ngather photographic data of two dim light phenomena which are\nbest observed from outside Earth\'s atmosphere -- Zodiacal li ght\nand the night airglow laye r.\n\nPhotographs of Zodiacal li ght\n\nwill help scientists to determine the light\'s exact origin,\nge ome tric distribution, and its us efulnes s in studyi ng solar\nradiation and flare activity.\n\nData on the airglow will pro-\n\nvide further information on the solar energy conve rsion processes occurring in the uppe r atmosphere .\nThe nature of Zodiacal li ght is b e lieved to be sunlight\nreflected from fre e e lectrons a nd large dust particles in the\ne cliptic plane, distributed outward from the sun in interplanetary space, or in ge ocentric orbits about Earth.\n\nThe\n\nintensity of the Zodiacal li ght is relatively weak, and measurements from Earth\'s surface ar e inhibited by scattering and\n\nJ2\n- more -\n\n-11-\n\nabsorption of light in our atmosphere.\n\nMeasurements of corona\n\nintensity within two degrees of the sun\'s disk during solar\neclipses show a bright halo; other measurements near the plane\nof the e cliptic up to 30 degrees ahead of sunrise or behind\nsunset indicate a possible light intensity relationship to the\nsolar halo.\n\nDuring the MA-9 flight, the pilot will attempt to\n\nobtain time exposures on color film covering the ecliptic region after sunset on the 16th orbit between two degrees and\n30 degrees from the sun to ascertain if Zodiacal light is a\ncontinuous phenomena or if it arises from the two distinct\nprocesses.\nThe airglovl consists of a weak continuum in the visible\nspectrum and has three distinct colors -- yellow from the sodium D lines and green and red lines, the latter two being\nattributed to "forbidden" transitions in the energy states of\natomic oxygen.\n\nRe cent work in this area of science is reported\n\nto indicate that the red occurs near 400 kW altitude while the\ngreen is prevalent at 90 km.\n\nTime exposures using the color\n\nfilm and a modified camera throughout the night phase may return data on the altitudes and intensities of the various strata\nas well as their change in appearance at different latitudes.\n\n- more -\n\n13\n\n-12-\n\nIn order to perform these studies accurately, the pilot\nwill make maximum use of the ASCS (automatic control) so that\nhe can devote most of his attention to the timing of his photographs.\n\nJust after sunset, the pilot will begin the first of\n\nfour sequences of Zodiacal light photographs.\n\nThe photographs\n\nwill begin 15 seconds after the sun disappears below the horizon.\n\nThe airglow will be photographed in sequences throughout\n\nthe remainder of the night phase with five minute intervals\nbetween sequences.\n\nEach sequence will consist of three photo-\n\ngraphs -- a two-minute exposure, a 30-second exposure and a\nten-second exposure with a minimum of delay between exposures.\nAt morning twilight, the sequence will be changed to one final\nseries of a 30-second exposure immediately followed by a sevensecond exposure taken every two minutes.\nPhotographic equipment provided for this experiment will\nconsist of a 35 mm camera modified with a special F.6 lens systern provided by the University of Minnesota, originator of the\nproposal for this study.\n\nThe camera weighs about three pounds\n\nincluding its 50 frames of preloaded and calibrated film.\nHORIZON DEFINITION EXPERIMENT (MIT) -- The horizon definition experiment will study Earth\'s sunlit horizon and atmosphere to determine if it can be used as a reliable sextant\nreference during the midcourse phase of translunar missions.\nPhotographic test results will be of direct use to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Instrumentation Laboratory\n\n14\n\n- more -\n\n-13in the development of the Apollo guidance and navi gation system.\nThis experiment is a continuing effort to accurately define a suitably invariant horizon line in the atmosphere near\nEarth\'s surface that remains independent of changing atmospheric\nconditions.\n\nPhotographic observations of Earth\'s horizon and\n\natmosphere were made on MA-7 through blue and red filters to\ndiscover if there is a point of sharp cutoff in either spectral\nregion of the horizon or atmosphere which can be used for accurate navigation sightings, but the results were not completely\nconclusive.\n\nPhotographs to be taken on the MA-9 flight will\n\nbe used to investigate two specific problems to (1) indicate\na specific altitude for a well-defined line, and (2) resolve\nuncertainties arising from the atmospheric scattering of incident sunlight.\n\nUseful data will include red and blue filtered,\n\ndaylight photographs of the horizon and atmosphere taken at\neven intervals as the spacecraft crosses the sunlit portion\nof Earth.\n\nPhotographs will also be taken during a short period\n\nof all four quadrants of Earth\'s surface and, if possible, at\na known time when the rising or setting moon would also appear\nin the picture.\n\nThe first tv,ro seri e s of photographs would pro-\n\nvide excellent comparisons of the horizon and atmosphere through\nvarying sunlight-scattering angles.\nThis experiment requires a 70 mm camera and a magazine\ncontaining the red and blue filter strips mounted just ahead\n\n1)\n\n- more -\n\n-14of the film p lane .\n\nNIT wi ll supply this maga zi n e with filt e rs\n\nand black and whit e film suitably calibrate d with step-vledge\nexp osures before and afte r fli ght for r e f e rence during the\nmicrodensitome t er analysis of results.\nThe special film magazine will be attache d to the came ra\nduring the 16th orbit prior to th e beginni ng of the quadrant\nphotographs.\n\nThe pilot wi ll tak e eight picture s of the\n\nhorizon~\n\ntvlO i n each quadrant as he performs a p i tch- down~ yawing maneu-\n\nve r.\n\nThe qua drants wi ll be chos en so that two of the pic t ur e s\n\nwill be taken toward the azimuth of the sun.\nDuring the 21st\n\norbit~\n\nwhe n the spac e craft is on automatic\n\ncontrol, the p i lot will take approximat e ly six or s eve n s e ts\nof thre e photographs each looking aft.\n\nThe photographs will\n\nbe e venly s eparated i n time (about s ix minut e s) so that the y\ncove r the entire dayl ight p e riod.\nA s e quenc e of photographs inclu di nc the moon wi th the\nhorizon will also b e take n, if the occasion conveni ently pre s ents itse lf at any time dur i ng the fli ght.\nRADIATION flffiASUREfvIENT EXPERIfl1ENT -- The obj e ctive of thi s\nexp e riment is to me asure radiation at Me rcury orbital altitude s.\nThis will provi de a survey of fission e lectrons trapped in the\nlower re gions of Earth\'s magnetic field approaching closest to\n\n16\n- more -\n\n-15Earth\'s surface over eastern South America and the South Atlantic.\n\nThis will give additional data on the decay of the\n\nartifical radiation belt created by high altitude nuclear detonations.\nOne of two Geiger counters mounted on the retropack will\nview radiation flux from a hemispherical area.\n\nThis Geiger\n\ncounter surveys a region unobstructed by the spacecraft and\nis unaffected by radiation scattered by the spacecraft structure.\n\nThe second Geiger counter is shielded to register in-\n\ncoming radiation directly ahead of the heat shield region.\nUseful data from these Geiger counters will be recorded\nany time when the radiation experiment switch is ON, when the\ntape recorder is running J and when the radiation levels are\nwithin the range of the instruments.\nTrapped fission electrons spiraling along Earth\'s magnetic\nflux lines (with energies below 7 MEV) will be the primary\nsource of the radiation to be measured.\nattitudes are known\n\nJ\n\nvfuen the spacecraft\n\na crude estimate may be made concerning\n\npreferential direction of the incoming radiation.\n\nData obtained\n\nshould provide a qualitative test of the assumption that radiation near the spacecraft is isotropic or the same regardless\nof the direction of the measurement.\n\n17\n- more 685583 C>- 63 --2\n\n-16A pocket ion chaffiber(O-200 milliroentgen dosimeter) stowed\nin the Ditty Bag prior to launch will be secured to the hatch\nabout ten minutes after launch.\n\nA radiation detecting film\n\npatch will also be attached to the hatch.\n\nThe ion chamber and\n\nthe film patch will give a rough measurement of the total interior radiation.\n\nThe radiation reaching the pilot will be\n\nmeasured by four film patches worn beneath the astronaut\'s\npressure suit -- one inside the helmet near the left ear muff,\none on the right thigh, and two in the chest region.\nIn addition, one photographic emulsion pack will be carried\nin the spacecraft cabin and will be located above the left instrument panel.\n\nThis high-energy particle detector has been\n\nprovided by the U.S. Navy School of Aviation Medicine.\n\nThe\n\npack contains a stack of eight glass plates coated with photographic emulsion sensitive to protons and galactic cosmic rays.\nSufficiently energetic protons trapped in Earth\'s radiation\nbelts will also be recorded.\n\nAfter the\n\nfligh~\n\na microscopic\n\ninspection of the developed grain density in the emulsion along\nthe ionization path of the incident particles will measure\ntheir energy loss through the pack; this can be used as direct\nor, in some cases, indirect evidence of total particle energy.\nTETHERED BALLOON -- The tethered balloon experiment -attempted first on the MA-7 flight -- has two objectives:\n\n18\n- more -\n\n-17an aerodynamic study and a visual test.\n\nThe measurement of\n\natmospheric drag on a known aerodynamic shape along the Mercury\norbit should provide a more accurate measurement of atmospheric\ndensity in that region.\n\nInformation on aerodynamic stability\n\nand damping will also be obtained.\n\nVisually, the balloon will\n\nprovide a conveniently-located space object for tracking and\nranging after its release from the towed posit i on.\nThe balloon and small nitrogen inflation bottle are packaged together in a three-inch-diameter cylindrical container\nlocated in the antenna canister under the destabilizing flap.\nThe container door will open, and the deflated balloon and bottle will be ejected by a compressed spring and piston with the\nlOO-foot-10ng, five-pound test, nylon tethering line between\nthe balloon and a strain gauge beam in the spacecraft.\n\nWhen\n\nthe package clears the container, a spring-loaded valve on the\nnitrogen bottle will open, and the balloon will inflate to a\n30-inch-diameter sphere in less than one second.\nThe balloon is fabricated of two-ply Mylar, 0.6 mil thick.\nIt is coated with a flourescent orange Day-G10 finish.\nOne end of the nitrogen bottle is attached to the balloon\nwhile the other end is fastened to a roll of annealed aluminum f oil eight feet long .\n\nThis foil serves as a shock absorber\n\nby u nrolling during deployment.\n\n19\n- more -\n\n-18The outer end or the tethering line is attached to the\nshock absorber, and its other end is connected to the free\nend of a cantilevered strain gauge beam located at the bottom\nof the balloon container in the spacecraft.\n\nAeTodynamic drag\n\non the balloon transmitted through the tethering line causes\na pull which is registered by the strain gauge and recorded\nonboard.\n\n(The maximum drag force will occur at perigee and\n\nis expected to be on the order of 0.015 pounds.)\n\nAt the com-\n\npletion of the experiment, the balloon will be cut free and\ntracked.\n\nThis will give some idea of fuel usage versus accuracy\n\nduring precision tracking in space and also will provide the\npilot with a known object for estimations of range and appearance.\nBalloon deployment is proposed for approximately five minutes after sunrise on the sixth orbit.\n\nPrior to deployment,\n\nthe 16 mm camera with wide-angle lens will be mounted in its\nbracket and turned on to record the balloon extension sequence.\nAfter deployment, the pilot will pitch down five to ten\ndegrees -- slowly -- in order to observe and comment on motions\nof the balloon.\n\nThe balloon should be relatively stabilized\n\nwithin about 90 seconds; the camera will be turned off at this\npoint.\nDuring the towed phase of this experiment, motions of\nthe balloon induced by attitude changes of the spacecraft will\n\n20\n- more -\n\n-19be kept to a minimum.\n\nThe pilot will comment on all observa-\n\ntions and spacecraft maneuvering for onboard recording; this\nwill include times, spacecraft attitudes and rates as well as\nthe relative position of the balloon, whether or not the line\nis taut, period and amplitude of balloon oscillations, apparent color or shape changes, angle of lighting, and its appearance against the sky or Earth backgrounds.\n\nThe 16 mm camera\n\nwith wide angl e l ens will also be used ror rour or five sequences\nof the balloon and its motions during the towed phase.\nJust prior to the balloon jettison, half way through the\nseventh orbit, the 16 mm camera with telephoto lens will be\nstarted.\n\nThe precision tracking task requires that the pilot\n\nhold the retro attitude horizon scribe mark in the window on\nthe balloon for approximately - two minutes as it recedes and\ndrops below the spacecraft.\n\nThereafter, the pilot will note\n\nthe appearance and ease of sighting from general observations;\nin about five minutes, the balloon should be near the visual\nlimit on the horizon and nearly three miles away.\nINFRARED WEATHER PHOTOGRAPHY -- The s eries of weather\nphotographs will use infrared film and filters for the study\nof weather phenomena from orbital altitudes.\n\nThe ultimate pur-\n\npose is basic information on infrared reflectance from the\nEarth-atmosphere and design data f or- instrumentation going\ninto future meteorological satellites.\n\nc:2/\n- more -\n\nFilm resuts should\n\n-20-\n\nprovide valuable information on spectral characteristics of\nthe cloud and Earth radiances, of sunlight scattering by large\naerosols, and of contrast variation with wave length.\nA Hasselblad camera with 70 mm film and 80 mm lens will\nbe used for this photography.\n\nA holder containing the three\n\nfilters will be inserted into the magazine loaded with infrared\nsensitive film.\n\nThe U.S. Weather Bureau proposed this task\n\nand is responsible for processing and sensitometric calibration\nof the film.\nExecution of this experiment is planned during the 17th\nand 18th orbits; at his own discretion, the pilot may choose\nadditional times.\n\nThe control mode for this study will generally\n\nbe drifting flight.\nTELEVISION CAMERA EVALUATION -- A special television camera\nwill be carried on this flight for the first time to test its\noperational value for monitoring the pilot\'s well being, for\nobtaining backup readings of the instrument panel indications,\nand for observing tests, experiments and external phenomena\nthrough the spacecraft window.\n\nThis may determine the need\n\nand value of such a technique for obtaining data on future manned\nspace flights.\nThe ten-pound camera can be hand-held or mounted on a bracket to the right of the pilot\'s hand controller.\n\n22\n- more -\n\nA special\n\n-21-\n\ntelemetry transmitter has been added to the spacecraft to transmit the TV output directly to the ground during telemetry contact at selected

obtained only\n\nwhen the spacecraft is in t e l eme try contact with a ground station properly equipp e d to accept the TV signals.\n\nIn order to\n\nobtain adequate picture definition within the space and weight\nrestrictions imposed on the flight equipment, the scan rate has\nbeen reduced to 0.5 frames per second.\n\nThis necessitates special\n\nequipment on the ground to reconstruct the picture for immediate\nviewing.\n\nAt MCC the flight surgeon will have access to a real-\n\ntime monitor modified to use the two second scan speed.\n\nFive\n\nother TV monitors will also see the

matter and will\nbe determined during flight by the pilot with advice from the\nmonitoring ground station.\nCABIN ENVIRONMENTAL TEMPERATURE STUDY -- This test will\nyield information on the temperature balance within the spacecraft cabin without the cabin coolant system in operation.\nThis has not been attempted on prior flights.\n\nIt is predicted\n\nthat the maximum stable temperature reached without coolant will\nbe within the tolerable limits of the cabin equipment and the\npilot; the pilot\n\nwill be using suit cooling circuit only.\n\nThis test should provide engineering design data for future\nheat exchanger systems.\nNo equipment other than the usual spacecraft systems is\nrequired for this test.\n\nThe test is scheduled for the begin-\n\nning of the fifth orbit after the cabin has achieved generally\nstabilized temperatures.\n\nThe cabin coolant valve will be turned\n\noff and cabin temperature monitored by both the pilot and the\nground stations.\n\nSuit temperature readings will also be monitored\n\n21\n- more -\n\n-23and settings adjusted appropriately, since the suit circuit\nwill have to bear an added portion of the heat load.\nPrior to the start of the test, the pilot will record cabin\nair temperature, cabin and suit heat exchanger dome temperatures,\nsuit temperature and the coolant valve settings for both the\ncabin and the suit.\n\nHe will then switch the cabin fan off and\n\nclose the cabin temperature control.\n\nAt several minute inter-\n\nvals and whenever suit coolant valve changes are necessary, he\nwill record time and the above mentioned temperatures and coolant\nvalve settings,.\n\nElectrical loads and inverter temperatures\n\nwill be checked frequently until temperatures are stabilized\nto insure that no failures are imminent from overheating equipment.\nIf temperatures remain stable within test limits, the cabin\nfan and water coolant will remain off until approximately two\nhours before retrosequence.\n\nThis will include the rest p eriod,\n\nif temperatures remain at a safe level and have been stable for\nseveral hours.\nHF ANTENNA TEST\n\nAnother first-time experiment, this will\n\nprovide measurements of antenna polarization and atmospheric\neffects associated with HF communications between an orbiting\nvehicle and ground stations.\n\nResults will be directly applica-\n\nble to the vertically polarized HF antenna to be used on the\nGemini spacecraft.\n\n- more -\n\n-24The operational procedure for this test requires two HF\ntransmissions from the\n\nspacecraft~\n\none with a 28-foot-Iong\n\nantenna in a horizontal position (horizontally polarized)~ and\nthe other with the spacecraft rolled 90 degrees so that the dipole\npoints toward the center of Earth (vertically polarized).\n\nThe\n\ntest of the two orientations will be performed over an area just\nnorth of Panama so that the spacecraft is fairly close to receiving stations where reasonable reception and good coverage of\nthe region just beyond line-of-sight are expected.\nThis test will be conducted a second time 20 minutes later\nover the South Atlantic in a remote area where long ranges well\nbeyond line-of-sight are required for station contact.\n\nAbout\n\nfive minutes will be required to make a call in one orientation,\nthen roll 90 degrees and transmit in the other position.\n\nDuring\n\nthe test periods, all ground stations will record output from\nthe primary HF receivers with horizontally polarized antennas\nand also from the backup HF receivers with vertically polarized\nantennas.\n\nGround stations will make no reply or acknowledge-\n\nment during these\n\ntes~,\n\nbut a comparison of recorded signal\n\nstrengths will be analyzed after the flight to obtain the information on atmospheric effects and polarizations.\nGROUND LIGHT EXPERIMENT -- The ground light experiment\nshould provide data on approximately the minimum intensity for\na point-source ground light that is visible at spacecraft altitudes.\n\nThis information will indicate the feasibility of\n\n20\n- more -\n\n-25using ground or high altitude lights as navigation fixes for\nmid-course and near-Earth corrections in Project Apollo.\n\nIt\n\nis also designed to produce rough data on the light attenuation\nthrough the atmosphere.\nData from the experiment should be used in conjunction with\ndata from the window attenuation experiment to obtain accurate\nresults.\n\nThe pilot needs only the extinction photometer and\n\nstandard light source in the spacecraft.\n\nA high intenSity xenon\n\nlight will be located at Bloemfontein in the Republic of South\nAfrica.\n\nThe three million-candlepower light will be illuminated\n\ncontinuously for three minutes when the spacecraft is within\nrange on the sixth or 21st orbits.\n\nThe spacecraft will be\n\noriented to observe the light on only one occasion; this will\ndepend on best weather conditions over Bloemfontein for one\nof the two possible times.\nData from this test will consist of the pilot\'s time\ncomments and photometer readings.\n\nBefore and during the\n\nmarks~\nmission~\n\nthe pilot will be given the required pitch and yaw attitudes to\nput the

experiment is to obtain data for an evaluation of the transmission of light through the spacecraft window.\nAn extinction photometer (a neutral density, optical wedge)\nand a calibrated standard light source will be used in this experiment.\n\nThe readings are to be obtained at opportune moments\n\nfor the pilot and whenever identifiable stars are in view during either the daylight or night phase.\n\nReading the light level\n\nof th e standard source before and after the star readings provides a measure of light unrestricted by the window and also\nestablishes the degree of the pilot\'s

sight undergoes\na variation in angle of incidence for different positions on\nthe window.\nDuring times when higher priority work is not in progress,\nthe pilot will attempt to locate stars that he can positively\nidentify and that will remain in the field of view for several\nminutes.\n\nThe night phase of the seventh orbit may provide an\n\n28\n- more -\n\n-27ideal opportunity for this

standard light source several times\nuntil repeatable readings are achieved.\n\nThe same procedure\n\nwill be used on a known star until repeatability is again\nachieved.\n\nThe approximate location of the star in the window\n\nand estimates of\n\nextraneous or internally reflected li ghting\n\nwill also be noted.\n\nThe standard source will be occluded imme-\n\ndiately after the

MA-9 SPACECRAFT\nThe MA-9 spacecraft, listed as No. 20 in engineering\ndocuments, has been named "Faith 7" by Astronaut Cooper.\nThe pilot says he picked this name for three reasons:\n(1) It embodies his faith in terms of his belief in God\nand country; (2) It describes the loyalty he and his\nfellow workers feel toward the organization and their\nbelief in the manned space effort, and (3) It embodies\nthe confidence that binds together the team making our\nmanned space flights possible.\n\nThe\n\n"7", of course,\n\nstands for the original seven astronauts.\nThe spacecraft stands nine and one-half feet tall and\nnleasures six feet across the base.\n\nSpacecraft weight at\n\nlaunch will be about 4,000 pounds.\n\nWeight in orbit will\n\nbe about 3,000 pounds, and flotation weight after a normal\nflight should be approximately 2,400 pounds.\nThe spacecraft is equipped with a large observation\nwindow and an explosive-opened egress hatch.\nThe prime contractor for the Mercury spacecraft is\nthe McDonnell Aircraft Corporation of st. Louis, Missouri.\n\n31\n-more-\n\n-30FUEL SUPPLY AND USAGE -- The rate of usage of hydrogen\nperoxide for the Reaction and Control System (RCS) is a\ncritical item in accomplishing a mission of up to 22 orbits.\nFuel usage rates are determined basically by the mode used\nin controlling the attitude of the spacecraft\n\n0\n\nManual\n\ncontrol uses fuel in greater quantities than the automatic\n(ASCS) or fly-by-wire (FBW) systems because the manual\ncontrol systems use the larger thrusters.\n\nIn terms of\n\nfuel economy, past flight experience indicates that the\nASCS mode is the most economical of the three control modes,\nand the manual proportional mode is the most expensive.\nHowever, for a mission of up to 22 orbits, the major\npart of the orbital time will include "drifting flight ll\n\n--\n\nnone of the attitude control modes will be used, thereby\nsaving the hydrogen peroxide until preCise attitude becomes\nnecessary.\n\nFor this misSion, an additi onal 10 pounds of\n\nfue l have be en added, bringing t he total fuel weight to\n\n66 pounds.\n\nA total of 24 pounds of manual control fuel\n\nand 42 pounds of automatic mode fuel is available.\n\nFuel\n\nis contained in three bladders inside three fuel tanks which can be interconnected - and is forced out by nitrogen\npressurization.\n\n32\n-ffiore-\n\n-31TAPE RECORDER PROGRAMMING -- The spacecraft tape\nrecorder will run continuously from umbilical separation\nuntil spacecraft separation plus five minutes; from this\npoint until retrograde minus 30 seconds, the tape recorder\nis programmed to record one minute of data for every ten\nminutes of elapsed time.\n\nThe pilot can switch to contin-\n\nuous recorder operation at any time.\n\nThe astronaut\'s\n\nvoice will alway s appear on the tape recording in either\nthe continuous, programed or VOX operation mode.\n\nAfter\n\nretrograde plus 30 seconds, the recorder will operate\ncontinuously until impact plus ten minutes.\nMAIN BATTERY SYSTEM -- One 1,500 watt-hour battery\nand five 3,000 watt-hour batteries are provided and can\nbe interconnected in various ways to provide power for\nthe complete mission and a post-landing period.\n\nAs part\n\nof a "single point failure" analysis, the MA-9 spacecraft\ntelemetry system has been redesigned to utilize two power\nsupplies.\n\nAn isolated backup power system consisting of\n\nthe 1500-vatt-hour battery\n\nis used for critical items\n\nand can be initiated by a pilot-operated switch.\n\nTo\n\nfurther insure reliable operation of the pyrotechnic system,\neach device has a completely isolated power feed system.\nFor this mission, two 1500- watt-hour batteries used in\nprevious missions have been uprated to 3000-watt-hour\ncapacity.\n\n33\n-more-\n\n685583 0 - 63 - 3\n\n_J\n\n- 32 -\n\nALTIMETER--The Mercury barometric altimeter is a singlerevolution indicator with a range from sea level to 100,000\nfeet.\n\nThe dial face has reference marks at the drogue and\n\nmain parachute deployment altitudes, normally 21,000 feet and\n10,000 feet, respectively.\n\nENVIRONMENTAL DISPLAYS--At the top right corner of the\nmain panel are located environmental displays, providing the\npilot with indications of cabin pressure, temperature, humidity, and oxygen quantity remaining.\n\nFOOD AND WATER STORAGE--The primary drinking water supply\nwill contain four pounds of water, and the survival kit will\ncarry another six pounds for a total of ten pounds.\n\nIn addi-\n\ntion, condensate water will be collected and stored by the\npilot in drinking water containers--one-pound polyethlyne bags-containing halid tablets.\n\nCLOCK AND RETRO-FIRE TlMER--The main clock in the MA-9\nspacecraft has three major separate operational components:\n(1)\n\na standard aircraft elapsed time clock,\n\n(2) an "elapsed\n\ntime after launch" digital indicqtor with a manual reset, and\n(3) a resettable timer and time-delay relay which will initiate\n\n- 33 -\n\nthe retro-grade fire sequence.\n\nWhen the preset time has passed,\n\nthe relay closes and actuates the retrograde fire signal, at the\nsame time sending a telemetered signal to the ground.\n\nThere al-\n\nso is a back-up clock.\n\nUMBILICAL DOOR--A spring-loaded mechanism will be utilized\nfor the closing of the spacecraft umbilical door.\n\nA green tele-\n\nlight will indicate the closing of the door, while a red light\nwill indicate to the pilot when the door is open; both lights\nare monitored via telemetry.\n\nSURVIVAL EQUIPMENT--The survival package consists of a\none-man liferaft, a desalting kit, shark repellant, dye markers,\nfirst aid kit, distress signals, a signal mirror, portable radio beacon, a water container with an explusion-type drinking\ntube, survival rations, matches, a whistle, ten feet of nylon\ncord and a hand-held transceiver which will provide communications capability.\n\nA lightweight, radar-reflective liferaft is fabricated of\nMylar (for air retention) and nylon (for strength).\n\nThe three-\n\npound four-ounce raft features three water ballast buckets for\nflotation stability and a deflatable boarding end which may be\nreinflated by an oral inflation tube following boarding.\n\nThe\n\nraft is international orange.\n\nJ\n\n- 34 -\n\nPILOT\'S DESK--The MA-9 spacecraft cabin is equipped with\nwork table assembly located in front of the main panel pedestal for work and storage space.\n\nPILOT\'S MAP--A small cardboard diagram of the MA-9 flight\npath with recovery force locations is contained within the pilot\'s desk until ready for use.\n\nLast minute, prelaunch in-\n\nformation on cloud formations and weather phenomena will be\nmarked by Mercury weather experts.\n\nHATCH--The MA-9 spacecraft is equipped with an explosive\nactuated hatch just as a pilot\'s canopy is secured in high performance aircraft.\n\nThe astronaut can jettison the hatch by\n\npushing a plunger button inside the spacecraft or by pulling\na cable.\n\nThe explosive charge for the hatch was added as an\n\nadditional pilot safety device to insure easy and rapid escape\nif necessary.\n\nThe hatch may also be removed from the outside\n\nby recovery teams.\n\n- 35 -\n\n5.\n\nENVIRONMENTAL CONTROL SYSTEM\n\nThe environmental control system (ECS) will provide the\nMA-9 spacecraft cabin and astronaut\'s pressure suit with a\n100 per cent oxygen environment and pressurization for comfort and safety.\n\nThe ECS is completely automatic; however,\n\nin the event of control failure, emergency controls are provided for use.\n\nRequirements for ECS are to (1) provide breathing oxygen\nfor extended orbital flight,\nlation;\n\n(2) provide adequate body venti-\n\n(3) remove metabolic products,\n\n(4) control cabin tem-\n\nperature within comfortable and safe limits during all phases\nof the flight,\n\n(5) provide cabin and/or suit pressurization in\n\nvarious modes of operation,\n\n(6) operate in a zero g condition\n\nand in high g acceleration, and (7) function automatically and\nmanually.\n\nOne additional 7,500 psi oxygen tank is carried aboard\nthe spacecraft; it is in parallel with the primary oxygen\nbottle.\n\nThe addition amounts to about 50% more oxygen than\n\ncarried in the MA-8 mission.\n\n3(\n\n1\'"\'1\n\nJ\n\n- 36 -\n\nSmaller suit and cabin freon orifices will provide better\nbalance of ground freon cooling to both the suit and cabin heat\nexchangers.\n\nCarbon dioxide absorption capacity has been increased with\nan additional one pound of lithium hydroxide.\n\nREMOVED--Items removed as unnecessary for this flight include the periscope (75 pounds including associated ballast),\na backup telemetry recorder, a high frequency telemetry transmitter, and the Rate Stabilization Control System.\n\nCYLINDRICAL NECK CONTENTS--Above the astronaut\'s cabin,\nthe cylindrical neck section contains the main and reserve parachute system.\n\nThese parachutes are installed in the spacecraft.\n\nThe\n\ndrogue chute has a six-foot-diameter, conical, ribbon-type canopy with approximately six-foot-long ribbon suspension lines,\nand a 30-foot-long riser made of Dacron to minimize elasticity\neffects during deployment of the drogue at an altitude of 21 1 000\nfeet.\n\nThe drogue riser is permanently attached to the space-\n\ncraft antenna by a three point suspension system terminating at\nthe antenna in three steel cables which are insulated in areas\nexposed to heat.\n\n38\n\n-\n\n37 -\n\nThe drogue parachute is packed in a protective bag and\nstowed in the drogue mortar tube on top of a light-weight sabot or plug.\n\nThe sabot functions as a free piston to eject\n\nthe parachute pack when pressured from below by gases generated by a pyrotechnic charge.\n\nThe function of the drogue chute is to provide a backup\nstabilization device for the spacecraft in the event of failure of the control and stabilization system.\n\nThe reserve chute is identical to the main chute.\n\nIt is\n\ndeployed by a flat circular-type pilot chute.\n\nOther components of the landing system include mortar and\ncartridge, barostats, antenna fairing ejector, and a sea marker\np~k~.\n\nFollowing escape tower separation in flight, the 21,000\nand 10,000 foot barostats are armedo\n\nNo further action occurs\n\nuntil spacecraft descent causes the 21,000 foot barostat to\nclose, activating the drogue ejection system.\n\nTwo seconds after the 10,000 foot barostat closes, power\nis supplied to the antenna fairing ejector--1ocated above the\ncylindrical neck section--to deploy the main landing parachute\n\n39\n\n- 38 -\n\nand an underwater charge, which is dropped to provide an audible sound landing point indication.\nSARAH radio then begins transmitting.\n\nThe ultra-high frequency\nA can of sea-marker dye\n\nis deployed with the reserve chute and remains attached to the\nspacecraft by a lanyard.\n\nOn landing, an impact switch jettisons the landing parachute and initiates the remaining location and recovery aids.\nThis includes release of sea-marker dye with the reserve chute\nif it has not previously been deployed, triggering a high-intensity flashing light, extension of a l6-foot whip antenna\nand initiation of the operation of a high-frequency radio beacon.\nIf the spacecraft should spring a leak or if the life\nsupport system should become fouled after landing, the astronaut can "escape through this upper neck section or through the\nside hatch.\n\nIMPACT SKIRT--Following deployment of the main landing\nparachute, the heat shield is released, extending the landingimpact bag to form a pneumatic cushion primarily for impact\non land.\n\nIt is also required for spacecraft stability after\n\nwater landing.\n\n40\n\n-\n\n39 -\n\nThe air cushion is formed by a four-foot skirt of rubberized fiberglass that connects the heat shield and the rest of\nthe spacecraft.\n\nAfter the main chute is deployed, the heat\n\nshield will be released from the spacecraft and the bag will\nfill with air.\n\nUpon impact, air trapped between the heat\n\nshield and the spacecraft will be vented through holes in the\nskirt as well as portions of the spacecraft which are not completely air tight, thereby providing the desired cushioning\neffect.\n\n41\n\n- 40 -\n\n6.\n\nSPACECRAFT LOCATION AIDS\n\nELECTRONICS AIDS -- (1) A super SARAH beacon will be\nactivated during main chute deployment at 10,000 feet altitude;\n(2) A SARAH beacon will be activated at the same time as the\nSuper SARAH;

LOW-RESIDUE DIET\nThe low-pesidue diet for the MA-9 pilot is tasty and palatable.\n\nIt contains a great deal of protein, and if the\n\nastro~\n\nnaut loses weight it will be because of his strenuous and\nenergy-consuming activity.\nConsumption of the low-residue diet is required to begin\n\n96 hours prior to the mission.\n\nThe basis of the diet is meat,\n\nrice, eggs, sugar, small amounts of fruit juices, and tea\nand coffee.\n\nThe menu will vary, changing during the final\n\n24 hours before lift-off_\nfood.)\n\n(See section #3 for in-flight\n\n41\')\n,)\n-more-\n\n_\n\n8.\n\nL~ 2 _\n\nPILOT COMM\nUNICATIONS\n\nThe IVIA-9 pilot may remain in touch with ground control\nthrough the use of high-frequency (HF) and ultra-high -frequency\n(UHF) radios, C- and S-band radar beacons, and -- if the situation dictates\n\na command receiver and/or a telegraphy-type\n\ncode key.\nThe mission pilot\'s\n\nc~pability\n\nto transmit on HF begins\n\nwhen the spacecraft separates from the launch vehicle,\nterminates after reentry when the main parachute is deployed,\nand is again resumed after spacecraft landing when the 16foot HF antenna is erected.\n\n(A timer will erect the antenna\n\nwithin a maximum of ten and one-half minutes after spacecraft\nlanding. )\nThe astronaut\'s capability to transmit and receive on UHF\nexists from launch until approximately 24 hours after impact.\nVoice relay aircraft will be airborne in the vicinity\nof recovery areas 180 miles east of Bermuda and 125 miles\nsoutheast of Midway island where no communications ships or\ntracking stations are located.\n\nThese aircraft will be on\n\nstation to relay automatically voice communications\n\nbetween\n\nthe spacecraft and Mercury Control Center.\nTelemetry transmitters and the C- and S-Band beacons will\nbe turned off during the major part of some orbits, when the\ncraft is not within communications range of a tracking station.\nThese transmitters and beacons can then be turned on at the\nproper time by ground command when within proper range.\n\n4--1\n\n-more-\n\n- 43 -\n\nIn conjunction with the numerous out-of-communications\nareas, more dependence has been placed upon the mission pilot\nto monitor spacecraft systems during this flight.\nalso be the procedure for future missions.\n\n40\n\nThis will\n\n- 44 9.\n\nMA-9 LAUNCH VEHICLE\n\nThe launch vehicle for the MA-9 mission will be the Atlas\n130-D, built by General Dynamics/Astronautics of San Diego, California, under united States Air Force direction.\n\nThe 6555th\n\nAerospace Test Wing, USAF, assisted by GDA and the Aerospace\nCorporation, is responsible for checkout, technical readiness,\nand launch of the vehicle.\n\nPREFLIGHT TESTING--The Atlas 130-D arrived at Cape Canaveral on March 18, 1963, aboard an Air Force C-133B transport\naircraft and was delivered to the hangar area and transferred\nto its R&D handling trailer for inspection prior to official\nacceptance from the contractor.\n\nCertain components of the flight control system, propellant utilization system, and the batteries were removed from\nthe vehicle and rechecked for verification of their flightreadiness condition.\n\nThese tests were performed in the pro-\n\npellant utilization laboratory located in Hanger "H" and in\nthe Gyro and Battery Laboratories located in Hangar "J."\n\nAt-\n\nlas 130-D was then transported to Mercury-Atlas Complex No.\n14 and raised to launch position on March 22.\n\n48\n\n- 45 -\n\nThe MA-9 launch vehicle received a flight acceptance composite test to deteonine systems and components readiness for\nflight.\n\nThis test involved thorough checkout for lack of in-\n\nterference among the vehicle\'s airborne systems while on internal power.\n\nThe autopilot-guidance loop was also checked for\n\nverification of proper operation.\n\nThe operation of Atlas py-\n\nrotechnics--the destruct package and explosive bolts--was then\nsimulated.\n\nThis flight acceptance composite test for the MercuryAtlas was performed with the Atlas and Mercury spacecraft as\nclose to flight configuration as feasible with the exception\nthat pyrotechnics and propellants were not aboard.\n\nThe com-\n\npatibility of all Atlas and Mercury systems was checked to\ninsure that the radio-frequency (R-F) of the spacecraft-launch\nvehicle was compatible with the Cape R-F ,-for insurance that\nR-F outputs from both the Mercury and the Atlas will not cause\nignition of the pyrotechnics.\n\nChecks of launch vehicle air-\n\nborne systems for interference were performed again with the\nlaunch vehicle on internal power and with umbilicals disconnected but with spacecraft umbilicals connected.\n\n4\n\n- 46 -\n\n10. MERCURY-ATLAS COUNTDOWN\n\nOPERATION--The Atlas 130-D is equipped with baffle injection engines; it requires a hypergolic (self-igniting) start.\nAll five engines are ignited at the time of launch--the sustainer (60,000 pounds thrust), the two booster engines (150,000\npounds thrust each), which are outboard of the sustainer at the\nbase of the vehicle, and two small vernier engines used for minor course corrections during powered flight.\n\nDuring the first minute of flight, these Atlas engines\nconsume more fuel than a commercial jet airliner during a transcontinental trip.\n\nMercury-Atlas Countdown Highlights are as follows:\n\nT-one day \xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2 Fuel aboard Atlas and spacecraft check and servicing\nT-390 Counting (Launch day)\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2 Atlas countdown begins\n\nT-165 Holding \xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2 Preflight evaluation for one\nhour\nT-120 Counting \xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2 Astronaut enters spacecraft\nT-I05 Counting \xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2 Hatch installed on spacecraft\nT-65 Holding \xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2 Preflight evaluation for 30\nminutes\nT-50 Counting \xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2 Service tower removed\n\n48\n\n- 47 -\n\nT-35 Counting\n\n..................

Tracking Range\non a heading of about 73 degrees -- just north of east from Cape\nCanaveral.\n\nClimbing slowly at first, the Atlas will accelerate\n\nfaster as it gains momentum and as its propellant load is burned.\nA roll program (32.46 degrees counterclockwise), which\nestablishes the correct flight azimuth, is initiated two seconds\nafter lift-off and terminated at launch plus 15 seconds.\npitch program is initiated at this point and\n\nThe\n\ncontinued at al-\n\nmost a constant rate until sustainer/vernier cutoff, guiding the\nAtlas in an arc to its orbital path.\nAt staging -- about two minutes after lift-off when the\nvehicle reaches about 40 miles in altitude and a range of about\n45 miles from the Cape -- the two booster engines are shut down\nand jettisoned.\n\nThe sustainer and vernier engines continue to\n\naccelerate the vehicle.\nDuring the first two and one-half minutes of flight, the\nASIS (Abort Sensing I mplementation System named above) vlill be\ncapable of sensing impending trouble in the Atlas and of triggering the escape rocket.\n\nThe MA-9 pilot will also be able to\n\ntrigger the escape system to pull his spacecraft from the launch\nvehicle.\n\n50\n- more -\n\n-49About 20 seconds after staging\n\nassuming the flight pro-\n\nceeds as planned -- the 16-foot escape-rocket motor will fire\nto jettison the tower from the spacecraft.\nsystem is then armed for use after reentry.\n\nThe parachute landing\nThe Mercury-Atlas\n\ncombination will continue to accelerate toward the insertion\npoint.\nAfter staging and until orbital insertion, the ASIS will\ncontinue to "watch" for trouble.\n\nIf significant deviation oc-\n\ncurs, the system will automatically initiate action for releasing the spacecraft-to-Atlas clamp ring and for firing the posigrade rockets on the base of the spacecraft.\nAbout five minutes after lift-off, guidance ground command\nwill shut down the sustainer and vernier enginesj this will\noccur at the orbital insertion point.\nORBITAL INSERTION -- The Atlas will arrive at its insertion point traveling approximately 17,500 miles per hour (25,700\nfeet per second).\n\nSustainer and vernier engine s will be shut\n\ndown simultaneously at the instant the Atlas hits this insertion point.\n\nAbout one second later, the spacecraft-to-Atlas\n\nclamp ring will be released automatically and the posigrade rockets will be fired to separate the orbital spacecraft from the\nspent Atlas.\n\nThe three posigrades will give the spacecraft a\n\n51\n- more -\n\nL.. _ _\n\n-50small increment of additional velocity (about\n\n24 feet per\n\ns e cond) to assure against the bumping of the two vehicles later\nin flight.\nThe orbital path achieved for the spacecraft by the Atlas\nwi ll be the result of split-second programing of launch vehicle\nstaging, velocity, pitch-over, yaw control and engine cutoff.\nThe Atlas will accelerate continuously during its powered flight\nand must arrive at the insertion point traveling at a precise\nspeed, completing its pitchover to an Earth-referenced horizontal\nfli ght path at the same moment it reaches that orbital point.\n12.\n\nEVENTS DURING

Mercury spacecraft will undergo a few seconds of automatic\ndamping (removal of any attitude changing motions) and will\n\n52\n- more -\n\n-51turn around 180 degrees so that the blunt face of the craft\nturns forward and upward -- 34 degrees above the horizontal.\nFrom that point on during orbital flight, the pilot will control the spacecraft\n\nin attitude by automatic or manual control\n\nor will shut down controls and allow the craft to drift without\nattitude corrections.\nThe Mercury spacecraft will be inserted into orbit in the\nvicinity of Bermuda.\n\nThe craft will by then have attained an\n\naltitude of approximately 100 miles and a speed of about 17,500\nmiles per hour.\n\nAt engine cutoff, the craft will have been\n\nsubjected to more than seven and one-half g -- about the same g\nas will be produced by reentry.\nThe Mercury craft will reach an apogee of about 170 statute\nmiles off the W st Coast of Australia and a perigee of about 100\ne\nmiles at the insertion point over Bermuda.\nREENTRY -- As the MA-9 spacecraft hurtles around Earth\non its final orbit -- twenty-second orbit -- it will approach\na point some 170 miles southeast of Kyushu, Japan, near the\nPacific Command Ship.\n\nAt this point, the retrorockets will\n\nfire to initiate reentry.\n\n(The command ship, located some 275\n\nmiles south of Japan, has the capability of firing the retrorockets\nif necessary.)\n\nThe automatic attitude control system will hold\n\nthe spacecraft in proper attitude during the braking maneuver.\n\n53\n- more -\n\n-52In the event of reentry from orbit on one of the Atlantic landing passes, the retros will fire as the spacecraft approaches\nthe West Coast of the United States.\nShortly after retrofire, the exhausted retropack will\njettison and the spacecraft will automatically assume reentry\nattitude.\n\nThe Mercury will begin to encounter more dense at-\n\nmosphere of Earth at an altitude of about 55 miles.\n\nAt this\n\npoint, temperatures will start mounting on the spacecraft\'s\nablation heat shield.\n\nOn a nominal mission, peak reentry tem-\n\nperature of about 3,000 degrees F. will occur at an altitude\nof about 25 statute miles while the spacecraft still moves at\nnearly 15,000 mph.\n\nAll told, the vehicle will sustain tempera-\n\ntures in this neighborhood for about two minutes.\n\nAlmost co-\n\nincident with the heat pulse will be a dramatic reduction in\nspacecraft speed.\n\nBetween 55 and 12 miles altitude -- covering\n\na slant distance of about 760 miles -- spacecraft speed should\nbe reduced from 17,500 mph down to 270 mph in a little over five\nminutes.\nAt about 21,000 feet, the six-foot-diameter drogue chute\nwill deploy automatically to stabilize the spacecraft.\n\nThe\n\npilot may elect to deploy the chute manually, however, as high\nas 40,000 feet.\n\nAt about 10, 000 feet, the antenna fairing above\n\nthe spacecraft cylindrical section will jettison and the 63foot ringsail-type main landing parachute will deploy.\nimpact bag will also deploy, the\n- more -\n\n51\n\nThe\n\n-53SARAH and Super SARAH are activated, and the SOFAR (underwater\ndepth charge)is released.\nAt impact, the main parachute and reserve chute will jettison.\nOnboard electrical equipment will then shut down, and additional\nlocation aids -- dye marker, seasave beacon, and flashing light,\nwill become activated.\n14.\n\nOPTICAL TRACKING OF MA-9 LAUNCH\n\nOptical tracking of the MA-9 combination will be part of\nthe total launch instrumentation.\n\nHistorical documentation and\n\nengineering camera coverage remains necessary for analyzing\nflight test results.\n\nThese camera observations will be used in\n\nconjunction with data from other instrumentation for establishing launch records.\nThis launch will be made into clear skies, since clouds\nrestrict photographic activity above the cover and since optical\ntracking is such an integral part of each test.\nEngineering data from optical tracking cameras on the ground\nhave been a major asset in launch vehicle and spacecraft research.\nThese data have often provided the only source for establishing accuracy of trajectory or malfunction reasons -- just where\nthe vehicle bent, broke, or caught fire -- for research vehicles.\n- more 5\n-\n\n-54The need for tracking optics, as used for very early missiles\nand rockets launch from the Cape, was included as a launch\nvehicle requirement during early planning stages of Project\nMercury.\nTypes of cameras used will be:\n(1)\n\nMetric (Measurement) Optics -- This type of camera\n\ncoverage permits accurate determination of trajectory parameters\n(position, velocity, acceleration, attitude, etc.).\n(2)\n\nEngineering Se quential Optics -- This coverage is\n\nprovided by fixed and by long focal length cameras (tracking\ntelescopes).\n\nDetails and times of events are obtained in this\n\nmanner as well as by onboard instrumentation.\n\nThese data enabl e\n\nNASA scientists to pinpoint where and at what time events happened; they can later be watched in slow motion for detailed\nobservation of powered flight details.\n\nThey also serve as back-\n\nup for onboard telemetry.\n(3)\n\nDocumentary Optics -- This coverage provides historical\n\ndocumentation of spacecraft and launch vehicle during powered\nflight.\nThe above cameras are located around the launch pad and\nacross Cape Canaveral.\n\nLong range tracking cameras are spotted\n\nalong the Florida Coast to about four miles north of the launch\narea and some 40 miles south.\nthese areas for launch.\n\nClear skies are necessary over\n\n5G\n- more -\n\n-55The areas and cameras along the Florida Coast include\nthe following:\n\nFalse Cape, ISO-inch IGOR (Intermediate Ground\n\nOptical Rocorder) and a Theodolytej Williams Point, a 35 mm\nROTI (Recording Optical Tracking Instrument); Cocoa Beach, a\n360-inch IGORj Melbourne Beach, a 500-inch ROTI; Vera Beach,\na 500-inch ROTIj and Patrick AFB, a 360- inch IGOR and a Theodolyte.\nThe rGOR is a $192,000 instrument including an astrodome\nand resembling a small observatory.\n\nThe ROTI, also with an\n\nastrodome, costs $580,000 and requires up to three men for\noperation.\n\nThe Theodylyte, basically a stand, is priced at\n\n$75,000 and requires two operators.\nCameramen will receive instructions from NASA scientists\nand engineersj their job then will be to return the requested\nmaterial after a launch.- Film is 35 mm and 70 mm with black\nand white or color film.\n\nPhotographs from these cameras have\n\nincluded events from as high as escape tower jettison altitude\nof about 50 miles.\nThis optical tracking system is planned for future tests\nof Titan II for Project Gemini research and for Project Apollo\nlaunch phases.\n\nNew developments will be incorporated into the\n\noperation as needed.\n\n57\n\n-5615.\n\nTHE TRACKING NETWORK\n\nWorldwide Mercury Tracking Stations, including 19 land\nstations and four ships at sea, will monitor the MA-9 flight.\nThe Space Computing Center of the NASA Goddard Space Flight\nCenter in Greenbelt, Maryland, will make trajectory computations.\n\n(Trajectory computations for Gemini-Titan and Apollo-\n\nSaturn programs will be made at the under-construction Mission\nControl Center of the NASA Manned Spacecraft Center, Houston,\nTexas.)\nDuring the MA-9 flight, information will pour into the\nGoddard Space Computing Center from tracking and ground instrumentation points around the globe at a rate, in some cases,\nof more than 1,000 bits per second.\n\nUpon almost instantaneous\n\nanalysis, the information will be relayed to the Cape for action.\nTracking sites linked across the Atlantic Ocean are:\n\nCape\n\nCanaveral, Grand Bahama Island, Grand Turk Island, Antigua,\nAscension Island, East Island (Puerto Rico), Bermuda and Grand\nCanary Island.\nOther stations on around the world are Kano, \'Nigeria;\nZanzibar; Muchea and Woomera (Woomera will operate on radar\nonly for the MA-9 flight), Australia; Canton Island; Hawaii;\nand Guaymas, Mexico.\n\n58\n-more-\n\n-57Stations in the United States--in addition to the Cape-are at Pt. Arguello in Southern California; White Sands Missile\nRange, New Mexico; Corpus Christi, Texas; and Eglin Air Force\nBase, Florida.\nThe Pacific Command Ship, Coastal Sentry Quebec, will be\nstationed about 275 miles south of Japan, while the Rose Knot\nVictor will be in position just north of the intersection of\norbits nine and twelve in the South Pacific about 3,000 miles\noff the coast of Chile.\n\n16.\n\nTRACKING AIRCRAFT\n\nIt is planned t h at v o ice r e lay and ra d ar t ra ckin g air c raft\nwill\n\n~.)e\n\nused to i.: r2 ,;L t h e\n\nIf.LA- ~\n\nspacecraft during the reent.ry\n\nand postlanCiing phas e of the mission.\n\nTWo C-band radar track-\n\ning ships--the Twin Falls victory, 400 miles east of Cape\nCanaveral, and the Range Tracker, 800 miles north of Wake\nIsland in the Pacific--will also be on station for radar\ncoverage of reentry.\n\nIn addition to using their capability\n\nof locating the spacecraft, NASA will evaluate their tracking\nand location capability with respect to future Gemini-Titan\nand Apollo-Saturn missions.\n17.\n\nRECOVERY RESPONSIBILITIES\n\nThe prime responsibilities of the recovery forces in\nsupport of the MA-9 mission are as follows:\n-more5 9\n\n-58-\n\n(1) Rapid location of the astronaut and spacecraft after impact,\n(2) safe retrieval of the astronaut, and (3) collection, preservation, and rapid transmittal of test data and test hardware\nback to Cape Canaveral.\n18.\n\nRECOVERY AREAS\n\nRe \':::ove r y areas f or orbits one, two, 16 and 17 lie about\n180 miles east of Bermuda.\n\nIf the mission terminates after\n\norbits three or 18, the spacec ra ft wil l land about 360 miles\nnortheast of Cape Canaveral.\n\nAfter orbits four, seven, and\n\n22, the craft will impact some 125 miles southeast of Midway\nIsland (about 900 miles northwest of Honolulu).\n\nThe recovery\n\narea for orbits five, six, 20 and 21 is planned at about 250\nmiles north-northeast of Midway.\n\nOrbit eight ends some 800\n\nmiles east-southeast of Honolulu, while the ninth orbit terminates about 250 miles south of Japan, the tenth nearly 180\nmiles east of Guiuan in the Philippines, the 13th almost 270\nmiles southwest of Grand Canary, the 14th some 680 miles\nnorthwest of the Canaries, and the 15th a little over 1,300\nmiles east of Bermuda (midway between Bermuda and Grand\nCanary).\n\nDue to low-probability areas along the 12th and 19th\n\norbits, any landing on these orbits will be a contingency\nlanding.\n\n60\n-more-\n\n-59-\n\nExtending the upcoming mission to 22 orbits necessitates\nthe establishment of the MA-9 primary recovery area to the\nPacific Ocean--as listed above--about 80 miles southeast of\nMidway Island.\n\nHowever, with the possibility that the mission\n\ncould be terminated prior to the 22nd orbit, deployment of\nrecovery vehicles to primary and contingency recovery areas\nin the Atlantic and Pacific remains necessary.\n\nTwelve ships\n\n(ten destroyers, one aircraft carrier and one oiler) are\nbeing deployed to the Atlantic under Rear Admiral Harold Bowen,\nCommander, Destroyer Flotilla Four, and Commander, Task Force\n\n140.\n\nIn the Pacific, 10 ships (nine destroyers and one carrier)\n\nare being sent out under Rear Admiral C. A. Buchanan, Commander,\nTask Force 130.\nIn addition, more than 100 aircraft around the world\ncould be called into action in the event of an emergency\nlanding of the MA-9 spacecraft.\nLANDING AREAS -- Planned landing areas are defined as\nareas in which a "short-time" recovery capability should be\nprovided.\n\nLocation and retrieval vehicles must be on station\n\nin planned landing areas to assure retrieval of the astronaut\nand spacecraft within a specified period of time.\nContingency landing areas are those defined as areas\nalong the orbital track--aside from the above described\n-more-61\n\n-60-\n\nplanned landing areas--in which the spacecraft could land\nfollowing some component or system failure.\nThe basic philosophy of recovery for MA-9 is to provide\nretrieval capability for:\n(1) Landings occurring in the event of an abort during\nthe powered phase of flight (planned landing areas).\n(2) Periodical landings from orbital flight (planned\nlanding areas).\n(3) Landing as a result of extreme emergency during\norbital flight (contingency landing areas).\nThe flight time interva l between planned landing areas\nhas been chosen after \xc2\xb7 ::onsiceration c)f sp2.2ec ra ft , network,\n.\nand r ecovery factors.\n\nThe se lection\n\no~\n\nlanding areas at\n\nspa ~ e-\n\ncraft ground track intersections permits recovery units assigned\nto one landing area to move about and provide a recovery capability in as many as three other landing areas.\n\nThe boundaries\n\nof these landing areas have been established by probability\nconsiderations of such factors as spacecraft control, retrofiresystem accuracy, and aerodynamic dispersion effects.\nPLANNED LANDING AREAS -- The first planned landing area\nis the launch site area, an abort landing area which is considered separately because of the special problems introduced\n-more-\n\n62\n\n-61by the terrain and shallow water in the vicinity of Cape\nCanaveral.\n\nLandings will occur in this area following an\n\nabort initiated after the escape system has been armed and\nduring the first 72 seconds of powered flight.\n\nThis launch\n\nsite landing area is four nautical miles in radius, centered\non the launch pad and extending offshore 12 nautical miles to\nthe beginning of the next landing area, Area A.\n\nSpecial\n\nlaunch-site recovery forces have been assembled and trained\nto meet these requirements; a full deployment of these forces\nis required for MA-9.\nAREA A -- This area originates 12 nautical miles seaward\nof the launch pad and extends along the ground track for a\ndistance of about 610 nautical miles and 30 miles to either\nside of the ground track.\n\nA landing will occur in Area A\n\nif an abort is initiated after T plus 72 seconds and prior to\nabout T plus 1 75 seconds.\n\nThis time period includes the time\n\nat which booster engine staging occurs.\nAREA B -- This is essentially an extension of Area A\nand extends along the ground track a distance of 1,390 nautical miles and extends 15 miles to either side of the ground\ntrack.\n\nThis area will contain a landing which could occur\n\nas a result of an abort initiated after T plus 175 seconds\nbut prior to T plus 298 seconds.\n-more-\n\n63\n\n-62AREAS C, D, E, and F -- These areas also have their major\naxes oriented along the ground track.\n\nShould an abort become\n\nnecessary during the final portion of powered flight, or\nduring the period shortly before insertion of the spacecraft\ninto orbit, an attempt will be made to land in one of these\nareas by proper retrofire timing.\nREMAINING AREAS -- In the planned landing areas along\nthe ground track, detailed ship positioning is based on probability considerations within a given area in order to minimize\nactual access times in the majority of situations.\n\nThe prob-\n\nability associated with a planned landing area is reflected\nin the recommended minimum recovery force deployment within\nthese areas.\n\nLanding areas have been selected at spacecraft\n\nground track intersections to enable the same ships to provide\na recovery capability within the access time in more than one\nlanding area.\nThroughout the mission, flight progress will be continuously evaluated.\n\nIf it becomes necessary to terminate the\n\nflight before the end of the 22-orbit recovery area, flight\ncontrol procedure will be utilized to land the spacecraft in\nplanned areas, if at all possible.\n-more-\n\nl\n\n61\n\nPeriodically during the\n\n-63-\n\nmission,\n\n"Go, No-Go" decisions will be made to determine if\n\nthe flight should continue; therefore, a higher probability\nof landing is associated with certain landing areas immediately\nfollowing these decision points.\nCONTINGENCY LANDING AREAS\n\nAll landings in areas other\n\nthan planned landing areas are considereG as contingency landarea s .\n\nPreferred contingency areas have been established for\n\nemergencies where the MA-9 landing might be deferred long\nenough to reach a "more desirable" landing site, but which\ncannot be deferred until one of the planned landing areas can\nbe reached.\n\nPrincipal factors involved in the selection of\n\npreferred contingency landing areas are orbital flight time\nconsiderations, network support, and recovery factors.\n\nThe\n\nMercury Worldwide Tracking Network is prepared to select retrofire times for a landing in one of the preferred areas if conditions warrant.\nHowever, due to the remote possibility that a landing\nmight occur outside either a planned or contingency area,\nsmall\n\nu.s.\n\nand Australian teams are stationed along the orbital\n\ntrack around the globe to locate the astronaut and to recover\nhim.\n\nThese small units consist of rescue planes and crews\n\ncapable of homing in on electronic beacons housed within the\nspacecraft and the pararescue men who will jump from their\n-""\n\n-more- 6 ~\n685583 0 - 63- 5\n\n-64aircraft and aid the astronaut until a surface vessel arrives.\nThese rescue teams are equipped with auxiliary flotation\ncollars and frogman equipment which will enable them to\n"float" the astronaut and spacecraft for several days if\nnecessary.\nA total of 27 of these contingency recovery teams,\ndeployed around the world and connected with Mercury Control\nCenter at the Cape, provide an assurance that all precautions\nhave been taken to insure the safety of a downed Mercury pilot.\n\n19.\n\nMEDICAL OPERATIONS\n\nAs in the case of each previous Mercury flight requiring\nmedical support, an Operational Bioastronautic Group has been\nformed to support the MA-9 launch.\n\nThis group is made up of\n\n129 people including 69 from Air Force, 34 from Navy, 23 from\nArmy, one from the u.S. Public Health Service and two from the\nRoyal Australian Air Force.\n\nThey include 55 physicians in the\n\nrecovery force, 17 physicians monitoring aeromedical data and\n30 medical technicians at various posts.\nThe management element of this group is responsible to\nCol.
