These\nswitches are limited in that they can be stepped only\nthrough a predetermined cyclic sequence. Utility of a\ncommutator would be extended if the sequence could\nbe altered on the basis of some decision made at any\nstep within the sequence.\n\nThe solution:\nA novel current steering commutator capable of\nstepping to all possible locations from any location by\nappropriate control logic, and which is easily tailored\nto specific user requirements.\nHow it\'s done:\nThe novel current steering commutator is made\nby coupling a conventional steering switch and a\n(continued overleaf)\n\nThis document was prepared under the sponsorship of the National\nAeronautics and Space Administration.

Whereas the conventional steering\nswitch has one core at each output, the novel switch\nhas many. Each of these cores represents a step span\nthat results in a steered output at that path. The cores\nof the novel switch are arranged in a "matrix" and are\nlaced with wires from the conventional switch and the\ncontrol logic. The novel switch outputs are laced\nthrough the cores of the conventional switch in the\nnormal manner.\nA commutator is operated in the usual two phase\ncycle: Phase 1, the novel switch is pulsed and an output pulse appears. In the normal manner. a core in the\nconventional switch is set and the output pulse is\nutilized. Phase 2, the conventional switch is pulsed\nand external lines are pulsed in accordance with the\nrequired step span and direction. One core in the novel\nswitch is set and the output pulse is utilized. A sixstage commutator which illustrates the technique is\nshown schematically in the figure. It is capable of\n\nBrief 67-10410\t\n\nadvancing forward by one step or repeating a step\nupon command.\nNote:\nInquiries concerning this invention may be directed to:\nTechnology Utilization Officer\nJet Propulsion Laboratory\n4800 Oak Grove Drive\nPasadena, California 91103\nReference: B67-10410\nPatent status:\nThe invention is owned by NASA, and a patent\r\napplication has been filed.
