Flowfield solutions were obtained at Mach numbers 1.5, 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 27.5. Axisymmetric and 5, 10, and 20 degree angles of attack were considered across the Mach-number range, with the Mach 25 conditions taken to 90 degrees angle of attack and the Mach 27.5 cases taken to 60 degrees angle of attack. Detailed surface heat-transfer rates were computed at Mach 20 and 25, revealing that heating rates on the heat-shield shoulder ,can exceed the stagnation-point heating by 230 percent. Finite-rate chemistry solutions were performed above Mach 10, otherwise perfect gas computations were made. Drag, lift, and pitching moment coefficients are computed and details of a wake flow are presented. The effect of including the wake in the solution domain was investigated and base pressure corrections to forebody drag coefficients were numerically determined for the lower Mach numbers. Pitching moment comparisons are made with direct simulation Monte Carlo results in the more rarefied flow at the highest Mach numbers, showing agreement within two-percent. Thin-layer Navier-Stokes computations of the axial force are found to be 15 percent higher across the speed range than the empirical/Newtonian based results used during the initial trajectory analyses.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20040110822, "endDate": "1996-01-18T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Inst. of Aeronautics and Astronautics", "location": "Washington, DC, United States"}}, "meetingId": "9fc0d681e7344d0f82953cc5e52d0ab2", "id": "2018b13811214db7afaa9e33a9461952"}], "name": "34th Aerospace Sciences Meeting and Exhibit", "location": "Reno, NV", "id": "9fc0d681e7344d0f82953cc5e52d0ab2", "startDate": "1996-01-15T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20040110822, "id": "2d400089cdc94a84bd2b84dfbeabc5eb", "publicationDate": "1996-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20040110822.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20040110822/downloads/20040110822.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20040110822/downloads/20040110822.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20040110822/downloads/20040110822.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
