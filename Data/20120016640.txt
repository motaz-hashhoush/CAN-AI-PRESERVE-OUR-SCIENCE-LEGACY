b'Whole Module Offgas Test Report:\nSpace-Xl Dragon Module\n\nOn September 26 and September 28,2012 a chemist from the JSC Toxicology Group acquired\nsamples of air in 500 m1 evacuated canisters from the sealed Space-Xl Dragon Module. One sample was\nalso acquired from Space-X Facility near the module at the start of the test. Samples of the module air\nwere taken in triplicate once the module had been sealed, and then taken again in triplicate 1.98 days\nlater. Ofthe triplicate samples, the first served as a line purge, and the last two were analyzed. The results\nof 5 samples are reported in the tables. Table I lists the analytical concentrations. Table 2 gives the T\nvalues indexed against 7-day Spacecraft Maximum Allowable Concentrations (SMACs) and Table 2A\ngives T values indexed against 180-day SMACs. For purposes of the offgas test only the 7 day SMACs\nare relevant. The average recoveries of surrogate standards placed in the canisters to validate analytical\nintegrity were as follows: l3C-acetone, 10 1%; fluorobenzene, 102%; and chlorobenzene, 82%.\nAnalytical data contained in the Toxicology Group Report (attached) show that the ambient\nfacility air was relatively clean (0.02 T units). The high isopropanol levels found in background samples\nduring the previous test were not present in this test. Analyses of pairs of samples that were taken during\nthe test show excellent agreement between the pairs and a rate of increase of 0.32 T units per day when\ncorrected for the absence of33% of the mass of cargo during the test. The time-zero sample showed 0.07\nT units.\nIf the time from last purge of the module on the ground to crew first entry on orbit is 4 days as\nplanned, then the estimated T value at the time of first entry is 0.07 + (4 x 0.32) = 1.35 T units. The\nprimary contributors to the T value during the test were trimethylsilanol, acetaldehyde , and small\nalcohols. The Dragon heat-exchange compound, perfluoro (2-methyl) pentane, was initially detected at\n0.3 mg/m 3 but accumulated to a concentration of 540 mg/m 3 during the 2-day test. This means about 5.4 g\nleaked from the system into the ~ 10 M3 volume of the Dragon. The vibrations oflaunch could cause the\nleak rate to substantially increase, so this non-toxic compound could be present in large concentrations at\nfirst entry.\nIt is important to note that this test targets compounds characteristic of offgassing from materials.\nReactive compounds, such as propellants, cannot be detected by the standard offgas test method.\n\nC~~jJ? __lt2L2i\nNAS\n\nmes, PhD\nChief Toxicologist\n\nDate\n\n'
