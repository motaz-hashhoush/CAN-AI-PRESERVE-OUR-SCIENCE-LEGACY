Verification\nof the engineering systems and the safety of the\nworld\'s\nfirst\nreusable\nspacecraft\nwere tested during this period.\nThe\nSpace and Life Sciences Directorate\nat the Johnson Space Center supported\nOFT crews through extensive preflight, inflight and postflight\ntraining,and monitoringin a variety\nof specialized areas which will be\naddressedin this report. All of the\nOFT flights were made in the spacecraft Columbia and launched from the\nKennedy Space Center (KSC).\nColumbia\'s inaugural flight began on\nApril 12, 1981, at 7:00 A.M. Eastern\nStandard Time (EST). Since this was\nthe first time that an American\nspacecraft had been put into orbit\nwithout prior unmanned flight orbital\ntesting, the mission was conservatively planned in the interest of\nsafety. During the flight, a series\nof tests and checkouts were accomplished. After 2 days, 6 hours, 20\nminutes and 52 seconds, the Columbia\nlanded on runway 23 of Rogers Dry\nLake at Edwards Air Force Base in the\nMojave Desert of California. John W.\nYoung served as Commander and Robert\nL. Crippen was the Pilot.\nOn November 12, 1981, at 10:10 A.M.\nEST STS-2 was launched. The launch\nwas initially scheduled for November\n4, 1981; however, a hold at T-minus\n31 seconds for out-of-tolerance\nmeasurementscould not be resolved to\nsupport the scheduled launch time.\nSubsequentevaluationof the lubrication oil pressure of the auxiliary\npower units (APU) 1 and 3 resulted in\na decision to delay the launch until\nthe APU\'s 1 and 3 could be flushed\nand the filters replaced.\nOn\nNovember 11, the revised flight\nschedule of November 12 was placed in\n\nsome jeopardy by the malfunction\nof\none of Columbia\'s multiplexer\nunits.\nA unit from Challenger,\nthe second\nShuttle Orbiter then under construction,\nwas flown to KSC and launch\noccurred at the revised time.\nWhen\nthe refurbished\nColumbia made its\nsecond flight it carried a space a.pplication payload and a remote manlpulator. Due to a fuel cell failure,\nthe planned five-day mission was\nshortened to about 54 hours. The\nColumbia landed at the Edwards Air\nForce Base runway 23, 2 days, 6\nhours, and 13 minutes into the mission. The Commander of the mission\nwas Joe H. Engle, and the Pilot was\nRichard H. Truly.\nThe crew for STS-3 consisted of Jack\nR. Lousma, Commander, and C. Gordon\nFullerton,Pilot. Launch took place\non March 22, 1982, at 10:59 A.M. EST\nfor a planned duration of seven days.\nThe mission was originally planned\nfor a landing at Edwards Air Force\nBase, California,but due to adverse\n(wet) lake bed runway conditions,the\nprimary landing site was moved to\nWhite Sands, New Mexico. Again, adverse weather conditionschanged the\nplan. The Orbiter landed safely on\nthe eighth day at 11:05 A.M. EST,\nMarch 30, 1982. The major activities\nof the STS-3 flight were the thermal\ntesting as well as opening and closing of the payload bay doors. The\nthermal testing consisted of placing\nthe Orbiter in four attitudes for\nextended periodsof time to determine\nthe thermal responses of specific\nareas. All payload bay door closures\nduring the various attitudes were\nsuccessfulexcept during the thermal\ntest tail-to-Sunattitude. This situation was cleared after reorienting\nthe Orbiter to the top-to-Sun attitude for approximately 15 minutes\nfollowed by a short period of passive\nthermal control.\n\nSTS-4 was flown as planned with the\nlaunch on June 27, 1982, at 10:00\nA.M. EST.\nIt landed on July 4,\n1982, at 11:11A.M. EST on the runway\nat Edwards Air Force Base.\nThe\nnominal landing on the Edwards runway\n(not lake bed) occurred on the 206th\nbirthdayof the United States and was\nattended by President Reagan and the\nFirst Lady.\nThe major activities\nduring the fourth OFT included remote\nmanipulator system operationswith a\n90 pound payload (InducedEnvironment\nContaminationMonitor). This flight\nalso includedthe first Departmentof\nDefense payload. All of the Orbiter\nServices required were payload supplied as planned,with one exception.\nThe carrying harness betweenthe crew\ncabin area and the Get-Away Special\n(GAS) experiment was not satisfactory, but the crew was successfulin\nworking around this problem and activating the GAS experiment.\nAll\nspacecraft systems operated satisfactorily throughout the STS-4 mission with only minor problems that\ndid not impact the results of the\nmission. The fourth OFT crew consisted of T.K. Mattingly, Commander,\nand Henry W. Hartsfield,Jr., Pilot.\n\nThe OFT missions providedmedical information on the eight Shuttle crewmembers. Although the sample numbers\nare small and the astronauts spent\nvaring amounts of time in microgravity, an attempt is made to give a\nsummary of the various aspects of\nmedical support.\nAdditional information about the\nmedical results of STS missions may\nbe obtained by reviewing\nthe\nfollowingNASA TechnicalMemoranda:\n58240\n\nSTS-1\nMedical\nReport\n\nDecember 1981\n\n58245\n\nSTS-2\nMedical\nReport\n\nMay 1982\n\n58247\n\nSTS-3\nMedical\nReport\n\nAugust 1982\n\nThere is no medical report for STS-4;\nthe informationcovering this mission\nis included in this summary OFT\nreport.\n\nEVALUATIONOF CREW HEALTH\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nSam L. Pool, M.D.\nNASA medical personnel are responsible for the health of all persons\nflying in NASA spacecraft. This includes the applicationof principles\nof preventive medicine, as well as\nthe treatmentof any illnessesor injuries occurringas a result of space\nflight. All personnel who fly on\nNASA spacecraft must hold a current\nmedical certification. The classifications currently in use are Class I\nfor pilot astronauts, Class II for\nmission specialist astronauts, and\nClass Ill for payload specialists,\nDuring OFT, each crewman underwent\nfour preflight medical evaluations\nwhich began 30 days prior to the\nflight and were concluded on launch\nmorning. Included in these evaluations were general examinations, a\ndental examination, plus clinical\nlaboratoryand stress tests,\nCrew health status was evaluated in\naccordancewith the schedule shown in\nTable 1-1.\nAll eight OFT crewmen\nwere found to be in excellenthealth\nprior to flight. One backup flight\ncrewmemberdevelopedan upper respiratory infection and was removed from\nroutine contact with other crewmembers in the preflightperiod.\nSeveral postflight medical evaluations were conducted on each crewmember. The first examination was\ndone within one hour after landing\nand included a medical debriefing,a\nphysical and laboratoryexamination,\nAll crewmen were returned to flight\nstatusthree to five days later,\nPhysiological changes observed as a\nresult of the OFT missions have been\nsimilar in nature to those observed\nin Apollo and Skylab programs. Cephalic fluid shifts have invariably\noccurred. Acceleratedheart rates on\nlaunch and reentry were similar in\n\nmagnitude to those recorded in previous flights. Space adaptationsyndrome was symptomaticin approximately 50 percent of crewmembers flown.\nOrthostatic intolerancewas observed\namong those crewmemberswho had not\nreceived countermeasures. Hormonal,\nelectrolyte, and immunological responsesspecificto space flight were\nagain observed upon return to the\nEarth\'s environment. Most of these\nimmediatepostflightchanges occurred\nfrom a few hours to one day postflight and returned to preflight\nbaseline by the third to fifth day\npostflight.\nUnlike previous space flights, OFT\ncrewmembers actively participatedin\nthe piloting of the spacecraftduring\nentry. Comments by the crews dealing\nwith proprioceptive experiences in\nthis phase of the mission have been\nnoted elsewhere in this report. It\nhas been postulatedthat these sensations are the resultsof the workload\ndistributionand/or the neuro-sensory\nrealignments\nexhibitedas a result of\nexposure to reentry gravitational\nforces.\nAdditional studies are\nunderway.\nNo significantresidualphysiological\ndecrements have been elicited postflight. As a result of the confidence gained from the practice of\nspace medicine in the OFT period, a\nless conservative medical approach\nhas been taken toward the flight\ncertification of space crews. For\nexample,all crewmemberswere returned to regular duties at least five\ndays after return from space flight.\nSince the STS may function as an\norbiting research laboratory, especially when carrying the pressurized\nSpacelabmodule, a more sophisticated\nscientific approach toward the study\nof physiological\nadaptationand testing of countermeasures planned.\nis\n\nTABLE I-I\n\nExam\nSchedule\n\nMEDICALEVALUATIONS\nSCHEDULE-ORBITAL\nFLIGHT TESTS\n\nAnnual Flight Flight Flight Flight\nFlight\n-30\n-i0\n-2\n-0\nExam Days\nDays\nDays\n\nInflight\nLanding Landing\nEach Day +0 Days 3 to 6\nDays\n\nLocation\n\nJSC\n\nJSC\n\nJSC\n\nJSC\n\nKSC\n\nApproximate Time\n(hours)\n\n4:00\n\n1:30\n\n0:45\n\n0:i0\n\n0:I0\n\nabout\n0:05***\n\nL\nM\n\nPX(ab)\n\nPMC\n\nExam\nComponents\n\n*\n\nPX\nL\nA\nV\nT\nCST*\nD\n\nPX\nPX(ab)\nL\nL\nA\nM\nV\nCVE\nD\nHS**\nCST80\n\nAnnual 100%treadmill\n\n** Flight-lO\n\nunless under age 35.\n\nday exam qualifies\n\ncrew for\n\n***Duration\nvariable at crew discretion\nover monitoring station.\nPX\nPXC(ab)\nL\nM\nA\nV\nT\nCST\nD\nCVE\nPMC\nHS\n\n-\n\nstart\n\nMCCto\nspacecraft\n\nLand\n\nJSC\n\n0:30\n\n!:30\n\nPX(ab)\nL\nM\nA\nV\nCVE\n\nPX\nL\nA\nV\nD\nCVE\n\nThen 100%every 3 years.\nof HS program.\n\nand time available\n\nduring\n\nComplete Physical\nAbbreviated Physical\nLaboratory\nMicrobiology\nAudiometry\nVisual Acuity\nTonometry\nCardiovascular\nStress Test 80% of predicted max\nDental\nCardiovascular\nEvaluation (Stand Test-Echocardiogram)\nPrivate Medical Conference MCCSurgeon and crew\nHealth Stabilization\nProgram\n\npass\n\nCREW\nMEDICALTRAINING\nJames M. Vanderploeg,\n\nCHAPTER\n2\nM.D.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nThe objective\nof the crew medical\ntraining\nfor the Orbital Flight Test\n(OFT) portion of the Space Transportation\nSystem (STS) program was to\nprovide\neach astronaut\nwith\nthe\nknowledge and skills\nnecessary to\nrespond to inflight\nillnesses\nand\ninjuries\nin an appropriate\nand expedient manner.\nAn additional\nfeature of this medical training\nwas the\neducation of the crewmembers in the\nvarious\nphysiological\nchanges which\noccur during space flight\nand the\nappropriate\ncountermeasures to these\nchanges.\nThis objective\nwas met\nthrough\nboth the general\nmedical\ntraining\nwhich is part of each astronaut\'s initial\ntraining\nand missionspecific\ntraining\nin preparation\nfor\neach of the OFT missions.\n\na.\n\nb.\n\nOperational\nBioinstrumentation\nSystem (OBS)\n(I)\ncomponents\n(2) donned configuration\n(3) on-orbit\ncontingency use\n\nc.\n\nAnti-Gravity\nSuit (AGS)\n(i)\ncomponents\n(2) pressure controller\noperations\n\nd.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nShuttle Orbiter Medical System\n(SOMS)\nII)\ncontents\n(2) uses\n(3) location and stowage\n\nRadiation Equipment\n(i)\ncomponents\n(2)\nlocations\n(3) on-orbit\ncontingency\n\nuse\n\nAfter completion of the workbook, the\ntraining\nwas conducted in classroom\nsessions.\nFor the STS-1 through\nSTS-3 flight\ncrews, this training\nwas\npresented in three courses of three\nhours each plus an F-30 premission\nreview and medical briefing.\nThese\ncourses were entitled\nMedical Procedures 2101, 2201 and 2301. The premission briefing\nwas entitled\nMedical\nProcedures 4101. The overall organization of the medical training\nwas\nstreamlined for the STS-4 flight\ncrew\nin order to eliminate\nthe redundancy\nof the three classroom courses and to\nmake the training\nmore time efficient.\nConsequently, the materials\nof Medical Procedures 2101, 2201 and\n2301 were consolidated\ninto\none\ncourse of three and one-half\nhours\nduration entitled\nMedical Procedures\n2101A.\nIn conjunction\nwith this,\nMedical Procedures 4101 was expanded\nto two and one-half hours and included a more extensive\nreview of the\n\nEach astronaut\'s\ninitial\nmedical\ntraining\ninvolves _ 16 hours of instruction\nduring the first\nyear following selection.\nThe curriculum of\nthis training\nis listed in Table 2-1.\nAlso included during the first\nyear\nof training\nis a two day course in\naltitude\nphysiology.\nThe course content is listed\nin Table 2-2.\nThis\nmaterial\nis reviewed\nevery three\nyears in a one day refresher course,\nMission specific medical training\nfor\nthe OFT astronauts was consistent\nin\ncontent for each of the flight\ncrews,\nbut the organization\nof the materials\nvaried\nto accommodate individual\ntraining\nschedules.\nThe inital\nportion of this training\ninvolved cornpletion\nof the self-study\nworkbook,\nMED EQ 2102. Topics covered in the\nMedical Equipment Workbook were the\nfollowing:\n\n5\n\nmaterial\n2101A.\n\nfrom Medical Procedures\n\nThe curriculum of Medical Procedures\n2101A is outlined in Table 2-3. In\nthis course, the crewmembers were\ntaught the techniques of measuring\nvital signs, examining the eyes,\nears, throat, neck, chest and abdomen; diagnosingand treating various\nillnesses and injuries; as well as\nobtaining microbiological cultures.\nThroughout this training the SOMS\nmedical kits and checklistwere used\nextensively. Thus, the crewmembers\nlearned the organizationand uses of\nthe SOMS while the examination and\ntreatmenttechniqueswere being practiced. Several emergency procedures\nwere demonstrated and practiced,\nThese included one-man cardiopulmonary resuscitation(CPR), the Heimlich\nmaneuver,cricothyrotomy,\nand splinting and bandagingtechniques,\nAreas covered in Medical Procedures\n4101 are listed in Table 2-4. This\nsession was attended by the crew\nphysician, deputy crew physician,\nMission Operations Control Room\n\n6\n\n(MOCR) surgeons and the flight crew\nfor each flight. During this training, the physicians and flight crew\nwere able to discuss the physiologic\nchanges of zero-gravityand appropriate countermeasures well as review\nas\nmedical procedures and treatment\ntechniques.\nCONCLUSION\nEach flight crew for STS-1 through\nSTS-4 completed the required medical\ntraining. For STS-1 through STS-3 a\nbackup crewwas designatedwho subsequently became the prime crew for a\nlater mission. Those individuals\nreceived additional medical training\nsince they participated in training\nsessions both as backup and prime\ncrewmembers. The use of the SOMS\ninflightduring OFT demonstratedthat\nthe objectivefor crew medical training was accomplished. When use of\nthe medical kits was required inflight, the crewmemberswere able to\nrespond to the MOCR surgeon\'s instructions promptly and without\ndifficulty.\n\nTABLE 2-1\n\nTABLE 2-3\n\nCURRICULUMOF INITIAL\nMEDICAL TRAINING\n\nMEDICAL PROCEDURESTRAINING 2101A\n\nCentral and PeripheralNervous System\nVisual System\nAuditoryand VestibularSystems\nDental Health\nCardiovascular\nSystem\nPulmonarySystem\nGastrointestinal\nSystem\nGenitourinarySystem\nMusculoskeletal\nSystem\n\nSOMS Medical Kits and Medical Checklist\nMicrobiology: Techniques for Cultures\nVital Signs Determination\nPhysicalExaminationTechniques\nTreatmentTechniques\n\nTABLE 2-2\n\nTABLE 2-4\n\nALTITUDE PHYSIOLOGYTRAINING\n\nCompositionof the Atmosphere\nGas Laws\nHypoxia:Signs, Symptoms,Treatment\nLife Support EquipmentOperation\nEffects of IncreasedG Loading\nL-1 and M-1Anti-G Maneuvers\nAnti-G Suit Use\nAltitude ChamberRide\n\nMEDICALPROCEDURESTRAINING 4101\n\nAnti-G Suit\nBiomedicalElectrodes\nDehydration\nExercise\nEVA and Aspirin Use\nHealth Stabilization\nProgram\nMedicalMission Rules\nPhysical Exam Schedule:Preflightand\nPostflight\nPrivateMedicalCommunication\nRadiationDosimeter\nReviewof Medical Kits and Procedures\nSpace AdaptationSyndrome\n\nFIGURE 3-1\n\nSHUTTLEORBITERMEDICALSYSTEM\nJames M. Vanderploeg,\n\nCHAPTER\n3\n\nM.D.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nThe Shuttle\nOrbiter\nMedical System\n(SOMS) is a product of the development of onboard medical kits\nwhich\nhave been in use throughout\nthe\nhistory\nof U.S. manned space flight.\nDesigned for use during the Orbital\nFlight\nTests (OFT), the "A" version\nof the SOMSprovides treatment capability\nfor life-threatening\nemergencies and permits diagnosis and treatment of many less severe illnesses\nand injuries.\nThe inventory\nof the\nSOMS-A is intended to sustain\nthe\nmedical needs of a two-man crew for\nup to 14 days.\nDISCUSSION\nThe total\nsystem is composed of the\nMedicine and Bandage Kit (MBK), the\nEmergency Medical Kit (EMK), and the\nMedical Checklist\nas well as other\nOrbiter systems such as the Portable\nOxygen System (POS). In the EMKare\nfour\npallets\nwith items stowed on\nboth sides.\nIncluded in the pallets\nare injectable\nmedications,\nIV supplies, most diagnostic equipment, the\nsuturing equipment, and the microbiological\nculturing\nsupplies.\nThe MBK\ncontains\nthree pallets\nwith items\nstowed on both sides of each pallet,\nAll oral,\ntopical\nand suppository\nmedications;\nmost bandage items and\nsome diagnostic\nequipment are in the\nMBK.\nThe Medical Checklist\nis composed of\ntwo parts.\nThe first\nis a generic\ndocument (JSI-17327)\nwhich contains\nchecklist\ninstructions\nfor medical\nemergencies,\nlaboratory\nprocedures,\nand supplementary illustrations.\nThe\nsecond part is issued as a Flight\nSupplement and is composed of an\nalphabetical\nand a usage listing\nof\nthe medical kit contents.\nBy issuing\n\nthis as a flight\nsupplement, medications can be modified from flight\nto\nflight\nto accommodate specific\ncrew\nrequirements.\nThe SOMS-Ais shown in\nFigure 3-1.\nThroughout the history\nof the space\nprogram, part of the premission preparation has been the evaluation of an\nindividual\nastronaut\'s\nsensitivity\nto\nany of the drugs contained in the\nmedical kit.\nKnowledge of any alIergic reaction or undesirable side effect to the medical kit contents is\nimperative for effective\nhealth care\nby the Mission\nOperations\nControl\nRoom (MOCR) surgeons\nand crew\nphysicians.\nA drug sensitivity\nevaluation\nwas\nconducted prior to each OFT mission.\nThis was carried out in two segments.\nFirst,\neach crewmember\'s\nhealth\nrecord was reviewed and every medication he had received either\nfor a\nclinical\nindication\nor for previous\ndrug sensitivity\ntesting was recorded.\nAny reported reactions\nor side\neffects were also recorded.\nThe second segment of this evaluation\ninvolved testing each crewmember with\nthose medications which were felt to\nhave a high likelihood\nfor use in\nflight.\nThis testing\nwas scheduled\nsuch that no flying\nwas undertaken\nfor 24 hours following\nthe ingestion\nof any medication.\nMost of the tests\nwere done in conjunction\nwith flight\nsimulation exercises.\nSedatives were\ntaken at home in the evening to evaluate sleep\ninduction\nas well\nas\nalertness\nthe following\nday.\nPrior\nto being issued any medication the\ncrewmember was briefed\non possible\nside effects\nand allergic\nmanifestations\nas well as the procedure to\n\nfollow\nto\nattention.\n\nobtain\n\nemergency\n\nmedical\n\nCONCLUSION\nUse was made of the SOMS-A during the\nOFT missions\nfor\nthe treatment\nof\nmedical conditions.\nTable 3-2 lists\nthe various\nitems\nand medications\nutilized\nin flight.\nIn each instance\nin which use of the medical\nkits was\nrequired,\nthe appropriate\nitems were\npresent\nand readily\nlocated\nby the\ncrewmember.\n\nThe information\ngained from the drug\nsensitivity\nevaluation\nwas checked\nagainst\nthe contents\nof the SOMS-A.\nThus,\nthe physicians\nmade certain\nthat\nno medication\nwas carried\non\nboard to which a crewman was unusually sensitive.\nTable 3-1 lists\nthe\nmedications\nconsidered\nto have a\nprobability\nof use.\n\nTABLE3-I\nMEDICATIONS\nHAVINGA HIGH PROBABILITYOF USE\nActifed\nAfrin Nasal Spray\nAmoxicillin\nAspirin\nBenadryl, 25 mg\nBetadine (Povidone-lodine)\nCodeine, 15 mg\nCompazine, I0 mg\nCortisporin\nOtic Suspension\nDalmane, 30 mg\nDexedrine, 5 mg\nKeflex, 250 mg\n\nLomotil\nMycolog Cream\nMylanta\nParafon Forte\nPhenergan, 25 mg\nPolysporin\nPyridium, 200 mg\nScopolamine/Dexedrine,\n0.4/5 mg\nSulfacetamide Ophthalmic\nTetracycline,\n250 mg\nTylenol\n\nTABLE 3-2\nSOMS\nITEMS USEDDURINGOFT MISSION\nAscriptin\nTablets\nFlurazepam Hydrochloride\nCapsules\nMylanta Tablets\nScopol ami ne/Dexedri ne Capsules\nScopolamine Skin Patch\nTempadot Disposable\nThermometer\n\nI0\n\nVALIDATIONOF PREDICTIVETESTSAND\nCOUNTERMEASURES\nFORSPACEMOTION\nSICKNESS\n\nCHAPTER\n4\n\nJerry L. Homick, Ph.D.\nINTRODUCTION\nSpace motion sickness has been characterized\nas a maladaptation phenomenon that is experienced by some individuals\nduring the first\nfew days\nof exposure to microgravity.\nThe\nsyndrome may include such symptoms as\ndepressed appetite,\na nonspecific malaise, performance decrements, gastrointestinal disturbances, nausea\nand vomiting. The precisemechanisms\nunderlyingspace motion sickness are\nnot fully understood;however, investigators generally agree that the\nsyndrome has its origin in the vestibular system. Neither techniquesfor\nthe a priori identificationof persons susceptible to this syndrome,\nnor effective and operationallyacceptable countermeasures have been\nfully developed.\n\norder\nto\nsolutions.\n\nobtain\n\nfinal\n\nand\n\nvalid\n\nA Flight\nSupplementary\nObjective\n(FSO) was developed to initiate\nthis\ndata collection\nwith the first\nfour\nShuttle missions.\nA primary purpose\nof this FSO was to conduct inflight\nobservations, supported by a series\nof preflight and postflight data\ncollection procedures, in an effort\nto begin validating ground-based\ntests which may be predictive of\nsusceptibilityto the space motion\nsickness syndrome. An additional\nobjectivewas to implementcrew testing procedureswhich would enable acquisitionof data to be used in validating countermeasures.\nMATERIALSAND METHODS\n\nExperiencefrom previous flights indicates that the space sickness syndrome represents a potential threat\nto the operationalefficacy and physical well-being of future crewmembers. Although none of the Mercury\nor Gemini flight crews reported space\nsickness, 33% of the Apollo crewmen\nexperienced symptoms and 54% of the\nSkylab crewmen had symptoms. Reports\nfrom the USSR indicatethat about 40%\nof the Soviet cosmonautshave experienced space motion sickness. These\ncombineddata suggestthat if no corrective actions are taken, up to 40%\nof Shuttle crewmemberscould experience some degree of space sickness\nduring the first few days of flight,\nBecauseof its complexityand uniqueness, this biomedicalproblem cannot\nbe resolved solely with ground-based\nresearch. It is essentialthat data\nbe collected systematicallyon individuals who fly Shuttle missions in\n11\n\nPreflight\nPart of the required crew preflight\nactivity was based on guidelinesset\nforth in NASA\'s medical operations\npolicy for the prophylaxisand treatment of space motion sickness with\nanti-motion sickness drugs. This\npolicy states that astronautswith a\npositive historyof space sicknessor\nwith no space flight experiencewill\nbe premedicated with a previously\nselected anti-motion sickness drug.\nPremedicationis operationallydefined as taking the prescribed drug\nprior to launch or immediatelyafter\nthe inflightOrbitalManueveringSubsystem (OMS I) correction maneuver.\nThe OMS 1 occurs about 10 minutes\nafter orbital insertion. The policy\nfurther states that astronauts who\nhave flown in space with no symptom\nof space sicknessare not requiredto\n\nbe premedicated. Any individualwho\nexperiences space motion sickness\nwill be administeredappropriateinflight treatment with anti-motion\nsickness drugs. The policy requires\npreflightside effects screening and\nefficacy -testingwith one or more\nanti-motionsicknessmedications,\n\nscreening was typically done under\noperationalconditions. For example,\nthe crewman would use a medication\nwhile working in the Shuttle simulator. Verbal reports of any side effects experiencedwere given to the\ncrew physician and documented. The\nmedicationmost frequently evaluated\n(and most preferred) was oral Scopolamine (0.4 milligrams) plus Dexedrine (5.0 milligrams). A recently\ndeveloped transdermal (skin patch)\nmethod of administering Scopolamine\nwas evaluatedby a few crewmen.\n\nDuring the early preflightperiod the\neight crewmembers completed a questionnairedesigned to elicit information regarding past experienceswith\nvarious motion environments and responsesto those environments.\n\nCrewmen who were required to be premedicated for flight were tested in\nthe Neurophysiology Laboratory to\nevaluate the efficacy of the preferred medication in preventing or\nminimizingmotion sickness. The CSSI\ntest proceduresdescribed above were\nused. In a few cases where the initially preferred medication produced\nquestionable results, the test was\nrepeated with the same medication or\na differentmedication. A minimum of\ntwo weeks was maintained between the\nrotating chair tests to minimize\nadaptationeffects.\n\nApproximately three to six months\nbeforeflight each of the crewmembers\nwere tested at least one time for\nsusceptibility\nto experimentallyinduced motion sickness in the Johnson\nSpace Center (JSC) Neurophysiology\nLaboratory. The standard Coriolis\nSickness SusceptibilityIndex (CSSI)\ntest was used. This procedure requires the performanceof head movements while rotating at a constant\nvelocityin a servo-controlled\nchair,\nThe test was terminated when the\ncrewmember reached the Malaise III\nlevel (8 symptom points) of motion\nsickness or performed 150 head movements, whichever occurred first.\nThis test served two purposes.\nFirst, it provided a ground based\nsusceptibility data point against\nwhich inflight susceptibilitycould\nbe compared. Second, it provided a\nbaseline for subsequent evaluations\nof anti-motion sickness drug efficacy. During this test session the\ncrewmembers were instructed on the\nself-recognition and reporting of\nmotion sickness symptoms. They were\nalso i:nstructed on the use of a\nmicrocassette recorder and symptom\nchecklist which were to be used\ninflightfor symptom reporting,\n\nInflight\nA microcassette tape recorder and\nsymptom checklist were stowed onboard. The flight crewmen were required to use the recorder and checklist during a designated pre-sleep\nperiod each Mission Day to debrief on\nany symptoms or sensations that had\nbeen experienced.\nPostflight\nQuestions pertainingto motion sickness and vestibular sensations were\nasked of each crewman on the day of\nlanding and during the postflight\nmedical debriefing. Two additional\nmotion sickness susceptibilitytests\nwere also requiredpostflight. These\nwere the off-vertical rotation test\nand the sudden-stop test, both of\nwhich were to be performed one time\n\nIn accordancewith the medical operations policy, all of the crewmembers\nwere screened for side effects with\none or more medications.\nThis\n\n12\n\nfor each crewman within three months\nfollowingthe mission. The purpose\nof these postflight tests was to\nacquire additionalground-basedsusceptibility data against which inflight susceptibilitycould be compared. These tests were intentionally scheduled for the postflight\nperiod because inadequate crew time\nexistedpreflight,\n\nwork efficacy of more severely affected crewmen was temporarily impaired to a minor degree, but at no\nzlme were they unable to perform\ntheir required tasks. Complete recovery from symptoms always occurred\nwithin 36 to 72 hours of onset.\n\nRESULTS\nThe motion experience questionnaire\nindicatedthat all of the crewmembers\nhad a minimal history of susceptibility to terrestrial forms of motion\nsickness. The questionnairerevealed\nthat a few crewmen had experienced\nsome motion sickness symptoms during\npast exposures to aerobatic flight,\nparabolic flight and heavy sea conditions. The questionnaire results\ndid not correlatewith the actual incidence of space sickness reportedby\nthis group of eight crewmen,\nThe preflight CSSI test results,\nanti-motion sickness drugs used inflight and occurrences of space\nmotion sickness are summarized in\nTable 4-1. The mean preflight CSSI\nscore for the eight crewmen was 41.4\n(S.D. = 27.9) on a scale of 0-100\nwhere a CSSI score of 100 means\nextreme resistance to motion sickness.\n\nThe mean preflight CSSI scores for\nthe four crewmen who experiencedinflight symptoms and the four who did\nnot report inflight symptoms were\n31.5 and 51.2, respectively. Because\nof the high variance in the data and\nthe small sample size, this difference was not statistically significant.\nFive of the eight crewmen utilized\noral Scopolamineplus Dexedrine as a\nprophylacticmedication. In all of\nthese cases the medicationwas taken\nafter the OMS 1 maneuver. Four of\nthese same crewmen experienced some\ndegree of space motion sickness. One\ncrewman used the transdermalScopolamine skin patch (applied 12 hours\npre-launch) and reported no inflight\nsymptoms. As indicatedby Table 4-1,\nseveral crewmen used an additional\ndose or doses of anti-motionsickness\nmedication on Mission Days 1, 2, or\n3.\nNone of the eight crewmen experienced\nany motion sickness or other unusual\nvestibular sensations post-landing.\nWith one exception, no vestibular\ndisturbanceis experienced as a result of exposure to gravito-internal\nforces during reentry and landing.\nOne crewmen did experience a transient vertigoduring reentry.\n\nBy way of contrast, the mean CSSI\nscore for a normative populationof\n225 non-astronautindividualsat JSC\nis 12.2 (S.D. = 9.3).\nAs indicated by Table 4-1, four out\nof eight crewmen reported symptoms\nthat were interpretedas being space\nmotion sickness. The predominant\nsymptoms reported were decreased\nappetite, epigastric discomfort of\nvarying degrees and general malaise,\nThree crewmen experienced a single\nepisodeof emesis. The emesis usually occurred abruptly and resulted in\na rapid diminutionof symptoms. The\n\nDISCUSSION\nThe incidence of space motion sickness experienced during the first\nfour Space Shuttle flights was not\nunexpected when considering past\nspace flight results. The severity\nof symptomswas never extreme and the\naffectedcrewmen\'sperformancewas at\nno time compromised.\n13\n\nTABLE 4-1\nSUMMARYOF SPACE MOTION SICKNESSRELATED DATA ON STS FLIGHTS 1-4\nPreflight\n\nCretan*\n\nChair\nHead\nRPM Movements\n\nInflight\n\nSymptom\nPoints\n\nCSSI\nScores\n\nDrug\nUsed\n\nSymptoms\nReported\n\n1\n\n25\n\n150\n\n0\n\n64.5\n\nScop/Dex (1)\n\nNo\n\n2\n\n15\n\n110\n\n9\n\n18.15\n\nScop/Dex (2)\n\nYes\n\n3\n\n20\n\n45\n\n9\n\n12.6\n\nScop/Dex (3,2,1)\n\nYes\n\n4\n\n25\n\n150\n\n0\n\n64.5\n\nScop/Dex (1,1)\n\nYes\n\n5\n\n20\n\n110\n\n9\n\n30.8\n\nScop/Dex (3,2,1)\n\nYes\n\n6\n\n20\n\n85\n\n8\n\n23.8\n\nNone\n\nNo\n\n7\n\n20\n\n95\n\n12\n\n26.6\n\nTTS Scop (1,1)\n\nNo\n\n8\n\n30\n\n150\n\n2\n\n90.0\n\nNone\n\nNo\n\n=\nS.D.:\n\n41.1\n27.9\n\nScop/Dex - Scopolamine (.4 mg) + Dexedrine (5 mg)\nTTS Scop- Transdermal Scopolamine\nNote:\n\nValues in parenthesis indicate number of doses\nper day, e.g. (I,I)\nwould indicate one dose on\nMission Day 1 and one dose on Mission Day 2.\n\n*Crewman listed\n\nin random order\n\n14\nL \xe2\x80\xa2\n\nIn assessing the effectiveness of\nmedications utilized, it must be\nrecognizedthat the medicationswere\ntaken after the OMS 1 maneuver and\nmay have had insufficient time to\nreach a therapeuticlevel before the\ncrewmenwere stressed.

The most pronounced influence on heart rate is reflected\nby\nsychological\ninputs which occur at\nift-off,\nsolid rocket booster separation,\nand orbital\ninsertion.\nResponses were similar\nbetween flights\nand crewpersons so that these data\ncan be considered typical,\n\npresented in Table 5-1.\nThe crewpersons are identified\nonly by an\narbitrarily\nassigned number and the\norder in which they are presented\ndoes not follow any pattern in order\nto preserve the confidentiality\nof\npersonal medical data.\nIt is readily\nseen that heart rate elevation\nis the\nmajor response to orthostatic\nstress\nand that crewmen universally\nincrease\ntheir\nheart\nrate\nin response\nto\nstress and also increase the magnitude of this response in the deconditioned state.\nThe one exception to\nthe latter\nstatement\noccurred\nin\ncrewman 7 whose postflight\ndelta\nheart rate,\nlying to standing,\nwas\nsimilar\nto that observed preflight.\nThis resulted in an inadequate blood\npressure and evidence of inadequate\ncerebral\nperfusion.\nThe average\nheart rate increase preflight\ndue to\northostatic\nprovocation was 13 + 6.3\nbeats/min.\nPostflight\nthis value was\n33.3 + 13.4 beats/min.\nYet the resting supine heart rate postflight\nwas\n16.9 _+ 7.4 beats/min\ngreater\nthan\npreflight.\n\nDuring entry, heart rates were more\nsignificantly\ninfluenced by the force\nof gravity,\nwhich was experienced\nhead-to-toe,\nand by the effects that\nweightlessness\nhad on cardiovascular\ndeconditioning.\nThe biomedical harness carrying ECG data on the pilots\nfor STS-2 and STS-3 failed\ndue to\nmalthreading of the connector; therefore, no entry data were obtained on\nthese two crewmen. Summarydata for\nthe commanders of all four OFT missions for comparison are presented in\nFigure 5-2.\nAs can be seen, it was\nnot uncommonfor a crewman to experience heart rates of 90 percent of\nhis prior excercise determined maximumheart rate.\n\nIn a like\nmanner,\nsystolic\nblood\npressure postflight\nuniversally\ndecreased with orthostatic\nstress,\nbut\ndiastolic\npressure responded variably\nwith no change or with\nupward or\ndownward changes.\nIn nearly\nall\ncrewmen, however, these changes resulted\nin a decrease in the pulse\npressure (systolic\nB.P. minus diastolic\nB.P.) when the crewman was in\nthe upright posture.\n\nDuring preflight\nexaminations as well\nas during prior testing,\none crewmember was noted to have occasional premature\nventricular\ncontractions\n(PVC\'s) occurring\nas isolated\nunifocal\nventricular\nectopic\nactivity\nwhich never exceeded two to three\nectopics\nper minute and was usually\nabolished\nwith higher heart rates,\nDuring entry this same crewman exhibited\nunifocal\nPVC\'s during nearly\nevery minute after the onset of gravitational\nloading.\nPVC\'s occurred at\nrates up to 16 ectopics\nper minute\nand averaged four beats per minute,\nA second crewmember exhibited\na rare\nPVC during the entry phase.\nHe had\nno significant\nprior history\nof ventricular\nectopy.\nSerum electrolytes\nwere not abnormal in either crewman,\n\nAs a consequence, we have derived a\nformula for estimating\nthe degree of\ncardiovascular\ndeconditioning\ndue to\nspace flight\nand have standardized\nthis\nvalue to the individual\npreflight\nresponse to testing.\nThe\nCardiovascular\nIndex of Deconditioning (CID) is defined as the change in\nheart rate standing postflight\ncompared to preflight\nminus the change\nin systolic\nblood pressure standing\npostflight\ncompared to preflight\nplus\nthe change in diastolic\nblood pres-\n\nThe results\nof orthostatic\nprovocation by means of the stand test are\n\n18\n\nSTS-OFT ENTRY PROFILE\n\n3.2\n\nt\n\n160\n\n2.8\n\n,o\n\n-,\nOF\nCDR IN BPM\n\nt\n\n___\n\n1.2\n\n80\n\n-\n\n, .. i\n\n60\n\n0.8\n\n40\n\n-o-\n\nGZ FORCE (STS-2)\nSTS-1 CDR (2 1/2 DAYS)\n\n0.4\n\n20\n\n-_-_\n\nSTS-2 CDR (2 i/2 DAYS)\nSTS-3 CDR (8 DAYS)\n\n0.0\n\n--\':"-- STS-4 CDR (7 DAYS)\n._I\n\n-40\n\nI\n\n-38\n\nI\n\n-32\n\nI\n\nI\n\n-28\n\n-24\n\nI\n\nI\n\n-20\n\n--16\n\nI\n\n-12\n\nI\n\n-8\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\n-4\n\n0\n\n+4\n\n+8\n\nTIME IN MINUTES RELATIVE TO TOUCHDOWN\n\nFI6URE5-2\n\nI\nI\n\n+12\n\nALONG\nZ AXIS\n\nTABLE 5-1 - OFT STAND TEST RESULTS\n\nCrewmember\n\nDuration of\nSpaceflight\nin days\n\nPreflight\nPostflight\nHeart Rate*/BloodPressure**\nSupine\nStanding\nSupine\nStanding\n\n1\n\n2.5\n\n54\n110/70\n\n71\n105/68\n\n80\n118/62\n\n111\n118/86\n\n2\n\n8\n\n53\n100/70\n\n65\n100/72\n\n77\n118/82\n\n127\n104/70\n\n3\n\n2.5\n\n4\n\n8\n\n61\n127/88\n52\n118/80\n\n73\n145/92\n70\n105/80\n\n61\n120/80\n77\n140/84\n\n99\n110/80\n120\n120/98\n\n5\n\n7\n\n53\n130/80\n\n60\n118/78\n\n69\n128/84\n\n97\n126/82\n\n6\n\n2.5\n\n59\n129/76\n\n65\n137/86\n\n66\n140/110\n\n85\n135/110\n\n7\n\n2.5\n\n78\n118/76\n\n102\n118/76\n\n103\n117/75\n\n126"**\n90/62\n\n8\n\n7\n\n57\n110/68\n\n65\n98/66\n\n69\n108/78\n\n93\n100/68\n\n*Heart Rate (beats/min)\n**SystolicBlood Pressure/Diastolic lood Pressure (mmHq)\nB\n***Indicatesearly terminationof stand test because of clinical evidence of\npresyncope\nTABLE 5-2 - CARDIOVASCULARINDEX OF DECONDITIONING\nCrewmember\n\nCID\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n\n45\n66\n49\n53\n33\n46\n38\n28\n\n20\n\nsure standing postflightcompared to\npreflight. Simply stated, this reduces to the following:\n\nflight duration of STS-3 and STS-4\nwere long enough, however, for the\ncrew to recuperate from the potentially deleterious effects of space\nsickness.\n\nCID = delta HR - delta SBP + delta\nDBP\n\nThe CID values for crewmembersundergoing 2.5 days of spaceflight were\n45, 49, 46 and 38. The CID of 38 in\ncrewman 7 failed to predict his presyncopal episode largely because of\nan inadequateheart rate response to\nfalling blood pressure. This situation occurred in the context of significant inflightvestibulardisturbances and decreased fluid intake.\nThe CID would have to be considered\nuseful only when the cardiovascular\nsystem is still within the limits of\nits compensatoryfactors. Crewman 7\nlost seven pounds of body weight during the flight.\nIf one considers\nthis a single compartmentloss, then\nhe lost approximately19 percent of\nhis extracellularfluid. Values for\nother astronautswith similar flight\ndurations (2.5 days) are less than\nhalf this amount; weight losses of\nthree pounds which correspond to a\nnine percentextracellularfluid loss\n(3).\n\nwhere delta HR = heart rate standing\npostflightminus heart rate standing\npreflight\ndelta SBP = systolic blood pressure\nstanding postflight minus systolic\nblood pressure standingpreflight\ndelta DBP = diastolic blood pressure\nstanding postflight minus diastolic\nblood pressure standing preflight\nInherentin this index is that deconditioning produces an increase in\nheart rate, a drop in systolic blood\npressure, and a decrease in pulse\npressure, although the effect on\ndiastolicpressuremight be variable,\nTherefore, as the value of CID increases, one would assume that the\nresponseof the cardiovascular\nsystem\nis greater and the level of deconditioning, i.e., orthostatic susceptibility, more profound. The data for\nthe OFT crewmembersare presented in\nTable 5-2. The authors believethat\nthis approach to such a complex, and\nunresolved,clinical problem will be\na helpful guide to those responsible\nfor making operational judgements\nwith minimal facilities for data\nacquisition,\n\nCrewmen 5 and 8 had the lowest CID,\n33 and 28, respectively,\nand certainly much lower than the CID of crewmen\nwith similar duration of weightlesshess, 2:CID=66 and 4:CID=53. Crewmen\n5 and 8 participated in an operational medicine study to investigate\nthe effects of saline loading on\northostatictolerance. Each of these\ntwo subjects consumed one liter of\nisotonic saline orally in the hour\nbefore entry interfaceas part of an\nexperimentalprotocol (4). Their CID\nvalues and heart rate profile (Figure\n5-2) appear to reflect this beneficial effect.\nMore data, however,\nwill be accumulated on upcoming\nShuttle flights before conclusions\nare formalized.\n\nDISCUSSION\nThe four missions of the OFT series\nwere heterogeneousfrom a medical as\nwell as an engineering standpoint,\nSTS-1 and STS-2 were short flights\nwhen compared to STS-3 and STS-4.\nVestibular disturbances, known also\nas space sickness, were experienced\nby the crews of the three later\nflights to varying degrees (2).\nThese disturbancesaltered crew fluid\nand food intake in additionto altering their activity levels.\nThe\n\nIn summary, the OFT series has provided evidence of cardiovascular\nde-\n\n21\n\nconditioningreflected in changes in\nheart rate and blood pressureboth at\nrest and in response to orthostatic\nprovocation. Universally, crewmembers react with higher heart rate responsesafter deconditioning. Nevertheless, there appearsto be two categories of blood pressure response.\nOne group responds as a rigid pipe\nwith decreases in systolic and diastolic pressure upon orthostatic\nstress. A second group respondswith\nincreasesin diastolic pressure,and\nin at least one instance, to hypertensive levels.\nThese vascular\nhyper-responders\nappear to have had\ntheir cardiovascular controlling\nmechanisms reset during the weightless period as well as having experiencedthe usual inflight diuresis and\nvolume depletion(5).\nAdditionally,in one astronaut previously noted ventricular ectopic\nactivity was exacerbated. Whether\nthis was a result of the release of\ncatecholamine stimulation from intense psychological\ninput (6), or the\nresult of decreased coronary perfusion due to orthostatic stress, can\nonly be a matter of speculationwith\nthe data available.\n\nREFERENCES\n1.

A number of\nparameters in serum or plasma were\nmeasured, including electrolytes,\nenzymes and hormones. Twenty-fourhour urine pools were collected 30\ndays before flight and on Landing Day\nor day four after landing; some of\nthe same parameters were measured,\nStatistically significant increases\nover preflight levels of serum calcium, glucose, thyroxine and insulin\nand of plasma and urinaryaldosterone\nwere recordedon LandingDay. Significant decreases in serum sodium and\npotassium and urinary calcium, chloride and uric acid occurred on the\nsame day. The results were similar\nin many respects to those from other\nseries of space flights and were interpreted to indicate that although\nfluid and electrolyteloss occur during space flight, conservation of\nthese substancesis begun almost immediately upon cessation of weightlessness. Enzyme and hormone measurements indicated that landing may\nhave caused some stress on crewmembers, especially when compared with\nresults from the Apollo missions,\nThe difference in length of flight\n(54, 169 or 192 hours) did not appear\nto affect the results. Several days\nafter landing, most parameters had\nreturned to preflight levels, but\nsome effects of space flight were\nmore exaggerated or had "overshot"\npreflightlevels,\nINTRODUCTION\nBiochemistry\nand\nendocrinology\nstudieswere conductedon crewmembers\nof STS-1 through STS-4 to provide\n\n23\n\ndata to assist in objective assessment of the health of each crewmen.\nData collected during the preflight\nphase of the mission provided baseline informationto compare to postflight results for detection and\nidentificationof any physiological\nchangeswhich may have resulted from\nexposureto the space flight environment. The first two STS flightsprovided detailed data not previously\nacquired in the U.S. space programon\nmen returningfrom two days in space.\nPhysiologicalchanges for which evidence has been found in the blood and\nurine of crewmembers on other space\nflight series include loss of fluids\nand electrolytes,\ndemineralization\nof\nbone and changes in metabolism of\nprotein and carbohydrates. Measurement of concentrationsof electrolytes, tissue enzymes, hormones and\nother components were undertakento\nbetter understand alterations in\nhomeostatic\nmechanismsresultingfrom\nspace flight.\nMETHODS\nDuring the preflight and postflight\nperiods,the crew consumedthe ground\ncontroldiet of their choosing. Inflight they followed the provided\nShuttle diet. Fluids were available\nwhen desired. In addition to their\nvaried intakes during each mission,\ncrewmembers of STS-2 each drank two\nto three liters of fluid after landing, but before the blood samples\nwere drawn; the crew of STS-3 drank\nGatorade just before landing; and\nthe crew of STS-4 each took eight\nsalt tablets and drank about a liter\nof water in the hours just before\nlanding.\n\nVenous blood was drawn three times\nbeforethe mission, generally30, 10,\nand 2 days before lift-off (F-30,\n-10, -2). After landing, blood was\ndrawn as soon as possible (L+O) and\nthree to five days later (L+3, +4,\n+5). Tab}e 7-1 in "Hematological\nand\nImmunological Analysis" shows the\nsampling schedule for each flight,\nAll blood samples were fasting\nsamples (14 hours) and were collected\nas early in the morning as possible,\nexcept for the one at L+O. Alcoholic\nbeverages were not consumed for at\nleast\n14\nhours\nbefore\nblood\ncollection.\n\ndiuretic hormone (ADH), epinephrine\nand norepinephrine.\nFor each crewman, the mean and standard deviation for the three preflight days were calculatedfor each\nparameter and used as the best preflight control value to compare with\npostflight findings. The percent\nchange was calculatedfor each crewman for L+O and L+3, +4 or +5, and\nthe mean percent change was determined for L+O and for L+3, +4 and +5.\nThe studenttest was used to identify\nsignificantdifferences.\nRESULTS\n\nQuantitativeanalyses of the following blood components (plasma or\nserum)were done: osmolality,sodium,\npotassium, chloride, total calcium,\nmagnesium,\ninorganic\nphosphate\n(IPOA), uric acid, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine,glucose, triglycerides,cholesterol,high density\nlipoprotein (HDL), low density lipoprotein (LDL), very low density lipoprotein (VLDL), total bilirubin,\nalanine aminotransferase (glutamic\noxaloacetic transaminase) (ALT),\naspartate aminotransferase(glutamic\npyruvictransaminase)(AST), alkaline\n_hosphatase,total creatine phosphoinase\n(CPK)\nand\nisoenzymes,\n-glutamyl (GGTP), total lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and isoenzymes,\ntriiodothyroxine (T3), thyroxine\n(T4), thyroid stimulating hormone\nTSH), insulin, human growth hormone\nHGH), angiotensin I, aldosterone,\ncortisol and adrenocorticotrophic\nhormone (ACTH).\n\nSignificant changes in blood and\nurine chemistry, biochemistry and\nendocrinologyare listed on Table 6-1\nby an asterisk.\nSerum Biochemistry- L+O\nIn five out of eight crewmembers,\nserum osmolality had decreased from\nthe preflightcontrol value a maximum\nof 2% upon landing (Table 6-1); however, in two crewmembers from the\nshorterflights it increased by 4 or\n5%. The concentrationof sodium decreased a maximum of 3% in all but\ntwo crewmembers; the mean decrease\nwas significant. Decreasesin potassium concentration were generally\ngreater (up to 15%) and serum potassium decreased significantly in all\ncrewmen. Chloride concentrationincreased slightly in most crewmen.\nSerum calcium increased a maximum of\n9% in all crewmen, a significant\nchange. Inorganicphosphateincreased by 6-28% in five crewmen out of\neight (Table 6-1).\nMagnesium\ndecreasedin all but two individuals.\n\nFor STS-1, -2, -3 and -4, twentyfour-hour urine pools were collected\n30 days before flight (F-30). They\nwere also collected on Landing Day\n(L+O) (STS-1, -2 and -3) or on day\nfour after landing (L+4) (STS-4).\nThe sampleswere analyzed for volume,\nspecific gravity,osmolality,sodium,\npotassium,chloride, calcium, magnesium, phosphate,uric acid, creatinine, cortisol, aldosterone, anti-\n\nBlood urea nitrogen values on day L+O\nhad increased considerablyover preflight control levels in all but one\ncrewman, in whom it remained the\nsame; whereas uric acid decreased in\nall but two crewmembers(Table 6-1).\n\n24\n\nTable 6-1\nSerum or Plasma Biochemistry and Endocrinology\nApollo Immediately\nPostflight\nMean % Change from\nParameter\nPreflight\nNumber of Crewmember_\n33\n\nr_\n_m\n\nOsmolality\nNa\nK\nC1\nCa\nMg\nIPO\n4\nUric Acid\nBUN\nCreatinine\nGlucose\nTriglycerides\nCholesterol\nHDL Cholesterol\nLDL Cholesterol\nVLDL Cholesterol\nChol/HDL Risk\nLDL/HDL Risk\nTotal Bilirubin\nALT\nAST\nAlkaline Phosphatas_\nCPK\nGGTP\nLDH\nT3\nT4\nTSH\nInsulin\nHGH\nAngiotensin I\nAldosterone\nCortisol\nACTH\n*Statistically\n\nsignificant\n\nSkylab Inflight\nASTP Immediately STS-1-4 Immediately STS-1-4 Several Days\nDay 3,4\ni\nPostflight\nPostflight\n(3-5) Postflight\nMean% Change from Mean % Change from Mean% Change from\nMean % Change from\nPreflight\nPreflight\nPreflight\nPreflight\n9\n3\n8\n8\n\n-0.7\n-0.4\n-7.3\n-0.6\n1.0\n-5.0\n0\n-14,8\n11.9\n8.3\n9.8\n-24.3\n-6.0\n\n-0.6\n-1.5\n3.6\n-0.9\n6.5\n11.7\n4.3\n4.2\n\n12.5\n\n-I0.i\n-1\n12\n\n-27\n-24\ndifferences\n\n0.5\n-I.0"\n-8.9*\n1.3\n5.4*\n-2.1\n5.3\n-6.3\n19.1\n8.3\n24.3*\n-18.4\n1.6\n1.6\n4.6\n-17.9\n-0.I\n1.4\n12\n-2.1\n-13\nII\n37.6\n18\n21.9\n2.8\n22*\n21\n183"\n63\n142.0\n48.6*\n1.5\n72.3\n\n-49\n169\n33\n24\n-16\n\n-4.2\n2.8\n-11.3\n\n32\n304\n488\n\n-0.7\n-0.7\n-1.8\n-1.6\n0.8\n-3.2\n5.7\n-9.0\n30\n22\n-0.4\n3.6\n-5.7\n\n48.5\n\n-9.1\n52.1\n135.3\n-4.7\n-7.5\n-58.3\n- Preflight\n\n160\n8.0\n221\n12.9\n19.9\n\nvs Immediately Postflight\n\n(t-test)\n\n0.6\n0.2\n-2.6\n0.9\n1.8\n9.3\n0.5\n-12\n-7.0\n-0.6\n-1.9\n-28.1\n-10.8\n\n-23\n-0.9\n-0.8\n5.0\n-i0.I\n1.5\n7.8\n-3.5\n10\n-9.1\n34\n-I.0\n53.6\n25.6\n16.6\n-1.6\n\nBlood glucose and triglycerides\ndecreased in all but one person.\nTotal\nand LDL cholesterol\nincreased in all\ncrewmembers on the shorter\nflights\nbut decreased in all crewmembers on\nthe longer flights.\nVLDL cholesterol\ndecreased in all but one crewman, and\nHDL cholesterol\nvaried considerably\nto result in a mean increase of 1.6%.\n\nthe most consistent\nblood chemistry\nfinding\nat this\ntime point\n(Table\n6-I).\nBy several days postflight\ncholesterol,\nwhich had been higher\nin\nshort-flight\ncrewmembers and lower in\nlong-flight\ncrewmembers than it was\npreflight,\nhad decreased below the\npreflight\nvalue in all crewmembers.\nGlucose and triglycerides\nwere below\npreflight\nlevels in all but one crewmember.

Some of them may have\nactually lost more weight than the\ndata indicate and the one who apparently gained weight may not have\nactually gained, because of their\ningestionof fluids before the first\npostflightweighing. Astronauts who\nparticipated in the Apollo flights\nlost an average of 5% of preflight\nbody weight. Part of the STS crewmembers\' weight loss is due to loss\nof fluids but, as in other flight\nseries,there is evidence for loss of\nlean body mass. IncreasedBUN serum\nand creatininecan be associatedwith\nincreased protein catabolism. Anabolism may begin to increase immediately upon return from space; decreased excretion of uric acid may\nreflectthis occurrence.\n\nResults indicate that body fluids\nwere decreased on return to normal\ngravity. Plasma osmolalityincreased\nand serum protein and hematocritwere\nsignificantly increased over preflight values (see "Hematological\nand\nImmunologicalAnalysis"). The consistentlyincreasedBUN postflightis\nfurther evidence of a body fluid\nloss. Sodium and potassium had decreased but chloride had increased,\nsuggesting this change may not be\naldosterone-mediated. A few days\nafter landing, electrolytes had returned to normal except that potassium remained slightly lower than\npreflight values.\nImmediate postflight increases in plasma and urinary aldosterone, which stimulates\nsodium retention, indicate that a\nprocess of fluid and electrolyte\nconservation had been initiated,\nprobablyat about the time of landing\nsince in Skylab crewmembers during\nflight aldosteroneconcentrationwas\nlower than preflight levels. Serum\npotassiumdecreasesreflect potassium\nloss from the body during flight,\nprobably via aldosteronemechanisms,\nIncreased plasma angiotensin also\ncorrelates with increased aldosterone. Excretionof sodium, potassium\nand chloride was decreased on landing, again indicatingconservationof\nelectrolytes. This occurred in spite\nof ingestion by some crewmembersof\nGatorade (sugar solution containin\n9\na low concentrationof electrolytes)\nor other liquids and salt before or\nimmediately after landing. Several\ndays after landing, the hormones\nwhich respond to fluid and electrolyte changes (aldosterone, cortisol\nand angiotensin)continued to indicate a responseto space flight,\n\nBone MineralLoss\nAs in other flight series,serum calcium and phosphatewere increasedon\nlandingday, indicatingloss of these\nminerals from tissues during flight.\nHowever, excretion of calcium and\nphosphate decreased on landing day,\nperhaps another indicationof conservation of minerals when the flight is\nover or of a lower intake.\nStress\nThe plasma indicatorsof stress consistently indicated a hormonal response to mission conditions. The\ntissue enzymes CPK, LDH, and GGTP\nwere increased in serum, whereas CPK\nand LDH had decreased in the Apollo\ncrewmen after two weeks of flight.\nDifferences in the isoenzyme pattern\nfor LDH have been described above,\nbut in general, except in relationto\ndramatic clinical conditions, isoenzyme patterns are of little value in\nidentifying the tissue responsible\nfor increasedserum LDH (37). Immediately after landing, plasma cortisol, ACTH and aldosterone were at\nlevels higher than preflight, and\nexcretion of aldosterone, cortisol,\nepinephrine,and norepinephrinewere\nincreased.\n\nWeight Loss\nAll but one of the STS crewmembers\nexperiencedthe expected weight loss\n(1-4%) during flight. After landing\nall crewmembers began to regain the\n\n30\n\nThese data suggest that the Shuttle\nlandingswere more mentally and physically stressful than landings from\nApollo flights because of the increase in both serum enzymes and\nurine epinephrine concentration,\nDuring the postflighttesting period,\nparameterswhich could relate to diet\nand stress generallyreturnedto preflight values,\n\n(usually about noon) different from\nthat for collection of other specimens may also have affected results.\nThe increase in plasma cortisol, for\nexample, may actually have been\ngreater than the data indicate because the peak in circadianrhythm of\nthis hormone occurs early in the\nmorning, close to the time when preflight specimenswere obtained (42).\n\nOther MetabolicChanges\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nHGH has been increased in plasma of\ncrewmembers of all space flight\nseries compared here. Its secretion\nis usually stimulatedby hypoglycemia\nand it causes blood glucose to increase. Increase of the hormone on\nday L+O was associatedwith increased\nblood glucose. Bedrest also results\nin glucosemia(38), possibly because\ninactivemuscle cells take up glucose\nat a low rate (39). Insulinwas also\nincreased postflight. The reasons\nfor increasedplasma HGH and insulin\nat the same time are unclear.\n\nAs with any operationalmedical report, numerous individualscontributed significantlyto this work. The\nauthor would like to thank the\nShuttlecrewmen,the NASA flight surgeon and the staff of the NASA-JSC\nBiomedicalLaboratories,\nwho were responsible for the collection and\nanalysisof specimens.\n\nDecreases in plasma uric acid are\nunusual and could be related to a\nchange in the renal mechanism responsible for return of this metabolite\nto the systemic circulationor to the\nuricosuriceffectsof cortisol or the\nrelationship of LDH to uric acid\n(40). Increased BUN and creatinine\nmay also indicate changes in r.enal\nfunction. Soviet investigatorshave\nalso presented evidence (41) that\nminor alterations in renal function\noccur during space flight.\nPossible Sourcesof Error\nIn reviewing the postflight data,\ndifferences among treatment of each\ncrew during the immediate postflight\nactivity (for example, ingestion of\nlarge amounts of fluids sometimes\ncontaining glucose and electrolytes)\nbefore acquisitionof blood and urine\nspecimens must be remembered.

A unique and\nhighly sensitive modification\nof the\nApollo and Skylab methodology\nwas\nused for the first\ntime with the STS\nsamples.\nWith this technique,\naliquots of lymphocytes were incubated\nwith the mitogen phytohemagglutinin\nfor 60, 72, 84, or 96 hours at a\nconcentration of I, 2, 5, I0, 25, 50,\nor I00 mg of mitogen per millimeter\nof culture.\nIn this way, response\ncurves relating\n3W thymidine uptake\nboth to incubatiod\'time\nand to mitogen concentration could be constructed. The lymphocyte response was then\ntaken to be represented by the maximumcount per I0 minutes at the optimumincubation time and optimum mitogen concentration,\nminus the background count for the control\nwhich\nwas incubated for the same length of\ntime (without mitogen),\n\nCellular\n\nBlood Components\n\nThe postflight\nalterations\nin the\nnumber of the major leukocyte\ncomponents are presented in Table 7-5.\nThe total\nnumber of neutrophils\nin\nthe peripheral\nblood of all astronauts were increased postflight.\nIn\ncontrast,\nthe numbers of lymphocytes\nand eosinophils\nwere decreased postflight.\nThis noted decrease in the\nlymphocyte number did not numerically\naffect\nthe above mentioned loss of\nlymphocyte\nfunction\nas all\nblast\ntransformation\nanalyses\nwere conducted on lymphocyte populations\nof\nthe same density.\n\nCellular\nimmunology analyses\nwere\nconducted on blood collected\nwith\nsodium heparin\nwhereas ethylenediaminetetraacetic\nacid (EDTA) was\nthe anticoagulant\nof choice for the\ncellular\nhematology measurements.\nHumoral evaluations were conducted on\nserum from standard clot tubes.\nIn\nall cases, Vacutainer (TM) tubes were\nused for blood collection.\nThe blood\ncollection\nand distribution\nschedule\nis presented in Table 7-1.\n\nThe postflight\nalterations\nin the\nnumbers of major erythrocyte\nindicators\nare presented\nin Table 7-6.\nErythrocyte\nconcentrations\nincreased\nin the postflight\nperipheral blood of\ncrewmembers I through 4.

One\nphenomenon is manifested by a decrease in in vitro lymphocytefunction and in vivo alterationsin the\nnumbers of-_ajo-_o-r-leukocyte\ncomponents\nin the peripheralblood. For simplicity this will be referred to as the\nleukocyteresponse. The second phenomenon, referred to as the erythrocyte response, involved postflight\nchanges in the number and size of\nerythrocytes,numbers of circulating\nreticulocytes,\nand plasma-cellvolume\nbalance.\nAlthough all of these\nfactors are interconnected(and are\ninfluencedby many physiological\nprocesses not herein discussed) they\nwill be evaluated in terms of the\nresultanton either the leukocyticor\nerythrocyticcomponent of peripheral\nblood. A summary of our space flight\nexperience with these systems is\noutlined in Table 7-7.\nThe LeukocyteResponse\nThe postflightleukocyte response of\nAmerican astronauts and of Soviet\ncosmonautshas been studied by various methods for more than a decade,\nAnalyses conducted throughout the\neleven flightsof the AmericanApollo\nprogram failed to demonstrate any\npostflight alteration in RNA or DNA\nincorporation in response to phytohemagglutinin (PHA) exposure, although a postflightlymphocytosis\nwas\nreported for a majority of the 33\n\n43\n\ncrewmembers (1,2). The technique\nused for lymphocyteisolationduring\nthe Apollo series has been shown to\nselectivelyremove B lymphocytesand\na subset of T lymphocytes prior to\nculture (3,4) and may have contributed to the inability to demonstrate\nalterations. Similarly, the postflight functional capacity of crew\nlymphocytes,\nmeasured in terms of DNA\nproduction in response to PHA, was\nreported unchanged following the\nthree American Skylab visits (5).\nHowever, postflight RNA production\nwas reported to have been depressed\nconcomitantwith an increase in leukocyte absolute count (5,6). Variable lymphocyteresponsesto a variety of mitogens, as well as absolute\nleukocytes were reported among the\nparticipating astronauts following\nthe US-USSR joint Apollo-SoyuzTest\nProject (ASTP) Flight (7). It is not\npossible to attach any space flightrelated importance to the resulting\ndata because the astronauts were\nexposed to toxic levels of nitrogen\ntetroxideupon landing.\nAlterationsin the in vitro response\nof cosmonautlymphocyteswere reported followingthe flights of Soyuz 6,\n7, 8 and 9 (8,9). Although 3H uridine uptake was estimated by photographic film exposure, and the results were variable, these analyses\ngave an early indicationthat lymphocyte activity may be depressed following space flight. Comparative\npre- and postflightmeasurementsof\nperipherallymphocyteand total leukocyte numbers were taken for these\nmissions as well as for the Soyuz 11\nvisit to the Salyut 1 space station\nand the Soyuz visits to the Salyut 4\nspace station. Although resultswere\nquite variablean impressionis given\nof a postflightleukocytosisconcurrent with a postflight lymphocytopenia (10-12). In addition, a "...\ndiminished(postflight)\nreactivityof\nT lymphocytes..."\nwas reported after\nboth the 30-day and the 63 day visit\nto the Salyut 4 space station (10).\n\nTABLE 7-7 -

both\nthe\nspontaneous\nlymphocyte\nactivity\nand the maximum\nPHA-induced response.\nSince the data\nwere converted\nto a Stimulated\nIndex\na decrease\nin lymphocyte\nreactivity\nwas reported\n(13).\n\nHowever, there\nmay be some indirect\neffects\nas in the case of the stress\nproduced by trying\nto maintain\npositional\nequilibrium\nin the absence of\na significant\ngravitational\nvector.\nTherefore,\nit is most logical\nto assume that\nthe noted postflight\ndecrease in "T" lymphocyte\nactivity\nis\ncaused by conventional\nstressors,\nas\ndescribed\nby Selye (22) and has no\ndirect\nconnection\nto the hypogravity\nstate.\nThis analysis\nshould in no\nway be used to suggest that the noted\nresponse\nis unimportant\nto space\nflight.\nRegardless\nof the affectors\ninvolved,\nthe decrease in blastogenic\nresponse represents\nan indication\nof\na major change (or changes)\nin the\nimmune mechanism(s)\nduring\nspace\nflight.\nThe phenomenon\ndeserves\nthorough\ninvestigation\nduring\nfuture\nShuttle\nmissions.\n\nAnalysis\nof the results\npresented\nin\nTable 7-4 indicates\nthat the in vitro\nlymphocyte\nresponse\nto the mitogen\nphytohemagglutinin\nwas always reduced\nfollowing\nthe\nfirst\nfour\nShuttle\nflights.\nAlthough\nthe crewmembers\nare ranked,\nfor the sake of anonymity,\nin order of the magnitude of the\nresponse,\nthis\norder\nclosely\ncoincides\nwith\nthe mission\nsequence,\nCrewmembers one through\nfour\nrepresent\nthe crews from the first\ntwo\nShuttle\nspace flights.\nAlthough both\nof these missions\nlasted\nfor only 35\norbits\n(STS I = 54 hrs, 21 min.;\nSTS\n2 : 54 hrs.,\n13 min.) they contained\nthe most stressing\nsituations.\nCrewmembers 5 and 6 flew on the 129 orbit\n(192 hrs.,\n5 min.)\nSTS 3 flight,\nCrewmembers 7 and 8 comprised the 112\norbit\n(169 hrs.,\nII min.)\nSTS 4 crew\n(Table 7-1) and are generally\nconsidered to have been subjected\nto the\nleast\namount\nof inflight\nstress.\nTherefore,\nif\none remembers\nthat\nevaluations\nof the degree of stress\nexperienced\nin the mission\nis based\non subjective\nevidence,\nthis\nfactor\nmay be shown to relate\ndirectly\nto\nthe degree of loss in blast\ntransformability.\n\nAnalysis\nof the postflight\nnumerical\nchanges experienced\nwithin\nthe population\nof circulating\neosinophils\nand\nlymphocytes\n(as demonstrated\nin Table\n7-5)\nsupport\nthe\nhypothesis\nthat\nstress\nis important\nas an affector.\nGranulocytes\nare sequestered\nin, and\ndynamically\nbalanced between a circufating\ngranulocyte\npool (CGP) and a\nmarginal\ngranulocyte\npool\n(MGP).\nNormally the pools are of about equal\nsize (23),\nalthough\nan imbalance has\nbeen shown to result\nfrom a variety\nof stress-inducing\nsituations.\nFor\nexample, it has long been known that\nexercise\nand/or excitement\ngive rise\nto an increased\nleukocyte\ncount\n(23,24)\nas does acute anoxic\nanoxia\n(25), pain, nausea, vomiting,\nanxiety\n(26)\nand increased\nsteroid\nlevels\n(27).\nThe resulting\nneutrophilia\nreflects\ndemargination\nof cells\n(that\nis, release\nfrom walls of postcapillary venules)\nand is generally\nquite\ntransitory\n(23).\nAlthough\nthere\nis\ngenerally\na diurnal\nvariation\nin the\nbalance between the two granulocyte\npools\n(23) the magnitude\nof such a\nchange would\nnot account\nfor\nthe\nnoted\npostflight\nincreases\n(Table\n7-5).\n\nReduction\nin the ability\nof lymphocytes to respond to the mitogen PHA\nhas been reported\nto result\nfrom ingestion\nof certain\ndrugs (14), therreal trauma\n(15),\nviral\ninfections\n(16),\nprolonged\nexercise\n(17),\nbereavement\n(18),\nsleep\ndeprivation\n(19),\nradiation\nexposure (20),\nanxiety,\ndepression,\nand life\nchange\nstress\n(21).\nAt this time we have no\nreason to believe\nthat\nreduced gravity\ndirectly\naffects\nblastogenesis.\n\n45\n\nAs opposed to the neutrophil\nresponse, stress generally results in a\nsequestering\nof eosinophils\nin the\nreticuloendothelial\nsystem and is\ntherefore associated with a decrease\nin the circulating\npool (28).\nThis\nphenomenon is consistent\nwith the\npostflight\nloss of circulating\neosinophils as illustrated\nin Table 7-5.\nSuch a response has long been associated with increases in various affectors such as adrenal steroids\nand\nACTH (29,30) which were associated,\nseveral decades ago, with a simultaneous reduction\nin eosinophils\nand\nlymphocytes and a rise in neutrophils\n(31).\nThe Erythrocyte\n\nindicated by the increase in hematocrit.\nConversely, the STS 3 and 4\ncrewmembers demonstrated a postflight\ndecrease in the number of circulating\nerythrocytes\nand an increase in the\nmean corpuscular\nvolume.\nFor crewmembers 7 and 8 (STS 4) the MCV was\nhigh enough to affect an increase in\nthe hematocrit.\nThe decreases in red cell mass which\nhave previously been reported were at\none time thought to be the results of\nan intravascular\nhemolysis, triggered\nby a failure\nto maintain osmotic balance in an hyperoxic breathing atmosphere (32,33).\nNevertheless,\nsubsequent studies with Apollo and Skylab\n[2,5,34)\ncrewmembers led investigators to speculate that the loss may\nnot be due to erythrocyte\ndestruction\nbut to a reduction in the production\nof cells without compensatory erythropoiesis\n(2).\nWhatever the mechanIsm, it is evident from the data summarized in Table 7-6 that the phenomenon is still\nwith us. Active experimentation leading to the elucidation\nof this\nmechanism seems to be in\norder.\n\nResponse\n\nThe data presented\nin Table 7-6\nillustrate\nthat the STS-I and 2 crewmembers experienced a postflight\nincrease in the number of peripheral\ncirculating\nerythrocytes\nwith a simultaneous decrease in mean corpuscular volume. This response, which is\ngenerally opposite to that which was\nreported to occur following\nApollo\n(2) and Skylab (5) missions,\nwas\nlikely\nthe result\nof fluid\nloss as\n\nReferences\nI.\n\n2.\n\n3.\n\nphytohemagglutinin\nand pokeweed\nmitogens.\nCell Immunol. 6:2540.\n\nFischer,\nC.L.,\nJ.C.

Pierson,\n\nCHAPTER\n8\n\nPh.D.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nThe first\nflight\nof the Columbia\nbegan the era of reusable spacecraft.\nThis concept introduced\nadditional\nconcerns for the health and safety of\nthe crewmembers.\nThe potential\nbuildup\nof microorganisms\non the\ninterior\ncomponents of the Orbiter\nnecessitated the implementation of an\neffective\nmicrobial\ncontamination\ncontrol plan.\n\nSpacecraft\n\nSample Collection\n\nMicrobiology monitoring of the spacecraft was comprised of collecting\nand\nanalyzing samples from the Orbiter\'s\ninterior\nsurfaces,\nwaste management\nsystem, flight\nhardware, cabin air\nand potable water supply.\nCalcium\nalginate\nswabs were utilized\nto\nsample 21 surface sites\nthroughout\nthe mid- and flight\ndecks.\nSamples\nwere collected\nat F-30, F-2 and L+O.\nSampling techniques\nand analytical\nprocedures\nare described\nin the\n"Microbial\nSample Collection\nHandbook-OFT."\nThe designated areas (25\ncm ) were sampled using two phosphate\nbuffer-moistened\nswabs. One swab was\nplaced in trypticase\nsoy broth for\nbacterial\nculturing,\nand the other\nswab was placed in yeast malt broth\nwith antibiotic\nfor isolation\nof\nfungi.\nSamples were placed on appropriate\nmedia for quantitation\nand\nidentification.\n\nDuring the Orbital Flight Test (OFT)\n_hase of the Space Transportation\nystem (STS) program, the major objective\nof the Microbiology\nLaboratory\nwas the maintenance\nof the\nhealth and safety of the creva_embers,\nA pre- and postflight\nmicrobial analsis of the crewmembers and the\nrbiter\nwas conducted for each OFT\nflight.\nAn assessment of the patterns and extent of microbial\ncontamination\nof the Orbiter\nwas completed\nat the conclusion\nof each\nmission,\nMATERIALS\nANDMETHODS\n\nThe microbial\ncontent of the air in\nthe Orbiter was determined by using a\nsmall, portable centrifugal\nair sampler.\nCabin air was drawn into the\ndrum by an impeller\nblade assembly\nand the microorganisms present in the\nair impinged upon the surface of a\nflexible\nagar strip lining the inside\nof the drum. The nutrient-containing\nagar strip was incubated for 48 hours\nat 25\xc2\xb0C for bacterial\nquantitation.\nIncubation\nwas continued for seven\ndays for fungal quantitation.\n\nCrew Sample Collection\nSamples were collected\nfrom each\ncrewman for microbial\nevaluation\nat\napproximately\nF-30, F-IO, F-2, L+O,\nand L+5. Samples were taken from the\nfollowing\nareas:\nears,\nnose and\nthroat;\na fecal\nspecimen (or rectal\nswab) and a mid-stream\nfirst-void\nurine\nspecimen.\nThe samples were\nobtained by Microbiology\nLaboratory\npersonnel as well as the flight\nsurgeon (rectal\nswab) and delivered\nto\nthe laboratory\nfor analyses.\n\nSamples were collected\nfrom the\nOrbiter\'s\npotable water supply following servicing for flight\nand again\nat F-3.\nTests for total\nbacteria\nquantitation\nand for the presence of\ncoliforms,\nfungi and anaerobic bac49\n\nteria were performed on these samples. All microorganisms isolated\nfrom the potable water supply were\nanalyzed in the laboratory for specificidentification,\n\nborne microbes were not exceeded.\nThe increase in the number of crewmembers from two to six during the\noperationalphase of STS will greatly\naugment the potential for microbial\ncross-contamination among crewmembers; thus, careful monitoring will\ncontinue.\n\nRandom samples of all foodstuffs\nstored onboard the Orbiter were\nanalyzed to assure that acceptable\nmicrobial levels were not exceeded.\nThe analyticalproceduresand microbiologicalstandardshave been established for both non-stabilized and\nthermostabilized oods,\nf\n\nCrew Virology\nThe crewmembers\'immunitiesto specific viral agents were determined by\nserologicalanalyses. Serum samples\nwere screened for the hepatitis B\nsurface antigen and antibody to the\nhepatitis A virus. No evidence of\ninfection (prior or current) was\nfound in any of the crewmembers. In\naddition,all crewmembersdemonstrated sufficient immunity to rubella,\nrubeolaand mumps viruses.\n\nRESULTSAND DISCUSSION\nCrew Microbiology\nAll crewmembers exhibited normal\nmicrobialflora in ears, nose, throat\nand fecal cultures. Table 8-1 lists\nthe medically important microorganisms isolated from the crew samples\nduring the OFT missions. A variety\nof potential bacterial and fungal\npathogens were isolated from the\ncrewmembers during the sampling\nperiod,but no overt clinical manifestations resulting from these\nmicroorganismsoccurred. All fecal\nspecimenswere microscopicallyexamined for ova and parasites;no evidence of parasitic infection was\nfound in any sample obtained during\nthe OFT phase,\n\nSpacecraftMicrobiology\nThe spacecraft environment was further evaluated by collectingand analyzing air samples from both the\nmid-and flight decks. Quantitative\nresults of both preflight and postflight measurements are shown in\nTable 8-1. Only the bacterial results are included, but the fungal\nanalysis was similar. A rather significant increase in the numbers of\nairbornemicroorganisms\noccurred during the STS-1 preflightsamplingperiods. This increase was believed to\nhave resulted from the temporary installationof a blower in the cabin\nprior to launch. This blower was not\nutilized on subsequent flights. A\nsignificant increase in airborne\nmicrobes occurred during STS-2, however, this inflight buildup was not\nobserved during the STS-3 and 4\nflights.\n\nCross-contamination of crewmembers\noccurred during some Apollo missions\nand the possible consequences made\ncarefulmonitoringof the crewmembers\nan importantaspect of the Microbial\nContamination\nControl Plan. No evidence for cross-contamination of\ncrewmembersduring OFT was recorded,\nHowever, it was demonstratedduring\nSTS-3 that the microbes present in\nthe cabin air at landingwere isolated from the upper respiratorytract\nof crewmembers. The microbes were\nnot recovered from the crewmembers\nprior to the flight. This indicated\nthe need for careful monitoring of\nthe air to assure safe levels of air-\n\nTwenty-onesurface sites on the midand flight decks were sampled at\nF-30, F-2 and L+O. The F-30 sample\nallowed an assessmentof the cleanup\nprocedures used by ground personnel\nbetween flightsand the determination\nof the Orbiter\'s flight readiness.\n50\n\nIiII\n"/_/._/_ PREFLIGHT(F-2)\nPREFLIGHT (F-30)\n\nn"\n\n_\nw-\'\'\'\n\n400 1\n\nn-\n\n300\n\n_:\n_:\nz_\n\n2oo _\n\nw\n(3.\no0\n\nI\n\n-._\n\n>- 100/ I--"\n-! !-\n\nL_-\'---__\nI_l\n.\n1\n\nPOSTFLIGHT(L=0)\n\n__-_=- [\ni\nI\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n- _- _"\n_l == _l\n\n[]\xe2\x80\xa2I_\n\nz\no\no\n\n\xc2\xb0\n\nIllllllllllll\n\n2\n\n_I_ _I\nai\nm_=\n3\n\n4\nSTS MISSION\n\nFigure8-1.-Quantitation airborne\nof\nbacteria\nduringOFT.\n\n51\n\nI\nI\nI\n\nI\n\nSamples were taken at F-2 and L+O to\nobtain baseline preflight\nlevels and\nend of mission levels,\nrespectively,\nThe extent of microbial\nbuildup at\nspecific\nsites\nduring\nthe flight\ncould then be determined.\nMost sites\nexhibited a pronounced buildup during\nthe flight.\nNevertheless,\nthe bacteria\nlevels\ndissipated\nsharply by\nthe time of the F-30 certification\nsampling for the subsequent flight.\nThis reduction in numbers of microorganisms is the result of either the\ncleanup procedures between flights\nor\nthe natural decline of microbes in an\nunfavorable environment.\nDuring the\nfirst\nfour\nflights\nnone of the\nselected sample sites maintained a\nhigh residual level of microorganisms\nfrom flight\nto flight,\n\nIn addition to the inflight\nbuildup\nof microorganisms at various interior\nsites,\na variety\nof medically\nimportant microbes were isolated\nfrom the\nOrbiter\'s\ninterior\n(Table 8-2).\nMost\nof the potential\npathogens were fungi\nwith Aspergillus being the predominant genus isolated.\nPotable Water Microbiology\nThe Orbiter\'s\npotable water was sampled after\nservicing,\nat F-3 and\nagain at L+O.

During the STS-4 preflight\nperiod, all food was weighed for each\ncrewman and nutrient intake was determined using a computerized USDA\ndata base. During the STS-4 flight,\nthe crew kept a log of their food\nintake. All flight foods were analyzed in the Medical Sciences Laboratory at JSC.\n\nFrozen sandwiches were prepared in\nthe JSC Food Facility\nand shipped to\nthe Kennedy Space Center (KSC) for\nSTS-1, 2 and 3. Water was placed in\ntwo flight\nbeverage packages the\nnight before launch and refrigerated,\nThe water and frozen sandwiches were\nplaced in each astronaut\'ssuit pocket on launch morning for their first\ninflight snack. The sandwicheswere\nto be consumed within six hours of\nlaunch or discarded. For STS-4, ham\nsandwiches were prepared at KSC on\nthe morning of launch, placed in polyethylene zip-lock bags and kept refrigerateduntil they were placed in\nthe astronaut\'s suit pockets. An\napple was also stowed in the suit\npocket on STS-4.\n\nIn support of fluid loading as a\ncountermeasure to deconditioning,\nfour additionaleight ounce beverages\nper crewman were provided for the\nmorning of reentry on STS-3 and\nSTS-4. On STS-3, the crew consumed\nthe beverageson the day of scheduled\nreentry, which was 24 hours prior to\nactual landing. On STS-4, one gram\nsodium chloride tablets (eight per\ncrewman) were added. They consumed\ntwo salt tablets with each eight\nounce beverage.\n\nAn in-suit food bar was provided for\neach astronauton all flightsfor use\nin case of an extra vehicular activity (EVA), but these were not used\nduring the OFT missions.\nA small experimental freezer was\nplaced onboard for the STS-4 mission,\nIt contained three servings of handpacked vanilla ice cream in the new\nsquare Shuttle package and one filet\n6O\n\nSandwichesand snacks were provided\npostflight for all crews on their\nreturn trip from the landing site to\nEllington,AFB, TX. Postflightfood\nservice was also provided for the\nprime crew immediately after touchdown at White Sands, N.M., for STS-3\nand at EdwardsAFB, CA. for STS-4.\nAlthough there was no requirementto\nmeasure inflight nutrient intake on\nthe first three missions, food\nconsumption was estimated from an\ninventory of food packages returned\neither unused in locker trays or empty in the trash. The food package\ninventory from STS-4 was compared\nwith the crew\'s onboard food log to\nmore accurately determine the inflight nutrient intake. Table 9-4\nlists the mean daily inflight nutrient consumption per person per OFT\nmission,\nProblems encountered during the\nflights which impacted the food\nsystem were as follows:\nSTS-1\n\nThe pantry was packed too\ntightly and it was difficult to restowthe food\npackages once they were\nremoved,\n\nSTS-2\n\nThe water flow was slow\nand there was excessive\ngas in the water system.\n\nSTS-3\n\nFive beverage packages\nfailed due to an inadequate heat seal. Problems\nwere encounteredrestowing\nunused food packages because they kept floating\nout of the locker tray.\n\nSTS 1,2,3,4Interruptionof meal periods by Mission Control\ncontributedto a decreased\nfood consumption because\nthe crews did not have\ntime to eat at the scheduled meal periods.\n\n61\n\nCONCLUDINGREMARKS\nThe OFT food system used a combination of Apollo and Skylab type food\npackages which served their purpose\nwell while an operationalfood system\nwas being developed. The new square\nShuttle packages for rehydratable\nfoods were evaluated on two of the\nmissions as a test demonstration.\nSince the new food package was designed to functionwith the galley,\nthe delay in the use of the galley\npromptedthe developmentof the portable food warmer which was used successfullyon all of the OFT missions.\nThe food warmer proved to be a valuable asset to the food system.\nThe OFT missions also providedan opportunity to evaluate a new concept\nin menu design for U.S. space missions. Previous space food systems\nused personal preference menus for\neach astronaut. Due to the logistics\ninvolved in providing personal preference menus, a standardfour-day\nmenu cycle was used on all Shuttle\nOFT missions with a pantry that accommodated personal preferences and\nalso served as a contingency food\nsupply. The standard menu/pantry\nconcept proved to be a workable solution to the logisticsproblemand was\naccepted by all crewmembers.\nIn general, all crews were satisfied\nwith the quality of the food and the\nperformanceof the preparationequipment.\n\nTable\n9-4_\n\nDaily\nInflight\nNutrient\nConsumption\nPerPersonerCFTMission\nP\n\nSTS\nDays RH,!)* NH20**KiloPro- Fat\nFlight\ngm\ngm caloriesrein gm\ngm\n\nCa\nmg\n\nPhos\nmg\n\nNa\nmg\n\nK\nmg\n\nIron Mg\nmg\nmg\n\nCu\nmg\n\nZn\nmg\n\nCl\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n1134\n\n3\n\n8\n\n1393\n\n353.0 1910\n\n66.1 49.6 280.2 885 1210 3010 PP44 16.6 229 1.6 1.9 10.1\n4407\n\n4\n\n7\n\n1710.8325.5 2446\n\n85.6 73.5 319.2 954 1474 3506 2558 2D.2 286 2.2 2.2 11.6\n4784\n\n88.4\n\n*R)+20\n; R_IKlration\nwater.\n*_FzO\n-Fbisture\ninfood.\n\n1100\n\n106.883.1 358.61210 1706 4506 3238 27.1 387\n\n_h\nmg\n\n1\n\no_\n\n_656\n\nCHO\ngm\n\n58.5 28.0 152.0 687\n\n916 1782 1362 12.4 154\n\n17.6\n9.4\n\nCABIN ACOUSTICAL OISE\nN\nJerry\n\nL.\n\nHomick,\n\nCHAPTER\n10\n\nPh.D.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nThroughout a major portion\nof the\nmanned space flight\nprogram, personnel at the Johnson Space Center (JSC)\nhave been involved in the specification of acceptable spacecraft\nnoise\nlevels,\nthe measurement of spacecraft\nnoise (both real and simulated)\nand\nthe assessment of spacecraft noise on\ncrew well-being\nand performance.\nOn\nthe basis of limited data it is known\nthat with a few minor exceptions the\nApollo, and especially\nSkylab, spacecraft\ninternal\nnoise environments\nwere within\nacceptable limits.\nThe\nambient acoustical\nnoise in these\nvehicles\nat no time presented\na\nhazard to the crewmen\'s hearing and\nseldom interfered\nwith their ability\nto effectively\ncommunicate, perform\nand obtain adequate sleep.\nIn order\nto preclude crew related acoustical\nnoise problems on future spacecraft\nthe JSC convened a committee in 1972\nwhich developed a standard set of\nacoustical\nnolse criteria\nfor spacecraft\ndesign.\nThis standard,\nJSC\nDesign and Procedures;\nStandard 145\n"Acoustical\nCriteria",\nspecifies\nmaximum allowable crew exposures to\nshort duration\nnoises (e.g.,\nlaunch\nnoise) and sustained on-orbit\nambient\nnoise.\nThe on-orbit\nmaximum allowable noise defined by Standard 145 is\n55 dB-A\n(A-weighted\ndecibals).\nFifty-five\ndB-A is approximately\nequivalent\nto an NC-50 (Noise Criteria)\nnoise contour.\nStandard 145\nwas applied as a design goal for the\nSpace Shuttle Orbiter.\n\nly imposed on them, reasonable cost\neffective\nmeasures were taken to\nlower the levels.\nPrototype GFE Inertial\nMeasurement Unit (IMU) mufflers\nwere developed\nand used in\nvehicle ground tests to measure their\neffectiveness\nin reducing\noverall\nnoise levels.\nThese mufflers\nwere\nupdated to a flight\nconfiguration\nfor\nOV-I02,\nbuilt-in\nacoustic\nblankets\nwere added to avionics bay closeouts,\nand crew installed\nacoustic blankets\nwere provided.\nFor operational\nvehicles,\nIMU mufflers\nand built,in\nacoustic\nblankets were approved for\nimplementation.\nEar plugs were provided for the flight\ncrew to wear, if\nsupplementary noise attenuation\nwas\nrequired.\nGround based noise tests\nperformed\non OV-I02 at Palmdale,\nCalifornia,\n(January 1979) and at\nKennedy Space Center (KSC) (May 1980)\nconfirmed that the internal\nOrbiter\nacoustic\nnoise did exceed Standard\n145 even with the various\n"fixes"\ninstalled.\nTo determine the extent\nof the Shuttle Orbiter acoustic noise\nproblem during actual flight,\na Detailed\nTest Objective (DTO) entitled\n"Cabin Acoustical Noise" was developed for implementation on STS-I.\nSimilar DTO\'s were developed for implementation on STS-2 and STS-4.\nThe objectives\nof these DTO\'s were to\nquantitatively\nmeasure the extent to\nwhich on-orbit\ncabin acoustical\nnoise\nmet or exceeded the levels defined by\nJSC Design and Procedural\nStandard\n145, and to ensure that noise levels\nwere operationally\nacceptable.\n\nAnalytical\nstudies performed by Rockwell in the mid to late 1970\'s indicated that the actual on-orbit\ninternal acoustical\nnoise\nenvironment\nwould exceed Standard 145.\nAlthough\nthe JSC specification\nwas not formal-\n\nMATERIALS\nANDMETHODS\nUsing a hand-held\nsound pressure\nlevel meter the STS-I crew made one63\n\nband and A-weighted sound level\nmeasurements at four locations on\nMission Day 1. The data were voice\nrecorded and transmitted to the\nground prior to the first inflight\nsleep period,\nUsing the same sound level meter used\non STS-1, the STS-2 crew made\nA-weighted sound level measurements\nat 12 predeterminedlocationson Mission Day 1. One octave band measurements were made at four of these\nlocations. The data were logged onboard in the Orbit OperationsChecklist and retrievedpostflight,\nThe noise environment on STS-1 and\nSTS-2 elicited mild complaints from\nthe crewmen. For this reason and in\norder to reduce stowage weight, the\nAcoustical DTO was deleted from the\nSTS-3 mission,\nFollowingthe STS-3 mission, data obtained from onboard Development\nFlight Instrumentation (DFI) microphones indicated the presence of a\nrelatively high intensity, low frequency noise, This was judged to be\npotentially hazardous to the crew\'s\nhearing, especially if it were not\n\ncorrectedfor STS-4 and became worse\ninflight. An investigationof 0V-102\nindicated that the noise was being\nproduced by a failing bearing in an\nIMU fan. The fan was replaced prior\nto STS-4 and subsequentground noise\nmeasurementsindicatedthat the problem was apparently corrected. In\norder to verify that the noise would\nnot reoccur in orbit and present a\npotential hazard to the crew, the\nCabin Acoustic Noise DTO was\nreassignedto STS-4.\nUsing a hand-held sound pressure\nlevel meter the STS-4 crew made oneoctave band and A-weighted sound\nlevel measurementsat two sleep locations on Mission Day 1. They were\ninstructedto report the data prior\nto the first sleep period only if the\nlevels exceeded 65 dB-A. Otherwise,\nthe data were to be logged and returned postflight. The crew was also\nasked to make measurementsat other\ndesignated locations if time permitted later in the mission.\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nThe data obtained from STS-1 are summarized in Table 10-1.

However, some temporary hearing threshold shifts\ncould be experienced.\nThese temporary\nshifts\ncould have\nsubtle effects\non speech communications and auditory\nsignal detection,\nIt was for this\nreason that\nJSC\nearlier\ndeveloped a guideline\nwhich\nrecommended that in spacecraft noise\nenvironments between 65 dB-A and 75\ndB-A hearing protection\ndevices be\nworn during sleep to permit recovery\nfrom noise induced temporary threshold shifts.\nDuring postflight\ncrew\n\nThe noise measurements made on STS-I,\nSTS-2 and STS-4 appear to adequately\ncharacterize\nthe acoustical\nnoise\nenvironment in the OV-I02 OFT configuration.\nSteps should be taken to\nensure that\nthe first\noperational\nconfiguration\nOrbiter\nand subsequent\nOrbiters\nhave acceptable\nlevels\nof\nacoustic\nnoise.\nIt is planned to\nmake measurements on the first\noperational Orbiter.\nIt will be determined whether this data can be obtained\nin ground based tests\nor whether\nadditional\non-orbit measurements must\nbe taken.\nEmphasis will\nbe placed\nnot only on repeating\nsome of the\nstandard\nflight\ndeck and mid-deck\nmeasurements, but also on repeating\nsome of the locations where unusually\nhigh levels were recorded.\n\n66\n\nRADIATION PROTECTION\nPROGRAM\n\nCHAPTER\n11\n\nD.

Sauer\nINTRODUCTION\nPotable water was provided for the\nOrbital\nFlight\nTest (OFT) crews by\nthe Shuttle\nOrbital\nPotable\nWater\nSystem.\nThe system is similar\nto\nApollo in that it consists mainly of\nfuel cells (which produce water as a\nby-product of producing electricity),\nwater storage tanks, a water dispenser, a water disinfection\ncapability\nand interconnecting\ntubing.\nIt differs from Apollo in that it is made\nof stainless\nsteel rather than aluminum and does not require crew involvement to provide water disinfection.\nRather than in Apollo, where a\nchlorine\nsolution\nwas added daily by\nthe crew to the water storage tanks,\nmicrobiological\ncontrol in Shuttle is\nprovided by a Microbial\nCheck Valve\n(MCV). The MCVcontinually\niodinates\nall water to the potable water tank\nto a level of 2-5mg/l and does not\nrequire any crew action.\nTo prevent\nback-contamination\nof the system, the\nOFT water dispenser\ncontains\nthree\nMCV\'s.\n\nwere analyzed\nShuttle\nFluid\nControl."\n\nper SE-0073, "Space\nProcurement\nand Use\n\nThroughout the OFT Program, the potable water system performed as expected with the exception of STS-2.\nDuring STS-2, a problem developed\nwith one of the fuel cells and it was\nshut down. The potable water tank was\nisolated from the system and was not\nused for the remainder of the mission\nfor fear it had become contaminated.\nAir in the potable water was another\nproblem encountered\nduring\nSTS-2.\nThe air was initially\nthought to be\nrelated to the fuel cell failure,\nbut\nlater\nwas determined to be a result\nof improper water system servicing\npreflight.\nSubsequent missions had no\nproblems with the water system.\nCONCLUSION\nProblems encountered on STS-2 (fuel\ncell failure)\nimpacted, but were not\ncaused by, the potable water system.\nAlthough some parameters occasionally\nwere above specification\nlimits,\nall\nwere minor excursions and none were\nconsidered harmful to the crew.\n\nDISCUSSION\nPeriodic\nsamples were obtained from\nthe potable water system to assure\nth_ continuing\nchemical and microbiological\nacceptability\nof the water.\nThese samples were obtained at\nthe time of servicing,\nbetween servicing and launch, three days prior to\nlaunch and at landing.\nAll samples\n\n72\n\nSHUTTLETOXlCOLOGY\nWayland J. Rippstein,\n\nCHAPTER\n13\nJr.\n\nThe toxicological\nsupport provided\nfor the Shuttle program has largely\nresulted from experience gained during NASA\'s previous space programs,\nmostly from the Apollo flights.\nIt\nwas during this period that a strong\nemphasis was placed on selection\nof\nnonmetallic materials.\nThe materials\nselection\nprogram included not only\nspacecraft materials\'\nevaluation from\nthe flammability\nand applicability\nstand points, but also the quantities\nof contaminants that might be outgassed into the cabin environment,\nOutgassed contaminants\nfrom Apollo\nnonmetallic materials resulted in the\ndetection and identification\nof over\n300 different\ncompounds. Strict\ncontrol\nhas to be maintained\non the\nkinds and quantities\nof compounds\nallowed in the cabin area if the crew\nwas to be safeguarded from potential\nhazards,\n\nsolely\n\nwith\n\ninhalation\n\ntoxicity.\n\nRFSULTSANDDISCUSSION\nFour major\nidentified:\n\nareas of\n\nimportance\n\nwere\n\no Establishment\nof\nspace\nflight\ntoxicity\nstandards.\no Establishment of a method for control\nand evaluation\nof candidate\nspacecraft\nmaterials\nselection\nand/or use.\no Development of methods and hardware\nfor removal of spacecraft contaminants.\no Development of methods for conducting measurements of spacecraft contaminant levels during missions.\nNew inhalation\nstandards\nwere required for space flight\nsince all\nexisting\ninhalation\ntoxicity\nstandards dealt with 40-hour work-week\nexposures, except for U.S. submarine\noperations.\nIn the case of submarine\noperations\nwhere atmospheric maximum\nallowable concentrations\nare reached,\nthe vessel could, in most cases, surface to vent contaminant gases. However, a spacecraft crew could not rid\nthe crew compartment of contaminant\ngases as readily\nas would be required.\nFor this reason the spacecraft\nmaximum allowable\nconcentration\n(SMAC) values for contaminant gases\nare in most cases from one-half\nto\none-tenth\nof the value set for\na\nstandard 40-hour week maximum allowable concentration\nvalue.\nA second\nand possibly equally important reason\nfor requiring\nthe setting\nof SMAC\nvalues at significantly\nlower levels\nthan is required for industry is that\nindustrial\nvalues are mainly based\nupon physiological\ncriteria\nwhile\nspacecraft\nvalues\nare based upon\ndecrement of performance (behavioral\nchanges) and physiological\ncriteria.\n\nThis same materials selection\nprogram\nwas adopted during the early phases\nof the development and manufacturing\nof the Shuttle\nOrbiter\nvehicles,\nOutgassing analyses were conducted on\nsuch Orbiter\nmaterials\nas heat exchanger fluids,\nthermal insulation,\npaints,\nfire\nextinguisher\nfluids,\nlubricants,\nadhesives,\nelectrical\nwire insulation,\nplastics,\nrubbers,\nand elastomers.\nSpecial\nattention\nwas placed on the evaluation\nof selected nonmetallic\nmaterials\non the\nbasis of their\ncombustion products,\nThese were also evaluated from both\nthe chemical composition and inhalation toxicity\nstandpoints,\nTwo other areas Qf support program\nhas been ingestion\nand contact toxicity\nassessments.\nHowever,\nthe\ngreatest number of toxicity\nproblems\nconcerning the Shuttle vehicles have\nbeen in the area of inhalation\ntoxicology.\nTherefore, this report deals\n73\n\nA list\nof known spacecraft\ncontaminant gases was submitted to an ad hoc\ncommittee of the National Acad_-_-y\no--6-f"\nSciences.\nThe committee was composed\nof governmental,\ninstitutional,\nand\nindustrial\ntoxicologists\nto established long-term, continuous exposure\nlimits\nfor space flight.\nThey recommended a list\nof SMACvalues to NASA.\nThese values were used in later activities\ninvolving\nspacecraft materials selection\nand the development of\nspacecraft breathing gas standards,\n\nlection\nprogram.\nThis effort\nconsisted mainly of the establishment of\na close working relationship\nbetween\nthe NASA toxicology\nscientists\nand\nARS design engineers.\nThe spacecraft\nARS design\nincorporated\nprovisions\nfor the removal of contaminant gases\nby three different\nmethods.\nThe primary method for removal of\ncontaminant\ngases is by adsorption\nonto a bed of activated\ncarbon that\nis contained in the ARS carbon dioxide (CO removal bed (lithium\n2)\nxide)\n\nWhen new gases (those not evaluated\nby the National Academy of Sciences)\nwere used in the Shuttle\nProgram,\ninhouse\nor\ncontracted\ntoxicity\nstudies were conducted to determine\nthe SMACvalue,\n\nhydro-\n\nThe second method for contaminant gas\nremoval is in a specially\ndesigned\ncanister known as the ambient temperature catalytic\noxidizer\n(ATCO!. The\nATCO was approved for use in the\nOrbiter for the purpose of catalytically converting trace quantities\nof\ncarbon monoxide (CO) into CO_. The\nCO would then be removed in _he CO\n2\n2\nscrubber portion of the ARS. Certain\nother\nlesser\nimportant\ncontaminant\ngases would also be catalytically\noxidized in the ATCO. These compounds\nwould then be adsorbed in the activated carbon beds contained both in\nthe ATCOand ARS.\n\nThe second phase of the Shuttle Toxicology Program was carried out by establishing\na materials selection\nprogram that included the evaluation\nof\nspacecraft\ncandidate nonmetallic\nmaterials\nfor outgassing\ncharacteristics.\nOutgassing analyses were conducted to determine both qualitative\nand quantitative\ninformation.\nA\ncriteria\nfor acceptance was established for all nonmetallic\nmaterials\nbased upon outgassing\ncharacteristics,\nspacecraft\nvolume,\nmission\nduration,\nSMAC values, and performance of the spacecraft\natmospheric\nrevitalization\nsystem (ARS).\n\nThe final\nmeans of contaminant gas\nremoval is in the spacecraft\nARS\ndehumidifier.\nThe cabin atmosphere\npasses over this moisturized\nsurface,\nwhere trace levels of water soluable\ncontaminants are carried out of the\ndehumidifier\nwith the effluent\nwater\nstream.\nThis part of the ARSwas not\ndesigned with this function\nin mind,\nbut its scrubbing effect\nis considered to be part of the overall\ncontaminant gas removal capability.\n\nA procedure was incorporated\nin the\nmaterials\nprogram for accepting certain critical\nhardware materials\nby\nuse of waivers.\nThis involved a review of hardware materials\nused in\nthe spacecraft.\nIn some cases, the\nreview required more thorough chemical and toxicological\ntesting of the\ncandidate\nspacecraft\nmaterials\nor\nhardware,\n\nThe last phase of the Shuttle Toxicol ogy Program concerns the methods\nused for assessing the trace atmospheric contaminants condition\nduring\nan actual mission.\nFrom previous experiences with assessments of closed\nenvironments in manned chamber tests\nand previous analyses of spacecraft\n\nThe third\npart of the overall\nToxicology Program involved the development of methods and hardware to control the levels of contaminant gases\nnot eliminated\nin the materials\nse-\n\n74\n\ncabin atmospheres, it was concluded\nthat two methods would be employed to\nobtain\na complete qualitative\nand\nquantitative\nanalyses of the Orbiter\natmospheres. These methods are known\nas whole- and adsorbed-gas-sampling\nprocedures;\n\nmination of the CO contained in the\natmospheric\nsample.\nCO is not adsorbed in the Tenax trap.\nThe major\nproblem in using the whole-gas-sampling procedure is that since only a\ngas is trapped in the sampling cylinder, some difficulty\nis experienced\nin attempting to identify\nvery small\nquantities\nof contaminant gases in\nthe sample.\nThe function\nof the\nTenax trapping procedure is important\nfor the overall\nanalysis of a spacecraft\ncabin atmosphere.\nSince the\nTenax trap can be used to continuously trap gases for 24 hours, large\namounts of contaminants can easily be\ncontained in the final\ntrapped sample.\nThis makes the qualitative\nprocess much easier to accomplish.\nBecause of the concentration\neffect,\nthe 24-hour sampling procedure permits the trapping\nof contaminants\npossibly\nmissed by the whole-gassampling method.\nOnce the compounds\nare identified,\nthe quantitative\nresults are determined using the whole\ngas samples.\n\nThe whole-gas-sampling\nprocedure used\nan evacuated stainless\nsteel cylinder\n(Figure 13-1).\nWhen a gas sample is\nrequired,\na valve on the evacuated\ncylinder\nis opened and an atmospheric\nsample is drawn into the cylinder.\nThe cylinder\nvalve is immediately\nclosed to trap the sample for later\nanalyses.\nThe adsorbed-gas-sampling\nprocedure involves\nthe use of the\nShuttle\nair sample assembly (Figure\n13-2).\nThis assembly consists\nof\nseven pairs\nof tubes containing\na\nsubstrate known as Tenax. Tenax has\nbeen found to be an excellent\nsubstance for the adsorption\nof most\nairborne contaminant gases, especially in the presence of water vapor,\nThe adsorptlon property of Tenax has\nbeen employed as a contaminant gas\nsampling media by drawing atmospheric\nsamples through small stainless steel\ntubes containing\na measured quantity\nof the white powder-like\nsubstance,\nAs the atmospheric samples are drawn\nthrough the Tenax bed of powder, the\norganic contaminant gases are retained while oxygen, nitrogen, argon, CO,\nCO^ and most water vapor pass directlyZthrough the bed with a minimum of\nadsorption.\nThe tubes are sealed\nafter\nthe specific\nsampling period\n(usually 24 hours of continuous sampling) and analyzed at a later time.\n\nAtmospheric\nsamples were obtained\nfrom the first\nfour\nSTS flights.\nFour whole-gas-sampling\ncylinders\nwere carried on STS-I through STS-3.\nDue to weight restrictions,\nonly one\nwhole-gas-sampling\ncylinder\nwas carried on STS-4.\nThe solid sorbent,\nShuttle\nair-sampling\nassembly was\nused for sample acquisition\non STS-1\nand STS-2.\nDue to technical\ndifficulties\nexperienced with the unit,\nthe device was not flown on STS-3 or\nSTS-4.\nThe samples obtained from all\nfour\nmissions have made possible excellent\nanalytical\nresults.\nOnly the analytical,\nqualitative\nand quantitative\naspects of returned samples are discussed under the heading of concluding remarks.\n\nThe application\nof both the wholeand adsorbed-gas-sampling\nprocedures\nprovides a high degree of accuracy in\nboth qualitative\nand quantitative\nassessment of spacecraft\ncabin atmospheres.\nThe whole gas samples provide accurate quantitative\ndeterminations of the contaminant gas contained in the cabin atmosphere at the\ntime of sampling\n(instantaneous).\nWhole gas samples also allow a deter-\n\nThe samples returned from the STS-1\nmission resulted\nin the identification of 56 compounds.

However, in the case of\nthe spacecraft flown for STS-1\nthrough STS-4, it was necessary to\nassess an atmosphere containing as\nmany as one hundred different contaminant gases.

These groupings include CT-aliphatic hydrocarbons, C8-alkane\',\nCR-olefinic hydrocarbons or CR-subs\'tituted\nbenzene,\nTable 13-1 contains a complete list\nof the compounds detected for the\nfour STS flights,\n\nexposures. These values were based\nupon the following\nset of criteria:\no Continuous exposure for 24 hours\nper day for up to seven days.\n\nIt is importantto recognizethe significant decrease in the number of\ncompounds detected in the STS-4 compared with those detected in STS-1\nthrough STS-3. Two importantfactors\nmay have contributed to this reduction. It was during the STS-4 mission that the ambient temperature\ncatalytic oxidizer was first used.\nSecondly,only one whole-gas-sampling\ncylinder was carried on STS-4. If\nmore samples had been obtained, a\ngreater number of componentsmay have\nbeen detected,\nThe reason for the presence of such a\nhigh concentrationof methane in the\nSTS-4 sample is not known. Samples\nreturned from future flights will\n\no ExposUre to a single contaminant\ngas.\no No other physiologicalthreat from\no_her stress factors, e.g., heat,\ncold, and work.\no Wherefor a given compound, a SMAC\nable toxicitydata were not availvalue was assigned for that compound, at a level equal to the toxicity value for the most toxic cornpound in the compound family.

The contribution\nof the other compounds in\nthe category of systemic poisons in\nconjunction with the 17 ppm for toluene (SMACvalue is 20 ppm) resulted\nin summation value\ngreater\nthan\nunity.\n\nDepending upon the concentration,\nthe\nexamples given in each of the above\nfive categories can in some cases be\nchanged from one grouping to another.\nIn order to arrive at an overall\nassessment where a very large number of\ncontaminant gases exist simultaneously in the cabin atmosphere, only the\nadditive\neffects\nin a given physiological\nresponse grouping have been\nconsidered.\nThe possibility\ndoes\nexist,\nhowever, for synergistic\neffects between compounds in different\ngroups or even with the same group,\nScientific\ninformation\ndoes not exist\nfor dealing with synergistic\neffects\nof the contaminants gases detected in\nthe Orbiter cabin,\n\nCorrective\nmeasures were taken immediately\nafter the over limit\nsituation was identified\nand reported.\nThese corrective\nmeasures were taken\nbetween the STS-2 and STS-3 missions.\nNASA materials\nand safety engineers\ndetermined that the toluene detected\non STS-2 had the highest probability\nof being introduced\ninto the cabin\natmosphere as the result\nof having\nused this solvent to clean spacecraft\ninterior\nsurfaces for the application\nof a fastening material known as Velcro.\nRestrictions\nwere placed on the\namounts of toluene allowed in the vehicle at any given time and the time\nof its use prior to launch.\n\nSince particulate\nmaterials\nare not\nmonitored in the Orbiter cabin, and\nsince the ARS contains a micro sized\nfilter,\nthis subject is not addressed\nin this report,\n\nIn conclusion,\nsignificant\ninformation\nhas been gained from the OFT\nflights\nthat\nallows greater\nconfidence in the appropriateness\nof the\nShuttle Toxicology Program.

Ferguson, Ph.D.\nA well-defined\nHealth Stabilization\nProgram was first\nintroduced into the\nspace program on the Apollo 14 mission.\nThe Program was put into effect following\na number of prime crew\nillnesses\nand exposures to persons\nwith communicable diseases.\nThese\nillnesses\nand exposures occurred at\ncritical\nmission times,\nimmediately\nbefore or during the earlier\nApollo\nmissions.\nAs a result of these occurrences,\nit was recognized\nthat\ncrew illnesses\ncould cause a loss of\nvaluable\ncrew training\ntime,\npostponement of missions, or even compromise crew safety and mission success.\nThe health program was therefore\nestablished\nto provide an environment\nsurrounding\nthe prime and backup\ncrewman which would reduce and hopefully eliminate their exposure to infectious disease.\n\nbuilding\nand crew quarters,\nand only\nprimary contacts were allowed to enter.\nThe participants\nwere instructed to wear surgical masks when within\nsix feet of a crewmember. Each primary contact was asked to voluntarily\nreport any illness\nto his or her site\nclinic\nand receive a medical examination.\nIf an infectious\ndisease was\nfound they were not allowed to return\nto the crew work area.\nCrew housing was required\nfor the\nprime and backup crewmen at the\nJohnson Space Center (JSC), Kennedy\nSpace Center (KSC), and Dryden Flight\nResearch Facility\n(DFRF) locations\nand only primary contacts\nwere allowed to enter.\nFood control\nand\nspecific\nsecurity\nmeasures\nwere\ncarried out.\nOn all\nsubsequent missions,\nSTS-2\nthrough STS-4, the Health Stabilization Program was altered to meet the\nneeds of the advancing Shuttle program.\nSecurity coverage was eliminated to remove the restrictions\nplaced on the work areas.\nThe objective of the new approach known as the\nLevel\nI program was to create\na\nhealth awareness among the personnel\nentering the crew work areas.\nPosters, signs and information\nsheets\nwere placed on the walls asking for\nvoluntary\ncompliance to the specific\nhealth\nrules.\nInformation\nsheets\nwere also distributed.\nBriefings\nwere given to the flight\ncrewmembers\nwith recommendations for illness\nprevention measures.\nSince work areas\nwere not restricted\nto primary contacts,\nspecial\ncrew travel\nroutes\nwere established\nto prevent accidental exposures.\nAll persons who were\nknown to have to be within\nsix feet\nof a crewmember during the seven days\nimmediately\nprior\nto launch were\nidentified\nas primary contacts\nand\n\nThe Apollo 14 Health Stabilization\nProgram was successfully\ncompleted\nwithout an illness\noccurrence in the\ncrewmen.\nFollowing\nthe Apollo\n14\nmission, the Program was effectively\nused for the remainder of the Apollo\nmissions and for the Skylab and ASTP\nmissions.\nThere have been no known\nillnesses\nin the crewmembers at critical mission times since the Program\nwas initiated.\nA comparison between\nthe results observed with and without\nthe program showed a significant\n(p<.O01) decrease in the number of\nillness\nevents when the program was\nused.\nMATERIALS\nANDMETHODS\nFor the STS-1 mission all personnel\nwho were required\nto work in crew\nareas were identified\nand given medical examinations.\nAll of those who\npassed the examination were designated as primary contacts.\nSecurity was\nplaced at the door of the training\n\n88\n\nwere badged.\nMedical consultation\nwas made available\nto all personnel\nwho worked in crew areas.\nSecurity\nwas not used in the work areas or for\ncrew movement from place to place,\nHealth protection\nfor the crew was\nbased on personal compliance to the\nprogram recommendations.\nCrew housing and food service was made available for crew use on a voluntary\nbasis at the training\nand launch\nsites.\n\nA total of 38 known ill\npersons were\nkept out of crew work areas and\nthereby possibly prevented crew illness.\nIt is suspected that many ill\nindividuals\ndid not enter crew areas\nand did not report their\nillnesses.\nPersonnel\nawareness\nof\npossible\nflight\ncrew illness\nwas probably one\nof the most effective\nelements of the\nSTS-I Health Stabilization\nProgram.\n\nThe STS-I Health Stabilization\nProgram was continued for 11 days until\nthe Orbiter landed on April 14, 1981.\nThe illness\nprevention\nmeasures for\ncrew protection\nwere carried out as\noutlined\nin the document JSC-I1852,\n"Health Stabilization\nProgram (OFT)."\n\nThe Program limited\nthe access of\nlarge numbers of newspersons to the\ncrew.\nAll non-NASA .persons who visited the crew were glven medical examinations.\nAlso, large numbers of\npersonnel were restricted\nfrom entering building\n5, including\nNASA personnel,\ncontractor\npersonnel,\nand\npublic\nvisitors\nto the exhibits,\nthereby eliminating\novercrowding and\nreducing possible exposures.\n\nThe number, type,\nand location\nof\nSTS-I personnel

SHUTTLE\nLAUNCH\nAND LANDING\nAndrew E. Potter,\n\nCHAPTER\n16\n\nPh.D.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nBecause the Space Shuttle was a new\nlaunch\nvehicle,\nemploying\nlarger\nsolid rocket boosters than any previous\nvehicle,\nits\nenvironmental\neffects\nwere not known prior to the\nfirst\nlaunch.\nThus, the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for the\nSpace Shuttle\nProgram, published in\n1978, relied on estimates and extrapolations\nderived\nfrom Titan\nIII\nlaunch cloud measurements and on\nsupersonic wind tunnel tests for prediction\nof sonic booms. The objective\nof the Shuttle\nEnvironmental\nEffects\nProgram is to verify\nthe\nestimates\nand extrapolations\npublished in the 1978 EIS by means of\nmeasurements of launch cloud effects\nand sonic booms.\n\nOf lesser\nconcern\nare potential\nweather modification\neffects\nby the\naluminum oxide dust suspended in the\nlaunch\ncloud\nand acoustic\nnoise\neffects on wildlife.\n\nThe principal\nexhaust products from\nthe Shuttle\nengines\nare aluminum\noxide dust, hydrogen chloride\ngas,\ncarbon dioxide gas and steam along\nwith\ntraces\nof nitrogen\noxides,\nSince the vehicle rises slowly during\nthe first\nfew seconds after ignition,\nthe exhaust products accumulate in a\nlarge cloud near ground level.\nSteam\nand spray from deluge water at the\nlaunch pad are entrained\ninto the\nrocket exhaust, and also contribute\nto the exhaust cloud.\nInitially\nthe\nexhaust cloud is hot and buoyant,\nrising\nto an altitude\nof about 3000\nfeet where it stabilizes\nand drifts\nwith the prevailing\nwinds.\nThe estimated amount of exhaust constituents\nin the cloud are large:\naluminum\noxide dust, 56 metric tons; hydrogen\nchloride,\n35 metric tons; and approximately I00 metric tons of steam and\nspray.\nThe possibility\nof significant environmental effects from toxic\nhydrogen chloride\nis the major concern relative\nto the launch cloud.\n\nThe NASA/Marshall Space Flight Center\n(MSFC) Multilayer\nDiffusion\nModel was\nused to predict exhaust cloud deposition footprints\nfor hydrogen chloride\nand aluminum oxide dust prior to each\nlaunch,\nusing meteorological\ndata\nfrom preflight\nsoundings.\nA prediction\nwas provided\nto the Kennedy\nSpace Center (KSC) Medical Operations\nat about F-2 hours to provide advance\nwarning in the event that there might\nbe a potential\nhazard to the viewing\npublic from cloud fallout.\nAfter the\nSTS-I launch, for which an unexpectedly\nlarge\nfallout\nof\nhydrogen\nchloride-wet\nparticles\nof aluminum\noxide was noted, the dust deposition\nparameters in the model were empirically altered to provide a better fit\nbetween the observed and calculated\nfallout\npatterns of wet dust fallout.\n\nSonic booms are produced by the\nShuttle both during launch and during\nreentry,\nlaunch booms impact the sea\noff the launch site,\nand are of less\nconcern than reentry\nbooms, which\nimpact populated land areas.\nAs a\nconsequence, sonic booms were measured in the reentry corridor\nwest of\nEdwards Air Foce Base, California.\nMATERIALS\nANDMETHODS\nExhaust Cloud Predictions\n\nSurface Measurements of the Exhaust\nCloud\nSurface measurements were made by\ndeploying a network of monitor sta91\n\ntions, each of which included several\nmeasurementdevices. A complete monitor station initially included a nucleoporefilter (for dust), pH paper,\ndry buckets, hydrogen chloride dosimeter, indicator plants and mineral\noil dishes. After STS-1, polished\ncopper plates were added.\nAfter\nSTS-3, the mineral oil dishes and\nindicator plants were deleted. At\nsome stations, a Geomet hydrogen\nchloride gas analyzer was included,\nPartial instrumented stations were\nalso deployed. These generally included pH paper and a polishedcopper\nplate,\nThe deployment statistics for these\nstationsfor STS-1 through STS-4 were\nas follows:\nComplete\nStations\nSTS-1\nSTS-2\nSTS-3\nSTS-4\n\nPartial\nStations\n\n44\n52\n17\n17\n\n9\n8\n34\n34\n\nAfter STS-2, the number of complete\nstations was reduced, reflectingthe\nfact that hydrogen chloride concentrationsmeasured in STS-1 and STS-2\nwere extremely small. Most of the\nstationswere deployed along the predicted exhaust cloud footprint,with\nthe remainder at random locations\naround the KSC area.\n\n(LaRC) was used to sample the exhaust\ncloud, measuring the total and gaseous hydrogen chloride concentrations\nas well as the size distributionof\naluminum oxide dust, using a lO-stage\nQCM analyzer. The substantialfallout of hydrogen chloride-wet particles noted for the STS-1 cloud led to\na change in measurement strategy for\nSTS-2. For this case, the lO-stage\nquartz crystal microbalance (QCM)\nanalyzer on the LaRC aircraft was\nreplaced by a Knollenberg probe designed to measure large particles,\nboth inside the cloud, and falling\nbelow it.\nIn addition, a National\nOceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) aircraft fitted with\ncloud physics instrumentation collected data from the STS-2 exhaust\ncloud.\nEcologicalMeasurements\nNative vegetation at various sites\nwas examined and tagged prior to the\nlaunch. Postflight examinations of\nthe plants were made to assess any\neffects.\nAerial photography using\nfalse-colorinfrared film was made of\nthe areas believed to be affected by\nfallout from the cloud in order to\ndetect any changes in vegetation\nappearance. Observationsof wildlife\nwere limited to birds. Five sites\nwere monitored during STS-I. Little\nor no disturbance was noted for\nSTS-1, so that no further observations were made.\n\nIn addition to the mobile monitor\nsystems, four permanent air monitor\nstations (PAMS) were operated during\neach launch. These stations measure\nozone, sulfur dioxide, hydrogenchloride and nitrogen oxides. They were\nlocatednear the launch pad, near the\nsouth gate, at Dunn Airport in Titusville and the National Wildlife\nRefuge northwestof the launch pad.\n\nBenthic organisms (bottom-dwelling\nmicroscopic invertebrates)were sampled from the lagoon muds before and\nafter each launch. The number and\ndiversity of the benthic population\nis a sensitive measure of environmental stress.\nAcousticMeasurements\n\nAirborneMeasurementsof the Exhaust\nCloud\n\nAcoustic noise at various points\naround the launch pad was measured\nusing recording sound level meters.\nFifteen meters were deployed for\n\nFor STS-1, an instrumentedaircraft\noperated by Langley Research Center\n\n92\n\nSTS-1, six for STS-2,\nSTS-3 and STS-4.\n\nand two for\n\nchloride\nwas most likely\ndue to\nscavenging of hydrogen chloride from\nthe exhaust gases by deluge water.\n\nSonic Booms\nSurface Measurements of the Exhaust\nCloud\n\nSonic booms were recorded by ground\nstations\nlocated\nunder the flight\npath of the Orbiter just prior to its\nlanding\nat Edwards Air Force Base\n(EAFB). These stations each consisted of a wide-response microphone (0.I\nto I0,000 hertz),\na time-code generator and a 14-track AM/FMtape recorder.\nEleven stations\nwere deployed\nfor STS-I, four for STS-2 and STS-4.\nFour stations were also deployed for\nSTS-3, but no data were obtained because the Orbiter\nlanded at the\nNorthrup\nStrip,\nWhite Sands, New\nMexico.\n\nSurface measurements revealed an unexpected environmental effect of the\nexhaust cloud.\nA widespread deposition of acidic\ndroplets\noccurred.\nThe fallout\nwas heavy in the region\njust north of the launch pad, where\nsubstantial\ndamage to one to two\nhectares of vegetation and minor fish\nkills\ntook place.\nThe fallout\nregion\nnear the pad was clearly outlined by\ndead vegetation.\nHot acidic\nspray\nresulting\nfrom interaction\nof the\ndeluge water with the solid\nrocket\nbooster exhaust flame was believed to\nbe the cause. Leaf and soil surfaces\nin this region showed traces of tan\naluminum oxide deposits.\nA choking\nodor was evident for several\nhours\nfollowing\nthe launch.\nAt least part\nof the odor was found to be due to\ngaseous hydrogen chloride\nwhich appeared to originate\nfrom evaporation\nof a gaseous hydrogen chloride\npresent on the soil and vegetation following the launch.\nThere was another\ncomponent, as yet not identified,\nto\nthe odor.\n\nRESULTS\nThe NASA/MSFC Multilayer\nDiffusion\nModel was successful\nin predicting\nthe general direction\nof the exhaust\ncloud movement to within\nabout 30\xc2\xb0\nazimuth.\nFar-field\nsurface concentrations\nof hydrogen chloride\npredicted by the model were much larger\nthan observed.\nIn fact, virtually\nno\ngaseous hydrogen chloride was measured at the surface, other than at the\npad surface itself,\nComparison of airborne measurements\nof hydrogen chloride with model predictions\nfor STS-I led to a similar\nresult,\nin that the predicted values\ninside\nthe airborne\ncloud were a\nfactor of two or more larger than the\nmeasured values.\nAs the cloud aged,\nthis discrepancy decreased, indicating that the diffusion\nrates used in\nthe model were too large.\nIn summary, it appears that the model was\nconservative by at least a factor of\ntwo, and perhaps much more. The fact\nthat gaseous hydrogen chloride\nwas\nnot observed at the surface was probably due to scavenging of gaseous\nhydrogen chloride by a water aerosol.\nThe discrepancy\nbetween calculated\nand observed airborne total hydrogen\n\nOutside\nthe pad region,\nfallout\neffects\nwere much less marked, but\nnonetheless\ncould be detected\nfor\nconsiderable\ndistances.\nFor STS-1,\nacidic\ndroplets\nwere detected 8 km\nfrom the pad, and for STS-2, acidic\ndroplets were detected 15 km from the\npad. STS-3 and STS-4 produced clouds\nwhich went directly\nout to sea, so no\ndata are available\nfrom them. The pH\nof these droplets\nwas <I, so that\nthey produced damage spots on the\nleaves of sensitive\nvegetation,\nlike\nnative\npennywort.\nPlants with resistant\nleaves,\nsuch as mangrove,\nwere unaffected.\nEach of the acidic droplets\nto contain\na nucleus\nof\n93\n\nappeared\naluminum\n\noxide dust, so that the fallout particles could be called wet aluminL_\noxide dust, as well as acidic droplets or mist.\nCuriously enough, the Geomet analyzers and hydrogen chloride dosimeters\ndetected very little gaseous hydrogen\nchloride from the exhaust cloud. The\nfew positive indications found were\neither from very near the pad, or\nappeared to be anomalous. This differs from Titan exhaust clouds, for\nwhich surface hydrogen chloride was\ndetected, even though the amount of\nhydrogen chloride in the Titan exhaust cloud was about a third of that\nexpected in the Shuttle exhaust\ncloud,\nIt appears that the exhaust cloud for\nthe Shuttlewas alteredby the deluge\nwater, which was applied in unprecedented amounts. Steam and spray from\nthe deluge water evidentlymixed with\nthe exhaust cloud and scavenge hydrogen chloride. Most of the effect was\nnoted close to the pad, where the hot\nacid spray damaged vegetation for\nhalf a mile north of these areas,\nSubstantial amounts of hydrogen\nchloride must be removed from the\ncloud at this point. Some of the\nsteam and spray were carried aloft by\nthe updrafts associatedwith the hot\nbuoyant cloud.\nEventually, this\nmaterial fell out as droplets or wet\naluminum oxide dust as the cloud\nmoved with the prevailingwind.\nSeveral instances were reported\n(STS-1 and STS-2) of acidic droplets\n(or wet acidic dust)falling on exposed skin of observers. In some\ncases, a slight burning sensationwas\nreported, which disappeared after\nwashing the skin with water.\nNo\nlong-lasting or recurrent effects\nhave been reported.\n\nly, leaving behind only a trace of\naluminum oxide dust. No damage to\nthe automobilefinish was observed on\nthe eight\nto ten automobiles\ninspected.\nAirborneMeasurementsof the Exhaust\nCloud\nAs noted previously, aircraft measurements of hydrogen chloride (total\nand gaseous) during STS-1 and STS-2\nshowed the hydrogen chloride concentration to be less than predicted by\nthe model,\npresumably due to\nscavenging.\nMeasurementsof the dry particle size\ndistribution in the range 5-35\nmicrons performed for STS-1 gave results similar to those found for\nTitan exhaust clouds.\nFor STS-2, wet (or aerosol) particle\nsize measurements were made over a\nwide range, using Knollenbergprobes,\nboth on the LaRC and NOAA aircraft.\nA few minutes after launch, the exhaust cloud aerosol size distribution\npeaked near 200 microns. Particles\nthis size were suspended by updrafts\nin the cloud during the period of\ncloud rise. At later times, when the\ncloud stabilized and the updrafts\nceased, these particles fell out of\nthe cloud.\nMeasurements of ice\nnuclei in the cloud showed very\nlittle activity above ambient levels.\nThe NOAA aircraft collected a very\ncomplete set of cloud physics data,\nwhich is still being analyzed. Preliminary indications from the data\nare that the large cloud droplets\noriginate primarily from the deluge\nwater.\nEcologicalMeasurements\nNo significant ecological effects\nwere noted. Wildlife was slightly\nand temporarily disturbed by the\nlaunch. Vegetation spotted or damaged by fallout from the cloud recovered quickly,except in the damage\n\nDuring STS-2, many automobiles received acidic droplet fallout, in\nsome c@ses at densities in excess of\nlO0/cm\nL. The drops evaporatedquick-\n\n94\n\narea adjacent\nto the launch pad.\nBenthic organisms in the la_o_ were\nunaffected by launch operatlons,\nal\nthough the population\ndid display\nsymptoms of a mild chronic stress.\nAcoustic\n\nstations were deployed.\nNo data were\ncollected\nfor STS-3, due to the landing at Northrup Strip.\nOnly the data for STS-1 have been\ncompletely analyzed.\nFor this analysis,\nsonic boom overpressure\nlevels\nwere calculated\nfrom supersonic wind\ntunnel,\nmeteorological\ndata and the\nactual flight\npath, and were compared\nwith the measured overpressures.\nIn\nall but one case, agreement between\ncalculated\nand observed values was\nwithin\n+10%.\nThe single\nanomaly\nnoted may have been due to a local\nvariation\nin meteorology.\n\nMeasurements\n\nSound levels\nat all\nmonitor\nsites\nwere less\nthan\nthe 90 decibels\nA-weighted\n(dB-A) permissible\nfor\n8hours of occupation.\nThe closest\nsite was 4.8 km from the launch pad.\nThe highest sound level recorded was\nIII\ndB-A at 4.8 kilometers\nfrom the\nlaunch pad. By extrapolation,\nit was\npredicted\nthat the peak sound level\nat the pad was about 127dB-A. Based\non these data,\nit\nwas recommended\nthat personnel\nat sites\ncloser\nor\nequal to 3 km from the launch pad\nshould be provided\nhearing protection, but those at larger distances\ndid not require protection,\n\nThe follow-on measurements for STS-2,\nand for STS-4 were aimed at determining the peak overpressure\nand the\nlateral\nextent of the sonic boom, respectively.\nPeak overpressures were\nsought in STS-2, but a change in wind\nconditions\nevidently\nmoved the peak\noverpressure\nregion away from the\nmeasurement sites,\nsince overpressures less than expected were measured.\nLateral cutoff was sought in\nSTS-4, and this was observed, as two\nof the outermost stations recorded no\nsonic boom. Analysis of these data\nis still\nunderway.\n\nSonic Boom\nReentry sonic booms were measured for\nSTS-I, 2, and 4. The most extensive\nmeasurements were made for STS-1,\nwhen eleven stations\nwere deployed,\nnine directly\nbeneath the ground\ntrack.\nFor later flights,\nonly four\n\n95\n\nEMERGENCY\nMEDICALSERVICES\nSYSTEM\n(EMSS)\n\nCHAPTER17\n\nSam L. Pool,M.D. and NormanBelasco\n\nThe responsibilityfor planning and\nimplementation the EmergencyMediof\ncal Services System (EMSS)during the\nfirst four Space TransportationSystern (STS) Shuttle flights resided\nwith the Space and Life Sciences\nDirectorate at the Johnson Space\nCenter (JSC). Emergencymedical support for launch and landing operations of the Shuttle was mobilized by\nJSC with aid from the Departmentof\nDefense Managementof Shuttle (DDMS).\nThe objectiveof the EMSS was to provide the ill or injured crewmen with\nrapid access to the appropriatelevel\nof medical care. To meet this objective, the following factors were\ncarefully considered in developing\nthe EMSS for STS: accessibility to\nhealth care centers, personnel,\ntraining,experience,transportation,\nresponse times, equipment,communications, medical records, costs, special environmentalhazards and rescue\nprocedures,\nDISCUSSION\nTo properly structure the EMSS, the\nlaunch and landing environs were\nexamined to determine the capability\nof the local health care centers, and\naccessibilityto more distantmedical\nfacilitiesthat could providedefinitive care. Also, means of transportation, possible routes and Medevac\ntechniqueswere studied. After careful planning,the EMSS was structured\nto effectivelyutilize existing capabilities and proven techniques by\nlargely standardizing elements and\nfunctions among the participating\nsites,\n\nHospital for Dryden Flight Research\nFacility (DFRF),Jess Parish Hospital\nfor Kennedy Space Center (KSC), and\nHolloman AFB Hospital for the\nNorthrup Strip (NS). For definitive\nmedical care, NASA negotiatedagreements with Shands Teaching Hospital,\nGainesville,Florida (for KSC); Loma\nLinda UniversityMedical Center, Loma\nLinda, California (for EAFB); and a\nDOD facility, William Beaumont Army\nMedical Center, El Paso, Texas (for\nNS). Staffs at all facilities had\nbeen trained in the Shuttle unique\nmedical requirements. They participated in Medevac training exercises\nand in mission alerts.\nHelicopterswould be used for transportation of ill or injured crewmembers.\nPrior to transportation,\npatients are stabilizedat the scene.\nThe equipment for most of the stabilizatlon process is flown on the\nhelicopters. Special training is\ngiven to the physicians (NASA/DOD)\nand parajumperswho fly on the helicopters. All physicians are given\nadditional instruction in care of\ntrauma victims. Once the ill or injured crewman\'s health problems have\nbeen assessed and initial stabilization given, the helicopter physician\nmay elect to transportthe crewmen to\neither the intermediate definitive\nor\ncare facility.\nAn emergencymedical record would be\nrequired for any patient emergency\ncare. It would contain the following\ninformation: a history of physical\nfindings relevant to the injury or\nillness treated, a medical diagnosis\nor impressions,complete list of any\ntreatmentsgiven, patient\'scondition\nupon delivery to the hospital, and\nsignature\nof\nthe\nresponsible\npnysician.\n\nLocal hospitalswere available at or\nnear each site.

NS was used\nas STS-3 End of Mission (EOM) landing\nsite because of weather problems at\nEAFB. For STS-I through STS-4, the\nNS was initially\nconsidered the backup landing site.\nThe NS was also designated as a landing site if an underburn occurred or an Abort-OnceAround was required.\nOther DOD (nonCONUS) contingency\nlanding\nsites\n(CLS\'S) were identified\nat Hickam\nAFB, Hawaii; Kadena AFB, Japan; and\nRota, Spain. Dakar, Senegal, was selected\nas the landing\nsite\nfor\na\ntransatlantic\nlanding\n(TAL),\nfor\nSTS-4.\nAt Dakar, where there was no\nUSAmilitary,\nJSC provided for EMSby\nstationing\na JSC flight\nsurgeon at\nthe airstrip,\nsupported by a DODC-9\n"Nightingale"\n(an airborne\nmedical\nfacility)\nstaffed\nwith\na trauma\ntrained physician, two nurses and two\nmedics.\nIf necessary,\nthis\nteam\ncould transport\nthe ill\nor injured\ncrewmember\nto\nWiesbaden,\nWest\nGermany, for definitive\nmedical care.\n\nAt all sites,\na physician EMSS Coordinator\ncommunicates through\nthe\nlocal site control\ncenter to assure\nthat the field\ncenters are appropriately staffed and ready for any emergency operation.\nHe also communicates with EMSScoordinators\nat other\nfield\nsites and the MOCRsurgeon at\nJSC.\nThe EMS as standardized\namong the\nsites,\nEdwards AFB (EAFB) in California at KSC and NS, permits the JSC\nMOCRsurgeon (EMSS physician in Mission Control)\nto relay any inflight\nproblems that might affect the recovery operations to the EMSSCoordinator at his respective site.\n\nCONCLUDINGEMARKS\nR\n\nA communication system was established at KSC, the launch site, and CONUS\nlanding sites EAFB and NS to permit\nthe Emergency Medical System Coordinators to coordinate\nthe activities\nof the emergency medical helicopters\nin the event of a problem.\nOnce the\nhelicopters\nare airborne\nand within\n\n97\n\nIn conclusion,\nthe Emergency Medical\nServices System established for STS-1\nthrough STS-4, was on station\nfor\neach mission with trained\npersonnel\nappropriately\nequipped, and ready to\ndeal with any launch or landing contingency that resulted\nin a medical\nemergency.\n\nMISSION SUPPORT\nREPRESENTATIVE\nMEDICAL OPERATIONSSYSTEM - EMS\n\nDEFINITIVE\nMEDICAL\nFACILITY\nFLIGHT SURGEON\n\n__\nFLIGHT SURGEON\nAND P.J.\n\n_o\n\nco\n\nSITE CONTROL\nCENTER\nEMSS COORDINATOR\n\nLAUNCH AND\n\nINTERMEDIATE\nCARE FACILITY\n\nLANDING\nSITES\n\nMOCR SURGEON\n\n"_---_ _\n\nJSC\nBME\n\nFIGURE17-I\n\n\'_--,-_1\n\nAMBULANCE (EaT\'s)\n\n1, Report\n\nI\n\nNo,\n\n2.
