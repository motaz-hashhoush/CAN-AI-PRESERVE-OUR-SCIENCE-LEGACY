While it is steady-state performance that largely determines the efficiency of civil air transports, engine operability and transient performance define constraints for the steady state design that impact efficiency and system viability. Neglecting dynamics and control technologies can result in an over-designed, sub optimal propulsion system or a concept that is not feasible. Thus, dynamic system studies were conducted on the propulsion system of the conceptual aircraft design known as the Single-aisle Turboelectric AiRCraft with Aft Boundary Layer propulsor (STARC-ABL). This paper describes the development of a controller to verify the baseline concept's feasibility from an operability perspective. Further, studies were conducted to identify excessive stability margin in the baseline design that could be traded for potential benefits in efficiency through an engine re design. This study revealed the potential to reduce the high pressure compressor (HPC) stall margin by 3%. Finally, a study was conducted to investigate the potential benefit of adding energy storage to the STARC-ABL concept that further improves operability and enables more gains in engine efficiency and performance. The energy storage provided an additional 0.5% stall margin can be removed from the HPC.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20190030358, "endDate": "2019-08-22T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA)", "location": "Reston, VA, United States"}}, "meetingId": "ddc4cba7ecc6413f9a88d6d4abb51f4d", "id": "19989bb4ea7e465a9c7b1b8e1329c32f"}], "name": "AIAA Propulsion and Energy Forum", "location": "Indianapolis, IN", "id": "ddc4cba7ecc6413f9a88d6d4abb51f4d", "startDate": "2019-08-19T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20190030358, "id": "847809435bd349d2bcc6c10b3f19fffd", "publicationDate": "2019-08-21T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 20190032489, "type": "SEE_ALSO", "title": "Dynamic Analysis of the STARC-ABL Propulsion System", "stiType": "TECHNICAL_MEMORANDUM", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}, {"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 20190030508, "type": "SEE_ALSO", "title": "Dynamic Analysis of the STARC-ABL Propulsion System", "stiType": "PRESENTATION", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20190030358.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20190030358/downloads/20190030358.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20190030358/downloads/20190030358.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20190030358/downloads/20190030358.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
