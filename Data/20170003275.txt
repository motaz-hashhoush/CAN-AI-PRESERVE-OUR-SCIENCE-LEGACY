Urban growth projections for the continent suggest that the relevance of this\nprocess will increase in the coming decades. Forest degradation associated to charcoal production\nis difficult to monitor and commonly overlooked and underrepresented in forest cover change and\ncarbon emission estimates. We use a multitemporal dataset of very high-resolution remote\nsensing images to map kiln locations in a representative study area of tropical woodlands in\ncentral Mozambique. The resulting maps provided a characterization of the spatial extent and\ntemporal dynamics of charcoal production. Using an indirect approach we combine kiln maps and\nfield information on charcoal making to describe the magnitude and intensity of forest\ndegradation linked to charcoal production, including aboveground biomass and carbon emissions.\nOur findings reveal that forest degradation associated to charcoal production in the study area is\nlargely independent from deforestation driven by agricultural expansion and that its impact on\nforest cover change is in the same order of magnitude as deforestation. Our work illustrates the\nfeasibility of using estimates of urban charcoal consumption to establish a link between urban\nenergy demands and forest degradation. This kind of approach has potential to reduce\nuncertainties in forest cover change and carbon emission assessments in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\n\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\n1\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\n1. Introduction\nDeforestation and forest degradation are the principal causes of forest cover change and account\nfor a large proportion of global carbon emissions (Achard et al., 2007; van der Werf et al., 2009).\nDeforestation, defined as the long-term or permanent conversion of land from forest use to other\nnon-forest uses (GOFC-GOLD, 2009), represents an abrupt and rapid change in land cover. Many\nremote sensing studies have exploited the spectral signals of land surfaces to monitor\ndeforestation at medium (250 \xe2\x80\x93 1000 m) and high resolutions (20 \xe2\x80\x93 30 m)(Hansen & DeFries,\n2004; Mayaux et al., 2005; Achard et al., 2007). As the volume of satellite data expands and\ncomputer-processing power increases, operational deforestation monitoring at high spatial\nresolution remote is becoming a reality (Hansen et al., 2013). Forest degradation is a direct,\nhuman-induced, long-term loss or reduction in forest carbon stocks and forest values not\nqualifying as deforestation (GOFC-GOLD, 2009). The partial removal of forest carbon stock\noften occurs at subpixel scale and is not detected by high-resolution satellites. Higher resolution\nsensors (0.5 cm\xe2\x80\x933 m) offer enhanced spatial detail but their use is often limited by non-systematic\nacquisition dates. As a consequence, remote sensing monitoring of forest degradation is more\nchallenging and not as well established as monitoring deforestation (De Fries et al 2007; Herold\net al., 2007).\nBased on radar imagery and field inventory, Ryan et al. (2012) estimated that forest degradation\ncould be responsible for roughly 67% of the aboveground biomass (AGB) total net losses in\nAfrican woodlands. Fuelwood collection and charcoal production are the main components of\nthis forest degradation (Hosonuma, 2012; Chidumayo & Gumbo, 2013). Charcoal is a key source\nof energy in African urban centers where nearly 80% percent of the population uses it as the main\nsource of energy for cooking (FAO, 2010; Zulu and Richardson, 2013). Population projections\nindicate an unprecedented increase in the urban population in African cities, increasing from 30%\nin 2000 to reach 60% by year 2050 (UN-Habitat, 2010; Boko et al., 2007; Montgomery, 2008).\nThe energy needs of the growing urban population will pose an increasing pressure on forest\nresources of rural areas (Barnes et al., 2004; Arnold et al., 2006; Grimm et al., 2008). There is\nincomplete understanding of the drivers behind this degradation process and its connection to\nurban energy demands. There is also limited quantitative information about some of its key\nelements, such as extent of degraded areas, intensity of the degradation, spatial and temporal\ndynamics of the process, AGB removals and carbon emissions (Bolognesi et al., 2015).\nThis manuscript characterizes forest degradation associated to charcoal production in central\nMozambique. We implement a multisource approach that combines information extracted from\nmultitemporal very high-resolution (VHR) satellite images and information from field surveys to\ncharacterize forest degradation associated to charcoal production. Isolated from other major urban\ncenters, this study area represents a closed system with few leakages in which most of the\ncharcoal consumed in the city of Tete (hereafter Tete) is produced in the Province and only a\nsmall part of the charcoal produced in the Province is exported to outside markets (Kambewa et\nal., 2007). This characteristic offers a unique opportunity to understand the links between forest\ndegradation associated to charcoal production and urban growth in the tropical woodlands of\nsouthern Africa. This work aims to improve the current understanding of forest degradation in\ntropical dry forests of southern Africa as a first step to develop forest degradation monitoring\nsystem, contributing to a growing body of research that investigates the link between urban\nenergy consumption and forest degradation.\t\r \xc2\xa0\n2. Study area\nThe study was conducted in the Tete Province, in central Mozambique (Figure 1). The Tete\nProvince is crossed by the Zambezi River from northeast to southwest and is landlocked between\nZambia, Zimbabwe, Malawi and the Mozambican provinces of Manica, Sofala and Zambezia. Its\naltitude ranges from 100 m above mean sea level in the lowlands along the Zambezi valley to\n\n\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\n2\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\n1,500 m in the plateau and mountains to the East. The mean annual temperature 26.5 \xc2\xb0 Celsius\nand the average annual precipitation is 627 mm with a well-defined dry winter from June to\nOctober. The Province lays in the ecotone of the miombo and mopane ecosystems and\nrepresentations of both alternate depending of topographic and soil conditions. Miombo\nwoodlands, characterized by tree species of the Brachystegia and Julbernardia genii, occupy\nareas of higher precipitation and altitude while mopane woodlands, dominated by trees of\nColophospermum mopane (mopane), occupy lower elevations. These main charcoal production\nareas of the Province are dominated by mopane woodlands often intertwined with islands of\nmiombo woodlands and acacia shrublands. Since 2008 the city of Tete has experienced a rapid\ngrowth associated to the discovery of large coking coal deposits. This growth has been followed\nby an increase in urban charcoal consumption.\n\n\t\r \xc2\xa0\nFigure 1: Location map of the Tete province and Changara and Moatize production areas.\n\n3. Data\nWe used a dataset of unclassified commercial satellite images with less than 20 percent cloud\ncover acquired for the study sites for the period 2008 \xe2\x80\x93 2014, obtained from the NASA National\nGeospatial Intelligence Agency (NGA) archive (Neigh et al. 2013). This dataset included images\nfrom QuickBird-2, GeoEye-1, WorldView1, WorldView2 and WorldView-3 (Table 1).\nWorldView1 has a panchromatic band while the rest of the platforms have both panchromatic and\nmultispectral bands. For all sensors, the panchromatic images have sub meter spatial resolution\nand the multispectral images range from 1.6 to 2.4 meters. Because of data availability, the\nimagery was restricted to the main production areas of Tete, in the districts of Changara and\nMoatize. The dataset contained 49 images, from which 28 correspond to the Changara site and 21\nto the Moatize site. The images provided full annual coverage of the study sites from 2011 to\n2014 and partial coverage of the sites from 2008 to 2010 (Table 2).\n\n\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\n3\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\nSatellite\nQuickBird-2\nGeoEye-1\nWorldView-1\nWorldView-2\nWorldView-3\n\nNumber\nof Images\n9\n9\n21\n9\n1\n\nTable 1: Number of very high-resolution images and\nsensor included in the dataset.\n\nChangara\nMoatize\n\nDry months\nRainy months\nDry months\nRainy months\n\n2008\n63.7\n0\n0\n0\n\n2009\n68.5\n0\n0\n0\n\n2010\n0\n8.7\n45.5\n0\n\n2011\n100\n100\n20.8\n100\n\n2012\n100\n58.2\n78.9\n100\n\n2013\n100\n0\n100\n0\n\n2014\n100\n100\n100\n0\n\nTable 2: Annual percentage of area in charcoal production areas covered by very high-resolution images.\n\n4. Methods\n4.1. Biophysical field survey\nThe field surveys collected data about basic components of the charcoal production process and\nthe forest stands in the production areas. During July 2015, field crews visited 165 kilns in 18\ncharcoal production sites distributed in the districts of Changara (6), Moatize (6), Chiuta (4),\nMarara (2) and Cahora Bassa (2). These locations were selected, based on discussion with\nnational experts, provincial Forest Services and local producers, to obtain a complete\nrepresentation of charcoal production conditions in the Province. The visited kilns were dated and\ngeocoded. For each kiln, the perimeter of the cutting area associated was measured with a hand\nheld GPS unit and the number of stumps within the cutting perimeter, minimum cutting\ndiameters, and main tree species were registered. The dimensions of each kiln were measured\nwith a measuring tape and the number of sacks produced by each kiln was estimated with the\nassistance of local charcoal producers. When intact forest stands in the vicinity were still present,\nwe measured average stand heights and basal areas with a wedge prism to serve as a baseline of\nthe forest conditions in the site before charcoal production.\n4.2. Remote sensing analysis\nCharcoal production involves a selective removal of trees within a certain area that leaves a at\nleast 10% of the canopy cover (Ribot, 1993; Pereira et al., 2001). The partial removal of trees\ndoes not necessarily result in significant variations of the spectral signal because the remaining\nvegetation and tree regeneration often maintain a vegetated surface. As a consequence VHR\nsensors cannot always detect the changes in crown cover (Figure 2). We identified the presence of\nkilns as an indicator of forest degradation and the temporal and spatial evolution of kiln locations\na proxy of forest degradation extent and intensity. To maintain a landscape level perspective of\nthe forest degradation process, we estimated forest degradation at 500 x 500 m grid-cells,\ndefining two levels: moderate forest degradation for areas with less than one kiln per hectare (grid\ncells with less than 25 kilns); and intense forest degradation for areas with at least one kiln per\nhectare (grid cells with at least 25 kilns).\nWe used visual interpretation to map the kilns in the VHR images and kilns mapped were labeled\nwith the acquisition date of the image in which they were detected. A detailed description of the\n\n\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\n4\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\nvisual interpretation process is provided in the Supplementary materials (S1). The full satellite\ndata coverage for the period 2011\xe2\x80\x932014 in both study sites ensured the precise date was assigned\nto each kiln from 2012 to 2014. The kilns detected on 2011 imagery and labeled as such\npotentially included kilns that were constructed in 2010. The partial coverage of the study areas\nbetween 2008-2010 resulted in an incomplete detection of charcoal production activities and\npotentially incorrect kiln dating. Thus the kilns mapped in the satellite images of those years were\nnot used to estimate the extent of the production area, aboveground biomass removals or carbon\nemissions resulting from charcoal production.\nTo evaluate the impact of deforestation and forest degradation we compared forest degradation\nestimates based on kiln density and deforestation from Global Forest Change 2000 \xe2\x80\x93 2014\nproduct (Hansen et al., 2013). To identify the main driver behind charcoal production we overlaid\nthe kilns detected in the VHR images and the Global Forest Change 2000 \xe2\x80\x93 2014 product under\nthe assumption that kilns located in deforested land were a byproduct of agricultural expansion\nand kilns in forested land had been built with the main purpose of making charcoal.\n\nA\n\nB\n\n0\n\n1 km\n\nC\n\n0\n\n100 m\n\n0\n\n100 m\n\nFigure 2: Example of kiln identification in very high-resolution images: A) Landsat 8 false color composite (457) (June\n2014); B); Close view of Plate A box area; C) Multispectral very high-resolution of same area (December 2014). Blue\npolygons mark charcoal kiln locations.\n\n4.3 Aboveground biomass removals and carbon emissions\nWe estimated AGB and carbon emissions from the charcoal making process in the production\nareas and, AGB, carbon emissions and extent of the forest degraded as a consequence of charcoal\ndemand in the city of Tete. These variables were estimated using an indirect approach that\ncombined information from the field survey, kilns mapped in the VHR dataset and parameters\nobtained from previous regional studies. Indirect approaches that combine information from\nvarious sources have been identified as a viable option to monitor forest degradation when\ncanopy removals are low or little spectral evidence remains from the canopy gaps (Herold et al.,\n2011). All the expressions are described in detail in the supplementary material (S1).\nThe AGB removal in the study sites was estimated as a product of the number of kilns mapped in\nthe area, the average charcoal produced per kiln calculated from field measurements, and\ncharcoal conversion efficiencies obtained from previous studies in Mozambique (Pereira 2001;\nPereira 2002). The corresponding carbon emissions were estimated based on the amount of\ncharcoal produced in the area and CO2 and CH4 emissions factors obtained from regional studies\n(Penisse et al 2001; Kammen and Lew, 2005).\nThe annual AGB removal due to charcoal consumption in Tete was estimated as the product of\nthe total urban population (National Institute of Statistics of Mozambique), the estimated rate of\nurban population using charcoal (SEI, 2002; Mwampanda, 2007; Zulu, 2010; Gumbo et al.,\n2013), per capita charcoal annual consumption (Silva unpublished) and charcoal conversion\n\n\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\n5\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\nefficiencies. Similar approaches have been previously applied in southern Africa to estimate the\nimpact of urban energy needs in forest resources (Mwampanda, 2007). The annual carbon\nemissions from charcoal making for Tete was estimated as the product of the charcoal consumed\nannually in the city and the CO2 and CH4 emission factors. The potential area affected by forest\ndegradation annually from charcoal consumption in Tete was estimated as the ratio of the urban\ncharcoal consumption and the product of the average charcoal produced per kiln in the study\nareas and the average kiln density detected in the VHR images.\n\n5. Results\n5.1. Charcoal production\nFieldwork provided information to characterize key components of the charcoal production\nactivities. While charcoal production can vary in response to local and specific situations, their\nmain characteristics are shared throughout the study area. Charcoal producers in the visited sites\nnormally apply a selective logging system based on tree species and tree size using trees above a\nminimum cutting diameter of 15 cm (STD 4 cm). Producers show a strong preference for\nmopane. Fifty-five of the visited kilns contained exclusively mopane timber, and 15% more\ncomplemented mopane with other tree species including Brachystegia spiciformis, Brachystegia\nboehmii, Cordyla africana, Combretum imberbe and several species of the Acacia genus. Mopane\nforms large monospecific stands. The average stand height measured in the field ranged from 7 to\n17 m (Mean=13.6, STD=3.0) and the average stand basal area from 8 to 34 m2/ha (Mean=18.1,\nSTD=8.9). Its straight trunk charcoal making operations and its dense timber (1.02 -1.14 g/cm3)\nproduces charcoal with high caloric power (Bolza and Keating, 1972). Trees used in the kiln are\nfelled around the kiln location from an average cutting area of 0.31 ha (STD 0.28 ha), although\nthe variation can be large depending on the density of suitable trees (Figure 3). Based on this\nnumber, a hectare of woodlands could supply timber to build a maximum of three kilns. The kiln\nlocations are usually selected based on the availability of suitable trees in the area and the access\nto trails and roads. There is strong linear relationship between the volume of the kiln and charcoal\nproduction. The average kiln produces 104 sacks of 15 kg (Figure 4). The length of the visited\nkilns varies from 2 to 26 m, with an average length of 8.1 m (STD 4.6 m), and 39% and 8% of the\nkilns are larger than 10 and 15 m respectively. The average width of the kilns in the area is 2.2 m\n(STD 0.3 m) and the average height is 1.2 (STD 0.2).\n\nFigure 3: Relationship between cutting area extent (ha) and\nnumber charcoal sacks produced in the kiln (average sack\nweights 15 kg).\n\n\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\nFigure 4: Relationship between kiln volume and number of\ncharcoal sacks produced (average sack weights 15 kg).\n\n6\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\n5.2. Forest degradation\nWe identified 8,561 kilns in the 49 VHR images for the period 2011\xe2\x80\x932014, from which 4,650 and\n3,911 corresponded to Changara and Moatize study areas respectively (Figure 5 and Figure 6). In\naddition, 353 kilns were detected in Changara during the period 2008-2010. The number and\nlocation of the kilns detected in the VHR images from 2008 to 2014 explain the recent history of\ncharcoal production in the Tete Province (Table 3). The district of Changara was responsible for\nthe largest share of charcoal production in the initial years while a significant part of the activities\nmoved to the production areas of Moatize in the later years. A large proportion of the production\nareas remained active over the 4-year study period but the extent of this area gradually increased\nover time as additional forests were incorporated (Table 4). In both study areas the centroid of the\nkilns built in a year, moved over time away from paved roads and Tete. This displacement pattern\nindicates that distance and access to urban markets is a main factor behind charcoal production\nand highlights the urban link of the forest degradation process.\n\nChangara\nMoatize\n\n2008\n223\n0\n\n2009\n129\n0\n\n2010\n1\n0\n\nYear\n2011\n1148\n328\n\nTotal\n2012\n1840\n260\n\n2013\n1222\n1834\n\n2014\n440\n1435\n\n5003\n3911\n\nTable 3: Number of kilns detected per year in each charcoal production area.\n\nYear\nChangara\nMoatize\n\n2011\n328.86\n161.11\n\n2012\n423.31\n216.26\n\n2013\n445.24\n314.87\n\n2014\n451.96\n323.86\n\nTable 4: Extent of charcoal production areas (km2)\n\nThe density of kilns gradually increases over the years and reveals a heterogeneous distribution of\nthe carbon stocks removals (Figure 7 and Figure 8). The maximum kiln density in the study areas\nis 2 - 2.4 kiln/ha. This number is smaller than the theoretical maximum estimated from the\naverage cutting area size measured in the field (3 kilns/ha), and indicates that, over the years, up\nto 80% of the AGB can be extracted in areas of intense forest degradation.\nCharcoal production is not closely related to agricultural expansion in the Tete Province.\nComparison between kiln locations and the Global Forest Change 2000 \xe2\x80\x93 2014 product (Hansen\net al., 2013) shows that only 0.22% and 0.90% of the kilns built in Changara and Moatize\nrespectively overlaid land deforested in the last 15 years. The rest of the kilns identified in the\nVHR images were built in forested locations not converted into agriculture.\nThe comparison of forest degradation area estimated from kiln locations with deforestation\nfigures from Hansen et al. (2013) showed that, in Changara, the area of degraded forest surpassed\ndeforested area during 2012 and 2013, and only in 2014, when charcoal production moved to\nMoatize, the annual area of degraded forest was less than the deforested land (Figure 9).\nThe reversed situation occurred in Moatize, where deforestation was higher in 2012, and as\ncharcoal production grew in the district, degraded forest area nearly doubled the area of\ndeforestation, with a significant proportion corresponding to intense forest degradation.\n\n\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\n7\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\nFigure 5.

Lower\nenvelope assumes an annual per capita consumption of 5 sacks of charcoal and moderate\nforest degradation (kiln density=1 kiln/ha).\n\nThe estimated AGB removals accumulated in the study areas over the period 2011\xe2\x80\x932014 were\n95,394 tonnes of biomass and 36,946 tonnes of CO2 of emissions. At provincial level, the\nestimated area of degraded forest due to charcoal demand in Tete was below the deforested area\nfor the period 2011\xe2\x80\x932014. The charcoal demand of Tete in 2014 accounted for 65.3 km2 (\xc2\xb126.1\nkm2) of degraded forest. The estimated ABG removals associated with the charcoal demand of\nTete in 2014 were estimated in 96,940 (\xc2\xb112,463) tonnes of biomass and the corresponding carbon\nemissions in 37,545 (\xc2\xb14,826) tonnes of CO2. Assuming the current population projections and\nsimilar charcoal consumption patterns, the charcoal urban demand is expected to increase in the\n\n\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\n10\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\nnear future, as is the area of degraded forest due to charcoal production. In 2040, Tete would\naccount for AGB removals of 216,951 (\xc2\xb127,892) tonnes and carbon emissions of 84,025\n(\xc2\xb110,082) tonnes of CO2. Provided that the spatial patterns of charcoal production remain similar\nto those identified in this study, the urban demand for charcoal in 2040, would require between 89\nand 212 km2 of forestland (Figure 10).\n6. Discussion\n6.1. Monitoring forest degradation with VHR satellite data\nOur study illustrates the potential of VHR satellite images to monitor a main component of forest\ndegradation in sub Saharan Africa. In this study we assembled annual full coverage of the study\nareas for every year from 2011 to 2014 and partial coverage for the period 2008\xe2\x80\x932010. Kiln\nidentification benefited from large multitemporal stack of images. Analyses based on limited\nacquisition periods provide a snapshot of the charcoal production at a moment in time but offer\nlimited insights about the spatial and temporal evolution of the process. Fewer observations are\nlikely to result in more omission errors and inaccurate kiln dating.\nPrevious studies have identified the difficulties of mapping kilns in VHR with consistent\naccuracies using automatic and semi-automatic feature extraction methods (Rembold et al., 2013;\nBolognesi et al., 2015; Dons et al., 2015). Factors such as image acquisition date, viewing and\nillumination angles and changes in the kiln size, shape and color over time have an impact in the\nautomatic identification of kilns in VHR images (Figure 11). Using visual identification of kilns\nthat maximizes the number of kiln detections in a large dataset of VHR images, this study\nimproves our understanding of the spatial and temporal dynamics of charcoal production.\n\nFigure 11. Kilns in several multispectral very high-resolution images over the study areas (red polygons). The\nappearance of the kiln varies depending on factors such as kiln production phase, soil contrast, image acquisition date,\nviewing and illumination angles and atmospheric conditions.\n\n\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\n11\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\n\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\t\r \xc2\xa0\n6.2. Drivers of charcoal production\nUnderstanding and quantifying the drivers behind different forest degradation process is a crucial\nfirst step to implement effective management practices and design successful interventions\n(Herold et al., 2011). Fuelwood collection and charcoal production are commonly grouped\ntogether in forest degradation assessments. However they are associated with different drivers\nand impacts. While fuelwood collection is mainly consumed in rural areas, charcoal production is\ndriven by urban demand. This mischaracterization has led to consistent underestimations of the\nimpact of charcoal production in forested lands (Mwampamba, 2013).\nOur results suggest that charcoal production is the main driver of forest degradation in the study\narea. While agricultural expansion is the main contributor to forest cover change at provincial\nlevel, forest degradation from charcoal production accounted for nearly 30% of forest cover\nchange in the Tete Province for 2014. In charcoal production regions, the extent of forest\ndegradation from charcoal production exceeded deforestation due to agricultural expansion\n(Figure 9). While in wet woodlands of the region, charcoal is considered as a secondary product\nof agricultural expansion, our results showed that in semiarid areas, where agriculture is not the\nmain activity, charcoal production is a process largely independent from agricultural expansion.\nFindings from rural producer surveys corroborate this idea and indicate that charcoal sales are the\nprimary income source for 83% of respondents and that the activity is intensifying as households\ndiversify agricultural income sources. (Silva unpublished).\nAs urban population projections for Africa indicate unprecedented growth in the coming 40 years\n(Boko et al., 2007; Montgomery, 2008), the magnitude and relevance of this forest degradation\nprocess is likely to increase unless important shifts are made in energy consumption patterns\n(Figure 10).While lower levels of charcoal production may be sustainable (SEI, 2002), the tree\ngrowth rates in a region of limited precipitation cannot compensate the current pace of\nexploitation. This highlights the relevance of studying charcoal production as a separate process\nand developing specific monitoring systems and environmental strategies that take into account\nthis key cause of forest cover change in the region. \t\r \xc2\xa0\n6.3. Charcoal production and carbon emissions\nCharcoal-based energy demand has been identified as a mechanism of forest cover change in\nAfrica (Hosonuma et al., 2012, Sitoe et al., 2016). The emissions associated to this mechanism\nrepresent a key component of the large CO2 emissions and emission uncertainties at continental\nlevel (Ciais et al., 2011). Despite its importance, emissions associated to forest degradation are\nstill poorly quantified and few studies explicitly include them in carbon emissions assessments.\nYevich and Logan (2003) and Chidumayo & Gumbo (2013) used survey data and national\nstatistics to produce a first estimate of carbon emissions from charcoal in Africa. Yet, a large\nshare of charcoal production is not registered in national statistics, which constrain the accuracy\nof these approaches (Mwampamba et al., 2013). The combination of existing sources of\ninformation with field and satellite data has the potential to improve the quantification of forest\ndegraded area and carbon emissions linked to urban charcoal demand.\n\n\t\r \xc2\xa0\n7. Conclusions\nWe used a multitemporal dataset of very high-resolution satellite images to map charcoal kilns in\na study area of tropical woodlands of southern Africa. We implemented an indirect approach to\nestimate forest degradation area and intensity, aboveground biomass removals and carbon\nemissions based on the location of kilns and field information about the charcoal making process.\n\n\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\n12\t\r \xc2\xa0\n\nThe results improve our understanding of spatial and temporal dynamics of forest degradation\nassociated to charcoal production. The findings of this work indicate that charcoal production is a\nmain contributor of forest degradation. In the charcoal producing districts, charcoal production\nwas largely independent from agricultural expansion. The area of forest degradation associated to\ncharcoal production was larger than the area of deforestation and over larger geographical areas it\nwas as high as 50% of the deforested area. Our study underlines the relevance of charcoal\nproduction to estimate total emissions from forest cover change in the African context. While this\ncontribution is underestimated in current REDD+ assessments, our work shows the feasibility of\ncombining VHR imagery and field data to characterize and quantify this forest degradation\nprocess. It also highlights the importance of incorporating charcoal specific monitoring strategies\nin the context of REDD+ monitoring, reporting and verification efforts as a first step to reduce\ncarbon emissions uncertainties in sub Saharan Africa. Further work expanding the analysis to\nother locations will contribute to account for regional variability related to local environmental\nand socio-economic characteristics. This work also provides a proof of concept of the feasibility\nof using estimates of urban charcoal consumption to establish a link between urban energy\ndemands and forest degradation. These approaches will benefit from more reliable demographic\nrecords and reliable population projections in the region. While charcoal is expected to remain the\nmain component of the energy mix in African urban households (Arnold et al., 2006; Zulu, 2010),\nfurther efforts to understand urban energy consumption behavior in response to social, economic\nand environmental factors will contribute to reduce the uncertainties of future carbon emissions\nestimates associated to charcoal consumption.\nAcknowledgements\nThis research is part of the \xe2\x80\x98CNH-Ex: Investigating the Dynamic Intersections Among Economic\nDevelopment, Urbanization, and Forest Degradation\xe2\x80\x99 project, funded under the National Science\nFoundation - Dynamics of Coupled Natural and Human Systems program (Award number\n1413999).\t\r \xc2\xa0The authors express their gratitude to students and representatives of the Universidade\nEduardo Mondlane, Universidade Pegagogica \xe2\x80\x93 Tete branch and the personnel of the provincial\nForest Services of Tete whose contribution and support made possible field data collection.\t\r \xc2\xa0\nReference list\nAchard, F., DeFries, R., Eva, H., Hansen, M., Mayaux, P. and Stibig, H-J., 2007.
