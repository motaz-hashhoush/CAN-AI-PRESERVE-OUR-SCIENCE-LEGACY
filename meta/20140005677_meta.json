This information, found in the various site and system log files available on the ILRS website, is essential to the ILRS analysis centers, combination centers, and general user community. Therefore, it is imperative that the station personnel inform the ILRS community in a timely fashion when changes to the system occur. This poster provides some information about the various documentation that must be maintained. The ILRS network consists of over fifty global sites actively ranging to over sixty satellites as well as five lunar reflectors. Information about these stations are available on the ILRS website (http://ilrs.gsfc.nasa.gov/network/stations/index.html). The ILRS Analysis Centers must have current information about the stations and their system configuration in order to use their data in generation of derived products. However, not all information available on the ILRS website is as up-to-date as necessary for correct analysis of their data.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "Japan", "submissionId": 20140005677, "endDate": "2013-11-15T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "National Inst. of Information and Communications Technology", "location": "Tokyo, Japan"}}, "meetingId": "4de6d2472a1d489bac3bc499cce171de", "id": "ce073afb973e48519a096076d18d4acf"}], "name": "International Workshop on Laser Ranging", "location": "Fujiyoshida", "id": "4de6d2472a1d489bac3bc499cce171de", "startDate": "2013-11-11T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20140005677, "id": "bb65d570b5fb432685f8c162c29863aa", "publicationDate": "2013-11-11T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20140005677.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20140005677/downloads/20140005677.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20140005677/downloads/20140005677.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20140005677/downloads/20140005677.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
