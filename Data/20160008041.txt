The only eligible participants are small business concern (SBC) with 500 or\nfewer employees or a nonprofit research institute such as\na university or a research laboratory with ties to an SBC.\nThese programs are potential sources of seed funding\nfor the development of small business innovations.\n\nNotable Accomplishments\t\nThe FY 2014 SBIR/STTR Solicitations (see figures for\ncover pages) opened for companies to submit proposals for phase I feasibility studies. For Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate subtopics,\nNASA Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) was lead\nCenter on four subtopics: Nuclear Thermal Propulsion,\nExtreme Temperature Structures, Spacecraft Cabin\nAtmosphere Quality and Thermal Management, and\nRecycling Reclamation of 3-D Printer Plastic, and participating Center in eight subtopics.\n\n108\n\nFor the Space Technology Mission Directorate, MSFC\nwas lead Center for one subtopic: Large-Scale Polymer\nMatrix Composites Structures, Materials and Manufacturing Processes, and participating Center on one\nsubtopic.\nFor the SBIR SELECT Solicitation, MSFC was lead\nCenter for one SMD subtopic: Advanced Technology\nTelescope for Balloon and Sub-Orbital Missions, and\nparticipating Center in one subtopic.\nFor STTR solicitation, MSFC was lead Center for two\nsubtopics: Affordable Nano/Micro Launch Propulsion\nStages and Experimental and Analytical Technologies\nfor Additive Manufacturing, and participating Center\non one subtopic.\n\nZP30 developed briefing charts for SBIR/STTR technical monitor\xe2\x80\x99s (TM\xe2\x80\x99s) and contracting officer\xe2\x80\x99s (COR\xe2\x80\x99s)\ntechnical reps and conducted these briefings on May 2\nand 14. The MSFC SBIR Office along with the Center New Technology Representative and NASA Shared\nServices Center provided valuable information to assist\nthe TMs and CORs in the successful execution of\nphases I and II contracts.\nMSFC awarded 32 SBIR/STTR FY 2014 phase I contracts and 10 FY 2012 phase II contracts.\nMSFC awarded six phase III contracts. These contracts\nwill continue the development of the SBIR/STTR innovation with funding from NASA programs/projects\nand/or external funding sources. Of these five contracts,\nthree were funded by Space Launch Systems, two were\nfunded by Advanced Exploration Systems, and one was\nfunded by Technology Excellence.\n\nMSFC received 32 FY 2014 phase I awards and eight\nphase II awards.\n\n109\n\nSBIR\n\nFor Science Mission Directorate (SMD), MSFC was\nlead Center for two subtopics: Advanced Optical Systems and Slow and Fast Light, and participating Center\nfor 12 subtopics.\n\n'
