The cor\xc2\xad\nrosion resulted in approximately 40 small leaks in the fuel tank. As a\nresult it was decided to use a substitute tank and submit the 5013 tank to\nfailure analysis.\nThis report covers the results of tests outlined in Test Plan GDC-BNZ69\xc2\xad\n007, which was approved by General Dynamics Convair Division (GDC)\nand NASA-Lewis Research Center (LeEC). The major objectives of the\nprogram were:\na.\n\nCharacterize the type of corrosion by x-ray and metallurgical\nanalysis.\n\nb.\n\nDetermine the cause of the corrosion by chemical analysis.\n\nc.\n\nDetermine the degree of degradation of mechanical properties of\n-the joints by static and fatigue tests.\n\nd.\n\nDetermine the corrosion inhibiting effectiveness of WD-40 compound\nand required renewal period by exposing typical joint specimens at\nETR and San Diego.\n\nIt has been shown by metallurgical analysis that the corrosion is pitting\nand stress corrosion typically found at unprotected spotwelds in a sea\xc2\xad\ncoast environment. Considerable progress was made relating x-ray defect\nimages to metallurgical sections.\nThe primary corrodent was sodium chloride.\nThe static mechanical properties of samples taken from the 5013 tank\nwere reduced an average of 9% and were still well within engineering re\xc2\xad\nquirements. The fatigue values increased 10% and were well above\nengineering requirements.\nThe corrosion tests at Point Loma, San Diego show conclusively the effec\xc2\xad\ntiveness of W-40 in preventing corrosion in spotwelded joints in the sea\xc2\xad\ncoast environment. The test specimens, protected or unprotected, which\nwere exposed at ETR in the tower at Complex 36A did not corrode within\nthe same time as the 5013 tank. This suggests that weather or other un\xc2\xad\nknown factors were differentduring the year of the 5013 exposure. Since\nthe ETR specimens did not corrode appreciably, no ev\'iliiation of required\nWD-40 renewal times could be made. The Pt. Loma data indicates that\n30-day renewal is effective. After a year of 30-day renewals increasing\nthe renewal period to 90 days resulted in no corrosion.\nxvii\n\n\n\nSECTION I\nINTRODUCTION\nOn 23 October 1974, a post-fuel tanking inspection of the Atlas\'5013 (AC-33) tank dis\xc2\xad\nclosed approximately 40 areas of RP-1 leakage in the fuel tank. At the time the leaks\nwere thought to be caused by corrosion pits and stress corrosion cracks in the aft\nfaying surface of the cylindrical skin overlap joint. The aft faying surface was open\nto the external environment. A subsequent investigation into the vehicle 5013 fuel tank\nleakage problem resulted in a recommendation to conduct a test program to obtain\ncorrosion data from the 5013 vehicle fuel tank and to conduct a long-term test program\n(Reference 2). Authority to perform this activity and conduct the test is contained in\nTD 094-105. Table 1-1 shows a history of events.\nThis report documents the results, conclusions, and recommendations of the corrosion\ntest program outlined in Test Plan GDC-BNZ69-007, (Reference 2). For reader con\xc2\xad\nvenience, a verbatim copy of the test objectives as they were stated in Reference 2 is\ngiven below:\n"The test program is to be performed in two phases - Phase 1 will be the evalua\xc2\xad\nation of the 5013 vehicle fuel tank skin splice joints, and Phase 2 the evaluation of long\nterm environmental exposure at ETR.\nPHASE I - EVALUATION OF THE 5013 FUEL TANK SKIN SPLICE JOINTS\nA.\n\nSUMMARY\nFollowing the return of the 5013 vehicle to San Diego and removal of equipment,\nthe fuel tank will, first, be radiographed for test specimen correlation. The\ntank will then be sectioned to provide corroded samples for metaflographic\nexaminations and chemical analyses.

Leakage was noted at approximately 40 different areas.\nMost of the RP-i fuel was emanating from underneath the aft edges of the resistance\nwelded circumferential joints. However, some of the fuel was leaking from small,\nV-shaped, crack-like, surface indications adjacent to the aft edge of the resistance\nseam welds and aft spotwelds. Typical configurations of overlap, resistance welded\ncircumferential joints in the fuel tank are shown in Figure 2-1. Radiographs of\nportions of the circumferential joints on 25 October 1974 revealed many more hidden,\nsubsurface defect indications. Essentially all of the defects were located in the aft\nportion of the overlap joint. The aft portion is open to the external environment.\nBecause of the large number of defect indications, it was decided to remove the tank\nand use it for a long-term test program.\n2.2 TEST OBJECTIVES AND REQUIREMENTS (METALLOGRAPHIC ANALYSIS)\nThe overall objective of the metallographic analysis was to correlate the radiographic\ndefect images with actual physical evidence revealed by microscopic examination of\nmetallographic sections through typical defects. Documentation of these correlations\nshould improve the capability to interpret with greater accuracy and confidence the\nradiographs of resistance welded overlap joints in cold-worked 301 stainless steel\nsheet.\nSpecifically, the Unified Test Plan (Ref. 2) classified the various X-ray defect images\ninto 10 different categories, or items, depending upon shape, type (pit, crack, or leak),\nlocation, and orientation. Details are given in Table 2-1.\n2.3 PROCEDURES AND RESULTS\nOne of the requirements was to metallographically section into defects that were known\nto leak by visual observation of the outer surface. To pinpoint the location of the leaks,\nthe following procedure was used in October 1975. The tank was pressurized with\nnitrogen to 10 psig while in the horizontal holding fixture at Plant 19, San Diego.\n\n2-1\n\n\n\n-\n\n-- THE THICKNESS SCALE\nIS MAGNIFIED \t 5x .. _C_\n0.0293\n\n\n0.0295\n\n\n\nt\t\n\nSPGTWE LO\n\n\xc2\xad\n\n--.\t\t\n\n\\\n\nFOW D\n0.20\n\n1.42 IN.\n\nSEAMW ELD\n\nQ\n\n0.22\n\n1.41 IN.\n\nA -\n\n0.66\n\nQ\n\nOVERLAP\n\n0\nAFT\n\n-F-\t\n\n0\n\n0.68 \t\n\nSPOTWELD\n\nFORWARD\n\n\n\nQ\n0\n\nOVERLAP\n\n0\t\n\nSTA1057\n\nED0.5G\n\nESPOT\n\nEDGE \t\n\nSPACING\n\n0.65\n\nDISTANCE\n\nC\n\nSECTION C-C \t\n\n. .-- 0.0318\n0.0320\n\nt\n\nSPOTWELD\n\n0AD\n.20\n\nF\nORWA\n\nOVERLAP\n\n0.22 \t\nSEAMWELD\n\nROW B\n\nSPOTWELD\n\n0.77\n\n"1 \t\n\n0.34 \t\n\n__0.35\n\n;ED\n\nOVER LAP\n\nL\n\n__________________\n\n0.55\n0.62\n\nGE\n\nST00.\nSTA 1090.0\n\nSPOT SPACING\n\nDISTANCE\n0.0330\n.0332\nSECTION\n\nB\n\nB-B \t\n\nPLAIN VIEW (SCALE IX)\nLOOKING AT THE OUTSIDE\nSURFACE\nC3CORROSION AND STRESS CORROSION CRACKING INITIATED\n\n\nAT THE AFT INTERFACE\n\n65343-41\n\n\n\nFigure 2-1. \t Configurations of the Resistance Welded Circumferential Joints\n\nat Sta 1057.5 and 1090, and the Actual Measured Dimensional\nRanges of Metallographic Panels 1 and 2 (see Figures 2-3 and 2-4)\n2-2\n\n\n\nTable 2-1.\n\nSpecific X-Ray Image Categories (Items) to be Metallographically\nExamined per Reference 2, page 7\nX-ray\n\nItem\n\nIndication\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n\nType\n\nround\n\nLocation\n\nOrientation\n\npit\npit\n\nseam\nspotweld\n\ncrack\ncrack\n\nseam\nspotweld\n\nvertical\nvertical\n\nlength\n\ncrack\n\nseam\n\nhorizontal\n\nlength\n\ncrack\n\nround\nlength\nlength\n\nspotweld\n\nhorizontal\n\n7\n8\n9\n\n-\n\nknown visual leak\nknown visual leak\nknown visual leak\n\nseam\nspotweld\nseam\n\nvertical\nvertical\nhorizontal\n\n10\n11\n12\n\nnone\nnone\n\nknown visual leak\n\nspotweld\nspot-aft row\nspot-fwd row\n\nhorizontal\n-\n\nMeasure and record:\na.\nb.\nc.\nd.\n\nnugget diameter\nnugget penetration\nskin chemistry\n-%\n\ncarbide of specimen\n\nBubble leak-detection fluid was applied to the outside surface of each of the circum\xc2\xad\nferential joints as the tank was slowly rotated.

Two 12-inch wide\nmetallographic panels (No. 2 and 3) were cut from Row B; each contained at least one\nleak defect. Panels 2 and 3 were 41 and 42 inches long respectively. The location of\nthese panels in the overall fuel tank is shown in Figure 2-2.\nEach of the three panels was radiographed on 17 February 1976 using the single-wall\ntechnique detailed in Table 2-2. Each film was 4-1/2 inches wide by 17 inches long.\nAll of these radiographs, which altogether covered about a 108-inch length of the\ncircumferential joints, were examined with hand lenses and stereomicroscopes in the\n2-3\n\n\n\nROW\nF\n\nSTATION\n\n\n962.64\n\n\n\nE\t\n\n99250\n\nO\t\n\n1025.00\n\n31 IN.\n\n1057.50\n\nC\n\nT\n\nB\n\n-2\n\n-\n\n-a[\n\n1090.00\n\n3\n\n12INP0\nA\nY\n\nQUAD I\n\nX\n\nQUAD 11\n\nOUAD III\n\nY\n\nX\n\nQUAD IV\n\n112250\n1135.00\nY\n\nSCALE 0.75 IN.= 48 IN.\n65343-42\n\nFigure 2-2. \t Location of Ivetallographic Specimen Panels 1, 2, and 3\nin the 5013 Fuel Tank\n3X to 30X magnification range. Images of the greatest clarity and size that appeared\nto best represent the categories requested (Table 2-i) were selected for sectioning.\nAs it happened, all the selected locations were in Panels 1 and 2; consequently, Panel\n3 was not used for metallographic sectioning. The as-received outside surface\nappearance of these two panels, aft spotweld ID numbers, and the location of the various\nitems selected for metallographic sectioning are presented in Figures 2-3 and 2-4.\nFurther details are listed in Table 2-3. The chemical composition and the tensile\nproperties of the three coils that were welded together to form Row B and C are pre\xc2\xad\nseated in Table 2-4.\nThe radiographic defect images were magnified to 2X and 5X and recorded on Polaroid\n4 by 5 Land Film Type 52 using the setup shown in Figure 2-5. Then marker holes\n(0. 020-inch diameter, except for Item 3) were drilled near to each defect, and each\ndefect was radiographed again. These marker holes are needed as reference points\nso that the relationship between a section plane and the radiographic image can be\ndetermined accurately. The location of each metallographic section plane that was\nrecorded photomicrographically (in most cases at 25X) is shown in a sketch adjacent\nto each marker-hole radiograph. In addition, both the outer and inner surface appear\xc2\xad\nances of the leaking defects have been documented photographically using a conventional\nlight macrocamera or a scanning electron microscope.

It was\nrequested (Table 2-1, Items 11 and 12) that metallographic sections be made through\na spotweld in the aft row and a spotweld in the forward row that showed no evidence\nof X-ray image defects. Spotweld 6 (aft) and spotweld 6 (forward) in Panel 2 (Row B,\nSta. 1090) were selected, see Figure 2-4. The section plane was positioned in the\ncenter of each spotweld so that these specimens could be used for nugget diameter and\npenetration measurements also. In addition the overlapping spotweld row (seamweld)\nwas sectioned. The etched appearance of each of these three sections is shown in\nFigure 2-38 at 25X. No defect indications were observed in any of the sections.

As may be seen, the subject\nspotweld nuggets meet the penetration requirements but are slightly smaller than the\n0. 14-inch minimum diameter requirement\n2.3.2 301 XH BASE MATERIAL, CHEMICAL AND TENSILE PROPERTIES. The\nchemical composition and the tensile properties of the three 301 XH CRES coils that\nwere welded together to form Row B and C are presented in Table 2-4. The chemical\ncomposition and the mechanical property requirements of the GD/Convair specification,\nand also the chemical limits and aims set by the producer are listed in Table 2-5.\nAs may be seen from Table 2-4, the chemical and tensile properties of the three\n301 XFH GRES coils meet the requirements of GD/Convair procurement specification.\nThe carbon content (0. 092%) of the 0. 032 and 0. 033-inch-thick coils was slightly\nhigher than the limit of 0. 09% set by the producer.\n2.3.3 GRAIN BOUNDARY CARBIDES, PERCENT.

One sample for metallographic examination shall be\ncut from each end of each coil. Metallographic specimens shall be suitably pre\xc2\xad\npared and etched in accordance with the requirements of ASTM E3-62 using\nsodium cyanide solution number 34 at six volts for five minutes (minimum), with\nthe voltage maintained constant under load. The specimens shall be examined\nat a magnification of 250 or 500 diameters for the presence of grain boundary\ncarbides. The results shall be compared to the requirements of (a.) for con\xc2\xad\nformance.\nThe requirement controlling the amount of grain boundary carbide precipitation was\nintroduced many years ago (mid \'60s) into all of the GD/Convair procurement specifi\xc2\xad\ncations concerned with cold-worked 301 CRES coils (1/2H, 3/4H, XFH, etc.) to\ncontrol cryogenic notched tensile properties, not corrosion resistance.\nThe specimens used to check for the amount of grain boundary carbides were trans\xc2\xad\nverse sections cut from the cold-worked base metal near spotweld 5 in Panel 1 and\nnear spotweld 6 in Panel 2 (see Figure 2-3 and 2-4). The summed total length of\ngrain boundary carbide precipitation (black lines) in a 0. 0045-by 0. 009-inch area,\n2-48\n\n\n\nlocated in the center of each section, was determined. This is the normal receiving\xc2\xad\ninspection-type procedure that was used, and is being used, to check incoming\nmaterial. However, in this particular problem, of interest are microstructural\ncharacteristics that may affect the surface corrosion resistance, not cryogenic notched\ntensile properties.\nAs may be seen in Figure 2-39, there was a region (layer) of material extending from\neach surface Inward about 0. 002 to 0. 003 inch that contained no evidence of grain\nboundary carbides. This is logical, because these carbides form just after a coil\ncomes out of the 20500F annealing furnace in the 1600 to 8000F segment of the steam\xc2\xad\nquench cool-down cycle. The cooling rate will be slower in the center of the 0. 072\xc2\xad\ninch-thick coil as compared to the surface. This metallographic evidence indicates,\ntherefore, that the internal carbides formed during the cool-down after the final\nanneal cannot be a factor in the initial stages of surface corrosion attack.\nThe results of the grain boundary carbide measurements are listed in Table 2-6.\n2.3.4 FAYING SURFACE APPEARANCE. To compare the appearance of a portion of\nthe aft faying surface with the forward faying surface, spotwelds 1 through 5 of\nPanel 2 (Row B, Sta 1090) were drilled out. This allowed a 0.65-inch-wide by 2. 95\xc2\xad\ninch-long portion of each faying surface to be opened up by appropriate cutting of the\nseamweld. As shown in Figure 2-40, a considerable amount of rust-colored foreign\nmaterial (apparently a corrosion product) was present in the aft faying surface. Only\na slight amount of staining was observed in the forward faying surface.\n2.3.5 ELEMENT ANALYSES, COMPARISON. To obtain some information on the\nchemical nature of the laminated mixture of materials discovered in the low-density\ndefect indications of Items 1 and 2 (Figures 2-6 and 2-9), semi-quantitative analyses\nfor elements greater than atomic number 12 (Mg) were made in the defect area and,\nfor comparison, on a similar sized area on the base metal (301 CRES) using the X-ray\nenergy dispersive accessory on the scanning electron microscope. The results are\npresented in Figure 2-41. The white material (see Figure 2-8) in this laminated mix\xc2\xad\nture was determined to be 301 CRES base metal.\n2. 3.6 ETCHING. In most cases the appearance of each section plane is documented\nphotomicrographically in both the as-polished and etched condition. Electrolytic\n10% oxalic acid etchant was used in all cases except for the carbide checks.\n2.3.7 EXPOSED DOGBONE TENSILE SPECIMEN, DEFECT IMAGES. Radiographs\n\nof some of the corrosion-exposed tensile specimens had long, dark defect-type images\n\nextending in from the outer edge of the tensile specimen. These images ran parallel\nto the grain direction. The radiographic image appearance of three of these defects\n(labeled A, B, and C) is shown in Figure 2-42 for Pt. Loma specimen "Q\'. Defect A\nwas first sectioned in the plan-view direction to about 0. 003 inch beneath the surface\n(see Figure 2-43).

The appearance of eight\nof the section levels is shown in Figure 2-45.\nThe sectioning revealed that the defect images were caused by long, corrosion pits\nor tunnels running parallel to the grain direction.\n2.4 INTERPRETATION AND DISCUSSION\nTo accurately and fully interpret radiographic images of resistance-spotwelded,\noverlap joints in cold-worked 301 CRES, some understanding is needed of the material,\nthe joining process, and the interrelationship between the two. Accordingly, a short\ndiscussion is presented here on the metallurgy and microstructure of 301 XFH CRES,\nand the effects of resistance spot and seam welding.\nThe three subject 301 XFH CRES coils were work-hardened to high tensile strength by\ncold-rolling annealed material. A 50 to 55% reduction in thickness is usually required\nto produce the extra full hard (XEI-) temper. Relative to the microstructure, this work\xc2\xad\nhardening-by-rolling operation transforms the soft, single-phased, austenitic micro\xc2\xad\nstructure into a hard, multi-phased, microstructure consisting primarily of cold\xc2\xad\nworked martensite and cold-worked austenite. The typical etched, microstructural\nappearance of cold-worked 301 is shown in Figure 2-13 at 10OX. The heat of the spot\xc2\xad\nwelding operation transforms the hard (about 200 kst Fty) multi-phased microstructure\nback into soft (about 60 ksi Fty) single-phased austenite in the heat-affected zone (HAZ)\naround the weld nugget. The weld nugget itself has a cast microstructure because the\ntemperatures were high enough to melt the alloy in this localized, ellipsoidal-shaped\nvolume. In addition, during the spotwelding process the alloy actually yielded (upset),\nforming a ring-shaped region about 0. 001 to 0. 002 inch thicker than the sum of the\noriginal thicknesses. Although this does not appear to be very much, it is 1.5 to 3.5%\nof the original total thickness (0. 032 + 0. 033 = 0. 065). Since the currently used X-ray\nequipment consistently produces radiographs having a sensitivity better than 2%, these\nthicker, ring-shaped regions appear as white (actually lighter grey) ring-shaped images\n2-51\n\n\n\nI\n\n\n--\n\nSPOT-\n\n4\n\n\n\n2\n\n1\n\n5\n\n4\n\n3\n\nWELD\nNO.\n\n85343-1\n\nFigure 2-40.\n\nAppearance of Opened-up Aft and Forward Faying Surfacek,\nIL\n\n2-52\n\nO1UG -O ,\n\nOF T\n0?Dt\n\n\'\nISpOOR\n\n"\n\nBASE METAL (LARGE AREA-20OX-3r-W.D. -26 MM)\n\n(TIME\n\n7\n\n-\n\n10 NOV\n\n-2"\n\n100 SEC)\n\n=\n\n=\n\nM\n\n--\n\n7\n\n3\n\n\n\n7\n\nC\n\n301 XFH CRES BASE METAL\n\nDEFECT AREA (LARGE AREA-20OX-3-.\n\nFiur241\n\nSi\n\n26 MM)(TIMEE\n30100 L\n\nEeryv\n\n.\n\nX\n\n:\n\n2\n\n\n10 NOV 7\n\nSAND\n\ny A\n\ni\n\nR\n--\n\nC\n\nFe \n\n\nLAMINATED MIXTURE OF 301 AND LO*, ENSITY MATERIAL\n\nFigure 2-41.\n\nEnergy Dispersive X-ray Analysis Rtesults\n2-53\n\n6534"2\n\n5X\n\n\nX-RAY IMAGE OF THE EDGE DEFECTS A, 8, AND C\n\nALL DIMENSIONS ARE IN INCHES\n\nI\nGRAIN\nDIRECTION\n\n0.2 \t\n\n@EIGHT SECTION LEVELS \t\n\n0.033\n\nDE\n\nCFE\n\nDEFEC \t\n\nOUTER EDGE OF THE\nE\nDEO\nH\n\nTENSILE SPECIMEN\n\n65343.43\n\nFigure 2-42. \t X-ray Appearance of Defect Indications A, B, and C Extending Inward\nfrom the Edge of a Tensile Specimen, and the Location of the\nMetallographic Sections Shown in Figures 2-43 through 2-45\nin the radiographs of individual spotwelds.

Items 1 and 2 (Figures 2-6 and 2-9) are\ngood examples of the "pitting"-type attack. The word pitting is put in quotations\nbecause the surface corrosion attack did not simply dissolve the metal and leave a\nvoid or cavity. Instead, just one phase of the multi-phased, cold-worked micro\xc2\xad\nstructure was attacked, transformed, and replaced with a lower density, nonmetallic\nmaterial. Thus, the metallographic sections revealed the dark "pitting\'\'-type images\nto be caused by a complex, laminated mixture of base metal (301 CRES) and low\xc2\xad\ndensity, nonmetallic material. As shown in Figure 2-41, the only differences detect\xc2\xad\ned between the defect area and the base metal were lower Fe, higher Si, and possibly\nhigher K in the defect area.\n2.4.3 "PTTING"1-TYPE, LINEAR IMAGE. Item 5 (Figures 2-16 through 2-21) is a\ncombination of a rounded and a linear "pitting\'t-type defect. The three section levels\nrevealed that some of the pitting coincided with the weld-carbide precipitation zone\n(black band in the etched photomicrographs), not the internal, grain boundary carbides\ndescribed earlier. The radiographic image associated with Section B-B is just\nbarely visible. The total thickness of the defect at this location is 0. 003 inch\n(0. 0022 + 0.0008 = 0. 0030) or about 4.6% of the total sheet thickness (0. 065 inch).\nThis is considered to be, therefore, about the smallest (filled) "pitting"-type\ndefect that can be detected by radiography. The distinctive blurred image, and\nits position outside the white crescents, can be used to identify this image as a\n"pitting"-type defect and not a stress corrosion crack. Item 6 is a combination of\nlinear "pitting" and stress corrosion cracking.\n2.4.4 CRACKS. LINEAR IMAGES. All the other items (3, 4, 7, 8, and 9), whether\nthey leaked or not, were caused by stress corrosion cracking (in combination with\n"pitting"-type corrosion in some cases, see Figure 2-12). All these cracks originated\non the inside interface surfaces and propagated to the opposite surfaces as shown\nclearly in Figure 2-30. The stress corrosion cracks were primarily in the austenitic\nheat-affected zone of the spot or seamweld. Residual welding stresses are believed\nto be the primary source of the sustained tensile stress necessary to produce stress\ncorrosion cracking. The tight, stress corrosion cracks that were oriented perpen\xc2\xad\ndicular to the hoop direction of the fuel tank were opened up by the 68 psig pressure\ntest in October 1974. At the same time yielding (plastic flow) and possible crack\npropagation, occurred at the tip of some of the deeper cracks producing the typical\nV-shaped plastic zone, shown clearly in Figures 2-32 and 2-33.\n\n2-58\n\nSECTION 3\nCHEMICAL ANALYSIS\nAs soon as leaks were detected during tanking tests of the Atlas 5013 tank, steps were\ntaken to determine the nature, extent, and cause of the leaks.\n3.1 \t INITIAL CHEMICAL ANALYSIS BY NASA MALFUNCTION INVESTIGATION\nSTAFF, LABORATORIES DIVISION\nSamples were taken at the open edge of seams adjacent to leaks for chemical analysis.\nMIS analyzed these samples by electron microprobe and X-ray diffraction techniques.\nThe detailed results are reported in Reference 4.\nThese results can be summarized as showing the presence of stainless steel corrosion\nproducts (Fe, Ni, and Cr) and typical ETR environmental contaminants: sea salt,\ncalcium carbonate, calcium sulfate, and sand.\n3.2 \t CHEMICAL ANALYSIS OF TABS TAKEN FROM 5013 TANK\nAfter preliminary analysis of X-rays and chemical test results, it was decided to cut\ntabs from the seams of the tank to obtain better samples for analysis. Figure 7-1\nshows a typical tab cut from the tank, which clearly shows the stainless steel corro\xc2\xad\nsion products. Samples were given to the NASA Malfunction Laboratory and to the\nGeneral Dynamics Convair Chemical Laboratory.\n3.2.1 NASA MIS LABORATORY RESULTS. The detailed discussion of the MIS\nLaboratory results is found in Reference 3. These results confirmed the earlier\nresults that sea salt was the major contaminate.\n3.2.2 CONVAtR CHEMICAL LABORATORY RESULTS. The results of the Convair\nchemical analysis of the material on the tabs are found in Reference 2. These results\nalso confirm that the major foreign material present is sea salt. Since Reference 2\nwas published, a new instrument has become available called an ion chromatograph.\nWith this instrument a profile of the anions in a given sample can be obtained. Cations\ncan also be determined, but they have already been well characterized in References\n2, 3, and 4. Chromatograms were prepared for the materials found in the seams,\nETR seawater, ETR river water, ETR soil from near Complex 36A, and for standards.\nThis data is shown in Figure 3-1 and Table 3-1. It can be seen from this data that\nthe material in the seams in addition to the high chloride also contains minor constit\xc2\xad\nuents, (NO 3 and SO 4 ), which correspond roughly to the analysis of ETR seawater and\nsand when normalized to the chloride ion. This further confirms that the corrosive\nwhich caused the corrosion was the normal ETR environmental contaminant. No other\ncorrosive was found.\n3-1\n\nS0 4\n\n804\n_1-ppm\n\n"\n\nN0l03\n\nANION ANALYSIS\nATLANTIC OCEAN WATER\n\nxl\n\nxl\n\n.Lx1i..\n\nNo3\n0.9 ppm\n\n804\n1ppm\n\nCI\n6.2 ppm\n\nANION ANALYSIS\nBANANA RIVER\n\n8ppM\n\nX1\n\n=\n\n0.3 ppm\n\nX10\n\nANION ANALYSIS OF\nETR DUST ON PANELS\n\n\n\n0\nx.\n\nNO\n3\n4 ppm\n\nANION ANALYSIS OF\nETR SAND\nS0 4\n\nCII\n\n01\n\n7 ppm t\n\n2ppm1\n2 pp \n\nXI \n\n\n, L\n\nIX1\n\nN03\n\nW ANION\n\nANION ANALYSIS OF\nMATERIAL FROM 5013 TANK SEAMS\n\nANALYSIS \n\n\nCALIBRATION SAMPLE \n\nSP \n\nCLBAI\nxo\n\nS04P0\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n\n50 ppm\n\nCI\n7\n\npppm\n\n0 ppm\n\nNO\n3\n30 ppm\n\nxi\n\n02pp\n\n~CIE\n\nF\nP3\n\nL\n\n4 ppm\n65343-31\n\nFigure 3-1.\n\nIon Chromatograms of 5013 Tank Sample and Potential Sources\n\n3-2\n\nTable 3-1.\n\nAnion Analysis by Ion Chromatography\nComparison of Concentration\nof Major Anions\n\nSample\n\nChloride %o\n\nSulfate* %o\n\nNitrate* 95\n\nStandard Sea Water Analysis\n\n19\n\n2.6\n\n-\n\nAtlantic Ocean Water\n\n19\n\n1. 9\n\n-\n\nBanana River Water\n\n19\n\n3.1\n\n0.9\n\nSand\n\n19\n\n9.5\n\n8.5\n\nDust on ETR Dogbones\n\n19\n\n8.1\n\n10.9\n\nMaterial Extracted from\n\n5013 Seams\n\n19\n\n6.7\n\n2.4\n\n\n*Normalized to chloride at 19o\n\n3.3 \t SECTION CONCLUSIONS\n1. \t\n\nAirborne sea salt from the ocean (and or river) was determined by chemical\nanalysis to be the causitive agent of the observed corrosion.\n\n2. \t\n\nMinor amounts of NO 3 and SO4 are believed to play a minor role in the corrosion\nobserved since chloride alone can produce similar corrosion of unprotected stain\xc2\xad\nless steel.\n\n3-3\n\n\n\nSECTION 4\nMECHANICAL PROPERTY TESTS\nUniaxial static tension tests and fatigue tests were performed on specimens from\nclean and corroded areas of the 5013 tank to determine the residual strength after\nits encounter with a corrosive environment. Similar tests were performed on speci\xc2\xad\nmens that had an additional 18 months exposure at Pt. Loma to determine the value\nof WD-40 to prevent further corrosion of clean and corroded areas.\n4.1 \t LOCATION AND CONFIGURATION OF SPECIMENS\nAfter the Atlas 5013 tank was returned to San Diego and stripped of non-tank items,\nthe corroded areas were x-rayed. The analysis of these radiographs is contained\nin Reference 9. These results are summarized in Figure 4-1, which shows the\nlocation and degree of severity of the corrosion. From this data and a review of the\nx-rays, locations were chosen from which to cut out specimens for the mechanical\nproperty and corrosion tests. Corroded and clean specimens were taken from the\nareas shown In red in Figure 4-1. The details of the specimen configuration are\nshown in Figures 5-1 and 5-2. The assignment of specimens to various types of\ntests and test conditions as well as the type of corrosion represented by the specimen\nis shown in Figures 4-2 and 4-3. An x-ray positive print of typical defects is shown\nin Figure 4-4 and corresponds to the metallurgical section shown in Figure 2-36.\n4.2 \t RESULTS OF STATIC TENSILE TESTS OF SPECIMENS FROM AS-RECEIVED\nTANK\nThe room temperature static tensile tests and the tensile fatigue tests of specimens\ncut from the 5013 tank as it was received from ETR are shown in Figures 4-5 and\n4-6 and Tables 4-1 and 4-2. All of the samples designated corroded (D, F, Y, L,\nZ, 29) were from active leaking areas of the joints. From Figure 4-5 it can be seen\nthat the average reduction in static strength comparing the "clean" specimens with\nthe "corroded" specimens is about 10%. The strength of all of the specimens is\nabove the design requirement of 184 ksi. The maximum total in-flight stress for\njoints represented by these specimens was not expected to exceed 78 ksi. Since these\nspecimens represented the worst cases of corrosion, it appears that the tank joints\nhad a wide margin of safety for static structural strength.

The difficult problem is to explain why\nthe average of the corroded specimens is approximately 10% higher than the noncor\xc2\xad\nroded specimens. One idea is that the corrosion attacks at points of high stress con\xc2\xad\ncentration and thus the load is distributed better. The idea that It is caused by\nexperimental scatter is challenged by subsequent data of even more extensively\ncorroded specimens. It also appears that there is significantly more scatter in the\nfatigue data for the corroded samples than there is for the noncorroded samples. In\nany case It is pretty hard to sell corrosion as a way to increase fatigue resistance.\n4.4 GROWTH OF CIRCUMFERENTIAL CRACK\nX-rays were taken every 100 cycles of the fatigue test on specimen "Y" to follow the\ngrowth of a typical circumferential defect. This defect is a crack that occurs in heat\naffected zone at the edge of the seam weld. Metallurgical cross sections of this type\nof defect are shown in Section 2. Figure 4-7 shows the progression from 100, 500,\nand 646 cycles for specimen YA. The specimen failed at the YB joint at 646 cycles.\nThe progression of YB is shown in Figure 4-8 at 100 and 500 cycles.\nThis room temperature data shows that crack-like defects cannot be ignored as sites\nfor fatigue failure, but for the Atlas/Centaur missions where only a few cycles will\noccur it is somewhat academic. Crack growth and fracture toughness calculations\nindicate little loss in toughness when compared to noncorroded joint data.\n4.5 REVIEW OF POINT OF FAILURE OF STATIC AND FATIGUE SPECIMENS\nAs shown in Figure 5-1 the static and fatigue specimens were constructed from\nmaterial and joints from the 5013 tank. Two joints were connected by a third center\njoint to make one specimen. The center joint was a new clean joint. This joint was\ninadvertently designed with six instead of seven spots. This is only slightly less\nstrong than seven spots by actual test. This did result in only two specimens ulti\xc2\xad\nmately failing in the 5013 joints. This is a conservative factor because with seven\nspots the average data might have been slightly higher.\nAnother factor that caused some specimens to break outside of all of the joint areas\nwas the edge corrosion that occurred. This was in the form of deep but small diameter\nedge pits. This also resulted in conservative data for the test joints. This type of\npitting would not occur on the tanks because these end gain edges do not exist in the\ndesign. The characterization of this type of pitting is covered in Section 2.3.7.\n4.6 RESULTS OF STATIC TENSILE TESTS AFTER PT.

A record of the crack lengths was maintained at\nvarious number of applied loads for each of the cracks in specimens YA and YB.\ninasmuch as this data was available, it seemed prudent to compare the crack growth\nrates with those of the base material.\nThe standard method of presenting such data is to provide a plot of the variation of\ncrack growth per cycle (da/dn) with the crack intensity factor range (AK).\n4-12\n\n\n\n300\nPULLROD BROKE\nDAMAGING SPECIMEN\n\n200\n\n-/---\t\n\nDESIGN RED.\n184 KSI\n\nFTU\nKSI\nIO00\n\n\n\nMAX STRESS\n78 KSI\n\nT\n\nM\n\nA\t\nCORRODED\n\n\n\nNO WD-40 APPLIED \t\n\n65343-8\n\nFigure 4-9. \t Static Tensile Tests After Exposure at Pt.

The only unknown factor is the effect of biaxial loading on the corrosion\ndefects. Certain defects, as pointed out in the metallurgical analysis, Section 2,\nappearing as cracks oriented in the fore and aft direction, show evidence of yielding.\nThis yielding, due to hoop loads, was not duplicated by the uniaxial specimens\nselected by this program. So far as we know, no miniature tank tests have been per\xc2\xad\nformed on corroded joints to demonstrate the biaxial effect. The threat of these types\nof defects may be assessed by metallurgical and stress analysis.\nHorizontal defects oriented parallel to the hoop direction were exercised by the uniaxial\ntests performed on this program and show a wide margin of safety.\n4-15\n\n10-2\n\nN\n\nA\n\n/\n/\n10-3\n\n/\n\n/\n\n/\n\n/\n4\xc2\xad\n\n110-4\nz\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n"oCRACK \t\n\nGROWTH CURVE FOR 301 XFR\nPARENT METAL (REF. 21)\n\n~CRIES \t\n\n10-5 _\n\n--\n\n0 SAMPLE YA (100 TO 500 CYCLES)\n\n_~\n\n* SAMPLE YA (500 TO 646 CYCLES)\nAI- SAMPLE YB (100 TO 500 CYCLES)\n\n-\t\n\n(D\n\nASSUMED LOCAL STRESS IS 34 KSI\n\nSASSUMED LOCAL STRESS IS 67 KS1\n\na20\n\n40 "60 \t\n\n80\n\nA.K (Ws/in.) \t\n\n100\n\n120\n65343-40\n\nFigure 4-12. \t Variation of Crack Growth with Stress Intensity Range for\n301 SS Joints (Tank 5013)\n4-16\n\n4. 10 SECTION CONCLUSIONS\n1. \t\n\nThe room temperature static tensile properties of circumferential joints made\nfrom the corroded part of the 5013 tank were reduced 9% when compared to similar\nuncorroded specimens and were still well above engineering requirements.\n\n2. \t\n\nThe room temperature tensile fatigue data at 0 - 100 ksi for corroded specimens\nfrom the 5013 tank were, oddly enough, higher than the clean control specimens.\nAll values were much higher than engineering requirement s.\n\n3. \t\n\nOther corroded and noncorroded specimens made from the 5013 tank and exposed\nto an additional 18 months of seacoast environment were tested for static and\nfatigue strength.\na. \t The static tensile strength after 413 days at ETR and 18 months of exposure\nat Pt. Loma decreased 12% as compared to clean specimens.\nb. \t The fatigue strength of the corroded specimens increased an average of 127%\nover the uncorroded specimens. This increase was offset by a high degree\nof variability.\n\n4-17\n\n\n\nSECTION 5\n5013 TANK LONG TERM ENVfBONMENTAL EXPOSURE TESTS AT\nPT. LOMA\n\nIn October 1974 the Atlas 5013 (AC-33) tank was foumd to be leaking RP-1 fuel. This\nwas due to stress corrosion cracks in the Laying surface of the cylindrical skin over\xc2\xad\nlap joint. As a result of this problem, it was decided to conduct, among other things,\na long-term test program that exposed various parts of the tank to a natural marine\nenvironment. During this exposure some of the test specimens were to be protected\nusing standard protection procedures. This section documents the exposure of these\nspecimens at the Convair Pt. Lorna Test Site in San Diego, CA for 18 months.\n5.1 TEST PROCEDURE\nThe test specimens consisted of twelve 36 by 4 inch standard "dogbones" made from\n5013 tank weld joints. The details of the specimens are given in Convair drawing\nSD671-2-138, Test Specimen - Corroded Tank. The drawing defines the location on\nthe 5013 tank from which each test joint was taken. Each test specimen was made up\nof two 4-inch test joints and a new splice joint in the center. This was used to attach\nthe two test joints together to make the dogbone. Appropriate ends were applied to\nthe test joints so that they could be dead-weight loaded and tested. The joints are\ndepicted in Figure 5-1.\nA summary of the specimen variables is given in Table 5-1. The variables were initial\ncondition (clean or corroded), stress condition (unloaded or standby pressurization),\ncorrosion protection (none or WD-40), and final evaluation (static to failure or fatigue\nto failure).\nThe test\nThe 12 specimens were exposed on the tip of Pt. Loma at San Diego, CA.\nfrom the high-tide line.\nsite location was about 40 feet above and 40 feet inshore\nFigure 5-2 shows the tester and the test specimens during exposure. Every month\nthe specimens were removed from the tester and reexposed at a different location\non the tester so that all specimens received equivalent exposure with respect to\ndirection. While the specimens were unloaded, WD-40 was applied to P, U, E, and X\nfor the first nine months according to the techniques described in (GD/C Specification)\n0-79026. For the next nine months, P and U had WI-40 applied to the joints monthly\nwhile E and X were treated only every three months.\nAn X-ray examination was made of each specimen initially and monthly for the first\nnine months. During the next nine months the X-rays were taken every three months.\n\n5-1\n\n\n\nUP LOAD DIRECTION\n-\n\n-0.03 IN.

These figures document all of the x-ray analyses that were performed.\nVisually, the areas protected with WD-40 remained free of red rust corrosion while\nall of the other areas showed corrosive attack within one month.\nFigure 5-6 describes the X-ray data presented in Figures 5-3 and 5-4. Each test\nspecimen (dogbone) is represented by a plot of X-ray results as a function of exposure\ntime. In each box the specimen ID is given along with its initial condition, stress\ncondition, and protection variable. The X-axis represents exposure time in months.\n5-3\n\n/4-)\n\n\n\nS\n\nRODUCn3ILUY Om\n\nORIGINAL PAGE\n\nISF TIZ\n\n6530312\n\nFigure 5-2.\n\nPt. Loma Test Site\n\nThe Y-axis is a double scale of the number, N, of X-ray indications on the left side\nand length, L, of X-ray indications on the right. N is the cumulative increase in the\nnumber of X-ray indications. An X-ray indication is a defect in the specimen joint\nthat appears to indicate a corrosion crack. This is in contrast to a corrosion pit,\nwhich doesn\'t have any length. L is the cumulative increase in the total length of the\nX-ray corrosion indications. The specimen\'s initial X-ray examination before the\nPt. Loma exposure is represented by the two vertical lines in the center of each\nspecimen\'s results. The lengths of the vertical lines indicate the N and L initial\nvalues. They show the corrosion that took place during the joint\'s life prior to the\nPt. Loma exposure. The N and L values plotted are the cumulative increases over\nthese initial values.\nFigure 5-3 gives the results for the two tank joints of each dogbone while Figure 5-4\npresents the same data for the splice joint. Because there were two tank joints and\none splice joint on each specimen, the splice joint results were doubled and plotted\non Figure 5-4. Therefore, Figures 5-3 and 5-4 are comparable.\nFigure 5-5 is a plot of the total number of X-ray corrosion pits and indications for\neach specimen as a function of exposure time.

These results are presented in Section 4 of this report.\n5.3 DISCUSSION OF TEST RESULTS\nExamination of Figure 5-3 shows that, with a few exceptions not many additional cor\xc2\xad\n\nrosion indications were noted on the 5013 tank joints after a one month exposure. After \n\ntwo or three months, many corrosion indications were noted on all of the eight unpro\xc2\xad\n\ntected dogbones. The four specimens protected with WD-40 had essentially no attack. \n\nOne indication was noted on two of the specimens. None was noted on the other two. \n\nIt is interesting that one of the unaffected specimens had had significant previous cor\xc2\xad\n\nrosion. This trend continued throughout the entire 18-month exposure. No further \n\nchanges were noted on the WD-40 protected specimens, while corrosion on all eight of \n\nthe unprotected dogbones increased. The variables of initial condition or stress condi\xc2\xad\n\ntion appeared to have no effect on the magnitude of corrosive attack. \n\nThe results of the splice joint (Figure 5-4) followed a somewhat similar pattern. It \n\nshould be recalled that the splice joints were made just prior to exposure at Pt. Loma. \n\nThey were made under optimum factory conditions and were initially clean and un\xc2\xad\n\ncontaminated. The first indications of corrosion were not noted until after four or \n\nfive months. Two unprotected specimens were unaffected even longer. \n\n5-8\n\nThe four WD-40 protected specimens had no indications for their entire exposure\nperiod. It should be noted that the change of the WD-40 application period from 30\nto 90 days on specimens E and X for the final nine months had no effect on the number\nof corrosion indications.\n\nFigure 5-5 shows the total corrosion activity (corrosion pits and corrosion indications)\nduring the exposure period. It can be seen that corrosion pits were observed in most\ncases during the first month. As exposure time increases, the total number of\ncorrosion pits and indications becomes relatively constant. It was noted that the\ncorrosion pits turn into indications. This levels off the totals. It is also apparent\nthat the totals for the splice joint somewhat lag the tank joints. This is especially\ntrue during the initial and middle stages of exposure. The WD-40 specimens were\n\nessentially unaffected by the exposure. It is interesting to note that specimen E\nshows one or two pits after the WD-40 protection interval was changed. However,\nspecimen U also showed a pit during this interval. Its protection was not changed.\nIt seems that no real changes took place because of the modification of the WD-40\napplication.\n5.4 \t SECTION CONCLUSIONS\n1. \t\n\nA protective oil applied according to established procedures effectively inhibits\ncorrosion of Atlas tank joints exposed to a marine environment. Application must\nbe periodic and according to E. S. 0-79026.\n\n2. \t\n\nInitial condition and exposure to standby pressurization stress have no effect on\nthe corrosion.\n\n3. \t Some evidence exists for concluding that the application interval may be increased\nfrom 30 to 90 days without any increase in corrosion. It is felt that more work\nis necessary to draw a final conclusion on this point.\n4. \t The corrosion experienced on unprotected specimens exposed for 18 months to a\nnatural marine environment did not reduce static or fatigue joint properties below\nspecification requirements. (See Section 4.)\n\n5-9\n\n\n\nSECTION 6\n5013 TANK LONG TERM ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURE\nTESTS AT EASTERN TEST RANGE (ETR)\nAt the same time the Pt. Loma specimens were being tested, a series of dogbone\nspecimens was also being exposed at ETR. Most of these specimens were newly man\xc2\xad\nufactured and did not represent corroded tank section joints as tested at Pt. Loma.\nThe objectives of the ETR tests included investigation of the effect of undissolved grain\nboundary carbides, the application frequency of the corrosion control compound\n(WD-40), and the effectiveness of the compound\'s ability to inhibit further corrosion in\npreviously corroded joints. This section documents the testing of the ETR dogbone\nspecimens.\n6.1\n\nTEST PROCEDURE\n\nThe test specimens consisted of thirty-two 36- by 4-inch standard "dogbones" made\nfrom CRES 301 EH material (0-71004) with the exception that two of the specimens\nwere made from 5013 weld joints (see Section 5). The details of the specimens are\ngiven in Convair Drawing SK671-2-120, Test Specimens - Tank Corrosion Test (Ref\xc2\xad\nerence 12). Each specimen was made up of four 4-inch-wide standard "spot-seam\xc2\xad\nspot" overlap weld joints. The specimens were fabricated to the usual flight vehicle\nstandards of workmanship and inspection. Figure 6-1 shows the typical specimen\njoints and the materials used.\nThe variables are shown in Table 6-1. They consisted of the amount of undissolved\ngrain boundary carbides, the WD-40 application interval, and the stress condition\n(unloaded or dead weight loaded so that a constant tensile stress of 12.5 ksi was applied\nacross the weld joint.)\nThe specimens were exposed in vertical chains of two specimens per chain on the\nfourth level of the ETR Complex 36A service tower (see Figures, 6-2 and 6-3). This\nlevel is adjacent to the Atlas fuel tank. The specimens were treated periodically with\nWD-40 as specified in Table 6-1. They were subjected to periodic radiographic exam\xc2\xad\nination. The examinations were monthly for the first year and quarterly thereafter.\nThe detailed procedure for WD-40 application and other ETR activities is documented\nin Convair Procedure 55-30045-BK1 "Tank Specimens Corrosion Test" - CTP-MECH\xc2\xad\n0002, dated 02 March 1976 (Reference 20).\n6.2\n\nTEST RESULTS\n\nThe effect of the marine environment on the test specimens is given in Figures 6-4,\n6-5, and 6-6.

With the exception of specimens 30, 31, and 32, which had WD-40 applied\nonly when they were initially exposed, the specimens had no protection during their\nentire exposure.\nIn a manner similar to the Pt.

One could argue, however, that specimens 3, 10, 19, 20,\nand 21 were also essentially defect free. These specimens had no WD-40 protection.\nIt appears that, as usual, corrosion is a statistical process and in the relatively non\xc2\xad\ncorrosive environment of the service tower clear-cut results were not obtained.\nFigures 6-5 and 6-6 document the results of 19 dogbone specimens that were protected\neither every 30 or 90 days with WD-40. Specimen 29, which was made from 5013\njoints, had initial corrosion. WD-40 was effective in stopping any further significant\nincrease in corrosion. All of the other protected specimens showed no signs of cor\xc2\xad\nrosion whatsoever. It is what one would expect, however, based on the Pt. Loma\nspecimen results (Section 5). It should also be kept in mind that these WD-40 applica\xc2\xad\ntions were made in a very controlled manner according to explicit engineering instruc\xc2\xad\ntions. It should also be noted that the service tower environment the specimens were\nexposed to may\'be somewhat different from that experienced by a tank section. Cryo\xc2\xad\ngenic tanking, residue being washed onto the surface, or other unknown factors were\nnot completely duplicated for the test specimens. Their material makeup and general\nexposure location were the main similarities to the 5013 tank.\n6.4\n\nSECTION CONCLUSIONS\n\n1. \t Undissolved grain boundary carbides do not appear to cause significant corrosion.\n2. \t The ETR Complex 36A service tower environment is less aggressive to dogbone\ntest specimens than Pt. Loma.\n3. \t The results of this ETR test showed that proper application of WD-40 either\ninitially, every 30 days, or every 90 days provides complete protection of typical\nspotwelded CRES joints when exposed to a service tower environment. However,\nbased on the results obtained on specimens with no protection, it is concluded that\nthe test environment may have been less aggressive than could be typically\nexpected on a tank section. Periodic application of the corrosion control compound\nwould be prudent.\n4. \t The corrosion control compound is effective in inhibiting further corrosion in\npreviously corroded joints.\n\n6-9\n\n\n\nSECTION 7\nPERSISTENCE OF CORROSION INHIBITOR WD-40\nConsiderable interest has been shown In persistence data for WD-40 in order to deter\xc2\xad\nmine reasonable times for renewal.\nSeveral direct and indirect methods were tried to determine realistic values.\nfollowing tests were performed:\n7.1\n\nThe\n\nTEST OBJECTIVES\n\na. \t Sampling of the 5013 tank at corroded and noncorroded areas.\nb. \t Direct weighing of a sample of WD-40 exposed to air as a function of time and the\ndirect weighing of a subsize joint specimen filled with WD-40.\nc. \t Sampling of a new, full-sized (10-foot diameter) joint as a function of time.\nd. \t Monitoring the corrosion activity of 4-inch joints in a corrosive environment, as\na function of time and WD-40 treatment. The results of these last tests are\nreported in Sections 5 and 6. The other tests are reported here.\n7.2\n\nSAMPLING OF THE 5013 TANK\n\nFourteen samples such as shown in Figures 7-1 and 7-2 were submitted to infrared\nabsorption analysis to determine the hydrocarbon content, which is related to the\nWD-40 content. The initial samples B and F were taken while the tank was still at\nETR. The remainder were taken at Plant 19 at San Diego. Where the samples were\ntaken from the tank is shown in Figure 7-3.\nThe identification, condition of the surface of specimens, and results of the WD-40\nanalysis are shown in Table 7-1. Sample B represents one of the most corroded areas\nand is shown in Figure 7-1. Sample F, shown in Figure 7-2, is typical of a noncor\xc2\xad\nroded area. Further details are found in Reference 2.\nA review of the data in Table 7-1 shows good correlation between rusty samples and\nlow WD-40 and clean samples and high WD-40. Samples 3 and 5 are notable excep\xc2\xad\ntions. Sample 3 was clean and had low WD-40. This could be explained by the possi\xc2\xad\nbility that no corrosive reached this area. Sample 5, on the other hand, measured\nhigh on WD-40 and had slight corrosion. Some rust may have been transported from\nan adjacent area because water marks are definite on the specimen.\n\n7-1\n\n65343,18\n\nFigure 7-1.\n\nSample B Cut from 5013 Tank\n\nFigure 7-2.\n\nSample F Cut from 5013 Tank\n\n65343-19\n\n\n7-2\n\nVnOn\n\nCtB\n\noF\n\n510\n\n1\n\n5430\n\n1\n\n\n\n3\n\n4\n\n3\n\n4\n\n\n\n6\n\n1\n\n6\n\n591\n\n7\n\n\n\n61\n\n10\n\n\n9\n\n562\n\n9\n\n10\n\n\n\n1\n\n6440\n\n4\n\n3\n\n673\n\n6\n\n702\n\n7\n\n1\n\n731\n\n9\n1\n\n76010\n\n0\xc2\xa90\n\n9\n940\n\n10\n\n\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n\n\n962 0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n992 0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n\n\n1025 0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n1057 0\n\n1-\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6 (D 7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12C\n\nloo 0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n68\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n120\n\n1122\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4 @\n\n5\n\n6\n\n9\n\n10 @\n\n11\n\n12\n\n1133 0\n\n1\n2\nQUAD 1\n\n3\n\n4\n5\nQUAD 2\n\n7G) 8\n6\n\n7\n8\nQUAD 3\n\n9\n\nF\n\n\n\n0A\n\n10\n1100\nQUAD 4\n\n1160 (1Z 13) CONE(\n1175 (38) CONE\n\n@\n\nFigure 7-.\n\n65343-20\n\nLocatiop of Samples Taken for WD-40 Analysis\n7-3\n\nTable 7-1.\n\nResults of WD-40 Analysis of 5013 Tank Specimens\nWD-40\nSurface Condition\n\n1- g/cm 2\n\n1 - 906QI\n\nsl. stain, oily\n\n55\n\n2 - 906Q2\n\nstained, dry\n\n3 - 906Q3\n\nclean, dry\n\n4 - 906Q4\n\nstained, sl. oil\n\n105\n\n5 - 1057 (6-7)\n\nsl. rust, dry\n\n152\n\n6 - 1090 (6-7)\n\nsl. rust, sl. oil\n\n48\n\n7 - 1122 (1-2)\n\nstained, sl. oil\n\n75\n\n8 - 1122 (4-5)\n\nsl. stain, oily\n\n105\n\n9-\n\nsl. stain, sl. oil\n\n199\n\nSample No.\n\n1122 (8)\n\n134\n16\n\n10 - 1122 (11)\n\nclean, oily\n\n69\n\n11 - 1160 (12-13)\n\nrusty, dry\n\n5\n\n12 - 1175 (7-8)\n\nno rust, sl. oil\n\nB -1057\n\n(8)\n\nF - 1057 (7)\n\n42\n\nrust, dry\n\n0.3\n\nsl. rust, dry\n\n0.8\n\nsl. = \t slight\nOn balance these tests show: 1) that where WD-40 was found, corrosion was minimal;\n2) that the WD-40 was applied erratically to the joints but had been applied at least\nonce during the tank life in some areas; and 3) the aft conical area also suffered from\ninconsistent application of WD-40 to the joints, (Specimens 11 and 12); and 4) WD-40\nin amounts of 50Lpg/cm2 in the seam prevented corrosion.\n7.3 \t DIRECT WEIGHING OF WD-40 DURING EXPOSURE TO AIR AND IN A SUBSIZE\nJOINT SPECIMEN\nA drop of WD-40 was placed on a clean, weighed cover glass and its weight recorded\nas a function of time on a ventilated automatic balance (Figure 7-4).\nIn a similar manner, a 3-inch section of a typical joint (Figure 7-5) was weighed,\ntreated with WD-40, and reweighed. The loss in weight was followed as a function of\ntime. The results of these two tests are shown by Figure 7-6.\n7-4\n\n65343-21\n\nFigure 7-4. Automatic Weighing Balance\nA drop of WD-40, open to the air, loses 70% of its weight in the first hour; after this\nit loses only 2% in the next 30 days. This is to be expected because this is close to the\nvendors formulation for solvent and oil.\nOn the other hand, where the fluid is restricted from the air as in the joint, Figure\n7-6 shows that the initial evaporation is much slower. It finally reaches equilibrium\nat about 30 days with 35%retained. After that, the loss is very low even out to one year.\nIt is probable that with time the oil thickens due to air oxidation and by dust accumula\xc2\xad\ntion.\nThese direct tests, independent of variation in gap thickness or application technique,\nclearly show that WDl-40 does not lose its effectiveness because of evaporation.\nAccumulation of soil or other factors may reduce its effectiveness. These factors are\ninvestigated by corrosion tests reported in Sections 5 and 6.\nIEPPODUCIBLrY OF THE\n7-5\n\nPTC n\'A\n\n-\n\n\' r POR\n\no\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\nW0-40\'_\n\n6534$,22\n\nFigure 7-5.\n7.4\n\nSubsize Specimen of Typical Joint\n\nSAMPLING OF A NEW FULL-SIZED TANK JOINT AS A FUNCTION OF TIME\n\nThere was some concern that WD-40 could not be effectively applied to a full joint\nbecause there were no sides for the displaced air to escape as in the 4-inch dogbone\nspecimens. There was also concern that repeated condensation of water on the tank\nwould wash away the oil; consequently, a full-sized hoop containing two seams was\nsecured from the 5013 tank (Figure 7-7) for test.\nThe upper interior seam was chosen for test because it had not been previously treated\nwith WD-40, while the outside seams were questionable.\nAfter general cleaning, the seam was treated with WD-40 according to the currently\nrequired procedure: GD/C E.S. 0-79026J (8-26-77). The seam was then divided into\nquadrants, and each quadrant was divided into two segments - one of which received\nweekly water spray. The procedure for applying moisture weekly is shown in Figure\n7-8. One sample was taken from each quadrant for each condition for each time period.\nThe 1 by 1/2 cm samples for WD-40 analysis were removed by careful grinding as\nshown in Figure 7-9. The samples were taken about 10 cm apart so that the sample to\nbe taken at the next time period would not be affected by a nearby open edge.\n\n7-6\n\n100\n\n0 WD-40 LIQUID\nA SPOTWELDED SPECIMEN\n\n90\n80\n\n........\n...\n\n70o\nIA-\n\nS\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n10\n\n"\n\nTIME (days)\ni\n5\n\nI\n10\n\nI\n50\n\nI\n100\n\nI\n300\n\nI\n1000\n\nI\n3000\n\n10\n\n10,000\n\nTIME (ninutes)\n\nFigure 7-6.\n\nWD-40 Weight Loss as a Function of Time\n\n20 30\n30,000\n\n60\n\n100\n\n100,000\n\n200 300 500 650\n1\n600,000 106\n65343-23\n\n65343-24\n\n\nFigure 7-7.\n\nFull-Size Hoop Section of 5013 Tank Used for WD-40 Persistence Test\n\n66343-25\n\n\nFigure 7-8.\n\nWeekly Application of Water Spray to Seam\n7-8\n\n\n\n65343"26\n\nFigure 7-9.\n\nSampling Seam for WD-40 Determination\n\nSampling was done initially and at 1, 7, 14, 30, 60, 90, and 160 days. The residual\nWD-40 as a function of time, sample location, and water spray is shown in Figures\n7-10 and 7-11. A study of this data shows random values for both the water-sprayed\nareas and nonsprayed areas. The expected gradual decrease in residual WD-40 is not\napparent.\nAt this point, a test was performed to determine the precision of the residual WD-40\ntest. A thin sheet of stainless steel was uniformly coated with WD-40 to a thickness\nsimilar to the average seam results. The precision data In Figure 7-12 clearly shows\nthat the variations in Figures 7-10 and 7-11 cannot be explained by variations in the\nWD-40 determination.\nIn a further effort to explain the data, measurements were made of the thickness and\ndepth of the void volume of the seam as a function of the length of the seam. The void\nsize data is plotted in Figure 7-13 in such a way that it can be compared with the resid\xc2\xad\nual WD-40 data as a function of position along the seam. From these comparisons the\nfollowing conclusions can be drawn.\n\nOF Trig\noRIGINAL\n7-9\n\n\n\npAG\n\nIS pOOR\n\no DEG\n\n\n\n02\nWD-40\n\npgO/cm\n\n2\n\n(1SIDE)\n\n1\n\n14\n\n7\n\n30\nTIME (days)\n\n60\n\n90\n\n160\n\n4 IN.\n65343.2?\n\nFigure 7-10. \t Persistence of WD-40 as a Functia of Time and Sample\nLocation (No Water)\n\n45 BEG \t\n\n90 DEG\n\n(12\nWD-40\n\n1\npg6/cm\n\n2\t\n\n__\n\n_\n\n_\n\n_\n\n_\n\n_\n\n_\n\n_\n\n_\n\n_\n\n_\n\n_\n\n_\n\n_\n\n_\n\n_\n\n_\n\n_\n\n_\n\n_\n\n_\n\n_\n\n_\n\n_\n\n_\n\n_\n\n(1SIDE)\n\n04\n\nC03\n1714 \t\n\n30\n\nso\n\n90\n\n160\n\nTIME (days)\n65343-28\n\nFigure 7-11. \t Persistence of WD-40 as a Function of Time and Sample\nLocation (Water Spray)\n7-10\n\n0 DEG\n200 i\n\n\',\n\nIiii\n\nH\'02\n\niT7 TTFiiT\n-\n\n1\n120\n\n0\n\nE\n\n360 DEG\n\n270\n\n180\n\n90\n\n-\n\nH20\n\nH\nH2\n\n0\n\n1000\n\nIi [\n000 1 14 60 160 1 14 60 160\n7 30 90\n7 30 90\n0.300\n\n1\nTIME (days)\n\nM\n\n-1\n11460110\n7 30 90\n\npg\n-Z275 SUBSIZE\n-,.,,p100/g 5013 GOOD\n-*16o013 BAD\n\n0.020\n\n0.00\n\n0.200\n\n--\n\n~0.010\n\nVOID SIZE/PLACE\n\n65343-30\n\nFigure 7-13.\n\nComparison of Void Size and Residual WD-40 as a Function of Seam Length and li1me\n\nSECTION 8\nDISCUSSION\nA summary of all of the test results from all of the sections of this report indicates\nthat the major objectives of the test program were satisfied.\n8.1 \t METALLURGICAL ANALYSIS\nThe results of the metallurgical analysis clearly show that the leakage observed was\ncaused by corrosion: specifically, stress corrosion that is shown to occur in a typical\nmanner in the aft portion of the overlap joint exposed to the outside environment,\naround spotwelds, and near the resistance seamweld. These types are characterized\nby metallurgical sections and related to X-ray images for future use in interpreting\nradiographs.\nSeveral peripheral discoveries were made as a result of the metallurgical analyses.\na. \t The existence of a surface layer of low carbide material on each side of the 301\nstainless steel sheet. This may explain why nominal high carbide material\nseems to have about the same surface corrosion resistance as low carbide material.\nb. \t The existence of a laminar, metal-nonmetal structure in some of the pitting\n\n\ncorrosion observed.\n\n\n.c. \t\n\nExistence of exceptionally deep and narrow edge pitting on specimens exposed to\nthe Pt. Loma seacoast environment. This last discovery is of no consequence as\nfar \tas the Atlas/Centaur tanks are concerned because they have no exposed end\ngrain, but it does explain why several specimens failed in the base metal rather\nthan \tin the corroded joint.\n\n8.2 \t CHEMICAL ANALYSIS\nThe \tchemical analysis of the corrosion products found between the faying surfaces of\nthe joint showed the major contaminant to be sea salt and sand from the ETR area.\nThis is consistent with the fact that unprotected type 301 EH Stainless Steel can be\ncorroded by sea salt, especially in the presence of crevices.\nThe fact that unprotected specimens, exposed in the Complex 36A tower for the subse\xc2\xad\nquent two years, did not corrode as badly as the 5013 tank suggests that more, or a\nstronger corrosive was present during the time 5013 was on the stand. Extensive\nchemical analysis has not found such a. corrosive. Variation in yearly weather may\nbe the answer. Another variable that might explain the mild corrosion on the ETR\n8-1\n\n\n\ndogbone specimens is the liquid-oxygen tanking that occurred near the beginning of\nthe 5013 tank exposure (1973). If the tank had accumulated dust and sea salt, water\nfrom the frost, from the liquid-oxygen tanking, could transport the salt down across\nand into the seams. The test specimens did not experience this treatment. There\nwas some evidence of condensate frofl normal dew running down the panels but not\nto the extent experienced by the tank.\n8.3 MECHANICAL PROPERTIES\nBoth the static and fatigue strength of joints made from the 5013 tank were above\nengineering requirements. This indicates that the design can withstand considerable\ncorrosion damage without jeopardizing its structural strength. The fuel leaks that\nresulted from the corrosion poses a problem not treated here.\nStatic and fatigue tests were performed on similar specimens made from the 5013 tank\nand further exposed to 18 months at Pt. Loma. These results also exceeded engineer\xc2\xad\ning requirements. There was a 12% total loss in static strength and an increase in\nfatigue strength. The variable nature of the fatigue data on corroded specimens when\ncompared with the noncorroded data precludes the use of corrosion to increase fatigue\nstrength.\n8.4 PT. LOiVIA TESTS\nThe Pt. Loma tests clearly show the value of WD-40 in preventing corrosion in new\nspecimens and arresting previous corrosion. The tests also showed that after a\nyear of monthly application of WD-40, no new corrosion appeared upon going to a\n90 day application schedule.\n8.5 ETR TESTS\nThe exposure of dogbone specimens, made from new material, at ETR for two years\ndid not show nearly the corrosion that was experienced by the 5012 tank. The corro\xc2\xad\nsion that did occur was only on unprotected specimens. This supported the Pt. Loma\nresults that WD-40 is effective in preventing corrosion of stainless steel joints. This\ndata would indicate that even initial application of the WD-40 is adequate for two-year\nprotection. The fact that some of the controls without WD-40 did not corrode detracts\nfrom the validity of this result.\nThe corrosion of the specimens representing various amounts of undissolved carbides\nwas random in nature and could not be correlated. This fits with the fact that there\nis a surface layer of zero undissolved carbide on all specimens regardless of the\ninternal carbide level.\n\n8-2\n\n8.6 WD-40 PERSISTENCE TESTS\nDirect weighing of a typical WD-40 treated joint specimen as a function of time gave\nthe best results for the persistence of the fluid in the joint. After the loss of the\nsolvent, the remaining 35% of the WD-40 remains in the joint. Direct chemical\nanalysis of the joints on 5013 indicated very low WD-40 levels where corrosion\noccurred. Higher levels were recorded where there was no corrosion.\nThe full scale joint test showed that the .amount of WD-40 in a joint varied as the void\nvolume and was not appreciably reduced by time or simulated condensate running over\nthe seam.\n\n8-3\n\n\n\nSECTION 9\nCONCLUSIONS\nDetailed conclusions are at the end of each section. Conclusions that answer the\ninitial objectives of the program are summarized here.\nPHASE I\n1. \t Radiographic, metallographic, and chemical analysis data were obtained that\nclearly show the corrosion defects observed to be due to pitting and stress cor\xc2\xad\nsion cracking caused by the intrusion of sea salt, a humid environment, and\nresidual welding stresses in a overlapping crevice joint.\n2. \t After the evaporation of solvent the remaining 35% of WD-40 remains in the\nAtlas/Centaur seams and does not evaporate.\n3. \t\n\nThe static and fatigue properties of the corroded weld joints were determined\nand found to be above engineering requirements.\n\n4. \t Extensive tests have shown WD-40 to be effective in preventing corrosion in\nAtlas/Centaur welded joints for over 18 months in a seacoast environment.\nThey also show that VD-40 arrests previously initiated corrosion for over 18\nmonths (Pt. Loma Tests).\n5. \t\n\nThe correlation between nine categories of defect images in radiographs with\nmetallographic sectional evidence in resistance-welded, overlap joints in\ncold-worked 301 stainless steel sheet has been accomplished and is documented\nphotographically in Figures 2-6 through 2-37. This group of photographs is\nconsidered to be a Standard, enabling improved interpretation of radiographs\nof similar material and joint configuration.\nPHASE I ETR TESTS\n\n1. \t The degree of undissolved carbide appears to have no effect on typical joint\nspecimens, but the lack of significant corrosion on control specimens does not\nvalidate the data.\n2. \t\n\nWD-40 appeared to give protection at initial, 30-day or 90-day application;\nhowever, again the control specimens did not corrode appreciably.\n\n3. \t No further significant corrosion occurs on corroded specimens treated with\nVD-40 and exposed at ETR. The corroded control specimen also did not\n9-1\n\n\n\ndevelop significant additional corrosion. The Pt. Loma tests, however, show\nconclusively the effectiveness of WD-40 in preventing further corrosion of\nprecorroded specimens.\n\n9-2\n\n\n\nSECTION 10\nRE CO1IVrENDATIONS\n1. \t Based upon the results of this program it is recommended that the current\ncorrosion protection requirements as outlined in Engineering Specification\n0-79026J be continued without any relaxation for Atlas/Centaur vehicles.\n2. \t\n\nEmphasis should be placed on the uniform application of WD-40 to the joints\nthat are subsequently covered thus preventing renewal of the coating.\n\n3. \t Specimens exposed at ETR on Complex 36A corroded only to a limited degree.\nAs a result, definitive data on the required frequency of application of WD-40\nand the effect of high undissolved carbides was not obtained. These specimens\nare available for continued test. It is recommended that they be exposed at\nPt. Loma, unloaded, until meaningful data can be obtained.\n4. \t The effect of hoop loads on the corrosion defects was not investigated.\nMetallurgical Specimen No. 3, containing defects vhich yielded slightly due\nto tanking loads, is available for static tensile or fatigue tests. This type of\ndefect is shown in Figure 2-32.\nIt is recommended that a specimen be designed and prepared from this material\nto determine the fatigue life of this type of defect at expected hoop loads.\n\n10-1\n\n\n\nSECTION 11\nREFERENCES\n\n\n1. \t\n\n"AC-33 Atlas Fuel Tank Leakage Investigation," General Dynamics Convair\n\n\nAerospace Division Sales Order, Ref TD 094-105, 2 January 1975, p. 1.\n\n\n\n2. \t D.
