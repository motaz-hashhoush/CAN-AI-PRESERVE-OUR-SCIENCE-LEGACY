The type of satellite is known in advance, and a model of the satellite (which exists from its design) is used in this task. The model base is used to generate multiple smart filters of the various parts of the satellite, which are used in a symbolic multi-filter optical correlator. The output from the correlator is then treated as a symbolic description of the object, which is operated upon by an optical inference processor to determine the position and orientation of the satellite and to track it as a function of time. The knowledge and model base also serves to generate the rules used by the inference machine. The inference machine allows for feedback to optical correlators or feature extractors to locate the individual parts of the satellite and their orientations.", "title": "Model-based satellite acquisition and tracking", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-13T23:54:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19890024387, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Casasent, David"}, "organization": {"name": "Carnegie-Mellon Univ.", "location": "Pittsburgh, PA, United States"}}, "id": "ca96fea030044ba788312f5d77a4b043"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19890024387, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Lee, Andrew J."}, "organization": {"name": "Carnegie-Mellon University", "location": "Pittsburgh, PA, United States"}}, "id": "a36598ae639f4889a1c159656113787b"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-18T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 19890024387, "endDate": "1987-11-06T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "SPIE"}}, "meetingId": "50d624251aad406291b79204562e2068", "id": "a40ccc5b7cb849c38ad1f93e9c8590a3"}], "name": "Intelligent Robots and Computer Vision", "location": "Cambridge, MA", "id": "50d624251aad406291b79204562e2068", "startDate": "1987-11-02T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "id": 19890024387, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19890024387, "id": "8a56792d6ee1466a9250f8f9010181ab", "publicationDate": "1988-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
