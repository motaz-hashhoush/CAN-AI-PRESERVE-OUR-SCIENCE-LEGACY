A relationship, in terms of the angle between the interplanetary magnetic field vector and the magnetospheric field vector, is defined by which the growth of geomagnetic storms is closely associated with the Poynting flux. It is found that the energy flux that enters the magnetosphere is dissipated through intramagnetospheric substorm processes. Geomagnetic storm phenomena represent the combined influence of such effects.", "title": "A study of geomagnetic storms", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-09T11:40:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19780066604, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Perreault, P."}, "organization": {"name": "Alaska Univ.", "location": "Fairbanks, AK, United States"}}, "id": "d7290b1e72fa4b23a552bcb25847bb6e"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19780066604, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Akasofu, S.-I."}, "organization": {"name": "Alaska, University", "location": "Fairbanks, Alaska, United States"}}, "id": "1e17a6b56a4542c79bbd4e9f31f7a8b2"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Reprint (Version printed in journal)", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-16T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19780066604, "publications": [{"volume": "54", "submissionId": 19780066604, "id": "4fce331a9d374b79a70e91bb011e39b2", "publicationName": "Geophysical Journal", "publicationDate": "1978-09-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
