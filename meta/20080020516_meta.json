Propulsion health management flight objectives for the aircraft include mapping of the High Pressure Compressor in order to calibrate a Pratt and Whitney engine model and the fusion of data collected from existing sensors and signals to develop models, analysis methods and information fusion algorithms. An additional health manage flight objective is to demonstrate that the Commercial Modular Aero-Propulsion Systems Simulation engine model can successfully execute in real time onboard the C-17 T-1 aircraft using engine and aircraft flight data as inputs. Future work will address aircraft durability and aging, airframe health management, and propulsion health management research in the areas of gas path and engine vibration.", "title": "NASA C-17 Usage Overview", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-24T05:46:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20080020516, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Miller, Christopher R."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Dryden Flight Research Center", "location": "Edwards, CA, United States"}}, "id": "805f4d275c0f44c0a99a68244692d8fe"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-04-09T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20080020516, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20080020516, "id": "579e6a2caccc4e03bf5ed7804e180ddc", "publicationDate": "2008-04-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20080020516.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20080020516/downloads/20080020516.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20080020516/downloads/20080020516.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20080020516/downloads/20080020516.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
