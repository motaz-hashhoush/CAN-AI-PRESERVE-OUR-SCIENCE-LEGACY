Physical phenomena  investigated for this purpose include X-ray and gamma radiation, electrical noise, IR and UV radiation, and vibration energy. The technique selected must be capable of detecting the onset and evaluating the  progression of conditions that represent basic causes which could lead to failure. As a result of the investigation, techniques based on acoustic energy release were selected as the most promising for incipient failure detection.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"submissionId": 19720035163, "endDate": "1971-10-21T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "Annual International Air Safety Seminar", "location": "Mexico City, US", "id": "a9c7334efb6d4c24b7065d4d4612073e", "startDate": "1971-10-18T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 19720035163, "id": "4b89cff1d3684df6878b6533418deab9", "publicationDate": "1971-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
