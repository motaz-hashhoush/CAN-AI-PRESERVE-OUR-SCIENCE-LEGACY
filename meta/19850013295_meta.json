Gauge factor variation with temperature, apparent strain, and drift were included. Results of gauge factor versus temperature tests show gauge factor decreasing with increasing temperature. The average slope is -3-1/2 percent/100 K, with an uncertainty band of + or - 8 percent. Values of room temperature gauge factor for the Chinese and Kanthal A-1 gauges averaged 2.73 and 2.12, respectively. The room temperature gauge factor of the Chinese gauges was specified to be 2.62. The apparent strain data for both the Chinese alloy and Kanthal A-1 showed large cycle to cycle nonrepeatability. All apparent strain curves had a similar S-shape, first going negative and then rising to positive value with increasing temperatures. The mean curve for the Chinese gauges between room temperature and 100 K had a total apparent strain of 1500 microstrain. The equivalent value for Kanthal A-1 was about 9000 microstrain. Drift tests at 950 K for 50 hr show an average drift rate of about -9 microstrain/hr. Short-term (1 hr) rates are higher, averaging about -40 microstrain for the first hour. In the temperature range 700 to 870 K, however, short-term drift rates can be as high as 1700 microstrain for the first hour. Therefore, static strain measurements in this temperature range should be avoided.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 19850013295, "endDate": "1985-03-28T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "High Temperature Measurements for Experimental Mechanics Conf.", "location": "Knoxville, TN", "id": "be45972b17424bc08ef8f9bd0759871f", "startDate": "1985-03-27T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 19850013295, "id": "59364f1df64c404fa111c6289bad6a40", "publicationDate": "1985-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19850013295.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19850013295/downloads/19850013295.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19850013295/downloads/19850013295.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19850013295/downloads/19850013295.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
