In particular, data from RPAs combine high-resolution imagery\navailable from low flight elevations with comprehensive areal coverage, unattainable\nfrom ground investigations and difficult to acquire from manned aircraft due to budgetary\nand logistical costs. Low flight elevations are particularly important for detecting signals\nthat decay exponentially with distance, such as electromagnetic fields. Onboard data\nprocessing coupled with high-bandwidth telemetry open up opportunities for real-time\nand near real-time data processing, producing more efficient flight plans through the use\nof payload-directed flight, machine learning and autonomous systems. Such applications\nnot only strive to enhance data collection, but also enable novel sensing modalities and\ntemporal resolution. NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Airborne Science Program has been refining the\ncapabilities and applications of RPA in support of satellite calibration and data product\nvalidation for several decades. In this paper, we describe current platforms, payloads, and\nonboard data systems available to the research community. Case studies include Fluid\nLensing for littoral zone 3D mapping, structure from motion for terrestrial 3D\nmultispectral imaging, and airborne magnetometry on medium and small RPAs.\nKey Words: Remotely Piloted Aircraft, Data Collection, Data Processing\n\n'
