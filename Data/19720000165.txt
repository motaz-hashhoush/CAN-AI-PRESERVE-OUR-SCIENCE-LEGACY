For subsequent synchronous demodulation, the output signal\nmust have a negligible phase shift and very low input\nnoise at the AC carrier frequency.\n\n(R4, 116) is used in the source connections to Q8\nfor maximum common mode rejection. It is possible\nto increase common mode rejection about 8 dB by\ntrimming R4, but adequate rejection is achieved\nChopper Drive\n\n# 1 In\np\t\n\nIIC5j\n\nOutput\n\nThe solution:\nAn amplifier which chops input signals (because\nthe input signal levels are much lower than the input\ndrift of available solid state devices); the resulting\nAC signal is RC-coupled to the input stage of other\namplifiers.\n\nHow it's done:\nThe input DC signal is modulated full wave by\ntwo pairs of matched-junction field-effect transistors\nQi, Q2. A two-phase chopper driver signal alternately turns off one pair of transistors with a reverse\nbias voltage and allows the other pair to conduct at\nzero bias. The signal input is reversed every half\ncycle, producing a full wave differential signal to\nthe input RC coupling network (C2, R3, C5, R9).\nThe differential input signal is applied to the gates\nof a matched dual junction FET (Q3), which has\nexcellent noise characteristics at low current. The\namplified signal is applied to the input of a monolithic AC differential amplifier: closed-loop feedback\nis achieved by a feedback resistor between the output and the source connection of Q3. Closed loop\ngain is set by the ratio of the feedback resistor R14\nto the Q3(2) source resistor R8.

Capacitor CS is matched to C9\nfor increased high frequency rejection.\n\nNotes:\n1. Test results indicate that the amplifier has a 3-dB\nnoise figure for source impedance of 15,000 ohms,\nimproving with higher impedance. Common mode\nrejection is 94 to 100 dB without trimming. The\npower requirement is low, 0.6 mA from plus and\nminus 14-volt sources (17 mW).\n(continued overleaf)\n\nThis document was prepared under the sponsorship of the National\nAeronautics and Space Administration.
