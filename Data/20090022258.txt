b'Bird Vision System\nThe Bird Vision system is a multicamera photogrammerty software application that\nruns on a Microsoft Windows XP platform and was developed at Kennedy Space\nCenter by ASRC Aerospace. This software system collects data about the locations of\nbirds within a volume centered on the Space Shuttle and transmits it in real time to the\nlaptop computer of a test director in the Launch Control Center (LCC) Firing Room. The qualitycontrolled bird location data is also transmitted to the Firing Room bird tracking console, starting\nat the end of the T\xe2\x80\x939-minute hold. This data is available until T\xe2\x80\x9360 seconds, when the tracker\noperators take control of the cameras and the Bird Vision application is terminated. This system\nuses the pad tracking cameras at three camera sites located about 1,200 feet from the pad, near the\ninside of the pad perimeter. The Bird Vision system backs up the Bird Radar system and includes the\nfollowing features:\n\nSpaceport/Range\nSituational\nAwareness\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t 3-D Model Plot Mode (both local and remote overlay displays) provides real-time rotation,\nzoom, and translation of the 3-D view, using the mouse controls against a 3-D CAD model\nbackground and terrain map. There are several views for this display, including top view, side\nview, perspective view, and flyby view (rotating perspective view), which can be set via the 3-D\nModel Settings Tab.\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t 3-D Overlay Plot Mode (both local and remote overlay displays) provides real-time rotation,\nzoom, and translation of the 3-D view, using the mouse controls.\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t Triangulation (both local and remote overlay displays): For every pair of cameras set to\nBroadcast Mode, a circle is plotted on the 2-D overlay if the intersecting camera view lines\npass within a maximum distance threshold, thus indicating a high probability of a bird at that\nlocation in 3-D space. The user may select the maximum distance threshold (the default is\n2.5 m). A solid sphere is plotted in the 3-D Plot Mode where two camera view lines pass within\nthis maximum distance threshold.\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t The Bird Track (local overlay display only) generates a pseudo bird track by plotting a history\nof triangulated positions and then applying a fading-color function to the plot symbol. This\nfeature is enabled when the number of history plots equals a nonzero value under the Bird\nVision system control panel. The default value is 1.\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t The system has the ability to record all processed data (camera view lines as well as triangulated\npositions) sent to the LCC Bird Vision remote display. This feature allows the test director to\nreview all bird tracking data immediately following a launch or a scrub.\n\nVision system calibration is accomplished by marking\nthe top and bottom positions of the pad lightning mast\nstructure.\n\n60\n\nRange Technologies\n\nManually drawing exclusive regions of interest helps mitigate\nfalse detections from background noise.\n\nPlot Overlay Mode, where a yellow circle represents the 3-D intersection of all pairs of twocamera view lines to a detected object (bird).\n\n3-D Model Plot Mode.\n\nContact: Dr. John E.
