Subjects performed arm\npointing movements by drawing on a digitizing tablet, with targets and movement trajectories\ndisplayed in real time on a computer monitor. Adaptation was induced by presenting the\ntrajectories in an altered gain format on the monitor. The subjects were shown visual displays of\ntheir movements that corresponded to either 0.5 or 1.5 scaling of the movements made. Subjects\nwere assigned to three groups: the head orientation group tilted the head towards the right\nshoulder when drawing under a 0.5 gain of display and towards the left shoulder when drawing\nunder a 1.5 gain of display, the target orientation group had the home & target positions rotated\ncounterclockwise when drawing under the 0.5 gain and clockwise for the 1.5 gain, the arm\nposture group changed the elbow angle of the arm they were not drawing with from full flexion\nto full extension with 0.5 and 1.5 gain display changes. To determine if contextual cues were\nassociated with display alternations, the gain changes were returned to the standard (1.0) display.\nAftereffects were assessed to determine the efficacy of the head orientation contextual cue. .\ncompared to the two control cues. The head orientation cue was effectively associated with the\nmultiple gains. The target orientation cue also demonstrated some effectiveness while the.arm\nposture cue did not. The results demonstrate that contextual cues can be used to switch between\nmultiple adaptive states. These data provide support for the idea that static head orientation\ninformation is a crucial component to the arm adaptation process. These data further define the\nfunctional linkage between head posture and arm pointing movements.\n\nIntroduction\nEarly work examining visuomotor adaptation of arm pointing movements led to the belief\nthat only one visuomotor map existed at any given time, because subjects needed to re-adapt to a\nnormal environment following an initial adaptation to an altered environment [12-14]. Pointing\nerrors evident upon the return to the normal environment, opposite in direction to those observed\nwhen subjects were first exposed to the adaptive stimulus, have been termed aftereffects. Further\ninvestigations have since demonstrated that subjects can concurrently store two or more\nvisuomotor maps by alternately switching back and forth between environments over blocks of\ntrials [4, 7, 9, 19, 31]. Following repeated exposures, subjects require fewer trials to re-adapt and\nexhibit reduced aftereffects each time they switch between exposures. This has been\ndemonstrated with a variety of adaptive stimuli, including wedge prisms [7,19,3 1], rotated visual\nfeedback [5], varying VOR gains [25, 26, 28], and force fields perturbing the direction of limb\nmovement [10].\nShadmehr and Brashers-Krug [23] have demonstrated that time is required (possibly for\nconsolidation of learning) between exposure to multiple environments in order for subjects to be\nable to learn the new state without interference from the previous one. Furthermore, they have\ndemonstrated using PET that the ventral prefrontal cortex may be involved in the inhibition of\nthe initially acquired state during acquisition of a new one [24]. Without providing a\nconsolidation time period, Kravitz and Yaffe [18] demonstrated that auditory tones were\neffective at helping subjects switch between pointing at different magnitudes of prism shifts,\nusing a tone to signify a change between blocks. More recently, Cunningham & Welch [5]\ncompared the effectiveness of auditory and visual cues to aid switching between multiple maps.\nThe visual cue was,simply a change in color of the target and cursor whenever the magnitude of\n\n4\nfeedback rotation was altered. Their results demonstrated only weak effects for both auditory\nand visual signals, with the cues appearing to be effective for switching between some, but not\nall blocks. There are further conflicting results as to whether visual cues can be associated with\nacquired adaptations, Donderi et al. [7] demonstrated color-contingent aftereffects following\nprism exposure. Gandolfo et al. [10], however, demonstrated that subjects could not associate a\nchange in the color of the ambient room lighting with different perturbing force fields.\nShelhamer and colleagues [25, 26] examined whether subjects could associate eye\nposition with multiple gains of the vestibulo ocular reflex (VOR). They exposed subjects to\nalternating periods of VOR gain, shifting the angle of gaze with each change in gain, After\nsuccessive exposures, subjects were able to anticipate a new VOR gain automatically when the\neye position was changed. In another example, Gandolfo et al. [10] had subjects adapt to a force\nfield opposing their movement, with force magnitude proportional to the velocity of the moving\nlimb. Subjects alternated between a clockwise- and a counter clockwise-directed opposing force\nfield. Two types of stimuli were used as contextual cue conditions to aid subjects in switching\nbetween the two states. The first was color; the room was flooded with one color light for the\nclockwise field and another for the counter clockwise field. This was not effective, however, in\nenabling the subjects to switch from one state to another. The other type of contextual cue\ncondition was the hand posture used to grasp the manipulandum. One posture was with the hand\nhalfway between full pronation and full supination, and the other was fully pronated, effectively\nchanging the muscle requirements to move the manipulandum. The use of these different\npostures was sufficient to enable subjects to switch automatically between the two mappings.\nThat is, after associating the mapping with the cue, as soon as the posture was changed (i.e., from\nthe first trial) subjects were able to perform movements that were appropriate for the\n\nenvironment. Similar results were obtained for goal-directed eye movements by Deubel [6] and\nClendamel et al. [3]. From the above data it appears that the contextual cues which are\neffectively associated with multiple adaptive states are those that are intrinsic to the task. This\ninterpretation would explain the effectiveness of hand posture for arm pointing adaptation in the\nGandolfo et al. [10] study and eye and head orientation for VOR adaptation observed by\nShelhamer and colleagues [25, 26, 28].\nOur previous work [20] suggests that the visuomotor map in use for arm pointing is\nfunctionally linked to that in use for head pointing, even when the head is restrained during arm\npointing. The existing literature on eye-head-hand coordination provides substantial evidence\nfor integrated, synergistic control of these body segments [2, 8, 29]. However, the bulk of these\nexperiments have included investigation of dynamic head and hand control; it remains unclear\nhow or whether static head posture is integrated into the control of arm pointing movements.\nBerger et al. [1] have demonstrated that the accuracy of arm pointing can be biased by variations\nin the head-to-trunk posture when subjects point with the eyes closed, particularly following\nmicrogravity exposure. Further support for this functional linkage between head posture and arm _- -pointing would be obtained if subjects are able to switch between acquired adaptations for arm\npointing movements using different head postures as opposed to other types of contextual cues.\nThe purpose of this experiment was to determine whether head posture is an effective\ncontextual cue for switching between visuomotor maps. It was predicted that static head\norientation could be easily incorporated into the arm adaptation process, in comparison to control\ncues. This was expected because of the linkage between head posture and arm movement\ncontrol, making head orientation an integral aspect of the task. Subjects in the head orientation\ngroup tilted the head towards the right shoulder when drawing under a 0.5 gain of display (+20\xc2\xb0\n\n6\nroll) and towards the left shoulder (-20\xc2\xb0 roll) when drawing under a 1.5 gain of display. Under\none of the control conditions, subjects changed the elbow angle of the left arm (while drawing\nwith the right arm) from full flexion to full extension with 0.5 and 1.5 gain display changes.\nUnder the other control condition, the home & target positions were rotated counterclockwise\nwhen drawing under the 0.5 gain and clockwise for the 1.5 gain. These target orientation angles\nmatched those of the head posture group. This was to rule out the possibility that changing head\norientation is effective simply because it requires an additional transformation from the drawing\nmovements made (horizontal line between targets) to the eye movements performed (oblique line\nbetween targets). This additional transformation could make the task more difficult . than under\nthe arm posture conditions, thereby making the stimulus more salient. The arm posture control\ncondition changes posture of a body segment with changes in gain; it is presumed, however, that\nposture of the left arm is not integral to the task. It was predicted that head orientation would\nprove to be more effective than the contexts created by the control conditions, since static head\norientation information is a crucial component to the arm adaptation process. The discovery of\nany contextual cue that aids subjects in switching between multiple adaptive states would be of\nbenefit to adaptive training programs. For example, the appropriate context could be used to\nhelp astronauts to switch between multiple adaptive sets, a set appropriate for microgravity, the\ngravitational environment of Mars, and the gravitational environment of Earth.\nIt also appears that almost any type of cue can become effectively associated with\nmultiple mappings following extensive alternating training periods. For example, Martin et al.\n[19] demonstrated that subjects could switch automatically between throwing with wedge prisms\nand without after six weeks of training sessions, with the only trigger being the presence or\nabsence of the lenses. Even from the first trial the subjects pointed accurately. Since Martin et\n\nal. [19] have demonstrated that some cues can become effectively associated with multiple\nmappings when using an extensive training period, a secondary experiment was conducted in\norder to determine whether the effectiveness of these contextual cue conditions is dependent on\nthe training period employed. New subjects were recruited and assigned to the same groups as in\nthe main experiment; the participants performed twice as many trials. The purpose was to\nexamine whether the two control conditions would become associated with the adaptive states\nfollowing extensive training, and/or whether the effectiveness of the head posture condition\nwould strengthen.\nMethods (mark methods for small print)\nSubjects. Three groups of twelve subjects were recruited from the Arizona State\nUniversity campus to participate. Group l subjects (4 males, 8 females) were 24.8 (sd=4.5)\nyears old; group 2 subjects (6 males, 6 females) were 25.7 (sd =4.2) years old, and group.3\nsubjects (4 males, 8 females) were 25.2 (sd =4.3) years old. After hearing an explanation of the\nexperiment the subjects decided whether they wanted to volunteer. If they did, they provided\nwritten informed consent in accordance with the institution\'s human subjects\' policies. Subjects\nwere compensated with extra credit for an undergraduate motor learning course for their\nparticipation, which took an average of one hour. An additional four subjects per group were\nrecruited to participate in the second experiment, aimed at determining how the strength of cue\nassociation increases over repeated exposures to visuomotor conflict.\nProcedure. Subjects were seated in front of a computer monitor, with their arm resting on\na digitizing tablet. The shoulder was flexed to 90\xc2\xb0 for the starting posture, and the table height\nwas adjusted to support the arm in a posture parallel to the floor. The head was fixed to a\nsupport for the duration of the experiment. Subjects grasped the stylus in a whole hand grasp to\n\n8\nprevent them from making adjustments to the pen position with their fingers. Subjects wore\ngoggles that were blacked out on the lower half to prevent vision of the moving hand. The\nsubjects performed aiming movements to various targets on a Wacom digitizer. Custom\nsoftware was used to present the imperative stimulus (auditory go signal), the targets, and the\npen trace, and to collect the x and y pen tip coordinates at 206 Hz during the course of the\nmovements. Targets were displayed on a 30 cm by 40 cm monitor, placed at eye level 60 cm\nback from the subjects\' eyes. The subjects were instructed to perform the movements as rapidly\nand as accurately as possible upon an auditory go signal. Although latency of response was not\nstressed, anticipation and no response trials were omitted by having subjects repeat trials in\nwhich they did not achieve a reaction time (RT) between 100 ms and 1000 ms. All other trials\nwere retained, regardless of whether or not the target was achieved.\nSubjects were randomly assigned to one of three groups, each receiving a different cue\ncondition: 1) subjects changed static head posture from +20\xc2\xb0 of roll (towards the right) to -20\xc2\xb0\nof roll (towards the left) with the gain of display changing from 1.5 to 0.5, 2) the target\norientation was changed by tilting the computer monitor from +20\xc2\xb0 to -20\xc2\xb0 of roll with the gain\nchanging from 1.5 to 0.5 and the head remaining fixed, 3) the left arm posture (all subjects were\nright handed and drew with their dominant hand) varied from full elbow extension to full elbow\nflexion while again the gain changed from 1.5 to 0.5.\nAll three groups performed a pre test with the gain of display at 1.0 (20 trials), an\nadaptation block in which the gain of display alternated between 0.5 and 1.5 every 20 trials for\nthree successive sets (120 trials total), and a post test (32 trials) in which the gain was returned to\n1.0 (see Table 1 for an overview of trial presentation). No cues were provided during the pre\ntest, but cues were present throughout the adaptation and post tests. The 0.5 gain of display\n\n9\n\nrequires subjects to travel twice the distance on the tablet compared to the distance displayed on\nthe monitor, and the 1.5 gain of display requires subjects to travel two thirds of the distance on\nthe tablet compared to the displayed pen trace. During the adaptation block, the level of cue was\nchanged with every gain change (i.e., head orientation went from +20\xc2\xb0 to -20\xc2\xb0 of roll, target\norientation and arm posture changed in a similar fashion). Cue levels and corresponding gains of\ndisplay are presented in Table 1.\nTo examine whether there was any interference between cue effectiveness and recency\neffects arising from the last gain experienced during the adaptation block, the groups were\nsubdivided into two. One half received one cue level for the first half of the post test (for\nexample, +20\xc2\xb0 of head roll, which was associated with the 0.5 gain during adaptation) and the\nother received the remaining cue level (for example, -20\xc2\xb0 of head roll, which was associated with\nthe 1.5 gain during adaptation). The level of cue was changed halfway through the post test (at\n16 trials) to determine whether the direction of aftereffect changed accordingly with the gain\npreviously associated with the level of cue during the adaptation block. Subjects participating in\nthe second, smaller experiment (four subjects for each of the three cue groups) followed the sameprotocol except that they performed the adaptation block two times (240 total adaptation trials)\nbefore continuing on to the post test.\nData Analysis. The position data were subjected to a residual analysis in order to\ndetermine the appropriate cutoff frequency for data filtering [33]. This method compares the\nresidual difference between the filtered and the raw data using multiple cutoff settings. Thus the\nuser can select the cutoff that maximizes noise elimination and minimizes signal distortion. The\nresulting value used was 7 Hz. The resultant path was computed by taking the square root of the\nsum of the squared x and y coordinate data. The tangential speed and acceleration profiles were\n\n10\n\nthen found by successive differentiation. The optimal algorithm of Teasdale, Bard, Fleury,\nYoung, and Proteau [27] was used to determine movement onset from the velocity profiles. The\nalgorithm works as follows: Locate the sample at which the velocity time series first exceeds\n10% of its maximum value (Vmax); working back from this point stop at the first sample (call it\nS) less than or equal to (Vmax/10)-(Vmax/100); find the standard deviation of the series between\nsample 1 and sample S (call this sd); working back from S stop at the first sample less than or\nequal to S-sd; this is the onset sample. As sampling was terminated when subjects remained\nstationary for 300 ms, the same algorithm was used in reverse to determine movement offset.\nSubjects typically perform movement corrections during adaptation experiments, evident\nas corrective submovements in the velocity profile [16, 20], especially towards the beginning of\nthe adaptation blocks when they are learning the task and adapting to the change in the gain of\ndisplay. Since the focus of interest was more in how the subjects preplanned the movements and\nless in the on-line corrections that they made, we decomposed the movement into its primary and\nsecondary submovements. The primary submovement is thought to be mostly under ballistic\ncontrol whereas the secondary submovement reflects a feedback-based correction [20]. The\nexistence of secondary submovements was determined using an algorithm that searches for a\npositive acceleration value following a period of deceleration, or a change in the sign of the\nvelocity, signifying a change in movement direction. The end of the primary submovement was\nalso considered the beginning of the secondary submovement. While it is acknowledged that\nmultiple corrective submovements may occur, they were considered as one corrective phase for\nthe purposes of this analysis. Trials not containing corrective submovements were excluded\nfrom mean calculations of secondary submovement amplitude and duration (i. e., rather than\nentering values of 0:.0 cm amplitude and 0 ms duration).\n\nUsing these methods of submovement decomposition allowed us to portion the\nmovement into ballistic and corrective phases. This enabled us to compute the distance covered\nin the primary submovement. This variable is reflective of programming errors rather than errors\nin any feedback-based corrections. For example, the primary submovement should cover\napproximately 50% of the total distance for the initial trials of the 0.5 gain of display adaptation\nblocks and 150% of the total distance for the initial trials of the 1.5 gain blocks.\nA within subjects MANOVA (group x block x trial) with repeated measures on trial and\nblock was used to determine how performance varied across each block. The Huynh-Feldt\nepsilon [15] was evaluated to determine whether the repeated measures data met the.assumption\nof sphericity (E > .75). In cases where sphericity was met, the univariate tests were used to\nmaintain power. Otherwise, the repeated measures were treated as multivariate. Note that the\nsignificance of the F value is assessed using different degrees of freedom depending on whether\nthe univariate or multivariate tests are used. The observed power was computed for all variables,\nas was w2, an estimate of the total population variance that is explained by the variation due to\nthe treatment [17]. Its value does not depend on sample size or power of the experiment. Its\nvalues can range between 0.0 and 1.0, with negative values a possibility when the associated F\nvalue is less than 1.0. Cohen suggests that a small effect is comparable to an 0 of .01, a\nmedium effect is .06, and a large effect is .15 or greater [4]. These standards were employed in\nour assessment of treatment effect sizes. Data analyses for the second experiment were identical,\nexcept that the majority of the interpretation focused on the effect sizes rather than the p values\nsince only four subjects per group participated.\n\n12\n\nResults\nThe observed power for all significant reported effects for the first experiment ranged\nfrom .86 to .99. There were small learning effects in the pre-test as subjects became\naccommodated to the task, as seen in Figure 1. The error bars have not been plotted for Figures\n1 and 3, as they obscure the visual assessment of the pattern of results for the three subject\ngroups. Further, the groups are pooled across cue condition in these plots because there were\nneither significant main effects nor interactions involving condition for the pre test and\nadaptation blocks. There were significant main effects on both block (F(1, 31) = 22.6,1? < .001,\nCO 2 = .\n\n23, large effect size) and trial (F(9, 279) = 17.9, P < .001,\n\n(1)2 = .\n\n30, large effect size) for the\n\npre test, reflecting increases in the primary submovement distance both within and across blocks\nfor all three cue groups. It should be noted that there were no group differences in performance\nat the pre test.\nSample trajectories from the adaptation block (Figure 2) reveal that subjects initially\nundershoot the target when exposed to the 0.5 gain of display and overshoot it when exposed to\nthe 1.5 gain, followed by corrections to achieve the target. This pattern of results is reflected in\nthe primary submovement distance data, presented in Figure 3. Again the groups are pooled\nacross cue condition as there were neither significant main effects nor interactions during the\nadaptation blocks. There was a significant block x trial interaction (F(45, 1395) = 29.4, p < .001,\n(2 = .\n\n44, large effect size). Follow up contrasts revealed significant linear and quadratic trends\n\nacross trials within each adaptation block (Linear trends: Block 1: F(1, 34) = 143.4, p < .001, CO\n_ .22, large effect size; Block 2: F(1, 34) = 49.5, p < .001, W2 = . 40, large effect size; Block 3:\nF(1, 34) = 84.4, p < .001, (02 = . 53, large effect size; Block 4: F(1, 34) = 66.4, p <.001, ( 0\'= .47,\nlarge effect size; Block 5: F(1, 34) = 134.0, p < .001, cn 2 = . 64, large effect size; Block 6: F(1,\n\n13\n\n34) = 46.0, p < .001, 0)2= .38, large effect size. Quadratic trends: Block 1: F(1, 34) = 21.4, p <\n.001, cut= .22, large effect size; Block 2: F(1, 34) = 110.5, p <.001, cot= .60, large effect size;\nBlock 3: FO, 34) = 38.8, p <.001, co t= .53, large effect size; Block 4: F(1, 34) = 80.0, p <\n.001, cue= .52, large effect size; Block 5: F(1, 34) = 50.0, p <.001, 6) 2= .40, large effect size;\nBlock 6: F(1, 34) = 58.4, p <.001, cu e = .44, large effect size).\nThe post-test data for experiment 1 revealed moderate effectiveness of both the target\norientation and the head posture cues (Figure 4). The groups are split by condition (level of cue)\nfor this plot, as there were significant effects involving condition during the post-test. There was\na group x block x condition interaction for the post test (F(2, 31) = 5.2, p .01, co t ^ .07, medium\neffect size). Follow up tests for block 1 of the post test revealed main effects for condition (F(1,\n31) = 10.0, p < .01, cue= .11, medium effect size). Furthermore, condition contrasts on the first\ntrial of block 1 revealed that there was no significant effect of condition for group 1 (arm posture\ncue group) (F(1., 10) = 2.02, p > .10), a trend for a condition effect with group 3 (head orientation\ncue group) (F(1, 10) = 3.3, p < .10), and a condition main effect for group 2 (target orientation\ncue group) (F(l, 10) = 15.1, p < .01). Condition contrasts on the first trial of post test block 2\nrevealed that there was no significant effect of condition for groups 1 and 2 (Group 1: F(1, 10) =\n3.03, p > .10, Group 2: F(1, 10) < 1.0, p >.10), but that there was a condition main effect for\ngroup 3 (F(1, 10) = 5.62, p <.05).\nSubjects participating in the second experiment also exhibited small learning effects\nduring the pre-test (Figure 5). There was a block by trial interaction (F9,81=2.78, p<.01, (u2= .29,\nlarge effect size), reflecting that greater changes occurred across trials in the first block in\ncomparison to the second. Similar to the first experiment, however, there were no group\ndifferences in performance from the outset of the experiment.\n\n14\n\nAs in the main experiment, there were no group differences in the disruptions in\nperformance that were seen each time the gain was changed during the first set of six adaptation\nblocks for the second experiment (upper row, Figure 6). Subjects demonstrated patterns that\nwere similar to those observed in the first experiment for these first six adaptation blocks; that is,\nthey initially undershot the target when presented with the 0.5 gain of display and overshot it\nwith the 1.5 gain, resulting in significant linear and quadratic trends across trials within each of\nthe blocks (Linear trends: Block 1: F1 ,9=24.9, p<.01, co 37, large effect size, Block 2.\n2\nF 1,9 = 16.9, p<.01, w 2 =.28, large effect size, Block 3: F1 ,9=23.5, p<.01, ( 0 =.36, Block 4:\n\nF 1,9=14.0, p<.01, (02 =.24, large effect size, Block 5: F1,9=.31, large effect size, Block 6:\nF 1,9=17.8, p<.01, CO2= . 30, large effect size. Quadratic trends: Block 1: F1,9=15.5, p<.01, CO 2=.27,\nlarge effect size, Block 2: F 1,9 = 38.6, p<.01, w 2 =.48, Block 3: F1,9=26.8, p<.01, c02 =.39, large\neffect size, Block 4: F1 ,9 = 13.0, p<.01, (J)2 =.23, large effect size, Block 5: F1 ,9=40.3, p<.01,\nw 2 =.49, large effect size, Block 6: F1,9=10.3, p=.01, ( 02 =.19, large effect size).\nThe performance disruptions occurring due to gain changes were diminished across the\nsecond set of six adaptation blocks for the head posture group, resulting in group x trial\ninteractions for some of these blocks (Figure 6, lower row; only the first five trials are plotted to\nincrease clarity of the initial group separations). Although the interactions were not always\nstatistically significant (which was not surprising given the small number of subjects\nparticipating), the effect sizes were moderate to large. These occurred in the odd-numbered\nblocks only (0.5 gain of display, Block 1: F 2,9=2.0, p>.10, 0=.20, large effect size, Block 3:\nF2,9=3.7, p<.10, 0=.40, large effect size, Block 5: F 2,9=1.9, p>.10, 0=.18, large effect size with\nboth head posture and target orientation groups differing from the arm posture cue group). There\nwere no group differences in the quadratic trends across trials in the even-numbered adaptation\n\n15\n\nblocks, in which the gain was 1.5 (trial main effects, Block 2: F 1,9= 24.3, p<.Ol, (1) 2= large\neffect size, Block\n\n4: 17 1,9=19.9,\n\np<.01, w2=.65, large effect size, Block 6: 17 1,9=.81, large effect\n\nsize).\nSimilar to Experiment 1, the post-test for the second experiment demonstrates moderate\neffectiveness of both the head posture and the target orientation cues (Figure 7). The groups\nhave been divided by condition (level of cue) to demonstrate the effectiveness of the cues. There\nwere large condition effect sizes in some cases, indicating cue effectiveness. In the first portion\nof the post test, only the head posture cue was effective (condition main effect: F 1,2=2.8, p>.10,\nw2 =.47, large effect size for the head posture group;\n\nW\n\n2 values were negative for the - other two\n\ncue groups and F<1.0). For the second portion of the post test, both the head posture and the\ntarget orientation cues were effective (condition main effect head posture: F 1,2=2.4, p>.10,\nc0 2= . 41,\n\nlarge effect size, target orientation: F 1,2=5.4, p>.10, w2=.69, large effect size, arm\n\nposture: cot was negative and F<1.0).\nDiscussion\nIt was predicted that changing head orientation would be more effective than the control\ncontextual cues to aid switching between visuomotor maps, due to the functional linkage\nbetween head and arm control. This linkage makes head orientation an integral aspect of arm\nmovement control. Indeed, this group was the only one (in the first experiment) showing a\nsignificant elevation of distance covered in the primary submovement (for subjects in the post\ntest condition level 2) when the level of cue was switched halfway through the post test block.\nThe head posture contextual cue was also consistently effective for the subjects participating in\nthe second experiment. Shelhamer and colleagues [25, 26, 28] have obtained similar results,\ndemonstrating that head and eye orientation are salient cues to associate with differing gains of\n\n16\n\nthe VOR. They found that subjects could increase the gain of the VOR while the eyes were\ndirected upward and decrease it for downwardly directed eye movements [25]. Similarly,\nGandolfo et al. [10] demonstrated that the use of different hand postures was an effective\ncontextual cue to discriminate between adaptive states for counteracting perturbing force fields.\nIt appears, therefore, that the most effective cues are those that are integral to task execution.\nThus, our results support the existence of interactions between head position and hand control,\nwith even static head postures taken into account for arm movement control. Similarly, Berger\nand colleagues [1] have demonstrated that arm pointing movements (with the eyes closed) can be\nbiased by static head posture. This effect is exaggerated by exposure to microgravity.\nCombined, these data support the idea of a functional head-hand linkage, with head orientation\ninfluencing limb control.\nThe target orientation cue also proved to be moderately effective. The fact that both of\nthese cues worked may provide some insight into the mechanisms of contextual association.\nBoth the target orientation and head posture cues resulted in subjects making oblique eye\nmovements; thus, proprioceptive information regarding eye position may have served to\ntransduce the cue information. The oblique eye movements may also have created the need for\nan additional transformation between this obliquely oriented eye movement and the horizontally\noriented movement required by the hand. This additional step could increase the task difficulty\nand enhance association of the cue.\nThe arm posture contextual cue condition was not associated at all with the gain\nexperienced during adaptation. It is not entirely surprising that the arm posture cue was\nineffective, since it did not serve to change any aspect of the task performance (subjects drew\nwith the right arm and changed posture of the left arm). It is unlikely that subjects could have\n\n17\n\nutilized the cues to formulate an explicit rule; data suggests that visuomotor adaptation does not\nincorporate such processes. For example, Welch [30] has demonstrated that prism shift\naftereffects occur even when subjects are made aware that the prism lenses have been removed.\nThe mechanism by which cues enable switching between adaptive states is unclear. They\ncould potentially facilitate priming of the appropriate visuomotor map and/or simultaneously\ninhibit the competing mappings. Shadmehr and Holcomb [24] have demonstrated that a learned\npattern needs to be inhibited before acquisition of a competing pattern can occur. Their work\nsuggests that this occurs over time (5.5 lir was sufficient for their task) and involves the ventral\nprefrontal cortex [24]. The data presented in this experiment suggest that appropriate cues can\nexpedite this process.\nThe adaptation paradigm used in the first experiment followed a relatively short time\ncourse (120 trials, approximately 20-30 minutes) in comparison to other investigations of dual\nadaptation. This likely contributed to the lack of evidence for dual adaptation appearing within\nthese training blocks. The addition of another sequence of adaptation blocks in the second\nexperiment was sufficient for subjects in the head orientation cue group to demonstrate a\nmitigation of the disruption occurring with each gain change, providing evidence of dual\nadaptation. Thus it appears that cue association is a dynamic process that evolves gradually over\ntime. Surprisingly, this occurred only when subjects performed under the 0.5 gain of display and\nnot the 1.5 gain of display. The target orientation group appeared to exhibit signs of dual\nadaptation towards the end of the second adaptation block, but there seemed to be no difference\nfor the arm posture group. It is possible that, provided adequate exposure to the alternating\nblocks, the arm posture contextual cue group would also eventually achieve dual adapted states.\nFor example, Martin et al. [19] demonstrated that subjects could switch automatically between\n\n18\n\nthrowing with wedge prisms and without after 20 training sessions over six weeks. In their\nstudy, the only cue available to the subjects was the existence of the prism lenses over the eyes.\nSimilarly, Cunningham and Welch [5] found a reduction in initial errors when subjects alternated\nbetween normal and rotated visual feedback after five hours of training. Perhaps less salient\ncontextual conditions (i.e., presence or absence of lenses) are associated with adaptive states over\nlonger periods of alternating exposures. Shelhamer and colleagues [25] investigated this by\nhaving subjects take on and off clear lenses while alternating between increased and decreased\nVOR gain for one hour, without providing any additional cues. Subjects did not exhibit context\ndependency on the glasses following this training. However, following the six weeks of prism\ntraining sessions in the experiment by Martin et al. [19], subjects were able to use the prism\nlenses as a contextual cue.\nThese results have significant implications for the design of adaptive training programs.\nFirstly, they add to the accumulating evidence that humans can simultaneously store multiple\nadaptive states [5, 7, 10, 19, 21, 25, 26, 28, 31, 321. Secondly, the data leads to a cohesive theory\nregarding the effectiveness of contextual cues to aid switching between these states. It appears\nthat even simple cues, such as wearing prismatic lenses, can be effective over many hours of\ntraining [5, 19]. The current study and others [ 10, 25, 26], however, have demonstrated that\nsome cues can also be effectively associated with an adaptive state after a short time period of\ntraining. These cues are those that are an integral aspect of the task. Additionally, the data\ndemonstrate that head orientation information is incorporated into arm movement control.\n\n19\n\nAcknowledgements\nThis work was supported by NASA NGT9-21 and NIA AG 14676.

Pre-test primary submovement distance (Panel A is right-to-left movements and Panel B is\nleft-to-right, see Table 1 for trial definitions). There was a main effect for both trial and\nblock, with all three groups increasing primary submovement distance during the pre-test.\n2. Sample position and velocity trajectories from early in the adaptation blocks. The left panels\ndepict trials from the 0.5 gain of display, characterized by target undershoots followed by\ncorrections to achieve the target. The right panels plot trials from the 1.5 gain of display,\ncharacterized by target overshoots with corrections necessary to achieve the target.\n3. Primary submovement distance across the adaptation blocks. Block numbers are defined in\nTable 1; the first half of each block consists of leftward movements while the second half are\nrightward movements. There were significant linear and quadratic trends across trials in each\nblock as subjects adapted performance to the altered gain of display within each block.\n4. Post-test primary submovement distance (1.0 gain of display, plotted by level of cue). The\nupper row plots the first 16 trials and the lower row plots the second 16 (following the\nchange in cue level). The target orientation group exhibited a cue effect for the first post-test\nblock, while the head posture group exhibited a trend for a cue effect for the first post-test\nblock and a significant cue effect for the second post-test block.\n5. Experiment Two pre test primary submovement distance (Panel A is right-to-left movements\nand Panel B is left-to-right). There was a block x trial interaction, with greater changes\noccurring across trials in the first block than in the second.\n6. Experiment Two adaptation primary submovement distance (upper row first six adaptation\nblocks, lower row second six adaptation blocks). Only the first five trials of each block are\npresented for the second set of adaptation blocks. There were significant linear and quadratic\n\n22\n\ntrends across trials in all blocks. Additionally, there were large effect sizes for the group x\ntrial interaction in blocks Al, A3, and AS of the second set of adaptation blocks (lower row).\nIn these blocks, the head posture group exhibiting a lessening of performance disruptions\nupon switching between the two gains of display.\n7. Experiment Two post-test primary submovement distance (1.0 gain of display, plotted by\nlevel of cue). The upper row plots the first 16 trials and the lower row plots the second 16\n(following the change in cue level). There were large condition effect sizes, with the head\nposture cue effective for both the first and second post blocks and the target orientation cue\neffective for the second post test block only.\n\n23\n\nReferences\n[1] Berger M, Lechner-Steinleitner S, Kozlovskaya I, Holzmuller G, Mescheriakov S, Sokolov\nA, Gerstenbrand F (1998) The effect of head-to-trunk position on the direction of arm\nmovements before, during, and after spaceflight.
