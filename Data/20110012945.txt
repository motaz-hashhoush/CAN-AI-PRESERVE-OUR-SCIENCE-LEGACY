b'Once the bottom sampling was complete, the PAARV would increase its\nbuoyancy by displacing liquid from the\nbuoyancy-control chambers and would\nreel the tether back in. An onboard\nguidance, navigation, and control system coupled with acoustic range sensors\nwould enable the vehicle to move slowly\n\ntoward shore as it ascended. Upon contact with ascending slope, the crawler\ntracks would be rotated to the angle of\nthe slope and the crawler tracks would\nbe activated. Once out of the water, the\nPAARV would crawl to a location of interest designated by coordinates provided by cameras on the carrier vehicle\n\nor an aircraft overhead. The sampling\nprocess would be repeated at the location of interest.\nThis work was done by Charles Bergh and\nWayne Zimmerman of Caltech for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet\nPropulsion Laboratory.

The\nsystem, denoted a sample preparation, acquisition, handling, and delivery\n(SPAHD) device, would be mounted on a\nrobotic exploratory vehicle that would traverse the terrain of interest on the Earth\nor on a remote planet. The SPAHD device\nwould probe the ground to obtain data\nfor optimization of sampling, prepare the\nsurface, acquire samples in the form(s) of\ncores and/or powdered cuttings, and deliver the samples to a selected location for\nanalysis and/or storage.\nThe SPAHD device would be built\naround an ultrasonic/sonic drill corer\n(USDC) \xe2\x80\x94 an apparatus that was reported in \xe2\x80\x9cUltrasonic/Sonic Drill/ Corers With Integrated Sensors\xe2\x80\x9d (NPO20856), NASA Tech Briefs, Vol. 25, No. 1\n(January 2001), page 38. To recapitulate: A USDC includes a hollow drill bit\nor corer, in which combinations of ultrasonic and sonic vibrations are excited by\nan electronically driven piezoelectric actuator. The corer can be instrumented\nwith a variety of sensors (and/or the\ndrill bit or corer can be used as an\nacoustic-impedance sensor) for both\nprobing the drilled material and acquiring feedback for control of the excitation. The USDC advances into the material of interest by means of a\nhammering action and a resulting chiseling action at the tip of the corer. The\nhammering and chiseling actions are so\neffective that unlike in conventional\ntwist drilling, a negligible amount of\naxial force is needed to make the USDC\nadvance into the material. Also unlike a\nconventional twist drill, the USDC operates without need for torsional restraint,\nlubricant, or a sharp bit.\n\n20\n\nPlatform\n(Robotic Exploratory Vehicle)\n\nWedge\n\nElectrical and Mechanical\nInterfaces With the Subsystems\n\nCommunication\nSubsystem\n\nControl\nSubsystem\n\nPower\nSubsystem\n\nTube\n\nSpring\n\nSensor\nSubsystem\n\nPositioning Subsystem\n\nUSDC\n\nTooling for Interchange of Bits\n\nTool Bit\n\nFigure 2.
