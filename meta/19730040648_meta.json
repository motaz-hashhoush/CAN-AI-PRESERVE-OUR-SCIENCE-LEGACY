Phased project planning is a phased approach to the planning, approval, and conduct of major research and  development activity. A progressive build-up of knowledge of all aspects of the program is provided. Elements of logistics are discussed together with aspects of integrated logistics support, logistics program planning, and logistics activities for phased programs. Continuing logistics support can only be assured if there is a comprehensive sequential listing of all logistics activities tied to the program schedule and a real-time inventory of assets.", "title": "Logistics planning for phased programs.", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-07T03:54:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19730040648, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Cook, W.
