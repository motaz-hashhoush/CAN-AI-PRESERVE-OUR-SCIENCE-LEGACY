Traditionally, spacesuits are designed to operate both dependently and independently of a host vehicle\nenvironment control and life support system (ECLSS). Spacesuits that operate independent of vehicle-provided ECLSS\nservices must do so with equipment selfcontained within or on the spacesuit. Suits\nthat are dependent on vehicle-provided\nconsumables must remain physically connected to and integrated with the vehicle\nto operate properly.\nThis innovation is the design and prototype of a hybrid spacesuit approach that\nconfigures the spacesuit to seamlessly interface and integrate with either type of\nvehicular systems, while still maintaining\nthe ability to function completely independent of the vehicle. An existing Advanced Crew Escape Suit (ACES) was utilized as the platform from which to\ndevelop the innovation. The ACES was\nretrofitted with selected components and\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, December 2013\n\none-off items to achieve the objective.\nThe ventilation system concept was developed and prototyped/retrofitted to an\nexisting ACES. Components were selected\nto provide suit connectors, hoses/umbilicals, internal breathing system ducting/\nconduits, etc. The concept utilizes a lowpressure-drop, high-flow ventilation system\nthat serves as a conduit from the vehicle\nsupply into the suit, up through a neck\nseal, into the breathing helmet cavity, back\ndown through the neck seal, out of the\nsuit, and returned to the vehicle. The concept also utilizes a modified demand-based\nbreathing system configured to function\nseamlessly with the low-pressure-drop\nclosed-loop ventilation system.\nThis work was done by Brian A.

MSC-24804-1\n\nData Quality Screening\nService\nA report describes the Data Quality\nScreening Service (DQSS), which is designed to help automate the filtering of\nremote sensing data on behalf of science\nusers. Whereas this process often involves\nmuch research through quality documents followed by laborious coding, the\n\nDQSS is a Web Service that provides data\nusers with data pre-filtered to their particular criteria, while at the same time guiding the user with filtering recommendations of the cognizant data experts.\nThe DQSS design is based on a formal\nsemantic Web ontology that describes data\nfields and the quality fields for applying\nquality control within a data product. The\naccompanying code base handles several\nremote sensing datasets and quality control schemes for data products stored in\nHierarchical Data Format (HDF), a common format for NASA remote sensing\ndata. Together, the ontology and code support a variety of quality control schemes\nthrough the implementation of the\nBoolean expression with simple, reusable\nconditional expressions as operands.\nAdditional datasets are added to the\nDQSS simply by registering instances in\nthe ontology if they follow a quality\nscheme that is already modeled in the\nontology. New quality schemes are\nadded by extending the ontology and\nadding code for each new scheme.\nThis work was done by Richard Strub,\nChristopher Lynnes, Thomas Hearty, and\nYoung-In Won of Goddard Space Flight Center; and Peter Fox and Stephan Zednik of\nRensselaer Polytechnic Institute.
