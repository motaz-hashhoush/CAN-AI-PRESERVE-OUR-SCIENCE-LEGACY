As part of this assessment, NASA is evaluating the effectiveness of an ongoing program in remote sensing technology transfer conducted by 20 university contractors/grantees, each supported totally or partially by NASA funds. The University-Space Applications program has as its objective the demonstration of practical benefits from the use of remote sensing technology to a broad spectrum of new users, principally in state and local governments. To evaluate the University-Space Applications program, NASA has a near-term requirement for data on each university effort including total funding, funding sources, length of program, program description, and effectiveness measures.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19790005948, "id": "55536090f77144be8f6e40dca81b349d", "publicationDate": "1978-03-31T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19790005948.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19790005948/downloads/19790005948.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19790005948/downloads/19790005948.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19790005948/downloads/19790005948.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
