This is particularly a\nproblem in space where the handling of objects requires\nprecision and reliability. Manual removal, replacement 20\nand positioning of objects is somewhat tedious for various reasons including the zero gravity environment.\nPermanent hand holds have been installed on the units\nneeded replacing but this necessitates the consumption\nof weight which is desired to be minimized as well as 25\nspace.\nManual manipulation of replaceable units in orbit\nposes several problems. For one, some of the units have\nsharp comers which can cut or abrade an astronaut\xe2\x80\x99s\n0\ngloved hand. Similarly, since the astronaut\xe2\x80\x99s dexterity is 3\nseverely hampered by the pressurized suit, positioning\naccuracy and articulation capabilities suffer. The astronaut is in a compromising and uncomfortable position\nwith poor visibility and a poor feel for alignment of bolt\nholes, etc. This enhances the probability of damaged 35\nhardware. Since hand manipulation of replaceable units\nis more cumbersome, time consumption is greater, thus\nadding to the cost and risk associated with the mission.\nAs an alternate to hand removal, it has been proposed to\n0\noutfit the replaceable unit with permanent handles, 4\nbolted or riveted to the box exterior. Since the majority\nof the replaceable units are already built, a very large\ncost in time would be incurred.\nAccordingly, an object of the invention is to provide\na portable hand hold device which can be easily ad- 45\njusted in order to interface with various units and boxes\nfor clamping and handling.\nAnother object of the invention is to provide a portable hand hold device for interfacing various units and\nboxes for replacement in orbit which has a discreet 50\nadjustment for effective telescoping ability and positive\nclamping.\n\n2\n\nning rotational input required to effect clamping, the\ndevice lends itself easily to use with a torque wrench.\nThe clamps are carried on double telescoping rods\nwhich provides compactness and allows for a large\namount of extension capability per unextended length.\nThis feature allows for a quick acting, small, easily\nstowed device for clamping units in boxes. The combination of a circular ratchet gear/pawl arrangement as a\nlocking arrangement in a linear clamping device provide highly effective adjustment and clamping. The\ncircular ratchet gear allows for a simple, effective lock\nwith high resolution ability. For all practical purposes,\nthe device is infinitely adjustable while providing a\npositive lock which is a one shot operation and requires\nno \xe2\x80\x9ctweaking\xe2\x80\x9d adjustment such as locking pliers. A\nspring loaded cam and pawl actuation mechanism\nwherein a detented cam is used to provide spring load\nto a pawl provides a highly efficient ratchet pawl mechanism. The spring loading may occur regardless of the\ndirection in which the device is being ratcheted.\nDESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\nThe construction designed to carry out the invention\nwill hereinafter be described, together with other features thereof.\nThe invention will be more readily understood from\na reading of the following specification and by reference to the accompanying drawings forming a part\nthereof, wherein an example of the invention is shown\nand wherein:\nFIG. 1 is a front elevation with parts cut away illustrating a portable hand hold device for grasping and\nholding boxes and units for handling;\nFIG. 2 is a top plan view of the device of FIG. 1 with\nparts cut away;\nFIG. 3 is an enlarged view of a ratchet/pawl mechanism constructed in accordance with the present invention with the mechanism in a lock position;\nFIG. 4 is an enlarged view of a ratchet/pawl lock\nmechanism constructed in accordance with the present\ninvention in an unlock position; and\nFIG. 5 is an end view of the device of FIG. 2.\n\nDESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED\nEMBODIMENT\nReferring now in more detail to the drawings, a portable hand hold device, designated generally as A, is\nillustrated, having a housing 10 and a housing cover 12.\nHousing 10, housing cover 12, and a hand hold 14 are\nattached together using conventional screw fasteners 16\nto form a main body designated generally as 18 to encase the internal mechanism. Internal drive means B\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\nincludes a pinion shaft 20 having a spur gear 22 affxed\nThe above objectives are accomplished according to 55 thereon. Pinion shaft 20 may be trunnioned between\nball bearings located in the housing and the housing\nthe present invention by providing a hand held device\ncover. Spur gear 22 engages two parallel rack gears 24,\nhaving a pair of linear movement clamps which are\n26 carried on rods 24a, 26u respectively. Rack gears 24,\nlocked by a fine tooth ratchet pawl locking mechanism.\n26 may be fastened to the rack carrier rods 24u, 26u in\nRubber grip pads on the clamps provide a built in compliance which provides virtually infinite resolution ca- 60 any suitable manner such as by using ordinary machine\nscrews. Spur gear 22 is rotated through a lever 23\npabilities without the need for trial and error mechaniwhich drives rack rods 24a, 2 6 ~To prevent over exten.\ncal adjustments such as found on locking pliers. Desion, a carrier stop 28 is fastened to the end of each rack\npending on the quantity of ratchet teeth, spur gear size,\ncarrier rod. The rack gears and rack carrier rods peneand whether or not the pawl is compounded, linear\nresolutions as small as 0.001 inches can be achieved. The 65 trate housing 10 through rack bushings 30. Carried on\nthe ends of the rack carrier rods are clamp means in the\ndevice lends itself to use with a torque wrench in those\nform of clamp brackets 32, 34 and pad plates 324 341\ninstances when the linear clamping load is critical and\nhaving rubber grip pads 32b, 34b. The rubber grip pads\nwould cause damage to hardware. Due to the free run-\n\n3\n\n4.968.077\n\nmay be attached to the pad plates by any suitable manner such as using rivets. The grip pads serve to prevent\nabrasive damage to the hardware, and provide a positive grip by adding compliance and friction to the system.\nLock means for locking the clamps of the hand hold\ndevice is illustrated generally at C. Lock means provides a positive clamping force to lock a captured unit\nof box to the device for replacement. As illustrated,\nlock means C includes a ratchet gear 40 which is\nmounted co-axially with spur gear 22 on pinion shaft 20.\nTeeth 40u of ratchet gear 40 are formed in a sixty degree saw tooth configuration so as to capture a mating\npawl 42. The pads provide a built in compliance for the\nfine-tooth ratchet/pawl mechanism resulting in virtually infinite resolution without trial and error type adjustments. Pawl 42 is affixed to a pawl shaft 4 which is\n4\njournaled by means of ball bearings in housing 10. Pawl\n42 is spring loaded by means of biasing means in the\nform of a pair of cantilevered springs 46,48, and a cam\n50 positioned between the cantilever springs. Cam 50 is\ncarried on a shaft 52 having a handle means 54 affuted to\nan end which extends through housing 10. Handle\nmeans 54 provides a pawl engaging lever. The pawl\nengaged cam 50 may be held in the lock/unlock position by a ball detent threaded through a detent holder\nfastened to housing cover 12 or by any suitable means\nsuch as machine screws. Stops precisely constrain cam\nmovement to the 90" detent positions.\nIn operation, to engage the lock means C comprising\nthe ratchet/pawl mechanism, pawl engage handle 54 is\nturned to the lock position, as can best be seen in FIG.\n3. This rotates cam 50 and spring loads tooth 4% of\npawl 42 into engagement with ratchet gear 40. When\nlever 23 is turned so as to retract or close clamps 32,34,\nratchet gear 40 advances with respect to pawl 42. This\ncauses pawl 42 to arc in and out of engagement with\nratchet gear teeth 40a As rack gears 24, 26 are driven\nback, cantilever spring 46,48 causes the pawl to seek\nstability mating with a specific gear tooth. The locking\nis further augmented by the geometric relationship of\nthe pawl, pawl shaft, and the point of tangency the pawl\ntooth shares with the ratchet gear 40. That is, as the\nclamping load increases, the pawl is load driven into\nfurther engagement. To disengage lock means C and\nthe ratchet mechanism, pawl engagement lever 54 is\nturned to the unlock position, as can best be seen in\nFIG. 4. This action rotates cam 50 and spring loads\npawl 42 as to disengage it. Lever handle 23 is then\nturned slightly so as to retract grip pads 326, 34b. The\ngrip pads compress slightly and allow ratchet gear 40 to\nadvance. This unloads pawl 42 and allows cantilever\nsprings 46,48to rotate pawl 42 out of engagement with\nratchet teeth 40u.\nThus, it can be seen that a highly advantageous construction can be had for a hand hold device for gripping\nand clamping boxes and units for replacement in orbital\nmaneuvers in space and the like. Precise adjustment and\npositive clamping are provided in a very simplistic\nform. Other embodiments may exist, for example, by\nchanging the configuration of the grip surfaces, this\ndevice could be used to provide a portable hand hold\nfor spherical vessels, tubular framework, trusses, etc.\nSwiveling or self-centering grip surfaces may also enhance capability. By adding a cable member or web\nlength, the device could be used as a tension or load\nbinder. This type of device could be used in a variety of\napplications such as the on-orbit storage and transporta-\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\n55\n\n60\n\n65\n\n4\n\ntion of material such as tubing structures, panels, etc.\nUnlike the ratcheting cable devices and web type load\nbinders currently in use, all of the mechanism is enclosed which enhances safety. Devices similar in nature\ncan be used for on-orbit clamping or assembling where\nthe proper amount of clamp load or pre-load is critical\nto the assembly. To accomplish this, a torque wrench,\nclutch, or similar load indicating mechanism could be\nused in lieu of the handle. Because of the proportionality between torque and clamp load, an accurate linear\nload value can be obtained by coupling this device with\nan input torque indicator such as torque wrench.\nWhile a preferred embodiment of the invention has\nbeen described using specific terms, such description is\nfor illustrative purposes only, and it is to be understood\nthat changes and variations may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the following claims.\nWhat is claimed is:\n1.
