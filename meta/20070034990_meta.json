SPIRIT will accomplish these objectives through infrared observations with a two aperture interferometric instrument. This paper gives an overview of SPIRIT design and operation, and how the three design cycle concept study was completed. The error budget for several key performance values allocates tolerances to all contributing factors, and a performance model of the spacecraft plus instrument system demonstrates meeting those allocations with margin.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20070034990, "endDate": "2007-08-27T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "International Society for Optical Engineering", "location": "United States"}}, "meetingId": "e1b1c037726e4149a6ee35c281c92c9c", "id": "f123809095dc4e7990e4d668646a5aa3"}], "name": "SPIE International Symposium on Optics and Photonics.
