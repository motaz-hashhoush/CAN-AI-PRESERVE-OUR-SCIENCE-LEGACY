b'NASA Technology Demonstrations Missions Program\nOverview\nSusan Turner, Assistant to the Engineering Director\nEngineering Directorate\nNASA Marshall Space Flight Center, AL 35812\n\nAbstract\nThe National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Fiscal Year 2010 (FY10) budget introduced a new\nstrategic plan that placed renewed emphasis on advanced missions beyond Earth orbit. This supports NASA\xe2\x80\x99s 2011\nstrategic goal to create innovative new space technologies for our exploration, science, and economic future. As a\nresult of this focus on undertaking many and more complex missions, NASA placed its attention on a greater\ninvestment in technology development, and this shift resulted in the establishment of the Technology\nDemonstrations Missions (TDM) Program. The TDM Program, within the newly formed NASA Office of the Chief\nTechnologist, supports NASA\xe2\x80\x99s grand challenges by providing a steady cadence of advanced space technology\ndemonstrations (Figure 1), allowing the infusion of flexible path capabilities for future exploration. The TDM\nProgram\xe2\x80\x99s goal is to mature crosscutting capabilities to flight readiness in support of multiple future space missions,\nincluding flight test projects where demonstration is needed before the capability can transition to direct mission\napplication.\n\nFigure 1. Lander concept.\nThe TDM Program has several unique criteria that set it apart from other NASA program offices. For instance, the\nTDM Office matures a small number of technologies that are of benefit to multiple customers to flight technology\nreadiness level (TRL) 6 through relevant environment testing on a 3-year development schedule. These technologies\nmust be crosscutting, which is defined as technology with potential to benefit multiple mission directorates, other\ngovernment agencies, or the aerospace industry, and they must capture significant public interest and awareness.\nThese projects will rely heavily on industry partner collaboration, and funding is capped for all elements of the flight\ntest demonstration including planning, hardware development, software development, launch costs, ground\noperations, and post-test assessments. In order to inspire collaboration across government and industry, more than\n70% of the TDM funds will be competitively awarded as a result of yearly calls for proposed flight demonstrators\nand selected based on possible payoff to NASA, technology maturity, customer interest, cost, and technical risk\nreduction. This paper will give an overview of the TDM Program\xe2\x80\x99s mission and organization, as well as its current\nstatus in delivering advanced space technologies that will enable more flexible and robust future missions. It also\nwill provide several examples of missions that fit within these parameters and expected outcomes.\n1\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\n'
