b'SPECIAL OBSERVATIONS\nDonald Beran\nNOAA Wave Propagation Laboratory\nThe profiler is one of the new special observation devices. Figure 1 shows\nthe impact of various meteorological data types on "forecast lead time." A scale\ncalled "relative importance" is used to avoid advocating a particular sensor. Clearly,\nradar is most useful in the short, nowcast (out-to-one-hour) time frame. Satellites\nand surface observations are also most useful for short-range forecasts but have less\nimpact on the longer range. The radiosonde network, on the other hand, only starts\nto be very important after about 6 hours and has greatest impact a t lead times of\n12 hours or more. It has even been suggested that forecasts of greater than 12 hours\nmay be better than present short-range forecasts.\nMany people speak of a data "gapn. A data "valley" is seen in Figure 1, but\nis not a real gap. So why are we concerned? What do we need to do differently?\nI submit that we have been viewing this diagram incorrectly, and that, in fact, it\nis a three-dimensional diagram (Figure 2 ) . Observations are of two fundamental\ntypes: 1) those which show atmospheric discontinuities, and 2) those which show\nbasic fields in the atmosphere. It is the atmospheric discontinuities which are most\nimportant to one-hour forecasts. For example, radar detects an atmospheric discontinuity (e.g., a thunderstorm), whose position can be extrapolated for a short\ndistance. The second type, the actual measurement of a basic field of wind, temperature, or humidity, is needed to do true forecasting for more than one hour.\nWe are attempting to correct these weaknesses with VAS and Doppler radar,\nbut I submit that we still have a gap. I further suggest to you in the aviation community that this is a very important area for aviation forecasting. The importance\nof the two-to-eight-hour forecasts becomes evident when we try to define the critical\nweather that may be encountered during, for example, a flight from New York to\nLos Angeles.\nRadiosonde vs. Profiler\nOf course, radiosondes could be p laced at much greater density all over the\nUnited States, and the frequency of the soundings could be increased to every couple\nof hours. This would, however, be extremely difficult to accomplish because of some\nof the characteristics of a radiosonde (Figure 3). First, it is difficult t o obtain good\ntemporal resolution. The temporal resolution of a radiosonde is only as fast as a\nman can blow up and release a balloon. Even this rate is limited because a second\nballoon cannot be launched until the first has burst and allowed the transmitter\nto fall to the ground. Temporal resolution is, therefore, limited regardless of how\n\nIMPACT OF METEOROLOGICAL DATA TYPES\n\na\n\nSURFACE OBSERVATIONS\nI\n\n1 hr\n\n6 hr\nFORECAST LEAD TIME\n\n12 hr\n\nFigure 1.

Second, it is nearly impossible to automate a\nballoon system. Therefore, it would seem preferable to find another solution. We\nbelieve it is the profiler.\nThe wind is measured by using clear-air Doppler radar principles. Two fixed\nbeams, pointing 15 degrees to the north and 15 degrees to the east, sense the\nDoppler shift. The resulting wind vectors are then rotated to the horizontal and\ncombined to give total wind. Figure 4 is a schematic of a 50 MHz wind profiler\nshowing three beam positions (one vertical). The antenna for this system takes up\nan area of about 50 m on a side. Figure 5 is a photo of another version of the wind\nprofiler (the 915 MHz system located near Denver, Colorado). Work is currently\nunder way on a 405 MHz system which has a much smaller antenna. This smaller\nversion could well be the forerunner of commercial systems.\nComparisons of the winds measured by a profiler with those from a radiosonde\nhave been made many times over the past few years. We generally find that the\nprofiler is better than the radiosonde. Figures 6 and 7 illustrate the wind measurement capabilities of the profiler. Figure 6 shows winds measured a t NOAA\'s\nPlatteville, Colorado, site early in 1985 when a winter storm was moving through\nColorado. .A range of 16 km is shown. Figure 6 shows the wind field that would\nhave been measured by 12-hour radiosonde ascents. Figure 7 is the same wind field\nas measured by the profiler. The profiler is a very high temporal resolution system which operates automatically. You do not need to send up a balloon. During\nany 12-hour period the profiler can show mesoscale features that simply cannot be\nseen by using radiosondes. In Figure 7, for example, the profiler winds indicate a\nmesoscale low-pressure center that would have been missed by 12-hour radiosondes.\nThe radiosonde measures temperature and humidity as well as wind. Here\nthe story of the profiler is not quite so bright. A profiler measures temperature and humidity by using passive radiometers. Figure 8 is a time/height plot\nof radiometer-derived and radiosonde-measured temperature profiles near Denver,\nColorado. The dashed lines are from radiosonde-measured temperatures 12 hours\napart. The smooth curves are the radiometer temperatures. Notice that the radiometer does not see sharp "kinks" in the temperature profile. However, it does\nshow when the ground-based inversion broke up. Some meteorologists suggest that\nthis smooth profile is adequate. Others point out that the ground-based and upperlevel inversions are very important in predicting the onset of mesoscale convection.\nThe Wave Propagation Laboratory is doing research on adding the kinks to the\nradiometric temperature profiles. On the positive side, the radiometric system is\ncapable of very accurately measuring the height of pressure surfaces, one of the\nprimary inputs to numerical weather prediction models.\n\nDoppler-Radar\nWind Profiler\n(Platteville, Co.)\n\nF i g u r e 4.\n\nA schematic showing t h e 50 MHz antenna and f i x e d beam\np a t t e r n .

It is ready for implementation, and we are starting a program where that will occur. Temperature profiler\ndevelopment is probably only 75% complete. The remaining work is pictorially represented in Figure 9. The dashed lines suggest the sharp inversions that might be\nseen in a radiosonde trace. The solid lines represent the temperature profiles from\na radiometer at various points in our projected research plan. First, we know that\nby simply combining data from ground-based and satellite radiometers, the height\nof the profile can be extended. This is an improvement over both the ground-based\nand the satellite temperature profiles. Second, the wind profiler can detect the\nheight of inversion layers because the radar receives stronger signals from regions\nwhere temperature inversions are present. This information can then be added to\nthe profile. Finally, we have shown through computer simulation that the relationship between the temperature and wind field can be used to improve the derived\ntemperature profiles. The high-resolution winds from a network of profilers can\nbe used t o reproduce the temperature field and, in turn? to add the kinks in the\nradiometric temperature profile.\nWind profilers are to be installed in the central U. S. Figure 10 shows one\nof the proposed configurations for this network. The network will contain 30 to\n35 profilers some operating at 405 MHz, others at 50 MHz. This network will be\nused to test the operational characteristics of the profiler system and to assess the\noptimum frequency and distribution of profilers in a network.\nWe are also looking a t ways profilers might be used to support such operations\nas the Space Shuttle launch (Figure 11). This is a rather interesting special problem\n\nbecause, a t present, the best wind profile available for launch support is taken three\nand one-half hours before the launch. With a profiler, winds could be measured\nright up to the time of launch. The Shuttle recovery problem is equally interesting.\nIt is difficult to provide a four-hour forecast of whether there will be a thunderstorm\nover the end of the runway. Accurate high-resolution upper-air and surface measurements on and around the Florida peninsula would make the recovery forecast\nmuch easier.\nSummary\nIf we are to improve our ability t o forecast weather, we must have better highresolution data sets. We must also recognize that these high-resolution observations are needed for research in order to develop understanding and forecasting\ntechniques. The critical role of high-resolution measurements and their link t o automation, training, and improved mesoscale services is depicted in Figure 12. There\nis one link on this diagram that we seem to overlook. We do wonderful research experiments that employ high-resolution instrumentation. We operate for two months,\nthen remove the instruments and go away to develop new forecast techniques that\n\nTHERMODYNAMIC PROFILER\nRESEARCH PLAN\n\n(\\POPAUSE\n\n/\n\n\\\n\n\\\n\n\\\n\\\n\n+\n\nGROUND BASED\nRADIOMETRIC\n\nFigure 9.\n\nSATELLITE\nRADIOMETRIC\n\n+\n\nECHO\nINTENSITY\n\nf\n\nWIND\nGRADIENTS\n\nSchematic representation of the research s t e p s required t o\nimprove the height resolution of t h e thermodynamic p r o f i l e r .\nSee t e x t f o r f u l l e r explanation.\n\nA Proposed 1989 Wind Profiler Network\n\nFigure 10.\n\nOne of the proposed p r o f i l e r network configurations.\n\nProfiler Support Network for Space\nShuttle Recovery\n\nW.
