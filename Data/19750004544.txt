The arm\njoint includes a worm, which is coupled to an electric\nmotor for rotating a worm gear carried within a rotatable housing. The worm gear is supported on a thrust\nbearing and the rotatable housing is supported on a\nradial thrust bearing. A bolt extends through the housing, bearings, and worm gear for securing the device\ntogether. A potentiometer extends through the bolt,\nand is coupled to the rotatable housing for rotating\ntherewith, so as to produce an electrical signal indicating the angular position of the rotatable housing.\n6 Claims, 4 Drawing Figures\n\nPATENTLY 191974\n\n3,849,668\nSHEET 1 OF 2\n\nIZ\n\n36\nCOMPARISON\nCIRCUIT\n\nPATEN I L:^V 191974\n\n3,849,668\nSHEET 2 OF 2\n\n94\n95\n\n98\n\n40\n\n42\n100\n\ne&\n\n-\n\n3,849,668\n\n1\n\n2\n\nORTHOTIC ARM JOINT\n\nStill another important object of the present inven-\n\nORIGIN OF THE INVENTION\n*"1 **" ***\nThe invention described herein was made by an emStill another important object of the present invenployee of the United States Government, and may be 5 tion is to provide a relatively simple and maintenance\nmanufactured and used by or for the Government for\nfree joint that can be manipulated by use of electrical\ngovernmental purposes without the payment of any\nsignals.\nroyalties thereon or therefor.\nThese and other object and advantages of the invention wi become\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n"\napparent upon reference drawings.\nBACKUKUUNU Uh 1 Hb IN VhN I ION\n,\xe2\x80\x9e ,owjng specification attendant claims and to the folThis invention relates to an orthotic arm joint, and\nBRIEF\nmore particularly to an arm joint which can be accuDESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\nrately rotated for manipulating various objects.\nFIG. 1 is a schematic block diagram of an arm joint\nJoints have been utilized in mechanical arms for proconstructed in accordance with the present invention\nviding movement of the arm responsive to electrical \' 5 located within a circuit that can be used in remote consignals.

The gear\n18, which is carried on the end of the shaft 20, meshes\nwith gear 16 carried on the end of the shaft 14 so that\nthe D.C. motor 12 can rotate the worm 22. Suitable 5\nbearings 44 and 46 are provided for rotatably supporting the shaft 20 within the bore 42.\nThe housing 40 has an enlarged recess 48 provided\ntherein. The recess 48 terminates in a rear wall 50. A\ngroove is provided in the rear wall 50 for receiving an 10\ninner race 52 of a thrust ball bearing 54. An outer race\n56 of the thrust bearing 54 is suitably carried within the\ncircular groove provided in the face of the worm gear\n24. Positioned on the other side of the worm gear 24,\nand attached thereto by screws 58, is a spacer 60. The 15\nspacer 60 is, in turn, secured to the cylindrically shaped\nrotatable housing 26 by means of screws 62. Flush\nagainst an outer edge of the spacer 60 is a radial thrust\nbearing 64 which has an outer race ,66 engaging an\n.inner wall of the rotatable housing. An inner race 67 is 20\nsupported on a shank portion 68 of an elongated bolt\n70. The bolt 70 has an enlarged head 72 which abuts\nagainst the radial thrust bearing 64 with the shank portion 68 extending therefrom through the radial thrust\nbearing 64, the spacer 60, the worm gear 24, and a bore 25\n74 provided in the wall 50 of the fixed housing 40. The\nbore 74 has threads therein for engaging threads carried on the outer end of the shank portion of the bolt\n70. A lock-nut 76 is threaded on the end of the bolt 70\n30\nfor fixing the bolt to the housing 40.\nAn elongated bore 78 extends longitudinally through\nthe bolt 70 for receiving a shank portion 80 of the potentiometer 30.\nA cap 82 is secured to the outer end of the cylindrical\nrotatable housing 26 by means of screws 84. A groove 3S\n86 is provided in the inner surface of the cap 82 for receiving an elongated ridge 88 carried on an enlarged\nhead of the potentiometer 30 so as to permit the head\nof the potentiometer 30 to be rotated with the rotatable\nhousing 26. Wires 32 coming from the enlarged head 40\nof the potentiometer 30 extend through an opening in\nthe rotatable housing 26 so that such can be attached\nto a suitable voltage source and output device. When\nthe enlarged head of the potentiometer is rotated relative to the shank portion 80 thereof, such varies the 45\noutput signal of the potentiometer. The setting of the\npotentiometer may be adjusted by rotating an external\narm 93, which is connected by a setscrew 92, to the\nshank portion 80 of the potentiometer. The arm 93 has\nan arcuate slot 94 therein, of approximately 90 angular\ndegrees through which a bolt 95 extends. The inner end\nof the bolt 95 threadably engages the fixed housing 40.\nBy unscrewing the bolt and rotating the arm 93 a predetermined number of degrees the potentiometer 30 \xe2\x80\x9e\ncan be adjusted.\nThe rotatable housing 26 has grooves 96 provided\ntherein for receiving an inner end of nylon setscrews\n98. The nylon setscrews 98 are threaded through holes\nprovided in a collar 100 which extends around the ro- 6Q\ntatable housing.\nThe reason that nylon setscrews are utilized for securing the collar 100 to the rotatable housing 26 is to\nprevent damaging the joint if too great a load is applied\nto the outwardly extending arm 28 carried by the collar 65\n100. When the load exceeds a predetermined force the\nnylon screws permit the collar 100 to slip on the rotatable housing 26.\'\n\nIt is noted that the inner race 67 of the radial thrust\nbearing 64 is supported on the shank portion 68 of the\nbolt 70 so as to permit the rotatable housing 26 to rotate freely relative to the bolt.\nIn summarizing the operation of the joint, when an\nelectrical signal is applied to the D.C. motor 12 such\ncauses the shaft 14 to rotate a predetermined number\nof degrees. The rotation of the shaft 14, in turn, causes\nthe worm 22 to be rotated. The rotation of the worm\n22 causes the worm gear 24 to be rotated. When the\nworm gear 24 is rotated the housing 26 is rotated therewith. The arm 28 carried by the collar 100, which is attached to the housing 26, is also rotated a predetermined number of degrees. Thus, it can be seen that by\nselectively energizing the electric motor 12 the arm 28\ncan be manipulated. It is noted that when the housing\n26 is rotated the enlarged head portion of the potentiometer is rotated therewith relative to the shank portion 80. This causes an electrical signal to be fed out\nover the wires 32 indicating the angular position of the\narm 28. Therefore, by comparing the electrical signal\nproduced by the potentiometer 30 with signals produced by a potentiometer carried in a master arm corrective signals can be applied to the motor 12 so that\nthe arm 28 is in the same position as the arm carried by\na master unit.\nBy utilizing a radial thrust bearing 64 spaced from a\nthrust bearing 54, as shown in FIG. 3, the arm joint is\nmore \'capable of handling bending forces applied\nthereto. When the joint is used in an orthopedic arm it\nis not necessary to utilize the potentiometer 30, since\nthe position of the devices attached to the arm 28 can\nbe physically observed, rather than relying on an electrical signal for indicating the angular position thereof.\nWhile a preferred embodiment of the invention has\nbeen described using specific terms, such description is\nfor illustrative purposes only, and it is to be understood\nthat changes and variations may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the following claims.\nWhat is claimed is:\n1.
