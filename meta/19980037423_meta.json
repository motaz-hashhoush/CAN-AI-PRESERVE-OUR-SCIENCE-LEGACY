The audio frequency range signal can be used to drive a pair of headphones worn by an operator. A diode rectifier based mixing circuit provides a simple, inexpensive way to mix the transducer signal with a square wave signal generated by an oscillator, and thereby generate the audio frequency signal. The sensitivity of the system is greatly increased through proper selection and matching of the system components. and the use of noise rejection filters and elements. In addition, a parabolic collecting horn is preferably employed which is mounted on the transducer assembly housing. The collecting horn increases sensitivity of the system by amplifying the received signals. and provides directionality which facilitates easier location of an ultrasonic vibration source.", "title": "Ultrasonic Leak Detection System", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-18T00:37:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19980037423, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Youngquist, Robert C."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Kennedy Space Center", "location": "Cocoa Beach, FL United States"}}, "id": "69b5e3b3301d468183361870f2a76978"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19980037423, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Moerk, J.
