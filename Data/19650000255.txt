The regulator must be capable of fast response\nto changes in both load and supply.\nThe solution: A regulator that alternately connects\nan inductor in parallel and in series with the input\nvoltage source. When connected in parallel energy\nflowing into the inductor is stored in its magnetic core\nand, when connected in series, the stored energy is\nreleased to the output load at an increased voltage.\nHow it\'s done: The regulator consists of the flyback inductor, the switch that connects the inductor\neither in series or parallel with the input, and the associated circuitry that controls the switch.\nThe clock pulse generator provides the reference signal for the regulator. It produces a constant-frequency\nsquare wave at a frequency which is proportional to\nthe regulator supply voltage. Thus, frequency regulation is achieved through supply voltage regulation.\nThe clock pulse generator produces a positive-going\nsquare wave at a time when the inductor is in parallel\n\nPulse\nGenerator\t\n\n\t\n\nBridge\nCircuit\n\nwith the unboosted voltage input. The square wave\nis differentiated and the positive spike fires the blocking oscillator. This activates and controls the reset,\nand also turns on the hold off. The reset sends a signal\nto the switch which places the inductor in series with\nthe input. It also sends a signal to the pulse generator\nto inhibit it. When the inductor is placed in series with\nthe input, a signal to the blocking oscillator turns it off\nwhich turns off the reset. At this time the switch attempts to place the inductor back in parallel, but this\nis prevented by the hold off. When the reset was\nturned off, a capacitor in the pulse generator began to\ncharge, via the bridge circuit, at a rate inversely proportional to the output voltage. When the capacitor\ncharges to a predetermined value, the pulse generator\nfires the hold off, removing the hold from the switch\nand placing the inductor back in parallel with the\ninput. The regulator is now back in its original condition and the process is repeated.\nNotes:\nI. This innovation sould be of general interest in the\ndesign of voltage regulators.\n(continued overleaf)\n\nAn\n\nMr\n\nThis document was prepared under the sponsorship of the National\nAeronautics and Space Administration.
