We compiled a listing of all changes processed through\nthe various configuration control boards (CCBs) subsequent to the SL-1 \t\nl\n\nPhase 1I FRR. This listing was utilized by the FRR team in evaluating \t\na\xc2\xb0\n\nthe payload readiness for flight. We processed 14 engineering change\nrequests (ECRs) through the MSFC Level II CCB. Most of these changes\napplied to requests for approval of late stowage items and included\n\t\n\na\n\napproval of Revision E to the SL-1 stowage list. We processed a change\napproving the SL-1 payload deintegration requirements which were incorporated into the SL-1 GIRD. We processed six field engineering changes\n(FECs) which were implemented onsite at KSC.\nWe participated in the Joint Integrated Simulations at the JSC\nPOCC. This participation included the monitoring of the POCC terminal\nin the Customer Services Room, the maintenance of an activities log, and\nthe maintenance of SPAN-CSR action requests. We forwarded these action\nrequests to the specified actionees.\nWBS 75.13 - Inte g rated Pa.vload ComDatibilit\nThe Mission Manager\'s payload integration support group at KSC\ncontinued to support the payload activities. Primary tasks were \t\n\nr\n\nreplacement of expendable SL-1 flight item;, impacted by the launch\ndelay, and review and updating of the SL-1 deintegration requirements \t\nfi\n\n4-1\n\nbased on updated guidelines, We arc also supporting the simulation\nactivities at the POCC and the HOSC in preparation for the November 28,\n1983, launch.\nWBS 95.0 - PAYLOAD FLIGHT OPERATIONS INTEGRATION\nWBS 95.1 - Onboard Fli ght/Mission Operations\nLaunch date changes from September to October and finally to\nNovember caused portions of the Payload Flight Data File (PFDF) to be\nrevised and put through the printing and fabrication process again.\nThese revisions required additional short-term effort, which we provided\nto meet the delivery requirements.\nWe continued to support the Integrated Training/Proficiency\nTraining (IT/PT) that was rescheduled and conducted in October and\nNovember 1983.\nWBS 95.2\t\n\nPOCC Requirements\n\nFour of the five remaining POCC cadre training simulations were\nconducted at JSC and supported from the Huntsville Operations Support\nCenter (,?i .\' and the Payload Crew Training Complex (PCTC). Joint Integrated 1 mulation (JIS) -04 was a 72-hour mission simulation, which\nstarted on Monday, September 19, 1983. For the first time, virtually\nall of the elements that will function during the mission participated\nin the simulation. We prepared the MSFC simulation script and assisted\nin the coordination of that script with the JSC simulation team. We\nalso participated in the debriefing of the simulation held on September\n23, 1983, at which we presented the payload malfunctions that had been\nincluded in the script for that simulation.\nWe participated in the conduct of 8-hour simulations on\nSeptember 28, 1983, and October 6, 1983. These were on-orbit simula-\n\n0\n\ntions for which we coordinated the payload inputs to the simulation\nscript with JSC and participated in both the sim prebriefing and debrifing.\nA 57-hour simulation, JIS-07, was conducted October 11-13, 1983.\nAgain, we prepared and coordinated the payload portion of the script and\n4\n\n9\t\n\n4-2\t\n\n;\n\nI\n\ni\n\nparticipated in the conduct of the simulation and the simulation\nprebriefing and debriefing.\nPOCC Operations Training Documents (DR FI-05) were prepared and\n\n^.\n\ndelivered for Joint Integrated Simulations 02, 03, and 08.\n3\n\nThe HOSC HRM Data Base was finalized and delivered on October\n26,\t 1983,\nWBS 95.3 - Payload Data Processing Requirements\n\nf\n\nWe incorporated changes resulting from a meeting with the\niv\n\nPrincipal Investigators in preparation for republishing the Spacelab\nData Processing Facility Requirements Document; Part I, and the Video\n\nw*\nRequirements Document.\nWe assisted Boeing in checking out modifications to the\n\nAutomated Data Requirements System (ADRS).\nWBS 95.4 - Public Affairs Inflight Video a nd Photographic Requirements\n\nWe participated in the: four Joint Integrated Simulations\nconducted at JSC during the reporting period by manning the TV Ups\nposition in the POCC.\nt.\n\nThe contents of the TV/Photo Ops Book were continually changing\n\nJill\n\nthroughout the reporting period.\t\n\nRevision A to the final document was\n\ndelivered on September 30, 1983.\t\n\nChanges to this issue were in progress\n\nat the close of the reporting period.\nThe last payload crew training on TV operations was conducted in\nthe PCTC using flight type TV cameras and associated equipment.\n\n4-3\n\nK\n\n4\n\n5. SPACELAB MISSION NO. 2\n\nWBS 35.0 - SUPPORT SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT\nWBS 35.1 - Mission Peculiar Equipment (MPE)\nMiscellaneous Parts/Materials\nThe following parts/materials were delivered during this report\nperiod:\n\xc2\xae\t\n\nTwenty-five electrical cables to KSC\n\no\t\n\nCable markers and lacing tape to KSC\n\n0\t\n\nTwo RAU mounting brackets to MSFC/MDTSCO\n\n\xc2\xae\t\n\nMLI material to the University of Iowa\n\n\xc2\xa9\t\n\nTwo connectors to the Naval Research Laboratory.\n\nMLI\n`^31\n\nThe following MLI blankets are in work at Sheldahl:\n\n0\t\n\nExperiment 6\n\n0\t\n\nColdplates 1 and 12\n\n\xc2\xae\t\n\nExperiment 10 electronics.\n\nOur manufacturing division has been authorized to fabricate the\ncoldplate MLI tent frames. The 2219 aluminum tubing specified on the\ndrawings could not be obtained in time to meet any reasonable delivery\nschedule; therefore, 6061 aluminum tubing was ordered for this job and\nis Lxpected not later than November 21, 1983. The work will then proceed and delivery should be complete not later than December 23, 1983.\nCables\nOf the 54 MPE cables in work, 23 are at KSC, 12 are at MSFC for\nbaking, 9 are in fabrication, and 10 are on hold for various reasons,\ni.e., awaiting; connectors baking; 2 EOS from MSFC; and GFE connectors\nfrom MDTSCO. Fabrication of the three VFI cruciform cables will begin\nupon receipt of tie wraps and wire.\nPCA\nThe PCA modifications are ii, work and will be complete not later\nthan December 9, 1983.\n\n5-1\n\nY\n\nU\n+\'\n\nWBS 75.0 - PAYLOAD INTEGRATION REQUIREMENTS\nWBS 75.2 - MPE Final Desia\nMeetings were held with the Experiment 10/11 instrument\ndeveloper to review new insulation requirements for the HRTS telescope\nand the status of the design for the additional radiator area on the\nSUSIM instrument. An additional meeting was held at NRL to examine the\nhardware and trial fit the insulation designs to the flight hardware.\nThe results of this meeting require some redesign of the HRTS aperture\ndoor blankets and a new start on the SUSIM designs. These changes will\nnecessitate an approximate 3 to 6 weeks slip in design baseline and\nrelease for fabrication.\nThe PCA design documentation was updated during this period to\nincorporate the new ESA/DS clamp unit actuation system design and add\ninterface provisions to the PCA assembly fixture for the new ESA/DSprovided X-struts: This PCA assembly documentation and associated Part\nI and II CEI specifications, materials lists, and associated analyses\nwill be submitted for MSFC Level II baseline on or before November 21,\n1983.\nWBS 75.9 - Ground Operations Analysis and Requirements Definition\n\nq\nm\n\nFor SL-2, we are preparing the initial release of the deintegration requirements for early review submittal on December 14, 1983. GIRD\nmaintenance for SL-2 is continuing.\nWBS 75.10 - Safety and Quality Assurance\nTrips were made to experiment developer facilities on Experiments 3, 7, and 9 to acquire data for the ground and flight safety data\npackages. The GSE/ECE Ground Operations Data Package was updated to\nPhase III status and submitted for MSFC review. There are still many\nopen items which will be closed after receipt of GFE data.

The aluminum plate\nfor the cruciform blades arrived and our manufacturing division was\nauthorized to machine these blades to the required external envelopes.\nThis machining will be completed in time to start detailed machining\nwhen the detail drawings are complete.\nThe fabrication of the epoxy test fixture started. It will not\nbe complete on November 16, 1983, as requested. We are attempting to\ncomplete \'the fixture on or before December 9, 1983. The Invar plate for\nthe Optical Sensor Package (OSP) platform was ordered and delivery is\nexpected not later than January 6, 1984. Two pieces of titanium were\ndelivered to the University of Wisconsin on September 21, 1983.\nWBS 75.0 - PAYLOAD INTEGRATION REQUIREMENTS\niz\n\nWBS 75.2 - MPE Design\nDuring this reporting period, detail design work in all areas of\nthe Astro-1 project proceeded rapidly. By the end of the period, 118\ndrawings had been delivered to checking and 25 drawings have either been\nbaselined or are in the process of being baselined. Critical drawings\nwhich were baselined are the cruciform envelope drawings.\nAstro design personnel supported an Astro Clamp Status Review\nwhich was held at Rockwell, Downey.\nAll design-related DNs which were scheduled to be closed during\nthis period were closed out.\nThermal analyses of the cruciform, Integrated Radiator System\n\nd^\n\n(IRS), and PCA continued during the period. The cruciform thermal model\nis being updated to reflect post-PDR design changes. The sensitivity\n\nf^\n\nstudy was completed and the results were presented to MSFC. A tentative\ni\n\n8-1\n\n}\n4\n\ndecision was made to place heat pipes on the cruciform. The final\ndecision was delayed pending the completion of additional analyses to\ndetermine the improvement to be expected from adding heat pipes.\nUpdating of the IRS thermal model and simulation of the design cases\nwere completed. Evaluation of the heat pipe proposals was completed and\nselection of a vendor is expected by November 25. Development of the\nthermal model of the PCA continued. Calculation of form factors, gray\nbodies, and radiation constants will begin by November 12.\nStress analyses of 4he alignment holding fixtures, alignment\nsimulators, and the cruciform envelope drawings were completed during\nthis period. Continued stress and dynamics work on the IRS and the OSP\nmount plate has resulted in a number of required design changes which\nare being implemented in the IRS and OSP mount drawings. Increased\nweight in the instrument electronics boxes supported by the IRS and in\nthe MSFC-designed OSP Sun shade baffles was the primary cause of the\nrequired redesign efforts.\nDeflection analyses of the cruciform-mounted instruments were\ndone in support of the thermal sensitivity analyses for on-orbit alignment and stability. Basedrive efforts were begun on the cruciform and\nPCA. Cruciform, PCA, and OSP analyses are proceeding on schedule.\nThe cruciform, PCA, and IRS Part I CEI Specifications were\nreviewed, finalized, and delivered to MSFC for baselining on October 28.\nPreliminary layout and design work was begun on the Astro MLI and cable\n\na\n\n{\n\nrouting drawings.\nDuring this period, work proceeded rapidly on the detail design\ndrawings for the Wide Field Camera (WFC). Several issues raised during\nthe informal PDR process were resolved. Thermal and stress models are\nunder development for the camera canister and a thermal model for the\ncamera\n\nelectronics\n\nbox\n\nis\n\nwell\n\nunderway.I\nl\n\ni\np\n8-2\nr\n\n7\n\n^.TJ\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nWBS 75.3 7_ Command Data/Communications Sy \xe2\x80\xa2 >tems Integration\nWe completed one section of the WFC breadboard to test the RAU\ncommand interpreter.

This was a key\nmeeting where MSFC and the PIs agreed on pointing accuracy and stability\ngoals.\nThe cruciform thermal stability sensitivity analysis was completed for 10 parametric cases and was presented to MSFC. A recommendation was made to add five heat pipes to the cruciform to improve thermal\nstability and thereby improve the probability of meeting the 2-arc-sec\nstability goal between the OSP platform and the telescopes. Coalignment\nbetween telescopes and stability between telescopes will also be\nimproved by addition of the heat pipes.\nA set of design weights was developed to establish the load\ncarrying capability of the IRS, the cruciform, and the PCA. These\ndesign weights were approved by the Mission Manager and were included in\nthe CEI specifications. Biweekly weight reports were also submitted to\nMSFC in which comparisons were made between estimated current weights\nand MPE limit weights.

The EAC\ndrawings and the EAC CEI Part I Specification are complete and will be\ndistributed for NASA review on November 16, 1983.\nThe SCU housing design was also completed during this reporting\nperiod.\n\n9-1\n\nl\n\nA\t\n\n9\n\nkF\nr\xc2\xb0\n\t\n\nThe System Control Unit (SCU) CCI Part I Specification was\nreleased for formal baselining.\nDuring this period, two SCU working group meetings were\nattended. The first meeting, held on October 27, 1983, introduced the\nSCU and its role in MSL. The status of the SCU, including individual\nboard design status and parts procurement status was discussed. The\nsecond meeting was held on November 8, 1983, and the status, schedule,\nand parts selection were discussed.\nDuring the period, the SCU schedule was revised to reflect\nchanges in requirements since initial schedule definition. The impact\nof the requirements changes resulted in a 2-week delay in delivery of\nthe flight unit, from June 1, 1983, to June 15, 1983. This delay does \t\n\nj\n\nnot impact the MSL system delivery date.\nOn October 5, 1983, a presentation was given to the EB lab on \t\n\np;\n\nthe SCU software. This presentation included a software requirement\noverview, a review of the software architecture, and the development \t\nb\n\napproach. The software requirements for both the SCU and SCU GSE are\nbeing documented with a Software Requirements Review scheduled for\nNovember 21, 1983. \t\n\ny F t\n\nOn October 20, 1983, a presentation on the SCU was given to NASA\nHeadquarters personnel during their visit to MSFC. The use of SCU in\nMSL, its hardware and software architecture, and the flexibility in\n\ngeneral of the SCU were discussed.\n\na\n\nWBS 75.3 - Command/Data/Communications Systems Integration\n\nWe completed a schematic for the Buffered Serial/Digital I/O\n(BSDIO) module including standard multibus interface.

Major design issues aysoci(it,!t] with\ndevelopment of the two-axis pointing system for use with BSXRT (Ind LAMAR\nwere addressed and total resource use estimates were refined. As a\nresult of these analyses, a more detailed mission concept was d(..\'.riv,,d\nand a higher confidence cost estimate for integrating the mission way^\ngenerated. Space Data Corporation under subcontract, developed a\nconcept for a two-axis system which would provide the required pointing\naccuracy and carry launch and landing loads with an axially Mounted\nbrake system. A concept for instrument mounting to the two-axis system\nwas defined and the use of a GSFC-provided star tracker and gyro system\nwas investigated for providing pointing information for the system. The\nresults of the study were presented to the GSFC Mission Management team\n\non October 26, 1983. This presentation and the distribution of the\nassociated documentation closed out the activities under this task.\n\n9-6\n\nv\n\n70.
