b'Solar Heliospheric & INterplanetary Environment (SHINE) Conference\n24-28 July, 2017, Saint-Sauveur, Quebec, Canada\nhttp://shinecon.org/CurrentMeeting.php\n\nSession 5: \xe2\x80\x9cSolar magnetic activity and solar-stellar connections\xe2\x80\x9d\nOrganizers: Irina Kitiashvili (NASA Ames & BAERI), Mausumi Dikpati (HAO, NCAR),\nTodd Hoeksema (Stanford University), Michael J. Thompson (HAO & NCAR), Ricky\nEgeland (HAO & Montana State University)\nPrediction of solar magnetic activity on various temporal scales is a fundamental element\nof space weather, which requires a wide range of theoretical and observational expertise\nin solar phenomena from the deep interior to the corona. Historical observations have\nrevealed many features of cyclic variations of the solar activity; but these data are\ndramatically insufficient to draw a physical picture of global magnetic field evolution.\nNew observational data, currently available from space missions and ground-based\nobservatories, provide us with detailed information about solar dynamics and magnetism.\nHowever, because of the relatively short duration of data series and the great variety of\ndata types and quality, it is challenging to assimilate these data in theoretical models and\nmake reliable forecasts. The recent unexpectedly weak solar activity cycles, as well as\nobservations of rotational and magnetic topology transitions in solar-type stars, suggest\nthat the Sun and its magnetic dynamo are currently in a very interesting evolutionary\nstage. This could relate to the difficulty in getting a model of the Sun to produce solarlike \xe2\x80\x93 rather than anti-solar-like \xe2\x80\x93 differential rotation, to reproduce the rotation profile\nobtained from helioseismology, and to predict solar activity cycles.\nThe proposed session will combine the expertise of observers, theoreticians and modelers\nand provide a unique platform to discuss the current status and challenges for\nunderstanding solar and stellar dynamics and activity on different temporal and spatial\nscales.\nDuring the session the following questions will be discussed:\n1) What are the important links between the solar dynamics and activity from the interior\nto the surface and corona?\n2) What additional observations would test the hypothesis that Sun-like stars undergo a\ntransition from large-scale to small-scale magnetic field topology?\n3) What additional observations and models are needed to reconstruct solar evolution to\nexplain current dynamical properties?\nSpeakers:\nTravis Metcalfe (Space Science Institute) \xe2\x80\x93 The solar-stellar connection and transition\nstate of the solar dynamo.\nLisa Upton (HAO) \xe2\x80\x93 Links between the solar dynamics and activity\n\n'
