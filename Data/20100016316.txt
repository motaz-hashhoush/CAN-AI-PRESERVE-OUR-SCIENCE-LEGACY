b'Aeroelasticity Benchmark Assessment\nSubsonic Fixed Wing Program\nInterim Report\nMarch 2010\nJennifer P. Florance, Pawel Chwalowski, and Carol D. Wieseman\nAeroelasticity Branch, NASA Langley Research Center\nIntroduction\nThe fundamental technical challenge in computational aeroelasticity is the accurate prediction of\nunsteady aerodynamic phenomena and the effect on the aeroelastic response of a vehicle.\nCurrently, a benchmarking \xe2\x80\x9cstandard\xe2\x80\x9d for use in validating the accuracy of computational\naeroelasticity codes does not exist. Many aeroelastic data sets have been obtained in wind-tunnel\nand flight testing throughout the world; however, none have been globally presented or accepted\nas an ideal data set. There are numerous reasons for this. One reason is that often, such\naeroelastic data sets focus on the aeroelastic phenomena alone (flutter, for example) and do not\ncontain associated information such as unsteady pressures and time-correlated structural dynamic\ndeflections. Other available data sets focus solely on the unsteady pressures and do not address\nthe aeroelastic phenomena. Other discrepancies can include omission of relevant data, such as\nflutter frequency and / or the acquisition of only qualitative deflection data. In addition to these\ncontent deficiencies, all of the available data sets present both experimental and computational\ntechnical challenges. Experimental issues include facility influences, nonlinearities beyond those\nbeing modeled, and data processing. From the computational perspective, technical challenges\ninclude modeling geometric complexities, coupling between the flow and the structure, grid\nissues, and boundary conditions. The Aeroelasticity Benchmark Assessment task seeks to\nexamine the existing potential experimental data sets and ultimately choose the one that is\nviewed as the most suitable for computational benchmarking. An initial computational\nevaluation of that configuration will then be performed using the Langley-developed\ncomputational fluid dynamics (CFD) software FUN3D1 as part of its code validation process.\nIn addition to the benchmarking activity, this task also includes an examination of future\nresearch directions. Researchers within the Aeroelasticity Branch will examine other\nexperimental efforts within the Subsonic Fixed Wing (SFW) program (such as testing of the\nNASA Common Research Model (CRM)) and other NASA programs and assess aeroelasticity\nissues and research topics.\nDrag Prediction Workshop Review\nThe SFW objective addressed by the Aeroelasticity Benchmark Assessment task is the\ndevelopment of prediction and analysis tools for reduced uncertainty in the design process. A\nsuccessful effort will result in identification of a focus problem for government, industry, and\nacademia to all use in demonstrating and comparing codes, methodologies, and experimental\ninformation to advance the state of the art. Ideally, such a focus problem would be but the first\nof many put forth for this purpose, with a future goal being the design, fabrication, and testing of\n\n\xe2\x80\xa9\n\n1\n\nan aeroelastic model specifically targeting acquisition of an \xe2\x80\x9cideal\xe2\x80\x9d data set for code validations.\nThe desire to have such a model has already been expressed within the computational\naeroelasticity community, and a committee within the NATO Research and Technology\nOrganization (RTO) has been tasked this year (2009 \xe2\x80\x93 2010) to investigate the possibility. An\nexcellent example of this progression and escalation of code validation in the international\ncommunity is the series of four AIAA CFD Drag Prediction Workshops that have been held\nsince 2001.\nAs part of the Aeroelasticity Benchmark Assessment task, the history of the AIAA CFD Drag\nPrediction Workshop series was reviewed. The overall focus of these workshops was on\nincreasing drag prediction accuracy. With this focus in mind, there were three objectives. The\nfirst objective was to assess the ease and practicality of using state-of-the-art computational\nmethods for load prediction. The second objective was to evaluate the effectiveness of these\nNavier-Stokes-based computer codes, and the final objective was to identify areas for\nimprovement. The first workshop occurred in June 2001 and utilized a subsonic wing/body\ntransport configuration flying at subsonic through transonic speeds. The second workshop\noccurred two years later, presenting results from a more complex transport configuration\nincorporating nacelles. For both cases, experimental data was available for comparison with the\nanalytical results being obtained prior to the workshop. The third workshop held in June 2006\ninvolved \xe2\x80\x9cblind\xe2\x80\x9d drag prediction, having participants run their codes with a modified version of\nthe configuration from the second workshop with no experimental data available before the\nworkshop for comparison. The fourth and most recent workshop was held in June 2009. This\nworkshop utilized a configuration designed for the sole purpose of aerodynamic CFD code\nprediction validation.2 Called the NASA Common Research Model (CRM), this configuration\nhas the following components: wing, body, nacelle, pylon, and horizontal-tail. As with the third\nworkshop, the prediction activity was intended to be \xe2\x80\x9cblind\xe2\x80\x9d, with experimental data unavailable\nfor comparison during the analysis cycle. In this case, though, the experimental data did not yet\nexist as the fabrication and testing of the NASA CRM was planned as a parallel activity.3 The\nfirst test of the CRM was recently completed in the NASA National Transonic Facility (NTF).\nResults of that test have not been distributed, but preliminary discussions with the test team have\nrevealed the possibility of an aeroelastic component (a dynamic pressure effect). The\nAeroelasticity Branch has begun a dialogue with the CRM test team to assess this data and\nprovide assistance if needed. A second test of the CRM is planned in the spring of 2010 in a\ndifferent facility (the Ames 11-Foot Tunnel) to help quantify experimental, facility-related\nuncertainty.\nThe structure of the Drag Prediction Workshop series provides a template for other CFD\ncommunities seeking similar improvements in accuracy within their own fields. The\nexamination and selection of aeroelastic data sets activity within the Aeroelasticity Benchmark\nAssessment task is viewed as one of the first steps for initiating such a process within the\ncomputational aeroelasticity community.\nAeroelastic Experimental Data Set Assessments and Selection\nAs mentioned previously, many experimental aeroelastic data sets have been produced, each\nwith its own strengths and weaknesses when viewed from the perspective of computational\n\n\xe2\x80\xa9\n\n2\n\nbenchmarking. A number of these data sets have been documented in references 4 and 5. For\nthe purposes of this task, an \xe2\x80\x9cexcellent\xe2\x80\x9d aeroelastic data set has been defined as one containing\n(1) extensive unsteady pressure measurements, (2) quantitative displacement / deflection\nmeasurements, (3) quantitative flow visualization measurements (for example, Schlieren and offbody velocity measurements), and (4) loads measurements acquired at both subsonic and\ntransonic conditions. The configuration tested should be simple enough that it can be modeled\nwithout adding an unnecessary level of uncertainty to the computational results. In addition,\nthere should be a high-quality definition of the model, including (1) well-documented geometry,\n(2) stiffness, mass, and inertia measurements, and (3) structural dynamic properties (natural\nfrequencies, mode shapes, and generalized mass). The type of aerodynamic and / or aeroelastic\nphenomena captured is also important since a validation process typically progresses from\nsimpler to more challenging cases. The accurate prediction of unsteady aerodynamic phenomena\nand their effect on the aeroelastic response of a vehicle is considered the first step in the current\nFUN3D validation process. Subsequent steps are envisioned to include validation of static\naeroelastic properties, limit-cycle oscillation (LCO), flutter, buffet, and control surface\neffectiveness. To be part of an \xe2\x80\x9cexcellent\xe2\x80\x9d data set, these aeroelastic phenomena should have\nwell-mapped, quantitative instability boundaries.\nTo begin the search for the best available data set for the FUN3D validation effort, distributable\ndata sets from the following sources were considered: (1) those discussed in references 4 and 5,\n(2) those produced in wind-tunnel tests at the NASA Langley Transonic Dynamics Tunnel\n(TDT), and (3) those presented to the NATO Research and Technology Organization (RTO).\nFor this interim report, only the data sets that made the \xe2\x80\x9ctop five\xe2\x80\x9d will be discussed. It should be\nnoted that the AGARD 445.6 wing data set, which has been widely used for code verification for\nover 20 years, was not a candidate in the current selection process. As will be discussed in a\nlater section of this report, the AGARD 445.6 wing data set was very limited in the type of data\navailable (primarily flutter points) and in the geometric and modal information provided, thus\neffectively removing it from consideration. This data set was used, however, during an initial\nand very limited FUN3D verification, where only one Mach number was run. This initial effort\nalong with expanded Mach runs from the same data set generated to gain familiarity with the\ncode will also be discussed in the later section.\nNASA Langley Benchmark Models Program (BMP)\nOne of the data sets considered was the aeroelastic data set generated with the first three models\nfrom the NASA Langley Benchmark Models Program (BMP)6. The purpose of this program\nwas to provide high-quality experimental unsteady aerodynamics data, particularly at flutter\nconditions, specifically to evaluate CFD codes for aeroelastic analysis. It was initiated in\nresponse to the lack of aeroelastic data sets available and suitable for validation efforts prior to\n1990. This program started with of a series of three geometrically simple wing models with the\nsame rectangular planform (32-inch span and 16-inch chord) that were tested in the TDT at\ntransonic test conditions throughout the 1990s. The following three airfoil sections with\ncorrespondingly different transonic performance characteristics were used for models one, two,\nand three, respectively: the NACA 0012 airfoil, the NACA 64A010 airfoil, and the NASA\nSC(2)-0414 supercritical airfoil. The models were constructed from aluminum in three sections\nthat were bolted together. For flutter testing, each model was mounted to the TDT Pitch and\n\n\xe2\x80\xa9\n\n3\n\nPlunge Apparatus (PAPA). This mounting system consists of four flexible circular rods and\npermits essentially uncoupled rigid body pitch and plunge modal motions. Instrumentation\nconsisted primarily of 80 unsteady pressure transducers, with 40 at the 60-percent span chordline\nand 40 at the 95-percent span chordline. Dynamic motion measurements were acquired\nprimarily via strain gages and accelerometers attached to the PAPA mount system. Only four\naccelerometers were included with the wing. Each of the models was tested in both air and R-12\nheavy gas, with conditions ranging from Mach 0.3 to 0.9. Angles-of-attack ranged from -3 to 5\ndegrees. Reynolds numbers for these tests were low, ranging between one and seven million\nbased on the wing chord. A grit strip located at 7.5 percent chord was also tested on each wing\nto investigate the effect of free versus forced flow transition. There was some effort during the\nprogram to acquire flow visualization data in the form of tufts and shear-sensitive liquid crystal\nsurface flow patterns. Overall, this is a very good aeroelastic data set and a good candidate for\nthis task. However, it does lack two desired components: quantitative displacement\nmeasurements and loads measurements.\nNASA Langley Benchmark Active Controls Technology (BACT)\nAnother data set considered came from the series of tests conducted in the TDT with the NASA\nLangley Benchmark Active Controls Technology (BACT) model7, 8, which was also part of the\nBenchmark Models Program. The purpose of this testing was to acquire high-quality\nexperimental unsteady aerodynamics data with static and dynamic control surface deflections.\nThe model also served as a testbed for active controls research. The BACT model was based on\nBMP model number one, with the same dimensions, geometry, and airfoil section (NACA 0012).\nThe BACT model, however, incorporated three hydraulically-actuated active control surfaces: a\n25-percent chord trailing-edge control surface, a 15-percent chord upper surface spoiler, and a\nmatching 15-percent chord lower surface spoiler. The spoilers were hinged at 60-percent chord,\nand all three surfaces extended between the 45- and 75-percent span stations. The wing portion\nof this model was machined from aluminum, while the control surfaces were of composite\nconstruction. As with the previous BMP models, the BACT model was instrumented with\nunsteady pressures at two chordlines. In this case, however, the majority of the transducers (58\nof them) were located at the 60-percent span station, which was the midspan of the control\nsurfaces. Seventeen additional unsteady pressures were located at the 40-percent span station\nover the aft portion of the chord (60- to 95-percent chord stations) to measure loading near the\ncontrol surface edges. The BACT model was tested on both a rigid strut for force balance\nmeasurements and on the TDT PAPA mount system for flutter and forced response data. The\nmodel was tested primarily in R-12 heavy gas, with only a limited amount of data in air.\nConditions ranged from Mach 0.63 to 0.94. Angles-of-attack ranged from -4 to 10 degrees.\nStatic trailing-edge control surface and spoiler deflections ranged from -10 to 12 degrees and 0 to\n40 degrees, respectively. Dynamic oscillations at frequencies up to 10Hz were achieved with all\nthree control surfaces, with amplitudes of 1 to 4 degrees for the trailing-edge control surface and\nup to 10 degrees for the two spoilers. A grit strip located at 5 percent chord was present\nthroughout testing. Overall, this is another very good aeroelastic data set from the BMP,\nparticularly for computational studies involving fixed-deflection and oscillating control surfaces.\nHowever, it lacks two desired components for the Aeroelasticity Benchmark Assessment task:\nquantitative displacement measurements and flow visualization measurements.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa9\n\n4\n\nNASA High-Speed Research (HSR) Program\nThe extensive aeroelastic data set generated by the NASA High-Speed Research (HSR) program\nwas also considered. Under this program, two models, the Rigid Semispan Model (RSM) and\nthe Flexible Semispan Model (FSM), were tested to acquire unsteady pressure data for both\ncomputational code evaluations and design method correlations.9 These two models had\nvirtually the same geometry and instrumentation. The designed difference was the model\nstiffness. The HSR-RSM was very stiff to intentionally minimize aeroelastic deflections. The\nHSR-FSM, on the other hand, had a flexible structure that was aeroelastically-scaled to\nanticipated flight conditions. The wings for both models were based on a high-speed civil\ntransport planform and were constructed of composite materials. A rigid fuselage fairing was\nalso used with each wing during the tests to ensure that the wing root was outside the tunnel wall\nboundary layer and to provide a realistic aerodynamic boundary condition. In addition to a\nclean-wing configuration, each model could be fitted with a pair of flow-through nacelles, and\nboth wings incorporated a hydraulically-actuated inboard trailing-edge control surface that could\nbe oscillated to generate unsteady aerodynamics data. The HSR-RSM was wall-mounted in the\nTDT using either a turntable / balance attachment, the TDT PAPA mount system, or the TDT\nOscillating Turntable (OTT). The HSR-FSM was primarily tested for flutter on a rigid strut\nattached to the turntable, with some limited subcritical response testing performed on the\nbalance. Both models were instrumented with 131 unsteady pressure transducers that were\ndistributed chordwise at four span stations (10-, 30-, 60-, and 95-percent span). Both the RSM\nand FSM wings also contained 14 accelerometers distributed throughout the planform. To\ncapture steady pressures on the rigid fuselage fairing, 120 steady pressure orifices were included\nat seven fuselage stations. Due to the flexible structure of the FSM wing, it was additionally\ninstrumented with four strain gages (one torsion and three bending). Several optical targets were\nalso attached near the wing tip for deflection measurements.\nTesting of the HSR-RSM and HSR-FSM models in both air and heavy gas (R-12 in 1996 and R134a after 1997) in the TDT began in 1996 and continued through 2000. Data was acquired for\nthe HSR-RSM from M = 0.6 \xe2\x80\x93 1.15 at dynamic pressures of 100, 150, and 200 psf. Steady data\nwas acquired at angles of attack from -5 to 8 degrees and control surface deflections from -5 to 5\ndegrees. Unsteady aerodynamics data was acquired from forced oscillation of the control surface\nat 0.25, 1, 2, and 5 degrees with frequencies of 1, 2, 5, or 10 Hz. Data was acquired for the HSRFSM from M = 0.8 \xe2\x80\x93 1.15 at dynamic pressures of 100, 125, and 150 psf. Steady data was\nacquired at angles of attack from -1 to 2.5 degrees and control surface deflections of -4 to 4\ndegrees. Forced oscillations for this configuration were conducted at various combinations of\ncontrol surface angle and frequency.10, 11\nThe aeroelastic data set generated from the HSR program is very good, providing both static and\ndynamic aeroelastic information for a computationally interesting planform. It includes\nextensive unsteady pressure data, displacement measurements at the wingtip, and loads\nmeasurements from both a balance and wing strain gages, but it lacks flow visualization. In\naddition, the construction of these wind-tunnel models, particularly the FSM, is geometrically\ncomplex with lockouts and flexible couplings that are difficult to model analytically. For a code\nvalidation effort, it was decided that this would add an unnecessary level of uncertainty.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa9\n\n5\n\nConsequently, it was removed from consideration as the initial data set. It would be a good\ncandidate for more intensive validation efforts in the future, though.\nHigh Reynolds Number Aero-Structural Dynamics (HIRENASD) Project\nThe data set generated in the European Transonic Windtunnel (ETW) through the High Reynolds\nNumber Aero-Structural Dynamics (HIRENASD) Project12, 13, 14 was also considered. This\nproject, led by the Rheinisch-Westf\xc3\xa4lische Technische Hochschule (RWTH) Aachen\nUniversity\xe2\x80\x99s Department of Mechanics (LFM) with funding from the German Research\nFoundation (DFG), was initiated in 2004 to produce a high-quality transonic aeroelastic data set\nat realistic flight Reynolds numbers for a large transport-type wing/body configuration. Ultimate\nfree and open distribution of the published data from this effort was also a top priority of the\nresearchers involved. The HIRENASD wing planform, shown in Figure 1, is a ceiling-mounted,\nsemi-span clean-wing configuration with a leading-edge sweep of 34 degrees, a span of 4.22\nfeet, and a mean aerodynamic chord of 1.13 feet. It consists of three sections. The two outboard\nsections utilize an 11-percent thick BAC 3-11/RES/30/21 supercritical airfoil. The inboard\nsection uses the same airfoil thickened linearly from 11-percent at its outer edge (11.25-inch\nspan station) to 15-percent at the root. To minimize boundary layer interference, a generic\nfuselage was included. It extended 3.54 inches from the tunnel ceiling and was mechanically\nisolated from the wing by a labyrinth seal. The span of the entire assembly from the tunnel\nceiling was 4.51 feet. Extensive measurements were acquired during testing of the HIRENASD\nmodel. Instrumentation included a six-component balance, Surface Pattern Tracking (SPT)\noptical markers for surface deformation measurements on the pressure side of the wing, 11\naccelerometers, 28 strain gages, and 259 unsteady pressure transducers. The pressure\ntransducers were distributed along the upper and lower surfaces at seven span stations (7.34,\n16.34, 23.08, 29.82, 33.17, 40.71, and 48.26 inches).\nTesting of the HIRENASD wind-tunnel model occurred in the ETW in 2006. The test matrix\nconsisted of both static and dynamic measurements at different flow conditions, with variations\nof Reynolds number (up to 73 million based on the mean aerodynamic chord) and dynamic\npressure (up to 2715 psf) at six transonic Mach numbers: 0.70, 0.75, 0.80, 0.83, 0.85, and 0.88.\nThe test medium was nitrogen. For static testing, pressure distribution and lift and drag polars\nwere acquired at angles of attack from -2 to 5 degrees. Dynamic testing involved forced\nvibrations of the wing at the first bending, second bending, and first torsion modes and was\nperformed at the zero lift angle of attack of -1.34 degrees.\nUltimately, the data set generated via the HIRENASD Project is very attractive for the SFW\nAeroelasticity Benchmark Assessment task, with a good distribution of unsteady pressure\nmeasurements, deflection measurements, and balance loads measurements at transonic\nconditions with realistic flight Reynolds numbers. The only item lacking from the \xe2\x80\x9cwish list\xe2\x80\x9d is\nflow visualization. Another benefit of this data set is the existence and availability of both a\nCFD grid and finite element model (FEM), reducing the preparation time needed before CFD\nruns could commence.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa9\n\n6\n\nFigure 1. HIRENASD wing model planform, assembly, and ETW installation photo.\nNOTE: Dimensions shown are in millimeters.\nNASA Langley Models for Aeroelastic Validation Research Involving Computations\n(MAVRIC) Program\nA fifth candidate data set considered in the assessment and selection process was the one\ngenerated by NASA Langley\xe2\x80\x99s Models for Aeroelastic Validation Research Involving\nComputations (MAVRIC) program.15, 16, 17 This program was specifically devised and\nimplemented in the late 1990s through 2000 to produce high-quality experimental data for\nhigher-level computational aeroelastic code validations at transonic flow separation onset\nconditions. For this program, researchers started with an existing aeroelastically-scaled model of\na business jet wing that had previously been tested in the TDT in 1993 and 1994, modifying it to\ninclude unsteady pressures and a more aerodynamically streamlined lower fuselage. This model\nwas chosen for its simple plate model construction and its demonstrated flutter and limit-cycle\noscillation (LCO) behavior in the 0.80 to 0.90 transonic Mach number range. The MAVRIC\nmodel, shown in Figure 2, is a semi-span, sidewall-mounted model with a span of 53.17 inches, a\ntaper ratio of 0.29, a midchord sweep angle of 23 degrees, and no twist or dihedral. The wing is\nconstructed of an aluminum plate, stepping in thickness from 0.276 inches at the root to 0.106\ninches at the tip in four increments across the span. Shaped endgrain balsa wood was glued to\nthe plate to provide the wing contour. The wing was mounted low on a fuselage body of\nrevolution that included a four-inch standoff section to account for the tunnel wall boundary\nlayer. Three wingtip configurations were used during testing: (1) a \xe2\x80\x9cclean\xe2\x80\x9d tip of revolution cap,\n(2) a 75-degree canted, swept winglet, and (3) a 0.5-inch cylindrical tip \xe2\x80\x9cpencil\xe2\x80\x9d store. Eighty\xe2\x80\xa9\n\n7\n\nfour two-psi unsteady pressure transducers were incorporated into the wing during the model\nrefurbishment. These were distributed along three chords at 22-, 63-, and 88-percent span, with\n17 transducers on the upper surface, 10 on the lower surface, and 1 at the trailing edge at each\nchord. Additional model instrumentation included 8 miniature accelerometers mounted near the\nleading and trailing edges at 26-, 45-, 68-, and 90-percent span, bending and torsion strain gages\nat the wing root, and two angle-of-attack sensors. Fifteen optical targets were placed on the\nmodel\xe2\x80\x99s lower surface along 5 rows (3 targets per row) to acquire dynamic deformation\nmeasurements using the NASA Langley-developed Videogrammetric Model Deformation\n(VMD) system.18 This system captured these deformations at a rate of 60 frames per second.\nTufts were added to the wing and fuselage during the latter portion of the test to visualize flow\nseparation. Instrumentation was also utilized to help assess tunnel wall and plenum influences\non the model data. For this purpose, seven pressure transducers were mounted along the\nsidewalls (4 in the east wall, 1 in the west wall, and 1 each in the floor and ceiling), and four\nB&K microphones were installed in the plenum.\nMAVRIC model testing was conducted in both air and R-134a heavy gas in the TDT in June\n2000. Comparison of results in the two mediums provided data on Reynolds number effects,\nflow transition effects, and the effect of speed of sound on LCO behavior. Traditional flutter\nboundaries were measured at Mach numbers from 0.6 to 0.9, and maps of LCO behavior were\nmade at Mach numbers from 0.85 to 0.95. Testing was performed primarily at three angles of\nattack: 0.6 degrees (zero wing loading), 1.6 degrees, and 2.1 degrees. VMD data was not\nacquired for all conditions due to initial difficulties in setting up the system. This data only\nexists for the latter half of the testing in R-134a.\nLike the HIRENASD data set, the MAVRIC data set is very attractive for the SFW\nAeroelasticity Benchmark Assessment task. It includes a good distribution of unsteady pressure\ntransducers (located both on the model and in the tunnel walls), dynamic deflection\nmeasurements, loads measurements via root strain gages, and some qualitative flow visualization\nfrom tufts. There are restrictions on the distribution of data involving the winglet configuration\nsince it is proprietary with the original manufacturer, but the other two configurations are\navailable. For the current benchmarking task, however, the LCO and flutter model behavior\noffered with this data set represents a more challenging class of phenomena to predict\ncomputationally. The MAVRIC data set is therefore not the ideal set required for the unsteady\naerodynamic phenomena prediction considered to be the first step in the current FUN3D\nverification process. It would be a top candidate, though, for further steps along the validation\npath.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa9\n\n8\n\nFigure 2. Photos of the MAVRIC model installed in the TDT.\nData Set Selection\nThe first data set selected to follow the AGARD 445.6 wing work for FUN3D code validation is\nHIRENASD. After reviewing the planning, development, testing, and published results of this\nproject, it was determined that this data set was the best candidate for the first step in the current\nvalidation process: accurate prediction of unsteady aerodynamic phenomena and their effect on\nthe aeroelastic response of a vehicle. Obvious benefits from this data set include the extensive,\nhigh-quality measurements and available CFD grid and FEM. Another benefit is that this data\nwas generated via a large cooperative effort in the ETW and has been available to the\ninternational CFD community for several years. There is therefore an opportunity here to have\naeroelastic CFD code assessments using HIRENASD data serve as the foundation for a\nworkshop series similar to those of the Drag Prediction Workshop series. In addition, the\nHIRENASD testing in the ETW is planned to continue, with the original configuration modified\nto include a winglet equipped with a control surface, as shown in Figure 3.19 The MAVRIC data\nset has been selected as the best candidate for follow-on validation work, specifically the\naccurate prediction of LCO and flutter. Preparation of this data set, FEM, and CFD grid are\nbeing worked concurrently with the HIRENASD computational benchmarking.\n\nFigure 3. Planned configuration-2 HIRENASD model modifications.\n\xe2\x80\xa9\n\n9\n\nFinite Element Model (FEM) Analysis and FUN3D Validation Efforts\nAGARD 445.6 Wing Data Set\nAs previously discussed, for verification of any aeroelastic CFD code, it is essential to have good\nexperimental data cases available. One flutter test case that has been publicly available for over\n20 years is the AGARD 445.6 wing.20, 21 This wing planform was sidewall-mounted, had a\nquarter-chord sweep angle of 45 degrees, a panel aspect ratio of 1.65, and a taper ratio of 0.66. It\nwas flutter tested in the TDT in both air and R-12 heavy gas at Mach numbers from 0.34 to 1.14.\nSince it became available, this configuration has been widely used for preliminary computational\nbenchmarking. Unfortunately, many of its flutter data sets lack sufficient geometric or modal\ninformation for more extensive code validations.22\nWhen the FUN3D code was initially exercised for validation in the year 2006, the AGARD\n445.6 wing test case was utilized. This validation was extremely limited, however, using only\none Mach number condition. In preparation for FUN3D validation using the HIRENASD and\nMAVRIC data sets, validation runs using the AGARD 445.6 wing were performed across the\nentire range of the experimental data. Figures 4 and 5 show comparisons of the flutter speed\nindex and frequency ratio values, respectively, obtained from previous CFD work, the current\nFUN3D predictions, and the experimental data. The flutter speed index scales the flutter\ndynamic pressure, and the frequency ratio scales the flutter frequency. In general, in the\nsubsonic flow regime, the computational data matches the experimental data well. A broad\nrange in the computational data is observed in the transonic and supersonic flow regimes.\n\nFigure 4. Flutter speed index (flutter dynamic pressure scaling) versus Mach number as\ncomputed by others and compared with FUN3D and experimental data.\n\xe2\x80\xa9\n\n10\n\nFigure 5. Frequency ratio (flutter frequency scaling) versus Mach number as computed by others\nand compared with FUN3D and experimental data.\nHIRENASD Data Set\nTesting of the HIRENASD wind-tunnel model occurred in the ETW in 2006. Numerous papers\nhave been published since then documenting a scattering of the results at a few of the test\nconditions. (See references 12-14, 19, and 23.) A complete data set for the published test\nconditions has been requested but not yet received from the HIRENASD Project lead researcher,\nDr. Josef Ballmann. Unpublished test conditions have not been released. The finite element\nmodels (FEMs), grid used with the CFD software SOFIA, sensor locations, pressure port\nlocations, and test matrix were obtained from the publicly available HIRENASD Project website,\nshown as reference 24.\nTwo different FEMs are available from the HIRENASD website. Both are modeled with\nuniform solid elements. One FEM uses NASTRAN hexagonal elements, has over 200k grid\npoints, and uses a coordinate system in millimeters. The other FEM uses NASTRAN tetrahedral\nelements, has approximately 170k grid points, and uses a coordinate system in meters. The two\nFEMs yield slightly different modal frequencies. However, these differences are small (less than\n1.3 percent), and the first ten mode shapes are virtually identical. Interestingly, these modes\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t exactly match those shown in the published reports because the boundary condition in both\navailable FEMs is different from the one used to generate that data. A current \xe2\x80\x9cbest FEM\xe2\x80\x9d has\nbeen requested.\nTo facilitate future linear aeroelastic calculations and interpolation of the mode shapes from the\nFEMs to the CFD locations, all of the grid locations were converted to a consistent aerodynamic\n\xe2\x80\xa9\n\n11\n\ncoordinate system in meters, where x is in the flow direction, y is out the span, and z is up. The\nrequired material card was also changed for the model that was converted from millimeters to\nmeters. Future planned FEM investigations include further modal analysis, static aeroelastic\nanalyses, and forced oscillations of the entire wing.\nThe initial, rigid body computations on the HIRENASD geometry using FUN3D are completed.\nThe lift and drag computations obtained across the angle of attack range at M = 0.8 and Reynolds\nnumber = 23.5 x 106 (based on the mean aerodynamic chord) for three grid resolutions of 5\n(coarse grid), 10 (base grid), and 20 (fine grid) million nodes are shown in Figures 6a and 6b,\nrespectively. In Figure 6a, the lift coefficient calculations are compared to the published rigid\nbody computational data generated by the CFD software SOFIA, which is provided in reference\n23. Unfortunately, similar drag coefficient data is not shown in Figure 6b since it has not been\npublished and has yet to be provided as part of the releasable data set by the HIRENASD team.\nThe grid resolution study indicates that the FUN3D solutions are not grid converged in drag\ncoefficient, and perhaps one more grid resolution is needed. However, in this study, the fine grid\nwill be used as the baseline grid for aeroelastic computations. The discrepancy in lift coefficient\nbetween FUN3D and SOFIA results shown in Figure 6a is due to the turbulence model used in\nthe analysis. The effects of different turbulence models will be investigated. Figure 7 shows a\ncomputed coefficient of pressure at one condition of interest: Mach = 0.8, alpha = 4 degrees, and\nReynolds number = 23.5 x 106 (based on the mean aerodynamic chord).\n\n(a) Lift coefficients versus alpha.\n\n(b) Drag coefficients versus alpha.\n\nFigure 6. FUN3D-computed lift and drag coefficients for the HIRENASD configuration.\nTunnel condition: M = 0.8, Reynolds number = 23.5 x 106 (based on the mean\naerodynamic chord).\n\n\xe2\x80\xa9\n\n12\n\nFigure 7. Sample FUN3D calculation of coefficient of pressure at M = 0.8, alpha = 4 degrees,\nand Reynolds number = 23.5 x 106 (based on the mean aerodynamic chord).\nWork being performed at the present time is concentrated on mode shape mapping from the\nFEM to the CFD grid and the subsequent static aeroelastic computations. Figure 8 shows an\nexample of the first-bending mode mapped from the NASTRAN FEM into the CFD grid.\n\nFigure 8. HIRENASD model first-bending mode mapped from the NASTRAN FEM into the\nCFD grid.\nMAVRIC Data Set\nTesting of the MAVRIC wind-tunnel model occurred in the TDT in June 2000. The data was\nsubsequently analyzed, and several papers were published. (See references 15-18.) However, a\ncomprehensive, releasable data set was never prepared, and the lead researchers on this program\n\xe2\x80\xa9\n\n13\n\nhave since retired or moved to different organizations within NASA Langley. Consequently,\nchallenges have been encountered in resurrecting and understanding the data and existing\ndocumentation that is available.\nThree original FEMs have been located and verified for the three MAVRIC configurations that\ncorrespond to the three different wingtips (clean-wing tip of revolution, winglet, and pencil\nstore). The clean-wing FEM is shown in Figure 9. In addition, there is an independent cleanwing FEM being developed by the University of Illinois, Champaign, which now has possession\nof the model and is performing work with it under an STTR. This FEM will be available for use\nas well. Considering the data restrictions discussed previously and the desire to keep things as\nsimple as possible, only the clean-wing configuration will be used for the current Aeroelasticity\nBenchmark Assessment task. To date, information from the flutter and modal analyses\nperformed in the past has been collected. Several of these cases have been re-run for\nverification, and additional analyses with the FEM will be done as needed to support the FUN3D\nvalidation effort.\n\nFigure 9. The MAVRIC clean-wing FEM.\nA review, evaluation, and cataloging of the experimental data is also ongoing. The wind-tunnel\ndata was acquired using three data acquisition systems. The first system (DAS-1), which\nsampled at 1000 Hz, captured all data channels except those associated with VMD. The second\nsystem (DAS-2) sampled only a limited number of channels at 5000 Hz in order to ascertain\ndifferences due to the sampling rate. The VMD system represents the third data acquisition\nsystem. To date, tools have been resurrected to visualize the data from all three systems, and a\ndata mining code is being implemented to assess data availability from each system and to help\nidentify points of interest and data trends. The major task with the experimental data is to\nidentify nominal conditions and conditions of interest that will make up the core of a releasable\n\xe2\x80\xa9\n\n14\n\ndata set. To assist in this effort, the MAVRIC program lead engineer, Dr. John Edwards, who is\ncurrently a NASA Distinguished Research Associate (DRA), has provided guidance is\nnavigating through the forest of information collected in binders from ten years ago. He is also\nassisting in the identification of the \xe2\x80\x9cinteresting\xe2\x80\x9d tunnel conditions / data points.\nPublished data for the MAVRIC program shows analytical results generated primarily using the\nFEM and linear doublet lattice aerodynamics. Computations were also performed with the\nComputational Aeroelasticity Program \xe2\x80\x93 Transonic Small Disturbance (CAP-TSD) code, which\nuses an interactive quasi-steady boundary-layer method coupled with a transonic small\ndisturbance code. No other CFD efforts were initiated. Unfortunately, the grid generated from\nthe CAP-TSD runs is not sufficient for or even compatible with other CFD codes, so grid\ndevelopment for the Aeroelasticity Benchmark Assessment task will be from scratch. The first\nstep in this process was to create a computer-aided design (CAD) model of the clean-wing\nconfiguration. Unfortunately, this was not a straightforward task since a complete outer-moldline definition was unavailable. Using drawings from the model refurbishment, an incomplete\nset of measured ordinates, information from tunnel installation photographs, and measurements\nprovided by the University of Illinois, Champaign (where the model temporarily resides), the\nGEOLAB at NASA Langley was able to build the desired CAD model, shown in Figure 10.\nThis was completed the week of March 15, 2010. The next step, also to be performed by the\nGEOLAB, is the generation of an unstructured grid.\n\nFigure 10. CAD model of the MAVRIC clean-wing configuration.\nFuture Work\nIn the remaining six months of the current fiscal year, both FEM and FUN3D work will continue\nfor both the HIRENASD and MAVRIC test cases. The review, evaluation, and cataloging of the\n\xe2\x80\xa9\n\n15\n\nMAVRIC experimental data will also continue, beginning the process of producing a MAVRIC\ncomprehensive data set package suitable for eventual distribution. In addition, the design,\nfabrication, and testing (in TDT and possibly ETW) of an aeroelastic model based on the NASA\nCRM planform will be advocated to the SFW program. Such a data set offering a wide\ndistribution of unsteady pressures, deflection measurements, flow visualization, and loads data\nwould be incredibly valuable to the computational aeroelasticity community. It would also be a\nnatural extension to the wind-tunnel testing and CFD work already performed on this planform\nas part of the AIAA Drag Prediction Workshop series.\nOver the next five years, it is envisioned that the Aeroelasticity Benchmark Assessment task will\nmature and expand into an international activity, similar to the AIAA CFD Drag Prediction\nWorkshop series. A rough timeline for this five-year plan is shown in Figure 11. Details for\neach fiscal year are listed below.\nFY11\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Continue validation work with HIRENASD and MAVRIC, studying the effects of tunnel\ncondition variations, grid variations, number of subiterations, etc.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Complete the MAVRIC comprehensive data set package.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Through STTR work by the University of Illinois, Champaign, there is interest in testing\nthe MAVRIC model again in the TDT. If funding is secured for such a test, then\nparticipate in the wind-tunnel test planning and entry.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 If funding is secured, initiate the design and fabrication of the aeroelastic CRM\n(AeCRM).\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Advocate for a Computational Aeroelasticity Workshop series.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Monitor the progress of the NATO RTO in its pursuit of the design, fabrication, and\ntesting of an aeroelastic model specifically for computational aeroelasticity validations.\nIs the interest still there? Has a funding mechanism been identified? Has a design been\ninitiated? Participate if appropriate.\nFY12\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Prepare for the first Computational Aeroelasticity Workshop. An excellent configuration\nwould be the HIRENASD model.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Complete fabrication of the aeroelastic CRM (AeCRM), conduct ground testing, and\nbegin wind-tunnel testing in the TDT.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Incorporate the new MAVRIC data from the University of Illinois, Champaign test into\nthe comprehensive data set.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Produce a report on the MAVRIC data set.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Continue monitoring progress of the NATO RTO computational aeroelasticity windtunnel model effort, participating when possible. It is envisioned that if funding was\nsecured in FY11, then model design would be accomplished this year.\nFY13\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Participate in the first Computational Aeroelasticity Workshop.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Update / improve the computational aeroelasticity codes based on results from the first\nworkshop.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Produce a report on the CFD results presented at the workshop.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa9\n\n16\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nConduct test number 2 of the aeroelastic CRM (AeCRM) in the TDT.\nAnalyze, compile, and begin documenting results from the AeCRM tests.\nContinue monitoring progress of the NATO RTO computational aeroelasticity windtunnel model effort, participating when possible. It is envisioned that if the model design\nwas completed in FY12, then fabrication of the model would be accomplished this year.\nThe Aeroelasticity Branch through the SFW program would potentially have a leading\nrole in this effort, similar to NASA Langley\xe2\x80\x99s role in the fabrication and testing of the\nNASA Common Research Model.\n\nFY14\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Prepare for the second Computational Aeroelasticity Workshop. An excellent\nconfiguration would be the MAVRIC clean wing. If sufficient experimental data exists,\nthe aeroelastic CRM could also be a candidate, but it would probably be more appropriate\nfor the third Computational Aeroelasticity Workshop, envisioned to be held in FY17.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Continue testing of the aeroelastic CRM (AeCRM) in the ETW (or other applicable\nfacility).\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Continue analyzing, compiling, and documenting results from the AeCRM tests.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Continue monitoring progress of the NATO RTO computational aeroelasticity windtunnel model effort, participating when possible. It is envisioned that if the model\nfabrication was completed in FY13, then testing of the model could begin this year in the\nTDT or the ETW. The Aeroelasticity Branch (AB) through the SFW program would lead\nthis test. AB would also participate in analyzing and compiling the test results and assist\nin both the FEM and CFD grid development.\nFY15\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Participate in the second Computational Aeroelasticity Workshop.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Update / improve the computational aeroelasticity codes based on results from the second\nworkshop.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Produce a report on the CFD results presented at the workshop.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Continue testing of the aeroelastic CRM (AeCRM) at AEDC (or other applicable\nfacility).\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Continue analyzing, compiling, and documenting results from the AeCRM tests.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Continue monitoring progress of the NATO RTO computational aeroelasticity windtunnel model effort, participating when possible. It is envisioned that testing would\ncontinue this fiscal year in the TDT and / or the ETW. Analysis of test results would also\ncontinue, and documentation would begin.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa9\n\n17\n\nFigure 11.
