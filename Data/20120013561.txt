No. 61/065,046, entitled\n"Homogeneous And Single-Side-Operational Connector\nMechanism For Self-Reconfigurable, Self-Assembly And\nSelf-Healing Systems," and filed by Wei-Min Shen et al. on\nFeb. 8, 2008, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated\nherein by reference.\nFEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH OR\nDEVELOPMENT\nThe research and development for inventions described in\nthis document received funding under NASA Grant No.\nNNA05CS38A from the National Aeronautics and Space\nAdministration. The U.S. Government may have rights to\nvarious technical features described in this document.\nTECHNICAL FIELD\nThis document relates to reconfigurable connectors and\ntheir applications.\nBACKGROUND\nThere exist many connection mechanisms. However, most\ndo not yet support single-end-operations. For example, connections using permanent magnets, electromagnetic force, or\nelectrostatic force may lose a connection unintentionally if\none end is out of service. Connections using physical latches\nand pins are mostly gendered and may be stuck permanently\nif one side is to malfunction.\nSUMMARY\nFlexible and reliable connection can be used for self-reconfiguration, self-assembly, and/or self-healing. Some\ndesigns for such connection mechanisms suffer from a deficiency that a connection would seize itself if one end malfunctions or is out of service. This document describes\nexamples of connectors that can establish or disengage a\nconnection even if one end of the connection is not operational. The connectors described are genderless and can\nchange the state of a connection from either end so as to\nprovide single-end-operations. The connectors may offer the\ndesired properties for flexibility, endurance, strength, and\nefficiency. Designs of single-end-operative reconfigurable\ngenderless connectors described here can include a base, a\nplurality of movable jaws that are formed on the base and can\nengage to the jaws of another connector, and an actuator that\nis mounted on the base and can engage and move the jaws of\nthe reconfigurable connector to connect the reconfigurable\nconnector with another connector.\nIn one aspect, a reconfigurable connector is disclosed that\ncan include a base; two or more movable jaws that are disposed on the base and configured to engage or disengage the\njaws of another connector to establish or break a connection\nbetween the reconfigurable connector and the other connector; and an actuator that is attached to the base and configured\n\n2\nto engage and drive the jaws of the reconfigurable connector\nto connect or disconnect the reconfigurable connector with\nthe other connector. The reconfigurable connector can establish or break the connection between the reconfigurable con5 nector and the other connector regardless of whether the other\nconnector is operational or whether the other connector has a\nfemale or male configuration.\nIn another aspect, a reconfigurable connector is disclosed\nthat can include a base; two or more movable jaws that are\nio disposed on the base and movable along a plurality of predetermined paths on the base respectively where the jaws are\ncapable of engaging or disengaging two or more jaws of\nanother identical connector when the jaws of the reconfigurable connector move in either direction along the predeter15 mined paths respectively; and an actuator that is attached to\nthe base and configured to engage and move the jaws of the\nreconfigurable connector in synchronization to connect or\ndisconnect the reconfigurable connector with another identical connector.\n20\nIn some embodiments, the reconfigurable connector can\ninclude four jaws that are movably engaged in four liner\nsliding rails respectively so that each jaw can move along its\nrespective sliding rail. The four sliding rails may be formed in\na cross configuration to meet at a center location of the base.\n25\nIn some embodiments, the reconfigurable connector can\nengage to the other connector when the four jaws of the\nreconfigurable connector move towards the center location of\nthe base. In some embodiments, the reconfigurable connector\ncan engage to the other connector when the four jaws move\n3o away from the center location. In some embodiments, the\nreconfigurable connector can engage to the other connector\nwhen the fours jaws move about halfway of the sliding rails.\nIn some embodiments, the actuator of the reconfigurable\nconnector can include a motorized circular gear that has con35 centric gear tracks to engage to the four j aws of the reconfigurable connector.\nIn some embodiments, the reconfigurable connector can\nalso include a device that communicates with another identical connector to be engaged to guide docking alignment\n4o between the two connectors. In some embodiments, the communicating device can also include a sensor that can signal for\ndocking guidance. In some embodiments, the communicating device can further include a controller that has a guidance\nalgorithm for docking process. In some embodiments, the\n45 sensor can sense the position of thejaws, as well as the proper\nengagement of the jaws when connected to the jaws of some\nother connectors.\nIn some embodiments, the jaws of the reconfigurable connector are shaped and arranged such that during engagement\n50 the reconfigurable connector and the other connector can\nautomatically align with each other in longitude, latitude,\nseparation, pitch, yaw or roll dimensions.\nIn another aspect, a robotic system is disclosed that can\ninclude two or more robotic modules; and two or more recon55 figurable connectors described above where at least two of the\nrobotic modules are connected by two of the reconfigurable\nconnectors.\nIn a further aspect, a device is disclosed that can include\ntwo or more reconfigurable connectors as described above\n60 where the reconfigurable connectors are engaged to one\nanother to form a chain.\nThe connectors described herein are genderless (homogeneous) and can be configured to realize desirable features\nsuch as strong and accurate mechanical linkage, long endur65 ance, thin profile, compliant for misalignment, power efficiency, communication, docking guidance, and potentially\noffers power sharing and reliability in rough environments.\n\nUS 8,234,950 B1\n3\nFor recoverability, the connectors can disconnect even if the\nother side is damaged. For self-assembly, the connector can\nconnect to another connector even if that connector is not\noperational. One feature of the connectors is the ability to\nreconfigure the connections between components and to\nautonomously join and disjoin components at will.\nDESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS\nFIGS. 1A-1D show various views of one example of a\ngenderless single-end releasable reconfigurable connector.\nFIG. 2 shows an experiment for single-end-operation or\nself-healing.\nFIGS. 3A-3F show self-configuration with robotic "SuperBot" modules.\nFIGS. 4A-4D show the six compliance dimensions (longitude, latitude, separation, pitch, yaw and roll) during autonomous docking.\nFIGS. 5A-513 show how the shape of connector jaws may\ncontribute to automatic alignment in longitude-latitude and\nseparation dimension during the engagement process.\nFIGS. 6A-613 show how the arrangement of connector j aws\nmay contribute to the maximum and minimum compliance in\nlongitude-latitude dimension.\nFIG. 7 shows compliance analysis in the roll dimension.\nFIG. 8 shows compliance in pitch/yaw dimension.\nLike reference symbols in the various drawings indicate\nlike elements.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION\nThis document describes a connector suitable for selfreconfigurable and self-healing systems. The unique features\nof the connector described may include the genderless (homogeneous) structure, strong and accurate mechanical linkage, long endurance, thin profile, compliant for misalignment, power efficient, supporting communication, docking\nguidance, and the possibility for sharing power. The connector can be seamlessly integrated with an existing self-reconfigurable robot, and can perform the desired compliance,\nspeed, accuracy, flexibility, efficiency, and endurance. These\nfeatures enable this connection mechanism to be useful in\nmany real-world applications. In some implementations, the\nconnector can be so designed as to endure dirt and become\nwaterproof in rough environments.\nA flexible and reliable connection mechanism can be used\nto realize the full potential of self-reconfigurable, self-assembling, and self-healing systems. Such a mechanism can be\nconfigured to enable the elements in a system to physically\nconnect and reconnect to form different configurations,\nshapes, and assemblies. Applications may include, among\nothers, self-assembly in space or underwater, self-reconfigurable robotic systems for multifunctional applications,\nreconfigurable and flexible manufacturing, reconfigurable\ntools/devices for dynamic situations.\nOne consideration for such connection mechanisms is that\nthey should be single-end-operative, that is, able to establish\nor disengage a connection even if one end of the connection is\nnot operational. This feature can be advantageous because\ncomponents in a system may be unexpectedly damaged or\ndeliberately taken out of service, yet the process of selforganization preferably should go on. In other words, it is\ndesirable that no connections be seized permanently or disconnect unintentionally.\nAnother consideration is the flexibility of the connection\nmechanism and whether it will allow any two components to\nconnect. In a self-reconfigurable system, there is a balance\n\n4\nbetween having homogeneous components (for lower cost)\nand heterogeneous functions (for more applications). At one\nextreme, all components may have homogeneous structures\nand functions but the system is over-redundant and ineffi5 cient. At the other extreme, all components may be unique\nand special but such a system is subject to single point failures. The connectors described herein may balance between\nthe two extremes by having homogeneous robotic skeleton\n"bone" modules to connect heterogeneous devices, such as\nio special sensors, actuators, power suppliers, tools, and protective shields. A reconfigurable genderless connector, such as\nthe exemplary connector illustrated in FIGS. 1A-1D, may\nallow any two components to connect without gender restrictions imposed by their connectors and may allow one con15 nector to connect to another connector even if that connector\nis not active.\nReconfigurable connectors are connectors that can change\ntheir configurations to change their connections with other\nconnectors. A reconfigurable connector can be motorized by\n20 one or more motor actuators to adjust its connection configuration. One of the applications of a reconfigurable connector\nis self-reconfigurable robotic modules and systems to make\nconnections with other modules in 3D configurations (e.g.,\nfront, back, left, right, up, and down).\n25\nFIGS. 1A-1D show an exemplary embodiment of a singleend-operative and genderless connector for self-reconfiguration, self-assembly and self-healing. The connector 100 has a\nconnector base 110 on which four movable connector jaws\n120a-d are formed on one side to provide the single-end\nso releasable connection operation. Four linear connector sliding rails 130a-d are formed in a symmetric cross configuration and meet at a center location (similar to a chuck). The\nconnector j aws 120a-d are movably engaged in the connector\nsliding rails 130a -d, respectively so that each connector jaw\n35 can move along its respective connector sliding rail in directions 122a-d. In operation, the connector jaws 120a-d can\nmove towards the center to engage to another connector and\naway from the center to disengage or vice versa depending on\nwhich two connectors are engaged to each other. The connec40 for jaws 120a-d are shaped to engage to corresponding connector jaws of another such connector either in the central\narea within corresponding connector jaws of another such\nconnector or outside the corresponding connector jaws of\nanother such connector. To connect two such connectors, the\n45 four connector jaws on one connector are engaged to the four\nconnector jaws of another connector to form a solid connection. To release, the four connector jaws on one connector are\ndriven to be closed or open to disengage with the other connector. The shape of the jaw can be so designed as to offer\n50 compliance during connector engaging and disengaging.\nFIGS. 1A-113 show that the connector base 110 is structured to have four open slots 140a -d that are under the sliding\nrails 130a -d, respectively, to expose a motorized circular gear\n150 mounted on the other side of the connector base 110 that\n55 is engaged to the connector jaws 120a-d and drives the connector jaws 120a-d along their sliding rails 130a -d, respectively. The motorized circular gear 150 has top spiral or concentric gear tracks 152 that are engaged to the bottoms of the\nconnector jaws 120a-d. As the motorized circular gear 150\n60 rotates, the connector jaws 120a-d move along the radial\ndirection of the motorized circular gear 150 along their\nrespective sliding rails 130a -d, respectively.

This sequence shows that the connectors as shown\nin FIGS. 1A-1D can be completely integrated with the SuperBot and can align, establish, and disengage connections in a io\nself-reconfigurable robotic system.\nTo provide the guidance for docking alignment, a connector designed based on the teachings of this document can use\neither Infrared LEDs or laser signals for both docking guidance and communication between neighboring modules. The 15\ncommunication devices will be arranged in such a way that\nwhen two such connectors are aligned they will have the\nmaximal signal receptions. Guidance algorithms can be\ndeveloped for the docking process, including both alignment\nand the control of relative motions between the two docking 20\nconnectors. To protect the connectors while the robot is walking on rough terrain, this new design can hold a protective\nshield to prevent the open connectors from directly touching\nthe ground. This mechanism can dock to the feet connectors\nas reconfigurable "walking shoes."\n25\nDuring the docking process, if two sides are both active,\nthen they can enter the desired state by communicating and\nnegotiating which side is moving inwards and which side\noutwards. If only one side is active, then it can sense (e.g., via\na camera) the state of the inactive partner (i.e., the positions of 30\nthe jaws), and then decide how to move its own jaws (i.e.,\ninward or outward) when approaching to dock.\nOne consideration for any connection mechanism for selfreconfiguration, self-healing and self-assembly is compliance for autonomous docking. During reconfiguration, con - 35\nnectors approach to and align with each other before\nestablishing the connection. However, due to the uncertainties in sensing and control and the disturbance from the environment, alignment may not be perfect. Thus, a connector\nshould preferably be able to tolerate these uncertainties when 40\nestablishing the connection. The more a connector is tolerant\nto misalignment, the better it is for autonomous docking.\nThe connectors described herein are designed so as to have\nsufficient compliance in the six dimension of the alignment,\nincluding longitude, latitude, separation, pitch, yaw, and roll. 45\nThese situations are illustrated in FIGS. 4A-4D.\nFIG. 4A shows two SuperBot modules 470a-b. Module\n470a has a connector 475a at one of its ends and module 470b\nhas another connector 475b at one of its ends. Modules\n470a-b are positioned on the same level with the two connec- 50\ntors 475a-b facing towards each other where modules 470a-b\ncan engage to each other along the longitude and/or latitude\ndimension of their position level. The longitude and latitude\ndimensions are equivalent to the x and y dimensions in a\nCartesian coordinate system.\n55\nFIG. 4B also shows two SuperBot modules 470a-b, each\nwith a connector at one of its end. Connector 475a is attached\nto module 470a and connector 475b is attached to module\n470b. Modules 470a-b are positioned on different levels with\nthe two connectors 475a-b facing towards each other. At this 60\nconfiguration, modules 470a-b can engage to each other\nalong the separation dimension of the different module levels.\nThe separation dimension is equivalent to the z dimension in\na Cartesian coordinate system.\nFIG. 4C also shows two SuperBot modules 470a-b with 65\ntwo connectors 475a-b facing towards each other and separately attached to their respective module. Module 470a-b are\n\n8\npositioned at the same level but with an angle where modules\n470a-b can engage to each other in the pitch and/or yaw\ndimension. The pitch and yaw dimensions are the V and 0\ndimensions in a spherical coordinate system.\nFIG. 4D also shows two SuperBot modules 470a-b that are\naligned along their centerlines. Module 470a has a connector\n475a at one of its ends and module 470b has another connector at one of its ends. The two connectors 475a-b face towards\neach other which allows modules 470a-b engage to each other\nin the roll dimension. The roll dimension is the r dimension in\na spherical coordinate system.\nThe compliance of the connectors mainly comes from two\nfactors: (1) the shape of the connector jaws, and (2) the\narrangement of the connector jaws. To illustrate how the\nshape of connector jaws may contribute to the compliance,\nFIGS. 5A and 5B show the cross-sectional view and side view\nof the jaws during engagement. In FIGS. 5A and 513, two\nsquares 590a-b with dashed line are used to schematically\nrepresent two connectors. The diagonal lines of each square\nrepresent the sliding rails on the connectors along which the\njaws of the connectors can move. For each connector, a\nshaded area is used to represent one of its jaws. In this case,\nshaded area 595a represents one of the jaws of the connector\nshown by square 590a, and shaded area 595b represents one\nof the jaws of the connector shown by square 590b. The\nmatched slopes of the jaw shape can guide and force the two\nengaging jaws to automatically align with each other. As\nshown in FIG. 5A, movement of jaw 595a towards jaw 595b\nor movement of jaw 595b towards j aw 595a or both along the\nlongitude and/or latitude dimension (as indicated by the\narrows) will force the two jaws 595a-b to automatically align\nwith each other. Similarly, as shown in FIG. 513, movement of\njaw 595a towards j aw 595b or movement of jaw 595b towards\njaw 595a or both along the separation dimension (as indicated\nby the arrows) will also force the two jaws 595a-b to automatically align with each other.\nTo illustrate how the arrangement of the connector jaws\nmay contribute to the compliance, FIGS. 6A and 6B show the\npossible misalignment of two connectors in the longitude and\nlatitude dimensions. Similar to FIGS. 5A and 513, in FIGS. 6A\nand 6B two squares 690a-b with dashed line are also used to\nschematically represent the two connectors. The diagonal\nlines of each square also represent the sliding rails on the\nconnectors along which the j aws of the connectors can move.\nThe bigger circle 695a indicates that the four j aws of connector 690a are open, and the small circle 695b indicates that the\nfour jaws of connector 690b are closed. FIG. 6A shows the\ncompliance, (50-15)=35 mm, when the rails of two engaging\nconnectors are aligned but the jaws are not. In this case, the\nclosing of the outerjaws (the bigger circle 695a) will force the\ninnerjaws (the small circle 695b) to the center. FIG. 6B shows\nthe compliance when the rails and jaws are both misaligned.\nIn this case, the outer jaws 695a will rely on their shape to\nforce alignment of the inner jaws 695b. The max allowed\nmisalignment is equal to the half width of the jaws. In this\nprototype, the half width of a jaw is 5.0 mm.\nIn the separation dimension, a misalignment means that the\ntwo connectors starting the engagement when they are not yet\ntouching each other and there is still a gap space between\nthem (see, e.g., FIG. 513). In this case, the connectors must\nrely on the shape of the connector jaws to bring them closer.\nThe maximal compliance in this case is equal to the height of\nthe jaw, which is 6.0 mm in this prototype.\nThe compliance in the roll dimension is illustrated in the\nFIG. 7, where two connectors are aligned along the centerline, but with an error in the roll. Similar to FIGS. 5A-513 and\n6A-613, in FIG. 7 two squares 790a-b with dashed line are also\n\nUS 8,234,950 B1\n9\n\n10\n\nused to schematically represent the two connectors.

No. 61/065,046, entitled\n"Homogeneous And Single-Side-Operational Connector\nMechanism For Self-Reconfigurable, Self-Assembly And\nSelf-Healing Systems," and filed by Wei-Min Shen et al. on\nFeb. 8, 2008, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated\nherein by reference.\nFEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH OR\nDEVELOPMENT\nThe research and development for inventions described in\nthis document received funding under NASA Grant No.\nNNA05CS38A from the National Aeronautics and Space\nAdministration. The U.S. Government may have rights to\nvarious technical features described in this document.\nTECHNICAL FIELD\nThis document relates to reconfigurable connectors and\ntheir applications.\nBACKGROUND\nThere exist many connection mechanisms. However, most\ndo not yet support single-end-operations. For example, connections using permanent magnets, electromagnetic force, or\nelectrostatic force may lose a connection unintentionally if\none end is out of service. Connections using physical latches\nand pins are mostly gendered and may be stuck permanently\nif one side is to malfunction.\nSUMMARY\nFlexible and reliable connection can be used for self-reconfiguration, self-assembly, and/or self-healing. Some\ndesigns for such connection mechanisms suffer from a deficiency that a connection would seize itself if one end malfunctions or is out of service. This document describes\nexamples of connectors that can establish or disengage a\nconnection even if one end of the connection is not operational. The connectors described are genderless and can\nchange the state of a connection from either end so as to\nprovide single-end-operations. The connectors may offer the\ndesired properties for flexibility, endurance, strength, and\nefficiency. Designs of single-end-operative reconfigurable\ngenderless connectors described here can include a base, a\nplurality of movable jaws that are formed on the base and can\nengage to the jaws of another connector, and an actuator that\nis mounted on the base and can engage and move the jaws of\nthe reconfigurable connector to connect the reconfigurable\nconnector with another connector.\nIn one aspect, a reconfigurable connector is disclosed that\ncan include a base; two or more movable jaws that are disposed on the base and configured to engage or disengage the\njaws of another connector to establish or break a connection\nbetween the reconfigurable connector and the other connector; and an actuator that is attached to the base and configured\n\n2\nto engage and drive the jaws of the reconfigurable connector\nto connect or disconnect the reconfigurable connector with\nthe other connector. The reconfigurable connector can establish or break the connection between the reconfigurable con5 nector and the other connector regardless of whether the other\nconnector is operational or whether the other connector has a\nfemale or male configuration.\nIn another aspect, a reconfigurable connector is disclosed\nthat can include a base; two or more movable jaws that are\nio disposed on the base and movable along a plurality of predetermined paths on the base respectively where the jaws are\ncapable of engaging or disengaging two or more jaws of\nanother identical connector when the jaws of the reconfigurable connector move in either direction along the predeter15 mined paths respectively; and an actuator that is attached to\nthe base and configured to engage and move the jaws of the\nreconfigurable connector in synchronization to connect or\ndisconnect the reconfigurable connector with another identical connector.\n20\nIn some embodiments, the reconfigurable connector can\ninclude four jaws that are movably engaged in four liner\nsliding rails respectively so that each jaw can move along its\nrespective sliding rail. The four sliding rails may be formed in\na cross configuration to meet at a center location of the base.\n25\nIn some embodiments, the reconfigurable connector can\nengage to the other connector when the four jaws of the\nreconfigurable connector move towards the center location of\nthe base. In some embodiments, the reconfigurable connector\ncan engage to the other connector when the four jaws move\n3o away from the center location. In some embodiments, the\nreconfigurable connector can engage to the other connector\nwhen the fours jaws move about halfway of the sliding rails.\nIn some embodiments, the actuator of the reconfigurable\nconnector can include a motorized circular gear that has con35 centric gear tracks to engage to the four j aws of the reconfigurable connector.\nIn some embodiments, the reconfigurable connector can\nalso include a device that communicates with another identical connector to be engaged to guide docking alignment\n4o between the two connectors. In some embodiments, the communicating device can also include a sensor that can signal for\ndocking guidance. In some embodiments, the communicating device can further include a controller that has a guidance\nalgorithm for docking process. In some embodiments, the\n45 sensor can sense the position of thejaws, as well as the proper\nengagement of the jaws when connected to the jaws of some\nother connectors.\nIn some embodiments, the jaws of the reconfigurable connector are shaped and arranged such that during engagement\n50 the reconfigurable connector and the other connector can\nautomatically align with each other in longitude, latitude,\nseparation, pitch, yaw or roll dimensions.\nIn another aspect, a robotic system is disclosed that can\ninclude two or more robotic modules; and two or more recon55 figurable connectors described above where at least two of the\nrobotic modules are connected by two of the reconfigurable\nconnectors.\nIn a further aspect, a device is disclosed that can include\ntwo or more reconfigurable connectors as described above\n60 where the reconfigurable connectors are engaged to one\nanother to form a chain.\nThe connectors described herein are genderless (homogeneous) and can be configured to realize desirable features\nsuch as strong and accurate mechanical linkage, long endur65 ance, thin profile, compliant for misalignment, power efficiency, communication, docking guidance, and potentially\noffers power sharing and reliability in rough environments.\n\nUS 8,234,950 B1\n3\nFor recoverability, the connectors can disconnect even if the\nother side is damaged. For self-assembly, the connector can\nconnect to another connector even if that connector is not\noperational. One feature of the connectors is the ability to\nreconfigure the connections between components and to\nautonomously join and disjoin components at will.\nDESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS\nFIGS. 1A-1D show various views of one example of a\ngenderless single-end releasable reconfigurable connector.\nFIG. 2 shows an experiment for single-end-operation or\nself-healing.\nFIGS. 3A-3F show self-configuration with robotic "SuperBot" modules.\nFIGS. 4A-4D show the six compliance dimensions (longitude, latitude, separation, pitch, yaw and roll) during autonomous docking.\nFIGS. 5A-513 show how the shape of connector jaws may\ncontribute to automatic alignment in longitude-latitude and\nseparation dimension during the engagement process.\nFIGS. 6A-613 show how the arrangement of connector j aws\nmay contribute to the maximum and minimum compliance in\nlongitude-latitude dimension.\nFIG. 7 shows compliance analysis in the roll dimension.\nFIG. 8 shows compliance in pitch/yaw dimension.\nLike reference symbols in the various drawings indicate\nlike elements.\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION\nThis document describes a connector suitable for selfreconfigurable and self-healing systems. The unique features\nof the connector described may include the genderless (homogeneous) structure, strong and accurate mechanical linkage, long endurance, thin profile, compliant for misalignment, power efficient, supporting communication, docking\nguidance, and the possibility for sharing power. The connector can be seamlessly integrated with an existing self-reconfigurable robot, and can perform the desired compliance,\nspeed, accuracy, flexibility, efficiency, and endurance. These\nfeatures enable this connection mechanism to be useful in\nmany real-world applications. In some implementations, the\nconnector can be so designed as to endure dirt and become\nwaterproof in rough environments.\nA flexible and reliable connection mechanism can be used\nto realize the full potential of self-reconfigurable, self-assembling, and self-healing systems. Such a mechanism can be\nconfigured to enable the elements in a system to physically\nconnect and reconnect to form different configurations,\nshapes, and assemblies. Applications may include, among\nothers, self-assembly in space or underwater, self-reconfigurable robotic systems for multifunctional applications,\nreconfigurable and flexible manufacturing, reconfigurable\ntools/devices for dynamic situations.\nOne consideration for such connection mechanisms is that\nthey should be single-end-operative, that is, able to establish\nor disengage a connection even if one end of the connection is\nnot operational. This feature can be advantageous because\ncomponents in a system may be unexpectedly damaged or\ndeliberately taken out of service, yet the process of selforganization preferably should go on. In other words, it is\ndesirable that no connections be seized permanently or disconnect unintentionally.\nAnother consideration is the flexibility of the connection\nmechanism and whether it will allow any two components to\nconnect. In a self-reconfigurable system, there is a balance\n\n4\nbetween having homogeneous components (for lower cost)\nand heterogeneous functions (for more applications). At one\nextreme, all components may have homogeneous structures\nand functions but the system is over-redundant and ineffi5 cient. At the other extreme, all components may be unique\nand special but such a system is subject to single point failures. The connectors described herein may balance between\nthe two extremes by having homogeneous robotic skeleton\n"bone" modules to connect heterogeneous devices, such as\nio special sensors, actuators, power suppliers, tools, and protective shields. A reconfigurable genderless connector, such as\nthe exemplary connector illustrated in FIGS. 1A-1D, may\nallow any two components to connect without gender restrictions imposed by their connectors and may allow one con15 nector to connect to another connector even if that connector\nis not active.\nReconfigurable connectors are connectors that can change\ntheir configurations to change their connections with other\nconnectors. A reconfigurable connector can be motorized by\n20 one or more motor actuators to adjust its connection configuration. One of the applications of a reconfigurable connector\nis self-reconfigurable robotic modules and systems to make\nconnections with other modules in 3D configurations (e.g.,\nfront, back, left, right, up, and down).\n25\nFIGS. 1A-1D show an exemplary embodiment of a singleend-operative and genderless connector for self-reconfiguration, self-assembly and self-healing. The connector 100 has a\nconnector base 110 on which four movable connector jaws\n120a-d are formed on one side to provide the single-end\nso releasable connection operation. Four linear connector sliding rails 130a-d are formed in a symmetric cross configuration and meet at a center location (similar to a chuck). The\nconnector j aws 120a-d are movably engaged in the connector\nsliding rails 130a -d, respectively so that each connector jaw\n35 can move along its respective connector sliding rail in directions 122a-d. In operation, the connector jaws 120a-d can\nmove towards the center to engage to another connector and\naway from the center to disengage or vice versa depending on\nwhich two connectors are engaged to each other. The connec40 for jaws 120a-d are shaped to engage to corresponding connector jaws of another such connector either in the central\narea within corresponding connector jaws of another such\nconnector or outside the corresponding connector jaws of\nanother such connector. To connect two such connectors, the\n45 four connector jaws on one connector are engaged to the four\nconnector jaws of another connector to form a solid connection. To release, the four connector jaws on one connector are\ndriven to be closed or open to disengage with the other connector. The shape of the jaw can be so designed as to offer\n50 compliance during connector engaging and disengaging.\nFIGS. 1A-113 show that the connector base 110 is structured to have four open slots 140a -d that are under the sliding\nrails 130a -d, respectively, to expose a motorized circular gear\n150 mounted on the other side of the connector base 110 that\n55 is engaged to the connector jaws 120a-d and drives the connector jaws 120a-d along their sliding rails 130a -d, respectively. The motorized circular gear 150 has top spiral or concentric gear tracks 152 that are engaged to the bottoms of the\nconnector jaws 120a-d. As the motorized circular gear 150\n60 rotates, the connector jaws 120a-d move along the radial\ndirection of the motorized circular gear 150 along their\nrespective sliding rails 130a -d, respectively. Depending on\nthe direction of the rotation 154 of the motorized circular gear\n150, the connector jaws 120a-d can move either towards the\n65 center to be close to one another or away from the center to be\napart from one another. Because the connector jaws 120a-d\nare driven by the common motorized circular gear 150, the\n\nUS 8,234,950 B1\n5\n\n6\n\nconnector j aws 120a-d are move in synchronization with one\nmanipulation.

This sequence shows that the connectors as shown\nin FIGS. 1A-1D can be completely integrated with the SuperBot and can align, establish, and disengage connections in a io\nself-reconfigurable robotic system.\nTo provide the guidance for docking alignment, a connector designed based on the teachings of this document can use\neither Infrared LEDs or laser signals for both docking guidance and communication between neighboring modules. The 15\ncommunication devices will be arranged in such a way that\nwhen two such connectors are aligned they will have the\nmaximal signal receptions. Guidance algorithms can be\ndeveloped for the docking process, including both alignment\nand the control of relative motions between the two docking 20\nconnectors. To protect the connectors while the robot is walking on rough terrain, this new design can hold a protective\nshield to prevent the open connectors from directly touching\nthe ground. This mechanism can dock to the feet connectors\nas reconfigurable "walking shoes."\n25\nDuring the docking process, if two sides are both active,\nthen they can enter the desired state by communicating and\nnegotiating which side is moving inwards and which side\noutwards. If only one side is active, then it can sense (e.g., via\na camera) the state of the inactive partner (i.e., the positions of 30\nthe jaws), and then decide how to move its own jaws (i.e.,\ninward or outward) when approaching to dock.\nOne consideration for any connection mechanism for selfreconfiguration, self-healing and self-assembly is compliance for autonomous docking. During reconfiguration, con - 35\nnectors approach to and align with each other before\nestablishing the connection. However, due to the uncertainties in sensing and control and the disturbance from the environment, alignment may not be perfect. Thus, a connector\nshould preferably be able to tolerate these uncertainties when 40\nestablishing the connection. The more a connector is tolerant\nto misalignment, the better it is for autonomous docking.\nThe connectors described herein are designed so as to have\nsufficient compliance in the six dimension of the alignment,\nincluding longitude, latitude, separation, pitch, yaw, and roll. 45\nThese situations are illustrated in FIGS. 4A-4D.\nFIG. 4A shows two SuperBot modules 470a-b. Module\n470a has a connector 475a at one of its ends and module 470b\nhas another connector 475b at one of its ends. Modules\n470a-b are positioned on the same level with the two connec- 50\ntors 475a-b facing towards each other where modules 470a-b\ncan engage to each other along the longitude and/or latitude\ndimension of their position level. The longitude and latitude\ndimensions are equivalent to the x and y dimensions in a\nCartesian coordinate system.\n55\nFIG. 4B also shows two SuperBot modules 470a-b, each\nwith a connector at one of its end. Connector 475a is attached\nto module 470a and connector 475b is attached to module\n470b. Modules 470a-b are positioned on different levels with\nthe two connectors 475a-b facing towards each other. At this 60\nconfiguration, modules 470a-b can engage to each other\nalong the separation dimension of the different module levels.\nThe separation dimension is equivalent to the z dimension in\na Cartesian coordinate system.\nFIG. 4C also shows two SuperBot modules 470a-b with 65\ntwo connectors 475a-b facing towards each other and separately attached to their respective module. Module 470a-b are\n\n8\npositioned at the same level but with an angle where modules\n470a-b can engage to each other in the pitch and/or yaw\ndimension. The pitch and yaw dimensions are the V and 0\ndimensions in a spherical coordinate system.\nFIG. 4D also shows two SuperBot modules 470a-b that are\naligned along their centerlines. Module 470a has a connector\n475a at one of its ends and module 470b has another connector at one of its ends. The two connectors 475a-b face towards\neach other which allows modules 470a-b engage to each other\nin the roll dimension. The roll dimension is the r dimension in\na spherical coordinate system.\nThe compliance of the connectors mainly comes from two\nfactors: (1) the shape of the connector jaws, and (2) the\narrangement of the connector jaws. To illustrate how the\nshape of connector jaws may contribute to the compliance,\nFIGS. 5A and 5B show the cross-sectional view and side view\nof the jaws during engagement. In FIGS. 5A and 513, two\nsquares 590a-b with dashed line are used to schematically\nrepresent two connectors. The diagonal lines of each square\nrepresent the sliding rails on the connectors along which the\njaws of the connectors can move. For each connector, a\nshaded area is used to represent one of its jaws. In this case,\nshaded area 595a represents one of the jaws of the connector\nshown by square 590a, and shaded area 595b represents one\nof the jaws of the connector shown by square 590b. The\nmatched slopes of the jaw shape can guide and force the two\nengaging jaws to automatically align with each other. As\nshown in FIG. 5A, movement of jaw 595a towards jaw 595b\nor movement of jaw 595b towards j aw 595a or both along the\nlongitude and/or latitude dimension (as indicated by the\narrows) will force the two jaws 595a-b to automatically align\nwith each other. Similarly, as shown in FIG. 513, movement of\njaw 595a towards j aw 595b or movement of jaw 595b towards\njaw 595a or both along the separation dimension (as indicated\nby the arrows) will also force the two jaws 595a-b to automatically align with each other.\nTo illustrate how the arrangement of the connector jaws\nmay contribute to the compliance, FIGS. 6A and 6B show the\npossible misalignment of two connectors in the longitude and\nlatitude dimensions. Similar to FIGS. 5A and 513, in FIGS. 6A\nand 6B two squares 690a-b with dashed line are also used to\nschematically represent the two connectors. The diagonal\nlines of each square also represent the sliding rails on the\nconnectors along which the j aws of the connectors can move.\nThe bigger circle 695a indicates that the four j aws of connector 690a are open, and the small circle 695b indicates that the\nfour jaws of connector 690b are closed. FIG. 6A shows the\ncompliance, (50-15)=35 mm, when the rails of two engaging\nconnectors are aligned but the jaws are not. In this case, the\nclosing of the outerjaws (the bigger circle 695a) will force the\ninnerjaws (the small circle 695b) to the center. FIG. 6B shows\nthe compliance when the rails and jaws are both misaligned.\nIn this case, the outer jaws 695a will rely on their shape to\nforce alignment of the inner jaws 695b. The max allowed\nmisalignment is equal to the half width of the jaws. In this\nprototype, the half width of a jaw is 5.0 mm.\nIn the separation dimension, a misalignment means that the\ntwo connectors starting the engagement when they are not yet\ntouching each other and there is still a gap space between\nthem (see, e.g., FIG. 513). In this case, the connectors must\nrely on the shape of the connector jaws to bring them closer.\nThe maximal compliance in this case is equal to the height of\nthe jaw, which is 6.0 mm in this prototype.\nThe compliance in the roll dimension is illustrated in the\nFIG. 7, where two connectors are aligned along the centerline, but with an error in the roll. Similar to FIGS. 5A-513 and\n6A-613, in FIG. 7 two squares 790a-b with dashed line are also\n\nUS 8,234,950 B1\n9\n\n10\n\nused to schematically represent the two connectors.
