The team, however, was experiencing some frustration. Every time they tried to create a solid composite from the polyimide (an advanced polymer) material, it bubbled and foamed. It seemed like the team had reached a dead end in their research - until they had another idea. \"We said, This isn t going to work for composites, but maybe we could make a foam out of it,\" Weiser says. \"That was kind of our eureka moment, to see if we could go in a whole other direction. And it worked.\" Weiser and his colleagues invented a new kind of polyimide foam insulation they named TEEK. The innovation displayed a host of advantages over existing insulation options. Compared to other commercial foams, Weiser explains, polyimide foams perform well across a broad range of temperatures, noting that the NASA TEEK foams provide effective structural insulation up to 600 F and down to cryogenic temperatures. The foam does not burn or off-gas toxic fumes, and even at -423 F - the temperature of liquid hydrogen - the material stays flexible. The inventors could produce the TEEK foam at a range of densities, from 0.5 pounds per cubic foot up to 20 pounds per cubic foot, making the foam ideal for a range of applications, including as insulation for reusable launch vehicles and for cryogenic tanks and lines. They also developed a unique, friable balloon format for manufacturing the foam, producing it as hollow microspheres that allowed the foam to be molded and then cured into any desired shape - perfect for insulating pipes of different sizes and configurations. The team s originally unplanned invention won an \"R&D 100\" award, and a later form of the foam, called LaRC FPF-44 (Spinoff 2009), was named \"NASA Invention of the Year\" in 2007.", "title": "Polyimide Foams Offer Superior Insulation", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-25T19:45:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2012-02-15T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20120001909, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20120001909, "id": "0024f4c6d4374a6f982eb7630fb61494", "publicationName": "Spinoff 2011", "publicationDate": "2012-02-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 20120001873, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "Spinoff 2011", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20120001909.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20120001909/downloads/20120001909.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20120001909/downloads/20120001909.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20120001909/downloads/20120001909.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
