b'ASA\'s effort to help private industry develop and\ncommercialize new applications of remote sensing\nincludes, in addition to the VIP program (see page\n48), a governmentlindustry cooperative program known\na s EOCAP, for Earth Observation Commercial\nApplications Program.\nEOCAP provides government co-funding to encourage\nprivate investment in, and broader use of, NASA developed technology for gathering and analyzing information\nabout Earth\'s land and ocean resources. Like VIP, EOCAP\nis managed by Stennis Space Center, but the programs\ndiffer in other ways: VIP generally involves short-term\nprojects of three to six months and NASA funds the project; EOCAP projects can run three years or more and\nfunding is shared on a 50-50 basis.\nAn EOCAP example is an important project that\noffers benefit potential to U.S. pipeline companies. These\ncompanies face ever-increasing operating and regulatory\npressures that require mapping, inventories of facilities,\npipe inspections, rehabilitation, environmental reporting,\nand facilities safety and notification programs. Keeping\ntrack of the facilities and updating associated records is a\nmonumental task.\nOne obvious answer is automation and several\npipeline companies have implemented Automated\nMappingRacilities ManagemenVGeographic Information\nSystems (AM/FM/GIS).\nBut setting up an AMiFM/GIS and keeping it up to\ndate is a costly and time-consuming endeavor. The cost of\nnew photogrammetric mapping is significant; county and\nU.S. Geological Survey maps are not sufficiently detailed;\nand manual handling of hundreds of thousands of aerial\nphotos is difficult.\nJames W. Sewall Company, Old Town, Maine, an\nAM/FM/GIS consulting firm, saw a solution. Looking for\nways to help its customer -- Algonquin Gas Transmission\nCompany, Boston, Massachusetts -- Sewall proposed an\nEOCAP project to develop a computerized system for storing and retrieving digital aerial photography of pipeline\nrights-of-way. The system would provide an accurate\ninventory of rights-of-way locations and pipeline surroundings for engineering, maintenance and regulatory\npurposes. Other project objectives included adapting a\n\nN\n\nNASA-developed digital camera system for pipeline monitoring, and uniting the digital aerial images acquired with\nan AM/FM/GIS system being developed by Algonquin to\nreplace its manual method of mapping and information\nmanagement.\nNASA accepted the proposal and Stennis Space\nCenter joined with Sewall, Algonquin and NASA\'s Science\nand Technology Laboratory (located a t Stennis) to implement the development effort. Begun in 1990, the project\nwas largely concluded in 1993; the final phase, full operation of Algonquin\'s image-based AM/FM/GIS known a s\nMAPS (Mapping Algonquin\'s Pipeline System), was nearing completion in 1994.\nAn important byproduct of the EOCAP project was\nStennis Space Center\'s development of the Digital Aerial\nRights-of-way Monitoring System (DARMS), a PC-based\ncharge coupled device digital camera integrated with a\nlarge capacity recorder. DARMS was installed in one of\nSewall\'s twin-engine Aztec aircraft for operational testing\nand development of imagery for the EOCAP project. In\naddition to its use in pipeline management, DARMS has\nexcellent potential in such applications a s transportation,\nmunicipal map updating and environmental monitoring;\nits advantage over traditional aerial photography is substantial time and money savings, particularly when the\ndigital imagery is used in an AM/FM/GIS.\nAt left, Sewall employee Richard St. Pierre is working on a DARMS plot. At right above is a closeup of a\nDARMS screen showing the land image in black and white\nand the pipeline in false color, highlighting the important\nmap features for the client. At right is a sampling of\nDARMS maps and the 8-millimeter Exabyte tapes used to\ncollect and store the data from a pipeline survey.\nThe EOCAP experience enabled Sewall to develop\nnew products and to expand its customer base in pipeline\nmonitoring and other markets. Since undertaking the project, Sewall has tripled the size of its AM/FM/GIS division\nand extended its operations into the international marketplace. And for Sewall\'s customer, Algonquin Gas\nTransmission, the EOCAP project has provided technology\nfor managing regulatory requirements more efficiently\nand more accurately.\n(Continued)\n\nhanges on Earth\'s surface are becoming more\nextensive and they are occurring more rapidly\nthan ever before. The changes become more significant a s the planet\'s population grows and the available\nland base declines. Planners and resources managers\nneed a reliable way to assess the consequences of change\nby detecting, quickly and accurately, changes in the way\nland is used.\nPacific Meridian Resources, Emeryville, California\nteamed with NASA on an EOCAP project to develop a system for monitoring changes in land cover and land use,\nincorporating the latest change detection technologies\n(which have advanced significantly in recent years) and\nfactoring in the economic, political and biological issues\nrelevant to a particular land use problem.\n\nThe goal of the project was not to develop new technologies, but to tailor existing technologies to a comprehensive system that could be commercialized for a variety\nof users. The objective, a s stated by the project team.\nwas "to take existing geographic informat~onsystem (GIs)\nand satellite Image processing technologies and develop\nproduction-oriented methods and services for assessing\nand monitoring land usehand cover change."\nThe EOCAP project was a broad-based effort involving NASA, the Portland (Oregon) Metropolitan Service\nDistrict, the Washington State Department of Natural\nResources, other government agencies and private organizations; each contributed funds, imagery and/or personnel\ntime. The primary thrust of the project was development\nof a Land Use and Cover Change Analysis System of meth-\n\nods to assess land cover change over time; land cover\nchanges would then be related to land use change, which\nin turn would be associated with demographic and economic change.\nFor change detection input, Pacific Meridian used\nimagery acquired by the Thematic Mapper (TM) aboard\nthe NASA-developed Landsat satellite, specifically summertime scenes of the Portland metropolitan area taken\nthree years apart (1988-91). The major aim was to identify areas that had sustained substantial loss of vegetation, principally through timber harvesting and\ndevelopmental activities. At left is a Landsat TM change\ndetection image covering the Olympic Peninsula that\nshows (in magenta) areas that sustained an appreciable\nloss of vegetation, green a gain, blue no change in a vegetated area, white no change in a barren area (no change\nmeans a gain or loss of less than 30 percent of the vegetation cover). Above is a summary image of 1988-91\nchange in the Portland Metropolitan District; red indicates a loss of vegetation, green a gain, blue no change in\na vegetated area, white no change in a barren area (no\n\nchange means a gain or loss of less than 30 percent of the\nvegetation cover).\nPacific Meridian was successful in accomplishing the\nprimary EOCAP objective, development of image processing methods to identify change, measure the extent of\nchange, and update GIs maps to incorporate the change.\nThe company plans further investigation to link land\ncovernand use change to environmental and economic\nimpacts; additionally, it plans to increase marketing activities to boost the exposure and acceptance of its change\ndetection products.\nPacific Meridian considers the EOCAP project "a\nvital component for the development of future services to\nits clientele." EOCAP participation helped Pacific\nMeridian to stay on the cutting edge of change detection\ntechniques by providing R&D funding, a commodity not\noften available to young, rapidly growing companies.\nPartially as a result of the EOCAP project, Pacific\nMeridian has grown from six employees in a single office\nto 6 0 in five offices, and annual revenues have increased\nfrom $200,000 to $3,500,000.\n\n'
