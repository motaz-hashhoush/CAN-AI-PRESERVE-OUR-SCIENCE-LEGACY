Such understanding could lead to the develtallinity, low melting point (for materials shot at approxiopment of new materials that would self-heal in a variety of\nmately 25\' C.), and the ability to melt flow.

When the panel was shot at 80\xc2\xb0 C. no cracks\nradiated from the bullet hole, but the hole did not seal. Small\npieces of material pulled away from the back of the panel, but\nwere still attached to the panel. A ring around the impact site\nresulted (20 mm diameter), which was due to the impact of the\nbullet. It appears that the immediate surroundings of the bullet\nsite were influenced by the bullet penetration, and only the\npolymer within that circular stress can partake in whether this\nmaterial will seal.

It was believed\nthat the vinyl acetate component would decrease the crystallinity of the polymer relative to pure polyethylene. This\nwould allow the polymer to flow before crystallizing too\n50 quickly, unlike polyethylene. Also, highly crystalline polymers are known to have low impact strengths. The hole did\nseal after being shot, but only as a dimple protruding from the\nback of the panel. The hole tapers from impact side to exiting\nside of the panel. The appearance of the dimple was transpar55 ent, which may be due to the polymer not crystallizing to a\nlarge extent at that site. ELVAX\xc2\xae 660 has similar tensile\nstrength as SURLYNO, but a much lower tensile modulus and\nhigher percent elongation. It appears that the tensile modulus\nis an important factor in the ability of the material to absorb\n60 impact from a bullet. The modulus of ELVAX\xc2\xae 660 appears\nto be too low to absorb enough of the impact to raise the\ntemperature to a point where the polymer can flow. Possibly\nthe crystallinity is still too high (28%) to self-heal to a greater\nextent, even though the melting points are relatively low.\n65 High density polyethylene was tested as a standard to compare with SURLYNO and ELVAX\xc2\xae 660. The results were\nthat the material had a hole with a diameter of 7 mm through\n\n45\n\nUS 8,063,171 B2\n7\nthe panel, with cracks radiating from the hole. It is known that\npolymers with high degrees of crystallinity and large spherulitic structures have low impact strength. Such polymers\nwould be poor candidates for self-healing polymers due to the\nlow impact strength. The results from this polymer suggest 5\nthat the ability to self-heal is dependent upon the crystalline\nproperties of the polymer. Since this polymer had a constant\nhole through the panel and ELVAX\xc2\xae 660 had a hole that\ntapered towards the back of the panel, it appears that the\nhigher degree of crystallinity of HDPE (68%) relative to io\nELVAX\xc2\xae 660 is one reason for the difference in residual\ndamages between these two polymers.\nSURLYN\xc2\xae 8940 is a copolymer of ethylene and partially\nneutralized methacrylic acid. When this material is shot, the\nhole seals with a different appearance, depending upon the 15\nbullet velocity. At higher velocities there is a small central\npoint in the dimple that protrudes outwards on the penetration\nside of the panel in a kind of "crater"-shaped appearance. The\ndepth of the internal cavity of the "crater" increases as bullet\nvelocity increases. At 1118 ft/sec a depth of 4 mm remained 20\nwith a diameter of 1.5 mm (impression had a 6 mm width). It\nappears that the material snaps back after bullet penetration.\nAt all velocities there is a small conical protrusion on the exit\nside of the panel. The low degree of crystallinity of this\npolymer (19%) may play an important part in its self-healing, 25\nalong with its low melting points.\nNUCREL\xc2\xae 925 is a copolymer of ethylene and methacrylic acid. When this material is shot at 24\xc2\xb0 C., the hole\nseals. The hole does not heal to same extent as SURLYN\xc2\xae\n8940 under the same conditions. This may due to the size of 30\nthe lamella. The lamellar thickness in NUCREL\xc2\xae is larger\nthan in SURLYN\xc2\xae. The smaller lamellar size may allow for\neasier melting of the lamella, and hence a greater amount of\nmaterial is available to flow after the material is shot. At 13\xc2\xb0\nC. NUCREL\xc2\xae 925 does not heal completely, while SUR- 35\nLYN\xc2\xae 8940 does heal.\nTONES P787 is poly(caprolactone). It has very similar\nthermal and tensile properties as SURLYN\xc2\xae 8940. Whereas\nSURLYN\xc2\xae 8940 has two melting peaks due to cluster orderdisorder transition (50\xc2\xb0 C.) and polyethylene crystallites 40\nmelting (90\xc2\xb0 C.), TONES P787 has one melting transition\n(56\xc2\xb0 C.). TONES P787 has a hole with a diameter of 1.5 mm\nthat is 5.5 mm deep, with the remaining hole sealed, when\nshot at approximately 900 ft/sec. The results of TONES P787\ntesting indicate that the presence of ionic clusters is not a 45\nrequirement for a polymer to seal upon bullet penetration. It\nappears that it is a combination of good tensile properties\nalong with a moderate level of crystallinity and a low melting\npoint. The methacrylic acid units break up the crystallinity of\npolyethylene in SURLYN\xc2\xae. This may be a major reason why 50\nSURLYN\xc2\xae 8940 seals and polyethylene does not.\nNUCREL\xc2\xae 925, which is the acid analog of SURLYN\xc2\xae,\ndoes seal at ambient temperatures, but not as effectively as\nSURLYN\xc2\xae 8940 at lower temperatures. TONES P787 may\nhave smaller spherulitic structures than HDPE, which may be 55\na reason why it seals and HDPE cracks and does not heal.\nThe degree of crystallinity of SURLYN\xc2\xae 8940 (15.7%) is\nmuch less than that of TONES P787 (55.4%). The percent\ncrystallinity of poly(ethylene-co-methacrylic acid) ionomers,\nbased upon heat of melting values, is approximately 10-20% 60\nrelative to 100% crystalline polyethylene. Poly(caprolactone)\nhas a degree of crystallinity of approximately 40-50% based\nupon 100% crystalline poly(caprolactone). Polycaprolactone\nalso crystallizes very quickly. This higher degree of crystallinity, larger crystal size, and fast crystallization rate may be 65\nwhy TONES P787 does not heal as well as SURLYN\xc2\xae. More\nenergy is required to melt a material with a higher degree of\n\n8\ncrystallinity than those with a lower degree of crystallinity.\nAlso, the fast crystallization rate limits how much material\nflows before it cools. TONES P787 may have smaller crystal\nstructures than HDPE, whichmay be why it has higher impact\nstrength than HDPE.\nBoth SURLYN\xc2\xae 8940 and NUCREL\xc2\xae 925 heal upon\nbullet penetration at 24\xc2\xb0 C. NUCREL\xc2\xae 925 leaves an impression with a greater depth than SURLYN\xc2\xae 8940 (1.5 mm vs.\n0.5 mm). The SURLYN\xc2\xae 8940 sample was 7.0 mm thick and\nthe NUCREL\xc2\xae was 6.5 mm thick. Both dimples are 9 mm in\ndiameter, which is the diameter of the bullet used in thi s study.\nBoth samples display radial cracks emanating from the interior of the puncture to the exterior of the puncture. SURLYN\xc2\xae 8940 has a more pronounced cone on the exit side of\nthe panel than NUCREL\xc2\xae 925.\nTwo other grades of TONES, TONES P757 and TONES\nP767, were tested and compared to TONES P787. TONES\n757 is the lowest molecular weight polymer of the series and\nthe greatest melt flow of the three polymers. The initial diameter of the hole is 4.0 mm and tapers towards the back of the\npanel. The hole is 5.0 mm deep. The back of the panel has a\nslight convex shape where the bullet passed through the\npanel. TONES P767 has properties in between P757 and\nP787. The initial hole was 2.0 mm, which tapered towards the\nback of the panel. The back of the panel was very similar in\nappearance as P757. Increasing melt viscosity may be the\nreason for smaller residual damage in the TONES series. The\nincreased melt viscosity may allow the polymer to snap back\nto a greater extent after the bullet passes through the panel.\nA series of very low density polyethylenes (VLDPEs) were\nstudied to compare to HDPE. These VLDPEs included:\nFLEXOMER\xc2\xae DFDB-9042 NT, FLEXOMER\xc2\xae ETS-9078\nNT 7, AFFINITY\xc2\xae PL 1850G, and AFFINITY\xc2\xae EG8200G.\nThe FLEXOMER\xc2\xae series is based upon ethylene-l-butene\ncopolymers, while the Affinity\xc2\xae series is based upon ethylene-l-octene copolymers. It was speculated that long sidechain branching would reduce crystallinity to the point where\nthe polymer could withstand the impact of the bullet, as well\nas being able to flow without crystallizing too quickly.\nBoth FLEXOMER\xc2\xae polymers tested had similar results.\nX-ray analysis showed that both polymers were about 30%\ncrystalline, which were much lower than. HDPE. Also, both\nofthese polymers hadregions of low melting points (Table 1),\nwhich should be in the temperature range obtained by the\nimpact site after the bullet passes through the panel. FLEXOMER\xc2\xae DFDB-9042 NT had a hole that persisted about\n85% of the way into the panel, but was sealed the rest of the\nway. FLEXOMER\xc2\xae ETS-9078 NT7 had a hole that persisted\nthrough the panel, ending in a 0.5 mm hole at the end of a\nsmall cone-shaped protrusion on the back of the panel. Both\npolymers showed a high degree of crystallization, as evidenced by the second heat of melting values. Perhaps the\ndegree of crystallinity and the rate of crystallization prohibited these polymers from healing well.\nThe AFFINITY\xc2\xae polymers behaved very different from\none another. The AFFINITY\xc2\xae PL185OG result was very\nsimilar to FLEXOMER\xc2\xae DFDB-9042 NT. The hole in\nAFFINITY\xc2\xae PL185OG persisted 85% of the way into the\npanel, leading to a transparent protrusion on the back of the\npanel. This transparency is probably due to lack of crystallinity, much the same as in the case of ELVAX\xc2\xae 660. AFFINITY\xc2\xae EG820OG sealed as well as SURLYN\xc2\xae 8940. Due to\nthe low degree of crystallinity (19%), the polymer was transparent and rubber-like in appearance. A line of dark-colored\nmaterial remains through the polymer, which may be due to\nthe metal of the bullet.

The\nmolded panel had apparent regions of stress as evidenced by\nthe opaque regions in the panel. It was believed that the\nuneven cooling of the polymer led to this result. The portion\nof the polymer that was shot in the opaque region did not heal\nas well as the portion shot in the transparent region. Even\nthough both regions healed, the transparent portion healed\nbetter with no residual depth to the remaining hole. On the\nback of the panels there were indentations going slightly\ninwards towards the panel. This polymer has a much lower\ntensile modulus (21.5\xc2\xb11.4 MPa) than TONES P787. This\npolymer has a higher tensile modulus than VISTALON\xc2\xae\n4709 (3.8\xc2\xb10.8 MPa), and both have relatively the same melting points (45\xc2\xb0 C. vs. 49\xc2\xb0 C.). It appears that the poly(esteramide) has a large enough tensile modulus to absorb enough\nof the impact to allow melt flow of the polymer. This may\nindicate that there is a minimum limiting value on the tensile\nmodulus to allow the polymer to self-heal. Another possibility is that 5 has better melt flow properties than VISTALON\xc2\xae\n4709.\nAnother poly(ester-amide) (6) was synthesized from ethylene glycol, azelaic acid, and 11-aminoundecanoic acid with\nan increased nylon 11 component (33 mol %). This polymer\nalso was rubbery in nature. The low heat of melting values,\nand x-ray data, also indicate a low degree of crystallinity. This\npolymer also had residual areas of stress due to uneven cooling of the panel upon compression molding. The polymer\nself-healed upon bullet penetration, but the damage was\nslightly greater than the previous 5. The back of the panel was\nsmooth except for a slight amount of melted polymer sticking\nout. The tensile modulus of this polymer (33.4\xc2\xb15.1 MPa) was\ngreater than 5 (21.5\xc2\xb11.4 MPa). The difference cannot be\nexplained due to the tensile moduli.\nFinally, a polyester was synthesized containing aromatic\nunits in an attempt to increase tensile properties while maintaining a sufficient percent elongation. A polyester containing\nethylene glycol, 1, 1 2-dodecanedioic acid, and 14 mol %p-a,\na"-xylenediol was synthesized and found to self-heal to a\nmuch lesser extent than the other new polymers in this paper.\nThe tensile modulus of this polymer (296.5\xc2\xb117.1 MPa) was\nsimilar to other self-healing polymers in this work (SURLYN\xc2\xae, TONES P787, 2). Incorporation of the aromatic\ngroups also seemed to lower impact resistance because the\nback of the panel at the impact site had slight cracking along\nwith the slight protrusions emanating from the panel.\nThe polymers studied in the work describes herein offer\nsome insight into the understanding of why SURLYN\xc2\xae 8940\nself-heals after bullet penetration. Impact resistance was\nfound to be an essential feature of self-healing polymers.\nPolymers with low impact resistance may self-heal, but\ncracking of those panels are very detrimental. The cracking\nlowers the tensile properties of the polymer, and also leads to\nareas where gases can penetrate through the cracks. These\npolymers would not be suitable for use in atmospheric containment in space.\nThe self-healing success of AFFINITY\xc2\xae EG8200G\nrevealed that ionic content is not required for self-healing\npolymers. The low melting points, low crystallinity, good\nmelt flow, and sufficient mechanical properties to raise the\ntemperature at impact site appear to lead to the ability of this\npolymer to self-heal. Polymers exhibiting melt index values\nabove about 2.5 g/10 min. as determined by mass flow rate\nunder ASTM D 123 8 at 190\xc2\xb0 F., 2.16 kg weight and at least\n\n12\nsome of the foregoing properties exhibit the best self-healing\nproperties. Although the low melting points may limit the\nupper use temperature of this polymer, it is sufficient for use\nin space objects since the temperature is approximately 25\xc2\xb0 C.\n5 The tendency of TONES P787 to self-heal also led to the\ninitial syntheses of a variety of aliphatic polyesters, poly\n(ester-amide)s, and aromatic-aliphatic polyesters. These\npolymers displayed varying degrees of self-healing ability.\nThe polyesters and poly(ester-amides) described above\nl0\nwere synthesized using standard melt-condensation techniques. Tetrabutyl orthotitanate or dibutyltin oxide was used\nas the catalyst. After initial esterification at 200\xc2\xb0 C. for 3 h,\nhigh vacuum was applied and the temperature was increased\n15 to 260\xc2\xb0 C. Polymerizations were carried out until the polymers formed a ball around the stir blade.\nThe polymers were compression molded under vacuum\ninto 3"x3" or 6"x6" panels between KAPTON\xc2\xae films. Compression molding temperatures and pres sures were dependent\n20 upon the properties of each polymer. Tensile bars were\nmolded using a Dynisco Polymer Test Laboratory Mixing\nMolder equipped with an Athena Temperature Control Unit.\nTensile bars were molded using an ASTM D1708 mold. One\npolymer was punched out of a thin panel using an ASTM\n25 D638-5 modified mold.\nBallistic testing was accomplished by clamping the polymers into a stand before being shot. Temperature control\ncould be obtained using an oven with a 3" diameter hole cut in\nit to allow the bullet to pass through the oven. A Smith &\n30 Wesson semiautomatic pistol, equipped with a laser sight, on\na gun stand was used as the weapon. Bullet velocities were\ncontrolled by appropriate powder loading of the bullets (9\nmm). The location of chronographs before and after the panel\n35 recorded velocities before and after impact. A steel backstop\nfilled with sandbags stopped the bullets. These tests were\nperformed at NASA Langley Research Center.\nThe properties of the recited polymers were obtained using\na Sintech 2W Instron according to ASTM D1708 or ASTM\n40 D638 at crosshead speeds of 0.2"/min or 2.0"/min, depending\nupon polymer elongations. Differential scanning calorimetry\nwas conducted using a Perkin-Elmer Pyris 1 Differential\nScanning Calorimeter. X-ray analysis on molded samples\nwere analyzed using a Siemens D5000 diffractometer\n45 (CuK(x, Ni filtered, 45 kV, 40 mA).\nVarious structures such as fuel tanks, space residences etc.\ncan be fabricated from the self-healing polymeric materials\ndescribed above by molding, welding of flat panels or otherwise. Fuel tanks fabricated from the various self-healing\n50\npolymers must, of course exhibit resistance to contained fuels\nor other contained materials. For example, while SURLYN\xc2\xae\nexhibits superior self-healing properties, it demonstrates very\nlittle compatibility with conventional fuels. The TONES\npolymers and the synthesized polyester materials described\n55\nabove exhibit excellent resistance to conventional fuels while\nalso exhibiting good self-healing properties.\nThere have thus been described a series of polyester materials that offer self-healing properties as well as formed struc60 tures of commercial and newly synthesized polymeric materials that exhibit self-healing properties when penetrated by a\nbullet or similar high velocity projectile.\nAs the invention has been described, it will be apparent to\nthose skilled in the art that the same may be varied in many\n65 ways without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.
