The piezoelectric\ncoefficient is around 500 pm/V which is higher than\nother high temperature piezoelectrics with similar\npiezoelectric coefficients. The piezoelectric\ncoefficient is close to that of soft PZTs but has much\nhigher operating temperature (i.e. ~150\xc2\xb0C for PZT)\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 These new piezoelectrics do not depole up to their\n400oC. The electromechanical properties are large\nin comparison to other piezoelectrics that have\nsimilar electrical hardness. The coercive field is\naround 20kV/cm at room temperature. The\nhysteresis loops are square and single crystal like\nindicating a high level of domain stability upon\nremoval of electric field. The remnant polarization\nis near 50mC/cm2, a value that is extremely high.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 A provisional patent application has been submitted\n\nField induced polarization and strain for composition in BiScO3Bi(Zn1/2Zr1/2)O3-PbTiO3 system. Bipolar (left) behavior shows large\nremnant polarization and coercive field. Unipolar (right) behavior\nshows large high field piezoelectric coefficient.\n\nElectromechanical coefficients (left) as a function of temperature\nshow a depoling temperature of 400oC.
