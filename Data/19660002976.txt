Those systemswhich are designed to operate in the earth\'s\nshadow must incoroora_e some form of energy storage or an alternate source of energy.\nPrevious s_.udieshave shown that a cavity type of receiver is most suitable for a solar\nabsorber, and thermal energy storage is readily adapted to cavity receivers.\nIn this case, excess energy must be supplied during the sun time to melt the storage\nmaterial. Thus, the concentrated energy must be absorbed by the storage material and\nheat transferred continuously From the storage material to the working fluid. During the\nshade time, the storage material freezes as energy is removed continuously by the cooler\nworking fluid. These alternate processesof melting and freezing the storage salt occur\nduring each typical orbital cycle. Because of the alternate melting and freezing, the\nstorage materln! seldom, if ever, reaches ;toady-state operating conditions. Since the\nstorage material is operating under transient conditions most of the time, design informc_ion must be obtained to properly reflect the transient nature of the s_orage bath.\nIn the previous work on the Sunflower program a_ reported in Reference 1, the transient\nheat input and heat release design parameters were determined experimentally. Analog\npredictions of the heat release performance were made and compared with the experimental results. The experiments confirmed the basic validity of the heat release analog.\nIn the present program, NASA requested analytical predictions of the heat input performance and experimental verification tk.ereof. In addition, analog predictions of the\nheat release performance and similar experiments were to be made to reconfirm the validity\nof the analog method. Also, a literature search by NASA and TRW personnel failed to\nuncover thermal conductivity data near tl,e melting point for lithium fluoride.\nIn view of\nthe lack of data, determinations of the thermal conductivity of lithium fluoride for both\nthe solid and the liquid near the melting point were specified. This information is vital\nin the prediction of the fluoride thermal resistances.\n\ni\n!\n_\n\nThe major purpose of this program is the design of a full scale flightweight cavity receiver\nto NASA specifications. The resulting design is to employ the transient information obtained on the heat transfer characteristics of lithium fluoride to the fullest extent possible.\nWhen the work effort on this program began in July, 1963, a gas pressuredrop allowance\n\n_\n\' J\n\nequal to four percent of the inlet pressure was permitted. Subsequent studies indicated\nthat this pressure drop allowance could be reduced to two percent of the inlet pressure\nwithout seriously affecting the design of the cavity receiver. The s_cificatlons were\nthen revised to include this improvement. The initial and revised specifications are\npresented in Sections 2. I and 2.2 of this reporb respectively.\n\n_!\n_\'\n:\n\nThis report presentsthe results of the cavity receiver !_sign study conducted under\nContract NA$ 3-2779 and includes the work specified in the original contract (Task I)\nand Amendments4 and 6.\n\n3\n,\n\ni\n\n_4\n\':_\'\n.\n\nI\n\nii\n\nii iiii\n\niii\n\ni iiii\n\nII\n\n[\n2. i\n\nInitial Specifications\n\nNominal values of the argon Brayton cycle state point: and flow rates are as follows:\nTemperature at receiver inlet - 1446\xc2\xb0R\nTemperature at receiver outlet - 1950\xc2\xb0R\nPressureat receiver inlet - 13.72 psia\nPressureat receiver exit - 13.17 psia\nFlow rate for 30 ft diameter collector - 36.7 Ib/min\nFlow rate for 20 ft diameter collector - 14.7 Ib/min\nThe above values are subject to ,,ariation as the cycle analyses and design studies progress.\n2.2\n\nRevisedSpecifications\n\ni\n\n"jheanalysesand design efforts required herein shall be performed for a receiver/heat\nstorageunit suitable for usewith a 30-foot diameter collector orbiting at 300 nautical\nmiles.\n?\n\nThe nominal applicable values of the argon Brayton cycle state points and systemspeclflcations to be employed are as follows:\n\n\'\n\nReceiver inlet temperature - 1446 R\n\xc2\xb0\nReceiver exit temperature - 1950\xc2\xb0 R\nReceiver inlet pressure- 13.72 psia\nTotal _P (inlet to exit flange) - O.275 psla (2%)\nArgon flow rate - 36.7 Ib/min\nTotal shadetime capacity - 38 minutes\nSun time (ecliptic) - 60 minutes(300 n. mi.) per orbit\nSun time (all-_un) - 96 minutes per orbit\nDesign life - 10, 000 hours\nThe solar collector characteristic _ to be employed in the cavity temperaturedistribution\nanalysis are specified by the contract as thosepredicted for the 30-foot aluminum honeycombmirror studied L:nderConh\'act NAS 3-2789.

The wall-to-gas temperature difference\nratio, Atw/_tc f for a given designwill vary with orbital time from 0 at the time when\nthe fluoride is al] l_quld to somefinite ratio at the time when the fluoride is all solid.\nFigure 1 indicates that /_tg/At m increaseswith increasing gas side temperature difference and increasingwall-to-gas temperature difference ratio. The exact _tg/_t m\nrequired for a given design cannot be predicted directly.\nThe variation of the factor KL with gas side temperature difference is presented in Figure 2\nfor several pressure\ndrop ratios. It cab be observed that the factor KL increaseswith increasing gasside temperature difference and permissiblepressuredrop ratio.

The similar\nvariation of the minimumtube projected area with the factor KT (turbulent flow) is presented\nin Figure 5 for several levels of/ktg//.._t m. Each level of Atg/_t m representsa d;fferent\nheat exchange requirement, of course. The desirability of operating at the higher values of\nKL or KT is clearly evident in these two figures. However, the power conversion system\nrequirements and considerationsdictate the maximum level of the factor K allowed.\nFurthermore, the entire pressurecJrop\nallowed may not be available for the tube design.\nThissituation is particularly true in multl-tube designswherein pressurelossesoccur in the\ninlet and exit manifolds. These lossesdecrease the value of A p to be assignedto the\ntubing and applied in the calculation of the factor K.\n\nL\n\nIn the preliminary analysis, it was demonstratedthat the tube projected area varies with\nthe gas Reynoldsnumberas illustrated in Figure 6. This variation is for given values of\nthe factor K and /_tg/Atm in turbulent flow. The tube projected area required increa_e_\nwit;, :\'_creaslnggas Reynoldsnu-ber. Although not presented herein, the increase of tube\nprojected area with gas Reynoldsnumber is even more pronounced in laminar flow. Thus,\na conclusion may be drawn that it is desirable to operate at as low a gas Reynoldsnumber\nas possible. This conclusion must be limited to designsbasedon the gas correlations\npreviously discussed.\nThe variation of the tube dimensions, D and !., and the tube number, N, with gas Reynolds\nnumberfo_a particular case in turbulent flow is given in F.:gure7. The decrease in tube\nnumberand increase:in tube diameter and length with increasing gas i_eynoldsnumber is\ntypical for both laminar and turbulent flow. Figure 6 hasalready indicated that operation\nshould be at \'., low gas Reynoldsnumberwith an attendant high tube number.\n\n:;\n;\n\n;_\n\nThe next question of ie.terest in the preliminary analysis was which region the heater should\nbe designedfor - laminar or turbulent? To answer this o_e graphically, the variations\nwith gas Reynoldsnumber were calculated for each region and placed on a common graph.\nThe resultsare shownin Figure 8 for _tc/_tm=\n2.75 and AP/P 1 = 0.022. It can be\nobserved from Figure 8 that heaters deslg_ed for bare tubes in laminar flow require larger\nnumbersof tubeswhich a_e shorter and sr..aller in diameter than heaters designed for bare\ntubes in turbulent flow. The tube projected area required is approximately equivalent,\nbut a slight advantage is available at low Reynoldsnumbersin laminar flow. The pa:kaglng\n\n1\n\'\ni\n\nproblem becomessevere, if not prohibitive, with the large numberof tubes (4000 -\'_ 8000)\nrequired at the low laminar Reynoldsnumbers. After reviewing the magnitude of the packaging\n\n!\n\nproblem, it was decided to designfor operation in turbulent flow.\n\nI\n\n|\n\nThe next item of potential controversy was the use or non-use of ilns attached to the tubes.\nThe fins can be potentially attached to either the inner or the outer surface. In either case,\nthe useof fins mustbe based upon a definite requirement to lower the thermal resistance\ninvolved. The possible use o_ flns attached to the outer tube surface was consideredfirst.\n\nRt = Rg + R + RF\nw\n!j\n\nIt was shownin Reference 3 that the total thermal resistonce to heat flow is:\n12\n\n.I\n\nI\n--\n\nVARIATION OF THE MINIMUM TUBE PROJECTEDAREA WITH\nTHE FACTOR K FOR TURBULENTFLOW IN CIRCULAR TUBES\n\n5O\n\nt\n\n\': -:\n\n[\n\nAt g\n\n- 3.50\n\nA i"m\n40\n\n[\n_\n\n"\n\n\'\n\n,\n2O\n\n\'\n"_\n\n_\n\ni\n-\'\n\nt_\n\n10\n\n0 -4\n\nI\n\na\n\n6\n\n8\n\n109\n\n2\n\n4\n\nFACTORrKL\n\nFIGURE 4\n\n.i\n\nI\n\nVARIATION OF THE MINIMUM TUBE PROJECTEDAREA WITH\nTHE FACTOR K FOR TURBULENTFLOW IN CIRCULAR TUBES\n6O\n\n"\n\nI\n__\n\nt\n"---E\'g\nZ_tm\n\nI\n\nI\n\n_I\n\n5O\n1_1\n\n4o\n\n3.50\n\n\\,\n\n\\\\\n., 30---._--\xe2\x80\xa2,\\_\n\n0\n\n\',\n\n_\n_\n\n6__\n2.4\n\ni_"\n\n\'\'\n\n6\n\n8\n\n1011\n\n2\n\nFIGURE 5\n\n\'i\n,\n\n6\n\n8\n\n!012\n\n\'\n\nFACTORI KT\n\n. :\n\n_\n\n4\n\n14\n\nii\nI\n\nI\nI\n\ni\n\n!\n\nVARIATION OF THE TUBE PROJECTEDAREA WITH\n\nI\n\nNUMBER AT A CONSTANT K FACTOR LEVEL\n42\n\nl\n\n,\n\nI\n\nK = 3.06 x 10"\ntg /k tm\n\n3.50\n\n38\n\n_\n\n"\n\n34\n\ni!\n\n30 ,f\n\nJ\n\ni\n\n_\n\n26\n\n!\n22\n\n,,,\nBOO0\n\n12, 000\n\n16, 000\n\n20, 000\n\n24, 000\n\n28, 000\n\nREYNOLDS NUMBER, Re\n\ni1\n\nFIGURE 6\n\nil\n\n"\n\nI\n!\n\nJ\n\nTYPICAL RESULT FOR HEATERTUBE PARAMETERS\nS\nWITH TURBULENT FLOW IN CIRCULAR TUBES\n\n_\xc2\xb0\'\xc2\xb0l\n\nI\n\nI\n\nK T = 3.84 x 10"\nAtg\n\nA,r.- 350\n\nj\n\n1\n\n/ /\n\n,/\n\n/\nLENGTH (FT x 10-] )\n,,\n\n1.0\n\n_k\n\n/,\n\n.\n\n/\n\n/\n\n/\n\n/\n_\n\n-\n\n/\n\n_\n\n,"\n\n-\n\n_I_M_T_\ncl_._\n\n/\n\n_\n\n/\n\nNUMBER\n(Nx1o-_\n\n!\n\n1\n_)\n:\n\no\n\n1o3\n\nI\n\n_1\n\n]o\n4\nREYNOLDS NUMBER, Re\n\n._\n\n\';\n\n16\n\nFIGURE 7\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n!\n\nL\n\n\xc2\xb0\n\nfor the classical ccse of a multi-walled cyl!nder immersedin an infinite bath.\nconditions, the heat flow per unit length of tube is:\n\nO/L-Each\n\nof\n\nthe\n\nRg -\n\nUnder these\n\nR\nt\n\nresistance\n\nelements\n\nare\n\nlisted\n\nbelow:\n\n1\n_\'ffr i h\n\nR =\n1\nw\n2 711" w\nk\n\nIn rO\nri\n\n1\nRf = 2 "K kf\n\nIn rm\nro\n\nIn Reference 3, an estimate of the value for the solid thermal conductivity of lithium\nfluoride was obtained from Reference 4. The value employed was 1.5 Btu/hr-ft/\xc2\xb0 F.\nAt the time, no known experimental data were available. Since that time, experimental\nvalueswere obtained as a part of this programand were published in Reference 5. The;\xc2\xa2\n\n__t\n\nexperimentsare discussed Section 4.1. The average experimental value of 5. 1 Btu/\nin\nHr-Ft-\xc2\xb0 F is about three times the original estimate but would not alter the conclusions\nreached on external f;ns.\n\nl\n\nThe level of the fluoride resistancedependson the amount of fluoride frozen around the\ntube. When the fluoride is complete!y molten, the resistance of the solid is zero. As the\nan.aunt of frozen _luoride increases, the radius to the melt line increasesand the fluoride\nthermal resistanceincreasestoo. The fluoride resistance reaches a maximumwhen ell of\nthe fluoride is frozen. Two potential designswe.recalculated for Reference 3 and the\nresultsare presented in Figure 9. It can be observedfrom Figure 9 that in both cases the\nfluoride resistancewas lessthan the gas-side resistance at all times. Since the experimental value of .\'he solid fluoride thermal conductivity is higher than the original estimate,\nthe revised fluoride resistancewould be even lower than that shownin Figure 9. Since\nthe gas thermal resistanceis larger than the fluoride thermal resistance at all times, the\ngas thermal resistanceis rate-controlling at all times. On the basisof the results in\nFigure 9, there is no need to lower the fluoride thermal resi._tanceby adding fins on the\nexternal surfaceof the tubes.

The advisability of using internal\nfins was investigated. Internal fins contribute to additional gas pressuredrof, and comp!icate\nthe fabrication process. The most difficult part in the manufacturing processis th_ procurement, or production, of the correct type of internally finned tubing. It is not readily available commercially and could necessitate a fabrication development program.\nFlow analysis of the desirability for internally finned tubes was based on the amount of heat\ntransferred per unit of pressuredrop. It was demonstrated that the amount of heat transferred\nper unit of pressuredrop was a maximumwith bare tubes and lower with internally finned\ntubes. In view of this result, the pressuredrop limitation which is very important to the\noverall systemand the fabrication problemsinherent in internally finned tubes indicated\nthat every effort should be made to use base tubes if possible. The analytical results that\n\n;\n\ni\n-\n\nthe heat transfer per unit of pressuredrop is a maximum with a bare tube was confirmed in\nthe exper!ments of Reference6.\n\n-\n\n_\n\nThe potential use of a large number of tubes as required by a design operating at a low\nReynolds number in the laminar region has been mentioned previously. The worst problem\nwith this approach is the packaging difficulty.\nIn addition, the overall fabrication problem\ni_ significant when one considerswelding over 1000 tubes into inlet and outlet tube sheets.\nThese general physical and practical mechanical limitations preclude the use of large numbers\nof tubes in a cavity receiver. Therefore, a small number of tubes was considered desirabie\nand operation in turbulent flow indicated.\n\n!\n\nFinally, fins can be attached to the cavity surface to promoteheat transfer between the\ncavity surface and the lithium fluoride to reduce the thermal resistance between the cavity\nsurface and the lithium fluoride, and thus to reduce the temperature difference between\nthe cavity surface and the lithium fluoride melt line for a given heat transfer flux level.\nIt is well known and understoodthat all formsof extended surface can reduce the thermal\n\n,\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nresistance. In general, any of the various forms of extended surface can be employed for\nthis purpose, but each of them complicates the fabrication of the inner shell ana the\nsubsequentassemblyof the basic container. Therefore, for the sake of simplicity and\nreliab.:lity ir design and assembly, it is desirable to avoid the complication of fins attached\nto the inner shell. If the resulting surface temperature is higher than the material of cons_ucfion can safely withstand, it becomesobvious that someform of extended surface must\nbe employed to reduce the surface temperaturesrequired for melting the fluoride. At the\ntime of the preliminary analysis, no definite information was available on which to base\na final decision. Hence, the approach was to proceed on the optimistic hope that fins\nwould not be required. Subsequentevents discussedin Section 4. 2 indicated that the\n\ni"\n\ninitial units will require fins until zero-g test resultsindicate otherwise.\nThe above discussioncompletes the\n\ngeneralized preliminary design analysis.\n\n]\nThe\n\nI\n\nnext\n\npreliminary and fllghtweight designstages.\n\n1\n\n2O\nit\n\nsection presentsthe important gasand lithium fluoride property data employed in both the\n\nI\n\n!\nI\n3.2\nI\n\nArgon and Lithium Fluoride PropertyValues\n\n3.2.1\n\nArgon Properties\n\nTemperatureRange:\n\xc2\xb0\nSource: Reference 7 1400 R to 2000\xc2\xb0 R\n\nj\n\nl\n\n3.2.1.1\n\nSpecific Heat\nCp = O. 1242 BTU/I.b-\xc2\xb0 R\n\n3.2. 1.2\n\nSpecific Heat Ratio\n\nCp = 1.667\n\nii\n\n3.2. 1.3\n\n1\n\nGas Constant\nR = 38. 7 ft-lb/Ib -\xc2\xb0 R\n\nJ\n3.2.1.4\n\nViscosity\n\n[\nI\nl\n\nVariable, per Figure 10\n3.2. 1.5\n\nThermal Conductivity\nVariable, per Figure 11\n\nt\n\n!\n\n3.2. 1.6\n\n_\n!\nt\nl\n\ni\nii\n\nPrandtl Number\nPr = 3600 Cp\n\nk\n3.2.2\n3.2.2. 1\n\nLithium Fluoride Properties\n\n"t\n\nMelting Temperature\nSource: References8 and 9\n\n"-\n\ntm = 848\xc2\xb0C -+ 1\xc2\xb0 (1560\xc2\xb0F -+1"8\xc2\xb0)\n\n21\n\n_!"_-_\n\'\n\nr\n\nr\n\nVISCOSITYOF ARGON\n\nSOURCE: NBSCIRCULAR\n564\n\nT\n\nI\nI\nI\nI\n\nTHERMAL\nCONDUCTIVITY OF ARGON\nSOURCE: NBS- CIRCULAR\n564\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nI\nI\n2.8\n\n!1\n\nI\n\nx 2.6\n\nJ\n\nLI-\n\no\n\nJ\n\n-r-\n\nI\n\n\xc2\xb0\n\n""2.4\n\n-\n\nj\n\nZ\n\ni\n\n_\n\n2.2\n\nj\n1400\n\ni.,-\n\nf\n\n1500\n\n2.0\n1600\n\n1700\n\n1800\n\n1900\n\n2000\n\nTEMPERATURE\n(\xc2\xb0R)\n\nFIGURE11\n\n23\n\nI\n!\n\n_,_:_\n\n_..j_\n\n3.2.2.2\n\nHeat of Fusion\nSource: References 8 and 9\nhf = 6.470 kcal/MOLE (449 Btu/Lb)\nNote:\n\n3.2.2.3\n\nBoth References 8 and 9 lean heavily on Reference 10 for\nthis type of data.\n\nHeat Content\nSource: Reference 9\nVariable, per Figure 12\n\n3.2.2.4\n\nDensity\nSolid - Source: Reference 8\n/Oss = 2.63905 _+ O001gm/cm3 (25\xc2\xb0C)\nO.\nLiquid - Source: Reference 8\n/o e = 1.789 gm/cm3 (870\xc2\xb0C")\n\n:\n\n_e\n\n!\n\n= 2.201 - 0.000474 t gm/cm3 (887\xc2\xb0 _\n\n1058\xc2\xb0C)\n\n!\n\nLiquid - Source: Reference \'11\n/o e =\n\n1.729+5x10-4(1000t)\nwhere t is in degrees centigrade.\n\nI,\n\nValues selected by TRW are shown in Figure 13.\n_.\n\n3.2.2.5\n\nAdditional Data\nReference 8 is reproduced in its entir\',,ty including its bibliography.\n\ni\n_i\n_\n\n3.3\nCavity Configuration Studies\nIn addition to the various possibilities on tube design and heater operation, several shapes\nwere consideredas potential candidatesfor the cavity surface and storage bath ,:ontalner.\n\n_\n\nthe major shapesinvestigated were the hemisphere, cone and reflections, was not seriously\nThe inverted cone with an internal conical section for multiplecylinder.

The _estassembly was designed to handle the heat\ninput and hea, release tests primarily. It was essentially similar to the lithium hydride tests\non the Sunflower program, as reported in Reference 1 and was not specifically designedfor\n\n37\n\ni\n\n_\n\n_"\n\nthermal conductivity measurements. A cutawcy v_ew _sshown in Figure 17. As can be\nobserved from Figure !7, the test bed consisted essentially of the test module mounted\nbelow a ciuartz-tube radiant heater. A coolant chamber was installed beneath the test\nmodule. A sheet of 1/4-inch thick Min-K insulation was placed beneath the test module\nand the coolant chamber Io provide more uniform heat removal. The heater-modulecoolant chamber assembly was covered wlth one inch of MIn-K insulation. * This assembly\nwas placed on a Marinite* support structure. The outside container was constructed of\n1-inch thick Marlnlte, which itself is a type o_ insulation. The void between th- heatermodule- coolant chamber assembly was filled with Perllte which is a bulk insulation. Thus,\nthe test bed consisted essentially of insulation surrounding the heater-module-coolant\nchamber assembly.\n\nm_\n\nThe layout for the thermal conductivity module is illustrated in Figure 18. The dlmensions\nwere selected based on an anticipated value of thermal conductivity on the order of 1.5\nBtu/Hr-Ft -\xc2\xb0 F. The thermocouple instrumentation throughout the test module can be observed in Figure 18. Additional thermocol:ples were installed at varlcus places throughout\nthe test bed to determlne the temperatures at these Iocatlons. These addltlonal readings\nwere needed to estimate the heat lossesto various ports of _he rest bed.\n\n:\n\nThe test rig schematic is presented in Figure 19. The coo!ant alr was supplled by a plantwlde system. The incomlng alr was filtered, regulated and measured. The flow rate was\ndetermln_d by two methods - through an orifice and a rotameter. The flow control valve\nwas located between the orifice and the rotameier. From the rotameter, tte air went\ndirectly io the co_lant chamber and then vented to atmosphere. The air pressure was\nmea._uredat the regulator and the rotameter, and the orifice pressure difference was obtained\nfrom a water manometer reading. The air temperature was measured at the inlet and outlet\nof the coolant chamber.\n\n!\n\nThe electrical schematic is also included in Figure 19. Heater power was controlled by\nvariacs. Voltmeter, ammeter and wc_ttrneter readlngs were obtained. All low temperature\nreadlngs were obtained with iron-consrantan thermocoup_es and recorded by a 24-point\n0-800 \xc2\xb0F Honeywell temperature recorder.

The vacuum attained was in the 20 m_cron range at room\ntemperature. The vacuum pump continued to operate during heating, but the vacuum\nlevel increased to the high micron range, 300 to 500. These actions were generally\ntrue of all modules tested.\n\n_,\n\nWhen ;t wasascertained that the systemwas acceptably fighb heating was initiated.\nDuring the first heat, the fluoride was completely melted and maintained molten for\nseveral hoursin an effort to remove any additional corrosive vapos not previously\nremoved. The tempera_res of the molten fluoride bath and the test bed were stabilized\nwithout any coolant f!ow. The heater power req Jired under these conditions was that\nneeded to overceme lossesfrom the module to the test bed and out the heater reflector.\nAt the concJuslonof the initial test run, the heatel _ower was shut off and coolant flow\ninitiated to assist in freezing the fluoride. It was desired to leave the fluoride in a\nfro_:en condition at the end of the day. The initial set of runswere made with n_ coolant\nflow and included several runswith the fluoride mo_t_nand severa! with the fluoride\nsolid a_ temperaturesjust below the me]tlng temperature, in each instance, the temperatures of alJ parts were stabilized and the total heat los.:esobtained from the heater power\nrequired. It was planned to apply these values on the IrJter runsto estimate the heat transferred to the fluoride.\nThe second set of runs concentrated on obtaining data for the liquid fluoride at temperatures\njust above the melting temperature. Care was taken during these runsto make certain that\nall of the fluoride was molten. This fact was indicated when the thermocouples located in\nthe bottom plate of the module were recording 1560\xc2\xb0F cr above. Inltlally, the molten\ncondition is easier to verify than the frozen condition, and thus, the liquid thermal conducfivlty was investigated first. Many runs were made in an effort to obtain reproduclbl_\'\nresu\'ts. In each case_ all bath temperatureswere held stable w, thin I\xc2\xb0F for one hour for\na test to be considered valid and data taken.\n,\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThe third set of runswere intended to determine the data for the solid fluoride at temperatures\njust below the melting temperature. Again, care was taker, to make certain that all of the\nfluoride was solid. This could be assured with the thermocouples located in the top plate oi\nthe module recording 1560\xc2\xb0F or below and heat flowing. Several runs were made to obtain\nrepeatable data. The same temperature stability criterion of 1\xc2\xb0 F per hour was employed in\nthese runs to consider the data valid and sultable for recording.\n4. i.3\n\ni\n\nData Evaluation and Analysls\n\nThe major objective in the data reduction processwas to provide flux data for the measured\nthermal gradients. The thermal conductivity was evaluated on the basisof its definition:\n\nQ/A\n\n:,_:\nJ\n|\n!1\n\nThe _emperaturesof the two rows of therm_;o, Jples immersed_n the lithium fluoride bath\nwer_ recorded during all valid runs. Since the distance between the two rows was fixed\naur[ng fabrication, the temperature gradient was readily calculated as the temperature\ndifference divided by the distance between the rows. The temperature pattern was\ninvestigated at each of the two rows for unlform_ty and to determine if any gradients\nexisted. It was found that the temperatures were remarkably unlform_ but slight gradients\ndid exist Fromthe central portion to the o\'Jter walls. Continuec_examination of the data\nrevealed a central region in which no loteral temperature gradients existed. The central\nregion so defined was then employed as the area in the above equation, and the temperature gradient was calculated on _he bo_is of the values in the central regions. The\nremaining outer portions of the both in which lateral temperature gradients were indlcatlve\nof lateral heat losses\nwet.? considered as a type of guard heaters. Normally, in thermJI\nconductivity measurements, guard heaters would be employed to preventundesirable heat\n\nI\n\nlossesnormal to the direction of heat transfer.\n\nI\n\nDuring the thermal conduct;vlty runs, it was observed that the measured temperature differvery\nences were\nlow at low hearer powers. To reduce the potential error in the temperature\ngradient, the heater powers were increased to :he high end of the available range for all\nof the valid run,_. Attempts were made to calculate the heat flow through the fluoride by\n\nI\n\nsubtracting the measurerlsteady-state heat lossesobtained in the first set of runs from the\nheater powersettings in the valid rl, ns. As a check on the results, the heat flow through\nthe fluoride was calculated by the addition of known, or measured, heat !"-es. These\n\nl\n\n"=\n\nincluded the heat removed by the coolant and the heat lost to the s_des\nand conducted\ndown to bottom of _he module. Sufficient a_sembly irjstrumentatlon was available to make\ndirect calculations of these quantities. The results demonstrated t_at the former method\nwere\ndid not provide heat flow values that\ncom._afible and consistent with the rest of the\ndata. The latter method, however, did provide consistent and compatible results; hence,\nthe latter method was employed to evaluate the heat flow to the fluoride. The total heat\nflow to the fluoride was calculated as the sumof the heat removed by the coolant plus\none-half of the side lossesminus the heat conducted down the sides. Since the central\nregion received only a part of the total heat flow tc the fluorlde, its heat flow was\non c_ straight percentage\ncalculated\nof the total heat flow. This method of calculating\nthe heat flow in the central region contributed to the overall potential error.\n\nI\n\nIn the following error analysi._\nerror was not included.\n\nconducted\n\nForone of\n\n]\nQbath =\n\nx\n\nLiF\n\nQbath = Qalr + 1/2 Qloss - Qcond.\n\n_\xc2\xb0\n\n45\n\nthe solid\n\nruns,\n\nthe\n\nabove\n\npossible\n\nSince Qbath _ Qalr, the mejor errors in evaluati\'ng the heat ;\'low late occur in the heat\ntransfer to the ,_r flew.

The coolant flow\nat the bottom plate of the module was held constant througho:Jt the test.\n\n:\n-"\n\ni\n\'\nt\n!\n\nExperimental P,ocedure\n\nIt was desired to be certain that all of the fluoride was frozen before the heaters were\nturned on. Therefore, the bath temperatures were allowed to go below 15500F and the\ntop plate temperatures followed. On some occaslons, the top plate temperatures went\nas low as 1400\xc2\xb0F before the heaters were turned on. In any event, it was necessc-y that\nall of the fluoride be frozen for the sequenceto be valid. When the heat=rs were turned\non, the rate was set at a constant value and malntalned until all of the fluoride was melted.\nAgaln, temperctureswere permitted to overshoot to be certain that the fluoride was\ncompletely m_,l_en.\n\n,\n\nSeveral cycles of alternate freezing and melting were completedat each of three heater\npower settlngs, 2000, 2500,and 3000 watts.

The tlme required to\nfreeze all the fluoride was taken as the time from heater shutoff to the polnt when all both\nand module temperatureswere below 1560\xc2\xb0F. The time to melt was taken as the time from\nheater power start _ the polnt when selected thermocouples, No. 15 and 16, which were\nlocated on the bott_m plate, read 1560\xc2\xb0F or above. The top plate temoeraturesat the\ntlme defined as the end of meltlng were recorded and an average temperaturedeterr.llned\nfor the four cenhally !ocated thermocouples. This average temperaturewas then defined\nas the top plate temperature at the end of melting.

The thermocoupi_s were thus 3/8-inch above the surface exposed to the\nfluoride.\nThe thermocouple positien above the surface exposed to the fluorlde left open\nthe possibillty that i\'he thick top plate might have a transient temperature through it at\nthe end of meltlr,g. Under these conditions, it could be possible for the surface exposed\nto the fluoride to be at a significantly lower temperature than the thermocouple read.:ng.\nConsequently, G translent temperature analysis for the top plate was made uslng a convent_o,,al Schmldl* plot. The results of the transient analysis indicated that by the tlme\nthe fluoride is approaching the all-molten condltlon, the tap plate temperature gradient\nis essentially that corresponding to the steady-state condition.

Therefore, no correction was\napplied to the thermocouple data to make the temperatures equlvalent to the bottom surface\ntemperaturesof the i_p plate.

The t,"o dummy modules were tested solely to demonstrate the capability to obtain a controlled freeze pattern. The test module was placed\non its side by rotating the test fixture. The test plan called for the fluoride transfer tube\nto be at the top. The plates normclly deslgncted as top and bottom plates were _na vertical\nposition during _-hefreezing process.

In this position, a large amount of free volume was available for\nthe liquid fluoride to settle. On freezing, insufficient quantities of fluoride remained in\nthe vicinity of the tubes and the test results were meaningless to point out the importance\nof keeping I the rtransfer tube at the top.

The module was cut open for visual\nexamination. The cut was made so that the module could be reassembled if the results of\nthe visual examlnctlon were unfavorable. Fortunately, the results of the visual examination\nwere very favorable and it was concluded that a method of obtaining the desired controlled\nfreeze pattern had been successfully demonstrated.

SCALE FLIGHTWEIGHT RECEIVERDESIGN STUDJES\n\na\nW_S\nThe first major effort in the full s_:aJe\nfJightwelght receiver design studies\nto evolve\nconcept design layout to meet the requirements of the initial receiver specifications as\ngiven in Section 2.1. As a pad" of this effort, _t was necessary to examine in some detail\nthe possible trade-offs between multlple-tube designs with inlet and outlet manifolds and\ndesigns with one to ten tubes which might conceivably eliminate the need for these mani=\nfolds. Receiver designs were examined for various gas oressure drops allowable in the\nreceiver of prime _nterest - one designed for tile nom;nal 300 nautical mile circular\necliptic orbit in comb!nation with a 30-ft diameter r;gid collector.\nReceivers were also\nstudied for several other operating conditions which included a 300 mile orbit with a\n20-ft diameter collector and the synchronous orbit for both the 20-ft and 30-ft diameter\ncol lectors.\nBasedon the parametric studies for the various allowable gas pressure drops, it was decided\nto perform a second major effort to evolve a concept design layout based on the revised\nspecifications of Section 2.2. A series of problems were en:auntered which had to be\novercome. These problem areas included operation at low gas Reynolds numbers with tube\ncurvature required, in_dequacy of the usual correlation- employed and the influences of\ninert gas mixtures replacing the organ gas specified. To circumvent these problems, two\nconcept design layou_ were developed. The first one provides gas operation in turbulent\nflow and is adequate for hellum-xenon mixtures with molec\'4ar weights near forty. The\nsecond one features gas operation in laminar f!ow with internally finned tubes. The latter\ndesign is intended fer use with argon gas as specified in Section 2.2.\n\n--\n\nAll of the receiver designs were to be considered to operate in an all sun orbit as well as\nthe usual sun-shade orbits. Thus, some r.ethod of cavity over-temperature control must be\nprovided. In addition, the use of aperture closure devices was to be investigated to obtain\n_\'hemaximum cavity energy retention. If the aperture were closed during the shade time\noperation, the cavity radiation Josses\nduring the shade Hme would be minimized. Thus,\nthe maximum amount of energy would remain in the fluoride storage bath for transfer to the\ngas working fluid.\nThe flightwelgh_- full scale concept,\'design studies are descrlbed in the following order:\n1.\n\nStudiesfor the 2 per cent gas pressuredrop design with He-Xe mixtures.\n\n3.\n5. 1\n\nStudies for the 4 per cent gas pressuredrop design.\n\n2.\n\n,\n\nStudies for the 2 per cent gas pressuredrop design with argon gas.\n\nFour Per Cent Gas PressureDrop Design\n\nAfter the hemisphere had been selected as the optimum cavity and container shape for this\napplication,\n\nthe prime effort was directed toward providing a design with fewer tubes to\n\n-_\n\n,\n>\n\n.,\n\' _!i\n\nimprove rellability.\nIn conjunction with this ef.%rt, preliminary deslgns wer_ determined\nfor other cavity r_.ceivers of interest ro NASA. The specifications for the other cavity\nreceivers are included in Table Vh\nIn addition to the preliminary design for the various cavity receivers, use of a small tube\nnumber, up to 10 tubes, was investigated to determine if elimination of the inlet and oL, let\nt\nmanifolds was possible, practical and advan:ageous.\nIn the invesrigation of the use of a small numberof tubes, a set:as of calculations was made\nfor a gas allowable pressuredrop of 0.50 psi compared to a _tal , -!owable of 0.55 psi for\nthe four per cent design. Several calculations were m_de for designs at 0.45 psi and qne\neach at 0.25 psl and 0.75 psi. The resultsof the ral_ulatlons _ 0.25, 0.45 and 0.75 psl\nall confirmed the resu;_ at 0.50 psi. Therefore,., fly the 0.5C psi resultsare presented,\nbut the trendsare typlcal of all the others. Thr _\'h\'st\nitem of interest is the tube inside\ndiameter required for each of the tube configur\n"ns. The variation oE the tube h D. wlJh\nnumberof tubes is shownin Figure 49, a,ld the\niffple _\'be deslgn point is illustrated for\ncomparison. It can be observed from Figure 49 t at _be bun:\'l- : wlth less than five tubes\nrequire tube dlameters greater than two inches. Even w_tk ,\n"3es a diameter of almost\n1.4 inches is needed. These dimensionscompare wlth the 0.68_-inch diameter specified\nfor _e 50-.tube design. The tube diameter influences the annular thickness needed in the\nstorage bath. The larger diameters obvlously required larger annull. The larger annull\nintroduce more difficulties in the melting of the storage mate,ia|, and this characteristic\nis considereda disadvantage.\n\n\\\n\nA second item of interest is the heater tube surface area needed for each tube configuration.\nThls variation is given in Figure 50 with the multlple-tube point included. It can be\nobservedfrom Figure 50 that the heater surface area required decreaseswith tube number\nfrom one to ten tubes. At ten tubes the area needed is within one square foot of the multiple\ntube designarea, but inlet and outlet manifolds may be required. In practice, it would be\nnecessaryto have transition pieces at least and these might require a sllght pressuredrop\nallowance. In any case, it is be;; ;red that a configuration with ten tubes is definitely\nmarglnal wltl regard to elimination of headers.\n_"\n_"\nZ\n\nThe third item of interest is the tube projected area required.\n\nThe projected area is\n\nnumerically equal to the surface area divided by the constant "/1". Thus, the vori_stlon\nshownin Figure 51 for the tube proiected ar,:a is similar to that given in Figure 50.\nHowever, the tube projected area has added significance in that it is the mlnlmum possible\n\n1\n"1 r\n\ncavlty surfuce area for any given configuration. Additional surface area must be provided\nfor the storage salt. The added area for the salt could be held relatively constant_ but the\ncavlty surface areas for the low tube numbers\nwould become quite large and resui_ in a\nsignificant increase in collector blockage. The alternative is to limit the added area for\nthe salt, but this procedure requl,es extended surface with its attendant complications.\nr\n\n\'\n\n.1\n\n_1\n\n,!\n\nAfter reviewing the results of this investigation, it was concluded that the use of a very few\nnumber of tubes, in the range from one to five, held llttl....._e\no_no.promise for better packaglng.\n\n|\n92\n\nVARIATION OF TUBE INSIDE DIAMETER WITH NUMBER OF TUBES\n\nE\n\n,\n\n4.5\n\nI\n4.0\n\nI\n\n_\nLL\'\n\n__\n3.0\n\n_\n\nJ\n\nt--\n\n|\n\n/\n\nr_\n\n2.5\n\nt\n\n| ,,,\ne\n\n!\n\nAp = 0.50 PSI\n\n"\'\n\n\\\n\n1\n\nm\nZ\n\nI\ni\n\n,,,\n\xe2\x80\xa2"\n\nr\n\n2.0\n\ni\n\nD\n\n\\\n\n"-\n\n1.5 --L---\n\n]\nI\n\nL\n,.o-___\n\nI\n\n0.5\n\n1\n-\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n--5-.\nI\n1\n4\n\n_K\xc2\xb0_\xc2\xb0\'_\'\n\nl\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n,:_\n_\n\n11\n\n48\n\n49\n\n\'\n\n50\n\n51\n\n52\n\nNUMBER OF TUBES\n\n93\n\n_\'--\n\nFIGURE 49\n\n._i,\n_,..,\n?\n_,\n/,\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n"\n\nII\n\nI\n\nVARIATION OF HEATERTUBE SURFACEAREA\nREQUIRED WITH NUMBER OF TUBES\n\n90\n\n85\n\nvAj\n\nV7\'\n\nI\nI\n\nVARIATION OF TUBE PROJECTEDAREA REQUIRED\n\nI\n\nWITH NUMBER OF TUBES\n\nl\n\nb\n\n!\nL\n\n23\n\n---\n\n"_\n\n22\n\n_.\nt\n\n_,\n\n,,.\n<\n\nP = O.50 PSI\n\nILl\n\n_- 20\nU\n\n\'\n\n\\\n\no.\n\n\\\n18\n\n......\n\n!7\nZ_P = 0.30 PS\n\n1\n\n16.\n\n,\n\n.\n\nNUMBER OF TUBES\n" :I\n\n95\nII\n\n_\nFIGLIRE 51\n\n\'\n\n.....\n\nt\n\nIn the range from five to ten, the characterlstlcs looked more promlslng_ but some compro-.\nmlses in header design might be needed.

Therefore, laminar flow operation, where the pressure drop per unit of heat transfer is less, wa_ investigated. The\npossibility of not only turbolators but also internal fins was considered in the laminar flow\ncase. A limited study of the .ootenfial for both turbolators and internal fins _ndlcated that\nthe advantage of th. latter was far greater, and the investigation of designs with internal\nfins continued. Dr. Eckert and his associates at the Unlversi_ of Minnesota have published\na number of papers on laminar flow in various shapesof ducts. References 27, 28, 29 and\n30 are a few of the papers involved. The last reference above was considered the most\nsuitable for the type of internal fins contemplated for this design. Two extreme conditions\nare noted therein, one in which the wall temperature is constanf and the other in which the\nheat flux is constant. The conditions in the tube sector and two fins are not exactly constant\nwall temperature, but they are closer to constant wall temperature than to constant flux.\nThis situation is fortunate, for the latter condition can exhibit an order of magnitude less\nheat transfer than the constant wall temperature case. The correlation for the constant\nwall temperature case was employed in the design optimization procedure. This approach\ncan be justified on the basis of the low temperature drop in the fins caused by the low gas\nheat transfer coefficients.\nThe design concept evolved for the two percent allowable argon pressuredrop is illustrated\nin Figure 60. This concept features the samecavity and receiver diametersas the turbulent\nflow design in Figure 58. The inlet and outlet header designsare also similar.

The effects of tube curvature in stabilizing the gas flow and use of recent\nturbulent heat transf_.r correlations _n the design analysis indicated that the turbulent flow\ndesignswere marginal even with the insertion of turbolators.

This blockage is in addition to the receiver shadowing.\nLater estimates by NASA may show that a total blockage of 6 percent for the structure\nplus 3 percent for the receiver is greater than the system needs. In that case, both the\ntotal energy and the local flux would increase since the computer program results are\nlisted as I/Io/O ns where I is tile incident flux, Io is the solar constanb ._ is the collector\nreflectivlt 7 and ns is one minusthe fractional structural blockage, or 0.94 in this case.\nThe value of the above ratio is set by the computer program results, but it is apparent that\nan increase in the denom;nator will increase the numerator also.\nAn analysis of the flux distribution shown in Figures 61, 62 and 63 was conducted to achieve\na physical understandingof the results. The incident flux dlstribution for the perfectly\noriented case, Figure 61, was as antlclpated.\nIn the case of the 1/4 degree misorientatlon,\nFigure 62_ radlal slices were taken on both halves of the major ax!s in the direction of\nmlsorlentation and on one half of the minor axis. The ,_\',u^\ndistribution was known to be\nsymmetrlc about the major axis. It can be observed from Figure 62 that the incldent flux\nover mostof the cavity surface is almost independent of the direction of the radial slice.\nIt is only at the open end (low values of cosine g) and at the dome end where significant\ndifferences occur. Study of this resul_ led to a modification of the computer program for\nthis case. The modification simplified the cavi|y portion of the program by reduclng it to\na symmetrical flux dlstrlbutlon as in the perfectly oriented case.\n\n!\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n_\n\n:\n\n\',\n1\n\nExamlnation of F:gure 63 revealed another result which had not be_-nfully anticipated.\nit can be observed from Figure 63 that the radial flux distributions for the two halves of"\nthe major axis are significantly lower than that for the minor axls. In Figure 62 the major\naxis dlstributlon achieved the highest energy level as expected. Thus, the question about\nthe Figure 63 immediately arose as to what had caused this apparent change. It was\npostulated that the shift was caused by the fixed aperture. Further, a cavity with a larger\n\ni\ni\n!\n\nfixed aperturewas made For the more normal flux distrlbutlon similar a 10-1nch 62.

It can be observed from Figure 64 that the\npeak levels For the major axis distributions cre higher than in Figure 63 and are more nea ly\nnormal, or what would be expected. These results illustrate clearly the fact that orientation\nerrors greater than the aperture design value should be avoided. Not only is the energy\nlevel wlthln the cevity reduced under the condi_i,_\'.r:sf Figure 63, but consldercble energy\no\nis directed on the outside of the aperture cone where provisio__\nn.sfor heat dissipation must\nbe made.\n\n.:\n\n6.2\n\nCavity Radiati.;n Solutions\n\nThe cavity radiation Flux and the resultant surface temperature distrlbuHon were solved\nbased on the method presented in Reference 15. The declsion ._oemploy this method rather\nthan that of Reference 1 was based on the ability to adapt the approach of Reference 15\nmore rec_dily to "h_ cases of misorlentation.\nIn Refersnce 15, the temperature distribution\nwas assumedand the resultant flux calculated.\nIn lk.:s case, however, neither the temperature distribution nor the radlant flux can be assumed. In addition, the heat absorbed by\nthe wall and transferred to the fluoride must be evaluated. (The fluoride resistance to heat\nt\n\nflow is a variable and is described in Section 6.3.2.)\nThus, the surface temperatures can\nbe expected to be varlable and the distribution could change also.\n\nJ\n\nAnother term was add_.d to the cavity flux equations presented in Reference 15 to account\nfor the heat transferred from the wall to the fluorlde.

A voltage potential is applled between the source and sink, and\nlines of constant potential, corresponding to isotherms, can be identified.\nWith knowledge\nof location of an isotherm relative to the melt llne, the position of the melt llne at some\nlater time can be determined because it can be shown that the distance which the melt\nline moves is inversely proportional to the local distance from the melt line to the isotherm.\nSeveral melt line positions were determined as illustrated in Figures 41 and 65. At each\nmelt llne position, the electrical resistance from the melt llne to the tube wall and the\namount o_ lithium fluoride frozen were measured. The electrical resistance can be readily\nconverted to a geometrical resistance factor. The results are shown in Figure 43.\nThe final freeze pattern and lithium fluoride volume distribution of solid and llquld provlde\nthe starting point for the e_ectric analog simulation of heat addition through the inr.er\nshell, corresponding to the sun portion of the orbit.\nThe procedure for determining the resistance during melting is presented next.\n6.3.2\n\nFluoride Resistance Durlng Melting\n\nThe basic procedure for each of the electric analogs representing the melting process is\nessentially the same as that durlng freezing in that isotherms are located in both the Iiquld\nand the solid. These isotherms are taken as close as possible to the melt llne to improve\nthe accuracy. Again, the local movement of the melt llne is inversely proportional to\nthe local distance between the melt ilne and the isotherm. A: shown in Appendix B of\nReference 1, the local distance, _ , is proportional to\n\nq[_\'S\n1\n1 1\nwhere qL/qS is the ratio of the heat flow through the liquld to the heat flow through the\nsolid and _ L and _S are the local distances between the melt line and the liquid\nisotherm and the melt line and the solld isotherm, respectlvely.\nThe heat ratio is -:\nvariable, of course, and is equivalent to\nkL\n\n_\n_J\n\n_TL\n\n_\n\nSince the thermal conductivity in the llquld and the solid are known constants, the varlabillty\nenters in the temperature difference ratio. The temperature difference in each instance is between the melt line and the isotherm.\n\nA series of analogs was constructed to determlnethls slmulatlon motion with sun time at each\nof two tube locations. It was hoped to perform the melt line at additional tube locations,\nbut time and funding restrictions prevented this.\n\n\'!\n\n131\n\n_;\n\n,\n\n........\n\niii\n\n,\n\ni\n\nH, i|1\n\nr-\n\n"_\n\nni\n\nElf\n\nI_\n\nu.;\n\n,1\n_\n\n132\ni\nJ\n\nI\nI\n\nThe melt line motions obtained on the analogs indicated that the melt line approaches the\ntube rapidly. As the melt line touches the tube, the simulation discussed above breaks\nan\ndown because the local distance between the melt llne and the tube, which is\n_sotherm,\nis zero. Therefore, a new technique was required.\n\nI\n\nthe tube\nThe new technique is based on the fact that the local gas temperature within\nis\nmuch lower than the melt llne temperature. Tkus, even though a section of the tube wall\nreaches the melt llne temperature and the lithium Fluoride solid resistance is zero, the gas\n\nI\n\nI\n\nfilm resistance is still effective and controls the rate of heat transfer at the local tube\nsection.

Once the equal potential lines have been defined: the local\nmovement of the melt llne was obtained by methods similar to the determlnation of the\nresistance during freezing.\n\nj!\n\nThe results obtained for the two tube sectlons are shown in Figures 67 and 68.

The fluoride resistance is determined from Figure 68. Tube sections\n4 throL;gh 7 employed the variation shown for section 6. Tube sectic_ns1, 2, 3 and 8\nthrough 22 employed the variation shewn for tube section 1. For each section the level\nwas determined by the starting value, which was the resistance at the end of the shade\ntime. The fluoride thermal resi._.\'_r_ce numerically equal to the geometrical resistance\nis\nfactor divided by the thermal conductivity of the solid.\n\n_\'_\n\nThe gas thermal resistance is the reciprocal of "7I"D h. The heat transfer coefficient was\ncalculated from the :orrelatlon taken from Reference 21 as described in Section 5.2. The\nsum of the two thermal resistances is taken as the total thermal resistance. The heat exchanger per unit of tube length is the temoerature,difference between the melt line and\nthe gas divided by the total thermal resistance.\nIn the caseswhere the melt line touc_es part of the tube, _e h_cal heat transfer for that\npart of the t_.be is basedon ._e g_ thermal resistanceonly sinc_ the resi_tunce of the\n_oJidfluoride is zero. The mecsurementsfor tube sections 1 and 6 indicated that the\nvariation of the tube angle touched by the melt line increased with the amount of fluoride\napproximately linearly, lherefore, a linear variation was employed. For tube section 1,\nthe melt line touched the tube at 15 percent melted.

Again, the fluoride\nres_:t_l,ce is numerically equal to the geometric resistance divided by the solid thermal congas thermal resistance. The resistance is the sumof tube length thermal resistance and the\nductivlty. The total therma_heat transfer per unit of the fluoride is the temperature difference between the melt llne and the gas divided by the total thermal resistance.\n\nI\n\nThe results obtained for the shade time are shown in Figures 69 and 70. Figure 69 gives the\ngastemperature variation along the tube with shade time, and Figure 70 gives a similar\n\n"_\n\'\n\nvariaticn for the gos pressure.\nOne item of interest was noted in the results for the shade time calculations. The amount\nof lithium fluoride available for tube sections 4_ 5, 6 and 7 was less than that required to\noperate for 36 minutes. (Refer to Table XII in Appendix.)\nIf the 30-tube turbulent\nflow designwas intended for fabrication, the annular s_cing in the vicinity of these tube\nsections would be increased to provide space for the additional fluoride volu,\'ne required.\nNo changes were made since this design is not scheduled to be fabricated.\nA typical heat flux variation with tube length during shade time is presented in Figure 71.\n6.6\n\nSun Time Results\n\nThe solution for the solar flux distribution on the cavity surface produced results shownin\nFigure 72.for the perfectly oriented collector.

It can be observed that some sections of the tube near the inlet\nare at lower levels in the sun time than in the shade time. This situation is caused by\ninsufficient heat coming front the cavity, in this region. Gas temperature _nd pressure\ndistributions along the tube are presented in Figures 78 and 79 for the case of Figure 73.\nThe tube wall temperature is also shown in Figure 78.

B_causeof the\ncomplexity of the twe-dimensional heat flow involving varying geometry (expansi\'n of\nlithium fluoride while undergoing change of phase), only eight lithium fluoride sections\nperpendicular to the plates were used and the entire heat capaclty of each sectlon was\nconsidered to be concentrated in the center line between two fins.

The basic shell thicknesses were set at 0.050 in. (minimum). Locallzed\nsections to 0.080 in. are recommendedat the critical shell-header junctions to decrease\ndiscontinuity stresses. The required minimumthickness dimensionfor the upper header\ncould be given in termsof a,1 equivalent O. 25 in. thick cylindrical cup.\n\n7\n\nIt is proposed that the gas manifold (relnforced or otherwise) would serve asa suspenslon\nrlng for the cavlty receiver. The suspens!on\nmounting ;ing has not been designed to date\nas this ring is NASA\'s responsibility. This also would determine the required minimum\nthickness for the lower header. Basically, this manifold-header combination serving as\n\n\'\n,\n\ni\n\nthe suspenslanring would help to suppress\nthe transfer of sometake-off and thermal Ioad_\nfrom the structural suspensionelements into the primary shell structure.\nThe subseq\'sentlow cycle Fatigue ( _-"10, 000 thermal cycles) and long li.Ceconsiderations\n(10_000 hoursat 1560\xc2\xb0 F to 1750\xc2\xb0 F) indicate :hat these severe loading requirements could\nbe sat;stied by proper material selection and shuctural optir_izatlon.\n\n:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n_;\n\nFor this structural design two pertinent quantities were considered; namely, the LarsonMiller parameterand correspondingstress rupture strengths, and the permissiblealternating\nstressintensity. Insufficient information on material properties for the requlred operational\ncondltiGnspr_;cludeda confident evaluation of the candidate materials: Haynes 25, Waspaloy\nand Hastelloy. Basedon the subsequentextTapolatlons_ Waspaioy appears to be the leading\ncandidate material for this structural application.

Adding a safety factor to this figure, a 50 psia\nlimit was chosen. The detail design provesthis to be a reasonable value.\nUsinga 50 psla limit left a choice between NaK (78) and sodium,NoK (78) was picked\nbecauseof its higher Z_P and also because it is a liquid at room temperature.\n\nT\n\nJ.\nair\n\n8.9.4\n\nTemperatureControl\n\nI\n\nThe temperature control systemwill consistof four rectangular openings to allow reradiafion\nto space. The total open area is set at 346 in. 2. Each opening is covered by two doors\nwhich can be opened by one of two setsof bellows. When the temperature of the sensing\nbulbs reaches the requffed temperature (1680\xc2\xb0 F), the door will start to open. Ar 1720 F\n\xc2\xb0\nthe NaK (78) vapor pressurewill be high enough to pressurizethe bellows so they will\nexpand enoughto swing the doors 15 to their full open position.\n\xc2\xb0\n\nI\n\nSince lubrication and self welding is a problem, no sliding or rubbing contact was allowed\nin this design. The doorsrotate on flex pivots where only bending occurs. The bellows\ndisplacement is trans.%fredto the doors through thin flexing metal arms. Since rotation\nand displacementswere kept small, bending stress is within allowable limits.\n\n_\n\nT\n.L\n\nThe manufacturing tolerances of the spring systemare compensatedfor by adjusting the\ncomoresslon the calibration spring. A 20% adjustmentwas designed into the system.\non\nA torsionspring is usedto keep a preload on the closed doors and to close the doorsduring\ncool down process.\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n_\n_\n\nThe bellows will be madeof 316 SSwhi,:h is not only a good bellows material but also is\nnot attacked by the NaK (78). In order to keep the spring relaxation rate below 2%, the\nsprings will be madefrom Inconel X wire (No. 1 temper).

The lower part of\nthe form is di\',i, t into five columns.\nThe first column -- Fa!iure Mode -- is used to record the passible ways in which the\nparticular part could rail.\nThe secondcolumn -- Class-- is for entering the classification of the failure:\nMinor; MA = Major; CR= Critical.\n\ncode MI =\n\nThe thlrd column -- Detection Method -- is used to record the nature of that occurrence\nwhich gives an indication of the malfunction or the failure.\n\n297\n\n!\n\n_ _"\n\nJ\n\nT\n\nThe fourth column -- Compensationor Control -- is used by Rellability personnel to record\ntheir corrective recommendations.\n\n-\n\nThe fifth column -- Effect on Next Higher Assembly-- states the effect upon and the\nextent to which a next higher _ssemblycould be affected.\nAs a result of this initial failure made and effects analysis the following\ndesignated for further surveiila:lce.\n\nproblem areas are\n_"\n\n(a) The designof the shade and hec_tregulating door assemblies\nThis statement pertains tc the mechanical structure of the bellows, the\nlinkage, the hinges, and to the other components such as the sensors.\n(b)\n\nThe materials and mater_al thickness\nThis pertains to structural stength and to fabrication.\n\n(c)\n\nFabrication\nl\n\nThis pertains to forming and welding.\n\n!\n\nA more complete failure mode analysis will be performedwhen final (R&D) drawings become\navai lable.\n\ni\n!\n\no\n\no\n\n298\'\n\n!\n-\n\n"....\n\n|\n\nW\n\n"\n\nI\n\nI\n\xe2\x80\xa2 |\n\n,o\nI\n\nI\n\n++\n\no\n,--\n\nX\n\n0,--\n\nCO ,--\n\nGO O0 O\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0.1\n\n,.-: "_d_,_.,+,,+,,+.,,+_\nP\n\nI\n\n+l\n_.\xc2\xb0",0\n\n0\',\n\nd-\n\n1\n\nc,,,\n\n_++I" "\xc2\xb0\xc2\xb0\'+\'\xc2\xb0\xc2\xb0+\n\xc2\xb0\nZ\n\nd _I\n\n+\n\n+\n++\n\ni\n\nZ\n\n._[ .--+ -+,,++ _ + m_ +-+,+\n\n+,\n+\n\n.I_\nc-\n\n_,\n\n+\n\n.I_\nC\n\nua;\n\n0 Lu\n-"\n_-_\n\nO!\n\nua\n\n,v.\n\nX\n\n.+ +. +-P+_\xc2\xb0 o0\n"\'\n,_ ,_0,\n_\'\n\n++\n,+\n\n,,o\n\n,o\n\nE\n\n_&&\xc2\xae\ncm\'_E\'+\'o o\n\n\'+0\n\no\n\n\xc2\xae E o\n_.- _ o+--_\n&"o _ ,-\n\n."=\n._\n\n\xc2\xae\n\ni,\nT\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 _,,o\n\n\'_\n\na\n\xc2\xae ,\'-\n\n_\n\n0)...o + i .I_ .I_ "\n\n++ = oo o o__+\n=m=++,_+\no\n+..\n\n+..-,_\n\nIJ..l\n\n=z\n""_ _a\n\n,,\n.a\n\n,,\n_\n\n"0\n\n,,_\n\n<\n\nuJ\n\n,,\n\nII\n\n+\n,-\n\n+\',0\n\n_\n\n_D\n\n,o\n"\n\n_-r\n\nx\n\no,-,--_\n,-: ,.z_ c; ,-- c;\n\n0\n\n+,\n\nI\n\nem\n\ni|\n\nU\n\n"\n\n._ _\n"-\n\n,,\xc3\x97\n\n._,>:\n\nd\n\new\n\no, _\n,A\n\n_\nx\n\n_._,\n\n+_\n_\n\no\n,\nII\n\no.o_\n\n+\n+\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xc2\xae\n\n_\n\n_:\n\nil\n\n_\n\n_ -: _-+.+ o\n+m...0+\n\n_.\n\n+\n+\n\no\n+\n\n,,+\n+\n\n299\n\n,_\':_\n\n+,,\n1\n\nI\np\n\n.\n\nI p+\n-\'\n\ni|\n\nt\n\nz_\n;::).,.\xc2\xa3\n\n5_\n..=.\n\n0\n\n>"\'\n"_\n\n_\n\n_\no\n\n"-o\n\n..._i\n\n...,.I\n\n_ li\n\nf\n\no\n\no\n\n_, _\n"\'\n\nI\n.\n\n._\n\n_J\n\n_-\n\nG) \'_"\n\nz\n\na\n\n1[\ne"\n\n_\n\n"\xc2\xae\n\n_\n\nr;.o._\nu--\n\n_\n\n_\n\n\xc2\xb0\n\nE _\n__1 _._o_\no \xc2\xae ,., ,-, ._0,..6\n\n_\n\nZ\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n_6\n\ngll,- _\n\xc3\x97\n_11\n\n"\'\n\no\n\n_ _._\n\n_ \xc2\xa2-) (3\n\n"-.\n\n<\nZ\n\n_\xc2\xae$\'-\'-\n\n=\'\n\n:_\n3\n\n_o\xc2\xa3\n_ a_o_\n\n.-- >\n\n-o\n\n>\n\n....\n\n.....\no_\'\n\n0\n\n-_\n\n_it\n\n>\n\n>\n\nc-\n\nI\n._.\n\n,o\n\no o,Z_._ _\n_._ o-_\'\n\n-o\n\n__\n\n!i\n\n._8\n\n_\'o\n\n.:.. ,,_\n0 \'-,,D 0\n\no\nu\n--\n\nz\n\n|\n\n-o "-\n\n\'\n\n_\n\n-_\n\n_\n\n.._ ,,.,\n0 \'-,,0\n\n}-"\n___\n\nI\n\noo_=\n_ _-"a\n\n.-\n\nc _\n\n"I-\n\n"o o_ o\n\nU\n"10\n0\n\nuJ\nr_\n\n!\n\n"E_\n\n._\n\n>-\n\n,\n\nI\nI\n\n_\n\nl\n\n302\n\nj\n\n,.-h\nx ,.,-,\n\nI\n\n0 <\n\no\n\n_\n\n_ _\n\nP o\n\n"\'_\n\n_\n\ni\nu\n\na\n\n$\n0\n\n_E\n<\n\n--\n\n\xc2\xb0_ i\n\ni\n\nN\n\nO.\n\n.l-\n\n(-\n\n--\n\n__E\n_E8\n\n8\n\n_, 5\n\n=-\n\n_"\n_ ,,z,\n\n-\n\n-\n\n__\n\n::03\n\n..,_\n\n!I\nx_\n\nU-r-\n\n"\n\no\n\n_\n\nE E\n\nlli JJ\n\n_\n\nc\n._\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2_\n\ne-_-\',-\n\nu.\xe2\x80\xa26-\n\nj\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\ni\n\n_\'\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n.u_\n__E_\n\nU\n\nom\n\nE\n\n|\n\n>.\xc2\xae_\n.;.moo\n__l 0 o_ ar\nu--\n\nT\nJL\n\n. o\n\n0 >,_\n--\n\n"- ."
