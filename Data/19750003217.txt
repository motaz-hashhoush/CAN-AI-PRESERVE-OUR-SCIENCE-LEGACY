b'PRECISE TIME AND TIME INTERVAL DATA HANDLING\nAND REDUCTiON\nL. C. Fieher\n\nU S. Naval Observatory\n.\nABSTRACT\nIn the past year, the increase in PTTI data to be reduced to the U. S. Naval\nObservatory Master Clock and the requirement for ita quick dissemination has\nnecessitated development of more efficient methods of data handling and reduction, An outline of the data involved and of the Time Service computerization\nof these functions i s presented.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nDuring the past several years, the instrumentation and operation of many systems which could be used for world-wide synchronization have\'been di3c~ssed.\nAmong them have been Omega, Loran-C and Loran-D, television compa.isons,\nand the Defense Satellite Communication systems. Implicit in all of these systems used for timing i s that someone, somewhere is receiving data and giving\nsome feedback to the participating stations. It is the mechanSrs of this role of\nthe U. S. Naval Observatory Time Service which I plan to discuss this afternoon.\nWith the rapid development of timing systems, the increase in data input to the\nTime Service has been tremendous. However, there has not been a corresponding\nincrease in personnel to process the data manually. Because of this fact, in\nMarch 1973 it was decided to inaugurate automatic data processing for Precise\nTime and Time Interval data as much a s possible.\nAs all data from the Defense Satellite Communication terminals were already\nbeing received in machine-readable form, i.e., paper tape via TWX, this system was used as the nucleus for the design and implementation of a program to\nstore, calculate and disseminate all PTTI data.\n\nFORMAT\nAs the first step in this program, a standard format for TWX transmissions\nwas devised. What was desired, a t the minimum, was a format which the IBM\n1800 Automatic Data Acquisition System could use to distinguish PTTI data from\nall other incoming TWX messages and yet which would be flexible.\n\nPRECEDING PAGE BLANK NOT FILMED\n\n215\n\nA d d i t i d requirements were the Day, Month, and Year;the local reference o r\nCesium number; the identification of the monitored syatteme; the time comparison; a check number; and the date/time of the comparieon (Fig. 1).\n\nThe addition of \'NOTESwgave flexibility to the format in that m y comments\nand/or quetstlons could be trancrmitted, in any form, in the same message.\nFrom inception, the computer processing was envisianed as hading all incoming\nPTTI data. The next figure is of two messages received from the Camp Roberts,\nCalifornia and Futenma, Okinawa Satellite Communication (SATCOM)\nterminais.\nThey have transmitted a time transfer via satellite, a direct time comparison,\n9nd readings of Loran-D and Loran-C, reepectively (Fig. 2).\nTo identify the TWX message as PTTI data, four Y\'s followed by the location\nand activity, must be on line 1 Line 2 is for the date, line 3 is the local ce.\nsiums and the following lines contain the monitored egstexns. In the message\nfrom Camp Roberfs, each of the Cesiume were wed: Cs.576 for Loran-D and\nCs 550 for a time transfer with Kwajalein, Marshall Islands. Cs 576 is also\nused in time transfers with Ft. Dix, New Jersey axxi Brandywine, Maryland.\n\nIn addition to the SATCOM telnninals which a r e transmitting data in this format,\nme such stations as Nasa/Guam; Detachment wCharlieww the Naval Astronautics\nof\nGroup in Hawaii; and Elmendorf Air Force Base in Akeka (Fig. 3).\n\nY T LOCP.TTON/REPOP\'?\'TNC\nD.2V FONT)!

S, Naval Observatory IBM 360/40 general purpose computer. The data\npunched a r e the civil date, the computed Modified Julian Date, "Local Reference\nor Cesium Numbertt, and the time compariean. The check number, which i s\ntwice the time comparison, i s automatically verified. Any discrepancy is noted\non the typewriter as an error.\n\nSTORAGE AND REDUCTION\nThe punched cards a r e then used a s input to the IBM 360/40. All permanent\nstorage and all calculations a r e done here because of the greater capacity and\nC ~xibility data manipulation. Since only SATCOM time transfers, direct comin\nparisons and some television comparisons are used in this system currently\n(although expansion is being planned) only the data used are stored on the disk\npack. The calculations to reduce all the data to the difference U. S, Naval Observatory Master Clock (USMO MC)-Local Reference o r Monitored system a r e\nthen made.\n\nIn Figure 4, we can see not only the links o r series of additions necessary to\nreduce the data to USNO M but also the worldwide precise time synchronization\nC\npossible through the SATCOM terminals.\nThe connecting link between all terminals and the USNO M is the terminal at\nC\nBrandywine, Maryland (coded MBWE). To ensure that its relationship to USNO\nM is well known, portable clock visits a r e scheduled, at a minimum, bimonthly.\nC\nAdditional data are provided by a microwave link which i s read Monday through\nFriday.\nTiming access to the Pacific i s possible through the Honolulu terminal (HHON/\nHHEL) (Fig. 4). Through this path, precise time reference stations have been\nestablished at Guam and Okinawa. After modifications to the equipment at\nThailand (SSEA) a r e completed, a precise time reference station will also be\npossible there. If a station can be established at either Northwest Cape (ACAP)\nor Woomera (WOOM!, Australia an important link will have been established for\nthe control of the Naval Communication Station, NWC.\n\nA s seen in Figure 4, the Northwest Pacific Loran-C chain (SS3)is monitored by\nOkinawa, Nasa/Guam, and SATCOM/Guam. Such redundancy can provide great\nreliability to the ;eported values of SS3.\n\nThrough the Camp Roberta terminal (CRBT) (Fig. 5), links t Kwajalein,\no\n\nMarsball Islands; tentatively to Woomera, Australia; and to Shemya, Alaska\na r e pocrsible. With a link to Shemya a d by portable clock vieite to Elmendorf\nAir Force Base, the Northern Pacific Loran-C chain (SH7) which i s monitored\nby Elmendorf, can be relatad to USMO ?AC.\nIn the East, eynchronization t USNO MC is also provided by the SATCOM tero\nminals: golng from Brandywine through Ft. Dix, New Jersey to Norfolk, Virginia\nand then to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Another path is through Ft. Dix to Naples,\nItaly or to Landstuhl, Germany where equipment modifications a r e now being\nmade.\n\nThe method and equipment used in time transfers between SATCCM terminals\nhave been di8cwsed at past PTTI meeting8 (PTTIPlanning Meetings, 1971 and\n1972).\nOUTPUT: LISTINGS AND GRAPHS\nThe daily output of this program a r e six pages of computer listings. The first\nt o are a summary of the data reduced to USNO MC. While beginning and ending\nw\ndates a r e variable, the usual liet is for the current month with about an eight-day\nwer-lap. The reminder o the listings contain all the raw data received. Using\nf\nthe lists (Fig. fi), dbcontinuities and/or discrepancies are located and problems\nresolved when possible. If necessary, clarification from the terminals i s requeeted, The problem most often encountered is the transmission of the wrong\nem.\nOn the\n\nsummary sheets (Fig. 7), the difference of USNO MC-Local Reference\nor Monitored System is given as well as the calculated rate of change in parte\nin 10 l 3 in respect to USNO MC,\nOn goal is to keep the cesiums within k10 microseconds and also wlth a rate of\nchange of lees than k12.0 parts in 10 l 3 in respect to USNO MC. From the following plots, using data etored on disk, the steps made in controlling the cesiums\nat the SATCOM terminale may be eeen.\n\nIn the graph of Norfolk, Virginia/Cs 351 (Fig, 8), the measurements obtained in\nlate July and early August gave a time difference USNO MC-VNOR/CS 351 first\nof -9.8 microseconds and then of -12.0 microeeconds. A control message,\nbased on these time differences, was sent requesting a 15 microsecond retard.\nImmediately after the step, frequent data were received which gave a rate of\n-15.9 x 10\'" f o r Ce 351 in reepect to the USNO MC. Therefore, a second control message to decrease the frequency was sent. Since then (September lo),\nCe 351 has remained within 1 microsecond of USNO MC.\n\nWOOM-WOOMERA AVSf\nKWAJ-KWAJALEIN MI.\nS f -LORAN-0\nASHM-SHEYMA M A S K ) :\n\nAMSQ-ELMENOOCZF MB ALASCA\nSH7-NORlHERN MCIFK LOlUHC\n\nFigure 5\n\n"\n\n1\n\nJ\n\nI\n\n\'\n\nI\n\n--\n\nU\nI\n\n-\n\nI\n\nI\nP\n\na\n\nREgRoDUCIslUrY OF THE\nOmGWfi PAGL I8 POOR\n\n&\n\nI\n\nC\nt\n\n. . .

The first message initiated the step. To do tbis, it was neeeseary to change the thumbwheel settings which control tbe amount of delay in\nthe qmtem. Since tBN0 MC-Cs 351 was negative, we wished b retard it or,\nin other words, t increase the delay in increasing the thumbwheel settings. In\no\neach Control Mesqge sent, the USNO gives the current thumbwheel setting d\nthen the new setMng we desire. Each unit change is equivalent to 1 mic~~~ecand.\nAfter the change is made, an acknowledgement is sent by the SATCOM terminal,\ngiving the old setting, the new one, and the date/time of the change.\n\nIn like manner, a change in frequency is introduced. Here, the change is accomplished by adjusting the C-field setting of the cesium beam. S h e the rate\nof change in USNO MC-Cs 351 was negative, we h e w that the frequency of Cs\n351 was high in respect to USNO MC. We therefore decreased the C-field setting, each unit cbaage in the setting being approximately equal to a change in\nfrequency of 5.0 parts in loi3,\nIn contrast to the ease in which Cs 351 was controlled, the graph of USNO MCGMOG/Cs 529 (Fig. ll), shows the worst case in that a number of corrections\nwere necessary to b r h q Cs 529 (located in Guam) into the tolerances desired.\n\nThe first time comparison was made by portable clock visit in April 1973. The\ndifference %-asbetter tban 40 microseconds and the frequency was quite low as\nindicated by subsequent data from time transfers made with the Honoluh terminal. The frequency rate of change with respect to the USNO MC was 4 5 . 7 x\n10-l3\n\n.\n\nA Control Message to advance by 50 microseconds and to increase the frequency\nby a number of major divisions was sent. No C-Beld setting was specified as\nit was not known at that time. Unfortunately, the frequency was changed by too\ngreat an amount. Additional messages were sent and since September 1, the\ndifference USNO MC-GMOG/Cs 529 has been less than 1microsecond.\nAs an example of the best case is the plot of USNO MC-OFUT/Cs 447 at Okinawa\n(Fig. 12). After an unexplained jump of approximately 6.0 microseconds in midFebruary, Cs 447 has been very stable. Its rate of change in respect to the\nUSNO MC, over 234 days, has been -2.9 parts in 10\nThe two poltable clock\nmeasures made in April and October gave riae to an unexplained discrepancy of\napproximately +0.4 microseconds in the sense SATCOM time transfer-Portable\nClock measurement. This difference, appearing also in the comparison of measurements made a t Guam and Thailand, has not however appeared in any other\ncomparisons of SATCOM time transfers and portable clock measurements. The\ndiscrepancy is still being discussed and will be investigated further.\n\n\'\\\n\nTIME\nTO:\n\nSEFXRENCE STATION\n\n.\n\'b NAYCOHMSTA\n\nNOiiFQIK VA\n\nBT\n\nUNCUSS\n//No~&~Q//\nADJUSTHENT OF VMOB/CS 331\n1, INCREASE THUPSWEEL SE\'t"!\'Tw FE Q?Q 387\nCK 1 840 766 TC 02n 398 CK 1 P l O 796.\nR"Q DATS/TIME A DJltFTWENT PESQOPHED.\n2,\n\nm\n\n*\n\n---\n\n.\n\n-\n\n- ---\n\n---.---\n\n-\n\nFigure 9.

WINKLER:\nThantt you, Ms. Fisher.\n\n~\n\no\n\nn forsthe paper, please ?\n\nENS WHITE:\n\nIe the obeervatorg\'s current position t assume the kind of clock control that\no\ny m demonstrated for the SATCOM teterminale and t extend it t other organizao\no\ntiow ? Say, mntrol over a cesium that we might have at one of our s i b ?\nA r e you in a position t assume the control of that in terms of adjustments and\no\none thing and another.\nMS. FISHER:\n\nI would defer that t Dr. W i d e r .\no\nDR. WINKLER:\nI cannot commit ourselvee without knowing exactly the situation, and I would like\nto invite you for a diecuesfon on that. The poseibility e x l a , technically, because the ey~tc?m designed a s developed by M8. Fisher to handle 30 messages\nis\na day o r 100 meseagee a day. It doeen\'t make any difference in that regard.\n\nThe greatest problemdl which exist are in training; sign convention, for inutanoe,\ni s a major headache for u . It does require a coneiderable amount of training.\ns\nI think we have to at least initially take into account the human interfaoe. That\nis why we appreciate having 80 many actually operating people here in the\naudience, so we can get into mme direct oantact.\nI think after that has been ertablished, after we have wllected considerable\n\nexperience, we will have a very smoothly running sy8tem.\nThere is another queetion.\nMS. FISHER:\nI would also like to mention that any kind of analymis of error on any of there\ntranaferr L not Wne into yet. We are only ertablirhiag the qrtem. It h\nw\nonly been started since March of 1973, and it ir j u t now being done by the\n\nmmguter.\n\nRight now, we are just trying to get a data set, something to work with. I think\nin the three graphs that you did see, tho time transfers do indicate a great deal\nof coneietency, and you can extrapolate and predict these valueu for some time\nahead.\nQuestion, please ?\n\nMR. MITCHELL:\nTom Mitchell, Kwajalein Missile Range.\nIn regard to the sign convention which Dr. Winkler mentioned, when we first\nstarted out we weren\'t sure of our sign convention, and possibly we had some\nerrors.\nMy primary question here concerns the first reading that I sent in, This was\n73 microseconds, which we disagreed with, and we did not change. How, to this\ndate we have not been able to determine where the 73 microsecond reading came\nin. However, it was a consistent reading, but because of the magnitude we were\nable to determine that it was a bad reading.\nShould the reading be of a lower magnitude, and we get consistent readings like\nthat, how would we determine whether we have had a jump in our clock, o r\nwhether there is a mistake in the reading that we are getting.\nMS. FISHER:\nWell, the procedure we would like to follow is to contact the terminal itself and\nask for another time transfer just to confirm it. In your case, we did not have\nany readings at all from Kwajalein before that first one. It was so far off, that\nwe sent a control message right away.\nNow, again, here, if I recall, you immediately made another time transfer with\nCamp Roberts that showed that the first reading was in error. Why that would\noccur, 1don\'t know. Perhaps somebody more involved in the equipment,\ninvolved in time transfers could tell you that.\nDR. WINKLER:\n\nAgain, let me remind you also that the quickest way to find out i s to look at\nanother time eoupce, e,g, Loran o r send a portable clock, and we a r e left again\nto our main meane to calibrate the validity of the overall procedure. W e cannot\nbe entirely without i t.\n\nMS. FISHER:\nI think thore is going to be another paper later on about the Defense Satellite\n\nCommunications scheduling, in preciee time transfers. The system will be\nvery good, world wide, but we 20 have the problems of scheduling, and the\nprecise time transfers a r e very low priority, unfortunately.\nDR. WINKLER:\n\nThere is another comment that 1 want to interject here, and that is, a t the\npresent time there a r e roughly 28 satellite ground stations which a r e o r will be\navailable. Out of these 28, DCA, and the services have approved 10 designated\nstations to serve, in addition to their regular use a s precise time reference\nstations.\na\nSome of these 10 designated ~ t a t i o n e r e Camp Roberts, Hawaii, Okinawa,\nGam, and there kit1 be others.\nHowever, since it i s an operational system which utilizes in a piggy-back way a\ncommunications system, a gigantic communication system, we must preserve\nthe utmost flexibility.\nBut we will be in a position to serve, to provide time service wherever the\naction is, -because that i s where the terminal is going to be.\n\nMS. FISHER:\nAny more ,,uestions?\nMR. MITCHELL:\n\nYes.\nIn the remote location that Kv~ajalein in, and our mail service is rather poor\nis\nout there\n\n--\n\nDR. WINKLER:\nIt is poor here, too.\n\nMR. MITCHELL:\nWell, due to the combination of it being poor here and worse out there, we are\nreceiving the bulletins rather late.\nHas any consideration k e n given to having a teletype feedback on the data,\no\nrather than having to wait for the service bulletin t oome out?\nMS. FISHER:\n\nA s far ae I know, you are the first one who has brought this up, I don\'t know\nwhether it would be feasible o r not,\n\nDR. WINKLER:\n/\n\nI think it muld be, Ae in everything else we do, we need requirements, we\nneed documented requirements, I would encourage you to get it into your\nchannels, I think the possibility exists, but we need requirements. We used to,\n\nthree o r four years ago, have our Series 4 daily phase values, on composite\nbroadcast transmitted twice dally over some 35 frequencies, worldwide. Now,\nthat was instituted baaed on the requirement which we got at that time, and our\nevaluation of these, We think that it was a very good idea,\nBut after a half year, when we had t document how many people were stlll\no\nusing it, we could not jwtify the continuation of that service,\nis alwaye a question of documenting your requirements, and I would only\nencourage everyone who feels that our service should be improved to let ue\nb o w in writing, please,\nSo, it\n\nMS, FISHER:\nI might also mention one more thing to the gentlemen from Kwajalein, It wae\n\ndue t your mggestion, that we incorporated in the reports mme of the other\no\ncesiums at SATCOM terminale, For example, I think you aeked, since you\nwere transferring wlth 550, if we would report the time difference between\ntnarter clock and 550, As you saw on the laut slide, we just etarted, I think\nmaybe two or three Isms ago, we started to include, for example, detaohment\nCharley, the two cesiumr a t Okinawa, and the two cesiums at Camp Roberts.\nWe do apprecriate any conmento from anyone wbo is using the data, and any\nmaggeutiom that you mlght have,\n\nDR. WINKLER:\nI think we will have to move on, Thank you, Ms. Fisher.\n\nI would like to call now on Mr. Robert Easton, to give ue his paper on Submicroaecond Time Transfer between the United States, Pnited Kingdom, and\nAustralia via Satellite.\n\nMr. Eaeton, pleaee.\n\n'
