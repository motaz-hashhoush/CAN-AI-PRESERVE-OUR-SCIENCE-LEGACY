During this period, NASA conducted 2 years of flight testing to characterize forward-looking sensor performance. The NASA/FAA Airborne Windshear Program was divided into three main elements: Hazard Characterization, Sensor Technology, and Flight Management Systems. Simulation models developed under the Hazard Characterization element are correlated with flight test data. Flight test results comparing the performance and characteristics of the various Sensor Technologies (microwave radar, lidar, and infrared) are presented. Most of the activities in the Flight Management Systems element were conducted in simulation. Simulation results from a study evaluating windshear crew procedures and displays for forward-looking sensor-equipped airplanes are discussed. NASA Langley researchers participated heavily in the FAA process of generating certification guidelines for predictive windshear detection systems. NASA participants felt that more valuable technology products were generated by the program because of this interaction. NASA involvement in the process and the resulting impact on products and technology transfer are discussed in this paper.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "Italy", "submissionId": 20040110425, "endDate": "1996-09-13T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "International Council of the Aeronautical Sciences", "location": "Unknown"}}, "meetingId": "d622d6a64ca94a418896069625ee65f2", "id": "61f05f43d50944aaab93bd8345ea8320"}], "name": "20th Congress International Council of the Aeronautical Sciences", "location": "Sorrento", "id": "d622d6a64ca94a418896069625ee65f2", "startDate": "1996-09-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20040110425, "id": "fbf7d442c2d649cd8ccfc9024e217552", "publicationDate": "1996-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20040110425.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20040110425/downloads/20040110425.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20040110425/downloads/20040110425.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20040110425/downloads/20040110425.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
