Starting with the subsystems of an example system, the step-by-step procedure for analysis of the complexity of an overall system is given. The learning curves for the various subsystems are determined as well as the concurrent numbers of relevant design parameters. Then trend curves are plotted for the learning curve slopes versus the various design-oriented parameters, e.g. number of parts versus slope of learning curve, or number of fasteners versus slope of learning curve, etc. Representative cuts are taken from each trend curve, and a figure-of-merit analysis is made for each of the subsystems. Based on these values, a characteristic curve is plotted which is indicative of the complexity of the particular subsystem. Each such characteristic curve is based on a universe of trend curve data taken from data points observed for the subsystem in question. Thus, a characteristic curve is developed for each of the subsystems in the overall system.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19770013496, "id": "2b751caca9eb4a53abcd31418390d724", "publicationDate": "1977-02-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19770013496.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19770013496/downloads/19770013496.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19770013496/downloads/19770013496.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19770013496/downloads/19770013496.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
