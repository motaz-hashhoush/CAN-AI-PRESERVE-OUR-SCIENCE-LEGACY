b'Ground crew veterans at Kennedy Space Center still talk about what they call "the summer of\nhydrogen"-the long, frustrating months in 1990 when the shuttle fleet was grounded by an elusive\nhydrogen leak that foiled our efforts to fill the orbiter\'s external fuel tank.\nI was the external tanWsolid rocket booster project engineer on\nthe ground crew during that painful stretch of mainly trial-anderror efforts to locate &d solve the problem. It drove us crazy for\nmore than six months-a Florida-length summer. As painful as\nit was, the experience demonstrated the incredible dedication\nand persistence of the workforce and, we eventually discovered,\nshowed the importance of designing tests that match flight\nconditions as exactly as possible.\nColumbia (STS-35) was on Launch Pad A for a scheduled\nMay 30 launch when we discovered the hydrogen leak during\ntanking. The external fuel tank is loaded through the orbiter.\nLiquid hydrogen flows through a 17-inch umbilical between the\norbiter and the tank. During fueling, we purge the aft fuselage\nwith gaseous nitrogen to reduce the risk of fire, and we have\na leak-detection system in the mobile launch platform, which\nsamples (via tygon tubing) the atmosphere in and around the\nvehicle, drawing it down to a mass spectrometer that analyzes its\ncomposition. When we progressed to the stage of tanking where\nliquid hydrogen flows through the vehicle, the concentration of\nhydrogen approached four percent-the limit above which it\nwould be dangerously flammable. We had a leak.\nWe did everything we could think of to find it, and the\ncontractor who supplied the flight hardware was there every\nday, working alongside us. We did tanking tests, which involved\ninstrumenting the suspected leak sources, and cryo-loaded the\nexternal tank to try to isolate precisely where the leak originated.\nWe switched out umbilicals; we replaced the seals between the\numbilical and the orbiter. We inspected the seals microscopically\nand found no flaws. We replaced the recirculation pumps,\nand we found and replaced a damaged teflon seal in a main\n\npropulsion system detent cover, which holds the prevalve-the\nmain valve supplying hydrogen to Space Shuttle Main Engine 3\n-in the open position. The seal passed leak tests at ambient\ntemperature but leaked when cryogenic temperatures were\n\nONE MEMBER OF THE GROUND CREW\nEVEN VOLUNTEERED TO SIT IN THE AFT\nFUSELAGE DURING FUELING WEARING AN\nOXYGEN SUPPLY SO HE COULD CARRY\nA SENSOR AROUND FROM POINT TO\nPOINT UNTIL HE FOUND THE LEAK. IT\'S\nNO SURPRISE THAT HIS PROPOSAL WAS\nVETOED ON SAFETY GROUNDS, BUT\nHE WAS READY TO DO IT-THAT\'S HOW\nFRUSTRATED AND DETERMINED WE WERE.\n\napplied. We added new leak sensors-up to twenty at a timeand tried to be methodical in our placements to narrow down\nthe possible sources of the problem. We even switched orbiters,\n\nI\n\nI\n\nsending Columbia back to the Vehicle Assembly Building and\nbringing out Atlantis, scheduled to fly as STS-38. Two shuttles\non their mobile launchers passing in the night was a majestic\nsight, but not one you want to see if you\'re trying to get an\norbiter launched. None of this told us where the leak was, or if\nwe were dealing with more than one leak source.\nOne member of the ground crew even volunteered to sit in\nthe aft fuselage during fueling wearing an oxygen supply so he\ncould carry a sensor around from point to point until he found\nthe leak. It\'s no surprise that his proposal was vetoed on safety\ngrounds, but he was ready to do it-that\'s how frustrated and\ndetermined we were.\nEventually, since nothing else had worked, we put a series\nof leak detectors outside the orbiter, near where the umbilical\nconnected with the external tank. We found the greatest\nconcentration of hydrogen there, so we knew, finally, that the\nleak had to be at the seal we had changed out and so rigorously\ninspected. Now that we knew the leak was there, we were able\nto figure out what was happening We knew from the testing\nthat the leak would appear when the liquid hydrogen, which\nis much colder than the gaseous hydrogen used to chill the\nsystem, was flowing through the vehicle. The extremely cold\nliquid hydrogen made the metal of the joint contract unevenly,\ncreating small gaps that the hydrogen escaped through. The\nfix seems counterintuitive: we added spacers outboard of the\nbolts in the umbilical flange; when the bolts were tightened, the\ninside diameter of the flange squeezed down tighter on the seal.\nWe also slowed the loading sequence to reduce the cold shock\ncreated when the liquid arrived at the joint.\nBut how had the seal passed all its tests at the contractor?\nWhy didn\'t they see the leak then? Since they were working so\nclosely with us, they were able to supply the answers as soon\nas we understood the problem. They had tested the seals with\nliquid nitrogen, not liquid hydrogen. They had a good reason\nfor that choice. Their facility in Downey, once fairly isolated,\nhad seen Los Angeles grow around it. With schools and offices\n\nnearby, testing with hydrogen had become too dangerous. Liquid\nnitrogen was the safe alternative. But liquid hydrogen, at about\n-253"C, is much colder than liquid nitrogen, which liquefies at\nabout -196\xc2\xb0C. Also, hydrogen atoms are many times smaller than\nnitrogen atoms. So the seal worked fine with liquid nitrogen, but\nliquid hydrogen created gaps it could slip through. (Hydrogen\natoms are so small, they can even escape through a weld.)\nThe lessons we took from this experience, in addition\nto seeing that persistence and dedication eventually pay off,\nare these:\nDon\'t take anything for granted.\nStay in constant communication with the\nhardware manufacturer.\nTest as you fly.\nOn October 6,1990, Dhcovevy took off from Launch Pad 39B,\nthe first launch since April. Other successful launches would\noccur in November and December. The summer of hydrogen\nwas over.\n\n'
