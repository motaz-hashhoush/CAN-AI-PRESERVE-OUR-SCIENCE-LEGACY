b'Industrial Productivity and Manufacturing Technology\n\nRobot Tools\nand Automation Corporation,\nMinneapolis, Minnesota manufactures equipment for robotic systems, in particular a variety\nof tools known as "end effectors," devices\nattached to the end of a robot arm for picking\nup, grasping, manipulating and transferring\nobjects. The company traces its lineage to 1981,\nwhen a predecessor organization-INTEC\nCorporation-was formed to design and market\nrobotic peripheral equipment. In May 1984\nINTEC became Mecanotron Corporation and in\n1989 Mecanotron was sold and incorporated into\nRobotics and Automation Corporation.\nAmong the company\'s newer products is the\nAutomatic Robotics Tool-change System\n(ARTS), a system designed to meet growing\ndemand for multiple task work cells for welding and plasma spray functions that require\n\ngrinding and finishing; deburring, deflashing,\nrouting, hole drilling or parts replacement;\nand multiple tool disk operations. The technology incorporated in ARTS systems was originally developed under contracts with Marshall\nSpace Flight Center and with Rockwell International, one of NASA\'s principal contractors.\nThe ARTS systems were designed to work with\nthe company\'s CFD (Constant/controlled\nForce Device) product line, a series of end\neffectors and bench mounted devices for\ncontrolling the constant pressure of abrasive\ntools used to deburr, grind, polish and finish\nproducts fabricated by welding, casting,\nmolding, forging or machining.\nRobotics and Automation Corporation\'s CFD\nline includes three end-of-arm devices and two\n\nA Rocketdyne technician inspects welds on the Space Shuttle Main Engzngzne\ncreated by an advanced robotic system.\n\nbench-mounted devices. They do not require\nthat the robot apply and control the force, only\nthat it move along a normal programmed path\nover the work piece; the CFD applies and\nmaintains the required processing pressure of\nthe finishing media to the work piece.\nWhen the surface to be finished is very rough\nand coarse, several different grades of finishing\nmedia may be needed, as well as different\nspeed and power as the surface finish is\ntransformed. To accommodate this multistep\nprocess within a single work cell, and with a\nsingle robot, Robotics and Automation Corporation developed the automated tool-change\nsystem.\nThe ARTS-I is being used in industrial systems\nwith six tool positions ranging from coarse\n\nsanding disks and abrasive wheels to cloth\npolishing wheels with motors of various\nhorsepower. The ARTS-I1 allows a robot to\nchange welding torches automatically, or to\nexchange a welding torch for a CFD end\neffector to finish a welded assembly with a\nwelding robot; using a second tool-changer\n(ARTS-I) enables finishing the surface conditioning process.\nRobotics and Automation Corporation has sold\nmore than 90 robotic work cells using CFD/\nARTS devices, about one fourth of them in the\nplastics industry. The largest single user\ncategory is fabricators of plastic body parts for\nthe auto industry; other uses range from\nfabrication of radar domes by Texas Instruments to advanced composites at Aerospatiale\nin France.\n\nI\n\nThe tool rack of the Automatic Robotics Tool-change System includes a twojinger pjbper, a\ngrinder, a coated abrasive brush and a welding torch.\n\nThe quick disconnect system\nallows changing tools with\nhydraulic, pneumatic or\nelectric bowm\n\n'
