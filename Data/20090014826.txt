They will be used inside the space\nstation to test a set of well-defined instructions for spacecraft performing autonomous rendezvous and\ndocking maneuvers. Three free-flying spheres will fly within the cabin of the station, performing flight\nformations. Each satellite is self-contained with power, propulsion, computers and navigation equipment.\nThe results are important for satellite servicing, vehicle assembly and formation flying spacecraft\nconfigurations.\nResearch Summary:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nSPHERES uses the internal ISS environment as a test bed for the development and testing of\nmulti-body formation flying and other multi-spacecraft control algorithms.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThree self-contained free-flying satellites will fly within the cabin of the ISS, performing flight\nformations and testing control algorithms. Each satellite is self-contained with power (AA\nbatteries), propulsion (carbon dioxide), computers, and navigation equipment.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThe satellites communicate with each other and an ISS laptop through a low-power 900 MHz\nwireless link.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nPosition information is known by setting up five beacons in the work area for the satellites to\nperform ranging using ultrasound and infrared pulses.\n\nDetailed Research Description: SPHERES is a testbed for formation flying by satellites, the theories\nand calculations that coordinate the motion of multiple bodies maneuvering in microgravity. To achieve\nthis inside the ISS cabin, bowling-ball-sized spheres perform various maneuvers (or protocols), with one\nto three spheres operating simultaneously . The Synchronized Position Hold, Engage, Reorient,\nExperimental Satellites (SPHERES) experiment will test relative attitude control and station-keeping\nbetween satellites, re-targeting and image plane filling maneuvers, collision avoidance and fuel balancing\nalgorithms, and an array of geometry estimators used in various missions.\nSPHERES consists of three self-contained satellites, which are 18 sided polyhedrons that are 0.2 meter\nin diameter and weigh 3.5 kilograms. Each satellite contains an internal propulsion system, power,\navionics, software, communications, and metrology subsystems. The propulsion system uses CO2, which\nis expelled through the thrusters. SPHERES satellites are powered by AA batteries. The metrology\nsubsystem provides real-time position and attitude information. To simulate ground station-keeping, a\nlaptop will be used to transmit navigational data and formation flying algorithms. Once these data are\nuploaded, the satellites will perform autonomously and hold the formation until a new command is given.\nProject Type: Payload\nImages and Captions:\n\nSPHERES hardware in operation on the KC-135.

The ten sessions will be comprised of the following:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nApproximately three sessions will use one satellite\nApproximately seven sessions will use two satellites\nApproximately six sessions will use three satellites\n\nProvided the resources are not exhausted at the end of the 16 sessions, additional sessions may occur\nusing two or three satellites. Approximately eight to twelve tests, each lasting 10-15 minutes, will be run\nduring each test session. Primary location for operations will be in the U.S. Destiny Lab. Node 1 can be\nused as a backup. Operations are not permitted in the Russian segment due to concerns with infrared\ninterference.\nOperational Protocols: During the flight sessions there are three phases: programming SPHERES, free\nflying operations, and data retrieval. Programming the satellites will involve uploading the algorithms for\neach specific session to the SPHERES laptop from the ground crew. The laptop will be used to send the\nalgorithms and commands to the satellites and receive data and status reports from the satellites. The\ndata will then be down linked to the ground crew for analysis. During free-flying operations the satellites\nwill perform various maneuvers with one to three satellites operating simultaneously. Once the test\nsession is complete, the data will be downlinked to the ground, via the Ops LAN, for analysis by the\nSPHERES team. This analysis will allow new and/or modified tests to be uplinked for use in the next test\nsession.\nThe crew will be responsible for unstowing the equipment, setting up the test area, loading the carbon\ndioxide tanks and batteries, uploading and running the protocols from the laptop and stowing the\nequipment at the conclusion of the session.\nReview Cycle Status: PI Reviewed\nCategory: Technology Development\nSub-Category: Picosatellites and Control Technologies\nSpace Applications: Information learned from this experiment may lead to simpler autonomous docking\nallowing for servicing, re-supplying, reconfiguring and upgrading of space systems. The algorithms would\neliminate the complicated maneuvers that require ground teams to coordinate and execute. Secondly,\nthis formation flight technology would lead to Separated Spacecraft Interferometers (light from two or\nmore telescopes that combine to provide a high resolution image).The results will support the\ndevelopment of autonomous spacecraft to carry out a variety of tasks in a space environment. Smaller\nautonomous spacecraft could, with the right coordination and programming, perform tasks too\ncomplicated or too expensive for larger spacecraft to execute.. Examples of these are satellite clusters, a\ncollection of micro-satellites that operate cooperatively to perform the function of a large single satellite.\nEarth Applications: The space technologies for formation flight of small satellites could influence Earthbased applications of current satellite technologies including surveillance, mapping, communications and\nnavigation.\n\nManifest Status: Continuing\nSupporting Organization: Space Operations Mission Directorate (SOMD)\nPrevious Missions: Preliminary signal testing to support SPHERES operations was performed during\nISS Expedition 8. Testing with one satellite was performed early during Expedition 13. The second\nsatellite was delivered to ISS on STS-121 which allowed testing of the two satellite configuration\nbeginning in August 2006. The third satellite was delivered on STS-116; the three satellite configuration\ntesting began on ISS Expedition 14.\nResults: During Expedition 8, several interference tests were conducted in order to characterize the\neffects of lights and other sources of electromagnetic radiation. The "Beacon-Beacon Test" (SPHERESBBT) used one beacon (with mount) and one beacon tester to demonstrate the functionality of the\nultrasound/infrared positioning system of the SPHERES experiment. This portion of the investigation was\na risk mitigation experiment for SPHERES to determine if any sources of infrared radiation or ultrasonic\nwaves exist in the work area that may interfere with SPHERES operations. Infrared interference from a\ngeneral lighting assembly and a laptop in Node was produced during the "Beacon-Beacon Test". Based\non these results, SPHERES test sessions will use the newer laptop and the general lighting assembly will\nbe dimmed by 25 percent in the workspace during SPHERES operations.\nSPHERES test sessions begun during Expedition 13, demonstrated maneuvers that would lead to the\ndocking of a satellite to a beacon, tested algorithms which automatically determine the mass properties of\nthe satellites and performed initial two sphere satellite tests. During these sessions the docking\nmaneuvers were completed successfully and updated to the estimator (calculation of the satellite\'s\nlocation with respect to the beacon) which helped achieve successful approaches. The two satellite tests\nwere successful; these tests demonstrated the functionality of the new satellite and the ability of the\nsatellites to maintain both angular formation (i.e., they point in the same direction all the time) as well as\nposition formation (if one translates the other does too).\nOther SPHERES test sessions performed during Expedition 13 demonstrated the functionality of the\nGlobal Metrology System (during all previous sessions the satellites calculated their position with respect\nto a single beacon or with respect to other satellites, but not with respect to the U.S. Laboratory frame).\nThis session setup the complete metrology system so that the satellites could know their location and\npointing with respect to the U.S. Laboratory. The tests included collection of large amounts of data to\nprocess on the ground to test for the functionality of all the transmitters and receivers in the system as\nwell as the presence of any noise (such as reflections on unexpected objects). The test also\ndemonstrated the functionality of the astronaut interface to indicate to the satellite the location of the\nbeacons in the U.S. Laboratory. All the necessary data was collected. Secondary tests included\nsuccessful demonstration of two satellites docking (controlled contact between the two satellites). These\ntests will ultimately enable scientists to assemble large space structures and make autonomous resupply\nof consumables and upgrades a reality (Saenz-Otero Alvar.
