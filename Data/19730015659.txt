In addition\nGSFC supplied a bulk computer print out of the island of St. Thomas, MSS\nBands 4, 5, 6 and 7. Precision digital data print outs for each of the\nharbor test stations in the 4 MSS bands indicated that considerable radiometric data had been lost when compared with the bulk data. Consequently\nwe reviewed very carefully the bulk data print outs in an effort to use\nthese data for correlation with-the ground stations in order to benefit.\nfrom the greater radiometric fidelity and still locate t\'ach computer print\nout character on a map with acceptable accuracy. A simple grid system\nwhich enables scaling the computer print out to the USC&GS chart was\ndeveloped.\nProgress during April and May is summarized below:\n1.\n\n2.\n\nDeveloped a simple means which will enable correlation of\nbulk data with in-situ data for each of the test stations.\n\n3.\n\nPartially reduced optical measurements of test panels and\nharbor water.\n\n4.\n\nSubsdiearies:\n\nProcessed both precision and bulk CCT tapes in the Grumman\nLM Data Reduction Station.\n\nReceived from our Co-Principal Investigator, Marine Resources\nDevelopment Foundation (Dr. D. Olsen) rough draft summary\nreport of the harbor water quality in-situ measurements.\n\n*\n\nPURITECH INDUSTRIES. INC.\n\n*\n\nSCIENTIFIC ECOLOGY.
