Remote\nsensing is now becoming recognized and acknowledged as a major technological means for providing this kind of information.\n\nThe MSU Remote\n\nSensing Project has been playing a major role in bringing this change\nabout in Michigan.\nThe primary objective of the Project is to work with agencies at all\nlevels of government in Michigan, as well as with private organizations,\nto develop a wide diversity of applications of remote sensing for improving land/resource use decisions and actions.\n\nTo realize this objective,\n\nProject activities are aimed at improving, across the board, the process\nof analyzing and allocating land and resource use in Michigan and eventually developing a responsible and self-supporting community of users\nof remote sensing in the state.\n\nTo accomplish these aims Project staff\n\nconduct demonstration applications of remote sensing, provide user services, and participate in educational activities.\nThe following presentation describes in summary fashion the principal\nactivities engaged during the December 1, 1976 to May 31, 1977 portion of\nthe grant year.\n\nFor reporting purposes, the activities are grouped under\n\nthree broad headings:\n\n(A) application activities, (B) service activities,\n\nand (C) contract activities.\n\nA.\n\nA P P L I C A T I O N\n\nA C T I V I T I E S\n\nThis section reports on applications of remote sensing to selected\nnatural resource situations and problems for which base data could be\nquickly located, identified and evaluated using remote sensing technology.\nThe problems selected were ones for which program implementation and/or\nimprovements in the quality and effectiveness of on-land actions could\noccur.\nSome of these applications initially demanded considerable Project\ninput.\n\nWhen rendered operational, these were gradually transferred to\n\nappropriate agencies for continuation or development to more advanced\nstages which would lead to subsequent actions.\n\nOthers are expected to\n\nreturn to command Project attention from time to time when new information might be determinable or when additional decisions will need to be\nmade regarding on-land applications.\n\nAl.\n\nMosquito Control in Saginaw and Bay Counties\nSaginaw-Bay Mosquito Control Commission\n1416 South River Road\nBay City, Michigan 48706\nThe 1975 outbreak of St. Louis Encephalitis transformed the mosquito\n\nproblem in Michigan from a nuisance to a potentially major health hazard.\nComprehensive control measures however have been hindered by the absence\nof officially designated and funded agencies to deal with the problem.\nAn innovative method of breaking this deadlock was formally put into\noperation for two east central Michigan counties in January, 1977.\n\nThe\n\nSaginaw-Bay Mosquito Control Commission (SBMCC) was established as a private non-profit corporation for the control and abatement of mosquitoes\nand the diseases borne by mosquitoes.\n\nThis organization which is funded\n\nthrough a county millage has a three year period to establish an effective eradication program, and an essential prerequisite for eradication\nis surveillance of potential disease vector sites.\n\nThe executive director\n\nof the SBMCC has estimated that traditional ground survey methods for this\nsurveillance would require three to four years to complete with a staff of\neight to ten individuals participating.\nDiscussions with SMBCC staff suggested that remote sensing data\nsources would be essential in the preparation of an inventory of mosquito habitats.\n\nIt was decided initially that three categories of in-\n\nformation would be provided:\n\n1) Forested Wetlands, 2) Open Wetlands and\n\nMarshes, and 3) Residential Areas.\nMaps of Saginaw and Bay Counties were made showing Forested Wetlands,\nOpen Wetlands and Marshes, and Residential Areas.\n\nThe mapping was done\n\ndirectly from high altitude imagery (NASA, RB-57, May 13, 1975, CIR), at\na scale of approximately 1:120,000, onto acetate overlays.\n\nSimilar ima-\n\ngery was available for July 1, 1975 and was used during the interpretation for comparative purposes.\n\nThe primary information came from the\n\nspring imagery because at this time water levels were at their highest\nand tree foliage did not obscure the ground scene.\n\nDiazo copies of the\n\ninterpreted and delineated acetate overlays were supplied to the SBMCC.\n\nIn addition, the information from the overlays was reduced to a scale of\n1:175,000 and transferred to standard County Highway maps.\n\nThese maps\n\nand a 35mm slide of each map was also supplied to the SBMCC.\n\nThe char-\n\nacteristics of each category are briefly described below:\n1.\n\nForested Wetlands.\n\nThe forested wetlands are defined as those\n\nforest areas which are seasonally wet.\n\nSpring imagery recorded\n\npre-leaf out conditions so that wet areas with high levels of\nsoil moisture or surface water were easily identifiable by their\ndarker hue.\n\nThese areas were for the most part not separable\n\nfrom other forested areas on the July imagery because of tree\nfoliage and soil water losses.\n\nForested river bottoms and ponds\n\nwithin forested areas were also delineated.\n\nThese areas provide\n\na breeding site as well as a habitat for adult mosquitoes.\n2.\n\nOpen Wetlands and Marshes.\n\nAreas of open water were identified\n\nfrom the imagery and verified using 7.5\' and 15\' U.S.G.S. topographic maps to examine for a recorded water body or closed depression.\n\nIt was a wet spring in 1975 and many of the open water\n\nbodies were seasonally flooded. Man-made areas of open water\nbodies such as sewage treatment lagoons, water hazards on golf\ncourses and ponds along major highways were included in this\ncategory.\n\nRiver floodplains that were inundated on the spring\n\nimagery were included as open wetland.\nprimarily open water in the spring.\n\nMarsh areas are also\n\nThese features were dis-\n\ntinguished by the presence of emergent vegetation on the July\nimagery.\n\nThe delineated areas were checked against 7.5\' and\n\n15\' U.S.G.S. topographic maps to verify that all the areas on\nthe maps marked as swamp were also included on the overlays.\n\nIf\n\nthere was a discrepancy the final decision was based on imagery\ninterpretation.\n3.\n\nResidential.\n\nResidential areas were classified as contiguous\n\ngroupings of 20 or more single or multiple family dwellings\neither in a strip or subdivision configuration.\n\nStrip devel-\n\nopment includes dwellings in a single strip, those that are\n\nstaggered on both sides of a road and short strips heading in more\nthan one direction at a road intersection.\n\nMobile home parks with\n\n20 or more residences were also included.\n\nUrban areas were delin-\n\neated as contiguous blocks thus industrial, commercial and open\nspace areas were not separately indicated.\nThe residential delineations were made so that the SBMCC could\nconcentrate their initial spraying efforts in the more densely\npopulated areas.\n\nThese overlays can also be used in conjunction\n\nwith either of the other two to see the relationship between\nresidential (or non-residential) areas and mosquito problem sites.\nIn mid-May 1977 a light plane flight provided imagery of Crow Island\nand critical areas in St. Charles Township to the SBMCC.\n\nColor infrared\n\n35mm slides were acquired for all the sites and 70mm color photography was\nobtained over the Crow Island location.\n\nThis photography provides reference\n\ndata for the interpretation of smaller scale imagery, particularly NASA high\naltitude CIR photography and Landsat data.\nCommission staff are presently using the maps and copies of the NASA\nimagery (which they have purchased) in their office to evaluate their response to in-coming complaint calls.\nthe field.\n\nThe maps are now being evaluated in\n\nThe commission is concurrently comparing the photo-derived map\n\nprocedure against more traditional methods of acquiring habitat data (e.g.\nground surveys).\nIn the year ahead we will be exploring ways in which Landsat data can\nbe applied in their program\xe2\x80\x94both through manual interpretation and computer\nprocessing (pattern recognition).\n\nThe emphasis will be on periodic monitor-\n\ning of specific mosquito breeding habitats via remote sensing and the incorporation of remotely sensed data into a computer-based information and\nanalysis system which will be utilized on an operational basis.\n\nA2.\n\nInventory of Surface Water Accessible to Fire Trucks\nAntrim County Planning Department\nCounty Courthouse\nBellaire, Michigan 49615\nA major problem in Antrim County is locating accessible water sources\n\nfor use by fire fighting units.\n\nAll units reporting to a fire outside of\n\nvillage or city limits have an on-board water supply.\nexpended, the unit has to recharge its tanks.\n\nWhen this supply is\n\nThe trip to recharge should\n\nbe as brief as possible and information regarding the nearest accessible\nwater source is crucial.\nMSU personnel identified and delineated all surface water areas in\nAntrim County of at least 0.2 hectares from 1:36,000 color-infrared photography acquired by the Michigan Department of State Highways and Transportation in 1973.\n\nThe name, type (e.g. natural lake, intermittent stream),\n\nsize and depth of each water area were recorded based on the classification system given in Table I.\nPotential access sites for recharging fire truck water supplies were\nthen identified from the photography.\n\nFor each identified access site, a\n\ndetermination was made from the photography as to the type of access route,\nthe intervening land cover or land use and possible limitations to recharging such as water depth, the presence of aquatic vegetation or slope restrictions.\n\nThe ownership of the access sites, as given in the county plat\n\nbook, was also identified.\n\nThe accessibility classification system employed\n\nis also cited in Table I.\nThe identification of surface water locations from the photography was\naccomplished in 1975, and was reported in our Semi-Annual Progress Report,\nJune-November 1975.\n\nThe project was then delayed because the user agencies,\n\ni.e., the Antrim County Planning Department and local fire departments, intended to establish a standard geographical referencing (address) system for\nthe county, which also would be used in the surface water inventory.\n\nSuch a\n\nsystem never materialized, therefore Project personnel resumed work on the\ninventory in early 1977.\nThe locations of water sources and identified access points were transferred to a series of mylar township base maps at a scale of 1:36,000\n\nTable I.\xe2\x80\x94Antrim

Box 140\nStevensville, Michigan 49127\nThe Grand Mere area, located along the southeast shore of Lake Michigan\n\nin Berrien County, and consisting of streams, bogs, lakes, wooded upland,\nopen beaches and dunes, represents one of Michigan\'s few remaining unique\ndune environments.\n\nThe Grand Mere Association is a group of people who have\n\nexpressed concerns relative to the impact of man on the Grand Mere area in\nterms of land use changes of parts of the area or adjacent buffer zones and\nthe impact of intensive recreational\n\nactivities.\n\nAssistance from the MSU Remote Sensing Project was requested for deriving crucial information from remote sensing data on essential ecological\nparameters affecting the future existence of the Grand Mere area.\n\nThe most\n\ncrucial information needed was data documenting the impact of Off-RoadVehicles (ORV) on the environment, particularly erosion and damage to the\nvegetation cover of shorelands and dunes on state-owned and private properties.\nThe loss of vegetative cover between 1970 and 1976 due to ORV activities in two sample areas was determined by a temporal analysis of 1:5,000\npanchromatic photography and specially acquired 70mm color photography.\nExtrapolation of the derived recession rates indicated that if no ORV access limiting measures were taken, complete vegetation loss could occur\nwithin one to three decades.\nThe Grand Mere Association used the photography and derived information to convince property owners and township authorities of the need to\nprohibit ORV use in the area.\n\nIn the spring of 1977, an ORV enforcement\n\nprogram was started under a special appropriation of funds for the township police department.\n\nApproximately 200 traffic citations were issued\n\nduring the first two months of the program.\n\nThe information supplied by\n\nthe Remote Sensing Project provided a technically sound base and impetus\nfor this legal action.\n\n14\n\nB.\n\nS E R V I C E\n\nA C T I V I T I E S\n\nProject personnel routinely provide consultation on the use of imagery,\neducational activities not a part of other user applications, and support\nmaterials to foster additional remote sensing applications by prospective\nusers.\nThe MSU Project team has acted as a service bureau for an increasing\nnumber of potential users.\n\nTo facilitate this function, Project staff have\n\nprovided general technical assistance, NASA-produced imagery, and training\nin the use of equipment to a broad range of user agencies.\nThe type and amount of assistance provided varied among agencies, but\nhas basically included the following activities:\n(1) problem identification;\n(2) data source identification;\n(3) data classification procedures;\n(4)\n\nidentification of decisions that need to be made (policy and\naction choices);\n\n(5) determining the data needs of various policy and action choices;\n(6) assistance in reviewing available imagery;\n(7) assistance in acquiring available imagery and equipment;\n(8)\n\nimagery interpretation training; and\n\n(9) merging remotely-sensed data with other natural resource information.\nIt is expected that the major benefit to be derived from these service\nbureau activities is the preliminary education of agencies and individuals\nto the potential of remote sensing for day-to-day or periodic needs.\n\nAt an\n\nappropriate stage in each agency\'s program, remote sensing may be the most\neconomical tool to accomplish program objectives.\nFurthermore, comparative analysis can be accomplished by effectively\nmerging remotely-sensed land cover/use data with other natural resource\ninformation using an integrated, computer-based information system.\n\nThis\n\nprovides a powerful tool for regional analysis and the development of appropriate land/resource use decisions and subsequent on-land actions.\n\nSuch\n\na system is currently under development at MSU and is reported in section Bl.\n\n15\n\nThe Remote Sensing Project at Michigan State University is cooperating\nwith Michigan agencies to develop practical uses of remote sensing technology for effective land/resource use decisions and actions.\n\nPart of this\n\nprogram is the organization of a centralized source of information on aerial\nimagery.\n\nThe Guide to Aerial Imagery of Michigan documents this inventory\n\neffort and is described in section B2.\n\n16\n\nBl.\n\nResource Analysis Program\nActivities continue to grow in which the Project utilizes computer-\n\nbased information systems for storage, analysis, and display of remote\nsensing and other natural resource data.\n\nLarger and larger geographic\n\nareas are having natural resource data files being assembled.\n\nIt is the\n\nexperience of Project staff that remote sensing derived data form the\ncore of such systems, and combining this data with other data provides an\nexpanded opportunity for users to involve themselves with the dynamics of\nremote sensing in the role of decision making.\nThe Project has been developing a computer program for the analysis\nof grid-based information system data.\n\nThis period of activity has seen\n\na major revision and improvement in several facets of the Resource Analysis\nProgram (RAP).\n\nThe analytical and mapping phases required for the agricul-\n\ntural land use assessment technique has been incorporated into the main\nbody of the program (see section A3., this report for further discussion\nof this application).\n\nInternal features of file construction and mani-\n\npulation have been revised for increased efficiency.\n\nA data compression\n\ntechnique is being incorporated that will allow data manipulation for\nlarger geographic areas.\n\nFurthermore, this will make RAP directly com-\n\npatible with various remote sensing data sources, such as Landsat, and\nmerged aerial photography-Landsat data files (see section C3. of this\nreport for further discussion of this latter technique).\nAs evidence of increased use of this system, an additional 56 townships in Michigan were inventoried and files under a contractual arrangement were created that can now be used with RAP.\ntion, see reference 49 listed in the Appendix.\n\nFor additional informa-\n\n17\n\nB2.\n\nGuide to Aerial Imagery of Michigan\nPreparation of the guide has been a continuing effort for the past two\n\nyears.\n\nIt started as a simple revision of an existing guide (Users Guide\n\nto High Altitude Imagery of Michigan) but has subsequently developed into\nan undertaking of considerable magnitude as information on the full range\nof remotely-sensed imagery available of Michigan has been incorporated into\nthe new guide.\nThe final draft of the guide has been prepared during this reporting\nperiod.\n\nThe Agricultural Experiment Station at MSU has accepted the guide\n\nfor publication.\n\nA brochure announcing the forthcoming release of the\n\nguide was distributed in July 1977 as Research Report 340 of the MSU\nAgricultural Experiment Station.\n\nThe Michigan Department of Natural Re-\n\nsources is financially supporting a portion of the publication costs with\nthe remainder paid by the Agricultural Experiment Station.\nprinting of 1,500\n\nto 2,000 copies is being made.\n\nAn initial\n\n18\n\nC.\n\nC O N T R A C T\n\nA C T I V I T I E S\n\nDue to Project demonstration activities, there has been an increasing\nneed by public and private agencies within the state for the utilization\nof remote sensing technology on a periodic project basis.\n\nIn most cases,\n\nhowever, agencies lack the appropriate equipment and the photo interpretative skill to meet the need.\n\nThey usually do not retain staff with photo\n\ninterpretation expertise because their services are not needed on a continual\nbasis.\n\nHowever, most agencies would like to have a means of acquiring such\n\nskills for limited periods to complete specific projects.\n\nMSU has the capa-\n\nbility to meet this need through either a contractual or student support\nbasis due to the development of on-campus faculty and student remote sensing expertise by Project personnel.\nAll of the contract activities have occurred as a direct spin off from\nProject demonstration activities and demonstrate the commitment of funds by\nother agencies to the use of remote sensing.\n\nThey have been included in\n\nthis report in order to substantiate the repetitive need for photo-derived\ninformation and the operational capability of previously demonstrated remote sensing procedures for specific data acquisition needs.\n\n19\n\nCl.\n\nComprehensive Resource Inventory and Evaluation System (CRIES) Project\nThe contract with the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Economic Research\n\nService (ERS) continued throughout this reporting period.\nareas of activity were investigated:\n\nThree significant\n\ndevelopment of geocoding methods for\n\nlarge geographic areas, generating data for economic planning by visual interpretation of Landsat imagery, and development of techniques for creating\nland information systems for country-wide planning.\nA manual technique has been developed by which large area maps can be\ndigitized at a relatively low cost.\n\nThe technique involves little advanced\n\ntechnology, and so is highly suitable for the eventual transfer to the developing countries in which the CRIES project is currently operating.\n\nThe\n\ntechnique involves not only the data digitization stage, but also methods\nfor verification, correction, and mapping using small, inexpensive computers.\nThe Landsat demonstration for country-wide economic planning was nearly\ncomplete at the end of the reporting period.\n\nFour test sites within the\n\nDominican Republic were visually interpreted for eleven land cover categories.\n\nTwo of these sites were also being digitally interpreted by\n\nIntralab at NASA, Goddard, in order to provide a basis of comparison for\ncontinued use by Dominican technicians.\n\nInitial field checking verified\n\nthe accuracy of the visual interpretation to a highly acceptable degree.\nInformation system development entered the prototype stage during\nthis reporting period.\n\nNine thematic maps of the Dominican

Inventory\nSoil\nU.S.\n1405\nEast\n\nConservation Service\nDepartment of Agriculture\nSouth Harrison Road\nLansing, Michigan 48824\n\nThe Soil Conservation Service contracted with the MSU Project for the\nidentification of unique farmland areas, new water areas, and new urban\nbuilt-up areas that are not delineated on the published soil survey sheets\nfor Lapeer, Macomb, Muskegon, St. Glair and Washtenaw Counties in Michigan.\nThe inventories were derived from either panchromatic or NASA high altitude\ncolor-infrared aerial photography flown in 1975.\n\nAll water, urban built-up,\n\nand unique farmland areas more than 10 acres in size were identified and\ndelineated through manual interpretation of the aerial photography. Unique\nfarmlands are lands other than those designated prime that are used for the\nproduction of specific high-value food and fiber crops (e.g. tree and bush\nfruits, vineyards and vegetables).\nThe final product was a set of soil survey atlas sheets (maps) for\neach county indicating water, urban built-up and unique farmland areas.\nThe data satisfies part of the Land Inventory and Monitoring (LIM) program of the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the SCS for the counties.\nUnder this program, prime farmlands will also be delineated, area calculations per category will be estimated and a final Important Farmlands\nMap will be produced for each county.\n\n21\n\nC3.\n\nRegion V Land Cover/Use Inventory\nRegion V GLS\n100 Phoenix Building\n801 South Saginaw Street\nFlint, Michigan 48502\n\nBendix Corporation\nAerospace Systems Division\n3621 South State Road\nAnn Arbor, Michigan 48107\n\nThe Bendix Corporation, Aerospace Systems Division sub-contracted with\nthe MSU Project for the provision of certain data products and services in\nsupport of a land cover/use inventory for the Region V Planning and Development Commission of Genesee, Lapeer, and Shiawassee Counties, Michigan.\nProject personnel identified, to a 5-acre level of detail, eight urban land\nuse categories from high altitude CIR photography.\n\nThe urban category de-\n\nlineations were digitized and subsequently integrated with computer categorized Landsat data processed on the Bendix M-DAS system.\n\nMSU used the\n\ndigital multi-source data files to produce 1:24,000 computer-generated\nplotter maps on mylar for each of the 52 townships in the region.\n\nThree\n\ncounty maps ( : 8 0 0 were then produced through photographically\n14,0)\n\nreduc-\n\ning and merging individual township maps.\nThis contract was a direct spin off from a merging procedure developed\njointly by the Project under the NASA grant and by the Bendix Corporation\n(reported in the previous Semi-Annual Progress Report, June 1976-November\n1976 and reference #50 in the Appendix of this report) .\n\n22\n\nC4.\n\nTri-County Natural Resources Information System\nTri-County Regional Planning Commission\n2722 East Michigan Avenue\nLansing, Michigan 48912\nThe MSU Project prepared a grid geocoded natural resource information\n\nfile for Bath, Delhi, Dewitt, and Watertown Townships in Michigan under a\ncontract from the Tri-County Regional Planning Commission.\n\nLand use, soils,\n\nand elevation data were recorded for each 10-acre cell of the townships\nfrom the 1972 Tri-County Land Use/Cover Inventory maps derived from NASA\nhigh altitude color-infrared aerial photography, the county soil survey\nmap, and U.S.G.S. topographic quandrangles, respectively.\nA scaled, 10-acre cell grid was superimposed and registered to each\ndata source map.\n\nThe dominant factor (e.g. land use) in each cell and the\n\ncell identifier codes (row/column coordinates) were recorded on computer\ncoding forms.\n\nThe township data were then keypunched, verified, and en-\n\ncoded on a tape file.\nA computer program transposed the initial data symbol codes into\nnumeric sequence codes that allow subsequent analysis of the data using\nthe Resource Analysis Program (RAP).\n\nSequence codes were determined for\n\nsoil management group, slope, drainage and land use.\nThe final product was a machine-readable card data deck for each of\nthe four townships.\n\nEach data record (card image) contained:\n\n1) county\n\nidentifier code, 2) township identifier code, 3) row and column coordinate,\n4) soil symbol, 5) soil management group number, 6) soil management group\ncode, 7) slope code, 8) drainage code, 9) land use symbol, 10) land use\ncode, and 11) the elevation of that 10-acre cell.\n\n23\n\nA p p e n d i x\nP U B L I C A T I O N S\n\na n d\n\nP R E S E N T A T I O N S\n\nof the Michigan State University Project\n\n1.\n\n"Investigation of Land Resource Use in Southeast Michigan."
