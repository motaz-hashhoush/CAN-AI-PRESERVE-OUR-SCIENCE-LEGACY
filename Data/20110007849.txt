This 16 g \xe2\x80\x9crocklet\xe2\x80\x9d was\ncollected at Station 13 on the ejecta blanket of North\nRay Crater at the foot of Smoky Mountain [2]. Originally classified as a Very High Alumina (VHA) basalt\non geochemical grounds [3], it was later argued to be\nan impact melt rock [4]. Here we report a Rb-Sr and\nSm-Nd isotopic study that shows that some portions of\nthe rock failed to reach isotopic equilibrium on last\nmelting in agreement with the impact melt rock interpretation. Nevertheless, by omitting mineral fractions\nthat are discordant with the majority of the data, we\narrive at the time of last melting as 3.88\xc2\xb10.05 Ga ago.\nThis age is in agreement with the 39Ar/40Ar plateau age\nof 3839\xc2\xb123 Ma [5], if the latter is adjusted for the\n~1.4-1.8% revision in the age of the hornblende monitor [6]. This investigation was undertaken in part as\nproof-of-concept for SPA-basin sample return.\nPetrology, Sampling, Sm and Nd Abundances :\nRock 63545 was one of the rocks originally considered\nby Hubbard et al. [3] to constitute a group of Very\nHigh Al2O3 (VHA) \xe2\x80\x9cbasalts\xe2\x80\x9d.

REE abundances in 63545,2 [3] and mineral separates compared to KREEP basalts 15382 and 15386.\n\nposition of VHA rocks is characterized by Al2O3 in the\nrange ~20-24% and FeO in the range ~5-8% [3]. REE\nabundances are characterized by La in the range ~5070 X chondritic. A more comphensive compositional\nstudy [7] placed 63545 into sub-group 2M, \xe2\x80\x9clow-Sc\nVHA\xe2\x80\x9d, or as an aluminous variant of 2NR. Texturally,\nit was classified as a \xe2\x80\x9csubophitic-ophitic-intersertal\n(clast-free) impact melt rock\xe2\x80\x9d [8] and placed into the\n\xe2\x80\x9caluminous subophitic group by [5]. Photomicrographs\n\nof 63545 [4] show a subophitic texture like 63549 [5],\nbut also a fine-grained, recrystallized anorthositic clast.\nCompositionally \xe2\x80\x9cVHA basalts\xe2\x80\x9d are grossly similar\nto KREEP basalts like15382 and 15386, but characterized by higher Al2O3 and lower REE abundances. (cf.\nFig. 1). Because in a melting experiment Delano [5]\nfound plagioclase to be absent from the liquidus of a\n63545 composition he concluded that its negative Eu\nanomaly could not be a result of petrogenesis via partial melting. Delano [4] thus favored an origin via impact-fusion of highlands components, in agreement\nwith modern consensus on the origin of VHA basalts.\nAlthough 63545 is not endogenously igneous in\norigin, its subophitic texture makes it amenable to mineral separation procedures routinely used to study basalts. A finely powdered sample (258 mg) retained\nfrom previous studies was sieved into 200-325 (115\nmg) and <325 mesh size fractions. Each size fraction\nwas \xe2\x80\x9cwashed\xe2\x80\x9d in 2N HCl and the wash retained as\n\xe2\x80\x9cLeachates\xe2\x80\x9d. As for basalts, the leachates were greatly\nenriched in both Sm and Nd compared to the whole\nrock, showing LREE-enrichment (Fig. 1). A plagioclase-enriched fraction (Plag(r)) was floated from the\n200-325 mesh fraction in heavy liquid of density =\n2.85 g/cm3. A pyroxene-enriched fraction (Px(r)) sank\nat = 3.32 g/cm3. An intermediate density fraction\nwith 2.85< <3.32 g/cm3 is designated Plag+Px(r). REE\nabundances of Px(r) were lowest among the fractions\nand LREE-depleted as expected for pyroxene. Unexpectedly, REE in Plag(r) were greater than in Px(r),\nand also LREE-depleted compared to the whole rock\n(WR), suggesting incomplete removal of pyroxene.\nDelano [4] described pink spinel, plagioclase, olivine, pyroxene, interstitial glass, minor oxides, and\nmetal in 63545. No electron probe studies were available to him, and we know of none. Phosphates were not\ndescribed, but are likely contributors to the leachates\nand should be sought in this rock and in others like it.\nSm-Nd Data: Sm and Nd isotopic data of several\nfractions do not satisfy an isochron relationship (Fig.\n2), implying the mineral grains in them did not come to\ncomplete isotopic equilibration. However, WR (unleached, <325 mesh), the two leachates, and Px(r) are\ncollinear within 1 -unit and define an age of\n3.91\xc2\xb10.10 Ga, and Nd = -0.4\xc2\xb10.4 consistent with derivation from LREE-enriched parental materials.\nRb-Sr Data: Whole rock 87Rb/86Sr ~ 0.06 is high\ncompared to lunar mare basalts.

The Sr concentration in the Plag(r) separate exceeded that in the\nwhole rock by ~40%, but the Rb concentration was\nincreased proportionally, possibly due to an unseparated late-crystallizing phase (interstitial glass?). The\nleachates had the lowest 87Rb/86Sr ratios. Compared to\nthe whole rock, Rb was depleted by ~65%, whereas Sr\nwas depleted by only ~9%. Sr-isotopic equlibration\nappears to have been incomplete because the Plag(r)\nand WR(r) data are displaced from an isochron through\nthe remaining data. The isochron age is 3.84\xc2\xb10.10 Ga\n( (87Rb) = 1.402 Ga-1 [9]).\nDiscussion: Several Apollo 16 impact melt rocks\nhave been dated by the Rb-Sr method ([10,11,12,13],\nbut this investigation reports the first determination of\na Sm-Nd isochron for this rock type. Such rocks are\ncomposed of mixtures of two or more lithic components, and isochron methods are subject to ambiguity\nbecause of possibly incomplete isotopic equilibration\namong components during a brief melting episode.\nThis uncertainty is circumvented if two isochron methods are applied and age concordancy achieved.\n\nApollo 16 Impact Melt Rock 63545\n0.704\n\n0.703\n\nReimold et al. [10] analysed the more coarselycrystalline 67747 obtaining an age of 3.91\xc2\xb10.04 Ga\nadjusted to (87Rb) = 1.402 Ga-1, and initial 87Sr/86Sr\nISr = 0.69952\xc2\xb10.00010 in agreement with the present\nresults for 63545. Fig. 4 shows Rb-Sr data for VHA\nrock 60335 (also group 2M [7]) combined with those\nfor 63545. The combined data yield an isochron age of\n3.90\xc2\xb10.07 Ga and ISr = 0.699547\xc2\xb10.000052 refining\nthe (T, ISr) parameters for VHA melt rocks first reported by [14] from a whole rock isochron.\nConclusions: The weighted average Rb-Sr ages of\nof VHA melt rocks 67747 and 63543 of 3.90\xc2\xb10.04 Ga\nagrees with the Rb-Sr ages of Apollo 15 KREEP basalts (e.g., 3.88\xc2\xb10.04 for 15434,73 [15]) as well as that\nof Apollo 16 KREEP-rich impact melt rock 65015\n(3.89\xc2\xb10.01, adjusted, [12]) and also the Sm-Nd age of\n63545. Furthermore, VHA rocks bear the characteristic REE pattern of KREEP (Fig. 1). Thus, we tentatively identify the age of this sample group with the Imbrium basin. That this ~3.90 Ga exceeds the widely\naccepted age of 3.85\xc2\xb10.02 Ga [16] by ~1.3% may be\nexplainable by a necessary revision of the age of the\nMmhb-1 monitor by 1.4-1.8% [6].\nReferences: [1] Lofgren G.
