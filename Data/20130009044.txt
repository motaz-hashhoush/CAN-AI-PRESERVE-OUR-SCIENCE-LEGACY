b'Anti-Icing Formulas Prevent Train Delays\nNASA Technology\n\nI\n\nn the winter of 2009, Washington, DC, workers\nfaced the prospect of a difficult commute due to\nrecord-setting snowfalls. But thousands of the\ncity\xe2\x80\x99s Metrorail riders found the public transportation\nsystem fully functional, thanks in part to a NASA\ntechnology invented years before.\nJust like trains, an airplane must be snow- and icefree to ensure safe travel. Traditionally, fluids containing\na compound called ethylene glycol have been used to\ninhibit ice on planes. In 1992, however, the US Air Force\nbanned its purchase of this ingredient due to toxicity\nconcerns. According to the Centers for Disease Control,\nexposure to large amounts of ethylene glycol through air\nor water can damage the kidneys, nervous system, lungs,\nand heart. Urine samples from airport deicing workers\nhave contained traces of the substance.\nAt the time of the Air Force\xe2\x80\x99s ban, Robert Lockyer\nwas working at NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Ames Research Center in the\nAdvanced Composites Model Development Branch,\nwhere he says \xe2\x80\x9cwe decided to pick up the gauntlet and\nbegan researching existing fluid compositions and the\nprocesses used in deicing aircraft.\xe2\x80\x9d\nAlong with Lockyer, in 1997 Ames researchers Leonard\nHaslim and John Zuk devised a nontoxic, biodegradable,\nand cost effective substitute for ethylene glycol. When\napplied to a dry surface before a snow or ice event, the\nsolution prevented ice from forming a bond with the surface. This made it easy to wipe away any accumulation.\n\nTechnology Transfer\nA couple of years after Ames patented its innovation,\na lab manager at Canton, Ohio-based Midwest Industrial\nSupply Inc. read about the formula being used on military\naircraft. Thinking that it would greatly enhance existing\nanti-icing technology, the manager approached Ames\nto license the technology for commercial use. By 1999,\n50\t\n\nTransportation\t\n\nMidwest began blending the NASA technology into an\nexisting anti-icing agent, and also created a new product.\n\nBenefits\nSince 1975, Midwest has been a provider of Earthconscious solutions in the quarry, mining, construction,\niron/steel, and rail/mass transit industries. Over the last\n5 years, the company has appeared several times on Inc.\nmagazine\xe2\x80\x99s list of America\xe2\x80\x99s Fastest Growing Private\nCompanies.\nOne of the company\xe2\x80\x99s original products, Ice Free\nSwitch (IFS), remains successful today. IFS is a fluid that\nmaintains railroad track switch operation in snow or ice.\nRailroad track switches transfer trains and equipment on\nand off of varying tracks. Shannon Noble, a sales manager\nat the company, says every track generally has at least two,\nand train yards usually have dozens of track switches. If\nsnow or ice builds up on a component of a switch, a train\nhas to stop until the buildup is cleared, causing delays and\nbacklogs.\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s very important that switches operate flawlessly,\nquickly, and easily because there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of activity on\nthem,\xe2\x80\x9d says Noble. \xe2\x80\x9cEven a little ice can prevent a switch\nfrom properly throwing.\xe2\x80\x9d\nBy incorporating NASA technology into IFS, Midwest\nimproved the product in two important ways: The fluid is\nboth easier to apply and more likely to remain on vertical\nsurfaces. \xe2\x80\x9cYears ago, when you tried to get a formula to\nstay on the surface at very cold temperatures, it became\ntoo thick and hard to apply. If it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t stay in place, it\ngives little residual value,\xe2\x80\x9d describes Noble.\nIFS disrupts the freezing process of water molecules by\nplacing \xe2\x80\x9cgaps\xe2\x80\x9d between the molecules. Any precipitation\nthat falls will not turn into ice or build up on the surface\nof the treated area. Instead, most precipitation melts or\nbecomes a soft-like slush. Due to this characteristic, IFS\nis known as an anti-icing agent rather than a deicing\nagent. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen dealing with winter operational issues, one\napproach is proactive, one is reactive,\xe2\x80\x9d says Noble. \xe2\x80\x9cThe\n\ndisadvantage with deicing is it requires 5 to 10 times more\nof a deicing chemical agent than anti-icing would initially\nrequire.\xe2\x80\x9d\nCustomers across rail markets are using IFS, including large interstate railroads, regional railroads, short-line\nrailroads, mass transit railroads, and industrial plant and\nfactory railroads. The product has also been applied to the\nwalls of train tunnels, on train crossing arms, on the door\ntracks of boxcars, and in other areas where metal freezes\nand operation becomes problematic.\nAfter improving IFS, Midwest began focusing on a\nnew anti-icing product designed for the third rail of mass\ntransit train tracks. For certain train systems, the third rail\n\nRailroads use Ice Free Switch, incorporating NASA technology,\nto stop water from becoming ice on train track switches. This\nhelps to maintain train service during winter weather events.\n\nSpinoff 2012\n\nSpinoff 2012\n\n\t\n\nImage courtesy of Gary Pancavage\n\nis the source of electrical power. As Noble explains, \xe2\x80\x9cIce\ncan glaze on the third rail, and if it gets thick enough, the\nmetal contact shoe will lift off the third rail and ride on\ntop of the ice. When that happens, the power supply is\ndisrupted, causing stalled trains.\xe2\x80\x9d\nTo prevent disruption, Midwest\xe2\x80\x99s Zero Gravity Third\nRail product, based on the licensed NASA technology,\nstops moisture from becoming ice on the third rail. The\nproduct is automatically applied by a system attached to a\ntrain car, with a sensor detecting the location of the third\nrail. A spray nozzle alternates to the side with the third\nrail while the train is moving and delivers solution based\non the train speed, pressure setting, and nozzle selection.\n\xe2\x80\x9cEvery 4th, 5th, or even 10th train can apply the product\nwith assurance that the third rail isn\xe2\x80\x99t going to experience\na problem,\xe2\x80\x9d says Noble.\nBy preventing moisture from becoming ice, Zero\nGravity Third Rail helps prevent interrupted passenger\nservice. Today, the biggest customers are mass transit\nauthorities in cities like Washington, DC, New York,\nand Toronto. In 2009, when Washington, DC, had\nrecord-setting snowfalls, up to 41 delivery systems were\nemployed on the city\xe2\x80\x99s Metrorail to keep the third\nrails from freezing. Airports and hospitals have also\nused the product on passenger trains with a third rail,\nand steel mills have used it on cranes and other electrical\npower rails.\nDepending on the severity of a winter season, the two\nproducts provide Midwest with an increase in revenue\nbetween $300,000 and $600,000 a year. In addition,\nthe products have helped to prevent seasonal layoffs\nduring Midwest\xe2\x80\x99s typically slower winter months. For\nthe public, the NASA-derived innovations are helping\nprovide reliable train service, as well as supporting a cleaner\nenvironment and improved health. When used as directed,\nthey are noncorrosive, nonconductive, nonflammable,\nand biodegradable\xe2\x80\x94providing safe anti-icing and\ndeicing alternatives for commuters, workers, and the\nenvironment alike. v\nTransportation\t\n\n51\n\n'
