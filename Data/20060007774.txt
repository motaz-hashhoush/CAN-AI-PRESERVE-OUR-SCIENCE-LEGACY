These programs and the cabin atmosphere revitalization process\ntechnologies and systems developed for them represent the National Aeronautics and Space\nAdministration\xe2\x80\x99s (NASA) past and present operational knowledge base for maintaining a\nsafe, comfortable environment for the crew. The contributions of these programs to the\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s technological and operational working knowledge base as well as key strengths and\nweaknesses to be overcome are discussed. Areas for technological development to address\nchallenges inherent with the Vision for Space Exploration (VSE) are presented and a plan\nfor their development employing unit operations principles is summarized.\nI.\n\nIntroduction\n\n0\n\nVER the course of the United States\xe2\x80\x99 space exploration program, the National Aeronautics and Space\nAdministration (NASA) has developed and operated a variety of environmental control and life support\n(ECLS) systems to achieve a range of space exploration objectives. Beginning with Project Mercury and continuing\nthrough the International Space Station (ISS) program, the technological solutions to safely support human life in\nthe hostile space environment have evolved fiom those required to support a single astronaut for minutes or hours to\nthose supporting for crews of three or more for months and ultimately years.\nThe Vision for Space Exploration (VSE) presents new challenges and performance standards that build on and\nextend the NASA\xe2\x80\x99s experience and working knowledge of ECLS systems. Objectives specified by the VSE are the\nfollowing:\xe2\x80\x99\n1) Implementing sustained, affordable space exploration programs\n2) Extending human presence across the solar system\n3) Developing innovative technologies, knowledge, and infrastructure in support of exploration decisions\n4) Promoting international and commercial participation to further the United States\xe2\x80\x99 scientific, security,\nand economic interests\nThe principle aim of the NASA\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to develop the next generation of ECLS systems is to realize objectives\nthrough enabling technological development and applied performance characterization. Developing atmosphere\nrevitalization process technologies and characterizing their performance for application to NASA\xe2\x80\x99s next generation\ncrewed spacecraft is a leading initiative toward realizing the VSE\xe2\x80\x99s goals.\n\nI.\nI\n\nAtmosphere Revitalization On Board Crewed Spacecraft-Past and Present\nThe atmosphere revitalization systems developed to enable past and present space exploration goals form the\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s working knowledge base for process technologies and equipment embodiments capable of maintaining a\nsafe, comfortable cabin environment for space explorers. Table 1 summarizes the basic features of atmosphere\nsupply and revitalization technologies employed on board various crewed spacecraft.*-\xe2\x80\x99 Of these, the experiences\ngained from the Apollo, Skylab, and ISS programs are most relevant to meeting the goals set forth by the VSE.

Atmosphere Revitalization Process Classification\nAtmosphere revitalization processes can be classified into two basic categories-separations and reactions.\nSeparations include physical adsorption, absorption, and mechanical filtration processes. Reactions include\nchemical adsorption, oxidation, and reduction processes. Phase-change processes are typically employed for\nhumidity control. NASA\'s present capabilities include equipment on board the Shuttle orbiter and ISS employing\nseparations- and reaction-based processes to remove carbon dioxide (COz) from the cabin atmosphere. Trace\nvolatile organic compounds (VOCs) are removed primarily via separations processes. Some trace atmospheric\ncomponents such as formaldehyde, carbon monoxide, and methane require reactive processes for achieving effective\ncontrol. Particulate matter (PM) is typically removed from the cabin atmosphere by separations processes\nemploying mechanical filtration. Inertial techniques may also be used for PM control.\n\nB.

The summary provided by Table 1 shows the atmosphere revitalization processes\nused on board the Shuttle orbiter are fundamentally the same as those used for the Mercury, Gemini, and Apollo\nprograms. The primary difference lies in the specific hardware embodiments whereby bed geometry and process\nflow rates may vary. Also, the cabin total pressure condition is different. Shuttle processes rely predominantly on\n\n2\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nL\n\nexpendable resources while the ISS ECLS system is composed of processes that employ in-situ regeneration. The\nfollowing is a brief summary of the atmospheric purification processes used on board the Shuttle orbiter and ISS.\n1. Atmosphere Revitalization Processes On Board the Shuttle Orbiter and Spacelab Module\nCarbon dioxide partial pressure control is provided on board the Shuttle orbiter by contacting the cabin\natmosphere with granular lithium hydroxide (LiOH). The LiOH reacts irreversibly with C02 to form lithium\ncarbonate (Li2CO3) and water (H20). Carbon dioxide removal by reversible reaction with functionalized amines has\nbeen demonstrated on board the Shuttle orbiter but is not presently deployed on board an operational spacecraft or\nspace habitat. In this process, reversible reaction between carbon dioxide and the functionalized amine is promoted\nby a vacuum-swing process.*\nEach LiOH canister contains a small amount of granular activated carbon (GAC) that serves to protect the LiOH\nfrom contaminantsthat may interfere with Cop\'s reaction with LiOH. The GAC also provides some degree of odor\ncontrol but is not sized sufficiently to serve as a broad spectrum trace contaminant removal mechanism. Targeted\ntrace contaminant control is provided using platinized GAC (Pt-GAC) contained in a low volumetric flow canister\nknown as the ambient temperature catalytic oxidation (ATCO) unit. The Pt-GAC, is designed to promote carbon\nmonoxide (CO) oxidation to C 0 2 at normal cabin temperature conditions. A small amount of GAC is included in\nthe ATCO unit to protect the Pt-GAC material from poi~oning.~*\'~\nOverall, the bulk of the trace contaminant removal on board the Shuttle orbiter occurs via absorption by\nhumidity condensate. Absorption by humidity condensate occurs naturally and has been shown to be a significant\nThe cabin temperature and humidity control\nremoval mechanism for water-soluble chemical\nequipment on board the Shuttle orbiter, however, are not specifically designed to provide or optimized to enhance\nthis function. The active contaminationcontrol equipment design also does not take credit for the assist provided by\ncontaminant absorption by humidity condensate. Such an approach provides a built-in design safety factor. This\nphenomenon must be accounted for if there is a desire to reclaim the humidity condensate for human c~nsumption.\'~\nThe Spacelab program employed the same C02, particulate matter, and humidity control techniques used by the\nShuttle orbiter. One difference was the use of a larger module specifically designed for broad spectrum trace\ncontaminant control. The Spacelab transfer tunnel scrubber contained a layered fixed bed of GAC. The first layer\nconsisted of GAC treated with phosphoric acid (H3P04)that targeted ammonia (NH3) and other trace VOCs. The\nsecond layer consisted of untreated GAC. Both the first and second layers served to protect the third layer,\nconsisting of Pt-GAC, from p~isoning.\'~."\n2. Atmosphere Revitalization Processes On Board the International Space Station\nThe principle atmosphere revitalization processes on board the ISS are embodied by the C02 removal assembly\n(CDRA) and the trace contaminant control system (TCCS). This equipment is mounted in a dedicated atmosphere\nrevitalization subsystem (ARS)\nrack shown in Figure 1.\nThe C 0 2 removal assembly\n(CDRA) process design used on\nboard the ISS is derived from\nthat used on board Skylab. Both\nprocesses use zeolites to remove\nmoisture and C02 from the\nprocess gas stream yet achieve\nslightly different performance\nobjectives.\nWhile Skylab\nemployed a 2-bed technique\nwith no water saving capability,\nFigure 1. ISS CDRA in the A R S rack.\nthe process used on board the\nISS employs a 4-bed technique\nthat allows water to be recovered for reuse. The water recovery feature is an important extension of the Skylab\nprocess design and is achieved by separating the zeolite 13X and 5A layers contained in each bed into two distinct\nbeds-a desiccant 5ed a d a C02 adsorption bed. The CDPA, shown schemztical!y and pictorially by Figure 1,\nconsists of 4 adsorbent beds, a blower, an air save pump, and six selector valves. Preconditioned cabin air at its dew\npoint enters the CDRA and flows through the adsorbing desiccant bed to remove additional water. Preconditioning\nthe inlet air reduces the total moisture load and serves to minimize the desiccant bed size. Each desiccant bed\nconsists of 2 layers of zeolite 13X separated by a layer of silica gel (SG). The process air exiting the desiccant bed\ntypically has a dew point ranging from -62 to -73 "C. Upon exiting the desiccant bed, the air enters one of the C 0 2\n\n3\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nI .\n.\n\nr\n\n.\n\nadsorption beds. Each COZadsorption bed contains zeolite 5A. The air exits through the regenerating desiccant\nbed. Exhaust air is directed back to the humidity control system to recover the moisture as condensate. "J\'\nBed regeneration was accomplished on board Skylab using vacuum swing at 15-minute intervals. The capability\nto heat the beds to achieve more thorough regeneration was also provided. Carbon dioxide adsorption bed\nregeneration for the ISS CDRA is accomplished by combined vacudthermal swing at 144-minute intervals.\nDuring regeneration, the carbon dioxide adsorbent bed is evacuated by a pump, heated to 204 "Cy and exposed to\nspace vacuum. The initial evacuation is designed to minimize overboard atmospheric gas losses. Heating the bed\nrequires nearly 1 kW of power. The COz adsorption beds serve as thermal capacitors and heat removed from the\nbeds after regeneration is completed is used to regenerate the desiccant beds. The energy required to recover water\nfrom the desiccant beds is quite significant causing the CDRA to be a power-intensive process. Means to further\nreduce the moisture load entering the CDRA process could serve to reduce its power requirement.\nContamination control on board the ISS is provided by the trace contaminant control system (TCCS). Three\nmain components comprise the TCCS. They are an expendable activated carbon bed, a thermal catalytic oxidizer,\nand an expendable post-sorbent bed. Additionally, the TCCS contains a blower, flow meter, and electrical interface\nassembly. The TCCS has a long development\nToCDbm\nhistory dating to the late 1960s. Its primary\ndesign was first built and tested in the mid-1970s\nand has changed little since. In the ISS TCCS\nprocess design shown schematically by Figure 2,\nprocess air enters the process directly from the\ncabin. Unlike the CDRA, the inlet air is not\nprocessed to remove moisture.

Approximately one-third of the air flows through the thermal catalytic oxidizer and post-sorbent bed\nbefore rejoining the bypass stream just before the system exhaust. Primary components of the thermal catalytic\noxidizer are a recuperative heat exchanger, an electric heater, and a catalyst bed. The catalyst bed contains\napproximately 1 kg of 0.5% palladium (Pd) catalyst supported on alumina pellets."\n3. Atmospheric Gas Storage, Distribution, and Resource Recovery\nThe techniques used to store and supply atmospheric\ngases on board the Shuttle orbiter and ISS rely on either\ncryogenic or high pressure storage with appropriate\nconditioning. The ISSs U.S. On-orbit Segment (USOS)\nwill ultimately include the capability to supply atmospheric\noxygen via water electrolysis. The U.S. oxygen generator\nassembly (OGA) is shown by Figure 3.\'9720 The Russian\nOn-orbit Segment @OS) already possesses this capability.\nWhile tested extensively on the ground, no operational\nspacecraft or space habitat possesses the capability to\nreduce carbon dioxide to achieve minimal overboard water\nlosses. The ISS\'s USOS will include a functional scar to\nDelivery Pump\nenable deploying carbon dioxide reduction equipment on\nFigure 3. Iss oxygen generator assembly r a c k\nboard but no flight hardware developmental work is\nongoing to build that equipment.\n4. Particulate Matter Removal Processes\nParticulate matter control on board the Shuttle orbiter is provided by course filtration with a 280-micron (pm)\nnominal, 3OO-pm absolute rating. This PM control technique is designed to protect equipment from clogging and\nfouling rather than to remove respirable particles that may be a health hazard to humans. Similarly, particulate\nmatter is removed from the ISS cabin atmosphere by mechanical filtration. All process air entering the cabin\nventilation system is filtered. Filter elements are rated 99.97% efficient for 0.3-pm PM. This performance is HEPA\nby defmition. Filter elements typically are replaced every 2 years.\'l\n\n4\n\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\n.\n\n#\n\n.\n\nI I Enabling Capabilities for Exploration\nI.\nAs crewed space exploration mission durations increase and exploration objectives extend beyond low Earth\norbit, improvements are needed to further minimize atmosphere revitalization process equipment mass, power,\nvolume, and logistics requirements. Experience has demonstrated that atmosphere revitalization process\ntechnologies based on adsorption and catalytic oxidation work well; however, process inefficiencies and the\ncontinued reliance on expendable resources present challenges to extending the boundaries of space exploration.\nIdentifying opportunities to attack these inefficiencies leading to a highly efficient, autonomous atmosphere\nrevitalization process equipment design are critical for meeting the challenges presented by the VSE?2\nTo realize the goals established for the VSE, improved open- and closed-system process designs for atmosphere\nrevitalization must be developed. Open-systems employing unit operations for humidity, carbon dioxide, and trace\nVOC control are needed for near-term applications in low Earth orbit (LEO) and transportation between LEO and\nthe Moon. These systems may be a combination of regenerative and non-regenerative processes as influenced by\nmission specifications. Processes utilizing physical adsorption or reversible chemical processes capable of\nregeneration using vacuum and/or temperature swing are leading process technologies. Atmospheric gas storage to\nsupport transportation in LEO or to the Moon will be based on presently understood technologies such as high\npressure and cryogenic storage. The ability to economically fill storage tanks in flight will be needed. Controlling\nPM for transportation applications will also use existing mechanical filtration techniques.\nShort-duration lunar surface exploration can initially use exploration vehicle-derived systems. Controlling\nparticulate matter becomes more difficult as soil and dust from extravehicular activity (EVA) becomes an issue. A\nvariety of inertial separation, electrostatic, HEPA, and ultra-low particulate air (ULPA) filtration techniques will\nneed to be developed to protect the crew, the surface habitat, and equipment from the dust and debris. Developing\nthe means for high-pressure oxygen generation combined with the ability to refill storage tanks for exploration\nvehicle systems becomes important.\nLong\nduration\nmissions,\nincluding Mars transit and vicinity\noperations, require a closed ECLS\nsystem design illustrated by Figure\n4. Functional areas are shown and\nin this concept there is opportunity\nfor improvement.\nNotice that\nbyproducts are vented from the C02\nreduction function.\nTo achieve\nmaximum process closure, efforts\nmust be made to find a use for these\nbyproducts or develop process\ntechnologies suitable for recovering\nthe byproducts. To realize such an\nachievement requires an end-to-end,\nintegrated process design approach.\nFigure 4. ECLS process functions.\nThe\nresulting\natmosphere\nrevitalization process must remove\ntrace VOCs and carbon dioxide, reduce the carbon dioxide, and limit overboard water losses to those attributed only\nto overboard atmospheric leakage and concentrated process wastes. Process designs based on regenerable\nadsorption, thermal oxidation, and thermal reduction processes are the most viable candidates.\nIV. Developmental Approach for Candidate Process Technologies\nA variety of process technologies will be pursued initially to address immediate process technology performance\ndeficiencies. Given that the scope of the VSE spans short duration missions to the ISS as well as lunar surface\nexploration and beyond, the process technologies selected for development must address a wide range of challenges.\nbxpenence gained fiom past space expioration programs and opportuniries IO ieverage exisiing procebs ieclu~oiogies\nfor meeting the VSE goals will be considered as appropriate. Already, the atmosphere revitalization process\nequipment designs in use on board the ISS have provided a wealth of information and operational experience that\ncan lead to improvements in ECLS system logistics support as well as process equipment robustness and\ncomplexity.23\n5\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nA. Unit Operations as a Developmental Basis\nA functional approach using the concept of unit operations serves as the basis for process technology selection\nand process de~ign.2~\nUsing the concept of unit operations breaks the overall atmosphere revitalization process\ndesign into smaller processing steps that are more easily characterized individually for ultimate integrati~n.\xe2\x80\x99~\nSystematically evaluating and developing each unit operation that is common to all VSE process design\nembodiments simplifies the challenge of developing an end-to-end atmosphere revitalization process design that\naddresses past and present inefficiencies associated with mass, power, volume, logistics support, and operational\nautonomy. Implementing robust design principles as a guiding technique for optimization at both the unit operation\nand atmosphere revitalization process levels is at imperative to achieve success. Traditional compartmentalized\ndesign approaches that produce parallel processing trains for each function will not achieve the desired result. A\nfunctional, unit operations approach allows interaction between processing steps to be understood via rigorous\nengineering analysis and targeted testing. Modular process designs that can be more rapidly adapted to changing\nexploration objectives and goals may also result. The principle atmosphererevitalization functions to be addressed\nas unit operations for near-term VSE objectives include the following:\n1) Process gas drying\n2) Carbon dioxide removal\n3) Trace chemical contaminantremoval\n4) Particulate matter removal\n5 ) Atmospheric gas storage\n6 ) Atmospheric gas distribution\n7) Atmospheric gas conditioning\nTo extend human presence beyond low Earth orbit for extended periods to establish a permanent human\npresence throughout the solar system as specified by the VSE, these unit operations must be supplemented by the\nfollowing:\n1) Atmospheric gas generation with high pressure capability\n2) Resource recovery\n3) In-situ resource utilization\n\nB. Candidate Process Technologies for Selected Unit Operations\nCandidate process technologies must address specific weaknesses of the atmosphere revitalization unit\noperations as presently understood. Integrating the unit operations into an overall, efficient atmosphere\nrevitalization process design uses the knowledge and operational experience acquired via developmental projects.\nThe developmental projects are selected based on criteria that include technological relevance, risk reduction\npotential, and return on investment.26 All efforts are made to avoid relying excessively on technology readiness\nlevel (TRL)as a driving project selection criterion as has been the practice for more recent space exploration\nprograms such as ISS.27 Developmental project performance is measured relative to metrics that are based on VSE\napplications. The project performance metrics serve to guide decisions on adding, retaining, or terminating\nindividual projects. Process technology developmental areas being pursued to address various process inefficiencies\nand to meet the challenges set forth by the VSE are the following:\nProcess gas drying-membrane-based process technologies.\xe2\x80\x9d\nCarbon dioxide removal-improved chemisorbent media, improved physical adsorption media, novel\nadsorbent media substrates and bed packing geometries, vacuum swing adsorption processes, combined\nvacudtemperature swing adsorption processes, reversible reactive processes.29-31\nTrace chemical contaminant removal-regenerable adsorption media, novel adsorbent media substrates\nand bed packing geometries, improved thermal oxidation reaction designs, novel catalyst substrates and\n-37\nreactor geometries, highly efficient recuperative heat exchanger designs.32\nParticulate matter removal-inertial separation (10-pm), electrically-enhanced filtration (<O. 1-p),\nelectrostatic precipitation (<O. 1-pm), and HEPA filtration (0.3-pm) system designs.\nAtmospheric gas storage, distribution, and conditioning-storage tank recharging equipment; high\nprcssiie, CiyGgeiiiiiC, i z d szpe:cticz! stcrzge.\nAtmospheric gas generation-high pressure oxygen production via water electrolysis\nResource recovery and use-carbon dioxide reduction processes to carbon product, in-situ resource\nutilization.\nSupporting infrastructure-improved blowers, valves, and process monitoring and control\ninstrumentation.\n6\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\n.. .\n\nAll process technology integration will\ns p vanrm\nemploy well-developed robust design practices to\nproduce the greatest end-to-end process\nFmmabm\nTo Cabm\nperformance and operational efficiencies.

Basic Design Requirements\nBasic design requirements relating to atmosphere revitalization for the Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV) and the\nLunar Surface Ascent Module (LSAM) are derived from early exploration architectural documents. Detailed\nrequirements are under development. Available requirements of interest to atmosphere revitalization process\ndesigners are summarized by Table 2.

Timetable for Development\nThe timetable for addressing the challenges presented by the VSE is aggressive. Retiring the Shuttle orbiter by\n2010 drives the inherent urgency with the timetable. Parallel efforts to achieve the VSE goals are the following:\n1) Return the Shuttle orbiter to flight status and move toward retirement after ISS assembly is completed\n2) Complete ISS assembly by 2010 and focus research on crew health risks and countermeasures\n3) Develop the Shuttle orbiter\xe2\x80\x99s replacement with first risk reduction flight in 20 11\n4) Develop enabling infrastructure for lunar surface exploration and sustained exploration missions\nTo meet the aggressive developmental timetable, process technologies for application to the Crew Exploration\nVehicle (CEV) are the first priority. The objective is to characterize several process technologies that will constitute\nthe core unit operations of the atmosphere revitalization system by the CEV preliminary design review scheduled for\n2007. Candidate process technologies include reversible reactive and physical adsorption C02 removal combined\nwith moisture removal and trace chemical contaminant control process steps. Most of these process technology\ndevelopmentefforts will benefit greatly from experience gained from the Shuttle orbiter and ISS programs as well as\nthe lessons leamed during Skylab. The core atmosphere revitalization process design resulting from the\ndevelopmental effort will be suitable for adaptation to lunar sortie and long-term VSE goals to achieve an expanded\nhuman presence in the solar system.\n\nV.\n\nSummary\n\nThe result.from a process technology developmental effort based on a functional, unit operation approach is an\nenergy and volume efficient cabin atmosphere revitalization process that is highly reliable and easily maintained.\nAttention to robust design principle$ lead to stage-wise optimization that addresses top level performance\nconsiderations to yield the most efficient process design. By developing a more efficient end-to-end process design,\nredundancy can be better addressed using multiple process strings. As well, a well-designed, modular atmosphere\nrevitalization process built around core process technologies can be easily modified by adding other unit operations\nto recover resources thus moving toward ECLS system closure to build a solid platform to expand human presence\nin the solar system. Such a closed-system design will fully enable the most challengingVSE goals.\n\nVI.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe NASA possesses an extensive working historical and operational knowledge base from which the next\ngeneration of atmosphere revitalization process designs will benefit. Given the urgency to deliver process\ntechnology products to new space exploration vehicle programs, leveraging experience gained during the design,\ndevelopment, and operation of the process equipment on board the Shuttle orbiter and the ISS is vital to successfully\nmeeting the challenges presented by the VSE. These challenges can be addressed by implementing a functional,\nunit operations-driven approach to core process technology identification, selection, and characterization as well as\nusing robust design principles to optimize the end-to-end process.\n\nReferences\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98The Vision for Space Exploration,\xe2\x80\x9d NASA, NP-2004-01-334-HQ, February 2004.\n\xe2\x80\x99Dimant, B.L. and Humphries, W.R, \xe2\x80\x9cPast and Present Environmental Control and Life Support Systems on Manned\nSpacecraft,\xe2\x80\x9d Society of Automotive Engineers, 901210, 1990.\n\xe2\x80\x99Wieland, P.O., \xe2\x80\x9cLiving Together in Space-The Design and Operation of the Life Support Systems on the International\nSpace Station,\xe2\x80\x9d NASAiTM-206956, Vol. 1., January 1998.\n4Wieland, P.O.: \xe2\x80\x9cDesigning for Human Presence in Space-An Introduction to Environmental Control and Life Support\nSystems,\xe2\x80\x9d NASA RP-1324, 1994.\n\xe2\x80\x99Martin, C.E., \xe2\x80\x9cEnvironmental Control and Life Support System Historical Data Summary-Apollo through Space Station\nFreedom,\xe2\x80\x9d McDonnell Douglas Space Systems Co., MDC 92W5038, December 1992.\n6Wieland, P.O., \xe2\x80\x9cDesigning for Human Presence in Spade: An Introduction to Environmental Control and Life Support\nSystems.
