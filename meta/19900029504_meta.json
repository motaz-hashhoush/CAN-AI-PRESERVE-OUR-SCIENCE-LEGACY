By using high-specific-impulse (lsp) electric propulsion systems with advanced nuclear reactors, the total mass-to-orbit for a series of manned Mars flight is reduced. Propulsion technologies required for the manned Mars mission are described. Multi-megawatt Ion and Magneto-Plasma-Dynamic (MPD) propulsion thrusters, Power-Processing Units and nuclear power source are needed. Xenon (Xe)-Ion and MPD thruster performance are detailed. Mission analyses for several Mars mission options are addressed. Both MPD and Ion propulsion were investigated. A four-megawatt propulsion system power level was assumed. Mass comparisons for all-chemical oxygen/hydrogen propulsion missions and combined chemical and nuclear-electric propulsion Mars fleets are included. With fleets of small nuclear-electric vehicles, short trip times to Mars are also enabled.", "title": "Nuclear-electric propulsion - Manned Mars propulsion options", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PROCEEDINGS", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-14T09:54:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19900029504, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Palaszewski, Bryan"}, "organization": {"name": "Jet Propulsion Lab., California Inst. of Tech.", "location": "Pasadena, CA, United States"}}, "id": "ae0cfa2bae2246f3982f4498e267b52e"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19900029504, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Brophy, John"}, "organization": {"name": "Jet Propulsion Lab., California Inst. of Tech.", "location": "Pasadena, CA, United States"}}, "id": "c8a9e08b56b740eaa19662f76622a05b"}, {"sequence": 2, "submissionId": 19900029504, "meta": {"author": {"name": "King, David"}, "organization": {"name": "JPL", "location": "Pasadena, CA, United States"}}, "id": "472d3f4ff064452a82bced8b3fcdd2b0"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Proceedings", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-18T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19900029504, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19900029504, "id": "51e24a3b5f0d477687103d340b55b557", "publicationDate": "1989-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
