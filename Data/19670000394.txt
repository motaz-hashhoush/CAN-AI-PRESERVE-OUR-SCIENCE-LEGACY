The thermal\nand strength properties of particulate materials have\nbeen studied for over 100 years. In particular, the\neffects of heat transport through powders at reduced\npressures laid the groundwork for subsequent theoretical and experimental studies of high efficiency thermal insulations and the means to improve them.\nDetailed information on the behavior of particulate\nmaterials would provide additional information on the\nphysical properties of possible cometary materials,\nand the behavior of particles in other planetary environments.\nA study was initiated to establish the feasibility of\ncharacterizing the state of agglomeration and the\nmacroscopic behavior in reduced gravity fields of\nparticles of known physical characteristics by measuring and correlating the thermal and acoustical\nproperties of particulate materials. On earth, the\neffects of gravity on the properties of an ensemble\nof particles overrides other interactions except under\ncarefully controlled and severely limited conditions.\nBased upon theoretical predictions of the magnitude\nof these interactions, it is not possible to assume that\nthe properties of bulk particles measured in the earth's\ngravity field will be the same as in a reduced or near\nzero gravity environment.\nExperimental procedures were evaluated (1) to provide a phenomenological basis for the development\nof a theory to describe particle behavior, (2) to measure the bulk properties of particulate materials in\nreduced gravity, (3) to use in the design and engineering application of particulate materials, and (4)\n\nto further the understanding of particulate material\nbehavior in planetary and cometary environments.\nThe heat transfer mechanisms, which operate simultaneously and interact with each other, are not easily\nidentified. Consequently, the thermal conductivity of\npowders has not been completely defined analytically\nin terms of the important variables, such as the temperature of the boundary walls, the particle shape\nand arrangement, density, physical properties of the\nsolid, and interparticle forces. One of the major obstacles to such a definition is the degree to which\nthermal resistance controls the heat flow across contacts between individual particles. Efforts to improve\nthe thermal effectiveness of evacuated powder materials have resulted in intensified research to establish\nthe various physical phenomena occurring at contact\npoints and in defining the radiation across the void\nspaces.\nUsing the results of these extensive investigations\nof the physical properties of powders, the possibility\nhas been examined of designing space experiments\nthat will yield useful information about the behavior\nof particulate materials under reduced gravity conditions. In previous studies, it has been shown that\nshort time simulation experiments are insufficient to\ncomplete the measurements. Even with more sophisticated experimental apparatus, constraints on the\nexperiment and uncontrollable environmental effects,\nsuch as residual accelerations, prevent meaningful\nsimulation. Only long term experiments carried out\nin a manned space laboratory will achieve the desired\nexperimental conditions. In a manned space laboratory, experimental conditions can be controlled, experiments can be adjusted immediately, and the results\ncan be evaluated quickly.\n(continued overleaf)\n\nThis document was prepared under the sponsorship of the National\nAeronautics and Space Administration.
