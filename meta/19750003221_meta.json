The present capability is limited to five Loran-C chains in which the tolerance is twenty-five microseconds with respect to UTC. Upon completion of the program, the transmissions of all Loran-C chains will be maintained within five microseconds of UTC. The improvement plan consists of equipping selected Loran-C transmitting stations for greater precision of frequency standard adjustment and improved monitoring capability. External time monitor stations will utilize television time transfer techniques with nearby SATCOM terminals where practicable, thus providing the requisite traceability to the Naval Observatory. The monitor equipment groups and the interrelationships with the ground station equipment are discussed. After a brief review of control doctrine, forth-coming improvements to transmitting stations and how the time monitor and navigation equipments will complement each other resulting in improved service to all users of the Loran-C system are described.", "title": "All chain Loran-C time synchronization", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-08T06:13:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19750003221, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Sherman, H.
