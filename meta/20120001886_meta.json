While it might be obvious why these materials would not make for safe space travel, they do share a common characteristic with materials that may well be the future foundation of spacecraft design: They all are composites. Formed of two or more unlike materials - such as cellulose and lignin in the case of wood, or glass fibers and plastic resin in the case of fiberglass-composites provide enhanced mechanical and physical properties through the combination of their constituent materials. For this reason, composites are used in everything from buildings, bathtubs, and countertops to boats, racecars, and sports equipment. NASA continually works to develop new materials to enable future space missions - lighter, less expensive materials that can still withstand the extreme demands of space travel. Composites such as carbon fiber materials offer promising solutions in this regard, providing strength and stiffness comparable to metals like aluminum but with less weight, allowing for benefits like better fuel efficiency and simpler propulsion system design. Composites can also be made fatigue tolerant and thermally stable - useful in space where temperatures can swing hundreds of degrees. NASA has recently explored the use of composites for aerospace applications through projects like the Composite Crew Module (CCM), a composite-constructed version of the aluminum-lithium Multipurpose Crew Capsule. The CCM was designed to give NASA engineers a chance to gain valuable experience developing and testing composite aerospace structures.", "title": "Custom Machines Advance Composite Manufacturing", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-25T19:45:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2012-02-15T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20120001886, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20120001886, "id": "a301254043e94c72a229aff87e118250", "publicationName": "Spinoff 2011", "publicationDate": "2012-02-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 20120001873, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "Spinoff 2011", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20120001886.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20120001886/downloads/20120001886.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20120001886/downloads/20120001886.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20120001886/downloads/20120001886.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
