(MTI) of Latham, N.Y., to develop the Stirling engine\nfor passenger cars.\n\nThe contract, awarded through NASA, provides for a major\nreview and assessment at the ^end of 18 months.\n\nMaximum value\n\nof the contract which could run seven and one-half years is\n$95 million.\n\n-moreMailed:\n_March_2_7_. .1978\nN78-7UU66\n\n(NASA-News-Belease-78-U8) NASA, DOE AWABD\nCONTRACT FOE STIRLING ENGINE DEVELOPMENT\n(National Aeronautics and Space\nAdministration) U p\n00/4U\n\nDnclas\n11,038\n\n-2This is the second Stirling engine development contract\nfunded as part of DOE's effort to develop alternative automobile engine systems.\n\nThe first was signed with the Ford\n\nMotor Co. last September.\n\nThe two competitive engine development teams, MTI and\nFord, together with various engine technology development\ncontractors and the Stirling Engine Project Office at NASAfs\nLewis Research Center, Cleveland, Ohio, make up the DOE\nStirling Engine Development Program.\n\nLewis Center provides\n\nproject management for the DOE program and conducts supporting\nin-house research.\n\nThe contract with MTI calls for development of a complete\nStirling engine system, engine performance data and production cost information that are needed by the automobile\nindustry so that it can determine the feasibility of putting\nthe engine into commercial production.\n\nOther members of the\n\nteam led by MTI are United Stirling of Sweden (USS), Malmo,\nSweden; and AM General, a wholly owned subsidiary of American\nMotors Corp., Detroit, Mich.\n\nThe Stirling engine has the potential of providing high\nfuel efficiency, flexibility of choice of fuels, inherently\nlow noise and pollution emissions\ncharacteristics.\n\n-more-\n\nand good driving\n\n-3-\n\nA Stirling-powered automobile is expected to be at\nleast 30 per cent more fuel efficient than current vehicles\nyet give similar road performance.\n\nPotentially the Stirling\n\ncycle could be even more efficient as technical improvements\nare made.\n\nUnder the MTI contract, three generations of Stirling\nengines are to be developed and tested.\n\nP*\nThe baseline engine, .\n\ndeveloped earlier by USS, serves as the proven hardware\nstarting point on which the fuel economy, performance, reliability and weight and cost improvements are to be made,\ndemonstrated and documented.\n\nApproximately half the contract funds will be paid to\nMTI, which is responsible for program management and business\ndevelopment, technology transfer, component and analytical\ntool development and licensing.\n\nUSS is responsible for\n\ndeveloping and supplying engines and components for test and\nevaluation and will receive about one-third of the contract\nfunds.\n\nThe balance will go to AM General and others.\n\nAM\n\nGeneral is responsible for engine-vehicle integration, test\nand evaluation, auto marketing and compiling trend information\n\n-more-\n\n-4-\n\nThe contract calls for transfer of Stirling engine\ntechnology to a U.S. engine manufacturer and for royalties\nto be paid to the U.S. Government until two and one-fourth\ntimes the contract costs have been recovered.\n\n-end-\n\n"
