Havemann\'s Dissertation and\nR. Fults\' Masters Thesis, both to be published in May 1974.\nHowever, at least two papers, one on the MOM detection theory\nand another on the SIM microwave diode performance prediction\ntechnique, should be finished by the end of this year.\n\nSince\n\ndetailed results will be published as technical papers, this\nreport will summarize the directions this research has taken\nand the conclusions that have evolved.\nFor many years, the dominant detection mechanism for MOM\ndetectors has been attributed to a difference in contact\n\n2\n\npotential first analyzed correctly by Simmons\n\n(1-5)\n\nBased on\n\nthe tunneling theory of Stratton(6) and Simmons, Coleman and\nGreen\n\n(7 )\n\ndeveloped a theory which explained zero bias detecIf the two metals on either side of\n\ntion in a MOM junction.\n\nthe tunneling barrier have different contact potentials, an\neffective bias (but no DC current or associated shot noise)\nis produced which introduces an asymmetry in the currentvoltage relationship.\n\nAccording to Coleman and Green, this\n\nasymmetry suffices to explain the observed responsivity (volts\noutput per watt input) regardless of frequency, at least until\nthe reactance of the junction becomes important.\n\nThus, if it\n\nwere possible to trace a typical MOM I-V curve at, say, microwave frequencies, the curve should be identical with the low\nfrequency (DC) characteristic.\n\nHowever, even allowing for the\n\neffective bias of the MOM detector, the observed low frequency\nMOM I-V curves are far less nonlinear than their SIM counterparts of comparable responsivity as shown in Figure 1.\nBased upon this apparent anomaly, the following explanations could be proposed:\n(1) High frequency detector behavior cannot\nbe predicted from low frequency I-V curves;\n(2) A detection mechanism is present which is\neither frequency dependent and/or does\nnot appear in I-V curves at any frequency.\nThe first goal of this research was to verify that the\nhigh frequency (microwave) performance of a SIM detector\ncould be predicted from the low frequency (~DC) I-V curves.\n\n3\n\n0.5\n\nmilliamps\nper\n\nP\n_\n\n_\n\ndivision\n\nMe al-M tal\n\n0.2 Volts/division\n\nFigure 1.\n\nComparison of SIM and MOM I-V Characteristics\n\n4\n\nIf this could be shown, then it would be implausible to expect\na frequency independent effect such as a difference in contact\npotential to be the sole detection mechanism, since the responsivities inferred from the curves of Figure 1 could not possibly\nbe the same, even allowing for the "effective bias" of the MOM\njunction.\n\nWith this objective in mind, a technique was developed\n\nwhich accurately predicts the performance of a SIM microwave\nvideo detector and heterodyne mixer strictly from the DC characteristics of the diode.\nIn order to explain the theory behind this technique,\nconsider the following Maclaurin series expansion of the current\ni as a function of voltage v:\ni(v) = Av + Bv 2 + Cv 3 + Dv\n\n+ Ev\n\n+ Fv\n\n+ ...\n\n(1)\n\nEarlier authors(7) have shown that the responsivity of a squarelaw video detector can be determined from the first two coefficients in the above expansion.\n\nNote that A and B may be deter-\n\nmined directly from the diode I-V curve since A corresponds to\nthe slope at the origin and B is proportional to the second\nderivative at the origin.\n\nHowever, higher order terms are neces-\n\nsary to correctly describe behavior for departures from square-law\noperation.\n\nIndeed, beyond the square-law region the first two\n\ncoefficients indicate a behavior decidedly opposite experimental\nobservation.\nConsequently the circuit of Figure 2 was constructed using\nanalog multiplier circuits to simulate an I-V curve according\nto Equation (1).\n\nBy matching the true diode I-V characteristics.\n\nDiode Voltage\nTo Horiz.

time.\n\nAn approximate calculation of the open circuit\n\nvoltage agrees with experimental observations.\n\nAs has been men-\n\ntioned, a detailed presentation of this theory will be submitted\nfor publication by the end of this year.\n\nWhat follows is a\n\ngeneral description of the theory and its consequences.\nSpecifically, it can be shown that when conductor geometry\nconstrains internal AC fields to have significant spatial gradients over one mean free path, then the strictly linear relation\nbetween current density and electric field given by Ohm\'s law\n(J=aE) is no longer valid.\n\nRather, the current density should\n\nbe calculated from the expanded distribution function that is\ndependent both on orders of the applied AC electric field and\nspatial gradients of the distribution function.\nquencies (Tr<<l)\n\nAt low fre-\n\nthe Boltzmann transport equation for the elec-\n\ntron distribution function f(2,k ,t)\n\nmay be written\n\nf-f\n*~V f\n\n+ FVk f

time\n\n13\n\ndependent electric field E, and the relaxation time T was\nassumed to be constant.\nAn approximate solution to the Boltzmann equation was\nobtained by using a double perturbation technique in which the\ndistribution function f was perturbed by the electric field\namplitude and spatial gradients of f.\n\nTo second order in E and\n\nto first order in spatial gradients of f, the solution of Boltzmann\'s equation yields the following result for current density:\n2\net a {3E(V.E)\n- m\n\nj =\n\n(8)\n\n+ 2(E*V)E}\n\nwhere\n=\n\nThe first\nlaw.\n\n1\n\n2\n\ne\n\nm\n\nk 3 =

electric field configuration shown\nin Figure 6.\n\nThis geometry represents an idealized approximation\n\nto a typical MOM device.\n\nIn many cases the whisker diameter will\n\nbe of the order of one mean free path or less, and the radius of\ncurvature of the electric field will be significant over a distance of one mean path.\n\nUnder these circumstances, electrons\n\ncannot follow the electric field, that is, Ohm\'s law no longer\nyields the correct current density and, to a first approximation,\nequation (8) must be used to calculate J.\n\nAt greater power levels\n\n(stronger E fields), higher order approximations would be necessary, but equation (8) should be valid for power levels corresponding to square-law operation.\n\n14\n\nD\n\n--\n\nMetal Whisker\n\nOxide Tunneling Barrier\n1--\n\nMetal\nP2\n\n*Pi\n\'t 1\n\nFigure 6.\n\nIdealized Detector Electric Field Configuration\n\n15\n\nSince electrons cannot follow a field whose radius of\ncurvature is comparable to one electron mean free path,\nheuristically one would expect an asymmetry in the J vs. E\nrelationship for the field configuration shown in Figure 6.\nIndeed, electrons do not need to follow the field in the substrate in order to tunnel out of the whisker into the substrate.\nSimilarly, an electron at P1 should be able to follow the field\ntowards the whisker and be in a position to tunnel back into\nthe whisker.\n\nHowever, the path of an electron at point P\n2\nwill have to curve appreciably within one mean free path or\nthe electron will miss the barrier completely and be reflected\nfrom the surface of the substrate.\n\nThe dashed line in Figure 6\n\nillustrates the path an electron at P 2 might follow if the AC\nelectric field curvature is too stringent.\n\nThus a DC current,\n\nor net flow of electrons out of the whisker, would be.expected.\nFor an AC electric field, this DC current is readily obtained\nfrom the second term of Equation (8).\n\nNote that in general,\n\na DC current will be induced by either curvature of the AC\nfield within one mean free path or by the divergence of an AC\nfield.\n\nHowever, in each case a component of DC current will be\n\nperpendicular to the barrier.\nIn order to ascertain whether or not this geometric\neffect could contribute significantly to MOM detection, an\norder of magnitude calculation of the short-circuit current\nwas performed.\n\nA 50\n\ncoaxial line supporting l\n\nWatt of rf\n\npower was assumed to be terminated by a MOM detector operating\ninto an open circuit.\n\nIf the radius of curvature of electric\n\n16\n\nfield is assumed comparable to a whisker diameter of 500 1,\nthen a current of approximately lp amp flows across the\njunction.\nThe open circuit voltage may be inferred from the shortcircuit current by utilizing the linearized tunneling equations of Simmons in the limit of small voltage and current.\nThe high (rf) frequency I-V curve at the external terminals\ncan be viewed as a DC I-V curve which has been shifted according to Figure 7.\n\nIn the vicinity of the origin over which\n\nthis approximation is valid, the slope of the I-V curve is\nessentially constant (no curvature) and equal to\nRT is the tunneling resistance.\n\n1 /RT,\n\nwhere\n\nHowever, since a geometrically-\n\ninduced current has been shown to flow under short-circuit (V=0)\nconditions, then conversely a voltage must exist across the\ndevice under open-circuit (I=0) conditions.\n\nThe open-circuit\n\nvoltage can be determined from the short-circuit current and\nslope (1/RT) in the vicinity of the origin.\n\nIn a typical MOM\n\ndetector, the tunneling resistance is of the order of 1K ohm.\nUsing the value of short-circuit current calculated previously\n(1p amp),\n\nan open-circuit voltage of lm Volt is predicted.\n\nThus, the equivalent detectivity of this device is 1000 Volts/Watt.\n\nAlthough this model is a rather naive one, it does serve\n\nto illustrate the significance and pertinence of geometricallyinduced detection.\n\nThe precise nature of the high frequency I-V\n\ncurve must, of course, be determined by incorporating the geometric effect into Simmon\'s original tunneling theory.\n\nThis\n\ncalculation is presently near completion and will be published\nat a later date.\n\n17\n\nCurrent\n(pA)\n\n5\n4\n-3\n-2\n1\n\nI\n-5\n\n-4\n\nII\n-3\n\nI\n-2\n\nI\n\nVoltage\n15\n\n-1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n-1\n\n- - , -2\n-2\n-3\n\n-4\n-5\n\nFigure 7.\n\nHypothetical High (Microwave) Frequency I-V Curve\n\n(mV)\n\n18\n\nSeveral remarks should be mad e regarding the nature of\ngeometrically-induced rectification.\n\nFirst, since the recti-\n\nfied current does not strictly follow the AC field, but obeys\nthe vector relations shown in the second term of equation (8),\none would not necessarily expect the geometric effect to\nappear in low or high frequency I-V traces.\n\nActually, the\n\nsituation-is more complex than can be described by the shortcircuit current "order of magnitude" calculation above since\nthe tunneling barrier cannot be ignored.\n\nThe I-V relation\n\nwhich includes geometric effects is currently being derived\nfrom Simmon\'s original tunneling theory.\n\nAt this time, it\n\nappears that geometric effects can be related to an effective\ntunneling resistance, but the calculations are not yet complete.\nSecondly, it should be noted that geometrically-induced\nrectification or detection can be enhanced by at least three\nmethods:\n(1) Increasing the frequency of operation\nuntil skin effect constraints force\ngreater field curvature;\n(2) Designing conductor geometry such that\nAC electric fields are constrained to\nhave significant spatial gradients over\none mean free path;\n(3) Increasing the mean free path of an\nelectron in the metal, thereby increasing the "effective electric field curvature".\n\n19\n\nNote that in each case the emphasis is upon increasing the\neffective electric field curvature over distances of one\nelectron mean free path.\n\nConductor geometries having sharp\n\ncorners are therefore highly desirable.\n\nAt microwave fre-\n\nquencies, the skin depth effect has only a small influence\non field curvature over a distance of one mean free path,\nbut skin effects could be significant at higher (infrared)\nfrequencies.\n\nOne obvious way of forcing electric field\n\ncurvature to be significant over one mean free path is to\nuse a thin film substrate with thickness on the order of a\nmean free path.\n\nPower dissipation might be a problem here,\n\nbut non-conducting heat sinks\n\n(synthetic diamond, for example)\n\nare available and have been used in other devices.\n\nOf course\n\noptimum detection at any frequency or geometry will occur at\ncryogenic temperatures, since the electron mean free path will\nbe longer and the "effective electric field curvature" will\ntherefore be greater.\n\nIt is felt that once the analysis is\n\ncomplete and the detection mechanism is understood, mechanically\nstable detectors can be designed for optimum detection by\nutilizing the above techniques to enhance geometrically-induced\nrectification.\nAlthough much of this work is still in the theoretical\nstate, considerable experimental effort has been concurrently\ndevoted to the problem of fabricating a mechanically stable\nMOM detector.\n\nOne configuration, illustrated in Figure 8, has\n\nproduced some very encouraging results.\n\n20\n\nConducting Paint\n\nTungsten Whisker\n\nPlastic Filler\n\n4\n\nHypodermic Needle Casing\n\n1/16" diameter\nstainless steel\npost\n\nFigure 8.\n\nPrototype for Mechanically Stable MOM Detector\n\n21\n\nA small diameter (less than 0.001 inch) tungsten wire\nis welded to a 1/16 inch diameter stainless steel post and\nthe wire is electrolytically pointed.\n\nThe whisker and post\n\nare then inserted inside a section of hypodermic tubing and\na liquid plastic material is injected so as to completely\nenclose the whisker tip.\n\nAfter the plastic has hardened,\n\nthe right-hand end of the unit is polished until just the\ntip of the whisker is exposed.\n\nThe entire end is then covered\n\nwith a small drop of silver conducting paint.\n\nWhen RF energy\n\nis applied to the resulting coaxial structure, detection does\noccur.\n\nThe mechanical stability is excellent but the detec-\n\ntivity is low since the dominant detection mechanism for this\ngeometry is the difference in contact potential between the\ntwo metals.\n\nSeveral thin film designs which utilize geometri-\n\ncally-induced rectification as the dominant detection mechanism\nare presently being considered as possible prototypes for\nfuture devices.\n\nRefinements of these designs are awaiting the\n\ncompletion of the theoretical analysis of geometrically-induced\nrectification as applied to a tunneling junction.\nIn summary, the detection of electromagnetic radiation\nby a metal-oxide-metal tunneling junction can be attributed to\ntwo mechanisms -- a difference in contact potential between\n\nthe two metals and a geometrically-induced rectification.\n\nAdapta-\n\ntion of the theory of geometrically-induced rectification to a\ntunneling junction is still in progress, but a paper will be\nwritten containing a detailed analysis of this effect upon completion of the necessary calculations.\n\nOnce theoretical studies\n\n22\n\nare finished, work will continue on the problem of designing\na mechanically stable MOM detector with high responsivity.\nIn addition, a paper on the technique of predicting video\ndetector and heterodyne mixer SIM diode performance from DC\ncharacteristics is also in progress.\n\nThese papers will be\n\nsubsequently submitted as appendices to this report.\n\nThe\n\nfinal detailed summary of this research will be contained in\nR.
