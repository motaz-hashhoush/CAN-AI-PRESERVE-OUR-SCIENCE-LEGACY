The device utilizes Freon 21 as the heat\ntransport fluid, and either R22 or water for the expendable evaporant consistent with projected space shuttle orbiter systems and mission operating phases.\nThe evaporants are pulse-sprayed by on-off control onto the walls of a chamber\nformed by heat transfer surfaces which contain the Freon 21 transport fluid.\nThe vaporized water or R-22 is exhausted to external vacuum or atmospheric\nsurroundings through a fixed size exit. The objectives of this phase of the\nprogram were the design, fabrication, and testing of a preliminary laboratory\nprototype flight configuration evaporator which can meet the space shuttle\norbiter performance requirements.\nA side-by-side, multi-parallel rectangular transport fluid tube design\nwas selected for the evaporator heat transfer surface. Active and redundant\nheat transport system tubes are interspersed and brazed together to provide\nan optimum weight design, and performance which avoids cold spots. The heat\ntransfer surface of 6ft2 for a nominal 50,000 BTU/hr capability was fabricated\nin a cylindrical configuration (Figure 11 - page 21) to provide even evaporant\nspray deposition, and thus maximum evaporant utilization. The evaporant inflow\nvalve/nozzle was designed to prevent freezing on or near the nozzle in the\nvacuum environment. This was accomplished by minimizing the liquid holdup\nvolume, providing heat from the transport fluid, and providing a smooth surface\nto which ice cannot adhere.\nAn on/off temperature switched method of evaporant pulsing for temperature control of the transport fluid was selected over a feedback control method\ndue to simplicity and cost considerations. Extensive thermal analyses were\nconducted to determine the optimum location of the temperature sensor. A\nsensor located on the evaporator wall just upstream of the transport fluid\nexit was selected over a wall mounted or immersion sensor located at the exit\nsince this provides tighter control over fluid temperature, and a common\nsensor can be utilized by both primary and redundant fluid transport systems.\nIt was also found that different sensor locations are necessary for the water\nand R-22 evaporants due to differences in spray deposition in the evaporator.\nAn extensive five week test program was conducted to verify the evaporator\ndesign and to demonstrate the capabilities of the device to meet projected\nshuttle requirements. Thermal control of the transport fluid at 40\xc2\xb0 +_ 5\xc2\xb0F by\nspray pulsing was generally obtained. It was found that the sensor location\nhowever, is sensitive to the nozzle spray pattern. Repeated dormant to active\noperation was demonstrated with no start up constraints. High evaporative\nefficiences were obtained during operation: 95% for water and 99% for R-22.\nThe margin on the evaporative.side/temperature was shown to be larger than previously\ndemonstrated. During previous feasibility testing, (Reference 1), outlet\ntemperatures to 34\xc2\xb0F were produced, while in this prototype testing,\nthe\noutlet temperature was brought deliberately as low as 30\xc2\xb0F before any inefficiency was realized.\n\nDuring early phases of the test program ice was formed near the water\nnozzle because of insulating surfaces placed adjacent to it. These were installed to prevent possible freezing of the water inflow valve during operation\nwith R-22. It was later determined that they were not required, and no nozzle\nfreezing was observed after removal of insulating surfaces from the evaporator.\nFrost formation on .the walls of the spray chamber was observed with some nozzles\ndue to combinations of large droplets and locally dense spray patterns. Further\noptimization of nozzle spray patterns and drop size is planned for the next\ndevelopment phase.\nOperational characteristics of the evaporator with simulated shuttle\nheat rejection cycles were also determined. No performance degradation was\nnoted during evaporator operation with: 1) various combinations of active and\nredundant evaporant and transport systems; 2) different evaporator orientations\n(up, down, horizontal); 3) variation of evaporant supply pressure; 4) variation\nof transport fluid flow rate; or 5) variation in ambient pressure (with the\nR-22 evaporant). Variation in evaporant supply temperature did, however, result in slight changes in performance due to the temperature effects on\nevaporant properties which changes the spray droplet size and spatial distribution.\nThe laboratory flash evaporator heat sink designed, fabricated, and\ntested met the requirements and objectives of the study.\n\nla\n\n2.0 INTRODUCTION\n\nThe thermal control system for the shuttle is being projected\nto include an expendable heat sink to provide primary heat rejection during\nreentry and atmospheric flight phases, and to augment the radiator system\nduring the orbital operation. For orbital operation, the use of water,\ngenerated by the auxiliary power system, is desirable since it does not represent a launch weight penalty to the expendable heat sink. During atmospheric flight a fluorinated hydrocarbon is being considered however, since\nwater evaporates at too high a temperature for use in an environmental heat\nrejection system.\nThe Spraying Flash Evaporator is a recent concept for an expendable\nheat rejection sink. A. device of this type directs a sprayed liquid onto a\ndry heated surface where it is evaporated in single droplet fashion. The latent\nheat is provided by a circulating transport fluid which flows through the\nheat exchange surface. The Spraying Flash Evaporator potentially provides\n(1) a simple design offering high reliability, (2) control by supply rate pulse\nmodulation, (3) low acceleration sensitivity, (4) capability of multifluid\nevaporation, (5) long life expectancy, and (6) comparatively low weight.\nBecause of these features the evaporator is a candidate for space shuttle\nuse, and its development is being pursued by NASA.\nExploratory tests were conducted in 1970-71 to demonstrate the\nfeasibility of evaporation by direct spray impingement on the heated wall.\nThe objectives of the feasibility tests were (1) to demonstrate the required\nlevel of heat fluxes from the evaporating surface, (2) to determine the\nevaporant liquid utilization efficiency, and (3) to show control during load\ntransients by use of pulse mode evaporant modulation. The tests performed\nshowed: evaporation fluxes of approximately 8000 BTU/hr-ft2 for H20, NH3,\nand Freon 22 evaporants (with wall temperatures of 28\xc2\xb0F for H20); evaporant\nutilization of 70 percent for NH3, 80 percent Freon 22, and 93 percent for\nH20;\noutlet circulating fluid temperature control of 35 to 45\xc2\xb0F during\nload transients of zero to 25,000 BTU/hr full load in 4 minutes; and capability\nfor intermittent operation.\nBased on the feasibility demonstration tests, it was deemed desirable to pursue the design and testing of a prototype flash evaporator unit\nwhich would incorporate the size, construction, flow and temperature conditions\nexpected for the space shuttle application. The following report details the\nconsiderations given to the design of the evaporator, selection of a control\nsystem, fabrication, and testing of a laboratory prototype evaporator. The\nwork was performed for the NASA-MSC Crew Systems Division, with Mr. Frank\nCollier the Technical Monitor, by the Vought Missiles and Space Company.\n\n3.0 EVAPORATOR DESIGN\n\n3.1\n\nDesign Requirements\n\nThe Flash Evaporator performance 1s required to meet the following\nset of conditions.\nTransport Fluid: R-21 (CHC^F) \xc2\xae !850 LB/HR\nHeat Load: 0-50,000 BTU/HR\n\nOutlet Temperature: 40 + 5\xc2\xb0F\nEvaporants: H20 and R-22~ (CHWF2) in the appropriate pressure range\nFail Operational Redundancy\nAluminum Construction\nTo implement the design of an evaporator, there are additional considerations\nconcerning the pressure drop of the device, the evaporative side heat transfer\ncoefficient, and the volume of the unit. The testing during the previous\nprogram (NAS9-11254) reported in Reference 1 demonstrated heat fluxes of up\nto 8300 BTU/hr-ft^. However, analysis presented in that reference indicates\na definite limit in heat flux which theoretically is some 200% above the\nverified level. In addition, wall temperatures as low as 28\xc2\xb0F were realized\nin testing. The weight and pressure drop of the unit may be traded off\nusing an appropriate weight penalty factor for pressure drop to achieve a\nminimum total weight penalty. The volume penalty factor is more nebulous.\nThe volume will be naturally proportional to some (positive) power of the\nweight so that minimization of one insures minimization of the other to a\nreasonable approximation. The volume is optimum at a condition wherein the\npressure drop is somewhat higher than the true minimum for weight/pressure\ndrop considerations alone.\n3.2\n\nHeat Exchange Core Tradeoffs\n\nSeveral standard heat exchanger core sections have been considered\nfor the evaporator surface. The evaporator redundancy requirement has been\nmet using two single-fluid cores or a dual-fluid core. With two cores, a\ngreater number of evaporant supply points is required since each core would\nrequire a redundant evaporant supply. One basic difference is not accounted\nfor in the comparison. A dual fluid core is susceptible to damage or certain\nstructural failures which would fail both circuits in one event. This\nproblem is not pertinent for the two evaporator utilization except in the\nevent of some extreme damage or, for example, a colinear meteoroid penetration.\n3.2.1\n\nNon-Redundant Design\n\nFigure 1 shows the cores which have been considered for this study.\nMany of these core designs are intended for gas use and have non-optimum\nfin thickness. In such cases, increased fin thickness was not found to change\nthe results of the comparison. The cores were evaluated using the assumption\nof constant heat flux over the active surface and a constant heat transfer\n\n3 ..\n\nHardway\nSTRIP FIN\n\nI Easyway\nSTRAIGHT\nPLATE FIN\n\nWAVY PLATE\nFIN\n\no o o\no o o\no o o\ni\n\xe2\x80\x94\n\nPIN FIN\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\x94 fc\nMULTIPARALLEL\n\nml\nFIGURE. 1 CORE CONSTRUCTIONS CONSIDERED\n\n\xe2\x80\x94t\n\nconductance over the active surface, resulting in a constant value of\nTf-Tw. This value has been chosen as 10\xc2\xb0F for the comparison. The required\nvalue of UA then is 5000 BTU/hr-\xc2\xb0F. The transport fluid flow is distributed\nwithin a width of heat exchanger core for a length sufficient to achieve the\nrequired UA. As the width is increased, the area generally increases, the\nlength decreases, and the pressure drop decreases. This procedure allows one\nto compute a pressure drop versus area curve as shown in Figure 2 . The\narea coordinate effectively represents weight since the cores have similar\nweight per square foot characteristics. Clearly, the hardway short strip fin\nand multiparallel surfaces are superior, having an area of 3 to 3.5 ft2 at a\n3psi core pressure drop.\n3.2.2\n\nRedundant Design\n\nThree basic arrangements of dual fluids within a surface have been\nconsidered as shown below.\nactive\n1. Stacked\nredundant\n2. Side-By-Side\nredundant\n3. Intermingled\n\nvyyuy.\nredundant\n\nThe side-by-side and intermingled designs are separated at a condition where\nthe temperature drop from the active mid-point to the inactive mid-point\nachieves a value roughly equivalent to the temperature difference between\nthe fluid and active mid-point. An analysis of this simple case is presented\nbelow.\nThe side-by-side design must conduct heat from the active channel\nto each of its neighboring inactive surfaces, since the heat flux is\ndistributed uniformly over each exposed portion. The sketch below illustrates\nthe heat balance for a differential element in each of the inactive and\nactive portions.\nmidpoint, active f l u i d\n\nmidpoint, inactive f l u i d\nnon^\nCheated\nheated\n*\n\n->|l\n\n**\n\nb is depth into paper\n\n\' -\xe2\x84\xa2I\n\n4- dx\nevap\n\nevap\n\nMultiparallel\n\n9.0 -\n\n6.0 \xe2\x80\xa2\n\n5.0 -\n\noo\no.\n\n4.0 -\n\na.\nO\n\n3.0 -\n\n2.0 -\n\n1.0 -\n\n"\nT\n\n8\nAREA\nFIGURE\n\n2\n\n10\n\n2\n\nFT\n\nPRESSURE DROP AND AREA FOR VARIOUS NONREDUNDANT CORE DESIGNS\n\nIn the heated section, Q in = bhATdx, while in the non heated section,\nQ in = 0.

The\nunheated portion equation may be arranged in the form\nQ = KfhA (Tf - T&)\nwhere Kf\n\n=\n\n1\ni\n\n0\n\n7\n\n1 + 1/2 \\(a=-}\nI * i/ ^\n**^7\n\n+\n\'\n\nrvQ\n\n\xe2\x80\x94\nn\n\nsvO\n\ncoth \\ o\n^*W **\' I (\xe2\x80\x94} /\n\nIn this relation, Kf is a type of fin effectiveness and is the ratio of the\nheat transferred to that which would be transferred through a completely active\nsurface at temperature T^, Values near 0.5 represent strong fin conduction since\nthe heat transfer coefficient acts on only half the cooled surface. Figure\n3 shows the value of Kf versus the parameter ad.\nFor purposes of illustration the fin effectiveness Kf for a thickness (6) of 0.02 inches is shown in Figure 4 versus the active passage width\nI. From this curve, it is apparent that the span cannot be very large without\nincurring an excessive temperature drop in the uncooled portion. Thus a\nside by side redundant design will either have very narrow passages or will\ntend to be more than twice as large as a non redundant passage. Clearly also,\nas the passage width decreases, an important omission in the simplified\nanalysis becomes apparent. The web between the active and passive flow\npassages was assumed to have no contribution, but its effect will become\nsignificant as the passage width and the web height tend to be of the same\nsize. Obviously this leads to the third concept of intermingled design.\nThe short strip fin design (in hardway flow direction) and the\nmultiparallel arrangement with intermingled active and inactive systems are\ncompared for the redundant case. The short strip fin design with side-by-side\ndesign requires an active width so narrow (0.2 inch) that it is nearly\nequivalent to the multiparallel design and thus is not considered further.\nFigure 5 shows the pressure drop versus area for these surfaces. In the\ncase of the stacked design, the inner side (facing the cooling) has a reduced fin height and increased fin thickness to provide increased conductance\nfrom the outer side. The intermingled multiparallel is sensitive to the fin\nthickness as shown. For the height to width ratio of 5,\nthe 0.66\nfin-to-width ratio case is optimum and equal fin and width requires increased\narea. In reality, the equal fin and width provides a greater strength\nwhich is probably required to meet the 900 psi estimated no-fail internal\npressure.\nA comparison of non-redundant and redundant core design may be made\nbased on Figures 2 and 5. Using a 4 psi pressure drop results in the\nthe comparison of Table l . On the basis of this evaluation it is clear that\nthe strip fin design could be either redundant or non redundant without a\nsignificant weight difference, while the redundant multiparallel design favors\nthe redundant design. With the expected thick fin multiparallel design of\n6 ft2 area,the weight grows to 40 lb., or slightly above the strip fin design.\nBased on this estimate, the detailed design of the evaporator was sought for\nthe strip-fin redundant design. This decision was partly based on the fact\nthat the evaporative heat flux for the non-redundant design was estimated at\n14700 BTU/hr-ft2, which is 75% higher than the value demonstrated in feasibility\ntesting.\n3.3\n\nDetailed Design\n\nUp to this point only the area and pressure drop have been considered,\nwhile for the detailed design the configuration must enter the study.

A uniform\ndistribution provides the greatest margin against accumulation of frost.\nAt low heat load, during a given pulse, the wall temperature is depressed\nproportionally to the local value of q/UV The strong variation of q in the\nplate configuration of about 3 to 1 peak to average flux causes a significant\nreduction in margin against accumulation and to provide U proportional to\nq increases the pressure drop by nearly an order of magnitude. Therefore the\ncylindrical form of the evaporator was selected with a uniform conductance\nU over the active surface.\nLocal values of spray distribution for Freon were observed at 5 times\nthe average spray distribution. However, in the Freon case the evaporation\nsurface temperature is at or below -40\xc2\xb0F, a temperature the wall can approach\nwithout accumulation of evaporant. The value of q is 41,600 BTU/hr-ft^ and\nU is 830 BTU/hr-ft2-\xc2\xb0F, so Tf-Tw = 50\xc2\xb0F. Tf is 40\xc2\xb0F at the outlet so the\nminimum wall temperature is -10\xc2\xb0F, considerably above the lower limit.\nTherefore the core design is based on water considerations and not on Freon\noperational requirements.\nThe configuration has been developed to the following general\nspecification. A closed end cylinder with length 0.6 its diameter is expected\nto be sprayed with a nearly uniform spray flux of water. The area of the\ncylinder and end plate is required to be about 6 square feet having a superficial conductance U of 830 BTU/hr-ft^-T. The vapor vent size is scaled\nfrom the successful feasibility test to a 4-inch diameter. The nozzle position\nis such that the 50 degree semi vertex angle would strike the cylinder at the\nedge of the active surface. The active surface is required to be devoid of\nlocal areas of low conductance to prevent frost accumulation.\n3.3.1\n\nStrip Fin Core Design\n\nThe design of the strip fin heat exchange surface was pursued further\nto consider the details of its construction. Figures 6 through 9 show\nthe configuration which resulted. The core\'was configured of stacked sheets\nhaving a minimum conductance of 830 BTU/hr-ft2-\xc2\xb0F in non-constricted regions.\nHowever, in the joints there is no technique of construction which removes\n$he low conductance edge from the spray. Because these local areas drop by\n_ 7oFf for a maximum value of Tf-Tw = 17\xc2\xb0F, it was anticipated that the\n\xe2\x80\x94 I\nrisk of local frost formation in the corner areas was significant. In addition,\nthe pressure drop with the 6 ft2 active surface was estimated at 16 psi for\nthe final configuration in contrast with the value of 4 psi estimated in the\nearlier section.\n3.3.2\n\nMultiparallel Channel Design\n\nVarious manufacturing techniques were considered for achieving the\nmultiparallel flow arrangement as shown in Figure 10.

Of the techniques, the total tube wound\n(Configuration D) approach appears to offer (l) the least likelihood of\nsystem-to-system flow leaks, (2) the least dependence on a high Quality brazement, (3) the easiest transition from cylinder to end face, and (4) equivalent\nmanifolding difficulty. A design using the tube wound approach is shown in\nFigure 11, with a manifold area cutaway sketch shown in Figure 12. This design\nwas considered more promising than the octagonal arrangement primarily because\nof the lack of areas of low conductance with the multitube continuous wound\napproach.

This hold up volume may have a\ntendency to freeze onto the nozzle surface resulting in the formation of an\nice "tree" which apparently would grow to fill the evaporator void. Inasmuch\nas such an occurrence represents a failure, action to eliminate this potential\nfreezing was initiated.\nThe potential for freezing depends upon several factors; the liquid\nholdup volume, the exit orifice size, the nozzle material properties, the thermal\nconnection of the nozzle to an external heat source, the surface finish of the\nnozzle, the duty cycle of nozzle pulsing, and the entering evaporant temperature.\nIn general, the critical freezing tendency exists external to the nozzle, but\nit is conceivable that freezing could occur within the nozzle itself. The\nnozzle passages are characterized by a surface area and a conduction length for\nheat flow from an external source to a postulated liquid-vapor interface internal\nto ,the nozzle. As liquid is vaporized the conductance increases, so that the\nboiloff rate is further increased. If the boiloff rate is high enough to choke\nthe exit orifice at a pressure above the triple point, no freezing can occur.\nFor purposes of calculation the hold up volume is estimated as 0.03 cubic inches\n(0.5cc), with a conduction thickness of approximately 0.03 inch. This produces\na conduction area of 0.007 ft2 for a water film conductance of 0.9 BTU/hr-\xc2\xb0F. If\nthe nozzle temperature is held at 10\xc2\xb0F above the vaporization temperature, the\nheat flow rate is 9 BTU/hr representing a vapor flow rate of 2.5 x 10~6 Ib/sec.\nThe nozzle exit orifice (0.060 inch dia.) has an area of 2.83 x 10~3 in? which\nat the triple point pressure and 492\xc2\xb0R is choked at a flow of 6 x 10~6 Ib/sec.\nAt the worst condition, it is conceivable that the pressure internal to the\nnozzle could drop below the triple point so that freezing internal to the\nnozzle could be experienced. However, for nozzle temperatures greater than\n42\xc2\xb0F, conduction paths shorter than 0.03 inch and exit orifice less than\n0.060 inch diameter, the possibility is remote. In addition, freezing within\nthe nozzle would be self correcting. For* when flow is initiated, the ice\nwould be flooded with fresh, warm liquid at the supply pressure. At worst, the\nice would block the flow passage in such a way that an ice chunk is forced\nagainst a heated surface as shown below.\n\nLiquid at\nsupply pressure\n\nVapor\n\n23\n\nBecause of the force balance on the ice, it will continually contact the\nwall at a pressure of near the supply pressure. This insures sublimation\nat a rate large enough that all the available heat transfer is consumed\nin vapor generation. The ice moves in glacier style on the wall and its\njunction with the wall sustains a temperature depending on the heat transfer\nfrom the nozzle and the exit orifice area. At such a condition the rate of\ngrowth of the ice/liquid surface may be compared with the rate of recession\nto determine the stability of the situation. The heat transfer from the 42\xc2\xb0F\nsurrounding transport fluid to the nozzle at temperature T is\nQ = 3(42-Tn)\n\n(U = 3)\n\nThis produces a vapor flow of .0025 (42-T\xc2\xab) Ib/hr which will raise the choked\npressure upstream of the orifice to 0.28 (42-Tn) times the triple point\npressure. The situation reaches equilibrium at the condition where Tn and the\nchoked pressure lie on the vapor phase change saturated condition. Using\nthe values Pn and Tn from\nPn = (.088)(.28)(42-Tn)\n\n(psia)\n\nresults in an equilibrium achievement at T^ * 38\xc2\xb0F and Pn - 0.1 psia which\nis above the triple point. Therefore any ice blockage cannot persist.\nUpon release of the liquid holdup, the nozzle exhibits an initial\ntemperature dependence on the evaporant supply temperature, the transport\nfluid temperature and conductance to the nozzle, and the aftermath of previous\ncycles of cooling. In most instances this initial temperature will be an\naverage of the transport fluid temperature and the evaporant supply temperature.\nImmediately after flow cessation the liquid holdup begins to dribble out of\nthe nozzle, freezing and cooling the nozzle surface. The ice and nozzle may\nbe adherent only if "hooking" of ice and nozzle fingers occurs or if the\nnozzle temperature is suppressed below 32\xc2\xb0F.\nConsider a vapor layer which is thin with respect to the irregularities\nof the nozzle surface, such that a "hooking" effect could be obtained (see\nsketch below).\n\nNOZZLE\n\n24\n\nTo investigate this proposition, consider the magnitude of heat transfer\nthrough the layer of vapor, into the ice, and the sublimation at the surface.\nIn steady state, the heat flux through the vapor layer is\nit )vapor = Kv\n\nj\n\nA\n\nOy\n\n= KT \xe2\x80\x94j\ni\n\nOJ\n\n= T[ ) ice\nH\n\nwhere TM is the nozzle temperature, Tj is the nozzle side ice temperature,\nTS is trie vacuum surface ice temperature, 6y is the vapor thickness, 6j is the\nice thickness, Kv and KI are vapor and ice conductivities. The maximum value\nof Q/A of ice is given by 1/4 Xi3 pv, where ^13 is the sublimation enthalpy,\np is ambient vapor density, and v is the average molecular velocity, V8/ir RT.\nThe evaporation rate, and this heat transfer rate, is shown in Figure 13 for\nvarious surface temperatures.

Thus only a thickness of 1/8 inch of ice could\n"hook" itself to a rough nozzle surface.

These small thicknesses, it has also been\nshown, must sublime at a rate of about 10 Ib/ft^/hr if the roughness is less\nthan 10~5 ft (100 y inches). The persistence of such a layer is readily\nestimated by calculating the time to total evaporation of a 0.01 ft. thickness\nat 10 lb/fwhr. A layer 0.01 ft thick represents 0.6 lb/ft2 and would persist\n0.06 hour. Clearly some combination of smoother surface or high nozzle temperature must be provided to avoid this lengthy persistence. The persistence\nof any ice formation must be less than the cycle time of the evaporator\nfunction (order .002 hour). The evaporation flux is proportional to e/6^\nwhile the maximum ice thickness is proportional to 6R/e, where <$R is the\nroughness and e is the nozzle temperature above freezing. The persistence\ntime is proportional to (e/6$)*- so that an increase in E/<$R of a factor of\nsix will allow extinction of any accumulation within 0.002 hour. A surface\nfinish of 16y inches or nozzle temperature in excess of 38\xc2\xb0F will\naccomplish the desired result.\nAn additional mode of attachment of ice to a solid surface with temperature above 32\xc2\xb0F can be postulated. If the metal surface has filaments\nor whiskers of significant length to diameter ratio, the ice could attach\nto the end of the filament. This contact could be maintained at a temperature\nbelow 32\xc2\xb0F even though the base of the filament is above 32\xc2\xb0F. In such a\ncase, the ice could be firmly attached to the solid surface. The whiskered\nsurface is not considered a probable occurrence.\nIf the surface of the nozzle is lowered to below 32\xc2\xb0F, ice adhesion\nis possible without a vapor interface. Overall conductances are generally\nthe same as those with a vapor interface, and the thicknesses of ice possible\nto be maintained would be similar. There are three items crucial to the\ndetermination of whether the nozzle surface could be lowered to below 32\xc2\xb0F.\nThese are the quantity of liquid holdup, the mode of fluid outflow, and the\navailability of heat from the nozzle and its intimate surroundings to the\ncooled locations.\nAs a droplet is formed on the nozzle surface the rapid heat transfer\nwill exhaust the heat capacity of the nozzle to evaporate the drop. Within\nthe short lifetime of the liquid, the affected portion of the nozzle may be\nquite small. The question arises "Does the nozzle temperature drop below\n32\xc2\xb0F during the droplet lifetime?" To answer this, postulate that the nozzle\nis semi-infinite at temperature T-j, and that it is suddenly lowered in\ntemperature at the surface to 32\xc2\xb0F. The classic solution for the temperature\ndistribution is:\nT (x,t) = Tj + (32-Ti) erf /\n*\n\\\n\\ 2 v/6t~ /\n\nwhere a is the diffusivity. The heat flux at the surface (x=0) is\n= - K \xc2\xa7 or\n1\nK\nQ/A--C32-H)\n\n27\n\nThe energy flowing through the surface through time T is\n\nThe droplet evaporative energy is X23 p<S per unit area, where 6 is the\ninitial thickness. Equating these yields\n(T1 - 32) K\n\nP5\n\n=\n\nThis equation may be solved for T as\nP6\n2 K (Ti-32)\n\nThe heat flux at this time is\n(T - 32 )2 K2\nTT a\n\np6\n\nBy calculating the heat flux at the last instant of evaporation of the\ndroplet, one may compare its value with that required to evaporate the droplet at a temperature of 32\xc2\xb0F. If the calculated value exceeds the required\nvalue, subfreezing nozzle temperatures are not expected, and vice versa.\nFor argument, set Tj to 42, p = 62.5, \\23 = 1070, and 6 = .002 ft.,\nQ/A = 47.5 Kpfic = 47.5\n\nK2\n\xc2\xa3-\n\nFor aluminum, Q/A calculates to 1.67 x 10^; for brass, 1.39 x 10 , and\nfor stainless steel, 0.43 x 105 BTU/hr-ft^. Heat fluxes of 105 are approximately required for evaporation, so that the stainless steel surface could\nwell dip below 32\xc2\xb0 F. These calculations indicate What would occur with a\nsingle sheet of liquid 0.002 ft thick. The total amount of liquid held up\nis of some interest since thicker sheets are more restrictive and multiple\nrepeated sheet applications would occur if sufficient liquid were available.\nThe simplest statement of the effect of holdup volume is by a timeindependent heat balance equating the evaporation energy of the holdup volume\nand the stored energy change of the nozzle material. The volume of liquid\nis designated V^, of nozzle V\xc2\xab; thermal properties are density p, specific\nheat cp; and vaporization entnalphy X. The heat balance may be written\nP\n\nN CPNVN AT\n\nN=\n\nP\n\nA V* X\n\n28\n\nThe value of X is about 1000 BTU/lb, p = 62.4\nsolid materials is about 35 to 50 BTU/ft 3 -\xc2\xb0R.\nfor aluminum) yields\n\nIb/ft , and p^cp^ for most\nUsing 35 as typical (actual\n\nV.\nAT N =1780 T^\nV\nN\n\nIf the nozzle is to be prohibited from attaining sub-freezing temperatures,\nand V initially has temperature 42\xc2\xb0F, the volume ratio must be less than\nV\n\xc2\xa3/ N < -\xc2\xb0056- The value of V& has been estimated at 0.028 cu inches so\nthat VM must be greater than 5 cu inches. Clearly this volume is larger\nthan the anticipated nozzle volume, so a portion of nozzle surroundings\nmust be involved.\nOne shortcoming of the foregoing analysis is that it was assumed\nall of the fluid was vaporized. Certainly some small solid formation could\nbe tolerated without incurring a problem, but the amount is difficult to\njudge. The other shortcoming lies in the time dependent nature of the assumptions\nand the premise that only stored energy was available to the nozzle. The\ntime required to exude the fluid from the nozzle may also be longer than\nthe time between evaporator pulses.\nThe cooling effect from a sudden cooling propagates to a distance\nx in time t given by\nx \xc2\xab 2V5F\nThis distance represents the location of first impulse while the distances\nabout half as great incur significant heat fluxes. Stated another way,\nelements located at a distanceVctt~fn)m the cooling can contribute significantly to the heat flux at the cooling location. If the time in the relation\nis half the time between turn off and turn on of the evaporant, or about 5\nseconds, the effective location of cooling may be estimated. For aluminum\nct e .001 sq ft per second and x=vS^~ = -07 ft. A tube of coolant located\naround the nozzle area at a radius of 0.4 inches can be fairly effective in\nheating the nozzle face. In such a case, the minimum heat flux supplied to\nthe nozzle would be the steady state value, while initial transient values\nwould be higher.\nConsider the simplified steady state model shown below\nConvection\nBoundary\nA\'t r2 = 0.4 inch\nEvaporation radius\nAt r = 0.1 inch\n\n29\n\nK2ur {\xc2\xa3\'\n\n= Q\nn\nT<- - T, = JL\n2\nI\ntiii\\\n\nQ = \xe2\x80\x94Vv\n\nr\n\n?\nlog r-i\n-1\n\n(T, -\n\nThe convective heat transfer coefficient is h and yields\nQ = 2 TT r2 h (T f -T 2 )\nThe overall conductance of the convective and conductive components is\nK so that Q = K (Tf-T-j)\nK =\n\n1\nh\n\n2irK\n\nFor h = 200 BTU/hr-ft2-\xc2\xb0F, and K = 100 BTU/hr-ft-\xc2\xb0F, r2 = 0.4 inch, and\nr-j = 0.1 inch, K = 38.5 BTU/hr-\xc2\xb0F. Almost all the resistance is associated\nwith the convection heat transfer. Within the 10 seconds between pulses\nthe amount of heat which could be transferred from a 42\xc2\xb0F fluid to a 32\xc2\xb0F\ncentrally cooled area is slightly over 1 BTU, or\nQ = (38.5 BTU/hr-\xc2\xb0-F) (10\xc2\xb0F) (10 sec)\n\n= 1.03 BTU\nThe amount of fluid evaporated by 1 BTU is .001 Ib which represents a hold\nup volume of 0.0267 cu inches. Thus, conservatively, the nozzle surface may\nbe raised to above 32\xc2\xb0F at the end of a 10 second complete evaporation of\nthe expected 0.028 cu inches of holdup fluid. The surface temperature may\ndrop to near or below 32\xc2\xb0F in the 10 second period, but will be quickly restored to normal levels.\nIn summary, the valve/nozzle was designed to prevent the possible\nfreezing of the water evaporant by: (1) minimizing the valve-to-nozzle volume for\nminimum liquid holdup. A holdup volume of 0.028 cubic inches (0.46 cc) should\nbe small enough when accompanied by the other recommended items. (2) Providing\nliquid transport flow to the vicinity of the nozzle at temperatures 10\xc2\xb0 above\nfreezing. Heat transfer coefficients of about 200 BTU/hr-ft2-\xc2\xb0R at distances\naccessible to the nozzle are adequate. A consideration of the distance\nwhich is acceptable leads to the selection of a material with high thermal\ndiffusivity. Aluminum is nearly twice as "close" as brass, and far surpasses\nstainless steel, while avoiding material electrochemical difficulties with\nthe aluminum evaporator; it is thus preferred. (3). machining the nozzle face\nto a 16 jj inches roughness to preclude the possibility of ice formation on a\nwarm nozzle exposed to the evaporant by an interlocking process.\n\n30\n\n3. 5\n\nStructural Considerations\n\nThe evaporator tubes have been analyzed to determine the stresses produced\nin various configurations. First, a single tube with internal pressure 600 psi\nproduces stresses of 24,500 psi and 31,400 psi at the tube corner and midpoint\nof long side, respectively. A tube within a group which is perfectly brazed\nand with pressure of 600 psi applied to alternate tubes results in stresses of\n14,900 psi and 10,550 psi at the tube corner and long side midpoint respectively.\nWith both systems at 600 psi pressure the stresses are 4200 psi at the corner\nand less at other locations. Within the braze the tension stress reaches\n3000 psi, shear stress reaches 2480 psi for the both systems pressurized case.\nIn the manifold regions, at 600 psi pressurization in both systems,\nthe direct tension in the manifold joint reaches 3750 psi, while the tension\ninduced by bending of the tube group reaches 14,850 psi. With one system under\npressure the latter stress rises to 26,750 psi.\nThe effect of pressure internal to the evaporator chamber tends to\n"balloon" the evaporator resulting in high stresses near the shoulder or at the\nexit manifold depending on the constraint of the assembly. The stresses are less\nwhen the vapor exit duct is not rigidly fixed, i.e., is mounted by a slider or\nbellows arrangement. Internal pressurization of 1 psi produces limit stresses\nof about 30,000 psi according to an approximate analysis. This stress adds to\nstresses already present from tube pressurization.\nThe above values are based on analysis which is preliminary in nature,\nbut which should be representative. Actual tubes in the annealed condition\n(yield point * 9000 psi) were pressurized individually, and of the five yielded,\nthe lowest yield pressure was 700 psi. The evaporator assembly (non heat\ntreated) was pressurized to 300 psi without incident prior to testing.\n\n31\n\n3.6\n\nControl Analysis\n\nTwo types of control logic have been considered for spray pulse\ntailoring. The first is a common system where a temperature representative\nof the fluid outlet is used to initiate spraying above a certain temperature\nand to cease spraying below a lower temperature. In the second, a logic,\nwhich predicts the duty cycle based on inlet temperature and corrects the duty\ncycle based on outlet temperature, may be employed. Of these, the former is\nsimpler and was selected to avoid development of the latter system.\n3.6.1\n\nTemperature Switched Control\n\nWith pulse mode control, it is desired to relate the fluid outlet\ntemperature excursion to the wall temperature excursion. This may be performed by approximate analytical means or by numerical modeling. The former\nis capable of faster estimation of quasi-static load cases and is useful\nfor parametric study, while the latter accounts for more of the details,\nsuch as non-uniformity and allows computation of transient effects. Both\nmodels have been developed; the numerical model results are presented first\nwith the approximate analytical model discussed later. The basic function of\nthe control is best described in terms of the temperature distribution in\nthe evaporator. Figure "14 shows the instantaneous temperature distribution\nwithin an idealized evaporator. The fluid and wall temperature execute\ntransient variations relative to the temperatures shown as sketched in the\ninset of Figure 14. At each point (except for longitudinal conduction which\nhas a small effect), the temperatures undergo the same relative variations.\nTwo overall observations are pertinent concerning Figure 14. First, 3Tf/3A =\n-QL/WGfA so that the temperature slopes (fluid and wall) through the evaporator\nare proportional to the load. Also, the mean (time averaged) temperature\ndifference between fluid and wall is AT = LQ/UA, and is thus also proportional\nto the load. A wall -mounted temperature sensor in the cooled region, AA\nupstream of the last cooled location, has a temperature related to the outlet\ntemperature expressed by:\nT\n\ns = Tout - i\n\n_T\n\'s ~ \'out\n\nT\n\nA\n\nAA\n\n- *T\n\n{ AA\n\\*c"f\n\n1\\\n" Uj\n\nThe mean sensor-to-outlet temperature difference is ^ independent of heat load,\nLQ, and is only slightly dependent upon flow rate, w, since U is nearly\nproportional to flow rate. The sensor can then be used to control the outlet\ntemperature from a position on the wall upstream of the outlet. Also, of\ncourse, the sensor could be located in the outlet line. There are two advantages\nto the upstream position of the sensor. First, the cooled wall executes a\nlarger temperature excursion than the fluid, where the wall temperature simply\nlags the fluid temperature at the outlet position. This leads to a tighter\n\n32\n\nT\n\nIN\n\nLU\nDC\n\nD\nDC\nLU\n0.\n5\nLU\n\nT\n\nOUT\nUPSTREAM\nSENSOR\nPOSITION\n\n,\'T\nDOWNSTREAM\nSENSOR\nPOSITION\n\n-oAREA\nCOOLED REGION\n\nFIGURE 14 TEMPERATURE DISTRIBUTION WITHIN EVAPORATOR\n\n33\n\ncontrol over fluid temperature. Second, the sensor in the upstream position\nparticipates with both primary and redundant fluid systems without switching\nsensors. It may be possible to use a sensor positioned on the wall in the\ndownstream position also, depending on the relative position of the edge of\nthe sprayed zone and the manifolding.\nThe flash evaporator design has been subjected to a thermal analysis\nto analyze its prospective response and to aid in sensor positioning. A\nnodal model has been constructed as shown in Figure 15. In region 1 of the\nmodel, the model is characterized as a single tube encapsulating a fluid node.\nNine of these nodes, comprising 90 percent of the active area are arranged\nin physical sequence. Following these nodes, there are eight segments representing the remaining 10 percent active area. Each of the segments represents the fluid as a single node and the tube by a composite of six\nsections as shown in the inset. The sensor is a single node which may be\nthermally connected to any of the nodes in the model in such a way as to\nsimulate the response of the sensor. A major simplification has been made\nin constructing the model, in that despite the eccentricity of the spray ports,\nrotational symmetry is assumed which implies also that the flow in each tube\nis assumed equal.\n\n.Sensor\nAdditional Breakdov\nNear Sensor\n6 solid nodes\nper fluid node\n(see inset)\nRegion 1\nOne solid node\nper fluid node\n\nFIGURE 15 EVAPORATOR NODAL MODEL\n\nThe evaporant spray distribution was extracted from the feasibility\ntest results. The increase in heat load^hence flow rate>in the present design\nresults in a small change in the spray angles according to manufacturer\'s data.\nAccounting for this effect, the spray distribution has been estimated as\n\n34\n\nshown in Figure 16 for water and Freon\n\n1.4\n\nLocal Spray\nAverage Spray\n\nH20 SPRAY\n\n1.2\n\n|\n\n1.0\n0.8\n0.6\n\n\xe2\x80\x94\n0.4\n0.2\n\n0\n0\n\n20\n\nIN LET\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n1\n\nPERCENT ACTIVE AREA\n\nOUTLET\n\nLocal Spray\nAverage Spray\n\nFREON\n\n0\n\nt\n\nINLET\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80 .\n\nPERCENT ACTIVE AREA\n\nFIGURE 16 DISTRIBUTION OF EVAPORANT SPRAY\n35\n\n100\n\ni\n\nOUTLET\n\nThe resulting surface and fluid temperature distribution in the\nvicinity of the vapor and fluid outlet at steady state full load conditions\nis shown in Figure 17.\nThe Freon spray distribution is much more dense in the vicinity\nof the exit so that the corresponding temperature gradient in Figure 17\nis much higher. This causes the surface temperatures to cross each other\nat a reasonably well defined location. The wall temperature with Freon\nspray is depressed significantly below the fluid while with water it is\nnot. This causes the control cycle to be different as explained in a\nlater paragraph. The steady state map can be used to locate the sensor for\nnearly full load operation. At the steady condition, locating the sensor\nat positions near the fluid outlet results in the achievement of the "off"\ntemperature, even though the fluid outlet is at or above the desired level.\nThus, with a 39\xc2\xb0F (3.8 C)sensor "off" temperature, the sensor must be located\nat a radius greater than a determinable amount. A similar situation exists\nfor the nearly full load operation and the "off" sensor temperature. That is\nif all temperatures are reduced by 10\xc2\xb0F in Figure I? the sensor must turn the\nspray off to avoid an under-temperature condition. Simple relations may be\nwritten for these two limits. Define T(r) as the temperature of a sensor\nmounted at position r. This sensor controls the spray such that T > T "on"\ninitiates spraying which continues until T < T "off". Assume T"on" = 42.5\xc2\xb0F\n(5.8\xc2\xb0C)and T"off" = 39\xc2\xb0F (3.8\xc2\xb0C). Tmax and Tmjn define the control band upper\nand lower limits, respectively of 45 and 35\xc2\xb0F. T0ut ~ T(r) must not exceed\nT\nmax - T"off" or tne device would turn off without achieving the required outlet temperature band.\nT\n\nout -T\xc2\xab < T\xc2\xbbx -T\xc2\xbboff\xc2\xbb \xe2\x80\xa2 "5 -39 \xe2\x80\xa2 6T\nReference to Figure 17 shows that this is satisfied for both evaporants if\nr > 5.0 inches. Similarly, another inequality may be derived from the condition that the device must turn off before the outlet drops below the\nminimum allowed temperature.\nT r\n\n< > -Tout <Toff -Tmin \'39\'35 \' 4\xc2\xb0F\n\nThis condition is satisfied at positions r < 5.75 inches. These conditions\nthen require 5.0 < rj CII o \\J i < 5.75 If , one sensor is to control both evaporants.\nThis condition is necessary, but not sufficient. It is anticipated that the\ninequalities must be satisfied with some margin if the transient behavior\nis to be satisfactory. Also shown on Figure 17 are the upstream and downstream positions for the sensor with water operation. The downstream Freon\nposition conflicts with the manifold and is not included.\nResults of computer analysis to determine sensor lag effects were\nobtained for both the upstream and downstream positions of the sensor. The\ncontrol points were 42.5 F (5.8c) switch-on temperature and 39F (3.9c) switchoff temperature. Figure 18 shows the effect of probe response on tKe outlet\ntemperature at low (5 percent of full) load operation with both the upstream\nand downstream sensor position.

Similar results are obtained at near maximum load\nfor the device, while moderate loads are more tolerant of probe lag. From\nthis result, it was deemed desirable to employ a sensor with less than one\nsecond characteristic response time. It is also obvious that the downstream sensor position allows a greater temperature excursion.\nThe effect of heat load on the outlet temperature is predicted in\nFigure 19 with nominal transport fluid flow rate. At low heat loads, a quick\ncooling pulse, which causes spray cutoff, is followed by a longer warmup\ntime to spray initiation. The rise and fall rates are similar at midload\nrange which produces the shortest cycling time and least temperature excursion.\nNear maximum load, the cooling pulse lengthens while the heating phase decreases in length. There is a load-sensitive shift in the average outlet\ntemperature with the downstream sensor location which is negligible with the\nupstream position. The shift is in the direction of the highest temperature\nchange rate and is due to the lag of the wall temperature behind the fluid\ntemperature. In addition to the mean temperature shift, the maximum-to-minimum\ntemperature excursion varies with the load and is greater for the downstream\nsensor position. For this reason, the upstream position is favored.\nThe following section describes an approximate analytical solution\nfor the transient temperature of the evaporator wall and transport fluid.\nThe analysis depends on assumptions that both the local wall and fluid may\nbe characterized by mean temperatures, that the heat transfer between wall\nand fluid is characterized by a time-invariant conductance, that the thermal\nmass of fluid and wall are invariant, and that the heat absorbed from the\nwall occurs in square wave pulses of constant magnitude over the entire\ncooled region.

In general, plots of\nWl(0)-W-|(0-|) may be obtained versus 62 with parameter, L. This plot is\ndependent on the ratio, Tf/rw, also, which, for the evaporator, has a value\nof 0.73. From such a plot, the anticipated dead band of the controller may\nbe used to determine the value of 9? corresponding to each value of L.\nFor the present case, with W] (O)-Wi (9-|) = 0.48, the solutions for the fluid\ntemperature (F) have been generated.

This corrector is designed to compensate for (1)\nvariations in transport fluid flow rate, (2) variations in evaporant flow\nrate and enthalpy, (3) non-linearity in the predictor phase electronics,\nand (4) some correction for the error induced by the lag during transients.\nThis corrector function modifies equation ( 6 as follows:\n~)\nsignal " set\nmax " set\n\n+\n\n*, + \\\n\nwhere A results from\ndA _ KV\nn(T\n\ndt\n\nout\n\n_ T\n\n\'ser\n\n^\n\nA\n\n* \xe2\x80\xa2H < \xe2\x80\xa2 &\n&\n\nVin -\n\n- "max\n\nThe corrector phase must be examined for its tendency to be unstable, a\ncondition induced by lag of the outlet temperature measurement and the\nmagnitude of the value R.

It should be\nobvious that convergence is necessary but not sufficient for a system\nhaving a continued finite perturbation. An additional criteria is that the\namplitudes of successive cycles must be raonatonically diminishing with\nincreasing 9. Particularly this should be strengthened since the representation shown here does not include the cyclic temperature perturbations resulting from the predictor-required pulsing. This latter cyclic perturbation\ncan conceivably tend to excite the corrector activity in a type of resonant\nmanner.

A VMSC\nsponsored program was initiated to determine whether a group of tubes could\nbe wound side-by-side representing the first unit described herein. The\ngeneral fabrication technique followed the sequence of steps outlined with\nrefinements added in three attempts. First a male mandrel was built of wood\nto the desired contour. The center of the face was recessed as shown in\nthe sketch below.\nJ25\n^ End\n\xe2\x80\x94\'\n\nr=;1.8\nA\xc2\xb05\'\nr=10\n\nThe 0.120"x 0.36"O.D. rectangular tubes were precleaned to remove grease and\noxide. The starting end of each tube was welded closed. A starter plate\nwas formed, to which the end of each tube was welded at an angle such that\nthe tubes were initially positioned for windup. The tubes were then formed\nsimultaneously to lie adjacent to each other and contact the mandrel. As\nthe shoulder position was reached, each tube acquired an increasing twist\nso that the short side of the tube always contacted the mandrel surface.\nTack welds were used progressively to hold the tubes together during the windup.process. Photographs of the work in progress are shown in Figures 22 and\n2^~. The ends of the tube were allowed to extend past the assembly as vent\ntubes for air during brazing which was performed in a salt bath. The finished\ntube wound assembly is shown in Figure 24 . To this assembly a skirt piece\nwas tacked in preparation for the skirt manifold junction. The skirt sheet\noverlapped about four tubes and extended a little over an inch.\nPreparation for brazing involved cleaning of the assembly and attachment of brazing filler. For dip brazing the use of filler in wire form was\nselected over sheet and flux/powdered filler slurry. This selection was mad\'e\nprimarily upon experience of personnel associated with the braze operation.\nThe use of mechanically attached filler often leads to loss of material to\nthe convection currents in the flux bath. The weld tack sites used during\nassembly were used to attach eutectic braze alloy wire by Welding. Filler\nwire .032 inch diameter was tacked on 3 to 5 inch spans at approximately\n.375 inch spacing over the cylindrical and shoulder portions of the assembly\nas shown in Figure 25. A group of wires was formed into rings and spokes,\nand was laid into the bottom of the basket. The unit was again cleaned and\n\n49\n\n\xc2\xab1\n\n>_1\nCQ\n\nUJ\n00\n\noo\n\n\xc2\xab=c\nCt\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2z.\no\nLU\n\nca\n\nu.\n\xe2\x80\xa2ef\n\nca\nUJ\n\na:\nO\n\nt-H\n\nu_\n\nQ\n\nuJ\n1-4\n\nca\n33\n\nai\n\no\nO\n\n\xc2\xabc\ns\xc2\xbb\nUJ\n\nto\nUJ\n\na flux/filler powder slurry added to the tacked regions. The unit was\npreheated to 1000\xc2\xb0F for 20 minutes and then dipped into the brazing salt\nbath at 1100\xc2\xb0F for approximately one minute. After removal from the bath\nit was allowed to cool in air for several minutes and was then introduced\nto a vat of boiling water. Post cleaning to remove the smut and about four\nhours exposure to boiling water removed the residual flux.\nThe integral manifolds were formed on the face end by machining\nfrom stock. On the skirt end, tubing was rolled to slightly oversized\ndiameter, welded to form a hoop, and cut on a band saw to remove the inside\nof the hoop. The manifolds were then cut and fit to the basket. Tube ends\nand side walls were alternately opened to allow flow into the appropriate\nmanifold. A flow check was run on each tube to preclude flow blockage. The\nends of all tubes at the skirt were cut off and alternate tubes were blocked\nat the end and opened under the secondary manifold position. Manifolds were\nattached by welding. (See Figure 12) "\nThe aft cone and nozzle plate were^formed in a comparatively\nstraightforward manner. Tubing was rolled to a spiral helix and tack welded\nto a preformed cone. The helix was formed by controlling manually the radius\nof bend as the winding progressed and manually pulling the wound portion away\nfrom the rolling plane. The soft aluminum used could readily be hand forced\nto a reasonable displacement during assembly. This back cone was also dip\nbrazed. The nozzle plate was formed of two plates diffusion bonded together.\nOne of the plates was milled to form a passage through which a warm fluid\ncould be diverted in the assembled article.\n4.1\n\nFabrication of First Unit\n\nThe initial fabrication was unsuccessful due to penetration of salt\nthrough the tube wall and longitudinal failure of two tubes. The penetration\nof salt occurred when an area of the normal tube had been welded using\na lower melting point alloy. The eutectic alloy positioning onto the tack\nwelds was preferred so that the crater of eutectic-filled material would not\npenetrate the entire wall. In some instances, however, the wire was melted\nshort of the weld area and was carelessly welded to the tube. The crater\nthus formed melted in the braze pot allowing flux penetration. Also the rod\nused to perform tack welding was of an alloy having a solidus temperature\nbelow 1100\xc2\xb0F so that the original tack welds could also have been penetrated.\nThis fact was only realized after brazing of the second unit since the tacks\nwere first ground off and then replaced on the first unit. The longitudinal\nsplitting of the tube observed in two tubes results from the extrusion of the\ntube wherein the material must part and reform in the extrusion die. Contamination and slight temperature variations during the extrusion lead to\na fault in the direction of the extrusion which can subsequently fail. Tests\nto eliminate bad tubes were applied on the following articles. These tests\nincluded die penetrant (ZYGLO) and pressurization to 0.66 yield point, neither\nof which disclosed faults. Also used was a simple wedge test where a tapered\ndrill rod was driven into the tube end producing a failure in weakly joined\ntubes (see Figure 26). The first unit was scrapped due to the tube splitting.\n\n54\n\n4.2\n\nFabrication of Second Unit\n\nThe second unit was fabricated like the first with several differences.\nBased on the first unit, some tooling was fabricated in the form of individual\ntensioners on each tube, a rotating foundation for the mandrel , and a tool\nwhich fit the external shape of the evaporator on the shoulder. In addition\nit was observed that the "righting" tendency of the tube undergoing transition\nfrom front face to cylinder could be compensated by pretwisting the tubes\nbefore assembly. The amount of "righting" tendency was measured as follows:\nA plate of radius 10 inches was placed on a table with the tube fixed thereto\nat an initial angle. The tube was then formed to the plate radius and the\nrelative angle of plate and tube measured at several locations (see sketch)\nFinal Tube\nPositio\nC-C\ninitial\nposition\nB-B\nA-A\n\nThe derivative of the twist is approximately\nAXgr\n, where AXpQ denotes\nthe arc length between B and C. The data obtained was prepared tnusly to\nproduce the curve of Figure 27 . As the tube makes the transition from flat\nto cylindrical surface, a total angle of 85.5 degrees transition occurs\nlinearly distributed over the length in which the tube makes the transition.\nFor a shoulder radius of 1.85 inches used in the first and second units, the\nlength is approximately 35 inches. The twist angle measured from the initiation\nof the shoulder region is found from the equation\nX\n\n<f>\n\n=\no\n\nUsing the data from Figure 27 for dx this equation integrates readily to the\nrequired twist function. In reality it proved difficult to precisely twist\nthe tube closer than five degrees with the tooling available. The\nspacing between adjacent tubes was only three degrees and a five degree error\nat an early section produced a magnified error a.t a later section. For this\nreason some tubes had been twisted in excess and others deficiently so that\nthe uniform wedge between tubes did not appear. These discrepancies were\ncorrected by gently twisting a local area of individual tubes. However, this\ntwisting resulted in an inevitable gap between tubes proportional to the\ncorrection applied. This second unit was eventually completed and brazed.\n\n56\n\n\xc2\xa3\n<y\n\nCO\n\nr\xe2\x80\x94\n\nCM\n\nPO\n\nO>\n\nJ3\n\no\n\no\n\n00\n\nO\n\no\no\n\no\n\no\n2;\n\nl\xc2\xa3)\n\nUJ\n\no o\n\no\n\nO\n\nin\n\n"C\n\nCO\n\n<M\nUJ\n\no;\n\nI\nD\nO\n\nO\n\no\n\nO\nO\n\nco\n\no\n\nCM\n\no<\n\nax o\n0\n\noo\n\nco\n\nvo\nUl\n\n6ap\n\n57\n\nco\nXp\n\no\n\nI\n\n-O\n\naO\n\nThe weld rod used for tacking was 5% silicon having solidus below 1100\xc2\xb0F.\nThis was recognized before brazing and high melting point pure aluminum\nrod tacks were added on the cylindrical section. During brazing, some of\nthe tacks on the bottom face were broken and the tubes offset. To remedy\nthis the unit was rebrazed with a weight on top of the flat section. The\nunit was realigned during the operation but the tube ends which had been\nsealed with 5% silicon rod softened to penetration of salt. Attempts to\nremove the salt proved futile so a third unit was fabricated.\n4.3\n\nFabrication of the Third Unit\n\nHaving the experience gained in the first two attempts, it was\ndecided to modify the shoulder radius to 0.85 inches. At this radius the\ntube-to-tube angle is about eight degrees and the twist error estimate reduced to four degrees. The twist also would be accomplished in a length of\n17 inches. This benefit was only obtained with the sacrifice that the braze\nwould fill only a portion of the gap. The only other modification was that\npure aluminum rod would be exclusively used for tacking the assembly.\nDuring fabrication some modification of the tube position was required\nafter winding the shoulder, but a significant improvement was noted. A\nconsiderable number of shrink cracks resulted due to the change from 5%\nsilicon weld rod to pure aluminum. Also the starting ring was found to leak\nprofusely. The tube ends were severed from the starting ring and each welded\nclosed individually before the leakage problem was solved. Even after the\nunit had been leak checked, small cracks continued to.occur.\nBrazing of the unit was routine with the best quality of the three\nattempts achieved. The gaps of .1 inch on the shoulder were nearly brazed\ncompletely. In three locations, shrink cracks formed which admitted small\namounts of salt and aluminum. These deposits were readily removed although\nthe side wall was opened to relieve the aluminum. The skirt end manifolds\nwere welded on without incident, but the flat end manifolds caused differential\nshrinkage when welded. This shrinkage caused the braze to fail in several\nlocations between the tubes. In those areas filler was added to insure heat\nconductance between tubes and to eliminate vapor leakage. The filler was also\napplied to the large gaps on the shoulder portion. Filler material was mixed\nfrom 240 mesh aluminum powder 95 percent and 5 percent "flake" aluminum which\nis very fine like that used for paint pigment. This mixture was suspended\nin the minimum amount (about 1%) of sodium silicate (water glass) solution\nand trowelled into the desired locations. A crude thermal diffusivity test\nshowed that the conductivity of the material was about 20 BTU/hr-ft-\xc2\xb0F.\nMost of the filler failed to bond to the shoulder area completely but\napparently filled the small cracks well.\n\n58\n\n5.0 EVAPORATOR TESTING\n\nThe prototype unit was prepared for testing. The object of the\nprogram was manifold with the overall objective to demonstrate the capability\nof the evaporator to meet the projected space shuttle requirements. Items\nin this requirement were (1) to shpw the absence pf,nozzle freezing problems,\n(2) to demonstrate complete evaporation for all test conditions, (3) for\ndemonstrate all redundancy modes, (4) to test controller action, (5) to\ncheck for exhaust tube frost tendencies, and (6) to evaluate sensitivity to\noff-nominal conditions.\nThe test item was installed in the space environment testing chamber\nas shown in the schematic diagram of Figure 28. Transport flow was measured\nin the 40\xc2\xb0F section of the loop between the auxiliary cooler and the heaters.\nThe heaters were lOkw helical-passage electrical units arranged in parallel\nfor pressure .drop minimization. Valves in each leg were adjusted to provide\nequal flow with the flow through each leg monitored to indicate instability.\nThe pressure in the loop was maintained by a pump-suction-side accumulator pressurized by heating to insure the existence of subcooled Freon 21 in the entire\nloop. Two pumps were flowed in series to achieve the pressure drop of about\n75 psi through the cooler, filters and heater.\n\nThe evaporator was instrumented to reflect all flow rates and thermodynamic conditions pertinent to the evaporator function. Figure 29 is the\ndata output format as produced by the on-line data system, while Table 2:\ngives a description of the instruments used for each channel. The thermocouples were arranged as shown in Figure 30 on the external surface of the\nevaporator. The full data scan shown in Figure 29 was collected at one\nminute intervals. An abridged data scan comprising the first 31 channels\nwas collected at 12 second intervals and was generally used during transient\nruns. Also an on-line data plot of channels 2, 3, 13, 14, 15 was produced\non request. A single channel temperature recorder was also used primarily\nfor outlet temperature monitoring, but was also used for nozzle temperature\ndetermination. Flow bench, heater control, and cryopump information was\ndisplayed for the test operator\'s surveillance.\n5.1\n\nTest Chronology and Significant Events\n\nTable 3 presents the run log in two sections. The first section\ndescribes the run, description of conditions, events of significance and\ncorrective action taken due to the events of the run. The second section\nbegins at the point where modifications were effectively complete and simply\ndesignates the runs which occurred in chronological order.\nNozzle spontaneous freezing and under-temperature achievement from\nR-22 exposure proved to be of some concern initially. Early runs in which\nR-22 was sprayed from a point on the nozzle plate cooled the nozzle plate as\nlow as -23\xc2\xb0F. The routing of more warm fluid through the plate was not effective\n\n59\n\nController\n\nI\ni\n\nChamber\n\ni\nI\n\n6 Load Cel1\nN2\n;surant ...\n\n^\n\nI\n\nCryo\nPump\n1/2 SES\nDoor\nShroud\n\nDad Cell\nN2 =|\nssurant\n\nInlet\nSecondary\nOutlet Temp\n(multiple)\n, Flex\n\nFlex\nAccumulator\n\nInlet\nTemperatur \xe2\x80\xa2e\nControl\nHeater\n\nM Pump (2 in series)\n\nFlow Meter\nCooling\nH/X\n\n40\xc2\xb0 F\n\nCoolant\n(Triche)\n\nFIGURE 28 EVAPORATOR TEST FLUID LOOP SCHEMATIC\n60\n\nF11ters\n\ni.\n\nt\n\nj:\n\nr. ?i jj\n*i\xc2\xab\n\n*i r ii\n\nL: a.\n\n.1\n\ni. :\xe2\x80\xa2\n\ny\n\ns\n\na a.\n\nMS\n"i\n\nt. i.\n\xe2\x80\xa2i\nJJ ft\n\nii U\nI)\n\n1.\n1j *i\nLJ)\n\nII i.\n\nu\xc2\xbb\n\n*\n15 \',, rf\n\ns\nt\n\nI\n1)\nrf\n9\n\n* *\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2j\n\nil\n\n\'-1\n^\n\n(1\njj\n\n.n\n\n-H\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2f\n\nT\nCJ \xc2\xa3\nC E\nk\n\n1\n.\n\n>:\nj.\n\nu\n\nu\n\nr1\n\n<j\n*)\n\n1\n.\n\n31 v\n\nC\n\nM 41 >ll\n\nS\n\nI\'\n.\n\n<;\n\n1,\ni\'\n\nC M\n\nJl\n\nM 9 fl N\n\n*> H\n\nin\n\n9 9\n1) \xc2\xbb \xc2\xbb >\\\n\nrl i- H\n8\xc2\xbbH\n* 19 33\n\n\xc2\xbbi\nS\n\nr-i cii\n\nou\n$\n\nIjjiii\n\nI\nX\nU\n\n9\n\n1 \xc2\xab!\n\nb ii\n\ns\n\nL) J\n\n0\n\nn\n\nJO M P\n\n\xc2\xbb\n\n?\n\n\xc2\xbb\n\n\xc2\xbb\n\nB 9\nJ\n\ni.\n\n\xc2\xbb t\n*\n\nn\nji\nt\n\nJI\nr,\nSO\n\ns\n\nTl\n\nr\xc2\xbb\n\n-i\n\ngo\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2V\n\nS\n\nZ\n[ )\n\ni!\nrrr\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2V\n\nM\n\n?!

The dribble volume formed at each shut-off froze\nreadily to the insulator and ultimately caused build up of ice over the nozzle.\nTo remedy this, the insulation was removed for about one inch surrounding\nthe nozzles. Further testing showed that occasional droplets sprayed directly\non the lip of the insulator and froze. Even removal of the original 1/4 inch rubber\ninsulation sheet and replacement with a l/RMnch sheet,.of teflon failed to remedy the\nproblem. Upon complete removal of the insulation, one other ice build up\nwas noted on a section having residual glue about an inch below and slightly\naside of the nozzle. After removal of all the glue, no further problems of\nfreezing occurred. All of the testing after run C-5 was free of any nozzle\nfreezing problem. Other incidents during the program of insulation changes\nincluded freezing on a thermocouple wire attached to the nozzle and freezing\nof fluid leaking past the seal and around the threaded nozzle. This leaking\naggravated freezing in the presence of the insulation sheets but had no effect\non a later run with a bare plate. A later configuration in which the Freon\nspray was issued from a position farther from the water supply showed that\nthe nozzle plate cooling was no longer great enough to require the insulation\nanyway. Stemming from this experience it is recommended that no insulative\nmaterials exist within the evaporator chamber.\nSome difficulty was obtained in achieving the spray distribution\nwhich was anticipated. It was known that the spray tended to expand in\nvacuum more than at atmospheric pressure due to the relatively lower effect\nof vapor entrainment. This expansion was larger than anticipated, requiring\n\n68\n\nthe nozzle to be relocated closer to the shell. The nozzle position was\nsuccessively advanced until the entire spray fell on the evaporator surface\nwhich is active with both transport circuits. Even with this advancement\nthe area coverage was less than predicted. The sketch below shows the\ndimensions of the prototype nozzles and the old nozzles used for pattern\npredictions.\n\nCHAMFER\n\nNOZZLE\n\nd0\n\nw\n\n.060\n\n.025\n\n.037\n\n.07\n\n\xc2\xab.01\n\n.042\n\nPrototype Spraying\nSystems N-8\n\nd\n\nr\n\nCHAMFER\n\n.020\n\n.031\n\n.07\n\n*0\n\n.0595\n\n.0283\n\n.044\n\n.099\n\n=0\n\nFeasibility Test\nSpraying Systems\nN-4\n\nGeometrically\nScaled N-4\n\n.\n\nComparison of the prototype centerbody dimensions and the geometrically scaled\ndimensions indicated that some nozzle modifications were in order. Under the\nassumption that the ratio of slot area to orifice area could be a significant\nparameter, the slots were increased to .032 x .041 dimension. This change\nproduced the correct tendency but a greater effect was desired. Figures 31\nand 32 show the temperature pattern produced by the original N-8 design\nand that with enlarged slots. Further modification of\'slot dimensions to .\n.032 x .044 produced the temperature pattern shown in Figure 33. The spray pattern\nappears to be reasonably acceptable from a spray distribution standpoint,\nsince it produces a more uniform temperature drop with evaporator area (due to\nmore uniform spray deposition) than the previous two nozzles.\n69\n\no\n- o\n\n~.~1\'.~~:\',1\n\nTT;;i~r^\n\nfrrr.r\xe2\x80\x94S^t-r\n:\n\nr [ \xe2\x80\xa2 : \xe2\x80\xa2 ! -.. ! :\n\n.L-..PP\n\n-\xe2\x80\xa2"\'- tirT-\'l :i\' \'li-\'-\n\n8 NOZZLE\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 i\n\n;::ii:i \'\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2[-"\'. - ] : \xe2\x80\xa2 - \xe2\x80\xa2 . , . . -\n\n700\n\n/r\xe2\x80\x94jr\n\n,\n\n.\n\n800\n\n<T>\n\nEVAPORATOR TEMPERATURE DISTRIB\nFIGURE 3\n\nAREA\n\n2\n\nORIGINAL\n\ni!:lLl_LikLi!Q\n\nLO\n\n70\n\noo\no\nCO\n\no\nCD\n\nX\nCXI\n\noo\no\n\nCM\n\noo\ni\xe2\x80\x94i\na:\nI\xe2\x80\x94\noo\ni\xe2\x80\x94i\nQ\n\n<C\n\na:\n\no;\no\n\no:\no\n\nOJ\n\nro\n\nJo\n\n3cjniVcJ3dW31\n\n71\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 . \xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2;. . r.i.. . . .-L::;iu_;. .\n..\n.,. ..,\n\n[IS)\n\no\n\no\nCD\nX\n\no\no\nCM\n\nOQ\n\xc2\xbb\xe2\x80\x94i\n\no;\n\noo\nH-4\n\no\nLU\n(XL\n\no:\no\no\nQ.\n\n. . , . . . ,\n\n. . , . . , . . . .\n\nLlL:ijM:j.j::U;.i.;;<:;j..:\nixl ,-\xe2\x80\xa2 r.:t|i...-I:-::..::.-:\xe2\x80\xa2 \\ : - . . \\\n\nCO\n\nro\ncu\n\ndo\n\n^\n\n3biniVy3dW31\n72\n\nIn spite of the improvement in spray distribution, testing of the\nunit disclosed accumulations during operation. A plexiglas back (see Figure 34 )\nwas added to the unit through which the vaporization surface could be viewed.\nThis revealed the presence of a band located approximately 45 degrees from the\nnozzle center!ine at which frosting occurred. The frost covered approximately\na width of one and one half inches spanning some 12 tubes, and was present\non circumferentially spaced patches up to half of the evaporator girth in\nextent. The initial formation of frost had the appearance of a myriad of\nfilaments joined end-wise to the surface and having a length of one-eight\ninch. This fuzzy surface yielded to a more solid formation. This frost\nlayer built until the joint temperature was raised to a level sufficient to\ngenerate vapor which cleaved the layer from the surface. The frost layer\nthen fell to the bottom of the evaporator where it accumulated, and the\nprocess repeated.\nThe transport fluid temperature level was changed while maintaining\nconstant heat rejection. The temperature which had frost accumulation had\npreviously been at a level of 50 to 90\xc2\xb0F (wall temperatures) and were\nraised 10\xc2\xb0F with no apparent change in the frosting tendency. From this it\nwas concluded that improvements in the transport side qualities could not\nbe expected to aid the problem. Also, there were runs made at reduced load\n(120\xc2\xb0F inlet, 40\xc2\xb0F outlet) which had not shown any accumulation. (These runs\nwere made before surface viewing was initiated). For this reason, it was\nconcluded that the combination of droplet size and deposition rate were responsible for the accumulation. The simple theory of Reference 1 agrees\nwith this conclusion. As shown in Figure 35 the relative difference between\nevaporation and supply time is much more sensitive to area (flow per unit\narea) and drop thickness than to surface temperature.\nThe feasibility test nozzle used (Spraying Systems N-4) was inserted into the\nevaporator to reproduce the earlier2 test conditions. It was positioned to\ncover an area of approximately 3 ft and was flowed at 25 Ib/hr as in previous\ntesting. The evaporator vent area in this set up was double its previous value\nwhich was recognized to. possibly permit droplet freezing-in-transient. The\nlatter did not occur to a degree that inefficiency resulted. Also no frost\noccurred in the simulation of the earlier conditions. The evaporant flow\nwas raised to 28 Ib/hr at which condition frosting was observed from r=6\nto r=9 on the circular face portion of the evaporator. Temperatures on the outside\nranged from 35 to 50\xc2\xb0F in this area. The transport fluid temperature level\nwas raised 10\xc2\xb0F while the frosting persisted showing again the insensitivity\nto surface temperature. The evaporant flow was returned to 25 Ib/hr and the\nfrosting ceased. The transport temperature was reduced 5\xc2\xb0F from nominal with\nno effect (outlet temperature 35\xc2\xb0F). As the transport fluid temperature was\nreduced another 10\xc2\xb0F, frosting resumed and the outlet temperature dropped\n8\xc2\xb0F disclosing the reduced efficiency. During feasibility testing, loads to\n43 Ib/hr were achieved with the N-4 design with no evident accumulation. These\nruns were not sustained for long periods due to the inability of the smaller\npumping capacity in the vacuum chamber at that time. It is possible that the\naccumulation was (1) not noted, (2) impeded by the higher chamber pressure,\n\n73\n\nCD\nt\xe2\x80\x94(\nX\nLU\n\nJ\xe2\x80\x94\nt\xe2\x80\x944\n3\n\ncc\n\nO\nf\xe2\x80\x94\n\no\nQ-\n\nLU\n\nCO\nLU\n\ncc\nCD\n\nQ/A = 6250\n/\n\n2.0 "I\n\nQ/A = 8333\n\nQ-/A = 12500\n\n1.5\n\n1.0\n\n0.5 -\n\nEXPECTED 90 50\nTHICKNESS pet\nTHICKNESS - MICRONS\nFIGURE\n\n35\n\nEVAPORATION AND SUPPLY TIMES FOR WATER\n\n75\n\nor (3) not present due to surface or geometrical differences from the\nprototype unit. Nevertheless it became apparent that an improved spray\npattern was required to alleviate the frosting tendency.\nIn the course of nozzle trials several other variations of nozzle\ndimensions were tested. The following nozzles were installed and evaluated\n(see earlier sketch for dimensional definitions).\nNOZZLE\n\nNO.

In neither of these cases did the spray cover the\nentire area, but frosting was observed in the cylindrical portion of the\ncore. For this reason one would not expect that retracting the nozzle to\ncover more of the active surface would reduce frosting. The sprayed density\nat the critical location would be translated to a slightly larger radius due\nto the slight conical form of the "cylindrical" section. However this was\nnot expected to result in more than a 10 percent reduction in spray density,\nand therefore was not employed. Nozzle 3 was the same as employed for the\nfeasibility test and that used earlier at low load. It was repositioned\nso that the maximum spray density was located on the larger-radius cylindrical\nsection and so that the spray coverage was a larger fraction of the total\narea. This arrangement similarly provided neither a superior spray distribution nor relief from the frosting tendency. Finally, the si.x slot design\nwas employed which eliminated frost formation. This six slot nozzle was\nused in the remainder of the testing. Superficially, the spray distribution\nis inferior to the N-8 nozzle with deepened slots. However, the peak spray\ndensity is lower, less circumferential variation is present, and the droplet\nsizes are presumably smaller, due to the higher supply pressure C28 psi\ncompared to 14 psi).\nOne problem incurred with the non-frosting nozzle which was not present\nwith the frost-producing N-8 item is direct liquid carryover in the exhaust duct.\nThis carryover is perhaps 8 percent of the total flow and presumably is due to the\npresence of smaller droplets which are swept out with the vapor. These particles\nwere present in the feasibility test as evidenced by observation of frost on\nviewpoints located in the exhaust flow. Mirrors positioned for visualizing\nnozzles in upward and downward operation accumulated considerable amounts of\nice during testing.\nAnother difficulty associated with the six-slot nozzle is the spray\npattern effect on control. The control sensor i-n the "upstream" location has\n\n76\n\nbeen shown to exhibit superior response. The "upstream" position was\npresumed to be cooled at a representative rate so that the presence or\nabsence of cooling on the surface could change the sensor temperature\nsignificantly (more than 1 or 2 degrees). However, in the search for such\na position with the Del avan six-slot nozzle, the strong cooling extended\nover 90 percent of the cooling range, while the remaining 10 percent was\nrelatively diffuse cooling, producing only perhaps one or two degrees of\ncooling of the sensor relative to the fluid. One then is faced with the\n+_ 5\xc2\xb0F swings associated with the "downstream" sensor positioning or load\nsensitivity. For\n\nTsensor = Tout + v(AT) x L\n.\n\'\nWhere L is the Load fraction\nThe nearest practical position of the sensor to the outlet was at an area\n250 in^ where the temperature is 8 degrees above the outlet at full load (AT = 8)\nas shown in Figure 36. This indicates that load sensitivity of the device would\nbe approximately eight degrees over the load range. Turn "on" at low load\n(L-> 0) at 43\xc2\xb0F implies that at L\xe2\x80\x94> 1 the outlet could stabilize as low as\n35\xc2\xb0F. This approach was taken and the results are shown in Figure 37 .\nAs expected the outlet temperature sinks to 35\xc2\xb0F at near full load before\nthe evaporator achieves a true full load operation. Brief testing with the\nN-8 nozzles under control showed less load sensitivity (AT \xc2\xab -4) and could\nhave been improved by better sensor location. The control runs (C-l through\nC-4) are represented well by C-l shown in Figure 38 . Here the outlet\ntemperature trace shows a small load bias until full "on" conditions are\nachieved where the outlet is a constant difference from the inlet temperature.\nIn a progression of runs, the outlet temperature rise at maximum demand increased in proportion to the accumulation of frost in the evaporator. For,\nthe evaporation rate from surfaces covered by frost is low compared to the nonaccumulating surfaces. Thus any evaporant sprayed on the frost is "lost". As the\naccumulated frost pile increased in dimension, covering a larger fraction of\nthe evaporator, the fraction of evaporant "lost" became greater. The tendency to supply more evaporant flow to offset this apparent deficiency in load\ncapacity increases the flow per area and thus the rate of frost formation.\n5.2\n\nResults of Prototype Testing\n\nThe redundant channels were operated in each combination to evaluate\nthe uniformity of flow channels and the effect of off-center nozzles. Figure 36\nshows the outside wall temperature distribution produced for each evaporant\nposition. Four runs were made with all combinations of primary and secondary\nflow circuits and the sensor position picked at a position of coincident\ntemperature. The temperature distribution on the sensor ray is shown in\nFigure 39 for each evaporant/transport fluid circuit combination. The prospective sensor location is indicated in Figure 39 . Differences in detailed temperature distribution using the alternate transport flow channels\nwere small, as expected. Differences between supply circuits were greater,\n\n77\n\nLU\n\nM\nO\n\nOQ\n\n<\nLU\nC\xc2\xa3\n\nO\nUJ\nC\xc2\xa3\n\n<:\no;\nUJ\no.\nLU\nI\xe2\x80\x94\n\no:\no\n.\no\nCL.\n\nCO\nLU\nUL\n\n_ O\n\n78\n\nM\nM\nO\n\no 8\n\nBg\nu\n\nUJ\n\na\n\nUJ\n\nUJ\n\n5\nP\n\no:\n\nUJ\nQCtL\n\no\n\no\nO.\n\n\xc2\xa7\no\nCO\n\no\n\nI\n\nUJ\n\ncc\n\ntc\n\nUl\n\na.\nUJ\n\n79,\n\nro\nC3\n\n|ii:j JiiU!;;jii..: H.-IU-flii|i; \\l:\'i\\: ^QU^P1\nto-i.;-;--. \xe2\x80\xa2-> \xe2\x80\xa2 :-l-iiliSM^Ii.isiiil;1!\' Ill l-li^l-l.:;!\' ?\',!-:;:!\'\nT!:!:i:i;j[:::-.M?ifi;:|]:-| .^i^j-.--!!\'-::-\'!!.-;!;\'-^-!::\n\n{il\n\nj ^ , : : ^ : ^1^\ni p:]: !\n\no\nCM\n\nHI,:\n\n&|ii!l:^^\n;.4, h4,:j,;\'.|:iS::,;;j;i fe^\nr\n\n; LU \xe2\x80\x94I\n\n4\'-:\n\n=>\n\nI-H\n\n!\n\n;\xe2\x80\xa2; : \'! ; ;:,.j\'\' ";\xe2\x80\xa2\'.; i.:; i.\xe2\x80\xa2;:n]"i.-.\'\xe2\x80\xa2:\xe2\x80\xa2:!!!;:j;f!>.\xe2\x80\xa2\'\n.,;;\' i.:.;j;J|..|;^}t:i.i:.,jl4i;^!|;il^4:;,:|Hj|.\n\n\xe2\x80\x94I I\xe2\x80\x94\n2=\n\n;\n\n!\n:\xe2\x80\xa2.,}$?\nv j . ; ; .;::\';,:::.;4.,:::;,ii!;-iii:i:ir;\'1ir.!:^";ii!::;-:!(^:[vi!.: jf!lpiij\n^ li. t^l L * i . i\nl^ .\n\nii!/;!;,i;\':![^;:U;luii\n\nO\n\nfr^r.:\n\n;i\n\ni .\n\nO\n\n:\n\n. ;\n\n*:?\'*\n\np\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2 \' \xe2\x80\xa2:\xe2\x80\xa2 .

In the horizontal position all four combinations were tested\nduring the zero to maximum to zero heat load transient. Figure 40 shows the\nresults which are extremely similar in character. The experience gained from\nthis run sequence implies that the evaporator redundancy provisions can be\nengineered to be nearly equivalent in operating characteristics.\nThe effect of evaporator position during the simulated heat load\nprofile is shown in Figure 41 . In these runs the heat load bias during\nthe increasing portion of the inlet temperature ramp appears to be slightly\nstronger for the spray down orientation. However this does not continue\nfor the declining load portion of the run. Control in each position was\nto the 40 +_ 56F required with the exception of a two minute period in the spray\ndown position where the temperature was reduced as low as 32 F. Minor\nchanges in liquid supply pressure account for the differences in the 500\nto 800 second time period.\nThe effect of water supply temperature is more dramatic as shown\nin Figure 42. . in both the hot and cold evaporant supply a greater portion\nof flow is apparently directed downstream of the sensor so that the heat load\nbias is increased. It is well known that viscosity affects the droplet size\ndistribution and probably the spray spatial distribution. In addition, the\nbalance of surface tension force and vapor pressure suggests an upper droplet size which lies within the expected droplet size range for the conditions\nanticipated. At the higher supply temperature the upper droplet limit is\nconsiderably smaller than at the normal (70\xc2\xb0F) spray supply temperature.\nThe smaller droplets are more susceptible to vapor drag which tends to collapse\nthe spray pattern. Thus for both hot and cold supply temperatures the spray\ndrop size and spatial distribution are subject to considerable variation.\nThe full "on" portion of operation (from 500 to 800 seconds) disclosed\nthat the run with cold water never achieved a steady condition. No reason\nfor this action has been determined. There was no measurable accumulation\nduring the run and all inlet conditions were relatively stable. It is possible\nthat some type of viscous instability could occur since the slot hydraulic\ndiameter based Reynolds number approximates 1000. The heated supply water caused\na leak to form in the nozzle seal which allowed a significant fraction of\nliquid to pass through the threads in the nozzle. This liquid was lost to\nevaporator function for all practical purposes. The amount of heat rejection\nwas lowered by about 15% so that the outlet temperature achieved 55\xc2\xb0F during\nmaximum heat load. At the end of the run, about 1.6 Ibs of the 11 Ibs supplied\nhad accumulated so that the 15% leak rate was present at the end of the run\nin solid form.\nThe effect of high and low evaporant flow rate is shown in Figure 43.\nAt high (120% nominal) flowrate, full "on" operation is not achieved during\nthe imposed load transient, and the heat load bias of outlet temperature\nis increased. Some 12 degrees of variation from low load to high\nload occurs yielding a minimum temperature of 32\xc2\xb0F. \'At low (80% nominal) flow\nrate,the minimum outlet temperature remains above 35\xc2\xb0F, but at maximum inlet\ntemperature the outlet temperature rises to 62\xc2\xb0F reflecting the diminished\n\n82\n\nGO\n\nZ a.\n\n<\n<r O\no\n\nll\nHI CO\n\noc\na.\n\nV)\n\n(\xc2\xa3\n\na.\n\nUJ\n\nto\n\no\nUJ\nCO\n\ncc\n\na.\n\noc\na.\n\nCO\nO\n\nCD\n\ns\nCJ\n\no\n\nI\nQ\nUJ\nCO\n\nra\no\n\na:\no\nu_\ncc\nUJ\na.\na;\no\n\nH\no\na.\n\na.\no\n\nI\n\ne\nUJ\n\nUJ\n\n83\n\no\n\ng\n\xc2\xa7\n\nto in\n\no\nLU\no:\nLU\nQ.\n\nz\no\n\n"8\nUJ\nO\n\no\n\n(A\nUl\n\ns^\nin i\nQC\nO\n\nO\nCL.\n\ns\no\nto\n\no\nin\n\nin\no\n\nI\n\nUl\n\noc\n\nc\nUl\n\nQ.\n\nUl\n\n84\n\no:\n\no\nu_\noe\nLjJ\nD.\n\n<c\na:\nLU\nQ.\nUJ\n\na.\n0.\n\nn\n\na:\n^\nCD\n\nUl\n\nQC\n\noc\n\nUl\n\na.\n\n85\n\n00\n\n_ z j ujv- o n\n(O\nUJ\n\nUJ\n\nLU\nO\n\nD\n\n>\xe2\x80\xa2 >\n& *\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n0\n\n3 3\n\nC\xc2\xa3\nO\n\nn\nu\n\no:\nLU\n\nQ-\n\no\n\na\nVI\n\nO UJ\nJ= H\n\n<P\n\nZ\nI\n*\n\nC\xc2\xa3\n\nQQ-\n\nco i\n\nS\n\nO\n\n(0\n\no\nLU\nLU\nCO\nLU\nC\xc2\xa3\n\no\nUJ\n\nffi\n\n3-\n\n8\n\n\xc2\xa7\n\n\xc2\xa7\n\n86\n\n\xc2\xa7\n\nfM\n\nevaporant flow. These runs are in line with expectations except that the\nheat load bias should not be dependent on the spray rate, only upon the change\nin spray distribution.\nThe effect of increased (2100 Ib/hr) and decreased (1600 Ib/hr)\ntransport fluid flow is shown in Figure 44. In the\nhigh flow case, the inlet temperature was reduced to allow the maximum load\nlevel to attain 50,000 BTU/hr, while the inlet temperature was not raised\nproportionately for the low flow run. The controller was set inadvertently\nfor the low flow run to -1\xc2\xb0C rather than +1\xc2\xb0C so that an offset of 2\xc2\xb0C was\nbuilt into the control function. The addition of 3.6\xc2\xb0F to the outlet\ntemperature raises the level to be nearly identical to the baseline case\nand the high flow rate case as well. No significant features are judged to\ncharacterize either of these runs.\nThe enthalpy of vaporization of water in the evaporator was\ncalculated for each run. In the steady load conditions of the early set of\nnozzle runs, the data showed 1020 BTU/lb enthalpy change in situations where\nfrost accumulation was not a factor. The change in nozzles to achieve margin\nfrom accumulation was, as already noted, accompanied by direct liquid carryover in the exhaust. As would be expected this carryover resulted in a lower\nvalue of vaporization enthalpy. The enthalpy change for these runs averaged\n980 BTU/lb, which indicates approximately a four percent carryover. The\nrandom error in measurement and reduction of data is estimated at +_ 6 percent,\na band which covers the reduced data scatter. Two methods were used to\nachieve the enthalpy data: (1) heat rate per flow rate at maximum load and\n(2) integrated energy absorbed per evaporant weight consumed over the profile\nof inlet temperature. The heat rate data showed a definite tendency to exhibit\nlower enthalpy values of perhaps 30 BTU/lb. This tendency occurs even in\nthe presence of a systematic error incurred by radiation which is estimated\nto amount to less than 4 percent at maximum load and less than 2 percent\naveraged over the load profile. Correcting for the radiation influence would\nreduce the enthalpy to about 960 BTU/lb, a value effectively equivalent to\nthe 965 BTU/lb reported for the feasibility test result.\nResults for Freon operation were not obtained in as many situations\nas were run with water. Some 3700 Ibs. of Freon were expended which represents\na significant cost of expendables. After moving the Freon spray location\nsignificantly off center, it was assumed that two nozzles side-by-side would\noperate identically. Thereby only a single evaporant position was operated.\nOther runs such as heated Freon spray and a detailed survey of orientation\neffects were not conducted.\nFreon, sprayed axially from a nearly central location, forms a\ncollapsed cone of mist which exerts its cooling strongly in a small area near\nthe exhaust duct. Concomitant with this is that about 10-15% of the mist\nexits directly without being vaporized. Upon moving the Freon strongly away\nfrom the center and directing the spray at an acute angle toward the wall the\ndirect carryover was reduced to nearly zero. The strong effect of cooling\npattern on control with the type of control system utilized became an important\n\n87\n\nu.\n\nOB\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2?T\nUJ\n\nUJ\n\nQi\nLU\nQ-\n\nCM\n\nCVJ\n\nI\n\nex\n\n0\n\n"\n\n0\n\nUJ\n\n- oo 5\n\no\nQ-\n\n%\n\nO\n\no\n\nLU\n\no:\nCM\n\no\n\ng\n\n\xc2\xa7\n\nec\n\nUJ\n\na.\n\n88\n\nevaluation to conduct. This control was shown to operate satisfactorily over\nthe range of conditions expected for the shuttle. Two installations were made,\nindicating that there is not a unique position for which control may be obtained.\nThe primary operational difficulty experienced during operation of\nFreon was that of flow control. Several times it Was observed that equal\nsupply pressurization did not provide equal flow. The most probable explanation for this is that the valve used to meter Freon flow was not of \xe2\x80\xa2\nadequate size so that a large pressure drop was obtained. At some conditions,\nthe degree of supply subcooling was small so vaporization within the valve\nmay have occurred. The existence of two phase flow in the valve-to-nozzle\nline could easily provide the sensitivity noted. Another source is that\nvaporization certainly occurs in the spray nozzle. Subfreezing temperatures\nin the nozzle and the Freon flow would lead to ice as the water contained in\nthe Freon was cooled. This ice easily could change the passage dimensions\nand could persist for an uncertain duration. Such a constriction would radically\naffect the pressure drop. Further testing should be performed with a low pressure\ndrop valve and consider incorporation of a dryer for removal of the 1% water contained in commercial R-22 to assure no ice can form in the nozzle.\nThe effect of evaporator orientation is illustrated in Figure 45\nwhich compares horizontal and spray up conditions with an otherwise identical\nconfiguration. Only the down ramp portion of run C-ll is shown because the\nup ramp portion was run with the other sensor and was poorly controlled. No\nsignificant difference is disclosed due to the orientation, but the control\nwas not optimum nor was the flow sufficient at the 1 psia condition. These\nruns were made with the aluminum back cone installed.\nThe remainder of Freon runs were performed after completion of the\nwater operation. The Freon nozzle was reinstalled in the plexiglass back\nand its direction adjusted as follows. The spray was directed toward the\nevaporator surface upstream of the sensor. Its angle was then adjusted so that\nthe sensor and outlet temperatures were equal. On successive runs C-19, C-20,\nand C-21 the R-22 flow was raised above the flow required at atmospheric\nconditions to reject 50,000 BTU/hr. This was done as a result of the experience that the flow increase at lower pressure ambient was not sufficient\nto offset the reduction in enthalpy of vaporization. Run C-22 demonstrated\nthat a supply pressure reduction of 20 percent could be tolerated. Run C-23\ndemonstrated operation at 1 psia; C-24 at 3 psia; and E-7A, E-8A, and E-l at\n10 psia. Runs E-7A and E-8A also indicated the sensitivity to transport flow\nrate. E-8A had the supply pressure raised to allow for the increased load\nimposed, and the high pressure was used for run E-l which followed.\nFigure 46 shows the comparison between atmospheric, 1 psia, and\n3 psia results. This comparison indicates that the control sensitivity decreases\nat low pressure operation.\n\n89\n\no>\n\n00\n\n10\n\no:\no\nu_\nDC.\nUJ\nCL\n\nCM\n\n*- w\n\xc2\xbb- ai\nO\n\nD\nZ\n\n- S\n_\nO)\n\no;\no\n\nIJU\n\na:\no\na.\n\n00\n\no\no\n(O\n\nLLJ\nU_\nLL.\nLU\n\nin\n\nLO\nUJ\na:\nCD\n\nCO\n\nCM\n\nD\n\no\nin\n\nUl\nI .ccCM\n\n1\n\n2 < \xc2\xbb\xe2\x80\xa2\ng\n\xc2\xbb\xe2\x80\xa2 oc \xc2\xa7\n\n\xc2\xa7\n\nUl u.\n\n1\xc2\xb0\n\n90\n\ng\n\nS\n\nS\n\nCM\n\nODH.WH\xc2\xabM\n\n-Z-UIKODO\n\n*\n\n\xc2\xab Ca\n\n,-\xe2\x80\x9e*CM\nCM CM\n\nQ]\n\n0\n\n"""\n\ni\n\nCO\n.\n\nUl\n\nuis 0\n\nen\n\nCO\n*** *"*\n\nS OC <r \xc2\xbb\xe2\x80\xa2 co\n\n/^n\n\nCD\nCD\n\n(O\n\nJ\n\n,.\n\n\xc2\xa3 cc <\nS\n\xc2\xab\n\nCO\n\nl^j\n\n<J\n\n4\n\nr\xc2\xa7\n\nI9B\n<^\n\n^*)\n\n^^\n\n<o\n\n^\n\nfig\n<\n\xc2\xa9 in\n^\n\n<3\n\n<3\nCD\n\n<\no\n\n-\n\nf^\n\nu.\na:\nIII\n\nt-\n\nQ-\n\nLJLJ\n\nO\n\n\xc2\xa9 S3\n\nO\nLJ\n\n^\n^\n\n^^\n\n^\n\nW\n\ntfffifc\n\n\xc2\xa3\n\n^\nIflQ\n\nt^^\n\nLU\n\n\xc2\xa3\n\n2\n\n\xc2\xab-\n\nw\n\n^\n\xc2\xaei\n/^ ^i^\n^ @ ^\n/ H\'\n^ S ;\n\nCD\n<3\n\nOnJ\n\n^-\n\n<3\n\nCD\n\n<?i\n\n3\n\n00\n\n-\n\nUJ\n10\n\n-\n\n^\n\nO\n\n.\n\nO . . .\n\nt-\n\nt- OC\n\nCM\n\no\n\n^\n\nC\n\nH\n\n\xc2\xab "\xe2\x80\xa2\nm o\n0,\n\n91 \'\n\nO\n\nO\n\nO\n\n<0\n\n\xe2\x80\xa251-\n\nUJ\n\nftr\n\n*\n\n5f\n1\n\nO\n\n<\xc2\xbb\n\nU\n.\n\nu.\nUD\n\n\xc2\xa75\nCD\n1\xe2\x80\x94t\n\nLI-\n\nCM\n\n**\n*\n\ni S\ni i\n\nUJ\n\n^\n^i\nO *3\nO \xc2\xa9\n\nO\n\n1-\n\nt\xe2\x80\x94\n\n<3\nCD\n\n3\n\nLU\n\nu.\no\n\n\xc2\xab^\n\n<3\n\n^\n\nI\n\n^\n\nOD\n\noo\n^\n\no}"\n\ne\xc2\xa73\n\n<3\n\nw\nH\n\nZ\n\n\xe2\x80\x94\n\n4\n\nDO\n\n0\n\nUJ\nCJ\n\n^\n\xc2\xab-\n\nm\n\nO\n\nCM\n\nFigure 47 compares high supply pressure (120% nominal) with the low\nsupply pressure (80% nominal). The low pressure supply run had atmospheric\nambient pressure and the high supply pressure was conducted at 10 psia ambient\nconditions.\nFigure 48 shows the results of variation in transport flow rate\nconditions at ambient pressure of 10 psia.\nThe above runs indicate that the Freon operation exhibits the expected\nsensitivity to the wide range of operating pressure environments. In each of\nthe above runs the enthalpy of vaporization has been calculated as shown in\nTable 4 . The runs reflecting efficiencies greater than unity can have\nresulted from instrumentation accuracy or from the fact that the vapor exit\ncondition may be superheated.\nTwo switchover runs were conducted to simulate the boost and ascent\nconditions. A chamber pressure of 3 mm Hg was selected as a switching point.\nThe transition from water to Freon is shown in Figure 49 . At the switchover condition the outlet temperature had risen to about 37\xc2\xb0F from the previous 35\xc2\xb0F reflecting the rise in chamber pressure. The two records p2\nseconds between records) following switchover to Freon reflected a slight\ndecrease in temperature. This is probably due to the fluid within the\nevaporator being cooled by the Freon and still reflecting water vaporization.\nThe next 15 records (3 minutes) show an abrupt rise to 80\xc2\xb0F outlet decreasing\nto a steady condition at about 50\xc2\xb0F outlet temperature. The Freon supply\npressure was set to supply only 620 Ib/hr initially and was increased after\none minute to supply 720 Ib/hr. This apparently was the cause for the\ntemperature overshoot.\nSwitchover from Freon to water, shown in Figure 50, was done at an unknown pressure. The chamber pressure instrumentation was sensitive to gas composition and during Freon operation effectively was inoperative. (A pressure sensor\nspecifically ordered for this test was not delivered). The Freon operation\nwas started at full load and the outlet temperature rose to 60\xc2\xb0F. The chamber\npumps were full on and the liquid nitrogen cryopump was operative. Water flow\nwas initiated and the outlet temperature rose quickly to 70\xc2\xb0F (about 20\nseconds), then rose slowly to 85\xc2\xb0F and then decayed. After about seven minutes\nof water operation the outlet temperature was returned to 45\xc2\xb0F. It is suspected\nthat the transition to water was attempted at a pressure above the triple\npoint and the achievement of 45\xc2\xb0F outlet was restrained by the chamber pump\ndown capability. One reason for the delay is that even though the Freon\ncould be collected by the LN\xc2\xa3 cryopump, some liquid dripped on the chamber\nwall where it reevaporated.

Then, the transport\nfluid begins to warm the nozzle by convectipn until the next valve opening.\nThe actual values of THIGH and ^LOW achieved varied depending on the mode of\nliquid attachment to the nozzle.

Of the four cases of ice\nformation, two were during visual observation and it is believed that the\nmode of freezing was the same for the other two. The amount of cooling reflected at the nozzle surface amounted generally to a 6 to 8\xc2\xb0F drop, and\n\n99\n\noccasionally 10\xc2\xb0F. The warming characteristics of the evaporant flow amounted\nto about a 2\xc2\xb0F nozzle temperature rise with a 20\xc2\xb0F potential in the one second\nflow duration. The heating is then expected to be of the form\nT = Ta+\n\n(Ts - Ta)(l-e--U)\n\n.\n\nHere Ta is the temperature approached just prior to nozzle pulsing, Ts is the\nsupplied water temperature and T(t) is the nozzle temperature during water\nflow. The amount of heat supplied by the transport flow typically produced\na rise from 49\xc2\xb0 F to 57\xc2\xb0F in 19 seconds with the transport fluid at 65\xc2\xb0F.\nThe simple heating formula which results is\nT\n\n= Ti + <Tt -Ti\nOne can use these equations to estimate the lowest temperature which could\nbe achieved for conditions other than those tested. For example, with water\nsupplied at 40\xc2\xb0F and a transport fluid temperature at 42\xc2\xb0F, a one second\npulse followed by a forty second off period will produce the following\npattern.\nTH = Ta + (40 - Ta)(.l)\n\n.\n\nTH = highest temperature\n\nT, = lowest temperature = T^ - 10\xc2\xb0F\nTa = TL + (42 - TL)(.764)\nThis set results in Ta = 38.9 so that Ti is 29\xc2\xb0F. The actual minimum value\nof Ti may be pursued readily knowing the relation of on and off time is related to the inlet temperature of Freon 21. Continuing this approach, one.\ndetermines that the lowest temperature is achieved when the time for warming\nis least. The quickest total cycling observed was about six seconds. The\ndifference in inlet Freon and nozzle temperature must be large enough that\nten degrees of warding is produced in the six seconds, or about 50\xc2\xb0F therefore\nthe lowest temperature is not more than 50\xc2\xb0F below the inlet temperature.\nFrom these observations, temperatures below about 25\xc2\xb0F should not have\noccurred at any operating condition.\n5.3\n\nRecommended Design and Engineering Based On Test Outcome\n\n1.\nNo insulative materials should be used for the evaporator inner construction, particularly near the nozzles since such surfaces cause the formation\nof ice within the device.\n2.\nThe further reduction of nozzle holdup volume will increase the margin\nfrom freezing tendencies, and will increase the efficiency. Although no\nnozzle freezing was observed after the removal of insulating material or\ninstrumentation wires, the holdup volume was observed to not vaporize completely.\nThe ice chips formed are possible sites for frost growth and also represent\na slight efficiency loss.\n\nTOO\n\n3.\nThe formation of frost on active surfaces with some nozzles resulted\nfrom combinations of large droplets and locally dense spray patterns. The\nfurther investigation of this tendency should be explored by direct measurement\nof spray density and droplet size during the next development phase.\nAdditionally, the nozzle spray pattern should be selected to eliminate liquid\ncarryover in the exhaust flow which could result in possible freezing of the\nexhaust duct.\n4.\nThe on/off temperature switched method of evaporant control has proven\nto be sensitive to the spray pattern. The position chosen for the sensor was\nabout 8 to 10\xc2\xb0F above the temperature of the ideal location. Also, particularly\nfor Freon operation, slight directional variations can produce large variations\nin outlet temperature.\n5.\nThe margin on the evaporative side was shown to be larger than previously demonstrated. During feasibility testing outlet temperatures to 34\xc2\xb0F\nwere produced, while in the prototype testing, the outlet temperature was\nbrought deliberately as low as 30\xc2\xb0F before any inefficiency was realized.\nThis fact implies that (1) a greater value of Tw-Tf|uic| \'(or less heat transfer\ncoefficient) could be adopted permitting lower pressure drop, (2) a lower\ncontrol point can be adopted with no penalty.\n6.0\n\nREFERENCES\n\n1.\n\nJ.
