b'SOLAR CYCLE #24 AND THE SOLAR DYNAMO\n\nKenneth Schatten*\na.i. solutions, Inc. suite 215\n10001 Derekwood Lane\nLanham, MD 20706\nand\nW. Dean Pesnell\nCode 671\nNASA/GSFC\nGreenbelt, MD 20771\n\nABSTRACT\nWe focus on two solar aspects related to flight dynamics. These are the solar dynamo and long-term solar\nactivity predictions. The nature of the solar dynamo is central to solar activity predictions, and these predictions are\nimportant for orbital planning of satellites in low earth orbit (LEO). The reason is that the solar ultraviolet (UV) and\nextreme ultraviolet (EUV) spectral irradiances inflate the upper atmospheric layers of the Earth, forming the\nthermosphere and exosphere through which these satellites orbit. Concerning the dynamo, we discuss some recent\nnovel approaches towards its understanding. For solar predictions we concentrate on a \xe2\x80\x9csolar precursor method,\xe2\x80\x9d in\nwhich the Sun\xe2\x80\x99s polar field plays a major role in forecasting the next cycle\xe2\x80\x99s activity based upon the BabcockLeighton dynamo. With a current low value for the Sun\xe2\x80\x99s polar field, this method predicts that solar cycle #24 will\nbe one of the lowest in recent times, with smoothed F10.7 radio flux values peaking near 130\xc2\xb1 30 (2 \xcf\x83), in the 2013\ntimeframe. One may have to consider solar activity as far back as the early 20th century to find a cycle of\ncomparable magnitude. Concomitant effects of low solar activity upon satellites in LEO will need to be considered,\nsuch as enhancements in orbital debris. Support for our prediction of a low solar cycle #24 is borne out by the lack\nof new cycle sunspots at least through the first half of 2007. Usually at the present epoch in the solar cycle (~7+\nyears after the last solar maximum), for a normal size following cycle, new cycle sunspots would be seen. The lack\nof their appearance at this time is only consistent with a low cycle #24. Polar field observations of a weak magnitude\nare consistent with unusual structures seen in the Sun\xe2\x80\x99s corona. Polar coronal holes are the hallmarks of the Sun\xe2\x80\x99s\nopen field structures. At present, it appears that the polar coronal holes are relatively weak, and there have been\nmany equatorial coronal holes. This appears consistent with a weakening polar field, but coronal hole data must be\nscrutinized carefully as observing techniques have changed. We also discuss new solar dynamo ideas, and the\nSODA (SOlar Dynamo Amplitude) index, which provides the user with the ability to track the Sun\'s hidden,\ndynamo magnetic fields throughout the various stages of the Sun\xe2\x80\x99s cycle. Our solar dynamo ideas are a\nmodernization and rejuvenation of the Babcock-Leighton original idea of a shallow solar dynamo, using modern\nobservations that appear to support their shallow dynamo viewpoint. We are in awe of being able to see an object\nthe size of the Sun undergoing as dramatic a change as our model provides in a few short years. The Sun, however,\nhas undergone changes as rapid as this before! The weather on the Sun is at least as fickle as the weather on the\nEarth.\nINTRODUCTION\nThis paper will concentrate on solar prediction requirements of flight dynamics. Namely, these are the solar\ndynamo and long-term solar activity predictions. The reason both are included is that the solar dynamo drives solar\nactivity and future activity levels are an important component in orbital decay of satellites in low Earth orbit (LEO).\nChanges in the short wavelength irradiance of the Sun affect the upper atmospheric density and the drag on satellites\n*\n\nWork performed under NASA MOMS Contract (NNG04DA01C)\n\n1\n\nin LEO; these changes strongly impact the orbital paths and lifetimes of satellites in LEO. The particular predictions\nare related to our understanding of the solar dynamo. Our ability to predict the Sun\xe2\x80\x99s dynamo is further dependent\nupon a methodology formulated several decades ago and dynamo theories previously developed by Babcock and\nLeighton in the 1960\xe2\x80\x99s. This paper\xe2\x80\x99s sections are: an historical perspective, the solar dynamo, a prediction for solar\ncycle #24, observations related to the Sun\xe2\x80\x99s polar magnetic field, the dynamo as a shallow percolation process, and\nsummary and conclusions.\nHISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE\nThe short wavelength solar irradiance is greatly affected by the Sun\xe2\x80\x99s activity, varying by a few percent in the\nultraviolet (UV) to more than 100% at some wavelengths in the extreme ultraviolet (EUV) over a solar cycle.\nTherefore, predicting the solar irradiance requires a prediction of solar activity. Although sunspot number, Rz, is\ngenerally used by solar physicists as an index of solar activity because of its long record of use, space scientists,\nparticularly the orbit determination community, have more commonly used the spectral irradiance at a wavelength\nof 10.7 cm (F10.7) as a general and accessible measure of the Sun\xe2\x80\x99s activity. Radiation at this wavelength provides\na more linear index to the strength of the short wavelength variations occurring in the solar corona (the UV and,\nmore importantly, the EUV), which affect the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s thermosphere and exosphere. Sunspot number is a\nphotospheric feature, with the photosphere being the source of the Sun\xe2\x80\x99s visible radiation, and hence, is a better\nindex for the varying output of sunlight. However, the visible variations are only ~0.2%, whereas the shorter\nwavelengths vary from a percent to 100s of percent throughout the solar cycle.\nMethods for solar activity forecasting were outlined in a report of a NOAA panel convened to forecast the\nstrength of Solar Cycle 23 (ref. 1) and updated more recently for Solar Cycle 24 (ref. 2). Many of them are\nnumerological, that is, based upon various methods simply because a mathematical method exists to perform the\ncalculations. The best example of such a numerical or numerological scheme that had been used extensively in the\npast but is not practiced today is Fourier analysis of the sunspot time series. We all know how to do this, and\ntherefore the method is so enticing that we are immediately drawn to it, secure in the knowledge that \xe2\x80\x9cwe know what\nwe are doing.\xe2\x80\x9d What we really know is not why Fourier analysis should work, but rather the details of the\nmathematical procedure we are using. Fourier developed these ideas about 200 years ago, and it has been shown that\nany sufficiently well-behaved time series can be represented by a set of Fourier coefficients. For the purpose\nintended, i.e., of obtaining a complete set of orthonormal functions that allow a reasonable function to be described,\nFourier analysis works fine. The method has sufficient degrees of freedom to represent any index we dare predict,\nhowever, we now know that these methods cannot be used for chaotic systems. The reason is that for a chaotic\nsystem, there is often more information beyond the index that one is trying to predict, and that recent past data is\nmore significant than older data, as chaotic systems lose information with time. Thus the extendibility of predicting\ninto the future is increasingly limited unless new data is forthcoming. As weather forecasters have discovered, our\nwindow into the future is limited by the nature of the chaotic system. Fourier analysis, however, has its coefficients\ndetermined equally by data at the beginning of the data set, as by data at its end, so it treats all data equally without\nregard to its temporal relevance. Because of the chaos inherent in atmospheric dynamics, weather forecasters do not\nuse Fourier analyses to determine the temperature of various cities, because there is no physical or causal link\nbetween Fourier analysis and the temperature at a location. Thus the physics is more important than the\nnumerological scheme. So too, the use of many, many methods of predicting solar activity have no physical basis,\nbut exist only because they are attractive to a particular user.\nThus we focus our discussion of prediction techniques on our solar \xe2\x80\x9cprecursor\xe2\x80\x9d method. We use the term\nprecursor to mean a parameter that has variations correlated with and preceding the solar activity that we are\nattempting to predict. For this parameter, we should settle only for a physical quantity that may plausibly be causally\nconnected to solar activity. The original precursors were geomagnetic; these were found by the Ohls (ref. 3). The\ncorrelations found by the Ohls were very high, but there was no known physical connection or causal agent for their\nfindings. The difference between a correlation between parameters and a causal agent (which has been called a\nprecursor in this field of study) may be understood by considering the following scenario. A cock crows at sunrise\nevery morning. There is a correlation; the cock crows before each sunrise, but the cock presumably does not cause\nthe Sun to rise. The physical cause, or causality, is not associated with the cock\xe2\x80\x99s behavior and the subsequent\nsunrise. In a private discussion with Ohl\xe2\x80\xa0, he said he did not consider that there might be a solar connection as a\n\xe2\x80\xa0\n\nOhl, A. I., private communication, 1990.\n\n2\n\nphysical cause for his findings. It was a mystery how the Sun could broadcast knowledge of its future activity level.\nYet the correlations were extremely high (>95%). We found a solution involving a physical parameter, the strength\nof the Sun\xe2\x80\x99s polar magnetic field, which could affect both the geomagnetic storms the Ohls were seeing and future\nsolar activity (ref. 3). Thus we were able to turn a surprisingly high correlation between the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s geomagnetic\nfluctuations with future solar activity, which appeared not to have any obvious causal relationship into a useful\nforecasting tool using solar precursors. The lack of a causal relationship was troubling, as there did not seem to be a\nway that geomagnetic activity could affect the Sun\xe2\x80\x99s dynamo. Nevertheless, turning Ohls\xe2\x80\x99 findings into a useful\nforecasting tool would likely not have been possible had the clue that the Ohls provided not been present, nor had\nthe dynamo views of Babcock and Leighton not been developed. Essentially, a jigsaw puzzle was laid down before\nus, and we simply assembled the precut pieces.\nWe began by using the polar fields of the Sun to predict solar activity based upon the dynamo views, wherein\nthe polar field is magnified by dynamo effects (ref. 4). This method has a physical basis rather than a purely\nnumerical basis. The term \xe2\x80\x9cprecursor\xe2\x80\x9d has been applied to geomagnetic and solar prediction techniques using\nsignals that precede solar activity, much as in terrestrial meteorology, where low atmospheric pressure often\nprecedes rain. The solar dynamo method was first tested with 8 prior solar cycles before being published in 1978.\nThis method has a physical basis rather than only the numerical basis that most other schemes involve. With\nregard to the geomagnetic and solar precursor methods, the basis is the solar dynamo theory, which we will\ndiscuss in the next section. Let us mention here, however, we use the most respected solar dynamo understanding\nof the Sun\xe2\x80\x99s fields: the Babcock (ref. 5)-Leighton (ref. 6) dynamo models. In their models, although it was not\nrecognized as a possible predictive technique, the polar field at solar minimum serves as a \xe2\x80\x9cseed\xe2\x80\x9d for the toroidal\nfield that erupts into the next cycle\xe2\x80\x99s activity. Further support for the polar field precursor model comes from a\nrecent modeling effort by Wang, Lean, and Sheeley (ref. 7), where it was found that the initial polar field\ncorrelated with solar cycle amplitude for cycles -3 through 22 using a flux transport model.\nWe shall be using the terms \xe2\x80\x9cpoloidal\xe2\x80\x9d to describe the North-South, or meridional component of the solar\nmagnetic field and \xe2\x80\x9ctoroidal\xe2\x80\x9d for the East-West, or longitudinal component of the Sun\xe2\x80\x99s magnetism. The NorthSouth fields of the Sun are sometimes described as \xe2\x80\x9cpolar\xe2\x80\x9d and sometimes as \xe2\x80\x9cpoloidal.\xe2\x80\x9d The polar field describes\nonly the poloidal magnetic field that emanates out the poles of the Sun. These are limited to very high latitudes\n(>60 degrees), whereas the poloidal field describes any magnetism that has a N-S component. Since much of the\npoloidal field often translates into subsequent polar field, we often examine all sources of poloidal field, although\nthey have not yet reached the polar latitudes. The East-West fields are often described by solar dynamo theorists as\ntoroidal, as generic description of fields that are primarily longitudinal. Sunspot fields are primarily toroidal, but\nthey have a key poloidal component too, owing to the tilt of active regions. This tilt is an important aspect of\ndynamo evolution, as it is through this tilt that the toroidal component transforms into poloidal components. In any\ncase, we shall be using the two terms: poloidal and toroidal generically to refer to the orientation of the Sun\xe2\x80\x99s\nmagnetism as meridional vs. longitudinal.\nWe can understand how the methods work, as follows. Using a combination of poloidal and toroidal fields,\nSchatten and Pesnell (ref. 8) create a SODA (SOlar Dynamo Amplitude) index as an estimate of the amount of\nburied solar magnetic flux. Often in their studies, proxies have been used for these components, when they were\nmore readily available for the direct field observations. To understand the basic nature of their equation, let us\nexamine the case of low toroidal field. Their equation then simplifies to:\nF10.7 ~ 60 + 1.14 Bp,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere F10.7 is the predicted future peak of solar radio flux, and Bp is the current polar field in units of 10-2 Gauss.\nThe polar field is used here, rather than the poloidal field, as in the Babcock-Leighton theory it is the polar field at\nsolar minimum which is regenerated into future toroidal field and hence solar activity. Thus, for a current value near\n0.5 Gauss, the equation yields a prediction of 117 for peak F10.7. The stronger the polar field, the larger the level of\nfuture solar activity predicted. A more recent update to the equation shows a slightly higher second constant of about\n1.2. Recently, the prediction has been updated to a value of 130\xc2\xb1 30 (2\xcf\x83) for peak smoothed F10.7. Below, we\ndiscuss the Sun\xe2\x80\x99s polar field precursor method with recent field data, as well as some modern developments of solar\ndynamo theory that can augment the Babcock-Leighton picture.\n\n3\n\nSince 1978, our methods have predicted three solar cycles quite well. Figure 1 shows F10.7 radio flux data, in\nunits of 10-22 J s-1 m-2 Hz-1, over the past 50 years, along with the past three predictions. Cycle #23 extends from\n1996 through approximately 2007, with cycle #24 starting thereafter. Examining Figure 1, one notes that the timing\nof earlier cycles was off by roughly one year. We have been improving the timing methods. Nevertheless, the\nstochastic nature of solar activity results in some variations that are not readily eliminated in advance. The amplitude\npredictions, however, have an excellent track record.\nF10.7 Observations and Predicts\nObservations\n\nPredicted in Advance\n\n300\n\n250\n\nRadio Flux, F10.7\n\n200\n\n150\n\n100\n\n50\n\n0\n1970\n\n1975\n\n1980\n\n1985\n\n1990\n\n1995\n\n2000\n\n2005\n\n2010\n\n2015\n\n2020\n\nYear\n\nFigure 1.

Cycle #21 peaked ~1980; cycle #22 ~1990; cycle #23\n~2000; and cycle #24 is predicted to peak ~2013.\nTHE SOLAR DYNAMO\nLet us briefly review some key aspects of the Sun\xe2\x80\x99s dynamo that relate to our prediction method. Babcock\ndescribed the magnetic dynamo as a basic oscillation of the Sun, wherein the polar fields of the Sun are wrapped up\nby differential rotation in the shallow layers of the Sun, and then erupt to form sunspots or active regions. The\npreceding and following sunspot groups are distinguished by the letters p and f, and this distinction is shown in\nFigure 2 from Babcock\xe2\x80\x99s drawings. The preceding and following fluxes are noted particularly in these kinds of\ndrawings, as they relate to the discovery by Hale et al. (ref. 9) of the manner in which they relate to the polar fields.\nThis allows us to distinguish \xe2\x80\x9cold cycle sunspots\xe2\x80\x9d from \xe2\x80\x9cnew cycle sunspots,\xe2\x80\x9d and this is a key as to how the\ndynamo is progressing in time. Thus, at present (mid 2007) we are seeing only old cycle sunspots, which leads us to\nbelieve that cycle #24 will be late and quite probably smaller than recent cycles.\n\n4\n\nBabcock\xe2\x80\x99s dynamo view\n\nFigure 2: Babcock\xe2\x80\x99s Field pictures. On the left is shown how shallow fields in the convection zone\nerupt to form sunspots. On the right is shown the polar dipole field and the low latitude active region\nfields (sunspots). The various dashed lines with the letters: a\xe2\x80\x99s and b\xe2\x80\x99s refer to reconnection of field as\nthe solar cycle progresses. The +\xe2\x80\x99s and \xe2\x80\x93\xe2\x80\x98s refer to field polarities.\nFigure 3 shows the overall time history of the Babcock-Leighton picture. This provides a classical, generally\nwell-accepted model for the Sun\xe2\x80\x99s dynamo that explains many observed solar features. Unlike a battery-generated\ndynamo model, where currents flow as the result of differing electron-ion behaviors, in a magneto-hydrodynamic\n(MHD) dynamo model (which the Babcock-Leighton dynamo is), the medium is regarded as an ideal fluid, with\ncurrents and magnetic fields being magnified from pre-existing magnetic fields. It is generally believed the Sun\xe2\x80\x99s\nactivity results from such an MHD dynamo. Thus, searching for the source of such fields can lead to understanding\nthe nature of the next solar cycle from the pre-existing detritus field left over from the last cycle. This was\nessentially inherent in the Babcock-Leighton dynamo, but its usefulness was not employed until a decade later (ref.\n5).\nIn the Babcock-Leighton view an oscillation between the Sun\xe2\x80\x99s toroidal field (the East-West fields which erupt\nto form sunspot fields) and the poloidal field (which extends through the Sun\xe2\x80\x99s polar regions) occurs. In summary,\nthe Sun\'s polar fields near solar minimum are wrapped up by differential rotation to form the toroidal fields (which\nfloat to the Sun\'s surface to form active regions during solar maximum). As these fields then dissipate, they\nregenerate the polar field, allowing the solar cycle to recur. The remnants of the last cycle thus serve as \xe2\x80\x9cseeds\xe2\x80\x9d for\nthe next cycle. Modern helioseismological studies have shed new light on the Sun\'s dynamo; nevertheless, the broad\nviews outlined by Babcock, Leighton, and Hale, et al. (ref. 9) still remain valid.\n\n5\n\nFigure 3: The Babcock-Leighton Dynamo: the Sun\'s polar fields near solar minimum (a) are wrapped\nup by differential rotation (b) to form toroidal fields (c). These fields, later in the cycle, float to the\nSun\'s surface and erupt (d) to form active regions containing sunspots (e). The breakup of these active\nregion fields regenerates the Sun\'s polar field with a reverse sign (f), allowing the process to repeat 11\nyears later, anti-symmetrically.\n\nThe Babcock-Leighton picture provides the key to understanding how to estimate the Sun\'s buried magnetic\nflux, and allowing it to be utilized to predict solar activity. The actual solar dynamo is neither as simplified nor\n"perfect," in terms of perfectly reproducing itself, as suggested by Figure 3, but rather is subject to the vagaries of\nfield magnification within the turbulent convection zone of the Sun. Hence, during an 11-year solar cycle, the\namplification sometimes regenerates more polar field and sometimes less, leading to irregular growth and/or decay\nof the solar cycle. This is well known to solar physicists; as Figure 4 shows, the cycles fluctuate in amplitude. Of\nparticular note are the sharp downturns in activity within a single solar cycle that occurred at the end of the 18th and\n19th centuries.\nLet us place the current method of solar activity against the backdrop of other methods, of which there are\nnumerous methods. Here one must try to separate the wheat from the chaff, in a field that can only have a small\nlimited number of \xe2\x80\x9ccorrect\xe2\x80\x9d methods, that is overridden with differing methodologies. A decade ago, a NOAA panel\n(ref. 1) chose the following general solar forecasting categories: Even/Odd Behavior, Spectral, Recent Climatology,\nClimatology, Neural Networks, and Precursors. \xe2\x80\x9cPrecursors\xe2\x80\x9d were defined to be observations that served as a\nleading indicator of the size of the upcoming solar cycle. This is similar to how a low pressure in the earth\xe2\x80\x99s\natmosphere can serve as a precursor to rain. There is a relationship governed by physical laws that can be used as a\npredictor. The \xe2\x80\x9cprecursor\xe2\x80\x9d category was further divided into solar and geomagnetic precursors. The solar precursor\nmethod performed better than the geomagnetic precursors for this last cycle; it is the method we use, and will be the\nfocus of this paper. The solar precursor method exploits some of the physical basis for changing solar activity and\nthe non-random variations. For more information on solar activity prediction methods, including precursor methods,\nthe NOAA panel discussions (ref. 1) provide an excellent source.\n\n6\n\nIn addition to amplitude variations, a Fourier spectrum of solar activity shows "power" in a wide variety of\nperiods beyond the famous 11-year Schwabe periodicity. Additionally, variations exist both on longer and shorter\ntimescales. Further, amplitudes of the cycles vary by more than 100%, in a stochastic manner. Even beyond this,\ntime spans exist, e.g. during the "Maunder minimum" of the 17th century (and other similar epochs), during which\nsolar activity dropped precipitously to near zero. The numbering on the chart also illustrates the "Even/Odd" effect,\nwhere this past century\xe2\x80\x99s (and most of the previous century\xe2\x80\x99s) odd numbered cycles have always been larger than\nthe previous even numbered cycle (e.g., cycle #21 > cycle #20, cycle #19 > cycle #18, etc.).\n\nInternational/Zurich Sunspot Number vs. Year\n\n200\n180\n\nInternational Sunspot Number\n\n160\n140\n120\n100\n80\n60\n40\n20\n\n1 2 3 4\n0\n1700\n\n1750\n\n51\n\n1800\n\n6 789\n\n5\n10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23\n\n1850\n\n1900\n\n1950\n\n2000\n\nTime, Years\n\nFigure 4: International/Zurich Sunspot Number vs. Time for the Past Few Centuries. The graph also shows the\nnumbered cycles, #1-23, as well as cycles prior to the Schwabe numbering system. As can be seen, variations in\nbasic sunspot number can exceed 100% from cycle to cycle. This does not show the full solar variation, as periods\nof time prior to this graph exist where sunspot number was much lower than shown here, and much higher as well!\nIf the Sun\xe2\x80\x99s dynamo were fairly linear (as in the Babcock-Leighton model), then one would expect a direct\ncorrelation between the number of active regions formed in that cycle with the strength of the Sun\'s polar field near\nthe cycle\xe2\x80\x99s previous solar minimum. In this view, since the polar field of the Sun is later amplified into the sunspot\nfields, one can use it as a precursor or predictor of solar activity, for that cycle. Namely, by monitoring the observed\nmagnetic fields of the Sun, one can use these observations to predict future levels of solar activity. Similar to the\nway meteorologists monitor atmospheric pressure regions to predict cloud formation, one only uses current data, and\ndoes not rely upon older past data that spectral methods utilize. Hence it is a "physics-based" forecasting technique,\nwhich uses recent observations to forecast future solar activity. To validate the dynamo method, 8 solar cycles of\nhistorical data were used to test the methods, and reasonable correlations were found (ref. 4). These 8 cycles were\nnot \xe2\x80\x9cpredictions\xe2\x80\x9d since they were not undertaken in advance, nevertheless, this paper made the first prediction using\nthe solar dynamo method. Also actual polar field observations were not available, and only \xe2\x80\x9cproxy polar field data\xe2\x80\x9d\nwere employed. The method used actual solar magnetic field observations to predict the 3 past solar cycles. We\nnow make a fourth solar cycle prediction for the next decade.\n\n7\n\nA PREDICTION FOR SOLAR CYCLE #24\nThe SOlar Dynamo Amplitude (SODA) index provides a continuous measure of the strength of the magnetic\nfield buried within the Sun\'s interior. Since the magnetic field in the interior of the Sun is "buoyant" (as the magnetic\nfield pressure tends to exclude plasma), the field acts like a gas in a liquid (e.g., carbon dioxide inside a carbonated\ndrink). Hence, the SODA index terminology is not only an acronym, but also a descriptor of the amount of magnetic\n"fizz" inside the Sun\'s interior. Figure 5 shows the SODA index in recent times. It has been decreasing during the\npast decade, suggesting that solar cycle #24 will be smaller than past cycles. Let us also examine the polar field\nstrength levels more directly, and use them for a prediction of the next cycle, to provide some validation.\nSODA index vs time, years\n250\n\nPolar Field (soda units)\n\nToroidal proxy (radio flux)\n\nSODA index\n\n200\n\nSODA Index\n\n150\n\n100\n\n50\n\n0\n1975\n\n1980\n\n1985\n\n1990\n\n1995\n\n2000\n\n2005\n\n2010\n\nTime, years\n\nFigure 5. The SODA index is a composite index allowing us to monitor the "buried magnetic flux"\npresent in the Sun\'s ever-changing dynamo.\n\nAt the present time, near solar minimum, the key component is the Sun\xe2\x80\x99s polar field. The Sun\xe2\x80\x99s polar field\nreversed near the peak activity of cycle #23 (year 2000), and began its growth toward a new peak with opposite\npolarity. Figure 6 shows the Wilcox Solar Observatory (WSO) polar field strength measured in the pole-most 3 arcminute aperture approximately every 10 days (lighter lines), and the smoothed values with a ~500 day low band pass\nfilter (heavier line). During the interval Nov. 2000 and July 2001, the WSO had some equipment problems, and the\nreal fields are likely stronger than those observed; however, this is not near peak polar fields. The Mount Wilson\nObservatory observations show similar behavior (ref. 10). The Sun\xe2\x80\x99s field, being a complex summation of surface\nfeatures, often described by spherical harmonic components does not show a reversal as neatly as suggested by\nFigure 5; the north polar field reversed near 2000, and the south field near 2001. After polar field reversal, the\nsmoothed mean polar field rose slowly, and is currently near half the value of that in recent cycles.\n\n8\n\nPolar Field, Gauss\n\n1976\n\n1994\n\n2008\n\nFigure 6: The polar field (10-6 T equal to Gauss) as observed at Wilcox Solar Observatory (WSO).\nThe solid line is the North polar field, and the dashed line, the Southern field. The yearly cycle as the\nEarth moves \xc2\xb1 7 \xc2\xbc degrees in heliocentric latitude modulates the signal and averages over a year are\nused as an index. The recent polar field is significantly lower than during the previous 3 solar cycles.\nThe year 1976 is the start of the solar data, and the year 2008 is on the right. Polar fields peak near\nsolar minimum and reverse near solar maximum.\nWith the current polar field seen in Figure 6 significantly smaller than the peaks of the past three decades, the\nSODA method (ref. 8) and the polar field precursor method both predict a decreased activity level for the upcoming\nsolar cycle #24. This can be roughly estimated as follows. The SODA (SOlar Dynamo Amplitude) index combines\npolar and toroidal solar fields to create an index, useful for examining the buried solar magnetic flux. Estimated\nlevels are found from field updates of SODA indices. The predicted timing of the cycle has an uncertainty on the\norder of \xc2\xb1 1 year. The timing has been based upon the current latitude of active regions (~ a few degrees latitude),\nsuggesting the Sun is very near solar minimum. In accord with the SODA index formula provided by Schatten and\nPesnell, the current prediction of smoothed Radio Flux, F10.7, for cycle #24 is 130\xc2\xb1 30 (2 \xcf\x83) in the 2013\ntimeframe, corresponding to a smoothed sunspot number, Rz, of about 80\xc2\xb1 30.

In addition to the reduced levels of the directly observed fields, there are a\nnumber of other relevant observations that support the direct polar field observations. They include an examination\nof soft X-ray coronal holes, coronal field calculations, and counts of polar faculae. I will only discuss the first\nobservations, although the last two also support the same implications as does the reduced polar field.\nAn examination of soft X-ray coronal holes was performed to examine what was happening to the Sun\xe2\x80\x99s large\nscale magnetic field. We sought an answer to the question: why and how could the Sun\xe2\x80\x99s field dissipate so rapidly?\nThe reduced field patterns seen at the two observatories previously cited suggests that something may have occurred\nto the structure of the large scale solar magnetic field, different from the normal polar reversal seen in recent cycles.\nThe terms in quotes in the following, refer to the manner in which solar physicists designate aspects such as polarity\nof active region magnetic fields. In the normal reversal, the field is weakened by \xe2\x80\x9cflux injection events\xe2\x80\x9d from the\n\xe2\x80\x9cfollowing\xe2\x80\x9d polarity magnetic fields of active regions at the sunspot latitudes. These flux injection events in the\nearly phase of a solar cycle reverse the polar field, while later in the cycle they form and magnify \xe2\x80\x9copposite\xe2\x80\x9d polarity\npolar fields.\nOnce a polar field forms, it is normally readily identified in soft X-ray photos seen from space, where it forms a\ncoronal hole. The reason there is a \xe2\x80\x9chole\xe2\x80\x9d in soft X-rays is that the energetic particles flow freely from \xe2\x80\x9copen\xe2\x80\x9d field\nlines, and hence, leave them dark. Figure 8a shows a drawing from Harvey and Recely (ref. 11), based upon the He\n10830 line. Figure 8b and 8c show X-ray images of the Sun in 2005 and 2007, respectively. In soft X-rays, all the\nunipolar magnetic regions (UMRs) become evident as coronal holes, similar to the ground-based observations in the\nHe 10830 line. For the present time period (Figure 8c), we see that only quite weak, asymmetric polar coronal holes\nhave formed. This is atypical of coronal holes near solar minimum. The low latitude coronal holes seen in 2005\n(Figure 8b) were floating around the solar disk (in longitude) as the Sun rotates with only weak holes located near\nthe safe harbors of the Sun\xe2\x80\x99s polar regions. The polar regions of the photosphere can serve as harbors for stable large\nscale UMRs since only at the poles does differential rotation cease. At other locations (lower latitudes), temporal\nvariations are generally larger due to shear, meridional flow, and active region effects. As a result, low latitude\nUMRs are subject to continuous change (over months/years). Thus the low latitude 2005 coronal holes, seen in\nFigure 8b, gradually dissolve by 2007 (Figure 8c). Polar coronal holes usually form a lot sooner in the solar cycle,\n\n10\n\nand appear to have a larger size, than those seen in Figures 8b and 8c. We note that there are uncertainties in the use\nof coronal hole data since observing techniques have changed over decadal timescales.\nWe do not fully understand the reasons for the current reduction in the Sun\xe2\x80\x99s polar field. Possible reasons are\nchanges in the Sun\xe2\x80\x99s meridional flow or changes in the movement of large scale fields during their reversal phase.\nFor highly conducting plasmas, the magnetic fields are \xe2\x80\x9cfrozen\xe2\x80\x9d to the fluid motions. Thus, flows and field motions\nare alternative ways of expressing similar views. Additionally, when a strong density boundary occurs (e.g. the\nphotosphere), the fluid motions have a near zero component normal to the surface, and hence the photosphere\nprovides for regions of fluid motion along the surface. This allows for regions of convergence, divergence, and\nvorticity motions. A solution may be found through understanding the Sun\xe2\x80\x99s dynamo as a \xe2\x80\x9csurface flow\nphenomenon,\xe2\x80\x9d similar to the original Babcock and Leighton viewpoints. Field magnification could occur through\nsurface processes.\n\nOctober, 1996 Coronal Hole Drawing,\nKaren Harvey, using Kitt Peak He 10830 line\n\nApril - Aug 2005 STAR SOHO/MDI Coronal Hole Maps\n\nApril, May, 2005 STAR SOHO/MDI Coronal Hole Map\n\n2007 STAR SOHO/MDI Coronal Hole Maps\n\nFigure 8.

We propose\nthat the ephemeral active regions are superficial surface features that grow into larger pores and sunspots, that are\nwell observed, simply due to their convergence. This convergence owes to the dynamics associated with fluid\nmotions in the Sun\xe2\x80\x99s upper convection zone that would make \xe2\x80\x9clike\xe2\x80\x9d magnetic fields stick rather than repel, as is\ncustomary in a vacuum. We refer to this process as \xe2\x80\x9cpercolation,\xe2\x80\x9d from the latin noun of action, percolare "to strain\nthrough, filter," from per- "through" + colare "to strain." We believe the small ephemeral regions and pores are\nfiltered or strained through their motions on the solar surface and thus combine into larger scale entities, forming the\nactive regions, of which sunspots are the most familiar form, and unipolar magnetic regions, of which the Sun\xe2\x80\x99s\n\n11\n\npolar fields are the most obvious example. This suggestion places the origin of the Sun\xe2\x80\x99s dynamo field near the\nphotosphere rather than near the base of the Sun\xe2\x80\x99s convection zone as most previous dynamo models employ. The\nphotospheric fields may thus simply arise from an accumulation of existing surface fields, which result in the\n\xe2\x80\x9cmagnetic carpet\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cephemeral regions\xe2\x80\x9d associated with turbulence, rather than from an erupting flux loop. The\ngathering together of the small photospheric fluxes in ephemeral regions into larger size pores and sunspots would\nbe aided by the surface fields that Babcock pictures. This would allow sunspot fields to be oriented in accord with\nHale\xe2\x80\x99s laws of sunspot polarities. More work will be needed to develop these ideas; however, some early\nunderstandings are available (ref. 12).\nLest one think that these ideas are totally original or unique, the location of the solar dynamo was originally\nenvisaged as being very shallow by Babcock (ref. 5). Leighton (ref. 6) explored both shallow and deep dynamos.\nSince their path-breaking analyses, the solar dynamo has predominantly been viewed as deep, owing to there being\ndifficulties in understanding a shallow process in the presence of highly convective overturning. Nevertheless, we\nhave considered rejuvenating this picture in the presence of \xe2\x80\x9cpercolation\xe2\x80\x9d, a process we define wherein \xe2\x80\x9clike\xe2\x80\x9d (same\nsign) solar magnetic fields stick to each other due to their existence in the superadiabatic environment of the upper\nconvection zone. Figure 9 shows a numerical simulation wherein random bits stick into larger entities.\n\nPercolation Model\n\nFigure 9. (Left) A cellular automaton model involving many small positive and negative fields with an overall 10%\nfilling factor. (Right) An enhancement of a smaller area showing the growth for a longer duration. Smaller fields\neventually combine to form larger entities.\nTo achieve field \xe2\x80\x9cstickiness\xe2\x80\x9d, the percolation properties we desire for field entities in the photosphere, we use\ncellular automata with the following properties. The cells exist in a rectangular grid, with toroidal geometry to\nremove edge effects, by having the left and right edges as well as the top and bottom edges connected. Cells have\nthree states, inward (-), outward (+), and neutral (0). These states are randomly initiated for each cell and do not\nchange. Instead, the cells are allowed to move during each \xe2\x80\x9ctime interval,\xe2\x80\x9d until the simulation ends. For each time\ninterval, a number of cell movements may occur through positional cell swapping. When a cell is considered for\nswapping, the number of same states, in the immediate neighborhood is calculated. If a cell has all the same sign\n\n12\n\nneighbors, then the cell is internally situated within a pore or spot, and its position is not changed. Otherwise a cell\nswap may occur based upon probabilities for improved placement. The cells are thus able to generally increase the\nnumber of neighbors of same sign cells, resulting in the emergence of clusters of cells in the same state. This\nessentially provides for an effective clustering, or percolation. Future changes in this methodology may include\ninitiation of field with small dipoles, large scale field interactions with the cells, fluid motions such as differential\nrotation, and possibly more complex models such as enhanced flows associated with the field geometry and\nevolution.\nIn Figure 9 (left side \xe2\x80\x93 upper left), a set of ~250,000 cells is chosen in an initial state of 25,000 random bits (of\n+,-1). This is a 10% filling factor. The zero values are black, the bright values represent + values, and gray areas,\nnegative values. Left side, upper right displays the result after 3 steps; lower left, after 7 steps, and lower right, after\n30 steps. Notice that the same percentage (~10%) is filled in each figure, however, the field regions are becoming\nclustered, due to the percolation or clustering effect. To illustrate the effect of further steps and also examine things\non a smaller scale, we see the illustrations on the right side. A smaller scale size, with longer computational steps\nallows the computer calculations to be performed in reasonable times. Again, upper left is a beginning state. We\nnow choose jumps of 25, 200, and 1000 steps; lower left, after 200 steps, and lower right, after 1000 steps. After\n1000 steps, the entire field is in an almost entirely clustered state. Very little happens near the end; the computations\nonly remove two regions, in the last 800 steps.\nOne other point deserving comment illustrates a lack of agreement between these simulations and observed\nsolar behavior. That is the following. The Sun\xe2\x80\x99s magnetic fields not only have a particular individual distribution\n(small regions of high field strength and large regions of near zero strength), but a large degree of spatial correlation,\nor spatial coherence. The former relates to filling factor and this we purposely overestimated for illustrative\npurposes. The latter relates to how the fields are distributed into active regions, which generally have fields of both\nsigns (bipolar magnetic regions), thus the presence of a large positive (sunspot) field is often correlated spatially\nwith negative fields (opposite sign sunspots) nearby. Our simulations do not show this. We suppose that our\nsimulations are missing something, but our mechanism (of field percolation) could also be incorrect, and the\nupwelling of flux loops adequately explains this well-known fact of solar behavior. Our percolation model is highly\nsimplified; it starts with random unipolar fields. Thus there are two independent distributions of unipolar fields\nwhich evolve independently, except they cannot both occupy the same space, rather than starting as close bipolar\npairs as ephemeral regions do, owing to Maxwell\xe2\x80\x99s divergence B equation. Thus our model is simplified, compared\nwith the Sun, by not having highly correlated small bipoles (EPRs), and other aspects that treat percolation in a\nsimplified fashion, rather than how real flows on the Sun could draw actual field structures together.\nSUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS\nThis paper outlines the polar field precursor method for solar activity forecasting. The polar field observations\nsuggest a peak (smoothed) activity level for solar cycle #24 of about 130 \xc2\xb1 30 (2 \xcf\x83) for F10.7 Radio Flux and 80 \xc2\xb1\n30 (2 \xcf\x83) for sunspot number. Support for reduced polar fields is found from the apparent reduced size of coronal\nholes. Nevertheless, we note that coronal hole data must be further examined as observing techniques have changed\nover long timescales. In addition to an apparent reduction in their apparent size, their behavior appears to be quite\ndifferent in morphology. There have been many examples of these fields drifting at low latitudes during the late\nphase of cycle #23. This is quite unusual. Normally they are at the poles during the late phases. This suggests that\nmuch of the Sun\xe2\x80\x99s polar fields have \xe2\x80\x9cdisappeared\xe2\x80\x9d by reconnection at low latitudes, where they can then escape into\nthe solar wind. As a consequence, cycle #24 may not have a \xe2\x80\x9cfull load\xe2\x80\x9d of explosive magnetic field to rearm itself\nwith. We are in awe of being able to see an object the size of the Sun undergoing as dramatic a change as this in a\nfew short years. Since the Kelvin-Helmholtz timescale for the Sun is about 20 million years, people have naively\ntaken the Sun to be constant. Modern observations show dramatic changes in very short timescales belying steadystate theories. The weather on the Sun is at least as fickle as the weather on the Earth. Concomitant effects of low\nsolar activity upon satellites in LEO will need to be considered by NASA, such as enhancements in orbital debris.\nShallow dynamo models of Babcock and Leighton have often been utilized with a deep origin for the Sun\xe2\x80\x99s dynamo\nfields. This places source of the field near or below the base of the Sun\xe2\x80\x99s convection zone. In contrast, we suggest\nthat magnetic fields in the photosphere may simply arise from an accumulation of existing surface fields rather than\nfrom an erupting flux loop. The gathering together of the small photospheric fluxes in ephemeral regions into larger\nsize pores and sunspots would be aided by the surface fields that Babcock pictures. This would allow sunspot fields\n\n13\n\nto be oriented in accord with Hale\xe2\x80\x99s laws of sunspot polarities (ref. 9). A percolation process with a cellular\nautomaton model appears to be able to mimic some solar features. More work in this area is planned.\n\nREFERENCES\n1.\n\nJoselyn, J.A., J.B. Anderson, H.
