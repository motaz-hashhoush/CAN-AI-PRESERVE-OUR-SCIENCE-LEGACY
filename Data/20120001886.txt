b'Custom Machines Advance Composite Manufacturing\nNASA Technology\n\nmaterial, such as carbon fiber, already pre-impregnated\nwith the bonding resin\xe2\x80\x94in a mold, either by an\nautomated process or, often, by hand. The mold is then\nplaced in an autoclave, a pressurized oven, to cure. Large\ncomposite structures like parts of rockets, airplane wings,\nand wind turbine blades require massive, extremely\nexpensive autoclaves for curing.\nTo help develop less costly, out-of-autoclave composite manufacturing techniques, Langley partnered with\nAccudyne Systems Inc., of Newark, Delaware, through\nthe Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program.\nThrough this partnership, Accudyne applied its expertise\nin creating custom automation equipment for composite\nmanufacturing to develop an automated thermoplastic\ntape laydown head. Unlike a thermoset composite, which\nonce cured cannot be reshaped or reprocessed, a thermoplastic can be reheated for remolding or to heal flaws in its\nstructure. The Accudyne device deposits preheated strips\nof the thermoplastic materials, welding the strips together\nthrough heat and pressure to build up structures layer by\nlayer\xe2\x80\x94eliminating the need for an autoclave.\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s been a dual effort between Langley and Accudyne,\nwhere Langley is trying to develop the thermoplastics that\nwork well, and Accudyne has been fine-tuning the heated\nhead to make this process happen in a reasonable time\nand yield a high-quality part,\xe2\x80\x9d Jensen says.\n\nH\n\nere is a brief list of materials that NASA will\nnot be using to construct spacecraft: wood,\nadobe, fiberglass, bone. While it might be\nobvious why these materials would not make for safe\nspace travel, they do share a common characteristic\nwith materials that may well be the future foundation\nof spacecraft design: They all are composites. Formed\nof two or more unlike materials\xe2\x80\x94such as cellulose and\nlignin in the case of wood, or glass fibers and plastic\nresin in the case of fiberglass\xe2\x80\x94composites provide\nenhanced mechanical and physical properties through\nthe combination of their constituent materials. For this\nreason, composites are used in everything from buildings, bathtubs, and countertops to boats, racecars, and\nsports equipment.\nNASA continually works to develop new materials to\nenable future space missions\xe2\x80\x94lighter, less expensive materials that can still withstand the extreme demands of space\ntravel. Composites such as carbon fiber materials offer\npromising solutions in this regard, providing strength and\nstiffness comparable to metals like aluminum but with less\nweight, allowing for benefits like better fuel efficiency and\nsimpler propulsion system design. Composites can also\nbe made fatigue tolerant and thermally stable\xe2\x80\x94useful in\nspace where temperatures can swing hundreds of degrees.\nNASA has recently explored the use of composites\nfor aerospace applications through projects like the\nComposite Crew Module (CCM), a composite-constructed version of the aluminum-lithium Multipurpose\nCrew Capsule. The CCM was designed to give NASA\nengineers a chance to gain valuable experience developing\nand testing composite aerospace structures.\n\nPartnership\nComposites are an increasingly significant part\nof terrestrial applications, from transportation (the\nlargely plastic composite airframe of the new Boeing\n150\t Industrial Productivity\t\n\nBenefits\nThe Composite Crew Module allows NASA researchers to test\nmaterials and methods that may one day be applied to spacecraft constructed using composite materials.\n\n787 Dreamliner, for example) to medicine (composite\nprostheses among other uses). As the composites industry\nhas matured, says Brian Jensen, materials scientist at\nLangley Research Center, NASA \xe2\x80\x9cstarted an effort to not\nonly improve the performance of composites, but also to\nlower the cost.\xe2\x80\x9d Cost is a major challenge to composite\nmanufacturing. Composites are traditionally fabricated\nby layering prepreg materials\xe2\x80\x94sheets of reinforcement\n\nWhile the tape laydown head currently features as part\nof an Accudyne-built machine at Langley, the company\xe2\x80\x99s\nSBIR work has yielded technology for its commercial\nproducts, as well. Autoclave-cured thermoset materials\nstill dominate composites manufacturing, explains John\nMelilli, Accudyne\xe2\x80\x99s vice president of sales and marketing,\nand the company\xe2\x80\x99s commercially available deposition\nheads for thermoset systems employ technology created\nfor the SBIR-developed laydown head. Through another\nNASA SBIR, Accudyne also developed nanoparticle technology that, when mixed with a composite resin, helps\nSpinoff 2011\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cNASA\xe2\x80\x99s support of manufacturing is\nimportant to maintaining and advancing the\nNation\xe2\x80\x99s technological capabilities.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x94\n\xc2\xad John Melilli, Accudyne Systems Inc.\n\nSpinoff 2011\t\n\nThe automated thermoplastic tape laydown head developed by Accudyne Systems Inc. provides Langley Research Center engineers\nand others with a unique tool for advancing out-of-autoclave thermoplastics manufacturing.\n\nThis learning process is still very much underway at\nLangley, where the Accudyne-built machine is available\nfor researchers and partners in private industry to use.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThat machine is going to be indispensable in helping\nto develop a database of processes and parts made from\nthermoplastics,\xe2\x80\x9d Melilli says. In the meantime, Accudyne\nis currently engaged in a Small Business Technology\nTransfer (STTR) project with Langley and the University\n\nof Delaware to improve the properties of parts made with\nthe SBIR-derived tape laydown head.\nThe results indicate a bright future for out-of-autoclave\nthermoplastics manufacturing. Jensen notes that these\nparts initially exhibited performance properties 70\xe2\x80\x9380\npercent of those made using an autoclave. Through the\nSTTR partnership, those results are now around 90\xe2\x80\x9395\npercent. v\nIndustrial Productivity\t 151\n\nIndustrial\nProductivity\n\nthe material develop improved properties\xe2\x80\x94allowing\nhigh-quality parts to be made more quickly at lower cost,\nMelilli says. The company has patented the innovation\nand expects significant commercial interest.\nAccudyne is currently working with major aerospace\ncompanies to develop machines for manufacturing\ncomposite rocket parts and components for helicopter\nrotors. The company\xe2\x80\x99s automated solutions enable the\nproduction of higher quality parts at lower costs, while\nnot threatening the jobs of the workers who previously\nfabricated the composite parts by hand.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is not about replacing people with machines,\xe2\x80\x9d\nMelilli says. \xe2\x80\x9cThe people end up working with the\nmachines, and the rate of production goes up.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe kind of support that NASA has provided to\ncomposite manufacturing innovators like Accudyne has\nbeen essential to the continued development of the entire\nindustry, Melilli notes. \xe2\x80\x9cThe reality is that the work,\nconnections, and references that NASA has continued\nto provide have been crucial to keeping this technology\ngoing.\xe2\x80\x9d\nIn a broader sense, he says, \xe2\x80\x9cNASA\xe2\x80\x99s support of\nmanufacturing in general is important to maintaining\nand advancing the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s technological capabilities.\nManufacturing is so important because you end up applying all of the process lessons you have learned over time.\nThe United States runs the risk of falling behind in developing new processes and manufacturing technologies if, as\nis the current trend, manufacturing continues to migrate\nto foreign countries.
