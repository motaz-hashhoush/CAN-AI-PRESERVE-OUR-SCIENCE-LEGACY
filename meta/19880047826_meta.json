Evolution takes several forms, ranging from simple growth through addition of infrastructure elements to upgrading of system capability through inclusion of advanced technologies. Much of the early considerations of Space Station evolution focused on physical growth. However, a series of recent workshops have revealed that the more likely mode of Space Station evolution will not be through growth but rather through a process known as 'branching'.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 19880047826, "endDate": "1986-10-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "AAS"}}, "meetingId": "ba4e35418dab4b0a90daad9f6766743d", "id": "e48c84dfa2f840c9afb6e234e9d3a0dd"}], "name": "Aerospace century XXI: Space missions and policy", "location": "Boulder, CO", "id": "ba4e35418dab4b0a90daad9f6766743d", "startDate": "1986-10-26T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 19880047826, "id": "30967be64b6d4ab3a894125e828d31a8", "publicationDate": "1987-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
