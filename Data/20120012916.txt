There arc mainly two types oflidars depending on the types of\nmeas urements. lidars that arc designed to meas ure the distance and properties of hard targets are often called laser\nrangers or laser altimeters. They arc used to obtain the surface elevation and global shape o fa planet from the laser\npu lse time-of- n ight and the spacecraft orbit position. lidars that arc designed to measure the b3ckscatlering and\nabsorption of a volume scatter, such as clouds and 3erosol , arc oft en just ca lled lidars and categorized by their\nmeas urements. such as cloud and aerosollid3r, wind lidar, C02 lidar, and so on. The 3dvantages of space-based\nlidar system s over ground based lidars are the abilities of global coverage and continuous measurements.\n2. Early Space-Based l ase r Altim eters\nThe fi rst space-based lidar instrument was a laser ra nger developed by the Un ited States 011 the Apollo 15 miss ion in\n197 1 using a nash lump pumped rub y laser 3t3 .75 pulses per minute. The Apollo 15, 16, and 17 missions combined,\nmade a few thousand measurements of the lunar s urface around the equator. With the advent of diode pumped lasers\nin the late 1980s, the lifet ime, efficiency, resolution and the mass o f lasers and space lidar all improved dramatically.\nThe first space-based lidar that used a diode pumped Nd:Y AG laser was the Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOlA)\ndeveloped at the National Aeronautic and Sp3ce Administration (NASA) Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) on\nthe Mars Observer mi ssion in 1992. Unfortunately. the spacecraft developed a problem and d id not reach the Mars\norbit. A smaller laser ranger with similar laser and detector de veloped by the Naval Research lab new on the\nClementine m ission \\0 the Moon in 1994 and provided a global topographic map o f the entire lunar surface at a few\nhundred-meter precisions. A small laser ranger devcloped by the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics\nlaboratory on board the Near Eanh Asteroid Rendezvous (NEAR) miss ion, launched in 1994, successfully\nmeas ured the topography and shape of the ncar Earth asteroid 433 Eros.\nA second MOlA was buHt by NASA GSFC and launched in 1997 on board Mars G lobal Surveyor (MGS).\nMOlA was both a laser ranger and a laser radiometer. It measured not only the laser pulse time-o f-night but also the\npul se width and energy, which were 10 correct the range walk caused by the signal amplitude va riation, to infer the\nsurface slope from the laser pulse broadening. and 10 estimate the surface reflectance to the laser light. MOlt\\ 011board science algorithm tracked the ground surface re turns and dynamically adjusted the receiver detection\nthresho ld and range gate to keep the instrument at the highest receiver sensitivity. Mal A made 650 million Mars\nsurface topographic measurements over one full Martian year (two Earth years) at about 0.25 m eter precision. The\noverall meas urement 3ccuracy was limited by the s pacecraft orbit position and laser footprint location detennination,\nwhich was about I meter in radial direction and a few hundred meters cross track. The MOl A detector noise, which\nwas a function of the solar background light in the rece iver fi eld of view, was also used to produce a passive\nradiometry map of Mars at 1064: I nm wavelength.\n3. Lidar Experim en ts on the Spa ce Sh un les\nTwo s pace based lidar systems were nown on the Space Transportmion System s (STS), or Space Shuttles, as\ntcchnology path finders. Lidar In-space Techno logy Ex periment (LITE) developed by NASA \'s langley Rescarch\nCcnter (laRC) was launched in 1994 aboard ST S-64. LITE was an atmosphere backscaHering lidar using diodepumped Q-switched Nd:YAG laser at 1064,532. and 355 nm wavelength and provided valua ble data on the\nbackscattering properties of clouds and aerosols as well as surface returns. The Shutt le Laser A ltimeter (SlA)\ndevelo ped by NASA GSFC fl ew on STS-72 in 1996 and STS-85 in 1997 along with several other science payload\n\ninstruments. SLA demonstmted laser surface elcvation measurements through Earth\'s atmosphere and the usc of\nlaser altimeter to study vegetation covemge.\n4. Ea rlh Orbiting lida rs\nTwo earth orbi ting lidars followed the lidar experiments on the Space Shuttle. The first was the Geoscience Laser\nAltimeter System (GLAS) on the Icc, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite (ICESat) developed at NASA GSFC and\nlaunched in Jll1lUary 2003. GLAS had one surface altimetry channel at 1064 nm wavelength and two cloud and\naerosol backseatlering profile channels at 1064 nm and 532 nm. respect ively. lCESat completed its science mi ssion\nin 2009 with about 2 bi ll ion laser shot measurements at2to 3 cm range precision. ICESalfGLA S provided\nunprecedented data set of icc sheets in Antarctica and Greenland. sea icc in the Arctic, land and vegetation in midlatitude, and atmosphere back scatlering profilcs across the globe.\nThe Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) satellite developed by\nNASA LaRC and Ball Aerospace & Technology Corporation was launched June 2006. CA LIPSO lidar measures the\natmosphere backscattering profiles at 532 nm and 1064 nm in concert with seven other Earth observing satellites in\nthe "A-Train:\'.CA LI PSO lidar has accumu lated more than 2 billion laser pu lse measurements and provided new\ninsight into the roles that clouds and atmospheric aerosols play in regUlating Earth\'s climate.\n5. Rece nt Pla nN a ry a nd L.un a r Laser A.itimeters\nThe Mercury Laser Altimeter (MLA) developed at NASA GSFC on board the MErcury Surface. Space\nENvironment, GEochemistry, ::md Ranging (MESSENGER) missions was launched in August 2004 and entered\nMercury \'s orbit in March 2011. MLA was a miniaturized MOLA but for a much harsher thennal environment . MLA\nhad to make range measurement from a highly elliptical spacecraft orbit around the planet and a laser beam-pointing\nangle always perpendicular to the sun light due to the spacecraft thennal constraints. As a result, MLA often\noperates in off nadir direction and over great distances. Despite the harsh thennal environment and unfavorable\nmeasurement conditions, M LA has made topographic measurements of Mercury northern hemisphere and continues\nto operate to this date.\nA smaill idar developed by NEC and TOSHIBA was on board the Hayabusa mission of Japan, which was\nlaunched in 2003, successfully ranged to asteroid ltokawa after orbit insertion in 2005. A sma ll atmosphere\nbackscattering lidar developed in Canada on board the Phoenix Mars Lander was launched in 2007 and successfully\nmeasured the Mars atmosphere backscattering profiles until the mission completed in 2008.\nSeveral laser altimeters have flown around the lunar orbit in recent years. The laser altimeter (LAL T)\ndeveloped by NEC Corporation on board Ihe Japanese lunar explorer Selenological and Engineering Explorer\n(SELENE or Kaguya) was launched in September 2007. LAL T made 13 million topographic measurements of the\nmoon at about 5 meter precision and accuracy. The laser altimeter developed by China on board the Chang\'E-l\nspacecraft launched in October 2007 made aboutS mi llion topographic measurements of the llloon. The Lunar Laser\nRanging Instrument (L LRI) on board the Chandrayaan spacecraft developed by India was launched in October 2008\nand made several million lunar topographic measurements.\nThe Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter (LOLA), developed at NASA GSFC. was launched June 2009 on board\nthe Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) and continues to operate to dale. LOLA is the first multi-beam laser\naltimeter in space. A difTractive optical element (DOE) was mounted on top of the laser beam expander that splits\nthe laser beam into fi ve beams. There arc five independent receiver channels, each looking at one laser spot on\nground. As a result , it gives not on ly the surface elevat ion, but also the slope and directions from a single laser shot.\nLOLA also provided the surface reflectance measurements and \xc2\xb7\'sees" inside the pennanentiy shadowed craters in\npolar regions of the moon. To date, LOLA has made about 5 billion lunar topographic measurements.\n6. Space Based Lidar C ur rently Under Developme nt\nThere arc several space-based lidar systems current ly being built, including the ADM-Aeolus wind tidar for Earth by\nthe European Space Agency (ESA) scheduled to launch in 2013; the Bepi-Colombo Laser Altimeter (BELA) on the\nBepi-Co lombo mission by ESA to be launched in 2014; and the Advanced Topographic Laser Altimeter System\n(ATLAS) on the ICESat-2 mission by NASA GSFC to be launched in 20 16. Several advanced space based lidar\nsystems arc also being planned for ncar future. including severallidar systems for the International Space Station\n(ISS), thc C01lidar for NASA\'s Active Sensing of COl Emission over Nights. Days. and Seasons (ASCENDS)\nmission, and the laser altimeter for the Jupiter icy moon mission by ESA to be launched later in this decade.\n\n'
