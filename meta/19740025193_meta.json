In accordance with the low-cost Pioneer Venus concept, NASA intends to use the same basic spacecraft, known as the bus, for the execution of the two missions. The bus will be equipped with all of the subsystems common to the probe and orbiter missions (for example, thermal control, solar cells and power supply, attitude measurement and control, telemetry and communication electronics, and auxiliary propulsion unit). For the 1977 mission, the bus will be equipped with the large and small probes and a special antenna system. For the orbiter mission, the bus will be equipped with a retro-propulsion motor and a high-gain antenna. A diagram of the system envisaged is shown.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19740025193, "id": "c6f4a70a23d646eb8d20ef732aad7347", "publicationDate": "1974-08-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19740025193.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19740025193/downloads/19740025193.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19740025193/downloads/19740025193.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19740025193/downloads/19740025193.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
