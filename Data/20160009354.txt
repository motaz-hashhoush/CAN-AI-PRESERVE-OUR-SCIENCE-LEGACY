b'Symposium Title: Spectroscopy in the Planetary Sciences (16AWD02)\nMartian Surface Mineralogy from Rovers with Spirit, Opportunity, and Curiosity.\nRichard V. Morris, NASA Johnson Space Center (richard.v.morris@nasa.gov)\nBeginning in 2004, NASA has landed three well-instrumented rovers on the equatorial martian\nsurface. The Spirit rover landed in Gusev crater in early January, 2004, and the Opportunity\nrover landed on the opposite side of Mars at Meridian Planum 21 days later. The Curiosity rover\nlanded in Gale crater to the west of Gusev crater in August, 2012. Both Opportunity and\nCuriosity are currently operational. The twin rovers Spirit and Opportunity carried Mossbauer\nspectrometers to determine the oxidation state of iron and its mineralogical composition. The\nCuriosity rover has an X-ray diffraction instrument for identification and quantification of\ncrystalline materials including clay minerals. Instrument suites on all three rovers are capable of\ndistinguishing primary rock-forming minerals like olivine, pyroxene and magnetite and products\nof aqueous alteration in including amorphous iron oxides, hematite, goethite, sulfates, and clay\nminerals. The oxidation state of iron ranges from that typical for unweathered rocks and soils to\nnearly completely oxidized (weathered) rocks and soils as products of aqueous and acid-sulfate\nalteration. The in situ rover mineralogy also serves as ground-truth for orbital observations, and\norbital mineralogical inferences are used for evaluating and planning rover exploration.\n\n'
