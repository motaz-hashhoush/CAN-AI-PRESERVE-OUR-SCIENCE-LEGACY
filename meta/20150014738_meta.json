Once emergency is detected, spacecraft is put into a safe mode, i.e., antenna to be used for emergency mode communications is pointed towards the sun and use total available power to transmit. There are many parameters affecting communications in this mode and these should be properly balanced to produce desired results. This paper explores the effectiveness of spacecraft antenna gain pattern in the emergency mode with respect to positions of the spacecraft, earth, Sun Earth Probe (SEP) angle at the receiving antenna, and the range of the spacecraft with respect to the ground station. The paper also provides parabolic reflector antenna diameter that should be used for emergency mode as a function of the satellite to sun range in the solar system.", "title": "Deep Space Mission Emergency Mode Downlink", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2015-08-03T07:41:49.5370000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20150014738, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Kantak, Anil V."}, "organization": {"name": "Jet Propulsion Lab., California Inst. of Tech.", "location": "Pasadena, CA, United States"}}, "id": "cc73c11e16c44f9b9b796844d608acf8"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20150014738, "endDate": "2008-06-12T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Inst. of Aeronautics and Astronautics", "location": "Reston, VA, United States"}}, "meetingId": "3c9c4beab9bf4059a4f20d0b5fe60c24", "id": "51b0f3ed0ae444db9488dd1fc3e6f153"}], "name": "International Communications Satellite Systems Conference", "location": "San Diego, CA", "id": "3c9c4beab9bf4059a4f20d0b5fe60c24", "startDate": "2008-06-10T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "id": 20150014738, "sourceIdentifiers": [{"number": "hdl:2014/45369", "type": "HANDLE"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20150014738, "id": "12a31d9dcdf7471ab573e8993381012e", "publicationDate": "2008-06-10T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
