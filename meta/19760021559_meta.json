This approach is applicable to both publicly- and privately-owned utilities. Busbar cost represents the minimum price per unit of energy consistent with producing system-resultant revenues equal to the sum of system-resultant costs. This equality is expressed in present value terms, where the discount rate used reflects the rate of return required on invested capital. Major input variables describe the output capabilities and capital cost of the energy system, the cash flows required for system operation amd maintenance, and the financial structure and tax environment of the utility.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19760021559, "id": "26cfb65aa0914661831affbf21249d28", "publicationDate": "1976-06-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19760021559.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19760021559/downloads/19760021559.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19760021559/downloads/19760021559.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19760021559/downloads/19760021559.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
