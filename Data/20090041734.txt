b"Vision for Space Exploration\nComplete the International Space Station\nSafely fly the Space Shuttle until 2010\nDevelop and fly the Crew Exploration Vehicle (by 2015)\nReturn to the moon (by 2020)\nSustained and affordable human and robotic program\nDevelop innovative technologies, knowledge, and infrastructures\nPromote international and commercial participation\n\nNASA/CP\xe2\x80\x942009-215677\n\nNASA is building a new spacecraft that will become America's primary vehicle for human\nspace exploration in the next decade. The new spacecraft, Orion, is part of the Constellation\nProgram to send explorers to the moon and onward to other destinations in the solar system.\n\nNASA/CP\xe2\x80\x942009-215677\t\n\n2\n\nNASA has established 6 Themes for Exploration\nUSE THE MOON: Reduce risks and cost and increase productivity of future\nmissions by testing technologies, systems, and operations in a planetary\nenvironment other than the Earth\nPURSUE SCIENTIFIC: Engage in scientific investigations of the Moon (solar\nsystem processes), on the Moon (use the unique environment), and from the Moon\n(to study other celestial phenomena)\nEXTEND PERMANENT HUMAN PRESENCE: Develop the capabilities and\ninfrastructure required to expand the number of people, the duration, the selfsufficiency, and the degree of non-governmental activity\nEXPAND EARTH\xe2\x80\x99S ECONOMIC SPHERE: Create new markets based on lunar\nactivity that will return economic, technological, and quality-of-life benefits\nENHANCE GLOBAL SECURTIY: Provide a challenging, shared, and peaceful\nglobal vision that unites nations in pursuit of common objectives\nENGAGE, INSPIRE: Excite the public about space, encourage students to pursue\ncareers in high technology fields, ensure that individuals enter the workforce with\nthe scientific and technical knowledge necessary to sustain exploration\n\nNASA/CP\xe2\x80\x942009-215677\n\nThe Orion crew exploration vehicle will be launched into Earth orbit by the Ares I crew\nlaunch vehicle. Orion and its launch abort system will be placed at the top of the Ares I\nrocket to eliminate the threat to the crew from falling debris on launch and ascent.\nFor missions to the moon, Orion will dock in low Earth orbit with a lunar lander module,\nAltair, and an Earth departure stage. The Earth departure stage will propel Orion and Altair\nto the moon.\nOnce they have reached lunar orbit, astronauts will use the landing craft to travel to the\n\xe2\x80\x99\nmoons surface.\nOrion will stay in lunar orbit waiting for the crew to return in a part of the lander called the\nascent module. When all the astronauts are back inside Orion, the spacecraft will break out\nof the lunar orbit and head home to Earth, propelled by the main engine of its service\nmodule.\n\nNASA/CP\xe2\x80\x942009-215677\t\n\n4\n\nTo make these new launch systems safer and simpler, NASA is using proven\ntechnologies from the Apollo Saturn V and the Space Shuttle programs. Common\npropulsion elements between the two systems will reduce operations costs to\npromote the long-term investigation of Earth\xe2\x80\x99s cosmic neighborhood and worlds\nbeyond.\nThe Ares I includes a first stage evolved from the Shuttle\xe2\x80\x99s reusable solid rocket\nbooster and an upper stage powered by a J-2X engine, with heritage from the Saturn\nV. The Ares I will carry the Orion crew exploration vehicle to Earth orbit.\nThe Ares V propulsion includes two reusable solid rocket boosters, much like the\nbooster used in the Ares I\xe2\x80\x99s first stage. It also uses five commercial RS\xe2\x80\x9368 engines\nfueled by a 33-foot-diameter tank, close in size to the Saturn V. The Earth departure\nstage, which transports the lunar lander and Orion toward the Moon, is powered by\na J-2X engine, the same as that used for the Ares I\xe2\x80\x99s upper stage.\n\nNASA/CP\xe2\x80\x942009-215677\n\nInformation based on a September 25, 2008, industry briefing.\nThe first crewed flight of the Orion spacecraft aboard an Ares I rocket is scheduled for no\nlater than 2015, when it will fly to the International Space Station. Altair's first landing on\nthe moon with an astronaut crew is planned for no later than 2020.\n\nNASA/CP\xe2\x80\x942009-215677\t\n\n6\n\nNASA has engaged its workforce to enable the safe and reliable transport of humans\nto the International Space Station, moon and Mars.\nThe International Space Station (ISS) is the largest and most complicated spacecraft\never built. It is allowing NASA to conduct scientific research to improve life on\nEarth and to prepare for long-duration space flights to the moon and other\ndestinations.\n\nNASA/CP\xe2\x80\x942009-215677\t\n\n7\n\nThe main components are:\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n5.\n\nThe launch abort system\nThe crew exploration vehicle (Orion)\nThe service module\nThe jettison panels\nThe spacecraft adapter\n\nNASA/CP\xe2\x80\x942009-215677\n\nKEY POINTS:\nConstellation Program work is distributed across the country.\nThis chart shows areas of responsibility at the 10 NASA centers.\nContractors have facilities at many other locations that also support\nConstellation.\n\nNASA/CP\xe2\x80\x942009-215677\t\n\n9\n\nOrion will be similar in shape to the Apollo spacecraft, but larger, with 2\xe2\x80\x931/2 times\nthe volume of the Apollo capsule.\n\nNASA/CP\xe2\x80\x942009-215677\t\n\n10\n\nCrew Module couch area exposed\nDiameter \xe2\x80\x9316.5 ft.

Recent tests\nvalidated the UltraFlex array's acceleration capability, up to 2.7g, required for\nOrion's lunar missions. Smaller-scale arrays are powering NASA's Phoenix Lander\nthat is on Mars.\n\nNASA/CP\xe2\x80\x942009-215677\t\n\n12\n\nThe NASA Glenn Research Center operates the Plum Brook Station\xe2\x80\x94a vast\ncomplex over 10 square miles near Sandusky, Ohio. Plum Brook Station is home of\nthe SPF which houses the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest space environment simulation chamber.\nThe chamber's wide-ranging capabilities have been extensively used to test launch\nvehicle payload fairings, orbital hardware including International Space Station\nsystems, and planetary landing systems like the Mars Pathfinder and the Mars\nExploration Rovers' airbag systems. SPF will serve as the primary location for\nIntegrated Environmental Testing (IET) of the Orion Crew Exploration Vehicle\n(CEV) Ground Test Article and Qualification vehicle. SPF's unique capabilities will\npermit complete environmental testing of the Orion CEV in a single facility at a\nsingle location.\nThis \xe2\x80\x9cone-stop shopping\xe2\x80\x9d capability reduces project risk by eliminating the need to\nship the vehicle to different locations to complete the gamut of testing required for\ndesign and production necessary for human space flight.

The Earth departure stage will propel Orion and\nthe module to the moon. Once they have reached the moon\xe2\x80\x99s orbit, astronauts will\nuse the lunar landing craft to travel to the moon\xe2\x80\x99s surface. Orion will stay in the\nlunar orbit awaiting return of the crew. The astronauts will return to the orbiting\nOrion using a lunar surface ascent module. When the crew has reunited with the\nOrion spacecraft, the service module main engine will provide the power that Orion\nneeds to break out of the lunar orbit and return to Earth.\n\nNASA/CP\xe2\x80\x942009-215677\t\n\n16\n\nDescent module\nPropulsion for LOI and powered descent\nPower during lunar transit, descent, and surface ops\nPlatform for lunar landing/liftoff of ascent module\nAscent module\nPropulsion for ascent from lunar surface\nHabitable volume for four during descent, surface, and ascent operations\nContains cockpit and majority of avionics\nAirlock\nAccommodates 2 astronauts per ingress/egress\nConnected to ascent module via short tunnel\nRemains with descent module on lunar surface\n\nNASA/CP\xe2\x80\x942009-215677\t\n\n17\n\nAltair will be capable of landing four astronauts on the moon, providing life support\nand a base for weeklong initial surface exploration missions, and returning the crew\nto the Orion spacecraft that will bring them home to Earth. Altair will launch aboard\nan Ares V rocket into low Earth orbit, where it will rendezvous with the Orion crew\nvehicle.\n\nNASA/CP\xe2\x80\x942009-215677\t\n\n18\n\nNASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, or LRO, is scheduled to launch April 24\naboard an Atlas V rocket. The orbiter will carry seven instruments to provide\nscientists with detailed maps of the lunar surface and enhance our understanding of\nthe moon's topography, lighting conditions, mineralogical composition and natural\nresources. Information gleaned from LRO will be used to select safe landing sites,\ndetermine locations for future lunar outposts and help to mitigate radiation dangers\nto astronauts.\nNote: Apollo was equatorial and \xe2\x80\x9cfront-side\xe2\x80\x9d only.\n\nNASA/CP\xe2\x80\x942009-215677\t\n\n19\n\nAccompanying the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter will be the Lunar Crater\nObservation and Sensing Satellite, a mission that will impact the moon's surface in\nits search for water ice. Right now the Shackelton Crater at the South Pole, the\nlargest basin in the solar system, is being targeted for possible water. It is also in\nalmost constant sunlight. The Shackelton crater lies entirely within the rim of the\nimmense South Pole\xe2\x80\x93Aitken basin, which is the largest known impact formation in\nthe Solar system.\n\nNASA/CP\xe2\x80\x942009-215677\t\n\n20\n\nRecently, two NASA instruments traveled to the moon to begin a two\xe2\x80\x93year mission\nof mapping the lunar surface. The Moon Mineralogy Mapped will assess mineral\nresources, and the Miniature Synthetic Aperture Radar, or Mini-SAR, will map the\npolar regions and look for ice deposits. Data from the two instruments will\ncontribute to NASA's increased understanding of the lunar environment as it\nimplements the nation's space exploration policy, which calls for robotic and human\nmissions to the moon.\nThe Moon Mineralogy Mapped is a state-of-the-art imaging spectrometer that will\nprovide the first map of the entire lunar surface at high spatial and spectral\nresolution, revealing the minerals that make up the moon's surface. Scientists will\nuse this information to answer questions about the moon's origin and geological\ndevelopment, as well as the evolution of terrestrial planets in the early solar system.\nThe map also may be used by astronauts to locate resources, possibly including\nwater, that can support exploration of the moon and beyond.\nThe Mini-SAR data will be used to determine the location and distribution of water\nice deposits on the moon. Data from the instrument will help scientists learn about\nthe history and nature of objects hitting the moon, and the processes that throw\nmaterial from the outer solar system into the inner planets.\n\nNASA/CP\xe2\x80\x942009-215677\t\n\n21\n\nIt is planned that one day Mars-bound vehicles will be assembled in low-Earth orbit.\nOrion will be the Earth entry vehicle for lunar and Mars returns.\n\nNASA/CP\xe2\x80\x942009-215677\t\n\n22\n\nFor more information go to:\nwww.nasa.gov\n\nNASA/CP\xe2\x80\x942009-215677\t\n\n23\n\n"
