b'Applied Sciences Program Integrated Product Team for Air Quality\n\nAddendum to Air Quality: Decision Support Tools, Partner Plans,\nWorking Groups, Committees\nSection 2.0 Major Federal Agency Air Quality Programs\n2.6 Tennessee Valley Authority\nThe Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) strategic plan for 2004, Tennessee Valley Authority Strategic\nPlan: A Framework for a Competitive Future, includes environmental stewardship as a mission.\nHowever, this mission contains no specific references to air quality. The only references to air quality\nwithin the strategic plan occur in relation to power generation and the need for emissions control due\nto air quality regulations imposed by the Clean Air Act. Because the TVA is a hybrid between a\ngovernment agency and industry, the strategic plan differs from those of Federal agencies by focusing\nmainly on production and debt reduction rather than placing an emphasis on partnerships and\ntechnology development. However, an air quality research program identified within the TVA may\nbenefit from incorporation of NASA data.\n2.6.1 Background\nCongress created the Tennessee Valley Authority in 1933 to enhance the quality of life in the\nTennessee Valley region. This objective has been accomplished by providing flood control and\nmaintaining navigation on the Tennessee River, the fifth largest river system in the country, and by\ngenerating and transmitting electricity in the seven-state Valley region. TVA meets the power needs\nof 8.3 million people in an 80,000-square-mile area via 158 power distributors and directly serves\nlarge-area industries as well. TVA\xe2\x80\x99s electric power system includes 59 coal-fired units at 11 sites,\n3 nuclear plants, 29 hydropower plants, 6 combustion-turbine plants, 3 wind turbines, and 15 solar\ninstallations. Thus, a mix of fossil, nuclear, hydroelectric, and renewable sources aids in the reliability\nof power generation. These systems account for over $7 billion in annual energy sales that pay for all\nTVA activities, including flood control, land management, and environmental research.\nThrough the Clean Air Act, Congress mandated the protection and enhancement of the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s air\nquality resources. National Ambient Air Quality Standards for the following pollutants have been\nestablished to protect the public health and welfare:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nSulfur dioxide (SO2)\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nOzone (O3)\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nNitrogen dioxide (NO2)\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nParticulate matter <10 \xce\xbcm in diameter (PM10) and <2.5 \xce\xbcm (PM2.5) in diameter\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nCarbon monoxide (CO)\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nLead (Pb)\n\nOther regulatory programs affecting emissions include the Acid Rain Control Program and the\nRegional Haze Rule.\n\nAddendum-1\n\nAir Quality: Decision Support Tools, Partner Plans, Working Groups, Committees\n\nFurthermore, the Air Quality Research Subcommittee of the Committee on the Environment and\nNatural Resources has identified in its Strategic Plan five of the most pressing air quality issues\ntoday: 1) particulate matter and visibility, 2) ozone and associated air pollutants, 3) acidic deposition,\n4) hazardous air pollutants, and 5) indoor air quality. Clearly, these issues are interdependent and\nmany of the associated phenomena are interrelated. For example, the same complex chemistry that\nproduces ozone also results in the formation of fine particles and the acids responsible for acidic\ndeposition.\nAir pollutant emissions from TVA plants have been documented to contribute to a degradation of\nregional air quality. Nitrate, sulfate, and ozone are secondary pollutants derived from the burning of\nfossil fuels (coal) at these plants. Once these secondary pollutants are created from the primary\nemissions, they become airborne, affecting human populations, regional visibility, soil/vegetation\nhealth, and water quality. Haze is created as emitted sulfur travels east on prevailing air currents and\nadmixes with the humid air. Haze affects the appearance of mountain views at both high and low\nelevations. Additionally, area ozone produced by the reaction of nitrogen oxides and volatile organic\ncompounds in the presence of sunlight is one of the most widespread pollutants that strongly affects\nnot only vegetation but also public health.\nTVA has moved to comply with Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) concerns for the\nenvironment. TVA has reduced sulfur dioxide emissions by 76 percent since 1977. In addition, TVA\nhas reduced ozone-season emissions of nitrogen oxide by 50 percent in the past 8 years. This\nreduction has occurred despite the fact that since 1990, the population in the TVA service area has\ngrown by more than 15 percent, gross regional product has grown by nearly 50 percent, and demand\nfor electricity has grown by more than 10 percent. To meet these needs, TVA expects to increase its\ncapacity more than 10 percent through 2005. However, most of the increased capacity will be\ngenerated using non-coal burning turbines that operate on natural gas or oil.\n2.6.2 Synopsis of Air Quality Efforts\nThe primary objective of TVA\'s air quality program is focused on issues that are important to the\nTennessee Valley region. Ongoing monitoring and research programs are intended to improve the\nunderstanding of the underlying factors that control the distribution of pollutants in the atmosphere.\nThese programs include laboratory studies, long-term monitoring, intensive field studies, and model\ndevelopment and application. Studies are being conducted on ground-level ozone, acid rain,\nparticulate matter, and other air toxics. These activities are conducted in collaboration with Federal\nagencies, universities, and stakeholder groups. Monitoring and research results are transferred to the\npolicy/regulatory community, where they are employed in the development of effective control\nstrategies.\nTVA has traditionally looked at larger scale air quality assessments but recently has begun to refine\nthe scale of its monitoring and modeling to include smaller spatial scale events. The following is a\nlisting of air quality concerns for TVA:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nRegional haze and visibility\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nOzone\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nFine particulates\n\nAddendum-2\n\nApplied Sciences Program Integrated Product Team for Air Quality\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nChemical and physical composition of pollutants\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nMeteorological conditions\n\nOf particular concern are fine particulates, visibility, and ozone \xe2\x80\x93 which are interlinked in their net\neffects on air quality. Airborne fine particles, especially PM2.5, have been linked to adverse health\neffects and regional haze. Regional visibility is estimated to have declined by as much as 60 percent\nover the past 50 years in the eastern United States. Much regional haze is due to fine sulfate particles.\nSome sulfates can originate from natural sources, but most regional haze is caused by fine,\nanthropogenic sulfate particles. Ozone is also a cause of haze, which, again, limits visibility and can\ninduce health problems in local populations. Exposure to high levels of ozone can harm lung tissue,\nimpair lung function, and sensitize the respiratory system. Recent evidence suggests that elevated\nozone exposure not only affects those with existing health problems, such as asthma or heart disease,\nbut also may be detrimental to healthy people.\nPresently, TVA and its program partners are pursuing monitoring and modeling programs for PM2.5,\nvisibility, and ozone. Most emphasis is placed upon sulfate detection and visibility issues. TVA\nworks with state and local air quality agencies to monitor air quality via in-situ monitoring sites. The\ndata gathered is sent to the EPA and incorporated into a standing database. This database is used in\nvarious ways by the different partner agencies to provide both an ongoing assessment of conditions as\nwell as a baseline for new companies locating within the TVA area. TVA currently operates\n11 air-quality compliance-monitoring stations. Nine stations in Alabama and Tennessee measure\nhourly levels of sulfur dioxide near TVA power plants to demonstrate continuing compliance with\nclean air standards. Two ozone compliance-monitoring stations are located at the TVA Paradise and\nShawnee fossil power plants in Kentucky.\nAccording to TVA representatives, research is being pursued in modeling and field activities. For\nexample, in the Great Smoky National Park area, monitoring is ongoing to determine particulate\ncharacter and size distribution that causes reduced visibility in scenic park areas. The Look Rock\nmonitoring site includes a Web cam for an assessment of the visibility on a given day. Modeling\ninvolves exercising the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) and CALPUFF models for\nrelevant data inputs and geographical areas.\n2.6.3 Projects and Observations\nIn 1992, the Southern Appalachian Mountain Initiative (SAMI) was formed as a public-private\nregional partnership to address air quality concerns in the region. The partnership\'s goal was to\n\xe2\x80\x9cidentify and recommend reasonable measures to remedy existing and prevent future adverse effects\nfrom human-induced air pollution on the air quality related values of the Southern Appalachians.\xe2\x80\x9d\nSAMI consisted of representatives from the eight states in the region, the EPA, the National Park\nService, the U.S. Forest Service, TVA, industries, environmental organizations, and interested\ncitizens. The final report evaluated the need for further emissions reductions and identified the most\ncost-effective approach to minimizing negative effects from air pollution.\nA current spin-off program from SAMI was the Visibility Improvement State and Tribal Association\nof the Southeast (VISTAS), which was formed as a Regional Planning Organization to help develop\nand implement EPA and state air quality plans. VISTAS is a collaborative effort established to\ncoordinate activities associated with the management of regional haze and other air quality issues in\n\nAddendum-3\n\nAir Quality: Decision Support Tools, Partner Plans, Working Groups, Committees\n\nthe southeastern United States. TVA is actively participating in VISTAS meetings and data collection\nactivities. VISTAS seeks to\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\ncreate a visibility database,\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nselect air quality modeling episodes,\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\ndevelop an emissions database, and\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nperform meteorological and air quality modeling.\n\nTVA is conducting research in cooperation with other organizations to address the primary technical\nissues faced by VISTAS.\nThe Aerosol Research and Inhalation Epidemiology Study (ARIES) was initiated in 1997 by the\nElectric Power Research Institute in cooperation with the EPA, the U.S. Department of Energy, and\nseveral electric utilities, including TVA. The study was created to provide science-based knowledge\nthat would help lead to improved air quality and more effective protection of public health. ARIES\ndata collection focused on PM2.5 health effects by providing data for the full range of relevant air\npollutants\xe2\x80\x94gases and particulate matter. TVA has been monitoring fine particulates (i.e., PM2.5) since\n1978, but a comprehensive network did not begin operation until 1999. While measures of larger\npollutant particle size indicate significant improvements over the last two decades, PM2.5\nmeasurements had not been collected long enough to establish meaningful trends. The pertinent data\ncollection effort has been completed; however, work continues on data reduction and analysis.\nTVA also actively participates in the Southern Oxidants Study. The ground-based air quality\nmonitoring stations used in this study can be divided into three groups based on their level of\nsophistication. More than 20 Level-1 monitoring stations provide broad coverage across\nNashville/middle Tennessee and portions of neighboring states. State and local regulatory\norganizations, industries, and others who voluntarily participate in the study operate these ozone and\nfine particle monitoring stations. Two Level-2 chemistry-monitoring stations provide detailed\natmospheric chemistry information on ozone, sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, volatile organic\ncompounds, and nitrogen oxides. These Level-2 stations are polled each day to provide a detailed\npicture of regional and local atmospheric chemistry. A Level-3 research chemistry \xe2\x80\x9csuper station\xe2\x80\x9d is\noperated in Nashville at Cornelia Fort Airpark. This station, located about 8 km northeast of the\nNashville urban core, provides a detailed picture of atmospheric chemistry by using advanced\ndevelopmental measurement techniques to study concentrations of ozone, fine particles, and\nassociated precursor compounds.\nFuture work includes continued modeling, monitoring \xe2\x80\x93 especially PM2.5 monitoring \xe2\x80\x93 and pollution\nchemistry research. An example of a key chemistry research area relates to the aging of airborne\nsulfur compounds to ammonium sulfate. The cycle of decay of long-lived ammonium sulfate,\nalthough not well understood, is a large contributor to haze and particulate pollution. Ground-level\nstation monitoring of ammonium sulfate is not considered sufficient to understand the life cycle and\ndispersion of this compound. Vertical profiles are needed to better confront the problem.\nA synoptic assessment, or mapping, of atmospheric visibility (haze levels) over TVA targeted areas\nwould be helpful to TVA researchers. Moreover, the ability to track where a given air mass has been\n(hindcast), given complex terrain, would be of help to TVA scientists.\n\nAddendum-4\n\nApplied Sciences Program Integrated Product Team for Air Quality\n\nNASA carries out research in several areas relative to the distribution of aerosols in the atmosphere\nand the processes that control aerosol composition. Significant elements of NASA programs include\n1) laboratory and model studies of processes by which aerosol particles form in the atmosphere and\nthe relationship between chemical and physical properties of particles and the conditions under which\nthey form, 2) in situ measurements of particle properties and those of precursor species, typically\nmade through airborne platforms that fly in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere, and\n3) remotely sensed measurements of aerosols, providing some information on properties such as\nconcentration, size distribution, optical depth.\nFor particulate matter studies, column measurements of aerosol presence over land are of interest for\nhaze mapping. The Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment (SAGE III) and the Total Ozone\nMapping Spectrometer (TOMS) can contribute to these measurements. Further, the Moderate\nResolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) could also supply additional related measurements.\nNASA carries out research in several areas relating to the distribution of ozone and other trace gases\nin the global troposphere and to processes that control tropospheric ozone concentrations. NASA\xe2\x80\x99s\ntropospheric chemistry research helps provide a scientific and geophysical perspective for the more\nfocused interest in tropospheric chemistry and air pollution carried out by other agencies.\nParticular elements of related NASA programs include 1) laboratory studies of the chemical processes\nimportant in the chemistry of the global troposphere, including both gas phase and heterogeneous\nchemical processes, 2) in situ and remotely sensed measurements of concentrations of ozone and\nrelated trace gases in the troposphere and stratosphere typically made through airborne platforms, and\ndevelopment of new instrument technology suitable for use on airborne platforms, 3) development of\nlarge regional-scale and global models simulating the trace constituent composition of the global\ntroposphere and the role that chemical, microphysical, and meteorological processes play in\ncontrolling ozone concentrations, and 4) remotely sensed measurements of concentrations of relevant\ngases in the atmosphere.\nFor air contaminant studies, synoptic measurements of tropospheric ozone (column-integrated) made\nby SAGE III and TOMS could be of greatest interest. Measurements of the vertical distribution of\ncarbon monoxide in the troposphere (and total column methane) can be made available from the\nMeasurements Of Pollution In The Troposphere (MOPITT) instrument onboard the Terra spacecraft.\n2.6.4 Conclusions\nTVA has ongoing air quality issues deriving from power generation in the Tennessee Valley region.\nAlthough TVA has and is endeavoring to improve air quality, there is pressure to further increase\npower generation due to a steady growth in area power demand. TVA is partnering with other\nagencies at various levels, as well as with other interested groups, to perform program research and to\nprovide air quality monitoring data, with the goal of further attenuating regional pollutant-related air\nquality problems.\nNASA can make a contribution to the TVA air quality efforts using both in-house technical expertise\n(e.g., prominent technical groups exist at Goddard and Marshall Space Flight Centers) and NASA\nremote sensing data streams. In particular, MODIS, TOMS, SAGE III, and MOPPIT are sensors\nwhose data could be ingested into TVA\xe2\x80\x99s air quality program to aid air quality management\ndecisions. Partnering with TVA is recommended.\n\nAddendum-5\n\nAir Quality: Decision Support Tools, Partner Plans, Working Groups, Committees\n\n2.6.5 Points of Contact\nRoy Teal\nGIS Specialist TVA\nPhone: 423\xe2\x80\x93751\xe2\x80\x936635\nE-mail: rjteal@tva.gov\nPat Hamlett\nGIS-Remote Sensing TVA\nPhone: 423\xe2\x80\x93751\xe2\x80\x932870\nE-mail: pahamlett@tva.gov\nFrancis Weatherford\nSenior Manager for Environmental Technology\nPhone: 256\xe2\x80\x93386\xe2\x80\x932344\nRoger Tanner, Ph.D.\nAir Quality Lead Scientist\nPhone: 256\xe2\x80\x93386\xe2\x80\x932958\nE-mail: rltanner@tva.gov\n2.6.6 Reference Documents\nCarolina Environmental Program, 2005.
