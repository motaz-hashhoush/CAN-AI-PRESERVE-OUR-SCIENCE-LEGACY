Simulations were conducted to assess the feasibility and quantify the fuel and time reguirements for a stranded crewperson to return himself to a space station after an accidental separation. A hand-held thruster, similar to the Hand-Held Maneuvering Unit from the Gemini Program was used for propulsion. Thirty different separation scenarios were composed of three separation rates, five initial spin rates, and ability to use an attitude hold mode in a repeated measures design. Statistically significant results were produced by separation velocity. Fuel, maximum range, time to maximum range, maximum axial range, and final axial velocity increased with separation rate. VIEW was determined to be a useful device for simulating accidental separations, and a hand-held thruster is a viable alternative for accomplishing a self rescue.", "title": "Man overboard - What next?", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-15T13:56:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19920035948, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Brody, Adam R."}, "organization": {"name": "Sterling Software, Inc.", "location": "Palo Alto, CA, United States"}}, "id": "d7b619dd9b984bc9b00953903ad01c45"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19920035948, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Jacoby, Rick"}, "organization": {"name": "Sterling Software, Inc.", "location": "Palo Alto, CA, United States"}}, "id": "3c45dbfa44d34da79ef6fa068914afa7"}, {"sequence": 2, "submissionId": 19920035948, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Ellis, Stephen R."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Ames Research Center", "location": "Moffett Field, CA, United States"}}, "id": "603c090de62344edaf50b566aa96f00e"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-19T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19920035948, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19920035948, "id": "cc7c7f3c11d742a69d1549ad7c1563b6", "publicationDate": "1991-10-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
