Each test circuit\nhas upper and lower layers 14, 16 (Fig. 2) in contact\nA high resistance between opposite\nat interfaces 24.\nends 25, 27 of the interface would indicate poor\ncircuits on the wafer.\nThe test circuit has several\nconductive strips 40 - 42, etc. (Fig. 5), alternating\nbetween the upper and lower layers and connected at\ninterfaces 51 - 53, etc., to form a contact chain. A\ncurrent source 70 (Fig. 4) passes current between tabs\nT2, T23 at opposite ends of the contact chain, so\nthe current is flowing through each interface 51-60\nalong the chain.\nDuring such current flow, voltmeter\nVM takes voltage measurements across pairs of tabs such\nas TI and T4 that are connected to opposite ends of\nan interface 51, to measure the resistance across the\ninterface.\nSuch measurements are taken for eleven sets\nof tabs TI, T4; T3, Tg; and so forth up to tabs\nT21r\nT24=\nThe\nvoltage\nmeasurements\nindicate\ninterface resistance, or conductance. The conductance\nmeasurements can be plotted on a normal probability\ngraph (Fig. 8), with each point such as 106 having an\nordinate R equal to the conductance of a measurement.\nMeasurements of progressively lower conductance are\nlocated at progressively greater abscissa values A with\nrespect\nto a point 104 of lowest abscissa.\nAn\nimaginary straight line 110 closest to the points,\npasses through a conductance level too low for reliable\noperation (e.g., 1 mho) at a probability such as 5N =\n99.999%.\nThis indicates that one in 100,000 interfaces\nwill be defective.\nOne point of novelty is providing multiple pairs\ncf tabs a l m g a centact chair?, with two tabs at the\nends of the chain used to pass current through the\nchain, and the pairs of tabs used to take voltage\nmeasurements\nto\ndetermine\ninterface conductance.\nAnother point of novelty is the plotting of a large\nnumber of conductances on a normal probability graph to\ndetermine the probability of a failure.\n\n86/142\n\nCROSS-CONTACT CHAIN\n\n$\nA\nY\n\nORIGIN OF THE INVENTION\n\ni\n\nThe invention described here,n was made in the\nperformance of work under a NASA contract, and is\nsubject to the provisions of Public Law 96-517 (35 USC\n2 0 2 ) in which the Contractor has elected not to retain\n5 title.\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\nwafer\ncontaining numerous integrated\ncircuits, will\ngenerally\ninclude at\nleast two\nconductive (or semi-conductive) layers, one lying above\nthe other and separated by an insulator, and with the\nlayers interconnected at numerous interfaces.\nHigh\nresistance at such interfaces is a major source of\ndefects.\nOne way to measure interface resistance is to\nform one or more contact chains on the wafer, at\nlocations adjacent to some or all of the integrated\ncircuits.\nEach contact chain has many conductive\nsegments formed in each layer, and the conductive\nsegments are connected in series by interfaces between\nA pair of tabs is provided at opposite\nthe layers.\nends of a chain containing the many interfaces in\nseries, and\nthe\nresistance between the tabs is\nmeasured.\nWhile this can indicate the existence of a\ncatastrophic\nfailure\n(a very\nhigh\nresistance\ninterface), it does not provide information as to the\nresistence at each of the many interfaces.\nThe detection of the resistance at eacn of\nseveral interfaces can be made by providing four pairs\nof terminals or tabs for each interface. Current can\npass between a first pair of tabs while the voltage is\nA\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n-2-\n\n86/142\n\nmeasured across the other pair of tabs, to determine\nthe resistance across that interface.\nHowever, the\nneed for a large number of tabs such as 44 tabs for\ntesting 11 interfaces, gives rise to the problem that\n5 there may not be sufficient room on the wafer for so\nmany tabs.\nA system which facilitated the measurement\nof resistance across each of numerous interfaces while\nminimizing the number of tabs required, and simplified\nthe test instrument requirements, would facilitate the\n10 testing of integrated circuits.\nThe utilization of\nsuch interface measurements to predict the yield of\nintegrated circuits, would be of further value.\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\nIn accordance with one embodiment of the\nsystem\nis\nprovided\nfor\npresent\ninvention, a\nfacilitating the testing of integrated circuits, and in\nparticular the interfaces between different conducting\n(or semi-conducting) layers of a circuit. A contact\nchain can be established beside an integrated circuit,\nthe chain including a plurality of conductive segments\nformed in the two layers, and interfaces between the\ntwo layers for conducting segments in alternate layers\nA first and last conductive tab is\nin\nseries.\nconnected to the end of the chain to enable a current\nto be passed along the chain through its interfaces. A\nplurality of pairs of voltage tabs are provided which\nconnect to the two different layers at each interface\nalong the chain, to enable a voltage measurement to be\nmade across a corresponding interface. While a current\nis\npassing\nalong\nthe length of the chain, the\ninstrument makes voltage measurements across the pairs\nof voltage tabs, to thereby measure the resistance or\nconductances across each of the interfaces.\nThe conductances measured across the numerous\ninterfaces can be plotted on a normal probability\n\n-3-\n\n86/142\n\ngraph, with each point on the graph having an ordinate\nequal to the conductance across an interface, and with\npoints\nof\nprogressively\nlower conductance having\nabscissas progressively further from a minimum abscissa\n5 value\nof\nthe\ngraph.\nA straight line passing\napproximately through the points, can be extended to\nindicate the probability that one of the interfaces\nwill be below a level required for operation of a\ncircuit containing the interface.\nThis enables a\n1 0 determination of the probability of a catastrophic\nfailure of\nan\nintegrated circuit containing the\ninterfaces.\nThe novel features of the invention are set\nforth with particularity in the appended claims. The\n15 invention will be best understood from the following\ndescription when\nread\nin\nconjunction with the\naccompanying drawings.\n\n_.\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\nFig. 1 is a simplified plan view of a workpiece\nconstructed in accordance with the present invention.\n20\nFig. 2 is a sectional side view of an interface\nin the workpiece of Fig. 1.\nFig. 3 is a plan view of a portion of a test\ncircuit of the workpiece of Fig. 1, with the lower\nlayer highlighted by cross hatch-like lines.\n25\nFig. 4 is a plan view similar to that of Fig.\n3 , but showing additional portions of the test circuit.\nFig. 5 is a partial perspective view of the\ntest circuit portion of Fig. 3 .\nFig. 6 is an enlarged view of a portion of the\n30 circuit of Fig. 5.\n7 is a diagrammatic view of a test\nFig.\ninstrument useful with the test circuit of Fig. 3.\nFig.\n8\nis a normal probability graph of\nconductances\nversus\nprobability,\nthat can be\n\n-4-\n\nconstructed\nof Fig. 7 .\n\n86/142\n\nfrom data obtained with the test instrument\n\nDESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS\nFig. 1 illustrates a workpiece 10 in the form\nof a wafer or substrate which contains many integrated\n5 circuits 12.\nEach integrated circuit includes a pair\nof conductive (possibly semi-conductive)- layers that\nare separated with one below the other, but with the\nlayers in contact at interfaces.\n2\nillustrates a portion of such an\nFig.\nwherein a first level\n\n4.c\nlo arrange%tkes\nlayer\n4 / / 7 i t 4 two layers\n\n& & ? a second level metal layer\nbeing isolated by an insulator 18. The\ninsulator 18 has a hole 20 ("Viast1)\nwhich is plated by\na conductor 22 such as a portion of the upper layer\n15 14.\nThe conductor 22 makes contact with the lower\nlayer 16 at an interface 24. The resistance at the\ninterface 24 is preferably as low as possible, but may\nbe unexpectedly high due to oxides and residues. It is\nsuch high\nresistance, or low conductance, at an\n20 interface, which is a major source of faults in the\nintegrated circuits.\nThe interface resistance can be\nmeasured by passing a current between opposite ends 25,\n27 of the interface, and measuring the voltage between\nthe interface opposite ends.\n25\nIn order to determine the condition of the\ninterfaces, test circuits 30 (Fig. 1) can be formed on\nthe same workpiece 10 which contains the integrated\ncircuits.\nThe test circuit includes regions of the\nupper and lower layers 14, 16 and interfaces 24 between\n30 them.\nThe test circuit also has conductive terminals\nor tabs on the surface of the workpiece, where test\ninstruments can make contact with the tabs to measure\nresistance at the interfaces. It may be noted that the\nlines lying\ntest circuits 30 may be placed along lisawvi\n\n-5-\n\n5\n\na\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n:\n...i\n\n...\n\n30\n\n-\n\n35\n\n86/142\n\nbetween the integrated circuits, where they will be\nsawed apart, so as to avoid taking up space that might\notherwise\nbe\noccupied\nby\nadditional\nintegrated\ncircuits.\nIn order that each test circuit can include\nnumerous interfaces, and the resistance across each\ninterface can be individually measured, a considerable\nnumber of test tabs are required. It is desirable that\nthe number of test tabs be minimal, so they occupy a\nminimum of space on the workpiece.\nFig. 3 illustrates a portion of a test circuit\n30 of the present invention.\nThe circuit includes\nnumerous conductive tabs labeled TI, T2, etc., that\nare all formed in the upper layer 14. As also shown in\nFig. 5, a conductive strip 32 is formed in the top\nAnother\nlayer\n14 between\ntabs TI and\nT2.\nconductive strip 34 is formed in the bottom layer 16\nand joins the tabs T3 and T4 through interfaces. A\nthird conductive strip 36 in the upper layer joins tabs\nT5 and Tg.\nThe conductive strips have conductive\nsegments 40, 41, 42, 4 3 , etc., which alternate between\nthe upper and lower layers 14, 16 and which are\ninterconnected by interface joints or interfaces 51,\n52, 5 3 , etc.\nThese interfaces 51, 52, etc., are\ninterfaces whose resistance or conductance can be\nmeasured by the method and apparatus of the present\ninvention.\nAs indicated in Fig. 3, one way for measuring\nthe interface resistance across the interface 51 is to\npass a current lgigl\nbetween tabs TI and T4, so that\ncurrent passes through the interface 51. While such a\ncurrent is flowing, a voltmeter 62 is connected to tabs\nT3.\nTab T2 is connected to the upper\nT2\nand\nlayer at the interface 51, while tab T3 is connected\nthrough an interface 64 and conductive segment 41 to\nthe bottom layer at the interface 51. Since current is\nflowing between the t o p and bottom layers at the\n\n-6-\n\ni\n\nJ\n\n..\n-5\n\n86/142\n\ninterface 51 and the voltmeter is connected to the\nupper and lower layers at the interface, the voltage is\nproportional to the resistance across the interface.\nFor example, if the current i is 100 microamperes and\n5 the voltage measured by the meter 62 is 10 microvolts,\nthen the resistance across the interface 51 is 0.1 ohms\nand the conductance is 10 mho. While it is possible to\nrepeat this procedure for each of the interfaces 51,\n52, etc., applicant simplifies the procedure by passing\n10 a\ncurrent through the entire chain of conductive\nsegments and then measuring the voltage across the\npairs of tabs connected to opposite sides of each\ninterface.\nBy applying current only once, applicant\navoids the additional time required in each application\n1 5 of current, to wait for the current to settle down to a\nsteady-state condition.\nFig. 4 illustrates a preferred test set-up for\na test circuit 30 containing eleven interfaces whose\nresistance can be measured.\nThe conductive segments\n2 0 40, 41, 42, etc., are arranged along an imaginary line\nsegment 81, with a pair of current tabs T2, T23 at\nopposite ends, and with voltage tabs along opposite\nA current source 70 is\nsides of the line segment.\napplied\nbetween tabs T2 and T23, so the current\n25 flows between conductive strips 40, 41, 42, etc.,\nlocated on the alternate layers, with the current\nflowing through the interfaces 51-60, etc., in passing\nbetween the layers. This establishes a predetermined\ncurrent through each of the eleven interfaces 51-60.\n30\nWhile the current is flowing, a voltmeter 62\nmeasures the voltage between a pair of tabs T1 and\nT4 which are in contact with opposite sides of the\ninterface 51.\nAfter this voltage measurement, the\nvoltmeter is connected between a next pair of tabs T3\n35 and T6 to measure the voltage across interface 52.\nThe voltage measurements continue across the tab pairs\n\n-7-\n\n,\n\n. I\n\n,\n\nd\n\n86/142\n\nT5 and T8, and T7 and T ~ o , and so forth, until\nthe tabs T21 and T24.\nThus, the test chain which\nenables the measurement of resistance or conductance\nacross each of eleven interfaces, requires eleven pairs\n5 of tabs plus two tabs for the current source. Since\nthe voltmeter 62 has a very high input impedence, its\nconnection to the different pairs of tabs creates\nnegligible transients, and the measurement of voltages\nacross eleven pairs of tabs can be conducted rapidly.\n10 After the voltages across one test circuit 30 are\ncompleted, the test instrument can be moved to another\ntest circuit on the wafer by lifting its twenty-four\ncontacts off the tabs T1-T24 of one test circuit\nand repositioning them on the test tabs of the next\n15 circuit.\nIt can be seen in Fig. 5 that the conductor\nportion, such as 72, which leads from the location\nwhere an interface 52 contacts the lower layer 16,\nextends from a side of the interface. Fig. 6 shows the\n20 general paths 73, 74, 75 of current flow between the\nconductive strip 41 and the interface conductor 2 2\nwhich extends up to the upper layer.\nMuch of the\ncurrent i flows into the "front" 76 of the interface,\nwhile a significant portion flows into the sides 77, 78\n25 of the interface.\nVery little current flows into the\nrear 79.\nThe lower layer 16 is generally of a material\nof much higher resistivity than the upper layer 14.\nAccordingly, a\nvoltage measurement taken a small\n30 distance from the front 76 will include a voltage drop\ndue to current flow through a length of the resistive\nOn the other hand, a voltage measurement\nstrip 41.\ntaken a distance from the rear 79 where there is almost\nno current flow, will not include some of the voltage\n35 drop caused by currents 73-75 passing through the front\nand sides of the interface. Applicant takes a voltage\n\n..\n\n-8-\n\n4\n\nJ\n\ni\n\n,\n\n86/142\n\nmeasurement from a side 77 (which leads to conductor\nportion 72 which extends to tab T3), whose voltage is\naffected by much of the voltage drop through the\ninterface but very little of the voltage drop along the\n5 current carrying strip 41.\nHaving the conductor 72\nextending from a location angled about 90\xc2\xb0 from the\nllfrontl\'\nlocation 76, with respect to an interface axis\n81 normal to the lower layer and passing through the\ncenter of the interface, also enables the same voltage\n10 measurement whether from one side 77 or the other 78.\nIn one test circuit, the conductors 41, 72 have a width\nW of three microns, while the interface has a width I\nof two microns.\n7 is a simplifed diagram of a test\nFig.\n15 instrument 80. The instrument has twenty-four contacts\nlabeled C1-C24 which match the twenty-four tabs on\na test circuit.\nA current source 70 is connected\nacross the tabs C2 and C23.\nA group of relays 82,\n84, 86, 88, etc., can be alternately closed to connect\n20 a\npair\nof\ncontacts\nsuch as C1 and C4 to an\nThe output of amplifier 90 can be\namplifier 90.\ndelivered to a voltmeter 60, a memory 92, and a plotter\n94.\nAfter each voltage measurement is taken, one of\nthe relays 82 is opened, and the next relay such as 84\n25 is closed.\nA control 96 turns on the current source\n90, waits a short period of time for the current to\nsettle, and then cycles the relays 82, etc., in\nsequence.\nA wafer 10 (Fig. 1) may contain eighty-eight\n30 integrated circuits and eighty-eight test circuits 30,\nwith each test circuit having perhaps eleven interfaces\nwhose resistance is measureable.\nThus, about one\nthousand\ninterface\nresistance, or\nconductance,\nmeasurements can be made.\nSuch a large number of\n35 measurements can be used to predict the probability of\nthe integrated circuits faiiing because of excessive\n\n-9-\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n86/142\n\nresistance at one of their interfaces. Each integrated\ncircuit may have perhaps 1,000 interfaces. As shown in\nFig. 8, applicant establishes a predetermined minimum\ninterface conductance level such as 1 mHo (1 ohms\nresistance), or even 0 mho, at which an integrated\ncircuit\nis\nlikely to\nfail.\nThe conductance\nmeasurements at the eleven interfaces of each of the\neighty-eight test circuits is then plotted on a normal\nprobability graph of the type shown in Fig. 8.\nA multiplicity of points 100 are established on\nthe graph of Fig. 8, with each point having an ordinate\nR equal to the conductance measured in a measurement.\nPoints of progressively lower conductance have an\nabscissa A that is progressively further from a minimum\nabscissa value 102. The points are spaced apart along\nthe abscissa at probability intervals S about equal to\none divided by the total number of points. Thus, if\n1,000 measurements are taken, the first point 104 (of\ngreatest conductance) will be at the abscissa value of\n0.001, or 0.1%.\nThe next point 106 will be at the\nabscissa value 0.2%, etc.\nWhen plotted on a normal\nprobability graph of the type shown in Fig. 8 , points\nfurther\nfrom\nthe minimum abscissa level will be\nprogressively closer together up to the probability of\n50%;\nbeyond 50% the points will be progressively\nfurther apart in the abscissa direction. An imaginary\nstraight line 110 is fitted to the curve so that it is\nclose to lying on all of the points (at least the\nmajority of points of lowest conductivity). The line\n110 can be extended to provide a useful measurement.\nIt can be seen in Fig. 8 that the point 112\nrepresenting the lowest conductance for all 1,000\nmeasurements is still considerably above the lowest\n(If the lowest\nacceptable level which is one mho.\nacceptable level is much less than 10 mho, zero can be\nused as the lower level). The extension portion 114 of\n\n-10-\n\n..\n\nI\n\n86/142\n\nthe line 110 will intercept the minimum conductance\nlevel at a point 116 (representing five nines, or\n99.999%).\nThe probability of an interface having such\na low conductance is indicated along the abscissa of\n5 the graph at the point 116, where the probability is 1\n- 99.999% = 0.001%. In other words, the probability is\n1/100,000 that an interface conductance will drop below\nthe minimum permissible level for circuit operation.\nWhere each integrated circuit has 1,000 interfaces,\n10 this indicates that only 1 circuit out of 100 is likely\nto have a failure. Fig. 8 shows another graph 120 for\nthe test circuits on another wafer, where the average\nconductance is lower than in the graph 110. However,\nthe line 120 connecting conductances arranged in order\n15 of\nconductance on the probability graph, shows a\nsmaller slope of conductivity decrease with order of\nprobability.\nThe graph 120 intersects the minimum\nconductance\nlevel at\nthe\npoint 122, where the\nprobability is 99.9999%, meaning that the probability\n20 of an interface failure is 1/1,000,000. The normal\nprobability graphs of Fig. 8 can be plotted by hand or\nby a plotter as shown at 94 in Fig. 7 .\nThus, the invention provides a test method and\napparatus for facilitating the testing of interfaces\n2 5 between a pair of at least partially conductive layers\non a workpiece which holds one or more integrated\nA test circuit includes a contact chain with\ncircuits.\nmultiple conductive segments alternating between the\ndifferent\nlayers and connected in series through\n30 interfaces connecting the beginning of a segment on one\nlayer to the end of a segment on another layer. The\nchain includes a pair of end tabs at opposite ends of\nthe chain of conductive segments, for passing a current\nthrough the chain, and pairs of tabs spaced along the\n3 5 chain and that are connected to the opposite sides of\nA test instrument\neach interface along the chain.\n\n-11-\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n86/142\n\nincludes a current source for passing current between\nthe end tabs and contacts for measuring the voltages\nacross each pair of tabs that are connected to the\nopposite sides of each interface along the chain. The\nconductance measurements can be plotted on a normal\nprobability\ngraph\nwith\nmeasurements\nof\nlower\nconductivity spaced progressively along the abscissa.\nA straight line drawn through the points will then pass\nthrough a minimum conductance level at a discernable\nprobability level.\nOne minus that probability equals\nthe probability of failure of a single interface on the\nworkpiece, such as in a test circuit or the integrated\ncircuit.\nAlthough\nparticular\nembodiments of\nthe\ninvention have been described and illustrated herein,\nit is recognized that modifications and variations may\nreadily occur\nto those skilled in the art, and\nconsequently, it is intended that the claims be\ninterpreted\nto\ncover\nsuch modifications\nand\nequivalents.\n\nc\n86/142\n\nCROSS-CONTACT CHAIN\n\nABSTRACT OF THE DISCLOSURE\nA system is provided for use with wafers that\ninclude multiple integrated circuits that include two\nconductive layers in contact at multiple interfaces.\nContact\nchains are formed beside the integrated\n5 circuits, each contact chain formed of the same two\nlayers as the circuits, in the form of conductive\nsegments alternating between the upper and lower layers\nand with the ends of the segments connected in series\nA current source passes a current\nthrough interfaces.\n10 through the series-connected segments, by way of a pair\nof current tabs connected to opposite ends of the\nseries of segments.
