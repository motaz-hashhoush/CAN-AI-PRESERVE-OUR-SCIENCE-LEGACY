We present a Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy analysis of fragments from several stones of the meteorite. Methods and analysis: Infrared spectra of samples SM2 and SM12 were recorded with a Nicolet iN10 MX FTIR microscope in the mid-IR range (4000-650/cm; spectral resolution 4/cm), while samples SM20 and SM30 were analyzed with a synchrotron-based Nicolet Continuum IR microscope in the same range. Samples were deposited on a clean glass slide, crushed with either a stainless steel roller tool or between 2 slides, and placed directly on the focal plane of the microscopes. Results: IR spectra of non-fusion crust samples show several absorption features associated with minerals such as olivines, phyllosilicates, carbonates (calcite and dolomite), and pyroxenes, as well as organics [2]. The carbonates display a main, broad band centered at 1433/cm, with additional bands at 2515/cm, 1797/cm, 882/cm, and 715/cm. Features associated with phyllosilicates include a symmetric Si-O stretching mode band centered at 1011/cm and several O-H stretching mode bands\u2015a broad band centered at 3415/cm that is probably due to adsorbed H2O, and occasionally a much weaker, narrower feature centered near 3680/cm due to structural O-H. Features observed in the 2985-2855/cm range suggest the presence of aliphatic -CH3 and -CH2- groups. However, some of these bands show unusual relative intensities, mainly because of carbonate overtone bands that fall in the same spectral range, which can make the identification of C-H stretching bands problematic. The positions and relative strengths of the aliphatic -CH2- and -CH3 features, where they can be distinguished from overlapping carbonate bands, are consistent with those in interplanetary dust particles (IDPs) and Murchison. Finally, the absence of a strong C=O absorption feature near 1700/cm distinguishes the organics in the Sutter's Mill meteorite from that in most IDPs and in Murchison, but is consistent with the organic matter in Tagish Lake.
