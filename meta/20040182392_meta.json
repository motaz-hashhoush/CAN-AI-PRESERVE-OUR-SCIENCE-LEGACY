Major aspects of the current system, such as capacity, safety, mobility, customer satisfaction, security, communications, and ecological effects, require improvements. The changing dynamics - increased presence of general aviation, unmanned autonomous vehicles, military aircraft in civil airspace as part of homeland defense - contributes to growing complexity of airspace. The system has proven remarkably resistant to change. NASA Langley Research Center and the National Institute of Aerospace conducted a workshop on Transportation Network Topologies on 9-10 December 2003 in Williamsburg, Virginia. The workshop aimed to examine the feasibility of traditional methods for complex system analysis and design as well as potential novel alternatives in application to transportation systems, identify state-of-the-art models and methods, conduct gap analysis, and thus to lay a foundation for establishing a focused research program in complex systems applied to air transportation.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20040182392, "endDate": "2003-12-10T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "Workshop on Transportation Topologies", "location": "Williamsburg, VA", "id": "4bf66ee349764f098d870af62eecfaa3", "startDate": "2003-12-09T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20040182392, "id": "424f76845e744622b32a66ee5155f05d", "publicationDate": "2004-10-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 20040182395, "type": "ANALYTIC_SUBSIDIARY", "title": "Network Theory: A Primer and Questions for Air Transportation Systems Applications", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20040182392.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20040182392/downloads/20040182392.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20040182392/downloads/20040182392.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20040182392/downloads/20040182392.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
