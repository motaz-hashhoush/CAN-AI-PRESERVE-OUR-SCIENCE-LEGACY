Dumbacher, Deputy Director\nStephen A. Cook, Director\nExploration Launch Office\nNASA Marshall Space Flight Center\nAbstract\nThe U.S. Vision for Space Exploration (January 2004) serves as the foundation for the National\nAeronautics and Space Administration\xe2\x80\x99s (NASA) strategic goals and objectives.\xe2\x80\x99 As the NASA\nAdministrator outlined during his confirmation hearing in April 2005, these include:\nFlying the Space Shuttle as safely as possible until its retirement, not later than 2010.\n* Bringing a new Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV) into service as soon as possible after Shuttle\nretirement.\nDeveloping a balanced overall program of science, exploration, and aeronautics at NASA,\nconsistent with the redirection of the human space flight program to focus on exploration.\nCompleting the International Space Station (ISS) in a manner consistent with international partner\ncommitments and the needs of human exploration.\n* Encouraging the pursuit of appropriate partnerships with the emerging commercial space sector.\nEstablishing a lunar return program having the maximum possible utility for later missions to\nMars and other destinations.2\nIn spring 2005, the Agency commissioned a team of aerospace subject matter experts to perform the\nExploration Systems Architecture Study (ESAS). The ESAS team performed in-depth evaluations of a\nnumber of space transportation architectures and provided recommendations based on their findings? The\nESAS analysis focused on a human-rated Crew Launch Vehicle (CLV) for astronaut transport and a\nheavy lift Cargo Launch Vehicle (CaLV) to carry equipment, materials, and supplies for lunar missions\nand, later, the first human journeys to Mars. After several months of intense study utilizing safety and\nreliability, technical performance, budget, and schedule figures of merit in relation to design reference\nmissions, the ESAS design options were unveiled in summer 2005. As part of NASA\xe2\x80\x99s systems\nengineering approach, these point of departure architectures have been refined through trade studies\nduring the ongoing design phase leading to the development phase that begins in 2008. Comprehensive\nreviews of engineering data and business assessments by both internal and independent reviewers serve as\ndecision gates to ensure that systems can fully meet customer and stakeholder requirements. This paper\nprovides the current CLV and CaLV configuration designs and gives examples of the progress being\nmade during the first year of this significant effort.\nSafe, reliable, cost-effective space transportation systems are a foundational piece of America\xe2\x80\x99s future in\nspace and the next step in realizing the plan for revitalizing lunar capabilities on the passageway to the\nhuman exploration of Mars. While building on legacy knowledge and heritage hardware for risk\nreduction, NASA will apply lessons learned from developing these new launch vehicles to the growth\npath for future missions. The elements for mission success and continued U.S. leadership in space have\nbeen assembled over the past year. As NASA designs and develops these two new systems over the next\ndozen years, visible progress, such as that reported in this paper, may sustain the national will to stay the\ncourse across political administrations and weather the inevitable trials that will be experienced during\nthis challenging endeavor.\n1\n\nAIAA Joint Propulsion Conference, July 9\nPaper due NLT June 15,2006\n\n- 11,2006\n\nI. Introduction\nThe U.S. Vision for Space Exploration and the US. Space Transportation Policy direct NASA to design\nand develop a new generation of safe, reliable, and cost-effective transportation systems to help fulfill the\nNation\xe2\x80\x99s strategic goals and objectives relative to assured access to space! These new launch vehicles\nwill provide the capability for astronauts to conduct scientific exploration that yields new knowledge from\nthe unique vantage point of space. American leadership in opening new frontiers will improve the quality\nof life on Earth for generations to come.\nThe Exploration Launch Projects (ELP) office was chartered in September 2005 by the Exploration\nSystems Mission Directorate (ESMD) and the Constellation Program to deliver operational CLV and the\nCaLV systems that meet or exceed customer and stakeholder requirements, fielded on time and within\nbudget.

The CLV will loft the CEV into LEO.\n\n2\n\nAIAA Joint Propulsion Conference, July 9 - 11,2006\nPaper due NLT June 15,2006\n\nThe Exploration Launch Projects ofice, located at NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Marshall Space Flight Center, is responsible\nfor designing, developing, testing, and evaluating (DDT&E) the CLV that will loft the CEV into LEO,\nand the heavy lift CaLV, which will deliver the Lunar Surface Access Module (LSAM) to LEO, for\nastronaut return trips to the Moon in preparation for the eventual first human footprint on Mars. The lunar\nmission scenario (Fig. 3) begins with the CaLV delivering the Earth Departure Stage (EDS) carrying the\nLSAM to orbit, where the CEV, launched on the CLV, will rendezvous with the LSAM before beginning\nAmerica\xe2\x80\x99s seventh trip to the Moon.\n\nFig. 3. Lunar mission scenario.\n3\n\nAlAA Joint Propulsion Conference, July 9\nPaper due NLT June 15,2006\n\n- 11,2006\n\nWorking closely with NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Constellation Program and ESMD, the ultimate goal of the Exploration\nLaunch Projects office is to deliver safe, reliable launch vehicle systems designed to minimize life-cycle\ncosts so that NASA\xe2\x80\x99s budget can be more fully invested in the \xe2\x80\x9cwhy\xe2\x80\x9d of exploration, rather than on the\n\xe2\x80\x9chow\xe2\x80\x9d. Applying almost 50 years of aerospace lessons learned, and building modern process and product\nimprovements into proven legacy hardware, are prime strategies to ensure mission success. With the \xe2\x80\x9ctest\nas you fly\xe2\x80\x9d philosophy, eventual flight-testing will prove the mettle of both hardware systems and\noperations staff, leading to fully operational launch vehicle fielding.\nGiven below is information about NASA\xe2\x80\x99s systems engineering approach to delivering hardware and\noperational solutions, along with a few of many success stories that have been documented over the past\nyear. For example, during this time, the Exploration Launch Projects office has built a team with\nnationwide participation from across NASA Centers and the aerospace industry. As is outlined below, the\nELP is systematically delivering measurable inch-stones along the path leading to well-defined milestone\nreviews by internal and independent panels. A series of NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Exploration Systems progress reports,\nalong with other documents, provides regularly released news that is available through the NASA Web\nsite.5\n11. Systems Engineering Approach\nThe Exploration Launch Projects\xe2\x80\x99 formulation, or design, phase began in September 2005, using ESASrecommended architecture options as points of departure for trade studies leading to the optimum vehicle\ndesigns to be developed in the implementation, or production, phase, which begins in 2008.6 As a result\nof this systems engineering approach, in February 2006, the Agency streamlined its CLV DDT&E\nhardware plan so that the CLV first stage booster and upper stage engine are largely extensible to the\nCaLV booster stage and EDS propulsion elements, saving billions of dollars in nonrecurring investment.\nHardware commonality between the two vehicles will help reduce the logistics footprint, including\nmanufacturing, processing, and launch facilities, as well as decrease both recurring and nonrecurring\noperations expenses.\nFurthermore, in May 2006, the ESAS-recommended CaLV configuration was updated to reflect the\nfindings of engineering analyses and business planning conducted in spring 2006. As a result, the baseline\nCaLV configuration saves on DDT&E costs and reduces life-cycle expenses by changing from a proposed\nmodified Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME), which was designed for robust reusability, to a\ncommercially available, expendable engine better suited for the CaLV mission; specifically, using the\nliquid oxygedliquid hydrogen (LOWLH2) RS-68 engine, which was developed by the U.S. Air Force\nand is currently flown on the Delta IV heavy lift vehicle. This is an example of how engineering analyses\nthat are conducted in tandem with cost estimating and acquisition planning yield options that fulfill\nrequirements while giving the best value for the investment made. Further details are given in the CaLV\nsection below.\nCurrent Vehicle Configurations\nFig. 4 shows expanded views of the current CLV and CaLV reference designs. The CLV will loft the 25\nmetric ton (55,000 pounds of mass (lbm)) CEV into orbit early next decade. This system is estimated to\nbe 10 times safer than the Shuttle due to its in-line configuration, which places the crew above the rocket,\nand the integrated CEV launch abort system (LAS), which can rapidly move the crew away in case of an\nemergency. The CaLV system, slated for fielding late next decade, can lift 136 metric tons (300,000 lbm)\nto a 30-by-160 nautical mile (nmi) orbit inclined at 28.5 degrees, or 55 metric tons (120,000 Ibm) to translunar orbit. Preliminary schedules and flight profiles are shown in the CLV and CaLV sections below.\n4\n\nAlAA Joint Propulsion Conference, July 9\nPaper due NLT June 15,2006\n\n- 11,2006\n\nI\nLAS\n\n(3\n\n#\n\nInstrument Unit\n\nComposite Shroud\n\nAscent Stage }LSAM\nDescent Stage\n\nCEV (Crew Module I Service Module)\n\n\xe2\x80\x98 SDacecraft Adaoter\nI\n\nEs m\nc2 z\n\nLOWLH,\nOne J-2X Engine\nA I 4 TankslStructures\n\nForward Skirt\nUpper Stage\n\nInterstage\n\nJ-2X Upper Stage Engine\n\nn\n\nL..\n\ns.l lnterstage\n* Forward Frustum\n.\n\nl!2aGmQ\nLOWLH,\n\nFive RS-68 Engines\nAI-Li TankdSttuctures\n\nFirst Stage\n(FiveSegment Reusable\nSolid Roclcet Booster (RSRB))\n\nFive-Segment RSRBs\n\n3\n\nCLV\n\nCaLV\n\nFig. 4. CLV and CaLV expanded views.\n\nRisk Reduction\nSystems engineering reduces risk by providing a strong linkage between and among disparate engineering\ndisciplines, from aerodynamics and avionics to mass properties and thermal control. The ELP Vehicle\nIntegration Element understands the synergy that results when the pieces are integrated into the whole\nsystem and is invested with the methods and means to ensure correct and proper functionality. Through\nsystems engineering, trade study analyses are performed to determine the optimum solutions that fulfill\ncustomer and stakeholder requirements, focusing on the \xe2\x80\x9c-ilities,\xe2\x80\x9d such as reliability, maintainability,\nsupportability, and operability.\nThe Exploration Launch Projects office implements stringent systems engineering standards to improve\naccuracy and reduce rework. A robust vehicle integration element facilitates communication via\nembedded touch-points throughout the various hardware offices, as well as through on-site resident staff\nmembers located at geographically dispersed business units, including contractor facilities. Following a\nrigorous configuration management process improves clarity across the various Government and\ncontractor work in progress.\nWithin the systems engineering function, integrated product teams report through a board structure to the\nproject- and program-level control boards (CB) (Fig. 5). This hierarchy is documented in the Exploration\nLaunch Projects Systems Engineering Management Plan.\xe2\x80\x99 To spur innovation, decision-making is pushed\nto the lowest level possible. For example, the Vehicle Integration Control Board (VICB) defines and\nreviews the results of systematic design analysis cycles, during which trade studies are conducted and\nfindings reported. The approval chain for decisions that must be made at higher levels, such as changes to\nthe baseline vehicle configurations, is captured in the SEMP and in the Exploration Launch Projects\nConfiguration Management Plan.8\n\n5\n\nAlAA Joint Propulsion Conference, July 9\nPaper due NLT June 15,2006\n\n- 11,2006\n\nI\n\nGO Prolect\n\nELP CB\n\nVERB\nt\n\nI\n\nI\n\n1\n\nCorestage\nECB\n\nI\n\nIC3\nTcl\nCore Stage\n\n,\n\n~\n\nCCB\n\nCon\'racfor\nCCB\n\nI\n\nSoftware\n\nLegend:\nCxCB -Constellation Systems Control Board\nCCB - Configuration Control Board\nECB -Element Control Board\nERB -Engineering Review Board\nGO - Ground Operations\nVERB -Vehicle Engineering Review Board\n\nFig. 5. NASA achieves configuration control through interrelated boards.\nAs specified in the NASA instruction on program and project management, a series of internal and\n\nindependent reviews is conducted throughout the project\'s life cycle to serve as check-points for a\nnumber of engineering products, such as drawings and specifications, and to gauge technical progress\nagainst established funding guidelines and schedule milest~nes.~Non-advocate\nreviews survey technical\nand programmatic documentation and provide forums for interactive discussions relative to project\nprogress. The series of CLV and CaLV top-level reviews is listed in Table 1 below.\nReview Title\nSystem Requirements Review\n\n(SRR)\nPreliminary Design Review\n(PDR)Critical Design Review\n(CDR)\nDesign Certification Review\n(DCR)\nFlight Readiness Review\n(FRR)\n\nI\n\nI\n\nReview Purpose/Outcome\nAssures that requirements are properly defined, verifiable, and implemented, are\ntraceable, and that the hardware and software are designed and built to the authorized\nbaseline configuration.\nProvides completed design specifications, the identification and acquisition of longlead items, manufacturing plans, and life cycle cost estimates; the design is 30%\ncomplete and element specifications are baselined.\nDiscloses the complete system in full detail; ascertains that technical problems and\ndesign anomalies have been resolved; and ensures that the design maturity justifies\nthe decision to begin fabricatinghnanufacturing,integration, and verification of\nmission hardware and software. The design is 90% complete.\nServes as the control gate that ensures the system can accomplish its mission goals.\nRequirements are verified in a manner that supports launch operations.\nAfier the system has been configured for launch, the FRR process examines tests,\ndemonstrations, analyses, and audits that determine the system\'s readiness for a safe\nand successful launch and for subsequent flight operations. The Project Manager and\nChief Engineer certify that the system is ready for safe flight.\n\n6\n\nAlAA Joint Propulsion Conference, July 9\nPaper due NLT June 15,2006\n\n- 11,2006\n\nAs is shown in Fig. 6, the ESMD Implementation Plan flows into the Constellation Architecture\nRequirement Document, which informs the CLV and CaLV System Requirements Documents. At lower\nlevels, each launch vehicle system is governed by an Interface Requirements Document, which details the\nvarious linkage points (such as command and control, power, communications, and mechanical\ninterfaces), and by an operations concept, which covers the multitude of aspects that go into integrating\nthe vehicle subsystems, stacks, and payloads. Furthermore, a series of flight demonstrations -from\nsimulators to high-fidelity vehicles - will provide the opportunity to validate modeling and simulation,\ntest mission scenarios and the humadmechanical interface, and hrther influence integration decisions.\nThese and other risk mitigation strategies are being employed to improve communication and increase the\nlikelihood of mission success.\n\nFig. 6. High-level requirements flow down to system requirements to facilitate integration.\n111. CLV Progress\nAs an integral part of NASA\xe2\x80\x99s design approach, CLV requirements are being validated by conducting\n\nrigorous systems engineering trades studies against the concept design through a series of design analysis\ncycles, leading to an SRR that is scheduled for 2006. The SRR is the first major milestone in CLV\ndevelopment; it assures that CLV requirements are properly defined and implemented, are traceable, and\nthat the hardware and software will be built to the authorized baseline configuration requirements. The\nSRR confirms that the total CLV system -and the individual first stage, upper stage, and upper stage\nengine elements\xe2\x80\x99 design and interface requirements - are defined before proceeding to the PDR.\nCompleted design specifications will be provided at the PDR, planned for 2008. The Critical Design\nReview, projected for 2009, will verify that the CLV system design meets requirements, establish quality\nassurance plans, and baseline the \xe2\x80\x9cbuild to\xe2\x80\x9d specifications. The DCR, projected for 2012, is the control\ngate that ensures the CLV system can accomplish its mission goals. In addition to these documentation\ndata reviews, the CLV path to flight includes verification flight-testing beginning in the 2009 timeframe,\nleading to the first flight of a crew to the ISS no later than 2014.\nFig. 7 provides the CLV preliminary integrated master schedule, which captures lower-level hardware\nelement schedules. The notional CLV flight profile is shown in Fig. 8.\n\n7\n\nAlAA Joint Propulsion Conference, July 9\nPaper due NLT June 15,2006\n\nY.*NDdmmRCU\n\n- 11,2006\n\na.L.l.DI\n\nFig. 7.

Notional CLV flight profile.\nWind Tunnel Testing\nDozens of wind tunnel tests have been conducted on various-sized CLV scale models (see Fig. 9) to\nassess three-dimensional geometric configurations before more detailed engineering designs are\nproduced. For example, in late 2005, the Aerodynamic Research Facility at the Marshall Space Flight\nCenter provided data from 66 wind tunnel tests conducted using a 16.5-inch scale model, to help rocket\nengineers determine flight performance characteristics. The CLV scale model included the full take-off\nload, including the crew capsule, service module, and LAS tower.\n\n8\n\nAIAA Joint Propulsion Conference, July 9\nPaper due NLT June 15,2006\n\n- 11,2006\n\nP\n\n--\n\nI\n\nFig. 9. Wind tunnel test.\nEngineers also conducted flow visualization tests that identified shock waves and component expansion\nsimilar to that experienced during supersonic flight. It also provided CLV configuration data for guidance,\nnavigation, and control (GN&C) subsystem analysis. This series of tests was performed over a range of\n0.5 to 4.96 Mach. The data obtained provided the foundation for more detailed testing during the spring\nand summer 2006, using larger vehicle models in facilities such as those at the Langley Research Center\nand the Ames Research Center.\nStatic Test Firing\nATK Thiokol is the prime contractor for the CLV first stage. As the Shuttle Program made preparations\nto fly, a 2-minute test of the RSRB was performed at the ATK Launch Systems test facility (see Fig. 10).\nThe flight support motor burned the same amount of time as that for an actual Shuttle launch. The test\narticle had over 1 17 instrumentation channels to capture data for dozens of objectives. Analysis results\nhave a dual benefit for the Shuttle Program and the CLV first stage element. As reported in Aviation\nWeek and Space Technology, the extensibility from the Shuttle RSRB to the CLV first stage and the\nCaLV propulsion system \xe2\x80\x9celiminates the need to start from square one. At the same time, it draws on\nworkforce experience built up over the past quarter century.\xe2\x80\x9d l o\n\nFig. 10. RSRB static test firing, April 2006.\n\n9\n\nAlAA Joint Propulsion Conference, July 9\nPaper due NLT June 15,2006\n\n- 11,2006\n\nUpper Stage Request for Information\nA series of well-planned acquisitions has kept CLV work moving at a brisk pace. To illustrate, in spring\n2006, a request for information was issued to the aerospace community for strategic input on\nmanufacturing the CLV upper stage, which is an in-house NASA design. Responses received addressed\nboth technical and business challenges. In particular, approaches were sought to combining avionics or\non-board electrical flight controls and guidance systems into the overall upper stage procurement. NASA\nalso received feedback related to design and specification sharing among participants, commonality of\ndesign tools and software, methods of reducing component life-cycle costs, and seamless transition of\ncontractual arrangements.\nFollowing receipt of this information from interested parties, NASA conducted a well-attended open\nhouse at the Government-owned/contractor-operatedMichoud Assembly Facility (MAF) -a one-of-akind facility where, currently, the Shuttle External Tank is manufactured and shipped to the Kennedy\nSpace Center (KSC). The CLV upper stage and the CaLV EDS will be manufactured and assembled at\nMAF.\nUpper Stage Engine Injector Performance Testing\nSeveral candidate J-2X injector designs were tested in spring 2006, as a risk reduction strategy to increase\nconfidence that the design can produce the specific impulse (Isp) needed for both the CLV and CaLV\napplications (see Fig. 11). The testing reflected the engine\xe2\x80\x99s operating conditions anticipated for the\ninaugural flights of both vehicles and yielded data that is helping engineers determine the simplest design\nthat atomizes the propellant for the complete combustion with stable operation to meet performance\nrequirements.\n\nFig. 11. J-2Xinjector performance test.\nSeveral subscale candidate designs were investigated and anchored to current and historical engines to\npromote a highly reliable and affordable J-2X engine design to propel the CLV and CaLV. This test\nseries, conducted at the Marshall Space Flight Center, verified how the C-star efficiency changes as a\nfunction of element density for the proposed injector designs. It also validated the system level power\nbalance, for which C-star is the single most important variable. Although the CLV is due to be fielded\nfirst, this is an example of how common hardware, such as the J-2X engine, also is helping the CaLV\neffort progress.\n\n10\n\nAlAA Joint Propulsion Conference, July 9\nPaper due NLT June 15,2006\n\n- 11,2006\n\nTest as You Fly\nIntegrated flight-testing is a key risk mitigation strategy, and the plan includes both ascent (suborbital)\nflight development tests and orbital flight tests. In May 2006, the Constellation Program Control Board\napproved a proposed initial flight test to be conducted in 2009 to provide data that will be timely to the\nCritical Design Review. A sample of top-level CLV flight-test objectives include demonstration of:\nAscent flight control system performance with dynamically similar first and upper stage\nCLVKEV.\nNominal first and upper stage separation and clearances.\nCEVLAS performance during a post-staging abort from initiation to water landing and recovery.\nSignificant reductions in launch processing time and required resources, as well as built-in test\navionics.\nFlight-testing of increasingly high-fidelity hardware configurations has a dual benefit of validating a\nmultitude of launch vehicle processing, integration, and operations scenarios, while providing real-world\nmission training and problem-solving experience. Operability and supportability must be built into the\nsystems and culture, knowing that two key CLV operations requirements are launch availability and fixed\nand variable recurring costs. In keeping with this business philosophy, the ELP effort includes early\nintegration with operators and astronauts to ensure that they influence requirements and design.\n\nIV. CaLV Progress\nThe current CaLV configuration is at an earlier design stage than is the CLV. However, recent studies\nhave been conducted to determine mutual requirements between this system and the CLV system. Also,\nnear-term technical work associated with modifying the RS-68 core stage engine is in progress. Both of\nthese efforts are summarized below.\n\nTo provide a frame of reference, the preliminary CaLV integrated master schedule is shown in Fig. 12\nand the concept vehicle notional flight profile is given in Fig. 13.\n\n,\n:\nPOI1\n\n-n\n\nj\n.\n\n:\n\n.\n:\n\n.\n:\n\n..\n,\n\n:\n\n.\n\nFig. 12.

CaLV flight profile.\nRequirements Maturation\nThe Exploration Launch Project Crew Launch Vehicle/Cargo Launch Vehicle Commonality Assessment\nwas conducted by a panel of aerospace experts in May 2006." Personnel included all disciplines involved\nin the design, development, or integration of the vehicles, as well as representatives from contractors with\nexperience in the various heritage Apollo and Shuttle systems that will be leveraged in the design of the\nnew vehicles. With the impending concurrence of the CLV SRR and CaLV Initial Requirements Review,\nit was imperative to determine which CaLV requirements might have the most significant impact on the\ndesired commonality between the two vehicles, major issues not covered by the CaLV concept, and major\nrisks for the current concept based on expert opinion and qualitative analysis.\nThe panel\'s discussion of the RSRB revolved primarily around structural, avionics, and propulsion\nconsiderations. Structural risks included differences in the loads due to the single-stick CLV\nconfiguration versus the multiple-body geometry CaLV configuration. Different requirements for the\nforward and aft skirts may place some structural commonality at risk, but the conclusion was that\nsignificant commonality exists between the two vehicles. Avionics risks revolved around single booster\nrequirements for the CLV, versus dual boosters on the CaLV. Propulsion risks included RSRB thrust\nmismatch requirements for the CaLV and performance penalties associated with using the CLV thrust\ntrace. A session was conducted to address the CaLV core stage and core stage engine environments\nencountered during flight, and the potential for debris generation at RSRB ignition or liftoff. The session\nalso addressed required RS-68 modifications, both for performance gains and safety improvements to\nmaintain the vehicle\'s human-rating option. A number of modifications are needed, chiefly, reduction of\nfree hydrogen at engine start and the engine\'s current excessive helium requirements for launch pad\noperations.\n\n12\n\nAlAA Joint Propulsion Conference, July 9 - 11,2006\nPaper due NLT June 15,2006\n\nConfiguration Refinements\nAs stated earlier, the Constellation Program Control Board approved refining the CaLV configuration in\nMay 2006 to include the RS-68 engine, which was designed for low development and operations costs,\nand is in the process of being upgraded. Near-term NASA participation reduces Constellation Program\nschedule risk. In addition, high-level discussions are in progress with other Government agencies for\npotential collaboration, which may reduce cost risk. Subsequent flights of upgraded RS-68 engines on the\nDelta IV will yield valuable performance data that can be directly applied to the CaLV, reducing technical\nrisk. By contrast, the SSME has not been built in over a decade, was estimated to be twice as expensive\nafter modifications for expendability, and was rated highly complex compared to the relatively simple\nRS-68. The loss of mission estimate for the refined CaLV configuration is approximately equivalent to\nthat of the previous ESAS design option.\nThe RS-68 engine is the most powerful liquid oxygen/liquid hydrogen booster now in existence. When\nmodified to meet NASA\xe2\x80\x99s standards (see Fig. 14), the five-engine cluster will exceed Program\nrequirements, delivering an additional 4 metric tons of cargo to space. Studies are being conducted to\ndetermine future human-rating potential.\nAll petfomance upgrades are needed to meet CaLV mission requirements\n\n+ 3D wrapped turbine nozzles\n\n\\\n\nAllows for increased nominal\npower level from 102% to 106%\n\n3\n\n+ Higher Element Denslty\nMain Injector\n\n+ Ablative Nozzle Redesign\nfor Increased Mission Duratio\nOption: Regeneratively\nCooled Nozzle\n\nL\n\n+ CaLV Cluster Specific\nModify turbine exhaust ducting for\nengine cluster application\n\nFig. 14.

Conclusion: A New Era of Space Exploration\nAs the Exploration Launch Projects organization designs and develops systems capable of returning\nastronauts to the Moon, it marshals systems engineering methodology and tools to ensure that designs\nsatisfj customer and stakeholder requirements. This approach builds on lessons learned from decades of\naerospace knowledge and draws upon the experience of some of the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s top rocket engineers from\nGovernment and industry. In this way, technical, budget, and schedule risks are reduced, safety and\nreliability confidence is increased, and the probability of mission success is enhanced.\n\nWhile NASA looks to the past for wisdom, it applies modern systems engineering and management\npractices and processes to ensure technical performance is accurately reflected in, and inextricably\nconnected to, budget allocations and schedule milestones, with a primary focus on safety and reliability\nand reduced operations costs. Building on a foundation of legacy knowledge and heritage hardware\nincreases the prospect of mission success in the complex business of space exploration. Sustainable\ntransportation solutions will promote an industry that may be embraced by new generations of explorers\non fresh journeys of discovery that will re-vector commonly held knowledge and open a frontier of\ninfinite possibilities.\n\n15\n\nAlAA Joint Propulsion Conference, July 9\nPaper due NLT June 15,2006\n\n- II,2006\n\nReferences\n1.
