The alternating direction code was also established on the NASA Langley computer system and is available for use there. In essence, grid points are moved on an abstract surface above physical space by means of alternating coordinate directions. The abstract surface is formed with the salient solution properties if they can be extracted by a priori physical reasoning; or otherwise, in the absence of such reasoning, by the use of error estimates in some chosen norm. Upon formulation, all important driving properties for adaptive purposes are consolidated into one object - the abstract surface. At a basic level, a uniform distribution of surface points is equivalent to gradient resolution. This arises from a projection back down into physical space. At a higher level, a more accurate view of the abstract surface is obtained when changes in surface direction are also resolved. The appropriate measure for direction changes is normal curvature. It is defined as the rate of change of surface tangent planes as a surface coordinate curve is transversed in uniform increments of arc length.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19840009873, "id": "c2dfbb3dd57946508f1e370ba77ceecf", "publicationDate": "1983-10-31T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19840009873.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19840009873/downloads/19840009873.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19840009873/downloads/19840009873.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19840009873/downloads/19840009873.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
