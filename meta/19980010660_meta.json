Below are listed publications for the past two and a half years that came out of this work. The main thrusts of the research involved: (1) showing under what conditions atmospheric O2 and O3 can be considered as evidence for life on a planet's surface; (2) determining whether CH4 may have played a role in warming early Mars; (3) studying the effect of varying UV levels on Earth-like planets around different types of stars to see whether this would pose a threat to habitability; and (4) studying the effect of chaotic obliquity variations on planetary climates and determining whether planets that experienced such variations might still be habitable. Several of these topics involve ongoing research that has been carried out under a new grant number, but which continues to be funded by NASA's Exobiology program.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19980010660, "id": "667af03486884d9dba9371453b715b34", "publicationDate": "1997-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19980010660.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19980010660/downloads/19980010660.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19980010660/downloads/19980010660.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19980010660/downloads/19980010660.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
