b'F\n\nWater\n\nFilter\n\ndevelopment,\n\nWhenRay\nWard moved from Utah to Arizona,\nhe didn\'t like the taste of the water, so he decided\nto\ndevelop\nhis own water filter. Today, only five years\nlater, he is president\nand board chairman\nof Bon Del\nManufacturing\nCompany,\nMesa, Arizona,\nwhose filters\nare sold worldwide\nby some 20,000 distributors.\nDuring extensive\nresearch\non various types of\nsystems, Ward learned\nof a NASA unit designed\npurify water supplied\naboard the Space Shuttle\nDeveloped\nby Chemtric,\nInc. Rosemont,\nIllinois.\ncompact,\ngenerates\n\nlightweight\nelectrolytic\nwater\nsilver ions_in\nconcentrations\n\nfiltering\nto\nOrbiter.\nA\n\nsterilizer,\nit\nof 50 to 100\n\nparts per billion_in\nthe water flow system. The silver\nions serve as an effective\nbactericide/deodorizer.\nWard\nreceived\ntechnical\ninformation\nfrom NASA on the\nsterilizer\nand used it as the basis for his own\n\nwhich\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nis known\n\nas the Bon\n\nDel\n\nBacteriostatic\nWater Filter. Ward had originally\nnot\nplanned\nto manufacture\nthe unit, simply to build a filter\nfor personal\nhome use. But friends\nand neighbors\nwho\nlearned of the unit wanted\none; their\nlaunched\na booming\nbusiness.\nAbout the size of a thermos\nbottle,\n\nrapid\n\nacceptance\n\nthe Bon\n\nDel filter\n\nattaches\nto a faucet. Tap water passes through\na filtering\nelement\nof silver which has been chemically\nplated onto\nactivated\ncarbon.\nThe silver inhibits\nbacterial\ngrowth\nwhile the activated\ncarbon\nremoves\nobjectionable\ntastes\nand odors caused by addition\nof chlorine\nand other\nchemicals\nto the municipal\nwater supply. Bon Del\nproduces\nthe filter in three models: a kitchen\nunit (upper\nleft), the company\'s\nbest seller; a "Tourister"\nunit\nfor portable\nuse while traveling\n(upper right); and a\nrefrigerator\nunit that attaches\nto the ice cube water line.\nA filter will treat 5,000 to 10,000 gallons\nof water. Bon Del\nis introducing\nnew designs\nin 1982.\n\n65\n\n'
