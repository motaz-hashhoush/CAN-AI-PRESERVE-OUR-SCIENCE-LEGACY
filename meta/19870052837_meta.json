It is shown that there is a gradual decrease in the duration of high-speed streams from the declining phase of solar cycle 20 through the ascending phase of cycle 21 and a corresponding decrease in the annual average of the proton speed toward solar maximum. Beta, the ratio of the proton thermal pressure to magnetic pressure, undergoes a significant solar cycle variation, as expected from the variation in the IMF. Individual hourly averages of beta often exceed unity with 20 cases exceeding 10 and one case as high as 25. The Alfven Mach number shows a solar cycle variation similar to beta, lower aboard solar maximum. High-speed streams can be seen clearly in epsilon and the y component of the interplanetary magnetic field.", "title": "Solar cycle variations in the solar wind", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-13T04:55:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19870052837, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Freeman, John W."}, "organization": {"name": "Rice Univ.", "location": "Houston, TX, United States"}}, "id": "087c8c13547340f9853ac05c3cd8f26c"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19870052837, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Lopez, Ramon E."}, "organization": {"name": "Rice University", "location": "Houston, TX, United States"}}, "id": "4e1fef08388546b59ae0dec48ba3f255"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-18T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19870052837, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19870052837, "id": "82212003b045469d89f043dfaea1474d", "publicationDate": "1986-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
