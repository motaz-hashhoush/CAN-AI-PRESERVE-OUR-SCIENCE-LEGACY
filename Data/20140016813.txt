simply\nintegrate and fly as a technology demonstration mission.\n\nNear-term Events\n\nNear-term system performance characterization at NASA.\n\nClosing Remarks\n\xef\x83\x98 The iSAT project is a fast pace high value iodine Hall technology demonstration mission\n- Partnership with NASA GRC and NASA MSFC with industry partner \xe2\x80\x93 Busek\n\xef\x83\x98 Propulsion remains a key limiting capability for SmallSats that Iodine can address\n- High ISP * Density for volume constrained spacecraft\n- Indefinite quiescence, unpressurized and non-hazardous as a secondary payload\n\xef\x83\x98 Iodine enables MicroSat and SmallSat maneuverability\n- Enables transfer into high value orbits, constellation deployment and deorbit\n\xef\x83\x98 Iodine may enable a new class of planetary and exploration class missions\n- Enables GTO launched secondary spacecraft to transit to the moon, asteroids, and other interplanetary\ndestinations for ~$150M full life cycle cost including the launch\n\xef\x83\x98 ESPA based OTVs are also volume constrained and a shift from xenon to iodine can significantly increase\nthe transfer vehicle \xe2\x88\x86V capability or enable additional secondary payloads for increases revenue potential.\n\xef\x83\x98 The project team has made and continues to make significant progress towards risk reduction:\n- Flight-like operational feed system demonstration\n- DCIU development and testing\n- Integration propulsion system testing\n- Materials testing\n- Power control and distribution avionics design and development\n- Solar panel and battery testing\n- Preliminary flight software development\n- Structural design and analysis and thermal design and analyses.\n\xef\x83\x98 The iSAT mission is an approved project with PDR in October of 2014 and is targeting a flight opportunity\nin FY17.\n\nQuestions?\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nResources were provided for this work in part by the MSFC Center Innovation Fund\nfrom the Office of the Chief
