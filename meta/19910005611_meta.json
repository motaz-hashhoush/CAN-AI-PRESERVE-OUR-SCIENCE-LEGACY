An unexpected red light excess was also noticed in a high latitude dark cloud L 1780. The fluorescence was attributed to hydrogenated amorphous carbon by Duley (1985), on the basis of laboratory work. Alternatively, transitions between electronic states of free polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon molecules, by-passing the cascade along the vibrational states was considered. In L 1780, the red excess was related to the 12 micron emission detected by IRAS. A quantitative comparison of the intensity of the red fluorescence and that of the 3 to 12 micron features is thus warranted in helping assess the physical properties of large interstellar molecules. The red fluorescence radiation, F(R), appears as a bump on the spectra between 0.6 and 0.9 micron. Values were deduced from the spectra for HD 44179, and for the high latitude cloud L 1780. Corrections for the extinction, both interstellar and internal to the nebulae, were included. The 3 to 12 micron brightness, F(IR), was obtained through integration of the spectra for NGC 2023, and for HD 44179 after removal of a smooth continuum due to hot large grains. The values of the ratio of fluorescence flux to the infrared flux, F(R)/F(IR), are summarized. Red fluorescence and infrared radiation are two separate ways to access to the size of the molecules through observation, and it is rewarding that both approaches give similar results. These findings bring a striking coherence into the physical description of the particles, and add further support to the initial attribution of the infrared features to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs).", "title": "Red fluorescence and 3-12 micron emission in NGC 2023, HD 44179, M 82, and Lynds 1780", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T14:07:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19910005611, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Ryter, Charles"}, "organization": {"name": "Commissariat a l'Energie Atomique", "location": "Gif-sur-Yvette (France)., United States"}}, "id": "a20ca078c09e435a93dd7833d25c5050"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19910005611, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Dhendecourt, Louis B."}, "organization": {"name": "Paris VII Univ."}}, "id": "b84b44fb5a9341f6b479b621751c516d"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19910005611, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19910005611, "id": "80cb7d7db27841958c393371a2572552", "publicationName": "NASA, Ames Research Center, Interstellar Dust: Contributed Papers", "publicationDate": "1989-12-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19910005611.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19910005611/downloads/19910005611.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19910005611/downloads/19910005611.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19910005611/downloads/19910005611.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
