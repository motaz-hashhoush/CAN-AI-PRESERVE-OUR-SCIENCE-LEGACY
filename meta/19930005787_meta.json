On the Indian Ocean side, the Agulhas Current with its tributaries form a conduit through which much of the southern Indian Ocean surface flow is focused. South of the continent, this flow is fragmented and partially injected into the Atlantic Ocean and across the Subtropical Convergence into the Southern Ocean. To the west of the subcontinent, the circulation of the South Atlantic subtropical gyre in the Cape Basin interacts with the vigorous Benguela upwelling regime. The creation, transformation, and transport of water masses and the intra-annual and climatic importance of all these processes have been specifically recognized by the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE). The South African TOPEX/POSEIDON Altimeter Experiment addresses many of these issues through four mutually complementary and interrelated subprojects.", "title": "South African TOPEX/Poseidon altimeter experiment", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-16T04:55:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19930005787, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Gruendlingh, Marten L."}, "organization": {"name": "National Research Inst. for Oceanology", "location": "Stellenbosch, South Africa"}}, "id": "0c51f9af88504417a314f6c7523f6b73"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19930005787, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Shannon, L.
