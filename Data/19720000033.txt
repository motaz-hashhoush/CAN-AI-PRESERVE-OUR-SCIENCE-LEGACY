The device consists of an analog\ntransformation network and a flying spot scanner. Data\n(for example a multispectral video input) on known terrain classifications (bare soil, grass, pine forest, etc.) are\nused to prepare a scatter diagram of 2000 points. The\nvariables describing the terrain are grouped in independent pairs, converted to voltage signals and displayed on\nan oscilloscope screen as coordinates in a two dimensional system. The scatter diagram is the resultant plot\nof these 2000 inputs.\nThe unknown terrain is analyzed using these same\nvariables. The variables are grouped as before, converted\nto voltage signals and displayed on an oscilloscope over\nwhich a negative transparency of the scatter diagram\nhas been placed. The oscilloscope beam is defocussed to\nilluminate an area much larger than the area of the individual dots. The resulting intensity seen through the\ntransparency is related to the number of dots in the area\nand consequently the probability that the unknown terrain is the same as the terrain classification defined by\nthe transparency. A flying spot scanner exposes a film\nwith an intensity proportional to the intensity seen on\nthe oscilloscope screen. The film image is a map defining\nthe probability that the unknown terrain is the known\n\ninput. If the scanner scans at the same rate that the unknown terrain was originally viewed, a one-to-one correlation between the probability map and the unknown\nterrain results.\nThis information should be of interest to manufacturers and .users of remote sensing equipment. Since\nthe analyzed terrain need not be limited to topographical or geographical features but may be an array of\ntransistors or a sheet of metal, this innovation may have\nfurther application in automated quality control.\n\nNote:\nRequests for further information may be directed\nto:\nTechnology Utilization Officer\nManned Spacecraft Center, Code JM7\nHouston, Texas 77058\nReference: TSP72-10033\n\nPatent status:\nNo patent action is contemplated by NASA.\nSource: R.
