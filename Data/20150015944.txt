Currently, the airworthiness definition does not exist for designing and\nmanufacturing composite hardware at the National Aeronautics and Space\nAdministration (NASA) Armstrong Flight Research Center. Engineers are limited to\nimplementing solutions which may be less appropriate for a particular design than a\ncomposite solution. Armstrong\xe2\x80\x99s Aerostructures, Operations Engineering, Structural\nFabrication, and Aircraft Support branches have drafted a framework by which to design\nand build airworthy composite parts. The goal of my summer project is to exercise the\nframework with a test case that starts with hardware requirements and concludes with an\nairworthy part. A wing-to-body fairing from a Global Hawk UAV was selected as the test\npiece to design my component around. Using a 3D scanning device, the shape of the\nfairing can be digitally reproduced and uploaded in the Pro Engineer 3D modeling\nprogram. This scanned model can then be made into a mold from which my component\ncan be fabricated. The goal of this step is to develop a repeatable, robust manufacturing\nprocess which takes into account the mold type, mold treatment, release, ply angle\ntolerance, matrix application, cure cycle, et cetera. A combination of finite element\nanalysis, witness coupons, and non-destructive evaluation standards will be used to\nprove the airworthiness of the finished part. This project demonstrates the feasibility of\nairworthy composite component fabrication at Armstrong. Running through this process\nfrom the design stage all the way to the finished component stage, will prove to be a\nvaluable learning experience for the Armstrong team. Lessons learned during this\nexercise will help to minimize complications seen while working with more missioncritical or expensive components in the future.\n7\n\nNASA Armstrong Flight Research Center\n\nSummer 2015\n\nJoaquin Martinez\nCalifornia State University Long Beach\n\nAeronautics Scholarship\nProgram\nUndergraduate Intern\nMechanical Engineering\n\nMentor: Tim Cox\nCode: RC\nDynamics and Controls\n\nDeveloping a Research Test Bed for Small UAV\xe2\x80\x99s\nThe mass moment of inertia is a measure of how much an object will resist\nangular acceleration in a specified axial direction. This property can be used\nin flight to better understand how control surfaces of an aircraft will affect the\npitch, roll, and yaw of the aircraft. My project over the summer was to create\nmultiple technical models, such as an inertia and aerodynamic model, of an\naircraft called Hugh . To calculate the inertia of the aircraft, the aircraft was\nhung from a test rig, and then the nose of the aircraft was perturbed to initiate\na lightly damped oscillatory response. The measured frequency of the\nresponse was used to calculate the inertia in that axis. The aerodynamic\nmodel of the aircraft was estimated using flight data gathered on the aircraft\nduring a previous flight and a program called Parameter Estimation (PEST).\nPEST uses aircraft dimensions and moments of inertia with the equations of\nmotion to iterate aerodynamic derivatives until the estimated time history\nresponses match the flight data. These aerodynamic derivatives are then used\nto create an aerodynamic model of the aircraft. These models will allow any\nfuture researcher working on or conducting experiments with Hugh to have a\ncomplete model of the dynamics of the aircraft and hence allow them to\nconduct more precise experiments.\n8\n\nNASA Armstrong Flight Research Center\n\nSummer 2015\n\nBenjamin Martins\nUniversity of California, San Diego\n\nAeronautics Scholarship\nProgram\nGraduate Intern\nAerospace Engineering\n\nMentor: Francisco Pena\nCode: RS\nFiber Optic Sensing Laboratory\n\nUtilizing Dynamic Strain Measurements for Applications in Structural\nHealth Monitoring\nIn-situ structural health monitoring has gained increasing research attention\nin recent years as a way to increase the utility of aging metallic and\nadvanced composites as primary structural components in aerospace\nstructures. Successful implementation of a structural health monitoring\nsystem would usher in the transition from time-based to condition-based\nmaintenance in aircraft structures, with associated advantages, like advanced\ncertification methods, improved operational efficiency, and increased safety.\nThe current research focuses on utilizing a network of strain based fiberoptic sensors which can provide both global behavior as well as localized\nimpending damage of metallic and composite structures. The lightweight,\neasily multiplexed fiber-optic strain sensors make it possible to establish an\nin-situ, large scale, distributed network of thousands of sensors with\nnegligible weight penalty. Strain data from the fiber-optic sensors is used to\ndevelop the frequency response functions (FRFs) for a structure at thousands\nof points. Comparing the FRFs obtained by the optical strain sensors at\nvarious points in time allows for the detection of changing structural\nproperties which are fundamental to structural health monitoring.\n9\n\nNASA Armstrong Flight Research Center\n\nSummer 2015\n\nMichael Arreola-Zamora\nUniversity of California, Los Angeles\n\nAerospace Education Research\nOperations (AERO) Associates\nUndergraduate Intern\nMathematics\nAstrophysics\n\nMentor: Kurt Kloesel\nCode: RA\nAerodynamics and Propulsion\n\nThermodynamic Modeling of a Turbine Engine Using the Brayton Cycle\nThe purpose of this project is to construct a Brayton cycle thermodynamic\nmodel of a turbine engine. Using a fifteen pounds-force micro-turbine\nengine, data was obtained and used to theorize the operation of larger\nturbines. The engine controller is a necessity to the operation of the turbine\nand receives inputs: RPM, temperature, and user throttle. This information is\nused to control the engine fuel pump flow rate. Modern engine controllers\nhave an automated fuel ramp sequence allowing users to avoid damaging the\nturbine. This ramp sequence gradually rises as each received input rises,\ninforming the fuel pump and user if any errors occur (Ex. temperature too\nhigh). The knowledge and simulation of these ramping functions will assist\nin the implementation of a hybrid turbo electric airplane control system. This\nwill help reduce both emissions and the consumption of fuel for larger\naircrafts. The use of this information can make future aircrafts more efficient\nby allowing them to travel greater distances. With further investigation, this\nmodel can be used as a basis for turbine engines used in the future for\nelectric powered airplanes.\n10\n\nNASA Armstrong Flight Research Center\n\nSummer 2015\n\nNathan Bell\nUniversity of California, Los Angeles\n\nAerospace Education Research\nOperations (AERO) Associates\nGraduate Intern\nPhysics\n\nMentor: Al Bowers\nCode: R\nResearch and Engineering\nDirectorate\n\nPrandtl Propeller Design\nA propeller functions like a rotating wing, creating thrust as it rotates in the\nsame way that a wing produces lift. Unlike a wing, however, the velocity of\na propeller blade is not constant all the way out to the tip. The blade velocity\nincreases with the radius, causing most of the thrust to be generated nearer to\nthe blade tip. This velocity causes an increase in induced drag and torque.\nAccordingly, there is a need for modifications to propeller design to mitigate\nthese problems and increase propeller efficiencies. The objective of this\nproject is to design a more efficient propeller by applying techniques\npreviously used on the Prandtl wing design. Specifically, the bell-shaped lift\ndistribution of the Prandtl will be applied to the blades. Using XROTOR , a\npropeller design and analysis program, the blade geometry will be altered in\niterations and analyzed until the desired thrust distribution is achieved.\nPrimarily, the blade twist will be altered. The propeller will then be tested to\ndetermine its actual performance, and the required changes will be made to\nthe propeller design. By the end of the design process, a propeller will have\nbeen produced displaying increased thrust with reduced induced drag and\ntorque.\n11\n\nNASA Armstrong Flight Research Center\n\nSummer 2015\nOlivia Bosma1\nEmbry Riddle Aeronautical\nUniveristy\n\nTaylor Jensen2\nAntelope Valley College\n\nAlexander Chen3\nDuke University\n\nAerospace Education Research Operations (AERO) Associates1,3\nUniversities Space Research Association (USRA) 2\nUndergraduate Interns\nAerospace Engineering1\nEngineering & Law2\nBiomedical Engineering3\n\nMentor: Albion Bowers\nCode: R\nResearch and Engineering Directorate\n\nSimulation\nBirds have kept the secret of flight locked in their wings for millions of\nyears. Understanding the flight of birds seems simple enough, but with a\nslightly different structure used for human flight, it is no easy task. The\nPrandtl wing is the first refined aircraft of its kind, complete with no vertical\ntail and wing twist/taper, mimicking a similar body structure as birds.\nWhen an aircraft is in the research stages, pilots perform doublets, which are\ncertain maneuvers that agitate roll, pitch, and yaw. For Prandtl, the remote\ncontrol surface still produces noise. With autopilot included, noise can be\nreduced and human error can be eliminated, so data analysis becomes easier.\nOne way to make sure autopilot works is to create a simulation that will\nallow for accurate predictions as to how the Prandtl wing behaves with\nautopilot. Simulations provide valuable information, by both providing\nconfidence in the system and revealing issues in the program that can be\nevaluated. With a simulation, other autopilot functions including the rumble\ncan be analyzed for correct behaviors and proper responses.\n12\n\nNASA Armstrong Flight Research Center\n\nSummer 2015\n\nTyler Clinkaberry\nUC Santa Cruz\n\nAerospace Education Research\nOperations (AERO) Associates\nUndergraduate Intern\nComputer Engineering\n\nMentor: Bob Guere\nCode: MR\nRange Operations\n\nRadio Frequency Communications\nIn the Range Operations Branch, communication systems are very important\nin ensuring everything runs smoothly by making sure the entire team can\nstay in contact, and that data can be collected from aircraft. Gregory\nStrombo supports improvements to the International Space Station (ISS)\nVery High Frequency (VHF) communication system, and he is working with\nme to create a Simulink model of the Human Space Flight V1 Emergency\nCommunications System. This project is intended to improve system\ndocumentation by creating a block diagram that numerically describes the\nradio frequency characteristics of each component, and the system as a\nwhole. The Simulink model will enable the user to quickly evaluate alternate\nconfigurations, enhancements, or be incorporated into larger models for\ninter-system analyses. This allows for further improvement of the system,\nand increasing the speed at which improvements are made. Lastly, my\nproject will include an evaluation of the predicted system performance in\ncomparison to measured system performance. Model validation will consist\nof comparing predicted signal loss and reflected power to measured system\nS-parameters. This new capability will lead to better signal output and more\nreliable communications with the ISS.\n13\n\nNASA Armstrong Flight Research Center\n\nSummer 2015\n\nOr Dantsker\nUniversity of Illinois\n\nAerospace Education Research\nOperations (AERO) Associates\nGraduate Intern\nAerospace Engineering\n\nMentor: James Murray\nCode: RA\nAerodynamics and Propulsion\nBranch\n\nLEAPTech HEIST Wing Pressure Distribution\nThe Leading Edge Asynchronous Propeller Technology (LEAPTech) project\nwill test the premise that tighter propulsion-airframe integration, made\npossible with electric power, will deliver improved efficiency and safety, as\nwell as environmental and economic benefits. An experimental wing, called\nthe Hybrid-Electric Integrated Systems Testbed (HEIST), was fabricated and\nmounted on a specially modified truck to experimentally measure the\nefficiency improvement. Instead of being installed in a wind tunnel, the\nHEIST wing section will remain attached to load cells on a supporting truss\nwhile the vehicle is driven at speeds up to 70 miles per hour across the\nlakebed at NASA Armstrong. In order to assess the efficiency of the wing,\npressure taps were installed along circumference of several sections, inboard\nand outboard of a wing mounted motor. Given the data generated by these\nports, I will calculate the pressure distribution along those sections, which\nwill be used in the future to determine the lift, drag, and moment created by\nthe wing. Performing this data reduction for a variety of wing and propulsion\nconfigurations will help to judge the efficiency of the wing.\n\n14\n\nNASA Armstrong Flight Research Center\n\nSummer 2015\n\nBryce Doerr\nUniversity of Minnesota-Twin Cities\n\nAerospace Education Research\nOperations (AERO) Associates\nUndergraduate Intern\nAerospace Engineering\n\nMentor: Manny Castro\nCode: ME\nSimulation Engineering\nBranch\n\nPRANDTL-D Aircraft Flight Simulation\nThe primary objective of the PRANDTL-D aircraft simulation is to validate\nLudwig Prandtl\xe2\x80\x99s theory that a bell-shaped lift distribution, as opposed to the\naccepted elliptical lift distribution, across the aircraft wingspan is more\nefficient for flight. The bell-shaped distribution causes proverse yaw, which\ncounteracts adverse yaw, eliminating the need for a rudder as the aircraft will\ncease to yaw in an undesired direction during roll maneuvers. The\nPRANDTL-D aircraft simulation and flight tests are the few ways to prove\nthe efficiency of the bell-shaped lift distribution. In order to verify the bellshaped lift distribution of the aircraft via simulation, the Coresim used in the\nSimulation Branch will be adapted for the aircraft. Although the simulation\ncode has been refined with models of other aircraft, the simulation code must\naccommodate the aerodynamics, mass, and control surfaces of the\nPRANDTL-D aircraft. Aerodynamic and mass data will be taken from the\naircraft to simulate the aircraft accurately in the simulation environment. An\nemphasis will be the testing of the aircraft simulation in a similar manner\nwith the flight tests to verify the flight data. This method will allow further\nproof of the aircraft performance characteristics and support Prandtl\xe2\x80\x99s theory\nof a bell-shaped distribution as the overall most efficient lift distribution.\n15\n\nNASA Armstrong Flight Research Center\n\nSummer 2015\n\nLouis Edelman\nUniversity of California, Davis\n\nAerospace Education Research\nOperations (AERO) Associates\nUndergraduate Intern\nAerospace Science &\nEngineering\n\nMentor: Claudia Herrera\nCode: RS\nAerostructures\n\nACTE Structural Dynamics Analysis\nThe Adaptive Compliant Trailing Edge (ACTE) experiment installed on the\nSubsoniC Research Aircraft Testbed (SCRAT) G-III aircraft seeks to\ndemonstrate the structural effectiveness of a compliant lifting surface under\nthe unsteady aerodynamic loads of flight. ACTE technology promises a\nlightweight high-lift device capable of spanwise lift distribution adjustment,\nwhile maintaining a continuous outer mold line. As a part of the NASA\nEnvironmentally Responsible Aviation initiative, ACTE promises a 3.5\npercent drag reduction when retrofitted to an existing design and up to 12\npercent on a clean sheet design.\nThe technology has flown over the past year and is preparing to extend the\ntest campaign into the transonic regime. Before the flight envelope can be\nextended, it is necessary to analyze the performance of each ACTE\ncomponent in order to fully understand the aeroelastic dynamics and safety\nof flight. The development of a flight condition cross-comparison tool allows\nengineers to analyze how aerodynamic, vibrational, and structural\nparameters influence each other and change over the flight envelope.\n16\n\nNASA Armstrong Flight Research Center\n\nSummer 2015\n\nLindsay Flasch\nThe University of Tulsa\n\nAerospace Education Research\nOperations (AERO) Associates\nUndergraduate Intern Primary Mentor: Steve Jensen\nElectrical Engineering Code: RT\nSecondary Mentor: Fred Reaux\nCode: RD\nResearch and Development\n\n7-Output DC Power Supply\nDirect current (DC) power supplies are often used on test benches to give the\nproper power to run the test equipment. Their use comes from their ability to\nsupply a range of voltages and currents at great accuracy. Power supplies are\na necessity for any lab environment where electronics are being tested. Many\ntypes of complex circuits, especially those that are used in aviation, require\nseveral different voltages to run. A circuit board may have a microcontroller,\na sensing unit, and a microprocessor that all require a different voltage.\nNormally this would take two to three power supplies to run this board. Not\nonly would this take up a lot of space, but it would also use up a lot of power\nsupplies. The more power supplies being used on one project, the fewer that\nwill be available for other projects. A possible solution to this problem is to\ncreate a power supply with more than one or two outputs. My project is to\nhelp design a 7-output DC power supply. This power supply will give out\n3.3V, 5V, 28V, \xc2\xb115V, and \xc2\xb1adjustable voltage from .3V to 10.5V. The\nconstant voltages were chosen because they are some of the most commonly\nused voltages for electronic equipment. Designing a power supply requires\nknowledge of electronics and programming. The intern will need to learn to\nprogram in Spin, the language of the microcontroller that will be used. This\nmicrocontroller will control all aspects of the power supply, but the roll of\nthe intern will be to program the touch screen interface of the supply.\n17\n\nNASA Armstrong Flight Research Center\n\nSummer 2015\n\nLogan Francisco\nEmbry-Riddle Aeronautical University\n\nAerospace Education Research\nOperations (AERO) Associates\nUndergraduate Intern\nSoftware Engineering\n\nMentor: Allen Parker\nCode: RD\nElectronic Instruments Systems\n\nRaspberry Pi Communications and Data Retrieval\nData communication is perhaps the most common yet unrecognized\nprocedure in the modern world. What most people don\xe2\x80\x99t think about, though,\nis all the technical interaction underneath the convenient and common\nproducts and processes that go on every day. However, these processes aren\xe2\x80\x99t\ndone automatically when on the forefront of research. For instance,\ncollecting data from numerous liquid metal strain gages (LMSG) , which\nsense expansion and contraction, in a viable and cohesive manner requires\ninterfacing with multiple platforms. These platforms include the sensors\nthemselves to collect data, the microcontrollers to control the sensors, and\nthe method of data retrieval whether that be storing the raw data or exporting\nthe data to a computer to interpret it. My part is to use a Raspberry Pi (a\nsmall, but powerful Linux-based computer) to interface between the\nmicrocontrollers and the outside world wirelessly. The Raspberry Pi will be\n\xe2\x80\x9cstacked\xe2\x80\x9d with eight LMSGs to both collect data and organize data in a\ncohesive manner suitable for wireless communication to be interpreted by\nLabView on a computer. By accomplishing this, researchers will be dealing\nwith a more convenient and standardized process to hopefully accelerate\nresearch as field testing will not only be easier, but far more efficient.\n18\n\nNASA Armstrong Flight Research Center\n\nSummer 2015\n\nJeremy Germita\nNASA headshot\nhere\nDimensions:\n2.59\xe2\x80\x9d x 2.08\xe2\x80\x9d\nHorizontal\nposition: 1.14\xe2\x80\x9d\nVertical position:\n2.05\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nAntelope Valley College\n\nAerospace Education Research\nOperations (AERO) Associates\nUndergraduate Intern\nComputer Science\n\nMentor: Matt Reaves\nCode: RT\nVehicle Integration and Test\n\nSOFIA Water Vapor Monitor Temperature Safety Switch\nMany instruments and sensors are quite sensitive to temperature conditions.\nWhen operating these at temperatures higher than their rated temperatures,\nwe risk damaging critical components or gathering faulty data. The Strategic\nObservatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA) Water Vapor Monitor (WVM)\nis no exception.\nThe temperature safety switch is a component designed to switch-adjust the\npower to the WVM in response to the temperature. However, due to the\ninductive properties of many electrical components, it is extremely\ndangerous to rapidly switch an electrical system on and off. To mitigate this\neffect, the temperature safety switch is designed to switch the system off at\n105 degrees Fahrenheit, and not restore power until the system ambient\ntemperature returns to a safe lower threshold of 90 degrees Fahrenheit. This\nmethod prevents a \xe2\x80\x9cping-pong\xe2\x80\x9d effect in which power would be restored and\ncut at a rapid rate due to the temperature rising and falling.\nThe temperature safety switch system aims to protect the electrical\ncomponents within the WVM from both temperature stresses and electrical\ninductive stresses, to allow the WVM to safely gather consistent data\nbetween flights.\n19\n\nNASA Armstrong Flight Research Center\n\nSummer 2015\n\nNicole Gillian\nThe Art Institute of California \xe2\x80\x93 Orange County\n\nAerospace Education Research\nOperations (AERO) Associates\nUndergraduate Intern\nPhotography\n\nMentor: Jim Ross\nCode: MI\nInformation Systems\n\nPhotography Documentation of Aerospace Engineering\nIn the Photo Lab at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration\n(NASA) Armstrong Flight Research Center, I am learning progressive\nphotography methods for documentation of aerospace engineering research.\nOur primary goal is to document data on all aircraft when needed. It is critical\nto get every shot for the crew of the aircraft, so the engineers can make the\nright corrections. My role as an intern is to help see all of the photos we need\nto document. The photo reflectors indoors, make sure our shutter speed,\naperture, and International Organization of Standardization (ISO) are all\ncorrect for the right white balance. Our first project was photographing all of\nthe interns for their abstract photo by working with soft boxes in the lab. One\nproject we have shot a few times, now, is the Prandtl. Documenting the\nPrandtl was a challenge of panning, zooming, focusing on the plane, and\nkeeping it in frame. Another project in the works is Viper; many engine tests\nhave been in process solving in flight air changes. We photograph many\ndifferent parts of the wings and engine on Viper. I am assisting one of my\nmentors on a shoot of the X-34 Advanced Technology Demonstrator , which\nhas not moved in 15 years, to see if the spacecraft is salvageable.

Because of this, the Industrial Hygiene department\nworks to protect Armstrong Flight Research Center (AFRC) employees from\nhazards such as elevated noise, chemical, or laser exposure, as well as poor\nergonomic workstations that contribute to musculoskeletal diseases. This\nsummer, I have two primary focuses: evaluating and advising employees on\nproper ergonomic workstations, and the consolidation and organization of\ndata from noise surveys collected over the last fifteen years to create a map\nof measured areas. Industrial Hygiene, however, is just one part of the team\nthat helps to support the facility and its mission by supporting the workers.\nWith the guidance and influence of individuals in the Health Unit, Equal\nOpportunity Office, and the Employee Assistance Program, I have created a\nsurvey to evaluate what type of health problems (physical, mental, or social)\nAFRC employees face. With this information, a program can then be\ndesigned to address the needs of our employees to help them be most\nefficient in their work. For example, this information can determine if\ntobacco cessation workshops would be beneficial for Armstrong employees.\n21\n\nNASA Armstrong Flight Research Center\n\nSummer 2015\n\nJames Hamory\nThe Master\xe2\x80\x99s College\n\nAerospace Education Research\nOperations (AERO) Associates\nHigh School Graduate\nCommunications- Electronic\nMedia\n\nMentor: Lori Losey\nCode: MI\nInformation Systems\n\nTastes Like Videography\nDuring my time at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)\nArmstrong Flight Research Center (AFRC), I will be able to discover many\ncomponents of a video department and establish for myself a foundation upon which I\ncan build my career. I will be exposed to the many different aspects of the department\nand become part of the working team for several projects. For example, I will be\nworking behind the scenes to run the weekly Brown Bag Seminars. I will be operating\ncameras, working the sound board, setting up microphones, making adjustments to the\nlighting, producing the live stream, directing the control room, and other necessary\ntasks. This is one of the more exciting parts of my summer job, and I look forward to\ndoing what needs to be done to make each seminar a success.\nOne of the more menial tasks I have this summer is to digitize old footage of NASA\nprojects and seminars, and produce DVDs equipped with closed captions. I will be\naiding in the process of ingesting the film archive to a new and modern platform. This\nprocess involves borrowing tapes from the tape libraries, making digital copies of the\nold footage, ordering transcripts of the videos to make closed captions, saving the files\non the server, and burning new DVDs. This project contributes to the NASA mission\nof innovation and improvement for the future, as digitizing old footage preserves the\ndocumentation of NASA accomplishments and keeps AFRC up to date with modern\ntechnology.\nThis internship gives me the opportunity to shadow the department videographers and\nwitness firsthand what a career in the video field entails. I also get to be a\nvideographer myself as we film and document the Prandtl project that some of the\nother interns are working on. These experiences will benefit me greatly as I begin to\npursue a career in this field.\n22\n\nNASA Armstrong Flight Research Center\n\nSummer 2015\n\nNicholas Horn\nThe Ohio State University\n\nAerospace Education Research\nOperations (AERO) Associates\nUndergraduate Intern\nAerospace Engineering\n\nMentor: Josu\xc3\xa9 Cruz\nCode: RS\nAerostructures Branch\n\nStructural Loads Analysis for ACTE using Tecplot and Matlab\nThe Adaptive Compliant Trailing Edge (ACTE) project modified a\nGulfstream III (G-III) aircraft with a new flexible flap that creates a seamless\ntransition between the flap and the wing. As with any new modification, it is\ncrucial to ensure that the aircraft will not become overstressed in flight. To\ntest this, StarCCM \xe2\x80\x93 a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software\nprogram \xe2\x80\x93 was used to calculate aerodynamic data for the aircraft at given\nflight conditions. The CFD model contains node and pressure coefficient\n(CP) data for thousands of panels, which combine to make up the G-III\naircraft\xe2\x80\x99s surface. My project was to take this data, formatted as a Tecplot (a\npost-processing tool) file, and conduct a loads analysis for the aircraft. The\nproject provided the team with the necessary tools to prove that the aircraft\ncan operate safely within all areas of the flight envelope. To do this, I used\nTecplot\xe2\x80\x99s built-in functions to find the area, center, and normal vector for\neach panel. The data was saved, along with each panel\xe2\x80\x99s CP, to a text file.\nNext, my Matlab script loaded the file, scaled and translated the data\nappropriately, and calculated the aerodynamic loads on the aircraft. Finally,\nthe inertial loads were calculated and added to give the total load, which is\ncompared with actual flight data taken on the aircraft.\n23\n\nNASA Armstrong Flight Research Center\n\nSummer 2015\n\nJohn Jackson\nUniversity of Minnesota, Twin Cities\n\nAerospace Education Research\nOperations (AERO) Associates\nUndergraduate Intern\nAerospace Engineering\nand Mechanics\n\nMentor: Tim Cox\nCode: RC\nControls and Dynamics\n\nsUAS Vibration Isolation\nHugh is a small unmanned aerial system (sUAS) operated by the NASA\nArmstrong Control and Dynamics Research Group, used for flight dynamics\nresearch. Hugh was built by the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities\xe2\x80\x99 UAV\nLaboratory and delivered to Armstrong in 2014, with 13 flights performed as\nof July 2015. The primary research goal of these flights is to collect data to\nperform a parameter identification (PID) method to characterize the\naerodynamic behavior of the aircraft. In order to collect satisfactory data, the\nvibration of the motor needs to be minimized to prevent noise in the axial\nacceleration data. Previous work revealed that the aircraft\xe2\x80\x99s structural modes\nwere being excited at a range of frequencies, from 48Hz to 190Hz, that\ncorrelated to the throttle command of the motor. The approaches for isolating\nthese frequencies include installing rubber seals between the motor mount\nand the firewall, utilizing a triple-propeller assembly instead of a doublepropeller assembly, and redesigning the motor mount. Hugh will be tested on\nthe ground and in flight in order to determine the effectiveness of these\nmethods.\n\n24\n\nNASA Armstrong Flight Research Center\n\nSummer 2015\n\nSaba Janamian\nCalifornia State University Northridge\n\nAerospace Education Research\nOperations (AERO) Associates\nUndergraduate Intern\nElectrical Engineering\nComputer Science\n\nMentors:\nJeanette Le, Ting Tseng, Jeffrey\nNelms, Matthew Reaves, Matthew\nEnga\nCode: RE\n\nEnvironmental Test Procedure for X-5000 Data Processor\nThe equipment used in any flight-vehicle system needs to be\nenvironmentally tested in order to ensure its survivability in the flightoperational environment. The purpose of this project is to develop an\nenvironmental test procedure for the X-5000 data processor. The X-5000\ndecommutator (decom) is a part of SOFIA instrumentation equipment and is\nused to process and decode data stream received from the data acquisition\nunits (DAU). The processed data can be used for on-board, real-time data\nmonitoring. The environmental test consists of thermal/altitude and random\nvibration tests. The thermal/altitude test is performed in a range of 0\nFahrenheit degrees to 160 Fahrenheit degrees, with the equivalent\noperational altitude condition of 17,000 ft (with the device powered on) and\n50,000 ft (with the device powered off). The random vibration test is\nperformed on all three axes according to Curve PA of document DCP-O-018\nwith the device powered on and connected to an in situ workstation with\nOMEGA NExT software for live monitoring of the performance.\n\n25\n\nNASA Armstrong Flight Research Center\n\nSummer 2015\nVictoria Jenne1\nAntelope Valley College\n\nEmma Ruano2\nBakersfield College\n\nLynn Valkov3\nTemple City High School\n\nAerospace Education Research Operations (AERO) Associates\nUndergraduate Intern1,2\nHigh School Student Intern3\nAstrobiology1\nMechanical Engineering2,3\n\nMentor: Albion Bowers & Oscar Murillo\nCode: R\nResearch and Engineering Directorate\n\nMoments of Inertia Testing for PRANDTL-3\nThe primary purpose of Primary Research Aerodynamic Design to\nLower Drag (PRANDTL) is to achieve and research the bell-shaped lift\ndistribution produced in flight. Prior to flight testing, however, the glider\nitself must pass a number tests to produce variables which are essential\nfor data analysis. One of the most imperative tests conducted before\nflight is the Moments of Inertia test, or MOI. Testing to find the glider\xe2\x80\x99s\ntendency to resist angular acceleration, a structure intended to have the\ndimensions 15x15x15 ft will fit the 25-ft wingspan. The MOI Testing\nwill conduct three tests to find the variables for roll, pitch, and yaw.\nPrimarily, the MOI testing will help determine how fast the plane will\nturn with the given elevon deflection. The calculations from the testing\nwill also determine the angles necessary to be applied to the ailerons, in\norder to turn at a desired rate. Performing these tests and using the data\nwill allow us to further analyze the data collected from the flight-tests\nthemselves.\n26\n\nNASA Armstrong Flight Research Center\n\nSummer 2015\n\nRobert Kotcher\nCarnegie Mellon\n\nAerospace Education Research\nOperations (AERO) Associates\nGraduate Intern\nComputer Science\n\nMentor: Ricardo\nCode: RD\nElectronic Instruments\nSystems Branch\n\nStructural Loads GDL88 Installation onto the NASA GlobalHawk UAV\nThe National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is currently\nworking to prepare the Global Hawk unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) for a\nvariety of missions with an objective of surveying hurricanes and collecting\ndata for science experiments. The UAS in the NAS program, a joint effort\nbetween NASA and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), has the\nobjective to develop technologies that will allow UAVs to safely be\nintegrated into the U.S. airspace. One way in which Armstrong Flight\nResearch Center has been involved with the UAS in the NAS program is\nthrough the development of sense and avoid software that can receive and\nmanage data from automatic dependent surveillance broadcast (ADSB )\nsystems. ADSB is an important surveillance technology that must be\nintegrated onto all aircraft in the U.S airspace by 2020, and the Global Hawk\nis hoping to get a head start with the technology. My objective is to help\nintegrate ADSB onto the Global Hawk network, ultimately allowing the data\nto be read by software developed at Armstrong Flight Research Center. My\nwork involves choosing and installing network devices so that data can be\ntransmitted safely and efficiently through the Global Hawk network.\nAdditionally, I am updating the software to talk to the new devices.\n27\n\nNASA Armstrong Flight Research Center\n\nSummer 2015\n\nCaleb Lloyd1\nGeorgia State University\n\nLoren Newton2\nThe University of California\n\nKurt Pauer3\nFresno State University\nUndergraduate\nInterns\nPhysics1\nMechanical\nEngineering2,3\n\nMentor: Albion Bowers\nCode: R\nResearch and\nEngineering\nDirectorate\n\nAerospace Education Research Operations (AERO) Associates1,3\nCalifornia Space Grant Consortium CaSGC2\n\nData Analysis of PRANDTL-D Aircraft\nThe overall goal of the PRANDTL-D project is to construct and evaluate, via\nflight-test, scale flying wings to prove the validity of bell-shaped lift\ndistributions, proverse yaw, and rudderless flight. This manifestation of the\nPRANDTL-D project seeks to analyze flight-test data so as to determine the\naerodynamic coefficients of the PRANDTL-2 aircraft. Utilizing NASA\nArmstrong\xe2\x80\x99s parameter estimation (pEst) MATLAB program with flight data\nand calculated moment of inertia values as inputs, the aerodynamic coefficients\nof the aircraft can be determined. This task is of utmost importance to the\noverall goals of the project, as the coefficients to be calculated can model the\nflight characteristics of the PRANDTL wing. Specifically, a positive\ncoefficient of yaw due to aileron deflection (Cn\xce\xb4a) will prove the existence of\nproverse yaw, a fundamental design objective of the PRANDTL program. By\nthe time the PRANDTL-D project is completed, many aspects of aerodynamics\nand flight-testing, including data collection, aerodynamic coefficient\ndetermination, and lift distribution, will have been explored and considered.\nThrough flight analysis, the truly revolutionary nature of the PRANDTL wing\ncan ultimately be quantifiably communicated.\n28\n\nNASA Armstrong Flight Research Center\n\nSummer 2015\n\nJonathan Lokos\nCal Poly San Luis Obispo\n\nAerospace Education Research\nOperations (AERO) Associates\nHigh School Graduate\nMechanical\nEngineering\n\nAllen Parker\nRD\nElectronic Instruments\nSystems\n\nRapid Prototyping\nRapid prototyping is the process by which Computer Aided Design (CAD)\nsoftware and 3D printing are used to facilitate the early development process\nof a new design or idea. By using the rapid prototyping process, many\npotential problems can be identified and eliminated before any real materials\nor funds are expended. One commonly used CAD software is Solidworks by\nDassault Systems. Solidworks is a sketch-based design software in which a\nsolid 3D model is made by drafting a 2D sketch that is then extruded to\ncreate a solid, 3D object. Solidworks models are then saved as .SLDPRT\nfiles that can be converted to .STL files for use in a 3D printer. This summer,\nSolidworks were used to design several enclosures that contain various\ncontrol components for fiber optic instruments. One such enclosure was\ncompletely self-contained, housing such components as the power supply, IMONS interrogator, fiber optic laser, and cooling fan. Solidworks were\nthen used to determine the most efficient and ergonomic way for these\ncomponents to be arranged inside the enclosure. Various internal brackets\nand spacers were then manufactured using a 3D printer. Rapid prototyping\nhas allowed these enclosures to be created entirely in 3D before a single hole\nwas drilled saving both time and expense.\n29\n\nNASA Armstrong Flight Research Center\n\nSummer 2015\n\nEmily Nichols\nGonzaga University\n\nAerospace Educated Research\nOperations (AERO) Associates\nUndergraduate Intern\nSociology, Business\n\nMentor: Charles Irving\nCode: PS\nScience Mission Directorate\n\nProject Management for Armstrong Airborne Science Platforms\nThe major focus areas of NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Earth Sciences Division (ESD) include\nclimate change, severe weather, the atmosphere, the oceans, sea ice and\nglaciers, and land surface.

In addition,\nthe TAIPS collects imager data from the TA, archives the data, and\ndistributes the data to mission workstations. My project addresses an\noverheating issue on the DAS chassis, which if not solved appropriately, can\nbring the system down in the middle of a flight leading to a reboot, and thus\nloss of significant time for science observation.\nThe proposed solution is an incremental, 3-stage design where subsequent\nstages can be implemented only as needed. The first stage is to attach heat\nfins on the hotspot. If that is not sufficient, then the second stage is to attach\na fan on top of the heat fins. If the hotspot still remains, a heat pipe system\ntravelling from the hotspot to the front of the chassis will be imbedded into\nthe heat fins as the last resort. If this cooling method produces ideal results,\nthen it will also be implemented on PIS and TAIPS.\n31\n\nNASA Armstrong Flight Research Center\n\nSummer 2015\n\nChristian Pereira\nCal Poly Pomona\n\nAerospace Education Research\nOperations (AERO) Associates\nUndergraduate Intern\nMajor: Manufacturing\nEngineering\n\nMentor: Joseph Gonzales\nCode: OE\nOperations\n\nF-15D Test Bed Development\nWith the retirement of tail number 836 \xe2\x80\x93 NASA Armstrong\xe2\x80\x99s modified F15B aircraft \xe2\x80\x93 a newer model F-15D will serve as an aeronautics research\ntest bed as well as a support aircraft.

The 747 airplane model\nwas compared to other airplane models to determine how other vehicle\nsimulators replicated forces acting on the aircraft while in contact with the\nground. Simulation engineers were approached with questions about the\nsimulation to identify the changes that were most needed. Ground maneuver\ntests were performed using the 747 airplane coresim to measure stability and\nperformance quality before and after solutions were applied. The primary\nissue with the 747 airplane gear model was that when the vehicle was at rest,\nit had a net forward velocity at all times. Secondary issues included adding\nmore customization to the landing gear model. Other gear models, including\nthose from the G-III and F-18 airplanes, were analyzed for options available\nto users. After applying fixes to the Strut object code model, the idle velocity\nwas reduced by nearly 100 percent. There is now the option to choose the\nkind of landing gear for each strut. The current options are nose wheel,\nbraking wheel, and skid; more options can be added as functions in the Strut\nobject model.

Until recently,\nhowever, it has been incredibly difficult to get a real-time, accurate estimate\nof the wing shape during flight. With the advancements in the Fiber Optic\nSensing System (FOSS), there have been great strides in achieving precise\nand distributed strain measurements in real-time on an aircraft. The aircraft\nused for this project (APV3) is a UAV lined with approximately 2000 fiber\noptic strain gauges, as well as 44 segmented control surfaces along the\ntrailing edge. Using the displacement transfer function developed at\nArmstrong Flight Research Center, it is relatively simple to convert the\ndistributed strain readings into an estimate of the wing shape. Once the shape\nis determined, it is possible to use the segmented trailing edge to redistribute\nload inboard or outboard in order to reduce bending stresses or increase the\nefficiency of the aircraft. The redistribution of load could lead to the\nreduction of support structure in aircraft, which would result in reducing\nweight. As weight is reduced, so is fuel cost, saving money and the\nenvironment. The FOSS has widespread applications with opportunities to\nmake huge impacts on flight and in other areas. Controlling wing shape will\nbe essential for future aircraft and this project is one of the first steps in\ndetermining the best methods.\n39\n\nNASA Armstrong Flight Research Center\n\nSummer 2015\n\nKyler Stephens\nGeorge Fox University\n\nAerospace Education Research\nOperations (AERO) Associates\nUndergraduate Intern\nElectrical Engineering\n\nMentor: Allen Parker\nCode: RD\nElectronic Instruments\nSystems Branch\n\nLiquid Metal Strain Gage Digital Signal Conditioning Development\nI, along with Logan Francisco, another AERO Intern, have been tasked with\nbuilding an interrogation unit that will acquire and store the data generated\nfrom experiments in the Fiber Optics Laboratory.

An\nLMSG is a device used for measuring strain on highly elastic materials.\nEach LMSGs acquisition board consist of three A/Ds (analog-to-digital\nconverters), two D/As (digital-to-analog converters), and a microcontroller.\nUsing Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI), the microcontroller will read the data\nfrom the A/Ds and D/As and then send the data to the Raspberry Pi using\nI2C. The microcontroller will also write instructions to the A/Ds and D/As.\nBecause of the wireless capabilities of the Raspberry Pi, this unit will be able\nto function in any location where there is a wireless Internet connection. If\nthere is no wireless Internet connection, our unit can function in an alternate\nmode: the LMSGs can be directly plugged into a PC via USB and run with\nthe PC being the \xe2\x80\x9cbrains.\xe2\x80\x9d The purpose of our experiment is to provide an\neasier and more convenient way to collect and log data from LMSGs.\n40\n\nNASA Armstrong Flight Research Center\n\nSummer 2015\n\nEthan Williams\nCalifornia State University Long Beach\n\nAerospace Education Research\nOperations (AERO) Associates\nUndergraduate Intern\nElectrical Engineering\n\nMentor: Mark Skoog\nCode: Z\nReimbursable Project Office\n\nEvaluating Improved Ground Collision Avoidance Software at Oshkosh\nAirshow\nControlled flight into terrain (CFIT) is defined as an accident in which an\nairworthy aircraft, under pilot control, is unintentionally flown into the\nground, a mountain, a body of water, or an obstacle. The CFIT accidents are\none of the major causes of fatalities in general aviation. iGCAS is a suite of\nsoftware that aims to eliminate CFIT accidents in general aviation, having\norigins beginning around 30 years ago with the AFTI F-16 aircraft. The\nground collision avoidance algorithm that was written and developed on the\nAFTI F-16 has been adapted to run on a cell phone. Last summer, I, along\nwith a team of interns, developed an improved pilot-vehicle interface to\nbetter convey the information that the algorithm is wishing to convey to the\npilot. This summer, my team and I have been preparing to evaluate the\neffectiveness of the cell phone application. We have found that the pool of\ntest pilots available to us is unsuitable to evaluate the effectiveness of the\nsoftware. We have decided to conduct a large pilot evaluation at the\nOshkosh Airshow, which has a sufficient amount of general aviation pilots. I\nhave been preparing to ship the entire simulator evaluation set up to\nWisconsin, and preparing the test environment to ensure that the trip is\nsuccessful.\n41\n\nMadison Washburn\nBrigham Young University\n\nAerospace Education Research\nOperations (AERO) Associates\nUndergraduate Intern\nElementary Education\n\nMentor: Kirsten Fogg\nCode: K\nOffice of Education\n\nEducating the Community through Science, Technology, Engineering, and\nMathematics (STEM) Workshops\nThe NASA strategic objective for Education is to \xe2\x80\x9cAdvance the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s\nScience, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) education and\nworkforce pipeline by working collaboratively with other agencies to engage\nstudents, teachers, and faculty in NASA\xe2\x80\x99s missions and unique assets.\xe2\x80\x9d The\nNASA Armstrong Flight Research Center Office of Education is committed\nto this objective by delivering effective STEM education that provides\nopportunities for participatory and experiential learning activities in formal\nand informal settings to connect learners to NASA-unique resources.

This is achieved by integrating fiber optic cables into a wide\nvariety of systems. The FOSS team has developed and continues to develop\na variety of sensing systems which involve numerous electronic components.\nIn the past, the FOSS team has had to purchase prebuilt enclosures that are\neither too big, too small, or too heavy to use for testing functions. The\npurpose of my internship is to design enclosures for a number of sensing\nsystems and their subcomponents, and to bring all of the components for\neach system together into compact, lightweight, low-cost, practical\nfunctioning units.

We are currently using APV-3 as the test\nairplane for our research; the FOSS system we have applied uses over 2000\nfiber optic strain sensors on both wings. The method that is currently in use\nis having a flat plate with FOSS, in which we place a load on the wing. With\nthe use of LabVIEW we are able to create a program that will show us where\nthe bending and twist is being applied, due to the load. By having these\nresults we will be able to move the load inward toward the root, due to it\nbeing the strongest point of the wing to reduce the strain, while also being\nable to determine the bending and the twist for real-time shape. We will\nconclude by moving the load inward, giving a better flight so the wings can\nstay stronger and will not be as heavy throughout the flight.\n\n44\n\nNASA Armstrong Flight Research Center\n\nSummer 2015\n\nKevin Collins\nCalifornia State University, San Bernardino\n\nCurriculum Improvements\nPartnership Award for the\nIntegration of Research (CIPAIR)\nUndergraduate Intern\nPhysics\n\nMentor: Kurt Kloesel\nCode: Rt\nVehicle Integration & Test\n\nAn Investigation of Digitally Controlled AC to DC Converters\nElectronics are powered by direct current (DC), but the power delivered by\npower generators is alternating current (AC), therefore an AC to DC\nconverter must be employed. The most common type of convert is an\nuncontrolled rectifier circuit (URC), which make use of diodes and other\npassive elements to redirect current into one direction. While URCs are\neffective and have seen wide use in industry, they suffer from less-than\ndesirable efficiency and are unable to dynamically vary their output voltage\nwithout additional components. A controlled rectifier circuit (CRC), on the\nother hand, uses a digital processor to open and close transistor switches. By\nopening the appropriate set of switches at the correct time the path that the\ncurrent takes can be manipulated to flow in one direction. Controlled\nrectifier circuits have greater efficiency than URCs, are able to dynamically\nvary the amplitude of their output voltage, and can be used as both AC to DC\nand DC to AC converters. The unique ability to be used as bidirectional\nconverter has led to an increased interest of CRCs and their application to\nhybrid electric vehicles. For these reasons we construct a CRC and test its\nbidirectional properties.\n45\n\nNASA Armstrong Flight Research Center\n\nSummer 2015\n\nJoseph Martinez\nCalifornia State University, San Bernardino\n\nCurriculum Improvements\nPartnership Award for the\nIntegration of Research (CIPAIR)\nUndergraduate Intern\nPhysics\n\nMentor: Yohan Lin\nCode: RT\nVehicle Integration and Test\n\n3D Electromagnetic Modeling of a High Performance 15kW PMSM Motor\nSimulation software can be a useful tool when trying to identify\ncharacteristics of a system without the need to physically manufacture\nanything. To do this, a 3D model of the system is created, and specific\nphysical constraints are defined. Once the model is created, it can be run in a\nsimulation software, and properties of the system can be calculated. Using\nthese techniques, an electromagnetic characterization on permanent magnet\nsynchronous motors can be done to obtain knowledge of various properties\nof the motor. An important area of interest is in the analysis of the\nelectromotive force that opposes the current traveling through the coil loop\n(back e.m.f ) of an electric motor caused by the spinning magnets in the\nrotor; it can be thought of as a kind of natural brake in the motor. During the\ncycle of an electric motor, there are moments when a coil does not have a\ncurrent flowing through it from the controller, however, the back EMF still\nhas its effect and produces a current in the coil. During this moment in time\nthe current can be measured using that back EMF, and it can be deduced\nwhat the speed of the motor is, thus eliminating the need of a sensor and\nallowing for better control of a motor drive system.\n46\n\nNASA Armstrong Flight Research Center\n\nSummer 2015\n\nAna Escalera1\nAntelope Valley College\n\nWill Morris2\nCal Poly Pomona\n\nRaziq Noorali3\nCollege of the Desert\n\nJoseph Piotrowski4\nCal State Long Beach\n\nUniversities Space Research Association (USRA)1,2,4\nCurriculum Improvements Partnership Award for the Integration of\nResearch (CIPAIR)3\nUndergraduate Interns\nElectrical Engineering1\nCivil Engineering2\nPhysics3\nMechanical Engineering4\n\nMentors: Dave Berger, Al Bowers, Kirsten Fogg\nProfessors: Dr. Sim, Dr. Rubayi, Dr. Bowen\nCode: R\nEngineering and Research Directorate\n\nAtmospheric Characterization on the Surface of Mars\nThe Primary Research Aerodynamic Design to Land on Mars (PRANDTL-M)\nflying wing is a prototype of an unmanned glider with the possibility of being sent\nto gather extraterrestrial data. Potential mission goals include mapping out a\nproposed landing site for the human exploration of Mars, and geological mapping\nof Valles Marineris. Considerable terrestrial testing is required to develop the\nPRANDTL-M, which will be rolled up into a 3U CubeSat module. Many\natmospheric sensors will be required to meet the prototyping and development\ndemands of this project.

The design involves partitioning the\nactuators of an aircraft so that some are used with an existing nonadaptive\ncontrol law, and the rest are utilized by an adaptive control law to jointly\ncontrol the vehicle. The partitioning ensures that operation of the\nnonadpative law is minimally disturbed, and that the ability to turn off the\nadaptive law is preserved. The partitioning also facilitates the problem being\nrestated as a shifted version of the model reference adaptive control problem\n(MRAC). However, a longstanding limitation of MRAC is that it cannot be\napplied to nonminimum phase systems. Since aircraft models are frequently\nnonminimum phase, the traditional MRAC scheme must be altered to\naccommodate them. In the current work a new version of the MRAC scheme\nappropriate for nonminimum phase systems is presented. This version only\nrequires that estimates of the unstable zeros be available for implementation\nand still provides reasonably bounded output tracking error. The\nperformance of the proposed design for both flutter suppression and\ncommand tracking is demonstrated in simulation using various aircraft\nmodels.\n48\n\nNASA Armstrong Flight Research Center\n\nSummer 2015\n\nKeenan Albee1\nColumbia University\n\nJonathan Zur2\nUniversity of Illinois\nUndergraduate Interns\nMechanical\nEngineering1\nAerospace\nEngineering2\n\nMentor: Albion\nBowers, Oscar\nMurillo\nCode: R\n\nMultidisciplinary Aeronautics Research Team Initiative (MARTI)\n\nAnalysis of PRANDTL 2 Flight Data\nThe Prandtl-II aircraft is an experimental glider in the Prandtl-D program.\nDuring the summer of 2015, the team performed several data collection\nflights with this aircraft and observed the ability of the aircraft to achieve\nproverse yaw. Data from these flights was then analyzed in order to obtain\nthe aerodynamic coefficients necessary to study the flight of the aircraft in\ndepth. Specifically, finding the yaw moment due to elevon deflection\nallowed the team to document the presence of proverse yaw during flight.\nFinding most of the coefficients required the use of parameter estimation\n(pEst). The team used the pEst program in order to relate the controller input\nduring a maneuver with the response of the aircraft. The pEst program\nanalyzes the oscillating motion of the aircraft after a maneuver and then\nattempts to recreate the time history by approximating the aerodynamic\ncoefficients. Through pEst, the data collected during such maneuvers was\nused to determine the aerodynamic parameters of the glider.\n\n49\n\nNASA Armstrong Flight Research Center\n\nSummer 2015\n\nKira Headrick\nHarvard University\n\nMultidisciplinary Aeronautics\nResearch Team Initiative (MARTI)\nUndergraduate Intern\nMechanical Engineering\n\nMentor: Francisco Pena\nCode: RS\nAerostructures\n\nOptimizing Lift in Deformable Wings Using Strain Sensing in Small Aerial\nVehicles\nMy project group is working to interpret data from a Fiber Optic Sensing\nSystem (FOSS) measuring strain on the wings of an Unmanned Aerial\nVehicle (UAV), and using this information to modify the wing\xe2\x80\x99s shape. The\nUAV being used is the APV 3 aircraft, the wings of which contain over 2000\nstrain sensors and 44 independently controlled flaps located along the trailing\nedges. The objective of this project is to deflect the flaps to redistribute the\nlifting load inward toward the fuselage of the aircraft during both, high-G\nmaneuvers and steady-level flight. This would improve efficiency, gust\nmitigation, and the reduction of moment along the wing. With a working\nsystem, the wing could be built with less weight, thereby saving material and\nfuel. Code will be written for the flaps to conform to this lift distribution, the\nsystem will be tested in the air in late July, and analysis will be performed to\ndetermine whether the moment along the wing was reduced when the system\nwas in use. If the moment along the wing was reduced, this would indicate an\neffective algorithm, and indicate that controllable flaps can usefully\nredistribute lift. With less moment necessary in the wings of an aircraft to\ncomplete a specified maneuver, an equally capable aircraft can be built with\nlighter, more deformable wings.\n50\n\nNASA Armstrong Flight Research Center\n\nSummer 2015\n\nClement Li\nPrinceton University\n\nMultidisciplinary Aeronautics\nResearch Team Initiative (MARTI)\nUndergraduate Intern\nMechanical and Aerospace\nEngineering\n\nMentor: Frank Pena\nCode: RS\nAero Structures Branch\n\nDevelopment and Evaluation of Feedback Control Systems Using\nSegmented Control Surfaces and Fiber Optic Sensing System\nThe Fiber Optic Sensing System (FOSS) consists of Fiber Bragg Gratings\nthat allow for a large quantity of strain sensors to be embedded into a wing at\na low weight cost, enabling structural health monitoring of the entire wing.\nThe employment of many segmented control surfaces across the entire span\nof the wing, however, extends the capabilities of FOSS into the realm of\nactively shaping the lift distribution. By shifting the lift distribution inboard,\nit is possible to reduce the bending moment on the wingbox, while\nmaintaining a constant total lift. The feedback control system integrating\nFOSS data with the actuation of the segmented control surfaces is currently\nbeing developed, with multiple control schemes being investigated. In\naddition to targeting a reference root strain, a control system targeting tip\ndeflection, and eventually tailoring the entire lift distribution, will be\ndeveloped and flown for evaluation on the small, unmanned APV-3. The\ncontrol systems will be investigated for the capability to automatically\nredistribute lift and reduce structural loads during maneuvers with increased\nwing loadings, as well as for gust alleviation.\n51\n\nNASA Armstrong Flight Research Center\n\nSummer 2015\n\nKassidy McLaughlin1\nCalifornia State University at Long Beach\n\nAlexandra Ocasio2\nUniversity of Puerto Rico at Mayaguez\nUndergraduate\nInterns\nMechanical\nEngineering\n\nMentor: Oscar Murillo\n& Al Bowers\nCode: R\nEngineering and\nResearch Directorate\n\nUniversities Space Research Association (USRA)1\nMultidisciplinary Aeronautics Research Team Initiative (MARTI)2\n\nPrandtl-D Flight Testing and Operations\nFlight testing is an integral part of the National Aeronautics and Space\nAdministration (NASA) Armstrong Flight Research Center operations and\ncontinues to grow tremendously with a variety of upcoming projects. The\nPrimary Research AerodyNamic Design To Lower Drag (PRANDTL-D)\nseeks to overcome adverse yaw effects by using a non-linear aerodynamic\ntwist. Proverse yaw, the tendency for an aircraft to roll and yaw in the same\ndirection, is possible with the PRANDTL-D distinctive wing shape, lift\ndistribution, and lack of a vertical tail. A PRANDTL-D type vehicle will\nsignificantly reduce drag and weight from the aircraft, therefore making\nworldwide green aviation goals attainable. In order to demonstrate these\neffects, accurate data must be recorded by performing roll and pitch doublet\nmaneuvers on the aircraft. Instrumentation on the aircraft gathered data of\ninterest during scheduled flights. Individuals within the flight-testing group\nwere assigned roles to oversee flight procedures, aircraft testing, and data\nmanagement. Briefings were conducted in order to maintain proper\ncommunication and ensure the airworthiness of the aircraft. With the data\ncollected from each scheduled flight and with further research in this ground\nbreaking discovery, we hope to be able to influence the future of aviation.\n.\n\n52\n\nNASA Armstrong Flight Research Center\n\nSummer 2015\n\nChristopher Trumbull\nUtah State University\n\nMultidisciplinary Aeronautics\nResearch Team Initiative (MARTI)\nProfessional Intern\nMechanical Engineering with\nan emphasis in Aerospace\nEngineering\n\nMentor: Francisco Pe\xc3\xb1a\nCode: RS\nAerostructures\n\nControlling Wing Deformation In-flight Using Adaptive Control Surfaces\nAlong Trailing Edge\nEnhancing the wing shape of an aircraft provides essential flight\ncharacteristics to distribute the aerodynamic load more efficiently. Currently,\nhowever, it has been challenging to monitor the real-time shape of the wing\nduring flight. The NASA Armstrong Flight Research Center developed a\nfiber-optic sensing system (FOSS) that is lightweight and capable of making a\nmultitude of distributed strain measurements on aerospace structures in real\ntime. The aircraft being used for this project is an Autonomous Piloted\nVehicle 3 (APV3) with approximately 2000 fiber-optic strain sensors along\nthe wingspan, and 44 segmented control surfaces along the trailing edge. The\ninfluences of the FOSS strain measurements can be used to determine the\ndeformation of the wing during flight. Ultimately, when the shape is\ndetermined, APV3 will be able to control the trailing edge positions and thus\nredistribute the load to a more favorable configuration, reducing the bending\nstresses along the wing and increasing the performance of the aircraft. In\naddition, monitoring real-time shape would allow a reduction of structure\nsupport in the aircraft, minimizing weight and therefore the amount of fuel\ncarried. The research being tested on APV3 is a step toward improving the\nfuture of the environment and of efficient flight.\n53\n\nNASA Armstrong Flight Research Center\n\nSummer 2015\n\nKaixi Wang\nUniversity of Texas at Austin\n\nMultidisciplinary Aerospace\nResearch Team Initiative (MARTI)\nUndergraduate Intern\nAerospace Engineering\n\nMentor: Oscar Murillo\nCode: R\nEngineering and Research\nDirectorate\n\nAnalysis of Steven Portugal\xe2\x80\x99s Ibis Formation Flight Data and Application\nto PRANDTL Aircraft\nMany species of birds travel in distinctive \xe2\x80\x9cV\xe2\x80\x9d formations.

However, light is not always shed on these brilliant inventions and\nsome radical innovations never make it to the public sector. In order to make these advanced\ntechnologies readily available for the public use, NASA assembled the Technology Transfer\nteam.

Essentially, we analyze other potential applications that\ninclude wind turbines, animal prosthetics, propellers, automotive spoiler design, new aircraft\ndesign, and retrofit solutions. Our end goal is to advance the development of the Prandtl\nproject through various venues that include gaining exposure to multiple subject matter\nexperts on the technology; being involved in current Prandtl-based projects to deepen our\nunderstanding of the technology; perform strength, weakness, opportunity, and threat\n(SWOT) analysis on the project; conduct market studies on new applications; and apply indepth industry research that provides technical and business possibilities. As well, our\nobjective is to provide a roadmap for commercialization and potential design prototypes\nthrough researching and analyzing key business dimensions for primary identified market\napplications.

The Technology Transfer Office adds significant value to NASA\nby facilitating the patenting process for the benefit of NASA employees. Working as an\nengineering consultant alongside William Alfano, my business teammate, we apply our\ndiverse backgrounds to discover unique and innovative commercial applications and\nopportunities for the transfer of NASA technologies to industry. Working as a team, we\nlook for a wide range of possibilities that these technologies could be used for other than\nthe intended purpose. Our goal is to commercialize government technologies utilizing\nmarket studies to determine where new, more efficient technologies can advance or\nreplace existing technologies currently on the market. Engineering and business skills are\ncombined to analyze strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats on NASA\ninnovations. Our objective is to conduct market studies, study relevant patents, and\nexamine the current and new technology in order to develop a commercialization plan.\nThe Technology Transfer Office uses this plan to pursue product licensing.

The 3DR Pixhawk autopilot open source platform\nserves as the terrestrial control solution using GPS and standard methods. The\nPixhawk will be modified in hardware and software to only include the most\nessential features, to avoid any unnecessary weight, and improve processor\nefficiency. The airspeed indicator, altimeter, gyroscope, GPS, compass, optical\nflow sensor, and accelerometer will gather data to assist in the navigation and\ncontrol of PRANDTL-M. Pixhawk can be programmed and controlled using\nQGroundControl software, where the gain values will be tuned to provide for a\nstable flight-control solution. In addition, X-Plane, a simulation program, is used\nto run a Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) in parallel with QGroundControl to test\nthe inputs and outputs of the system, reducing development time and allowing\nfor first-order testing of new code.

A wake vortex encounter while flying near the wake could be\ndangerous and wake vortices are generally not visible. Automated\nCooperative Trajectory (ACT) control algorithms are being developed and a\nDisplay for Awareness of the Vortex Estimation (DAVE) is necessary for the\npilot to monitor the automated system and display the estimated position\ninformation relative to the vortex. Display development will be\naccomplished on an existing head-down display (HDD) in the SubsoniC\nResearch Aircraft Testbed (SCRAT) piloted simulation. Objects within the\ndisplay will be driven by the control laws to monitor relative position to\ndesired location and vortex proximity. In order to develop wake displays for\nthe pilot, prototypes will be developed within the engineering team and\ndiscussed with pilots for feedback. Several candidate displays will be\ndeveloped and implemented in the SCRAT simulator during which pilot\nevaluations will be collected. Results from this investigation will lead to\nrecommendations for a final display.\n61\n\nNASA Armstrong Flight Research Center\n\nSummer 2015\n\nBenjamin Cobleigh\nUniversity of Arizona\n\nUniversities Space Research\nAssociation (USRA)\nUndergraduate Intern\nBusiness Management/\nEntrepreneurship\n\nMentor: Peggy Hayes\nCode: XP\nProjects\n\nThe Mars Airplane Live Event\nThe Mars Airplane Live event is an event to take place in October at the\nAero Institute. Initially, the event needs to be accepted via proposal by the\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA) for funding. The\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) must also accept\nthe proposition via tactical management board; with both organizations\naccepting the proposal, the event will be allowed to take place. The main\nidea is to create an event to attract the younger audience, as well as be a\nvirtual way to obtain information. The event will star the Primary Research\nAerodynamic Design To Land on Mars (PRANDTL-M), or The Mars\nAirplane, and will show the public what the concept is, what the purpose will\nbe, and how they will obtain their expected outcome. The event will be\nlivestreamed in order to appeal to the youth, as well as complete the task of\ncreating a virtual medium of information. The event will start with Al\nBowers describing the basics of the PRANDTL-M, followed by two interns\nwho will go more in-depth with what they have been doing for the\nadvancement of this project. The event will be advertised via email and\nsocial media, specifically targeting university students as well as young\nprofessionals all over the country. The event\xe2\x80\x99s goal is to provide a high\nenergy, entertaining, interactive event that encourages the youth to join a\nprestigious organization that appeals to their love of all things aero.\n62\n\nNASA Armstrong Flight Research Center\n\nSummer 2015\n\nRheanna Cowee\nSan Diego State University\n\nUniversities Space Research\nAssociation (USRA)\nUndergraduate Intern\nBusiness Human Resources\n\nMentor: Rebecca Flick\nCode: K\nOffice of Education\n\nCoordinating the NASA Armstrong Internship Program\nThe Office of Education at NASA works in unity with various centers and\noffices to provide learners with valuable educational experiences. One goal\nof NASA\xe2\x80\x99s education program is to provide a platform for people of all ages\nto spark an interest in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics\nfields. To provide a meaningful summer internship experience, the student\ncoordinator is responsible for several essential duties that contribute to the\nfunctionality of the program. Some of these tasks include ensuring visit\nrequests are completed properly, assisting in arrival orientation, and\ncoordinating various tours of our center. Lunchtime brown bag seminars,\npresented by NASA employees on a variety of topics relevant to Armstrong\nFlight Research Center, are coordinated by the student coordinator. Briefings\nare hosted to provide guidance on topics including Scientific and Technical\nInformation and Export Control. Students\xe2\x80\x99 preliminary plans, abstracts,\nprofessional posters, and exit presentations are coordinated, approved, and\nproduced through the assistance of the student coordinator. Another aspect of\nthe student coordinator\xe2\x80\x99s job is to evaluate the student intern program and\nreport on student statistics. This includes producing relevant quantitative and\nillustrative documentation to be used in MUREP White House Reports,\nOEPM, Monthly MUREP Agency calls, NIFS biweekly calls, and Center\nCoordinator calls.\n63\n\nNASA Armstrong Flight Research Center\n\nSummer 2015\n\nJohn Freudinger\nCalifornia State University, Long Beach\n\nUniversities Space Research\nAssociation (USRA)\nUndergraduate Intern\nComputer Engineering\n\nMentor: Sam Kim\nCode: RE\nSystems Engineering and\nIntegration\n\nUnmanned Aircraft Systems Integration in the National Airspace System\nRoutine access by unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) in the National Airspace\nSystem (NAS) requires closure of a number of technology gaps. The purpose of\nthe UAS in the NAS project is to help close these gaps by integrating multiple\nsystem components in an operationally relevant test environment. The NASA\nArmstrong Flight Research Center has teamed with the NASA Ames Research\nCenter, the NASA Langley Research Center, the NASA Glenn Research Center,\nand several industry partners to integrate and test the viability of data\ncommunication systems, sense-and-avoid programs, and human systems\nintegration technologies and procedures for autonomous aircraft. Once put into\nsituations that represent real-world scenarios that UAS pilots would encounter in\nthe NAS, these systems are designed to tell a pilot when a possible threat is\napproaching, and suggest a maneuver that will prevent a mid-air collision or other\ncatastrophe that may endanger others in the air or on the ground below. NASA is\nalso using live data to validate results, such as sensor performance and reliability,\nstate data uncertainty, and other results, which were collected in previous tests\nconducted with simulations. The systems are also being tested to examine how\nthey will react when placed in situations in which there are unpredictable factors,\nsuch as wind. Once testing is completed, the results gathered will be used to help\ndevelop the Minimum Operational Performance Standards (MOPS). These MOPS\nwill help develop FAA technical standards and regulatory changes to allow UAS\nto routinely fly in the NAS.\n64\n\nNASA Armstrong Flight Research Center\n\nSummer 2015\n\nPablo J.

Pearson\nCode: ME\nSimulation Engineering\nHardware\n\nImprovement and Testing of Analog to Digital Converters\nThe use of an analog-to-digital (ADC) converter in systems that require the realtime response found in aircraft flight controls must be accurate and reliable to\nensure safety. The ADCs found in the autopilot currently in use by the Prandtl-D\naircraft are part of a critical flight control system that includes elevons, alpha\nvanes, and beta vanes. As these components change their angular position a\ncorresponding change in voltage occurs. This voltage is continuous in time and\nmust be translated into digital binary code for interpretation by the flight control\ncomputer (FCC). The performance of an ADC is predominantly dependent upon its\nresolution and speed. The autopilot currently uses a 16-bit Semtech SX8724C ADC\nthat is working at half its maximum resolution, effectively rendering the precision\nof the ADC over a 2.5V range to 76.29\xc2\xb5V from a theoretical 39.67\xc2\xb5V maximum\nresolution. The objectives are to increase the resolution of the ADC to its maximum\n16-bit capacity and improve system robustness through the design of a printed\ncircuit board compatible with the current autopilot platform. It is important to\nupgrade the resolution of the ADCs with minimal disturbance to other flight\nsystems; in order to accomplish this all final changes will be made using software.\nThe approach is to devise a method of calibrating the ADCs while evaluating\nimportant parameters that include noise and effective resolution. Once a reliable\ntesting and calibration method has been developed for the ADCs the corresponding\nchanges will be made to the flight control software and tested before flight. All\nmethods and procedures will be stored in a database to ensure sustainability.\n65\n\nNASA Armstrong Flight Research Center\n\nSummer 2015\n\nE.

This typically leaves research vehicles in need\nof a secondary data collection system, or \xe2\x80\x9cdata cube.\xe2\x80\x9d One solution to the high-cost,\nproprietary, control-focused commercial solutions is a flight computer, nicknamed\n\xe2\x80\x9cGoldy\xe2\x80\x9d and built by the University of Minnesota. Goldy is an all-inclusive flight\ncontrol system (FCS) with data acquisition, as well as a work in progress.\nThe Goldy FCS came to the NASA Armstrong Flight Research Center with software\nproblems involving memory leaks and data throughput from peripheral sensors \xe2\x80\x93\nspecifically those on the I2C bus. The I2C data throughput problem required both\nhardware and software solutions in the form of a low-impedance circuit, a\nreprogrammed driver for the analog-to-digital converters (ADC) and modifications\nto the data collection functions. The embedded Configurable operating system\n(eCos) buffers data files stored in volatile memory, causing unlinked files to remain\nin memory until a hard reset occurs. The solution to this problem required unmounting and re-mounting the file system as a part of the data logging software\nroutine. The Goldy FCS (serial #002) with updated software has been successfully\nflown on the PRANDTL-2 aircraft and has collected data from almost 30 flights to\ndate. Work still in progress includes adding support for storing data in non-volatile\nmemory and for ADCs that provide for many more (on the order of 50) analog input\nchannels.\n66\n\nNASA Armstrong Flight Research Center\n\nSummer 2015\n\nWaqqas H.

To release\nthe payload, there are different maneuvers being considered that benefit from\nadditional thrust. An onboard hybrid rocket is going to be used to provide\nthis additional thrust. However, to control the rocket, a motor controller is\nneeded that would communicate between the rocket and the ground control\nstation (GCS) via the Piccollo Autopilot . We were able to design the motor\ncontroller using the Code Composer Studio (CCS) for software development\nand Altium Designer for circuit/PCB design. The motor controller was\ndesigned using the Delfino F28335 control card microcontroller. The motor\ncontroller was lab-tested and found to interface smoothly between the GCS\nand the hybrid rocket.\n\n67\n\nNASA Armstrong Flight Research Center\n\nSummer 2015\n\nDavid Kloesel1\nVictor Valley College\n\nMichael Kloesel2\nCalifornia State University,\nSan Bernadino\n\nMandy Ledford3\nVictor Valley College\n\nUniversities Space and\nResearch Association (USRA)\nUndergraduate Interns\nComputer Engineering1\nChemistry2\nComputer Science33\n\nMentors: Dave Berger, Al Bowers, Kirsten Fogg\nProfessors: Dr. Sim, Dr. Rubayi, Dr. Bowen\nCode: R\nEngineering and Research Directorate\n\nPRANDTL-M Point of Interest Mapping\nThe Primary Research Aerodynamic Design To Land on Mars (PRANDTL-M)\nis a robust glider designed for mapping terrain and detecting atmospheric\nproperties from 20,000 feet above ground level (AGL) to the Martian surface.\nThe development of an imaging system with resolution greater than current\nMars and terrestrial satellite resolution is key to the success of the mission. In\nparticular, image processing software is developed to create a post flight\ncomposite point of interest map from which X, Y, and Z dimensions of the\nterrain are extracted. This data will be used to guide mars rover exploration.\nThe imaging system design proceeds in three main development cycles\n(imaging system, airframe integration, and flight testing). Arduino based\ncamera systems are used to create a low cost first order modest resolution\nimaging system. Miniaturization is key because the airframe payload bay is\nless than two inches (span) by eight inches (chord) by half of an inch, and it\nmust include the flight controller, battery system, avionics, and science system.\nThe camera interface is developed on an Arduino Uno and then transitioned to\nan Arduino Mini . This system is then tested for environmental stability, flight\nstability, and on-condition operation.\n68\n\nNASA Armstrong Flight Research Center\n\nSummer 2015\n\nHeather Laffoon\nCalifornia State University, Long Beach\n\nUniversities Space Research\nAssociation (USRA)\nUndergraduate Intern\nAerospace\nEngineering\n\nMentors: Dave Berger, Al Bowers,\nKirsten Fogg\nCode: R\nEngineering and Research\nDirectorate\n\nTesting of PRANDTL-M\nThe purpose of the Primary Research Aerodynamic Design To Land on Mars\n(PRANDTL-M) project is to prove that the flying wing design will work for a\nmission to Mars, to provide better image mapping than satellites, and to collect\ndata for atmospheric characterization. One of the most crucial is environmental\ntesting. The equipment will be placed in environmental chambers which will\nsimulate Martian conditions, and performance parameters, such as power draw\nand sampling rates, will be monitored. There will also be a series of flight tests\nto determine the flight characteristics and stability of the flying wing design.\nFirst, there will be indoor tests, in which several prototype flying wings will be\nthrown by hand or launched using a rubber band system to determine the\nstability of each design and calculate the lift to drag ratio. Next, the prototypes\nwill be loaded with a simple sensing package (an accelerometer, gyroscope,\nand barometer) and will be launched from a building roof. This launch will\nyield data on the aircraft stability and flight characteristics such as roll, pitch,\nand yaw rates. Finally, the full flight system (autopilot, camera, sensing, and\nmapping) will be tested by DROID captive carry tests. The DROID aircraft\nwill carry the glider to approximately 1,000 feet , where it will be released and\nallowed to glide back to the surface. This will verify the integration of the\nsystems with the airframe and prove whether the design is a good concept for a\nMars mission.\n69\n\nNASA Armstrong Flight Research Center\n\nSummer 2015\n\nHarrison Pauer\nUniversity of California, Irvine\n\nUniversities Space Research\nAssociation (USRA)\nUndergraduate Intern\nMechanical Engineering\n\nMentor: John Ruhf\nCode: OE\nOperations Engineering\n\nAssisting and Completing Modifications on SCRAT\nSubsoniC Research Aircraft Testbed (SCRAT) is a modified G-III research\nairplane for NASA Armstrong. SCRAT is currently modified to test Adaptive\nCompliant Trailing Edge (ACTE). ACTE is two modified flaps that have\ntransition surfaces on each side of the flaps; ACTE creates a flap with a\ncontinuous surface. ACTE may allow for a 3-10 percent cruise drag\nreduction, 20 percent wing weight reduction, 4-6 dB noise reduction during\napproach and landing, structural load alleviation, and increased control\nsurface effectiveness. This summer I mainly focused on creating or assisting\nmodifications to SCRAT. I environmentally tested many new aircraft testing\ncomponents including HD Cameras, Heat Controllers, and HDMI Recorders.\nI also created the environmental test plan for SCRAT. I designed a wiring\npass through the pressurized AFT bulkhead for the HDMI Recorders, HD\nCameras, Hydraulic Pressure Transducer, Fuel Flow Meters, and any future\nwiring. I learned about the operation and utility of the laser tracker\nmeasurement system. I was a part of the planning team of a joint acoustics\ntest with Langley and Armstrong personnel on the lakebed. I assisted any\nmember on the SCRAT or ACTE as needed for the remainder of my summer\ninternship.\n70\n\nNASA Armstrong Flight Research Center\n\nSummer 2015\n\nKarter Rohrer\nCalifornia Polytechnic State University\n\nUniversities Space Research\nAssociation (USRA)\nUndergraduate Intern\nComputer Information\nSystems\n\nMentor: Ronald Ray\nCode: RO\nKnowledge Management\n\nDeveloping a Document Naming Schema for Armstrong Flight Research\nCenter\nA document file naming schema is a standardized agreement that applies to all\ndocument types within an organization. In a database, each item is given an\nindex, which allows users to precisely locate a piece of information. In the\npast, a unique naming convention was created specifically for each project at\nthe National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Armstrong Flight\nResearch Center and lacked unified regulation. This problem has led to data\nloss and wasted resources at the center. My summer project is to design and\nimplement a unified naming standard for project data and then identify areas\nwithin test data that could use a similar process. This system will also contain\nmetadata attributes that will assist users in identifying legacy data. The data\nmodels provided as well as past naming conventions serve as a primary\nbaseline for my project. In order to compensate for different databases that\nNASA uses, this program will transfer the middleware portal from the\nStratospheric Observatory For Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA) to a generic\nversion, applying additional features that will aid in search capabilities. A\nprimary focus is to identify all of the possible data types within project data to\nensure that this process cannot be avoided by default. My project could save\nsignificant time and resources at the center and increase research efficiency.\nOnce implemented at the entire center, my program will assure data security\nfor present and future researchers.\n71\n\nNASA Armstrong Flight Research Center\n\nSummer 2015\n\nVictor Gabriel Ruiz\nCalifornia Polytechnic State University,\nPomona\n\nUniversities Space Research\nAssociation (USRA)\nUndergraduate Intern\nComputer Engineering\n\nMentor: Robert \xe2\x80\x9cRed\xe2\x80\x9d Jensen\nCode: R\nResearch and Engineering\n\nMechanical Design: PRANDTL-M and PRANDTL-3\nThe Prandtl airplanes and their wingtip designs have gained attention for their\nability to overcome adverse yaw and turn it into proverse yaw, all without a\nvertical tail.\nTwo new projects have emerged that are building on the successes of\nprevious Prandtl research projects. The Primary Research Aerodynamic\nDesign To Land on Mars (Prandtl-M) is a small, 24-inch wingspan, glider that\nwill be released from a high altitude in the Martian atmosphere and will send\nback to Earth high resolution images.\nThe Prandtl-3 is a larger scale version of the Prandtl-2. At 24 feet in\nwingspan, this larger size will allow for fiber optic strain sensing, as well as\npressure taps in the wing to detect changes in the pressure field around the\nlifting surfaces.\nMy objective is to provide mechanical design work for both of these projects\nand project teams to ensure all is on track for a timely completion. Through\nmeetings with the project teams and my mentors, the requirements for a\ncertain 3D model are specified and allow for less remodeling as the projects\nmove forward.\nPrandtl-M will provide a better look at the surface of Mars and will allow\nmore informed decisions to be made about future Mars missions, manned and\nunmanned.

The\nPRANDTL-M airframe must be durable enough to withstand the harsh environmental\nconditions present on Mars, but also be aerodynamic enough to maintain flight.\nEnvironmental testing will subject the airframe to temperatures and pressures beyond\nthose present on Mars to test functional limits. The data collected will be used to\nanalyze efficiency and durability. Several parameters must be considered, which\ninclude the center of gravity (CG) of both the fuselage and wing, weight of airframe,\nand aerodynamic shape. Since weight opposes lift and would negatively affect the\ndistance the aircraft would fly, foam was chosen as the lightest material for the\nfuselage. Drag will be reduced by designing a fuselage with the most streamlined\nsurfaces and configuration with an internal components bay to mitigate turbulence.\nUsing Creo Element Pro and SolidWorks, a design will be sketched and modeled\nwhere a 3D printer will construct the final fuselage for precision.
