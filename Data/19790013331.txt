The period since the first GEOP conference in 1972 has seen marked changes in global\ntidal modelling, with many new models produced in\nthe past two years. Two trends have been evident.\nThe first centers on the incorporation of terms\nfor ocean loading and gravitational self attraction into Laplace\'s Tidal Equations (LTE). The\nsecond centers on a better understanding of the\nproblem of near resonant modelling and the need\nfor realistic maps of tidal elevation for use by\ngeodesists and geophysicists. These trends are\ndescribed. Although new models still show significant differences, especially in the South\nAtlantic, there are significant similarities in\nmany of the world\'s oceans. This allows suggestions to be made for future locations for bottom\npressure guage measurements. Where available,\nestimates of M2 tidal dissipation from the new\nmodels are significantly lower than estimates from\nprevious models. The new estimates are consistent\nwith recent estimates of the rate of decelleration\nof the lunar longitude.\n\nL = QHV + [(QH)^ - (i/s)(QHtanhT) T ]3<J>\n+ [(QH) T + (i/s)(QHtanhT) < j ) ]3T\nF = (1/pD^KQF*)^ + (QF T ) T ]\n- (i/pDos)[(QtanhTF<f>)T - (QtanhTF7) ] (3)\n\nand\ne2 = \xc2\xab22a/gD\n\nQ = l/(s2-tanh2T)\n\nD\n\ns = cr/2fi\n\n= DoH ( ) T\n((,)\n\nF/g - 6 = U/g\n\nThe terms for ocean loading and self attraction\nwere incorporated into LTE by Hendershott [1972].\nThe effect that these terms have on LTE may be\nsummarized as follows.

The first centers on\nthe incorporation of the terms for ocean loading\nand gravitational self attraction into Laplace\'s\nTidal Equations (LTE). The second centers on a\nbetter understanding of the problem involved with\nnear resonant modelling and the need for realistic\nmaps of tidal elevation for use by geophysicists\nand geodesists. It is the purpose of this article\nto describe these two trends, and to look at what\nimprovements are likely in the future.\nBecause of the scope of the article, and since\nmany researchers have calculated models only for\nM2, only M2 models after 1972 will be presented.\nCalculations for other constituents will be mentioned in passing.

Gordeev, et.\nal [1977] showed that this procedure will converge\nin the presence of interior dissipation. Their\ncalculations based on the Longman [1963] Green\'s\nfunction are consistent with the importance of\nthese terms. Parke [1978a] showed dramatically\nthat the loading and self gravitation terms are\n\nF/g = (l+k2-h2)U2/g\n\n(7\n1)\n\nwhere the ocean terms were calculated based on the\nParke-Hendershott model discussed in the next section. These charts are shown in figures 1 and 2.\nNote the considerable distortion in the North\nAtlantic caused by the ocean effects. Historically researchers have had trouble with local\nmodels of the North Atlantic using the equillibrium potential. Perhaps this is the reason why.\nOver the past several years the importance of\nthe terms for ocean loading and self attraction\nhas gradually become accepted, with models sans\nocean loading effects being published as late as\n1977. Starting in 1972, the first iteration of\nHendershott is a model sans loading effects and is\npresented in figure 3. The calculation is based\non a six degree Mercator grid with specified elevation boundary conditions and implicit dissipation, i.e. F = 0. Energy is allowed to freely\nflow through the boundaries to be dissipated in\nthe shallow seas and shelves.\nZahel.[1973] calculated a model for Kl using a\nfour degree spherical mesh graded toward the\n\n290\n\nFig. 2.

Zahel presented, a similar calculation\nfor M2 on a one degree mesh at the IUGG meeting in\nGrenoble in 1975, and subsequently published\n[Zahel,1977]. Figure 4 is a copy of the cotidal .\nchart presented in 1975. Zahel has recently completed a model including loading effects (Trevor\nBaker, personnal communication).\nEstes [1977] repeated Zahel\'s procedure for M2\nusing a two degree mesh and allowing for deformation of the solid earth by the astronomical forcing. Resulting amplitudes were smaller as would\nbe expected. This calculation was extended to S2,\nN2,K2,K1,01, and PI. The M2 model was used as a\nstarting point for the iterative procedure of\nHendershott described above. Convergence was\nfound after 16 iterations. This model is shown in\nfigure 5.\nParke [1978b] solved the modified LTE on a six\ndegree Mercator mesh using specified elevation\nboundary conditions and no interior dissipation.\nThis was done by using a set of test functions\nsimilar to the iterates of Hendershott as a basis\nset for a least squares fit to the complete equations. The test functions were generated by the\nsame method as the iterates, except that period-\n\nically the best least squares fit was subtracted\nfrom the equations and an iterative sequence\nstarted on the residuals. This was done to aid\nnumerical stability. Solutions for M2 and S2 were\nfound to be unrealistically resonant, while for Kl\nthe iterative procedure of Hendershott was found\nto be convergent and the solution showed every\nsign of being far from resonance.\nAccad and Pekeris [1978] calculated models for\nM2 and S2 using a two degree mercator mesh with\nimplicit dissipation determined at the coasts by a\nmodified Proudman boundary condition. Instead of\ntreating the edge of the coastal shelves as a step\nfunction, they treat it as a linear ramp. For a\nstep function, the assumption that the energycontained in the upper layer (of depth h\') is dissipated rather than reflected leads to the usual\nProudman condition\n\nhu\nn\n\n(9\n1)\n\nwhere h is the depth offshore from the shelf and\nu is the normal velocity. When the edge of the\nshelf is considered as a ramp, this condition\nbecomes\n:\n\nhu\n\n(20)\n\nwhere R is a complex reflection coefficient\ndepending on S (the width of the ramp), h, and h\'.\nAccad and Pekeris used the values S = 100km and\nh1 = 10m, while h was taken to be the observed\n\n291\n\nFig. 3.\n\nPig. 4.\n\nThe Hendershott [1972] M2 tidal model, .(amplitudes in cm, phases in degrees)\n\nThe Zahel [1977] M2 tidal model, (amplitudes in cm, phases in lunar hours)\n\nvalue of the ocean depth closest to the grid point\non the coast.

Historical\nmodels of the semi-diurnal tides (primarily M2)\nshow significant differences, especially in the\nPacific and South Atlantic. Considering the\ncloseness to resonance of the problem, though, the\nlevel of agreement is actually quite remarkable.\n\n293\n\nThe fact that there are significant differences,\nhowever, means that to produce realistic maps of\nthe ocean tidal elevation the problem of resonance\nmust be handled. This problem arises because\nsmall errors in how one\'s model represents the\nreal ocean basins cause small errors in the frequencies at which the model basin resonates. Near\nresonance this causes a significant error in the\nassigned amplitudes for these modes.\nAs an example of a near resonant one mode sys-\n\nbottom friction term is adjusted within set limits\nat each boundary point and island station to force\nas close as possible agreement between the observed and calculated tides at these locations.\nLoading terms are approximated after Pekeris by\n\n.PUNTA PENASCO\nNORTH\n\nD*=D=?25m\n\na = 5xlO"3\n\n10\n\n= 650m\n\nE(l+k\'-h\')ct t, n\nn n .n on\n\no\n\nI\xe2\x80\x94\noe\nui\no\n\n180\n120\n\nN)*=D=725m\n\n60\n\n.5\n\nI\n\n1.5\nFREQUENCY\n\nI\n2\n2.5\n(CYCLES/DAY)\n\nFig. 7. A comparison of the tidal response at\nPunta Penasco North to the tide at the mouth of\nthe Gulf of California for two models with\ndifferent mean depth, after Stock [1976].\ntern, figure 7 shows the model response of the Gulf\nof California at two different mean depths after\nStock [1976]. Far from resonance, e.g. 01 and Kl,\nthe difference between the responses is small.\nNear resonance, however, e.g. for M2, S2, and N2,\nthe difference is quite significant. In a one\nmode system such as the Gulf of California, this\neffect can be adjusted with a single parameter\nsuch as the mean depth. The global.tide, however,\nappears to be more complex. Four possible\napproaches are:\n(1) If one knew the near resonant global\nnormal modes, one could adjust one\'s model accordingly.\n(2) One can adjust model parameters.\nSchwiderski [1978] follows this approach with a\none degree graded spherical mesh with linear eddy\ndissipation with eddy viscosity A given by\nA = aH(A,(j))L/2(l+iJcoscf>)\n\n(23)\n\nand a linear bottom friction term with coefficient\nB = bL ycoscj)\n\nO.U\n\no\n\n(25)\n\nwhere the factor 0.1 is attributed to Pekeris.\nA cotidal chart copied from a plot provided by Ron\nEstes is shown in figure 8. One consequence of\nforcing agreement at island stations is the creation of small scale local distortions. See for\nexample the Southwest Pacific.\n(3) Parke and Hendershott [1978] took the set\nof test functions used by Parke [1978b] to solve\nthe modified LTE in the absence of interior dissipation and fit them in the least squares sense to\ninterior (island) data. This was done for M2, S2,\nand Kl and represents a first order correction to\nthe problem. The resulting models are .:on a six .\ndegree Mercator mesh with specified elevation\nboundary conditions and dissipation only in shallow seas and on shelves. Encouraging is the fact\nthat the M2 calculation was shown to be stable\nover a \xc2\xb15% variation in the mean depth. All three\nrepresentations conserve mass. A cotidal chart\nfor M2 is given in figure 9.\n(4) Estes (personnal communication) proposes\ncombining models of the tide with other data such\nas altimetry and gravity measurements, with the\nmodel value at each point considered simply as\nanother datum.\nIt is interesting and provocative that the\nSchwiderski and Parke-Hendershott models show many\nqualitative and quantitative similarities throughout much of the worlds oceans. Starting with the\nPacific, both show a convergence of phases between\nJapan and New Guinea, amphidromes off California,\nLatin America, Chile, and in the Central Pacific.\nWest of the California amphidrome Schwiderski\nshows small amplitudes and a convergence of\nphases, while Parke-Hendershott shows a double\namphidrome. It should be noted that the absolute\ndifference between these two cases is small. The\namphidrome that Parke-Hendershott show southeast\nof New Zealand has moved much farther to the east\nand south in the Schwiderski model. Both show two\nanti-amphidromes in the Pacific; Parke-Hendershott\nat approximately 4\xc2\xb0N 174\xc2\xb0E and 2\xc2\xb0S 126\xc2\xb0W while\nSchwiderski places them at approximately 6\xc2\xb0S 176\xc2\xb0E\nand 4\xc2\xb0S 129\xc2\xb0W. The dominant feature of the Indian\nOcean for all models is a central anti-amphidrome.\nParke-Hendershott place this at approximately 18\xc2\xb0S\n78\xc2\xb0E while Schwiderski places it at approximately\n20\xc2\xb0S 78\xc2\xb0E. In the South Atlantic ParkeHendershott show a region of low amplitudes extending eastward from South America while\nSchwiderski shows a double amphidrome. Both show\nan anti-amphidrome next to the tip of Africa with\nParke-Hendershott placing it at approximately 32\xc2\xb0S\n5\xc2\xb0E and Schwiderski at 30\xc2\xb0S 10\xc2\xb0E.\n\n(24)\nDiscussion\n\nwhere a and b are trial and error parameters,.L is\nthe equatorial mesh size, y is the mesh grading\nparameter, and H(A,<j>) is the local depth of the\nocean.

Recent astronomical\nestimates include Muller [1977] with 3.3 \xc2\xb1 .2 x\n1019 ergs/sec and Goad and Douglas [1978] with 3.3\n\xc2\xb1 .4 x 1019 ergs/sec. It should be noted that the\nastronomical estimates are for all lunar dissipations not just M2. Estimates of the non-M2\n\n295\n\nocean contribution to lunar dissipation vary from\n0.3 - 1.0 x 1019 ergs/sec. This leaves a range\nfor the M2 ocean tidal dissipation based on the\nMuller estimate of 2.1 - 3.2 x 1019 ergs/sec.\nMiller [1966] estimates empirically a M2 dissipation in the shallow seas and shelves of 0.9 2.5 x ID-*-9 ergs/sec.

There are also\na number of qualitative similarities with the\nloading solutions of Estes and Accad and Perkeris.\nAll four models show two anti-amphidromes in the\nPacific and one in the Indian Ocean, although\nEstes\' anti-amphidrome in the eastern Pacific is\nmuch further south than that for the other three.\nEstes also shows an anti-amphidrome just west of\nthe tip of Africa similar to that of ParkeHendershott and Schwiderski. All four show amphidromes in the North Atlantic, in the South\nAtlantic near Antartica, off the coast of\nCalifornia, and in the central Pacific.\nAnti-amphidromes represent ideal places for\nbottom pressure guage measurements, since they are\nlocations of large ampitude and spacial stability.\nBecause of the strong similarities in the location\nand number of anti-amphidromes in the above M2\nmodels, a strong recommendation can be made as to\nwhere measurements should be taken. Thus the\nfollowing list of locations is recommended; near\n1\xc2\xb0S 175\xc2\xb0E, near 3\xc2\xb0S 128\xc2\xb0W, near 19\xc2\xb0S 78\xc2\xb0E, and\nnear 31\xc2\xb0S 8\xc2\xb0E. Also since there are relatively\nlarge variations from model to model in the\nSouth Atlantic between South America and Africa,\n30\xc2\xb0S 30\xc2\xb0W is recommended.\nAlthough new models for other constituents\nare not shown here, similar recommendations can\nbe made for S2. Accad and Pekeris\' S2 model\nshows anti-amphidromic points at 2\xc2\xb0N 176\xc2\xb0E, 10\xc2\xb0N\n142\xc2\xb0W, and 18\xc2\xb0S 74\xc2\xb0E while Parke-Hendershott\nshow anti-amphidromic points at 6\xc2\xb0N 172\xc2\xb0E, 8\xc2\xb0N\n142\xc2\xb0W, and 22\xc2\xb0S 75\xc2\xb0E. Therefore ideal locations\nfor S2 bottom pressure guage measurements would\n\n3.77\n\nnone\n\nyielding to\nastronomical\nforce only\n-\n\ncomplete potential\nusing Green\'s\nfunction\n\n~\n\nen t lm.1 1 e load J ng\nterms with O.K Q\n\nH2 - 2 . 2 2\n52 \xc2\xab 0.208\nKl = 0.221\n\ncomplete p o t p n t l n l\nusing Green\'s\nfunction\n\nM2 \xc2\xab 2.55\n\nestimate loading\n\nS2 - 0.526\n\nterms with\n0.085r,n\n\nbe at 4\xc2\xb0N 174\xc2\xb0E, 9\xc2\xb0N 142\xc2\xb0W, and 20\xc2\xb0S 74\xc2\xb0E. Not\nsurprisingly, two of the three locations are\nalmost identical with those for M2.\nFor the future, there are three potential\ndirections for improvement in the ability to represent the open ocean tide. All models refer\nback to known observations either directly\nthrough specified elevation boundary conditions,\nindirectly through adjustment of a friction\nparameter(s), or simply as a measure of model\nquality. Unfortunately, coastal observations are\non the wrong side of the shelves, and quite often\nin bays or estuaries. Island observations are\noften inside lagoons. The growing collection of\nbottom pressure guage measurements will help.\nCartwright and Zetler (personnel communication\nwith Zetler) are collecting present measurements\nfor publication by the International Association\nfor the Physical Sciences of the Ocean (IAPSO).\nShelf models of such difficult regions as the\nPatagonian Shelf will also help. Satellite\naltimetry measurements will ultimately provide\nspacial (if not as accurate) coverage of the\nglobal tide. In special regions where there\nare high tidal amplitudes and short length\nscales, so that the spacial structure of the tide\ncan be separated from orbit errors, existing\nsatellite data can quite possibly be utilized.\nAcknowledgements.
