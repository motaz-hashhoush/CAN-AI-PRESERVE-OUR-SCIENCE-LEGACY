The objective is to make a detailed examination of the constraints imposed by gravitational forces on Earth. The program is expected to lead ultimately to the development of new materials and processes in Earth-based commercial applications, adding to this nation's technological base. An important resource that U.S. researchers have readily available to them is the new Microgravity Materials Science Laboratory (MMSL) at NASA Lewis Research Center in Cleveland. A typical scenario for a microgravity materials experiment at Lewis would begin by establishing 1-g baseline data in the MMSL and then proceeding, if it is indicated, to a drop tower or to simulated microgravity conditions in a research aircraft to qualify the project for space flight. A major component of Lewis microgravity materials research work involves the study of metal and alloy solidification fundamentals.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 19860015850, "endDate": "1986-05-15T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Foundrymen's Society"}}, "meetingId": "55aa612e5c7c41a5877f43187e2be12c", "id": "dffd243bbae6481793e90fa6a3658b32"}], "name": "Casting Congress", "location": "Minneapolis, MN", "id": "55aa612e5c7c41a5877f43187e2be12c", "startDate": "1986-05-11T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 19860015850, "id": "eb5a2e37fd1a4b3e852d78019bdc0cb3", "publicationDate": "1986-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19860015850.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19860015850/downloads/19860015850.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19860015850/downloads/19860015850.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19860015850/downloads/19860015850.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
