b'Sensors Increase Productivity in Harsh Environments\nOriginating Technology/NASA Contribution\n\nA\n\nteam of scientists at Glenn Research Center,\noperating under the Aeronautics Research Mission\nDirectorate\xe2\x80\x99s Aviation Safety and Fundamental\nAeronautics programs, developed a series of technologies\nfor testing aircraft engine combustion chambers. The\nteam, led by electronics engineer Dr. Robert Okojie,\ndesigned a packaging technique and chip fabrication\nmethods for creating silicon carbide (SiC) pressure sensors\n\nto improve jet engine testing. According to Okojie, the\nteam was \xe2\x80\x9cworking to develop pressure sensors that\nwould be used to more accurately measure pressure inside\njet engine combustion chambers where the temperature\nis very high.\xe2\x80\x9d Okojie\xe2\x80\x99s team also understood that \xe2\x80\x9cdue\nto their temperature limitations, conventional pressure\nsensors are usually kept further away from the sensed\nenvironment. As a result, measurement accuracy is\ngenerally compromised. In addition, vital dynamic\ninformation could be lost due to frequency attenuation.\n\nThis new technology is meant to be inserted in close\nproximity with the sensed environment, thus eliminating\nthese disadvantages.\xe2\x80\x9d\nSiC-based pressure sensors fabricated using these\nNASA technologies can operate for over 130 hours at\n600 \xc2\xb0C. These durable chips are applicable in engine\nground testing and short-duration flight test instrumentation. Kathy Needham, director of the Technology\nTransfer and Partnership Office at Glenn, explains, \xe2\x80\x9cWe\nhave been spearheading the use of silicon carbide in sensors for some time now\xe2\x80\x94the material withstands high\ntemperatures and allows measurements to be taken closer\nto the source. As an added advantage, the new sensors\nare less complex than current, similar sensors, reducing\nthe likelihood of performance failure, allowing them to\nbe manufactured relatively inexpensively, and reducing\nsystem maintenance needs.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThese factors also lend the technology to other uses,\nincluding commercial jet testing, deep well-drilling\napplications where pressure and temperature increase\nwith drilling depth, and in automobile combustion\nchambers. As Okojie explains, \xe2\x80\x9cI see this technology\nbeing inserted in commercial jet engines and in deep wells\nwhile prospecting for oil. In commercial engine use, more\naccurate measurement of pressure would lead to improved\nengine safety by monitoring precursors of thermo-acoustic\ninstability that leads to flame-out, efficient combustion of\nfuel and reduction of unwanted emission of hydrocarbons\nand nitrogen oxides. In deep well drilling, it would\nallow for longer term insertion into the wells, thereby\nsignificantly saving the cost of equipment maintenance\nand down time.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPartnership\n\nGlenn Research Center licensed three patents, covering high-temperature, harsh-environment, silicon carbide pressure sensors,\nto Endevco Corporation.\n\n150\t Industrial Productivity \t\n\nTo explore and develop these commercial uses,\nCalifornia\xe2\x80\x99s San Juan Capistrano-based Endevco\nCorporation, a division of the Meggitt PLC group,\nlicensed three patents covering the high-temperature,\nharsh-environment silicon carbide pressure sensors from\nSpinoff 2008\n\nGlenn. Collaboration between the two dates back to 2000,\nwhen, during combustion tests, Glenn used an Endevco\nsilicon-based accelerometer as a benchmark device to\nvalidate its SiC accelerometer. The test results showed\nthat the NASA device operated as well as the Endevco\nmodel, but the NASA-developed device had the added\nadvantage of operating at much higher temperatures.\nThis led to discussions between Endevco and Glenn\nabout licensing opportunities to acquire Glenn\xe2\x80\x99s SiC\npressure and accelerometer sensor fabrication and\npackaging technologies.\nEndevco met with the Glenn researchers on numerous\noccasions during the following years. After witnessing\nthe advantages of the NASA technology first-hand, the\ncompany licensed the three NASA patents for commercial\ndevelopment with the caveat that Okojie would continue\nto work on the project and help the company overcome\nany outstanding technical issues. Okojie agrees with the\nimportance of this arrangement. \xe2\x80\x9cThe transfer of this\ntechnology to the commercial sector,\xe2\x80\x9d he says, \xe2\x80\x9cwould\nextend the utilization of the products beyond the\ngovernment (NASA, DOE, and DoD) to civil aviation,\nwith derivative applications particularly in the efficient\nmanagement of fuel combustion and the reduction of\nunwanted combustion byproducts.\xe2\x80\x9d\nBuilding on years of already successful collaboration,\nthe partnership now steers these novel technologies toward\ntheir envisioned commercial applications. \xe2\x80\x9cEndevco is the\nideal partner to bring this NASA technology to market,\nsince the company already has a proven track record in\nthe field and is now willing to commit to making this\nnew technology accessible to industry,\xe2\x80\x9d Needham\nelaborates. \xe2\x80\x9cThe company,\xe2\x80\x9d she continues, \xe2\x80\x9cis planning a\nnew product line, enabling this high-performance NASA\ntechnology to achieve widespread use.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nProduct Outcome\nFounded in 1947, Endevco supports its customers\nwith a global network of manufacturing and research\nSpinoff 2008\t\n\nDr. Robert Okojie, a researcher in the Sensors and Electronics Branch at Glenn, is a testament to the quality of a research\nenvironment that nurtures talent and ability at Glenn Research Center.\n\nfacilities, sales offices, and field engineers, providing\ntrusted solutions for the world\xe2\x80\x99s most challenging\nmeasurement applications. In its more than 60 years\nof operation, Endevco has become a world leader in\nsensing solutions for demanding vibration, shock, and\npressure applications. It was the company NASA trusted\n\nwhen it needed a benchmark device for its testing, and\nwhen the company saw that NASA had developed\ntechnologies that could improve the sensing field, it\nacted on the opportunity to license the cutting-edge\nknow-how. NASA\xe2\x80\x99s SiC technology is Endevco\xe2\x80\x99s latest\ncutting-edge offering. v\n\nIndustrial Productivity\t 151\n\n'
