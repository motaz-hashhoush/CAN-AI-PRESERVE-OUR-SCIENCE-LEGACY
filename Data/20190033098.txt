Crooke/NASA GSFC, Matthew Bolcar/NASA GSFC, Jason Hylan/NASA GSFC\nLead Author Contact Information:\nJulie.A.Crooke@nasa.gov\nOffice Phone: 301-286-7255\nCell Phone: 301-325-0806\n\nDue: July 10, 2019\n1\n\n1 Key Issue and Overview of Impact on the Field\n1.1 Summary of the Issue:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nNASA has historically struggled with estimating the final cost and schedule duration of its large\n\xe2\x80\x9cflagship\xe2\x80\x9d missions.\nThe accuracy of cost estimates and schedule planning increases with concept maturity. Early\nassessments necessarily underestimate the total mission cost and schedule, and lead to inevitable\ncost growth and schedule delays.\nCost and schedule assessment \xe2\x80\x9ccheckpoints\xe2\x80\x9d should be made throughout a NASA flagship\nmission\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cFormulation Phase\xe2\x80\x9d. As the concept develops, more accurate cost and schedule\nestimates are made.\nAt each of these checkpoints through the end of Phase B, accurate funding for the next block of\nwork can be determined and allocated, thus enabling cost and schedule growth to be anticipated\nand controlled.\nA final cost assessment at the start of Phase C, NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Key Decision Point C (\xe2\x80\x9cKDP-C\xe2\x80\x9d), will\nprovide the highest fidelity cost estimate and allow for an informed commitment from the Agency to\ncomplete the mission\xe2\x80\x99s implementation on schedule and within budget.\nFunding of NASA\xe2\x80\x99s flagships has required annual Congressional appropriations that are unstable in\ntwo ways: (1) the funding profile (total amount of funding for a given year) is not based on what a\nproject needs, rather, it is based on what funding is available, forcing an inefficient project\nexecution whereby a project must defer work; (2) Continuing Resolutions (CRs) are the norm\npreventing necessary year-to-year funding increases that are necessary to complete new work.\nFully funding multi-year blacks of work based on each cost and schedule assessment checkpoint\nwill provide budget stability and allow project schedules to be executed efficiently and optimally.\nMulti-year funding mechanisms have been for ~70 years for large projects within the Department of\nDefense (DoD), and could be applied to NASA\xe2\x80\x99s flagship missions.\nUsing these methods to control cost and schedule growth will enable NASA to complete more\nflagship missions at a higher cadence.\n\nWhy do NASA\xe2\x80\x99s flagship missions cost significantly more and take longer to complete than originally\nplanned? What steps can be taken to improve their cost and schedule performance during development?\nWhile there are a myriad of reasons that contribute to NASA\xe2\x80\x99s flagship development cost and schedule\noverruns that have been documented in many lessons learned publications1-17, some lessons keep\nshowing up multiple times. This white paper focuses on one of these: Funding. In particular, we advocate to\nchoose to assess the total funding needed at a few development gates/design level maturities, and\ndistinctly, choose to implement funding methods already used for other government flagship-level projects,\nto greatly improve on NASA\xe2\x80\x99s development cost and schedule performance.\nProcess to establish increased confidence and accuracy in cost assessments:\nWhile immature mission concepts and immature cost assessments are historic reasons for not\nunderstanding and appreciating the full development costs and schedules needed to bring NASA\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98oneoff\xe2\x80\x99, ground-breaking, flagship missions to fruition, NASA and the Astro2020 Decadal have vastly improved\nupon both of these issues.\n\n1\n\nIn 2010, the Decadal Survey in Astronomy and Astrophysics (\xe2\x80\x9cAstro2010\xe2\x80\x9d) contracted with The Aerospace\nCorporation to perform cost and risk assessments using the Cost and Technical Evaluation (CATE)\nprocess. This was the first time such an assessment was performed as part of a Decadal Survey. Although\nall of the large mission concepts were assessed through this rigorous process, not all of the large mission\nconcepts were at the same level of maturity. Mature mission concepts and mature cost assessments are\nboth needed. If the concepts being evaluated are not mature enough, the cost assessments are not going\nto be mature enough.\nFor the 2020 Decadal Survey in Astronomy and Astrophysics (\xe2\x80\x9cAstro2020\xe2\x80\x9d), NASA improved upon this\nprocess. In January of 2015, NASA solicited input from the community on which large strategic (\xe2\x80\x9cflagship\xe2\x80\x9d)\nmission concepts should be studied in preparation for Astro2020. In 2016, after a year of communitysolicited input, NASA chartered four community-endorsed flagship mission concept studies that are now\ncommunity-led by Science and Technology Definition Teams (STDTs)18, 25. Each concept study was\nassigned to a NASA center for engineering, technology, science, and study support. These mission\nconcepts have been studied in detail for 3.5 years (January 2016- August 2019) with significant resources\nto bring their point designs to Concept Maturity Level 4 (CML4)19, the maturity level at which accurate cost\nand risk assessments can begin to be made. This is the first time, ever, that all community-endorsed,\nflagship mission concepts will have achieved this level of detailed maturity prior to a Decadal Survey. In\naddition, the Aerospace Corporation will perform Technical, Risk, and Cost Evaluation (TRACE)\nassessments on all of the point designs developed by these four flagship mission concept teams.\nHence, Astro2020 will be the first time that all flagship missions submitted by NASA will have achieved the\nsame level of detailed maturity, and be rigorously assessed for cost and technical risks using a uniform\nprocess. This represents a significant improvement in understanding each missions\xe2\x80\x99 science return as a\nfunction of cost.\nHowever, this is not the last step in understanding and controlling a large mission\xe2\x80\x99s lifecycle costs. After the\nDecadal survey recommends agency priorities, we recommend assessing the cost and risk of the\nprioritized mission at multiple points in its development including up to the mission development\xe2\x80\x99s Key\nDecision Point-C (\xe2\x80\x9cKDP-C\xe2\x80\x9d), the point at which the development officially ends Formulation at the end of\nPhase B and enters the beginning of Implementation known as Phase C. Performing a final cost\nassessment at KDP-C ensures the mission has reached a maturity level commensurate with achieving an\naccurate cost estimate suitable for appropriating the remaining required funding to complete the mission\xe2\x80\x99s\ndevelopment3.\nProcess to disburse funds to enable better mission development cost and schedule performance:\nThe Funding Profile and Funding Stability Matter:\nEven if NASA\xe2\x80\x99s flagship missions have early and accurate cost assessments, their current funding\nimplementation method all but guarantees development cost and schedule overruns. Once a flagship\nmission is prioritized by the Decadal and approved by NASA for development, there are historic and\nrepeated issues with the funding methodology during their developments that have been cited1-11, 20-21 as\nsignificant contributors to their cost and schedule overruns, namely, back-loaded funding profiles and\nunstable funding.\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s budget is appropriated on an annual basis. Flagships are supposed to receive an annual budget\nfrom Congress at the beginning of every fiscal year (FY). Congress has passed a NASA budget on-time\nonly 7 times in the history of NASA1. Continuing Resolutions (CRs) are the norm for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s budgets. CRs\n2\n\ngo into effect when a budget is not passed and there is a lapse in funding. A CR forces a status quo budget\nlevel from the previous year, hence, a CR does not allow for an increase in project budget needs.\nThe total funding amount including reserves, the funding profile, and the funding stability for any large\nproject across the government (NASA, DoD, etc.) are matters out of the control of any given flagship\nmission\xe2\x80\x99s project manager and project management team. Even the best of the best of project managers\nwill fail to deliver on a mission\xe2\x80\x99s development cost and schedule performance without addressing the issue\nof the total amount of funds disbursed to the project, and, in particular, when those funds are disbursed to\nthe project. These are the issues of an appropriate funding profile and stable funding. Congress has\nrecognized, since the 1950s, the importance of appropriate and stable funding for large DoD development\nprojects such as aircraft carriers, submarines, tankers, fighter jets, and helicopters3, 12-17. NASA would\ngreatly benefit from embracing this approach and have Congress and others recognize the importance and\nimpact that this type of funding would have on NASA\xe2\x80\x99s flagship developments compared to how NASA\xe2\x80\x99s\nflagships are currently funded. As mentioned, Congress has been consistently providing appropriate and\nstable funding through multiple vehicles: No-Year Funding, Incremental Funding, Multiyear Procurement\n(MYP), Block Buy Contracting (BBC), Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) Authority, Advance Procurement\n(AP), and Cost-to-Complete Procurement Funding. NASA\xe2\x80\x99s flagship missions are of similar (and, arguably,\neven greater) caliber national assets that deserve and need the same type of full-funding policy that the\nDoD large projects have benefited from for more than half a century. Each of NASA\xe2\x80\x99s flagships is a \xe2\x80\x9coneoff\xe2\x80\x9d, unique, complex system, state-of-the-art, national-asset, the scientific discoveries of which are admired\nnot only nationally, but world-wide. NASA\xe2\x80\x99s flagships fundamentally change the human race\xe2\x80\x99s\nunderstanding of our universe and our place in it, forever.\nThere are three distinct funding aspects of current NASA flagships that have a significant impact on the\nmission\xe2\x80\x99s development cost and schedule: (1) total funding amount including reserves, (2) funding profile\n(timing/phasing of the funding), and (3) funding stability. In the following sections, these funding attributes\nare discussed in terms of their current methods and impacts while alternative funding approach solutions\nare offered along with their associated benefits.\n\n1.2 How it impacts the field of astronomy and astrophysics:\n\nThe community-at-large, including the public, Congress, the astronomical community, academia, federal\ngovernment agencies, industry, NASA itself, and even international partners rightfully and justifiably\ncomplain when NASA says a mission will cost X and take Y time to be developed and in the end costs\nsignificantly more than X and takes significantly longer than Y to be launch-ready. Understandably,\neveryone wants better cost and schedule performance on NASA\xe2\x80\x99s flagship mission developments while not\ncompromising the mission\xe2\x80\x99s on-orbit performance. The cost of NASA\xe2\x80\x99s flagship missions should not only be\nbetter understood going into development, but also better understood in terms of recognizing and explicitly\nacknowledging the impact that the funding implementation method has on a mission\xe2\x80\x99s development1, 3, 20-21\ncost and schedule performance. With proper funding estimates and execution of disbursing the funding,\nNASA will vastly improve on the cost and schedule performance of their flagship missions, thus, enabling\nbetter execution planning of NASA\xe2\x80\x99s entire portfolio of missions.\n\n1.3 Why it should be addressed in the Survey.\n\nAstro2020 and the community have a stake in the cost and schedule performance of NASA\xe2\x80\x99s flagship\nmissions. NASA and the community love the awe-inspiring science discoveries of these missions like the\nHubble Space Telescope (HST), Mars Science Lab (MSL), Cassini, Chandra, Galileo, and Voyager.\n3\n\nAstro2020 will assess the science, feasibility, executability, and cost of the four large, strategic, mission\nconcepts submitted by NASA. The science per dollar value (of all classes and sizes) of missions plays a big\nrole in their evaluation. One of the biggest considerations of a mission is its development cost. If the\ncommunity understands the big picture regarding the different knobs that can be turned and their impact to\nenable NASA\xe2\x80\x99s flagship missions to have better development cost and schedule performance, this may\nlead to more trust in NASA by the public and may lead to more flagship missions over the decades\nbecause NASA would then be able to execute the development of flagship missions more efficiently and\neffectively.\nIn addition to prioritizing NASA\xe2\x80\x99s next astrophysics flagship\xe2\x80\x99s science goals, the Astro2020 Decadal\ncommittee may want to understand and acknowledge to the community the significance that the funding\nimplementation method has on the cost and schedule performance of NASA\xe2\x80\x99s flagship developments.\nIt is the intent of this White Paper to lay out the arguments for, and hopefully convince the Astro2020\nDecadal committee to make recommendations to NASA that might help address the issue of full and stable\nfunding (a repeated lesson1-17, 20-21) to help improve NASA\xe2\x80\x99s flagship mission\xe2\x80\x99s development cost and\nschedule performance - for the benefit of all stakeholders. Several funding options are offered including\nways of funding different portions for different phases of development1, 3, 12-17, 20-21. These different funding\nmethodologies follow what others entities have recommended3 for NASA and are in close alignment with\nhow other government agencies have funded their flagship large projects for ~ 70 years and continue to do\nso today12-17.\n\n2 Strategic Plan: A plan of action or policy designed to achieve a major goal.\n\nBefore addressing the strategy that can be implemented, we will first describe the ideal end goal to enable\na predictable mission cost and a method of funding to enable the most efficient execution of a flagship\xe2\x80\x99s\ndevelopment. We will then identify NASA\xe2\x80\x99s current flagship funding methods and issue. Finally, we will\npropose solutions.\n\n2.1 The Ideal Goal: More Accurate Cost Assessments and An Efficient Mission\nDevelopment Execution Enabled by a Full Funding Policy:\n2.1.1 End Goal #1: More Accurate Cost Assessments at Several Increasing Mission Maturity\nLevels:\nBy virtue of each of NASA\xe2\x80\x99s flagships being unique and unrivaled in what they can achieve scientifically for\nhumankind, they typically have equally unique and unrivaled technologies that need to be matured and\narchitectures that need to be informed by those technologies. This process takes time. As we\xe2\x80\x99ve\nestablished, accurate cost estimates cannot be assessed without mature concepts and designs. Therefore,\nin addition to making a single cost estimate at the time of the Decadal Survey, the ideal scenario would be\nto assess costs with appropriately-sized error bars for each maturity level achieved. As the development\nmatures, the error bars should get smaller, and a final cost assessment should be performed once the\nmission has reached the necessary maturity level at NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Key Decision Point-C (\xe2\x80\x9cKDP-C\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\n2.1.2 End Goal #2: An Efficient Development Execution Enabled by an Executable Funding\nProfile:\nOnce a flagship mission has a final, mature cost estimate at KDP-C including appropriately assessed cost\nreserves, one of several full-funding policies (described in Section 2.3.2 of this white paper) will enable a\n4\n\nflagship project team to execute the remainder of the development of the mission. This development must\nfollow an integrated master schedule that has been carefully orchestrated from the start to the finish. From\ncomponents to assemblies, to subsystems and systems, up to the observatory level, all of these\ndevelopments need to happen on-time, and often parallel to one another. Punctual funding enables\nexecution of these critically-timed milestones to procure, build, integrate, and test hardware starting with the\nlowest level assemblies up to the highest level of observatory integration, test, verification, and validation.\nThe goal is to successfully complete the development as efficiently as possible. Any of several full funding\npolicies already used elsewhere in the government12-17 will enable this as described in Section 2.3.2.\n\n2.1.3 In Summary:\nPer many past NASA flagships lessons learned1-11 and recommendations by others3, there are paths\nforward to achieve more accurate cost assessments and funding methods that will enable NASA\xe2\x80\x99s flagship\ndevelopments to perform significantly better on cost and schedule.\n\n2.2 NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Current Flagship Development and Funding Methods and Issues:\nSummary of the current funding issues combined\nImmature mission concepts beget -> Inaccurate Cost Estimates -> beget Low-Level Initial Funding\n-> begets a non-optimized and inefficient development schedule -> begets longer and more\nexpensive developments -> begets delaying the next flagship -> begets fewer flagships -> begets\ncommunity frustration\nCongress appropriates funding for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s flagships annually in a budget line item. Annual appropriations\nfor NASA\xe2\x80\x99s flagships typically start off with a relatively small budget wedge that is often based on what\nfunding is available and not on what a project actually needs to accomplish that year\xe2\x80\x99s tasks. Year after\nyear, the project\xe2\x80\x99s annual budget slowly ramps, again usually based on available funding each fiscal year.\nThe budget pressure that restricts available funds has recently been caused by the previous flagship\nmission that is completing its development, verification, and launch.\nDuring this time of restricted funding, several critical steps in the new flagship\xe2\x80\x99s development are occurring:\n1. As per current NASA guidance, technologies are continuing to be developed to TRL 6 by the new\nmission\xe2\x80\x99s Preliminary Design Review (PDR)20-21. These undemonstrated technologies increase the\nrisk to the mission development (to some an unacceptable amount of risk)1, 3, 20-21.\n2. A \xe2\x80\x9cmarching army\xe2\x80\x9d is fielded to begin detailed design of the system. Since many of the\ntechnologies have not been fully developed, there can be To-Be-Resolved (TBRs) and To-BeDetermined (TBDs) in the formal requirements 20-21.\n3. The science scope may still be in flux, therefore, the science requirements and all lower level\nrequirements are still in flux1, 3, 20-21.\n4. Contractors are being identified and agreements are being finalized while the final design is not yet\nmature20-21.\nWhile all of these things are happening, the project is receiving fewer resources than it needs, all because\nof (a) the early underestimated mission cost, and (b) insufficiently available funds from the budget wedge.\nBecause the project receives less funding than what is needed to enable a nominal parallel development\nprogram, the project is forced to defer work from the very beginning. Deferment of work has cascading and\n5\n\ncompounding consequences for a complex mission. A typical flagship is a complex system of systems with\ninterdependent layers of nested subsystems, and with a nominal sequence of hardware developments to\nenable an optimized development schedule. Any deferment of work lengthens the overall development\nschedule, and thus requires the marching army to remain on the project for a longer period of time, thus\ncosting more and taking longer to complete the work. Consequently, this delays the next prioritized Decadal\nmission. For instance, JWST was prioritized in the 2000 Astro Decadal. For many reasons, some\nmentioned in this white paper as well as other reasons described in published lessons learned1-3, JWST\nhas, understandably, taken longer to develop than originally planned. WFIRST was prioritized in the 2010\nDecadal. But the delays to JWST have, in turn, delayed the start of the development of WFIRST. Only\nwhen the previous flagship mission\xe2\x80\x99s development is nearing completion, does a \xe2\x80\x9cbudget wedge\xe2\x80\x9d open up\nfor the next Decadal priority mission. And, the available \xe2\x80\x9cbudget wedge\xe2\x80\x9d may or may not be commensurate\nwith what the next flagship needs, thereby starting the issue and impact cycle all over again.\nAccording to the 2012 NASA Office of Inspector General (OIG) Report, \xe2\x80\x9cNASA\xe2\x80\x99s Challenges to Meeting\nCost, Schedule, and Performance Goals\xe2\x80\x9d, Report No. IG-12-021, pg. 25, \xe2\x80\x9cIn general, managers may be\nforced to invest time and effort re-planning tasks to fit unexpected funding profiles, deferring critical tasks to\nlater phases of development, or de-scoping or discontinuing lower priority tasks to keep project costs within\nthe revised budget profile. When it occurs in the early phases of a project, inadequate funding decreases\nmanagement\xe2\x80\x99s ability to identify and address key risks. For example, when planned funding does not\nmaterialize, project managers may defer development of critical technologies to a time when integration of\nthose technologies may be more difficult or when the cost of material and labor may be greater. For\nexample, the JWST Independent Cost Review Panel noted that deferred work on that Project cost two to\nthree times more than original estimates. In addition, shifting tasks to later project phases may require\nmanagers to sustain a workforce longer than originally planned or add shifts in an attempt to make up for\nlost time, both of which can lead to increased costs. Furthermore, as some tasks are contingent on\ncompletion of other deliverables, shifting tasks to later phases can have a cascading effect on a project\xe2\x80\x99s\nmaster schedule resulting in even higher costs.\xe2\x80\x9d 1\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe single biggest challenge to managing a project at NASA is budget uncertainty. A project develops a\nbudget to successfully accomplish the implementation of the project and, invariably, through the review\nprocess that budget is deemed unaffordable and [the] project is challenged to succeed with less. A typical\napproach is for the project to be cut in the near years with the cuts replenished in the out years causing the\nfunding profile to be back loaded - the very thing it should not be. Starved for resource[s] early, the project\nis left to make inefficient decisions \xe2\x80\x93 take on technical risks or defer work - that will come home to roost\nlater. On top of that is the annual uncertainty of budget approval - both in amount of budget and timing of\napproval \xe2\x80\x93 so at each fiscal year boundary the project is force[d] to consider changes to their plan that will\nimpact efficient execution of their plan. After a few years the plan the project is executing on looks nothing\nlike the plan \xe2\x80\x93 schedule and budget wise \xe2\x80\x93 the project embarked on at the beginning. Some of that change\ncan be considered driven by internal events like technologies not panning out as planned, parts issues, etc.\nbut the bulk of it is driven by external forces altering their budget.\xe2\x80\x9d 1\n\n2.3 Solution Strategies:\n\nThe two distinct NASA flagship development funding implementation aspects are the (1) assessment of the\ntotal amount of funding needed including reserves, and (2) disbursement of the funding including the\nfunding profile (timing/phasing of the funding) and the funding stability. Each of these is addressed\nseparately as they each have different recommended solutions.\n6\n\n2.3.1 Total Funding Cost and Risk Assessment:\nAccurate cost and risk assessments inform the total funding needed. The mission concept maturity informs\nthe cost estimate confidence levels and the risk assessments inform the amount of funding reserves\nrequired. The cost assessment should start with larger error bars in the earlier phases of development. As\nthe mission progresses and matures, the errors bars should get smaller. The risk assessment should\ninform the amount of reserves a mission development needs. As the mission development progresses and\nmatures, the amount of reserves required should decrease over time.\nA mission\xe2\x80\x99s required total funding and risk assessment needs to be increasingly accurate for each\nsubsequent phase along a mission\xe2\x80\x99s development timeline. As previously stated, independent cost and risk\nassessments should not happen just once3, rather upon entering different phases (\xe2\x80\x9cgates\xe2\x80\x9d) of a mission\xe2\x80\x99s\ndevelopment, where the last gate occurs at the mission\xe2\x80\x99s Key Decision Point-C (KDP-C). The development\nphases of NASA\xe2\x80\x99s missions consist of Formulation (Phases A and B) (and arguably, this should include\nPre-Phase A20-21and see Section 2.3.1.1 of this white paper) and Implementation (Phases C and D).\n- Prior to the Decadal, the mission concepts need to reach a certain level of maturity (CML4) in order\nto be placed in appropriate cost \xe2\x80\x9cboxes\xe2\x80\x9d i.e., cost ranges within some level of confidence. As stated in\nsection 1.1 of this white paper, this has been accomplished for all four (4) Astro2020 large strategic\n(flagship) mission concept study teams from having studied their concepts for over 3.5 years. Each\nSTDT-community-led team has prioritized science goals and developed science traceability matrices;\nperformed architecture, technology, and engineering trades; designed telescopes and instruments that\ncan accomplish their science goals; developed technology roadmaps including costs and schedules to\nbring all technologies to TRL 6; generated detailed master equipment lists (MELs), and produced\ndevelopment schedules - all criteria to achieving concept maturity level 4 (CML4)19. The flagship\nmission concept teams have developed point designs that should be considered proof-of-concept point\ndesigns in a trade space of many potential designs that could be developed in the future. This has\nbeen achieved for the four Astro2020 flagship mission concepts.\n-\n\nIn Pre-Phase A, NASA should stand up a Project Office for the highest priority flagship mission\nconcept to oversee, perform, and enable maturation of several things during Pre-Phase A to (a)\nmature all technologies to TRL6, including performing subscale system demonstrations20, (b) mature\nthe architecture, (3) mature the science requirements based on the Astro2020 Decadal\nrecommendations, (4) mature the plans and tools for system verification including Systems\nEngineering Modeling and Analysis, facility and transportation planning, to name some of the major\nactivities that should be matured before entering into Phase A. Eventually, the technologies that\nmature and become the most promising inform and influence the final architecture. Fund these\nactivities for a limited time period on an annual basis before entering into Phase A.\no Benefits: By maturing the mission architecture and concept earlier in the development (PrePhase A), there are many benefits:\n1. This minimizes risk early in the development reducing the overall cost and risk by\nperforming the maturation process with a significantly smaller \xe2\x80\x9cmarching army\xe2\x80\x9d.\n2. This enables the necessary iteration of science requirements to evolve while being\ninformed by the architecture, technologies, and other internal or external factors.\n\n7\n\n3. This enables clearer understandings of the best locations for interfaces and their\nrequirements for the eventual design such that when those designs are developed,\nthere are fewer TBRs and TBDs.\n4. This reduces the known risks off the critical path where once on the critical path\nschedule, there is a large army that is hustling to meet those deadlines, etc.\nPre-Phase A ends when all technologies are at TRL6 including validating the mission architecture with\nsubscale system demonstrations and maturing the science requirements with a community-led science\nsteering committee. At the end of Pre-Phase A, a higher fidelity cost and risk assessment should be\nperformed.\n-\n\n-\n\nIn Phases A and B, given all technologies are at TRL6 now, the architecture has been demonstrated\nwith subscale system demonstrations, the science requirements have been cyclically matured and\nvetted with stakeholders, and a higher fidelity cost and risk assessment has been independently\nperformed, a specific point design can be initiated at the start of Phase A and developed through\nPhase B with their normal NASA milestone requirements developed. Independent cost and risk\nassessments should be performed at the end of both Phase A and Phase B. Fund Phases A and B\nwith the needed resources and needed funding profile with multi-year appropriations.\nBy KDP-C, the mission design will be mature with well-defined and clear requirements flowed down to\nall subsystems and components with established interface requirements. The expected science\nperformance characteristics should be validated through modeling with technical error budgets flowed\ndown to all hardware. \xe2\x80\x9cBreadboard\xe2\x80\x9d testbeds and pathfinders should have verified the technical\nspecifications of the design as well as informed integration, alignment, and test procedures. This\nvalidated maturity level will enable a final independent cost and risk assessment that can be used for\nthe final appropriation with a full funding mechanism required to execute the remainder of the\nmission\xe2\x80\x99s development in Phases C and D.\n\nAt each of the above flagship mission\xe2\x80\x99s development phases, the cost and risk assessments should inform\nthe total funding amount for the next phase, such that along the development timeline, the cost assessment\nerror bars are getting smaller while the reserve posture and assessments are decreasing over time.\nAlthough the reserve assessments should decrease over time for the known risks, adequate reserves\nshould still enable accommodating the unknown risks. Historical databases of actual mission costs should\ninform these funding decisions.\n\n2.3.2 Method of Disbursing the Funding to Enable an Executable Mission Development:\n\nAfter KDP-C, with a mature cost assessment in hand, Congress should appropriate the funding using any\nof the several Full-Funding Policy methods currently benefiting all DoD flagship missions.\nFull Funding Policy Methods/Options Available to DoD Large Projects:\nHere are some Full Funding Policy methods and options available to all DoD large projects3, 12-17, 20-21 that\nwould benefit NASA\xe2\x80\x99s flagship development cost and schedule performance. Brief definitions are provided\nfor each funding type below:\n- No-year (Zero-year) Funding: All funding for building/developing DoD large projects is appropriated\nall at once in a single lump sum before starting the development.\n- Incremental Funding: The funding for building DoD large projects is appropriated in 2 or more year\nincrements, typically ~2-5 years, and in amounts that do not limit long-lead items being purchased or\n8\n\n-\n\n-\n\ndoes not limit the development of anything due to lack of funding in a given year. In other words, this is\nstill front-loaded funding. However, each year requires an appropriation bill to be passed by Congress.\nMultiyear Procurement (MYP) and Block Buy Contracting (BBC), and Economic Order Quantity\nAuthority16:\nMultiyear procurement (MYP) and Block Buy Contracting (BBC) are contract funding mechanisms that\nallow a certain percentage of savings, sometimes less than 5% to sometimes greater than 15%, over\nthe traditional contracts that require annual renewal by Congress by allowing a single contract to be\nvalid for several years\xe2\x80\x99 worth of funding without having to renew the contract each year. This is allowed\nfor a limited number of defense acquisition programs.\no Multiyear Procurement (MYP)16:\nUnder a MYP contract, a single contract requires congressional approval in the first year that\nenables stable funding for two to five years\xe2\x80\x99 worth of procurement without requiring\nCongressional annual renewal in the following years. MYPs must be approved in both a DoD\nappropriations act and a non-DoD appropriations act. However, to qualify for an MYP contract,\na program must meet legal criteria according to statute, 10 U.S.C. 2306b.\no Block Buy Contracting (BBC)16:\nBBC also requires congressional approval for a single contract in the first year for several\nyears\xe2\x80\x99 worth of procurement, however, it is more flexible for several reasons, namely:\na) There\xe2\x80\x99s no permanent statute governing the use of BBC.\nb) BBC only needs to be approved in a single appropriations act.\nc) There are no legal criteria required to qualify for a BBC (because there is no statute\ngoverning its use).\nd) A BBC can cover more than five years of planned procurement.\ne) BBCs are less likely to include cancellation penalties.\no Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) Authority16:\nThis provides the authority to allow a few select \xe2\x80\x9clong-lead\xe2\x80\x9d items to be procured in the first or\nsecond year usually for \xe2\x80\x9cbatch items\xe2\x80\x9d.\nAdvance Procurement (AP) Funding16, 22:\nThis provides the authority to disburse funds one or two years prior to the procurement of the entire\nsystem usually for long lead items for that system. The amount disbursed in an AP is subtracted from\nthe full system procurement appropriation. It is similar to EOQ acquisitions.\n\nWe recommend No-Year Funding for the Implementation phases (Phases C and D) for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s flagship\nmissions. However, there may be benefits to MYP or BBC and EOQ funding. A procurement specialist\nteam should investigate the most viable options for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s flagships.\nFunding Stability\nAs stated previously, NASA\xe2\x80\x99s budget is appropriated on an annual basis. Flagships are supposed to\nreceive an annual budget from Congress at the beginning of every fiscal year. Congress has passed a\nNASA budget on-time only 7 times in the history of NASA1. Continuing Resolutions (CRs) are the norm for\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s budgets. CRs go into effect when a budget is not passed and there is a lapse in funding. A CR\nforces a status quo budget level from the previous year, hence, a CR does not allow for an increase in\nproject budget needs. This can exacerbate a smaller funding wedge in the early years of a project\xe2\x80\x99s\ndevelopment, and can tie the hands of the project team such that they are not able to execute their planned\nschedule1.\n9\n\nIf there is inadequate, unstable funding from year to year to allow a project to execute its work on its\nplanned schedule, then the project must defer work or take on \xe2\x80\x9cunfunded\xe2\x80\x9d increased risk. Deferring work,\noriginally planned to be accomplished in early years, forces that work to be performed in later years and\ninterrupts the extremely complex, timed-developments, and well-orchestrated integrated master schedule\nthat was carefully planned at the beginning of the project. Deferment of work has a cascading and\ncompounding effect on cost and schedule implications for the remainder of a flagship\xe2\x80\x99s development. Thus,\ndeferring work will increase the development schedule, and hence will increase the overall cost to complete\nits development.\nAny one of the several full-funding policies afforded for DoD\xe2\x80\x99s large projects could fix NASA\xe2\x80\x99s flagship\nfunding stability issues of annual CRs and annual appropriations. The predictability of Congress not\npassing an annual budget has too much history, especially for a flagship project\xe2\x80\x99s nominal development\nschedule of 10-15 years. We recommend a No-Year funding policy for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s flagships.\n\nSummary:\n\nThere are multiple issues that cause NASA\xe2\x80\x99s flagships to cost more and take longer than originally\nplanned1-11, 20-21. These issues have been documented in many lessons learned publications1-17, and many\nhave been repeated multiple times. Funding stability is one of these repeated offenders. This white paper\naddressed NASA\xe2\x80\x99s flagship funding implementation/execution issues, its causes, impacts, and\nrecommendations. The reason for writing this white paper was to show that, even if NASA figured out all\nother1-17 issues (not addressed in this white paper) for why NASA\xe2\x80\x99s flagships cost more and take longer to\ndevelop, any project manager cannot deliver on cost and schedule during a flagship mission\xe2\x80\x99s development\nwithout addressing the funding issues. Given NASA\xe2\x80\x99s flagship funding dilemmas, No-Year Funding may be\nthe best full-funding vehicle option to enable the most efficient development of NASA\xe2\x80\x99s flagships that would\nfacilitate expediency of funding to overcome NASA flagship\xe2\x80\x99s current challenges. Rather than incrementally\nappropriating resources to NASA\xe2\x80\x99s flagships based on the amount of funding available in an overall \xe2\x80\x9cNASA\nwedge\xe2\x80\x9d (and not based on what the project needs) a project should be appropriated the funds when\nneeded based on the timing of the required mission developments. By explicitly acknowledging the role and\nimpact that the funding method (amount and its timing) has on a flagships development cost and schedule\nperformance, this may influence those that can take action to do so.\n\n10\n\nReferences:\n1 Martin, P., 2012, NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Challenges to Meeting Cost, Schedule, and Performance Goals, NASA Office of\nInspector General, Report No., IG-12-021.\n2 Feinberg,\n\nL., Arenberg, J., et. al., 2018, Breaking the Cost Curve: applying lessons learned from the\nJames Webb Space Telescope development to build more cost-effective large telescopes in the future.\nhttps://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20180003980.pdf\n3 Bitten,\n\nR., et. al., 2019, Challenges and Potential Solutions to Develop and Fund NASA Flagship\nMissions, IEEE, 978-1-5386-6854-2/19.\n4 Arenberg,\n\nJ., Matthews, G., et. al., 2014, Lessons We Learned Designing and Building the Chandra\nTelescope, SPIE, 9144-25.\n5 Launius,\n6 Cowen,\n\nR., & DeVorkin, D., Smithsonian Institution Scholarly Press, 2014, (Washington, DC)\n\nR., 2015, Hubble Turns 25, EOS, 96, doi:10.1029/2015EO028625.\n\n7 Wiseman,\n\nJ., 2015, The Hubble Space Telescope at 25: Lessons Learned for Future Missions,\n2015IAUGA..2258532W\n8 Werneth,\n\nR., 2001, Lessons Learned from Hubble Space Telescope Extravehicular Activity Servicing\nMissions, Goddard Space Flight Center, UMD.edu/design_lib/lCES01-2204.\n9 Mitchell,\n\nD., 2015, An Overview of NASA Project Management, MAVEN Magic, and Lessons Learned,\nNASA Goddard Space Flight Center,\nhttps://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20150009310.pdf\n10 Alban,\n\nS., 2016, 19 Lessons in Project Management Mistakes from NASA,\nhttps://blog.mavenlink.com/19-lessons-in-project-management-mistakes-from-nasa\n11 Windhorst,\n\nR., Smith, R., 2013, Lessons Learned from JWST: What is required to make Mega-Science\nProjects succeed?, http://www.asu.edu/clas/hst/www/jwst/jwsttalks/jwstlessons_aao13.pdf\n12 Birkler,\n\nJ., et. al., 2002, Options for Funding Aircraft Carriers,\nhttps://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/monograph_reports/2005/MR1526.pdf\n13 RL31404,\n\n2004-2007, Defense Procurement: Full Funding Policy \xe2\x80\x93 Background, Issues, and Options for\nCongress, https://www.everycrsreport.com/reports/RL31404.html\n14 O\xe2\x80\x99Rourke,\n\nR., 2006, Navy Ship Procurement: Alternative Funding Approaches \xe2\x80\x93 Background and Options\nfor Congress, CRS Report for Congress, RL32776. https://fas.org/sgp/crs/weapons/RL32776.pdf\n15 Lee,\n\nD., et. al., 1994, Determining a Budget Profile from a Development Cost Estimate,\nhttps://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a275864.pdf\n\n11\n\n16 O-Rourke,\n\nR., Schwartz, M., 2019, Multiyear Procurement (MYP) an Block Buy Contracting in Defense\nAcquisition: Background and Issues for Congress, R41909. https://fas.org/sgp/crs/natsec/R41909.pdf\n17 O-Rourke,\n\nR., Navy Ford (CVN-78) Class Aircraft Carrier Program: Background and Issues for Congress,\n2019.
