The cam groove receives two rollers\ncapable of exerting a larger torque and of effecting rota4 and 43 which rollers are attached, respectively, to a\ntion in more precise increments than is afforded by existfirst plunger 45 and a second plunger 47.

Thus the plungers 45 and 47 are posiare wedge shapzd, and these wedge shaped ends of the\ntioned on radial lines that form a n angle of 180 degrees\ntwo plungers alternately engage and withdraw from the\n\n\'..\n\n:IjtiZ9,48Cl\n\nminus ilj-,e half tile cii.mjnr pitch of the gcni. tecii:. 111 tke\nernbodinlent il?i~:ti.atecl in FIG. 1, the r-In? gear 49 Elas\n93 teeth with the cii-cular pitc!i being 4 c!cgr.ce:;. Each\ntoot11 55 has a lockiilg surface 71 coinciding wiib a radial\nline cf the ring gear 49 and a wedging surface 73.\nAs will *low be explained with reference to FIGS. 3\nthrough 6, clockwise rotation of the cam disk 17 causes\nalternate reciprocation of the plungers 45 and 47. The end\nwedge portions of those plungers alternately engage the\nteeth 55 of the ring gear 49 forcing the ring gear to rotate\ncounterclockwise in precise steps.\nAs shown in FIG. 3 the wedge portion of the plunger\n45 is in full engagement between two of the teeth 55 of\nthe ring gear 48 and the opposite plunger 4\'7 is entirely\ndisengaged from the teeth 55. This is the extended position of the plunger 45 and the retracted position of the\nplunger 47. FIG. 4 shows the position of the plungers 45\nand 47 after the cam disk has been rotated 60 degrees\nclockwise by the motor 29. The plunger 47 has been\npushed into initial engagement vriih the wedging face 73\nof one of the teeth 55. This movement of the plunger 47\nis caused by the section of the cam groove 39 rotating by\nthe roller 43 while gradually increasing in radial distance\nfrom the center of the cam disk from a minimum distance\nto an intermediate distance. The radial position of the cam\ngroove acting on the roller 41 was constant over this 60\ndegree clockwise movement, causing no shifting of the\nplunger 45. Therefore, after the cam disk 1 7 has rotated\n60 degrees clockwise from the starting position of FIG. 3\nthe plunger 45 remains in full engagement between two\nof the gear teeth 55 and the plunger 47 has moved half\nway toward full extension to the left.\nUpon rotation of another 60 degrees clockwise by the\ncam disk 17 (see FIG. 5 ) the plunger 45 is entirely disengaged from the teeth 55. This movement of the plunger\n45 is caused by the radial distance of the cam groove 39\nfrom the center of the cam disk gradually decreasing from\nmaximum to minimum as this portion of the cam groove\nrotated by the roller 41 attached to the plunger 45. During\nthis rotation of the cam disk 17 the portion of the cam\ngroove that rotated by the roller 43 attached to the plunger\n4\'7 did not change in radial distance from the center of the\ncam disk and the p l u n ~ e r47 did ilot move. The plunger\n47 prevents the ring gear 49 from free wheeling after the\nplunger 45 is completely disengaged therefrom.\nFIG. 6 shows the position of the plungers 45 and 47\nafter the cam disk 17 has turned another 60 degrees clockwise from the position of F I G 5 and 180 degrees clockwise\nfrom the position shown in FIG. 3. During the 60 degree\nrotation between that shown in FIG. 5 and FIG. 6, the\nportion of the cam groove 39 rotating by the roller 43 increased in radial distance from the center of the cam disk\n17 from an intermediate distance to the maximum distance thus causing the plunger 47 to extend fully to the\nleft and 10 wedge the ring gear 49 counterclockwise by\none half the circular pitch between the gear teeth 55. The\nportion of the cam groove passing by the roller 41 did not\nchange in its distance from the center of the cam disk 1 7\nand thus the plunger 45 did not move during the last GO\ndegree rotation.\nIn the position shown in FIG. 6 the pIungers 45 and 45\nhave taken opposite positions from that shown in FJG. 3\nand have ca~lsedthe ring gear 49 to move counterclockwise by a distance B which is one haif of the circalar ipitcll\nbetween the gear teeth 55. If lire cam disk 1 is\n9\nanother 180 degrees ciock\\vise the plungers 45 and 4\'.7 will\nagain reverse positrons and reinin to the pos~tronshowm\n~rt\nFIG. 3 at the b a r n 6 time forcllrg tile rrrlg geal 49\nrotate cotlnterclockwise by the distance B.\nIn order to cause the nlotor 29 (FIGS.

This switch is nct-iiniecl by a spring arm 79 having a\nroller 81 on the end thereof that follov~sa sivitch cam 83\nmounted on the cam disk 14.

The switch cam has grooiies\n87 diametrically opposed on the periphery of the switch\ncam such that when the roller 8 1 rides into the grooves\n87 the switch 77 opens thus stopping the motor 29.\nPreferably the wedge angle on the wedge face \'73 of the\ngear teeth 55 is small to insure self-locking of the ring\ngear. In the embodiment disclosed the wedge face 73\nforms a n angle of 24 degrees with the locking surface 71\nthereof, and the angle of the wedging surfaces 61 and 67\nof the respective wedge portions of the plungers 45 and 4\'7\nis 22 degrees with the respective locking surfaces 63\nand 69.\nI claim:\n1.
