A compressed spring 82 is %Cui& as by welding,\nif desimd, between the ends of the pawls opposite tbe\npin % urging the ends outwardiy against the sides\nthereby\nI\nof the groove 22. %%en the sVut extends a pmwt\npredetezmined &staxe the spring-bed& pawls 76 a d\n77 expmd into recesses 82 located on o p p d sides id the\n7\ngroove 21. l'hk stops extension of &e cygnder 1 ,laving it free to retract, however, s i c e the pawls ' 6 and\n7\n71 will be cammed out o the recesses 82 upon retractf\nb g moverneat o the cylinder.\nf\nAn enclosure 83 is providcd inside o the blight vi?f\nh i l e 1 .in alignmat with the cylinder 1 . The e n c b\n1\n7\nsure comprises a panel S7 having iQtega1ribs 89 which\nabut the inside s f the flight vehicle skh panel. Side\nwaUs 91 and an end box rib 93 are arranged around\nthe panel 87.\nWithin the enc:osure 9 is a locking pawl 95 pivotally\nconnected to a pin 97 which extends traasverstly of the\nenclosure 83. In i s focking position the 10cl;ing pawl\nt\n95 engages the toothed rack 19 through a slot 99 extending through the bottom of the groove 21 and the exterior\nskin panel of the flight vehicle. The pawl is biased\ntoward 2s locking position by a plonger 101 which is\nurged outwardly by a spring 103 contained witbin a cylk d e r 105. n e locking and udocking function ~ i the\n:\npawl 95 k controlled by an electrically operated devise\ns\n107 such as a solesoid or an electrical exploding device\nwhich when energized releases a connection 109 between the device 107 a3d an extensian I l l of the pawl\n95. The connection 239 holds +hepawl 95 in its unlocking position and when it is released the pawl is urged\ninto its locking position by the spring-urged plunger 101.\nElectrical connecths to the device lii? are made through\nan aperture 113 formed in the enc1osu:e panel 8 .\n7\nIt is understood that the locking p w l 95 is used to\nstop retraction of the cylinder 17 at the desired position\nwithin the support housing 1 . Hovfeser, when thw re5\ntraction of the cylinder 17 is pre-.dent& by the locking\npawl 95, the cylhder can still be extended wiaout disengaging the pawl from the toothed rack 19 i f sufficient\nextending force i appEed to the cyiiadcr to cause the\ns\nslanting swfaces of the toofhed rack to slide over the\npawl against tbe bias of the spring 103. his extending\nforce for postfanding prec:se kvefing of the vehicle may\nbe furnished by a jack 1x5 mounted witbin the enclosure\n83. Tbe jack 115 may be electrically operated and ampribes a pivotally mounted pawl 117 for engaging &$\ntoothed iack 19- Engagement of the pawl i 1 may be\n17\neffected by a spring-loaded plunger 1x9 which is elcctrical:y released after rhe landing operation end energy\nabsorption cycle is complete. Any se'fected landing strut\n13 may be extended for vehicle leveling by an electrical\nlinear motor 121 which drives the engzged jack 115 back\nand forth on track roaS 123 through a rack 12% E e lc\ntrical oonaections t &e motor 321 are ;lade through an\no\nopening 1 in the yaad 87.

Between this end of the\n7\npistun 33 and the plug 23, the cylinder 1 contains an\nenergy absorber which may be in the forin of a crushable\nmaterial 61 such as mstalfic honeycomb.
