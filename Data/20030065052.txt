Concepts and requirements for a Health Maintenance Facility (HMF)\nfor Space Station Freedom (SSF) have evolved through the initial phases of the\nprogram and are moving through the design reviews in preparation for fabrication.\nThe 1990 Clinical Experts Seminar provided an opportunity for a wide range of\nmedical and allied health professionals to review and comment on the plans for\nthe HMF\'.\nIt is important to note that their evaluations are based on the HMF\nconcepts that were baselined prior to the 1990-91 SSF restructure activities\nduring which the HMF capabilities were further downscoped and rephased.\n\nIn general, the consultants felt that the HMF, as baselined, offered an\nacceptable level of capabilities for SSF.\nA frequent comment was that the\nprogram would be enhanced by a clearer definition of the mission of SSF and, in\nconsequence, a clearer definition of the purpose of the HMF. It was felt that\nthere would be a significant difference in design between a facility intended\nto maintain the crew in orbit (return ill or injured crew to duty and keep the\nmission going) versus a facility designed to stabilize an ill or injured crew\nmember for transport back to Earth. It was recommended that the HMF clarify its\nmission and the level of care capabilities it expects to deliver.\nDuring the individual presentations, there were a lot of informative and\ninsightfulcomments made on avariety of issues. Some of the highlights included\ndiscussions of the management of psychiatric and psycho-social problems, methods\nof cardiovascular diagnosis, medical transport concerns, lessons learned from\nsubmarine experience, and orthopedic and ophthalmologic treatment capabilities.\nIn all cases, it was felt that common sense, simplicity and flexibility should\nbe guiding principles. Some of the specific comments included the recommendation\nthat nothing be attempted in space before it is proven as being realistic and\nfeasible on the ground. The suggestion was made that the HMF be prepared to\nhandle a variety of cardiac arrhythmias. It was recommended that orthopedic\ntreatment be kept simple and non-invasive, such that basic splinting and simple\ntractionwould suffice. A suggestionwas made that contact lenses not be allowed\non SSF due t o the resources required and the potential complications. The\ncriteria for medical transport was offered as, "when any additional delay in\ntransport would result in excessive loss of blood or severe and permanent\ndisability." The issue of nose bleeds was suggested as a primary concern. A\nprovocative discussion of possible benefits of ovulatory suppression was\npresented.\n\nAs part of the seminar, various working groups addressed a variety of issues,\none of which concerned prioritizing capabilities and stating what additional\ncapabilities should be considered. It was readily recognized that the ultimate\ndefinition of HMF level of care and capabilities would depend more on the skills\nand knowledge of the Crew Medical Officer (CMO) than on the hardware provided.\niv\n\n1\n\nL\n\n-._\n\nSome of the capabilities or resources suggested for consideration included the\nfollowing:\notic wick to assist in placement of ear drops in zero gravity\nocular decongestant drops\nthrombolytic medications\ntherapeutic soft contact lens\nTono-pen ocular tonometer\ntubular stockinette for bandaging and splinting\nthoracic extension to the cervical collar\ncatheter balloon for treating nose bleeds\nsimplified medical restraint system\nsmall, self-contained x-ray unit e.g., Lexiscope\nphysical therapy modalities e.g., methods for application of\nheat and cold, electrical stimulation units\nbio-gel, non-starch sterile gloves\nendoscopy\nintegrated computer support (with touch screen or voice\nactivation)\n\n.--\n\nSome of the capabilities that were felt to be of uncertain need included:\n\n-\n\nblood coagulation tests\ntuning fork\ninvasive orthopedic devices\n\nThere was unanimous support for requiring the capability for crew rescue and\ntransport for illness or injuries beyond the scope of the HMF. The consultants\nfound it difficult to provide a rationale for medical care that did not include\nan Assured Crew Return Vehicle (ACRV) resource and were very uncomfortable\ntrying to envision a plan for acceptable medical care without it.\nThe consultants recognized that it may not be possible to have the CMO be a\nclinically experienced physician, but, in most cases, felt that this would be\nthe preferred option. The consensus of the group was that there would be\nnumerous benefits using a physician CMO, including minimal training\nrequirements, better usage of HMF resources, more flexibility for diagnosis and\ntreatment, with improved chance of on-orbit management of medical problems and\nbetter likelihood of avoiding unnecessary transport, and high crew confidence\nin the CMO. It was felt that there were additional clinical backgrounds that\ncould be viable for the CMO, including flight nurse, paramedic, and physician\nassistant/nurse practitioner. It was noted that chronic care scenarios would\nimpose a serious challenge to the CMOS\' skills and resources, with provision of\nlong-term nursing care becoming a significant impact. The consultants agreed\nthat providing intelligent computer support on-orbit and ground consultant\nbackup through telemedicine would go a long way in rounding out and supporting\nthe CMOS\' skills and knowledge.\nThe discussion concerning imaging requirements was passionate and prolonged.\nThe surgical, internal medicine, trauma, and orthopedic specialties were\nstrongly supportive of the need for standard x-ray radiographic imaging for\nmanagement of fractures, spinal injuries, foreign body assessment, and chest\nV\n\ndisease. Several others promoted the benefits of diagnostic ultrasound for\nforeign body location and diagnosis of abdominal pain (felt to be one of the\nmore likely events). The group, as a whole, had difficulty defining medical\nsituations where imaging capability would be the deciding factor in treatment\nor transport. Everyone agreed that both x-ray and ultrasound would be desirable\nresources and that each has distinct contributions to make in providing quality\nmedical care.\nHelpful comments were made regarding the training program for the CMOS and\nground support personnel. The concept of a "CMO pool" of trained individuals\nfrom which the various mission increments could draw was proposed.\nIt was\nsuggested that the astronauts selected for the CMO role should be volunteers so\nas to insure willingness to participate in, and perform, the range of medical\ntasks required.\nA variety of training programs were presented including\nattendance in pre-established classes (medical schools, ACLS and ATLS), use of\nground and zero-gravity simulations, and computer-assisted training. In all\nareas, it was felt that the training should include a strong testing and\ncertification program at key milestones.\nThe continued use of consultants was encouraged, and thoughts were presented\nregarding the organization and maintenance of a ground consultant network\nthroughout the life of the program.\nIssues of training, certification,\ngeography and availability, motivation, and liability were discussed. One ideas\nwas to develop a core group of dedicated and knowledgeable consultants who would\nthen network with these contacts and associates to provided the needed range and\nquantity of consultants for the program.\nAt the conclusion of the seminar, the consultants expressed support and\ncontinued interest in the SSF program.\nThey were requested to provided\nadditional input and comments following the event.\nSeveral post-seminar\ncommentaries were receives and are included in the appendix of this report.\n\nvi\n\n\'\nI\n\nL\n\n..\n\n.-\n\nAGENDA\nCLINICAL EXPERTS SEMINAR\nNASSAU BAY HILTON\n\n.--\n\nMONDAY, August 2 7 t h\n8:OO\n8:30\n\n-\n\n8:30 AM\n\nRegistration\n\n10:45 AM\n\nH F Presentation & Orientation\nM\nwith Break at 9:30 AM\n\n1:OO PM\n\nTours of Space Station Freedom\nTraining Mockup and HMF Lab\n\n-\n\n11:OO\n1:OO\n\n-\n\n2:OO PM\n\nLunch (Individual Choice)\n\n2:OO\n\n-\n\n5:OO PM\n\nWorking Groups\nwith Break at 3:30 PM\n\n6:OO\n\n-\n\n7:OO PM\n\nReception (Poolside)\nDinner at Hilton (Marina Via)\n\n7:OO PM\n\nwith Guest Speaker\n\nTUESDAY, August 2 8 t h\n8:OO AM\n\n-\n\nIndividual Presentations\non Special Topics\n\n11:30 AM\n\nMorning Break\n\n9:30 AM\n11:30\n\n-\n\nLunch (Individual Choice)\n\n12~30\nPM\n\n-\n\n1 2 ~ 3 0 5:OO PM\n\n-_\n\n.-\n\nWorking Group\nwith Break at 2:30 PM\n\nWEDNESDAY, August 2 9 t h\n8:OO AM\n\nPresentations & Summaries\n\n9:30 AM\n\nMorning Break\n\nNoon\n\nAdjournment\n\nvi i\n\n1990 SPACE STATION FREEDOM\nHEALTH HAINTENANCE FACILITY\n\nClinical Expet% Seminar\n-\n\nOBJECTIVES:\n1)\n\nAcquire outside consultant input regarding the Space Station\nFreedom (SSF) Health Maintenance Facility (HMF) in a formal\nstructured manner.\n\n2)\n\nDevelop a broad base of support for HMF activities among the\nmedical community.\n\n3)\n\n--\n\nEvolve towards an operational consultant network for SSF\nmedical operations.\n\n--\n\nASSl/!fk\'TIONS: As you consider the various issues and questions regarding the\nHMF, there are certain baseline assumptions which you should keep in mind.\na.\n\nThe primary functions of the HMF are prevention, diagnosis,\ntreatment (includlng dental and hyperbarics) and transport.\nThe level of care will be that of a remote medical facility\nwith transport capabilities.\n\nb.\n\nHMF capabilities will include routine simple care for all\ncrewmembers up to prolongedintensive care of one seriously-ill\nor injured crewmember for up to 14 days. The anticipated crew\nduty cycle will be 90 days with a possibility of 180 days.\n\nc.\n\nThere will be a rescue vehicle capability Assured Crew Return\nVehicle (ACRV) , and there will be telemedicine capabilities\n(ability to communicate voice and visual with ground\nconsultants.)\n\nd.\n\nThere are serious weight, volume, and power constraints on the\nHMF facility. Therefore, it needs to be kept as simple and\nmulti-functional as possible.\n\ne.\n\nThe Crew Medical Officer (CMO) may, or may not, be a physician.\nAt the least, the CMO will be trained to an EMT level of skill\nand knowledge. (There is currently a request in the system\nto have the CMO be a physician.)\n\nC\n\nL\n\nviii\n\n.\n\nPARTICIPANTS\n\n.-. *.\n-\n\nJohn Rock, M.D.\nGynecologist\nThe John Hopkins Hospital\n\nAlfred B o d , M.D., Ph.D.\nCardiology Section\nDepartment of Internal Medicine\nTemple University\n\nSam Scheinberg, M.D.\nOrthopedic Specialist\n\nKim Broadwell, M.D.\nDivision of Occupational\n& Environmental Medicine\nDuke University Medical Center\n\nDouglas Stetson, M.D., USN\nUSN Submarine Research\nNaval Submarine\nMedical Research Laboratory\n\nMark Campbell, M.D.\nGeneral Surgeon\nHoward Donner, M.D.\nWilderness Medicine\n\nCharles M.

The presentations were done alphabetically and are documented here by\nindividual.\n1-\n\nPresenter: Alfred BovB, M.D.\n\n..\nI\n\nTopic:\n\nCard1 ovascul ar D i sease and Management Consi derati ons\nfor Space Station Freedom\n\nI would like to spend amoment talking about cardiovascular disease. The average\nage for space station astronauts is 4 0 ; since the average age is 4 0 , there will\nbe people above the age of 40. As time goes on with senior scientists and other\nexperts, you might have some people in their fifties, and cardiac diseases\nprobably need to be considered from several different points of view. I would\nbreak them down anatomically.\n\n.,\n1\n\nI would start with coronary vascular disease. With the population of people\nover 40 years old and given that we cannot screen everybody who is going to the\nspace station with coronary angiography, there is probably going to be someone\non a flight that has asymptomatic coronary disease at the time they leave. With\nthe prolonged flight times, someone will manifest coronary disease while they\nare in flight. Angina may develop, for example, and there are several strategies\none can use to stabilize angina. It is not a lethal disease and could be easily\nmanaged. Medications that are onboard will allow one to deal with angina, but\nsomeone should be aware that the diagnosis must be made and a strategy developed\nto treat unstable angina and rule out myocardial infarction.\nIt would be\nimportant to have the enzyme analysis capabilities on the space station because\nCK-MB measurements would be the key to making the diagnosis along with the 12\nlead EKG capabilities.\nI think both of those should be there. The other\nquestion is what do you do if someone has an acute myocardial infarction? I\'m\nconvinced from clinical experience that there are many people who have no prior\nmanifestations until their very first infarction. Half of the patients with outof-hospital infarcts die of their infarction. In hospitals, the mortality rate\nis now around six to eight percent, and I think if you are going to provide\noptimal therapy you would have someone give thrombolytic therapy on the space\nstation. It is safe for a healthy adult, and it would reverse the infarct and\npotentially reduce the complications that occur during the early infarct period.\nI would be very comfortable to take someone with an uncomplicated, inferior\ninfarct, treat them for a week, and put them back to duty because that is what\nwe normally do with somebody who has an uncomplicated, inferior infarct who has\nleft ventricular functional compromise. This infarct is usually benign and the\ngreat majority of people survive it. I think we need to consider strategies,\nif it occurs in the middle of a mission, for a person who has an infarct and does\nnot have failure or angina. If it is uncomplicated, they should be able to go\n1\n\nback to duty in about seven to eight days, or light duty for a week or two, with\nfull duty after about two to three wezks. I don\'t think everybody with an acute\ninfarct would have to be evacuated. On the other hand, if someone had a large\nanterior infarct and went into congestive heart failure, we would have to\nconsider other strategies for not only stabilizing that individual, but then\ndeciding whether or not he needs to be transferred. Again, remember those\npatients who survive the initial occlusion of the artery usually recover if they\nget past the first twenty-four hours and usually get back to some kind of\nactivity even if they have been in heart failure during the early period. So\nthe question is: if we get the person stable, could we ride him through, put\nhim on light duty and wait for a shuttle to take him home rather then send him\nback on a relatively traumatic and stressful individual flight?\nThere are some other interesting questions.\nI was trying to imagine what\npulmonary edema would sound like through a stethoscope in a zero gravity\nenvironment. I don\'t think you would get basal rales; in fact, my guess is that\nyou wouldn\'t get any rales, because normally in one-G if you have basal rales,\nit means that the pressure in mid-lung is about 20 cm of water. You get another\n10 at the base which gets you 30, and 30 is the starting number which causes\ncongestion at the bases. So, if the central lung pressure is 20, because of\nelevated left ventricular end diastolic pressure, then my guess is that you\nwouldn\'t have any rales at all even though there was heart failure. So there\'s\nan interesting dilemma. You raised the question about a right heart catheter.\nIf you\'re really concerned about heart failure, it might be the only way to find\nout because I don\'t think a physical exam will be helpful. Neck vein extension\nis not going to help you. You are in a zero gravity environment that gives you\ncontinuous vein distention which is not helpful. So, I think if it really got\ndown to the issue of does this patient have heart failure or not, we would have\nto measure intravascular pressures because I don\'t think a physical exam would\nbe reliable enough. There is no dependency phenomenon in the space environment,\nso that\'s not going to be helpful. The patient won\'t get edema either unless\nthe failure is severe and prolonged. So you won\'t see ankle edema until heart\nfailure is severe.\nSince there is space to spare, a balloon catheter for\nmeasuring intravascular pressures would be a good idea. I would argue that\nthere ought to be a physician on most flights, but I think we ought to have a\nfloatable right heart catheter in the space station. Will it float into the\npulmonary artery? I think it will because the majority of force that move a\nballoon-directed catheter are fluid generated forces and not gravity generated,\nso I think it will overcome the zero gravity effect. I noticed that the\nexternal pacemaker was listed in there. We do just as well with the new venous\nfloatable pacemaker. Sometimes you put a pacemaker in when you don\'t really want\nto and this could result in an infected pacemaker in the heart for a long time.\nYou might want to include a balloon floatable pacemaker in case you must pace\nsomebody for a week if they\'ve had an infarct. It is really not very comfortable\nto have prolonged external packing.\nIt is basically like an external shock\nthrough all the chest muscles; it\'s good for a short time\nhalf an hour/45\nminutes while you\'re putting another catheter in. A balloon floatable pacing\nwire in the kit would be worthwhile in that it would not subject a person needing\na pacemaker to two weeks of external pacing. It is very uncomfortable. So, from\nthe standpoint of coronary disease, I think we have to develop the strategy of:\nfor an uncomplicated infarct or unstable angina, thrombolytic therapy in all\nfairness to the individual. I mean, certainly, you\'re going to gamble pretty\n\n-\n\n2\n\n8-\n\n-\n\n...\n\nsoon. It\'s not like the astronaut is 20 miles away from you and you can\'t get\nto him for four hours .for thrombolysis. It is reasonable to take someone with\nan uncomplicated infarct and treat them; you could even rehab them. You have\nall the equipment. You could go through a whole cardiac rehab program and put\nthem back to work. That would be a question I think we need to ask. In the area\nof valvular heart disease, I don\'t think we\'re going to send anyone up there that\nhas overt valvular heart disease. The screening process should take care of\nthat, but I can imagine that somebody who has a superficial infection could get\nendocarditis. That would be one very remote possibility, but if somebody got\nendocarditis, the diagnosis would have to be made. It\'s hard to make a diagnosis\nwithout a blood culture; there\'s no easy way to do it. I don\'t know if you are\nprepared to do blood cultures up there. Endocarditis is a serious disease. If\nsomebody is untreated for 90 days, they would be in real trouble, so a diagnosis\nmust be made. The other problem is that you could perforate a valve and develop\nheart failure, but this would be rare. I would not be concerned about valvular\nheart disease problems. Someone could sustain heavy chest trauma and rupture\nthe aortic valve.\nI can\'t imagine these high energy injuries in this\nenvironment. I don\'t think we will get much of an opportunity to get the type\nof high impact injuries that we would get in a motorcycle or automobile accident\nor plane crash. So I wouldn\'t worry too much about valvular heart disease. As\nfar as rhythm and conduction abnormalities, I really think we are going to find\nsome atrial arrhythmias in space. The reasons are twofold: one is that there\nis a central fluid shift so the atria are distended on a long-term basis, and\nthe other is that young people (even healthy young people) tend to get\nsupraventricular tachycardia for a variety of reasons. Some of them have occult\nconducting bundles; pre-excitation accessory bundles may not be obvious. Others\njust get atrial irritation from too much stress, not enough sleep, maybe too much\ncoffee all of those trigger atrial rhythm. At some point in the space station\nprogram, there is going t o b e someone who goes into supraventricular tachycardia.\nThe question is, "What do you do about it?" The drugs that are available to\ntreat these rhythms should be stocked. That would be important, and there is\na synchronized defibrillator so that one could use this for application. In the\nspace environment, I would initially go through a drug regimen to try to convert\nthe rhythm. It might even be easier to control the atrial fibrillation with\ndrugs and put the person back to duty in atrial fibrillation rather than try to\ncardioversion. That would be one judgmental decision that would have to be made\non the ground. The concern is that if you go into atrial fibrillation, you could\nget a thrombus in the atrium and when they are cardioverted have a stroke. I\'d\nrather have somebody with chronic AFib than somebody who gets a stroke up there\non the space station during attempted cardioversion. One would have to be\ncapable of anti-coagulating with coumadin which is a benign therapy, but requires\nthe ability to do a PT every once in a while. I think PT analysis is built into\nthe whole coagulation group. I would, for one, like to have the capability of\ndealing with atrial fibrillation including the possibility of keeping it as\natrial fib and treating the individual with digoxin and maybe verapamil to keep\nthe rhythm stable, anti-coagulating the individual, and putting himback to duty.\nAgain, that\'s quite possible, and I wouldn\'t be concerned about somebody who has\na PT of 17-18 seconds with atrial fibrillation who has slow ventricular rate.\nI wouldn\'t send them out to run marathons, but, basically, for work inside, it\nwouldn\'t create a problem. I was interested in the comment regarding Halogen\nbecause this substance produced ventricular arrhythmias in 11 percent of the\nsubjects.\n\n-\n\n3\n\nIn reference to general disease, there .e two issues I brought up. One was\n.\nr\nmitral valve prolapse; some people who have mitral valve prolapse and mitral\nregurgitation can tear a chordae and go into acute congestive heart failure\nsituation. I would screen people with echo not to find trivial mitral valve\nprolapse, but anybody who has severe mitral valve prolapse with regurgitation\nmight be excluded from flight.\n\nI include patent foramen ovale as a concern because it is a controversial issue\nright now. In diving, there is some real concern about patent foramen ovale\nbecause of aggravation of decompression sickness, converting it from a relatively\nminor process into a cerebral process. In my own mind, based on the diving\nexperience, I would be able to justify screening the astronauts to determine\nwhether they had patent foramen ovale, and those that did, I would limit their\nEVAs in particular. Because I think many of the EVAs would produce bubbles.\nI think we would have an increased risk of cerebral complications from the\nbubbles. I wouldn\'t exclude them from participation altogether; I would just\nexclude them from prolonged WAS.\nThe fact is that we have done an entire protocol for cardiac rehab which revolves\naround that topic, so what you do is a submax stress test at seven days, a lowgrade to determine if there is severe ischemia. If there is ischemia after a\nseven day treadmill test, I think that might be a reason to send a patient back.\nIf there is no severe ischemia, you could use the tolerance level that was\nachieved on the exercise treadmill. You have the whole system available to give\nhim an exercise prescription based on his pulse rate and let him go back to work.\nWatch his pulse rate and make certain it stays below the threshold that you\'ve\ndetermined and then at eight or nine weeks, repeat the stress test going for a\nfull maximum stress test, and if he passes that then he could go back to duty.\nHe should avoid very heavy exercise, but I would say that he could do most of\nthe inside work.\n\n4\n\nINDIVIDUAL\n\nPresenter:\n\n.\'-\n\nTopic:\n\nPRESENTATIONS\n\nKim Broadwell, M.D.\n\nHMF Mission Profile and the Need for Diagnostic Laboratory\n\nEquipment, Chronic Nutrition and Blood Transfusions\nOne problem that has confounded me for years in being associated with the HMF\nis this: there\'s always been so many options to the mission.\nThey can\'t tell\nus anything about the evacuation possibilities of an ACRV or what we used to\ncall CERV. As long as we don\'t have information on how long somebody might be\nstuck up there before the shuttle comes, it\'s really tough to balance the\ndifferent parts of the HMF to meet the mission. The HMF has always had, from\nthe overall mission point of view, the chief benefit of keeping somebody on\nstation that might otherwise have to be evacuated.\nDuring initial HMF\ndevelopment, we tried to weight the HMF more heavily towards diagnostic than\ntherapeutic modalities. We were talking yesterday about remote health care here\non Earth in such areas as Northern Canada and Alaska. It may cost $20 to $50,000\nto be overly conservative and evacuate somebody from the Northwest territories\nthat didn\'t need to be evacuated. But when you\'re talking about bringing a\ncrewmember back from space who is clinically borderline, that\'s a real big deal,\nnot just in money, but in public relations too. It is wise to be as certain as\nyou can. I tend to agree that, if at all possible, you want to leave hardware\nlike swan ganz in the system, if only to be able to get a normal value. It is\nimportant to feel you are dealing with a condition that is not deteriorating and\nwill cause an evacuation. This is of great value not only to that person, but\nalso the space program.\nMy questions for discussion were scattered across several areas that I have had\nparticular experience with. One was about laboratory microbiology examinations\n- which ones do I feel are absolutely required, and why. I think I\'ll skip the\n"why" part and just tell you "which" ones. The way that the Systems Requirements\nDocument reads now is comprehensive. We finally threw out some of the very\nexotic tests. I think it\'s important if we\'re going to have somebody who might\nhave an infection to be able to do at least a gram stain. Other tests are\nincluded that you might not need but once in a blue moon. However, when the\nquestion comes up, you really want to know.\n\nI -\n\n.\n\nThe tests that most likely might raise arguments are the multiplicity of tests\nfor each organ system. When the decision must be made to evacuate somebody\nwithin a day or so, you want to be able to assess the severity of the situation.\nThe less clinically-skilled your crew medical officer, the more objective data\nrequire by "remote experts." I believe you need to leave in most of the clinical\nchemistry tests particularly since there is not a major increase in overhead once\nyou have the machine to do one liver function. We don\'t necessarily need three\nliver functions, but at least one test for each organ system. The overhead there\nis just going to be how much storage space it takes for reagents and test kits.\n\n5\n\nI expressed my big concern yesterday for microbiology i.e., that this system has\nnot been emphasized. My concern about station is that if it ever is abandoned,\nit is going to be because of some kind of environmental problem that can\'t be\ncleared up i.e., bioslime in the water or a toxic problem that just can\'t be\nmanaged. I think from an environmental health point of view, that system needs\na very complete microbiological capability.\nWe don\'t have that many antibiotics and I think most infections will probably\nbe treated empirically just as we do down here, From a medical point of view,\nI\'m not sure I can justify a lot of heavy microbiological capability for the HMF\nalone. I think that\'s going to be there already because of the EHS.\nI\'m not ready to speak on the automated culture sensitivity development that\'s\ngoing on at this time, but I think whatever they have for their environmental\nmonitoring will probably suit us pretty well, There\'s no sense in having a\npanel of 27 antibiotic sensitivities when we can carry only 3 or 4 antibiotics\nin the pharmacy.\nThe medical certification of flight hardware issue has been a vexing one from\nway back in the days when we first started looking at making sterile water on\nstation. As Dr. Boyce mentioned yesterday, I think the rest of the agencies are\nwilling to give NASA exemption and not worry about it as long as we only use\nthis equipment on orbit. If we want to use it for clinical trials on people,\nI know we went to great effort to get the CDRH\nthat\'s another matter.\nexemption, for the x-ray machine (DRIS), as Lou Wagner is familiar with. The\nFDA has up to this point said, "Do what you want to do with your IV stuff on\nyour astronaut in orbit."\n\n.\n\nThe program surely does not want to have another Hubble Telescope type problem.\nThese items do need a test plan. You can probably do that without clinical\ntesting because none of the technology for the HMF is so new and wonderful that\nthere will be a question about the underlying approach. In the case of the\nwater, you can do definitive studies and do a test like the planned Spacelab S U\nexperiment. The spacelab issues are ones that ground testing cannot answer.\nI never thought that it was feasible that NASA had the resources to do a fullup FDA type medical certification. Now if you\'re lucky, one of the companies\nthat is doing your work may think that your model is commercially viable.\nSomething like the Clinical Lab Analyzer Medical Development Unit could go into\nthat they take MDU\'s forward\nproduction. That\'s always been our secret wish\nfor certification.\n\n-\n\nEach instrument needs to be looked at individually. In general, the changes\nthat the safety people make you do to fly these instruments don\'t change the\nfunction remarkably.\nOne of the other fears in station about medical\ninstrumentation is the software. Anytime you go in there and diddle with the\nsoftware, you really do need a very extensive testing program to make sure that\nthe software in an analyzer or IV pump, whatever little microchips control the\ninstrument, are really checked-out. That\'s possibly where we will come up with\nmore problems than a valve failing, because of the space software control\nfailure.\n\n6\n\n.-\n\n*-\n\n-\n\n..\n1\n\nThe final question for discussion was the approach to blood transfusions and\nchronic nutritional support. When my work at NASA started, I was looking at the\nparenteral nutrition issues, and I went into it about as far as I could in 1985.\nAccording to my little Lotus spreadsheet, if you wanted to do a good job of\nparenteral nutrition on somebody for even 2-3 weeks you were going to need your\nown HMF logistics module for maximally dehydrated dextrose, amino acids and 30%\nliquid emulsions. When we speak of surgically managing some awful problem that\nyou might expect to happen on a Mars mission or a Lunar Base, I think you\'re\ngoing to need this capability.\nBut for the time being, certainly, total\nparenteral nutrition is, just from the weight and volume point of view, very\ndifficult logistically. Additionally, there is the issue of a central line plus\nall the other administration aspects which go along with it. It puts a heavy\nburden on your lab, obviously. Most of the serious things are going to be\nmanaged in the first couple of hours; they aren\'t going to do well after that.\nYou can make up scenarios, but it will be tough to make a real fair one that\ndemonstrates a need for TPN on early station.\nThe peripheral nutrition issue is a little more difficult, and there I find\nmyself going in a circle. Yes, it would be nice to have some liquids, but that\'s\nglass; it\'s tough to take glass; it\'s heavy. I think if you can take a little\nbit of safe lipid solution, that is a good idea. A lot of folks have talked\nabout it, using enteral nutrition when some of the crew might not feel well for\na couple of days. With enteral nutrition, you have some intestinal gut problems\ne.g., diarrhea or loose stools, that are going to aggravate your general issues\nof biohazards altogether. Medical biowaste, in general, is one of my other\nconcerns, all the trash that an ICU patient is going to generate. I\'m not sure\nthe program has ever come to grips with how much garbage is going to come out\nof these people.\n\nSo watery diarrhea is something that you are not going to want the people to\nhave either. If you are only going to be aiming for a period of ten days where\nan ill crewmember is going to have to make it or not make it, supplemental\nnutrition will not help a seriously ill person much over this period. They are\ngoing to start out healthy, and I think most of them will make it without a lot\nof weight and volume in HMF for nutritional support.\n\n-\n\n?\n\nI have tried to follow developments in that field. There\nBlood Transfusions\nagain, most of the current uses of blood are pretty conservative. If you have\na problem that\'s surgical and is not going to go away without surgery, then all\nthe blood in the world isn\'t going to make any difference. I can see some\nscenarios where you need blood and maybe a warm transfusion from the crew in the\nhab module would make a difference. We all had great hopes for hemoglobin and\noxygen carrying substitutes which haven\'t panned out too well. I\'m not sure\nthat reprocessed hemoglobin is going to turn out to be clinically useful and\ncertainly the perfluorocarbons have gotten stalled. Some of these would require\nfreezing anyway, and we don\'t have a lot of freezer space for them. I think for\nthe HMF configuration that we\'re talking about first time around, probably warm\nblood transfusion is the best you can hope for. You might just want to know in\nadvance what the blood types of the people are even if you can\' t influence having\nenough ABO-compatible crew to transfuse. Thanks.\n\n7\n\nINDIVIDUAL PRESENTATIONS\n\na\n\nPresenter:\nfl-\n\n.\n\nTopic:\n\nHark Campbell, H.D.\n\nGeneral Surgical Capabilities f o r HMF and the "Imp1 ications"\non Crew Medical Officer (CMO) Training, X-Rays and Wound Healing\n\nThe general surgical capabilities of the HMF will be severely limited and it\'s\nnot due to limitations of hardware, consumable supplies, or even on development\nof procedures in zero-G. But it\'s going to be limited due to the capability of\nthe Crew Medical Officer, and you know we\'re not going to have a general surgeon\nor anybody with surgical experience, so that immediately eliminates things like\nvascular repair and major abdominal surgery unless you\'re in pretty dire straits.\nI think it\'s really important for the remaining surgical capability as to how\nmuch clinical capability that CMO has and I feel it will change quite a bit\nwhether its EMT versus an M.D. We are going to have the capabilities to do some\nthings like place chest tubes, and hopefully put in central line, close some\nlacerations, do peritoneal lavage and even an appendectomy and you will need to\nhave that capability. I think that\'s going to be real difficult if the CMO is\nnot an M.D.\n\nI think training is going to be real important whether the CMO is an M.D. or\nnot. Whatever decision is made on that or whatever happens, I think it\'s\nimportant that whether it\'s an M.D. or not, some method should be worked out\nwhere he will receive some training in real life situations and is able to put\nin several chest tubes, close several lacerations, and put in as many central\nlines as possible. And I think that can certainly be worked out. If you just\nthink back about what it was like when you put in your first chest tube or what\nwas it like putting in your fourth one, even most of those simple procedures\nhave a fairly quick learning curve and just by doing it a few times, I think it\nwill be extremely beneficial.\n\ni"\n\nThe second thing I want to discuss is the importance of x-ray, and we had a\ngreat discussion in our group about this and there was some controversy. My own\npersonal feeling is that it is pretty critical that we have x-ray capabilities.\nIt makes orthopedic decisions, I think, real difficult and, certainly, any kind\nof chest injury whether its pulmonary contusion or pneumothorax, you are going\nto have a lot of difficulty if you don\'t have x-ray capabilities. The more\nuntrained, or inexperienced, I should say, your CMO is then the more important\nit is going to be. You know the function of the HMF\', as I see it, is to maintain\nto keep them at a high degree of function. If\nthe health of the astronauts\nyou have somebody with neck pain and you don\'t know if they have a cervical\ninjury or not and you\'re going to have to put them in a cervical collar for two\nweeks because you don\'t know what they have, then I don\'t really think that\'s\nmaintaining their health.\n\n-\n\n9\n\nc\n\nI\'ll just say a few things about wound healing. You know there has been some\nfairly good evidence that the immune response in weightlessness is dxreased.\nIt hasn\'t been very well defined, but certainly there are indications that is\ntrue, so I think that you\'re going to have an altered host response. I think\nthe chances of your having a wound infection may be a little bit greater than\ndown here in 1-G. Also we already realize, and I\'m not sure how many people do\nrealize this, that the air will be fairly contaminated on an on-going basis.\nThe particle count and the colony forming units per cubic foot is about 100\ntimes higher than what it is in this room, and I think that is definitely going\nto have some bearing on wound infection. Nobody knows how much, but I think\ncertainly it will have some and be sort of a reverse from the laminar flow\nsituation.\nThe Russians have performed some animal experimentation when they have taken up\nanimals (I believe rabbits) and made incisions and looked at wound healing, and\nthere is definitely delayed wound healing. Their observational and scientific\npapers indicate that it is very definite, even by so much as a factor of two.\nThis issue certainly is going to have to be explored at some point and may be\nquite critical.\nNobody knows the mechanism of this, however; it\'s very\npreliminary.\nA lot of people talk about the problem of the containment of bleeding in zeroG and there\'s a lot of worry and discussion about it. Lots of methods have been\ndevised to try to limit that from laminar flow devices to inflatable surgical\nchambers\nthere are many different methods. All I can say is that I don\'t\nthink anybody really knows how big of a problem that will be whether it will be\na big problem or a small one. That\'s all I have.\n\n-\n\nOuestion: Lou Wanner\n\nI have a couple of question regarding x-rays. Is there any discussion as to\nwhat level of sophistication for x-ray capability. Did you have any discussion\nas to how far you want to go in that?\nI don\'t think CAT Scan is that important, and although ultrasound would be nice,\nI don\'t think it\'s that important. To me, all I want is just a simple x-ray.\nI think a chest x-ray is real important and I think orthopedic x-rays would help\na great deal in making a lot of decisions about whether you are going to evacuate\nsomebody, whether you can treat somebody. There are many fractures you can treat\non Station. And there are several fractures you can not treat on Station, and\nthe only way you can make that decision is with using x-ray. I think you\'re\ngoing to have a lot of unnecessary evacuations (maybe not on the ACRV) but at\nleast to bring the shuttle up and take them down that might be unnecessary. And\ncertainly it would degrade crew performance. You will have to over-treat, and\nthis will decrease crew performance if you don\'t have that.\n\n10\n\n.- .\n\nOuestion:\n\nLou Wanner\n\n*\n\nWhat about the ultrasound in terms of internal soft tissue trauma or something\nof that nature for which x-ray may not be suited.\n\nt\n\nWell ultrasound is not great on that either. It\'s real good for pelvic; it\'s\nreal good for looking at things like renal stones which will be real important\nand even cholelithiasis which, who knows, cholelithiasis may be a problem. We\njust don\'t know.\n\nI -\n\n11\n\nINDIVIDUAL\n\nPRESENTATIONS\n\n*,\n\nPRESENTER:\n\nHoward Donner , M. D.\n\n1\n\nTopic:\nr -\n\n-.\n4\n\nAppl ication o f Wilderness Medicine and Mountaineering\nto HMF Capabilities\n\nI\'ll say a few words, slightly different from Dr. Campbell\'s, on the x-ray. My\nbackground is essentially in family and emergency medicine, but in essence,\nwilderness medicine. I do a lot of expeditionary support where I have very\nlittle technology to work from for the little bit of medical gear I stick in my\npack before I leave.\nThe question which Roger initially asked me was, "Could you function without\nstandard radiographic imaging?" I thought long and hard about that, and my\nfeeling is this. For abdominal trauma, flat plates, and uprights are used\nextensively in the emergency department.\nRealistically, they are seldom\ndiagnostic, and that\'s at one G! In zero gravity, with the loss of diagnostic\nair/fluid level which is usually what we are looking for, I feel we could get\nby without abdominal films. The bigger questions, as Dr. Campbell already\nalluded to, is, "What about C-spine?" Well, in the majority of cases in the\nemergency department much information can be gleaned from the history and\nphysical exam.\nClearly any patient with a history of cervical trauma who\ncomplains of neck pain or neurologic deficit is at high risk and radiologic\nevaluation would be indicated.\nHowever, most C-spine studies done in the emergency room are to evaluate patient\nwith attendant levels of consciousness due to head trauma, alcohol or drugs.\nThese conditions are less likely in the space station environment.\nIn the conscious patient, without C-spine tenderness to palpitation, fracture\nis highly unlikely. Despite this argument, C-spine radiologic evaluation would,\nin rare circumstances, be veryhandy i.e., specifically to avoid the unnecessary\nimmobilization of a crew member with a suspicious injury over a potentially\nlengthy period.\n\n.a\n\nI believe that probably in 99.95 of the cases, one could function without Cspine evaluation. I think the area where it is extremely difficult to imagine\nfunctioning without (I agreed, certainly, with Dr . Campbell) radiographic\ncapability is for chest injury and pulmonary processes. I have spent a lot of\ntime in the mountains diagnosing pulmonary edema without the use of radiographic\nequipment. This can usually be done clinically i.e., increasing shortness of\nbreath, productive cough, rales and progressive arterial desaturation (cyanosis\nor falling Sa02). I don\'t know how prevalent rales will be in zero gravity;\nhowever, usually the diagnosis of pulmonary edema, pneumonitis, infectious\nprocesses, etc. can be made empirically on clinical grounds alone. What I worry\nabout is pneumothorax and that would be very, very difficult to diagnose. A\npatient who presents with shortness of breath and significant chest pain has\n\n13\n\npneumothorax or some other pulmonary process. The auscultatory findings in\npneumothorax are subtle, and with the ambient noise level of the space station\nenvironment, forget it.\nOrthopedics is another issue. I agree with Dr. Campbell that it would be very\nnice for orthopedic diagnosis.\nAgain, if you utilize the mountaineering\nexperience, most often one can assess and treat fairly appropriate without\nradiographic imaging. A thorough clinical exam is performed and if fracture is\nsuspected, the extremity is splinted or casted. The worst case scenarios on\nspace station would be the undiagnosed angulation or displacement. Under these\nconditions, the crewmember would potentially need surgical revision at a later\ndate, but that should be acceptable. There are many orthopedic processes which\nrequire specific splinting. Certainly in the mountaineering circuit, most of\nthe time, one can assess and treat fairly appropriately evenwithout radiographic\nimaging. That would be certainly enough to get that person down where if, in\nfact, the worst case scenario was to occur and that was whether or not there was\na fracture dislocation with some ambulation or it was a displacement that was\nmissed, clinically, at least that could be attended to surgically later. So,\nagain, I\'m not suggesting that it would be nice to work up in the space station\nwithout radiographic equipment. But to answer the question, "Could I function?\'\'\nI think in most of the cases I could function. I would like to add that we have\naddressed the idea of a Lexiscope, which is essentially a small format\nfluoroscopic technique. There should be continued dialogue, if the DRIS unit\nis not to be utilized, on a smaller, lighter weight, perhaps less functional,\nbut still useable radiographic imaging device. Even though it\'s very small, long\nbone images could be mosaiced to form a complete picture. Admittedly, for Cspine injury, pulmonary and abdominal processes, it would probably be fairly\nworthless.\n\nOn the microbiology laboratory, I think that\'s already been addressed. I think\nthe bottom line is whether we believe microbiology is necessary or not. Most\nof that microbiological capability will be utilized by the EHS. As far as a\nminimum from my standpoint goes, I think obviously we need microscopic\ncapabilities to direct the initial treatment of infectious disease processes\ni.e., gram stained sputum, spun urine, stool leukocytes, etc. I think that\'s\na given for what needs to be available.\nAs far as the Safe Haven goes, NASA already has an incredible kit (my specialty\nis preparing medical kits for expeditions), and I have had the chance to go\nthrough the SOMS Kit which is the current shuttle orbital medical system in use.\nIt is an incredible system, and I think that if the space were available,\nsomething similar to a SOMS Kit stuffed into the corner of space station would\nbe a reasonable way to go. Assuming that space is not available for a complete\nSOMS Kit, I guess the question is what kinds of medical gear, etc. would be\nmandatory for Safe Haven. Addressing this as I would on a mountaineering trip,\nI would say just a very few things. Obviously you need first aid gear for\nsplinting and for taking care of soft tissue injuries (your very basic first aid\nkit). Additionally, I would say a very small array of injectable medications,\nand when I say injectable, I\'m talking about IM, not IV capabilities.\n\n14\n\nThe list of injectables would include:\na)\nb)\nc)\nd)\ne)\n\nf)\n\n.\n\n* *\n\n3\n\ng)\n\na potent, injectable narcotic pain reliever\nnarcan for overzealous administration of item a)\nepinephrine for anaphylactic reactions\ndecadron for treatment for hyperbaric hypoxia complications (i.e.,\nhigh altitude cerebral edema)\nlidocaine for local anesthesia\nbroad spectrum antibiotic (a third generation cephalosporin such as\nrocephin, with a long half-life\nan anti-emetic such as phenergan or compazine\n\nAdditionally, I would include a few oral medications including:\na)\nb)\nc)\nd)\n\nlots of NSAIDs such as naprosyn for mild pain and musculoskeletal\nconditions\nbroad spectrum antibiotic such as cipro\noral narcotic pain reliever such as percocet\nsmall suture kit\n\nAnd, finally, a multi-use splint such as the SAM.\n\nWhat would you take if you had more room than the SOMS Kit? Would you use that\nspace up, and if so, how would you use it up?\nAs far as carrying additional medical gear, then I would consider including some\nIV capabilities. I would probably include enough fluid to trauma resuscitate\n(it\'s hard to say how much because it would depend upon the trauma), but enough\nto initially stabilize one patient from a traumatic episode. How much? I don\'t\nknow! But I would say a good start would be six liters or so, along with some\nblood tubing and pressure infusion devices. I might also include something like\na Kendrick traction device. The reason for this is because following major\ntrauma, specifically fractured femur, oftentimes, there is not enough fluid to\nfully resuscitate one of these patients. We\'re talking about long transport\ntimes back to Earth and I think we can do a l o t to s t a b i l i z e t h i s patient\nhemodynamically just by applying a simple femoral traction system.\n\n-\n\n\'I\n\n.\n\n4\n\nWhen you build this capability for SOMS and Safe Haven and start with a crev of\neight, would you go in with the point of departure dealing with that one person,\nor are you looking at an emergency situation with multiple injuries? How would\nyou approach it if you have multiple injuries, or a single injury?\nThat\'s a good question. On an expedition, I normally assume that only one\nclimber will be seriously injured, and that\'s usually how I pack in terms of\nmajor trauma. The problem with space station is certainly toxic exposure i.e.,\na number of inhalation injuries or thermal injuries secondary to an explosion\ndealing with multiple trauma patients. If you\'re asking me to extrapolate from\nthe mountaineering experience, safe haven should have the capability to do a\n\n15\n\nbang-up job on a single individual. These are tough decisions and very difficult\nto predict. It is h e m i c fantasy to assume we will be able to provide for any,\nand all, contingencies.\n\n.-\n\n_-\n\n16\n\nINDIVIDUAL PRESENTATIONS\nSpeaker: David Jones, H.D.\nTopic:\n*-\n\nc.l\n\nPsychiatric Issues - Comnunications and Support\nRequirements During Crises\n\nWhen I was sent the information about this meeting, I dug into the boxes in my\ngarage and got some stuff from 1985 when the Air Force asked me similar\nquestions. The only question you left out was, "What do you do with POWs in\nspace?" So I will skip that and go along to the others.\nI\'m going to start by telling you Jones\' "Pancake Rule," because this was very\nhelpful in dealing with the Air Force when some of these questions came up. I\nfound myself thinking, as I usually do, in parables, call it parabolic thinking\nif you want. When I was a young father and had two sons in the Boy Scouts, we\nhad to go out on camping trips and do things. One of the things they had to do\nbefore they could make Second Class was to prepare a meal which I had to eat;\nthat was my contribution. The meal was breakfast, and the menu was pancakes.\nThey came to me with what purported to be a pancake. I can\'t tell you what it\nlooked like, I\'ll just tell you how it came to be. I looked at this object and\nsaid, "What did you bring?" And they said, "Well, we brought pancake mix." And\nI said, "No syrup?" "No." "No butter?" "No." "No milk?" "No." They did have\nwater. So I had pancake mix and water cooked by a 12 and a 13 year old over a\ncampfire, and it was just about what you think it was. And that was breakfast,\nno orange juice, coffee or anything else. On closer inquiry, it turned out that\nthey had never cooked pancakes before, so I passed a law right then and there\non the spot. Being a father, you have to do that once in a while. They would\nnever again prepare a meal in the woods until they had cooked it in a kitchen.\nSo Jones\' "Pancake Rule" for space physiological research is: Don\'t expect that\nyou can do anything in space that you haven\'t done successfully on the ground.\nBecause it\'s going to be just like the pancake. There is going to be something\nyou didn\'t do.\n\nWhen you ask questions like you asked me, my simple reply to you\n\nis, "How do they do it on the ground?" or "Have you done it on the ground?\'\'\nBecause if you are planning some wise and wonderful things up there, give or\ntake zero-G, then you really need to try it on the ground or find out how it\'s\nworked before.\nWhen I talk about handling dead crew members\' bodies and things like that, I\'m\ndrawing on my experience as a flight surgeon who has picked up about 50 bodies\noff the ground at one time or another and got blood on my hands. I learned to\ndeal with my own feelings, deal with the families of my friends when they got\nkilled, and that sort of thing. You physicians who have treated your friends\nand know what that is like, remember that the Crew Medical Officer is going to\nbe treating his or her friends and dealing with their bodies, and they may not\nhave had as much experience with death as you have. Most of you have seen folks\ndie; probably few of you have seen people get killed. There is a considerable\ndifference between those two events. Those are the dimensions we are looking\n\n17\n\ni\n\nat this morning, so if I get a little harsh in the way I look at it, it\'s because\nI don\'t like it. I\'ve done too much of it, and I really don\'t think very much\nof it, But if one has this type of wisdom, one should pass it on so that others\ndon\'t have to learn from experience.\nThe first decision you\'re going to have to make after a death in space is whether\nor not you will bring the body back. I suspect that this has been thoroughly\nthought out by a lot of people, and I hope they got some input from funeral\ndirectors, because there is a considerable literature by funeral directors about\nhandling bodies in catastrophes. There is a journal entitled, "Omega, the\nJournal of Death and Dying" which covers philosophical and psychological issues.\nWhen I was doing some of this stuff for the Air Force, dealing with what happened\nas a result of bringing the bodies back from Jonestown, Guyana, and what happened\npsychologically to the people who were involved, I stumbled into a large volume\nof literature by funeral directors on the effects on people on handling bodies\nand we need to get into that. "Are you going to bring it back, and how are you\ngoing to bring it back?"\nAlthough you had mentioned the body bag, you did not\ndeal with the issue of post-mortem bacterial contamination and some causes of\ndeath such as toxic exposures that may be a problem to you, and I think you need\nto think that through.\nThere are some real advantages to bringing the remains back. This allows an\nautopsy or whatever you want t o do t o learn about t h i s death so you can help\nprevent such a death in the future. This allows a funeral which brings the\nremains into the mainstream way that we know how to handle them. You can also\nachieve a closure on the death, in that you have a formal, socially acceptable\nand familiar way of saying, "It\'s over goodbye!" You get psychological closure\nin a conventional, familiar way so NASA doesn\'t have to invent a new way.\n\n-\n\nIf you don\'t bring the body back, my hunch is that it would be for an operational\nreason: toxicity, contamination or whatever caused the death. Perhaps the lethal\nevent was so catastrophic that it was impossible to retrieve the body, or the\nbody was so disrupted that it could not be collected, or the emergency was too\ngreat. In such instances, your alternatives are, as I see them, 1) do not bother\nwith it at all; or if you have the body, 2) jettison it overboard in what may,\nor may not, be an equivalent of the Navy\'s burial at sea. That will entail some\nother things which we will discuss in a moment. Cremation would be pretty hard\nto do, I would think. And if you are in a moon-based situation, then I presume\nthere will be an established burial ground on the moon eventually and probably\nthere would be a psychological plus to having a person who died in space or on\nthe moon be buried on the moon.\n\nI think you need to discuss ahead of time with each crewmember these\ncontingencies so that you don\'t have to make such decisions under stress as you\ngo along. Each crewmember could look at some of the options, specifically\ninvolving his or her individual preferences, religious preferences, any\nceremonies which might be important, and also, perhaps, dealing with the needs\nand wishes of the family. In my fantasy about all this, dealing with such issues\nin advance puts you in an authoritative position of being able to say, "that we\ntalked it over with himher, and this is what the individual wanted. " That would\ngive you the authority in the name of the individual astronaut as opposed to\nhaving to deal with the family under the stress of the moment. There is some\n18\n\n-_\nb..\n\nanalog to this in military experience, but we don\'t have time to get involved\ntoo much with that.\nNext, let\'s talk about the effect of such a death on the crew and the people on\nthe ground.\n\n,-\n\n-.\n\n.\n\nI think anything that one says about the effect of such a death on fellow\ncrewmembers must first consider what is safe for the crew and what does not\nimperil the mission.\nWe\'ll talk a little later about further aspects of the\nmission, but whatever you decide to do, handling remains must not endanger other\npeople.\nIf you think that\'s grandiose, I will tell you that, in combat\nsituations, bringing back the bodies of your buddies is right up there with\nwinning as a motivating force. A lot of people have been hurt in combat going\nout to bring old Charlie\'s body back, because they didn\'t want to leave it there.\nBringing your friends\' bodies back is so important that when we went into Panama\nfor Operation Just Cause, as some of you know, they had three bodies on the first\nair-evac airplane that flew the wounded back to San Antonio, and the implication\nwas that they died in flight. No, the Seals that were wounded wouldn\'t get on\nthat airplane unless the bodies of their comrades were on that airplane with\nthem. I tell you that story to give you the strength of the need to retrieve\nbodies; that may have to be something you have to deal with. The crew may not\nallow you to tell them not to retrieve the remains and that\'s useful information,\nI think.\nOnce they have the body, you must face a series of decisions: bring it back, not\nbring it back, bring it back now, or bring it back later. In the experience of\nthe military, it is important to have a ceremonial ending to a life. You must\nhave some sort of ceremony. Human nature cries out for it. You just don\'t sit\ndown, have supper, and go on with your work. You do something, and I think\nwhatever that is should be sketched in advance, at least in the rough so you\nknow what it is that you\'re going to do. I think this should come from the\nastronaut office, from the people who are going to be involved, not from a bunch\nof docs. I think, perhaps, one service to them is to emphasize the need to\nEach crew\nthink this through. They may have already done it, for all I know.\nshould have specific crew input into what they would do should this unlikely\nevent occur. Again, my hunch is that it would probably be modelled on military\ncustoms because that\'s what my mind went to, as probably yours did. Saluting\nthe flag, firing the volley, that sort of thing. It\'s sanctioned by long\ntradition, and what the military does in this instance is done because it\nIt\'s evolved down through the centuries. There would be\ngenerally works.\nappropriate deviations as the crew desired and circumstances allowed, including\nreligious input, and also we should acknowledge that the circumstances may not\nallow for much in the way of ceremony. I think if the crew can\'t have a service\nthen perhaps you can down here.\nBut you should\nshow a very sensitive\nflexibility, because nobody may really think this through until it occurs.\nLet me remind you about the value of input from an authority whom you value.\nThe psychiatric term is "consensual validation by a valued authority." When the\nPresident says, "These crewmembers did well, and we\'re going to miss them.\'\' it\nmeans a lot more than pulling someone off the street and getting them to say it\ninto the microphone. You want to go as high up the ladder for such recognition\nas you can, but I don\'t think you will have a problem with that. There will be\n19\n\nsome sort of a formal ceremony with the concurrence of the mission commander on\nboard the vessel. I would recommend that you allow one or two shifts of standdown or free time, and then invoke the military tradition (which works) that\n"you get right back on the horse and start riding again."\nIf an airplane\ncrashes, you have a missing man ceremony, you salute the flag at half mast and\nthen the next day you go back and keep right on flying because that way you\nvalidate to yourself that you can still do it.\nIf you let the flyers ruminate\nfor a long time, they begin to think that they can\'t do it. So they will begin\nto doubt themselves and to fail. Those who have worked in wilderness medicine,\nI suspect you have this tradition on your expeditions. What do you do, how do\nyou do it when somebody falls and doesn\'t get up? You\'ve got to get on with the\nexpedition in order to survive.\nA lot of thought needs to be given to how you\'re going to deal with the press,\nbalancing the public\'s need to know, the right of the free press versus the\nrequirements of privacy. NASA should know much more about that than I do. If\nyou have a continued mission, I think you need to have a private "how goes it?"\n24-48 hours with the crew after the event, what is known in the trade as\n"critical incident debriefing". There are some very specific ways to do this\nand people can be trained to do it.\nThis is important in preventing or\nminimizing "survival guilt," and "God, I\'m glad it was him and not me." This\nthought is followed by, "How could I think such a terrible thought?"\nFlight\nsurgeons have had to deal with this, so they know h o w it g o e s . I think you\nwould need to have some specific knowledgeable psychiatric input into that.\nPlus, you must have appropriate clergy input because of religious implications.\n\nIf you can manage to have just one consolidated mishap investigation, do it.\nI don\'t know if this is within your control or if there are too many authority\nfigures that have the right to investigate. Do anything you can do to keep down\nthe number of repeated investigations by everyone who get a committee together\nand get on a TV camera because this can be devastating. The Air Force manages\nto have just two investigations e.g., a mishap investigation to find out what\nhappened so it won\'t happen again and that\'s a no-fault, hands-off, non-legal\nthing and formal, legal investigation with the right to remain silent, right to\nhave an attorney, etc.\nSo you don\'t have the right to remain silent and all\nthat in the accident investigation, but they can\'t use that for disciplinary\naction. So if at all possible politically, get all the authorities together and\nall the committees together and have them make an mega committee and let that\ncommittee report back to its own root committees. Just ask the crew once, "What\nhappened?"\nHow about the effects of a tragedy in space on the ground control staff?\nIf\nall agree, and I do mean ALL, especially the people in the spacecraft, link the\nground support people to the crew ceremony in a private, and off-the-record,\ncommunication link. I think having the public invited to witness this on TV\nwould be terrible. Maybe film it for later, but do what you can to keep it\nprivate. I would also use the critical incident debrief technique with the\npeople who are on the ground; they are going to be have tremendous feelings of\nsorrow and, perhaps, guilt. The Challenger experience would give you all more\nspecific information about this than I\'m privy to, but I would certainly use\nthat as a model of both what to do and what not to do.\nThis process will then merge with the investigation that will be going on\n\n20\n\n.\n\nsimultaneously so you should work out in advance how these two are going to\ninteract because you are going to have to deal with issues of confidentiality,\nissues of information not obtained in later investigations, etc. You will\nobviously need to know what happened, but also you will have to deal with legal\nmatters, political matters, and other things which are way outside my area.\nYou also should, I think, make an effort to deal with outside agencies as high\nup the chain of command as you can to keep from getting into multiple briefings\nat lower levels. Some mishaps are terribly hard on all concerned, and my\nobservation from air crashes is that the people involved become tremendously\nfatigued. They can\'t do their job because they\'re briefing all the time, and\nthe emotional impact of having to do this over and over again for several weeks\nor months is just horrible. I\'ve lived through that a couple of times putting\nin 18 hour days for two weeks and never being left alone to do my job. This put\nstrain on my marriage and put strain on my relationships with other people that\nare difficult to understand if you haven\'t done it. So if you can, deal as high\nup the ladder as you can. If you can\'t and it\'s beginning to impact the mission\nI\'m assuming now that we have a death on a mission and the mission is still\ngoing on then you\'re going to have to consider whether to continue the mission\nbecause you can\'t do your job and talk to all these people both.\n\n-\n\n-\n\nNow you decide which you want to do, but if you\'re going to keep the mission\ngoing, you have to cut this process off and detach the ground crew and mission\ncrew from it, and let others on the ground deal with the investigation and the\noutside world. Otherwise, people are going to get fatigued and start making bad\ndecisions and you can almost predict a second catastrophe, because the\ninvestigation will become the major driver and not mission safety. Then you\'ll\nget dissention, mistakes, fatigue, guilt feelings, decreased sleep, and another\naccident. There is an old canard that military accidents tend to happen in\nthrees, and I think this may be where it came from. You have one and then you\nsort of have another one. I\'ve seen it happen; that\'s not sufficient evidence,\nbut it does happen.\nDealing with the victim\'s family, I would go back to the military model simply\nbecause the military has had to do so much of it. You should protect them from\nthe press and the public as much as is necessary and as much as they want - some\nseek publicity, some shun it. I think you need to go with the family\'s wishes\non that. And yet, you need to insulate them from all the public figures who\nwant to get their pictures in the papers with "grip and grin" poses because this\nway every City Councilman can get on national press and they love it; it\'s like\nbees to honey. But remember the usefulness to the grieving family of attention\nby valued authorities. You need to be very sensitive to this. The family may\ncrave the attention to help their own grief work. Obviously, you will be working\nwith a personal physician, the clergy, and possibly a NASA flight surgeon as your\nguide, depending upon what the relationships are. You will need to work that\non an individual basis, but try not to overwhelm the family with strangers\npeople they haven\'t met before. I\'m sure you\'ve learned your lessons from\nChallenger, and you must not allow yourself to forget to write so you don\'t\nrepeat that sort of thing. And remember that your own staff will be dealing with\npersonal issues of shock and grief. As an outsider, I certainly saw that with\nChallenger with the few people I knew at NASA. The medical authorities were as\ntouched by it as anyone else. Those of you who are flight surgeons have had\nfriends crash and have had to respond to that crash, so you\'ll relate to what\n\n-\n\n21\n\nI\'m saying. A n appropriate memorial service on Earth is important, and then\nfollow-up in private, perhaps using the "critical incident debriefing" model.\nAny questions on that part? We\'re about to change the topic here to one of how\nto deal with psychotic, neurotic and other kinds of disruptive behavior:\nThe reason that psychiatry is considered different from other kinds of medicine,\nI think, is that the psychiatric patients may be uncooperative and unpredictable\nand thus arouse anger and anxiety in those who have to deal with them. I think\nthe unpredictability is a factor that scares people off. Those of you who have\nworked on psychiatric wards on rotations remember that the first time you went\nthere, you felt qualitatively different than you did on a surgical or medical\nor pediatric ward. When you go to a psychiatric ward, your eyes start to whip\naround a lot, and the hair stands up on the back of your head. Realize this,\nif you have a psychiatric problem on board one of these aircraft or spacecraft,\nyour on-board medical representative is going to have that same anxiety and that\nanger up there. The transference and counter-transference issues within a crew\nare going to be almost overwhelming, especially if it\'s a neophyte therapist you\nhave up there.\nThese are pretty heavy issues for a physician who hasn\'t\npracticed for a while. Is what\'s happening a danger to self, others, and the\nmission? That question needs to be answered crystal clear. Yes, it is; no, it\nisn\'t. And no other answer will do because the outcome of those words is going\nto dictate what happens next. Because you will very quickly get into issues of\nauthority and punishment and confinement and the right to put on restraints and\nthings like that, so you need to have a fairly clear answer to the question, "Is\nthis a danger?"\nYou need to work out how to recognize this kind of problem and to diagnose\npsychiatric illness as opposedto personal eccentricity, and that\'s a lot harder\nto do than it sounds, especially when you\'re dealing with strong personality\ntraits. Again, if you work in closed environments for a while you will know\nwhat I\'m talking about.\nThe CMO may be too close to these problems to be\nobjective, and it\'s the same problem, I would guess, as treating your own\nfamilies. And you all should know the pitfalls about that. So I think one\nperson on-board, with the potential for treating a group of four, is going to\nbe really tightly tied to the problem, and somebody down here is going to have\nto be watching out for objectivity and issues of identification.\nCertainly\nyou\'re going to be dealing through the CMO who may consider himselfherself to\nbe an advocate of the patient; this may lead to an "us against you" sort of\nthing. These issues, I suspect, have already been thought of and discussed.\nThere will have to be decisions made involving individual therapy, medications,\nworking with the whole crew versus part of the crew, talking to ground, family,\nthe therapist and the other peoples\' decisions about bringing back, etc. I\ncan\'t begin to get into those complex things, but I would urge you to not\noverlook possible organic causes for any aberrant behavior. Toxic things,\ntumors and all the rest are the first cut any psychiatrist\nmetabolic things\nhas to make, in my opinion. This is the old "organic versus functional" issue.\n\n-\n\nI was asked to comment on handling bad news for crews when something bad happens\nto a family member, for instance,and there\'s really not a whole lot for an\noutsider to say about that. I would get an agreement ahead of time; use your\n\n22\n\nfantasy about what might happen and use what\'s worked in the past. When in\ndoubt, tell the truth. I\'ve been in trouble for lying, but I\'ve never been in\nthat kind of trouble for telling the truth\nthat\'s a solid rule of medicine.\n\n-\n\n# -\n\n.\nA\n\n-\n\nWhat about a doomed crew? People have asked me this ever since they started\nwatching science fiction movies.\nWhat are you going to do if the crew just\ncan\'t get back and they\'re going to run out of oxygen and die? My answer to\nthat is a question. What do you want to accomplish? What do you want? If you\nknow what you want, then you can work toward getting it. If you don\'t know what\nyou want, I\'ll guarantee you\'re not going to get it. Sometimes in psychiatry,\nwe asked people questions to get them to think. What are your goals in dealing\nwith a doomed crew? You can\'t make a rescue happen or you would have done it,\nso that\'s definitely out. Do you want them to continue productive work? If so,\nyou go one way with this. Are you trying to give their deaths a meaning?\nProductive work is almost the only way I can think of. Are you trying to keep\nthem from embarrassing NASA in some way? Do you want not to have them screaming\non the radio as they die? These things happen, and you need to think it through.\nDo you want to protect their families from it? Do you want to protect the public\nfrom it? Are you trying to make public relations as unharmful as possible? Are\nyou trying to work out a model for subsequent missions? Are you trying to tell\nthe rest of the astronaut corp how you\'re going to handle this sort of thing?\nThese aren\'t very good public questions, but you need to ask them in private and\nwork out your answers, otherwise you\'re going to tiptoe around the real issues\nand sometimes, frankly, the real issue is damage control. How little damage can\nyou take and get away with it? You need the input of clergy, it goes without\nsaying. I would look for a public expression by the President, I think nothing\nelse would do. I suspect the President would agree to that if the President is\nworth h i s h e r salt. You need to work to decrease the personal impact on the\nfamilies so certainly that has to be in your mind when you\'re dealing with wives\nand kids. You\'re dealing with an American public that identifies itself with\nyour astronauts and their families. How are you going to minimize the impact?\n"First of all, cause no harm," and I wrote in my notes,"Try to keep the last gasp\noff the air." I think that means just what it says. I\'m not any better than\nthe rest of you at this sort of thing.\nOne last topic and we\'ll open it up for discussion and questions. Some groups\nwork very well in unstructured situations and some groups worked very well in\nstructured situations. However, once the crew lifts off, there probably is a\nlegal relationship within that crew, and you may know what it is. If I give\norders, and I\'m the Captain, under what suasion do you obey those orders?\nPersonal magnetism? Prior consent? The Captain can hang you? What drives my\nauthority\nespecially if you don\'t want to do what I said? My gut hunch is\nthat the first thing you do is all get together and talk it over, but eventually\nsomeone has got to say, "I\'m the boss, and this is what you\'re going to do.\nThen the question comes ringing back, "How do you make it stick?" I think that\nhas to be really clear; it probably is already there. Is there a oath, is there\na pledge, a promise, an agreement, a contract, is there a "You don\'t get paid\nif you don\'t do what I say." What is it? It\'s an all volunteer force until you\nlift off, but then you can\'t retract after that. In International Command\nStructures, these things have to be worked out.\n\n-\n\n23\n\nHere\'s where the "Pancake Rule" starts to come in. If you can\'t make this stuff\nwork G A Earth, how are you going to make it work in space? I think then the way\nto make it work on Earth is carry it out through the tradition of maritime law\nI suspect that is going to be a driver. But you\nand things of that nature.\nhave issues of authority and safety, mission completion, discipline and the need\nfor punishment if it comes to that. What punishment are you arriving at and\nunder what circumstances?\nYou will need a clear and possibly enforceable\ndefinition of rules and limits of authority and responsibility.\n9uest ion :\n\n"Would you make any recommendations about long-term medical restraints?"\nIn the committee I worked in, one of the things I said was that we would probably\nneed the classic kind of restraints you all remember from your days on the\npsychiatric wards. In the unlikely event you have either a toxic or functional\npsychosis, a brief psychotic reaction to extreme stress or something, restraining\npeople so you don\'t hurt them is not easily done. Restraint will be your first\nline of defense, of course. Long-term, if you\'re restraining someone on board\nin zero-G, you probably are going to face problems which no one ever thought of\nbefore. I don\'t know what they are. The second thing is that you\'re going to\nhave to come back as soon as possible, bring them down as soon as possible.\nThat\'s as far as my thinking goes. Somebody said, and I don\'t know if it would\nwork, you could zip them up inside their sleeping bag and lock the zipper\nsomehow. You are all going to have to think about this before the need arises.\n\n_-\n\n24\n\nINDIVIDUAL\n\nPRESENTATIONS\n\n8\n\nPresenter: Bill Martin, Pharm. D.\nTopic:\n? -\n\nEstablishment o f a Pharmacy and Therapeutics\nComnittee for Space Station Freedom\n\nI would like to tell you this to alleviate concerns. The formulary is yours;\n^\n\nI\n\nr\n\n_.\n\nit\'s yours to determine. What you are looking at right now is the 9th revision\nthat Chuck and I did and the last time we did that was in 1988. We started this\nin 1985. The idea was to start to establish what the weights and volumes would\nbe and start to determine some quantities. In the past few years, I\'ve changed\nmy mind as to what I\'ve looked at as the formulary.\n\nSo, the question that was asked of me was to describe the system for updating\nthe pharmacy and central supply formulary during the Space Station Freedom life\ncycle which is approximately 30 years.\nI believe at this point in the\ndevelopment of the formulary, it is paramount that we baseline this and establish\nsomething called the pharmacy and therapeutics committee. What you see in front\nof you on the first page is the delegated authority chart recording structure\n(see support document).\nThis outlines the structure that goes with most\ninstitutions. Certainly all university institutions have structures similar to\nthis. They have a medical executive committee (in this case, it would be NASA)\nand then they have a pharmaceutics and therapeutics committee. This is a\ncommittee that is multi-disciplinary and typically has a pharmacist, a nurse,\nrespiratory therapist, someone from lab, but it is dominated by physicians and\ntheir specialties. Although these people have votes, there are only four votes\nthat are multi-disciplinary that have input, but there are typically 12 or 14\nphysicians on this committee and they each have a specialty so that when certain\ndrugs come up, they can provide their input. And then below them is a formulary\ncommittee. Since P&T committees get busy with all types of issues, protocols,\netc. they establish a formulary group. I recommend that we develop a formulary\ngroup, a smaller group of individuals. This first group, the formulary working\ngroup does the lion\'s share of the job. What they\'re going to do is evaluate,\nappraise, select and establish the baseline formulary. We need to decide in the\nnext few months what our baseline formulary is so that this group can say, "This\nis what it is, and this is what we would like to have." This is what we want\nto change. We need to start off with a baseline. What you\'re looking at now\nis a draft, it is not a baseline; it\'s a beginning.\nThey will provide\nrecommendations regarding additions, deletions or substitutions of the drugs,\nand\n\nI believe the decision should be based on the following issues:\nTherapeutic efficacy\nSafe Use\nEase of Administration\nPackaging Issues (Weight & Volume Constraints)\n\n25\n\nImpact to pharmac) central supply would be very minimal. This might be an\nexcellent product, but if it happens to weigh 10 pounds, it might be a problem\nflying it and we may have to start compromising on other issues. We also have\nto consider waste management which is, as we heard today, already a major\nconcern. Then once the formulary is up there, and once we\'ve got a year or two\nof experience under our belt, then this committee would review all of the drugs\nthat are on Space Station Freedom and decide which ones are not being used and\nwhether or not they should be deleted and recommend their deletions to P&T\ncommittee. This formulary working group committee does not decide what it\'s\ngoing to be. "This is what we think it should be," and then they present it to\nthe P&T committee. The P&T committee then provides recommendations on what\nshould be included in the formulary of acceptable drugs. We will develop\nguidelines for the safe use of the drugs and protocols which I think we need to\nconsider here because I\'ve heard the issues of pulmonary edema raised a few\ntimes, and when I think about the pharmacology and we have somebody with\npulmonary edema or we want to vasodilate somebody, I\'ve got a feeling that\nvasodilating somebody with pulmonary edema in zero-G is going to be a real\nproblem. I think that we might end up putting him into a worse situation, so we\nneed to think about those kinds of issues.\nThey will be responsible for establishing policies for maintenance of records\nregarding drug given, MARS and profiles. They will be responsible for QA and\nthey will be monitoring usage of these drugs. The chairman of this committee\nwill appoint the members of the formulary group.\nThe NASA medical executive committee is the final authority. It will approve\nor disapprove all P6T recommendations. Typically, in most institutions, if the\nexecutive committee chooses not to go with the decision of P&T, it has to write\nan explanation back to P6T explaining why. Typically, it\'s not questioned, but\nthen they don\'t usually challenge most of the P&T recommendations. The decisions\nhere for this group should be based on the cost limitation; it might be\nprohibitive. This is what the P&T wants to do and we all think as experts we\nshould be doing, but from a cost standpoint, it\'s prohibitive so it is not\naccepted. This is where you would consider the impact of all subsystems because\nsometimes we all get involved in our own little kingdom or domain and fail to\nsee the big picture. But with this, we\'ve got to see the big picture. And\nthen, finally, we have to make certain our decisions are consistent with the\nprogram direction. Perhaps they believe that there won\'tbe a certain capability\nalthough we\'ve talked about it before, we and based our decision on that. Only\nthey are going to know about that, but they have to keep us informed.\nThe last page you have here shows you suggested committee membership. Whoever\nwants to sit on that committee, it\'s okay by me. It\'s the authoritative group.\nTypically though, there\'s somebody from the administration. I assume we can see\nthe Branch Chief sitting here, the Section Head, the Director of Medical\nOperations and I can see those kinds of individuals sitting there. I also see\nthis committee meeting annually. The Pharmacy/Therapeutics committee - I also\nsee that meeting annually, perhaps otherwise. The Chairman here should probably\nbe either the Branch Chief or the Section Head. In all arrangements for P&T\ncommittees, the secretary is typically the Director of Pharmacy. This person\'s\nresponsibility is to organize the agenda on issues that the Chairman would like\n\n26\n\n. c\n\nto see, compile the information, and then maintain the official minutes of the\nmeetings and distribute those. I see this as the external Pharmacy Consultant,\nand if this is me or some other person, it should be someone with a Pharm. D.\n\n-\n\nThe Clinical Consultants us; I see us sitting on the P&T committee and perhaps\nsome external personnel, perhaps not. The issue that\'s at hand really is one\nof people. I mean in most institutions 14 to 16 people will cover most of the\nspecialties. We\'re 20 consultants right here, and there may be more in time.\nIt\'s just a question of whether NASA believes in having a good working committee\nwith 30 people on it. We may not be able to get a consensus. Finally, let\'s\ndiscuss the working group. I believe this group should be local, because this\ngroup is going to have to meet frequently, quarterly, bi-annually. They are\ngoing to be doing the bulk of the work. The Chairman here should be someone who\nis in this group (one of the consultants here), an M.D. All of these committee\nchairmen in institutions are typically M.D.\'s, so I see an M.D., one of the\nexternal consultants who will be appointed by the Chairman of the P&T to chair\nthis group. The Secretary, again, being a Pharmacy individual; in this case,\na NASA Pharm.D., and then I just picked some specialties at random. Looking at\nthe formulary, I thought I\'d need somebody from anesthesia, somebody from\nsurgery, medicine, critical care medicine; we could use somebody from Ob-Gyn;\nsomebody from biopharmaceutics is important; and, perhaps, somebody from\nnutrition, Pharm. D. or M.D. It wouldn\'t make much difference, just someone who\nwas familiar with the wide range of products. I would like to see all of this\nhappen by the first quarter of next year. We should start moving in this\ndirection. It\'s time for us to decide that this is the formulary, and this is\nwhat we\'re going to use.\n\n27\n\nINDIVIDUAL\n\nPRESENTATIONS\n\nL\n\nPresenter: Daniel 6. O\'Neill, M.D.\n.\n1\n\n.-.\n-\n\nTopic:\n\nOrthopedic Considerations: Strains, Splints, & Fractures\n\nI\'m a sports medicine orthopedist and from an orthopedic standpoint, I was asked\nto address several issues. Like everyone else, if forced to reduce weight and\nvolume, how would equipment be prioritized and Dr. Scheinberg was going to cover,\nI think, what would be some major changes in reductions and some splinting and\ntraction devices that can be made.\nI want to also say that all of our\nrecommendations are made with a firm resolution that the lifeboat is present that there will be a ACRV. I base this on the fact that a major femur fracture\nthat is not definitively stabilized within 24 hours is associated with a 25-40%\nserious morbidity and mortality rate. Pelvic fractures, and again these are\nhighly unlikely, nevertheless, a pelvic fracture would be associated with a 60%\nserious morbidity and mortality rate with ACRV. Some more mundane issues:\nWe have felt that in some of the reductions that simple, easily attainable\nproducts like tubular stockinette conserve and reduce the need for slings,\ntriangular bandages and other sources of padding in some of the equipment\nreduction roles. The big issue which has been discussed several times today is\nthat of functioning without standard x-ray imaging. Our committee\'s final\nrecommendations on that will be made during the Wednesday forum, but let me say\nthat we are going to present some alternatives to x-ray; I think the most\nimportant alternative that needs some serious investigation and consideration\nis looking into the Lexiscope. I had the opportunity to look into it briefly\na year ago during a talk on alternative x-ray sources. It is a hand-held device\nabout the size of the radar guns they use in professional baseball and it\'s\nalready gaining some popular andwidespread use in Southern California, and even\nsome of the more wealthy high school districts are supplying their trainers with\nthe same Lexiscope that they are using in the field. In this light, I did feel\nit was important that thoracic extensions be added beyond the Philadelphia\ncollars which are already present, but by adding the thoracic extension which\nare commercially available and don\'t take up much space, you add some additional\nstability and protection for the cervical spine which I think is important.\nFinally, and this is more from the sports medicine perspective, I definitely\nthink sources of cold and heat which can be directly applied to the extremity\nsurface or to the torso should be available. This becomes particularly important\nin light of the two hour exercise period. It\'s going to be part of the daily\nregimen. Whether this is in the source of ice or hot packs or a chemical medium\nhas to be determined. I think this is critical if simple overuse injuries don\'t\nthreaten the crew members initial performance. With a simple modality of cold\nand heat, overuse injury can be handled very well in the first several days and\nnot hinder performance. If you don\'t use a simple modality such as that it could\nseriously hinder your mission.\n\n29\n\nA fracture in this age group that carries a high morbidity rate is one associated\nwith bleeding.\nThat would be on, of the volume \'problems, serious pelvic\nfractures such as malaligned fractures.\nAre simple fractures able to be immobilized in SAM splints? Almost any extremity\nfracture can be handled with some of the splints and things that Dr. Scheinberg\nis going to refer to. I\'m interested in the concept of splints, strains, etc.\nin a zero gravity environment. It seems to me that we need to rethink all of\nthis because a lot of the things you do to protect joints and extremities are\nanti-gravity, and there won\'t be any gravity, so it seems to me that the\nsplinting and immobilization is going to be somewhat easier.\nThat\'s what you will find.\nI don\'t want to steal any of Dr. Scheinberg\'s\nthunder; all of these traction devices and everything else I\'ve suggested he\'ll\ntalk about.\n\n30\n\nI -\n\n..\n\nINDIVIDUAL PRESENTATIONS\nPresenter: John Rock, H.D.\nTopic: Gy~~ecol Diseases:\nogic\n\nIssues and Concerns\n\n.-\n\n-.\n\n-\n\nFor risk analysis of gynecologic disease, it is necessary to take into\nconsideration three broad categories. The questions which should be discussed\nare :\n1)\n\nIs pregnancy possible?\nIf pregnancy is possible, then the\ndifferential diagnosis and gynecology would include complications\nof pregnancy i.e., incomplete abortion and ectopic pregnancy. It\nis apparent at this time that the space station will not be well\nequipped or prepared to take care of obstetrical emergencies.\n\n2)\n\nWill female astronauts undergo ovulatory suppression? If female\nastronauts take oral contraceptives which suppress ovulation, then\nthe differential diagnosis for gynecologic disease wouldnot include,\nin most instances, pregnancy, ovarian cysts, bleeding corpus luteum\nand/or certain aspects of premenstrual syndrome.\nIf presented\nproperly, the female astronaut would consider strongly oral\ncontraception because the pill regulates their menstrual cycles.\nObviously, the ultimate choice is theirs. The female astronaut\nshould be aware of the limitations of the medical capabilities in\nthe space station, and that they are taking certain risks by not\ntaking oral contraceptives.\nIt is my recommendation that a low dose, combination oral\ncontraceptive be considered for female astronauts.\nThe oral\ncontraceptive should contain 20 to 30 micrograms of ethinryl\nestradiol and 1 milligram of norethindrione acetate. This would\nprovide ovulatory suppressionwith minimal side effects. The obvious\nadvantage to ovulatory suppression is reduce menstrual flow that is\npredictable. The astronaut could anticipate the menstruation event.\nWomen astronauts would have a reduced risk of abnormal uterine\nbleeding and avoid the complications of pregnancy.\nThe negative aspects of ovulatory suppression is that the side effect\nprofile of combination oral contraceptives in conditions of\nweightlessness are not known. The metabolic clearance rate of a\nspecific steroid in zero gravity has not been determined. The\nabsorption rate of oral contraceptives in the gut is unknown.\nFinally, life science experiments related to the study of the\nmenstrual cycle would not be possible.\n\n.\n\n3)\n\nThere should be selective screening to reduce the risks of acquired\ndisease on the space station.\n\n31\n\nThe importance of ongoing programs to exaluate and recognize women at increased\nrisk of gynecologic disease on space stations should be stressed.\nWith regard to gynecologic considerations, a laboratory should be available on\nSpace Station Freedom which would allow an examination of a wet prep of vaginal\nsecretions. Potassium hydroxide (KOH) and saline should be available f o r these\nexaminations. A dilatation and curettage in the dorsal lithotomy position should\nbe added to the instrument list. Waste management plan should be available f o r\ndiscarding uterine and vaginal tissue and fluids.\nThe availability of ultrasound for the diagnosis and management of patients with\ngynecologic disease should be given a high priority. Expansion of diagnostic\ncapabilities to include ultrasonography with vaginal, rectal, and abdominal\nprobes is essential.\nAdditional drugs to be maintained in the pharmacy on the space station should\ninclude :\na)\nb)\nc)\nd)\ne)\n\noral nystatin\na second line medication for vaginal yeast infections\nmycolog cream\nacigel cream and\nprogesterone in oil or oral provera.\n\nFinally, the medical officers on Space Station Freedom should be trained to\nperform a pelvic examination and to perform a dilatation and curettage.\n\n32\n\nINDIVIDUAL\n\nPRESENTATIONS\n\n1\n\nPresenter: Sam Scheinberg, M. 0\n.\nTopic:\n\nOrthopedic Considerations\n\n* -\n\n* .\n\nI would like to second what Howard Donner said, "I\'m a minimalist too," and\nthat\'s probably because I have had the opportunity over the past twenty-seven\nyears to see Orthopedic problems treated in many different ways. We\'re dealing\nin a remote environment similar to a wilderness environment. The first question\nwhich was asked of me was, "Does the HMF, as currently planned, have the\ncapabilities needed?" I would say that it has more than I need. The only\nquestion is which things do we pare down. Dr. Campbell mentioned this issue and\nstressed the importance of the type of person who was there. Interestingly\nenough, in orthopedics, with the kind of treatment I think we will need on space\nstation, it may not be a physician necessarily because as it turns out the\nsplinting of fractures and the immobilizing of fractures probably will be\ncommonly handled by paramedics and EMT\'s who, by and large, are much more\nskillful and knowledgeable than physicians. I would stick to Dr. Campbell\'s\nrecommendation that training should be required, because if it\'s a doctor or if\nit\'s an EMT, they need to understand how to handle orthopedic problems. There\nis just no way to do it except to do it, and somehow I feel these people need\nto rotate through a busy emergency room and have hands-on experience in looking\nat fractures, sprains and strains as a basis. So I think that\'s important.\nThe next thing is risksbenefits. The risksfienefits ratio, I think when I went\nthrough these materials and recommendations, I kept thinking of what the risks\nwere compared to the benefits. So with that in mind, and the rest of the group\ncontributing, we went through and put down some things. A lot of this, I\nsuppose, will be discussed tomorrow, but the bottom line is that I feel there\nis more danger with the use of inserting prongs and someone drilling holes in\nheads than the benefits.\nIf you don\'t insert pins, external fixatures or\ntraction pins, on a regular basis, you are just never going to get comfortable\nwith it, and you can do more harm than good. Frankly, I don\'t think it\'s going\nto be necessary. Most of these things seem to relate to cervical injury, but\nthe truth is that you generally have some history of head trauma,\nunconsciousness, or something to give you some clues to the seriousness of\ncervical injury. The most common cause of cervical pain in my emergency room\nis the cervical collar that\'s been applied. Usually when we get it off the\npatient, they\'re so grateful that it\'s the best thing you can do. So that\'s\nwhat I\'m talking about in getting a trained individual.\n\n.\n\nIf you have someone whom you suspect has a cervical injury, then inserting a\nwell-applied, comfortable cervical collar with the chest extension will\nadequately immobilize them, and it shouldbe apparent to that individual who has\nsome training whether this is a serious problem, and then you will have to\nconsider evacuation if you think this is a serious cervical injury. Most of the\ntime it will be apparent, so I think right away we rule out a lot of items. I\n33\n\ndon\'t think pinning the femur for traction is going to be necessary because,\nagain, if it is a low femur, you can splint that a h o s t like a tibia or knee;\nand if it\'s a femoral shaft fracture, that patient is going to have to be\nevacuated.\nIt\'s just as well to splint the opposite knee straight. You can\nsplint one leg against the other and then wrap them and wait until it\'s time to\nevacuate them. When the time comes to evacuate them, then you\'ve got different\ntypes of traction devices, but the Kendrick, I think is best, because it\'s light.\nIt looks like a little fishing pole. You could probably use it that way. So\nthen you could apply that and evacuate them out in this manner. I think I would\nleave the Kendrick in place, and I\'d leave the C-collars in place. I don\'t think\nyou really necessarily need the skeletal traction. Traction in a weightless\nenvironment is going to be kind of tricky. The arm sling I don\'t think you need,\nand as already mentioned by Dr. O\'Neill, we recommend tubular stockinette (any\nwidth tubular stockinette).\nIn a weightless environment you have a sling and\nyou get some elevation, but what good is elevation anyway? So the idea is to\ncontrol that extremity so it\'s not running free, banging into things, and if you\nhave a dislocated shoulder making sure it doesn\'t dislocate again. A sling in\na zero gravity environment will allow your arm to float away from your side.\nA stockinette velpeau will control the arm and also be available for multiple\nother uses such as padding, dressings, etc. With tubular stockinette, it just\ntakes one cut with the scissors, a few safety pins, and that extremity is held\nto the patient\'s side. As far as casting materials, naturally you can\'t put\nanything circumferential on there. If you do, you will have a problem, and\nyou\'re not going to have a cast saw up there. So you can apply splints, and we\nthought that probably you wouldn\'t want to get plaster dust or water in the area\nof any chemicals from fiberglass material. Perhaps a way could be found to avoid\nthat. The SAM Splints here will work for splinting most extremity fractures,\nand then there\'s a padding requirement, and I think they say, "make do." But\nif you have the tubular stockinette and curlex which is already there, then you\ncould use that as padding.\n\n-\n\nStraps for patient restraints I don\'t know if that\'s necessary in orthopedics.\nIt has already been mentioned. I\'m sure that would be a requirement. One of\nthe other questions was, well, I\'ve already mentioned what I would do to reduce\nweight, i.e., just those items we said we didn\'t need. The question was, "Could\nyou function without standard x-ray?" and the truth is "yes." As an orthopedist,\nI could function. With lesser training, perhaps there may be some problems.\nBut, again, you have to understand that in the wilderness environment all the\ntime, paramedics, E T and trained individuals are applying splints without xMs\nrays. The key is that it is just not critical. If it is a severe fracture, and\nsomeone has a little bit of training to recognize that, say it\'s a trauma\nfracture which is quite painful and swollen, then they are going to know that\nthey will have a problem. But is it all that critical that they see exactly how\nit is displaced? No. It is critical that they watch the circulation, sensation,\nmotor function, that they immobilize it, and as Dr. O\'Neill mentioned, get\nsomething cold to put on it.\nIt\'s not critical that they really be that\nconcerned, because no matter what they do as long as that limb is immobilized,\nit can be retrieved when that patient is evacuated back to the planet. So from\nmy standpoint, it\'s just not critical. Sure it would be nice, but it\'s not\ncritical, not from a cervical standpoint or any other standpoint.\n\n34\n\nWhat is new in technologies? I mentioned some. I don\'t think there are any\nspecial laboratory tests that I need.\nI guess what I\'m saying is that\northopedics is, obviously, not as sophisticated as OB, but we\'re not going to\nforce people to take medicine either.\nQuestion: Mark CamDbell\n\n* -\n\n-. _\n\nSam, are there some fractures that you could treat on the station without\nevacuation if you did have x-ray capability?\nWell, the thing is I could treat most of them. It would be apparent and you\ncould have it displaced. If someone rotates through an emergency room and he\nsees a displaced Colles\' fracture, that fracture can be splinted. The pain is\ngoing to be significant. Maybe you can\'t reduce it. Maybe he knows enough\nbecause he\'s had some experience to inject it and to reduce it with manipulation.\nBut even if he didn\'t, the pain from that fracture is going to diminish over the\nfirst few weeks. As we\'ve all know in orthopedics, we have seen things that have\nbeen reduced well or adequately, or we\'ve reduced them ourselves, and then they\nhave slid back to an abnormal position. They\'re still going to be pain-free.\nSure, the astronaut may be upset when he gets back to Earth and say, "Look at\nthis; this guy didn\'t reduce this properly.\'\'\nHe\'s going to see an orthopedic\nsurgeon who is then going to fix it even if he has to do a little osteotomy or\nsomething to regain the normal volar tilt. For most fractures, it\'s just not\nthat important. You can see and feel fractures in both bones in the forearm.\nA fractured humerus is pretty obvious, and a dislocation should be, if the\ncaregiver has the training and knows how to reduce a shoulder.\n\n35\n\nINDIVIDUAL PRESENTATIONS\ni\n\nPresenter:\nTopic:\n\nDouglas Stetson, M.D.\n\nLessons from Navy Medicine\n\n-My background is in operational medicine in Navy submarines.\n\n..\n\nSubmarines are\na truly isolated form of transportation and give you an opportunity to provide\nall kinds of support and care to the crew. I can tell you a little bit of what\nwe see in terms of what we see in terms of submarine problems.\n\nThe Navy fleet in 1989 evacuated 67 persons from submarines. I can\'t tell from\nthe numbers in my office how many of those evacuations were required for medical\ncare or were just convenient because the submarine was otherwise going to be in\na port or near some opportunity to put someone ashore. But of those 67, about\none-third were related to abdominal pain. Perhaps one-half of those were related\nto a surgical diagnosis which would ultimately turn out to be appendicitis and,\nin the interim, had medical treatment. The next largest group of problems was\ntrauma of the extremities i.e., a hand, a finger, a forearm that got banged up\nsomehow or another. The next largest category, interestingly, was psychological.\nA lot of people were depressed or anxious, or suicidal or something and the crew\ndidn\'t want to deal with it. I guess the crew didn\'t vote a lot; the Captain\ndid. The next group was dental which didn\'t have a great deal of discussion,\nbut that was the next category including fractured teeth and other things which,\nto me, were not potentially serious.\nAfter that, we had an assortment of problems. There was some trauma to the\nabdomen: someone who fell, somebody who had damage to his spleen which turned\nout to be a renal contusion which did not require much care, someone who had\nkidney stones, a couple of other people who had chest pain diagnosed as\nmyocardial infarction and who survived. So these kind of cases are out there\nin the 18-55 year old and are important.\nThe other group of folks that I deal with who are perhaps more tightly related\nto this project are the saturation diving community. Saturation diving is a\ntechnique where you put divers into a steel pressure chamber which makes the hab\nmodule of the proposed space station look absolutely gargantuan. You put four\nto six persons in this chamber, and you commit them to pressure which is similar\nto that where they will be doing work in what might be 600 feet of seawater; you\nthen leave them there for four to six weeks or so. The commitment is that once\nthey become adjusted to that pressure they cannot by any means that I\'m aware\nof be brought to the surface in less than some finite and extended period of\ntime, 2-3 weeks. That means that no matter what happens to them in there, they\nare not coming out.\nThere is no way; it is not going to occur, and they know\nit. They are only 2-3 inches of steel away from you, but you\'re not going to\n\n8\n\n37\n\nget your hands on them unless you join them inside that pressure chamber and\ncommit yourself to their pressure situation. And you are not going ta get them\ninto OR; you\'re not going to get them into any situation that can\'t be set-up\ninside the box with them.\nAnd I have dealt with those people. These divers are doing hard work under\nwater and so trauma is an issue which is difficult to fix. Nevertheless, I\'m\nnot aware of anybody who has died in a saturation chamber. In fact, I don\'t\nremember anyone even requiring surgery. We have had occasional instances where\npeople got foreign bodies in the eyes, chemical burns which needed to be rinsed.\nWe\'ve had any number of minor orthopedic injuries - strains, sprains, and\nlacerations all of which have been handled with typical things which are\navailable in the typical oil company diving operations which are contained in\ntwo things which look like large fishing tackle boxes. These contain the typical\nequipment you would take if you were a country doctor going on a house call:\nsimple diagnostic equipment, surgical tools and simple medications. What backs\nup the on-site medical kit though, is a sort of unlimited quantity of things\nwhich could be brought to the site over a period of days if people wanted them.\nSo you could imagine getting a person who was going to need intravenous therapy\nand instituting that, and going on, more or less, forever. You could imagine\nputting a ventilator in and going on as long as you needed to maintain the\npatient through decompression to the surface. You could imagine even adding\nanother person, but probably not more than one who had special training e.g.,\na general surgeon. Although the extra person isn\'t ever going to get out of the\nchamber for a month, it is obviously not nearly as isolated as the space station\nwhere you can\'t get more stuff either. So that\'s a trade-off.\nNevertheless, our requirements have never brought us to the point where we need\nthe kind of gear as space station.\nThe first thing I wanted to talk about is the feature that we\'re adding, computer\nsupport. Our computer expert will be talking more about this tomorrow, but what\nwe\'re doing is providing assistance to corpsmen who have an EMT sort of training.\nOur people are much better trained than EMT\'s in terms of diagnosis and\ntreatment, but not as carefully trained as EMT\'s in terms of emergency\nresuscitation. Our corpsmen are being offered diagnostic support that comes in\nthe form of computer programs which take information about what is going on with\na patient, essentially combine that information with other information that\'s\nknown about the patient, and come up with some suggestive ideas as to what might\nbe wrong and whether it is serious enough to warrant evacuation from the\nsubmarine and then offer that to the corpsman for consideration. Certainly, the\ncomputer\'s advice is never offered to the corpsman in terms of direction. As\na spin-off of the diagnostic process, treatment protocols are included which\nfocus on materials that the user has with him and the training he has been given\nin the Navy, so he has a sort of "cookbook" to go by or at least to remind him\nof what he should have done. None of this has had any particular value in\nemergency situations where everything has to be done based on what you know and\nwhat you have with you. So computers are something which can be used to augment\nthe skills of the isolated practitioner.\n\n38\n\n-..\n\nAnd finally the issue, is it okay to plan to treat just one person? I think\nthis is pretty well supported in my personal experience. We can start with the\nattack on the USS Stark by an Exocet missile. Despite the huge number of people\nthat died in the ensuing fire (and they died because they were cooked), only 20\nodd persons really came to the attention of the on-duty corpsman. He was the\nonly immediate source of medical care. He was able to handle almost all of them\nwithin his resources, not needing anything spectacular. He did something\nhe took excellent care of the people. Nothing that required highwonderful\ntech equipmentwas ever considered. When the first source of more senior medical\ncare arrived, it was in the form of a dental officer who did another outstanding\njob of sorting out those few people who did require care off the ship. Again,\nwhen the USS Samuel B. Roberts struck a mine in the Persian Gulf, only ten people\nfrom the ship, which suffered damaged (the hull was perforated and there was\nflooding), required evacuation beyond the care that could be provided by the\nmedical corpsman aboard. Those ten people were sent to a supply ship where a\nphysician was in residence. The medical corpsman, an EMT, who had decided which\npatients needed evacuation accompanied them. Those ten people were seen by a\nphysician on an adjacent ship within an hour, and that physician picked out three\nwhom he felt needed hospitalization. They needed hospitalization because they\nhad fairly extensive burns. One of them also had a displaced pelvic fracture\nand a problem with some small vertebral processes fractures in the back. They\ndid quite nicely in a local hospital, and within two to three days they were off\nto Germany. The kind of evacuation needed in this case would be easy from the\nspace station. Surprisingly, however, given the enormity of the calamity of\nthese two real-life examples, the actual number of persons who required special\ncare beyond what could of been provided from the two first aid boxes we carry\nfor diving operations was very, very small. So I think that planning to take\nvery good care of one person in the situation we face here is excellent in terms\nof scope for multiple small injuries in several crewmembers.\n\n-\n\n39\n\nINDIVIDUAL PRESENTATIONS\nPresenter: Charles Stiernberg, M.D.\nTopic:\n\nENT\n\n- Traumatic and\n\nInfectious Pathologies\n\nI\'ve mentioned to some of you that I feel like most of the problems that can\noccur in all specialties are either traumatic or infectious, but I want to modify\nthat statement and just restrict it to my area of expertise. I truly feel that\nmost all problems in the head and neck will either be traumatic or infectious.\nSo I\'m including obstruction as a form of trauma. With that in mind, the head\nand neck related problems that cause a level I11 or critical situation can be\ncategorized as airway obstruction or bleeding. Functions of the upper digestive\ntract are breathing and swallowing. A person must be able to eat; a person must\nbe able to breathe. If we maintain these functions in the face of trauma (or\ninfection), then we\'re halfway there to saving a person\'s life.\nWhat about fractures of the mandible? I would say that x-rays are not necessary.\n1 believe that even a crew medical officer who is not a physician, but with a\nlimited amount of training, could be taught how to palpate a mandible and make\na diagnosis on history and physical examination. Fortunately, many mandible\nfractures can be bandaged and that will suffice until the patient is transported\nback down to Earth.\nOur dental colleagues can certainly help us out by instructing the crew medical\nofficer on making a gunny splint or something for an external splint of a\nmandible fracture. Perhaps more importantly in the case of a mandible fracture,\nis how a person is going to eat\nmasticate? Mandible fracture patients must\neither suck through a straw or be on a soft diet. An alternative is use of a\nnasogastric tube. It would be indicated for bad facial fractures with lots of\nswelling and multiple fractures to a mandible when you just could not get\nanything down by mouth. A nasogastric tube, however, would require a pump rather\nthan gravity to get the food down into the stomach.\n\n-\n\nWith regards to airway obstruction, I\'ve noted that in the material we were\ngiven, tracheostomy has been taken off as a procedure, and I have mixed emotions\nabout cricothyrotomy versus tracheostomy. I know there are arguments on both\nsides.\nMy own feeling is that cricothyrotomy is perfectly alright in an\nemergency situation. In those situations where you need an airway, and you need\nit within a minute or two, doing a cricothyrotomy is definitely indicated. As\nan Otolaryngologist, I think that if we are going to use the cricothrotomy on\nspace station then we must accept the risk of complications down the road after\nthe person gets back down on the ground. Such complications can be life-long\n\'andcan effect voice production. Atracheostomy is, technically, more difficult,\nbut I believe that non-medical personnel could learn how to do a tracheostomy.\n\n41\n\nWhile tracheostomies are fairly easy in a broad spectrum of them, some are very\ndifficult to do. If push comes to shove, I will go with cricothrotomy and worry\nabout the complications later.\nThe primary location for bleeding in the head and neck is probably the nose.\nEverybody knows that with fluid shifts, one of the most common complaints of\nastronauts is nasal congestion, nasal congestion to the point where some\nastronauts can hardly breathe through their nose at all. I can well imagine\nturbinates of the nose being engorged with blood in such situations. Nasal\nturbinates have cavernous lakes that get filled with blood, and if you looked\nin the nose of a patient, you may not see any airway. With regards to nasal\nsinuses, infection can occur, and there c a n b e things that canhappen to sinuses\nthat are annoying, but most can be treated. Regarding the ear, I believe an\nadequately-trained crew medical officer can make a reasonable diagnosis based\na lot of time on a few questions. The ear can get infected, the eustachian tube\ncan get obstructed, or the tympanic membrane can be perforated due to trauma.\nFortunately, most things that can occur to the ear can either be treated by 1)\nmyringotomy or, 2) a medication, like an antibiotic or decongestant. So, there\nare only two therapies and both can be easily instituted. One simple problem\nthat needs to be looked for before the astronauts go up is ear wax. A wax\nimpaction can cause a very annoying hearing loss.\nWe can certainly teach\nsomebody how to clean out wax.\nOne more point should be made about sinuses. When you have a congested nose or\nan upper respiratory infection, secondary sinusitis can occur. That\'s just the\nnature of the disease. It occurs when the sinus ostia get blocked up and when\nyou\'ve got swollen turbinates. It\'s easy to take a history and figure out what\nis going on; there is nothing magic about that.\nQuestion:\n\nDonald Stetson\n\nI can add one scenario because there is going to be a hyperbaric chamber on\nboard, and I guess with a lot of EVAs, there is going to be, I would guess,\nmaybe one or two table runs In the 3 month period. Given that the upper airways\nare congested, there is going to be some sinus and barotrauma because of the\nhyperbaric chamber runs. The question vould be is there anything I should add\nfor sinus or barotrauma?\nWell, there\'s sinus and barotrauma and there\'s ear barotrauma. We see a lot of\nthat in practice in people when they go up in airplanes and when they come back\ndown, they get severe pain, congestion, andhearing loss. For the sinuses, just\nput them on a topical decongestant. If it\'s not on formulary, it really should\nbe, although I have to warn against overuse of it. For sinuses and barotrauma,\nall you can do is use a topical decongestant and then watch and make sure they\ndon\'t get infected.\n\nIf serious otitis media or hemotympano behind the ear drum become a problem due\nto hearing loss, there is a myringotomy knife in the equipment list, and I think\n\n42\n\nwe could train an individual how to use it.\nIt\'s not difficult. A conscious\nindividual can Valsalva in the hyperbaric chamber.\nWe never insert tubes in\npeople who are conscious who can Valsalva.\nIt\'s only going to be that\nunconscious individual or if something is happening to him that causes some\nproblem.\nOuest ion :\n--\n\n.\n\n.-\n\nDid you ever see a need for doing maxillary sinus puncture.\ntrain the CMO to do that?\n\nIs it necessary to\n\nI can\'t imagine when it would be necessary to do a maxillary sinus puncture.\nWe do those punctures, and they have been done more in the past than they are\ntoday, oftentimes to get culture material for a maxillary sinus because the\ninfection is not resolving on the antibiotic.\n\n--\n\nI\n\n43\n\nINDIVIDUAL PRESENTATIONS\nPresenter:\nTopic:\n\nFrank Thomas, M.D.\n\nCriteria for Medical Transport and Transport Considerations\n\n-I .\n\nMy background is with critical care medicine and transport of critically ill\npatients. The question I got asked as a write-in is, "What criteria would I\nsuggest for determine the need for transport from the Space Station Freedom to\nground?" Let me make a comment before I go on and answer that question, and\nthat is that I think the use of the ACRV and telemedicine really changed the\nmedical requirements for the space station including the need for 14 days of\ncritical care medicine. The capability of being able to shuttle somebody down\nin 24 hours reduces that need quite dramatically from 14 days to, presumably,\na maximum of 2-3 days as far as critical care medicine is concerned.\nComing\nback to the question as to what criteria would I suggest for determining the\nneed for transport from space station back to Earth ...in the literature right\nnow, there is only one area that I think addresses, or uses, any criteria to\ndefine the transport of critically ill patients, and that is in the trauma\nliterature involving physiological scoring. That data really isn\'t applicable\nhere. It\'s design for use by paramedics and EMTs in the field to move critically\nill patients to a local treatment center.\nIn the case of the space station, you have uplinks with telemedicine, and I\nthink that changes that requirement. So when you look in the literature, there\nare no criteria that actually define who is going to benefit from transport.\nSo when it comes right down to the criteria, the criteria can be stated as\nfollows :\nAny additional excessive delay in transport would result in a loss of blood or\nsevere and permanent disability. That would be my criteria for considering\ntransport from the space station to ground. More importantly is what are the\nfactors which should be considered in initiating an emergency medical ACRV\ntransport? Those are the issues we face when we are going to launch a rescue\nbetween helicopter and ground transport.\nI have broken those down into\nessentially nine categories:\n\n.-\n\n.\n\nThe first factor would be the type and severity of illness or injury. Has it\nexceeded the capabilities of the Health Maintenance Facility and what defines\nthat would be the next category which is concerning the crewmembers on-board.\nCan they deliver basic advanced life-support specialty care? So that would be\nthe second factor, what is my medical personnel capability up there?\nThe third is what are the capabilities of delivering that care over an extended\nperiod of time. Although I know of physicians that are great at giving orders,\nwhen it comes to taking care of critically-ill patients, most of us stink in\nthat setting. That\'s a nursing skill, and most of us would be overwhelmed to\nhave to take care of a patient for more than 24 hours. Even a well-trained\n45\n\ninternist who is taking care of a critically ill patient would exceed his\ncapabilities within 12 hours and that\'s when the next nurse comes on. Many of\nus who have been involved in taking care of a critically ill patient in that\nsetting know that within two to three hours, we\'re in over our heads. So the\ncapacity to develop or deliver a continuous level of medical care is the third\nfactor.\nThe fourth factor is what equipment is available to you that would help alleviate\nthat workload? Here you\'ve got oximeter, all sorts of devices which we put on\nthe patient, including monitoring which helps unload our workload with\nrequirements for taking care of those patients, including automatic blood\npressure devices and indwelling catheters which make that workload tremendously\neasy and what will happen with regards to ACRV transport down is, "Have I\nexceeded that capability. I can no longer monitor the patient. I don\'t have\nthe equipment necessary."\nThe first component I think is required in whether I am going to initiate an\nemergency ACRV is the time dependency of the disorder, and I break that down\ninto three different categories:\n\n1)\n\ntransport which means time is crucial to the\noutcome. An example would be uncontrolled bleeding. This is\na person who needs to be brought down immediately and there\nis a surgical disorder that needs to be taken care of on the\nground. We\'re not going to be doing surgery up there on space\nstation.\n\n2)\n\nThe second category with regards to urgency would be immediate\ntransport for a condition wherein a short delay does not\naffect outcome, but a long delay could cause harm. A classic\nexample would be the b u m patient.\nI may be able to\nresuscitate him for 24 hours, but after that, I\'m starting to\nexceed my capabilities for the long-term care of that patient.\n\n3)\n\nOf course, the third category is elected transport. A guy has\na broken leg, tibia or fibula. I don\'t need to initiate ACRV;\nI can wait for the shuttle to come up and take care of him.\n\nAn urgent\n\nThe sixth component is on the availability of telemedicine. Clearly what I have\ndown on Earth is a brain trust of individuals who can provide me with inside\nknowledge in caring for that patient, and a good EMT, or somebody who has EMT\ntraining, can be instructed as to what to look for and what to examine is order\nto assist in the diagnosis of those patients.\nThe seventh category is shuttle launch availability. If it turns out that the\nshuttle is going to launch in two days, it may be better to wait those two days\nand have the shuttle come up and transport that patient out. That way we\nwouldn\'t have to initiate the ACRV and bring up another ACRV and have all the\ncomplications associated with this trying to initiate basically two transports.\nThe eighth category would be the safety to risk versus the benefits of\nwhat the\nperforming the transport, and that would depend upon several things\n\n-\n\n46\n\n-*\n\n..\n\nenvironment is with the + G reentry profile, the weather conditions which may\n,\nbe involved, and the availability of the rescue teams would determine the time\nI might initiate that particular ACRV transport.\n\n7\n\n-\n\n..\n\nFinally, the last category which has affected us and NASA largely in transport\nis the cost. Is there a benefit of initiating an ACRV, when in three to four\ndays, I could have the shuttle come up there. Or, do I want to scrub the\nshuttle mission - what may be a billion dollar launching of the Hubble\nSpacecraft. It may be a lot cheaper to come in with the ACRV and to scrub that\nshuttle, pull-out the Hubble, reload it, etc.\nSo there are a lot of\nconsiderations, and those are the factors that I thought should be involved in\nany emergency medical ACRV transport.\n\nIf someone had a catastrophic bleed, would you put them in the ACRV and send\nthem home?\nIt wouldn\'t work. No. You can\'t operate on them. We already know that we\ndon\'t have general surgical capabilities, so what you\'re going to do is replace\nvolume, put mast trousers on them, stabilize them and take-off. That happens\ntraditionally; a six hour transport is not usual for us to initiate and do it\nsafely as long as we run enough volume in to that patient. Clearly, obviously,\nthey could bleed-out; that\'s the problem you run up with doing general surgery.\nYou have no blood products available to replenish them. No more than you have\nat a small clinic or a hospital.\nOuest ion :\nThe mast trousers would make a difference?\nOh, nobody knows that. I would attempt to use it with\nchest wise, but nobody knows the answer to that, but\npressures that go up 60, so if I thought it would raise\nliterature that\'s out there, and you\'re aware of it, is\nwas done here in Houston.\n\n47\n\ninternal bleeding - not\nhypotension with blood\nthe pressure. The only\npenetrating injury that\n\nINDIVIDUAL\n\nPRESENTATIONS\n\ni\n\nPresenter: Thomas Tredici, M.D.\nTopic:\n\n..\n\nOphthalmologic Concerns for Space Station\n\nThat also brings out some startling news that I have that the average age is\ngoing to be 40. That puts us back into business even more than I thought. All\nwe have to do is screen these people, and we\'ve already been through that. Now\nI find out though that we\'re going to have to have approximately 15 significant\neye injuries and even though none will die from the ocular conditions listed,\nthey will be visiting the health personnel in the space station more often than\nfor anything else except, perhaps, dermatology. In other words, the number of\neye case visits will be significant, so that causes me to reevaluate my thinking\nconcerning what I am doing here.\n\nI know you understand, of course, that we have talked about whether we use an\nM.D. or a technician and their training.\nThat\'s not going to be any problem\nfrom the eye standpoint since we\'ve been doing that. SAM (School of Aerospace\nMedicine) has been doing that for about 70 years, and we also have a\ntechnician\'s training program at the school for ophthalmologic technicians. And\nwe do have done this without any problem, and the technicians can do very well.\nAs a matter of fact, that\'s how I got started training the technicians for the\nophthalmologists in the Air Force because when we used to give a pretest the\ntechnicians scored higher than the M.D.s.\nNaturally, after the course, the\nM.D.s did better, but the technicians did well on a lot of these procedures that\nwe are talking about here.\nI thought the length of treatment was 45 days, now it\'s down to 14 days, so that\nchanges things a bit for us in ophthalmology as you will see because most of\nthese are nuisance visits or things that are going to be occurring except when\nit is a foreign body in your eye and you need binocular vision; you\'re going to\nbe incapacitated until you get it taken care of.\n\n.-\n\nOne of the important things for me that I haven\'t gotten completely answered yet\nis if you had a good secondary screening of these individuals for chronic\nafflictions, ninety percent of these things we are talking about will disappear.\nI think that is important, although I haven\'t been able to get feedback on\nwhether that can be done. Once you get your NASA physical, that\'s it. In that\naspect, we have been becoming more lenient from the vision standpoint. Now if\nwe are going to do this mission for 45 days, we will have to reconsider.\nWe will have to come up with some rules about which afflictions or problems\nwould not be allowed to go and not get too much static. Example: Now we\'ve\neased up, I can say that 40-50% of the subjects will need some kind of aid for\nvision, either glasses or contacts. If we are going into this at age 40 and\nabove, 80% of these are going to have to have spectacles to be able to do their\njob, because all have jobs necessitating vision. So that means they are going\n49\n\nto need help to see. Spectacles have been used now for 500 years and are a good\nicem .to be continued into the space age.\nI would say that we forget the\ncontacts, although I do know that NASA has allowed contact lenses to go into\nspace. That\'s okay for short periods of time i.e., a couple of days. If we\'re\nstill talking about 45 days, then I think that\'s going to be a reason for visits\nto the medics from people wearing contact lenses. They are going to get\noccasional abrasions; we are going to have to haul up a whole bunch of sterile\nequipment, (or sterilize it there) fluids, spare lenses, etc. Plus, I don\'t\nknow at this point what the humidity is going to be in the space station. That\nwas a significant problem noted during our research on the use of contact lenses\nin aviators; it was the dryness on the transports, the C-5s and 141s that really\ncaused most of the difficulty. For short-term flights, there should be no big\nproblem. In the flight from Kelly Air Force Base to Japan and back, we had a\nlot of contact lens dryness problems on the way back.\nOne visual problem which may occur in the younger air crew is that they will be\nin a confined space similar to a submarine, and they may become more myopic.\nThey may get a change in their refraction, maybe not on the first trip, but if\nthey stay up 90-180 days, they could show a change. This does not create any\nbig problem because they are all going to be doing things inside, and it\'s the\ndistance vision that will decrease in those who may be affected. If the error\npersists, it can be corrected.\nHow about emergencies? The kind of emergencies that I envision are chemical\nburns to the eye, and that would have to be taken care of right away with some\nkind of ocular irrigation. But I understand there is, or you are working on it,\na system where during the irrigation you can recapture the fluid. If you don\'t\nhave that capability, there are going to be a lot of itchy eyes that could\nbenefit from irrigation.\nAnother true emergency is central retinal artery occlusion, but that\'s all over\nwithin a matter of minutes so there\'s not much you can do about it. Ocular\nmassage could be tried to drop the intraocular pressure or the simpler thing\nwould be just to breathe into a bag. Another urgent thing would be a lacerated\ncornea. You might ask, how might that occur? I can see that while floating\naround in this chamber someone could run into one of those shelves which are\nprojecting out from the wall.\nSo that could be a possibility. An abrasion\nwould be more probable, and that can be handled by your corpsman, med tech or\nmedic. The corneal laceration would be a problem. We teach flight surgeons to\nuse a liquid antibiotic on these lacerations and put on an eye patch and\nprotective shield.\nThe patient is then taken elsewhere for definitive\ntreatment; however, this can not be done on space station. I think the easiest\nthing to do here is have some glue (cyanoacrylate) and once you have a good look\nat what you\'re trying to deal with, you could seal the laceration.\n\n-\n\nGlaucoma\nWell, that\'s what I meant by screening. If you don\'t send anybody\nup who has potential closed angle glaucoma, you won\'t have that problem. Open\nangle glaucoma in a 45-48 year old crewman is not quite the same problem even\nif they are not treated in an emergency i.e., 30-40 days; however, ideally\ntreatment will not be discontinued. When discussing the cleaning of corneal\nulcers, we must note that if we get rid of contacts, lots of ulcer problems\nshould disappear. But should we get a corneal ulcer, do we have microbiology?\n\n;\n\n*-\n\n*.\n\nYes, but we wouldn\'t want to put it up there just for ophthalmology.\nBut\nsince we do have that capability, we could do a simple smear, take a look at it,\nand then decide which of the antibiotics that we have would be useful. If we\ncouldn\'t do that, we could use the shotgun method and just use the broad\nspectrum antibiotic and atropine and follow its course.\nThe most common things would be corneal foreign bodies and corneal abrasions.\nCare of both of these conditions can be taught to the medical personnel.\nTelemedicine/audio-visual transmission might be helpful in some of the external\neye cases. We do some of that now when our flight surgeons call our office for\nadvice on eye cases of flying personnel in their care. However, by phone, this\nis only audio information.\nThe other thing that may cause a problem with trauma is a hyphema. If a person\ngets stuck in the eye, he may bleed into the anterior chamber. In about 80-85%\nof these cases, you will probably have no problem. If you merely keep him\nquite, the blood will disappear and the eye will return to normal. In about 1015%, the blood will not be absorbed or will rebleed on the second or third day,\nand you will then have to be concerned about whether or not there is an\nincreased pressure in the eye. If the pressure goes above 40 in the eye and\nstays up, you are going to affect the optic nerve and lose vision. So, for that\nreason, I would suggest that we have a tonometer onboard. I don\'t think we are\ngoing to be out there diagnosing glaucoma. There was a tonometer listed, and\nI think it was a Shiotz. However, that won\'t work because the Shiotz is a\ngravity instrument. The Tono-Pen is now available which is a pizo-electric type\ninstrument not affected by gravity. The only difference in these instruments\nis that the Shiotz costs about $150.00 and the Tono-Pen about $3000.00.\nThe most common things that you\'re going to see up there is dry eyes, allergies,\nconjunctivitis, and ocular irritations. We should have medications onboard\nwhich will take care of most of these. I\'d like to say that if we get rid of\ncontact lenses, many of these conditions will decrease. The other thing is that\nI went through on this list, and I did change a few things. I changed things\nlike proparacaine for tetracaine. I couldn\'t find the fluorescein strips until\nthe last page, but they are in the black book. I also think you need an eye\nirrigating fluid like Blinx or Neo-Flow because they are compatible with\nfluorescein strips. They work better than just using a saline solution.\nNowhere on the list was there an ocular decongestant like vasocon or visine\nwhich are popular medications for mild ocular irritations. First I said that\nwe shouldn\'t use any contacts, but I think you ought to have a therapeutic soft\nlens. It doesn\'t take up much space or weight (one or two vials), and it\'s\nsterile. If we have a corneal ulcer that is not healing, we could place a\ntherapeutic contact lens over the cornea because it would stop the lid\nirritation, and often that alone will help the ulcer to heal. There was no\ntimoptic on the list, but once again, we will not be treating glaucoma.\nHowever, you might want to use timoptic in the care of the patient with hyphema\nwhose pressure has gone up.\nAnd last, but not least, the most common ulcer that individuals will probably\nget is dendritic due to the herpes virus, and that is not going to be difficult\nto diagnose once you see it. One could probably diagnose this even from a\n\n51\n\nphotograph. We will need a topical antiviral agent, such as IDU or vivara to\ntreat these cases.\nWith regard to the instruments, I didn\'t see anywhere in there where there was\nan eye spud. There were sterile needles, but I think the spud is better because\nit has two blades; one is flat and one sharp. We may want to get an alger brush\nwhich is a very low-powered, rotating instrument that uses a fine dental burr\nto remove iron rings that occur with ferrous corneal foreign bodies.\nWhat kind of magnifying instrument should we use? A binocular loupe can be used\nwith, or without, glasses would be a good compromise. A good one like Keeler\nor Zeiss can be selected for whatever distance you find most comfortable, i.e.,\n12" or 15" working distance. I like the Keeler because you can put caps over\nthe optics and double the magnification.\n\nIf there is going to be any kind of eye lid suturing, we will need some sort of\neye speculum needle holders, forceps, and 6-0, 8-0 sutures. There\'s nothing\nlike that listed at present.\n\nI was most surprised when making this list. We\'re trimming this all down to\nless than what we can carry in a shoe box and are copying wilderness techniques,\nbut we are told that we will have a Fundus eye camera capability on board. Why?\nI then find out that it is part of the research scenario, so if that\'s the case\nand there is a Fundus camera, it could help in making a diagnosis except that\nit works in only two dimensions so you can\'t see depth, and there is no color.\nt\n@ x e s ion :\n\nCan you use eyedrops in zero-G?\nThese eyedrops come in plastic bottles.\ndrops will be fired out.\nFoment:\n\nYou can press on the bottles and the\n\nChuck L1ovd\n\nThe bigger bottles, we\'ve found, are a little bit easier to get a little bit\nbetter force. You can get it out. There are two problems with real small\nbottles, i.e., you can\'t get enough force through your fingers, and they are\nvery inefficient and the amount of volume. The bigger bottles are better. The\nsecond thing is there is sloppiness in terms of touching the eyes. But so far,\npeople seem to be most satisfied with the drops rather than the ointments. We\ngo back and forth.\n\n...\n\nUsing the glass dropper, and sticking it back in the bottle.\nHere you can\nw e it, take an alcohol wipe, clean it off, and put the top back on. This is\nthe advantage to using plastic bottles and decreasing the possibility of\ncontamination.\nQuest ion :\n\nDo you think that having an eye shield (goggles) would be a way to reduce\nfloating foreign bodies in the eye and conjunctivitis?\n52\n\n- *\n\n.-\n\nHalf of them will have an eye shield like mine i.e., spectacles. We found that\nin our USAF air crew if they have 20/20 vision and you wanted to correct them\nto 20/12, they can hardly tell the difference and won\'t wear the glasses. They\ndon\'t like the glasses, and they are an interference.\nQuest ion :\n\nI was thinking about some kind of comfortable eye shield just for protection\nfrom the particulates in the environment and things like that.\nI.\n\nWell, the Army has tried that. They have one called Gargoyle Goggle Kit, but\nit was a failure because they wanted to do everything for everyone. It was\nunwieldy and too involved to use. A simpler eye shield might work, but I don\'t\nthink it will be necessary on space station.\n\n53\n\nINDIVIDUAL PRESENTATIONS\n;\n\nPresenter: Lou Wagner, Ph.D.\nTopic:\n\nImaging Systems for Space Station Freedom\n\n( I -\n\n..\n\nI think I should spend a little time introducing myself. I\'m probably the\noldest veteran in this group. I\'ve been here almost since it\'s inception, so\nI\'m pretty familiar with the evolution of the HMF. I am not a physician; I\'m\na physicist. My degree is in nuclear physics, and I did my post-doctoral work\nat Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York in medical physics. I am\ncurrently an Associate Professor at the University of Texas Medical School and\nI\'m the Chief X-Ray Imaging Physicist at that University.\nThe role that I\'ve played with this group, KRUG, and NASA is on the development\nof an imaging system. The decision on whether or not an imaging system should\nM\nbe onboard the H F came through preconsultation meetings, and I will share a\nlittle bit with you because what transpired in those meetings may be some\nindication as to why we are where we are today in imaging. Then the question\nis, "Where shall we go?"\n\nIn the first meeting, we were a little naive. The initial idea was to launch\nthe Mayo Clinic. There were suggestions about nuclear medicine equipment, NMR,\nCT, conventional x-ray, ultrasound - the whole works.\nI believe there was a\nlot of naivete about, you know, "Hey, we\'re in space; we\'ve got limited volume,\nlimited space; we\'ve got to keep the system small." At that first meeting, what\nwe did was look for guidelines about what our limitations were.\nIn the second meeting, we had a better idea about our limitations, and there was\na more realistic approach to the type of imaging needed. More arguments were\nmade pro and con for imaging. The question was raised as to whether an x-ray\nimaging system was technically available for the confines of the space station.\n\n..\n\nOne of the individuals didn\'t want an x-ray machine up there because it would\nbe producing extraneous radiation in a closed environment, and that wouldn\'t be\ndesired. When you think about the proton radiation up there and the amount of\nradiation scattered from an x-ray machine, there\'s no point to the argument.\nBut based on the technology, the question at that time (and you have to put this\ninto the perspective of five or so years ago), was whether it could it be done\nin a small enough package. Could it reasonably be done? That was one of the\nbig issues. If it could be done reasonably, then, yes, we think we will want\nit. If it can\'t be done and it can\'t be done in a reasonable package, then\nwe\'re going to have to find ways to live without it. So there was a lot of\nuncertainty about the decision-making process and as to whether or not imaging\nwould be available.\nOne has to put this all into perspective.\n\n55\n\nAt that time, we were looking at\n\nmaybe a five or six man crew for 90 days with no return vehicle and the\npossibility that someo.ie would have to be stabilized over a three month period.\nA decision might have to be made to spend $200 million dollars to send up an\nambulance. The question is where did x-ray play a role in that kind of decision\nmaking process? Would we want x-ray up there if we had a sick person and had\nto make this decision about him or her? Another part of that decision was,\n"What part would x-ray play in preparing this individual for return?" Taking\nthis person back to Earth is a lot different than trying to take him off a ship\nat sea.\nSo you have a little bit different preparation problems, and the\nquestion is, "Would he/she be returned worthy?"\nThere\'s a lot of decision\nmaking there for the care of the individual. Also entering into that decisionmaking process is the cost and the political consequences if you make a decision\nand it\'s the wrong one. If you decided not to spend the $200 million because\nyou had a situation on your hands that you didn\'t really think was there, you\nmay be jeopardizing the life of an astronaut.\nThe decision at those previous meetings was that we wanted to have the best\ncapability and make the best decision that we possibly could. That was some of\nthe justification for having an x-ray system onboard.\nWhen we came back to the third meeting of the consultation committee, I think\nwe had a better concept of what we were going to do, and we were still working\non a 90 day scenario with an ambulance costing $280 million. W e now wanted to\nsettle on the questions concerning the uniqueness of space, not the analogies\nto wilderness environment or a submarine.\nBecause of the remoteness and functionality of the space station, one important\ngoal was to provide care sufficient to make people functional again. Saving\nthat time for that crewmember that you have up there for 90 days is a big\nsavings. Our goals included not only a level of critical care but also a level\nof care to keep astronauts functioning. Now what role does x-ray play up here?\nThe overall decision from those first three sessions was that to keep the crew\nfunctioning for 90 days and to be able to make very critical decisions; x-ray\nwould be a part of this facility.\n\nI think we have to reassess those decisions based upon changes that have\noccurred in the last several years. But I thought it would be important for me\nto review what has previously transpired. Five years ago, the decision was made\nto do a study to see if we could develop an x-ray unit which would meet the\nrequirements of the W. That study suggested that something reasonable could\nbe done.\nLet me review some of the things that I can remember from these first three\nmeetings. First of all, the ambulance at a cost of $200 million was a very\nimportant feature. The diagnostic confidence in decision making had to be high.\nMajor clinical problems cited were problems involving the chest and the kidney.\nOne of the most important problems cited was diagnosis of kidney stones.\nRussian cosmonauts have had some serious health problems. Their station is a\nlot different than sending a ship out to sea where you don\'t have a high\npercentage of health problems. I would think that on a percentage basis, there\nwas a much higher incidence of health problems up there, and some of them are\npretty serious. Now we\'re going to be sending individuals up there for 90 day\n56\n\n,\n\n-.\n\nstints. We\'re intending to do this over a 20-30 year period. The question is,\n"What are you going to run into up there?" I think,there might be difference\nfrom the analogies we\'ve been making, and we should keep those in mind.\n\n..\nF .\n\nThe decision at previous meetings was that the level of care should be much\nhigher than the minimum. I know we\'ve been trying to stress the minimal at this\nmeeting, but the decision at that time was to provide a very high level of\nmedical care up there. It was recognized at the time that the x-ray would have\na low-frequency of use, a high cost, high volume and high weight; it still was\nconsidered necessary at that time. Maybe we have to reassess that on the basis\nof new information, and I think, as Roger pointed out, we have the possibility\nof an ACRV. That affects the use of x-ray markedly. You are better at making\nthat decision than I am. I\'m not a physician; I\'m a physicist.\nACRV is not certain, and so we\'re playing this uncertainty game. What role does\nx-ray play in terms of making a very critical decision as to whether or not this\nperson should come back, and what role does x-ray play in terms of stabilizing\nthe individual for the return and the reentry?\nThere\'s a couple of things that I want to mention about the current development\nof x-ray for the space station.\nThe attitude was to provide a simple\nradiographic tool that provided very high quality and had to be hospital-grade.\nAnother item that has not left us and has always come back is the demand for\ndental x-ray up there. That must also be a part of the facility. That has not\nbeen mentioned a whole lot at this meeting, but there\'s been a big demand for\ngood quality dental x-rays.\nAs currently designed, the x-ray imaging should provide us state-of-the-art\nhospital-grade quality for x-rays; there are differences from the hospitalgrade, and those have to be taken into account. For example, if you are trying\nto do pneumothorax and you have a patient moving or coughing and who is not\nterribly cooperative, it will be hard to get a good quality image from the\npresently-designed system. What we will have to do in that case is go to a high\npower output which will require some specialized power supply from the space\nstation to provide us with the instantaneous photograph.\nguest ion :\n\nHow about the Lexiscope?\nAt the time, the Lexiscope was recognized as a possibility, and the uses were\nlimited. As far as the diagnostic capability that the committee was looking\nfor, they pretty well nixed the Lexiscope because its image quality and\nversatility is very limited. It is confined to limited types of diagnoses. It\nwould be useful; I wouldn\'t count out its utility. It all depends upon what\nlevel of care is decided on.\n\n57\n\nINDIVIDUAL\n\nPRESENTATIONS\n\nPresenter: Alan Wu, Ph.D.\nTopic:\nt.\n\n..\n\nRequirements and Considerations for\nClinical Laboratory Capabilities\n\nI\'m in a similar position as Lou Wagner in that I, too, am not a physician, so\nmuch of what we are going to try to configure depends upon what is needed and\nwhat can be done in a real situation. But the consensus I\'ve been getting so\nfar is that there are certain laboratory capabilities that are needed, and we\'re\nnot talking about high energy, high volume, and high expense like radiographic\nimaging. In fact, the prototype instrument you\'ve seen is fairly compact, and\nit can do a lot of things we haven\'t even talked about yet i.e., things such as\nmaintenance of health and delivery of regular care. If you are going to be on\nthe space station for 90 days, you will require some maintenance physical exams,\nsince there is evidence of bone and muscle loss and a high propensity for kidney\nstones. Even so, I think just for regular maintenance, we will need a Clinical\nChemistry Analyzer and that\'s not even counting the acute care needs that this\nanalyzer can deliver. One thing that you probably have begun to appreciate is\nthe impact on pharmacy in terms of central supply is the amount of disposable\nreagents, and Ken mentioned that once you have invested and justified a\nchemistry analyzer or some other analyzers are needed, then to supply them is\nsomewhat of a trivial task, because these things really take up very little\nspace.\n\nI didn\'t show you\ncould do a sodium\nfoot could last\ncapabilities that\n\n.I\n\nbut a slide is about 1" X 1" X 1/4" thick. With this, you\nor potassium or calcium. Therefore, a box that is one cubic\nyou for nine months or 90 days, and you have all the\nyou would need.\n\nFirst, you need to justify what kinds of tests that you need on there. The\nanalyzer can do a number of things. The list of elements has not been looked\nat yet, and a consultation panel needs to be put together similar to the\nPharmacy/Central Supply panel to address those issues. For example, we can\nmeasure CKMB for acute myocardial infarction; we can make calcium measurements;\nwe can analyze urine; we can analyze CSF fluid. The issue for CSF and pleural\nfluid is do you need to get a sample? Are you going to justify an lumbar\npuncture? Are you going to justify pericardiocentesis or pleuracentesis? If\nyou can\'t justify these procedures, then there\'s no point in providing the\nlaboratory service. If you are not going to do punctures, then let\'s omit the\nlab tests associated with it.\nOne thing that hasn\'t been mentioned, and again, I\'m getting a sense that it is\nreally needed, is therapeutic drug monitoring. If you have a burn patient and\nyou put him on vancomycin, then it\'s just a quarter of a step further to do the\ntherapeutic monitoring. These things don\'t exist exactly as we need them right\nnow, but I think they will very soon. If you are concerned about renal function\n\n59\n\nin a burn patient that you\'re putting on vancomycin, then I think monitoring\nwould be a key issue.\nIf you are going to treat someone with anti-depressants because of psychiatric\nIt\'s not a\ndisorder, then I think therapeutic monitoring is again important.\nbig giant step in terms of instrumentation; you already have this. It does\nrequire, however, some chemistry that needs to be done between now and 1997.\nIf you are going to be treating astronauts with digoxin, which I heard today,\nand if you are going to be looking at procainamide and quinidine, you already\nhave the instrumentation there, and you need to take the next logical step.\nNow what about downsizing? I heard some things which we can do to decrease\nweight from the laboratory\'s perspective. I think the answer there is yes. One\narea that we hope to be addressing soon is whole blood versus serum. If we can\nget rid of the centrifuge and make these tests available on whole blood, they\nwill s e n e a lot of purposes. Get rid of the centrifuge which is a fairly heavy\npiece of equipment. It is labor-intensive as someone has to centrifuge tubes.\nThe other fluid issues which we have addressed will be eliminated when we switch\nto whole blood. I think this is something our laboratory people need to get to\nwork on in order to make these analyses possible.\nIn terms of coagulation, I\'ve heard throughout the last couple of days that\nthat\'s something which may, or may not, be needed. There is a space allocated\nfor the rack. If you are going to have a coagulation instrument, then you might\nas well perform all the tests that are associated with it because the investment\nin time and space will have been made.\nIf PT and PTT can be justified, then go ahead and add fibrin split products and\nfibrinogen; they don\'t cost you any more in terms of space. These assays can\nprovide other information that the PT and PTT can\'t.\nCan we miniaturize this\nanalyzer and convert it into a single instrument that will do all the clinical\nchemistry as well as coagulation times? The state-of-the-art doesn\'t permit\nthat right now, but in seven years this may be possible.\nI think it is\nrealistic for us to specify now that which will be needed at some future time\neven if they are not available today. We\'re not talking a lot of added space\nin the station, so I think you should try to put in what you need. If PT and\nPTT is what you want, I\'d say, "Put it in." It\'s not going to make or break the\nscrub issue here.\nIn terms of microbiology, I would just mention that is going to be part of the\nEnvironmental Systems group. But I think the Health Maintenance group should\nalso maintain a careful eye on that because it is not just enough to identify\nthat there are microorganisms floating in the atmosphere. You need to also be\nable to identify what has infected the astronauts.\nWhen we talk about\nmicrobiology, it also important to mention susceptibility testing, so that you\ncan select the appropriate antibiotic therapy. These are not the kinds of\nthings that other people are going to be able to address.\nWhen talking about\nviral diseases, somebody mentioned hepatitis and herpes. I think these things\nare also not going to be easily accomplished using the basic equipment that the\nresearch microbiologist would have onboard for use research purposes. You are\nnot going to be able to do serology testing. I\'m not saying necessarily that\n\n60\n\n\'..\n\nthey are appropriate, but if they are needed, then we must find ways to address\nthese issues.\nQuest ion :\n\nIf you have an evacuation situation, how critical is it for us to know what\norganism to treat?\n\n.-\n\nIf you have a rescue vehicle, perhaps not as critical.\n\n.-\n\n61\n\nINDIVIDUAL\n\nPRESENTATIONS\n\nPresenter: James Wurgl er, H.D.\nTopic:\n\nLessons from Wilderness Medicine\n\n*.\n\n*.\n\nBeing at the end of the alphabet has always had, mostly, disadvantages. You\ndon\'t get the good classes, you get bad electives, peoples\' eyes are glazing\nover, and it gives you four hours to sit back there and fret about standing here\nin front of the group. Being a G.P., that kind of finishes it off. I\'m always\na little hesitant; I usually select my forums very carefully about expressing\nopinions. I don\'t have much choice in this one, so I will set my foot into a\nmine field here. I am going to say some things that are not going to sound all\nthat happy to some folks.\nYou will all remember a hippie statement a couple of years ago that showed up\non a lot of bumper stickers. As a matter of fact, it applies across the board\nSHIT HAPPENS. I had to learn that one about 20 years ago when I\nto life\ndecided to stay in Yosemite where our resources were extremely limited. When\nI had someone with a critical care problem, it was a five hour turnaround time\nif I had to call an ambulance up from Fresno. It took them two to two and onehalf hours to get to us and another two to two and one-half hours back to\nFresno. When people like the surgeon, Dr. Turnkey, in San Francisco coined the\nphrase, "the golden hours" boy, talk about golden hours, we were looking at five\nhours. We didn\'t have golden hours to deal with. And, basically, I had to\naccept the fact that if I was going to stay and practice medicine in that\nenvironment that the corollary to SHIT HAPPENS is that people die. We haven\'t\ntalked much about that, and I know it is so redundant. Talk about a boob\n\'\nstanding up here, I\'ve been here for 36 hours, and I have a thesis, and I m sure\nthat those of you who have been involved in this program for years must find it\noffensive to have someone like me stand up and render an opinion with such\nlittle background regarding your program.\n\n-\n\n* -\n\nWell, like I say, I\'ll press on. The point is that as I had to face the issue\nof people dying, you will have to start thinking the unthinkable. I realize\nthat in this program, and I\'m assuming this is correct, you think the\nunthinkable. That\'s part of your process of mental negotiation, is it not, in\narriving at some of the decisions. In our meeting yesterday Dr. Boyce divided\nillnesses into three classifications. Class I, Class 11, and Class I11 were\nthe issues that I was asked to think about. I was asked whether as a rural\npractitioner and practicing in rural, isolated environments I think whgt is in\nthe HMF will be appropriate to take care of the medical situation that we\'re\ngoing to confront.\nYes, if you have a Class I or Class 11, it\'s probably good; it many ways, it\'s\noverkill. For Class 111, I think you\'re really in a bind. And you know what?\nOne of the real ironies of standing up here and saying what I\'m about to say\nabout the x-ray business is that one of the issues that was raised was whether\n\n63\n\nor not I was looking at the HMF as a device for keeping the mission there\n(keeping people in space, allowing them to complete their mission), or was there\na thrust toward advancing medical science and the ability to, perhaps, bring\nmore sophisticated medical care to isolated environments? The only thing in\nthis whole business that applies to bringing an advanced technology to, perhaps,\na guy like me is the x-ray thing. I\'m going to stand here and tell you that\nyou don\'t need the x-ray. I agree with Dr. Donner and a others.\nThere have been some observations made concerning the treatment of C-spine\nproblems, etc. and the business of clearing a neck i.e., whether or not you\ncould put a person into a C-collar for two weeks. We put the C-collar on, and\nit hurts if you have neck pain. The thing about the neck pain is that you are\nnot going to make the decision to remove the person just on the basis of what\nyou see. You can have things wrong, and seriously wrong with the neck that\ndon\'t necessarily cause you to have to make the decision to "push the trigger"\nto get the ACRV activated. It certainly is true of virtually all the other\ninjuries we\'ve talked about with the exception of the femur fracture and a\nreally bad pelvic fracture.\nPelvic fractures don\'t require surgery by\ndefinition\nonly the really bad ones.\n\n-\n\nIn regards to the business about the chemistry analyzing machine, I hate to tell\nyou this, but I\'ve had some personal experience with the Kodak device.\nI\nwouldn\'t buy one for my office. Now I realize that you\'re combining technology\nfor this, but from what I\'ve seen using it, it is, well I won\'t go into the pros\nand cons. When I look at a test i.e., if I\'m going to introduce a test into my\nenvironment or even if I decide at midnight to 2 AM in the morning to ask a tech\nto come out and do a certain test and take a certain x-ray, one of the basic\nthings I ask myself is, "Is the result of this test going to change the\ntreatment?" If it is not to change treatment, I don\'t do the test. This\nstatement sounds so much like a G.P., and I know it is kind of viewed with\ncontempt, but it is one of the practicalities of practicing in an environment\nthat is 80 miles from a hospital, has only two doctors, and two over-worked\ntechnicians that are just trashed all the time. I have to make some of these\ndecisions.\nThey\'re not made on academic questions; they\'re made on\npracticalities.\nTo wind up, I was really astonished yesterday to learn about the submarine\nservice and some of the similar issues that they deal with. (Doug Stetson is\nin our group). It i s almost like reinventing the wheel to a certain degree.\nHe was asked about the submarines when they run under the polar ice caps and for\nhow long. I don\'t care what the problem is, whether it\'s a pneumothorax or an\ninternal bleed or whether it\'s totally life-threatening, Doug\'s response right\noff the bat was, "They die!"\nThe second thing was that they are there for two\nto three weeks, no option, no escape, no introduction of anything. The people\nin space are better off than those in the polar cap to this degree. The other\nthing was the saturation divers. Regardless of the situation, they\'re down\nthere 14 days; it takes 14 days to decompress. No shortcuts, no nothing. These\npeople, despite the fact that I respect Dr. Wagner\'s suggestion that we look at\nspace a lot differently than submarine issues, etc., have time constraints\nimposed, the time and ability to introduce things, to either introduce care or\nto rescue the person involved.\n64\n\nNow my last thing is a suggestion that was made facetiously (but not entirely),\nand this is that probably you should send all the rest of us home and consult\nDr. Stetson and the people from the submarine experience. These are people who\nhave experience in really hostile environments - not just the Houston\nenvironment which is hostile enough\nbut really in hostile environments with\nno option for changing things.\nWe\'ve talked about that; it\'s extremely\nvaluable. I also think the training issues could be addressed with the special\nforces people and the submarine people because they have been training their\npeople for years to do the kind of things we\'re talking about.\n\n-\n\n65\n\nINDIVIDUAL\n\nPRESENTATIONS\n\nP\n\n.\n\nPresenter:\nTopic:\n\n6\n\nJohn Young, DDS\n\nDentistry Considerations\n\nI\'ve been with the School of Aerospace Medicine since back during Apollo/Skylab\nall the way up through. People asked how I got involved with this. I got\ninvolved with it because my good friend from the mid-60\'s is Dr. Bill Fromme to\nwhom we have to give a tremendous amount of credit as the NASA dentist. Bill\nand I worked together all those years; it was a real privilege.\nWhat\'s the big deal about dentistry? Clean your teeth every few months. You\ndon\'t go see your dentist every 3 months anyway. One of the problems is that\nwhen we debriefed the POWs. After the Vietnam War, almost to a man, the first\nthing they said was their biggest fear was dental pain because it didn\'t go\naway. They really had a problem with that.\nThe next thing they were concerned about was broken and fractured teeth.\nFor\npeople who are in confinement, this is a very nagging, very worrisome thing.\nIt totally destroys their effectiveness as far as their job is concerned, and\nit\'s not something we can say I\'m going to wrap a band aid around and ignore it;\nit just won\'t go away. Medicating a dental problem of some magnitude for a\nprotracted period of time will degrade our ability to do a job. The other thing\nas far as why we\'re there is that we found that with the Type A personalities\nwe\'re dealing with in a high stress environment they clench their teeth together\nand fracture teeth.\nYou really do. These old masseters come together and\nthere\'s a lot of force there. If you have ever gotten your finger bitten,\nyou\'ll know what I\'m talking about.\nWe do face fractures in teeth regardless of how well we have looked at the\npatient before he went up as an astronaut.\nThe number one thing we are faced\nwith is trauma. From our last flight, we know that mass and velocity are\ncertainly there. I got hit in the face with a TV camera, so we got to practice\nSoft tissue lacerations do indeed\nhemorrhage control during the flight.\nhappen.\nIf you bite your tongue and get the bleeding going, it\'s a major\nproblem.\n\n"\n\nHard tissue ...if we are getting the bone degeneration we\'re talking about, we\nmay have periosteal type of loose teeth and periodontal problems that we haven\' t\nseen. We did not find this in lower calcium levels of the POW; they tightened\nup nicely when they got back, and they didn\'t have any real problems. In the\nzero gravity situation, it might be something else again. We\'re not really sure\nabout that. Of course, the wrench slipping and breaking a tooth off, that\'s\ngoing to happen. And when it does, it is an extremely critical thing for the\npatient, and we must deal with it. Again, we can\'t band-aid it and ignore it.\n\n67\n\nThe second thing is infection. I think as we\'ve stated here, we\'re going to\nhave a lot of infectious agents, more than we care to have.\nOf ::ourse,\nperiodontal around the tooth type of infections are going to come up.\nThese\nare the types of things which are totally non-diagnosable. But they are going\nto come up. So we have to treat those things too.\nThen we have to deal with restoration a little bit. If you have a broken tooth\nwith a sharp edge, you have to do something about it. You must have something\nup there to at lease knock the sharp c o m e r s off and maybe cover over some\nsensitive tooth structure so that the pain isn\'t so bad.\nWhen we started this\nyears ago, we were talking station, Moon, deep space type of protocols. As you\nget further into the Moon, deep space sort of thing then we must face the social\naspect if they have a tooth missing. Also, they may not be able to enunciate\nclearly over the radio because of lisping. You can\'t talk and this is one of\nthe things we will have to deal with.\nThe last thing on this topic would be the preventive aspect. We have got to\nthink about everyday oral hygiene type of prevention. That will be on the\npreventive medicine side, and we will deal with that. The problem that we know\nis going to be there is the problem of infectious agents in the atmosphere.\nDentistry, unfortunately, has the problem of creating a fair amount of\ninfectious debris when we are doing our treatment. We may have to use a powered\nrotary instrument because teeth are hard and you have to grind them. This can\'t\nbe done by hand. Some of the debris generated can be very irritating at the\nvery least, infectious at the worst. We need to control these. One of the\nthings we looked into was the laminar-air particle control system, and we\'ve\ndone quite a bit of testing on that. I brought it here with me. The instrument\ntray fits either the side or head of the table with the little clamp. The\nsecret is this tube under the tray with air holes. It rotates to direct the\nlaminar-air field over the patient. We\'re able to very effectively operate\nthrough this air field, and collected debris is directed into the collector\nopposite the tray. We positioned the collector on the patient\'s chest, and it\nworked very effectively. We built several different kinds of collectors. The\ncollector is hooked up to a suction device. We\'re blowing an "air curtain"\nacross the areas trying to trap the particles and collect them. In fact, it\nactually works pretty well. That doesn\'t say that we don\'t use local suction;\nwe do. Local suction is, by far, the best things to use, but it is not 100%\neffective.\nAnother big problem that we verified during our flight tests was that we\'ve got\nto see what we are doing. We need a good light source. Our experiments with\nheadlights were very negative. Headlights were extremely difficult to control\nin zero gravity. When you look away to do something, your light is gone so the\nother person can\'t see anything. This fibre optic probe turned out to be our\nmagic bullet; it works extremely well. The suction is just a typical suction\ntip, any kind you particularly want to use. The dental drill is rechargeable\nand also runs off AC current. It has plenty of torque. Since it is portable,\nwe can take it with us to fix something else on the spacecraft is need be. It\'s\na dual instrument.\nOur dental items come down to our instruments and\nrestorative materials, and there were some questions about restorative material.\nThe one that is listed on your list is not the one we are talking about. We\'re\ntalking about more exotic material.\nAs Rob said, glass ionomers or the\n\n68\n\n_.\n\ni\n\ncomposite resin materials up there all fit.\nIn fact, we may, indeed, use\nsomething like that. So basically, this is what we\'ve developed for denisistry.\nWe must control an infection; we must control pain, and then the function as far\nas to how people chew and this kind of thing is not as important; it\'s\ncontrolling the infection and the pain.\n\n..\n\nWe can deal with facial bone fractures. We can\'t let people vomit and aspirate\nbecause we\'ve got their jaws wired together. We will have to use, more or less,\nflexible fixation. The thing is somebody isn\'t going to die from that in 45 or\n90 days. It\'s not all that big a factor. So I think we have a fair handle on\nit as far as what we can do and I will be glad to answer any questions.\n\n,Ouestion:\n\nMrk CamDbell\na\n\nWhat does the training of the CMO and his capabilities have to do with what you\nwould need to do in this function? In other words, what training would that\nrequire ?\nYes, we trained the whole SKYLAB crew for 2 days up through, and including,\nextraction of teeth. They were extremely proficient, and they understood it\nvery well. We need to develop algorithms through flipcharts and then if we can\nget a CD-ROM type thing, I don\'t foresee any problems. They\'re smart people.\nIt\'s just incredible.\nOuest ion :\n\nDo you train them in a hands-on practice area?\nAbsolutely, they gave injections; they drilled on teeth to find out what it felt\nlike and they actually extracted teeth.\n\n69\n\nWORKING GROUP PRESENTATIONS\nINTRODUCTION\nISSUES DISCUSSED\n\n.During the seminar, the participants were divided into five working groups.

What would you\nadd or delete and why?\n\nGroup 1\nSpeaker: Joe Boyce\nRegarding the capabilities which the HMF provides, we tried to break it down\ninto four categories. Categories I, 11, and I11 covered minor, moderate, and\nmajor illness and everybody agreed that we had covered all the minor illness\nvery well. There is no problem with that issue. In Class 11, we saw the\nmajority of problems being covered very well. There are very few exceptions to\nthat and, certainly for up to a 10 day period, we will be able to cover that.\nEven with all the considerations (we went back and forth on whether we\'re going\nto have an EMT who has been trained for the first six months versus a\nphysician), we still see the majority being covered, especially when you\nconsider the telemedicine considerations.\nIn Class I11 illnesses, as we\ndesigned the HMF from the start, we don\'t see being able to cover all those\nmajor problems and catastrophic illnesses from the list. Let me let each one\nof you address the specifics as how we compare to your specialty in another\nsetting and in the wilderness medicine environment.\n\nGroup 1\nSpeaker: James Wurgler\nI have been asked to comment about equipment and supplies. There are more\nsupplies in some areas than I have available to me now in my environment, so I\n\n..\n\nthink that there are some excesses, but I\'m not prepared to ask people to give\nup some of the things that they think are necessary for some of their specialty\npractices. The thing that I keep focusing back on is what is the purpose of the\nHMF and what are we trying to do, and I see it from the perspective of family\npractice which is to look at the common things and to see what can be done for\ncommon things; it\'s the common problems that would interfere with the ability\nof the mission.\nThe question is, "What is the W supposed to do; is it\nsupposed to provide tertiary care for the rare situation that might cause a\nsingle person to have a catastrophic event, or is it to keep the mission going?"\nAnd when you look at problems with keeping missions going, you are looking at\nbasic, common problems. A person with a relatively simple eye problem is\ndisabled or unable to perform the mission. People with dental or eye disorders\n(and neither of these things are probably in the remotest imagination lifethreatening), but they are mission-threatening. The equipment and supplies that\nare available in the HMF, in my judgment, will allow me to take care of probably\n90-95% of the complaints that might occur\neven to the orthopedic issues. I\nknow that this sounds archaic to say this, but the fact is that even if we have\nfractures that are not reduced to anatomic perfection, a person can still\n\n-\n\n73\n\nfunction. In the space environment where you can\'t bring a person down and have\nsomebody put some plates on, screws on, etc., you can still get by with basic\nsplinting and holding things in position. So to make it very brief, I feel\ncomfortable with, I think, 90-95% of the things that we talk about. It\'s just\nlike it is at home\n5-10% we have to call for help from a specialist.\n\n-\n\nGroup 1\nSpeaker: Kim Broadwell\n\n-\n\nThis issue of the mission of the HMF is everything\nis it all things to all\npeople? The H F covers a lot of the things that we\'ve talked about as well as\nM\ntechnology "stretchers", long reaching advances over terrestrial medical\nM\ndevices. The capabilities of the H F are very ambitious. I\'ve always felt that\nway. A lot of resources are available for things which have a small likelihood\nof happening, relatively speaking, but which would have a great impact if they\ndid occur. The possibility of having a crew return vehicle, in some senses,\nincreases your responsibility to do be able to do a bang-up job with brief\nresuscitation and support. The thought here would be, "Is this someone we can\nevacuate?" The opposite - no return crew vehicle, and you know that if someone\nis real sick, you can keep them alive for a day or two, but without definitive\ncare, survival is not likely. I think the overall capability is certainly there\nto do a good job for most of the internal medicine issues. Major trauma and\nsurgical issues are still in the Class I11 category; the patient will die.\n\nGroup 1\nSpeaker: Joe Boyce\nAllow me to speak for Dr. Stetson in his absence and try to capture his inputs.\nThere were several comments made in comparison to the submarine environment,\ni.e., how we compare to their environment. We thought we were more capable in\nterms of overall equipment than a submarine environment.\nCertainly, the\ntraining issue is one which is at variance with ours. When we said EMT, we\nmeant a person that we could train for six months, what we could do in that\ntime, that\'s how we define the EMT issue. Compared with the Navy independent\nduty corpsman you heard yesterday, there were several years of training involved\nand a lot of clinical hands-on training. There is a difference there in the two\ngroups. Then we had more capability in equipment and that of EMT (as updated\nOn the subs, he noted, there are about 20 liters of fluid,\nphysician) CMO.\nhalf of that Ringers lactate. There is no defibrillation capability in most\nsubs with the exception of when they do have a physician on-board. Physicians\nare only on board typically when they go on for training issues; they are not\nassigned to individual submarines. There is about a maximum of three weeks to\nrescue. They do have blood intercrew member transfusions, so they are the same\nas us in that regard. They are limited in certain capabilities, certainly no\nperitoneal lavage capability exists. The Navy has an equipment list equivalent\nand noted that it was received about every two years, and they go over that with\na Navy board and have what they call their authorized medical allowances. They\ndon\'t have a chemical analyzer on subs, but they can do limited microscopic\nexams, gram stains, etc. Dr. Stetson noted that some docs "sneak" equipment\n74\n\nw\n\n.\n\n-\n\nonboard the most common thing being the defibrillator although they rarely use\nit. That was the majority of comments in comparing subs to the HMF.\nw\n4\n\nGroup 5\nSpeaker:\n\nOur group covered radiology, chemistry and pharmacy, and as far as the first\nquestion is concerned, about whether it provides capabilities, with regard to\nradiology, it would. It would provide hospital basic level radiography.\n\n?.\n\nI\n\nB i l l Martin\n\n,\n\nThe chemistry laboratory was also found satisfactory with its coagulation\ninstrument, blood gases, clinical chemistry and hematology.\nPharmacy is a problem so far because there are certain areas where it is\ninsufficient. One area is the nutritional products. There also are areas where\npharmacy is heavily impacted by the other groups which it supports. It depends\na lot on whether or not you are going to keep a certain instrument or not,\nwhether or not the pharmacy will be able to supply the necessary materials to\nsupport that particular instrument. So there\'s a feedback system here that goes\nup and down and you go up and down, and that has to have some flexibility\ndepending upon the development in the other areas. The area that I could pick\nout is that there is no pharmaceutical supply for x-ray in case one wanted to\ndo an IVP with some contrast agents, there were no provisions for contrast\nagents, and I guess I mentioned nutritional products there, so as far as the\n"What would you add\nfirst question is concerned, our efficacy now is defined\nor delete, and why?"\n\n-\n\nIn radiology, of course, there is the question as to whether or not imaging\nshould be provided or not be provided. It is clear that you cannot add or\ndelete various aspects of the imaging chain\nyou delete one, you delete them\nall. However, as the system is currently designed, it is much bulkier than it\nneed be. I think there are much more efficient designs that could be employed,\ni.e., as currently designed it uses five imaging sets; I think that\'s\nyou could probably get by with one with current state-of-the-art\nunnecessary\ntechnology which was not available when this instrument was initially designed\nabout five years ago. So there are issues where volume and weight can be cut\nback now with the advances in technology.\n\n-\n\n-\n\n..\n\nAs far as chemistry is concerned and what could be cut out there, the discussion\ncentered around the coagulation instrument which would be the first to go. That\nwould be a savings of 8 lbs. and approximately one cubic foot of supply. The\nnext thing that might be considered for scrub would be the clinical chemistry\nanalyzer, and that would save approximately 16 lbs. and two cubic feet. And\nthen in addition to that, there would no longer be a need for the centrifuge\nwhich would save an additional ten pounds and one cubic foot of supply. Those\nare the priorities we set in that area.\nAs far as pharmacy is concerned, there was a lot of talk about HESPAN and the\nvolume and bulk that it takes up and whether or not that it should be\neliminated. Of course, there is feedback with the pharmacy and it is at the\n75\n\ndependency of everybody else and what support they need to provide for them and\ntheir needs. So, I think that pretty well covers and summarizes our area.\n\nCOMMENT:\nI don\'t have a question, but in our discussions, you had mentioned trying to set\ngoals for the level of care, and I would like for you to comment on that.\nWell, the concern that I see throughout the meeting is that there has been a lot\nof focus from many individuals to relate to their own experiences and try to\ntake your own experiences and say, "How do these relate to space station?" What\nI haven\'t seen is a focus or cohesive effort to try to reach a decision about\nwhat exactly is the level of care which we are trying to do for the space\nstation? I don\'t think the goal has been set or they haven\'t really defined\nobjectives in terms of what is it that we are trying to achieve? What level of\ncare is it? And nobody knows yet; that\'s still up in the air at this point.\nAnd not a lot of definitive discussion has taken place in regard to defining\nthat level of care and what it is that we want to do. The impression that I get\nfrom the group is that the level of care that they want to provide from this\nstudy is a lot smaller than what it was initially intended to be from previous\ngroups that have met on this problem. So I think there has been a lot of change\nin philosophy from what I\'ve seen over the years that has evolved, and at this\ntime, I m up in the air as to what exactly it is that we\'re trying to achieve\n\'\nhere in terms of the level of care and the needs of the group. That\'s why I\nemphasized yesterday that I think we should look at this as a Space Station\nproject. I think that it is somewhat incorrect to take individual experiences\nand backgrounds (such as submarine or wilderness, etc.) and then apply that to\nspace station. I think what we should do is say, "What is space station? Now\nhow do we look at these individuals to treat various things that could occur on\nthere?"\nAnd then go to them for their expertise and say to them, "How would\nwe deal with this? What\'s your experience?" And that\'s the best way to use\nthem. But I don\'t think you should define it in terms of any of those things.\nWe\'re a totally different situation; we have different problems that we\'ve got\nto address, and they are unique. They\'re different from all these other areas.\nI haven\'t seen that goal and that definition made at this point.\n\nGroup 3\nSpeaker:\n\n.r\n\n-\n\nCharles Stiernberg\n\n.\n\nJust for clarification, we\'re just speaking to question number on . We so nt\na different amount of time on each of the Hix questions and not a lot of time\non question one, and, perhaps, quite a lot of time on questions four and five,\nbut I don\'t think I need my full amount of time to make this short report.\nFrom an otolaryngology standpoint, the capabilities, as currently planned for\nSSF are more than adequate. I would not necessarily remove much. There are a\nfew small things that could be thrown out that will probably never be used,\ni.e., a tuning fork. That might sit in the drawer for 30 years and never be\nused. However, on the other hand, I noticed a solution of cortisporin ear drops\nI\'m sure that everyone here has used these at one point in their life for the\n\n-\n\n76\n\n.-\n\ntreatment of swimmer\'s ear. As you well know, you always put a patient\'s head\nin the dependent position to drop the drops into the ear canal, provided the\ncanal is patent and not swollen shut. It\'s not going to work in micro-G\ngravity, so to get around that we do need to add a very simple otic wick, which\nis a small, one centimeter miniature tampon, so to speak, put in the canal so\nit will soak up the drops.\n\n...\n4\n\nWith regards to x-ray equipment, all of us in our group do not have a critical,\nabsolute need for x-ray equipment, although all of us see that in the future\nthat if we look at this thing 15-20 years down the road we want to make the\nstatement, "Yes, it may eventually be absolutely necessary should this Space\nStation become more and more developed." So we don\'t want to throw out x-ray\nequipment and say we will never use it. We may not use it initially, but\nsomewhere down the road, it may become important.\nFrom a dental standpoint, there were no particular changes.\nFrom an\nophthalmology standpoint, several things were recommended. I will just briefly\nread these: such things as substitute tetrocaine with proparacaine, add a high\nirrigation solution, add some sort of method for rebreathing C02such as a simple\npaper bag, a spud for removal of foreign bodies is absolutely essential. Some\nof these things we went over yesterday, I believe. Also add a keeler loop, a\ncult needle holder, 6.0 and 8.0 sutures are very important, a near vision test\nthat\'s very simple and lightweight, penlight with cobalt filter. We do\ncard\nnot recommend a fundus camera, although it is noted that such camera is on-board\nin the laboratory section of the experimental section of the Station, although\nthat particular camera for an ophthalmologist is, as I understand it, not of\nreal great value since it\'s only got one or two colors and has some other\ndeficiencies. From an ophthalmology standpoint, x-ray equipment is not actually\nessential nor is ultrasound.\n\n-\n\nAll of us here have seen patients that, if not psychotic, were in a state where\nthey had to be restrained whether they be in an ICU, intubated, trying to pull\na tube out, or whether they be just a psychotic patient. That\'s essential to\nrestrain such a person.\nThat\'s all I have.\n\nThank you.\n\nOue st ion :\n\n..\n.\n\nIs there a hemostatic nasal canula currently provided?\nNo, but under question three -"What new technologies are developing, what\nmethods or techniques would you consider adding," and under that I would say,\n"Yes, we would need it. An epistat or a nasostat\nthat\'s on the current\norbiter and it\'s been requested (I\'m sorry I didn\'t mention that) for nose\nbleeds. Although they have never occurred, we should be able to treat that.\n\n-\n\n.\n77\n\nGroup 2\nSpeaker: A1 fred Bove\n\n.\n\nWe basically looked at a number of items for Hyperbarics, and I will say a brief\nword about that. If an urgent EVA, which lasts an hour or more, is needed\nwithout adequate oxygen prebreathing, there is a very high risk of decompression\nsickness. If that occurs, you have a disabled crewmember probably after one or\ntwo of these events. The hyperbaric chamber would resolve this disability. I\nthink the hyperbaric chamber is a necessary component.\nWithin the medicine and surgery categories, I examined medicine to list critical\nand non-critical medicines. The question was raised about our goals. We have\nall been making assumptions about our level of care. I would make the comment\nthat the level of care in a three month mission ought to be return the\ncrewmember to full duty unless the illness is very serious. We should be able\nto practice medicine to return a crewmember to full duty unless it\'s a\ncatastrophic illness or injury (at which time we have to save life first and\nstabilize the individual with possible return to duty). That would be the level\nof care we should approach. It\'s not truly the wilderness environment where you\nhave a short-term emergency that you must stabilize and get back to\ncivilization. This is a situation where you would really like to take someone\nwho has an illness that\'s not catastrophic, fix it and go back to work. And,\nso when we look at non-critical issues i.e., the usual kinds of things which\ncome up would be infections like pneumonias, gastroenteritis of various types\nincluding bacterial and viral, skin infections (I think these are going to be\na problem from my experience in other closed crew environments such as\nsaturation diving and submarines - not so much submarines, but saturation\ndiving), at least a remote possibility of a CNS infection such as bacterial or\nviral, (meningitis or encephalitis).\nIn addition, pyelonephritis, septic\narthritis, cystitis, renal or gall stone problems, and asthma are likely. (I\nhave some concern about breathing the particulates in the environment for three\nmonths. Somebody is likely to come down with asthma). Metabolic illnesses are\nunlikely; we\'re not likely to find a diabetic developing in spaceflight. Heat\nstress is possible.\nThe capabilities to treat these are quite good with the equipment and facilities\nwhich are presently planned. When we look at more critical types of things\nwhich might occur medically such as acute myocardial infarction or pulmonary\nembolism, those are events which are also treatable with the facilities that are\non-board.\nThe consensus was that the anti-coagulation or the coagulation\nparameter unit is probably not necessary. I wish to dissent on this. I would\npersonally not like to treat a pulmonary embolism with anticoagulants, both\nacute and chronic anti-coagulation without having coagulation parameters\navailable, nor would I like to use thrombolytic agents in acute myocardial\ninfarction without having some measure of coagulation. It was mentioned that\nwe could use leukocytes but leukocytes don\'t work for measuring prothrombin.\nSo, I think our consensus was that the coagulation unit could be prioritized\nlower; my personal feeling is that if you experienced a pulmonary embolism or\nacute myocardial infarction, you would be very uncomfortable trying to manage\nthe patient without it, but we prioritized it as a group a little bit lower.\n\n78\n\n.*\n\n.\n\n.\n..\nI\n\n-\n\nIn terms of the x-ray system, there was a variety of opinions. My own personal\nopinion is that if I were trying to manage an infarct with heart failure or a\npneumonia, I would certainly like to have that x-ray. We did not have any\nradiologists in the group, but I think the consensus here again is that the xray would be a good thing to have; it probably doesn\'t have to be prioritized\nat the top of the list.\nIf we look at surgical items, we discussed trauma, and I don\'t want to talk a\nlot about trauma. There are, at present, adequate materials to mechanically\nventilate the patient and provide a few days of care. Although something should\nbe said about the nursing care of an intensive patient because the nursing care\nis the major issue. Intensive care will require one-on-one nursing care and\nnone of us can imagine 14 days of one-on-one nursing care in that environment.\nA few days would probably exhaust the entire crew, so there should be an\nevacuation option. I think that was the ultimate conclusion from that.\nIn terms of treating burns, one of the questions raised was how do you handle\nstool and vomitus from a burn patient in terms of contamination and maintaining\nthe products of the burned patient in a closed environment to avoid having it\nspread throughout the space station? The fluid needs for a burned patient are\nwell beyond the planned storage capabilities of the IV fluids, and there should\nbe some powdered materials kept on board to be mixed with water. Recycled water\ncan be used for enteric nutrition and enteric fluid replacement rather than for\nparenteral fluid. There was some concern expressed for the filtration system\nand the condensate conversion particularly about the drinking water in terms of\nremoving viruses. If the herpes virus was passed through the condensate system\nand spread around in the water and mixed through an IV solution, it might have\nsome very serious effects.\nThere were a number of suggestions made as to how to treat burns in terms of\nspecific agents. I don\'t think there is the time to discuss them, but there\nwere concerns about the ability to debride a burn, to coat the burn and cover\nit with antibiotics and other materials. Antibiotics were also of some concern\nin terms of making sure they didn\'t have antibiotics that were being used in\nallergic subjects.\nIn terms of fractures, orthoplast was mentioned. It is a plastic material you\ncan heat and it doesn\'t produce dust. You can cut it with a scissors before\nit\'s molded and it can be used to make splints for fractures.\nIt was\nrecommended by one of the surgeons.\n\nSo I think overall the facilities were adequate. We prioritized the coagulation\nmachine low on the list, but we would prioritize x-ray near the top of the list,\nbut not at the top. My personal feeling is that our goal for care of day-today illness in a closed environment such as this ought to be to cure the illness\nand return the individual to full duty.\n\n.\n79\n\nGroup 2\nSpedker:\n\nRob From\n\nWe\'ve pretty much covered the critical care aspects and transport aspects, but\nI will just reiterate them quickly. Critical care medicine really involves\ntitrated care based on physiologic variables that are fed back to the operator.\nThe feedback of physiologic variables is termed monitoring and proposed HMF\nmonitoring capabilities are superb, perhaps more than one needs. We have a\nmajor problem with providing titrated physiologic support to patients. As many\nof you who have worked in an I U realize, it is not a medical ICU, or a surgical\nC\nIt is really the nursing\nintensive care unit, it\'s a nursing ICU.\ninterventions that are the therapeutic aspect in intensive care units. We feel\nthat it is unreasonable to expect the Crew Medical Officer (CMO) with a geologic\nbackground and six months of training (functioning in a hallway of the hab\npatient module, having to serve as a pharmacist, housekeeper, and respiratory\ntherapist) will be able to replicate the kind of efficiency we see in wellskilled, intensive care unit nurses. Therefore, it is unreasonable to expect\nwhat we call critical care medicine to be existent for more than 48 hours, in\nWe do feel that monitoring\nthe HMF for the most critically ill patient.\ncapabilities for all categories of illnesses should be relatively easy to\nprovide with currently allocated resources.\nIn addition to the personnel limitations of the HMF, there are some\ntechnological limitations that are of interest. Specifically, there is no\nprovision for the management of patient with renal failure (dialysis or\nhemofiltration).\nIt is possible that one could perform peritoneal dialysis\nusing currently allocated resources. You might be able to get by with this.\nBecause of these factors, the critical care medicine group really feels that\nsome consideration for other options for dealing with the most critically ill\npatient is warranted. The ACRV is probably the most palatable, and a second\nless palatable option is a recognition that some patients will die.\n\nGroup 4\nSpeaker: Daniel O\'Nei 1 1\nI\'m speaking as a representative of the surgical group on the first question,\nand we feel that the HMF, as currently planned, provides capabilities needed for\nsurgical sub-specialties. First of all, it must be recognized that surgical\nprocedures performed will be of a very limited nature.\nI think we do all\nrecognize that. Orthopedically, as originally planned, there is more present\non the HMF than is needed, so we have deleted most of the splint and traction\ndevices, added a few small things such as a thoracic extension, a few\nPhiladelphia collars, we felt it imperative that heat and cold applications be\navailable as well as serious consideration be given to electrical stimulation\nunits for the treatment of overuse injuries.\nSpecifically, I don\'t think\nthere\'s any need for orthoplast splints. The heating that\'s necessary from all\nthese splints introduces another problem, and the splints that are being serious\nconsideration already (SAM splints) beat everything that an orthoplast splint\ncan for most major injuries without that extra step.\n\n80\n\n. *\n\n_ -\n\n-\n\n#\n\nGynecology\nThere definitely is a need for D &\nnecessary to have the ability to position one in the\nhave made a strong call for ultrasound because most\ntreatments are going to rely on ultrasound. Again,\nmanagement is essential.\n\n..\n\nAs far as general surgery, again, limited procedures can be performed with the\ncurrent capabilities with the addition of some peritoneal lavage, catheters, and\na few other items. In essence, the limitations of the H F as far as surgical\nM\ncapabilities are those of the clinical capabilities of the Crew Medical Officer.\nAnd those are our comments.\n\n-_\n\nC instrumentation.

The only time ultrasound would be useful if somebody had chest pain\nand non-specific electrocardiographic finds the ultrasonic analysis of left\nventricular function sometimes can show an abnormality of motion of the left\nventricle which indicates that there is an ischemic process going on. I would\nnot consider that a very major need though. As I said, I would think that if\nwe had in the pharmacy the appropriate drugs to treat an acute myocardial\ninfarction and the electrocardiographic diagnosis, that would be adequate in\nthis population although the ultrasound would be an nice embellishment if we had\nit. We would use it if, but I don\'t think we feel it is essential.\n\n81\n\nWORKING GROUP PRESENTATIONS\n4\n\n.*.\n\nTOPIC 11) What are the impacts o f havin or not having the Assured\nCrew Return Vehicle (ACRV) 9i.e.. changing length of\nrequired medical intensive care capability from 45 to 14\ndays?] Impacts o f M.D. versus non-M.D.?\nGroup 5\nSpeaker:\n\nBi 1 1 Martin\n\nDr. Lloyd\'s group was the radiology, laboratory medicine, pharmaceutical, and\ncomputers so we saw ourselves as the support contractors. We believe that if\nyou reduce the scenario from 45 to 14 days, you markedly reduce the quantities\nof some of the supply items, but not for pharmacy or medical supplies. I guess\nthe best way to explain this is that when we did the pharmacy stuff we thought\nabout courses. We saw that if you have somebody here for 45 days and they have\npneumonia, you treat them for 14 days. We didn\'t think about whether it was\ngoing to be 45 days or 90 days; we thought about one critical event. So if\nanybody was thinking about reducing quantities by 2/3 this would be a problem\nfor pharmacy. So I would like for you to keep that in mind. That\'s how we\ndetermined pharmacy quantities, and that\'s how you have the certain volumes and\nthe certain weights that you currently have. From a central supply standpoint,\nthat number is kind of soft, and I guess you can envision that you could reduce\nthat quantity but probably not by 2/3, maybe by 50% of what it would have been.\nSo you need to think that way. Basically, we felt that you could not equate a\n2/3 drop in the length of stay to meaning a 2/3 drop in quantities of pharmacy\nor central supply, so if you could think that way, I think we will be okay.\n\n*-\n\nAs far as the non-M.D., we felt that having a non-M.D. would require more\nsupplies and more diagnostic equipment since this individual will not have\nexperienced the formal procedures; therefore, they might have to drop in a\ncouple of lines since their first shot at a spinal tap might not work and you\nneed a catheter. We believe that a non-M.D. lowers the level of care, and we\nmust assume the worst scenario which is even if we say we are going to f l y an\nM.D. on a mission that M.D. can get sick, say, this will be the level of care\nwith an M.D., and this will be the level of care without an M.D. As this drops,\nthe requirement for diagnostics and telemedicine goes up. And so we are in a\nsense trying to say that x-ray may be necessary, so we are always going to have\nthat the non-M.D. is going to be there. We also\nto consider that scenario\nfelt that the level of training for that person will probably be somewhere\nbetween a corpsman and a M.D., but that\'s a later issue.\n\n-\n\nWe also felt that having a non-M.D. would place a higher dependence on the need\nfor the ACRV. A non-M.D. might treat a particular situation and eventually feel\nmore comfortable with it, but with the confidence level of an M.D. it is going\nto be longer before an ACRV may be used. And, so the ACRV is going to be more\nimportant. And, finally, we thought that an M.D. might be more likely to\nimprovise. He might use up all of a particular class of an agent or a drug and\nthen realize that he could utilize some pharmacology from a different class of\n\n83\n\ndrugs and still get the desired impact, but he might have to use larger doses\nthan he might see on a computer screei. or lesser doses.\n\nGroup 3\n\nSpeaker:\n\n.\n\nCharles Stiernberg\n\n-\n\nWe spent considerably more time on this topic than the first question\nmostly\ntalking about the M.D., but a general statement that we can make about the ACRV\nis that the presence of an ACRV increases the possibility of a crew member\nsurviving a Class I11 or Level I11 illness. It\'s only logical that if you have\nan ambulance to take you to a tertiary hospital from a non-tertiary place for\nlook what helicopters did for\na Level I11 injury or illness (or a helicopter\nemergency medicine) it increases the survivability of the patient. So just\nposing that simple statement gives quite a bit of importance to the ACRV. As\nfar as the individual specialties in our group of ophthalmology, ENT,\npsychiatry, and dentistry, it is very unlikely that the ACRV would be very\ncritical\nthe exception, perhaps, being a serious neck infection or an airway\nobstruction in which a patient needed care to avoid serious long-term sequelae,\nit would be important to have the ACRV to get the patient back in a reasonable\namount of time.\n\n-\n\n-\n\nNow to the M.D. issue, we believe there will be several positive impacts with\nhaving an M.D. on-board, and we enumerated them as such.\nAn M.D. will,\napparently, possess a greater degree of medical knowledge and experience. An\nM.D., through the years of training, simply has a better feel for the situations\nand hands-on type care, putting hands-on the patient, and that type of thing.\nThe time required to train an M.D. to an appropriate level to render health care\nis significantly lower than compared to a non-M.D. We want to address that when\nwe get down to the question on a curriculum to try to train a Crew Medical\nOfficer. I\'m not saying anything more about it now, but we all think that\nwhether you send an M.D. or a non-M. D., a certain curriculum has to exist.\nFinally, and perhaps, most importantly, an M.D. on-board will give more\ncredibility and acceptability by the crew and by the public. We\'re assuming\nthat it will give more credibility and acceptability by the crew,\nThat\'s\nsomething that NASA may have to go to the astronauts as a group and say, "Do you\nfeel that having an M.D. as a Crew Medical Officer is better for you and is it\nmore credible and will you get better health care?" We felt in our group that\nthe public most certainly would feel that an M.D. would give more credibility\nand acceptability. We, at the very least, suggest that the crews have an M.D.\nfor the first few flights so that an assessment can be made of the on-board\nhealth care environment and then determinations perhaps can be made, or changed,\nas to whether a non-H.D. CMO would do the job.\n\n84\n\n_ c\n\n_-\n\nE\n\nl\n\ni\n\n..\n\nGroup 2\nSpeaker:\n\nFrank Thomas\n\nOur group consisted of a surgeon, two critical care specialists also trained in\ntransport, and physicians with hyperbaric medicine and cardiology expertise.\nOur group ran a little differently than the emphasis toward M.D.\nI don\'t think\nit was quite that strong, but tended to run in that direction otherwise. What\nwe did agree upon ...and there was much debate with regards to the M.D. versus\nnon-M.D. ..but I\'ll give you the areas where I think we did come to some sort of\nagreement. It should be an individual who has minimal training as an EMT or its\nequivalent. The person should have a background and experience in emergency or\ncritical care training; he/she should have training or has taken training in\nACLS, ATLS, and American Burn Life Support course; person should additionally\nhave some training in non-acute care which would reduce excessive reliance on\ntelemedicine, because that individual will be recognized as a medical officer,\nand if they have some training, at least they can take care of non-acute\nemergencies and it will reduce the use of telemedicine.\nWhen it came to looking at the various types of individuals and what their\nbenefits and non-benefits would be, obviously, we are moving from a non-EMT to\na physician level. What we did recognize is that EMT\'s do get emergency\ntraining; the training is not as extensive, but it does allow individuals who\ntake it to care for initial emergencies, although they do lack training in\nprocedures.\nWhen you move to a paramedic level, what we find out is an\nenhancement of knowledge of procedures, particularly in airway management, but\nlacking skills at the bedside which would be required in any intensive care\nfacility. When you move to an R.N. level, you have the capabilities of bedside\ncare, but you may lack in procedural training. This, however, deviates, when\none looks at equivalents such as flight nurses who have many of the skills that\nmost physicians have. With regards to the M.D., the advantage turns out to be\nthat he probably provides the greatest diagnostic accuracy. With the ability\nof telemedicine and the experts who will be on the ground, is that component\nreally necessary? They do provide some procedures, but I would like to point\nout that the ability to perform procedures is largely due to current clinical\nexperience i.e., a paramedic, who has intubated a thousand individuals, will do\nmuch better in that particular field than a physician who may have a background,\npardon me, in psychiatry who has not intubated somebody in five years or ten\nyears and has just gone through a manikin before five intubations. So clinical\nexperience will outweigh the availability of procedures.\nIf a physician is\nadded on for procedures, it should be a surgeon because he can offer at least\nsome therapeutic procedures that otherwise couldn\'t be offered by the other\nphysician-trained individual. So I think we would suggest that there are\nadvantages and disadvantages to all of the categories with regard to placing a\nCMO on Space Station Freedom, and that a physician can, or can not, add\nadvantages to that definitive situation with their clinical experience and\ntraining.\n\n.\n85\n\nGroup 2\nSpeaker:\n\nRob From\n\nRegarding ACRV capabilities, our group strongly advocated that this be given\ngreat consideration. There is going to be a subset of potentially salvageable\nindividuals who are not going to be manageable with the resources of present\nHMF, (mainly from a personnel standpoint). But, we also think that there are\nsome other advantages to the ACRV. We feel that it is an appropriate extension\nof the safe haven concept in that it supplies another method of egress should\nthe Space Station Freedom environment become inhospitable. We also thought a\nlittle bit about the emotional and mental health aspects of having some\neventuality for return on orbit. Correct me if I\'m wrong, but this would be the\nfirst instance in American manned spaceflight where the ride home would not be\nup there with you, and perhaps weeks away. Looking at the Russian experience\nand the calculation of a 17% risk of medical evacuation per year based on their\nexperience, it certainly seems that this type of capability would be less\nexpensive than scrubbing whatever was going on with a planned mission for space\nshuttle and getting it hooked up for a trip home, but I don\'t know what the\nimplications are for bottom-line cost on those kinds of issues. We do feel that\nif any ACRV is to be provided that HMF equipment should all be transport\ncapable. There is no reason to duplicate that equipment based on the design\nconsiderations that have already been established for HMF and that it would be\ntested in the transport environment. The patient restraint table needs work.\nIt should be designed for transport as well as for appropriate examination of\nthe patient. The present model is unsuitable. A careful mockup and simulation\nactivity including G-force testing of all the equipment in the orientation in\nwhich it will be used has to be done.\nFrom my own experience in medical\ntransport, we "screw-up" more than we would like to say in positioning the\nequipment.\n\nGroup 4\nSpeaker: John Rock\nOur group took a lot of time to discuss this. As surgeons, you can realize\nalthough we\'re not always correct, we\'re never in doubt!\nAnd, that\'s\nparticularly true in this situation. We have some very strong statements in\nthis regard. Essentially, what we felt was that the fundamental assumption for\nplanning the HMF capabilities was that a crew emergency rescue vehicle would be\nincluded in the Space Station design. It is absolutely imperative to medical\nmissions to include a ACRV to conform to the weight limitations, to limit\ntraining requirements, and to limit the morbidity and mortality of specific\ninjuries and illnesses.\n\nIn terms of M.D. versus non-M.D., our committee unanimously recommended an M.D.\nto be included as the Crew Medical Officer; however, given adequate training in\ntelemedicine, a non-M.D. in the role of a physician extender could serve as the\nCrew Medical Officer.\n\n86\n\n,\n\n_ c\n\nGroup 1\nSpeaker: K i m Broadwell\n."\n\n> -\n\nv -\n\nAs far as the ACRV, I\'m not sure how it affects what HMF designers have to do\nnow, given program constraints. My opinion is that it is an obligation to do\nan aggressive "ER" job for a little while, and if the person does well after\nthat and improves, they stay; if they don\'t, you evacuate them. If you don\'t\nhave the capability, you don\'t evacuate them. The minimalistic wilderness\nphysician does feel, and I agree with the thought, that if you have an\nambulance, you could decrease the capability of the HMF a little bit. Certainly\nthat changes some of the ways you want to think about equipment and probably the\nbiggest impact which would be felt would be on the ventilator. That capability\nrealistically means that you have to operate as an intensive care unit for an\nextended period of time with probably more personnel and not just one person as\nthe CMO. The ability to have an ACRV probably lets you downsize your ventilator\nand not make it quite so smart more of a transport-type ventilator so that it\nwould function in a resuscitation mode and in ER mode and stabilize the patient\nfor a period of time and then could be taken on the ACRV during an evacuation.\n\n-\n\nRegarding the M.D. versus non-M.D. question, I think the consensus of the group\nwas that given a motivated, intelligent, technically oriented astronaut who\nwanted to be a Crew Medical Officer, the brains of the medical knowledge can\nsort of be left on the ground, if you intensively train these people in\nprocedures with the background of an EMT or paramedic experience, there probably\nwouldn\'t be anything which you would restrict the non-M.D. from doing what you\nthe\nwould expect an M.D. to do. So the question of having an M.D. or non-M.D.\nway the HMF is set-up now probably wouldn\'t make much difference. All this is\npredicated upon having the proper training. I would rather have a very highlytrained CMO who went through a special program than a rusty astronaut M.D. who\njust happened to be a crewman.\n\n-\n\n87\n\nWORKING CROUP PRESENTATIONS\n\nTOPIC 111) What\nnew o r developing\ntechnologies,\nmedications,\nand techniques would you\nrecommend f o r consideration?\n\n._\n\n..\n\nGroup 3\nSpeaker:\n\nCharles Stiernberg\n\nWe don\'t have a lot to say because we\'ve already stated that what is currently\nplanned for the HMF is more than adequate. I\'ve already mentioned the need to\nthat\'s fairly simple and lightweight and won\'t\nbe able to treat a nose bleed\ntake up much room. We also believe that it would be important to investigate\nthe current U.S. Army\'s self-contained x-ray unit as an alternative to the\ncurrently-planned x-ray and also investigate perhaps the microwave plasma\nsterilization techniques. Dr. Tredici added a few more things in the realm of\nophthalmology - a miniaturized thermometer, an ocular irrigation device, and\nalso, as I mentioned before, looking at the patient restraint system. Dr. Jones\nalso added that he would like to see pharmacy (or the formulary) take a hard\nlook at the four (reduce the four) benzodiazipines to two, and to have one\nantipsychotic. He didn\'t see much need for antidepressants.\n\n-\n\nI\'ve already stated earlier that x-ray technology in our group is not critical,\nbut we want to reserve further comment because we realize that down the road\nthat may become more important as the mission develops into a bigger operation.\n\nGroup 2\nSpeaker:\n\n--\n\nA1 f r e d Bove\n\nWe looked at a couple of things. The first thing that we considered was the\nmedical database software. Although this has already been proposed, it is,\napparently, going to be deleted. We thought that we ought to, in the future,\nbe looking at a totally integrated patient data collection system so that any\ninformation obtained on any individual or any laboratory data would immediately\nshow-up in the computerized patient record so that one would have an immediate\nlook at the present and the past on each of the individual astronauts from a\nmedical standpoint.\nWe thought that would ultimately involve a dedicated\ncomputer, although, again, that philosophy has been changed in the future\nmultiuser mainframe. Maybe the developing technology and miniaturization of\ncomputer hardware would help that. And, also within that realm would be the\nmedical information database the medical textbooks or integrated packages that\nhelp in understanding illnesses for the future.\n\n-\n\nThere was a suggestion that we consider some gravity simulating system that\nwould reduce the deconditioning problems of the vascular systems, lower body\nnegative pressure devices would be one. Another would be the possibility of\nconsidering some sort of a centrifuge that the astronauts would be in for a\n\n89\n\ncouple of hours per day and spin themselves in a gravity environment. I guess\nthe rats are going to.do that, so I guess you\'ll have conditicned rats but not\nconditioned astronauts. If you had a small astronaut maybe you could put him\nin the rat centrifuge.\nAnyway, we thought that some considerations for\nproducing an artificial gravity environment to reduce the zero-G problems on the\nvascular system would be helpful.\nWe also thought, and I had mentioned this before, that the chemistry laboratory\nwas important for a variety of reasons. In the future whatever new tests come\nup should be incorporated into that. That\'s just an idea; I think it\'s been\ndesigned to do that.\nI mentioned also the exercise testing and fitness\nevaluation equipment, some is there, I think, but is going to be deleted. I\nthink in the future, it might be helpful to understand the long-term effects of\nconditioning and deconditioning in the exercise program to have a fairly\ncomprehensive exercise analysis and oxygen assumption.\n\nGroup 4\nSpeaker:\n\nSam Schienberg\n\nWe have a small list of recommendations. One of the new technologies we are\nsuggesting that shouldbe looked at is the lexiscope. We think that it deserves\nserious consideration as a possible alternative, or at least an adjunct to xray.\nBecause of the problems with transfusions, we know that polymerized\nhemoglobin developments are taking place as we speak, and this should be\nwatched. We should look into physical therapy modalities, including methods of\nheat and cold application and electro-stimulation or tens unit. Consideration\nshould be given for injectable, non-steroidal, anti-inflammatories for pain.\nConsideration for bio-gel gloves so starch and powder do not get into the\nenvironment; and we believe that endoscopy should be part of an on-going\ntechnology watch because who knows what the future will bring. We believe that\none should look into new technology for the operating room table; a lot can be\ndone in that area. Consideration should be given for performing major surgery\nin the future, and we should have the mind set and constantly focus in that\ndirection even though we realize we cannot accomplish it at this time.\nI would just say from a personal orthopedic standpoint, you could get rid of all\nthe pharmacy drugs and j u s t keep Kefzol and lighten the load a lot. That\'s my\nonly personal view.\n\nGroup 1\nSpeaker: James Wurgler\nAs you might guess, we didn\'t spend that much time on new technology mainly\nbecause that\'s not our orientation, and the previous groups have already covered\ntwo of the items that we were to talk about.\nDoug Stetson, in particular,\nseemed to be familiar with the computer world and particularly integrated\ncomputers that allow not only access to information, but if I understood\ncorrectly, transmission of information too. The Lexiscope seems to be a pretty\npopular item. We feel that it certainly needs to be looked at as a possible\n\n90\n\nsubstitute.\nAnd the one thing which was brought up by Howard was the\nreinstitution of some interest in hypertonic saline as a resuscitation fluid,\nBecause of the space limitations, we could perhaps use that. Perhaps some of\nthe internists and surgeons in the room already have an opinion about that and\nwould want to share it with us. But, that pretty much covers the extent of our\nnew technology survey.\nComment:\n\n._\n\nLou Wanner\n\nI like to make a comment on the Lexiscope. If you use the Lexiscope up there,\nand certainly this design, we are going to have to digitize the image and try\nto transfer it back to Earth because you might not have an M.D. up there. So\nyou have to keep that in mind when you consider the Lexiscope; it\'s not\nnecessarily something that could be used immediately by onboard personnel.\n\nGroup 5\nSpeaker: B i 1 1 Martin\nWell, you think we have the computer and we have laboratory medicine, and we\nkind of thought this was going to be really long when you were looking at all\nthese super new technologies, but I think we will defer our comments on imaging\nfor question four when we talk about x-ray. In regards to computer support, Dr.\nMasarie has some interesting comments for us.\nHe brings us into some new\ntechnology and storage medium areas.\nHe also believes that voice recognition technology is coming along very nicely,\nand that it is good for us because it frees our hands and allows us to improve\npatient care. Similarly, he believes that touch screen technology has come a\nlong way. Of course, you have all seen that. Rather than having to deal with\na keyboard, ball, or a mouse, or pulling something around, it is much easier to\njust touch the screen with your finger. I think anything that allows you to do\nsomething with your hands allows dexterity to be a lot higher. Dr. Wu has a\nlittle bit more to offer in the area of laboratory medicine; he believes that\nwe will be looking at a number of items like hematology, coagulation, chemistry,\netc. and will most probably just need to develop this technology towards\napplication in zero gravity. From a medications standpoint, there\'s a lot of\ndifferent, new medications that come out, and some things that occurred at this\nmeeting are thrombolytics.\nA couple of years ago we couldn\'t consider\nthrombolytics as they had to be given in a special time frame over 60 minutes;\npreparation was complex, and they had to be refrigerated. Now we have a new\nproduct; it comes in a syringe; you push it in; in five minutes, it works. We\nnow have an antifungal that gets 100% absorbed. We didn\'t have that before.\nBefore, all we had were drugs causing blown kidneys. Now we have something that\nis an alternative. There are new anesthetic agents that I\'ve heard about, Class\nI11 arrhythmic agents, and there\'s new biotechnology. I don\'t know if you know\nthis,but there are now 100 biotechnology products currently in development and\nall are expected to get somewhere in the next 5-10 years. What people will get\nto enjoy, from the pharmacy standpoint, is the luxury of being able to switch\nproducts in and out because we aren\'t going to be deciding on certain sets of\nsyringes and later on, we can put them in something else. That\'s all we have.\n\n91\n\nGroup 3\nSpeaker: Charles Stiernberg\n1\n\nI was remiss in not mentioning one other thing we ought to document and that i s\nthat someone mentioned endoscopy and I would just be more specific. If we are\nlooking at this down the road (10 years from now), I\'m sure the general surgeons\nand the other specialists wouldbe interested in having endoscopy equipment that\nis used on Earth in I U sessions and clinical settings that are not currently\nC\nplanned for the SSF. And from the head and neck standpoint, somewhere down the\nroad, that would include the use of a nasal pharyngoscope, a flexible nasal\npharyngoscope, and it could be used practically in many ways, including\nsometimes intubating the patient nasotracheally.\n\n92\n\n- I\n\n_-\n\nWORKING GROUP PRESENTATIONS\ni\n\n.\n\nTOPIC IV) Comments on the following:\n\n=\n\nGroup 2\nSpeaker:\n\nX-ray capabi 1 i ties needed\nJustification for ultrasound capabilities (if any)\nWhat 1 ab capabi 1 i ties are requi red\nApproach to decontamination issues\nApproach to blood transfusions\nCapabilities for Safe Haven\nRole for computer and telemedicine support\n\nFrank Thomas\n\nMuch debate on the x-rays individual feelings that probably is perceived as a\nstandard of care, and there is much debate on whether it is necessary for the\nspace station. We did agree that except for chest x-rays, it is doubtful that\nany information obtained will result in any additional therapeutical modalities.\nMost diagnoses could be made without the use of x-ray, and we are totally\nleaning that way with therapeutical modalities that would be initiated. We\ndidn\'t think it was necessary for the space station, but it is probably going\nto be needed for the Lunar-Mars Mission, so it\'s a development that will occur\nat one time. Whether it\'s required for this particular mission is another\nstory, but it probably will be required for these missions.\nUltrasound, we felt, was unnecessary. We felt that with regards to laboratory\nanalyses, coagulation\nsome debate on that whether we needed to have\ncoagulation parameters has already been discussed by Dr. B o d .\n\n-\n\n--\n\nABG Analysis - We felt that continuous C02 analyzer was present along with\nsaturations for oxygen with oximetry.\nWith the use of current clinical\nlaboratory values to determine serum bicarb levels the blood gas analysis was\nprobably not necessary. We felt the clinical chemistries were necessary. We\nthought that microscopic imaging was necessary, both to look at fluid samples\nand urinalysis and spinal fluid samples. Urinalysis was needed to have that\ncapability; hematology was needed, and when looked at the other types of\nequipment such as swan-genz catheterization, particularly when we are talking\nwith the capabilities of assured rescue vehicle, swan-ganz catheter probably\nwas not necessary, although it will provide some benefit. Blood pressure noninvasive monitoring was a requirement, EKG and defibrillation, obviously, were\nnecessary. We feel that all equipment used in a critical care center for\ninitial resuscitation should be transport compatible with the ACRV.\nWith regards to decontamination, I won\'t go on because I think that has already\nbeen expressed.\n\n93\n\n-\n\nBlood Transfusions We felt that crew members typed and crossed would allow f o r\nwarm transfusions to occur\nknowing what their blood type was so that we could\nprovide blood transfusions. We did not think that accessory blood should be\nprovided up there.\n\n-\n\n-\n\nParenteral Nutrition We felt that parenteral nutrition is probably a necessary\ncapability. NPO 61 NPG feedings could be provided up there and probably should\nbe considered.\nSafe Haven only required a SOMS Kit and some additional food storages in that\nparticular area.\n\n-\n\nThe Computer\nI have already expressed some benefits that might occur, but not\nnecessarily.\nIt could reduce paperwork but could also limit accessibility\nbecause the same computers are being used to modulate a variety of other systems\nwithin space station.\nIt could be used as a back-up if telemedicine failed.\nTelemedicine reliance provides a lot of informational access.\n\nI think clearly that what we all felt the key component to this Health\nMaintenance Facility (and probably in the future for Lunar Mars experience) will\ninvolve telemedicine. They will probably be experts in diagnostic capability\nand allow us to provide continuous monitoring and, this is certainly a key\ncomponent with regards to our conference.\n\nCan you explain vhy you do not feel accessory blood is needed?\non that?\n\nCan you expand\n\nLargely due to refrigeration space.\nIf you can match crew members with\ncompatible blood products, type particularly, and you can do that sample down\nhere also to see how well match groups work, you have access to it with very\nlittle equipment\nessentially IV lines. So it reduces the need for carrying\nexcessive products that may, or may not, be required.\n\n-\n\nQuestion :\n\nIf you had the space, would you carry blood and hov much?\nMark says two units of blood back there. You could get two units out of an\nindividual, and if you had more than one compatible individual (let\'s say two\nor three), you would have essentially s i x units of blood that would be available\nfor quick IV transfusions. So I think with regards to an ACRV mechanism, it is\nprobably unnecessary. If you are going to go long-term (say 90 days up), you\nhave sort of reached the end of your blood types at that point. So that will\nbe your limiting factor until artificial blood is available for that purpose.\nThis may be one of our new technologies.\n\n94\n\n-.\n.-\n\nGroup 4\nSpeaker: Mark Campbell\ni\n\n._\n..\n\nWe had a large and long discussion regarding x-ray and I won\'t say that we all\nended up of the same mind, but we were able to at least come up with a statement\nthat we all agreed with, so I will just read that.\nThe lack of x-ray\ncapabilities would make the mission more difficult in some instances. It would\ngreatly increase the risk of central line insertion.\nIt would make the\ndiagnosis and treatment of pneumothorax, chest injuries and other\ncardiopulmonary diseases much more difficult.\nIt might result in the\novertreatment of certain injuries, but would not impact the overall result of\nany orthopedic injuries. However, it might result in a change in the mission\nwith possible impaired crew performance or possible, unnecessary evacuation due\nto the treatment of suspected, but undiagnosed injuries. The less capable the\nCrew Medical Officer then the more important the diagnostic capability of x-ray\nbecomes. However, the majority of the medical mission can be accomplished\nwithout x-ray.\nOne of the consultants felt that x-ray capability was of critical importance,\nand we all pretty much agreed with that statement. As far as ultrasound, of\ncourse, we had Dr. Rock who was a gynecologist who is much more familiar with\nultrasound and not only its capability now, but its potential capability in the\nfuture; he educated us on that.\nBasically, we said that ultrasound has\ndiagnostic and therapeutic multi-specialty roles.\nIt should be strongly\nconsidered as a part of the HMF.\n\nOn laboratory, we did have an opinion about the coagulation. This is strictly\nfrom a surgical standpoint only.\nThere is no absolute requirement for\ncoagulation studies from the surgical standpoint.\nThe most comprehensive\nscreening for coagulation disorders is a bleeding time which requires no\nhardware.\nAs far as a blood transfusion, we felt that the capability to transfuse blood\nwas important, and especially with a critically injured or trauma patient who\nis to be evacuated with the ACRV. The transfusion just being the small amount\nof two units which we felt was critical for stabilization transport. We agreed\nthat the warm transfusion would probably be the best method. We also discussed\nthe possibility of just having two units of 0 negative in the refrigerator. Of\ncourse, its shelf life is only about 45 days, but at least for the first 45\ndays, they would have at least this additional capability. We also talked about\nthe polymerized stroma free hemoglobin. Research is being done, and I think\nthat is definitely something which is going to come about in the next 5-10 years\nand might be a big help in this area.\n\nGroup 1\nSpeaker:\n\n.\n\nK i m Broadwell\n\nI like your statement about the x-ray. Our group spent a lot of time on the\nimaging system also, and they felt very uncomfortable with the management of\nintrathoracic problems like pneumothorax and line placement. I think if you\n\n95\n\nprovide for those, certainly you will be able to manage most orthopedic\nanalysis. You need the imaging capability eventually; you are going to want it\nfor future space programs. If you don\'t put it in now and fight for it, you\'re\ngoing to have to develop it later.\n\nI think the imaging system is worth fighting for and you ought to get some sort\nof x-ray, particular where you\'re looking at hyperbaric-type issues where you\nmight end up with a pneumothorax instance.\nWe didn\'t spend a lot of time on ultrasound and from a practical point of view,\nthat was one of the low priority issues.\nWith regard to lab capabilites, a need was expressed for coagulation studies.\nFrom the cardiovascular perspective, our group thought we could do without the\ncoagulation capability. The HMF is probably a little heavy on the clinical\nchemistries. I mentioned yesterday the overhead for additional tests once you\ngot the machine might not be very large. Regarding the issue of the number of\nurine chemistries in terms of real-life clinical management, it is going to cost\nus a lot to develop the urine chemistry capabilities, and they are probably not\nclinically necessary. You can probably get by, in a lot of cases, with one/two\nurine functions instead of four/five, and you can probably defer some of these\ntrade-off issues until you see how much lab storage space you really have.\nDecontamination is a tough problem. It\'s a difficult question. Because of\nmicrogravity, it\'s very difficult to be able to flood someone with water and do\na good job. You\'ll probably be reduced to having some kind of antidote graft\nor treated towels to try and soak up whatever is going on.\nBlood transfusions are a big issue and others have brought up points which have\nbeen at issue for a number of years. I have been very disappointed at the lack\nof progress in the "artificial blood" field.\nFive years ago, I would have\nthought we would be much further along than we are now. It\'s really hard to\nkeep stroma-free hemoglobin or perfluorocarbons or anything that we wanted in\nthe vascular space carrying oxygen. Maybe ten years from now there will be a\nroom temperature substitute that you can take which will have a decent shelflife and will serve as a good substitute.\n\nIn regards to nutrition, you probably are going to have enough supplies and\ncapabilities to intensively treat a sick person for just about a week or ten\ndays, and you don\'t really need to get into TPN.\nPeripheral parenteral\nas much of that as you can carry is probably a good idea for burns,\nnutrition\nfor people who still may be viable.\n\n-\n\n(SOMS Kit) seems\nto be a good approach to that. The shuttle overview you saw yesterday has a lot\nof good points in basic care and if you add some IV fluid, that may be the best\nyou can hope for if you are in a module without any other medical capabilities.\n\nAs to Safe Haven, to some extent, certainly the Shuttle Hed Kit\n\n-\n\nThe computer telemedicine support\nDr. Stetson did have a lot of say about\nthat; I\'m sorry he\'s not here to tell you some of the things that the Navy is\ndoing in integrated computer work where you have video and a good training and\nrecurrency sort of capability. The HMF has put a lot of emphasis on having a\n\n96\n\n.-\n\n;\n\n..\n\ntelemedicine capability and having some brain power accessible. In particular,\nthe less clinically capable your Crew Medical Officer is, the more back-up you\nneed in the computer. There are certainly times in the shuttle when you can\'t\ntalk with them, and that may very well happen on the space station, particularly\nif a crisis is going on. There is a need to have a pretty significant back-up\ncapability of medical knowledge. You can train somebody to take care of the\nfirst four or five minutes, and after that they should be able to go and look\nit up as if there wasn\'t any ground support.\n\nGroup 5\nSpeaker: Alan W\nu\nIn regards to the first two issues, our group didn\'t feel comfortable in telling\nphysicians what was needed in terms of treating the patient, but we did have\nsome comments about general philosophies. Something that was brought up by some\nformer consultants was this: If you had one situation in which, because you\ndidn\'t have an x-ray, ultrasound, etc. (diagnostic capabilities), you had to\nevacuate that person, in contrast to if you had these facilities, the situation\nmight have been, "Yes, we can keep him on board."\nIf that scenario just\nhappened once in a 30 year project, then you could have justified the entire\nHealth Maintenance Facility. I think the lesson here is, "Don\'t be penny wise\nand pound foolish." A few million dollars here and a few pounds there is a\nsmall price to pay for something which might have really prolonged benefits for\nmany years. You may be able to get by but you may not. The question is\nexpectancy.\nIn terms of the lab issues, I didn\'t think we really meant to diminish the\nimportance of technology in terms of the capabilities. We were operating more\nunder the impression that we had about six to twelve months to change anything,\nto seal something for the current space station. In that regard, there is\nprobably not a lot we can do in terms of some new blood analyzers which are not\ngoing to be available a year from now. Indeed, in vivo blood gas monitors are\nstill a little bit away, but there will come a time when we can combine\ntechnologies. We will be able to measure whole blood, clinical chemistries, and\nwe measure coagulation times in the same amount of space that it takes us to do\nan end-tidal CO, measurement. These are things that we obviously need to keep\n\ntrack of.\nIn terms of decontamination, we had a number of issues here.\n\n.I-\n\n.\n\nWe felt that if\nit was a topical exposure, it needs to be decontaminated, that we need to\nprovide pharmaceuticals, topical agents that can be used to cleanse the\nindividual. The question was, "What was the approach you would use?" We would\nput the person into some kind of secure environment, body bag perhaps, to\ntransport them to an area where they can be decontaminated.\nIn terms of\ningestion of toxic substances, we need to be able to provide charcoal and\ngastric lavage. In terms of eye exposure, I think it has already been mentioned\nabout the need for irrigation and water washes. Our group felt that goggles was\nsomething you should consider. One thing that hasn\'t come up in terms of\ncontamination issues is that we need a database, in essence, a poison control\ncenter available on-board at an instant\'s notice.\n\n97\n\nIn terms of blood transfusion, again, we\'re not going to tell you that you need\nblood or you\'re not going to need blood. But bear in,\'mind, that a lot of things\ncan be treated with just fluid replacement, and if you don\'t have enough fluids\non board then you are closing off one major avenue for treatment. So if it is\njust a matter of having to replace fluids, we thought that should certainly be\nthere. Bear in mind that when you do transfuse from another astronaut, that his\nred cell mass will probably be decreased because lots of studies have shown that\nhemoglobin levels do drop in flight and the longer you fly, the more anemic that\nperson is going to be. I think you have to weigh that into consideration when\nyou\'re talking about blood transfusions.\nIn terms of nutrition, our group felt that it should be broken down into length\nof stay. If you had a fifteen day capability, then we felt that peripheral\nparenteral nutrition was necessary, but for something more prolonged, say 45\ndays, and you didn\'t the ACRV capability we felt that both peripheral parenteral\nand enteral nutrition capabilities and a limited supply from pharmacy support\nwould be necessary.\nWe really have nothing to add about Safe Haven. We agreed that a modified SOMS\nis all that you can realistically provide. You\'re not going to try to duplicate\nthe HMF in the Safe Haven. And, in terms of the computer capability, I think\nthat\'s all split right up. We need very good documentation for medical records,\nfor healthy physical, for lab data, past medical history, medications history;\nwe need algorithms for checklist protocols, we need a medical dictionary (that\'s\nnot included) for someone who might not be familiar with some of the medical\nterminologies and isn\'t going to be able to communicate with the ground\ntelemetry. So something just as simple as that needs to be there and it\'s\nA medical library is obviously\nfairly trivial I think in providing it.\nnecessary.\nThese things all have to be interlinked with the CMO.\nIt\'s\nsomething that is the final link with the operation. That\'s all I had.\nguestion:\n"Yes, Alan, you mentioned if you had one case where you prevented a person from\nbeing evacuated, it would pay for the space station. Was your group able to\ndefine one example where that would occur?"\n\n-\n\nWe\'re the wrong people to ask that. I didn\'t mean the space station just the\nHealth Maintenance Facility part of station. You all have to decide that. Is\nthere a situation that where, if you didn\'t have the diagnostic capabilities\nbecause you\'re being thrifty at this point in time, an evacuation in the name\nof the astronaut\'s safety would be necessary, and you felt, "Well, we had better\ntake him down. We\'d better life flight him to Hermann Hospital." That\'s a\ndecision that can\'t be taken lightly. The more information that you have the\nbetter off that you are.\nguest ion :\n\nI guess the question that I have is was anybody out of these groups able to come\nup with an example where that would be the lynch pin to make the decision to\ntransfer?"\n98\n\nH\n\nI\n\n.-\n\nComment:\n\ni\n\n._\n*.\n\nDaniel O\'Neill\n\nI can think of one scenario. A clay-shoveler C-spine fracture which is a very\nstable fracture. They would have midline tenderness right on the cervical spine\nand fracture of the spinous process at C6 and C7 and tenderness would not go\naway in 10-12 days. They would be in their Philadelphia collar with thoracic\nextension. It would still hurt, and you would think, gee, this person does have\na serious cervical spine injury; we need to evacuate this person. If you had\nthe x-ray to show it was just a fracture of the spinous process, it didn\'t\ninvolve the rest of the cervical spine, you\'d know that over several weeks that\npain would pass. It\'s not an unstable injury, and they could carry on the\nmission.\ncomment:\n\nAlfre d Bod\n\nI can tell you another very interesting scenario which has happened on board\nship when you get a guy who comes up with chronic cough. Not everyone is ill,\nand you could get a major shipboard epidemic because you didn\'t diagnose it.\nX-ray is the only way to diagnose tuberculosis on ship.\n\nGroup 3\nSpeaker: Charles M. Stiernberg\nWe briefly covered a lot of this and did spend a lot of time on it. Dr. Tredici\njust mentioned that if not already available something for conjunctival corneal\nsmear and culture should be added to the list of capabilities. We didn\'t spend\nany time on decontamination issues; that\'s been covered quite thoroughly by\nother groups with regards to irrigation of the eye and various other things.\nI will say as an Otolaryngologist, everybody needs a nose. I mean, think of it,\nwhat is the best filter up there?\nYour nose filters everything in the\natmosphere twelve times per minute - better than anything that man has ever\ncreated, so don\'t leave home without it.\nBlood transfusions are not particular necessary in our specialty unless you\'re\ndoing major head or neck surgery which is not planned.\n\n.-\n\nOn the issue of chronic care nutrition, yes, we do feel that the nasogastric\ntube for enteral nutrition is important. Equally important, and something\nabsolutely not to forget, in the event of a mandible fracture or facial\nfracture, a soft diet or some method of administering a soft diet or a liquid\ndiet to a crew member is essential. Along these lines, we believe, and I assume\nmany of you surgeons will agree with me, that whenever possible, the gut should\nbe used for nutrition rather than TPN.\n\n.\n99\n\nCapabilities for Safe Haven\n\n-\n\nWe believe:\n\n-\n\n1)\n\nPain control\nAs Dr. Young mentioned yesterday, pain control for\ndental pain is extremely important and should be in the Safe Haven\ncapability.\n\n2)\n\nBleeding control\nA method, or methods, should be available to\ncontrol any type of bleeding i.e., from an extremity, from the gut,\nfrom the nose.\n\n-\n\n3)\n\nInfection control i.e., Antibiotics, incision, and drainage.\n\n4)\n\nSecuring Airway\nCrew members should be instructed in basic life\nsupport, including securing an airway i.e., cricothyrotomy, etc.\n\n_.\n\n-\n\nThese are the most important things or the minimum which is needed for Safe\nHaven. In addition, it was brought up that in a Safe Haven environment when\nthings have gone wrong in another part of the SSF and you need to isolate\nyourself to a node, something for sleep may, in fact, be very important. Sleep\nis very important, and something to help the crew members get their sleep, such\nas a medication, would be extremely important in such an event.\nFinally, we are very strongly supportive and feel that it\'s very important that\ntelemedicine is critical if for no other reason than the psychological support\nto the Crew Medical Officer. That\'s all we have.\n\nGroup 4\nSpeaker:\n\nJohn Rock\n\nI m probably the wrong one to comment. You should have a radiologist and an\n\'\nimaging specialist here, but it\'s clear to me that we\'re \'missing the boat\'\ncompletely with ultrasound.\nI mean it has revolutionized medicine in this\ncountry and making a diagnosis with real time sonography you can detect a mass\nin the pelvis, you can follow its increase or decrease in size, and its response\nto therapy. And one of the most common complaints that we\'re going to see is\nthat we\'re going to see abdominal pain. You\'ve got to take a KUB, come back and\ntake another KUB, come back and take another KUB on the patient, but with\nultrasound you can monitor with real-time, you can downlink it to a physician,\nand you can follow masses as they respond to therapy and then you can put a\nneedle and you can drain them\nclosed, fixed! To take that capability away\nfrom the HMF would be, I think, really making a mistake. I think if we have\nthe\nradiologists in this room that they would all say, really guys, of\nabdominal contents on Earth, I can give you the exact size of the gall bladder,\nthe ovaries, the uterus; I can track the size of all your organs, and when you\ngo up there, I can tell you if they\'re bigger; I can tell you if they are\ngetting larger; I can tell you if they are responding to therapy, and I can do\nsome therapeutics as well. I think we shouldn\'t just dismiss ultrasound as not\nbeing applicable for our part of the specialty.\nFor tracking, it may be\nextremely important.\nI\'m not a radiologist, but in gynecology, it has\nrevolutionized our field.\n\n-\n\n100\n\n--\n\nQuest ion :\nThe only question I have about that is the technician\'s\nparticular examination.\n\nskill to perform that\n\nb\n\nThat\'s why real time is so great. You\'re real time downlinking. You say move\na little to the left, move the probe to the right, put it right anterior, put\nit posterior, move it to the left, move to the right. If you have a first rate\nsonographer, he can just look at that screen and tell exactly where you are.\nSo I don\'t think that\'s an issue. I think the technician can follow directions.\nComment :\nNot to mention the fact that you can downlink the image if you can downlink a\ncamera video of what it probably is on vellum, you can do two things at once.\nSo to me it\'s just so critical that we shouldn\'t dismiss it, and I really feel\nthat as a group we should try our radiology colleagues where it has really\nrevolutionized our field.\n\nComment:\n\nLou Wanner\n\nI would just like to point out that sometimes we use the perspective when we\nlook at our situation here on Earth. A lot of times the reason that we don\'t\nuse the modalities is because we have better modalities somewhere else. But we\ncould have used that modality, we just wouldn\'t have had quite that level. So\nI think that although ultrasound isn\'t used a lot, some of these instances that\nyou\'ve talked about here don\'t have x-ray ultrasound and may become rather\nimportant, and it\'s an alternative.\nComment:\n\nJohn Rock\n\nYou know the level of care, in fact, is a combination of x-ray and ultrasound\nfor diagnosis of all of the body cavities. I think that is what we do every day\nand even though we keep looking to minimalize things, if you are in practice,\nthat\'s vhat you use a l l the time\na combination of these two things. From the\nchest, the belly, the pelvis and the head, and as far as I m concerned we ought\n\'\nto have ultrasound up there. My approach would be that the medical officer when\nhe is going to fly is going to take it part of his kit. He\'s just going to say\nI m taking ultrasound with me. It\'s not bolted into the system, but it\'s going\n\'\nto be there when the medical officer is there. I think that if I were a\nphysician going up there, I would say (you know you\'re allowed further walk\'\nins), I m going to take my little ultrasound and stick it in my back pocket\nbecause I think it ought to be there. It\'s just that it wasn\'t on our priority\nlist.\n\n-\n\nComment:\n\nLou Wanner\n\nI \' m not a physician, and I m not trying to tell the physician what to do, but\n\'\nI would like you to think about the following issues: kidney stones are high\non the list of possible problems, and with ultrasound you can possibly see the\n\n101\n\nstone. If you can\'t see the stone with ultrasound, then you have x-ray where\nyou go through a urogram. If there is only one kidney included, maybe you\ngrapple with the question as to whether or not this kidney is functioning again.\n\'\nWhat am I going to do about this patient? Does the patient need surgery? Im\ngoing to have to get him back down if the kidney is not functioning. You need\nto make a decision as to whether or not you will keep him up there and treat\nhim. There are a lot of decisions to be made there, and a kidney stone is very\nhigh on the list.\n\ne\n\nAs a matter of fact, one of the Russian missions is believed to have been\naborted because of a kidney stone. That\'s what I\'ve heard from these talks.\nComment:\n\n--\n\nJohn Rock\n\nThere was an ultrasound machine on one of the Skylab flights, a cardiac echo\nmachine. That was for research purposes, but I gather that the technology nov\nis much better, and it is much smaller and it would not be a large thing to send\nup there.\nThe other issue is the developing contract study techniques. We\'re used to\ndoing histograms, and now they have developed contrast fluid techniques with\nsonography so you don\'t even have to use an x-ray machine. This thing is going\nto evolve, and it is non-invasive and convenient. I think it is something that\nyou really should be concerned with looking at.\n\nlike to comment on the kidney stone. There again is another example of\nsomebody presenting with flank pain radiating down into the groin with\nhematuria. That\'s a pretty easy diagnosis to make. I mean we are not going to\ndo it on an asymptomatic person, and the question is whether they have a\nfunctioning kidney. A laboratory analysis will tell you whether the kidney is\nfunctioning or not functioning and whether you need to evacuate within fourteen\ndays or not. So I am kind of concerned about some of these tests when we have\nother problems.\nI mean they augment our capabilities, but they don\'t\nnecessarily serve as a lynch pin in the direction they go.\n\nId\n\'\n\nComment:\n\nMark Cambell\n\n\'\nWell, Id like to comment on both of those. I talked to Dr. Gontrov in Moscow;\nhe\'s a surgeon in the Russian Space Rogram. and they had somebody who presented\nwith right lower quadrant abdominal pain and they felt it was acute\nappendicitis. That\'s vhy they evacuated him.\nIt turned out to be a renal\nstone, and I think that\'s a situation where if you had x-ray capabilities you\ncould have controlled that situation. If you had an HMF and you had an x-ray\ncapability, you might have been able to do something and intervene in that\nsituation. I don\'t think that I see a lot more right lower quadrant abdominal\npain; it\'s not that simple a diagnosis. Sometimes it\'s a renal stone, sometimes\nappendicitis sometimes nothing.\n\n.\n\n102\n\n..\n\nOuestion:\n\nLou Warner\n\nI have a question on the tests that are available. Are they effective if only\none kidney io blocked? I think you can get into that situation as to whether\nor not you can tell if it is functioning, the kidneys. You could have one\nfunctioning and one not and then you have a situation.\n\n* _\n\n..\n\nGroup 4\nSpeaker:\n\nMark Campbell\n\nFirst of all, the general surgical capabilities of the HMF will be severely\nlimited, and it\'s not due to limitations of hardware, consumable supplies, or\neven on development of procedures in zero-G. It\'s going to be limited to the\ncapabilities of the CMO, and you know that we\'re not going to have a general\nsurgeon, or anybody with surgical experience, so that immediately eliminates\nthings like vascular repair and major abdominal surgery unless you\'re in pretty\ndire straits.\nI think it is very important that the remaining surgical\ncapability of the HMF as to how much clinical capability that CMO has, and I\nthink it will change quite a bit as to J versus M.D. We are going to have the\n"\ncapability to do such things as place chest tubes, and, hopefully, to put in a\ncentral line, close some lacerations, do peritoneal lavage, and even an\nappendectomy and you will need to have that capability. I think it is going to\nbe really difficult for a CMO who is not an M.D.\nTraining is going to be\nreally important no matter whether it\'s an M.D. or not. Whatever decision is\nmade on that or whatever happens, I think it\'s important that whether or not the\nCMO is an M.D., some method should be worked out where he receives some training\non real-life situations and is able to put in several chest tubes and close\nseveral lacerations and put in as many central lines as possible in real life\nsituations; I think that can certainly be worked out. If you just think back\nto what was it like putting in your first chest tube, or what was it like\nputting in your fourth one, I think you can see that even though most of those\nare simple procedures that have a fairly quick learning curve and just by doing\nit a few times you become extremely proficient.\nThe second thing I want to talk about is the importance of x-ray; we had a great\ndiscussion in our group regarding this. There was some controversy. My own\npersonal feeling is that it is pretty critical that we have x-ray capabilities.\nIt makes orthopedic decisions. I think it would be really difficult without\nthis. With any kind of chest injury, whether it is pulmonary contusion or\npneumothorax, you are going to have a lot of difficulty if you don\'t have x-ray\ncapability. The more inexperienced the CMO, the more important this is going\nto be. You know the function of the Health Maintenance Facility, as I see it,\nis to maintain the health of the astronauts and to keep them at a high degree\nof function. If you have someone with neck pain and you don\'t know whether you\nhave cervical injury or not, and you\'re going to have to put them in a cervical\ncollar for two weeks because you\'re not sure of their injury, I really don\'t\nthink that is maintaining their health.\nI\'ll just say a few things about wound healing. We do know that there is fairly\ngood evidence to indicate that the immune response in weightlessness is\n\n103\n\ndecreased.\nIt hasn\'t been very well defined, but certainly there are\nindicaiions that this is true, so I think that you\'re\' going to have an altered\nhost response. The chance of your having a wound infection may be a little bit\ngreater than down here in one-G. Also, we all need to realize, and I don\'t know\nhow many do realize this, that the air will be fairly contaminated on an ongoing basis. The particle count and the colony-forming units per cubic foot is\n100 times higher than it is in this room, and I think that this is definitely\ngoing to have some bearing on wound infection. Nobody knows how much; but it\ncertainly will have some, and will be, the reverse from the laminar flow\nsituation. Russians have performed some animal experimentation where they have\ntaken up some animals, I believe rabbits, and made incisions and looked at wound\nhealing, and there is definitely delayed wound healing. They indicate in their\nfindings, and their papers are pretty observational and non-scientific if you\'ve\never read them, but they indicate that it is very definite and maybe even by a\nfactor of two. That certainly needs to be explored at some point in time; it\nmight be quite critical. Nobody knows the mechanism of that at all.\nA lot of people talk about the problem of the containment of bleeding in zeroG, and there\'s a lot of worry about this and lots of discussion regarding it;\n\n-\n\nlots of methods have been devised to try to limit that\nthings from laminar\nflow devices to inflatable surgical chambers. There are many different methods,\nand all I can say is that I don\'t think that anybody knows how big a problem\nwhether it will be a big problem or a small one, we just don\'t\nthis will be\nknow.\n\n-\n\nQuestion:\nRegarding x-ray, is there any discussion as to what level of sophistication for\nx-ray capability? Do you have any discussion as to how far you might want to\ngo on that? Whatever\nany level of sophistication? Angiography?\n\n-\n\nNo, I don\'t think that angiography is that important or that CAT Scan is that\nimportant, and although ultrasound would be nice, I don\'t think it\'s that\nimportant. To me, all I want is a simple x-ray. I think a chest x-ray is real\nimportant and I think orthopedic x-ray is also important. I think it will help\na great deal in making a lot of decisions as to whether you are going to\nevacuate somebody, treat somebody. There\'s many fractures that you can treat\non station, and there are several fractures you cannot treat on station. The\nonly way you can make that decision is with an x-ray. You could have a lot of\nunnecessary evacuations (maybe not on ACRV), but at least bringing the shuttle\nup and taking them down, that might be unnecessary. It certainly would not\ndegrade crew performance. You\'ll have to overtreat and this will decrease crew\nperformance without x-rays.\n\nWhat about the ultrasound in terms of internal soft tissue trauma or something\nof that nature for which x-ray may not be suited?\nWell ultrasound is not really great on that either. It\'s great for pelvic and\nlooking at things like renal stones which will be real important and even\ncholelithiasis which may be a problem; we just don\'t know.\n\n104\n\n..\n\n-\n\nX-ray could take care .of those things too\nless easily, but it would take care\nof them. As far as soft tissue trauma, ultrasound is very poor.\n\nGroup 1\n\nSpeaker:\n\n= _\n\nHoward Donner\n\nI would like to say a few words regarding x-ray, slightly different than Dr.\nCampbell\'s. My background is essentially emergency/wilderness medicine. I do\na lot of expeditionary support where I have very little to work with except the\nfew things I stuff in my pack before I leave. The question that Roger asked me\ninitially was, "Could you function without standard radiographic imaging?" I\nthought long and hard about that, and my feeling is this. For abdominal trauma\nand such which, obviously, flat plate, KUB\'s, and such are used especially in\nthe emergency department, they are usually not that helpful in the emergency\ndepartment and in zero-gravity with the loss of the normal air/fluid level and\nsuch that we\'re looking for, I feel that we could get by without abdominal\nfilms. The big question, which Dr. Campbell already alluded to, is what about\nC-spine? Well, in the majority of cases, in the emergency department anyway,\nwe are dealing with patients who are usually comatose when you are trying to\nrule-out C-spine fracture as opposed to ruling-in C-spine fracture in the case\nyou have presents with severe neck pain. In most of the cases, I can\'t give\nyou a number, it seems that when examining a conscious patient one can simply\nrule out a C-spine injury due to the lack of tenderness and lack of any evidence\nof any neurological deficit, tenderness, or other signs that are suggestive.\nI think it is very rare that you have a case where a patient presents with\nsignificant neck pain and C-spine tenderness where you really need a C-spine\nfilm to actually rule-out significant injury. I would love to see the x-ray\nequipment on space station, but regarding the question, "Could we function\nwithout standard radiographic imaging?" I think, probably, in 99.9% of the cases\none could function without C-spine evaluation. I think the areas where it is\nextremely difficult to imagine functioning without it though, (and I certainly\nagree with Dr. Campbell) is for chest injury and pulmonary processes. I spent\na lot of time in the mountains diagnosing pulmonary edema without the use of\nradiographic equipment.\nI don\'t know about the aspect of rales and how\nprevalent they will be at zero-gravity; however, usually the diagnosis of\npulmonary edema, pneumonitis, infection processes, etc. can be made empirically\non clinical grounds alone. The thing I worry about is pneumothorax, and that\nwould be very, very difficult to determine whether a patient who is now short\nof breath with significant chest pain indeed has pneumothorax or some other\npulmonary process.\n\nI agree with Dr. Campbell that it\'s nice, and there are many orthopedic\nprocesses which require specific splinting etc., but certainly in the\nmountaineering circuit, most of the time one can assess and treat very\nappropriately even without radiographic imaging and that would be certainly\nenough to get that person down where if, in fact, the worst case scenario were\nto occur and that was if a mis-diagnosis or there was a fracture dislocation\nwith some ambulation or some displacement that was missed, clinically at least,\nthat could be attended to surgically after that. So, again, I\'m not suggesting\n\n-\n\n-\n\n105\n\nthat it would be nice to work up in the space station without radiographic\nequipment, but the question was, "Could I function?" I think, in most of the\ncases, I could function.\n\nI just want to mention that we also addressed the question of the Lexiscope\nwhich is, essentially, a small fluoroscopic technique, and I think that there\nshould be some question as to whether if DRIS unit were not to be utilized\nwhether a smaller, lighter weight, less functional (but still functional)\nradiographic imaging device could be utilized in its place, such as this\nLexicscope. Even though it is very small, even for long bones, it could be\nmosaiced so that you could get, essentially, even a long bone image, and it\ncould be used in a very small coned-down view.\nAdmittedly, for a C-spine\ninjury, it would be probably fairly worthless for pulmonary and abdominal\nprocess. But I think it would be a compromise that would be worth looking into.\nOn the laboratory and microbiological, I think that\'s already been addressed.\nI think the bottom line is whether we believe that the microbiological is\nnecessary or not. Most of the microbiological capabilities will be utilized in\nthe EHS.\n\nAs far as the Safe Haven goes, NASA already has an incredible kit, and my\nspecialty is actually preparing medical kits for expeditions. I had a chance\nto go through the SOMS KIT, which is the shuttle mission orbital medical system\nthat they use; it\'s an incredible system. I think that in the space available,\nsomething similar to the SOMS KIT stuffed into the space station would be a\nreasonable way to go. Assuming that space is not available for a complete SOMS\nKIT, I guess the question is:\nwhat kind of medical gear, etc. would be\nmandatory for safety? Addressing this question as I would on a mountaineering\ntrip, I would say just a very few things i.e.,\nobviously some first aid gear\nthat you would need for splinting and for taking care of soft tissue wounds\njust a very basic first aid kit.\nBut on top of that, I would say a very small\narray of injectable medications, and when I say injectable, I\'m talking about\nprobably IM, not IV capabilities. That would include some narcotics for major\ntrauma and some Valium for the same purpose; it would include some epinephrin\nfor any anaphylactic problems and a very broad spectrum antibiotic which would\nbe used empirically (which would probably be something like CIPRO). Also, you\nmight include what I call, in expeditionary medicine, a non-steroidal\ninflammatory such as ibuprofen or other pain reliever etc. and probably an oral\nnarcotic. Also, I would include a splint device such as we\'ve seen, and that\'s\nabout it. I tend to be fairly minimalistic.\nPrrestion:\nWhat would happen if you had more room, than for the SOMS Kit, say? Would you\nuse that space up, and, if so, how would you use it?\n\nAs far as carrying additional medical gear, then I would consider including some\nIV capability. Currently the SOMS doesn\'t include much IV capability. I would\nprobably include enough fluid to trauma resuscitate. I say resuscitate - it\'s\n\n106\n\n.-\n\n-\n\nhard to know how much is enough\nit would depend upon the trauma or at least\nenough to initially stabilize one patient from any traumatic episode. How much\nI don\'t know, but a good start would be 6 liters of something like normal saline\nor lactated Ringers, with some blood tubing and pressure infusion devices.\n\n.\n\nOne last thing which I might include would be possibly something like a Kendrick\ntraction, and the reason for that is that there are a lot of things that we\ncan\'t do a lot about\ncertainly in the mountain environment and, perhaps, in\na Safe Haven environment. But following major traumas, specifically fractured\nfemur, oftentimes, there is not enough fluid to fully resuscitate one of these\npatients. But we\'re talking about ground transport time back to DCMF for a\nperiod of time and stabilizing the patient during major femoral trauma. You can\ndo a lot to stabilize these patients hemodynamically just by a simple traction\nsystem .\n\n-\n\n-\n\nr\n\n..\n\nOuestion:\nThe equipment in Safe Haven is an interesting topic. When you build this\ncapability, how big do you get? You start with a crew of eight. Would you go\nin with the point of departure of looking at one person, or are you looking at\n(in an emergency situation where something incredible has happened? How would\nyou approach it if you had multiple injuries, or are you going to approach it\nas a simple injury?\nThat\'s a good question. On an expedition, I usually approach it as if one\nclimber is injured. That\'s usually how I pack in terms of major trauma. The\nproblem with the space station is certainly toxic eaxposure, a number of\ninhalation injuries or burn injury where there is an explosion and where you\'re\ndealing with more than one traumatized patients. If you are asking me, I can\'t\ntell you. Obviously, these things are hard to predict. I would, for Safe\nHaven, probably try to do a bang-up job on a single patient, and if a major\ncatastrophe occurs in Safe Haven, you would just have to do the best you can.\n\n107\n\nWORKING GROUP PRESENTATIONS\nI\n\nTOPIC V)\n\nHw would you approach the training for the Crew Medical\no\nOfficer (CMO) starting from an EMT level o f knowledge?\n\nGroup 4\nSpeaker: John Rock\n-.\n\nOur group spent a great deal of time talking about the training issues.\nObviously it is extremely important to the many aspects of the Health\nMaintenance Facility. We felt that the first objective should be development,\nincluding cognitive or knowledge and skills. They should be very specific and\nin a very concise manner.\nAn operations manual should be developed with\ndecision trees especially if the Crew Medical Officer is a non-M.D. and all of\na sudden you had to evacuate safe haven, so that you could have a document which\nwould back-up your telemedicine if you will; but also if you didn\'t have\ntelemedicine, he could function on his own or if you had problems with\ncommunication. To attain the required skills, we felt strongly that simulations\n(mock-ups if you will) should be created so that all of the procedures could be\nperformed at 1-G. As Dr. Jones had mentioned about the pancake situation, I\nthink that certainly applies in this situation.\nTraining should be on a regular basis in a hospital with medical status,\nspecifically if they are not an M.D.\nPoints were also made about procedures\nin the KC-135 to again simulate microgravity. It was really stressed that these\nindividuals be identified early on and placed into, if you will, a CMO pool to\nallow them the opportunities on a regular basis very early to start getting this\ntraining. This would allow not six month intensive, but perhaps, 3 - 4 years\nprior to the mission to have the kinds of experiences that would broaden their\nfund of knowledge.\nAlthough we don\'t like to talk about it, we felt it\nimportant to identify criteria for this qualification, because all of us agree\nthat familiarity does not correlate to competence. So we have to come up with\nsome sort of way to evaluate performance and make decisions as to whether these\nindividuals will function adequately in their capacity as a Crew Medical\nOfficer .\n\n-_\n\nOnce the crew has been identified, a ground-based physical should be performed,\nif you will, should be performed by the CMO under the supervision of the flight\nsurgeon and he/she should become knowledgeable concerning the clinical history\nof all the crew personnel.\nThis should not be an acquired knowledge up in the\nspace station. This person should be very familiar about the history of the\npotential patients for whom he/she will care. It was stressed earlier that\nthese individuals should undergo or be periodically credentialed on ACLS/ATLS\ncourses. Someone else mentioned the burn course which I think is periodically\nindicated as well. And, finally, it was stressed and discussed that we should\nnot forget that general first aid training should be provided for all crew\nmembers who will be on the space station.\n\n10 9\n\nGroup 1\nSpeaker: Howard Donner\nWe spent some time, of course, talking about this and the experience in our\ngroup was the remote medicine/wilderness, submarine, etc.\nMy specific\nexperience comes from spending many years teaching mountain guides, specifically\nthese sorts of fairly high-level medical skills. It\'s impressive what mountain\nguides are taught to do.\nMountain Guide Training goes far beyond what is\nconsidered general, accepted first-aid practice, and there has been tremendous\nsuccess in this area. Non-medical people, specifically motivated, bright, adept\nmountain guides can become proficient with fairly sophisticated medical\ntechniques. In the Alaskan Outback, they have an incredibly extensive field\nhealth worker system.\nThe reason the system works well is because the\nphysicians are in touch\nnot by telemedicine, which we, hopefully, will have\nthe luxury of\nbut simply by telephone line with the field health workers.\nI\'m not suggesting this on space station, but just to give you a feeling for how\noptimistic I am. These field workers, oftentimes, will only receive as little\nas six weeks of specialized training and go out in the field. Certainly that\nis inadequate by most standards, but in conjunction with talking at length with\nbase station physicians in Anchorage, the system works fairly well surprisingly well! But, the bottom line for space station is this\nthese guys\nneed to be volunteers; not military volunteers mind you, but true volunteers.\nThat means that these are personnel that are going to be motivated and want t h i s\nposition. NASA should not come around and say, "Look, I want you to be the Crew\nMedical Officer for space station next mission." There are some incredibly\nmotivated non-M.D. types. There is a mechanical engineer over on the shuttle\nside who reads JAMA, stays up with all the current medical literature and who\nis probably better read than most of the physicians.\nA non-M.D. who is\nextremely motivated would make an excellent Crew Medical Officer despite his\nlack of medical training.\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\nOne specific idea that we had to increase the level of motivation in potential\nmedical officers was to avoid launching them into a curriculum of basic sciences\nwhere they would be sitting like we did in medical school listening to a lot of\nthings which would seem rather esoteric and in no way connected with their\nreality. I would send these candidates to a regular EMT course so that they\ncan immediately get out into the field and get some hands-on training, feel\ncompetent working with splints, moving patients, maintaining airways, dealing\nwith emergencies, CPR, etc. and then after they feel motivated and slightly\ncompetent in dealing with basic medical problems, then, I think you can safely\nthrow them into their 5-6 month basic medical science course. Just be sure to\nallow them a month or so to get reved up and get their hands dirty.\nJoe Boyce has already outlined a curriculum that I won\'t spend time on now.\nHost of the things in that curriculum would be obvious. I would like to stress\nthat this should not just be didactic; in fact, not even be linked to emergency\nroom located clinical experience, but training should stress field experience.\nThese guys need to be flying air ambulances; they need to be out in ambulances\ni n the field, even on search and rescue missions, etc. so they can get out there\nand get moving on some of these things way out of the normal, controlled\nenvironment that most of us trained in. I think it is important to develop an\n110\n\nindependent thinking environment. There\'s a big difference, as all of us know,\nbetween being in medical school and even internship and becoming a resident\nwhere suddenly you\'re on your own. I don\'t know exactly how to provide that;\nI think that these trainees should become confident making some decisions on\ntheir own. Specifically, simulations have been mentioned; I think simulations\nare invaluable, and many simulations would have to be created. I agree with the\nA T E , ACLS, b u m course. I would add that these guys need some training in\nhyperbaric medicine. I know that there is a one week course at Brooks AFB that\nis very good, and I would think that this might become a prerequisite.\n\nI agree with the certification. There needs to be a certification and\nrecertification program, but more importantly, recertification to assure\nretention of learned skills and knowledge base. Lastly, with due respect to the\nproposed computer capabilities, space station should not fly without a hard copy\nof some of the basic medical information. In a safe haven scenario, crewmembers\nwould have a plastic flipchart with protocols on "good old paper" to refer to\nin an emergency.\n\nGroup 5\nSpeaker:\n\nFred Masarie\n\nWell I\'m going to take a little bit of advantage being kind of straddled from\nTopic I11 and Topic IV and the last item being computers, I want to add to what\nDr. Wu had said, at least for the record.\nMy field is medical informatics. It\'s really information management and getting\naway from the issue of computers\ncomputers are tools which help us manage\ninformation, and I think that is an important thing to realize. Sometimes\npeople hear the word computer, and they think it\'s Star Trek and fancy\nspreadsheets, etc. But really, it\'s just a tool that we now have available to\nhelp us manage information. We\'re managing information. I shouldn\'t say we\nI haven\'t seen patients in a long time but physicians are managing information\non a daily basis, all the time, and there have been lots of studies looking at\nhow physicians pursue information. I\'m talking about going to the chart of a\ncolleague, PDR, and drug reps. These are all sources of information that we\nmanipulate on a daily basis. And I think that is going to become an important\npart of the Health Maintenance Facility, particularly as we look at differences\nin qualifications of people. We are asking people to be a "jack of all trades"\nup there rather than an M.D. or non-M.D. and that additional kinds of\ninformation sources (tools) that are available to them will only make them more\neffective in providing care.\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\nAs far as training goes, along those lines, obviously I\'m not going to pretend\nto know what are all the sub-specialty trainings. But I think that one thing\nthat I would like to stress is the need to include the information sources. And\nobviously I\'m biased and I think computer-based information sources in the whole\ntraining process because there\'s no way, obviously one scenario/one description.\nIn medical school, it\'s a time when a student walks in on day number one, and\na bunch of facts are poured into their head, and that\'s traditionally the model\nin teaching medicine.\n111\n\nIf you move away from that model, then obviously we can\'t pour everything in you\nneed to pour in during the training. So basically, you will be relying on\ntelemedicine or other information sources. I think that along those lines that\ntelemedicine is to be a part of the training process. Getting to learn how to\nwork with someone who is not directly there helping you and simulating that kind\nof model is important also during the training process. Help these people learn\nhow to use the information that is available to them. Learning what is in the\ninformation sources and how to effectively access that information to integrate\nit into the simulations or the real life scenarios in the training process is\nwhat we\'re seeking.\nI\'m convinced that obviously there are certain assumptions in the work value\nalone that we do deal with this information on a daily basis and that more and\nmore we are going to be moving to computer-based sources of information. So in\nsome ways, I feel like I\'m a voice in the wilderness because if I ask people\naround the room, "How many people are using computers as sources of\ninformation?", I think it would be a fairly small number. Just as I remember\nwhen the automated tellers came out, and I thought that I could never imagine\ngetting money from one of those things and now they\'re part of our life. And\nthis kind of stuff will happen!\n\nSo we have to look a little bit beyond where we\'re at today to where we want to\nbe, and I also want to state for the record that I understand that the direction\nthings are going is that computer-based information sources essentially have a\npatient database, medical reference library, maybe some decision support\nalgorithms, etc. and I\'m convinced that one needs to be able to access these\nthings i.e., that one system needs to be able to access the other.\nThe\ndirection things are going is that these are often free standing information\nsources, and I think that is a big mistake. But, again, I want to state for the\nrecord that people are doing this type of thing now and they have systems that\nif you have a question from your decision support module. they can ask the\npatient database; they don\'t have to have the answer to that information, it can\ndirectly query the patient database. That stuff exists now and I think it\'s a\nmistake not to include this information in the computer-based support system.\n\nAll I\'m saying is that information management whether it be on station computerbased sources or telemedicine, include that in the training program as this is\ngoing to be a big part in the practice of health care on Space Station Freedom.\n\nGroup 3\nSpeaker: Charles Stiernberg\nI had a very intense interest in this because I\'ve spent all of my short career\nin medicine being an educator of medical students, interns, and residents. I\'ve\nnever done anything else. So developing a curriculum for a Crew Medical Officer\nto me is extremely interesting, and I want to add right now that I would ditto\nevery single one of their points, and I would say that every one of these were\nextremely important.\n\n112\n\n..\n\nOur group talked about this at length, and we talked about what are we going to\ndo with a person who has absolutely no medical background. How are we going to\ntrain these people, and what are we going to do with a physician who has gone\nto medical school and has a good medical background although they may, or may\nnot, practice clinical medicine?\nWhat we finally arrived at is that instead of having multiple curricula, develop\njust a single curriculum in which all CMOs have to go through, regardless of\ntheir degree whether they hold a Ph.D., EMT, or whether they are a physician.\nNow that might rub some people the wrong way, particularly the physicians, but\nit would be possible to waive the month of basic physiology and anatomy, for\nexample, for the physician if he had already had it; he, obviously, has had that\nin medical school. It may even be possible to waive that for other scientists\non board who are going to be the CMOs because they have a background in\nmicrobiology or some other life science. But we felt that to develop a very\ngood curriculum, it is only necessary to develop one curriculum rather than\nmultiple ones based on who the CMO is going to be.\n\n-\n\nGenerally speaking, without getting into specifics, if one has six months, we\nfelt that one month of basic terminology, physiology and anatomy and all of\nthose things that would be necessary for a person never exposed to medicine\nwould be first. And then five months for specialty training, including, for\nexample, several weeks (up to one month) in the field with FHTs, perhaps, their\nsecond month rotation.\nWe firmly believe, furthermore, that certification or examination or evaluation\nat the end of this s i x months (or even intermittently throughout the six months)\nis very important.\nIt gives the program credit; it gives the program a\ncredibility to the public, the crewmembers, and to everyone.\nWe agree,\ntherefore, with the preceding speakers who said testing and having a minimal\npass rate is very important. We would also add that recertification (some\ndoctors hate that word) is equally important. Perhaps even refresher courses\nbecause if you train a person and they are not going up for another year,\ncertainly refresher courses would be very important.\nFinally, as one of the other speakers said, simulations are important and the\nlast thing that I would add is after this curriculum is developed (and perhaps\nafter it is up and running), then develop a system to evaluate the curriculum.\nOne of the ways (perhaps teachers don\'t like this but this is being done in\nmedical schools) is to have the students evaluate the teachers. And that\'s\npretty important because among some of the issues which we talked about, a\nselection of the teachers is critical. We really don\'t want to select a teacher\nthat is going to get off into some esoteric subject in their specialty - off on\na tangent. Furthermore, we wrestled for a few minutes (again not knowing the\nanswer with the legal issues) of training a non-licensed person in a hands-on\nenvironment. Anyone can argue the point that, "well, medical students are not\nlicensed to practice medicine, and you train them." As you well know if you\nwent to medical school in the 50\'s or ~ O \' S , you got to do a lot more hands-on\nthings than you now currently get to do in the 9 0 \' s because of medical/legal\nissues in the U . S . That may be a problem that the NASA administrators need to\nfigure out or at least get legal guidance as to what the ramifications of it is.\nThat\'s all we have. Thank you.\n\n113\n\nGroup 2\nSpeaker:\n\nFrank Thomas\n\nI don\'t think we can add much to what has already been stated except to\nemphasize non-acute training i.e., something equivalent to the shuttle medical\nbook, whoever it is up there that is serving as the CMO has some training with\nregard to non-acute emergencies. We also had felt that the core curriculum\ngroup or those people who are developing this particular course for the CMO\nwould be a group of consultants familiar with the equipment and the personnel\nskills and that they would apply (or at least there ought to be at least one day\nor a day and a half of involvement at core curriculum) where these individuals\nwould serve to provide the special needs in space. Relative to the training\nprogram just occurs the routine ATLS/ACLS and burn life support forces so there\nshould be a day and a half or something in there that addresses those specific\nneeds to the space requirements.\n\n114\n\n.\n\nWORKING GROUP PRESENTATIONS\n\nTOPIC VI) Hw would you approach the establishment o f an ongoing\no\n\nground consultant network to support Space S t a t i o n\nFreedom (SSF) medical operations?\n\nGroup 1\nSpeaker: Howard Donner\n\'.\n\nWe have a few comments, short but sweet, but I think they are important. The\nmost important comment is that I think whatever form of consultant network is\neventually developed, it is critical that these people (whoever they may be)\nnot be Joe Blow, friend of our daughter, who is asked to come in and consult,\nbut it should be someone who is extremely familiar with the very specific, and\nsomewhat esoteric capabilities of the space station. So what this means is that\nthis person needs not only to be well versed in this field (which is assumed),\nbut a person who knows what is practical, that understands the capabilities of\nthe Chief Medical Officer and a person who has come to Johnson Space Center and\ntrained during simulations, one who understands the telecommunication systems,\nunderstands what can be accomplished and what can\'t be.\nThe worst case scenario we can imagine is somebody who might be very proficient\nin his area but is quite inept when it comes to working with the system at hand.\nSo a requirement for all consultants is this familiarity i.e., specifically,\ncertification, whatever that means. For anyone to serve on a consulting board\nwould need to show that he has gone through "x" amount of time in simulations\nworking with the equipment and understanding the capabilities of the Space\nStation Freedom.\n\n._\n\nSecondly, how does one do this? Our group decided that it would probably be\nbest to use a very simple system identifying a chief consultant and that chief\nconsultant would then be responsible for identifying other consultants. We\'re\ntalking about the program that is going up in, perhaps, seven to 10 years; it\'s\ngoing to be in the air above the Earth for 30 years or so. This is a long time\nto be carrying a beeper, so, obviously a network is going to be established and\nit wouldbe the responsibility of the chief consultant of each group identified.\nAs far as those groups identified, I won\'t belabor that. I think most of us can\nappreciate the sorts of specialties that need to be represented. I would like\nto add two groups that probably most of us would think about, but I want to\nunderline them. Group number one is psychiatry; I think Dave Jones exemplifies\nthe importance of psychiatry, but I want to make sure that whatever group\ndecides upon a consultant network includes psychiatry. In a closed environment\nlike this, which I have some experience with after being involved in long-term\nhyperbaric studies, it is quite amazing (as I\'m sure some of the submarine\npeople and the Skylab people can tell you), to witness the sorts of\npsychodynamics that develop in these stressful environments.\n\n115\n\nI would also recommend (and I\'m sure people like Kyle have thought about this\nfor years, so this is no news to people working ,on this) that we have a\nhyperbaric specialist who is going to be as important as any other consultant,\nalong with all of the others we assumed were going to be there, like the\ncardiologist, surgeons, etc.\n\n.\n\nLastly, I want to mention geographically that I would like to present that it\nwould be possible for the consultant network to come from all regions of the\nU.S. In fact, Joey Boyce mentioned yesterday that he is going to be giving all\nof the consultants MAC 11s. It would be nice if we could all communicate via\ntelecommunications via high resolution monitor and receive downlinks of EKGs and\nradiographic data, etc. I think though realistically for the next few years we\nwill have to assume that the consultant network will have to be based out of the\nHouston area so that the various consultants could come down to Johnson Space\nCenter within a given amount of time and view some of this data as it comes online.\nI would like to hope that in the future with the advent of more\nsophisticated telecommunications systems that we could have consultants in San\nFrancisco, New York City, and anywhere in between. Thanks.\n\n.-\n\nGroup 5\nSpeaker:\n\nFred Masarie\n\nOur feeling was that the solution to the telemedicine issue ought to be a\npractical one and that we ought to take advantage of the local resources in the\nHouston area.\nI think that all these group specialties involved are wellrepresented here. The proximity to Johnson Space Center is a big plus and our\ngroup proposed possibly setting up a mock-up of the command center for the\ndownlink medicine people and crew. One of those would be, obviously, at Johnson\nSpace Center, however, another would be located in the medical center complex\nin Houston that would be tied to a central command center that people could\naccess and come to because of the proximity of all of the sub-specialists. We\ndiscussed that what you need to have a close relationship/association with\nsomeone like the medical center downtown would have a contractual arrangement\nwith NASA to provide that capability and that the individual department would\nmanage the call schedule for the individuals that would fill the different subspecialties.\n\nWe also discussed that the ground consultants (again, echoing the others) can\'t\njust be experts in their field, and probably more importantly, they must have\na sense of what resources are available up there. Some of the unknowns, what\nthings happen in zero-G, at least have some idea that this is a different\nenvironment with different kinds of needs. So there needs to be additional\ntraining on an on-going basis for these ground consultants.\nIt is also\nobviously important to the ground consultants to have access to the information\nthat is generated from the equipment on the space station. I think it is also\nprobably important for them to have access to the same information resources\n(again, since that\'s my own area, I have to be tooting that horn). I think that\nit is important for them t o have essentially a copy of the information system\nthat\'s up there. Part of the telemedicine link should be educational, for\nexample, maybe space station CMOS called for something that they could have\n\n116\n\ntaken care of themselves. Through telemedicine, they could be directed to the\nappropriate chapter and verse in the information that they have up there. So\nit would be nice for them to have access to the same information that\'s on the\nspace station.\n\nI\n\nI\n\n.\n\nGroup 3\nSpeaker: Charles M. Stiernberg\nOnce again, this is a topic that I\'m very, very interested in, and I think it\nties in extremely well with Topic V that we just went over and that\'s developing\na curriculum. Because think of this just for a minute when a teacher is asked\nto develop a course or give a lecture on a topic, he goes to "bone-up" on that\nsubject so that he knows more about the topic than is needed to give the lecture\ni.e., if you\'re asked to give a lecture on the treatment of broken femurs, even\nif you\'re in orthopedics, especially if you\'re going to be talking to orthopods,\nyou go "bone-up" on that subject so that you know more about it than is needed\nto give the lecture.\nTherefore, the teachers of the curriculum and the\nconsultants need to know as much, if not more, about these special needs of the\nspace station environment than the people that they are teaching. They have to\nknow as much as possible so I can well imagine a consultant and a teacher in\nthis curriculum, in some instances, may be one and the same person.\n\n-\n\nWe felt like in our group that a central group of consultants would be\nimportant, but that below that level, a network of consultants would be equally\nimportant, the details of which I can\'t speak to. However, I can imagine a\nscenario where you have an anesthesiology consultant as your primary\nanesthesiology consultant and that person may want to go to the American Society\nof Anesthesia and ask the President to form a committee on space medicine if one\ndoesn\'t exist so that he can meet with people in his specialty who have special\nexpertise beyond what he has. There may be a lot of specialists out there, but\nlike in otolaryngology, you have otologists, you have neurotologists and you\nhave people who are specialists in sinuses. Therefore, a network of 4-5 people\nbelow the primary consultant would be important. Consultants don\'t necessarily\nhave to be physicians; it might be equally important to have a flight nurse\nconsultant to ask questions about nursing needs, and that is going to be a big\nthing should a crewmember get sick.\n\n.-\n\nWe also felt like locality of the consultants may be important and that it\nprobably be best determined by the number of times the individual will need to\ncome here on location for training to be a consultant and how often and how\nquickly they need to get here.\nFinally, in the practical part of the practice of medicine, I think that anybody\nwho does practice medicine understands that there needs to be motivation for the\nconsultant.\nNASA or whomever is picking consultants needs to pick people who\nare highly motivated. How do you motivate people then? Well, certainly you\nneed to pick people who are interested in the subject matter. There may be\nother incentives that they can dream up; perhaps the most important incentive,\neven more so than financial if that plays a part, is the incentive of pats on\nthe back and telling them, "Gee, we really need you; this is important" - that\n\n117\n\ntype of thing. Dr. Jones made that comment, and I just want to echo that I\nthink it is extremely important and may be the most important motivator for\nconsultants because they have to be available. Thank you.\n\nGroup 2\n\nSpeaker:\n\nRob From\n\nI get the opportunity of recapitulating what everyone else has said. We really\nhad very little else to add except that we wanted to emphasize that we feel that\nthe consultant network would be a working group. It would not be adequate to\nhave preselected a zillion different people who didn\'t have an ongoing working\nrelationship with those individuals who have primary responsibility in the NASA\norganization and the contract organization.\nBack to the question that was raised regarding training and certification legal\nstatus.\nAt least in the State of Texas, a physician can delegate any\nresponsibility to anyone, and I delegate my medical responsibilities to nurses\nand paramedical personnel daily. The Texas Medical Practice Act creates no\ndifficulty whatsoever, particularly if you run people through EMT training.\nWe thought that immediate or quick access to video links was probably an\nimportant component of the telemedicine capabilities and thus, at least for the\nnear future, that there should be a limit on geographic location of consultants,\nthough certainly not limited to JSC since we have other NASA facilities\nthroughout the United States. We thought that these individuals would require\nF facilities, but also with space station\nongoing familiarization with the "\nmissions because the toxicologic environment may change with each mission. New\nhazards may be taken into the space station environment, so we wouldn\'t think\nthat this could be a static relationship. It would have to be a dynamic one.\nWe thought very, very strongly that the consultant network should be the\ntraining group also. Not just so they would be familiar with the limitations\nof the individuals, but also because there would be some personal\nfamiliarization with the Crew Medical Officer. We felt that CMO confidence could\nbe increased through at least some kind of one-on-one relationship with the\nconsultant network.\nRegarding the discussion about having a hospital or medical school department\nresponsible for assigning a call list, I think motivationally that\'s probably\nnot reasonable.\nYou need to select individuals who are interested in\nparticipating in this endeavor and not have the Chairman of Cardiology simply\nassign someone to be on call.\n\nGroup 4\nSpeaker: Daniel O\'Neill\nSome of this will be redundant, but we tried to hit a few more absolute\nspecifics of the ground consultant network. And some of these specifics, we are\nbasing on certain givens.\nOne given is that there will be a Crew Health\nEngineer on console in the Mission Control Center at all times. The second\n\n118\n\ngiven is that there will be a flight surgeon on console during all of the awake\nworking hours and that there will be a flight surgeon available within 20\nminutes around the clock\non a 24 hours basis. The third given is that around\nthe country video links are not going to be uniformly available, at least in the\nearly phases of the mission.\n\n-\n\nWith these givens, we then had to determine whether we felt direct communication\nfrom a consultant network from the console was necessary, and as a group we\nuniformly and unanimously decided it was.\nThere will be less missed\ninformation, less missed communication and less time delay if the particular\nconsultant expert is sitting at the video console communicating directly with\nthe CMO and not going through a flight surgeon or through somebody else to\nWith this in mind, we felt that you needed 24 hour\ncommunicate with that CMO.\navailability of the consultants and absolute local access as the situation now\nexists, and this would entail a call schedule and that can be determined how\nmany days these consultants and they would by nature of the current constraints\nhave to be local to be available.\nWhat does this availability mean? It means that immediate phone access has to\nbe there, and we felt that especially from a political standpoint, if nothing\nelse, these consultants must be physically available to sit at the console\nwithin 45 minutes to one hour which, again, makes the local access important.\nWe felt there were certain sub-specialists that must be available in the local\narea i.e., the general surgeon or traumatologist, an intensivist, a\ncardiologist, our group put in an orthopedist (I\'m not sure that\'s really true),\na diagnostic radiologist and a psychiatrist.\nWe did voice a serious concern about absolute compliance with the call schedule\nand absolute compliance with availability. Because of this, we feel hospitals\nare not the ones to approach; medical centers are not the ones to approach; the\nTexas Medical Center is definitely not the way to go. There are two very strong\ninstitutions there, Baylor College of Medicine and University of Texas at\nHouston. You can imagine the political issues if one had a little more input\nthan the other. There would be immense problems. We gave Roger heart burn just\nthinking about that. So, we feel that the way to approach that is to approach\nindividuals, not hospitals, not institutions.\nAnd, finally, contracts would be necessary to protect confidentiality, to\nprovide availability, and finally, as well, to limit individualistic promotions.\n\n._\n\nI didn\'t mention the fact that these consultants should participate in the\ntraining of the CMOS because that has already been emphasized. And yes, this\nwould be for sophisticated, very serious problems. For instance, there is an\northopedist on that list, and I mentioned that I wasn\'t sure if that was a\ncritical person to be available. One of the major reasons that we felt there\nshould be immediate access in these serious scenarios is the political\nimplications, and I think those are real and have to be considered. But yes,\nfor 98% of everything that is going to happen, simple phone calls and a quick\nconsultation with the flight surgeon is going to suffice. We\'re talking about\nthe serious scenario.\n\n119\n\nComment : Alfred Bod\nThe point is that I think that by the time the program is operational, you\nprobably are going to find video and voice replication with fiberoptic telephone\nlines, so in a sense, I don\'t think it\'s necessary to have every consultant go\nto sit at the console.\nThat\'s what we would hope. We had to base our recommendations on certain givens\nas they were given to us when we discussed this in committee, and that may all\nchange dramatically.\nWe would certainly hope that they would change\ndramatically.\n\nIm glad that someone else brought up the fact that it is possible to have the\n\'\nconsultants also be the teachers in the curriculum for the CMOS.\nI think I\ndisagree with you in that respect. I think that such people can be selected\nand, in fact, such people would be even more enthusiastic if they were the\nteacher and the consultant. And the analogy here is and goes on in the everyday\npractice of medicine\nI don\'t know that everybody here who ever graduated\nresidency liked his mentors or liked the chairman of his department (perhaps\nthey didn\'t),\nbut I do know that more often than not, physicians out there\npracticing oftentimes (maybe once per year, maybe once every two to three years)\nfind a case where they have a question and what do they do? They pick up the\nphone and call their old teachers i.e., their consultant.\n\n-\n\nThat was the consensus that our committee came to as well. I think it would\ngenerate a commitment and an enthusiasm to have the teachers.\nFor the\nconsultants to be there for part of the training program, they would have to be\nfamiliar with what is available in the HMF and telemedicine network. That\'s an\narguable point, but that is an unanimous choice of our committee as well.\nComment:\n\nJohn Rock\n\nOne of the things that I think is going to happen is that the initial enthusiasm\nfor the first 45 day mission will be significantly less after the forty-fifth\n45 day mission and so I think that has to be taken into consideration.\nComment:\n\nJoe Bovca\n\nLet me speak to that a bit. We saw that in the shuttle rescue services too.\nInitially, in the first couple launches of shuttle, we had all of these huge\nrescue capabilities, helicopters, physicians on every helicopter and all that\nstuff. After about 6 or 7 missions, the ejector seats went away. Right around\nthat same time, physicians dropped off on helicopters, you dropped off a lot of\nyour support, and you got back to a very minimal capability by the time we had\nChallenger. Then we ramped back up. One of the key points we made over the\nrebuilding of the shuttle program is that this has to be a consistent thing over\ntime, some minimal capability. Right about now, we\'re already starting to cut\nback.\n\n120\n\nComment:\n\nRob F r o m\n\nI think I would disagree about having to have all of these sub-specialists on\ni\n\ninstantaneous call all the time.\nThat\'s just not necessary in terrestrial\nmedicine and I don\'t think that unnecessary. There may be certain individuals\nthat you may require for immediate consultation, but certainly not orthopedics.\nI would agree with you on that one and, perhaps, several of those other\nspecialties.\nComment: Alf red B o d\nWell, I can mention one precedent. There\'s a network for dealing with diving\naccidents in the country that works very well and their central operator is Duke\nUniversity and if someone has a diving accident and it involves a specific\nspecialty question involving diving medicine, they will phone out to someone vho\nis an expert in that area. This is a steady state process that\'s been going on\nfor ten years. It\'s a very successful program and it\'s all based on phone.\n\n._\n\n121\n\nb\nl\n.\n\nTEMPLE UNIVERSITY\nA Commonwealth University\n\n3401 N.

The presence of intravascular bubbles\nalthough not necessarily symptomatic raises several problems. First. we know that\nintravasc~~lar\nbubbles activate various hematologic systems and can cause illness i the\nn\nabsence of clear cut decompression sickness symptoms. Recent data presented in the\nUndersea and Hyperbaric Medical Society meeting of 1990 indicate that complement\nactivation will occur, and silent injury to brain and spinal cord may be found in some of\nthese cases. In addition, the evidence that ppatient foromen wale increases risk for\ndecompression sickness is of concern We would expect some individuals to develop chokes.\nif EVA becomes frequent, the incidence of limb bends would be intolerable mer +&e 3\nmonth confinement of the a ~ t r o ~ uin s Space Station.\nt the\nIt is therefore impeI-ative that we develop means to treat decompression\nsickness. A hyperbaric capability on Space Station Freedom is essential. The question is\nwhat type of hyperbaric capabilities should be available?\n\nThere is a long and continuing argument regarding monoplace vs.\nmultiplace chambers for treatment of decompression sickness. The advantages of a\nmultiplace chamber include the abUty to treat more than one individual who developed\ndecompression sickness at the same time. It is also important to provide hands on medical\nsupport for those with chokes, air embolism or CNS decompression sickness. Evaluation of\nthe individual while under pressure, support for the treatment of seizures and other serous\nmedical problems whfle under pressure i only possible in a multiplace chamber. The\ns\nmajor disadvantage of a multiplace chamber is cost and weight. Clearly, from a clinical\nstandpoint if\' cost and weight were not an issue. the choice would definitely be a multiplace\nenvironment because of the need to deal with anticipated serious type decompression\n124\n\n2.\n\nsickness that would potentially be lethal In a monoplace chamber where the attendants\ncould not reach the astronaut under treatment.\n\n._\n\nThe monoplace chamber principle advantage is in space and cost. From the\nstandpoint of medical support, this is an undesirable situation because once a patient is in\nthe chamber, he is they are inaccessible to medical support. Another important problem\nwith the monoplace chamber is that it must be compressed with loo016 oxygen to treat\ndecompression sickness. The standard protocols for therapy require 100% oxygen\nbreathing for up to six hours. I feel that a chamber containing looOm oxygen at 2.8 bar is a\ndefinite fire hazard in this environment. In the multiplace chamber the oxygen treatment\nis provided by a close circuit masskwlth an overboard dump so that no oxygen enrichment\nof the atmosphere occurs in any way. This eliminates risk of fire and is an important safety\nfeature of the multiplace chamber.\nIn addition, the technology of collapsible monoplace chambers is not\noptimal. These chambers are essential!y rigid ba!loons that are inflated by the pressure of\nthe environmental gas inside the chamber and are quite confining to the individual being\ntreated. As far as I know, these are not being used for treatment but are used on occasion for\nair or ground transport of a seriously injured diver who needs to be transported to a larger\nchamber for treatment. I am not aware of any collapsible monoplace chambers that are\nbeing used for definitive therapy. Unlike a rigid hull chamber, these are a somewhat\nunstable mechanical system for providing pressure therapy to an astronaut.\nIn summary. I feel that a collapsible monoplace chamber is an undesirable\napproach to treatment of decompression sickness in Space Station Freedom. It seriously\nimpairs the treatment o anything beyond a simple llmb bend. it raises the concern for fire\nf\nhazard in a 100% axygen environment. and is a serfously confining environment for an\nastronaut who m a y require up to six hours of treatment for serious decompression sickness\nor air embolism.\n\nI would strongly recommend that our initial evaluation and\nrecommendations be followed, that an airlock be outfltted as a hyperbaric chamber, that its\ntreatment capabilities be maintained as originally planned.\nI hope this infomation will be helpful.\n\nSincerely yours.\n\nAlfred A.

Before responding in writing to the issues that were presented\nto the participants during this seminar, I would like to thank you,\nJoe Boyce, Chuck Lloyd, and your staff for the arrangements made\non travel, accommodations, and meals.\nThe following represents a written compilation of my impressions\nand responses to the issues raised in the seminar. Please be aware\nthat in making these assumptions, certain baseline data were\nassumed, that being (1) that the space station would not be\ndesigned to perform major general surgery, (2) the health\nmaintenance facility would and could only provide 14 days of\ncritical care, (3) that an assured rescue vehicle would be present\nas an allowable safe haven and needed ambulance in the event of a\ncatastrophic injury or event, (4) that there is no current\nexpendable rocket which could deploy an air ambulance rescue from\nearth to the space station as a means of transporting a critically\ninjured patient and (5) that my responses are from the perspective\nof a critical care and transport specialist.\nA.\n\nHMF Capabilities\n\nIt would appear that in a remote environment the requirements\nlisted for the crew healthcare system or space station (JSC 31013REV. B and JSC 2 4 0 6 5 March 1990) would meet and probably exceed m y\nexpectations.\nIt is important to point out that with the\navailability of an assured crew rescue vehicle, required length of\ncritical care could be reduced from 14 days to 2 to 4 days. The\ngreatest limiting factor I see in caring for a critically ill\npatient in the space station is not equipment but rather the\nability to provide the 24-hour nursing critical care for 14-days.\nAlthough the telemedicine monitoring and the use of other crew\nmembers could greatly assist the medical crew officer in caring for\nsuch a patient it is doubtful that inexperienced non-medical crew\nmembers could provide efficient nursing. It would be my prediction\nthat attempts to care for a seriously ill patient while still\nperforming other crew duties, would "burn outatthe space station\ncrew within 3 to 7 days.\n\n12 9\n\nAn Intermountain Health Care Facility\n\nI\n\nRoger Billica\nAugust 30, 1990\nPage 2\n\nTherefore, I conclude that there will be a need to evacuate a\nseriously ill patient within that period of time.\nB.\n\nAn M.D. versus Non-M.D.\n\nChief Medical Officer\n\nIn response to the need for an MD versus a non-MD as a Chief\nMedical Officer on the Space Station "Freedom", it is my impression\nthat although a physician may be ideal, the requirement is not\nabsolutely mandatory. It is my feeling thzt whoever serves as a\nChief Medical Officer be trained to the equivalency of a Certified\nEmergency Medical Technician, that this individual has background\nand emerience in emergency and critical care, the individual is\ncurrent in Advanced Cardiac Life Support, Advanced Trauma Life\nSupport, and American Burn Life Support.\nIn addition, the\nindividual should be familiar with non-acute care disorder in order\nto reduce excessive reliance on telemedicine.\nThe use of either EM", Paramedic, RN, or MD, all have certain\nadvantages and disadvantages which should be considered in\nselecting a Chief Medical Officer.\nClearly, the training and\nexperience are the key factors which will enable the Chief Medical\nOfficer to properly perform their duties.\nIt would be expected\nthat an EMT, Paramedic or Nurse with recent training and experience\nin emergency care would be preferable to a physician lacking such\nexperience. On the other hand, a physician who has training in\nemergency and critical care provides the added benefit of\ndiagnostic acumen not present with the other types of medical\nspecialists (i.e., EMT, EM, RN).\nWhether or not the physician\'s ability to examine a crew member in\nthe space environment is more sensitive and specific than other\ntypes of medically trained people is not known.\nBecause of the\navailability of telemedicine, specialists from earth could be used\nto provide the diagnostic reasoning in the care of the patient in\nthe health maintenance facility and therefore reduce the reliance\nof a physician\'s diagnostic acumen. If a physician is selected, one\nwith surgical training would be preferable because of their\nenhanced technical skills.\nC.\n\nNecessary Medical Equipment\n\nIt was my feeling, following discussions at this seminar, that the\nplacement of a chest X-rav machine is not absolutely mandatory.\nIt was my impression that the consultants were unable to provide\nany example of where the use of X-ray would provide any information\nthat would result in any major therapeutic modality change.\nHowever, I wish to point out that although the X-ray\n130\n\n.\n\nv\n\nRoger Billica\nAugust 30, 1990\nPage 3\n\nmachine may not be necessary for SSF, development of X-ray will be\nneeded for the lunar and Mars missions. Generally, I see very\nlittle application of ultrasound particularly if it is technician\ndependent. Arguments have been made at this conference that the\nuse of telemedicine could assist in the technical application of\nthis device. Other more qualified expertise should be sought (ie.,\na diagnostic radiologist).\nThe use of Swan-Ganz catheterization is probably not necessary if\nthere is availability of an ARCV. However, with a requirement for\nprolonged critical care exceeding 4 days, there may be some\nperceived benefits with availability of the catheter. Clearly, the\nuse of Swan Ganz Catheter necessitates crew member training in\ncentral line placement and passing such a device.\nIrrespective of the selection of equipment, it is clear that\neauipment utilized in the critical care environment of the HMF must\nbe compatible with usaue in an ACRV transPort of a critically ill\npatient.\nTherefore, when developing the ACRV, designers must\ninclude appropriate adaptation of equipment into the assured rescue\nvehicle.\nFinally, the most significant and IIabsolutely mandatory1@equipment\nrequired in the space station and subsequent Lunar and Mars\nMissions is the availabilitv of telemedicine. This equipment will\nnot only augment the delivery of healthcare but could conceivably\nreduce workloads by assisting remotely in the care of a critically\nill patient. The ability to have a "think tank1*of medical experts\nwho would advise the CMO (irrespective of their level of medical\ntraining) is an important contribution to their care of the crew\nmembers.\n\nD.\n\nLaboratory Equipment\n\nRegarding laboratory capabilities, it was agreed that clinical\nchemistries, microscopic imaging, urinalysis, and hematology are\nnecessary laboratory components which must be included in the space\nstation.\nIt was not felt that coagulation parameters was an\nabsolute necessity. Furthermore, it is doubtful that with an End\nTidal C02 Analyzer in conjunction with pulse oximetry and measured\nserum HCOJ levels that the addition of Blood Gas Laboratory would\noffer few, if any, additional benefits.\nHowever, I do wish to\npoint out that in very low perfusion, the pulse oximetry is not\nalways reliable and blood gas analysis may be required in order to\nreliably determine POzIs.\n\nRoger Billica\nAugust 30, 1990\nPage 4\n\nE.\n\nBlood Products\n\nIn light of the short period of time that crew members would have\nto remain on the space station in the event of a major illness or\ninjury, it is doubtful that the bringing of additional blood\nproducts to the space station is necessary. Rather, crew members\nshould be typed and cross-matched as to enable the likelihood of\na direct warm transfusion in the event of needed blood products.\nOnly additional IV transfusion tubing would be required.\nF.\n\nChronic Parenteral Nutrition\n\nBecause of the limited length of stay (<14 days) anticipated for\nseriously ill crew members, need for chronic Parenteral Nutrition\ndoes not appear to be mandatory. Rather, it would be advisable to\nprovide Enteral feeding either through the oral or nasal gastric\nroute.\nG.\n\nA\n\nDedicated Computer for Health Maintenance\n\nThe computer as a health maintenance provider would not appear to\nbe necessary in this setting.\nIt\'s use is limited during down\ntimes or when the computer was being used for other necessary\nrequirements. Arguments have been made as to it\'s use as a backup\nif telemedicine was not available by providing text books which\ncould provide medical information to the Chief Medical Officer in\nthe event that telemedicine was not readily available. I see this\napplication more for use on the lunar and Mar\'s mission than for\nSSF.\n\nH.\n\nCriteria for ACRV Launch\n\nFinally, with respect to the question that was directly asked of\nme, "What criteria would you suggest for determining the need for\ntransport from SSF to ground?" My response is similar to that\nrecorded during the meeting, that being, "Any condition in which\nan excessive delay in transport would result in a loss of life or\nsevere and permanent disability.\'\'\nAs I pointed out, the factors\nwhich should be considered in initiatinu an emeruency medical ARCV\n(1) Tvr,e and severity of illness o r ini urn,\ntransDort would be:\n(2) Needed level of care.

The time dependence of\nthe disorder would be considered as requiring an "urgent transport1\'\nwhen the medical condition was such that time was crucial to\noutcome (eg. uncontrolled internal bleeding). The transport would\nbe considered as an "immediate transport" if the medical condition\nwas such that a short delay would not affect outcome but a long\ndelay might cause harm (eg. burn patient). Finally, the transport\nwould be considered an llelective transport1\' if the medicai\ncondition was such that time was not a factor in outcome (i.e.,\nfractured extremity). (4) The availabilitv of telemedicine. If,\nduring an accident, this was knocked out and the availability of\nconsultants and medical expertise was lost, then the need for ACRV\nwould be greater. (5) Shuttle Launch Availabilitv. If the shuttle\nwas to be launched in the window that was rather short, it is very\npossible that an ACRV transport may be unnecessary.\nHowever,\nshould that window be rather extended and the patient\'s condition\nrequires treatment prior to a shuttle launch, then ACRV transport\ncould be considered appropriate. (6) Safetv frisk versus benefit)\nof performinu the transport.\nClearly, an assured crew rescue\nvehicle will expose a patient to higher G-loads than might occur\nwith a shuttle. Based upon the patient\'s illness and injury and\nthe time of dependence for transport, the selection of ACRV as the\nmode of medical transport could be modified by factors such as\nshuttle availability. (7) Choice of using an ACRV would be limited\nalso to the cost-effectiveness of doing such a transport. Under\nthe circumstance, illness and injury severity would be measured\nagainst the advantages of doing an ACRV transport, remaining on the\nSpace Station, or utilizing the shuttle for a transport.\nI hope this written follow-up has provided you with a summary\nemphasis of issues discussed during this recent clinical specialist\nseminar.\nAgain, my thanks for inviting me to this important\nseminar.

M S F905\nHouston. Texas 77030\n\nDear Dr. Billica:\n\nI want to congratulate you on a successful clinical consultants seminar.\nIt is always a difficult undertaking to sequester s. large nuxtber of\nphysicians and other clinical specialists and obtain useful information.\nYou should be commended for a program that was not only productive, but\nwas quite enjoyable for the participants.\n\nI also want to take this opportunity to review some of the questions\nposed during the seminar from an Intensivist/Emergency Medicine/\nTransport Medicine standpoint.\na.\n\nDoes the HMF current Dlan Drovide the callabilities needed (in Your\nsDecialtv aiven a remote environment1 and could Y O U Dractice Your\nspecialtv with this facility? The hallmark of Critical Care\nMedicine is the application of titrated care based on the feedback\nof physiologic variables. The feedback o f physiological variables\nis commonly called patient monitoring and exists at many levels\nfrom the rudimentary physical assessment o f the patient with daily\ninput and output to invasive intervascular monitoring with\ncontinuous on line mixed venous oxygen end tidal C02\ndeterminations, etc. ICU patient monitoring is technology intensive\nand to a lesser degree personnel intensive.\nThe characteristic\ntitrated therapy of the ICU environment is physiologic support:\nSupport of vent i 1 at i on, oxygenation, cardi ovascul ar support wi t h\nvasodilators and mechanical devices, and support o f homeostasis in\nother physiologic systems. Physiologic support tends to be both\ntechnology and personnel intensive. Anyone who has practiced in a\nMedical or Surgical Intensive Care Unit knows that these entities\nare misnamed. They are not medically or surgically intensive, but\nrather, nursing intensive and therein lies the difficulty with the\npractice of intensive care in the HMF.\nIn general, from a patient monitoring standpoint, the HMF is\nwell equipped as currently envisioned and should be acceptable for\na 10-14 day monitoring period. From a physiologic support\nstandpoint, I feel strongly that SSF resources are inadequate for\n14 days of high level support. Although there are some hardware\nlimitations for a 14 day period (most notably a lack of specific\ndialysis or hemo-filtration capabilities), I see the major\nlimitation being personnel.\n134\n\nRoger Billica, M.D.\nPage 2\nSeptember 14, 1990\n\nCritically injured or i l l patient, may require one-on-one nursing\ncare provided by an experienced intensive care nurse in a 1-g\nenvironment. This earth bound unit has the support of respiratory\ntherapy, housekeeping and numerous other support services. It is\nunreasonable to expect a geologists CMO with six months of training\nacting as respiratory therapist, housekeeper, pharmacist, nurse,\nand physician in a micro-g environment to be as efficient as his\nground base counterpart. Even giving the CMO the benefit of the\ndoubt, assuming eight hour duty periods for patient care, and\nassuming that other crew members will likewise be able to provide\npatient care for an eight hour duty period, a four person crew\nwould be entirely consumed caring for a single injured or i l l crew\nmember.\n\n._\n\nOf course, this is a worst case scenario,but it must be recognized\nthat HMF will not be capable of prolonged multisystem physiologic\nsupport. A1 ternat i ve strategies for the potent i a1 1 y sal vageabl e\npatient must be entertained. Short periods (24-48 hours) of\nmultiorgan system support should be possible and clearly, 14 days\nof less intensive care are quite feasible. Two options present\nt hemsel ves :\n1. A recognition that a subset of patients that may have been\nsalvageable in a earth based care delivery system, will be lost; or\n2.A recognition that an ACRV for evacuation of critical i l l\npatients will be required.\nA decision regarding these two alternatives is clearly\noperational issue and not truly a medical decision.\nb.\n\nan\n\nCould YOU function without standard radioqraDhic imaainq (x-rav).\nRadiographic imaging is a useful adjunct in the care of the acutely\ni l l or injured patient but it is seldom that a clinical decision is\nbased solely on a radiographic finding. Clearly physiologic\nsupport can be maintained without radiographic capabilities. From\nan Emergency Medicine standpoint, I find that I frequently practice\nlegal medicine,rather than clinical medicine when obtaining\nradiographs. With the clinical capabilities that will be available\non HMF, I see no absolute requirement for radiographic\ncapabilities. Considerable discussion was generated regarding the\nutility ultrasonagraphy. It is my personal opinion that this\ncapability would be more valuable than radiographic imaging.\n\n135\n\nRoger Billica, M.D.\nPage 3\nSeptember 14, 1990\n\nC.\n\nMedical Certification of F1 iaht Hardware.\nThe Aeromedical\nTransport community has dealt with hardware problems in the\ntransport environment for a number of years. Clearly each and\nevery piece of medically related equipment should be subjected to\nsimulation studies including operation during the anticipated\nacceleration profiles (include micro-9). Testing and simulator\nusage in transport environments will be highly useful.\n\nd.\n\nHow would YOU amroach establishment of a traininq Droaram for crew\nmedical officers2 The emphasis for any training program for crew\nmedical officers must be clinical. A core of didactic information\nwill be necessary for proper functioning in the clinical\nenvironment but the majority o f the training should focus on\nacquiring clinical skills and judgement. The training program\nshould consist of Basic and Advanced Cardiac Life Support, and\nBasic and Advanced Trauma Life Support. Crew medical officers\nshould receive meaningful experience in an Emergency Room\nsetting and some experience in a clinical environment where\ncontinuity of care is provided. Above all, training should involve\nthe equipment to be used on HMF.\n\ne.\n\n-facilities\nWhat\n\nshould be provided in a transDort (ACRV) medical\n\nkit? Should an ACRV be included in the final program of the\nSSF. the life support capabilities present in HMF should function\n.\nin the ACRV. Specifically, mechanical ventilation and the\ncontinuous infusion of intravenous medications must be possible\nthrough the re-entry profile and a mechanism for securing specific\nmedications or instrumentation as dictated by the patient\xe2\x80\x99s illness\nmust be possible. A general purpose medical kit (vis a vis the\ncurrent Shuttle kit) should be provided. Evacuation of all\npersonnel should be possible and patient positioning in the most\nfavorable axis should be possible.\n\nf.\n\nHow would YOU Droceed with the establishment of clinical consultant\naround network? It was discussed during conference, I feel that\nthe clinical consultant network should consist of individuals with\na strong commitment to the SSF program. I believe it would be an\nerror to assign consultants duties to a specific institution as\nconsiderable familiarization with HMF capabilities will be\nnecessary for a meaningful consultation. Those individuals not\nhighly motivated will be less than ideal consultants. I feel\nthere would some advantage to the participation of the clinical\nconsultants network in the training of the CMO crew members as this\nwould permit precise knowledge of the cl inical capabil ities of each\nCMO and the development of some rapport between the clinical\nconsultant and the CMO. The clinical consultant network should be\nvery quickly available via telephone to the NASA Flight Surgeon and\nideally would have access to telemedicine downlink within a\nreasonable period of time. This may limit the clinical consultants\nto specific geographic regions around NASA facilities.\n13 6\n\nRoger Billica.

I am\ncontinuing t o c o l l e c t a r t i c l e s on this subject and i n m conference\ny\nreport I elaborated further. I have called Dr. Young and discussed\nplacing a HEPA ( H i g h e f f i c i e n t particulate a i r ) f i l t e r on the laminar\nflow device to decrease the p a r t i c l e count. I t h i n k t h a t this could be\nan important addition t o his device. Not only could w then prevent\ne\ncabin atmospheric contamination, b u t w could provide a regional operating\ne\natmosphere t h a t would decrease the risk of wound infection. Dr. Young\nf e l t that a HEPA f i l t e r modification would be simple t o add.\nI want you t o seriously consider coming to Clifton (as Dr. B i l l i c a ,\n- i n an o f f i c i a l NASA capacity) and a s s i s t me i n surgery on several\nnot\noccasions. Not only would i t get you back i n a clinical situation and\nyou could earn some money (about $200.00 f o r each one hour case), b u t\nmore importantly, w could get better oriented f o r the KC-135 f l i g h t s as\ne\na surgeon/assistant surgeon team. I f w do t h a t , I see no problem w i t h\ne\nusing some of the simple accessory equipment t h a t w will be u s i n g\ne\n(Vidrapes, magnetic instrument tray, or whatever). You would, of course,\nneed t o get your Texas medical license. From m standpoint you do not\ny\nneed malpractice insurance i f you are going t o a s s i s t only. The risk\nyou would take would be very low as i t is extremely unusual ( I have\nnever heard of i t ) t o involve the a s s i s t a n t i n any malpractice s u i t\nand this i s an unusually low malpractice area.

Billica, M.D.\nKRUG Life Sciences\n1290 Hercules Drive, Suite 120\nHouston, Texas 77058\nDear Dr. Billica:\n\n.\n\nI was unhappy to hear of the recent volume and weight reduction\nrestrictions imposed on the Health Maintenance Facility. If this does\noccur, it will lead to the inability to perform the medical mission as\nit is now defined, specifically, it will have the following consequences:\n1.\n\n2.\n\n.\n\nt\n\n.\na\n\nWe will be unable to adequately maintain the health of the crew\nand this will lead to degradation of mission performance and an\nincreased incidence of unneccessary medical evacuation due to\nthe lack of confidence in diagnosis or an inability to treat\nrelatively minor medical-surgical events that could otherwise\nbe treated onboard the station.\n\n3.\n\n4\n\nWith the decreased diagnostic and therapeutic capabilities we\nwill be unable to adequately care for a critically injured crew\nmember. We will therefore have to accept an increase risk of\nmortality.\n\nWith the lack of diagnostic capability,the importance of having\na more clinically competant Crew Medical Officer becomes extremely\nimportant. I strongly believe that this needs to be a M. D. with\nclinical experience and more intensive preflight clinical training\nthan is now being planned.\n\n4. The need for an-Assured Crew Returned Vehicle becomes .critically\nimportant as we will need to rely on medical evacuation more\noften due to the lack o f diagnostic ability and therapeutic\ncapability. Reliance on the Assured Crew Returned Vehicle will\nbe mandatory with events that involve critically injured crew\nmembers, situations that would exceed the clinical capabilities\nof the crew medical officer (especially in the area of surgery),\nand situations where we are unable to distinguish minor problems\nfrom major problems due to the lack of diagnostic capability.\nHopefully, the inadequancies of a drastically reduced Health Maintenance\nFacility will be realized with the passage of time in some of the more\ncritical capabilities.\n151\n\nSincerely ,\n\npt&&R- W\n\nh\n\nMark R .

Abstract\n\nThese are the proceedings of the Space Station Freedom Health Maintenance Facility 1990\nClinical Experts Seminar held August 27-29, 1990, at the Nassau Bay Hilton, Houston,\nTexas. Contained within are the agenda, list of medical consultants, executive summary,\nindividual presentations, and the comments generated from the working groups. Issues\ninclude the adequacy of current Health Maintenance Facility for Space Station Freedom;\nimpact of having, or not having, an ACRV or physician on board Space Station Freedom; new\nand developing technologies, techniques, and medications and their impact on the evolving\nSpace Station Freedom, considerations surrounding x-ray, ultrasound, lab,\ndecontamination, blood transfusion, nutrition, safe-haven, computer/telemedicine;\nsuggestions as to how to train the Crew Medical Officer; and, how the consultant network\nwill interface over the next several years.\n\n17.
