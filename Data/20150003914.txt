b'Norwegian Mapping Authority (NMA)\n\nNMA Associate Analysis Center\n\nNMA Analysis Center\nHalfdan Pascal Kierulf, Per Helge Andersen\nAbstract\nThe Norwegian Mapping Authority (NMA) has during the last few years had a close cooperation\nwith Norwegian Defence Research Establishment (FFI) in the analysis of space geodetic data using\nthe GEOSAT software. In 2012 NMA has taken over the full responsibility for the GEOSAT software.\nThis implies that FFI stopped being an IVS Associate Analysis Center in 2012. NMA has been an\nIVS Associate Analysis Center since 28 October 2010. NMA\xe2\x80\x99s contributions to the IVS as an Analysis\nCenters focus primarily on routine production of session-by-session unconstrained and consistent normal\nequations by GEOSAT as input to the IVS combined solution. After the recent improvements, we\nexpect that VLBI results produced with GEOSAT will be consistent with results from the other VLBI\nAnalysis Centers to a satisfactory level.\n\n1. Introduction\nA number of co-located geodetic stations with more than one observation technique have been\nestablished. In principle, all instruments at a given co-located station move with the same velocity,\nand it should be possible to determine one set of coordinates and velocities for each co-located\nstation. In addition, a constant eccentricity vector from the reference point of the co-located station\nto each of the individual phase centers of the co-located instruments is estimated using constraints\nin accordance with a priori information given by the ground surveys. One set of Earth orientation\nparameters (EOP) and geocenter coordinates can be estimated from all involved data types. The\npresent dominating error source of VLBI is the water content of the atmosphere, which must be\nestimated. The introduction of GPS data with a common VLBI and GPS parameterization of\nthe zenith wet delay and atmospheric gradients will strengthen the solution for the atmospheric\nparameters. The inclusion of SLR data, which is nearly independent of water vapor, gives new\ninformation which will help in the de-correlation of atmospheric and other solve-for parameters\nand will lead to more accurate parameter estimates. These, and many more advantages with the\ncombination of independent and complementary space geodetic data at the observation level, are\nfully provided by the GEOSAT software developed by FFI [1, 2]. GEOSAT is also useful for single\ntechnique analysis. The VLBI module of GEOSAT is now further developed by the NMA [5]. The\ngoals are both to act as an IVS Analysis Center delivering session-by-session unconstrained and\nconsistent normal equations to the IVS Combination Center and to provide quality control for the\ndi\xef\xac\x80erent modules used in GEOSAT.\n\n2. The GEOSAT Software and Analysis Activities in 2012\nThe NMA has during 2012 continued the work of making the VLBI module of the GEOSAT\nsoftware compatible with other VLBI analysis software that delivers results to IVS. In addition,\nthere is a lot of activity going on at NMA to further develop the multi-technique software GEOSAT\n(see the FFI TDC 2011 annual report).\nOne of the \xef\xac\x81rst challenges that had to be solved was how to extract an unconstrained SINEX\nsolution from the Upper-Diagonal UD Kalman \xef\xac\x81lter solution produced by GEOSAT. A \xef\xac\x81rst test\nsolution was sent to the IVS Combination Center in autumn 2009. During 2010 several solutions\nIVS 2012 Annual Report\n\n291\n\nNMA Associate Analysis Center\n\nNorwegian Mapping Authority (NMA)\n\ncovering all VLBI sessions with at least four stations from the start of 1994 to the end of 2009\nwere submitted to the IVS Combination Center. The \xef\xac\x81rst solution was presented at the 6th IVS\nGeneral Meeting, in Hobart, Australia [5]. The overall agreement between the NMA-GEOSAT\nsolution and the solutions from the other ACs was satisfactory for this \xef\xac\x81rst comparison. However,\nsome discrepancies were found. There were some systematic di\xef\xac\x80erences in the nutation parameters,\nwhich in our latest comparisons seem to have vanished. A misinterpretation of the NGS-format\nled to systematic di\xef\xac\x80erences in UT1-UTC. Systematic di\xef\xac\x80erences in station heights have also\ndisappeared in the latest comparison mostly due to the use of the VMF1 [4] model instead of 3D\nray tracing. We also noticed more noise in the GEOSAT-derived EOP compared to results from\nthe other software packages. The largest \xe2\x80\x9cEOP-outliers\xe2\x80\x9d disappeared after some manual editing of\nthe observations. Some other \xe2\x80\x9cEOP-outliers\xe2\x80\x9d were removed after a manual introduction of clock\nbreaks in the analysis.\n\n3. Plans for 2013\nOur plan is to go through the VLBI data from the start of 1994 to the present and to perform a\ndetailed manual editing of outliers. We expect that this will contribute to a reduction of the EOP\n\xe2\x80\x9cnoise level\xe2\x80\x9d. When the editing is completed, a new set of normal equations will be submitted\nto IVS for a test combination. We hope (and expect) that the results then will be at the level of\nthe other IVS ACs. As soon as the GEOSAT solution is in satisfactory agreement with the other\nsolutions, NMA will start to deliver unconstrained normal equations in the SINEX format to the\nIVS Combination Center on a routine basis.\nUnlike most of the other VLBI analysis software GEOSAT is based on a UD-Kalman\xef\xac\x81lter. This\nallows the stochastic behavior of the system to be changed. NMA will test di\xef\xac\x80erent stochastic\nparameters especially for the troposphere. Station and epoch dependent stochastic parameters\nbased on input from numerical weather models and IGS tropospheric products will be tested and\nevaluated. Tests of di\xef\xac\x80erent models are also planned \xe2\x80\x94 for instance, a comparison of results using\nVMF1 and 3D ray tracing.\nProducing VLBI solutions for IVS [3] is the \xef\xac\x81rst part of a larger strategic plan from NMA. The\nnext step is to include other geometric geodetic techniques (GNSS, SLR, and DORIS) in a common\nsolution where the di\xef\xac\x80erent techniques are combined at the observation level. The long-term goal\nof this large e\xef\xac\x80ort is to also include data from the gravity satellites GRACE and GOCE and from\naltimeter satellites.\n\n4.
