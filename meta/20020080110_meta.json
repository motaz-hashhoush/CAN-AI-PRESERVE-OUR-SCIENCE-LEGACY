The product can be applied safely in the presence of animals and humans, and was recently permitted for use on organic farms as livestock production aids. FlyCracker's carbohydrate technology kills fly larvae within 24 hours. By killing larvae before they reach the adult stages, FlyCracker eradicates another potential breeding population. Because the process is physical-not chemical-flies and other insects never develop resistance to the treatment, giving way to unlimited use of product, while still keeping the same powerful effect.", "title": "Pest Control on the \"Fly\"", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-07T12:52:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-27T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20020080110, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20020080110, "isbn": "0-16-067542-1", "id": "6977ce0e261a41b9b35db0729f17e02a", "publicationName": "Spinoff 2002", "publicationDate": "2002-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20020080110.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20020080110/downloads/20020080110.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20020080110/downloads/20020080110.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20020080110/downloads/20020080110.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
