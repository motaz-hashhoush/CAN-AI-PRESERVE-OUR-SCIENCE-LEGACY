b'NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Space Launch System: Affordability for Sustainability\nTodd A. May, Program Manager\nStephen D. Creech, Strategic Development Manager\nSpace Launch System Program\nNASA Marshall Space Flight Center, Alabama 35812\nU.S.A.\nSubmitted to the International Space University\nSustainability of Space Activities: International Issues and Potential Solutions\nFebruary 21\xe2\x80\x9323, 2012\nStrasbourg, France\nAbstract\nThe National Aeronautics and Space Administration\xe2\x80\x99s (NASA) Space Launch System (SLS)\nProgram, managed at the Marshall Space Flight Center, is charged with delivering a new\ncapability for human exploration beyond Earth orbit in an austere economic climate. But the SLS\nvalue is clear and codified in United States (U.S.) budget law. The SLS Program knows that\naffordability is the key to sustainability and will provide an overview of initiatives designed to fit\nwithin the funding guidelines by using existing engine assets and hardware now in testing to\nmeet a first launch by 2017 within the projected budget. It also has a long-range plan to keep the\nbudget flat, yet evolve the 70-tonne (t) initial lift capability to 130-t lift capability after the first\ntwo flights. To achieve the evolved configuration, advanced technologies must offer appropriate\nreturn on investment to be selected through the competitive process. For context, the SLS will be\nlarger than the Saturn V that took 12 men on 6 trips for a total of 11 days on the lunar surface\nsome 40 years ago. Astronauts train for long-duration voyages on platforms such as the\nInternational Space Station, but have not had transportation to go beyond Earth orbit in modern\ntimes, until now. To arrive at the launch vehicle concept, the SLS Program conducted internal\nengineering and business studies that have been externally validated by industry and reviewed by\nindependent assessment panels. In parallel with SLS concept studies, NASA is now refining its\nmission manifest, guided by U.S. space policy and the Global Exploration Roadmap, which\nreflects the mutual goals of a dozen member nations. This mission planning will converge with a\nflexible heavy-lift rocket that can carry international crews and the air, water, food, and\nequipment they need for extended trips to asteroids and Mars. In addition, the SLS capability\nwill accommodate very large science instruments and other payloads, using a series of modular\nfairings and adapters to configure the rocket for the mission. The SLS affordability plan includes\nstreamlining interfaces, applying risk-based insight into contracted work, centralizing systems\nengineering and integration, and nurturing a learning culture where the question \xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d is often\nasked and the answer \xe2\x80\x9cBecause we\xe2\x80\x99ve always done it that way\xe2\x80\x9d is rarely heard. The SLS\nProgram will deliver affordable space transportation solutions for the Orion Multi-Purpose Cargo\nVehicle\xe2\x80\x99s first autonomous certification flight in 2017, followed by a crewed flight in 2021. As\nthis briefing will show, the SLS will offer a global infrastructure asset for robotic and human\nscouts of all nations.\n\n'
