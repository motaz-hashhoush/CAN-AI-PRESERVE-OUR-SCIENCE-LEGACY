The significant growth in solid-lubricant technology has led NASA to look\nseriously at the potential for nonaerospace applications. Because\nmuch solid-lubricant data are generated by the government and, in\nsome cases, under proprietary restrictions, they are not always\nreadily available to the commercial lubrication engineer. In this\nsurvey, solid-lubricant information has been collected from all available sources, and is presented in a summary form that will help a\nbroad spectrum of readers to better understand the mechanism of\nlubrication by solid materials.\nThe survey is divid,ed into several chapters covering various\naspects of solid lubrication. Topics discussed include: a history of\nsolid lubrication, lubricating solids, bonded lubricants, new developments, methods of evaluation, environmental effects, application\nmethods, novel materials, and designs for the use of solid lubricants.\nExcerpts of solid lubricant specifications and a discussion of contact\nstresses imposed on specimens in three types of test machines used\nfor the evaluation of solid lubricants are found in the appendices.\nA profuse amount of literature is available on solid lubrication.\nNot all of the literature is easily accessible to the layman, however,\nparticularly that which has been generated by recent government\nsponsored research and development programs. The information\ncontained herein was gathered from solid-lubricant suppliers,\nNASA reports, personal contacts with NASA employees at various\nNASA centers, reports of and personal contacts with other U.S.\nGovernment agencies, and from the author\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge and experience in the field of solid lubrication.\nHISTORY OF SOLID LUBRICATION\n\nThe use of lubricants probably dates back to the invention of the\nwheel. Since this early beginning, lubrication and the production of\nlubricating media have grown to be one of the largest industries in\n1\n\n2\n\nSOLID LUBRICANTS\n\nthe world, yet from one-third to one-half of all the energy produced\nstill is lost through friction. Until the early 1800\xe2\x80\x99s, animal fats and\noils were the primary lubricant materials. Since the first oil well\nwas drilled in Titusville, Pa., in 1859, the technology of lubrication\nhas advanced rapidly. During the mid-1930\xe2\x80\x99s petroleum oils were\nimproved through the use of additives, which increased the loadcarrying ability, lubricity, corrosive protection, and thermal oxidative stability of oils.\nA trend also developed that required moving parts to operate at\nhigher and higher temperatures. Because petroleum oils could not\nadequately do the job at these high temperatures, synthetic lubricant materials were introduced. Temperatures now encountered in\nsupersonic aircraft, spacecraft, and certain industrial applications\nare beyond the useful range of even the synthetic lubricants. This\ntrend to the operation of bearing surfaces at higher temperatures\nand low pressures has led to the development and use of solid lubricants t o attain the necessary lubrication. Solid lubricants have at\nleast one very desirable feature-they do not evaporate under the\naforementioned conditions. Although the slippery feel and appearance of graphite and molybdenum disulfide have been known for\ncenturies, their use as solid lubricants dates back only about 25 years.\nGraphite is also known as black lead and plumbago. It was long\nconfused with similar appearing minerals, particularly molybdenite\n(MoS2),and was not classified as a separate mineral until 1556. In\n1779 it was proved to be carbon when it was oxidized to carbon\ndioxide.\nAbout 1564, the Borrowdale graphite mines in England began\nproducing graphite for pencils. These early pencils were made by\nencasing slabs of cut graphite in slotted wooden dowels. The name\ngraphite did not come into being until 1789, when Werner drew it\nfrom the Greek word graphein, which means t o write.\nThe ore molybdenite (MoS,) was known to the early Greeks. It has\noften been confused with graphite and with lead. The name is derived from the Greek word meaning lead.\nMolybdenum is widely distributed over the earth\xe2\x80\x99s crust in the\nform of molybdenite. The largest commercial source of the mineral\nis in Climax, Colo., wh,ere it is mined from granite containing the\nore in a finely divided state. Molybdenum disulfide has a metallic\nluster and is blue-grey to black in color. Early pioneers traveling\nthrough the Climax area used pulverized rock to lubricate the wheels\non their Conestoga wagons. This probably was one of the first uses\nof a molybdenum disulfide as a solid lubricant in this country.\nA solid lubricant can generally be defined as a material that provides lubrication to two relatively moving surfaces under essentially\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n3\n\ndry conditions. The most common of the present dry solid lubricants\nare graphite and molybdenum disulfide. lother materials that have\nbeen considered for use as solid lubricants, as well as coefficient of\nfriction data for those materials, am listed in tables I, 11, and 111.\nThe friction values given in the tables are higher than the values\noften quoted in the literature for solid lubricant films. This difference in values can be attributed to the fact that the reported values\nwere determined under light-load conditions (50 psi o r less), whereas\nvalues quoted for thin films are usually at higher loads (1000 psi or\nmore). An example of this can be seen in comparing the value of 0.34\nreported for MoS, with the values of 0.12 to 0.04 obtained on a thin\nMoS, film as load is increased from 1000 to 150 000 psi. For convenient testing, the materials listed in tablles I, 11, and I11 were\ncompacted into pellets; tests were then conducted to determine the\nrelative lubricative merits of the materials. Pelletizing of candidate\nlubricant materials has been widely used for obtaining comparative\nfriction information.\nAlthough the use of graphite as a lubricant probably began in\nthe middle ages, the use of bonded solid-lubricant materials discussed in this document is relatively new. The first U.S. patent for\nbonded materials (phosphoric acid bonded graphite film) was issued\nin the middle 1940\xe2\x80\x99s. (Patents covering bonded solid-film lubricants\nusually are issued covering both the lubricating solid and the binder\nmaterial-the medium by which the lubricating solid is attached to\nthe substrate.) Several hundred patents for solid-lubricating materials and binders have been issued so far.\nThe use of molybdenum disulfide as a lubricating solid also started\nin the 1940\xe2\x80\x99s and it is now used in more applications than any of the\nother lubricating solids. A large variety of binder materials was\nevaluated in the early bonded-film work, including materials such\nas corn syrup, asphalt-base varnish, silicone-base varnish, and\nglycerol (ref. 1).Binder materials now include thermoplastic and\nthermosetting resins, metals, ceramics, and metal salts. Soft metals,\nmetallic oxides, metallic sulfides, metallic selenides, metallic tellurides, and many others are currently being considered as solid\nlubricants by a large number of research groups.\nThe study of solid lubricants as now known is a relatively new\nfield. No systematic study of these materials was begun until long\nafter they were introduced in the aircraft industry. Solid lubricants\nsometimes were sold as \xe2\x80\x9ccure-all\xe2\x80\x9d materials, resulting in many misapplications. Unfortunately, the misapplications outweighed the\nproper applications, thereby slowing down the general acceptance of\nthese lubricants by industry. Designers still should not consider the\nuse of solid lubricants in many areas.\n\n4\n\nSOLID LUBRICANTS\n\nTABLE\nI.-Friction Data f o r Compounds Considered as Solid\nLubricants\nCoefficient of Friction\nMaterial\n\nLoad\ng\n326\n\nI\n\nLiF\nSi,N,\nSrS\nT1,S\nZnSe\nZrN\nAgI\nAg,S\nAg,Te\nAlPO,\nAlPO,\nAlPO,\nBi,S,\nBi,S,\nBi,S,\nBi,S,\nBi,O,\nBi2S3 Bi,O,\nCdSe\nCdS\nCdTe\ncos\ncu,s\nGeO,\nInSe\nMoSe,\nNiS\nPbSe\nPbS\nPbS\nPbS(1)\nPbS\nPbS-MoS,\nPbS-graphite\nSb,O,\nSbZS,\nSb,S,\nSb,Sj\nTiTe,\nTiTe,\nZnTe\nZrCl\nGraphite no. 2\nGraphite no. 1\n\n+\n+\n\nI\'\n\'I\nI\'\n\nI1\n\nI1\nI\'\n\n128\n"\nI\'\nI\'\nI\'\n\n326\n128\n326\nIL\n\n128\n6\n\'\n\n128\n<I\n\'I\n(I\n\n128\nI\'\n\n"\nII\n\nI(\nI\'\n(I\n(I\n\n326\n"\nId\n\n\'I\n\n128\nI\'\n\n"\n"\n\n128\nLI\nI\'\nII\n\n128\n\n\'(\n\n80" F\n0.30-0.35\n0.3-0.4\n0.3-0.9\n0.7-0.9\n0.25-0.5\n0.4-0.6\n0.2-0.3\n1.0\n0.36\n0.44\n1.33\n1.0\n0.60\n0.23-0.60\n0.56-0.58\n0.38\n\n-\n\n0.23-0.33\n0.58-1.0\n0.46\n0.50-1.15\n1.0\n0.48-0.58\n0.46-0.60\n0.20-0.33\n0.29-1.0\n0.40-0.67\n0.08\n0.30-0.68\n0.27-0.39\n0.47\n0.16-0.38\n0.20\n0.21-0.96\n0.38\n0.31-0.80\n0.50\n0.36-0.58\n0.48-0.58\n0.60-0.68\n0.45\n0.15\n0.15\n\n500" F\n\n0.9\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n1000" F\n0.8-0.9\n0.65-0.75\n0.9\n0.7-0.9\n-(melted)\n0.55-0.70\n0.55-0.75\n\n1.0\n\n1\n.o\n\n1.31\n1.0\n\n0.31-0.37\n0.80\n0.51\n0.18-0.3 8\n0.21-0.27\n0.20-0.32\n0.20\n0.31-0.37\n0.27-0.38\n0.55\n0.33-0.60\n0.58\n1.2\n0.60 (at750" F)\n\n-\n\n-\n\n0.21-0.77\n0.24-0.39\n0.49-0.62\n0.20\n0.42\n0.58\n0.84\n0.40\n0.72\n1.2\n0.41-0.60\n0.31-0.40\n0.25\n0.47\n\n-\n\n0.48\n0.27-0.47\n0.13\n0.29\n\n-\n\n0.21-0.49\n0.35-1.0\nl.O(at300"F)\n0.95\n0.86\n0.32-0.40\n0.48-0.96\n0.18-0.22\n0.10\n\n-\n\n-\n\n0.25\n0.21\n0.29\n0.20\n0.15-0.19\n0.37\n0.21\n\n-\n\n0.49\n0.77(at670\xc2\xb0F)\n0.38-0.48 (at 800" F)\n0.58\n0.27\n0.50-0.60\n0.13-0.23\n\n5\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nTABLE (Concluded)\nICoefficient of Friction\nLoad\n\nMaterial\n\n500"F\n\n1000"F\n\n0.14-0.30\n0.20-0.25\n\n0.06-0.12\n0.11\n\n0.20-0.27\n0.22-0.56\n\n- 0.55-0.70\n\ng\n\nGraphite\nMoS, +graphite\n(7%by weight)\nPbS(I1)\nMoS, +graphite\n(31% C byweight)\nMoS, + graphite\n(73% C by weight)\nMoS,\n\n80" F\n\n326\n128\n\n-\n\n128\n\n0.16-0.21\n\n0.3-0.7\n0.12-0.14\n\n0.13-0.16\n\n"\n\n0.15-0.21\n\n0.08-0.11\n\n0.11-0.17\n\n326\n\n0.34\n\n0.10\n\n-\n\nTest Conditions: Mark I11 Pellet Machine\nLoad: 326 g (avg approx 50 psi)\nSpeed: 600 ft/min\nTrack: polished, Rex AAA steel.\nTests were conducted at Midwest Research Institute (MRI).\n\nADVANTAGES A N D DISADVANTAGES\n\nO SOLID LUBRICANTS\nF\n\nSliney (ref. 2) and other investigators (refs. 3 through 10) suggest\na number of advantages and disadvantages of solid lubricants.\nBasically, the following are as summarized by Benzing (ref. 11).\nAdvantages\n\nDisadvantages\n\nGood stability at extreme temperatures and in chemically\nreactive environments\n\nCoefficient of friction generally\nhigher than with hydrodynamic lubrication\n\nAffords design advantages :\n(1)lighter weight, simplification, recirculating oil system with pump and heat\nexchangws is eliminated,\nand fewer seals are required\n(2) Improved dynamic mechanical stability ; bearings can be placed closer to\nheat sources allowing the\nuse of shorter rotating\nshafts, thereby alleviating\n\nSome wear unavoidable because\nof solid sliding contact\nFilm coatings have finite wearlives\nSolid lubricants have no cooling\ncapacity\n\n6\n\nSOLID LUBRICANTS\n\nTABLE\n11.-Results of Lubricity Tests on Thermally Stable Materials\nCoefficientof approximate friction\nRoom temperature\n\nBN\nCdC1,\nCrC1,\nPbF,\nMnC1,\nNiCl,\n\n450" F\n\n0.3\n\nMaterial\n\n0.15\n0.17\n\n0.6\n\n0.2-0.3\n0.6\n0.35\n0.45\n0.9-0.45\n0.95+\n0.95+\n1.15\n0.55\n\nSnS,\nSnO\nSnS\n\nTa,S,\nTi C\nTis,\n\n0.7\n\n0.7-1.6\n\nws,\n\n-\n\n0.6\n0.17\n0.19\n\n-\n\n0.63\n\n-\n\n0.6\n\n0.2\n\nTest Conditions: Mark 111 Pellet Machine\nLoad :326 g (avg approx 50 psi)\nSpeed: 600 ft/min\nTrack : polished, Rex AAA.\nTests were conducted at MRI.\n\nAdvantages\n\nDisadvantages\n\nproblems of shaft critical\nspeed\n\nI\n\nCan be used under high nuclear\nradiation conditions\nCan be used under extremely\nhigh-load conditions\nSolid lubricants are often used on components that are difficult to\nlubricate with conventional liquids and, in many cases, can provide\nlubrication for the life of the part. These lubricants can also be used\nto advantage in equipment where an accumulation of dust or dirt\ncannot be tolerated. Because certain solid lubricants are not impact\nsensitive in LOX,they have been used widely in this environment.\nAlthough solid lubricants will probably never replace the home\noil can, they will greatly extend the useful life of many devices the\nhomeowner does not remember to oil anyway.

The proper application of solid\nlubricants will permit the successful operation of machinery under\nconditions of very high temperature, cryogenics, very high vacuum,\nnuclear radiation, extreme loads, and chemically reactive environments.\nThe selection of a solid lubricant for a specific application is a\ncomplex lubrication-engineering task. However, a discussion of the\ntheory of lubrication with solid materials, such as molybdenum\ndisulfide, graphite, lubricating plastics, and others, is beyond the\nscope of this document. The information stressed in this survey is\npractical, being derived from the experience of a number of investigators and users.\nBecause of a lack of proper terminology, and also for proprietary\nreasons, lubricants will be described by trade names in this survey.\nIt has been impractical to include every product that is available,\nalthough no product was knowingly ignored. No effort was made to\nrate the lubricants according to any order of preference, and\nproducts named in a list or table will be presented in alphabetical\norder.\n\nCHAPTER 2\n\nBonded Solid Lubricants\nSolid lubrication can be accomplished in several modes-lubricating powders, bonded films, and lubricant composites (metal- and\nplastic-based). This chapter is limited to a discussion of bonded\nsolid lubricants, the most widely used mode. Bonded solid lubricants\nare distinguished from other solid lubricants in that they are\nattached to the substrate by means of a binder material-resin,\nsilicate, or ceramic. A sketch showing surfaces coated with a bonded\nsolid lubricant is shown in figure 1.\nRESIN-BONDED SOLID-FILM LUBRICANTS\n\nResin-bonded films are currently the most widely used solid lubricants, including both \xe2\x80\x9cair-cured and \xe2\x80\x9cheat-cured\xe2\x80\x9d binder materials\n(air-cured and heat-cured refer to the method used in polymerizing\nthe resin binder). The solid lubricant pigments used most frequently\nin resin-bonded films are : molybdenum disulfide (MoS,), tungsten\ndisulfide (WS,), polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), and graphite.\nThe pigment may consist of one lubricating solid or a mixture of\nseveral, the function of which is to reduce th,e wear and lower the\nfriction of the system being lubricated.\nThe binder holds the lubricating pigment to the metal surface\nso that the motion of parts does not bring about a complete loss of\nthe pigment from the system. In the formulation of resin-bonded\nsolid lubricants, the proper pigment-to-binder ratio is very important. The pigment-to-binder ratio, however, can vary widely with\nthe particular resin used.\nCertain factors can affect the overall performance of bonded films\nin any given situation. One is the condition of the metal surfaces\nbeing lubricated, which, in most cases, are generally changed or\nmodified by some pretreatment to obtain the best film performance.\nOther factors involve variables directly related to the application of\nthe film, such as spraying techniques. In addition to application factors, environmental conditions and the operating characteristics of\nthe system being lubricated can seriously affect the film quality.\nThese factors should be considered in the selection of a bonded solid\nlubricant for each application.\n9\n\n10\n\nSOLID LUBRICANTS\n\n..................................................\n..................................................\n\nL\n\nBONDED\nSOLID\nLUBRICANT\n\nFIGURE1.-Surfaces\n\ncoated\nwith bonded solid lubricant.\n\nI\n\nThe resin-bonded solid lubricants are generally applied in thin\nfilms to the surfaces of the components being lubricated. In most\ncases, the surfaces have been pretreated in a manner that will depend on the substrate being used and the service for which the parts\nare intended. Resin-bonded solid-lubricant films can be applied by\nspray, dip, or brush; spray is usually the most satisfactory. The\ncoating thickness should range from 0.0002 to 0.0008 in., the optimum being about 0.0005 in. A film that is too thick will be structurally weak and peel or flake off with a sliding motion under load ;\nif, on the other hand, the film is too thin, premature failure may result due to rupture.\nSeveral researchers (refs. 12 through 15) have determined optimum film thicknesses for resin-bonded films. Although some of the\nfindings are contradictory, it appears that for high load a thinner\nfilm (0.0003 in. per surface) will give the longest wear-life. For\nlighter load conditions the thickness can be substantially increased.\nHowever, economics of the coating process (such as spray time and\ncuring time) should enter into any decision involving the use of\nthicker films. A second area that must be considered if thick films are\nused is the generation of wear debris. Large amounts of wear debris\nare generated from thick films and some provision must be made for\nthe removal of this debris from thte bearing area. The removal of\nwear debris is discussed further in chapter 9.\nThe wear-behavior and wear-life characteristics of a resin-bonded\nsolid lubricant are different from those of most other solid film\nlubricants. In its initial wear-in, it will exhibit relatively high wear\nwhich will become less with time. The initial high wear rate can be\nattributed to the loss of loose material from the surface of the film\nand the compaction of the film by the applied load. As running\ncontinues, the film will appear glossy or burnished. The best performance, lowest wear, and steadiest friction are obtained during\nthis time.\n\nBONDED SOLID LUBRICANTS\n\n1\n1\n\nSeveral investigations have been conducted on the effects of\nvarious conditions believed to affect the performance of a film. The\nhardness of the metal substrate has been one of the areas investigated. Crump (ref. 16) determined the beneficial effects of hardness\non wear rate. Lavik (ref. 17) found little or no effect of hardness in\nthe case where test specimens were of the line-contact type, whereas\nwith the conforming-contact type he found a slight benefit with\nincreased substrate hardness. Gaddis (ref. 18) found a substantial\nincrease in wear-life with increased surface hardness on lightly\nloaded high-surface-speed tests. All of these programs were conducted on simulative bench testers in the laboratory. It was found\nthat in hardware applications the harder bearings offer more beneficial results (longer film life with lower wear rates) than those\nobtained on softer substrates.\nBonded dry-film lubricants can provide long wear-life, good abrasion resistance, good adhesion, and good resistance to a variety of\nsolvents. Performance of the films depends to a large extent on the\ncured properties of the binders used.\nAir-Cured Resin-Bonded Solid Lubricants\n\nAn air-cured, resin-bonded solid lubricant consists of a lubricating powder, or powders, in an air-curing resin-binder material.\nThe lubricating pigments most frequently used are molybdenum\ndisulfide, graphite, o r a lubricating plastic such as polytetrafluoroethylene. This type of solid film lubricant usually contains a lower\ntotal solid content than heat-cured film to provide a more satisfactory solution for aerosol application.\nBinder materials used in the air-drying solid lubricants are\nthermoplastic resins, such as cellulosics and acrylics. These resins\nrequire no heat cure and therefore can be used on substrates that\ncannot be baked. They produce a fairly hard film, but do not have\ngood solvent resistance. Examples of air-drying materials are :\nFel-Pro C-300\n\n. . . . . ..\n\nLubri-Bond A\nLubri-Bond 35C\n\n}. . .\n\nMolykote M88\nMolykote M8800\nMolykote 321\n\nt\n\nSurf-Kote A-1625\n\n.Fel-Pro Inc., Skokie, Ill.\n\n. .

The materials consist of the\nlubricating pigment and a specially formulated resin binder. The\nlubricating pigment is usually a mixture of approximately 90 percent molybdenum disulfide and 10 percent graphite, which seems to\ngive the best results when friction and wear are considered. The\nrelatively small concentration of graphite appears to improve the\nlow-load performance (lower friction) of the MoS,. Replacing\ngraphite with antimony trioxide (Sb20,) produces the same effect.\nFilms are available that contain small percentages of such elements\nas silver, indium and lead, as well as a mixture of MoS, and graphite, but the lubricant coatings containing only graphite and\nmolybdenum disulfide are more readily obtainable.\nThe frictional behavior of a material is an important consideration in its selection as a solid lubricant for resin-bonded films. Feng\n(ref. 19) indicates higher values of friction for a bonded film than\nfor the lubricating solid itself. This may no longer be the case, since\nthermosetting resin-binder materials have been improved to the\npoint where they do not appear to alter the friction values of the\nlubricating solids.\nCuring of the binders in these films will usually require a bake of\napproximately 1 h r a t 300\' t o 400\' F. Special films such as those\ncontaining polyimide binders require baking temperatures of\n575\' F for 2 hr. Because of the baking temperature, care in the\nselection of the metal substrate is required. For example, temperatures of about 275\' F for 1hr can weaken certain aluminum alloys.\nBinders that are normally used in the heat-cured solid lubricants\nare thermosetting and include alkyds, phenolics, epoxies, silicones,\nand polyimides. Alkyds are relatively inexpensive, cure at low temperatures (less than 500\xc2\xb0F), and are generally easy to handle.\nPhenolics have good surface adhesion and are harder than the\nalkyds, but require a high-temperature curing cycle, usually 300\' to\n400\' F for 1 hr. Epoxy resins have excellent solvent resistance and\nvery good adhesion, but are softer than phenolics. Modified epoxyphenolics combine the good properties of both materials. Silicones\noffer a higher operating temperature, but are softer and have only\nfair adhesion.\nThe polyimides are relatively new in the adhesive field. They were\noriginally intended as laminating resins for use with fiber glass\ncloth. They have also been used as a wire insulation in electric\nmotors where high temperature is a problem. The polyimide binder\nmaterials have extended the useful range of the resin-bonded lubri-\n\nBONDED SOLID LUBRICANTS\n\n13\n\ncant films up to approximately 700\'F. Films containing these\nmaterials have been evaluated a t temperatures up to 1000\xc2\xb0 F in\nvacuum (ref. 20). Such tests have demonstrated that the polyimide\nresins have a limited life at extreme temperatures. The polyimidebonded solid-lubricant films are superior in extremely high-load\napplications. The polyimide-bonded films will be discussed further\nin chapter 3.\nThere are several other new binder materials being considered\nfor use with solid lubricants. These materials are similar in structure to the polyimides and include the pyrrones, polybenzimidazoles\n(PBI) and polybenzothiazoles (PBT). Of these three materials, the\npyrrones are very resistant to oxygen and strong acids.\nThese heat-cured materials are superior to the air-drying materials and should be used where high load-carrying ability or long\nlife is required. They are usable over the temperature range of\n-100\' to f700\' F. Examples of the heat-cured materials are :\nDag. 253 . . . . . . . Acheson Colloids Co., Port Huron, Mich.\nDrilubeno. 1 . . . . .

Hohman Plating and Manufacturing, Inc.,\nDayton, 0.\nThe importance of the resin-bonded solid lubricants has grown\nrapidly in the last 20 years. Because of this rapid growth, a means\nof controlling the quality of the bonded films was needed. To ensure\nthat quality be maintained, government agencies have prepared\nspecifications covering the materials and their uses. Typical of these\nspecifications are MIL-G8937, MIL-L-23398, and MIL-L-46010.\nThere are also several custom variations available in these heatcured, solid-film lubricants.\nINORGANIC-BONDED SOLID-FILM LUBRICANTS\n\nInorganic-bonded lubricating pigments are usually referred to as\nhigh-temperature solid lubricants. These materials are intended for\nuse at temperatures from approximately 50OOF to in excess of\n\n* Polyimide-bonded material MLR-2, developed by MRI under a NASA\ncontract.\n\n14\n\nSOLID LUBRICANTS\n\n1200\' F. There is considerable overlap in applicable temperature\nranges for the various binder materials ; however, certain ones\noperate very satisfactorily a t temperatures down to -3OOO F. The\nhigh-temperature inorganic-bonded solid lubricants are a logical\nextension to the resin-bonded types. They employ ceramic or saltbased binders to give greater temperature resistance than resins\nand usually employ lubricating solids which are more thermally and\noxidatively stable than graphite or MoS,. These lubricants usually\ncontain lubricating solids (pigments) such as lead oxide, lead sulfide, calcium fluoride, gold, and silver. There are exceptions, however, and a number of the ceramic and salt-based binders are used\nwith MoS, and graphite.\nNonceramic Materials\n\nThe bonding technique for these materials commonly employs\nwater-soluble silicates and phosphates, which produce a hard coating that tends to be somewhat brittle when cured (curing is accomplished by slowly driving out the excess water by heating). In\ngeneral, they can be used at temperatures from -300\' to +lOOOo F.\nSolid lubricants containing the salt-based binders usually contain\ngraphite, MoS,, lead sulfide, or powdered metals.They can be used\nin extremely high-load areas, with loads in excess of 100 000 psi.\nFor applications where movement is a prime design consideration,\nhowever, they are not as good as resin-bonded films as f a r as\nwear-life and strength are concerned. Two advantages of these\nfilms over others are that (1) they will not outgas significantly in a\nvacuum of\ntorr and (2) they are compatible with liquid oxygen.\nDisadvantages include (1) lack of corrosion protection and (2) softening of the film in the presence of water or moisture for extended\nperiods of time. Examples of salt-based bonded films are :\n\n. Air Material Aeronautical Materials\nLaboratory, Philadelphia, Pa.\nDrilube 805 . . . . . . . Drilube Co., Glendale, Calif.\nMLF-5* . . . . . . . . .

Their principal advantage is their good strength at\nelevated temperatures. The lubricating solids commonly employed\nwith ceramic binders are graphite, calcium fluoride (CaF,), lead\noxide, and a mixture of barium fluoride (BaF,) and CaF,. Useful\ntemperature ranges are from approximately 500\' F to more than\n1500O F.\nAlthough the ceramic-bonded materials, as a class, do not perform as well (Le., have low friction and wear), as the resin-bonded\nmaterials a t lower (room) temperatures, they are generally better\nthan the resin-bonded films by a considerable amount (over 10\ntimes) a t higher temperatures (700O F). There are exceptions, however, one being when the lubricants are run at high speeds, resulting\nin high temperatures (over 700\xc2\xb0 F) being generated in the contact\nzone. In such case, the ceramic-bonded films will generally outperform the resin-bonded films. The North American Rockwell\nCorp. has shown that their Vitrolube material outperforms the\nresin-bonded lubricants at room temperature (at low speed as well\nas high speed).\nExamples of ceramic-bonded films are :\nElectrofilm 1000\nVitrolube*\nNASA CaF,\n\nElectrofilm Corp., North Hollywood, Calif.\nNorth American Rockwell Corp., Los Angeles,\nCalif.\nNASA-Lewis Research Center, Cleveland, 0.\n\nOne problem in the use of ceramic-bonded materials is the thermal\nexpansion of the cured coating. This must be matched closely with\nthe expansion of the base material. If the thermal expansion characteristics are not the same or very similar, the coating will fracture\nand separate from the substrate.\nPRETREATMENTS\n\nIt is standard practice t o pretreat surfaces prior to the application of bonded solid lubricants. Pretreatments such as phosphating\nor grit blasting can greatly affect the performance of bonded solid\nlubricants by tending to increase the surface area and thus give the\nlubricant binder more area on which to hold. Also, these pretreat-\n\n* Licensed and applied by National\n\nProcess Industries, Southgate, Calif.\n\n16\n\nSOLID LUBRICANTS\n\nments generally increase the wear-life of the lubricant film.\nWhether chemical or mechanical pretreatments are used will depend on the base metal being employed. Pretreatments are required\nin nearly all of the solid-lubricant specifications described in\nappendix A.\nPretreatments for various metal surfaces to improve the wearlife of resin-bonded solid lubricants are given below.\nType of metal\nSteel\n\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n\nPretreatment\n.Grit blasting or other mechanical process\n\n}\n\nPhosphating\n(except stainless steel)\nSulfiding\nAluminum . . . . . . . . . . .

Chemical etching or grit blasting\nThere are other pretreatments that give acceptable behavior in\nspecific applications, but the way in which these pretreatments improve the wear-life of a solid lubricant is not fully understood. The\ntheory stated earlier, that pretreatment increases the surface area,\nis acceptced by most workers in the field. Devine et a1 (ref. 21)suggest\nthat pretreatment causes the formation of small pits or reservoirs\nof the lubricant which feed lubricant to the wearing area during\nthe rubbing process. This theory is based on Devine\xe2\x80\x99s observations\nthat reservoirs machined in a metal surface also give improved\nperformance. Investigators at The Boeing Co. have done similar\nwork with shot-peened surfaces which held large amounts of solid\nlubricant, and agree with Devine.\nThe most common pretreatments are phosphating, anodizing,\nand grit blasting. These have had widespread use, particularly in\nthe aerospace industries where common bearing or wearing surfaces include steel, aluminum, and titanium. Phosphate coatings are\nused extensively with liquid lubricants to improve bearing life and\nto gain a small measure of protection from corrosion. They are also\nused under solid lubricants to gain some corrosion protection of the\n\nBONDED SOLID LUBRICANTS\n\n17\n\nsubstrate, since the solid lubricants do not provide such protection.\nLikewise, anodizing is preferred on aluminum parts for protection\nfrom corrosion.\nAlthough proper phosphate pretreatments are difficult, Stupp\n(ref. 22) developed a good phosphate coating. He noted the effects of\nbath temperature, immersion time, and bath acid strength on the\nthickness of the coating, as well as the structure and size of crystal\ngrowth. Stupp found that the best conditions were : bath temperature--205" F, bath acid-7 to 8 points (full acid), and treatment\ntime-approximately 15 min. The author is in complete agreement\nwith these findings because he has often observed faulty solidlubricant coatings resulting from an improperly controlled phosphate bath. An important consideration in phosphate treatments is\nthe temperature to which the part will be subjected in use. Gaddis\n(ref. 23) Campbell (ref. 24), and Lavik (ref. 25) have demonstrated\nthat phosphate coatings should not be used at over 600" F.\nThe chemical pretreatments discussed above are used primarily in\nconjunction with the resin-bonded solid lubricants that have curing\ntemperatures below 400" F. These same pretreatments can be used\nwith the inorganic and nonceramic-bonded lubricants if the curing\ntemperatures can be held below 400" F. The most accepted surface\npretreatments for the inorganic-bonded films are wet- or dry-grit\nblasting. Pretreatment of surfaces for ceramic-bonded solid lubricants is in nearly all cases grit blasting. Sliney (ref. 26) has shown\nthat a period of oxidation at 2000" F improves the bonding of\nceramic-based solid lubricants on Ren6 41 high-temperature alloy.\nAPPLICATION PROCESSES\n\nThe processes by which bonded solid lubricants are applied to\nbearing surfaces can have considerable effect on film behavior and\nperformance. As a part of this survey, all modes of applicationspraying, dipping, or brushing-of the various bonded films (resin,\ninorganic, nonceramic, and ceramic) will be discussed.\nOf the three common methods of application, spraying and dipping are most often used. There are cases, however, where brushing\ncan be used to advantage. The commonly held opinion that spraying\na dry lubricant is just like spraying paint is not correct. The application of a solid lubricant in such a manner will result in a poor film.\nIn a dipping process, the entire part is usually completely immersed\nin a lubricant bath, but this process will sometimes produce a film\nof nonuniform thickness. Generally speaking, a dry solid lubricant\nis a very special material and should be treated as such.\nTable IV contains information on general processes for applying\n\n18\n\nSOLID LUBRICANTS\n\n19\n\nBONDED SOLID LUBRICANTS\n\nresin-bonded solid lubricants to various metal surfaces. Similar\nprocesses are outlined in Appendix A. Most manufacturers of\nbonded solid lubricants recommend certain methods of application\nfor their particular films. Although these methods may be similar\nfor various films, time and temperature for curing of the films will\nvary because of the different materials used in the preparation of\nthe solid-lubricant formulations.\nAccurate control of the many process variables is important.\nControl of such items as phosphating baths is essential, and the\nproper consistency of material to be sprayed must be maintained by\nthe addition of proper thinners to the lubricant mixture prior to\napplication. Curing temperatures also are important. I n addition\nto controls a t a given level, it is essential that the curing temperature not be so high as to affect the properties of the substrate material. Table V contains suggested maximum curing temperatures\n\nTABLE\nV.-Suggested\n\nCuring Schedules for Resin-Bonded Solid\nLubricants\nCuring schedule\n\nSubstrate material\nSteel and alloys\nSteel and alloys, case hardened\nStainless steel (except 440)\n440 stainless steel\nAluminum and magnesium alloys\nAluminum and magnesium alloys\nBronzes\nNickel and nickel alloys\nTitanium\nMonel and Inconel\nPlated surfaces (chrome or nickel plated)\n\nTemperature, F\n\nTime, min\n\n400\n300\n400\n300\n\n60\n60\n60\n60\n\n275\n\n60\n\n300\n300\n400\n400\n400\n400\n\n25\n\n60\n60\n60\n60\n60\n\nand times for resin-bonded solid lubricants on several materials.\nAn undercured film will have poor adhesion and fluid resistance,\nwhile the coating cured too long at an extremely high temperature\nwill probably have a reduced wear-life because the binder will suffer\noxidation, thereby destroying the adhesion to the substrate material.\nFilms containing high-temperature polymeric binders of the\npoly imide type usually require much higher curing temperatures\nthan those listed in table V . Curing temperatures for these materials can be as high as 575O F for 2 hr. Consequently, their use is\nlimited to substrate materials that will not be weakened by the\n\n20\n\nSOLID LUBRICANTS\n\nhigh-temperature cure. Curing of the inorganic-bonded films (such\nas silicate and phosphate) is accomplished in the temperature range\nof 3 0 to 400\' F over extended periods of time, up t o 16 hr. Certain\n0\'\nof the ceramic-bonded films will require curing temperatures t o\n2000O F.\nThe equipment used in the application of bonded solid lubricants\nranges from simple to very complex. The application process used\nwill depend on the quantity and size of parts to be coated.\n\nCHAPTER 3\n\nNew Developments\nThe development of bonded solid lubricants has not always kept\npace with the ever-changing requirements of industry. This has\nbeen particularly true in the aerospace industry where there is a\nneed for lubricants that are usable over a wide variety of conditions.\nThese conditions include : low and high temperatures, operation in\nvacuum for extended periods of time, and compatibility with\noxidizers.\nMany government agencies, including the Army, Navy, Air Force,\nFederal Aviation Administration (FAA) and NASA, are sponsoring research both in-house and under contract that is directed\ntoward the development of new solid lubricants and techniques of\nlubrication. Most large aerospace companies also sponsor in-house\nprograms on lubrication. This research has resulted in many significant contributions, and some new solid lubricants are now\ndeveloped to the point where they are commercially available. Not\nall of the new developments can be covered in a publication of this\nnature, but this chapter will be devoted to a discussion of several of\nthe newest materials.\nMLF- AND MLR-BONDED FILMS\n\nMidwest Research Institute has been conducting a program for\nNASA to develop, investigate, and evaluate solid-lubricant films\nsuitable for use in both normal atmosphere and space environments. As a result of these programs, the bonded solid-lubricant\nfilms listed in table VI were developed.\nThe amount of development and testing already conducted on the\nMLF films (table VI) is so voluminous that it is impossible to report\nit in its entirety here. The complete history of these materials,\nhowever, can be found in references 27 through 32.\nIn the MLR series of solid lubricants, the MLR-1 and MLR-2\nformulations use polyimide resin binders. These resins are stable at\ntemperatures to 1000\' F in air and over 1300\' F in vacuum or in an\ninert atmosphere (ref. 20). The use of polyimide resin has increased\nthe usable temperature range of resin-bonded solid lubricants from\n450" F to over 700\' F. In fact, when formulated with MoS, pigment\n21\n\n22\n\nSOLID LUBRICANTS\n\nand used at elevated ,temperatures, it is possible to lose all of the\nsolid lubricant pigment by oxidation and still have the binder material intact. The MLR-1 and MLR-2 lubricants are capable of\ncarrying high loads for extended periods of time and also have low\nfriction and long wear-life. Because the polyimide-resin binders\nrequire a high-temperature cure ( 5 7 5 O F for 1 hr), they cannot be\nused on aluminum alloys or other metals that might be altered by\nthe curing temperatures. The polyimide materials have been extensively investigated and are well documented in references 27\nthrough 32.\nThe MLR-20 and MLR-21 materials listed in table VI are similar\nto the MLR-1 and MLR-2 materials in that they contain high-\n\nTABLE\nVI.-Solid-Lubricant Film Compositions and Specifications\nFilm\ndesignation\n\nLubricant-tobinder ratio\n\nMLF-5\n\n10:1:5/7\n\nMLF-6\n\n10:1:3/7\n\nMLF-7\n\n10:1:5/5\n\nMLF-8\n\n10:1:5/8\n\nMLF-9\n\n10:1:14/9\n\nMLR-1\nMLR-2\nMLR-20\nMLR-21\nMLR-30\n\n1:0.54\n1 :0.54\n1:0.27\n1:0.27\n10 :0.21\n\nIngredients and percent solids\nby weight\nMoS, (51), graphite (5), gold (26), sodium\nsilicate (18)\nMoS, (57), graphite (6), bismuth (17), sodium\nsilicate (20)\nMoS, (51), graphite (5), gold (26), potassium\nsilicate (12), sodium fluoride (6)\nMoS, (50), graphite (5), gold (25), aluminum\nphosphate (20)\nMoS, (34), graphite (4), bismuth (47), aluminum phosphate (15)\nMoS, (75), Sb,O, (25), polyimide\nMoS, (55), Sb,O, (45), polyimide\nMoS, (75), Sb,O, (25), pyrrone\nMoS, (go), graphite (lo), pyrrone\nMoS, (89), graphite (l),\ngold (5), glass resin\n\nSPECIFICATIONS\nMoS,-Type Z and microsize, Dow Corning Corp., Stamford, Conn.\nGraphite-No. 635, Joseph Dixon Crucible Co., Jersey City, N.J.\nGold-Fine powder 324 mesh, Goldsmith Brothers, Chicago, Ill.\nBismuth-Fine powder 325 mesh K 710, Electronic Space Products, Inc., Los\nAngeles, Calif.\nSodium silicate-Type K, Philadelphia Quartz Co., Philadelphia, Pa.\nAluminum phosphate-50 percent solution, Stauffer Chemical Co., New York,\nN.Y.\nPolyirnide-P14+701 and PI1101, E.

However, they do not exhibit all of the good qualities of the polyimide-bonded materials.\nAt the same time, certain of their characteristics do offer some\nadvantages. For example, it has been determined (ref. 24) that the\npyrrone HR-100 material can be cured in a thin-film bonded solid\nlubricant at temperatures as low as 250\' F. This lower cure temperature would allow their use in areas where the 575\' F cure temperature used for the polyimide resins would be objectionable. Although\nthe pyrrone-bonded materials are rather new, some information has\nbeen generated and is documented in reference 24.\nSeveral organizations, including Midwest Research Institute,\nhave investigated a series of glass-resin binders for use with solidlubricant materials. One such material is the MLR-30 listed in\ntable VI. The glass-resin-bonded solid lubricants do not exhibit\nextremely long wear-lives when evaluated on the standard Falex\ntest machine, but they do offer several other advantages. These\nadvantages are air curing and their ability to adhere to metal\nsubstrates without the necessity of elaborate pretreatment of the\nsurface. Preliminary work on these materials has been conducted\non a NASA contract (ref. 24).\n\nCERAMIC-SONDE0 CALCIUM FLUORIDE SOLID LUBRICANT\n\nAs early as 1950, personnel at the Lewis Flight Propulsion\nLaboratory were experimenting with bonded solid-film lubricants.\nMuch of their early work involved new methods of binding the\nlubricants to metal substrates and determination of film endurance\ncharacteristics (ref. 1).In the 1956-1958 period, they became involved in the development of lubricants for use in the 400\xc2\xb0 to\n1000\xc2\xb0 F temperature range. I n one such investigation (ref. 33), lead\noxide (PbO) was tested and found to be an effective lubricant in the\nrange of 500\' to 1250" F. At 1250\' F, this coating had a coefficient\nof friction that varied from 0.10 to 0.25,depending on the thickness\nof the applied film. The lowest friction and wear occurred with a\ncoating 0.0005 in. thick. Experiments conducted at the Lewis Research Center indicated that this film had significantly longer endurance life at temperatures in excess of 500" F than at room\ntemperature. Also, the room temperature endurance life was at\nleast as good a s that of a conventionally bonded MoS, film tested\nunder the same conditions. The testing of this film and of the CaF,\nfilm described later was accomplished with equipment similar to\nthat described in chapter 5 and shown in figure 2.\nThe PbO-SiO, film did not become popular in the solid lubricant\n\n24\n\nSOLID LUBRICANTS\nFRICTION\nFORCE\n\nRIDER-\\\n\nSUPPORT BEARING SPINDLE?\n\nCOOLANT WA\n\nELECTRICAL INS\nCOAXIAL\nFEED THR\n\nFIGURE\n2.-NASA\n\nhigh-temperature friction apparatus.\n\nindustry, but it is probable that the material Electrofilm 1000\nmentioned in chapter 2 is an outgrowth of this work.\nIn an effort to develop lubricants for use a t still higher temperatures, the Lewis group initiated a program to investigate the feasibility of using various oxide and halide compounds as the lubricating solids in bonded solid-film lubricants (ref. 34). In these investigations the material had to be stable in air and of low volatility to\n1500\' F. Other properties considered important were high melting\npoint, low water solubility, and crystal properties that are conducive to a low coefficient of friction, such as the presence of easily\nsheared lattice planes. The group concluded that of the materials\ninvestigated only CaF,, BaF2, and LiF merited further investigation.\nAlong with the investigation to determine the best solid lubricants, a program was conducted to develop binder materials. Coefficients of friction for the ceramic coatings were found to be\nbetween 0.3 and 0.4 over the range of 75" to 1500" F. One ceramic\ncomposition containing a high percentage of cobalt oxide (COO)\nwas found to be an effective binder for the CaF, coating. The\nceramic-bonded CaF, lubricant film (ref. 35) has now been patented\n(ref. 36). This film is recommended for use on nickel alloys over\nthe temperature range of 500" to 1900" F in both a i r atmosphere\n\n25\n\nNEW DEVELOPMENTS\n\nand hard vacuum. The material can be thinned with water and\napplied by spraying, brushing, o r dipping. A coating thickness of\n0.0008 to 0.0035 in. is recommended, 0.001 to 0.002 in. being the\nmost desirable.\nAs with the resin-bonded solid lubricants, pretreatment of the\nmetal substrate will affect film performance. Oxidizing of the\nmetal substrate in air a t 2000" F, until a deep blue oxide film is\nformed, imparts the best endurance life to the film. An overlay of\npure CaF, also increases wear-life but tends to increase the coefficient of friction. The composition of the films should be as shown\nin table VI1 (ref. 36).\n\nTABLE\nVI1.-The\n\nBinder\n\n[All figures in percent by weight]\nSuitable\nrange\nCobalt oxide (COO)\nBarium oxide (BaO)\nBoric oxide (B,O,)\n\nPreferred\nrange\n\nMost\npreferred\n\n40-70\n10-30\n10-30\n\n55-65\n15-25\n17-23\n\n60\n20\n20\n\nThe pigment (lubricating solid CaF,) to binder ratio can vary\nwithin wide limits, the most preferred ratio being 3 :l.The effects\nof binder content on friction and wear a t various temperatures\nare given in table VIII.\nIn further studies of the fluoride materials, Sliney (refs. 37 and\n38) impregnated various nickel and nickel chromium alloys with a\nbarium fluoride/calcium fluoride eutectic. The porous alloys were\nvacuum-impregnated with the fluoride composition at 2000" F.\nFriction and wear properties of the resultant bodies were determined in air and gaseous hydrogen at temperatures from 80" to\n1500" F. Higher coefficients of friction were obtained on the composites than on dense metal substrates lubricated with coatings\ncomposed of the same fluoride composition. The advantages of coatings (low friction) and of the composites (long life) were combined\nby applying a thin sintered film of the eutectic fluoride to the porous\ncomposite. In a hydrogen atmosphere a t a sliding velocity of 2000\nft/min, friction values ranged from 0.06 at 1500" F to 0.20 a t 80" F.\nFriction values were higher in an air atmosph,ere, 0.20 over the\nrange of 750\xc2\xb0 to 1500\' F ; at lower temperatures, the friction values\nincreased to 0.35. Friction values also increased as sliding velocity\ndecreased.\n\n26\n\nSOLID LUBRICANTS\n\nTABLE\nVII1.-Effects\n\nof Binder Content on Calcium Fluoride Solid\nLubricant\n\nEffect of ceramic content on coefficient of friction\n500" F\n1 part binder to 9 parts CaF,\n1 part binder to 4 parts CaF,\n1 part binder to 3 parts CaF,\n1 part binder to 1 part CaF,\n4 parts binder to 1 part CaF,\n\n1000\xc2\xb0F\n\n1200\xc2\xb0F\n\n1500\xc2\xb0F\n\n0.30\n0.22\n0.30\n0.49\n\n0.16\n0.18\n0.12\n0.16\n-\n\n0.08\n0.07\n0.11\n0.35\n\n0.10\n0.08\n0.15\n0.20\n0.15\n\n-\n\nEffect of ceramic content on endurance life (in number of test cycles to failure)\n500\xc2\xb0F\n\n1 part binder to 9 parts CaF,\n1 part binder to 4 parts CaF,\n1 part binder to 3 parts CaF,\n1 part binder to 1 part CaF,\n4 parts binder to 1 part CaF,\n1\n\n1OOO\'F\n\n1200\xc2\xb0F\n\n1500\xc2\xb0F\n\n2,000\n\n14,000\n21,000\n\n38,000\n19,000\n\n(1)\n\n17,000\n17,000\n29,000\n28,000\n43,000\n\n(1)\n\n(1)\n\n24,000\n\n(\'1\n\n3,000\n\n-\n\n25,000\n3,000\n\nNo failure after 50,000 cycles.\n\nOTHER FLUORIDE FILMS\n\nResearchers at Midwest Research Institute have developed a\nseries of films designed to utilize the desirable friction and wear\ncharacteristics of the fluoride materials. They have found that the\naddition of monoaluminum phosphate to the lubricant enhances\nboth its friction and wear-life characteristics.\nThe outstanding feature of these fluoride films is their ability to\nfunction effectively over a wide range of temperatures in both air\nand vacuum. Wear-lives of up to 1000 000 load cycles have been\nobtained on these fluoride films when tested on the Mark V double\nrub-shoe tester described in chapter 5. The most effective temperature range for these materials has been found to be from 500" t o\n1400\xc2\xb0F. In this range, the coefficient of friction remains below 0.20.\nAs determined by testing the films are usable at temperatures below\n500\xc2\xb0 F, although their wear-lives are shortened and friction values\nincrease t o a range of 0.25 to 0.35. In a limited number of tests these\nfilms exhibited coefficients of friction and wear-lives in a vacuum\ntorr similar to those obtained in air.\nof\nWork is continuing at Midwest Research Institute on the development of fluoride-based solid lubricants with special emphasis on\n\nNEW DEVELOPMENTS\n\n\'\n\n27\n\nimproving the room temperature performance while retaining the\noutstanding high-temperature performance.\nLike many other high-temperature solid-lubricant films, fluoride\nmaterials have certain disadvantages in that they have extremely\nhigh curing temperatures, up to 1800" F ; this has limited their use\nto the superalloys. The possibility exists that these materials can\nbe flame-sprayed. If this becomes a reality, then applications should\nbe substantially increased because the surfaces onto which they are\napplied can be kept cool during the coating process and thus eliminate the need for using only superalloy substrates.\nVITROLUBE\n\nVitrolube is the trade name of a ceramic-bonded solid lubricant\ndeveloped by the North American Rockwell Corp. (ref. 39) to withstand the stringent load and temperature conditions encountered\nduring the operation of the XB-70A, Mach 3 aircraft. Vitrolube\ncontains molybdenum disulfide and graphite in the ratio of 7 :2. The\nglass (ceramic) binder is a combination of glasses which has not\npreviously been utilized in any known dry lubricant coating. The\nmanufacturer states that all components of the coating, including\nthe binder, possess lubricating properties.\nA Vitrolube-bonded solid-lubricant coating has been extensively\nevaluated under conditions closely representing actual use in aerospace vehicles. Results have shown the material to be greatly\nsuperior to other materials whmen tested a t approximately 700\' F.\nThe Vitrolube material, however, does have some disadvantages.\nThe coating, as is true of most other bonded lubricant films, does\nnot exhibit good corrosion protection ; and completely corrosionresistant substrates must be used to eliminate the problem. Contamination of the wear surfaces by any fluid is detrimental.\nThe use of Vitrolube is limited to metals that can withstand the\nhigh curing temperature required to fuse the ceramic binder. Although developed specifically for use on the XB-70 airplane, a license has been granted to a solid-lubricant supplier, and the material is now commercially available from the company indicated\nin chapter 2.\nGRAPHITE FLUORIDE\n\nFusaro and Sliney (ref. 40) at the NASA Lewis Research Center\nhave evaluated a new material as a solid lubricant. This material,\ngraphite fluoride, has been known for some time but had not been\nextensively evaluated as a lubricating solid.\nA preliminary investigation of the graphite fluoride material was\n\n28\n\nSOLID LUBRICANTS\n\nconducted on burnished films of the material. Friction and wear\ntests were pursued on the NASA pin-on-disk sliding-friction apparatus. For comparative purposes, similar tests were conducted on\nburnished films of graphite and molybdenum disulfide. Fusaro et a1\n(ref. 40) report that the graphite fluoride exhibited coefficients of\nfriction equal to or superior to those of molybdenum disulfide and/\nor graphite. The wear-life of the burnished graphite fluoride films\nwas up to six times greater than those obtained with graphite or\nmolybdenum disulfide. They also found that moist atmosphere increased the wear-lives of graphite fluoride films, but that it also\nincreased the coefficients of friction.\nFor practical application, the graphite fluoride solid lubricant is\nlimited to a temperature of approximately 750" F, which is comparable to the usable range of molybdenum disulfide in air.\nRARE EARTH FLUORIDES AND OXIDES\n\nOther materials being investigated as possible solid lubricants at\nLewis Research Center are the powdered lanthanide trifluorides\nsuch as LaF, and CeF,. Sliney found (refs. 41 and 42) that significant reductions in wear were obtained when Inconel 600 and\nInconel 750 were lubricated with the aforementioned materials in\nsliding experiments. He also found that the rare earth oxides were\nnot film formers, but he does indicate that fusion-bonded LaF, and\nCeF, coatings containing CaF,-BaF, eutectic or LiF as melting\npoint depressants have possibilities as solid-lubricant coatings.\n\nCHAPTER 4\n\nOther Solid Lubricants\nIn the previous chapters, only the thin-film bonded solid lubricants have been discussed. In addition to these, there are several\nother types or forms of solid-lubricant materials which may be of\nmore or of equal importance and which are finding increasingly\nwide use in many industries. This chapter will briefly deal with a\nnumber of these materials.\nLUBRICATING SOLIDS AS ADDITIVES\n\nSeveral solid-lubricant materials are added to oils and greases to\nimprove their lubricity and extreme-pressure characteristics. By\nf a r the most frequently used solid lubricants for this purpose are\nmolybdenum disulfide and graphite; Teflon and compounds of lead\nhave also been used. Solid-lubricant additives tend to prevent or\ndelay seizure in places where the film of oil or grease is disrupted by\nhigh stress or loss of lubricant for finite time intervals. Lubricants\ncontaining these additives are used in large quantities by mechanical and electrical manufacturers, equipment-maintenance and\nautomotive industries, as well a s government and military agencies.\nThe total quantity of such lubricants used is not known, but it is\nlarge ; the U.S. Navy alone utilizes over 100 000 lb each year in aircraft, catapults, and other shipboard machinery. Certain automotive companies specify a barium stearate-MoS, lubricant for balljoint applications. The electrical industry uses filled-grease lubricants in switchgear, home appliances, and in the assembly and\nrun-in of large stators.\nThe quantity of lubricating solids added to grease and oil lubricants varies from 0.5 percent to as much as 60 percent. For genera!\nuse, a grease containing 5 percent of the lubricating solid is generally the most effective. The choice of quantity and type of additive\nrequired will undoubtedly depend on the application.\nJudging from the number of manufacturers of liquid lubricants\nand the quantities being produced, this is probably one of the largest uses of molybdenum disulfide and graphite. Greases containing\nTeflon and other additives are also available.\n29\n\n30\n\nSOLID LUBRICANTS\n\nLUBRICATING PLASTICS\n\nPlastic bearings fulfill a need that cannot be satisfied by metal\nbearings. It is desirable and often necessary to reduce or eliminate\nthe lubrication requirements of bearings, and properly designed\nnonlubricated plastic bearings can often solve this problem. These\nplastic bearings can also help eliminate problems resulting from :\nhigh rate of wear, lubricant failure, chemical corrosion, stick-slip\nmotion, inaccessibility for lubrication, and high- or low-operating\ntemperatures.\nPLASTIC BEARINGS\n\nPlastic bearings can be fabricated in any of the conventional\nbearing configurations such as journal, thrust, combination thrust\nand journal, flat strip, or special shape (fig, 3).\nIn addition, thcermoplastic bearings can often be incorporated\ndirectly in the molded housing of a conveyor-roll end bell, where the\nhousing and bearing are one piece (fig. 4). These bearing materials\ncan be manufactured by injection molding, compression molding, or\nmachining of basic shapes. The final configuration and selected material will determine the most suitable means of fabrication.\nCONSTRUCTION MATERIALS\n\nSelf-lubricated plastic bearings usually are fabricated from nylon, acetals, tetrafluoroethylene (TFE), polyimides, and phenolics.\n\nFIGURE\n3.-Bearing configurations available in plastic bearings.\n\nOTHER SOLID LUBRICANTS\n\n31\n\nFIGURE\n4.-Conveyor roller and caps of duPont Zytel molded resin.\n\nThese materials are often compounded or blended with other lubricating materials to improve performance.\nNylon is well known for its low friction and good wear, and performs well with little or no lubrication. It swells slightly when exposed to high humidity; under excessive static loads it tends to take\na permanent set. A steel sleeve around a nylon bearing reduces cold\nflow and improves heat dissipation. Wear is less for hardened shafts\nwith a surface finish of 8 to 16 ,U in. or finer ; chromium plating tends\nto further reduce wear.\nGlass fiber fillers in nylon reduce cold flow and thermal expansion,\nbut increase the coefficient of friction. Friction and wear can be\nreduced by dry-lubricant fillers such as molybdenum disulfide,\ngraphite, and TFE. Small additions of the MoS, fillers may also\nincrease the strength.\nAcetals cost less than any of the other plastics and have good\nstrength and stiffness. Dynamic and static coefficients of friction\nare the same, and there is essentially no stick-slip effect a t low\nspeeds or in starting. The coefficient of friction against a steel\nshaft is comparable to nylon. Because of their relatively low cost\nand good structural properties, acetals are often used as mechanical\nparts of housings; for example, if a bearing surface is needed, un-\n\n32\n\nSOLID LUBRICANTS\n\nfilled acetals can provide good bearing performance without added\nparts.\nPowdered TFE resin or molybdenum disulfide, when added to\nthese plastics in compounding, serves as a dry lubricant to reduce\nfriction and wear. Glass fiber increases stiffness and reduces\nthermal expansion. T F E fibers reduce friction and impart a very\nhigh degree of resistance to wear,\nT F E has the lowest friction of any plastic, and its coefficient of\nfriction decreases with load. This resin is resistant to heat, but, like\nmost plastics, is a poor thermal conductor. Except for the fiber form,\nit needs fillers to provide resistance to cold flow. In addition, fillers\nincrease the load-carrying capacity and reduce the bearing size requirement, the amount of plastic required, and the cost. Thin TFE\nliners supported by steel bushings also reduce the amount of plastic\nrequired, aid in heat dissipation, and permit the use of assembly\nclearances usual for metal bushings.\nWhen fillers of glass fiber, graphite, and powdered bronze are\nblended with T F E resin, the PV values" are about 10 000 at low\nspeeds and over twice as much a t speeds of 1000 ft/min. Some\nwork being done with powdered metal fillers points to still higher\nPV values with a helpful increase in thermal conductivity, decreased\nload deflection, and large reductions in wear.\nStill another approach combines the low friction of T F E resins\nwith the stiffness and strength of metal. A composite thin layer of\nporous bronze sintered to a steel backing impregnated with a mixture of T F E resin and powdered lead is a n example. P V values are\nabout the same as for oil-impregnated sintered bronze. At low\nspeeds, steady loads can go up to 20 000 psi with coefficients of friction of 0.05 to 0.1 ; a t speeds of 1000 ft/min, the coefficient nearly\ndoubles.\nVarious fibers (such as fiber glass, nylon, cotton) when combined\nwith T F E have an extremely high load-carrying ability. In this\nform they can support loads u p to 40 000 psi. Voids in the fabric\nand thin layers eliminate the problem of thermal expansion when\nused with a metal backing. However, because of low thermal conductivity, these bearings are limited to low-speed applications. Another limiting factor results from the method of their construction.\nThese fibers are usually bonded to a backing, and as the temperature goes up the bond tends to weaken, limiting the surface speed\nto about 100 ft/min.\nPhenolic plastic bushings have good resistance to cold flow, high\n\n* The PV value is the product of load on the projected bearing area (psi) and\nthe surface velocity (ftimin).\n\nOTHER SOLID LUBRICANTS\n\n33\n\nstrength, and high-service temperature, but have higher friction\nand poor resistance to abrasion. Nevertheless, wear-life can be increased and coefficient of friction reduced by the use of fillers and\nlubricating additives such as TFE resin. In one line of molded bushings, three lubricants are added : graphite, molybdenum disulfide,\nand a viscous oil. Fiber fillers arranged radially serve a s wicks for\nthe oil ; when the bearing warms up and the lubricant flows along\nthe fibers, it produces a true hydrodynamic bearing. This type of\nbearing will handle combinations of speed and load comparable to\nsintered bronze bearings with equal or better wear-life and lower\ncoefficient of friction. The thickness of the wall is at least \'/4 in.\nPolyimides have the highest PV value of any organic material.\nPV values as high as 100 000 psi a t 100 ft/min have been achieved,\nalthough in some cases there has been rapid wear. Polyimides are\nusable over a wide temperature range of from -4OOO to +700" F.\nSome may even withstand short exposure to temperature up to\n900" F without serious damage. When filled with graphite, the\nwear rate and friction of the polyimide decrease considerably.\nTable IX shows some of the mechanical properties-coefficient\nof\nfriction, wear factor, PV,and effect of temperature for the bearing\nmaterials described.\nDESIGN CONSIDERATIONS\n\nThe satisfactory use of a plastic-based bearing depends primarily\non three factors : coefficient of friction, wear resistance, and cost.\nFriction and wear properties will dictate conditions such as load\nspeed and temperature a t which each material can be used\neffectively.\nPV and Wear\n\nThe successful use of any nonlubricated plastic bearing depends\nupon its load velocity PV capability and wear rate under different\nservice conditions. Limiting PV defines the maximum load and\nvelocity of a material, ignoring the considerations of wear. The\nlimiting PV can indicate whether or not a bearing material should\nbe considered for a specific application.\nSince wear is inevitable in a nonlubricated rubbing contact bearing, the design is concerned with the amount of wear. This wear can\nbe determined using a wear factor K , a proportionality constant relating radial wear R to load P,velocity V,and time T,in the following equation :\n\nR = KPTV.\n\n34\n\nSOLID LUBRICANTS\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n0\n\nIn\n\n3\n0\n\nm\n\n0\n0\n\n0\nM\n\n0\n\n0\n\n(\n0\n\n0\n\n>o\n\n;0J 0\n\n2\n0\n0\n\nm\n\n0.1\n\n0\n\n0\n0\n\nr(\n\n0\n0\n\nm\n\n0\n0\n\nm\n\n0\n0\n-Y\n\ns\n0\n\n0\n\n0\nr4\n\n0\n0\n\nE3\n\n0\n0\n\nM\n\nC\n\n0\n\nN\n\n0\n0\n(\n0\n\nA\n\n0\n0\nv)\n\n0\n0\n0\n\n0\n0\nM\n\n0\n0\n0\n\n0\n0\n-Y\n\nrl\n\nrl\n\n-F;\n\n5c\n2 0\n0\n\n;2\n\nOTHER SOLID LUBRICANTS\n\n35\n\nFigure 5, which is based on this equation, is a nomograph that\nrelates PV with unit wear per 1000 h r of operation at various\n\xe2\x80\x9cwear-factor\xe2\x80\x9d levels. The designer can determine an allowable PV\nfrom this information, if he knows the allowable wear of a given\napplication and the wear factor of a particular bearing material.\nConversely, having established a required PV level, unit wear can\nbe reasonably predicted.\nClearances\n\nThe design for plastic journal bearings requires that proper\nrunning clearances on the shaft be specified. Because of the high\nthermal expansion of most plastics, these bearings require larger\nclearances than those normally used with metal bearings. In some\ncases, the possible disadvantages of these large clearances are overcome by the resilience and vibration-dampening effects of the\nplastic. The recommended clearance for most nonlubricated plastic\nbearings is 0.005 in./in. of shart diam for solid journal bearings.\nIf a split-curl configuration is used to eliminate seizing, clearances\ncan be reduced to 0.001 in./in.\nShaft Finish\n\nMost plastic bearings can be used either as molded or machined,\nas the surface finish on the plastic bearing is not critical. The\nmating shaft should have a finish of 8 to 16 p in. rms for best performance. Too smooth a surface is unnecessarily expensive and\n\n.-\n\nE\n\nrr\na\n\nW\n\n.ing,\n:ional ly\n\n3\n\nFIGURE\n5.-Radial wear vs PV as a function of wear factor.\n\n36\n\nSOLID LUBRICANTS\n\nrougher surfaces tend to abrade the bearing. The effect of shaft\nfinish on the wear of T F E bearings is shown in figure 6.\nCOST CONSIDERATIONS\n\nCost is, of course, an important consideration in the selection of\nbearing material. On a raw material basis the acetals are the least\ncostly, followed by nylon, phenolics, fluorocarbons, and polyimides.\nHowever, raw material costs do not necessarily give a good indication of the cost of finished parts. For instance, when using nylon\nand acetals it may be possible to incorporate the bearing directly\nin the injection-molded housing, eliminating the need for a separate\npiece and an assembly operation. Fluorocarbon bearings are often\nfabricated in a thin tape that is inserted in a housing a t very low\ncost compared to a solid-machined bearing. At the present time, the\npolyimide bearing is expensive, but if the designer is faced with a\nsevere nonlubricated bearing problem it will usually pay for itself.\nIn any plastic bearing design the real criterion is value in use.\nPractically every industry has used or can use nonlubricated plastic\nbearings. Some typical applications are included as figures 7\nthrough 17.\nPOWDERED SOLID LUBRICANTS\n\nThe simplest and oldest form of solid lubrication, still widely\nused, merely involves applying lubricating solids to the surfaces\n\n4.\n\n3.1\nE\n\na\n\nW\n\n3\nW\n\n2\n\n2.(\n\nFIGURE6.-Effect of shaft\nfinish on wear of Teflon bearings.\n\nI-\n\n4\n\nW\n\nE\n\nC\n\nI\n\n4\n\nI\n\n8\n\n12\n\nI\n\n16\n\n20\n\n24\n\nSHAFT F I N I S H , M I CRO I NCHES (RMS)\n\n28\n\nOTHER SOLID LUBRICANTS\n*>\n\n1\n\n37\n\ni\n\nFIGURE\n7.-Spherical bearings\nlined with fabrics of Teflon.\n\nFIGURE\n&-Bearing retainers\nof Delrin acetal resin.\n\nFIGURE\n9.-Ball bearing retainers of filled Teflon resin.\n\n38\n\nSOLID LUBRICANTS\n\nFIGURE\n11.-Self-aligning\nZytel resin.\n\nbearing of\n\nFIGURE\n12.-Self-aligning\nbearing\nand housing of Delrin A F fiberhesin\nand Zytel resin, respectively.\n\nFIGURE\n13.-Elevator\ngibs of Zytel\nresin.\n\nFIGURE\n14.-Self-aligning\nof Zytel resin.\n\nbearings\n\n~\n\nOTHER SOLID LUBRICANTS\n\n39\n\nFIGURE\n15.-Manure spreader bushings of Teflon resin.\n\nFIGURE16.-Glide pads of Teflon\nresin.\n\nFIGURE\n1\'7.-Door-pivot bearings of\nglass-filled tape of Teflon resin.\n\n40\n\nSOLID LUBRICANTS\n\nrequiring lubrication. A wide variety of powdered solids can be used.\nI n this method, the lubricating film is formed on the bearing or\nwearing surface by merely covering the surface with a finely divided\nlubricant powder. The resultant film reduces both friction and wear\nof the mating surfaces. Bonding to the metal substrate depends upon\nintimate contact between the lubricant powder and metal substrate\nand their affinity for each other. The surface roughness of the\nsubstrate may also create small reservoirs and trap the loose powder\nwhich produces some increase in adhesion.\nMethods of application include rubbing, burnishing, dusting,\ntumbling, and aerosol spraying.\nRubbing.-Distributing\nthe lubricant powder over the bearing\narea by rubbing with the hands is a common method. This usually\nproduces a very loose coating, but is effective in the assembly of\nclose tolerance parts.\nBurnishing.-This procedure is the same as for rubbing except a\ngreater force is applied, usually by some mechanical means. The\ngreater load will compact more lubricant into the surface imperfections and usually result in a longer lasting film. After burnishing,\nthe coating will be smooth and glossy. This method is suitable for\nparts whose wear-lives are not critically important.\nDusting.-In this method, no attempt is made to distribute the\npowder evenly, resulting in an uneven and generally unsatisfactory\ncoating.\nTumbling.-Coating is accomplished by mixing normal tumbling\nmedia (such as balls, spheres, cones, and needles) with dry powder.\nParts to be coated are then placed in this mixture and tumbled for\na period of time. Although adhesion is not good in this method, it is\nsuitable for coating noncritical items such as small threaded fasteners and rivets. Care must be taken when using a dry lubricant on\nthreaded fasteners because the accepted dry-torque levels are not\napplicable.\nAerosol Spraying.-In this method, a finely divided lubricant is\napplied using an aerosol spray with a volatile carrier such as alcohol\nor Freon. Again, adhesion is not good, but the ease of application\nmay offset this disadvantage.\nThe solid-lubricant powders that can be used by these application methods include molybdenum disulfide, graphite, mica, Teflon,\ntalc, and tetrafluoroethylene. These powders can be used in forming,\npress-fitting, and wire-drawing operations ; and with fasteners\n(threaded and rivet) and dies.\nThe use of the powdered materials is usually limited to areas\nwhere adhesion of the lubricant is not critical. Many of the methods\nof application discussed in previous chapters were developed as a\n\nOTHER SOLID LUBRICANTS\n\n41\n\nLUBRICANT COMPOSITES\n\nI\n\nThe lubricant composites to be discussed here are mixtures of\nlubricating and metal powders compacted under high load a t elevated temperatures to form a solid body containing a high percentage of lubricating material. A solid lubricant is transferred from\nwithin the structure of the composite to the interface between the\nmoving parts, forming an effective lubricating film.\nIn 1950, personnel at the Lewis Flight Propulsion Laboratory (now\nLewis Research Center) investigated the feasibility of lubricating\nbearings in this manner. They also established the amount of lubricant necessary for such a bearing material. An investigation of a\ncomposition containing MoS,, silver, and copper (ref. 48) indicated\nthat effective lubrication could be obtained with a material containing 10 percent MoS,, 5 percent copper, and 85 percent silver, and\nthat this material gave the lowest rate of wear with a relatively\nlow-friction value. The friction appeared to be unaffected by sliding\nvelocity. Welding of the surfaces occurred with composites containing less than 5 percent of the MoS2 lubricating powder.\nOther investigators have used this method of lubricating ball and\nroller bearings. Campbell and Van Wyk (refs. 49 and 50) reported\non the development of a lubricant composite in which they were\n\n42\n\nSOLID LUBRICANTS\n\nattempting to lubricate 204-size bearings operating in air and in a\nvacuum of\ntorr at 1500O F. Their report mentions between 400\nand 500 different material combinations that were fabricated during their investigation. Unlike the Lewis investigators, they used\nextremely high percentages of lubricating powders (e.g., MoS, and\nPbO) and hard metal binders, rather than silver. In this work, the\ntwo best materials were reported to be 90 percent MoS,, 8 percent\nFe, and 2 percent Pt ; and 90 percent MoS,, 8 percent Fe, and 2 percent Pd. Operation of the 204-size bearings was achieved at speeds\nto 15000 rpm in a vacuum of\ntorr, at 700" F. The lubricant\ncomposite supplied enough lubricant to the moving surfaces so that\na very thin, highly burnished lubricant film was maintained. This\nwork demonstrated also that lubricant composite materials can be\nmade with sufficient strength to warrant their use as cage materials\nfor bearings.\nComposite development at The Boeing Co. has been continued\nwith later work being reported by Hubbell et a1 (ref. 51). Bowen et a1\n(refs. 52 through 55) of the Westinghouse Electric Corp. also have\ndone considerable developmental work on lubricant composites.\nThey have included such lubricant powders as polytetrafluoroethylene, graphite, antimony sulfide (Sb,S,), iron sulfide (FeS),\nselenides and tellurides of tungsten, and molybdenum. Work on\nthese programs has been mainly on the lubrication of gears and\nrelated equipment. Other investigators, including Devine (ref. 56),\nhave compacted the common solid-film lubricants into solid sections\nfor use as bearing components.\nOne problem usually associated with a new idea or product, such\nas metal-bonded composites, is transferring it from research to practical use. At least one company has taken the initiative in this area\nand is now offering several of the Boeing-developed composite materials for sale (ref. 57). The metal-bonded lubricants have been\nused successfully in the field of electrical brushes and contacts,\nparticularly in vacuum applications.\nUlrich (ref. 58) has summarized work completed on hot-pressed\nMoS2-Ag electric contact motor brushes. He stated that compositions of hot-pressed MoS, containing metallic additives have shown\npromise as materials for electric contact brushes in vacuum. He\nfurther stated that the brushes studied have properties of degenerated semiconductors and that the analysis conducted indicated that\nthe best combination would be a mixture of 80.5 percent MoS,-19.5\npercent silver. Testing of brushes of the best combination appears to\nconfirm the results of the analysis.\nDemorest and Whitaker (ref. 59) investigated new brush materials for low wear and good electric contact by evaluating the ma-\n\nOTHER SOLID LUBRICANTS\n\n43\n\nterials in dc motors running in vacuum. They found several materials that gave reasonably good results, including NbSe, (niobium\ndiselenide), NbSe,\n20 percent MoS,, TaS, (tantalum disulfide)\ngraphite NbSe,, and WSe, + silver, but certain difficulties\nwere encountered with each of these formulations. The NbSe, and\nNbSe, MoS, brushes were brittle and chipped badly. The TaS,\ngraphite NbSe, brushes caused severe wear on the commutator,\nand the WSe, silver brushes wore severely during a relatively\nshort test.\nThe best results were obtained by Demorest and Whitaker (ref.\n59) when they used, for a brush material, a metal-bonded composition that had been fabricated specifically for a cage material in\nrolling-element bearings. This material contains molybdenum disulfide, molybdenum, and tantalum (manufacturers\xe2\x80\x99 designation\n046-45). Some typical properties of this material are given in table\nX. In motor tests under vacuum conditions the 046-45 brush mate-\n\n+\n\n+\n\n+\n\n+\n\n+\n\n+\n\n+\n\nTABLE\nX.-Typical\n\nProperties of 046-45 Brush Material\n\nDensity . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\nFlexible strength . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\nCompressive strength . . . . . . . . . . . .\nShear strength . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\nComposition . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .\n\n. 5 . 6 g/cc\n. 1 2 480 1biin.z\n. 4 9 000 lbiin.2\n,8000 1biin.Z\n(proprietary) contains MoS,, Mo, and Ta\n\nrial was found to have a wear rate of approximately\nin./hr.\nThese brushes caused little wear on the commutator and little or\nno arcing. It appears that the 046-45 brush material does have a\nslightly higher wear rate when tested in air, on the order of lo-*\nin./hr.\nAdditional work is being done at Marshall Space Flight Center on\nelectric brush material. Other investigations have been or are being\nconducted on electric brushes composed of metal and lubricant\npowders by personnel a t Goddard and Marshall Space Flight Centers (refs. 60 through 62) and a t the Lockheed Missiles and Space\nCo. (now Lockheed Aircraft Corp.) (refs. 63 and 64).\nSOLID-LUBRICANT LAMINATES\n\nLaminate materials have been developed which are of some interest because of their relatively high-bearing strength (10 000 to 38 000\npsi) and hardness (R, > 100). Generally, these materials are made\nof layers of paper, cloth, fiber glass, or nylon fabric with resin and\nMoS,, graphite, or Teflon compressed under pressure and heat. PV\n\n44\n\nSOLID LUBRICANTS\n\nvalues for these materials range from 10 000 a t 10 ft/min to 30 000\nat 1000 ft/min, and the wear factor K ranges from 15 to 40 in.3\nmin/ft. lb-hr.\nThe coefficient of friction of laminate materials is relatively high\nfor lubricating solids, ranging from 0.17 to 0.21. The temperature\nranges for these materials are limited by the fabric and resin employed, which generally restrict them to a maximum temperature\nof 400" F.\n\nCHAPTER 5\n\nMethods of Evaluating Solid Lubricants\nMethods of evaluating solid-film dry lubricants are numerous.\nNearly every major user of bonded solid films has his own particular\ntest machine for evaluating the wear-life and obtaining the coefficient of friction of materials over the range of conditions that he\nfeels is important. In addition to the wear-life and friction tests,\nthere are minor tests which are nearly standard throughout industry. These minor tests include film adhesion, fluid resistance, heat\nresistance, and corrosion resistance. Most of the minor tests are\nfully described in the applicable specifications, Federal test method\nstandards, or ASTM test method standards.\nSuch a wide variation in test results on film life has been reported\nby various organizations, that the Coordinating Research Council\n(CRC) conducted a round-robin test program in a n effort to determine the correlation, if any, between two of the most widely accepted test machines, the Falex and MacMillan. The conclusions\ndrawn showed no correlation between these two machines. Also,\nvery little repeatability existed between testers of the same machine in different laboratories. The CRC did find that more repeatability existed between laboratories using the Falex tester than\nthose using the MacMillan tester. On the basis of these findings, the\ngovernment agency having cognizance over the solid-lubricant\nspecifications switched to the Falex machine and now requires its\nuse in all solid-film lubricant qualification testing.\nThe American Society of Lubrication Engineers\xe2\x80\x99 Subcommittee\non Wear of the Lubrication Fundamentals Committee (ref. 65) has\ncompiled information on over 100 test machines used in the evaluation of lubricants. Devine (ref. 66) has compiled a list of test\nmachines (table XI) frequently used in the evaluation of solid\nlubricants.\nMost of the test data on solid dry lubricants result from the measurement of the friction and wear characteristics in bench-type\nlaboratory tests on full-scale bearings. Some chemical tests have\nbeen used for evaluating solid-lubricant properties, but these serve\nmore as specification controls than as developmental tools. Because\nno single organization has attempted to design and construct a\nstandard test machine for dry lubricants, the industry has relied\n45\n\n46\n\nSOLID LUBRICANTS\n\nTABLE\nXI.-Examples o f Friction and Wear Test Apparatus\nf o r Solid Lubricants\nName\nPlain Bearing Tester\n\nConditions\n1. 630" F\n\n2. lOcpm\n3. 2 3 2 deg/cycle\n4. 10,OOOpsi\n1. 7 7 \xc2\xb0 F\nFriction Tester\n2. 65cm/sec\n3.

The lack of\nstandard methods of evaluation has created problems in comparing\nthe results of various tests. Additionally, many of the solid lubricants do not lend themselves to standardization of test methods.\nFRICTION A N D WEAR TESTERS\n\nAlthough a wide variety of friction and wear testers have been\nused for the evaluation of solid lubricants, only the most common\ntest machines (table XII) will be discussed in this chapter.\nFalex Lubricant Tester\n\nSince the organization controlling the dry-lubricant specifications\nis using the Falex test machine (fig. 18) exclusively in its test work,\nit will be discussed first. A rotating pin is held between two stationary V-blocks in a nutcracker-type loading system (fig. 19). This\ntester gives initial line contact on loading, with eventual area contact as wearing takes place. Although this machine has been used\nmainly in the evaluation of thin-film solid lubricants at room\ntemperature, it has been modified f o r testing at both liquid nitrogen\n\nFIGURE\n18.-Falex lubricant tester.\n\nEVALUATING SOLID LUBRICANTS\n\nd\n\n0\n\nt\n-\n\nt\n-\n\nt\nQ)\n\nrl\n\nm\n\n0.1\n\n0.1\n\nW\n"\n0.1\n\n0\n\n0\n0\n\nY\n\n.

A similar arrangement is\nshown in figure 21, but with diametrically opposed rub shoes. Either\nversion gives initial line contact, with area contact resulting from\nload and wear. These testers are normally employed for evaluating\nresin or ceramic-bonded films.\nLFW-1 .-This machine uses the test configuration shown in\nfigure 22, where a stationary test block is pressed against a rotating\nTimken ring. The rotational speed varies from 12.5 to 197 rpm,\nand the load from 30 to 630 lb. Testing is done at room temperature\nonly, friction being monitored throughout the test period. The machine, which can be operated in both unidirectional and oscillatory\nmotion, gives initial line contact on loading, with area contact resulting from load and wear.

The test shafts are hardened dowel pins chucked\nin two precision collets that are mounted in pillow blocks. The test\njournal is the ball of a standard %-in. diam spherical bearing (fig.\n42), the spherical surface of which is used only for initial alignment and is not lubricated. The replacement of the journal bearing\nis facilitated by using a loader-slot spherical bearing seat. The load\nis applied to the journal by a 5-in. bore pneumatic cylinder (fig. 43)\nthrough a hanger in which the spherical bearing seat is mounted.\nRegulated bottled gas is used to control the load on the journal\nbearing and the load hanger is instrumented with semiconductor\nstrain gauges for the measurement of both load and torque (fig. 44).\nThe test shaft is driven through one of the collets by a n SCR-controlled de motor with an integral gear reducer, shaft speeds being\nadjustable from 5 to 125 rpm. Modified versions of these journalbearing testers are operated at speeds up to 3600 rpm. Wear-life of\nthe journal bearing is measured by a running-time meter on the\nmotor controller, and the torque, sensed by the strain gauges, is\nindicated on a meter relay and registered on an external recorder\n(fig.43). The meter relay will turn off the drive motor when a preset\ntorque is exceeded.\n\nEVALUATING SOLID LUBRICANTS\n\n-\n\n61\n\nL O A D JACK\n\nN O R M A L LOAD CELL\nDRIVE\nJACK\nSPECIMEN\nPLATES\n\nDRIVE\nMOTOR\n\nFRAME\'\nFIGURE\n39.-NASA\n\nhigh-load tester configuration.\n\nLFW-5 journal-bearing tester.-The\nLFW-5 journal-bearing\ntester (fig. 45) uses the standard test shaft and bushing shown in\nfigure 46.

The contact area is adjustable 0.1 to 1.0 sq in. and\ncontact stresses can be varied from 150 to 15 000 psi.

The running time is\nindicated automatically.\nAlthough many testers are available for the evaluation of bonded\nsolid lubricants, the results from any one tester cannot necessarily\nbe taken as the absolute answer. To demonstrate the point more\nclearly, an analysis of contact stresses found in three of the most\nwidely used machines is included as appendix B. It is suggested\nthat the above analysis be studied thoroughly before deciding on a\nparticular test configuration.\n\nCHAPTER 6\nI\n\nI\nI\n\nEffects of Environments on Solid Lubricants\nSolid-lubricant materials are generally selected for use because\nof their resistance to environmental conditions that conventional oil\nand grease cannot tolerate. Other advantages solid lubricants have\nover conventional lubricants include (1)lubrication for the life of\nthe part, (2) essentially dry lubrication, (3) lubrication of parts of\ncomponents that are difficult to reach, (4) lubrication where the\npresence of vapors from fluid or grease lubricants is unacceptable,\nand ( 5 ) no attraction for dust or dirt.\nEnvironmental conditions can strongly influence the performance\nof solid lubricants. Friction and wear characteristics may vary from\none machine element to another using the same lubricant. The\nreader, however, is cautioned that most solid-lubricant data are\nbased on laboratory and bench tests and that such values do not\nnecessarily correlate directly with those obtained from operational\nexperience. Therefore, the data should be considered only as guides.\nIt is strongly suggested that those interested in using solid lubricants should conduct evaluation tests on equipment known to correlate with their particular requirement. If this type of testing had\nbeen conducted in the early days of dry-film lubricants, many\nmisapplications would have been avoided. Excessive reliance on\nmanufacturers\' bench-test data has resulted in severe criticism and\na general distrust of all solid lubricants. A solid lubricant, more\nthan other lubricants, requires careful consideration of the operating conditions to which it is subjected.\nEFFECTS OF NORMAL ATMOSPHERE\n\nFrom the research presently being conducted and the volumes of\nliterature available on solid lubricants, it appears that very little\nwork has been done on solid lubricants under the more conventional\nconditions-normal air environment a t temperatures in the range\nof -65" to +200\xc2\xb0 F. On the other hand, nearly all research reported\nis for very specific conditions. Apparently, the feeling has been that\nsince there are specifications covering the solid lubricants at normal\nconditions, there is no need for further work in the area. Formerly,\nno attempt was made to arrange the known characteristics of solid\n\n67\n\n68\n\nSOLID LUBRICANTS\n\nlubricants in normal air atmosphere into a usable document for\ndesigners.\nIn the normal atmosphere, the solid lubricants come into contact\nwith such contaminants as dust, dirt, water vapor, salt water, oil,\nand other lubricants, all of which adversely affect their usefulness.\nWater vapor or humidity is a good example of these contaminants.\nSeveral investigators have shown that water vapor causes molybdenum disulfide solid lubricants to have higher coefficients of friction, while the reverse is true of graphite which depends on a\ncertain amount of moisture to permit it to act as a lubricant.\nWater vapor can also cause other problems, the major one being\ncorrosion. The thin-film bonded lubricants of the resin-, nonceramic-, and ceramic-bonded types are all susceptible to damage from\nsubstrate corrosion. Water can enter the pores and react with the\nbase material o r substrate, forming rust or other corrosion products. The situation is further aggravated by the presence of a salt\nsolution. Researchers a t the U.S.Army Rock Island Arsenal (refs.\n76 and 77) have conducted extensive corrosion studies on resinbonded solid lubricants. They found that up to 50 percent (area\ncoverage) corrosion has little effect on wear-life, but that complete\nrust coverage reduces the wear-life otherwise expected to approximately one-half. They also found that conventional lubricants are\nharmful to the wear-life of a bonded solid-film lubricant.\nThe MRI group has conducted a corrosion study using the MLF-9\nlubricant mentioned in chapter 3. The combination of metal chromates with MLF-9 improved its corrosion resistance. Overcoating\nthe lubricant with the resin-bonded Teflon material, however, provided much more corrosion protection.\nThe problem of corrosion encountered when using solid lubricants has been investigated by several other researchers (refs. 78\nand 79). It has also been observed (ref. 80) that the use of cadmium\nplate in conjunction with a bonded solid lubricant reduces the wearlife of the film a s much as 40 percent. The use of the above lubricantplating combination at loads above 1000 psi is not recommended.\nMansur (ref. 81) conducted a corrosion study in which he evaluated five common lubricant films on aluminum surfaces that were\nexposed to humidity and salt fog. The evaluated films were (1)MoS,\nand graphite in an air-drying organic binder, (2) MoS, and graphite\nin a quick drying inorganic binder, (3) MoS, and graphite conforming to MILL-8937, (4)MoS, in heat-cured phenolic binder, and\n( 5 ) fluorocarbon-PTFE in a heat-cured resin binder. He reports that\nsevere corrosion occurred with the air-drying and quick air-drying\nMoS, and graphite films. Moderate corrosion occurred with the\nheat-cured MoS, and graphite films, and no corrosion was observed\n\nEFFECTS ON ENVIRONMENTS\n\n69\n\nwith the heat-cured MoS, or fluorocarbon-type films. Mansur concluded that films containing graphite should not be used on highstrength aluminum alloys.\nBecause bonded solid lubricants do not provide corrosion protection and may possibly cause corrosion under certain conditions, a\nchemical treatment or plating should be applied prior to the application of the lubricant.\nIt appears that thin bonded films of the lubricating plastics, such\na s Teflon, do protect against corrosion, mainly because they are not\nnearly so porous as are the MoS,-graphite films.\nFrom conversations with many experts in the solid-lubricant field,\nit seems that there has been considerable difficulty with certain nonceramic (sodium silicate) bonded films when they are used in humid\nconditions or where water is present, the problem being the water\nsolubility of the silicate material. This problem has also been encountered when attempting to test a sodium silicate bonded material\nat liquid nitrogen temperatures. Apparently, the problem of solubility with silicate materials can be overcome by adequate curing a t\nhigher temperatures for longer periods of time.\nEFFECTS O F OTHER THAN NORMAL ATMOSPHERE\n\nSolid lubricants may be required to operate not only in normal\nair atmosphere but in hard vacuum, inert gases, reactive gases,\nand radiation zones. Many of the solid lubricants will not provide\nlubrication in all of these atmospheres, and must be limited for use\nonly in specific atmospheres. Graphite, for instance, does not lubricate well in a vacuum because it relies on the presence of water\nvapor to reduce friction.\nOxidizing atmospheres are usually detrimental to solid lubricants\ncontaining molybdenum disulfides. This is particularly true a s the\ntemperature increases, causing a rapid oxidation of the MoS, to\nMOO,. There are solid-lubricant films, however, that work just the\nopposite, one being a PbO-Pb,O, film developed by Peterson and\nJohnson (refs. 82 and 83).\nThe space program has generated the need for solid lubricants\nto be used in the vacuum of outer space. In this environment, conventional liquid lubricants are not suitable for use on moving components unless elaborate sealing procedures are followed which\nadd unnecessary weight and complexity. Solid lubricants offer one\nof the most promising methods of lubrication for space systems, and\nat present, there are a number of research programs to develop\nand evaluate solid-lubricant film for use in the vacuum region of\nto 10-l1 torr.\n\n70\n\nSOLID LUBRICANTS\n\nA group of materials specifically developed for vacuum operation\nare the MLF materials reported in chapter 3. The lubricating plastics, polytetrafluoroethylene and polyimides, are good lubricants\nfor use in a vacuum. There are other hostile environments where\nsolid lubricants can be considered for use, especially in the handling\nof reactive chemicals and gases ; the use of lubricating plastics is\ngrowing in these areas.\nTEMPERATURE EFFECTS\n\n~\n\nI\n\nThe resistance of various solid lubricants to extreme temperatures has significantly expedited their development. Various types\nof solid lubricants perform well a t temperatures in the cryogenic\nregion and at temperatures up to 1500" F. Conventional petroleumbased materials have upper performance limits of only ZOOo to\n300\' F. Some synthetic fluids have operating ranges from 600" to\n700\' F. At low temperatures, these products are limited to around\n-100" F, with only a few that are fluid below this temperature.\nIn general, the resin-bonded solid lubricants are usable over the\ntemperature range of approximately -100" t o +450\xc2\xb0F, but for\nshort-term operation, they can be used at much higher temperatures. A good example of their use at extreme temperatures is as an\nantiseize material on threads, where very little oxygen is in contact\nwith the material and rapid oxidation of the lubricating solid cannot take place. With the acrylic, phenolic, and epoxy resin-bonded\nfilms, it is not the lubricating solid (pigment) that is the weak part\nof the film but the organic binder which will deteriorate a t temperatures above 450" F.\nThe loss of film integrity a t low temperatures can be attributed\nto brittleness of the resin binder and at elevated temperatures to\ndecomposition of the resin binder. At both extremes, film adhesion\nis very poor. The loss is much more exaggerated when the films are\nsubjected to high loads at either low or high temperatures. The\nestablished adhesion tests described in the specifications listed in\nappendix A are not applicable to these conditions, since they are\nnot conducted on parts that have been subjected to high loads a t the\nspecified temperatures.\nThe inorganic-bonded films (MoS,-graphite-sodium silicate) are\ndesigned for operation over a wider extreme of temperature than\nare the resin-bonded materials. They are reported to be usable from\n-300\' to +750\xc2\xb0 F in air and to over 1200" F in vacuum (ref. 29).\nWith these films, the lubricating solid (MoS,) is limited in use for\ncontinuous operation above 750" F, because it rapidly oxidizes to\n\nMOO,.\n\nEFFECTS ON ENVIRONMENTS\n\n71\n\nAn interesting observation made by Hopkins (ref. 30) is that the\nfriction of the sodium silicate-bonded solid lubricants decreases\n5\'\nwith increase in temperature up to about 3 0 F and then begins to\nincrease slightly. Another very desirable characteristic of these\nfilms is their compatibility with liquid oxygen, which makes them\nprime candidates for use on space vehicles.\nThe ceramic-bonded films (CaF,-ceramic binder) are designed for\nuse in the temperature range of 1000" to 1500\' F, although they\nhave been shown to be usable a t much lower temperatures (as discussed in chapter 3). At ambient temperatures below 700\xc2\xb0 F , these\nfilms show reduced wear-life and higher friction and, therefore,\nshould not be considered as low-temperature lubricants. However,\nif the ceramic-bonded films are used a t low temperatures (700O F)\nand the surface speed of the mating parts is such that high local\nheating is produced, the ceramic-bonded films work very well. This\ncan probably be attributed to the melting of the binder and lubricant, forming a very thin liquid lubricant film.\nAll the lubricating plastics have relatively moderate temperature\nlimits. On the high side, the addition of reinforcing materials to the\nplastics has not raised their useful limits much above 500" F. On\nthe low side, these materials have a disadvantage of increasing friction coefficient with decreasing temperature. One shortcoming of\nthe plastic materials is their low heat-rejection rate. For this reason the surface temperatures encountered can affect the strength\nof these materials. Therefore, when using such materials, the designer must provide an adequate cooling system.\nThe powdered lubricating solids have a broad, useful temperature\nrange. Their performance depends, t o a large extent, on the environmental atmosphere as well a s on the length of time a t operating temperature. Molybdenum disulfide, as mentioned previously, is limited to 750\' F in an air-oxidizing atmosphere, but can be used at\ntemperatures in excess of 1200\' F in a vacuum or when carried in\nnitrogen or argon gas which inhibits oxidation. Other solid lubricants show similar changes in performance depending on the environment, In general, solid-lubricant powders will perform from\nextremely low temperatures to extremely high temperatures, provided no chemical breakdown in their structure occurs.\nRADIATION EFFECTS\n\nSome radiation studies have been conducted on solid lubricants,\nbut they have not been extensive. Consequently, the data available\nare fragmentary.\nFrom the available literature, i t appears that solid lubricants are\n\n72\n\nSOLID LUBRICANTS\n\nmuch more radiation-resistant than oils and greases (refs. 84\nthrough 94). Goetzel (ref. 89) states that the lubricity of molybdenum\ndisulfide is not damaged by radiation. He further reports that although Teflon is damaged to a greater extent in air than any other\nlubricating plastic, i t is much more resistant to radiation when used\nin a vacuum.\nLavik (refs. 87 and 88) conducted wear-life tests on 13 commercial\nsolid lubricants after subjecting them to radiation levels up to lo8\nroentgens (gamma) and 3 ~ 1 nvt ~ ~\n0 (neutron), and found little permanent effect on the lubricating properties of the films. The materials\nwere of the resin- and ceramic-bonded types.\nDaniel (ref. 84) conducted wear-life studies on films composed of\nPbO:B,O, and MoS,:NaO SiO, after a gamma dose of 8 7 8 ~ 1 0 ~\nergs/g (carbon) and found no perceptible change in wear-life. In\nadditional studies, Daniel irradiated graphite in a mixed reactor\nflux to a neutron dosage of 3 . 6 6 ~ 1 0 nvt and found severe lattice\n\'~\ndamage. Molybdenum disulfide, under the same conditions, showed\npractically no change in lattice spacing.\nMcDaniel (ref. 92) conducted wear-life studies a t 80", 600\xc2\xb0 and\n1200\' F, using a Hohman A-6 wear tester (described in chapter 5 )\non five high-temperature solid lubricants after they had been subjected to a radiation dosage of 2 . 2 ~ 1 0 "\nergs/g (carbon) and associated neutrons of 5 . 2 ~ N/cm2. He reports that reactor radiation\nhad no significant effect on the wear-life of lubricant films composed\nMoS, + B,O, or CaF2 ceramic binder. The wear-life of\nof PbS\na film comprised of MoS, -k graphite sodium was decreased at the\n80" F temperature level but improved a t both the 600\' and 1200\' F\nlevels. Additional radiation studies have been conducted at General\nDynamics Corp. (ref. 93).\nHopkins (ref. 30) has tested lubricant MLF-5 (described in chapter 5) in an R-2 size bearing subjected to a gamma dosage of 1Olo\nergs/g (carbon) and 2 ~ 1 0 nvt fast neutrons. In comparison with\n\'~\nthe liquid lubricants evaluated a t the same time, the MLF-5 gave\nthe longest wear-life.\nPinchbeck (ref. 86) has generated radiation-effect data on several\nplastics, including thermosetting nylon resins, polytetrafluoroethylene, and polyethylene.\nDemorest (ref. 94) has compared the wear-lives of six lubricant\nfilms that were not irradiated vs the same films irradiated at 1 MeV\nelectron irradiation of 2 . 8 10l6 electrons/cmz, and gamma irradia~\ntion of 2 x 10IG\nroentgens. A statistical analysis of the wear-life data\nrevealed that only two films were significantly affected by the radiation a t the 90 percent confidence level, and that electron irradiation\nappeared to improve wear-life.\n\n+\n\n+\n\n+\n\nEFFECTS ON ENVIRONMENTS\n\n73\n\nLOAD AND OTHER EFFECTS\n\nThe load under which solid lubricants are to operate is an important consideration. Resin-bonded lubricants can be expected to\ncarry loads of up to 100 000 psi, while the inorganic-bonded type\ncan operate at loads of up to 150 000 psi, as shown by Demorest\n(ref. 95) and Hopkins (ref. 30). In general, the operation of solidlubricated machine elements a t high loads must be a t slow speed.\nIn designing for solid-lubricant films, particularly where high loads\nare anticipated, the designer should always remove sharp edges that\nwill contact the film since they will cut through the soft lubricant\nand plane it from the part.\nLubricating solids, such as MoS, in dry powder form or when\nused with a binder material, exhibit decreasing friction with load,\nas demonstrated by Hopkins (ref. 30), Demorest (ref. 95), and Karpe\n(ref. 96). Figure 60, chapter 9, is a graphic representation of friction vs load for typical solid-lubricant films. Speed and load effects\non typical bonded solid lubricants are presented in figures 61\nthrough 63, chapter 9.\nCompared to other solid lubricants, the lubricating plastics generally perform best under light loads. Some load-carrying benefit\nhas been achieved by the addition of fiber and metal fillers, but even\nthen the loading cannot be excessive. The plastics are best suited\nfor long service under light to moderate load and speed conditions.\nBoth the lubricating plastics and the bonded solid films should\nbe considered for use where dirt contamination is expected because\nthey a r e less affected than conventional lubricants. High-speed\nsliding with all the plastics and thin-film bonded lubricants must be\ncarried out under relatively light loads.\nBonded solid lubricants have not been considered suitable for use\nin antifriction bearings, but some work is now being done with the\nsilicate-bonded films that show good performance. It appears, however, that the use of lubricant composite materials as bearing retainers will be the best method of achieving dry lubrication of antifriction bearings. Vest (ref. 97) reports satisfactory results using\npolytetrafluoroethylene-MoS?, fiberglass-reinforced retainers in\nsmall ball bearings. Bearings were subjected to oscillatory and slowspeed rotating motion under simulated space environment for\nperiods of up to 12 000 hr. The bench tests conducted by Vest seem\nto correlate well with in-service use since many of the weather\nsatellites used by Goddard Space Flight Center are still in operation after several years in space. Rittenhouse (ref. 90) and Clauss\n(ref. 98) have also reported good results using plastic and composite\nbearing retainers.\n\nCHAPTER 7\n\nNovel Application Methods\nOne of the primary problems concerning the use of solid lubricants is the method of application to surfaces to obtain good film\nadhesion. In the past, adhesion of the solid-lubricant films has been\nobtained either by utilizing binders (e.g. thermoplastics, thermosetting resins, or ceramic binders) or by burnishing the substrate\nsurface with the lubricating powders. There are many applications\nwhere the presence of a bonding agent is undesirable or would be a\ndisadvantage ; for example, where the performance of the film may\nbe degraded by environmental effects, particularly those that may\naffect film adherence, such as decomposition of the binder. Another\nexample where the presence of a binder is detrimental is in the\ncoating of close tolerance parts (such as ball bearings) where the\nnormal film thickness of 0.0002 to 0.0005 in. per surface cannot be\ntolerated. Burnished films leave much to be desired with respect to\nbonding the lubricant to the surface, and uniformity of coating.\nThe novel methods of application to be discussed are sputtering,\nin situ processing, electrophoretic deposition, and plasma spraying.\nSPUTTERING\n\nResearchers at the NASA-Lewis Research Center have conducted\nextensive investigations of molybdenum disulfide sputtering. Work\nreported in reference 99 utilized a three-electrode sputtering apparatus consisting of a thermionic cathode, an anode, and the target (fig. 49). The components of the apparatus, which are enclosed\nin a vacuum system, consist o f :\n(1)Thermionic cathode-a spiraled filament of tungsten wire 0.1\nem thick, which, when heated, acts as a thermionic electron source\n(2) Anode-a flat stainless steel disk to which a positive potential\nof about 500 V is applied to establish a glow discharge between it\nand the thermionic cathode\n(3) Target-the material to be deposited, a cylindrically shaped\ncompact of MoS, (1.3 em in diam and about 5 em in length), which is\nmade without a binder by utilizing compacting pressures of 50 000\nto 100 000 psi (34.47~10; 6 8 . 9 4 ~ 1 0 \'N/mz)). The MoS, target is\nto\nheld in a water-cooled holder, in order to keep the target tempera75\n\n76\n\nSOLID LUBRICANTS\n\nFIGURE49.-Triode\ndirectcurrent sputtering apparatus.\n\nture from rising excessively. A negative potential is applied to this\ntarget.\n(4) Specimen-the substrate material placed close to target material on which the atoms ejected from the target are deposited to\nform a continuous film.\nA thermocouple gage monitors the chamber pressure during sputtering, and pure argon is admitted to the vacuum chamber through\na variable leak-control valve.\nSputtering is generally performed in a n argon atmosphere of\nseveral microns pressure. A potential is applied across the electrodes to ionize the gas. The cathode (target) is made of the material\nt o be sputtered from the target, which is ejected through the plasma\naqd deposited as a film on the specimen. The basic mechanism of\nsputtering is thus a process where the positive argon ions, which\nform a gaseous plasma, are accelerated through an electron-free\nregion (Langmuir sheath) with sufficient energy (40 to 60 eV or\n6.4~10-l~ 9 . 6 ~ 1 0 - lJ) to knock off or sputter the negatively\nto\n~\ncharged target material. In explaining the actual sputtering phenomena, present theories (refs. 100 to 102) favor a momentum\nexchange energy-transfer. The sputtered material is deposited on\nthe specimen, which is placed close to the target source. For compounds, such as MoS,, which have a wide disparity in vapor pressure of the constituents, the material can be deposited nearly\nstoichiometrically without thermal dissociation. In this method, the\n\nNOVEL APPLICATION METHODS\n\n77\n\nbasic mechanism is essentially independent of the target temperature, provided the target temperature is below the vaporization or\ndissociation temperature of the target material.\nThe bell j a r is evacuated to a pressure of approximately lo-\' torr\n( 1 . 3 3 ~ 1 0 -N/mz), then purged several times with pure argon\n~\nthrough a variable leak valve. Finally, the system is again evacuated, and argon is introduced a t a controlled rate. A constant prestorr (1.33~10-\'N/m2) is maintained in the bell\nsure of about\njar. A positive potential of about 500 V (relative to the filament) is\napplied to the anode (fig. 49), and the thermionic cathode emitter\n(tungsten filament) is heated to emission temperature causing a\nglow discharge. A negative potential of 2000 to 4000 V is then applied to the specimen (fig. 49), resulting in the attraction of positive\nargon ions from the gas discharge. The impingement of the argon\nions on the surface of the specimen cleans it by sputtering. After\nthe cleaning process has continued for about 20 min, the negative\npotential on the specimen is quickly switched to the target material\n(MoS,). This procedure results in bombardment of the target by the\nargon ions, which are attracted by its negative potential. Molybdenum disulfide is therefore sputtered from the surface of the target\nand subsequently deposited on the previously cleaned specimen. The\nspacing between the target and the specimen is about 4 cm.\nSpalvins et a1 (ref. 99) found that they could produce sputtered\nmolybdenum disulfide films with thicknesses in the range of 2000\nto 3000 A. They report that the significant feature of applying MoS,\nin this manner is the avoidance of dissociation in the lubricant\ncompound. X-ray analyses of the films show that nearly stoichiometric quantities of the lubricant material (MoS,) were obtained.\nFriction values obtained on the sputtered MoS, are from 0.06 to\n0.09 which are in good agreement with values obtained on resinbonded films, 0.03 to 0.09. There is evidence of good bonding between the sputtered films and the metal substrates as indicated by\nlong endurance life (5 hr) of the lubricating films in friction experiments. The sputtered MoS, films have a n accurate repeatability in\nterms of stoichiometry, adherence, thickness, and uniformity when\nthe sputtering conditions a r e kept constant.\nAdditional work on the sputtered films has been done at the Lewis\nResearch Center and reported in references 103 through 106. Reference 104 is of particular interest since sputtered films of molybdenum disulfide were evaluated on a variety of base metals, namely:\ncopper, silver, beryllium, gold, rhodium, and palladium. Przybyszewski and Spalvins report (ref. 104) that the sputtered films of\nMoS, are not useful for the lubrication of copper surfaces. Notwithstanding, they can be successfully employed for lubricating sur-\n\n78\n\nSOLID LUBRICANTS\n\nfaces of silver, beryllium, gold, rhodium, and palladium. Their data\nshow that the sputtered films of MoS, were effective lubricants for\nthe selected materials, but because of the excessive and erratic contact resistance displayed by all material combinations, the films of\nMoS, should be used only in mechanical applications and not in\nelectric contacts. The possible exception is silver, which has an\naverage contact resistance of 0.016 ohm. This low value of contact\nresistance was caused by the excessive metal-to-metal contact which\noccurred in this combination of metals.\nSome improvements in the electrical performance of the sputtered\nfilms of MoS, might be obtained by sputtering silver, or some other\nsuitable material, simultaneously with MoS,.\nMidwest Research Institute and other organizations (refs. 99\nthrough 107) have conducted sputtering experiments. In work\nconducted a t MRI and reported in reference 107, Falex test specimens were coated with sputtered MoS, films and evaluated under\nstandard test conditions at a 1000-lb jaw load in accordance with\nreference 137C. Wear-lives of over 90 min were obtained, the magnitude of which compares quite favorably with those obtained on\nmany resin-bonded films conforming to such specifications as MILL-8937 and MIL-L-46010, described in appendix A. The work conducted at MRI also indicates that it is possible to sputter other\nsolid lubricants, namely, calcium fluoride.\nIt appears that the physical dc sputtering method of applying\nlubricating solids to metal substrates is practical, particularly in\nareas where only extremely thin films can be tolerated such as closetolerance bearings (antifriction, ball, and roller). To date, however,\nvery little actual evaluation has been done on sputtered films in\nbearing applications. One reason for this lack of test data is the\nfact that films could not be sputtered on curved or irregular surfaces without elaborate means of turning the specimens inside the\nvacuum system during the sputtering process. During a visit to the\nLewis Research Center, the author was informed by those engaged\nin the sputtering program that they have devised a method of\ndepositing the lubricant material evenly on all surfaces of the part\nbeing coated. If they, in fact, are able to coat evenly in all directions,\nthis method certainly will be a major step in the use of the sputtered\nfilms.\nIN SITU PROCESS\n\nA solid-lubricant film can be formed on metal surfaces from the\nsurrounding atmosphere through the use of reactive or film-forming\ngases. Vest (ref. 108) has discussed a method of depositing a n MoS,\nlubricating film by first electrodepositing a coating of MOO,, and\n\nNOVEL APPLICATION METHODS\n\nI\n\n79\n\nthen subjecting the coated part to H,S gas at elevated temperature\nand pressure. The process results in the formation of a complex\nmolybdenum disulfide crystalline structure that incorporates the\nmetal substrate at the treated surface. Film thickness can be controlled accurately by this process; for instance, a coating thickness of from 0.00005 to 0.0005 in. can be successfully applied uniformly. A commercial process identified as E3C* by its processor is\navailable. Vest and the processor (ref. 109) both report that the\nmaterial can be applied to stainless steels 303, 304, 316, 416, and\n440C; aluminum alloys 2024, 6061, and 7075; and to both mild\nsteel and M-10 tool steel. The processor (ref. 109) further states\nthat all conductive metals can be successfully processed without\ndifficulty except copper and its alloys, which do not coat satisfactorily. Vest further reports that the coefficient of friction of the\nin situ film is 0.025 to 0.05 and that film wear is much better than\nthe inorganic-bonded molybdenum disulfide films. He has also successfully applied the in situ films to instrument bearing races,\nretainers, and small gears.\nThe processor of the E3C process gives (ref. 109) several design\nfactors that must be followed when considering the process for use\non bearing parts: (1) the base material must withstand temperatures of 350" F for up to 3 hr without damage, (2) covered or concealed areas cannot be properly coated, (3) the process makes it\ndifficult to mask portions of the surface where coating is not desired, and (4) finely ground or polished surfaces require special pretreatment. When properly applied, the material has excellent film\nadhesion and gives test wear-lives equal to or better than conventional baked-on bonded solid lubricants.\nELECTROPHORETIC DEPOSITION\n\nCoating by electrophoresis, in which small suspended particles\nare deposited on an electrode with the aid of an electrostatic field, is\nwell known. The process is most widely used in biological applications as an accurate analytical tool to separate the components of\nsolutions. Electrophoretic deposition has been used for many years\nby the radio-tube industry in coating delicate tube parts and by the\nrubber industry in producing rubber gloves.\nA solid lubricant, such as MoS,, can also be applied by electrophoresis. The lubricant can be applied by itself or with a binding\nagent. The carrier solvent used in the process should be of the organic type with a high dielectric value, such as acetone and alcohol.\n\n* E3C Process-Proprietary\n\nprocess of Dow Corning Corp.\n\n80\n\nSOLID LUBRICANTS\n\nThe lubricating solid is placed in the solvent and agitated, because\na good suspension is imperative for the process to work. There are a\nnumber of ways that the quality of the suspension can be improved,\namong which are (1) the use of a finely divided lubricating material\n(0.5 p or less) and (2) the addition of a protein material (zein) which\nwill help form a colloidal suspension. When a good suspension is\nobtained, the part to be coated is placed in the solution and used as\none of the electrodes. A second electrode is connected and a highvoltage charge is passed through the solution for a controlled\nperiod of time, causing the lubricant particles to migrate through\nthe solution and coat the test part. Parts are then removed from the\nsolution and dried or fired prior to use. A schematic illustration of\na typical electrophoretic setup is shown in figure 50.\nThe electrophoretic process has been employed by a number of\ninvestigators (refs. 110 through 114). The Vitro Laboratories of\nthe Vitro Corp. of America have done considerable research in this\nfield and have obtained a number of U.S.\npatents (refs. 115 and 116)\non the process. In general, MoS, is co-deposited with a metal oxide.\nThe metal oxide is then reduced in a hydrogen furnace and the\nmetal becomes the binder for the lubricant (MoS,) in the coating.\nThe advantages of this method of coating include: good reproducibility of coating thickness, rapid coating application, and good\ncoating uniformity. Of these advantages, coating uniformity is\nespecially significant with complex shapes such a s gears. Coating\nuniformity is obtained by means of the electric insulating properties\nof the applied coat. As some of the particles migrate to the attracting electrode and deposit, they partially insulate that portion of the\nsurface. The particles then approaching the electrode move to the\nuninsulated portion, thus building up a uniform coating.\nBEARING,\n\nt-\n\nFIGURE\n50.-Setup for applying solid-lubricant films electrophoretically.\n\nSUSPENSION\n(SOLID LUBRICANT EL LIQUID)\n\nNOVEL APPLICATION METHODS\n\n81\n\nMcConnell et a1 (ref. 117) report the use of the electrophoretic\nprocess to overcoat a ceramic-bonded solid lubricant with a film of\nmolybdenum disulfide. Their intent was to fill the voids of the porous\nceramic-bonded films with the electrophoretically deposited film and\nthus increase the film\xe2\x80\x99s useful wear-life. They report a substantial\nincrease in the wear-life of their original ceramic film and state\nthat no increase in film thickness was found. It therefore appears\nthat they accomplished the original intent of the overcoating, that\nis, to fill the void areas with extra lubricant.\nAlthough the application of solid lubricants by the electrophoretic\nprocess has shown some promise, i t has not yet become a commercial\nreality.\nPLASMA-SPRAY PROCESS\n\nAlthough the techniques of plasma and flame spraying are not\nnew, their use in applying solid lubricants has not been thoroughly\nexplored. The plasma-spray process, a unique method for the application of a wide variety of solid-film lubricants, has several advantages over conventional ones. Plasma-applied films require\nneither organic solvents nor water suspensions and, therefore, require no bakeout. Probably the most important feature of the flamespraying process is the ability to apply such coatings as ceramics to\nmetal substrates without affecting the hardness of the substrate\nmaterial. Normally, ceramic materials are prepared from frits and\napplied on a surface by firing at extremely high temperatures. These\ntemperatures are often above the heat-treatment temperature of the\nbase material, and thus may affect its mechanical properties. As\nstated above, the flame-spraying process eliminates this problem.\nLubricants that have been applied by this process range from plastic\nto metal and ceramic binders combined with solid lubricants, such\nas molybdenum and tungsten disulfides and graphite.\nTwo processes appear useful for applying solid lubricants by\nflame-spray or plasma-stream techniques : (1) application of a\nporous ceramic coating followed by burnishing a solid lubricant\nonto the surface and into the porous structure; and (2) application\nof a mixture of a binder and lubricant powder simultaneously. The\nlatter process eliminates the curing step. The second process, however, has some shortcomings, particularly that some of the lubricant powder is altered by the heat required for spraying, resulting\nin films that are overrich in binder ; either ceramic or metal binders\ncan be used.\nHopkins et a1 (ref. 118) conducted a feasibility study of applying\nsolid lubricant films with a plasma gun. The gun configurations\nused to apply metals, resins, ceramics, and solid lubricant (graphite,\n\n82\n\nSOLID LUBRICANTS\n\nWS,, and MoS,) films are described. The importance of the spraygun configuration in avoiding lubricant degradation and/or dissociation as well as in obtaining good binder fusion is delineated. Their\nfindings were : (1)a dual-port entry gun, which introduced binders\nin the hot zone and lubricant powders in a cool zone, was the best\nfor the application of ceramic-bonded MoS2 films ; and (2) the film\nadhesion, load-carrying capacity, wear-life, and other properties of\nplasma-sprayed lubricants were not as good as those of lubricants\napplied by conventional methods.\nKremith et a1 (ref. 119) also experimented with plasma-sprayed\nsolid-lubricant films. Kremith used as his lubricant powders composite materials of copper, nickel, and silver with molybdenum disulfide. In his opinion, a composite powder provided some protection for the lubricant phase and it also decreased material segregation during the spray operation. Hopkins (ref. 118) mentions that\nat least one organization in the U.S. now uses a plasma-spray process in applying conventional bonded solid lubricants.\nIt has been demonstrated (refs. 118 and 119) that the possibility\nof lubricant degradation or dissociation does exist when using the\nplasma spray to apply the conventional lubricating solids such a s\nMoS,, WS,, and graphite. Therefore, it is the author\xe2\x80\x99s opinion that\nthe higher-temperature lubricant powders such as CaF,, SrF,, and\nBaF, should be used in the plasma-spray process rather than MoS,\nand WS,.\n\nCHAPTER 8\n\nPresent Applications for Solid Lubricants\nKnowledge of the use of solid lubricants by governmental agen,\ncies (NASA and DOD*) aerospace and commercial industries, as\nwell as information obtained from literature searches indicates that\nthe use of all forms of solid lubricants is increasing. The general\nacceptance of solid lubricants has been rather slow, but within the\nlast several years their potential has been more fully realized.\nThis chapter discusses a few areas in which solid lubricants have\nbeen used successfully. I t is hoped that the reader who is not familiar with the subject will be able to relate some of the examples\nto his own particular lubrication problems.\nAEROSPACE A N D MILITARY APPLICATIONS\n\nAll types of solid lubricants are used in the aircraft industry on\nboth military and commercial aircraft, a s well as in missiles and\nspace vehicles. The use of solid lubricants in this industry has been\nexpedited by the need for lubrication under extreme environmental\nconditions.\nThe use of solid lubricants for military aircraft has increased\nsteadily over the years from only a few applications on the early\n1900\xe2\x80\x99s fighter planes to over 1000 applications on the North American Rockwell XB-70. Approximately 95 percent of the plain bearings on the XB-70 were either of the lubricating-plastic or thinfilm-ceramic solid-lubricant variety. The North American Rockwell\nCorp. has made extensive use of its own developed ceramic-bonded\nlubricant material, \xe2\x80\x9cVitrolube,\xe2\x80\x9d which has been shown to be a good\nlubricant from room temperature up to 700\xe2\x80\x9d F. The uses of this\nmaterial are generally on bearings of the plain bushing or plain\nspherical type. Many aircraft applications are on such safety devices as ejection seat parts, canopy linkage, and control lever components, where movement is limited, but where the mechanism must\nwork when needed.\nMany reports exist describing applications of solid lubricants in\nmissiles, satellites, and spacecraft. A large number of these appli-\n\n* DOD-Department\n\nof Defense.\n\n83\n\n84\n\nSOLID LUBRICANTS\n\ncations are of the plastic-bearing variety. Goetzel et a1 (ref. 89) and\nClauss (ref. 98) report that a wide variety of materials have been\nevaluated a t the Lockheed Missiles and Space Co. (now Lockheed\nAircraft Corp.) for use in space applications.\nVest and Evans at the Goddard Space Flight Center indicate that\nnearly all of their work in the lubrication of unmanned satellites\nis directed toward the use of solid lubricants. They have been primarily interested in lubricating small ball bearings and have been\nevaluating plastic materials. It is interesting to note that several\nof the satellites under the jurisdiction of the Goddard Space Flight\nCenter have been in orbit for many years and that simulated testing\nof bearings has correlated well with actual use in satellites.\nMidwest Research Institute has developed several lubricant coatings that are used in launch and space vehicles. Typical applications are : gimbal bearings, tie-down clamps, camera parts, gears\nand bearings, sliding tracks, and valves.\nThe U.S.Army also uses large quantities of solid lubricants in\nvarious forms on weapons and ground-handling equipment. Meade\nand Murphy (ref. 76) list over 40 such applications, including :\nBall sockets\nSliding covers\nHandwheels\nBearing-support points\nSlide dust covers\nHand brakes\nChain and sprocket drives\nPlungers\nScrew threads\nTelescoping-tube assemblies\nWarhead-mating fixtures\n\nTrailerselevating mechanisms\ntorsion bar suspensions\nbearing areas\nRifle mounts\nRocket launchers\nAmmunition\nFiring mechanisms\nBreech mechanisms\nTrunnion bearings\n\nSome work is also being done by the Army on the lubrication of\nhelicopter gear boxes with solids in the form of composite gears\nand composites as cage materials in antifriction bearings. The application in helicopters has not been to replace the oil-lubricated\nsystem now in use but as a backup system that will allow the aircraft\nto return to earth if fluid lubrication is lost.\nThe U.S.Navy is also a large user of solid lubricants for aircraft\nand ships. Personnel of the Naval Air Engineering Center state\nthat the Navy uses in excess of 100 000 lb/year of greases containing molybdenum disulfide. This Center is a leader in the development, evaluation, and usage of the solid-lubricant materials. The\nCenter also has the responsibility for maintaining several of the\nmilitary specifications covering solid-lubricant films.\nThe consensus of the military agencies and aerospace industries\n\nPRESENT APPLICATIONS\n\n85\n\ncontacted during this survey indicates that use of these materials\nis increasing and will continue t o increase.\nI\n\nCOMMERCIAL APPLICATIONS\n\nThere is a very large market in the commercial field for solid\nlubricants, including such industries as automotive, heavy electrical,\nmetal-working, marine, household-appliance, toy, f arm-machinery,\nand solid-waste disposal. It is not the intent of the author to include\nevery application, but only to alert readers to the possibility of\nusing solid lubricants in their own work.

Guidelines that can help the user obtain the\nbest results with thin-film bonded solid lubricants are also discussed.\nPerformance, especially durability, of these solid-lubricant films, is\naffected by (1)compatibility, (2) substrate hardness and pretreatment, (3) bearing clearance and film thickness, (4)\nwear debris, and\n( 5 ) effects of load, speed, and temperature.\nCOMPATIBILITY CONSIDERATIONS\n\nWhen bonded solid-lubricant films are used, their compatibility\nwith the environment must be considered, for example, the use in the\npresence of liquid oxygen (LOX). Compatibility with LOX is of such\nimportance that all materials used which might come into contact\nwith it must first pass the compatibility test explained in reference\n120. The normal resin-bonded (phenolic, epoxy, and polyimide) solidlubricant films are not LOX-compatible and should never be used in\nliquid oxygen or high concentrations of gaseous oxygen because the\nslightest impact can cause an explosion. Only the inorganic- and\nceramic-bonded films have been shown to be LOX-compatible. If\nthere is a question of a material being compatible with liquid oxygen,\nthe user should refer to reference 121.\nThe use of ethylene oxide to sterilize for medicinal purposes when\ni t is not feasible to heat-sterilize is another example in which compatibility with the environment must be considered. Constituents in\nbonded solid-lubricant films such as antimony trioxide may react\nchemically with ethylene oxide to cause deterioration in the structural properties of the film which, in turn, shortens the wear-life of\nthe film.\nOils and greases and, in fact, most liquids are very harmful to\nmost bonded solid-lubricant films, and extreme care should be taken\nto prevent the contamination of these films under operating conditions. Tables XI11 and XIV contain data obtained at Midwest Research Institute showing how oil and grease contamination drastically reduces load-carrying capacity and wear-life. This liquid\ncontamination can affect the bonded lubricant films in three ways :\n\n87\n\n88\n\nSOLID LUBRICANTS\n\nTABLE\nXII1.-Falex\n\nLubricant designation\n\nLoad-Carrying Capucity Tests\nLoad-carrying\ncapacity in lb.\nJ a w load in a i r\n\nAir-cured film conforming\nto MIL-L-23389\nHeat-cured phenolic\nbonded film conforming\nto M I L L 8 9 3 7\nHeat-cured phenolic\nbonded film conforming\nto MIL-L-8937\nSodium silicate binder\nHigh-temperature polyimide\nbinder\n\nLoad-carrying\ncapacity in lb.

If the bonded films are inadvertently\ncontaminated with oils o r greases, they can be cleaned with a suitable volatile solvent and restored to a usable condition with little loss\nof wear properties. Contamination in the form of grit should also\n\nDESIGNING FOR USE OF SOLID LUBRICANTS\n\n\'\n\n89\n\nbe avoided when using bonded lubricant films because hard particles\nwill become imbedded in the surface and scratch the relatively soft\nfilm.\nEFFECTS OF SUBSTRATE A N D MATING-SURFACE CONDITIONS\n\nMachine designers or users of bonded lubricant films should\nunderstand that the bond between the substrate surface and the\nlubricant film is primarily one of mechanical adherence. Therefore,\nsurfaces to be coated with a bonded lubricant film must be pretreated prior to receiving the film. Pretreatments usually involve\nroughening of the surface by either wet- or dry-grit blasting. Sometimes chemical treatments, such as phosphating or anodizing, are\nused. In general, pretreatment increases the interfacial surface area\nand enhances interlocking between the lubricant film and substrate.\nThese pretreatments will effectively improve the durability of\nbonded solid-lubricant films, but there is frequently a wide variation\nin the quality of these pretreatments, particularly the chemical\nones. Wet- or dry-grit blasting produces the most uniform and reproducible pretreatment of substrates for solid lubricants. Blast\npressure, blast distance, and quality (sharpness and hardness) of\nblast media are easily controlled. Chemical treatments are done in a\nliquid bath which requires constant scrutiny to insure the proper\nchemical mix, reaction speeds of which can vary from one substrate\nmaterial t o the next. The chemical treatments must also be compatible with the substrate material with which they are used, for example, some anodizing processes will weaken certain aluminum\nalloys.\nChemical pretreatments and platings are generally used on substrates for bonded solid-lubricant films if there is a requirement for\ncorrosion protection, because the bonded lubricants do not provide\nprotection from corrosion when surfaces to be coated are not pretreated.\nAt times the user must consider a pretreatment other than those\nmost favorable for long film durability ; consequently, i t is desirable\nto know the effect these pretreatments have on film wear-life so that\nthe best compromise with the imposed restrictions can be selected.\nIn general, bondced solid-lubricant films applied to hard surfaces\nlast longer than those applied to soft surfaces. This fact has been\ndemonstrated in laboratory tests for both heavy and light loads\n(refs. 16 and 18), as well as in service. Effects of substrate hardness\nhave been investigated under light-load conditions a t Midwest Research Institute (ref. 23). In many applications only one of the two\nsurfaces in a bearing is coated; therefore, the effect of hardness and\n\n90\n\nSOLID LUBRICANTS\n\nroughness of the uncoated surface on the wear-life of a solid-lubricant film needs to be known. Such a n investigation was conducted by\nGaddis and Hopkins (ref. 18). In this study, a solid-lubricant film\n(MLF-5) for the Marshall Space Flight Center (ref. 23) was applied\nto the end of pellets (%-in. diam steel pins) that were slid over a\nwear plate of selected hardness and roughness. Two levels of substrate and mating-surface hardness and several levels of matingsurface finish were used. Sufficient tests were run to permit the data\nto be analyzed statistically, and the results are shown graphically in\nfigure 51.\nThe combination of hardened pellets on hardened wear plates appears to be the best selection of a substrate and mating-surface combination under the conditions of the MRI investigation. Hardened\npellets coated with MLF-5 and rubbed against a hardened wear\nplate having a surface finish of 2 to 4 p in. rrns provided the longest\nwear-life. Longer average wear-lives were obtained with hardened\nwear plates than with annealed wear plates. With the exception of\nhardened pellets on annealed wear plates, the recommended surface\nfinish for the longest wear-life is between 2 and 4 p in. rms. Considering all hardness combinations, it appears that the mating-surface\nroughness should not exceed 5 p in. rms or be less than 1 p in. rms.\nThe work just described is for one particular solid-lubricant film,\nand the conditions (substrate hardness, mating-surface hardness,\nand mating-surface finish) found to be the best for long wear-life\nmay not be the same for other films. In addition, the effect of varying\nthe substrate and mating-surface material, test load, test temperature, sliding speed, and contact configuration were not determined.\nWith the lack of more definitive information, however, these results\nconstitute the best guide for selecting substrate hardness and\nmating-surface hardness and finish.\nBEARING CLEARANCE A N D FILM THICKNESS\n\nThe thickness of bonded solid-film lubricants is much greater\nthan a lubricating film of oil or grease. Consequently, sufficient\nclearance must be allowed in the bearing design to accommodate the\nbonded film. The recommended thickness f o r most solid lubricant\nfilms is about 0.0005 in. per surface. The thickness of lubricant\nmaterial that will provide the most durable film, however, will vary\nfrom film to film and from application to application.\nNumerous investigators have studied the effect of film thickness\non the wear-lives of bonded solid lubricants, oft,en reporting contradictory results. Recently, Jones (ref. 122) found that wear-life was\ndirectly proportional to the square root of the thickness of the lubri-\n\n91\n\nDESIGNING FOR USE OF SOLID LUBRICANTS\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nANNEALED PELLETS\n\nI\n\nI\n\nVS\n\n1\n\nI\n\nI\n\nt\n\nANNEALED WEAR-PLATES\n\n2-3\n3-4\n5-6\n7- 8\n9-10\n\n-\n\nANNEALED PELLETS vs HARDENED WEAR-PLATES\nUJ\n\nI\n\n2-3\n\ncn\nUJ\n\n3-4\n\n4-5\n\nr\n\n5-6\n\na\nW\n\n(3\n\n3\n\nI\n\nI\n\nv\n\n7-8\n\n0\n\na\n\n-\n\na\n\nLL\n\nHARDENED PELLETS vs ANNEALED WEAR-PLATES\n\na\n\n3\n\nU\nJ\n\nW\n\nt\nA\n\n&\n\n&\n\na\n\n1-2\n2-4\n3- 5\n4-6\n6-8\n\nm\n\nww\n\n4\n\nHARDENED PELLETS vs HARDENED WEAR-PLATES\n1-2\n2-4\n3- 5\n4-6\n6 -8\n8-10\nI\nI\n\nI\n\nIO\n\nI\n\nI\n\n20\n\nI\n\nI\n\n30\n\nI\n\nI\n\n1\n\n40\n\nI\n\n50\n\nLOGARITHMIC MEAN AVERAGE WEAR-LIFE\nAND 95% CONFIDENCE LIMITS, HOURS\n\nFIGURE\n51.-Comparison of effects of substrate hardness, mating-surface hardness, and surface finish on the wear-life of MLF-5 lubricant.\n\n92\n\nSOLID LUBRICANTS\n\ncant coating. His work was conducted on a phenolic bonded film\nusing a modified LFW-1 test machine in an oscillatory configuration.\nRabinowicz (ref. 123) investigated the effect of film thickness using\na pin-on-disk machine and reported that total wear-life increased\nwith film thicknesses. Hopkins (ref. 30) has reported similar results\nwith a three-pellet apparatus running under light loads.\nThe author has conducted an extensive investigation of the filmthickness effect using three different test configurations (figs. 52,\n53, and 54), widely used in solid-lubricant film research and development. The lubricant used in this evaluation was a polyimide-resin\nRUB SHOE\n\nFIGURE 52.-Hohman\ndual\nrub-shoe test configuration.\n\nLOAD\n\nFIGURE\n53.-Falex test configuration.\n\nFIGURE\n54.-Pin-on-disk\nconfiguration.\n\ntest\n\n93\n\nDESIGNING FOR USE OF SOLID LUBRICANTS\n\nbonded material composed of molybdenum disulfide and antimony\ntrioxide (MLR-2). The lubricant was developed at Midwest Research\nInstitute for the Marshall Space Flight Center. This particular film\nhas good homogeneity and shows good repeatability in wear-life\ntests. Substantial differences in wear-life vs film thickness resulted\nfrom the three test configurations. The high-load configuration in\nfigure 53 showed the longest wear-life at film thickness between\n0.0002 and 0.0003 in. per surface. The intermediate load configuration, figure 52, showed the longest wear-life at film thickness between 0.0003 and 0.0004 in., whereas the lightly loaded configuration, figure 54, indicated an increase in film life with increasing film\nthickness. Results of these tests are shown graphically in figures\n55, 56, and 57. It is uneconomical to apply film much thicker than\n0.001 in. per surface. In addition, the designer-user must remember\nthat a thicker film will result in a substantially larger amount of\ntroublesome wear debris.\nWear-life of the bonded solid-film lubricants is generally extended\nby coating both parts in any mating combination. A statistically designed program has been conducted at MRI to determine which\nparts in a bearing combination should be lubricated.

As they are worn away during use, the wear products,\nin most cases, should be removed from the mechanism. The texture and porosity of the lubricant films will vary from one to another. Some materials appear fluffy when viewed under a microscope while others look quite dense. When subjected to a load, cured\nsolid-lubricant films can compact from 10 to 30 percent. The fluffy\nlooking films experience the greatest compacting and produce the\nmost wear debris during initial use. This debris usually increases\nthe rate at which additional wear debris is generated. The effect\nof wear debris on film durability is most severe when the film contains hard particles of metals, oxides, silicates, ceramics, or the like.\nSuch particles often come from the binder which accounts for about\n20 percent of the volume of the film.\nWear debris is generated by the sliding action of a sharp edge in\n\n96\n\nSOLID LUBRICANTS\n\ncontact with the surface of a bonded film on a bearing surface. Such\nsharp edges result in a cutting action, shearing the film from the\nsubstrate, A rolling contact over a sharp edge on a coated surface\ntends to chip the film from the surface and, in many cases, starts\na failure point. Film contact with sharp edges should always be\navoided. This can usually be done simply by including a note on\ndrawings to break all sharp edges. The generation of normal wear\ndebris in an oscillatory-sliding operation is shown in figure 58.\nSome provisions must be made for the removal of wear debris\nduring both the initial run-in period of the film and during the entire\nusable life of the lubricant. Run-in wear debris can often be blown\nor brushed out of an assembly after the initial operation. Methods\nof handling the wear debris need to be considered during the design\nof the parts to be coated. In some instances, cavities could be added\nin the surface to collect debris. The benefits of such cavities have\nbeen substantiated by tests conducted at MRI and by discussions\nwith investigators in other laboratories. In assemblies, it may be\nnecessary to provide shielding of certain machine elements from\nthe wear debris generated in other parts, particularly if some moving elements are located below and in line with the areas where\nwear-debris generation is expected. Past experience has shown that\nwear particles generated from lubricant films have caused bearings\nto jam in certain operations.\n\nr-\n\n.a\'-\n\nm-\n\n\' &\n\nb\n\nc\n\nFIGURE\n58.-Generation of wear debris.\n\n?\n\nDESIGNING FOR USE OF SOLID LUBRICANTS\n\n97\n\nWear debris may not always be detrimental as has been demonstrated in unreported journal-bearing work at MRI. The test was\nstopped periodically and all wear particles were removed from the\nbearing area. In such cases, bearing life was substantially reduced\nfrom that obtained when the wear particles were allowed to remain. Therefore, it seems advisable to use a bearing with a center\ngroove to collect the wear particles with the expectation that they\nwill gradually work back into the load area and contribute to the\nuseful life of the film.\n\nTEMPERATURE\n\nO F\n\nFIGURE\n59.-Effect of temperature on wear-life of typical bonded lubricant films.\n\n98\n\nSOLID LUBRICANTS\n\nTEMPERATURE, LOAD, A N D SPEED CONSIDERATIONS\n\nTemperature, load, and speed will generally affect the wear-life\n\nof bonded solid-film lubricants. In addition, these factors can be\nexpected to interact (combined and related effects). Of these, temperature probably has the most pronounced effect ; this effect on\nthe wear-life for four films is shown in figure 59. As depicted in the\nfigure, there is a drastic decrease in wear-life in air with increased\ntemperature. A similar effect, perhaps even greater, can be expected for most available solid-lubricant films. The reduction in\nwear-life caused by elevated temperature is thought to be primarily\nthe result of two factors : (1) the binders used in the films lose bond\nstrength with increased temperature and (2) the lubricating pigments (MoS,, and graphite) tend t o oxidize more rapidly at elevated temperatures.\nBecause temperature is known to have a large effect on wearlife, the operating temperature should be kept as low as possible.\nBearings lubricated with bonded solid-film lubricants tend to operate\nat higher temperatures than comparable oil- or grease-lubricated\n\nTABLE\nXV.-Temperature\n\nEffecton Coefficientof Friction\nTemperature, "F\n\nLubricant film\nidentification\nMoS,-graphite in\nair-drying binder\n(MIL-L-23398)\nMoS,-graphite,\nsodium silicate binder\nMoS,-graphite,\nphenolic (MIL-L-8937)\nMoS,-graphite, gold,\nsodium silicate binder\nMLF-5*\nMoS,-Sb,O,, hightemperature polyimide\nbinder (MLR-2) *\n\nRoom temperature 200\n\n300\n\n400\n\n500\n\n600\n\n0.05\n\n0.06\n\n0.04\n\n0.04\n\n0.03\n\n0.07\n\n0.08\n\n0.06\n\n0.06\n\n0.07\n\n0.06\n\n0.08\n\n0.07\n\n0.04\n\n0.04\n\n0.04\n\n0.07\n\n0.16\n\n0.08\n\n0.08\n\n0.07\n\n0.08\n\n0.08\n\n0.08\n\n0.04\n\n0.03\n\n0.03\n\n0.02\n\n0.03\n\n0.03\n\nNotes :\n(1) Tests conducted on double rub-shoe test machine (Mark V) described\nin chapter 6.\n(2) Test conditions: 100-lb load at 500 rpm.\n(3) Three repeat tests over entire range.\n* Films developed by Midwest Research Institute for Marshall Space Flight\nCenter.\n\nDESIGNING FOR USE OF SOLID LUBRICANTS\n\nFIGURE\n60.-Friction\n\n99\n\nvs load of a typical bonded film.\n\nbearings because the bonded films usually exhibit higher friction\nand are poor thermal conductors. I n the case of liquid-lubricated\nsystems, the liquid lubricants are often used t o cool the bearings ;because of their inherent nature, bonded solid-film lubricants\nwill not serve this purpose. F o r this reason, the bearing location\nand housing should be designed to take advantage of other methods\nof heat rejection. For example, the bearing housing might be made\nwith a large cross section and have large external surface area.\nVentilation should be provided for the bearing by using radiator\nfins or a cooling fan. The effect of temperature on the coefficient\nof friction of a typical bonded solid-film lubricant is shown in table\nXV. The effect of pressure on the coefficient of friction of a typical\nbonded solid-film lubricant is shown in figure 60.\nI n general, the wear-life of bonded solid-film lubricants is decreased as the load and/or speed is increased. The load and speed\neffects on a phenolic bonded film conforming to MIL-L-8937 are\nshown in figures 61 and 62. The same effects are shown in figures\n63 and 64 on a high-temperature polymeric bonded film developed\nby MRI for NASA (ref. 20).

It is not practical to reproduce the\nspecifications in their entirety for this survey-only highlights of\nthe requirements will be given. Materials covered include : lubricant\npowders, thin films (organic- and inorganic-bonded), plastics, and\nsolid lubricants as additives to greases and oils. The reader can obtain copies of the specifications from the agencies listed in table\nXVI.\nA word of caution is offered in regard to the use of the following\nspecifications. Neither the specifications nor the materials qualified\nto them are cure-alls for every application. Nevertheless, when used\nin a wise and judicious manner, they can be very helpful in the\nselection of specific solid lubricants for particular uses.\nSPECIFICATION BRIEFS\n\nMIL-M-7866: Molybdenum Disulfide, Technical, Lubrication Grade\n\nThis specification covers the requirements for procurement of one\ngrade of powdered molybdenum disulfide to be used for the lubrication of surfaces when boundary conditions exist.

A knowledge of the stress level in\nthe various contacts found in different test devices provides a better\nbasis for comparing test results than the applied load. The purpose\nof this appendix then, is to determine the contact stresses that are\nencountered in the testing of various materials and lubricants on\nthree types of friction and wear-life test devices. The different materials used in the calculation of the stresses were chosen because\nof their widely varying moduli of elasticity.\nContact stresses result from the pressure of one elastic solid on\nanother at limited areas of contact. Most load-resisting members\nare designed on the basis of stress in the main body of the member,\nthat is, in the portions of the body not affected by the stresses a t\nand near the surface of contact where the loads are being applied.\nIn some members, however, the stresses resulting from the surfaces\nof two bodies being forced together by external loads turn out to\nbe the significant stresses. These stresses occur on or slightly beneath the surface of contact and often are the cause of failure in\none or both of the bodies. Examples where the contact stresses may\nwell be the significant stresses are (1) at the area of contact between\na roller or a ball and its race in a rolling element bearing and (2) a t\nthe area of contact between the teeth of a pair of gears in mesh.\nThe theory used in the determination of contact stresses was first\nset forth by H. Hertz in 1881 ;consequently, these stresses are commonly called Hertzian contact stresses. The theory and equations\nused in this work are an adaptation of Hertz\xe2\x80\x99s (ref. 139).\nThe following notation and interpretation of terms are common\nto the calculations for all testing devices :\n\nP = total force exerted by body 1 on body 2, and vice versa\nE,,E, = moduli of elasticity for bodies 1 and 2\np1,p2 = Poisson\xe2\x80\x99s ratio for bodies 1 and 2\n114\n\n115\n\nAPPENDIX B\n\nR,,R,\' = minimum and maximum numerical values of radii, respectively, of the surface of body 1 at the point of\ncontact (The signs of \xe2\x82\xac2, and R,\' are: if the center of\ncurvature is inside the body, the radius is positive;\nif outside the body, it is negative.)\nR2,R2\'= same as R,,R,\', for body 2.\nTEST DEVICES AND CONFIGURATIONS\n\nThe testing devices for which stresses were calculated are (1)\nthe dual rub-shoe machine, (2) the Falex tester, and (3) the pin-ondisk apparatus. The dual rub-shoe machine and FaIex tester involve\nline contact, that is, the contact of a circular cylinder resting on a\nplane. The pin-on-disk apparatus involves point contact which results from a sphere at rest on a plane. The maximum compressive\nstress is calculated for each of these three devices. The compressive\nstress was chosen because it is the maximum contact stress. The\neffect of any lubricant film has been neglected in the calculations.\nThe rub-shoe machine uses a specimen configuration consisting\nof two opposed VI in. wide rub shoes loaded against a 1%in. diam\nby % in. thick rotating lubricated disk a s shown in figure 65. The\nrub-shoe machine is used primarily for determining wear-life and\nfriction of solid-lubricant films.\nThe Falex tester uses a specimen configuration consisting of a\n%-in. diam rotating pin clamped between two %-in. diam and % in.\nlong V-shaped blocks in a nutcracker type arrangement so that load\nis applied to the blocks and consequently t o the rotating pin. This\nconfiguration is shown in figure 66. The Falex tester is used mainly\nfor evaluating the load-carrying capacity of a lubricant.\nThe pin-on-disk configuration consists of a %-in. diam dry ball\nsliding on the lubricated flat surface of a rotating disk shown in\nfigure 67. This apparatus is used to determine the wear-life characteristics of solid-film lubricants.\nIn calculating the contact stresses for the three devices, these\nmaterial combinations were assumed: (1) steel against steel,\n(2) bronze against bronze, and (3) molybdenum against molybdenum.\nRUB SHOE\n\nFIGURE65.-Dual\nrub-shoe\ntest configuration.\n\n116\n\nSOLID LUBRICANTS\n\nLOAD\n\nFIGURE\n66.-Falex test configuration.\n\nPIN\n\nFIGURE\nB\xe2\x80\x99I.-Pin-on disk test\nconfiguration.\n\nFriction values ranging from 0.00 to 0.20 were used in the calculations for rub-shoe and Falex devices. Friction was not considered in\nthe calculations for the pin-on-disk apparatus because its effect on\npoint contact loadings has yet to be determined. Moduli of elasticity\nequal to 15,29, and 50 million psi were used, respectively, for bronze,\nsteel, and molybdenum. Values of Poisson\xe2\x80\x99s ratio of 0.35 for bronze\nand 0.25 for both steel and molybdenum were obtained from Mark\xe2\x80\x99s\nMechanical Engineers\xe2\x80\x99 Handbook (ref. 140) and were used in the\ncalculations.\nSample stress calculations and derived equations for the maximum compressive stress s,are presented for each of the three testing devices, Computer programs for each of the three devices were\nwritten for the purpose of calculating S, for different values of load\nand friction. Computer plots were then made of stress vs load with\ndifferent values of friction for the three material combinations of\nthe rub-shoe and Falex dcevices. Plots were also made of stre% vs\nload for each of the three devices to show the effect of the modulus\nof elasticity on stress (figs. 68 through 76).\n\n117\n\nAPPENDIX B\nHERTZIAN CONTACT STRESS\nR U B - M TEST 5PECIIEN.STEEL C STEEL\nN\nF IS\n\n2\n\nF-0.20\nF-0.15\nF-0.10\nF-0.05\nF-0.0\n\nFRICTIOH COEFFICIENT\n\n120\n\nVI\n\nk\n\np\n\nIon\n\n2\n5\n\n80\n\nLn\nY\n\nc\nLn\nr\n\n60\n\ne\nB\n\n*o\n\nD\n\n*\n\nr\nrn\n\n20\n\n0\n\n0\n\nYO\n\n80\n\n120\n\n160\n\n--SHOE\n\nFIGURE\n68.-Effect\n-rub-shoe\n100\n\n200\n\n240\n\n280\n\n320\n\n360\n\n100\n\nLOm<LB5>\n\nof load and friction on contact stress\nconfiguration, steel on steel.\n\nHERTZIAN CONTACT STRESS\n\nF-0.20\n\nRUB-SHOE TEST SPECIKN,BRONZE W BROHZE\n\n,\n.\n\nF-0.15\nF-0.10\nF-0.05\nF=O .\nO\n\nF IS F R I C T I W COEFFICIENT\n\n30\n\nI\n\nY)\n\n80\nD\nLo\n\n4\n\n70\n\nY)\n3\n\n-\n\n60\n\nz\n\n50\n\nP\ny\nLo\n1\n\nY)\n\n5\n\nYO\n\nr\n0\nz\n\nz\n\nao\n\n5\n\n$\n\nPO\n\nY\nI\n\nLO\n0\n\n0\n\nYO\n\n80\n\n120\n\n160\n\nuua-snoE\n\n200\n\nZYO\n\n210\n\n320\n\n360\n\nYO0\n\nLOR(I(LBSI\n\nFIGURE\n6B.-Effect of load and friction on contact stress\n-rub-shoe configuration, bronze on bronze.\n\nSTRESSES A N D THEIR SIGNIFICANCE\n\nIn the examples used, the stress calculated was the principal or\nmaximum compressive stress.
