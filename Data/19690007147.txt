Introduction\n\nThe overall objective of the solar power system definition studies is to investigate problems associated with\nthe development of spacecraft power systems and to\ndevelop the technology required to solve specific system\ndesign problems for JPL missions. One task which is\npresently being undertaken is the investigation and development of computer programs for power system design\nand analysis.\n2. Shepherd\'s Equation Battery Discharge Computer\nProgram\n\na. Method. A Fortran IV computer program has recently been developed for predicting battery discharge\ncharacteristics. Experimental data, at a constant discharge current, are fitted by the program to an empirical\nequation derived by C. M. Shepherd. This equation describes the battery potential during discharge as a function of discharge time, current density, and other factors.\nThe method used by the computer program for determining the empirical constants of Shepherd\'s equation is\nessentially the same as described in Refs. 1and 2.\n30\n\nThe battery potential during discharge is given as a\nfunction of time, current density, polarization, internal\nresistance, and other factors:\n\nY = E,\n\n-\n\nB\n\n(m)D exp (C\nZ+\n\nF)\n\n- LZ\n(1)\n\nEmpirical values for E,, L, B, C , D, and E are determined by the computer program by numerically fitting\nexperimental discharge data to the above equation. (See\nTable 1for definition of symbols.)\nBattery data consisting of discharge voltage-time data,\ncurrent density, number of voltage plateaus, and plateau\nbase potentials are input to the program. A capacity\nversus voltage curve is computed, then the empirical\nconstants E,, L, B, C , D, and E for the first plateau of\nthe discharge curve are determined by using least-square\ncurve-fitting techniques. Similarly, the empirical constants are computed for the second plateau, provided\nthat one exists. The method is flowcharted as shown in\nFig. 1.\n\nb. Output. The first page of the output for the computer program is shown in Fig. 2.

The latest system design techniques and component technology are being employed to develop optimum power systems for both Mars flyby and orbiter\nspacecraft.\nIn Phase I, General Electric Co. and TRW Systems\ninvestigated and analyzed various candidate power system designs. Each contractor then selected one power\nsystem for recommendation to JPL.\n2. General Electric Co. Study\n\nUsing load power requirements supplied by JPL for a\ntypical early 1970 Mars orbiting mission, the General\nElectric study resulted in the design of a shunt power\nsystem.\n\nA functional block diagram of the shunt regulation\nsystem is shown in Fig. 5. Inverter power (both 2.4 kHz\nand 400 Hz) is derived from a regulated 37.5-V dc bus.\nDirect-current regulation of this bus is maintained by\nsequentially controlling the array shunt regulators, battery charger, and the boost regulator in response to separate regions (Fig. 6) of an error amplifier input voltage\n(see upper right of Fig. 5). The shunt regulator operates\nin the highest error region with maximum solar array\nshunting occurring at V, down to little or no shunting\nat V,. At this voltage, the available array power at the\n\nregulated bus just satisfies the spacecraft load demand\nalong with any battery charging power that may be\nrequired. Increased load demands or a decrease in available solar array power cause the battery charging power\nto be diverted to the load to maintain regulation. This\noccurs in the voltage range V, to V,. With further load\ndemands or further decrease in array power, the boost\nregulator comes on to maintain the regulated bus voltage\nbetween V, and VI.\n\nTo reduce solar array matching problems which arise\nfrom a change in the array current-voltage characteristics\nin the earth-to-Mars transit, diode D3 and relay K1\n(Fig. 5) have been incorporated in the design of the\nshunt system. The solar array power-voltage characteristics shown in Fig. 7 help to illustrate the nature of this\nproblem. For the 1.5-AU curve (Fig. 7)) which is typical\nfor a Mars orbiting mission 90 days after encounter, the\nnormalized voltage at the maximum power point is 1.3 V.\nIf the system-regulated voltage is selected to be 1.3V or\nhigher, no power would be available at this voltage from\nthe solar array near earth (1.0 AU). By selecting a system\nvoltage of 1.2 V, equivalent power can be obtained for\nthe 1.5- and 1.0-AU conditions but with a sacrifice in the\npower at 1.5 AU of about 6%. The in-line diode D3 and\nthe earth/Mars mode relay K1 solve this problem.\nDuring launch and the early cruise phase, K1 is set in\nthe \xe2\x80\x9cearth position. If the solar array voltage is low, the\nboost regulator operates to maintain voltage regulation.\nWhen array voltage is high, the regulated dc bus voltage\nis maintained by the shunt regulator and the array current passes directly through diode D3. In both cases,\nbattery discharge diodes D1 and D2 are back-biased.\nApproximately 2 mo after launch, the change in array\ncharacteristics permits transferring the earth/Mars mode\nrelay K l to the \xe2\x80\x9cMars\xe2\x80\x9d position M. This prevents array/\nbattery load sharing during later phases when the solar\narray power capability becomes limited. Two system\nmodes of operation will predominate.\n\nW\nU\n\n>\n\xe2\x80\x9c\nI\nv)\n\n2\n\n>\nI1\n>\n\n0\n\nFig. 6.

Battery charging is not\ninhibited since array power is much greater than\nrequired to support the spacecraft power demand.\nThe shunt regulator is \xe2\x80\x9cstanding by\xe2\x80\x9d on line. During emergence from a solar occultation near earth,\nthe shunt regulator will be operating with the\nboost regulator off.\n(2) Near Mars, the shunt regulator will be operating\nfrom solar array power with the boost regulator off.\n35\n\n1 .o\n\n0.9\n\n0.8 -\n\n0.7\nCL\n\n2\n9\n\n0.6\n\n>-\n\n\'\n\nQ,\n\n\'\n5l\nN\n-\n\n5\nz\n\n0.5\n\n0.4\n\n0.3\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\n1.6\n\n1.8\n\nNORMALIZED ARRAY VOLTAGE\n\nFig. 7.

Unregulated bus\nvoltage range has been reduced from 25-50 V dc\n(Mariner Mars 1969) to 25-38.2 V dc. The power system\nrecommended by General Electric weighs 0.3 lb more\nthan the present Mariner Mars 1969 power system.\n3. TRW Systems Study\n\nTRW recommended a buck-boost power system. A\nsimplified block diagram of this system is shown in Fig. 8.\nA regulated 50-V dc bus supplies power to the 400-Hz\n36\n\nand 2.4-kHz inverters and to the various spacecraft dc\nloads (traveling-wave tube, heaters, etc.). Regulation is\nprovided by a buck-boost line regulator. Redundant\nsilver-zinc 25 A-h batteries have been included in the\nsystem design. Battery charging power is obtained from\nthe regulated dc bus. A current-limiting resistor and a\nrelay are used to control charging. Ground command\nbackup capability is provided to override the automatic\ncharge control circuitry that controls the relay.\nPower system reliability has been enhanced through\nincorporation of current limiting and operational redundancy in the buck-boost regulator. The need for zener\ndiode voltage limiters on the solar array has been eliminated. Packaging requirements reduce the number of\npower conditioning modules from 10 (Mariner Mars\n1969) to 6.

Introduction\n\nThe purpose of these studies is to determine the characteristics of solar cell contacts, especially as a function\nof exposure to various environmental conditions. Many\nproblems exist with present-day state-of-the-art titaniumsilver contacts, with and without solder coating. The\nmanufacturers have not analyzed solar cell contacts sufficiently to determine what characteristics the cells will\nhave as a result of exposure to environmental extremes.\n2. Testing\n\na. Ferranti Electric, lnc. cells. These cells have contacts fabricated by plating nickel onto the silicon and\nlayers of copper and gold over the nickel. Forty-eight\ncells, 24 fabricated from 1 0-cm material and 24 from\n10 a-cm, have been exposed to an environment consisting\nof 95% relative humidity at a temperature of 60\xc2\xb0C for\na period of 48 h.\nBefore and after environmental exposure, the cells\nwere electrically tested at a cell temperature of 28 k 1\xc2\xb0C\nin a tungsten simulator having a color temperature of\n2800\xc2\xb0K and an equivalent solar intensity of approximately 100 mW/cm2. The tungsten simulator will be used\nextensively during these studies because of the excellent\nstability and reproducibility of the spectral and intensity\ncharacteristics of this source. Since the nature of the\nmeasurements to be made is, for the most part, comparative (i.e., pre- and post-environmental exposure), the\nfact that the tungsten spectrum differs from the sunlight\nspectrum should not affect the analysis.\n\nV\n\ncircuit\ncurrent,\nmA\n\nVoltage\natmax\npower,\n\nBefore\nexposure\n\n0.583\n\n99.6\n\n8.\n89\n\n0.480\n\n4.\n30\n\n0.73\n\nAfter\nexposure\n\n0.584\n\n98.7\n\n88.7\n\n0.477\n\n42.4\n\n0.73\n\nBefore\nexposure\n\n0.542\n\n100.3\n\n9.\n30\n\n0.436\n\n4.\n06\n\n0.74\n\nAfter\nexposure\n\n0.545\n\n9.\n18\n\nI 0.439\n\n40.4\n\n0.74\n\nElectrical tests before and after exposure of the cells\nto this rather severe environment were performed under\ntungsten illumination, the intensity being adjusted to\n38\n\nMax\npower,\nmW\n\nV\n\ncurve\npowei\nfactor,\n\n%\n\n-\n\n1 a-cm\n\n10 0-cm\n\n9.1\n90\n\n=The curve power factor i s a measure of the \xe2\x80\x9csquoreness\xe2\x80\x9d\ncurve power factor\n\n=\n\nI\n\nof the curve:\n\nmax power\nshort-circuit current X open-circuit voltage\n\ncorrespond to a solar intensity of 100 mW/cm2.

The series resistance before and after exposure\nwas not measured, but the fact that the pre- and postexposure curve power factors were identical strongly\nindicates that there was no large change in series resistance.\nThe high-vacuum sputtered aluminum contact cells\ndeveloped by Ion Physics under JPL contract exhibited\nno significant electrical degradation as a result of a 30day exposure to the severe environment of 95% relative\nhumidity at 80\xc2\xb0C. A slight increase in series resistance\nwas observed, but this is believed to be primarily due to\na layer of aluminum oxide which formed as a result of\nthe test, and which acted as a thin insulating layer between the test probes and the aluminum. In many cases,\nit was found that a slight scraping of the contact significantly lowered the series resistance. It is anticipated that\nin actual flight-use the cells would be interconnected\nprior to such exposures so that oxidation, at least of the\nmagnitude observed here, would not result in an increase\nof series resistance.\n\nD. Solar Cell Standardization, R. F. Greenwood\n1 . Introduction\n\nStandard solar cells calibrated above 97% of the\nearth\xe2\x80\x98s atmosphere using high-altitude balloons have\nbeen effectively used over the past several years to aid\nin the prediction of solar array output. The standard\ncells are mounted in modular form, permitting temperature control and providing a means to electrically load\nthe cell and monitor its output. Two 1-X 2-cm cells or\none 2- X 2-cm cell can be mounted on the module. The\nmodular form also provides protection for the cell during\nnormal handling and during payload impact upon balloon\nflight termination.\nStandard solar cells are also used to aid in establishing\nthe light intensity and evaluating the spectral content\nof solar simulators. Balloon-calibrated standard solar\nJPL SPACE PROGRAMS SUMMARY 37-53, VOL. 111\n\ncells in conjunction with a simulator are presently being\nused to classify solar cells according to power output\nduring cell procurements, thus eliminating the use of a\npyrheliometer.\nCooperative efforts between JPL and other NASA and\ngovernment agencies have provided standard solar cells\nat minimum expense for space flight programs and\nadvanced solar cell development.\n2. Description of Calibrated Solar Cells\n\nSolar cells submitted for calibration on the 1968\nballoon flight series were from several sources. The NASA\nGoddard Space Flight Center supplied eight modules\ncontaining 1- X 2-cm N/P Heliotek solar cells which\nare intended for use with the Orbiting Astronomical\nObservatory program. The German Research Satellite\nCorp., in cooperation with NASA Goddard Space Flight\nCenter, submitted seven 1-cell modules, six of which\nwere balloon-calibrated and all of which were correlated\nin the JPL X-25L solar simulator. Four of the cells were\nmanufactured by Siemens AG and three by AEGTelefunken. Both suppliers are located in West Germany.\nThe Air Force Aero Propulsion Laboratory supplied\neight modules containing advanced development soIar\ncells. Three modules contained ion-implanted silicon cells.\nThree were assembled with cadmium sulfide solar cells\nhaving an H-film (Kapton) covering, and two modules\ncontained cadmium telluride solar cells.\nTwo modules fabricated by the NASA Langley Research\nCenter to aid in solar cell calibration were included on\nthe flights. Heliotek 1- X 2-cm N/P cells having a base\nresistivity of 10 a-cm were used in the module assembly.\nThe Applied Physics Laboratory submitted a solar cell\nand bandpass filter experiment. The experiment consisted\nof five solar cells and four interference-type bandpass\noptical filters designed to divide the solar cell response\ninto four equal energy bands. The fifth cell was unfiltered.\nCalibration data from the cell-filter combinations are\nintended for use with laboratory solar simulators.\nThe Jet Propulsion Laboratory included several experimental modules, as well as modules for use on a possible\nMariner Mars 1971 flight. A unique experiment employing a filter wheel in conjunction with four solar cells and\ntwo radiometers was flown. The radiometers, more\naccurately described as enclosed standard cavity active\nradiometers, were designed and built at JPL.\n39\n\n3. Results of the 1968 Balloon Flights\n\nA series of three 80,000-ft balloon flights was conducted in the vicinity of Minneapolis, Minnesota during\nthe months of July and August, 1968. The solar trackers\nwhich had been modified to increase the payload capacity functioned perfectly throughout the flights. Figure 9\nshows the modified tracker with payload mounted for\nflight 1. The tracker provides space for as many as 26\nsolar cell modules in the event that all modules should\ncontain a single 2- X 2-cm cell. Two additional spaces\nare available to accommodate temperature-monitoring\nmodules.\nGood data were returned from each flight. Also, excellent correlation with solar simulator measurements was\nobtained prior to and following the flights. All cells were\nrecovered, although two modules suffered minor damage\nupon impact of the second flight payload. The solar\ntracker was extensively damaged and a spare tracker\nwas used for the third flight.\nFlight data on all solar cells have been reduced through\na computer program and all modules, along with calibration data, have been returned to the respective agencies.\nA formal report on the 1968 balloon flights is now in\nprogress.\n\nE. Advanced Roll-Up Solar Array Concept,\nW. A. Hasbach\n\n7. Program Objective\n\nA program was initiated by JPL in June 1967 to investigate the feasibility of developing a 10-kW solar array\nsystem which would have a specific power capability of\n30 W/lb and could be deployed after launch through\na roll-out technique similar to that employed in a\nwindow shade.\nThe ever-increasing power requirements of the spacecraft, coupled with limited launch vehicle storage capacities, dictated the need to evaluate new deployment and\nstructural designs of solar power panels. Improvement\nin the solar cell conversion efficiency is not anticipated\nin the immediate future. However, improvements in the\npower-to-weight ratio appear feasible using lightweight\nstructural concepts and packaging techniques. Hence,\nemphasis is placed upon the mechanical-structural aspects of the solar array.\nStudies performed by General Electric Co., FairchildHiller Corp., and Ryan Aeronautical Co. indicate that\nthe program objective of a 30-W/lb power-to-weight\nratio system can be achieved. The total array will consist\nof four roll-out panels, each containing 250 ftz of deployed\nsurface area. The four roll-out panels will be mounted\nsymmetrically about the base of the spacecraft and will\ndeploy uniformly without disturbing the center of gravity\nof the vehicle.\nPrevious accomplishments in this program were\nreported in SPS 37-48, Vol. 1 1 pp. 51-57 and SPS 37-49,\n1,\nVOl. 111, pp. 93-99.\n2. Configuration Studies\n\nFor analysis, the roll-out array can be divided into\nthree major components:\n(1) The deployment mechanism or extendible boom.\n(2) The storage drum upon which the solar cell substrate is wrapped during storage and launch.\n(3) The substrate upon which the solar cells are\nattached.\n\nAlthough the feasibility of 30 W/lb solar cell power\nsystems appears to be within the current state-of-the-art,\nsignificant questions still exist:\nFig. 9. Modified solar tracker\n\n40\n\n(1) Will the substrate track uniformly during the\nretracting cycle?\nJPL SPACE PROGRAMS SUMMARY 37-53, VOL. 111\n\n(2) Will thermal cycling degrade the array output?\n(3) Will the solar cell/coverglass combination be\nadequately protected during launch?\nIn this article, the greatest emphasis will be placed on\nthe deployment mechanisms proposed by each of the\nthree contractors. Both the substrates and storage drums\n\nare sufficiently common to all designs to allow for a\ngeneral discussion of each.\nDuring the study of deployment methods, it was noted\nby the three contractors that no one extendible boom\nsystem (Fig. 10) was clearly the preferred choice to\nachieve the desired objectives of this program.

Also, analysis of the various\napproaches has shown that they will survive the environments defined by applicable specifications.\n3. Deployment Methods\n\na. Generul Electric Co. Figure 11 shows a single-rod\ndeployment scheme, using a de Havilland bi-stem extendible element, This element consists of two stainless\nsteel tapes which are pre-stressed and wrapped on a\nstorage drum. As the two tapes are unrolled from the\nstorage drum, they form tubes, one within the other.\nFastened at the leading edge of the bi-stem is a cross\nmember to which the substrate material is attached.\nThis cross member is free to rotate through a ball bearing joint. The free floating end member is so designed as\nto allow the extendible rod torsional freedom during\ndeployment. As the bi-stem rod is extended, it unrolls\n\nthe solar cell substrate from the storage drum. Positive\ntension is maintained on the substrate at all times by\nmeans of a \xe2\x80\x9cnegator\xe2\x80\x9d spring in the storage drum. Substrate tension is required to keep the solar cell surface\nplane flat within 10 deg and to provide a minimum\nnatural frequency of 0.04 Hz. To achieve these conditions, it has been calculated that a substrate tension of\n4.0 lb is required.\nThe bi-stem is fabricated of 0.007-in.-thick No. 301\nstainless steel (silver-plated). Its extended length is 33.5\nf t and its diameter is 1.34 in. The extension and retraction\nrates are 1.5 in./s.\n\nb. Fairchild-Hiller Corp. Figure 12 also shows a singleboom deployment system, but the extension mechanism\ndesign is considerably different from other designs investigated during this study. Deployment is accomplished\n\nARRAY BLANKET\n\nCABLE HINGE\n\nDIMENSIONS IN INCHES\n\nFig. 12.

The folding\narms consist of three full-length arms and two half-length\narms. The half-length arms are end members of the folding arm linkage with the full arms in between. The outboard half link is pinned to the cross member which pulls\nthe solar cell substrate from the storage drum.\nInterconnecting each arm section is a fitting operated\nby a pulley cable arrangement. This technique is best\ndescribed by comparing it to a drafting machine. In\nthe programming of the joint action, it is essential that\nthe arm linkages extend the end member in a straight\nline to avoid distorting the solar cell substrate during\ndeployment and retraction. During deployment, tension\nis maintained on the substrate by means of a negator\nspring, as in the General Electric design, to assure a\nminimum natural frequency of 0.04 Hz in the substrate\nand to keep the substrate surface plane flat within 10\ndeg. To achieve these conditions, Fairchild-Hiller has\ndetermined that a force of 10.0 lb should be applied.\nIn the folding arm design, stainless steel, titanium,\naluminum, and beryllium are used for the control cables,\npulleys, and associated hardware. Boron/epoxy composites have been selected for the cross member to which\n\nthe solar cell substrate is attached and for the arm\nsegments. The arm segments are corrugated 3.0-in.2 tubes\nwith a wall thickness of 0.911 in. When extended, the\ntotal length of the arms is 39.1 ft. The deployment and\nretraction rates are not yet established.\nc. Ryan Ammutdcal Co. Figure 13 shows a system\nusing two deployment booms. Unlike the General Electric and Fairchild-Hiller systems, the solar cell substrate\nis fastened between the two booms, along the edges,\nby means of tabs at intervals of approximately 4.0 in.\nThe two booms, which collapse as they are wound about\na drum, store on the same drum as the solar cell substrate.\n\nThe booms are pre-stressed titanium, constructed of\nidentical halves, welded along their entire length. In\ntheir natural state, the two halves are expanded, forming\na hollow tube. When compressed, they can be wrapped\ntightly about a drum or cylinder.\nAs the booms are deployed, the solar cell substrate\nis carried off of the same storage drum. No substrate\ntension is considered necessary because of the edge\nsupport by the two-beam system. Thermal deflection is\nmaintained within the allowed 10-deg bending, by sizing\nof the two beams and thermal control coating.\n\nTORQUE SHAFT\nARRAY BLANKET\n\nCENTER SUPPORT\nTO SPACECRAFT\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c-LEADING EDGE\nMEMBER\n\nARRAY END\nSUPPORT TO\nSPACECRAFT\n\nDIMENSIONS IN INCHES\n\nFig. 13.

In the fully deployed condition, the booms are\nextended to 33 ft. The deployment and retraction rate\nis 1.7 in./s.\n4. Substrate Materials\n\nDuring the materials selection effort of this program,\nthe contractors evaluated various candidate substrate\nmaterials; the two most promising were fiberglass and\nDupont Kapton H-film. Kapton H-film was selected for\nits greater tear resistance, greater flexible strength, and\nstrength-to-weight advantage.\nBecause of the two-boom system selected, Ryan can\nmanufacture the substrates of O.OOl-in.-thick H-film.\nGeneral Electric, with a substrate tension of 4.0lb, has\nselected 0.002-in. H-film. Fairchild-Hiller, having the\nhighest substrate tension of 10 lb, is using 0.003-in.\nH-film.\n5. Storage Drum\n\nEach contractor will use a cylindrical drum upon which\nthe solar cell substrate will be stored. The drums vary\nin diameter from 5.0 to 12.0 in.\nChoice of drum material by the contractor is optional\ninasmuch as the materials chosen can be used interchangeably between the three designs without a significant weight penalty. With the exception of the graphite/\nepoxy composite material used by Fairchild-Hiller, all\nmaterials are available and considered state-of-the-art.\nComposite materials have limited acceptance in proven\napplications. General Electric has specified beryllium;\nRyan has specified either beryllium or titanium as drum\nmaterials.\n\nF. Planetary Solar Array Development,\nW. A. Hasbach\n\nTrade-off studies of weight, power capabilities, and\nstructural integrity versus exposure to the Martian\nenvironment have resulted in the selection of a preferred\nsolar array design for a soft lander capsule. Although\nstudies have confirmed three possible approaches which\nhave the potential of meeting the program objective, one\nis felt to be more worthy of further investigation. The\nnon-oriented conical truncated cone (Fig. 14) was\nselected as the most feasible design because of its higher\n44\n\nreliability factor, best compromise in power versus\nweight, absence of electrical motor gear drives, no power\nrequirement necessary for operation, and its design\ngrowth potential; this array, once released from its\nlocked, launched, and ilight position, will require no\npower from the lander capsule for deployment or continuous operation for the mission life of 1yr. A summary\nof earlier studies of the three possible approaches appears\nin SPS 37-51, Vol. 111, pp. 37-41.\nThe non-oriented conical truncated cone array, as\nrecognized initially in its concept, will not meet the\ndesired goal of 20 W/lb (1AU) and under worst-case conditions will attain less than the minimum power requirement of 200 W of electrical power at solar noon. On\nthe other hand, Figs. 15 and 16 show that in the large\nmajority of cases the power output exceeds the minimum\nrequirement of 200 W. The worst-case minimum power\nis 5% low at 190 W. The best-case condition is 35%\nhigh at 256 W. The average noon power outputs of the\nlimiting conditions shown are 17% high at 223 W. At\nthe higher solar intensities that occur during the spring\nand fall seasons, the power level is above 200 W for all\nconditions.\nThe power-to-weight ratio varies with the power output of the array at noon at a specific Martian location.\nThe range of power outputs for the first day of summer\n(lowest solar intensity) are shown for the noon conditions\nin Figs. 15 and 16.

Electrolytic Determination ob the Effective\nSurface Area of the Silver Electrode, Part II,\nG. L. luvinall\n\n1. Introduction\n\nA major objective of the continuing study of the\nreaction geometry of alkaline battery electrodes is the\ndevelopment of new and better methods of measurement\nof the effective electrolytic surface area of a working\nelectrode. This study is being performed at Brigham\nYoung University under JPL contract; Dr. Eliot Butler\nis the principal investigator. Earlier results of the surface\narea studies were reported in SPS 37-39, Vol. IV,\npp. 19-21. A new coulometric potentiostatic method is\nreported here.\n2. Measurement Method\n\nThe new method of electrode area determination is\nbased upon the charge-acceptance per unit area of\n\nsmooth standard electrodes. The charge-acceptance can\nbe directly related to the thickness of the oxide layer\nformed during the oxidation of the silver electrode in\nalkaline solution. At present, the relationship between\nthe charge-acceptance per unit area and the applied\npotential in a constant potential oxidation is under study.\nEarlier work on the aluminum-aluminum oxide electrode has shown that the charge-acceptance per unit\narea is the same at identical applied potentials for electrodes of different surface roughness (Ref. 1). Thus, the\nfollowing equation may be used to calculate surface area:\n\naunknown\n\n= astandard\n\nqunknown\nqstandard\n\nwhere a = surface area in cm2 and q = total charge in\ncoulombs. Two oxidation runs are required; then, if the\narea of one electrode is known, the area of the other can\nbe calculated. The total charge is obtained from the\nintegral of the voltagetime curve. A diagram of\nthe potentiostat and integrator circuit is shown in Fig. 17.\nFigure 18 is a diagram of the oxidation cell, showing\nthe location of the electrodes. This electrode arrangement minimizes the I-R drop between the reference and\nworking electrodes.

Standard electrodes were prepared by the vapor deposition of metallic\nsilver on smooth glass discs.\n3. Results and Conclusions\n\nA plot of charge-acceptance per unit area of smooth\nstandard electrodes versus applied potential is shown\nin Fig. 19. The purpose of this curve is to indicate\nacceptable ranges of potential for use in the constant\npotential estimation of surface area. For example, the\nregion from 0.275 to 0.315 V versus the Hg-HgO reference is not acceptable; there are large changes in charge\nacceptance coupled with small changes in applied potential. Conversely, the region from 0.325 to 0.400 V is\ndesirable because of its flatness. Here, small errors in\npotentiostatic control cause only small variations in\ncharge-acceptance.\nComparison runs were made on silver foil discs of two\ndifferent geometric areas. Four runs on electrodes of\neach size were made utilizing the previously reported\nconstant current method (SPS 37-39, Vol. IV), giving a\nreproducibility in surface area of +3%. Four runs were\nalso made potentiostaticalIy on electrodes of each size\nat an applied potential of 0.400V versus Hg-HgO. The\nreproducibiIity in total charge passed was *7%. These\nresults are in agreement within experimental accuracy.\n\ncurrent method was taken as the area of the standard\nelectrode for use in the calculation. The results of the\ncalculations are given in Table 4. The method apparently\nis a very promising one for the electrolytic determination\nof the effective electrode surface area.\nReference\n\n1.

X-ray side-view of a three-ceil monoblock,\nshowing large voids and misaligned plates\n\n49\n\nThe two preliminary problem areas that were examined\nin the course of this effort were cell seals and plate\nalignment. Both can affect cell performance.\n\nA 250 kV General Electric x-ray camera has been used\nto x-ray over 50 monoblocks (150 cells).\n2. Cell Seals\n\nPlate lead wires are positioned through a subcover and\nan upper cover. Between these two covers is a cavity\nwhich is filled with an opaque potting material to seal\naround the 25 lead wire bundles. Voids and defects in\nthe areas around the wires allow cell leakage to occur\nmore rapidly during environmental or cycling tests, and\nthus affect the test results adversely.\nAn example of the x-ray side-view of a three-cell monoblock may be seen in Fig. 20. This x-ray shows what\nappear to be voids in the upper cavity around the plate\nlead wires. In a sealed silver-zinc cell (the Mariner cell\nis this type) it is necessary to prevent electrolyte leakage\n\nresulting from the electrolyte \xe2\x80\x9cwicking up\xe2\x80\x9d the plate lead\nwires to the external environment. T i condition results\nhs\nin degraded performance and ultimate failure. Encapsulation around the plate lead wires prevents such electrolyte leakage. Voids in the potting material around the\nplate lead wires substantially reduce the impeded leakage\npath to the outside of the cell. Variations in the size,\nnumber, and location of these voids could cause cell\nfailures due to leakage that would occur at different rates\nand under different conditions. Defects of this nature\ncould influence the evaluation of a design for a flight\nbattery.\nA monoblock was progressively dissected in a serial\ncross-section manner, parallel to the plane of the x-ray\nview seen in Fig. 20. The results of this sectioning showed\nthe presence of large voids, as seen in one section in\nFig. 21. The size, shape, and location of the voids were\naccurately predicted by the x-ray radiographs.\nWhen the existence of voids of this nature was confirmed, a number of changes in the potting process were\n\nFig. 21. Results of sectioning three-cell monoblock, showing large voids\n\n50\n\nJPL SPACE PROGRAMS SUMMARY 37-53, VOL. 111\n\ninstituted. Subsequent production and x-ray analysis of\nmore cells resulted in the type of upper cavity potting\nshown in Fig. 22. The process changes virtually eliminated all voids, so that in all the newly fabricated cells,\nthe seals in this area are as alike as possible.\n3. Plate Alignment\n\nAlthough the cell case is visually inspected after plate\ninsertion, considerable plate-pack misalignment can\nresult because of process variations and inspection limitations. Subsequent cycle data can be affected by misaligned plates.\nThe misalignment of cell plate packs can affect cell\ncapacity if portions of the active electrode surface areas\nare not fully reacted. Figure 20 shows the three-cell\nmonoblock with plates misaligned in the vertical direction.\nNote the large variation between the tops of some adjacent plates. It is quite possible that these cells would not\nperform as well as others with better plate alignment,\nparticularly after several cycles. This condition would\nthen cause considerable spread in capacity data and\nhinder the completion of an accurate design evaluation.\n\nABSENCE OF LARGE\nVOIDS I UPPER\nN\n\n4. Conclusions\n\nAlthough at present in-process x-ray of plate alignment is not possible, future production procedures might\nbe modified to include this type of inspection and allow\na realignment step. Certainly, such a procedure would\nmake the cells as alike as possible, allowing better comparison of test results. If the realignment step proves to be\nimpractical, then at least the x-ray catalogue of every\ncell used in a test program would aid in pointing out\nthose differences in performance or failure rates that\nwere due to structural inconsistencies rather than to\nactual design deficiencies.\n\n1. Calorimetric Measurements on the Surveyor\nMain Battery, w. L. Long\n1. Introduction\n\nThe mission requirements of future JPL space programs may be expected to impose increasingly severe\noperating constraints on the spacecraft power system.\nA battery system designed for a long, sophisticated\nmission, such as a multiplanet probe, will necessarily be\noperating much closer to the performance limits than\never before. In addition, more complicated environmental\nand component compatibility problems arise.\nCalorimetric data on spacecraft components are always\nrequired for proper thermal control. Heat generation\nby most electrical components is obtained from inputoutput efficiencies, and, for a constant power level, the\nheat generated is fairly constant. However, the heat generated by a silver-zinc battery varies with state of charge\nas well as with power level, and accurate calorimetric\ndata will be necessary for future spacecraft design\nstudies. Preliminary work in this area has been previously\nreported (Ref. 1). This work is being continued by\nHughes Aircraft Co. under JPL contract.\n2. Battery Description\n\nThe Surveyor main battery, as manufactured by ESB\nCo., is a 150 A-h, 14-cell, sealed silver-zinc battery. The\ncell cases are constructed of polystyrene; the battery case\nis magnesium, The total weight of the flight hattery is\n46.5 lb.\n3. Measurement Technique\nFig. 22.

The liquid is heated by automatic precalibrated electric heaters, and thus maintained at the\nboiling point automatically. When heat is given off or\nabsorbed by the battery, the change in power furnished\nto the heater is automatically recorded. When steady-state\noperation is reached, the change in power is the heat\ngenerated (or absorbed) by the battery. Provisions are\nindluded for maintaining constant pressure, constant\nrate of vaporization, and for the return of condensed\nvapor at a constant temperature. Freon F-113 was used\nfor these tests.\n4. Results\n\nThe results of the preliminary measurements show\nthat the Surveyor battery produces heat equivalent to\n5 W of power during a 5-A discharge. The battery produces heat equivalent to 80 W of power during an 18-A\ndischarge. These results are based on steady-state operation. It is apparent that the heat evolution increases very\nsharply with an increase in discharge rate.\nFurther studies will extend the measurements to different discharge rates and temperatures, as well as define\nthe effects of state of charge on heat generation by\nthe battery.\nReference\n1.

Six-Converter Solar Thermionic Generator,\n0. S. Merrili\n\n1 . Introduction\n\nThis is a summary of the work performed by Thermo\nElectron Corp., Waltham, Mass., under JPL contract\nduring the period from Jan. 10, 1967 through Mar. 31,\n1968 (Ref. 1). The work reported includes the design\nand fabrication of a six-converter solar thermionic. generator designated as JG-4, and the design, fabrication,\nand performance testing of twelve identical converters,\nsix of which were incorporated into the generator. The\ngenerator is to operate in a solar-energy concentrating\nsystem consisting of a parabolic mirror of 57-in. rim\nradius and a 69-in. focal length. The mirror generates a\nsolar image in the form of a circular ellipsoid which at\nthe focal plane of the mirror has a cross-sectional area\nof about 0.885 in.2and an approximate maximum energy\n52\n\nof 5000 W at 1 AU. The design of the six converters is\nsimilar to that of the series VI11 converters (used in previous solar generators; SPS 37-40, Vol. IV, pp. 1-14) but\nhas been modified to be compatible with a six-converter\nsystem. The converters have planar electrodes with a Re\nemitter and Mo collector. The emitter area is 2 cm2. The\nconverters are designed to operate at an emitter temperature of 2000\xc2\xb0K at an interelectrode spacing of 2 mils.\n2. Generator\n\nA detailed review and evaluation was made of the\noriginal generator design.l This was necessitated by tests\nconducted at JPL subsequent to the original design which\nshowed that solid Re emitters and Re sleeves were more\nreliable for extended operation than the Ta substrate\npressure-bonded Re emitters and Ta sleeves proposed\nin the original design. However, incorporating solid Re\nemitters into the converters of the generator required\nredesign of the generator cavity because of the lower\nthermal conductivity of Re. The new design has the rear\nsurfaces of the six emitters (Re) forming a cylindrical\ncavity of 0.61-in. radius and 0.658-in. length. The front\nopening of the cavity is to be placed at a distance of\nabout 0.4 in. behind the mirror\xe2\x80\x99s focal plane, i.e., towards\nthe sun. This produces optimum impingement and absorption of the solar energy on the cavity wall.\n\nA tungsten cone with a 1-in. diameter opening protects the cavity walls from adverse effects caused by\nmisalignment of the generator and the mirror. The rear\nof the cavity is formed by a highly reflective electropolished W surface in the form of an inverted, doubly\ntruncated cone (back-piece), so designed as to direct\nreflected solar energy uniformly to the^ cavity wall (the\nemitters). This back-piece reflector is thermally isolated\nfrom the converters. The energy absorbed by the reflector\nis dissipated by a large Cr,O,-coated Mo radiator which\nis brazed to the W piece by a high-temperature braze.\nDuring solar operation, the W back-piece is designed to\noperate at a temperature less than 1200\xc2\xb0C. With this\nsolar image-cavity arrangement, which is expected to\nresult in a near-optimum generator performance, approximately 4500 W of solar energy enter the cavity; 200 W\nare absorbed by the front piece; 2300 W are absorbed\nby the six Re emitters; 1400 W are absorbed by the W\nback-piece; the remaining 600 W are reflected and/or\nre-radiated and escape through the front opening of\nthe cavity.\n\xe2\x80\x98JG4,discussed in Thermo Electron Corp. Report TE 18-66, JPL\nContract 951230.\n\nJPL SPACE PROGRAMS SUMMARY 37-53, VOL. 111\n\nConsiderable effort was devoted to the generator\nassembly, which required the fabrication of special tools\nfor aligning to critical tolerances the converters and the\nback-piece which form the cavity. Prior to constructing\nthe Mo block, to which the various parts of the generator\nwere mounted, an AI model was fabricated and checked\nfor feasibility of the overall block design.\nOther work performed in association with the JG-4\nincluded the evaluation of the thermal transfer characteristics o the 0.65 Pd-O.35 Co braze selected for joining\nf\nthe W and M o parts of the cavity back-piece. For this\npurpose, two samples, identical in geometry, were prepared and tested. One sample consisted of a W and a Mo\ndisk joined together with the 0 6 Pd-0.35 Co braze; the\n.5\na\nother sample w s a solid Mo disk. Both samples were\ntested under identical conditions, and comparison of\nthe test results indicated that the rate of heat bander\nin the W-brazeMo sample was equal to or slightly\nhigher than that measured in the all-Mo sample.\n\nw t the electron\nih\nThe completed generator (JM),\nbombardment unit attached for eIectrically heating the\ngenerator during laboratory testing, is shown in Fig. 23.\nFigure 2 shows a close-up of the generator cavity.\n4\n3. Converters\n\nTwelve identical thermionic converters (Fig.2S) were\nfabricated and individually tested; six of these converters were incorporated into the generator. During the\ntest of each converter, the output current was measured\nat Merent output voltages and at given emitter temperatures, with the cesium temperature optimized for\nmaximum output. AI1 twelve converters generated nearly\nidentical data. The current-voltage data indicate an\naverage power output of 37.5 W frmn each converter,\nor a total of 225 W from the six converters used. The\nsame power output was obtained at a lower emitter temperature but also at a lower output voltage. The performance characteristics of the six converters used in\nthe generator are shown in Fig. 26.\nConsiderable effort was expended in the preparation\nof the Re sleeves, which developed vacuum leaks during\n\nFig. 23.

Introduction\n\nThe objective of the power conversion circuit development task is to develop advanced technology power\nconditioning components, i.e., regulators, inverters,\nbattery chargers, etc., capable of meeting JPL advanced\nmission requirements.\nThe most recent activity on this task has been to\ndevelop a boost regulator with characteristics that are\nsigniiicantly better than the characteristics presently\navailable in the Mariner spacecraf? boost regulators. In\nparticular, efficiency, transient response, and a reduced\nnumber of component parts were all goals of this regulator development program.\n\nInput\nInput voltage, V\nReverse polarity protecfion\n\nEnvironmental\nOperating temperature range, "C\nSunival temperature range, "C\nDegraded performance range, "C\noutput\nBfficiency {min), %\nRegulation (line, load, and temperature\nvariation), %\nOuipvt voltage, Vdc\nOutput ripple, mV rms\n\n\'IN\n\n25 to 50\nYes\n\n- 10 to 75\n-55 to 145\n-40 to 100\n90\n\n*%\n56\nless ihan\n\n50\n\n.\n.*\n\nINPUT\nFILTER\n\n1\n\nSpecification\ncharocteristic\n\nOUTPUT\nFILTER\n\nOT\n\' U,\n\nERROR\nAMPLIFIER\n\nI\n\nFig. 28.

Regulator Requirements a n d Description\n\n"he design requirement goals for the boost regulator\nare shown in Table 5, Thee power levels were of interest:\n100,ZOO, and 400 W. Figure 28 shows the functional block\ndiagram for the regulator design that was developed.\nWhen Q1 is t u n e d on, the current in the left side of\nT l will increase, and, due to transformer action, the\nvoltage on the light side of T I will also increase. When\nthe voltage reaches a set level (56 V), the error amplifier\nsignals the drive amplifier. The drive amplifier then tuns\nQ off. The voltage out of TI wiu then start: to decrbase.\nl\nVhen the voltage decreases sufficiently, the error amplifier signals the drive amplifier to again turn Q1 on. f i e\ncycle then repeats. The input and output filters are\ninductance-capacitance type filters.\nThe error amplifier is a dserential amplilier using a\nzener diode reference. As can be seen in Fig, 28, the\n56\n\nQl, T1 combination only has to supply voltage in excess\nof the input voltage, V,,, - Vi,. This keeps the power\nswitched by Q l to a minimum. Since Q1 is switching\nrelatively small quantities of power, the eEciency of this\ntype of \'circuit can be quite high.\n"he performance characteristicsQ$ the 200-W regulator,\nwhich are typical of those obtained for the other power\nlevels, are shown in Table 6 along with the characteristics\nof the Mariner Mars 1969 boost regulator. The Murine?\nMars 1969 boost regulator uses magnetic amplifier control, while the developed boost regulator uses solid-state\ncontrol. This means that the transient response of the\ndeveloped boost regulator is better than that of d e\nMariner Mars 1969 boost regulator. There are 66 parts\nin the new regulator; the Marher regulator has 74 parts.\n3 Conclusion\n.\nBecause of the increase in efficiency, regulation, and\ntransient response and the reduction in parts, the newly\nJPL SPACE PROGRAMS SUMMARY 37-53, VOL. 111\n\n2.
