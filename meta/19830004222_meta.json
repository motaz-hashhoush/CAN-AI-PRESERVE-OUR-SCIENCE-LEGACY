Radiances were measured with the handheld radiometer on clear mornings throughout the growing season. Aircraft overflight measurements were made at the end of tillering and during the early stem extension period, and the mid-heading period. The IR/red ratio and normalized difference vegetation index were used in the analysis. The aircraft measurements corroborated the ground measurements inasmuch as wheat stand densities were detected and could be evaluated at an early enough growth stage to make management decision. The aircraft measurements also corroborated handheld measurements when related to yield prediction. The IR/red ratio, although there was some growth stage dependency, related well to yield when measured from just past tillering until about the watery-ripe stage.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19830004222, "id": "906de702a37c485489a59d6a1ab09200", "publicationDate": "1982-06-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19830004222.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19830004222/downloads/19830004222.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19830004222/downloads/19830004222.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19830004222/downloads/19830004222.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
