An embodiment utilizes\none or more latex surgical tubes with a predetermined outer\ndiameter (OD). In another embodiment, depending on the\ninitial launch condition requirements, the OD for the latex\nsurgical tubes may be scaleable. This scalability may also\nresult in scaling the dimensions of other elements of the\napparatus (e.g., the elongated tracks, carrier, combinations\nof elements, all of the elements, etc.). With reference to FIG.\n2, a third embodiment may utilize five latex surgical tubes of\n0.625 inches OD latex surgical tubes attached to two mount- io\ning plates 9,lO of rigid material (for example, a metal). In\nan embodiment, the means for propelling has two ends\nwherein connecting the means for propelling to each mounting plate 9.10 may be accomplished by a capture screw 13\nsecured by a tie device 14 within both ends of the means for 15\nProPelbng as Partially illustrated in FIG. 9. Multiple\nembodiments exist for the tie device 14, for example a wire\n(as illustrated in FIG. 9 3 a clip (not shown), or a clamp (not\n1\nthe means for Propelling\nshown).

AS illustrated in\nFIG. 2, in an embodiment, two mounting plates (hereinafter 25\nr e f e d to as the first mounting plate 9 and second mounting\nplate 10) may be required for each set of one or more capture\nscrews 13. In this embodiment, the first set of one or more\ncapture screws 13 may be attached to the first mounting plate\n9 and the second set of one or more capture screws 13 may 30\nbe attached to the second mounting plate 10. Further, one\nend of the one or more latex surgical tubes may be attached\nto the first set of the one or more capture screws 13.\nSecondly, the other end of the one or more latex surgical\ntubes 7 may be attached to the second set of the one or more 35\ncapture screws 13. Thirdly, the first set of one or more tie\ndevices 14 may be wrapped around one end of the one or\nmore latex surgical tubes 7 to secure the one end to the 6rst\nset of the one or more capture screws 13. Finally, the second\nset of one or more tie devices 14 may be wrapped around the\nother end of the one or more latex surgical tubes 7 to secure\nthe other end to the second set of the one or more capture\nscrews 13. In an embodiment, the first mounting plate 9 may\nbe adjustably attached to the track system 4. Use of the first\nmounting plate 9, the first set of one or more capture screws\nW, and the first set of one or more tie devices 14 indepen- 45\ndently or in any combination represents one means to\nadjustably attached one end of the means for propelling\nrelative to the track system 4. As illustrated in FIG. 2, in an\nembodiment, the second mounting plate 10 may be connected to a first cable 11, which is described in more detail 50\nbelow. The use of a first cable 11, second mounting plate 10,\nsecond set of one or more capture screws 13, and second set\nof one or more tie devices 14 independently or in any\ncombinationrepresents one second means for connecting the\nmeans for propelling to the carrier. In an embodiment, the 55\nfirst cable 11 may be permanently or temporarily a x e d to\nthe carrier 5. The attachment of the means for propelling to\nthe track system 4 may be at any point, but it is recognized\nthat if this attachment is as far aft as possible relative to the\ntrack system 4, then this location maximizes the potential\nenergy storage and acceleration length. In addition; attachment of the means for propelling to the track system 4 may\nbe adjustable in a longitudinal manner thereby providing a\nmeans to vary the amount of potential energy necessary to\nlaunch aircraft of varying mass. In another embodiment, an\nultraviolet or \xe2\x80\x9cUV\xe2\x80\x9d coating 39 as illustrated in FIG. 2 may 65\nbe applied to the latex surgical tubes to protect the latex\nsurgical tubes from UV induced degradation.\n\n6\nWith continued reference to FIG. 1, FIG. 2, FIG. 3, and\nFIG. 4, in an embodiment, a manually driven winch system\n16, pulley 17, first cable 11, and second cable 18, may be\nused to move the carrier 5 into a launch position. In another\nembodiment, a motor driven winch system is used. As stated\nearlier, the first cable 11 is part of a second means for\nconnecting the means for propelling to the carrier 5. Moving\nthe carrier 5 to the launch position increases the potential\nenergy of the means for propelling the carrier longitudinally\nalong the track system 4.

In this manner, a downward force is applied to\nminimize movement of the track system 4 as a result of the\nlaunching process. n u s , the container 34 may serve two\nfunctions. The container\xe2\x80\x99s 34 primary function is to stow the\napparatus in its retracted configuration for easy transport. 35\nThe container may also serve as the weight 33 to minimize\nthe movement of the track system 4 during an actual launch.\nWith continued reference to FIG. 1and FIG. 3, as well as\nreference to FIG. 15, an energy absorption barrier 35 may be\nused to absorb excess kinetic energy remaining at the end of 40\nthe launch sequence. In an embodiment, an energy absorbing material 36 may be sandwiched between two barrier\nplates 37, 38 to form the barrier 35. In an embodiment, the\nbarrier 35 may be installed at the end of one of the elongated\ntracks. The two barrier plates of rigid material 37,38 may be 45\nselected from a group consisting of metal, wood, plastic, and\ngraphite. In one embodiment, the two barrier plates may be\ncomprised of aluminum. The energy absorbing material may\nbe selected from a group consisting of polyurethane, a\nvisco-elastic polymer. and foam. For the purposes h a i n , 50\nfoam is defined as any of various light, porous, semi-rigid or\nspongy materials. For the purposes herein, visco-elastic is\ndefined as any material the exhibits properties of both\nliquids (viscous solutions) and solids (elastic materials).\nThe\nas described above has\nbasic confi@- 55\nFIG. 1)\nrations: the extended configuration (illustrated in3). In the\nand the\nconfiguration\nin\nextended configuration, the track system 4 is folded outward\nto its full length and may be interlocked. In the retracted\nconfiguration, the track system 4 is folded inward where it\nmay be interlocked and compactly stored in a backpack or\nother container.\nMultiple methods exist for using the various embodiments described above. With reference to FIGS. 1,2,3 and\n8, for example, in one method, the user un-stows the\napparatus from the container 34 and extends as well as\ninterlocks the track system 4, comprised of two elongated\ntracks, to its full length. The locking plate 49 is used to lock\n\n65\n\nthe two elongated tracks together. The user then uses the\nbi-pod stand 27 to elevate and aid in the securing of the track\nsystem 4 in its fully extended configuration at a predetermined angle relative to a surface. The user then uses rocks\nor other heavy material on top of the first cord 29 attached\nto the bi-pod stand 27 to help secure the track system 4 to\nthe surface. The user next secures the container 34 to the\nsecond cord 32, which is attached to one of the elongated\ntracks and subsequently is used as a weight 33. After the\ntrack system 4 is secured to the surface, it is ready for\noperation. The user temporarily secures the second cable 18\nvia the attached spherical bearing 53 to the cable catch 54\nand then moves the carrier 5 to the launch position via a\nmanually driven winch system 16, pulley 17, first cable 1 ,\n1\nand second cable 18 thereby extending the means for\npropelling the carrier, which herein in this embodiment\ncomprises a multiplicity Of latex Surgical tubes 7. The carrier\n5 is locked i a launch position by the trigger 28, which is\nn\nn\nself-actuating The user employs the Safety Pin 42 i its\npredetermined location to ensure an unintentional launch\ndoes not occur. The user next temporarily attaches the\naircraft 8 to the adapter 6, which is temporarily secured to\nthe carrier 5. When the user is ready to launch the aircraft 8,\nthe user will remove the safety pin 42 as well as the second\ncable 18 from the cable catch 54 and then release the trigger\n28. The subsequently Co~version stored potential energy\nof\nto kinetic energy i the multiplicity of latex surgical tubes 7\nn\npropels the carrier 5 along the track system 4. At the end of\nthe launch sequence,the Carrier 5 impacts the energy adsorption barrier 35 and the aircraft 8 is launched. After the\naircraft 8 is launched, the user removes the rocks or other\nheavy material on top of the first cord 29 and de-attaches the\nCmtainer 34 from the second cord 32. The user then\ndisengages the locking plate 49 to unlock the two elongated\ntracks. The user next retracts the apparatus, prepares the\napparatus for stowage, and stows the apparatus i the\nn\ncontainer 34.\nThe corresponding structures, materials, acts, and equivalents of all means or step plus function elements in the\nclaims below are intended to include any structure, material,\nO acts for P~rfonning functions in combination with\nr\nthe\nOther claimed elements as specifically claimed.\nThe embodiment of the apparatus described herein are\nonly for purposes of illustration and understanding of the\napparatus.
