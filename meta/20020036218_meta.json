During this time, Cisco Systems developed the mobile-router which NASA and Cisco jointly tested. The early field trials of this technology have been successfully completed. The mobile-router is software code that resides in a network router. A Mobile-Router allows entire networks to roam while maintaining connectivity to the Internet. This router code is pertinent to a myriad of applications for both the government and commercial sectors. This technology will be applied to the wireless battlefield. NASA and the Department of Defense will utilize this technology for near-planetary observation and sensing spacecraft. It is the enabling technology for communication via the Internet or Intranets to aircraft. Information such as weather, air traffic control, voice and video can be easily and inexpensively transmitted to the aircraft using Internet protocols. The mobile router can be incorporated into emergency vehicles particularly ambulances and life-flight aircraft to provide real-time connectivity back to the hospital and healthcare experts. Commercial applications include entertainment services, IP telephone, and Internet connectivity for cruise ships, commercial shipping, tour busses, aircraft, and eventually cars. This paper will briefly describe the mobile router operation. An upcoming wide area network field test with application to US Coast Guard communications will be described. The paper will also highlight military and government networks that will benefit from the deployment of mobile router and the associated applications.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20020036218, "endDate": "2001-10-31T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers", "location": "United States"}}, "meetingId": "9c2ac290f31d4d1d8f6aae98d1ac0e26", "id": "59ccc0e1ff164cd5ba45cdb6e18d853b"}], "name": "MILCOM 2001", "location": "Vienna, VA", "id": "9c2ac290f31d4d1d8f6aae98d1ac0e26", "startDate": "2001-10-28T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20020036218, "id": "a35346652788463790f246ceb439d37f", "publicationDate": "2002-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20020036218.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20020036218/downloads/20020036218.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20020036218/downloads/20020036218.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20020036218/downloads/20020036218.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
