Harris,\n\nSr.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nAltitude information is very important to pilots.\nAlthough on the\ninstrument landing approach, pilots only look at the altimeter 3% to 6% of the\ntime, they obtain relative altitude information from glideslope and command bar\nneedles.\nOne pilot questionnaire survey has indicated that altimeters are\nmisread by almost all pilots.\nCommercial pilot eye scanning data previously\ncollected were reanalyzed to evaluate how pilots used the drum pointer altimeter.\nThe results of these tests showed that the pilots seldom used the drum window\napparently because it was difficult to read as indicated by average drum window\ndwell times of .6 seconds.\nIt is suggested that pilot scanning data be collected\nfor other types of altimeters in order to find those with good scanning\ncharacteristics.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nAltitude is one of the prime bits of information needed by a pilot during\nany phase of flight.\nMisreading of the altimeter can result in incidents and\naccidents.\nConsequently, a number of altimeter designs have been tried over\nthe years.\nThe tests conducted and the reports written on the subject are\nnumerous; in fact, a number of summary reports have been written such as\nreferences i and 2. In 1975, A. N. Du Feu (ref. 3) wrote that "the altimeter\nis one of the most important aircraft instruments and is likely to remain so\nfor many years to come.\nIt is pertinent, therefore, to attempt to forecast\nwhat the future holds for this instrument."\nIn summarizing he wrote "no great\nchange is foreseen in display presentation\nof altimeters, the counter pointer\ntype will become universal except for low performance,\nlow altitude aircraft.\nSolid state displays are likely to supplant mechanical displays, but still with\nan imitation of mechanical displays.\nIt is possible that the advent of CRT\npresentation will result in presentations\nof optimum displays for each phase of\nflight, but still there is no sign of an acceptable completely new presentation\non the horizon."\nEven though no completely new presentation is forecast, the\ncurrent altimeter designs are not totally adequate as evidenced by the number\nof accidents, near accidents, and incidents due to pilots misreading altimeters.\nThis paper will discuss an analysis of pilot scanning characteristics\nof a\ndrum pointer altimeter.\nCorrelations will be made to past research on altimeters\nin an effort to understand how a pilot uses an altimeter.\nAlso, suggestions to\nhelp improve the readability of the altimeters thereby reducing the number of\nmisreads will be discussed.\nUse of trade names or names of manufacturers\nin this report does not\nconstitute an official endorsement of such products or manufacturers,\neither\nexpressed or implied, by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.\n\nEQUIPMENT AND TEST PROCEDURE\n\nThe tests were performed in a Boeing 737 simulator at Piedmont Airline\'s\nTraining Facility.\nThe simulator is FAA certified and used for initial and\nrecurrent training.\nThe only change in the instrument panel was the\nincorporation of an oculometer optical head which was mounted below the\nAutomatic Direction Finder (ADF) behind the instrument panel.\nA TV camera\nwas mounted behind the pilot to view the instrument panel and a TV monitor was\nlocated behind the pilot\'s seat to allow the test conductor to observe the\npilot lookpoints superimposed on the instrument panel scene.\nThe oculometer has two primary subsystems:\nthe electro-optical\nsystem\nand the signal processing unit.\nThe electro-optical\nsystem mounted in the\ninstrument panel generates a beam of infrared light which is directed through\na beam splitting mirror toward the subject\'s eye. Reflections\nfrom the eye are\ndirected back through the beam-splitter\nto an infrared-sensitive\nTV camera.\nThe high reflectivity\nof the human retina for infrared leads to a backlighting\nof the pupil, so that the camera sees the pupil of the eye as a bright, circular\narea (fig. I).\nThe camera also sees a small bright spot due to a reflection\nfrom the corneal surface.\nThe relative positions of the center of the pupil\nand the corneal reflection depend on the angle of rotation of the eyeball with\nrespect to the infrared beam.\nThe signal processing unit uses the signal from\nthe TV camera to compute this angle of rotation and the coordinates of the\nlookpoint on the instrument panel.\nThe output of the signal processor is a\nset of calibrated analog signals representing the subject\'s lookpoint coordinates\nand pupil diameter.\nA complete description of the oculometer and test situation\ncan be found in reference 4.\nAll landing approaches were started at 19 km (12 miles) from runway\nthreshold and approximately\n415 m (1360 ft) above ground level.\nThe first 6 km\n(4 miles) were used by the pilot to stabilize the aircraft on the correct\nflight path and to check the oculometer calibration.\nAt 13 km (8 miles) data\nrecording was started and continued through capture and descent down the 3\xc2\xb0\nglideslope, touchdown and rollout or until the approach was aborted as a result\nof the pilot choosing to go around.\nAll airline pilots used in the program were qualified Boeing 737 pilots\nwho fly regularly for a scheduled airline.\nThe pilots were asked to assume that\nthey were flying an aircraft full of passengers, and if they would normally\nelect to go around, they should do so. All tests were conducted using the same\nco-pilot.\nThe co-pilot functioned in the same manner as he would in a normal\napproach and provided all required call outs.\n\nREVI_\n\nOF PILOT OPINION\n\nAND SELECTED\n\nALTIMETER\n\nRESEARCH\n\nIf altimeter display improvements are to be accomplished and if optimum\naltimeter displays are to be developed for future flight systems, it becomes\nimperative that we understand the problems with existing altimeters and how\na pilot obtains and perceives altitude information.\n\nDrum\n\nPointer\n\nAltimeter\n\nMisreads\n\nA survey was conducted by Jim Anderson, National Airline Control Safety\nChairman, through the Airline Pilots Association to ascertain the percentage of\nNational Airline pilots who have misread or observed another pilot misread the\ndrum pointer altimeter used in National Airline\'s B727 aircraft.\nThe results\nof the survey indicated that of the 169 pilots who responded, 137 stated that\nthey had misread the altimeter and 134 stated that they had observed another\npilot misread the altimeter (85% of each group stated that such observations\nhad been made on more than one occasion).\nThe survey results also indicate\nthat a surprisingly large number of misreads (50) happen during the approach\nphase.\nSeveral comments of pilots relating to the drum pointer altimeter are:\ni.\n\n"This altimeter takes more concentration\nnecessary to read accurately."\n\n2.\n\n"The small drum window is a complication on the instrument and\n(is) quite small, often requiring a \'double look\' and diverting\nattention from the needle.\nOther instruments require only a\nsingle point of visual attention to comprehend and do not\ndivert, slow, or complicate a smoothly flowing scan."\n\n3.\n\n"Misreads\nattention\n\nseemed to always occur at the lower\nis split between more activities."\n\n4.\n\n"The more\n\nstressful\n\n5.\n\n"A quick glance after (being distracted) can usually induce a\nreading of 1,000 ft. off if the barrel drum is halfway between\nthousands."\n\nPilot\n\nsituations\n\nOpinion\n\nproduced\n\nof Altitude\n\nthan\n\nshould be\n\naltitude when\n\nmore misreads."\n\nImportance\n\nPilots normally rate the altimeter as the third most looked at instrument\nin the aircraft (with the Flight Director being first and the airspeed\nindicator second).\nIn fact, when asked, some pilots stated they spent 20 to\n25% of their time on the altimeter.\nStudies conducted using these same pilots\n(ref. 4) indicate that for all test conditions they actually spent an average\nof between 3 to 6% of their time looking at the altimeters.\nThe discrepancy\nbetween pilot opinion and actual time spent on the altimeter may not be as\nbad as it seems at first glance.\nIndications are that while the pilot may in\nfact be concerned about his altitude 25% of the time, it does not equate to\nspending that much time looking at the altimeter.\nOn the straight and level\nportion of the approach, once having established his altitude, the pilot can\nuse either the horizontal command bar of the Flight Director to indicate\nposition with respect to desired altitude or other cues which indicate that a\nchange in altitude is taking place.\nUpon starting the descent, additional\ninstruments also provide altitude information.\nTo quote a NASA test pilot,\n"On the glideslope the altimeter is all but relegated to a back up mode.\nMy\n\n3\n\nsources of information are first the raw glideslope data, second, command bars,\nand third, where present, co-pilot call outs."\nWhile the first two do not\ngive absolute altitude information they do tell the pilot where he is with\nrespect to his desired altitude at that point in his approach.\nTherefore,\nwhile a pilot may in fact spend up to 25% of his time concerned with altitude\ninformation, it is not necessary, however, that he spend all of that time\nlooking at the altimeter.\n\nAltimeter\n\nResearch\n\nA number of different altimeters are used in current commercial aircraft\nsuch as the three pointer, counter pointer, drum pointer, and counter drum\npointer (fig. 2).\nThe altimeter used in the current study was a drum_\npointer (fig. 2b).\nThe pointer indicates altitude over a I000 ft (305 m) range\nwhile the drum indicates thousands and tens of thousands of feet.\nOne of the\nmost comprehensive\nstudies of time required to read the various types of\naltimeters\n(fig. 2) is reported in reference 5. In these tests, the subjects\nwere required to read altimeter settings while engaged in a central tracking\ntask.\nAt random times, the experimenter would open a shutter which was\ncovering the altimeter.\nThe subject would read the altimeter, operate a hand\nswitch to close the shutter and then report the altitude to the nearest\ni00 ft (30.5 m).\nMeasurements were taken of the altimeter exposure time and\nthe accuracy of reporting the altitude.\nEighteen pilots participated\nin the\nstudy.\nA total of 15 altimeter exposure trials were performed on each of\nthe four types of altimeters (similar to those of fig. 2). The results\nfor the drum pointer altimeter (equivalent to the one used in the airline\npilot study) showed a mean exposure time of 1.38 seconds with a probability\nof an error of 2.4%.\nIn those tests, the pilot was presented with a\nrandom selection of altitudes so that no history of altitude profile could\nbe maintained;\nconsequently, the subject pilots were required to read the\nentire altimeter each time it was shown.\n\nRESULTS\n\nAND DISCUSSION\n\nIn an actual flight situation, altimeter readings are not presented to\npilots in a random fashion.\nIn fact, the pilot has a continuing altitude\nprofile which provides a running time history; consequently, he has a prior\nknowledge of what to expect when he looks at the altimeter and therefore,\ndoes not have to read the entire altimeter each time he looks at the instrument.\nIn fact, both reference 4 and reference 6 indicate that pilots when flying\nsimulated approaches have an altimeter mean dwell time of only between .3 to\n.4 seconds as opposed to the 1.38 seconds found in reference 5. In addition,\nobservation\nof the real time TV tapes, taken during the airline pilot study\n(ref. 4), shows that the pilot looked at the left side of the altimeter even\nthough the needle was pointing to the right side.\nThis observation coupled\nwith the large standard deviation of mean dwell time found in the data led to\na reanalysis of the altimeter data in terms of dwell times for the left side,\nright side, and altimeter drum window.\nFor the above analysis, the altimeter\n\n4\n\nwas divided into three areas:\nthe left side, the right side, and the altitude\ndrum window.\nThe left and right side divided the altimeter in half from top\nto bottom with no overlap.\nThe drum window, however, overlapped a very small\npart of the left side and part of the right side (fig. 3).\nFigure 4 presents\na combined dwell time histogram of the frequency distribution of individual\ndwells on the total altimeter.\nThese data were taken from seven pilots who\nperformed a total of 108 simulated ILS approaches from 13 km (8 miles) out to\ni00 ft (30.5 m) above the runway.\nThe abscissa is dwell time in seconds plotted\non a log scale; the ordinate is percent of the total number of looks at the\naltimeter.\nThe curve shows a mode at about .25 seconds with a median at .275\nseconds and mean of .32 seconds.\nThe next figure (fig. 5) presents a break\nout of the dwells on the left and right sides of the altimeter.\nThis shows a\ncharacteristic\ndifference in the dwells on the right and left sides.\nThe left\nside dwells show a distribution with two peaks, one at about .i seconds and a\nsecond at about .4 seconds.\nReference 7 refers to a bimodal dwell distribution\nas being a characteristic\nof a type II instrument and defined the peaks\noccurring at these same dwell times as glance (.i sec) and read (.4 sec) dwells.\nFor the short dwell times the pilot gets only minimal information such as the\ndirection of needle orientation.\nThe longer dwell times are associated with\nreading the needle value.\nDuring the approximately 180 seconds required for\nan approach the needle is on the left side for only 40 or 50 seconds (on the\naverage 25% of the time).\nYet, the pilot spends approximately\n48% of the time\nin the altimeter on the left side.\nIt is hypothesized that the pilot can\ndetermine right side needle position and/or rate parafoveally while fixated on\nthe left side of the altimeter.\nThe right side of the altimeter shows a totally\ndifferent shape with a single mode at .25 seconds.\nReference 7 refers to a\nsingle peaked dwell distribution as a type one instrument with the pilot\nreading only the value to which the needle was pointing.\nOf particular interest, on the right side of the altimeter, is the window\nwhich contains the drum.\nThe data were analyzed for dwell times in the area of\nthe drum window (fig. 3) plus \xc2\xbd of a visual degree (_ inch) surrounding the\nwindow.\nWhen the pilot looks in the drum area and the needle is overlapping the\ndrum area, it is difficult to determine which piece of information he is\nreading.\nFigure 6 gives the dwell time histogram for the dr_ window area.\nThese data show a broad peak between .i to .25 seconds.\nThis broad peak could\nbe a summation of a distribution having a peak at about .i seconds (glances)\nand one having a peak at .25 seconds.\nReference 8 presents the dwell time\nhistogram of subjects during text reading.\nThe text reading data also peak\nat .25 seconds and have a shape that appears to be log normally distributed.\nTo obtain an estimate of what dwell distribution remains when the text reading\n(in this case assumed to be needle position reading) is removed, the distribution\nof reference 8 was subtracted from that of figure 6. The resulting curves are\nplotted in figure 7- The middle curve is the one subtracted (ref. 8) and the\nremaining distribution forms the left and right curves.\nThe one to the left is\nalmost\nidentical in distribution to the glances of reference 7 and is\nprobably associated with needle direction estimation.\nThe distribution on the\nright appears to be log normally distributed with a peak between .5 and .6\nseconds.\nThere are two possibilities\nto explain the distribution.\nIn followon work, Dr. R. Harris (co-author of this paper) using the general aviation\ndata reported in reference 7, found similar distributions\nat this peak dwell\ntime to be associated with a control input.\nThese data were analyzed for\n\nassociated control inputs (ref. 9) by establishing a control input criterion\nbased on amplitude and rate.\nWhen this criterion was met, the instrument at\nwhich the subject was looking and the dwell time for that look were determined.\nThese data, however, were not found to be associated with control input.\nIn fact, no altimeter looks occurred within .75 seconds of a control input.\nThe second possible explanation of the dwell distribution peaking at .5 to .6\nseconds is that these are the dwells in which the pilot was reading the altitude\ndigits in the drum window.\nIf these are associated with the pilot reads of\nthe drum, then two implications can be drawn.\nFirst, the number of times that\nthe altitude window is actually read is very small (approximately 3.0% of all\naltimeter dwells).\nSecond, the peak occurring at .5 to .6 seconds is a display\ndesign concern since this is almost twice as long as text reading.\nThe longer time could either be because of digit size (the digits are the\nminimum size recommended in ref. i0)or\nit could be that reading the drum\nrequires the pilot to interpolate between the i000 ft (305 m) digits showing (see\nfig. 2b) or a combination of both factors.\nIn any case, numbers presented on\na counter which steps between thousands of feet altitude should reduce the total\nread time, as the pilot has only one set of digits to evaluate.\nThis is what\napparently helped reduce the reading times (reported in ref. 5) of the drum\npointer from 1.38 sec. to .8 sec. for counter pointer altimeter.\nIt would seem\nlogical to make the counter digits as large as possible and place them on the\nleft of the altimeter.\nThis is the location where the pilots look most often.\n\nCONCLUDING\n\nREMARKS\n\nWhile the drum pointer altimeter may not be the best available, all\naltimeters share to some degree the same problems.\nAdditional research in\nexactly how and why pilots glance, read, and scan altimeters should lead to\nbetter instrument design and consequently enhance safety in both commercial\nand general aviation aircraft.\n_ile\neach pilot has an individual scan pattern which changes with\ninstrument layout, aircraft, and flight conditions the basic time required\nextract the desired components of information should be fairly constant\nacross conditions for an instrument like the altimeter.\nThe results\n\npresented\n\nhere\n\naltimeter\n\nindicate\n\nthat:\n\nmisreads\n\nby pilots\n\ni.\n\nDrum pointer\n\nare fairly\n\n2.\n\nIt requires several fixations within the drum pointer\nto get all the information available.\n\ncommon.\naltimeter\n\nto\n\n3.\n\nThe pilot can pick up relative\nin a quick glance (.I sec.).\n\nneedle\n\nposition\n\n(right or left)\n\n4.\n\nThe total time spent looking at the altimeter\nsmall, 3% of the dwells within the altimeter,\nrequire 0.5 to 0.6 sec to read the drum.\n\n5.\n\nAdditional scan research with tests specifically designed\nto look at altimeter design and use is needed to properly\ndevelop and evaluate future altimeters.\n\ndrum is very\nand pilots\n\n_\'_\n\nAt this point, several improvements are indicated; first, to increase\nthe size of the drum numbers, second, use a counter or counter/drum combination\nand third, place it where the pilot looks most often (on the left side of the\naltimeter).\nSome of these improvements have already been incorporated in\nsome of the newer altimeters.\nResearch using these newer altimeters is needed\nto determine if in fact they do allow the pilots to extract the needed\ninformation quickly and accurately.\n\nLangley Research Center\nNational Aeronautics\nand Space Administration\nHampton, VA 23665\nMarch 1981\n\n7\n\nREFERENCES\ni.

Abstract\n\nAltitude informationis very importantto pilots. Althoughon the instrumentlanding approachpilots only look at the altimeter3 to 6 percentof the time, they\nobtain relativealtitudeinformationfrom glideslopeand commandbar needles. One\npilot questionnairesurveyhas indicatedthat altimetersare misread by almost all\npilots. Commercialpilot eye scanningdata previouslycollectedwere reanalyzed\nto evaluatehow pilots used the drum pointeraltimeter. The resultsof these tests\nshowed that the pilots seldom used the drum windowapparentlybecause it was difficult to read as indicatedby averagedrum windowdwell times of 0.6 sec. It is\nsuggestedthat pilot scanningdata be collectedfor other types of altimetersin\norder to find those with good scanningcharacteristics.\n\ni7.\n\nKey Words\n\n(Suggested by Author(s))\n\n18.
