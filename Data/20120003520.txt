These same qualities are as critical,\nif not more so, in the operation of spacecraft.\n\nThe requirement that manual control be provisioned is\ncodified in NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Human-Rating Requirements for Space\nSystems [3]. Under Item 3.4.1, \xe2\x80\x9cThe crewed space system\nshall provide the capability for the crew to manually control\nthe flight path and attitude of their spacecraft...\xe2\x80\x9d This\nrequirement was established as \xe2\x80\x9ca fundamental element of\ncrew survival. Manual control means that the crew can\nbypass the automated guidance of the vehicle to interface\ndirectly with the flight control system to effect any flight\npath within the capability of the flight control system.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nA research, development, test, and evaluation process was put\ninto effect to identify, understand, and interpret the\nengineering and human factors principles which govern the\npilot-vehicle dynamic system as they pertain to space\nexploration missions and tasks. Toward this objective, piloted\nsimulations were conducted at the NASA Langley Research\nCenter and Ames Research Center for earth-orbit proximity\noperations and docking and lunar landing.\nThese works provide broad guidelines for the design of\nspacecraft to exhibit excellent handling characteristics. In\nparticular, this work demonstrates how handling qualities\ninclude much more than just stability and control\ncharacteristics of a spacecraft or aircraft. Handling qualities\nare affected by all aspects of the \xe2\x80\x9cpilot-vehicle dynamic\nsystem,\xe2\x80\x9d including the motion, visual and aural cues of the\nvehicle response as the pilot performs the required operation\nor task. A holistic approach to spacecraft design, including the\nuse of manual control, automatic control, and pilot\nintervention/supervision is described. The handling qualities\nimplications of design decisions are demonstrated using these\npilot-in-the-loop evaluations of docking operations and lunar\nlandings.\n\nFurther, under Item 3.4.2, \xe2\x80\x9cthe crewed spacecraft shall\nexhibit Level 1 handling qualities (Handling Qualities\nRating (HQR) 1, 2 and 3), as defined by the Cooper-Harper\nRating Scale, during manual control of the spacecraft's\nflight path and attitude.\xe2\x80\x9d The primary rationale is that Level\n1 handling qualities will allow the crew to effectively\ncontrol the spacecraft when necessary for mission\ncompletion or to prevent a catastrophic event.\nThese requirements are sufficient motivation to properly\nattend to the design of inherently good spacecraft handling\nqualities. However, the depth and breadth implicit in these\nrequirements is not often appreciated.\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nHandling qualities are not defined only by the control\nsystem design characteristics of the vehicle; they also\ninclude the motion, visual and aural cues of the vehicle\nresponse. This influence spans across the design of the\nmanual and automatic control modes, cockpit displays,\ncontrol inceptors (e.g., tactile cueing), crew station design,\ncrew resources management (including mission control) and\nmission operations.\n\n1.

Spacecraft\nhandling qualities research is described which highlight the\nimplications of handling qualities on spacecraft design and\noperations and capture pertinent lessons-learned for future\nvehicles, including commercial crew vehicles.\n\n1. INTRODUCTION\nHandling qualities embody those qualities or characteristics\nof a vehicle that govern the ease and precision with which a\nU.S. Government work not protected by U.S. copyright\n\n1\n\nplatforms as well as all future NASA and other government\nagency and commercial spacecraft.\n\n2. BACKGROUND\nHandling qualities are illustrated using the concept of the\n\xe2\x80\x9cpilot-vehicle dynamic system\xe2\x80\x9d (Figure 1); the elements of\nwhich form a closed-loop system, driven by a piloting task\nor mission objective. The pilot acts as the system controller.\nThe pilot\xe2\x80\x99s role is to serve as \xe2\x80\x9cthe decision-maker of what is\nto be done, the comparator of what\xe2\x80\x99s happening vs. what he\nwants to happen, and the supplier of corrective inputs to the\naircraft controls to achieve what he desires\xe2\x80\x9d [4].\n\nThis work was spurred on, in part, by the legacy established\nby Gemini and Apollo where significant research was\nconducted for the parametric investigation of what drives\nspacecraft handling qualities. The Apollo and Gemini work\ninvestigated, for example, the handling qualities influence of\nsuch parameters as:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nStress\n\nExternal Disturbances Turbulence\nWind / X-Wind\n\nAural\nCues\n\nControl\nForce\n\nTask\nPilot\n\nMotion\nCues\n\nCockpit\nFeel\nSystem\n\nControl\nCommand\n\nAugmented\nAircraft\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nAircraft\nResponse\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nVisual\nCues\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\nFigure 1: Pilot-Vehicle Dynamic System [4]\n\nSpacecraft attitude control mode, control power, target\nlighting and target oscillatory motion [6, 7];\n\xe2\x80\x9cRemote\xe2\x80\x9d docking using closed-circuit television [8];\nVisual aids, in day and night conditions, to align to a\ndocking target [9];\nHand controllers, instruments, and control modes [10];\nVisual simulation compared to \xe2\x80\x9cfull-size\xe2\x80\x9d docking [11];\nVisual aids and attitude control modes in lunar orbit\n[12];\nHandling qualities design requirements and control law\ntypes for lunar landing [13,14].\n\nFor Apollo and Gemini, this work was critical since\nexperience for the required spacecraft operations was nonexistent.\n\nHandling qualities reflect the precision with which the pilot\ncan accomplish the given task (as the controller of the\nclosed-loop system) and the associated pilot workload and\ncompensation to meet this level of performance. Although\nthe \xe2\x80\x9caugmented aircraft\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 the vehicle\xe2\x80\x99s dynamic response\ncharacteristics augmented by its flight control system \xe2\x80\x93\nwould logically be the primary determinant of handling\nqualities, the other system factors may be equally\ninfluential. These cues (such as the presence or absence of\nmotion cues and the environment, e.g., external visibility,\ncontrol upsets, aural cues, and pilot stressors) are the\nfeedbacks that the pilot uses to perceive the vehicle response\nand meet the demands of the task.\n\nOne could argue that a wealth of data and experience are at\nhand today so new work in spacecraft handling qualities is\nnot needed. The counter argument is that there is not a\nsufficient basis from which to extrapolate to new vehicles,\noperations, and operating conditions and mission plans. As\nan example, when the Space Shuttle was being developed,\nproximity operations and docking issues were assumed to be\na lower priority (i.e., had less technical risk) compared to\nother system development tasks because of the Apollo and\nGemini legacy [15]. This lack of initial concern for\nproximity operations and docking resulted in \xe2\x80\x9ccomplex\noperational work-arounds over the life of the [Shuttle]\nprogram.\xe2\x80\x9d Stepping back and fully considering the past is\nthe only way to avoid reliving history.\n\nModifications or changes in individual elements within this\nclosed-loop system may be compensated by the adaptive\npilot, but possibly at a cost of pilot workload or changes in\ntask performance. These effects cannot be segregated; thus,\nhandling qualities must really be evaluated in the aggregate\n[4,5]. Empirical and historical data can provide perspective\nand estimates on the effects of changing elements within the\nsystem but the only truly accurate measure is to evaluate the\naggregate closed-loop system.\n\nTo avoid reliving this past, a research, development, test,\nand evaluation process was initiated to identify, understand,\nand interpret the engineering and human factors principles\nwhich govern the pilot-vehicle dynamic system (i.e.,\nhandling qualities) as they pertain to space exploration\nmissions and tasks for Constellation and all future NASA\nand other government agency and commercial spacecraft.\n\nSpacecraft Handling Qualities\nOur foundational understanding of handling qualities (HQ)\nand the pilot-vehicle dynamic system is rooted in the\naeronautics domain. Although the physics of the systems are\nobviously different, the fundamentals are no different and of\nno less importance for spacecraft.\n\n3. PROXIMITY OPERATIONS AND DOCKING\nThe Spacecraft Handling Qualities work initially\ninvestigated proximity operations and docking issues,\nprincipally focused around two human-in-the-loop\nexperiments each, conducted at both the Ames Research\nCenter (ARC) and Langley Research Center (LaRC).\nSubsequent to this work, additional activity was conducted\nat NASA Johnson Manned Space Flight Center, focused\n\nThe National Aeronautics and Space Administration\n(NASA) initiated a multi-centered Spacecraft Handling\nQualities project in 2007. This project was designed to\nprovide data and guidelines for the design, development,\ntest, and evaluation of NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Constellation Program\n2\n\nspecifically on Orion/Crew Exploration Vehicle handling\nqualities investigations [16].\n\nDesired and Adequate Performance Standards\nEqually critical to the task definition are the required task\nperformance standards. The performance standards must be:\na) germane to the required operation or task as they apply to\nthe actual mission; b) include variables or outcomes\ncontrollable by the pilot; c) observable to the pilot; and, d)\nsufficiently demanding that high closed-loop pilot-vehicle\n\xe2\x80\x9ctask bandwidth\xe2\x80\x9d is required to aptly stress and test the\nhandling qualities characteristics [2].\n\nThese works revealed numerous design implications and\ndesign guidance which capture the influence of handling\nqualities on a spacecraft design for proximity operations and\ndocking.\nPiloting Task\nA complete task definition is required, not just of the\nprimary control task, but also of any critical auxiliary tasks.\nFor proximity operations and docking, it was repeatedly\nstressed by Shuttle commanders that the docking task is a\ncrew effort. Delegation of tasks across the crew was\nrequired. In lieu of this - for our single pilot evaluations automation was added to replicate some of these crew\nfunctions, such as using a \xe2\x80\x9crange to docking\xe2\x80\x9d automated\ncall-out. Task analysis should be conducted to appropriately\ndefine the \xe2\x80\x9ccomplete\xe2\x80\x9d piloting task; otherwise, false or\nmisleading assessments may result.\n\nOnce the task is defined, ensuring that closed-loop control\nby the pilot is required, the \xe2\x80\x9ctask bandwidth\xe2\x80\x9d is modulated\nby: 1) the precision that is demanded of the pilot-vehicle\nperformance; and, 2) the time to complete the task.\n1) Task Performance\xe2\x80\x94The task precision is dictated by the\nmission. For proximity operations and docking, desired and\nadequate docking performance standards were established\nbased on the anticipated docking hardware, as shown in\nTable 1. The adequate docking standard was defined by the\nsuccessful docking performance limits. Adequate\nperformance means that the task can still be accomplished;\nalbeit, without significant margin for error. On the other\nhand, desired performance means that the task can be\naccomplished with significant margin. Changing the\ndocking method, changes the task and hence, the handling\nqualities issues and design challenges.\n\nThe concept of operations for rendezvous, proximity\noperations and docking, including docking mechanisms, are\nfirst-order influences on handling qualities and the resultant\non-orbit control design. This fact is self-evident because an\nevaluation pilot is rating the vehicle\xe2\x80\x99s handling\ncharacteristics for a given task or mission task element.\nIn conducting handling qualities evaluations, the criticality\nof the designing appropriate tasks cannot be overemphasized. History has shown that latent handling qualities\ndeficiencies are exposed by using piloting tasks that create\n\xe2\x80\x9cstress cases\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x93 those conditions that necessitate closed-loop\ncontrol of the vehicle to achieve the task objective. The task\nshould not be unreasonable, but it is usually one which\nwould not often occur. An example in the aviation domain is\nthe offset landing task. This task is within the capabilities of\nthe aircraft and is \xe2\x80\x9clegal\xe2\x80\x9d to perform, but operationally,\npilots will usually perform a go-around rather than\ncorrecting back to the centerline of the runway in an attempt\nto land. Using this task to evaluate handling qualities\nexposes the pilot-vehicle dynamic system to a high\nbandwidth task for the purposes of exposing potentially\nlatent deficiencies.\n\n2) Time Constraint\xe2\x80\x94A time constraint may be inherent for\ncertain tasks. If it is not naturally part of a task, it must be\nimposed; otherwise, this becomes an uncontrolled variable\nin the task that can result in potentially adverse\nconsequences.\nFor proximity operations and docking, a time constraint was\nestablished by specifying an approach and docking closure\nrate (e.g., 0.1 ft/sec). This closure rate was included as part\nof the desired and adequate performance standards. The\ndesired performance standard was met if the closure rate for\nthe duration of the task was held within \xc2\xb125% of the target\nvalue. The adequate performance standard was within the\nexpected performance limits of the docking mechanism.\nTable 1: Docking Task Performance Standards\n\nIn proximity operations and docking, this same approach\nwas used. The initial condition on a +V-bar docking\napproach to the International Space Station (ISS) was offset\nby 2.5 ft from the docking axis [17,18]. This offset required\nthe evaluation pilot to laterally and vertically reacquire the\ndocking axis. This \xe2\x80\x9cstress case\xe2\x80\x9d was validated as a good HQ\ntask by experienced Shuttle commanders as one that\nstressed closed-loop control without completely diverging\nfrom the concept of operations. Operationally, this task\nmirrors the aviation-domain offset landing task where the\noffset is at the edge of the allowable ISS docking corridor\nthat would likely, but not necessarily, require the vehicle to\nstop the approach and reposition before attempting docking.\n\nDesired\nPerformance\nRadial Offset\n\n\xc2\xb11.5 in\n\n\xc2\xb11.5 to \xc2\xb13.2 in\n\nRoll/Pitch/Yaw\nAngle\n\n\xc2\xb12.0 deg\n\n\xc2\xb12.0 to \xc2\xb13.0 deg\n\nAxial Closure\nRate (0.1 ft/s)\n\n0.075 to 0.125 ft/s\n\n0 to 0.075 ft/s OR\n0.125 to 0.15 ft/s\n\nRadial (Linear)\nRate\n\n\xc2\xb10.0325 ft/s\n\n\xc2\xb10.0325 to\n\xc2\xb10.1125 ft/s\n\nRoll/Pitch/Yaw\n(Angular) Rate\n\n3\n\nAdequate\nPerformance\n\n\xc2\xb10.05 deg/sec\n\n\xc2\xb10.05 to\n\xc2\xb10.15 deg/sec\n\ndispelled any movement toward eliminating this capability.\nTheir experience showed that, while not often used, manual\nrotational control enabled many orbital Shuttle missions.\n\nThe required HQs are thus established by the precision\nwithin which the task must be completed for mission\nsuccess. These standards were based on data relative to the\nanticipated docking mechanisms for Constellation and those\nanticipated for the commercial off-the-shelf platforms [19].\nIf the docking mechanism or operational concepts are\nchanged, the HQ standards and design challenges will also\nchange.\n\nThree Degree-of-Freedom (3 DOF) Control HQs\nThe introduction of rate command/attitude hold (RCAH)\ncontrol laws to maintain spacecraft attitude (allowing the\npilot to perform translational inputs only) can significantly,\nbut not completely obviate rotational coupling effects.\nCoupling effects may still be apparent as the vehicle slices\nthrough the selected attitude hold deadbands [18,19].\n\nHandling Qualities Influences\nOne predominate handling qualities factor in proximity\noperations and docking is the rotational coupling of the\nvehicle due to translational inputs [17,18]. This effect is\nillustrated in Figure 2 using a simplistic example where the\nrelationship between reaction control system (RCS) jet\nlongitudinal location varies with respect to the vehicle\ncenter-of-mass (CM). If the RCS jet is at the same x-axis\n(body) position, translational RCS jet firings pass through\nthe CM and do not introduce spacecraft rotation changes\n(i.e., uncoupled or \xe2\x80\x9cneutral coupling\xe2\x80\x9d). The left- and righthand sketches in Figure 2 place the RCS jets forward or aft\nof the CM x-axis (body) position so translational RCS jet\npair firings introduce either \xe2\x80\x9cadverse\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cproverse\xe2\x80\x9d\nspacecraft rotation changes, respectively. For a\nconfiguration with adverse coupling, a command to translate\nthe vehicle right would cause an initial yaw to the left (as\nviewed through the centerline camera), seemingly counter to\nthe translation command. Conversely, in a case with\nproverse coupling, a command to translate right would\neffect a yaw rotation in the right direction (as viewed\nthrough the centerline camera), but seemingly additive to\nthe translation command. This coupling effect may also\noccur in the lateral translation/yaw rotational axes as well.\n\nAs one pilot observed, the \xe2\x80\x9cvehicle is \xe2\x80\xa6 going to hold\nattitude plus or minus the deadbands, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t feel like\nI\xe2\x80\x99m really in control.\xe2\x80\x9d Pilot compensation was either to: a)\nignore the deadbands (there were cockpit indications of\nimminent deadband-limit RCS firing); b) offset the docking\nalignment in anticipation of a deadband firing; or, c) correct\nfor them immediately when they occur. In either case, a\nhandling qualities penalty is incurred, resulting in a net\nimprovement in HQRs for 3 DOF control, but not \xe2\x80\x9cnightand-day\xe2\x80\x9d differences [17].\nFeedforward Compensation\nPulse-width-modulation-type feedforward compensation can\nactuate RCS firing durations and combinations to reduce\nresidual RCS translation-to-rotational coupling effects\n[20,21].\nPilot-in-the-loop testing vividly demonstrated the benefits of\nthese systems. Feedforward compensation provided Level 1\nHQRs by virtually eliminating translational-rotational\ncoupling effects [20].\nHandling qualities tests were performed with feedforward\ncompensation in both nominal and off-nominal conditions\nsuch as with intentionally introduced inaccuracies or\nimpurities associated with the controller (e.g., by offsetting\nthe CM from the design position, varying the thruster output\nfrom nominal value, etc.). In all cases tested, the\nfeedforward compensator handling qualities were largely\nunaffected [21].\n\nSix Degree-of-Freedom (6 DOF) Control HQs\nRotation coupling effects were investigated during Apollo\nand Gemini and careful RCS design enabled successful\nmanual control of proximity operations and docking.\nThese issues were reevaluated with representative currentday RCS thruster sizes [17]. The HQ data show that desired\nperformance can generally be obtained without coupling,\nbut six degree-of-freedom (6 DOF) control is higher\nworkload and thus, not satisfactory without improvement\n(not Level 1 HQRs). Adequate HQ performance (Level 2\nHQRs) is generally possible within the range of coupling\neffects evaluated. Large pulse widths (minimum RCS jet\nfiring times) and large thruster sizes, coupled with adverse\nrotational coupling can create Level 3 HQRs. Coupling was\ncorrelated (statistically significant) to fuel usage; lower\ncoupling resulted in better HQRs and less fuel being\nexpended in the operation.\n\nFurther failure mode effects testing is needed, however. The\nconcern is the handling qualities \xe2\x80\x9ccliff\xe2\x80\x9d that may be lurking.\nParticular emphasize should include the real-world effects\nof thruster size and cycle times and how these issues\nmanifest themselves into residues from perfect\ncompensation and latencies caused by duration times to\ncomplete the pulse width commands. The hope is that the\ncontrol law compensation will be robust and not prone to\nany catastrophic degradation of handling qualities due to\nthese effects or others.\n\nFor instance, on occasion, the desirability or need for\nmanual rotational (6 DOF) control was questioned;\nhowever, the more senior Shuttle commanders quickly\n\n4\n\nFigure 2: Illustration of Adverse, Neutral, and Proverse Translational-into-Rotational Coupling\n\nBut by far, the preeminent display factor influencing these\nevaluations was the docking camera. Evaluations were not\nflown without the docking camera or with boresight or\nparallax issues, but its critical role in the task/mission was\napparent. The importance of visual aids for docking\nalignment was established in Gemini/Apollo and design\nprovisions were made accordingly [9]. The appropriate\nprovisions must be ensured in future spacecraft designs\neither by redundancy in the event of a camera failure or\nalternate positioning aids.\n\nFuel Consumption\nThe rotational-translational coupling effects influence fuel\nconsumption in two ways. First, fuel consumption is driven\nby the design of a control law compensator that might\nminimize the coupling effects (e.g., RCAH vs. feed-forward\ncontroller). Second, the rotational coupling (i.e., handling\nqualities) affects the number of translational inputs required\nfor the task [20,21]. Larger attitude deadbands for an RCAH\ncontroller uses less fuel in compensating for rotationaltranslational coupling due to translational inputs than\nsmaller deadbands. Analogously, the feedforward\ncompensator uses more fuel than a typical RCAH controller.\nHowever, testing showed that during the task, a properly\ndesigned feedforward controller used less overall fuel than\nan RCAH design because the pilots used fewer translational\ninputs. The predictability of the system and fewer deadband\nfirings resulted in overall less fuel expenditure during the\ntask [20]. The net result is that better handling qualities\ncorresponded to less propellant consumed.\n\nTask Influences\nApollo and Gemini docking used much higher closure rates\nthan the 0.1 ft/sec standard used by Shuttle (nearly an order\nof magnitude). The reasons are many (different docking\nmechanisms and an almost order of magnitude mass\ndifference between Gemini/Apollo and Shuttle), but they\nmay not hold true in future operations.\nAn evaluation of docking closure rate was conducted using\n0.5 ft/sec closure starting at 50 ft from the docking port with\nan initial 2.5 ft offset from the approach corridor [17]. The\nhandling qualities effects are illustrated in Figure 3, using a\n\xe2\x80\x9cbubble\xe2\x80\x9d chart where each HQR is shown and the size of the\nHQR bubble is proportional to the number of ratings at that\nlevel.\n\nDisplay / Aiding Information\nVarious display information methods have been attempted\nto compensate for rotational-translational coupling effects\n[20, 21]. Each have varying degrees of success, none major\nand few with consensus of opinion. The most successful of\nthese are the deadband indicators \xe2\x80\x93 explicitly showing the\ncrew the attitude (and rate) at which a deadband in the\nRCAH controller will fire. Translational rate and\npositioning information with respect to the docking Local\nVertical Local Horizontal (LVLH) axis was also put to\nexcellent use.\n\nWith a RCAH holding the docking attitude, the higher\nclosure rate task produced generally worse HQRs, but not\ndramatically so. Adequate, if not desired docking\nperformance was the norm. However, with 6 DOF control\nand rotational due to translational coupling, ratings of 10\nwere generally given. At these higher closure rates, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t have enough time to be messing around with all these\n5\n\nkind of control inputs that you have to do.\xe2\x80\x9d Potentially\ncatastrophic consequences could result.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nRotating Targets\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nCurrent low earth operations to the ISS provide stationary or\nquasi-stationary docking targets. Future docking\nrequirements may involve rotating targets, especially in case\nof attitude control failures resulting in an uncooperative\ntarget vehicle.\n\nThese mission objectives created several design constraints\nrelevant to the handling qualities, and ultimately, the\nvehicle\xe2\x80\x99s design:\n\nEvaluations of docking attempts with rotating targets\nshowed this was possible, but the pilot workload was not\ntolerable [21].\n\n1)\n\nThe pilots demonstrated amazing adaptability to the various\nconfiguration effects and targets but an overwhelming need\nfor reconfigurable digital autopilot control (DAP) was\nvoiced. The ability to tailor the DAP gains and modes, in\nterms of pulse size, direct vs. pulse, and segregated,\nselectable modes per axis (rotational and translational), were\ncritical to success.\n\n2)\n\n3)\n\nIn the polar region, the very low sun angles create\nvisually powerful shadow effects that cause the loss of\nnatural vision depth cues and impair translational\nvelocity and landing zone awareness.\nOperations would be independent of the landing zone\nlighting conditions (unlike Apollo, where \xe2\x80\x9coptimal\xe2\x80\x9d\nlighting was designed by the timing of the launch).\nHabitat build-up constrains the landing approach\nprocedures and dictates much higher landing accuracy\nthan Apollo.\n\nThese design constraints further define the operational task\nor mission task elements which the vehicle\xe2\x80\x99s handling\nqualities and consequently, the spacecraft design:\n\n10\n\nLevel 3\n\n9\n8\n\na)\n\n7\n6\n\nc)\n\n4\n3\n\n1 Rating\n2 Ratings\n3 Ratings\n4 Ratings\n\n2\n\n10 ft IC\n\n20 ft IC\nPulse\n\nRCAH\n\nNatural vision may or may not be useful to the\npilot/crew.\n\nd) Approaches to the landing site will need an out-ofplane maneuver (such as a \xe2\x80\x9cdogleg\xe2\x80\x9d approach) to\nminimize collateral damage to the habitat from the\ndescent module in the event of a landing abort\n(with subsequent staging of any descent hardware).\n\n1\nPulse RCAH\n\nLanding precision is dictated by the proximity to a\nhabitat build-up; no \xe2\x80\x9coverflight\xe2\x80\x9d is permitted.\n\nb) Minimum fuel consumption is preeminent.\n\nLevel 2\n\n5\n\nLevel 1\n\nCooper-Harper Pilot Rating\n\nMissions were slated toward the scientifically\ninteresting lunar polar regions, unlike the equatorial\nlanding sites of Apollo.\nMissions were to be flown \xe2\x80\x9cany time.\xe2\x80\x9d\nA lunar habitat and a sustainable infrastructure would\nbe developed for an enduring scientific presence.\n\n50 ft IC\nPulse RCAH\n\nInitial Condition and Control Mode\n\nThe lack of natural vision references for the pilot/crew is\nboth a blessing and a curse. During Apollo, the constraints\nplaced by the design of the Lunar Module (LM) window for\ncrew visibility and landing trajectory were \xe2\x80\x9ca major\nproblem\xe2\x80\x9d [22]. Apollo used a \xe2\x80\x9cpitch-up\xe2\x80\x9d maneuver in the\nfinal approach descent and landing phase and a judiciously\ndesigned window configuration to enable the flight crew to\nhave approximately two minutes of viewing of the planned\nlanding site. The pitch-up sacrificed fuel usage by rotating\nthe vehicle to a near vertical orientation, so the crew could\nsee and verify the integrity of the landing site (e.g., free of\nrocks and debris, terrain slope within design allowances)\nthrough a window that provided almost 70 deg nose-low\nvisibility. Optimal visibility conditions were provided by\noperational procedures and constraints, including launch\ntimes, dates, and landing locations.\n\nFigure 3: Effect of Tasking Differences on HQRs\n\n4. LUNAR LANDING HQ IMPLICATIONS\nThe holistic design (and impact) of handling qualities on a\nspacecraft design is illustrated in the following, using the\ndesign and results of a piloted simulation of a lunar landing\nvehicle.\nLunar Lander Handling Qualities Design Implications\nAs NASA looked to return to the lunar surface, the design\nissues and lessons-learned of Apollo were closely studied as\nthey are still relevant today for practical planetary and lunar\nlander vehicle designs and missions [22-27]. From this\nbaseline, additional challenges for the vehicle design were\nlevied to improve the scientific return for manned lunar\nmissions.\n\nAutomated landing of Apollo was possible, but all landings\nwere manually flown with the crew taking over control\nbetween 550 and 240 ft above the touchdown zone elevation\n[26]. After Apollo 11, each crew performed at least 1, and\n6\n\nmethod requires very large attitudes for rate or\nposition hold functions. Elaborate display and alerting\nfunctions would be needed for the crew to\nappropriately monitor normal operations and provide\ntimely intervention and recovery in event of failures.\n\nas many as 18, landing zone re-designations during the\npitch-up phase [27].\nTechnologies developed since Apollo offer potential ways\nto break some of the aforementioned Apollo operational and\ndesign constraints as well as meeting the new Exploration\nchallenges. For instance, Synthetic and Enhanced Vision\n(SV/EV) technologies, conceived and developed in the\naviation domain, may eliminate the challenges imposed by a\nnatural vision constraint and thus, enable additional benefits\nfor safer, more efficient operations [28]. These technologies\nare being used, in whole or in part, under the Autonomous\nLanding and Hazard Avoidance Technology (ALHAT) [29].\n\nControl Power\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cSatisfactory\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cAcceptable for\nEmergency Operations Only\xe2\x80\x9d handling characteristics\nguidelines for rotational control effectiveness, using the\nCooper rating scale [35] emerged from the Apollo data [36].\nThe criterion, for a RCAH control law, boils down to: 1) the\nmaximum rotational acceleration authority; and, 2) the\nchosen maximum rate command provided to the pilot.\nThe maximum rotational acceleration authority is\napproximately the RCS jet size, multiplied by the number of\nRCS jets and their moment arm and divided by the\nrotational inertia. Part of the HQ design trade-space can be\nillustrated using the Apollo LM experience. For Apollo, the\ncriteria were met when four RCS jets were used. Nominally,\nhowever, only two jets were fired to conserve RCS\npropellant but for circumstances that dictate higher\nrotational control (e.g., excessive rate error in the RCAH\ncontrol law), four jets were available [13]. Apollo also\nplaced the RCS jets on the ascent module. This placement\nincreased the moment arm (increased rotational\neffectiveness). It also increased the LM ascent mass. The\nRCS jets were also used for on-orbit attitude control. This\nobviated the need to have two sets of RCS jets (one for\ndescent; one for ascent and on-orbit) but the LM RCS jets,\nsized for the landing mission, were found to be too large for\non-orbit operations, causing proximity and operations HQ\nissues [37].\n\nSV/EV technologies offer the possibility that fuel-expensive\nApollo-like pitch-up maneuvers would be unnecessary using\n\xe2\x80\x9cequivalent vision\xe2\x80\x9d instead [30]. SV/EV technologies can\nprovide equivalent visual information sufficient for the crew\nto obviate the impact of landing zone obscurants and be\nindependent of window sizes and placements, visual\nillusions, or lighting/depth perception conditions.\nThese challenges exist within the broader context of manual\ncontrol, handling qualities, and the engineering design tradespace for a Lunar Landing vehicle.\nLunar Lander Handling Qualities Design\nA piloted simulation study investigated the handling\nqualities of a lunar landing vehicle and the influence of\ncritical design issues with operational employment\nconsequences. The focus was on visual cueing and control\neffector sizing during manual control of the approach and\nlanding of a lunar landing vehicle, enabling a quantification\nof the trade-space for the vehicle design and operational\ndeployment. Automatic control modes of the vehicle were a\nrecognized design feature of future lunar lander vehicles;\nthe implications of which are discussed in Section 5.\n\nThe present-day concern is that the rotational control\neffectiveness required to meet the Apollo guidelines are\nsignificantly larger than what current designs may\npractically provide. Validation of the guidelines is needed\nand possible alternative methods to satisfy handling\nqualities should be explored.\n\nControl Laws\xe2\x80\x94RCAH control laws with a phase-plane\ncontroller were evaluated. Other control law methods were\nrejected for evaluation:\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\n\xef\x82\xb7\n\nNASA Ames has recently conducted two Vertical Motion\nSimulator tests evaluating the validity of these rotational\ncontrol effectiveness criteria from Apollo [31,38].\nEvaluations were conducted using a 15 degree (deg)\nglideslope trajectory to a pitch-up for vertical landing,\nmirroring the initial Apollo lunar landings. The term\n\xe2\x80\x9cglideslope\xe2\x80\x9d is used throughout as an analogy to the\naeronautics domain, where a constant approach angle to\nlanding is flown. In this application, a constant angle\napproach is only approximate; the trajectory curves from the\ninitial approach angle to smoothly transition to a hover point\nabove the landing zone, transitioning to a vertical descent to\nlanding.\n\nTranslational control using the RCS, while precision\ncontrol is offered, will typically be underpowered and\nthus, not conducive to minimum fuel/minimum fuel\nobjectives [31].\nThrust vectoring control (TVC) of the descent engine\n[32] offers excellent control power, but is critically\nflawed due to potential failure modes. Apollo\nevaluated this concept but rejected it, limiting TVC\nrates to provide trim control to avoid catastrophic TVC\nactuator failure consequences [33].\nMore sophisticated control methods such as\ntranslational rate command-position hold functions\nwere dismissed because, while excellent performance\nhas been demonstrated in rotorcraft applications and\nelsewhere [34], they lack in simplicity of design. They\nalso can suffer from the human-centered design\nprinciples since, with only one-sixth gravity, this\n\nTesting was conducted with and without explicit pitch, roll,\nand rate-of-descent guidance commands shown on headdown displays. Testing was planned to vary the evaluation\ntask, flying with and without a 250 ft lateral offset/dog-leg\napproach from the initial trajectory to the vertical landing.\n7\n\nangle was flown for the initial Apollo LM missions, but the\nlater so-called \xe2\x80\x9cJ\xe2\x80\x9d missions used trajectories approaching 25\ndeg glideslope. Future vehicles may find it advantageous to\nuse higher glideslope angles to landing [39]. Trajectory\ndesign is part of the trade-off in fuel consumption and\nnatural vision viewing of the landing site.\n\nHowever, pre-test work showed that, without explicit\nguidance, the evaluation pilots could not reliably complete\nthe task with a lateral offset. For the no-guidance test cases,\nonly a straight-in task was flown.\nFor the lateral offset task with guidance, the Apollo design\nguidelines were roughly supported. But for a straight-in\ntask, without an offset, the degradation of handling qualities\nwith decreasing control authority was not strongly\nsupported.\n\nSecond, the previous work provided for and allowed the use\nof direct translation control by the pilot using a translational\nhand controller. Although the control authority was\nminimal, it was permitted and introduced a degree-offreedom which differed from Apollo. In Apollo, only\nrotational attitude control to effect translational positioning\nwas used because of the significant amount of rotational\ncoupling introduced by translational control inputs. The\nRCS jets were located on the Ascent Module for maximum\nrotational control authority. Evaluations were conducted\nwithout allowing direct translational control for comparison.\n\nIn the second test, the characteristics of the Lander Vehicle\nwere changed, but the major elements of the test were\nreplicated.\nA summary plot of the data against the guidelines is shown\nin Figure 4. The plot uses median HQRs for the twelve\nevaluation pilots. The trends generally follow the first\nsimulation test results. At the highest levels of control\npower tested, median Level 1 pilot ratings were generally\ngiven. The individual rating data, however, exhibits\nsubstantial scatter. Some Level 3 or nearly Level 3 ratings\nwere given for those configurations with median Level 1\nratings. The rating scatter warrants concerns since this\nsuggests the possibility of lurking cliff-like HQ\ncharacteristics where Level 1 handling characteristics can\nquickly degrade due to the presence of system\nnonlinearities, latency, or handling characteristics\ninappropriately sensitive to pilot techniques [38].\n\nFinally, the critical influence of visual cues was considered.\nAs the trajectory approach angle is changed, the pitch\nattitude will vary; thus, affecting the amount of time that the\ncrew can use for natural vision viewing of the landing site.\nThe previous work showed that manual flight to an offset\nlanding zone was not possible. One might consider that this\nresult was because the out-the-window simulated visual\ncues were insufficient to support the task (as discussed\nlater). On the other hand, the visual cues might have been\nsufficient but the control characteristics were deficient. In\nany event, the influence of natural vision and the potential\nof \xe2\x80\x9cequivalent vision\xe2\x80\x9d technologies warranted exploration.\nEquivalent vision may represent a new tool in the manned\nplanetary exploration designers\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9ctool-bag.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nCheatham and Hacker Lunar Lander Handling Qualities\n100\n90\n\nLevel 1 - Median\nLevel 2 - Median\nLevel 3 - Median\n\nMax.

A generic-spacecraft simulation within this\nframework served as a test bed for modeling spacecraft\ndynamics, propulsion, control systems, guidance, and\ndisplays.\n\n20\n\nFigure 4: HQR Level Data [38] vs. Guidelines [13]\nTest Description\nA pilot-in-the-loop simulation was conducted to explore the\ncontrol and display interactions on the handling qualities of\na lunar lander vehicle.\n\nThe vehicle model was composed of interconnected stages,\nsimulated using a parent/child relationship. The ascent stage\nwas modeled as the parent with the descent stage as a child.\nThe descent stage contained separate mass models for the\nmain engine fuel, RCS fuel, and the airlock. Force models\nwere provided for the main engine, each of the sixteen RCS\nengines, and the four landing gear models. For simplicity,\nthe throttle-able, thrust output of the main engine force\n\nThis work built upon the previous work [31,38] but\nexplored the control and display interactions in a lunar\nlander design.\nFirst, the previous work evaluated only shallow 15 deg\nglideslope trajectories to the landing zone. This trajectory\n8\n\nmodel was placed close to the lateral and horizontal axes of\nthe stacked center-of-mass. Active gimbaling of the main\nengine was provided to trim the thrust vector through the\nCM. All forces and moments were applied to the stacked\nvehicle\xe2\x80\x99s center of mass. Fuel slosh was not modeled.\nThe pilot, as defined by the design eye point reference\n(DERP), was located 28.1 ft above the extended landing\ngear position. The center of mass at the initial starting\ncondition was 6.6 ft below the DERP. The four RCS jets\nwere placed in a ring around the descent stage using an\northogonal quadrant of four individual thrusters for attitude\ncontrol. The RCS thruster size was experimentally varied.\nThe RCS jets were located at a 14.8 ft radial from the\ncenterline of the vehicle (i.e., the moment arm),\napproximately 7.7 ft below the DERP.\nFigure 6: Descent Module (top view) RCS Locations \xe2\x80\x93\nQuads 1-4 and Jets 1-4 on each Quad\nThe RCS jet size was experimentally varied to create\nvarious angular acceleration control authorities.\nAn autothrottle was mechanized to hold a pilot-commanded\nvertical descent rate. Translational Hand Controller (THC)\npilot inputs commanded discrete one ft/s increments to the\ncommanded vertical descent rate. Proportional and integral\ncontrol modulated the descent engine thrust. The engine\nthrottle response rate was not limited.\nSimulator\nThe experiment was conducted in the fixed-base Lunar\nFlight Deck simulation facility at NASA Langley Research\nCenter (LaRC). The Lunar Flight Deck used multiple\nprojectors and a dome screen to provide a 135o horizontal\n(H) x 67.5o vertical (V) field-of-view. The screen was\nlocated 10.6 ft from the DERP. The dome and projection\nsystem were biased to provide 22.5o up and 45.0o down\nviewing angle from the DERP. The multiple image\ngenerators and projectors are warped and blended to provide\nuniform and seamless ~30 pixels per deg resolution across\nthe field-of-view, referenced to the DERP.\n\nFigure 5: Simulated Lunar Landing Vehicle\nControl Laws\nThe guidance and control laws were implemented in\nSimulink/Stateflow and autocoded for use in the real-time\nsimulation shell (LaSRS++).\nRCAH control laws (in body-axis pitch, roll and yaw axes)\nincluded an RCS mixer which determined the jets to fire to\nprovide the commanded accelerations. The rate deadband\nfor the phase plane controller was 2.0 deg/sec and the\nattitude deadband was 0.5 deg.\n\nA lunar polar landing site was preferred for the evaluations\nbut terrain data of reasonable resolution was not available.\nInstead, the Apollo 15 landing site was utilized because of\nthe availability of higher resolution data and the interesting\nterrain features it provided. The out-the-window (OTW)\nlunar database was created using lunar topology and\nimagery data collected by the Clementine project [41].\nMedium resolution data was used in the general area of the\nApollo 15 landing site, approximately 500 meters per\nelevation post, draped with 125 meter per pixel imagery.\nHigher resolution data was inset in the immediate vicinity of\nthe Apollo 15 landing site (15 meters per elevation postspacing, draped with 4 meter per pixel imagery).\n\nSixteen RCS jets were arranged in four quads, with four\northogonal jets in each quad (Figure 6). A simplified\nthruster mapping dedicated RCS thruster firings to each\nmoment command. Because of the simplified logic, when\nsimultaneous pitch and roll inputs are commanded, the\ncontrol authorities are effectively halved in each axis.\nVarious jet combination mappings were considered but\nrejected for simplicity of design.\n\nIn the landing area, the resolution of the OTW database was\ngood, but not to levels approaching the real-world. The\n9\n\nThe resulting parabolic shaping mimics that used in Apollo.\nThe shaped roll and pitch inputs were multiplied by 12\ndeg/sec to create the pilot commanded roll and pitch RCAH\ncontrol law inputs.\n\nOTW presentation was augmented with boulder and habitat\nmodels to increase the visual density.\nThe evaluation pilot (EP) conducted the task in a standing\nposition, analogous to the Apollo Lunar Module design. The\ncrew station is shown in Figure 7. A window (20 inch H x\n14 inch V) approximated the field-of-view anticipated for a\nLunar Lander vehicle. Two head-down (13.25 inch H x 10.5\ninch V) displays, using 1280 x 1024 pixel resolution,\nprovided primary flight, navigation, and systems awareness\nfor the EP.\n\nThe left-hand THC was provisioned for 3-axis translational\ncontrol commands but only up/down vertical commands\nwere active. Up/down pilot inputs of the THC were\nconverted into vertical descent rate command increments.\nEach discrete THC input would increment the value of the\ncommanded descent rate by one ft/sec.\nAural call-outs of the altitude above the terrain (extended\ngear height) were provided during the landing phase in 10 ft\nincrements starting at 150 ft and continuing until\ntouchdown.\nHead-Down Displays\nThe two-color head-down displays showed four primary\ndisplay formats: a) Attitude Direction Indicator (ADI); b)\nNavigation Display (ND); c) Vertical Situation Display\n(VSD); and Auxiliary Display.\nThe ADI (Fig. 8) served as the primary flight display. The\nADI showed lunar attitude reference using a roll/pitch/yaw\n\xe2\x80\x9ceight-ball.\xe2\x80\x9d The ADI included digital readouts of ground\nspeed (in knots), altitude (in ft, height above the landing\nzone), radar altitude (in ft, height terrain below extended\ngear position), and vertical descent rate (in ft/sec). On the\nvertical descent rate display, a magenta circle indicated the\nguidance-commanded descent rate. Yellow pitch, roll, and\nyaw \xe2\x80\x9cflight director\xe2\x80\x9d needles were also displayed depending\nupon the experimental condition. The needles provided \xe2\x80\x9cflyto\xe2\x80\x9d pitch, roll, and yaw attitude guidance to fly the\ntrajectories to landing. Additional, less-critical status mode\ninformation was shown in periphery.\n\nFigure 7: Lunar Landing Flight Deck\nControl Inceptors\nThe EPs used an Apollo-vintage Rotational Hand Controller\n(RHC) and Translational Hand Controller (THC). The\ncontrollers were mechanical and their characteristics fixed.\nThe right-hand RHC provided 3-axis rotational control\ncommands, using a base pivot for roll, palm-pivot for pitch,\nand twist-pivot for yaw. The mechanical characteristics of\nthe RHC provided +/- 27.5 deg total deflection in roll using\na maximum force of 3.5 lb applied at the roll pivot point\n(five inches above the roll rotation point, approximately\nmid-grip). There was approximately 0.5 lb of hysteresis\nwith 1.0 lb of break-out force.\nThe mechanical characteristics of the RHC provided +/-15.0\ndeg total deflection in pitch with maximum force of 3.5 lb\napplied at the pitch pivot point (~2.625 inches above the\nrotation point, near top of grip). There was approximately\n0.75 lb of hysteresis with 0.25 lb of break-out force.\nA deadband function using 15% of the full-throw\ndeflections was applied to the pitch and roll signal and\nscaled to create a +/-1.0 command signal. The scaled roll\nand pitch inputs (\xef\x81\xa4) were parabolically shaped to create the\npitch rate and roll rate commands (qs and ps, respectively)\nusing the equation , \xc2\xa0\n1\n\xc2\xa0\n| | where the term\nwas equal to 0.90. The shaping\nfunction appropriately tailored the response sensitivity for\nthe sidestick controller.\n\nFigure 8: ADI\nThe ND provided a top-down, \xe2\x80\x9cGod\xe2\x80\x99s eye\xe2\x80\x9d view of ownship\nposition and the planned landing zone (Fig. 9). The ND was\n10\n\nalways drawn with ownship in the center, heading up, and\nthe range scale automatically adjusted to keep the landing\nzone on the display. Synthetic imagery was used in the\nbackground. The ND transitioned from a flight-mode to a\nhover mode once the ground speed was less than 38 knots.\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nIn the flight-mode, the landing zone was depicted by a\nmagenta-colored hexagon symbol.\nIn hover mode, the landing zone was depicted by two\noctagons. The octagons were sized to accurately\nrepresent the size of the desired and adequate landing\nperformance standards. In addition, digital display of\nthe body-axis forward and side velocities were\npresented with a graphical representation of this same\ninformation, indicated by a white line and cross symbol\nemanating from the ownship position.\nIn the hover mode, a hover cue symbol was also\ndisplayed, depending upon the experimental condition.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nguidance provided corrections to pitch angle, roll angle\nand thrust level of the vehicle to correct for any\ndeviations from the desired trajectory.\nThe guidance mode switched to a hover phase at a\nfixed-time prior to the end of the straight-line approach\nphase trajectory. In this phase, pitch angle, roll angle\nand thrust level commands would bring the vehicle to a\nhover over the landing target at ~100 ft height.\nThe final descent phase was initiated once the pitch,\nroll, velocity and horizontal position of the vehicle was\nwithin parameters over the designated landing area.\n\nHover Cue Guidance\nAn alternative form of flight guidance was mechanized for\nexperimental variation as a possibly simpler means of\nenabling lunar landings and tailored toward manual control\nconsiderations. In this case, the guidance was in the form of\na hover cue. The hover cue is part of an integrated\nsymbology set, including the ownship position symbol,\nvelocity vector, and conformal landing zone designator.\nThe hover cue was mechanized as a \xe2\x80\x9cfly-to\xe2\x80\x9d symbology\nelement where the positioning and dynamics of the cue\nprovided manual control guidance for the pilot to smoothly\napproach a desired landing position and achieve zero\nhorizontal velocity (i.e., a hover condition). The pilot\xe2\x80\x99s task\nis to use the pitch and roll inceptor to place the hover cue\nand hold its position over the desired landing site (i.e., \xe2\x80\x9cput\nthe ball in the octagon\xe2\x80\x9d).\nThe hover cue closely follows from rotorcraft work [42]\nwith adaptation for a non-atmospheric flying vehicle as\ndescribed in the following. The cue is, in essence, a flight\ndirector. The motivation for this \xe2\x80\x9cguidance\xe2\x80\x9d element is that,\nif successful, a hover cue would be ideally suited for a\nmanually-controlled re-designated landing task, especially\nwhen coupled with a head-up display or head-worn display\nprojecting this cue against conformal imagery or the actual\nlunar terrain. In these cases, the hover cue would be\ncontrolled by the pilot, superimposed on a pilot-selected\nlanding site; the hover cue \xe2\x80\x9cguidance\xe2\x80\x9d provides a simple\nmeans of achieving a hover over a pilot-designated point.\n\nFigure 9: ND \xe2\x80\x93 Hover Mode\nThe VSD provided a profile/side view of ownship position\nand the landing zone. The auxiliary display provided a\nsimulated forward looking infrared (FLIR) image of the\noutside world from 45o to 75o nose-low from the DERP.\nThis camera view supplemented the EP\xe2\x80\x99s visibility below\nthe 45o cut-off of the simulated window.\n\nFor this work, the conformal landing zone designator was\nthe desired touchdown/landing position. The velocity vector\nprovided a graphical depiction of the horizontal velocity\n(digital readouts of forward and side velocity were also\nprovided). The hover cue was shown on either the ND or on\na Head-Worn Display (HWD) [41].\n\nCommand Guidance\nThe ADI flight director bars were driven to provide explicit\npitch, roll, and yaw command guidance to fly an approach\npath, transition to a vertical descent, and conduct a vertical\nlanding. The guidance was defined in a series of phases,\ndepending on distance from the landing site.\n\nOwnship position was fixed in the center of the display and\nautomatic range settings were applied to keep the landing\nzone at a reasonable range scale on the displays.\nEarth-bound vehicle applications of the hover cue guidance\nhave been implemented, but to the authors\xe2\x80\x99 knowledge, this\nwas the first lunar lander application.\n\nThe command guidance used three phases:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThe approach phase used a constant deceleration profile\nwhich allowed for a near-constant pitch (deck) angle,\nflight path angle and thrust-to-weight ratio. The\n11\n\nIn the design of the hover cue dynamics, it has been\nassumed that three coincident real-axis roots between\naircraft velocity and stick position produced desirable\ndynamics [42]. The positioning of the hover cue followed\nthis assumption where the pilot applies compensation to\ncontrol the hover cue in a position (x) closure task (Figure\n10).\n\nTable 2\nValues for RCAH Time Constant / Hover Cue\nRCS Jet Size\n\n\xef\x81\xb4\xef\x80\xa0\n\nControl Power\n1.1 deg/sec\n\n2\n\n100 lbf\n\n1.6 deg/sec\n\n2\n\n180 lbf\n\n2.9 deg/sec2\n\n2.75 sec\n\n270 lbf\n\n4.3 deg/sec2\n\n1.75 sec\n\n540 lbf\n\n2\n\n68 lbf\n\nWith this assumption, the longitudinal position of the hover\ncue, Ax is derived.

The selections and\nrationale were as follows:\n\nterm was approximated by\n\n.\n1\nBy this assumption, the hover cue effectively uses a\nwashed-out RHC input (\xef\x81\xa4) where the time constant, \xef\x81\xb4, is\ndependent upon the responsiveness of the pitch rate\ncontroller. The time constant (\xef\x81\xb4) was selected to\napproximate the pitch rate response of the phase-plane\ncontrollers and the gain, KRCAH was equal to the maximum,\nfull stick deflection rate command (12 deg/sec). Since the\nangular acceleration was experimentally varied, the selected\nvalues for \xef\x81\xb4 (shown in Table 2) were varied accordingly.\nThese \xef\x81\xb4 values were defined by the approximate time to\nreach 63% of the spacecraft\xe2\x80\x99s rate response for a full-stick\ninput command.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n12\n\nThe ND range was automatically adjusted to keep the\nlanding zone conformally on the screen. The visual\nangle subtended by the ND was approximately 20 deg.\nTherefore, the display unit scaling, Kx, was equal to 20\ndeg/NDrange, where NDrange was the automatically set\nrange scale in ft. The minimum navigation scale range\n(NDrange) was 200 ft.\nPre-test experimentation indicated that a bandwidth\nselection (\xef\x81\xb70) of 0.5 rad/sec was a reasonable selection\nconsidering the piloting demands for this task and the\nvehicle dynamics being considered as \xe2\x80\x9crepresentative\xe2\x80\x9d\nfor a lunar landing mission.\nAs detailed in [42], the relationship between the\nvelocity scaling and the display scaling (in addition of\nthe bandwidth parameter) effectively specify the speed\n\ndisconnect alert was triggered. Concurrently, the landing\nzone was automatically re-designated left or right by 250 ft\nfrom its original position. The EP was then tasked to fly and\nland on this re-designated landing zone using either the\nhover cue (hereafter referred to as the \xe2\x80\x9caided\xe2\x80\x9d condition) or\nexplicit pitch/roll guidance (hereafter referred to as the\n\xe2\x80\x9cguided\xe2\x80\x9d condition).\n\nof the position loop closure response. For the selected\nbandwidth, root locus calculations for the assumed loop\nclosure task dictated that a well-damped loop gain,\nshould be 0.065 (which provided a damping\nratio of 0.85). The velocity display scaling\n\nfalls out.\n\nSmoothing was applied to the input signals to temper\n(somewhat) the jerkiness of the symbol movement due to\nthe discrete nature of the RCS firings. First-order, low-pass\nfilters were applied to the attitudes, and attitude rates with\ntime constants of 0.2 sec and 0.1 sec, respectively. Firstorder, low-pass filters were also applied to the RHC inputs\nto eliminate high-frequency noise in the signal, using a time\nconstant of 0.2 sec.\n\nThe 250 ft offset landing zone mimicked the scenario where\na re-designated landing zone had been executed and the\npilot must now fly to the new landing area. The scenario\nwas also analogous to the offset landing task from the\naeronautics domain. The 250 ft offset was chosen to match\npreviously conducted work [31,38].\nThe pilot\xe2\x80\x99s task was to control the vehicle\xe2\x80\x99s trajectory, fly to\na hover transition, and execute a vertical descent to land to\nachieve prescribed landing performance standards using\neither explicit guidance or a hover cue in addition to\navailable out-the-window visual cues.\n\nExperiment\nThe primary experimental goal was to evaluate the\ninteraction of controls and displays on the handling qualities\nof a lunar landing vehicle. Variations in approach trajectory\nwere experimentally tested because they interact with fuel\nand natural vision viewability of the landing zone.\n\nIn both conditions, the desired descent rate to fly to the\nhover transition point, developed from the guidance concept\ndescribed above, was provided. Vertical descent rate was\ncontrolled by discrete THC inputs.\n\nA full-factorial matrix was developed, consisting of 3\napproach trajectories (15, 30, and 45 deg), five control\npowers (Table 2), and 2 guidance conditions (head-down\nguidance on ADI and hover cue flight director). The hover\ncue was also evaluated as part of a \xe2\x80\x9cvirtual HUD\xe2\x80\x9d concept\nusing a HWD [41]. Due to time limitations, a subset of this\nmatrix was identified as the primary matrix which the\nmajority of EPs were to evaluate; the remainder of the\nmatrix was tested as time permitted.\n\nThe desired and adequate performance standards are shown\nin Table 3. These parameters only applied to the landing. At\nthe end of each run, a \xe2\x80\x9cscorecard\xe2\x80\x9d was shown on their headdown display given them their performance against each of\nthese standards.\nTable 3\nTask Performance Standards\n\nEach run of the experiment began 1000 ft above the landing\ntarget. Three different approach angles were experimentally\nvaried: 15 deg; 30 deg; and 45 deg. The initial distance uprange from the landing site was varied accordingly. The\ninitial velocity varied as well to provide approximately the\nsame duration of the approach from start to finish.\n\nParameter\n\nAdequate\nPerformance\n\nRange At\nTouchdown\n\n< 15 ft\n\n< 25 ft\n\nSink Rate\n\n< 5 ft/sec\n\n< 7 ft/sec\n\nForward/Side\nVelocity\n\n< 2 ft/sec\n\n< 4 ft/sec\n\nPitch/Roll Angle\n\n< \xc2\xb1 3 deg\n\n< \xc2\xb1 6 deg\n\nPitch/Roll Rate\n\n< \xc2\xb1 3 deg/sec\n\n< \xc2\xb1 6 deg/sec\n\nYaw Rate\n\nEvaluation Tasks\xe2\x80\x94Each run started at approximately 1000\nft above the landing zone elevation flying on auto-pilot\nfollowing the constant deceleration trajectory profile, to a\ndesignated landing zone directly forward of the vehicle\xe2\x80\x99s\ntrack. This period of auto-flight provided two benefits: 1) it\nallowed the pilots to prepare for the next phase (manual\nflight); and, 2) it was representative of an operational\nprofile, where the auto-flight system will fly to a certain\naltitude, but the crew will take-over manually for the final\nlanding. This procedure was done for all Apollo flights [27]\nand will likely occur for other crewed missions. An\nadditional motivation is that this auto-flight period might be\nrepresentative of a re-designation period where the crew\nmight be evaluating real-time sensor data and navigation\nsystems data to decide if the planned landing zone is safe\nand appropriate or if a landing zone re-designation is\nnecessary [29].\n\nDesired\nPerformance\n\n< \xc2\xb1 1.0 deg/sec\n\n< \xc2\xb1 1.5 ft/sec\n\nNo performance standards were enforced during the\napproach phase with the exception of a vertical descent rate\nperformance standard. The pilots were instructed to follow\nthe vertical descent rate guidance, but the pilots were told\nthat if they stopped their descent, their task performance\ncould be no better than \xe2\x80\x9cadequate\xe2\x80\x9d. If they climbed, their\ntask performance was considered \xe2\x80\x9cnot adequate.\xe2\x80\x9d Fuel\nusage (propellant consumption) was not a parameter in the\ntask performance standards, because this test was designed\nas an evaluation of handling qualities. Fuel consumption, of\ncourse, is critical for a spacecraft design and it is analyzed\n\nAt 500 ft above the touchdown zone, the auto-flight system\nwas disconnected automatically. An aural auto-flight\n13\n\nreasonable piloting task. The flight crew had sufficient time\nto effect a landing.\n\npost-test because of its criticality. To use it as a CooperHarper task performance standard would skew the piloting\ntechnique to minimize propellant usage. The vertical\ndescent rate requirement was the one concession to\ncriticality of fuel. The descent rate criteria essentially\nrequired that the vehicle was continually descending toward\nthe landing zone. If a hover condition, or worse yet, a climb\nis performed, fuel consumption will be unreasonable given\nthat this type of vehicle will undoubtedly be \xe2\x80\x9cfuel-critical.\xe2\x80\x9d\nWhile a hover or climb may be technically feasible, it would\nhave to be a last-ditch maneuver. A hover or climb\nessentially buys the crew more time to control the vehicle.\nThis is a sign of poor handling qualities since the landing\nsite is assumed to be clear of obstructions. Therefore, task\nperformance penalties were enforced.\n\nAt the hover transition point, the constant deceleration\nprofile could create a significant pitch task. This task was\nmost demanding for the lower glideslope angles. For\ninstance, the 15 deg glideslope approach used a fairly large\npitch attitude (~20o pitch attitude) that had to be removed\nvery quickly and precisely as the hover transition point was\nreached. If not, the vehicle would undershoot or overshoot\nthe landing zone and then, low altitude re-corrections were\nnecessary. In contrast, the 45 deg glideslope approach\ninvolved very little pitch attitude change. The ground speed\napproaching the landing zone was considerably less. As\nsuch, the hover transition was neither as large nor did it\nrequire as high a degree of precision. The 45 deg approach\ntask was more of a lateral tracking task, whose duration\nconsists of the entire approach. The 15 deg approach task\nwas much more demanding, involving both the lateral offset\nand the abrupt pitch-over near the hover transition point.\n\nOther Elements\nExperiment Protocol\xe2\x80\x94Prior to the start of data collection,\nthe EPs were briefed on the purpose of the experiment and\nflew numerous practice trials following the experiment\nprotocol with a variety of experimental configurations until\nthey reached an acceptable, consistent level of proficiency\nin the task. Upon the start of formal data collection, for each\nconfiguration, the EPs first flew one approach and landing\nfor practice/familiarity, followed by a minimum of two runs\nfor \xe2\x80\x9cdata.\xe2\x80\x9d The EP had the option for a third run if they felt\nthat the two runs exhibited very different characteristics that\npotentially hampered their handling qualities assessment.\n\nThese observations were quantified by the HQRs as shown\nin Figure 11. The pilot rating data is plotted for the highest\ncontrol power condition (8.6 deg/s2) as the task and\nguidance method was varied. For the shallow 15 deg\nglideslope, some Level 1 and some Level 3 ratings were\ngiven. These significant rating discrepancies reflect subtle\ntiming and piloting differences in transitioning to the hover\nphase can create significant performance differences.\nConversely, predominately Level 1 ratings were given in the\n45 deg glideslope, reflecting an easier piloting.\n\nFollowing the tasks, the EPs assigned a HQR using the\nCooper-Harper rating scale. Pilot comments were then\ngiven, generally prompted via a comment card. Finally,\nNASA Task Load Index (TLX) workload ratings were\ngiven.\n\nApollo used more of a constant jerk profile (first derivative\nof acceleration) [43] with a tailored pitch-up prior to the\nhover transition. Apollo experience showed that a constant\ndeceleration profile was not preferred because of the abrupt\npitch change and the need for a natural vision viewing\nopportunity. These data show that a constant deceleration\nprofile is do-able, especially for higher glideslopes.\n\nEvaluation Pilots\xe2\x80\x94Eight EPs flew this experiment,\ncompleted in 2009. All subjects had graduated as pilots\nfrom the U.S. Air Force or Navy Test Pilot Schools and\nwere experienced in aircraft handling qualities evaluations.\nNeedless to say, none were experienced in lunar landings.\nSome had considerable experience in rotary wing vehicles.\nTwo of the EPs were current or former Astronauts.\n\nEffect of Glideslope Variations \xe2\x80\x93 Piloting Task Influence \xe2\x80\x94\nBy the nature of the constant deceleration approach profile,\nthe approach phase was essentially a pitch attitude\nmaintenance task. Very few pitch inputs were required to\nmaintain the approach path once manual control was\nrequired. So the initial task was primarily a roll task to start\ntracking toward the new landing zone. The pilot had from\nthe 500 ft altitude point to the hover transition to correct for\nthe lateral offset. For all glideslopes flown, the 250 ft offset\napproach (simulating a landing point redesignation) was a\n\n1 Rating\n2 Ratings\n3 Ratings\n4 Ratings\n\n8\n\nLevel 3\n\nThe influence \xe2\x80\x93 and interdependency \xe2\x80\x93 of manual control\nhandling qualities and the vehicle design considerations are\ndescribed using the handling qualities results.\n\n9\n\n7\n6\nLevel 2\n\nHolistic Impact of Design/HQs\n\n5\n4\n3\n\nLevel 1\n\nCooper-Harper Pilot Rating\n\n10\n\n2\n1\n\n15 deg\nGuide\n\nAided\n\n30 deg\nGuide\n\nAided\n\n45 deg\nGuide\n\nAided\n\nGlideslope\n\nFigure 11: HQRs of Glideslope and Guidance Variation\n(8.6 deg/s2 control power)\n14\n\nThe pilot rating and comment data also indicated areas\nwhere the hover cue needs to be improved as well. The\ndiscrete nature of the control law induced some substantial\n\xe2\x80\x9cjumpiness\xe2\x80\x9d in the position of the symbol. Throttle changes\ncaused by descent rate control inputs and RCS deadband\nfirings were most problematic. Pilots often learned to\n\xe2\x80\x9cfilter\xe2\x80\x9d this out, but they desired more predictable response\nbehavior. Also, pilots could get behind the hover cue and\nenter into overcontrol / pilot-induced oscillations for the low\ncontrol power configurations. Vehicle attitude still needed\nto be monitored and this information was not in immediate\nspatial proximity. Methods to ameliorate these\ncharacteristics were identified but not implemented at this\ntime. The aided condition was clearly preferred especially\nsince it broke the criticality of timing in successfully\ncompleting the task. The pilots were more directly in control\nof the hover transition task.\n\nGuidance Method\xe2\x80\x94Two concepts for guidance were tested,\nGuided (using ADI needles) vs. Aided (using a hover cue on\nthe navigation display).\nThe data generally showed that explicit attitude guidance\nwas good in that it provide simple and straight-forward\ncommand information to enable the transition from the\napproach to a hover over the landing area. The command\ninformation provided guidance as to when and what\nmagnitude of pitch and roll attitude changes were required\nto establish a hover over the landing zone. The display was\nunambiguous and clear and all critical flight information\n(attitude, guidance, speeds, and descent rate information)\nwas in close visual proximity. Especially for low control\npower configurations, vehicle attitude was critical \xe2\x80\x9clead\xe2\x80\x9d\ninformation required to keep the vehicle under control and\nto anticipate the size and timing of control inputs to get into\nthe hover position.\n\nHead-Down vs. Head-Up Information\xe2\x80\x94The various\ntrajectories, in addition to piloting task differences,\nmodulated the amount of time that the EPs could use the\nOTW visual cues for the task.\n\nUnfortunately, the pitch attitude change, especially for the\n15 deg approaches near the hover transition point, required\nclose attention by the EP. It also required precision on the\npart of the EP to track the attitude to achieve desired\nperformance. If neither of these conditions were met, the\nvehicle could significantly overshoot or undershoot\ngenerating low altitude corrections and workload on the part\nof the pilot to use the guidance and the ND to re-correct to\nthe landing zone.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThis control behavior is most apparent in the HQR data for\nthe lowest control power test (1.1 deg/s2) as shown in Figure\n12. Clear Level 3 handling qualities were indicated for 15\ndeg glideslope landing tasks using ADI guidance. As the\ntask got easier, the impact was not as severe (15 to 45 deg\nglideslope).\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n9\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nLevel 3\n\n8\n7\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nLevel 2\n\n6\n5\n4\n3\n\n1 Rating\n2 Ratings\n3 Ratings\n4 Ratings\n\n2\n\nLevel 1\n\nCooper-Harper Pilot Rating\n\n10\n\n1\n\n15 deg\nGuide\n\nAided\n\n30 deg\nGuide\n\nAided\n\n45 deg\nGuide\n\nAided\n\nThe task was flown almost completely head-down. All\nthe information required to conduct the task was\navailable on the ADI and ND.\nHowever, almost all EPs noted the importance out-thewindow visual cues for verification and validation of\nthe head-down information. This was not part of the test\nbut it should be evaluated in the future. For this test, the\nnavigation solution was perfect (no errors) so the ND\npresentation was a completely faithful representation of\nthe outside landing zone.\nThe OTW visual cues were insufficient alone for the\nEPs, in general, to control the vehicle \xe2\x80\x93 at least to the\ndegree that they could in rotary wing aircraft. Higher\nresolution terrain data is required to test and possibly,\nachieve this capability.\nHead-up information, conformal information was\ndesired/preferred. The ability to use the SV/EV\ninformation and out-the-window was expressed.\nIt was also noted by the astronauts that the landing task\nwas going to be a \xe2\x80\x9ccrew effort.\xe2\x80\x9d The out-the-window\nvisual cues may not be critical for the commander (i.e.,\npilot-flying), because they will be part of the crew\xe2\x80\x99s\ntasking, where the pilot (i.e., pilot-not-flying), might\nvisually designate the landing zone and verify/validate\nthe navigation position accuracy.\n\nThe HWD showed significant potential in providing headup information while simultaneously showing hover cue\n(aided) guidance [41]. Those with previous familiarity with\nthe hover cue (e.g. helicopter pilots) especially showed\nproficiency using this combination. The combination of\nSV/EV information, head-up conformality, and appropriate\ncrew tasking suggest that a long pitch-up maneuver for\nnatural vision acquisition of the landing zone will not likely\nbe required.\n\nGlideslope\n\nFigure 12: HQRs of Glideslope and Guidance Variation\n(1.1 deg/s2 control power)\nIn general, the EPs preferred the aided condition, using the\nhover cue. The cue took some training (for those that didn\xe2\x80\x99t\nhave experience with it), but after training, the cue provided\nsome captures of the landing zone.\n\n15\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cmanual control\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cautomated control\xe2\x80\x9d is the physical\nprocess of activating the controller (i.e., whether it is a\nhuman or automation system at the controls). The system\nperformance and workload (i.e., handling qualities) during\nthis operation are still critically important.\n\nEffect of Control Power\xe2\x80\x94The data \xe2\x80\x93 the pilot ratings and\ncomments \xe2\x80\x93 clearly indicate that increasing control power\nproduces better handling qualities. For the Apollo-type\nconfigurations (2-jet and 4-jet Apollo RCS with 4.3 and 8.6\ndeg/s2 angular acceleration), Level 1 ratings were generally\ngiven. On some evaluations, some improvement was still\nwarranted with the higher control power configurations.\nThese poorer ratings were due primarily from display\ndeficiencies where improvements were desired.\n\nHuman-Centered Automation\nHistory has shown that the best automation designs are\nhuman-centered. They are designed understanding the\nhuman needs and limitations in monitoring, intervention,\nand adaptation with automation.\n\nControl powers at 1.6 deg/s2 and below are borderline Level\n2-3 or Level 3. Even though desired performance may be\nachievable with these configurations, and some \xe2\x80\x9cgood\xe2\x80\x9d\nLevel 2 ratings were given, cliff-like characteristics are\napparent in these configurations. If the EP fell behind the\ntask, made an inadvertent input, or committed a control\nreversal, they could find themselves struggling to get back\nto the landing zone. Pilot ratings of 8, 9, and 10 were\nindicative of these conditions.\n\nHuman-centered automation design principles are many and\nvaried (e.g., see [44]). Three key principles for humanautomation interaction are directly related to the handling\nqualities process and must be addressed:\n1) The automation must be observable by its human\noperator (i.e., the human operator is appropriately\ninformed).\n\nApproach Phase Piloting Task Influence\xe2\x80\x94Stringent\napproach performance criteria were not in effect with the\nexception of the \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t hover,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t climb\xe2\x80\x9d vertical\ndescent rate requirement. This procedure may have allowed\nsome of the \xe2\x80\x9cless than desirable\xe2\x80\x9d configurations to achieve\n\xe2\x80\x9creasonable\xe2\x80\x9d landing performance which may have biased\nthe ratings toward better ratings - the EPs were able to solve\nthe conundrum presented by these sluggish configurations.\n\n2) The current and near-term future behaviors of the\nautomation must be comprehensible, understood and\npredictable by the human operator.\n3) The automation must be contextually appropriate for\nits application, designed to complement the human\noperator, and not automated just because it is\npossible.\n\nThe EPs learned that THC control inputs could modulate the\namount of time available to them to complete the approach\nand landing. If handling issues became apparent, they could\nuse the THC to reduce their rate of descent, in essence,\nbuying them more time to sort out the horizontal positioning\ncontrol problem. In many cases, desired landing\nperformance was achievable, even though the approaches\nwere far from optimal. However, these performance\ndifferences were evident in the fuel usage. Better handling\nconfigurations used less fuel.\n\nThese human-automation interaction issues are mirrored in\nthe lessons-learned from Apollo and their use of automated\nentry guidance and control [45]:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nMore work is needed in defining approach standards for the\ntask. It may be necessary and appropriate to establish\napproach corridors and approach speeds. The approach\nstandards might mimic a Landing Signal Officer, where an\nunstabilized or botched approach might warrant a \xe2\x80\x9cwaveoff\xe2\x80\x9d (i.e., trigger an abort) to avoid the possibility of damage\nto an existing lunar habitat.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n5. HANDLING QUALITIES FOR AUTOMATION\nOften, the importance of handling qualities is dismissed\nunder the premise that the task/mission objective will be met\nusing automated control. In fact, handling qualities or, at\nleast, the principles of the pilot-vehicle dynamic systems\nanalysis are critically important during automatic control.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cGuidance logic must be simple\xe2\x80\xa6 the more\ncomplicated the guidance logic, the more difficult the\nguidance is to monitor during the mission. The\nmonitoring difficulty complicates the development of\nthe monitoring procedures and increased the time\nrequired for flight-crew training.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe guidance logic should be compatible with a\nbackup or an alternate trajectory control procedures.\nThat is, once an anomaly is detected in the trajectory\ncontrol of the primary guidance system, an alternative\ntechnique must be available that will allow satisfactory\ntrajectory control to be implemented so that the\nspacecraft will land near the originally selected target.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe interaction between guidance system performance\nand attitude control system performance must be\nrecognized. Realistic attitude control system response\nrequirements must be established, and guidance-logic\ndesign must minimize the need for rapid response.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nHQ Evaluations For Human-Centered Automation\nThe handling qualities of automated tasks (i.e., humanautomation interface requirements) should be evaluated in\nthree ways:\n\nHuman-automation interface requirements flow from\n\xe2\x80\x9cmanual control\xe2\x80\x9d handling qualities. Handling qualities are\nthe design and evaluation of the pilot-vehicle dynamic\nsystem (Figure 1); the only fundamental difference between\n16\n\n1)\n\n2)\n\n3)\n\nresponse as the pilot performs the required operation or task.\n\nPilots should conduct handling qualities of all tasks to\nbe flown by the automation. This is not to imply that\nthese tasks could or should be manually flown. But by\nconducting these evaluations, the pilot gains an\nappreciation of what the automation must do to\nsuccessfully control the vehicle. This knowledge is\ncritical for understanding the behavior of the\nautomation and what the pilot must do in the event\n(likely or unlikely) that they need or want to intervene\nor take-over. This task also defines what information\n(e.g., out-the-window visual cues or displays) are\nneeded by the human to monitor, control, or interact\nwith the automation.\n\nThe handling qualities implications of design decisions are\ndemonstrated using these pilot-in-the-loop evaluations of\ndocking operations and lunar landings. A general trend,\nnoted in both proximity operations and docking and lunar\nlanding, is that superior handling qualities generally results\nin lower fuel expenditure during the task. Data to support\ncontrol and display requirements are given based on task\nperformance and workload.\nThe importance of handling qualities is sometimes\ndismissed under the premise that the task/mission objectives\nwill be met using automated control. It is argued that\nhuman-automation interface requirements flow from\n\xe2\x80\x9cmanual control\xe2\x80\x9d handling qualities. Therefore, handling\nqualities are still critically important and these principles\nshould be closed adhered to.\n\nClassic handling qualities evaluations must also be\nconducted in scenarios where, during the conduct of\nautomated tasks, the pilot takes control of the vehicle\nand completes the task or temporarily intervenes and\nthen re-engages the automation. This task evaluates the\nability of the crew to interrupt the automation and the\npotential for upsets or discontinuities in the automation\nduring this process. It also demonstrates the pilot\xe2\x80\x99s\ncomprehension and understanding of the automation.\n\nREFERENCES\n[1] Cooper, G.E., and Harper Jr., R.P.: \xe2\x80\x9cUse of Pilot\nRating in the Evaluation of Aircraft Handling\nQualities.\xe2\x80\x9d NASA TN D-5153, April 1969.\n\nFinally, handling qualities evaluations must be\nconducted in scenarios where, during the conduct of\nautomated tasks, the automation unexpectedly fails\n(passively or actively) and the pilot must intervene or\ntake control of the vehicle and complete the task.\n\n[2] Bailey, R.E., Jackson, E.B., Bilimoria, K., Mueller, E.,\nFrost, C., and Alderete, T.: \xe2\x80\x9cCooper-Harper\nExperience Report for Spacecraft Handling Qualities\nApplications,\xe2\x80\x9d NASA Langley Research Center,\nHampton, VA, NASA/TM-2009-215767, May 2009.\n\nThere has yet to be realized an automation design or\nimplementation which is fool-proof and perfect.
