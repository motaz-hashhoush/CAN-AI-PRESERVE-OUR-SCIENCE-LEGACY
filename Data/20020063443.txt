But how about for launch\nvehicles, spacecraft control systems, range\ncontrol\xe2\x80\x94even entire commercial spaceports?\nLocated on the Space Coast of Florida, the\nCommand and Control Technologies (CCT)\nCorporation of Titusville provides high-technology\ncomputer system development and other services to\nthe space transportation industry. Over the past 15\nyears, CCT engineers have been tapped for involvement in both piloted Space Shuttle and expendable\nrocket operations. More recently, the company\nassisted in upgrading the Space Shuttle launch\ncontrol system.\nKennedy Space Center\xe2\x80\x99s spacecraft ground\nprocessing program is known as the Control\nMonitor Unit (CMU). Capabilities of this program\ninclude processing equipment test data for calibration and diagnosis, controlling the operation of\nequipment in real-time, simulating the operation of\nthe equipment, and processing large streams of\nmeasurement data.\nThis space center processing technology has been\nsignificantly adapted by CCT for use in the com-\n\nCommand and\nControl Technologies\nCorporation\xe2\x80\x99s\nCommand and\nControl Toolkit\xe2\x84\xa2\ndisplays such\ninformation as engine\npropellant status.\n\n74\n\nComputer Technology\n\nmercial sector. The processing program has been\nlicensed and commercialized through CCT. The\ncompany is now marketing the technology to the\npublic under the name Command and Control\nToolkit\xe2\x84\xa2.\nCCT and NASA signed a copyright license\nagreement in late 1997 to commercialize the\ncopyrighted CMU software. The agreement calls for\nNASA to license the copyrighted CMU software to\nCCT in return for royalties and other considerations. The company estimates it will recoup the\nroughly $3 million that NASA has already incurred\non design and development of the CMU program.\nThe agreement grants CCT exclusive rights to sell\nthe program to new commercial customers in the\nU.S. launch vehicle industry.\nNASA and CCT are also using the technology\nfor creating new Space Shuttle checkout and\nlaunching products and procedures that are being\nput in place. An advanced portable payload tester\nprototype, for instance, is undergoing evaluation.\nCapable of being transported to a payload customer\nsite, the mobile system can reduce processing time\nand cost at the launch site by readying spacecraft\n\nCommercial Benefits\xe2\x80\x94Spinoffs\n\nCommand and\nControl Technologies\nCorporation\xe2\x80\x99s\nCommand and\nControl Toolkit\xe2\x84\xa2\ndisplays a variety of\ninformation\nregarding engine\nstatus.\n\nmore quickly for flight. These virtues are essential for\nquick turnaround of payloads for 21st century reusable\nlaunch vehicles.\nThe CCT Command and Control Toolkit\xe2\x84\xa2\napplications are many, including checkout of launch\nvehicle control systems, range control, ground\nsupport equipment control and monitoring, avionics\nintegration and testing, avionics simulations, satellite\ncheckout, and telemetry processing. The toolkit\nenables CCT to produce custom command and\ncontrol systems at commercial off-the-shelf prices.\nCCT has used the toolkit to design a low-cost\nspaceport control system for the nation\xe2\x80\x99s first operational launch facility, located in southwest Alaska, not\nowned and operated by the federal government.\nCCT\xe2\x80\x99s toolkit has been used to automate range safety\nfunctions at the launch site, along with handling\nweather data, telemetry and data acquisition, and\ntrajectory planning.\n\nFurthermore, long-term commercial uses for the\ntoolkit are in the offing. These include the remote\nmonitoring of mobile operations, such as offshore oil\nplatforms. Also, remote land operation, using future\nwireless telecommunications satellite constellates, is\namong the potential toolkit applications.\nIn late 1998, NASA selected CCT for the Small\nBusiness Subcontractor of the Year Award. The\nrecognition was given to the firm for high technology, real-time software development and computer\nsystem design for launch processing and range\napplications at the Kennedy Space Center.\nCommand and Control Toolkit\xe2\x84\xa2 is a trademark of Command and Control Technologies\nCorporation\n\nComputer Technology\n\n75\n\n'
