To that end, the SST program seeks to:\n\n\u2022 Enable the execution of missions at much lower cost than previously possible.\n\n\u2022 Substantially reduce the time required for development of spacecraft, from authority to proceed until initial launch capability.\n\n\u2022 Enable and demonstrate new mission architectures that small spacecraft are uniquely suited for.\n\n\u2022 Expand the capability of small spacecraft to execute missions at new destinations and in challenging new environments.\n\n\u2022 Enable the augmentation of existing assets and future missions with supporting small spacecraft.\n\nThis paper will describe the NASA SSTP SmallSat Technology Partnerships (STP), completed and upcoming Missions Capability Demonstrations for technology demonstrations under SSTP1 and provides a synopsis of the leveraged investments under the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Program and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR). A brief overview of the Small Spacecraft Systems Virtual Institute (S3VI) and its current activities performed in conjunction with SSTP is also provided.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "GB", "submissionId": 20200003115, "endDate": "2020-04-28T04:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "SMi Group", "location": "Shawbury, United Kingdom"}}, "meetingId": "b64cea61be824c8882467a6509d90e04", "id": "c4983bc4225c46498f50b7a25a7fae8b"}], "name": "Small Satellites Conference 2020", "location": "London", "id": "b64cea61be824c8882467a6509d90e04", "url": "https://www.smi-online.co.uk/defence/uk/small-satellites", "startDate": "2020-04-27T04:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20200003115.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20200003115/downloads/20200003115.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20200003115/downloads/20200003115.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20200003115/downloads/20200003115.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
