The Space Shuttle Orbiter is being built by\nthe United States under the management of the National Aeronautics and Space\nAdministration (NASA).\nSpacelah is being designed to be a versatile laboratory capable of accommodating a variety of experiments. The pressurised Spacolab module provides\na shirt-sleeve environment in which up to four payload specialists can operate\nexperiments using the basic resources provided by the laboratory. Similarities between the method of experiment accommodation and operations planned for\nSpacelab and the methods u s ed in conducting experimentation aboard aircraft by\nthe Aines Airborne Science Office (ASO) led to thu jointly planned ASSESS\nMission using a CV-990 flying laboratory (Pig. 1). The mission was planned\nand carried out as an integral part of NASA\'S ongoing ASSESS Programme and\nincluded one week of simulated Soaceiah operation.\nData for this summary were obtained from three main sources: the records\nof a team of observers, a general debriefing following the simulation period,\nand individual interviews with mission participants. The report was prepared\njointly by NASA and ESA personnel associated with the mission.\nMISSION OBJECTIVES\nThe overall objective of the Joint ASSESS Mission was to evaluate a\nsimplified management and implementation concept for conducting Spacelab-like\nexperiment operations. The following contributory objectives were addressed\nin conducting the mission:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Experience involvement in international cooperative payload activities\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Evaluate experiment design approaches for Spacelah experiments\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Determine iinpact of operational requirements and procedurcs on Spacelab design\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Evaluate payload operations and ground integration of experiments\n\nAssess techniques for smooth integration of experiments and equipment\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Analyse factors affecting selection and training of payload specialists,\n\nparticularly in proxy experiment operntion\nThe Joint ASSESS Mission also served to encourage the development of a cadre\nof potential Spacelah experimenters. The mission did not address physiological\nor psychological factors.\nMISSION GUIDIThTNES\n\'Il-e following Spacelab-compatible mission guidelines were established:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Authentic science to he performed\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Six basic experiments to be operated (three European, three U.S.)\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Ames ASO practices to be used as starting point for mission planning\nant execution\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Participation of principal investigators (PIs) in overall mission to\nbe inaximised\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Four experiment operators (BUs, two Ruropean, two U.S.) to operate\nexperiments in proxy role (i.e., on behalf of the PIs)\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Simulation period to cover 5 days with a data flight each 24-hr period\n(experiments op-rated by BUs), with BUs and a Mission Manager confined to vehicle and living quarters\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Unconstrained flights to be conducted for 2 weeks following the simulation period (experiments operated by Pis)\n\xe2\x80\xa2 All supporting equipment, tools, and spare parts to be carried on\nboard\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Spacelab subsystems to be simulated where possible\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Use of experiment support equipment to he shared\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Communication to be limited to one video downlink, two 2-way voice\nlinks\n\n2\n\nMANAGEMUNT\nPolicy Managcment\nThe mission was officially planned and guided by a Mission Planning Group\n(MPG) consisting of representatives froin NASA and ESA Headquarters, Marshall\nSpace Plight Center, Johnson Space Center, and Ames Research Center.\nImplenieritation Management\nImplPlnentatiorL of the mission was carried out by the organis . tion shown\nin Figure 2. The NASA/ESA panel consisted of one representative from each\nagency, who was available to make top-level policy decisions involving agency\ninterests. The Mission Manager, provided by Ames, was the single point of\ncontact for all negotiations, decisions, and assistance in carrying out the\nmission from inception to completion. He ensured that all ASSESS activities\nwere carri\'d out in accord with the policies established by the MPG.\nA Mission Scientist was selected froi, the ASO i. work with the PIs during\nthe simulation period to help coordinate their overall requirements and\nnumber\nreduce the\nof interfacos with the Mission Manager.\nThe PIs were fully responsible for their own experiments throughout the\nmission, including design, testing, integration, and data taking. The EUs\nserved as the PI5T representatives in operating the equipment to obtain meaningful data during the simulation period.\nA ground-based Mission Operations Center, set up for the simulation\nperiod, housed the Mission Operations Manager, the PIs, the Mission Scientist,\nand the NASA/ESA panel. The center was directed by the Mission Operations\nManager.\nDOCUMENTAT 1 ON\n\nDocumentation used for the Joint ASSESS Mission was held to a minimum\nand consisted of:\n1. Control documents\nCV- 990 Experimenters\' Handbook\nMission Operating Plan\n2.\n\nImplementation documents\nTwo Experimenters\' Bulletins\nExperiment procedures and checklists\nApprovals by Airworthiness and Flight Safety Review Board\nFlight plans\nVarious Ames internal documents, such as shop orders, safety\ninspection records, and installation drawings\n\nEXPERIMENT SHLfl(I\'IQN AND DEVIIflPMENT\nof\nA nucleus\nthree European experiments was chosen on the grounds of\nscientific desirability and Spacelab compatibility.\nThis payload nucleus was\ncomplemented by the choice of three compatible U.S. experinnts. Overall\nexperimental objectives required that data flight ,, be made at night. The\nexprirnents and their sources are sununarisod in Figure 3. The sharing of\nbasic experiment hardware created complex requirements for prograBnned interchange of sensors on a priority basis by the UOs during the flight period,\njust as may be expected on Spacelab.\nThe Pis de1opcd their experiments at their home bases using the standard racks provided by the ASO and in accordance with guidelines furnished in\nthe ASO CV-990 Experimenters\' Handbook. A readiness review was held at each\nexperunentor location approximately 2 month ,, before the flight phnso of the\nmission.\n\n1XPERIMENT OPERATOR SELECTION AND TRAINING\n\nThe BUs, two Europeans and two Americans, were selected for their appropriate scientific backgrounds in astronomy and atmospheric physics, and represented a wide range of experience - from graduate science student to\nscientist/astronaut. Each P1 worked dircctly with the EUs to familiarise them\nwith the equipment and operation of his experiment. For each experiment, one\nEO was assigned primary responsibility, and one or more BUs were assigned\nsecondary responsibility. Primary responsibility included both proficient\nexperiment operation under nominal conditions, and ability to perform significant trouble shooting and repair. Secondary responsibility was limited to\nproficient operation under nominal conditions. Final training of the BUs at\npayload level took place during the experiment integration phase at Ames and\ninvolved ground activities and one aircraft flight. Total training tililo for\nthe individual BOs varied from 21 to 67 days.\n\nGROUND AND FLIGHT OPERATIONS\n\nIntegration of each experiment in itself was accomplished at the oxperirnonters\' home bases. Upon arrival at Ames, each experiment was subjected to\nincoming inspection for safety and airworthiness, after which it was integrated into the aircraft as a part of the total payload (Fig. 4). Several\ntimes during the mission (except during the simulation period), special electromagnetic interference (EMI) tests and inczsureincnts were made to help in\ndeveloping a shielding, isolation, and grounding philosophy for Spacelah\nequipment. Throe presimulation mission flights were conducted for equipment\ncheckout, since no ground support equipment (GSE) was provided for this\npurpose.\n\nThe constrained period simulating Spacelah flight begun on Monday,\nJune 2nd, at 13.00 hours and ended Saturday, Jme 7th at 23.30 hours. During\nthis period, the Mission Managcr and IOs flew each flight and remained confined\nto the aircraft and living quarters. The Wednesday flight w; cancelleddLK\'\nto aircraft problems, and it was decided to extend the simulation period by\none additional day to achieve the fifth planned flight. Following the constrained period two additional weeks were devoted to unconstrained flights\nwith experiment operation by the PIs themselves to complement the data\nobtained by the EOs and to permit comparison of E0 and P1 performance.\nDuring the simulation period, ground and flight operations were coordinated from the Mission. Operations Center. One formal l)riefiig and 0110 forinal\ndebriefing were held daily via the audio and video links. These briefings\nwere supplemented by informal PI/EO discussions using the same links.\nASSESS- SPACELAB SIMILARITIES\nInstallation and operation of a complex set of experiments aboard an\naircraft cannot totally simulate such a payload aboard Spacclab. However,\nthere are many similarities that permit mari>\' lessons to be learned relevant\nto Spacelah experiment planning and operation. Thso are summarised below:\nSpacelab Mission\n\nASSESS Mission\n\nSignificant experiments to be conducted from Spacelah\n\nAuthentic science conducted from\naircraft\n\nFixed countdown to liftoff\n\nRigid schedule to takeoff\n\nOrbiter and Spacelab operations to\nbe separated\n\nAircraft and experiment operations\nseparated\n\nEssential services (power, environment, etc.) and standard equipment\nfittings (racks, windows) to be\nprovided\n\nPower and shirt - sleeve atmosphere\nprovided; standard racks and\nmodified windows available\n\nControl and data management system\n(CDMS) to be provided\n\nAirborne digital data acquisition\nsystem (ADDAS) provided\n\nLargo weight and volume capability\nto be provided\n\nvolume\nprovided\nAmple weight and\nfor Spacclab simulation\n\nPayload specialists to perforrn\nexperiments; mission specialist to\ncontrol resources\n\nExperiment operators performed\nexperiments; Mission Manager controlled resources\n\nRelatively benign environment to\npermit use of laboratory-type\nequipment\n\nOnly slightly modified laboratory\nequipment used\n5\n\n_j1aMission (cont.)\t\n\nASSESS Mission (cont.)\n\n-\n\nShort development times planned for\nSpacolab\n\nLess than 1 year schcduledfor ASSESS\nexperiment development and flight\n\nPayload specialists and mission\nspecialist to be zonfined to\nOrb.tor/naco1ah for 7 days\n\nExperiment operators and Mission\nManager confined for 5 days\n\nSimpl i fied ground operations\nplanned\n\nVery simple acceptance and experiment integration procedures used\n\nCommon test equipment and tools to\nbe available\n\nCommon test equipment and tools\nused\n\nConiiunication to be provided\n\nTV 1.own1ink and bidirectional\nvoice link operational during the\nperiods the aircraft was on ground\n\nbetween payload specialist and PIs\non the ground through TV downlink\nand bidirectional voice link\nExperiment facilities to be used\nby more than one group of\ninvestigators\n\nDetectors changed at focal plane\nof cominon toles\'opes\n\nMISSION RESULTS\nThe Joint ASSESS Mission provided valuable scientific and engineering\ndata that will not only enhance scientific knowledge but will also provide\nsound guidelines for the design and operation of future Spacelab experiments.\nThe mission also provided an opportunity for participants to experience an\nenvironment similar to that which will exist prior to and during an actual\nSpacelab flight.\nPIs and EOs alike voiced strong satisfaction with their mission experience and education. Their comments are reflected i. the following evaluation\nof the mission.\nScientific Data\nScientific results of the mission will be reported by the PIs in the\nrelevant scientific literature. All PIs reported obtaining good data, particularly on the following topics:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nthe IR source around the star p Ophiuchi\nthe IR and the near-UV spectra of Venus\nthe near-UV spectra of blue-type stars in Scorpius\nthe near-UV and IR spectra of the earth\'s upper atmosphere\n-both twilight and nighttime airglow\n\n6\n\n-selected features of atmospheric constituents\nozone absorptions\n\nllorzberg lands of 02\nNO concentration\n011 cloud structure\n-both broad survey spectra and Ji hroo1ution scans in limited\nregions\nThe sun, the moon, and the diffuse nebula M- 7 were iised as calibration\nObj ccts.\nManagement\nAs in previous missions conducted by the ASO, this mission was directed\nsuccessfully by the Mission Manager acting as the single point of contact for\nthe activities of the PIs and flOs throughout the entire period from oxporirnoilt\npreparation through science flights. Although the workload created by the\nunusual aspects of the simulation mission at times was taxing, the Mission\nManager and his assistant nevertheless effectively provided the direct communications necessary for a steam1inod operation so that only minimum dou\nmontation was required.\nExperiment and Related flguipnont Performance\nSome initial problems were encountered, but in all cases good experiment\nperformance was achieved before the end of the mission. Sons of these problems were related to the aircraft (e.g., aerodynamic buffeting of open-port\ntelescope) and would not occur in Spacelab. Spacelah-rolated problems wore\ntypically:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Electromagnetic interference (iMI) affected the performance of some\nexperiments; however, problems of this kind gradually were solved\nduring the mission.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Eland guidance of a 20-cm telescope proved not feasible; the problem\nwas solved after the simulation period through utilisation of a\ngyrostabiliscd mirror system.\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nInternal misalignment of optics was observed on one of the experiments; a time-consuming realignment was required.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThe centralised data management system interface posed some problems\ninitially because debugging of the total system could not \'turt until\nthe full payload had been integrated (no data system simu. itor was\navailable).\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nSonic experiment mounts were disqualified by the ASO airworthiness\npersonnel, and had to he re-engineered and rebuilt at Ames. The\nproblem resulted partly from incomplete information in the CV- 990\nHandbook and partly from the fact that on-site safety reviews could\nnot be held earlier in the prcgranuuo duo to budget constraints.\n\nflxI)erinlcnt design and arrungcment within the aircraft did n)t I)cnnit\noptimum simultaneous operat on.\nxJpIentQ[1tor Performance\nIn principle, the concept of proxy cxperiiiiciit op(rat 1 C)fl was _uccessibl.\nHowever, it was noticed that the thno ri\'qui rcd to adapt to the aircraft\ncnvironment(noise, lighting, habitability) was directly related to the\nexperience of the lOs. Shortcomings in the training programme were recognised\nby most of the EUs and the PIS. 11se shortcomings did curtail L() efficiency,\nparticularly during he early part of the mission, and a distinct learning\ncurve was noted.\nThe onboard activities wore, in fact, quite complcx and dmaiiLi ing, and\nresulted in a very high workload Or the operators. Or this reason, the PIS\nsome\nsignificantly reduced the number of experimental parameters 111\ncases to\nallow the iOs to accomplish a reasonable degree or success. During the unconstrained period, the Pis, with their instnnncni io J 1 huity and greater inan\npowor support, were able to accomplish the fl 1 sc,ontilic objectives.\nA striking aspect 01 the Mission ws t V , t. flf\')s were ;ihlc to successfully perform maintenance and repair te \t\ncontributed significantly to\nthe good working order of the cquipnicii . \t\niince from the PIS, during the\nconference periods, was particularly 11clp di in this respect.\nThe LOs agreed that, in flight, the Mission Manager provided a valuable\nlink with the aircraft sul)systcIT. support, and it was apparent that he played\nrole\nan important resource management\nin addition to his other tasks.\n\nLESSONS LEAflNJil) FOR SPACELB\n\nThe Joint ASSESS Mission illustrated that a low-cost pogranm10 with a\nlow level of preparatory requirements, testing, and documentation can operate\nsuccessfully under the proper management approach. Appropriate and timely\ninformation on constraints and capabilities, as well as guidelines for hardware development, do enhance the chances for success. It can he concluded\nlow-cost programmes such as those envisaged for Spaceluh can he successprogranes\nfully implemented, under the right conditions.\nIt was evident from the ASSESS mission that an aircraft can serve as an\nexcellent platform for optimising the methodology, design, and operations\naspects of experiments conceived for Spacelah. This observation is particularly relevant when these experiments are still in an embryonic stage and\nbefore large amounts of development time and money have been expended.\nLessons learncd for Space1ab in specific areas are outlined below. Some\nunderline expcicnce that is familiar to participants from the NASA manned\nspace programme but may be new to the Puropeans.\n\n8\n\nSimplified Inanaemont techniques can be & \'f\'et: ively applied to experiment\ndeve 1\t\nnt , integration, and operations with a low 1 ve 1 of iiped ;pe i !i\ncation, and testing, resulting in relatively low cost, if the part ic iJ)ant;\nare corii1 etent an\'l are strongly motivated.\nA small p1 inn i ng group with representation from each appropriate participating organisation is effective in establishing policy and guidelines for\nmission implementation.\nA Mission Manager with adequate authority ean efective1y CxecLItc the\nauthoi\'ity\npolicies of the planning group and act as the Sini point of contact for the\n111a11gC1flQflt of all ni.sioii integration act ivities, Suth a i1er must have\nthe appropriate background to understand experim.int objct iv- and instriununIfr hu1d have a .snvil, 1\ntation, and intorexperiment and carrier interfices\t\nbut competent staff to which he can delegate ic 1 spons ibi 1 ty for details. To\nnL1re effective coordination througY all phases of the 1i1is.4icn, the Mission\nManager should not normally fly 011 \'.ce1ah.\nThe application of ASO practices to the Joint ASShSS Mission was geners\nally successful, and tho e tecliniquos should forni a basis for the planning u\nSpaeelab payloads and operations. As expected, however, the added cornplexi ty\nof Space1abtype operations does call for somewhat more rigid and formal\narrangements thn those normally associated with airborne payloads. In particular, a comprehensive implementation plan that details day-to-day activi ties is essential.\nReliance on the P1 for the development of his own experirnnt provides a\nhigh degree of motivation to ensure successful delivery and operation of the\nhardware. Free contact between the P1 and other mission participants (via\nthe Mission Manager) encourages thc successful conclusion of these activities.\nSome limited formal review of experiment progress is needed, however.\nRelatively small amounts of control and interface documents and proceduros suffice to ensure a successful low-cost mission, as long as the requirewants are clearly specified. To be effective, this simplified docuinentation\napproach requires clear delegation of responsibilities to participants and\nquick and efficient communication among team members.\nExperiment Equipment\nEarly in the development of experiment equipment, the design of individual\ncomponents must be guided by the fact that each experiment will be operated as\nan integral part of the total payload.\nPayload specialists can nuke significant contributions to experiment\ndesign, particularly in the area of equipment operation, if they become\ninvolved sufficiently early in the design process.\n\n9\n\nElectromagnetic compatibility (I3tC) engineering should be considered as\ni basic requirement throughout the Spacelab payload design process.\nAlthough the use of off-the-shelf equipment is encouraged, some minimal\nstandard of performance should\t\nestablished to avoid the low reliability\nthat was noticed in some minor items, such as strip chart recorders.\nWith no limitations imposed cn power, volume, and weight, the demands of\navailable eqapment can be quite high. Por exarnple, on he ASSESS flights the\nvalues of these quantities were as follows:\nVolume: 10\n\nrn\n\nWeight: 1700 kg\nPower:\t\n\n3 watts/kg\n\nAlthough these values could be reduced by state-of-the-art advances, off-theshelf equipment used on Spacelab may still require modification to satisfy\npayload constraints,\nMinor (but time- consuming) activities, such as switching, should be\nautomated to permit FuU concentration on the real experiment operation.\nAll experiments should include displays that indicate proper operation.\nCryogenic support for experiments should be included in any general provisioning support system developed for Spacelab. On ASSESS, significant\nproblems were encountered with experimenter-provided cryogenic equipment.\nysterns\nFour minicomputers were provided as part of the experiment equipment,\ndespite the availability of the AIJDAS on the CV-990. This suggests that the\nSpacelab CIJMS capabilities for interfacing with minicomputers have to be\ninvestigated further. The tendency of experimenters to provide their own\nminicomputers suggests that the need for CDMS for basic recording and computation may not be as groat as originally anticipated. At the same time,\nASSESS emphasised the very real need for centralised handling of houskeeping\ndata.\nIntegration of experiments with the CV-990 data iirnagement system and its\nassociated software presented problems on ASSESS. This area can be expected\nto be problematic with Spacelab as well, and will require special and timely\nattention.\nGround-based processing of ccjentjfjc data contributes significantly to\nsuccssfu1 proxy operation of exp;ri1nents when large amounts of Oita have to\nbe evaluated.\nDuring tracking and pointing operations, a dedicated keyboard and display\nis required. It Is questionable whether time sharing of a single keyboard and\ndisplay by several users can provide satisfactory results.\n10\n\nSuppression of Spacelab-generated EMI is an important design consideration. In this context, the CDMS is a major potential contributor because of\nits intimate interfaces with experiments. The single-point grounding\nphilosophy represents a good approach for Spacelab (and experiment) design.\nPayload Planning, Integration, and Operations\nTime line compatibility and observation conip;tibi1ity for experiment\noperation are important factors in the choice of Spacelab payloads.\nCoilunorI usage of equipment calls for careful planning, including the provision of backup items in the event of malfunctions.\nInvolvement of the experimenter in the integration procedure contributos\nto the efficiency of the process.\nFirm management of cquipmcnt/stowage is necessary to ensure that all\nessential items are brought on board, non-ossential items are excluded, and\nstowage is arranged to facilitate equipment usage in Eli-ht.\nGood inetal workshop and erectronic laboratory facilities should be provided for support of level 11 and level 111 integration.\nPre-integration of experiments (level TV and some level 111) in Europe is\ntechnically feasible.\nProxy operation of experiments is a workable concept, providing that the\nappropriate operators are chosen and adequate training is provided.\nA downlink TV capability will be important for occasional repair tasks,\nbut probably will not be required frequently for normal Spacelah experinunt\noperation.\nExperiment setup times and procedures can represent a major part of\nexperiment operation and must be considered in developing the mission\ntime lines.\nNominal experiment operations should not require real-time communications\nwith ground-based Ms. However, PI/payload specialist conferences should be\nscheduled on a regular basis, and planning should be sufficiently flexible to\nallow for additional cor ierences to cover any unforeseen problems that may\narise.\nPayload specialists should not be normally responsible for subsystem\noperation and maintenance, but should concentrate fully on payload operation.\nLO Selection and Training\nSelection and training of payload specialists for Spacelab missions will\nbe critical elements in the overall success of the mission. From the unique\n\n11\n\nED/PI relationship evaluated during the joint ASSESS mission, it is apparent\nthat:\nThe Spacelab payload crew should he specialists who can interpret the\ndata and can develop an intuitive feeling for the measurements. They\nshould understand the experiment and its objectives and should have\nsufficiently detailed knowledge of electro-mochanical aspects of\nexperiment hardware to permit trouble shooting and correction as\nwarranted.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Some paylouu speLi3list participation in experiment development, integration, and payload checkout phases of his primary experiment(s) is\nrocjt.iircd. Therefore, payload specialists should he selected at the\nappropriate time to enable theiii to participate during these phases\nwith their primary experiments.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Payload specialist training should he well planned and organised as\nan integral part of the total mission, and should include substantial\ntraining at payload level for which adequate equipment is required to\nfully exercise the man-machine interface.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Limited pre-mission flights of the ASSESS EOs and payload was an\nimportant factor in their training, adjustment to environment, and\novercuning latent snags. This experience suggests that Spacclah payloacl, specialists will benefit from aircraft flights with their equipment or some equivalent form of integrated mission simulation.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The development of a payload specialist/PI team relationship is\nessential vo successful proxy experiment operation.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Mission simulations should include practice in payload specialist/P1\ncommunication under realistic conditions.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 A marked improvement in EO performance was noted as the simulation\nperiod advanced, implying that both training (learning and practice)\nand extended flight duration are important aspects of Spacolab operation. In addition, at least one payload crcwrnan should be w11 trained\nin maintaining facility equipment\nFINAL REMARKS\nThe objectives of the Joint ASSESS Mission were purposely limited to\nobtain the most meaningful results. It should bi noted that guidelines for\nthis mission were selected before the capabilities of Spacelab and its\nresources were finalised. In addition, the mission was designed for compatibility with the limiting conditions provided by the CV-990 aircraft and its\nsupport equipment. Consequently, in planning any future Spaceiah simulation\nmission, modification of the mission objectives and guidelines will have to\nbe considered tc meet new conditions.\n12\n\n\t\n\nNASA/ESA PANEL\n\nCO4tAND\nPILOT\nLJ\n\nMISSION\nMANAGER\n(on board)\n\nMISSION\nSCIENTIST\n\nPRINCIPAL\nINVESTI GATORS\n\nMISSION\nOPERATIONS\nMANAGER\n(on ground)\n\t\nAIRCRAFT \t\nMISSION\nSERVICE\n\nEXPERIMENTER\nSUPPORT\n\n\t\nFLIGHT \t\nPLANNERS\n\nEXPERIMENT\t\nOPERATORS\n\nFigure 2.- Joint ASSESS niission irilemerttation organisation.\n\n-J\n\nORGAN1SAT1ON\t\n\nINSTRLWYfI3NThTIOft\t\n\nASU111T\n\n30-cm Cassegrain\t\ntelescope with\t\nfilter wheel IR\t\nphotometer\nCooled Go bolometer\n\nHigh-resolution mapping\nof dark clouds and 1111\nregions\n\nQueen Mary College\t\n\nPolarising interfero,ii- \t\neter\t\nCooled Go boloineter\n\nIR emission spectrum of\nupper atmosphere\n\nUniversity of\t\nSouthampton\t\n\nImaging Isocon TV\t\ncamera\t\nIR photometer\nAll-sky camera\n\nObservation of 011\nair1ow clouds\n\nNASA/AMES Research\t\nCenter\t\n\n30-cm Cassegrain tele-\t\nscope (Meuclon) with\t\nvariable filter-\t\nwedge spectrometer\nCooled in Sb detector\n\nNear IR spectra of\nVenus and Late type\nstars\n\nNASA/Jet Propulsion\nLaboratory\n\nTunable acousto- optical\nfilter spectrometers\n(2) with telescopes\n\nUniversity of Alaska\n\n1-rn Ebert-Fastie\nspectrometer-telescope\nand stabilised mirror\n\nUV and visible measurements of atmospheric\ntransparency, solar\nflux, planetary atmospheres, and interstellar molecules\n\nUniversity of Colorado\n\n12.5-cm Ebert-Fastie UV\nspectrometer\n\nObservatoire de Meudon \t\nCNRS-Verriers\t\nUniversity of Groningen\t\n\nUniversity of New Mexico 35-mni camera with IR \t\nimage intensifier\t\n16-mm camera with image\nintensifier for timelapse photography\nIR photometer\n\nIR photography of 01-1\nairglow clouds\n\nFigure 3. - Experiments for CV-990 NASA/ESA ASSESS mission.\n\n15\n\n'
