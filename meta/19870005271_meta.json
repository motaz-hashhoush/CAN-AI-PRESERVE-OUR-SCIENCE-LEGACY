The hold-down includes numerous holes in the support surface, through which a vacuum is applied from a vacuum source. The holes are arranged in zones. The vacuum is repeatedly interrupted at only one or a few zones, while it continues to be applied to other zones, to allow the workpiece to creep along that interrupted zone. The vacuum to different zones is interrupted at different times, as by a slowly turning valve number, to allow each zone of the workpiece to creep. A positive pressure may be applied from a pressured air source to a zone when the vacuum is interrupted there, to help lift the corresponding workpiece zone off the surface to aid in creeping. The workpiece may undergo dimensional changes because of heating, cooling, drying, or other procedure.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19870005271, "id": "f4cd70870d8b4ac792486ddf7ae2cd5e", "publicationDate": "1986-10-21T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19870005271.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19870005271/downloads/19870005271.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19870005271/downloads/19870005271.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19870005271/downloads/19870005271.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
