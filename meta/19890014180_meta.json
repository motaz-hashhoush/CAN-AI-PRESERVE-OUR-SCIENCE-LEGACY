Additional studies are required to develop an exposure methodology which will assure that accelerated testing can be used for qualification of materials and coatings for long duration space flight. Some conclusions are listed: Solar UV radiation is present in all orbital environments; Solar UV does not change in flux with orbital altitude; UV radiation can degrade most coatings and polymeric films; Laboratory UV simulation methodology is needed for accelerated testing to 20 UV solar constants; Simulation of extreme UV (below 200 nm) is needed to evaluate requirements for EUV in solar simulation.", "title": "Ultraviolet radiation effects", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-05T23:52:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19890014180, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Slemp, Wayne S."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Langley Research Center", "location": "Hampton, VA, United States"}}, "id": "4fba799e8b9b4e7da3f3c3a4052ec9d0"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19890014180, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19890014180, "id": "8a3c0b645d944594a5a364e53dce3d86", "publicationName": "NASA(SDIO Space Environmental Effects on Materials Workshop, Part 2", "publicationDate": "1989-05-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19890014180.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19890014180/downloads/19890014180.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19890014180/downloads/19890014180.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19890014180/downloads/19890014180.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
