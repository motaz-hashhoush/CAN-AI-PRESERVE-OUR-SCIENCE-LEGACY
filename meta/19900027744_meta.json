Recent significant advances in CST include stochastic-based modeling, strategies for performing large-scale structural calculations on new computing systems, and the integration of CST with other disciplinary modules for multidisciplinary analysis and design. New methodologies have been developed at NASA for integrated fluid-thermal structural analysis and integrated aerodynamic-structure-control design. The need for multiple views of data for different modules also led to the development of a number of sophisticated data-base management systems. For CST to play a role in the future development of structures technology and in the multidisciplinary design of future flight vehicles, major advances and computational tools are needed in a number of key areas.", "title": "Computers boost structural technology", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-14T09:46:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19900027744, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Noor, Ahmed K."}, "organization": {"name": "George Washington University", "location": "Washington, DC, United States"}}, "id": "5b0689c2a5f94ecb93fe0d3b6173bf76"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19900027744, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Venneri, Samuel L."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Materials and Structures Div.", "location": "Washington, DC, United States"}}, "id": "245178ed6c0f404e8fe053b189c72f41"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Reprint (Version printed in journal)", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-18T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19900027744, "publications": [{"volume": "27", "submissionId": 19900027744, "issn": "0740-722X", "id": "a4ac3ef6b4bf422fac501e643daed95f", "publicationName": "Aerospace America", "publicationDate": "1989-11-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
