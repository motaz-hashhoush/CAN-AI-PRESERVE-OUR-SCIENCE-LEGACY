Croom\nNASA Langley Research Center\n\nINTRODUCTION\nAircraft\ntrailing\nvortices\nare one of the principal\nfactors\naffecting\naircraft\narrival\nand departure\nrates at airports.\nMinimization\nof the\ntrailed\nvortex strength\nwould allow reduction\nof the present spacing\nrequirements.\nSuch reductions\nwould allow full\nutilization\nof advances\nin automatically\naided landing\nsystems as described\nin reference\n1, while\nmaintaining\nor improving\nsafety within\nthe terminal\narea.\nFor several\nyears,\nNASA has been conducting\nan intensive\nin-house and contractual\nresearch effort\ninvolving\ntheoretical\nand experimental\nstudies\nof various\nwake vortex minimization\ntechniques,\nthe results\nof which were reported\nin reference\n2. NASA's work was done in conjunction\nwith the Federal\nAviation\nAdministration\ninvestigation\nof various\nsensing devices for\ndetecting\nthe presence of vortices\nwithin\nthe terminal\narea.\nThe FAA's\n' investigation\nis aimed at developing,\nfor installation\nat major airports,\na vortex avoidance system that would increase\nrunway capacity\nby varying\nthe separation\ndistances\nto conform to the conditions\npresent.\nA complete\nground-based\ndetecting\nsystem would involve\nthe detection\nand prediction\nof the presence and strength\nof the vortices\npresent at a given time.\nBoth the NASA effort\nfor vortex reduction\nand the FAA effort\nfor detection\naid the overall\nnational\nair transportation\ngoal to alleviate\naircraft\ntrailing\nvortices\nas an operational\nconstraint.\nThe purpose of this paper\nis to review the NASA effort.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL\nMETHODS\nShown in figure\n1 are the experimental\nfacilities\nthat have been used to\nevaluate\nthe various\nvortex minimization\nconcepts.\nPictured\nare the four\nprimary model test facilities\nthat have been used along with flight\ntests.\nFor all tests,\nthe basic operational\nproblem of one airplane\nflying\nin\ntrail\nbehind another and encountering\nthe vortex wake is recreated.\nThe\nprimary model test facilites\nemploy the experimental\nmethod illustrated\nin figure\n2. The vortex upset potential\non the trailing\naircraft\nis\ndetermined\nby measuring the vortex-induced\nrolling\nmoment on a trailing\nairplane.\nFor the vortex minimization\ntests,\nthe vortex generator\naircraft\nhas generally\nbeen representative\nof a wide-body jet while the vortex\npenetrator\nhas been either\na small jet transport\n(DC-g) or a business jet\nsize airplane\n(Learjet\nor T-37).\nThe vortex minimization\nconcepts are\n\n757\n\nimplemented on the transport\nairplane\nwhile measurements are made to assess\nthe performance\ndegradation\nattributable\nto the vortex minimization\nscheme.\nMeasurement of the vortex induced rolling\nmoment on the trailing\nairplane\nprovides\na direct\nmeasurement of the effectiveness\nof the vortex\nminimization\nconcept.\nThe wind tunnels\nused for the model tests are the 40- by 80-foot\ntunnel\nat Ames Research Center and the V/STOL tunnel at Langley Research Center.\nIn addition\nto these two wind tunnels,\ntwo model towing facilities\nwere\nused.\nIn these facilities,\nboth the vortex generator\nmodel and the\ntrailing\nrolling\nmoment model are towed through a quiescent\nfluid\nmedium.\nIn one of these facilities\n(vortex\nflow facility)\nlocated\nat Langley Research\nCenter, the models are towed through the air,\nand in the other facility,\nthe models are towed in a water basin.\nTests in the water towing basin\nwere conducted under contract\nto Hydronautics,\nInc.\nThe model facilities\nprovide for downstream measurements of the vortex wake from very near field\nto as much as 2 scale miles behind the vortex generator\naircraft.\nAdditional\ndetails\nconcerning\nthese facilities\ncan be found in reference\n3.\nEXPERIMENTAL RESULTS\nlrlake vortex minimization\nexperiments\nhave shown that significant\nreduction\nin the vortex-induced\nrolling\nmoment on a trailing\nairplane\ncan be achieved\nprimarily\nby increasing\nthe normal dissipation\nrate by using turbulence\nto\nThe experiments\nhave indicated\nseveral\nrapidly\ndiffuse\nthe vorticity.\nmethods of increasing\nturbulent\ndiffusion\neither\ndirectly\nby turbulence\ninjection\nor indirectly\nthrough vortex interaction.\nThe following\nsections\nbriefly\ndescribe\nthese methods.\nTurbulence\n\nInjection\n\nShown in figure\n3 is a device which was flight\ntested on a C-54 airplane\nto investigate\nthe effect\nof turbulence\ninjection\non the vortex wake.\nThe\ndevice,\nas illustrated,\nconsisted\nof considerable\nflat-plate\narea normal\nto the free stream to produce turbulence\nnear the wingtip.\nThe device\ndid not alter\nthe wing lift\ncharacteristics\nbut added an increment of drag.\nThe device increased\nthe basic airplane\ndrag coefficient\nby about 0.05.\nThe flight-test\nresults\nof the device are reported\nin reference\n4 and shown\nin figure\n4. The flight\ntest consisted\nof flying\na PA-28 Cherokee airplane\nin the C-54 airplane\nvortex wake at various\nseparation\ndistances\nwith and\nAs shown in figure\n4, without\nwithout\nthe turbulence\ndevice on the C-54.\nthe turbulence\ndevice on the C-54 airplane,\nthe PA-28 airplane\ncould\npenetrate\nno closer\nthan 8 km before the roll-control\ncapability\nof the\nHowever, the turbulence\ninjection\ndevice\nPA-28 airplane\nwas exceeded.\ncaused a visible\nalteration\nof the vortex pattern\nwhich was marked with\n\n758\n\nsmoke (reference\n4) and significantly\nreduced the vortex-induced\nrolling\nmoment. As shown in figure\n4, the vortex;induced\nroll was always lower\nthan the roll-control\ncapability\nof the PA-28 airplane.\nThese flight\ntests were the first\nquantitative\nindication\nthat wake vortex effects\ncould be significantly\nreduced.\nIt is recognized\nthat the implementation\nof such a concept has considerable\noperational\npenalties;\nhowever, the\nturbulence\nproduced by equipment on airplanes,\nsuch as landing\ngear,\nengines,\nand engine pods, can be used to provide reduction\nin trailed\nvortex strength.\nDetails\nconcerning\nthe development and tests of the\nturbulence\ndevice are given in references\n4 to 6.\nVortex\n\n'\n\nInteraction\n\nVortex interaction\nand control is a term used to describe\nthe turbulence\nand shear stress produced during coalescence\nof several\nvortices\ninto\na single vortex.\nSome of the work described\nin reference\n7 has shown that\ntwo vortices\nof the same sense considerably\nstrain\nand distort\neach other\nduring the merging process.\nThe production\nof turbulence\nduring the\nmerging process is discussed\nin more detail\nin the analytical\nstudies\nin\nreferences\n8 and 9. The vortex wake behind a large jet transport\nis\ndominated by several\nvortices\ncoming from the wingtip,\nflap end, wing-body\njunction,\nand other places where large changes in spanwise load distribution\noccur.\nDownstream, the vortices\nfrom one-half\nthe airplane\ncoalesce\ninto\na single vortex leaving\nbehind the classical\nvortex pattern\nof a pair of\naircraft\ntrailing\nvortices.\nNumerous methods have been attempted\nto control\nthe early wake development,\ntwo of which are described\nin this section.\nThe simple inviscid\nanalytical\ntechniques\ndiscussed\nin reference\n10\nindicated\nthat the vortex wake development of a wide-body transport\naircraft\ncould be considerably\naltered\nby introducing\nan additional\nvortex pair\ninto the wake.\nModel tests of such a method were conducted and described\nin reference\n11. To produce an additional\nvortex pair in the wake of a\nwide-body jet model, fins were placed on the upper surface of the wing\nas shown in figure\n5. The fins were canted with respect to the local\nfree-stream\nso as to produce a vortex of the same sense as the wingtip\nvortex.\nThe spanwise postion\nof the fin on a 747 model airplane\nwas varied\nduring tests\nin the 40- by 80-foot\nwind tunnel.\nThe effect\nof the fin\nvortex on the model wake was measured 15 spans behind the 747 model using\na Learjet\nsize wing for rolling-moment\nmeasurement.\nThe results\nof these\ntests are shown in figure\n6.\nFor these tests,\nthe ratio\nof the fin height\nto wing span of the 747 model was about Cl.08 and the fin cord was about 0.04\nof the span.\nAs indicated\nin figure\n6, the vortex-induced\nrolling\nmoment\nwas reduced by about a factor\nof 4 with the fin at about the 50-percentsemispan position.\nThe effect\nof fin spanwise location\non the vortexinduced rolling\nmoment is significant.\nThe work on the fin concept is\nrelatively\nnew and, at this time, little\nhas been done to address the\noperational\nproblems that may be incurred\nwith the implementation\nof this\nmethod.\n\n759\n\nAnother method of controlling\nvortex\ninteraction\nis to vary the spanwise\nposition\nof the flap vortex and relative\nstrengths\nof the flap and wingtip\nvortices.\nThis is done by altering\nthe spanwise load distribution.\nAnalytical\nstudies\nof such a method are discussed\nin reference\n8. The\nresults\nof reference\n8 indicated\nthat,\nif the wingtip\nand flap vortices\nwere of nearly equal strength\nand the flap vortex was located\nat about\nthe 40-percent-semispan\nposition,\nthe effect\nof vortex interaction\nwas\nmaximized.\nNumerous model tests and flight\ntests were conducted employing\nspan load alteration\nfor vortex interaction.\nA 747 airplane\nwas used in\nwhich only the inboard flap section\nwas deployed for the landing approach.\nDetails\nconcerning\nthe model tests of this method are described\nin\nreference\n7.\nFlight-test\nresults\nof this configuration\nare indicated\nin\nfigure\n7 and 8.\nIn figure\n7, the vortex pattern\nbehind a 747 airplane\nin the normal\nlanding approach flap configuration\nis made visible\nby smoke devices\nmounted under the wing.\nThe wake is seen to develop quickly\ninto a pair\nof trailing\nvortices.\nFlights\nwith the 747 were conducted at a lift\ncoefficient\nof 1.2.\nVortex penetrations\nwere conducted with Learjet\nand T-37 airplanes.\nDuring these tests,\nroll\nupsets greater\nthan the\ncontrol\ncapability\nof the Learjet\nand T-37 airplanes\nwere experienced\nat\ndistances\nof from 6 to 8 n. mi. behind the 747 airplane\n(reference\n12).\nFigure 8 illustrates\nthe vortex pattern\nbehind the 747 airplane\nat a lift\ncoefficient\nof 1.2 with only the inboard flap segment deployed.\nThis\nconfiguration\nis seen to inhibit\nthe merging of the wingtip\nand flap\nvortex into single\nvortex.\nThe enhanced vortex\ninteraction\nproduces a\nsignificantly\ndiffuse\nvortex wake.\nModel tests\n(reference\n7) indicated\nthat this configuration\nwould reduce the vortex-induced\nrolling\nmoment\nabout 50 percent.\nFlight\ntests indicated\nthat the T-37 airplane\ncould\napproach as close as 3 n. mi. behind the 747 airplane\nbefore experiencing\nlarge roll\nupsets.\nThis wake vortex minimization\nmethod has considerable\nperformance\npenalties\nwhich prohibit\nits operational\nuse; however, the\nmethod does illustrate\nthe importance\nof vortex\ninteraction\nfor future\naircraft\ndesign consideration.\nFlight\n\nSpoilers\n\nA concept was developed which employs both the principle\nof turbulence\ninjection\nand vortex\ninteraction\nthrough span load alteration.\nThe method\nconsists\nof deploying\nselected\nflight\nspoilers\non the airplane.\nConsiderable details\nconcerning\nthe development and implementation\nof this concept\nare described\nin references\n13 to 17.\nEvaluation\nof the flight\nspoilers\nhave been conducted on DC-lo, L-1011, and 747 airplane\nmodels.\nFlight\ntests have also been conducted using the spoiler\nconcept on\n747 and L-1011 airplanes.\nFlight\ntests and model tests with the 747\nairplane\nhave shown that the use of the two outboard spoiler\nsections\ncan\nreduce the vortex-induced\nrolling\nmoment on a Learjet\nsize airplane\nby\nabout 50 percent.\n760\n\nPhotographs of flight\ntests using the spoiler\nconcept on a L-1011 airplane\nare shown in figures\n9 and 10. The vortex pattern\nfor the normal landing\napproach configuration\nof the L-1011 is shown in figure\n9. Tests indicated\nthat for a T-37 airplane,\nroll\nupsets exceeding the roll\ncontrol\npower of the\nT-37 were experienced\nat about 6 n. mi.\nThe use of the three outboard spoiler\nsections\non the L-1011 airplane\nfor vortex minimization\nand their\neffect\non the vortex pattern\nis seen in figure\n10. Comparison of smoke-marked\nvortex wake with and without\nthe spoilers\ndeployed (figs.\n9 and 10)\nindicates\nthat the vortex wake is quickly\ndiffused.\nThe spoiler\nboth sheds\nturbulence\ninto the wake and alters\nthe span load distribution.\nThe\nrelative\nimportance\nof turbulence\nand span load alteration\non the spoilers\nability\nto diffuse\nthe vortex\nis unknown.\nTests showed that a T-37\nairplane\ncould approach as close as 2 n. mi. without\nan uncontrollable\nupset.\nDetails\nconcerning\nthe performance\ndecrement caused by the use of the\nspoilers\nare covered\nin references\n13 to 17. The spoilers\ndo\nappear to offer\nseveral\nadvantages for vortex minimization\nuse on existing\nairplanes,\nsince they are effective\nand available\nfor use.\nCertain\noperational\nproblems,\nsuch as possible\nbuffet\nand associated\nstructural\nproblems,\napproach speed increases,\nand climb requirements,\nare still\nunanswered.\nBy comparison with the other methods discussed\nfor vortex\nminimization,\nthe spoilers\noffer\nthe greatest\nchance for operational\nuse\non existinq\naircraft.\nThe other vortex minimization\ntechniaues\ndescribed\ncan only be implemented in future aircraft\ndesign.\n\nANALYTICALSTUDIES\nUnder an NASA contract,\na computer code was developed to solve the vortex\nequations\nof fluid\nmotion including\nconvection\nand turbulent\ndiffusion.\nThe objective\nof the theoretical\nwork is to describe\nin detail\nthe\nvortex wake for a given aircraft\nconfiguration.\nThe computer code is\ncapable of calculating\nthe wake history\nincluding\nthe effect\nof atmospheric\nconditions\nsuch as winds, wind shear, atmospheric\nturbulence,\natmospheric\nstability,\nand the influence\nof the ground plane.\nThe computer code is\na two-dimensional,\ntime marching,\nfinite\ndifference\napproximation\nto the\nReynold's\nstress equation.\nDetails\nconcerning\nthe computer code are\nreported\nin references\n8 and 9. All of the vortex minimization\nmethods\ndescribed\nin the previous\nexperimental\nsections\nha-ve been investigated\nusing the computer code.\nThe analytical\nresults\ngenerally\nagree with the\nexperimental\nresults.\nShown in figure\n11 are the calculated\nresults\nof a pair of vortices\ndescending\ninto a wind shear.\nThese results\nof the computer code are\ntaken from reference\n18.
