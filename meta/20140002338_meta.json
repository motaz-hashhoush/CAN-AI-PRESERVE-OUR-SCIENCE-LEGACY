The purpose of a model developer is to develop and unit test model component libraries (fluid, electrical, gas, etc.). The models are designed to simulate software for GSE (Ground Special Power, Crew Access Arm, Cryo, Fire and Leak Detection System, Environmental Control System (ECS), etc. ~.) before they are implemented into hardware. These models support verifying local control and remote software for End-Item Software Under Test (SUT). The model simulates the physical behavior (function, state, limits and 110) of each end-item and it's dependencies as defined in the Subsystem Interface Table, Software Requirements & Design Specification (SRDS), Ground Integrated Schematic (GIS), and System Mechanical Schematic.(SMS). The software of each specific model component is simulated through MATLAB's Simulink program. The intensiv~ model development life cycle is a.s follows: Identify source documents; identify model scope; update schedule; preliminary design review; develop model requirements; update model.. scope; update schedule; detailed design review; create/modify library component; implement library components reference; implement subsystem components; develop a test script; run the test script; develop users guide; send model out for peer review; the model is sent out for verific~tionlvalidation; if there is empirical data, a validation data package is generated; if there is not empirical data, a verification package is generated; the test results are then reviewed; and finally, the user. requests accreditation, and a statement of accreditation is prepared. Once each component model is reviewed and approved, they are intertwined together into one integrated model. This integrated model is then tested itself, through a test script and autotest, so that it can be concluded that all models work conjointly, for a single purpose. The component I was assigned, specifically, was a fluid component, a discrete pressure switch. The switch takes a fluid pressure input, and if the pressure is greater than a designated cutoff pressure, the switch would stop fluid flow.", "title": "Develop a Model Component", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2014-03-26T08:03:57.3600000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20140002338, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Ensey, Tyler S."}, "organization": {"name": "University of Central Florida", "location": "Orlando, FL, United States"}}, "id": "02f725ff2ea045e2818681ca5f94b4af"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "id": 20140002338, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20140002338, "id": "c327fc3208e34ce187192f459bdb8f71", "publicationDate": "2013-07-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20140002338.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20140002338/downloads/20140002338.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20140002338/downloads/20140002338.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20140002338/downloads/20140002338.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
