Attention is given to data which quantify the effects of display delays in the range of 0-100 msec on system stability and performance, and pilot dynamic response for a particular choice of aircraft dynamics, display, controller, and task. The conventional control system design methods are reviewed, the pilot response data presented, and data for long delays, all suggest lead filter compensation of display delay. Pilot-aircraft system crossover frequency information guides compensation filter specification.", "title": "Time delays in flight simulator visual displays", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PROCEEDINGS", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-11T05:24:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19810063965, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Crane, D.
