When C is sufficiently charged, current\nthrough the SCR drops below its required holding\n\ncurrent level, the SCR turns off and C begins discharging through R into the base of Qi. In the meantime, Qi, having been turned on, has pulled in the\nrelay that provides the output connection. As C discharges, current in the collector of Qi and in the relay\nstarts to decrease until it drops below the relay latching level, at which the relay opens breaking the output\nconnection. The circuit may be retriggered at any\ntime after SCR shutoff, provided the trigger amplitude\nis sufficiently greater than the charge on C at that\ntime.\nNotes:\n1. For a given C, the range of times that are available\nis limited at the low end by that value of R which\ncauses the Q 1 base current to exceed the holding\ncurrent rating of the SCR; and at the high end by\nthat value of R which will not pass sufficient transistor current to pull in the relay.\n(continued overleaf)\n\nThis document was prepared under the sponsorship of the National\nAeronautics and Space Administration.

Timed output pulses of up to a minute or so are \t\nobtainable with the circuit as shown. Longer pulses \t\nare obtainable by substituting a field effect transis- \t\ntOrTforQi or by replacing the relay -.with a Schmitt\t\ntrigger-so : that lower base current in Qi may be\t\nused.\t\n3.
