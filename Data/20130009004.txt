b'Concentrators Enhance Solar Power Systems\nNASA Technology\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cR\n\night now, solar electric propulsion is being\nlooked at very seriously,\xe2\x80\x9d says Michael\nPiszczor, chief of the photovoltaic and\npower technologies branch at Glen Research Center. The\nreason, he explains, originates with a unique NASA mission from the late 1990s.\n\nDeep Space 1 was a spacecraft designed to test a dozen\ndifferent space technologies, including a solar array that focused\nsunlight on a smaller solar cell to generate electric power.\n\n108\t Energy and Environment\t\n\nIn 1998, the Deep Space 1 spacecraft launched\nfrom Kennedy Space Center to test a dozen different\nspace technologies\xe2\x80\x94including SCARLET, or the Solar\nConcentrator Array with Refractive Linear Element\nTechnology. As a solar array that focused sunlight on a\nsmaller solar cell to generate electric power, SCARLET\nnot only powered Deep Space 1\xe2\x80\x99s instruments but also\npowered its ion engine, which propelled the spacecraft\nthroughout its journey.\nDeep Space 1 was the first spacecraft powered by\na refractive concentrator design like SCARLET, and\nalso utilized multi-junction solar cells, or cells made of\nmultiple layers of different materials. For the duration\nof its 38-month mission, SCARLET performed flawlessly, even as Deep Space 1 flew by Comet Borrelly and\nAsteroid Braille.\n\xe2\x80\x9cEveryone remembers the ion engine on Deep Space 1,\nbut they tend to forget that the SCARLET array powered\nit,\xe2\x80\x9d says Piszczor. \xe2\x80\x9cNot only did both technologies work\nas designed, but the synergy between the two, solar power\nand propulsion together, is really the important aspect of\nthis technology demonstration mission. It was the first\nsuccessful use of solar electric propulsion for primary\npropulsion.\xe2\x80\x9d\nMore than a decade later, NASA is keenly interested\nin using solar electric propulsion (SEP) for future space\nmissions. A key issue is cost, and SEP has the potential\nto substantially reduce cost compared to conventional\nchemical propulsion technology.\n\xe2\x80\x9cSEP allows you to use spacecraft that are smaller,\nlighter, and less costly,\xe2\x80\x9d says Piszczor. \xe2\x80\x9cEven though it\nmight take longer to get somewhere using SEP, if you are\nwilling to trade time for cost and smaller vehicles, it\xe2\x80\x99s a\ngood trade.\xe2\x80\x9d\nPotentially, SEP could be used on future science missions in orbit around the Earth or Moon, to planets or\nasteroids, on deep space science missions, and even on\nexploration missions. In fact, electric propulsion is already\nbeing used on Earth-orbiting satellites for positioning.\n\nTechnology Transfer\nDeveloped through a partnership between NASA\xe2\x80\x99s\nGlenn Research Center and Fort Worth, Texas-based\nENTECH Inc. (now Entech Solar), SCARLET originated from Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)\ncontracts that started in 1985. The partners\xe2\x80\x99 purpose was\nto adapt Entech\xe2\x80\x99s existing terrestrial solar concentrator\ntechnology, already demonstrated on Earth, for space\napplications. The Ballistic Missile Defense Organization\nwas also a supporter and contributor to the work.\n\xe2\x80\x9cAt that time, concentrators were being looked at\nfor space, but most were reflective systems that used\nmirrors to reflect light and focus it on a small point,\xe2\x80\x9d\nsays Piszczor. \xe2\x80\x9cEntech\xe2\x80\x99s design uses a unique refractive concept.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe concentrating lens of Entech\xe2\x80\x99s design had a\ncurved outer surface with Fresnel patterns, or grooves,\non the inside. It makes the most use of available sunlight\nand focuses the light onto multi-junction solar cells.\nAccording to Piszczor, a main advantage of Entech\xe2\x80\x99s\ntechnology is its optical performance and shape error tolerance. This translates to a concentrator design that has\nhigh optical efficiency, can be readily manufactured, and\nis less sensitive to thermal and structural distortions.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe overall design hits a sweet spot,\xe2\x80\x9d says Piszczor.\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s both high performance and easily manufactured.\xe2\x80\x9d\nAfter SCARLET, Entech and NASA continued\nto work through the SBIR program, along with the\nDepartment of Defense, to develop a lightweight version\nof the same technology called the Stretched Lens Array\n(SLA). The SLA replaces the top glass surface used in the\nSCARLET lens design with a stretched thin film lens to\nconcentrate sunlight onto photovoltaic cells below the\nlens. Compared to the SCARLET design, the SLA technology minimized mass and cost even further.\nEntech\xe2\x80\x99s CEO, David Gelbaum, says multi-junction\ncells are extremely efficient under Entech\xe2\x80\x99s color-mixing,\narched Fresnel lenses, thanks to how they concentrate\nSpinoff 2012\n\nmore light on the cells and how they distribute the fullspectrum of sunlight onto the cells. The bigger advantages\nof the technology, however, are the cost, weight, and\nrobustness. \xe2\x80\x9cBy using only one-eighth as much solar cell\narea per Watt of array power, we save cost and weight and\nmake it possible to better insulate and shield the smaller\nsolar cells,\xe2\x80\x9d he says.\nEntech has now taken its knowledge from working\nwith Glenn over the last 25 years and incorporated it into\na new ultra-light solar concentrator for terrestrial applications. In 2012, the technology won an R&D 100 Award,\nrecognizing it as one of the top 100 technologically significant new products of 2012 by R&D Magazine.\n\nBenefits\nEntech\xe2\x80\x99s new product, SolarVolt, is a concentrating\nphotovoltaic solar module that incorporates a significant\namount of technology from the SLA. \xe2\x80\x9cWhile the SLA\nwas primarily optimized to save mass because launching\ninto space is so expensive, SolarVolt is optimized to save\ncost because the terrestrial market is so cost-competitive,\xe2\x80\x9d\nsays Gelbaum.\nFor space, the company uses multi-junction solar cells\nwith lenses made of space-qualified silicone rubber. For\nterrestrial applications, Entech uses low-cost silicon cells\nunder acrylic plastic lenses. Because the space version does\nnot need to resist wind and hail, there is no lens cover;\nSolarVolt uses a tempered glass window to protect the\nlenses and cells.\nOn Earth, SolarVolt can be used to generate\nelectricity for applications from a fraction of a megawatt\nto multimegawatt systems. Commercial applications\ninclude utility-scale power plants, distributed energy\nfor smart grid systems, communications systems,\nindustrial building power systems, and government and\nmilitary power systems.\nThe technology is most productive in areas with\nhigh, continuous direct normal irradiation, or DNI,\nwhich comes directly from the sun. High DNI areas in\nSpinoff 2012 \t\n\nthe United States include southern\nCalifornia, Arizona, Nevada, New\nMexico, west Texas, and Colorado. As\nGelbaum describes, \xe2\x80\x9cSolarVolt is primarily aimed at large utility-scale solar\npower plant applications in the sunny\ndesert regions.\xe2\x80\x9d\nIn 2011, SolarVolt received\ninternational certification\ndesignating it has met concentrating PV module testing\nand construction evaluation\nrequirements to verify its\nperformance and reliability in hail, extreme\ntemperatures, and wet\nand dry conditions.\nEven as the SLA\nspins off for terrestrial\nuse, NASA continues\nto improve it for use in space. Glenn is now partnering\nwith Deployable Space Systems, Inc. to fuse Entech\xe2\x80\x99s SLA\nconcentrator with a lightweight, deployable structural\nplatform called SOLAROSA, or the Stretched Optical\nLens Architecture on Roll-Out Solar Array. Ad Astra\nRocket Co. is interested in using SOLAROSA to support\n\nEntech\xe2\x80\x99s SolarVolt\nproduct, incorporating\nNASA technology, can be used to\ngenerate electricity for utility-scale power plants,\ncommunication systems, and government and military\npower systems. It is most productive in sunny desert\nregions like Nevada.\n\nits Variable Specific Impulse Magnetoplasma Rocket\nengine, an advanced plasma propulsion system.\nThanks to such public-private partnerships,\nthe future is bright where solar electric power\nis concerned\xe2\x80\x94both on the ground and in space.\n\xe2\x80\x9cCollaborating with NASA has not only helped us to\nimprove and refine our space and ground solar power\ntechnologies, but has helped Entech gain credibility for\nits technology,\xe2\x80\x9d says Gelbaum. \xe2\x80\x9cNASA is a terrific partner\nfor small businesses like us.\xe2\x80\x9d v\nSolarVolt\xe2\x84\xa2 is a trademark of Entech Solar.\n\nEnergy and Environment \t 109\n\n'
