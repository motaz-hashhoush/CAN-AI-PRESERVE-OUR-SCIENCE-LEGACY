objectives\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Focus on identification of actionable security events from\nthe big mountain of data that flows into and out of a Data\nComputation Center\n\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration\n\nApril 21, 2015\n\nNASA Advanced Supercomputing Division\n\n2\n\nThe Big Data Problem in Cyber Security\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Internet-accessible Data Computation Centers are under\nconstant attack, which come from the Internet\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Attacks are intermixed with a large volume of legitimate\nInternet traffic flowing into and out of the Data Computation\nCenter, which leads to a big mountain of data\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Cyber security tools are used to monitor for attacks, but\nthese generate a big mountain of data that is added to the\nmountain of legitimate data traffic\n\xe2\x80\xa2 To keep from being overwhelmed, security analysts are\ninterested in knowing about only those attacks for which\nmanual or automated action is required to counter them\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The problem addressed by this presentation is how to\nextract actionable security data out of this big data\nmountain\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration\n\nApril 21, 2015\n\nNASA Advanced Supercomputing Division\n\n3\n\nThe NASA Big Data Supercomputer Cyber\nSecurity Environment\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The Data Computation Center is accessible over the\nInternet\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Legitimate users must be identified and authenticated\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Users can download their own programs and any additional\ndata that is needed\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Security should not be so onerous that it impedes the use of\nthe system\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Actionable security events that could lead to a misuse of the\nsystem should be identified and acted upon\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Need to discover actionable events from the big mountain of\ndata in which they are embedded\n\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration\n\nApril 21, 2015\n\nNASA Advanced Supercomputing Division\n\n4\n\nGeneral Cyber Security Objectives\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Identify and authenticate legitimate users prior to granting\nthem access to the Data Computation Center\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Ensure that users access only data to which they are\nauthorized\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Identify attacks and block them while minimizing\n- False positives \xe2\x80\x93 so that legitimate users are not blocked\n- False negatives \xe2\x80\x93 so that dangerous attacks are not missed\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Ensure that malicious code and backdoors\n- Are not planted in system or\n- Are detected if they are\n\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration\n\nApril 21, 2015\n\nNASA Advanced Supercomputing Division\n\n5\n\nTwo Broad Strategies for Detecting Attacks\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Direct detection approaches applied directly to the Data\nComputation Center data flowing to and from the network\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Detection approaches applied only after reducing the big\nmountain of Data Computation Center data flowing to and\nfrom the network to a more manageable level\n\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration\n\nApril 21, 2015\n\nNASA Advanced Supercomputing Division\n\n6\n\nDirect Detection Can Be Used To Detect Malicious\nDelivery Sites\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Phishing and malware delivery sites can hide behind\nconstantly changing addresses\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Detection approaches are compute intensive for the big\nmountain of DNS data flowing to and from the network\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Changing IP addresses over a short time period is called\nFast-Flux\n-\n\nDetection based on counting number of IP addresses associated with\ndomain and time-to-live assessment\nImportant to add other parameters when making a decision as to\nwhether this is malware, since content delivery networks use this for\nload balancing\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Randomly generated domain names at regular intervals in\nlarge numbers is called Domain Flux\n-\n\nDetection based on number of domain name failures returned by the\nhost making DNS request\n\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration\n\nApril 21, 2015\n\nNASA Advanced Supercomputing Division\n\n7\n\nDirect Detection Can Be Used To Detect Malicious\nDelivery Sites\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Domain Generation Algorithms (DGAs) can automatically\ngenerate domain names\n-\n\nGenerated names tend to be gibberish\nGeneration of names is deterministic that so that Command and\nControl site and embedded malware can communicate after change\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Use Machine Learning to Detect Domain Generation\nAlgorithm Attacks\n\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration\n\nApril 21, 2015\n\nNASA Advanced Supercomputing Division\n\n8\n\nUse Machine Learning to Detect Domain\nGeneration Algorithm Attacks\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Use a combined 2-gram to 3-gram Markov chain to detect\ndeviation from \xe2\x80\x9cnormal\xe2\x80\x9d domain names\n\xe2\x80\xa2 While this may not detect newer DGA-generated domains\nname such as those that pair real words in a noun-verbnoun-verb combination, it is still very useful\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Combining with other techniques will reduce false-positives\nand false-negatives\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Combining a 2-gram Markov chain (which is less strict on\ndetecting gibberish) with an organization check and fast-flux\ndomain flux detection may help detect the noun-verb-nounverb DGA domains.\n\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration\n\nApril 21, 2015\n\nNASA Advanced Supercomputing Division\n\n9\n\nDetection After Reducing the Big Data\nMountain to a More Manageable Volume\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Network flow data is the largest component of the big data\nmountain\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Want to categorize network flows into three risk categories:\n-\n\nAcceptable Risk: Flows that are unlikely to contain any security\nattacks \xe2\x80\x93 and thus can be discarded from further analysis\nHigh Risk: Flows that are likely to contain security attacks \xe2\x80\x93 and thus\nmust be extensively analyzed\nUnknown Risk: Flows for which it is unknown whether or not they\ncontain a security attack \xe2\x80\x93 which also must be analyzed\n\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration\n\nApril 21, 2015\n\nNASA Advanced Supercomputing Division\n\n10\n\nCategorization of Flows Based on the Source\nof the Flow\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Acceptable Risk flows:\n-\n\nFlows that come from IP addresses that fall under an organization\nfrom which an authorized user has logged on to a Data Computation\nCenter system\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 High Risk risk flows:\n-\n\nFlows that come from IP addresses and associated organizations\nthat are on watch lists, have mounted an attack, or have scanned\ndark space\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Unknown Risk flows:\n-\n\nFlows that cannot initially be placed into the acceptable or high risk\ncategories\n\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration\n\nApril 21, 2015\n\nNASA Advanced Supercomputing Division\n\n11\n\nDetection of Malicious Command & Control\nChannels Using High Risk & Unknown Risk Flows\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Detect Command and Control activity for any malicious\ncode that may have been installed in a system\n-\n\nNetwork beaconing activity could indicate presence of\n\xe2\x80\x93 Botnet slave checking in for assignments\n\xe2\x80\x93 Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) checking in for assignments or\ndelivering intellectual property\n\n-\n\n-\n\nDetection by looking for a recurring flows that provides a pattern of\ncommunications\nNeed big data trending with flows remaining from data mountain\nreduction\n\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration\n\nApril 21, 2015\n\nNASA Advanced Supercomputing Division\n\n12\n\nDetect Attempted or Actual Intrusions by Looking\nat High Risk and Unknown Risk Reduced Flows\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Normally a large number of Intrusion Detection System\n(IDS) events for a large data center with heterogeneous\nsystems\n-\n\nBig data mountain reduction eliminates all but High and Unknown risk\nflows, helping to focus on events of most concern\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Still need significant computation to de-clutter the IDS\nresults to identify only actionable data\n\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration\n\nApril 21, 2015\n\nNASA Advanced Supercomputing Division\n\n13\n\nCorrelation Provides a Useful Method to\nEliminate False Positives\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Correlate IDS events with the flow that caused the IDS to\ntrigger\n-\n\nThe flows that correlate with an IDS event are the flows on which to\nfocus attention\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Correlate IDS-flows with vulnerabilities from vulnerability\nscanner\n-\n\nThe flows where the IDS correlates with a vulnerability are the events\non which to focus\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Correlation reduces false positives, but is computationally\nintensive\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Use pattern discovery to detect distributed, targeted attacks\nthat may involve recurring flows from multiple sources\n\nNational Aeronautics and Space

or userlevel compromise.\n-\n\nUnusual login time for a particular user\nNew source host or organization\nMultiple logins for same user from different locations within a small\ntime window\n\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration\n\nApril 21, 2015\n\nNASA Advanced Supercomputing Division\n\n15\n\nIdentify Indicators of Possible Data\nExfiltration\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Unusual outbound activity may indicate unauthorized data\nexfiltration\n-\n\nUnauthorized access or attempting to access unauthorized hosts\nUnauthorized privilege escalation or attempting privilege escalation\nUnusual file transfer protocol\nFile transfer to host or organization not seen before or to an IP\naddress on a watch list\nFile transfer to unauthorized foreign county\nUnusual emails such as emails with extremely large attachments and\nemail bursts to free email providers\n\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration\n\nApril 21, 2015\n\nNASA Advanced Supercomputing Division\n\n16\n\nVisualization Is Important to Cyber Security\nSince a Picture is Worth 1000 Words\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Visualization allows the security analyst to see events and\nrelationships that may be lost in rows of data as well as\nsummarize security event activity\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Provide visualization of the various flows that are of most\nconcern to help identify patterns not before seen\n\nNational Aeronautics and Space
