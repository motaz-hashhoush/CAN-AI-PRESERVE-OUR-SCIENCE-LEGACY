How well these objectives are met,\nand at what cost, depends on a variety of factors, but largely on the ability of\naerospace engineers and scientists to acquire and process the results of NASA/DoD\nfunded R&D.\nThe ability of U.S. aerospace engineers and scientists to identify, acquire, and\nuse scientific and technical information (STI) is of paramount importance to the\nefficiency of the R&D process. Testimony to the central role of ST1 in the R&D\nprocess is found in numerous studies (Fischer, 1980). These studies show, among\nother things, that U.S. aerospace engineers and scientists devote more time, on the\naverage, to the communication of technical information than to any other scientific or\ntechnical activity (Pinelli, et al., 1989). We concur, therefore, with Fischer\'s (1980)\nconclusion that the "role of scientific and technical communication is thus central to\nthe success of the innovation process, in general, and the management of R&D\nactivities, in particular."\nThe NASAIDoD Aerospace Knowledge Diffusion Research Project was\ndeveloped because, in terms of empirically derived data, very little is known about\nthe diffusion of knowledge in the aerospace industry both in terms of the channels\nused to communicate the ideas and the information-gathering habits and practices of\nthe members of the social system (i.e., aerospace engineers and scientists). Even less\nis known about the system through which the results of federally-funded aerospace\nR&D is diffused throughout the aerospace community. Understanding how ST1 is\ncommunicated through certain channels over time among members of the social system\nwould contribute to increasing productivity, stimulating innovation, and improving and\nmaintaining the professional competence of U.S. aerospace engineers and scientists.\n\n"Aerospace" includes aeronautics, space science, space technology, and related\nfields.\n\nPROJECT OVERVIEW\nThe NASAIDoD Aerospace Knowledge Diffusion Research Project is a\ncooperative effort that is sponsored by NASA, Codes RF and NTI: and the DoD,\nOfc of the Assistant Secretary of the Air F m ,Deputy for Scientific and Technical\nfie\nInformation. The research project is a joint effort of the Indiana University Center for\nS w e y Research and the NASA Langley Research Center.\nThe project will provide descriptive and analytical data regarding the flow of\nST1 at the individual, organizational, national, and international levels. It will examine\nboth the channels used to communicate information and the social system of the\naerospace knowledge diffusion process. The results of the project should provide useful\ninformation to R&D managers, information managers, and others concerned with\nimproving access to and use of STI.\nSeveral major barriers to effective knowledge diffusion exist in the U.S. First,\nthe very low level of monetary support for knowledge transfer compared with\nknowledge production suggests that dissemination efforts are not viewed as an\nimportant component of the R&D process. Second, there are mounting reports fiom\nusers about difficulties in getting appropriate information useful for problem solving\nand decision making. Third, rapid advances in many m a s of ST1 knowledge can be\nfully exploited only if they are quickly translated into further research and application.\nFourth, current mechanisms are often inadequate to help the user assess the quality of\navailable information. Fifth, the characteristics of actual usage behavior are not\nconsidered in making available useful and easily retrieved information.\nThese deficiencies must be remedied if the results of federally funded R&D\nare to be successfully applied to innovation, problem solving, and productivity. Only\nby maximizing the R&D process can the U.S.maintain its international competitive\nedge in aerospace.\nProject Assumptions\n\n1.\n\nRapid diffusion of technology and technological developments requires an\nunderstanding of the aerospace knowledge diffusion process.\n\n2.\n\nKnowledge production, transfer, and utilization are equally important components\nof the aerospace knowledge diffusion process.\n\n3.\n\nUnderstanding the channels; the information products involved in the production,\ntransfer, and utilization of aerospace information; and the information-seeking\nhabits, practices, and preferences of aerospace engineers and scientists is\nnecessary to understand aerospace knowledge diffusion.\n\n4.\n\nThe knowledge &rived fiom federally funded aerospace R&D is indispensable\nin maintaining the vitality and international competitiveness of the U.S.\n\naerospace industry and essential in maintaining and improving the professional\n..\ncompetency of U S aerospace engineers and scientists.\n5.\n\nThe U S government technical report plays an important, but as yet undefined,\n..\nrole in the transfer and utilization of knowledge derived from federally funded\naerospace R&D.\n\n6.\n\nLibrarians, as information intermediaries, play an important, but as yet\nundefined, role in the transfer and utilization of knowledge derived from\nfederally funded aerospace R&D.\n\nProject Objectives\n1\n.\n\nUnderstanding the aerospace knowledge diffusion process at the individual,\norganizational, and national levels, placing particular emphasis on the diffusion\nof federally funded aerospace STI.\n\n2.\n\nUnderstanding the international aerospace knowledge diffusion process at the\nindividual and organizational levels, placing particular emphasis on the systems\nused to diffuse the results of federally funded aerospace STI.\n\n3.\n\nUnderstanding the roles NASA/DoD technical reports and aerospace librarians\nplay in the transfer and utilization of knowledge derived from federally funded\naerospace R&D.\n\n4.\n\nAchieving recognition and acceptance within NASA, DoD and throughout the\naerospace community that STI is a valuable strategic resource for innovation,\nproblem solving, and productivity.\n\n5.\n\nProviding results that can be used to optimize the effectiveness and efficiency\nof the Federal STI aerospace transfer system and exchange mechanism.\n\nProject Design\nThe initial thrust of the aerospace knowledge diffusion research project is largely\nexploratory and descriptive; it focuses on the information channels and the members\nof the social system associated with the Federal aerospace knowledge diffusion process.\nIt provides a pragmatic basis for understanding how the results of NASA/DoD research\ndiffuse into the aerospace R&D process. Over the long term, the project will provide\nan empirical basis for understanding the aerospace knowledge diffusion process at the\nindividual, organizational, national, and international levels. An outline of the\ndescriptive portion of the project is contained in Table 1 as "A Five Year Program of\nResearch on Aerospace Knowledge Diffusion."\n\nTable 1.

The\nconceptual model shown in figure 1 assumes a consistent internal logic that governs\nthe information-seeking and processing behavior of aerospace engineers and scientists\ndespite any individual differences they may exhibit.\nThe results of the Phase 1Pilot Study indicate that U.S. aerospace engineers\nand scientists spend approximately 65 percent of a 40-hour work week communicating\nSTI. The types of information and the infonnation products used and produced in\nperforming professional duties are similar, with basic STI and in-house technical data\nmost frequently reported. Internal STI to the organization, which includes NASA/DoD\ntechnical reports, journal articles, and conference1 m e i g papers is preferred over\netn\nexternal STI. Respondents identified informal channels and personalized sources as\nthe primary methods of seeking STI, followed by the use of formal information sources\nwhen solving technical problems. Only after completing an informal search, followed\nby using formal information sources, do they turn to librarians and technical\ninformation specialists for assistance.\n\n~ l l t t not\ns\n\nw-m\n\npurpose of\n\n.\n\nmatlon\n\nnooded: redellno\n\nEz?E&\n\nYmm of\naperlence\n\nPLwpoaoof\nlnkrmatkn -I\nI n f o r m r n n rwrce --) rwrce\nused\n\n+\n\n+Ewlua(kn+\n\ndircipllne\n\npurpose Of\n\n+\n\nInkrmatlon\n\norpMTodmlcal\n\n. w\n\nRssults\n\nroeded;mrtlnw\nRa6ubnol\nappUcaMoD\n\nType6(r) 6 #nd(s) of\n\nlnformatkn used\n\nEzz2\n\nAaoscrlMlKy\n\nneeded; ceese\nResults not\nappliceMeto\nPurpose of\ninformation\nneeded;redeRno\ns I selection;\nM\nm\nreenter\n\nFMlllMY\nEase of use\nTechnM quality\n\nComprehensiveness\n\nFigure 1. A Conceptual Model for the Use, Transfer, and Production of ST1 by\nU.S. Aerospace Engineers and Scientists\n\nPhase 2 focuses on aerospace knowledge transfer and use within the larger\nsocial system, placing particular emphasis on the flow of aerospace ST1 in government and industry and the role of the information intermediary (i.e., the aerospace\nlibrariadtechnical information specialist) in knowledge transfer. In Phase 2, the process\nof innovation in the U.S. aerospace industry is conceptualized as an infor- mation\nprocessing system which must deal with work-related uncertainty through patterns of\ntechnical communications. Information processing in aerospace R&D (figure 2) is\nviewed as an ongoing problem solving cycle involving each activity within the\ninnovation process, the larger organization, and the external world.\n\nFigure 2. The Aerospace R&D Process as an Information Processing System.\n5\n\nPhase 3 focuses on knowledge use and transfer at the individual and organizational levels in the academic sector of the aerospace community. Faced with\nshrinking enrollments, particularly a the graduate level, university aerospace programs\nt\nmust find ways to maintain the talent pool that will advance aerospace technological\n..\ndevelopment and guarantee U S competitiveness.\n\nPhase 4 examines knowledge production, use, and transfer among non-U.S.\nindividuals and aerospace organizations, specifically in Western Europe and Japan.\nAs U.S. collaboration with foreign aerospace technology producers increases, a more\ninternational manufacturing environment will arise, fostering an increased flow of U.S.\ntrade. To cooperate in joint ventures as well as to compete successfully at the\ninternational level, U S aerospace industries wl need to develop methods to collect,\n..\nil\ntranslate, analyze, and disseminate the best of foreign aerospace STI.\n\nOVERVIEW OF THE FEDERAL AEROSPACE\nKNOWLEDGE DIFFUSION PROCESS\nA model (figure 3) that depicts the transfer of federally funded aerospace R&D\nfrom "producer to user" is composed of two parts -- the informal that relies on\ncollegial contacts and the formal that relies on surrogates, information products, and\ninformation intermediaries to complete the transfer process.\nInformal (Colleaial)\n\nJ.\nlDOD\n\nlDTlC\n\nle, A.,l\n\nNTIS FILE\n\nInformation\nIntermediaries\n\nProducers\n\nSurrogates\nTRAC\nDROLS\nlNASA STIF\nSTAR\nRECON\n\nJI\nlLibrarians\n\nNASA\n\nl\n\n*\n\nl\nGatekeepers\n\nDODMASA\n\n1\n\nlLinking Agents\n\nContractors\n& Grantees\n\nlKnowledge\n\n1 l+?+l1\nBrokers\n\n$.\n\nUsers\nlAerospace\n\nEngineers\nand Scientists\nl\n\nEngineering\nand Science\nStudents\n\n1\n\nFormal\n\nFigure 3. A Model Depicting the Transfer of Federally Funded Aerospace R&D.\nSurrogates serve as technical report repositories or clearinghouses for the\nproducers and include the Defense Technical Infoxmation Center @TIC), the NASA\nScientific and Technical Information Facility (NASA STIF), and the National Technical\nInformation Service (NTIS). These surrogates have created a variety of technical report\nannouncement journals such as TRAC (Technical Report Announcement Circular) and\n\n. .\n\nSTAR (Scientific and Technical Aerospace Reports) and computerized retrieval systems\nsuch as DROLS @efense RDT&E Online System) and RECON (REmote CONsole)\nthat permit online access to technical report databases.\nThe producers are NASA and the DoD and their contractors and grantees.\nProducers depend upon surrogates and information intermediaries to complete the\nknowledge transfer process. When U.S. government technical reports are published,\nthe initial or primary distribution is made to libraries and technical information centers.\nCopies are sent to surrogates for secondary and subsequent distribution. A limited\nnumber are set aside to be used by the author for the "scientist-to-scientist" exchange\nof information at the individual level.\nInformation intermediaries are, in large part, librarians and technical information\nspecialists in academia, government, and industry. Information intermediaries represent\nthe producers and serve as what McGowan and Loveless (1981) describe as "knowledge\nbrokers" or "linking agents." The more "active" the intermediary, the more effective\nthe transfer process becomes (Goldhar and Lund, 1985). Active intermediaries take\ninformation from one place and move it to another, often face-to-face. Passive\ninformation intermediaries, on the other hand, "simply array information for the taking,\nrelying on the initiative of the user to request or search out the information that may\nbe needed" (Eveland, 1987).\nTwo problems exist with the formal part of the system. First, the formal part\nof the system uses one-way producer-to-user transmission. The problem with this kind\nof transmission is that such formal one-way "supply side" transfer procedures do not\nseem to be responsive to the user context (Bikson, et al., 1984). Second, the formal\npart relies heavily on information intermediaries to complete the knowledge transfer\nprocess. Empirical findings on the effectiveness of information intermediaries and the\nrole(s) they play in knowledge transfer are sparse and inconclusive.\nThe problem with the informal part of the system is that users can learn from\ncollegial contacts only what those contacts happen to know. Ample evidence supports\nthe claim that no one researcher can know about or keep up with al of the research\nl\nin hisher area(s) of interest. Like other members of the scientific community,\naerospace engineers and scientists are faced with the problem of too much information\nto know about, to keep up with, and to screen -- information that is becoming more\ninterdisciplinary in nature and more international in scope.\n\nTHE DoD PERSPECTIVE\nThe U.S. aerospace industry exhibits certain characteristics which make it unique\namong other industries. F r t the U.S. aerospace sector leads all other industries in\nis,\nexpenditures for R&D (U.S. Department of Commerce, 1990). Second, the U.S.\naerospace industry has benefitted as a technological "borrower" from developments in\nother industries such as metallurgy, materials, chemicals, and petroleum (Mowery and\nRosenberg, 1982). Third, the aerospace industry, in particular the commercial aviation\nsector, is characterized by the high degree of systemic complexity embodied in its\nproducts. Finally, the U.S. aerospace industry, principally the commercial aviation\nsector, has been the beneficiary of federally funded R&D for nearly a century. The\ncommercial aviation sector has also benefitted from considerable investment, in terms\nof research and procurement, by the Department of Defense @OD). "Although not\nintended to support innovation in any but military airframe and propulsion technologies,\n[this investment] has, nonetheless, yielded indirect, but very important, technological\nspillovers to the commercial aimaft industry" (Mowery, 1985).\nThe DoD plays an enormously significantly role in the "supply-push" side of\nthe aerospace knowledge diffusion process. Research supported by the DoD has\nyielded indirect, but very important, innovative spillovers to the commercial aircraft\nsector of the U.S. aerospace industry, most notably in the areas of airframe\ndevelopment, a i r 4 propulsion, avionics, and flight control systems. The demands\nof the military for performance pushed the development and early application of many\ntechnologies. The military supported jet engine development, provided continued\nsupport for the development of specific military engines whose cores were adapted for\ncommercial use, and provided the test-beds for the technological development of early\ni&\n(March, 1989). The development of the first jet engine in the\ncommercial jet ar\nUnited States was financed entirely by the DoD, reflecting "both the perceived military\nurgency of the project, and the lack of interest in the development of such an engine\nexpressed by commercial aircraft f m s prior to 1940" (Mowery and Rosenberg, 1982).\n\nData and Research Methods\nThe &ta for this paper were collected as parts of Phases 1, 2 and 3 of the\nNASAIDoD Aerospace Knowledge Diffusion Project. The results of surveys conducted in each Phase are reported separately. These results comprise only a selected\nportion of the DoD data collected in the Project.\nPhase 1. The sample for Phase 1 of the NASA/DoD Aerospace Knowledge\nDiffusion Project was drawn from the membership of the American Institute of\nAstronautics and Aeronautics (AIAA) as of January, 1988. The AIAA is a professional\nresearch society comprised of aerospace engineers and scientists. A twenty percent\nsample of AIAA members were selected for the Phase 1 surveys.\nThree surveys of AIAA members were conducted as part of Phase 1. The\nsample for the first survey was 3298 AIAA members. 2016 members returned usable\nquestionnaires. The second survey had a sample of 1735 members and 975 usable\nquestionnaires were returned. For the third survey, the numbers were 1705 and 955\n\nrespectively. In earlier research, (Kennedy and Pinelli, 1990) we reported an analysis\nh\na\nof the response rates and patterns. T e adjusted response rate for these surveys w s\nbetween 65 and 70 percent. The surveys w e n conducted from May 1989 through\nFebruary 1990.\nThe first questionnaire focused on the following topics: the use and evaluation\nof conference and meeting papers, journal articles, government technical reports, and\nin-house technical reports. It also contained questions related to the use of information\ntechnology, the steps used in conducting information searches and demographic\ninformation. This survey is not reported here.\nThe second questionnaire focused on the use and evaluation of NASA technical\nreports, DoD technical reports, AGARD technical reports, foreign technical reports,\njournal articles and conference and meeting papers. The questionnaire also asked\nabout the current sources of research funding and demographic information, Figures\n4 through 9 are based on these data. Eighty-four percent of these respondents received\nsome federal funding. Most are well-educated: 25 percent have a BS; 39 percent a\nMS; and 27 percent a Ph.D. Eighty-four percent were trained as engineers and eleven\npercent as scientists, but 67 percent classify their current duties as engineers.\nFigure 4 shows the proportion of respondents who used a NASA, DoD or\nAGARD technical report in the six months prior to completing the questionnaire.\n\nPercent\n\nV\n\nDOD\nAGARD\nUsed one or more times in past 6 months\nNASA\n\nFigure 4. Use of Technical Reports by U.S. Aerospace Engineers and Scientists.\n\nApproximately 50 percent of the sample reported using at least one NASA technical\nreport in the period. Forty-three percent reported using a DoD technical report and\nabout 19 percent said they used at least one AGARD technical qmt.\nThe respondents were asked to evaluate the importance of information s o ~ s\nin pcrfoxmhg their currcnt professional duties. They were asked to use a five point\nscale where the end scores were "very important1\' and "not at all jtnportEUltl\', Figure\n5 shows the proportion who answered with either a "1" or a "2" on the scale.\n\nV\n\nNASA\nDOD\nAGARD\nOne or two on a five point scale\n\nFigure 5. Importance of Technical Reports to\nU.S. Aerospace Engineers and Scientists.\nForty-one percent reported that DoD technical reports were important in performing\ntheir current duties. The percentages of the sample reporting similar importance for\nNASA and AGARD technical reports were 51 and 17 percent respectively. The data\nfrom Figures 4 and 5 indicate that the NASA and DoD technical reports were used\nregularly by U.S.aerospace researchers and that these technical reports were important\nto their research.\nThose who reported they did not use each of the technical reports were asked\nthe reasons why they were not used. Figure 6 contains the proportion who responded\n"yes" to each reason when asked specifically about DoD reports. The reasons reported\nin figure 6 were: not available (27 percent); not used in my discipline (18 percent);\nand, not timely (7 percent). However, the reason offered most often for not using DoD\ntechnical reports was that they were not relevant to the research being conducted (40\npercent). Only 2 percent of the researchers cited problems with the reliability or\naccuracy as reasons for not using DoD technical reports.\n\nPercent\n\n"\n\nNot relevant\n\nNot available\n\nNot used in\nNot timely\ndiscipline\nOne or two on a five point scale\n\nFigure 6.

Substantial partions reported obtaining DoD technical reports from NTIS\n(39 percent) and from DoD (37 percent). These data indicate that while the largest\npercentage came from libraries, many researchers used other means of obtaining DoD\ntechnical reports.\n\n)\nUsers were asked to rate DoD technical reports (figure 8.

Over three-fourths of the users gave the two highest responses when\nasked about the quality (80 percent) and accuracy (78 percent) of DoD technical\nreports. High ratings were also given to the organization (59 percent) and timeliness\n(56 percent) of the reports.\nMost users felt that relevance (72 percent) and accessibility (72 percent)\ninfluenced their decision to use DoD technical reports (figure 9). Familiarity (62\npercent), technical quality (56 percent) and ease of use (54 percent) also influenced\nmore than one-half of the users. Together, the data in figures 7 through 9 indicate\nthat users of DoD technical reports rated them highly in quality and accuracy, used\nthem because they are relevant and accessible, and received them primarily from a\nlibrary.\n\n70\n\n-\n\n60-\n\n40 30 20 50\n\nPercent\n\n10 n\n-\n\nu\n\nRelevance\n\nAccessibility\n\nFamiliarity\n\nTechnical\nEase of use\nQuality\nOne or two on a five point scale\nFigure 9.

The data in figure 10 indicate that only a small proportion of\nthe sample used these sources. STAR had been used by 24 percent of the sample and\nfewer than 50 percent were aware that it exists. Two percent of the sample used CAB\nand 94 percent were not aware of its existence. Use of on line systems was low and\nranged fiom a high of 18 percent for NTIS to a low of about 4 percent for DROLS.\nOverall, use of these products was low; most respondents were simply not aware of\nmany of these sources.\n\nPhase 3. In Phase 3 of the NASA/DoD Aerospace Knowledge Diffusion Project\nsurveys were conducted among aerospace students, faculty, and librarians in aerospace\nor engineering libraries. The student survey consisted of students who were enrolled\nin a capstone design course that was funded by NASA through the University Space\nResearch Association. Forty-four design courses were funded in the 1989-1990 school\nyear. Of this group 33 schools participated in the survey. Some schools could not\nparticipate because their capstone design course was taught in the fall and the student\nsurvey was conducted during April and May 1990. Twenty-one of the courses were\ntaught in aerospace departments, twelve in other departments, primarily mechanical\nengineering and architecture. Useable questionnaires were returned by 591 students.\nThe faculty who participated in the survey were members of aerospace\ndepartments where the USRA design courses were taught. Those faculty who were\nsent questionnaires in Phase 1 were excluded fiom the sample. Questionnaires were\nsent to 501 faculty and 275 returned them by early summer. The faculty and student\nquestionnaires were almost identical. They focused on the knowledge and use of\ntechnical reports, training in technical communications, the use of bibliographic\ndatabases and demographic characteristics.\nIn the Phase 3 questionnaires, the respondents were not asked how many times\nthey used an information source as was asked in Phase 1. Rather they were asked how\noften, on a five point scale, they had used information sources during the current\nschool year. Figure 11 shows the distribution of use for five information sources. As\nmight be expected, the faculty used journal articles (80 percent) most often followed\nby NASA technical reports (39 percent). Faculty made less use of DoD, AGARD, and\nforeign technical reports. Students, however, used journal articles and NASA technical\nreports about equally (52 percent and 51 percent, respectively) and made greater use\nof NASA technical reports than did faculty members. It might be expected that the\nstudents in these design courses would make relatively heavy use of NASA technical\nreports. DoD, AGARD, and Foreign technical reports were used relatively less often.\nThe faculty and students rated the importance of information sources in the\nsame ranking as their use (figure 12). Most faculty (87 percent) rated journal articles\nas one or two on a five point scale. The students rated journal articles (58 percent)\nand NASA technical reports (55 percent) as about equally important. Both faculty (26\npercent) and students (16 percent) rated DoD technical reports as relatively more\nimportant than would be expected from their use.\n\nFaculty\nStudents\n\nPercent 40\n30\n\n20\n10\n\nJournal articles NASA TRs DOD TRs AGARD TRs Foreign TRs\nOne or two on a five point scale\nFigure 11.

The fmt survey,\nconducted as part of Phase 2, included 156 technical libraries located within\ngovernment and indusmal organizations that held aerospace collections including U.S.\ngovernment technical reports. The second survey, conducted as part of Phase 3,\nincluded 68 academic libraries associated with aerospace engineering programs.\n\nt\nOf the f ~ s group, most libraries or technical information centers (TIC) were\ncost centers in which the librarymc costs were charged to the overhead of the\norganization (figure 14).

The NASADoD Aerospace Knowledge\nDiffusion Research Project seeks to remedy this situation by exploring the interface\nbetween the user, the information products and services used (e.g., NASA and DoD\ntechnical reports), and the criteria and factors associated with the selection or use of\na particular information product or senice.\nOverall, the data collected thus f a . indicate that DoD technical reports are an\nimportant information source to the U.S. aerospace research community. Researchers\nand intermediaries in government and industry settings tend to use them more regularly\nthan faculty, students, and intermediaries in academic settings. The differences,\nhowever, may be due to the samples selected for Phase 3 of the NASADoD Aerospace\nKnowledge Diffusion Project. Further analysis is needed, however, before definitive\nconclusions and interpretations can be reached.\n\nREFERENCES\nBikson, Tora K; Barbara E. Quint; and Leland L. Johnson.
