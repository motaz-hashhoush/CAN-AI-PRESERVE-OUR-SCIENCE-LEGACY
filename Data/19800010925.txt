b'Perspective\nRobert\nNASA Langley\n\non the Results\nJ. Huston\nResearch Center\n\nThis paper is an effort\nto put some of the things that we have found from the\nNASA study into perspective.\nI would like to start\nout by covering\nsome issues\nthat were not covered in detail\nin our discussions\n(Figure 1).\nOne of the questions that we were originally\nasked was:\nis additional\naircraft\nprotection\nrequired?\nYou should have noticed\nthat air transport\naircraft\nwere included\nin\nthe calculations\nof the risk profile,\nand, in fact,\nin the specific\nexamples\nthat were cited,\nyou noted that the expected losses at the various airports\nwere\nquite low.\nIndependently,\nwe have had Boeing, Lockheed, and Douglas analyzing\neach of their\nown aircraft,\nusing fiber\ndissemination\nfootprints\nthat have been\ncalculated\nfor crash fires\nand explosions\non an airport\nwhere quite high exposures have been predicted.\nWe found, in the analysis\nof the aircraft\nsystems,\nthat the key issue that prevented aircraft\nfrom being considered\nperhaps totally\ninvulnerable\nwas the fact that occasionally\naircraft\navionic\nbay doors would be\nopen.\nOn those occasions,\nwe found that the interior\nexposure was sufficient\nto\nfail\none or two pieces of avionics\nequipment in a fleet\nof aircraft\nthat were\nsitting\non the ground where an aircraft\naccident\nhad occurred.\nThat fact suggests that some precautionary\nmeasures may be prudent.\nIf you have an aircraft\ncrash fire\nreleasing\ncarbon fibers\non an airport\nit makes sense to close the\ndoors on the aircraft\nand not allow interior\nexposure to carbon fibers.\nWe have also looked at fire-release\nstrips\nas a possible\ncause of power interruptions.\nOur calculations\nshow that only at a probability\nof one chance in a\nthousand will\nwe be able to get power interruptions\nfrom the kind of composite\nThis\nstrips\nthat were generated at China Lake and Dugway Proving Ground tests.\nkind of failure,\nincidently,\nis equivalent\nto the interruption\nthat occurs when\na squirrel\nshorts a powerline\nto ground.\nthe amount of carbon fiber\ndeThe generation\nof composite strips\nand, in fact,\nbris that is actually\nfound after a fire,\nsuggests very clearly\nthat carbon fiber debris should be cleaned up.\nDr. Bell\'s\npaper, Reference 1, showed the mass\nbalance distribution\nof carbon fiber\nfrom burned composites.\nThe amount of\nin fact,\nmany times the amount of free fiber\ndebris or residue was quite large,\nTherefore,\nprudent practice\nwould suggest that\nthat is released by the burn.\nthe aircraft\nowner go in and clean up the composite debris of an accident\nto\nAt this time it is the responsibility\nprevent a secondary release of fibers.\nof an aircraft\nowner to clean up an accident\nso the extension\nof that requirement to include\ncomposite debris would be normal practice.\nIt should be pointed out that some unique carbon composites\ncould be developed\nin the future.\nThe term unique here applies\nto a carbon composite which has a\nDr. Bell\'s\npaper described\nrelease characteristic\ndifferent\nfrom the average.\nIt is possible\nthat in the future,\none composite with such a characteristic.\nas additional\ncarbon composite concepts are developed,\nother unique composites\ncould turn up but we have also developed some test methods that are appropriate\n213\n\nfor evaluating\nthe fiber\nwill\nbe used to analyze\n\nrelease characteristics.\nthe potential\nrelease\n\nWe think that\nfrom new concepts.\n\nthese\n\nmethods\n\nAs for the assumptions\ninherent\nin this study,\nFigure 2 lists\nthose that we\nfeel result\nin a conservative\nfinal\nanswer.\nOur analysis\nassumptions\nhave\nincluded\none percent release for a crash fire and 3 and a half percent release\nfor a crash explosion.\nThis assumption was based on the amount of material\nthat we had found to be released\nfrom specimen tests.\nBased on the data recently\nacquired from the outdoor tests,\nwe see considerably\nless release than\nTherefore\nwe feel that our estimate\nis quite conservative\nhere.\nthat.\nIn the case of the explosive\nrelease model that A. D. Little\nuses (Reference\n2), the analysis\nis considered\nto be conservative,\nthat is it gives excessive\nfiber\nconcentrations\nbecause it is really\na ground-level\nfiber\nrelease and\nnot an explosive\nplume that is carried\nup in the developed fire\nplume.\nOur analysis\nat this point ignores the filter\neffect\non fiber\nlength.\nDr.\nElber\'s\npaper (Reference\n3), showed that not only did filtration\nreduce the\nnumber of fibers\nthat entered into either\ncases or buildings,\nbut that it also\nprovided an effective\nshortening\nof the fiber\nlength spectrum.\nThis phenomenon\nhas a strong effect\non the failure\nrate, as shown by Mr. Taback\'s paper (ReferTherefore\nthe fibers\nthat enter a filtered\nenclosure\nare not as\nence 4).\ndamaging as the fibers\nexterior\nto that enclosure.\nOur analysis\nhas not included that effect.\nWe have based our equipment vulnerabilities\non tests done with 1970 technology\nAnd as we see the future,\nelectronics,\navionics,\navionics\nand electronics.\nand computer design and packaging is aiming towards low power, well-protected\ncircuitry.\nSome of the more recent aircraft\ndesigns are utilizing\ntotally\nairconditioned\navionics\nbays, primarily\nto increase\nthe effective\nreliability\nof\navionics.\nThis effect\nis not considered\nin our analysis.\nThe equipment failure\nmodel over-predicts\nthe failure\nrate for multi-fiber\nsensitive\nequipment.\nTest data described\nby Mr. Taback (Reference\n4) shows the\nThere is a lot of equipment\nmulti-fiber\neffect\non equipment

final\nitem on this list\nof conservative\nassumptions\nis that the analysis\nis\nmade assuming that no precautions\nare taken against\na known carbon fiber\naccident.\nEarlier,\nI pointed out that aircraft\navionics\ncan be effectively\nproby simply closing\nthe avionics\ntected,\nwhen a crash fire\noccurs in an airport,\nbay doors to prevent penetration\nby carbon fibers.\nAlso, Mr. Taback (Reference 4) pointed out that in the worst case, the range of a scanning beam M.L.S.\nlanding aid would be effectively\nreduced by 45% if an approaching\naircraft\nwas\nflown directly\ndown the

the crash cause was undetermined\nand could have been related\nto the operating\ncondition\nof the landing aid.\nThese examples of prudent precautions\nwill\nobviously\nbe expanded if cost effective measures are found suitable\neven with the current\nlevel of projected\nrisk.\nThere are limitations\nin the analysis\n(Figure 3).\nOne is that the data sample\nis small.\nWe have only about 250 specimen burns in which to quantify\nthe fiber\nrelease data.\nIn addition,\nwe have five outdoor tests in the most recent Dugway\nProving Ground experiments\nthat quantify\nthe carbon fiber\nrelease.\nIt is a\nsmall sample of data upon which to base our analysis.\nIn addition,\nthe total\nvariety\nof equipment that we have examined for fiber\nvulnerability,\neither\nin\nthe chamber here at Langley,\nat the Army Ballistic\nResearch Laboratory,\nor in\nthe work that has been done by the Department of Commerce Bureau of Standards,\nconsists\nonly of about 150 pieces of equipment.\nWe have had to have quantified\nthe vulnerability\nof all of the equipment considered\nnationally\nfrom a very\nlimited\nnumber of tests.\nWe are.aware of and have considered\nother data

The answer is\nmercial\nand industrial\ninstallations.\nvery simple, what has been left\nout is the potential\nrisk from military\nairThat is the subject\ncraft\ncrashes and the potential\ndamage to military\nsites.\nof Department of Defense analyses.\nIt is appropriate\nto review the key findings\nof this study (Figure 4).\nWe\nknow that the release of fibers\ndoes require\nagitation\nof the composite residue.\nWe see, from the evidence that we have, that a substantial\nportion\nof the\nWe see, from our specimen tests,\nthat about\ncarbon fiber\nis oxidized\naway.\none percent of the available\nfiber\nis released,\nbut in our outdoor tests,\nwe\nfound only about 0.13 percent released or about a factor\nof eight conservative\nOne final\npoint is that most\nfrom our assumptions\nin our risk calculations.\nThis point should be amplified\nbereleased single\nfibers\nare very short.\ncause we have had some specific\nexamples of released fibers\nwhere the averages\nA look at the sensitivity\nof\nare longer than what we used in our analysis.\n215\n\nthe risk estimates\nto the average fiber\nlength is appropirate.\nIf we normalize\nthe risk at the 3 mm length used in the risk calculations,\nwe can study the\neffect\nof fiber\nlength on the risk.\nIn our large scale tests in the Dahlgren\nshock tube, we found a mean fiber\nlength of 2 millimeters.\nNow perhaps that\nis because of the extreme agitation\nof operating\non the composite material\nwith the rotisserie.\nHowever, in the outdoor tests we found a mean fiber\nlength,\nin the worst case, of about 5 millimeters.\nNow, what is the effect\nof\nthe mean fiber\nlength on the mean exposure level for failure?\nIsrael Taback\n(Reference 4) pointed out several\npossibilities.\nOne possibility\nis that E\nbar is proportional\nto one over the length.\nAnother possibility\nis that E\nbar is proportional\nto one over the length cubed.\nFigure 5 shows the effect\nof these two variations\nin the mean exposure to failure\non the normalized\nrisk\nassuming all equipment follows\neither\none law or the other.\nThe notation\nindicates\nthe lengths obtained\nfrom the large scale tests.\nIt is appropriate\nto point out that at least we have bracketed\nthe large scale test data.\nThe\nactual value of the risk could vary at the most, as a result\nof fiber\nlength,\nby a factor\nof 2. Considering\nthe fiber\nrelease characteristics\nas a whole,\nincluding\npercentage\nreleased\nas well as length,\nit would appear that we\nover-estimated\nthe potential\ndamage by somewhere between a factor\nof 4 and a\nfactor\nof 8.\n\nIf we review the key findings\nin the area of vulnerability\nof equipment,\n(Figure 6), we find that the damage done by released fibers\nis not as severe\nas once thought.\nThe reason is that equipment vulnerability\nis lower for the\ncurrently\nacceptable\nstructural\nfibers\nthan for the very highly\ngraphitic\nfibers\nonce considered.\nIf highly graphitic\nfibers\n(possessing\nmodulus at elasticity\ntwo times that obtainable\nwith current\nstructural\nfibers)\nare found acceptable\nin the future,\nthe base vulnerability\nlevel would have to be reevaluated.\nWe\nfind from our test data that vulnerability\nof domestic and industrial\nelectronics and avionics\nis very low.\nThe vulnerability\nof industrial\nelectronics\nand\navionics\nis low primarily\nbecause they are conformly\ncoated and well protected.\nIn addition\nour industrial\npower arc studies\nshow that power vulnerability\nis\nlow and unlikely\nto cause damage when properly\nfused.\nWe have found that\n110 volt motors and home appliances\ncan not be hurt by carbon fibers.\nOur present assessment of the risk,\nusing current\nestimates\nof the carbon fiber\nrelease from civil\naircraft\nand conservative\nvulnerability\ndata, indicated\nthat\nthe expected annual cost is insignificant\n(Figure 7).\nA comparison of the\nresults\nfrom the A. D. Little\nand the OR1 studies\n(Figure 8) shows quite reasonable agreement.\nWhile the details\nof the risk profiles\nare slightly\ndifferent, the expected annual cost for air transport\nfor either\nis under $500.\nAdding the expected dollar\nloss from crash fires\nof carbon composite general\nCompared with the mean\naviation\naircraft\nadds about 50% to the mean cost.\ncost of the aircraft\naccidents\nthe expected annual cost is an insignificant\nnumber.\nThe FAA study of 1966-1975 aircraft\naccident\ncosts (Reference\n5)\nshowed that the costs of air transport\naircraft\naccidents\nrange from less\nthan a million\ndollars\nto nearly fifty\nmillion\ndollars\n(non-fire\naccidents\nThe mean cost of those accidents\nwhere the aircraft\nsustained\nare included).\nat least substantial\ndamage ranged from 5 million\ndollars\nfor small jet aircraft\nto in excess of 10 million\ndollars\nfor large jet aircraft.\nTherefore,\n216\n\nconsidering\nthe annual number of aircraft\ncrashes,\nthe $500 annual potential\ndamage from released carbon fiber\nmust be compared with annual aircraft\ncrash\ncosts of nearly 100 million\ndollars\n(based on 1974 dollars).\nConsidering\nthat\nevent is basically\na low cost event.\ncomparison,the\nworst case, low probability\nFigure 8 shows that there is only about one chance in 2000 of exceeding\nOur studies\nshow that there is no need for additional\n$150,000 damage annually.\nand the potential\nshock hazard is inprotection\nof civil\naircraft\navionics,\nsignificant,\nhence risk to life\nshould not be a consideration\nin carbon fiber\napplications.\n\nIn conclusion,\nwe have some work to do (Figure 9).\nWe have completed the\nWe will\npublish\nthis conference\nplanned work on the agreed to schedule.\ncomplete and publish\nthe analysis\nof our large scale outdoor\nproceedings,\ntests,\nand complete our final\nNASA summary report.\nNASA efforts\nin the\ncarbon fiber\nhazard area will\nbe completed when all NASA studies\nare\npublished.\nReferences\n1.
