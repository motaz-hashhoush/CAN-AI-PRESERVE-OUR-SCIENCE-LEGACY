Marshall Space Flight\nCenter (TJSFC) was responsible for the manatemant, design, development, installation, maintenance, and operation of the Frenchman\'s Reef Solar Cooling System. The Frenchman\'s Reef site was\ndesignated as an Operational Test Site within the Solar Heating\nand Cooling Development Program\nwent of Ener 0j .\t\ngy\n\nF15-urleso\n\nA\n\nin\n\nand,\n\nSeptember, 1.979 by the Depart21.\n\nContract DEN8-000005 was awarded to the Sunmaster Corporation,\nCorning, Now York, for the design, development, installation, and\ncheckout of the solar energy collection system,\' Contract DEN8-000007\nwas awarded to the Carrier Corporation, Syracuse, New York, for the\ndesign, development, and fabrication of the Solar Absorption Machine\n(SAM) 120 solar absorption chiller,* and Contract DEN-000021 was awarded\nto Raffa Industries, LTD., Vt. Lauderdale, Florida, for the installation of the SAM 120 chiller, The Initial contract was awarded and work\nstarted in January, 1979, and the SAM 120 chiller installation was\ncompleted in July, 1981.\n\nI\n\n\'L-\n\n3, SYSTEM DESCRIPTION\nSite: The Frenchman\'s Reof flolid;,ty Inn Hotel is located on\nthe southeastern point of land\n\nat\n\nthe ontrance to the Char-\n\nlot#^e Amalie Harbor, St. Thomas, U. S. Virgin Islands, at\n18 0 20\n\n1 North latitude and 64 0 57 1 West longitude,\n\nThe hotel\n\nhas three largo wings designated 11B wing", 11 C wing", and I\'D\nwing" and a smaller detached "A wing". The hotel contains\nover 350 guest rooms, and has the lobby, ballrooms, ft restaurant, a lounge, and several shops\n\non the\n\nthird and fourth\n\nlevels of I \'D wing". The hotel\' .9 mechanical plant, called the\n"Total Energy Room", is located below the parking lot and con-\n\ntains diesel electric generating oquipment, desalinization\nunits, absorption c1ii1lers, boilers, a sewage treatment\nsystem, cistern for fresh and salt water, and associated\nequipment. The hotel is essentially self sufficient An that\n\nit generates its own electrical power, produces fresh potable\nsea water, and treats its own sewage. In other than\nwater from\nnormal conditions power is available from the island\'s utility,\nand fresh water is purchased and delivered in -trucks,\nThe individual guest rooms are cooled by conventional type air\nconditioner units installed in each room. The public areas\nsuch as ballrooms, restaurant, the lounge, lobby, and shops are\ncooled by chilled water produced by the largo absorption chillers, The chilled water is also used to cool hot water delivered\nby the desalinization units \'to cold water service \'temperatures.\n\nSalt water is pumped from the soft some 90 feet below to a cis-torn\n\n2\n0\n\nx_r\n\n\'A\n\nrwhere it is Subsequont\n\nly itt-c-d\n\nby tho do..;aHni.*., Itj()jj till its\n\nto produce fresh pot ablo wat or, and to tiorvo ati a ht` it I , o-\n\njection medium for\n\ntho absorption chillors,\nThe, le rencliman\'s Reof Solar Cooling\n\nSolar (.o2li nt; \'.L\'eii\t\n\nSystem consists of two subsystems:\n\nthe\n\nSolar Collection\n\nSubsystem and the Chiller Subsystem. (sec Figure 3.)\nThe Solar Collection Subsyslem consists of the following:\n956 Sunmaster DEC-8A solar collector modu\'les,\n2 2500 gallon tanks.\n7 Pumps with associated piping, and valves.\nAndovor Controls Sunloggor solar controller\nwith assoclatod wiring, sensors relays,\nand printing terminal which provides\nco,latrol and data acquisition functions.\nEach of -the Sunmaster DEC-8A solar Collector modules employs\neight evacuated glass tube solar collectors and one Argonne\nNational Laboratories designed compound parabolic cusp reflector mounted to a support. structure, The reflector serves\nto concentrate the\n\nsorbers throughout\n\ns\n\nolar radiation onto the glass tube ab-\n\nthe\n\nsolar day, maximizing the solar energy\n\ncollection. The tubes are ronnected to common supply and drain\nmanifolds which are insulated to minimize, heat loss. Each\ncollector module has an effective collection area of approximately 14 square feet, and\n\nthe\n\ntotal field has an ap-\n\nerture area of 13,384 square feet. Of the 956 total modules,\n354 modules are installed\n\non\n\n"D wing", 390 are on "C wing", and\n\n212 are on "B wing". Collectors are mounted on each wing, in\ntwo arrays: an upper array and a lower array for a total of\n\n3\n\nsix\n\na\n\nrrays. Each of the -six arrays\n\nifs\n\nserviev-d by its own\n\npump. Arrays are oriented to the south and inolined 17 1 from\nthe horizontal.\nTwo 2500 gallon tanks serve as storage and "sump" tanks, Two\nin\ntanks, one higher than the other, were required\norder to\npxovide the accessary capacity and to be compatible with the\nhotel\'s load-bearing; structure, Heated solar water returning\nthe\nfrom\ncollector arrays empties into the upper tank. A pipe\nlocated 8 inches above the bottom of the upper tank transports\nwater from the upper to lower tank. The lower tank server as\na "sump , or reservoir and supplies water to the 6 collector\narray pumps. The locution of the exit to the transport pipe\nin the upper tank provides a minimum 8-inch deep pool of heated\nwater in the upper tank. Two pipes entering the bottom of the\nupper tank serve to carry heated water to and from the SAM 120\n\nabsorption chiller and cooling subsystem. In the event of a\npower failure or shutdown of the solar subsystem, as at night,\nthe water drains from the solar collector arrays back to and\nfills both upper and lower tanks. Both tanks are insulated\nto minimize heat loss during the drain back mode.\nSix pumps are used to pump water from the lowor 2500 gallon\ntank to the collectors, One pump is provided for each upper\nand lower array on each wing. A bypass line drain-back valve\nis provided for each pump. The drain-back valve is spring\nloaded open, and electrical power is required to close the valve.\nTherefore, if an electrical power failure occurs or is cut off,\n4\n\nthe drain --back valve s opon.; and jiormitk, thv water in thv col-\n\nlectors to drain part, the pumpH to the *;\'Lorat,c tanks, On(,,\nadditional pump i. > provided\n\ncan\n\n"13 wink" in the solar water\n\nreturn line to assist the hot water over a structural wall\nand to the upper tank. All other collectors drain by gravity\nto the upper tank.\nThe solar subsystem opil ration\n\nit,\n\ncontrolled by an Andover\n\nCon-\n\ntrol Sunlogger Solar Controll p r. A pyranometer and temperature,\nand pressure, and flow raze sensors are installed at selected\nlocations throughout the solar subsystem. A minicomputer in\nthe "Sunlogger" controller acquires data from the sensors,\nrecords and integrates the data, and makes programmed decisions.\nThe decisions are implemented by command signals sent to relays\nand switches, which, in turn, actuates bumps and valves and\ncauses the system to operatcl. The "Sunlogger" can be programmed\nand data can be acquired by a remote station through a telephone link and modems.\n\nThe Chiller Subsystem c on,,1:\xe2\x80\xa2;t,s or two large absorption chillers,\npumps, piping, valves, a heat exchanger, and controls. One\nchiller, designated Chiller #2, is a Carrier Corporation Modal\n16JB018 lithium bromide absorpt 3.on chiller nominally rated at\n174 tons, and is powered by 10 phi stream generated by waste heat\nboilers integrated with the diesel. engines exhaust system.\nThe second chiller, designated Chiller #1, is a specially do-\n\nsigned Zithitun bromide absorption chiller developed by the\na\nE\n\nr\n\nCarrior Corporat ion t o I)o taio(l w i t h i lio v tuns wman I .--; not, r 1, ;o 1.1 1\'\n\nsystem.\t\n\nC4111or #1,\t dv6iI-qiat \xc2\xadd tui model SAM 120 by thc Cal\'Hol.\nI\n\nCorporati\'Lon,\t is nominally rated at 120 tons capacity at tll(^\nFrenchman\'s Reef site conditions and has, ft Coefficient of per-\n\nformance (COP) of 0,7.\nSeries chilling\n\nis\n\nOmployod with the chilled water flowing from\n\nthe pumpo,, through Chiller #2, through Chiller #1, and then to\nVie load. Sea water is used to remove chiller rejected heat.\n\nBoth chillers can be used at the same tiffic, or separately. When\nboth chillers are employed at the same time, sea water is divided\nto both machines because of limited sea water availability and\n\npumping capacity.\nThermal energy is provided to Chiller #1, the SAM 120, by hot\nwater. The water can be heated by the solar subsystem, by\n\nmeans of steam and a heat exchanger, 0-- a combination of both\nsteam and the solar subsystem. A three-way valve in the hot\nwater lines actuated by the "Sunlogger" controller controls the\nflow of hot water.to the SAM 120. When the three-way valve is\nopen, hot water flows from the upper tank to the pump, through\nthe heat exchanger, to the SAM 120, and back to the upper tank.\nWhen the three-way valve is closed the hot water circulates from\npump to heat exchanger, to the SAM 120, and back to the pump,\neliminating the solar subsystem from the circuit. A manually\ncontrolled bypass line in the circuit provides the capability\nfor increasing or decreasing the amount of water that is circulated to and from the upper tank.\n6\n\ngg\n\n4.\n\nA proportional valve ( , ontrolti the ,!,towii nupply to the heat\nexchanger, thereby oontrolling the amount of heat added to\nthe hot water. Steam in supplied from boilers\nThe temperature\n\nof\n\nat\n\n\'the, hot water exltintt the SAM\n\n125 psi,\n\n1140\n\nchiller\n\nis measured, and if tho tomporatur y dropt, below it "oet" tomperature, a pneumatic, conLrollor actuate-s the proportional\nsteam valve to permit steam to f low to the heat exchanger. As\nsteam is added, the incoming hot water J9 heated and the exiting\nwater temperature rises until the "set" temperature is reached,\nThen the controller adjusts the steam flow to maintain tue in-\n\ncoming water at sufficient temperature to maintain the "set"\ntemperature An the exiting water. Thus, steam can supplement\nthe heat provided by tile Solar Subsystem to the water, or\nsteam can be used as the ^3olo source of heat whenever solar\nheat is not available such as at night.\n\nInstrumentation: Instrumentation for the solar subsystem consists of a pyranometer and temperature sensors, pressuro transducers, flowmeters, wattmeters, and liquid level sensors, installed at selected locations throughout the solar subsystem\nand integrated with the Andover Controls "Sunlogger" solar\ncon-troller. Data are acquired from 48 analog inputs and 8 dis-\n\ncrete inputs. The I \'Sunloggor" controller is programmed to analyze the acquired data and to issue commands which causes the\nsubsystem to operate as specified. The "Sunlogger" is capable\nof recording instantaneous real-time data, and for converting\nthat data into a daily timo-phased history.

SYSTEM OPE\'RATION\nThe operating sequence begins in the solar (lay morning;\n\nall solar subsystem water stored in the two 2500 gallon tanks.\nIf the, solar tsi"bsystem has boon operating on the previous day,\nthe stored water has been maintained at close to operating\ntemperatures by the insulated tanks. At 7:45 a.m., and with\n\nthe upper tank temperature loss than 2500F, the "8unlogger"\ncontroller "wakes up" the sy-9tom by turning\n\non\n\npumps. The\n\npumps fill the collector arrays at approximately 150 gallons per\nminuto for 20 minutes. After filling, the pumps stop and the\nwater is hold in the collectors until the temperature reaches\n\n200 0 F. At 200 O F the pumps aro started and the water is con-\n\ntinuously circulated from collector arrays to upper tank, to\nlower tank, to pumps, and back to the collectors.\n\t heated water returning to\n\nWhen the temperature of the;\n\nthe upper tank exceeds 215 0 F, and the lower tank temperature\n8\n\nreaches 210\xc2\xb0F, and oyst,em pro p ure in over 5 poi, the Xlow of\nhot water to the SAM 120 chiller is iuitiatod by\n\nthe "Sunloggur"\n\ncontroller opening the three-way valve in the hot water line to\nthe chiller. The "Sunlogger" controller automatically closes\nthe three-way valve and terminates flow from the upper tank\nwhen the temperature of the water in the upper tank fails to\nexceed the SAM 120 exit water temperature by d\xc2\xb0F.\nThe hot water flows from the upper tank to the pumps, to the\n\nheat exchanger, to the SAM 120 culler, to the three-way valve,\nand back to the upper tank where a baffle separates hot water\nreturning from the collectors from the water returning from the\nchiller. The temperature of the water exiting the chiller and\nreturning to\n\nthe heat\n\nthe\n\nupper tank will\n\ndepend on the; chiller load and\n\ncontent and temperature of the solar Heated water. If\n\nthe exit water temperature drops below the selected "set" temperature,\n\nthe steam valve controller\n\nwill cause steam to flow to\n\nthe heat exchanger to sixpplement the solar heat and maintain the\nexit water\n\ntemperature at\n\nthe "set" temperature.\n\ninsoAtion has diminished or during\nperiods of inclement weather when the sun is obscured and the\nupper tank water temperature drops and fails to exceed the SAM\nIn the afternoon when the\n\n120 chiller exiting water\n\ntemperature by 4"F, the "Sunlogger"\n\nwill close the throe-way valve and terminate the flow of solar\nheated water to the SAM 120 chiller.\n\nSteam then\n\nprovides the\n\nnecessary energy to heat the water sufficiently to operate the\n\nchiller. At a\n\np.m. Local, time, the " Sunlogger" is programmed\n\n0\n\ni\t 1\n\nto shut the solar subsystem down, E\'leetri ca l power to t ho\npumps and the drain--baek valves is cut off, tho spring loadrd\ndrain-back valves open to permit by-pftssing the pumps, and the\nwater in the collectors drain to the two 2500 gallon tanks.\nWhenever the electrical power fails, or when an over temperature\nsensor\n\nin\n\nthe collector\n\narray\n\nsenses a temperature in excess of\n\n300\xc2\xb0F, the drain-back valves open and\n\nthe water\n\nin the collector\n\narrays drain back to the two 2500 gallon tanks. When power is\nrestored, the "Sunlogger" controller will close the drain--back\nvalves and actuate the pumps to pump water to the collectors\nprovidea that the temperature in the collector arrays has not\nexceeded 300\xc2\xb0F. On a clear day the over temperature sensor will\nnormally prevent operation until\n\nthe\n\nnext day if power is inter-\n\nrupted longer than 30 ninutes.\n5. PERFORMANCE CONSTRAINTS\nAfter the installation of the solar subsystem in late 1979, both\nthe solar subsystem and cooling subsystem experienced several\nmalfunctions which interrupted operation. However, during those\nperiods of operations between malfunctions the solar subsystem\nperformed consistently and reliably. na.ta was obtained from the\nsolar subsystem and although that data did indicate th. s quality\nof performance, \'the overall assessment of performance was inconclusive because no instrumentation was installed in the chiller subsystem. Installation of sensors in the chiller subsystem\nrequired shutting the system down and cutting holes in the piping\nfor insertion of the sensors. The shutting down of the hotel\'s\n\ns\n\ncooling system was considered to be excessively disruptive to\n\nthe hotel\'s operation and would impose undue lisc +.^ mfort For the\nguests; and it wan decided to postpone instrumenting the chiller subsystem until installation of the new SAM 120 chiller in\nJuly, 1981. subsequently, the MSVC developed portable Check-.\n\nout Test Module (CTM) w i t\'li its " strap - on" transducers and\nsnesors which did not require penetrating the. subsystem\'s piping was used. The portable instrumentation system became avail.able at the time of the installation of the SAM 120 chiller in\nJuly, 1983, and was used in conjunction with the Solar Collection\nSubsystem\'s "Sunlogger" controller to acquire overall solar\ncoll.ing system performance data. The amount of time available\nfor acquiring the overall system data after installation of the\nSAM 120 was limited, but the quality of the data was considered\nto be adequate to develop a realistic analysis of the solar\ncooling system performance.\n\nThe bump initially installed circulating; ho ,16* water from the\nsolar subsystem to the chiller was capable of delivering 200\nto 420 gallons per minute .Groin the solar tanks to the chiller.\nSubsequently, that pump failed and a standby pump was brought\ninto operation. The standby p.iLmp used a larger motor and was\ncapable of pumping over 850 gallons per minute ( gpm) through\nthe chiller. By manually opening the bypass line in the system,\n\nthe flow to aaad from the upper solar t a nk was reduced to approximately 550 gpm. Loth the 550 gpm to and from the solar\ntank, and the 850 gpm through the chiller exceed design flow\nrates for the solar subsystem and the SAM 120 chiller and tend\n\n11\nt\n\nw,\n\nto degrade the performance of the overall. RUstem. The sit(\nintends to replace both pumps in the near future with pumpt\nthat produce the flow rates specified for the solar and co(\nsubsystems. While it is concluded that the excessive pumping\nrates do degrade the performance, no data is \xc2\xb0vailable at this\ntime to determine the degree and extent of the performance\ndegradation experienced.\n\nIn late 1980, several collector modules were found where the\ntransparent plastic film surface had del:aminated from the compound parabolic cusp reflectors. Analysis indicated that dark\nplastic sheeting used to protect the modules during installation\ncreated a "green house" effect, and the resultant heat was\nsufficient to degrade the adhesive between the clear plastic\nsurface and the reflector and produce delaminiation. The Sunmaster Corporation developed a repair kit that consisted of new\nreflectors in sections which could be slipped into place over\nthe existing reflectors and bolted into place. The replacement\nreflector kits fitted and conformed to the shape of the existing\nreflectors such that no degradation of collector performance\nhas been detected. Installation of the replacement reflector\nkit was completed in July, 1981 prior to SAM 120 installation.\n\n6. PERFORMANCE SUMMARY\nThe performance of the system was demonstrated at two levels of\ncompletion. Initially, only the solar collection subsystem was\nmonitored for performance when the operating interface was with\nan existing absorption chiller. Subsequently, the total system\n\n12\n\n..-.. ^. _ _ .\t\n\n.:.. ,,^ ..^.x.h:^:. \xe2\x80\x9e^::: \xe2\x80\xa2_ sir\t\n\n....^._ :-::^.^ \xe2\x80\x9e s._ .,..,^ ^ ..\t\n\n^` .^._,^- .` , .\t\n\n_\t\n\n...\n\n\t\na\nr\nr\n\nwas monitored briefly after the existing chiller was replaced\nby the new SAM 120.\nr;\n\nOn March 19 and 20, .1980, tests were ruts on the Solar Cooling\nSystem with\n\nthe\n\nthen existing Carrier Corporation chiller model.\n\n16JB018 operating with solar heated water.

In addition to offdesign hot water flow rates discussed earlier, climatic conditions were considerably less desirable than for the March,\n1980 tests due to sporadic showers and periods of cloudiness\ninterrupting the solar day.

The March, 1980 test indicated that 31.4 percent\nof available solar energy was delivered to the chiller. There-\n\nfore, it can be expected that with better climatic conditions\nand with a hot water pump whose capacity matches the system\ndesign flow specifications of 450 GPM, the solar subsystem will\ndeliver more of the available solar energy to the chiller. It\nis reasonable to expect that with a properly sized hot water\npump and a 300 BTU/Ft 2 hour day, collector efficiencies could\nreach 35 percent, 31 percent of available energy would be delivered to the chiller, and that solar would contribute up to\n48 percent of the chiller energy requirements for a 124 ton\nload. It is also reasonable to expect the chiller coefficient\nof performance (COP) to reach 0.7 with the proper pump.\n\n16\n\nw^\n\n7. REMARKS\nThe Solar Cooling System at the Frenchman\'s Reef Resort Notel\nOperational Test Site is\n\none of the\n\nlarger solar projects in\n\nthe development program. Tile size of the project and its\n\n.\n\nlocation have made it uniquely valuable as a Development project. The experience derived from the project has contributed\nto program objectives to demonstrate solar energy as a viable\nalternate energy source for the nation.\nsolar cooling system was not configured with the "design" flow rates and control "set po,nts"\nwhen performance measurements of the total system were made.\nAdditional measurements of the total system performance whin\noperating to "design" specifications may be necessary at some\nlater date to fulfill follow-on program objectives.\nIt is unfortunate that the\n\n17\n\nFi\n\nr\n\n1: F\n\nTe\n\nnchman\'\n\nR\n\nf HoB\n\nv Inn H\n\nl.\n\n1 r CfJOli\n\n\t\n\n-^\n\nKaf\t\n\np^\t\n\t\n\nW\t\n\nW\n\n^\t\n\n:3c\n\n\te..^\n\nR\t\n\nC\t\n\nIH\n11f^\'/\t\n\nE\t\n\n4\n\n0\n\nF^1 H\n\nU\t\n\n^ Ca\n\n4i\t\n\n^\t\n\nE\t\n\nOVA\t\nV\n\ne; W\t\n\nH\t\n\nrh\t\n\ntry\t\n\nrc,\'^\t\n\np\n\nw\t\n\n^.\t\n\na\t\n\n19\n\nr,.\n\nH\n\n^\n\npq\n\n^+\n\nk4 }^.\nkt^\t 4\xc2\xa2+\n\n1.4 H\nk\n\npi 1-4\n^+ 4^\n\n0\n\nC:4> H\n\nco\n1\n\n-pro\n\n() 0\n^\nFr p\ny\n\n//Cd\n\nJ\n\n\t\n\nz\n\nt^\n\n.x\n\n\t\n\nY ^\n\nNt-i N\n;I\n\n^^/\n\nO\nV\n\nY\n\nV\n\n^\n\nPA\n\n:>\n\n\t4\'qb\n\n\tF^\n\nH ^\n\t\n\nil l\t\n\n^G\n\nr--^\n\n0VU)\n\nr7\n\nC4 9 0\n\n0\n\n;r,\n\n\'\'\t\n\n20\n\n^t\n6*\n\nt\t\n\ni4\n\np\n\n3\n\n^11\nI\n\n\'T++\t\n\n\xe2\x96\xbarN E\xe2\x80\x94o\n\nIra ^\t\n\n19\n\nns ^"+\n\nV\ni\t\n\nrte\'\t\n\n:^\nW\n\no\nN\n\nx\n\nt IZXUWAL PAGE IS i\n\nrA . n\t\n\t\nVA 0\nt)\t\n\n;e4\nc: ! _^ \xe2\x80\xa2-Hy^ r^t\n\n\xe2\x96\xba\t\n\nAPPROVAL\nSOLAR COOLING SYSTEM PERFORMANCE, FRENCHMAN\' S REEF HOTEL\nST.
