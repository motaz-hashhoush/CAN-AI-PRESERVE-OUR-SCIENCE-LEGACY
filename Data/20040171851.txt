The properties of these jets and the\nFe-rich ejecta will provide clues to the explosion of Cas A.\nCode 662, Goddard Space Flight Center; huiang,rob,rsmith@milkyway.gsfc.nasa.gov\n2Department of Astronomy, University of Maryland\n3Code 7674L, Naval Research Laboratory; jlaming@ssd5.nrl.navy.mil\n41nstitut d\'Estudis Espacials de Catalunya, Espaiia; badenes@ieec.fcr.es\nCode 7655.7, Naval Research Laboratory; fberendse@ssd5.nrl.navy.mil\n6Department of Physics, North Carolina State University; JohnBlondin@ncsu.edu\n7Management Science Department, The George Washington University; professor@cioffi.us\n8Department of Astronomy, University of Minnesota; tdelaney,larry@astro.umn.edu\nCenter for Space Research, MIT; dd,kaf@space.mit.edu\n"Dartmouth College; fesen@snr.dartmouth.edu\n"LOS Alamos National Laboratory; clf@t6.lanl.gov\n"The Johns Hopkins University; parviz,ravi@pha.jhu.edu\n13Rutgers University; jackph@physics.rutgers.edu\n14Arizona Stzte University; jon.morseQasu.edu\n15Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics; plucinsk,slane@head.cfa.harvard.edu\n"Department of Physics and Astronomy, Iowa State University; mkpQiastate.edu\n\n17SRON National Institute for Space Research; j.vink@sron.nl\n\nI \xe2\x80\x99\n\n-2-\n\nSubject h eadings : stars :supernovae-IS M :supern ova r emnants-X- r ays:ISM-Xrays:individual (Cassiopeia A)\n\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe young core-collapse supernova remnant Cassiopeia A is a unique astrophysical laboratory for studying ejecta and shocks in remnants because of its brightness across the\nelectromagnetic spectrum and its well-constrained age and distance. Earlier X-ray observations with the Chandra Observatory have already produced significant results, such as the\ndiscovery of the compact stellar remnant (Tananbaum et al. 1999), identification of major\ntypes of nucleosynthesis products (Hughes et al. 2000, Laming & Hwang 2003, Hwang &\nLaming 2003), measurement of magnetic fields (Vink & Laming 2003), identification of the\nforward and reverse shocks (Gotthelf et al. 2001), and measurement of small-scale proper\nmotions (DeLaney et al. 2003, 2004). The remnant is believed to have lost most of its\nprogenitor mass prior to explosion at 4 Ma (e.g., Willingale et al. 2003, Chevalier & Oishi\n2003, Laming & Hwang 2003).\n\n-\n\nA 1 Ms observation of Cas A was performed as a Very Large Project (VLP) in Chandra\nCycle 5. It was largely motivated by two papers (Laming & Hwang 2003; Hwang & Laming\n2003; hereafter LH03 and HL03), which used Chandra\xe2\x80\x99s subarcsecond angular resolution\nto isolate compact ejecta features in Cas A. Since the reverse shock crosses these knots\nin a very short time compared to the age of the remnant, the extracted knot spectra can\nbe characterized with a single electron temperature and ionization age. These are then\nstraightforwardly compared to model results to infer details of the ejecta density profile, the\nexplosion asymmetry, and with further modest assumptions, the actual Lagrangian mass\ncoordinates of ejecta structures. With the original 50 ks observation, individual ejecta knots\ncould not always be readily isolated when spectra were extracted over several image resolution\nelements. A 1 Ms exposure allows nearly every pixel of the ACIS CCD image of Cas A to\nprovide an acceptable spectrum for fitting. Revisiting the work of LH03 and HL03 with\na larger selection of Cas A ejecta knots would be the first full analysis of its kind and a\nsignificant effort that is well beyond the scope of this letter. In this introductory paper, we\npresent new images, highlight some results immediately revealed by the deep pointing, and\nindicate areas of future work where significant findings are expected.\n\nY\n\n,\n\n-.\n\n-32.\n\nObservations and Data Reduction\n\nCas A was observed for 1 Ms with the backside illuminated S3 chip of the Advanced\nCCD Imaging Spectrometer (ACIS) on the Chandra Observatory. The first 50 ks segment\nwas completed between 8 and 9 February 2004, with the same pointing, frame time (3.2 s),\nand roll angle (325") as for two earlier 50 ks ACIS observations t o facilitate proper motion\nstudies. The remaining 950 ks were executed in eight segments between 14 April and 6 May\n2004 with a 3.0 s frame time and no roll angle constraints (the roll angles drifted from 40"\nto 65"). The aimpoint in the first 50 ks segment (and in the earlier 50 ks observations) is\nroughly 1.9\' SE of the point source, while it is 2.4\' NE in the remaining segments. Cas A\'s\nhigh count rate requires the use of only a single CCD chip and accumulation of the data in\nGRADED mode to avoid telemetry loss. The spectra thus cannot be corrected to reduce the\neffects of charge transfer inefficiency.\nWe retain only those events with energies from 0.3-10 keV and apply time-dependent\ngain corrections for the S3 chip. Time segments with background flares were excluded by\nmaking consistent count-rate cuts based on the off-source light curve. The filtered data set\ncontained 282 million photons over the 5\' extent of Cas A and an exposure time of 980 ks.\n\n3.\n\nResults\n\n3.1. Overview\n\nA three-color composite of Cas A in Si He a (1.78-2.0 keV; red), Fe K (6.52-6.95 keV;\nblue) and 4.2-6.4 keV continuum emission (green) is shown in Figure la. The images have not\nbeen smoothed nor has the continuum contribution been removed (i.e., the images contain\nboth line and continuum photons). The figure shows that the filamentary 4-6 keV continuum\nemission is fragmented, but circular overall, and present throughout the remnant image\n(see also Gotthelf et al. 2001). Most of this emission is probably synchrotron emission\ngenerated at the forward shock. The reverse-shocked ejecta emission, by contrast, is highly\nnon-circular, with the prominent linear jets of Si-rich ejecta (in red) in the northeast, their\nfainter counterparts to the southwest, and Fe-rich ejecta fingers (in blue) extending to the\nforward shock in the southeast (see also Hughes et al. 2000, Hwang et al. 2000).\nThe image revealed several faint point sources around the remnant which matched\nthe positions of optical stars, thereby permitting accurate coordinate transformation of the\nimage relative to the USNO A2.0 catalog. The resulting measured position of the remnant\'s\n(i\ncentral X-ray point source was found to be (52000) cu=23h 23m 27.945sf0.08~; = 58" 48\'\n\n-442.45\xe2\x80\x9d f 0.6\xe2\x80\x9d (see Fesen, Pavlov, & Sanwal 2004, in preparation).\nThe overexposed broadband image shown in Figure l b highlights faint features in Cas A,\nincluding the nearly radial, linear jet structures in the northeast and southwest. An X-ray\njet counterpart in the southwest had been hinted in earlier Chandra observations (Hwang\net al. 2000), but is clearly evident in the new image. It is highlighted in the ratio image of\nSi XI11 He Q! (plus continuum, 1.78-2.0 keV) relative to the 1.3-1.6 keV band (mostly weak\nMg XI and Fe L, in addition to continuum) shown in Figure IC (see also Vink 2004). The\nsouthwest jet filaments are fainter, have a larger opening angle on the sky, and extend to\na slightly smaller radius as measured from the optical expansion center (Thorstensen et al.\n2001), while their northeast counterparts appear t o reach closer to the center. This bipolar\nejecta structure is already known from optical spectral observations (Fesen 2001) that reveal\nhigh-velocity (>10,000 km/s) ejecta knots beyond the forward shock in the jet regions, and\nis also recently seen in 24pm dust emission (Hines et al. 2004).\nThe chemical similarity of the jets is demonstrated by their spectra, shown in Figure\n2. Both the spectrum from a filament in the NE jet and the summed spectrum of two\nSW jet filaments (all at similar radial distance 3.3\xe2\x80\x99 from the center) show strong Si, S, Ar,\nand Ca emission, as well as a Fe K blend. Their thermal characteristics are also similar,\nwith preliminary spectral fits to simple models with an underlying 0 continuum giving\n1 - 1.5 keV and ionization ages net a few times 10\xe2\x80\x9d C ~ - ~ S These\n.\ntemperatures k T of\nknots are similar to typical Si/O-rich knots studied by LH03.\n\n-\n\nIn the southeast, where extremely Fe-rich material has been observed, the spectrum\nof the highly Fe-rich cloud discussed in HL03 is confirmed by the VLP spectrum shown in\nFigure 3 to be virtually pure Fe. The spectrum is dominated by Fe L and Fe K line blends\nand Fe continuum. Highly Fe-rich ejecta are sites of complete Si burning in the explosion,\nand may also harbor some of the 44Ti known to have been synthesized in a-rich freeze out\n(Iyudin et al. 1994, Vink et al. 2001, Vink & Laming 2003). As such, they originated close\nto the explosion center and are very sensitive to the details of the explosion. HL03 estimate\nthat a few percent of the total Fe ejected by the explosion is currently visible in X-rays,\nwhich is similar to the fraction of Ni inferred t o have been mixed out into the envelope\nof SN 1987A by Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities during its explosion (Pinto & Woosley 1988).\nIdentification and modelling of other Fe-rich regions will be the focus of future work, and\nwill offer the best comparisons with theoretical models for Fe-production.\n\n-53.2.\n\nThe Nature of the Jets\n\nJet structures can result from an explosion into local cavities of the interstellar medium\nformed by asymmetric winds in the late evolutionary phases of the progenitor star (Blondin\net al. 1996). However, models of the shock trajectories by Truelove and McKee (1999) as\nimplemented by LH03 (but for lower CSM density), show that the forward shock decelerates\nvery slowly in a local cavity. The reverse shock is thus not strong enough t o progress through\nenough ejecta to yield the relatively high ionization age observed for the plasma in the jetlike region of Cas A. We tentatively conclude that Cas A was formed by an asymmetric\nexplosion that produced jets of ejecta, though more detailed work is required for confirmation.\nThis conclusion is corroborated by the chemical enrichment and high expansion velocities\nof the optically-emitting jet knots (Fesen 2001). Since these are generally accepted as being\nminimally decelerated by the circumstellar medium, an origin in the explosion mechanism is\nsuggested in that their velocities are significantly higher than elsewhere.\nInteresting questions then arise as to the nature and energetics of the jets. A jetinduced explosion (e.g. Khokhlov et al. 1999) requires an overdense jet to explode the star\nand is expected to leave large amounts of Fe ejecta in the jet regions. This contradicts\nexisting X-ray and optical observations of Cas A (e.g. Hughes et al. 2000, Fesen 2001).\nFurthermore, the kick direction for the compact object that is inferred from the motions\nof optical knots (Thorstensen et al. 2001) is not along the jet axis as would be expected,\nbut is instead perpendicular to it. Alternatively, an underdense relativistic jet could be\ndriven by a collapsar (see Zhang, Woosley & Heger 2004, Nagataki et al. 2003). In this\nscenario, the ejecta knots observed in the jet regions could be pulled off at the interface of\nthe jet and ambient ejecta plasma and are unlikely to be Fe-rich. Collapsars are believed to\nproduce super-energetic explosions (i.e., y-ray bursts), but estimates of the explosion energy\nfor Cas A by LH03 at 2 - 4 x lo5\' erg suggest that it was closer to a normal supernova, and\ntherefore unlikely to have actually produced a y-ray burst (Podsiadlowski et al. 2004).\nAsymmetries in normal supernova explosions are much milder (Fryer & Heger 2000,\nScheck et al. 2004). Whether these explosions can produce the observed asymmetry depends\nsensitively on the exploding star. Asymmetries are effectively erased if the star retains much\nof its hydrogen envelope (see Chevalier & Soker 1989 for the case of 1987A). Loss of the\nhydrogen envelope could allow asymmetries to persist through break-out, and this may\nexplain the jet-like structures in Cas A, since it was much less massive at explosion than\nthe progenitor of SN 1987A. Though these arguments are speculative, we expect to reach\nmuch firmer conclusions through spectroscopy of faint jet knots with the VLP da,ta and by\ncoupling hydrodynamics with a treatment of the ionization balance and electron heating.\n\n-6-\n\n3.3.\n\nPoint Source\n\nThe deep image gives no evidence for an extended pulsar wind nebula surrounding the\npoint source. The point-source image is somewhat elongated, but this can be explained by its\nslightly off-axis location in each of the Chandra pointings and the change in off-axis position\ndue to the variation in the spacecraft roll angle, as confirmed by ray-tracing simulations.\nDetailed analysis of the compact source, including spectra and timing, will be presented\nin a future paper. Here we simply note that the best single-component model is a blackbody\n(x2= 493.7 for 315 degrees of freedom) for TE = (4.89 f0.07) x l o 6 K, an emitting surface\nwith radius RE = 0.83f0.03 km and an absorbing column of N H = (1.25f0.03) x\ncm-2.\nAs in previous studies, the temperature is higher than expected from cooling models for a\nN 330 yr old neutron star, and the inferred size of the emitting region is small. Emission from\ndiscrete hot spots on the stellar surface may be indicated (Pavlov et al. 2000, Chakrabarty\net al. 2001). A power law model for the spectrum can be rejected.\n\n4.\n\nConclusions\n\nA new million-second observation of the supernova remnant Cassiopeia A has been obtained with the S3 CCD detector on the Chandra X-ray Observatory. The ejecta have a\nbipolar structure, implying jets that were formed by the explosion. For such asymmetries to\nsurvive beyond the outer layers of the star, the explosion at its source must have an extreme\ncollimation currently only found in hypernova models. Relativistic jets may indeed be indicated by the lack of appreciable Fe in their X-ray spectra, but the total inferred explosion\nenergy for Cas A is closer to that of a normal supernova. Cas A thus provides good evidence\nthat jets may also be produced by normal supernovae. The Fe ejecta observed elsewhere\nin the remnant hold clues to the nucleosynthesis that took place during the explosion. Addressing these kinds of questions with detailed modelling and analysis of these data should\nprovide insights into the explosion of Cas A.\nThis work is supported by a grant from the CXC GO program.
