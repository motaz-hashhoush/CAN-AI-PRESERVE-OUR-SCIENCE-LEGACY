The open-jet observations reveal minor systematic discrepancies from Tollmien's theoretical velocity distribution. The shearing-stress distribution for the partially open jet was determined. The value derived for the ratio of mixing distance to jet width was found to be in close agreement with the corresponding value for the open-jet boundary. The streamline pattern in a partially expanding channel was obtained from the observed velocity distribution and plotted, after which the distribution of the mixing distance for this case was also ascertained.", "title": "Turbulent Jet Expansion", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T18:36:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19930094628, "meta": {"author": {"name": "FORTHMANN E"}, "organization": {}}, "id": "8dd9be9968064b7298b9fbeeb842d125"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2014-07-21T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19930094628, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19930094628, "id": "0788b7ffedb1470e904595ecb8477883", "publicationDate": "1936-03-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19930094628.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19930094628/downloads/19930094628.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19930094628/downloads/19930094628.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19930094628/downloads/19930094628.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
