Foley, Bruce J. Gaumond, and Edward Sestak\nThe Boeing Company\n\nSUMMARY\n\nThe detailed analysis and tradeoff tasks are presented for both the surveillance and\ncommunications functions of an L-band aircraft terminal used with an air traffic control\n(ATC) satellite system, as studied under NASA/ERC contract NAS 12-621. A multisatellite\nconcept is found preferable over single-satellite concepts to provide an ATC satellite surveillance capability. Both continuous multiple-tone ranging and TRW\xe2\x80\x99s BINOR ranging modulation techniques are evaluated for the surveillance signal in terms of link performance and\nimpact on the aircraft terminal complexity. It is concluded that either technique provides\nadequate capability for required North Atlantic surveillance accuracies, although the tone\nsystem results in a simpler terminal design.\nThe effect of different satellite link-routing alternates is treated and the requirements\nfor forward and return data links established for an interrogation/response surveillance system. Techniques of both random- and controlledaccess voice channel usage for an operational system are also evaluated. The stringent power requirements for the satellite-toaircraft voice links lead t o a consideration of alternate voice modulation techniques that\noffer improvements in link threshold performance. A narrowband FM system is recommended, using clipped speech and a phase-lock demodulator in the aircraft receiver. Subsequent link analysis provides parametric voice performance data for all links. A detailed\npropagation study is made, considering propagation effects for L-band transmission through\nthe ionosphere and troposphere, as well as multipath analysis, which concludes that a 2-dB\nfade margin is adequate for operation above a loo elevation angle at L-band. In addition,\nthe effects of external and internal noise sources on the aircraft overall system noise temperature for an SST are given for both low- and high-gain receiving antennas. The final consideration is the establishment of a set of performance criteria goals for an operational communicationq\xe2\x80\x99surveillance system.\n\n1.0 INTRODUCTION\n\nThe purpose of this document is to present the detailed communications/surveillance\nanalysis tasks carried out during the contract. Each of the tasks was undertaken to determine\nspecific aircraft terminal design choices or performance levels. System alternates are developed as required to support the analysis tasks. These system alternates include the results\nof technical interchange meetings held with the customer and system contractors and a review\nof appropriate technical reports relating to air traffic control (ATC) studies.\nSurveillance is the first topic discussed in this report. Section 2.0 examines the\ndifferent system approaches to implementing a surveillance capability for ATC. Included\nfor consideration are both single-satellite systems using interferometer measurement techniques and multiple-satellite systems using range measurement techniques. The multiplesatellite ranging system is found to be preferable. Section 3.0 presents an analysis of two\nspecific modulation techniques for the ranging signal. The first is the tone (subcarrier) ranging method recommended by both RCA and Philco, and the second is the BINOR ranging\nmethod preferred by TRW. Comparative performance levels and terminal complexity are\ngiven for both methods. A detailed link analysis is included to establish the performance\nlevels.\nThe remaining sections of this document cover communications tasks. Included in\nthese are the examination (Sec. 4.0) of several postulated system routing alternates to determine the impact of each on the aircraft terminal design. Of particular importance here are\nthe requirements that each system imposes on the terminal in terms of antenna gain and\npointing control, number of signals processed, amount of transmitter power, and the method\nof channel access. In addition, alternate means of providing access to the voice channels and\nthe requirements imposed on the forward and return links for data transfer are discussed.\nDifferent voice modulation techniques are evaluated in Sec. 5.0 to determine a\npractical method that minimizes the power requirements on the satellite-to-aircraft link.\nThe basic characteristics of speech are presented, and different speech processing schemes\nevaluated. The performance of amplitude, angle, and digital modulation techniques is determined and a specific recommendation is made for the ATC satellite system.\nThe impact of propagation effects on link performance is analyzed in Sec. 6.0.\nIncluded is a detailed investigation of multipath effects over sea water. The computer model\nused for the investigation is described, and comparisons of the analytic predietions and experimental measurements are given for L-band frequencies. The effects of actual aircraft antenna patterns are included, and criteria are given for selecting multipath fading margins. The\nattenuation, dispersion, and delay characteristics of the ionosphere and troposphere are also\ngiven.\nThe total noise environment present at the aircraft receiving terminal is determined\nin Sec. 7.0. The results are used with the characteristics of the receiver system to define\nthe overall satellite-to-aircraft link system noise temperature. Consideration is given to the\neffects of all external antenna noise sources and aircraft self-generated noise.\nLink performance is analyzed in detail in Sec. 8.0 for the voice links. A worst-case\ntabulation of all gains and losses is made for each link between the ATC, satellite, and\naircraft terminals. The analysis treats both a single-channel model and a multichannel model.\nA hard limiter is postulated for the satellite, and the effects of strong signal suppression and\n\n2\n\nintermodulation products are given. Performance data based on the link analysis are\npresented in parametric form to show the significant tradeoffs available between the different terminal parameters.\nSection 9.0 discusses development of the specific system performance criteria. The\ncriteria are based upon the work done in previous sections of this vol e as well as upon the\nrequirements study contained in vol. 11. These criteria parameters represent the measurement yardsticks used to determine how well the actual design meets the criteria. Included\nin the parameters are link performance measurements of grade of service, time availability,\nand service probability as well as qualitative system factors related to economics, responsiveness, growth potential, compatibility, and capacity.\nA strong team effort was involved in conducting the overall study effort. The\ncommunications /surveillance analysis reported in this volume was accomplished in an iteratibe\nmanner with a good amount of technical interchange between the people involved.

As a result of\nthese studies, eight techniques were found to offer possibilities for an ATC surveillance scheme.\nHaving some access to the study data and conclusions, along with other reports, Boeing has\nreviewed these techniques to evaluate them in light of the impact upon the airborne terminal\nof an L-band satellite communications/surveillancesystem in order to configure a practical\nterminal.\nThe techniques considered in the studies are based upon the following parameters,\nused singly or in combination: range, range rate, range difference and derivatives, angles and\nderivatives, and user altitude. All can be classified into either of two major categories: single\nsatellite and multiple satellite. Techniques and principal proponents in the first category are:\nactive two-axis interferometer (Westinghouse), passive two-axis interferometer, passive polar\ncoordinate (TRW), active one-axis spinning interferometer, and swept fan beam (Philco).\nThose in the second category are: passive range differencing (TRW) and active range measurement, both pulse (GE) and tone ranging (RCA and Philco). For all these types, \xe2\x80\x9cpassive\xe2\x80\x9d\nimplies nontransponding users, whereas \xe2\x80\x9cactive\xe2\x80\x9d implies transponding users. The essential\nfeatures of each technique are reviewed in the following sections.\n2.1 Single-Satellite Techniques\nSeveral active and passive single-satellite techniques for navigation and surveillance\nhave been promulgated by various agencies and study contractors.\n2.1.1 Active two-axis interferometer (ref. I).-This concept is based upon a single\nsatellite having a pair of interferometer antennas positioned at right angles to each other and\nparallel to the earth\xe2\x80\x99s surface. Each pair would have an inner antenna to provide coarse-angle\ndeterminations and an outer antenna for fine readings. Typically for L-band configurations,\nthe outer antenna would be at the end of a boom 50 feet from the satellite (giving a baseline\nof at least 100 feet) to give 1 n.mi. of fix accuracy.\nTo determine accurately an aircraft\xe2\x80\x99s position, this system must know precise satellite\nposition and attitude. Thus, four reference stations, including one at the control center,\nwould have to be in simultaneous view of the satellite. These four stations would automatically send ranging pulses to the satellite for relay to a computer center where the information\ncontained would be processed by computer to determine the position and attitude of the\nsatellite in space.\nThe control center also would receive aircraft angle and range data from the satellite,\nand the computer would determine the user aircraft\xe2\x80\x99s position and send it to the user via the\nsatellite. The same position data would also be relayed to traffic control centers for surveillance use. The computer also would program interrogation signals to be sent from the control center via satellite to the user to obtain response to range and angle signals.\nFor global, continuous position-fixing (and communications) capability, eight interferometer-type satellites in 55\xe2\x80\x99 inclined orbits at 6000 n.mi. altitude would be required. In\naddition, 18 ground reference stations to determine the satellite\xe2\x80\x99s precise location and attitude\nand six ground control centers would be needed.\n\n4\n\nFive satellites could afford global coverage if orbited at synchronous altitude. Two\nwould be in equatorial orbits, 120" apart longitudinally, and the other three in polar orbits\nwith their descending nodes such that one is over the North Pole, another over the South\nPole, and a third over the equator. Moreover, if coverage between latitudes 70\' N and 70" S\n(where air traffic is predominant) is acceptable, three geostationary vatellites located 1 20\xc2\xb0\napart could provide useful "near-global" service.\n2.1.2 Passive two-axis interferometer.-This concept is also based upon a singlesatellite two-axis-interferometer technique. It is similar to the preceding active type except\nin one salient respect: the user aircraft does not receive a range signal from the satellite\nnor transpond a range and angle signal to the satellite. Instead. the satellite position and\nattitude data are relayed via the satellite to the user aircraft, along with angle measurenient\nsignals originating at the satellite. Utilizing its own pressure altitude data, the user aircraft\nthen makes an onboard computation of its own position. This technique does not provide\nindependent ATC surveillance of user aircraft position, although automatic position and\ndata reporting from user aircraft via satellite to the ground control center could provide a\npseudo-surveillance function. Also unfavorable is the necessity fur extensive and complex\nequipment aboard each user aircraft.\n2.1.3 Active one-axis spinning interferometer.-This concept consists of a single\nsatellite with a single baseline interferometer. The satellite is in bynchronous orbit and spinning on its vertical axis. Typically, there is an antenna at each end of a single boom 50 feet\nfrom the satellite, giving a 100-foot baseline.\nAs in the two-axis-interferometer concept, signals received at the satellite interferorneter antennas from the user aircraft provide data adequate to describe an angle between the\nsatellite and the user. This technique also requires precise satellite position and attitude\ninformation obtained in the same manner as described previously for the two-axisinterferometer system (Sec. 2.1.1).\n\n2.1.4 Passive polar single-axis interferometer.-Little information is available on this\ntechnique; it appears to be proprietary with TRW. TRW\'s briefing to NASA/ERC showed a\nsingle satellite with a single baseline interferometer using frequencies at X-band or higher.\nThe satellite is in polar orbit and spinning on its vertical axis. In the TRW concept, satellite\nposition and attitude data are generated at the ground control station from tracking and\nephemeris information and transmitted to the user aircraft via the satellite. Position measurement signals are also sent from the satellite to the user aircraft, which then computes its own\nposition. In this technique, satellite attitude control is relatively difficult. The user\'s receiver\nis very complex, requiring a triple phase-locked loop and very narrow loop bandwidths to\nalleviate dynamic errors. Its accuracy potential is slightly worse than that of fixed\ninterferometers.\n2.1.5 Swept fan beam.-This concept is based on angle measurements only, which\nare quite different from methods based on interferometer techniques. Philco\'s fan-beam\nsatellite in synchronous orbit would have two antennas mounted normal to the spin axis and\nperpendicular to each other (ref. 2). The spin-axis would be aligned normal to the orbit\nplane. Thus, as the satellite rotates on its stabilization axis, a thin, fan-shaped beam transmits from one antenna, which sweeps across the earth\'s surface to form a series of circular\narcs. Energy radiated from the second antenna at a different frequency creates a second fanshaped beam that sweeps the earth\'s surface in a direction normal to that of the first beam.\nThe satellite would also transmit an rf pulse to provide a reference for the fan beam with a\nknown point on earth, such as the subsatellite point. Measuring the time interval between\n\n5\n\nthe instant the beams cross the reference point and when they strike the user aircraft would\nsupply the inertial angle and cross-range angle. This information and available satellite ephemeris, orientation, and spin-rate data would be used to obtain true position for the user\naircraft.\n\ni\n\nWith this technique, the user aircraft must compute its own position, or it must relay\nthe measured time interval (via satellite) to the ground control center computer for position\ninformation. This latter procedure is the most amenable to \xe2\x80\x9cindependent surveillance.\xe2\x80\x9d\nHowever, if the onboard user position information is automatically sent to the ground control station via communications satellite, an unlimited number of positiqn fixes (for ATC and\nsearch and rescue) can be provided, because the technique is similar to a ground hyperbolic\nnavaid system.\nThere are numerous potential technological problems in this type of system. For\nexample, accurate time-interval measurements or angle information would be required for\naccurate position fixes. For a synchronous satellite spinning at 180 rpm, the time of the fan\nbeam would have to be measured to an accuracy of 1 psec (or about 25 prad angular measure)\nto achieve 0.7 n.mi. position accuracy. Also, since determination of the maximum beam\nstrength as it passes the user aircraft must be accurate to obtain precise position fixes, high\ntransmitting power on the satel\xe2\x80\x99ite may be required. Finally, a major source of potential\nposition error is the variation of satellite spin-axis direction (attitude instability), spin rate,\nand temperature effects on the antennas (antenna instability) at the time of position fix. Each\nsatellite would have to be periodically calibrated and the spin-axis direction and rate continually updated by ground tracking stations.\n2.2 Multiple-Satellite Techniques\nThe two major alternates under multiple satellite systems consist of active ranging\n(both pulse and tone schemes) and passive range differencing.\n2.2.1 Active ranging. -In this technique, a ground control center would program and\ntransmit a coded interrogation signal addressed to the user aircraft via one of two satellites\nin view. The signal would activate the user\xe2\x80\x99s transponding equipment, causing it to retransmit\nthe signal plus onboard altitude data to all satellites for retransmission to the ground control\ncenter. The user aircraft\xe2\x80\x99s position is then computed at the control center using the known\nsatellite positions (or separation distance), the user aircraft\xe2\x80\x99s altitude, and the round-trip\npropagation times along the two signal paths (pulse ranging), or the phase differences between\ntransmitted and received signal sidetones (cw tone ranging). If three satellites are in ranging\nview, the user aircraft\xe2\x80\x99s altitude can be obtained directly, thereby eliminating the need for\nuser-generated altitude data. User aircraft positions thus determined can be used for ATC\nsurveillance.\nMedium-altitude, inclined-orbit, or synchronous satellites in inclined or geostationary\norbits may be used in this concept. Worldwide coverage requires 24 medium-altitude satellites,\nor 8 to 10 synchronous satellites, and several ground control centers. Many variations on both\napproaches have been studied by different organizations: GE promulgates systems based upon\npulse ranging (ref. 3), whereas RCA (refs. 4 and 5) and Philco (ref. 6 ) champion the cw\ntone-ranging technique. An advantage of cw tone-ranging techniques over pulse ranging is the\ninherent requirement for much lower peak power on both the satellite and the user aircraft.\n\n2.2.2 Passive range differencing.-A passive range-differencing surveillance technique\nhas been postulated by TRW (ref. 7). The TRW system (called NAVSTAR) is basically a\n.\n\n6\n\nnavigation system that can be used for independent ATC surveillance. It consists of a network\nof satellites, using synchronous inclined orbits, and ground stations. (Inclined synchronous orbits permit accurate position fixes from any user aircraft latitude). Each satellite radiates 3\nprecise navigation signal in its own assigned time slot. The satellite signals are accurately synchronized with each other. Hence, a NAVSTAR user can measure range differences between\nranging signals received from separate satellites. If a user aircraft views three satellites simultaneously and its own altitude is known, it can calculate its latitude and longitude (position).\nIf four satellites are in view, the altitude of the user aircraft is not required to determine its\nposition accurately. Thus, hyperbolic radio-navigation is provided.\nFunctionally, each satellite in the NAVSTAR network transmits:\n(1 )\n\nRanging signals\n\n(2)\n\nSatellite data such as identification, time of day, oscillator drift, and\nephemeris (updated periodically from ground control station calculations)\n\nThen, for ATC surveillance applications, a user aircraft:\n(1)\n\nReceives range and satellite data from each satellite\n\n(2)\n\nAutomatically or manually makes onboard computations of its own\nposition\n\n(3)\n\nTransmits position data and user identity via satcom relay to a ground\nstation (ATC)\n\nor, alternately,\n(1)\n\nReceives range and satellite data from each satellite\n\n(2)\n\nAutomatically transmits raw range and satellite data plus user identity\nand altitude to a ground station (ATC) via satellite communications relay\nfor ground computation and display of the user aircraft\xe2\x80\x99s position\n\nThis latter mode is considered more suitable for ATC surveillance of high-speed\naircraft by virtue of aircraft equipment and functional simplicity.\nTwo items in the NAVSTAR system having a major impact on user equipment are:\n\n(1)\n\nThe time-division-multiplexing (TDM) technique used for satellite transmission to the user aircraft from the different satellites in the NAVSTAR\nconstellation\n\n(2)\n\nThe modulation signal design technique for transmission of range information\nto the user aircraft\n\nThe modulation technique selected for use in NAVSTAR to optimally incorporate\ndata transmission with the ranging is the BINOR code in a cw/PCM configuration. This\n\n7\n\nreviewing their data, Boeing generally concurs.\nA summary of the techniques\xe2\x80\x99 relative ratings based upon available data (table 1 )\nshows that active ranging by cw to s is a good choice for the experimental program, whereas active ranging by pulse radar and TRWs (NAVSTAR) rangedifferencing technique are\nreasonable second choices. Insofar as the relative impact upon the airborne terminal is a\nprime consideration, the active pulse-ranging technique can be rejected in favor of the cw tone\nranging technique because of its considerably higher satellite and user-aircraft peak power requirements and airborne equipment complexity. The user-aircraft power requirements for the\nNAVSTAR range-differencing technique appear to be comparable to those for the cw toneranging technique. The critical technology in implementing either of these latter two techniques is low. Both of these multiple-satellite techniques offer the general advantages of stateof-the-art components and in-orbit redundancy.\nHowever, from the standpoint of ATC surveillance requirements, the ultraprecise\nmultiuser fix accuracies inherent in the NAVSTAR technique are considered unnecessary,\nespecially since relatively complex airborne terminal equipment is needed; the ATC operators\nand airlines undoubtedly would be reluctant to support a system having greater capability\nand complexity than can be utilized.\n\n2.4 Conclusions\nIt is apparent from the foregoing considerations that active tone ranging is the ATC\nsurveillance technique most amenable to an experimental SST airborne satellite communication terminal, although NAVSTAR range differencing (surveillance mode) could be used. The\nfinal choice rests with NASA and other government agencies (U\nand foreign) after\n\n8\n\n9\n\n3.0 SURVEILLANCE MODULATION AND LINK ANALYSIS\nTo reduce existing separation standards for the increasing North Atlantic traffic loads\nof the 1 9 7 0 \xe2\x80\x99 ~ ~ the accompanying operational and cost benefits, a surveillance system by\nwith\nwhich the ATC continuously monitors all inflight aircraft is desirable. Use of such a system\npermits separation reductions while maintaining or even lowering presently acceptable collision\nprobabilities. Numerous surveillance schemes are available, involving different numbers of\nsatellites, different modulation methods, and active or passive aircraft usage. A discussion of\nthese various alternates is given in Sec. 2.0. The following are the most attractive candidate\nschemes:\n( 1)\n\nA continuous-tone active-user surveillance system requiring two satellites and\naircraft altimeter measurements whereby the ATC initiates ranging tones that\nare repeated to the ATC center through the satellites by each aircraft upon\nreception of its unique address code\n\n(2)\n\nA BINOR system proposed by TRW in which aircraft navigation is obtained\nwith a four-satellite (or three-satellite and altimeter) passive-user scheme with\nthe user-determined position or timedifference data transmitted, upon interrogation, to the ATC via an additional data link\n\nThe operation, performanbe, and required aircraft terminal implementation of each of\nthese schemes are analyzed in detail in Secs. 3.1,3.2, and 3.3.\n\n3.1 Tone Surveillance System\nThe following analysis considers a continuous-tone active-user surveillance system using\ntwo satellites and aircraft altimeter measurements whereby the ATC center determines aircraft positions by transmitting a continuous multitone signal that is repeated by each aircraft\nin turn upon reception of its unique address code. The tone ranging signal is repeated through\ntwo satellites (of known position) to the ATC, where measurements are made from the signal\ntime delays of the two satellite-to-aircraft ranges. These ranges and the returned aircraft altimeter measurement thus permit a range-range-range (spherical intersection) position determination for the aircraft.\nFor simplest and most reliable system operation, the ATC-initiated ranging signal is\ntransmitted continuously to all aircraft, with the tones being phase-modulated onto an L-band\ncarrier. All aircraft can thus remain continuously locked to the signal, thereby eliminating the\nneed for rapid acquisition for each subsequent surveillance cycle. Furthermore, this forward\nsignal is routed through only one of the two satellites, because transmission back through both\nsatellites to the ATC provides two differently delayed signals for determining the two satellite,\xe2\x80\x99\naircraft ranges. The aircraft must then receive only one incoming surveillance signal and, thus,\nrequires only one transponder. Upon reception of its particular address code, transmitted on\na separate subcarrier that phase-modulates the carrier, an aircraft returns the received tones by\nremodulating them onto a return carrier along with a subcarrier containing a digitized altimeter\nmeasurement and other data. Transmission is then made, for a short (1 second) time period,\nover an aircraft low-gain antenna. Both satellites then repeat the return signal to ATC.\nA diagram of the link-geometry and frequency-band requirements of the tone surveillance scheme is shown in fig. 1. As seen, four separate frequencies are required for system\noperation.\n10\n\n11\n\nLink considerations show desirability\neach satellite. This permits transmission of st\n\nthus permits spectrum conservation through\naircraft links, however, must use a different frequency for each link, because no spatial diversity techniques are used on the satellite or the aircraft. The satellite antenna will provide\nearth coverage or regional coverage (e.g. North Atlantic) and will, therefore, include all airo\ncraft within its beam. Aircraft antennas for surveillance will similarly be broad coverage s\nthat each will cover all satellites.\nOperation of the surveillance system is dependent upon accurate knowledge of satellite\npositions, because uncertainty errors in satellite positions will degrade the accuracy of the aircraft position determination. Since the satellites will be in equatorial synchronous orbits,\nhowever, quite accurate position predictions are possible, particularly on a long-term basis\nwith available data-smoothing techniques. After initial satellite orbit ephemeris is known,\nperiodic updating to determine more accurately the satellite drifts can be performed relatively\ninfrequently, perhaps once daily. To accommodate satellite position determination, it is\nrecommended that both satellites have identical surveillance repeaters so that the initial surveillance signal can be routed through either satellite. In this way, satellite position can be\ndetermined routinely using the existing surveillance signal. This would be accomplished by\nplacing two simple ground terminals at known benchmark locations having surveillance\nequipment identical to that of an aircraft. A similar receiver would be availa\ncenter so that three separate signal paths would exist: from the ATC center\nreturn and from the ATC center via the satellite to each of the two ground 1\nreturn. ATC/satellite range would be determined, and then an address code corresponding\n\n12\n\nDuring the study, a path diversity scheme for overcoming multipath interference in\nits worst-case condition was considered by which the forward surveillance signal is routed\nthrough both satellites. Since use of both satellites for the for\ntinct paths and two slightly different fr\nrougher (and thus better) sea state exis\nin phase) with the\nresulting in less multipath, or (2) one r\ndirect signal whereas the other is interfering destructively. In\ntwo-receiver scheme could be used on the aircraft whereby selection of one or the other\noutput is made from either a stronger signal or an in-lock criterion. Analysis of multipath\ngeometry for the scheme revealed that the strike points for the two signals occur too close\ntogether (typically 50 miles or less) to result in significantly different sea conditions, so that\nsystem improvement would be questionable. If a path diversity scheme is considered, however, it should be noted that routing of the forward signal through both satellites results in\nno significant satellite penalties, because repeater capability will exist in each for routing\nboth forward and return links. If a slightly different center frequency is used for the second\nforward link, a corresponding modification of the second satellite repeater must be made,\npossibly at the expense of a moderately larger bandwidth. At the aircraft, a second\nreceiver and decision/switching device would of course be required, although the general\noperation of the surveillance system would remain unaffected except for selection of the\nbetter received signal at the aircraft.\nThe following sections discuss various aspects of the tone surveillance system:\nSurveillance accuracies, tone-ranging accuracy parameters, ranging error sources, determindtion of ranging tones, satellite repeater description and required bandwidths, and link analysis\nof the forward and return surveillance links.\n3.1.1 Surveillance accuracies.-To determine the required performance and design\nparameters for the tone ranging system, it is first necessary to evaluate parametrically the\nrequired accuracies of the system in terms of the overall surveillance accuracy of aircraft\nposition determination and the ranging accuracy of each range measurement from which\nposition is determined. As described previously, aircraft position is determined from trilateration using three range measurements: the two aircraft-to-satellite ranges and aircraft altitude\nas measured by an onboard altimeter. Inaccuracies in each of these measured ranges, in addition to inaccuracies of satellite positions, result in an overall uncertainty in aircraft position.\nA computer program has been developed to relate all individual inaccuracies to\noverall position inaccuracy for the two-satellite-plus-altimeter (trilateration) scheme under\nconsideration. The program was developed based on a mathematical error determination\nmodel derived by Kulik for the FAA (ref. 8). The program, which calculates overall aircraft\nposition accuracy u p , has the following inputs: (All distance inaccuracies are one-sigma\nvalues expressed in terms of the standard deviation.)\n\n(2)\n\nSatellite 2 nominal position\n\n(3)\n\nAircraft nominal position\n\n(4)\n\nAircraft-to-satellite 1 range inaccuracy U R ~\n\n(5)\n\nAircraft-to-satellite 2 range inaccuracy u R2\n\n13\n\n(6)\n\nAircraft altitude inaccuracy a R 3\n\n(7)\n\nSatellite 1 position inaccuracy relative to\n\n(8)\n\nSatellite 2 position inaccuracy relative to aircraft\n\n(9)\n\nCenter-of-the-earth position inaccuracy relative to aircraft us3\n\nus2\n\nIn the normal program mode, the overall aircraft position accuracy ap is in the\nform of a graphical error isogram showing accuracy as a function of aircraft position\n(latitude and longitude). Results show increased accuracy degradation as the aircraft\napproaches nearer to the equator or as the aircraft moves farther away in longitude from a\npoint midway between the two satellites. For purposes of studying the tone scheme for the\nNorth Atlantic area, accuracy data were developed for a worst-case aircraft position in the\nNorth Atlantic quadrant (a lower corner of the coverage area). A position at 40"N, 70"W\nis thus chosen, and u p is plotted in fig. 2 versus the required aircraft-to-satellite range\nmeasurement accuracies UR 1 and U R ~ various aircraft altimeter accuracies Q R3 .\nfor\nSatellite positions are chosen at nominal longitudes of l0"W and 50\xc2\xb0W,\napproximately\ncentered on the North Atlantic quadrant. Since surveillance accuracy is relatively insensitive to longitudinal satellite separation, a somewhat narrow 40" separation is chosen to\npermit a broad coverage area (the entire North Atlantic area) within sight of both satellites.\nUncertainties in satellite positions are also assumed conservatively: a 300-foot uncertainty in\neach satellite position with respect to the aircraft r~ 31 and u s 2 and a zero-foot uncertainty\nin center-of-earth position as3. Aircraft-to-satellite range inaccuracies U ~1 and Q R2 are\nassumed in the graph to be equai, because the same tone ranging system is used for each\nmeasurement.\nAs seen in fig. 2, surveillance accuracy is not particularly sensitive to altimeter\naccuracy U R3 for the aircraft position chosen, .which was selected to represent the worstcase overall accuracy for the coverage area. The effect of OR3 is more significant, however,\nfor aircraft locations in the center of the coverage area or nearer to the equator. As\ndetermined from the traffic analysis in Sec. 6.2 of vol. 11, an overall surveillance system\naccuracy of 1 n.mi. is required, corresponding to a ranging accuracy (from fig. 2) of 3600 feet\nfor the satellite-to-aircraft range. The tone surveillance system can thus be designed to\nprovide this accuracy on each link. The 3600-foot accuracy is comprised of all the error\nsources of the ranging link, as discussed in the error analysis of Sec. 3.1.3. The prime error\nsource, however, is the measurement accuracy of the tones; this is discussed in the following\nsection.\n3.1.2 Tone ranging accuracy parameters.-The following discussion presents\nparametric data relating the various characteristics of a multiple-tone ranging system to\n- _ _\nranging accuracy. The various relationships existing among tone frequency, available\nsignal-to-noise ratio (S/N) in the tone channels, tone measurement accuracy, and overall\nlink ranging errors due to noise in the tone channels are considered.\nThe root-mean-square (rms) accuracy Qrms to which the phase of a continuous\nranging tone can be measured is determined by the following expression (ref. 9):\nurms (radians) =\n\n14\n\n/m\n\nSIN > 10\n\n1.75\n\n1.50\n\n.-\n\nE\'\nr\'\n\nb 1.25\na\n\ns\n0\nE\n\na\nm\nE\nc\n\n0\n\nz 1.0r\nQ\n\n0\n\n6\n.Q\n\n2\n\nI\n\n.\n+4\nc\n\nE\n2\nB\n\n0.7E\n\n05\n.C\n\n0.21\n\nFIGURE 2- SUR VEILLAI\n.\n\n15\n\nwhere S/N is the numerical signal-to-noise ratio in the tone measurement loop.

The expression is shown graphically in fig. 4, where a~ is plotted in\nfeet as a function of ft for various values of a r m s . As an example of usage of this graph,\nit is seen that a 10 000-Hz tone measured to an accuracy of 0.4 radians permits a ranging\naccuracy UN of about 3 100 feet.\nEquations (1) and (2) can be combined in a more useful form to relate ranging\naccuracy to tone frequency and tone S/N. This results in the graph of fig. 5, where required\ntone S/N can be found as a function of tone frequency for a required ranging accuracy\na~ . For example, a 5000-Hz tone to provide a 2000-foot ranging accuracy requires a\nSIN of 15 dB.\nThe expressions presented are, of course, theoretical best-case representation. To\napply these expressions to the ranging link design discussed in Sec. 3.1.4, more conservative\nvalues are chosen as warranted. Other error sources, in addition to the tone measurement\naccuracy, are discussed in Sec. 3.1.3.\n3.1.3 Ranging error sources. - As seen from fig. 2, a required ranging accuracy for\nthe aircraft-to-satellite range measurement a~ can be determined to provide a particular\noverall surveillance accuracy crp required to support a given separation sfandard. The\nindividual ranging accuracy can then be analyzed in terms of an error budget based on the\nvarious error sources inherent to the ranging process. The errors are due to six factors:\n(1) tone measurement accuracy, which is discussed in Sec. 3.1.2; (2) propagation effects of\nrefraction and path delay; (3) multipath interference; (4)oscillator instabilities; ( 5 ) equipment time delays; and ( 6 ) speed-of-light uncertainty. These errors manifest both bias and\nrandom characteristics, so that error reduction is possible in some cases, if d\nprediction.\nThe effects of tone measurement accuracy upon ranging accuracy are\nupon the resultant S/N in each tone channel at ,the ATC center.

Detailed propagation analysis (summarized in table 16,\nSec. 6.3) provides these errors from worst-case conditions. Since the ranging signal must\ntravel through four links in the ranging process (from ATC to satellite to aircraft and return)\npropagation errors are additive over the total path.\nTable 2 summarizes the worst-case propagation errors for an elevation angle of\n12.4", the minimum for a New York-to-London route, as analyzed in Sec. 6.0.\nFor a subsonic aircraft, tropospheric group delay would be slightly greater for the\nsatellite-to-aircraft links, because a larger portion of the troposphere would be above the\naircraft. The SST is above most of the troposphere during cruise. The propagation errors\nare moderately predictive, because they are strong functions of ( 1) ionosphere state,\nwhich is readily available from sunspot number predictions or regular atmospheric measurements, and (2) elevation angles, which are available from computations of system geometry.\nHowever, because atmospheric error is not particularly large in relation to noise error in the\nsystem, it is simply considered a random error and na effort will be made to subtract its\nbias by prediction.\nMultipath phenomena degrade the tone system performance by producing destructive\nsignal interference (fading) with the direct signal and by causing phase distortion in the\nvarious tones from the random, diffuse components of reflected energy. The problem\narises only on links between the satellite and aircraft, where sea conditions may bring about\nstrong reflections. Treatment of the signal fading condition is made by providing a multipath fading margin in the link analysis where necessary. The fading margin is chosen to\nprovide a sufficient increase in direct signal strength to overcome fading effects for a\nspecific portion of time, considering also the effects of inherent antenna discrimination\nagainst the reflected signal. Detailed multipath analysis is presented in Sec. 6.2.3, where\nfading margin is determined for worst-case sea conditions. The effects of phase distortion\nwill be minor in the tone channels since overall required accuracy (1 n.mi.) for surveillance\nin the operational system is relatively coarse in comparison. Range errors due to phase\ndistortion of several hundred feet maximum are anticipated on each of the two links where\nmultipath occurs. For purposes of analysis, a total error of 500 feet is assumed, which\nshould be conservative for the tone scheme chosen.\nRange error due to oscillator instability will be directly affected only by the ATC\nmaster oscillator, from which the carrier frequency and all initial ranging tones are generated,\nbecause a coherent turnaround system is proposed aboard the aircraft. Other free-running\noscillators at the satellites contribute only to the RF frequency uncertainty, which is\ntracked out by the A\nr tracking loop. To ensure good stability on the initial\ncarrier, it is expected\nh-stability oscillator will be present at the ATC, so that\nranging error due to short-term oscillator drift is negligible. Instabilities on the order of\nflO-9 long-term are feasible for the ATC master clock, with somewhat better stability\nexisting over the short term of the less than 1 second it takes the transmitted tones to travel to\nthe aircraft via satellite and back. For 210-9 instability over a typical delay time, a\n10-kHz tone would be subject to an error of f l 0 - 5 Hz,which is far below the phase measurement accuracy and is thus negligible. Over the short term, such jitter caused by oscillator\ninstability is basically random.\n20\n\nTABLE 2. -PROPAGATION ERRORS\nIonospheric\ngroup delay,\nft\n\nTropospheric\ngroup delay,\nft\n\nCombined\nbending\ndelay,\nft\n\nTotal\nerror,\nft\n\nATC to satellite\n\n39.7\n\n30.7\n\n183.7\n\n254\n\nSat to aircraft*\n\n39.7\n\n0.98\n\n150.0\n\n191\n\nAircraft to satellite 39.7\n\n0.98\n\n150.0\n\n191\n\n183.7\n\n254\n\nLink\n\nSatellite to ATC\n\n39.7\n\n30.7\n\n890\nI\n\n*SST aircraft a t 70 000-ft cruise altitude\n\n21\n\nEquipment time delays arise whenever the ranging signal tones pass through a\nrepeater or transponder in the path to the aircraft and return. In particular, filtering\noperations at baseband are significant because of inherent phase delays in the circuitry.\nBecause these slight delays are interpreted in the range computation as resulting from a\nlonger transmission path, an associated range error exists for each delay. Delays are present\nin the following equipment; they are presented in the order in which the signal is routed\nthrough the system: (1) ATC transmitter delay, (2) satellite repeater delay, (3) aircraft\ntransponder delay, (4)satellite repeater delay, and (5) ATC receiver delay.\nNominal values of time delay through each equipment will be determined from an\ninitial design analysis and prototype measurements, so that they can be subtracted out of\nthe overall time delay during ranging. The uncertainty in equipment time delays is\nsignificant, however, since filter center frequencies and phase delays vary as a function of\nenvironment, aging, and quality control. This uncertainty, treated as normally distributed,\nthus contributes to ranging error.\nThe effects of equipment-delay uncertainty are greatest at the aircraft transponder\nand the ATC receiver, where baseband filtering is performed. At the ATC transmitter and\nsatellite repeaters, where all filtering is performed at IF or above, delay uncertainties are\nnegligible in comparison. Uncertainty in time delay, due primarily to filtering operations,\nis conservatively estimated to be at most 2 p e c through the system. An equipment design\ngoal corresponding to this uncertainty is postulated for development of the hardware. The\ncorresponding range error is thus 1970 feet.\nSpeed-of-light uncertainty will also affect system ranging accuracy because an\nuncertainty of 2300 meters/second (f0.161 n.mi./second) exists for this constant (ref.11).\nThe error thus represents a bias; it, of course, cannot be compensated for because its actual\nvalue is unknown. Since the ranging measurement is based on a maximum path length of\n87 200 n.mi. from the ATC to the satellite to the aircraft and return, with a nominal propagation time of 0.54 second, the corresponding uncertainty is f0.0875 n.mi., or f532 feet.\nThe error will simply be treated as random in the total system error budget.\nThe following error factors can now be itemized for the random error sources of\nthe system:\nTone measurement accuracy\n\n................\n\n=N\n\n.......................\n\n890 feet\n\n.............................\n.Oscillator instability. ......................\n\n500 feet\n\nAtmospheric errors\nMultipath..\n\n....................\n.......................\n\nnegligible\n\nEquipment time delays\n\n1970 feet\n\nSpeed-of-light error\n\n532 feet\n\nSince the error sources are treated as random, the total ranging error O R can be obtained\nas the root sum of the squares (rss) of the individual sources. The ranging-system design\napproach is to begin with the total ranging error UR (found from fig. 2) required to\nsatisfy a particular surveillance accuracy up . The allowable tone-measurement-accuracy\nerror is then determined from an rss calculation of the remaining error sources. For the\n\n22\n\nrequired surveillance accuracy of 1 n.mi., therefore, a ranging accuracy U R of\nis required (fig. 2). The rss of all ranging errors must then be less than 3600 feet.

The ranging links will thus be designed to provide this tonemeasurement accuracy of 2785 feet or less.\n\n3.1.4 Surveillance tone determination. - Determination of the number of tones,\ntone frequencies, and tone measurement accuracies required for the surveillance system is\ndependent upon the required ranging accuracy ,ranging link performance and available\nbandwidth, and geometry of the aircraft positions within the surveillance system. These\nfactors and how they affect determination of tones are discussed in the following.\nThe basic tone scheme is one in which phase-difference measurements are made at\nthe ATC center between the transmitted and returned tones repeated at the aircraft. Each\ntone phase difference then provides a range accuracy; the highest tone provides the overall,\nfine ranging accuracy, and each lower tone in turn resolves the range ambiguity of the next\nhigher tone. After carrier acquisition is achieved at the ATC center, the tones are extracted\nfrom the signal baseband and tracked in narrowband phase-tracking loops. Narrowband\ntone tracking is possible, because the received signal frequency uncertainty is tracked out\nin the carrier loop, leaving only minor uncertainty in each tone frequency at baseband. The\noutput of each tone loop, which has a small phase error dependent on input tone S/N, is\nthen compared in phase with the continuous transmitted tone. Since only the phase\ndifference corresponding to the satellite/aircraft range is desired, known time delays in the\nranging system are subtracted out during computation to result in the phase difference for\nthe unknown (satellite/aircraft) range.\nIn a multiple-tone ranging system, the lowest tone must be of sufficiently low\nfrequency to resolve the inherent range ambiguity of the system. This range ambiguity\narises from the time difference in responses from an aircraft at the minimum distance from\nthe satellite and one at the maximum distance. Since, in the worst extreme, the approximate position of an aircraft may not be known until surveillance is accomplished, it is\ndesirable to have both the earliest and latest possible response delays fall within the same\ncycle of the lowest tone. This will enable determination of unique aircraft position as the\nlowest tone is measured. In this way, no position ambiguity will result, as would be the\ncase for a higher tone where a certain phase measurement might correspond to any of\nseveral possible aircraft/satellite ranges.\nThe minimum aircraft/satellite range will be about 19 300 n.mi. for an SST aircraft\nat a 12 n.mi. altitude directly beneath a satellite. A maximum range of 2 1 800 n.mi. will\nat the farthest edge\narea, where the satellite appears at\n10 above the horiz\nbetween the nearest and farthest satellites can thus be as great as 2500\nThe maximum\ndifference in path lengths between the nearest and farthest aircraft for two-way ranging from\nthe ATC center is double this distance, or 5000 n.mi., however, because the ranging path\nludes the aircraft/satellite\nO\n\n23\n\nsome a priori knowledge of aircraft position, to use a reduced ambiguity range for the tone\nsystem-by\npermitting a higher basic frequency. The performance advantages of this\nscheme are slight, however, so that the chosen lower frequency appears to be the most\nflexible and realistic choice.\nThe remaining frequencies must now be chosen at specific multiples above the\nlowest frequency to provide finer accuracies. The following constraints apply for tone\nselection.\n(1)\n\nSince the RF surveillance signal must pass through a bandpass repeater at\nthe satellites, a minimum RF signal bandwidth is desirable to improve link\nperformance. This is accomplished by using as low a frequency as is feasible\nfor the highest tone frequency.\n\n(2)\n\nSince link performance is dependent upon both number of tones and tone\nS/N, it is desirable to minimize as much as possible both the number of\ntones and the accuracy to which they are measured (permitting a low S/N).\nBecause it is recognized that these two goals are conflicting, an optimum\nbalance between the two for best link performance should be realized.\n\n(3)\n\nTones should be related by simple multiples to permit implementation of a\nsimple, coherent tone scheme and to simplify tone generation from a single\nclock source.\n\nIt would be theoretically possible to minimize the number of tones by providing\ngood tone S/N for measuring each to a high accuracy. Such a scheme, employing phase\nmeasurements accurate to several degrees, would then permit tone multiples to about 100,\nand thus result in a system employing perhaps three tones for obtaining the required\nranging accuracy. The present design consensus, however, appears to favor smaller tone\nmultiples on the order of 10 or less, because design difficulties arise with higher multiples\ndue to the exacting receiver design tolerances necessary to measure phase difference to\ngreat accuracies. Ranging tones will thus be chosen to be related by coherent multiples of\nfour or five, and sufficient S/N will be provided in each tone loop to provide more than\nadequate phase accuracy for resolving the next higher tone. In this way, possible bias\neffects of the tone loops, adding further phase error, will be compensated for in the design.\nThus, whereas a tone multiple of five would require measuring the lower tone to only 115 of\na cycle (72"), necessitating only a low SIN for measurement, a more accurate measurement\nto 10"or 20" will provide substantial design margin to accommodate tone filter bias errors.\nAs seen in fig. 3, a tone S/N of 10 dB in the loop will permit phase measurement to 13".\nThis S/N value will be used in the analysis.\nA detailed link analysis for the tone system will be performed using a representative\nsurveillance system that provides a surveillance accuracy of 1 n.mi. As determined, such a\nsystem req\n1 ranging accuracy of 3600 feet and, from the error discussion of\nSec. 3.1.3,\nement accuracy of 2785 feet.\nIt is now possible to determine a tone scheme for such a system by using tone S/N\'s\nof 10 dB, a lowest tone of about 30 Hz, and tone multiples of 4 or 5.

For the satellite to which the\ncontinuous ATC-originated forward surveillance signal is sent, two signals will be present:\nthe forward signal and the returned aircraft response.

It is similarly assumed for the analytical purposes of this study that the\nsurveillance repeater is independent of the voice repeater through final amplification,\nexcept for the use of a common LO source. This decision is based on the different natures\nof the surveillance and voice functions, because the presence of multiple signals of varying\nlevels in a repeater can cause severe intermodulation and suppression effects. The random\npresence of voice signals in the same repeater with the surveillance signals would complicate\nthe system design in addition to degrading the performance of both types of links. Similarly,\npossibility exists that the voice links will be routed through only one satellite or have\nunequal loading through each satellite, thus making an integrated surveillance/voice\nrepeater inefficient.\nThe design of the frequency-translation surveillance repeater is assumed to have\ncommon final rf power amplification for both forward and return surveillance signals, but\nseparate i.f. channels for each (fig. 6). The reasons for this selection are as follows. It is\ndesirable from the standpoint of repeater simplicity to put both signals through the same\npower amplifier if possible, particularly since the required powers of the two signals are\ngreatly different. The forward link requires on the order of 20 times the output power\nrequired by the return link, so that a common amplifier can readily meet the needs of both,\nwith the return signal drawing off only a small portion of the total power. This approach\nment for a separate return link implementation to obtain less than a watt\nr a separate rf amplifier or additional i.f. amplification and\nthe relative levels of the two signals into the power amplifier,\noccurs in the desired proportion, separate i.f. stages are\neve1 control is not possible using a single i.f. stage to pass\nthe signal strengths received at the satellite will vary too widely. The\nard signal can be controlled to a specific level at the satellite, but the\nreturn signals from the various aircraft will fluctuate, primarily from differences in path\nlosses and in aircraft antenna gains due to aircraft orientation. The variation in received\npowers would further compound the situation if both signals were passed through the hard\nlimiter of a single i f . stage, since degradation and intermodulation effects would make the\nrelative signals levels vary further. For these reasons, each received signal is passed through\n\n25\n\nm\nc\nc\nm\nr\n0\nE\n\ni2\n3\n\nrn\nII\n\nN\nC\n\nrn\n\nP\n\nS\n\nrn\n\n26\n\n(\nu\n\nS\n\nrn\n\nc\n\nE\n\nrn\n\na separate i.f. stage. As shown in fig. 6,-both received rf signals are mixed down to i.f.\nafter previous amplification and are then filtered into separate channels where hard limiting\nand subsequent variable-gain amplification are performed to provide the desired amplitude\nfor each signal. The signals are then summed, raised to downlink rf, bandpass filtered to\neliminate the undesired components from the up-conversion process, and then power\namplified. Suppression and degradation effects for two signals passing through a soft\nlimiter (such as a saturated power amplifier) have been analyzed by Sevy in ref. 12. In this\nreference, it is shown that a maximum level suppression of 4.5 dB occurs through a soft\nlimiter for the weaker signal. To obtain power division as required in the power amplifier,\ntherefore, this additional power in the return signal must be provided by i.f. amplification.\nThe power amplifier, operating in a saturated mode, will introduce limiting effects\non the two signals that will result in enhancement of the stronger signal, suppression of the\nweaker one, and generation of intermodulation (IM) crosstalk products. These effects can\nbe compensated for at the i.f. level, however, by providing the proper signal levels to offset\nthe level change caused by the limiting and by providing a guardband of sufficient bandwidth to minimize IM products. In addition, the limiting effect will cause S/N enhancement\nor suppression in each of the two channels, which must also be considered in the link\ndesign.\nIf only one surveillance signal is present at the satellite, the full amplifier power\nwould be provided to the one signal. This can be readily implemented by sensing the\npresence of each signal prior to i.f. limiting and providing an input to the signal summer\nonly if a signal is sensed. In this way, noise will not be put into the power amplifier in\nthe absence of a signal. This is particularly important if no forward signal is present at the\nsatellite, because noise-only transmission if permitted would interfere with the reception\nof the forward signal (from the other satellite) at the aircraft.\nThe required bandwidths for the surveillance system can also be seen in fig. 6 .\nIn each i.f. channel, the filter noise bandwidths Bn must be wide enough to pass the\nsurveillance signal bandwidth BSUN, the frequency uncertainty of the received surveillance\nsignal at the satellite ( A frec), the frequency uncertainty at i.f. due to the satellite repeater\nLO instability A frep i.f. ,and bandwidth margin to account for center frequency drift and\nbandwidth change due to temperature and aging effects for assumed crystal filters. The\ntotal required spectrum bandwidth at rf after upconversion to the downlink rf is the sum\nof both surveillance signal bandwidths, both surveillance signal frequency uncertainties, a\nguardband to minimize IM interference between the two signals in the saturated power\namplifier, the frequency uncertainty at rf due to the repeater LO, and bandwidth margins\nfor the i.f. filters. The veriocs bandwidths and frequency uncertainty components are\ndiscussed in the following pal !graphs.\nThe frequency uncertainty due to repeater LO instability is significantly greater at\ni.f. than at rf. This occurs because the uncertainty at i.f. is mostly canceled out upon final\nmixing up to downlink rf. Since the i.f. is very much lower than the rf, the LO frequency\ntimes M approaches the incoming rf (fin) . Repeater frequency undertainty at i.f. is thus\n\nx fin\n\n-\n\nLO instability\n\n(5)\n\n27\n\nThe worst-case uncertainty occurs for the maximum fin, or 1660 MHz, so that for a\ntypical assumed LO long-term instability of +lo-6, frequency uncertainty at i.f. is 2 1660 Hz.\nRepeater frequency uncertainty at rf, after up-conversion, is expressed as\nAfrep r f = (M - N)fLo\n= (fin - fout)\n\n-\n\nLO instability\nLO instability\n\nsince (M - N)fLO is the frequency translation from the input to the output rf. For an\nfout of 1560 MHz and the values above, frequency uncertainty at rf is k 100 Hz.\nAdded i.f. bandwidth A ffil must be provided to account for filter instabilities in\nthe assumed crystal filters in the i.f. channels. The added bandwidth provides for both\ncenter-frequency drift and bandwidth sensitivity due to aging and temperature effects. For\ncenter-frequency drift, +900 Hz is provided, assuming a realizable 30 ppm (parts per million)\nstability for crystal filters and a maximum i.f. frequency of about 30 MHz. An additional\n10%factor is added to account for possible bandwidth expansion due to temperature\nchange over the normal satellite environment range.\nThe surveillance signal rf bandwidth BSu, for the continuous multiple-tone\nscheme under consideration, in which the L-band carrier is phase-modulated by the several\ntones, is twice the highest tone frequency, because only the first sidebands of all tone and\ndata subcarriers will be utilized in the demodulation process. For the five-tone scheme\nconsidered, Bsuw is 20 kHz. It is assumed that the data subcarrier, on which the aircraft\naddress code is transmitted in the forward link and the digitized aircraft altimeter measurement transmitted in the return link, will be of sufficiently low frequency to permit placement closer to the carrier than the highest tone frequency but still high enough to be outside\nthe frequency uncertainty of the carrier so that false lock-on does not become a problem.\nSince a data rate of only about 55 bits per second (bps) is anticipated, this placement\npresents no problem. It is also convenient to place all tones clustered below the highest\ntone (fig. 7). This scheme, using difference tones between the actual tones and the highest\ntone, aids the tone turnaround procedure at the aircraft by permitting simpler tone\nfiltering. In addition, clustering of the tones leaves the region nearer the carrier available\nfor placement of the data subcarrier. Upon reception at the ATC center, simple mixing of\nthe difference tones with the highest tone after tone tracking will restore the original lower\ntones for difference measurements.\nFrequency uncertainty effects on the surveillance system are now considered. In\ndetermining these various uncertainties, several assumptions are made concerning system\noperation and geometry:\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\n28\n\nA very stable reference oscillator will exist at the ATC center as a frequency\nreference in generating all initial surveillance and voice link carriers.

This coherent mode of operation\ngreatly simplifies subsequent acquisition at the ATC center (as discussed in\nSec. 3.1.6.2) because preliminary knowledge of the aircraft position and\nbearing permits doppler prediction and thus simplified, accurate, narrowband\ncarrier acquisition at the ATC receiver. However, a coherent mode of\noperation does increase frequency uncertainty, requiring a slightly greater\nbandwidth at the satellite repeater to accommodate the increase. The\n,\ndifference in uncertainty arises because coherent operation includes the\neffects of the two-way satellite/aircraft doppler, whereas return-carrier\ngeneration by an onboard LO results in only a one-way doppler shift in\naddition to oscillator instability drift, which for typical long-term oscillator\ninstabilities (e.g. +_ 10-6 for commercial aircraft communications equipment)\nis significantly lower than maximum doppler shift (approximately k 1600 Hz\nversus +4500 Hz).\n\nWorst-case frequency uncertainty effects are presented in table 3 for the four links\nof the surveillance system (fig. 1).\nPlacement of the surveillance uplinks and downlinks in the L-band is assumed consistent with proposed allocations of satellite L-band voice and surveillance communications\nlinks according to the FAA recommendations detailed in ref. 13. The recommendations\nprovide for the use of the 1640- to 1660-MHz band for uplinks and the 1540- to 1560-MHz\nband for downlinks. Doppler shift, the major contributor to frequency uncertainty in the\nbandwidth, is maximum when the transmit frequencies are at the upper end of each band,\ni.e. at 1560 MHz and 1660 MHz. For doppler calculations, an SST aircraft is assumed that is\nexpected to cruise at Mach 2.7 at an altitude of 70 000 feet, corresponding to a velocity of\n0.43 n.mi. per second. Worst-case doppler shifts are calculated for an SST directly in line\nwith the satellite, where the satellite is at a 10" elevation angle.\nThe frequency translation of the satellite repeater corresponding to frequencies\nat the upper part of each band is then 100 MHz (1660 MHz minus 1560 MHz), and the\ncoherent multiplication factor at the aircraft transponder is about 1.064 (1 660 MHz/ 1560 MHz)\nfor generating the return-link carrier. Frequency-translation uncertainty is then calculated\nfor a satellite repeater LO long-term instability of 2 10-6.\nThe required i f . bandwidths Bn in the repeater can now be determined. In the\nthe received\nforward link i f . channel, the noise bandwidth Bnl is the sum of Bsu,,\nsignal frequency uncertainty (seen from table 3 to be negligible), the repeater i.f. frequency\nuncertainty {found in eq.

(6), which is already included in the return link\nfrequency uncertainty), the filter bandwidth margins, and a guardband between the forward\nand return-link signals. The guardband is provided to minimize the effects of the odd-order\nIM products resulting from the two surveillance signals passing through the saturated power\namplifier. Since only two signals are present, it is possible to space the signals to eliminate\nall crosstalk in the channels due to IM terms. It is thus assumed that a guardband equal to\nthe 20-kHz bandwidth of each surveillance signal Bsum is provided between the two\nchannels to elhinate crosstalk. This assumption is supported by Sevy (ref. 12), whose\nanalysis shows that for two FM signals all crosstalk in the band can be eliminated if the\nchannel center frequencies are separated by twice the channel bandwidth.\nThe total spectrum bandwidth is calculated to be 88.0 kHz. This bandwidth is the\nrequired spectrum allocation for the surveillance channels in the L-band system, since no\nfurther frequency uncertainty is added between the satellite and the ATC. The spectrum\nbandwidth would be required in both the uplink (1640 to 1660 MHz) and downlink\n(1540 to 1560 MHz) bands.\n3.1.6 Link analysis. - Analysis of surveillance link performance for the multiple-tone\nscheme is made with detailed worst-case link analyses for the four surveillance links shown\nin fig. 1. From the link analysis, all significant performance results are graphed parametrically\nfor subsequent trade analyses. As discussed previously, system operation involves a satellite\nrepeater translating one or two received signals to the lower downlink frequency band. For\nthe analysis, the worst-case situation with two signals present at the satellite is considered.\nThe ranging signal is initiated with continuous transmission from ATC, and the forward\nsignal is relayed to all aircraft by the satellite repeater. At each aircraft receiver, the downlink carrier is tracked coherently, the data subcarrier is demodulated, and the received\naddress codes are monitored and compared to the aircraft address code. When the correct\ncode is transmitted, an aircraft response is initiated wherein the uplink carrier is generated\nby coherent multiplication of the received carrier. The carrier is phase modulated by:\n(1) a data subcarrier modulated with the aircraft address code, a digitized aircraft altimeter\nmeasurement, and other data; and by (2) the ranging tones, which are envelope filtered out\nof the received baseband and retransmitted on the return carrier. At the satellite, the\nreturn signal is repeated to ATC, where the carrier is acquired, coherently tracked, and\ndemodulated to obtain the aircraft altimeter measurement and the ranging tone baseband.\nThe tones are subsequently tracked in tone loops and measured for phase difference with\nthe ATC-generated tones.\n\n32\n\nFor preliminary analysis, a five-tone scheme is considered (as described in Sec. 3.1.3)\nhaving tone frequencies of 3 1.25, 125,s-00,2000, and 10 000 Hz. These tone frequencies\nprovide the required surveillance accuracy of 1 a m i . The tone selection results in an rf\nsurveillance bandwidth BsuW of 20 kHz for each surveillance signal and satellite repeater\nnoise bandwidths of 27.6 and 47.0 kHz for the uplink and downlink frequency bands, as shown\nin eqs. (7) and (8). The satellite repeater is thus designed to accommodate the two channels;\nboth forward and return surveillance links can be accommodated if present at the satellite.\nThe specific link analysis entries are itemized and justified in app. A. A detailed\ndiscussion of the analysis and resultant link performance is presented in the following\nsections.\n\n3.1.6.I Forward path, A TC to aircraft: The surveillance link forward path from the\nATC to the aircraft includes the ATC-to-satellite and satellite-to-aircraft links. It is apparent\nthat the downlink from the satellite to the aircraft is the more critical link because of constraints upon satellite transmitter power and aircraft receiving antenna gain. In contrast, the\nuplink is not limited because ATC transmitter power and transmitting antenna gain are\navailable as required. Because the downlink performance with a satellite repeater will be\ndependent upon that of the uplink (namely, upon the output S/N of the forward signal from\nthe repeater), it is necessary that a strong S/N exist at the repeater in order to minimize the\ndownlink noise degradation effects. It is thus necessary for the ATC to provide in the\nsatellite a relatively clean surveillance signal.\nThe S/N required at the repeater power amplifier output must be determined and,\nfrom this value, the ATC transmitter power required to provide this S/N derived. Similarly,\nthe effects of the repeater if.\nlimiter and power amplifier upon the forward signal must be\nconsidered when both forward and return signals, at different levels, are present.\nThe degradation on the downlink is due to the additive link noise injected at the satellite repeater. This transmitted additive noise both consumes satellite transmitter power and\nadds to the receiver noise at the aircraft. Since the downlink to the aircraft is power limited,\nwhereas the uplink from ATC is not, sufficient S/N will be provided by the uplink to result\nin only a small subsequent increase (several tenths of a dB) in satellite transmitter power to\novercome repeater degradation effects. The relationship between.repeater output S/N in the\nforward signal rf noise bandwidth Bn1 of 27.6 kHz, S/NI, and the required satellite\npower can be shown from considering the two degradation effects due to transmitted noise:\nsignal power degradation and aircraft receiver noise degradation. The definitions of all\nbandwidths, S/N\xe2\x80\x99s, and additive noise degradation effects for the satellite-to-aircraft link\nare shown in fig. 8.\nSignal power degradation D1, the proportion of signal power to total power\ntransmitted in the forward signal bandwidth, is given by\n\nD1--- s\nS+N1\n\n-\n\n1\n\n1+N1/S\n\n(9)\n\nwhere S/N1 is the signal-to-noise ratio in Bn at the satellite power amplifier output. This\nexpression is shown graphically in dB in fig. 9.\n\n33\n\nt\n\ni\nI\n\n3-\n\ni\n\nt\n\na\n\nS\n.-\n\nI\n\n34\n\nE\n\nS\n..-\n\nS\n\na\n\nE\n.-\n\nc\n\nJ\n\n0\n\nE\n-\n\nI-\n\n-\n\nh\n\nQ\nkl\n\nL\n\nY\n0\nP\nQ\n\n?!\nh\n\n35\n\nAs seen, a degradation o f zero dB is approached for a high S/N 1, whereas the\nexpression is approximated by S/N 1 for a very low S/N 1 (S/N 1 < -1 0 dB). For the case\nunder consideration, where S/N1 is positive, degradation will be slight. It should be noted\nthat the return channel is also present in the repeater and receives a portion of power\namplifier power according to the preset signal-to-signal ratio into the power amplifier.\nSignal power degradation D1 is expressed in terms of the total power in the Bn bandwidth\nunder consideration, which is itself only a portion of total amplifier power.\nReceiver noise degradation D2 is caused by the transmitted downlink noise N1\nadding to the inherent receiver noise N2 , as shown in fig. 8. Since N1 is distributed over\nthe bandwidth Bn, only that portion in Bsum or Nl(BsuW/Bn) will produce interference. Since both noise components are gaussian, they add linearly at the receiver to\nyield an effective S/N of S/[N1(Bsu,/Bn) + N2] in the surveillance bandwidth Bsurv.\nWithout downlink noise, S/N at the receiver would be S/N2, so that the degradation\ncaused by additive noise can be expressed as the ratio of S/N\'s of the additive to the\nnonadditive case:\n\nIt is desirable, however, to express D2 in terms of S/N 1 and the required carrierto-total-noise ratio at the receiver C/Nt, because these parameters are more descriptive of\nthe link. It must be kept in mind that the required C/Nt is defined in the surveillance\nsignal bandwidth BSUw, which is 20 kHz for the case considered. However, S/N1 is\ndefined with respect to the RF noise bandwidth Bn, which is 27.6 kHz for the forwardlink case.\nFor adequate link performance, received signal power at the aircraft S must be\ngreater than or equal to the product of total noise power and threshold ClNt in Bsup,:\n\nNt, in BSUN, is the sum of N1-Bsu,\nBn\n\nand N2, so that\n\nfrom which\n\nN1\n\n36\n\n\'\n\n[ +(?)

For the forward surveillance link, Bnl is 27.6 kHz (+44.4 dB-Hz) and C/@ , as\ndefined in a subsequent section, is +36.2 dB-Hz. Therefore, C/+Bn is -8.2 dB. It should\nbe noted that D2 is plotted for the worst-case (threshold) situation, where degradation is\nmaximum. For operation above threshold, receiver noise is lower with respect received noise\nso that D2 from eq. (10) is reduced.\nThe two degradation factors are now combined in fig. 11, showing worst-case\n(threshold) total degradation as a function of S/N 1. This total degradation is in effect the\nincrease in satellite transmitter power required to overcome the combined noise degradations\nin the downlink. Due to the high premium on available transmitter power at the satellite,\nan increase in transmitter power of 0.3 dB due to noise degradation will be assumed tolerable. For the forward surveillance link, where C/@Bn is -8.2 dB, this corresponds to a\nrequired S/N1 of +12.0 dB, as seen from fig. 11. The two degradations are then seen to be\n0.3 dB for D1 (fig. 9) and zero dB for D2 (fig. 10).\nThe performance of the two forward-path links can now be determined, as shown in\ntable 4,for the required S/N1 of +12.0 dB at the repeater power amplifier output. The\nuplink is considered first.\n37\n\nSatellite repeater output signal-to-noise ratio in B,, S/N1, dB\n\nFIGURE 10.- RECEIVER NOISE DEGRADA TION DUE TO TRANSMITTED NOISE (D2)\n\n38\n\nSatellite repeater output signal-to-noise ratio in Bn, S/Nl, dB\n\nFIGURE 77.-\n\nCOMBINED DEGRADATIONS DU\xe2\x82\xac TO TRANSMITTED NOISE ( D l + D21\n\n.\n\n.\n\n39\n\nTABLE 4. - MULTIPLE-TONE SURVEILLANCE LINK ANALYSIS: FORWARD LINK\nATC\nValue\n\nParameter\n1.

The choice\nof a regional-cove\nvoice link analysis in Sec. 8.0. The\nrepeater i.f. noise\nd-link i.f. channel is 27.6 kHz (44.4 dB-Hz),\nas found from eq. (7). A further discussion of link-analysis entries is given in app. A.\nSince both forward and return signals are passed through the saturated power\namplifier, a soft limiting effect will exist, with the weaker signal being suppressed further\nin relation to the stronger and S/N enhancement or degradation of each signal. For the\ntone surveillance case, the forward signal is the stronger since adequate S/N is required in\nthe repeater to minimize downlink degradation effects. The return signal, on the other hand\nhas somewhat poorer S/N, because the downlink from the satellite to the ATC center can\ntolerate moderate degradation due to the availability of ATC antenna gain as required. For\nthe surveillance case considered, a difference in forward and return signal power of about\n10 dB will exist so that the return signal will be suppressed further in addition to being\nreduced in S/N. Signal suppression effects are considered by preadjusting the i.f. gain\nto provide the proper balance of powers at the input, while S/N enhancement or degradation\nis accounted for in the analysis. The forward signal, being substantially stronger, will be\nrelatively unaffected or even enhanced slightly in S/N. For the purposes of this analysis, it\nis assumed conservatively that no forward-signal S/N improvement is provided from the\npower amplifier, so that the required input S/N will be the same as at the output (+12.0 dB).\nThe required input S/N to the i.f. limiter to provide the output S/N of +12.0 dB is\nfound by taking into account hard-limiter effects as determined by Davenport in ref. 14.\nA graph of output S/N improvement for a single signal passing through a hard limiter is\nshown in fig. 12. As seen, a 2.6-dB improvement is realized for the forward signal, so that\nonly a +9.4-dB input S/N is required.\nFinally, it is seen that a received signal power of -145.3 dBW is required at the\nsatellite, corresponding to a required ATC transmitter power of +0.9 dBW (1.2 watts) for the\nsystem defined. As seen, an extremely small transmitter power is required to meet the\nlink requirements for the ATC and satellite antennas considered. A tradeoff of transmitter\npower and antenna gain at ATC is possible and will be discussed in conjunction with the\nreturn-path performance.\nThe satellite-to-aircraft link performance, also shown in table 4, can now be\ndetermined for the +12.0-dB downlink S/NI. The link parameters, discussed in app. A,\ninclude a regional-coverage satellite antenna, a hemispherical-coverage aircraft antenna,\n2-dB multipath fading margin (which, in conjunction with aircraft antenna discrimination,\nprovides 99% time availability in the North Atlantic region), and a conservative system\ntemperature of 661"K, using a solid-state receiver front end. The power requirements in the\ncarrier, data, and tone channels at the aircraft are discussed in the following paragraphs:\nIn the tone concept considered, all aircraft continuously receive the surveillance\nsignal carrier and respond individually only upon reception of a unique address code. Each\naircraft thus need not acquire the carrier on each subsequent surveillance cycle, SO that a\nlonger acquisition time and narrower carrier tracking 1\nbandwidth can be tolerated.\nder phase-lock loop.

Upon sensing an out-of-lock indication, therefore,\nthe receiver would automatically initiate a sweep over the uncertainty band at a sweep rate\nlow enough to ensure acquisition to a 3 a (99.7%) probability. In the unlikely event acquisition is not made, the sweep would continue until disabled by acquisition indication. All\ncarrier modulation is placed sufficiently beyond the frequency uncertainty range, as described\nin Sec. 3.1.5, so that the possibility of the false lock on a data or tone subcarrier does not arise.\nDetermination of surveillance fix periods, contained in vol. 11, shows fix periods of\n3 minutes to be required for narrowing separation standards to desired distances. An aircraft\nattempting to lock on the carrier, therefore, upon entering the surveillance system or after\nlosing lock, would have several minutes in which to acquire the carrier before surveillance.\nAn acquisition time of 1-1/2 minutes is thus taken as a reasonable compromise; it permits a\nslow sweep of the frequency uncertainty band during acquisition and still enables acquisition\nrequired\nwithout losing more than one surveillance cycle. The tracking loop bandwidth ~ B L\nto ensure 3 a acquisition with one sweep is determined in app. A to be 55 Hz, with a required S/N in ~ B L 10 dB. This 10-dB carrier S/N is likewise sufficient for data\nof\ndemodulation.\nData channel requirements, also discussed in app. A, are for a bit rate of 5 5 bps (sufficent for sync, code, and voice channel status) and a required bit-energy-to-noise-density\nratio ST/(N/B) of +10.4 dB-Hz, resulting in a maximum bit error rate of\nThe five\ntone channels are envelope-filtered out of the baseband from 8 to 10 kHz, with the bandwidth of this filter assumed to be 20% greater than the required 2 kHz in order to preserve\nflat passband response. The required S/N of each tone to the noise in the 2400-Hz filter\nbandwidth is shown in the following section to be -13.0 dB, which results after further\ndegradation at the satellite in a + I 0.0 dB S/N for each tone in its 5-Hz tone tracking loop at\nthe ATC center.\nPower division among carrier, data, and tone channels on the downlink is performed\nso that an optimum power balance is obtained, resulting in a minimum-power link design.\nThe optimization procedure, described by Foley , Gaumond, and Witherspoon in ref. 15,\nuses the required signal-to-noise-density ratios for the various channels to determine the best\nchoice of carrier phase deviations so that the resultant modulation losses balance all channels.\nFurther discussion is given in app. A. The resultant carrier-to-noise-density ratio C/@\nrequired for the forward surveillance link is found to be +36.2 dB-Hz. This is obtained from\nany of the balanced channels. From the data channel, in dB,\nC/@ = (l/T) + [ST/(N/B)]\n= (17.4)\n\n- (modulation loss)\n\n+ (10.4) + (8.4)\n\n(19)\n\n= +36.2 dB-Hz\n\nFor the satellite-to-aircraft downlink, then, a S/N1 of +12.0 dB results in a 0.3-dB\ntotal degradation: a 0.3-dB signal power degradation (fig. 9) plus a zero-dB receiver noise\ndegradation (fig. 10). For a zerodB performance margin in the data and tone channels (the\ncarrier channel is not the limiting one, because the power division optimization results in\nmore than adequate carrier power), it is seen that the effective received power must be\n-164.2 dBW, which corresponds to a total received power of -163.9 dBW. For the system\ndefined, the required transmitter power is then +8.3 dBW, or 6.8 watts. A tradeoff can be\nmade among transmit power and satellite and aircraft antenna gains, which is shown in\nfig. 13, that summarizes the performance of the surveillance forward link.

For a 2-dB realizable antenna\ngain, then, 20-watts of satellite transmitter power would be required. It should be noted\nthat an aircraft antenna implementation of two low-gain antennas mounted off the aircraft\ntop center would increase system noise temperature and multipa th fade margin slightly.\nThese effects would be essentially negated, however, by a resultant lower polarization loss for\nthis antenna configuration. Higher antenna gains, which would result in narrower beams,\nwould reduce system noise temperature, fading margin, and polarization loss; therefore, the\ndata in fig. 13 is quite conservative for this case.\n\n3.1.6.2 Return path, aircraft to ATC: The design of the return surveillance link is\nsomewhat different than that of the forward link, because in the return path it is the uplink\nfrom aircraft-to-satellite that is the limiting case, due to the necessity for maintaining low\ntransmitter power at the aircraft. The downlink is not so critical, because moderate degradation effects can be tolerated due to the availability of a high-gain ATC antenna. The link will,\ntherefore, be designed to minimize aircraft transmitter power by requiring as low a S/N as\nfeasible at the satellite repeater output on the return path. The effects on the downlink of\nadditive noise through the repeater were shown previously in fig. 1 1. Since a low SIN1 in\nthe return-link noise bandwidth Bn2 is desired at the satellite repeater output t o reduce\nrequired aircraft transmitter power, a return-link operating point is selected for a reasonably\nlow S/N1.\nThe required C/G for the return link is seen in a subsequent analysis to be +41.9 dBHz. For the return-link noise bandwidth Bn2 of 47.0 kHz (+46.7 dB-Hz), C/G Bn is thus\n-4.8 dB-Hz. As seen from fig. 1 1, SIN1 must be greater than -4.8 dB for adequate performance, because below this value even unlimited downlink power will be of no use in meeting\nthe link threshold. A S/N1 of -4.2 dB is selected for the return link, permitting low power\nfor the uplink while not requiring too-extreme degradation penalties on the downlink (1 3.1\ndB as seen from fig. 11).\nThe return-path link analysis (table 5 ) shows link performance for the chosen S/N 1 .\nEntries are discussed in app. A. On the uplink,for -4.2 dB S/Nl out of the satellite power\namplifier, a higher S/N must be provided into the amplifier, because the soft limiting effect\nof the power amplifier will degrade the S/N return signal, which is significantly lower than\nthat of the forward signal. The S/N degradation through the power amplifier is estimated\nconservatively using degradation effects for two signals through a hard limiter developed by\nJones in ref. 16. In effect, the degradation from a soft limiter, such as occurs in the power\namplifier, is somewhat less than that for a hard limiter, which thus represents a worst-case\napproximation. Figure 14 shows that a S/N degradation of about 3.4 dB occurs for the\nsmaller signal where a 10-dB ratio between signal levels exists. This value will thus be used\nfor the return-link signal, so that a S/N of -0.8 dB is required into the power amplifier for\n-4.2 dB output S/N.\n\n45\n\nTABLE 5. - MULTIPLE-TONE SURVEILLANCE LINK ANALYSIS: RETURN LINK\nParameter\n1 Transmitter power\n.\n2 Transmitting circuit loss\n.\n3.

As seen, an input S/N of -0.7 dB will result\nin a 0.1-dB degradation for an output SIN of -0.8 dB.\nFinally, it is seen that the received signal power is -1 53.1 dBW, which for the system\nassumed corresponds to a transmitter power of +20.6 dBW ( 1 15 watts) at the aircraft. Aircraft transmitter power can then be traded off with aircraft and satellite antenna gains, as\nfor the forward link; both tradeoffs are shown in fig. 13. As seen, for a realizable\nhemispherical-coverage antenna gain of -1 .O dB at the aircraft and a regional-coverage\nsatellite antenna, an aircraft transmitter power of 115 watts is required. This is of course\na worst-case value that is obtained from the worst-case link analysis with the assumption\nthat both forward and return surveillance signals are routed through the satellite repeater.\nThe link performance for an earth-coverage satellite antenna is also shown, with a 7.8-dB\nlower gain being provided. As seen, for a hemispherical-coverage aircraft antenna, 690 watts\nof aircraft transmitter power would be required, which would result in rather severe\npenalties in prime power and cost. A more feasible implementation would be one providing\nseveral dB of antenna gain at the aircraft so that transmitter power of several hundred watts\nor less could be used. Antenna considerations for such an implementation are discussed in\nconjunction with the forward-link performance at the end of Sec. 3.1.6.1.\nThe satellite-to-ATC link performance (table 5 ) can now be determined for the\n-4.2-dB downlink S/NI. Parameters used in the analysis are discussed in app. A. The\nchannel power requirements are increased, however, for the return surveillance links due\nto the nature of the turnaround tone transmission and the different acquisition problem\nat the ATC than that at the aircraft. As mentioned previously, the received baseband at the\naircraft is filtered in a 2.4-kHz envelope around the 8- to 1O-kHz tones. This total envelope is\nthen remodulated onto the return carrier. The return link, therefore, transmits noise along\nwith the tones so that an increased portion of power is required in the tone channels to ensure\nreception of sufficient tone power for ranging measurements.\nThe noise degradation effects in the tone channels are identical to those that arise\nwhen noise is added by the satellite repeater. The noise transmitted with the tones thus\nresults in two degradation effects: (1) tone signal power degradation that accounts for\nthe power consumed by the transmitted noise, and (2) receiver noise degradation that\naccounts for poorer tone-loop noise performance due to the additive noise. The total tone\nsignal power degradation is the proportion of tone power (all five tones) to total (tones\nplus noise) power in the envelope filter bandwidth. For each individual tone channel, the\ndegradation is the ratio of tone power to total power (tone plus noise) in one-fifth the total\nenvelope bandwidth. The degradation is thus\n\nPlotted in fig. 15 is D1 as a function of T/NI, the tone-to-noise ratio in the 2.4kHz filtered envelope.\nReceiver noise degradation D2\' in the tone loops at the ATC can be determined from\nan expression analogous to eq. ( 18). The degradation in each tone loop is\n\n48\n\n49\n\nwhere T/@ is the required tone-to-noise-density ratio in each tone loop, Bf is the envelope\nfilter bandwidth, and T/N1 is the tone-to-noise ratio in Bf. This degradation can be seen\nin fig. 10 where D2\' is plotted versus T/Nl (S/N1) for various values of T/Q5Bf, shown\nas C/QB,. The ratio T/Q, is defined as\n\n(23)\nwhere ~ B L \' is the tone tracking loop noise bandwidth and T/Nt is the required tone-tototal-noise ratio in that bandwidth. For the scheme considered, ~ B L \' is 5 Hz (+7.0 dB-Hz)\nand T/Nt is +10.0 dB; therefore, T/@ is +17.0 dB-Hz. Similarly, Bf is 2400 Hz (+33.8\ndB-Hz); therefore, T/+ Bf is -1 6.8 dB. The combined degradations for T/QBf of -1 6.8 dB\nare shown in fig. 16 as functions of T/N 1.\nSelection of the optimum design point is more difficult than for the previous case\nwith the satellite repeater, because selection at either extreme of T/N 1 results in penalties.\nA low T/N1 (near -16 dB), for instance, results in extreme degradation. Therefore, prohibitive power requirements must be placed on the return link to overcome this degradation.\nOperation at a high T/Ni , however, would unduly penalize the forward link, because\nadditional power would be required to provide so high a T/N 1. The forward link is the more\ncritical one, however, due to limitations in satellite transmitter power. The design approach\nwill therefore pick an intermediate value near the lower limit to divide the penalties between\nthe two links. For this reason, a T/Ni of -13.0 dB is arbitrarily chosen, resulting in a total\ndegradation of 9.4 dB in each tone channel of the return link (fig. 16). This is comprised of\na 7.0dB tone power degradation (fig. 15) and a 2.4-dB noise density degradation (fig. 10).\nAcquisition problems are also more severe for the return link, because extremely\nrapid carrier, data, and tone acquisitions are required at the ATC center as the response\nfrom each aircraft is received. The traffic analysis (vol. 11) shows that surveillance fix rates\nof about once every 3 minutes are required to reduce separation standards to desirable\n(e.g. 30 n.mi.) lane widths. Since worst-case traffic estimates (peak season, peak hour) are\nfor 150 aircraft in the North Atlantic, a surveillance fix response from each aircraft must be\naccomplished in 1 second, during which carrier acquisition, tone acquisitions and measurements, and data demodulation and synchronization must be performed. The carrier acquisition problem is the most critical, because a frequency uncertainty of up to k8.8 kHz exists\non the incoming carrier (table 3). Fortunately, this is almost entirely comprised of doppler\nshift, because frequency coherence is maintained by the very stable ATC master oscillator.\nIn the normal operations mode, therefore, most of the frequency uncertainty can be predicted, because the location, bearing, and speed of each aircraft are known from the previous\nsunzillance fixes. Estimations of doppler shift can thus be made by the ATC computer, just\nas positions are calculated with each fix, so that an accurate value is known of the incoming\ncarrier frequency from each aircraft as it responds to ATC. A much smaller frequency\nuncertainty is thus possible for each carrier acquisition, permitting fast lockup on each\nresponse. As each aircraft is interrogated, therefore, predicted values of the received\ncarrier frequency would be routed to the two receivers (one for each satellite) where the\ncarrier loop VCO would be reset to the proper value.\n\n50\n\n51\n\nTwo acquisition modes are possible at the ATC: (1) a short sweep over the small\nfrequency uncertainty band, and (2) an unswept-loop pull-in acquisition using a wide enough\ncarrier loop bandwidth to pull in the signal for lockup. Since acquisition within a fraction of\na second is required, the short-sweep technique is preferred, because the pull-in technique\nrequires carrier-loop bandwidths approaching the frequency-uncertainty bandwidth for\nfast pull-in and acquisition.\nOf the 1 second allowed for the aircraft response in the normal mode of operations,\ncarrier acquisition with a 3a acquisition probability is provided in 0.4 second. This leaves\nthe remaining 0.6 second for tone acquisitions, tone phase measurements, data demodulation,\nand data synchronization, all of which can occur only after carrier acquisition is made. The\ntime breakdown for the 1-second response period is near-optimum-from link C/Q considerations, providing sufficient carrier acquisition time for using a moderate carrier tracking\nbandwidth and sufficient data transmission time for a reasonably low data rate.\nTone acquisition, occurring independently for all five tones, will occur rapidly after\ncarrier acquisition is made, because an unswept tone tracking loop can be used, for the minor\ntone frequency uncertainties expected. Gardner (ref. 17) shows that lockup for a signal with\nthe loop bandwidth occurs on the order of l/wn seconds. For the assumed 5-Hz tone\ntracking loops (Wn = 4.71 radians), therefore, lockup would take about 0.21 second. One\nof the locked-up tones could then be used as a reference for data subcarrier demodulation.\nThe aircraft will add the actual return information bits to the data subcarrier about 0.6\nsecond after response transmission is initiated, with synchronization bits (1 0 10 10...) being\nsent for the first 0.6 second, so that bit synchronization can be obtained as soon as possible\nwhen carrier and tone acquisitions are made.\nFor aircraft whose doppler shift is not so accurately known, a wider-sweep, longer\nacquisition sequence would be optional, whereby the duration of the aircraft response is\ncontrolled by a signal sent along with the aircraft address code on the surveillance uplink.\nFor example, the normal aircraft response duration would be 1 second. If no response is\nreceived at the ATC center on a given surveillance cycle, however, the aircraft would be\ninterrogated again several seconds later and told, via a command transmitted with the\naddress code, to respond for perhaps 5 seconds so that the longer ATC acquisition sequence\ncould be implemented. Since this situation would occur only rarely in normal operations,\nthe overall system would not be disrupted. Even at peak loading with 150 aircraft, responses\nof 1 second every three minutes still allow 1/6 of available time (30 seconds) for the longer\nacquisition mode. For normal traffic loads where only 50 to 75 aircraft may be in the\nsurveillance pattern, the load on the surveillance system is substantially below capacity. The\nsystem will thus be designed conceptually to have two acquisition modes, one of a second\nwhereby frequency uncertainty is calculated to 2 kHz and the other of 5 seconds whereby the\naircraft response duration is lengthened by interrogation command on the uplink.\nFor a moderate frequency prediction accuracy to 2 kHz, as opposed to 58.8 kHz\nL\nfor the nonpredictive case, app. A shows that a carrier tracking loop bandwidth ~ B of\n350 Hz is sufficient at the ATC center operating with a carrier S/N of 10 dB within that\nbandwidth. This S/N is also satisfactory for data demodulation. Other channel parameters,\ndiscussed in app. A, include a data rate of 2 10 bps with a required bit-energy-to-noisedensity\nratio of +10.4 dB-Hz for a realizable bit error rate of 10-4. Tone tracking-loop bandwidths\nof 5 Hz are shown to be adequate and a S/N of 10 dB is required in each loop to permit\ndesired measurement accuracy. Modulation indexes for dividing the available power among\ncarrier, data, and tone channels for the phase-modulation scheme considered are again chosen\nto optimize link performance for minimum power requirements using the optimization\ntechniques developed in ref. 15.\n\n52\n\nThe required carrier-to-noise-density ratio of the return surveillance link is now\nfound to be +41.9 dB-Hz. This is obtained from any one of the balanced channels. From\nthe data channel, in dB,\nC/@ = (1/T) + ST/(N/B) - (modulation loss)\n= + 23.2 + 10.4 + 8.3\n\n(23)\n\n= +41.9 dB-Hz\n\nFor the satellite-to-ATC downlink, a S/N 1 of -4.2 dB results in a 13.1-dB total\ndegradation: 5.6 dB signal power degradation (fig. 9) and 7.5 dB receiver noise degradation\n(fig. 10). For a zero-dB margin in the data channel (the carrier channel is not the limiting\none, because the power division optimization results in more than adequate carrier power),\nthe received data subcarrier power must be equal to the threshold subcarrier power (-17 1.8\ndBW). For a -8.3-dB modulation loss, this requires an effective received power of -I 63.5 dBW,\nwhich corresponds to a total received power of -150.4 dBW. For the system defined, the\nrequired transmitter power is then -4.3 dBW, or about 0.37 watt.\nThe performance of the tone channels is found similarly. For the effective received\npower of -163.5 dBW and a modulation loss in each tone channel of -1 5.5 dB, the received\ntone-plus-noise power in each tone channel is -179.0 dBW. Degradations due to additive\nnoise were found earlier to be 7.0 dB and 2.4 dB for D 1\' and D2\'; therefore, the effective\nreceived tone power is -1 88.4 dBW. For a tone tracking-loop bandwidth of 5 Hz and a required tone-to-noise ratio (T/N) of +10.0 dB in the bandwidth, the threshold tone power\nin the channel is -188.4 dBW, which is also received tone power, leaving a margin of zero\ndB. The performance of the carrier channel is similarly found and results in a performance\nmargin of +1.5 dB.\nThe performance of the satellite-to-ATC link under worst-case conditions requires\nonly several tenths of a watt satellite transmitter power for the system considered with a\'\nregional-coverage satellite antenna, a 5-foot-diameter ATC antenna, and a 2 10" K overall\nreceiving system noise temperature (uncooled paramp preamplifier used). The low transmitter\npower presents no significant problems for the power-amplifier scheme proposed whereby\nboth forward and return signals share the available power. Should an earth-coverage satellite\nantenna be used, the resultant decrease in gain (7.8 dB) could readily be compensated by\nincreasing the satellite transmitter power for the return signal to about 1 watt. Since the\nforward signal requires 10 watts or more of satellite power, the effect of the return signal on\ntotal power will be minor.\nIt is also possible that ATC antenna size may change from the 5-fOOt size considered.\nThis is possible particularly if both surveillance and voice links use the same ATC antennas,\nas is presently proposed. Voice-link requirements on ATC antenna gain are not severe,\nhowever, so that the 5-foot size appears reasonable at present. The final size decided upon\nwill be sufficient to accommodate the more limiting function, either voice or surveillance\nlinks.\n3.2 BINOR Surveillance System\nThe second potential surveillance system involves the BINOR ranging technique by\nwhich ranging measurements are made from a satellite-transmitted composite digital code.\n\n53\n\nThe BINOR (Binary Optimum Ranging) scheme is recommended by TRW for the surveillance\nrequirements of the present study. An analysis is performed for determination of the resultant impact on the aircraft terminal and for comparison with the tone ranging system. The BINOR\ntechnique, as would be implemented in a NAVSTAR system (ref. 18), is essentially used for\naircraft navigation in a passive mode. The technique is also adaptable for a surveillance\nsystem, however, with each aircraft informing the ATC of its positions by either:\n(1)\n\nTransmitting periodically the position data as determined by using the BINOR\nimplementation in a navigation mode\n\n(2)\n\nTransmitting only the time-difference data received from the BINOR system\nto the ATC center, where subsequent position calculation for surveillance\ncapability would be made\n\nBoth of these operation modes are considered for evaluating the performance characteristics of the system. A second tradeoff exists for a BINOR system between a foursatellite configuration and a three-satellite-plus-altimeter configuration for determining the\naircraft position. The impact of this selection upon the system implementation is not considered in the analysis. It is possible, however, that the use of three or four satellites with\nequal assignment of voice circuits among them can increase the channel selection/antenna\nbeam-pointing complexity and constraints at the aircraft compared to the two-satellite\nsystem associated with an active tone ranging scheme.\nThe analysis of the BINOR surveillance scheme draws on data from TRW\xe2\x80\x99s previous\nstudy efforts on the NAVSTAR system, as documented in ref. 18. A brief description of\nthe NAVSTAR system and the operation of the BINOR range-difference technique is presented in the next section. The link analysis performed by TRW in ref. 18 is summarized\nin view of the possible SST aircraft terminal parameters presently conceived. This then\npermits comparison with the tone surveillance technique for the satellite-to-aircraft link and\nan evaluation of the impact of BINOR implementation on both satellite and aircraft\nterminals. The remaining links required for surveillance operations by the ATC are then\nconsidered. These include a forward link for orderly interrogation of the various aircraft\nin the system and a return link to the ATC for transmission of aircraft identification and\nposition or time-difference data.\n3.2.1 NAVSTAR/BINOR navigation system. - The NAVSTAR system as proposed\nby TRW is a navigation concept based on time-difference measurementsof L-band signals emitted\nby a network ofnear-synchronous satellites. Each satellite transmits its ranging signal during\nits specific assigned time slot. The signals are accurately timed with relation to each other\nby implementation of an extremely accurate oscillator time standard aboard each satellite.\nThe oscillators are capable of being updated from the ground when drifts are detected from\nperiodic monitoring. The satellite network for a North Atlantic coverage area would consist\nof a minimum of three satellites. The system would require aircraft altimeter measurements\nfor position determination using a hyperbolic technique. This configuration is assumed for\npurposes of analysis, although a four-satellite configuration without altimeter data is likewise\na possibility. It should be noted that the NAVSTAR system operating on a time-difference\nranging scheme would always require one additional satellite than would be required for the\nproposed tone surveillance system , which operates on a time-delay scheme.\nThe L-band ranging signal emitted by each satellite during its time slot of 1.55\nseconds is a time-multiplexed transmission consisting of ( 1) a carrier only, for carrier acquisition (0.38 second), (2) the full BINOR code (0.57 second), (3) the BINOR code clock\n\n54\n\ncomponent only (0.18 second), and (4) satellite data (0.32 second). In addition, a 0.1-second\nanother\xe2\x80\x99s. Since\nguardband is allowed so that each satellite\xe2\x80\x99s transmission does not o\nltaneously and u\ne frequency and\nthe satellites transmit sequentially rather tha\nThe carrierformat, only one receiver is required at the a\nfor reception of\nonly transmission during the first portion of the cycle permits full power for rapid wideband\ncarrier acquisition, after which the carrier tracking loop at the receiver is switched to a lower\nbandwidth to maintain carrier tracking when the subsequent modulation is added. The\nsatellite data transmitted at the end of the cycle includes satellite identification, ephemeris\ndata, oscillator phase drift, and time of day. The data, in PCM format, is split-phase modulated onto the carrier at a data rate of 625 bps. Updating of data at the satellite is performed\nperiodically by the ground station.\nThe BINOR ranging code, which is transmitted during the middle segment of the\nsatellite transmission cycle, is a binary code with a bit rate of 640 kbps and has minimum\nacquisition time for digital ranging codes. The code directly phase modulates the carrier.\nThe BINOR code recommended in the NAVSTAR system is generated from 13 coherent\nsquare waves related in frequency by multiples of two; the lowest frequency is 78.125 Hz\nand the highest (clock) frequency, 320 kHz. This results in the 640-kbps data rate. The\ncode length is 213 or 8192 bits long, which corresponds to a range ambiguity resolution of\nabout 2 100 n.mi.\nTransmission of the code and clock will occur for 0.75 second, which is equal to 58\ncode cycles: the first 44 cycles are of the entire code to permit clock and code acquisition,\nwhereas the remaining 14 cycles are of the clock component alone, permitting sufficient\nclock S/N and measurement time for eight measurements (on the 78.125 Hz component of\nthe code) to obtain the ranging accuracy required. The generation and acquisition of the\nBINOR code is implemented with digital logic techniques, which results in accurate, fast,\nstate-of-the-art components.\nUser aircraft equipment for operations with the NAVSTAR/BINOR system was\ndefined and priced by TRW. The configuration required for the most sophisticated user\n(an SST aircraft) permits self-contained navigation with the highest available accuracy. The\naircraft terminal was defined as that shown in fig. 17. It is comprised of five prime\ncomponents: antenna, receiver, preprocessor, general-purpose computer, and display/control\nunit. Since additional SST equipment is required to implement the surveillance capability\nrequired, only the L-band antenna would be common to both functions. The following\nparagraph (from ref. 18) describes NAVSTAR equipment operation for an automatic, selfcontained SST user terminal:\n\nSignal transmissions from up to eight satellites are received by\nthe user\xe2\x80\x99s L-band antenna and are demodulated in the BINOR\nreceiver. The preprocessor processes and decodes the two\nkinds of data appearing during satellite transmission - ranging\ndata and satellite data. The output of the preprocessor is\nproperly formatted for direct entry into the general-purpose\ncomputer. Using the range (phase) measurements, ephemeris,\nand other data received from the satellite, the general-purpose\ncomputer calculates the user\xe2\x80\x99s absolute position and presents\nit to the user via his display and control unit.\nEstimates of hardware costs for the aircraft terminal equipment were also presented\nby TRW. These costs for the five major subsystems are shown in table 6 and are derived\n\n55\n\nlIE\n\nE\n\nI\n\nI\nI\nI\n\nI\nI\nI\n\nI\n\nI\nI\n\n56\n\nI\n\nSubsystem\n\nCost per unita\n$\n\nAntenna\n\n325\n\n7 130\n\nReceiver\nPreprocessor\n\n11 630\n\nComputing\n\n35 700\n\nD isplay/control\n\n15 000\n\nTotal\n\n$69 785\n\n57\n\nbased on production runs of 100, which is realistic for an SST-type aircraft. As seen, total\nterminal cost would be about $70 000 per aircraft. Further cost reductions could be realized\nfor 1000 units, with about 35% reduction per unit expected.\nIn addition t o the basic NAVSTAR/BINOR terminal equipment described, capability\nmust be added for using the system for ATC surveillance purposes. The implementation thus\nrequires additional aircraft equipment for (1) receiving interrogation from the ATC and (2)\ntransmitting position or time-difference data back t o the ATC. The choice of data return\nfor the surveillance function, either position or time-difference data, depends upon the\ndegree of complexity that can be tolerated at the aircraft terminal. With a full NAVSTAR\ncapability, position is known by each user because calculation is made by the onboard computer. To simplify the terminal, however, so that an onboard computer would not be required, it is possible to implement the surveillance system with the aircraft sending only .\ntime-difference and altimeter data to the ATC; calculation of aircraft position would then\nbe performed for surveillance. It should be recognized, however, that for this case the selfnagivation capability of NAVSTAR is nonexistent, because position calculation is made at\nthe ATC center.\nIt should further be noted that the accuracy of the BINOR code (to 30 feet rms) is\nmuch greater than that required for commercial aircraft surveillance purposes in the North\nAtlantic area. Informal discussions with NASA/ERC indicate that TRW is preparing an ATC\naddendum to the earlier NAVSTAR study. This addendum was not available at the time of\nthe writing of this report; it could significantly modify the above comments.\n\n3.2.2 Link parameters. - The NAVSTAR system is considered in a configuration\nproviding an ATC surveillance capability. The parameters required to support the BINOR\nranging signal on the satellite-to-aircraft link have been determined in TRW\xe2\x80\x99s report. The\nkey parameters are listed below:.\n.50 watts\nSatellite transmitter power ..............................\nSatellite antenna gain ...................................\n+ 16 dB\nAircraft antenna gain. ..................................\n0 dB\nCarrier loop bandwidth\nAcquisition (S/N = 6 dB) ..............................\nJ 650 Hz\nTracking with modulation (C/N = 10 dB) ................ . 5 0 Hz\nClock loop bandwidth .................................\n. 2 6 Hz\n+21 dB\nClock loop S/N (range accuracy = 30 ft) ....................\nDatarate ............................................\n625 bps\n+9.5 dB\nData channel ST/(N/B) ................................\nThe parameters are associated with the single-satellite transmission time slot of 1.55\nseconds, which for an eight-satellite design provides a position fix about every 12.0 seconds.\nThis fix rate is considerably beyond the 3-minute fix requirement developed in the North\nAtlantic traffic analysis of vol. 11. However, the parameters in the table are assumed in defining the terminal BINOR receiver in vol. V. It should be noted that when the TRW satellite\nparameters are adjusted to the regional-coverage antenna and zero-dB worst-case margin\nused in the tone-system link analysis, the two techniques are competitive.\n. ._._\nThe remaining link parameters requiring definition are those associated with the\nforward-interrogation and return-position data links. These links are analogous to the forward and return links associated with the active-tone surveillance system discussed in Sec.\n3.1. The difference is the somewhat reduced power requirements; the tone signals are not\nrequired for the BINOR scheme, because position data are obtained through the NAVSTAR\n\n58\n\nwhereby all aircraft are\nunique address of the particular aircraft is received in the roll-call sequence, the aircraft\ntion of the aircraft terminal\nThe link analysis w\nforward and return links. A surveillance fix period of 3 minutes and an interrogation\nperiod of 1 second were assumed for the tone surveillance system. In addition, a data\nscheme similar to that of the tone forward link (Sec. 4.2) was assumed with a message length\nof 55 bits, for a data rate of 55 bps during the 1-second interrogation period. The results show .\nthat the forward-link power requirements are about 5 dB lower than those for the tone case,\nbecause no tones are required. Satellite power requirements are thus minor in comparison\nto those of the BINOR code link and the individual voice links. For the return link, a response cycle similar to that of the tone system was assumed - the ATC must acquire the\ncarrier and subcarrier and demodulate and synchronize the data within the 1 second. TRW\nhas estimated (ref. 18) that message lengths of 220 and 100 bits are required for the two\npossible response modes (time-difference and position data, respectively). Since carrier\nand subcarrier acquisition will require 0.6 second, only the last 0.4 second will be used for\ntransmitting the actual data. This results in a data rate of about 550 or 250 bps respectively.\nSince these data rates are higher than for the tone response (which includes both data and\nturned-around tones), system performance is nearly identical for the return link. Again,\nhowever, power requirements at the aircraft and satellite are small in comparison to those of\nthe voice links.\n3.3 Surveillance System Summary\nThe analysis and discussion of the previous sections have established the characteristics\nand performance capability of both an active tone ranging system and TRW\xe2\x80\x99s NAVSTAR\nrange-differencing techniques. The evaluation was aimed primarily at implementing an ATC\nsurveillance function for control of aircraft in the North Atlantic. The results of the analysis\nshow that the NAVSTAR concept when modified to provide surveillance can achieve precise\nposition accuracy (< 100 feet) compared to an active turnaround tone ranging system\n(- 1 n.mi.) for the same link performance capability. The precise accuracy capability is not\ndictated by ATC surveillance requirements in the North Atlantic, which can be met with the\nrelatively coarse accuracy of the tone technique. There is a significant difference in the airand complexity that would favor a tone system. The choice of a specific\nthe domain of this study; the air\nterminal design presented in vol. V\n\n59\n\n4.0 COMMUNICATIONS S\nDATA TRANSFER,\n\nSeveral study aspects related to the over\ndiscussed in this section, including system\nchannel requirements for the digital data\nsurveillance signals, and voice-channel ac\nchannel, multiple-user voice link system. Each of these topics, significant in the operational\nand evaluation of the\nsystem, is considered in detail for determination of system require\noverall impact on the aircraft terminal in terms of complexity and\nThe first topic considered is routing of the various voice and surveillance signals\nthrough the satellites, primarily in terms of the satellite repeater configuration. Several\nalternate routing schemes are available, depending upon whether both voice and surveillance\nsignals utilize the same broadband repeater at a satellite or whether separate repeaters are\nprovided for each function. A similar trade arises with regard to the choice of voice-link\ntransmission through one or several satellites. These alternates are significant in that system\nperformance, and thus aircraft equipment configuration, is dependent upon the repeater\nselection. Of particular importance, and given prime emphasis, are the requirements that\neach system would impose on the terminal in terms of antenna gain, pointing control,\ntransmitter power, signal processing, and system operational procedurzs.\nThe second study area is that of data channel requirements for the digital data subcarrier transmitted on the surveillance links between the ATC and the aircraft. Discussion\nis given of the synchronization and message requirements on both the forward and return\nlinks, with emphasis on determining required data rates. Related topics, such as address and\nsynchronization codes, and sequencing considerations of the data transfer in an operational\nsystem are also discussed. The minimum information to be transmitted includes frame\nsynchronization, aircraft address code, commands, and voice channel status on the forward\nlink in addition to synchronization, aircraft identification, altimeter measurement, and\nvoice channel requests and other digitized data on the return link. Preliminary consideration\nis also given to data transmission rates, error rates, and selection of optimum address and\nsynchronization codes.\nThe final topic of investigation is voice channel access, in which the operational\nproblems of efficient system usage for a multiple-user voice scheme are outlined. Two\nselected modes of user access are considered: a controlled-access system in which the va reus\naircraft utilize voice channels under direction and control of a ground controller, and a\nrandom-access system in which aircraft initiate voice transmission with updated knowledge\nof channel status. The advantages and operational considerations of each technique ar\ndiscussed, particularly with respect to the impact of each upon the number of required\nvoice channels, channel availability, and inherent delay times in an operational system.\nThe two techniques are compared with respect to performance criteria, and recommendations\nare made for adaptation to an operational system.\n4.1 Communications System Routing Alternates\nThree alternate system configurations, postulated with respect to voice and surveillance signal routing through the satellites, are considered in this section in terms of overall\n\n60\n\nimpact on the aircraft terminal design for an operational system. The alternates are presented\nfor an assumed two-satellite system in which active-aircraft surveillance is performed using\nmplex surveillance\nboth satellites and aircraft altimeter measurements. In the event a\nng techniques, and\nsystem is adopted, with multiple (three or four) satellites,\naircraft measurement of ranging signals, data return to the\nuld be made over\nser turnaround\nonly one link, rather than through both satellites as for th\nIn the event transmission of surveillance data through only one satellite\naspects of voice transmission discussed here are applicable.\nThe alternates were selected based on two epential system trades:\n(1)\n\nEqual or unequal loading of voice links through the satellite\n\n(2)\n\nDependence or independence between voice and surveillance links with\nrespect to the satellite repeater configuration\n\nIn a system with equal loading, the available voice channels are divided equally\namong the several satellites, whereas with unequal loading all voice channels are routed\nthrough one satellite. Similarly, the voice and surveillance signals in one satellite can be\nrouted through one broadband integrated repeater or through separate voice and surveillance\nrepeaters. From these possible modes of operation, three candidate system routing alternates\nare proposed for subsequent investigation:\n(1 )\n\nAlternate 1 - separate voice and surveillance, unequal loading\n\n(2)\n\nAlternate 2 - separate voice and surveillance, equal loading\n\n(3)\n\nAlternate 3 - integrated voice and surveillance, equal loading\n\nEach of these alternates is studied in terms of impact on the aircraft terminal and the\noverall performance and operation of the system. Topics of particular importance include\nthe effect of the various alternates upon aircraft antenna configuration and gain, pointing\nrequirements, transmitter power, and signal processing. In addition, overall system characteristics are considered, such as rf bandwidths and spectrum allocation, channel access, and\nperformance degradation. Each of the three proposed alternates is evaluated in the following\nsections, with a final comparison of the three being made from the advantages and disadvantages of each.\n4.1.1 Alternate 1: separate voice and surveillance, unequal loading. - Alternate 1\nemploys separate, independent voice and surveillance repeaters in the satellite, with all voice\nchannels being routed normally through one satellite. The relative link geometry among the\nATC, satellite, and aircraft terminals for Alternate 1 is shown in fig. 18, which shows both\nnominal and alternate signal routing through the two satellites. As can be seen, capability\nwou\nvoice links, with only one satellite actually\nt in both satellites for routing\nat any one time; the voiceel capability of the remaining satellite would\nbein\ntandby redundant mode.\n\ns are assumed as a typical ex\nle for the operational system. As\ndescribed later in Sec. 4.3, each aircraft has the capability of using any voice channel by\nswitching at the voice modem. General operational access procedures would have each aircraft use only one assigned channel under nominal flight conditions, with switchover to\nother channels made only in accordance with predetermined procedures.\n61\n\nI\n\nI\nI\nI\n\nI\n\nI\nI\nI\n\nI\nI\n\n8\nrir\n\n0\n\nG\n\n62\n\nI\nI\n\nThe prime advantage of alternate 1 is that an aircraft can gain access to all voice\nchannels through one satellite. Thus, it is not necessary to reorient the aircraft antenna beam\nto the second satellite when selecting channels. For antenna gain at the aircraft greater than\n6 to 8 dB, the system geometry between the aircraft and the two satellites is such that only\none satellite can potentially be in the beam at once. The link analysis done to date\nthat this level of gain may well be required on the experimental program. It is anti\nthat, to be cost effective, the operational satellite system will have to permit operation with\na lower aircraft antenna gain, so the advantage of alternate 1 in simplifying beam pointing\ndisappears as the aircraft antenna requirements approach hemispherical coverage.\nA significant disadvantage of alternate 1 is the increased satellite effective isotropic\nradiated power (EIRP) required to handle all the voice channels. The increase power requirements would be a minimum of +3 dB, plus allowance for additional signal suppression and\nintermodulation (IM) degradation effects with the doubling of the number of channels in a\nsingle hard-limiting satellite repeater.\nIn addition, a large increase in repeater bandwidth can be expected if Sevy\xe2\x80\x99s\n(ref. 12) solution to eliminating intermodulation effects is followed. For example, a hardlimiting satellite repeater required to pass two channels, each of bandwidth B, must have\na guardband B between them to eliminate IM effects. Thus, the repeater passband is 3 B.\nOn the other hand, if the same repeater is required to pass four similar channels, there is a\nnonlinear increase in the required passband. To eliminate third-order IM effects, a passband\nof 15 B is required; and to eliminate both third- and fifth-order IM effects, the required\npassband rises to 31 B.\nThe voice-channel repeaters shown in fig. 18 at each satellite have the same frequency\nassignments, so that if the standby repeater in the second satellite is activated, voice link\noperations can proceed without any change in channel frequencies. Should such a switchover be made, each aircraft would be commanded to reorient its directive beam antenna to\nthe second satellite. ATC command data can be forwarded to the aircraft with the surveillance interrogation signal, which is received on the aircraft\xe2\x80\x99s low-gain antenna. Voice operations would then proceed as before. The use of the standby repeater in the second satellite\npermits full voice communications even with the loss of one satellite, so that voice system\nreliability is quite high.\nFigure 18 also shows identical frequency surveillance repeaters at each satellite for\nhandling the forward and return signals. The system definition described in Sec. 3.0\nprovides for routing the forward surveillance signal through only one satellite, with the\nsingle aircraft response made through both, so that the surveillance repeater at one of the\nsatellites would have only one signal, the aircraft response, present. The repeaters would be\ndesigned to handle both signals, however, since routing of the forward signal will be changed\nby the ATC ground station periodically to update the satellites\xe2\x80\x99 position fix. Frequency\nassignments at both surveillance repeaters are identical, since the surveillance replies routed\nthrough the two satellites on the same frequency are separated by the ground station antennas\xe2\x80\x99 spatial diversity, with the beam of each ground antenna encompassing only one satellite.\npropos\nsurveillance links\nin each satellite with the available voice links being divided equally between satellites. The\nlink geometry for alternate 2 is shown in fig. 19, illustrating all nominal and alternate link\nrouting among the ATC, satellites, and aircraft.\n\n63\n\nG\n6\nu\n\nu\'\n\nr---\n\n1\n\n\'1\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\nI\n\n-I\n\n64\n\nchannels, through the remrlinjng satellite, for the degraded mode of operations. Alternate 2\nwould also adapt easily to an area-coverage satellite antenna system. In this system, one\nsatellite would direct a narrow high-gain beam to the western half of the coverage area,\nproviding three-channel voice service to the aircraft there at a higher EIRP than that of an\nearth- or regional-coverage satellite. The other satellite would have the s\ncapability with an area-coverage beam directed to the eastern sector of th\narea servicing the local aircraft with the second set of three voice channels. This concept\nwas not fully explor\nring the study, although it is recogni\nhat provision would have\nto be made at the sa\nto receive the surveillance reply fro\ncraft in both sectors for\na turnaround system.\n4.1.3 Alternate 3 : integrated voice and surveillance, equal loading. - The final\nproposed alternate features equal loading of voice links between the two satellites and an\nintegrated broadband repeater on each satellite to accommoda both voice and surveillance\nchannels. Link geometry is illustrated in fig. 20, showing nom 1 and alternate links among\nthe ATC, satellites, and aircraft terminals. The features of alternate 3 are described in the\nfollowing paragraphs.\nThe advantages of equal loading of voice channels between satellites are as discussed\nunder alternate 2, with the attendant reductions in EIRP at the aircraft and prime power at\nthe satellite over the unequal-loading case. A further advantage of alternate 3, however,\ne\n\n65\n\n-\n\nAircraft No. 1\n\n.\n\nc2.\nSatellite No. 1\n\nATC\n\n:,\nI;\n\nI\nAircraft No. 2\n\ns:\n\nc4vsR2\n\n-\n\nI\n\nSatellite No. 2\n\nC\n\n*.\n\n= forward surveillance signal\n\nSR\n\nc4\n\n= voice channels\n\nSF\n\n.*I\n\n= return surveillance signal\n\nFIGURE 2 .

Thus, the repeater passbands of the\ntwo satellites could be made selective enough so that each would pass the same frequency\nsurveillance channel but reject those voice channels assigned to the other satellite while\npassing its own voice channels.\nVoice channels through each satellite have different frequency assignments, so that\nsatellite repeaters cannot be completely identical. In addition, problems of reorienting the\naircraft antenna for change to a voice channel through a different satellite are present, as\ndescribed for alternate 2.\n4.1.4 Comparison and recommendations. - A comparison can be made among the\nthree routing alternates, based on the impact upon both aircraft and satellite terminals and\nupon overall system operations. The following criteria are used in comparing the alternates:\n(1)\n\nSatellite prime power required\n\n(2)\n\nEffective radiated power required by aircraft\n\n(3)\n\nResultant aircraft equipment complexity\n\n(4)\n\nSpectrum allocation bandwidth required\n\n(5)\n\nResultant satellite equipment complexity\n\n(6)\n\nDegraded system operation, with loss of one satellite\n\nThe various factors were considered in the discussion of the alternate routing\nschemes, so that relative comparisons between the three schemes can be made directly.\nRequired spectrum allocations can be further defined on a numerical basis for the\nrequired voice and surveillance channels. Figure 21 shows this comparison for the repeater\nbandwidths of each alternate. Voice and surveillance link bandwidths and frequency\nuncertainties were included. For the surveillance channels, allowance was also made for a\nguardband between the channels with a bandwidth equal to the channel information bandwidth. Guardbands were not included for the voice spectrum estimates because, while\nguardbands might be considered for a three-channel voice repeater, the required number of\nguardbands and resultant passband when the voice channels go to six or more becomes\nexcessive when considering efficient spectrum usage. As mentioned earlier, Sevy\xe2\x80\x99s (ref. 1 2)\nwork shows a required passband of 15 times the voice channel bandwidth ( 15B) to pass four\nvoice channels with no third-order IM effects. Much earlier work by Babcock (ref. 19) shows\na lower estimated passband of 7B for the same channel requirements.\nUnfortunately, Sevy\xe2\x80\x99s work is not extended to the six-channel case corresponding to\nthe unequal loading of alternate 1. Babcock\xe2\x80\x99s work, which appears to give an unrealistically\nlow estimate, still shows a required repeater passband of 18B for passing six voice channels\nwithout third-order IM effects. Third-order IM effects are of concern because, if the active\nvoice channels are placed adjacent to one another, the third-order products can fall directly\ninto an active voice channel at a level only 9.5 dB down from the normal channel power.\nThe interfering signal is expected to be incoherent, but this is one area that requires in-depth\nanalysis and experimentation to show the impact of third- and possibly fifth-order products\non voice circuit intelligibility as well as possible disruption of the threshold performance of\n\n68\n\nthe aircraft\xe2\x80\x99s phase-locked voice demodulator chosen later in the terminal design selection.\nIn summary of the spectrum considerations, though alternates 1 and 2 are shown in fig. 21\nas being the same, it can be expected that alternate 1 requirements will be higher. Thus,\nalternate 2 has the lowest spectrum requirement (240 kHz minimum).\nA final tabulation of comparative criteria for the three alternates is made in table 7.\nAs seen, the three criteria most critical to system operation (aircraft EIRP,\npower, and aircraft equipment complexity) favor alternate 2. For this reas\nis chosen as the best scheme for routing the voice and surveillance links for an operational\nsystem, since this results in the simplest equipment at the aircraft, which is the most\nsignificant terminal in terms of overall system cost and feasibility.\n4.2 Data Channel\nFrom the information presented in Sec. 3.0, the surveillance carrier modulation\nconsists of six subcarriers (channels), in which five channels are required for five ranging\ntones and one channel is required for binary data. The information contained within the\ndata channel and the requirements imposed on the data channel are discussed in this section.\nIn order to understand why a data channel is needed, and what requirements the data\nchannel must satisfy, a synopsis of the surveillance modem is given. From the information\npresented in the synopsis, the basic data channel requirements can be derived.\n4.2.1 Surveillance modem synopsis. - As shown in Sec. 3.0, an efficient means for\nthe surveillance of an aircraft via a two-satellite ranging system is for the ground to initiate\na ranging signal. Operationally, the ranging signal (five tones) is transmitted continuously\n(forward link) to one of the two satellites, with the satellite repeating the received ranging\nsignal to all aircraft. This approach allows all aircraft to maintain frequency lock. The\nparticular aircraft under surveillance remodulates the received ranging signal and transmits\nit (return link) to both satellites. Thus, in order to distinguish which aircraft should\nremodulate the ranging tones, a unique address must be associated with the ranging signal\nand, thereby, the need for a data channel. Furthermore, since the envisioned surveillance\nmodem is a time-division multiplexing system, synchronization of received data (bit and\nframe sync) and the ability to update the voice channeI status display require that all\naircraft continuously receive and decommutate the data subcarrier. In addition to the\naddress and sync requirements, the amount of aircraft traffic in the principal area and the\nsurveillance fix rate impose requirements on the data channel. These additional requirements\narise because the address code length is a function of the amount of traffic, and the required\nsurveillance fix rate determines the data channel bit rate. Finally, there is the requirement\nthat the reply signal (return link ranging and data) of an aircraft\nng close to the satellites\n(near edge of the principal area) does not mask or overlap a reply signal of an aircraft that is\nflying at the far edge of the principal area.\nTherefore, the general requirements imposed on the data channel are (1) a code\naddress compatible with predicted aircraft traffic, (2) a frame sync compatible with the\nmessage format (address plus other data), (3) a surveillance interval necessary to insure no\noverlapping of signals, and (4) a bit rate compatible with surveillance fix rate. A cursory\nanalysis of these requirements generates sufficient information to size the data channel; i.e.\nto provide the minimum acceptable bit rate requirements (forward and return link) for the\nlink calculation. Since the primary objective of this section is to provide inputs to the link\nchart, the analysis of optimum codes, data formats, and compatibility with proposed digital\n\n69\n\n0\n\nm\n.-\n\nc3\na3\n\nc\n,\n\nW\n\nt;\n0\n\nI\n\nJ\n\nc,\nv)\n\nL\n\nS\n\nE\n\nL\n\nE\n\nm\n\n6\n.-\n\n0\n\nI\'\nW\n-\n\nz\n\na\n\n6\n\n51\n\nW\n\nm\n.-\n\nJ\n\nz\n\nN\nI\'\nW\n-\n\nm\n\nE\nI\'\nW\n-\n\n3\n\nI-\'\nv)\n\nS\n\nE\n\n6\n\n-\n\n0\n\ns\n\n0\nJ\n\nW\n\n.G\nJ\n\nr\n\n~\n\nC\n.-\n\nE\n\nm\n.\n-\n\nm\n\nv\n\nI\'\nW\n-\n\nm\n\n0\n\n+\n\nc\n\nL\n\nI\'\nW\n-\n\n3\n\n(CT\n\nc,\nfn\n\nc,\nv)\n\nc,\nv)\n\nW\n\nW\n\nr\n\nW\n\nr\na\nl\n.I\n\nr\ncn\nI\n\n.- .r\ncn\n\n5\n\'5\nU\n\nu\n\nc\n\nm\n\nL\n\n..t\n(0\n\nL\n\nW\nc\n,\n\nP\n\n.E\n&.\n\n0\nK\n0\n.-\n\nc,\n\nm\n\n8\n0\n\nW\n\nE\n\n_.\ne\n\nI\'\n-\n\n.-\n\nc,\n\nW\n\nc\n,\n\nQ\n\n70\n\n2\n\n8\nP\n\nv)\n\nsystems (ref. 20) is not covered in depth, primarily because the existing specifications are\nnot defined. However, the next phase of this study will finalize the selection of format,\ncodes, and messages transferred.\n4.2.2 Data channel requirements - forward link. - For the forward link, the data\nsubcarrier is continuously being received, tracked, demodulated, and decommutated by\n\nFrame Sync\n\nAddress 1\n\nAddress 1\'\n\nAddress 1"\n\n*\n\nwords would have to have identical errors passing through the address comparator; if only\none out of the three address words is in error, no erroneous response will be initiated.

Since a new data frame is\nsecond, the channel\nnearly continuous i\n\n4.2.2.3 Extended response command: This command allows added surveillance\nsystem flexibility, since an airplane can be spotlighted without the interruption of the\nsurveillance of other airplanes. Spotlighting (reinterrogation) is possible, since for peak\ntraffic conditions there exists at least 40 seconds during each surveillance cycle (3-minute\nsurveillance cycle) in which airplanes can be reinterrogated if necessary. Thus, several airplanes can be reinterrogated in the case of conflicting surveillance data. A further explanation of the implementation and need for the extended response command is given in\nSec. 3.1.6.2.\nIf a false extended-response command is processed, it would result in simultaneous\nreply transmission for the next seriallyinterrogated aircraft ,which in turn would mask both return\nlink signals. Therefore, reaction to such a false response command would require reinterrogation by the ATC and would thereby perturb the surveillance mode. Therefore, in order\nto guard against a false response command and thereby satisfy random bit error requirements, a 3-bit word would be sufficient; however, to guard against burst errors, a 7-bit or\nlonger word is required. Thus, for now, a 7-bit word is recommended.\n\n4.2.2.4 Frame sync: .In determining the frame sync pattern, the sync pattern must\ninsure that there is (1) a low probability of false sync and (2) a high probability of true sync\nwithin a reasonable number of frames. In order to satisfy the above requirements, one must\nselect a frame sync pattern of the (1) correct length and (2) of the correct format (pattern).\nFor the forward link, one can assume a random bit stream (message) following the frame\nsync bits; this assumption is valid, because the message consists of an %bit (times three)\naddress code, a 7-bit channel status word, and a 7-bit extended response command.\nConsider now a frame length of d bits with an n-bit frame sync word followed by a\ntotal of b random data bits. at can be shown (ref. 2 that the probabili\nd- 1\nwhere e is the all0\nPi(e) is the probab\n\n(26)\ns a true sync word and\nthe message portion of the\n\n73\n\nThe quantity Pi(e) in turn is given by:\n\nThe message format discussed in Sec. 4.2.2 results in a fra\nAssuming a criterion of e = 1 in the sync detector, table 8 shows the effect of n on the\nworst-case probability of false sync.\nThe probability of achieving true sync Pt on the first frame\n\nen by:\n\nPt = (1 - P i p Pc\n\n(29)\n\nwhere:\n\n-\n\nn!\nP\'( 1 - P)n-r\nP c = 5\nr = ~\n(n-r)! r!\nand P is the probability of a bit error on the data link, which for this study is chosen as\n10-4. For the case of n = 17 and e = 1, then:\n\nwhich is a good criterion for achieving frame sync on the first frame. Moreover, obtaining\nframe sync on the first frame is not as critical for the forward link, since only one in every\n130 or more frames requires a surveillance reply (frame sync) from a particular aircraft.\nFurthermore, the probability of frame sync increases as the number of received frames\nincreases. The probability that no sync Po will occur in K frames is:\n\nwhich results in:\n\nP, = 3\n\n10-3\n\nP0=8.1x10-11\n\n; n=17 , K = l\n; n=17\n\n,K=4 .\n\nTABLE 8.-EFFECTS OF SYNC WORD LENGTH\n\n74\n\nReturn link acquisition is more\nchannel. This occurs because the\nwhereas for the re\n\nust receive frames from different users with different\n\nto be transmitted prior to the transmission of the data on the subcarrier and then to use the\nranging tracking loop to drive the ground bit-sync loop. Thus, an envisioned system would\nhave the aircraft under surveillance remodulate the tones, for the full 1 second, and then\nsend the data channel information 0.6 second after the initiation of the ranging tone transmission. Therefore, during the approximate 1--second reply interval, the first 0.6 second\nwould be used to transmit a bit sync data stream (101010 ...) on the data subcarrier so that\nbit sync is obtained should carrier and tone acquisition be made earlier than the allocated\n0.6 second. The remaining 0.4 second would then be used to transmit information data on\nthe subcarrier.\n\n4.2.3.1 Address code length: Since the return link response can be correlated with\nthe forward link address, the return link address requirements are less stringent than those\nof the forward link. An address length of 9 bits, 8-bit address plus a parity bit, is used,\nsince the correlated probability (forward link and return link) of a false identification due\nto random bit errors is low.\n4.2.3.2 Altimeter data: In order to determine an aircraft\xe2\x80\x99s position with a twosatellite ranging system, an altimeter reading is required. The altimeter reading must\n\n4.2.3.3 Voice requestjcontrolled access: As shown in vol. 2, Sec. 3.1, the voice\nmessages have been prioritized into four categories. If a controlled-access modem scheme\nis employed (see discussion of channel access in Sec. 4.3), it is necessary for the pilot to\nsend both a voice channel request and a message-priority indication. The four priority indications plus the request/nonrequest indication can be accomplished with a 3-bit code. If\n\n75\n\n4.2.3.4 Bit sync: Bit sync must be established before frame sync and data\ndemodulation can occur. Since the ground will have to track random phase errors, the\nreturn link bit synchronization creates a more serious problem than the forward link bit\nsynchronization. To resolve the bit sync problems (1) the ranging tones are transmitted\nprior to the transmission of the data on the subcarrier and their phase error inserted into\nthe bit sync loop, and (2) alternate ones and zeros are transmitted ahead of the data frame\nfor bit sync. The return link data transmitted would be of the form and sequence as\nfollows:\n\n1\n\nI-\n\nI\n\ntones\nAt = 0.61 second\n\n-.I\n\nF\n$\n\nI\n-1\n\nAt\xe2\x80\x99= 0.38 second\n\n-1\n\n4.2.3.5 Frame sync: Again the selected frame sync pattern should provide a low\nprobability of false sync and a high probability of lock during the surveillance cycle. For\nthe return link case, the bits used for bit sync are assumed to have a probability of false\nframe sync equal to or less than the message bit stream, since their format is fixed. Therefore, only the data following the frame sync word is considered, and it is assumed to be\nrandom.\nThe probability of false frame sync Pf is determined from the formulations of\nSec. 4.2.2.4. For the case of 20 message bits, and accepting I-bit error in the sync detector\n( e = l), then:\nPf = 0.053 f o r n = 13\nand:\nPf = 0.0043 for n = 17\n\nIn the same manner as before, the probability of true sync Pt being achieved on the first\nframe is:\nPt = 0.941 for n = 13\nPt = 0.992 for n = 17\nTo satisfy the requirements of a low probability of false sync and a high probability of true\nsync on the first frame for a communication system with random bit errors, an n of 17 is\nselected. Again, by judiciously selecting the frame sync pattern, the probability of false\nlock can be decreased. For the return link case, the same Legendre code used for the forward\nlink is selected. If a burst error occurs and the data is degraded, the ground will have the\ncapability of reinserting user address for reinterrogation of the aircraft.\n\n4.2.3.6 Overlap requirements: Since the aircraft are distributed throughout the\nprincipal area, an aircraft at the near edge of the principal area (aircraft 2) receives a surveillance interrogation sooner than an aircraft at the far edge of the principal area (aircraft 1).\n\n76\n\nTherefore, if aircraft 1 is interrogated followed by an interrogation of aircraft 2, the\nsurveillance system must insure that the return signal from aircraft 2 does not overlap the\nreturn signal from aircraft 1. The approximate worst-case round trip time differential\nbetween the two aircraft is 2 At, which equals 0.01 second. It can be seen from the time\nflow diagram (fig. 23), that if a 0.01-second overlap interval is provided, no return signal\nwill be overlapped.\n\n4.2.3.7 Bit rate: The return link bit rate is dependent on (1) ranging lockup time,\n(2) number of bits required, and (3) overlap interval. Due to the overlap requirements, the\nreturn link interval equals 0.99 second, where the first 0.61-second is required for carrier\nand tone-ranging phase lock, thereby leaving 0.38 second for data channel transmission.\nSince 40 bits are provided for bit sync after tone subcarrier lockup, and 37 or 40 bits are\nrequired for the data frame, the bit rate equals 77 or 80 bits in 0.38 second, or 202 to 21 0\nbits per second.\n4.2.4 Data channel characteristics summary. - In order to satisfy the requirements\ngiven in Sec. 4.2.2, the forward link data frame consists of the following:\naddress\n\naddress\n\ncommand\n\nchannel status\n\nwhere\nFrame sync\n\n. . . . . . . . . . . . . a 17-bit Legendre code\n\nAddress (3 times).\n\n........\n\nOverride command\n\n.......\n\nChannel status\nFrame length\nBit rate..\n\n...........\n\nan 8-bit address code\na 7-bit command for extended\nreturn-link reply\n\na 7-bit voice channel status\n\n. . . . . . . . . . . . 55 bits\n\n...............\n\n55 bps\n\nThe sequencing of the forward link data frames is accomplished at the ground control\nstation.

Five of the six channels are used for normal voice traffic, and one channel\nis provided for emergency messages. Two possible means of enabling user access to the voice\nchannels are (1) a controlled-access technique and (2) a random-access technique. Thus, the\nfollowing section defines the applicable access techniques, analyzes the operational requirements, compares the two access methods, and then recommends an access technique for the\noperational system.\n4.3.1 Ground-controlled access. - A method of providing ground-controlled access\nto the voice channels is depicted in fig. 24. Operational ground-controlled accessing can be\nfunctionally described as follows: Prior to takeoff, an airplane is assigned a voice channel\nfor receiving and transmitting messages during the flight. When a pilot needs the use of a\nvoice channel, he pushes a request button, which in turn sets the voice request logic in the\noutput data circuitry. The setting of this register adds a 3-bit word to the return data\nchannel surveillance reply. Therefore, when the next surveillance reply is transmitted, the\nchannel request is included. Thus, by selecting the proper code, the pilot not only indicates\nhis request but also is able to indicate the priority of his message. When the request is\nreceived by ATC, a go-ahead is given to the pilot based on a combination of call-in order\nand message priority. If ATC requires that a pilot use an alternate channel in order to serve\nhis request, then a second forward link data channel would be required. There is a possibility\nthat a pilot could request a voice channel just after his airplane has been interrogated and\n\nThus, since a controlled\nwith each of the given p\n\nble voice traffic delay.\ntized, the delay associated\n\n79\n\nE\n\n80\n\ncs,\n\nE\n.-\n\nwithin an acceptable delay period-a 10-second maximum, for instance. The information\ngiven in vol. 2 shows that five voice channels would satisfy communications requirements\nif a controlled-access technique with instantaneous response is employed. The inherent\n3-minute delay in the implementation scheme described necessitates a sixth channel be\ndedicated for emergency use only.\n4.3.2 Random access. - A method of random access to the voice channels is\ndepicted in fig. 25. Operational random accessing can be functionally described as follows:\nPrior to takeoff, an airplane is assigned one of the five voice channels for receiving and\ntransmitting messages during the flight. When a pilot needs the use of a voice channel, he\neither waits for an opening in his assigned channel or switches his transmitter and receiver\nto an unoccupied channel and then initiates his message. The pilot selects an open channel\nbased on the information provided from his received channel status display. The channel\nstatus display is updated every second from received voice-channel status words provided in\nthe forward-link surveillance data channel (Sec. 4.2.2.2). Channel hopping is undesirable\nfrom an ATC viewpoint, since it forces a given ATC controller to respond not only to\nnormally assigned traffic but also to random inputs. Thus, a pilot would be restricted to\nchanging channels only when he had both a priority-one message and his assigned channel\nwas occupied. However, if a pilot changed channels, he would then be dealing with a\ndifferent air-traffic controller.\nSuch a channel change requires a callup of current flight status data to the new\ncontroller. Furthermore, it should be noted that channel switching is dependent on\nreceiving the voice-channel status word; therefore, a failure in the forward link data channel\nwould require the pilot to aurally monitor channels and then select an open one.\nBased on the above, if the problems associated with random access cannot be\nresolved via pilot discipline or ATC exchange of information, an additional channel would\nhave t o be provided t o maintain acceptable priority-one message delays. In the randomaccess case, message delay is not a function of the surveillance reply, and therefore message\ndelays would be much smaller than with the proposed controlled-access technique. Emergency messages would be sent on the normally open emergency channel.\n4.3.3 Comparison and recommendation of access techniques.- A comparison of the\nsignificant parameters is given in table 9. Of the two accessing techniques discussed, the\nrandom-access technique is recommended at this time. The primary reason for its selection\nis that the message delay for the controlled-access technique described is too long. Furthermore, equipment complexity aboard the airplane and at the ground are less for the randomaccess technique. It must be noted that this discussion is of a cursory nature and a more\nin-depth analysis will be performed in the next phase of this study.\n\n81\n\n82\n\nTABLE 9.-COMPARISON 0\n\nAccess delay (avg 1\n\nNEL ACCESS\n\n3 min\nm\n\nBit rate: return data\nlink\n\n210 bps\n\n202 bps\n\nAirplane complexity\n\nGreater\n\nLower\n\nATC complexity\n\nGreater\n\nLower\n\nAlternate channel\nassignment\n\nGround-initiated via\naddition of forward data\nchannel\n\nPilot-initiated\n\n83\n\nthe parametric st\nIn order to make\nperformance parameters\n\nrred to through0\n\ncarrier (DSBISC), single-sideband/suppressed-carrier\n(SSB/SC), and low-energy speech transmission (LEST). These techniques are compared on the bases of average power, peak power,\nbandwidth, and S/N input requirements. Next, angle modulation is discussed in terms of\nthe same parameters. The types of angle modulation considered include: narrowband freM), wideband frequency modulation (WBFM), and a hybrid\nquency modulation (\nd amplitude modulation (FRENA).\ntal techniques are\ntechnique of frequen\nthe most desirable modudescribed and the significant characteristics are presented. Fin\nlation techniques are compared parametrically in terms of both percent word intelligibility\n(%WI) and articulation index (AI) versus carrier-to-noise density (C/ 46 ).\n5.1 Voice Characteristics/PerformanceParameters\nSpeech has a spectrum extending to about 10 kHz and an amplitude distribution\ncharacterized by a large peak-to-average power ratio. Figure 26 illustrates the results of\nseveral sets of measurements of the intensity of speech as a function of frequency. It can\nbe seen that the power density begins to fall off above 500 Hz and approaches an asymptotic\nslope of 12 dB per octave at 800 Hz (ref. 24).\nThe relative performance of a voice communication system can be calibrated in terms\nof the message intelligibility received. Thus, the obtainable percent intelligibility of a\nsystem should be specified. However, the percent intelligibility is dependent upon the type\nof material spoken and upon the type and skill of the talkers and listeners. To overcome\nthis ambiguity, percent intelligibility of various spoken material is plotted as a function of\n\npeech as defined is\n\n84\n\nFIGURE 26.- A VERAGE SPEECH SPECTRA\n\n85\n\n90\n\nfkk\nI\n\n0.2\n\n03\n.\n\nArticulation index, AI\n\nfJGURE27.- PERCENTAGE OF INTELLIGIBILITY VERSUS ARTICULATION INDEX\n\n86\n\nTABLE 10.-20 FREQUENCY BANDS OF EQUAL\nCONTRIBUTION TO AI\nFrom ref. 27\nNumber\n\nLimits, Hz\n\n1\n\n200 to 330\n\n270\n\n2\n\n330 to 430\n\n380\n\n3\n\n430 to 560\n\n490\n\n4\n\n560 to 700\n\n630\n\n5\n\n700 to 840\n\n770\n\n6\n\n840 to 1000\n\n920\n\n7\n\n1000 to 1150\n\n1070\n\n8\n\n1150 to 1310\n\n1230\n\n9\n\n1310 to 1480\n\n1400\n\n10\n\n1480 to 1660\n\n1570\n\n11\n\n1660 to 1830\n\n1740\n\n12\n\n1830 to 2020\n\n1920\n\n13\n\n2020 to 2240\n\n2 30\n1\n\n14\n\n2240 to 2500\n\n2370\n\n15\n\n2500 to 2820\n\n2660\n\n1\n6\n\n2820 to 3200\n\n3000\n\n17\n\n3200 to 3650\n\n3400\n\n18\n\n3650 to 4250\n\n3950\n\n19\n\n4250 to 5050\n\n4650\n\n20\n\n5050 to 6100\n\n5600\n\n87\n\nSince intelligibility is of prime concern rather than speaker recognition or\nsystem is desirable, because proper\npleasantness, speech processing in a civil communica\ner required (ref. 28). Normally,\nprocessing permits a savings in the peak and average\nthree types of speech processing are considered: baseband truncation, emphasis\nand clipping. Here, only the effects of baseband truncation and clipping\nbecause emphasis/de-emphasis with clipping does not improve the requir\nthe FM case and provides only a small improvement for the AM case (ref. 6). Furthermore,\nfrom fig. 28, it can be seen that the relative intelligibility, emphasis, and non-emphasis of the\ntwo cases is slight. Thus, emphasis/de-emphasis need not be incorporated in a voice system\nin which clipping is used.\nhere are two kinds of speech\nClipping removes part of the speech wa\nclipping: peak and center. Center clipping re\nortion of the speech waveform\nbelow some specified amplitude, whereas peak clipping removes a portion above a specified\namplitude. For peak clipping, the amount of clipping is defined as a ratio (in dB) of the\npeak voltage to the peak minus the clipping level. From fig. 29, it can be seen that center\nclipping drastically affects intelligibility. The extremely marked effect is caused by the fact\nthat center clipping strips out the weak consonant sounds (high-frequency terms) and leaves\nonly the vowels, which are less important than the consonants for intelligibility (ref. 30).\nTherefore, center clipping will not be considered further.\nPeaks in speech power of 14.2 dB above the average speech power can be expected\nfor about 0.1% of the time; smaller peaks occur more frequently. The effects of peak\nclipping; as shown in table 1 1,can improve system performance by reducing the peak-toaverage power ratio. The data shown in table 11 supports the conclusion given in ref. 3 1,\nthat a small amount of uniform speech peak clipping (12 dB or less) does not affect the\narticulation scores of a voice communications system in noise conditions where the scores\nexceed 70% of word intelligibility. Reference 6 recommends a 6-dB peak-to-rms ratio at the\ninput to the modulator, whereas CCIR recommends a peak-to-rms clipping ratio of 7 to 8 dB\n(ref. 32). The final section of a clipping ratio will be made in Sec. 5.2.\nIn the design of a communications system for a particular AI, the achievable AI is\n. dependent upon the baseband transmitted. For normal telephone voice transmission, a\n\nbandwidth from 200 Hz to 3200 Hz is used. Most of the speech energy, and hence the\nintensity, is concentrated in the lower frequencies. However, it is the higher frequencies of\nthis baseband that contribute to the greatest amount of intelligibility (fig. 30). Therefore,\nfor a first approximation to the baseband required, practically no intelligibility is lost if\nfrequencies between 200 and 3200 Hz are transmitted (ref. 33). The actual baseband selected\nis dependent on the modulation technique and associated system noise spectrum. The CCIR\nrecommends a baseband of 3 kHz for space communications; a 3-kHz baseband corresponds\nto existing SSB voice communications; or 6 kHz for present amplitude-modulated voice\nsystems (ref. 32). The fmal selection of the baseband transmitted will be given in Sec. 5.2.\n5.2 Modulation Tradeoffs\n5.2.1 Linear analog modulation. - Three types of linear analog modulation are\ndiscussed. These are amplitude modulation (AM), double-sideband/suppressed carrier\n(DSB/SC), and single-sideband/suppressed carrier (SSB/SC). In addition, a pulse position\nmodulation technique (LEST) is also described. An initial comparison of the relative merits\nof each of these is based upon the relative peak and average power and the bandwidth\nrequirements. In addition, the effect of where clipping takes place (audio versus rf) and\nwhat level of clipping is to be recommended is included.\n\n88\n\nSuccessive test sessions\n\nFIGURE 28.- WORD INTELLIGIBILITY OF PROCESSED SPEECH VERSUS TEST SESSIONS\n\n89\n\nClipping, dB relative to a 12dB peak-to-rmsratio (1% probability)\n\nFIGURE 29.- WORD INTELLIGIBILITY VERSUS CLIPPING\n\n90\n\n91\n\n92\n\nA comparison between the types of linear analog modulation requires that the\nwaveform be specified (ref. 34). For purpose of comparison, a sinusoidal modulating signal\nis assumed, because normally a 1000-Hz sinusoidal test tone is specified to test a voice\nsystem (ref. 35).\nAmplitude modulation, the control of the amplitude of the transmitted signal by the\nmodulating waveform, can be expressed as\n\nDouble-sideband/suppressedcarrier differs from the normal AM by simple suppression of\nthe carrier term; it can be expressed as\nDSB/SC\n\n2\n\n(wc- wm)t-\n\n(wc+wm)t+\n\nel\n\nSingle-sideband/suppressed-carrier differs from DSB/SC by removal of one of the sidebands;\nit can be expressed as\nE\n\nSSB/SC\n\n2\n\n( wc\n\n+ om) + 8\nt\n\n(35)\n\nwhere\n\nwc = the carrier frequency\no m = the modulation frequency\nma = the modulation index\nE,\n\n= the amplitude of the modulated waveform\n\n8 1 = the relative phase\n\nFor these modes, the average power and peak power at the input of the demodulator is\ngiven in table 12, columns 1 and 2. Also shown is the minimum i.f. bandwidth required\nassuming coherent detection.\n5.2.1.1 Gzm-er-to-noiseratio requirements: A parameter of primary importance to\nthe system design i s the required input C/N to meet output S/N requirements for each of the\nmodulation techniques. The output S/N (given in table 12) in the voice baseband is plotted\nas a function of the input C/N in twice the baseband (fig. 3 1). By inspection of table 12,\ncolumns 4 and 5, one can see that for the same (S/N)o an AM system requires more peak\npower and average power than SSB/SC and DSB/SC systems.\n5.2.1.2 Voice acquisition: At L-band, the maximum frequency uncertainty (Sec. 8.0,\ntable 20) expected at an SST using a satcom system is approximately k4.2 kHz. Consequently, the communications system would be required to use a phase-lock loop or an\nautomatic frequency control (AFC) circuit to track a pilot carrier transmitted prior to voice\n\n93\n\n0\n\n.-\n\nE\n\nE\n\nY-\n\nY-\n\nN\n\nN\n\nE\n\nY-\n\nN\n0\n\n01\n\nN\n\nd\n\nw\n\nw\n\nw\n\n/\n-\n\n-0\n\n94\n\n0\n\n0\n\nw\n\n5:\n\n\\\n\nm\n\nv)\nv)\n\n(C/NIi in 2 fm, dB\n\n1\n\nFIGURE 31.4S/Nl, VERSCCS;( / v ,\nCll.\n\n95\n\ntransmission if distortion is to be avoided. Furthermore, by knowing the exact phase-in\naddition to the frequency-of the received signal, one can obtain optimum reception for a\nDSB/SC signal. The optimum and nonoptimum coherent reception differ by a factor of\n2cos2 ($i - $o) for DSB/SC and is phase invariant for SSB/SC. This is shown in the\nfollowing equations:\nA DSB/SC signal at the input to the detector (ref. 36) is of the form\ned(t) = E, b(t)\n\nCOS (Oct\n\n+ 9 i)\n\n(36)\n\nwhere Ec is the peak amplitude, b(t) is the message, wc is the carrier frequency, and\n9 i is the phase of the input signal.

It should be noted that due to the characteristics of AM,\nSSB/SC, and DSB/SC signals, linear amplifiers would be required. Thus, the present peakpower-limited spacecraft amplifiers are not suitable for efficient linear operation.\n\n5.2.1.5 CZipping (SSB/SC): It has been shown by Ainsworth (ref. 37) that the major\nportion of speech intelligibility is carried in the zero crossings of the speech waveform. By\nclipping in the audio band and reamplifying the clipped waveform, there is a gain of average\npower (ref. 38). Figure 32 shows the relative gain of power as a function of the peak clipping\nlevel for AM and DSB/SC waveforms. However, as peak audio clipping of an SSB signal is\nincreased, there is a point where the peak-to-average power ratio will actually increase\n(ref. 39). Insight into the effect of a large amount of clipping (a square-wave modulating\nwaveform) can be gained by assuming the DSB outp\nf the product demodulator is\nrepresented by the following (ref. 34):\n\nthe resultant filtered SSB signal eSSB(t) is:\n\nE\n\nsin(nn/2)\n\nn=1,3,5\n\ncosnwmt\n\n1\n\ncoswct\n(in-phase component)\n(45)\n\n(quadrature component)\nAt t = T/4\neSSB(t = T/4)\n\nr\n\n97\n\nAmount of peak clipping, dB, with respect to 14.2-dB\nspeech peaks (0.1% probability)\n\nFIGURE 3 . POWER GAIN VERSUS PEAK CLIPPING RATIO\n2-\n\n98\n\nFor this assumed waveform, the frequency components of the modulating signal are\nharmonically related to the fundamental frequency of the modulating signal. In the process\nof translation, however, this harmonic relationship is lost and, consequently, the frequency\ncomponents will all add \xe2\x80\x9cin phase\xe2\x80\x9d at t=T/4 . Therefore, as a modulating wave approaches\na square wave due to clipping (fig. 33), the SSB/SC peak-to-average power increases according to the following relationship (ref. 34):\n\nwhere I\xe2\x80\x99 is the standard gamma function and v is a function of the shape of the\nmodulating waveform. For these relationships, a square-wave SSB modulating signal requires\nlarger peak-to-average power ratios than a sinusoidal SSB modulating waveform, as shown in\nfig. 34. This simplified analysis says that if a SSB audio signal is infinitely clipped, much larger\namounts of power would be required to recover the entire modulated voice signal at the\nreceiver, and a DSB/SC modulation technique would be superior if audio clipping were\nemployed. Therefore, for clipping to be effective for SSB/SC, clipping should take place\nat the rf and not at the audio freguency stages. The value of rf clipping and filtering of a\nspeech wave in a peak-power-limited system (satellite application) has been shown experimentally\nby Ewing and Huddy (ref. 40). The experimental apparatus is given in fig. 35. As pointed out\nin this reference, there are two advantages to be gained by rf clipping and filtering over\naudio clipping and filtering. These advantages are: less distortion and less peak power\nrequired. It is relatively easy to see how there would be less distortion by considering the\nfollowing power-series representation of the output of a typical clipper.\neo = klei\n\n+ k2ei3 + k3ei5 + .\n\nNow consider the input to the clipper as\nei = Acos q t + Bcosw2t\n\n(49)\n\nTherefore, the output would contain the following frequencies:\n\nIf clipping and filtering were to occur in the audio baseband, many of these frequencies\nwould be within the baseband. However, if the speech wave is translated to the rf signal, the\ndistortion components introduced by clipping will be of the order of magnitude of the\ncarrier frequency and, except for the lowest-order terms, will be \xe2\x80\x9csplattered\xe2\x80\x9d away from\noriginal frequencies of the spectrum. However, it should be noted that distortion associated\nwith the filtering and frequency translation of the clipped wave should not be too severe.\nThe power advantage of rf clipping over audio clipping can be directly derived by\nconsidering the results given in eq. (47) for audio and the test results given in ref. 40 for\nthe rf. The test results are given in terms of received percent word intelligibility of\nphonetically balanced (PB) words versus clipping level for different received S/N. These\ntests indicate that for a 18-dB peak rf clipping ratio with a peak-to-rms factor of 6 dB and\na received S/N rms ratio of 14 to 18 dB, word intelligibility of 93% can be achieved.

The rationale for employing emphasis is that by\nincreasing the amplitude of the high frequency terms, a greater AI can be achieved because\nmore frequency bands are included; i.e. a greater AI \xe2\x80\x9cweighting.\xe2\x80\x9d However, with the recommendation there was no mathematical description of how emphasis and rf clipping (two\nnonlinear parameters) can be combined and give optimum results in a \xe2\x80\x9cnoisy\xe2\x80\x9d aircraft\ncockpit environment nor was the test data given. Therefore, for the first phase of this study,\nan rf bandwidth of 3.0 kHz is recommended; however, the final selection of bandwidth would\nbe made in the next phase of the study, if SSB/SC were selected as the most desirable\nmodulation technique available for satellite-aircraft communications.\n\n5.2.1.7 Linear analog modulation recommendations: Based on the previous analysis,\nthe following parametric values are chosen for the SSB/SC voice channel characteristics.\n(1)\n\nSSB/SC with a pilot carrier\n\n(2)\n\nrf clipping with a peak-terms factor of 6 dB\n\n(3)\n\n3.0-kHz rf bandwidth\n\n(4)\n\nVoice baseband of 200 Hz to 3200 I-Iz\n\n5.2.1.8 LEST (low-energy speech transmission): For the purpose of this analysis,\nGeneral Electric\xe2\x80\x99s LEST system can be depicted as shown in fig. 36. At the transmitting end,\nthe zero-crossings of a speech waveform are detected, and each crossing then generates a\nfixed length (but arbitrary in time) pulse. As stated previously, detection of the zerocrossings provides most of the intelligence of speech. The sequence of pulses then amplitude\nmodulates an rf camer. At the receiver, the signal passes through a bandpass filter and the\nfiltered signal is then envelope-detected. The detector output is then applied to a flip-flop\ncircuit, which triggers when the leading edges of the incoming pulses exceed a given level. The\nflip-flop output is then fed to a low-pass (audio) filter, which in turn produces the desired\noutput.\n\nReference 42 develops the pertinent relationship for the output S/N for various\ninput C/N ratios:\n\np\n\n= -1\ncy fm\n\nWhere fm is highest baseband frequency, Q! is the standard deviation of the assumed\ngaussian pulse and p may be regarded as a \xe2\x80\x9cbandwidth-expansion\xe2\x80\x9d factor analogous to the\nmodulation index in FM. This expression for output S/N has been plotted in fig. 37 as a\nfunction of peak-to-rms C/N with p as a parameter. It should be noted that fig. 37 assumes\ncontinuous FM transmission in which the peak and average power would be the same. It has\nbeen experimentally observed that the LEST signal undergoes a sharp transition in the\nneighborhood of a 5-dB peak carrier-to-rms-noise ratio. In fig. 38 the output SIN is plotted\nas a function of average input C/N for both LEST and FM.\n\n103\n\nTransmitter\n\nY\n~ - 1\nn\nA, cosoc t\n\nY\n\nOscillator\n\nReceiver\n\nut\n\nFrom ref. 36\n\nSpeech waveforms,\n200-2500 Hz,\npre-emphasized\n\nZerocrossing pulses\n\nEnvelopes of RFtransmitted pulses\n\nReconstructed\nspeech waveform\n\nFIGURE 36.- SIMPLIFIED BLOCK DIAGRAM OF G.E.5 LEST SYSTEM\n\n104\n\nFIGURE 37.- OUTPUT SIGNAL-TO-NOISE RATIO FOR CLIPPED AND FILTERED SPEECH,\nPEAK-POWER CASE\n\n105\n\n-10\n\n-5\n\n0\n\n5\n\nCarrier-to-noise ratio, C/Ni, dB\n\nFIGURE 38.- OUTPUT SIGNAL-TO-NOISE RATIO FOR CLIPPED AND FILTERED SPEECH,\nAVERAGE-POWER CASE\n\n106\n\nSince the data in figs. 37 and 38 are given for both LEST and\nLEST with FM is now possible. For a Gven output S/N, and thereby a\nity\nlevel, an F M signal requires approximately the same carrier peak power\ntechnique (fig. 37). The LEST technique requires less average power (fig. 38) than an\nequivalent F signal, because only the zero-crossings (pulses) are transmitted. However,\nM\nalthough there is an advantage in average power required, one cannot take advantage of the\nadditional average power available for another voice c\nvoice transmission) without extensive processing, bu\nTherefore, the LEST system in its present state of development does not offer a\nower limited.\nmeaningful advantage in lowering C/@ over that of an FM syst\ndulation\nAnother consideration of LEST is that since it is essentially a\ntechnique, the effect of distortion and multipath fading could cause greater degradation of\noutput signal than a narrowband FM system. Thus, distortion can be caused by either an\nerror in the received pulse\xe2\x80\x99s position or by noise triggering the flip-flop circuit in the\nreceiver. Furthermore, during discussion, G.E. stressed that LEST had not been tested in an\naircraft noise environment. There is the possibility that high cockpit noise levels may cause\nthe LEST to output a continuous non-coherent pulse stream.\nTherefore, since (1) there is no real advantage in peak carrier power required and\n(2) LEST is more sensitive to distortion, LEST will not be considered for system optimization at this time.\n\n5.2.2 Angle modulation. - The two types of angle modulation mentioned are phase\n(PM) and frequency modulation (FM). A comparison of narrowband (NBFM) and wideband\n(WBFM) frequency modulation is given followed by a discussion of threshold extension.\nSpeech clipping and its relationship to FM is analyzed. A hybrid technique, frequency and\namplitude modulation (FRENA), is also discussed. Both phase and frequency are special\ncases of angle modulation. In the PM case, the phase of the carrier varies with the modulating signal; in the FM case, the phase of the carrier varies with the integral of the modulating signal. Since PM demodulation performance improvement over AM is less than or\nequal to FM for the cases considered, only FM will be considered. In FM, the instantaneous\nfrequency depends linearly on the modulation signal b( t). The instantaneous frequency is\ngiven by\n\nso that the instantaneous phase angle Q (t) for sinusoidal modulation is\n(53)\n\n107\n\nor in Bessel function representation as\n\nwhere\nui\n\n= instantaneous frequency\n\nuc = carrier frequency\n\np\n\n= modulation index\n\nAf\n\n= peak deviation\n\nfm = highest modulating frequency\n\nc\n\nIn table 13, the significant sidebands, relative power amplitude of the corresponding\nBessel functions, bandwidth, and average power are given. They are referred to in Secs. 5.2.2.1\nthrough 5.2.2.8.\n\n5.2.2.1 WBFM versus NBFM: Figure 39 is a plot of the output S/N as a function of\ninput C/N\xe2\x80\x99s for demodulation using a standard discriminator (ref. 43). I t can be seen that for\nwideband frequency modulation (WBFM) greater output S/N\xe2\x80\x99s can be obtained with wider\nradio frequency bandwidths for equivalent input C/N\xe2\x80\x99s than for narrowband frequency\nmodulation (NBFM). However, for a communications system (single-voice channel) that is\n(1) severely limited in available C/@ (carrier-to-noise density) and (2) a system that at most\nrequires a maximum of 18 ta 20 dB S/N output, a NBFM technique is more desirable than\nWBFM, because the greater improvement and hence greater C/@requirement is not needed.\n5.2.2.2 Threshold extension: For standard demodulators, a threshold exists above\nwhich the S/N of the output becomes a linear function of the C/N at the input. For an\nSSB/SC detector, this threshold is reasonably close to zero dB input C/N. In the standard\nFM case, threshold occurs at a higher input C/N (12 dB typical) and then the output rapidly\ndeteriorates for inputs below threshold (fig. 39). Therefore, to be competitive with AM\ntechniques in the lower input C/N regions, only angle modulation with threshold extension\nwill be considered. Thus, the input signal can be further attenuated and the output will still\nbe available.\nThe two extension techniques available -.phase-lock demodulator and a frequencylock demodulator - both employ a voltage-controlled oscillator. When a high output S/N is\nrequired, say 40 to 50 dB, a frequency-lock demodulator is superior to the phase-lock\ndemodulator (ref. 44). However, for smaller output S/N\nments, which correspond to\nsmaller frequency deviations, the frequency-lock demod\nts like an ordinary frequency\ndiscriminator and hence would have a higher threshold than a phase-lock demodulator. Since\nsmall frequency deviations are expected, less than or equal to * 5 kHz, and a low threshold is\nis desirable, a phase-lock demodulator is selected. A 6-dB threshold value is assumed for the\nphase-lock demodulator and is taken from ref. 45.\n\n108\n\nE\n\nE\n\nE\n\nE\n\nE\n\nY-\n\nY-\n\nY-\n\nY-\n\nY-\n\nN\n\nN\n\nd\n\n(D\n\n00\n\nc-\n\nN\n\nm\n\nd\n\nN\n\n0\n\n8\n\nN\n\n.9\n0\n\nc-\n\n.\n0\n\nQ,\n\n2\n\nfi\n\nc9\n\n0\n\n109\n\n(C/Nli in 2 fm (audio baseband). dB\n\nFIGURE 39.- SIGNAL-TO-NOISE CHARACTERISTICS OF FM WITH CONVENTIONAL\nDEMODULATORS\n\n110\n\nsignal.

Hence, only NBFM with a phaselock demodulator will be considered in further detail.\n\n5.2.2.4 CZipping (NBFM): A NBFM wave consists of a large carrier term plus\nsmaller sideband terms, whereas a WBFM wave has a smaller carrier term with increased\nenergy in the sideband terms. This energy distribution is due to the fact that with an\nincrease in the frequency deviation, which corresponds to an increase in the amplitude of\nthe modulating signal, the spectrum of the FM wave or bandwidth will increase accordingly\n(ref. 46). Thus, for the voice characteristic, the corresponding modulation index and\nfrequency deviation would correspond to that of fig. 40. When speech clipping is employed,\nthe ratio of speech peaks (peak deviation) to speech rms values (rms deviation) can be\nreduced. For a peak-power-limited system, speech clipping will provide more mean speech\npower than when no clipping is employed. However, by peak clipping the speech waveform,\nthe rms level of speech somewhat decreases according to fig. 41 and, thus, a new peak-to-rms\nratio exists.\nA cursory explanation of speech processing a NBFM signal is as follows (see fig. 42):\nSpeech is read in at (a), and then the input speech is amplified (b). Next, the speech is\nclipped (c) and then the clipped speech is fed through a bandpass filter (200 to 3200 Hz) to\neliminate distortion (d). Next, the modified speech peaks are amplified (e). Therefore, the\npeak-to-rms frequency deviation ratio has been reduced for the frequency spectrum of\ninterest. Since the FM improvement is proportional to the frequency deviation, more mean\nspeech power is available for the same peak deviation, and thereby the \xe2\x80\x9ceffective modulation\nindex\xe2\x80\x9d is changed. It should be noted that modulation index per se loses some of its\nsignificance for random modulating signals.\n\ntionship to FM, the speech\nis characterized as having\naverage rms spectrum\nfirst be defined if anal\nvary not only in time\nprobability of occurrence but also with frequency. The reference clipping level used for this\nanalysis is defined as a 6-dB peak-to-rms ratio at the input of the modulator.\n\n111\n\n60\n\n10\n\nE\n\n0\n.-\n\nm\n2 1.0\n4-\n\n3\n\nU\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\nFrequency,\n\nFIGURE 40.- FREQUENCY DEVIATION AND MODULATION INDEX VERSUS FREQUENCY\n\n112\n\nAmount of peak clipping, dB with respect\nt o 14.2dB speech peaks (ref. 38)\n\nFIGURE 41.- DECREASE IN RMSSPEECH POWER\n\n113\n\n36\n\n30\n\n24\nrn\n\n-\n\nU\n\n$\n\nz\n.E\nc\n,\n\na\n\n18\n\nc\n,\n\nC\n.a\n\n>\n.m\na\n\nc\n,\n\na\n\n12\n\n6\n\nC\n\n200\n\n1000\nFrequency,\n\n2000\n\nHz\n\nFIGURE 42.- RELATIVE SPEECH POWER tNTENSlTY VERSUS FREQUENCY\n\n114\n\n-lo\n\n1\n\nu,\n\nFrom ref. 27\n\nMean frequenciesof bands of equal contribution to articulation index, Hz\n\nSPEC\n\n115\n\nFor the clipping ratio defined, the obtainable percent word intelligibility or\ncorresponding AI can be determined.

With apost-clipping peak-to-rms ratio of\n6 dB, the maximum AI for the noise-free case is approximately 0.64. This AI value is\nderived from eqs. (55) and (56); the resultant speech maxima-to-minima ratio is 24 dB in\neach band after clipping.\nWhereas the ATC environment can be assumed quiet, the cockpit of an airplane is a\nnoisy environment. To determine the precise AI for a given application, the microphone\ncharacteristics and the level of masking noise (system and environmental) must be considered.\nHowever, if newer microphones are used, their characteristics are relatively flat (no emphasis/\nde-emphasis) and microphone characteristics need not be further considered for this\napplication. Beranek points out in ref. 27 that eq. (55) can still be used to calculate the AI,\neven when noise is present, if one redefines Wi as follows:\n\nIn a noisy environment, talkers speak louder, thereby raising the relative levels of\nspeech minima and maxima that are shown in fig. 43. However, there is a \xe2\x80\x9cloudness level,\xe2\x80\x9d\ndepending on whose data are used, of approximately 95 to 110 dB on the scale of fg 43, in\ni\nwhich intelligible speech cannot be derived, because speech at this level begins to \xe2\x80\x9ctickle\xe2\x80\x9d\nthe ear. The cockpit masking noise levels for a Boeing subsonic jet have been measured and\nthe SST levels have been estimated. The associated speech levels in these aircraft cockpits are\nunder study. The system\xe2\x80\x99s noise or link noise is proportional to f2 for FM. For the present\nanalysis, it is assumed that the combined effect of the system noise and environmental noise\ntends to mask all voice frequencies above 3.2 kHz; however, the talkers speaking louder tend\nto compensate partially for the masking noise.\n5.2.2.5 Carrier-to-noise ratio requirements: From fig. 40, it can be seen that the\nmodulation index varies from 64 to 1.O for a corresponding variation of modulating frequency\nfrom 200 to 3200 Hz. Because of this, the standard FM output equation can not be used to\ndetermine the input C/N required, because this equation without modification and interpretation is not valid for voice.\n\n116\n\nHowever, the input C/N requirements can be\xe2\x80\x9cderived by establishing the following\nperformance criteria. The criteria established are: ( 1) the phase-lock demodulator\xe2\x80\x99s loop\nerror should be small and (2) the received voice grade-of-service should equal a percent word\nintelligibility of 95% or an AI of 0.6. The loop error, as defined by Develet in ref. 46a,\nconsists of modulation errors and noise errors. The loop error is a function of the received\nsignal strength. Develet\xe2\x80\x99s paper suggests maintaining an input C/N of 9 to 10 dB.\nThere are two means of determining the required input C/N necessary to satisfy\ncriterion (2). The first, and somewhat more rigorous, is outlined in the following steps:\n(1)\n\nDetermine the output S/N rms achieved in each of the AI bands for a\ngiven (C/N).\n\n(2)\n\nDetermine the magnitude of speech peaks above the rms level after clipping.\n\n(3)\n\nCalculate Wi in each of the frequency bands, i.e. use eq. (57).\n\n(4)\n\nUse eq. (55) to determine AI.\n\nA second method available is to use the experimental results to determine the output\nS/N required to obtain a particular percent word intelligibility and then convert the percent\nword intelligibility into the corresponding AI. This is a nonlinear relationship, and care must\nbe taken when converting percent word intelligibility to AI.\nThe output S/N required for percent word intelligibility is shown in fig. 44 from\nMartin (ref. 3 1). The S/N-versus-C/N equation is taken from Thomas (ref. 47) and is:\nS/N = 3 p 2 (C/N) in 2 times the audio bandwidth (in 2fm)\nwhere\n\np\n\n=\n\nAf\n\n2 (modulation index)\nfm\n\nAfp =\nk2 =\n\n-\n\nk(Af2{/2\n\n(peak deviation)\n\npeak-to-rms factor\n\n5.2.2.6 Bandwidth (NBFM): The standard equations, Carson\xe2\x80\x99s Rule, etc., given for\nestimating rf bandwidth are not applicable for voice communications systems, because\nthese equations are based on a fixed modulation index.\n\nFor voice communications, the only realistic way of determining the required\nrf bandwidth is to examine the energy distribution and decide how much energy should\nbe included. The energy distribution of an FM wave can be estimated by examining the\nBessel function associated with the voice baseband and then determining which harmonics\n(Bessel functions) are significant. The baseband frequency required to support the earlier\nAI criteria of 0.6 is 3200 Hz. For this study, it is assumed that an rf bandwidth four times\nthe highest required baseband frequency is adequate for the low peak frequency deviations\nused. Thus, the voice rf bandwidth becomes 12.8 kHz.\n\n117\n\n118\n\n5.2.2.7 Angle modulation recommendation: Based on the previous analysis, the\nfollowing parameter values are chosen for the FM voice channel characteristics:\n\n(1)\n\nVoice baseband: 200 to 3200 Hz\n\n(2)\n\nRF bandwidth: 12.8 kHz (1 3 kHz)\n\n(3)\n\nPeak-to-rms ratio into modulator: 6 dB\n\n(4)\n\nPhase-lock demodulator\n\n5.2.2.8 FRENA: Frequency and amplitude modulation (FRENA), a technique\ndeveloped by the Phillips Company of the Netherlands, is a hybrid of SSB/SC and NBFM.\nIn the FRENA technique, a carrier is SSB modulated with voice and then clipped. This\nresults in nearly constant amplitude transmission. In addition, the speech envelope is\ndetected and transmitted by an FM wave on a separate carrier. Thus, the technique utilizes\ntwo channels to transmit voice: one infinite-clipped SSB waveform of 3-kHz bandwidth and\na narrowband (400 Hz) carrier frequency modulated by the envelope of the voice waveform.\nThe speech is recovered by separately detecting the clipped SSB and the FM signals and\nmultiplying the two.\nThe FRENA technique appears to be a more efficient means of obtaining lower\nvalues of AI, with lower values of C / @, than with conventional modulation techniques,\nbut its performance at higher signal levels appears to be restricted to an AI of approximately\n0.56 (see fig. 45). The FRENA technique seems to suffer from two disadvantages: limited\nintelligibility and increased complexity of detection. FRENA is not able to compete at\nhigher AI values. Also, the implementation for detecting the FRENA signal would be\nrelatively complex due to the required combining of SSB and FM waveforms with the\nadditional requirement of a phase-lock loop for carrier tracking. Therefore, FRENA will\nnot be considered further.\n5.2.3 Digitized speech. - In this portion of the modulation discussion, digital\ntransmission and reception of speech is considered. This discussion is separated into the\nfollowing: (1) types of vocoders, (2) S/N versus bit error rates for the corresponding\nmodulation technique, and (3) a typical bit error rate versus intelligibility plot. For a\nrelative comparison, the AI versus C/@ plot is given in Sec. 5.3 for a digital vocoder. This\ndoes not imply that all vocoders are digital, but is just a typical representation of the digital\nvocoder characteristics.\n\n5.2.3.1: Vocoders (re$ 48): The digital transmission of unprocessed speech requires\napproximately 50 000 bits per second, which corresponds to an approximate sampling rate\nof 7000 samples per second with 7 bits per sample. The processing of speech allows substantial reduction in the transmitted bit rate. A typical bit rate obtainable for a 16-channel\nvocoder is approximately 2400 bits per second, where 47 samples per second are taken with\n3 bits per sample for 15 envelope channels and 6 bits per sample for the pitch channel; i.e.\n47( 15 x 3 + 6). The techniques available for processing speech digitally for transmission\n(vocoding) can be classified according to the method used for analyzing and synthesizing\nspeech or, in other words, according to the type of formating and reconstruction of the\ndigitized speech. The method of analyzing and synthesizing speech can be classified into the\nfollowing categories: spectrum channel vocoders, formant vocoders, pattern-matching\nvocoders, and correlation vocoders.\n\n119\n\nC @ Signal-to-noise density at aircraft receiver, dB-Hz\n/,\n\nFIGURE 45.- ARTICULATION INDEX VERSUS SIGNAL-TO-NOISE DENSITY (FRENA)\n\n120\n\nThe oldest method for speech analysis-synthesis, which employs a parametric\nrepresentation of the short-time speech spectrum (fig. 46), is the spectrum-channel vocoder.\nIn it, the spectral envelope IG(f, t)l is represented typically by sampling along the frequency\naxis, and the spectral fine structure I F(f, t)l measures the fundamental frequency of the voice\nsounds. A block diagram of a spectrum-channel vocoder is given in fig. 47. The speech signal\nis separated into 15 continuous spectral bands with bandwidths between 100 Hz and 400 Hz\ncovering 200 Hz to 3200 Hz. The summation of these 15 channels represents the envelope of\nthe short-time spectrum. In addition, there is a pitch detector that determines the fine\nstructure of the signal.\nAt the synthesizer, the original channel signals are recovered and utilized to control\nthe frequency response of a time-varying filter (consisting of modulators and narrowbandpass filters) to correspond to the spectral envelope measured at the analyzer. The input\nof this time-varying filter is supplied with a flat spectrum excitation signal of the proper\nspectral fine structure.\nFurther reduction of information transmitted for speech can be realized. Since\nspectral samples are significantly correlated, a linear transformation of channels into a smaller\nnumber of uncorrelated signals prior to transmission would reduce the information transferred.\nTwo methods of channel reduction have been tried with limited success: (1) transmission of\ncorrelated eigenvector signals, and (2) peak picking where only channel signals that are larger\nthan their neighbors are transmitted. The concept of channel reduction leads to the introduction of the formant vocoder.\nIn a formant vocoder (fig. 48), the analyzer attempts to determine the frequency\nlocation of the major formants (several prominent maxima). Signals corresponding to the\nformant locations are transmitted and utilized to control the resonances of a formant synthesizer, which consists of three or more single-tuned resonant circuits. For vowels excited\nexclusively at the vocal cords, the formant frequencies and bandwidth suffice to specify the\nentire spectral envelope. At the formant synthesizer, excellent quality of speech can be received with the properly supplied control signals. However, automatic extraction of sufficiently accurate control signals poses problems.\nPattern-matching vocoders attempt to match most accurately the short-time speech\nspectrum with a set of stored spectral patterns at a prescribed instant in time. A code\nrepresenting the best match is transmitted to the vocoder synthesizer, which produces the\nspeech signal with a selected spectrum. The crucial question is how many discrete patterns\nare required to represent an unlimited variety of speech spectra. Digital data rates for the\ntransmission of spectral patterns are estimated to be 500 bits per second, which corresponds\nto 1024 equi-probable spectral patterns at a sampling rate of 50 samples per second.\nThe autocorrelation function of a signal is the Fourier cosine transformation of its\npower spectrum, and vice versa. A similar relationship can be shown to hold for short-time\nspectra and autoconelation functions. Thus, a speech signal can be represented by a timevarying short-time autocorrelation function. This representation is the basis of autocorrelation\nvocoders. A block diagram of an autocorrelation vocoder is given in fig. 49. In the analyzer,\nan equalized speech signal is multiplied by itself and delayed by various amounts. The products are filtered to form correlation channel signals. Then, these time-varying signals\n(autocorrelation functions) are used to synthesize speech in the time domain.\n\n121\n\n50\n\nFrom\'ref. 48\nI\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\nFrequency, kHz\n\nFIGURE 46.- CHANNEL SPECTRUM REPRESENTATION\n\n122\n\nb\n.-\n\nN\n\nM\n5\nE\n\n2\nb\n\nU\n\n9\n\n>\n\n---- I- ---t\nI\nI\n\n_.----\n\nI-------+--I\n\nI\n\nE\n\ne\n\nu\n,\n\n123\n\nE\n0,\n\nLL\n\n124\n\nP\n\n125\n\nThe correlation vocoders described here suffer from two major disadvantages:\n( 1) their channel signals require larger bit rates than corresponding spectrum-channel\n\nvocoders; and (2) for the same quality of speech, the correlation vocoders require more\nchannels than the spectrum-channel vocoder.\n\n5.2.3.2 Bit error probabilities versus SIN: In fig. 50, bit error probabilities as a\nfunction of energy-to-noise-density ratio for various modulation techniques are given. The\nmodulation techniques represented are phase-shift keying (PSK), frequency-shift keying\n(FSK), and coherent-carrier keying. The PSK system theoretically provides optimum binary\ndetection by the properties of coherent detection and a signal correlation coefficient of\nminus one.\nFor a PCM/PSK/PM system with carrier tracking and data channels on separate\nsubcarriers, the output S/N for both the carrier and data channel will vary with the modulation index. Therefore, as the modulation index is decreased, the power available for data\nwill decrease and the corresponding bit error rate will increase. Thus, a tradeoff of power\ndivision should be made to satisfy system requirements (ref. 15).\n\n5.2.3.3 Word intelligibility versus bit error rate: Figure 5 1 gives the word intelligibility as a function of bit error rate for a Philco full-duplex, 16-channel vocoder reported at\nthe Globecom VI Conference in 1964. The information provided in figs. 50 and 5 1 will\nprovide the bases of the parametric representation in Sec. 5.3 of the selected modulation\ntechniques.\n5.3 Parametric Representation\nA parametric representation of three candidate modulation techniques is given in\nterms of AI versus the C/@. The three techniques are clipped SSB/SC, clipped NBFM, and\na digital 1&channel spectrum vocoder. The corresponding assumptions and representative\nequations for the parametric representation are presented,\n5.3.1 SSB/SC. - The following are representative for SSB/SC:\n(1 )\n\nrf clipping ratio resulting in a 6 dB peak-tmms ratio\n\n(2)\n\nFor a word intelligibility of 95% which corresponds to AI = 0.6, the required\n(S/N), is 14 dB in a 3-kHz bandwidth or 17 dB in a 6-kHz bandwidth\n(fig. 44):\n\n(C/N)i = 14 dB required (includes pilot carrier requirements)\n\n(3)\n\nrf bandwidth = 3 kHz (from Sec. 5.2.1.6)\n\n(4)\n\nTherefore,\n\n(C/@ ) = (34.75\n\n+ 14) dB-Hz = 48.75 dB-Hz (mean rf powe?)\n\n(C/@ ) = (34.75\n\n+ 20) dB-Hz = 54.75 dB-Hz (peak rf powera)\n\naLower C/@might be possible with pre-emphasis.\n\n126\n\n,127\n\n128\n\n5.3.2 Vocoder (PCM/PM).\n\n- The following are representative equations for PCM/PM:\n\n(1)\n\nFor AI = 0.6, the corresponding BER = lom4(fig. 51)\n\n(2)\n\nData channel:\nBER =\n\ncorresponds to realizable ST/(N/B) = 10.0 dBa\n\nBit rate = 2400 bps\n\n= 33.8 dB\n\nModulation loss ( C = 1.8 rad)\n\n= 1.6 dB\n\nC/@=45.4 dB-Hz\n(3)\n\nCarrier channel:\nCarrier tracking loop BW (50 Hz)\n\n= 17.0 dB\n\nSNR threshold in 50 Hz\n\n= 9.0 dB\n\nModulation loss ( @ = 1.8 rad)\n\n= 9.4dB\n\nC/* = 34.5 dB-Hz\n\n(4)\n\nTherefore,\n\n(C/@) = 45.4 dB-Hz\n5.3.3 NBFM. - In calculating the voice output S/N required for FM, it is convenient\nto use a full-load test tone in place of speech as the modulating signal. Therefore, with a\nspeech peak-to-rms factor of 6 dB after clipping, a tone with the same peak power has a 3-dB\nhigher average power. Thus, if a system is required t o provide a 14-dB rms speech-to-noise\nratio in a 3-kHz bandwidth, a 17dB full-load rms tone-to-noise-power ratio is required:\n(1)\n\nAudio clipping - 6 dB peak-to-rms ratio at the input to the modulator\n\n(2)\n\nFor a word intelligibility of 95%, which corresponds to AI = 0.6, the\nrequired S/N = 17 dB (fig. 44) in a 3-kHz bandwidth for a full load tone:\n\nwhere\n\nfm = audio baseband\nAfp\n\n2%\n\n= k(Af )\n\n(the peak deviation)\n\naIncludes allowance for hardware degradation\n\n129\n\nk2\n\n= peak-to-rms ratio\n\nBi,f, = i.f. bandwidth\n\nFor a peak deviation of 3.2 kHz, the corresponding rms deviation is 1.6 kHz\nat a 6-dB peak-to-rms ratio, and the necessary (C/N)isf. required is 9 dB; i.e.,\nsolving eq.

The method used in calculating (%WI) versus C/@ is outlined\nin Secs. 5.3.1 through 5.3.3. The required C/@,\'snecessary to meet a %WI of 95,90,84,70,\nand 42 were determined and then these values were mapped into the corresponding AI values\nvia fig. 27. It is acknowledged that this method is less rigorous than that outlined in Sec. 5.2.2.5\nfor determining AI; but the results are sufficiently close to be acceptable.\n\na\n\nThis recommended C/@is near optimum from both bandwidth and C/N\n. considerations, permitting minimum rf bandwidth as well as adequate C/N\n\nfor phase-lock demodulator operation.

If experimental results verify their analysis for an\naircraft-satellite communication, the performance margin given in the link calculation will\nincrease by 4 dB.\n5.4 Summary and Recommendations\nA voice modulation analysis was performed and the results are shown in fig. 52. The\nchoice of a modulation technique greatly affects the communications performance. To\nassure a reliable surveillance/communication system, a rather good percent word intelligibility\nof 95% (AI = 0.6) was selected for the nominal design operating point. For this operating point,\nwas\nthe required received carrier-to-noise-density ratio C/@, calculated for the three most desirable modulation techniques (SSB, NBFM, and digitized speech).\nIf the sole criterion is maintaining a minimum C/4, based on the assumption that a\nsatellite is peak-power-limited versus average power-limited, then the most desirable modulation technique is digitized speech, followed by NBFM and SSB. In addition, digitized speech\nprovides added security not available in NBFM or SSB. However, based on the equipment\ncost and airline maintainability, NBFM and SSB have an advantage over the digital technique\nFurthermore, for a civil application, security is not of prime importance. Of the two modulation techniques left, NBFM and SSB, SSB requires more peak power than FM, and the present\npeak-power-limited spacecraft amplifiers would not be suitable for efficient linear operation\nwith an SSB signal. Therefore, a NBFM modulation technique is recommended with the\nfollowing characteristics:\n\n. . . .\nrf bandwidth\n. . . .\nThreshold C/4 . . . .\nPeak frequency deviation .\nAudio clipping . . . .\nVoice baseband\n\n132\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n200 .\n3200 Hz\n13.0 kHz\n\n50.0 dB-Hz\nk 3.2\n\nkHz\n\nSuch that a 6 dB peak-to-rms\nratio exists at the input to\nthe modulator\n\n6.0 PRQPAGATIQN\n\nThe radio propagation media between the airplane terminal and the satellite will\nsignificantly influence the operational performance of the aeronautical satellite system.\nFigure 53 illustrates a typical propagation mode between an airborne terminal and a satellite.\nAs is shown, the direct propagation path between the airplane teminal and the satellite\nincludes the troposphere, the ionosphere, and free space, In addition to the direct path a\nsecond propagation path exists because of reflection from the earth\xe2\x80\x99s surface. Thus, there\nmay be multipath interference between signals propagated via the direct and reflected paths.\nThe purpose of this section of the report is to evaluate the effect of the various\npropagation media in detail and to determine the resultant impact upon overall system\nperformance.\nQuantitative predictions of the various propagation effects are based largely on\ntheoretical models that describe the mechanism involved and that at the same time lend\nthemselves to mathematical treatment. These models are described in detail in the first\nportion of the study. The models described include the general propagation model, the\nsystem geometry model, the ionospheric model, the tropospheric model, the ocean surface\nmodel, and the antenna radiation pattern model used in the study.\nThe second portion of the propagation study presents a detailed evaluation of\nvarious propagation effects that result when the propagation models are applied to the wide\nrange of environmental parameters likely to be encountered in system operation.\nThe third portion of the study is devoted to determining the overall impact of\npropagation upon system operational performance.\n6.1 Propagation Model Development\n6.1.1 The general model. - With the advent of highly sophisticated aircraft communication and navigation systems it has become important to predict accurately and\nefficiently the detailed effects of the medium upon the propagated signal. Because the\nmedium-which, in general, consists of the troposphere, free space, and the ionosphere-is\nnonhomogeneous and nonisotropic, it is desirable t o have a prediction routine capable of\nperforming a three-dimensional ray trace and analysis of the propagation phenomena. The\nprogram described has the capability and the necessary mathematical sophistication to enable\nprediction of the behavior of electromagnetic wave propagation under severely abnormal\natmospheric conditions.\nThe program, which is based upon work by the Institute for Telecommunication\nSciences (ITS) (ref. SO), uses Hamiltonian optics to yield the necessary ray-tracing differential\nequations. These ray-tracing equations are used in conjunction with a three-part exponential for the tropospheric index of refraction and the Appleton-Hartree equation for the\nindex of refraction in the ionosphere to calculate the ray path taken by the wave as it\npropagates through the medium. In addition to predicting the three-dimensional ray path,\nthe program can also determine the following propagation effects upon the electromagnetic\nwave: Faraday rotation, Doppler shift, absorption, group path, phase path, and group path\ndelay. A flow diagram of the propagation analysis is presented in fig. 54.\n\n133\n\nSatellite\n\n,\n\nR\n(Pirplane terminal\nTroposphere\n\nOcean surface\n\nFIGURE 53.- AERONAUTICAL SATELLITE SYSTEM PROPAGATION MODE DIAGRAM\n\n134\n\nInputs:\nLocation\nSSN\n\nMonth\nTime\nFrequency\nBandwidth\n\nLocation\n\nMonth\n\n.\n\nAntenna\nradiation\npattern\ndata\n\nLocation\nMonth\n\nAirplane altitude\nSubsatel I t e point\ni\nSatellite altitude\nor\nSystem geometry\n\nSatellite\nephemeris\n\nRequired system\nfade margin\n\n3\n.\nAirplane location\nAirplane heading\n\nFree-space path\n\nloss\n\nor\n\n4\n.\n\nTotal group\ndelay\n\nE n d points of\ngreat-circle route\n\n5.\n\nDifferential\ngroup delay\n\n6.\n\nMultipathdelay\n\nNumber of r o u t e\nincrements\n\n-\n\n*7.\n\nDoppler\n\n\'8.\n\nGrade of service\n\nReceived signal\npolarization\n\n*Not used in this study\n\nFIGURE 54.- PROPAGATION ANAL YSlS FLOW DIAGRAM\n\n135\n\nThe path taken by an electromagnetic wave as it propagates through an anisotropic\nmedium, such as the ionosphere, is most conveniently and accurately determined by using\na set of differential equations relating the coordinates of a point on the ray path. These\nequations can be derived from Hamiltonian optics using Fermat\'s principle of stationary time.\nThe following equations have been derived in this manner, and they are used exclusively by\nthe prediction routine to determine the ray path:\n\nwhere\nr = spherical polar coordinate of a point on the ray path\n0 = spherical polar coordinate of a point on the ray path\n\n9 = spherical polar coordinate of a point on the ray path\np = real part of the phase refractive index of the medium\n\nP\'= real part of the group refractive index of the medium\n\n- = a vector, directed normal to the phase front of the ray, of magnitude p\nQ\n\nwith or, u , and\nrespective y\n\nP\n\n09 ,.its coordinates in the r, e ,and @ direction,\n\ny = group path length (the independent variable)\n\no = angular frequency\n\n136\n\nThe above set of first-order partial differential equations are solved numerically to give the\nlocus of the ray as it traverses through the medium which is characterized by its p and p\'\nparameters. The ray-tracing procedure is carried out by applying the initial conditions\n(Le., height of transmitter, azimuth angle of transmission, and elevation angle of transmission)\nto the differential equations and then using an Adams-Moulton method with a Runge-Kutta\nstarter (ref. 5 1) to perform the numerical solution of the differential equations.\n\nIn addition to the six basic equations necessary to calculate the ray path, the\nprogram also simultaneously integrates several other differential equations that supply the\nfollowing effects of the medium upon the propagating wave: phase path length, absorption,\nand the change in the group path length introduced by presence of the medium. The following relationships were used to determine these effects:\n\ndAL\n--\n\np\'-1\n- -\n\nd\nY\n\nP\'\n\nwhere\ny = group path length (the independent variable)\n\nP = phase path length\nA = absorption\nf = frequency of the propagating wave\nc = speed of light\nAL = change in group path length\nX = imaginary part of the phase refractive index\n\nError analysis calculations require that the bending delay (path length difference\nbetween the actual ray path and the line-of-sight ray path between the transmitter and\nreceiver) be determined. This parameter was calculated by subtracting the change in group\npath length A L and the line-of-sight distance between the transmitter and receiver r\n[eq. (73)] from the total group path length y.\nFor earth-satellite propagation paths, the medium consists of free space, the\ntroposphere, and the ionosphere. For free space p = P\' = .1 and X = 0. In the troposphere,\nwhich is nondispersive (i.e. p = p\' ), X = 0 and p is obtained through an analysis\n\n137\n\nprocedure as discussed in Sec. 6.1.3.

Thus, the system geometry must receive primary consideration in the\ndevelopment of the aeronautical L-band satellite communication terminal. A computer\nprogram developed by Boeing was used to calculate the basic geometric parameters\nrequired for this study. In addition, this program calculates the divergence factor and the\nsmooth-earth reflection coefficient.\nA diagram of the system geometry is shown in fig. 55.\n\n138\n\nY\n\nFIGURE 5 .

At frequencies large compared to the ionospheric penetration frequency, which is seldom greater than 10 MHz, it is well known that the electron density\nplays by far the most significant role of the three geomagnetic quantities cited above. For\nthis reason, the models used to represent the earth\xe2\x80\x99s magnetic field and the collision frequency\nof electrons in the ionosphere are described briefly at the eqd of this section, whereas the\nmajority of this section is devoted to the description of the ionosphere electron density\nprofile model.\nExperimental observations indicate that the mean electron density of the ionosphere\nis represented quite closely by parabolic profiles for the E, F1, and F2 layers and an\nexponential decrease above the F2 layer (ref. 55). The accuracy with which these predicted\nprofiles represent the actual profiles depends directly upon how much data are available on\nthe individual layers. The E and F1 layers are quite stable and over the past years semiempirical relationships have been derived to obtain the necessary parameters for the evaluation of their parabolic profiles. The F2 layer is by far the most significant of the ionospheric\nlayers; however, unlike the E and F1 layers, it is very unstable and varies over wide ranges\nwith respect to geographic location, sunspot number, time of day, and season. Hence, it is\nnecessary to use data that are stored on a worldwide basis to evaluate the parameters that\ndetermine the F2 layer profile. Such data are available on a long-term basis or on a shortterm basis (up to 3 months in advance) from the Institute for Telecommunication\nSciences (ITS) (ref. 56).\nThe general equation for the E, F l yand F2 parabolas is (ref. 57):\n\nwhere\nnthly media of the hourly mean electron density, electron/cc\nh = height, km\nhm\n\n= height of the max\n\n145\n\n1.o\n\n0.9\n\n08\n.\n\n0.7\n\nn\n\n0.6\n\ni\n\n8\n0\n4\n?\n0)\n\n0\nC\n\ng,\n\n0.5\n\nE\n\ni3\n0.4\n\n03\n.\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n0\nGrazing angle of incident wave, deg\n\n146\n\nFIGURE 57.- DIVERGENCE FACTOR ASA FUNCTION OF INCIDENT WAVE GRAZING ANGLE\nFOR AN AIRPLANE AT70000-FTALTITUDEAND A SATELLITEAT\nSYNCHRONOUS ALTITUDE\n\nNmax = maximum electron density of the layer, electrons/cc\nHs = layer quarter thickness (at h = hmax & Hs, the electron density\nequals 0.75 Nmax), km\nThe above equation for N(h) may be further simplified using the following\nrelationship:\n= \xe2\x82\xacOm\n-\n\nNmax\n\ne2\n\nfo2 = 12 400 fo2\n\n(87)\n\nwhere\n\nfo = critical frequency of particular layer, MHz\neo = permittivity of free space\n\nm = mass of electron\ne = charge of an electron\nHence:\na\n\nN(h) = 12400 fo2\n\n[ - ( - ~]\n1\n\nh hmax\n2Hs\n\n6.1.3.I E-layer profile parameters: From ionosonde recordings the E-layer profile\nparameters (fo, hmax, Hs) have been obtained to a high degree of accuracy.

Results to date indicate\nthat the electron density does not fall off very rapidly above the F2 layer peak and that the\nprofile is represented quite closely by an exponential decay. For heights greater than\nhmax F2 + HsF2 the following relationship is used to obtain the N(h) profile:\n\nN(h) = 3/4Nmaxexp\n\n148\n\n1\n\nwhere\nNmax = maximum electron density of F2 layer, electrons/cc\nb a x F 2 = height of maximum electron density of F2 layer, km\nHsF2 = quarter thickness of the F2 layer, km\n\n6.1.3.5 Model of the earth\xe2\x80\x99s magnetic field in the ionosphere: The earth\xe2\x80\x99s magnetic\nfield was assumed to be adequately represented by an earth-centered dipole model (ref. 50).\nThis model is represented by the following mathematical relationship:\n1\n\nRo+h\n\nr\n\n= tan-\xe2\x80\x99 12 cot\n\n( l + 3 c o s2 A\n\nAI\n\n)Z\n\n(93)\n(94)\n\nwhere\n\nIH I = magnitude of earth\xe2\x80\x99s magnetic field\n\nHo = surface magnitude of earth\xe2\x80\x99s magnetic field at equator\nh = height above ground\nRo = radius of earth\nA = geomagnetic colatitude\n\nr=\n\nmagnetic dip angle\n\n6.1.3.6 Collision frequency model: The graphical relationship shown in fig. 58 was\nused to determine the collision frequency of free electrons in the ionosphere (ref, 59).\n\n6.1.3.7 Model electron density profile: Two model electron density profiles were\ndeveloped to illustrate the typical summer and winter ionospheric conditions over the North\nAtlantic Ocean during a sunspot maximum.\n\nThe smoothed sunspot number (SSN) of 130 was selected as the highest degree of\nsolar activity likely to be encountered in the next several decades. While much higher SSN\nvalues have been recorded in the past, such as during Cycle 19 during which an SSN value of\nover 200 was recorded in 1957, the present period in the long-term 87-year cycle indicates\nthat peak SSN values for the next several decades will not exceed 130. For example, the\npresent cycle is expected to have a peak SSN of only 110, which will occur during 1968.\nLocal noon was selected as being representative of the maximum electron density\nencountered diurnally.\n\n149\n\nE\n\nY\n\nCollision frequency, radians/sec\n\nFIGURE 58.- COLLISION FREQUENCY MODEL\n\n150\n\nAn ionospheric penetration point of latitude 50" north, longitude 50" west, was\nselected as being typical for a North Atlantic air route.\nBased upon the above assumption, the following parameters were derived to\ndescribe the profile (figs. 59 and 60):\nfoE\n\n= 2.73 MHz\n\nHsF2 = 51 km\n\nfoFl\n\n= 4.35MHz\n\n%E\n\nfoF2\n\n= 11.95 MHz\n\nhmF1 = 200 km\n\nHsE\n\nWinter (December)\n\n= 10 km\n\nhmF2 = 294km\n\nHsF1 = 35km\nfoE\n\n= 5.40 MHz\n\nfoF2\n\n= 6.89 MHz\n\nHsE\n\nM(3OOO)F2 = 3.16\n\n= 3.88 MHz\n\nfoFl\n\nSummer (July)\n\n= 110km\n\n= 10km\n\nHsF1 = 50km\nHsF2 = 96km\n%E\n\n= llOkm\n\nhmF1 = 200 km\n%F2\n\n= 384km\n\nM(3000)F2 = 2.65\nThe resulting winter and summer electron density profiles are shown in figs. 59 and\n60. The winter electron density shown in fig. 59 was used to calculate ionospheric effects\nin the overall link performance analysis, since the winter ionization level is significantly\nhigher than that predicted for the summer season.\n6.1.4 The troposphere model. - The analysis of tropospheric effects was based upon\na three-part exponential model of the radio refractivity of the atmosphere as a function of\nheight N\'(h) . Separate exponential terms are calculated for the water vapor term, the\ndensity term in the troposphere, and the density term in the stratosphere. The parameters\nused to represent this N\'(h) model were obtained from seasonal maps published by the\nEnvironmental Sciences Services Administration (ESSA) (ref. 60). The seasonal maps present\n\nI\n\n151\n\nh\n\nm\n\nN\n\n152\n\n153\n\nworldwide sea-level values of surface water vapor and density terms, the scale heights of the\nthree exponential terms, and the transition height between the tropospheric and stratospheric density exponentials.\n\n6.1.4.1 The calculation o f the atmospheric radio refractivity profile: The equations\nused to calculate the complete atmospheric radio refractivity profile are:\nN\'(h) =\n\nfor h c ht\n\nEo exp\n\n(-k)+ go (-$)\nexp\n\n(95)\n\nfor h > ht\n\n= radio refractivity of the atmosphere at a height h\n= mean sea-level value of dry term\n\n= mean sea-level value of wet term\n= wet-term scale height\n= tropospheric dry-term scale height\n= stratospheric dry-term scale height\n= altitude above mean sea level of the point of transition between tropospheric\n\nand stratospheric dry-term exponentials\nThe calculated N\'(h) profile is converted into a phase refractive index p profile,\nusing the relationship:\np = 1 + N\'(h)Ix 10-6\n\n(97)\n\nwhen used in conjunction with the general propagation model described in Sec. 6.1.\nThe parameters used to calculate the atmospheric radio refractivity profile for the\nmonth of November in the North Atlantic Ocean are as follows:\n\nDO\nH1\n\n154\n\n= 285\n\n= 9.0 km\n\nmargin required. Thus, the Limiting situation insofar as the system operation is concerned is\nthe frequency of occurrence of relatively smooth sea conditions.\nThe selection of a model for the surface of the ocean is complicated by the lack of\ninformation of the type required for detailed analysis of the rough surface reflection\ncharacteristics of ocean waves.\nIndividual sea waves are shaped like mountains with sharp angular tops. The\nindividual crests are not usually lined up in the same direction, and there are generally\nsystems of small waves superimposed upon larger waves.\nWave recording instruments have been developed that graphically indicate wave\nheight at sea. These devices indicate that the distribution of wave heights varies in a random\nand unpredictable fashion, even on the same wave record.\nSirice by far the greatest amount of data available on the distribution of ocean wave\nheight is from visual observations, it is obvious that much of the available data is rather\nqualitative. However, studies are in progress to better define the statistical properties of\nwaves, and an attempt is being made to define ocean wave characteristics in a consistent and\nlogical manner.\n6.1.5.1 Ocean\'surface model development: The ocean surface model development\nis based primarily upon data available from the U.S. Naval Oceanographic office regarding\nthe statistical distribution of observed wave heights in the North Atlantic Ocean (ref. 6 1).\nOther information utilized includes data published by the U.S. Hydrographic Office\n(ref. 62) regarding the observation and forecasting of ocean waves. Ocean waves are generally\ncategorized in terms of a parameter called sea state in accordance with their range of\n\nthe North Atlantic\n\n155\n\n1000\n\n100\n\n10\n\n0\n\nDURING THE MONTH OF NOVEMBER\n\n156\n\nTABLE 14.-SEA-STATE CHARACTERISTICS\nObserved\nwave height,\nft\n\nSea\nstate\n\nStandard\ndeviation,\nft\n\nDescription\n\n0.125\n\nCalm\n\n0.5 to 1\n\n0.25\n\nSmooth\n\n1to3\n\n0.75\n\nSlight\n\n3 to 5\n\n1.25\n\nModerate\n\n5 to 8\n\n2\n\nRough\n\n8 t o 12\n\n3\n\nVery rough\n\n12 to 20\n\n5\n\nHigh\n\n20 to 40\n\n10\n\nVery high\n\n40+\n\n10.0 +\n\nPrecipitous\n\n0 to 0.5\n\nTABLE 15.4EA-STATE STATISTICS\n\nSea state\n\nPercent time of\noccurrence\n\n0\n\n1.7\n\n1 to 2\n\n37.4\n\n3\n\n20.3\n\n4\n\n17.2\n\n5\n\n11.8\n\n6 to 8\n\n11.6\n\n157\n\nminimum disc\ndirection.

Both\nthe direct wave and the reflected wave were considered, and the effects of the ionosphere,\ntroposphere, ocean surface, and antenna radiation pattern characteristics were evaluated.\nIn addition, the resultant fade margin requirements for the system were determined based\nupon the cumulative effect of the various propagation media and mechanisms involved.\n6.2.1 Ionospheric effects. - An investigation was performed to determine\nionospherically induced attenuation, group delay, and differential group delay on a 1620MHz signal propagating through the ionosphere. The general propagation model described\nin Sec. 6.1 was used as a basis for the analyses. The ionospheric model selected was\nrepresentative of the highest ionization level likely to be encountered in the North Atlantic\narea. The model was representative of a winter noon ionosphere with a smoothed sunspot\nnumber of 130.\nThe effects of the ionosphere were found to be minor with regard to system\nation as a function of elevation angle\nattenuation of the 1620-MHz signal\n\ning delay accounts for the delay\n\n158\n\n159\n\n90\n\n80\n\n70\n\n60\n\n50\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n-10\n\n-20\n\n-30\n\n-40\n\nElevation angle, deg\n\nFIGURE 63.-MAXIMUM RELATIVE ANTENNA RADIATION PATTERN GAIN AS A\nFUNCTION OF ELEVATION ANGLE FOR HORIZONTAL POLARIZATION\n\n160\n\n.. ..\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n*\n\nI\nn\n\n..\n.\n\n..\n\n.\n\n.\n.\n\n.\n\n0\nd\n\nI\nn\n\nm\n\n--\n\n.-\n\n0\n0\n\ntF!\n\nz\n\nI\nn\n\nx\n8\n8\n\n0\n0\n\n8\n\n0\n\nH\n8\n\n:\n8\n0\n\nco\n\nQ\n\n8\n\nbo\n\n8\n\n9\n.\n0\n\n161\n\n._ _. . . . . .\n...\n\n-\n\n- .. -\n\nj\n\n1\n\n3\n\nn\n\ni\n\ni\n\n- -\n\n.........\n\ni\n\n!\n\n. -\n\nI1 -\n\nI-\n\nI\n\ni\n\nII\n\nI1\n:\n\n1\n\n0\n\nN\n\nI\n\n.\n.\n\n+\n\ni..\nL-\n\n.\n-\n\ni\n\n52\nI\n\n.......\n\n;\n\nI\n\n. ..__\n.\n\nI\n\n.\n\nI\n\n0\n0\nN\n\n162\n\ns!\n\n0\n\n163\n\nSince the ionosphere is a dispersive medium, the group delay will vary across the\nsystem bandwidth. The term "differential group delay" defines the difference between the\ngroup delay at the upper and lower edges of the system bandwidth. Differential group delay\nwas calculated for a 20-kHz bandwidth centered on 1620 MHz. The maximum value of\nseconds for all elevation\ndifferential group delay was determined to be less than 1.2 x\nangles above 5". Figure 67 shows differential group delay as a function of elevation angle.\nThe electron density distribution of the ionosphere is not stationary, but is constantly\nundergoing short-term variation; therefore, a signal propagating through the ionosphere will\nexhibit amplitude scintillation.\nFew experimental data are available regarding scintillation effects at .I 620 MHz.\nHowever, an empirical equation has been developed at Boeing (ref. 64) that predicts\n.\nscintillation effects; this equation shows excellent agreement with available experimental\ndata (ref. 65). The equation determines scintillation index S as a function of subionospheric\ngeomagnetic latitude @SM , time of day T, smoothed sunspot number Rz, wavelength of\nthe propagating wave X , and ionospheric zenith angle i.\nThe equation is:\nS=0.73 [ l - exp(-DLR,A 2I s e c i ]\n\n(98)\n\nwhere\n\nL = L *sM), an empirical latitude variation factor from fig. 68\n(\nD = D(T), an empirical diurnal variation factor from fig. 69\nS = rms variation in signal power divided by average signal power (scintillation\nindex)\nThe scintillation index was calculated for a 1620-MHz signal using the parameters\ndefined by the winter ionosphere model described in Sec. 6.1.3 (geomagnetic latitude 60"N,\nand zenith angle 73") and the resultant fade depth determined. These parameters represent\nthe highest level of ionospheric activity likely to occur during system operation. The resultant\nfade depth was found to be less than 0.5 dB 99% of the time, assuming a Rayleigh distribution\nof fading amplitude.\n6.2.2 Tropospheric effects. - The effects of the troposphere upon the 1620-MHz\nsignal were investigated using the general propagation model described in Sec. 6.1.1 ,in\nconjunction with the tropospheric refractive index profile described in Sec. 6.1.3.\nAt 70 000 feet the refractive index n of the troposphere exceeds unity by only\n[fig. 61 and eq. (loo)] ,and is decreasing exponentially. Therefore, the effect of\nthe troposphere upon the direct wave from the satellite was assumed to be completely\nnegligible. Trial calculations using the general propagation model indicated that this assumption was valid, since the total group delay in the troposphere was calculated to be less than\n1 foot at any elevation angle above 5 O .\n\n2x\n\nFor the reflected signal component, which must traverse the troposphere twice\nbetween the satellite and the airplane terminal, the total group delay was found to be less\nthan 60 feet at all elevation angles above 1Oo .\n\n164\n\n..\n.\n\n..\n\nI\nn\n\n0\n0\n\n165\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n4\n0\n50\nSubionospheric *mag\n\n60\n\n70\nde9\n\n80\n\n90\n\nFIGURE 68.-LATITUDE VARIATION FACTOR AS A FUNCTION OF THE\nSUBIONOSPHERIC GEOMAGNETIC LA TITUDE\n\n166\n\nTime of day, T\n\nFIGURE 69.-DIURNAL VARIATION FACTOR ASA FUNCTION OF TIME OF DAY\nFOR GEOMAGNETIC LATITUDES LESS THAN 63\'\n\n167\n\n6.2.3 Multipath. - The performance of an aeronautical satellite communication\nsystem may be affected \xe2\x80\x98significantly by interference between the direct and earth-reflected\nradio wave received from the satellite by the airborne terminal. The amount of multipath\ninterference depends on the intensity and phase of the earth-reflected signal relative to that\nof the direct ray. For the smooth-earth case, the reflected signal will be specular and have a\nmagnitude and phase angle that are a function of the system geometry and the conductivity\nand dielectric constant of the earth. However, if the surface of the earth is sufficiently rough,\nthe reflected wave will be scattered by surface irregularities, and diffuse reflection will occur.\nFigure 70 shows a typical system geometry where an airborne terminal T at\nheight h receives a signal from a satellite S.\nThe signal from the satellite is received at the airplane by the direct path S to T\nand by the indirect path S to R to T, where R defines the point of specular reflection\nfrom the surface of the earth. The ratio of the field intensities along the direct and indirect\npaths is defined as\n\nwhere <Ei> is the rms value of the indirect wave field intensity and Ed is the direct wave\nfield intensity.\nDepending on the surface roughness the reflected wave may be categorized as\nfollows (ref. 66):\n(1)\n\nSpecular (coherent) for smooth surfaces\n\n(2)\n\nDiffuse (incoherent) for rough surfaces\n\n(3)\n\nSpecular plus diffuse for moderately rough surfaces\n\nThe relative roughness of the surface may be defined in terms of a roughness\nfactor g that is proportional to Q /A ,where a is the standard deviation of the surface\namplitude and h is the wavelength of the signal. When g = 0, the reflected wave will be\nspecular. When 0 < g << 1, the reflected wave will be primarily specular, whereas for\ng >> 1 the specular term is negligible, and the reflected signal will be primarily random. The\ncorrelation distance T is the distance between two points on the random surface where the\ncorrelation between them is e-l. Thus, large values of T indicate large distances between\nsurface peaks and valleys and correspondingly reduced surface slopes.\n\n6.2.3.1 Specular reflection: The specular component of the reflected field is\nsimilar to that which would be obtained from a smooth surface. Specular reflection is\nproduced within the first Fresnel zone regio nd will have the same phase as if the\nreflecting surface were perfectly smooth. H ever, the magnitude of the specular reflection\ncoefficient will be less than that for a perfectly smooth surface and will fluctuate.\nThe mean square value of the reflection coefficient < IRs I > for specular reflection\nis given by:\n\n168\n\nFIGURE 7O,-TY?ICAL SYST\xe2\x82\xacM GEOMETRY\n\n169\n\nwhere\n\nR\n\n=\n\nD\n\n= divergence factor resulting from curved earth surface\n\nc IPSl2 >\n\nreflection coefficient for a smooth surface\n\n= mean-square value of the specular scattering coefficient\n\nThe specular scattering coefficient P s is the ratio of the field from a perfectly\nconducting rough surface to that which would be obtained from a perfectly conducting\nsmooth surface. The specular reflection coefficient Rs is the ratio of the field from a rough\nsurface to the incident field.\nThe mean-square value of the specular scattering coefficient is:\n\nwhere\n*Q = phase constant of the surface\n\nU =\n\nstandard deviation of surface amplitude distribution\n\nY = grazing angle\nh = wavelength of incident wave\n\n6.2.3.2 Diffuse scattering: Current analyses that have been performed (refs. 66\nthrough 69) to evaluate the forward-scattering characteristic of rough terrain have assumed\nthat: (1) terrain surface undulations can be described by a two-dimensional Gaussian\ndistribution; (2) the autocorrelation function of the surface undulations is Gaussian,\nhaving the form C( T ) = e-\n\n(+r\n\n; (3)\n\n(T\n\nT; is fairly small; and (4)\n\na\n\nis fairly large.\n\nThe scattering surface is divided into elements, each of which may be assumed to act\nas a small mirror that reflects the incident wave in accordance with the laws of geometric\noptics. Each element is sufficiently small and sufficiently distant from the transmitter so\nthat the grazing angle is essentially constant over the element surface.\nIn this case the average scattered power ( < Ps > ) from the entire surface is found by\nintegrating the average power (Po) reflected from each elementary surface area:\n\nwhere a is the radius of the earth and (a, 6 ,9 ) are the spherical coordinates of a surface\nelement .\n\n170\n\nThe general configuration of the scattering geometry is shown in fig. 71.\nIn fig. 71, the following nomenclature is used:\n\ns\n\n=\n\nsatellite terminal\n\nT\n\n=\n\nairplane terminal\n\nR\n\n=\n\nreflection point\n\n01 = reflection angle at reflection point\n02 = incident angle at reflection point\n\ne\n\n=\n\nspherical coordinate angle with the Z axis\n\nh\n\n=\n\nairplane altitude\n\nr\n\n=\n\nslant range between satellite and airplane\n\nrl\n\n= slant range between airplane and reflection point\n\nr2\n\n= slant range between satellite and reflection point\n\na\n\n=\n\n90" complement of the satellite elevation angle at the airplane\n\nY\n\n=\n\nelevation angle of satellite at reflection point\n\n@\n\n= azimuth angle of satellite with the XZ plane at reflection point\n= radius of the earth\n\na\n\nPrevious studies (ref. 54) have shown that the mean-square value of the reflection\ncoefficient ( b R1) of a terrain surface element (d S) is given by:\n\nwhere\n\nP. = angle made by the bisector of angle TRS with the Z axis\n(\nI\nPo = tan 7\n\n0\n\n= standard deviation of terrain height\n\nT\n\n= autocorrelation distance of terrain height\n\nr2\n\n= distance from surface element to receiver\n\n17 1\n\nFIGURE 71.-TYPICA L SCA TTERING GEOMETRY\n\n172\n\nThus, tan p is interpreted as a mean value of the ratio of the vertical and horizontal\ndimensions of the surface irregularities. The reflection coefficient 6 R 1 is defined as the\nratio of the reflected field to the incident field on the reflecting surface.\nIf 6R is defined as the ratio of the reflected field to the incident field received at\nthe receiver, then\n\nwhere r is the distance from the transmitter to the receiver and r l is the distance from the\ntransmitter to the reflecting surface.\nCombining eq. (103) and (104), the relationship\n\nis obtained; therefore:\n\nfor each incremental surface area.\nIf a ratio k for diffuse reflection is defined as\n\nwhere e E,> is the mean value of field intensity reflected from the elementary surface area\nand Ed is the direct wave field intensity, then integrating eq.

(109) was expanded\ninto a Taylor\'s series up to and hcluding the squared terms around the specular point\n(0 = Os, Q> = 0). The result is:\nt m 2 p = 2 tan2(8\n4\n\n- 6,) + M(O - es)2\n\n(1 10)\n\nwhere\nM=l+\n\nH2\n1\n2(H*+ H e s 2 ) ~ [ H 2 + ( 1 H ) e S ] 2\n+\n\nand\n\nThis is quite a reasonable approximation since the quantity exp\n\nts)\n\n(-\n\nis\n\ndecreasing faster than l/c0s4p is increasing, and the product is tending toward zero. Thus,\nmost of the scattered power originates around the specular point.\n\nEquation (108) was integrated using the method of steepest descent, as described by\nDurrani and Staras (ref. 67), and by means of a highly accurate numerical integration method\nusing the CDC 6600 computer.

The calculations do not\ninclude the effect of multiple reflections, diffraction, and scattering that would result in an\nerror. However, it appears tha\nprimary source of error in the anal\nof a Gaussian autocorrelation\ntion for the ocean surface (ref.\nindicated that the autocorrelation of the ocean surface fluctuation\nthan Gaussian, and is nonisotropic (ref. 7 1).\nIn view of the discrepancy between theory and experiment, and the lack of adequate\ninformation regarding the autocorrelation of the ocean surface, experimentally derived data\nare used to predict both the specular and diffuse components of the reflected wave.\nPerhaps the most rigorous experimental investigations of forward scattering from the\nsurface of the ocean have been performed by Beard (refs. 7 1 and 72). These include overocean measurements performed in the Golden Gate and the Gulf of Mexico areas as well as\na very detailed series of laboratory experiments. The latter experiments were scale-model\nmeasurements of both the coherent and incoherent components of microwave (2.83 cm)\nenergy reflected from the surface of water in a large tank. The water contained in the tank\nwas perturbed by injecting air into the tank in the region beyond the illuminated area. By\nvarying the air injection rate the standard deviation of the water surface height could be\nvaried. The grazing angle of the illuminating signal was held constant at 22.9", and the\ndeviation angle of the water surface as well as the beamwidth of the transmitting antenna\nwere variable. A phase-lock technique was used to separate the coherent and incoherent\ncomponents of the reflected signal from the direct wave. The surface conductivity was\nscaled to the frequency of operation.\nThe correlation envelope of the water surface fluctuation was measured and found to\nbe highly anisotropic; that is, the correlation distance perpendicular to the direction of wave\nmotion is much larger than in the direction of wave motion.

The diffuse component of the reflected wave has a random phase such\nthat for every point in space any phase of the reflected wave may occur with equal probability. Therefore, in the case of diffuse reflection, the phase of the reflected wave will vary\nrandomly as the receiver is moved with respect to the transmitter. Thus, the total received\nsignal may be represented by three components as shown below:\n\nwhere\n5\n\nEt\n\n= resultant received field\n\nEd = field received directly from transmitter\n-)\n.\n\n-\n\nE,\n\n= specular or coherent component of reflected field\n\nE,\n\n= diffuse or incoherent component of reflected field\n\nThe specular reflection coefficient Rs was determined from the following equation:\n\nwhere\nC\n\n= upper limit of normalized coherent field component amplitude obtained\nfrom fig. 73\n\nD = divergence factor obtained from eq.

( 113) is quite conservative, since\nmaximum destructive interference between the direct wave and the upper limit value of the\nspecular reflected component is assumed.\nThe fade margin calculations for the diffuse reflection assume that the scattered\ncomponent of the reflected signal has a Rayleigh distribution of amplitude and a uniform\ndistribution of phase. The resultant signal level of a random component plus a steady-state\ncomponent for a desired percentage of the time has been calculated as a function of a\nparameter K. The parameter K is defined as follows:\n<E, >\n\nwhere\n\n< E, > = mean magnitude of random field component\nEd\n\n= magnitude of direct wave field component\n\nI\n\n= mean magnitude of total normalized incoherent field\n\nThe diffuse component of the reflected wave is characterized by a Rayleigh distribution of\namplitude and a uniform distribution of phase. Therefore, the maximum fade depth to\nwhich the resultant of the diffuse and specular reflected wave components will fade must\nbe described in statistical terms. The fade depth exceeded a given percentage of the time as\na function of K has been determined by Norton et al. (ref. 7 )\n4.\nA plot of the fade margin required for resultant signal level exceedance 95% and 99%\nof the time as a function of the parameter K is presented in fig. 75.\nThe mean value of the total normalized incoherent field I was obtained from fig. 74\nand used to evaluate the parameter K in accordance with eq. (1 14).\nGiven the parameter K, the basic fade margin allowance for the diffuse component\nFr of the reflected wave was determined for the desired exceedance time using calculated\nvalues as presented in fig. 75. It should be noted that the effect of antenna radiation pattern\ndiscrimination has not been included in the basic fade margin allowance.\nThe total basic fade margin Fb is the sum of the specular and diffuse (random) component fade margins, or:\nFb = Fs + Fr\nCurves showing the total basic fade margin as a function of grazing angle for both vertical\nand horizontal polarization are shown in figs, 76,77,\nand 78.

The antenna should not only have an optimum response with regard to the\ndirect signal between the airplane and the satellite, but should have a minimal response with\nregard to the reflected wave from the earth\'s surface. The ratio of the total direct-wave gain\nof the antenna to the reflected-wave gain at a particular angle of arrival is defined as the\nmultipath discrimination factor.\nSince the system used circular polarization, the radiation pattern effects upon the\nvertical and horizontal components of both the direct and reflected waves are first considered separately and then combined to determine the resultant effects for circular\npolarization.\n\n6.2.4.I Antenna multipath discrimination: The relative gain of the airplane antenna\nto the direct and reflected waves as a function of satellite elevation angle was determined\nfrom the antenna radiation pattern models shown in figs. 62 and 63 for vertical and horizontal polarization. The assumption was made that the arrival angle of the reflected wave\nbelow the horizon is equal to the angle of arrival of the direct wave above the horizon. The\nantenna multipath discrimination in decibels was determined using the relationship:\n\nwhere\n\nD = antenna multipath discrimination, dB\nG1 = relative gain of antenna in direction of direct wave, dB\n\nG2 = relative gain of antenna in direction of reflected wave, dB\nCurves showing the antenna multipath discrimination as a function of satellite elevation\nangles are presented in fig. 79 for horizontal polarization and in fig. 80 for vertical polarization.\nAdditional curves are included in each of the figures that show the effect upon antenna discrimination of tilting the antenna at angles of lo", 20", and 30" toward the satellite.\n\n6.2.4.2 Resultant multipath fade margin calculation: The calculation of the total\nmultipath fade margin allowance for each polarization component requires that the basic\nfade margin allowance be modified to include the effects of antenna radiation pattern\ndiscrimination.\nAs described in Sec. 6.2.3.3, the basic fade margin allowance F b is the sum of the\nspecular component Fs and the diffuse component Fr.. Therefore, in determining the\neffects of antenna discrimination, both the specular and diffuse fade components contributing to the basic fade margin are considered separately.\n\n185\n\nAntenna tilt anale\n\n70\n\n60\n\ng\n\n50\n\ni\n\n0\n.c\nm\n\n.E\nC\n\n.-\n\nji\n\nE\n\n40\n\nti\nC\n\n0\n.4-\n\nm\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\nOO\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\nElevation angle, dag\n\nFIGURE 79.-OR THOGONAL CIRCULAR-MODE-CAVI TY ANTENNA HORIZON TALCOMPONENT RADIATION PATTERN DISCRIMINATION AS A\nFUNCTION OF SATELLITE ELEVATION FOR ANTENNA TILTANGLES\n0\nOF V,lOO,ZOO, AND 3 0\n\n186\n\n30\n\n25\n\nm\nU\n\n20\n\nS\n\n0\n.+\n\nm\n.E\n.S\n\n.E\n\nE\n5\n\n15\n\nm\n\nP\n\n0\n.m\n5\nS\n\nc1\n\nOZ\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n-5\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\nSatellite elevation angle, deg\n\nFlGUR E 80.-ORTHOGONA L CIRCULAR-MODE-CAVITY ANTENNA VERTICALCOMPONENT RADIATION PATTERN DISCRIMINATION AS A\nFUNCTION OF SATELLITE ELEVATION ANGLE FOR ANTENNA\nTILTANGLES OF 00,100, 200, AND 300\n\n187\n\nThe effect of antenna discrimination upon the specular component of the basic fade\nmargin allowance was calculated using the relationship:\n\nwhere F i is the total fade margin allowance for the specular component, and d is the\nantenna radiation pattern discrimination ratio, given by the antilog L! .\n20\nThe calculation of antenna radiation pattern discimination effects upon the diffuse\ncomponent of the basic fade margin allowance requires that a modified value of the parameter\nK be determined using the relationship:\n\nwhere K\' is the value of the parameter K modified to account for antenna radiation\npattern discrimination.\nThe total fade margin allowance for the diffuse component Fr \' is obtained as a\nfunction of K \' for the required time availability using the data presented in fig. 75, as\ndescribed in Sec. 6.2.3.3.\nThus, the fade margin allowance Ft for each polarization is\nFt = F,\'\n\n+ Fr\'\n\n(1 19)\n\nSince the phase of each polarization component of the reflected wave is largely random, it is difficult to determine the magnitude of the resultant signal. Therefore, the assumption was made that the resultant reflected signal was elliptically polarized and had the same\nrotation sense as the direct wave. Under this assumption, the resultant multipath fade margin\nFm was calculated using the following relationship:\n1.414\nFm = 20 loglo\n[(antilog-sr\n\n+ (antilog\n\n%r]\n\n\'/z\n\nwhere Fth is the total fade margin for the horizontally polarized component, and Ftv is the\ntotal fade margin for the vertically polarized component.\nCurves showing the resultant multipath fade margin as a function of elevation angle\nfor three different sea states and 0" antenna tilt angle are presented in figs. 8 1,82, and 83.\nA series of inflight propagation measurements was performed recently (ref. 75) t o\nexperimentally verify multipath fade margin prediction at low grazing angles (below 4 O )\nbased on the experimental work of Beard (refs. 71 and 72).

However,\nfurther measurements at larger grazing angles and at 1.62 GHz would be desirable to further\nsubstantiate required fade margin predictions.\n\n6.2.4.3 Discussion o f antenna radiation pattern effects on the required multipath\nThe curves presented in Secs. 6.2.4.1 and 6.2.4.2 indicate that:\nFor a specified time availability of 95%, a 0" antenna tilt angle, and all\nelevation angles greater than 1Oo ,the maximum resultant fade margins for\nsea states 0, 1, and 2 are 1.4, 1.5, and 1.2 dB respectively.\nFor a specified time availability of 9976, a 0" antenna tilt angle, and all .\nelevation angles greater than lo", the maximum resultant fade margins for\nsea states 0, 1, and 2 are 1.4, 1.9, and 1.6 dB respectively.\nThe higher the elevation angle the greater the antenna pattern discrimination\nand hence the lower the required fade margin.\nAs the antenna tilt angle increases, the antenna pattern discrimination is\ndegraded and consequently the required fade margin must be increased.\n\nThe higher the sea state the more significant the random component of the\nreflected wave and hence the more dependent the fade margin is upon the\nspecified time availability.\n6.3 Overall Operational Performance\nThe impact of propagation upon satellite system performance is a function of the\nrelative magnitude of the various propagation effects and how they interact within the system operational environment.\nA detailed performance analysis of the propagation path between the airplane terminal and two synchronous satellites was performed for five selected airplane locations along\nthe great-circle track between New York and London. The satellite locations were selected\nas being over the equator at west longitudes 10" and 50". A polar projection showing the\nsystem configuration selected for analysis is shown in fig. 84.\nData are presented that include satellite bearing and elevation angle relative to the\nairplane heading and fade margin to each satellite, together with ionospheric and tropospheric\ngroup delay for both the direct and multipath signal.\n6.3.1 Performance analyses. - The operational performance of the propagation link\nbetween the airplane and the satellite was determined using the propagation models described\nin Sec. 6.1 and the propagation effects data derived in Sec.6.2.

In general, the required system fade\nmargin allowance is large for low elevation angles and small for high elevation angles. This\nresults mainly from the fact that the antenna pattern discrimination decreases and the specular\nreflection coefficient increases as the elevation angle is lowered.\nThe results also indicate that the multipath signal reflection points for either satellite\nare no greater than 70 n.mi. apart. Since the observed sea state would be expected to change\nvery little over this distance, it is doubtful that a two-satellite diversity system could be\nsuccessfully employed to reduce the system multipath fade margin requirements.\n6.3.3 Conclusions. - A typical North Atlantic flight path has been used to demonstrate\nthe expected enroute propagation effects on an airborne L-band satellite communication system. Extension of this work to other geographic areas (i.e., North and South Pacific, North\nAmerican continent, etc.) for various propagation conditions should lead to adequate propagation effects predictions for most of the existing major air routes.\nHowever, before such an extension is initiated, it would be desirable to substantiate,\nby experimental observation, the theoretically derived results presented herein. At the\npresent time there is a very limited amount of applicable experimental data (in particular,\nmultipath scattering data) available to verify aeronautical satellite communication system\nperformance at L-band frequencies. For this reason, it is recommended that a series of\nappropriate inflight measurements be performed against an L-band satellite signal source to\nconfirm predicted system margins.\n\nIn the interim, it is suggested that the calculated values of multipath fade margin and\ntotal path delay be used in predicting cornmunications/surveillancelink performance. Thus,\nfor the North Atlantic area, a multipath fade margin of 2 dB will be required, and a total\npath delay of 275 feet will represent the maximum propagation range error for each satelliteto-airplane link.\n\n196\n\n7.0 AIRCRAFT RADIO NOISE ENVIRONMENT\n\nOne critical parameter that may limit the performance level real\naircraft terminal is\nL-band satellite communicationslsurveillan\ntions to the receive\nnoise temperature of the receiving system.\ner front end, ohmi\narise from inherent thermal sources within\nmismatches in the transmission line between the receiver and receiving antenna, ohmic losses\nin the antenna, onboard equipment radio frequency interference (RFI), aircraft thermal\nsources due to aircraft skin aerodynamic heating, atmospheric sources, and external terrestrial\nand extraterrestrial sources.\nThe extent and characteristics of radio noise from these sources are analyzed in order\nto define the total aircraft radio noise environment likely to be encountered by the aircraft\nreceiver. Particular emphasis is given to those sources specifically contributing to the apparent\nantenna noise temperature.\n7.1 Onboard Radio Noise\n7.1.1 Receiver front end noise. - Until fairly recently, typical receiver noise temperatures of 1000\xc2\xb0K or more limited system sensitivity at microwave frequencies, including the\nL-band frequencies of interest in satellite communications/surveillancesystems ( 1540 to\n1660 MHz). However, the development of low-noise preamplifiers (e.g., transistor, maser,\nand parametric amplifiers) has resulted in typical receiver noise temperatures as low as\n10\xc2\xb0K. (Available receiver noise temperature curves are detailed in Sec. 2.0 of vol. V.)\nConsequently, the receiver can become a secondary contributor to system noise. The frontend noise temperature level ultimately required in a particular system can be selected only\nafter detailed parametric tradeoff studies of system power budget, costs, and comparative\nnoise temperatures from other sources. In an L-band satellite system, high path losses and\nlimited radiated powers will, in general, necessitate the use of low-noise preamplifiers placed\nas close to the antenna as practicable.\n7.1.2 Ohmic losses and mismatch noise. - Ohmic losses associated with the transmission line between the receiver input and the receiving antenna output, losses due to\nimpedance mismatches at each end of the line, and antenna ohmic losses all contribute to\nsystem radio noise. They effectively degrade the ideal antenna noise temperature according\nto the relation:\nTeff = \xe2\x80\x98amb\n\nL\n\nwhere\nTeff = effective antenna\n\neiver input due to ohmic losses\n\nonents located within\nTamb = ambient temperature (\xe2\x80\x9cK),\ne\npressurized, air-conditioned environments; 3 5 5 O K within the cable run\ncompartment in an SST aircraft\nL\n= ohmic losses ahead of the preamplifier (losses after preamplifier output are masked\nby preamplifier gain)\n\n197\n\nTant. = apparent antenna temperature ( O K ) due to external aircraft thermal sources,\nand terrestrial and extraterrestrial sources.\nFigure 85 shows values of antenna noise temperature degradation for typical values\nof apparent antenna temperatures and ohmic losses. These losses are generally m\npractical system design because they not only generate noise, but simultaneously\ninput signals. Assuming a practical loss of 1.5 dB and an antenna noise temperature of\n150"K, it is seen that the effective antenna temperature is raised to 185\xc2\xb0K.\n7.1.3 Aircraft self-generated radio noise. - Aircraft self-generated random radio noise\ncan originate within other onboard electrical/electronic systems and be coupled into the\ncommunications system via wiring or internal radiation, or via radiation through and along\nthe aircraft skin into the receiving antennas, In addition, radio frequency interference (RFI)\nfrom other onboard rf radiating systems operating near to, or harmonically related to, the\nL-band satcom receiving frequency (i.e., ATC beacon, DME, collision avoidance [CAS] ,\nweather radar, etc.), can be coupled via radiation between the systems\' antennas. Selfgenerated RFI generally is amenable to standard electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) testing\nand corrective procedures given individual airplanes during preflight and flight test periods.\nBut, to date, there is a paucity of data from measurement of onboard RFI at 1500 to\n1700 MHz, principally because there have been few airborne systems operating in this\nfrequency range. Quantitative noise measurements on a DC-3 aircraft at 1000 and 3000 MHz\nusing downward-looking, circularly polarized antennas and low-noise (300\xc2\xb0K) receivers have\nbeen reported (ref. 76). In this case, the aircraft systems and equipment were treated normally for RFI suppression, and self-generated noise was not received. The Apollo Program\nAirborne Range Instrumentation Aircraft (ARIA) mounts S-band equipment in the 1700-to2300-MHz frequency range. Brief telephone reports from the ARIA project (NASA\nGoddard), ARIA prime contractor (Douglas/Tulsa), and ARIA electronics contractor\n(Bendix Radio) indicate that ARIA aircraft were tested prior to delivery for RFI/EMC\nsuppression to RFI specification requiring a 12-dB noise figure (NF) measuring receiver.\nSeveral subsequent flights with onboard operational S-band telemetry receivers having\n4-dB NF, both on a NASA DC-4 test aircraft and on operational ARIA aircraft, indicated\nnegligible aircraft-generated noise received at 2300 MHz. N o data were taken at 1700 MHz\nbecause of a prior decision not to use channel assignments in that frequency range. Early\nflights on the DC-4 using the ARIA S-band equipment showed 700 to 1000\xc2\xb0K system\ntemperatures, which were attributed solely to front-end losses.\nIt appears that intensive RFI/EMC treatment of the SST to an EMC specification\nrequiring a measuring receiver having a noise figure in the order of 5 dB or less will ensure\nreduction of aircraft self-generated radio noise to levels that will not degrade L-band satcom\nterminal performance. However, inflight measurements of aircraft-generated noise at L-band\nfrequencies using the low-noise airborne terminal receiver and antenna would probably be\nmore significant. The flight test program with the experimental terminal will provide an\nopportunity to make meaningful measurements of this type. In the interim it may be possible to make preliminary L-band measurements on a subsonic jet using instrumentation as\nsensitive as the experimental-termin\nch an experiment is briefly outlined in\nentify possible problem areas to be cogSec. 4.3.1 ,vol.

The resulting thermal radio noise may be induced into the\nairborne terminal receiving antenna by direct heating of the antenna itself; its protective\nradome, if any; or through antenna main-beam or side-lobe pickup.\n7.2.1.1 Antenna surfacelradome thermal noise: For aerodynamic and structural\nconsiderations, the SST L-band terminal receiving antenna will undoubtedly be flush with\nthe aircraft skin, most likely being placed on or near the fuselage top centerline, above or\nforward of the wing root area. The surface of the antenna or any dielectric radome covering\nit will, therefore, attain the ambient skin temperature and induce thermal noise into the\nantenna terminals. The noise temperature from a \xe2\x80\x9chot\xe2\x80\x9d radome or antenna dielectric is\ncalculated (ref. 77) as follows:\n\nT t = L \xe2\x80\x98lrLT\nkB kB(6C2)\n\n.Ah\nh2\n\nT = thermal temperature of radome, OK\nTt = equivalent noise temperature at the antenna terminals, OK\nr\n\n= distance between the antenna and radome, meters\n\nPn = radio noise power (radome generated), watts\nk = Boltzmann\xe2\x80\x99s constant ( 1.38 x 10-23joule/*K)\n\nB = bandwidth, Hz\n300\n== operating wavelength, meters\nf, MHz\nAA =bandwidth, meters = [AL - h u ]\n\ndB\n\nC2 = constant (1.44)\n~1 = constant (3.74 x 10- 12 watt-cm 2\n\nFor the satcom application, typical parameter values are assumed:\nr\n\n= 1 cm = 10-2 meters\n\nB =2%=300MH~\nA = 20 cm = 20 x 10 -2 meters\nAh = 4 cm = 4 x 10 -2 meters\nT =5SO\xc2\xb0K\n200\n\n1000\nI\n\ni\n\nII\n\n900\n\ni\n\nFrom ref., 78\n.\n\n!\n\ni.\n,.\n\n.. - ...\n\n.\n\n..\n\n800\n-:..\n\n1\ni .-.\n\nr\n\n700\n!\n\nY\n\ni\n3\n\n!\ni\n\nf\n\n-\n\nE\nm\n\n!\n\n!\ni\n\n*\xe2\x80\x99\n.\n\n1\n\n. .\n\n1 ;\n\n600\n\n*\xe2\x80\x99\n.\n\n:\n\n500\n\n1\n\n!\n\nE\nir\n\n!\n\nQ)\n\nt -\n\n!I\n\ni - i\nI\n!\n\n.. ..\nI\n\n!\n1\n\n1\n--I.I\n\n.\n\n..\n\n7\n\nI\n\n400\n\nt r-\n\n. . .,. ..

The amount of thermal radiation from a \xe2\x80\x9chot\xe2\x80\x9d object depends not only on its\ntemperature, but also upon the degree with which the object approaches black-body characteristics and upon the temperature of reflected objects. If the object does not have true\nblack-body characteristics, it radiates a portion of the radiation from other objects that\nilluminate it. The degree of radiation of such a \xe2\x80\x9cgray\xe2\x80\x9d body depends upon its emissivity,\nwhich by Kirchoff\xe2\x80\x98s law (ref. 79) is the ratio of thermal electromagnetic power emitted by\na gray body to that of a black body at the same temperature. Emissivity equals the absorptivity of the body; hence, it equals (1 - R). Therefore, the effective noise radiation temperature (equivalent source temperature) of a gray body is\n\nwhere Tt is the thermal temperature of the body, and R is the reflectivity of the body\nsurface viewed by the antenna.\nFor the L-band satcom terminal considered here, the surface reflectivity of typical\ntitanium alloy Type 64, which is likely to be used on the SST, is computed from the\nrelations (ref. 52):\nEr\n\nsin$ - d n\n\nRH=-= sin+ +\n\ndTl&\n\nfor horizontally polarized radiation components; for vertically polarized components:\n\nwhere\nE, = reflected wave\nEi = incident wave\n\nJ, =grazingangle\nn2 =\n\n202\n\nE\n\n- j60ah (describing the properties of titanium 64 in MKS units)\n\nE\n\n= dielectric constant (=1.O)\n\nCT\n\n= conductivity (measured as 6.1\n\nx lo5\n\nA = wavelength (0.2 meter at 1500 MHz)\nfig. 87, which gives the magnitude of\nThe results of the computations are sho\nof grazing angle for both polarizations\nthe reflection coefficients (reflectivity) as a fun\nof incident wave.

(1 24), is\nTb = 550\xc2\xb0K (1 - 0.4)\n\n330\xc2\xb0K\n\n(127)\n\nAt the present time, the exact location of the satcom antenna and the \xe2\x80\x9chot\xe2\x80\x9d areas\nof the SST airplane that its main and side lobes will illuminate are indeterminable because\nthe airplane configuration has not been finalized. Consequently, only an estimate can be\nmade of the thermal noise contribution to the apparent antenna temperature from this\nsource. A \xe2\x80\x9cworst case\xe2\x80\x9d assumption might be a 20-dB gain antenna mounted atop the\nfuselage with its main beam pointed directly aft at the \xe2\x80\x9chot\xe2\x80\x9d leading edge of the vertical\nstabilizer, as illustrated in fig. 88.\nThe \xe2\x80\x9chot\xe2\x80\x9d projected area that the antenna beam might intercept is estimated at\n13 times 300 inches or 3900 square inches (2.52 square meters) at a distance r = 30.48 meters\nfrom the antenna. Considering the relative geometry for this example, the equivalent solid\nA\n3 = (2.72 10-3)\nangle subtended by the \xe2\x80\x9chot\xe2\x80\x9d source is calculated to be approximately\nr2\nsteradians. For a 20-dB gain antenna, the beam area of the major antenna lobe is\n\n0 = & &C\n=\nI\nG\n\n100\n\n= 0.1256 steradians\n\nSince w < Q ,the equivalent antenna temperature for a 20-dB antenna, is\n\nwhere Tb is the equivalent source temperature, O K . A factor of 1/2 is applied here, because\nonly one plane of polarization is observed at grazing angles to the vertical stabilizer surface.\nTherefore,\n\n203\n\n1\n9\nc-\n\nn\n\nI\n\n2\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n0\n(9\n\nI\n\nOIJll\n\n204\n\nI\n\nx\n\nI\n\n1\nhs\n\nd\n\nI\n\nJ\nC\n\n205\n\nFor comparison, the beam area of a lower gain antenna, say a 3 d B upper-hemispherical\ntype, is:\n\n4n\n\na=-=\n\n6.28 steradians\n\n2\nand\nTa\xe2\x80\x99;\n\n(\n\n2.72 x 106.28\n\n\xe2\x80\x99)\n\n(300)=0.07*K\n\nObviously, these noise temperatures are relatively inconsequential, even in the worst case.\nThe situation where the flush antenna \xe2\x80\x9cside lobes\xe2\x80\x9d graze the fuselage skin must also\nbe considered. A typical \xe2\x80\x9cworst case\xe2\x80\x9d likely would be observed for the low-gain 3-dB\nhemispherical-coverage-type antenna. In practice, such an antenna would have no more\nthan - 2-dB gain (vertical polarization) at grazing angles less than 1\xe2\x80\x9d and, again, would see\nonly the vertically polarized component of the maximum skin radiation (1 15\xc2\xb0K). The\napparent noise temperature due to this source is difficult to evaluate in the near-field\n(Fresnel) region, which extends approximately 0.1 meter from the antenna center at\n1500 MHz, so the effect due to the far-field (Fraunhofer) region will be considered as\ntypical. Hence, the maximum apparent antenna noise temperature at this grazing angle\nwould be (0.63) (1 15\xc2\xb0K) = 72.5\xe2\x80\x9dK. It appears that this would be an inherently constant\ntemperature at Mach 2.7 speeds.\nLack of meaningful data for this case suggests a need for experimental investigation\nwith low-noise receiving equipment and typical antennas to determine the actual temperature\nenvironment. An outline for such tests in included in Sec. 4.0 of vol. V.\n7.2.2 Atmospheric noise. - The SST L-band satellite surveillance and communications\nterminal generally will be operating at altitudes well above the normal upper bounds of the\natmosphere where no atmospheric contribution to airborne terminal antenna noise temperature would be expected. However, emergency situations over ocean areas at low altitudes\nmay require continued system operation. Consequently, atmospheric noise must be considered in evaluating the total noise environment of the system.\n7.2.2. I Absorption noise: An absorbing medium, such as the atmosphere, emits\nthermal noise that can be described in terms of a brightness temperature Ta according to\nthe relation (ref. 80):\n\nwhere Tt is the thermal equilibrium temperature of the medium, and a is the attenuation\nconstant at a distance r.\nThis is simply the apparent sky temperature due to atmospheric absorption as seen\nby an idealized narrow-beam antenna. The attenuation constant will be the sum of the\nindividual contributions by atmospheric gases (principally oxygen and water vapor) and\nby condensed water.\n\n206\n\nwhere L is the PO\n\n10 g/m3 at the earth\'s surface to zero at an altitude of 5 km. The variation of pressure and\nds with the International Standard Atmosphere.\ntemperature with height closely corres\nThe calculated values agree closely with the few available experimental values measured\nunder summer conditions.\nIt is seen from the curves that at 1500 MHz the apparent temperature due to absorption can reach 100\xc2\xb0K at 0" elevation angle, but drops rapidly to about 11\xc2\xb0K as the elevation\nangle is raised to 10". Above 10" elevation, the temperature lies between 10"and 2\xc2\xb0K. It\nis significant to note that these temperatures are those seen by an antenna on the earth\'s\nsurface and are due to the total atmospheric thickness. Since the greatest density of the\natmosphere occurs below 20 000 feet (6.1 km) altitude, it is reasonable to assume the\ntemperatures indicated above would decrease by a factor of at least 10 dB at an airborne\nantenna flying above that altitude. Therefore, a very consewative estimate of the maximum\ntemperature from this source is 10\xc2\xb0K.\n\n7.2.2.2 Precipitation static noise: The problem of interference to aircraft radio\nreceiving systems resulting from precipitation static (P-static) and its elimination has been\nstudied at considerable length as it applies to subsonic and transonic airplanes. The various\nnoise-producing mechanisms are well understood and techniques for minimizing the\nseverity of this noise have been developed (refs. 82 through 97). In the case of subsonic\nand transonic aircraft, the primary source of vehicle-induced noise has been found to be\nstatic electrification of the airplane. Electrification can occur as a result of plasma processes\nin the combustion chambers of jet engines or, more severely, from frictional "triboelectric"\ncharging that occurs when precipitation (in the form of water droplets or ice crystals) or\ndust particles strike the airplane skin (two dissimilar materials placed in contact and then\nseparated).\n\nrather cold and operated with water injection, it is doubtful that engine charging would ever\n\n207\n\n1000\n\nloa\n\nY\nO\n\n10\n\n1\nFrequency, GHz\n\nFIGURE 89.-ATMOSPHERIC NOISE TEMPERATURES (SUMMER) FOR TYPICAL\nGLES\n\n208\n\ncause electrical breakdown\norder of 200 ns, making the discharge an effective noise source over a wide rf spectral\nrange. The intensity of corona noise is proportional to the magnitude of the current discharged. The resulting apparent noise temperature of the receiving antenna in turn is dependent upon coupling between the antenna and the source location. Source locations are determined by airplane geometry and airplane potential, which is a function of charging\ncurrent.\nA second type of P-static noise, particularly important to high-performance airplanes\nhaving flush antennas, results from charging of dielectric portions of the airframe (canopies,\nradomes, and flush antenna surfaces) by frictional electrification. However, since these\nsurfaces are insulators, the charge cannot flow off and must accumulate on the dielectric\nsurface until sufficiently high to produce a streamer or spark discharge to some adjacent\nmetallic airplane structure. These discharges are energetic noise sources, particularly if they\noccur on the dielectric covering of an antenna where coupling is also high.\nThe third type of noise in this category consists of overlapping step-front pulses\nproduced as individual precipitation particles acquire a charge upon impingement on a\nsurface region viewed by the antenna field. Since this mechanism requires a component of\nelectric field tangent to the particle path at time of impact, noise from this source is of\nsignificance only when the impact occurs on dielectric portions of the airplane.\nIt is natural to assume that these same basic vehicle-electrification and noise-generating\nprocesses will occur on vehicles operating in the supersonic speed range. However, the magnitudes of the various processes may be quite different. From theoretical studies and laboratory experiments by the Air Force and Stanford Research Institute (ref. 97) it appears that\n\ning speed, and that it goes to zero at roughly Mach 4. Apparently at supersonic velocities\n\n2.09\n\nUntil present investigations of these complicated aerodynamic functions on a full-scale supersonic aircraft can be completed, e\nable subsonic data must suffice.\ncharging current on a KC-135 at\nthat the probability of encountering precipitation of a given density varies considerably\nwith altitude, being generally greater at lower altitudes and quite small at altitudes above\n70 000 feet. While the effect of altitude on the effective area of the aircraft has been neglected\nin deriving these curves, this should produce an error of no more than a factor of two increase\nat the high altitudes where the probability of encountering charging is low. Thus, it appears\nthat charging due to precipitation will be least severe at high altitudes and supersonic speed.\nThe present fixed-wing SST design is expected to exhibit charging characteristics similar to\nthose of the retracted-wing case.\nThe spectrum of the corona noise source for altitudes up to 50 000 feet is available\nfrom ref. 99. These spectra are based on the discharge occurring as a series of fast-rise\npulses with exponential decay. An early investigation of the discharge from needle points\nattached to an aluminum sheet indicated that this pulse form of discharge was retained at\naltitudes up to at least 90 000 feet instead of developing into a continuous glow discharge.\nTherefore, at SST altitudes, corona discharges will be a source of rf noise.\nThe corona noise described in the reference is of the form\n\nwhere v is the corona pulse rate, A is the mean square amplitude of the pulse, and a! is\nthe average decay constant of the pulse. G( w ) is the power spectral density of the corona\ncurrent. The earlier studies of corona noise from a typical wing trailing edge indicate that\nv A2 is independent of frequency and pressure and that a! varies directly with pressure.\nIt is presumed that this trend continues at the higher SST altitudes of interest, even through the\nobserved variation of pulse amplitude and repetition rate at altitudes up to 50 000 feet indicates a decrease in amplitude and an increase in repetition rate as the pressure is reduced.

This calculation probably represents\na \xe2\x80\x9cworst-case,\xe2\x80\x9d since at SST cruising altitudes the probability of aircraft charging is believed\nto be small. Also, if orthogonal null-field dischargers, which have proved effective on subsonic jets, are strategically located on the SST, the corona threshold voltage of the aircraft\nwill be reduced to a re1 ely low level, lowering the discharge current (hence, the noise\ntemperature) if corona\nharges did occuf. In addition, these discharges force all corona\ndischarges to occur in regions of zero rf field and orient the discharge current at right\nangles to any residual rf\ndeeoupling the noise from the antenna.\nture, of \xe2\x80\x9cstreamer\xe2\x80\x9d type P-static will depend\nlargely upon the configuration and location of the particular aircraft antenna dielectrics\n\n213\n\ninvolved. Typical measured values of this type of noise produced on an uncoated radome\nantenna, and extrapolated from \xe2\x80\x981 to 1500 MHz with a 1/f dependence, indicate current\nspectral densities in the order of 10-12 amps/meter (ref. 77), less than that for low-current\ncorona discharges. This noise can be reduced effectively by application of high-resistance\nconductive coatings to the dielectric parts; thus, its absolute magnitude is of little consequence if protective steps are taken. Even without such protective steps, the noise temperature contribution would be less than that from possible corona.\nFew detailed measurements of actual noise levels produced by particle impact are\navailable. They are known to be generally below the noise levels produced by corona discharges and streamers, and they also vary inversely with frequency. Therefore, particle\nimpact noise also should be a relatively inconsequential component of the L-band receiving\nsystem temperature.\nSince data on engine charging and precipitation charging noise at 1500 MHz either\nat transonic or supersonic speeds and especially at SST altitudes are presently unavailable,\nmeasurements of these parameters during SST L-band airborne terminal flight testing would\nseem desirable. Supersonic flight measurements of induced noise levels presently are being\nplanned by The Boeing Company, SRI, and the Air Force (ref. 98).\n7.2.2.3 Sferics: Another possible source of atmospheric radio noise is nearby\nlightning discharges. The radio frequency energy radiated from such discharges is commonly\nreferred to as sferics (atmospherics). Of concern in this study is the apparent noise temperature of sferics at the L-band operating frequency (1500 MHz).\nMost measurements of sferic noise reported in the technical literature have been made in\nterms of field strengths at known distances from the lightning discharges at frequencies below\n100 kHz. Fortunately, a few measurements at HF, UHF, and radar microwave frequencies\nhave also been reported. Calculated spectral energy distributions based on simplified models\nof heavy-current return strokes of ground discharges, for which the radiated energy is known\nto peak at about 10 to 15 kHz, agree satisfactorily with measured distributions in that\nfrequency range. However, the spectral amplitude distributions for higher frequencies are\nnot known to any degree of accuracy, although there is a general understanding of the\ndischarge processes (stepped-leader, junction streamer, and primarily the dart leader) that\nare most likely to radiate high-frequency noise. But there is still no satisfactory analytical\nmodel showing both magnitude and rate of change of discharge currents from which estimates of field amplitudes at high frequencies may be derived. Consequently, the best that\ncan be done at present is to infer the radiated field amplitudes, as a function of frequency,\nfrom available experimental data after normalizing to a common useful reference and reconciling obvious discrepancies between them.\nPublished\xe2\x80\x99experimental data of sferic amplitudes for various frequencies have all been\nbased upon various receiving bandwidths, stated in various units ranging from \xe2\x80\x9cvolts per\nmeter\xe2\x80\x9d (or decibels above microvolts per meter per kilohertz bandwidth) to power density in\nwatts per square meter, and measured at different source distances. From the various parameters of these available data, Alnutt and Oh of The Boeing Company have normalized to\nthe spectral density term \xe2\x80\x9cdecibels above 1pV per meter in\xe2\x80\x98l kHz bandwidth at 1 mile\xe2\x80\x9d\n(dB/ pV/m/kHz mile). The resulting spectral amplitude (peak field intensity) distributions\nare given in fig. 92 for the frequency range above 10 MHz. These plotted data form a base\nfor extrapolation to higher frequencies. From 10 MHz to about 200 MHz a l/f dependence\nwing the same dependence found at frequencies below 10 MHz (not shown).\nthe 1/f5l2dependence seems to pertain.\n\n2 14\n\n215\n\nFrom the foregoing extrapolation, the peak field intensity of close sferics at 1500\nMHz is estimated to be approximately 0 dB/ pV/m/kHz at 1 statute mile. Since the weather\nconditions spawning lightning discharges (hence sferics) would not occur at altitudes above\n55 000 feet (SST cruising altitude is about 70 000 feet), it appears that the closest sferic\nsource in view of the SST receiving antenna (slant range) would be in the order of 10 miles.\nTherefore, the expected level of sferic peak intensity at 10 miles would be 20dB less\nthan that given above, or -20 dB/pV/m/kHz. In addition, a bandwidth correction to\n(-20 log\n1 Hz from 1 kHz is convenient at this point to obtain proper dimensionality for computing\nequivalent power density. This correction (-20 log kHz is -60 dB, so the peak sferic field\nK\n)\nintensity would become -80 dB/ pV/m/Hz at 10 miles.\n\ny)\n\nThe equivalent peak power density then is computed from the relation\nE(dB/V/m/Hz) = 20 log ( 1 2 0 7 4\nwhere S is the power density (watts/m2/Hz)\nRearranging eq.

Obviously, this contribution to apparent antenna temperatures is insignificant.\n\n7.2.3 Terrestrial noise. - The earth is generally assumed to have a noise temperature\nof about 290\xc2\xb0K. The antenna temperature will approach this value if the main beam\norientation is at or b\nhe horizon. Even\nation angles, radiation\nthe earth will be pi\nS.\nThe amount of noise\nup from the earth is related to the percentage of the\npower that would be\nhe earth if the antenna were transmitting. Terrain that\nhas a high reflection coefficient contributes less mise than terrain that reflects poorly, as\nexplained in Sec. 7.2.1.2. Thus, the sea acts like a white body whereas land acts more like\na black body. In general, the earth must be considered a gray body, the degree of grayness\n(hence its temperature) depending upon the elevation angle, surface characteristics, frequency,\nand radiation polarization.\nUsing standard measured values of surface conductivities and dielectric constants for\nsea water (a = 5 x 10-1 lemu, E = 80) and poor land (a = 10-14 emu, E = 4) the reflection\ncoefficients of each surface were determined for various elevation angles at 1500 MHz, using\neq. ( 125) and ( 126) as in Terman (ref. 100). Then equivalent earth source temperatures\nwere computed, using eq. (1 24). Figure 93 gives the resulting curves. It is seen that over\nsea water, the earth looks noisiest at 6" grazing angle (pseudo-Brewster angle), and that over\npoor land, it looks noisiest at 25" grazing angle. At these angles, the earth appears to be\nnearly a black body. It is clear, then, that low-noise system performance requires an aircraft\nantenna whose radiation pattern discriminates against radiation from the earth, particularly\nat these angles below the horizon. It is pertinent, therefore, to determine the apparent temperature of a typical SST L-band satellite terminal antenna due to earth radiation. The noise\ntemperature for any given antenna is a function of its radiation pattern, as well as a function\nof elevation angle, azimuth angle, and ground characteristics. Rigorously, that temperature\nwill result from the double integration of the antenna pattern directivity over the lower\nhemisphere and for both polarizations, plus the double integral of earth temperature for all\nvalues of grazing angle and for both polarizations, according to the relation:\n\nf\nTa= 1\n47r 0\n\n"\nl\n\n\'I2\n\nTs ( 8 ,9) D 8 ,9)sin d e d@\n(\n\nblack-body source) in the\ny in the directions 8 and\ndetailed knowledge of the\n\nive noise tempe\nD(8,$) is the a\ndirections 8 and $,\n9.

The average noise temperature value of each source is Ti. (A gainweighted average is actually called for; that is, averaging should take into account the variation of the antenna directivity over the source solid angle, but cruder averaging is usually\nsatisfactory.) The quantity depends only on the antenna pattern and expresses the fraction\nof the total volume under the three-dimensional volume contour contained in the solid angle\nQ of the ith source. Thesumof all the ai\xe2\x80\x99s must equal unity:\n\nc\nn\n\nq = 1\n\n(147)\n\ni= 1\nIn this context, the term \xe2\x80\x9cantenna pattern\xe2\x80\x9d is the effective pattern in the actual\nenvironment, rather than the free-space pattern.\nThe foregoing concept will be used to evaluate roughly the noise temperature\ncontribution of the earth into the 27r steradian solid angle of a simple upper-hemispherical\naircraft antenna\xe2\x80\x99s backlobe pointing at the earth. The measured radiation pattern taken on a\nscale model of a typical antenna (an orthogonal dual-mode cavity) will be used. Two cases\nwill be considered: one in which the antenna is mounted on the top centerline of the fuselage and another in which the same antenna is mounted 30\xe2\x80\x9d from the top centerline to bring\nthe mainlobe closer to the horizon. (An antenna on each side of the fuselage top centerline\nwould be required for full upper-hemispherical coverage in the latter configuration.) It will\nbe assumed for approximate evaluation of eq. ( 146) that each solid-angle sector (n) consists\nof a spherical segment centered around a specific negative elevation angle (depression angle\nfrom the airplane) looking at the earth. The fraction ai of the total volume of the pattern\nis the fraction of the total solid angle Qi of the spherical segment, and, for simplicity, it is\nassumed to be proportional to the pattern directivity D at the ith elevation angle. Hence,\na very low percentage of the pattern volume in the lower hemisphere intersects the earth.\nSince the earth is \xe2\x80\x9csegment\xe2\x80\x9d filling, each segment\xe2\x80\x99s effective temperature is the source temperature at the segment angle multiplied by the segment fractional directivity. If the directivity at any angle is greater than unity, the effective temperature is the source temperature,\nsince it cannot be greater.\nThe results of this approach are tabulated in table 17 for both antenna locations,\nvertical and horizontal polarizations, and sea and land temperatures (from fig. 93). The\napproximate apparent antenna temperatures due to earth radiation are then obtained by the\nnumerical summation and averaging of the effective segment temperatures. Obviously, the\nantenna location 30\xe2\x80\x99 off the fuselage top centerline gives a.higher apparent antenna temperature than that for a top-mounted antenna. Also, the vertically polarized component of the\nearth\xe2\x80\x99s radiation gives a significantly higher apparent temperature than does the horizontal\ncomponent, whether the source is sea or land. The maximum value of apparent antenna\ntemperature over sea water is seen to be approximately 45% (vertical polarization) for the\ntop-mounted antenna and 102.8O K for the off-center-mounted antenna. The former would\nbe the most desirable configuration from this viewpoint. For both antennas, the apparent\nnoise temperatures over both sea and land are comparable, being slightly higher over land.\nIn this study, the temperature over sea water is most applicable to the system configuration\nand will be used in the determination of total system temperature.\n\n2 19\n\n1\nc\n\n0\n.+\n\nm\n\n8\nv\nQ\n\n0\n\nCI\n\na3\n\nL\nQ,\n\nr\n\n.%\n\nE\na\nr\nL\n\na\n\nQ\n\na\n7\n\nCC\n\nm\n\nC\nC\n+,\na3\n.\n\nc\nm\n\n.m\n\nC\n\n7\n\n2\n\nI\n\n.\'mmd-cDoo\'Co\nI\n\n220\n\nl\n\nl\n\nl\n\nl\n\nl\n\nl\n\nl\n\nNN----.--bO-\n\nl\n\n+++++\n\n.-F\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nThe above represents a "worst ca\nince if the antenna were a higher directivity type,\nhaving considerably lower side-lobe gain\n-20 dB) at the lower grazing angles, its apparent\nnoise temperature from earth radiation would correspondingly reduce to a value below about\n5"K, a relatively insignificant contribution to total antenna temperature.\nevaluat\nparagraphs.\n7.2.4.1 Solar noise: The sun is\nhaps the most important of all extraterrestrial\nly infrequently lie in the major lobes of a highly\nsources of radio noise even though it w\ndirectional antenna. Although of small angular extent, its apparent noise temperature nevertheless may be sufficiently high to contribute significant noise even in the antenna side lobes.\n\nRadio noise emanating from the sun is frequently divided into three general components: a basic thermal component, a slowly varying component, and a rapidly varying component (due to radio bursts). The last is often further subdivided into classes of solar noise\nknown as noise storms or enhanced radio outbursts and isolated bursts. The component most\nsignificant in communications is the thermal radio emission, a relatively constant radiation\nthat exists when all sources of enhanced solar emission are absent. Although enhanced conditions rarely occur, the basic noise level may be determined by extrapolating observations to\nzero sunspot area. Also, at wavelengths less than approximately 2 cm (1 5 GHz) all solar\nradiation, excluding obvious bursts, may be attributed to the thermal component.\nThe apparent temperature of the entire quiet sun as a function of wavelength for an\nassumed solar electron density distribution, and for coronal and chromospheric temperatures\nof lo6 and 104"K, respectively, has been computed (ref. 102). These data are shown in\nfig. 9 4 along with observed values of the apparent temperature of the quiet sun as collected\nby Pawsey and Smerd. The observed brightness temperatures are in general agreement with\nthe calculated values.\nThe experimentally observed slowly varying component of solar emission has been\nfound to show a high degree of correlation with total sunspot area. It can be detected over\na frequency range from about 500 MHz to 10 GHz. At the lower frequencies, its effect is\nsmall in comparison with the effects of solar radio bursts; at the higher radio frequencies, its\nmagnitude becomes negligible relative to the thermal component.\nPeriods of radio noise storms (enhanced radiation) are observed frequently and consist\nof short bursts related to the occurrence of large active sunspot areas on the solar disk. They\nare also associated with periods of enhanced background radiation. They may last for several\nhours or even days, but do not contribute to the radio noise level at frequencies above about\n600 MHz.\n\nonly. Occasionally th\nmuch shorter duration and apparently are not observed at frequencies higher than 300 MHz.\nTo determine the relative contribution by the sun of noise in the main lobe of the\nL-band satcom antenna, the main lobe area is related to the solid angle of the solar source\nand the apparent temperature of the source. To a first approximation, Kraus and KO (ref.\n103) have shown that\n22 1\n\nwhere\nTa\n\n=\n\nTb =\n0\n\n=\n\n! =\n2\n\nequivalent antenna temperature\napparent source temperature (assumed to have a Val\nover the extent of the source)\nsolid angle subtended by the source\nsteradians for the sun)\nbeam area of the major antenna lobe\n(G = lobe gain above isotropic)\n\nproximately 6.8 x\n\n(2\n\nsteradians\n\n)\n\nFrom fig. 94 it is found that Tb at the satcom receiving frequency of concern\n(1500 MHz) equals 105" K. Using this value in the solution of the above expression results\nin the curve of fig. 95 from which it is seen that the equivalent noise temperature contribution of the sun is not greater than 533\xc2\xb0K for antenna gains of 20 dB or 1.08"K for a 3-dB\nhemispherical antenna. (The sun is beam filling only when the antenna gain is greater than\n53 dB.) Obviously, the solar noise contribution is relatively inconsequential for airborne\nterminal antennas having practical gain values (G < 20 dB). Owing to the relatively small\nincluded angle of the solar disk, the maximum noise temperature would be seen only occasionally and for short periods.\n\n7.2.4.2 Lunar noise: Radiation from the moon is believed to be principally thermal\nin nature. Such radiation may generally be neglected in the consideration of extraterrestrial\nradio noise as interference to communications systems. At microwave frequencies (nominally\n1.O to 10 GHz), the moon is observed to have an apparent brightness temperature varying\nbetween about 150\xc2\xb0 and 250\xc2\xb0K, depending upon its phase. These values are two to three\norders of magnitude lower than those for the sun, averaged over approximately the same\nsolid angle as the sun. Using these values in the relation of eq. (148), it is seen that the\nequivalent noise temperature contribution of the moon is not greater than 0.135OK for a\n20-dB antenna or 0.0027OK for a 3-dB antenna, an inconsequential contribution indeed.\n7.2.4.3 Planetary noise: Radiation from the planets is also believed to be principally\nthermal in nature. Measured apparent temperatues of the planets (according to Mayer, ref.\n104) vary between 200\xc2\xb0K for Saturn and Mars to about 600\xc2\xb0K for Venus. Jupiter shows\nanomolous behavior in that the apparent temperature varies from about 150" K at 10 GHz to\nabout 50 000" K at about 450 MHz. Assuming a linear relation with frequency, the apparent\ntemperature of Jupiter (the "hottest" planet) at 1500 MHz would be about 2000" K, nearly\nthree orders of magnitude less than the sun (fig. 94). Since the angular extent of Jupiter and\nthe other planets is much smaller than that of the solar disk, the noise contributions to the\n\' *\nuential, especially for\nairborne\nlow-to-m\naircraft terminal.\n\n222\n\n106\n\n105\n\nY\n\n0\n\n104\n\n103\n\nFrequency, MHz\n\nFIGURE 94.-APPARENT TEMPERATURESOF QUIET SUN AND JUPITER\n\n223\n\n."\n>\n.a\nET\n\nw\n\n10\n\n20\n\n50\n\n100\n\n200\n\n10-3:\n500\n\nAntenna gain, numerical\n\nFIGURE 95.-EQUIVALENT NOISE TEMPERATURES FOR SUN AND RADIO STAR\nCASSIOPEIA\n\n224\n\n7.2.4.4 Radio star noise: Discrete sources of radio-frequency radiation called radio\nstars superimpose noise on the general cosmic background. These sources are of very small\nangular extent and will rarely lie within the beamwidth of even moderately directive antennas.\nMoreover, when this does occur, the noise contribution will generally be little greater than\nthe cosmic background for typical receiving antennas. According to Whitfield (ref. 105), the\nvariation of flux density with frequency for the four strongest localized sources, designated\nCassiopeia A, Cygnus A, Virgo A, and Taurus A, is as shown in fig. 96. At 1500 MHz\nCassiopeia A provides the greatest flux density, 2 x 10-23 watts per meter square per Hertz.\nThe equivalent apparent antenna temperature from this source is found from the expression:\n\nwhere\nTa\n\n=\n\napparent antenna temperature, OK\n\nS\n\n=\n\nsource power flux density, watts/m 2/Hz\n\nA,\n\n.=\n\nmaximum effective antenna aperture =\n\nk\n\n=\n\nBoltzmann\'s constant (1.38 x\n\nD\n\n=\n\nantenna pattern directivity\n\nA\n\n=\n\noperating wavelength, meters\n\nD A2\n47r\njoules/OK)\n\n-,square meters\n\nSubstituting pertinent values and solving for Ta gives:\n\n= 4.6 x\n\nLikewise, Ta = (4.6 x\n\n(5) = 2.3 x\n\nOK(D = 2; hemispherical pattern)\n\nK for D = 10.\n\nThese values clearly show that radio stars will not contribute significantly to the\nreceiving antenna noise of the L-band terminal.\n\n7.2.4.5 Galactic (cosmic) noise: The galactic background radiation is generally eonsidered to be of both galactic and extragalactic origin. The radio sky brightness due to the\nbackground radiation does, however, show a distinct maximum in the direction of the\ngalactic center in the Milky Way. The apparent brightness temperature of the sky due to\nbackground cosmic noise, as a function of frequency for various orientations of an earthterminal (or aircraft terminal) antenna, is shown in the curves of fig. 97. The values submitted\nby different investigators are somewhat inconsistent but do fall within less than an order of\nmagnitude. In this analysis the highest range of values reported will be used. In actual practice, the apparent brightness temperature for about 90% of the sky will lie somewhere between the two lower curves. In the worst case, the galactic contribution to radio noise at\n\n225\n\nIU\n\n10\n\n102\n\nFrequency, MHz\n\nFIGURE 96.-FLUX DENSITY OF BRIGHTEST RADIO STARS\n\n226\n\n227\n\n1500 MHz is seen to be about 10\xc2\xb0K. For a 1O-dB gain antenna, pointed directly at the\ngalactic center, this contribution-would be 1OO"K, which could be significant if the antenna\nwere pointed continuously in that direction. In practice, the temperature of about 90% of\nthe sky will lie between the lower two curves of fig. 97, so even a IO-dB antenna will have\nan insignificant apparent noise temperature most of the time.\n\n7.2.4.6 Interstellar hydrogen noise: In addition to the general cosmic background,\nwhich has an essentially continuous frequency spectrum, emissions from cold neutral hydrogen in the galaxy is also observed. Although this hydrogen radiation is much greater than the\ncosmic background noise, it is restricted to a narrow range of frequencies around 1420 MHz,\nand consequently does not constitute a significant, serious limitation at the 1500- to 1700-MHz\nportion of the spectrum.\n7.3 Terminal System Noise Temperature\nThe foregoing discussions have determined estimates of individual apparent noise\ntemperature contributions from known sources. Since noise theory states that noise powers\nare directly additive if they are Gaussian-distributed and uncorrelated (originate from\nindependent sources), the total expected system noise temperature will be the sum of all\ncontributions considered; namely\n\nwhere\nTr\n\n=\n\nnoise temperature due to receiver front end\n\nTL\n\n=\n\nnoise temperature due to ohmic losses\n\nT,T\n\n=\n\napparent antenna noise temperature due to aircraft thermal heating\n\nT a ~ apparent antenna noise temperature due to atmospheric sources\n=\n=\nT a ~ apparent antenna noise temperature due to earth reflections\n\nT,E\n\n=\n\napparent antenna noise temperature due to extraterrestrial sources\n\nOverall system temperatures are evaluated as required in the performance analysis\nsections of this document for the applicable receiver temperatures and circuit losses considered for the aircraft terminal. The overall apparent antenna noise temperature required\nfor the system noise temperature calculations can now be determined from the various\nantenna noise contributions considered in this study that are applicable for the aircraft\nterminal. The factors contributing to apparent antenna temperature are listed in table 18.\nThe significant contributions to apparent antenna noise temperature are summarized\n\nin table 19. Total temperatures at both residual and transient levels are given. Since\ntransient contributions probably will occur less than 0.1% of the SST flight time over the\noceanic area, only the residual tot are considered as a realistic estimate for use in the\n\n228\n\nTABLE 78.-SUMMARY OF ESTIMATED CONTRIBUTING ANTENNA\nNOISE TEMPERATURES\nApparent antenna temperature,\n0\n\nNoise source\n\nLow-gain antenna\n(0to 4 dB)\n\nHigh-gain antenna\n(10to20dB)\n\nRadome thermal\n\n57\n.5\n\n5.75\n\nHot aircraft extremities\n(main beam)\n\n0.07\n\n3.08\n\nHot aircraft skin (side lobes)\nAtmospheric absorption\n\n~72.50\n10.00 (rnax)\n\n* 7.25\n10.00 (rnax)\n\nPrecipitation corona\n\n2.26\n\n2.26\n\nPrecipitation "streamers"\n\n00\n.2\n\n0.02\n\nPrecipitation particle impact\n\n00\n.1\n\n00\n.1\n\nSferics\n\n<00\n.1\n\n< 0,001\n\nTerrestrial (sea), TCL"\n\n4.\n51\n\n5.0\n\nTerrestrial (land), TCL\n\n45.8\n\n50\n.\n\nTerrestrial (sea),\nantenna 30 deg off TCL\n\n102.0\n\n1.\n00\n\nTerrestrial (land),\nantenna 30 deg off TCL\n\n171\n3.\n\n10.0\n\nSolar\n\n10\n.8\n\nLunar\n\n0.0027\n\nPlanets (Jupiter)\n\n< 0.001\n\nRadio stars (Cassiopeia A)\n\n< 0 0 6 (rnax)\n.0\n\nGalaxy (cosmos) max\n\n10\n\n53.8\n0.135\n\n~0.5\n(max)\n0.023 (rnax)\n100\n\nGalaxy (cosmos) avg\n\n01\n.\n\n1 .o\n\nCold neutral galactic\nhydrogen\n\n< 0.005\n\n< 0.005\n\n"Top centerline of fuselage\n\n229\n\n.\n\nm\n\nc\n\nx\n(0\n\n0\n\n.I\n\nF\n\nm\n\nc\n\nC\n\n3m\n\'\n.E I-0\n\nk\n0\n\nJ\n\nm o o\n\n230\n\n8.0 VOICE LINK PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS\n\nThe voice channels of the SST/satellite L-band system are the most critical in terms of link\nperformance, due to power and antenna gain limitations at the satellite and aircraft and to\nthe large signal-to-noise-density ratios required for acceptable link quality. A performance\nanalysis is made for the recommended 13-kHz narrowband-FM (NBFM) scheme (Sec. 5.0),\nwith peak audio clipping and reception using a phase-locked demodulator. This scheme\nappears at present to be the most feasible voice-modulation method for the experimental\nterminal, based on the factors of performance, simplicity, and system cost. Performance is\nanalyzed for L-band (1 540 to 1660 MHz) links operating in a simplex mode with a single- or\nmultiple-channel repeater in the satellite. Results are expressed parametrically for use in\ngeneral design of the L-band system. The single-channel repeater case represents the configuration that would most likely be used for an experimental terminal, whereas the operational system-having more than one voice link-would require repeaters in the satellites\nhaving multiple-channel capabilities. For the multichannel case, it is assumed that the total\nnumber of voice channels is divided equally between the two satellites of the system, as\ndetermined in the routing analysis of Sec. 4.1, For the recommended operational system\nhaving six voice channels, therefore, each satellite would have a three-channel voice repeater.\n8.1 Voice Link Geometry and Spectrum Usage\nAnalysis has shown that a simplex voice scheme is desirable for ATC-to-aircraft voice\ncommunications, based on spectrum conservation and similarity to existing voice communications modes (VHF and HF). At present, all commercial ground-to-aircraft voice links are of\nthe simplex type, where the same frequency is used for both the uplink and downlink. This\nrequires a push-to-talk usage with only one party talking at a time. A relay disconnects the\nuser\'s receiver when he is transmitting to prevent saturation caused by transmitter power\nleaking through to the receiver. The simplex mode provides adequate voice communications\nwith little or no inconvenience arising from the required receive/transmit switchover.\nUsage of a satellite terminal as a voice link relay results in the requirement for an\nadditional frequency for simplex voice communications, as shown in fig. 98. Existing\nsatellite voice links use a repeater that receives at one frequency and translates the signal to\nanother frequency for retransmission to earth. Generally the downlink frequency would\nbe the lower one, according to the existing satcom convention. Both the ground terminal\nand the aircraft would thus transmit on the same uplink frequency and receive on the same\ndownlink frequency. Simultaneous transmission by both users will of course result in mutual\ninterference at the repeater, so that a simplex format, with one party transmitting at a time,\nis necessary. It is not required that switching be done between power amplifier and receiver,\nas is the case of direct (ground-to-aircraft) simplex links, since for the satellite relay situation\ntransmission and reception will be performed on different frequencies. It would be necessary,\nhowever, for the FM voice exciter to be switched so that the unmodulated currier is not transmitted to the satellite repeater to degrade the signal of the party speaking.\nProposed allocations in the L-band for satellite voice\' communications provide the\n1540-to-1560-MHz band for downlinks from the satellite and the 1640-to-1660-MHz band\nfor uplinks, according to FAA recommendations as detailed in ref. 13. Voice link assignments\nwithin these 20-MHz bands for the L-band satellite/SST system are shown in the following\nsection to,require a 25-kHz bandwidth per channel. That is, a 25-kHz band is required in\nboth the uplink and downlink frequency regions for each voice channel in use in the system,\n\n23 1\n\nr---\n\n232\n\nI\n\nfor an overall spectrum allocation of 50 kHz for each channel. This usage appears reasonable\nin view of present channel bandwidths in the VHF band of 50 kHz per voice channel, with\nattempts being made to reduce this further to 25 kHz for greater spectrum usage in the heavily utilized VHF band. At the relatively uncrowded L-band, the 25-kHz bandwidths appear\nreasonable for the system. Further bandwidth is required, however, for a multiple-channel\nsystem to provide guardbands to reduce crosstalk generated in the satellite repeater. The\nadded bandwidth required becomes particularly significant only when four or more channels\nare routed through the satellite repeater. This crosstalk problem is discussed in Sec. 8.2.\nDuplex operation of the ATC/satellite/aircraft voice links, permitting simultaneous\ntransmission by both users, does not appear warranted due to insignificant improvement in\nlink operation and the necessity of allocating twice as much spectrum for each channel.\nDuplex links would require two uplink bands and two downlink bands for implementation,\nthus wasting available spectrum and needlessly complicating equipment at all three terminals.\nSimplex operation thus appears most suitable for the L-band satellite/SST voice communications links.\n8.2 Required Voice Link Channel Bandwidths\nAllocated bandwidths for the voice channels in the L-band ground/satellite/aircraft\nsystem must be sufficiently wide to encompass:\n(1)\n\nThe voice channel rf bandwidth, Brf.\n\n(2)\n\nAll rf frequency uncertainty effects (due to oscillator instabilities and\nDoppler shifts) in the various voice links.\n\n(3)\n\nGuardbands to reduce IM crosstalk interference between adjacent channels\nresulting from nonlinearities in the satellite repeater due to limiting.\n\nThe rf bandwidth (Brf) for the NBFM modulation scheme considered is calculated\nin Sec. 5.3.3 to be 13 kHz for a voice baseband to 3.2 kHz and 6 d B peak-to-rms audio\nclipping. Less than 1%of transmitted energy will fall outside this bandwidth.\nIn determining the various rf frequency uncertainties, several assumptions are made\nconcerning system operation and geometry. These are:\nA very stable reference oscillator will exist at the ATC as a frequency reference in generating all initial voice link carriers. Long-term instabilities of\nk 10 - 9 or better are feasible for this application. The oscillator would likewise be used in generating all required frequencies for the tone surveillance\nsystem, if selected.\n\nNo significant relative motion exists between the ATC and satellite as the\nsatellite will be in a stationary equatorial synchronous orbit with minimum\ndrift.\nThe satellite repeater will operate on a simple superheterodyned downtranslation scheme, with conversion down to i.f., limiting, and conversion up\nto the downlink rf. Frequency reference is obtained from an onboard local\noscillator, eliminating the requirement for a more complex repeater with\n\n233\n\nfrequency reference obtained from tracking the incoming signal. The satellite\nrepeater will be as described in Sec. 3.1.5, but would have only one i.f.\nl\nchannel through which al voice links would be passed.\n\n(4)\n\nThe carrier originating from the aircraft for the return voice link will be\ngenerated aboard the aircraft by an independent local oscillator (LO) rather\nthan being coherently related to either the uplink voice or surveillance\ncarrier. This independent generation reduces the worst-case frequency\nuncertainty; since coherent turnaround would include the effects of the\ntwo-way satellite/aircraft Doppler shift for the return link. Local-oscillator\ncarrier generation, however, will result in only a one-way Doppler shift in\naddition to oscillator instability, which results in a frequency uncertainty\nsubstantially lower than the coherent turnaround case.\n\nWorst-case frequency uncertainty factors due to oscillator instabilities and Doppler\nshifts are summarized in table 20 for the four different links existing between terminals\n(fig. 98). Frequency assignment of uplink and downlink voice channels is assumed to be consistent with FAA recommendations in ref. 13. Channel placement is considered at the upper\nend of each band, i.e., at 1560 and 1660 MHz, for which Doppler shift is maximum. An\nSST aircraft is assumed that is expected to cruise at Mach 2.7 at an altitude of 70 000 feet,\ncorresponding to a velocity of 0.43 n,mi./sec. Worst-case Doppler shifts are calculated for\nan SST directly in line with the satellite, and the satellite at 10" elevation angle. Localoscillator instabilities at the satellite and aircraft are assumed as 10 - 6 long-term conservative estimates for realizable equipment accuracies (e.g., the Collins Model 6 18T HF\ntransceiver used in commercial aircraft has an oscillator instability drift of 20.8 x 10 -6/\nmonth). The frequency translation of the satellite repeater is 100 MHz, from 1660 MHz\nto 1560 MHz.\n\n*\n\nAs seen in table 20, the maximum frequency uncertainty is +6 1 10 Hz. Without considering channel crosstalk guardbands, the required channel bandwidth is thus seen to be\n25 220 Hz (1 3 kHz rt6.11 kHz). For the single-channel case, where only one voice link is\npassed through a satellite, this 25-kHz spectrum bandwidth allocation is sufficient, since no\ncrosstalk due to odd-order IM products exists. The actual repeater i.f. noise bandwidth is\nslightly larger, however, due to the greater repeater frequency uncertainty at i.f. than at rf\nand t o the filter bandwidth uncertainties, as discussed in See. 3.1.5. At the repeater i.f., total\nbandwidth is then voice rf bandwidth ( 13 kHz), frequency uncertainty at the satellite\n(rt6.01 kHz maximum from table 20, for the return voice link), repeater i.f. frequency\nuncertainty k 1 6 6 0 Hz for the rt 10 -6 repeater LO instability assumed, as determined from\neq. (5), in Sec. 3.1.51, and i.f. filter margin (+go0 Hz + 10%of the total bandwidth, from\nSec. 3.1 S ) . The total i.f. noise bandwidth (Bn) is thus 33.2 kHz (+45.2 dB).\nFor multiple channels passing through the satellite repeater, with a frequencydivision multiple-access scheme and saturated-mode power amplifier assumed, additional\nguardbands must be provided to eliminate (or minimize) crosstalk. Work by Sevy (ref. 12)\nconsiders this crosstalk problem by determining the optimum channel spacings for multiple\nFM signals to yield negligible third- and fifth-order crosstalk. Results are summarized in\ntable 21 for the case of two, three, and four channels in theiepeater, each of bandwidth B\n(25 kHz for the case considered).\n\n234\n\nN\n\nN\n\nN\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\nQ,\nc-\n\nE;\nco\n\nc-\n\nd\n\nF\n\nco\nSI\n\nSI\n\n$\nI\n\nn\n\n8\nm\n0\n\n$\n\ne.\n\nn\n\n8\nm\n0\n\nI\n\n#\n3\n-.\n\n0\n\nH\n\nCI\n\n\\\n0\n\nN\n\nH\n\nco\nLn\nc-\n\nI\n\n%\nc-\n\n0\n\n+.\'\n\nm\n\nN\n\nI\n0\n\nco\n\nm\nC\n\n\\\n\n0\n\nN\n\n0\n\n%\n\nI\n\ng\n\n(D\n\n\'i3\'\n\\ r n\n\ntt\nL\n\n\'3\n1\n\nY-!\n\nY\n\nY\n\nH\n\n0\n\nco\nc-\n\nY\n\nII II II\n\nI\nc\n,\n\nY-\n\nm\n\n0\n\nc,\n\n+\na\n\n0\n0\n\nc,\n\n0\n\nc\n,\n\n0\nf-\n\na\n\n\'c-\n\n235\n\nVoice channels\n\nChannel assignments to\neliminate third-order crosstalk\n\n2\n3\n\n\' 8\n\n4\n\n236\n\nl 8\n\n183,7,\n15\n\nChannel assignments\nto eliminate third- and\nf ifth-order crosstalk\n\n1r3\n3r7\n\n1,3,1\n0\n1,3,10, 31\n\nAs seen, significant increases in repeater bandwidth are required if crosstalk is to be\nreduced. The four-channel case, for example, requires a bandwidth of 15B to eliminate\nthird-order crosstalk and 3 1 3 to eliminate fifth-order crosstalk. As a result, significant\npenalties in bandwidth utilization and performance due to wider repeater bandwidths\neventually result, particularly if it is desirable to eliminate higher-order crosstalk terms.\nFor the two-channel case, if a guardband is provided equal in bandwidth to another\nchannel, no crosstalk of any magnitude will result, as determined in ref. 12. For more channels, however, crosstalk of all orders higher than those compensated for will be present.\nThus, the four-channel case will have fifth-order and higher crosstalk for the 1, 3, 7, 15\nspacing and seventh-order and higher crosstalk for the 1, 3, 10,31 spacing. Channel spacing\nis discussed further in the multichannel analysis of Sec. 8.3.2. For the single-channel case,\na spectrum allocation bandwidth of 25 kHz and a repeater IF bandwidth of 33.2 kHz are\nseen to be sufficient.\n8.3 Link Analysis\nAnalysis of voice link performance is made with detailed worst-case link analyses of\nthe four voice links depicted in fig. 98. All significant results are graphed parametrically for\nsubsequent trade analysis. Link analysis entries are described in app. A for those items used\nin the initial analyses. Other entries are treated parametrically as described in the following\nparagraphs. The case of a single-channel satellite repeater, representing a possible experimental terminal, is treated first, with subsequent consideration given to the multichannel\nrepeater case for an operational system.\n\n8.3.1 Slngle-channel satellite repeater. - Initial assumptions for the worst-case link\nanalysis for the single-channel case include a regional-coverage satellite antenna, a\nhemispherical-coverage aircraft antenna, and a moderate-size (5-foot) ATC antenna. The\nregional-coverage satellite antenna, with peak gain 6 dB above that of an earth-coverage\nantenna, is found to be necessary for satisfactory transmission of voice communications\nusing a moderate-gain (< 5-dB) antenna at the aircraft. Transmitter powers in the link\nanalysis are chosen in all cases to result in threshold performance, and the antenna gain and\ntransmitter power values are subsequently scaled parametrically to illustrate system trades.\nAll other link entries are assumed realistically for the worst-case system conditions, as\ndetailed in app. A. The required carrier-to-noise-density ratio C/@ for adequate NBFM voice\nperformance is +50.0 dB-Hz, as determined in Sec. 5.3.3.\nA 2-dB multipath fading margin is provided on the satellite-aircraft link, which, in\nconjunction with aircraft antenna discrimination, ensures protection against multipath interference in the North Atlantic area greater than 99%of the time, as discussed in Sec. 6.2.3.\nNoise temperatures at the three terminals are chosen conservatively, based on available frontend devices and realistic noise environment contributions. The procedure by which link\nperformance is determined is described in the following paragraphs.\n8.3.1. I Forward path, A TC to aircraft: - The voice link forward path, from the ATC\nto the aircraft, includes the ATC-to-satellite and satellite-to-aircraft links. It is apparent that\nthe downlink, from satellite to aircraft, is the more critical one, due to constraints upon\nsatellite transmitter power and aircraft receiving antenna gain. In contrast, the uplink is not\nlimited, since ATC transmitter power and transmitting antenna gain are available as required.\nSince the downlink performance will depend on that of the uplink, namely, upon the output\n\n237\n\nS/N of the repeater, it is necessary that a strong S/N exists at the repeater in order to minimize the downlink degradation effects. The design\nto provide sufficient S/\nthe uplink to result in\nte transmitter power\nThe degradation problem is considered in the surveillance\nthe two degradation effects due to the presence of transmitted additive noise in the downlink:\n(1)\n\nSignal power degradation D 1 due to the consumption of transmitter power\nto transmit the noise\n\n(2)\n\nAircraft receiver noise degradation D2 due to the additive received noise\n\nSignal power degradation D 1,the proportion of signal power to total power trans\nmitted, is shown in fig. 9 of See. 3.1.6.1 as a function of S/N 1, the repeater output signalto-noise ratio, in Bn. Receiver noise degradation D2 is shown in fig. 10 of Sec. 3.1.6.1 as\na function of S/N1 for various values of C/@Bn. Finally, the two degradations are combined in fig. 11, which also is plotted versus S/N 1 for values of C/@Bn. For the singlechannel case considered, C/@ is +50.0 dB-Hz and Bn is 33.2 kHz (+45.2 dB), so that\nC/QBn is +4.8 dB. The combined degradations in fig. 11 are in effect the increase in satellite transmitter power required to overcome the combined noise degradation effects in the\ndownlink. Due to a high premium on available transmitter power at the satellite, an increase\nin the transmitter power of 0.3 dB due to noise degradation is assumed to be tolerable. This\nvalue then requires a transmitted S/N 1 of +18.4 dB, as seen from fig. 1 1. For the +18.4 dB\nS/N1, D1 is 0.1 dB (fig. 9) and D2 is 0.2 dB (fig. 10).\nThe performance of the two forward-path links can now be determined, as shown in\ntable 22, for the assumed required S/N1 of +18.4 dB at the satellite repeater output. The\nrequired input S/N to the IF limiter is +15.5 dB, taking into account the limiter improvement\neffect of the repeater as discussed in Sec. 3.1.6.1. A graph of output SIN improvement for a\nsingle signal passing through a hard-limiting repeater is shown in fig. 12 of Sec. 3.1.6.1. As\nseen, a +2.9-dB improvement is realized for the forward path. Since a noise power of\n- 153.9 dBW exists in the repeater, a received signal power 15.5 dB higher, or - 138.4 dBW, is\nrequired, corresponding to a transmitter power of only 6 watts (7.8 dBW) for the system\ndefined. A tradeoff of transmit power and antenna gain at the ATC is possible and will be\ndiscussed in conjunction with the return path performance.\nThe satellite-to-aircraft link performance, also shown in table 22, can now be determined for the +18.4-dB downlink S/N. The threshold signal power is seen to be - 150.4 dBW\nfor the +50.0 dB-Hz C/@ required for NBFM. For O-dB margin, the received signal would\nalso be - 150.4 d\nthat total received power, 0.3 dB higher, must be - 150.1 dBW, since\nIts in a D1 of 0.1 dB and a D2 of 0.2 dB. For th\nthe +18.4-dB S /\nthe required transmitter power is then +22.1\nThis power value may, of course, be\nainable level by providing\nhe same threshold link performance. This\ngreater than - 1-dB aircraft antenna gain to o\ntrade is shown in fig. 99, which presents the overall performance of the forward voice link for\nnce of the link with an earth-\n\n238\n\n8\n\nc\nm\nC\n.-\n\n239\n\n100\n\n50\n\n-50\n\nIn\n\n20\n\nt:\n\ne\n\nL\xe2\x80\x98\n\n43\n\ns\n\n0\n\nn\n\n85\n\nt:\n.E\n\n- 20\n\n10\n\nE\n\nI\xe2\x80\x99\n.\n\n.e\n3\n0)\n\n0\n\nI-\n\nI\xe2\x80\x99\n0)\n.\n\n6\n7\n\n-10 &5\n\n5\n\n6n\n\n-\n\n85\n\n-\n\n4\n\n-\n\n.E\n\nI\xe2\x80\x99\n-.\n\nC\n\nE\n- I . \xe2\x80\x99\n\nb\nm\n\n-5\n\n.\n\n2\n\n-2\n\n1\nAircraft antenna gain (Incl. pointing loss). dB\n\nFIGURE 99.- VOICE LINK PERFORMANCE FOR SINGLE CHANNEL\n(EXPERIMENTAL TERMINAL)\n\n240\n\nL\n\n2\n\nz\n\n(1) the better noise performance (0.5 dB) of the terminal and (2) the lower polarization loss\n(-0.5 dB) between the two terminals. Pointing loss is included in the antenna gain parameter\nalong the abscissa. For a typical design case, it is seen that a 50-watt satellite transmitter\nwith regional-coverage antenna would require an aircraft antenna gain of +4.0 dB for threshold link performance. Should an earth-coverage antenna be used, limitations on available\nsatellite power would necessitate substantial gain from the aircraft antenna. Even with\n50 watts of satellite power, + 1 1.O dB of antenna gain would be required. As seen, therefore,\na regional-coverage satellite antenna is required to eliminate complex, high-gain antenna\nrequirements at the aircraft.\n\n8.3.1.2 Return path, aircraft to ATC: The design of the return voice link presents\na different problem in that for this case it is the uplink, from aircraft to satellite, that is the\nlimiting case, due to the desirability of minimizing aircraft transmitter power. The downlink,\non the other hand, can tolerate moderate uplink repeater degradation because of the availability of a high-gain ATC antenna. The links are thus designed to minimize aircraft transmitter power by requiring as low a SIN as is feasible at the satellite repeater output on the\nreturn path. The combined effects on the link of additive noise through the satellite repeater\nare as shown previously in fig. 1 1. Since a low S/N 1 is desired at the satellite repeater output to reduce aircraft transmitter power, an operating point is selected for reasonably low\nS/N 1. As seen in fig. 1 1, for C/@Bn of +4.8 dB, S/N 1 must be greater than +4.8 dB for\nsatisfactory performance, since below this point even unlimited downlink power would be of\nno use in meeting the link threshold. A S/N 1 of +5.3 dB is thus selected as a compromise,\npermitting low S/N on the uplink while not requiring extreme penalties on the downlink.\nThe combined degradation is 10.8 dB, a D1 of 1.1 dB (fig. 9) and a D2 of 9.7 dB [eq. (18)l.\nThe link analysis of table 23 shows link performance for the chosen S/N1. For\n+5.3 dB S/N 1 out of the satellite repeater, a repeater input SIN of only +4.0 dB is required,\nbecause of a + 1.3-dB hard-limiter improvement (fig. 12). For a noise power in Bn of\n-1 53.9 dBW, the required received signal power on the aircraft-to-satellite link is thus\n-149.9 dBW, corresponding to a transmitter power of +23.8 dBW (240 watts) at the aircraft, which can be traded off with the aircraft and satellite antenna gains, as for the forward\nlink. Both trades are shown in fig. 99, permitting scaling among satellite and aircraft transmitter powers and antenna gains. For a regional-coverage satellite antenna and +4.0-dB\naircraft antenna gain, it is seen that about a 76-watt aircraft transmitter would be required for\nthe return-path voice link. For an earth-coverage satellite antenna, aircraft gain and power\nrequirements increase correspondingly. For an 1 1-dB aircraft antenna gain (as might be\nrequired for the forward link), 95 watts of transmit power is required for the return link.\nThe performance of the downlink, from satellite to ATC, is also shown in table 23.\nThreshold signal power is seen to be - 155.4 dBW for the NBFM C/@ of +50.0 dB-Hz. For\nthe threshold case (zero-dB margin), the effective received signal power must also be\n- 155.4 dBW, corresponding to a required total received power of - 144.6 dBW, since a\nSIN1 at the satellite of +5.3 dB, as determined, results in a D1 of 1.1 dB and a D2 of\n9.7 dB. The required satellite transmitter power for the system assumed is thus seen to be\n+1.5 dBW (1.4 watts). It is apparent, however, that the\nllite transmit power will in\nreality be whatever value is used for the forward link to\naircraft, since the return link\noperates in a simp mode through the same repeater as the forward link. The performance\nof the return link\nthus be significantly above threshold, or the ATC antenna may simply\nbe reduced (for the actual satellite transmit power) from the 5-foot size originally assumed.\nIn turn, this reduced ATC antenna size would require increased power for the forward\nATC-to-satellite link, which presents no problem, since ATC power would still be on the\n\n24 1\n\n242\n\norder of several hundred watts or less. For balanced forward and return links between the\nATC and the satellite, with threshold performance on each, the tradeoff between ATC\ntransmitter power and antenna gain for a given satellite voice transmitter power is shown in\nfig. 100 for both earth- and regional-coverage satellite antennas. For a 30-watt satellite\ntransmitter power and regional-coverage antenna, it is seen that an ATC downlink antenna\ngain of only +11.6 dB at 1560 MHz is required, corresponding to an uplink ( 1660 MHz) gain\nof +12.1 dB and an ATC transmitter power of 130 watts.\nAs is apparent from the foregoing analysis, it is the satellite/aircraft links, rather than\nthe satellite/ATC links, that are critical to the system operation in terms of performance\nlimitations. For this reason, the link design is oriented to favoring these links, by providing\nsufficient ATC power and gain as required to overcome degradation effects of the satellite\nrepeater. For both forward and return links, satellite and aircraft constraints are minimized\nwherever possible. The ultimate choice of ATC parameters is not critical at this time, since\nin all instances only moderate requirements of antenna size ( 10 feet or less) and transmit\npower (several hundred watts or less) exist. Since surveillance links over the same ATC\nfacilities are envisioned, ATC antenna sizing would be performed for the more limiting case,\nso that in some instances more margin than required would be available. Narrow enough\nbeamwidths must of course be available with the ATC antennas to permit spectrum conservation on the surveillance links through spatial diversity, allowing the same frequency for\nsurveillance between the ATC center and each satellite.\n8.3.2 Multiple-channel satellite repeater. - The performance of the L-band voice\nsystem for a multichannel satellite repeater is more critical than for the single-channel case,\ndue to degradation effects caused by handling several signals through a common repeater.\nThe degradation penalties are thus borne by increased satellite, aircraft, and ATC transmitter\npowers. From the traffic analysis studies of vol. 11, the operational system was found to\nrequire a total of six voice links for adequate voice communications under peak-hour, peakload conditions. Furthermore, the routing alternate analysis of Sec. 4.1 recommended equal\nloading of voice links through the satellites, so that three links would be routed through each\nsatellite. The following analysis considers the system performance for two, three, and four\nlinks through each satellite, so that aircraft terminal requirements for an operational system\ncan be estimated. The experimental system, on the other hand, which is the prime concern\nof this study, may only consist of one voice link, due to constraints and limitations upon\nsatellite power and gain and available aircraft antenna gain.\nFor an operational system, link usage is recommended in a frequency-division\nmultiple-access mode, where several links simultaneously use a common satellite repeater.\nOther types of access, including time-division, spread-spectrum, and code-address systems,\nare felt to be too complex for consideration for a multiple-user commercial aircraft network,\nin view of problems of attendent synchronization, equipment complexity, or poor energy or\nbandwidth efficiency.\nThe problems associated with frequency-division access are those of (1) power sharing\nand S/N degradation effects among channels, and (2) IM product crosstalk interference caused\nby repeater nonlinearities. Since prime power is limited at the satellite terminal, operation of\nthe repeater power amplifier in a saturated mode is desirable; to obtain maximum dc-to-rf\nconversion efficiency at the satellite terminal. In order to operate under saturation, however,\nprevious limiting must be performed, in the i.f. stage, which may result in further imbalance\nof powers among channels, S/N degradations in the weaker channels, and the generation of\nintermodulation produ , which provide crosstalk when present in the voice channel bandwidths. Power sharing ong channels at the power amplifier is further aggravated by the\n\n243\n\nI\n\n-----+I\n\n.\n\nE\n/*\n?\n-\n\n=?=\n\n244\n\nvariation in received signal levels. Aircraft- transmissions, for example, will vary at the\nsatellite by 5 to 10 dB due to differences in effective antenna n, space loss, and equipment\nvariations. In addition, the relative signal levels between ATC d aircraft transmissions will\nbe sizable, since ground transmissions will be overpowerd in comparison to aircraft\non the critical satellite-to-aircraft link. F\nmissions so that sufficient S/N is availa\nthe combination of ATC and aircraft t\nissions in the repeater will vary with time since\nlink usage is random.\nVarious solutions are possible, however, to minimize these effects. For example, the\nvarious channels can be kept isolated from each other until power amplification by i.f.\nchannelization\', so that each received signal can be adjusted to a desired power level prior to\ncombining the channels for power amplification, so that power sharing can be controlled. A\nfurther technique is to space channels optimally, as discussed in Sec. 8.2, to eliminate or\nminimize crosstalk interference. Spectrum conservation goals may limit a spacing scheme,\nhowever, due to rapidly increasing bandwidth requirements for more than three channels.\nThe effects of signal degradations with saturated-amplifier operation must be overcome with increased transmitter power at both satellite and ATC or aircraft terminals. Intermodulation products, for example, consume a portion of satellite transmitter power,\nrequiring increased power for actual signal transmission, while S/N degradations due to\nlimiting must be overcome by increased power from the originating terminal so that an\nimproved S/N is available at the satellite.\nSince degradations inevitably arise due to saturated-amplifier operation, it may be\ndesirable to operate instead on a linear portion of the amplifier characteristic by "backingoff" several decibels from the saturation point. Such operation results in poorer device\nefficiency, but may nevertheless be more suitable due to reductions in signal degradations\nfrom the saturated case.\nThe evaluation of this trade involving the satellite repeater (saturated or linear,\nchannelized or single channel) is at the discretion of the satellite system contractor, and\nshould of necessity include laboratory evaluation of candidate schemes. The preferred\nrepeater configuration should be selected based on the criterion of providing the required\nsystem performance for the voice links (three per satellite according to traffic analysis) with\nminimum power penalties on the aircraft and satellite terminals. Degradations due to the\nmultichannel case, for example, should not require significantly more aircraft power than for\nthe single-channel case nor should satellite power be increased, if possible, significantly\nbeyond that required if all voice channels were passed independently without degradation\neffects. An experimental program should also be conducted to examine the effects of\nincoherent third- and fifth-order intermodulation products on an active voice channel in\nterms of attainable intelligibility and demodulation degradation effects, so that measures of\ntolerance levels within a voice channel can be obtained.\nIt is assumed for purposes of analysis-to permit evaluation of aircraft terminal\ntransmit power-that multiple-channel voice routing in the satellite will be through a single\nrepeater employing ( 1) channeliz\nhard-limiting, (2) Saturated power amplification, and\n(3) channel spacing to minimize\nsstalk (fig. 101). The hard-limiting at i.f. will ensure\noperation in the saturated regio\npower amplifier and will permit individual channel\nlevel control for optimal power sharing. The channel spacing criteria are selected according\nto Sevy (ref. 12) to minimize intermodulation crosstalk among channels. For the twochannel case, 1-3 spacing will be provided, which will eliminate all intermodulation crosstalk;\nfor the three-channel case, a 1-3-7 channel spacing will be provided, which will eliminate all\n\n245\n\n246\n\nthird-order IM products. The four-channel case, considered for comparison even though the\nrecommended system employs three voice channels through each of two satellites, will similarly employ spacing (1, 3, 7, 15) to eliminate only third-order crosstalk. In each of these\nlatter cases, the fifth-order IM will be reduced by more than 14 dB with respect to the voice\nchannel (ref. 12), which is assumed tolerable for purposes of analysis. It is recognized that\nthe repeater scheme assumed for multichannel operation may not be optimum in terms of\nimplementation of the satellite terminal. The assumptions made, however, do permit preliminary evaluation of the aircraft terminal requirements for the operational system. The\nsatellite scheme considered results in relatively minor penalties to the satellite terminal over\nthe single-channel case discussed earlier.\nThe bandwidth of each i.f. channel in the channelized scheme assumed is the same as\nfor the single-channel case: 33.2 kHz (+45.2 dB). Hard limiting in each channel results in\nS/N enhancement or degradation as determined by Davenport (ref. 14) and shown previously\nin fig. 12. Gain compensation is then provided so that the powers in all i.f. channels are\nuniform before summing and presentation to the power amplifier. The presence of all signals\nin the power amplifier then results in power sharing, generation of IM terms, and S/N degradations for those channels having weak input S/N\xe2\x80\x99s. The amplifier would require a total\npower equal to the sum of the powers required in each channel plus power consumed by the\nIM products. IM power is expected to be but a small portion of the total. Sevy, for example,\nin ref. 12 shows loss due to IM terms to be slightly greater than 1 dB for four signals through\na hard limiter. Since a power amplifier exhibits the characteristics of a soft limiter, for\nwhich IM loss is even less, an added power in the amplifier of 1 dB is reasonable for this\nfactor. Total required power of the amplifier is thus assumed to be the power required for\nan individual channel multiplied by the number of channels, plus 1 dB additional for IM\nlosses in the case of multiple channels.\nA S/N degradation will exist in the amplifier for weaker channels when present in\ncombination with channels of high S/N. As a first approximation, this S/N degradation is\nestimated by standard S/N degradation effects in a hard limiter for multiple signals in a\nuniform-level noise environment. For the two-channel case, treated by Jones (ref. 16), the\nweaker signal is found to be degraded about 3 dB, where the signal-to-signal ratio is 10 dB or\ngreater and the weaker signal input SIN is greater than zero dB (fig. 14). The stronger signal,\non the other hand, is enhanced in S/N by 3 dB, so that an overall signal-to-signal suppression\nof 6 dB results. For the three- and four-channel cases, discussed by Shaft (ref. 106), S/N\ndegradation of a weaker channel is found to be approximately the same as for the twochannel case. Worst-case suppression between signals occurs for the case of one strong signal\nand the other signals weak: for the three-channel case, this suppression is about 5.5 dB and\nfor the four-channel case, slightly less. Since when the signal-to-signal ratio is high, the strong\nsignal behaves as a single signal in noise, the S/N enhancement of the strong signal will\napproach the 3-dB maximum of the single- and two-channel cases. Since signal-to-signal\nsuppression is about 5.5 dB, the S/N degradation of the weaker signal will be 3 dB, or slightly\nless. A 3-dB weak signal S/N degradation is assumed, as for the two-channel case. The 3-dB\ndegradation must then be compensated for with increased aircraft transmitter power, so that\na 3-dB higher S/N is obtained at the repeater to absorb the degradation. Further experimental\nanalysis of weak signal degradation is required for the channelized repeater case so that these\neffects can be measured more accurately for system compensation. For the present, as a first\nestimate, it is simply assumed that 3-dB additional aircraft transmitter power is required to\novercome the degradation effects associated with multichannel voice repeater operation.\n\n247\n\nassumed (saturated\nThese include (1)\nmultiplied by the nu\nand (2) 3-dB additiona\n\n8.4 Voice Link Performance Summary\n\nThe performance of the voice links can now be summarized for the single- and multichannel cases in terms of satellite and aircraft transmit power and gain requirements.\nFigure 102 shows this performance for the case of a regional-coverage satellite antenna,\ndetermined from analysis to be desirable in order to permit moderate (< 5 dB) aircraft\nantenna gains. The performance of the links for an earth-coverage satellite antenna will be\n7.8 dB poorer than that shown, requiring either 7.8-dB greater transmit power at both the\nsatellite and aircraft or 7.8-dB greater antenna gain at the aircraft. The graphs of fig. 102\nconsider from one to four voice channels per satellite, with required satellite power shown\nas a function of aircraft antenna gain. Required aircraft transmit power is alsa indicated for\nthe single-channel case, with 3-dB additional power being required for the multichannel case.\nThe discontinuity in the curves occurs at the transition from low-gain to beam aircraft antennas where a 1-dB improvement is achieved from improved aircraft noise temperature and\nlower polarization loss (see Sec. 8.3.1.1 ),\nAs a design example using fig. 102, consider the single-channel case with 50 watts of\navailable satellite transmit power, which might be representative of an experimental terminal.\nAs seen, a +4dB aircraft antenna gain is required, with an aircraft transmit power of about\n73 watts needed for the return link. For an operational system of three channels in the\nsatellite repeater, a total satellite transmitter power of 100 watts would require a 6-dB aircraft antenna gain, for a regional-coverage satellite antenna (an operational-system satellite\nwould most likely have greater gain than that provided by a regional-coverage antenna,\nrequiring a corresponding lower aircraft antenna gain). The required aircraft transmit power\nfor a three-channel regional-coverage system would be 100-watts when a 6-dB aircraft\nantenna gain is used.\n\n248\n\n249\n\nentified. Finally, lower\n\nfined and the reasons for i\nformance criteria are arbit\n9.1 Reliability Criteria\n\nThe communication reliability for the airplane-to-satellite link was analyzed using\nthree parameters customarily employed to define communication system performance:\ngrade of service, time availability, and service probability.\nGrade of service is normally expressed as the percentage of binary errors allowable\nfor digital systems or the percentage of word intelligibility for voice systems. It refers to the\ndegree of reliability over a short period of time during which the statistics of the S/N may be\nconsidered constant.\nTime availability refers to the percentage of hours (or other periods of time used in\ndefining grade of service) during which the specified grade of service or better will be\nachieved.\nlity that a specified grade of service or better\nptable was determined to be that required to\n\n2 50\n\npossible flight delays asso\nAn additional factor requiring major consideration in the economic evaluation of the\nsystem is the effective isotropic radiated power (EIRP) of the satellite. An increase in satellite EIRP will have a direct effect upon either the weight or lifetime of the satellite and may\nresult in a substantial increase in launch cost. However, a reduction in satellite EIRP will rewith a resulting incr\nquire a corresponding increase in airborne terminal per\npose significant operational\nthe weight and complexity of the airborne terminals, an\nconstraints upon the system. For example, the improvement in performance obtained by\nusing a high-gain airplane antenna as compared to a low-gain antenna will result in increased\nsystem initial cost, weight, and complexity, and can also impose operational constraints\nsince antenna beam steering may be required.\nThe relative feasibility of implementing the system will therefore depend on the\noverall cost of the system as compared to the increased revenues made possible by utilizing\nthe system capabilities. Thus, at least a qualitative evaluation of overall system cost versus\nperformance is a major factor in determining the relative effectiveness of various system\nalternates.\n9.3 Responsiveness Criteria\nThe responsiveness of the system is defiied separately for the communication and\nsurveillance functions. The communications responsiveness is defined as the amount of\ntime required to pass a message between the ATC center and the airplane terminal via the\nsatellite relay. The responsiveness may vary depending upon the type of message and\nwhether the message originates at the ATC or at the airplane terminal. The surveillance\nresponse time is thattime required for the ATC center to obtain a position fix on the airplane terminal.\nThe most significant system responsiveness criterion is that for emergency messages.\nd with emergency messages, whether originating at the\nIt is desirable that the delay asso\ned only by the propagation path delay associated with\nairplane or at the ATC center, b\nthe satellite relay, or essentially zero seconds.

The average\nmessage delay time has been found to be less than 1,2, and 7 seconds, respectively, for the\nlatter three categories.\n\n251\n\n9.4 Growth Potenti\nThe ultimate cost and usefulness of the aeronautical satellite system is related to its\ncapability for smooth evolutionary growth in both size and performance. While requirements for increased size can often be predicted, technological advances leading to improved\nperformance are difficult to foresee with any degree of certainty. However, it is imperative\nthat the system designer acknowledge general technological trends in order to obviate unnecessary and premature obsolescence of the system.\nThe advantages of a satellite communications/surveillance system for the aeronautical\nservices are such that an eventual requirement will exist for complete global coverage. However, due to problems inherent in obtaining coverage of the polar regions from a synchronous\nsatellite system, it is unlikely that system area coverage will extend to latitudes above 70".\nThus, the goal for potential system expansion is that it must be capable of a smooth evolutionary growth in size to cover the entire circumference of the earth at latitudes below 70\'.\nPresent trends in communication system design are toward higher data rates, greater\nflexibility due to improved multiple-access techniques, higher reliability both from an equipment and operational standpoint, and a higher degree of system efficiency due to implementation of advanced subsystem integration techniques and application of automatic control\ntechniques. The possibility of incorporating advanced techniques into the aeronautical satellite communications/surveillance system as future growth items has been considered. This required an evaluation of such factors as available bandwidth, receiver sensitivity, transmitter\npower, and antenna performance as they relate to future growth potential.\n9.5 Compatibility\n\nCompatibility is the ability of one system to operate in conjunction with another\ng the performance of either.\n\nmost econom\n\n252\n\ncean air traffic cont\nefficient system compatib\nintroduction of the satell\nt will allow a smoo\nmajor compatibil\n\nnce system must be\nthe existing air\ne system is the\n\ncapability of integrating with the existing-air traffic control complex in a smooth evolutionary manner, and the interface capability for transferring the airborne terminal from the\nsatellite system into other portions of the air traffic control system, such as air route traffic\ncontrol centers, where applicable.\nAnother major compatibility area is that related to the airframe environment. The\nsystem must be capable of interfacing with existing airborne electronic equipment where\nrequired and must have the capability of being integrated into the airframe complex without\nsignificantly degrading either the performance of the airplane or associated airborne avionic\nsystems.\n\n9.6 Capacity Criteria\nThe capacity of the system is defined as the maximum number of airborne terminals\nthat the system can accommodate or, indirectly, the allowable information rate of the\nsystem.\nThe capacity of the aeronautical satellite communications/surveillance system must be\nsufficiently large to satisfy the operational requirements of the North Atlantic Air Traffic\nControl System during peak operational periods.\nIn order that a meaningful minimum capacity value for the system may be generated,\na detailed analysis of North Atlantic Air Traffic communications/surveillance message loading\nwas performed to determine total information transfer statistics. A minimum system capacity\ngoal for the system was established as 150 airborne terminals during peak traffic periods in\nthe principal area (1 0 5 \' W) through 1980. In addition, the system must have the capacity\n-0\nof handling a minimum of 750 messages per hour during the busy season peak hours.

This constraint\nimposes a satellite antenna pointing requirement of +0.9lo, as found from eq. (A2), or\nk0.64\' in each of two axes. Pointing to this accuracy is within the expected state of the art\nfor an operational mission in the 1970\'s. The corresponding mispointing loss to the ATC\ncenter for the higher uplink frequency is then 1.8 dB, also from eq.

For an assumed satellite antenna axial ratio of 2 dB, same sense rotation, and\nmaximum (909 skew angle, eq.

If the\nantenna must be mounted sufficiently far (greater than 15 or 20 feet) from the central\nequipment bay so that excessive line loss would be a problem, the preamplifier may be\nplaced out of the bay close to the antenna. For an operational system, where a very reliable\nand rugged transistor preamplifier is recommended, placement near the antenna feed, or\neven integrated into the antenna module, would be possible and cause minimal problems.\nFor the experimental phase of the program, the presence of a satellite with less power and\ngain than that of an operational-system satellite may require compensation at the aircraft\nexperimental terminal in the form of lower noise temperature provided by an uncooledparamp preamplifier. During the experimental program, placement of the paramp within\nthe cabin near the antenna would be feasible, so that circuit loss could be held to 1 dB\nmaximum. These circuit loss considerations are discussed further in Sec. 2.3 of vol.

The receiver will be in the central equipment bay, as much as 100 feet from the preamplifier.

For antenna mounting off top center,\nTs = 287OK and overall noise spectral density is -204.0 dBW/Hz.\nNoise performance is improved slightly if a directional antenna is used at the aircraft,\nsince antenna temperature is lower for this case than for a broad-coverage antenna. From\nthe noise analysis of Sec. 7.0, for a +lO-dB beam pointed above the horizon on the aircraft,\nantenna noise temperature is about 30\xc2\xb0K. For a transistor preamplifier, overall system\nnoise temperature would be 581\'K and noise spectral density -200.9 dBW/Hz. The\ncorresponding values for a paramp preamplifier would be 16OOK and -206.6 dBW/Hz.\nNoise performance is summarized in table A 1 for thevarious antenna and preamplifier\noptions at the aircraft terminal.\n\nItem 22 - carrier modulation loss: Modulation losses are determined by an\noptimization procedure, discussed in ref. 15, which balances channels of the link under\nworst-case conditions and results in a minimum-power system. For the link considered,\nwhere the carrier is phase modulated by a sinusoidal data subcarrier and five tone subcarriers,\nthe phase deviations by which each subcarrier modulates the carrier are found from considerations of the worst-case (maximum) required signal-to-noise density ratios (S/No) for\nthe channels. These are tabulated below, in decibels.\nCarrier:\n\nS/No\n\n= ~ B L S/N\n+\n= +17.4 dB\n\n+\n\n10.0 dB\n\n= +27.4dB\n\nData:\n\nS/No = bit rate\n\n+\n\n= +17.4dB\n\nST/(N/B)\n\n+\n\n10.4dB\n\n= 27.8 dB\n\nTones(5):\n\nSINo\n\n+ S/N\n= +33.8 dB - 13.0 dB\n= filter BW\n\n= +20.8 dB\n\nThe optimization procedure then permits the determination of each phase deviation (4)\nfor optimum power balance.

The carrier channel has slightly more power than required\nafter optimization, whereas the data and tone channels balance and threshold simultaneously.\n\nItem 24 - carrier tracking noise bandwidth, ~ B L :The carrier tracking loop bandwidth\nis determined from consideration of the acquisition procedure at the aircraft receiver. It is\nrequired that acquisition be accomplished to 3O- probability within 90 seconds as discussed\nin Sec. 3.1.6.1. The surveillance signal will be continuously present for tracking by the\naircraft, with response from the aircraft to the ATC being made only once every 3 minutes.\nFrequency uncertainty of the incoming carrier A f as seen by the aircraft receiver will\ncomprise three factors: Doppler shift between aircraft and satellite, uncertainty caused by\nthe satellite repeater drift, and uncertainty caused by drift of the aircraft receiver downconversion VCO. The first two uncertainities are obtained from table 3; receiver VCO\nuncertainty for a long-term VCO instability of f 10-6 (presently available in commercial aircraft communications equipment) and 1560-MHz worst-case downlink frequency is\n*1560 Hz. Total uncertainty A f is thus 11.5 kHz:\nDoppler shift\n\n*4090 Hz\n\nSatellite repeater drift\n\n* 100 Hz\n\nReceiver VCO drift\n\n*1560 Hz\n*5750 Hz\n\nThe sweep rate f required to realize the 90-second acquisition time with 11.5-kHz\nfrequency uncertainty A f must then be\n\nIn radians, LJ = 804 radlsec2. This sweep rate can be related to loop natural frequency\nw n and to the bias tracking error in the loop \xe2\x82\xacla due to the acceleration of the frequency\nsweep ramp by the expression from Gardner (ref. 110):\nci\n-\n\n\xe2\x82\xacla,rad = w n\n\n2 62\n\n=\n\n2\n\nFurther, a n can be converted to loop noise bandwidth ~ B L\nusing the expression, also\nfrom Gardner (ref. 1 lo),\n~ B L , H z=\nwhere E, is the loop damping factor. For the common critical-damping case of\n= 0.707,\n\nso that\n\nAn additional error 8no exists in the loop due to rms noise jitter, which is a function of\ninput S/N as described by the expressions\n=\n\nS/N > 10\n\n-d$S\n\n@,,(rad)\n\nS/Ndl\n\nwhere 8 no is graphed in fig. 3. Since peak jitter frequently exceeds rms jitter, a confidence\nfactor u is used with 8 no to relate it to probability. The 3 u value of 8 no is thus\n38 no, so that jitter will be below this value 98.7% of the time.\nThe total phase error due to the bias tracking error and the random noise error is then\n\net\n\n=\n\nThe total allowable phase error in the tracking loop is theoretically 90"(~/2), which\nat\npoint the loop loses lock. For initial acquisition, however, a smaller total phase error should\nbe used, since the capture range of the loop is generally not as great the tracking range once\nlock has occurred. For this reason, a conservative total phase error of 1 radian is assumed,\nso that, for 3 u probability of acquisition,\n\net\n\n=\n\nea +\n\n3en0\n\n= 7 1 4 / ( 2 B ~ )f 38,,\n~\n\n5\n\n1 radian\n\n(A 18)\n\nSince 8 a is a function of ~ B L ,and On0 is a function of SIN in ~ B L ,it is possible to\nfind the combination of these two error parameters that minimizes the required S/No in\nthe carrier channel, which is the dB sum of ~ B L SIN. For a l-radian total error, the\nand\nminimum SIN, occurs at about a SIN of 10 dB, which corresponds to a ~ B L 55 H .\nof\nz\nThese values will thus be used in the analysis to provide a 3rr probability of acquisition.\nThe performance of the 55-Hz loop can be evaluated for loss of lock susceptibility\nonce acquisition is made. The worst-case acceleration for an SST aircraft will occur at\ntakeoff, where accelerations of 8.7 ft/sec2 will exist.

Phase\nerror on the carrier reference must be kept small enough, however, so as not to interfere\nwith the demodulation. A S/N of 10 dB in the carrier loop is reasonable for this purpose,\nresulting in a l o phase error of 13\'.\nItem 31 - data channel modulation loss: See item 22.\n\n-\n\nItem 33 bit rate: Discussion of surveillance link data requirements is presented in\nSec. 4.2, where a bit rate of 55 bps is found to be adequate on the forward link.
