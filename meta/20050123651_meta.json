The December 21 launch of the 232-ft. vehicle on 2 million lb. thrust marked the largest all-liquid expendable booster flown since the last Saturn V in 1973. A second Delta IV Heavy mission is scheduled for this summer carrying a U.S. Air Force missile warning satellite. The first launch carried a dummy payload. Boeing wants NASA to consider the Delta IV Heavy for manned CEV missions, but is also pushing the Heavy for unmanned exploration launch roles. One Delta IV Medium version could also be a CEV player. Boeing says even modest upgrades could double the Delta Heavy's Earth orbit capability to more than 50 metric tons, including being able to fire up to 20 metric tons on escape trajectories to Mars.", "title": "Trial by Fire", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-22T19:58:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20050123651, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Covault, Craig"}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Kennedy Space Center", "location": "Cocoa Beach, FL, United States"}}, "id": "dec5b2bfbf994f239b959869299ee7ce"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Reprint (Version printed in journal)", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-23T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20050123651, "publications": [{"volume": "162", "submissionId": 20050123651, "issue": "6", "issn": "0005-2175", "publisher": "Aviation Week and Space Technology", "id": "602edd6238044a7fad611986402f2a0f", "publicationName": "Aviation Week and Space Technology", "publicationDate": "2005-02-21T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
