fostered active involvement in basic scientific research.\n\nCollege teachers with scientific backgrounds spend\n\na substantial amount of time engaged in other activities which do\nnot utilize their research capabilities and skills.\n\nThe NASA-\n\nHampton Institute Summer Research Fellowship Program offers capable\nscientists and engineers at traditionally Black institutions an\nopportunity to participate in research activities in an environment\nat the Langley Research Center where basic research is of primary\nimportance.\nThe Summer Research Fellowship Program has been specifically\ndesigned to assist these faculty members in identifying areas of\nresearch which correlate positively with their individual interests\nand capabilities.\n\nIt is also designed to help them to initiate\n\nviable research which increases their technical knowledge and expertise~\n\nand their knowledge about how research efforts at their\n\ninstitutions might be increased.\nPrograms similar to the Summer Research Fellowship Program\nalso provide opportunities for university faculty members to\nengage in summer research\n\nactivities~\n\nbut these programs lack\n\nsignificant participation from faculty members representating\npredominantly Black institutions.\n\nThis Program actively solicits\n\nminority institutional involvement by providing fellowships which\nallow selected faculty members to become engaged in on-going research\nfor ten weeks during the summer at Langley Research Center.\n\nThis\n\nexperience should increase the quality and impact the quantity of\nresearch performed on these\n\ncampuses~ thus~\n\ngiving more ninority\n\nstudents the opportunity to participate in research activities.\nThrough these\n\nactivities~\n\nbetter research techniques will be\n\ndeveloped by students and faculty\n\nmembers~ therefore~\n\na broader\n\nand more proficient base will be established from which capable\nscientists and engineers can be selected.\n\nObjectives\n\nThe Summer Research Fellowship Program involves professors\nfrom predominantly Black colleges and universities in research\nactivities at the Langley Research Center.\n\nThe program is\n\nspecifically designed to:\n1)\n\n2)\n\nImpact the academic programs of participating\ninstitutions through modifications resulting\nfrom changing emphasis in an academic discipline due to research;\n\n3)\n\nPromote more cooperative ventures between\nparticipating institutions and the Langley\nResearch Center;\n\n4)\n\n2\n\nProvide faculty members from participating\ninstitutions the opportunity to identify\nactive research areas appropriate to their\ninterests and capabilities;\n\nIncrease the resource base which provides\nproficient scientists and engineers.\n\nParticipating Institutions\nInitially, the Program was a pilot program and only twenty-five of the\npredominantly Black institutions were included.\n\nSince then three other in-\n\nstitutions have participated and next year, all predominantly Black institutions will be asked to participate.\nAtlanta University\n\nAtlanta, Georgia\n\nBennett College\n\nGreensboro, North Carolina\n\nClark College\n\nAtlanta,

Duberg, Dr. Wayne Erickson, Dr. William H.\n~ichael,\n\nMr. Ernald B. Graves, Mr. Franklin C.Owens (all at the Langley Research\n\n8enter) and the program coordinator met to select ten participants and two alter~ates.\n\n~he\n\ntwelve persons were notified by letter of their status after each of\n\nthe ten selected to participate had been notified by telephone.\n\nWritten accept-\n\nances were received by the program coordinator before March 15, 1979.\n\nAll ten\n\n?ersons accepted.\nDuring April 1979, the program was awarded additional funds to support an\n3leventh participant and the first alternate accepted the invitation to\nparticipate.\n~ach\n\nA letter containing more details about the summer was sent to\n\nof the eleven Fellows.\n\nThe letter included information such as the name\n\nJf the Langley Associate, the title of the project to be investigated and housing\navailability.\n\nA final letter was sent in May 1979 to inform Fellows about time\n\nand place of the initial meeting.\nThe initial meeting was held jointly with the ASEE groups on June 4, 1979,\nafter which the Fellows went to their respective divisions to begin work on their\n?rojects.\n\nOne Fellow was away from the Center for more than three weeks, but did\n\nnake up for two weeks by arriving two weeks early.\n\n5\n\nThe Fellows agreed to eat lunch together each Wednesday for the purpose\nof\n\ngetti~g\n\nbetter acquainted and discussing mutual program and instructional\n\nconcerns and achievements.\n\nDuring the first week, the program coordinator\n\ninvited the Fellows to her horne, along with a former participant in the\nprogram and a Langley employee, to discuss the objectives of the Program,\nhow to avoid certain problems, the programs and activities at the Center\nwhich could impact the Fellows\' various academic programs and any concerns\nwhich the Fellows voiced.\n\nThe Fellows were also informed of the lectures\n\nwhich were a part of the ASEE Program.\nDuring the fourth week of June the program coordinator began the first\nof two visits to each Fellow to ascertain the goals for the summer, progress\nbeing made and any problems which had developed.\n\nAll reported progress and\n\nenthusiasm for their respective project during the first visit.\n\nThe second\n\nvisit was made during the eleventh week, again to ascertain the progress\nwhich had been made.\nEach Fellow submitted a written synopsis of his work on August 1, 1979,\nand gave an oral presentation on August 6, 1979, to some Langley Research\nCenter personnel, to other Fellows and Langley Associates.\n1979, the group conducted an evaluation of the\n\n6\n\np~ogram.\n\nOn August 10,\n\nSummer Research Fellowship Activities Qysle\n\nSet Goals\nSelect\nResearch Topics\n\n~\n\n(October)\n\nSubmit\nFinal Report\n(September)\n\nIdentify Eligible\nFaculty Hembers\n\n(N\\,er)\n\nI\n\nDisseminate\nInformation\n(December)\n\nEvaluate Program\n(August)\n\n1\n\nConduct-On-Site\nVisits\n(January)\n\nCoordinate Program\nActivities\n(June-August)\n\n/\n\n\\\n\nFinalize Program\nDetails\n(April)\n\nReview Applications\n(Fellow Selection)\n(February)\n\nAward Fellowships\n(Participant Notification)\n(K.\'lrch)\n\n7\n\nco\n\n1979 SRFP\nName & Address\n\nAge\n\nJohn w.\n2201 Crestview St.\nP.

Bales\nNASA-HI 1979 Fellow\nFlight Dynamics and\nControl Division\n\nIn anticipation of the construction of large space platforms for antenna\narrays and scientific experiment packages, NASA is interested in the possible\nuse of construction robots.\n\nIt would be the task of such robots to assist\n\nhuman construction workers in the assembly of these large space structures.\nIn order to handle such a complex task it will be necessary for such robots\nto have a sophisticated visual system, including depth perception.\nsearch this summer has centered on two primary tasks:\n\nThe re-\n\na survey of the state\n\nof the art in pattern recognition and computer-assisted scene analysis, and\nthe identification of a candidate visual system for a space platform construction robot.\nThe most severe restriction on the visual system is the fact that it must\noperate in real-time.\nproblem:\n\nThis eliminates many sophisticated approaches to the\n\nthey simply require too much computer time.\n\nrequirement places additional constraints.\n\nThe depth perception\n\nAfter a thorough survey of possible\n\nsystems, attention was narrowed to a candidate system which provides the requisite\ndepth information and simultaneously reduces the amount of data to be processed.\nThis system operates with a single camera in conjunction with a 1asar rangefinder.\nThe first generation of "sighted" robots will probably operate with this type of\nsystem.\n\n11\n\nMACSYMA Usage\nAT NASA-LaRC\n\nSandra J. DeLoatch\nNASA-HI 1979 Fellow\nAnalysis and Computation\nDivision\n\nMACSYMA is a large and versatile computer programing system written in\nLISP and is specifically designed for\nmanipulations.\n\nperformi~g\n\nsymbolic as well as numerical\n\nMACSYMA has been under development since 1969 by MIT\'s Labora-\n\ntory for C0mputer Science in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and it is processed on\na PDP-lO computer.\n\nMACSYMA is accessible to NASA users by direct long distance\n\ntelephone or via the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) Network.\n\nMACSYMA\'s\n\nnumerous capabilities and features for symbolic processing of mathematical\npressions include:\n\nex~\n\ntwo-dimensional display of expressions, differentiation,\n\nintegration, polynomial factorization, solution of algebraic equations.\n\ntrigono~\n\nmetric function manipulation, matrix and tensor manipulation, Taylor series\n\nex-\n\npansion, Laplace trnnsforms, and curve plotting.\nThis summer\'s objectives were to investigate the use of MACSYMA at NASA-LaRC\nand to examine the MACSYMA documentation available for NASA-LaRC users.\n\nMore\n\nspecifically, the fundamental tasks were to understand the capabilities of MACSYMA;\nuncover difficulties in accessing MACSYMA from NASA-LaRC terminals; examine MACSYMA\nusage in terms of the number of applications and capabilities employed; and recommend usage of additional features and documentation.\nPursuant to the first task, an intensive study of MACSYMA documentation was\ninitiated.\n\nAttending the 1979 MACASYMA User\'s Conference (June 20-21, 1979) and\n\nassisting NASA--LaRC individuals in need of MACSYMA\'s capabilities provided additional\nexperiences which proved beneficial in learning to use the system.\nExperimentation with various features and capabilities of MACSY1ffi led to the\ndiscovery of a number of problems and inconsistencies encountered during the access\nand use of the system via NASA-LaRC terminals.\n\nAs a result, a document was prepared\n\nwhich provides a detailed and accurate treatment of the MACSYMA LOGIN procedure.\nIn order to obtain data regarding the use of MACSYMA at NASA--LaRC, a survey\ninstrument was prepared and distributed to experienced users.\n\nAlthough most at the\n\nsurvey participants had previously employed MACSYMA\'s capabilities in a variety of\napplications, their use of the\n\n12\n\nsyst~m\n\nin 1979 has been limited.\n\nThe survey data also\n\nquestions the adequacy of MACSYMA documentation, since the majority of respondents\nindicated that some portion of the documentation should be expanded or made clearer.\nSome of the respondents suggested that alternatives to the present documentation,\nand expansion of some capabilities might increase their use of MACSYMA.\nThe survey results and personal experimentation indicate that MACSYMA users\nat NASA-LaRC would benefit from the following additions to present MACSYMA documentation and capabilities:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nNASA-LaRC Users\' Manual which focuses on frequently\nused capabilities and commands, using sophisticated\nexamples and illustrations of syntax.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nA\n\nY~CSYMA\n\nnewsletter which features system updates,\n\nillustrations of current applications of MACSYMA at\nNASA-LaRC, and exchange of information among users.\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nA more comprehensive set of integral solvers, and\nadditional storage capacity.\n\n13\n\nThe Conjugate Gradient Method\n\nJohn A.

Koons\nNASA-HI 1979 Fellow\nSpace Systems Division\n\nTemperature Effect of the\nPhotoe1ectrochemical Oxidation\nof Water on Semiconductor\nElectrodes\n\nThe use of solar irradiation for the (photo)e1ectolysis of water to\nhydrogen, with the consequent synthesis of a valuable fuel, is, in principle, possible by means of a phenomenon first reported in 1972.\n\nUpon\n\n\' Ti0 ) electrons\n2\n3\nare promoted to the conduction band at an energy level high enough for\nthe irradiation of certain semiconductors(e.g. SrTi0\n\nthe reduction of water to H \' whereas the hole left at the level of the\n2\nvalence band can oxidize water to oxygen. Thus, there exists the possibility of constructing photoe1ectrochemica1 cells in which the energy is\nprovided wholly or partly by sunlight.\n\nThe disadvantages of the system\n\n3re that the bandgaps of stable semiconductors are so large that much of\nthe available energy is wasted and that the levels of the bands in the\nsemiconductors do not well match those corresponding to the electrochemical\nreactions in solution.\n\nTemperature is among the factors that affect the\n\npositions of the various energy levels.\nThis work involved a study of the effect of temperature on the oxidation of water at Ti0\n\nand SrTi0 semiconductors. Specifically, it was\n2\n3\nthe measurement of current-voltage curves for the oxidation of water on\n\nthose electrodes while they were immersed in aqueous NaOH.\n\nThe short\n\nduration of the program does not allow the design and the construction by\nspecialists of a cell adequate for the making of current-voltage measurements in aqueous solutions at temperatures up to 210 C.\n\nThus, such an\n\naparatus from available material, partly scrap, was fabricated and developed.\nThe cell, in its present from, consists of a stainless steel vessel,\noriginally intended for vacuum use, with a quartz window and with a heating\nelement attached to its base.\n\nIt has been modified to allow the feed-through\n\nof three electrical leads and to allow the connection of a source of inert gas\n6\nby means of which controllable pressures up to 2.1 x 10 Pa(300 psi) can be\napplied to the system.\nIn the course of testing, problems such as condensation on the window and\nroof of the cell, thermal lag in the provision of heat to the solution and\n\nsub~\n\nsequent1y to the thermocouple, lack of integrity in the insulating system for\n\n20\n\nthe semiconductor, current loss and feedback via the thermocou?le, and\ndiverse comparable difficulties have been eliminated.\n\nIn its present\n\nform the system requires that the semiconductor be in the shape of a\ndisc approximately 0.008 m in diameter.\n\nStock for the construction of\n\nthese from SrTi0\nTiO\n\nis not presently available, but measurements with\n3\nelectrodes have been made at temperatures up to Z06\xc2\xb0C. Limited\n\nZ\nresults obtained thus far do not support the expectation that the\nefficiency of photooxidation of water on TiO\nably with increasing temperature.\n\nwould increase appreciZ\nThe feasibility of routinely obtain-\n\ning measurements up to at least ZOOoC has been demonstrated.\n\nThe work\n\nwill continue with other semiconductors and with attention to the matter\nof the precise measurement of the intensity of light incident on the\nsemiconductor.\n\n21\n\nCalibration of the Quartz Crystal\nMicrobalance (QCM) As An Aerosol\nImpactor\n\nNathaniel Matthews\nNASA-HI 1979 Fellow\nInstrument Research\nDivision\n\nIn recent years there has been an increased interest among aerosol scientists\nin the in situ measurement of particulate aerosols. This interest is primarily in\naerosol size distribution, concentration and chemical composition\n\nsince these are\n\nthe parameters important to the role aerosols play in radiative transfer.\n\nThese\n\nparameters are also important to human health and they affect 3cceptable air\nquality conditions.\n\nFor example, the size distribution governs weather particles\n\nthat are capable of being inhaled and trapped in the human respiratory system or\nfiltered out before reaching the lower respiratory tract. A variety of sensors developed to measure and characterize aerosols, and their measurement techniques can\nbe found in the literature.\n\nA fairly unique sensor, a Quartz Crystal Microbalance\n\n(QCM) cascade impactor, has been used extensively in the Aerosol Measurement Research Branch (AMRB) at NASA\'s Langley Research Center.\n\nThe QCM has been flown\n\non several types of aircraft, including the NASA U-2 which reaches altitudes up\nto 70,000 ft.\n\nMeasurements have been made on the stratospheric aerosols, on the\n\nambient tropospheric aerosols, in the exhaust plumes from rocket motors and in\nthe exhaust plumes from active volcanoes.\n\nThe success of these measurements in-\n\ndicate that the QCM is useful under a wide variety of operating conditions.\nThe currently used values for sizing characteristics and mass sensitivity of\nthe QCM are calculated from design parameters.\n\nAlthough these values are derived\n\nfrom fundamental physical principles it is still essential to perform laboratory\ncalibrations on the instrument in order to validate experimental measurements,\ntherefore, an effort was begun to develop calibration techniques for the QCM in\nthe AMRB particle laboratory this summer.\nThe QCM is a multistage cascade impactor which measures the size distribution\nof particulate aerosols (mass concentration as a function of particle diameter) by\ncombining the piezoelectric principle for sensing mass with the impaction technique\nfor classifying aerosols by aerodynamic size.\n\nEach stage of the cascade collects\n\nparticles over a different size interval starting at a mean diameter of approxiin the first stage down to a 0.05 ~m in the tenth stage for spherical\nparticles with a mass density of 2 gm/cm3 . The impaction surface in each stage is\n\nmately 25\n\n22\n\n~m\n\na quartz crystal which is the collection element of a piezoelectric microbalance\nused for sensing the mass of the aerosols electronically.\nThe sizing characteristics of the QCM over a narrow size range (from\ndiameter to\n\n2-~m\n\n0.3~m\n\ndinmeter) were determined in the laboratory by introducing mono-\n\ndisperse latex spherical particles of known size into the sensor and observing\nthe response in each stage of the cascade.\n\nLatex particles with diameters of\n\n0.312, 0.714, 1.011, and 2.020 micrometers were genernted with a Royco 256\nparticle generntor which employs the nebalizer method.\n\nThe monodispersity of the\n\ngenerated particles was checked with an optical particle counter (Particle Data\nSystems FSSP-lOO) to assure that no doublets were present.\n\n23\n\nShekhar Munava11i\nNASA-HI 1979 Fellow\nMarine and Applications\nTechnology Division\n\nNatural Organics of the Dismal Swamp:\nA Profile of the Naturally Occurring\nHydrocarbons\n\nIn recent years, considerable attention has been focused on the presence\nof the natural organics in our environment and their overall impact on the\ndelicate balance of our ecosystem.\nhas served as the "dumping grou:ld\nprocesses.\n\nll\n\nFor millions of years, our environment\nof natural organics emitted by natural\n\nHowever, until 1970 the significance of their impact/contribution\n\nto our environmental problem was not recognized.\nMaybe this was due to our preoccupation with anthropogenic organics.\n\nRe-\n\ncently, it has been estimated that total natural organics by far exceed the\ntotal anthropogenic organics, the natural organics amounting to 83 to 99.8\npercent of the total organics of our e:lvironment.\nThe natural organics are derived from a variety of sources-\'-name1y, plants,\nbiological activity and decay, forest fires, volcanoes, marine aerosol, and geochemical/geothermal pyrolysis.\n\nHowever, there is very little agreement on the\n\nestimates of the quantity emitted by the natural sources, particularly the plants.\nPlants are considered to be the principal contributors of the natural organics.\nIn fact, the relative impact of the hydrocarbons given off by the plants has been\nquestioned.\nIn one study, a striking similarity between the constituents of the natural\nand anthropogenic organics has been found.\n\nAbout 70 percent of the plants ex-\n\namined were found to be terpene emitters in another study.\ncently concluded study states that the insignificantly low\n\nAnd again, a rel~vels\n\nof naturally\n\noccurring hydrocarbons cannot possibly contribute to the production of significant amounts of ozone.\n\nIn light of these apparently contradictory opinions, the\n\nproposed photochemical mechanism for the reaction between the natural terpene\nhydrocarbons and the nitrogen oxides requires further investigation.\nAnother important aspect, not as yet answered, is the role and contribution\nof the green foliage to the natural hydrocarbon pool of our environment.\n\nThe\n\ngreen foliage is covered with a waterproofing layer of higher hydrocarbons,\nmore commonly known as leaf-wax.\n\nVery little is known about what happens to it\n\nwhen it is constantly irradiated by the sunlight and whether these hydrocarbons\n\n24\n\nescape into our environment and enrich the overall pool of hydrocarbons, Although it has been observed that some simple hydrocarbons serve as the sole\nsource of carbon for lower organisms like algae, practically very little\ninformation is available on the fate of these hydrocarbons and the nature of\ntheir biodegradation.\n\nThus, our present day knowledge of the global cycle\n\nof the NMHC of our environment is very limited.\nThe present investigation is a part of the Dismal Swamp segment of the\nSEV-UP project being conducted by the NASA-\xc2\xb7LaRC,\n\nIt is designed to answer\n\nsome of the pertinent questions relative to the information of natural organics\nand their involvement in the photo-production of ozone, the influence of the\nbiota on the levels and fate of these substances, the role of the moisture,\nparticulate matter and other natural agents in the transportation of the\nnatural hydrocarbons, and the composition and characterization of the individual\nspecies of the natural hydrocarbons.\nOur goals for the la-week period were to develop a reliable analytical\narrangement, to organize sampling sites and sample collection protocols, and\nto coordinate our activities with the NASA SEV-UP project for monitoring air\nsamples from 500 feet up in the air.\n\n25\n\nA.\n\nShien-Sen Perng\nNASA-HI 1979 Fellow\nMarine and Application\nTechnology Division\n\nA Study in the Variation of\nRemote Radiance Measures and\nSea-Truth Water-Quality\nParameters in the James River\n\nFor the purpose of environment assessment or marine life preservation,\nwater-quality parameters, such as sediment, chlorophyll\n\n~,\n\ntannis and lignins,\n\nhave to be constantly monitored in the river as well as in the ocean.\n\nDue to\n\nthe overwhelming volume of water body, in situ measures of these parameters\nare costly and time consuming, even for a small sample size.\n\nIt has been a\n\nlarge effort of NASA, EPA and other concerned agencies or institutions to\ndevelop effective remote sensor techniques and analysis methodologies to\nestimate the mix and densities of water-quality parameters.\nMultispectral scanners were used to measure the radiance or reflectance\nunder different wavelengths.\n\nThis is incorporated with the in situ measures of\n\nwater-quality parameters to establish the predicting model for the parameter.\nSo far, only one-parameter models have been considered.\n\nLinear (regression)\n\nmodels were assumed relating that parameter to one or more bands in radiance data.\nTo develop multiparameter models, the interrelationship of the water-quality\nparameters and their relationships with radiance measures need to be examined more\nclosely.\n\nIt is desired to find variables which cause the fluctuation of radiance\n\nintensities and to group the water-quality parameters according to their variation\npattern.\nWe use the data of a James River experiment undertaken on May 17, 1977.\nRadiance intensities were remotely sensed under 10 bands, ranging from 380 to\n1060 nm.\n\nGround-truth measures were taken for 17 water-quality parameters.\n\nBoth\n\nremote sensor and ground-truth data were taken simultaneously at six different\nhours of the day.\nIt was found that the time of the day explains a large portion of the variance\nof radiance intensities.\n\nThe R-square values range from 0.511 (band 9) to as high\n\nas 0.865 (band 1) depending on band number (wavelength).\n\nAs expected, some bands\n\nare more sensitive to specific water-quality parameters.\n\nFor instance, bands 4\n\nthrough 7 are very responsive to tannis and lignins.\n\n26\n\nIt was further found that with 74.8% variance explained, 17 waterquality parameters can be reduced to five factors (dimensions).\n\nThus,\n\nparameters can be divided into five groups according to their association\nwith factors.\n\nFor parameters in the same group the variation patterns are\n\nsimilar.\n\n27\n\nB.\n\nA Study in the Correlational Structures of Monthly Ozone Averages\nRecently, concentration of ultraviolet-absorbing ozone in the stratos-\n\nphere has been a great concern of atmospheric scientists.\n\nTo understand the\n\nozone layer better, it was decided to examine the correlational structures\nof monthly ozone averages of some ozone stations around the world.\nFirst, the capability of reducing the dimensionality of the data was\nexamined,then, the meaning represented by these lower dimension factors was\ndetermined.\n\nTwo data sets consisting of 14 and 35 stations, respectively\n\nwere analyzed.\nIt was found that the dimensionality of the data can be dramatically\nreduced.\n\nFor instance, three factors accounted for 89.7 percent of the\n\nvariance in the data of 14 stations and six factors accounted for 89.9\npercent in 35 stations.\nIt was also found that, in the 14-station case, two most important factors\nrepresent, respectively, stations away from the equator and stations around the\nequator.\n\nIn the 35-station case, the same is true for the first two factors,\n\nbut there is a noticeable third factor representing those stations with somewhat irregular variations.\nIn addition, analysis of variance was undertaken among 35 stations.\n\nExcept\n\nfar a few stations, seasonal variation accounted for 60 to 93 percent of the total\nvariance.\n\nThe exceptional stations concide with those represented by the third\n\nfactor in 35-station factor analysis of the last paragraph.\n\n28\n\nEffect of Load

Experimental results\nshow an apparent modulus ranging from 7% too low at ~=l to 7% too high at s=0.25.\n\n30\n\nOPTIM--A Computer Program for Generating\nOptimum Vertical Flight Profile\n\nJohn Wiggs\nNASA-HI 1979 Fellow\nFlight Mechanics Division\n\nThis work was concerned with a sensitivity analysis of data changes made\nto a computer program which was developed at the Ames Research Center and\nmodified for the Langley Research Center by Analytical Mechanics Associates,\na NASA Contractor.\n\nThis program, OPTIM, synthesizes various types of cost-\n\noptimal trajectories (1.\n\nDirect Operating Costs, 2.\n\nFuel Costs, and 3.\n\nTime\n\nCosts) for the Boeing 727 aircraft.\nThe underlying theory of the program OPTIM is based on the application of\nmethods of the calculus of variations and there are questions which are\nresolved in this area.\n\nun~\n\nThe program allows optimization utilizing one cQntrol\n\n(indicated airspeed) or two controls (indicated airspeed and thrust).\n\nIt allows\n\nthe input of a vertical wind profile, a 250-knot indicated airspeed limit below\n10,000 ft and a two-part (cruise, descent) or a three-part\ndescent) trajectory.\n\n(~scent,\n\ncruise,\n\nIt also allows the input of the initial altitude and air-\n\nspeed as well as the final altitude and airspeed.\n\nThe airplane heading is also\n\nvariable.\nAnalysis of the data generated by OPTIM has shown that the cost savings\nbetween using two controls and one control is negligible (less than $O.OI/nmi\nfor ranges up to 1500 nmi).\ncase.\n\nThe analysis\n\nh~s\n\nThus analysis has been restricted to the two-control\n\nalso shown that the removal of the 2S0-knot indicated air-\n\nspeed limit imposed by the Air Traffic Control System below 10,000 ft altitude\nwould have a substantial effect on the cost per nautical mile ($0.14/nmi at 100 mi\nrange down to $0.02/nmi at 1500 nmi range).\n\nThe data have shown that flying an\n\noptimal profile rather than a standard profile can represent a savings of up to\n2.6 percent in direct operating costs.\nThe most important aspect of the analysis is in the area of fuel optimal\nprofiles.\n\nThe study shows that over 1,000 Ibs of fuel can be saved by flying a\n\nfuel optimal profile rather than the standard flight profile for a range of 250\nn.mi.\n\nThis fuel savings is increased to over 2,400 lbs. of fuel for a range of\n\n1500 n.mi.\n\nMoreover, these profiles increase the direct operating costs for these\n\ntwo flights by less than 1% over the standard profile in most cases.\n\n11\n\nFuture work with OPTIM will deal with changing engine data and aerodynamic data so that the program will yield optimal trajectories for the\nNASA 737 aircraft.\n\nComparisons will then be made for several selected\n\ntrajectories determined from this revised OPTIM program with flight tests\nof the NASA 737 Terminal Configured Vehicle.\n\n3L\n\nSome Significant Accomplishments, 1976-1979\n\nThe Summer Research Fellowship Program was initiated at\nthe Langley Research Center during the summer of 1976.\n\nSince\n\nthat time, some significant technical contributions have been\nmade by Summer Research Fellows.\n\nOnly one from each Program year\n\nis briefly discussed below.\n1976\n\nPlans for the future utilization of space\nindicate the necessity for the construction\nof large space structures.\n\nSince strong\n\ngravitational forces will be absent, these\nstructures can be assembled using lightweight materials which are generally flex\'ible.\nDr. Taft H. Broome, a Fellow from Howard\nUniversity, investigated the feasibility\nof stiffening flexible large area space\nstructures by means of cables.\n\nThe scope\n\nof his analysis included cantilevered booms\nof constant cross-section.\n\nDuring that\n\nsummer, Dr. Broome studied six different\ncable stiffening schemes which provided\nacceptable results, and upon returning to\nHoward University for the 1976-1977 academic\nyear, continued this research by studying\nadditional schemes.\n1977\n\nDuring the past several decades, the use of\nthe computer to solve research problems has\nincreased to a level which in some cases demands optimal efficiency in computer utilization.\n\nOne case is the solution of partial\n\ndifferential equations in steady-state time\ndependent problems.\n\n33\n\nDr. William H, Lee, a Fellow from North\nCarolina Central University, developed a\nfinite-difference numerical method which\nreduced, by a factor of ten, the amount\nof computer time generally necessary to\nsolve this class of problems.\n\n1978\n\nCurrently, there is international concern\nabout pollution of the natural environment.\nThe Marine Environments Branch at the Langley\nResearch Center is developing methods of determining various levels of pollution in water.\nAlthough some data is gathered using remotesensing techniques, an effort is also being\nmade to develop mathematical models that may\nbe used to predict pollution levels in water.\nDr. Demetrius D. Venable, a Fellow from St.\nPaul\'s College, developed a computer model\nusing the Monte Carlo technique to evaluate\nsolar radiation scattered from water for a\nnon-homogeneous pollutant profile.\n\nThe use\n\nof this model will reduce the amount of data\ngathered by aircraft to determine the levels\nof water pollution and improve the accuracy\nof predicting pollution levels in water.\n\n1979\n\nGraphite, a material formed from carbon and\nwhich because of its properties of durable\nstrength, light weight, resistance to high\ntemperatures and corrosive chemicals, is\nbeing used in the manufacture of aircraft,\nautomobiles and various consumer goods.\n\nThe\n\nMaterials Research Branch of the Materials\nDivision at Langley Research Center has been\nperforming uniaxial compression tests of high\n\n34\n\nstrength graphite-epoxy laminates and have\nresults showing that Young\'s modulus and\nfracture stress depend upon the s?ecimen\ndimensions.\n\nDr. Robert Reiss, a Fellow\n\nfrom Howard University developed an\nanalytical model that explained the\nexperimental results.\n\nThis model is\n\nrelatively easy to automate, therefore,\nsome predictions will be possible with\nthe use of the computer.\n\n35\n\nAs a result of enthusiasm on the part of the Fellows and few\nproblems to solve by the coordinator, the 1979 Summer Research\nFellowship Program was one of the most stimulating.\n\nOn each of\n\nthe two visits to the Fellows by the Coordinator, minor problems\nhad been encountered, if any, and solutions took very little\neffort.\nAll the Fellows made oral presentations to selected Langley\nResearch Center personnel and some also made oral presentations\nto their respective Branches.\n\nThe presentations were "excellent"\n\nas stated by some of those attending.\nAccording to written and group evaluations, the Fellows think\nthe program is a very good one because it brings together academicians and basic and applied research scientists and engineers to\nwork together in an atmosphere conducive to learning and experimentation.\n\nAs a result, the professors\' students also benefit\n\naccording to the Fellows.\n\nAll reported that they had received\n\nexcellent assistance and cooperation from Langley Associates.\nThe Fellows also stated that the program was very well administered and operated smoothly.\nAll reported interest in seeking an expanded research relationship with NASA and five of the Fellows reported having\nspecifically talked with their respective Langley Associate about\nsubmitting a proposal to continue the work begun during the summer\nor initiating work in a new area.\n\n36\n\nI\n\n1.
