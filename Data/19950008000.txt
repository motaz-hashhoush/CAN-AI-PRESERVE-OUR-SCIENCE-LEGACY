Hot film sensor 12 operates in a\n65 known manner, namely an electrical resistance is develOBJECTS\noped across metal layer 16 via wires 20a and 20b connected to a remotely located resistance developing and\nIt is accordingly an object of the present invention to\nmeasuring device 22 containing a constant temperature\nprovide thermal isolation of a hot film or other type of\n\n3\n\n5,349,85 1\n\nanemometer circuit which heats metal layer 16.As air\nflows over this layer, convective heat transfer occurs\ncausing the layer to cool, i.e., the electrical resistance\nchanges. Measuring device 22 measures the amount of\nvoltage required to maintain a constant temperature 5\nabove the fluid flow temperature. This voltage requirement is indicative of localized shear stress, skin friction\nand flow transition.\nLower thermal isolation sensor 14 likewise comprises\n4\nan upper metal layer 2 having a high temperature 10\ncoefficient of resistance, e.g., nickel, platinum, etc.,\nwhich is adhered to, via an appropriateglue, or suitably\ndeposited onto a lower layer 26 having a high electrical\nresistance such as polyimide film, e.g., Kapton @ film.\n4\nLower layer 26 of lower thermal isolation sensor 1 is 15\nbonded or adhered to an outer surface of aerodynamic\nbody 28 whereas lower layer 18 of the upper hot film\nsensor 12 is bonded or adhered to metal layer of lower\nsensor 14 in a back-to-face orientation, wherein \xe2\x80\x9cback\xe2\x80\x9d\nrefers to the electrical resistive layer of the upper sensor 20\nand \xe2\x80\x9cface\xe2\x80\x9d refers to the metal layer of the lower thermal\nisolator. The adhesion laminate (not shown) should be\nas thin as possible while maintaining an adequate bond,\ne.g., approximately 0.0005\xe2\x80\x9d. The aerodynamic body is\nifi,\nan a r o l wind tunnel model, etc. which is exposed to 25\nan air flow. For convenience,the specific application of\n4\na wind tunnel model is used throughout. Metal layer 2\nis connected via wires 28a and 28b to a controllable\nresistance developing circuit 30. Both lower layers 18\nand 26 may extend past the metal layer in the upstream 30\nand downstream directions per conventional design.\nLower active thermal isolation sensor 14 can be used,\nin several modes. In one mode it is operated with the\nsame response time, thereby having approximately the\nsame temperature as, the upper flow detection sensor 12 35\nto provide dynamic localized heating of the model 28.\nThe respective temperatures of the two sensors would\nnot be identical due to the temperature loss across the\npolyimide layer 18 and the adjoining glue layer. When\nthe relative temperatures of a particular sensor is dis- 40\ncussed, the relative temperature of the metal layer film\nis the quantity under discussion.\nThis localized heating can then be utilized to thermally isolate the upper detection sensor 12 from the\nthermal properties of the model. In a conventional sin- 45\ngle sensor configuration, the single hot film sensor prol\nvides a l the power requirements to sustain both a conductive heat transfer to the model and a convectiveheat\ntransfer to the air flow. In the present invention, lower\nsensor 14 operated in this first mode compensates for 50\nthe model thermal properties by providing the model\nwith the required amount of heat to sustain the conduction rate as in the conventional single sensor configuration to effectively thermally isolate the upper sensor,\nthereby allowing the upper sensor to respond solely to 55\nthe air flow independently of any model thermal properties. In addition, the upper hot film sensor 12 requires\nless power than in a conventional single sensor configuration since the lower sensor 14 is performing the heating of the model.\n60\nWhen the two sensors are operated at the same temperature, the frequency response of the upper sensor 12\nnecessarily decreases. Specifically, data shows that the\nfrequency response obtained with the standard square\nwave test is lower for a model or a r o l with thermally 65\nifi\nifi\ninsulating properties, and higher for a model or a r o l\nwith more thermally conductive properties. The two\nsensors operating at the same temperature have the\n\n4\n\nsame effect as if a single sensor were mounted on a\nifi\nmodel or a r o l having thermally insulating properties,\ni.e., very little conductive heat transfer. The resulting\nlower response frequency may be inadequate for a particular flow phenomena. Accordingly, a second mode\nof operation is provided which establishes an appropriate temperature differencebetween the upper and lower\nsensors to result in the desired upper sensor frequency\nresponse.\nIn this second mode, the lower active thermal isolation sensor 14 locally heats the model 28 to establish a\nfixed boundary temperature for the upper flow detec2\ntion sensor 1 . This fixed boundary temperature controls the amount of heat that is thermally conducted\nfrom the upper sensor 12 to the lower sensor 1 .Since\n4\nthe lower sensor 14is creating a fixed boundary temperature between the upper sensor 12 and the model, the\namount of heat transfer from the upper sensor 12 to the\nlower sensor 14 can be calculated and subtracted from\nthe total heat supplied by the upper flow detection\nsensor 12. The resulting difference is the heat loss from\nthe upper sensor into the air flow via convection. As\nstated before, the voltage representing this convection\nloss is the quantity used to compute local, dynamic\nshear stress, skin friction and flow transition. Al the\nl\nnecessary calculations and control can be implemented\nby the first and second devices 22 and 30 equipped with\nor connected to an appropriate microprocessor. This\nmode thus determines the quantity A T without the need\nfor additional thermocouples while thermally isolating\nthe upper sensor 12.\nIn most applications, the fixed boundary temperatures established by the lower sensor 14 is less than or\nequal to the temperature established by the upper sensor\n12 for studying of the air flow. In the case of a highly\nthermally conductive test material, e.g., an aerodynamic body operated at cooler, high altitude conditions,\nthis fmed boundary temperature can also be slightly\ngreater, e.g., up to approximately 5% greater, than the\ntemperature of the upper sensor.\nThe described sensor configuration and modes of\noperation effectively compensate for thermal losses to\nthe model and thereby reduce power requirements of\n2\nthe upper flow detection sensor 1 .The resulting height\nof the present configuration is still less than that of a\nconventional single sensor configuration having a polyimide layer which is thick enough to effectively thermally isolate the metal layer deposited thereon. In the\npresent invention, any polyimide layer need only have\nsufficient thickness to ensure adequate electrical insulation to avoid shorting between the two metal layers\nwith no regard for the additional thickness necessary to\nachieve thermal insulation. The thickness depicted is\n0.001 inch or approximately 0.02 millimeters. Current\nfabrication techniques at NASA Langley Research\nCenter, Hampton, Va. have reduced the polyimide\nlayer to approximately O.OOO5\xe2\x80\x9d while still providing the\nnecessary electrical insulation. Further reductions in\nthickness may be possible while maintaining the necessary electrical insulation without departing from the\nteachings of the present invention.\n,\nReferring now to FIG. 2 another embodiment of the\npresent invention is shown which is identical to that\nshown in FIG. 1 except for thermal isolator 14. Thermal isolator 14\xe2\x80\x99is disposed such that its metal layer 24\xe2\x80\x99\nis contacting the model surface 28 and its electrical\nresistance layer 26 is facing the electrical resistance\nlayer 18 of hot film sensor 12. In other words, FIG. 2\n\n5\n\n5,349,851\n\nshows a back-to-back arrangement of the isolator and\nsensor whereas FIG. 1 shows a back-to-face arrangement, wherein \xe2\x80\x9cback\xe2\x80\x9d refers to the electrical resistance\nlayer and \xe2\x80\x9cface\xe2\x80\x9d refers to the metal layer. As before, the\nadjoining surfaces of the sensor and the isolator (resistive layers 18 and 26, respectively) are joined by an\nappropriate adhesive laminate, This embodiment is operated in the same two modes as discussed previously\nwith respect to FIG. 1.\nWork done by one of the named applicants indicates\nthat this embodiment does not work well when operated to determine shear stress in the first mode wherein\nthe sensor and isolator are operated at an identical set\npoint temperature. The tests were conducted at a relatively low effective frequency of approximately 1 Hz.\nThe present invention works best at flow frequencies\nexceeding 1 KHz. The test results are discussed in\n\xe2\x80\x9cRise-Time Response of Nickel-Foil-on Kapton-Substrate, Hot-Film Shear Stress Sensors\xe2\x80\x9d, D. C. Reda.\nAh-91-0169,29th Aerospace Sciences Meeting, Jan: 20\n7-10, 1991.\nThe active thermal isolation of the present invention\nis not limited to polyimide films/metal layers confgurations. For example, a hot wire anemometer 40 is shown\nin FIG. 3 and comprises a sensing wire 42 soldered to 25\nand extendingbetween two branching supports 47a and\n4 b Sensing wire 42 is electrically connected to a con7.\nstant temperature anemometer circuit, whereby a\nchange in the voltage supplied to the wire 42 to maintain a constant temperature is indicative of flow charac- 30\nteristics, as described above. Thermal insulation wires\n44a and 44b are respectively spiralled around opposite\nends of the sensing wire 42 and connected via respective lead wire pairs 46a and 46b to a controllable resistance developing circuit 48.\n35\nThe anemometer 40 is conventionally affixed to the\nmodel such that the sensing wire 42 is located slightly\nabove the model surface and accordingly conduction to\nthe branching supports 47u and 47b occurs, increasing\nthe Dower neceSSary to maintain the smcified temmra- 40\nture-of the hot wiri anemometer. To-avoid this problem, wires 44a and 44b are heated and controlled as\ndescribed previously with respect to the lower sensor\n14. Thus, the spiralled wires control conduction from\nthe wire 42to the supports 47a and 47b,and not conduc- 45\ntion to the model as in the previous embodiments. The\nthermal isolation of this embodiment is not as effective\nbecause it does not separate the wire 42 from the supports 474 476.A hot wire is not usually used to measure\nskin friction or shear stress because it is not in direct 50\ncontact with the surface of the model like a film.\nReferring now to FIG. 4,an embodiment is shown\nwherein a so-called \xe2\x80\x9csmart\xe2\x80\x9d semiconductor sensor 50 is\nemployed. Such a s m a r t sensor is described in detail in\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe U e of Silicon Microsensors in Smart Skins for 55\ns\nAerodynamic Research\xe2\x80\x9d by Debra A. Carraway, presented at the 14th International Conference on Instrumentation in Aerospace Facilities, Oct. 27-31, 1991. In\na conventional configuration, the sensor 50 is affied to\na silicon layer having an appropriately etched constant 60\ntemperature circuit, which in turn is affixed to the\nmodel. In this conventional configuration the semiconductor sensor 50 would heat the model surface via the\nsilicon layer, creating a power demand to maintain the\n,\nconstant temperature. As shown in FIG. 4 an active 65\nthermal isolation semiconductor 52 is placed between\nupper semiconductor sensor 50 and etched silicon layer\n54. Lower sensor 52 is operated in the same two modes\n\n6\nas discussed previously to thermally isolate the upper\nsensor 50. As before, the total thickness of the upper\nsensor 50,lower sensor 52 and silicon layer 54 sandwich\nis less than any thermal insulation necessary to thermally isolate a conventional smart sensor configuration\nfrom the model.\nThe present invention offers several advantages over\nthe prior art. Utilizing the first mode of operation, the\nconductive heat transfer to the model from the lower\nsensor or wires can be controlled with the same response time, and therefore the same temperature, as the\nupper hot film sensor or sensing wire in contact with the\nair flow. Utilizing the second mode, a fued boundary\ntemperature is established for the upper sensor or hot\nwire to thermally isolate the upper sensor or hot wire.\nThis allows the response time of the upper sensor or hot\nwire, which is significantly better than the response\ntime of an internally heated model, to be employed.\nBoth modes have resulted in significant reductions in\nthe power requirements necessary to maintain a given\ntemperature of the upper sensor. Since heating requirements for conduction are reduced, the upper sensor and\nhot-wire can be operated at higher temperatures in\nconvective contact with the air flow within the operating lmt of the particular system employed. These\niis\nhigher operating temperatures correspond directly with\nthe ability to detect higher frequencies of boundary\nlayer turbulence. In addition, the thermal isolation of\nthe upper sensor and hot-wire results in the electronic\nfrequency response to a square wave input used in typical anemometer bridge tuning techniques being independent of any model thermal properties.\nThe foregoing results are achieved without any modification of the model interior or invasive degradation of\nthe model surface. The proposed stack arrangement of\nsensors can be bonded to most aerodynamic body surfaces including curved surfaces as known in the art and\ncan be removed after completion of the experiment.\nMany improvements, modifications and substitutions\nwill be apparent to the skilled artisan without departing\nfrom the spirit and scope of the present invention as\ndescribed in the present specification and defined in the\nfollowing claims.\nWhat is claimed is:\n1.
