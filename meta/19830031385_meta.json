The canopy is conceptualized with reflecting and transmitting leaf facets, with the leaf orientations described by a leaf slope distribution, thereby yielding scattering matrices for canopy layers. The model predictions, when compared with ground-truth measurements, show good agreement except at visible wavelengths, where overestimations are observed. Conditions under which the model satisfies the reciprocity theorem are defined. Extension of the model by including azimuth is indicated.", "title": "Reflectance of a vegetation canopy using the Adding method", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-11T15:01:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19830031385, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Cooper, K."}, "organization": {"name": "Colorado State Univ.", "location": "Fort Collins, CO, United States"}}, "id": "b9fcc26a76bd41fdbc61550af44e540d"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19830031385, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Smith, J.
