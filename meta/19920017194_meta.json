The areas covered were solar activity, solar wind, terrestrial effects, and solar acceleration. Specific topics addressed include: (1) solar cycle manifestations, both large and small scale, as well as long-term and short-term changes, including transients such as flares; (2) sources of solar wind, as identified by interplanetary observations including coronal mass ejections (CME's) or x-ray bright points, and the theory for and evolution of large-scale and small-scale structures; (3) magnetosphere responses, as observed by spacecraft, to variable solar wind and transient energetic particle emissions; and (4) origin and propagation of solar cosmic rays as related to solar activity and terrestrial effects, and solar wind coronal-hole relationships and dynamics.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "USSR", "submissionId": 19920017194, "endDate": "1990-10-20T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "Interacademy Workshop on Solar Terrestrial Physics", "id": "1359c697988b4100a8cd17a3d765589a", "startDate": "1990-10-15T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 19920017194, "id": "499ae0a8409d4283bfd57a79e1bfce19", "publicationDate": "1992-04-10T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19920017194.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19920017194/downloads/19920017194.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19920017194/downloads/19920017194.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19920017194/downloads/19920017194.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
