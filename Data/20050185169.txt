Filman NASA Ames Research Center filrnan@computer.org\n\nn \xe2\x80\x9cThe Green Isle in the Sea,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99 James Thurber\nrelates a Lemony Snicket-style series of unfortunate events that happened to an old gentleman one day, concluding with a moral amplifying\na theme from Robert Louis Stevenson: \xe2\x80\x9cThe world\nis so full of a number of things. I am sure we\nshould ail be as happy as kings, and you know\nhow happy kings are.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99\n\nI\n\nHow Happy Are Kings?\nOn Wednesday evening, 17 July 1717, King George\nI took his nobles out for an evening dinner cruise\non open barges, proceeding up the Thames to supit\nper at Chelsea. One barge held f f y musicians\nplaying George Frideric Handel\xe2\x80\x99s Water Music,\ncomposed especially for the occasion. The royal\nbash must have been a blast; the king liked the\nmusic so well he had it played three times, and the\nparty didn\xe2\x80\x99t make it back to St. James until after\nfour in the morning.\nSometimes it\xe2\x80\x99s good to be king. You can get\nHandel to compose symphonies for you and have\ncommand performances while you dine. On the\nother hand, I have it much better than George in\nmany ways. Although I can\xe2\x80\x99t summon fifty musicians to play Handel, I can choose to listen to works\nby Handel and a large variety of his successors\nnearly instantaneously, played by the best musicians in the world, who don\xe2\x80\x99t complain even when\nI demand five or six consecutive performances.\nChelsea was a big trip for George; but I\xe2\x80\x99ve flown\nthousands of miles in the time it took him to go\nthere and back My palace, while not as large as St.\nJames, is centrally heated and air conditioned. My\ndoctors also know more tricks than just how to\napply leeches. About the only thing George had better than the average IC reader was in the arena of\npersonal service - George had a retinue to do his\nbidding, whereas all I have is Google.\n\nWhat, Me Worry?\nGeorge worried about the Jacobite rebellion (and\n\n4\n\nJANUARY FEBRUARY 2005\n\nPublished by the IEEE Computer Society\n\nthe attempts to restore Catholicism to England),\nhow best to extract money from his position, and\nhis inability to get along with his son, the future\nGeorge 11. I worry about many things - among\nthem, the Internet.\nWhat makes the kingdom of the Internet special is its universal, bidirectional availability. That\nis, anyone can be a publisher, posting whatever\nthey like without someone else\xe2\x80\x99s approval; being\na consumer is even easier because search mechanisms such as Google and its friends simplify\nmatching up interested information producers,\nconsumers, and exchangers; and the entire mechanism is priced (at least for us twenty-first century kings) quite modestly.\nWhat forces threaten our kingdom? Vandals,\ngovernments and economics.\n\nVandals, Governments,\nand Economics\nThe Internet grew out of a scientific experiment\namong cooperating laboratories. As often\nremarked, this arrangement deemphasized security issues - the club\xe2\x80\x99s members could be expected\nto be well-behaved. Mechanisms such as really\nkeeping track of who was sending which packets\nand changing which routing tables weren\xe2\x80\x99t critical. Unfortunately, the low level of security appropriate for an academic research platform seems\ninadequate for a world-wide system for business,\ncommerce, and entertainment.\nThe imagination (and sometimes, lack of imagination) of those who abuse the system has been\nimpressive. We\xe2\x80\x99ve lost news to the hucksters and\nmight be headed the same way with email and\nspammers. The typical computer user\xe2\x80\x99s nalvete has\nmade the Internet prime ground for phishing and\nidentity theft. The increasing availability of wireless\nsolutions for various devices will likely soon lead to\nlaptop infections, caught solely through the devices\xe2\x80\x99\nproximity to other machines, and perhaps even cell\nphone viruses. The number of ways that remote\n\nio89-780i/o5/$20.00 0 200s IEEE\n\nIEEE INTERNET COMPUTING\n\nSection Header\n\nmechanisms can cause programs to\nexecute (and be embedded) on local\nmachines, and the uses that attackers\ncan put such drones to, are astounding.\nI try to avoid these problems by using\nolder technology (I don\xe2\x80\x99t think my cell\nphone is smart enough to support a\nvirus) and less-popular operating systems. But as Thurber also observed of\nthe fly who avoided the empty spider\xe2\x80\x99s\nweb but rushed to the crowded flypaper, \xe2\x80\x9cThere is no safety in numbers, or\nin anything else.\xe2\x80\x9d3\nIf the vandals don\xe2\x80\x99t do in :he Internet, various governments just might.\nThe purpose of government seems to\nbe to pass laws, and those who pass\nlaws are sure of the rightness of their\nopinions. We have European governments trying to outlaw selling Nazi\nparaphernalia, commonwealth governments asserting the primacy of\nEnglish-style libel laws, American\nstates asserting demands for commercial disclaimers and puritan Web site\ncontent, and totalitarian governments\n\nsubverting search engines to control\nwhat their populations can find out\nabout. All are certain that their rules\napply not only to people publishing\nthings within their jurisdictions but\nalso to people publishing things that\nmight be viewed within their realms that is, everybody.\nIf governments\xe2\x80\x99 moral principles\ndon\xe2\x80\x99t do in the Internet, their economic\nmeddling, or lack thereof, just might.\nEvery business would like to extract\nmonopoly profits; for many activities,\nsuch as Internet connectivity and\ntelecommunications, monopolies are\nnatural equilibrium points. Monopolies\nincrease one player\xe2\x80\x99s profits at a cost to\nsociety as a whole - hence, we have\nvarious rules and regulations governing\ncorporate behavior. It\xe2\x80\x99s easy for govemments to get this kind of thing wrong,\nparticularly because they\xe2\x80\x99re more susceptible to ideology and external influence than principled engineering.\nEconomics holds other threats to\nthe Internet. Just as it\xe2\x80\x99s not good for\n\n__\n\nan@cornputer org\n\none player to gamer monopoly profits,\nit\xe2\x80\x99s also not good for there to be no\nprofits. Our Internet must thus evolve\nto a point where service providers\n(whether telecommunication companies, engineers, or creative artists) get\nthe right amount of encouragement for\ntheir efforts. Globalization, winnertake-all conflicts, regulation, and\nderegulation all have the potential to\nso dirty the playing field that playing\nis no longer worthwhile.\n\no that\xe2\x80\x99s\nking\nSTherebutis how happybethisoptimisticI\nmuch to\nabout,\nhardly lack for worries.\n\nis.\n\nI\nsuspect you\xe2\x80\x99re like that too.\nReferences\n\n1 .
