The spacecraft uses solar electric propulsion (SEP) as its primary propulsion system during the ~3.5 year trajectory to (16) Psyche and 21 month orbital operations period around the asteroid. As the first NASA mission to use Hall thrusters for deep space exploration, unique challenges have been identified and resolved in how we plan to accommodate unplanned coast (missed thrust time) during the trajectory and orbital operations and still meet the mission objectives. This paper describes the projects missed thrust requirements in detail, along with the accompanying rationale and analysis plan for the Psyche mission.", "title": "Missed Thrust Requirements for Psyche Mission", "stiType": "PREPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20220001531, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Snyder, John Steven"}}, "id": "afe4fee2142441b19671e164559f5fdf"}, {"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20220001531, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Oh, David"}}, "id": "9308de94ac604ea1ad0a2d8fda2fb380"}, {"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20220001531, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Imken, Travis"}}, "id": "7fa48a13c9b04e069c0215be1930dee4"}, {"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20220001531, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Hart, William"}}, "id": "e302e07406d745f69ec31ad14672ecd3"}, {"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20220001531, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Madni, Ashley"}}, "id": "7ea050210fe14f528cc4f835b6687e11"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Preprint (Draft being sent to journal)", "technicalReviewType": "NOT_SET", "modified": "2022-09-30T05:51:01.6794670+00:00", "id": 20220001531, "sourceIdentifiers": [{"number": "2014/53240", "type": "HANDLE"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20220001531, "publisher": "Pasadena, CA: Jet Propulsion Laboratory, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, 2020", "id": "b00af0575e6b4496992baca4900992f6", "publicationDate": "2020-08-24T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
