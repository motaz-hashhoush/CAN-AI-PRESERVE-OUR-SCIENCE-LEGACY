These best practices were identified through a series of seminars and discussions held at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC). The best practices are arrived through many years of experience and improvements made in the operations procedures and the operational systems with the primary drivers as mission safety and cost effectiveness. This paper discusses the operational aspects associated with how different organizations manage complexities of constellation operations. For the purposes of this paper, satellite constellations are groups of similar spacecraft with more than one spacecraft needed to fully accomplish the constellation's mission", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "Italy", "submissionId": 20080039173, "endDate": "2006-06-23T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "Space Ops 2006", "location": "Rome", "id": "8ded71e94f4947fcb3433626f9becfc4", "startDate": "2006-06-19T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20080039173, "id": "90d159eb593140caa89c698992e49f95", "publicationDate": "2006-06-19T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20080039173.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20080039173/downloads/20080039173.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20080039173/downloads/20080039173.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20080039173/downloads/20080039173.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
