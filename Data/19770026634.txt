INTRODUCTION.\nThe Earth Resources C^Ffice hosted a Regional Transfer. Activity Contract\nReview on February 15-17, 1977.. In addition to being a legal contract review,\nan important additional purpose of the joint review was to enable contractors to\nsee what others were doing within their mutual objective o:f ransfer of advanced\ntechnology to solve regional problems. Such sharing of experiences would serve\nto avoid unnecessary duplications of successes and errors..\nThe program was conducted according to the poster session concept. In\nthis format, contractors were provided with bulletin-board space on which to\ndisplay various charts, graphs,. diagrams, maps, imagery, or text to illustrate \t\nmajor points o:f their presentations. The poster sessions provided a convenient\nmechanism for .informal discussions and comparisons of each contractor\'s\nresults with similar materials of other attendees. In addition to the contractorsT\npresentations, comme \xe2\x96\xbalts were offered by several visiting groups. involved in\nregional transfer activities.\n\ni ,\t\n\n;.\n`\n\nThin report contains sunnnaries of the contractors\' presentations. These\nsummaries were written by the authors of this report,. not by the contractors.\nThey are intended to give highlights of each activity as it existed in midI+ebrua-ry 1977.. Some contracts were at an intermediate phase; therefore, more\nresults would\'be expected later.\xe2\x80\xa2.

SUMMARIES OF PRESENTATIONS\n\nREMOTE SENSING APPLICATION TO REGIONAL\nACTIVITIES IN TENNESSEE \xe2\x80\x94 NAS8-31980\nUniversity of Tennessee Space Llstitute, Tullahoma, Tennessee - \t\nNancy Jonesand Leslie Sharber\n\n\'\n.,.,.\n\nThe objective of this activity was to demonstrate the feasibility of remote\nsensing applications to potential users with. specific problems which could possiUly be alleviated by such technological applications. Two users who identified\nspecific problems to tfie University of \'Tennessee Space Institute (UTSI) were\nthe U. S. Soil Conservation. Service. (SCS) in Tennessee and . the Tennessee\nState Planninb Office. (TSPO) .\nA study was made for SCS to demonstrate the application and utilization\nof Landsat imagery for determining land use of selected watershed. areas in\nwest Tennessee with special emphasis\'on determining wetland. boundaries.\nUTSI made a study for TSPO to determine the accuracy of Landsat imagery for\nmeasuring. strip mines of the size common in east Tennessee and to examine\nthe possibility of detecting and snapping strip mine subcategories.\n\n!^\t\n\nI\'or both of these problems sample areas were selected for detailed\na\nanalysis. Landsat imagery and supplementary aircraft photography of the\nrespective test areas were obtained and submitted to nitd.tilevel analysis using\nconventional photo interpretation methods,. densitometric l;erluiiques, mLtltispectral analysis,. and. statistical testing. As a esult of these. analyses, it was\ndetermined that Landsat data in imagery form col^ld be used effectively to\nprovide ixeeded resource information for management and preservationprograms\nby the .respective agencies.\n\na\n\nTIIE VERIFICATION OI\' LANDSAT DATA..

The research objective was to verify Landsat as\n2\n\n,:^\n\nk\t\n\n^^.\t\n\n^\t\n\n-\n\n..\t\n\n^\t\n\n^\t\n\n^\n\nd\n\nan accurate, efficient cartographic tool. that could be employed by a wide range\nof users to study wetland dynamics.\nThe verification procedure developed. for the project was based on the\nvisual interpretation and measurement of multispectral/multiscale imagery.\t\nThe accuracy testing procedure was predicated on surrogate ground truth data\ngleaned from medium altitude imagery of the wetlands. fourteen sites or case\nstudy areas were. selected from individual 9 x 9 in. photo frames ^o^i the aerial \t\nphotography. These bites were then used as data .control calibration parameters\nfor assessing the cartography accuracy of the Landsat imagery. \t\n\n,\n\n^\n^..\nl\n^\n\nAn analysis of results obtained from the verification tests indicated that \t\n1;250, 000 . scale Landsat data were the most reliable scale of imagery for visually\nmapping and measuring wetlands using the area grid technique. The mean areal\npercentage of accuracy was 93. 54 percent (real) and 96.93 percent (absolute)\nAs a test of accuracy, the Landsat 1:250, 000 scale overall. wetland measure- \t\n^nents were compared,with an area cell mensuration of the swamplands from\n1:130, 000 scale color infrared U-2 aircraft imagery. The comparative totals\nsubstantiated the results obtained from the Landsat verification procedure. It\nwas concluded from this study that Landsat data are an accurate medium for\nmapping, monitoring, and measuring wetlands, and could therefore. be employed\nby user-oriented agencies as a reliable and economically advantageous alternative to aerial-photography for wetlands data collection and management..\n\n1\n\ni\n_3\n\n^\n\nDEVELOPMENT OF ALABAMA RESOURCES INFORMATION\nSYSTEM - AIi,IS i \xe2\x80\x94 NAS8-30G54\n^\'\n\nAuburn University, Auburn, Alabama \xe2\x80\x94 R.

Four lal^es\nwere selected as test sites, all on the. same Landsat scene.\nFrom this study,. it appeared possible to differentiate the coastal plain\nlal^es into four broad groups. It was also possible to relate water quality parameters to reflectance characteristics within Lake Mattamuskeet. Nutrient measurements showed that Lake Mattamuskeet was more productive than Lake Phelps.\nEach of the two lakes had its own distinctive "mass character" which was sensed\nby Landsat. Thus, it appeared. that not all of the variables could be directly\ncorrelated to the imagery and that the "mass character" might be more important than anyspecific parameter in detecting water quality by satellite. Reflectances .recorded a balance among a large number of dependent variables.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\n.....\n\nCOMPUTI+;R PROCESSING OF PEACH TREE\nDECLINE DATA \xe2\x80\x94NAS8-31850\nGeorgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia \xe2\x80\x94Nick L.

For the three remaining. watersheds, \t\nthe new model yielded predictions oflesser accuracy, the worst being 2 to 1.\nReasonable explanations for the discrepancy are { 1) that the model was\noversimplified by not operatingit in its fully interconnected version . ,. and (2)\nthe three watersheds are considerably. more. complex than-the other six, and \t\nthey need, to be split into subwatersheds, predicting the output from these, then\nrouting all outputs through the.. watershed channels. \'This. technique is proposed\nfor future phases of the . effort.\n\n14\n\n-}:\n.\t\n\n_^_\t^\n\n,..\n\n^.:^.\n\n^^^\n\ni\n\ni\n\ni\n\n3\n\ni\n\'I\n\n\'\n\nI\n\nPLANNING FOR A CENTER FOR INFORMATION, EDUCATION,\nAND TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT IN REMOTE SENSINGNAS8-32218\nUniversity of Mississippi, University, Mississippi -- Donald E.

CONTRACT NAS8-31980\nUniversity of Tennessee Space Institute\nBACKGROUND\nBeginning in June 1971, the University of Tennessee Space Institute (UTSI):\nconducted several Earth resources research tasks under sponsorship of NASA.\nThese included a study of potential uses of satellite and aircraft remote sensing\nfor the southeastern U. S. (1971) , and study of new remote sensing techniques\n(1972-1973). The latter was under a University Affairs grant, NGR 43-001-115.\nBeginning in March 1972,.. UTSI has sponsored an . annual remote sensing symposium which has acquired international acclaim for excellence. UTSI now\noperates their own remote0. ensing airplane.\n\n..,.\n\nIn summary, UTSI has established a unique capability for remote sensing. of\nEarth resources in the southeastern U. S.\nWORK STATEMENT\nThe objective of the contract will be to establish joint activity with NASA: and one\nor more selected state government agencies, so that a transfer of aerospace\ntechnology to state use will be encouraged. This . will be accomplished by consultation with state agency personnel to define problems,. by design of remote\n..sensing experiments to attempt solutions,. and by demonstration of the feasibility\nof technological applications to the potential: users) .

Kentucky is a valuable watershed\nto centraLand eastern Kentucky as well as to adjoining states. `The climax.\nvegetation over most of this region is the mixed. mesophytic .forest which. proodes excellent protection. to the. easily erodable soils \xc2\xb0^.nder the intense percipitation which is characteristic of the area. However, . when the native vegetation\nis disturbed by man f s actions or natural catastrophes, the soils erode rapidly.\nand the clear mountain streams become heavily laden with silt and chemical\npollutants. The area is isolated, of steep terrain, aild thinly populated. PromiWent land uses are hillside farming, forest harvesting, and surface mining.\nl^lthough hillside farms and timber harvesting activities :have decreased since\nthe\' urn of the century, surface-mining. activites,have increased in the past 15\nyea:: s, and thousands of acres of land are being denuded and exposed to accel-\t\nerate^d erosion annually. Currently about 20, 000 acres of land is being mned,by\nthis method in Kentucky each year. .Since only about 10 percent of the total land\nsuitablefor surface. miningfor coal has been mined and an energyshortage. is\npredicted for this country, this trend can be expected to increase for some time\t\nin the future. Despite efforts to recl^:im this land,.. particularly through the\nenactment in Kentucl^y of` the 19GG Surface Mining . Law, .results are discouraging.\t\n..;Sediment frond the bare, .steep outslopes continue to be deposited. into the once\nclear streams of eastern`Kentixcky. hi addition, it appears that tmber\'harvesting \t\nactivities will increase again in this area in the future, although not to be tempo\nof the early 1900 1 s.\nIf the watersheds of this region are to be managed for quality water, then. some\n.method must be devised for identifying the nature and extent\' of various land uses,\nassessing their effect on water quality, and monitoring these activities on a\n\ni\t\n\n53\n\n\'\n\n^\n\'^\nj\n\n^^ 4^\n\n_^\n\np eriodic basis. Remote sensing appears to offer some possibilities in providing\neffec^ive survey monitoring techniques at a reasonable cost, but specific capabilities of different types of remote sensi\xe2\x96\xbaig must be worked out to solve the\nlocal problems. The capabilities and limitations of each sensor or technique\nmust be demonstrated to interested agencies so that they can take advantage of\nthese techniques in day to day problem solving.\nLand-use planning at the state level . is expected to be an area of emphasis in the\nhear future. For the Commonwealth of Kentucky, the Department for Natural\n\t\nResources .and Environmental Protection will seek cost-effective means for\nland-use survey. Again, remote sensing may prove to be the answer.\n\n.^...\n\nWORK STATEMENT\nThe objective. of the contract will be to explore remote sensing techniques and\ndetermine their utility and cost-effectivity in determination of the effects of landuse practices on water quality in Kentucky.

Bay varies significantly in all three spacial dimensions\nand with time.. Tl1is flow is controlled by river flow into the bay s s periphery,\nley tide activity in the adjacent Gulf, by winds and rains over the bay, and by\nthe geometry of the bottom. The flowing fluid consists primarily of water,\nsalt, and suspended sediments.\n\n\'^ \'\t\n\nThe objective of this research is restricted. to the investigation of the effects.\n.caused by vertical variations of velu^ity, salinity, and sediment concentration.\nIn the first phase of the study,. a mathematical model was developed wlii_cli\ndescribes the velocit and salinit .^\'\t fields In the second p ^\t e of this s\t\ny\nh^\ntud y,\nY\t\n(i:. e. , in the second . year effort) the sediment conservation .and deposition mates\nwill be predicted uy using the . flow-field program from the first phase and doing\n-\t\nthe suUsequent cillculation to describe the sediment. \t\n\n!-^\n\na\n\ni\n\nThe status. of . the first effort is the development of tidal-bay model for Mobile \t\nBay..

Flooding of the highways and businesses on the low lands of the \t\nbay f s northern boundary due to high tides and winds is a frequent occurrence.\n\n\xc2\xab...\n\nThe bay contains a ship channel which is dredged and maintained by the Corps\nof Engineers.

The prediction. of peal: runoff, especially in engaged watersheds, is of\nsignificant importance to users for the purpose of planning, sizing, and. designing\nwaterworlcs.\n2. To predict peak events with adequate accuracy,. conventional models\nmust be augmented by reflecting. a deeper unclerstandiilg of the phenomena\ninvolved.\n3. The depth of these fornnil.ations need not be carried to the ultimate,.\nbut must be sufficient to the end sought (. e. , to the accuracy desired) .\n4. Of the many phenomena and relationships underlying the behavior of\nhydrologic quantities, only a few are dominant for planning models; others can\nbe neglected, or, in the extreme,. factored in as constant corrections.\n5. The crucial phetloiuena reglil.ating peak events are, to a significant\neltent, surface.-dependent and thus Highly ai2ienable to remote sensing.\nG. ror the cases where subsurface phenomena . playa :significant role,\npeak .events can still be predicted through a combination of remotely .sensed\nobservables and available subsurface.. para^izeters.\n\n` \'\t\n\nr.
