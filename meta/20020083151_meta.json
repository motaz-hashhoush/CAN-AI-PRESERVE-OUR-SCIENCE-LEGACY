It was originally developed for NASA by Arthur D. Little, and is sold commercially by EXOS, Inc. The DHM is worn on the hand and connected to a computer that records hand motions. The resulting data is transmitted as control signals to robots and other computers, enabling robotic hands to emulate human hand actions. Two additional spinoff products were also inspired by the DHM.", "title": "Small Business Innovations (Exoskeletons)", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-20T23:12:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-09-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20020083151, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20020083151, "isbn": "0-16-038211-4", "id": "d56d0e6626904471856ac56c8845eead", "publicationName": "Spinoff 1992", "publicationDate": "1992-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20020083151.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20020083151/downloads/20020083151.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20020083151/downloads/20020083151.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20020083151/downloads/20020083151.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
