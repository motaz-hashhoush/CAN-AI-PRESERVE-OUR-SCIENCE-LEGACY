Among them are genetic modification and a genetic switch. They originated in research for Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Extensive experiments in cell growth through production of hemoglobin to improve oxygen supply to cells were performed. By improving efficiency of oxygen use by cells, major operational expenses can be reduced. Greater product yields result in decreased raw material costs and more efficient use of equipment. A broad range of applications is cited.", "title": "Cell Growth Enhancement", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-20T23:12:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-09-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20020083163, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20020083163, "isbn": "0-16-038211-4", "id": "b8ce3a03d4314457b7369e5de7a4db6b", "publicationName": "Spinoff 1992", "publicationDate": "1992-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20020083163.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20020083163/downloads/20020083163.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20020083163/downloads/20020083163.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20020083163/downloads/20020083163.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
