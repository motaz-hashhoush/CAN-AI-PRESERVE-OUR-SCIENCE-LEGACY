Operable on land or water, the Amphib One is equipped with 3 water cannons. When all 3 are operating, unit pumps more than 3,000 gallons a minute. Newly developed model used by U.S. Coast Guard can pump 5,000 gallons per minute. It was designed for applications such as firefighting onboard ship fires, emergency dockside water pumping, dewatering ships in danger of sinking, flood control, and emergency water supply at remote locations.", "title": "Firefighting Module", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-20T22:17:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-09-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20020091924, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20020091924, "id": "e32ed7a725a44ee89b71429106cc024c", "publicationName": "Spinoff 1984", "publicationDate": "1984-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20020091924.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20020091924/downloads/20020091924.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20020091924/downloads/20020091924.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20020091924/downloads/20020091924.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
