Teachers selected for the project participate\nin a two-week\nsummer workshop\nconducted\nat the University\nof Maryland,\nCollege Park;\ndevelop classroom-ready\nmaterials during the workshop\nfor broad dissemination;\nconduct a\nminimum\nof two peer training activities during the coming school year; and participate\nin\nother enrichment/education\nopportunities\nas available and desired.\nDiscover Earth is a team\neffort that utilizes expertise\nfrom a range of contributors,\nand balances science content with\nhands-on\nclassroom\napplications.\nPlanning\nTo ensure that Discover Earth plans for the summer workshop\nwere effective\nand\nappropriately\nfocused, the project conducted\na one-day Definition\nWorkshop\nat the\nUniversity\nof Maryland,\nCollege Park, on February\n21, 1997. Participants\nincluded the\nDiscover Earth team (Ms. Colleen Steele, Project Manager, IGES; Dr. Eric Barron,\nDirector, Earth System Science Center, The Pennsylvania\nState University;\nDr. Robert\nHudson, Chairman,\nDepartment\nof Meteorology,\nUniversity\nof Maryland,\nCollege Park;\nand Ms. Claudia Dauksys,\nAdministrative\nSupport, IGES); one classroom\nteacher who\nparticipated\nin the 1996 workshop;\nfive classroom\nteachers with a range of expertise\nsuch\nas serving as a NASA Teacher on Loan or science department\nchair; and one NASA\nrepresentative\nand two University\nof Maryland faculty members who would be presenting\nat the workshop.\nThis session was used to review the workshop\ngoals and the draft\ncourse outline developed\nby Ms. Steele, review the workshop\nassessment\ncompleted\nby the\nprevious summer\'s\nparticipants,\nconsider ways to enhance the application\nof the science\ncontent in the classroom,\nand enhance relevance\nto National Science Education\nStandards.\nApplication\n\n_, .:;\n\nand\n\nSelection\n\nProcess\n\nThe Discover Earth project announcement\nand application\nare disseminated\nelectronically\n(NASA Spacelink,\nGoddard\nSpace Flight Center homepage,\nEarth System Science\nEducation\nNotes, EarthRise\nhomepage,\nand via e-mail) and in hard copy (approximately\nfour thousand copies of the announcement\nbrochure were distributed\nvia science teacher\norganizations\nand state education\nheirarchies).\nThe workshop\nannouncement\n(attachment\nA) and application\n(attachment\nB) are intended to entice teachers with a range of experience,\nexpertise,\nand time in profession.\nIn order to address the full spectrum of teacher needs,\ncomputer\nskills are not a selection criteria.\nFifteen teachers were selected for participation\nin the 1997 workshop,\nhighlights\nof their interests and accomplishments\nare listed in\nattachment\nC. Two additional\nparticipants,\nboth NASA Aerospace\nEducation\nSpecialists\n(NAES), were selected by that program to participate,\nat the invitation of the Discover Earth\nproject.\nThe list of workshop\nparticipants\nis attachment\nD.\n\nSummer\n\nWorkshop\n\nThe Discover\nEarth summer workshops\n(1996-1998)\nfocus on science content (the seven\nkey issues of global climate change) and enhancing\nEarth system science teaching (through\nnew resources,\ndevelopment\nof classroom-ready\nmaterials,\nsharing of peer ideas and\nstrategies,\nand introducing\nrelevant technology/software).\nContent emphasis\nfor 1997 was\non:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\nThe\n\nan overview\nof the Earth system;\nland surface; ecosystems\nand hydrology\nvolcanoes\nand climate change\nsources of information;\nand\nstudent investigations/classroom\nactivities.\nworkshop\nagenda is attachment\nE.\n\nScience content instructors\nwere Dr. Eric Barron (Penn State), Dr. Soroosh Sorooshian\n(U. of Arizona),\nDr. Alan Robock (U of MD-CP),\nand Dr. Satya Kalluri (U of MD-CP).\nDr. Robert Hudson served as academic host and scientific and technical\nresource.\nMs. Colleen Steele guided classroom\napplications\nand development\nof educational\nmaterials.\nMs. Stephanie\nStockman presented\nan overview\nof Mission to Planet Earth\nrelevant NASA Internet sites.\n\nand\n\nParticipants\nreceived project and logistic information\nprior to the workshop.\nLogistics\nsupport included hotel accommodations,\nbreakfast and lunch, per diem money for dinner\nexpenses,\ntravel cost, all materials for the course, and $500 honorarium\nupon successful\ncompletion.\nCourse materials were provide by Discover Earth for the NAES, but the\nbalance of their expenses\nwas paid for by that project.\nProject administration\nwas\nconducted\nby Ms. Colleen Steele, IGES, with logistical\nsupport provided\nby\nMs. Claudia\nDauksys,\nIGES.\nWorkshop\nparticipants\nwere divided (by the grade levels they teach) into five groups to\ndevelop classroom-ready\nmaterials.\nThe lessons were then edited by Ms. Steele to ensure\nthey were complete,\nunderstandable,\ncontained\nadequate background\ninformation,\nand were\nsupplemented\nwith graphic materials as appropriate.\nAll the lessons include Internet\noptions but do not require them for utilization. The materials developed\nduring the 1997\nworkshop\nhave been prepared for distribution\nand are currently\nbeing reviewed by the\nteachers.\nWhen the teachers finalize the materials at the end of this month, the materials\nwill be disseminated\nto participants\nand requesters\n(we have compiled\n& updated a database\nsince project inception),\nand will be available via Intemet (including\nNASA Spacelink,\nEarthRise,\nGSFC homepage,\netc.)\nClassroom\nmaterials developed by the participants\ninclude background\ninformation\nand are\naccompanied\nby NASA Facts, when appropriate,\nto familiarize\nteachers with key issues of\nclimate change and enable them to introduce these topics in their classrooms.\nThe\nclassroom\nmaterials\ndeveloped\nduring the 1996 workshop\nare enclosed\n(attachment\nF).\n\nAssessment\nParticipants\ncompleted\na content assessment\ntest on the first day of the course to identify\ntheir levels of knowledge,\nwhich guided the instructors\nin utilizing the available time.\nParticipants\ncompleted\na course evaluation\nat the end of day nine (the summary\nof their\nresponses\nis attachment\nG).
