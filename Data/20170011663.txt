Evaluate, leverage, and integrate emerging sensor technologies and intelligent\nsystems to enhance biofeedback and overall human health. Develop and retain team\nmembers, collaborators, customers, and end users who are valuable, loyal and enthusiastic.\n\nMiniature Exercise Device (MED)\nOur team has a long history of developing, certifying, and\nsustaining the exercise system that has been critical to\nthe success of human spaceflight missions and health\nof the crewmembers, including the following\nInternational Space Station (ISS) equipment.\n\xe2\x97\x8f\n\xe2\x97\x8f\n\xe2\x97\x8f\n\xe2\x97\x8f\n\nResistive exercise (ARED)\nTreadmill (TVIS, T2)\nRecumbent bike (CEVIS)\nHealth monitoring (HRM, BP/ECG)\n\nHowever, to enable exploration missions beyond Low-Earth\nOrbit, the exercise system is being completely reconceived\nto have a significantly reduced mass and volume while\nimproving effectiveness.\nThe MED is a portable 65-pound device that has been\ndeveloped with these objectives in mind and is currently\nbeing evaluated on ISS. This single device integrates\nresistive exercise, aerobic rowing, and potentially\nbicycling. It will be a next-generational leap beyond what\nis currently found in fitness centers and training facilities.\nUnlike traditional exercise capabilities, the loading profile\nprovided by the MED is programmable and currently includes\nconstant loading, inertial loading and eccentric overloading.\nThe next step is to develop loading profile flexibility that\nallows user-specific tailored dynamic variation within a single\nrepetition that could further enhance strength training and\nrehabilitation effectiveness.\nThe subsequent goal is to enable the device to intelligently use sensor data to automatically tailor an\nindividual\xe2\x80\x99s loading profile. Our OnePortal Graphical User Interface (GUI) enables prescriptions,\nreal-time adjustments, sensor display to the crew, and data collection at 100 Hz.\n\nExercise Technology Development\nThrough projects like MED and the future PHNX (Physiology-based Human-machine Nextgen eXercise) system, JSC\n(ER3) is developing the next vision of biofeedback integration in exercise:\n\xe2\x97\x8f Improving reliability and modularity to logistics and maintenance means more time training with less overhead.\n\xe2\x97\x8f Providing intuitive operational interfaces that humanize data allowing the athlete/operator\nand the system to make real time training decisions that promote changes to psychological\narchitecture and enhance physiological adaptations.\n\xe2\x97\x8f Integrating multiple exercise modalities, including difficult to train accessory elements (e.g.\nsensorimotor, monitoring), yield a more explorative training environment not limited to single\nplane movement or the confines of a gym space.\n\xe2\x97\x8f Integrating augmentation, rehabilitation, etc. into the system framework to track changes to\ntissue loading, posture, movement patterns, etc. to help recover from injury or act as a\nproactive filter for future insults to physiology.\n\xe2\x97\x8f Collecting and adjusting exercise prescriptions based on sensor data to create a fully,\nbiofeedback oriented system making live modifications to motor loading/controls based on\ncurrent and intended states of the athlete/operator. A smart system that takes in the data\nfrom the other 20+ hours you are not training and fuses it with the time under strain.\n\nNext Generation Crew Exercise Software\nData should not be a burden to a user; it should be provocative, detailed, and\neasily accessible. We have collaborated with multiple research groups\ndeveloping a cross-platform architecture via OnePortal; an integrated exercise\nsoftware, providing ease of use, improved data collection, and virtual training\nassistance that:\n\xe2\x97\x8f Allows computer-controlled exercise devices to be tailored to a variety of\nloading profiles that include not only known effective modalities like\neccentric overloading, but also produce profiles that cannot exist in the gym.\n\xe2\x97\x8f Utilizes Bluetooth technology for sensor connection, response, command, and control of\nbiometric data so that current and future wearable technologies will always be supported.\n\xe2\x97\x8f Will include a virtual training assistant using real time motion capture technology that maps\nmajor body points and provides active coaching, follow-up critique, and pattern identification\nuseful in injury prediction or rehabilitation.\n\xe2\x97\x8f Supports exercise socialization technology to instruct, motivate, and immerse the user via\nvirtual/augmented reality.\n\nThe Future of Exercise\nTaking the next step in developing crew exercise equipment is not only about the six humans in space today, but it is\nabout the success of future exploration and the seven billion people here on Earth. To have the largest impact,\nthinking one step forward is not appropriate methodology\xe2\x80\xa6 we need to think a large leap into the future:\n\xe2\x97\x8f Fully integrated exo-suit development technologies would allow for a human to train unique loading and\nconditioning profiles currently unavailable in multi-directional training and real-world exposure environments.\n\xe2\x97\x8f Development of deep neural network, intelligent learning algorithms to define the relationships of human\nphysiology on a level that supersedes the boundaries of individual discipline expertise; being able\nto analyze, predict, and proactively provide for users to maximize health and human performance\n\xe2\x97\x8f Integrating an active vibration and isolation system (that minimizes load transfer) into\n\nvirtual/augmented realities to enhance psychological, memory/learning, & experiential\ntraining to supplement physically-biased workout paradigms.\nFor More Information\n\nPoint of Contact\n\nhttp://er.jsc.nasa.gov/ER3/\n\nPhillip Callen \xe2\x97\x8f (281) 483-8087 \xe2\x97\x8f phillip.s.callen@nasa.gov\nJSC Engineering Directorate \xe2\x97\x8f Software Robotics & Simulation Division \xe2\x97\x8f Flight Systems Branch Chief\n\n'
