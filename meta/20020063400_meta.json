With support from the SBIR program, Mainstream Engineering Corporation has developed a unique low cost additive, QwikBoost (TM), that increases the performance of air conditioners, heat pumps, refrigerators, and freezers. Because of the energy and environmental benefits of QwikBoost, Mainstream received the Tibbetts Award at a White House Ceremony on October 16, 1997. QwikBoost was introduced at the 1998 International Air Conditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration Exposition. QwikBoost is packaged in a handy 3-ounce can (pressurized with R-134a) and will be available for automotive air conditioning systems in summer 1998.", "title": "Performance Boosting Additive", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-07T12:47:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-27T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20020063400, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20020063400, "isbn": "0-16-050159-8", "id": "929e3c0b4b9e407a9b41a54e88bfa472", "publicationName": "Spinoff 1999", "publicationDate": "1999-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20020063400.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20020063400/downloads/20020063400.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20020063400/downloads/20020063400.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20020063400/downloads/20020063400.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
