It will provide NOAA with an independent, mass communication system for the purpose of warning the public of impending disaster and issuing bulletins for corrective action to protect lives and property. The system consists of three major segments. The first segment is the network of state or regional offices that communicate with the central ground station; the second segment is the satellite that relays information from ground stations to home receivers; the third segment is composed of the home receivers that receive information from the satellite and provide an audio output to the public. The ground stations required in this system are linked together by two, separate, voice bandwidth communication channels on the Disaster Warning Satellites so that a communications link would be available in the event of disruption of land line service.", "title": "Disaster warning satellite study", "stiType": "TECHNICAL_MEMORANDUM", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-02T16:10:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Technical Memorandum (TM)", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19720021229, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19720021229, "id": "060bc6d380164fe1b4a6d0b5959c8379", "publicationDate": "1971-03-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19720021229.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19720021229/downloads/19720021229.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19720021229/downloads/19720021229.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19720021229/downloads/19720021229.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
