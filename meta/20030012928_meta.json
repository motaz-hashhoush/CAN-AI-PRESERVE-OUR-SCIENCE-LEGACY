Navier-Stokes simulations are conducted using the NASA Langley developed TetrUSS simulation suite which is based on tetrahedral, unstructured grids. The physics of the AWS phenomenon is understood by comparing CFD simulation results on two aircraft; a pre-production F/A-18E configuration which exhibits AWS phenomenon under certain geometric and flow conditions, and an F-16C aircraft configuration that does not. The CFD code is first validated against two sets of experimental data to build confidence in its use for the problem of AWS. An attempt is then made to understand the possible causes of AWS by analyzing and comparing the detailed flow fields between the two configurations under a variety of flow conditions. Based on this approach, a number of static Figures of Merit are developed to predict the potential existence of AWS. The FOMs include the break in the lift and wing root bending moment versus angle-of-attack (AoA) curves and the rate of change of sectional lift with respect to AoA. A companion paper, in Part II, describes a similar CFD study on two other aircraft, the AV-8B Harrier and F/A-18C. Results from both these studies, as well as other CFD studies conducted as part of the AWS program are used to recommend a CFD procedure for predicting the existence of AWS in future aerospace designs.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20030012928, "endDate": "2003-01-09T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "41st Aerospace Sciences Meeting and Exhibit", "location": "Reno, NV", "id": "4a1ea120c3b4406badd04d3e2ecd951d", "startDate": "2003-01-06T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20030012928, "id": "5b981b29944d408596983e29255c5561", "publicationDate": "2003-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20030012928.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20030012928/downloads/20030012928.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20030012928/downloads/20030012928.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20030012928/downloads/20030012928.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
