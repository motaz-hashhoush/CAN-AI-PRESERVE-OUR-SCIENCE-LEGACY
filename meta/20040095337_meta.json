Unlike previous methods for image evaluation, which typically assess the value of each image based on the presence of predetermined specific features, this method involves using two levels of machine-learning classifiers: one level is used to classify each pixel as belonging to one of a group of rather generic classes, and another level is used to rank the images based on these pixel classifications, given some example rankings from a scientist as a guide. Initial results indicate that the technique works well, producing new rankings that match the scientist's rankings significantly better than would be expected by chance. The method is demonstrated for a set of images collected by a Mars field-test rover.", "title": "Using Trained Pixel Classifiers to Select Images of Interest", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-07T11:44:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20040095337, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Mazzoni, D."}, "organization": {"name": "Jet Propulsion Lab., California Inst. of Tech.", "location": "Pasadena, CA, United States"}}, "id": "e8d7921fe7754069bb600ee1406b7f20"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 20040095337, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Wagstaff, K."}, "organization": {"name": "Jet Propulsion Lab., California Inst. of Tech.", "location": "Pasadena, CA, United States"}}, "id": "76457a4dd2684d4b982f8e70af034c93"}, {"sequence": 2, "submissionId": 20040095337, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Castano, R."}, "organization": {"name": "Jet Propulsion Lab., California Inst. of Tech.", "location": "Pasadena, CA, United States"}}, "id": "61ed4989c9f24f1ebba64ce08930162b"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20040095337, "publications": [{"volume": "42-158", "submissionId": 20040095337, "id": "b422e6a7119c41d88c3419a3b14ba76f", "publicationName": "Interplanetary Network Progress Report", "publicationDate": "2004-08-15T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20040095337.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20040095337/downloads/20040095337.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20040095337/downloads/20040095337.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20040095337/downloads/20040095337.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
