In this paper, key propulsion technologies to meet future needs are identified and the associated challenges are briefly discussed. Also discussed are NASA's vision, NASA's changing role in meeting today's challenge of a shrinking research budget, and propulsion technology impacts on the environment and air transport economics. Critical aeropropulsion technology drivers are identified and their impact evaluated. The aviation industry is critical to the nation's economy, job creation, and national security. NASA's advanced aeropropulsion technology programs and their relation to the aviation industry are discussed.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "Australia", "submissionId": 19960003336, "endDate": "1995-09-15T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "ISABE"}}, "meetingId": "14679f1acf2847b8804096babc142bfb", "id": "32d4b526754c479b9078e827f6b59b47"}], "name": "ISABE Conference", "location": "Melbourne", "id": "14679f1acf2847b8804096babc142bfb", "startDate": "1995-09-10T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 19960003336, "id": "24b9f924bd0b45f6b683cccb72bb24aa", "publicationDate": "1995-09-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19960003336.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19960003336/downloads/19960003336.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19960003336/downloads/19960003336.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19960003336/downloads/19960003336.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
