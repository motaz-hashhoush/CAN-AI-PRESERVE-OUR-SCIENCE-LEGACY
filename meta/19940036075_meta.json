The solar nebula theory and the planetesimal hypothesis are discussed. The latter is found to provide a viable theory of the growth of the terrestrial planets, the cores of the giant planets, and the smaller bodies present in the solar system. The formation of solid bodies of planetary size should be a common event, at least around young stars which do not have binary companions orbiting at planetary distances. Stochastic impacts of large bodies provide sufficient angular momentum to produce the obliquities of the planets. The masses and bulk compositions of the planets can be understood in a gross sense as resulting from planetary growth within a disk whose temperature and surface density decreased with distance from the growing sun.", "title": "Planet formation", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PROCEEDINGS", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-16T14:18:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19940036075, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Lissauer, Jack J."}, "organization": {"name": "New York State Univ.", "location": "Stony Brook; California Univ., Santa Barbara, United States"}}, "id": "c5ca7a1052304d969fea183c331816ae"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Proceedings", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-19T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19940036075, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19940036075, "publisher": "Annual Reviews, Inc.", "id": "8be6614c988244e6a7700d0405ef7003", "publicationName": "In: Annual review of astronomy and astrophysics.
