Reanalysis data were first compared to observations from weather stations located on wheat areas of the United States and Ukraine, and then evaluated in the context of a winter wheat yield forecast model. Results from the comparison with weather station data showed that all datasets performed well (r2>0.95) and that more modern reanalysis such as ERAI had lower errors (RMSD ~ 0.9) than the older, lower resolution datasets like NCEP1 (RMSD ~ 2.4). We also analyze the impact of using surface air temperature data from different reanalysis products on the estimations made by a winter wheat yield forecast model. The forecast model uses information of the accumulated Growing Degree Day (GDD) during the growing season to estimate the peak NDVI signal. When the temperature data from the different reanalysis projects were used in the yield model to compute the accumulated GDD and forecast the winter wheat yield, the results showed smaller variations between obtained values, with differences in yield forecast error of around 2% in the most extreme case. These results suggest that the impact of temperature discrepancies between datasets in the yield forecast model get diminished as the values are accumulated through the growing season.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "Spain", "submissionId": 20190002032, "endDate": "2018-07-27T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers", "location": "New York, NY, United States"}}, "meetingId": "929a2c59150a4fb9a3e9e94f62896171", "id": "70c8b3b316cc490bb46f398bfb5e1942"}], "name": "IGARSS 2018", "location": "Valencia", "id": "929a2c59150a4fb9a3e9e94f62896171", "startDate": "2018-07-22T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20190002032, "id": "90ef9871f23549d5840cb1e41c0e3b74", "publicationDate": "2018-07-22T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20190002032.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20190002032/downloads/20190002032.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20190002032/downloads/20190002032.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20190002032/downloads/20190002032.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
