Despite this boom in bandwidth, however, users at the end nodes were still not being reached on a consistent basis. (An end node is any device that does not behave like a router or a managed hub or switch. Examples of end node objects are computers, printers, serial interface processor phones, and unmanaged hubs and switches.) The primary reason that prevents bandwidth from reaching the end nodes is the complex local network topology that exists between the optical backbone and the end nodes. This complex network topology consists of several layers of routing and switch equipment which introduce potential congestion points and network latency. By breaking down the complex network topology, a true optical connection can be achieved. Access Optical Networks, Inc., is making this connection a reality with guidance from NASA s nondestructive evaluation experts.", "title": "Going End to End to Deliver High-Speed Data", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-07T10:56:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-27T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20060022043, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20060022043, "id": "60b18893ec704b51aa4b21bf18ad1c86", "publicationName": "Spinoff 2005", "publicationDate": "2005-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20060022043.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20060022043/downloads/20060022043.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20060022043/downloads/20060022043.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20060022043/downloads/20060022043.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
