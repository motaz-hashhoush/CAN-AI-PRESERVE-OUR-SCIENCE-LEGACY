Already, in the first few years of the Space Age, man has been able to penetrate the layer of atmosphere which surrounds his planet and to venture briefly into space. Scores of man-made objects have been thrust into space, some of them to roam the solar system forever. Behind each space mission are years of patient research, thousands of man-hours of labor, and large sums of money. Because the sums involved are so enormous, the question is frequently asked, \"Is it worth it?\" Many people want to know what return this huge investment will bring to mankind. The return on the investment is knowledge. The accumulation of knowledge over the centuries has made possible our advanced way of life. As we unlock more and more of the secrets of the universe through space exploration, we add new volumes to the encyclopedia of man's knowledge. This will be applied to the benefit of mankind. For the practical-minded, there are concrete benefits to our way of life. Although we are still in the Stone Age of space exploration, a number of immediate applications of space technology are already apparent. For instance, imagine the benefits of an absolutely perfect system of predicting the weather. Or, going a step further, even changing the weather. And wouldn't it be fascinating to watch the next Olympic games, telecast from Tokyo, on your TV set? These are just a few of the practical benefits made possible by space technology.", "title": "Spacecraft", "stiType": "BOOK", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2015-09-30T16:59:19.8700000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20150018537, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Clark, John F."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Headquarters", "location": "Washington, DC United States"}}, "id": "176b493e12d8497d97382af036c9eeba"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 20150018537, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Haggerty, James J."}, "organization": {"name": "Aerospace Year Book", "location": "Washington, DC"}}, "id": "f221cd529ec64c4e85766e5153b0f34b"}, {"sequence": 2, "submissionId": 20150018537, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Woodburn, John H."}, "organization": {"name": "Walter Johnson High School", "location": "Rockville, MD"}}, "id": "876be86cdbd84c05a5691ea329b6d4b7"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Book", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "id": 20150018537, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20150018537, "publisher": "Scholastic Book Services", "id": "b07771f175b942c483060e369749c39c", "publicationDate": "1961-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20150018537.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20150018537/downloads/20150018537.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20150018537/downloads/20150018537.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20150018537/downloads/20150018537.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
