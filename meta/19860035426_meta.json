Empirical and analytical methods for predicting airfoil performance degradation due to ice are discussed. Ice simulation techniques for aerodynamic testing are presented and compared to data with actual ice accretions. The results show that simulation techniques to imitate the effect of ice on airfoil performance work well in most cases. Comparisons between predicted and measured airfoil performance with ice accretions are presented. For rime ice cases, the predictions compared well with experiments; but for glaze ice, a need for improved methods are seen.", "title": "Airfoil aerodynamics in icing conditions", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-12T19:15:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19860035426, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Bragg, M.
