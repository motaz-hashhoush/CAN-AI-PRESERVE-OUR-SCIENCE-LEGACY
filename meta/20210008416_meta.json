The mission operations assurance discipline grew out of strategies to control error and evolved into what today is an independent technical authority dedicated to achieving mission success. After the Mars Climate Orbiter loss, NASA made a set of recommendations for missions. Two of those recommendations led to the creation of today\u2019s Mission Operations Assurance Manager role: (1) require an independent Mission Assurance representative during the operational phase of every flight project, and (2) require all flight projects to report and track post-launch anomalies. Since then, the MOAM role has been continually refined by lessons learned from its practice on more than 20 concurrent missions. The MOAM role requires significant operations experience as well as an additional set of skills. In the interests of developing a cadre of potential MOAMs, the MOAM training program was developed. It is a 14-unit set of presentations/discussions covering the 11 categories of MOAM tasks.  It is offered to new MOAMs and interested systems engineers with an eye to preparing both types of personnel for present and future assignments, as well as building relationships among personnel of different organizations. MOAM training sessions include presentations on the various tools and processes employed by MOAMs, interspersed with mindset lessons illustrated via \u201cwar story\u201d discussions of previous missions.", "title": "Preparing to Assure Mission Success", "stiType": "PREPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20210008416, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Bryant, Larry"}}, "id": "4c7b4116aacf4f8ab97fcc3dcd1d48f7"}, {"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20210008416, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Waggoner, Bruce C."}}, "id": "d937649772d64ef4a7e73056268f421f"}, {"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20210008416, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Faris, Grant B."}}, "id": "e28a69cce61342feab75f5ea3c23fae6"}, {"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20210008416, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Lock, Patricia D."}}, "id": "e71fb389eb5d4cce963ada8444e47438"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Preprint (Draft being sent to journal)", "technicalReviewType": "NOT_SET", "modified": "2022-09-30T05:20:55.4142210+00:00", "id": 20210008416, "sourceIdentifiers": [{"number": "2014/48225", "type": "HANDLE"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20210008416, "publisher": "Pasadena, CA: Jet Propulsion Laboratory, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, 2018", "id": "9ada683ed03e41519874ea5adaaed8e0", "publicationDate": "2018-05-28T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
