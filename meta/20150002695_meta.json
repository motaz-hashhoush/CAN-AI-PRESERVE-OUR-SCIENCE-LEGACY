Since Fall 2010, The SPHERES system is now operationally supported and managed by NASA Ames Research Center (ARC). A SPHERES Program Office was established and is located at NASA Ames Research Center. The SPHERES Program Office coordinates all SPHERES related research and STEM activities on-board the International Space Station (ISS), as well as, current and future payload development. By working aboard ISS under crew supervision, it provides a risk tolerant Test-bed Environment for Distributed Satellite Free-flying Control Algorithms. If anything goes wrong, reset and try again! NASA has made the capability available to other U.S. government agencies, schools, commercial companies and students to expand the pool of ideas for how to test and use these bowling ball-sized droids. For many of the researchers, SPHERES offers the only opportunity to do affordable on-orbit characterization of their technology in the microgravity environment. Future utilization of SPHERES as a facility will grow its capabilities as a platform for science, technology development, and education.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20150002695, "endDate": "2014-07-16T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "NASA In-Space Inspection Technology Workshop (ISIW 2014)", "location": "Houston, TX", "id": "96e3f7e0c31b41208935776a7d5c74f2", "startDate": "2014-07-15T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20150002695, "id": "6612f82bab464ede973b67541aa77fad", "publicationDate": "2014-07-16T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20150002695.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20150002695/downloads/20150002695.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20150002695/downloads/20150002695.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20150002695/downloads/20150002695.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
