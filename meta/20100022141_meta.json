It is directly responsible for the integration and test of the Integrated Science Instrument Module (ISIM), which includes a composite truss structure provided by NASA, and four science instruments sponsored and provided by NASA, the European Space Agency (ESA), the Canadian Space Agency (CSA), and the European Consortium (EC). Three of the four instruments are passively cooled and designed to operate at temperatures in the 36K to 40K range, and the fourth instrument is actively cooled to approximately 6K. The ISIM will undergo several performance tests at various levels of integration in the NASA Goddard Space Flight Center's (GSFC) Space Environment Simulator (SES), GSFC's largest thermal vacuum chamber. These activities range from Cryo-cycling the bare flight composite structure to thermal balance and performance testing of the full ISIM module. This paper describes the enhancements made to the SES chamber in order to support all cryogenic thermal vacuum testing of the ISIM. Upgrades discussed include: design and fabrication of a very large, removable and reconfigurable helium shroud; a new valve box permitting independent flow control of gaseous helium (GHe) to up to ten zones; and development of in-situ 3-dimensional photogrammetry capability in a cryogenic environment. Also presented will be select results from several facility tests already conducted to verify the chamber capabilities and optimize operational procedures, including the Helium Shroud -03 Configuration Acceptance Test, and the Helium Shroud -01 Configuration Chamber Certification Test.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "Spain", "submissionId": 20100022141, "endDate": "2010-07-15T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "International Conference on Environmental Systems (ICES)", "location": "Barcelona", "id": "afbcd73d57b6446db02c9d4884c05111", "startDate": "2010-07-12T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20100022141, "id": "806a0c0c6bdd45f6a75eec9d38b88630", "publicationDate": "2010-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20100022141.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20100022141/downloads/20100022141.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20100022141/downloads/20100022141.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20100022141/downloads/20100022141.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
