b'Recent Ground Hold and Rapid Depressurization Testing of\nMultilayer Systems\nWesley L. Johnson1\nNASA Glenn Research Center, Cleveland, OH, 44135, USA\n\nIn the development of flight insulation systems for large cryogenic orbital storage (spray\non foam and multilayer insulation), testing need include all environments that are\nexperienced during flight. While large efforts have been expended on studying, bounding,\nand modeling the orbital performance of the insulation systems, little effort has been\nexpended on the ground hold and ascent phases of a mission. Historical cryogenic in-space\nsystems that have flown have been able to ignore these phases of flight due to the insulation\nsystem being within a vacuum jacket. In the development phase of the Nuclear Mars\nVehicle and the Shuttle Nuclear Vehicle, several insulation systems were evaluated for the\nfull mission cycle. Since that time there had been minimal work on these phases of flight\nuntil the Constellation program began investigating cryogenic service modules and long\nduration upper stages. With the inception of the Cryogenic Propellant Storage and Transfer\nTechnology Demonstration Mission, a specific need was seen for the data and as such,\nseveral tests were added to the Cryogenic Boil-off Reduction System liquid hydrogen test\nmatrix to provide more data on a insulation system. Testing was attempted with both\ngaseous nitrogen (GN2) and gaseous helium (GHe) backfills. The initial tests with nitrogen\nbackfill were not successfully completed due to nitrogen liquefaction and solidification\npreventing the rapid pumpdown of the vacuum chamber. Subsequent helium backfill tests\nwere successful and showed minimal degradation. The results are compared to the\nhistorical data.\n\nNomenclature\n0\ncp\nf\nh\ni\nj\nk\nliq\nm\nt\nT\nt0\nTexit\nQ\n\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n\nV\n\n= volumetric flow rate, m3/s\n= density, kg/m3\n\nU\n\ninitial state\nspecific heat, J/kg/K\nfinal state\nspecific enthalpy, J/kg\ndiscrete time steps within a summation\ndiscrete volume spaces within the tank\ndiscrete section of tank surface\nliquid temperature, K\nmass, kg\ntime, s\ntemperature, K\ninitial time step, t = 0\nemperature of gas exiting the tank or control volume, K\nenergy, J\n\nI. Introduction\n\nC\n\nRYOGENIC propellants including liquid hydrogen and liquid methane in combination with liquid oxygen\nprovide the highest specific impulse of any reasonable propellant combination for chemical propulsion. As\nsuch, these propellant combinations are often sought out for use in upper stages and other in-space applications to\n1\n\nCryogenic Engineer, Cryogenic & Fluids Branch, 21000 Brookpark Road, M/S: 301-3, AIAA Senior Member.\n1\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nmaximize payload delivery for a given launch\nmass. Since not all missions allow for propellant\nusage in the first few hours of flight, long duration\ncryogenic storage (from 10 hours to several years)\nof propellant on-orbit has long been viewed as an\nenabling capability for the development of inspace assets. A requirements for long duration\ncryogenic storage is a high performance insulation\nsystem. One high performance insulation system\ntype is multilayer insulation (MLI), often referred\nto as superinsulation.\nFigure 1. Integrated Heat Leak over a notional flight\nOver the years many different entities have\ntimeline.\nstudied the performance of MLI in a high vacuum\nfor space applications.1-7 Fewer have studied MLI performance in an atmosphere of pressure and fewer yet have\nstudied MLI performance during the rapidly decreasing pressure experienced during launch where its thermal\nperformance is orders of magnitude worse than on orbit. The evacuation of the MLI is a complex phenomenon that\ncan drive the performance of the insulation for days after launch as all of the gas slowly leaves the thin spaces in\nbetween reflector layers built into the MLI. Instead of driving out all the details with the time dependancies of these\nphenomena, for a first order analysis, it is often easier to characterize this additional heat load as an integrated heat\nleak (see Figure 1).\nMultiple science payloads such as Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE), Superfluid Helium On-Orbit\nTransfer (SHOOT), Gravity Probe B, and the Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) have used small amounts of\nvarious cryogenic fluids such as hydrogen or helium lasting for up to five years.8-9 However, these payloads are\nsmall enough to use vacuum vessels around the cryogenic tank to mitigate need to understand the rapid evacuation\nof the MLI during launch, ascent, and the transition to on-orbit steady state thermal performance. In a non-vacuum\njacketed tank, these phases add an extra heat load to the system.\nInitial large scale MLI plans from the 1960s and 1970s performed rapid evacuation testing and gained a level of\nunderstanding of the rapid dynamics at play during rapid depressurization. 10-14 That understanding has dimenished\nover the years as the conquering of low earth orbit was the main goal of human exploration. In the past ten years,\nNASA has begun to improve upon the understanding of the transient performance of newer MLI systems and the\nresulting effect that these loads have on the performance of MLI in space. In 2009, NASA and Ball Aerospace\npartnered on liquid nitrogen testing of Ball Aerospace\xe2\x80\x99s high performance insulation system. In 2010, NASA\nperformed the Methane Lunar Surface Thermal Control (MLSTC) testing, which also included a rapid\ndepressurization test on a 48 inch diameter spherical test article. Work was done by NASA in 2011 studying\nambient temperature effects of multiple gasses evacuating from MLI systems. In 2013, NASA performed several\ndepressurization tests during the Cryogenic Boil-off Reduction System liquid hydrogen testing. A summary of all\ntest tanks is shown in Table 1.\nAs NASA prepares for the Cryogenic Propellant Storage and Transfer (CPST) Technology Demonstration\nMission, an understanding of the rapid depressurization of MLI systems will be required to ensure that enough\npropellant gets to orbit for the storage and transfer demonstration. The understanding and the testing and\nshortcomings that are always encountered in ground testing will be put to the test before the demonstration can\ncommence.\n\nII. Early Testing\nEarly development and testing of large scale MLI was done in preparation for the Modular Nuclear Vehicle. As\nMLI development progressed from basic understanding of performance to design and fabrication for large tanks, the\nunderstanding of the performance of MLI through all mission phases Due to the large range and rapidly changing\nheat loads MLI systems experience between ambient pressure and high vacuum, heat load measurements were not\nalways taken. However, on each of the tests, something interesting was recorded, and combined they give a\nreasonable overview of a wide body of knowledge.\nA. Lockheed, 196810\nIn 1967, Lockheed was given a contract to study the design of large scale multilayer insulation systems for a\nlong duration upper stage of the Modular Nuclear Vehicle. A large portion of their contract was focused on\nevacuation of the blanket, both analytically and experimentally.\n2\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nTable 1.

A 115 layer blanket, 38 mm (1.5 inch) thick\nblanket made of double aluminized Mylar and tissueglass was applied on the calorimeter for testing with liquid\nhydrogen and at ambient temperature. The blanket was made of three sub-blankets, each closed out with a buttseam that was offset 25 mm (1 inch) from the one below it.\nMeasurements included thermocouples within the MLI blanket and pressure transducers also within the MLI\nblankets. The pressure was read between each of the three blankets and referenced to the vacuum chamber using\ndelta Pressure transducers at the \xe2\x80\x9cno flow boundary\xe2\x80\x9d or furthest location from a seam.\nTesting was performed both with liquid hydrogen as a cold sink in the calorimeter and with no cold sink in the\ncalorimeter. It was expected that the pressure differentials would be higher at the ambient temperature than with the\nliquid hydrogen cold sink due to the decrease in helium viscosity with decreasing temperature. Testing on the\nambient temperature test showed a maximum differential pressure of 0.62 torr within the first 20-50 seconds of\ndepressurization. The pressure differentials during the liquid hydrogen sink test were lost due to a leak in the sense\nline. The temperature sensors never\nleveled off in the 22 hours of testing.\nIt was noted that after about 100\nseconds, the vacuum pump could not\nkeep up with the desired pressure\nprofile.\nB. McDonnell Douglas, 197311\nMcDonnell\nDouglas\nwas\nawarded a contract for the\ndevelopment of a MLI system for\nthe 105 inch diameter liquid\nhydrogen tank at MSFC. The tank\nwas 2.67 m (105 inches) in diameter\nand was filled to a depth of\napproximately 2.75 m (108 inches),\nthough the tank and insulation\nsystem were longer than that. The\nfinal MLI system selected for\ninstallation was a 70 layer blanket\nusing double-aluminized Mylar\n\nFigure 2: Photos of Superfloc (credit General Dynamics)\n\n3\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nreflectors and Dacron B4A netting spacers. While the target layer density of the blanket was 30 layer/cm, the final\ninstallation layer density ended up being 39 layer/cm due to a fabrication inconsistency within the netting procured\nfor the tank installation compared to the netting previously used. Two different tests were run, the first was a\nthermal test following a slow pumpdown of the vacuum chamber, the second test was a rapid depressurization test\nthat was followed by a steady state thermal test. It was noted that the heating rate in the second steady state thermal\ntest was 50% higher than in the first test. Post test examination of the blanket showed no indication of damage and\nthe difference was written off as an increase in trapped gas pressure between the warm and cold evacuations as\nexcess water vapor was measured degassing after the rapid depressurization using a residual gas analyzer. The\ntransient period after launch lasted for 50 hours before steady state was observed.\nIt is also of interest to note that an insulation system based on this development work was flown on the forward\ndome of the Skylab module. The performance of the 48 layer gored MLI installed on the forward dome appears to\nhave been nominal (1.3 \xe2\x80\x93 2.2 W/m2 on the outer surface of Skylab), though the performance had a wide variation due\nto the method of measurement on orbit. While no degradation over the first 6 months was observed, it was noted\nthat the method of measurement was not precise enough to determine if degradation was present. 12\nC. General Dynamics, 197513\nGeneral Dynamics was awarded a series of contracts to develop their MLI product called Superfloc. Superfloc\nconsisted of tufts of Dacron needles between double goldized mylar radiation shields as shown in Figure 2. The\nsystem was designed with a helium purge bag around 45 layers of Superfloc on a 2.21 m (87 inch) diameter tank.\nThe goal of the testing was to demonstrate that the MLI could survive 100 evacuation and repress cycles (similar to\npressure cycles that might be experienced on the Space Shuttle) while installed on a tank filled with liquid hydrogen.\nAfter 20 cycles an approximately 26% increase in total heat load was seen. After 51 cycles (the degradation was\nobserved to have leveled off), damage was repaired on a seam and the system rebaked out prior to the final 48 cycles\nbeing completed. The repair on the seam returned the orbital heat load within 10% of the original heat load and\nanother 10% degradation was seen during the last 48 cycles. The data is shown graphically in Figure 3.\n\nFigure 3. Effect of multiple rapid depressurizations on a single insulation system.\nD. Lewis Research Center, 197814\nTesting was done at Lewis Research Center on a 1.39 m diameter spherical tank using liquid hydrogen. The\nspherical tank had 2 sub-blankets of 15 layers each of double aluminized mylar and double aluminized mylar scrim\n4\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\ncloth covers separated by a single layer of silk net at a layer density of 17.7 layer/cm. Helium was used to actively\npurge the MLI so that no foam was necessary. No purge bag was used as it was assumed that the fairing\nsurrounding the vehicle would act as such a containment device. The test matrix consisted of 19 depressurization\ncycles at various conditions including the addition of water to the helium purge gas. This testing showed the most\nrapid adjustment of the flow to the rapid depressurization of the MLI on any of the tests. The data indicated that the\nblanket came to steady state over the course of a few hours. While a post test inspection of the blanket revealed no\ndamage to the blanket, the final orbital thermal performance test indicated minimal damage (12% total degradiation\nfrom initial testing) from the repeated pressure cycles. The heat load with the tank at one atmosphere was 620 W/m 2\nand mostly independent of purge flow rate or water content over the range tested.\nE. Marshall Space Flight Center, 199515\nIn the mid-1990s, Marshall Space Flight Center developed the Multipurpose Hydrogen Testbed (MHTB). The\ntest tank was a 3.05 m diameter by 3.05 m tall tank with 2:1 elliptical dome endcaps. The tank was insulated with\n35.6 mm (1.4 inches) of SOFI and 45 layers of variable density MLI so that it could be purged with nitrogen instead\nof helium. The first 10 layers of the blanket were designed for 8 layers/cm, the next 15 layers were designed at 12\nlayers/cm, and the final 20 layers were designed at 16 layer/cm. The layer density variation was developed using\nvarying numbers of Dacron netting bumper strips. The purpose of the testing was to demonstrate the survival of a\nfull mission thermal profile. Thus on at least two occations, rapid depressurization tests were performed. While\nthere were figures published showing the heat load and pressure as a function of time, no analysis had previously\nbeen published on the total heat load the system had seen. Fortunately, the data had not been lost and was provided\nfor further analysis. The first rapid depressurization test had an integrated heat load of 323 kJ/m2 and the second test\nhad an integrated heat load of 317 kJ/m2. It should however be noted, that during the second pumpdown there was\nan issue with the vacuum pumps stalling at the pressure of a few Torr for around 10 hours that added an extra 700\nkJ/m2 which has been subtracted out. While it was noted in the publication that it seemed like the second\npumpdown went smoother and quicker, the actual applied heat load did not change much between the two tests.\n\nIII. Recent Testing\nOver the last 10 years, testing high performance insulations systems throughout the various mission phases has\nreturned. In addition to several liquid nitrogen based tests, a liquid methane test and a series of non-cryogenic tests\nwere run.\nA. Ball Aerospace, 2007-200916-17\nFocusing on MLI designs for liquid oxygen and liquid methane tanks, Ball Aerospace performed a series of\nrapid depressurization testing of their MLI systems on their 500 liter (0.85 m diameter) liquid nitrogen test article.\nAll of the MLI were designed with 40 layers at a layer density of between 7 and 10 layers/cm. No foam substrate\nwas included as it would not be needed to prevent nitrogen liquefaction on an oxygen or methane tank. Testing\nincluded one system with seam venting and one with perforations and slits, additionally tests on the perforated\nsystem were run with backfill of both nitrogen and helium gasses. Attempts were made during the non-perforated\nMLI test to measure the differential temperature between the inner MLI layer and the vacuum chamber and a central\nMLI layer and the vacuum chamber. Finally, two different pumpdown rates were tested.\nIn the initial phase of perforated MLI testing, the stagnant helium backfilled MLI (118 W/m2) was shown to have\na heat load that was 2 -3 times higher than what was achieved with the stagnant nitrogen backfilled MLI (43 \xe2\x80\x93 50\nW/m2). Similarly during the pumpdown, the integrated heat load was higher with helium gas in the MLI system\n(457 kJ/m2 for helium, 364 kJ/m2 for nitrogen). After rapid pumpdown, in all cases the MLI performance was seen\nto degrade 30 \xe2\x80\x93 60% of the initial heat load (0.23 W/m2 on the initial test to 0.30 \xe2\x80\x93 0.36 W/m2 on subsequent testing)\nwith no noticeable different between the helium and nitrogen testing.\nIn the second phase of non-perforated MLI testing (nitrogen backfill only), the depressurization performance was\nslightly worse at 404 kJ/m2 for a rapid pumpdown and 480 kJ/m2 for a slower pumpdown. This does indicate that\nfor this design the perforations and slits were more efficient at venting the blanket and bringing the tank to steady\nstate. Measurement of the pressure differential showed that in all cases, the pressure differential in the middle of the\nMLI was greater than at the tank wall when compared to the vacuum chamber (2.6 torr in the blanket versus 2.1 torr\non the tank for the rapid pumpdown and 0.39 torr in the blanket versus 0.28 torr on the tank for the slow\npumpdown.). This was also much higher than the perforated pumpdown (0.08 torr on the tank for a slow\npumpdown). This is inline with the predictions done by Lockheed in the 1960s that showed that due to the changes\nin viscosity of the gas, it was easier to evacuate a cold non-condensible vapor than a warm one.\n5\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nAnalytical attempts were made to predict the thermal performance of the system during rapid depressurization\nand these were not successful. The analytical model predicted an integrated heat load several times less than what\nwas actually measured. This was mainly due to the measured boil-off flow rate not dropping off as quickly as\npredicted. While several items such as MLI thermal mass, blanket outgassing, and gas storage heat loads were\ninvestigated, none proved to have a large impact. The extra heat load was thought to be mainly due to the storage\nand slow release of energy in the tank walls (for which the testing was not set up to measure).\nB. Methane Lunar Surface Thermal Control Testing (MLSTC), 201018-19\nThe MLSTC testing was run at Glenn Research Center in 2010 to demonstrate the various thermal control\nscenarios that the Altair (lunar lander envisioned during the Constellation program) methane tanks would encounter\nduring their trip to the moon. Of the environments tested, one was a rapid depressurization. While it was attempted\nto embed local pressure sensors within the MLI blankets at various locations, it was determined on breadboard\ntesting that the sensors did not respond well. During data reduction, it was noticed that the heavy manway on the\ntop of the tank accounted for a large quantity of the integrated heat load (956 kJ). This was because the thermal\nresistance of the conduction path connecting the tank lid to the liquid was of similar order of magnitude to that of the\nenergy coming through the insulation. Thus the temperature on the lid increased during ground hold, but when a\nvacuum was pulled, the thermal resistance of the blankets were much greater than that of the conduction path and\nthe temperature of the manway dropped, effectively dumping large amounts of heat into the liquid over a several day\nperiod. The total heat flux on the system at an atmosphere of pressure with a warm boundary temperature of 305 K\nwas 52 W/m2 and the total integrated heat load was 154 kJ/m2. An attempt was made at predicting the thermal\nperformance of the MLI system thermal performance through the rapid depressurization test. The pre-test\npredictions were found to be unreliable. However, after adding the upper tank manway mass to the model, the\npredictions were much closer to the actual test performance. Figure 4 shows the model progression from pre-test to\npost test as well as the test data.\n\nFigure 4. Modeling results from the MLSTC testing.\n\n6\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nC. Glenn Research Center MLI/BAC Evacuation, 201120\nIn 2011, Glenn Research Center performed a series of rapid depressurization tests on 60 layer MLI panels with\nbroad area cooling (BAC) shields. The objectives of the testing was to investigate any structural issues for\nsupporting a broad area cooling shield during the rapid depressurization phase of flight. Testing only went from 101\nkPa to approximately 2 kPa (20 Torr) and testing was at room temperature and with a heater on the back to increase\ntemperature during some of the tests. Pressure measurements were made across the blanket to the vacuum chamber\nand there were two video cameras and a thermal (IR) camera to watch for blanket billowing during pumpdown and\n\xe2\x80\x9chot spots\xe2\x80\x9d (when the heater was in use). Testing specimens ranged from MLI only, MLI with a BAC shield loosely\nfloating in the MLI blanket, and MLI with a BAC shield firmly held down. Over 30 rapid evacutation tests were run\nusing both nitrogen and argon gas. Three different pumping rates were testing and as with the Ball testing, it was\nobserved that the faster the pump down, the earlier and larger the delta pressure spike within the MLI blankets. The\nlargest pressure differential seen using gaseous nitrogen was 1.3 torr and with gaseous argon 1.5 torr. Argon always\nshowed a slightly higher pressure drop due to the fact that the viscosity of argon is 25% higher than nitrogen.\n\nIV. Cryogenic Boil-Off Reduction System Rapid Depressurization Testing\nDuring recent Cryogenic Boil-Off Reduction System testing in the Small Multipurpose Research Facility\n(SMiRF) at Glenn Research Center in 2013, a series of rapid depressurization tests were conducted on the Self\nSupporting Multilayer Insulation (SS-MLI) test article. The testing was an attempt to gather system effects of\ninstalling a Broad Area Cooling (BAC) shield within a foam/MLI system. Testing was performed with liquid\nhydrogen with both gaseous nitrogen and gaseous helium as the \xe2\x80\x9cpurge\xe2\x80\x9d gas. Neither purge was a constant flow\npurge, rather the gas was backfilleded to maintain a constant pressure within the vacuum chamber prior to\npumpdown. As such, they could be considered a stagnant purge or a backfill.\nA. Test Article Design\nThe tank was a 1.2 meter diameter by 1.4 m\nlong.\nThe first layer of Spray on Foam\nInsulation (SOFI) was designed with the domes\nin a truncated cone shape to make MLI\ninstallation around the various flanges easier.\nThe SOFI ranged from 19 mm thick around the\ncylindrical section of the tank to as thick as 0.1 m\naround some of the fluid lines on the top of the\ndome. On top of the SOFI was the inner MLI\nblanket consisting of 19 layers of Load Bearing\nMLI (LB-MLI) at a total thickness of 35.6 mm.\nThe LB-MLI had a 0.01% open area perforation\nand was designed based on nitrogen flow through\nthe\nblanket\nto\nsurvive\nthe\nrapid\ndepressurization.The function of the LB-MLI\nwas to support the BAC shield, which was a\ndistributed cooling network that was attached to\nFigure 5. Tank Applied Insulation System.\na 90 K class cryocooler for other test\n21\nobjectives. On top of the BAC shield was 30\nmore layers of a more traditional MLI made of double aluminized polyethelene terephthalate reflecting shield (1%\nopen), each reflector having two layers of polyester netting between them. The thickness of the outer MLI blanket\nwas also 35 mm. The tank surface area was 6.2 m2, the outer layer of MLI had an area of 7.3 m2, the mean area of\nthe insulation system being 7.07 m2. The test article and insulation system are shown in Figure 5. A more detailed\ndescription of the insulation system and design parameters can be found in Johnson, Valenzuela, et.al.22\nB. Test Matrix and Test Operations\n\n7\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nFour different tests were carried out, the first three were\nTable 2. Pressure Channel for Vacuum\nunsuccessful and the fourth was successful. The original intent of\nChamber Pressures.\nthe test program was to perform the rapid depressurization testing\nPressure\nTime \xe2\x80\x93 low Time \xe2\x80\x93 high\nusing nitrogen gas as the backfill gas within the vacuum chamber.\n(Torr)\n(s)\n(s)\nIn order to define the rapid depressurization pressure profile, a\n760\n0\n0\n\xe2\x80\x9cchannel\xe2\x80\x9d was given to the SMiRF operators based on historical\n700\n6\n20\ndepressurization tests and the Space Shuttle payload bay\n600\n15\n30\ndepressurization rate (see Table 2).\n500\n20\n40\nThe first test with nitrogen gas in the chamber started with the\n400\n28\n50\ntank at approximately 90% full remaining from the previous boil300\n35\n60\noff testing at high vacuum. The chamber was backfilled with\nnitrogen gas to approximately 760 Torr (101.3 kPa) and the tank\n200\n50\n75\nallowed to come to steady state before pumping down. All went\n100\n60\n100\nsmoothly for the first few minutes (the initial portion of the testing\nfit nicely into the provided channel) of depressurization, but the\nvacuum pumping rates became noticeably slow below 1 Torr (0.13 kPa). Since this kept the pressure within the\nMLI and thus the heat load on the tank higher, by the time the test crew returned the following morning, the liquid\nlevel was below 50%. As this would not allow for a successful completion of the testing, the test was terminated\nand the tank drained. Post test review of the temperature of 5 silicone diodes that were on the SOFI surface\nindicated a pooling of liquid turned solid nitrogen in the bottom of the MLI blanket on the SOFI surface. The solid\nntirogen took at least 5 hours to sublimate by pumping it through the blanket (see Figure 6). While all other SOFI\ntemperature point sensors remained above 100 K, liquefaction was not assumed to be on the bottom of the tank as\nthe liquefaction could have occurred elsewhere away from the point sensors and flowed down the side of the tank\nbefore accumulating at the bottom.\n\nFigure 6. Foam surface temperatures during first rapid depressurization test attempt. Time elapsed from the\nstart of the pumpdown.\n\n8\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nFollowing the review of the first test data discussions were held as to what was the proper step going forward. A\nphysical investigation of the insulation at this point would have been useful, but, due to the time required to remove\nthe tank from the vacuum chamber and the MLI off of the tank, it would not have allowed for further testing. It was\ndecided to try a test with the tank warm (not cold) in hopes that the liquefaction had been caused by test operations\nand breaking the vacuum on the foam while it was still cold from high vacuum testing (steady state high vacuum test\ndata showed the foam at ~30 K). Additionally, it was desired to get pressure rise data to at sometime during the 760\ntorr test period to simulate tank condictions on the pad and how quickly tank pressure reacted to the high heat loads\nassociated with gas filled MLI.\nThe second test was operated as described above (and shown in Figure 7). The tank was filled and then once the\nsystem was somewhat steady, the tank pressure was slowly raised to 138 kPa (20 psia). Then the tank was locked\nup for approximately 10.6 minutes (634 s) while the tank pressure rose from 159 kPa (23 psia) to 280 kPa (40.7\npsia), for a pressure rise rate of 11.5 kPa/min. A majority of the heat was into the liquid on the bottom of the tank as\nindicated by LL-2, LL-3, and LL-4 rising the fastest despite being towards the bottom of the tank, furthest from the\nliquid-vapor interface. However, during pumpdown, the same issues with a slow pumpdown and solid nitrogen\nformation were seen as in the first test, and testing was halted after a few hours.\n\nFigure 7. Tank pressure and liquid temperatures during pressure rise test with nitrogen background.\nFollowing the second test there was further discussion on the forward test plan. The desire for a post-test foam\nand MLI inspection was growing rapidly. However, to hedge the possibility that the foam was too thin in some\nplaces (as opposed to having separated in others), it was decided to run a third and final test using helium as the\nbackfill gas. The test would be run identically to the second nitrogen pumpdown (including pressure rise test).\n\n9\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nPressure, Torr\n\nThe third test with helium ran\n800\nnearly\nflawlessly.\nThe\ndepressurization of the vacuum\n700\nV047\nchamber of the helium pumpdown is\nshown in Figure 8. The tank was\nV048\n600\nfilled to approximately 90 % full and\ntopped off several times. SOFI\nchannel low\n500\ntemperatures all stayed well above\nchannel high\n100 K. The pressure rise portion of\n400\nthe test was run for 10.8 minutes\n(647 s) and the pressure rose from\n300\n98.6 kPa (14.3 psia) to 290.5 kPa\n(42.2 psia), a pressure rise rate of\n17.8 kPa/min (2.59 psi/min). Figure\n200\n9 shows the tank and fluid\ntemperatures and pressures during\n100\nthe pressure rise period (the pump\ndown started 7.4 minutes into the\n0\npressure rise test). It is interesting to\n2.04\n2.06\n2.08\n2.1\n2.12\n2.14\nTime, hr\nnotice that the liquid hydrogen was\nFigure 8. Pressure profile during helium rapid depressurization testing.\nmuch more uniform in both\ntemperature and temperature rise rate during the helium test (when compared to the nitrogen test).\nPost helium test analysis of the foam performance indicated that the foam was not too thin. SOFI surface diodes\nindicated that all surface temperatures were over 100 K. A post test dissection of the test hardware indicated several\nplaces in the thicker areas of the tank that the foam had cracked and even come loose (refered to as divoting) on the\ntop of the tank. Several cracks were seen around the Velcro that was used to hold the LB-MLI in place.\nUninsulated liquid feedlines in the tank that during the fill process at 1 atmosphere that would have contributed to\nthe build up of liquid nitrogen running down the tank wall and pooling at the bottom.\nThe post test examinations and data analysis reinforced that for a rapid evacuation test using liquid hydrogen,\neverything must be properly insulated to prevent purge gas liquefaction and solification. The post test examination\nalso brought a recommendation against spraying SOFI in thicknesses greater than approximately an inch to an inch\nand a half and also in general brought into question the capability of SOFI to function as a part of a rigid support\nstructure for any external insulation loads. It is possible that adding more velcro may have solved the issue by\nreducing stresses on the existing Velcro attachments. Divoting was a common occurance during shuttle flights and\nwas attributed as the main culprit of the loss of STS-107 (Columbia).23 As such, the foam issues were known, but\naccepted for this test program. The main cause of divoting and cracking in the foam is the difference in thermal\nexpansion between the base tank material, the epoxy primers that allow the foam to stick to the base metal better and\nthe foam itself.\nAfter the pressure rise testing was completed, the tank was slowly let down to a constant back pressure of just\nunder 20 psia at a rate that allowed the boil-off mass flow meters to read fairly close to their full scale range. This\nprocess took approximately 10 minutes and did lead to some uncertainty in the total integrated heat load on the tank\ndue to flow meter reading.\nThe early pressure portion of the pumpdown fit well within the channel as shown in Figure 8. The vacuum\nchamber was less than a Torr in 3 minutes, it eclipsed 10 -5 Torr within just over half of an hour and was in the 1 x\n10-6 Torr range within a few hours.\nC. Test Results and Discussion\nBased on the mass flow meter data, the integrated heat load due to boil-off flow was calculated as shown in\nequation 1. The first term on the right hand side of equation 1 represents the entire heat load into the storage tank\nover a given time frame. The second term subtracts off the steady state flow rate for the same time (i.e. if the test\ntank had been directly inserted into orbit at steady state, as shown in Figure 1). Equation 1 was descritized to use\nthe available data recorded at a given sample rate (once every second for the first 20 minutes, once every 5 seconds\nfor the ensuing 10 minutes, once a minute through the following 15 minutes, and once every 5 minutes for the rest of\nthe test) using equation 2.\n\n10\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nFigure 9.

The first relates to the liquid\ntemperature change during the actual test (pressurization was allowed, and then that energy was vented off). The\nsecond relates to the period during the vent off, which can be calculated by including that time frame in equation 1,\nbut also can be bound by ignoring that it existed (minimum) or assuming the on ground heat load was present the\nentire time (maximum). The net liquid temperature changes over the duration of the test are accounted for in\nequation 3. Since the liquid warmed up, the test tank also warmed up in the liquid region, however, as was noted by\nJohnson8 in the ullage region it cooled down, equation 4 shows how the net heat load was calculated. Equation 3\nalso allows the calculation of the energy absorbed during the locked up portion of the test, which is assumed to be\nessentially the ground heat load. Based on the eight liquid temperature sensors on the diode rake within the test\ntank, the bulk liquid mass was broken into eight nodes, analysis went from after the pressure from the pressure rise\ntest had vented to the end of the test. Similarly, based on three tank surface sensors (two on the liquid and one on\nthe ullage), the tank was broken up into three nodes for evaluation.\n\n\xc2\xa6V U >h \x0bT\nj 8\n\nQliq\n\nj\n\nj\n\nj ,tf\n\nf\n\n@\n\n, Pf \x0c \x10 h j ,t 0 \x0bT0 , P0 \x0c\n\nj 1\n\n11\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\n(3)\n\n\xc2\xa6 m c \x0bT \x0c\x0bT\nk 3\n\nQtan k\n\nk\n\np\n\nk, f\n\n\x10 Tk ,0 \x0c\n\n(4)\n\nk 1\n\nU\n\nU tf \x0bT f , Pf \x0c \x0e U t 0 \x0bT0 , P0 \x0c\n2\n\n(5)\n\n1.

Since on a uniformly insulated tank, the pressure rise rate\nshould be proportional to heat load, the awkward relationship between heat load and pressure rise rate of the\nindicates that there was a change in the heat load distribution between the liquid and vapor regions of the test article.\nMore specifically, this points to the addition of heat load into the liquid portion of the tank from liquefaction and\nsolidification of the nitrogen backfill gas.\n2. Rapid Depressurization Heat Loads\nTable 4 shows the summary of heat loads in the helium rapid depressurization test. The steady state energy input\nis 3.56 W over the approximately 69.5 hour test duration (the second term in equation 2). The integrated flow\nenergy input is from the flow meter as calculated through the first term of equation 2. The tank temperature term is\nthe results of the data calculated through equation 4 and the liquid temperature energy input is as calculated through\nequation 3.\nDue to some time while the pressure was being released and flowing higher than the maximum flow of the flow\nmeter (i.e. the flow meter was off-scale high), several different scenarios are accounted for. Using the data available\nthe actual heat input into the tank was bounded using worst case assumptions and then a probable input was\nincluded. The minimum energy through the system is shown in the Total Min row, which is simply the sum of the\nIntegrated Flow, Tank Temperature, and Liquid temperature terms. Then the Steady state term is subtracted in the\nsecond column and the energy input is normalized over the 7.07 square meter mean surface area of the tank. The\nfinal column shows at the normal boiling point, what percentage of the tank volume of liquid hydrogen would be\nboiled off. The energy input that was integrated during the unsteady time (the first 570 seconds of test) is shown\nnext and the \xe2\x80\x9cMost Probable\xe2\x80\x9d line is merely the sum of the \xe2\x80\x9cTotal Min\xe2\x80\x9d and the flow meter integrated over the\nunsteady time. The maximum heat load that could have come into the tank during those 570 seconds would be the\nsteady state heat load at ambient pressure (1.21 kW). Applying that heat load over the 570 seconds and adding to\nthe minimum heat load gives the total maximum heat load that could have been seen by the tank.\nAfter the rapid pumpdown test came to steady state, the heat load was 3.56 W. This is only 0.24 W (7.3%) worse\nthan the passive test earlier in the test matrix (prior to the rapid depressurization test). This shows minimal\ndegradation after the blanket was put through several rapid depressurizations, including two where solid nitrogen\nwas known to accumulate, making the pressure gradient on the blanket worse than normal (essentially the nitrogen\noutgassing throught the blanket is what prevented the chamber from pumping down).\n12\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nD. Comparison with Previous Testing\nComparing the multiple tests together, several general trends can be seen in Table 5. First, on the ground, the\nhighest heat load is when a blanket is backfilled with helium gas underneath the blanket. Tests with just an external\nhelium backfill show a decrease in heat low of a factor of at least 3 and maybe more, and active purge under the\nblanket has even further degradation in performance. Using nitrogen as a purge gas and purging or backfilling\nexternally decreases the heat load by another factor of 2 \xe2\x80\x93 3. However, there is not a large difference during the\nrapid ascent. The helium gas systems do have a slightly higher integrated heat load, but only by roughly 25%.\nWhile an MLI blanket can be damage to the blanket during rapid depressurization (as seen in the General Dynamics\nand McDonnell Douglas testing), if designed for, the blanket can easily survive multiple pressure cycles with\nminimal pressure gradients across them.\nTable 4.

Conclusions\nRecently during the Cryogenic Boil-off Reduction System testing a series of rapid depressurization tests were\nrun using a flight representative methodology for integrating broad area cooling within the multilayer insulation\nsystem. They brought out several issues with the test methodology and design. After several failed nitrogen\nbackfilled rapid depressurization tests, a successful helium backfill test was completed. The ground heat load with a\nstatic helium backfill was 171 W/m2 and the integrated heat load during rapid depressurization was 196 kJ/m2. The\ndegradation seen in the insulation system after the rapid depressurization test series was just over seven percent.\nA summary of all known rapid depressurization testing is presented along with the highlights from each test.\nThe tests show several trends that indicate that the design of a insulation system designed for rapid depressurization\nis achievable. The measured pressure difference across the insulation blanket is low, the thermal penalty is on the\norder of 3 -5 days of steady state orbital heat loads, and blankets can survive multiple pressure cycles if the venting\nis properly allowed for. The body of data throughout the years brings a good basis for estimating system design for\nactual flight systems.\n\nAcknowledgments\nThe author would like to acknowledge the test team at the Small Multipurpose Research Facility (Glenn\nResearch Center) lead by Craig Robinson and Helmut Bamberger for their hard work during the Cryogenic Boil-off\nReduction System testing and Kevin Pedersen for digging out the MHTB data sets for further analysis.
