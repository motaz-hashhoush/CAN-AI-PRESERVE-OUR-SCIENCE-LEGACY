Ingenuity was successfully deployed from its protective shroud on the underside of the Mars 2020 Perseverance Rover and has flown 17 flights on Mars as of December 2021. A number of rotorcraft analysis tools were utilized, and a series of experimental tests were performed to ready Ingenuity for its launch with the Perseverance Rover in July 2020. In this paper, RotCFD, a Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes flow solver, is used to model Ingenuity in hover and forward flight for the purposes of validating tools to aid in the development of a future generation of Mars rotorcraft. The results from the RotCFD modeling are benchmarked against results from hover performance tests of the Ingenuity prototype in the 25-Foot Space Simulator at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and are also compared to hover and forward flight predictions made by CAMRAD II, a well-known comprehensive rotorcraft analysis code. Surrogate performance models are trained to obtain a set of trimmed rotor settings for Ingenuity at different forward flight speeds, which are then used as inputs for the RotCFD forward flight simulations. Additionally, a study of the airframe-rotor interaction and a study of the aerodynamics of the individual airframe components of Ingenuity in forward flight are performed. Finally, to better understand performance predictions by RotCFD and CAMRAD II, a study is conducted on how sectional angles of attack in each code vary with radial station and azimuth.
