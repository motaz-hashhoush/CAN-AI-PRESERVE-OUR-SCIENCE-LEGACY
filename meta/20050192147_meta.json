NASA has extensive experience with fuel cells, having used them on manned space flight systems over four decades. Consequently, the NASA Glenn Research Center has initiated an effort to investigate and develop fuel cell technologies for multiple aerospace applications. Two promising fuel cell types are the proton exchange membrane (PEM) and solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC). PEM technology, first used on the Gemini spacecraft in the sixties, remained unutilized thereafter until the automotive industry recently recognized the potential. PEM fuel cells are low-temperature devices offering quick startup time but requiring relatively pure hydrogen fuel. In contrast, SOFCs operate at high temperatures and tolerate higher levels of impurities. This flexibility allows SOFCs to use hydrocarbon fuels, which is an important factor considering our current liquid petroleum infrastructure. However, depending on the specific application, either PEM or SOFC can be attractive. As only NASA can, the Agency is pursuing fuel cell technology for civil uninhabited aerial vehicles (UAVs) because it offers enhanced scientific capabilities, including enabling highaltitude, long-endurance missions. The NASA Helios aircraft demonstrated altitudes approaching 100,000 ft using solar power in 2001, and future plans include the development of a regenerative PEM fuel cell to provide nighttime power. Unique to NASA's mission, the high-altitude aircraft application requires the PEM fuel cell to operate on pure oxygen, instead of the air typical of terrestrial applications.", "title": "Emerging Fuel Cell Technology Being Developed: Offers Many Benefits to Air Vehicles", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-07T12:08:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20050192147, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Walker, James F."}, "organization": {}}, "id": "8b5962bce9944171a27a2aab827a3769"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 20050192147, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Civinskas, Kestutis C."}, "organization": {}}, "id": "c4f5e437710142d3a351976bd4bef716"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20050192147, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20050192147, "id": "73cb973e7d76420db46fc1dd2d2e96bf", "publicationName": "Research and Technology 2003", "publicationDate": "2004-05-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20050192147.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20050192147/downloads/20050192147.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20050192147/downloads/20050192147.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20050192147/downloads/20050192147.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
