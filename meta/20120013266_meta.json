A 2009 analysis by the NASA Orbital Debris Program Office shows that, in order to maintain the LEO debris population at a constant level for the next 200 years, an active debris removal of about five objects per year is needed. The targets identified for removal are those with the highest mass and collision probability products in the environment. Many of these objects are spent upper stages with masses ranging from 1 to more than 8 metric tons, residing in several altitude regions and concentrated in about 7 inclination bands. To remove five of those objects on a yearly basis, in a cost-effective manner, represents many challenges in technology development, engineering, and operations. This paper outlines the fundamental rationale for considering active debris removal and addresses the two possible objectives of the operations -- removing large debris to stabilize the environment and removing small debris to reduce the threat to operational spacecraft. Technological and engineering challenges associated with the two different objectives are also discussed.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "Japan", "submissionId": 20120013266, "endDate": "2011-06-12T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "Japan Society for Aeronautical and Space Sciences", "location": "Tokyo, Japan"}}, "meetingId": "1dab464b54454d1ca97ea073e0fd52c2", "id": "b7de9127df7f4d27b5dbc2171e2820ed"}], "name": "28th International Symposium on Space Technology", "location": "Ginowan City, Okinawa Prefecture", "id": "1dab464b54454d1ca97ea073e0fd52c2", "startDate": "2011-06-06T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20120013266, "id": "4ca68f4d76dd4bf18568ad19a97a73fb", "publicationDate": "2012-07-17T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20120013266.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20120013266/downloads/20120013266.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20120013266/downloads/20120013266.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20120013266/downloads/20120013266.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
