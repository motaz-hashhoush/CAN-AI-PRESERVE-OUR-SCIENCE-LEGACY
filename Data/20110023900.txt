b'164-GHz MMIC HEMT Frequency Doubler\nConversion loss is lower than that of other HEMT frequency doublers above 100 GHz.\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California\nA monolithic microwave integrated\ncircuit (MMIC) that includes a high-electron-mobility transistor (HEMT) has\nbeen developed as a prototype of improved frequency doublers for generating signals at frequencies >100 GHz.

The Output Power and Conversion Loss of the frequency doubler were measured as functions of frequency.\n\nnal sources that operate in this frequency\nrange are needed for a variety of applications, notably including general radiometry and, more specifically, radiometric\nremote sensing of the atmosphere.\nHeretofore, it has been common practice to use passive (diode-based) frequency multipliers to obtain frequencies\n>100 GHz. Unfortunately, diode-based\nfrequency multipliers are plagued by\nhigh DC power consumption and low\nconversion efficiency. Moreover, multiplier diodes are not easily integrated with\nsuch other multiplier-circuit components\nas amplifiers and oscillators. The goals of\ndeveloping the present MMIC HEMT frequency doubler were (1) to utilize the\nHEMT as an amplifier to increase conversion efficiency (more precisely, to reduce\nconversion loss), thereby increasing the\noutput power for a given DC power con-\n\nsumption or, equivalently, reducing the\nDC power consumption for a given output power; and (2) to provide for the integration of amplifier and oscillator components on the same chip.\nThe MMIC frequency doubler (see Figure 1) contains an AlInAs/GaInAs/InP\nHEMT biased at pinch-off to make it function as a class-B amplifier (meaning that it\nconducts in half-cycle pulses). Grounded\ncoplanar waveguides (GCPWs) are used\nas impedance-matching transmission\nlines. Air bridges are placed at discontinuities to suppress undesired slot electromagnetic modes. Another combination of\nGCPWs also serves both as a low-pass filter\nto suppress undesired oscillations at frequencies below 60 GHz and as a DC\nblocker. Large decoupling capacitors and\nepitaxial resistors are added in the drain\nand gate lines to suppress bias oscillations.\n\nAt the output terminal, the fundamental\nfrequency is suppressed by a quarter-wave\nopen stub, which presents a short circuit\nat the fundamental frequency and an\nopen circuit at the second harmonic.\nAt an input power of 7 mW, the output\npower and conversion loss at an output\nfrequency of 164 GHz were found to be\n5 dBm (\xe2\x89\x883.2 mW) and 2 dB, respectively,\nwith a 3-dB output-power bandwidth of\n14 GHz. This is the best performance reported to date for an MMIC HEMT frequency doubler above 100 GHz.\nThis work was done by Lorene Samoska of\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Vesna\nRadisic, Miro Micovic, Ming Hu, Paul\nJanke, Catherine Ngo, and Loi Nguyen of\nHRL Laboratories, LLC, and Matthew Morgan of Caltech.

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nCircuit boards that contain radio-frequency (RF) and digital circuitry have\nbeen developed by NASA to satisfy a\nrequirement of the Port of Houston Authority for relatively inexpensive Global\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, September 2003\n\nPositioning System (GPS) receivers that\nindicate the azimuthal headings as well as\nthe positions of ships. The receiver design\nutilizes the unique architecture of the\nMitel commercial chip-set, which provides\n\nfor an accurate GPS-based heading-determination device. The major components\ninclude two RF front ends (each connected to a separate antenna), a surfaceacoustic-wave intermediate-frequency fil-\n\n11\n\nter between second- and third-stage mixers, a correlator, and a reduced-instruction-set computer. One of the RF front\nends operates as a master, the other as a\nslave. Both RF front ends share a 10-MHz\nsinusoidal clock oscillator, which provides\nfor more accurate carrier phase measurements between the two antennas. The outputs of the RF front ends are subjected to\nconventional GPS processing. The com-\n\n12\n\nmercial-based chip-set design approach\nprovides an inexpensive \xe2\x80\x9copen architecture\xe2\x80\x9d GPS platform, which can be used in\ndeveloping and implementing unique\nGPS-heading and attitude-determination\nalgorithms for specific applications. The\nheading is estimated from the GPS position solutions of the two antennas by an algorithm developed specifically for this application. If a third (and preferably a\n\nfourth) antenna were added, it would be\npossible to estimate the attitude of the\nGPS receiver in three dimensions instead\nof only its heading in a horizontal plane.\nThis work was done by Michael P. Cooke,\nHester J. Yim, and Susan F. Gomez of Johnson Space Center. Further information is\ncontained in a TSP (see page 1).\nMSC-23125\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, September 2003\n\n'
