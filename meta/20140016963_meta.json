Multipurpose Cargo Transfer Bags (MCTB) have been designed such that they can serve the same purpose as a Cargo Transfer Bag, the suitcase-shaped common logistics carrying bag for Shuttle and the International Space Station. After use as a cargo carrier, a regular CTB becomes trash, whereas the MCTB can be unzipped, unsnapped, and unfolded to be reused. Reuse ideas that have been investigated include partitions, crew quarters, solar radiation storm shelters, acoustic blankets, and forward osmosis water processing.", "title": "Multipurpose Cargo Transfer Bag", "stiType": "PRESENTATION", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2014-12-03T16:26:08.3270000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20140016963, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Broyan, James"}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Johnson Space Center", "location": "Houston, TX, United States"}}, "id": "224e1fd94cff45f487142a5717581ea5"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 20140016963, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Baccus, Shelley"}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Johnson Space Center", "location": "Houston, TX, United States"}}, "id": "75b01e38ec494d3f972cad3409c29620"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Presentation", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "id": 20140016963, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20140016963, "id": "a6521c244e564e5c8d043e890f9f5571", "publicationDate": "2014-11-18T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20140016963.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20140016963/downloads/20140016963.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20140016963/downloads/20140016963.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20140016963/downloads/20140016963.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
