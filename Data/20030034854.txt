Detect, see and avoid technology is vital if remotely piloted or autonomous aircraft\nare ro be integrated into the airspace system shared\nwith inhabited aircraft.\nThe tests rook place April 1-4 near Mojave, Calif.,\nand were sponsored by ASA Dryden Flight Research\nCenter under the Environmental Research Aircraft and\nSensor Technology (ERAST) program.\n"The goal of the tesc was ro be able to make a decision based on radar data in enough lead time to\nmaneuver the test aircraft to avoid a close encounter\nwith the intruder aircraft," said Glenn Hamilron,\nUAV Subsystems Project Manager at NASA Dryden.\nScaled Composites\' Proteus aircraft, with safety\npilots on board but controlled from the ground like a\ntrue UAV, was repeatedly directed away from conflicting\nflight paths with a variety of aircraft, some of which\ndid not emit any signals to show their positions in\nthe sky.\n\nResearchers Encouraged by\n\nCo lision-Avoidance Test\n\nScaled Composites\' Proteus aircrah with an F/A-18 Hornet and a Beechaah KingAir from NASA\nDryden Flight Research Center during a low-level flyby at Mojave Airport in Southern C\nalifornia_\n\nIn all 20 scenarios flown, Proteus\' ground operator\nwas able to detect the presence of other airctaft that\nposed the potential for collisions, maneuvering the test\naircraft to keep the intruding aircraft outside an imaginary\nSOO-fe. bubble of safe airspace surrounding Proteus .\nThe conflicting aircraft ranged greatly in speed, from a\nNASA F/A-18 high-speed jet to several types of general aviation aircraft and an unpowered sailplane. A\nhot-air balloon had been on the roster, but winds at\nMojave precluded its use in this round of tests.\nThe use of radar to detect these aircraft included one\nsurprise - a 1940s vintage fabric-covered Stinson\nVoyager made a larger-than-expected radar signature,\npossibly due ro its large aluminum-covered tail surfaces.\nThe recent tests follow a series last year near Las\nCruces, N.M., in which Ptoteus\' remote pilot, using\ndata from another detection device, was able to avoid\nconflict with aircraft that used transponders to identify\ntheir positions. Researchers are encouraged by the\nresults of both test series, but they say that more work\nis required before a refined operational detect, see and\navoid system can be fielded.\n\nProteus DSA control room in Mojave, Calif.
