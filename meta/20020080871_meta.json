Its advantage in eye screening is speed. Because it requires no response from a subject, it can be used to detect eye problems in very young children. An electronic flash from a 35 millimeter camera sends light into a child's eyes, which is reflected back to the camera lens. The photorefractor then analyzes the retinal reflexes generated and produces an image of the child's eyes, which enables a trained observer to identify any defects. The device is used by pediatricians, day care centers and civic organizations that concentrate on children with special needs.", "title": "Vision Screening", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-20T23:05:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-09-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20020080871, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20020080871, "isbn": "0-16-042100-4", "id": "3d79205e8f00417e9442b31a25373d8c", "publicationName": "Spinoff 1993", "publicationDate": "1993-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20020080871.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20020080871/downloads/20020080871.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20020080871/downloads/20020080871.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20020080871/downloads/20020080871.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
