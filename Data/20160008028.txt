The effort, lead by\nSMDC, was intended to develop a three-stage liquid\nbipropellant (liquid oxygen/liquid methane), pressurefed launch vehicle capable of inserting a payload of at\nleast 25 kg to a 750-km circular orbit. The vehicle design\nwas driven by low cost instead of high performance.\nSWORDS leveraged commercial industry standards to\nutilize standard hardware and technologies over customized unique aerospace designs. SWORDS identified broadly based global industries that have achieved\nadequate levels of quality control and reliability in their\nproducts and then designed around their expertise and\nbusiness motivations.\nThe SMDC effort was primarily funded from the Joint\nCapability Technology Development Program from the\nOffice of the Secretary of Defense.\nNASA provided primarily full-time-equivalent support\nfor various design analysis. These analyses were in areas\nof aerodynamic modeling and database development,\n\n80\n\nModel of SWORDS vehicle and assorted\nground support equipment.\n\nSWORDS engine testing at 75% power level.\n\nAnticipated Benefits\n\nNotable Accomplishments\t\n\nA dedicated nanosatellite launcher can extend the miniature electronics revolution into space by enabling\ncustomers to have a launch-on-demand capability.\nSWORDS was intended to place nanosatellites into\nprecise low-Earth orbits to provide capabilities both\nwhere and when they are needed. Nanosatellites will no\nlonger have to wait months or years for piggyback rides\nsubject to the schedule and orbital locations of other\npayloads. SWORDS would allow the affordable maintenance of constellations of nanosatellites in low-Earth\norbit to provide communications and other services\nat an unprecedented low level of mission command,\nregardless of where customers are located.\n\nThe SWORDS project successfully advanced several\ntechnologies needed to support a possible low cost\nlaunch vehicle, as follows: (1) The design of a multilobed/open-interstage vehicle has lead to increased\nknowledge of flow characteristics using wind tunnel and\nCFD analysis, (2) The advancement of engine modeling and improved test capability resulted in the successful testing of a 60,000-lbf class liquid oxygen (LOX)/\nmethane engine. This is currently the most powerful\nLOX/methane engine to have been tested in the world,\n(3) Analysis of four-engine impingement effects for\nthrust differential controllability, acoustics, and plume\ninteraction has lead to a better understanding of effects\nof using engine throttling for vehicle control, (4) Design\nand testing of a unique engine cross-section (ob-round)\nand asymmetric nozzle increased understanding of the\nefficiency losses of this type of engine design, (5) Use\nof low-cost commercial technology for launch vehicle\navionics showed the viability of use for launch vehicle\napplications, and (6) The launch concept of operations\ndeveloped for a \xe2\x80\x98universal\xe2\x80\x99 small launch system that\ncan be used not only for a SWORDS type vehicle but\nalso for any other small launch vehicle developed in the\nfuture.\n\nPotential Applications\nFor NASA funded missions, SWORDS could provide\na low cost, responsive launch capability for small satellites, for example CubeSats, for many of NASA\xe2\x80\x99s ongoing scientific missions.\nFor other government agencies, e.g., the U.S. Army,\nSWORDS could provide a low cost, responsive launch\ncapability for small satellites to support the soldier in\nthe field, and there are many other uses for other government agencies to place small, low cost satellites into\norbit.\n\nGCD\n81\n\n'
