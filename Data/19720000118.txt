They are issued to encourage\ncommercial application. Tech Briefs are available on a subscription basis from the National Technical Information\nService, Springfield, Virginia 22151. Requests for individual copies or questions relating to the Tech Brief program may\nbe directed to the Technology Utilization Office, NASA, Code KT, Washington, D.C. 20546.\n\nThree-Point Compound Sine Plate offers Cost and Weight Savings\nCurrent methods for rotation of calculated angles\ninvolve the use of a double hinged compound sine plate\nor sine bar and plate. These are heavy and bulky. The\nthree-point sine plate is lightweight, weighing approximately 4 pounds as compared to 65 pounds for a\ncomparable double hinged plate. The three-point sine\nplate is very compact.\nThe new fixture reduces set-up time through use\nof the same mathematical formulas for both right-hand\nand left-hand parts. The complexity of the relationships\nis less than that of current methods.\nThe time, weight and space savings add up to cost\nsavings for designers and manufacturers of machine tools\nand measuring equipment.\nNote:\nRequests for further information may be directed\n4\t\nB\t\nHI\nH2\t\n\nGiven Angle\t\nGiven Angle\t\nHeight of Lift\t\n\nHI\t\n\nU\n\nto:\n\nX\nly 2 + I\n\nTechnology Utilization Officer\nManned Spacecraft Center, Code JM7\nHouston, Texas 77058\nReference: TSP72-101 18\n\nH2 L(Sin B Cos 4)\n\nNote : HI 8 H2 Interchangeable for\nRight or Left Hand Parts\n\nPatent status:\nNo patent action is contemplated by NASA.\n\t\n\nA new work piece adjustment fixture reduces the\n\t\nsize, weight and set-up complexity of alignment platforms used in metal blank machining. The fixture is a \t\n\t\nsine plate aligning surface supported by a three-ball\nsuspension unit.\t\n\nSource: Alfred P.
