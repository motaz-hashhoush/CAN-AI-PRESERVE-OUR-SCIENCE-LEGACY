An electronic control\nmodule has been de3irned and is being con3tructed and will be installed\ninto the system early next month. The while aerial tower used to support the field spectroradiometer is being overhauled and should be delivered in time for the Ribevre Island mission. Two of the graduate\nstudent staff nocassary to c.arrq out the project have been hired, and\nposition offers have been mAdt- to several other students. Preliminary\nwork on reformatting of Skylab tapes and of the field spectroradiometer\n\ntapes has been initiated. Preliminary arrar\xe2\x96\xba v-nx-nts for digitizing of\nthe multi-spectral photography both from the cNaoecraft and supporting\naircraft had been made with Pead Technology Corporation. Sample photographs have been cent to Mead Tech n ology Corporation in order to obtain\nsample digital tapes of the digitizl\xc2\xb1d photography. After these test\ntapes are received, reformatting procedures will be developed in order to\nintegrate photographic and multispectral digital data.\n\n(3) Scientific Rmccmmendations\nIt is highly desirable that data 1, e ac q uired at sun angles in\nexcess of 45 0 in order that the maxim= benefit be obtained from the\nS191 experiment. The MRD calls for 30 0 sun angles, and although the\ndata can be reduced, i f data is acquired under such sun angle conditions,\nsome of the results of \xe2\x80\xa2 :he experiment .clad be compromised.\n\n7. b \'^\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nI\n\nMr. Roper Dicks\nJune 21, 1973\n\nPape 2\n(C) EMec ted\n\nAccor mlish xMnt s\n\nPu rin p the Ne xt Pr.nortinp Period\nA_\n\nThe field spectroradier^eter system should Le in complete operational\n\nArran gements will be complete\nwith the Ribevre Island test site authorities, and the various lopistical\nmatters necessar y to support the fiell ir.ntrunentaticn s y stom will Le accomplished in time for tho propose,i FPF\'P overp\t\nThe field spectroradiometer data that is acquired during the I\'PI:P overnass should Le reduced by\nthe end of the May roportinp period, and appronriatf surface observation\nstatus durinp the next report inp period.\n\nnecessary for training the LAP\'YS rlassifier Will he obtained in the vicinity\n\nof the Ribeyre Island test site and alone trac!< 15 soon after the r.Rr.P\no ve rp a, s .\n(D)\n\nPenults\n\nVince this rcportin;? period is concerned with a pre-launch preparation phase, no nipnificant result , ; as such are reported.\n\n(i) Travel f:umm.iry and Plans\nNo travel was Lmdertaken d , : inp the a_nth of Anril on behalf of this\ncontract, but site visits are r --enr.ed durinp tt,e month of ^\'a y .
