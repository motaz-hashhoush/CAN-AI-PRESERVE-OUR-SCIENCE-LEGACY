It i s characterized by shaft forward circular precession\nat subsynchronous frequency. Control of the flow pattern in the bearing/seal clearance may enhance the stability.\n\nOBJECTIVE\nThe rotor system demonstrates the dynamic effect of perturbation of the flow pattern\nin a seal gap by blowing compressed air in the rotor tangential direction. This\neffect results in shifting the rotor threshold of stability to a higher value of rotative speed when the air jet direction opposes rotation, and to a lower value of\nrotative speed when the air jet direction coincides with rotation. This effect implies that an unstable rotor can be stabilized by blowing air in the direction op)\nposite to rotation. This technique is known as anti-swirl (Figure 2.\nROTOR SYSTEM CONFIGURATION\nThe system consists of a slender shaft, rigidly supported, carrying a mid-span disk.\nThe stator models a seal with 10 mils radial clearance and 5.4 x lom3 clearance-to)\nradius ratio (Figure 3.\n\nIN MOTION\nDUE TO SHAFT ROTATION\nA63\n\nSOURCE OF INSTABILITY!\nFigure 1.\n\n- Bearinglseal fluid-generated instabiijty.\n\n423\n\n0\n\n0\n\nA I R FO I N THE DIRECTION OF SHAFT ROTATION CAUSES DESTABILW\nLIZING E F C .\nFE T\n\nA I R FO AGAINST THE DIRECTION OF SHAFT ROTATION CAUSES STALW\nBILIZING EFFECT (BREAKS THE ROTATION-INOUCEO FO PATTERN).\nLW\n\n-\n\nFigure 2.\nAnti-swirling technique (in setup, i t i s much easier t o c'hange rotation direction than to\nreverse a i r jets for demonstration of anti-swirling effect).\n\nFigure 3.\n\n- Anti-swirling\n\ndemonstration rig.\n\nFour a i r j e t s w i t h on/off valves are located tangentially t o the d i s k (Figure 2).\nRotative speed of the driving motor i s variable i n the range 0 t o 12,000 rpm.
