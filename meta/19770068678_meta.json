Public sector investments are evaluated, noting procedures for determining whether benefits exceed costs. The role of the public sector research and development planning is described, considering the procedure for private sector implementation decisions and a methodology for evaluating the possibility of private sector commercialization. The economic value of the public sector research and development program is presented with attention given to a specific case of NASA-sponsored research and development aimed toward the commercialization of new public communications services.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"country": "Czechoslovakia", "submissionId": 19770068678, "endDate": "1977-10-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "International Astronautical Federation"}}, "meetingId": "24e1e2b168ad4ef9aa6c0900deabef38", "id": "ff3a706be8414d7e8790290f85632b0c"}], "name": "International Astronautical Congress", "location": "Prague", "id": "24e1e2b168ad4ef9aa6c0900deabef38"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 19770068678, "id": "0a9e02ec105b4ff1b4c074b39239d508", "publicationDate": "1977-09-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
