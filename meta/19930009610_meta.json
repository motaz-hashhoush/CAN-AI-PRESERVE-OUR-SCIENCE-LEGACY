The mare-highlands interface is crucial to this endeavor, but the Light Mantle avalanche and presence of fine-grained pyroclastics offer additional constraints. Compositional variation among soils from different locations and depths provides a means to quantify the extent of mixing by larger impacts. Because of their variety and complex history, Apollo 17 soils have been important in establishing agglutinate abundance, mean grain size, and abundance of fine-grained iron metal (as measured by (I(sub s)/FeO)) as simple index of maturity (relative extent of reworking by micrometeorite impact at the surface). The following topics are discussed: (1) surface soils; (2) cores taken on the mission; (3) gray soil from station 4; (4) components with unknown sources; (5) important points; and (6) future work.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19930009610, "id": "ede70c1f057c4f9daea040f450a40149", "publicationName": "Lunar Science Inst., Workshop on Geology of the Apollo 17 Landing Site", "publicationDate": "1992-12-02T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 19930009597, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "Workshop on Geology of the Apollo 17 Landing Site", "stiType": "CONTRACTOR_REPORT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19930009610.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19930009610/downloads/19930009610.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19930009610/downloads/19930009610.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19930009610/downloads/19930009610.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
