Mission Directorate\nHung D. Nguyen and Gynelle C. Steele\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration\nGlenn Research Center\nCleveland, Ohio 44135\n\nAbstract\nThis report is intended to help NASA program and project managers incorporate Small Business\nInnovation Research/Small Business Technology Transfer (SBIR/STTR) technologies that have gone\nthrough Phase II of the SBIR program into NASA Science Mission Directorate (SMD) programs. Other\nGovernment and commercial project managers can also find this information useful.\n\nIntroduction\nIncorporating Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)-developed technology into NASA\nprograms is important, especially given the Agency\xe2\x80\x99s limited resources for technology development. The\nSBIR program\xe2\x80\x99s original intention was for technologies that completed Phase II to be ready for\nintegration into NASA programs, however, in many cases there is a gap between Technology Readiness\nLevels (TRLs) 5 and 6 that needs to be closed.\nAfter Phase II projects are completed, the technology is evaluated against various parameters and a\nTRL rating is assigned. Most programs tend to adopt more mature technologies\xe2\x80\x94at least TRL 6 to reduce\nthe risk to the mission rather than adopt TRLs between 3 and 5 because those technologies perceived as\ntoo risky. The gap between TRLs 5 and 6 is often called the \xe2\x80\x9cValley of Death\xe2\x80\x9d (Fig. 1) and historically it\nhas been difficult to close because of a lack of funding support from programs. Several papers already\nhave suggested remedies on how to close the gaps (Refs. 1 to 4).\nTo address the TRL gap, NASA\xe2\x80\x99s SBIR program has made a considerable effort to strengthen the\ncritical connection between SBIR and NASA programs through post-Phase II initiatives. As a result\nNASA SBIR now supports its small business partners with three post-Phase II options that focus on\ncreating opportunities for technology infusion and commercialization. The Phase II Enhancement (Phase\nII-E), Phase II Expanded (Phase II-X), and the Commercialization Readiness Program (CRP) options\nprovide opportunities for Phase II technologies to be integrated and tested in the NASA system platform\nor in the space environment.\n\nAligning SBIR Technologies Into SMD Programs\nThis section discusses how NASA program managers can incorporate SBIR technologies into Science\nMission Directorate (SMD) programs by showing where there is relevant alignment. This information\nalso will be helpful for other Government agencies or commercial entities that pursue related fields.\n\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942015-218856\n\n1\n\nSMD research focuses on conducting scientific exploration enabled by the use of space observatories\nand space probes that view the Earth from space, observe and visit other bodies in the solar system, and\npeer out into our Galaxy and beyond. SMD is structured into the following four operations:\n(1) Earth Science: Develops a scientific understanding of the Earth system and its response to natural and\nhuman-induced changes to enable improved prediction of climate, weather, and natural hazards for\npresent and future generations.\n(2) Planetary Science: Advances the scientific understanding of the solar system in extraordinary ways,\nwhile pushing the limits of spacecraft and robotic engineering design and operations.\n(3) Astrophysics: Discovers how the universe works, explore how it began and evolved, and search for\nlife on planets around other stars.\n(4) Heliophysics: Explores the full system of complex interactions that characterize the relationship of\nthe Sun with the solar system.\nFigure 2 shows the SMD operations structure and programs that focus on exploring the solar system\nfor scientific purposes while supporting safe robotic and human exploration of space, and programs that\nfocus on improving national capabilities to predict climate, weather, and natural hazards; manage\nresources; and supporting the development of environmental policy.

This addresses complex, interdisciplinary Earth science problems in\npursuit of a comprehensive understanding of the Earth system. This strategy involves six\ninterdisciplinary and interrelated science focus areas, including (1) Climate variability and\nchange, (2) Atmospheric composition, (3) Carbon cycle and ecosystems, (4) Water and energy\ncycle, (5) Weather, and (6) Earth surface and interior.\nEarth Systematic Missions: Focus on a broad range of multi-disciplinary science investigations\naimed at understanding the Earth system and its response to natural and human induced forces\nand changes. Develops Earth-observing research satellite missions, manages the operation of\nthese missions once on orbit, and produces mission data products in support of research,\napplications, and policy communities.\nEarth System Science Pathfinder: The Earth System Science Pathfinder (ESSP) program provides\nan innovative approach to Earth science research by providing frequent, regular, competitively\nselected opportunities that accommodate new and emerging scientific priorities and measurement\ncapabilities. ESSP projects include space missions and remote sensing instruments for spacebased missions of opportunity or extended duration airborne science missions. The ESSP\nprogram also supports the conduct of science research utilizing data from these missions.\nEarth Science Multi-Mission: Acquires, preserves, and distributes observational data from\noperating spacecraft to support Earth Science research focus areas. This is accomplished\nprimarily by the Earth Observing System Data and Information System (EOSDIS), which has\nbeen in operations since 1994. EOSDIS acquires, processes, archives, and distributes Earth\nScience data and information products.\nEarth Science Technology: Enables previously infeasible science investigations; improves\nexisting measurement capabilities; and reduces the cost, risk, and/or development times for Earth\nscience instruments. EST will develop new remote-sensing and information systems technologies\nfor infusion into future science missions and airborne campaigns. These technologies will enable\nor enhance measurements and data system capabilities.\nApplied Sciences: Leverages NASA Earth Science satellite measurements and new scientific\nknowledge to provide innovative and practical uses for public and private sector organizations. It\nalso enables near-term uses of Earth science knowledge, discovers and demonstrates new\napplications, and facilitates adoption of applications by non-NASA stakeholder organizations.\n\nPlanetary Science Operations\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nPlanetary Science Research: Provides the scientific foundation for unique data sets returned from\nNASA missions exploring the solar system. Focuses on five key research goals: Explore and\nobserve the objects in the solar system to understand how they formed and evolve; Advance the\nunderstanding of how the chemical and physical processes in our solar system operate, interact,\nand evolve; Explore and find locations where life could have existed or could exist today;\nImprove our understanding of the origin and evolution of life on Earth to guide our search for life\nelsewhere; Identify and characterize objects in the solar system that pose threats to Earth or offer\nresources for human exploration.\n\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942015-218856\n\n4\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nDiscovery: Supports innovative, relatively low-cost, competitively selected Planetary Science\nmissions. The Discovery program currently has two operational spacecraft: MErcury Surface,\nSpaceENvironment, GEochemistry, and Ranging (MESSENGER) and Dawn. The program also\nhas one instrument in operations: the Analyzer of Space Plasma and Energetic Atoms (ASPERA3) on the ESA Mars Express mission; one flight mission in development: the Interior Exploration\nusing Seismic Investigations, Geodesy and Heat Transport (InSight); and one instrument in\nspacecraft integration: Strofio on the ESA BepiColombo mission to Mercury.\nNew Frontiers: Seeks to contain total mission cost and development time and improve\nperformance through the use of validated new technologies, efficient management, and control of\ndesign, development and operations costs while maintaining a strong commitment to flight safety.\nThe program objective is to launch high-science-return planetary science investigations twice per\ndecade.\nMars Exploration: Seeks to understand whether Mars was, is, or can be, a habitable world and\nwhether it ever supported life. The four broad, overarching goals for Mars Exploration are to\ndetermine whether life ever arose on Mars; characterize the climate of Mars; characterize the\ngeology of Mars; and prepare for human exploration.\nOuter Planets: Enables science investigations spanning the diverse geography and disciplines of\nthe outer solar system. The strategic missions in this portfolio investigate a broad array of science\ndisciplines with more depth than is possible for smaller, tightly focused missions in the Discovery\nand New Frontiers programs. The science discoveries made by these strategic missions provide\nanswers to long-held questions and theories about life beyond Earth and the origin and evolution\nof outer planets.\nTechnology: Supports multimission capabilities and technology developments in key spacecraft\nsystems, and mission operations. Additionally, it includes the Radioisotope Power Systems\n(RPS), Plutonium Production, RPS Production Operations infrastructure and Advanced MultiMission Operations System (AMMOS) projects.\n\nAstrophysics Operations\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nAstrophysics Research: Analyzes the data from NASA missions to understand astronomical\nevents such as the explosion of a star, the birth of a distant galaxy, or the nature of planets\ncircling other stars. The program also enables the early development of new technologies for\nfuture missions, and suborbital flights of experimental payloads on balloons and sounding\nrockets.\nCosmic Origins: Supports a number of operating facilities includes Hubble Space Telescope\n(HST), Spitzer Space Telescope (SST), and the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy\n(SOFIA). Focus on advanced future instruments for SOFIA and studies of a UV-optical successor\nto HST. Advances in key technologies will enable the building of powerful future facilities.\nPhysics of the Cosmos: Incorporates cosmology, high energy astrophysics, and fundamental\nphysics projects that address central questions about the nature of complex astrophysical\nphenomena such as black holes, neutron stars, dark matter and dark energy, cosmic microwave\nbackground, and gravitational waves.\nExoplanet Exploration: Focuses on advancing along a path of discovery leading to a point where\nscientists can directly study the atmospheres and surface features of habitable, rocky planets, like\nEarth, around other stars in the solar neighborhood. It also develops systems that will allow\n\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942015-218856\n\n5\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nscientists to take the pivotal step from identifying an exoplanet as Earth-sized, to determining\nwhether it is truly Earth-like, and possibly even detecting if it bears the fingerprints of life.\nAstrophysics Explorer: Provides frequent flight opportunities for world-class astrophysics\ninvestigations using innovative and streamlined management approaches for spacecraft\ndevelopment and operations. The program is highly responsive to new knowledge, new\ntechnology, and updated scientific priorities by launching smaller missions that can be conceived\nand executed in a relatively short development cycle.\n\nHeliophysics Operations\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nHeliophysics Research: To understand the Sun, heliosphere, and planetary environments as a\nsingle connected system and to answer these fundamental questions about this system\xe2\x80\x99s behavior.\nIt also advances knowledge of solar processes and the interaction of solar plasma and radiation\nwith Earth, the other planets and the Galaxy.\nLiving with a Star: Targets specific aspects of the Sun-Earth-planetary system that affect life and\nsociety. LWS provides a predictive understanding of the Sun-Earth system, the linkages among\nthe interconnected systems, and specifically of the space weather conditions at Earth and the\ninterplanetary medium. LWS products measure and therefore may mitigate impacts to technology\nassociated with space systems, communications and navigation, and ground systems such as\npower grids.\nSolar Terrestrial Probes: Focuses on understanding the fundamental physics of the space\nenvironment, from the Sun to Earth, other planets, and beyond to the interstellar medium. STP\nprovides insight into the fundamental processes of plasmas (fluid of charged particles) inherent in\nall astrophysical systems. STP missions focus on processes such as the variability of the Sun, the\nresponses of the planets to those variations, and the interaction of the Sun and solar system.\nHeliophysics Explorers: Provides frequent flight opportunities for world-class scientific\ninvestigations on focused and timely science topics. Explorers use a suite of smaller, fully\ncompeted missions that address these topics to complement the science of strategic missions of\nthe Living with a Star and Solar Terrestrial Probes (STP) programs.\n\nFiscal Year 2015 Topics and Subtopics Related to SMD\nThe annual NASA-wide SBIR solicitation is divided up into several topics and subtopics; Figure 4(a)\nand (b) illustrate those topics and subtopics for the FY 2015 solicitation. These SBIR topics and subtopics\nare carefully developed to strategically align with SMD programs, thereby supporting the directorate\xe2\x80\x99s\ncurrent needs and objectives.\nThe annual NASA-wide SBIR solicitation contains several topics and subtopics that are developed to\nstrategically align with SMD programs, thereby supporting the directorate\xe2\x80\x99s current needs and objectives.\nTo help the small business principal investigators (PIs) and SMD program managers, it is important to\nunderstand how the SBIR topics and subtopics are mapped to SMD programs. Figure 3 shows the\nFY 2015 solicitation topics and subtopics for SMD programs and Figure 4 maps the FY 2015 solicitation\nsubtopics to SMD programs.\n\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942015-218856\n\n6\n\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942015-218856\n\n7\n\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942015-218856\n\n8\n\nSummary of SBIR Topics and Subtopics for SMD\nTopic S1 Sensors, Detectors, and Instruments\nS1.01 Lidar Remote Sensing Technologies\nFocus on new capabilities or enhancements over current measurements of atmospheric and\ntopographic parameters from ground, airborne, and space-based platforms. Innovative lidar subsystem\nand component technologies that directly address the measurement of atmospheric constituents and\nsurface topography of the Earth, Mars, the Moon, and other planetary bodies will be considered under this\nsubtopic. Compact, high-efficiency lidar instruments for deployment on unconventional platforms, such\nas balloon, small sat, and CubeSat are also considered.\nS1.02 Microwave Technologies for Remote Sensing\nFocus on active (radar) and passive (radiometer) microwave sensors for a wide range of remote\nsensing applications. These sensors include low frequency (less than 10 MHz) sounders to G-band (160\nGHz) radars for measuring precipitation and clouds, for planetary landing, upper atmospheric monitoring,\nand global snow coverage, topography measurement and other Earth and planetary science applications.\nS1.03 Sensor and Detector Technology for Visible, IR, Far IR, and Submillimeter\nFocus on new technologies or improvements to existing technologies to meet the detector needs of\nfuture missions, as described in the most recent decadal surveys for Earth science. These detectors include\ndevelopment of un-cooled or cooled infrared detectors and development of a robust wafer-level\nintegration technology that will allow high-frequency capable interconnects and allow two dis-similar\nsubstrates.\nS1.04 Detector Technologies for UV, X-Ray, Gamma-Ray, and Cosmic-Ray Instruments\nFocus on detector requirements for a broad range of wavelengths from UV through to gamma ray for\napplications in Astrophysics, Earth Science, Heliophysics, and Planetary Science. Requirements across\nthe board are for greater numbers of readout pixels, lower power, faster readout rates, greater quantum\nefficiency, and enhanced energy resolution.\nS1.05 Particles and Field Sensors and Instrument Enabling Technologies\nFocus on advanced sensors for the detection of elementary particles (atoms, molecules and their ions)\nand electric and magnetic fields in space and associated instrument technologies. Improvements in\nparticles and fields sensors and associated instrument technologies enable further scientific advancement\nfor upcoming NASA missions such as CubeSats, Explorers, and planetary exploration missions.\nTechnology developments that result in a reduction in size, mass, power, and cost will enable these\nmissions to proceed. Of interest are advanced magnetometers, electric field booms, ion/atom/molecule\ndetectors, and associated support electronics and materials.\nS1.06 In-Situ Sensors and Sensor Systems for Lunar and Planetary Science\nDevelopment of advanced instrument technologies and components suitable for deployment on\nplanetary and lunar missions. These technologies must be capable of withstanding operation in space and\n\nNASA/TM\xe2\x80\x942015-218856\n\n9\n\nplanetary environments, including the expected pressures, radiation levels, launch and impact stresses,\nand range of survival and operational temperatures. Technologies that reduce mass, power, volume, and\ndata rates for instruments and instrument components without loss of scientific capability are of particular\nimportance.\nS1.07 Airborne Measurement Systems\nMeasurement system miniaturization and/or increased performance is needed to support for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s\nairborne science missions, particularly those utilizing the Global Hawk, SIERRA-class, Dragon Eye or\nother unmanned aircraft. The subject airborne instruments are intended as calibration/validation systems.\nComplete instrument systems are desired, including features such as remote/unattended operation and\ndata acquisition, low power consumption, and minimum size and weight. Desired sensors include\nminiaturized, high performance instrument suites for multidisciplinary applications.\nS1.08 Surface and Sub-surface Measurement Systems\nSurface & Sub-surface Measurement Systems are sought with relevance to future space missions such\nas Active Sensing of CO2 Emissions over Nights, Days, and Seasons (ASCENDS), Orbiting Carbon\nObservatory - 2 (OCO-2), Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM), Geostationary Coastal and Air\nPollution Events (GEO-CAPE), Hyperspectral InfraRed Imager (HyspIRI), Aerosol, Cloud, and\nEcosystems (ACE, including Pre-ACE/PACE). Sensor system innovations with significant near-term\ncommercial potential that may be suitable for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s research after full development are of interest.\nS1.09 Atomic Interferometry\nRecent developments of laser control and manipulation of atoms have led to new types of precision\ninertial force and gravity sensors based on atom interferometry. Atom interferometers exploit the quantum\nmechanical wave nature of atomic particles and quantum gases for sensitive interferometric\nmeasurements. Ground-based laboratory experiments and instruments have already demonstrated beyond\nthe state of the art performances of accelerometer, gyroscope, and gravity measurements. Currently the\nmost mature development of atom interferometers as measurement instruments are those based on light\npulsed atom interferometers with freefall cold atoms.
