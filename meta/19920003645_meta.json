Models of collisional evolution of the asteroid belt suggest that many of the larger asteroids are shattered rubble piles, consisting of fragments bound together by gravity. If these assemblages are sufficiently weak, they should relax to equilibrium shapes that depend only on their spin periods and densities. Thus, if shape of an asteroid is known, one might infer its density and internal structure.", "title": "Planetary astronomy", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T16:56:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19920003645, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Chapman, C.
