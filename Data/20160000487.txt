A. Heiskanen,\r\n'The Latest Achievements of Physical Geodesy' \r\n\n0\nV*\n\nJOHN\n\nA. O'KEEFE\n\nTheoretical Division, Goddard Space Flight Center \r\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration\r\nWashington, D. C.\n\nIn his recent report on physical geodesy,\nIleiskanen [1960] replied to a criticism by\nO'Keefe [1959]. He wrote, 'O'Keefe has assumed that the flattening value of 1:299.8 cor-\n\nresponds to the hydrostatic equilibrium, and he\nuses this flattening value when he computes the\nspherical harmonics of the gravity anomalies\nand the undulations N of the geoid. Because the\nhydrostatic equilibrium is not complete, one\ncannot use this value, and Figure 2, page 2931,\nof O' Kee fe's [1959] publication will not explain anything.'\nIn view of objections raised by Professor\nHeiskanen, it appears necessary to state more\nfully the reasoning leading to the adoption of\nthe value 1/299.8 for the flattening of the reference ellipsoid. The underlying idea is to use as\nreference the figure that the earth would assume\nif it were in a state of fluid equilibrium. The\nadvantage of this figure is that the stresses in\nthe interior of the earth can be expected to be\nproportional to the amplitude of harmonics in\nthe gravitational field that measure deviations\nfrom this ellipsoid. For this reason, namely, the\ninterest to the geophysicist concerned, with the\nstructure of the earth, we have stressed the importance of the figure of fluid equilibrium.\nThere is, in addition, significance for geodesy\nin the disclosure that the geoid differs systematically and extensively from the figure of fluid\nequilibrium. These differences contradict the\nprinciple formulated by Heiskanen and Vening\nMeinesz [1958] as the basic hypothesis of geodesy, namely, that deviations from the ellipsoid\nof fluid equilibrium would be found to be small.\nThe actual deviations have been found to be\nbetween 5 and 30 times those anticipated. For\nthis reason a firm adherence to the ellipsoid of\nfluid equilibrium as the reference for calculations of anomalies is useful to the geodesist by\nkeeping before his eyes the real size of the\n\ndeviations which may exist in those parts of the\nworld that he cannot measure.\nThe value 1/299.8 is based on a slight modification of the work of Henriksen [1960]. Henriksen's argument is summarized by the block\ndiagram, Figure 1 [O'Keefe, Roman, Yaplee,\nand Eckels, 1959], which presents the relations\n\namong the physical constants related to the\nflattening of the earth. From the precession of\nthe equinoxes, the value H = 3.274 x 10' is\nderived for the quantity (C - A)/C. On the\nother hand, from observations of satellites the\nvalue J2 = 1.0825 x 10 is found for the quantity (C - A )/M&, whence C/Md' = 3.306 [cf.\nCook, 1959]. The point of Henriksen's paper is\nthat the hydrostatic value of the flattening appropriate to a given configuration of the earth\ncan be directly calculated from this quantity\nC/Ma'. That this is so is directly evident from\nthe first-order equations of Jeffreys [1952], especially equation 47, from which we can determine\nthe quantity 77, and equation 50, which relates\nto the flattening. These equations constitute\nthe heart of the problem. However, a slightly\nmore refined treatment can be made either by\nthe equation of de Sitter [1924] which Henriksen used or by the equations given by Jones\n[1954]. The numerical result is 1/299.8.\nBy way of comparison, the method used before the advent of the satellites for this purpose\n\nFig. 1. Relationship or quantities involved in the\r\nflattening of the earth.\n\n1992\n\nLETTERS TO THE EDITOR\nwas somewhat roundabout. Lacking an accurate\ndetermination of (C - A)/M&, the assumption\nwas made that this quantity had precisely the\nvalue that it would have in the case of fluid\nequilibrium. This equation, together with the\ncondition arising from the moon's precession,\nwas sufficient to determine the value of the flattening; and in this way the old hydrostatic\nvalue of 1/297.3 was found [Jeffreys, 1952].\nSince we now know that the earth is not in\nhydrostatic equilibrium, it is clearly no longer\nlegitimate to calculate in this way.\nIt may be asked whether we can assume that\nthe value of C which we obtained from the observations is identical with the value which the\nearth would have if it should go to hydrostatic\nequilibrium. The answer is that this is in all\nprobability true to four significant figures. A\nchange of C or A by one part in 100,000 is\nenough to change (C - A)/M& in the third\nsignificant figure. Thus the earth can change its\nflattening to agree with the requirements of hydrostatic equilibrium without seriously altering\nits moment of inertia. It is these considerations\nthat justify the flattening of 1/299.8. It will be\nseen that they take into account fully the fact\nthat hydrostatic equilibrium is not complete.\nHeiskanen further asserts that he has 'not\nclaimed that complete hydrostatic equilibrium\nprevails.' On this point there is considerable\nagreement. It seems to me, however, that the\n\n\t\n\n1993\n\nnew numerical data mean that in estimating the\ncontributions of the unexplored portions of the\nearth's gravitational field one should assume\nnonhydrostatic contributions in accordance with\nthose found from satellites, i.e., approximately\n10 times the contributions assumed by Heiskanen and Vening Meinesz [1958] in their formulation of the basic hypothesis of geodesy.\nREFERENCES\n\nCook, A.
