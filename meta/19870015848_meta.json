Particular disagreement exists on how turbulence levels will vary with qualitative analysis. It does not tie one down to specifics. When it comes to flying quality specifications, many feel that one should stay with the definitions of the Cooper-Harper rating scale but allow the levels to shift depending on the level of turbulence. There is a ride quality specification in the MIL-SPEC having to do with flight control systems design that is related to a turbulence model. This spec (MIL-F8785C) and others are discussed.", "title": "Military specifications", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-05T11:08:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19870015848, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Reynolds, Philip"}, "organization": {"name": "Calspan Corp.", "location": "Buffalo, NY, United States"}}, "id": "3f6ec3ecbb8a46ec9dd8428f92c6e78b"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19870015848, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19870015848, "id": "291c9e2fcc784c10ba7e57401f8fffa9", "publicationName": "NASA.
