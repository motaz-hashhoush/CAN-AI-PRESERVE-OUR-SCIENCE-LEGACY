b'Custom 3D Printers Revolutionize Space Supply Chain\nNASA Technology\n\nL\n\nike a desert caravan, a space flight crew has to\nbring with it everything it will need over the\ncourse of its journey into an utterly barren environment. This has always meant allotting room for every\ngyroscope or astrolabe, every LED housing or oil lamp. In\nspace travel, not only is payload capacity at a premium,\nbut these objects also must be made to withstand the\ng-force and jarring vibrations of liftoff.\nAll of that is about to change.\nIn January of 2015, aboard the International Space\nStation (ISS), Made In Space Inc. and NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Marshall\nSpace Flight Center plan to carry out the first additive\nmanufacturing technology demonstration performed in\nspace, using a customized 3D printer that the company\ndeveloped over the previous three years with NASA support through the Small Business Innovation Research\n(SBIR) program.\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo one\xe2\x80\x99s ever done this before, where supplies\nare actually created in space,\xe2\x80\x9d says Niki Werkheiser,\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s project manager for the 3D Printing in Zero-G\nTechnology Demonstration.\n\xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99ve got to imagine how cool this is,\xe2\x80\x9d she says,\nnoting that the biggest constraint on a space mission\xe2\x80\x99s\ndistance and duration is the limit to what can be carried and the lack of a supply chain, making in-space\nmanufacturing a necessity for any manned, interplanetary\nexploration. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re using the space station as a test bed\nto test the technology we know we\xe2\x80\x99ll need on exploration\nmissions. We\xe2\x80\x99ll absolutely need this.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThat was just what the founders of Made In Space,\nlocated at Ames Research Center in Moffett Field,\nCalifornia, had in mind when they started the company in\n2010 after meeting at Singularity University, also located\nat Ames, says Made In Space spokesman Grant Lowery.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe saw the supply chain as the biggest problem facing\nspace travelers,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cWith the rise of the commercial\nspace industry, there\xe2\x80\x99s going to be a growing demand for\n\n134\t Industrial Productivity\t\n\nMade In Space Chief Strategy Officer Mike Chen, left,\nand Chief Technology Officer Jason Dunn test the\ncompany\xe2\x80\x99s prototype for a space-ready 3D printer in\nsimulated microgravity aboard Zero G Corporation\xe2\x80\x99s\nmodified Boeing 727 in 2013.\n\nSpinoff 2015\n\nIn the Made In Space \xe2\x80\x9cclean room,\xe2\x80\x9d Chief Technology Officer Jason Dunn pulls a sample part from the company\xe2\x80\x99s prototype for a 3D\nprinter that can operate in microgravity, as lead engineer and director of research and development Michael Snyder looks on.\n\nthe ability to manufacture out there. We think it will save\ntime, money, and logistical difficulty.\xe2\x80\x9d\nIn 2011, through NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Flight Opportunities\nProgram, the company tested several existing 3D printers\nin simulated microgravity aboard Zero-G Corporation\xe2\x80\x99s\nmodified Boeing 727 and found them to be ill-suited to a\nweightless environment.\n\xe2\x80\x9cEverything on Earth is built with gravity assumed,\xe2\x80\x9d\nLowery says, explaining that the machines\xe2\x80\x99 builders\ntook for granted that certain parts would rest on others,\nfor example.\nFunded by an SBIR contract through Marshall, the\nMade In Space engineers set about building a model that\nwas gravity-independent. It also had to be ruggedized to\nsurvive liftoff, and the builders couldn\xe2\x80\x99t allow for any offSpinoff 2015\t\n\ngassing that would contaminate a hermetic atmosphere\nsuch as that found onboard the ISS. Machinery for use\nin space also has to take into account a lack of natural\nconvection due to the lack of gravity, meaning air has to\nbe forced to circulate.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThose are some of the areas where NASA was able to\nprovide some insight,\xe2\x80\x9d Werkheiser says.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve benefitted from the partnership, and they\xe2\x80\x99ve\nbeen wonderful in offering their expertise,\xe2\x80\x9d Lowery says\nof the NASA team the company has worked with.\n\nTechnology Transfer\nIn early 2013, Made In Space was awarded a Phase II\nSBIR to develop a commercial model to be permanently\ninstalled aboard the ISS, as well as a separate Phase III\nIndustrial Productivity\t 135\n\ncontract to build the prototype that was tested aboard\nthe space station in 2014. The prototype was first tested\naboard Zero G\xe2\x80\x99s plane, which flies in parabolic arcs to\ncreate intervals of weightlessness, but these periods were\ntoo short to adequately prove the printer\xe2\x80\x99s effectiveness in\nconsistent microgravity.\nThat problem is being addressed by flying the\nprototype, about the size of a small microwave, to the ISS\nfor a demonstration in space. There, it will create more\nthan 30 objects, including calibration coupons and tools\nsuch as a crowfoot wrench. Most will be based on files\nloaded on the machine before launch, but others will be\nuploaded to the printer from Earth while it is in orbit.\nNASA has already identified a list of tools, parts, and\nother objects that are commonly lost or broken on the\nspace station, including structural items, torque tools,\ncontainers, clips, and many others, from the crucial and\ncomplicated to the mundane. Lowery says crewmembers\ntold the company one simple set of objects often in\ndemand aboard the station is silverware.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe crew gets really excited about this,\xe2\x80\x9d Werkheiser\nsays, noting that astronauts often have to wait months for\nsimple parts that could be printed in a matter of minutes.\nLowery says a NASA study estimated the device would\nbe able to print about 30 percent of the small parts and\ntools aboard the space station, and Werkheiser noted that\neven large items could be designed as a set of smaller parts\nthat fit together.\nThe prototype prints objects from acrylonitrile\nbutadiene styrene plastic, the same material that standard\nLEGO blocks are made of. Its successor, which will\nbe slightly larger, will print with a variety of materials,\nand Werkheiser says NASA would eventually like\na machine that can print metal parts. She says the team\nis also working on the capability to convert printed\nproducts back into the feedstock, essentially recycling the\nprinter\xe2\x80\x99s output.\nLowery points out that with a 3D printer, the Apollo\n13 crew could have easily recreated the carbon dioxide\n136\t Industrial Productivity\t\n\nThe prototype for a 3D printer capable of operating in microgravity, created by Made In Space with the help of a couple of Small\nBusiness Innovation Research contracts with NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Marshall Space Flight Center, is slightly smaller than the one the company will\ncreate for installation aboard the International Space Station.\n\nSpinoff 2015\n\nscrubber they needed, rather than adapting an ill-fitted\nscrubber with spacesuit hose and duct tape. \xe2\x80\x9cNow you\ncan actually custom-make the part or piece or tool you\nneed,\xe2\x80\x9d he says.\n\nBenefits\nUnder the agreement for use of the commercial 3D\nprinter on the ISS, Made In Space will own the machine,\nand NASA will be a customer paying to use it. \xe2\x80\x9cWe want\ncommercial companies to make the things we need,\xe2\x80\x9d\nWerkheiser says.\nHowever, she says NASA will be far from the only\ncustomer. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s actually a business in space.\xe2\x80\x9d\nMuch like NanoRacks, the company that built and\nowns 36 modular laboratories aboard the ISS and counts\nNASA and a host of other entities, including universities,\nforeign space agencies, and private companies, among its\npaying customers (Spinoff 2012), Made In Space expects\nbroad appeal to the idea of manufacturing products in\nspace. Indeed, NanoRacks\xe2\x80\x99 chief technology officer has\nbeen an advisor to the Made In Space team, and the final\nprinter will be located with the NanoRacks equipment in\nthe station\xe2\x80\x99s US lab.\nWith the ability to upload design specifications to the\nprinter from Earth, customers \xe2\x80\x9ccan essentially email their\nhardware to space,\xe2\x80\x9d Lowery says.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re just trying to wake people up to the range of\npossibilities that exist because of this capability,\xe2\x80\x9d he says,\nadding that even the company isn\xe2\x80\x99t sure exactly how wide\nthat scope might turn out to be, in terms of commercial\nand research possibilities.\nLowery says Made In Space has already spoken with a\nnumber of companies, universities, government agencies,\nand even artists who are interested in the ability to easily\ncreate objects in space and even launch them into low\norbit from the ISS.\nA major application of the technology, as Lowery sees\nit, will be the creation and deployment of nanosatellites\xe2\x80\x94\nlittle shells around four inches in diameter that can carry\nSpinoff 2015\t\n\nany number of technologies or experiments. \xe2\x80\x9cYou could\nprint the satellite in a matter of hours, slip an electronics\nboard into it, toss it outside the space station, and you\xe2\x80\x99ve\ngot a satellite,\xe2\x80\x9d he says.\nNanoRacks already has a system for nanosatellite\ndeployment from the space station and has flown scores of\nthe little packages into space on various rocket launches.\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s CubeSat Launch Initiative has helped to find\nroom in rocket payloads for nanosatellites being used by\na variety of entities for research and educational purposes.\nThe company\xe2\x80\x99s 3D printer could drastically alter\nthe CubeSat initiative. While the satellites\xe2\x80\x99 cargo often\nwould still have to be physically transported into space,\npayload logistics and size limits would present far fewer\nconstraints.\nWerkheiser notes that nanosatellites are already being\nmade with 3D printing on the ground and are becoming widely used for defense, communications, education,\nresearch, and other applications. \xe2\x80\x9cI really think it\xe2\x80\x99s going\nto be a big business,\xe2\x80\x9d she says.\nShe says the technology will also find uses on Earth,\nand military services have already expressed interest in\na 3D printer capable of micro-precision in its output,\nruggedized to withstand physical hardship, and built to\nmeet the highest safety ratings. A durable, reliable 3D\nprinter would be especially useful in a submarine, in\nthe desert or \xe2\x80\x9canyplace where you\xe2\x80\x99re in a remote area\nand you\xe2\x80\x99re dependent on the parts you have with you,\xe2\x80\x9d\nWerkheiser says.\nShe says this technology, which will make remote areas\nmore habitable on Earth and in space, for astronauts and\nfor others, and this partnership are prime examples of\nwhat can come from cooperation between NASA and the\nbusiness community. \xe2\x80\x9cThe SBIR process has been excellent for leveraging the capabilities of small companies to\nmeet NASA\xe2\x80\x99s objectives, and we can\xe2\x80\x99t wait to see what\ncomes next.\xe2\x80\x9d v\nMade In Space\xe2\x80\x99s prototype for a space-ready 3D printer\nis shown with some of the products the final model might\nproduce aboard the International Space Station.\n\nIndustrial Productivity\t 137\n\n'
