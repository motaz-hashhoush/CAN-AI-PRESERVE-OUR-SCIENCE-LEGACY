The (B - V), (V - R), and (V - J) colors are compiled with those available in the literature to assess the color change of novae as a function of time since outburst. Using available reddening values results in a list of 42 (B - V), 28 (V - R), and 38 (V - J) dereddened colors for novae that are from 1 to 319 years past outburst. The results indicate all the colors cluster about zero, with no obvious transition to red values as would be expected for novae undergoing a hibernation scenario. This indicates the accretion disk is sustained for at least 200 years after outburst. It is also apparent that red novae with giant secondaries and/or unusual properties readily stand out from the normal novae in color.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "publications": [{"volume": "108", "submissionId": 19950028681, "issue": "2", "issn": "0004-6256", "id": "095d270164ad46ba816e6d276c5039d2", "publicationName": "The Astronomical Journal", "publicationDate": "1994-08-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
