If one were to occur nearby, it could wipe out life on Earth. Fortunately, the chances of mass extinction are slimmer than the Chicago Cubs meeting the Boston Red Sox in the World Series (. . . and the Red Sox winning). But a new analysis of over 1400 archived gamma-ray bursts reveals that about 100 bursts originated within 325 million light-years of Earth, and not billions of light-years away as previously thought. If so, there's no reason why a burst couldn't go off in our galaxy.", "title": "The Gamma-Ray Burst Next Door", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-21T13:29:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20040010568, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Wanjek, Christopher"}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Goddard Space Flight Center", "location": "Greenbelt, MD, United States"}}, "id": "37fe04185d4648c2900a4dc70f19c54c"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-09-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20040010568, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20040010568, "id": "8f4598d650874e80a7b1229ae35be7df", "publicationName": "Space Science Reference Guide, 2nd Edition", "publicationDate": "2003-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "id": 20040010556, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "Space Science Reference Guide, 2nd Edition", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
