As our\npopulation\n\nhas grown, we have\n\naltered the landscape to raise crops\nand animals, harvest forests, and build\ncities, roads, canals, and dams.\nLand cover influences local weather\nand climate. Weather and climate,\nin turn, affect land cover, particularly\npatterns of vegetation\n\nand water distri-\n\nbution. The Earth\'s radiation\n\nbudget\n\ndepends partly on absorption and\nreflection from land surfaces, which\ndiffer greatly depending\n\non soil or rock\n\ntype, moisture content, vegetation\n\ntype,\n\nand snow cover. Changes in vegetation\ncover can alter surface wind patterns\nand the exchange of moisture and heat\nwith the air. These land-air interactions\ncan affect local patterns of precipitation,\nwater storage, and runoff that control\nthe amount of water available for use\nin homes, agriculture,\n\nindustry, and\n\nenergy production.\nPatterns of life have changed as land\nis converted from natural to humandominated\n\nconditions.\n\nprocesses engaged\n\nBiological\n\nin the global carbon\n\ncycle have a significant but poorly\nquantified effect on greenhouse gas\naccumulation\n\nin the atmosphere.\n\nThe\n\ngreenhouse gases influenced by biological processes include carbon dioxide\n(CO2), methane, and nitrous oxide. The\nmost significant\n\nprocesses are those\n\nrelated to the storage and release of\ncarbon.\n\nPlants, through\n\ntransform atmospheric\norganic\n\nphotosynthesis,\nCO 2 into\n\nmatter. This process leads to a\n\nsink for CO 2, with carbon stored as\nliving vegetation\n\nor as dead material\n\nin soils. Higher CO 2 concentrations\ncan stimulate plant production\n\nand this\n\ncarbon may end up stored by plants.\n\nLAND COVER AND\nWATER CYCLE\nGlobal Greenness\nVegetation (right):\n1-km AVHRR "greenness\nindex" (increasing from\nbrown-yellow-green, with\nwhite as clouds or snow)\nduring the last week of\nJune 1992.\nLand Use and Hydrology\n(below): St. Louis and\nsurrounding farmland\nat the confluence of the\nMississippi River (upper\nleft) and the Missouri River\n(center) at the peak of\nmajor floods in July 1993.\nHowever, some land use changes may\nrelease this stored carbon into the\natmosphere,\n\nthus changing\n\nland into a\n\nsource of CO 2. For example, carbon is\nreleased to the atmosphere when\nforests are cleared and burned.\nSpace-based remote sensing provided\nby the EOS will contribute\n\ninformation\n\non vegetation cover and its productivity,\ngeological and mineralogical formations, soil moisture, and forest fires. In\naddition,\n\ndetailed observations\n\nfrom the\n\nLandsat missions, which began in\n1972, will continue to reveal changes\nin land use and land cover.
