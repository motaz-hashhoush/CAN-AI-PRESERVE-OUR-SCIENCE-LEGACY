A welder having an electrode is mounted in an enclosure containing a pair of mirrors. The electrode passes through an opening in the first mirror and a gas cup. The mirror reflects an image of a welding operation taken through the opening of the gas cup to the second mirror. The second mirror then reflects the image through a rotary coupling to a third mirror which, in turn, reflects the image to a receiving lense mounted to a second rotatable coupling. The image is then projected via a fiber optic bundle to a filter unit where selected wavelengths of light are filtered from the welding image. The filter unit is coupled to an enlarger which enlarges the image and passes it to a camera. The camera is connected to an electronic eclipser which selectively darkens the brightest portions of the image. Finally, the image is recorded by a video tape recorder and displayed by a monitor.", "title": "Welding monitoring system", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-13T17:25:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19880004980, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Babcock, Stephen G."}, "organization": {"name": "Rockwell International Corp.", "location": "Canoga Park, CA., United States"}}, "id": "07a0f1067413438eb6a221bac65f2f7c"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19880004980, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Dyer, Gerald E."}, "organization": {"name": "Rockwell International Corp.", "location": "Canoga Park, CA., United States"}}, "id": "e884722b895d4ed9ae41e113d6c216b1"}, {"sequence": 2, "submissionId": 19880004980, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Gordon, Stephen S."}, "organization": {"name": "Rockwell International Corp.", "location": "Canoga Park, Calif., United States"}}, "id": "ab6532832d8949ac86972acfaddbda2e"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other - Patent", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-09-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19880004980, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19880004980, "id": "7732194e81364873a7ddd22be01b216f", "publicationDate": "1987-10-06T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"type": "SUPERSEDED_BY", "accessionNumber": "N87-25575"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19880004980.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19880004980/downloads/19880004980.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19880004980/downloads/19880004980.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19880004980/downloads/19880004980.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
