b'Abstract:\nNASA Studies the Earth from the Philippines\nThe Cloud, Aerosol and Monsoon Processes Philippines Experiment (CAMP2Ex) is a\nNASA/NRL mission studying clouds and aerosols with the NASA P-3B aircraft, a Learet\nand an ocean research vessel. The mission is based in the Philippines from late August\nthrough early October 2019. This presentation is aimed at 8-12th grade students in the\nPhilippines for education/outreach purposes to expose students to NASA Earth and\nAirborne Science research, the CAMP2Ex mission, and careers in science, technology,\nengineering and math (STEM).\nThe presentation starts with an overview of NASA Earth science, including discussing\nhow and why NASA studies the earth using satellites, airplanes, and sensors on the\nground. We discuss the NASA Airborne Science Program and how NASA uses\nairplanes to study the Earth from the equator to the poles. We discuss the CAMP2Ex\nmission specifically, including mission science goals and why we are based in the\nPhilippines. We will discuss basic cloud physics and remote sensing using\ndemonstrations and activities. Finally, we discuss careers in STEM and at NASA, giving\npersonal examples of the career paths of scientists, engineers and pilots on the\nCAMP2Ex mission.\n\n'
