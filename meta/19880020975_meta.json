In the learning phase, an expert teaches a strategy to the AT/I by providing it with declarative and procedural knowledge, expressed in the expert's domain-specific vocabulary. The expert can modify any advice given to the system earlier, and any advice dependent on the altered advice is reviewed automatically for syntatic and sematic soundness. Knowledge acquisition and methods for ensuring the integrity of the knowledge base in an expert system is discussed.", "title": "The advice taker/inquirer: A system for high-level acquisition of expert knowledge", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-05T18:57:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19880020975, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Cromp, Robert F."}, "organization": {"name": "Science Applications Research", "location": "Greenbelt, MD, United States"}}, "id": "ce3d5064615b4db6938812582fe44c7f"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-27T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19880020975, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19880020975, "id": "68b7b012522a43dc991ffa3d2fb0a92d", "publicationName": "NASA, Goddard Space Flight Center, The 1988 Goddard Conference on Space Applications of Artificial Intelligence", "publicationDate": "1988-08-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
