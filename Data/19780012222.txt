Historically, data\nfrom the mesosphere was of prime interest, but with increased sensitivity,\nconductivities extending into the stratosphere are possible.\nThe positive and negative conductivities produced by this technique\nhave been studied for insights into the dependence of the stratosphere\nand mesosphere on various geophysical influences. 2 Once the basic theory\nof ion collection was developed 3 \' 4 and verified, experimentally, various\nspecific programs have yielded much information. Early work showed that\nnighttime ionization in the 45 to 75 km region at mid-latitudes follows\na simple model. 5 Daytime results have shown that the transition region\nfrom solar to cosmic ray ionization (normally at 63.5 km) can be related\nto the density of nitric oxide, the main ion constituent in this region.6\nWhen a large enough statistical base was assembled, several interesting\ncorrelations were observed. Daytime negative conductivity in the 50 to\n60 km region correlates well with radio wave absorption which occurs at\nhigh altitudes. Positive ion conductivity correlates w611 with the\nneutral atmosphere temperature between 33 and 58 km. The temperature\ncoefficient observed is larger than that predicted by a simple ion\nchemistry model.\n\n\xe2\x80\x94^\t\n\nr\t\n\nAasLae - \t\n\nWW\t\n\n=\n\nN \'e\t\n\ns^\t\n\n5 we gL"i\t\n\nS\t\n\nr\t\n\ns -,\t\n\ns\t\n\nit\t\n\na;\'^ = R\xc2\xb0\'\n\n,^\t\n\nI\n\nIn 1968 a direct NO measurement was made by observing the change\nin conductivity produced by an in situ ultraviolet lamp to photo-ionize\nNO. 8 Recently this work has continued with a larger sounding rocket\npayload utilizing a different probe geometry.9\nData obtained during the "winter anomaly," when increased radio\nwave absorption is observed, have shown are enhancement of positive\nconductivity when compared to "normal" days. 10\nNot all experiments can be >e-fined with a few launches, however.\n\t\nSome observations require a statistical base to demonstrate a predicted\nrelationship. The use of the Super Loki Dart sounding rocket is\nattractive for reducing flight costs and simplifying payload production.\nA Super Loki blunt probe system has been developed with plans and blueprints with several concurrent test firings. Now these probes can be\nproduced either in-house or commercially. It is expected that greater\nflexibility in planning specific programs will result, with a larger\ncatalog of data accumulating for statistical analysis.\n\ns\n\n]i\n\n^t\nf\n\nl\n\n(I\n\ni\n\ni\n\n3\nCHAPTER II\nTHE BLUNT PROBE EXPERIMENT\n\nThe basic operation of the blunt probe has been described elsewhere, 11,12\nbut will be briefly repeated here. The blunt probe is most useful as a\nsubsonic probe, deployed on a parachute, with data telemetried back to\nthe ground station via an L-band transmitter. A known waveform is applied\nbetween two electrodes immersed in the surrounding plasma and the resultant\ncurrent is observed. By use of the appropriate geometric scale factors,\none can then compute the ion conductivity.\nAs illustrated in Figure 2.1, the probe hangs vertically beneath a\nparachute. A large return electrode covers most of the long cylindrical\nsection, while the front plate consists of a circular collector disk\nsurrounded by a guard ring. This guard ring is maintained at the same\npotential as the collector disk and controls the fringing electric fields\nso that the E field at the collector disk is unif orm and predictable.\nThe current flowing to the collector disk is measured by an electrometer.\nThe sweep waveform of Figure 2.2 is applied to the return electrode.\nWhen this sweep waveform is positive, positive ions are collected at the\ncollector; when the sweep is negative, negative particles are collected.\nAs the applied sweep voltage is changed linearly, one observes the\ncollector current also changes linearly, as predicted. Both negative\nions and electrons (if present) are collected when the sweep is negative,\nDue to the high electron conductivity, the observed V-I characteristic\nusually has\n\nIn\n\na\n\ndifferent slope for negative sweeps.\n\none sense, the observed V-I characteristic is a measure of the\n\nconductance of the electrodes with the plasma. One must reduce\n\nany\n\neffects between the return electrode and the medium. The large size\n\n4\n1\n\nFRONT PLATE----^\'\n\n:CTOR\nRING\nK\n\nFigure 2.1: Deployed Super Loki Dart blunt probe.\'\n\nI\n\n4\nI\n\n^\n\n_\t\n\n_\t\n\n9\n\n{\na\n5\n\n-j 0\n\nt--*\n\n0\n\nFigure 2.2: Sweep waveform applied between electrodes.\n\nJ\t\n\n^I\n\n1\n\n\t\n\n.\n\n6\n\na\n\nof the return electrode helps, but at night the solution is not explicit\nr\t\n\nso that an iterative data reduction procedure is necessary.13\n-\t\n-\t\n\nj\n\nIn the daytime, however, the situation is improved by photo emission\nfrom the sides of the payload produced by the sun. This large electron\nr\n\nphoto emission forces the payload slightly positive a few tenths of a\nvolt until enough highly mobile electrons are attracted to produce an\nequilibrium. The result is that a relatively low impedance "connection"\nis maintained between the return electrode and the plasma. The "contact\nt\t\n\npotential" of a few tenths of a volt varies with altitude and payload\nprofile presented to the sun. Unstable parachutes sometime result in\na modulation of this profile and potential and the collected electron\ncurrent. With the return electrode thus essentially held at the plasma\npotential, the front collector is swept both positively and negatively.\nThe downward facing front plate avoids photo emission from the surface.\nSolar zenith angles may be important if large parachute swings are\nexpected.\nA typical data waveform is shown in Fig. 2.3. Here the positive\nconductivity observed first is less than the negative conductivity. A\nlarge dynamic range (10 3 to 10 4 ) can be handled in this way since the\nslope can vary from very steep to very flat and still be observable by\nappropriate expansion of the vertical or horizontal time scale during\ndata tape playback.\nPayload calibration is performed as a ground preflight procedure.\nSince the conductivity of the atmosphere at sea level is very low, the\nobserved payload response is very small, essentially no vertical deflection.\nA minute or so of data recorded in this "flight" mode provides a permanent\nindication of payload health. Then a calibration is recorded for a ^.^ew\n\n7\nminutes by engaging a relay which switches in a known high value\nresistor between the sweep and the collector. During data playbac?, the\ncalibration section of data is reproduced for each setting of the chart\nrecorder sensitivity and speed. In this way all intermediate systematic\nerrors are removed.\nManual data reduction consists of finding the slopes of each conductance and relating these slopes to the corresponding o+ or o- through\na payload geometry factor. The time code which has been recorded on a\nseparate tape channel is used with radar data to determine the altitude\nof the probe at each sweep time. The real time data chart from the\nTMQ-5 recorder of the GMD L-band receiver is useful for planning the\ndata reduction of a particular flight. Usually three or four different\nexpansion factors are needed. A full scale (0 to 200 Hz) playback at\na fast chart speed (20 mm/sec) is needed for the large conductivities\nobserved directly after expulsion. Since the negative conductivities\nare very large, a fast response chart recorder is required (BW :: 100 Hz).\nA second data playback with an expanded vertical scale and a slower chart\nspeed (5 mm/sec) is used. Later portions of the flight may require an\neven larger (10 or 20 Hz) vertical expansion. For each chart record,\na calibration record is also made with the same recorder settings. The\naverage of the calibration slopes is used in the computation of the\nconductivities.\nData reduction proceeds by finding the slope of each part of each\nsweep and then computing the corresponding conductivity by use of the\nproper probe theory.\n4\t\n\n0+ -\n\nc\t\nG_\n\n_R\n2r2 Rcal\n\ndata slop +\t\ne\ndata slope avg\n\nmho/cm\t\n\n(1)\n\nR\n\ndata slo eL- -\t\ncal slope avg\n\nmho/cm\t\n\n(2)\n\n_\t\n2r2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 ,,\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\n\'\n^wc^1CLi3ti67rkR^kTi^:^\'v^ .\t\n\nC 6 l " . , ..\t\n\n8\n\nwhere for the Super Loki blunt probe, r is the radius of the collector\ndisk, .5 inch; R is the\nthe resistance of the c\nThus converting th\n.6476\t\n\nd\n\nR cal\t\n\nC\n\nRsa+.w\n\na,\t\n\n9\nCHAPTER III\nSUPER LOKI BLUNT PROBE\n\nA block diagram of the blunt probe is shown in Figure 3.1. A six\nvolt nickel cadmium battery supplies power to the transmitter tube filament\nand a power supply converter which in turn produces +110 volts for the\ntransmitter and \xc2\xb1 7.5 volts, regulated, for the rest of the electronics.\nA sweep generator produces the desired sweep waveform which is applied\nto the`-return electrode. The current received by the collector is\nmeasured by an electrometer whose output voltage drives a voltagecontrolled oscillator. This VCO has a linear modulation characteristic\nwith a nominal 100 Hz center frequency.\nfout\t\n\n(100 - K\n\nI collector )Hz\n\n\t\n\n(4)\n\nfor a zero to 200 Hz span. The short negative pulses from the VCO\nmomentarily turn off the L-band transmitter at the repetition rate of\nthe VCO.\nThe complete schematic of the blunt probe is shown in Fig. 3.2.\nInternal power is activated by a latching relay, RY1. Short energizing\npulses through the umbilical engage or disengage this relay. Operation\non external power through the umbilical is also possible. This control\narrangement is identical to that of the Loki datasonde system. The power\nsupply inverter is similar to that used in the Super Loki Transponder\nDatasonde, 1S except that symmetric low voltage supplies are used.\nThe sweep generator is formed by three sections of the LM324 quad\noperational amplifier. The first section is a free running multivibrator\nwhich determines the basic sweep rate and "rest" period at the beginning\nof each sweep. Sweep capacitor C6 is charged through diode D4.

The third section is used as a comparator\n31\n\nto turn off the current sink at the end of the desired sweep.\nThe electrometer is made possible by the very small input bias current\nrequired by the ICH 8500A. This MOSFET input operational amplifier\nconverts the collector current to an output voltage. The sensitivity\nis determined by feedback resistor R27. The negative feedback action\nmaintains the collector disk at the guard potential. A resistorcapacitor network consisting of R21, R22, R23, R24, and C 18 provide\n\t\n\nfrequency compensation for the best response time of the electrometer.\n\nI\n\nThe 741 op amp increases the loop gain for increased response time but is\nnot needed for lower sensitivities. The calibration resistor, R28, is\nswitched between ground for "flight" mode and the sweep output ("cal.")\nby relay RY2. The entire electrometer is contained within a shielded\nassembly to prevent RF interference.\nThe VCO uses the last section of the quad op amp to generate a\ncurrent proportional to the electrometer output. C 2 , C 3 are the VCO\ntiming capacitors while R2 sets the VCO pulse width_ These VCO pulses\nkey off the 1680 MHz transmitter which is the same telemetry system used\nr\nby the Loki datasondes. Final transmitter frequency is field adjustable\nwith a set screw adjustment.\n\nSelf- sticking\n\ncopper foil. wrapped around the payload forms the\n\nreturn electrode and is soldered to the conical ground plane for the\nwhip antenna. The one-inch section of exposed fiberglass body next to\nthe guard ring is painted white to reduce the heat gain when exposed to\nsunlight.\n\nr\n\n13\nWith the lanyard fastened off axis as shown in Fig. 3.3., the\nprobe face is not perpendicular to the airflow, but this particular probe\ngeometry is not sensitive to the angle of attack of the probe. it should\nalso be noted that the umbilical connector at the side of the probe has\n-110 volts exposed on it which, if left uncovered, will distort the\nparticle collection. Two types of covers have been used. One solution\nis a small steel spring umbilical flap which closes over the connector.\nAnother solution developed by Space Data Corporation is a small sliding\ndoor which retracts under the copper foil return electrode, After the\numbilical is pulled, a short pull string guides the cover in place,\nAll payload surfaces are carefully cleaned with acetone during\nassembly before the payload is inserted in its staves in the Super Loki\nDart body.\nData reduction is accomplished by a tape playback into a tachometer\nwhich yields an output voltage proportional to the input frequency\n(Fig. 3.4). The tachometer consists of a monostable multivibrator which\nproduces uniform height and width pulses which are fed to a lowpass\nfilter. A 10 Hz lowpass rolloff is usually sufficient, but additional\nfiltering may be necessary for noisy data at the expense of reduced\nresponse time for high conductivities.\n\nw\n\n14\n\ni\n\nA\n\n1\t\n\nu \t\n\n3.\n\nred Suner Loki 1 , ., c r\t\n\n)robs\n\nORIGINAL PAGE IS\nOF POOR QUALITY\n\n15\n\nD\n\na.\n\nU f--\n\n^ O\nO\n\ni\ni\n\nN\n\nI\n\n^\' W\n\nI\n\nI\n\na f-\n\n-\'\n\nI\n\nI\n\no"\n\nI\n\ncr\n\nI\n\nw\n0\ncr\n\niw\n\nI\n\nJ\n\nG\n\nO\nU\n\nw\nIi\n\nU\n\nIa\n\nI^\nI\n\ni\n\nJO\nm\n\n0\n.,i\niJ\n\ncr-\n\nIw\n\nCd\n\n7\ncr\na\n\n^, m\n\nI\n\n^ ^\n\nI\n\nO\n\nJ\n\n^\n\nU\n\nI\n\nI\n\n0\n\nU\n\n^\n\nx\nU\nco\n\ncd\n\nw\nG\no\n\n-J\n\n^\nCL\n\nww\nma\n^o\n\na\nca\n\nro\nQ\n\nCi\na\n\n.r.,\n\na\n\nw\na\na\n\nO\n\nU\n\nw\na\nw\na\na\n\nf-\n\nw\n\n.\n\nmy\n\nj\t\na\n\n16\nCHAPTER IV\nFLIGHT HISTORY\n\ni\nA series of developmental shots have been used to prove out the\ndesign. The first launch on May 2, 1975 ,, was done without an umbilical\nflap to verify if a flap was indeed necessary. The data obtained\n(Fig. 4.1) sh.ows nominal positive conductivities, but the negative\nconductivities are quite depressed, and not unexpected effect on the\nhighly mobile electrons. All later flights have included an umbilical\nflap (and of course, a cover over the transmitter frequency adjust set\nacrew). While the next payloads were assembled, a detailed assembly\nmanual was. written to supplement a complete set of blueprints. One of\nthese flights (Fig, 4,2) experienced a shift in telemetried response\ncausing loss of a portion of the data, A post mortem of the payload\nafter recovery showed that the calibrate relay had not returned to its\nnormally closed ground connection. Since the relay load is a very "dry"\ncircuit, this is a potential problem, but no additional cases have\noccurred (Fig, 4,3).

It is expected that NO is selectively\nionized by this radiation and the increase in ionization can be compared\nto the unperturbed medium on alternate sweep cycles. Recently, the\ntechnique has been used on Astrobee-D sounding rockets with a Gerdien\ncondenser probe geometry.\n\n15,16\n\nThe Gerdien geometry yields more informa-\n\ntion than the blunt probe, both conductivity and mobility of the ion\nspecies;. however, it is angle-of-attack sensitive, so that much more\nstable parachutes are necessary.\nAn attempt has been made to reduce this payload\'s complexity and\nsize so that a more. synoptic type instrument would result. The Arcassized payload of Fit,. 5.1 resulted as a development. The size has been\nreduced to an acceptable level for the Arcas, but the weight is still\nlarger than desired, primarily due to the additional batteries needed\nto power the UV lamp. A complete schematic is shown in Fig. 5.2. As\ncan be seen, the electrometer telemetry and sweep are similar to that\nof the blunt probe. In addition, a flipflop counts the sweeps and turns\non the VHF lamp oscillator on alternate cycles. Also, the power supply\ninverter has been modified to better take advantage of available amphour capacity.\nThis particular flight was considered an intermediate design both\nof hardware and overall experiment. The primary electronic problem\nremaining is the excessive weight of the lamp batteries. The convenience\nof rechargeable batteries may have to be foregone for a higher energy\n\n22\n\ns\n\nC\n\nS\n\nw\n\n4\n\n4\n\n-I\n\nFigure 5.1: Gerdien condenser with tlasFing Lyman\t\n1\t\n\nj\t\n\nlzmp\nORIGI:N\'Ai, PAGE IS\nnF POOR QUALITY\n\n\t\n\nrl\n\n.^\t\n\n23\n\n^^I }^^IHII } ^\t\n\n9\n^>>\n\n:O\t\n\nOil\t\n\nry\t\n\nL\n\ni t \xe2\x96\xba^\n\n1\'\t\n\nv +\t\n\nI\t\n\nTO\t\n\nq\t\n\nI ,\t\nI\t\n\n\'r\t\n\n\t\n\nII\n\n1\n\nM\n\na ^.\xe2\x80\xa2 1\t\n\np`\t\n\nIn\n\n^\n\nN\t\n\n5 III\t\n\n^\n\nHII\t\n\nf\t\n\n\t\n\nI\t\n\n=^ I\n\n/\t\n\nY\n\nd0\n\n\tL\n^\nI\n^ \' \\^\n\\J\nI\'\t\nW\t\n^\n\nr\n\nn\n\n1 ^\n\nr ^`\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nN\t\n\nN\t\nO\t\nA\t\n\n*\t\n\nII\t\n\n12,\t\n\n10\np\t\np^\t\n\ns\n\xe2\x80\x94\n\nO\t\nO\n\n2\nN\n\n\xe2\x99\xa6\t\n\nn\t\n\nZ\t\n\nz\t\nN\t\n\nII\t\n\n\t\n\nO\nh\n\nO\t\n\nN\t\n\n\xe2\x80\x94\t\n\n\xe2\x96\xba\n\nHII\t\n\n,\n\nU\n\nti\n\nO\nO\t\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nz\t\n-\t\nA\t\n\ne\n\na\n\na\t\n\nf a\t\n\n.\t\n\nca\n[r\n\nv\n\na\nr\n\na\t\n\np\t\n\nN \xe2\x80\x94\t\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Y\nin 2p\n\nW\np i\'\t\n\n.n\t\n\na\t\n\n.H\n\n\xe2\x99\xa6\nPf\n\n\'o\nn\nz\nN\n\nI, $\t\n\n^\t\n\n2\n\nn\n-\n\n,.0\nU\n\nN\nQ\n\nn\n\nO\t\nO\n\nM\t\n\nro\n\n\xe2\x99\xa6\t\n\nI\t\n\nN\t\n\nI\t\n\nO\t\nO\t\n\nI\t\n\na I\t\nel\t\nIIN I\t\n\n\'\t\n\n2\n\no\t\nla\n\n,.\t\nf\n\nY\t\n\na\n\nI\t\n\nI\t\nI\t\n\n1\t\n\nI\n\n\xe2\x80\x94HII--- \'\t\n\xe2\x96\xbaI\t\n\xe2\x96\xba\nN^\nI\t\nO\t\n^,\t\nI\t\nI\t\n\n^p\n\nZ\t\n\nO\n\n^n<\nm\n\n< p\t\nU r\n\nII\n\nN\n\nN\t\n\n1\t\n\nr\t\n\nY\n\nN\n\nCD\n\nN\n\nT\n\n^4\n\nO$\nv\n\na\n\n\t\n\no\t\n\nG\nQ)\n\n.H\n\nM\n\n.LI\'. ^\xc2\xb0\t\n\nW\n\n0\nU\n\nar 1\n\xe2\x96\xbaz \xe2\x99\xa6\nm\n\xe2\x96\xba^\nQ\nA Na\n\nI\t\n\nI\t\n\n=\t\n\n\xe2\x99\xa6\nN\n\nI\t\n\nHII a I\no\t\no=\t\nY\t\nno I Oa\t\n\xe2\x96\xbaI\t I\t\n^\t\n\nn\t\n=\t\n\nI\t\n\nI\t\n\na\t\n\noa\t\n\nI\t\nI\t\nI\t\n\n^-1\n\nis a\n\nau\n\n"^\n\nNII-\n\nQ\n\na\n\nY\nti\n\xe2\x99\xa6\n\nU\n^_\n\nI\t\n\nU\t\n\na\t\n*\t\n\nI\n\nO\n\n3\n^\n\nI \xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nI\t\n\n$_\t\n\nY\t\n\n;\t\n\n(\t\n\nH,,\t\n\nI\t\n\nHII\t\n\nII\t\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Y O\t\n\nr0\t\n\nN\t\n\n\t<\t\nm\n_\t\n4\n\na\t\n\nI\t\n\nbo\n\nz\n\n.H\n\n..\t\n\n^\t\n\na\nW\n\np\t\n\nI\t\n\n, u y\t\n\nI\t\n\nI\t\n\nA I \t\n\n$\t\n\xe2\x80\x94\t\n\nM\n\nPrI\n\nY\n0\n\nU\t\nW\n^\t\nt\t\n\nII\n\nr\nU\n\nill\n\nl\n\n24\ni\n\ndensity non-rechargeable type.

The existing Super Arcas blunt probe approach has\nbeen miniaturized for use with the 2-1/8 inch Super Loki Dart. A detailed\nassembly manual and blueprint have been generated to enable NASA in house\nas well as commercial production of these probes. Several developmental\nflights have been flown successfully and consultation support has been\ngiven to enable production of the probes in house at Wallops Flight\n\t\n\nCenter. Development work has been done on an advanced probe which\n\nE\n\nprovides in situ ultraviolet-induced, additional ionization. While\nadditional work needs to be done on this Lyman-a probe, the Super Loki\nr\n\n\t\n\n4\n\n\'I\n\n,I\n\nblunt probe has proved itself to be a reliable experiment.\n\n{i\n\n26\nREFERENCES\n\n1.
