Two thermistors are used,\none exposed directly to vacuum and the other exposed\nto a secondary chamber formed by the seal being\nmonitored and a second auxiliary seal.

Since no other vent exists,\nall gas leaking past main seal 20 will exit through tubing\n26 regardless of the length of main seal 20. Heater 28\nand temperature sensor 30, mounted adjacent to each 5\nother within tubing 26, are attached by some conventional means such as heat insulating ceramic, whereby\nno heat-is conducted to tubing 26 or fixed member 18\nwhen energy source 32 is activated to cause a temperature rise of heater 28. The temperature actually 10\nreached by heater 28 will be dependent upon the energy transmitted to it by energy source 32 through feed\nlines 34 and upon the heat removed from it by cooling.\nWhen no gas is being vented through tubing 26 this\ncooling will only be by radiation, but when gas vents, 15\nthe cooling will dramatically increase and therefore the\ntemperature of heater 28 as measured by temperature\nsensor 30 will go down. This temperature decrease is\ndirectly related to gas leakage past main seal 20.\nReference heater 36 and reference temperature sen- 20\nsor 38 are mounted in tubing 40 by the identical\nmethod that heater 28 and temperature sensor 30 are\nmounted tubing 26. Moreover, the characteristics of\nboth heaters and both temperature sensors are\nmatched so that when reference heater 36 is fed from 25\nenergy source 32 through feed lines 34 the only difference in response of the temperature of both heaters is\ncaused by gas flow cooling of heater 28. The temperatures of reference heater 36 and heater 28 are compared by temperature comparator 42 connected by 30\nlines 44 and therefore temperature changes not associated with gas leak rate are eliminated.\nThe system described is particularly suited for continuous monitoring of leaks because of its very low\npower drain. This results because of the positioning\'of 35\nboth heaters in the vacuum environment. In such an environment a heater is subject to an absolute minimum\nof cooling since no convection occurs and the mounting method, as described above, severely limits the heat\nconduction to other parts of the assembly. Thus, the 40\nonly cooling method available is radiation which itself\nis highly dependent upon the temperature of the\nheater. Therefore, since for any temperature of operation the power used by the heaters is equal to that carried away by cooling mechanisms the power consumption of the invention is drastically limited by using a relatively low operating temperature for the heaters. The\noperating temperature is that temperature at which the\nheaters stabilize when no leak exists.\n50\nFIG. 2 depicts a preferred embodiment of the invention for use in conjunction with a spacecraft hatch.\nHatch 50 moves away from bulkhead 52 in direction 53\nand normally seals against main seal 54 leaving an expected leak path around main seal 54 between cabin\natmosphere 56 and vacuum environment 58. O-ring 60\nis mounted in channel 62 to form a secondary seal and\nclose off detector chamber 64. Passage 66 vents -any\ncabin atmosphere 56 leaking past main seal 54 to vacuum environment 58. Sensing thermistor 68 combines\nthe functions and characteristics of both the heater 28\nand temperature sensor 30 of FIG. 1 and is mounted in\npassage 70 by potting compound 72 which also encloses lead 74 connecting thermistor 68 in to a conventional Wheatstone bridge circuit 76. Reference thermistor 78, with characteristics matched to sensing thermistor 68, is similarly mounted in hole 80 filled with\npotting compound 82 to enclose lead 84 to bridge cir-\n\ncuit 76. The result is identical thermistor installations\nexcept for the cooling effect of the gas leak upon sensing thermistor 68. Bridge circuit 76 serves the dual purpose of supplying both sensing thermistor 68 and reference thermistor 78 with energy to heat them and comparing the resistances of the two thermistors which are\na direct measure of their temperatures. The indication\ngiven by bridge circuit 76 is therefore a direct and sensitive reading of the leak rate past main seal 54. In a\ntypical installation using thermistors, leak rates as low\nas 10"8 standard cubic centimeters per second will be\ndetected with response times in milliseconds.\nIt is to be understood that the forms of the invention\nherein shown are merely preferred embodiments.
