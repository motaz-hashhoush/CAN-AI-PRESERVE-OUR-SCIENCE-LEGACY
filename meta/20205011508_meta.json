One possible solution to help reduce this risk is the addition of in situ produced supplemental fresh produce to supplement and enhance the astronaut diet.  A number of ground and ISS-based studies are being conducted which are helping to reduce this risk by filling the gaps in knowledge and technology associated with space crop production.   These include studies with the Veggie vegetable production system on the International Space Station.  Key focus areas include water and nutrient delivery, food safety and the crop microbiome, crop selection and testing, automation and robotics, radiation impacts, seed storage and handling, and scalability for different concepts and architectures.  All of these areas have significant challenges that need to be addressed prior to successful integration of crop production into the crew diet.  Data from these studies is feeding the development of new technologies and systems for space crop production.  This research was funded by NASA Space Biology and NASA\u2019s Human Research Program.
