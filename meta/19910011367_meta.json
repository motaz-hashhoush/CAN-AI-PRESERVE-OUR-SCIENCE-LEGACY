It will be utilized for short range scheduling, controlling work flow on the floor, and providing near real-time status for all major space transportation systems (STS) work centers at KSC. It will increase personnel and STS safety and improve productivity through deeper active scheduling that includes tracking and correlation of STS and ground support equipment (GSE) configuration and work. It will also provide greater accessibility to this data. WFA defines a standards concept for scheduling data which permits both commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) scheduling tools and WFA developed applications to be reused. WFA will utilize industry standard languages and workstations to achieve a scalable, adaptable, and portable architecture which may be used at other sites.", "title": "KSC's work flow assistant", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T14:24:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19910011367, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Wilkinson, John"}, "organization": {"name": "Lockheed Space Operations Co.", "location": "Cocoa Beach, FL, United States"}}, "id": "b1605e8abc6a408789819bcd5da33bb7"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19910011367, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Johnson, Earl"}, "organization": {"name": "Lockheed Space Operations Co.", "location": "Cocoa Beach, FL, United States"}}, "id": "15446fd5e20c4445a3773aabf94c598f"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19910011367, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19910011367, "id": "90306f1e06aa472c9198099f2b3bf949", "publicationName": "NASA, Lyndon B.
