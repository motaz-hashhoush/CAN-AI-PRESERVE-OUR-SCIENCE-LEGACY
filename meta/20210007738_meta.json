The thermal performance of the microcooler was measured in vacuum for heat reject temperatures between 185 and 300 K. The cooler was driven with a Chroma 61602 AC power source for input powers ranging from 10 to 60 W and drive frequency between 115 and 140 Hz during thermal performance testing. The optimal drive frequency was dependent on both input power and heat reject temperature. In addition, the microphonics of the cooler were measured with the cooler driven by Iris Technologies LCCE-2 and HP-LCCE drive electronics for input powers ranging from 10 to 60 W and drive frequency between 135 and 145 Hz. The exported forces were strongly dependent on input power while only weakly dependent on the drive frequency. Moreover, the exported force in the compressor axis was minimized by closed loop control with the HP-LCCE. The cooler also survived a 500 krad radiation dose while being continuously operated with 30 W of input power at 220 K heat rejection temperature in vacuum. Finally, the DC and AC magnetic fields around the cooler were measured at various locations.", "title": "Characterization Testing of Lockheed Martin High-Power Micro Pulse Tube Cryocooler", "stiType": "PREPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20210007738, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Rodriguez, Jose I."}}, "id": "1eb354c02c7444eb9e47b1c3ef5c6281"}, {"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20210007738, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Johnson, Dean L."}}, "id": "de3d1b4a1694478a89a7a64e8dc09f01"}, {"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20210007738, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Hummel, Chris D."}}, "id": "5edc44bb6d2e42b784f9cc7ea5445477"}, {"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20210007738, "meta": {"author": {"name": "McKinley, Ian M."}}, "id": "eef1b7e2c3d242dc936ae4067136913b"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Preprint (Draft being sent to journal)", "technicalReviewType": "NOT_SET", "modified": "2022-09-30T05:14:36.8017770+00:00", "id": 20210007738, "sourceIdentifiers": [{"number": "2014/47582", "type": "HANDLE"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20210007738, "publisher": "Pasadena, CA: Jet Propulsion Laboratory, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, 2017", "id": "be5a8864bc4345479042522ca04ae8ec", "publicationDate": "2017-07-10T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
