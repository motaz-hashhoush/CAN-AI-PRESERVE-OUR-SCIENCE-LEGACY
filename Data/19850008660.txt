Glassburn\nPlanning Research Corp.\nKSC, Florida\n\n" ABSTRACT\nBecause the venting of free hydrogen gas to the atmosphere presents an extremely hazardous situation, it was necessary to devise a means for safe, controlled venting of the Shuttle external tank (ET}\ngaseous hydrogen (GH2) during and after liquid hydrogen (LH2) tank loading.\nSeveral design concepts\nthat were considered-initially\nwere discarded as unfeasible because of vehicle weight restrictions,\nhigh cost, and because the proposed structure was itself deemed a hazard due to the vehicle\'s nonvertical launch trajectory.\nA design concept employing a support structure/access\narm attached to the\nFixed Service Structure (FSS) was finally selected.\nThe various design problems resolved included vent\narm disconnect/drop\ninterference, minimizing refurbishment due to launch damage, disconnect reliability, vehicle movement tracking, minimizing vent line pressure drop, and the presence of other vehicle\nservices at the same centralized supply area.\nSix launches have proven the "system" to be reliable,\nefficient, and of nearly zero refurbishment cost.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nAfter a device or system has been developed, even we engineers who were involved in the .development sometimes tend to look at the end product in its most obvious and most simplified form without\nthinking about how it got to be what it is. In almost all cases (be it a washing machine, car, house,\nor Shuttle system), that end product has evolved.\nThe evolution is initiated by a need, which in turn\ncauses development facets which we label es1_concept,\nanalysis, hard design, fabrication, testing,\nand utilization.\nIn between are literally hundreds of steps, decision points, and iterations that influence the end product.\nThe most obvious major influences, though, are requirements, requirement\nchanges, design accuracy as proven by test, and subtle operational changes t_at only become visible\nduring the testing and operations application.\nSuch complexity as noted above is related in this paper on the Space Shuttle ET hydrogen vent arm\nsystem.\nThe history of how that system evolved is an interesting blend of requirements and technology\nutilization.\nThe basic requirement that initiated the vent arm design effort was, and still\ncontrolled means of safely venting the GH2 that is boiled off in the Shuttle LR2 ET\nLH2 loading.\nThis paper relates how that requ_ement\nwas met.\nWe will start where\nwas first delineated and the challenge set. We will then progress through each step\nto relate what was done and why, and will conclude with the present system.\n\nis, to provide a\nduring and after\nthe initial need\nof the evolution\n\nTHE CHALLENGE\nAs noted earlier, the basic requirement was to safely vent the GH2 that is boiled off during and\nafter ET LH2 loading.\nThis translated into more specific requirements as follows:\no\n\nProvide a system to transfer\npond.\n\nthe GH2 boiloff to cross-country\n\no\n\nEnsure that the system is connected\n\no\n\nTrack all vehicle motions\n\nvent piping and thence to a burn\n\nand operable until Shuttle launch is certain.\n\ndue to wind,\n\nsolar, cryo, or other effects.\n\nA secondary (but important) requirement was to provide an intertank purge system.\nThis was never\na design driver, but it is noted herein because the purge system was always considered to be coincidental with the GH 2 vent system.\nThe systems physically had to go to the same vehicle area and could\nthus physically be (literally) tied to each other.\n\n942\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 ,\'\n\n\xc2\xb8\xc2\xb8\xc2\xb83\n\nCONCEPT\n\nI\n\nThe initial concept was a straightforward and simple venting method.\nAs shown in figure 1, the\nsystem would pipe the GH2 directly from the top of the LH2 tank down the side of the ET to a rise-off\numbilical disconnect system in a tail service mast (TSM).\nFrom there, the GH 2 would be piped around\nthe Mobile Launcher Platform (MLP) to the LH2 disconnect tower and then to the burn pond.\nAlthough this concept was simple, it was shelved rather quickly.\nAt the same time the concept\nwas being developed, Shuttle weight was becoming more and more a prime design driver.\nIn the concept\'s final form, the weight of the piping, insulation, and tunneling was considered excessive unless\nno other viable alternative could be found.\n\nCONCEPTS\n\nII AND III\n\nThe obvious approach to reducing vent system and purge system weight was to pipe directly from/to\nthe intertank area.\nThe major portion of the piping system\'s weight, then, would not be a direct part\nof the Shuttle. To do this would require a new umbilical plate, some sort of hanging or extended piping, and a disconnect method.\nTwo concepts were thence developed which utilized tall structures to\nsatisfy the accompanying vent and purge lines location, type of routing, and control needed.\nConcept\nII is shown in figure 2.\nIt would utilize a new tower that would be built on the north end of the\nMLP. Concept Ill is shown in figure 3.\nIt would utilize the FSS as its design base, namely, one corner of the 203-ft level.\nBoth concepts first used thelraditional\nhorizontal swing-away umbilical system. However, in both cases, layouts and artlculation analyses showed that the lengths of access arms\nneeded, masses of the arms, and amount of rotation needed versus time to rotate for T-O operations were\nall incongruent with design of a practical system.\nThus, the drop-away umbilical-line\napproach was\nused, as shown in figures 2 and 3.\nBoth concepts had to meet the same physical restrictions of the Shuttle.\nThese were:\ntrack the\nvehicle motions (regardless of cause), impose minimum forces on the Shuttle, and establish disconnect\nreliably, all without harming the vehicle.\nAs the concepts developed, it became apparent that another\nrequirement existed.\nThe vehicle liftoff is not just up, but it also has an associated drift.\nThus,\nwhatever support structure was to be used and the vent and purge systems themselves could not be in the\nway of the vehicle.\nThe restrictions on the physical location of Concept II\'s tower on the MLP were\nsuch that the tower would interfere with Shuttle liftoff.\nThat in itself was enough to eliminate Concept II from further consideration.\nAdded to this was the fact that the MLP would have to have major\n(expensive and technically undesirable) modifications to its north end to support the tower.\nConcept III remained, then, as the most viable basic concept.\nAs figure 3 shows, it consisted of\na fixed arm, a retractable access (swing) arm for vent line hookup, and a vent line consisting of flexible and hard sections.\n(The intertank purge line would be piggyback.)\nThe vent line was to be disconnected with a conventional mechanical advantage mechanism, i.e., a "hockey-stick" device, activated\nat the proper time by use of a lanyard. The vent line then would drop in a guided path.\nIt would be\nexpendable and thus be replaced after each launch.\nAt this point in time, many situations seemed to develop almost simultaneously.\nStudies of other\nET systems kept resulting in more and more systems and requirements being added to the "vent arm assembly."\nImprovements in systems control, vehicl_welght\nreduction, physical limitations or improvements,\nand/or safety aspects were the design drivers for these new systems requirements.\nIt became apparent\nthat a centralized access ground support equipment (GSE) grouping was needed.\nFor example, GSE ET\nliquid oxygen (LOX) vent valve control was deemed necessary, so the pneumatic and electrical systems\nfor that control were routed with the vent arm.\nRange safety needs (electrical), nose cone purge\n(pneumatics), ET instrumentation\n(electrical), and antl-iclng/bipod\nheater power/control\n(electrical)\nwere other needs routed with the _ent arm.\nAll of these, of course, affected the umbilical plate design itself and design iterations thereof.\nIn addition, the access hatch to get into the intertank\narea was moved to the swing arm area to allow access on more than a contingency/emergency\nbasis.\nAs the "group system" grew in total systems being accommodated, studies continued on the vent\nline itself. The line was sized several times. This was not an easy task because the diameterIs) had\nto be minimum to allow the total line to be manageable, hard sections were needed to support all of\nthe pneumatic lines and electrical wires that were by then being routed with the vent line, and flexIble sections were needed to account for vehicle tracking and similar movement aspects; yet the pressure drop through the line had to be minimal.\n(0.5 pound per square Inch differential (psid) was the\nfinal design goal for the total vent line from the umbilical plate to the burn pond.)\nOne vent study showed that the line and its umbilical plate would, when released, scrape the side\nof the ET -- even if the vehicle did not "move into" the plate at disconnect.\nThis situation forced a\ndesign change to provide for linear retraction of the vent arm at disconnect before the line would be\n, _.i-. :;:::t;\'\ni\n;)\ng43\n\n4: :iJ\n..\n\n(-:\n\ne..\n\n/\n\n,\n\n/\n\nORBITER\n\n/\n\n_,_\n\n.I\n\n_\n\n, _\'"f r\'_\n\n_1\n\nET UMBILICAL\n\nR,BE ,F\nn\n\n_ m\n\n/_\n\nEXHAUST\n\n_\'_ "\n\n,--. .\n-\n\nHOLE "---\'J\n\n/\n\n/\nORBITER "--\'\nHOLE-\n\n"\n\n"-" SRB\n\nMLP DECK\n\n.-\n\n.\n\n."\n.r\n\nFIGURE1.

The tests did_ot\nshow any major design deficiencies\xe2\x80\xa2\nBasically, the system was fine tuned with the tests as well as being qualified mechanically.\nThe only design\naspect that was questioned aggressively, i_.,\nthe disconnect method, was settled by the tests. The\nfirst concept verification testing (CVT) series of the lanyard umbilical disconnect was conducted before the pyrotechnic bolts were selected as the design approach\xe2\x80\xa2\nThe second test series system qualification testing employed the bolts and proved the design concept.\n\nii \xe2\x80\xa2!\n\xc2\xb8\nPRESENT ASSEMBLY\nIn summary, the external tank GH2 vent arm presently provides for more than just venting GH2.\nIt\nis an access system for the ET intertank area, and it provides for GH2 venting, for all ET electrical\nand pneumatic support subsystems (including all gas purges), and for umbilical plate service in itself.\nThe assembly is best described in two parts:\nET vent umbilical system and intertank access arm.\n\nET HYDROGEN\n\nL_ _T-_ I_\'L.\n_\n\nVENT UMBILICAL\n\nSYSTEM\n\nThis system provides for continuous venting of the Shuttle El" during and after LH 2 loading.\nIt\nalso provides the pneumatic line and electrical cables between the ground systems and the umbilical\ninterface.\nThe umbilical system disconnects at solid rocket booster (SRB) ignition command.\nThe hydrogen vent line then pulls back, drops away, and is secured during vehicle liftoff.\nFigure 4 depi_ts\nthe system.\nVent Line Assemb1_\nThis assembly consists of two vacuum jacketed flexhoses and one double wall hardline.\nThe aft\nflexhose makes the connection between the hardline subassembly and the facility vent line interface.\nThe forward flexhose makes the connection between the hardline subassembly and the intertank hydrogen\nvent umbilical interface.\nStructural\n\nPlatform\n\nExtension\n\nThe platform extension has four levels floored with steel grating.\nIt provides space for equipment installation and personnel access for service, maintenance, and checkout of the vent line and access arm.\nA platform is attached to the side of the main platform providing a base for mounting the\nhinge actuation mechanism of the access arm, the haunch pivot fixture, the withdrawal mechanism,\nand\nthe deceleration unit.\nHaunch Pivot Fixture\nThis is a structural enclosure mounted on the top level of the fixed platform extension.\nThe\nhaunch pivot fixture contains the pivot links which support the facility end of the vent line and allow the vent line to adjust for vehicle movement and misalignment.\nThe haunch also provides mountings\n\n947\n\n.t\n\nHAUNCH\nFIXTURE\n\nGROUND\nUMBILICAL\nCARRIER\n\nPIVOT\n\nFORWARD\nFLEX\n\nHARDLINE\nSUBASSEMBLY\n\nET\n,SKIN\nPANEL\n\nWITHDRAWAL\nMECHANISM\n/\n\nAFT FLEX\nHOSE\n\n/\n\n/\nVENT LINE\n\nTACT\nTI( :)N -_\n\nt\n\nDROP PATH\n\n"-_\n\n/\n\nY\nFINAL\nPOSITION\nA\nVIEW A--A\n\nFIGURE 4.

The mechanism is designed to allow 6 inches of cable feedout prior to the secondary disconnect.\n\n_:_\n\nINTERTANK ACCESS ARM\nThe intertank access arm provides a movable work platform for prelaunch servicing and checkout of\nthe Space Shuttle ET Intertank area.\nIt provides the capability of lifting and positioning the vent\nline, installation with the ground umbilical carrier plate, personnel access for umbilical servicing,\npersonnel access to the intertank tank compartment, AC power, lighting, and environmental control system service.\nFigure 5 depicts the arm.\n\nTruss\n\nAssembl_\n\nThe top surface of the truss is floored with grating, which serves as a walkway for personnel access.\nThe line handling fixture Is attached to the outer end of the truss and provides an air motor\ndriven winch.\nThe winch is used for lifting the vent line into position for installation with the umbilical and supports th_ vent line until the access arm is retracted.\n\nHln_e Actuatin_\n\nMechanism\n\nThe hinge actuating mechanism is a hydraulic cyllnder actuated roller chain and sprocket drive\nunit.\nThe two hydraulic cylinders are powered by hydraulic fluid supplied from the facility hydraulic\nsystem.\nA manual valve on the control panel controls rotation of the access arm.\n\n949\n\n" :::: =4\n\n., .r-"\no..t,\n\n,r,\n\n\'"\n\xe2\x80\xa2 \'t\n\niCIilDJI#III\n\nFIIIE\n\n_--\n\n._ "\n".\n\n-- ITRUCTURAL\nI_ATFO_M\nEXTE\n.ION\n\nI.
