The SSD concept was developed by a team. The team involved\npersonnel from NASA Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC), Naval Air Warfare Center-Weapons\nDivision\n(NAWC-WPNS),\nSY Technologies\n(SYT), Blue Line Engineering (BLE), and Georgia Tech Research\nInstitute (GTRI). The Program Manager for the effort was Mr. E. (Sandy) Montgomery\nat MSFC.\nThe objectives of the SSD were to demonstrate functionality\nand performance\nof a seven segment\nprototype array of hexagonal mirrors and supporting electromechanical\ncomponents\nwhich address design\nissues critical to space optics deployed in large space based telescopes for astronomy and for optics used in\nspaced based optical communications\nsystems.

These requirements\nare included in this report in Appendix B.\n\n5.0\n\nLightweight\n\nMirror\n\nDevelopment.\n\nAs indicated in the Introduction,\nthe primary goal of the work performed under this contract was to\nsupport the development\nof the SSD. The SSD was intended to be a prototype table-top system that could\ndemonstrate lightweight segmented mirror technologies.\nThe SSD concept included the following three\nsubassemblies;\n(1) seven segment mirror assembly, (2) mirror control/interface\nelectronics,\nand (3) system\ncontrol computer.\nThe work completed in this contract supported development\nof components\nfor the seven\nsegment mirror assembly.\nThe mirror assembly concept includes seven lightweight mirrors. Each of the seven mirrors are\ncoupled mechanically\nto a stiff baseplate using voice-coil type actuators.\nThe edge of each mirror is\n"electronically\ncoupled" to its neighbors through magnetic position sensors. The system control computer,\nusing specially developed servo/position\nalgorithms, controls the tilt and piston of the mirrors causing them\nto form a single plane surface.\nTwo of the team members,\n\nBlue Line Engineering\n\n(BLE) and Georgia\n\nTech Research\n\nInstitute\n\n(GTRI) were tasked with construction\nof lightweight mirror substrates using two different techniques.\nThe\ngoal of this development\nwas to fabricate mirrors which were optically and physically identical, using two\ndifferent approaches.\nA common goal was to produce mirror substrates that were as stress free as possible,\nlightweight, and cost effective to manufacture.\nBoth mirror substrate concepts used silicon as the material of\nchoice.\n5.1\n\nMirror Design Concept.\n\nThe BLE mirrors consist of a solid thin face-sheet and back-sheet with multiple layers of\nsilicon "snow-flakes"\nsandwiched\nbetween the face-sheet and back-sheet to provide stiffness at minimum\nadded weight. It was intended that the silicon layers would be molecularly bonded to each other to provide\nessentially a structurally stiff substrate.\nThe lightweighted\n"snow-flake"\nlayers were produced in batch\netching processes similar to processes used in the semiconductor\nindustry. The BLE mirror design is shown\nin Figure 5.1-1.\n\nFinal eport: -27657D\nR\nH\n\nShown\nsheet\n\n70 +_0.1 mm\n\nwithout\nin place\n\ny\n\n2.33 mm\n\nBack\n\nBond\n\nsheet\n\n2.73 _+O. 1 mm\n\nlines\n\nFace\nInternal\n\nFigure 5.1-1\n\nsheet\n\nsheets\n\nLightweight\n\nmirror\n\ndesign proposed\n\nby Blue Line Engineering.\n\nback\n\nFinal eport: -27657D\nR\nH\nThe\nGTRImirror esignonsists\nd\nc\nofasolid\nsubstrate\nwithcavities achined\nm\nintoone\nsurfacend\na\nathinsolid\n(except\nforsmall\nholes)\nback-sheet ismolecularly\nwhich\nbonded\n(or"glued")othemain\nt\nsubstrate.

These intense discharges remove\nmaterial from the substrate in a gradual process.\nNormally this machining technique is used with metal\nsubstrates, but for this project crystalline silicon is used as the substrate.\nTo accomplish the machining operation, a machine tool (electrode)\nis required to maintain the\nappropriate electrode-to-substrate\nrelationship and discharge pattern. A power supply is required to\nproduce the electrical discharges,\na dielectric oil is required between the electrode and substrate, and a\ncontrol system is needed to control the machining process.\nFigure 5.2-1 shows schematically\nthe various\nparts of the EDM system.\nThe electrical discharges are the result of a DC potential, provided by the power supply, applied\nacross the gap between the electrode and the substrate.\nAs the electrode is moved toward the substrate, an\nelectrode-substrate\ndistance is reached where the electric field ionizes the dielectric fluid and a discharge\noccurs. The high energy discharge produces vaporization,\nmelting, and an acoustical shock that dislodges a\nminute particle of the substrate from the workpiece, leaving a small crater. The dislodged particle or chip is\nthen solidified and washed away by the dielectric fluid. Although the chip and the crater produced by one\ndischarge is extremely small, energy pulses can be delivered to the substrate at a rate in excess of 200, 000\nper second to make the rate of material removal significant.\nThis process is illustrated in Figure 5.2-2.\nElectrical discharge machining differs from conventional\nmachining in two important respects.\nIn\nEDM only electrically conductive materials can be machined, and the cut by EDM is slightly larger than\nthe electrode (cutting tool). This extra material removal is referred to as overcut and is a result of the gap\nmaintained by between the electrode and the substrate.\nThe gap is maintained because the electrical\ndischarge always occurs where the field strength is maximum and in this case that is where the gap is\nsmallest.\nFor a constant electrode/substrate\nposition, machining will continue until a uniform gap occurs at\nall points between the electrode and the substrate. When the gap is constant, the electrode is moved closer\nto the substrate and the machining process continues.\nFeeding the electrode into the substrate is controlled\nby electrical feedback from the cutting gap. The electrode never comes into contact with the substrate.\nA\nreference voltage is established in the power supply and gap voltage is compared to the reference voltage.\nThe electronic servo controller positions the electrode relative to the substrate by controlling a valve that\ncontrols the position of a hydraulic cylinder, which in turn positions the electrode.\nThe controllable factors\nrate at which material is removed,\n\nin conventional\nmachining are present in EDM. These factors are (1) the\n(2) the finish on the substrate, (3) accuracy, and (4) the efficiency of the\n\noperation.\nIn EDM, these factors are controlled by discharge current, discharge frequency, and the\nelectrode feed system. Controls on the power supply permit regulation of the energy contained in the\ndischarges.\nBoth the total energy available for material removal (represented\nby total discharge current)\nand the numbcr of pulses per second (frequency) are controllable.\nTo help provide a controlled field environment\nbetween the electrode and substrate, a dielectric\nfluid is used. To accurately control the EDM process,\nthe dielectric fluid must initially act as an insulator\nand\n\nFinal Report: H-27657D\n\n70\xc2\xb10.1\n\nmm\n\n,_L\n_\n\n1.2\xc2\xb10.2mm-PL_\n\n1.104/1.234 mr_\n\n0.5 (+0.2/-0,1)\n\n"_1\n\n2.33 mm\n\n1"41-- 0"8+0"2mm\n\n2.33 \xc2\xb1 0.I mm\n_-_\n\nmm\n\nFigure 5.

Two types of silicon substrates were used (both were amorphous\nsilicon) in the experimental\ndevelopment\nof the EDM procedures.\nP-type silicon wafers with a resistivity of\n0.008-0.020\nohm-cm and N-type silicon wafers with a resistivity less than 1 ohm-cm were used. The\nsilicon wafers were purchased as 100 mm diameter disks, 2.33 mm thick. The disks were purchased with\nboth sides polished to a mirror finish. The supplier of the silicon wafers was asked to provide the same\npolish and flatness specification\nas is standard for the semi-conductor\nprocessing industry.\nFor the EDM process to work, both the tool electrode and the substrate must be connected to the\npower source. The normal electrical configuration\nis for the tool to be connected to the negative (-) output\nof the power source and the substrate to be connected to the positive (+) output of the power source. To\nprovide a uniform electrical connection to the silicon substrate, the substrate was attached to an aluminum\nrod with a mixture of silver conductive paint and Ducco brand cement. The paint used was SPI #5002\nHigh Purity Silver Paint for scanning electron microscopy sample preparation.\nAfter applying the\npaint/cement\nmixture to the end of the aluminum rod, the silicon wafer was placed onto the end of the rod\nand a weight was placed on top of the silicon wafer. This assembly is shown in Figure 5.3-1. After the\npaint dried, the assembly was placed onto the EDM equipment and the aluminum rod was connected to the\n(+) output of the power source.\nIn some of the original substrate assemblies, air pockets got between the substrate and aluminum\nrod. These air spaces would result in electrical discharges between the substrate and the aluminum rod,\ncausing the "back" of the wafer to be machined in those areas were air existed. It is believed that this is due\nto the relatively high resistivity of the silicon relative to the silver paint and aluminum rod, thus allowing\nlocally high field strengths in air causing the air to ionize and a discharge to occur. This was later\nminimized by placing the assembly under vacuum prior to curing.\nAnother problem that occurred in the\nfluid would dissolve the conductive paint/cement\nthe aluminum rod. This wicking action reduced\naluminum rod and the substrate could be pulled\nwould occur at the surface of the substrate.\nThe\n\nearlier stages of the project was that the EDM dielectric\nmixture and wick into the area between the substrate and\nthe mechanical bond strength between the substrate and the\noff of the aluminum rod by the tool or uneven machining\nwicking problem was solved by\n\nFinal eport: -27657D\nR\nH\n\nWeight\nFoam\n\nSilicon\n\nPad\n\nSilver Paint/Glue\n\nAluminum\n\nFigure\n\n5.3-1\n\nRod\n\nPreparation\n\nof substrate\n\nassembly.\n\nWafer\n\nFinal eport: -27657D\nR\nH\nusing\nasealant\naround\ntheoutsidedge fthesubstrate/aluminum sealant was\ne o\nrod.The\nused clear E\nG\nSilicone asshown\nII\ninFigure\n5.3-2.\nOnce\nthesubstrate\nassembly putinplace\nwas\nontheX-Ytable\noftheEDMmachine,\nthetoolwas\nalignedothatthe\ns\ntool was\nparallel\ntothesubstrate the\nand toolmotion as\nw perpendicular\ntothesubstrate.\nThen\nthetoolandsubstrate immersed\nwere\nindielectric\nfluidand machining\nthe\nprocess started.\nwas\nInitialmachining\nattempts infailure\nended\nwhen\nthetool"short\ncircuited"\ntothesubstrate the\nand\nservo\ncontroller\nsensed\nthatthetoolwas\ntouching\nthesubstrate pulled\nand\nthetoolaway\nfromthesubstrate.\nWhen\na"short ircuit" ccurred,\nc\no\namolten lobofmaterial\ng\nwould\ncause\nabridge\nbetween\nthesubstrate\nand\nthe\ntool.The\nbridge\nwould and\ncool solidify,\ncreatingsolid\na\nphysical\nconnection\nbetween\nthesubstrate\nand\ntool.When\nthetoolwas\npulled fromthesubstrate,\nback\nthesubstrate either ulled\nwas\np\noffofthealuminum\nrodorwhat suallyccurred thathesubstrate broken. igure .3-3\nu\no\nwas t\nwas\nF\n5 shows substrate\na\nbroken sa\na\nresult\nofone these\nof\n"short\ncircuit"\noccurrences.\nIt was\ntheorized the"short\nthat\ncircuits" etween\nb\nsubstrate toolwere\nand\ncaused\nbysmall ieces\np\nofconductive\nsubstrate being\ndebris\nremoved\ninthemachining\nprocess\norconductive\ncontaminates\ninthe\ndielectric\nfluid.

Based on a review of tool materials for other\napplications,\noxygen-free copper was chosen as the material for the tool. Oxygen-free\ncopper machines\neasily, provides a good finish, has high conductivity,\nis readily available, relatively inexpensive,\nand works\nwell in other EDM applications.\nThe tool represents an inverse volume to the volume that is to be removed.\nFor\nfabrication, the tool was built in several pieces and assembled into one piece.

The best effort toward a mirror substrate is shown in Figure\n5.5-1. The machining on this substrate took 54 hours due t reduced machining current and frequent raising\nof the tool for flushing. Even with these precautions,\nthe machining ended in failure due to a "short circuit"\nwhich resulted in the substrate cracking when the tool was withdrawn.\n\nFigure\n\n5.4-1\n\nPartially\n\ncompleted\n\nlightweight\n\nmirror substrate\n\n14\n\nproduced\n\nwith EDM tcchnique.\n\nFinal eport: -27657D\nR\nH\n6.0\n\nPosition\n\nSensors\n\nThe mirrors in the SSD are used to form a quasi continuous surface, with minimal wavefront\ndeviation.\nTo make the seven smaller segments look like one large mirror, the edges of the segments must\nmatch in tilt and piston (displacement).\nThe relative position of the edges of the hexagonal mirrors\nsegments are measured and this relative position is used as feedback for the servo control system.

The original SSD edge sensor design\nincluded two integrated circuit die, each one mounted on adjacent edges of a mirror as shown in Figure 6.11. As originally envisioned,\neach edge sensor circuit had the identical layout, but were interconnected\ndifferently depending on its use as a passive or active element. Each sensor pair has one passive coil pair\nand one active coil pair.\nThe sensor circuit, shown in Figure 6.1-2, contains pads for connection of two coils,\ndrive/oscillator\ncircuitry, and an array of electrical interconnect pads.\nThe sensor circuit was designed by\nSYT and fabricated by the MOSIS Fabrication Service.\nThe circuits were fabricated with two circuits per\ndie as shown in Figure 6.1-3. A total of 44 die (88 sensor circuits) were purchased by GTRI, under a\nseparate contact, for the SSD. GTRI had the task of dicing the die into two separate die, each containing\none sensor circuit. In the original sensor concept, two coils were to be attached to each circuit and the\ninterconnect\npads were to be configured using external bond wires and flex circuitry.\nThe small coils to be used with the circuits were required to have more inductance than is\nfeasible with normal integrated circuit processing techniques so a special process was employed to fabricate\nthe coil pairs. The coils were produced by the North Carolina Micro-machining\nCenter (NCMC), using the\nLIGA process.\nThe LIGA process is capable of producing miniature nickel coils that have a thickness-towidth ratio of 4 or 5 to 1 with very straight walls. This allowed the small coils to have the inductance\nnecessary for this application.\nThe LIGA coils are shown in Figure 6.1-4. The more traditional way of\nproducing similar coils in the past was by actually winding the coils with special wire on special bobbins.\nThe previous technique was very labor intense, time consuming, and produced low yields due to assembly\nproblems.\n\nIn developing the initial sensor concept, SYT had planned to have the coils fabricated by\nNCMC and the circuit dies fabricated by MOSIS Fabrication Service; then SYT would transfer and bond\nthe coils to the circuit dies to complete the sensor. However, in the design or fabrication of the coils,\nsomething went wrong and the coils were produced up-side-down.\nThis meant that the original transfer\ntechnique envisioned by SYT would not work and two transfers would be required.\nThis meant a new\ntransfer and bonding scheme would have to be developed.\n\n15\n\nFinal\n\nReport:\n\n|\n\nBack\n\nBack\n\nof Mirror\n\nBack\n\nBack\n\nof Mirror\n\nBack\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n6.1-1\n\nPosition\n\nBack\n\nBack\n\n"_\n\nl_trror Substrate\n\nFigure\n\nof Mirror\n\nof Mirror\n\nPosition Sensor\n\n/\n\n/\'x/x\n\nsensor\n\nof Mirror\n\nof Mirror\n\nPosition Sensor\n\nII r_Mirror Su\n|\nbstrate\n\nmounting\n\n16\n\non edges\n\nof mirror\n\n\xc2\xa2\n\nsubstrates.\n\nof Mirror\n\nH-27657D\n\nFinal\n\nEdge Sensor\n7\n\n8\n\n8\n\nMS 1 Rev.

These tests were inconclusive\ndue to difficulties\nencountered with the probe station. It was then decided to produce 6 packaged test devices. The circuits, as\nreceived from the MOSIS Fabrication Service, had been cut from the original wafer to allow two circuits\nper standard MOSIS die as shown in Figure 6.2-1. GTRI assembled the test devices by attaching the dual\ncircuit dies to a standard IC package (PGA84M)and\nthen wire bonding from the circuit pads to the package\nleads. The assembled test devices are shown in Figure 6.2-2.\nThe packaged circuits could then be inserted\ninto a socketed test board to test and characterize\nthe sensor circuits.\nGTRI sent the packaged sensor\ncircuits to SYT for testing with their test equipment.\nTesting at SYT indicated that the circuits were not\nusable.\n\n19\n\nFinal eport: -27657D\nR\nH\n\nFigure\n6.2-1Test ackage\np\nproduced\natGTRI howing twocircuits erdie.\ns\nthe\np\n\nFigure .2-2Test ackage\n6\np\n(PGA84M)\nshowing wires\nbond\nfromdietopackage\nleads.\n\n20\n\nFinal eport: -27657D\nR\nH\n\n7.0\n\nAlternate\n\nSensor Approach.\n\nSince the integrated sensor circuits did not work and the coils were up-side-down,\nthe team sought\nalternate approaches to producing the magnetic position sensors. The most straightforward\napproach and\nonly real alternative, due to dwindling funds and time, was to produce the sensor circuit in printed wiring\nboard format. The sensor circuits for each active sensor would be mounted off of the mirror on a printed\nwiring board to better control thermal problems and minimize mirror weight. A flex circuit would be run\nfrom the circuit board to coil pairs mounted on the edge of the mirrors. This concept is shown in Figure\n7.0-1.\nThen the only other problem was the coils. Several approaches were investigated;\nincluding having\ncoils wound the traditional way, having coils micro-machined\nfrom a solid thick film, having them made\nwith a recently developed technique that uses a very thick photo-resist\nand traditional plating techniques.\nIn\nthe end, it was decided that GTRI would attempt to salvage the original LIGA coils and develop a method\nof attaching a flex circuit to these coils and BLE would attempt to get some miniature coils hand wound.\nGTRI accepted the goal of trying to develop a packaging concept that would allow the LIGA coils to be\nmounted to the edge of the mirrors and allow attachment of a flex circuit to the coils.\nEa-I\n\nEa-2\n\nEc-2\n\nTop View\n\nflexcircuit\n\nEc-I\n\nFlex-circuit\nconnector\n\n(1 mm pitch)\n\n70 mm\nPosition\nSensor\nAttachment\nPosition\n\nPad\n\nSide View\n\nSensor\n\nflexcircuit\nFigure 7.0-1\n\nAlternate\non printed\n\npackaging concept\nwiring board.\n\nwith coils on mirror edge and sensor circuit\n\n21\n\nFinal eport: -27657D\nR\nH\n\n7.1\n\nGTRI Packaging\n\nConcept.\n\nGTRI\'s participation\nin the overall packaging concept for the SSD was initially started under a\nseparate contract in the form of a grant related to the development\nof wavefront sensor concepts for large\nspace based telescopes and many of the early designs and concepts were developed under that grant. The\ncoil packaging concept finalized in this contract is based, in part, on the earlier work.\nEarlier concepts included wire-bonding\nbetween circuit pads on silicon to circuit pads on\npolyimide (flex circuits). For various reasons, these concepts proved to be too labor intense (expensive),\ntoo fragile, or required special bonding equipment that was not standard in the industry. GTRI finally\nsettled on the design shown in Figure 7.1-1. This design is simple, robust (does not require fragile wire\nbonds), and allows a large number of prototype packages to made fairly quickly using simple fixturing.\nDetails of this packaging scheme are described in the following sections.\n\nadhesive\n\nirror substrate\n\n2 mm\n\nadhesive\n\n__circuit\n\nFigure 7.1 - !

The procedure\nwas\nto soak the coil die in a solution of I part Ammonium Hydroxide (30% assay), 1 part Hydrogen Peroxide\n(30% assay), and 6 parts deionized water. The test coil die was soaked for various lengths of time until an\noptimum was found. The optimum soak time was determined\nto be in the range of 5-6 hours. The test coil\ndie was tested by interrogating\nvarious regions of the die with the x-ray spectrum using an electron\nmicroscope at GTRI.\nAfter 3 hours of soaking, it was found that some of the sacrificial layers between the\ncoil windings had not been removed.\nAfter 6 hours of soaking some portions of the coil were loose from\nthe silicon indicating that the sacrificial layer under the coil had been removed, which was not desirable.\nIn\nthis case it was felt that it was better to error on the side of too much etching, as opposed to running the risk\nof a shorted coil, so the remaining die were etched for 6 hours to insure a low probability of shorting.\nAfter\netching of the die to remove the sacrificial layers, the die were rinsed in deionized water to stop the etching,\nand then air dried.\n7.3\n\nFlex-circuit\n\nDevelopment.\n\nAt the beginning of the project, when the sensor circuit die looked like a viable option, contact\nwas made with Nancy Holloway at NASA Langley Research Center to see if they could fabricate us some\nflex circuits using a new substrate they had developed called LaRC-SI.\nLaRC-SI is a polyimide type of\nmaterial which can be layed down in very thin layers which allows a very flexible membrane.\nInitially, the\nflex circuit designs had eight traces, as shown in Figure 7.3-1, to accommodate\nall of the power and signal\nconnections required to operate the sensor circuit. This flex circuit design and associated packaging scheme\nwas developed by GTRI under a previous contract with NASA MSFC.\nAfter it was determined\nthat the sensor circuit die did not meet our requirements\nand it was\ndecided to use the coil pair die, the flex circuit was simplified.\nThe flex circuit design for use with the coil\npair die is shown in Figure 7.3-2. This circuit required only 4 conductors to allow interconnect\nwith the two\n\n23\n\nFinal eport: -27657D\nR\nH\ncoils\nonthedie.The\nbase\ninsulating\nmaterial 0.002"hick\nwas\nt\nLARC-SI,\ntheconductive were\ntraces 200\nAngstrom tie-down with1oz.copper\nnickel\nlayer\ntracesverhenickel.The\no t\nmembrane hada\nthen\n0.0005"\nfilmofLARC-SI\noverthetopofmost ftheconductive area\no\ntrace toprotect\nagainst\nshorts.To\nallowthe\nflexcircuitobeinserted\nt\nintoaconnector,\na0.008"-0.010" Mylarstiffner as\nthick\nw bonded\nto\none ofthe\nend\nflexcircuit ithMacktacdhesive. sides fthisflexcircuitisshown Figure .3-3.\nw\na\nBoth\no\nin\n7\nTofacilitateonnection\nc\noftheflexcircuitotheprinted iringboardhatheld\nt\nw\nt\nthesensor\ncircuitry\nintherevisedoncept,\nc\naHirose\nflexcircuit onnector FH10A-8S-1SH) chosen.\nc\n(P/N\nwas\nThisconnector\naccepts\nflexcircuits ith8tracesn1mmcenter\nw\no\nspacing isattached printed iring\nand\ntothe\nw\nboard\nwith\nsurface\nmount\ntechniques.\nInourdesign,\nonlyfouroftheeightnterconnect\ni\nlocations\nareused. his\nT\ninterconnect\nscheme\nallows lowinsertion locking,\na\nforce,\ninterconnect\nthatiseasy\ntoinstall nd for\na use\nprototype\nworkthat equires\nr\nfairlyhigh\ndensity\ninterconnects flexcircuits.\nusing\n7.4\n\nCoil Pair Packaging\n\nConcept.\n\nThe packaging concept for the coil pairs is shown schematically\nin Figure 7.4-1. The coil pair\npackaging consists of a silicon die with two LIGA produced coils, a flex circuit attached to the top of the\ndie/coils with adhesive, and a means of electrically connecting the coils to the conductors of the flex\ncircuits. The electrical connections\nwere made with a conductive silver paint.

One bond\nis between the polyimide flex circuit and the nickel coils/silicon\nsubstrate.\nThe other bond is between the\nback of the coil pair silicon substrate and the edge of the silicon mirror. These bonds need to have the\nfollowing properties;\nFlex Circuit-to-Coil\n\nPair Substrate\n\n(Polyimide-to-Nickel/Silicon)\n\n1. High enough tensile/shear\nstrength so that the flex circuit does not pull off during\ninstallation and normal operation.\nThis reflects more the adhesion properties of the\nadhesive rather than the strength of the bulk adhesive material.\n2.

High enough tensile/shear\nstrength so that the coil pair assembly does not pull off\nduring installation and normal operation.\nThis reflects more the adhesion properties\nof the adhesive rather than the strength of the bulk adhesive material.\n2. Moderate cure time. The pot life should be long enough to allow time to position\n12 coil pair assemblies relative to the edge of a mirror segment, but once this is done\nyou would like to be able to cure the assembly quick enough to allow a new batch of\nassemblies to be processed.\nA pot life of 1 hour and a cure time to 80% strength,\nwith moderate heat, of 8-12 hours should be adequate.\n3. Moderate thermal expansion.\nThis parameter\nis important because this property,\ncoupled with the flexibility of the bulk adhesive, will determine how much stress is\ntransmitted to the mirror. Localized stress on the edge of mirror can cause serious\ndeformation of the surface figure of the mirror with changes in temperature.\nNo adhesive will have the low coefficient of thermal expansion of silicon, so the best\nthat can be done is to try to pick an adhesive that can flex enough to minimize the\nstress transferred to the mirror.\n4.\n\n5.\n\nHardness.\nAs stated in the previous paragraph,\nthe adhesive should be flexible\nenough to minimize the stresses transmitted\nto the mirror. However, the adhesive\ncan not be so flexible that it allows the coil pair substrate to move appreciably\ndue to\nexternal mechanical, gravitational,\nand inertial forces received during operation.\nMotion of the coil pair substrate relative to the mirror will introduce position errors\nbetween adjacent mirrors and cause wavefront distortions.\nModerate outgassing.\nAgain, this is not a very important property for the SSD, but\nwould be more important for space applications.\n\n29\n\nFinal eport: -27657D\nR\nH\nInanattempt\ntosatisfyheaboveriteria,\nt\nc\nseveral\nadhesive\nmanufacturers contacted\nwere\nandseveral\npeople\nwithexperienceoptical\nin\nfabrication assembly contacted.\nand\nwere\nAfternumerous\nconversations\nwith\nadhesive\nmanufacturersfabrication/assembly it was\nand\nexperts, concluded\nthatthe types\nbest\nofadhesives\ntotest ere\nw two-part\nepoxies, and\none two-part\nsiliconeRTV) dhesives, perhaps ofthe\n(\na\nand\nsome\ncyanocrylate\ncompounds.\nHowever,\nnomeasured were\ndata\nfound\nfortheparticular ofbonds eeded\ntypes\nn\nforthis\nassembly.\nWithout\ngood data\ntest pertaining\ntoourbondingituation, were\ns\ntests conducted\nonanumber\nofadhesives.\nThetests carried utusing\nwere\no\nsilicon\ndiesthe\nsameizeasthe\ns\ncoilpairdie,silicon\nwafer\nmaterial\nthesamesthemirrors, LARC-SI\na\nand\nflexcircuits. hesamples prepared\nT\nwere\nasshown\ninFigure\n7.5-!fortestingfthetwodifferent\no\nbonds.\nAfterthesamples\ncured,\nthetwobonds ere\nw tested yeither\nb\npulling\ntheflexcircuitrelativeothedieorpushing\nt\nonthedierelativeothe\nt\nmirror ubstrate,\ns\nasshown\nin\nFigure .5-2.Theresults these are\n7\nof\ntest shown\ninthetable\nofFigure\n7.5-3.\n\n"4\nI\n\nSilicon\nwafer\n\nSilicon\n\nrl\n\nSilic\xc2\xa2 rl coil pair die\nFlex circuit\n_\n\ncoil _\n\npair die\n\n_\n\n/\n\nFigure 7.5-1\n\nPreparation\n\nFlex circuit\n\nof samples\n\nfor testing of adhesives.\n\nPull up\n\nSilic_die,___\nPush\n\nFigure\n\n7.5-2\n\n_\n\nFlex_circuit\n\nup\n\nPull testing of samples\n\nprepared\n\n30\n\nusing different\n\nadhesives.\n\nFinal eport: -27657D\nR\nH\n\nAdhesive\n\nBonding omponents\nC\nSilicon\ntoSilicon Polyimide\ntoSilicon\n\nType\n\nDevcon,\n2-Ton,\nS-31\nDevcon,minute,\n5\nS-205\nDevcon,minute el,S-210\n5\ng\nAce, lastic onder,\nP\nB\n#17394\n3M,EC2216\nPacer,\nZap-A-Gap,\nPT-02\nGESilicone\nII\n\n2 part poxy\nE\n2 part poxy\nE\n2 part poxy\nE\n2 part poxy\nE\n2 part poxy\nE\n1part yanoacrylate\nC\nRTV\n\nGood\nGood\nGood\nPoor\nGood\nGood\nGood\n\nPoor\nPoor\nFair\nGood\nGood\nPoor\nFair\n\nFigure\n7.5-3Table\nshowing resultsfthe\nthe\no\nadhesive\npulltests\n\n7.6\nforward\n\nFabrication\n\nof Coil Assemblies.\n\nThe procedure\nfor fabrication\nand is given below;\n\nand assembly\n\nof the prototype\n\ncoil pair assemblies\n\nwas straight\n\nGlue flex-circuit to coil-pair die. This is done under a microscope\nto insure proper\nalignment of the traces with the coil pads. For the prototype units assembled for the\nSSD, the die is initially mounted to a glass slide with lacquer, the adhesive is applied to\nthe die, the flex circuit is placed over the die and positioned, the flex circuit is held in\nposition with adhesive tape until the bond cures. For the SSD, batches of 15-20 units\nwere assembled.\nFor larger quantities a special fixture would be designed to make this\nprocess for time efficient.\n2.\nLaser drilling of holes in polyimide film. After the adhesive has cured for a batch of the\nassemblies developed\nin Step 1, the batch is sent to a laser machining company for hole\ndrilling.
