Cryogenic Propellant Depots have been assessed over many years in terms of architectures, system configuration\ntrades, related technologies, economic assessments, etc., to enable more ambitious and affordable human and robotic\nexploration of the Earth Neighborhood and beyond. These activities have identified architectures and concepts that produce,\npreposition and store propellants in space for exploration and commercial space activities. Commonalities across mission\nscenarios for these architecture definitions, depot concepts, technologies, and operations were identified that also best satisfy\nthe Vision of Space Exploration.\nThe Boeing Company supported the NASA, Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) by conducting Architecture Definitions\nand Systems Studies. The primary objectives were: (1) determine high leverage propellant depot concepts and related\ntechnologies; (2) identify commonalities across mission scenarios of depot concepts, technologies, and operations; (3)\ndetermine the best depot concepts and key technology requirements and (4) identify technology development needs including\ndefinition of ground and space demonstration requirements.\nThis presentation briefly summarizes potential ground and flight experiments and demonstrations as well as discusses various\ncommercial and exploration applications of Cryogenic Propellant Depots.\n\n\\\n\n.\nr\n\ntu\n\n0\n\nu-\n\n5\n\nI\n\nN\n\nrl\n\nh\n\n81):\n\n=k\n\nrc1\nI\nI\n\n4%\n\ngh"\nk\n\ne\n\ne\n\ne\n\ne\n\n=====7=\n\ns\n0\n\nF;;\n\n5\n\nE-\n\ni\n\nQ)\n\nS\n\nE\n\n3\n0\n\nf,\ni\n\n.\nI\n\n3\n\nL\n\n.\nI\n\n3\nfn\nfn\n\n2\ne\ncv\nED\n\nT\n:\n\nI\n\nP\n\n"\n\nr;\nI\n\n\'b\n\ncn\n\n22C\n0 0\n\nL-\n\nsa,-\n\nU\n\n--a\nL1o-r\n\na\n\nP\n\n8\nhn\n\nw\n\nw\n\nCJ\n\n'
