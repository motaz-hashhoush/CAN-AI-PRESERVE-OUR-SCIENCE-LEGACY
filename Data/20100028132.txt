b'National\nAeronautics and\nSpace\nAdministration\n\nTechBrie s\n\nThe first fishing net to be manufactured by an American\ncompany in over 15 years is an outgrowth of technology\noriginally developed for crew safety nets aboard the Space\nShuttle. New fibers and twisting techniques produce a dense,\nstreamlined net that sinks rapidly. [See the bottom of page A 1.]\n\nAbout the NASA\nTechnology Utilization Program\nThe National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958, which established NASA\nand the United States civilian space program , requires that " The\nAdministration shall provide for the widest practicable and appropriate\ndissemination of information concerning its activities and the results thereof. "\nTo help carry out this objective , NASA\'s Technology Utilization (TU)\nProgram was established in 1962. Now, as an element of NASA\'s Technology\nUtilization and Industry Affairs Division, this program offers a variety of\nvaluable services to help transfer aerospace technology to nonaerospace\napplications, thus assuring American taxpayers maximum return on their\ninvestment in space research; thousands of spinoffs of NASA research have\nalready occurred in virtually every area of our economy.\nThe TU program has worked for engineers, scientists, technicians, and\nbusinessmen ; and it can work for you .\n\nNASA Tech Briefs\n\nTech Briefs is published quarterly and is free to engineers in U.S. industry\nand to other domestic technology transfer agents . It is both a currentawareness medium and a problem-solving tool. Potential products . . .\nindustrial processes ... basic and applied research ... shop and lab\ntechniques . . . computer software ... new sources of technical data . . .\nconcepts ... can be found here. The short section on New Product Ideas\nhighlights a few of the potential new products contained in this issue . The\nremainder of the volume is organized by technical category to help you\nquickly review new developments in your areas of interest. Finally, a subject\nindex makes each issue a convenient reference file .\n\nFurther Information\non Innovations\n\nAlthough some new technology announcements are complete in\nthemselves, most are backed up by Technical Support Packages (TSP\'s).\nTSP \'s are available without charge and may be ordered by simply completing\na TSP Request Card found at the back of this volume. Further information on\nsome innovations is available for a nominal fee from other sources, as\nindicated. In addition, Technology Utilization Officers at NASA Field Centers\nwill often be able to lend necessary guidance and assistance.\n\nPatent Licenses\n\nPatents have been issued to NASA on some of the inventions described,\nand patent applications have been submitted on others . Each announcement\nindicates patent status and availability of patent licenses if applicable.\n\nOther Technology\nUtilization Services\n\nTo assist engineers , industrial researchers, business executives,\nGovernment officials, and other potential users in applying space technology\nto their problems, NASA sponsors Industrial Applications Centers . Their\nservices are described on page A7 . In addition, an extensive library of\ncomputer programs is available through COSMIC, the Technology Utilization\nProgram\'s outlet for NASA-developed software.\n\nApplications Program\n\nNASA conducts applications engineering projects to help solve publicsector problems in such areas as safety, health , transportation , and\nenvironmental protection . Two applications teams, staffed by professionals\nfrom a variety of disciplines , assist in this effort by working with Federal\nagencies and health organizations to identify critical problems amenable to\nsolution by the appl ication of existing NASA technology.\n\nReader Feedback\n\nWe hope you find the information in NASA Tech Briefs useful. A readerfeedback card has been included because we want your comments and\nsuggestions on how we can further help you apply NASA innovations and\ntechnology to your needs.

The guidance\nsystem employs a digital television\n\nA10\n\ncamera and a microprocessor. It compensates for thermal expansion and intense heat at the jOint. In addition, the\nsystem uses algorithms that minimize\nthe effects of stray light reflection ,\nchanges in light level, erroneous signals,\nmomentary loss of signal, and scratches\non the workpiece.\n(See page 273.)\n\ndroplets from a spray head toward a collector.

The\ndetector element shown has six contact\ntabs for signal-output and power leads. If\nthe element were to be incorporated in\nan array, monolithic interconnections\nwould replace the tabs. Arrays with up to\n10,000 detector elements are under\nconsideration : These would be much too\nlarge to be practical if each photoresis\xc2\xb7\ntor required a pair of interconnection\nwires running to its preamplifier.\nThe device is fabricated on a wafer of\nn-type, phosphorus-doped, 3- to 5-ohmcm-resistivity <111> silicon. After fabricating a field-effect transistor (FET) on\nthe wafer and covering it with an Si02 insulating layer [leaving two windows for\ncontacting the source (S) and drain (D)\nof the FETJ, two metalization layers are\ndeposited on the wafer: first a chromium\nlayer 100 A thick, then a gold layer\n4,000 Athick.

Before deposition, a\nthickness of 30 to 50 angstroms of the\nexposed Si02 layer is etched away by\nimmersion for a few seconds in a solution of three parts water, one part\nhydrofluoric acid. This forms a fresh\nSi02 surface for nucleation and cleans\nthe metalization, all without damaging\nthe FET already formed. The wafer is\nthen immersed in a deposition solution\n\nof base-catalyzed thiourea complex until\na first coat of a mirrorlike film of lead\nsulfide forms on the wafer. The lead\nsulfide layer is built up in stages by\nrepeated cycles of water rinsing, drying,\nand deposition.\nPositive photoreSist is applied to the\nwafer; a chromium mask defining the\npattern of RD, RL, and RS is alined with\n(continued on next page)\n165\n\nthe wafer; and the photoresist is exposed through the mask. The pattern is\ndeveloped and unwanted photoresist removed. Lead sulfide not protected by\nphotoresist is etched away by a brief immersion in fresh. concentrated hydrochloric acid at 25 0 to 30 0 C. The wafer is\nthen gently rinsed in water at the same\ntemperature and dried with an inert gas.\nAcetone is used to remove the remaining photoresist.\nThe three resistors make ohmic contact with the metalization strips beneath\nthem . The resistors are sensitized to infrared radiation by brief heating and exposure to oxygen. An Si02 passivation\nlayer is then deposited over the entire\nwafer surface. followed by an opaque\n\nlayer of aluminum. The aluminum is then\nphotolithographically etched away except immediately over resistors AL and\nAS. The remaining aluminum prevents\ninfrared from reaching AL and AS. so\nthat only AD will change when the\ndevice is illuminated.\nFinally. six windows are etched\nthrough the Si02 passivation layer to expose the contact areas on the metalization layer: These allow signal-output and\npower leads to be attached.\nThe circuit configuration can be\nmodified depending on requirements:\nThe conductivity types (positive- and\nnegative-doping. depletion- or enhancement-mode) may be interchanged in the\nFET.

Heretofore, the same doping\nthat minimized noise also resulted in\nhigh resistance. Low noise is essential\nfor sensitivity in reception. and low\nresistance (interacting with the junction\ncapacitance) is necessary to maximize\nthe cutoff frequency.\nThe semiconductor portion of a conventional mixing diode (see figure) is\ncomposed of a thin n-type epitaxial layer\nof gallium arsenide, 500 to 2,500 Athick.\ngrown on a degenerately-doped n-type\nsubstrate of gallium arsenide.

By\neliminating conventional commutation\ncircuitry, the GTO reduces cost, size,\nand weight. GTO commutation is expected to be generally applicable to inverters of greater than 1-kilowatt capacity. Applications include emergency\npower, load leveling, drives for traction\nand stationary polyphase motors, and\nphotovoltaic-power conditioning.\nThe GTO is connected to a tap on an\ninput inductor that feeds an seA inverting bridge (see figure). Turning on the\nGTO causes all the seA\'s to become\nback-biased, and the required seR\'s\ncan then be turned off.\nOnly two seA\'s per phase need be\nturned on. Each seA is turned on in the\nconventional manner that is, a\npositive pulse of the appropriate duration is applied to the gate of the positiveside or negative-side SCA in the affected\nphase.\nThe commutation sequence is as\nfollows: Gate drive to the proper SCA is\nremoved (or made negative). The GTO is\nturned on with a positive current pulse to\nits gate. This action pulls tap b of\ntransformer T 1 to near-ground level.\nAutotransformer action of T1 causes leg\nc to drop below ground. This in turn\ncauses each of the seA \'s to become\nreverse-biased. The GTO remains conducting for an interval greater than the\nNASA Tech Briefs, Wlnter1983\n\nrequired SCR turnoff time. After this interval, the GTO is turned off by a\nnegative current pulse applied to its\ngate.\nSmall saturating inductors LiA and\nLiB isolate each SCR from its corresponding antiparallel diode during the\ncommutation interval. They also enable\nthe reverse seR voltage to exceed the\ndiode forward voltage drop and prevent\nexcessive currents from flowing in the\ndiode and GTO during that time.\nWinding ab of transformer T1 must\nhave enough inductance to limit the current increase through the GTO during\nthe commutation interval. The core must\nnot saturate at peak current. Winding ad\nand diode D enable energy stored in T1\nduring the commutation interval to be\nreturned to the power source when the\nGTO is turned off.\nUpon turnoff of the GTO the rate of\nvoltage rise across the GTO and seR\'s\nmust not be allowed to exceed the critical values for spurious self-triggering.\nControl of the voltage rise is provided by\na capacitor/resistor/diode "snubber"\nbetween point b and ground or point c\nand ground.\nIn industrial applications, It is often\ndesirable that a motor being driven by\nthe inverter provide negative torques\nfor dynamic braking. When the power\nsource is a battery or other bidirectional\ndevice, the circuit is adequate as shown\nin the figure. However, when power is\nderived from a unidirectional source (a\n\nbridge rectifier, for example), it is\nnecessary to divert the reverse current\nthrough an external load resistance that\ncan be connected across the inputvoltage terminals as needed.\nConventional turn-on and turnoff control algorithms may be used with the\nnew inverter. For example, the GTO may\nbe made conductive during regular intervals. The commutation of anyone or\nmore seR\'s may be performed during\n(but only during) any such interval. The\nfrequency of the Intervals may be varied\nin accordance with load voltage and current to minimize losses.\nWhenever current through a given\nseR exceeds a threshold (for example, a\nsine-wave reference), gate drive is\nremoved from that seR. Commutation\nof that seR will occur automatically during the next commutation interval.\nWhenever current In a given phase\ndrops below a second lower threshold,\nthe appropriate seR is fired (provided\nthat the opposing seA is not conducting\nat the moment).\nThis work was done by Dean B.\nEdwards and Wally E.

The circuit requires only one\ncapacitor and one inductor in its commutation circuit: It is simpler, more efficient, and more economical than conventional inverters. The principle can\nalso be adapted to dc-to-dc converters.\nThe inverter is intended for such applications as dc-to-dc converters, battery chargers, and polyphase motors. It\nprovides both commutation and control\nof the time rate of voltage change\n(dV/dt) during commutation . The FET\nhandles the main switched current during the commutation interval.\nAt the beginning o(the commutation\ninterval, a given SeR is switched off by\nsimultaneously removing the SeR gate\ndrive and applying an appropriate current pulse to the gatelcapacitor node\n(see upper part of figure). The FET is\nturned on, and both SCR \'s in an opposed pair are reverse-biased by the\nautotransformer action of inductor L1.\nAt the end of the commutation interval,\nthe FET is turned off but in such a\ngradual way that the dV/dt applied to\nthe SCR does not exceed its breakdown\nlimit. During the commutation interval,\ngate drive is maintained for the opposing SCR to keep it from turning off.\nThe FET can also be used with a pair\nof bipolar transistors (see lower part of\nfigure) to enhance switching speed and\nto improve ruggedness. The FET is\npulsed on when either transistor is turning on or off. The FET reduces switching stress on the bipolar transistors,\nwhich are susceptible to second breakdown. Since the FET is faster in switching than a bipolar transistor, switching\nloss is less. Also, since the bipolars\nhave lower saturation losses and cost\nthan do FET\'s, power losses and costs\nare less than in pure-FET circuits .\n\n168\n\n+ VIN o--------\'rv\'1(y\'\\....~------_.!.\n\nGATE o-----4~~\n\n[\n\nFIELD\xc2\xb7EFFECT\nTRANSISTOR\n\nR8URNo-------~---4\n\nSILICON CONTROLLED RECTIFIER\nINVERTER\nBIPOLAR 1\n\n-..4______-...I.\n\n+ VIN o-_ _ _ _..J"\'Y\'V"Y""......\n\n[\n\nGATE o--lIorJ\nBIPOLAR 2\nR8URN\n\n0 - - - - - - / - -.......- - - . - .\nFIELD\xc2\xb7EFFECT\nTRANSISTOR\nBIPOLAR\xc2\xb7TRANSISTOR\nINVERTER\n\nA Field-Effect Transistor can commutate either silicon controlled rectifiers or bipolar\ntransistors.\n\nThis work was done by Wally E.\nRippel and Dean B.

Both uplink and downlink\nstrips would be supported on the same\nboards. Originally proposed for the communications coverage of the continental\nUnited States for the Land Mobile Satellite System, the structure should be of in\xc2\xb7\nterest to antenna designers in other\napplications.\nTo illuminate the antenna paraboloid\nproperly and obtain low side-lobe levels,\nthe feeds associated with each beam\nhave spacings of about 2 wavelengths\nbut with apertures of about 6 wavelengths: This geometry requires that\neach beam share feed elements with adjacent beams.\n\nThe feed elements for both the uplink\nand downlink are connected to the 87\nuplink and 87 downlink cables through\nbeam\xc2\xb7forming networks on the two\nmicrostrip boards. For the downlink,\npower from each downlink cable is fed\nto a one-to-seven power divider on the\nfirst microstrip board that dispatches the\npower to the seven feed elements in a\nhexagonal array corresponding to the\ndownlink beam of that cable. On the second microstrip board (which is mounted\nin registration with the first board), a\nseven-to-one power combiner for each\nfeed element receives the power from\nthe seven beams in the hexagonal array\non the first board that share that feed\nelement. The uplink cables and feed\nelements are similarly arrayed.\nBy using a curved strip-line shape,\ndesigners were able to layout uplink and\n\ndownlink strip lines side-by-side on each\nboard. The weight of the beam-forming\nnetwork is minimized by using the same\nboards for the uplink and downlink and\nby constructing the network as a lightweight sandwich of etched circuit\nboards and dielectric honeycomb. The\narea and mass of the network are estimated at 650 ft 2 (60.4 m2) and 714 Ibm\n(324 kg), respectively.\nThis work was done by Paul W.\nCramer of Caltech for NASA\'s Jet Pro\xc2\xb7\npulsion Laboratory.

Refer to NPO-15743.\n\nFinding Open Faults in CMOS Circuits\nSpurious memory requires\na series of test inputs.\n\nNASA \'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California\nAn algorithm specifies a sequence of\ninput test signals and the interpretation\nof the resulting output signals for identifying stuck-open faults in complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS)\nintegrated logic circuits. It can be incorporated in software for online production testing of CMOS circuits .\nIn CMOS circuits, a stuck-open fault\nintroduces " memory" into the affected\ncircuit element, so that the output\ndepends on past as well as on present\ninputs. The spurious memory occurs\nbecause the output of a CMOS device\ndrives a primarily capacitive load. A\nstuck-open fault (failure of a pullup or\npulldown transistor to connect this\ncapacitance to the " 1" or " 0" reference\npotential) causes the capacitance to retain its initial charge and logic state.\nThus the test for this type of fault requires the application of a sequence of\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1983\n\ninputs to see if any spurious memory\nexists.\nThe algorithm assumes a combinatorial circuit with n inputs and one output. It specifies the following sequence\nof operations applied to the inputs:\n1. Lower all inputs to logic " 0,"\n2. Raise all inputs to logic " 1,"\n3. Lower one input to logic "0" while\nthe others are kept at logic " 1," and\n4. Repeat steps one through three,\neach time lowering a different input\nto logic " 0," until all n inputs have\nbeen tested.\nA portion of the circuit is tested each\ntime steps one through three are applied. If no fault exists, the expected output for that circuit will be observed. If\nthere is a fault, a spurious output will be\nrecorded.\nFor an example of the testing problem\nand a testing sequence, consider the\n\nCMOS NAND gate of the figure. In normal\noperation, inputs of (X1,X2> = (1 ,1) turn\noff the p transistors and turn on the n transistors, resulting in an output of F = O. If\na logic " 0" is applied to either or both of\nX1 or X2. the corresponding p transistor\nwill conduct while the corresponding n\ntransistor will not. so that F will be pulled\nup to VDD: that is. to logic " 1."\nNow suppose that there is an open\ncircuit at the point shown in the source\nline of the right p transistor. If (0,1) is applied to (X1 ,X2), then the topmost n transistor will not conduct, the left p transistor will not conduct, and the right p\ntransistor wil not conduct due to the\nfault. This isolates the F node, causing it\nto retain the previous output state. If the\nprevious input state was (0,0), then the\nprevious output state was F = 1. A mere\nexamination of the present inputs and\n(conti nued on next page)\n\n171\n\na.\n\noutputs would not reveal anyth ing\namiss. If, however, the previous input\nstate were (1,1), then the previous output would have been F\n0, and the\npresent output would still be F = 0,\nwh ich is erroneous. Thus, the fault in\nquestion could be detected by the occurence of the output F = after the input sequence (1 ,1);(0, 1). [The first step\n(0,0) of the general algorithm could have\nbeen included, but would not have made\nany difference in this case.]\n\nVDD\n(LOGIC "1" LEVEL)\n\n=\n\n\xc2\xb0\n\nOPEN CIRCUIT\n~\n\n__-+__\n\n~~\n\n____\n\n~ OUT~\n\nF\n\nThis work was done by Ramamorti\nChandramouli of Caltech for NASA\'s\nJet Propulsion Laboratory.

The\nfinal demodulator output is the logical Inverse of the data input.\n\n172\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1983\n\nA single J-K flip-flop is the heart of a\nnew digital modulator circuit. The circuit\nmodulates a square wave by turning it\non and off in response to a data signal.\nThe circuit is built with a J-K flip-flop\nfor which both outputs remain in the\' \'1"\nstate when the set and reset (S and R) inputs are in the "I" state. The CD4027 B\nflip-flop (or equivalent) has this characteristic. With the data line connected to\nthe Rand S inputs as shown in the figure,\na logic "I" on the data line raises both\nthe Q and Q outputs to logic " 1"; and\nthere is zero voltage difference across\nthe transformer primary. In other words,\na logic" 1" on the data line turns off the\ntransformer output.\nWhen the data line carries a "0" signal, the circuit functions as a normal J-K\nflip-flop. The application of a "1" to the J\ninput along with a positive-going pulse to\nthe clock input raises the Q output to\n"1" and lowers the Q output to " 0."\n\nSimilarly, a " 1" at the K input accompanied by a positive-going clock pulse\nraises Q to " 1" and lowers Q to "0." In\nthis case, the logic " I " voltages for the J\nand K inputs are provided by direct feedback from Q and Q, respectively.\nWhen the data line is at "0," the effect of a positive-going clock pulse is\nthus to reverse the logic state of the output and the polarity of the voltage difference across the transformer primary.\nSince two clock pulses are required for\none complete cycle (two reversals) of\nthe output, the transformer output is a\ntrain of pulses at half the clock\nfrequency.\nThe half-clock frequency serves, in effect, as the carrier frequency. By turning\nthe carrier on with a logic "0" and off\nwith a logic "1," the circuit modulates\nthe carrier with the logical inverse of the\ndata signal.\n\nThe data frequency should not exceed one-fourth the clock frequency or\nelse the output would not contain at\nleast one complete cycle for each data\n"0" pulse. There is also some ambiguity\nas to which output state will prevail when\nthe data Signal goes to zero before the\narrival of the next positive-going clock\npulse. The uncertainty in the output\nstarting time is one clock period at most.\nThis may be acceptable if the modulating frequency is much less than the\ncarrier frequency. The ambiguity can be\nresolved by imposing a slight delay in the\nsignal line between Rand S or by using a\nmodulating signal that is synchronized\nto the clock.\nThis work was done by Robert F. Eno\nof Rockwell International Corp. for\nJohnson Space Center.

The parts\nshould be bought in small quantities from\nmanufacturer\'s standard high-volume\nproduction lines.

The objectives of this phase\nof the study were as follows:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 To determine the effectiveness and\ncost of selected screening tests as applied to various integrated circuits and\ntransistors;\n\xe2\x80\xa2 To identify test procedures and performance or design weaknesses of specific component types;\n\xe2\x80\xa2 To determine the effects of operating\ntemperature on overall performance;\nand\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 To obtain experimental screening data\non selected devices to augment the\nfield data obtained previously.\nThe experiments were conducted with\nlow-power bipolar Schottky transistor/transistor-logic (TTL) digital circuits,\ncomplementary metal/oxide/semiconductor (CMOS) digital circuits ,\noperational-amplifier linear circuits, and\nnpn transistors. Of each type tested ,\n1,035 units were encapsulated in plastic\nand 75 units were hermetically sealed,\nto be used as a control group. The parts\nwere subjected to electrical-measurement and burn-in screening, and those\nthat survived were given 4,OOO-hour life\ntests with intermediate measurements\nat logarithmic intervals.

The findings of the first\nreport are largely contradicted by the accelerated life tests.

Developed for the reception of\ntelemetry from vehicles in deep space,\nthe SARA concept is applicable to commercial data-signal reception whenever\ntwo or more antennas are combined\nthrough diversity reception to improve\nreliability, to increase effective antenna\narea, or to allow increased coverage\ntime of a moving transmitter. Computer\nsimulations predict that SARA\'s will increase the apparent bit power over that\nattainable in other systems.\nThe SARA concept offers improved\nperformance particularly at high modulation indices. A SARA system is operated as a " master/slave" system. Either\n180\n\na conventional tracking loop or a suppressed-carrier tracking loop may be\nused in the master channel to demodulate the carrier. A suppressed-carrier\nloop will yield better performance in\nmost cases .\nThe master channel is associated\nwith the largest antenna in the array, in\nwhich the signal-to-noise ratio is largest.\nThe slave receivers contain conventional tracking loops that are aided by\nthe subcarrier and data estimates derived in the master channel (see figure).\nThese are relatively low-frequency, lowbandwidth signals that can be transmitted digitally to the slave receivers over\nexisting microwave radio links.\nEach slave receiver includes circuits\nfor the proper alinement of its modula-\n\ntion with the modulation estimate it\nreceives from the master receiver. This\n" aiding " allows the slave receivers to\ntrack the sideband power (rather than\nthe carrier power) with losses that are\nlower than they would be in a system\nwith separate suppressed-carrier loops\nin each slave receiver. The demodulated\nbaseband Signals from the master and\nall slaves are combined in a baseband\ncombiner.\nTwo effects account for the superior\nperformance afforded by a SARA\nsystem:\n- It can operate in a suppressed-carrier\nenvironment. For example, while the\nmodulation index of one alternative\nnon-suppressed-carrier scheme for a\nUranus mission is 76 0 , a SARA system\nNASA Tech Briefs, Wklter1983\n\ncan operate at an index of 90 o. This\nresults in an increase of 6 percent in\nthe apparent data power.\n- SARA signals exhibit lower radio loss\nthan that of other systems. The sideband aiding in both the master receiver\nand the slave receivers greatly increases the receiver-loop signal-tonoise ratios over those of conventional\nphase-locked loops. A greater signalto-noise ratio results in smaller phase\njitter and better tracking .\n\nA further advantage of the SARA concept is that it can be effected with only\nsmall modifications to existing hardware. In NASA\'s deep-space receiving\nnetwork, for example, a slave receiver\ncan be an existing receiver with a mixer\nadded for sideband aiding. An existing\nreceiver can be used for the master\nreceiver if modulation estimates are\ntaken from the subcarrier-demodulation\nassembly and the symbol-synchronizer\nassembly. The modulation can be sent\n\nto the slave receivers over existing\nmicrowave links, which can be alined\nwith the modulations in the slave\nreceivers by reprogramed real-time\ncombiners.\nThis work was done by Stanley A.\nButman, Leslie J.

By monitoring the\nantenna Doppler spectrum and echo\nsignals the technique would enable continuous examination of the antenna stability and would provide the information\nfor correcting deformations.\nIn the new method, the antenna array\nis electrically divided into several subarrays as shown in the figure. The Doppler spectrum of each subarray is obtained, using a pulse repetition frequency consistent with the expected\nwidth of the Doppler spectrum of that\nsubarray. The received signal is spectrum-analyzed in the along track dimension. The spectrum exhibits a pattern\nthat corresponds to the radiation pattern\nof that subarray. If there is an angular\ndeformation of one subarray relative to\nanother, the observed Doppler spectra\nfor the two subarrays will be shifted\nrelative to each other.\nAlthough the accuracy of the measurements of these shifts has not been\ndirectly evaluated, data from spaceborne synthetic-aperture-radar observations indicate that a deformation of 1\npercent of the wavelength from one end\nof the subarray to the other is detectable.

The system would enable the antenna to maintain a desired fixed gain\npattern automatically. The principal use\nwould be in focusing large phased arrays for radar or pOint-to-point communications.\nThe phasing system would ordinarily\nbe used with a nominally planar array of\nactive antenna elements, shown in\nsimplified form as a linear array in the\nfigure. The normal operation of the\nantenna would be interrupted periodically for calibration intervals during which\nthe phase measurements would be performed and compensating factors\ncalculated.\nDuring a calibration interval the central feed transmits a continuous, coherent signal to the feed ports of the active antenna elements. At first, the\nphase shifter in each active element is\nset at the ideal value, assuming no structure deformation and component drift.\nThen, in a series of discrete time steps,\nthe phase controller advances the\nphase of each element by a different\nrate. For a portion of the calibration period, a microwave short-circuit switch is\nturned on between the phase shifter and\nthe amplifiers in each active element.\nWhen the short-circuit switch is off,\npart of the outgoing signal energy leaks\nthrough the Circulator, is amplified by\nthe receiving preamplifier, and is returned through the directional coupler to\nthe phase shifter. When the short-circuit\nswitch is on, the outgoing signal is reflected at the switch so that the activeelement electronics beyond the phase\nshifter have no effect. In both switch\nmodes, the reflected energy passes\nback through the feed system to the central feed and from there to the synchronous receiver.\nThe distinct phase-shift rate of each\nelement imposes a distinct frequency\nmodulation on the signal returned to the\nreceiver from that element. In the\nreceiver, the demodulated Signals are\nsampled at time steps synchronous with\nthose of the phase shifts, and the samples are fed to the Fourier-transform\n182\n\nRADIATOR\nELECTRONICS\n\n"\n\n--- ",\n\n./\n\n./\n\n",\n\n./\n\nFOURIERTRANSFORM\nPROCESSING\nSYSTEM\n\n./\n\nSYNCHRONIZATION FOR\nSAMPLE ACQUISITION\n\nCALIBRATION\nMODE CONTROL\n\n- - --- ------,\nCIRCULATOR\n\nI\n\nI\n\nFEED\nPORT\n\nRECEIVING\n\nANTENNA\nELEMENT\n\nI\n\nPREAMPLIFIER\n_ _ _ _ _ _ ----.JI\n\n\'1\',\n\nRADIATOR ELECTRONICS\n(ONE OF N UNITS)\n\nThe Automatic PhaSing System periodically interrupts the antenna operation for calibration intervals during which it measures the phase and amplitude response at each active\nantenna element.

A proposed calculator (see figure) would implement an algorithm that generates such interstitial\npoints using a four-by-four array of convolute integer coefficients. These coefficients are multiplied by the intensities at\nthe 16 original image points nearest\neach interstice to obtain a weighted average intensity at each interstice. [See\nalso "Digital Filters for Two-Dimensional\nData" (MFS\xc2\xb725790) on page 481 of NASA\nTech Briefs, Vol. 7, No. 4 (Summer\n1983).]\nThe method is equivalent to fitting a\nsurface to the image data by a regression calculation . Since the data and the\ncoefficients are integers, only integer\nmultiplications are required, making the\ncalculation faster than if floating-point\nmultiplications were required. The calculation is . further simplified and\nspeeded by taking advantage of the\nsymmetry of the coefficients about the\ncenter and diagonals of the array: Only\nthree independent coefficients are\nneeded for the four-by-four array, and\nthe number of multiplications is therefore reduced by first adding the intensities that are to be multiplied by the same\ncoefficient.\nAfter completing one pass over the\nentire original data array with the interstitial-point generator, an interstitial\npoint will have been calculated at the\ncenter of each square of 16 adjacent\ndata points (except along the perimeter\nof the array). In the interior of the array\nthe number of points per unit area is\ndoubled: Half of the points are the\noriginal data ; and half, the newlycalculated interstitial points. The apparent resolution will have increased by\na factor of v2.\nBy processing the resulting array a\nsecond time with the coordinate axes\nrotated by 45\xc2\xb0, the number of points can\nbe doubled again, producing an array\nwith four times as many columns and\nrows per unit distance as the original array. The apparent resolution is thus\n,\n\n(continued on next page)\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, Wlnter1983\n\nAOWICOLUMN _\n\n- 2\n\n- 1\n\n- 2\n\nDIGITAL\xc2\xb7INPUT\nINTENSITY\nVALUES\n\n- 1\n\n..\n\nCOLUM N N UMBERS\n\nr\n- 2\n\n- 1\n\n2\n\n,\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\ne\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n- 1\n\n3\n\n3\n\n- 1\n\n\xc2\xae\n\n\xc2\xae\n\n\xc2\xae\n\n\xc2\xae\n\n3\n\n13\n\n13\n\n3\n\n\xc2\xae\n\n\xc2\xae\n\n\xc2\xae\n\n\xc2\xae\n\n3\n\n13\n\n13\n\n3\n\n\xc2\xae\n\n\xc2\xae\n\n\xc2\xae\n\n\xc2\xae\n\n- 1\n\n3\n\n3\n\n-1\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xc2\xae\n\n\xc2\xae\n\n\xc2\xae\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n- 2 \xe2\x80\xa2\n\n- 1 \xe2\x80\xa2\n\n1 \xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nen\na:\nw\n\nCD\n\n::!\n\n2 \xe2\x80\xa2\n\nJ\nZ\n\n~\n\n0\n\na:\n\nX\n\nThe Interstitial-Point GeneratOf\' estimates the value of the data at the point In the center of\neach four-by-four subarray.

An instrumented platform of this type could also\nbe used for undersea mining and for detailed surveys of underwater routes for\ncables and pipelines.\nThe platform is towed and operated\nfrom a ship by an armored coaxial cable\nthat carries power and two-way communications. Based on spacecraft\ndigital communication concepts, the\nplatform data link transmits 250,000 bits\nof data per second to the Ship. A van on\nthe ship houses the platform depth control data processing, display, and recording facilities.\nAt present, the platform (see figure)\ncarries the digital and analog circuitry for\nside-looking sonar in a steel hull capable\nof withstanding 10,000 p~i (69 MPa).\nWith modular equipment compartments\nand common data buses, the platform\ncan readily accept additional electronics\npackages. The side-looking sonars\ncreate images of the contours and texture of the ocean floor. Objects up to 500\nmeters away can be detected and\ndisplayed with a range resolution of 0.75\nmeter.\nThe side-looking sonar transducers\nsend and receive acoustic signals, under\ncomputer control, in a narrow, fanshaped beam that starts out about 1\nmeter wide and diverges three-fourths\ndegree in the horizontal plane.

Such an algorithm has\nbeen used in a star-tracking telescope to\nprevent the false interpretation of " hotspots" (picture elements of unusually\nhigh dark current) as stars. Since even\nthe best ceo \'s usually have at least a\ndozen hotspots apiece, this method of\ndefect compensation should be of interest in automatic navigation systems,\nrobotics, image enhancement, image\nanalysis, and digital television.\nIn the star-tracking application the\nlens is deliberately defocused by a small\namount so that the light from one star\nfalls on as many as nine picture\nelements without the risk of being lost in\nthe interstices. The luminous flux density\nis reduced by the defocusing to such an\nextent that the hotspot dark currents\noften exceed the currents excited by\nstars. In a typical system that tracks the\nten or so brightest stars, a hotspot can\nbe mistaken for one of the stars (see\nfigure).\nTo compensate, ,he telescope computer memory is equipped with a "spot\ntable" that lists the locations of the\n\n" HOTSPOTS"\n(FALSE STAR IMAGES)\n\n"HOTSPOTS"\n(FALSE STAR IMAGES)\n\nTRUE STAR\nIMAGES\nSTAR.TRACKING TELESCOPE\nCCD OUTPUT\n(SHUTTER CLOSED)\n\nSTAR\xc2\xb7TRACKI NG TELESCOPE\nCCD OUTPUT\n(SHUTTER OPEN)\n\n" Hotspots" (picture elements with high dark current) are identified by scanning the CCO\nwithout illumination (left).

Commercially-available\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1983\n\nlogic probes can detect floating inputs,\nbut for some applications it may be\npreferable to have a full oscilloscope\ndisplay, rather than just the LEO readout\nof typical logic probes.\nThe probe is modified with a subminiature momentary pushbutton switch and\na resistor connected to the springloaded probe tip (see figure). The only\npermanent change in the probe is a\n0.020-in. (0.5-mm) hole in the tip. This\n\nhole accepts a contact pin held in place\nby the spring tension of the tip.\nA 1/4-W resistor, 5 to 6 kQ for CMOS\nlogic circuits, is soldered between the\ncontact pin and one side of the switch.\nThe switch is mounted in a screw of a\nstandard cable clamp that encircles the\nprobe housing. The other side of the\nswitch is connected to a short lead terminated by an alligator clip or other con(continued on next page)\n\n185\n\nvenient termination . The modified tip is\ninserted into the probe housing.\nDuring the tests, the alligator clip is\nclamped to the circuit supply voltage;\nthe circuit nodes are probed with the tip.\nWhen a node is suspected of being in a\nfloating or tristate condition , the pushbutton switch is pressed to apply a\nmomentary pullup voltage, and the\nscope is observed to determine if the\ntrace moves from ground to the logic\nsupply level. If the trace does not move,\nthe node is grounded. If the trace "tries"\nto move, the node is held at a logic low\nby a driving gate and is not floating . The\nswitch thus uncovers the floating inputs;\nit draws less than 2 mA of circuit current.\nThis work was done by Bob Cash and\nMichael G.

Furthermore, diffraction limits the resolution at pinhole\nsizes comparable to visible-light-wavelengths. The resolution is further limited\nby screens 01 and 02.\nIn the improved system (see Figure 2),\nthe degrading effects of S\' and 02 are\neliminated. To avoid a further loss of image information, the first generation of\nintensified visible-light pinhole images is\noptically projected or coupled by imaging fiber optics to a digitizing camera.\nM example of a suitable camera would\nbe one with a charge-coupled-device array, the digital output of which specifies\nthe location and intensity of each picture\nelement. The picture-element size must\nbe small enough for adequate resolution\nof the pinhole images.\nThe digital camera output is sent to a\ndata-processing system, which digitally\n\ninverts each pinhole image about its\npinhole axis: The digital system thus performs the geometric inversion formerly\ndone by S\' and 02 but without the loss of\nresolution. The image data may then be\nstored, subjected to digital image\nenhancement or other processing, or\nconverted back to analog form on a\ntelevision screen or other display\ndevice.\nThe display is viewed through a viewing screen S", which could be an array\nof pinholes of geometry similar to that of\nthe first pinhole array, S. For greater\nbrightness and resolution, the viewing\nscreen could consist of a planar array of\nsmall lenses in place of the pinholes. The\nlateral alinement, pinhole or lens spacing, and optical distance from the\ndisplay terminal may be similar to those\nof screen S in relation to the scintillator,\nwith all dimensions multiplied by the\noverall magnification or minification\nintroduced by the electronic-image-\n\nprocessing and optical-coupling portions\nof the system. If desired, an exaggerated sensation of depth can be obtained by disproportionately increasing\nthe distance from the display terminal to\nthe viewing screen .\nIn addition to analog 3-~ viewing, the\ndigitized information from the detector\ncan be used to produce quantitative\ntomograms of the object. Image digitization also allows the visualization of X-ray\nand gamma-ray objects of very low intensity through long integration times.\nThis work was done by Lo I.

The\nlight would be transmitted over optical\nfibers, with the fiber from each source\nterminating at a fixed designated position along the slit. Thus , the spectra of\nthe several point sources would be\ndisplayed simultaneously, with each\nsource identified by its position along the\naxis perpendicular to the wavelength\naxis of the spectrogram. The concept\nwas originally developed to enhance the\nefficiency of spectrographs on astronomical telescopes by allowing the\nspectrograph to view many objects in\nthe sky simultaneously.\nAccording to the concept , one end of\neach of 20 optical fibers would be\ncomputer-controlled to move to preset\nlocations in the focal plane of the\ntelescope. The major technical difficulty\nis precisely moving the fibers and setting\ntheir positions in a confined area: The 20\nfibers must be moved within a square\n3 inches (7 .6 cm) on a side, and their\npositions must be correct within 20 101m.\nThe proposed solution involves dividing\nthe square field into 10 strips and placing\ntwo movable fibers in each strip (see\nfigure). The fibers, which are to be\nmoved by stepping-motor-driven lead\nscrews, may be placed anywhere in their\nstrip provided that each fiber does not\npass the other fiber occupying the strip.\nTo test the concept, a prototype consisting of a single strip with two fibers\nwas constructed and tested on the 200\n\n194\n\nSPECTROGRAPH\nIn a Telescope Field divided Into 10 strips, 10 pairs of optical fibers are moved laterally and\nlongitudinally to any required position in their assigned strips.

The fibers are moved by\nmanual commands to the stepping\nmotors. Measurements with the prototype showed that light losses th rough the\nfibers are small and that the performance (in terms of ability to respond to\nlow light levels) comes up to about half\nthat of the original spectrograph.\nIn the prototype, both motions of a\nfiber - longitudinal and lateral - are\ndriven through lead screws by 90 0\npermanent-magnet stepping motors.\nThe lead-screw pitch is 52 to the inch\n(about 20.5 to the centimeter). This pitch ,\n\ncombined with the 6-to-1 gear ratio on\nthe motors, gives the requisite 20-loIm increment per step.

A visible\nHeINe laser beam is substituted for the\ninvisible CO2 beam during the aline\xc2\xb7\nmen!. The new method could also be\nused to aline adjacent telescopes in\nother optical systems.\nThe key to the new method is the addition of a low-power HeINe laser coaxial\nwith the transmitter CO2 infrared laser\n(see figure). During the alinement of the\nsystem, the CO2 laser is turned off, and\na corner-cube reflector is placed just in\nfront of the two telescopes to divert a\nsample of the HeINe laser beam into the\nreceiver telescope . The corner-cube reflector is precisely constructed so that\nthe return beam reflected from it is parallel to the incident beam to within 2 arcseconds. The return beam is imaged on\nthe infrared detector or other imaging\nsurface at the focal plane of the receiver\ntelescope, appearing as a tiny bright red\nspot superimposed on the image of the\ndistant target scene .\nThe first step in the alinement procedure is to set the receiver and transmitter as nearly parallel as possible and\nclamp the telescope structures to prevent relative motion. Next, the telescope\npai r is aimed so that image of the distant\ntarget falls within the field of view of the\nreceiver. The corner-cube reflector is\nthen placed in front of the two telescopes and the HeINe laser turned on .\n\nFROM~5=D--- )-==~~\nC02 AND\nLASERS\nHeiNe\n\nTARGET\n\n"\n\n~ ~\nLONG DISTANCE\n(SEVERAL km)\n\nThe Allnement of a LlDAR System can be accomplished visually by using a low-power\nHeiNe laser that has been previously adjusted so that its visible beam is parallel to the invisible infrared C02 laser beam.\n\nThe aim of the transmitter telescope is\nthen adjusted to bring the red spot image into coincidence with the image of\nthe distant target. The alinement is completed by adjusting the position of the infrared detector, such that the red spot\nimage is coincident with it. (An alternative sequence of these steps may sometimes be preferable, depending on the\noptical configuration.)\nDue to the slight divergence of the\noutgoing CO2 laser beam, the finite resolution of the receiver telescope, the\nlarge distance to the target, and the\nfinite area of the infrared detector, the\ndetector will "see" the radiation backscattered from the target region even\nthough the axes of the two optical systems have been alined to be parallel to\n\neach other rather than to converge to\none point on the distant target. That is,\nthe effective diameter of both the transmitter beam at the target and the target\nregion sensed by the receiver are large\ncompared to the distance between the\naxes of the two telescopes.\nThe adequacy of the alinement procedure was demonstrated experimentally:\nA return beam of adequate strength was\ndetected from a reflecting target at\ndistances up to 2 km from the\ninstruments.\nThis work was done by Robert T.\nMenzies and Uri P.

The flow into cavity B\nconstitutes the " air door" across the\naperture, preventing the entrance and\nexit of convection currents and preventing the formation of parasitic convec\xc2\xb7\ntion currents within the receiver . Since\nthe aperture is not otherwise blocked,\nthe internal pressure of the aircirculation system automatically adjusts\nto changes in ambient pressure.

The modified\ntracker can operate unattended for a\nyear before it needs corrections.

The Scotch yoke is a\nsimple mechanical device and is not Sun\nseeking; it is therefore inexpensive and\nreliable - even on overcast days.\nThe solar period is approximated in\nthe tracker by a 360-day cycle - a\nperiod that is less costly to provide than\nthe true 365-day cycle.

This gear is on\nthe shaft of a single-thread worm that\nmeshes with a 72-tooth gear - a stock\ngear that is less expensive than a\ncustom-made 73-tooth gear would be.\nThe drive mechanism is adjusted for a\nbest average fit by setting it so that its\nmotion lags that of the Sun by 21/4 days\nat the beginning solstice, leads the Sun\'s\nmotion by one-fourth day at the middle\nsolstice, and leads the end solstice by 2\n314 days. The equinox timing is thus off\n\nby about a day, and the complete\ndeclination-follower cycle is 5 days short\nof a year - hence the need for yearly\nadjustment.\nSo that sliprings would not be needed\nfor electrical connections, the tracker\nreverses its direction after Sunset and\nturns back toward the Sunrise position\nat a higher speed, since in the summer a\nshorter time is available for the nighttime\nreturn .

It is currently used by NASA for research on jet flames and produces a\nclearly identifiable and measurable variation of the acoustic spectral intensities\nalong the length of a flame .\nThe reflector concentrates energy\noriginating at its far focus into a microphone at its near focus (see figure).\nThus , when the reflector is positioned\nwith its far focus in the jet flame, the microphone receives sound predominantly\nfrom a small region around that point in\nthe flame. The reflector can be scanned\nalong the flame so thC\\t it measures the\nacoustic spatial and spectral distributions.\nThe size of the region that contributes\nappreciably to the sound level at the microphone decreases with frequency increase. The resolution is determined by\nthe diffraction pattern at the image\nplane.

The final product, ZnS04\xc2\xb7H20, is removed by\nevaporating part of solution A until the product crystallizes out.\n\nA countercurrent batch chemical\nprocess has been suggested for the extraction of zinc from discarded tires. The\nzinc (incorporated as zinc oxide in tire\ntreads) would be recovered as\nlnS04\xc2\xb7H20, which can be sold as a fertilizer or for general use.\nA strong acid is required to break up\nthe ZnS that forms in the tire by the reaction of colloidal Zno with sulfur. In the\nproposed recovery process, sulfuric\nacid would be used in three different\nconcentrations (see figure). First, the\ntires would be shredded and the\nresulting material placed in solution A\n(the most concentrated). After steeping\nin solution A, the material would be\nsteeped in solution B (of intermediate\nconcentration) and then in solution C\n(the most dilute).\nAt each stage the acid content must\nexceed the zinc content anticipated at\nthe end of steeping in order to have a\nchemical driving force for the extraction.\nThe chemical cost is dictated by the\namount of excess. When the solution of\nthe last stage (solution C) is as dilute as\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter1983\n\npracticable, a minimum of acid and zinc\nwill be irretrievably discarded with the\nrubber: This maximizes zinc recovery\nand minimizes the cost of makeup acid.\nWhen the rubber is transferred to the\nnext, more dilute solution, it carries\nsome of the more concentrated acid\nand zinc extract with it, thus enriching\nthe solution of the next stage. To prevent\nthe gradual enrichment of solution C,\nsome of this solution is transferred at intervals to stage B while fresh dilute acid\nis added. Similarly, the enrichment of\nsolution B is prevented by transferring\nsome of it to stage A, while a portion of\nsolution C is transferred in along with\nsome fresh acid.\nSome of solution A is removed for\nfinal product extraction and replaced by\nthe portion of solution transferred from\nstage B plus some fresh acid. The removed portion of solution A is concentrated by solar-assisted evaporation.\nThe evaporation continues until lnS04\'\nH20 crystallizes out, leaving excess\nacid and some zinc extract in the mother\nliquor. The zinc sulfate is removed and\n\nsold, while the mother liquor is diluted\nand recycled to solution A with fresh\nacid. Such a crystallization process is\nnow used in the manufacture of zinc\nsulfate.\nDepending on the grade of ZnS04\n\xc2\xb7H20 , the product could be sold for 50\xc2\xa2\nto 75\xc2\xa2 per Ib ($1.10 to $1 .65 per kg),\n1980 prices. The cost of recovery has\nbeen estimated at 5.7\xc2\xa2 to 7.7\xc2\xa2 per Ib\n(12.6\xc2\xa2 to 17.0\xc2\xa2 per kg) of In . This\nestimate is, however, based on the\nassumption that some other end use will\npay for most or all of the cost of shredding the tires. The cost of shredding\nwould otherwise make the recovery of\nzinc uneconomical. Suitable uses for the\nextracted shredded tires would include\nincorporation in asphalt topping for road\nsurfaces and pyrolysis to produce motor\nfuel and coke.\nThis work was done by Eugene R.\ndu Fresne of Caltech for NASA\'s Jet\nPropulsion Laboratory.

The\n\nbed eliminates most of the vapors remaining after the wet treatments.\n\nBeds of activated alumina have been\nfound effective as filters to remove\nhypergolic vapors from gas streams. The\nbeds absorb such substances as\nnitrogen oxides and hydrazines. They\nmay also absorb acetylene, ethylene,\nhydrogen suHide , benzene, butadiene,\nbutene, styrene. toluene, and xylene.\nPurification by activated alumina particles offers many advantages. The bed\nhas no moving parts, such as pumps,\nblowers, and mixers, and is therefore\nreliable and energy-conservative. Activated alumina is inexpensive, nontoxic,\nand easy to handle. The bed can be\nreadily adapted to any size, from small\nportable units for use where little vapor\nrelease is expected to large stationary\nunits for extensive transfer operations.\nThe alumina-bed method was developed to eliminate poisonous vapor discharges that occur when hypergolic\nfuels and oxidizers for the Space Shuttle\nare transferred. Air laden with the vapors\nis passed through conventional countercurrent wet scrubbers and bubblers , but\nsome of the harmful materials remain. A\n206\n\npacked bed of activated alumina was\nfound to remove most of the remaining\nvapors (see figure).\nThe fuel (for example, hydrazine,\nN2H4) and the oxidizer (dinitrogen\ntetroxide , N204) must be treated differently. Activated alumina can be used as\ndelivered to absorb oxidizer vapor. However, the activated alumina is first soaked\nin sulfuric acid before it is used to treat\nfuel vapor, which requires an acidic\nmedium.\nLaboratory tests were performed with\na clear acrylic tower, 22 inches (56 cm)\nhigh and 3.5 inches (8 .9 cm) in diameter,\ncontaining 9.6 pounds (4.4 kg) of activated alumina. The alumina particles ranged in size from 0.5 inch (13 mm) at the\nbottom to a coarse powder at the top.\nHelium bearing the fuel or oxidizer\nvapors flowed through the tower at a\nrate of 5.4 liters per minute.\nIn the tests, the average efficiency of\nfuel removal was 72 percent for inlet\nconcentrations from 1 to 100 ppm.\nOxidizer-removal efficiency was 45 per-\n\ncent for inlet concentrations ranging\nfrom 3 to 1,194 ppm.\nThe absorption capacity of the bed for\nN204 oxidizer is at least 0.0007 Ib per\npound (0.7 g per kilogram) of bed\nmaterial. The oxidizer-absorption bed\ncan be regenerated in place by washing\nwith a dilute sodium hydroxide solution.\nThe ability of the bed to absorb fuel\ndecreases gradually rather than sharply\nas in oxidizer absorption. The fuelabsorption bed can be rejuvenated by\nwashing with sodium hypochlorite solution . The hydrochloric acid thus\ngenerated restores the acidity needed\nfor fuel absorption.\nThis work was done by John J.\nThomas and David M.

The addition of\nsmall amounts of vanadium compounds\nto some epoxy resins has been found to\npromote such char formation.\nNormally, when epoxy foams are exposed to high heat fluxes or flames, they\nmelt before they char. Chopped fibers of\nasbestos can be added to foams to increase their melt resistance. Fiber additives, however, increase the weight of a\nfoam. Alternatively, high-temperaturecuring resins can be used. However,\nthese resins must be cured in an oven ,\n\nand the maximum size of a foam part is\nlimited by the size of the available oven.\nCured epoxy foam samples were\ntreated with methylene chloride solutions of vanadium acetylacetonate,\nvanadyl acetylacetonate, and vanadium\ntrisacetylacetonate. In each case, about\n2 percent by weight of the vanadium\ncompound was added to the foam sample. When solvent was removed from the\nblocks of foam , much of the additive bled\nback to the top surface. The first two additives did not change the response of\nthe foam to a propane torch : The foam\nmelted. However, the latter two additives\n\ninhibited melting, and the foam merely\ncharred under the torch .\nWhether the action of vanadium com\xc2\xb7\npounds is specific to the epoxy resin\nused in the test or whether specific types\nof vanadium compounds are applicable\nto a range of epoxies is not yet known .

However, above about 900 0 F\n(480 0 C), these materials oxidize rapidly\nunless they are coated with oxidationresistant materials. Most commercially\navailable coatings are based on\nchemical-vapor deposition (CVO) processes, which require specialized equipment to produce a sil icon carbide (SiC)\nouter layer.\nThe process described here also produces an oxidation-resistant SiC outer\nlayer; but it may be produced more easily, using only a paint sprayer and a conventional vacuum furnace. Fine nickel\nand silicon powders are blended in\nproper proportions, mixed with nitrocellulose lacquer, and sprayed on the\ngraphite parts to be coated. The coatings are air-dried and vacuum-fused at\n\n208\n\nCa)\n\nThe Microstructure of a Fused Nickel and Silicon Siuny Coating on a graphite substrate is\nshown here. In the cross section (magnified 500 x) of a silicon and silicon carbide reaction\nzone (a), a top layer of silicon adheres to the silicon carbide layer.

A top surface\nof silicon (see figure), which has a\nmetallic luster may also exist. Upon exposure to air at high temperature, the Si\n+ SiC coating protects the graphite part\nfrom catastrophic oxidation by forming\nan impervious slow-growing silicon dioxide (Si02) surface scale.\nPreliminary 2,200 0 F cyclic oxidation\ntests showed that the coatings themselves are very oxidation resistant and\n\nprotected the graphite for about 5 to 10\nhours. Uncoated graphite by comparison was totally consumed by oxidation after only 5 hours at 2,200 0 F.\nHowever,localized coating infiltration of\nthe excessive porosity in the graphite reo\nsuited in premature oxidation of the substrate. Use of less-porous carbon/carbon composite substrates will produce\nmore protective coatings.\nIt is expected that these materials and\ncoatings could find application in areas\nwhere short exposures to high-temperature oxidative gases are experienced.\n\nThe fused-slurry process offers some\nflexibility over conventional CVD processing in terms of coating composition\nand localized application. The process\nmay be especially useful in coating\nrepair.\nThis work was done by James L.\nSmialek of Lewis Research Center.

In contrast,\nolder formulations contain organic\nbinders that degrade above 500 0 to\n600 0 F (260 0 to 316 0 C). The coating\nhelps to prevent excessive solar\nheating of spacecraft or other objects\nat moderate operating temperatures,\ntypically room temperature to 150 0 F\n(66 0 C).

It is a sintered highsilica glass containing particles of 1- to\n4-mm size. The particles scatter radiation at wavelengths of 0.35 to 2.3 j.jm\nwhile permitting longer wavelengths to\npass. The high silica content also gives\nthis layer a low thermal-expansion coefficient that helps to minimize the\ngeneration of residual thermal stresses\nduring fabrication.\nThe coating layers are prepared as\nwaterlalcohol slurries and sprayed in\nturn onto the fibrous insulating tile.\nAfter drying for a few hours at or slightly\n\nabove room temperature, the coated\ntile is glazed in a furnace for 1 to 2\nhours at 1,092 0 to 1,231 0 C.

The Inner Tube of the bubble\ngenerator nozzle feeds the gas at the\ndesired pressure. To form a 7\xc2\xb7mm bubble,\nfor example, from molten tin, the gas\nvelocity is between 1.5 and 4.0 mIs, and\nthe tin flows at 1.0 mls through the an\xc2\xb7\nnular gap.\n\nThe bubbles are formed in a compart\xc2\xb7\nment that receives the molten material\nand the compressed gas that fills the\nbubbles. The compartment has a matrix\nof nozzles. The matrix can be almost any\ndimension, and the nozzles are sized for\nthe desired material density or bubble\nsize. After leaving the nozzles, the bub\xc2\xb7\nbles fall into an acoustic chamber,\nwhere they coalesce. They then drop\nthrough a funnel and are cast into the\ndesired shape by extrusion or molding.\nThe outer shell of each nozzle (see\nFigure 1) is a container, which holds the\nliquefied material, with a 4\xc2\xb7mm opening\nat the bottom. A tube 2.5 mm in diameter, which feeds the gas for the bubbles,\npasses through the container along its\naxis and extends through the opening.\nThe amount that the tube protrudes out\nof the container depends on the viscosity of the liquefied material and the\nvelocity of the gas from the tube.\nMetallic bubbles are kept in a semimolten state while they are extruded or\nmolded inside an oven. For plastics, such\nas epoxies and polymers, no oven is\nneeded, and the coalescing is assisted\nby chemical interaction or electrostatic\nattraction.\nThe foamed materials have very high\nstrength-to-weight ratios and have\nuniform elastic moduli throughout\nbecause of the uniformity of the spheres\n\nproduced by preciSion nozzles. The density of the material is controlled by the\nbubble size, which can range between\n0.5 mm and 1 cm in diameter and can be\ncontrolled within 1 percent. The bubbles\ncan be formed with an internal gas\npressure of over 2,000 psi (13.8 x 106\nN/m2); any compatible gas can be used.\nThe high internal pressure further increases the strength-to-weight ratio.\nThe process can tailor materials for\ndifferent end uses by varying the combinations of gases, gas pressures, and\nbase materials. For example, an\naluminum base material with carbon\ndioxide gas bubbles could be molded for\nfabrication into flame-resistant fuel\ntanks. The density can be controlled so\nthat castings can be made for such products as aluminum engine blocks, instrument frames, and packaging\nspacers .

Flaws are\ndescribed by three important quantities:\ntotal number of flaws, the distribution of\nflaw sizes, and the rate of flaw growth.\nWhen the flaw reaches a critical size ,\nfailure occurs .\nThe flaw concept has had a long and\nsuccessful history in the formulation of\nfailure models. For example, it has been\ninvoked to explain why the strength of\nmetal is so much less than that calculated for a perfect specimen. The\nmeasured tensile strength of a metal is\n100 to 1,000 times less than theory predicts. It is therefore assumed that there\nare always flaws in specimens that\nweaken them . The flaw concept, in addition to providing a ready explanation for\nreduced lifetime, predicts two important\ncharacteristics: statistical variability of\nlifetime data and the dependence of lifetime on the volume of a sample.\n\nstants or in a simplified form . As an example of the simplified form, the effect of\ntemperature on a particular type of cell\n(assuming all other conditions to be held\nconstant) is expressed by\n\n8.8\n8.8\n8.4\n8.2\n\n.,\n\nc\n\n8.0\n\n~\n\n7.8\n\no\n\nn\n\n7.6\n7.4\n\n= Ae- BIT\n\n=\n\n7.2\n7.0\n\n3.1\n\n3.2\n\n3.3\n\n3.4\n\n3.5\n\n1,ooorr, K\xc2\xb71\n\nMeasured (Dots) and Predicted (Line)\nlogarithms of cell life for a particular test\nseries are plotted as a function of the\nreciprocal of the absolute temperature.\n\nThe model provides insight into the\nnature of flaw growth in electrochemical\ncells. It shows that the calculated value\nof activation energy is appropriate for a\ndiffusive or transport process of growth\nbut is too low for a chemical reaction . It\nalso shows that the change of flaw size is\nalmost exclusively a function of the\nnumber of charge/discharge cycles and\nnot of cycle time.\nThe equation can be written in its full\ncomplexity with all variables and con-\n\nwhere n\nthe most probable lifetime in\ncycles, A and B are constants, and T\nabsolute temperature. According to this\nequation , a plot of the logarithm of cycle\nlife versus the reciprocal of absolute\ntemperature should fall on a straight line\n(see figure).\nThis and other forms of the equation\nwere tested against cycle-life measurements of nickel/cadmium cells. The\nequations were put in straight-line form\n(as in the example of the figure) to facil itate comparisons with experimental\ndata.

TFE-insulated wire and cable and\nTFE tubing, tape, and forms can benefit\nby the substitution.\nIn the conventional manufacturing\nprocess, an aliphatic petroleum hydrocarbon (naphtha) is routinely used to wet\nthe TFE resin powder when it is formed\n\n212\n\ninto billets for ram extrusion. After extrusion , the polymer is heated to a\ntemperature of 200 0 to 575 0 F (93 0 to\n302 0 C) to evaporate the wetting agent.\nHowever, sometimes evaporation is incomplete: Entrapped fluids and gases\nthen form pinholes in the insulation to\nescape or, worse, remain as flammable\ncontam ination . The finished product\nmay then ignite at a low temperature\nand may support flames by releaSing the\nentrapped gas or volatile liquid.\n\nReplacement of the naphtha with perchloroethylen-e yields a polymer that extrudes well and generates fewer pinholes. More important, since perchloroethylene is not flammable, the product is\nless susceptible to fire during manufacturing and in service.\nTh is work was done by Alvin T.\nSheppard of Martin Marietta Corp. for\nMarshall Space Flight Center.

One of the most common\nseparators in use today is regenerated\ncellulose film, which is well suited for\nuse in nickel/zinc\xc2\xb7type cells. These films,\nhowever, rapidly deteriorate in the ox\xc2\xb7\nidative environment of silver/zinc-type\ncells.\nResearch was conducted to provide\nlow-cost, easily-fabricable, highly-ionconductive battery separators. This\nwork resulted in the development of\ntechniques for the in situ cross-linking of\npolyvinyl alcohol films.\nFilms or impregnated matrices can\nbe readily made from an aqueous\npolyvinyl alcohol solution. Controlledthickness films are made by casting\nprecise quantities of the aqueous\npolymer solution on a smooth surface,\nallowing the water to evaporate, and\nthen removing the film . Composite\nseparators can be formed in a similar\nfashion by impregnating a cloth matrix\nwith a polyvinyl alcohol solution and drying the composite.\nAt that point, the un-cross-linked or\nlinear-polymer material is still soluble in\nwater, and in this form the films or composites can be easily fabricated into\nvarious articles by cementing with a\nconcentrated polyvinyl alcohol solution\nand drying. To convert the water-soluble\npolymer to a water-insoluble material reo\nquires cross-linking of the polyvinyl\nalcohol. This enables this material to be\nused in aqueous systems without dissolving. The advantage of in situ crosslinking is that it facilitates fabrication\nwith the linear polymer. Cross-linking of\nthe fabricated article is done as the final\nstep.\nThree methods of cross-linking were\ninvestigated: The first method involves\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1983\n\ntreating a polyvinyl alcohol film containing a water-soluble dialdehyde cross\xc2\xb7\nlinker with an aqueous acid solution that\ncatalyzes acetalization cross-linking.\nThe main advantage of this cross-linking\nmethod is that the degree of crosslinking can be regulated by the amount\nof dialdehyde incorporated into the film.\nCross-linking increases with dialdehyde\ncontent. More cross\xc2\xb7linking results in\ngreater hardness of the film and higher\nresistivity; thus, a compromise must be\nreached in the amount of dialdehyde\nused so that a tough insoluble film of\ngood ionic conductivity results.\nThe second cross-linking method involves treating the fabricated polyvinyl\nalcohol with a periodic acid (acidified\naqueous potassium periodate). Polyvinyl\nalcohol is composed of 1,3 diol units\npendant to the carbon chain backbone;\nhowever, the commercial material contains minor amounts of 1,2 diol units.\nThe extent of cross-linking is determined\nby the proportion of 1,2 diol units in the\noriginal polyvinyl alcohol. This crosslinking technique is designed to provide\ngreater oxidation resistance to the\ncross-linked films because oxidationprone 1,2 diol units are essentially used\nup. Although the periodic-acid-treated\nfilms have excellent mechanical properties, their resistivities are higher than\nfilms treated by the other two methods.\nArea resistivity in 45-percent aqueous\nKOH for a film thickness of 180 f.lm is\nabout 1.0 ohm-cm 2.\nThe third cross-linking method utilizes\nionizing radiation . The fabricated films\nwere swelled in moist air and exposed to\nionizing radiation , such as 2-MeV electrons from a linear accelerator or Dynamitron (or equivalent) accelerator at a\nbeam flux of 10-6 Alcm 2 for about 5\nminutes. The radical formed from the irradiated water, namely hydrogen atoms,\nabstracts hydrogen atoms on the alpha\n\ncarbon of the polymer, which form linear\npolymer radicals. The radical sites recombine to form a cross-linked polymer\nstructure. Radiative cross-linking may\nalso be used to cross-link other linear\npolymers, such as polyacrylic acid, polyacrylamide, and polyvinyl pyrolidone.\nRadiolytic cross-linking produces the\nleast amount of cross-linking of the three\nmethods; but this method is the most\nversatile. The radiolytic cross-linking can\nbe used to cross-link polymer blends to\nform copolymers. One such cross-linked\ncopolymer, comprising a Ho-l ratio of\npolyvinyl alcohol and polyacrylic acid,\nshows promise as an ion-exchange\nmembrane. Thin membranes of this type\nhave been shown to be effective in removing metal cations, such as silver,\ncopper, and cobalt, from dilute solution.\nAn important feature of the in situ\ncross-linking method is that insoluble\nthin hydrophilic membranes can be\nmade from aqueous systems, and the\nuse of undesirable organic solvents is\nnot required .\nThis work was done by Warren H.\nPhilipp, U-Chen Shu, and Charles E.

An even catalytic coating is\nnecessary for even gaSification , or else\nsma ll, electrically-conduct ive fiber\nfragments will be released and pose an\nelectrical short-circuit hazard.\nCalcium acetate has been used as a\ncoating, but it tends to clump together\non the fibers. In the new coating the\ncalcium ions are polymerically bound in\nplace instead of simply precipitated from\nsolution.\n\nThe carbon fiber material is prepared\nby soaking in a solution of 20 percent\npolyacrylic acid in water.

The dried material is\nreacted with a boil ing aqueous solution\nof calcium acetate (or any other suitable\naqueous solution with a combination of\ndivalent metal ions). The treated material\nis removed from the boiling solution , blotted , dried at 120 0 C, washed with distilled water, and dried again.\nThe metal ions cross-link the chains of\nthe acrylate polymer, forming an insoluble metal catalytic coating on the fiber.\nThe last wash in distilled water removes\nany calcium that is not strongly bonded.\nThe average weight gain of the fibers due\n\nto the formation of the calcium polyacrylate coating is about 6 percent.\nThis work was done by Warren L.\nDowler, Kumar N.

The technique may therefore\noffer advantages for terrestrial use as\nwell as in space - for example, with the\naid of acoustic levitation to prevent\nmolten glasses from contacting their\nsu rroundings.\n\nHardware for containerless processing was also evaluated.

An interim goal is to draw\nthe boundaries of microfissuring regions\non plots of plastic strain versus\ntemperature.\n. In these experiments, the temperature range for low-strain incipient cracking was determined from hot ductility\ntests . The incipient-crack data for a\nspecific process must be considered\ncarefully since each process leads to\ndifferent mechanical properties in the\nheat-affected zone.\nThis work was done by Raymond G.\nThompson of the University of Alabama\nand A.

In addition\nto improved performance, the new\nmembranes differ from older types in\nthat they do not have to be stored in\nwater. The new membranes can be used\nto purify or desalinate seawater, brackish water, or industrial or domestic\nwastewater.\nA reverse-osmosis desalination membrane works better when it has an asymmetric structure than when it has a symmetric structure. A thin layer of lower\npermeability material is joined with a\nthicker layer of high-permeability\nmaterial. The two layers may be chemically identical or chemically distinct.\nThey may differ in density, compactness, or other respects.\nOlder membrane types were made of\nwater-insoluble polymers - most commonly, cellulose acetate. The new membranes are preferably made from\npoly(vinyl alcohol), which is more resistant to acids, bases, alcohols, and\nphenols that may be found in corrosive\nor contaminated streams.\nThe new membrane-preparation\nmethod uses water as the solvent. The\nasymmetric structure is achieved\nwithout employing a solvenUnonsolvent\nliquid precipitation system like that used\nin a previous asymmetric membraneproduction method.\nThe new fabrication method has three\nessential steps to which modifications\ncan be made. In the first step, a thin\nlayer of a water-soluble polymer is cast\nfrom a water-based solution. Layers\nfrom about 5 to 50 J.I1Tl thick perform\nbest: Thinner membranes are difficult to\nhandle, and thicker ones unduly restrict\nwaterflow. On a laboratory scale, the\ncasting can be done with a manual doctor blade.

However, it is believed to impart the desired\nasymmetric structure to the film . (Longer dehydration periods give denser,\nmore restrictive membranes.) Times of\n20 to 500 seconds at temperatures from\n15 0 to 50 0 C and relative humidity between 25 and 75 percent give best results. The resulting water-soluble asymmetric membrane is removed from the\ncasting surface.\nIn the third step, the membrane is insolubilized by immersion for 10 to 400\nhours in a preferably saturated aqueous\nsolution of salt of a polyvalent transition\nmetal; for example, copper sulfate. The\nmetal ion should be selected for low toxicity if the membranes are to be used to\nproduce drinking water. The solution\nshould be concentrated so that the insolubilitization will take place before the\nmembrane has a chance to dissolve.\nThe metal ions are believed to cause\ncross-linking of the polymer and to form\ncomplexes with it.\n\nThe asymmetric physical structure of\nthe new membranes was verified by examining one of them with a scanning\nelectron microscope.

The\nsalt rejection occurs at the nonporous\nsurface without impeding waterflow as\nmuch as the more-uniformly-dense symmetric membranes do.

The byproduct furfural must be\nextracted before fermentation because\nit is poisonous to micro-organisms and\nthereby inhibits fermentation.\nThe proposed solvent extraction\nwould replace the costly and timeconsuming double steam distillation now\nused by industry. Suitable solvents include biphenyl and diphenyl oxides:\nThese are routinely used as heattransfer agents because of their high\nboiling points and high heat stability.\nThey are completely miscible with furfural in all proportions, but are immiscible with water.\n\nRecent experiments have shown that\nwhen both water and the solvents are\npresent, furfural dissolves preferentially\nin the solvents and is almost completely\nremoved from the water. In the proposed\nsystem , the acid hydrolysis would be performed in a vessel containing both the\nsolvents and the reacting ingredients.\nWith intimate contact between the solvents and the aqueous hydrolysis liquor,\nthe furfural would be removed from the\nliquor almost as fast as it is formed .\nBecause of their immiscibility, the\nsolvent and water separate into layers.\nThe solvent can therefore be removed by\nsimple decantation . The solution of solvent and furfural is then flashed to distill\nthe furfural out of the higher-boiling-point\nsolvent. The flashing can be done under\nvacuum to reduce the energy required .\n\nThe process has some other advantages: It prevents the acid decomposition of the furfural at the hydrolysisreaction temperature. Less material will\nhave to be handled because less acid\nand less neutralization will be required . A\nfurther energy saving could be achieved\nby obtaining heat for the vacuum distillation from a solar concentrator, using the\nsolvent in its traditional role as a heatexchange fluid to carry the process heat\nfor its own distillation.\nThis work was done by Marshall F.\nHumphrey of Caltech for NASA\'s Jet\nPropulsion Laboratory.

The disk-shaped collector\nwould rotate, its periphery acting as a\ncentrifugal pump to recirculate the oil.\nDuring transit from the spray head to the\ncollector, the droplets would cool by\nradiating to space , thus removing waste\nheat from the spacecraft.\nCalculations show that a droplet\nradiator with a 1.37-m-diameter head\nspraying a cylindrical droplet beam to a\ncollector 137 m away could radiate\nabout 100 kW. Droplets were assumed\nto be about 0.004 inch (0.1 mm) in\ndiameter, about twice the diameter of\nthe spray jets.

One particularly difficult sensor to miniaturize has been a\nflow-angle and velocity sensor for\nmeasuring the local flow ahead of a\nwing .\nA miniature sensor using an electrooptical technique fills this need (see\nfigure). The size was reduced by a\ndesign that eliminates sliprings and\nreduces (minimizes) wiring within the\nsensor. Because the sensor is used in\nspin research, the angular ranges required are extremely large compared\nwith those of conventional flight: \xc2\xb1 120 0\nin angle-of-attack and \xc2\xb1 40 0 in yaw\nangle compared with 0 0 to 12 0 and\n\xc2\xb1 15 0 , respectively. The maximum\nairspeed expected is 70 mIs, although\nlarger speeds can be measured.\nThe sensor operates as a free-trailing\nwind vane that self-alines in the airstream through two independent axes. It\nis quickly installed and removed from\nairplanes on flight-test programs of a\nfew days duration. The vane is attached\nto the wing surface through a hollow\nmounting boom that fits on a mounting\nplate attached to the wing with twosided, neoprene-foam tape. This method\nhas been shown to be strong enough for\nthe loads of low-speed flight. A freeturning propeller located in the nose of\nthe vane rotates synchronously with the\nairstream while self-alinement is maintained by the lightweight tail.\nAngle-of-attack is the angular position\nof the cross-shaft relative to the axis of\nthe fixed boom mounted on the wing surface. A target disk attached to the crossshaft has a reflective strip on the rim that\nreflects light from a light-emitting diode\n(LED) to a PIN diode. The amount of light\nreceived is a function of the angle-ofattack. The sensor is calibrated by\nmeasuring the analog voltage output\nwith precisely set angles.\nBoth yaw angle and airspeed are\nderived from the second LED/reflec-\n\n226\n\nMiniature Flow\xc2\xb7Angle and Airspeed Sensor is quickly mounted on light aircraft wing with\ntwo-sided tape.

The\ninside diameter of the column is typically\n0.025 in. (0.635 mm). The dilatometer is\nmodified by the insertion of an Ni/Cr/Fe\nresistance wire in the center of the column, with platinum leads to the terminals on the outside. The wire is only\n0.001 in. (0.025 mm) in diameter, so that\n\nit has only a small effect on the volume\nsensitivity (multiplies it by 1.0016).\nThe resistance between the terminals\nis measured with a Wheatstone bridge\nor other instrument. The instrument output drives a strip-chart recorder. As the\nmercury rises in the column, it effectively short-circuits part of the wire, causing\na decrease in the resistance between\nthe terminals. Calibration points are obtained by measuring the resistance or\nobserving the strip-chart indication at\nknown column heights or sample volumes. Thus, the strip chart can be read\ndirectly in terms of sample volume versus time.\nThis work was done by Su-Don Hong\nand Virgil H.

This elevated\naccess floor system has been designed\nfor installations where a multitude of\ndiverse utility systems must be routed\nunder and up through the floor and\nwhere a separation of potentiallyconflicting utility services is required\n(i .e., water and electrical power).\nThese subfloor utility services may include hot, cold , and distilled water; hydraulic, chemical , or nutrient fluids ;\nnatural gas, oxygen , nitrogen, and compressed air; drainage for sewage, acids,\nand condensate; heating, ventilating, and\nair-conditioning; electrical power, electrical or pneumatic control systems, computer data links, telephone, intercom, and\nfire detection and suppression. The actual lines may include cables and conduits, pipes and ducts, and channels and\nraceways having a variety of physical\ndimenSions, mounting conditions, and\nconnection requirements.\nWith this new system, the floor is\ncovered by a continuous sheet of heatresealable vinyl. The floor system can be\ncut open when changes are made in\nutility lines and ducts. After the modifications have been completed, the floor\ncovering is resealed to protect the\nsubfloor utilities once again from spills\nand leaks.\nThe sheet-vinyl covering is laid on tiles\n(see Figure 1). Each tile contains a rectangular (or otherwise-shaped) recess\nthat accommodates a similarly shaped\nframe cemented to the underside of the\nfloor covering. The covering is thus\nprevented from sliding horizontally. The\ncovering is bonded to the upper frames\nbut not to the lower tiles. In fact , a thin\ncoating of light oil on the tile surface\nprevents adhesion. This provision ensures that the covering can be readily\nlifted away from the tiles.\nThe tiles are supported by an off-theshelf square grid of stringers and\npedestals, of the type commonly used\nfor computer access floors (see Figure\n2). The utility lines run in the space below\nthe pedestals, with " wet" lines in\ndedicated troughs or channels to contain any subfloor leaks or spills.

The height of the pedestals is adjustable.\n\ngrid is painted on the top surface of the\nsheet-vinyl covering, corresponding to\nthe network of stringers below (see\nFigure 3).\n\nWhen the floor must be penetrated to\ngive access to the subcavity, the vinyl\ncovering is cut around one or more tiles\nas indicated by the painted grid.

Permanent openings in\nthe floor system are cut directly through\nthe center of the locking frames and\nfloor tiles in the removed sections.\nSealable collars are inserted through\nthese openings in the floor system and\ncemented in place to prevent drainage\ninto the subcavity.\nAfter the subfloor rearrangements or\nrepairs are finished, the tiles and sheet\nvinyl are replaced, with the locking\nframes registering exactly into their\noriginal positions. The cut edges of the\npolyvinyl chloride covering are then\nresealed using commercially-available\nplastic heat-welding techniques. As the\ncolor of the painted grid is selected to\nmatch the heat-welded vinyl, the resulting surface is nearly indistinguishable\nfrom the original surface.\nThis work was done by Marc M.\nCohen of Ames Research Center.

Flow resistivity\nis the ratio of the pressure gradient\nacross a test specimen to the volume of\nair flowing through the specimen per\nunit time. Because flow resistivity is an\nimportant parameter appearing in\nacoustical models of the Earth\'s ground\nsurface, it is desirable to accompany\nmeasurements of acoustic ground impedance with measurements of flow\nresistivity .\nConventional instruments for measuring the flow resistivity are intrusive. They\nrequire that a test specimen be removed\nfrom the bulk material for testing . In the\ncase of the Earth\'s surface, removal of a\nspecimen from the ground causes immediate and irreversible changes, such\nNASA Tech Briefs, Wi nter 1983\n\nas the loss of moisture and other volatiles, changes in texture and organic\ncontent, and partial or total destruction\nof the root system of surface vegetation.\nThe in situ instrument is nonintrusive\nand permits measurement of the ground\nsurface in its unaltered condition.\nThe basic components of the instrument are shown in Figure 1. Initially, the\ncompressed-air reservoir is pressurized\nwith air through the quick-connect input\nand shutoff valve. During the flow\nresistivity measurement, the air flows\nthrough a pressure regulator, a needle\nvalve, flowmeters, flexible hose, and into\nthe specimen holder. The flowmeters,\nwhich may be of the rotameter type ,\nmeasure the volume velocity of the\nairflow. Pressure gage 3, which may be\na dial gage with a Bourdon tube,\n\nmeasures the pressure at the inlet of the\nspecimen holder and thus at the upper\nsurface of the specimen. The rotameters and dial gage do not require electricity for operation and are especially\nconvenient for use in the field.\nThe specimen holder, shown in detail\nin Figure 2, is the major component of\nthe in situ instrument. It consists of two\nconcentric cylinders, an inner cylinder\nand an outer cylinder, both made of a\nsturdy material such as stainless steel.\nThe specimen of ground under test is\ncontained within the inner cylinder. The\npurpose of this arrangement is to make\nthe air pressure at the upper surface A-A\nof the specimen equal to the pressure\nmeasured on the pressure gage and the\npressure at the lower surface 8-8 ap(continued on next page)\n229\n\nproximately equal to the ambient\npressure.\nThe sharp-edged inner cylinder is\ndriven into the ground first with the aid of\na special cap (not shown) to a typical\ndepth of 6 in. (15 cm). A small portion of\nthe inner cylinder remains above\nground. Then the concentric outer\ncylinder is driven into the ground, also\nwith the aid of a special cap. The outer\ncylinder penetrates into the ground\nseveral inches beyond the inner\ncylinder. A knife edge at the bottom of\nthe outer cylinder forms an annular\ntrench about the inner cylinder.\nThe interior surface of the outer\ncylinder consists of a rigid, firmlyfastened cylindrical screen that slides\nalong the inner cylinder as the outer\ncylinder is driven into the ground. The\nscreen prevents the ground material\nbelow the inner cylinder from falling into\nthe trench . A series of vent holes, drilled\ninto the wall of the outer cylinder and\nlocated above ground, permits the\npassage of air from the trench to the ambient atmosphere and ensures that the\npressure throughout the trench remains\nat ambient pressure.\nAfter the two cylinders are properly\npositioned, the air supply is connected\nto the inner cylinder through the quickconnector fitting. A uniform flow is\nestablished in the ground specimen between planes A-A and 8-8. The pressure\nat 8-8, because of the proximity of this\nplane to the trench, is approximately\nequal to the ambient pressure. After the\nflow passes plane 8-8, it turns radially\ntoward the trench and passes upward\nthrough the trench and through the ventholes. The flow through the specimen\nholder is indicated by arrows.\nThe flow resistivity R is determined\nfrom the equation\nR = (P - RhU)SC/UH\nwhere P is the pressure as read on the\npressure gage, Rh is the flow resistance\nof .the flexible hose, S is the crosssectional area of the ground specimen,\nU is the volume velocity of the airflow as\nmeasured on the flowmeters, H is the\nspecimen depth, which is equal to the\ndistance between planes A-A and 8-8,\nand C is a correction factor to account\nfor the pressure drop between plane 8-8\nand the trench. (C\n1 - O.324a/H\nwhere a is the internal radius of the inner\ncylinder.)\nThis work was done by Allan J.\nZuckerwar of Langley Research Cen\xc2\xb7\nter.

A radially increasing temperature (see figure) should\nallow a higher mean gas temperature,\ngreater power output, higher rotational\nspeed, and a longer life for the blades.\nThe principle is suitable for an axial-flow\ngas turbine that is directly in line with a\ncylindrical combustor. Included in this\ncategory are many rocket, aircraft, stationary, and shipboard turbines.\nThe requisite temperature distribution\ncan be provided by a fuel injector composed of multiple elements arranged in\nconcentric rings. The fuellair ratio and\nflame temperature would be high at the\nouter elements and would decrease\ngradually toward the center. Thus, a\nblade is subjected to the least temperature at the blade root (where the mechanical stress is greatest) and the\ngreatest temperature at the blade tip\n(where the mechanical stress is least).\nSince the ability to withstand high\nstress is degraded by high temperature\nand the ability to withstand high temperature is degraded by high stress, the graded temperature profile enables the inner\nportions of the turbine blades to remain\nfurther within the envelope of maximum\nallowable operating stress and tempera-\n\nPREBURNER\nSECTION\n\n.\n\nBLADE\n\n-\n\nINJECTOR\n\nFUEUAIR\nPROFILE\n\nRADIUS\n\nBLADE TIP\n\nInstead of Burning Fuel Uniformly, the new fuel injector burns more fuel at the perimeter\nof a turbine and less toward the center.

The aerodynamic\nsurfaces are coated with a thin film of\nsuch volatile chemical sol ids as naphthalene, diphenyl , acenaphthene, or\nfluorene _ The film sublimes rapidly because of high local shear stress and\nheat transfer in the boundary layer. The\ncoating appears white in the regions\nwhere the chemical has remained on\nthe surface, indicating laminar flow; the\nregions where the chemical has disappeared indicate turbulent flow.\nThe chemical patterns can be used to\nidentify the locations of leading-edge\nstagnation and of flow separation _Stagnation is observed where sublimation is\nfirst complete on the leading edge. With\nsparsely-distributed roughness ele. ments near the leading edge, stagnation\n\n232\n\ncan be located between the apexes of the\ntransition wedges that "point" toward\neach other. Separation can be observed\nwhere chemicals remain on the surface\ndue to greatly-reduced heat transfer in\nthose regions. Good control of coating\nthickness is essential to the accurate observation of these phenomena.\nThe chemicals used differ in their rate\nof sublimation, naphthalene being the\nfastest to subl ime and fluorene being the\nslowest. Fluorene has an advantage of\nbeing fluorescent under UV light. The\nchemicals are selected depending on\nambient temperature at the test altitude,\nwith colder temperatures requiring faster\nsublimating chemicals. Acenaphthene,\nfor example, is useful for subsonic and\ntranson ic flight testing at ambient\ntemperatures between 0\xc2\xb0 and 40\xc2\xb0 C.\nTypical sublimation time at these temperatures, using average coating thickness,\nis 120 and 5 minutes, respectively.\n\nThe chemical cost to treat a moderatesize airplane with 100 ft2 (9.3 m 2) of\nwing area is about $10 (1982 dollars).\nSuitable solvents for these chemicals include 1,1,1-trichloroethane (TCE), acetone, or Freon TF.\nBecause the chemical coating is\nwhite, the surface to be sprayed should\nbe dark. A light-colored surface shows\nthe transitions but is difficult to photograph. The surface should not be allowed to heat up in Sunlight because the\nheat can cause sublimation before the\ntakeoff. Early morning or late afternoon\ntest periods with low Sun angles are\nbest.\nThe chemical is applied with a spray\ngun that has a flat fan nozzle with minimum orifice and needle sizes, the orifice\ndiameter being between 0.030 and 0.040\nin. (0_ and 1.02 mm). The gun is oper76\nated at about 25 psi (173 kN/m2) air\npressure or 5 psi (34 kN/m2) fluid presNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1983\n\nsure if a pressure feed sprayer is used\nFor proper dry spraying, the spray nozzle\nshould be held between 15 to 20 in. (38\nto 50 cm) from the surface, indicated by\na powdery appearance of the chemical\ncoating.\nBefore the coated aircraft takes off, it\nshould be brushed with a large, softbristle brush or wiped with cheesecloth\nto loosen any particles that may have\nadhered to the coating. This prevents\nturbulent wedges, which if too numerous, can obliterate the free transition\nlocation. Extra-thick coatings are useful\nin extending the sublimation time of the\nmore volatile chemicals in experiments\nat high altitudes.\nThe spraying solution is prepared by\ndissolving one part of the chemical\nsolute by volume in eight parts of sol-\n\nvent. A conven ient way to measure\nthese amounts is to mix 100 ml of\nchemical in 1 qt (0.95 I) of solvent. The\nsolution is sprayed when the solute is\ncompletely dissolved. A standard application rate is 1 qt per 20 to 30 ft 2 (0.95 I\nper 2 to 3 m2) of surface area. With acenaphthene, such a coating thickness\nhas a sufficiently long reaction time to\npermit ample time to run the flight test\nwithout creating confUSing chemical\npatterns. The resulting data are readily\nobserved and recorded on the ground.\nDuring the test flight, the indicated\ntest speed and altitude should be held as\nlong as practical. If the burned fuel\nlightens the airplane by more than about\n10 percent during the test, a speed\nschedule should be worked out to keep\nthe airplane lift coefficient constant.\n\nA very small, thick piece of masking\ntape located within 6 in. (15 cm) of the\nwing leading edge can serve as a\nboundary-layer trip, a " calibrated" indication of the rate of chemicaltransition pattern development. This trip\nshould be visible to the pilot. When the\nchemical pattern appears mature, the\npilot can bring the aircraft down as near\nto the indicated test speed as is safe.\nTypically, pattern development times\nare greater than 10 minutes, allowing\nample time for normal approaches and\nlandings.\nThis work was done by Bruce J.\nHolmes, Cynthia C.

By combining functions, the\nconcept reduces the signal bandwidth,\nthe number of connecting wires, weight,\nand power consumption while permitting\nhigh tactile resolution.\nA key feature of the concept is that\ncomputation at the site of transduction\npermits useful information to be extracted from the raw tactile image and\nselectively communicated to a central\ncontroller.

The electrodes and computation\nelements are contained in a silicon integrated-clrcuit wafer.\n\nThe exposed surface of the LSI wafer\ncontains an array of pairs of electrodes\ncovered by a sheet of electrically conductive rubber (see figure). When the\nrubber sheet is deformed by touch, its\nresistivity varies locally. Thus, current\n\npassing through the sheet between a\npair of electrodes indicates the local\ncontact pressure.\nAssociated with each electrode pair is\na computation element consisting of an\n(continued on next page)\n233\n\nanalog comparator , a data register, and\nan accumulator. Each element reads the\nlocal conductivity data from its electrode\npair and performs simple calculations.

A distributed shift register allows all\noutputs from the wafer to be communicated over a conveniently compact\nchannel - a single wire.\nSince a silicon LSI wafer is used intact\ninstead of being sliced into many individual chips, defective chips cannot be\ndiscarded.

The structure is\nrigid and lightweight. It allows access to\nall subsystems and equipment from the\noutside, and its components can be carried by the Space Shuttle. A comparable\nterrestrial structure could be assembled\nfrom components carried in a truck or\nship.\nThe " sphere" shown in the figure is\ncomposed of 20 panels, all equilateral\ntriangles 12 feet (3.66 m) on a side.\nWhen assembled, the panels form an\napproximately spherical structure 23\nfeet (7 m) in diameter.\nEach panel is secured at its apexes to\na five-sided adapter with a single bolt.\nThe adapter allows limited moments and\nthus differs from a true geodesic\nmember, which acts only in tension and\ncompression.\nElectrical cables are routed along the\nedges of the panels. For example, power\ncables from the panels containing solarcell arrays can be run along the panel\nedges to the power panel containing batteries and regulators. Similarly, cables\ncan be run from the command and data\npanels to the experiment and propulsion\npanels.\nAny panel can be removed from the\nsphere and replaced. The structure will\nnot collapse because it has redundant\nload paths.\nThe panel and structure size can be\nincreased by combining panels to make\na larger triangular panel. Four 12-foot\npanels can be combined as a triangle 24\nteet (7.3 m) on a side. Nine panels can\nbe combined as a triangle 36 feet (11 m)\non a side.\nThe structures can be combined with\npressurized vessels tor human occupants. A wide variety of configurations,\nincorporating multiple spheres and pressurized vessels, is possible. In addition a\nlarge sphere can totally enclose one or\nmore pressure vessels. A strengthened\nversion may be useful on Earth for\nrapidly-erectable temporary shelters,\nindustrial structures , or playground\nequipment.\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, W inter1983\n\n/\n\n/\n\n/\n\n/\n/\n/\n\n/\n\nADAPTER DETAIL\n\nA Regular Icosahedron is constructed from triangular panels.

Then when it is bolted to\nthe flat heat-sink plate, the two surfaces\nflex slightly, coming into intimate contact over the entire surface, thereby\nenhancing heat transfer.\nThe convex curvature of the baseplate could be introduced, for example,\nby machine screws threaded through a\nbeam (see figure). In other applications\nthe curvature might be introduced by\nstamping or machining the plate itself.\nFurthermore, it does not matter which of\nthe two plates is convex: indeed, they\ncould both be made slightly convex.\nThis technique should be applicable\nin a variety of situations, including the\nmounting of heat-producing electronic\ndevices in confined spaces where convective cooling cannot be used.

It\nconsists of a temperature probe embedded inside a thermally massive material\n(see figure). The mass, in turn , is enclosed in a sealed housing to suppress\nthe effects of cyclical and short-term\nfluctuations in temperature. The probe\nmeasurements can be used to estimate\npowerplant heating and cooling loads, to\nmap temperature profiles, and to cal ibrate more -sens it ive temperature\nprobes.\n\n236\n\nAs shown in the figure , the probe\ntemperature sensor is embedded in a\nhole in the solid heat-conducting mass; a\nheat-conducting material fills the remainder of the hole. The high-thermalconductivity mass - aluminum, for example - is cylindrical or spherical and is\nmounted on a thermally insulating\nmaterial that holds it away from the thin\nhousing walls. The housing too is constructed of a thermally conduct ive\nmaterial. Prototypes of the probe have a\nbox-shaped housing.\nThe total surface of the housing is\nmade large enough to maximize the heat\n\nflow rate in and out of it. However, the\nhousing surface is not so large as to\ncreate a thermal mass of fill gas that is\nSignificant compared to the solid thermal\nmass.\nThe temperature of the housing is\nabout equal to the instantaneous\ntemperature of the fluid surrounding the\nhousing, while the temperature of the\nenclosed mass lags beh ind the temperature of the fluid . The separation of the\nhousing and mass creates a limiting thermal resistance that, together with the\nmass, determines the thermal time constant - that is, the period of time for\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter1983\n\ntemperature averaging - of the probe\nindependently of the velocity of the fluid\ncontacting the exterior of the housing.\nThe value of the probe time constant can\nbe tailored to different applications by increasing or decreasing the thermal\nmass; for example, by replacing a mass\nwith one of either smaller or greater thermal conductivity.\nThe housing can contain either a gas\nfilling or a vacuum. A vacuum would\nhave a longer time constant than a gas\nfilling and would transfer heat by radiation rather than convection .\nThis work was done by Lou F.

In laser\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter1983\n\nvelocimeter applications, however, the\nsampling process is random. Since the\nmeasured particles arrive according to\nPoisson\'s distribution, classical approaches become inapplicable.

The unit allows the\ncomputation of both autocorrelation and\ncross-correlation functions and performs a correlation computation approximately 200 times faster than does a 16-bit\nminicomputer while maintaining equal\naccuracy.

The major\nsource of interior noise in single-engine\naircraft is the engine, which produces\nstructural vibration in the 60- to 1,600-Hz\nrange. The purpose of the program was\nto develop ways of screening candidate\nmaterials considered for noise control\nand to establish test procedures for verifying the choice of a particular control\nmeasure.\nThe program focused on a laboratorybased test procedure to simulate engineinduced structurally transmitted noise,\nto test a range of noise isolators for relative performance and for basic data for\nanalytical model correlation , and to develop an analytical model for isolator design. The test procedure for simulating\nengine-induced noise involved direct excitation of a rigid engine with an electrodynamic shaker. Candidate noise-control\nmeasures were then evaluated from\n\ntransfer-function data obtained as\ninterior-sound pressure-level response\nfor a given force input. A series of isolators, including a rigid baseline set, was\ntested; and relative comparisons were\nmade between the measured transfer\nfunctions.\nAn analytical model was developed\nby empirical characterization of the aircraft aft of the firewall. The model uses\nfinite-element structural analysis and dynamic modeling procedures to determine noise performance of components\nforward of the firewall. Coupling procedures are used to combine contributions\nto noise from the various components.\nAnalytical modeling of the simulated\nengine, vibration isolators, and engine\nmount structure was combined with an\nem pi rical model of the fuselage to develop a more-realistic noise-transmission\nmodel of the test aircraft. A comparison\nof the predicted structure-borne noise\ntransmission with the laboratory measurements showed that the frequency\n\ndependence of the isolator material\nplays a major role in the noise transmission. Isolator stiffness is a dominant\nparameter, while the isolator damping\ncharacteristic is much less significant.\nResults from the tested aircraft show\nthat moderate changes to the engine\nmount structure do not significantly affect the noise transmission . The developed modeling procedures seem adequate for the evaluation of the relative\nperformance of candidate noise\nisolators.\nThis work was done by James F.\nUnruh and Dennis C.

The results and\ntrends observed during the study can be\nextrapolated to reduce time required\nand energy expended in cooling other\nsimilarly-constructed cryogenic wind\ntunnels.\nThe research included simulated\ncool downs using procedures normally\nemployed by each of several TCT\noperators, simulated cool downs at constant mach number, simulated cooldowns at various constant fan speeds,\nand simulated cooldowns at constant\n\n238\n\nmetal-to-gas temperature differences.\nThe effects of high and low LN2 flow\nrates on cooling time and LN2 consumption were also investigated. Normal\ncooldowns, used to show the wide variations in both time and LN2 consumption\nthat can occur, were made completely\nopen-loop (temperature, pressure, and\nfan speed), while all other simulated\ncooldowns used automatic closed-loop\npressure-feedback control.\nThe study showed that open-loop\ncooldown techniques are a dominant\nfactor in determining the total LN2 consumption when the cooldown of a cryogenic wind tunnel is manually controlled .\nIn general, relatively low fan speeds (900\nto 1,200 rpm) or mach numbers (0.20 to\n\n0.35) during the cool down are much\nmore time- and energy-efficient when\nthe tunnel is cooled from the ambient to\ncryogenic temperatures (300 to 100 K).\nResults showed that much less LN2 is\nused if the fan speed or mach number is\nlow during cooldown .\nModerate rates of LN2 injection (1 .2\nto 1.8 kgls), which allow efficient use of\nboth the sensible and latent heats of the\ninjected LN2, preclude excessive LN2\nconsumption during the cooldown . Because of reduced operator attention required as well as decreased LN2 consumption, it is recommended that the\ncool downs at constant fan speed of\n1,200 rpm and an LN2 injection rate of\nabout 1.5 kgls should be used routinely\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1983\n\nfor the Langley TeT. This will ensure a\nfairly low metal-to-gas temperature difference throughout the cooldown while\nsimultaneously allowing the cooldown to\nproceed at an acceptable rate. CooIdown at higher pressures at mach numbers above about 0.30 is not advocated,\nbecause LN2 consumption and cool-\n\ndown time drastically increase with\nlower metal-to-gas temperature difference_ Finally, because of the additional\nLN2 penalty to be paid for high tunnel\npressure buildup, it is better to use existing higher pressures (if possible) when\ncommencing cooldown .\nThis work was done by Jerry J.\nThibodeaux of Langley Research Cen-\n\nter.

As is often the case\nwhen partial differential equations fail or\nchange type for certain values of the\nsystem parameters, the properties of the\nmathematical solutions also change fundamentally. In the case of equations describing elastic structures, mathematical instabilities that occur at such critical\npoints correspond to the onset of such\nphysical phenomena as growing oscillations, buckling, or wrinkling.\nThe paper presents a generalized approach to structural elastodynamics as\npart of a continuing effort to develop\nmathematical stability criteria for structures and to simulate postinstability\nbehavior of elastics in general. The equations of motion of elastics are presented\nin a generalized form. Local accelerations are expressed in terms of\nexternally-applied force densities and\nspatial derivatives of the potential\n\nenergy of strains. There is postulated an\ninfinitesimal initial disturbance for which\nthe equations of motion can be linearized during an infinitesimal time.\nThe equations of motion are put in the\nform of matrices, the eigenvalues of\nwhich are the squares of characteristic\nroots of the equations of motion. The appearance of negative eigenvalues (and,\nconsequently, of imaginary roots) leads\nto a violation of the continuous\ndependence between initial and transient disturbances during an arbitrarily\nshort time and within an arbitrarily\nselected volume. Examples of phYSical\nphenomena with such mathematical\nbehavior include a string or film that is\nnot under tension or which one attempts\nto compress along its length or surface.\nThe failure of a hyperbolic form is illustrated by the example of an ideally\nflexible pipe (or hose) under tension, in\n\nBooks and Reports\nThese reports , studies , and handbooks are available from NASA as\nTechnical Support Packages (TSP\'s)\nwhen a Request Card number is\ncited ; otherwise they are available\nfrom the National Technical\nInformation SeNice .\n\nMathematical Instability\nCriteria for Elastic\nStructures\nThe vanishing of hyperbolic\nterms has physical\nsignificance.\nA theoretical paper discusses the\nphysical Significance of the vanishing of\nhyperbolic coefficients in equations of\n240\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter1983\n\nwhich flows an ideal inviscid fluid.

Intended for use in designing spacecraft where the same booster\nis to be flown with any of a number of\ninterchangeable payloads, the technique is also applicable to large stationary structures, land vehicles, airplanes,\nships, or wherever vibration analysis\nmust be done repeatedly after each of\nmany design changes.\nThe technique is a scheme for the accurate and efficient numerical integration of the coupled equations of motion\nof a vehicle and its payload(s). It involves\nno initial approximations or assumptions\nand is more exact than normal-mode\nmethods that include such assumptions.\nThe full coupled equations of motion\nare derived, then transformed to\neliminate superfluous terms relating to\nthe vehicle/payload interface degreesof-freedom. The interface-loadtransformation method can just as well\nbe applied to several payloads as to one\npayload, since the approach and the\nform of the equations remain the same.\nThe result is a set of reduced equations\nin matrix form that permits more efficient\nuse of computer time than would the full\ncoupled-system matrices.\nA shortcut integration technique\ncalled the "base-drive" technique gives\na fast solution when the feedback from\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1983\n\nthe payloads to the vehicle is neglected.\nThe equations of motion of the vehicle\nare first solved, neglecting completely\nthe payload terms. The vehicle solution\nprovides the forcing function for the payload equations.\nThe payload solution includes terms\nthat represent the feedback from the\npayload to the vehicle. If the feedback\nterms are small, they are neglected in\nthe vehicle equations, and the solutions\nare accepted. When the feedback terms\nexceed preset values, it is necessary to\nresort to the full coupled equations. An\nappropriate computer program would\nminimize computing time by switching to\nthe base-drive technique whenever it is\npermissible according to the smallness\ncriterion.

(fhis\nmodel was previously discussed in\n"Multivalued-Velocity-Field Model of\nTurbulence," (NPO-15748) on page 432\nof NASA Tech Briefs, Vol. 7, No.4.) The\nmultivalued-velocity model may have\npractical implications in the design of\naircraft, turbines, nozzles, pumps, and\nother systems that involve turbulent\nflow.\nAs described in the earlier article, the\nmultivalued-velocity field is mathematically represented as a vector that\ndepends not only upon space and time\n\nbut also upon a multivaluedness parameter, ~ . In cases in which the mUltivalued-velocity field tends to exhibit\ninstabilities like those of classical singlevalued-velocity fields, it may be necessary to introduce a second degree of\nmultivaluedness . In that case, ~\nbecomes ~(1) and the further complication of the field at ~(1) is expressed as a\nfunction of ~(2). The multivalued-velocity\nfield is conveniently decomposed into a\ncenter-of-inertia component vc. which is\nanalogous to the classical single-valued\nvelocity. plus the multivalued pulsational\ncomponent vr(~) .\nThe equations of fluid motion are\ntreated by a variational method, using\nthe principle of virtual work. An arbitrary\ntensor having the dimensionality of\nstress is introduced as a Lagrange\nmultiplier. The solution of the variational\nequations leads to a stress-tensorlike\nfunction having the same degree of\nmultivaluedness as that of the fluid\nvelocity. A classical or single-valued\nstress-tensor component Tcc is obtained by integrating over the multivaluedness parameter(s). The stress\ntensor is found to play the role of a reaction to the mathematical constraint of\nsingle valued ness of velocity; that is, the\nsingle valuedness of velocity becomes\nequivalent to the possiblity of introducing a stress tensor. The resulting equations show how the behavior of the\nclassical velocity component depends\non the behavior of tt"\\e multivalued pulsational component and vice versa.\nThe new formalism has been applied\nto a number of fluid problems, including\nnotably the Navier-Stokes equations for\na viscous fluid. Though the multivaluedvelocity approach also leads to mathematical instabilities in many cases, the\nintroduction of ever higher degrees of\nmultivaluedness or ad hoc higher-order\nviscosity parameters can force the solutions to become mathematically stable.\nIn both viscous and inviscid cases, the\nequations can be made to predict a stable regime of oscillations that are both\nfinite and independent of the initial conditions as in the case of real turbulence.\nThis work was done by Michail A.

The applications include (a) minimum-mass\ndesign with cross-sectional areas as\nvariables and stress constraints or (b)\nthe first natural frequency as the objective function with overall shape design\nvariables and stress and buckling constraints.\nEAUPROSSS can be used as follows:\na. as a research tool for the development of optimization techniques that\nwill interface with an efficient\nanalysis program ;\nb. as a research tool for testing new\nanalysis techniques that will interface\n242\n\nwith an efficient optimization program; and\nc . as an application tool that can be\nadapted to a wide range of problems .\nThe analysis and optimization programs are executed repeatedly in a\nlooping manner until the process is\nstopped by a user-defined termination\ncriterion. This part of the system is referred to as the repeatable part of\nEAUPROSSS. Some of the analysis,\nhowever, such as model definition, need\nonly be done one time and can be saved\nfor future use. These parts are performed outside of the loop and are referred to as the nonrepeatable part of\nEAUPROSSS. Five options are available\nfor organizing optimization procedures\nby combining nonlinear or piecewise linears programing methods with analytic\nor finite-difference gradients.\nThe EAUPROSSS system is written in\nFORTRAN IV for batch execution and\nhas been implemented on a CDC\n6000-series computer with a centralmemory requirement of approximately\nWOK (octal) of 60-bit words . The\nEAUPROSSS user must have access to\nthe CDC version of the commerciallyavailable EAL structural-analysis program. EAUPROSSS was developed in\n1981.\nThis program was written by James L.\nRogers, Jr., of Langley Research Center_ For further information, Circle A on the COSMIC Request Card.\nLAR-13046\n\nMinimizing Weight of\nStructural Designs\nApproximation concepts are\ncombined with dual-method\nalgorithms.\nThe Approximation Concepts Code\nfor Efficient Structural Synthesis (ACCESS3) combines methods to offer the\nstructural system designer a powerful ,\nefficient tool for the synthesis of\nminimum-weight designs. The approximation concepts convert the general\nstructural synthesis problem into a sequence of explicit problems of separable\nalgebraic form; the dual method exploits\nthis separable form to construct a sequence of explicit dual functions. The\ndual functions are maximized subject to\nnon negativity constraints on the dual\nvariables. This approach is very efficient\nbecause the dimensionality of the dual\n\nspace, where most of the optimization is\nexpended, is relatively low for most\nstructural optimization problems of\npractical interest.\nA general class of structural optimization problems can be concisely stated\nas a nonlinear programing (NLP) problem involving the minimization of an\nobjective function subject to a set of inequality constraints . For practical\nstructural-design applications, the\nassociated NLP problem is often very\ncomplicated due to the large number of\ndesign variables, the large set of inequality constraints, and the computational difficulties associated with the\nconstraint functions. The ACCESS3\napproach makes such an NLP problem\ntractable by replacing it with a sequence\nof relatively-small, explicit mathematical\nprograming problems that approximate\nthe original problem while retaining\nimportant problem features. This is\naccomplished through the coordinated\nuse of design variable linking, constraint\ndeletion techniques, and explicit approximations for retained constraints .\nStructures with prescribed configurations and given material properties can\nbe optimized so that their structural\nweight is minimized. This is achieved by\nmodifying the sizing of the finite\nelements, in particular their crosssectional areas or thicknesses . Types of\nfinite elements available in the ACCESS3\nprogram include a truss element, an\nisotropic constant-strain triangular\nmembrane element, a constant-strain\ntriangular element with arbitrary orthotropic material properties, an isotropic\nshear panel element, and a thermal\nshear panel element.\nA thermal load analysis capability is\nincluded for problems involving load\nvectors that are dependent on deSign\nvariables. In addition to the usual Taylor\nseries expansion with respect to the\nreciprocals of linked design variables,\nnatural frequency constraints may be\nrepresented as first- or second-order\nTaylor series expansions with respect to\nregular linked variables.\nFour distinct optimizer algorithm\noptions are available in the ACCESS3\nprogram. These are the interior pointpenalty function method, the secondorder primal projection method, the\nsecond-order Newton-type dual method,\nand the first-order gradient projectiontype dual method.\nInput data for ACCESS3 consists of a\nfinite-element model that exhibits the\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1983\n\ntopological form, the geometrical configuration, and the structural materials\nof the structural system to be optimized,\nalong with a set of structural loads and a\nselection of program options. The output\nincludes a description of the resizing of\nelements required to achieve minimum\nweight.\nThe ACCESS3 program is written in\nFORTRAN IV for batch execution and\nhas been implemented on an IBM\n370-series computer with a centralmemory requirement of approximately\n800K of 8-bit bytes. ACCESS3 was\ndeveloped in 1979.\nThis program was written by Lucien A.\nSchmit, Jr., and Claude Fleury of the\nUniversity of California, Los Angeles, for\nLangley Research Center.

Dynamic response analysis is of primary importance in the deSign of such a wide range\nof practical structures as spacecraft,\nbuildings, and rotating machineries.\nA vital preliminary for such an analysis involves the determination of the natural frequencies and the associated\nmodes. Both spinning and nonspinning\nstructures, with or without viscous and\nstructural damping, as well as the quadratic matrix eigenproblem associated\nwith a finite dynamic discretization, may\nbe analyzed with the EIGSOL program.\nFor most complex practical structures, such discrete modeling results in\na rather large number of simultaneous\nequations, which are usually of highly\nbanded configuration . The EIGSOL program exploits this inherent matrix sparsity to effect an economical solution of the\neigenproblem. The program uses an outof-core solution strategy so that even\nlarge and complex problems may be\nsolved.\nThe EIGSOL program is written in\nFORTRAN V for batch execution and\nhas been implemented on a UNIVAC\n1100\xc2\xb7series computer with a centralmemory requirement of approximately\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter1983\n\n22K of 36-bit words .

When\nTRASYS II is used in conjunction with a\ngeneralized thermal-analysis program,\nsuch as the Systems Improved Numerical Differencing Analyzer (SINDA) program, any thermal pr.oblem that can be\nexpressed in terms of a lumpedparameter RC thermal network can be\nsolved.\nTRASYS II provides for the calculation\nof internode radiation interchange data\nand for the calculation of incident and\nabsorbed heat-rate data originating from\nenvironmental radiant heat sources.\nData of both types are provided by\nTRASYS II in a format directly usable by\nsuch thermal-analyzer programs as\nSINDA.\nTRASYS II consists of two major components: the preprocessor and the processor library. One primary feature of\nTRASYS II is that it allows users to write\ntheir own executive, or driver, programs\nthat organize and direct the library routines toward solving each specific problem in the most expeditious manner.\nThe preprocessor first reads and converts the user\'s geometry input data into\nthe form used by the processor library\nroutines. Next, the preprocessor accepts the user\'s driving logic, written in\nthe TRASYS II-modified FORTRAN language, that directs the user-provided\nand processor library routines in the\nsolution of the problem.\nThe processor library consists of\nFORTRAN routines that perform functions commonly needed to solve\nthermal-radiation problems. In many\ncases, the user has a choice of solution\ntechniques to perform the same function. As previously mentioned, users\nmay supply their own routines. In parti-\n\ncular, the user may write output routines\nto provide for an interface between\nTRASYS II and any thermal-analyzer\nprogram using the RC network concept.\nInput to the TRASYS II program consists of EDIT/CONTROL data and\nMODEL data. The EDIT/CONTROL data\ndo not participate in the definition of the\nthermal\xc2\xb7radiation problem but serve as\nbasic program control and offer editing\ncapability. The MODEL data participate\nin the definition of the mathematical\nmodel of the thermal-radiation problem.\nThe MODEL data include surfacegeometry, documentation, nodal, block\ncoordinate-system, form-factor, and\noperations data (the user\'s driver logic),\nalso user-supplied subroutines.\nTRASYS II currently allows problems\nwith as many as 1,DOD nodes and timevariable problem geometry. The edit\ncapability allows for the easy modification of complex thermal-radiation problem models.\nOutput from TRASYS II consists of\ntwo basic types of data: internode radiation interchange data and incident- and\nabsorbed-heat rate data. A plot package\nserves in plotting input geometry, orbit\ndata (for on-station spacecraft problems), the two basic types of data just\ndescribed, and any other data generated by the user\'s driver logic. TRASYS II\nbuilds a plot data tape that is read by a\nplotting driver program, which currently\ndisplays the plots on a Tektronix 4014\ngraphics terminal.\nThe TRASYS II software is written in\nFORTRAN IV-Plus and has been implemented on a DEC VAX-11/780 computer under VMS 2.0. The DEC VAX implementation of the TRASYS II software\nwas completed in 1981.\nThis program was written by Joseph\nSkladany of Goddard Space Flight\nCenter.

The thermocouple is allowed to\nheat until it approaches its melting point,\nand then the thermocouple is cooled by\na gas jet. While the gas is off and the\nthermocouple is heating, the thermocouple output is sampled at a high rate\nand recorded. The gas temperature is\ncalculated by extrapolation from the\ninitial heating curve.\nPrevious programs of this type were\nbased on a simple first-order exponential curve fit. This approach is inadequate, mainly because it does not\naccount for radiation effects. This new\nprogram is based on a theoretical\nheating curve that includes the effect of\nradiation in the extrapolation. The equation that describes the pulsed-thermocouple wire temperature is derived from\nbasic heat-transfer relations . The\ntheoretical heating curve includes heat\ntransfer by radiation from the hot walls\nof the duct to the wire, from the gas to\nthe wire, and from radiant heat emitted\nby the wire .\nThis program uses a curve-fitting procedure called the gradient-expansion\nmethod to fit the theory to the thermocouple collected data. The program\nrequires as input the mach number, the\nwall temperature, and the total pressure\nin addition to the thermocouple data.\nTests indicate that this new program\nextrapolates reasonably-accurate gas\ntemperatures from pulsed-thermocouple data.\nThis progam is written in FORTRAN IV\nfor batch execution and has been implemented on an IBM 370-series computer\nwith a central-memory of approximately\n66K of 8-bit bytes.

The Parameterized Investigation of Launch Opportunities and Trajectories (PILOT) program was developed to\nperform mission simulation computations that yield data for use in delimiting\noptimum launch windows. PILOT per244\n\nforms parametric scans of a userspecified trajectory over launch date and\ninitial right ascension of the ascending\nnode. During each scan , various mission\nparameters are generated and output to\na data file.\nThe CoPILOT utility program is used to\nread and format the PILOT-generated\ndata file. The user specifies acceptable\nlimits on the various PILOT-generated\nparameters. The CoPILOT program\nchecks the data and generates an output\ntable with notations of any constraint\nviolations . When no constraints are\nviolated, an acceptable launch time exists. For each date, the acceptable\nlaunch times are printed. A printer plot\nmay also be generated to display visually\nthe launch window.\nThe PILOT and CoPILOT programs\nare written in FORTRAN IV for batch execution and have been implemented on\nan IBM 360-series computer with a\ncentral-memory requirement of approximately 338K of 8-bit bytes. PILOT and\nCoPILOT were developed in 1977.\nThis program was submitted by Judith\nA. Erickson of Computer Sciences Corp.\nfor Goddard Space Flight Center.

The program\nis applicable to arbitrary axialcompressor hub, tip, and blade geometries, including blades with part-span\ndampers. The program may also be used\nfor axial turbines but with lowered resolution of flows about blunt leading and\ntrailing edges. The analysis method is\nvalid for subsonic, transonic, and supersonic flows, including choked flows.\nA separate program, MESH3D, generates a finite-difference grid from input\ncoordinates of the hub, tip, and blade\nand computes metric derivations and\nblade curvatures at the grid points.\n\nThese data are stored in files used by\nBLADE3D.\nThe BLADE3D analysis program uses\nMacCormack\'s explicit time-marching\nfinite-difference algorithm in split\noperator form to solve the unsteady\nEuler equations. This technique captures shock waves automatically and\nsmears them over several grid points. Input to BLADE3D consists of the bladerow operating conditions. Output quantities are three velocity components, density, and internal energy at each grid\npoint, which may be printed or stored as\na solution file.\nA third program, GRAPH3D, is used\nfor postprocessing BLADE3D solution\nfiles . From these files GRAPH3D calculates total pressures, mach numbers,\nand streamline locations and produces\nsome printerlplotter output. The calculated data may be stored for use with\nuser-generted graphics routines .\nFlows in several transonic compressors have been analyzed and compared\nwith experimental measurements obtained with conventional probes, a gas\nfluoroscence technique , and laser\nanemometry. These comparisons have\nshown that the computed solutions accurately model the measured shock positions and flow fields.\nThe programs are written in FORTRAN IV. They were developed on a\nDEC PDP-11/70 and an IBM 3033, but\nhave also been run on a Cray-1 , an IBM\n3601078, a UNIVAC 110, and a CDC\n7600 with little or no modification .\nThis program was written by William\nJ.

The program supports both spinning and\ninertially-fixed despun spacecraft and includes modeling for either a hydrazine\nor a Freon propulsion system.\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1983\n\nFor each modeled maneuver GMAN\nproduces a detailed history of the\nspacecraft orbital parameters, attitude\nparameters, mass properties, propulsion-system performance parameters,\nsensor coverage data, and ground\ncoverage data. Routine maneuver computations and maneuver analysis are\nalso incorporated.\nThe GMAN consists of a main driver,\ntwo subdrivers, and four top-level utilities. The main driver controls program\nflow as well as main function initialization. Each subdriver performs a main\nfunction in the development of a final\nmaneuver computation .\nThe GMAN currently performs two\nmain functions : orbit propagation and\ntargeting . Associated with the orbit propagation driver is the orbit integrator utility. Associated with the targeting driver\nare the other three top-level utilities: orbit coarse, attitude coarse, and fine\ntargeting . The coarse targeting employs\ntwo-body impulsive assumptions in\ndeveloping first estimates on ignition\ntime, the length of burn, and necessary\nspacecraft-control information. The fine\ntargeting employs a detailed spacecraft\nmodel and allows testing of the coarsetargeting estimations through modeling\nof a finite burn.\nThe GMAN is written in FORTRAN IV\nand Assembler for batch execution and\nhas been implemented on an IBM\n360-series computer with a centralmemory requirement of approximately\n530K of 8-bit bytes.

It was developed with the\nassumption that great emphasis would\nbe placed on balanced-radius profiles\nand that alternate-radius missions would\nbe of interest as tradeoff information.\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1983\n\nTherefore, the program produces accurate performance results for all mission segments while minimizing the\nrepetitive calculations normally required\nto balance radii and develop radius\ntrades.\nThis program has been used at the\nNASA Langley Research Center to\ndetermine critical operational requirements and to determine areas\nwhere research programs would be expected to yield the most beneficial\nresults. In turn , the results of research\nefforts have been evaluated in terms of\naircraft performance on selected mission segments and for complete mission\nprofiles.\nThe program is a combination of five\nmission modules that represent mission\nprofiles currently of interest. Each mission module is designed to determine\nthe combat radius or range capability for\na specific mission with its associated\nground rules and profile definitions. Several of these mission profiles contain optional profile segments for use in representing alternate missions. The modules\nconcept permits the. addition of new\nmodules, or the modification of existing\nmodules, to represent new or unusual\nmission-profile specifications. Input to\nthe program includes extensive propul~ion data, aerodynamic data, aircraft\nweight data, and mission requirements.\nFor each requested flight point, an extensive set of aircraft state variables and\nacceleration rates are output.\nThis program is written in FORTRAN\nIV for batch execution and has been implemented on CDC CYBER 175-series\ncomputers with a central-memory requirement of approximately 114K (octal)\nof 60-bit words.

These data are then used\nto generate presentation plots that display the ellipt ical orbit performance\ncapability of the space booster.\nThe ELOPE program employs data\ninterpolation and a two-body energy\nequation to calculate the parametric\nperformance data. The input to the program consists of parametric data on altitude, velocity, and payload weight at\norbit insertion. These data are usually\nobtained from a user-supplied trajectory\nsimulation program.\nTrajectory simulations with various\nvalues of payload weight and vehicle\npitchover rate are used to generate the\ninput data. The ELOPE program interpolates these data at the perigee altitudes\nof interest for each payload weight. The\nperigee is assumed to be at the point of\ninsertion, the point at which the booster\nperformance is at its maximum. The resulting interpolated data at each specific\nperigee are themselves interpolated for\nthe range of payloads of interest.\nValues of the perigee velocities are\nconverted to apogee altitudes by solving\nthe two-body energy equation. Thus the\nparametric orbital performance is calculated and plotted for a specified range of\nperigee altitudes. In addition, the program can calculate the payload weights\nthat correspond to a circular orbit, an\nEarth escape orbit, and a user-specified\norbit.\nThe ELOPE program is written in FORTRAN IV for batch execution and has\nbeen implemented on a CDC CYBER\n170-series computer with a centralmemory requirement of approximately\n60K (octal) of 60-bit words.

Special features include options\nfor non-standard-day operation , for balanced field length, for derated throttle to\n\nmeet a given field length for offloaded\naircraft, and for throttle cutback during\nclimbout for community noise alleviation.\nThe program can also be used to investigate advanced takeoff procedures\nfor noise alleviation , such as programed\nthrottle and control flaps.

It can compress working fluids such as helium, nitrogen, or chlorfluorocarbons for Stirlingcycle refrigeration or other purposes.\nThe proposed compressor includes\ntwo mutually opposed ferromagnetic\npistons of the same shape and mass\n(see figure). An electromagnet - the\nmain driving coil - generates a magnetic flux that links both pistons, thus\ncausing a magnetic attraction between\nthem . The symmetrical disposition of the\npistons on either side of the coil and the\nequal piston masses insure that the resulting piston motions are of substantially equal and oPPOsite momenta. Since\nthe net momentum of the machine parts\nis close to zero, there is very little reaction force and consequently very little\nvibration .\nThe magnetizable pistons, in combination with flexible diaphragms, confine the working fluid. The pressure of\nthe working fluid tends to force the\npistons apart. However, the magnetic attraction between the pistons draws\nthem together, thereby compressing the\nworking fluid and forcing a portion of it\nthrough a vent pipe. Repeated application of current to the main driving coil\ncauses reciprocating movement of the\npistons and produces surges of compressed working fluid at the vent.\nThe masses of the pistons and the\ncompressibility of the working fluid form\na naturally-resonant "gas-spring " structure. The compressor can be fine-tuned\nby adjusting the frequency of excitation\nof the main driving coil , adjusting\nmechanical springs on the pistons, or by\nchanging the pressure of additional gas\nsprings acting on the pistons and opposing the working fluid.\nIn addition to the main driving electromagnet coil , there are four quadrant\ncoils to insure that the two pistons remain in alinement. The quadrant coils\nare operated in pairs, one pair augmenting the flux produced by the main coil\nand the other pair partially canceling the\nmain-coil flux. The quadrant coils thus\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1983\n\nPRESSURE\n\n--1~~~~\n\nOSCILLATIONS ....\nTO DRIVEN\nSYSTEM\n\nPulses of Magnetic Flux through enlarged parts of the two pistons pull the pistons\ntogether.

A\nreciprocating movement is thus set up, and the pressure oscillations are coupled out to\nbe used to drive a Stirling-cycle refrigerator or other system.\n\nproduce controllable torques on the\npistons.\nThe currents in the quadrant coils are\nregulated in response to the outputs of\ncapacitive radial-displacement sensors\nin metal or metalized tubes extending\nfrom the pistons. The sensors are\nenergized by high-frequency signals\nfrom the control circuitry.

It implements either of two control algorithms to follow the coal/rock interface, removing as much coal as possible without cutting into rock.\n\nA guidance and control system automatically positions the cutting drums of a\ndouble-ended longwall shearer so that\nthey follow a coal seam .The system determines the location of the upper interface\nbetween coal and shale and continuously\nadjusts the cutting-drum positions, upward or downward, to track the undulating interface. The objective is to keep the\ncutting edges as close as practicable to\nthe interface and thus extract as much\ncoal as possible from a seam.\nThe system employs the following\nsensors:\n\n254\n\n- Downface Distance Sensor measures the distance of the shearer\nfrom the start of the cut along the face\nof the longwall.\n- Arm-Position Indicators - measure\nthe angular position of the shearer arm\nwith respect to its body.\n- Present-Cut Follower - measures the\nvertical distance between the trailingdrum centerline and the newly cut roof.\n- Last-Cut Follower - measures the vertical distance between the centerline of\nthe lead drum and the previously cut\nroof.\n\n- Coal-Interface Detector - a sodium iodide scintillation detector that measures natural gamma-ray emissions from\nthe rock above the coal : the thickness\nof the coal remaining on the roof is deduced from the attenuation of the gamma rays by the coal.\n- Sensitized Picks -Instrumented With\nStrain Gages - measure cutting force\nto differentiate between cutting coal\nand cutting rock.\nIn addition to the sensors, hardware\nfor the subsystem includes a microprocessor, signal-processing elec-\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter1983\n\ntronies, power supplies, a display, and an\ninterface circuit that converts the control\nsignals to the high-power levels required\nby the shearer. The complete verticalcontrol subsystem is shown schematically in the figure.\nOn the basis of signals from the sensors, the control system follows either of\ntwo strategies. If the seam height is fairly\nconsistent from cut to cut, the controller\nemploys strategy 1, in which the system\nutilizes information about coal thickness\nleft on the roof of the last cut and stored\nin memory as a function of downface distance. The lead-drum controller maintains the drum at a height that keeps the\ncoal roof thickness as close as possible\nto a desired value, subje~t to the constraint that the step size between two\nconsecutive cuts may vary by no more\nthan \xc2\xb1 2 inches ( \xc2\xb1 5.1 cm) from the pre-\n\nset step size. A signal from one of the\nsensitized picks will move the lead drum\naway from the rock, within the allowed\nstep boundaries. The rear drum keeps a\nconstant seam height with reference to\nthe newly cut rool, as directed by the\npresent-cut follower sensor.\nStrategy 2 is similar except that the\ncoal thickness is measured in the present cut as close behind the lead drum as\npossible. The rear drum is controlled as\nin strategy 1.\nThe operator can switch from\nautomatic control to manual control by\npushing a button either on the machine\nor on a remote radio-control module. Ordinarily, the operator monitors the\nshearer from the distance allowed by the\nradio module.

Such a pump would be\nincorporated into a self-contained\ntransportable module along with the\nengine and controls. A module would be\ncarried by a helicopter, a boat, or a van\nto the site of a fire. It would provide large\nquantities of water at high pressure in\nthe firefighting mode or would pump the\noil into a barge in the salvage mode. The\nfiretighting module is described in\n"Light, Compact Pumper for Harbor\nFires" (M FS-25784), NASA Tech Briefs\nVol 7, No. 2 (Winter, 1982), page 199. A\npicture of the module in action appears\non the cover of Vol. 6, NO.3 (FalllWinter,\n1981).\nThe use of such a pump to unload\ncargo into a barge (see figure) will allow\na vessel to be refloated or allow the trim\nor hull of a vessel to be corrected. It can\nprevent large monetary losses for the\ncargo owner. For example, a damaged\nvessel may well carry 9.B million barrels\n(1.6 x 106 m3) of crude oil with a market\nvalue of $343 million (1982 dollars).

Dual oil/water pumping units\nwere found to be clearly feasible\ntechnically. They are also attractive\n\neconomically since the dual functions\nallow a higher utilization, which eventually translates into lower cost.\nTwo pump configurations have been\ndeveloped to cover the range of\nviscosities. Both normal and light crude\noils can be unloaded efficiently by a centrifugal pump. For high-viscosity crude\noils in winter and for such residual oils as\nNo. 6 fuel oil and Navy heavy oil in\nwinter, a screw-type pump will be required. However, the situations requiring a screw pump are much less likely\nthan those for which a centrifugal pump\n\nwill suffice.\nThe centrifugal type of pump appears\nto offer the best prospects for further\ndevelopment.

To prevent overheating and consequent loss of the hot-formed shape,\neach element is protected by a thermostat that turns off current when a predetermined temperature is exceeded.\n\nA proposed electrically controlled actuator would produce a predetermined\nforce, torque, or displacement without\nmotors, solenoids , or gears . Using\nmemory-metal elements, such an actuator would respond to a digital input\n\n256\n\nwithout electronic digital -to-analog\nconversion .\nMemory metals are alloys that quickly\nsnap from their cold-formed shapes to\ntheir stiff hot-formed shapes when a\ncritical temperature is passed. Upon\n\ncooling , they return to their compliant\ncold condition . One memory-metal alloy\nof nickel and titanium can exert a\npressure of 60,000 Ib/in.2 (400 MPa) in\nresponse to a temperature change as\nsmall as 18 0 F (10 0 C).\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1983\n\nIn its simplest form, the actuator comprises several identical memory\nelements in parallel (see figure). Each\nelement is selectively heated by electric\ncurrent when its series switch is closed.\nWhen the temperature of an element\nrises above the critical temperature, the\nelement reverts to its hot-formed shape.\nThe change is rapid, since its source heat - arises within the element itself.\nAs it changes shape or attempts to do\nso, the actuator applies a force to a load.\nActuation may be made even faster by\npassing a bias current through the\nelements to keep them just below their\ncritical temperature.\nWhen cool, the memory metal is\nmalleable and exerts little force: It\ntherefore has no tendency to snap back\nto its cold-formed shape when the current is turned off. If the load exerts a\nunidirectional force on the actuator (for\nexample, if the load is under the influ-\n\nence of gravity or a spring), the load\ntends to restore the actuator to its cold\nshape as it cools. For loads that do not\nrestore the elements to their starting\nshapes and for faster restoration, a second set of memory-metal actuators can\nbe placed in oPPOsition to the first set.\nAnother version of the actuator has\nelements of different thicknesses so that\neach element has twice the stiffness of\nits thinner neighbor. With this binary relationship between elements, binarycoded signals may be used directly to\ncontrol the element switches. The total\nforce exerted by the actuator is then\ndirectly proportional to the applied binary signal. This scheme is particularly\nsuited to computer control and eliminates expensive digital-to-analog converters and precise stabilized amplifiers.\nThe switches may be transistors that\nconnect the elements directly to a supply\nvoltage. Since stiffness is determined by\n\ncross-sectional area, it is directly related\nto resistance. The power drawn by an\nelement is in direct proportion to the heat\nneeded to cause the phase change and is\nhigher for elements of greater stiffness.\nA linear actuator having a greater extension range can be constructed from\nhelical elements. The elements may be\narranged in a binary stiffness relationship, or they may simply be identical.\nA rotary actuator can be formed from\nmemory elements twisted into torsion\nsprings. Again, the elements may be of\nbinary-graded stiffness or of equal stiffness.\nThis work was done by Carl F. Ruoff of\nCaltech for NASA\'s Jet Propulsion\nLaboratory.

The method can be used to determine design requirements for an efficient gearset. The effects of spur-gear\nsize, pitch, ratio, pitch-line velocity, and\nload on efficiency are readily predictable with this method. The analysis uses\nsimple algebraic expressions to determine gear sliding, rolling, and windage\nlosses and also incorporates an approximate ball-bearing power-loss expression. Predicted results have shown good\nagreement with published data.\nA significant source of power loss in\nmany drive systems is due to the gearing. Many methods have been proposed\nto calculate gear-power loss. Most of\nthese methods utilize only a friction coefficient to calculate the gear-power\nloss. Few consider the losses associated with forming an elastohydrodynamic film (rolling traction), gear windage, or those associated with the sup-\n\nport bearings. These latter power-loss\nterms contribute significantly to the\npower loss occurring under part-load\noperation.\nConsideration of these speeddependent loss terms becomes important in determining the cumulative\npower consumption of the machines\nthat spend much of their operating lives\nat less-than-full-power levels. Furthermore, most of these earlier methods do\nnot conveniently account for the effects\nof gear-mesh geometry, such as diametra I pitch, tooth number, width, ratiO,\nand operating conditions on gear-power\nloss.\nThis new method considers four major\nsources of gear-system power losses:\nsliding, rolling, windage, and supportbearing losses. It is applicable to spur\ngears of standard tooth proportions in\nwhich the gears are jet- or splashlubricated. No accounting has been\nmade for churning losses of gears running submerged in oil. The analysis con\xc2\xb7\nsiders sliding losses that are the results\n\nof friction forces developed as teeth\nslide across one another. The sliding\nloss can be found from Ps = C1tVNs,\nwhere f is the friction coefficient, W the\naverage normal load, and Vs the average sliding velocity.\nRolling losses are generated in the\nformation of an elastohydrodynamic\n(EHO) film; that is, oil is squeezed between gear teeth and subsequently\npressurized. The rolling loss is given by\nPR = ~hVTFCR, where ii is the elastohydrodynamic film thickness, V is the\nT\naverage total rolling velocity, F the face\nwidth, and CR the contact ratio (or average number of teeth in contact).\nIn addition to these losses, the\nmethod gives approximate expressions\nto calculate windage losses of the gears\nturning in the airloil gearbox atmosphere\nand the power loss due to the support\nbearings. Windage and bearing losses\ntogether with the rOiling loss often exceed the loss due to sliding alone.\nThe above method circumvents some\nof the limitations associated with earlier\n(continued on next page)\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1983\n\n257\n\n0\n\nPOWER-LOSS BREAKDOWN OCCURS AT\n:roJ.<pm PINION SPEED\n\n0.5\n\n0.4\nTOOTH SlIDING\n\n0.3\nToo~NG RESISTANCE\n\n0.2\n\nGEARSUPPORT BEARING\n\nPlNION-SUPPORT BEARING\n0.1\n\nGEAR WINDAGE\n\no\n\n50\n\nPINION\nWINDAGE\n\n150\n\n100\n\n200\n\npredictive methods and permits the optimization of gear-tooth geometry for best\nefficiency consistent with tooth strength\nand scoring requirements.

Conventional\nbeam-focus detectors employ only a\nsingle whirling tungsten wire.\nIn the single-whirling-wire detector,\nthe potential difference between the\nwire and ground is sampled, and the\ntime the wire spends in the beam is determined. An oscilloscope displays the\nbeam focus as a variable-width peak,\nwhich is monitored as the focus control\nis adjusted. However, the intense beam\nat the sharp focus sometimes melts the\nwire.\nIn contrast, the multiple-wire beamsampling method provides for a simple\nnull-meter focus indication that is easily\ncontrolled by the operator. The detector\nnot only operates at high beam currents\nbut also eliminates the need for an\noscilloscope.\nThe principle of operation of the\nbeam-focus detector is shown in the\nfigure. Two or more wires, located at two\ndifferent heights and separated by insulated spacer rings, sample the beam.\nThe whirling wires sample the beam as\nbefore; but in this case the outputs from\nthe wires are compared by an electronic\ncircuit, and the resulting Signal is fed to a\nnull-meter.

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nAlthough activated by an explosive\ncharge, a new release mechanism differs from an exploding bolt in a key\nrespect - the new mechanism is reusable, whereas an exploding bolt is not.\nOnly the charge has to be replaced for\nthe new device to be ready for service.\nThe new mechanism is illustrated in\nthe figure. It is activated by the detonation of a small explosive charge or the\nrush of a pressurized gas or other fluid\ninto the small chamber above the piston.\nThe force on the piston breaks the\nshearpin that holds it in place. As the piston moves down, the piston rod pushes a\nslider downward . When the slider\nreaches the end of its travel , the rails are\ncompletely withdrawn from grooves in\nthe horizontal shank, and the shank is\nfree to move out through a circular hole\nin the slider. A spring-loaded follower\nthen pushes the shank to the right, out of\nthe sleeve.\nOther advantages of the new mechanism include:\n- Large areas carry the tensile load.\n- The friction load decreases as the\npressurized-chamber volume increases.\n- The shank is completely relaxed before\nrelease.\n- There is no appreciable wear or surface work hardening.\nDesigned to release the external tank\nfrom the Space Shuttle, the device has\npotential industrial applications; for example, in the emergency release of lifting cables from helicopters, cranes, and\nhoists.\n\nSHANK\n\nTAPERED RAIL\nON SLIDER\n\nThe Slider Release Mechanism is reusable.

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nA tweezerlike tool simplifies the installation of screws in places that can be\nreached only through narrow openings.\nWith changes in size and shape, the\nbasic tool concept is applicable to the\nmounting and dismounting of transNASA Tech Briefs, Wlnter1983\n\nformers, sockets, terminal strips, and\nmechanical parts.\nThe tool is made from two pieces of\nsteel wire. As shown in the figure, it includes a long, tapered U-shaped member and a short crossmember that\n\nbridges and slides along the legs of the\n"U" to clamp them together. The ends of\nthe longer piece are bent into approximately-circular open-ended loops in the\nplane perpendicular to that of the "U."\n(continued on next page)\n261\n\nLoose-fitting and slightly-open-ended\nloops on the ends of the shorter member\nengage the longer member.\nFor installation of a part, the loops at\nthe end of the" U" are fitted around the\nmounting screwheads. The crossmember is slid toward the ends of the "u" to\nclamp the tool onto the screws. The tool\nis then used to hold the part in position\nwhile the screws are started into their\nmating holes with a long screwdriver.\nFinally, the crossmember is slid back to\nrelease the tool, and the screws are\ntightened.\nFor removal , the screws are first\nloosened just enough to permit the ends\nof the tool to fit around the screwheads.\nThe crossmember is then slid toward the\nends to clamp the tool on the screws as\nin installation . The screws are turned the\nrest of the way out of their holes, and the\npart is removed by pulling on the tool. In\nthe case of multiwire connectors, this\nmethod of removal eliminates the\ndamage that would otherwise be caused\nby pulling on the wires.\nThis work was done by John P.

With suitable\nmodifications, the concept could also be\napplied to control the speed of electrical\ngenerators, automotive engines, and\nother machinery.\nAn overspeeding helicopter rotor can\nshake the aircraft apart; yet the times\nwhen overspeed is most likely to occurduring abrupt change-of-direction\nmaneuvers or rapid deceleration - are\n\n262\n\nprecisely the times when a pilot\'s attention is diverted. Thus the usual way of\npreventing overspeed by manual control\nof collective pitch can easily be neglected. The proposed system would control the rotor speed even when it is necessary to dissipate power and the\nengine cannot act as a brake. It will eliminate the problems of gear-train resonance at excessive speeds. It will also\neliminate the drive-train-torque impact\nand the sudden increase in power demand upon the engine that occur when\nthe overrunning clutch is reengaged to a\npreviously overspeeding rotor.\n\nWith the new speed-control concept,\na servomechanism , installed as a series\nservo in the collective control system\n(see figure), regulates rotor speed when\nit exceeds a predetermined limit. The\nrotor speed is continuously compared\nwith the limit. When the speed is below\nthe limit, a diode in the servomechanism\ncircuit blocks the comparison signal.\nWhen the speed exceeds the limit, the\nservomechanism becomes active.\nThe servo progressively increases the\ncollective pitch of the rotor blades. The\nrotor thus dissipates overspeed energy\nthrough dynamic braking. The airframe\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1983\n\nand pilot are protected from extreme\npitch excursions by limiting the maximum total pitch change to a small value:\n3 0 are representative, although the\nprecise value depends on the helicopter\ntype.\nBoth instantaneous-proportional and\ntime-integral gain functions are included\nin the servo circuit so that the frequency\nresponse and damping ratio can be adjusted for the particular aircraft.

Johnson Space Center, Hous ton, Texas\nA new valve design includes two poppet/seat combinations that are actuated\nsimultaneously. If one fails, the other\ncontinues to seal against fluid flow. As\nwith the triple-seal valve described in the\nfollowing article, the valve is primarily\nuseful for handling dangerous fluids and\nis lighter and more compact than comparable redundant-valve systems used\nat present.\nThe new valve contains two opposing\npoppets with conical sealing surfaces\nand an O-ring groove in each such surface. Each poppet seals against one of\nthe two conical surfaces of an annular\nseating projection that is part of the\nvalve body.\nIn the non-rotating-poppet version\n(Figure 1), the poppets engage a common axial shaft: one via right-hand\nthreads and the other via left\xc2\xb7hand\nthreads. A knob is attached to the shaft\nat one end. Keys fixed to the valve body\n(continued on next page)\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1983\n\nFigure 1.

Two Rotating Poppets turn together but on opposing threads so that they move toward or away from each other and their seats.\nThe upper version has crossflow like the valve of Figure 1, while the lower version has axial flow.\n\nfit loosely into lengthwise slots in the\npoppets, so that the poppets can move\naxially but cannot rotate. Both the shaft\nand the poppets are equipped with double O-ring stem seals.\nWhen the operator turns the knob to\nthe right, the oPPOsing sets of threads on\nthe shaft pull the poppets in toward each\nother and toward the seats, thus closing\nthe valve. Similarly, a counterclockwise\nknob motion opens the valve .\nIn the rotating-poppet versions (Figure 2), there is no shaft, and the knob is\nfixed to one of the poppets. That poppet\nis keyed to the other in such a way that\n264\n\nthey rotate together but can slide axially\nwith respect to each other. The knob\nengages the valve body via right-hand\nthreads, while the poppet at the far end\nengages the valve body via left-hand\nthreads . Since the poppets rotate\ntogether but on opposite threads, they\nmove toward or away from each other\nas in the nonrotating version. Thus, turning the knob to the right closes the valve\nby seating both poppets, while rotating\nto the left opens the valve by unseating\nthem .\nOne characteristic of the new design\nthat should be noted is that the stem\n\nseals on the upstream side are subjected to high pressure even when the\nvalve is closed. This feature may increase the susceptibility to leakage to\nthe environment, thus precluding use in\nsome hazardous-fluid systems.\nThis work was done by William C.\nHuber of Johnson Space Center.

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nThe handling of poisonous, flammable, or corrosive fluids should be\nmade safer by a new triple-seal valve\nconcept. Three valves would be assembled in series, with the stem mechanism\nfor one valve serving as the body of the\nnext valve. The new design is lighter and\nmore compact than the conventional\nthree-series-valve combinations used\nwith hazardous fluids.\nAccording to the new design, the\nthree valves would be stacked along a\ncommon cylindrical axis (see figure).\nEach valve has three stem seals, with\neach seal at a different diameter so that\na scratch on one cylinder wall is unlikely\nto cause a leak in all three.\nEach stem body has an axial flow passage. The passage diverges into two or\nmore passages at the small end to\ncircumvent a hardened ball that serves\nas the poppet.

Designed to retain a spin-stabilized satellite\nduring launch and spinup in orbit and\neject it into space at high velocity, the\nmechanism may be applicable to some\nkinds of motor starters, drive shafts, or\nother drive systems that must be released while rotating.\nThe mechanism consists of three lugs\non the driven object that reach through\nthe spin table and engage three springloaded pins pressing outwardly against\na stationary retaining cylinder. The lugs,\nspin table, and pins are rotated by an\nelectric motor. For ejection, the spin\ntable is pushed outward (along the spin\naxis) by a pneumatic piston rod . When\nthe three pins clear the retaining\ncylinder, they move radially outward and\ndisengage from the lugs.

However, the motor\nshaft (which operated at up to 1,750\nrpm) was damaged repeatedly because\nit was not designed to withstand the\nstresses.

The method was\ndeveloped for preburners on the Space\nShuttle main engine. A preburner contains a cylindrical central oxidizer post\nsurrounded by a fuel sleeve, with varying\nclearance between the post and the\nsleeve. The cantilevered post tended to\nvibrate as high-pressure fuel impinged\non it and was thus prone to failure.\nThe problem was solved by three\nsmall tubes inserted in the clearance\nbetween the post and the sleeve at\nequally spaced intervals around the circumference of the post and parallel to\nthe post axis. The tubes deform\nelastically as they are inserted and expand partially as the gap becomes\nwider. The tubes are still slightly deformed in their final location in a force fit\nand are thus retained there. They provide the support necessary to dampen\nthe vibrations of the post.\nThis work was done by Theodore C.\nAdams and Premysl Jencek of Rockwell\nInternational Corp. for Marshall Space\nFlight Center.

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nAn improved sewing technique for\nhigh-temperature [750 O-to-1 ,200 \xc2\xb0 F\n(4000-to-650\xc2\xb0 C)] insulating blankets\nprevents stitch failure in hot, turbulent\nenvironments. In the new technique, the\nstandard lockstitch is modified to isolate\nsingle-stitch failures .\nThe insulating blanket consists of a\nfibrous batting sandwiched between a\nquartz-fabric outer facing and a glassfabric inner facing, with nominal total\nthickness ranging from 0.45 to 0.95 in.\n(1 .1 to 2.4 cm). The inner and outer facings are stitched with an outer (needle)\nthread of polytetrafluoroethylenecoated quartz and an inner (bobbin)\nthread of glass, with a stitch density of\n4 \xc2\xb1 1 per in. (1 .6 \xc2\xb1 0.4 per cm).\nIn conventional lockstitching (shown\nin the middle part of figure), a loop of the\nneedle thread is passed through the two\nfacings and caught by the bobbin thread.\nThe needle thread is then pulled back\nuntil the interlacing of both threads is\nmidway between the facings. If the\nthread fails at one stitch, the thread can\nloosen along its entire length, thus unraveling an entire row of stitches.\nIn the improved technique (lower part\nof figure), the bobbin thread is kept at the\nblanket surface. A silicone adhesive is\napplied to all the bobbin/needle intersections, so that a failure at one point will\nnot propagate along the thread.\nThe improved blanket has been\ntested in experiments and is scheduled\nfor use on the Space Shuttle.

The guidance system employs a digital television\ncamera and a microprocessor. It compensates for thermal expansion and intense heat at the jOint. In addition, the\nsystem uses algorithms that minimize\nthe effects of stray light reflection,\nchanges in light level, erroneous signals,\nmomentary loss of Signal, and scratches\non the workpiece.\nThe television camera views the jOint\nto be welded, at a point near the welding\ntorch. The camera and torch are\nmounted on the cross-seam actuator\nand move together over the jOint (see\nfigure). The camera contains a chargeinjection device with 60,512 IIghtsensing elements. It scans each element sequentially, digitizes the lightlevel signal from each, and transmits the\nsignals as 8-bit words to a buffer\nmemory. The memory is updated once\nevery 33 milliseconds.\nThe microprocessor analyzes the\nlight-level signals, determining what\nlevels correspond to the surrounding\nmetal (bright area) and to the joint (dark\nline). The tracking error is computed as\nthe distance (in picture elements) between the joint and the reference picture\nelement.

CW operation was attained at heat-sink temperatures from 12\nto 60 K. The maximum multi mode diode\nCW-output power is 10 to 20 J.lW. These\nlaser diodes have survived 1-month\nstorage at 40 0 C and 1-year storage at\nroom temperature; they have also survived repetitive thermal cycling without\ndegradation.\nMultiple-source MBE offers better\nflexibility and control than other crystalgrowth techniques. Substrate selection,\n\nhowever, is critical. The laser-diode\nfabrication starts with MBE film growth\non a BaF2 substrate and ends with a\nbonded, electrically contacted laser (see\nfigure). A multilayer vertical structure is\ngrown (by MBE) on the substrate.\nTo achieve adequate heat sinking to\npermit CW operation above 12 K, the film\nis removed from the BaF2 and bonded to\na thermal-expansion-matched substrate\nthrough back-surface metalization and a\nlow-temperature soldering to an oxygenfree , high-conductivity copper block. The\nBaF2 is dissolved with a continuous directed stream of warm deionized water.\nAt that point , individual Fabry-Perot\n(continued on next page)\n\n275\n\ncavities are formed photolithographically. The (Pb/Sn)Te mesas are isolated\nfrom each other electrically by a reverse\npn junction but have a common electrical ground and heat sink.\nTo form individual diodes, a fourth\nstep is used in which an insulating layer\nis deposited and contact w indows\nopened. Metal is deposited over the entire top surface and selectively removed\nfrom one face of the diode to permit the\noutput radiation to escape. The structure\nis completed by fastening a contact wire\nto the top-layer metalization beside the\nlaser to avoid the mechanical stress of a\ndirect contact. In this technique , a voidfree solder bond is applied over an area\nof 8 by 10 mm. Stress in the bond is kept\nlow enough to permit the fabrication of\nlasers from the soldered material.\nAlthough the laser diodes are conventionally fabricated from cleaved semiconductor material, the technique employs wet-chemical etching for the formation of the laser cavities. As an alternative to forming Fabry-Perot cavities ,\nion milling also h9,s been used, permitting improved geometric definition as\ncompared to the wet-chemical etching.\nThe finished diode has the top contact\nadjacent to the mesa, rather than on top\nof it. This structure offers considerably\nless strain than the conventional sandwich structure and is expected to be\nmore reliable during thermal cycling .\nThis work was done by M. D.

There is no reactive solvent to become entrapped in the\nrecesses in the equipment and cause\ncorrosion .\nA stream of small , frozen pellets is\ndirected at the assembly to be cleaned.\nThe pellets could consist of deionizedwater ice, carbon dioxide ice, or another\nsubstance that does not react chemical-\n\n276\n\nIy with the parts to be cleaned and leaves\nno residue. The pellets abrade away dirt\nand contaminants.

Therefore, after grit\nblasting, the assembly is placed in a\nvacuum, then purged with hot air or\nnitrogen to remove the traces of pellet\n\nmaterial.\nThe method is well suited to cleaning\ntitanium and parts that touch liquid oxygen.

The process would\nresult in structures that are strong, light,\nand durable. It could be used to mass\nproduce other lightweight parts besides\nbeams.\nPolysulfone was selected as the\nmatrix material because it does not\noutgas excessively in the vacuum of\nspace . In contrast , thermosetting\nmaterials, such as liquid matrices and\npre impregnating resins, present serious\noutgassing problems in such an environment.\nThe tape would consist of three layers\nhaving graphite fiber orientations of 0\xc2\xb0,\n45\xc2\xb0, and 0\xc2\xb0, respectively. The process\n(see figure) would begin with the tape\nfeeding through a series of stations in\nwhich it is first heated along the fold\nlines for the triangular cross section and\nthen folded into an equilateral triangle\nwith a lap seam along one corner .

The\npolyurethane causes less contamination\nof the plating bath and of the cleaning\nand filtering tanks than do the wax fillers\nused previously. The direct cost of\nmaintenance and the indirect cost of\nreduced operating time during tank\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, Wlnter1983\n\ncleaning are therefore reduced.\nA polyurethane-foam filler is easily\nprepared by mixing an isocyanate with a\npolyol. It is also easily removed with\nmethyl chloride.\nSince the foam filler is less dense than\nwax, foam-filled parts are lighter in\nweight than wax-filled parts. The use of\npolyurethane foam also speeds the prep-\n\naration of parts to be plated: Considerable time must otherwise be spent waiting for the wax to cool after pouring into\nthe slots before masking can be done.\nThis work was done by John L.\nBeasley of Rockwell International Corp.\nfor Marshall Space Flight Center.

The concept is applicable to such hightemperature chambers as rocket preburners , turbojet cans , stationaryturbine combustors, oil burners, and\nhigh-pressure chemical reactors.\nThe proposed liner is a rigid structure\njoined to the outershell (see Figure 1),\nwith internal ribs that define channels.\nCoolant gas flows freely and uniformly\nthrough the channels, providing dependable heat removal.\nWith fixed , predetermined channel\ncross sections, coolant flow is easy to\ncontrol. The ribs bet\'ween channels act\nas heat-transfer fins , increasing the\nheat-exchange area and accommodating bursts of excess heat from the chamber. The high-conductivity metals used in\nthe new liner - copper or nickel - further improve heat-transfer capacity.\nThe fabrication of such a liner begins\nwith the electroforming of a layer of copper or nickel on the shell (Figure 2).\nChannels are milled in this layer. The\nchannels are filled with a wax or other\ntemporary material , and a final layer of\nmetal is electroformed over the channels. Since this fabrication process takes\nplace at or slightly above room temperature, the heat-treated metal shell is not\nweakened.\nA conventional liner consists of a\nsheet-steel cylinder inside the structural\nshell , separated from the shell by a narrow gap. Cooling fluid flowing along the\ncylinders in the gap removes heat from\nthe liner. This type of liner can be\nweakened and its shape distorted by\nbrazing or welding in fabrication or by\n\nSTEEL LINER\n\nCOMBUSTION\nZONE\n\nOLD\n\nNEW\n\nFigure 1.

The technique has\nbeen used successfully on nickel alloys\nand aluminum alloys and may be effective on steel and titanium .\nSpiking - uneven penetration of the\nweld in the metal - occurs when the\nforces of vaporization and surface tension become unbalanced . When an\nelectron beam delivers energy to a\nworkpiece, it vaporizes a conical hole in\nthe metal and melts the metal adjacent\nto the hole. In the desired operating\nmode, the pressure of the metal vapor\nprevents the surface tension of the\nmolten metal from closing up the hole.\nIf the beam energy is strongly concentrated at the apex of the hole, then\nthe temperature difference between the\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, Wlnter1983\n\nhotter bottom (apex) of the hole and the\ncooler top becomes considerable. Since\nthe vapor pressure increases while the\nsurface tension decreases with increasing temperature, the surface tension at\nthe top of the hole sometimes wins out\nover the vapor pressure. When this\nhappens, the top closes, and the rim intercepts the beam. Less energy is delivered to the bottom, and penetration is\ntemporarily decreased. Then suddenly\nthe surface vaporizes, the rim recoils,\nthe surface cools, and the cycle begins\nagain. The result is a weld the depth of\nwhich varies somewhat irregularly along\nthe length of the weld. Frequently, such\na weld contains voids along its bottom\nsurface.\nIn the new technique, a strip of metal\nhaving a vapor pressure higher than that\nof the base metal at the same tempera-\n\nture is placed in a slot machined along\nthe weld line (see figure). The strip\nvaporizes as the beam strikes it, and its\nvapor pressure keeps surface tension\nfrom closing off the top of the channel.\nAluminum alloy 5083 (94 percent\naluminum, 5 percent magnesium, and 1\npercent manganese) was selected for _ _\nthe first test of the new technique. Slots . . . .\n0.032 by 0.120 inch (0.81 by 3 mm) were\nmilled in blocks of the alloy, and pieces\nof mangnesium ribbon ranging in size\nfrom 9.8 to 39.2 mg per cm were laid in a\npart of each slot. A sharply-focused\nelectron beam was moved along the\nslots. The resulting welds were sectioned, and a reduction of spiking was\nevident in the portions of the slots that\nhad contained magnesium ribbons.\n(continued on next page)\n\n279\n\nTests of manganese ribbon in a slot in\na nickel alloy were also made. Spiking\nwas eliminated almost entirely. More investigation is needed to determine how\nmuch manganese is needed. Moreover,\nthe metallurgical effects of adding\nmanganese are yet to be determined.\nManganese is a brittle metal; and if it\ndoes not mix well in the alloy, it may produce weak areas.\nThere are alternative metals: In the\norder of increasing vapor pressure, they\nare chromium, gold, copper, aluminum,\nsilver, lead , bismuth , and antimony.\n{There are others, but their chemistry or\nprice makes them poor candidates.}\nLead, bismuth, and antimony have such\nenormous vapor pressures compared\nwith nickel that they may evaporate\nentirely after they do their job of fighting\ntension. They therefore may have no effect on the metallurgy of the final weld.\nThis work was done by Roy E. Olson of\nRockwell International Corp. for Marshall Space Flight Center. No further\ndocumentation is available.\nInquiries concerning rights for the\ncommercial use of this invention should\nbe addressed to the Patent Counsel,\nMarshall Space Flight Center [see page\nA5J.

The ribbon\nshould have a higher vapor pressure than that of the base metal at the same temperature\nand should not adversely affect the metallurgy of the final weld.\n\nLess-Costly Ion Implantation of Solar Cells\nBroad-beam phosphorus could be used instead\nof a single mass-analyzed ionic species.\nNASA \'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California\nExperiments at NASA\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory point the way toward\nmore relaxed controls over ion-implantation dosage and uniformity in solar-cell\nfabrication . If the preliminary results\nhold up when the methods are scaled up\nto production runs, the complexity and\ncost of cell fabrication would be\nlowered, and production rates would be\nincreased.\nThese results were obtained for\nphosphorus-doped silicon solar cells .\nPreviously, it was thought necessary to\nfilter the ion beam from a red-phosphorus source before it strikes the silicon\nsubstrate. Filtering through a mass\nspectrometer isolates one phosphorus\nspecies; for example,\nor P+ .

The data also show that\nthe cell performance is relatively insensitive to dosage above about 2 x 1015\natoms/cm 2. Thus, strict control over\ndosage may be unnecessary, and possibly more importantly - a broader\nless uniform beam can be used, thereby\nincreasing throughput.\nThe three principal constituents of the\nphosphorus ion beam, P2+, P+ , and\nP4+, were implanted separately into\nsilicon samples. The figure shows the\noutput current density of solar cells\nfabricated with these constituents. For\nsimplicity, it was assumed that the maximum power point was at about 400\nmillivolts; therefore, the current density\nat 400 mV was used as a figure of merit\nfor cell performance.\n\nThe samples were ion-implanted at a\ndose of 2 x 1015 atoms/cm 2 over a\nrange in energy from 5 to 40 keV/atom.\nNote that a P.t ion implanted at 80 keY\nis equivalent to four phosphorus atoms\nimplanted at 20 keY, therefore, the actual dose is four times larger than the\n"apparent " dose measured by integrating the sample current and the\nenergy per atom is four times less than\nthe ion accelerating potential.\nOnly a few samples were implanted\nfor each point in the figure. However, it is\napparent that there is no clear-cut\ndistinction in performance between the\nmolecular phosphorus and the atomic\nphosphorous ions. Other data (not\n\nshown) appear to display a general trend\ntoward improved performance as the\nimplant energy is decreased.\nThe effect of the implant dose on the\npower output was evaluated using the\nP2+ molecular ion. These data show a\ndefinite decrease in performance as the\ndose is decreased below about 1 X 1015\natomstcm 2. The data also show that the\nperformance is substantially constant at\nhigher dosages.\nThis work was done by Dennis J.\nFitzgerald of Caltech for NASA\'s Jet\nPropulsion Laboratory.

The method was\ndeveloped for assembling structural\nelements made of composite materials.\nAs shown in the figure, thin wires are\nclipped on the tapered end of a tubular\nelement. A liquid adhesive is then applied to the tapered section. The tapered\nsection is inserted in a tapered countersunk hole in a tube of slightly larger\ndiameter. The adhesive is allowed to\ncure, and a strong jOint is formed.\nThe spacing wires prevent the adhesive from being scraped away when the\ntubes are pushed together. A uniform\nlayer is thus maintained over the bonding surfaces, and bond strength is thereby improved. The tapered section allows\nthe bonding surfaces to be wedged together so that they provide pressure\nwhile the adhesive cures .

The\nvise allows crystals as thin as 2\nmillimeters or less to be positioned so\nthat they can be cleaved without\nbreakage. Previously, the crystal had to\nbe carefully measured, clamped in a jig,\nand painstakingly centered under a\ncleaving blade by an operator.\nIn the new vise (see Figure 1) the jaws\nare fitted with ball bushings that ride on\nguide rods. The guide rods support the\njaws and maintain their alinement,\nthereby maintaining the crystal or other\nworkpiece in alinement. The bushings\nreduce both starting friction and sliding\nfriction so that the <:>perator always has a\ngood tactile sense of the forces on the\njaws:\nThe adjusting screw has a right-hand\nthreaded portion that passes through\none jaw and has a left-hand threaded\nportion that passes through the other\njaw. Each threaded portion engages a\nthreaded collar bushing in its respective\njaw. Thus, the jaws move in opposite\ndirections - together or apart - when\nthe operator turns the knob on one end\nof the screw.\nThe operator places the crystal workpiece on a horizontal support surface in\nthe vise so that the crystal lies between\nthe protruding toes of the vise jaws (see\nFigure 2). The spring-loaded jaws\nengage opposite faces of the crystal\nnear its base, pressing gently from both\nsides. The jaw configuration leaves the\ncrystal free to splay apart under the impact of the cleaving blade with little\nhorizontal restraint and minimal damping of the impact shock wave.\nThe workpiece is centered under the\nblade when both toes engage it. Thus ,\nthe blade strikes the crystal at its midpoint so that shock wave is equally\ndistributed on both sides of the midpoint\nand cannot shatter the crystal. When inserting the workpiece in the vise, the\noperator turns a knurled knob to drive\nthe jaws toward each other. When the\nrigid jaws make contact, the workpiece\n\n282\n\nROLLING\nBEARING\n\nFigure 1. The Crystal-Cleaving Vise holds a workpiece firmly but gently.

The technique, which combines the best features\nof ultrasonic rotary seam welding and\nultrasonic spot bonding, allows for fast\nbond cycles and high indexing speeds\nwithout the use of solder or flux . It\nachieves reliable bonds at production\nrates without damage to the solar cells.\nThe new ultrasonic bonding tool\nshown in the figure employs a carbide\nwedge that is inserted into the horn of\nthe ultrasonic transducer . The tool\nengages only the area to be bonded.\nInitially, the wedge descends on the\nworkpiece at an angle so that only a portion of the tool contacts the aluminum\ninterconnect ribbon. As ultrasonic\npower is applied, the tool rolls through a\nsmall angle, progressively bonding the\nentire area, similar to the action of a\nrotary seam welder.\nThe rolling ultrasonic system bonds\nthe cells several times faster than the\nrotary seam welder. It subjects the cells\nto less localized stress, resulting in less\nor no damage to the cells . In addition ,\nthe lower mass of the new bonding head\npermits the use of two parallel heads in\nthe same bonding station.

Excess potting\nfoam is contained within the fence so that\nit fills the shell as foam settles within it.\nThe cured foam in the shell is light in\nweight, rugged , and minimizes thermal\nand mechanical stresses.\n\nA new packaging technique seals\nelectronic modules as effectively as\ndoes potting in epoxy, yet permits the\nremoval of the encapsulant when a component change is necessary. The technique encloses a module in a thin , rigid\nepoxy/fiberglass shell containing a\nlightweight syntactic foam. The foam is\nmade from glass microballoons and an\nepoxy powder that cures at 100\xc2\xb0 C.\nA potting shell in the new technique is\ncomposed of epoxy/fiberglass sheets\n0.20 in. (5.1 mm) thick, bonded at their\nedges with an adhesive. The shell is supported by a terminal-board base 0.031 in.\n(0.79 mm) thick. An aluminum tube extends through the shell and base to\nremove heat generated by the components in the module.\nThe shell has two holes on one of its\nfaces for filling the interior with potting\ncompound . A temporary fence is taped\nto the sides of the shell so that the shell\ncan be overfilled with the foam (see figure). The module is vibrated initially so\nthat additional foam flows to the interior.\nAs the foam settles further during curing,\n\nadditional material flows into the shell\nfrom the overfill volume.\nThe resulting encapsulant is a rigid,\nlow-density material with the consistency of sandstone. Excess material is\ncut away after the cure, and the exposed\nfoam in the fill holes is sealed with\npolyurethane.\nWhen the module has to be reopened,\nthe shell is cut away with a temperaturecontrolled electric hot knife. The foam\naround the component to be reworked is\nthen removed by blasting with ground\nwalnut shells. Residual foam particles\nare blown away with a dry nitrogen jet.\nAfter the component has been removed and replaced, the sides of the\nshell are replaced and rebonded. A new\nfence is erected around the face with fill\nholes (positioned over the new component), and the foam-potting procedure\nis repeated.\nThis work was done by Paul C. Dozois\nand Robert C.

Before this\ndevelopment, the material for anisotropic photoelastic studies has not been\nreadily available. Existing fabrication\ntechniques produced materials with limitations in mechanical and optical\nproperties.\nThe new laminates are glass-fiberreinforced plastiCS for which the matrix\nand fibers have the same index of refraction. Such transparent fibrous com-\n\n284\n\nposites can be made to simulate the anisotropy of opaque fibrous composites,\nsuch as boron/epoxy, graphite/epoxy,\nand others. The transparent composites\ncan be treated as homogeneous materials with anisotropic elastic and optical\nproperties.\nThe matrix resin used to produce the\northotropic birefringent laminates has a\npot life of several hours and cures at\nroom temperature with a minimum\namount of shrinkage, producing a waterclear casting. Type 1062 glass roving is\nused as reinforcement. The glass roving\nis dry-wound over various metal frames\nin a filament-winding machine.\n\nEight-ply unidirectional plates are prepared as well as angle-ply ( + 452/- 452)\nplates and quasi-isotropic plates. A\nmeasured quantity of the epoxy resin\nand hardener is mixed, and half is\npoured on one side of the winding and\nspread as uniformly as possible. The wet\nlayup is then covered with a release\nsheet, the plate turned over, the remaining half of the resin poured on it and\nspread, and the plate covered with\nanother release sheet.\nThe frame with the wet layup between\nthe release sheets is mounted over a\nplywood plate with a square cutout and\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, Wlnter1983\n\nplaced in an autoclave press between\ntwo steel plates. The assembly is\ncovered with glass cloth to provide\nvacuum passage and with a rubber\nblanket. Full vacuum is drawn and a\nmechanical pressure of 655 kPa (95 psi)\napplied. The vacuum is cut off after 30\nminutes and the plate cured under\npressure at room temperature in approximately 18 hours.\nThe same procedures are used in the\nfabrication of thicker laminates. Sixt~en\xc2\xad\nply laminates of the following layups\nwere fabricated: (016), (+ 4521- 45ms,\nand (021 + 452/- 452/902)s. Twice as\nmany windings and twice as much resin\nare used compared with the eight-ply\nlaminates, and the plates are cured\nunder similar conditions . The birefringence response of the laminates remains linear up to at least a fringe order\nof 4 corresponding to a uniaxial tensile\nstress of 310 MPa (45,000 psi).\n\nThe availability of transparent composite laminates of various layups\nmakes it possible to conduct macromechanical stress anslyses by means of\nanisotropic photoelasticity. Stress distributions around such stress raisers as\nholes, cracks, and other defects can be\nstudied experimentally; thickness effects can be studied using the thicker\nlaminates. The properties of transparency and birefringence can be utilized in\nstudying failure modes in notched and\nunnotched laminates, failure initiation,\nand failure propagation. The use of stereoscopic photography can be investigated as a means of determining the location of flaws and failures through the\nthickness.\nThe study of failure initiation in the\nform of microcracks between fibers in\nvarious plies during cyclic fatigue is of\ngreat importance and could be greatly\nfacilitated with transparent composites.\n\nThe ability to see and locate flaws easily\nshould help in studying the influence and\nfailure growth of the flaws during service\nloading. Furthermore, the ability to\ndetect and characterize flaws optically\ncan serve to set standards for the\ncalibration of conventional nondestructive evaluation instruments. The method\nof anisotropic photoelasticity can be further utilized in structural applications of\ncomposites, such as in bonded or bolted\njoints.\nThis work was done by I. M. Daniel and\nT.

This\nprocess allows the use of a stop etch\nthat selectively removes InP and does\nnot etch InGaAsP, making the fabrication especially convenient.

The airlock\nwould be inexpensive, simple to assemble, adaptable to any terrain and any\nsize required, and require no external\npower.\nThe airlock passageway is a polymerfilm tube, sealed at one end, that is supported by an aluminum frame.

A vent in\nthe dome door is then opened to pressurize the passageway so that the door\ncan be opened. Exiting the dome is a\nstraightforward procedure: the door and\nits vent are closed and the tube is unzipped.\nThis work was done by Peter O.\nFrickland and Edward L.

The study suggests that a\ncombination of pulse\xc2\xb7position modulation and Reed-Solomon coding would\ngive a signaling efficiency of 3 or 4\nbits/photon . Although this is less than the\ntheoretical maximum, it is substantially\nmore than the 1.44 bits/photon capacity\nof linear-amplification methods.\nIn pUlse-position modulation (PPM)\nthe transmission interval is divided into\nconsecutive blocks of q slots each. In\neach such block, a laser is pulsed in one\n(and only one) of the slots at a fixed intensity. Each of the resulting q signal\npatterns is considered to be a character\nin the sender\'s alphabet.\nAt the receiver is a device that\ndetects the presence or absence of\nphotons in each timeslol. For example, if\nq = 4, the possible characters are\nrepresented by 0001,0010,0100, 1000,\nand the "erasure" symbol 0000, which\nis reported if the transmitted photons\nare not detected.\n\nINFORMATION RATE IN BITSIPHOTON\n\nINFORMATION RATE IN BITS/PHOTON\n\n1.0\n\n0 ~__~__~__~__~~~\n5.0\n\n2.0\n\n3.0\n\n5.0\n\nO~--~---r--~~--r-~\n\n-1\n\n-1\n\n-2\n\n-2\n\niii -3\n\n\xc2\xa7 -3\n\n~\n::;\n\niii\n\n\xc2\xab\n\nco\n0\n\nII:\n\n\xc2\xab\n\nco\n\n0\n\n-4\n\nII:\n\nQ.\n\n0\n\nII:\nII:\n\n~\n~\n\n8\n..J\n\n-4\n\nQ.\n\nII:\n\nII:\n\n0\n\n-5\n\nII:\nII:\n\n-5\n\nw\n\n-0\n\n-7\n\nIF\n0\n\n-7\n-8\n-9 ~\n\n-6\n\n..J\n\n-6\n\n-8\n__\n\n~\n\n__\n\n~\n\n__- L_ _\n\n~\n\n_ _~\n\n-9 L-__\n\nUNCODED\n\n~\n\n__- L_ _\n\n~\n\n_ _ _ _~~\n\nREED-SOLOMON\nCOOED\n\nThe Performances of Uncoded and Coded PPM are compared in terms of error probability\nand information rate.\n\nReed-Solomon error-correcting codes\ncan be used to "fill in" most of the\nerasures that occur in this way.

The system was designed to eliminate situations that can\ntie up disk space and lead to confusion\nwhen different programers develop different versions of the same programs\nand their associated files.\nARCH can handle any of the three\ntypes of Files-l1 file formats (indexed,\nsequential , and relative), with a given\ntype of file being allowed to have any arbitrary contents. The files are initially\nstored on disk with eventual movement\nto tape storage. A complete history is\nmaintained by means of a directory file\ncontaining a list of the entire contents of\neach backup tape. Each tape also contains enough information to effect a system recovery.\nDuring archiving, ARCH copies a file\ninto a special disk directory and makes\n\nan extensive entry for the file in the internal catalogs. The file is changed to internal format, and two classes of usersupplied comments may be added: a\n(short) summary description and a (long)\ndetailed description. Groups of files from\nthis special disk directory can be moved\nonto tape. The system can always be restored to the state it had at the time of\nthe latest backup-tape generation,\nshould a catastrophic disk failure occur.\nSeveral features aid the user in\nsearching for a particular file among the\narchived files to eliminate the unnecessary "dearchiving" offiles. When a file is\nretrieved (dearchived), the new user file\nduplicates the original file with the option\nof adding the user-supplied archive\n(continued on next page)\n\n295\n\nt]\n\ncomments. An internal help facility provides assistance in all phases of the\nARCH system.\nPrivileged management functions\nprovided by ARCH include commands\nthat allow initialization or restoration of\nthe special disk directory, commands\nthat allow recalculation (realphabetization) of the index of files resident on disk,\nand a command that will locate those\nfiles in the special disk directory that are\nnot known to the system. There are also\nsubsidiary programs that allow listing\nthe contents of the catalog files, checking the integrity of the system, and calculating how much space is taken up by\nfiles that have not been moved to tape.\nThe ARCH system is written in FORTRAN and VAX-11 MACRO-32, Assembler and has been implemented on a\nDEC VAX-11/780 operating under VMS\n3.2. ARCH should be compatible with\nany machine of the DEC VAA family running VMS 3.0 or higher. The ARCH system was developed in 1983.\nThis program was written by John L.\nFanselow and John L.

These Monte Carlo simulations\nare resorted to whenever the systems\nbeing studied are not amenable to\ndeterministic analyses or when direct\nexperimentation is not feasible. Random\nnumbers having a certain specified distribution characteristic are an integral part\nof these simulations. This package consists of a collection of " pseudo-random "\nnumber generators for use in Monte\nCarlo simulations . They are called\n" pseudo-random " because they are\ngenerated by numerical algorithms.\nThe basic element in all Monte Carlo\nsimulations is the uniform randomnumber generator. All other distributions\ncan be obtained either by the probability\nintegral transformation or by applying\nsome known relationship between the\ndesired distribution and the uniform\ndistribution.\n\n296\n\nThe uniform random-number generator in this package is based on the\ncentral-limit method.

All the generators\nare constructed with emphasiS on speed\nand accuracy.\nThe generators in this package are\nwritten in APL for batch execution.

The\ndata bases are typically used for engineering and mission analysis tasks and,\nunlike most commercially available systems, allow data items and data structures to be stored in forms suitable for\ndirect analytical computation. The SPIRE\nDBMS is designed to support data requests from interactive users as well as\nfrom applications programs. The following description is related to interactive\nuse of the DBMS via a "Relational\nCalculus" known as Query-by-Example\n(QBE).\nUser interaction with the SPIRE DBMS\nvia a CRT or hard-copy terminal provides\nfor the easy and timely access to the\nuser\'s data while still allowing a full range\nof retrieval and manipulative capabilities. The SPIRE DBMS readily accommodates both the new user who knows very\nlittle about data-base management and\nthe more sophisticated user who can\noperate at a lower level in the system.\nSPIRE includes a supervisor that\nemploys a password security procedure\nto limit user access to the system, to data\nfiles, and to various commands .\nThe QBE provides a "user-specific\nview" of how a set of data ought to be\nrelated in a user-friendly environment\nalong with data retrieval and manipula-\n\ntive capabilities . Through the QBE\nlanguage, the user interacts with the\nSPIRE DBMS as though examining and\nmanipulating a set of tables. This is\nachieved by allowing each user to develop a template for a set of data in terms of\nthe user "view."\nThe important characteristic of the\ntemplate, as far as the user is concerned, is that it is in a record layout\nform. The QBE allows each and every\nuser to have a different " view" of a common set of data. Further, the user may\n"view" a data base as containing\nrecords that are made up of parts of explicit data-base records or transformations of explicit data-base records , such\nas a subset of the existing range of\nvalues in a given field. In the simplest\ncase, a user "view" may be nothing\nmore than renaming the existing field\nand record names in a given data base.\nAlmost every user interaction with a\nrelational data-base system results in\nmore data-base components (i.e., relations). Results of a request remain in the\nsystem, look like part of the workspace\nfile, and are available to the user as database components.\nThe QBE language includes the\nBoolean operators OR, AND , and NOT\nand the arithmetic operators LESS\nTHAN, LESS THAN OR EQUAL, EQUAL,\nGREATER THAN, and GREATER THAN\nOR EQUAL for aiding the user in making\na request. The JOIN operator allows the\nuser to create new data from existing data.\nThe QBE also includes two functions:\nOne sums the contents of a numeric field\nfor "data records " satisfying selection\ncriteria, and the other counts the number\nof "data records " that satisfy selection\ncriteria. Thus, with QBE the user can\nreadily request; for example, "the\nnumber and the sum of checks of\namounts greater than $100 written to\nXYZ, Inc., in the month of June."\nAlthough the QBE language is not a true\nEnglish-like language, its query-byexample nature is readily picked up by\nthe first-time user.\nThe SPIRE data-base management\nsystem is written in FORTRAN IV and\nMACRO Assembler for interactive execution and has been implemented on a\nDEC VAX-11/780 under VMS 2.0. The\nSPIRE data-base management system\nwas developed in 1980.\nThis program development was managed by Charles F. Fuechsel of Goddard\nSpace Flight Center.

SAP accepts\nas input syntactically-correct FORTRAN\nsource code written for the DEC\nFORTRAN IV-Plus compiler or the IBM\nS/360 FORTRAN IV, Level H, compiler.\nSAP utilizes two external files in its\nanalysis procedure. A keyword file\nallows flexibility in classifying statements\nand in marking a statement as either executable or nonexecutable. A statistical\nweight file allows the user to assign\nweights to all output statistics, thus\nallowing the user flexibility in defining the\nfigure of complexity.\nThe program is written in FORTRAN IV\nfor batch execution and has been implemented on a DEC VAX series computer\nwith a central-memory requirement of\napproximately 94K of 8-bit bytes.

The DOCLIB system consists of two parts to serve the needs of\ntwo types of users: the general user and\nthe librarian. The general-user part\nenables the user to examine the contents of the inventory data base to locate\n\nor validate documents currently maintained in the inventory. The librarian part\nof the DOCLIB system enables the database librarian to add, delete, or modify\ninformation in the data base concerning\nthe document inventory.\nThe DOCLIB system provides the\nuser with an interactive, menu-driven\ndocument inventory capability. Each\ndocument in the inventory is described\nby information that includes the following: reference number, title, author(s),\npublication date, sponsoring organization , the number of pages, subject(s),\ndocument type, and organization document number.\nThe general user can browse through\nthe document inventory data base by\ndisplay ing a part icu lar document\ndescription , displaying document arrivals after a specified date, or by performing a document search. The user\ncan search for documents by author,\nreference number, title fragment, originating organization , and category. Results of a document search may be displayed during the user session and may\nbe routed for hard-copy printing.\nThe DOCLI B system is written in FORTRAN IV-Plus and MACRO Assembler\nfor interactive execution and has been\nimplemented on a DEC PDP-11/70 computer under RSX-11 M with a centralmemory requirement of approximately\nSDK of 16-bit words .

This\nfeature is particularly useful in the area\nof data input because NAMELIST data\n\nare input in the form of the variable symbolic name being set equal to a constant\nvalue, similar to a standard FORTRAN\nstatement. This allows the user to review\ninput data readily and relieves the user\nfrom having to place data in certain columns and formats as required in formatted READ statements.\nNPP software consists of two parts:\nthe NAMELIST preprocessor and the\nNAMELIST li brary rout ines . The\npreprocessor modifies FORTRAN code\ncontaining NAMELIST statements into\nFORTRAN code acceptable to the VAX\nFORTRAN IV compiler. The NAMELIST\nlibrary routines, which must be included\nin task builds containing NAMELIST\npreprocessor code, are the run-time\nrout i nes called by the i nserted\npreprocessor code. The FORTRAN programer should find it easy and efficient to\nincorporate the NAMELIST feature into\nmany appl ications.\nNPP software is written in FORTRAN\nIV and Assembler code for batch execution and has been Implemented on a DEC\nVAX series computer with a centralmemory requirement of approximately\n74K of 8-bit bytes. The NPP software\nsystem was developed in 1978.\nThis program was written by Phillip D.\nMerwarth of Goddard Space Flight\nCenter. For further information ,\nCircle V on the COSMIC Request\nCard.\n\nGSC-12711\n\nResearch and\nDevelopment Mission\nAnalysis System\nProgram forms a basis for\nsolving complex missionanalysiS problems.\nThe Research and Development Mission Analysis System, RADMAS, facilitates the solution of mission-analysis\nproblems in a research and development\nenvironment. RADMAS provides a flexible data-management and control structure from wh ich existing miss ionanalysiS programs can be invoked and\nnew R. & D. models can be developed\nand executed. The system centers on an\nexecutive structure that controls function selection and execution.\nThe main driver for any RADMAS solution is an automatic sequence. This sequence is written in the Mission Analysis\nLanguage (MAL), a FORTRAN-based\nhigh-level language that contains special\nconstructs . RADMAS drivers and\n(continued on next page)\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1983\n\n297\n\nt)\n\nhandlers control solution execution\nthrough automatic sequences that invoke independent tasks to perform the\ndesired function. Problem solution is\ncontrolled interactively through menu\nand parameter displays that enable the\nuser to redirect execution of the task\nbased on run-time information.\nThe built-in RADMAS handlers and\ndrivers include such a wide variety of\nsystem capabilities as intertask communication, data editing and parameter\nmodification, resource and process\nmanagement, automatic system errorinterception and recovery, dynamically\nallocated arrays, and multiple graphics\ndevice capability. The system can incorporate new capabilities without necesSitating major changes to RADMAS itself. The user may also supply other\nfunctions that are required for a particular problem.\nForemost among the built-in RADMAS\nfunctions is the orbit propagation information that produces the vehicle state\nfor other functions. Included in this function are a parametric calculation module,\nwhich supplies various output parameters, and a comprehensive selection of\nstopping conditions on which to terminate propagation . Targeting and optimization procedures are included to aid the\nmission analyst in determining constraints. Error analysis based on a Monte\nCarlo procedure gives the R. & D. user a\ntool for statistical analysis of a mission.\nRADMAS is written in FORTRAN 77\nand Assembler for batch or interactive\nexecution. The system has been \' implemented on a DEC VAX-11/780 operating\nunder VMS with a central-memory requirement of approximately 820K of 8-bit\nbytes . For graphics output the system\nsupports the following devices :\nTektronix, 12S, VT100, CALCOMP, and\nvarious user terminals. RADMAS was\ndeveloped in 1982.\nThis program was written by Wayne A.\nTay/or of Computer Science Corp. for\nGoddard Space Flight Center.

The analyst usually spends considerable time and effort bringing these\npublished algorithms to an integrated\noperational status only to find them less\ngeneral than desired.\nSAMSAN reduces the burden on the\nanalyst by providing a set of algorithms\nthat have been well tested and\ndocumented and that can be readily integrated for solving control-system problems. Algorithm selection for SAM SAN\nhas been biased toward numerical accuracy for large-order systems with\ncomputational speed and portability being considered important but not paramount.\nIn addition to containing relevant\nsubroutines from EISPACK for\neigenanalysis and from UNPACK for the\nsolution of linear systems and related\nproblems, SAM SAN contains the following seven not so generally available\ncapabilities:\n1. Reduction of a real nonsymmetric matrix to block diagonal form via a real similarity transformation matrix, which is well\nconditioned with respect to inversion;\n2. Solution of the generalized eigenvalue\nproblem with balancing and grading;\n3. Computation of all zeros of the determinant of a matrix of polynomials;\n4. Matrix exponentiation and the evalua-\n\ntion of integrals involving the matrix exponential, with option to blockdiagonalize first;\n5. Root locus and frequency response\nfor single variable transfer functions in\nthe S-, Z-, and W-domains;\n6. Several methods of computing zeros\nfor linear systems; and\n7. The ability to generate documentation\n"on demand."\nAll matrix operations in the SAMSAN\nalgorithms assume nonsymmetric\nmatrices with real double-precision\nelements. There is no fixed size limit on\nany matrix in any SAMSAN algorithm ;\nhowever, it is generally agreed by experienced users, and in the numerical\nerror-analysis literature, that computation with non symmetric matrices of\norder greater than about 200 should be\navoided or treated with extreme care.\nSAM SAN attempts to support the needs\nof application-oriented analYSis by providing the following :\na. A methodology with unlimited growth\npotential ;\nb. A methodology to insure that associated documentation is current and\navailable " on demand" ;\nc . A foundation of basic computational\nalgorithms upon which most controlsanalysis procedures are based;\nd. A set of checkout and evaluation programs that demonstrate usage of the\nalgorithms on a series of problems that\nare structured to expose the limits of applicability of each algorithm; and\ne. Capabilities that support both a priori\nand a posteriori error analysis for the\ncomputational algorithms provided.\nThe SAMSAN algorithms are coded in\nFORTRAN IV for batch or interactive ex\xc2\xb7\necution and have been implemented on\na DEC VAX-11/780 computer under VMS\n2.0. An effort was made to assure that\nthe FORTRAN source code was portable, and thus SAMSAN may be adaptable to other machine environments.\nThe SAMSAN package was developed in\n1982.\nThis program was written by Harold\nP. Frisch of Goddard Space Flight\nCenter.
