Since the impedance of the\nmagnetic core is a function of its direction of saturation, (i.e., information state), the current source must\npresent a high impedance to the cores. This is usually\naccomplished by placing a high resistance in series\nwith the core. This however, results in extensive power\nloss. In addition, the large number of semiconductor\nswitches required decreases the reliability of the current source.\nThe solution:\nA pulse current source which uses low loss, high Q,\nLC circuits to provide the necessary high impedance.\nSquare-loop reactors are used to replace the semiconductor switches.\nHow it's done:\nEach of the identical stages of the pulse current\nsource serves as a high-impedance current source for\nthe next stage. A current pulse is generated in succeeding stages when switch S 0 is closed. Energy remaining at the final stage is returned to the initial\nenergy storage capacitor, Co. Since the only energy\ndissipated in the circuit is in the switching resistance\nof the magnetic cores, the system is highly efficient.\n\nThis document was prepared under the sponsorship of the National \t\nAeronautics and Space Administration.

When the\nsquare-loop reactor is in one saturated state it presents a high impedance to the charging current. The\nleakage current through the square-loop reactor will\nstart to change its direction of saturation. The reactor\nswitches into opposite saturation just as the capacitor\nbecomes fully charged. In this state, the reactor presents a low impedance to the charge onthe capacitor,\nwhich allows the capacitor to discharge, thereby developing a current pulse in the magnetic core. A small\namount of current also flows back into the preceding\nstage, resetting that reactor to its original state. This\nprocess will be repeated through all of the stages\nuntil the discharge of the last capacitor (Ca) recharges\nCo. Due to the losses in the magnetic cores, however,\nCo is not fully charged, and because of diode Di,\nthe last reactor (Pn) has not been reset. Co can be\nrecharged by closing S, and Pn can be reset by placing\na separate reset winding on the reactor which could be\nactivated by the discharge of Co.\nNotes:\nI. The switches shown can be replaced by electromechanical (relays) or electronic (transistors) elements.\t\n(continued overleaf)\n\nGovernment assumes any liability resulting from the use of the\ninformation contained in this document, or warrants that such use\nwill be free from privately owned rights.\n\nThis invention should be of interest to manufacturers of computer memory equipment.\nInquiries concerning this invention may be directed to:\nTechnology Utilization Officer\nLangley Research Center\nLangley Station\nHampton, Virginia 23365\nReference: B6740603\n\nBrief 67-10603\t\n\nPatent status:\nTitle to this invention has been waived under the\nprovisions of the National Aeronautics and Space\nAct 142 U.S.C. 2457 (f)j to the Stanford Research\nInstitute, Menlo Park, California 94025.\nSource: Stanford Research Institute\r\nunder contract to\r\nLangley Research Center\n(LaRC-68)\n\nCategory 01\n\n"
