In\n1988, a similar adventure was launched, though in this\ncase carbon-fiber composites, gears, and driveshafts featured instead of wax and feathers.\nA year earlier, a group of students, alumni, and professors from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n(MIT) gathered at Dryden Flight Research Center to\nbegin a series of test flights for what they hoped would be\na record-setting effort. Inspired by the Greek myth, the\nteam built and tested three lightweight, human-powered\naircraft designed to reenact Daedalus\xe2\x80\x99 (according to the\ntale) 115-kilometer flight. After numerous test flights of\n\nThe Daedalus 88 aircraft is seen here on its last flight at Dryden\nFlight Research Center in 1988. The aircraft set records for\nhuman-powered flight that still hold today.\n\n72\t\n\nPublic Safety \t\n\nthe three aircraft (and one crash), the 69-pound Daedalus\n88 launched from Crete in April 1988. Powered only by\nthe pedaling of the pilot, a Greek champion cyclist, the\naircraft flew nearly 4 hours and 199 kilometers before\nwinds drove it into the sea just off the coast of the island\nof Santorini. (If this calls to mind the demise of Daedalus\xe2\x80\x99\nson Icarus, do not worry; the pilot swam to shore.)\nSetting distance and duration records for humanpowered flight that are still unmatched today, the\nDaedalus project provided NASA and the MIT team the\nopportunity to explore new technologies for lightweight\naircraft and high-altitude, long-duration flight. Also from\nthis effort came the kernel of a company that\xe2\x80\x94with the\nhelp of NASA partnerships\xe2\x80\x94is producing some of the\nworld\xe2\x80\x99s most advanced aviation technologies.\n\nPartnership\nIn 1989, John Langford founded Aurora Flight\nSciences Corporation in a small office in Alexandria,\nVirginia. Langford had managed the Daedalus project\nand saw great potential in applying the technologies\ndeveloped for that effort to the innovation of highaltitude unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for global\nclimate change research. Almost immediately, Aurora\nestablished a pattern of partnership with NASA that\ncontinues today.\n\xe2\x80\x9cNASA has been a critical supporter of Aurora from\nday one,\xe2\x80\x9d says Langford. The company has engaged in\nnumerous Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)\nand Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR)\nprojects with the Agency, beginning with its initial Ames\nResearch Center SBIR, for the development of a fuel cellbased high-altitude propulsion system, up until its most\nrecent contract in 2009 to create aspirated compressors\nfor a high-altitude, long-endurance (HALE) concept\nengine for Glenn Research Center. These partnerships\nhave provided opportunities for Aurora on multiple\nfronts, Langford says.\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThere is a technology development function, a personnel development function, and also a collaboration\nfunction through SBIRs and STTRs,\xe2\x80\x9d he explains. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\nhave bright new talent, and these programs provide a\ngreat way for people to explore new ideas.\xe2\x80\x9d\nAurora, now headquartered in Manassas, Virginia,\nhas also worked with NASA on several unique initiatives.\nThe company developed the Perseus A, Perseus B, and\nTheseus test bed UAVs for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Environmental\nResearch Aircraft and Sensor Technology (ERAST)\nprogram. Designed to encourage the advancement of costeffective UAVs for HALE science missions, ERAST was\ninstrumental in the creation of new UAV technologies like\nthe Predator B, known as the Altair in its NASA science\nmission version and as the MQ-9 Reaper for the military.\nAurora also designed and created a series of UAVs for\npotential long-range science missions on Mars.\nIn addition, a Space Act Agreement with Goddard\nSpace Flight Center and West Virginia University was significant to Aurora\xe2\x80\x99s commercial activities today. Through\nthe partnership, Aurora developed low-cost composite\nmaterials manufacturing capabilities and opened a\nmanufacturing facility in West Virginia. These outcomes\nenabled Aurora to provide cost-efficient airframe parts for\nthe Teledyne Ryan (now Northrop Grumman) Global\nHawk UAV, designed for the U.S. Air Force.\n\nProduct Outcome\nAurora now has 350 employees and has facilities in\nMississippi and Massachusetts, in addition to its West\nVirginia and Virginia operations. The company employs\n160 people in its NASA-enabled West Virginia plant, and\nabout one-third of Aurora\xe2\x80\x99s work force is dedicated to\nthe company\xe2\x80\x99s Global Hawk efforts. Aurora now supplies\nall the composite structures for Global Hawk, save for\nthe wings.\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis is an example of economic development done\nright,\xe2\x80\x9d Langford says. \xe2\x80\x9cYou want to build up the economy\nSpinoff 2010\n\nThrough a Space Act\nAgreement, Aurora Flight\nSciences Corporation developed\nmanufacturing techniques that\nenable the company to provide\nmuch of the composite airframe\nfor the Global Hawk UAV (left).\nThese capabilities allowed\nAurora to open a manufacturing\nfacility in West Virginia that now\nemploys 160 workers. The\ncompany also develops its own\ncutting-edge UAV designs, such\nas the GoldenEye 80 ductedfan aircraft (right) for military\nsurveillance applications.\n\nacross the country, and this was a move that NASA participated in that has been very successful.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe partnership has also allowed Aurora to contribute to the use of UAVs for scientific endeavors; NASA\xe2\x80\x99s\ntwo Global Hawk aircraft began long-duration science\nmissions over the Pacific Ocean in 2010 as part of the\nAgency\xe2\x80\x99s Global Hawk Pacific Mission.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are very proud of the fact that parts of those\nplanes were built in our West Virginia facility,\xe2\x80\x9d Langford\nsays.\nAurora\xe2\x80\x99s expertise in advanced aviation development\xe2\x80\x94\ncultivated in part through its NASA work\xe2\x80\x94has led to\nthe creation of unique robotic aircraft that are providing\nentirely new takes on UAV design and function. Aurora\xe2\x80\x99s\nGoldenEye and Excalibur aircraft are both vertical\ntakeoff and landing vehicles with science-fiction looks.\nThe GoldenEye 50 and the larger GoldenEye 80 are\nducted-fan aircraft designed to provide highly portable\nsurveillance for military applications. Excalibur is an\narmed tactical UAV that takes off on one side and then\nrolls over for mission mode, protecting its sensors from\nany dust kicked up by its propulsion system.\nSpinoff 2010\t\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cA lot of aircraft missions are not involved with carrying people, and when you take the people out of the\nequation, it completely changes the design space,\xe2\x80\x9d explains\nLangford. \xe2\x80\x9cGoldenEye and Excalibur are examples of\ndesigns that have no analog in manned aircraft.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe popularity of UAVs has risen dramatically in\nrecent years, Langford says. \xe2\x80\x9cTen years ago, all the UAVs\nin the world flew a few thousand flight hours per year,\ntotal. This last year, UAVs flew between 500,000 and a\nmillion flight hours.\xe2\x80\x9d Such growth is remarkable, he says,\nbut still hardly compares to\nthe 100 million manned flight\n\xe2\x80\x9cUnderstanding hours flown each year worldwide. And science missions are\nand protecting\nstill a vast minority of UAV\nour planet is a\napplications, though Langford\nhuge reason why predicts that will change with\ntaxpayers should NASA\xe2\x80\x99s help.\n\xe2\x80\x9cWe are extremely excited\nbe enthusiastic\nabout the renewed emphasis on\nabout NASA.\xe2\x80\x9d\naeronautics and global change\nresearch. It is something only\n\nNASA can do, and it fits perfectly with NASA\xe2\x80\x99s heritage,\nmission, and capabilities. Understanding and protecting our planet is a huge reason why taxpayers should be\nenthusiastic about NASA.\xe2\x80\x9d\nIn the meantime, Aurora is continuing work on a\nnumber of UAV projects, including its Orion HALL\n(high-altitude, long-loiter) aircraft, which can fly for\n5 days nonstop, and the Centaur optionally piloted\nairplane. And while the original Daedalus aircraft that\ninspired Aurora\xe2\x80\x99s founding set records with its nearly\n4-hour flight, the company is also working on a project\nthat may one day perform flights of positively mythical\nproportions: The solar-powered Odysseus aircraft may\none day be capable of flying for up to 5 years at a time. \xe2\x9d\x96\nPerseus\xe2\x84\xa2, Theseus\xe2\x84\xa2, GoldenEye\xe2\x84\xa2, Excalibur\xe2\x84\xa2, and Orion\nHALL\xe2\x84\xa2 are trademarks of Aurora Flight Sciences Corporation.\n\nPublic Safety \t 73\n\n'
