The mass of BCA in the Arctic troposphere is one percent of the total aerosol, reduced to one part in 104 in the stratosphere. A Mie algorithm permits the calculation of the optical properties of the various aerosol components, and an algorithm developed by Ackerman and Toon and modified to serve our needs lets us calculate the optical effects of the black carbon aerosol that is mixed internally with the sulfuric acid aerosol. It follows that the effect of internally-mixed BCA on the aerosol scattering and absorption properties depends on its location within the droplet. BCA concentrated near the droplet surface has a greater effect on absorption of solar radiation than does the same amount of BCA located near its center. Single scatter albedos of the combined system are omega(sub 0)=1.0 in the post-Pinatubo Arctic stratosphere, and as low as 0.94 in the troposphere. The aerosol has the potential to regionally warm the Arctic earth-atmosphere system, because of the high surface albedo of the snow-covered Arctic.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"country": "Sweden", "submissionId": 20020008209, "endDate": "1994-11-10T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "World Climate Research Programme Conference", "location": "Goeteborg", "id": "760950defd544fa289783349de23d260", "startDate": "1994-11-07T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20020008209, "id": "75d075cd975343e9a6274b2a12f9d808", "publicationDate": "1994-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
