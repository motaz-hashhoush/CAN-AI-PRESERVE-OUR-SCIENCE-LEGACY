The advantages of run-time control optimization and arm reconfiguration are becoming increasingly attractive as the complexity and criticality of robotic systems continues to progress. A generalized control law for a spatial arm with 7 or more degrees of freedom (DOF) based on Whitney's resolved rate formulation is given. Results from a simulation implementation utilizing this control law are presented. Furthermore, results from a two arm simulation are presented to demonstrate the coordinated control of multiple arms using this formulation.", "title": "Kinematically redundant arm formulations for coordinated multiple arm implementations", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T15:25:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19900016235, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Bailey, Robert W."}, "organization": {"name": "LinCom Corp.", "location": "Houston, TX., United States"}}, "id": "8def407690334880a9918e930a97ea1e"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19900016235, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Quiocho, Leslie J."}, "organization": {"name": "LinCom Corp.", "location": "Houston, TX., United States"}}, "id": "7ad4535a850146cc82ddc18b7fe747ba"}, {"sequence": 2, "submissionId": 19900016235, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Cleghorn, Timothy F."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Lyndon B.
