This squaring approach serves to produce the absolute value of the arriving signal as opposed to the perfect square law action which is required in order to render acquisition and tracking performance equivalent to that of a Costas loop. The Ku-Band orbiter signal design for the forward link is assessed. Acquisition time results and acquisition and tracking thresholds are summarized. A tradeoff study which pertains to bit synchronization techniques for the high rate Ku-Band channel is included and an optimum selection is made based upon the appropriate design constraints.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19770016348, "id": "c48587cfc58343c2a6c75127a2878038", "publicationDate": "1977-03-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19770016348.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19770016348/downloads/19770016348.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19770016348/downloads/19770016348.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19770016348/downloads/19770016348.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
