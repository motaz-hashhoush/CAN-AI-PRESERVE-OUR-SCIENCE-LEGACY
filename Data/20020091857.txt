That\'s why Chesebrough\'s\nelectric bill used to run as high as $8\nmillion a year. It will be a great deal\nlower this year, thanks to a company\ndeveloped\ndevice that makes electric\nmotors "smart" enough to regulate\ntheir own output\nand dramatically\nreduce the energy they use.\nThe device is an inexpensive,\ncomputerized\nmotor controller\nthat\ncuts power wastage by sensing a\nmotor\'s load and feeding the motor\nonly the minimum\nvoltage it needs\nC\n\nthat cuts\n\nenergy consumption\nhighlights a\nselection of spinoffs for consumer,\nhome and agricultural\nuse\n\nto do its job. Chesebrough\nhas\ndeveloped\none version for retrofitting\nexisting motors, another for new\nsingle-phase\nsmall general purpose\nindustrial motors, and a third for\ncontrolling\nlarge three-phase\nmotors\nin industrial\nuse.\nIn laboratory\ntests, single-phase\nmotors equipped\nwith the controller\nhave demonstrated\nenergy savings\nas high as 90 percent. Realistically,\nChesebrough\nexpects savings in an\nactual plant environment\nto range\nfrom 10 to 50 percent, depending\non the type of motor and how it\nis used. Even the lower figure\nrepresents\na tremendous\nsaving for\nindustrial\nfirms that operate as\nmany or more motors than does\nChesebrough.\nThe company\nestimates that reduced electric bills\n\nwill pay back the cost of retrofitting\nthe motors in Chesebrough\nplants in\nonly two years.\nWhat makes the Chesebrough\ncontroller\ndevelopment\nparticularly\ninteresting\nis the fact that the\ncompany is not an electric-motor\nmanufacturer\nnor a high technology\nenterprise.\nChesebrough-Pond\'s\nmanufactures\nand markets consumer\nproducts;\nperhaps best known for\nPond\'s skin cream, the company\nproduces\na widely diversified line\nranging from Q-tips to Cutex,\nchildren\'s clothing to home\npermanents,\nperfume to spaghetti\nsauce. Chesebrough\nnever intended\nto get into the controller\nbusiness; it\nwas simply looking for a way to trim\nits substantial\nelectric bill and, unable\nto find a commercially-available\nAt left is a conveyor\nline at the\nClinton,\nConnecticut\nplant of\nChesebrough-Pond\'s\nInc.,\nwhere the widely diversified\ncompany\nmanufactures\nsuch\nproducts\nas vaseline,\nhair spray\nand permanent\nlotions.\nThe\nred box in the center photo is\na computerized\nsingle-phase\nmotor controller,\nbased on\nNASA\ntechnology,\nthat\ndramatically\nreduces the\namount\nof energy required\nto\nrun the conveyor line. At right\nis a three-phase\nunit, used\nto control\nlarger industrial\nmotors,\nin the boiler room\nof the Clinton\nplant.\n\n84\n\ncontroller suited to its special needs,\nit proceeded to invent one.\nThe controller traces its origin to\nwork in the mid-seventies at Marshall\nSpace Flight Center (MSFC)\nwhichJas\npart of its energy\nconservation research in support of\nthe Department of Energy--was\nseeking a means of curbing power\nwastage caused by the fact that\nalternating current motors operate at\na fixed vokage. The fixed voltage is\nwhat motors need to handle the\nheaviest loads they are designed to\ncarry, but a motor usually does not\noperate at full load conditions; even\nwhen it is idling, it is still getting\nfull-load vokage and, with\nmukimillions of electric motors in\nthe U.S., the cumulative wastage is\nof enormous order.\nMSFC engineer Frank Nola\ndeveloped a device--called the Power\nFactor Controller (PFC)--that\nmatches vokage with the motor\'s\nneed. Plugged into a motor, it\ncontinuously determines load by\nsensing shifts in the relationship\nbetween vokage and current flow.\nWhen the controller senses a light\nload, it cuts the vokage to the\nminimum needed, thus effecting\nlarge-scale savings.\nIn 1977, Chesebrough organized\na Corporate Advanced Technology\nGroup at Clinton, Connecticut\nto devise ways of improving\n\nproductivity and cutting\nmanufacturing costs. As its major\nproject, the group tackled energy\nreduction and evaluated a number\nof energy control devices, none of\nwhich met company requirements.\nIn 1979, Chesebrough acquired a\nlicense for the NASA Power Factor\nController technology. The PFC,\nwhile effective in many applications,\nwas not the answer to Chcsebrough\'s\nparticular needs, principally because\nit required many user adjustments\nto meet the many variable factors\nassociated with operating electric\nmotors in a manufacturing plant.\nChesebrough, therefore, used the\nNASA technology as a departure\npoint for development of a\n"user friendly" smart system--a\ncomputerized motor controller that\nwould monitor thc variables, evaluate\ntheir impacts, and calculate the\nappropriate commands that would\nenable the motor to operate at\nmaximum efficiency regardless of the\nmotor\'s application or operating\nconditions. The key element of the\ncontroller that emerged from the\nChcsebrough development program\nis a microprocessor that does the\ncalculations and sends the command\nsignals. The system also employs\nsolid state components to perform\nmotor functions traditionally handled\nby mechanical parts.\nRay Davis, director of the\ncompany\'s Corporate Advanced\nTechnology Group, sums up the\ndevelopment this way:\n"The Chesebrough controller\nmakes it possible for motors to\nhave their own built-in control\nintelligence. Instead of being dumb\nmachines, they can now be smart.\nSmart motors will maximize their\nefficiency and automatically protect\nthemselves from environmental or\nuser abuse. Smart motors can take\ndata and send commands to solid\nstate sensors and controls at speeds,\nand with a degree of reliability and\naccuracy, not possible with\nmechanical devices. And smart\nmotors can monitor their own\nperformance and warn of impending\nfailure before it becomes a cause of\ncritical system shutdown."\nIn 1980, Chesebrough completed\nthe design of its single-phase\ncontroller and built 50 units for field\ntrials. Twenty-five of them were\ninstalled at the company\'s Hospital\nProducts Division, Watertown, New\nYork; they have operated\n\ncontinuously and successfully ever\nsince, providing annual energy\nsavings of 20-30 percent. The\ncompany also built and similarly\nfield tested several models of the\nthree-phase controller. In 1982,\nChesebrough was granted a patent\nfor the invention.\nThe company decided to license\nthe technology, something it rarely\ndoes, so that American home and\nindustrial users could benefit from\na development that Chcsebrough\nchairman Ralph E. Ward says is "too\ngood and too important to keep to\nourselves." The company has signed\nan agreement with National\nSemiconductor Corporation for\nmanufacture and marketing of the\nsingle-phase controller; Chesebrough\nwill similarly license production of\nthe three-phase unit. The market\npotential for the single-phase system\nalone is estimated at $100 million a\nyear by the late 1980s.\n\n85\n\n'
