The mean averaging interval for the relative motion data was reduced to less than 3 My. A detailed comparison of RM2 with angular velocity vectors which best fit the data along individual plate boundaries indicates that RM2 performs close to optimally in most regions, with several notable exceptions. On the other hand, a previous estimate (RM1) failed to satisfy an extensive set of new data collected in the South Atlantic Ocean. It is shown that RM1 incorrectly predicts the plate kinematics in the South Atlantic because the presently available data are inconsistent with the plate geometry assumed in deriving RM1. It is demonstrated that this inconsistency can be remedied by postulating the existence of internal deformation with the Indian plate, although alternate explanations are possible.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19780016766, "id": "2bd2bf204ebb44e6bb0b9037601f9a4d", "publicationDate": "1977-11-10T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19780016766.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19780016766/downloads/19780016766.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19780016766/downloads/19780016766.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19780016766/downloads/19780016766.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
