SCCS is made up of complex software that will control and monitor the Space Launch System rocket and Orion spacecraft. Once it is fully developed, SCCS will be a large improvement to previous software since it takes advantage of modern computers and information making it faster and more reliable than the software used previously on the Shuttle program. The software will be tailored to the specific needs of the Space Launch System (SLS) and Orion spacecraft. These three projects will be brought together for the launch of Exploration Mission-1.", "title": "Spaceport Command and Control System: Network Engineering", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2018-09-26T15:58:26.1930000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20180005642, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Mackh, Katherine"}, "organization": {"name": "Bradley Univ.", "location": "Peoria, IL, United States"}}, "id": "b1fcb73285764f73ba9c2115e7d819ce"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 20180005642, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Villorin, Allan"}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Kennedy Space Center", "location": "Cocoa Beach, FL, United States"}}, "id": "b0259d02c9cc4d6b9d57b22f77d19ae1"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "id": 20180005642, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20180005642, "id": "c2acb0336ca141ae90ffe3aff3426856", "publicationDate": "2018-07-15T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20180005642.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20180005642/downloads/20180005642.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20180005642/downloads/20180005642.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20180005642/downloads/20180005642.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
