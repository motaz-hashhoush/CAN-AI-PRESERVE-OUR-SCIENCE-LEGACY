Also presented\nare, those vendor checkout and receiving inspection ijrocedures vital to assurance of\nquality of parts and materials. The documntation in this plan includes schematic\ndrawings, reports, and procedures: these a r e essential elements of the checkout program. This plan is oriented to the checkout operations necessary before assembly,\nduring assembly, after assembly, before captive test firing, and after captive test firing; this plan is predicated on broad planning for integration of all elements of the\n\nf \'1 \'"7,\nLlJ\n\ncl-iockout program and scheduling of events. Included in t h i s plan are those guides associated with checkout operations performed on all stages of a launch vehicle o r on any\ncomponent part intended for installation on any stage.\nThe scope of this plan is in seven parts; each part denotes a major milestone. Each\nmilestone is itemized in Figure 1-1. Three additional milestones (beyond the scope of\n\n.\'r-- I.\n\nthis plan) are listed to indicate that the checkout performed at the launch site will influence the checkout procedures, checkout equipment, data processing procedures, data\nacquisitiofi eqLi?mer.t, m softtsrzre develqxxect for othcr phzscs of chackoat.

Also, they include the general personnel requirements, and\na recognition for the need of checkout equipment, data acquisition equipment, and\n\ntest facilities.\n\n-\n\nUnder analysis, the stage is divided into various systems and subsystems which perform separate, as weii as inlegral, functions. Tnen, tests are devisea to measure\n\n-\n\nthe functions which must be verified in order to determine that the system satisfies\n\nis design objectives, Following the buildingblock concept through the individual subt\nsystem and system test requirements, the over-all systems tests are devised. These\ntests are devised in consideration of mission requirements and systems synthesis.\nThen, the objectives, test requirements, parameters, etc., of these subsystem and\nsystem tests are established in logical sequence, These are described in Section2.11.\nAfter these detailed test requirements have been established, the test equipment and\nfacilities can be described. Requirements for test equipment and facilities will be\nfound in Sections 2.8 and 2.9, respectively.\n\ni\n\nt!\n\nAdequate communication of information between various organizational components\nhas been a major problem in both industry and government, The section on documen-\n\ni\n\ntation, Section 2.10, attempts to reduce this problem by discussing the reports and\nother data which will be required by the procuring activity.\n\n2-1\n\n.\n.-\n\n~\n\n-. ..- .\n\n. -- -\n\nSection 2 . 4 , Program Planning and Scheduling, describes the various charts and\nschedules that should be included in a test program, as well as the time required to\ncomplete various milestones. The section contains a functional flow diagram and a\nbar graph of the various checkouts which are described in Section 2.11.\nSection 2.0 of the plan is concluded with a description o the simulated flight test.\nf\nSuccessful attainment of the intent of the objectives of all tests preliminary to the\nsimulated flight test should result in this test being performed without any delay or\ndeviations. Successful completion of this test shall be a prerequisite to the delivery\nof the stage to the proouring activity.\n\nJ\n\n2-2\n\n.\n\n2.2\n\n.SCOPE\n\nThis section is applicable to all checkout performed on an assembled stage from \xe2\x80\x99the\ncompletion of stage analysis until aornpletion of the post-CTF checkout, with the\nexception of the captive test firing. It includes the checkouts shown in Figure 3-2,\nd\n\nB\nn\n\n!;\n\nt\n:\n\n* .\nI\n\n-.\n\nq\nt\n\nI\n\n2-3\n\n.\n.r._\n\n.\n\n_ .\n\n/i\ni\n\n2.3\n\n.\n\nGENERAL GUIDELINES\n\nThe general guidelines in this section which form the MSFC checkout philosophy have\nbeen implemented in other checkout programs and differ here only in their application.\nThey a r e described as they apply to an integrated checkout complex.\n\n..\nI\n\n!\n\nThe checkout flow should follow a logical, well planned sequence that permits adequate\ntesting of each component and/or system with a minimum of duplication, and with the\nmost efficient use of manpower, equipment, and facilities. Figure 2-1 is an example\n\n- -_\n\nof an acceptable checkout plan. Figures 2-2 and 2-3 provide illustrations of checkout\n,\n\n_-\n\nflow diagrams.\nThe building-block principle of testing shall be utilized. This means that components\nare tested individually before they a r e required to perform in subsystems, and subsystems a r e tested individually before they are required to perform in systems. In\nthis manner, problems encountered in an item under test are detected and located\nwith a minimum o effect on units which interface with it in the next higher assembly,\nf\nThis reduces the operating time on the units, increases efficiency, and forms the\nbasis for a schedule which can be more easily met.\nThe stage checkout operation will be integrated to utilize the checkout time more\nefficiently and facilities more effectively, All testing will be accomplished in a logical\nsequence and the test results recorded in a format meaningful to future testing.\nTesting should be planned to accommodate failures and fault isolation routines without\n\n,\n\ninterrupting all checkout operations.\nThe checkout operation should have its own integrity. It should be accomplished in a\nseparate checkout area in which working conditions, as well as access to the area, are\nstrictly controlled. No assembly work should be performed on the item which is under\ntest except rework which is scheduled on a non-interference basis. Substitution will\nbe used as sparingly as possible and primarily for reasons of safety. No simulated\nflight hardware will be used during checkout except as required for safety reasons.\nUnnecessary interruptions of the test proceedings should be avoided.\nThe checkout system should be developed from concepts based on the most versatile\nselection of manual and automatic systems to arrive at the optimum balance between\nman and machine. The end result of automation should be equal to o r better than the\nend result\n\n2-4\n\n.\n\nof alternate methods.\n\n.\n\n3\n\n.i\n\nb J\n\nn\n\n!\n\n0\n\n5\n\ni\n\n7\n\nJ\n\ni\n\n!\n\nJ\n\n-\n\n.- 2-5-----\n\nI\n\nI\n\n6 "\n\nE\n\n1\n\\\n\n2-6\n\nI\n\ni\n\n.\n\n2-7\n\nThe organization responsible for stage checkout should have trained, highly skilled\npersonnel who thoroughly understand the test specimen and should perform independ-\'\n\nently of the design and manufacturing elements. They should establish test criteria\nderived from design specifications and design objectives and should be responsible\nfor accepting the checkout results.\nA test conductor engineer with a technical understanding of the test equipment, the\n\nitem under test, and the test procedures shall be assigned the responsibility for all\nl\ntesting. He must be a participant in the checkout and be available at a l times. He\nshall control access of personnel to the test area, which is normally limited to the\ntest conductor and his required assistants, The test conductor should be cognizant\nof management policies and should be responsible for the checkout schedule. Check-\n\nout engineers who specialize in the various subsystems should be available to assist\nthe test conductor at all times.\nt\n\nThe status and anticipated progress of the test procedures should be reported at\nregular intervals, by the test conductor, to all testing personnel.\n\n3\n\ni\n\nNo acceptance test shall be performed except by use of procedures previously approved\nand signed by the procuring activity.\nAn organized data processing plan .shall be developed and implemented. This plan\n\nshould insure that all required data is processed and delivered to cognizant organizations.\n\n\'\n\nA complete and accurate log of all the significant events which occur during the testing\n- - -should be prepared each day and signed by the test conductor. It should contain a\n\nsummary of the events of the day, such as problems, solutions, progress, etc.\nTest equipment and hardware under test should incorporate fail-safe provisions so\nthat it returns to a safe condition in the event of power failure o r other emergency.\nStage checkout must demonstrate compatibility of all systems.\n\nNo subsystem vendor\n\ncheckout data will be accepted in lieu o stage acceptance test results except for those\nf\ntests which may be impractical to perform for safety reasofis and/or because\n\n3\n\nexpendable items.\n\\\n\n2-8\n\n,\n\no\nf\n\\\n\n1\n\nReplacement o r rework of parts shall require that appropriate tests be re-run in order\nto verify that the new part is compatible with and meets the requirements of the system.\nA comprehensive checkout program will determine that no problems result from inter-\n\naction of systems o r subsystems, in addition to verifying the satisfactory operation of\n\n*\n\nthe individual system or subsystem.\n\nf\nStandardization o equipment, procedures, and techniques should be accomplished\nwhere it is practical and where it does not compromise objectives,\n\n..\n.-\n\n.\n\n2-9\n\n.\n\nPROGRAM PLANNING AND SCHEDULING\n\n2.4\n\n2.4.1\n\nIntroduction\n\nTo implement the requirements of a test plan, major milestonee should be\nestablished and scheduled. These major milestones will facilitate the estab-\n\nlishment of the broad objectives and requirements. Detailed planning and\nscheduling will be conducted concurrently with the establishment o requiref\nments and specifications. Charts and schedules will be prepared, such as the\nsummary type charts shown in this section. Detailed "shread outs" (or break-\n\nf\ndowns) o these charts in real time should also be made; however, it is not\npractical to include examples of these in this document.\n2.4.2\n\nMajor Checkout Milestones\n\nf\nFigure 2-1 shows the major checkout milestones which are within the scope o\nthis plan.\n2.4.3\n\n3\n\nManufacturing Checkout Flow\n\nFigure 2-2 shows the events that make up the manufacturing checkout bl ck\nshown on Figure 2-1. It presents an example of the sequence of events,\ntogether with the time scheduled to accomplish these operations. Detailed\nexamination and planning is required to determine the proper sequence and\nto determine which operations can parallel each other.\n2.4.4\n\nManufacturing Checkout Bar Chart\n\nThe bar chart shown in Figure 2-3 is used to illustrate parallel anL series\ntest operations as well as the planned time to perform the operations. This\ntype of chart is more readily oriented to the calendar and enables the planner\nto visualize the scheduling problems.\n2.4.5\n\nCheckout Documentation Schedule\n\nFigure 2-4 shows the time and event relationship beween the various procedures, specifications, and other documents which must be time-phased into\nf\nthe hardware and test equipment delivery schedule. The time sequence o\nevents enables the planner to detect critical areas so that proper emphasis can\n\\\n\nI\n\n2-10\n\nbe applied to insure that the end-item delivery dates a r e met,\n\n.\n\nt\n\n2-11\n\n*\n\nI\n\n-\n\n2.5\n\nGENERAL TEST OBJECTIVES\n\nThe test objective defines the purpose for which a test is performed. Any test procedure or test operation must assure that the test objective has been accomplished.\n!\n\nThe readout of the correct parameter, in itself, does not necessarily constitute\ncompliance with the test objectives. The intent of the objective must also be accomplished. This requires that the person conducting the test understands the item under\ntest and the test equipment thoroughly.\nThe objective of each test which is to be performed should be clearly stated in the\nover-all test plan and in each test procedure. Test objectives are formulated from\nanalyses of the design objectives, design intent, and past experience with similar\nsystems. The test conductor is responsible to insure not only that each test is performed, but also that the test objectives are accomplished.\nThe objectives of assembled stage checkout are to demonstrate the operational suit-\n\nability of the stage, Other objectives of this oheckout are aB follows1\n\nd.\n\nTo demonstrate the adequacy of the design.\nTo verify that the hardware fulfills quality and design requirements.\nTo gain confidence that the hardware will satisfy mission requirements by\nfurnishing data for reliability assessment.\nTo discover hardware defects and discrepancies so that timely corrective\n\ne.\n\naction can be initiated.\nTo reduce the cost of developing an operational stage by eliminating many\n\na.\nb.\nc.\n\nproblems prior to the flight test and thereby improving the probability o\nf\nsuccess of the flight test.\nThe detailed test objectives that must be satisfied for each checkout which is performed under this plan are outlined in Section 2.11 with their associated checkout.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98\n\n3\xe2\x80\x98\n2-12\n\nTEST REQUIREMENTS\n\n2.6\n\nTest requirements are generated in an attempt t o insure that the test objectives are\naccomplished in a manner which is safe, efficient, and adequately documented, For\nexample, by speeifying the parameters whieh have to be reeerded end the ~ ~ ~ i f i ~ a tions of the data acquisition system which is used, the test engineer is more certain\nthat he will obtain the data that he needs to evaluate his system. Test requirements\nmay be prepared for the purpose of describing all known equipment, data, personnel,\nconditions, and any other resources that must be applied in order to accomplish the\nintent of the objectives. Failure to describe the requirements adequately could result\n\n,\n,\n\nin testing that doe&not accomplish the objectives. This in turn would lead to a r e - m\nof the test, The re-run can be avoided by studying the objectives and applying the\nequipment and facrility, personnel, and other resources in an efficient manner by\nlisting the requirements for this item in advance of the test.\n\n.\n\ni\n\nSome of the requirements generally considered are listed below:\na. List of parameters which should be measured to determine if the objectives\nhave been accomplished:\no\n\nAccuracy of measurements.\n\no\n\nType of measurements.\n\no\n\nRange o measurements.\nf\n\no\n\nFrequency response of measurements.\n\nbo Number s test points or measurements to be made*\nf\nc.

AC and dc electrical power.\nb. Pneumatic and hydraulic power.\n\nc.\n\nControl of stage and ground electrical networks and pneumatic\nsystems.\n\nd.\ne.\nf.\ng.\n\nElectrical and mechanical test stimuli,\nResponse monitoring and measuring,\nTest data recording,\nTest data evaluation and fault isolation.\n\nThe details of the equipment chosen to supply the above items and functions can\n\nvary considerably. There is one general question, however, which must be\nresolved before these details can be considered: that is whether to implement\nstage checkout manually or automatically. One fact, above all, makes the use\nof a computer for Saturn stage checkout almost mandatory: that is the very large\nnumber of test points associated with a stage, and the speed in which these test\npoints are presented to the checkout equipment. The ability of a computer to\naccept this large quantity of rapidly presented data, compare it to predetermined\ntolerances, and print out results in a minimum of time with great accuracy\nmakes it a powerful checkout tool.\n!\n\nThe requirement for computer-controlled checkout does not require that every\ntest operation be performed automatically. There are many test operations\nwhere automation is not technically or economically feasible. Many mechanical\nfunctions a r e in this category. Each test operation must be assessed on its own\nmerits as to whether or not it should be automated. The main criteria are the\ntechnical and economical feasibility and the effect on the reliability of the system. No test operation should be automated if it is determined that doing so\nreduc-es system reliability.\n\n2-27\n\nt\n\n2.8.2\n\nGeneral Requirement\n\nA s stated previously, the details of the equipment chosen t o perform the ground\n.\n\nsupport functions may vary considerably between different organizations for\n\n.\n\nmany reasons. Not the least of these reasons is experience. The experience\ngained by the procuring activity through many years of testing large boosters\ngives rise to the following general requirements for ground support equipment:\n\na.\n\nThe test complex shall be integrated to the extent that the duplication of functions and equipment is minimized. An example of this\noccurs when different stations require the same stage function o r\n\n-\n\n-\n\ncontrol. That function or control shall be provided in the one\nstation that is the most logical. This requirement shall not\neliminate redundancy when this redundancy is required to meet\nb,\n\nreliability goals.\nAll test operations shall be performed by o r under the cognizance\nof the central computer complex. This means that test operations\nwill be monitored by the computer, and whenever practical, the\ntest results will be inserted in the computer memory even when it\nis decided to perform a test operation manually. This requirement\ntakes maximum advantage of the computer as a data storage facility\n\nC.\n\nand minimizes the opportunity for a human error.\nA test conductor\'s console shall be provided. It shall contain the\ncontrols and indicators necessary for maintaining responsibility\nfor the stage checkout and coordinating all checkout activities.\n\nd.\n\nTest stations which group functionally similar stage systems shall\nbe provided. These stations shall provide the cognizant system\nengineers with sufficient data to determine the condition of the\n3\n\nsystem under test. It shall provide the station operator with the\ncapability of calling up subroutines for fault location, etc. It shall\nalso provide the operator a means of local control for manually\ninserting steps to enable the program to continue,\n\ne.\n\n5\n\n4\n\nI-\n\nFunctions unique to a particular stage system will be grouped in an\nappropriate test station. However, the existence of a unique system does not justify the existence of a test station for it alone. In\nan instance where a system requires only a small quantity of\ncheckout equipment, that equipment will be grouped in an existing\ntest station.\n\n,\n\n3\n2-28\n\n,\n\nf.\n\nThe test complex shall be assembled in modular form. These\nmodules shall, i n general, be standard, commercially available\nitems. Unique test complex configurations can then be attained\nthrough the use of patchboards, etc.\n\ng.\n\nA manual safeing capability shall be provided. This function shall\nbe controlled by the test station operators. It shall act independently of the computer and perform all of the functions necessary\n\nto render the vehicle safe. This requirement specifies that a\nmanual/automatic interface be designed into the stage/ground\ninterface distributor (see paragraph 2 8 3 .\n..)\n\nh.\n\nA digital event evaluator shall be provided.\n\nThis unit shall be\n\ncapable of scanning all discrete stage output lines continuously,\nrecording event changes, and recording the time of these changes.\ni.\n\nj.\n\nof information between all test personnel should be provided,\nRigid tubing shall be used to route gases and fluids to the stage\n\nk.\n\n.\n\nIt shall be capable of being programmed to evaluate these events.\nA voice intercommunication system which allows the free exchange\n\nwherever practical. This includes routing along work platforms.\nFlexible hose shall be used to connect the distributors to the work\nplatforms and the work platforms to the stage. All supply and\nmonitoring lines shall be designed for a specific application o r test.\nIt shall be labeled and color-coded f o r the. media used or the\nsystem tested. Sufficient pneumatic circuits shall be provided so\nthat it is not necessary to change connections during a test.\nThe emergency vent system shall be an integral part of the pneu-\n\n*\n\ni\n\nJ\n\n".\n\nn\nn\n\n.i\n\nmatic equipment. It will provide for automatic shutdown of pres-\n\nr\'\ni\n\ns u r e and automatic venting whenever specified test pressures are\nexceeded. This system will be continuously operated whenever\npressure is applied to the stage. Visual and audible devices shall\nbe used to detect actuation of the system. A reset capability will\n\n?\nI\n\nd\n\nbe provided in the system so that reset can be effected after pres7\n\nsure has decayed to within safe limits.\n\ni\n\nd\n\n" h ,\n\n1.\'\n\nf\nThe pneumatic system shall be capable o metering and injecting\ntracer gases into the pressurizing system to assure proper Mixing\nof the test gases and tracer gases.\n\n,\nI \'\n\n,\n\n+i\n\nI\n\nm. Ground cooling equipment shall be provided for those systems that\nrequire cooling during periods of extended operation on the ground.\nThe system will be controlled remotely from the electrical test\nstation.\nThe mechanical support equipment shall consist of hydraulic and pneumatic\nequipment capable of supplying stimuli to and measuring responses from the\nstage hydraulic and pneumatic systems. It shall have the capability for local\nmanual control and remote manual and automatic control from the mechanical\ntest station.\nIt will contain regulators, valves, gages, transducers, pumps, servo regulator\nmodules, relief valves, flowmeters, etc. It should provide for the distribution\nof data to the digital event evaluation, to the computer, and to the digital data\nacquisition system.\n\n2.8.3\n\nStage/Ground Interface\n\nThere are certain functions in the ground systems which are an integral portion\n\nof the stage circuitry. These functions a r e sometimes referred to as "relaying,\n"interlocking, "relay logic, etc. The purpose of these functions is to assure\n\n\'\'\n\nthat no switching can be done unless the prerequisites for that switching have\nbeen accomplished. The prerequisites are, in general, required for safe\noperation.\nThese functions shall be grouped in a separate piece of equipment which provides\nthe stage/test complex interface. The three primary reasons for this interface\nequipment are :\na. Critical functions can be hardlined back t o the test station to provide a manual safeing capability.\nb.\n\nA single rack or group of racks can be identified which adapt the\n\nstage to a general-purpose test complex.\n\nc.\n_ -\n\nProgramming is simplified. Changes in stage interlocking o r relay\nlogic can generally be made with no effect on the checkout pro=\ngrams unless, of course, the switching sequence is altered.\n\n\\\n\nFigure 2-11 shows a simple block diagram of a stage checkout complex.

The\nswitching of 32 volts dc on the main dc busses will be accomplished in several\nmilliseconds and will bring the main dc busses from the already existing 24 volts dc\nup to 32 volts dc.\n2-33\n\n\\\n\n-?\ni\n\n1\n\nAn adequ t number of power outlets shall be conveniently located in all areas where\ntests will be conducted to facilitate easy access and flexibility of location for all\nmobile electrical equipment which will be utilized during stage checkout.\nAdequate power and RF grounding shall be provided in the checkout area and for all\n\napplicable stage and checkout equipment.\nSufficient R F shielding shall be provided on all equipment and in all areas where such\nareas or equipments would be adversely affected by the R F radiation which will exist\nin the checkout complex.\n\nI\n\nMotor-generator sets will be provided as a power source for all equipments which are\nadversely affected by normal power transients.\nVisual indicators and continuous recording devices will be provided to monitor and\nrecord important power parameters.\nI\n\nI\n\ne\n\nEmergency battery-powered lighting shall be provided in all test and equipment areas.\nGround connections will be checked to insure that there is no difference in potential\nbetween grounds.\nPersonnel access platforms, which also provide mechanical-electrical tie-in to the\nstage, shall be provided to adequately check out the stage.\nConvenience power outlets to support testing shall be provided on the work platforms\nat all work levels.\nLight fixtures for illuminating test areas within the stage shall be fixed permanently to\nwork platforms and/or provided convenient within the stage.\nA clean storage area shall be provided in o r adjacent to the cell for storage and\n\nissuance of all test fixtures and test hoses.\nTest media shall flow through a supply systex, .

This checkout is\ngenerally accomplished at three specific times before the stage is transported to\nthe launch site. These a r e as follows:\n\nrq\n\na.\n\n..\n\nb.\n\nManufacturing Checkout: performed upon completion of the assembly process.\nPre-Captive Test Firing (CTF) Checkout: performed prior to\n\nc.\n\nthe CTF.\nPost-CTF Checkout: performed after the CTF.\n\nJ\n\n1\n\nf\nc;\n\nThe series of tests performed at these three times a r e similar. Test requirements may be altered somewhat due to the different objectives, but since checkout is, in general, the operation of the system, the alterations are not extensive.\nThis section describes the post-CTF that occurs subsequent to the CTF. The\npost-CTF is the most complete of the assembled stage test series. Manufacturing checkout does not include the steering over-all o r plug drop tests. Pre-CTF\ncheckout includes only those tests that the procuring activity requires to verify\nthat the condition of the stage has not deteriorated as a result of its shipping\n\nLj\n\nenvironment, and provide assurance that the CTF will produce usable data with\n\na minimum of predictable damage to the stage.\nPrior to checkout the GSE undergoes verification testing. This testing is accom-\n\nt\n\nplished to insure that the GSE satisfies engineering requirements and will be\ncompatible with the stage, It also provides a verification .of the checkout programs. This testing is accomplished with a vehicle simulator designated the\nground equipment test set (GETS).\n\n...\n\n.\n\nIn concert with the building block concept; the stage is subjected to the series of\ntests shown on Figure 2-13. These tests are described in detail in Section 2.11,\n\n245 .\n\n1\n\n*\n\n.\n\n1.\n\n: . 1\n\n9\n,\n\n"3.1\n\ni\n\n\\\n\n:2-46\n\nand the tests consists, generally, of a checkout of the networks, subsystems, and\n\nsystems which culminate in the simulated flight test (plugs in and/or out). During\nthis test all systems are sequentially operated through their prelaunch and post.\nW\n\n\'\n7\n\nlaunch functions. Flight conditions (other than the special environment provided\nby actual engine operation and flight) are simulated. This test verifies that the \'\nstage will operate as an integrated system and in accordance with its design intent. Removal of any part o r component that is a functional part of this test,\nwhich produces o r reacts to stimuli or otherwise affects the operation of another\npart o r component, will require that the simulated flight test be re-run. The\ndecision to re-run systems tests or other levels of tests must be made in consideration of the facts surrounding the failure and the preciseness of the fault isolation techniques employed in localizing the failure.\nNormally, repair activities will be limited to replacement of parts and/or components in the factory and at field test sites. Repair\' of parts or components will\nbe made in laboratories which have been especidly equipped for thisf type of activity,\n\nns,\nU\n\nThe tests described in this section represent an application of the concepts related\n\nin the other parts of Section 2.0 of this document. Any deviation to the requirements of this section should be coordinated with the procuring activity.\nThe general objectives of assembled stage checkout are described in Section 2.4.\n\np\nr 1\n\nt :\n.\n\nY\n\nSpecific objectives for each test are listed in this section along with the detailed\ntest requirements and a description of the test. It is emphasized, that the test\nconductors and test engineering personnel performing these tests should be\nthoroughly familiar with the stage and the stage checkout complex. This is necessary in order to realize the accomplishment of the intent of the objectives and\nthe acquisition of the specified data.\n\nn\n\nu\n\np\nJ\nt\n\nThe general requirements for assembled stage checkout are as follows:\na. Stage checkout equipment shall be verified with vehicle simulation\n.\n\n,\n-\n\nb.\n\nprior to its being hooked-up to the stage.\nA power distribution checkout shall be performed before general\n\nc.\n\nnetworks testing,\nEach subsystem (including electrical networks) shall be checked out\nseparately in the vehicle networks before the integrated stage tests.\n(This is done to avoid the confusion caused by the interaction of system.)\n\n247\n_.\n\n--.\n\n~\n\n_.-_... . .. .\n\nc\n\n.\n\nd.\n\nTelemetry calibration should be performed after the completion of\nsubsys tems testing.\n\ne.\nf\n.\n\nThe final test shall be a simulated flight test with the stage cycled\nthrough a simulated countdown and flight.\nMeasured parameters shall be those presently instrumented in the\nflight system, whenever possible.\n\ng.\n\nThe seqcence of tests shall represent operational conditions as\nclosely a s possible.\n\nh.\n\nEMI tests shall be conducted on all systems and subsystems, as\n\ni.\n\napplicable, as a part of an active EMC program.\nTechnical personnel (engineers and technicians), who have skill\nlevels commensurate with their responsibilities, shall be provided.\n\nj.\n\nSufficient numbers of personnel shall be provided to man the stations\n\nk.\n\nand perform the functions associated with this checkout.\nNo component scheduled for flight shall be used to check out another\n\ncomponent, When two flight articles or$ interconnected, the objeotive of the test should be to verify their compatibility.\nThe remainder of this section contains examples which illustrate the implementation of the above requirements. Specific requirements are given, where\napplicable.\n2.11.2\n\nGround Support Equipment Verification\n2.11.2.1\n\nGeneral Objectives\n\nPrior to receiving the stage, all complex an^ ground support equipment\nis checked with the use of a ground equipment test set (GETS). This\nequipment is designed very flexibly by using patchboards with plug-in\nrelay, diode, and switch modules and serves to obtain two objectives:\nthe first is to check out the GSE to verify that it is designed properly,\nand that it is capable of checking out a stage; the second objective is to\ncheck out the programs that are to be used during stage checkout. This\n\n$\n\nis accomplished by designing the GETS to present the same interface to\n\n.. i .\n\nthe GSE as an actual stage.\n\nb.\n\n,!\n\ni\n\nI\n\n,\n\n.\n\n23\n\ns\n\nJ\n\nFor those stage responses\'that are presented on DDAS, \'a prerecorded\ntape is available that will be played into the DDAS ground station at the\nappropriate time\n2.11.2.2\n\n.\n\nGeneral Requirements\n\nTo verify a new checkout complex, several tests will have to be performed; however, after the complex has been used to check out a stage,\nthe only testing needed would be to verify any changes. There is noneed\nin continually reverifying everything, and the GSE will be undergoing\n\n,\n-\n\n.i,I\ni\n;\n\ntesting while developing the test programs for the succeeding stages.\nIn checking out a new complex four distinct tests will be performed,\nmodification verification, power distribution and pneumatic components,\ngeneral networks and malfunction, and over-all test.\n\nd\n\nI\n\nI\n\n2.11.2.3\n.\n\nGeneral Functional\' Description\n\n1\n\nL\n\n\'\n3\nid\n\n."\n\nPrior to starting the tests to verify the GSE operational capability, its\n\n.\n\nstatus is determined by checking all electrical and mechanical compo-\n\nb\n\nnents to assure that they have been properly inspected and installed. All\nmissing components and damaged wiring shall be listed and r e p l a e e m e L -\n\nor rework requested.\nAfter the stage hardware status has been checked against documentation\nand the mechanical checks are completed, the GSE will undergo a complete checkout utilizing the GETS before it is mated to the.stage. The\ninitial test will be an end-to-end continuity measurement on all wiring\n\nand cabling to assure proper connections through the entire system. A\nrework is issued on any incorrect conditions and the inspection is then\nrepeated. Megger checks a r e made on all cabling to assure adequate\nisolation between wiring. Measurement of all GSE power busses is\nmade to verify conformance to calculated connected load. All busses\n\nare then checked to ascertain that they may be energized from the correct power supplies and in the correct sequence. The proper operation\nof all voltage, current, and sequence recorders associated with facilities is confirmed; moreover, verifying that the sequence recorders are\n\n2-49\n\n\\\n\npatched to record the prescribed events and yield the proper lamp illumination indications.\n\ni\n\n*\n\n9\n\nEach circuit is then energized to ascertain that it\n\nreceives power from the proper source. Subsequently, the functioning\nof each component is compared with its design intent and its compatibility with the complete system, including all elements of guidance and con-\n\n.\n\n. .\n\ntrol, telemetry, and RF systems. A test is performed to verify that all\nsequences and programs function properly to simulate stage firing, and .\nthat all methods of initiating engine-cutoff produce the proper sequences\nand indications. Also, the proper functioning of all circuits associated\nwith stage launch and malfunction engine-cutoff conditions is made. The\ncompatibility of the control computer and GSE is ascertained by observing\nthe responses to prescribed simulated positions. During the GSE verification testing, all test programs for stage testing are verified. Following the completion of GSE verification, the stage simulator is removed\nand the GSE is connected to the stage-for-stage checkout.\n2.11.2.4\n\nModification Verification\n2.11.2.4.1\n\nObjectives\n\nThe objectives of the modification verification test are as\nfollows:\na.\n\nVerify the installation of all modifications\nrequired to update the checkout equipment,\nprior to delivery of the stage, has been\n\nb.\n\naccomplished.\nVerify that all modified equipment has been\nproperly checked out.\n\n2.11.2.4.2\n\nRequirements\n\nThe modification verification test consists of the following:\na.

The output\nof the signal conditioner is returned to ground via the DDAS, where it\n\nis colqpared in the computer to the stored calibrated value.

When the signal conditioner is\ncalibrated, the technician presses a button which informs the computer\nhe has finished and is going on to the next signal conditioner. This test\nconsists of the physical actuation of all transducers after they are installed in the stage. This provides a continuity check from source to\ntelemetry channel, as well as a check on the operation and location of\nthe transducer and its associated circuitry.
