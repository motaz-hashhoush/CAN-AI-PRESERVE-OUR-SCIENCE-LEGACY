Landsat-5 was already\non-orbit. EO-1 and SAC-C successfully joined in November 2000. Landsat-8\nlaunched in February 2013.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Afternoon Constellation (A-Train) began with the Aqua launch in May 2002,\nfollowed by Aura in July 2004, PARASOL in December 2004, and the joint\nCALIPSO/CloudSat launch in April 2006 (\xe2\x80\x9cformation flying\xe2\x80\x9d)\n\xe2\x80\xa2 A-Train Mission Operations Working Group (MOWG) officially met for the\nfirst time in March 2003, preceded by an exploratory discussion between LaRC\n(John Stadler) and GSFC (Angie Kelly and Lauri Newman)\n\xe2\x80\xa2 OCO (2010) and Glory (2011) launches failed due to launch vehicle fairing\nproblems\n\xe2\x80\xa2 GCOM-W1 successfully launched in May 2012\n\xe2\x80\xa2 OCO-2 successfully launched in July 2014\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Next missions: ?\n5\n\nMission Operations Working Group\nJune 2-4, 2015\n\nSignificant Meeting Topics\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nTerra Exit Plans\nCALIPSO Laser Swap Plans\nCALIPSO and CloudSat Future Plans\nOCO-2 First Year of operations\nCommunications with Foreign Satellite Operators (FSOs) \xe2\x80\x93 Status update\nRevised CARA Concept of Operations \xe2\x80\x93 Lessons learned\nSpring 2015 IAM Series Lessons Learned\n\xe2\x80\x9cNo slew\xe2\x80\x9d maneuvers for Aqua \xe2\x80\x93 Status update\nCCS Future Release Plans\nNASA HQ Perspective (including Senior Review status and the planned\n2016 Science Symposium)\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Current state of the missions, end-of-mission plan, and action plan for\nunexpected credible contingencies\n6\n\nMission Operations Working Group\nJune 2-4, 2015\n\nState of the Constellations\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Morning Constellation\n\xe2\x80\x93 Terra and its 5 instruments are performing nominally, except ASTER SWIR.\n\xe2\x80\x93 Landsat 7 and Landsat 8 are performing nominally\n\xe2\x80\x93 EO-1 is currently ~22 km below Landsat 7 & Terra; continuing science observations\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Afternoon Constellation\n\xe2\x80\x93 A-Train IAM Series (Spring 2015) successfully conducted\n\xe2\x80\x93 OCO-2 is completing its first year in the A-Train.\n\xe2\x80\x93 Aqua, Aura, and GCOM-W1 are performing nominally\n\xe2\x80\x93 CloudSat is operating in Daylight-only Operation (Do-Op) mode; formation flying with\nCALIPSO\n\xe2\x80\x93 CALIPSO is performing nominally; making plans to switch lasers\n\nConstellations are operating successfully\nand producing valuable science data\nExcellent cooperation!

Report the conclusions of this\nanalysis in Summer 2015.\n\nPresent the results of their risk study analyzing the Terra exit options. This study will\ninclude the risk of the Terra satellite itself being hit by debris and any subsequent risks to\nthe remaining satellites in the 705-km constellations or satellites attempting to enter or\nexit the constellations. Thus it will entail characterizing the debris environments at the\nrange of altitudes from 4 km below the constellations to re-entry plus the associated\norbital lifetimes associated with Terra starting 4km and 19 km below the 705-km\nreference altitude.\nInvite the NASA Orbital Debris Program Office and the Office of Safety and Mission\nAssurance (OSMA) teams to the next MOWG meeting (which will include a\npresentation of the Aerospace Corporation study results).\n\nOPEN /\nMid-January 2015 summary to ESMO\n(Closed)\nPresent results at the Spring 2015\nMOWG meeting\n\nCLOSED / April 2015\n\nProvide CARA with the list of e-mail addresses to receive legacy reports once the new\nCLOSED / October 24, 2014.\nreport becomes the regular CARA report.
