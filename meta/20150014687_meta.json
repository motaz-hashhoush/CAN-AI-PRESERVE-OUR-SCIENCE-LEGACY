The vehicle concept is based on six wheels at the ends of six multi-degree-of-freedom limbs. Because each limb has enough degrees of freedom for use as a general-purpose leg, the wheels can be locked and used as feet to walk out of excessively soft or other extreme terrain. Since the vehicle has this alternative mode of traversing through (or at least out of) extreme terrain, the wheels and wheel actuators can be sized only for nominal terrain. There are substantial mass savings in the wheels and wheel actuators associated with designing for nominal instead of extreme terrain. These mass savings are comparable-to or larger-than the extra mass associated with the articulated limbs. As a result, the entire mobility system, including wheels and limbs, can be about 25 percent lighter than a conventional mobility chassis for planetary exploration. A side benefit of this approach is that each limb has sufficient degrees-of-freedom for use as a general-purpose manipulator (hence the name \"limb\" instead of \"leg\"). Our prototype ATHLETE vehicles have quick-disconnect tool adapters on the limbs that allow tools to be drawn out of a \"tool belt\" and maneuvered by the limb. A rotating power-take-off from the wheel actuates the tools, so that they can take advantage of the 1-plus-horsepower motor in each wheel to enable drilling, gripping or other power-tool functions.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20150014687, "endDate": "2009-03-14T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers", "location": "New York, NY, United States"}}, "meetingId": "11c8405ea4444ba4b4254ef230baabf1", "id": "9d3326183d6f45b4b0c13ed3b4dc81a9"}], "name": "2009 IEEE Aerospace Conference", "location": "Big Sky, MT", "id": "11c8405ea4444ba4b4254ef230baabf1", "startDate": "2009-03-07T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20150014687, "id": "bccd91c8412d40db9c940f131e91b9f4", "publicationDate": "2009-03-07T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
