The power module, planned for availability in 1984, could also support a Spacelab modified to be a free-flyer by providing attitude control and power. In addition, development of a 250-kW power module to support a Shuttle-tended space platform or a Shuttle-tended space construction base is projected. A free-flying teleoperator capable of deboosting Skylab, systems to construct large planar arrays in space, and a habitable module providing crew quarters for continuously manned operations are also described.", "title": "Next steps in space transportation and operations", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-09T09:31:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19780035634, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Disher, J.
