Marshall Space Flight Center, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, on 18 July 1963. The briefing and this document are intended to present the general status of the NERVA (Nuclear Engine for Rocket Vehicle Application) nuclear rocket development, the characteristics of certain operational NERVA-class engines, and appropriate technical and schedule information. Some of the information presented herein is preliminary in nature and will be subject to further verification, checking and analysis during the remainder of the study program. In addition, more detailed information will be prepared in many areas for inclusion in a final summary report. This work has been performed by REON, a division of Aerojet-General Corporation under Subcontract 74-10039 from the Lockheed Missiles and Space Company. The presentation and this document have been prepared in partial fulfillment of the provisions of the subcontract. From the inception of the NERVA program in July 1961, the stated emphasis has centered around the demonstration of the ability of a nuclear rocket to perform safely and reliably in the space environment, with the understanding that the assignment of a mission (or missions) would place undue emphasis on performance and operational flexibility. However, all were aware that the ultimate justification for the development program must lie in the application of the nuclear propulsion system to the national space objectives.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 19760073676, "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "NASA Marshall Space Flight Center", "location": "Huntsville, AL, United States"}}, "meetingId": "bb39b676027f4bfbba1902b34d440b3b", "id": "1699b3e813274db3a81f4a626e2a41bb"}], "name": "Nuclear Lunar Logistics Study Briefing", "location": "Huntsville, AL", "id": "bb39b676027f4bfbba1902b34d440b3b", "startDate": "1963-07-18T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 19760073676, "id": "fcd08d99e41841df91e08b44cfe215ce", "publicationDate": "1963-07-18T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19760073676.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19760073676/downloads/19760073676.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19760073676/downloads/19760073676.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19760073676/downloads/19760073676.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
