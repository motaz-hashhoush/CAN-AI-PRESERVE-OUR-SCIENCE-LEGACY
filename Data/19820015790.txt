This reduces the packing\nefficiency, which approaches 0 5 X for square cells, to about 78%. This\nreduces the conversion efficic.cy of the module by the same ratio. Shaping\nthese ingots into squares with regrowth of cut silicon improves the packing\nfactor, but increases growth cost.\nBy considering shaping ingots in stages from full round to complete\nsquare, a study of the cost impact on solar cell modules has been made. The\nsequence of module production with relevant price allocation guidelines is\noutlined. The effect of silicon utilization on sheet price is illustrated.\nTrade-offs due to shaping of ingot are discussed. Sheet and module prices\nare calculated for various slicing and material utilization scenarios.\nEffect of balance of system is outlined.\nINTRODUCTION\nThe objective of the Low-Cost Solar Array (LSA) Prcject is to develop\ntechnologies for achieving a goal of $0.70Ipeak watt (Wp)* for flat-plate\nphotovoltaic modules by 1986. The working module evolves from silicon\nmaterial formed into sheets. Conventionally, it is produced b growing\n:\ncylindrical single-crystal ingots using Czochralski growers and slicing the\ningot into circular wafers. These wafers are then processed to produce\nphotovoltaic cells and are interconnected in close-packed flat strings with\nseries-parallel combinations for electrical output. Encapsulation and module\nassembly ' then done to provide rigidity, reliability and long life.\ns\nThe price goal of $0.70/wp is broken down for each stage of module\nmanufacture in Reference 1, based on performance criteria of material usage,\nprocess yields, efficiencies, etc., expected to be achieved during technology development.\n\n*All figures are in 1980 dollars.\n187\n\nq b\n\n.\n\n,\n\n,..,.\n\n,.\nd\n\n..\n\n,\n\n,-,.\n\n.r-\n\n.\n\n,\n\n. ...,..... .\n\n.\n\nI\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n.\n\n.\n\n-\n\nr\n\nr r .\n\n., . -,.r\n.-.\n.\n\n.. .\n\n-\n\nConversion e f f i c i e n c y of a module is important i n determining i t s\np r i c e .

Table 3 lists formulas used in this analysis.\nimproved Packing and d + k versus Recycled St licon\nFor a given parallel f :e distance C, the Ingot diameter can he varied\n.\nfrom D\nC to D = 2.C. For a given C, the value of d + k is obtained by\nlinear interpolation, with the end values fixed as 16 mils for C a 10 rm,\n20 mil for C = 15 cm. Bv comparing the new allowable add-on sheet prtce to\nthe new growth price, inclusive of recycled silicon, the advantage due to\nshaping is obtained as shown in Figure 3. For a given C, say 10 cm, the\ningot growth add-on decreases with an increase in D (see Tahlc 2 ) . Further,\nthe allowable sheet price increases due to etter packing. Thus, a 12-cm-dia\nqp of 0.91. However,\ningot gives a price advantage of ahout )61mq\nbeyond a 12-cm-din the growth cost reduction is compensated by increased\nrecycling of silicon, and the advantage is lost. A maximum cost saving of\n3\n12 cm\nnearly $8/mL is obtained ;or a 15-cm-dia ingot with shaping, given C\nand 7\n0.92.\nP\n\n-\n\nSlicing Cost\nThe cost :jf slicing greatly depends upon cross-sectional dimensions of\nthe ingot being cut. Three different cost scenarios are considered in the\nprescnt analysis:\nFor an ingot with larger cross-sectional dimensions, the\nCa c (i):\nslicing speed may be lower and the blade life may be inferior. The cost of\nthe machine m y also he higher than that for an ingot with smaller dimensions. Based on these nssi~mptionsthe add-on slicing cost wlll increase\nwith increasing C [Figure 4, Case (ill.\nCase (ti): The parameter may be adjusted so a constant add-on cost\nmay be attainable regardless of ingot dimensions [Fi~ure Case (ti)).\n4,\n\n25\n\n/.A\n/.Re\n\n--- -,*--\n\n-\n\n0.\n\nIS\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\n13\n\n14\n\n'\n\n------\n\nJfii)\n\n(ii)\n\n15\n\nINGOT DLA., D (an)\n\nFig, 4 Three Scenarios of Slicing\nCost a8 a Function of\nDepth of Cut, C\n\nFig. 3\n.\n\nCost Saving h e to Shaping\nas a Function of Ingot\nDiameter\n\nFig. 5.\n\nModule Price am a Function of C for the Slicing Scenarior,\nCa8e8 ( i ) , (ii), and (iii), of Figure 4\n\nCase (iii): With proper development efforts, increased blade life and\nslicing rate can be achieved. Automation will result in reduced labor cost.\nThus, increased throughput due to larger diameter will result in reduced\nadd-on slicing cost [Figure 4, Case (iii)].\nIn addition, a rough estimate of shaping cost, based on IPEG analysis\n(Reference 4) using an outer diameter (OD) saw, gives an add-on cost of\ne\n$1.80/m of ingot length. This can b done by one blade, or two parallel\nblades, with the ingot rotated 9 \xc2\xb0 after completion of each cut.\n0\nFigure 5 shows the module price in $ 1 for ~\n~ the three slicing scenarios.\nThe price of the module is least for the largest-diameter ingots. As expected,\nCase (I) shows maximum a~.antagedue to shaping of a 15-cm-dia ingot to a\nTable 3.\n\nList of Formulas\n\n$/up (module)\n\npm\n\n$/m2 (module)\n\np m = Pm\n\nEncapsulation\nMatertals\nAdd-on\n\n$/m2 (module)\n\n%l\n\n$/wp (module)\n\ncml\n\nModule Assembly\nAdd-on\n\n$/m2\n\nModule Price\n\n(module)\n\n=\n\n.1\n\n*'lm\n\nCml/l\n\n'\n\n3\n,\n\n%2\n\n$/w, (module)\n\n~ m 2 CI1:?/I\n=\n\n$ 1 (module)\n~ ~\n\nPC\n\n'\nI\nm\n\nCell Price\n\nCell Fabrication\nAdd-on\n\n-\n\npm - (cml\n\ncC = CC\n\n$/m2 (sheet)\n\nPsh =c(\n'\n\n$/up (module)\nSilicon Price\n\nCc\n\n$/up (module)\nSheet Price\n\n$/m2 (cell)\n\npsh\n\n)\n\n+\n\n7\n\n$/mL (sheet)\n\ncsi\n\n-\n\n- Tp/I\n-\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n7m\n\n'\n\nYm\n\nCC) c\n'\n\nPc - c\n'\n10.0591\n\n(d\n\n+\n\nk)\n\n. si]/YSh\n\nSi is silicon prjce, $/kg\n$/up (module)\nSheet Add-on\n\nCsi ' Csi\n\n'\n\n'1~11 '\n\n$/m2 (sheet)\n\nCsh ' '\ns\nh\n\n-\n\n'\ns\ni\n\nTm\n\nY\n,\n\n'\n\nYc\n\ncomplete square of C=ll cm. Cases (if) and (iii) rhou that in general\nthere will be a value of C between full circle and full square, resulting in\nminimum module price. A saving of about 2 to 10 t/Wp ir obtainable by\nshaping, depending upon the slicing scenario used.\nA similar calculation is done for a 15-cm-die ingot with two different\nd + k values at C = 15 cm of 24 mils and 20 mils. Bowever, the d + k value\nis kept constant at 16 ails for C = 10 cm. Linear interpolations have been\ndone for intermediate C values for both cases. The resulting module prices\nare shown by the two curves in Figure 6. This shows that the module price\nwill be higher for larger d + k as expected, but the advantage of shaping\nwill be even greater.\nArray Installation\nIncreased packing factor and the consequent improved module efficiency\nhas an added advantage when array installation costs are considered\n)\nThus a 102 efficient, $0.701~ module will need $0.60/wp\n(Reference 5.\nadd-on for a $6O.Oh 2 array installation, resu!ting\nin a total installed\nWith the same total array installed prlce of fl.301Wp,\nprice of $l.301Wp.\none could afford to pay more than $ 0 . 7 0 1 ~ ~\nfor the module if its efficiency\n1s greater than 10%. The module price, h, in $/up would then be shown\nas :\n\nBased on this premise, Figure 7 shows the savings (p,- module price\nper watt with shaping) as e tunction of C with D as a parameter. Consfderable saving is obtained with ingot shaping for all values of D from 10 cm to\n15 cm. A maximum advantage of about 15d/Wp is achievable by squaring a\n15-cr aia ingot.\n\nFig. 6.\n\nEffect of d + k and\nShaping on nodule\nPrice\n\nFig. 7.\n\nEffect of Array Installation\nand Shaping on Module Price\n\nDISCUSSION\nShaping ingots for solar photovoltaic modules affect module price In\nvarious ways. Slicing thinner pieces and reducing kerf saves polysilicon\nmaterial and reduces the ingot growth cost. Similarly, improvement in packing factor reduces encapsulation cost. These cost benefits are, however,\noffset to a certain extent by regrowth cost of cut silicon and the shaping\ncosts involved. Additional cost benefits occur in the balance of the system\nbec,use of a more efficient module.\nThere may be other advantages of shaping, such as ease in slicing of\nmultiple ingots and processing of square cells, etc. Incomplete squares\nwith :ounded corners may have the advantages of less chipping of corners\nduring slicing and available spaces for interconnects.\nCost reduction in slicing of large-d .-.meter\ningots may make shaping\nless attractive. High shaping costs and poor ingot growth yields will also\nhave a similar effect.\nCONCLUSION\nThe severe penalties in add-on price due to increasing slice thickness\nand kerf are presented. Trade-offs between advantages of improved packing\nefficiencies and material use and disadvantages of recycling silicon and\nshaping costs are developed for different slicing scenarios. It is shown\nthat shaping results in cost saving of up to 21% for a 15-cm dia ingot.\nACKNOWLEDGMENT\nThe author wishes to thank K. M. Koliwad, M. H. Leipold, and J. K. Liu\nfor helpful discussions.
