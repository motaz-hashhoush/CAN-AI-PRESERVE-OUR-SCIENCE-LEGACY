The MMS mission was launched on March 12, 2015. The MMS mission consists of four identically instrumented spin-stabilized observatories which are flown in formation to perform the first definitive study of magnetic reconnection in space. The MMS mission was presented with numerous technical challenges, including the simultaneous construction and launch of four identical large spacecraft with 100 instruments total, stringent electromagnetic cleanliness requirements, closed-loop precision maneuvering and pointing of spinning flexible spacecraft, on-board GPS based orbit determination far above the GPS constellation, and a flight dynamics design that enables formation flying with separation distances as small as 10 km. This paper describes the overall mission design and presents an overview of the design, testing, and early on-orbit operation of the spacecraft systems and instrument suite.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "publications": [{"volume": "199", "submissionId": 20170002236, "issue": "1", "issn": "0038-6308", "publisher": "Springer International Publishing", "eissn": "1572-9672", "id": "3ca78382d8134e7d9e94349070c8a1ae", "publicationName": "Space Science Reviews", "publicationDate": "2015-11-24T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
