This program provides dose estimates for Galactic cosmic rays (GCR) and large and ordinary solar proton flare events for various amounts of effective spacecraft shielding and a given time history of the spacecraft's heliocentric position. The results of this study show that most of the missions can survive the most recent large flares if a 25 g/sq cm storm shelter is assumed. The dose predictions show that missions during solar minima are not necessarily the minimum dose cases, due to increased GCR contribution during this time period. The direct transfer mission studied has slightly lower doses than the outbound Venus swingby mission, with the greatest dose differences for the assumed worst case scenario. The GCR dose for a mission can be reduced by having the crew spend some fraction of its day nominally in the storm shelter.", "title": "Radiation exposure predictions for short-duration stay Mars missions", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-16T01:24:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19930055264, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Striepe, Scott A."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Langley Research Center", "location": "Hampton, VA, United States"}}, "id": "958ba1932c844d1086c1ae1859226d49"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19930055264, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Nealy, John E."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Langley Research Center", "location": "Hampton, VA, United States"}}, "id": "2518fad4eb6b48adbfaa6be526a11f57"}, {"sequence": 2, "submissionId": 19930055264, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Simonsen, Lisa C."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Langley Research Center", "location": "Hampton, VA, United States"}}, "id": "52c69d53b3e143218daf98cd45627d3a"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Reprint (Version printed in journal)", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-19T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19930055264, "publications": [{"volume": "29", "submissionId": 19930055264, "issue": "6", "issn": "0022-4650", "id": "f733c92d1733437eb9fc7ecea106b1ff", "publicationName": "Journal of Spacecraft and Rockets", "publicationDate": "1992-12-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
