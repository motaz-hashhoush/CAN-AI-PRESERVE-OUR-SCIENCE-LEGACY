Fiber placement is being developed specifically for aircraft and other high performance structural applications. Several major milestones have been achieved during process development. These milestones are discussed in this paper. The automated fiber placement process is currently being demonstrated on the NASA ACT program. All demonstration projects to date have focused on fiber placement of transport aircraft fuselage structures. Hercules has worked closely with Boeing and Douglas on these demonstration projects. This paper gives a description of demonstration projects and results achieved.", "title": "Automated fiber placement: Evolution and current demonstrations", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T23:26:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19950022411, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Grant, Carroll G."}, "organization": {"name": "Hercules Aerospace Co.", "location": "Magna, UT, United States"}}, "id": "f4ad16ec60334fbd9d7649d754a07d0d"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19950022411, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Benson, Vernon M."}, "organization": {"name": "Hercules Aerospace Co.", "location": "Magna, UT, United States"}}, "id": "8aba1daeac314e99939874f8dfd8c2a1"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19950022411, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19950022411, "id": "7121cba821864174ac147e2045804e1b", "publicationName": "NASA.
