It is noted that the expected benefits to be attained by this R&D include weight reduction, lowered fuel consumption, and lower direct operating costs. A major effort underway in this area is the Advanced High Temperature Engine Materials Technology Program (HITEMP) of NASA, which focuses on providing revolutionary high-temperature composite materials: to 425 C (800 F) for polymer-matrix composites (PMCs), to 1250 C (2280 F) for metal-matrix/intermetallic-matrix composites (MMCs/IMCs), and to as high as 1650 C (3000 F) for ceramic-matrix composites (CMCs). Analytical modeling is being used to investigate the structural behavior of these advanced materials in six distinct areas: micromechanics, deformation and damage, fatigue, fracture, trade-off studies, and load definition. It is concluded that the development of advanced materials such as high-temperature composites is highly dependent on the availability of high-temperature fibers. The wide range of fiber characteristics needed will require the development of more than one fiber. In general, a candidate fiber should have low density, high strength, high stiffness, a CTE matching the matrix, chemical compatibility with the matrix, environmental stability and appropriate fiber diameter.", "title": "Composites boost 21st-century aircraft engines", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-14T10:45:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19900042649, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Stephens, Joseph R."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Lewis Research Center", "location": "Cleveland, OH, United States"}}, "id": "73acb166f60c4fb28e008e467c3d0117"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Reprint (Version printed in journal)", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-12-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19900042649, "publications": [{"volume": "137", "submissionId": 19900042649, "issn": "0882-7958", "id": "d221c71f46d84d42967e936f4e406da2", "publicationName": "Advanced Materials and Processes", "publicationDate": "1990-04-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
