The most difficult task was to\nestimate the number of early tornadoes in 1916-50 when the reporting efficiency\nwas very bad, resulting in undercounting of the incidents. In generating the\nbest possible data, Fujita\'sTornado Tape produced at the University of Chicago,\nthe book "Significant Tornadoes, 1880-1989" by Thomas\nP. Grazulis, and the\nNSSFC Tornado Tape were combined.\nFirst, the "Annual Number\nof Tornadoes"\nwere smoothed\nto obtain the\n"Smoothed Number\nof Annual Tornadoes" which was normalized to the "Standard\nNumber\nof Tornadoes" defined as the mean number\nin the recent 30 years,\n1960-89. The "Normalization Factor" was obtained by computing the ratio\nof smoothed and standard number. In the early years, the factor was in excess\nof 7.\nThereafter, the "Normalized\nNumber\nof Annual Tornadoes"\nand plotted, finding that the resultsare very satisfactory.\n\nwas\n\ncomputed\n\nIn order to visualize the variation of tornado activities,the "Tornado Activity\nNumber\n(TAN)" was initiated and computed.\nThe TAN\nincluding all annual\ntornadoes\nshow\ncertain periodicity. For\nclimatological evaluation, the\npeak-activity day of each year, such as Superoutbreak day, 3 April 1974, Palm\nSunday, II April 1965 were eliminated. The TAN, excluding peak-day tornadoes,\nis of extreme interest.\n\nPlans for Next Year\nThis study will continue in an attempt to relate tornado activities with other\nclimatological events such as E1 Niho, La Ni_a, sunspots, etc.\nMeanwhile, individual case studies and synoptic analyses of special cases will\nbe performed for better understanding of tornado climatology.\n\nPRYING\n53\n\nPAGE\n\nBLANK\n\nNOT\n\nFILhtE.U\n\nAnnual\n\nNumber\n\nof Tornadoes\n1200\n\nI000\n\xc2\xb0\n\n800\n\n600\n\n400\n200\n\n1920\n\n1930\n\n1940\n\n1950\n\nSmoothed\n\n1960\n\nNumber\n\nof Annual\n\n1970\n\n1980\n\n1990\n\nTornadoes\n1200\n\nI000\nFO - 5\n\n5_\n\n800\n\nFI-5\n_-\n\n_ _---"\n\n/\n\n600\n\nF2 - 5\n\n__--1920\n\n1930\nStandard\n\n1940\nNumber\n\n1950\nor\n\nthe\n\n_-\n\n_---1960\n\nMean\n\nNumber\n\n1400\n\n_2oo\n\n1970\nin\n\n30\n\ni\n\nYears,\n\n1980\n\n1990\n\n1960-89\n\nB\n\n1200\n\nI000\n\no\n\nStandard\n\nFO-5\n\n8O0\n\nt,\nFI-5\n\n600\n\no\n\n400\n:_\n\nF2-5\n200\nF4-5\n1920\n\n1930\nSmoothed\n\nF3-5\n\n1940\nand\n\n1950\n\nStandard\n\n1960\n\nNumber\n\nof\n\n1970\n\nTornadoes\n\n1980\n\n1990\n\nCombined\n1200\n1(300\n\nStandard\nil\n\n\'\n\nt\n\nFO-5\n\n_\n\n,.-r .......................\n\nFO-5\ni\n\nFI-5\n\n,\n\n-:_\n\n__\n\nF II_\n\n_\n\n_\n1920\n\n1930\n\n1940\n\n1950\n\n1960\n\n1970\n\n1980\n\n800\n600\n\noo\n200\n1990\n\n=\n\n54\n\n=\n\nNormalization\n\nFactor\n7\n6\n\no\n\n5\nFO- 5\n\nIA.\n\n4\n\nFI-5\n\n3\nF2-5\n2\n\nF3-5\nF5ond\n\nF4-5\n\n_9.2o \'\n\n1_3o\n\nd4o\n\nNormalized\n\'\n\n\'\n\n"\n\n\'\n\n19\'so\n\nNumber\n\nof Annual\n\n\'\n\n19\'7o\n\n19\'6o\'\n\n19\'80\n\n1_90\n\nTornadoes\n\n....\n\n"11200\n\n_l\n\nFo-5\n\n1920\n\n1930\n\n1940\n\nTornado\n\nActivity\n\n1950\nNumber\n\n,ooo\n\n1960\n(TAN)\n\n1970\n\nof Annual\n\n1980\n\n1990\n\nTornadoes\n6O\n\nIn\noJ\n\nh_\n\nL,")\n\',,0\n\nh..\noa\n\n_\n\n5O\n\n0,,I\n\n4o\n\n,_\n\n30\n\n10\n\n1920\n\n1930\n\n1940\nTAN\n\nexcluding\n\n1950\n\n1960\n\nTornadoes\n\non One\n\n1970\nPeak\n\n1980\n\nDay\n\n1990\n\n6O\n5O\n\nIn\nr,-\n\nh,.\nIn\n\n_,)\nI\'q\n\n4O\n\nO_\nN\n\n0\n\n/\n\n/-xj\n\n1920\n\n_ 30\n\n_.\n\n1930\n\n1940\n\n1960\n\n1950\n\n55\n\n1970\n\n1980\n\n1990\n\n'
