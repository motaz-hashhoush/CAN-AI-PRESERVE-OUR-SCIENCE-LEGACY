b'Radiation Tolerant, FPGA-based SmallSat\nComputer System\nThe Radiation Tolerant, FPGA-based SmallSat\nComputer System (RadSat) computing\nplatform exploits a commercial off-the-shelf\n(COTS) Field Programmable Gate Array\n(FPGA) with real-time partial reconfiguration\nto provide increased performance, power\nefficiency and radiation tolerance at a fraction\nof the cost of existing radiation hardened\ncomputing solutions. This technology is ideal\nfor small spacecraft that require state-of-theart on-board processing in harsh radiation\nenvironments but where using radiation\nhardened processors is cost prohibitive.\nThe technical readiness level of this computer\nsystem has steadily increased over the\npast eight years through a variety of tests\nand demonstrations including heavy ion\nbombardment in cyclotrons, nine high altitude\nballoon flights, and a sounding rocket flight\nto 62 miles (100 kilometers) in 2014. The\ncomputer technology has been selected by\nthe NASA Flight Opportunities Program for\na second sounding rocket flight to 93 miles\n(150 kilometers) in 2016. It has also been\nselected by the NASA Experimental Program\nto Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR)\nprogram for a six-month demonstration on the\nInternational Space Station in 2016. Through\nthe NASA SmallSat Technology Partnership\n\nprogram, the computer technology is being\nintegrated into a 3U CubeSat, a spacecraft\nmeasuring approximately 4 inches x 4 inches\nx 13 inches and weighing approximately 11\npounds (5 kilograms), for an orbital flight\ndemonstration. This work has resulted in\nRadSat being selected by the 2015 CubeSat\nLaunch Initiative for deployment through\nthe NASA Educational Launch of Nanosats\n(ELaNa) program. The launch date is tentatively\nscheduled in the 2016-17 timeframe.\nRadSat uses a novel fault mitigation strategy\ndeveloped by Montana State University (MSU)\nthat takes advantage of partial reconfiguration\nof modern COTS FPGAs. In this approach an\nFPGA is divided into redundant tiles, each with\nthe characteristics that they can fully contain a\ncomputer system core and also be individually\nreprogrammed using partial reconfiguration.\nFor the current RadSat implementation, each\ntile contains a Xilinx MicroBlaze soft processor.\nAt any given time, three of the tiles run in triple\nmodulo redundancy (TMR) with the rest of the\ntiles reserved as spares. The TMR voter is able\nto detect faults in the active triad by voting\non the tile outputs. A configuration memory\nscrubber continually runs in the background\nand is able to detect faults in the configuration\nmemory of both the active and inactive tiles.\nIn the event of a fault in the active triad, (either\n\nThe RadSat Computer Platform is Based on a Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA.\n\ndetected by the TMR voter or scrubber), the damaged\ntile is replaced with a known good spare and foreground\nTMR operation continues. The damaged tile is repaired in\nthe background by reinitializing its configuration memory\nthrough partial reconfiguration. This approach mitigates\nsingle event upsets (SEUs) in the FPGA circuit fabric in\naddition to single event functional interrupts (SEFIs) in the\nconfiguration memory. The advantage of this approach is\nthat foreground operation can continue while the faulted\ntile is repaired and reintroduced into the system in the\nbackground, thus increasing system availability.\nThis approach has been implemented on an Artix-7 200T\nFPGA with 9 MicroBlaze soft processors. This 0.28um\nprocessor implementation has achieved a performance\nof 234 Million Instructions Per Second (MIPS) at 1 watt\nof power consumption. This represents a significant\nimprovement in both performance and power efficiency\ncompared to more widely adopted radiation hardened\ncomputer systems. The 0.28um process node inherently\nprovides 500+ kilorad of Total Ionizing Dose (TID) immunity.\nThe SEU/SEFI fault mitigation approach has been shown to\nprovide a 90x improvement in mean time to failure (MTTF)\ncompared to using Triple Modular Redundancy (TMR) with\nscrubbing alone on an equivalent process node.\nThe RadSat computer system is architected such that\nthe fault mitigation procedures are abstracted from the\ndeveloper. The computer system simply appears as a\nsoft processor-based computer system with all of the\nflexibility inherent in implementing such a system on a\nprogrammable fabric. TID immunity is inherently provided\nthrough the 0.28um process node and SEE immunity\nis provided by the tile replacement procedure in the\nbackground.\n\nPartnerships, a program within the Small Spacecraft\nTechnology Program (SSTP).
