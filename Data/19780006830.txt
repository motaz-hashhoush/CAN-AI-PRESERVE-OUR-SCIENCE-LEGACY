Baehr, Berea; James E.\nBurnett, Cleveland, both of Ohio\n\nThere is disclosed a surgical tissue macerating and removal tool having a rotating rod with a cutting member\nat one end and disposed in a tube which itself is disposed\ncoaxially in an extension of the tool handle. A frustoconical member extends into the extension at the cutter\nmember end of the rotating rod with its small end engaging the tube. The portion of the frusto-conical member outside of the extension forms a tissue engaging\nmember and may be cut-off at an angle to the axis of the\nrod to form a tissue engaging edge. Apertures are provided in the extension adjacent the frusto-conical member so that treatment fluid supplied in the annular space\nbetween the tube and the extension may f o to the\nlw\noperative site. An aperture is provided in the frustoconical member between the extension and the tube so\nthat fluid may also flow into the tube where it mixes\nwith macerated tissue being directed through an aperture in the tube to a passageway which may have suction applied thereto to help remove macerated material.\nRadially-inwardly extending fins may be provided on\nthe interior surface of the frusto-conical member to\ninhibit or prevent rotation of the tissue being macerated\nas, for example, the lens of an eye.\n\n[73] Assignee:\n\nThe United States of America as\nrepresented by the Administrator of\nthe National Aeronautics and Space\nAdministration, Washington, D.C.\n\n[21] Appl.

Parts in FIG. 2 which correing cutter.\nspond to those in FIG. 1 are identified by like numerals.\n\n3\n\n4,06 1,146\n\nAs shown in FIG. 2,the portion 15 of the frusto-conical member interior to the extension 13 is provided with\nan\xe2\x80\x99annular socket 27 for receiving a tube 28 disposed\nwithin the extension 13.The rod 25 which terminates as\na tapered cutter portion 22 rotates within tube 28. As 5\ndescribed previously, extension 13 intersects the frustoconical member at annular juncture 16.\nWith this arrangement, the treatment fluid from passage 20 flows through the annular space between tube\n28 and extension 13 and out through the apertures 21 to 10\nthe operative site. At least one of the apertures, as 21a,\ncommunicates with the interior of tube 28 by means of\nan aperture 31 in the frusto-conical portion 15. This\nallows some of the treatment fluid from passageway 20\nto flow into the interior of tube 28 as indicated by arrow 15\n32 where it mixed with the mixture of macerated tissue\nand treatment fluid being pumped along the cutter portion 22. This dilution helps to prevent binding of the\nrotating rod 25 and cutter 22 in the tube 28. The macerated material and treatment fluid pumped up along the 20\ncutter 22 flows, as indicated by arrows 33 and 34,\nthrough a passageway 23 as described previously.\nTo inhibit or prevent rotation of the tissue being\nmacerated, particularly the lens of the eye, radially\ninwardly extending fins 35 are provided on the interior 25\nsurface of the tissue engaging portion 14 of the frustoconical member. These fins may, if desired, taper from\na minimum htight adjacent the tissue engaging edge 17\nto a maximum height for a specific longitudinal increment and then taper to zero height where they intersect 3\n0\nthe frusto-conical portion 15 at its small end.\nThe passageway 20 is to such size or may have paralle1 passageways so that the pressure drop of the total\ninflow system i very low. The size of passageway 23 is\ns\nselected to control the maximum outflow velocity to 35\nprevent sudden reduction of eye pressure should tlp 17\nlocked when there is a low pressure condidischarge passage. Thus, the outflow passageway 23 is much smaller than the inflow passageway\n\n4\n\na frusto-conical member attached at its small end to\nsaid extension, the large end beiig a tissue engaging\nedge,\nat least one aperture in said extension adjacent said\nfrusto-conical member;\nan annular intermediate wall extending longitudinally between the small end of said frusto-conical member and one end of said tube, and having\nan inflow aperture [passageway] in said intermediate\nwall [extension] in communication with said at least one\naperture in said extension, [and]\nthe interior of said tube beiig in communication with\nan outflow passageway.\n2.
