The project will also be of interest to component manufacturers supplying to high reliability markets. The project was launched in November 2006. The primary technical objective of the project is to undertake comprehensive testing to generate information on failure modes/criteria to better understand the reliability of: (1) Packages (e.g., Thin Small Outline Package [TSOP], Ball Grid Array [BGA], Plastic Dual In-line Package [PDIP]) assembled and reworked with solder interconnects consisting of lead-free alloys (2) Packages (e.g., TSOP, BGA, PDIP) assembled and reworked with solder interconnects consisting of mixed alloys, lead component finish/lead-free solder and lead-free component finish/SnPb solder", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20130012620, "endDate": "2009-12-03T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "2009 DMC", "location": "Orlando, FL", "id": "cd1cd7153b0f4ffb909858897c0f3423", "startDate": "2009-11-30T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20130012620, "id": "5d9cc72dd3124a7cb3a7d0ebabac67a7", "publicationDate": "2009-11-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20130012620.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20130012620/downloads/20130012620.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20130012620/downloads/20130012620.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20130012620/downloads/20130012620.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
