magnitude of the load\n\ncarried by an individual ball depends on the internal geometry\nof the bear; ng and the locat i on of the ba 11 at any instant.\nHaving determined how a bearing carries load, we can determine\nhow it is distributed among the balls.\n\nTo do this, we must\n\nfirst develop load-deflection relationships for the ball-race\ncontact.\n\nThese relationships are developed in Section 3.1 for\n\nany type of elliptical contact, such as those found in a ball\nbearing.\n\nThe deformation within the contact is, among other\n\nthings, a function of the ellipticity parameter and the elliptic\nintegrals of the first and second kinds.\n\nSimplified expressions\n\nthat allow Quick calculations of the deformation to be made\nsimply from a knowledge of the applied load, the material properties, and the geometry of the contacting elements are presented in Section 3.2.\nMost ball bearing applications involve steady-state rotation of either the inner or outer ring, or both.\n\nHowever, the\n\nrotational speeds are usually not so great as to cause centrifugal forces or gyroscopic moments of significant magnitude to act\n\non the ball.\n\nConsequently these effects are ignored in analy-\n\nzing the distribution of radial, thrust, and combined ban loads\nin Section 3.3.\nIn high-speed ball bearings the centrifugal force acting on\nthe individual balls can be significant compared with the\napplied forces acting on the bearing.\n\nIn high-speed bearings\n\nball gyroscopic moments can also be of significant magnitude,\ndepending on the contact angles, such that the inner-race\ncontact angles tend to increase and the outer-race contact\nangles tend to decrease.\n\nIn bearings in which dry friction or\n\nboundary lubrication occurs in the conjunction between the balls\nand races, this can cause a shift of control between races and,\nin some cases, unstable bearing operation.\n\nThis does not occur,\n\nhowever, if the conjunctions experience full elastohydrodynamic\nlubrication.\n\nProcedures for evaluating the performance of\n\nhigh-speed ball bearings are developed in Section 3.4.\n\nElasto-\n\nhydrodynamic lubrication of ball-race contacts is not considered\nin this chapter but will be treated in Chapter 8.\nNo rolling-element bearing can give unlimited life because\nof the probability of fatigue.\n\nAny structural material subjec-\n\nted to an unlimited succession of repeated or reversed stresses\nwill ultimately fail.\n\nTherefore all ball bearings eventually\n\nsuccumb to fatigue, which is manifested by surface distress in\nthe form of flaking of metallic particles.\n\nIn many cases flak-\n\ning may begin as a crack below the surface that is propagated to\n\n2\n\nthe surface, where it eventually forms a pit or spall.\n\nFatigue\n\nis assumed to have occurred when the first crack or spall is\nobserved on a load-carrying surface.\n\nA design criterion for the\n\nfatigue life of ball bearings is developed in Section 3.5.\nBall bearings can be lubricated satisfactorily with a small\namount of lubricant supplied to the right area within the\nbearing.\n\nSection 3.6 considers the selection of a satisfactory\n\nlubricant, as well as describing systems that provide a constant\nflow of lubricant to the contact.\n\n3.1 Elliptical-Contact Deformation\n\nWhen an elastic solid is subjected to a load, stresses are\nproduced that increase as the load is increased.\n\nThese stresses\n\nare associated with deformations, which are defined by strains.\nUnique relationships exist between stresses and their corresponding strains.\n\nFor elastic solids the stresses are linearly\n\nrelated to the strains, with the constant of proportionality\nbeing an elastic constant that adopts different values for different materials.\n\nThus a simple tensile load applied to a bar\n\nproduces a stress\n\n01\n\nand a strain\n\n\xe2\x82\xac1\' where\n\nLoad\nStress in axial direction\n\xc2\xb01 = Cross-sectional area =\nChange in length\nOriginal length\n\n=\n\nStrain in axial direction\n\n3\n\n(3.1)\n(3.2)\n\nand\n\xc2\xb01\nE = -- = Elastic constant or modulus of elasticity\n\xe2\x82\xac1\n\n(3.3)\n\nAlthough no stress acts transversely to the axial direction,\nthere will nevertheless be dimensional changes in that direction\nsuch that as a bar extends axially, it contracts transversely.\nThe transverse strains\n\n\xe2\x82\xac2\n\n\xe2\x82\xac1\n\nv\n\nby Poisson\'s ratio\n\nare related to the axial strains\nsuch that\n\n(3.4)\nwhere the negative sign means that the transverse strain will be\nof the opposite sign to the axial strain.\n\nThe modulus of elas-\n\nticity and Poisson\'s ratio are two important parameters used to\ndescribe the material in the analysis of contacting solids.\nAs the stresses increase within the material, elastic behavior is replaced by plastic flow, in which the material is\npermanently deformed.\n\nThe stress state at which the transition\n\nfrom elastic to plastic behavior occurs, known as the yield\nstress, has a definite value for a given material at a given\nte~perature.\n\nIn this book elastic behavior alone is considered.\n\n3.1.1 Surface Stresses and Deformation\n\nWhen two elastic solids are brought together under a load,\na contact area develops, the shape and size of which depend on\n\n4\n\nthe applied load t the elastic properties of the materials t and\nthe curvatures of the surfaces.\n\nWhen the two solids shown in\n\nFigure 2.18 have a normal load applied to them t the shape of the\ncontact area is elliptical t with\nthe semiminor axis.\n\na being the semimajor and\n\nb\n\nIt has been common to refer to elliptical\n\ncontacts as point contacts t but since this book deals mainly\nwith loaded contacts t the term elliptical contact is adopted.\nFor the special case where\n\nr ax\n\n= ray and r bx = r byt\n\nthe resulting contact is a circle rather than an ellipse.\nWhere\n\nray and\n\nr by are both infinite, the initial line\n\ncontact develops into a rectangle when load is applied.\nThe contact ellipses obtained with either a radial or a\nthrust load for the ball - inner-race and ball - outer-race\ncontacts in a ball bearing are shown in Figure 3.1.\n\nThis book\n\nis concerned with the conjunctions between solids - with contact\n;\n\nareas ranging from circular to rectangular - and with the\nanalysis of contacts in a ball bearing.\n\nInasmuch as the size\n\nand shape of these contact areas are highly significant to the\nsuccessful operation of ball bearings, it is important to\nunderstand their characteristics.\nHertz (1881) considered the stresses and deformations in\ntwo perfectly smooth t ellipsoidal, contacting elastic solids\nmuch like those shown in Figure 2.18.\n\nHis application of the\n\nclassical theory of elasticity to this problem forms the basis\nof stress calculation for machine elements such as ball and rol-\n\n5\n\nler bearings, gears, sedls, and cams.\n\nThe following assumptions\n\nwere made by Hertz (1881):\n\n(1) The materials are homogeneous and the yield stress is\nnot exceeded.\n(2) No tangential forces are induced between the solids.\n(3) Contact is limited to a small portion of the surface,\n\nsuch that the dimensions of the contact region are small compared with the radii of the ellipsoids.\n(4) The solids are at rest and in equilibrium (steady\nstate) \xe2\x80\xa2\nMaking use of these assumptions, Hertz (1881) was able to\nobtain the following expression for the pressure within the ellipsoidal contact shown in Figure 3.2:\n2\n\np\n\n=\n\nPmax [ 1 -\n\n(~)\n\n-\n\n(~)\n\n2]1/2\n\n(3.5)\n\nIf the pressure is integrated over the contact area, it is found\nthat\n3F\n\nPmax\n\n=\n\n2nab\n\n(3.6)\n\nEquation (3.5) determines the distribution of pressure or compressive stress on the common interface; it is clearly a maximum\nat the center of the contact and decreases to zero at the periphery.\nThe ellipticity parameter k can be written in terms of\nthe semimajor and semiminor axes of the contact ellipse as\n\n6\n\nk\n\na\n\n(3.7)\n\n=b\n\nHarris (1966) has shown that the ellipticity parameter can be\nused to relate the curvature difference expressed in equation\n(2.25) and the elliptic integrals of the first\n\njr\n\nand second\n\nt! kinds as\nJ(k)\n\n=\n\n[2.)\'"- 1(1 + r)] 1/2\n1(1 - r)\n\nJ\n\n(3.8)\n\nwhere\n\n(3.9)\n\n(3.10)\n\nA one-point iteration method that was adopted by Hamrock and\nAnderson (1973) can be used to obtain the ellipticity parameter,\nwhere\n(3.11)\n\nThe iteration process is normally continued until kn+1 differs from kn by less than lx10- 7 \xe2\x80\xa2 Note that the ellipticity parameter is a function of the radii of curvature of the\nsolids only:\nk = f (r\n\nax , r bx\' r ay , r by )\n\n7\n\n(3.12)\n\n\xc2\xb7,\nThat is, as the load increases, the semimajor and semiminor axes\nof the contact ellipse increase proportionately to each other,\nso the ellipticity parameter remains constant.\nThe ellipticity parameter and elliptic integrals of the\nfirst and second kinds are shown in Figure 3.3 for a range of\nthe curvature ratio Ry/Rx\n\nusually encountered in concen-\n\ntrated contacts.\nWhen the ellipicity parameter\nF, Poisson\'s ratio\n\nk, the normal applied load\n\nv, and the modulus of elasticity\n\nE of the\n\ncontacting solids are known, the semimajor and semiminor axes of\nthe contact ellipse and the maximum deformation at the center of\nthe contact can be written from the analysis of Hertz (1881) as\n(3.13)\n\n(3.14)\n\n(3.15)\nwhere\nEl\n\n2\n\n=\n\n1 - v\n\nEa\nIn these equations\n6\n\na and\n\nis proportional to\n\n2\n\na +\n\n2\n\n(3.16)\n\n1 - vb\n\nE\nb\n\nb are proportional to\n\nF1/ 3 and\n\nF2/3.\n\nKnowing the deformation at the center of tne contact and\nthe natural geometrical separation between the solids, equation\n\n8\n\n(2.35), we can write the deformat i on at any poi nt wi thi n the dry\nHertzian contact as\n\no=\n\nS\n\n0 -\n\n(3.17)\n\nThis equation is used in later chapters to define the film\nthickness within the conjunction.\n\n3.1.2 Subsurface Stresses\n\nFatigue cracks usually start at a certain depth below the\nsurface in planes parallel to the direction of rolling.\n\nBecause\n\nof this, special attention must be given to the shear stress\namplitude occurring in this plane.\n\nFurthermore a maximum shear\n\nstress is reached at a certain depth below the surface.\n\nThe\n\nanalysis used by Lundberg and Palmgren (1947) will be used to\ndefine this stress.\nThe stresses are referred to a rectangular coordinate system with its origin at the center of the contact, its z axis\ncoinciding with the interior normal of the body considered, its\nx axis in the direction of rolling, and its y axis in the direction perpendicular to the rolling direction.\nthat follows it is assumed that\n\nIn the analysis\n\ny = o.\n\nFrom Lundberg and Palmgren (1947) the following equations\ncan be written:\n\nT ZX\n\n3F COS 20 sin 0 sin y\n= 2w (a 2tan 2y +

Deformation\n\nThe classical Hertzian solution presented in the previous\nsection requires the calculation of the ellipticity parameter\nk and the complete elliptic integrals of the first and second\nkinds T\n\nand 8.\n\nThis entails finding a solution to a trans-\n\ncendental equation relating; k, Jr. and 8\n\nto the geometry of\n\nthe contacting solids, as expressed in equation (3.8).\n\nThis is\n\nusually accomplished by some iterative numerical procedure, as\ndescribed by Hamrock and Anderson (1973), or with the aid of\ncharts, as shown by Jones (1946).\nBrewe and Hamrock (1977) used a linear regression by the\nmethod of least squares to obtain simplified equations for\n\n~ and G. That is, for given sets of pairs of data, {[k j\n(Ry/Rx)j]\' j\nregression\n\nby\n\n=\n\nk,\n,\n\n1, 2, .. ., n}, a power fit using a linear\nthe method of least squares resulted in the fol-\n\nlowing equation:\nR )0.6360\n\nk = 1.0339 (\n\n<-\n\n11\n\n(3.28)\n\nThe asymptot ic behavior of\n\n~\n\nand F\n\nwas suggesti ve of the\n\nfunctional dependence that\n\n~\n\nand\n\nmight exhi bit.\n\n\xc2\xa7\'\n\nAs a re-\n\nsult a logarithmic and an inverse curve fit were tried for\nand\n\nI.\n\nrespectively.\n\n\xc2\xa7\'\n\nThe following expressions from Brewe and\n\nHamrock (1977) provide an excellent approximation to the rela-\n\nI, F and Ry/Rx:\n\ntionships between\n\n~\xc2\xb77~68\n\n(3.29)\n\n0.6023 ln (Ry/Rx)\n\n(3.30)\n\ntt = 1.0003\n\n+\n\ny\n\n\xc2\xa7\'\n\nVa 1ues of k.\n\n\'1.\n\n= 1.5277\n\nand\n\n+\n\nx\n\nare presented in Table 3.1 and compared\n\n\xc2\xa7\n\nwith the Hamrock and Anderson (1973) 1lJmerically determined values of\n\nk, tt. and !T.\n\nThe agreement is good.\n\nUsing these simplified expressions for I, C, and .\'F and\nequation (3.15) gives the deformation at the center of the contact\n\n(3.31)\nwhere\nK\n\n= 1fKE\n\nI\n\n- )1/2\n\nRrt\n\n(3.32)\n\n( 4.S\xc2\xa73\n\nNote that the load-deflection constant K is a function of the\nball-race geometry and the material properties.\nThe results of comparing 6 with\nTable 3.1.\n\n6\n\nare also shown in\n\nThe agreement is again quite good. Therefore the\n\ndeformation at the center of the contact can be obtained di-\n\n12\n\nrectly from equations (3.28) to (3.32). This valuable approximation eliminates the need to use curve fitting, charts, or numerica 1 method s.\nFigure 3.4 shQws three different degrees of ball-contact\nconformity:\n\na ball on a ball, a ball on a plane, and a ball -\n\nouter ring contact.\n\nTable 3.2 uses this figure to show how the\n\ndegree of conformity affects the contact parameters.\nshows that\n\nTne table\n\nk is not exactly equal to unity for the ball-on-\n\nball and ball-on-plane situations because of the approximation\nrepresented by equation (3.28).\n\nThe diameter of the balls is\n\nthe same throughout, and the material of the solids is steel.\nThe ball - outer-ring contact is representative of a 209 radial\nball bearing.\n\nA 4.45-N (l-lbf) normal load has been considered\n\nfor each situation.\n\nThe maximum pressure decreases signifi-\n\ncantly as the curvature of the mating surface approaches that of\nthe ball.\n\nTable 3.2 shows that the curvature of the mating\n\nsurfaces is very important in relation to the magnitude of the\nmaximum pressure or surface stress produced.\n\nA ball and ring of\n\nhigh conformity are thus desirable from the standpoint of\nminimizing the stress.\nTable 3.2\n\n~lso\n\nshows that the area of the contact\n\nincreases with the conformity of the contacting solids.\n\n~ab\n\nAl-\n\nthough this effect minimizes contact stresses, it can have an\nundesirable effect on the force of friction, since friction\nforGe increases as the contact area and hence the area of the\n\n13\n\nsheared lubricant increase in a bearing operating under\nelastohydrodynamic conditions.\n\nThe curvatures of the bearing\n\nraces are therefore generally compromises that take into\nconsideration the stress, load capacity, and friction\ncharacteristics of the bearing.\nIn equations (3.24) to (3.27) the location and magnitude of\nthe maximum subsurface shear stress are written as functions of\ntat an auxiliary parameter.\n\nFurthermore in equation (3.23)\n\nthe ellipticity parameter is written as a function of\nThe range for\n\n11k\n\nis 0\n\n~\n\n11k\n\n~\n\ntao\n\n1, and the corresponding range\n\nt a is 1 ~ t a ~ (l +V17)/4. A linear regression by\nthe method of least squares was used to obtain a simplified\n\nfor\n\nformula for\n\nt a in terms of\n\nk, the ellipticity parameter.\n\nThat is, for given sets of pairs of data {[(1 - ta)j\'\n(1/k)jJ,\n\nj\n\n=1, 2, \xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2 , n}, a power fit using a linear\n\nregression by the method of least squares resulted in the\nfollowing equation:\n1)1.8559\n\nt a - 1 = 0.3044 ( k\n\n(3.33)\n\nThe agreement between this approximate equation and the exact\nsolution is within *2 percent.\n\nThe use of equation (3.33)\n\ngreatly simplifies the determination of the values for the\nlocation and magnitude of the maximum subsurface shear stress\nexpressed in equations (3.24) to (3.27).\n\n14\n\n3.3 Static Load Distribution\n\nNow that a simple analytical expression for the deformation\nin terms of the load has been determined, it is possible to consider how the bearing load is distributed among the balls within\na ball bearing.\n\nMost ball bearing applications involve steady-\n\nstate rotation of either the inner or outer ring, or both.\n\nIn\n\nanalyzing the load distribution on the balls, it is usually satisfactory to ignore these effects in most applications.\n\nIn this\n\nsection the radial, thrust, and combined load distributions of\nstatically loaded ball bearings are investigated.\nFor a given ball-race contact the load deflection relationship given in equation (3.31) can be rewritten as\n(3.34)\nThe total normal approach between two races separated by a ball\nis the sum of the deformati ons under load between the ball and\nboth races.\n\nTherefore\n6=0\n\no\n\n+0.\n\n1\n\n(3.35)\n\nwhere\n\n=\n\n6\n\no\n\n(L\n\n\\2/3\n\nKo"J\n\n(3.36)\n\n(3.37)\n\n15\n\nSubstituting equations (3.35) to (3.37) into equation (3.34) and\nsolving for K give\n(3.38)\n\nRecall that K;\n\nand K are defined by equation (3.32) and\no\nthat they are a function of ball-race geometry and material\nproperties alone.\nThe analysis of deformation and load distribution presented\nin the following three sections is based on the work of Jones\n\n(1946).\n\n3.3.1 Radial Load\n\nA radially loaded ball bearing with radial clearance Pd\nis shown in Figure 3.5. In the concentric position shown in\nFigure 3.5(a) a uniform radial clearance between the balls and\nthe rings of\n\nPd/2\n\nis evident.\n\nThe application of a small\n\nradial load to the shaft causes the inner ring to move a distance Pd/2 before contact is made between a ball located on\nthe load line and the inner and outer tracks. At any angle\nthere will still be a small radial clearance c that, if\nis small compared with the radius of the tracks, can be expressed with adequate accuracy by\n\n16\n\nPd\n\nOn the load line, where\n\n~\n\n= 0,\n\nthe clearance is zero, but when\n\nW = 90\xc2\xb0 the clearance retains its initial value of Pd/ 2 \xe2\x80\xa2\nThe application of further load will cause elastic deformation of some of the balls and the elimination of clearance\n2~~.\n\naround an arc\n\nIf the interference or total elastic com-\n\npression on the load line is\ncompression\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\no~\n\n0max\' the corresponding elastic\n\nalong a radius at angle\n\n~\n\nto the load line\n\nwill be given by\n6\xe2\x80\xa2. = (omax COS. - c) = (6 max +\n\n:d)\n\nCOS. _\n\n:d\n\nNow it is clear from Figure 3.5(c) that (omax+ Pdf2)\nrepresents the total radial displacement of the inner ring or\nshaft from the concentric position\n\nHence\n\n6.\n\n(3.39)\nThe relationship between load and the elastic compression along\nthe radius at angle\n\n~\n\nto the load vector is given by equation\n\n(3.34) as\n(3.40)\nSubstituting equation (3.3Y) into this equation gives\n{,\n\nFljJ\n\nP\n\n)3/2\n\n= K\\6 co s ~ - 2d\n\n17\n\n(3.41)\n\nFor static equilibrium the applied radial load must equal\nthe sum of the components of the ball loads parallel to the\ndirection of the applied load.\nFr =\nTherefore\n\nFr\n\n=K\n\nL:\n\nI (.\n\nFlji cos 1/J\n\ncos " - : d)3/2\n\nThe angular extent of the bearing arc\n\n21/J 2\n\n(3.42)\n\nCOS"\n\nin which the balls\n\nare loaded is obtained by setting the root expression in (3.42)\nequal to zero and solving for 1/J.\n1/JQ, =\n\ncos\n\n-1 (Pd\\\n76)\n\n(3.43)\n\nThe summation in equation (3.42) applies only to the angular extent of the loaded region.\n\nThis equation can be written\n\nin integral form as\np\n\n-\n\n2~\n\n)3/2\ncos 1/J d1/J\n\n(3.44)\n\nThe integral in this equation can be reduced to a standard elliptic integral by the hypergeometric series and the beta function.\n\nIf the integral is numerically evaluated\n\nfollowing approximate expression is derived:\n\n18\n\ndirectly~\n\nthe\n\n1/JR.\n\n[\n\n,OS\n\np\n1/J -\n\n2~\n\n)3/2\n\ncos\n\nljI\n\n= 2.491\n\ndljl\n\n(3.45)\nThis approximate expression fits the exact numerical solution to\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nwithin %2 percent for a complete range of P /26.\nd\nThe load carried by the most heavily loaded ball is obtained by substituting\n\n~\n\n= 0\xc2\xb0 in equation (3.42) and dropping\n\nthe summation sign.\nFmax\n\np\n\n1- ~\n26\n(\n\n= K6 3/2\n\n)3/2\n\n(3.46)\n\nDividing the maximum ball load (equation (3.46)) by the total\napplied radial load of the bearing (equation (3.44)), rearranging terms, and making use of equation (3.45) give\nFr\n\nnF max\n\n=\n\n(3.47)\n\nZ\n\nwhere\n{,\nw~\n\nZ\n\nd)3/2\n\n-\n\nP\n-26\n\n= --~=--=---~--=-.,.,.,.r--~\n2.491\n\n~\n\n(3.48)\n\n~2\n\nd\n\n1 -p\n1+\xc2\xb7\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2 U\n\n1.23\n\nWhen the diametral clearance Pd is zero, the value of Z becomes 4.37.

Each ball is subjected to an identical\nthrust component FtInt where Ft is the total thrust load.\nThe initial contact angle before the application of a thrust\nload is denoted by Sf.\n\nBecause of the applied thrust t the\n\ncontact angle becomes S.\n\nThe normal ball thrust load Ft\nacts at this contact angle and is written as\n(3.50 )\n\nA cross section through an angular-contact bearing under a thrust\n\nload Ft is shown in Figure 3.7.

Life\n\nBall bearings can fail from numerous causes, including\nfaulty handling and fitting, wear associated with dirt, damage\nto the races or separators, and fatigue.\n\nHowever, if they sur-\n\nvive all the other hazards, ball bearings eventually fail because of fatigue of the bearing material.\n\nFor this reason the\n\nsubject of fatigue calls for special consideration.\n\nFatigue is\n\ncaused by the repeated stresses developed in the contact areas\nbetween the ball and the. races and manifests itself as a fatigue\ncrack starting at or below the surface.\n\nThe fatigue crack pro-\n\npagates until a piece of the race or ball material spalls out\n\n37\n\nand produces the failure.\nFigure 2.24.\n\nA typical fatigue spall is shown in\n\nOn a microscale we can surmise that there will be\n\na wide dispersion in material strength, or resistance to fatigue t because of inhomogeneities in the material.\n\nBearing ma-\n\nterials are complex alloys and are thus neither homogeneous nor\nequally resistant to failure at all points.\n\nTherefore the fa-\n\ntigue process can be expected to be one in which a group of apparently identical ball bearings subjected to identical loads,\nspeeds, lubrication, and environmental conditions exhibit wide\nvariations in failure times.\n\nFor this reason tbe fatigue pro-\n\ncess must be treated statistically.\n\nthat is, the fatigue life\n\nof a bearing is normally defined in terms of its statistical\nability to survive for a certain period of time.\n\n3.5.1 Load Factor\n\nThe predominant factor in determining the fatigue life of a\nball bearing is the load factor.\n\nThe relationship between life\n\nand load developed here is based on a well-lubricated system and\na bearing made of air-melted materials.\n\nTo predict how long a\n\nparticular bearing will run under a specific load, two essential\npieces of information are required:\n(1) An accurate, quantitative estimate of the life\ndispersion or scatter\n\n38\n\n(2) An expression for the dynamic load capacity or\nability of the bearing to endure a given load\nfor a stipulated number of stress cycles or\nrevolutions\nA typical distribution of the fatigue life of identical\nball bearings operating under nominally identical conditions is\npresented in Figure 3.12.\n\nThis figure shows that the number of\n\nrevolutions that a bearing can complete with 100 percent probability of survival, l\';a = 1, is zero.\n\nAlternatively the proba-\n\nbility of any bearing in the population having infinite endur\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nance is zero.\n\nFailure is normally assumed to have occurred when\n\nthe first spall is observed on a load-carrying surface.\nBearing manufacturers have chosen to use one or two points\non the curve in Figure 3.12 to describe bearing endurance:\n(1) The fatigue life that 90 percent of the bearing\npopulation will endure (L\n\n)\n10\n(2) The median life, that is, the life that 50 percent\nof the population will endure (L\n\n)\nSO\nBearing manufacturers almost universally refer to a "rating\nlife" as a measure of the fatigue endurance of a given bearing\noperating under given load conditions.\nthe estimated\n\nThis "rating life" is\n\nL10 fatigue life of a large popu1ation of such\nbeari ngs operating under the \xc2\xb7specified loadi ng.\n\n39\n\nFatigue life is generally stated in millions of revolutions.\n\nAs an alternative it may be and frequently is given in\n\nhours of successful operation at a given speed.\nWeibull (1949) has postulated that the fatigue lives of a\nhomogeneous group of ball bearings are dispersed according to\nthe following relation:\n1\nL\nln ln -- = e ln -A\nsa\n\n(3.113)\n\nwhere\nL = life, millions of revolutions\ne \xe2\x80\xa2 dispersion exponent (slope of Weibull plot) or measure of\nscatter in bearing lives\nA = constant, such that\n\ne In A is vertical intercept on\n\nWeibull plot when L = 1\nThe fatigue life L in equation (3.113) is the\n\nL\nlife,\n10\nbut it is simply referred to here and throughout the remainder\nof the book as fatigue life L.\nThe so-called Weibull distribution given in equation\n\n(3:113) results from a statistical theory of strength based on\nthe theory of probability, where the dependence of strength on\nvolume is explained by the dispersion in material strength.\nThis is the "weakest link" theory.\n\nEquation (3.113) is used for\n\nplotting fatigue failures to determine the\n\nL\nlives. A\n10\ntypical Weibull plot of bearing fatigue failures is given in\nFigure 3.13.\n\nThe experimental results shown as circular points\n\n40\n\nin this figure confirm that bearing lives conform well with the\nWeibull distribution and that the bearing fatigue data will plot\nas a straight line.\nWith a technique for treating life dispersion now available, an expression for the dynamic load capacity that a bearing\ncan carry for a given number of stress cycles with a given probability of survival must be derived.\n\nFrom the weakest-link\n\ntheory we get the relationship between the life of an assembly\n(the bearing) and its components (the inner and outer rings):\n(3.114)\n\nFor ball bearings\n\ne = 10/9.\n\nThe following expression can be\n\nwritten for the fatigue life of elliptical contacts\n(3.115)\nwhere\nF = static load capacity\nC = dynamic load capacity\nUsing this equation and changing the fatigue life from millions\nof revolutions to hours of successful operation at a given\nspeed, we can write equation (3.114) as\n(3.116)\n\n41\n\nThe static loads Fi and Fo can be obtained from either\nSection 3.3 or 3.4 for the appropriate load and speed condition.\n\nIn equation (3.116) N is expressed in revolutions per\n\nminute, and the fatigue life is expressed in hours of successful\noperation at the given speed\n\nN.\n\nFrom Lundberg and Palmgren (1947) the dynamic load capacity\nof the inner ring can be written as\nC.\n\n= 84,000\n\n1\n\nT )3.l(<Il.)0.4(21.R .)2.1\n1\n_1\n1 1\n(\n<Ill\n1r\n\nTi"\n\nk~\xc2\xb7 7\n1\n\nP\n\n(u. ) -1/3\n\n(3.H7)\n\n1\n\n1\n\nwhere\nT i -\n\n(\n\n\xc2\xb0\n\nT\'\n_ .)\nPmax i\n\nTO)\n-1 - ( Pmax\n\nT -\n\nk=1\n\nTO = maximum orthogonal subsurface shear stress\n<Il i\n\n= ratio of depth of maximum shear stress of inner ring to\nsemiminor axis of contact ellipse, zO/b\n\n<Ill = (q\xc2\xbb k=l\nu. = number of stress cycles per revolution of inner ring\n1\n\nWi th proper changing of subscripts from\n\nto o. equation\n\n(3.117) can represent the dynamic load capacity of the outer\nring\n\nCo.\nThe number of stress cycles per revolution U denotes the\n\nnumber of balls that pass a given point (under load) on the race\n\n42\n\nof one ring while the other ring has turned through one complete\nrevolution.\n\nTherefore the number of balls passing a point on\n\nthe inner ring per unit of time is\nn\nui = 7dT (d\'\ne\ne\n\ncos 6i )\n\n(3.118)\n\nuo\n.\n\n.\n\n+ d\n\n- d cos 60 )\n\n(3.119)\n\nn\ne\n\n= ~ (d~\n\nIn equation (3.117) the diameters of the inner and outer\nraces are written as\nd. = d\' - d cos\n1\ne\n\n6.\n\n(3.120)\n\nd = d\'\ne\n0\n\n6\n\n(3.121)\n\n+ d\n\ncos\n\n1\n\n0\n\nHamrock and Anderson (1973) found that for most ball bearing configurations the variation of T and\n\n~\n\nis such that the\n\nfollowing approximation can be made:\n(3.122)\nTable 3.3 presents corresponding values for\n\n11k, T, and\n\n~,\n\nas\n\nwell as values of (TI/T)3.1(~/~1)0.4 for corresponding\nvalues of\n\n11k.

(1974) for a 20-mm-bore ball bearing\noperating at 120,000 rpm.\n\nNote that an increase in outer-race\n\ncurvature brings about a substantial decrease in fatigue life.\nOn the other hand an increase in inner-race curvature does not\n\n.\n\naffect the life to any appreciable degree.\n\nThe reason for this\n\nis that at high speeds the centrifugal force acts against the\nouter race.\n\nIt is thus important in optimizing the bearing life\n\nin high-speed applications that the outer-race conformity ratio\nshould remain as low as possible.\ncurvature ratio f\n\nConformity expressed by a\n\nof 0.515 to 0.520 represents the lowest\n\nthreshold of present manufacturing practices.\nThe contact angle in ball bearings is extremely important\ninasmuch as it critically affects the bearing stiffness and\nlife.\n\nTypical variations of fatigue life with initial contact\n\naf for a medium-size bearing operating at a value of dbN\nof 1.5 million are shown in Figure 3.15. The contact-angle range\nangle\n\nsuggested in Figure 3.15 is typical of bearings operating at high\nspeed s.\nIn recent years better understanding of ball bearing design, materials, processing, and lubrication has permitted an\nimprovement in bearing performance.\n\nThis is reflected in either\n\nhigher bearing reliability or longer expected lives than those\nobtained from equation (3.116) or ball bearing catalogs.\n\n45\n\nAs a\n\nresult Bamberger, et ale (1971) arrived at an expression for the\nadjusted bearing fatigue life\n\nLa = DEFGL\n\n(3.124)\n\nwhere\n\n0=\n\nmaterial factor\n\n-\n\nE = processing factor\n-,\n\nF :\' lubrication factor\n\nG:=\nr\n\nhardness factor\n\nThe next three sections deal with these factors.\n\n3.5.2 Lubrication Factor\n\nIf a ball bearing is adequately designed and lUbricated,\nthe rolling surfaces can be separated by a lubricant film.\n\nEn-\n\ndurance testing of bearings, as reported by Tallian, et al.\n(1965), has demonstrated that when the lubricant film is thick\nenough to separate the two contacting bodies, fatigue life of\nthe bearing is greatly extended.\n\nConversely, when the film is\n\nnot thick enough to provide full separation between tne asperities in the contact zone, the life of the bearing is adversely\naffected by the high shear resulting from direct metal-to-metal\ncontact.\n\nAn expression for the film thickness in ball bearings\n\nis developed later, but it is convenient to illustrate its\neffect on fatigue life in this section.\n\n46\n\nTo establish the effect of film thickness on the life of\nany given bearing, we first calculate the film parameter A.\nThe relationship between A and the film thickness\n\nh is\n\nh\n\nA=\n\n(3.125)\n\n(f2 + f2)1l2\n. r\n\nb\n\nwhere\nf r = rms surface finish of race\nf b = rms surface finish of ball\nA more detailed discussion of surface topography is given in\nSection 4.1, and the rms is defined by equation (4.2).\nWith the film parameter A known, Figure 3.16 can be used\nto determine the lubrication factor\n\nF.\n\nNote from\n\n~his\n\nfigure\n\nthat when the film parameter values fall below approximately\n1.2, the bearing fatigue life is adversely affected since F is\nless than -1.\n\nConversely, when the v\xc2\xb73.bes of A are between 1.2\n\nand 3, bearing fatigue life is appreciably extended.\n\nFilm pa-\n\nrameters higher than 3 do not yield any further improvement in\nthe lubrication factor\n\nF mainly because at these values of\n\nA\n\nthe lubricant film is thick enough to separate the extreme peaks\nof the interacting surfaces.\n\n3.5.3 Material Factor\n\nBamberger, et ale (1971) have shown that bearing materials\ncan significantly affect the ultimate performance of a bearing.\n\n47\n\nAs mentioned in Chapter 2 the most frequently used steel for\nball bearings is AISI 52100.\n\nThe dynamic load capacity, as cal-\n\nculated from equation (3.117) or any bearing manufacturer\'s catalog, is based on air-melted 52100 steel that has been hardened\nto 58 Rockwell C (R c ). Because of improvements in the quality\nof air-melted steels, Bamberger, et ale (1971) suggested the\nvalue of the material factor\n\n0 shown in Table 3.5.\n\nFactors\n\ntaking into account vacuum remelting, hardness, and other processing variables are considered separately.\n\nMany of the mater-\n\nials in this table were discussed in Section 2.4, and the chemical compositions of many of these steels are given in Tahle 2.1.\n\n3.5.4 Processing Factors\n\nImprovements in processing techniques have also extended\nfatigue life.\n\nThe various melting practices have been dis-\n\ncussed in Section 2.4.1.\n\nZaretsky, et al. (1969) found that\n\nconsumable-electrode vacuum remelting (CVM) gave up to 13 times\nlonger life than air melting.\n\nHowever, Bamberger, et al. (1971)\n\nrecommended that a processing factor \'E of 3 be used for all\nCVM bearing steels.\n\nThis value may be somewhat conservative,\n\nbut the confidence factor for achieving this level of improvement is high.\nAnother processing factor that seriously affects bearing\nfatigue life is material hardness.\n\n48\n\nThe minimum recommended\n\nhardness for ball bearing steels is 5B K. A drop in hardness\nc\nfrom that value because of either poor heat treatment or high\noperating temperatures will appreciably shorten the bearing fatigue life, as pointed out by Bamberger, et ale (1971).\n\nTo\n\nenable an estimate to be made of the effects of hardness change\n\n-\n\non beari ng 1ife, a hardness factor G is defined as\n\n__ (R c)1O\xc2\xb78\n\nGwhere\nial.\n\n58\n\n(3.126)\n\nR is the operational hardness of the bearing materc\nNote that the relationship presented by equation (3.126)\n\nindicates that bearing life is highly sensitive to changes in\nhardness.\n\nThus, for example, a two-point drop in hardness to\n\n56 R will cause a 32 percent drop in bearing fatigue life.\nc\nOnce the various factors in equation (3.124) have been defined, the adjusted fatigue life La can be calculuted from\nthat equation.\n\nThis equation enables the designer to arrive at\n\na more realistic estimate of bearing fatigue life.\n\n3.6 Bearing Lubrication\n\nWithout adequate lubrication of the ball-race conjunction,\nvarious degrees of damage will result to the rolling\nthe races, or both.\n\nelerr~nts\n\nor\n\nThese include the development of scuffing,\n\nplastic flow, and pitting.\n\nThe fatigue life of tne ball-race\n\n49\n\ncontact therefore depends on this conjunction having an adequate\nlubricant film, as pointed out in the previous section.\nFor many years the opinion prevailed that the maximum contact pressure in the ball-race contact precluded the possibility\nof a lubricant film existing in the conjunction.\n\nHowever, it is\n\nnow generally accepted not only that a lubricant film is present, but also that the nature of the lubricant fi 1m has an important influence on the fatigue life of the bearing.\n\nBesides\n\nproviding a film, the lubricant in a ball bearing must provide\ncorrosion protection and act as a coolant.\nNot only the ball-race contact but also all the interfaces\nbetween moving elements must be properly lubricated.\n\nThe ball-\n\nseparator and race-separator contacts experience mostly impact\nloading and therefore have greater possibilities of metal-tometal contact, even when the bearing has an adequate supply of\nlubricant.\n\nFor this reason the separator surfaces are generally\n\ncoated with a low-friction material.\nThe ball-race contacts in ball bearings can generally be\nsatisfactorily lubricated with a small amount of appropriate\nlubricant supplied to the right area within the bearing.\n\nThe\n\nmajor considerations in proper ball bearing lubrication are\n\n(1) Selection of a suitable lubricant\n(2) Selection of a system that will provide an adequate\nand constant flow of this lubricant to the contact\nThese two topics are considered in the following sections.\n\n50\n\n3.6.1 Lubricants\n\nBoth oils and greases are extensively used as lubricants\nfor all types of ball bearings over a wide range of speeds and\noperating temperatures.\n\nThe choice is frequently determined by\n\nconsiderations other than lubrication requirements alone.\nBecause of its fluidity oil has a number of advantages over\ngrease:\n\nIt can enter the loaded conjunction most readily to\n\nflush away contaminants, such as water and dirt, and particularly to transfer heat from heavi ly loaded beari ngs.\n\nIt is also\n\nfrequently advantageous to lubricate bearings from a central oil\nsystem used for other machine parts.\nGrease, however, is extensively used because it permits\nsimplified designs of housings and bearing enclosures, which\nrequire less maintenance, and because it is more effective in\nsealing against dirt and contaminants.\n\nIt also reduces possible\n\ndamage to the process or product from oil leakage.\n\nOi 1 Lubrication\n\nExcept for a few special requirements petroleum oils satisfy most operating conditions.\n\nHigh-quality products, free\n\nfrom adulterants that can have an abrasive or lapping action,\nare recommended.\n\nAnimal or vegetable oils or petroleum oils of\n\npoor quality tend to oxidize, to develop acids, and to form\n\n51\n\nsludge or resinlike deposits on the bearing surfaces.\n\nThey thus\n\npenalize bearing performance or endurance.\nA composite of recommended lubricant viscosities at 38\n\n0\n\nC\n\n(100\xc2\xb0 F) is shown as Figure 3.17.\n\nIn many ball bearing applica2\ntions an oil equivalent to an SAE-lO motor oil (40xlO- 6 m /s, or\n40 cS, at 38\xc2\xb0 C (100\xc2\xb0 F)) or a light turbine oil is the most\nfrequent choice.\nFor a number of military applications where the operational requirements span the temperature range _54\xc2\xb0 to 204\xc2\xb0 C\n(_65\xc2\xb0 to 400\n\n0\n\nF), synthetic oils are used.\n\nEster lubricants are\n\nmost frequently employed in this temperature range.\n\nIn applica-\n\ntions where temperatures exceed 260\xc2\xb0 C (500\xc2\xb0 F), most synthetics\nwill quickly break down, and either a solid lubricant (e.g.,\nMOS 2 ) or a polyphenyl ether is recommended.\n\nA more detailed\n\ndiscussion of synthetic lubricants can be found in Bisson and\nAnderson (1964).\n\nGrease Lubrication\n\nThe simplest method of lubricating a bearing is to apply\ngrease, because of its relatively nonfluid characteristics.\nDanger of leakage is reduced, and the housing and enclosure design can be simpler and less costly than those used with oil.\nGrease can be packed into bearings and retained with inexpensive\n\n52\n\nclosures, but packing should not be excessive and the manufacturer\'s recommendations should be closely adhered to.\nThe major limitation of grease lubrication is that it is\nnot particularly useful in high-speed applications.\n\nIn general\n\nit is not employed for speed factors (dbN, bore in millimeters\ntimes speed in revolutions per minute) over 200,000 although\nselected greases have been used successfully for higher speed\nfactors with specially designed ball bearings .\n. Greases vary widely in properties, depending on the type\nand grade or consistency.\nmendations can be made.\n\nFor this reason few specific recomGreases used for most bearing operating\ndiester~ polyester~\n\nconditions consist of petroleum,\n\nor silicone\n\noils thickened with sodium or lithium soaps or with more recently developed nonsoap thickeners.\n\nGeneral characteristics of\n\ngreases are as follows:\n(1) Petroleum oil greases are best for general-purpose operation from _34\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\nto 149 C (_30 to 300 F).\n\n(2) Diester oil greases are designed for low-temperature\nservice down to _54\n\n0\n\nC (_65\n\n0\n\nF).\n\n(3) Ester-based greases are similar to diester oil greases\nbut have better high-temperature characteristics, covering a\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\nrange from _73 to 177 C (_100 to 350 F).\n(4) Silicone oil greases are used for both high- and lowtemperature operation, over the widest temperature range of all\n\n53\n\ngreases (_73\n\n0\n\nto 232\n\n0\n\nC; _100\n\n0\n\nto 450\n\n0\n\nF), but have the disad-\n\nvantage of low load-carrying capacity.\n(5) Fluorosilicone oil greases have all the desirable features of silicone oil greases plus good load-carrying capacity\nand resistance to fuels, solvents, and corrosive substances.\nThey have a very low volatility in vacuums down to 10- 7 torr,\nwhich makes them useful in aerospace applications.\n(6) Perfluorinated oil greases have a high degree of chemical inertness and are completely nonflammable.\n\nThey have good\n\nload-carrying capacity and can operate at temperatures as high\n0\n\nas 288 C (550\n\n0\n\nF) for long periods, which makes them useful in\n\nthe chemical process and aerospace industries, where high reliability justifies the additional cost.\nGrease consistency is important since grease will slump\nbadly and churn excessively when too soft and fail to lubricate\nwhen too hard.\n\nEither condition causes improper lubrication,\n\nexcessive temperature rise, and poor performance and can shorten\nbeari ng 1ife.\nA valuable guide to the estimation of the useful life of\ngrease in rolling-element bearings has been published by the\nEngineering Sciences Data Unit (1978).\nIt has been demonstrated recently by Aihara and Dowson\n(1979) and by Wilson (1979) that the film thickness in greaselubricated components can be calculated with adequate accuracy\nby using the Viscosity of the base oil in the\n\n54\n\nelastohyd~odynamic\n\nequations (see Chapter 8).\n\nAihara and Dowson compared film\n\nthickness measurements made by capacitance techniques on a\ngrease-lubricated, two-disc machine with the predictions of\nelastohydrodynamic theory.\n\nWilson reported an extensive and\n\nimpressive range of experiments on a grease-lubricated roller\nbearing.\n\nThis work enables the elastohydrodynamic theory de-\n\nveloped in this text to be applied with confidence to greaselubricated ball bearings.\n\n3.6.2 Lubrication Systems\n\nThe quantity of lubricant required to maintain adequate\nlubrication of ball bearings is small.\n\nData presented by\n\nWilcock and Booser (1957) show that for medium-size, deep-groove\nball bearings operating at moderate loads and speeds (2.16xl0 6 .\ndbN), the quantity of oil required is about 0.5 mg/hr.\n\nThe\n\noil requirement is determined by the severity of the operating\ncondit ions.\nSome of the techniques most frequently used to lubricate a\nball bearing are described in tne following paragraphs.\n\nForced Lubrication\n\nAlthough the quantity of oil required to provide adequate\nlubrication is small, it is frequently desirable in heavily\n\n55\n\nloaded, high-speed bearings to use the oil to transfer heat away\nfrom the bearing.\n\nIn such cases a circulating lubrication sys-\n\ntem is employed in which a pump delivers the lubricant oil to\njets directed into the bearing and suitable drains return it to\nthe reservoir.\n\nGravity discharge can be used in systems where\n\nthe pressure drop across the oil return lines is small.\n\nCare\n\nmust be taken to ensure that no oil accumulates directly within\nthe bearing area since submergence of the bearing in oil will\ncause excessive churning and result in high temperatures within\nthe lubricating system.\n\nTo avoid oil accumulation within the\n\nbearing cavities, scavenge pumps are frequently used.\n\nThe scav-\n\nenge pump provides the pressure differential necessary to evacuate the oil from the bearing cavity.\n\nMist Lubrication\n\nAt extremely high speeds, where any appreciable quantity of\noil present in the bearings would cause an intolerable power\nloss due to oil churning, oil-mist lubrication is necessary.\nSmall-bore bearings that operate at speeds of 50,000 to about\n100,000 rpm are usually lubricated by means of an oil mist.\n\nIn\n\noil-mist systems the stream,of atomized oil is generally directed against the inner race of the bearing, which is the most\ndifficult to lubricate because of the effect of centrifugal\nforce on the oil.\n\nAir pressures of 100 to 200 N/m 2 and nozzle\n\n56\n\ndiameters of O.8xlO- 3 to 1.3xlO- 3 m are used.\n\nBecause the\n\ncompressed air must be free from moisture, it is customary to\ninstall a drier in the air line.\nOil-mist systems are noncirculating:\n\nThe oil is passed\n\nthrough the bearing once and then discarded.\n\nExtremely low oil\n\nflow rates are required for lubrication, exclusive of cooling.\nSince the required rates are so low, a nominal-capacity sump is\nadequate for supplying a multiple-bearing system for an extended\ntime.\n\nSplash Lubrication\n\nSplash-feed lubrication systems are employed in low-speed\nmachinery such as some gearboxes.\n\nIn these systems oil is per-\n\nmitted to accumulate within the bearing cavities and is delivered direct ly to the beari ng either by the immers i on of the\nbearing separator and balls in the oil or through the use of an\noil ring.\n\nOil rings are mainly used in horizontally mounted\n\nmachines.\n\nThe loose-fitting ring, whose diameter is consider-\n\nably larger than that of the shaft, dips into the lubricant reservoir beneath the bearing and carries oil to the top of the\nshaft by a viscous lifting process.\n\n57\n\nWick Lubrication\n\nWick-feed systems are used either in low-speed machinery or\nin gyro and momentum wheel applications.\n\nIn both cases the\n\nbearing cavity is packed with either felt or a porous plastic\ncapable of providing a lubricant reservoir.\n\nBoth the felt and\n\nthe porous plastic hold oil by capillary forces.\n\nA wick bridg-\n\ning the oil reservoir supplies the required quantity of lubricant to the bearing.\nIn some designs the reservoir is located above the bearing\nto make use of gravity flow in the wick.\n\nCare must be taken to\n\nadjust the wick so that a very light contact is made with the\nslinger, or the wick may be charred.\n\nseparator Lubrication\n\nSeparator lubrication systems are used mainly in instrument\nbearings, where the bearings are not readily accessible for relubrication and the system \'is sensitive to torque perturbations.\n\nCotton-base phenolic separators have been most fre-\n\nquently used (as pointed out in Section 2.5).\n\nThe separators\n\nare impregnated with either mineral or synthetic oils.\n\nDuring\n\noperation the lubricant is transferred from the separator onto\nthe ball and hence reaches the ball-race contact.\n\n58\n\nseparator lubrication systems offer the advantages of compactness and relatively low torque variation.\n\nTheir disadvan-\n\ntages include difficulties encountered in lubricant distribution\nand retention that result in premature failure.\n\nBecause sepa-\n\nrator-impregnated bearings also have low heat-removal capability, they severely limit the maximum permissible operating\nspeed s.\n\nDry Lubri cation\n\nDry lubrication is mainly employed for high-temperature or\ncryogenic operations where known liquid luby\'icants lose their\nliquidity and/or are subject to chemical changes such as excessive oxidation.\n\nThe most common dry lubricants have a base of\n\nmolybdenum disulfide (MOS 2 ), polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE),\nor carbon powder. Materials combining an three dry lubricants\nare also available.\n\nThe lubricant is applied to metallic sepa-\n\nrators as a coating or is incorporated into the cage material.\nLubricant is transferred from the cage onto the ball-race contacts as in the case of separator-impregnated lubrication, by\nthe ball sliding against the cage pocket wall and transferring\nthe lubricant into the ball-race contact area (e.g., Brewe,\net al., 1969).\nDry-lubricated bearings often have relatively high wear\nrates, which limit their useful life.\n\n59\n\nBecause of this limita-\n\ntion such bearings are generally employed only in applications\nwhere conventional lubricants become incapable of meeting the\nharsh operating requirements.\n\n3.7 Closure\n\nIn this chapter load-deflection relationships have been\ndeveloped for any type of elliptical contact.\n\nThe deformation\n\nwithin the contact is a function, among other things, of the\nellipticity parameter and the elliptic integrals of the first\nand second kinds.\n\nSimplified expressions have been written in\n\nSection 3.2 that allow deformation to be calculated quickly, and\ngenerally with adequate accuracy.\nThe methods developed in Section 3.3 to calculate the distribution of load among the balls in a complete bearing can be\nused in most applications because rotational speeds are usually\nslow to moderate.\n\nUnder these conditions the effects of ball\n\ncentrifugal forces and gyroscopic moments are negligible.\n\nAt\n\nhigh rotational speeds these body forces become significant and\ntend to alter contact angles and clearances.\n\nThey can thus\n\ngreatly affect the static load distribution.\n\nThe effect of\n\nthese parameters on high-speed-bearing load distribution has\nbeen discussed in Section 3.4.\nBall bearings can fail from a number of causes; but if all\nother hazards are avoided, they will eventually fail because of\n\n60\n\nmaterial fatigue.\n\nThe fatigue life of a bearing is normally\n\ndefined in terms of its statistical ability to survive for a\ncertain time.\n\nThe predominant factor in determining the fatigue\n\nlife of a ball bearing is the dynamic load factor.\n\nIn Section\n\n3.5 this factor has been discussed and combined with expressions\nfor the static load capacity from previous sections to enable\nthe fatigue life of a ball bearing to be evaluated.\n\nIn that\n\nsection material, processing, and lubrication factors were also\nintroduced in an adjusted fatigue life expression that greatly\nimproves prediction of ball bearing performance.\nBall bearings can be satisfactorily lubricated with a small\namount of an appropriate lubricant supplied to the rignt area\nwithin the bearing.\n\nThe selection of an appropriate lubricant\n\nand the lubrication systems that provide a constant flow of lubricant to the contact have been discussed in Section 3.6.\n\n61\n\nSYMBOLS\nconstant used in equation (3.113)\n\nA\nA* , B*,\n\nC*\'}\n\nrelaxation coefficients\n\nD*, L* , M*\n2\ndrag area of .ball, m\n\nAv\na\n\nsemimajor axis of contact ellipse, m\n\na\n\na/2m\n\nB\n\ntotal conformity of bearing\n\nb\n\nsemiminor axis of contact ellipse, m\n. b/2m\n\nb\nC\n\ndynamic load capacity, N\n\nCv\n\ndrag coefficient\n\nC1 ,\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7\xc2\xb7,C 8\n\nconstants\n\nc\n\n19,609 N/cm2 (28,440 lbf/in 2 )\n\nc\n\nnumber of equal divisions of semimajor axis\n\nD\n\n-\n\ndistance between race curvature centers, m\n\n0\n\nmaterial factor\n\nD\n\ndefined by equation (5.63)\n\nDe\n\nDeborah number\n\nd\n\nball diameter, m\n\nd\n\nnumber of divisions in semiminor axis\n\nd\n\na\n\noverall diameter of bearing (Figure 2.13), m\n\ndb\n\nbore diameter, m\n\nd\ne\nd\'\ne\n\npitch diameter, m\n\ndi\n\ninner-race diameter, m\n\ndo\n\nouter-race diameter, m\n\npitch diameter after dynamic effects have acted on ball, m\n\n62\n\nE\n\nmodulus of elasticity, N/m2\n\nEI\n\neffective elastic modulus,\n2\ninternal energy, m /s 2\nprocessing factor\nelliptic integral of second kind with modulus (1 - 1/k 2 )\n\n1/2\n\napproximate elliptic integral of second kind\ne\n\ndispersion exponent\n\nF\n\nnormal applied load, N\n\nF*\n\nnormal applied load per unit length, N/m\n\n...,\n\nF\n\nlubrication factor\n\nF\n\nintegrated normal applied load, N\ncentrifugal force, N\nmaximum normal applied load (at\n\n1jJ =\n\n0), N\n\napplied radial load, N\napplied thrust load, N\nnormal applied load at angle\n\n1jJ,\n\nN\n\nelliptic integral of first kind with modulus (1\napproximate elliptic integral of first kind\nrace conformity ratio\nrms surface finish of ball, m\nrms surface finish of race, m\n\nG*\n\ndimensionless materials parameter, aE\nfluid shear modulus, N/m2\nhardness factor\n\ng\n\ngravitational constant, m/s 2\n63\n\n_\n\n1/k\n\n2)1/2\n\n8/3\ndimensionless elasticity parameter, W /U 2\ndimensionless viscosity parameter, GW 3/U 2\n\n....\n\nH\n\ndimensionless film thickness, h/R x\ndimensionless film thickness, H(W/U)2 = F2h/u2n6R~\ndimensionless central film thickness, hc/Rx\ndimensionless central film thickness for starved\nlubrication condition\nfrictional heat, N m/s\ndimensionless minimum film thickness obtained from EHL\nelliptical-contact theory\n\nH.\nmln,r\n\ndimensionless minimum film thickness for a rectangular\ncontact\n\nH.\nmln,s\n\ndimensionless minimum film thickness for starved\nlubrication condition\ndimensionless central film thickness obtained from\nleast-squares fit of data\ndimensionless minimum film thickness obtained from\nleast-squares fit of data\n\nH.\nmln\n\ndimensionless central-film-thickness - speed parameter,\nH U-O\xe2\x80\xa25\nc\ndimensionless minimum-film-thickness - speed parameter,\nH .

Abstract\n\nLoad-deflection relationships for different types of elliptical contacts, such as those found in a\nball bearing are developed. Simplified expressions that allow quick calculations of deformation\nto be made simply from a knowledge of the applied load, the material properties, and the geometry of the contacting elements are presented. Ball bearings subjected to radial, thrust, and\ncombined ball loads are analyzed. A design criterion for fatigue life of ball bearings is developed\nThe selection of a satisfactory lubricant, as well as describing systems that provide a constant\nflow of lUb!icant to the contact, is considered.\n\n17.
