The first two flights will serve to verify the Spacelab systems and will be followed by operational status, including the fifth flight, which will be a reimbursible venture. Scientific investigations in the fields of atmospheric physics and environmental observation, space plasma physics, astronomy and solar physics, materials processing, and life sciences will be performed using the habitable long module, instrument pallets, and/or an instrument igloo mounted in the payload bay. Instrumentation, such as the imaging spectrometric observatory, which was developed in the U.S., will originate in either the U.S. or Europe. Details of the first four Spacelab flights are presented, noting that the OSS-3 through -7 missions will feature the first time that entire NASA payloads have returned to space.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"submissionId": 19820054265, "endDate": "1982-03-19T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Astronautical Society and Deutsche Gesellschaft fuer Luft- und Raumfahrt"}}, "meetingId": "5ac897e2b30e4f9b8715e9496c9a1439", "id": "55b9b10ed0ab465fb71a051519b21758"}], "name": "Goddard Memorial Symposium on Spacelab, Space Platforms and the Future", "location": "Greenbelt, MD", "id": "5ac897e2b30e4f9b8715e9496c9a1439", "startDate": "1982-03-17T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 19820054265, "id": "c0ddc10865d144b8a96bc2d1d1fcfb91", "publicationDate": "1982-03-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
