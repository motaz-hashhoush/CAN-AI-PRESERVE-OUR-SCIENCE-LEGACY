This knowledge of chemical composition,\nmorphology, mineralogy, and isotopics of particles\ncannot be provided by remote sensing. In order to\nacquire these detail information in the laboratories,\nthe samples need be intact, unmelted. Such intact\ncapture of hypervelocity particles has been developed\nin 1996[1].\nSubsequently silica aerogel was\nintroduced as the preferred medium for intact\ncapturing of hypervelocity particles [2] and later\nshowed it to be particularly suitable for the space\nenvironment [3]. STARDUST, the 4th NASA\nDiscovery mission to capture samples from 81P/Wild\n2 and contemporary interstellar dust, is the\nculmination of these new technologies [4].\nIn early laboratory experiments of launching\nhypervelocity projectiles into aerogel, there was the\nneed to cut aerogel to isolate or extract captured\nparticles/tracks [5]. This is especially challenging for\nspace captures, since there will be many\nparticles/tracks of wide ranging scales closely\nlocated, even collocated. It is critical to isolate and\nextract one particle without compromising its\nneighbors since the full significance of a particle is\nnot known until it is extracted and analyzed. To\ndate, three basic techniques have been explored:\nmechanical cutting, lasers cutting and ion beam\nmilling. We report the current findings.\nCutting Requirements: The evaluation criteria\nof cutting aerogel for the processing of captured\nparticles include the following:\n1), amount of contamination/damage to the\nsample or its neighbors.\n2), extent of alteration to the aerogel medium, i.e.,\nswath width.\n3), degree of optical clarity preservation.\n4), processing speed/complexity.\nThe surface condition of silica aerogel can be\ngrouped into three categories: optical, clear and\nobscured. A cleaved silica aerogel surface is near\noptical quality; however cleaving silica aerogel is a\nrandom process. A good casting will produce very\ngood clear quality surface allowing clear optical\nviewing.\nLastly, mechanical processed aerogel\nusually results in optically obscurity along with\nconsiderable shedding of silica grains.\n\nMechanicals: The techniques to physically\ndisrupt the aerogel lattice to cause separations are\nmany: wire diamond saw, blade saw, vibrating\ndisruption and perforation. Table 1 shows the\ntradeoffs of various mechanical techniques.\nWire saw\nContamin.\n\nBlade saw\n\nVibration\n\nPerforation\n\ndiamonds\n\nlittle\n\nlittle\n\nlittle\n\nAlteration\n\nmms\n\nblade width\n\ntool width\n\ntool diameter\n\nVisibility\n\nobscured\n\nobscured\n\nobscured\n\nobscured\n\nSpeed\n\n10s minutes\n\nseconds\n\n10s minutes\n\nhours\n\nThe cut path of wire saw tends to wobble and the\nup and down wire motion makes holding aerogel a\nchallenge, worst if the aerogel piece is small or\nirregular; furthermore, impregnated diamonds and\nwire shreds do come off. Flat blades cut aerogel very\nwell and fast but can cause severe shatter of aerogel\nin mishaps. Vibrating blade or core works well for\nmm paths but would not work well for cm depths.\nKeystoning has proven to work very well for small\nnear the surface particles [6]. Manual cutting with a\nblade produce the best visible surface by cleavage,\nbut without reliable control of the direction of\ncleavages. To date, cutting STARDUST\xe2\x80\x99s 2x4x3 cm\ncells safely and controllably is still a challenge.\nLasers: The primary motivation in using laser to\ncut aerogel was to achieve vaporization. First, 200 W\ncontinuous CO2 laser was used; the cut was easy and\nfast but also produced large amounts of molten glass\nand obscured cut surface. Then we shortened the\nlaser wave lengths to UV; total vaporization was not\nachieved but with smaller molten glass beads. We\nthen went to pulsed femtosecond laser hoping to\ndeliver high power but melting still took place.\nCW CO2\nContamination\n\nUV\n\nPulsed\n\nmelts, coloration\n\nlittle\n\nlittle\n\nAlteration\n\nMany mms\n\n10s \xc2\xb5m\n\n10s \xc2\xb5m\n\nVisibility\n\nobscured\n\nobscured\n\nobscured\n\nSpeed\n\nseconds\n\nminutes\n\n10s minutes\n\nLasers can make coarse cuts over large cm\ndimensions so long as the surface damage will not\naffect the near by samples.\nIons: Then ionization was thought be used to\nadvantage in achieving aerogel vaporization.\nAerogel can be ion milled, but ion milling requires\nsurface preparation such as discharge coating. The\nequipment is sophisticated, and aerogel has to be in a\nvacuum chamber.\nOur test showed that the\npenetration depth is very limited and the resultant\n\nLunar and Planetary Science XXXVI (2005)\n\nsurface is still obscured. The speed of cut can be\nvery slow. An example of ion milling is shown in\nFigure 1.\nConclusion: Specific techniques for specific\nobjectives in aerogel cutting have been demonstrated.\nIt is likely that different techniques will be used for\ncutting STARDUST aerogel cells. Total vaporization\nof aerogel by laser has not been achieved to date. To\nsafely cut STARDUST\xe2\x80\x99s 2x4x3 cm cells while\nleaving a clear surface is still a challenge to be\nrealized.\nUndoubtedly, if an aerogel polishing\ntechnique is developed, cutting aerogel with precious\nembedded particles can be made more routine.\nReferences: [1] Tsou P., et al., (1986) LPI Tech.\nReport 85-805, [2], Tsou P., et al., (1988) LPSC 19th\n[3] Tsou, P.
