OSTA PARTIAL PAYLOADS\n\nWBS 35.0 - SUPPORT SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT\n\nWBS 35.1\t\n\nMission Peculiar Equipment (MPE,\nThe OSTA-2 MPE was completed this period. MPESS SN001 was painted\n\non November 1, 1982, and the Structural/Mechanical MPE was painted on\nNovember 15, 1982. After weignt and C.G. testing of the MPESS, the\nStructural/Mechanical MPE and MAUS canisters were fit-checked to the MPESS.\nThe electrical cable harness was fit-checked and reworked to allow for\nlonger lengths to the MAUS cans. The enlarged bathtub Fittings were\ncompleted on January 9, 1983, and iiist,alled on the MPESS. The wing fitting\nreinforcements were already installed on the MPESS. These installations\ncompleted the MPESS. The OSTA-2 shipping configuration was completed and\nshipped to KSC on January 10, 1983, to arrive there on schedule, January\n12, 1983. Retrofit bolts to attach the bathtub fittings arrived at TBE on\nJanuary 11, 1983, and will be shipped to KSC the week of January 17, 1983.\nEight bolts for the trunnion attachment to the MPESS are to arrive at TBE\non January 19, 1983. Upon acceptance, they will be shipped to KSC.\nMPESS SN002, whose completion is being funded by OAST-1, was\nrepainted on December 3, 1982, and shipped to JSC on December 13, 1982\nSeveral electrical connectors were ordered for Mid-Deck missions.\nDelivery dates for the connectors are unknown at this time.\nWBS 75.0 - PAYLOAD INTEGRATION REQUIREMENTS\nWBS 75.2 MPE Design\nWe participated in the OSTA-2 acceptance review presentations.\nRevised critical initial flaw size (CIFS) for the OSTA-2 MAUS can\nattachment pins were calculated in response to a request from the FCB.\n\n7-1\n\nOAST-1 MPE stress analyses are in progress. Areas requiring\nimprovements were redesigned. The on-orbit thermal deflections and "1g to\nOg" defections for the Dynamic Augmentation Experiment (DAE) Sensor Head\n\nattachment MPE were completed. Assessment of the effect of these\ndeflections on the sensor head alignment was started, Also, an assessment\nof the joint movements (due to design tolerances) and their effect on the\nsensor head alignment was started, Detailed drawings for OAST-1 MPE are in\nprogress and are 25 percent complete, The portions of the MPE CEI\nSpecification (Part II), DR IR.02, and the Design Review )ackage for MPE,\nDR IR-27, for the electrical system for the OAST-1 IPL/MPE FDOR were\ninitiated, An April 1983 delivery is plannod.\nWe started the MEA-1 drawings and documentation for the FDOR data\npackage.\nDesign modifications for the generic MPESS (SN003 and subsequent)\nwere completed. Stress analyses and detail drawings were also prepared.\nCCD 75F was prepared to reflect the above changes. We performed analyses\nand participated in the test for the determination of C.G. location of\nMPESS SNOO1. The test requirements document for the generic MPESS Keel\nFitting Adapter was finalized, the test fixtures were designed, the stress\nwas analyzed, and drawings were prepared.\nCommand/Data/Communication Subsystem Integration\n\nWBS 75.3\t\n\nWe rL ponded to RIDS from the November 1982 OAST -1 IPL IDE. We\nadded notes to IPRD Tables 10-1 and 10-2 to explain the difference between\npayload and subsystem measurement/stimuli ID (M/SID) numbers.\nWe met with MSFC Flight Operations Branch personndl (A. McNair, H.\nHooper) to discuss OAST-1 POCC Requirements and inputs to POCC Annex 5. It\nappears that a question has arisen as to whether the POCC terminals will be\navailable for OAST-1 real-time monitoring, as assumed. H. Hooper wrote an\naddition to the PIP, outlining MSFC\'s requirements, and is awaiting formal\nJSC response. There has been some indication by MSFC personnel that the\nHOSC may be used instead of the POCC.\nWe confirmed that the proposed modification to SCCF to allow\nmonitoring of its Data System and Alignment Monitor is compatible with the\n\n7-2\n\nI\n\nOAST-1 FMDM, As a result, two 28V discrete outputs and two 28V discrete\ninputs were added to CDMS documents pending formal direction.\nWe assisted in drafting a memo (January 6) to R. McAnnally\nrequesting direction regarding several CDMS issues, including SAE and RAE\nserial downlink, SAE downlink additions via connector J13, and VCS Impulse\nIndication command incompatibilities. The plan is to have a meeting on\nJanuary 19 on this subject.\nWe met with G. Young (SAE Principal Investigator), R. McAnnally,\nand G. Hawkins regarding Mr. Young\'s request for adding SAE data to the\nOAST-1 downlink. A list of desired data was distributed, and an initial\nassessment; shows that the parameters and the assumed FMDM sample rate\n(1 sps) are within the 800 bits/second downlink standard accommodation.\nHowever, the total number of FMDM acquired parameters (48) including the\ntwo added SCCF measurements, now exceeds the standard allowance of 40.\nA memo ( pMIC-EXT-P341- 001(83)) on January 14 was written to G.\nHawkins, outlining our plan to add the compatible analog data at SAE J13 to\nPIP Annex 4. A compatibility assessment showed that only 15 of 35\nrequested measurements were hardware compatible with the FMDM.\nWBS 75.4 - Command and Data Requirements\n\nWe have continued the development of the data base for generation\nof OAST-1 PIP Annex 4 tables. We have completed building 15 formats for\ninputs to the JSC Payload Data Base (Appendix B) using off-line\nmicrocomputer data base software. Also, we have begun inputting the latest\ncoma,and/data requirements for OAST-1 mission in the data requirements for\nOAST-1 mission in the data base.\nWBS 75.5 - Environmental System Integration\n\nThe OAST-1 i on-orbit thermal model was updated to reflect design\nchanges since the October IDE analysis. Additional detail was added to the\nDAE Sensor Eracket and DAE Support Struts to increase thermal accuracy.\nAscent and descent models are being developed to supplement the on-orbit.\nanalysis for the FOOR. Currently, TRASYS form factor computer runs are\nbeing made for the OAST-1 design cases. A detailed SINDA model was\n\n7-3\n\n4\t\n\n1\n\ndeveloped for the PCB to assess the effects of thermal isolation and to\ndetermine the required heater power.\nWBS 75.6 Electrical Systems Integration\nAll outstanding DNs generated in the OAST-1 IPL/MPE IDE were\ncompleted and closure .documentation was submitted for approval, A revision\nof experiment IIAs, the cable interconnect diagram (CID), and the electrical\nsystem schematic was initiated in preparation for the IPL/MPE FDOR schedule\nin April 1983.\nDevelopment of the MEA-1 IPL/MPE FDOR data package was initiated\nwith revisions.of electrical sections in the IPRD, IIA, PIP Annex, and\nunique ICD. The DR IR-04 Part I Specification was revised for word\nprocessing,\n\nand the cable interconnect diagram and electrical system\n\nschematic revised for drafting.\nWBS 75.9 - Ground Operations Analysis and Requirements Definition\nFor OSTA-2, the work required by C/O Mod MSFC-178, was initiated to\ndefine the deintegration requirements and create a Part V to the GIRD. An\nECR was prepared and submitted to add GIRD requirements/constraints to\nconfigure the MANS switches on the SSP. MPESS SNO01 was moved into the A&I\nfacility and fit-check/buildup activities were started on December 1, 1982.\nSome minor problems were encountered and corrected. SNOO fit-check/buildup\nwas completed on December 22, 1982, and the OSTA-2 Shipping Configuration\nwas delivered to KSC on January 12, 1983, as scheduled.\nY\t\n\nCurrent effort being expended for OAST-1\n\nu\t\n\nis in DN incorporation and\n\npreparation of the GIRD for the FDOR.
