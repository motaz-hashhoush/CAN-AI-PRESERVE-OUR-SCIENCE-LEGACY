One of the\naims of the joint NASA/Navy/AF\nAWS Program was\nto understand\nthe\nphysical\nflow\nmechanism\nresponsible\nfor\nthe\nphenomenon.\nSuch\nan\nunderstanding can then be used to arrive at guidelines\nwith which to evaluate any new aerospace design for\nthe likelihood of AWS and if found, to fix the\nproblem in the early design phase.\nSenior Research Engineer,\n*Aerospace\nThis\n\nEngineer,\n\nmaterial\n\nis\n\nAssociate Fellow AIAA.\n\nSenior Member AIAA\ndeclared\n\na work\n\nof\n\nGovernment and is not subject to copyright\nin the United States.\n\nAmerican\n\nthe\n\nU.S.\n\nprotection\n\nThe\nprogram\ncontained\nan\nextensive\nand\ncomplementary\ncombination\nof experimental\nand\ncomputational\nstudies; both steady and unsteady, to\naccomplish this aim. These studies were designed to\nlearn the physics behind the AWS phenomenon\nby\ncomparing and contrasting data on configurations that\ndid and did not show AWS tendencies in flight. The\naircraft\nconfigurations\nstudied\nincluded\na preproduction F/A-18E and AV-8B, both showing AWS\nwhen flown at a certain combination of geometric and\nflow conditions. Results on these were compared with\nsimilar results for the F-16C and F/A-18C, both of\nwhich do not exhibit AWS in their normal operational\nregime.\nThe present study is the first of a two-part CFD study\ncomplementing the static wind-tunnel tests conducted\nduring the AWS program. Each part compares and\ncontrasts one aircraft configuration that exhibits AWS\nand one that does not. Both of these studies were\nconducted\nusing a high-fidelity,\nunstructured-grid\nbased Navier-Stokes\nsolver.

The\nfinal aim was to arrive at static Figures of Merit as\nwell as recommendations\nwhich may be used to\nscreen future aircraft designs for AWS.\nCOMPUTATIONAL\n\nAircraft\n\nConfigurations:\n\nTwo aircraft configurations\nwere\nselected\nfor\nexamination related to AWS for this study: A preproduction\nF/A-18E\nconfiguration\nwhich showed\nAWS tendencies during early flight tests and an F16C configuration that exhibited no AWS tendencies\nin its normal operational region. Since the CFD code\nwas calibrated using experimental\ndata, an attempt\nwas made to closely reproduce\nas many of the\ngeometric details of the wind-tunnel test model as\npractical\nincluding the wing tip missile and its\nattachment hardware as well as flow through ducts\nrepresenting the engine flow path. Only one side of\nthe symmetric aircraft configuration\nwas modeled,\nutilizing\na plane-of-symmetry\nboundary\ncondition\nalong the aircraft centerline. The grid resolution used\nin the CFD study was sufficient to provide a grid\nspacing of y+=l right next to the body surface based\non the wind-tunnel test Reynolds number.\n\nMETHOD\n\nAll the computations\npresented in this paper were\ncarried out using the NASA Langley developed\nTetrUSS suite of codes. TetrUSS 2 is a complete flow\nanalysis system based on unstructured,\ntetrahedral\ngrids. The Navier-Stokes\ngrids were generated and\ngrid quality improvements accomplished using the\ncomponent\ncodes VGRIDns 3 and POSTGRIDns,\nrespectively.\nThe flow solutions were obtained using the TetrUSS\nflow solver component, USM3Dns 4. This is a three\ndimensional, tetrahedral, cell-centered, finite-volume,\nEuler and Navier-Stokes\nflow solver. In USM3Dns,\nthe inviscid flux quantities are computed across each\ncell face using Roe\'s flux difference splitting (FDS).\nSpatial discretization\nis accomplished\nby a novel\nreconstruction\nprocess,\nwhich is based\non an\nanalytical\nformulation\nfor\ncomputing\nsolution\ngradients within tetrahedral cells.\nThe solution is\nadvanced to a steady state condition by an implicit\nbackward-Euler\ntime-stepping\nscheme.\nFlow\nturbulence\neffects are modeled\nby the SpalartAllmaras one equation model. USM3Dns can be run\nin either a full viscous or a wall-fimctions\nmode.\nHowever, all the calculations\nin the present\nwere performed using the full viscous mode.\n\nstudy\n\nUSM3Dns runs on massively parallel computers and\non clusters of personal computers. Although a single\nprocessor\nversion\nis available\nfor a variety of\ncomputing platforms, the parallel version 5 is the code\nof choice because it enables rapid turn-around\nfor\nlarge problems.\n\nAmerican\n\nF/A-18E\n\nF-16C\nFigure 1: Surface grid for F/A-18E\nconfigurations.\n\n2\nInstitute of Aeronautics\n\nand Astronautics\n\nand F-16C\n\nTheF/A-18E\nconfiguration\nhada flap setting\nof\n10\xc2\xb0/10\xc2\xb0/5LE/TE/Aileron\n\xc2\xb0deflections,\nrespectively,\nand been\nhas\ndesignated\nasF/A-18E,\n10/10/5 this\nin\npaper.\nTheunstructured,\nviscous ridconsisted\ng\nof\n3,786,448\ntetrahedral\ncellsand654,840\npoints.\nThe\nF-16C\nconfiguration\nmodeled\nhasa designation\nof\nBlock25to distinguishfromother onfigurations\nit\nc\nof the sameairplane\nwith smallgeometrical\ndifferences. configuration deflections\nThe\nhad0\xc2\xb0\nfor\nboththeLE andTEflaps. hegridhad6,929,816\nT\ntetrahedral and\ncells 1,205,202\npoints.\nFigure1 shows\ntriangulatedurfaces both\ns\nfor\nconfigurations.\nAlthough the full aircraft\nconfigurations\nareshown thepicture, CFD\nin\nthe\nstudy used only half-span\nconfigurations,\nas\npreviously\nstated.\nCalibration the\nof\n\nComputer\n\nexperimental\ndatafromthetwo wind-tunnel\ntests.\nNotonlydothelift coefficient, and\nCL, thepitching\nmoment oefficient,....compare ell with the\nc\nC\nw\nexperimental\ndata,the dragcoefficient, also\nCD,\nmatches\nwellwhich normally\nis\ndifficulto compute\nt\naccurately.\n\niiiiii_iiiiiiiiiiiiii\n\nCode:\n\nThe unstructured\ngrid-based N-S solver, USM3Dns,\nwas first calibrated by comparing the CFD force and\nmoment data against wind-tunnel\nresults obtained\nduring companion studies of the AWS program. For\nthe F-16C, Block 25 configuration,\nthe CFD data\nwere\ncompared\nagainst\nVeridian\n(formerly\nCALSPAN) 8-FT transonic tunnel test T05-590 and\nNASA Langley Research\nCenter (LaRC)\n16-FT\nTransonic wind-tunnel tests. The comparisons were\nmade for a free-stream Mach number of 0.8 at a series\nof angles-of-attack\n(AoA)\nfrom 6.0 o to 16.0 o.\nAlthough the two tests were run at slightly different\nunit Reynolds number (Reynolds number per foot of\n2.5 X 106 for the Veridian test versus 3.63 X 106 for\nthe LaRC test), the CFD was run to match that of the\nVeridian data. The parallel version of USM3Dns was\nrun on a SGI Origin 3000 parallel computer using 48\nprocessors at a time. Each of the solutions required\nabout 10GB of memory and a total of about 2500\nCPU hours (48 processors x 54 hours) each. For each\nrun, a stringent\nconvergence\ncriterion was used,\nwhereby the solutions were run until changes in the\nintegrated lift coefficient was less than 1.0E-06 per\niteration i.e. a change of less than 0.0005 over 500\niterations.\nAnother convergence criterion used was\nno noticeable\nchange in surface Cp distribution\nat\nselected span stations on the wing of the aircraft over\n500 iterations. For the most part, these two criteria\namounted to a reduction in global flow residuals (L2\nnorm) of about 5 orders of magnitude, and required\nbetween 3,000 and 10,000 iterations, depending upon\nthe flow initialization\nand the extent of flow\nseparation.\nIn Figure 2, computed values of the integrated lift,\ndrag and pitching moment are compared with the\n\nAmerican\n\niiiiiiiiiiiiiiii_iiiiii\niiiiiii_iiiiiiiiiiiii\n\niiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii\nFigure\n\n2: CFD-Experiment\n\nF-16C\n\n(Block\n\ncomparison\n\nfor\n\n25) configuration.\n\nThis excellent agreement testifies to the accuracy of\nthe computational method including the adequacy of\nthe grid, the turbulence model and the convergence\n\n3\nInstitute of Aeronautics\n\nand Astronautics\n\ncriteria\nused. may\nIt\nbenoted\nthattheexperimental\ndatafromthetwotunnels atch\nm\nclosely\nalthough\nbothwereobtainedt slightly\na\ndifferent\nReynolds\nnumbers. notonly\nThis\nshows\ntherepeatability\nofthe\nexperiments\nbutalso\nanegligible ofReynolds\neffect\nnumber thissmall\nover\nrange.\n\ncompared for a free stream Mach number of 0.9.

Details of this test can be\nfound in References\n6 and 7. As reported in these\nreferences, the model experienced severe vibrations\nat transonic conditions believed to be due to the\nunsteady movement of shocks on the upper surface of\nthe wing. Because of the unsteady nature of the flow\nand also as a good wind-tunnel test practice, several\nrepeat runs were made for the transonic conditions in\norder to obtain an "average" condition during these\nruns. The comparisons\nin Figure 3 and 4, show\nsteady-state CFD data plotted against an average of\nthe\nwind-tunnel\ntest\ndata.\nIn\naddition,\nthe\nunsteadiness of the experimental data is quantified by\nsuperimposing\na + two times the standard deviation\n(+2*cy) at each AoA. In Figure 3 the CL and Cm are\n\nAmerican\n\nFigure 4: CFD-Experiment\nComparison,\nF/A-18E,\n10/10/5 Configuration\nat Mach = 0.8, Re/Ft=3.8M.\nSimilar comparisons made for Mach =0.8, in Figure\n4, show that while the agreement with the lift\ncoefficient is much better, the predicted Cm is higher.\nA number of alternative studies, including a grid\nrefinement and use of a different flow solver, were\nconducted to understand the discrepancy in Cm, but\ndid not show much improvement. A companion study\nreported in Reference 8 shows improved comparison\nby using a SST turbulence model with the COBALT\nflow solver. USM3Dns at this time, however, does\nnot have a tested SST model in the code and hence\nthe stated discrepancy\n\n4\nInstitute of Aeronautics\n\nand Astronautics\n\ncould not be examined further.\n\nANALYSIS\n\nOF COMPUTATIONAL\n\nRESULTS\n\nThe main aim of the present work is to understand the\ndifference\nin flow\nphysics\nbetween\nthe\ntwo\nconfigurations studied. It is known, from an analysis\nof some historical data s as well as from wind-tunnel\nstudies conducted during this program, that AWS is a\nresult of one of the wings of an aircraft experiencing a\nsudden loss of lift resulting from a sudden movement\nof separation caused by a small change in the angle of-attack. Thus, an AWS event is characterized\nby a\nsudden change in the lift curve slope. The CFD\nresults presented in the earlier section show such a\nbehavior\nfor\nthe\npre-production\nF/A- 18E\nconfiguration at AoA 9.5 and 8.0 degrees for freestream Mach numbers of 0.9 and 0.8, respectively. In\ncontrast, the F-16C results shown in Figure 2 display\na smooth, almost linear variation. It is, therefore,\nimplied that important Figures of Merit characterizing\nAWS can be developed by studying the differences in\nthe simulated physical phenomena\nassociated with\nthese two aircraft.\n\nc) cx = 10.0 \xc2\xb0\n\niiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii_iiiiiiiii\n\niiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii_iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii\n\nd) @ = 12.0 0\n\na) cx = 6.0 0\n\ne) \xc2\xa2x = 14.0 0\n\nb)cx = 8.0 0\n\nAmerican\n\nFigure\n5:\nCp\ndistribution\nand\nseparation\nprogression on the wing upper surface for F-16C\nat M=0.8.\n\n5\nInstitute of Aeronautics\n\nand Astronautics\n\nIn lightof these\nobservations,\ntheCFD\nresults re\na\nanalyzed\nforthewingupper urface\ns\nCpdistribution\nand\nthebehavior flowseparation\nof\nastheangle-ofattack increased a fixedfree-stream\nis\nfor\nMach\nnumber.\nFigure showscollagefsuch\n5\na\no\nplots,\none\nforeach\nAoA,forthebenign -16C\nF\nconfiguration.\nForeach\nframe,\ntherightside\nshows\nthesurface\nCp\ndistribution onthe\nwhile\nleftside\nsurface\ncontours\nof\nnegative\nstream-wise\nvelocityare displayed,\nthe\nextent f which\no\nrepresents\nflowseparation\nonthe\nsurface.\nForlower ngles-of-attack\na\nonlyanarrow\nportionear\nn\nthewing\nleadingdge\ne shows\nflowseparation.\nAsthe\nangle-of-attack\nincreases, separation\nthe\nregion\nslowly\nspreads\nfurther\ndownstream\nbutthelift onthe\nconfiguration increasing partdueto an\nkeeps\nin\nincreased\ncontribution a stronger\nfrom\nLeading\nEdge\nExtension vortex\n(LEX)\nA similar ollage shown Figure fortheF/Ac\nis\nin\n6\n18E\nconfiguration free-stream number\nata\nMach\nof\n0.8.

This sudden change\nin the\nseparation behavior is associated with a sudden drop\nin the overall lift for the wing. If this happens\nasymmetrically,\nthe aircraft may experience a large\nrolling moment and hence AWS.\n\niiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii\n::iiii\n\xc2\xb8\xc2\xb8,:!iii_\n\niiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii_!_i_i_i_i_i_i\n\'_\'_\n......................................................\niiiiii_\n\niiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii\niiiiiii_\n\niiiiii_\n\na) \xc2\xa2z = 4.0 0\n..........................................................\ni:i_i_i_i iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii\n.............\n\n!i!i!i!i\n...............................................................\niiiiii_\n\niiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii\niiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii_iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii\niiiiiiiiiii\n\niiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii\niiiiiiiii_iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii_iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii\n.......\niiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii_iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii_:_:_:_:_:\n\niiiiii_\n\nIn summary, the abrupt change in the extent of\nseparation on the wing upper surface resulting from a\nsmall change in angle-of-attack\ncan be indicative of\nAWS on a configuration.\n\niiiiiiiiiii\n\nc)\n\nAmerican\n\n6\nInstitute of Aeronautics\n\nand Astronautics\n\n= 7.0 0\n\ncontribution\nto the total rolling moment of the\naircraft.

Hence the effect of separation on only\none of the wings is harder to quantify by measuring\nthe rolling moment.\nAs an alternative,\nthe windtunnel programs use wing root bending moment\n(WRBM) measured by one or more gauges located\nnear the wing root to quantify the effect of separation\non the wing.\nBased on these considerations,\ntwo aerodynamic\nindicators or Figures of Merit have been proposed\nand are tested in this study; 1) the span-wise\ndistribution of the wing sectional lift coefficient and\nits rate of change with respect to c_,and 2) the change\nin the wing root bending moment as AoA changes.\n\nd) _ = 8.0 0\n\nSpan-wise\n\ndistribution\n\nof Sectional Lift:\n\nThe sectional\nlift coefficient\nis defined\nas the\nintegrated value of the upper and lower surface Cp\ndistribution\nat a wing span station, where Cp is\nobtained from the CFD solution.\n1\n\nc I = IACp\n\nd(x/c)\n\n0\n\nThe span-wise\nvariation\nis then\nobtained\nby\ncalculating the above integral at several span-wise\nlocations.

As shown for the F/A-18E aircraft,\nsuch indicators have to be related to changes in the\nseparation\npattern\non the lifting\nwing.\nLocal\nseparation anywhere on a wing should result in a\ncorresponding\ndecrease in lift contribution\nof that\nwing panel to the overall lift.

Since normally a\nCFD study is performed on only half of a symmetrical\nconfiguration\nto save computational\nresources, and\nsince the rolling moment calculated for 1A of the\nconfiguration\n(termed Half-Plane Rolling Moment,\nHPRM)\nis a routine\noutput\nfor most\nCFD\ncomputations, it can be used, instead of WRBM, as a\npotential FOM. This is shown in Figure 12 where\nHPRM is compared for the two configurations.\nThe\nsimilarity of the curves in Figures 11 and 12, thus\nestablishes\nHPRM\nfrom 1A configuration\nCFD\nanalyses as a viable FOM for any AWS study.\nIn addition, as has been shown in Part II of this study\n(Ref. 1), at times the HPRM versus AoA curve is a\nlittle clearer indicator of the wing stall compared to a\nlift curve.\nIn summary, as shown above, the potential FOMs for\nany abrupt wing stall study using steady CFD are:\n1.\n\nThe span-wise variation of sectional lift and\nits rate of change with respect to AoA, and\n\nAmerican\n\nA validated CFD procedure based on an unstructured\ngrid method and steady state Navier-Stokes solutions\nhas been developed for evaluating AWS behavior of\naircraft. A set of Figures\nof Merit have been\ndeveloped\nby\nanalyzing\nCFD\nresults\non\nconfigurations\nthat do and do not show AWS\ntendencies. The static FOMs include slope change in\nthe CL and WRBM versus AoA curve as well as a\nsudden change in the span-wise distribution of local\nlift. In addition, the half-plane\nrolling moment\n(HPRM) calculated\nfrom 1A configuration\nCFD is\nshown to provide the same information in predicting\nAWS as the WRBM, thus establishing HPRM as a\nviable FOM for steady state CFD studies.\nResults of these and other companion CFD studies\nconducted under the AWS program have been used to\nprepare CFD based recommendations 1\xc2\xb0 that may be\nused to evaluate\nfuture configurations\nfor AWS\nsusceptibility or lack their of.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThis work was supported by the NASA Aerospace\nSystems\nConcepts\nto Test (ASCOT)\nprogram,\nNAVAIR, and the Office of Naval Research.\nThe\nauthors would like to thank Dr. Edward Parlette of\nVigyan, Inc. for grid generation help and to Mr.\nJonathan\nNehrbass,\na co-op\nstudent\nin the\nConfiguration\nAerodynamics\nBranch at NASA\nLangley, for graphics related help.\n\n9\nInstitute of Aeronautics\n\nand Astronautics\n\nREFERENCES\n\n1.\n\nChung, J., and Parikh, P., "A Computational\nStudy\nof the Abrupt\nWing\nStall\n(AWS)\nCharacteristics\nfor various Fighter Jets: Part II,\nAV-8B\nand\nF/A-18C",\nAIAA-2003-0747,\nJanuary 2003.\n\n2.\n\nFrink, N.T., Pirzadeh, S., Parikh, P., Pandya,\nM.J., and Bhat, M.K., "The NASA Tetrahedral\nUnstructured\nSoftware System (TetrUSS)",\nThe\nAeronautical\nJournal,\nVol. 104, No. 1040,\nOctober 2000, pp. 491-499.\n\n3.\n\nPirzadeh,\nS., "Three-Dimensional\nUnstructured\nViscous\nGrids\nby the\nAdvancing\nLayers\nMethod", AIAA Journal, Vol. 34, No. 1, January\n1996, pp. 43-49.\n\n4.\n\nFrink, N.T., "Tetrahedral\nUnstructured\nNavierStokes Method\nfor Turbulent\nFlows", AIAA\nJournal, Vol. 36, No. 11, November 1998, pp.\n1975-1982.\n\n5.\n\nBhat,\nM.\nK.\nand\nParikh,\nP.,\n"Parallel\nImplementation\nof an Unstructured\nGrid-Based\nNavier-Stokes\nSolver", AIAA Paper 99-0663,\nJanuary 1999.\n\n6.\n\nMcMillin,\nN.,\nHall,\nR. and\n"Understanding\nAbrupt\nWing\nExperimental\nMethods (Invited)",\n0591, January 2003.\n\n7.\n\nSchuster, D. and Byrd, J., "Transonic Unsteady\nAerodynamics\nof the F/A-18E\nat Conditions\nPromoting Abrupt Wing Stall (Invited)", AIAA2003-0593, January 2003.\n\n8.\n\nForsythe, J.
