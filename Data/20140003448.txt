Elevated bone\nresorption is a hallmark of human spaceflight and bed rest (common zero-G analog). We tested whether an\nantiresorptive drug in combination with in-flight exercise would ameliorate bone loss and hypercalcuria during longduration spaceflight. Measurements include DXA, QCT, pQCT, and urine and blood biomarkers. We have\ncompleted analysis of 7 crewmembers treated with alendronate during flight and the immediate postflight (R+<2\nweek) data collection in 5 of 10 controls without treatment. Both groups used the advanced resistive exercise device\n(ARED) during their missions.\nWe previously reported the pre/postflight results of crew taking alendronate during flight (Osteoporosis Int.\n24:2105\xe2\x80\x932114, 2013). The purpose of this report is to present the 12-month follow-up data in the treated astronauts\nand to compare these results with preliminary data from untreated crewmembers exercising with ARED (ARED\ncontrol) or without ARED (Pre-ARED control). Results: the table presents DXA and QCT BMD expressed as\npercentage change from preflight in the control astronauts (18 Pre-ARED and the current 5 ARED-1-year data not\nyet available) and the 7 treated subjects. As shown previously the combination of exercise plus antiresorptive is\neffective in preventing bone loss during flight. Bone measures for treated subjects, 1 year after return from space\nremain at or near baseline values. Except in one region, the treated group maintained or gained bone 1 year after\nflight. Biomarker data are not currently available for either control group and therefore not presented. However, data\nfrom other studies with or without ARED show elevated bone resorption and urinary Ca excretion while\nbisphosphonate treated subjects show decreases during flight. Comparing the two control groups suggests significant\nbut incomplete improvement in maintaining BMD using the newer exercise protocols compared to earlier resistive\nexercise protocols. Quantitative characterization of this improvement requires additional measurements in the\nARED control group that we are currently collecting. In conclusion, these results indicate that an antiresorptive may\nbe an effective adjunct to exercise during long-duration spaceflight.\n% Change from Preflight (Mean \xc2\xb1 SD)\nPre-ARED Control\n(n=18)\nR+<2 week\nDXA BMD\nTotal Hip\nTrochanter\nFemur Neck\nLumbar Spine\nQCT BMD\nTrabecular Total Hip\nCortical Total Hip\nTrabecular Trochanter\nCortical Trochanter\nTrabecular Femur Neck\nCortical Femur Neck\n\nARED Control\n(n=5)\nR+<2 week\n\n-6.2 \xc2\xb1 2.8\n-6.8 \xc2\xb1 4.8\n-6.6 \xc2\xb1 3.0\n-3.9 \xc2\xb1 3.2\n\n-2.7 \xc2\xb1 3.2\n-3.8 \xc2\xb1 2.9\n0.8 \xc2\xb1 4.6\n-3.7 \xc2\xb1 2.3\n\n-0.2 \xc2\xb1 1.5\n0.02 \xc2\xb1 2.3\n-0.7 \xc2\xb1 1.2\n2.8 \xc2\xb1 4.0\n\n0.8 \xc2\xb1 1.4\n2.1 \xc2\xb1 1.2\n1.5 \xc2\xb1 1.7\n3.9 \xc2\xb1 3.8\n\n-6.9 \xc2\xb1 8.0\n-3.6 \xc2\xb1 0.4\n-5.6 \xc2\xb1 7.8\n-4.6 \xc2\xb1 1.4\n-15.8 \xc2\xb1 15.8\n-3.2 \xc2\xb1 2.6\n\n-1.1 \xc2\xb1 9.8\n-0.6 \xc2\xb1 4.7\n-1.9 \xc2\xb1 9.9\n-0.5 \xc2\xb1 5.0\n6.5 \xc2\xb1 14.8\n-1.0 \xc2\xb1 4.8\n\n-1.1 \xc2\xb1 12.1\n-2.9 \xc2\xb1 3.7\n-1.2 \xc2\xb1 12.4\n-3.2 \xc2\xb1 4.3\n2.8 \xc2\xb1 7.2\n-3.9 \xc2\xb1 3.1\n\n\xe2\x88\x9213.6 \xc2\xb1 6.4\n\xe2\x88\x923.2 \xc2\xb1 3.5\n\xe2\x88\x9213.5 \xc2\xb1 6.5\n\xe2\x88\x923.2 \xc2\xb1 3.3\n\xe2\x88\x9215.0 \xc2\xb1 9.8\n\xe2\x88\x924.0 \xc2\xb1 5.5\n\nAlendronate Treated\n(n=7)\nR+<2 week\nR+1 year\n\n'
