This facility, along with the special test equipment (STE) required for facility support, was constructed specifically to test and verify the sealing capability of the Redesigned Solid Rocket Motor (RSRM) field, igniter, and nozzle joints. The test article consists of full scale RSRM hardware loaded with inert propellant and assembled in a short stack configuration. The TPTA is pressurized by igniting a propellant cartridge capable of inducing a pressure rise rate which stimulates the ignition transient that occurs during launch. Dynamic loads are applied during the pressure cycle to simulate external tank attach (ETA) strut loads present on the ETA ring. Sealing ability of the redesigned joints is evaluated under joint movement conditions produced by these combined loads since joint sealing ability depends on seal resilience velocity being greater than gap opening velocity. Also, maximum flight dynamic loads are applied to the test article which is either pressurized to 600 psia using gaseous nitrogen (GN2) or applied to the test article as the pressure decays inside the test article on the down cycle after the ignition transient cycle. This new test facility is examined with respect to its capabilities. In addition, both the topic of test effectiveness versus space vehicle flight performance and new aerospace test techniques, as well as a comparison between the old SRM design and the RSRM are presented.", "title": "Transient Pressure Test Article Test Program", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T15:08:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19900009147, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Vibbart, Charles M."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Marshall Space Flight Center", "location": "Huntsville, AL, United States"}}, "id": "0f74107b6743438b852c8172edc13657"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19900009147, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19900009147, "id": "16537de179764a4d8eaf7858bb47188a", "publicationName": "Johns Hopkins Univ., The 1989 JANNAF Propulsion Meeting, Volume 1", "publicationDate": "1989-05-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19900009147.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19900009147/downloads/19900009147.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19900009147/downloads/19900009147.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19900009147/downloads/19900009147.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
