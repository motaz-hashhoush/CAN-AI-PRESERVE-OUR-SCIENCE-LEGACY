Sudre.\nHardly had aviation emerged from the experimental stage, be.\nfore Franoe began to think of the,improvement in International\n\xe2\x80\x9crelationswhidh should acorue from the oonqueat of tineair.\nNothing oould better demonstrate this desire for general harmony\nthan the attempt made in M1O by the Frenoh &vernment to oon~ .\nelude an international aerial convention.\nThis projeot, not meeting everywhere the same oonourrenoe,\nwas abandoned. It W8A renewed, this time with suooess, when the\nconsiderable development of aerial navigation during the war of\n1914-18 necessitated, at the olose of hostilities, the solution \xe2\x80\x9c\nof a series of questions, which had yet hardly been touohed.\nAs regards air traffic, it was neoessary to establish general prin~iples, according to whioh airoraft could ciroulate in\ntheir own oountry d\n\npass frbm one oountry to smother.\nNational Le@s3a tlon\n\nThis was the task undertaken by the convention for regulating air navigation, whiah was signed Ootober 13, 1919, by tke representativee of 27 governments. The exohange of ratifloatlon of\nthis convention was delayed by the faot that the United State$\nand Canada formulated oertain reservations, whioh had to be examined,\n* From \xe2\x80\x9cPremier Congrds International de \xe2\x80\x9cla Navigation Ae\xe2\x80\x9drienne,\n\xe2\x80\x9c\nParis, November, 1921, Vol. 1, pp. 161-4.\n\n----\n\n.\n\n-\n\n_ .. _ _ -._..\n\n\xe2\x80\x94.\xe2\x80\x94\n\n.\xe2\x80\x9c\n\n..\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\n\nOn the other hand, a certain nkmber of neutral oountries requested, before giving their adhesion to this convention, that az.. .\n. . . . .. .L-----,-u .-.\n. ..\n.....\nother protoool be added permitting, under certain conditions,.\nderogations of artiole 5 of the contention of Ootober 13, 1.919, art-.\nem\niole .whlchobliged the contracting oountrles to forbid the criroulation, shove their territory, of the airoreft of non-oontra.otlng\ngovernments.\nWhile awaiting the ratlfioation of the convention, provisional\nagreements were made, on the basis of the principles oontalned in\nit, between Franoe and England, Franoe and Switzerland and aze now\nbeing arranged between France, Holland smd SpairL A modus vivendi\nhas been established on the same principles between France and\nBelgium.\nThe work accomplished by the convention of Ootober 13, 1919,\nwas considerable, shoe\n\nit established the general principles and\n\nthe soope of international aerial legislation and has consequently\ndetermined the Interior legislation, whioh must harmonize with the\nclauses of this general \xe2\x80\x9cohart of the air.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe importance of this dooument necessitates a brief srsmmrg.\n.\nAfter establishing a few principles of a general nature, the convention enunciates, in ohapters 1, II and III, the pales to follow\nregarding the nationality of airoraft, oertlfioates of navigability\nand oertlfioates of fitness of pilots.\xe2\x80\x9d Ohapter IV is devoted to air\nnavlgat.ion\nover a foreign oountry and ohapter V to lhe rules to be\nobserved in starting, en route and in landing.

The convention\nof October, 1919, was thus an attempt to realize an aerial Sooiety\nof nations.\nThe oqnventlon of 1919 having established international bases\nfor national legislation, the Fzenoh Government was enabled to resume its pro$eot of May 7, 1913, whiti had been abandoned after\nthe failure of the proposed international convention of 1910.\nA new legislative bill, signedby the mlnl.stersof Foreign\nAffairs, Publio Woxks, Interior, War, Navy and Finance was dsposited\nMaroh 25, 1920, on the desk of the Ohamber of Deputies.\nThe prlnolples laid down In the convention of 1919 were falthtily\n\nfollowed and the oonsequenoes deduoe&\n\nThe rules adopted be-\n\nfore the war by the deoree of Deoember 16, 1913, and whioh inspired\nthe legislative bill of the same year, were adapted to the new oiroumstanoes and conditions of avalatiom\n\nThis bill, after various\n\namendments, was adopted by the Ohamber of Deputies and Is nay before\nthe Senate.\n\n,.\n\n. .\n. .\nOn the othea hand, while amaithg the aotion of @arli&ent,\n\nthere was urgent need of harmonizing\n\ntine Frenoh Interior regula-\n\n1-\xe2\x80\x94\n\nkA#L\n.\n\ntiohs~ dbntatmld in a deoree of\xe2\x80\x99Deoembez 16, 1913S with the\n\nnew\n\nex-\n\nigemles of aerial locomotion, as well aa with the international\nagreements already ti.\n\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9c \xe2\x80\x9c\n\n-\xe2\x80\x9c-\xe2\x80\x93\n\xe2\x80\x98\xe2\x80\x9c-\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nFrenoh Intezior Remilations..\nThe deoree of July 8, 1920, responded to thts need and laid\ndown the general prinoiplea of aerial navigation in Fr&noe.\n\nIt\n\n.\n\nleft the details \xe2\x80\x9cof regulation to a series of orders whloh appeared\nduring the past year.\ncode of the air.\n\nThese doouments now constitute the Frenoh\n\nA brief enumeration of the prinoipal.ones will\n\nsufflolently lndtoate the breadth and complexity of the problems\nstudied, as well as the very advanoed degree of orga??izatlon\nalready attained by air treffio in Frame.\nDeoree of August 9, 1920, regulating the employment of radio\nfor proteotlng the flight of airoraft (nJournal Offioiel,\xe2\x80\x9d September\n2, 1920; \xe2\x80\x98Bulletin de la Navigation Aeriennew No. 7, October, 1920),\nDeoree of August i4, 1920, establishing the conditions for the\nissuan~ of oertifioates of navigability for airoraft (nJournal Officiel,n August 14, 1S20; Bulletin No. 6, September, 1920).\nDeoree of August 14, 1920, fixing the seglstrqtlon rules for\nairoraft and the dlstl~otive marks to be borne.by them (wJournal Officiel,n Au~st\n\ni4, 1920; Bull&ln No. 6, September, 1920).\n\nDeoree of August 26, 1920, regulating air travel, beaoons and\nslgpals (nJo-izrnal\nOffioiel,n Au~et\n- her, 1920).\n\n29, 1980; Bulletin No. 6, Septem-\n\n.\n\nDecree of September 18, 1920, relating to lioenses for oivillan\n\n\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x94.\n\nI\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c5pllots (nJournal Off~oiel,~ Septdlber 24, 1920; Bulletin No. ?,\nOotober, 1920).\nDemree of S&t&b&\n\n30, 1920, establishing the rules to follow\n\nin keeping books on aizoraft (\xe2\x80\x9cJournal Offlolel,n Ootober 5) 1920;\nBulletin No. 8, I?member,\n\n1920).\n\nDeoree of January 12, 1921, establishing the oustoms re~\ntions to be observed by airoraft landing in or leaving Frame\n(\xe2\x80\x9cJ~\n\nOffioiel,n January 18, 1921; Bulletln No. 11, Feb~,\n\n1921)\n\nq\n\nDeoree of June 10, 1921, abrogating previous dispositions relat-\n\ning to zones forbidden to aerial navigation (llJournal\nOfficiel,n\nJue\n\n23, 1921).\nDeoree of June 10, 1921, regulating the transportation aad use\n\nof photograph and kinetagraph oameras on airor~t\n\n(mJournal OffiOi-\n\nel,n June 23, 1921).\nDeoree of August 23, 1921, doing away with the nedloal examination for the license of the pilot of a touring airplane (nJo~\nOffioiel,m August 25, 1921).\nInaneotion of Airoraft and Pilots.\n\n-\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\n\nLastly, a oertain number of departmental docm%ents have determined the applloation of these decrees, as regards the supervision\nto be exeroised over the pilot and aircmaft, as well from the professional \xe2\x80\x9cad teohni~l point of viek, as from the physlo~\n\nand =-\n\ntwrial.\nThus the Instructions of August 31, 1920, fixed the teohnloal\n\n.\n\n\xe2\x80\x94\n.\n\n~Goondltions to be fulfIlled by airoraft f&. the\nbillty oertlf1oates.
