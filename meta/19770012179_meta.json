The electrophoresis equipment was designed for the separation of four mixtures of biological cells with variable sample flow rates, buffer flow rates, and electric field gradients. Separation quality was assessed by measuring the light from a quartz lamp through the electrophoresis channel and onto a photodiode system. The data evaluation indicates that all monitored systems operated correctly during the experiment. The optical system produced a light that was too bright to discern true cell distributions, but final analysis of scientific data by computer processing shows the expected distribution of separated cells.", "title": "Electrophoresis experiment.
