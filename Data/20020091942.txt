b"Robotic System\nA complicated design project, successfully carried out\nby a New York manufacturing consultant with help\nfrom the NASA-sponsored New England Research\nApplication Center (NERAC), has resulted in a new type\nof robotic system being marketed for industrial use.\nConsultant Robert Price, operating as E.S.-I\n(Enlightened Self-Interest), Albany, New York, was\nawarded a contract by Watervliet Arsenal, Watervliet,\nNew York to develop an automated tool and the\nnecessary software for deburring the inside of eight-inch\nbreech ring assemblies for howitzers produced by the\narsenal. The assembly is a 450-pound unit with complex,\nstepped internal threads needed to hold the breech block\nin place when the howitzer is fired. Deburring involves\nsmoothing, or finishing, hundreds of small steel burrs in\nedges of the teeth of the breech ring. Formerly the burrs\nwere removed by hand grinding, with some hazard to\nworkers from noise, metal fragments and dust. The\narsenal wanted a more efficient, hazard-free way of\ndoing the job. This required design of a special tool\ncalled an end effector to go inside the breech ring\nbushing. Additionally, Price's contract called for\ndevelopment of a computer program that would enable\nan operator to direct the cutting tool over the very\ncomplex contours of the breech ring.\nPrice sought help from NERAC, which conducted a\ncomputerized search of the NASA data base and six\nothers; this work was co-sponsored by the Small\nBusiness Administration Technology Assistance Program.\nThe NASA data base yielded basic information on robot\noff-line programming methodology. NERAC's research\nalso identified university and industry sources that\nprovided additional information on which Price could\nbase his work.\nPrice designed a system consisting of a standard\nindustrial robot arm (top)_manufactured\nby ASEA,\nMilwaukee, Wisconsin_with\na specially engineeredsix\naxis deburring tool fitted to it, a microcomputer and a\ncomputer program to direct the tool on its path through\nthe breech ring. To assemble the hardware and provide\nsoftware assistance, Price enlisted the help of a\nsubcontractor_Henderson\nIndustries, West Caldwell,\nNew Jersey. The resulting robotic deburring tool, or end\neffector, is shown in the center photo; a graphic display\nunit, such as the one shown at right, allows Watervliet\nArsenal personnel to monitor the deburring operation.\nE.S.-I. is now marketing the system to aerospace and\nmetal cutting industries for deburring, drilling, routing\nand refining machined parts.\n\n77\n\n"
