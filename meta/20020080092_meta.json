Expulsive separation \"blankets\" are applied to airplane wings, helicopter rotors, engine inlets, etc. A strong direct current pulse is passed through conductors embedded in the blanket, causing an explosive expansion of the blanket that ejects the ice. The original system has been significantly improved by the company. The power supply weighed nearly 40 pounds for eight square feet of blanket; the advanced system's power supply drives 16 square feet of blanket and weighs less than 10 pounds.", "title": "Ice Protection", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-07T12:52:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-27T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20020080092, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20020080092, "isbn": "0-16-045368-2", "id": "c44adb9820db48d1a867f8696c18221d", "publicationName": "Spinoff 1994", "publicationDate": "1994-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20020080092.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20020080092/downloads/20020080092.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20020080092/downloads/20020080092.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20020080092/downloads/20020080092.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
