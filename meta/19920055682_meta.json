Attention is given to the objective of the lunar and Martian projects as well as to the phased exploration strategy involving the Space Station Freedom, the lunar surface, and ultimately permanently manned bases on the moon and Mars. Mission profiles are illustrated for piloted and cargo missions, and the development of earth-to-orbit launch vehicles is reviewed emphasizing the uses of the Shuttle-C and the heavy-lift launch vehicle. Launch-site operations flow concepts are described for the lunar and lunar/Mars phases, and the baseline ground-processing scenarios are shown to define the preliminary facility requirements. The overview demonstrates the areas of development required for achieving the goals of the HEI program.", "title": "Human Exploration Initiative", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-15T15:25:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19920055682, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Goldsby, William D."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Kennedy Space Center", "location": "Cocoa Beach, FL, United States"}}, "id": "67b67f23720b4d7c80bd59e8c68055a5"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-19T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 19920055682, "endDate": "1990-04-27T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "NASA"}}, "meetingId": "fc1352ef9eb54f18b09118c8ec058fe3", "id": "b0cc792241f84d69926bb16052f94b6d"}, {"meta": {"organization": {"name": "Canaveral Council of Technical Societies"}}, "meetingId": "fc1352ef9eb54f18b09118c8ec058fe3", "id": "a58942fe258f4e489feae032e40df86e"}, {"meta": {"organization": {"name": "DOD"}}, "meetingId": "fc1352ef9eb54f18b09118c8ec058fe3", "id": "532467522a184da88f12666f0260c707"}], "name": "Space Congress", "location": "Cocoa Beach, FL", "id": "fc1352ef9eb54f18b09118c8ec058fe3", "startDate": "1990-04-24T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "id": 19920055682, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19920055682, "id": "7e54b27b8e334cc386cce6a23eaa17ae", "publicationDate": "1990-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
