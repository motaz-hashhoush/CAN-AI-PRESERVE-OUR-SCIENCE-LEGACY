Past missions include the Magellan  and Pioneer-Venus missions by the US; the Venera program by the USSR; and the Vega missions through international cooperation. Furthermore, the US National Research Council (NRC), in  the 2003 Solar System Exploration (SSE) Decadal Survey, identified Venus as a high priority target, thus demonstrating a continuing interest in Earth's sister planet. In response to the  NRC recommendation, the 2005 NASA SSE Roadmap included a number of potential Venus missions arching through all mission classes from small Discovery, to medium New Frontiers and to  large Flagship class missions. While missions in all of these classes could be designed as orbiters with remote sensing capabilities, the desire for scientific advancements beyond our  current knowledge - including what we expect to learn from the ongoing ESA Venus Express mission - point to in-situ exploration of Venus.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"country": "Netherlands", "submissionId": 20060043662, "endDate": "2006-01-20T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "Venus Entry Probe Workshop", "location": "Noordwijk", "id": "af21e4d1eeae4ab5a0f7af6b4721c81d", "startDate": "2006-01-19T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20060043662, "id": "d107ab8e26054bf7940a59ba87784f0a", "publicationDate": "2006-01-19T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
