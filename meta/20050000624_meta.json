Cell nuclei were approximated by oblate spheroids with dimensions and location taken from a previous histomorphometric study. The Monte Carlo simulation is applicable for planar and diffuse labels at plane or cylindrical bone surfaces. Additionally, the mean nuclear dose per hit, the dose mean per hit, the mean track segment length and its second moment, the percentage of stoppers, and the frequency distribution of the dose have been determined. Some basic features of the hit statistics for bone lining cells have been outlined, and the consequences of existing standards of radiation protection with regard to the hit frequency to cell nuclei are discussed.", "title": "Hit rates and radiation doses to nuclei of bone lining cells from alpha-particle-emitting radionuclides", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-22T16:17:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20050000624, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Polig, E."}, "organization": {"name": "Kernforschungszentrum Karlsruhe, Institut fur Genetik und fur Toxikologie von Spaltstoffen, Germany"}}, "id": "9173806ce71a4fd6bfce643dc4886339"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 20050000624, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Jee, W.
