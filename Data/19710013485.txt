No. 534,564\n10 Claims. (Cl. 323-56)\n\n.\n\nThe invention described herein was made in the Wformance of work under a NASA contract and is subject\nto the provisions Of section 305 Of the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 19587 Public Law 85-568 (72 Stat.\n435; 42 U.S.C. 2457).\nThis invention relates in general to electronic Power\nsupplies and, more ParticUlarlY, to an automatic Power\nfactor correction system.\nWhen supplying power to a load having a very low\npower factor, large leading or lagging current results\nwhen the desired output power lever is attained. If the\nefficiency of the power SUPPlY is to be Optimum, it becomes necessary to adjust the power factor, as Seen by\nthe power amplifying elements, to as close to unity as\npossible. Previous load compensating techniques require\nthe insertion of an inductor into the load circuit if the\nload was highly capacitive, and, Vice versa, a capacitor\ninto the load circuit when the load was highly inductive.\nWith the reactance inserted equal to the negative reactance of the load, a minimum of current is needed in order\nto produce the desired output Power for the bad. Should\nthe capacitance or inductance of the load vary, it becomes\nnecessary to once again change the inductance Or CaPacitance, respectively.\nIn order to overcome the attendant disadvantages of\nprior art power factor correction systems for use in\npower supplies where the highly reactive load is variable,\nthe power supply in the present invention automatically\ncorrects the power factor of a reactive load, as seen by\nthe power amplifying elements of a Power amplifier. As a\nresult thereof, the power amplifier system of the Present\ninvention provides optimum power Conversion effiCienoY,\nimproved regulation, which results in increased reliability\nin the power amplifying elements.\nMore particularly, the circuit comprises an input transformer having a source of A.C. voltage applied to the\ninput terminals thereof. The output terminals are connected to a pair of transistors connected for push-pull\nClass B operation. The output of the transistors are connected to the input side of a pair of output transformers,\nthe output side of the output transformers bel% connected across a load having a variable reactance. The\noutput transformers further comprise Control windings\nhaving a direct current applied thereto which is a function of the load circuit and which varies the self-inductante of the output tramformers in such a manner as to\nProvide a unity Power factor as viewed from the tram\nsistors.\nThe advantage of this invention, both as to its construction and mode of operation, Will be readily aPPreciated as the Same become better understood by references to the following detailed description when considered in connection with the accompanying drawings\nin which like reference numerals designate like parts\nthroughout the figures, and wherein:\nFIG. 1 is a circuit diagram of the novel power supply\nin accordance with this invention wherein the load is\nnormally capacitive;\nFIG.\nis an alternative embodiment of the output\ntransformer utilized in the device of FIG. 1;\nFIG. 3 is a circuit diagram of the novel power supply\nin accordance with this invention wherein the load is\nnormally inductive; and\n\n1o\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n60\n\n55\n\n60\n\n65\n\nFIG. 4 is a circuit diagr\nof the novel power supply\nutilizing a feedback control circuit to correct for either\nan inductive or capacitive reactive load.\nReferring now to FIG. 1, there is shown a power supply\ncircuit for correcting the power factor of a capacitive\nload. The circuit contains an input transformer 12 having\na pair of input terminals 14, 16 connected across the\ninput winding of the transformer 12. A pair of output\nterminals 18, 22 are connected across the output winding\nof transformer 12, the output winding center tap being\nconnected to ground. The output terminal 18 is connected\nto a transistor 24 at its base 26. The transistor 24 further\ncomprises a collector 28 and emitter 32. The output terminal 22 is connected to a transistor 34 at its base 36\nThe transistor 34 further comprises a collector 38 and an\nemitter 42. The collector 28 and the collector 38 are\njoined together and connected to a positive source of\npower supply (B+).\nThe circuit further comprises a first output transformer\n44 having an input winding 46 whose center tap is connected to ground, a control winding 48, and an output\nwinding 52. A second output transformer 54 has an input\nwinding 56 having a center tap connected to ground, a\ncontrol winding 5$, and an output winding 62. The emitter 32 of transistor 24 is connected to one side of the input winding 46 and to one side of the input winding 56.\nThe emitter 42 is connected to the other side of input\nwinding 46 and the other side of input winding 56.\nDirect current for the control windings 48 and 58 are\nproduced by a diode rectifier bridge 63 formed of a first\ndiode 64, a second diode 56, a third diode 68, and a\nfourth diode 72. The cathodes of diodes 64 and 66 are\njoined together and connected to one side of the control\nwinding 48. The other side of the control winding 48 is\nconnected to one side of the control winding 58, the other\nside of the control winding 58 being connected to the\njunction of the anodes of diodes 68 and 72.\nThe load 73 for the circuit is schematically illustrated\nas comprising a 74, aof parallel paths. The resistor 78, all\nprises a switch pair capacitor 76, and a first path comconnected in series. The second parallel path comprises\na switch 82, a capacitor 84, and a resistor 86, all connected in series. One side of the load 73 is connected to\none side of the output winding 52, the other side of the\noutput winding 52 being connected to one side of the\noutput winding 62. ~1~~ other side of the output winding\n62 is connected to the junction of the anode of diode 64\nand the cathode of diode 72. The other side of the load 73\nis connected to both the junction of the anode of diode 66\nand the cathode of diode 68. Further, a trimming resistor\n8%is connected on one side to the junction of the anode\nof diode 64 and the cathode of diode 72, and on the other\nto the junction of the anode of diode 66 and the\ncathode of diode 68.\nThe transistors 24, 34 provide a push-pull input to the\nparallel connected input windings 46, 56, and the output\nwindings 52, 62 provide a series connected single-ended\noutput. With the switches 74 and 82 open, the unloaded\ntransformer will draw a small lagging reactive current in\nthe input windings of transformers 44, 54 and a voltage\nwill appear\nthe windings 52, 62, which is a function\nof the turns ratio from the input side to the output side of\nthe transformers 44, 54. No voltage will appear\nthe windings 48, 58. If a D.C. current is supplied to the\nwindings 48, 58, the transformer\nbecome slightly\nsaturated, the incremental permeability will decrease,\nthereby decreasing the self-inductance, and the lagging\ncurrent drawn by the transformer will increase.\nWhen the switch 74 or the switch $2 is closed, the\ndiode bridge 63 rectifies the current drawn by the load 73.\nThe rectified load current flows through the control wind-\n\na\n\n3,365,657\n\nh g s 48, 58 and causes the lagging current drawn by the\ntransformer to increase. By properly adjusting the trimming resistor 88, the increase in the lagging current can\nbe made to track the leading current caused by the capacitive load 73 with a net result of a power factor close\nto 1.0 as viewed from the transistors 24, 34. If both\nswitches 74 and 82 are closed and the leading current\nthrough the load increases, the current through the control windings 48, 58 will once again increase, increasing\nthe lagging current drawn by the transformer which cornpensates for the increased leading current through the\nload. Thus, with a leading load current, the control current can be adjusted such that the total current (vector\nsum) in the windings 46, S6 is in phase with the voltage\nacross it, which, in effect, presents a unity power factor\nto the transistors 24, 34.\nReferring now to FIG. 2, there is shown an alternative\ntransformer configuration, which is functiona!ly identical\nto the output transformer 44, 54 of FIG. 1 and is used to\nachieve the same results. The embodiment of FIG, 2\ndiffers only in that one core 89 of magnetic material is\nused instead of two separate cores. The input windings 46,\n56 are connected in parallel, and the output windings 52,\n62 are connected in series. The control windings 48, 58\nof FIG. 2 are replaced by a single control winding 90.\nThe magnetic flux, produced by the primary windings, follows the outside legs of the core. No net flux flows into\nthe center leg of the core where the control winding 90\nis placed due to the flux cancellation in the center core,\nwhich prevents any induced voltage in the control winding\n9%\nWhen D.C. current flows into the control winding 90,\nthe flux generated follows the center leg and travels around\nthe outside legs. The D.C. flux in the outside core legs\ncontrols the incremental core permeability and, therefore,\nthe self-inductance.\nReferring now to FIG. 3, there is shown an alternative\nembodiment of the device of FIG. 1 wherein a load 102 of\nFIG. 3 is inductive and thus produces a lagging current.\nThe load 102 is schematically illustrated as a pair of\nparallel paths. The first path comprises a switch 104, an\ninductor 106, and a resistor 108 connected in series, and\nthe second parallel path comprises a switch 112, an inductor 114, and a resistor 116 connected in series. A\ncapacitor 118 is connected across the output windings 52,\n62. Further, a second control winding 122 is added to\nthe first output transformer 44, and a second control\nwinding 124 is added to the second output transformer 54.\nOne side of the control winding 124 is connected to\nground, and the other side of the control winding 124 is\nconnected to one side of the control winding 122. The\nother side of the control winding 122 is connected through\na variable resistor 126 to a Positive source of power\nsupply.\nIn the embodiment of FIG. 3, in addition to a control\ncurrent produced by the diode bridge 63 through the control windings 48, 58, a bias current is produced by the\nwindings 122, 124. Adjustment of the resistor 126 produces a fixed bias current through the windings 122, 124,\nwhich saturates the transformer and results in a low selfinductance. The capacitor 118 across the windings 52, 62\nis chosen SO that with zero control current, the lagging\ncurrent, due to the transformers, is compensated for by\na leading current due to the capacitor 118. Upon closure\nof the switches 104 and 112, the control current produced\nby the rectifier bridge 63 produces a flux, which subtracts\nfrom the bias flux through the windings 122, 124 resulting\nin an increased self-inductance. As the lagging current due\nto the load is increased, the lagging current due to the\ntransformer is decreased because of the increased selfinductance of the transformer. Thus, a near unity power\nfactor load as seen by the trmsistors 24, 34 is obtained.\nReferring now to FIG. 4, there is shown an alternative\nembodiment of the invention wherein a feedback control\nCirCLlit Call COrreCt for a nOn-Unily power factor due lo a\n\n4\nvariable reactive load. A feedback signal, which is\nproportional to the phase difference between the voltage\nand current at the input side of a pair of output transformers 132, 134, is fed back through the control winding\n5 of each of the transformers 132, 134. The transformer\n132 comprises an input winding 136, a control winding\n138, and an output winding 142. The transformer 134\ncomprises an input winding 144, a control winding 146,\nand an output winding 148. Connected between the\nemitter 32 and one side of the input winding 136 and\none side of the input winding 144 is a resistor 152. Connected between the emitter 42 and the other side of input\nwinding 136 and the other side of the input winding 144\nis a resistor 154.\n15 A transformer 156 has its primary winding connected\nacross the resistor 152, and a transformer 158 has its\nprimary winding connected across the resistor 154. The\nsecondary winding of the transformer 156 and the\nsecondary winding of the transformer 158 are connected\n20 together on one side thereof, the other side thereof each\nbeing an input to a pair of terminals of a phase detector 162.\nAlso Connected to the phase detector 162 at two other\ninput terminals are a pair of leads connected across the\n25 parallel connected input windings 136, 144. The output\nof the phase detector is fed into the input of a D.C.\namplifier 172. The output of the D.C. amplifier 172 is\ncoupled to one side of the control winding 138, the other\nside o\xe2\x82\xac the control winding 138 being connected to one\n30 side of the control winding 146, and the other side of the\ncontrol winding 146 being connected to ground. A\ncapacitor 174 is connected in parallel across the series\nconnected output windings 142, 148. A load 176 is also\nconnected in parallel across the output windings 142, 148.\n35\nIn the embodiment of FIG. 4,the current supplied by\nthe transistors 24, 34, which, in effect, is the current\nthrough the resistor 152 and the resistor 154, is sampled\nby the transformer 156 and the transformer 158, respectively, and fed as one input to the phase detector 162.\n40 The other input to the phase detector is the voltage\nacross the parallel connected input windings 136, 144.\nSince the transformer 132 and the transformer 134 are\ndriven push-pull, the current must be sampled on both\nsides. The phase detector generates an error signal\n45 proportional to the angular difference between the\nvoltage and current sampled.\nThe error signal is amplified by the D.C. amplifier 172,\nand a control current developed in the control windings\n138, 146. The control current will adjust the self-induct60 ance so as to drive the phase angle between the voltage\nand current being sampled to zero. Since the control\nwinding only reduces the self-inductance of the transformers, capacitor 174, which is connected across the\nseries connected windings 142, 148, is chosen so that the\n55 leading current, due to the capacitor alone, will be\ngreater than the maximum lagging current that can be\nexpected due to an inductive reactive load.\nIt should be further understood that the foregoing\ndisclosure relates only to preferred embodiments of the\n80 invention, and that it is intended to cover all changes\nand modifications of the examples of the invention herein\nchosen for the purpose o the disclosure which do not\nf\nconstitute deparatures from the spirit and Scope of the\ninvention.\n65\nWhat is claimed and desired to be secured by Letters\nPatent is:\n1.
