Because of this, standard asymptotic and perturbation methods are ill-suited to these problems. In the present paper, a new method of analyzing jump phenomena is proposed. The principal feature of the method is the representation of the response in terms of rational functions. For illustration, the method is applied to the snap buckling of an elastic arch and to a simple combustion problem.", "title": "A new asymptotic method for jump phenomena", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-11T03:13:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19810031188, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Reiss, E.
