First, a filter initialization scheme is presented which allows the no-fail filter (NFF) states to be initialized using the first iteration of the flight data. A modified failure isolation strategy, compatible with the new failure detection strategy reported earlier, is discussed and the performance of the new FDI algorithm is analyzed using flight recorded data from the NASA ATOPS B-737 aircraft in a Microwave Landing System (MLS) environment. The results show that low level MLS, IMU, and IAS sensor failures are detected and isolated instantaneously, while accelerometer and rate gyro failures continue to take comparatively longer to detect and isolate. The parallel implementation is accomplished by partitioning the FINDS algorithm into two parts: one based on the translational dynamics and the other based on the rotational kinematics. Finally, a multi-rate implementation of the algorithm is presented yielding significantly low execution times with acceptable estimation and FDI performance.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19870014184, "id": "b54cc521907e4f10acd08546c8a48202", "publicationDate": "1987-04-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19870014184.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19870014184/downloads/19870014184.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19870014184/downloads/19870014184.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19870014184/downloads/19870014184.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
