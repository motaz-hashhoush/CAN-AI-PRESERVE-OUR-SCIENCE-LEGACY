The tasks for the extended study were as follows: (1) Define an interface between the Electrodynamic Tether System (ETS) and the Space Station (SS); (2) Identify growth paths for the 100 kW ETS defined in the original study to a 200 kW level of performance; (3) Quantify orbit perturbations caused by cyclic day/night operations of a Plasma Motor/Generator (PMG) on the SS and explore methods of minimizing these effects; (4) Define the analyses, precursor technology, ground tests, and precursor demonstrations leading up to a demonstration mission for an electrodynamic tether system that would be capable of producing maneuvering thrust levels of 25 newtons; and (5) Propose a development schedule for the demonstration mission and preliminary cost estimates.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19890005791, "id": "761b345493184be0a94f77ea5eab85e8", "publicationDate": "1988-09-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19890005791.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19890005791/downloads/19890005791.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19890005791/downloads/19890005791.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19890005791/downloads/19890005791.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
