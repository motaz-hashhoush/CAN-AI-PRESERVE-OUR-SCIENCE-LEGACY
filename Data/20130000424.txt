b'OPEN ROTOR AEROACOUSTIC MODELING\nABSTRACT\nOwing to their inherent fuel efficiency, there is renewed interest in developing open\nrotor propulsion systems that are both efficient and quiet. The major contributor to the\noverall noise of an open rotor system is the propulsor noise, which is produced as a result\nof the interaction of the airstream with the counter-rotating blades. As such, robust\naeroacoustic prediction methods are an essential ingredient in any approach to\ndesigning low-noise open rotor systems. To that end, an effort has been underway at\nNASA to assess current open rotor noise prediction tools and develop new capabilities.\nUnder this effort, high-fidelity aerodynamic simulations of a benchmark open rotor blade\nset were carried out and used to make noise predictions via existing NASA open rotor\nnoise prediction codes. The results have been compared with the aerodynamic and\nacoustic data that were acquired for this benchmark open rotor blade set. The\nemphasis of this paper is on providing a summary of recent results from a NASA Glenn\neffort to validate an in-house open noise prediction code called LINPROP which is\nbased on a high-blade-count asymptotic approximation to the Ffowcs-Williams\nHawkings Equation. The results suggest that while predicting the absolute levels may be\ndifficult, the noise trends are reasonably well predicted by this approach.\n\n1\n\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration\n\nOPEN ROTOR AEROACOUSTIC MODELING\nEd Envia\n\nNASA Glenn Research Center\n\nCMFF\xe2\x80\x9912\nBudapest, Hungary\nSeptember 4-7, 2012\n\nThis work has been sponsored by\nthe Subsonic Fixed Wing Project.\n\nwww.nasa.gov\n\nOutline\n\xef\x81\xb6 Background\n\n\xef\x81\xb6 Focus of This Work\n\xef\x81\xb6 Technical Approach\n\xef\x81\xb6 Representative Results\n\xef\x81\xb6 Conclusions & Recommendations\n\n3\n\nWhy Open Rotors?\n\nOpen Rotor Model in\nNASA Wind Tunnel (1985)\n\nGE UDF Engine\non MD-80 Aircraft (1987)\n\nPW/Allison 578-DX Engine\non MD-80 Aircraft (1989)\n\n\xef\x81\xb6 Due to their high propulsive efficiency, open rotors have a significant\nfuel efficiency advantage over conventional turbofans.\n\xef\x81\xb6 The feasibility of open rotor technology was demonstrated in the\n1980\xe2\x80\x99s, but performance compromises were made to meet the noise\nregulations of the time.\n\xef\x81\xb6 Changes to the design paradigm (e.g., blade count increase and tip\nspeed reduction) and improved 3D aerodynamic design tools have\nmade possible open rotor systems than can meet the current (more\nstringent) noise rules while maintaining their fuel burn advantage.\n\n4\n\nCurrent Open Rotor Research\n\nU.S.\n\nEurope\n\n\xef\x81\xb6 There is renewed research in both U.S. and Europe, through\ngovernment and industry partnerships, for developing open\nrotor propulsion systems that are competitive with modern\nturbofan engines.\n5\n\nNASA Research\n\xef\x81\xb6 One of NASA\xe2\x80\x99s objectives has been to assess the current\nprediction capability for aero/acoustic performance of open\nrotors. The testbed for this activity is a baseline GE blade set\ncalled F31/A31 for which significant amount of aerodynamic\nand acoustic data was acquired in model scale tests.\n\xef\x81\xb6 F31/A31 is a vintage 1990s design which has 12 blades on the\nfront rotor and 10 blades on the aft rotor. It was tested in both\nlow-speed regime (representative of approach and takeoff\nconditions) and high-speed regime (representative of climb\nand cruise conditions). Uninstalled as well as installed\nconfigurations were tested.\n\xef\x81\xb6 The focus of this presentation is on a subset of the low-speed\ntests for which the tip speed was varied, but the blade setting\nangles and tunnel Mach number were held fixed.\n6\n\nF31/A31 Wind Tunnel Data\nEx.

This is most often done by separating the two\nscales through linearization of the equations of motion.\n\xef\x81\xb6 The bulk of existing prediction capability does in fact rely on\nlinearized methods.

Cause is likely related to imperfections in blade manufacture and\ninstallation which destroy the perfect phase relationships assumed in the theory. 17\n\nData-Theory Comparisons (Tone Directivity)\n\n140o\n\n18o\n\nBasic trends are predicted, but not the absolute\nlevels. The predicted fall off of rotor tone\ndirectivities is consistent with single rotation\ndata. It is not clear why would the measured\ntone directivities level off or roll up at far\nupstream and far downstream angles.\n\n18\n\nData-Theory Comparisons w. Tip Speed\n\nData-theory comparisons for the overall sound pressure level (OASPL) are\nreasonable for high tip speed conditions, but deteriorate at lower tip speeds.\n\n19\n\nConclusions\n\xef\x81\xb6 An assessment of open rotor noise prediction capability is being\nconducted at NASA using detailed wind tunnel aerodynamic and\nacoustic data for a benchmark open rotor blade set.\n\xef\x81\xb6 Data-theory comparisons in the low speed regime indicate that, while\nbasic noise trends can be reasonably well captured, the absolute\nacoustic levels cannot be reliably and consistently predicted.\n\xef\x81\xb6 The cause is likely related to the assumption made both in the\naerodynamic and acoustic models that the blades in each rotor disc\nare identical and that they experience identical time histories that are\nspatially and temporally shifted from those of the reference blade.\n\xef\x81\xb6 In reality, there are manufacturing and installation differences\nbetween blades which destroy the perfect phase relationships\nassumed in the theory and lead to the distribution of acoustic energy\nin all shaft orders not just the ones predicted by the theory.\n\n20\n\nRecommendations\n\xef\x81\xb6 Therefore, to improve the absolute level prediction capability, it\nwould be necessary to modify the aerodynamic and acoustic\ntheoretical models to account for these blade-to-blade differences\nin a manner consistent with reality.\n\xef\x81\xb6 As such, it would be useful to experimentally measure these\ndifferences and quantify the impact of the blade variations on the\naerodynamic and acoustic responses of the blades.\n\xef\x81\xb6 If that proves too difficult a task, it may be possible to conduct\ntheoretical parametric studies in which prescribed blade-to-blade\nvariations (both in geometry and aerodynamic response) are\nintroduced and the sensitivity of the resulting acoustic field to these\nvariations is established.\n\xef\x81\xb6 These results could then serve as guides for modifying the\ntheoretical models to correctly account for the real blade effects.\n\n21\n\nQuestions?\n\n22\n\n'
