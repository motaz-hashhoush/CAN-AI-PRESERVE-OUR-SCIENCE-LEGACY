The\nrollout environment is is rich with forced harmonics and higher order effects can be used for\nextracting structural dynamics information. To enable this utilization, processing tools are needed\nto move from measured and analytical data to dynamic metrics such as transfer functions, mode\nshapes, modal frequencies, and damping. This paper covers the range of systems and tests that are\navailable to estimate rollout forcing functions for the Space Launch System (SLS). The specific\ninformation covered in this paper includes: the different definitions of rollout forcing functions; the\noperational and developmental data sets that are available; the suite of analytical processes that are\ncurrently in-place or in-development; and the plans and future work underway to solve two\nimmediate problems related to rollout forcing functions. Problem 1 involves estimating enforced\naccelerations to drive finite element models for developing design requirements for the SLS class of\nlaunch vehicles. Problem 2 involves processing rollout measured data in near real time to understand\nstructural dynamics properties of a specific vehicle and the class to which it belongs.\nNomenclature\nNASA\nCT\nSLS\nML\nSWAT\nDOF\nMLP\nFEM\nJEL\ng\nmph\nCxP\nSRB\nSTS\nDRT\nin\nHz\nt\n\xcf\x89\nFRF(\xcf\x89)\nIFT\npsi\nRHS\nLHS\nCLA\n\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration\nCrawler Transporter\nSpace Launch System\nMobile Launcher\nSum of Weighted Accelerations Technique\nDegree Of Freedom\nMobile Launch Platform\nFinite Element Model\nJacking, Elevation, and Leveling\nacceleration due to gravity\nmiles per hour\nConstellation Program\nSolid Rocket Booster\nSpace Transportation System\nDynamic Rollout Test\ninch\nHertz or cycles per second\ntime variable, seconds\nfrequency variable, Hz or cycles per second\nfrequency response function (used synonymously with TF)\ninverse Fourier transform\npounds per square inch\nright hand side (when facing page)\nleft hand side (when facing page)\ncoupled loads analysis\n1\n\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\n11/21/16\n\nIntroduction\n\nM\n\najor NASA manned vehicles have made the final transportation to the launch pad via a significant track/tread\nbased system called the Crawler-Transporter or CT. Figure 1 depicts the Space Launch System (SLS)\nvehicle and the associated Mobile Launcher (ML) under transport to the launch site using this system. This \xe2\x80\x9cRollout\xe2\x80\x9d\nevent has been found to produce structural and fatigue loads on large flexible launch vehicles and spacecraft.\nAlternatively, there is a potential to use the resultant rollout loading to exercise the vehicle for structural diagnostics\nand model correlation. These two situations (induced loads and operational diagnostics) are the two drivers for the\ncurrent effort. Hence, this paper addresses current work to understand and reproduce the rollout forcing functions to\nallow refined predictions for the Space Launch System (SLS) vehicle and Mobile Launcher (ML) as well as to enable\nthe use of the vehicle response and analytical predictions for comparisons and validation.\n\nFigure 1. Artist Conception of the Space Launch System (SLS) and Mobile Launcher (ML) on the\nCrawler-Transporter (CT) (from http://www.nasa.gov)\nRollout forcing functions are generated as the CT imposes a series of harmonic excitations (sine and cosine-like\nwaveforms) onto the entire system under transport. Previous work during rollout of the Space Shuttle system found\ntwo primary families of harmonics, which are characterized by a speed-dependent harmonic load and integer\nfrequency superharmonics1,4. This loading is inherent in the tracked vehicle design of the CT and the frequency\ncontent is directly tied to the speed of the CT. Vehicle response can significantly increase when one of these harmonic\nforcing function harmonics is at or near one of the resonant frequencies of the vehicle. Figure 2 shows a Campbell\ndiagram (harmonic frequency content vs. rollout speed) showing the possible interactions between the forcing function\nharmonics and the vehicle models of the Space Shuttle vehicle. The two families of harmonics are listed as the .59\nfamily and the .975 family. Figure 3 shows one of the eight CT Tracked drive systems with the hardware dimensions\n2\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\n11/21/16\nthat are related to these two harmonic families of the forcing functions. The .98 family is related to the 18 inch spacing\nbetween each of the 57 shoes in a track. The .59 famility is related to the 30 inch distance between the rollers that\nsupport the entire system and allow it transverse across the tracks.\n\nFigure 2. Harmonic Frequencies of the Space Shuttle era Rollout Forcing Functions vs. CT Speed\n\nTruck\n\nTrack\n\nFigure 3. Enforced Displacement Estimate based on the Roller Track Contact Model\nIn previous Shuttle-era work on the rollout forcing functions, the primary effort was to avoid speed ranges that caused\nundesired loading events1,4-8. Hence, this historical work has formed a useful basis for initiating the current effort but\nwas not driven by the same high-fidelity need to understand the forcing functions as the current work. Previously, the\nforcing functions were estimated using a modification of the Sandia National Laboratories-developed Sum of\nWeighted Accelerations Technique (SWAT)1,2,3. The modifications to SWAT resulted in a hybrid approach that used\nthe mode shapes of the structural model to estimate weighting parameters, which operated on measured accelerations.\nEstimated six Degrees-Of-Freedom (DOF) forces then drove a free-free model of the Shuttle vehicle and Mobile\nLaunch Platform (MLP) at the center-of-mass. The actual CT was not modelled in this work. The resulting functions\nwere then adjusted to simulate unmeasured roll-out speeds. This process allowed the dynamic model of the structure\n3\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\n11/21/16\nto be used to estimate the response at a wider range of speeds than the measured data-base. The problems with this\napproach are the reliance on a center-of-mass input point, a limited frequency range constrained by the number of\nmeasurement locations, the reliance on the analytical Finite Element Model (FEM) of the vehicle, and the lack of\ndirect CT data in the process. Post-Shuttle work with the Ares I-X vehicle highlighted the potential uses of the\nexpanded Shuttle-era data to estimate rollout forcing functions9. More recently, the need for a high-fidelity\nunderstanding of the rollout environment to service the SLS needs requires that a forcing function estimation process\nbe developed which reduces the impact on these historical shortcomings and builds on the most recent work to\nunderstand and model this phenomena10. This paper covers the efforts underway to develop such a higher fidelity\nunderstanding of the rollout forcing functions in order to estimate induced loads and perform operational diagnostics.\n\nDescription of Rollout Hardware\nThere are multiple definitions for the term \xe2\x80\x9cforcing functions\xe2\x80\x9d. However, in order to understand these different\ndefinitions, it is necessary to define the different hardware components of the CT and Launch Platforms. The insert\nof Figure 3 shows four of the 57 shoes that make up the track in contact with the ground. Two of the 11 rollers per\ntrack are barely visible but the locations are clearly understood based on the circular access covers. The primary\nimage of Figure 3 shows the signcant structural member (called the truck) that holds a pair of tracks with 11 rollers\nper side of each truck. Each of the four trucks has a Jacking, Elevation, and Levelling (JEL) and a guide tube system\nto properly support the CT chassis and the payload (launch platform and launch vehicle) as well as four electric track\nmotors to provide motive force. The guide tube transfers all lateral loads from the CT chassis, the launch platform,\nand the launch vehicle into each of the four trucks. Figure 4 shows a schematic of a CT truck with the tracks, track\nmotors, and guide tube marked.\n\nFigure 4. Schematic of CT Truck Showing the Guide Tube to Support Lateral Loads\nAll axial forces that are generated in the process of enableing the CT trucks to support the CT chassis, launch platform,\nand launch vehicle are carried via the JEL systems. Each truck has four hydraulic cylinders that compromise the JEL\nsystem. The variability of the JEL system allows the CT to carry variable weight payloads, to handle uneven weight\ndispersions, to lift and lower the payload, and to level the payload even when moving up or down the ramp at the pad.\nThe CT chassis provides the structural framework to connect and control/steer all four trucks as well as interface to\nthe launch platform. Also the chassis contains the diesel motors that drive the generators for motive and auxiliary\npower. The chassis contains the hydraulic systems for the JEL and steering functions. And finally all control\ninterfaces to allow operation of the CT are housed in the chassis. Figure 5 shows a schematic and a photo showing\n4\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\n11/21/16\nthe location and configuration of the JEL system on each truck, as well as the CT chassis. Also note that one of the\nfour Launch Platform support points is denoted in Figure 5. There is a pickup point for the launch platform at the\ncenter of each JEL cylinder set on each truck.\n\nFigure 5. Schematic and Photos of CT Jacking, Elevation, and Leveling (JEL) Systems and Chassis\nThere have been three launch platforms that have developed for four primary payloads (by weight) for the CT during\nthe scope of the work described herein. Additionally, there were earlier launch platforms for the Apollo/Saturn launch\nvehicles but data from those programs has not been carried forward into the current efforts. The Space Shuttle and\nthe Ares1-X9 vehicles used the Shuttle Mobile launch Platform (MLP). This platform weighed 8.2 million pounds\nand is easily recognized due to the lack of a launch tower 11. There was a 9.5 million pound launch platform built\nspecifically for the cancelled Constellation Program (CxP) that was called a Mobile Launcher (ML)12. This platform\nwill be referred to as the CxP ML. The CxP ML was rebuilt to generate the ML for the Space Launch System (SLS)\nvehicle. This 10.5 million pound platform will be referred to as the SLS ML13. Figure 6 shows each of these platforms\nduring transport by the CT. Note that the SLS ML is a conceptual image as an SLS vehicle has not been mounted on\nthe SLS ML as of this writing.\n\nFigure 6. Space Shuttle, Constellation, and Space Launch System Launch Platforms\n\nDefinitions of Rollout Forcing Functions\nThe next critical information needed for this work is to describe the different ways to define and provide \xe2\x80\x9cforcing\nfunctions\xe2\x80\x9d. Historically multiple definitions have been used to define rollout forcing functions and the defined\nproducts of the current work continue that trend. Fundamentally the current level of understanding actually requires\n5\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\n11/21/16\nthat the rollout forcing functions be assessed from multiple vantage points (hence using different definitions) to\novercome the lack of complete data sets. This section covers these different definitions or vantage points).\nInput Forces\nThe most obvious definition of \xe2\x80\x9cforcing functions\xe2\x80\x9d are input forces (units of pounds force or Newtons) that drive the\nsystem. With the systems under consideration here, these inputs may be defined at any of several interfaces: the\nforward motive force provided by each CT truck; the ground/shoe interface at each track; the truck roller to track shoe\ninterface; the gross truck force inputs to the JEL and guide tube systems, the actual forces generated by each truck\xe2\x80\x99s\nJEL and guide tube systems, the forces acting at the four CT to launch platform interfaces on the chassis, or the various\ninterfaces between the launch platform and launch vehicle. Each of these different input force defintions have different\nadvantages and disadvantages and require synchronizing the definition of the system of interest as well. As the\ninterface used for force definition moves away from the control inputs and toward the actual launch vehicle, more of\nthe system has to be used in defining the force and less is used to define the system. In general, it becomes harder to\ninstrument or estimate the more basic low level forces very close to the control or ground inputs but it becomes harder\nto interprete the forces transmitted through more structure. As will be discussed later, the current efforts are enhanced\nby the fact that models of the CT are now available.\nThe historical Shuttle work performed previously was primarily focused on estimating forces at the CT/MLP interface\n(using the center-of-mass as a surrogate input point)1 or the MLP/Launch Vehicle interface7; although there were\nlimited efforts to utilize forces generated by the JEL systems5. Input forces were chosen for the original Shuttle work\nto allow inputs to the models to be defined in such a manner as to allow the data to be shifted to estimate vehicle\nresponse at rollout speeds that were not measured. In this way, a rollout speed could be chosen that reduced the fatigue\nloads on the flight vehicle1. From this experience, it is clear that the primary advantage of the input force definition\nis that the resulting forces are basic quantities (i.e. less affected bystructural dynamics), which can potentially be\nmodified for unmeasured systems or operating enviornments. However, the disadvantage is that measurement or\nestimation of the forces are more difficult than other assumed forcing function definitions.\nInput Accelerations\nThe most common approach to define rollout forcing functions are as input accelerations (units of meters per second\nsquared, inches per second squared, or the non-dimensional units of g\xe2\x80\x99s)9. The Shuttle rollout work before 2000 was\nall based on driving a model of the Shuttle vehicle and MLP with measured accelerations from operational rollouts.\nThis operational reliance on measured acclerations driving such a system continued to the end of the Shuttle Program8.\nAs a result of the operational and developmental efforts, there is a significant Shuttle-era database of input\naccelerations available. This database can enable acceleration inputs to be defined at any of three interfaces: the inputs\nto the JEL system, the inputs to the launch platform, and the inputs to the vehicle. In fact, this acceleration data is\ncontinuing to define the rollout loads and rollout operations for the SLS system. The Shuttle, Ares1-X, and SLS\nvehicles analyses have used this acceleration database at the CT/launch platform interface to estimate rollout loads.\nThe advantage of using input accelerations is that measurements can easily be obtained using accelerometers at the\ndesired interfaces. The disadvantage is that those measurements become strongly tied to the actual system and\noperating conditions under test due to sensitivity to the payload structural dynamics. One of the primary tasks of the\ncurrent effort is to develop CT/MLP interface acclerations that are appropriate for SLS-era systems (CT, ML, and\nlaunch vehicle) such that the current Shuttle-era input acceleration database can be assessed for conservatism. For\nthis work, analyses and data at other forcing function interfaces will need to be used to handle dynamic sensitivities.\nInput Displacements\nAn alternative definition of the forcing function that is currently being studied are displacements. A displacement\nforcing function only makes sense for low motion areas of the structure that are likely to be unaffected by structural\ndynamics such as at the shoe/ground interface of the roller/shoe interface. Displacements are not be as easy to measure\nas accelerations but are proving to be more stable and easier to estimate than forces. However, there are technical\nchallenges to overcome in developing appropriate displacement forcing functions at the base interfaces meantioned\nearlier. One driver of these issues are the large number of input locations to be covered. There are 11 rollers per track\nand two tracks per truck and 4 trucks on the CT for a total of 88 rollers on the system. If three DOFs per roller are\nassumed, then there are 264 displacement time histories needed to drive the system.\n\n6\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\n11/21/16\nIndirect Measurements\nAnother alternate definition of forcing function is that of indirect measurements. These would be measurements that\nare indirectly related to input foces. The examples include electrical currents feeding propulsion motors, tachnometer\noutputs from propulsion motors, JEL system pressures, guide tube strains and hold down post strains at the launch\nvehicle interface. Past work has been performed to process hold down post strains to directly drive a model of the\nlaunch vehicle7 or as a supplemental input to other measurements14. These indirect meausrements are proving useful\nto supplement other incomplete measurements.\n\nMeasured Data Available for Rollout Forcing Functions\nThe second critical input needed to provide rollout forcing functions for the two products mentioned earlier are to\nunderstand what measured data sets are available. This section provides an overview of the data that is available for\nthis work.\nCT-Only(Shuttle)\nA series of instrumented rolls of the CT were performed in 2005. The system was operated at .5, .6., .7, .75, .8, and\n.9 miles per hour. There was also a data take covering a speed sweep of of this same speed range. The CT was\ninstrumented with triaxial accelerometers mounted at 9 locations, JEL system pressure transducers, and a tachometer\nspeed sensor on one of the 16 propulsion motors. The configuration is the same as that seen in Figure 5.\nCT-Only(SLS)\nOne of the CTs was structurally modified to handle the larger weight of the SLS stack and ML. As of this writing\nthere are discussions underway to perform a series of dedicated tests in 2017 at several speeds and with a similar\nsensor set to the Shuttle-era tests. There are also discussions underway to add guide tube strains to the sensor suite,\nwhich would allow an estimate of lateral forces between the CT trucks and the CT chassis. The configuration would\nalso be similar that seen in Figure 5.\nMLP+CT(Shuttle)\nThe CT loaded with an empty MLP was also subjected to a series of rollout tests in 2005. The system was operated\nat 0.0, .5, .6., .7, .8, and .9 miles per hour. There were 9 CT triaxial accelerometer locations, 12 MLP triaxial\naccelerometer locations, JEL system pressure transducers, wind speed, wind direction, and a tachometer speed sensor\non one of the 16 propulsion motors. The configuration is the same as that seen in Figure 6.\nMLP+CT(SLS)\nThere are currently discussions to perform rollout testing with the upgraded CT loaded with an empty MLP in 2017.\nThe system would be operated at multiple speeds. The CT would be instrumented similar to the 2005 test but the\nMLP would be unistrumented. The configuration is the same as that seen in Figure 6.\nML(CxP)+CT(Shuttle)\nIn 2011, there was an instrumented roll with the Constellation (CxP) ML. This ML was similar to the current SLS\nversion of the ML with a significant launch tower. The CT was instrumented as was the previous Shuttle-era tests\nwith additional instruments on the ML. This is an important data set as it is transitional between the Shuttle and SLS\ngenerations of hardware. An image of the test is shown in Figure 7. Another interesting aspect of this test is that\nsome of the highest instrumented rollout speeds were captured during this test. Efforts are currently underway to\nrecover this data from archival sources.\nML(SLS)+CT(SLS)\nThere are plans to roll the current SLS ML to the pad using the upgraded SLS version of the CT in 2017. Discussions\nand planning are underway to instrument the CT and the ML during this activity. Furthermore, discussions are\nunderway to assess the ability to roll at different speeds for dedicated data takes. The configuration would be the SLS\nML with tower as in the righthand image of Figure 6 but without the SLS launch vehicle.\nAres I-X+MLP+CT(Shuttle)\nThe AresI-X vehicle rollout to the pad in 2009 was instrumented with CT accels and four accelerometers on the MLP\nand a single triaxial accelerometer set on the vehicle. There were also four strain measurements at the MLP to vehicle\ninterface (one per hold-down post). The rollout configuration is seen in Figure 7.\n7\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\n11/21/16\n\nFigure 7. Ares I-X, Shuttle Partial Stack, and Shuttle STS-115 Rollouts\nShuttle Partial Stack+ MLP+CT(Shuttle)\nThe Shuttle partial stack consisted of a pair of Solid Rocket Boosters (SRBs) and a connecting crossbeam that was a\nmajor structural component of the External Tank. This configuration was used for a significant round of rollout testing\nin 2003. The CT sensor suite mentioned previously was used as well as 14 triaxial accelerometer packages on the\nMLP and three triaxial accelerometer locations on each SRB. There were also four strain measurements at each MLP\nto SRB interface (one per hold-down post) as well as diagnostic video imagery. This test series contained the most\ndetailed range of speeds recorded to-date. This configuration is seen in the middle of Figure 7.\nSTS-115+MLP+CT(Shuttle)\nThe Shuttle stack configured for the STS-115 launch was instrumented to acquire data for verifying the rollout fatigue\nloads and operational speeds. Data from several speeds were obtained during the roll to the pad. The standard suite\nof CT accels, pressures, and speed were acquired. Nine accelerometers were mounted on each SRB. The body of the\nMLP had 12 triax accelerometer locations with an additional eight triax locations at the MLP/SRB interfaces. The\nOrbiter had 13 triax accelerometer locations on the structure plus another 10 triax locations on the Space Shuttle Main\nEngines (SSMEs). There were additional strain measurements on the vehicle as well. The STS-115 configuration is\nseen in Figure 7. It should be noted that several additional Shuttle rollouts were also instrumented with a more limited\nset of sensors but none have provided the utility of the STS-115 test.\nSLS+ML(SLS)+CT(SLS)\nOne of the primary targets for the work reported in this paper is to support an instrumented roll to the pad with the full\nSTS stack in 2018. This test has been named the Dynamic Rollout Test or DRT. The configuration is represented in\nFigures 1 and 6. A significant instrumentation suite and multiple speeds are under discussion for implementation.\nThe DRT is unique in that it has the potential to partially mitigate the inability to test the entire launch vehicle in a\ntraditional modal test.\n\nAnalytical Data Available for Rollout Forcing Functions\nA third critical input to this work is an understanding of the analytical data that is (or can expected to be) available.\nThis section provides an overview of the different analytical data classes that are being used to consolidate the different\ndefinitions of \xe2\x80\x9cforcing function\xe2\x80\x9d and combine the different measured data sets to allow (1) assessment (and delivery\nif necessary) of current rollout forcing functions and (2) development of a process to analyze DRT rollout data for\ncorrelation and diagnostics.\n\n8\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\n11/21/16\nStructural Dynamic Finite Element Models\nThe ability to perform modal and transient structural dynamics analysis via Finite Element Models (FEMs) is one of\nthe most useful analytical tools to support the development and assessment of forcing functions. Currently FEM\nmodels exist for all of the major components (launch vehicle, launch platform, and CT) discussed in the previous\nsection except for the SLS version of the CT. However, several models need to be integrated to form the proper launch\nstack and some of the critical models still need to be validated. In fact, validation of the SLS versions of all three\ncomponent FEMs is one of the primary driving requirements behind this work. As an example, Figure 8 shows the\nmesh of the model of the Shuttle partial stack on an MLP with the model of the CT chassis. Figure 7 shows the actual\nstructure that is represented by the FEM.\n\nFigure 8. Shuttle Partial Stack Finite Element Model with MLP and CT Chassis\nIt should also be noted that the FEM representation can be necessary to enable other analytical results \xe2\x80\x93 as will be\nseen in the next set of analytical data (SWAT-estimated forces). However it has previously been mentioned that\ndirectly driving an FEM transient result with measured accelerations is the most commonly used manifestation of\nrollout forcing functions7,9. The first required product of this effort is to combine available measured data and\nanalytical data to validate input acceleration time histories to drive and FEM of a system that has not yet been tested.\nOne of the approaches to develop the necessary rools and understanding is to drive and FEM of the CT with\naccelerations measured as close to the interface as possible. The complications of this part of the work are that the\nFEM of the CT has not been fully validated and that stiffness between the ground/shoe/roller interfaces must still be\nestimated. Figure 9 shows an example of this work (top plot \xe2\x80\x93 time domain and bottom plot \xe2\x80\x93 frequency domain)\nusing data and FEM of the CT only while moving at .7 mph. This work is an early iteration that is being used to set\nthe spring to ground stiffness for three DOF at all 88 rollers. The noise in the results and the forced harmonic peaks\nare captured while an analytical offset is a indicative of the ongoing efforts to set the ground spring stiffnesses.\nPlatform/Vehicle C.G. Force Estimates\nPrevious Shuttle work estimated forces at the CT/MLP interface using data from the Partial Stack and STS-115 tests1.\nThese forces were estimated using a modification of the Sandia National Laboratories Sum of Weighted Accelerations\nTechnique (SWAT)2,3. In this technique, the forces at the Centrer of Gravity (C.G.) are estimated using a weighted\nsummation of measured acceleration as shown in equation (1).\n\nFCGi \xef\x80\xbd \xef\x81\xa6 i f (t ) \xef\x80\xbd mi aCGi \xef\x80\xbd mi wi a(t );\nT\n\nT\n\n(1)\n\nwhere FCGi are a matrix of the six time histories of forces and moments defined at the C.G.,\na(t) are a matrix of time histories of measured accelerations,\nmi are the rigid body mass properties defined at the C.G., and\nwTi are a matrix of calculated weighting parameters.\nThe weighting parameters are chosen to sum the measured accelerations to generate estimates for each of the six rigid\nbody accelerations of the C.G. In performing this weighting, the chosen elastic body generalized DOFs and all rigid\n9\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\n11/21/16\nbody generalized modes (except the single rigid body mode of interest) are zeroed out. This statement is effectively\nimplemented by choosing the weight matrix to vector multiply the elastic mode shapes to produce zero while unit\nnormalized via the rigid body shapes as depicted in equations (2) and (3).\n\n\xef\x81\x9bw\n\nT\n\n\xef\x81\x9d\n\n(2)\n\n\xef\x80\xbd \xef\x81\xa4 ik ;\n\n(3)\n\n\xef\x80\xaa \xef\x81\xa6 \xef\x80\xbd \xef\x81\x9b0\xef\x81\x9d;\n\nwhere \xcf\x95 are elastic mode shapes.\n\nwi \xef\x80\xaa \xef\x81\xa6\nT\n\nwhere\n\n\xef\x81\xa4 ik\n\nR\nik\n\nis the delta function which is only a non-zero value (1.0) if i = k, and\n\n\xcf\x95R are rigid body mode shapes.\nNote that references 1-3 contain more details on this approach.\nThere are multiple approaches to calculate the weight matrix from meansured data provided by the developers of the\napproach. However, for the previous Shuttle work, the SWAT approach had to be modified to use elastic mode\nshapes provided by the FEM of the system of interest. This experimental/analytical hybrid approach was necessary\nas it was not feasible to modal test the entire Shuttle rollout stack. The resulting forces were less affected by the\npresence of the elastic modes of the system when compared to the original meansured accelerations. As a result, the\nhybrid forces could be shifted approximate the forces expected form unmeansred rollout speeds. Figure 10 shows a\nresult form this work that included the estimated forces at a 1.00 mph rollout speed (top and bottom plots) and a\nforces predicted at a 1.04 mph rollout speed (middle and bottom plots). Although this approach was not generally\napplicable for more general analyses, the results showed the utility of choosing forcing functions with less\nsensitivity to the structural dynamics of the system.\n\nFigure 9. Enforced Acceleration FEM Solution in Vertical Direction at Center of CT Chassis\n10\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\n11/21/16\n\nFigure 10. Estimated Forces at Center-of-Mass of STS/MLP Stack for Two Speeds\nSynthetic Displacement Forcing Function\nAnother analytical dataset for developing rollout forcing functions are assumed displacements of the roller axles as\nmoving along the tracks and crossing shoes. Assumptions for the roller displacements were derived from knowledge\nof the hardware, assessments of response measurements, inputs and results from other analytical studies10, additional\nmeasurements roller/shoe/ground interactions15, and assumed relationships between the different displacement\ndirections/rollers. Figure 11 shows and an example of an assumed vetical displacement forcing function using a\ncontact model derived from hardware observations. Figure 12 provides an assumed vertical displacement based on\nan assumption all rollers on a truck are rigidly connected and responding to rigid body motions. In Figures 11 and 12,\nthe top plot contains the complete 1200 second assumed time history of the vertical direction of a lead roller as it\nmoves across the track at .7 mph. The middle plot shows an expanded view of only a few seconds of data. The bottom\nplot shows the same data in the frequency domain. It can be seen in Figure 11 that only the shoe spacing family of\nharmonics are present (peaks separated by .7 Hz) as each roller is assumed to act independently. The roller spacing\nfamily harmonics (peaks separated by .3 Hz) are seen in Figure 12 as the rollers rigidly interact with each other.\nHowever, the magnitudes of the roller spacing harmonics are significantly suppressed. These synthetic forcing\nfunctions are assessed by driving an FEM of the individual truck or the complete CT. Comparisons to measured data\nallow sensitivity studies and refinements to be performed. In general this analysis approach proved useful for\ndeveloping basic understanding and limiting the search space for follow-on techniques. The lesson learned was that\nthe shoe spacing family of harmonics were directly produced. However, the roller spacing family of harmonics were\nan indirect emergent effect. Hence, more refined analysis and data-derived approaches were found to be required to\nproduce forcing functions that capture the known physics.\n11\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\n11/21/16\n\nFigure 11. Synthetic Enforced Displacement Estimate Based on a Roller Track Contact Model\n\n.\nFigure 12. Synthetic Enforced Displacement Estimate Based on 11 Rigidly-Connected Rollers\n12\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\n11/21/16\nHarmonic Analysis\nThe presence of the two families of forced harmonics is a well established feature in all systems to date that have\nmeasurements while in CT-induced motion4. Furthermore, the relationship between the rollout speed and the\nfrequencies of these harmonics has been established for several years1. Therefore, another possible approach to\ngenerating a rollout forcing function is to impose this known harmonic content as a constraint. The approach used to\ndefine a set of basis functions containing sine and cosine functions at the known frequency as defined by the rollout\nspeed. These basis functions were fit to the measured accelerometer data and transferred to the forcing function via\nanalytical tools including the FEM of the CT and individual truck as well as other measurements sensitive to imposed\nforces (speed, JEL pressure, guide tube strain, truck acceleration). Equation 4 depicts the approximation of an\nacceleration time history as a summation of these harmonic basis functions.\n\xf0\x9d\x91\x9b\xe2\x84\x8e\n\xf0\x9d\x90\xb4(\xf0\x9d\x91\xa1) = \xe2\x88\x91 \xf0\x9d\x91\x96=1 \xf0\x9d\x91\x86 \xf0\x9d\x91\x96 \xf0\x9d\x91\xa0\xf0\x9d\x91\x96\xf0\x9d\x91\x9b(2\xf0\x9d\x9c\x8b\xf0\x9d\x91\x93\xf0\x9d\x91\x96 \xe2\x88\x97 \xf0\x9d\x91\xa1) + \xf0\x9d\x90\xb6 \xf0\x9d\x91\x96 \xf0\x9d\x91\x90\xf0\x9d\x91\x9c\xf0\x9d\x91\xa0(2\xf0\x9d\x9c\x8b\xf0\x9d\x91\x93\xf0\x9d\x91\x96 \xe2\x88\x97 \xf0\x9d\x91\xa1);\n\n(4)\n\n\xf0\x9d\x91\x86 \xf0\x9d\x91\x96 = sine coefficients for harmonic i,\n\xf0\x9d\x90\xb6 \xf0\x9d\x91\x96 = cosine coefficients for harmonic i,\nfi = frequency of ith harmonic = i * scale * speed0,\nt = time in seconds,\nscale = 17.6 * shoe spacing or 17.6 * roller spacing,\nspeed0 = mean speed of CT, and\nnh = total number of harmonic basis functions.\nFigure 13 shows and example of using this harmonic basis function approach to reconstruct an accelerometer time\nhistory from a verticle sensor on a truck below the JEL while the CT is unloaded and in motion at .7 mph. By taking\naccount of the measured speed drift and dither of the system while fitting the data in increments, a high-fidelity fit of\nthe entire time history is possible. Figure 13 shows the reconstruction and the data overlapping in the top plot. The\nmiddle plot shows the first 128 samples of data. Thre original and reconstructed traces are still largely\nindistinguishable. The bottom plot shows the requency-domain version of the data in the top plot. Note that the\nsynthesized data (blue) is chosen to only retain harmonic content up to 30 Hz. Also notice that much of the \xe2\x80\x9cnoise\xe2\x80\x9d\nin the system is effectively described via tracking and reproducing the measured speed variations.\nFigure 14 shows the magnitude of the sine (top plot) and cosine (bottom plot) parameters in the left hand side (while\nfacing the page) pair. The right hand side data shows the same parameters converted to amplitude (top plot) and phase\n(bottom plot). The amplitude plot (right hand side top) is especially informative as the relative size of the parameters\nfit to the data is readily seen. Also note that this data is normalized (phase and amplitude scaled from average values)\nto allow better visualization of the data. This harmonic analysis approach has been found most useful as a supporting\ntechnique to analyze and transform data in support of other techniques mentioned herein. One example of this was an\nexercise to use a a static FEM of a truck to transfer this harmonic representation of the measured acceleration to\ndisplacements at the rollers as estimated of displacement forcing functions. Figure 15 shows such an approximate\nverticle displacement time history as the middle roller of an inboard track. This example had displacements that are\napproximately 5 times larger than expected. This error could be due to two likely issues: a static rather than dynamic\nFEM to relate roller dynamics to meansured acceleration; and the presence of modal content in the data that would be\nmuch reduced in actual forcing functions.\nForce and Frequency Response Function\nAnother use of the harmonic analysis approach is to estimate a force time history acting on each truck by filtering\nmeasured data for the assumed harmonic content. A simplified assumption to exercise this approach is to assume that\nthe measured accelerations closest to the truck/ground interface are largely driven by forced harmonics not structural\ndynamics. There is also a reuirement to assume the mass that is being moved by the acceleration. To begin with an\nestimate of the global speed of the CT is estimated from the speed sensor or from the harmonic content of the\naccelerometer signal. Figure 16 shows such an estimate in the top plot using a moving average of a measured speed\nsignal from a .7mph roll of the CT. The middle plot contains a comparison to the original measured data. The bottom\nplot shows a comparison in the frequency domain. This estimated mean spead is then used to drive the harmonic fit\nof equation (4) to any of several measured data sets that might be highly enriched in forced data. Such data sets\ninclude the differential speed measurement, the pressure on the JEL system, the guide tube strains, or the truck\naccelerations closest to the ground. In this manner the signal can be enhanced in the harmonic content expected in the\nsensor signal as shown in the top plot and middle plot of Figure 17.\n13\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\n11/21/16\n\nFigure 13. Reconstruction of Vertical CT Accelerometer Trace Using Harmonic Basis Functions\n\nFigure 14. Sine and Cosine Parameters (LHS) and Converted to Amplitude and Phase (RHS)\n\n14\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\n11/21/16\n\nFigure 15. Roller Displacement Estimated from Acceleration Harmonic Basis Functions\nFor the example provided here, the harmonic filtered accelerometer signal is then multiplied by the mass of a truck to\nprovide a first order approximation of the force trace acting on the entire truck in the measured direction. This estimate\nis provided in Figure 18. The top plot contains the full time record of estimated force (assuming the entire truck is\nbeing accelerated). The middle plot contains a zoomed version of this trace and the bottom plot the frequency domain\nversion of the data. This force estimate as well as the first order forces in the other two directions are combined to the\nsame three estimated forces at the the other three trucks to provide 12 force time histories to estimate Frequency\nResponse Functions (FRFs). FRFs are a common mathematical respresentation of the dynamics of a system when\nsubjected to input and output measurements. The input is a below JEL system vertical acceleration measurement,\nwhile the output is a vertical measurement above the JEL system. Figure 19 provides two estimates of the FRF (middle\nand bottom plot) that are in theory suppressed in forced content and enhanced in sturctual dyanamics. The top plot is\nan estimate of coherence, which shows how the two measurements appear to be related to each other.\nFRFs hold great promise to allow an assessment of the underlying structural dynamics of a system, which would help\naddress the problems being addressed by this effort. One advantage is that the FRF can be estimated by averaging\nacross the length of the time histories of acquired data as well as across different operating speeds of the same\nvehicle/platform configuration. Another advantage is that the FRF can be used to implement frequency domain\ninverse techniques to estimate forcing functions15. Such generalized force estimation techniques can be used to\nconstrain the forcing function to drive the system at selected or known locations. And finally, the FRF has the potential\nto separate the structural dynamics from the forced dynamics. The disadvantage of such a frequency domain approach\nis that an estimate of the input forcing function is needed to generate the resulting FRF. As such, continuing efforts\nin force estimation techniques such as SWAT or Inverse Structural Filter are suggested 1,2,3,15. Alternatively, the\nforcing functions may need to be defined at locations where measurements exist, which can corrupt the input estimates\nwith system effects and make generalization other systems more difficult.\n15\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\n11/21/16\n\nFigure 16. Estimated Mean Speed From Moving Average Fit of Measured Speed\nMulti-Body Dynamics Analysis\nThe most refined analysis work currently underway involves the multi-body dynamics analysis work using the\nADAMS software. This work is specifically targeting understanding and mechanizing the physics associated with the\nground/shoe/track/roller interactions10. The current state of this analysis includes a single truck with two tracks of 11\nrollers each has been modelled. This model can treat the truck as a flexible body or as a rigid body. The ability to\noutput accelerations as sensor locations is implemented. Also concentrated mass to cover the effects of the CT chassis\nand any launch platform/launch vehicle payload can be added. Work is underway to add a fully looped track,\narticulating tracks, and ground deflection effects to the model. The system can be driven with realistic measurementbased speed. In addition to outputs corresponding to the measured outputs, roller axle displacements, and changing\nforces responding to variable roller/shoe interactions can be output as well. The displacement and force outputs can\nbe subjected to harmonic basis function analysis to allow expansion in time and operations.\n\n16\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\n11/21/16\n\nFigure 17. Measured Acceleration And A Harmonic Fit to 60Hz\nFigure 20 shows a recent multi-body dynamics model of a single CT truck. Note that this image of the model uses a\nflat track. The physical scars that an actual truck possess for the guide tube and JEL cynlinders (large circular\ndepression on top surrounded by four smaller circular depressions) as well as the gear system and track sprockets (cutouts at either end) are seen on the model. The 11 rollers are also seen on the outboard track. Advanced versions of\nthis model are in development that add the track sprockets at either end and change the track to a continuous loop over\nthe truck as seen in the real hardware. Refer to Figures 3, 4, and 5 for additional context with the actual structure.\nFigure 21 shows a 90 second run of the Adams model (top plot LHS) and a three second zoom (middle plot LHS).\nThe bottom plot also contains the same data but in the frequency domain. All the plots also show the analytical fit\nusing 21 harmonics up to six Hz. Once this fit is made, then the entire data set can be approximately extended to the\n1200 second extent of the corresponding measured data as shown in the three RHS figures. Note that there appears\nto be more complicated dynamics in the original time record due to the peaks not covered by the assumed harmonics\nor the chosen frequency cut-off. Longer time histories, different model damping, hardware observations, and refined\nsignal processing are being used to study these effects. The 1200 second expanded frequency data from the bottom\nplot of the RHS shows that the shoe spacing frequencies were captured well but the roller spacing harmonics are still\nsuppressed.\n17\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\n11/21/16\n\nFigure 18. First Order Estimate of Vertical Force Generated by One Truck during .7 MPH Speed\nFigure 22 shows a set of results from driving an FEM of the CT with a harmonically expanded set of Adams data.\nThis data shows that there was some reasonable coverage in the fore-aft (X) direction and the side-to-side (Z) direction.\nHowever, the up-down (Y) direction was over predicted. Part of the issue is that an estimate of phase and local speed\ndifferences between the four truck needs to be taken into account in a more realistic fashion. It cannot be assumed (as\nwas used in this data run) that all eight tracks were completely synchronized. Another issue is that Adams runs need\nlonger time estimates to reduce boundary and signal processing issues. Finally the harmonic fits are likely affected\nby using speed variations containing noise. Hence, filtering of the speed data before driving the harmonic analysis is\nin order. Also subsequent work has suggested that the flexible body effects of the truck would enhance the Adams\npredictions. Unfortunantly, flexible body models significantly increase the Adams run times.\n\n18\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\n11/21/16\n\nFigure 19.

Multi-Body Dynamics Results From a Single Truck and Expanded Using Harmonic Fit\n\nFigure 22. FEM Results From a Model Driven With Harmonically-Expanded Adams Data\n\nProblem #1 \xe2\x80\x93 Forcing Function for FEM Analysis\nAs mentioned earlier, the first problem concerns the production of a forcing function to drive FEM models enabling\nCoupled Loads Analyses (CLAs). These CLAs predict combined effects on the launch vehicle and launch platform\nduring rollout loading. Past analyses have used enforced acceleration loads at the interface between the CT and the\nlaunch platform. The CT is not even modelled in this approach and any CT dynamics are part of the forcing function\n(and potentially dynamic effects of the payload). Obviously, this approach would be quite simple to implement if\nmeasured acceleration data were available from a very similar system under roll at the same speeds as the CLA plans\n20\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\n11/21/16\ncall out. However, since the system to be modelled (SLS with SLS-ML on SLS-era CT) has not been assembled and\nwill not be assembled or tested until seaveral months after the CLA results are needed, the trivial solution is not viable.\nHence, the analytical tools and measured data mentioned in the previous section need to be used to develop a plan for\ncontructing such a forcing function to assess and if needed replace the current forcing function. This plan needs to\ninclude three parts: (A) forcing function development plan, (B) forcing function verification plan, and (C) forcing\nfunction backup plan. Each of these three aspects will be discussed based on the current state-of-knowledge.\nForcing Function Development Plan\nThe targeted forcing function will be acceleration inputs to the launch platform at the interface to the CT. Since the\nvehicle and the launch platform will not have been tested by the delivery of the forcing function, two forcing functions\nwill be produced: the final set which is the deliverable but a product of non-validated models and an intermediate set\nthat is derivable from available data. The final forcing functions will necessarily be derived from an analytical model\nof the SLS and the SLS-ML and verified with a combination of the most similar data available coupled with analytical\nresults using a separate and different modelling approach. Since the driven system model (SLS + SLS-ML) can be\nassumed to exist, the issue will be to provide the plan for developing the intermediate interface acceleration estimates.\nThese estimates will come from an analytical FEM system that includes the SLS, the SLS-ML, and the CT and driven\nby inputs that are as unaffected by system dynamics as possible (i.e. as close to the ground/shoe/roller interfaces as\npossible). Given the current data, these intermediate forcing functions will likely be forces acting below the JEL\nsystem on each of the four trucks of the CT as this is the location of the data closest to the desired interfaces. Enforced\naccelerations in lieu of forces are a possible modification to this plan (if needed) that will not negate the plan. The\nintermediate forces will be derived from measured/estimated accelerations from the trucks and augmented with forces\nfrom JEL system pressures. Low-pass filtered/smoothed speed measurements will also be used. These measured\naccelerations will be derived from all of the data acquired to-date on Shuttle-era hardware. A most critical database\nwill be the rollout data from the CxP ML on the Shuttle-era CT. The CxP ML data is critical because it is a transitional\ndataset between the Shuttle MLP and the SLS ML. The current plan is for the estimated forces to be time-shifted to\nproduce data at each desired rollout speed as was performed in reference5.\nThe conversion of below-JEL accelerations to the intermediate forces in the previous section is the critical aspect of\nthis planned process. This conversion will begin by estimating the mass needed to scale the accelerations of measured\nbelow the JEL system by mass values that are derived to match the axial forces estimated from JEL system pressures.\nTransverse and fore-aft directions will use the same scaling. Although it is possible that transverse and fore-aft scaling\nwill be affected by guide tube strains measured in the SLS-CT and SLS-ML rollout tests. Using these scaled versions\nof the below-JEL accelerations as inputs and the accelerations measured elsewhere as outputs, average FRF and\ninverse FRF transfer functions will be calculated. These will be used to estimate input forces acting at the below-JEL\naccelerometer measurements using a frequency domain inverse calculation15. These estimated forces will be filtered\nusing the harmonic basis functions appropriate for each measured speed. During the development phase, FEM models\nof the Shuttle-era data sets will be used to verify the forcing functions/transfer functions/mass scaling aspects of this\nplan. This verification will be performed by matching enforced FEM analysis to measured data from the rollout\ndatabases mentioned previously. It is possible that the SWAT approach or the Inverse Structural Filter approach can\nreplace the frequency domain inversion approach if verification suggests such an action1,3,5,15. It should be noted that\na critical input to thie process will be a model of the SLS-era CT, which is still in production. This model will be\nvalidated via the same FRF transfer function calculation mentioned above. Using FRF\xe2\x80\x99s derived from the CT only\ntests, the modal content of the CT will be measured and matched via model correlation.\nForcing Function Verification Plan\nThe final forcing functions will be verified first by assessing the intermediate forces via an Adams model of a simgle\ntruck propelled by measured speed variations properly loaded with payload mass. Harmonic analyses will be used to\nexpand the Adams data to longer times and estimate the effects of other trucks. Direct comparison to measured\naccelerations and analytical estimates of whole truck forces from the Adams analyses will be used to compare to the\nintermediate forcing functions listed above. It should be noted that validation will occur post-delivery when a\nvalidated SLS-ML model and data from the SLS are available. Second, the final forcing functions will also be\ncompared to measured accelerations from the previously mentioned existing data sets. In additional to a direct\ncomparison of the acceleration values, output accelerations from driving the SLS model with measured acceleration\ntime histories will contribute to verification. It should be noted, that it is possible that other measured accelerations\nmay prove conservative with respect to the final forcing functions as system dynamics may be artificially increasing\nresponse.\n21\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\n11/21/16\nForcing Function Backup Plan\nA backup to the development and verification plans mentioned above is required as there are technical and schedule\nuncertainties that might call for an alternative. The backup for the final forcing functions will be to directly use\nmeasured CT/launch platform accelerations. Again special emphasis will be given to the CxP-ML data. It should be\nnoted that the final forcing functions will enveloped from multiple measured sources in this case, they will contain\nconservatism in the resulting loads that may not be desired late in the design.\n\nProblem #2 \xe2\x80\x93 Forcing Function for Test Analysis\nThe second problem to be solved involves estimating the forcing function directly from the DRT test of the SLS\nvehicle on the SLS ML. This needs to be performed in a short period of time and to allow the generation of data that\ncan be used to directly assess and correlate the model of the launch vehicle. The development plan, validation plan,\nand backup plan will again be provided.\nForcing Function Development Plan\nThe previous section covered the estimation of FRFs from estimated inputs (based on measurements) to measured\noutputs. This approach is very similar to traditional approaches to perform model validation based on traiditional\nmodal testing. Also, due to the ability to average long records of data and potentially operate completely on\nmeansured data are advantages to this approach. Hence, measured data from the below-JEL truck acceleration, forces\nestimated form the JEL system pressures, and forces estimated from guide tube strains are expected to cover a full\nrange of inputs to the system and will be used as inputs to the FRF, inverse FRF, and force estimation processes. As\nbefore, the current plan is to use a frequency domain inversion process to place the force inputs where needed. It is\nexpected that any need to transition to other force estimation processes (or input accelerations) will be determined and\nimplemented using the rollout testing of the SLS-ML and will not be an issue when processing DRT data. The\nresulting FRF\xe2\x80\x99s and inverse FRF\xe2\x80\x99s will again be processed using traditional approaches The FRFs will be used to\nextract modal properites of the coupled sytem. The most uncertain aspect of this approach is still the selection of\nweighting for the below truck accelerations. However, the process to derive intermediate forcing function scaling\nfrom Problem #1 above will be available for use and will be enhanced by having validated CT and ML models.\nForcing Function Verification Plan\nThe complete process for deriving forces and FRFs will be exercised and validated during the SLS-ML roll to the pad.\nIn fact, the resulting FRFs will also be available for use in correlating the ML model. The validation of the actual\nforces used to develop FRFs will be validated via Adams runs of a single truck using measured speed inputs with\nmeasured forces from JEL system and guide tubes.\nForcing Function Backup Plan\nThe backup to develop the test-based forcing functions will be to drive the DRT data using operational operational\nmodal analysis tools16,17. This approach has been exercised on Shuttle6 and Ares1-X rollout data with varying degrees\nof success. As with the primary approach, this backup approach will be completely based on measured data. However,\nthere are limitations to the parameter space that can be extracted using OMA processing. Specifically, closely spaced\nmodes and modal parcipation scaling would not be readily extracted.\n\nConclusions\nThe SLS rollout environment to the launch pad will be rich with forced harmonics and higher order effects. This\nsituation can create design and fatigue loads, especially when the forcing functions interact with the system dynamics.\nHowever, the same environment can be a useful operational scenario for extracting structural dynamics information.\nThe previous, ongoing, and future work in this area create a need to integrate a broad range of data and understanding.\nThis paper represents the first phase of this integration by providing an overview of the hardware, the definitions, the\nexisting and planned data, and previous and ongoing analyses. This information provided is necessary to allow the\nneeded assimilation and integration. This paper has also initialized the integration by providing the primary,\nvalidation, and backup plans for solving two problems: (1) developing a set of rollout forcing functions (as enforced\ndisplacements) for enabling Finite Element Model (FEM) Coupled Loads Analyses (CLAs); and (2) deriving forcing\nfunctions (as input forces) and Frequency Response Function (FRFs) with respect to the measured outputs during the\nrollout of the Space Launch System (SLS) and the Mobile Launcher (ML).\n\n22\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\n11/21/16\nA critical aspect of the current plans for addressing both problems will be to use a frequency domain inversion process\nto estimate forces. The required transfer functions are planned to be developed using measured accelerations closest\nto the interaction between the ground, the tracks, and the trucks of the Crawler Transporter (CT). These accelerations\nwill be mass scaled using information measured pressures in the hydraulic systems supporting the payload. A\nharmonic curve fit will be performed to filter the forcing functions based on the known geometries of the hardware\nand the measured speeds. The plans include utilizing measurement-only estimations of force and transfer functions\nbut verified with advanced multi-body dynamics and/or data form similar systems. Backup plans using alternative\nforce estimation techniques, hybrid analytical/test methods, and operational modal analysis techniques are provided.\nThe integration and plans provided herein are currently beign subjected to the assessments provided by the databases\nin place from NASA\xe2\x80\x99s previous Shuttle and Constellation Programs. The culmination of the integration,\nimplementation, and validation of this work will be the subject of subsequent publications and reports.\n\nReferences\n1G. James, T. Carne, and B.
