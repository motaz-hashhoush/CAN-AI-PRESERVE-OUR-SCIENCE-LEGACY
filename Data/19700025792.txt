ACCOPLISHMENTS\nA.\n\nGeodesy\n\nIt had been proposed to examine the use of a synchronous\n\ncontrolled satellite and precise laser range measurements for\n\nthe determination of polar wandering, continental drift, and\n\nvariations in the earth\'s rotation rate.\n\nDevelopment of the\n\n\n-2\xc2\xad\nbasic functional relationships between range and geodetic para\xc2\xad\nmeters has been completed and was based on one controllable\n\nsynchronous satellite (the Benchmark Satellite) and one freely\n\ndrifting synchronous satellite.\n\nThe controllable satellite would\n\n\nbe forced to remain earth-fixed by active thrusting and laser\n\nranging to ground stations and therefore could serve as a known\n\nposition or benchmark in space.\n\nThe analysis developed in terms\n\n\nof ranging between a benchmark satellite and a freely drifting\n\nsatellite was general and may be applied directly to ground based\n\nobservations.\n\nAnalysis of ground based observations has been\n\n\ninitiated but no results can be reported at this time.\n\nThe\n\n\nanalytical development is presented in the paper on polar wandering.\n\nAn independent means for determining continental drift was\n\nalso investigated.\n\nThis technique involves the use of laser range\n\n\ndata to subsynchronous satellites and it is demonstrated.that the\n\naccuracy is- essentially independent of satellite height beyond one\n\nearth radius and of ground station locations.\n\nThis research is\n\n\ndescribed in.the paper on continental drift.\n\nB.\n\nResearch Accomplishments in Attitude-Control of Spinning Spacecraft\n\nThe accomplishments of this program include the following\n\ndevelopments:\n\n(a) A completely active control logic has been developed for\n\ncontrolling the attitude of a spin-stabilized axisymmetric\n\nspacecraft having arbitrary (but non-spherical) inertial\n\n\n-3\xc2\xad\n\ncharacteristics.\n\nThe developed control logic is formulated\n\n\nfrom a direction-cosine kinematic model, and is accordingly\n\nnot restricted by either small angle assumptions or by\n\nkinematic singularities.\n\nThe formulated \'ontrol logic can\n\n\nbe reilized by means of one body-fixed reaction jet, and\n\nmakes use of existing sensor systems.\n\nDetails of this de\xc2\xad\n\nvelopment are included in the two enclosed papers:\n\n(i)\n\n\nOptimal Direction-Cosine Attitude-Control Logic for SpinStabilized Axisymmtric Spacecraft (submitted to AIAA Journal\nof Spacecraft and Rockets 15 May 1970),\n\nand (ii)\n\nDirection-\n\nCosine Attitude-Control Logic for Spin-Stabilized Axisynetric\nSpacecraft (accepted for publication in AIAA Journal of Space\xc2\xad\ncraft and Rockets 14 April 1970).\nA\n(b) \t considerable quantity of work has been expended towards the\ndevelopment of an active control system for a moderately\nasymmetric spinning body.\n\nThe enclosed report outlines an\n\nimproved analytical solution for the torque-free motion of a\nspinning asymmetric body.\n\nThis solution should be of con\xc2\xad\n\nsiderable value in the development of impulsive control logic,\nsince it is valid for large angles, and allows a time-varying\n\nspinspeed.\n\nDetails of this analysis are included in the\n\n\nenclosed paper.\nSpace-Based Orbit Determination\n\nC. \t\nTechniques involving range only data for orbit

POLAR WANDERING\n\nIntroduction\n\nIt is well known that the Earth\'s rotation axis undergoes a pre\xc2\xad\ncession and nutation due to gravitational torques exerted by the sun and\n\nmoon.\n\nIn addition to this motion, the Earth has been observed to shift\n\n\nor wobble with respect to its axis of rotation.\n\nEvidence for such a\n\n\nmotion consists primarily of astronomical observations conducted by the\n\nInternational Latitude Service (ILS) since the turn of the century.\n\nSince 1962, the International Polar Motion Service (IPMS) has carried on\n\nthe work of the ILS, and an independent determination of polar motion\n\nhas been made by the Bureau Internation de l\'Heure (BIH) in Paris since\n\n1955.\n\nThe amplitude of the wobble (Termed the Chandler,Wobble) is on the\n\norder of 0".1 to 0".2, and the period is approximately 14 months.\n\nThe\n\n\nmost precise observatory instruments presently in use for latitude and\n\nsidereal time determinations are the photographic zenith tubej(PZT) and\n\nthe Danjon impersonal prismatic astrolab7e.\n\nThese instruments have a\n\n\nstandard deviation of 0\'".075 from 14 - 15 star observations during one\n\nnight or 0".2 from a single determination [Mueller, 1969].\n\nMonthly\n\n\naveraging of such astronomical observations theoretically results in a\n\nprobable error on the order of 071.01 [Markowitz, 1968].\n\nHowever,\n\n\nsystematic differences of up to 0".1 are present when the ILS-IPMS data\n\nare compared with results obtained by the BIH [Smylie and Manshina, 1968).\n\nIn addition to6 the Chandler Wobble, it is suspected that a secular shift\n\nin the mean pole position occurs at a rate of about 071.002 - 0\'.003\n\nalong a meridian 600 - 700 West.\n\n[Markowitz, 1968; Yumi and Wako, 1968).\n\n\n-3-.\n\nIt\n\nhas been suggested that the motion of the pole is\n\nsustained by\n\nseasonal variations in the Earth\'s mass distribution [Munk and Macdonald,\n\n1960] and by earthquakes [Smylie and Manshina, 1968], but the observa\xc2\xad\ntional data presently available are of insufficient accuracy to allow\n\nproper investigation of such phenomena.\n\nIt would be desirable to obtain\n\n\nmore accurate data from -an independent experiment.\n\nA method of measuring the motion of the Earth with respect to its\n\naxis of rotation by means of two synchronous satellites is currently\n\nbeing investigated;\n\nThe technique involves laser ranging between a con\xc2\xad\n\ntrolled or proof satellite and a freely drifting satellite.\n\nThe proof\n\n\nsatellite is forced to maintain its position relative to the Earth by\n\nmeans of active thrusting and laser ranging to three ground stations.\n\nThe free satellite is\ntion.\n\nunaffected by small changes in \'the Earth\'s orienta\xc2\xad\n\nTherefore, intersatellite range measurements provide an indication\n\n\nof the motion of the Earth.\n\nPerturbations of the satellite orbits and\n\nthe movement of the Earth\'s rotation axis in space are accounted for so\n\nas to permit calculation of the amplitude of any shift of the pole with\n\nrespect to the rotation axis to within 0\'\'.0001.\n\n-4-\n\nPolar Motion Coordinates\n\nThe pole of epoch is defined as the point of intersection of the\nEarth\'s axis of rotation with its surface at a particular time, called\nepoch.\n\nThe polar axis of epoch is defined to be a geocentric axis pass\xc2\xad\n\ning through a fixed point on the Earth\'s surface corresponding to the\npole of epoch.\n\nThe term "polar motion" refers to a change in the posi\xc2\xad\n\ntion of the polar axis of epoch relative to the axis of rotation.\n\nGreat\n\ncircles normal to the polar axis of epoch-and to the axis of rotation\nare called the earth-fixed equator and the rotation equator respectively.\nThe position of the earth-fixed equator relative to the rotation equator\nis specified by the angle a between the two equatorial planes and the\neast longitude F of the ascending node of the earth-fixed equator with\nrespect to a reference point P-1 on the rotation equator.\n\nThe polar\n\nmotion.coordinates a and F are shown in Figure 1.\n\naxis of rotation\n\n\npolar axis\nof epoch\n"--\n\n,\n\n.\n\nEarth-fixed\n- equator\n\nr\n\nXpP\n\nF. 1\n\nFig. i.\n\nPolar Motion Coordinates.\n\n\n-5-\n\nRelationship to Traditional Polar Motion Coordinates\n\nTraditionally, the position of the axis of rotation relative to the\n\npolar axis of epoch is specified by the rectangular coordinates (x, x.)\n\nas shown in Figure 2. The polar axis chosen as a reference is known as\n\nthe Conventional International Origin (CIO), and corresponds to a mean pole\n\nof 1900-1905,\n\nIt will prove advantageous in the following kinematical de\xc2\xad\n\nvelopment to define a new pole of epoch to be the position of the spin\n\naxis at the time of initiation of a particular experiment.\n\nThe change to\n\n\na new pole of epoch involves a simple translation of the coordinate axes\n\nshown in Figure 2. As a consequence of the small magnitude of x, and x?\n\n(a few tenths of an arc second) it makes very little difference whether\n\nthey are taken to be angles, as suggested by Figure 2, or direction\n\ncosines of the Earth\'s spin axis.\n\nThe direction cosine interpretation\n\n\nis used in the following development of equations which relate x, and\n\nx2 to the nodal coordinates a and r.\n\n\nLet x1 , x 2 , and x3 be direction cosines of the spin axis with respect to\n\nan Earth-fixed coordinate system having its x, y, and z.axes through the\n\nGreenwich meridian, 900 east longitude, and the pole of epoch respectively.\n\nx2\n\n90\' East\n\n\n0.1"-\n\n\nGreenwich.\n\n-I\n\n?ole of\nepoch\n\n\nI\n\nx1\n\n\nFig. 2.

800\n\n\nN1 =\nR\n\n=\n\n340\n\n\n6380 1M\n\nand Case 2 involves the benchmark satellite with coordinates\nE2 =\nN\n\n=\n\n-\n\n1150\n00\n\n\n2\n\nR 2=\n\n42,100\n\nM0\n\nThe satellite and station coordinates selected for Case 1 correspond\nroughly to a pass of Geos -A over RosmanN.C.\n-115o\n\nThe east longitude of\n\nfor the benchmark satellite -corresponds to a stable equilibrium\n\npoint over the Pacific.\nin the calculations.\n\nA spin axis inclination of 10- 4 radians is used\n\n\nRange is normalized to rn/R , where R. = 6371 KM.\n\n\n-24-\n\n\nThe satellite being tracked from the ground station of Case 1 is observed\n\nat an elevation angle of 400 above the horizon.\n\nAll of the sensitivity\'\n\n\napproach zero as the elevation angle approaches\n\nexpressions except 9r /R\nn\nn\n900, and below 400 atmospheric effects on the quality of range data become\n\nsevere.\n\nTherefore, values listed for the sensitivities correspond-to the\n\n\nlargest that can be obtained in practice.\n\nThe results of the example\n\n\ncomputations are presented as Figures 11 through 26 following the dis\xc2\xad\ncussion.\n\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe maximum sensitivity of range to polar motion is an order of magnitude\n\ngreater for the benchmark satellite (Fig. 25 and 26) than for the ground\n\nbased observations (Fig. 23 and 24).\n\nThis is due to the "lever arm" effect\n\n\nresulting from an increased geocentric radius Rn\n and from the fact that an\n\nelevation angle of 00 is permissible for the benchmark satellite.\n\nThe same\n\n\nremarks hold true regarding sensitivity to precession and nutation of the\n\nEarth\'s spin axis.\n\nIn a sense, the benchmark satellite concept represents the ideal situ\xc2\xad\nation for a tracking station.\n\nObservations would be-made in a vacuum and\n\n\na much larger portion of the trajectory of a particular satellite would be\n\nvisible.\n\nWith regard to the pblar motion determination, it is expected\n\n\nthat intersatellite range measurements, together with-the ground-to-satellite.\n\nrange information, will permit the determination of satellite positions to\n\nwithin abjout one centimeter.\n\nOne centimeter at synchronous altitude corres\xc2\xad\n\n- 5\n\narc seconds or within 0\'\'.0001.\n\nponds to an angular uncertainty of 4.75xi0\n\n-25-\n\n\nThe potential of ground based observations for precise determinatoi\nof geodetic parameters is also clearly indicated by the results which\nhave been obtained.\n\nFor example, 3(rLRE)/x\n\n2\n\nreaches approximately\n\n0.8 for an aximuth of 80\' (Fig. 24), so that a shift in the pole in the\n\nx2 \ndirection by, say 5 meters, produces a corresponding change of 4 meters\n\nin range.,\n\n\nLIST OF ILLUSTRATIONS FOR EXAMPLE COMPUTATIONS\n\n\nFigure 11 \n\n12 \n\n13\n\n14\n\n\nGround Station, Satellite Being Observed\n\nDue East\n\n\nFigure 15 \n\n16 \n\n17\n\n18\n\n\nGround Station, Satellite Being Observed\n\nDue North\n\n\nFigure 19 \n\n20 \n\n21\n\n22\n\n\nBenchmark Satellite, Satellite Being\n\nObserved Due North\n\n\nFigure 23 \n\n24\n\n\nPolar Motion Sensitivity for Ground Station\n\n\nFigure 25 \n\n26 \n\n\nPolar Motion Sensitivity for Benchmark\n\nSatellite\n\n\nvTY OF\n\n_________________________SENSTTI\n\nE\n\nom.\n\nU.\n\nU__\n\n(RI/RE)\n\nO (r8N/RE)\nCOORDINATES\n\nOF\n\nQST\n\n\xc2\xb1ooooE~l\n\n=\n\n/\n\n1Y=\n\n/0\n\nXA\n\nD (KN/RE.)\nU (Hl~i/RE)\n\nD\n\nSAT&LL1Wc RLLATI\n---\n\nO\n\nve22b230E~nO\n\nb FIRN\n\n=-.o424i131E40\n=-.O~bMicS2L+OO\n\n\n_\n\nEARTn ROTATION PAMTE COcmrCTI,(r\n\n0 (H/kED\n\nGAP\n\nM,_\'\n\nA\n\nrOj 06SERVER\n\n___\n\n____\n\n___~-________\n\ntuAp R /RE)\n\nCC P,\n\n(KILOMETERS)\n\n-\n\nB\n-A"Lt W E-FFSP IN_- X IS7ANDPOEOPE POCR--\n\n,/452j2,9tE-n1)\n\nOBSERVER\n\nTO GE7ODE\n\nAOIO\nTOAU REWC(DETINOSN\n\nPOLTN\n\nxi00UDE0\n\nRANG\n\nU&.uCOO~d\nF0SERVr-R (DEGREES)\n\nE~fLN~fD\n\n3\n\n~\n\n.)ATE LL4TT\n\n~~t3b?3SIt7\'C\'L0U-----\xc2\xad\n\n_\n\n\n__\n\n_\n\nAIVO\n\n-PRECESSION\n\nNUTALLf01\'\n\nOr- VHL\n\n~_________________\n\nEARkTH\n\no\to\n\nba004L-~ \t\n\n.361S3766E+0O\n\n\nd9L-0\n11 2________429A94 \t\n\no U\n\n_______\n\n*33894043v-.00\n\n--\n\n~\n\n?-0.06\n.021\n00\n40.00 \t\n___________,303]a\nU) .00\n\n_.!_\n\n*1t97h1b6VE-O1\n0\n2 1A.% 69K:-.4\n,66-AA247ri-04\n2kV3 E-0A\n*3i60919b7E-04\n\n80.00\n\n___0,\n\n(RN/RE)/D (NUTATIONL\n0LNR-(ER\n\nSIN \t\n\nS.LJA&GRSS)\n-_____\n\n_\n\n.a5b537946E"\'04 \t\n\n#42751480E+00\n\n.30345 87F+00\n\n\n*337Q78 ?004\n.. i1 4k(3E-0cl4________\n.27SIP523L-04\n.23b s;4 0 0Lt4r~____\n*1656pqt9E-04 \t\n\n..2\'4,6,14$f53E.ft0______\n\n* 18136509E+00\n*111070 97E +00\xc2\xad\n_ -.37402013E-C01\n,3740.3 38552--00\n-141072,30E+00\n\n160,00o\n\n.707#-n1426-05 \t\n\n-,24614966E.0Q\n\ni60,0\n______\n\n.D6o7bo0\n\n-. 3S153775E.00\n\n_1.90\n\n,0.\n\n-\n\n?.9nl\n\n-. 3 \' 894.035E.00\n\n1 E!!

This financial support is gratefully acknowledged.\n\n\n-2-\n\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nA subject of great controversy for nearly three hundred years was\n\nthe flattening of the earth.\n\nIt was observed by French explorers in\n\n\n1672 that their pendulum clocks ran more slowly near the equator than\n\nin Paris and this led to a postulated flattening of the earth and many\n\nsubsequent studies to determine the degree of flattening.\n\nMany studies\n\n\nwere geometric in nature and involved astronomical measurement techniques,\n\nmany were dynamical and made use of observations of the moon, some in\xc2\xad\nvolved hydrostatics and hydrodynamics, and none were in agreement with\n\none another.\n\nIn 1948 Sir Harold Jeffries combined the results of many\n\n\nprevious studies and arrived at a value for the flattening that was\n\ngenerally accepted by geodesists.\n\nHowever, observations of satellites\n\n\nin 1958 resulted in a slightly different value for the flattening than\n\nwas previously accepted.\n\nThis was of significant importance to geo\xc2\xad\n\nphysicists and led to the abandonment of some theories of the earth\'s\n\ninterior [l].\n\nThe purpose of this discussion is to emphasize the role that arti\xc2\xad\nficial satellites have played in resolving a highly controversial problem\n\nin geodesy.\n\nWe are currently faced with several analogous situations.\n\n\nThese involve the concepts of continental drift, polar wandering, and\n\nvariations in the angular speed of the earth.\n\nThese concepts have been\n\n\ndebated vigorously for many years, many experiments have been performed\n\nto measure the quantities in question, and yet there is still not general\n\nagreement as to their existence and very little agreement as to their\n\n\n-3\xc2\xad\ncause.\n\nThe situation is very similar to that of the degree of flattening\n\n\nand it would be of significant value if an independent experiment could\n\nbe devised that would lead to more accurate measurements.\n\nThe purpose\n\n\nof this paper is to present some results of an investigation of possible\n\nexperiments involving a synchronous satellite (or satellites) that will\n\nresult in precise determinations of continental drift, variations in\n\nangular speed, and the polar wandering.\n\n\nCONTINENTAL DRIFT\n\nThe possibility that the continents of the earth have been drifting\n\nrelative to one another throughout the earth\'s history has been discussed\n\nfor three hundred years and debated vigorously for the past fifty years\n\n[2].\n\nThe hypothesis of continental drift has been strongly supported in\n\n\nmany recent books and papers ([3],\npresented for the drift rates\n\n([3],\n\n[4],\n\n[5]) and many estimates have been\n\n\n[4]).\n\nHowever, its validity is re\xc2\xad\n\ngarded with scepticism by many scholars [2] and even denied by some [6].\n\nIf the drift rates were accurately determined, substantial questions re\xc2\xad\ngarding the structure of the earth\'s upper mantle could be answered and\n\nthe cause of drift might be determined.\n\nThis could lead to a better under\xc2\xad\n\nstanding of the origin of the earth and may be of value in determining man\'s\n\nfuture on the earth.\n\nIt is pointed out by Wilson [2] that the arguments about continental\n\ndrift resolve themselves into three questions.\n\nThe first question is\n\n\nwhether drift has occurred and whether it is still occurring.\n\nIf the\n\n\noccurrence of drift can be verified, the second question is to determine\n\nthe pattern of drift of all the continents that gives a best fit to the\n\nobservations.\n\nFinally, the third question to be answered is to determine\n\n\n-4\xc2\xad\n\nthe nature of the forces that cause the drift.\nquestions are currently unresolved.\n\nAll three of these\n\n\nThe original hypothesis of conti\xc2\xad\n\nnental drift was based on the obvious similarities that exist between\n\nthe coastlines of various land masses.\n\nThis concept has been further\n\n\nexplored recently by using a digital computer to assemble the continents\n\nin a "best fit" manner [].\n\nHowever, the primary results in support of\n\n\ncontinental drift have been obtained by analysis of palaeomagnetic data.\n\nBy measuring magnetic anomaly patterns along faults various investigators\n\nhave determined drift rates between continents.\n\nMorgan [3] divides the\n\n\nearth into twenty blocks, each one bounded by rises, trenches, or faults,\n\nand determines the relative motions of the blocks.\n\nIt is found, for example,\n\n\nthat the Antarctic block has a maximum spreading rate relative to the Pacific\n\nblock of 5.7 \xc2\xb1 0.2 cm/year.\n\nIt should be pointed out however, that the\n\n\nuse of rock magnetic data in investigations of continental drift depends\n\non postulating a model geomagnetic field because it is not known how the\n\nactual geomagnetic field behaved over long intervals of geological time.\n\nThe validity of conclusions drawn from magnetic data depends on the accuracy\n\nof the model geomagnetic field [9].\n\nHowever, the evidence obtained in this\n\n\nmanner lends strong support to the hypothesis of drift.\n\nAnother technique that has proved to be of some consequence is to\n\nemploy astronomical evidence.\n\nThe most satisfactory results have been\n\n\nobtained by the International Latitude Service (ILS) by using a chain of\n\nfive zenith telescopes around the earth at latitude 390081 N\n\n[1].\n\nData\n\n\nhave been taken almost continuously since the end of the last century and\n\n\n-5\xc2\xad\n\nthese data have been extensively analyzed [ii].\n\nThe results indicate\n\n\nthat the observing stations have been fixed in latitude with respect to\n\nthe earth within 0.01 seconds of arc over a half century and so secular\n\nmotions in the north-south direction appear to be less than one centi\xc2\xad\nmeter per year at the present time [10].\n\nHowever, this technique does\xc2\xad\n\nnot provide adequate information with respect to variations in longitude\n\nand does not exclude the possibility of east-west motions of up to one\xc2\xad\nhalf meter per year.\n\nThe prospects for improvement in determining continental drift are\n\nvaried.\n\nThe astronomical techniques may be extended to provide coverage\n\n\non a more pearly world-wide basis but not without considerable expenditures.\n\nThe magnetic anomaly approach may be extended by obtaining and analyzing\n\nadditional data.\n\nHowever, this is complicated by the fact that measure\xc2\xad\n\nments over most of Asia are currently denied.\n\nSatellites offer the op\xc2\xad\n\nportunity of observing large portions .of the earth\'s surface simultaneously\n\nand may provide the means of performing independent, and very precise,\n\nexperiments to ascertain the current existence of continental drift.\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF METHOD\n\nIt has been estimated\n\nthat a Q-switched laser with an output pulse\n\n\nof 10 ns\'can be used to determine the range to a satellite to a precision\n\nof 15 cm or less [12].\n\nBy making simultaneous range observations to a\n\n\nsatellite from four ground stations and by repeating this for thirty\n\nsatellite positions the interstation distances may be determined to within\n\nan average error of 50 cm.\n\nTherefore it should be possible to obtain a\n\n\n-6\xc2\xad\ndirect measurement of continental drift rates after only two or three\n\nyears of observations.\n\nThe approach is briefly described below.\n\n\nSuppose that R3 represents the vector from the origin of some\n\njth\n\narbitrary coordinate system to the satellite at the time of the\nth\n\n*1i\n\nrange measurement.\nand r\n\nl\n\nLet\n\n9\n\nrepresent the vector to the i\n\nrepresent the range vector (see Figure 1).\n\nstation\n\nThe vectors are\n\nrelated by the following expression:\n\n\n,\n\ni\n\nj\n\n4\n\n,\n\nc-\n\n,3\n\n\n1 ,-",30\n\n\nFor a given j this provides four equations for five unknowns.\n\nIn\n\n\nterms of components there are 120 equations for 126 unknowns (36 sta\xc2\xad\ntion coordinates and 90 satellite coordinates).\n\nThe system can be\n\n\nmade determinate by specifying six of the unknowns.\ndone arbitrarily but it can be done as follows.\n\nThis cannot be\n\n\nSpecify the coordi\xc2\xad\n\nnates of one station (arbitrarily), then two components of the direction\n\nof motion of a second station relative to the first, and finally one\n\ncomponent of the relative motion of a third station.\n\nThe following\n\n\nrelative displacements were selected for this analysis:\n\n\n6c\n\n2\n\n=\n\n6C 2 = 6CcZ = 6c 1 1 = 6

No\n\nattempt has been made to locate the stations at points of maximum relative\n\nmovement; rather, they have been selected to be distributed somewhat\n\nuniformly over the Earth\'s surface. \n It was found, however, that if the\n\nstation at Houston is replaced in favor of one at Goddard Space Flight\n\nCenter, then the standard deviations in the determination of the inter\xc2\xad\nstation distances increased significantly.\n\nAlso, it is not required that\n\n\n12 stations be used; in fact, if L represents the number of stations used\n\nat each observation time, M represents the number of observation times,\n\nand N represents the number of stations, then all that is required is that\n\nLM = 3(N + M) - 6, where L : N.\n\nFor example, the ten stations to be em\xc2\xad\n\nployed in the current Isogex experiment could be used in the analysis.\n\nThis is currently being examined.\n\nORBIT SELECTION\n\nThe technique requires that the satellite pass approximately over\n\nthe midpoint of each great circle arc connecting all of the ground\n\nstations.\n\nIt was considered to be desirable to maximize the number of\n\n\ntimes that the satellite passes near the required points in order to\n\nincrease the opportunities for making the range measurements.\n\nThe problem is to determine the orbit parameters that result in\n\nmaximizing the opportunities for observation.\n\nTwo analytical formula\xc2\xad\n\ntions of the problem are described below.\n\nLet Zk\n\n6k\n\nrepresent the longitude and latitude of the particular\n\n\npoints of interest.\n\nLet L(t), S(t) represent the longitude and latitude\n\n\n-9\xc2\xad\nof the satellite at any time (t) and let Lo, 6\nof longitude and latitude.\n\nbe the initial values\n\n\nThe problem may then be stated as a param\xc2\xad\n\neter optimization problem as follows.\n\nDetermine Lo, 6o, and the orbit\n\n\ninclination and period to minimize the cost function\n\nT\n\n\nJ\n\n=\n\nI k=l\n\nW(\n\nkk\n\n- L(t))2 + (6 -

Childs*\n\nColorado State University\n\nFort Collins, Colorado\n\n\nN70-35 111\n\nABSTRACT\n\nThe developments of this study yield a control logic for the active\n\nattitude control of a spin-stabilized axisymmetric spacecraft.\n\nThe derived\n\n\ncontrol logic makes use of direction cosines for attitude definition, and is\n\nnot restricted by either small angle assumptions or by the kinematic singu\xc2\xad\nlarities associated with Euler angles.\n\nThe active torqueing capability is\n\n\nprovided by means of a reaction-jet system, and the control logic is simpli\xc2\xad\nfied by assuming that control torques may be applied impulsively.\n\nThe control\n\n\nlogic formulated is optimal in the sense that each control impulse is delivered\n\nin such a manner as to cause a maximum reduction in "system error."\n\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe basic objective of the analysis which follows is the synthesis of\n\nan active feedback attitude-control logic\nspacecraft.\n\nfor spin-stabilized axisymmetric\n\nControl torques are to be generated by means of a reaction-jet\n\n\nsystem, and the proposed control logic is simplified by assuming that control\n\ntorques may be applied impulsively.\n\nPulse-width modulation is suggested for\n\n\ngenerating the derived control impulses.\n\n*Assistant Professor of Mechanical Engineering\n\n\n2\n\nWindeknecht [1]* was the first of several authors [2, 3] to suggest\n\nimpulsive control logic for passively damped spacecraft.\n\nSince passive damp\xc2\xad\n\ning systems are only effective if the spin-axis moment of inertia is.greater\n\nthan either transverse-axis moment of inertia [4], the control logic suggested\n\nin [1 - 3] is not workable for many spacecraft configurations.\n\nIn contrast\n\n\nto these systems, Porcelli and Connolly [5] have suggested a control logic\n\nfor the active control of slender (i.e., "pencil-shaped") spacecraft.\n\nChilds\n\n\n[6) has recently suggested a control logic which is applicable for axisymmetric\n\nspacecraft of arbitrary inertial proportions; i.e., it would be used to con\xc2\xad\ntrol a "disk-shaped" body, a "pencil-shaped" body, or any configuration lying\n\nbetween these extremes.\n\nAll of the above cited control approaches employ Euler angles as kine\xc2\xad\nmatic variables and are restricted in application to situations which do not\n\nrequire "large" angular reorientations.\n\nThe control logic suggested by\n\n\nPorcelli and Connolly and by Childs are based on linearized Euler angle models\n\nwhich become questionable for angular reorientations in excess of\nimately).\n\n15 \'\n\n(approx\xc2\xad\n\nWhile these control approaches could be extended by changes in ref\xc2\xad\n\nerence, a more fundamental approach consists of employing a kinematical repre\xc2\xad\nsentation which does not have the inherent kinematic singularity associated\n\nwith Euler angles.\n\nThe components of the direction cosine matrix [7, 8] are\n\n\nsuch a representation, and the analysis of this study makes use of them in a\n\ndevelopment similar to that of Childs [6].\n\n\nTHE CONTROL MODEL\n\nThe basic attitude-control requirement for spin-stabilized spacecraft\n\nis that the spin axis be placed and maintained within some small defined\n\n*Identifies listing in reference section\n\n\n3\n\nThe physical variables which must\n\n\nneighborhood of a prescribed orientation.\n\nThe angular rates\n\n\nbe controlled are angular rates and angular displacements.\n\nmay be defined by Euler\'s equations of motion for a rigid body which, for ay\n\naxisymmetric body, are stated as\n\n\nwi + aQo 2\n\n=\n\nMI\n\n=\n\nu(t) cos T(t)\n\n- aQui\n1\n\n=\n\nM2/I\n\n=\n\nu(t) sin i(t)\n\n=\n\n03()\n\nCi)\n\n3(t)\n\n(1)\n\n=\n\nwhere\n\na\n\n=\n\n(I\n\n(2)\n\n\n- 1)/1\n\nand the subscripts 1, 2, 3 identify body-fixed\naxis the axis of symmetry.\n\nThe origin of the\n\nwith the mass center of the rigid body.\nM2\n\nx1 , x2, x 3 axes with the\nx1, x 2 , x3\n\nThe variables\n\nx3\n\nsystem coincides\n\nW1,\n\nWZ\n\n,\n\nW3\n\nand\n\nMI,\n\nare, respectively, the components of the angular velocity vector of the body\n\nand the external torque vector.\n\nThe parameters\n\nI\n\nand\n\nare, respectively,\n\n13\n\nthe transverse (II = 12 = I) and spin-axis moment of inertias.\n\nThe form of\n\n\n(1) implies that control is to be supplied by a gimballed torqueing system,\n\nn(t)\n\ni.e., that\n\nis an unbounded control variable.\n\n\nThe angular orientation of the body-fixed\ninertial\n\nXi\n\nxi\n\nsystem relative to an\n\n\nsystem may be defined by the direction cosine matrix [A].\n\nthe components of the arbitrary vector\n\nV\n\nin the\n\nxi\n\nand\n\nXi\n\nIf\n\n\nsystems are\n\n\ndenoted, respectively, by (v), and (v)i, the direction cosine matrix satisfies\n\n\nCv) i\n\n=\n\n[A](v)1\n\n;\n\n(v)\n\n= \n\n\n[A]T(v) i\n\nwhere "T" denotes the matrix transpose operation.\nrelated ([7],\n\n(1)by\n\n\n(3)\n\n\nFurther, the matrix [A) is\n\n\n[8]) to the components of the angular velocity vector cited in\n\n\n4\n\n[(]\n\n=\n\n-\n\n[(o)J[A]\n\n(4)\n\nutdere\n\n\n(5)\nW3\n-(02\n\n0\n\n-W,\n\nW-1\n\n0\n\nSince only the spin-axis orientation orientation is significant, one\n\n\nextracts from (4)\n\n\na3\n\n=\n\na2 3\n\n= -Qa1 3 + Woa33\n\na 33\n\n=\n\nga2i -\n\nW2a3\n\n(6)\n\n\nw2 a1 3 - w 1a 2 3\n\n\nThese variables are not independent, since they satisfy the kinematic con\xc2\xad\nstraint\n\na\n\n3\n\n+ aZ 3 + a3a\n\n1\n\n(7)\n\n\nEquations (1) and (6) constitute the system of governing equations.\n\nThe\n\n\nkinematic definition given in (6) is not restricted by either small angle\n\napproximations or by kinematic singularities.\n\nThe control logic derived in this study is based on the assumption that\nthe effect of a "short-durati6n" firing of the gimballed reaction jet\n\nadequately approximated by an impulse.\n\nSince a reaction jet is essentially\n\nan "on-off" device, i.e.,\nu\n\n=\n\nU>0, or u = 0\n\nthe magnitude of a control impulse is approximately defined by\n\n\nJ\n\n= UIAt\n\n\ncan be\n\n5\n\nwhere\n\nAt\n\nis the firing duration.\n\nBy varying\n\nAt\n\none obtains impulses of\n\n\nvarying magnitude. \n This approach is commonly referred to as pulse-widt\'\n\nmodulation.\n\nTo determine the effect of a control impulse, Eq\'s (1) and \n(6) are\n\nrestated as\niaQw + UG(t)\n\n=\n\n(8)\n\n\nand\n\n\na \t ia 3 3cW\na3 3\n\nn\n\n-\n\no 2a1 3\n\n=\n\n(9)\n\n_- a23\n\nwhere\n\n+ iW 2\n\nW \t Wi\n=\n\n=\n\nIde 0\n\n;\n\na = a 13 + ia\n\n23\n\n=\n\nijle\' #\n\n(10)\n\n= u(t)eifl(t)\n\n0(t)\n\nThe solution to (8) for the control impulse\nu(t)\n\n(J1/l)S(t-t\') = (IJ1I/I)e i\n\n=\n\nI6(t-t)\n\n(11)\n\ncan be expressed as\n\nw(t)\n\n=\n\neiat \t\n\nt < t\n\n(12)\n\nwhere\n\nI\n\n=\nT \t t-t\n\nOo\n(O = W(O) = j \xc2\xb0Je\n\n*\n\n(13)\n\nl\n\n=\n\nw(tl\n\n)\n\n=\n\nOe ait + (J\'/i)\n\nFrom (12), Eq.

The variables\n\nW,\n\nWZ, W3\n\nand\n\nMI, M2 are, respectively, the components of the angular\n\n\nvelocity vector of the body and the external torque vector. The parameters\n\nI and\n\n13\n\nare, respectively, the transverse (11 = 12 = I) and spin-axis\n\nmoment of inertias.\n\nThe form of (1) implies that control is to be supplied\n\nby a gimballed torqueing system, i.e., that n(t)\n\nis an unbounded control\n\nvariable.\n\nThe angular orientation of the body-fixed\ninertial\n\nxi system relative to an\n\n\nX. system may be defined by the direction cosine matrix [A].\n\n\nIf the components of the.arbitrary-vector\n\nv in the\n\nxi, and\n\nXi systems\n\n\nare denoted, respectively 3 by (v) and (v) , the direction cosine matrix\n\nI\ni\nsatisfies\n(v)i\n\n= [AJ(v)l\n\n;\n\n(v),\n\n=\n\n[A]\'(v)i\n\nwhere "T" denotes the matrix transpose operation.\n\n(3)\n\nFurther, the matrix [A]\n\nis related [7] 1o the components of the angular velocity vector cited in\n(1) by\n\n\n-4\xc2\xad\n[A]\n\n[(m)][A]\n\n=-\n\n(4)\n\nwhere\n\n[ )]\n\n2\n\n- 3\n\n=\n\n-3,\n\n0\n\nWS\n-W2\n\n(5)\n\nW1i\n\n\nSince only the spin-axis orientation is significant, one\n\nextracts from (4).\n\n\n2a 3 2\n\na13\n\n=\n\na2 3\n\n= -92a 19 + cua 33\n\na 33\n\n=\n\nW2 a1 3\n\nw2a33\n\n(6)\n\n-wa23\n\n\nThese variables are not independent, since they satisty the kinematic con\xc2\xad\nstraint\n\n(7)\n\n\na1 + a23 + a,3\n\nEquations (1) and (6) constitute the system of governing equations.\n\n\nThe kinematic definition given in (6)is not restricted by either small\n\nangle approximations or by kinematic singularities.\n\nAnalytical solution\n\n\nof the state equations is expedited by restatement in the following com\xc2\xad\nplex variable format\n\n+ iafm\n\n=\n\nue in/\n\n\n+ isu - ia33W\n\n=\n\na3 3 - w2 a1 3 + wia 2 3\n\n(8)\n\n0\n=-0\n\nwhere\nW\n\n=\n\n, + i\n\n2\n\n=\n\n1\n\nei0\n\na\n\n=\n\na1 3 + ia2 3 :\n\ni\nle\n\n(9)\n\n-5-\n\nBy a suitable definition of the reference\n\nXi\n\nsystem, the general\n\n\nattitude-control problem may be expressed as the requirement that the\n\nbody-fixed\n\nx 3 axis be placed and maintained in alignment with the\n\nX3\n\n\naxis.\n\n\nNECESSARY CONDITIONS FOR UNBOUNDED, FREE-TIME, FUEL-OPTIMAL CONTROL\n\nThe problem to be examined in this section is as follows.\nthose control variables\n\nu(t), n(t)\n\nDetermine\n\n\nwhich transfer the state solutions\n\n\nfrom arbitrary initial conditions to the specified final state\n\n\nol(T)\n\n=\n\n=-\n\nw2 (T)\n\na13 (T)\n\na2 3 (T) =\n 0 - a33 (T) = 1\n\n(10)\n\nwhile minimizing the fuel-performance index\n\nJ\n\n=\n\nT\nf kudt\n\n(11)\n\n0\nIn the above, the product\n\nku\n\nu\n\nT is not specified.\n\n\n0, and the final time\n\ndefines the rate of fuel consumption where\n\n\n-The Hamiltonian function for this system is defined as\n\n\nH\n\n-ku + po(a%\n\n+ a2\n\n+ a\n\n-\n\n)\n\n+ pj(a w2 + u cos n) + p2 (-aawj + u sin z)\n\n(12)\n\n+ pa(na2j - w2a.3) + P,(-{a 13 + wla.)\n+ ps(w 2 a 3 - wlas)\n1\n\nThe costate differential equations can then be expressed as\n\n= i(aa3 q - ups)\n\n+ ia~p\n\nq + isq\nPs\n\n-\n\n-\n\niPs\n\nP3W2 + P~4W\n\n=\n\n2po(t)\n= 2p0(t)a\n33\n\n(13)\n\n-6\xc2\xad\nwhere\n\nP\n\nq = P3 + iP4\n\n\nP1 + ip2P\n\nwith the complex variables\nthe function\n\na and\n\nw defined in (9).\n\nH with respect to the control angle n is satisfied by\n\n\n-in n =\n\nP2/IPI\n\n,\n\ncos p\n\n=\n\n\n=\n\nu(-k +\n\n(14)\n\nPj/jP\n\nHence, the functional dependence of H upon\n\nH(u)\n\nThe maximum of\n\n\nu becomes\n\nIPI)\n\nu, it is necessary that\n\nFor unbounded\n\nIpI s k\n\n(15)\n\n<\nIf INp k, u = 0, while if\n\nIjpk, the\n=\n\ncontrol\n\nu can be either\n\nunbounded (impulsive control), or bounded (singular or coasting arcs,\nThe costate variables are. required to be continuous, and the Hamiltonian\nfunction must satisfy\n11(t)\n\n=\n\n0 ,\n\n006\n\nsince the final time is unspecified, and\n\nH is not an explicit function\n\n\n,of time.\n\nEXTREMAL FUEL-OPTIMAL SOLUTIONS\n\nThe nature of the extremal solutions for the system considered is\n\nmost easily explained in terms of the properties of the motion of the\n\nsystem.

In\n\nparticular, they are continuous at t,= t\'.\nCONTROL MECHANIZATION\n\nTo understand the control logic which is discussed in this section,\n\nit is worthwhile to review the following current control approach [8] em\xc2\xad\nployed for the active control of passively damped spacecraft. During the\n\nacquisition phase of control, the passive damper forces the spin-axis and\n\nmoment-of-momentum vector into coincidence, effectively eliminating\n\nfc\n\nt .\n\n\nThe reaction-jet system is then employed in an attempt to precess the\n\nspin-axis\n\nx3 towards the reference\n\nX3 axis.\n\nThiq precession is accom\xc2\xad\n\nplished by a series of impulses designed to approximate the singular arc\n\nnoted in the preceding section.\ndecrease\n\nA control impulse can either increase or\n\n\njol,nd it is generally speculated [5] that the net result of\n\na\n\na sequence of impulses is a neqliqible change in\n16I\n\n!o4;\n\nhowever, should\n\n\n(and hence 6) become too large, onesimply waits until the passive\n\n\ndamper reduces, JtJ\nmotion.\n\n\nsufficiently, and then continues forced precessional\n\n\n-12-\n\nIt is proposed that a completely active control system is near optimal\n\nwhen operated in a manner analogous to this active control of a passively\n\ndamped system.\n\nSpecifically, active control is to consist of the follow\xc2\xad\n\ning two sequential modes:\n\nMode A. Eliminate the transverse angular velocity magnitude\n\nwithout regard for position (angular orientation).\n\nMode B. Once\n\nojw is minimized by Mode A, initiate by repeated im\xc2\xad\n\npulses a transfer of x 3 towards\n\nX3 . If during this transfer\n\nImI\n\n\nand hence 6) become too large, return to Mode A.\n\nIn short, Mode. A control is an active replacement for the passive damper,\n\nand the development of such a system has been reported [9].\n\nMode B con\xc2\xad\n\ntrol logfc does not differ from existing active-control approaches for\n\npassively damped systems [8].\n\nBy following this simplified control policy,\n\n\nthe maximum increase in cost over the optimal\n\nXQ < 61\n\ncost given in (28)\n\n\nwould be\n\nAdmax\n\n=\n\nk13Q(XY\n\n+\n\nwhile the increase over the\nAJmax\n\n=\n\n0\n60) S 2k1 306\n\nX0 > 60\n\noptimal cost cited in (35) would be\n\n\n2k1 3 60\n\nHence, the average increase in fuel-consumption would be\none follows Porcelli\'s arnhiments [5) that\n\n60\n\nklp26 0 , and if\n\n\nis "small" this simplified\n\n\npolicy is seen to be quite economical.\n\nIn summary, the control mechanization suggested incorporates exist\xc2\xad\ning active coning control.systems [9] for Mode A control and existing\n\nprecessional- control approaches for Mode B control [8].\n\nSuch a control\n\n\n-13\xc2\xad\napproach will closely approximate the optimal control strategy.\n\nSin:e\n\n\nit is basically a geometric control concept, it would be relatively\n\ninsensitive to inertia ratios, and could be adapted to any axisymmetric\n\nconfiguration of interest (including time-varying systems),\n\nSUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nExtremal solutions are developed herein for the unbounded, free-time,\n\nfuel-optimal control of an axisymmetric spinning body. The optimal con\xc2\xad\ntrol strategy is shown to be quite similar to existing control policies\n\nwhich have been separately developed for coning \xc2\xa39] and precessional [8]\n\ncontrol, and a suboptimal control policy is proposedwhich makes use of\n\nthese existing control approaches.\n\nThe control approach is conceptually\n\n\nadequate for arbitrary initial errors, arbitrary (but non-spherical)\n\naxisymmetric inertia properties, and can be realized with one body-fixed\n\nreaction jet.\n\nPossible extensions of this work include analysis of asymmetric spint\n\nstabilized vehicles, and the development of additional extremal solutions\n\nfor the present problem. Specifically, small angle analyses suggest the\n\npresence of another type of singular arc for control of the form\n\nu(t)\nfor\n\n0\n= -Uei(e -at)\n\n\nQO < 6o initial conditions with a costate solution similar to (27).\n\n\n-14-\n\nREFERENCES\n\n1. \t\nWindeknecht, T.

Introduction\n\nTechniques involving range only data for orbit determination have\n\nbeen investigated by several researchers in the past.\n\nThe method of\n\n\nR. M. L. Baker, Jr., based on the synthesis of the classical f and g\n\nseries of celestial mechanics with certain unified formulae developed by\n\nS. Herrick, has been applied to range only orbit determination using\n\nground-based tracking stations [Baker].\n\nThe technique does not give\n\n\nadequate information for orbit determination when the tracking stations\n\nare near the poles or equator.\n\nIn addition, the ground based tracking\n\n\nstations provide limited coverage.\n\nConsequently some investigations into\n\n\nthe use of space-based tracking stations have been conducted.\n\nThe feasi\xc2\xad\n\nbility of using range only data to determine circular orbits has been\n\ndemonstrated [Ball].\n\nThe possibility of using range and range rate in\xc2\xad\n\nformation and combining tracking data obtained from satellites with ground\n\nbased data to improve orbit determination accuracy has also been investi\xc2\xad\ngated [Johnson, Mullin, and Steiner].\n\nThe purpose of this research has been to develop a general method\n\nfor determining the orbit of a target satellite from range only data\n\nobtained from a single space-based tracking station.\n\n\n2.

Then\n\nthe more general case of an elliptical non-equatorial earth synchronous\n\ntracking satellite was considered\n\nto compare the results obtained with\n\n\na ground-based tracking station, and to track a geostationary target\n\nsatellite.\n\nIn all cases the observed ranges were simulated by a program\n\n\nwritten in double precision for FORTRAN IV on a CDC 6400 digital computer.\n\nThe entire orbit determination program was also written in double\n\nprecision because of the number of trigonometric functions involved in\n\nthe expressions and the similarity of the observed values of p, and\n\nto diminish the detrimental effect of truncation in calculation and to\n\navoid difficulty in performing inversion of the normal matrix.\n\n\n-9-\n\nThe program started from.approximate values of components of position\n\nand velocity vectors of the target satellite at time to = T + 1800 seconds\n\nTrue Position and Velocity\nrx = -0.3115940360324\n\nApproximate Position and Velocity\n\nrx = -0.33\n(radii)\n\n\nry\n\n= -1.0161619714329\n\nry\n\n= -0.96\n\n(radii)\n\n\nrz\n\n=\n\n1.1516722843306\n\nrz\n\n=\n\n1.00\n\n(radii)\n\n\nVx\n\n=\n\n0.0004110148706\n\nVx\n\n=\n\n0.00038\n\n(radii/sec)\n\n\nVY = -0.0007627143063\n\nVY\n = -0.00078\n\n(radii/sec)\n\n\nVz\n\nVz\n\n(radii/sec)\n\n\n= -0.0004996964384\n\n= -0.00052\n\nUsing well-known formulas one can obtain the first estimates for\n\norbital elements of the target satellite as\n\na = 1.3559298580661\ne =\n\n(radii)\n\n\n.0878878577706\n\n\ni = 1.1232204187772\n\n(radian)\n\n\n= 1.7322918670788\n\n(radian)\n\n\nw = -0.0091516259974\n\n(radian)\n\n\nT = -896.7222616242500\n\n(sec.)\n\n\nAll range residuals were reduced to a value smaller than 10-13\n\n.\n\n\nUsing ten observations with a 100-sec interval between two observations,\n\nafter six iterations the best estimates for the orbital elements of the\n\ntarget satellite were\n\na\n\n= \n\n\n1.5999999996368\n\n(radii)\n\n\ne = 0.0499999999891\n\ni = 1.1389909994616\n\n(radian)\n\n\n= 1.7960649999600\nto\n\n(radian)\n\n= 1.0048649967139\n\n(radian)\n\nT = -0.0000051365072\n\n(sec.)\n\n-1o-\n\nThe effects of the number of observations and the time interval used\n\nwere also considered in this study, and gave the following results;\n\n1. \t\nThe value of the normal matrix increases as the number of\n\nobservations increases (i.e., when the number of observations,\n\nchanges from 10 to 20, with the same time interval, the value\n\nof the normal matrix changes from 10-35 to 10-24); that\n\nfacilitates the inversion process and allows larger (or\n\nsmaller) guesses for the first estimates of the orbital\n\nelements.\n\n2. \t\nWith the same number of observations and iterations, the\n\naccuracy increases slightly as the time interval increases\n\n(Table I).\n\n3. \t\nSmall time intervals (less than about 10 sec.) must be\n\navoided in order that the ranges vary significantly enough\n\nso that the inversion of the normal matrix is possible.\n\nThe \t ethod also works well for different values of inclination angle of\n\nm\nthe target satellite orbit plane, including I = 90\' .\n\nFor i = 0, the tracking satellite should be in a slightly inclined\norbit so that\n\njo-_\nai\n0, making\n\nthe Inversion of the normal matrix possible.\n\n\n-II\xc2\xad\n\n10 observations & after 3 iterations\n\n40-sec interval\n\n60-sec interval\n\n100-sec interval\n\n\na\n\n1.5999993646172\n\n1.5999998812537\n\n1.5999999851120\n\n\ne\n\n0.0499999675940\n\n0.0499999664185\n\n0.0500000005377\n\n\n1\n\n1.1389894947893\n\n1.1389906906153\n\n1.1389909143707\n\n\na\n\n1.7960647775925\n\n1.7960649476248\n\n1.7960649987362\n\n\nW\n\n1.0048618674775\n\n1.0048645161761\n\n1.0048650009421\n\n\nT -0.0056788572160\n\n-0.0009357441760\n\n-0.0000297907105\n\n\nTable 1.
