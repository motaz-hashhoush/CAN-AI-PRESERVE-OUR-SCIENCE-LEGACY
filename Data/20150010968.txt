The gravity tractor is one\ntechnique that uses the gravitational attraction of a rendezvous spacecraft to the\nimpactor and a low-thrust, high-efficiency propulsion system to provide a gradual\nvelocity change and alter its trajectory. An innovation to this technique, known as the\nEnhanced Gravity Tractor (EGT), uses mass collected in-situ to augment the mass of\nthe spacecraft, thereby greatly increasing the gravitational force between the objects.\nThe collected material can be a single boulder, multiple boulders, regolith or a\ncombination of different sources. The collected mass would likely range from tens to\nhundreds of metric tons depending on the size of the impactor and warning time\navailable. Depending on the propulsion system\xe2\x80\x99s capability and the mass collected,\nthe EGT approach can reduce the deflection times by a factor of 10 to 50 or more,\nthus reducing the deflection times of several decades to years or less and overcoming\nthe main criticism of the traditional gravity tractor approach. Additionally, multiple\nspacecraft can orbit the target in formation to provide the necessary velocity change\nand further reduce the time needed by the EGT technique to divert hazardous\nasteroids and comets. The robotic segment of NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Asteroid Redirect Mission\n(ARM) will collect a multi-ton boulder from the surface of a large Near-Earth Asteroid\n(NEA) and will provide the first ever demonstration of the EGT technique and validate\none method of collecting in-situ mass on an asteroid of hazardous size.\n\n1\n\nBackground\nA variety of techniques have been proposed to deflect asteroids and comets that could\nimpact the Earth and cause destruction and loss of life. Efforts to deflect these\nhazardous Near-Earth Objects (NEOs) significantly benefit from early detection and\nprecise orbit characterization. Warning times on the order of a decade or more\nsignificantly reduce the impulse, or velocity change (\xe2\x88\x86V), needed to deflect an\nimpacting NEO. Accurate knowledge of the object\xe2\x80\x99s orbit is needed to confirm that the\nobject will indeed impact the Earth, which is possible with a sufficient number of\naccurate astrometric observations along with the possible addition of precise radar\nmeasurements or the presence of an in-situ spacecraft. As shown in Figure 1, the\napplication of approximately one cm/s (0.022 mph) of \xe2\x88\x86V a decade before impact is\ntypically required to allow for a one Earth radius deflection. This would be the minimum\nimpulse required to just avoid a worst case impact that hits the Earth \xe2\x80\x9cdead center.\xe2\x80\x9d\nAdditional \xe2\x88\x86V would be required for margin against the orbit uncertainty or the NEO\xe2\x80\x99s\norbit would need to be more of a grazing impact to assure that the object misses the\nEarth. This \xe2\x88\x86V increases by approximately an order of magnitude within a year of\nimpact, and surpasses a meter per second in the last months before impact.\n\n10\n\n2\n\n10\n\n1\n\n10\n\nMinimum V (cm/sec)\n\n10\n\nAten-type Asteroid : a=0.9AU, e=0.4, i=0deg\nApollo-type Asteroid : a=1.5AU, e=0.5, i=0deg\nShort period Comet : a=4.0AU, e=0.85, i=0deg\nLong period Comet: a=40.0AU, e=0.985, i=0deg\n\n3\n\n0\n\n-1\n\n10\n-10\n\n-9\n\n-8\n-7\n-6\n-5\n-4\n-3\n-2\nTime before Collision when V is Applied (years)\n\n-1\n\n0\n\nFigure 1: Estimated Minimum \xe2\x88\x86V Required to Deflect Example\nImpactors by One Earth Radius for Pre-Perihelion Impact (Credit: Ref. [1]).\n\nPlanetary defense techniques that can provide large, rapid impulses, such as kinetic\nimpactors and nuclear detonations, require the least amount of warning time, but their\neffectiveness is dependent on the NEO properties, which are likely uncertain and vary\nsubstantially between objects. Additionally, the application of a large, concentrated\nforce has the potential to fragment the NEO due to the unknown structure and\nmechanical properties of the target. These fragments could still be dangerous if they\n2\n\nremain on an impacting trajectory with Earth. Techniques that can provide small,\ngentle impulses are much less likely to cause fragmentation, but typically require much\nlonger interaction times (months to many years) to provide the necessary \xe2\x88\x86V to deflect\nthe impacting object. These \xe2\x80\x9cslow push/pull\xe2\x80\x9d techniques typically work by enhancing\nnatural effects (e.g., albedo/thermal response modification via the Yarkovsky effect),\nby the ablation/expulsion of surface material, or by applying a contact or gravitational\nforce. They are also effective against NEOs that are binary or even ternary systems.\nOne consideration for these gradual deflection techniques is that when an impact with\nthe Earth is confirmed, the exact impact point is still uncertain. This path of possible\nimpact points, known as the \xe2\x80\x9crisk corridor,\xe2\x80\x9d is altered during a deflection effort with the\nimpact point moving across the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s surface as the impactor\xe2\x80\x99s trajectory is slowly\nchanged (see Figure 2 for an example). Choosing how the deflection is accomplished\nhas significant geopolitical considerations and will likely require the cooperation of\nmultiple nations. Finally, definitive knowledge that an impact will actually occur is often\ndifficult to determine from ground-based measurements and the probability of impact\nwill likely not be a certainty before a deflection mission is undertaken.\nThe gravity tractor is a planetary defense technique that uses the gravitational\nattraction between a rendezvous spacecraft and the NEO to gradually alter the\ntrajectory of an impactor [2]. With this approach, the spacecraft maintains separation\nfrom the NEO by using its thrusters to oppose the small gravitational attraction\nbetween the two bodies without pluming the NEO, which reduces the technique\xe2\x80\x99s\neffectiveness. The gravity tractor requires the use of a low-thrust, high-efficiency\npropulsion system, such as Solar Electric Propulsion (SEP), to balance the\ngravitational force while minimizing the propellant required for the deflection. With this\ntechnique, the NEO is accelerated in a very uniform manner with only extremely small\ntidal forces causing any internal structural stresses. One of the shortcomings of the\ntraditional gravity tractor approach is that the applied force is exceedingly small and\ndepends on the mass of the spacecraft. This results in many years or decades of\noperation to alter the impactor\xe2\x80\x99s trajectory and a decade or more of warning time.\n\nFigure 2: Example Potential Impact Path or \xe2\x80\x9c Risk Corridor\xe2\x80\x9d\n(Credit: NASA/JPL and Google Earth).\n\n3\n\nIntroduction\nThe National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) is currently developing a\nmission concept known as the Asteroid Redirect Mission (ARM), which includes the\ngoal of robotically returning a multi-ton boulder (typically 2-4 meters in size) from a\nlarge Near-Earth Asteroid (NEA), 100 meters or greater in size, to cislunar space using\nan advanced 50 kW-class Solar Electric Propulsion (SEP) spacecraft designated the\nAsteroid Redirect Vehicle (ARV). After the ARV returns to a lunar distant retrograde\norbit (LDRO) in the mid 2020\xe2\x80\x99s, initial astronaut exploration and sampling of the\nreturned material will take place as part of ARM. Subsequent human and robotic\nmissions to the asteroidal material would also be facilitated by its return to cislunar\nspace and would benefit scientific and partnership interests, expanding our knowledge\nof small celestial bodies and enabling the demonstration of mining of asteroid\nresources for commercial and exploration needs. The capabilities, systems, and\noperational experience developed and implemented by ARM and subsequent\nmissions to the returned asteroidal material will advance NASA\'s goal of sending\nhumans to deep-space destinations and eventually to surface of Mars. The robotic\nmission will also permit the demonstration of planetary defense techniques.\nThe robotic mission to capture a multi-ton boulder from the surface of a large NEA [3]\nis depicted in Figure 3. The maximum boulder mass that can be returned is currently\nlimited by the ARV xenon propellant capacity (~10 t) and the target asteroids available\nwith orbits that allow returns in the mid-2020 time period. The maximum returnable\nmass is currently estimated to be approximately 40 metric tons. The capture system\ndesign has focused on retrieving a boulder that is 1-4 meters in size (up to a mass of\n~70 t), but the design can be scaled to accommodate significantly larger boulders.\nThis option includes the opportunity to demonstrate future planetary defense\nstrategies on a hazardous-sized NEA. Inspired by the mission requirement to collect\na boulder from the asteroid and thus dramatically augment the rendezvous spacecraft\nmass with in-situ material, the idea of the Enhanced Gravity Tractor (EGT) technique\nwas conceived.\n\nFigure 3: ARM Robotic Mission (Image Credit: NASA/AMA, Inc.).\n\n4\n\nEGT uses mass collected in-situ to augment the mass of the spacecraft, thereby\ngreatly increasing the gravitational force between the objects. The collected material\ncan be a single boulder, multiple boulders, regolith or a combination of different\nmaterial types using a variety of collection techniques, including the use of a separable\nspacecraft to \xe2\x80\x9charvest\xe2\x80\x9d the material. Since the material would not need to be returned\nto Earth for an actual deflection mission, significantly more mass could be collected to\nprovide mass augmentation than can be achieved during the ARM robotic mission.\nThe mass of the collected material for actual planetary defense effort would likely\nrange from tens to many hundreds of metric tons based on the size of the impactor\nand warning time available. Depending on the SEP system\xe2\x80\x99s capability (i.e., power,\nthrust, and propellant) and the mass collected, the EGT approach can reduce the\ndeflection times by a factor of 10 to 50 or more over the standard gravity tractor\nmethod, thus reducing the deflection times of several decades to years or less. The\nARM robotic mission will provide the first ever demonstration of the EGT technique on\na hazardous-sized asteroid and validate one method of collecting in-situ mass.\nDue to the collisional nature of how NEAs are created, the presence of retrievable\nmaterial is a virtual certainty. Although the EGT does require some period of\ninteraction with the target, the vast majority of the time is spent in the gravity tractoring\nmode, which is done without direct contact. This paper describes a simple, single\nspacecraft EGT methodology to explain the basic concept. There are many possible\napproaches and synergies that could significantly increase the effectiveness of the\nEGT that are available for further investigation. For example, the use of one or more\nseparable spacecraft to collect and aggregate asteroidal material, along with an\nenhanced, higher power version of the ARV to act as the EGT \xe2\x80\x9ctug,\xe2\x80\x9d would greatly\nincrease the effectiveness of the technique and provide additional mission robustness.\nAdditionally, the efforts to extract and retrieve resources from large asteroids for future\nexploration and commercial mining efforts would greatly increase our capability to\nobtain the necessary mass for an EGT deflection effort against a future Earth impactor.\nFinally, the ability of multiple spacecraft to orbit the target in formation to provide the\nnecessary velocity change can further reduce the time needed by the EGT technique\nto divert hazardous NEOs. These are just a few examples. Many other ideas,\nincluding combining EGT with other deflection techniques, are possible.\nConcept of Operations\nOnce in the proximity of a hazardous NEO, the EGT operations consist of five phases:\n1.) initial orbit determination; 2.) characterization; 3.) material collection; 4.) tractoring;\nand 5.) final orbit determination. Having a spacecraft near the asteroid allows for very\nprecise orbit determination and confirmation that the threat is an impactor prior to any\ninteraction with the asteroid. If an impact is confirmed, the spacecraft can facilitate a\nrefinement of the \xe2\x88\x86V required in order to avoid a direct impact or any gravitational\nkeyhole passages [4] that could result in an Earth impact during a subsequent\nencounter. Orbit determination can begin hundreds of kilometers from the asteroid\nand continue throughout the characterization phase. The characterization phase will\nbegin during the initial approach and provide a detailed gravity field, shape model, and\nimagery of the asteroid. The imagery will be used to identify boulders and other\nasteroidal material to be collected. Gravity and shape models will be used by the\nspacecraft\xe2\x80\x99s guidance and navigation system during the collection phase.\n5\n\nMaterial collection operations will depend on the spacecraft capabilities, as well as the\ntargeted material to be collected. Depending on the type of asteroid, pre-launch\nknowledge and imagery of the surface, the size of the asteroid, estimates of required\n\xe2\x88\x86V, warning time, and the amount and type of material (single boulder, multiple\nboulders, regolith, etc.) can vary. While this paper will not discuss in detail all of the\npossible capture mechanisms and operations, it should be noted that it is desirable to\nhave a robust collection capability to sufficiently augment the mass of the spacecraft.\n\nSpacecraft +\nMaterial\nd\n\nAsteroid\n\nSide View\n\nAfter collecting and securely restraining the\nasteroidal material, the spacecraft enters\nthe tractoring phase. The EGT tractoring\noperations are similar to the standard\ngravity tractor with the spacecraft\nmaintaining a constant distance (d) from\nthe asteroid, countering the gravitational\nattraction by thrusting away from the\nasteroid with an equal force. Stationkeeping to maintain the desired orbit for\nany EGT method requires active navigation\nand awareness of the spacecraft\xe2\x80\x99s\nrelationship to the asteroid.\n\nOne way to achieve this standoff is having\nthe spacecraft maintain a position along\nthe asteroid\xe2\x80\x99s orbital velocity vector [2].\nFigure 4: In-line Tractoring Method.\nThis in-line method, as shown in Figure 4,\nprovides a simple navigation strategy with constant line of sight to the asteroid for\nrange and position measurements. The thrust can then be adjusted to maintain the\ndesired position. However, this method also requires canting of the thrusters in order\nto avoid pluming the asteroid. This requires additional propellant along with higher\nthrust to account for the cosine losses and thus increased power for electric propulsion\n(EP) system, or increased distance from the asteroid which would reduce the\ngravitational attraction and thus increase the deflection time.\nOther methods have been proposed to increase the efficiency of tractoring. One of\nthe most prominent is the spiral method [5]. Figure 5 depicts this method in which the\nspacecraft enters a halo-like orbit around the asteroid\xe2\x80\x99s velocity vector, creating a\nspiraling orbit when viewed in a sun-centered frame. This allows the spacecraft to\ndecrease the distance (d) to the asteroid and increase the gravitational attraction while\navoiding pluming the surface or requiring canting of the thrusters. By eliminating\ncanting and setting the orbital period such that the centripetal acceleration counters\nthe off-axis components of the gravitational force, the thrust required is equal to the\nnet force along the velocity vector (\xed\x91\xa3 This allows the full thrust capability of the\n\xe2\x83\x91).\nspacecraft to be utilized in the deflection of the asteroid. The maximum deflection\nforce is now a function of the mass that is collected and the minimum distance to the\nasteroid is set by risk posture, with thruster characteristics (e.g., plume angle,\nmaximum cant angle, etc.) being a secondary consideration. While there are cosine\nlosses introduced by the spacecraft not being aligned with the velocity vector because\nthe resulting gravitational force is along the NEO-to-spacecraft line, these loses are\n6\n\novercome by the increased force as the spacecraft decreases the range to the asteroid\nwhich has inverse square relationship.\n\nSpacecraft + Material\n\nSpacecraft +\nMaterial\n\nThruster Plume\n\nd\n\nAsteroid\n\nFront View\n\nSide View\n\nFigure 5: Spiral Tractoring Method.\n\nAsteroid Redirect Mission EGT Demonstration\nThe ARM robotic mission [3] would demonstrate the EGT spiral method and one\nmethod of collecting material from a hazardous-sized NEA. Due to the mission\nobjective of returning the collected boulder to the Earth-Moon system, this mission will\nnot have the time nor mass collection capability to impart a \xe2\x88\x86V of the magnitude that\nwould be required for an actual deflection mission. However, all phases of the EGT\noperations will be demonstrated, including producing a deflection which is large\nenough to measure either with the vehicle still in the asteroid\xe2\x80\x99s vicinity [6] or via groundbased radar measurements if possible.\nAssuming the target asteroid hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been visited by a precursor mission, which would\nprovide shape and gravity models as well as detailed imagery, the ARV will spend\napproximately 14 days during initial approach to transition from a 1,000 km acquisition\npoint to 100 km range. During this time, initial shape and gravity models will be\ndeveloped and imagery will be gathered to begin identifying potential landing sites.\nOver approximately the next five weeks, a series of six fly-bys will be conducted with\na close approach range of one km and relative velocities decreasing from a meter per\nsecond to approximately 0.1 m/s. The first four fly-bys are targeted over different\nlatitudes to build a detailed gravity model and gather <10 cm resolution global imagery.\nA two week hold will be used to process the data and imagery and identify potential\ncollection sites to be targeted during the final two fly-bys. A final two-week hold will\nthen be used to identify and prioritize three collection sites. Three sites are chosen to\nprotect against the unknowns of the surface and boulder characteristics. A total of five\ncollection attempts and three dry-run sequences over different collection sites have\nbeen budgeted.\nThe collection process begins with a series of dry-runs that are used to test and\ndemonstrate the navigation and control systems. The ARV will rely on optical TerrainRelative Navigation (TRN) that will track landmarks that are mapped during the fly7\n\nbys. The first dry-run will start at a range of 5 km and follow a passively safe trajectory\nto an altitude of ~200 m. During this dry-run, both the LIDAR and TRN systems will\nbe able to develop solutions that will be tracked prior to the execution of a pre-planned\nmaneuver at the end of the dry-run. Once the navigation system performance is\ndemonstrated, the second dry-run will follow the same passively safe trajectory but\nthen continue to descend down to an altitude of 50 m. At that altitude, the ARV will\nmatch spin rates with the asteroid and maintain a stationary position relative to the\ntarget boulder for 10 minutes to demonstrate the TRN filter and the control algorithms\nthat will be required for the final descent.\nThe final descent will again follow the same passively safe trajectory down to 50 m\naltitude at which point the ARV will maintain a local vertical descent through\ntouchdown. During the final 20 m, use of the thrusters that plume toward the surface\nwill be limited to attitude control only with no vertical velocity control in order to\nminimize any disturbance to the surface. At touchdown, the residual velocity will be\nattenuated by the Capture and Restraint System (CRS) [7]. While on the surface, as\ndepicted in Figure 6, the CRS will provide stability while a small downward thrust is\nmaintained in order to increase the downward force in the extremely low-gravity\nenvironment. Two robotic arms with microspine grippers with anchoring drills [8] will\nthen grasp the boulder prior to the CRS providing a mechanical push-off that will\nseparate the boulder from the surface, breaking any cohesion, and provide an initial\nascent without pluming the surface. Once the ARV and boulder are clear of the\nsurface, a propulsive maneuver will be performed to achieve a slow drift from the\nasteroid while the boulder will then be secured and a series of small maneuvers will\nbe performed to determine the mass properties of the combined boulder and ARV.\n\nFigure 6: Capture System during Capture Operations (Image Credit: NASA/AMA, Inc.).\n\nWith the boulder restrained and the mass properties updated, as depicted in Figure 7,\nthe ARV begins to transit to an initial EGT spiral orbit. Much like the boulder collection\ndry-runs, prior to entering the final EGT orbit the ARV will demonstrate the EGT\noperations in an orbit with a range of one kilometer. This initial orbit will be held for\nabout a week to demonstrate the TRN acquisition, control algorithms, and stationkeeping operations. The ARV will then transition to the final EGT orbit which will have\na minimum altitude of one asteroid radius. During the EGT orbit, the ARV will track\nlandmarks through the onboard TRN over two imaging arcs that occur just after\n8\n\ncrossing the terminator plane onto the illuminated side of the asteroid and just prior to\ncrossing the terminator plane into eclipse. These imaging arcs will allow the system\nto precisely determine the ARV\xe2\x80\x99s state and calculate any required updates to maintain\nthe desired EGT orbit.\n\nFigure 7: ARV with Captured and Restrained Boulder ready for EGT Operations\n(Image Credit: NASA/AMA, Inc.).\n\nThis final orbit will be held for a pre-determined amount of time ranging from\napproximately 30-90 days depending on the target asteroid and collected boulder\nmass. This will provide a small deflection, limited by the propellant and time\nconstraints of the ARM robotic mission, while not drastically altering the trajectory of\nthe hazardous-sized target. The ARV will then maneuver to a stand-off location where\nit will wait an additional four to five months for the deflection to propagate. This will\nallow the asteroid to achieve advantageous Earth alignment for deflection verification,\nwhich will be accomplished using ground ranging to the ARV combined with precise\nranging from the ARV to the asteroid. Once the deflection is verified to beyond a threesigma uncertainty, the ARV and captured boulder will begin the transit to back to the\nEarth-Moon system. Depending on the target asteroid\xe2\x80\x99s future Earth approaches and\ntractoring time available, there may be the opportunity to observe the deflection using\nEarth-based radar, allowing the ARV to begin the return transit prior to verification.\nComparison of Traditional and Enhanced Gravity Tractor Techniques\nCompared to standard gravity tractor operations, without augmenting the mass [2,5,9],\nthe EGT is more effective, and thus, requires less time to achieve the same amount\nof deflection. Since the gravitational acceleration imparted on the asteroid is\nindependent of the asteroid mass, a simple consideration would expect the benefit to\nbe constant and equal to the ratio of the spacecraft mass to the mass of the spacecraft\nplus collected material up to the point that the gravitational force reaches that\nmaximum thrust capability of the SEP system. However, Figures 8 and 9 show that\nthe deflection time benefit provided by EGT over gravity tractor is not just a function of\ncollected mass and SEP power available for thrusting, but also the asteroid size. This\nis a result of the characteristics of the propulsion system. Assuming a constant\nasteroid density, as the asteroid size increases the thrust required to counteract the\ngravitational attraction increases. This increase in required thrust is provided by\nincreased mass flow through the propulsion system and therefore more propellant\nusage. Including this propellant and accompanying increased tankage in the mass of\nthe spacecraft introduces an asteroid size dependency in the ratio of the EGT to the\nGT systems which produce the slopes seen in the figures.\n9\n\nAs shown in Figure 8, almost 30 times less time is needed for a 200 m spherical\nasteroid (assuming a density of 2 g/cm3) with a 50 kW EGT system that has a 4,000\nkg dry mass and 500 t of collected material. As the asteroid increases in size, the\npropellant required increases the mass of the GT at a proportionately higher rate than\nthe EGT. This leads to the slow reduction in benefit seen. However, even at these\nlower power levels the EGT can reduce deflection times by one to two orders of\nmagnitude for smaller asteroids, which are much more numerous and harder to target\nwith kinetic impactor techniques because of their size. Figure 9 shows that using the\nEGT with a 300 kW SEP system and 500 t of collected mass provides almost a factor\nof 50 reduction in deflection time for a 300 m diameter asteroid. If the collected mass\nis reduced to 100 t, the EGT is still almost 10 times more efficient. As asteroids get\nlarger, these numbers decrease, but even for a 500 m asteroid, the EGT method with\n500 t of material can reduce the deflection time by a factor of approximately 15.\nThe impact of SEP power and thrust can easily be seen by comparing Figure 10 with\nFigure 11, which provide an estimate of the EGT deflection time (years) and propellant\n(metric tons of xenon) required for a given diameter asteroid. The gravitational force\nis proportional to the product of the asteroid mass and the combined mass of the\nspacecraft and collected material, and it is also equal to the thrust required to maintain\nthe relative standoff position and thus impart the \xe2\x88\x86V on the asteroid. As one or both\nof these masses increase to the point the gravitational attraction equals the maximum\nthrust capability of the spacecraft, the spacecraft then must move further away from\nasteroid to decrease the attraction to a point where it can be balanced by the thrust.\nThis decreases the efficiency of the tractoring and provides a limit that can be seen as\nthe lines converge. This also leads to the observation that for larger asteroids the EGT\ndoes not provide a benefit over the standard gravity tractor without additional thrust\ncapability. This asteroid size is a function of the vehicle thrust. For a 50 kW system\nwith a nominal dry mass of 4,000 kg that provides 1.63 N of thrust, this limit is reached\nwith a 650 m diameter asteroid (assuming a density of 2 g/cm 3). Keeping these\nassumptions while increasing the power to 300 kW and the thrust to 9.78 N, the limit\nis increased to over 1000 meters.\nThere are a few additional, and more subtle, aspects of this comparison. One is the\nminimum allowable range from the spacecraft to the asteroid. For the plots shown, a\nminimum range of one asteroid radius above the assumed spherical asteroid\xe2\x80\x99s surface\nwas maintained. When this range is combined with the assumed plume divergence\nhalf angle of 20 deg., the cosine losses of the gravitational attraction that are inherent\nto the halo orbit method are set and add another dependence on the asteroid\xe2\x80\x99s radius.\nAnother is the dependency of the SEP specific impulse (Isp) on the throttle setting. This\nanalysis assumed standard SEP throttle curves and a SEP system consisting of four\nthrusters that can produce a total 1.63 N. At maximum thrust, the SEP operates at\nmaximum efficiency, however as the SEP is forced to operate at lower throttle settings,\nthe Isp decreases. As the asteroid size increases, more thrust is required and the SEP\nthrusters can be used closer to their optimal efficiency which leads to the dips seen in\nFigures 10 and 11, most notably in the standard GT time curves. While these variables\ndo have some impact on the EGT effectiveness, they are much smaller than the overall\nthrust level of the spacecraft or the ability to collect more mass, which is seen by the\ndips almost disappearing once the EGT collects a mass of 50 metric tons or more.\n\n10\n\nFigure 8: EGT Deflection Time Reduction Factor Compared to\nStandard Gravity Tractor for 50 kW SEP System.\n\nFigure 9: EGT Deflection Time Reduction Factor Compared to\nStandard Gravity Tractor for 300 kW SEP System.\n\nIt can be observed in Figures 10 and 11 that the amount of SEP propellant required\nfor the EGT is relatively insensitive to the amount of mass collected. Expanded scales\nfor asteroids up to 400 m are shown in Figures 12 and 13. Figure 12 shows that even\na 50 kW EGT system can allow deflection times of less than a year for impactors up\nto ~175 m in diameter. The standard gravity tractor requires 18 years for a 100 m\nimpactor (red line in upper left-hand corner). Figure 13 shows that the xenon\npropellant for the EGT is significantly lower than the standard gravity tractor, due to\nthe EGT operating at a higher thrust and Isp. The current ARV with a maximum Isp of\n11\n\n3,000 seconds and propellant capacity of 10 t would permit deflections of asteroids\napproaching 300 m depending on the amount of propellant needed to reach the target.\nIncreasing the Isp while still providing sufficient thrust levels would be needed to reduce\nthe propellant loads required, which likely become prohibitive, along with deflection\ntime for the larger asteroids with lower SEP power. Going to higher power SEP\nsystems, which is the goal of future human exploration architectures, can increase the\nsize of asteroid targets as shown in Figure 11. Finally, it should also be noted that the\nabove analysis did not assume a specific orbit and therefore did not adjust the power\nand thrust available based on solar range. The power and thrust levels stated are the\nassumed power and thrust levels during the entirety of the EGT operations.\n\nFigure 10: EGT Deflection Time and Propellant for 50 kW EGT System.\n\nFigure 11: EGT Deflection Time and Propellant for 300 kW EGT System.\n\n12\n\nFigure 12: Expanded Scale of Deflection Time for 50 kW EGT System.\n\nFigure 13: Expanded Scale of Propellant Required for 50 kW EGT System.\n\nMass Collection Options\nFrom all the data collected over natural bodies greater than 100 m in size, such as\nnatural moons and asteroids, there are an abundance of boulders and regolith littered\non their surfaces [10,11,12,13]. Hence designing a spacecraft that is capable of insitu mass collection is a natural choice for deflecting asteroids using the EGT method.\nThe in-situ utilization of the native asteroid also has the obvious advantage of avoiding\nthe launch and delivery to the asteroid of a spacecraft with the equivalent mass of the\nEGT.\n13\n\nMass for an EGT deflection mission can be collected in the form of boulders, rocks, or\nregolith from the asteroid surface using a variety of options with the goal of collecting\nas much mass as needed to maximize the effectiveness of the technique and minimize\noperational complexity and risk. To achieve this, several collection options are\nconceptualized.\nConcept 1 \xe2\x80\x93 Collecting a Single Boulder\nIn the ARM robotic mission concept, the capture system is being designed to capture\na single coherent boulder with a maximum mass of 70 metric tons. The collection of\na single boulder of this size and mass is adequate for a demonstration mission, but\nfuture planetary defense missions would benefit from being designed to capture a\nlarger, more massive boulder in order to achieve the necessary deflection in a given\nwarning time. The ARV capture system is scalable to larger boulders, with a boulder\non the order of 10 meters in size required to provide approximately 1,000 metric tons\nof in-situ mass.\nConcept 2 \xe2\x80\x93 Collecting Multiple Boulders\nThe second concept is a natural extension of the boulder collection functionality\ndemonstrated by the ARM robotic mission \xe2\x80\x93 being capable of collecting multiple\nboulders. Since the boulders are scattered on the asteroid surface, the spacecraft still\npicks up one boulder at a time. During the characterization phase, the spacecraft\nsurveys the asteroid surface and maps out the locations of the target boulders and the\nassociated local terrains. A number of boulders are selected based on the estimated\nsizes and masses, and the sequence of collection is determined. During the collection\nphase, the spacecraft approaches and lands at the first boulder site, and after one\nboulder is secured proceeds to hop to the next boulder, and so on. In the micro-gravity\nenvironment in the vicinity of an asteroid, hopping between boulders is not expensive\nin terms of fuel consumption. For example, it takes as little as approximately 0.28 m/s\nof \xe2\x88\x86V to escape the gravity well of asteroid 2008 EV5, which is approximately 205 m\nin radius, and hopping on the surface takes far less \xe2\x88\x86V than that. This concept is\nillustrated in Figure 14.\nThe single spacecraft design reduces mission complexity compared to concepts\ninvolving multiple spacecraft. However, there are significant challenges associated\nwith this concept. First, the spacecraft has multiple capture mechanisms, and each of\nthem has to function individually without interference. Depending on the size of the\nboulders, this can be challenging. Second, maintaining proper attitude to capture a\nboulder with other boulders without precisely known mass properties in tow is a\nchallenging problem. Again, depending on the size of the boulders, the spacecraft\nmay have to be tilted when approaching and capturing a different boulder, which may\nbe limited physically because of the large solar arrays. Third, the Guidance,\nNavigation, and Control (GN&C) can be challenging. The dynamics associated with\nhopping combined with robotic capture mechanisms with large masses and the\npresence of large solar arrays are complicated. The sensor fields of view may become\nobscured by captured boulders, so additional maneuvers such as reorientations may\nneed to be performed before approaching the subsequent boulders. Finally,\nsignificant portions of these operations will have to be performed autonomously due\nto the inherent communication delays.\n14\n\nFigure 14: Illustration of Single Spacecraft Picking up Multiple Boulders.\n\nConcept 3 \xe2\x80\x93 Separable Collection Spacecraft and SEP Tug\nThe third concept attempts to address some of the challenges associated with using\na single spacecraft to pick up multiple boulders by utilizing two spacecraft. The main\nSEP spacecraft, or \xe2\x80\x9cmother ship\xe2\x80\x9d does not go down to the asteroid\xe2\x80\x99s surface. This\nspacecraft is designated as a SEP tug and remains in proximity to the asteroid. A\nsmaller spacecraft is designed for the single purpose of collecting regolith or capturing\nboulders and ferries between the surface and the SEP tug and transfers the acquired\nmaterial to the mother ship. The collection spacecraft can be equipped with a smaller\ncapture mechanism and does not require the large solar arrays that are needed by the\nSEP tug to power the ion engines. Therefore, it can be smaller, less massive, and\nmore maneuverable than a single spacecraft that must perform both the collection and\ntractoring functions. This concept is illustrated in Figure 15.\nThe SEP tug will need to station-keep at some acceptable distance from the asteroid\nand must have the capability to receive and store the regolith and/or boulders\ndelivered by the collection spacecraft. The SEP tug can hover over the collection sites\nto provide accessibility for material transfer or it can hover over the polar region to\nminimize the propellant required for matching the rotation of the asteroid while\nhovering, provided that the asteroid is a single-axis rotator. After enough mass is\ncollected, the SEP tug moves into position for EGT.\nThe smaller and specialized collection spacecraft greatly reduces the challenges\nassociated with the surface operations, including maneuvering and collecting the\nasteroidal material. However, there are challenges with this concept, most of which\nlie in the GN&C aspects and repetitive automated rendezvous and docking (AR&D)\nrequired by the concept. The collection spacecraft has to dock with the SEP tug in\norder to transfer the material, and the SEP tug has to be able to receive and store the\nmaterial in the micro-gravity environment. This requires that the two spacecraft must\nbe controlled precisely so that no collision occurs and the material is successfully\n15\n\ntransferred to the SEP tug. Rather than just storing the collected material, this concept\nalso introduces the possibility of processing asteroidal material to extract propellants,\nsuch as magnesium or sulfur, which could be used by the SEP tug during tractoring\noperations. This would be particularly valuable for larger asteroids that require several\nhundred tons of propellant to be delivered to the asteroid.\n\nFigure 15: Illustration of Separable Collection Spacecraft and SEP Tug.\n\nConcept 4 \xe2\x80\x93 Multiple Collection Spacecraft and SEP Tug\nThe fourth concept deploys multiple collection spacecraft to collect asteroidal material\nand deliver it to the SEP tug. These collection spacecraft are likely smaller than the\none envisioned in the second concept acquiring less mass during each collection\noperation. However, by having spacecraft scattered in a swarm fashion on the\nsurface, this concept can access multiple areas simultaneously and can be more\nefficient in accumulating masses than a single collection spacecraft. In addition,\nhaving multiple collection spacecraft provides redundancy to ensure success of the\nmission. This concept faces the same GN&C and AR&D challenges as with the single\ncollection spacecraft concept with the additional constraint of scheduling delivery of\nmaterial to the SEP tug by multiple spacecraft. This concept is illustrated in Figure 16.\nThere are multiple variations and ways of implementing and combining these three\nbasic concepts. Successful attempts to harvest asteroidal resources by NASA\xe2\x80\x99s ARM\nand commercial entities (e.g., Planetary Resources, Deep Space Industries, and\nKepler Energy and Space Engineering) will also have tremendous synergistic benefits\nfor the successful implementation of material capture for a the EGT technique.\nLearning the basic techniques for mining material from larger NEAs will help improve\nthe reliable operations needed to allow this approach to be successfully implemented\nfor a future planetary defense effort.\n\n16\n\nFigure 16: Illustration of Multiple Collection Spacecraft and SEP Tug.\n\nOther EGT Operational Concepts\nThis section briefly discusses several other EGT concepts of operations that are of\ninterest. These concepts assume that a SEP system is still the primary source of\nthrust that facilitates the deflection of the asteroid. When using a SEP tug for EGT, it\nis very important the SEP thruster plume not impinge on the asteroid. This requires\nthat the SEP engines are either canted [2] or the EGT is offset radially from the asteroid\nvelocity vector [5,9]. As discussed previously, canting the SEP engine reduces the\nefficiency and the effectiveness of the EGT due to thruster cosine losses, and thrusters\nthat minimize plume divergence greatly benefit all operational concepts. Offsetting the\nEGT using the spiral tractoring technique also introduces cosine losses of the\ngravitational pull in the along-track direction. The concepts discussed here aim to\nimprove upon the existing EGT concepts in the literature by alleviating some of the\naforementioned shortcomings, by utilizing solar sails and tethers. Detailed analyses\nof these concepts will be presented in a future publication [14].\nFigure 17 shows the concept of attaching a solar sail to the EGT spacecraft. The Solar\nRadiation Pressure (SRP) naturally pushes the EGT away from the sun, and thus,\noffsetting the EGT from the asteroid velocity vector. The solar sail can also be tilted\nso that a force component can be generated in the along-track direction to supplement\nthe tugging force. The position of the EGT relative to the asteroid is an equilibrium\nresulting from balancing three external forces, gravity, SEP thrust, and SRP. An\nappropriate equilibrium can be established by trading the combined spacecraft mass,\nthe size of the solar sail, as well as the solar sail tilt, given the thruster plume\ndivergence angle.\nUsing multiple EGTs in formation can drastically improve the efficiency of the asteroid\ndeflection. For example, Wie [5] showed that placing n spacecraft in a halo gravity\ntractor orbit is n times more efficient in deflecting an asteroid. However, this requires\ntight control of the spacecraft positions to prevent them from colliding with each other\nas well as the asteroid\xe2\x80\x99s surface. This issue can be mitigated if the spacecraft can be\nnaturally separated. Figure 18 illustrates such a concept, which is a view of a 3-EGT\nscenario from behind the asteroid in the along-track direction. It can be seen that each\nof the three EGTs is attached to a solar sail, and by tilting the solar sails about the\n17\n\nalong-track vector, the forces in the cross-track direction separate the spacecraft\nnaturally. These EGT spacecraft do not fly in a halo orbit in front of the asteroid.\nInstead, they are naturally held at their respective equilibria due to balance of external\nforces.\nThe effectiveness of the EGT operations is greatly dependent on the gravity\ncomponent in the along-track direction. Thus, it is preferable to keep the mass close\nto the asteroid. Figure 19 illustrates a concept that keeps the augmenting mass on a\ntether. The augmenting mass can be placed much closer to the asteroid to increase\nthe gravitational pull, to the limit of the SEP thrust capability, with much less mass\nwhile the SEP tug can be placed further from the asteroid for increased safety margin.\nSimilar to the approach shown in Figure 17, a solar sail is used to provide the radial\noffset, and it can be tilted to augment the tugging force. The dynamics associated with\nthe tether in the micro-gravity environment can be complicated, and need to be\ncarefully analyzed.\n\nFigure 17: Single EGT with a Solar Sail.\n\nFigure 18: Multiple EGTs on Solar Sails.\n\nFigure 20 shows a concept where the EGT is in-line with the asteroid velocity vector.\nThis concept requires the SEP engines to be canted to prevent the plume streams\nfrom impinging the asteroid surface. This reduces the effectiveness of the gravity\ntractor due to the cosine loss of the SEP thrust in the along-track direction. For\nexample, Lu [2] showed a concept where the effective thrust for tugging the gravity\ntractor is only half of the total available thrust due to canting the SEP engines 60\ndegrees from the along-track direction. The concept here aims to reduce the cosine\nloss. As shown in Figure 20, the augmenting mass is attached to a tether, and kept\nclose to the asteroid, while the SEP tug is kept farther away in the in-track direction.\nBecause of the increased distance from the asteroid to the SEP tug, the SEP engines\ndo not need to be canted as much as in the case where the SEP tug is closer to the\nasteroid, assuming the thruster plume angle remains the same. Clearly, this concept\nincreases the efficiency of the EGT operation. Here, the mass can be kept closer to\nthe asteroid than the scenario where the spacecraft and the augmenting mass are\ncollocated. Thus, the same effectiveness of EGT can be obtained with a smaller mass.\nThe challenge of this concept lies in the complicated dynamics associated with tethers\nin the micro-gravity environment. The complexity of station-keeping the mass and the\ninteraction between the mass and the SEP tug need to be carefully investigated.\n\n18\n\nFigure 19: Single offset EGT on a Solar\nSail with Tethered Mass.\n\nFigure 20: Single in-line EGT with\nTethered Mass.\n\nCollection Site Selection\nIt is postulated that most of the boulders and regolith on the surface of an asteroid may\nbe deposited by impacts from other small bodies [11]. For example, K\xc3\xbcppers [11]\nshows that the boulders on the surface of asteroid Lutetia are mostly concentrated\naround the central crater in Baetica region, as shown by the images taken by the\nOSIRIS camera onboard Rosetta. This is consistent with the simulated distribution of\nboulders ejected from that crater. It is also theorized in Thomas [15] that Shoemaker\ncrater is the source of most boulders on asteroid 433 Eros. Boulders can also be\ncreated by thermal stresses. A larger structure can be fractured by the larger\ntemperature gradients caused by crossing the terminator plane repeatedly [12]. If\nthese theories are correct, it is likely that most boulders should be loosely resting on\nthe surface, with the forces keeping them on the surface being only the low gravity\nand cohesion.\nSelection of boulder sites depends on many factors, which include lighting,\ncommunication links, asteroid rotation, etc. Here we touch upon the comparison of\nthe sites on various latitudes in facilitating the boulder extraction only. All asteroids\nrotate in some fashion, with some tumbling (e.g., Toutatis) and others rotating around\na single axis (e.g., Itokawa, 2008 EV5, and Bennu). For a tumbling asteroid, it is\ndifficult to characterize the pros and cons of going to various sites on the surface.\nHowever, for the principal-axis rotators, it is evident for the few well observed asteroids\nsuch as Itokawa and Eros, many of the boulders congregate in the equatorial regions\n[10,12]. This can be explained by the slow process in which the boulders shift to the\nequatorial regions due to the extremely small but persistent centripetal acceleration.\nThus, the abundance of boulders makes the equatorial regions more favorable than\nothers. In addition, the centripetal acceleration is the strongest at the equatorial\nregions, which can facilitate picking up boulders. For example, Figure 21 shows a\ncomparison of the gravitational and centripetal accelerations at various latitudes on a\nfictitious spherical asteroid with a 250 m radius and a density of 2 g/cm3. The boulder\nis 20 metric tons, and the spacecraft is 9.7 metric tons (wet mass) at 20 m above the\nsurface when capturing the boulder. It can be seen that if the asteroid rotates more\nrapidly than approximately once every 2.4 hours, in the equatorial regions, once the\n19\n\ncohesion is broken, the spacecraft can fly away with the boulder naturally without the\nneed for external forces due to the centripetal acceleration being greater than the\ngravitational acceleration (green and red curves). The benefit of the centripetal\nacceleration diminishes as the collection site moves up in latitude. If boulder to surface\ncohesion is low, which can be expected for a boulder resting on the surface, there are\nlikely regions on the surface where collection operations could be greatly simplified.\n\nFigure 21: Comparison of Gravitational and Centripetal Accelerations.\n\nOperational Challenges of Mass Augmentation\nOne significant operational challenge of the EGT method involves collecting the\naugmentation mass at the NEO. However, analysis that has been performed for the\nARM robotic concept to date [6,7] and the commercial interest in asteroid mining\nindicates that collecting many tons of mass from the surface of an asteroid is feasible\nand further analysis and concept development is warranted. The concept of\noperations currently being considered would provide the first demonstration of mass\ncollection of the magnitude needed to successfully conduct an EGT deflection. Other\ncollection techniques such as electromagnets, large quantity regolith collection,\nmultiple boulder collection systems, and others have been envisioned and require\nfurther study and development.\nThe ARM robotic segment concept assumes that capture operations occur while the\ncollection site is illuminated by the sun due to the reliance on optical navigation\nsensors and the desire to keep the ARV from experiencing an eclipse due to power,\nthermal, and potential charging issues. This constraint combined with the reliance on\n20\n\noptical navigation during descent and the desire to maintain a passively safe trajectory\nas long as possible, sets a spin rate limit for accessible asteroids at a little over 3 hours\n[6]. However, if a mission were solely focused on planetary defense, different designs\ncould easily be envisioned that would remove or limit the reliance on optical navigation\nand/or allow the spacecraft to operate through an eclipse period that would relax this\nspin rate limit.\nFinally, another concern about the spin rate is the existence of collectable material at\nthe target. On small, fast rotators, the centripetal acceleration can exceed the surface\ngravitational forces leading to shedding of surface material and forming a monolithic\nbody without any available material to collect. As shown in Figure 22, very few large\nasteroids have been observed to be spinning at a rate above the rubble pile \xe2\x80\x9cspeed\nlimit\xe2\x80\x9d rotation period of approximately 2.3 hours [16]. A low cohesive strength of only\n25 Pa can explain this observation. This leads to the conclusion that the vast majority\nof the large asteroids have the capability to retain surface material, and that material\nis likely to be loosely bound to the parent asteroid and readily collectable, thus making\nEGT a credible deflection technique for hazardous-sized impactors.\n\nFigure 22: Asteroid Size vs. Rotation Period Distribution\n(Image Credit: Paul S\xc3\xa1nchez and Dan Scheeres \xe2\x80\x93 Ref. [16]).\n\nApplicability to Hypothetical Threat \xe2\x80\x9c 2015 PDC\xe2\x80\x9d\nWe analyzed the ability of a 50-kW spacecraft like the ARV to deflect the 4th IAA\nPlanetary Defense Conference hypothetical asteroid \xe2\x80\x9c2015 PDC\xe2\x80\x9d using the enhanced\ngravity tractor technique. There are two major challenges in this scenario for a gravity\ntractor. First, assuming that launch or departure from the Earth-Moon system is not\n21\n\npossible earlier than spring 2017 (about a year after final observations are made), the\nimpact date of September 2022 defined in this scenario leaves only 5.5 years to reach\nthe asteroid and impart enough impulse to deflect it. This would be challenging for\nany slow-push/pull approach. Second, the asteroid orbit aphelion of 2.65 AU limits the\navailable sunlight during parts of the diversion to only about 15% of the 1 AU insolation.\nThis severely limits the power available for any technique that utilizes the solar power.\nNevertheless, we found that there are some plausible solutions in which an ARV-class\nEGT can deflect the hypothetical asteroid 2015 PDC in the available time.\nThe only physical characteristic of the asteroid known at time of launch is the absolute\nmagnitude, H = 21.3 \xc2\xb10.4 (assumed to be one-sigma uncertainties). Depending on\nthe albedo and density of the asteroid, this could correspond to a spherical-equivalent\ndiameter from less than 100 m to more than 500 m, and a mass from less than 1 million\ntons to more than 100 million tons. The asteroid is more likely to be in the lower third\nof this range unless it has both a very dark albedo and the error in H makes it brighter\nthan nominally predicted. As a test case we defined an asteroid with H = 21.7 (i.e.\n+1 ), albedo = 0.3, and density of 2.5 g/cm3 corresponding to a stony asteroid with a\nmass of 1.7 million tons. This is smaller and less massive than the most likely values,\nbut within a reasonable range. The spherical equivalent diameter would be 110 m, but\nwe assumed a 2:1:1 ellipsoid of the same volume as the predicted sphere, with\ndimensions of ~87 x 87 x 175 m. This non-spherical assumption is important because\nit influences how close to the asteroid the spacecraft can be, and the gravitational\nforce is proportional to the square of the separation distance. We applied a constraint\nthat the spacecraft should remain at least 100 m beyond the maximum dimension of\nthe asteroid to avoid collision, corresponding to a minimum spacecraft-to-asteroid\nradius of 187 m when not thrusting, and radius when thrusting of about 200 m using\nthe halo orbit approach defined in [9] and described earlier in this paper. Dense\nasteroids can be easier to move than larger low-density asteroids of the same mass,\nand spherical asteroids are easier to move than elliptical ones, because the gravity\ntractor can orbit closer to the center of mass and generate more gravitational force.\nThe force that can be applied to the asteroid is potentially limited by two factors. First\nis the available thrust from the spacecraft, based on the available power and the\ncapacity of the propulsion system. Second is the gravitational attraction between the\nasteroid and the spacecraft plus collected augmentation mass. In most cases we\ninvestigated, gravitational attraction was the limiting factor, so it is more effective to\ncollect as much mass as possible from the asteroid, up to an assumed limit of 1000\nmetric tons. It should be noted that this mass is greater than the current ARM robotic\nboulder capture system design requirement, so a modified capture capability would be\nnecessary. This produced a net tractor force of approximately 1.0 N using the\nfollowing equation from [9]:\n\xed\x90\xba \xed\x91\x8e\xed\x91\xa1 \xed\x91\xa0\n\xed\x91\x80 \xed\x91\xa0\xed\x91\x9a \xed\x91\x90\n\xed\x90\xb9 \xcf\x81\n\xed\x91\xa7\n\xed\x91\x81\n\xed\x9c\x8c \xed\x91\xa7\nFN \xe2\x80\x93 Thrust required to remain in the halo, also the thrust that the spacecraft applies\nto the asteroid-ARV system.\nG \xe2\x80\x93 Gravitational constant\nMast \xe2\x80\x93 Mass of the asteroid\n22\n\nmsc \xe2\x80\x93 Mass of the spacecraft with any mass augmentation\n\xcf\x81 \xe2\x80\x93 Radius of the halo orbit from the trajectory centerline\nz \xe2\x80\x93 Offset distance of the halo orbit from the center of mass of the asteroid\nIt is assumed that the ARV spacecraft departs the Earth-Moon system with a\ncharacteristic energy (C3) of 2.0 km2/s2. This can be achieved by a spacecraft orbiting\nin high Earth orbit using a lunar flyby, or by a direct launch from Earth to escape on\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s planned heavy-lift launch vehicle known as the Space Launch System (SLS).\nThe transit to the asteroid, shown in Figure 23 in green, takes 1,000 days and has a\nsingle 40 day coast period (shown in purple), though 10% power margin and a duty\ncycle of 95% allow for additional thruster off periods. Upon arriving at the asteroid on\nMarch 12, 2020, a three month long period of reconnaissance and mass collection is\nallocated before beginning the EGT operations. By thrusting for the next 824 days,\nthe ARV is capable of deflecting the asteroid from the subterranean 2,790 km Earth\nperiapsis radius (i.e., an impact) to 6,930 km allowing for a miss of 560 km altitude\nfrom the surface. In Figure 24, the trajectory of the ARV while thrusting with the\nasteroid is shown in green and the trajectory of 2015 PDC after deflection and\nsubsequent Earth close approach is shown in purple. Given the very narrow miss\ndistance margin, this scenario defines the limit of what this 50 kW-class vehicle can\naccomplish with the warning time and impactor orbit provided in the scenario and\nhighlights the fact that more warning time and better remote characterization of\nimpactors are highly desirable, particularly for slow-push/pull techniques.\nCoasting w/ 30d Ticks\nThrusting w/ 30d Ticks\nSun\nEarth\nVenus\nMars\nAsteroid\n\n2.5\n\n2\nAphelion:\n1.9357 AU\n\n1.5\n\nY (AU)\n\n1\n\n0.5\n\n0\n\n-0.5\n\nPerihelion:\n0.80367 AU\n\nLaunch: 4/1/2017\nC3 = 2.00 km2/sec2\n\n-1\n\nArrival: 3/12/2020\n\n-1.5\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\nX (AU)\n\nFigure 23: ARV Trajectory to Asteroid 2015 PDC (green/purple); Asteroid 2015 PDC\ninitial Orbit (black); Earth Orbit (blue).\n\n23\n\nPre-Flyby w/ 30d Ticks\nPost-Flyby\nSun\nEarth\nVenus\nMars\n\nAphelion:\n2.6487 AU\n\n2.5\n\n2\n\n1.5\n\nY (AU)\n\n1\n\n0.5\n\nThrust Start:\n6/1/2020\n\n0\nPerihelion:\n0.64561 AU\n-0.5\n\nFlyby: 9/3/2022\nAlt: 560 km\n-1\n\n-1.5\n-3\n\n-2.5\n\n-2\n\n-1.5\n\n-1\n\n-0.5\nX (AU)\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\nFigure 24: ARV Deflection of Asteroid 2015 PDC Thrusting Arc (green);\nTrajectory of 2015 PDC after Deflection and Subsequent Earth\nClose Approach (purple); Earth Orbit (blue).\n\nAs mentioned, the variables that affect the deflection are the time allowed to deflect\nand the maximum thrust that can be applied. The SEP system aboard the ARV is\ncapable of 1.63 N of thrust and could be augmented with additional thrusters to\nupgrade the system, which would allow for a potentially shortened thrusting duration\nto reach the asteroid. Additionally, either larger arrays or new cell technology could\ntake the maximum power at one AU to a higher level than the assumed 50 kW\ncapability. More array power would allow the thrusters to operate at the maximum\nallowed halo thrust when farther from the Sun and would also allow for a shortened\nthrusting duration to the asteroid. Either of these vehicle modifications coupled with\nearlier detection would allow the ARV to be applicable to larger NEAs.\nWarning Time and Compatibility with other Planetary Defense Options\nAs shown previously, a significant advantage of the EGT is that it can drastically\nreduce the deflection time compared with the standard gravity tractor. Although\nsufficient warning time is needed as is the case with all slow-push/pull techniques,\nEGT is a viable option when the warning time is measured in years, and not decades\nas is needed for the standard gravity tractor approach utilizing only the mass of the\nspacecraft. Figure 25 shows the approximate regimes of primary applicability of the\nfour types of planetary defense techniques: civil defense, kinetic impactor, the\n24\n\ntraditional gravity tractor, and a nuclear explosive device. The EGT technique can\nsignificantly overlap the regime of the kinetic impactor, especially if a SEP spacecraft\nlike the ARV has been developed and operated or if it has actually been launched and\ncan be expediently refueled in space.\n\nFigure 25: Approximate Regimes of Primary Applicability of four Types of Planetary\nDefense Techniques (Image Credit: Tim Warchocki \xe2\x80\x93 Ref. [17]).\n\nThe pros and cons and the typical mission scenarios and constraints of classic\ntechniques for planetary defense such as nuclear blast, kinetic impactor and gravity\ntractor have been well documented in literature, while the EGT is quite a new concept.\nIt is also a very flexible tool in the hands of policymakers when they have to choose\nthe reaction strategy. The simplest mission scenario for the EGT is that it is chosen\nas the primary reaction strategy as soon as the asteroid threat is discovered and\nsufficiently characterized: the spacecraft is launched, it collects mass from the\nasteroid, and performs the EGT deflection.\nHowever, the EGT is also very much complementary to the kinetic impact and nuclear\nexplosion techniques. Indeed, assuming that policymakers decide to implement a\nkinetic impact approach or opt to deliver a nuclear explosive device, if the primary\nmission does not perform with full success and is not completely successful in\ndeflecting the impactor or leaves smaller parts of the original asteroid still with a risk\nof impacting the Earth, the EGT can provide trajectory corrections to the impactor or\ncan collect mass from the smaller asteroid fragments and perform the EGT technique\non them.\nAdditionally, in principle the EGT spacecraft can also provide in one single mission\n(one single spacecraft) the nuclear option. The spacecraft could also carry a nuclear\nexplosive device and deploy it after collecting mass from the asteroid for subsequent\n25\n\ntractoring. Depending on the warning time and the characteristics of the impactor,\npolicymakers will have to decide if the nuclear explosion option should be performed\nright away, or if the EGT can be performed first. If the nuclear explosion is taken as\nthe first mitigation technique, the EGT can maneuver to safe distance while the\nexplosion takes place, and then come back to check if the primary option worked\nproperly, and perform corrections through the EGT technique on the main body and/or\nany smaller fragments that might still have a risk of impacting with the Earth.\nIt is likely that in the future there will be multiple ARV buses ready to launch and\nalready operational in space, for example to deliver logistics supplies to astronauts in\ncislunar orbit, where the first ARV has placed the redirected asteroidal material, or to\ndeliver cargo to the Mars neighborhood. Since the EGT technique builds on the ARV\nbus, the fact that there could be multiple ARV-derived buses available would make the\nEGT a ready to launch option. So ready that it might already be in space and simply\nbe repurposed for its critical new mission of planetary defense. Finally, with the ability\nto be refueled, the ARV itself could be used as a kinetic impactor augmented by the\nmass collected during normal asteroid mining and processing operations.\nSummary\nThe Enhanced Gravity Tractor technique is a novel, innovative variant of the traditional\ngravity tractor that can significantly reduce the deflection time required to be an\neffective planetary defense approach. Using mass collected in-situ, which would likely\nrange from tens to hundreds of metric tons depending on the size of the impactor and\nwarning time available, allows for significant augmentation of the tractoring mass and\ngreatly increases the gravitational force between the objects.\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s ARM robotic segment will provide the first ever demonstration of the EGT\ntechnique and validate collecting a multi-ton boulder in-situ. For an actual mission to\ndeflect an Earth impactor, the collected material could be a single boulder, multiple\nboulders, regolith or a combination of different sources. There are many ideas for\nmass collection techniques and operational augmentations that can increase the\neffectiveness and reduce the operational risks associated with the EGT technique, and\nseveral have been highlighted in this paper. Depending on the impactor\xe2\x80\x99s\ncharacteristics, the propulsion system\xe2\x80\x99s capability and the mass collected, the EGT\napproach can reduce the deflection times by more than two orders of magnitude.\nAlthough the EGT still requires a significant warning time to reduce the required \xe2\x88\x86V\nfor the deflection, the ability to alter the trajectory more rapidly allows the EGT\ntechnique to be applicable to a greater range of impact threats. The ability for multiple\nspacecraft to orbit the impactor in formation can increase the \xe2\x88\x86V than can be applied\nand further reduce the time needed by the EGT technique to divert hazardous NEOs.\nFinally, the spacecraft necessary to successfully conduct an EGT deflection can also\nsupport other planetary defense techniques in a coordinated manner to maximize the\nsuccessful deflection of a future Earth impactor. Advancements in SEP propulsion,\nautonomous vehicles, and robotic systems applicable to human and robotic\nexploration, commercial asteroid mining, and the used of space-based resources can\nsynergistically help provide a robust defense against future Earth impacts.\n\n26\n\nReferences\n[1]\n\nMazanek, D.
