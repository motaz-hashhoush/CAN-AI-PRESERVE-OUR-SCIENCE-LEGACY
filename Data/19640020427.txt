Esther\nf\nwas discovered when a ship in the Atlantic had\nreported high winds, and the U.S.Weather Bureau\nasked NASA if Tiros could take pictures of the area.\nWithin 3 hours of the request from Miami, Tiros\npictures of the hurricane were in the hands of the\nmeteorologists.\nMany other cloud phenomena have been observed\nby Tiros. Jet stream clouds and mountain clouds are\nshown in fig. 10, a photograph of the Red Sea area.\nIn figure 11, the diamond-shaped cloud, which was\nabout 50 miles square, was associated in time with\nsevere thunderstorm and tornado activity as the surface\nanalysis on the right shows.\n\n138\n\nPEACEFUL USES O F SPACE\n\nFIGURE\n6.-Tiros I11 observations in a data-space area.\n\nI\n\nFIGURE\n7.-A\n\nWEATHER SATELLITES\n\n139\n\nphotograph of Florida showing severe squall line and thunderstorm activity west of Tampa.\n\n140\n\nPEACEFUL USES OF SPACE\n\nFIGURE\n8.-Hurricane\n\nAnna in 1961, of the Venezuelan coast.\nf\n\n~~\n\nI\n\n\\\n\nFIGURE\n9.-A\n\nWEATHER SATELLITES\n\ndetailed cloud analysis made on September 11, 1961.\n\n141\n\n142\n\nPEACEFUL USES OF SPACE\n\nFIGURE\n10.-Jet\n\nstream and mountain clouds on April 4, 1960.\n\nFIGURE1 .-Cloud\n1\n\npatterns associated with a tornado.\n\nWEATHER\n\nSATELLITES\n\nIce reconnaissance has been another accomplishment\nof the Tiros series.\nThis was particularly\ntree of\nTiros II which carried a narrow-angle\ncamera, in addition to the standard, to achieve 0.2-mile resolution.\nThe high resolution mosaics of Tiros II photographs\nin figure 12 show Anticosti Island in the Gulf of St.\nLawrence and the ice conditions on 2 days, March 23\nand 29, 1961.\nThe movement\nof the ice and its\nfreeing\n\nof the\n\nisland\n\nduring\n\nthis\n\n6-day period\n\nare\n\nquite apparent.\nThis reconnaissance has been of considerable interest to the Canadian Government\nand to\nthe shipping\ncompanies using the gulf.\nNormally,\nextensive aircraft overflights are used for such reconnaissance.\nRadiation\n\nData from Tiros\n\nThe year 1963 saw the establishment\nfive-channel\nradiometric measurements\n\nJ/\n\nof the Tiros\nas tools of\n\ngreatest potential for the exploration\nof the Earth\'s\natmosphere for meteorological\npurposes.\nThis instrument, which\nmeasures the emitted\nand reflected\nelectromagnetic\n\nradiation\n\nfrom\n\nthe\n\nEarth\n\nand\n\nthe\n\natmosphere,\nmaps the spatial\ndistribution\nof the\nenergy by using the spin of the satellite to generate\nthe scan line and the motion of the satellite along its\norbit to advance the scan line.

In contrast,\nlow-radiation intensities are observed over cloudy areas\nwhere radiation is emitted by the relatively cold-cloud\nsurfaces. Radiation minima indicating high clouds exist at high southern latitudes where a number of typical\nwinter storms are in progress; over the North Pacific\nwhere a series of frontal systems range from Japan to\nthe Gulf of Alaska; and over the tropics, north of the\nequator.\nA major tropical storm, Flossie, is located\nover the Philippines.\nThe 48 \xc2\xb0 inclination of the orbit limits the possible\ndata coverage to a broad zone between about 55 o N.\nand 550 S.

Such phenomena as the\nAleutian high and the weak summer polar vortex of\nthe southern hemisphere are readily identified.\nTroposphere relative humidities over the United States\nwere measured by the 6.3-micron water vapor channel\nof the Tiros radiometer (fig. 16). This is a new type\nof observation, which, frankly, we do not yet know\nhow to use in the routine weather forecasting work.\nOne final Tiros accomplishment of the past year has\nbeen the exercising of the Automatic Picture Transmission (APT) system developed for Nimbus. The\nobjective was to provide a means of transmitting\ncloud pictures of daylight areas of the Earth directly\nto the user of the data, whether he be on land, at sea,\nor in the air. Further, it was a requirement that the\nground equipment be inexpensive so that the interna-\n\ntional community could make extensive use of the\nsystem.\nIn operation, the satellite-borne vidicon camera\nsystem takes a picture and over the following 200\nseconds transmits it directly without external command. All APT ground stations, which consist of an\ninexpensive antenna and receiver and a relatively\nexpensive facsimile machine, capable of tracking the\nsatellite during the 200 seconds, can receive the\npicture. Thus, the local user receives a doud picture of the area surrounding him (about 1,000 miles\nsquare). Figure 17 is a photograph of one type of\nground station antenna being used for AFT reception.\nFigure 18 shows an APT ground station, completely\nready for use, consisting of only two low racks.\nFigure 19 is an example of an APT photograph from\nTiros V 1 showing the west coast of the United\nI1\n\nWEATHER SATELLITES\n\n147\n\n148\n\nPEACEFUL USES OF SPACE\n\nI\n\nf\nI\n\n4\n\n149\n\nWEATHER SATELLITES\n\nStates. This picture was received by the AFT station\nat Pacific Missile Range, Calif.\nA specific example of the usefulness of APT in a\n"prognostic" sense was a photograph* obtained on\norbit 1150, M r h 9, 1964, at 17:58:212. This\nac\nphotograph was instrumental in developing a FAWS\nforecast (F\'I-2), on the basis of discussion of the\nimplication of the field with the FAWS forecaster\nwhich was at considerable variance with the previous\nFT-2. The FT-2\'s issued at 17002 on the 9th and\n23082 on the 9th were compared.\nSpecifically, the 17002 FT-2 of the 9th was prepared prior to the acquisition of the photograph and\nindicated a cold front passage at JFK International\nAirport with considerable thunderstorm activity and\ngenerally improving conditions after 15002 on the\nloth. This was based on a surface analysis which\n*Unfortunately no copy is available for inclusion in this\npaper.\n\ncarried a warm front to the west of J X and a cold\nJ\nfront farther to the west.

In other words, JFK\nwould have gotten into the warm sector.\nThe photograph indicated that the main front was\nan east-west affair located well south of JFK and that\nwhat was being carried as a cold front to the west was\nreally, in effect, an occlusion undergoing frontolysis.\nThere was no well-defined system of cloud to indicate\na front to the west, but rather a uniform cloud mass\nwith no apparent light or dark areas. The absence of\nlight areas implied the absence of cumulo-nimbus activity in the area to the west. Discussion with the\nFAWS forecaster then resulted in a reanalysis of the\nfrontal structure and a consequent change in the FT-2.\nThe FT-2 issued at 23082 on the 9th deleted the\nFROPA and thunderstorm activity (that was in the\nprevious FT-2) and improved the weather immedi-\n\nately, for a time, and deteriorated it again after 07002\non the loth, more or less a reversal of the previous\nFT-2. This revision worked out quite well. It is not\nmeant to imply that the forecast might not have\nevolved in the same fashion when all the conventional\ndata were examined for the period prior to 23002.\nHowever, the photograph was available, and discussion\nof iits implication was made at about 19002. This\nstarted the revision in thinking, and a study of subsequent conventional data did bear out the interpretation\nresulting in the new FT-2. In other words, the photograph was definitely an input which, when combined\nwith later conventional data, produced good results.\nT h e Present Program\nIn the next 18 months to 2 years, we are planning\nto do two things:\n\nWEATHER SATELLITES\n\n(a) Complete the qualification of the secondgeneration meteorological spacecraft system,\nNimbus, and launch the spacecraft.\n(b) Adapt and convert the Tiros and Nimbus technology to an operational system capable of\nmeeting the national weather service\xe2\x80\x99s minimum operational requirements.\nNASA is undertaking both these tasks with every\nexpectation of success.\nNimbus\nThe Tiros system has served the Nation well, but\neven before Tiros I was launched on April 1, 1960,\nwe recognized that it was a device of limited capabilities that would ultimately be replaced. Bolstered by\nour early success with Tiros we took a \xe2\x80\x9cgiant step\xe2\x80\x9d\nforward. W e replaced the spinning 300-pound spacecraft, Tiros, with only 20 watts of power and carrying\nonly 70 pounds of sensors, by the 800-pound earthoriented Nimbus, with 200 watts of power and capable\nof carrying at least 250 pounds of sensors and of\nstaying in a polar orbit. Figure 20 is an artist\xe2\x80\x99s\ndrawing of the Nimbus spacecraft in flight. The\ndevelopmental step between Tiros and Nimbus is well\nillustrated by the artist\xe2\x80\x99s sketch of the two systems in\nfigure 21. The Tiros spacecraft photographs about\none-seventh of the Earth every day with a resolution\n\n151\n\nof about 3 miles. Nimbus will take a picture of\nevery one-half square mile of the Earth once a day.\nThe Nimbus spacecraft will also carry infrared\nequipment for high-resolution measurements of the\nnighttime clouds, a feat not possible with present\nT V systems. An APT system using the existing\nground complex of stations will be in operation.\nFollow-on flights will see the inclusion of advanced\nfive-channel radiometers like the Tiros unit, tor\nmapping clouds and cloud heights, water-vapor distribution, stratospheric temperatures and so on.\nInterferometers, high-resolution spectrometers, passive\nmicrowave equipment, and other atmospheric sensors\nwill be tried.\nNimbus is absolutely essential to the national\nweather satellite program for one fundamental reason.\nThe meteorologist in forecasting the weather-and the\nultimate use of the meteorological satellite is as an\noperational tool supporting the weather services-uses\nthe wind and pressure fields as his principal data\ninputs. Today, the satellite cannot measure these\nparameters either directly or indirectly. However, the\nmeteorological satellite can and does make physically\nsignificant measurements; and we in the atmospheric\nsciences must learn the language the satellite speaks.\nNimbus has the power, stability, and other properties\nrequired for this learning process.\nT h e Tiros Operational System\nAt the request of the national weather services and\nwith the funding of the Department of CommerceU.S. Weather Bureau, NASA has undertaken the task\nof converting the Tiros technology-developed with\nNASA funds-to an operational system capable of\nmeeting the minimum operational requirements.\nBriefly stated, these requirements are for cloud photographs of the entire Earth at least once each day. The\nglobal coverage is to be delivered by the satellite to\na central processing facility; in addition, local readout\nof the pictures (APT) is required.\n\nFIGURE20.-The\n\nNimbus spacecraft.\n\n/\n\nThe ordinary spin-stabilized Tiros cannot provide\nglobal coverage efficiently. One of NASA\xe2\x80\x99s biggest\ncontractors in the meteorological satellite area has devised a scheme which will solve the global coverage\nproblem, and, in addition, provide more readily handled picture data. Figure 2 2 illustrates how a Tiros\nsatellite, still spin-stabilized but now turned so that the\nspin axis is always perpendicular to the plane of the orbit, can provide global coverage. The camera, whether\n\n\xe2\x80\x981\n\n152\n\nPEACEFUL USES OF SPACE\n\n~\n\nFIGURE .-Meteorological\n21\n\n~~\n\nsatellite development: Tiros and Nimbus.\n\na conventional vidicon or the APT system, looks outward from the side of the spacecraft. The shutter of\nthe camera is triggered by the horizons of the Earth so\nthat the picture is taken when the camera points\nstraight downward.\n\nFIGURE\n22.-A\nsketch illustrating how a Tiros satellite can provide global coverage.\n\nThe next Tiros launched, Tiros I, will be in\nthis cartwheel configuration. This R&D unit (which\nhas been funded by NASA) will prove the concept\nand the hardware and make possible the minimum\noperational system we are calling the Tiros operational\nsystem (TOS). It is planned now to prepare two\nbasic cartwheel spacecraft: one will contain two APT\ncameras of the type developed for Nimbus for local\nreadout and the other will contain two of the advanced vidicon cameras also developed for Nimbus.\nThe spacecraft are identical except for the cameras.\nThe use of two cameras in each spacecraft is indicative\nof the redundancy being used in the Tiros system.\nIt is an improvement over the previous Tiros systems\n\n~\n\nWEATHER SATELLITES\n\nin the degree of \xe2\x80\x9ccross-strapping\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99 of subsystems.\nThus, the failure of one of the two tape recorders\nwill not destroy the satellite usefulness, because the\nbackup unit can be used with either vidicon or either\ntransmitter. The same is true of other major subsystems of th&;pacecraft.\nTo be economically feasible, an operating system\nmust have a predictable, reasonably long life.\nObviously, the longer the life, the lower the annual\noperating costs of the system. The facts, that (1) the\nTiros hardware has proved its life capabilities (Tiros\nVI lasted 13 months and Tiros VI1 will be 1 year old\nin June) and that (2) better use is being made of\nredundancy, give us confidence that an economically\nacceptable system can be brought into being.\n\nT H E FUTURE\nWe cannot produce a crystal ball at this point, but\n\n~~\n\nFIGURE\n23.-\n\n153\n\nthere are some important questions to be answered,\nsome problems to be golved, and some hardware to\nbe developed before the national and world weather\nservices can make the most effective and economical\nuse of this new aerospace tool. Figure 23 is an\nillustration of the lifetimes of typical weather systems,\none of the most serious problems. This problem\nis characteristic of any measurement made on the\nweather system; only the clouds are illustrated here.\nA periodic measurement is being made of a power\nspectrum, or, more simply put, if the storm lasts only\n3 hours, and Nimbus or Tiros makes a measurement\nevery 24 hours, it is obvious that the satellite might\nnot even see the storm. One solution, and probably\nthe most effective, will be to place a satellite at\nsynchronous altitudes. Then the sensor system can\nlook down on the same area of the Earth and keep it\nunder constant observation.\n\n~\n\nifetimes of typical weather systems.\n\n154\n\nPEACEFUL\n\nAside from the more fundamental\nq_estions already\nmentioned (that of learning to*"speak the language"),\nwe are faced with the task of making nighttime cloud\ncover measurements,\nof measuring\nthe pressure and\nwind fields, of developing\nreliable, predictable-life\nsystems, and of finding techniques for handling\n100\nto 500 million bits of data in real time--to\nmention\njust a few.\n\nUSES\n\nOF\n\nSPACE\n\nCONCLUSION\nIn the meteorological\n\nsatellite\n\narea, the nation\n\nembarked on a program that promises\nbenefit and service to all mankind.\n\nhas\n\nto be of great\nIt will save\n\nlives and property and, in time, make the lives of\neach of us just a little bit fuller and more enjoyable.\nIt may be that the meteorological\nsatellite program\nis the best example of the peaceful use of space.\n\n'
