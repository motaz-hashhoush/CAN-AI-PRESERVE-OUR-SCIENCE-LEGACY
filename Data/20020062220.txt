b'L\n\naunching satellites is not just for NASA any more.\nToday\xe2\x80\x99s commercial satellite industry is shooting for\nnew frontiers beyond space exploration. The fast\ngrowing information and communications service markets are\ncontinually increasing efforts to make our everyday lives\neasier, by searching for more efficient methods of providing\ncustomers with quality service. Realizing the tremendous need\nfor a multi-mission design, AeroAstro, of Herndon, Virginia,\nwith assistance from NASA Marshall Space Flight Center,\ndeveloped a nanospacecraft core module capable of developing recyclable spacecraft designs using standard interfaces.\nFrom this core module, known as the Bitsy\xe2\x84\xa2 kernel, custom\nspacecraft are able to connect mission-specific instruments\nand subsystems for variation in mission usage. Typically, all\nspacecraft require the same basic subsystems: power and\npower distribution, command and data handling, communications, and guidance. Although the general composition is\nthe same, it has been the industry standard to develop\nspacecraft as unique designs, for specific missions, resulting in\n$50 to $100 million designs that were expensive and difficult\nto reuse. A generic design would greatly improve space\nmissions, but this concept has not been readily accepted into\nthe satellite industry due to the tremendously high costs of\ndiffering mission details, large size and mass, and the need to\nmaintain two parallel development teams: the payload and\nthe spacecraft.\nThe Bitsy kernel is designed to meet three key criteria.\nFirst, the kernel must be reliable. To achieve maximum\nreliability, Bitsy incorporates straightforward design, thorough\ntesting, and standard interfaces and components. The next\nkey element is cost; the kernel must be inexpensive. The\nversatility of the kernel keeps costs down by using a reproducible model capable of serving multiple missions. Finally, the\nkernel must be easy to use, which is achieved through Bitsy\xe2\x80\x99s\nflexible and extensive capabilities that are applicable to a\nvariety of missions. Bitsy is small, lightweight, and is able to\noperate in any orbit, making it very appealing to the commercial market. Advanced technology such as Lithium-Ion\nbatteries and dense field programmable gate array electronics\nmake the unit efficient. When equipped with vaporizing\nliquid thrusters and structural propellant tanks the unit is\neasily maneuvered.\nThe nanospacecraft core module may be used in conjunction with an existing microsatellite bus or customized to meet\nspecific requirements. Building on this premise, AeroAstro has\n\nCOMMERCIAL BENEFITS\xe2\x80\x94SPINOFFS\n\nBitsy Thinks Big\ndeveloped a line of satellite communications equipment, sun\nsensors, and Lithium-Ion batteries which are all incorporated\nin its complete line of mission-specific nanospacecraft. The\nBitsy technology is also a key component in AeroAstro\xe2\x80\x99s\nsatellite inspection products and orbital transfer services. In\nthe future, AeroAstro plans to market an even less expensive\nversion of the Bitsy technology. The plan, which is targeted to\nuniversities, markets a sort of \xe2\x80\x9csatellite in a kit,\xe2\x80\x9d for less than\n$1 million. This technology would allow universities to build\ntrue space hardware for a fraction of the cost of launching a\nregular satellite. Available alone as the core module component, or as a complete spacecraft based on the Bitsy system,\nthe Bitsy kernel offers commercial customers limitless designs\nto meet the needs of specific missions. \xe2\x9d\x96\nBitsy\xe2\x84\xa2 is a trademark of AeroAstro.\n\nThe Bitsy\xe2\x84\xa2 nanospacecraft core module component\noffers commercial customers limitless designs to meet\nthe needs of specific missions.\n\nNASA SPINOFF \xe2\x9e\xa4 2001\n\nCOMPUTER TECHNOLOGY\n\n97\n\n'
