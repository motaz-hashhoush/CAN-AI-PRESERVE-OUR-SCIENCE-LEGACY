With this method, it is possible to\ndetect leaks in, and determine the leak rate of, modules\nwhich are sealed while fully evacuated, partially evacuated, or containing some form of gas. It has proven\neffective for nondestructive leak testing of relatively\nsmall sealed modules, ranging in structure from semiflexible to semirigid.\n\nThe illustration shows a typical test setup. A module\nis placed in the fixture. The dial indicator is zeroed\nwhile its probe is in contact with a centrally located\npoint on the most flexible surface of the module. A bell\njar is placed over the fixture and partially or completely\nevacuated by the vacuum pump. Complete evacuation\nwill create an inside-to-outside module pressure differential equal to the pressure of the atmosphere within the\nmodule. This, in turn, will cause even a slightly flexible\nsurface area to act as a diaphragm and produce a\ndeflection of the gauge dial. No gauge deflection\nindicates a gross leak, initial gauge deflection that falls\nback toward zero indicates a fine leak, and gauge\n\nBell Jar\nSensitive Dial\nIndicator\n\nModule\nUnder Test\n\nNondestructive Leak-Test System\n(continued overleaf)\nThis document was prepared under the Sponsorship of the National \t\nAeronautics and Space Administration.

In such a\ncase, the gas can be replaced by closing the valve to\nthe vacuum pump and flooding the bell jar with the\nsame gas through a separate supply inlet. This will\nprovide an opportunity to repair the module under\noriginal conditions.\nThe test setup shown is effective for gauge deflections\nof 0.00127 cm (0.0005 in.) or greater. For very small\nor more rigid modules, the apparatus is modified by\nremoving the dial indicator and replacing it with a\nsensitive strain gauge connected to a digital readout.\nThis modified apparatus can then be calibrated to detect\nsmaller diaphragm movements.\n\nNote:\nNo additional documentation is available.
