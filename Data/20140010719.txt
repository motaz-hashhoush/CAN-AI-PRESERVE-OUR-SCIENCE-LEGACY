b'Green Solvents for Precision Cleaning\nHeather Grandelli, Phillip Maloney, Robert DeVor, Jan Surma\nand Paul Hintze\nNASA Kennedy Space Center, FL, USA\n\nIntroduction\nAerospace machinery used in liquid oxygen (LOX) fuel\nsystems must be precision cleaned to achieve a very low\nlevel of non\xcd\xb2volatile residue\n(< 1 mg/0.1 m2) to prevent\nexplosive oxidation of contaminants. Currently Vertrel\xcd\xb2MCA,\na blend of decafluoropentane and trans\xcd\xb2dichloroethylene, is\nused in the precision cleaning process at the Kennedy Space\nCenter. Fluorinated compounds are persistent in the\nenvironment and according to the manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s MSDS,\nVertel\xcd\xb2MCA can decompose to hydrofluoric and hydrochloric\nacids at high temperatures. This has now led to the\ndevelopment of new processes in the precision cleaning of\naerospace components.\n\nFigure 1. Helix system components. Only the center two components\nwere used in the preliminary work which employed a stirred\xcd\xb2batch\nprocess.\n\nApproach\nHighlighted is a cleaning process which employs\nsupercritical CO2 to dissolve and remove the Table 1. Parameters and levels tested.\ncontaminant from metal parts.\nA fluorinated\nParameter\naerospace grease, Krytox 240AC, was investigated as a\no\nLevel Time, min Temperature, C Pressure, psi Impeller Speed, rpm\nmodel fluorinated contaminant and aluminum\n1\n5\n35\n1200\n0\ncoupons were used as model aerospace components\n2\n30\n50\n2000\n500\nin preliminary investigations. A stirred\xcd\xb2batch process\n3\n45\n100\n4000\n750\n[Fig. 1] was employed in which the effects of cleaning\n4\n60\n150\n6000\n1000\ntemperature, pressure, exposure time and stir rate\nwere examined and optimized using the Taguchi\nmethod [Table 1].\n\nResults\nThe Taguchi method results showed that the parameter effecting the cleaning efficiency the greatest is pressure, followed by\ntemperature, exposure time and then impeller speed. The results were further analyzed using the Pearson product moment\ncorrelation, which showed that lower temperatures, higher pressures and shorter exposure times all resulted in improved\ncontaminant removal. This is illustrated in the contour plots in Figure 2. Figure 3 shows the dependence of the cleaning efficiency on\nthe CO2 density, which was acquired from the P / T information.\n\n% Removed\n\nFigure 2.

Cleaning efficiency as a\nfunction of CO2 density (n=3).\n\nConclusions\nTemperature and pressure were found to have the most significant impact on the cleaning efficiency. This preliminary work has\nprovided a foundation for ongoing studies of cleaning using supercritical CO2. Ongoing studies focus on the use of the CO2 recycling\nmodule, in line detection of contaminant concentration and the use of co\xcd\xb2solvent to further improve cleaning efficiency, if needed.\n\n'
