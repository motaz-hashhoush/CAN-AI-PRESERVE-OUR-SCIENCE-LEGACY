In response to a Request for Information from\nthe US National Research Council panel on Science Opportunities Enabled by NASA's\nConstellation System, we developed a concept for astronaut-based in-space servicing at the\nEarth-Moon L1,2 locations that may be implemented by using elements of NASA\xe2\x80\x99s\nConstellation architecture. This libration point jobsite could be of great value for major\nheliospheric and astronomy missions operating at Earth-Sun Lagrange points. We explored\nfive alternative servicing options that plausibly would be available within about a decade. We\nhighlight one that we believe is both the least costly and most efficiently uses Constellation\nhardware that appears to be available by mid-next decade: the Ares I launch vehicle,\nOrion/Crew Exploration Vehicle, Centaur vehicle, and an airlock/servicing node developed for\nlunar surface operations. Our concept may be considered similar to the Apollo 8 mission: a\nvaluable exercise before descent by astronauts to the lunar surface.\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt is dumb to launch complicated, expensive telescopes into space that cannot be serviced.\xe2\x80\x9d\n-- Michael Griffin, NASA Administrator (11 February 2008)\n\n2\n\nIn our opinion, it is short-sighted to\ndevelop very ambitious \xe2\x80\x93 and very\nexpensive \xe2\x80\x93 science missions based in\nfree space and not have the ability to\nupgrade, repair, or re-provision them, if\nthat ability can be achieved in a costeffective way. Moreover, we believe that\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s Constellation architecture offers\nsuch potential capabilities in addition to\nits primary goals of ferrying humans to\nthe ISS and, eventually, returning\nhumans to the lunar surface.\n\n1. The Case for In-Space Servicing Meets\nNew Opportunities\nInfrastructure currently planned to return\nhumans to the lunar surface can achieve\nadditional major goals in free space that\nare, at present, not otherwise possible.\nThis infrastructure can deliver humans to\nlocations where their unsurpassed\nabilities would be available to upgrade,\nrepair, augment, or maintain important\nand expensive space assets. Although\nfuture space robotics are being assessed\nin this context, it is unlikely on the\ntimescale of the next few decades that\nrobots will surpass humans in their ability\nto carry out such critical tasks in space.\nThus, it is desirable to examine in some\ndepth how NASA\xe2\x80\x99s new Constellation\nProgram hardware, which represents the\nnext generation space transportation\narchitecture for the United States, might\nbe used to provide this in-space servicing\ncapability in the relatively near future.\n\nIn April, 2008 the panel on Science\nOpportunities Enabled by NASA's\nConstellation System of the National\nResearch Council (NRC) released a\nRequest for Information (RFI) on\nconcepts for using the Constellation\narchitecture to enable major science\ngoals. This paper summarizes our team\xe2\x80\x99s\nresponse to that RFI: a concept to enable\nsuch goals through in-space servicing,\nbeginning as soon as about the middle of\nthe next decade. The ability to service\nspacecraft will increase science value and\nlower mission risk for an entire class of\nambitious missions. Moreover, given the\nrapid advance of technology, especially\nin\ndetectors,\ncomputing,\nand\ncommunication\nsystems,\nin-space\nservicing will result in orders of\nmagnitude increase in scientific return\nfrom an existing facility, as has been\ndemonstrated regularly for almost two\ndecades with the Hubble Space Telescope\n(HST). HST is a proven, hugely\nsuccessful program in which astronaut\nservicing has been invaluable. It is a\nmodel for the future that we consider\nhere. At the same time, it is essential that\nan in-depth and objective assessment of\nthe costs of in-space servicing relative to\nthe scientific gains be carried out.\n\nIn the following sections, we explore the\nrole that servicing by astronauts could\nplay in lowering risk and increasing\nscience results for especially ambitious\nfuture space science missions. In all\ncases, these missions are large, complex,\nvery capable, and very expensive. We\nhave used a major space astronomy\nmission concept as a notional placeholder\nfor our assessment. This is appropriate\nbecause, in many respects, our concept is\ncomparable to that for ground-based\ntelescopes and HST, which produced\nmajor astronomical results well beyond\nthat permitted by their original\ninstrument complement. Furthermore, the\nvast majority of high-priority space\nastronomy goals are better achieved in\nfree space than on the lunar surface\n(Lester, Yorke, and Mather 2004).\n3\n\noperations that will be necessary well in\nadvance of human expeditions beyond\nthe Earth-Moon system.\n\nWe examine five concepts that use\nelements of the NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Constellation\narchitecture as currently understood for\nastronaut-based servicing at what we\nconsider to be exceptionally valuable\nvenues within cis-lunar space. Our\nconcepts Our goal was to identify the\nastronaut-based servicing strategy that\nwill have the lowest cost, requires\ndevelopment of the smallest number of\nelements\nof\nthe\nConstellation\narchitecture, and is most likely to be\navailable soon after deployment of the\nAres I and Orion crew transport systems.\n\nAdditional concepts and early design\nwork on adapting the Constellation\narchitecture may be found in Stevens and\nKing (2005), Moe et al. (2005), Lester,\nFriedman, and Lillie (2005), Lester,\nBudinoff, and Lillie (2007) and\nreferences therein. Farquhar et al. (2003)\ndiscussed in detail options for servicing\nmajor observatories at libration points,\nalthough\nproposed\ndeveloping\nspaceflight hardware in addition to that\nwhich is planned by the Constellation\nProgram.\n\nWe consider in particular that part of the\nConstellation architecture that would be\ndeployed around the middle of the next\ndecade. We assess the viability of several\noptions for travel to a priority location in\ncis-lunar space and remain there for up to\nabout two weeks of operations using a\nminimum number of Constellation\nelements. For several reasons, which will\nbe described below, we consider the\nEarth-Moon L1,2 locations to be the most\nattractive site for broadly useful\nservicing. 1 After our downselect, we\nsummarize other advantages of our\npreferred concept, in addition to\nrelatively near-term availability: (1)\nbuilding upon extensive HST and ISS\nexperience with in-space operations; (2)\nproviding opportunities for international\ncontributions; (3) continuing with the\ntype of experience with in-space\n\n2. An Historical Note\nThe concepts that we consider here\nfollow the long tradition of science\ncommunities using hardware and\ninfrastructure that was intended originally\nexclusively for human spaceflight (cf.,\nThronson et al. 2007). In the mid-1960\xe2\x80\x99s,\nthe Apollo Applications Program\nconsidered a number of adaptations of the\nApollo crew and service modules\nintended to achieve significant Earth,\nsolar, and astronomical science goals\ntaking advantage of astronauts on site\n(e.g. Cohen 1967). Some of these designs\nwere subsequently adapted for the Skylab\nprogram. Again, in the early 1970\xe2\x80\x99s, the\nscience\nand\nhuman\nspaceflight\ncommunities worked together on early\ndesigns of the Space Shuttle that\nsignificantly broadened its value to\nmultiple communities, with demonstrated\nearly success in rescuing, upgrading, and\nrepairing a number of satellites that were\nnot originally intended to be serviced.\n\n1\n\nA note on designations: as discussed in\nSection 3 and in many published papers,\nthe two semi-stable Earth-Moon libration\npoints, L1 and L2, in opposite sides of the\nMoon along the Earth-Moon line, are\nextremely attractive sites for in-space\noperations. There are some differences in\nthe dynamics and accessibility of the two\nlocations. However, these differences are\nnot critical for most of our discussion, so\nin this paper we will usually designate\nthem jointly as Earth-Moon (E-M) L1,2.\n\nThere is not at present an applications\nprogram for the Constellation program\nsimilar to that which led to the science\nproductivity of Shuttle-based servicing of\nHST or science missions on Skylab. Such\n4\n\nmission an upgrade path that would\ninclude new instruments, with new\ntechnologies, thus providing an order of\nmagnitude or more of added capability.\nSuch a servicing option also offers\nenhanced mission success.\n\nan applications program could play a\nsignificant role in achieving the full\nscience potential of NASA\xe2\x80\x99s future space\ntransportation system.\nWe note that about a decade ago, thenNASA Administrator Daniel Goldin\nchartered the Decadal Planning Team\n(DPT), which was followed by the\nNASA Exploration Team (NExT). Over\nthree years, in advance of the Exploration\nArchitecture Systems Study (ESAS),\nthese teams investigated in depth the\noptions,\nalternatives,\ntechnology\ninvestments, costs, and impact on science\nand human spaceflight for an architecture\nbased on a series of \xe2\x80\x9cstepping stone\xe2\x80\x9d\njobsites, such as the libration points that\nwe evaluated. This paper attempts to put\nsome of those decade-old trade studies\ninto the context of the new Constellation\narchitecture. An extensive discussion of\nthe DPT and NExT efforts is in\npreparation by NASA\xe2\x80\x99s History Office\n(Asner and Garber 2009, in preparation).\n\nMajor astronomy goals for the ~2020\ntimeframe are derived from NASA\nstrategic\nplans\nand\nreasonable\nextrapolation of community (e.g.\nNational\nAcademy\nof\nSciences\nAstronomy Decadal Survey) input. These\ninclude study of Earth-like extrasolar\nplanets, the detailed mechanisms with\nwhich stars are formed, characterization\nof the formation of the first galaxies out\nof primordial clouds, and exploration of\nthe physics of compact regions such as\nblack holes and galactic nuclei. Each of\nthese goals requires large structures,\nwhether for large light-collecting\napertures providing greater sensitivity (as\nfor SAFIR), or interferometric truss\nstructures, both of which offer high\nspatial resolution. Such telescopes will\ninevitably be very costly, and their long\nterm science value will be, as for HST\nand\nground-based\ntelescopes,\ndramatically enhanced by the opportunity\nfor eventual instrument upgrade and\nsubsystem replacement. The technologies\nfor both focal plane sensor format size\nand sensitivity are on a steep\ndevelopment trajectory. This is just as for\nlarge ground-based observatories in\nwhich the major investment is in the\ntelescope itself, which retains most of its\nscientific value after obsolescence of the\nfocal plane instrumentation As we will\ndescribe below, we can predict this\nobsolescence of the focal plane\ninstrumentation with some confidence.\n\n3. Scientific Goals Enabled by this\nCapability\nWe emphasize how an ambitious future\nprogram of NASA human spaceflight,\ndirected toward a human return to the\nMoon, can enable major science goals.\nAs has been repeatedly demonstrated\nwith the Hubble Space Telescope, using\nhuman spaceflight infrastructure has\nmade that facility arguably the single\nmost important science tool ever\ndeveloped, although at a significant cost.\nIn developing our case, we will refer to\nthe Single Aperture Far Infrared Mission\n(SAFIR), which, in many respects, can be\nused here as a strawman example of a\nlarge, high-value astronomy mission\nclass (Lester et al. 2008). As for all\ncurrent mission concepts, SAFIR is\nbaselined as being unserviced. However,\nthe servicing option that the Constellation\narchitecture could provide offers such a\n\nIn addition to science upgrades, in-space\noperations will extend the useful lifetime\nof an observatory by providing for\nmaintenance of subsystems that are\nunderstood to have finite lifetime, such as\n5\n\nstation-keeping propellants (which will\nbe needed at libration points, as well as\nfor orientation and pointing systems),\nsolar panels, and power storage systems.\nSuch operations would also allow\nmission-critical upgrades for obsolescent\nspacecraft subsystems, such as computer\nand communication systems. While\nastronaut servicing has its own inherent\nrisks, the availability of servicing\ndramatically lowers risk of single-point\nfailure in the observatory, which would\nend its life prematurely. Finally,\nimplementing design features that make\nin-space servicing possible may reduce\noverall mission costs, even if servicing is\nnever carried out: integration & test in the\nfinal stages of mission development is\nalmost certainly far easier for modular\nsystems and sub-systems.\n\nFIGURE 1: The Earth-Moon L1,2 locations may be\nthe most valuable jobsite in cis-lunar space to\nachieve major science goals. Shown here are\napproximate high-thrust \xce\x94Vs needed for\nmovement among different locations in cis-lunar\nspace. Travel between the preferred astronomy\noperations site at Earth-Sun L1,2 and Earth-Moon\nL1,2 jobsite reachable by using Constellation\nsystems requires orders of magnitude less energy\nthan that required to reach those locations\ndirectly from, for example, LEO.\n6\n\nA common characteristic of astronomical\n\xe2\x80\x9cflagship\xe2\x80\x9d missions, is operation at SunEarth L2. This location, roughly four\ntimes the lunar distance in the antisunward direction, has enormous value\nfor space astronomy owing to the low\ntorques, readily manageable thermal\nenvironment, large available field of\nregard,\nuninterrupted\nline\nof\ncommunication to Earth and continuous\nsolar power. The majority of future\nastronomy missions are, for these\nreasons, destined for this location. At this\ndistance, visits by astronauts can be\nconsidered problematic, mainly because\nof weeks-long transit times, which\nincreases\nradiation\nhazards\nand\nunexpected failure of major onboard\nsystems. That is, it is difficult to justify\nlong human voyages in space that are not\nabsolutely necessary. Consequently, for\nthe foreseeable future, visits beyond the\nMoon may not be easily achieved within\nNASA plans for returning humans to the\nlunar surface.\nThe possibility of servicing observatories\nby returning them to low Earth orbit\n(LEO) appears of little value, as it\nrequires propulsive loads too large for the\nlightweight support structures of space\ntelescopes, as well as exposing precision\nmirror coatings and materials to\ncontaminants and debris from this\nincreasingly polluted location. Therefore,\nservicing by humans or robots ideally\nrequires a jobsite well beyond LEO, but\nnot far beyond the Moon. This seems to\nus to be an obvious and natural role for\nConstellation system capabilities.\nOf paramount importance in this context\nis the low-energy pathway between SunEarth L1,2 and the more accessible EarthMoon L1,2 (see Figure 1). These latter\nlocations are roughly 16% of the EarthMoon distance on either side of the Moon\non the Earth-Moon line. This pathway\nbetween the Sun-Earth and Earth-Moon\n\nlibration points connects, at remarkably\nlow propulsive cost, (1) the best\nastronomical observing site in cis-lunar\nspace to (2) what may be, with the\ndevelopment of the Constellation\narchitecture, a jobsite that is easily within\nthe transportation capabilities of nearterm elements of NASA\xe2\x80\x99s future human\nspaceflight architecture. We thus consider\na servicing operation plan whereby the\nscience facility makes a low delta-V (and\nsomewhat leisurely) return from the\nEarth-Sun L1,2 observing site to an EarthMoon Lagrange point jobsite, where it is\nmet by the astronauts and their servicing\nsystem.\nBefore we assess individual concepts, we\nnote special engineering challenges that\nwill need to be addressed with regard to\nsuch servicing efforts. For precision\noptical systems, a key challenge will be\nthe fragility of the observatory, and the\nsensitivity of the performance to\ncontamination, perhaps by propellants,\nwaste dumps, or outgassing of a freshly\nlaunched Orion stack. In the case of an\nobservatory that uses passive-cooling\nshields intensively, such as the SingleAperture\nFar-Infrared\n(SAFIR)\nobservatory, special care will be\nnecessary\nto\nprevent\nfreeze-out\ncontamination, even at the Earth-Moon\nL1,2, and damage to the observatory that\ncould compromise performance. We\nbelieve these challenges can be\nmitigated by appropriate mission design\nand operations.\nServicing opportunities for large, highvalue astronomical facilities provide far\nmore than just mitigation of system risk.\nAs we have learned with HST, a longlived facility must have instrumentation\nthat is responsive to new science\nquestions and to the development of new\ntechnology. In astronomy, focal plane\nsensors are developing rapidly in both\nformat size and per-pixel performance.\n\nThe trajectory for that development is\nespecially steep at infrared/sub-mm\nwavelengths. Very simply, the format\nsize of astronomical detectors follows\nMoore\xe2\x80\x99s Law, such that every 10 years\nthe number of pixels available to be put\nin the focal plane, and hence the amount\nof astronomical information available per\nunit observing time increases by a factor\nof 100 for a telescope that can be\nupgraded. This is shown in Figure 2 for\nvisual, near-, mid-, and far-infrared\ndetectors. This increase can be multiplied\nfurther by per-pixel performance\nincreases, which in many parts of the\nspectrum are now far from theoretical\nlimits. At least for UV and IR (such as\nSAFIR) missions, broadband imaging\ncan be confusion limited, so that the pixel\ncount is, in fact, a measure of target\ninformation obtained.\nThe impact of Moore\xe2\x80\x99s Law to\nastronomical science is multiplied, for\nexample in the case of SAFIR\xe2\x80\x99s farinfrared detector needs, by the rapid\nimprovement of per-pixel sensitivities.\nWhile technology roadmaps to achieve\ntheoretical limits for far-infrared detector\n\nFIGURE 2: The remarkable growth in number of\ndetector pixels demonstrates the value of servicing\nand focal place instrument replacement for those\nspace astronomy missions that can be upgraded.\nFocal plane array size is a clear metric for\n7\ntechnological advance that enhances science\nproductivity in all astronomy missions.\n\nsensitivity are available, we are presently\none or two orders of magnitude away\nfrom\nachieving\nthis\nultimate\nperformance.\nThe HST servicing\nprogram achieved its striking scientific\nsuccess while optical focal plane\ndetectors were at precisely this phase of\ndevelopmental evolution. Servicing and\ninstrument replacement has been a\nhallmark of ground-based astronomy, in\nwhich\ntechnology\nupgrade\nis\nstraightforward, and the large lightgathering\npower\nand\npointing\nperformance of even old telescopes can\nbe continually improved, dramatically\nbuilding on an original investment.\n\n4. Five Basic Constellation AstronautBased Servicing Concepts\nHere we describe five concepts that we\nassessed in response to the NRC RFI in\nApril 2008 and identify the one that we\nbelieve makes use of the minimum \xe2\x80\x93\nwhich also may be the least costly \xe2\x80\x93\nConstellation architecture elements and\nwhich will also be available within about\nthe next 10 years. As described in the\nprevious section, we evaluate these under\nthe requirement that the mission concept\nallows can reach the important EarthMoon L1,2 venue and to support astronaut\nextravehicular activity (EVA) at that\nlocation for at least two weeks. This\nwould\nallow\nHST-like\nservicing\nscenarios.\n\nFollowing the guidelines in the RFI, we\nlimited our assessments to only elements\nof the Constellation architecture and\nsimple derivatives. We consider both new\nhardware (Ares I, Ares V) and the\nCentaur upper stage (see data in\nIsakowitz 2004). This candidate upper\nstage\nis\nincluded\nin\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s\n\xe2\x80\x9cConstellation Overview\xe2\x80\x9d provided to the\nNRC as an integral component in the\nsuite of propulsion options\nin the\nConstellation spaceflight architecture.\nThe essential system characteristic at this\nstage of assessment is use of a minimum\nnumber of early-development elements of\nthe Constellation architecture that\nachieves sufficient velocity for departure\nfrom LEO to the Earth-Moon L1,2. That\nis, about 3 km s-1 to reach the location,\nabout 0.5 km s-1 for insertion into orbit,\nand an additional approximately 0.5 km\ns-1 propulsion requirement for station\nkeeping, and return to Earth. Thus, we\nadopt 4.3 km s-1 from LEO as an\napproximate minimum requirement for a\nservicing mission to an Earth-Moon L1,2\norbit.\nMore\nsophisticated\norbital\ncalculations show that LEO departure\nvelocities as low as 4.0 km s-1 may be\npossible in optimal situations (see\nbelow). Therefore, the first step in our\nassessment of different Constellationbased concepts was the simple\nrequirement that the \xe2\x80\x9cstack\xe2\x80\x9d traveling to\nEarth-Moon L1,2 was capable of a LEOdeparture total velocity of a minimum 4\n\nTABLE 1: Baseline Concept Parameters\nOptions\nConfiguration\n\nA\nB\nSingle\nDual Ares I\nAres I\n(2x SM)\nGemini-like Gemini-like\n\nC1\nC2\nD\nDual Ares I Dual Ares I\nAres V\n(Centaur)\n(Centaur)\n(EDS)\nGemini-like\nVia airlock Via airlock\n\nHuman\nServicing\nAres-I Flights\n1\n2\n2\n2\nAres-V Flights\n0\n0\n0\n0\nPropulsion\nSM\nSM + SM\nCentaur III+ Centaur III\nStaging to E-M\nSM\n+ SM\nL1,2 and return\nTotal Delta V\n1.5 km s-1* 2.4 km s-1*8 > 4 km s-1\n>4 km s-1\n* configuration does not achieve minimal required Delta V of 4 km s-1\n\n0\n1\nEDS + SM\n>>4 km s-1\n\nwhich assumes an Orion\non a single Ares V\nvehicle, easily has the\nnecessary\npropulsive\npower, but has other\ndisadvantages within the\ncontext of the goals of\nour study. The options\nother than C will be\nbriefly discussed below.\nIn both variants of option\nC, the first launch carries\nan Orion with a crew of\ntwo. (We made the rough\nFIGURE 3: Our preferred concept that permits in-space servicing throughout estimate that the mass\nthe Earth-Moon system within about a decade. Basic parameters are listed in saving by a reduction in\nTable 1 as Option C2 and in Table 2. This figure shows the stack after Earth crew was offset by the\norbit rendezvous of the Orion (from one Ares I launch) with the Centaur and necessity of including a\nservicing node (from the second Ares I launch). The Centaur is ejected before pair of Shuttle-derived\nEVA suits.) The second\nrendezvous with the observatory at EM L1,2.\nvehicle carries a Centaur\nIII. In one variant (C2,\nkm s-1 to be considered further\nsee Figure 3), the Ares I/Centaur launch\nincludes a servicing node derived from\nCalculated\nparameters,\nincluding\nthe Altair lunar lander, which contains an\nvelocities out of LEO, for the five options\nairlock.

The\n(two Ares I launches, with two standard\nConstellation\nprogram\ncurrently\nservice modules providing propulsion out\nestimates a 45-day turn-around for Ares I\nof LEO) do not provide the necessary\nlaunches, which would necessitate, for\nminimum propulsion to reach L1,2, as\nexample, loitering of Orion at the\nindicated in red in the table. Option D,\nInternational Space Station (ISS) until the\n9\n\nOrion (and not the Altair lander) to the\nlunar vicinity. Although the current\nversion of the Centaur is not humanrated, we note that such a similar transfer\nstage was baselined (Centaur-G) for the\nshuttle payload bay and its RL-10 engine\nhas been identified as the descent engine\nfor the human-carrying Altair lunar\nlander (data for the Centaur from\nIsakowitz 2004).\nWe consider it desirable, although not\nessential, for an airlock to be available\nfor in-space astronaut servicing beyond\nLEO. Orion alone (our C1 variant) offers\nonly limited EVA capabilities, rather\nsimilar to the Gemini spacecraft, which\ndecompressed the entire spacecraft such\nthat all occupants had to don bulky\nspacesuits. Moreover, the current design\nfor the Orion Crew Module (CM) permits\nonly three decompression/recompression\ncycles. Furthermore, the astronauts are\npresently limited to operating beyond\ntheir Orion spacecraft by a ~ 5 \xe2\x80\x93 6 m\numbilical. Finally, in our baseline C2\nmission, the Altair-derived airlock itself\noffers additional operational volume,\nstorage, and consumables.\n\nFIGURE 4: Concept variant C2 docked to the SAFIR\nobservatory and grasping the optical system and\ninstrument module in preparation for astronaut EVA\nand/or robotic servicing.\nsecond launch of the Centaur may be\npossible, though an ISS orbit would\nrequire additional propulsion compared\nto a more equatorial LEO orbit. Neither\nthis, nor loitering of the Centaur after\nlaunching first for that period (which\nwould boil off a large fraction of its\navailable cryogenic propellant) seems\ndesirable, however. A viable alternative,\naccording to the Ares V project office, is\nto launch the second Ares I more\npromptly from the pad being built for\nAres V, which is intended to have such\ncapability for Ares I as contingency backup.\n\nHowever, the airlock has considerable\nmass, which otherwise might be available\ninstead for additional payload in the C1\nvariant. We estimated the airlock mass\nbased on that being designed for the\nAltair ascent stage, which has a\ncalculated mass at this time of about\n1000 kg. We consider it likely that it will\nbe available well before humans return to\nthe lunar surface. This airlock is the key\ncomponent of the \xe2\x80\x9cservicing node\xe2\x80\x9d,\nshown in Figure 3. Based on a simple\nengineering model, we have estimated\nthe total airlock module to be 1700 kg.\n\nWe first discuss variant C2, which\nincludes an attached airlock. After Earthorbit rendezvous, the Centaur serves as\nthe transfer stage and provides the first\n2.6 km s-1 of the 3.3 km s-1 necessary for\ntransfer to Earth-Moon L1,2, with the\nOrion service module (SM) providing the\nremainder, including orbital insertion,\nafter Centaur staging. The Centaur thus\nserves the purpose of the Earth Departure\nStage (EDS) on the Ares V, although\navailable sooner and with a capability\nthat is adequate for transporting only the\n10\n\nTable 2: Adopted Masses of Elements\nof the Stack Shown in Figure 3.\nOrion\nCM Gross\nSM Gross\nSM Propellant\n\n19700\n7900\n11800\n8200\n\nkg\nkg\nkg\nkg\n\nCentaur\nStage Propellant\n\n22700\n20800\n\nkg\nkg\n\nServicing Node\nAirlock Module\nRobot Arm\nMission Payload\nPayload\nAccommodations\nNode\nAdapter/Grapple\nEVA Equipment\nTOTAL\n\n2700+\n1700\n1000\n<1000\n<400\n\nkg\nkg\nkg\nkg\nkg\n\n<200\n\nkg\n\n<500\n47200\n\nkg\nkg\n\nTable 2 summarizes the masses adopted\nor calculated for variant C2.

The\nfacility to be serviced, in this case an astronomical observatory, returns via lowenergy (i.e.,\xce\x94 V) transfer from Earth-Sun L2 to the Earth-Moon L1 or L2 location,\nwhere it is met by the Orion coupled to the Servicing Node module, the latter which\nfeatures an airlock. This human transport system can remain on site for 2 weeks.\nUpon completion of the servicing mission, the Orion Crew Module returns to Earth\nand the Servicing Node may remain at one of the libration points for servicing use\nat later dates. If intended for reuse, the 11\nServicing Node would be equipped with a\nsufficient communication and navigation systems, as well as nominal stationkeeping\npropulsion capabilities.\n\nmore than a basic Ares I and Orion\nsystems.\n\nAccommodations\n(e.g.,\ninstrument\nmounts and brackets, storage boxes); (3)\nNode Grapple/Adapter for the robotic\narm; and (4) EVA Equipment (e.g.,\ntools). We included first-approximation\nupper limits to these elements in Table 2.\nHowever, these are merely notional and\nmust be part of further design work. At\nthis stage of analysis, we are satisfied by\nestimating that the Servicing Node in the\n\xe2\x80\x9cstack\xe2\x80\x9d in Figure 3 has a total lower mass\nlimit of about 2700 kg, plus whatever\nadditional mass is necessary if useful\nwork is to be done at the jobsite. As\nTable 2 shows, if the Servicing Node is\ninstead not part of the mission (i.e.,\nvariant C1), a significant additional total\npayload mass becomes available.\n\nB. Two Basic Concepts with Insufficient\nPropulsion [Options A & B in Table 1]\nOur assessments were strongly motivated\nto seek the minimum Constellation-based\narchitecture capable of carrying two\nastronauts to the Earth-Moon libration\norbit target location. We began by\ninvestigating a pair of superficially\nattractive concepts: a single Ares I/Orion\nlaunch directly to Earth-Moon L1,2 with a\nCM lightweighted to carry a crew of two\nand using the SM as the sole propulsion\nsystem. option A in Table 1 was found to\nsupply insufficient propulsion by a large\nfactor.\n\nWith a concept and two variants that\nappear to achieve the minimum\nrequirements adopted for this study, the\nnext step in our analysis was a much\nmore detailed orbital analysis in which\nwe treated the Servicing Node mass as a\nfree parameter (next section). That is, we\nhave good estimates for the mass of\nevery other element in Figure 3. With the\npropulsion known for the Centaur III and\nOrion Service Module (SM), we can then\ncalculate the total payload mass \xe2\x80\x93\nincluding the Servicing Node for C2 \xe2\x80\x93\nthat can be carried via different routes to\nlocations.\nthe\nEarth-Moon\nL1,2\nObviously, our estimate for this mass\n(above; Table 2) requires that this\ncalculated mass be greater than about\n2700 kg for a viable option C2.\n\nWe next investigated a pair of Ares\nI/Orion launches (option B), which would\ndock nose-to-nose in LEO and the pair of\nSMs would supply the propulsion. We\ninvestigated this particular option, as a\nsecond Orion CM would offer significant\nadditional working volume, available\nconsumables, and could serve as an\nairlock for EVAs. A crew of two was in\nthe first launch and the second launch\ncarried no astronauts, but even with\nplausible lightweighting of the second\nCM, the pair of SMs provided\ninsufficient propulsion to reach the target\nlocation. Indeed, even without the second\nOrion CM \xe2\x80\x93 that is, no additional mass\nattached to the second SM \xe2\x80\x93 the pair of\nSMs were not capable of reaching the\ntarget location with the lightweighted\nCM.\n\nThis available additional payload mass\navailable for other purposes in option C1\nmay be desirable for some missions. We\nregard this no-airlock option as possible,\nbut not optimal for more complex inspace servicing missions. It might,\nhowever, be suitable for the most nearterm astronaut missions out of LEO since\nit would not presume development of any\n\nC. Ares V: A Single-Launch Servicing\nStrategy for Cis-Lunar Space [option D\nin Table 1]\nNASA plans to develop the Ares V\nheavy-lift vehicle over the coming decade\nto support a return to the lunar surface by\n~2020. Current requirements for this\n12\n\nvehicle are specifically not to preclude\nhuman rating, and it is our understanding\nthat such human rating of Ares V is\nconsidered a useful long-range goal by\nNASA. The Earth Departure Stage (EDS)\nand solid rocket boosters (SRBs) will\nalready be human-rated, and, as with the\nCentaur, the EDS uses an RL-10 which,\nas noted above, is already baselined for\nthe astronaut-carrying Altair lunar\ndescent module. In view of this, we\nconsidered the option to use Ares V to\nlaunch an Orion with an airlock, atop a\nConstellation EDS, which is also\n\nintended to be deployed late next decade.\nAres V is so powerful that it would easily\nmeet the basic goals that we have\nestablished for our study: human EVA\noperations\nat\nEarth-Moon\nL1,2.\nFurthermore, this arrangement meets our\nneeds in a single launch. Indeed, our\nanalysis shows that there is very large\navailable payload mass, which could be\nused to carry, for example, additional\nfacilities, infrastructure, science missions,\nand so on. However, we did not identify\nthis option as a preferred concept, as (1)\n\nTABLE 4\nCalculated Total Velocities and Payload/Servicing Node Masses for Concepts C1 and C2:\nInsertion into Earth-Moon L1 and L2\nDV (m/s)\n\nDV (m/s)\nDirect\nInjection\nLarge L2\n\nDV (m/s)\nDirect\nInjection\nSmall L2\n\nDV (m/s)\n\nDV (m/s)\n\nDirect Injection\nLarge L1\n\nDV (m/s)\nDirect\nInjection\nSmall L1\n\nLunar assist\nLarge L1\n\nLunar assist\nLarge L2\n\n3200\n(-2.2)\n440\n\n3100\n(-2.3)\n620\n\n3200\n(-1.6)\n880\n\n3200\n(-1.6)\n1000\n\n3200\n(-1.6)\n200\n\n3200\n(-1.6)\n400\n\nDeterministic\n\n30\n\n30\n\n30\n\n30\n\n30\n\n30\n\nStationkeeping (per\nyear)\n\n60\n\n60\n\n60\n\n60\n\n60\n\n60\n\nLibration Departure\n\n430\n\n620\n\n750\n\n1000\n\n300\n\n500\n\nEarth Transfer trimming\n\n50\n\n50\n\n50\n\n50\n\n50\n\n50\n\nDV Tranfer+inj+depart\nTOTAL DV\n\n4070\n4210\n\n4340\n4480\n\n4830\n4970\n\n5200\n5340\n\n3700\n3840\n\n4100\n4240\n\nPayload (C1) or\nServicing Node (C2)\n(kg)\n\n2800\n\n350\n\n(-2300)\n\n(-4500)\n\n5300\n\n2500\n\n12\n4.4\n\n11\n4.4\n\n14\n6.4\n\n14\n6.5\n\n14\n16\n\n12\n12\n\nTransfer Injection\n(C3)\nLibration Injection\n\nDurations (days):\nL1 or L2 Period\nTransfer\n\nGreen boxes identify lower DVs\nAssumptions:\nLEO departure at 28.5 deg and 185 km circular orbit\nLarge L1/L2 is y amp ~ 60,000 km\nSmall L1/L2 is y amp ~ 15,000 km\nEarth entry, no orbit\nLissajous Orbit / Lyaponav\n\n13\n\nThe calculated available payload mass\nmust be greater than about 2700 kg \xe2\x80\x93 the\nmass for the Servicing Node \xe2\x80\x93 for variant\nC2. We find that the available payload\nmass using direct injection into a large\nobit around E-M L1 is not much more\nthan the minimum mass that we estimate\nfor the Servicing Node alone (Column 1\nin Table 2). At the level of this\npreliminary analysis, we estimate that\nthis trajectory appears to permit only a\nServicing Node-based mission with\nlimited payload. However, the permitted\nServicing Node mass is large enough that\nwe consider it very worthwhile to pursue\nthis concept with more sophisticated\nanalysis, including the possibility of, for\nexample, a more powerful transfer stage\noption than a Centaur III.\n\nit is almost certain to be a less\neconomical approach, as the Ares V\nsystem is far more capable than we\nrequire to achieve the goals our study,\nand (2) it will not be the first available\namong the options that we considered\nand\ndepends\nupon\nsuccessful\ndevelopment of the full complement of\nConstellation infrastructure, specifically a\nhuman-rated Ares V and the EDS.\n5. Optimized Payload Masses to EarthMoon L1,2: More Sophisticated Orbital\nDynamics\nThe basic preferred concept (Figure 3,\noption C2) for astronaut-based servicing\nwithin about a decade at Earth-Moon L1,2\nappears promising within the limitations\nof our preliminary assessment (previous\nsection). In this section, we consider\ndifferent trajectories between LEO and\nthe two Earth-Moon libration points. In\nthe following analysis, we treat the mass\nof the Servicing Node as a free parameter\nand seek trajectories to the libration\npoints with the lowest required velocities,\nwhich would permit larger masses for the\nServicing Node \xe2\x80\x93 or, in its place,\nadditional payload (C1) \xe2\x80\x93 and associated\nequipment. As discussed for Table 2, we\nestimate a minimum mass for the\nServicing Node of about 2700 kg. Of\ncourse, we would like to find plausible\ntrajectories out of LEO \xe2\x80\x93 and return to\nEarth with the Orion crew module \xe2\x80\x93 that\npermits Servicing Node masses much\ngreater than 2700 kg for the more capable\nC2.\n\nOn the other hand, the detailed analysis\nshows that E-M L1 and L2 are not strictly\nequivalent. The velocities for direct\ninsertion into and return from the E-M L2\nlocation are so large as to preclude\nsignificant\nConstellation-based\noperations at this location. Indeed, the\ncalculated available payload/Servicing\nNode mass is negative, which means that\nthe Orion vehicle would have to be\nlightweighted far more than seems\nplausible at this time to even make such a\nmission possible, even without the\nServicing Node. Pending more detailed\nstudies, it would appear that neither of\nthe variants for concept C is viable for a\nEarth-Moon L2 destination.\nFinally, we examined the effect of using\nthe Moon\xe2\x80\x99s kinetic energy to reduce the\nvelocity required of the system in Figure\n3: a lunar swing-by and insertion into the\nlarge orbits around either the L1 or L2\nlocation. The results in our table show\nthat the additional velocity imparted to\nthe \xe2\x80\x9cstack\xe2\x80\x9d is sufficient to permit a very\nsignificant increase in the allowed\npayload/Servicing Node mass. Of course,\nthe penalty for swing-by orbits is an\n\nThe results of analyzing several\ntrajectories are shown in Table 4 for six\nbasic orbits. \xe2\x80\x9cLarge L\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cSmall L\xe2\x80\x9d\nrefer to the size of the orbit around either\nof the libration points, L1,2. Large orbits\nat these locations are well known to\nrequire less energy \xe2\x80\x93 a lower velocity \xe2\x80\x93\nfor injection into (and out of).\n14\n\nby astronauts, which has been proven\ninvaluable on HST, further work should\nevaluate the benefits \xe2\x80\x93 and an objective\nassessment of the costs \xe2\x80\x93 and recognize\nthat the Constellation architecture\nprovides a basis for such in-space\nactivities in a way never before possible.\nIn the longer term, such efforts could\npave the way one day to actual in-space\nconstruction of large science facilities,\ntranscending the size limits that will\noccur even with Ares V. Such a\ncapability would build upon extensive inspace experience developed for the ISS\nand as part of the HST servicing\nprogram.\n\nincreased transfer time from LEO to the\njobsite: about two weeks, rather than 3 \xe2\x80\x93\n4 days for direct injection. This may not\nbe insurmountable, given the significant\nincrease in calculated available mass,\nalthough all human spaceflight missions\ngenerally try to minimize the amount of\ntime spent in space.\nIn summary, we have identified a basic\nconcept to use a pair of Ares I launches, a\nCentaur transfer vehicle, and an Orion\nCrew Exploration Vehicle that would\nappear to be able to service, repair, and\nupgrade major scientific facilities at the\nEarth-Moon L1 location by around the\nmiddle of the next decade. Given that the\nAres I system \xe2\x80\x93 or its successors \xe2\x80\x93 are\nintended to be a key element in\ntransporting humans to the International\nSpace Station over the coming decade\nand to be part of the return of humans to\nthe lunar surface, it is reasonable to\nassume that Ares I will be available for\nmany years into the future.\n\nFollowing earlier pre-ESAS work by the\nDecade Planning and NASA Exploration\nTeams (Asner and Garber 2009, in\npreparation), we have presented a\nstrategy that highlights the special value\nof Earth-Moon Lagrange points as\nservicing jobsites. A more detailed\nevaluation is called for, which should\ninclude the potential value of such a\njobsite to a lunar surface exploration\nprogram. Finally, any future technology\nprogram should include enabling\ncapabilities important to our concepts:\nrobot systems, large optics systems,\ncomputing and IT, power generation and\nstorage, communication systems, and inspace human systems (e.g., EVA suits,\nlife support).\n\nWe emphasize the preliminary nature of\nour work, produced in response to a\nspecific Request for Information from the\nUS\nNational\nResearch\nCouncil.\nAdditional work on these topics, using\ndifferent\nassumptions\nwould\nbe\nrevealing.\n6. Recommendations\n\n7. References\n\nThe opportunities for large, expensive\nfuture science missions in cis-lunar\nspace, particularly those placed there\nusing the proposed Ares V heavy-lift\nlaunch vehicle, argue strongly for a\nstrategy to service these missions, with\nrobots and/or astronauts. Such a strategy\nmay reduce overall mission cost and risk,\nas well as increase lifetime and\nproductivity by making the alreadyexpensive science mission responsive to\nongoing technology developments.
