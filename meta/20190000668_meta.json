The first version of Seeker is intended to be an incremental development towards an advanced inspection capability. This effort builds on past free-flying inspector development efforts such as the Autonomous Extravehicular Activity Robotic Camera Sprint (AERCam Sprint) and Mini AERCam. Seeker was funded as an International Space Station (ISS) \"X-by\" Project, which required delivery of the vehicle approximately one year after authority to proceed and within the budget of $1.8 million. Seeker will fly onboard the NG-11 Cygnus mission in 2019 and will deploy after Cygnus' primary mission is completed. Seeker will perform inspection-like maneuvers within 50 meters of the target vehicle (Cygnus) and then dispose itself. The Seeker Guidance, Navigation, and Control (GNC) system is composed entirely of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) and space-rated COTS items, an inertial-relative Multiplicative Extended Kalman Filter (MEKF), point-to-point guidance (with various additional modes such as stationkeeping), proportional-integral translational control, phase plane rotational control, and a state machine for automated mission moding with minimal ground input.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20190000668, "endDate": "2019-02-06T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Astronautical Society", "location": "New York, NY, United States"}}, "meetingId": "48c2fdd14eaf4456bd8377ecbf366088", "id": "6584301216bb4c71b714fc0ceab58219"}], "name": "American Astronautical Society Annual Guidance and Control Conference (AAS GNC 2019)", "location": "Breckenridge, CO", "id": "48c2fdd14eaf4456bd8377ecbf366088", "startDate": "2019-02-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20190000668, "id": "d2c5fbaf85fe4e6e8c2297ef7f042b65", "publicationDate": "2019-02-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20190000668.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20190000668/downloads/20190000668.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20190000668/downloads/20190000668.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20190000668/downloads/20190000668.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
