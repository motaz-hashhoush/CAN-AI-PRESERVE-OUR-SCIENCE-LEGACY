The method was described, variously without and with the HHT name, in several prior NASA Tech Briefs articles and supporting documents. To recapitulate: The method is especially suitable for analyzing time-series data that represent nonstationary and nonlinear phenomena including physical phenomena and, in the present case, financial-market processes. The method involves the empirical mode decomposition (EMD), in which a complicated signal is decomposed into a finite number of functions, called \"intrinsic mode functions\" (IMFs), that admit well-behaved Hilbert transforms. The HHT consists of the combination of EMD and Hilbert spectral analysis. The local energies and the instantaneous frequencies derived from the IMFs through Hilbert transforms can be used to construct an energy-frequency-time distribution, denoted a Hilbert spectrum. The instant paper begins with a discussion of prior approaches to quantification of market volatility, summarizes the HHT method, then describes the application of the method in performing time-frequency analysis of mortgage-market data from the years 1972 through 2000. Filtering by use of the EMD is shown to be useful for quantifying market volatility.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 20110014861, "id": "f7a270319bc44f55a3658cd4be1ca0c6", "publicationName": "NASA Tech Briefs, April 2005", "publicationDate": "2005-04-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 20110014845, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "NASA Tech Briefs, April 2005", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20110014861.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20110014861/downloads/20110014861.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20110014861/downloads/20110014861.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20110014861/downloads/20110014861.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
