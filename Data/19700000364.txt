In the case\nof an array of elements, it is desirable to use a thin\nfilm interconnection from each semiconductor wafer\nto external conductors. Existing techniques for such\ninterconnection have not provided an adequate heat\nsink for satisfactory operation.\n\nThe solution:\nA module, for interconnecting a semiconductor\narray to external leads or components, which incorporates a metal external heat sink for cooling the\n\nThe semiconductor wafer (InAs array) is bonded\ndirectly to a metal heat sink by a thermally conductive\nmaterial such as a solder or appropriate metal alloy\n(see fig.). Lead patterns are provided by printed circuit\nboards which allow external connections to be brought\nto a coplanar surface adjacent to the array. The printed\ncircuit boards are placed at angles so that the cross\nsection of the copper pattern is enlarged. The coplana"r\nsurface between the printed circuit leads and the array\nis formed by casting a thermosetting plastic around\nthe heat sink and printed circuit boards, thus maintaining them in proper alignment. Interconnection\nfrom the array to the printed circuit boards is provided\nby evaporating thin film metal leads across the surface\nof the semiconductor and plastic to the exposed\nprinted circuit leads.\n\nNotes:\n1. This technique has been implemented for 50-element InAs arrays with satisfactory operation at\n80cC, the normal operating temperature of InAs\ndevices.\n2.
