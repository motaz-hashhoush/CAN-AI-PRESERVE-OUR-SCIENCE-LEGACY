The shuttle and other missions that have delivered science research facilities to the ISS are shown. The different research facilities provided by both NASA and partner organizations available for use and future facilities are reviewed. The science that has been already completed is discussed. The research facilitates the Vision for Space Exploration, in Human Life Sciences, Biological Sciences, Materials Science, Fluids Science, Combustion Science, and all other sciences. The ISS Focus for NASA involves: Astronaut health and countermeasure, development to protect crews from the space environment during long duration voyages, Testing research and technology developments for future exploration missions, Developing and validating operational procedures for long-duration space missions. The ISS Medical Project (ISSMP) address both space systems and human systems. ISSMP has been developed to maximize the utilization of ISS to obtain solutions to the human health and performance problems and the associated mission risks of exploration class missions. Including complete programmatic review with medical operations (space medicine/flight surgeons) to identify: (1) evidence base on risks (2) gap analysis.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20070023390, "endDate": "2007-06-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "MISSE Symposium, 2007 National Space and Missile", "location": "Keystone, CO", "id": "c79f6d98de19416bb30bcbfe2afc2e39", "startDate": "2007-06-28T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20070023390, "id": "4e84362b9cdc42ffa9f7cfb41b16935d", "publicationDate": "2007-06-28T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20070023390.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20070023390/downloads/20070023390.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20070023390/downloads/20070023390.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20070023390/downloads/20070023390.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
