These can\nand will be described from many points of view.\nTo us Constellation was born of the charred debris, scattered in the Piney Woods of East\nTexas, that were reverently collected as the last remains of that delicate machine Columbia , she\nthat failed to preserve the lives of our friends and colleagues due to our own very human errors.\nThe painful acknowledgement of those errors became foundational principles for what later\nemerged as the nation\xe2\x80\x99s new space exploration program: Constellation.\nFor those of us who worked it, the program bound us by a common belief that America\xe2\x80\x99s future\nlies in the Final Frontier; indeed that America must lead the way there. We joyfully dedicated our\nworking lives and careers to building the ships that would sail those treacherous seas. We had\nprepared ourselves for this challenge, having learned from the best and honed our skills in the\nunique arena of human space flight. We were driven by the hope that America would one day\nstep beyond the known, and were blessed when, for a moment, the national will bent towards\nour dreams. It was a privilege and an honor to have a hand in this endeavor. Perhaps our\ngreatest shared joy and satisfaction came from the recognition that amid the inherent tumult of a\nprogram of this size and scope, we bore the challenges with teammates of superior skill and\ndedication. We understood that another generation would explore using what we had conceived\nand built. We rejoiced at our successes, but we also knew faults and failures. This, the\nsummation of what we have learned, is our final expression of that cherished hope.\nTo our families, we beg your forgiveness for the long hours away and too many distracted\nconversations. Thank you for indulging our passion.\nAnd, to our generational forebears in human space flight, our hope is that our efforts honor you.\n\nVol. I Executive Summary\n\nPage iv\n\nConstellation Program\n\nLessons Learned Volume I\n\nCONTENTS\nForeword.................................................................................................................................... iv\nContents .....................................................................................................................................v\nPreface ..................................................................................................................................... vii\n1.0\n\nIntroduction ..................................................................................................................... 1\n\n2.0\n\nContext \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cWHERE YOU STAND DEPENDS ON WHERE YOU SIT\xe2\x80\x9d ............................ 2\n\n2.1\n\nA Brief Description of the Program ............................................................................... 2\n\n2.2\n\nThe Program Environment \xe2\x80\x94 Key to Understanding the Lessons Learned.................. 4\n\n2.2.1\n\nProgram Scope ..................................................................................................... 4\n\n2.2.2\n\nProgram Funding .................................................................................................. 4\n\n2.2.3\n\nThe Mosaic of NASA Participation ........................................................................ 8\n\n2.2.4\n\nPhasing of Project/Program Start-up..................................................................... 9\n\n3.0\n\nKey Findings ..................................................................................................................11\n\n4.0\n\nLessons Learned ............................................................................................................12\n\n4.1\n\nRobust vs. Optimal Planning \xe2\x80\x94 The Only Certainty Is that the Funding Will Not\nMatch the Plan ...........................................................................................................12\n\n4.2\n\nSchedule Creep and the Fixed Base \xe2\x80\x94 The Law of Diminishing Returns ...................12\n\n4.3\n\nTailoring and the Design and Construction Standards \xe2\x80\x94 Drinking from a Fire Hose ...13\n\n4.4\n\nTailoring Process Simplification \xe2\x80\x94The Law of Unexpected Consequences ................14\n\n4.5\n\nRisk-informed Design \xe2\x80\x94 Risk as a Commodity ...........................................................15\n\n4.6\n\nIn-house Tasks \xe2\x80\x94 Sustaining the NASA Institutional Base vs. Affordably\nSupporting the Programs \xe2\x80\x94 Getting from \xe2\x80\x9cor\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cand\xe2\x80\x9d ...............................................16\n\n4.7\n\nRoles, Responsibility, and Authority \xe2\x80\x94 a Non-thermodynamic Application\nof Entropy ...................................................................................................................17\n\n4.8\n\nDecision Making \xe2\x80\x94 Only as Efficient as Roles, Responsibilities, and Authorities\nAre Clear and Understood ..........................................................................................19\n\n4.9\n\nOrganization Is Organic \xe2\x80\x94 You\xe2\x80\x99ll Never Get It Right, But You Can Make It Better ......21\n\nVol. I Executive Summary\n\nPage v\n\nConstellation Program\n\nLessons Learned Volume I\n\n4.10\n\nCommunication Among a Far-flung Team \xe2\x80\x94 Interpersonal Networks and\nInformation Techology Applications Can Improve Bandwidth......................................22\n\n4.11\n\nFlight Tests \xe2\x80\x94 Learning by Doing ...............................................................................23\n\n5.0\n\nDevelopment Process, Knowledge Capture, and Contributors .......................................25\n\nAppendix A.

Learning from the experience of others is the next\nbest thing. Both are an exercise in judgment. Sifting the useful kernels in a chaos of chaff\nrequires perception and oftentimes detachment. We have attempted to present these lessons in\na manner that allows this, and a format that can enable rapid learning in this context.\nThis document (Volume I) provides an executive summary of the lessons learned from the\nConstellation Program. A companion document (Volume II) provides more detailed analyses for\nthose seeking further insight and information.\nIn this volume, Section 1.0 introduces the approach in preparing and organizing the content to\nenable rapid assimilation of the lessons. Section 2.0 describes the contextual framework in\nwhich the Constellation Program was formulated and functioned, which is necessary to\nunderstand most of the lessons. Context of a former program may seem irrelevant in the heady\ndays of new program formulation. However, readers should take some time to understand the\ncontext. Many of the lessons would be different in a different context, so the reader should\nreflect on the similarities and differences in his or her current circumstances. Section 3.0\nsummarizes key findings, at the program level, developed from the significant lessons learned\nthat appear in Section 4.0. Readers can use the key findings in Section 3.0 to peruse for\nparticular topics, and will find more supporting detail and analyses in a topical format in Section\n4.0. Appendix A contains a white paper describing the Constellation Program formulation that\nmay be of use to readers wanting more context or background information.\nThe reader will no doubt recognize some very similar themes from previous lessons learned,\nblue-ribbon committee reviews, National Academy reviews, and advisory panel reviews for this\nand other large-scale human space flight programs; including Apollo, Space Shuttle, Shuttle/Mir,\nand the International Space Station. This could signal an inability to learn lessons from previous\ngenerations; however, it is more likely that similar challenges persist in the Agency structure and\napproach to program formulation, budget advocacy, and management. Perhaps the greatest\nvalue of these Constellation lessons learned can be found in viewing them in context with these\nprevious efforts to guide and advise the Agency and its stakeholders.\n\nVol. I Executive Summary\n\nPage vii\n\nConstellation Program\n\nLessons Learned Volume I\n\n1.0 INTRODUCTION\nThese lessons learned are part of a suite of hardware, software, test results, designs,\nknowledge base, and documentation that comprises the legacy of the Constellation Program.\nThe context, summary information, and lessons learned are presented in a factual format, as\nknown and described at the time. While our opinions might be discernable in context, we have\navoided all but factually sustainable statements. Statements should not be viewed as either\npositive or negative; their value lies in what we did and what we learned that is worthy of\npassing on.\nThe lessons include both \xe2\x80\x9cdos\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99ts.\xe2\x80\x9d In many cases, one person\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cdo\xe2\x80\x9d can be viewed as\nanother person\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t\xe2\x80\x9d; therefore, we have attempted to capture both perspectives when\napplicable and useful.\nThe lessons have been formatted with a description together with supporting information, a\nsuccinct statement of the lesson learned, and recommendations for future programs and\nprojects that may be placed in similar circumstances.\nSupporting information, along with more detail on the Constellation Program, can be found in\nAppendix A and the companion Volume II.\n\nVol. I Executive Summary\n\nPage 1\n\nConstellation Program\n\nLessons Learned Volume I\n\n2.0 CONTEXT \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x9cWHERE YOU STAND DEPENDS ON\nWHERE YOU SIT\xe2\x80\x9d\n2.1\n\nA Brief Description of the Program\n\nNASA formed the Constellation Program in 2005 to achieve the objectives of maintaining\nAmerican presence in low-Earth orbit, returning to the moon for purposes of establishing an\noutpost, and laying the foundation to explore Mars and beyond in the first half of the 21st\ncentury. The Constellation Program\xe2\x80\x99s heritage rested on the successes and lessons learned\nfrom NASA\xe2\x80\x99s previous human space flight programs: Mercury, Gemini, Apollo, Space Shuttle,\nand the International Space Station (ISS).\nFollowing the loss of Columbia, NASA established the Columbia Accident Investigation Board\n(CAIB) to perform an in-depth review of the Space Shuttle Program. As a result of this review,\nthe CAIB concluded that it was in the best interest of the U.S. to develop a replacement for the\nspace shuttle. The CAIB concluded that it should be possible, using past and future investments\nin technology, to develop the basis for a system \xe2\x80\x9csignificantly improved over one designed 40\nyears earlier, for carrying humans to orbit and enabling their work in space.\xe2\x80\x9d\nIn January 2004, The White House issued a new exploration initiative to return humans to the\nmoon by 2020 in preparation for the human exploration of Mars and beyond. As part of this\ninitiative, NASA would continue to use the space shuttle to fulfill its obligation to complete\nassembly of the ISS and then retire the space shuttle by 2010. NASA would also build and fly a\nnew Crew Exploration Vehicle (since named Orion) by 2014. In 2005, Congress expressly\nendorsed the President\xe2\x80\x99s exploration initiative and authorized NASA to \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\xa6establish a program\nto develop a sustained human presence on the moon, including a robust precursor program to\npromote exploration, science, commerce and U.S. preeminence in space, and as a stepping\nstone to future exploration of Mars and other destinations.\xe2\x80\x9d\nIn response to the Presidential direction, the Agency formed the Exploration Systems Mission\nDirectorate (ESMD) at NASA Headquarters in 2004 to oversee development of exploration\nprograms. The Constellation Systems Division was initiated to oversee the human exploration\nmission development.\nIn May 2005, the NASA Administrator commissioned the Exploration Systems Architecture\nStudy (ESAS), a 60-day study to perform the task of defining the top-level requirements and\nconfigurations for crew and cargo launch systems to support exploration objectives. The study\nconcluded that the launch vehicles should be derived from existing technologies, leveraging the\nlessons learned from past programs. The ESAS recommended an architecture that formed the\nbasis of the Constellation Program.\nFor those interested, Appendix A contains a paper that describes in more detail the rationale\nbehind the formulation of the Constellation Program, including organizational structure and\nworkforce structure, as well as the approaches to requirements generation, budget formulation,\noperational philosophies, and procurement strategies.\nVol. I Executive Summary\n\nPage 2\n\nConstellation Program\n\nLessons Learned Volume I\n\nSince exploration of the moon and beyond was the overarching goal of the Constellation\nProgram, all elements were designed to perform the lunar missions, while also being capable of\nperforming missions to the ISS. The program was phased as a stepwise capability buildup that\nwas largely based on space shuttle heritage components. The Initial Capability (IC) comprised\nelements necessary to service the ISS by 2015 with crew rotations: including the Orion Crew\nExploration Vehicle, the Ares I Crew Launch Vehicle, and the supporting ground and mission\ninfrastructure to enable these missions. The Constellation Lunar Capability (LC) added the Ares\nV Cargo Launch Vehicle, the Altair Lunar Lander, and spacesuits designed for partial-gravity\nexploration. Lunar Outpost elements and capabilities were to follow, including mobility elements\nsuch as rovers, permanent or semipermanent habitats, and power and communication elements\nto support a sustained exploration presence.\nThe Constellation Program was managed at the Johnson Space Center (JSC), with the\nfollowing seven \xe2\x80\x9chardware development\xe2\x80\x9d project offices:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nCrew Exploration Vehicle Project (the Orion spacecraft), at JSC\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nExploration Launch Projects (the Ares I and Ares V launch vehicles), at the Marshall Space\nFlight Center (MSFC)\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nGround Operations Project (development of launch and recovery facilities) at the Kennedy\nSpace Center (KSC)\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nMission Operations Project (development of flight and mission control facilities) at JSC\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nExtravehicular Activity (EVA) Systems Project (spacesuit and tool development) at JSC\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nLunar Lander Project (the Altair lunar descent and ascent module) at JSC\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nLunar Surface Systems Pre-project (advanced planning for lunar habitats and surface\nsupport systems) at JSC\n\nOrion, Ares I, Ground Operations, Mission Operations, and EVA comprised the IC projects. Ares\nV, the Altair and Lunar Surface Systems, along with upgrades to the IC to meet lunar interfaces\nand requirements, comprised the LC projects.\nBy 2010, all elements of the IC had achieved Preliminary Design Review (PDR), and test flights\nwere under way, with the successful launches of Ares I-X and the Orion Pad Abort-1 tests. The\nWhite House announced the cancellation of the program on Feb. 1, 2010, on the seventh\nanniversary of the loss of Columbia and her crew.\nAccording to the NASA Authorization Act of 2010 (PL 111-267, Oct. 11, 2010), elements of the\nConstellation Program will continue in NASA\xe2\x80\x99s current planning. The Orion vehicle is redesigned\nas the Multi-Purpose Crewed Vechicle (MPCV) and will likely enable crew launch on a variety of\nlaunch vehicles. The Space Launch System (SLS), intended as the vehicle to launch crews and\ncargo beyond Low Earth Orbit (LEO), has various configurations under consideration including\noptions based on space shuttle and Ares heritage designs and hardware. The Ground\n\nVol. I Executive Summary\n\nPage 3\n\nConstellation Program\n\nLessons Learned Volume I\n\nOperations infrastructure at KSC, developed for Constellation, will be adapted to the SLS and\nnew commercial launch capabilities.\n\n2.2\n2.2.1\n\nThe Program Environment \xe2\x80\x94 Key to Understanding the Lessons Learned\nProgram Scope\n\nThe Constellation Program was conceived as a multi-decadal undertaking, with the primary goal\nof enabling human exploration beyond LEO. It was to serve as the space shuttle\xe2\x80\x99s successor\nnot only in function but also in utilization of facilities and work force. It was to provide the primary\nmode of delivery of crews to the ISS, enable the construction and operation of an outpost on the\nmoon, and enable human exploration of Mars. Constellation, as the Agency\xe2\x80\x99s flagship program,\nspanned all 10 NASA centers and multiple large-scale acquisitions. It required modernizing an\ninfrastructure that had been designed and sized largely for the Apollo Program in the 1960s.\nMoreover, it required leading a work force that was generationally removed from the previous\nhuman spacecraft launch and entry development challenges.\nWhile the near-term focus of the program was providing crew transport to the ISS via the IC, the\ncapability to go beyond LEO drove many of the technical and programmatic decisions. These\ndecisions were suboptimal when viewed with only near-term objectives in mind, while they were\nnecessary to support the LC phases of the program. They also, in some cases, increased risk to\nthe IC through incorporation of newer technologies with less flight heritage. The need for\ncommonality to decrease life-cycle cost and complexity drove many decisions. For example, the\nAres I design used a five-segment, solid-chemical first stage along with the J2-X upper stage\nengine. Other simpler, less-costly designs could have been used to optimize development for\nthe Ares I alone, but, in context with the Ares V development, these elements lowered the\noverall program design complexity, risk, and cost.\nOptimization for the long-term program drove not only design decisions but also infrastructure\nneeds, standards, organizational structure, units of measure (SI), data architecture, etc., that\nwould not have been necessary for the IC alone. The primary objective of stepping beyond LEO\nwith the LC was optimized at the expense of having an IC that was more costly and complex\nthan necessary as a stand-alone development.\n2.2.2\n\nProgram Funding\n\nFunding for the Constellation Program was inconsistent and unreliable from its initial formulation\nthrough its cancellation. Indeed, this inconsistency became the chronic constraint that\naggravated all other constraints. Figure 1 illustrates this persistent problem. The program\nexperienced a 10% budget cut prior to PDR. The \xe2\x80\x9cprofile\xe2\x80\x9d was far less than optimal for a\ndevelopment project. The funding \xe2\x80\x9cnotch\xe2\x80\x9d in fiscal year 2010 (FY10) was a result of Agency\nfunding limitations due to space shuttle retirement. While Constellation was expected to\ntransport crews to and from ISS soon after space shuttle retirement, the funding ramp-up\nneeded for development was not available until after the space shuttle was retired. This, of\n\nVol. I Executive Summary\n\nPage 4\n\nConstellation Program\n\nLessons Learned Volume I\n\ncourse, put pressure on the program content, schedule, and rationale for the ISS crew rotation\nmission (Initial Operational Capability [IOC]).\n\n6,000\n\nCx IOC\nBudget\nProfile\n\nTypical Development Curve\n4,500\n\n3,000\n$ in M\n\nBudget Reductions in\nearly years = budget overruns\nin out-years to achieve\nsimilar schedule\n1,500\n\n0\nFY06\n\nFY07\n\nFY08\n\nFY09\n\nESAS\n\nFY10\n\nFY11\n\nPMR09\n\nFY12\n\nFY13\n\nFY14\n\nFY15\n\n2010 PBS\n\n12,000\n\n9,000\n\n6,000\n\n3,000\n\n0\nFY06\n\nFY07\n\nFY08\n\nFY09\n\nFY10\n\nFY11\n\nFY12\n\nFY13\n\nFY14\n\nFY15\n\nFY16\n\nFY17\n\nFY18\n\nFY19\n\nFY20\n\nRY$ In M\nESAS\nPMR09\n2010 PBS\n\nFY06\n2,333\n1707\n1707\n\nFY07\n2,976\n1779\n1779\n\nFY08\n3,195\n2514\n2514\n\nFY09\n4,202\n3085\n3085\n\nFY10\n5,034\n3454\n3454\n\nFY11\n7,273\n6085\n5524\n\nFY12\n7,994\n6346\n5444\n\nFY13\n8,324\n6991\n5376\n\nFY14\n8,558\n7145\n5570\n\nFY15\n8,948\n7856\n6153\n\nFY16\n9,547\n9145\n6161\n\nFY17\n11,107\n9983\n6170\n\nFY18\n11,422\n10294\n6178\n\nFY19\n11,744\n10582\n6186\n\nFY20\n12,073\n10854\n6195\n\nTotal\n114730\n97820\n71496\n\nPMR09 vs. ESAS Delta\nPassback vs. ESAS Delta\n\n(626)\n(626)\n\n(1197)\n(1197)\n\n(681)\n(681)\n\n(1117)\n(1117)\n\n(1580)\n(1580)\n\n(1188)\n(1749)\n\n(1648)\n(2550)\n\n(1333)\n(2948)\n\n(1413)\n(2988)\n\n(1092)\n(2795)\n\n(402)\n(3386)\n\n(1124)\n(4937)\n\n(1128)\n(5244)\n\n(1162)\n(5558)\n\n(1219)\n(5878)\n\n(16910)\n(43234)\n\nFig. 1: Constellation budget profiles before and after budget reductions (ESAS=the initial program\nbudget baseline; PMR=Program Manager\xe2\x80\x99s Recommendation; PBS=President\xe2\x80\x99s Budget Submittal)\nFigure 2 illustrates the result of the budget pressure on major schedule milestones (PDR, Critical\nDesign Review [CDR], IOC, and human lunar return [HLR]). IOC moved 2 years (2012 to 2014)\ndue to the first budget cut. The program was able to recapture 1 year of that loss by replanning\n(at greater risk). Subsequent budget cuts pushed IOC further, into 2015. The program was\nrequired to hold the IOC schedule commitment to 2015, since this was the \xe2\x80\x9cno later than\xe2\x80\x9d date\nthat was committed to Congress.\n\nVol. I Executive Summary\n\nPage 5\n\nConstellation Program\n\nLessons Learned Volume I\n\nFig. 2: Consequences of funding cuts on Constellation major milestones\nThe phasing of the program exacerbated the funding challenges, in a \xe2\x80\x9crob Peter to pay Paul\xe2\x80\x9d\nfashion. The viability of the lunar program phase was under constant threat, as it was the only\nsouce to supplement shortfalls in the IC when schedule slips had been exhausted (see effect of\nthe fixed-base costs, below). The lunar phase of the program (e.g., HLR in Fig. 2) bore the brunt\nof the cuts that could be accommodated in out-years and was pushed even further than the IOC\nmilestones. This is illustrated in Fig. 2 (observe that IOC was \xe2\x80\x9cheld\xe2\x80\x9d in 2015 while HLR slipped\nalmost 2 years).\nConstellation was planned with adequate budget reserves, although these reserves were not\nphased to be most useful to the program (i.e., much of the reserve was phased later in the\nprogram schedule rather than earlier). An unfortunately prevalent perspective on program\nreserves in the federal government is that reserves are seen as \xe2\x80\x9cover funding\xe2\x80\x9d that can be\ndepleted to address other issues or drawn back to the Treasury if unused within 1 fiscal year.\nAgency reserves (i.e., allowance for program adjustment [APA] funds) had been long ago\neliminated. Constellation reserves were intially planned to fund risk mitigation efforts. Reserves\nwere rapidly depleted due to the combined effects of budget cuts, Agency \xe2\x80\x9ctaxes,\xe2\x80\x9d and efforts to\nhold schedule without sacrificing content. Subsequently, risk mitigations were reduced and then\neliminated, leaving little recourse to resolve the typical technical challenges that crop up in a\ndesign of this magnitude and complexity. Risk accrued as a result.\nThe large acquisitions for design and construction of the major components of the program were\nplanned, sized, and budgeted early in the program, as was neccessitated to meet schedule\nVol. I Executive Summary\n\nPage 6\n\nConstellation Program\n\nLessons Learned Volume I\n\nobjectives. The prime contractors\xe2\x80\x99 costs typically ramped up in accordance with plan. These\ncosts were comprised of both \xe2\x80\x9dfixed-base\xe2\x80\x9d elements (work force, test facilities, etc.), and\nvariable elements. As the program dealt with subsequent budget cuts, the fixed-base elements\nwere extremely difficult to reduce; cuts tended to be absorbed within the variable elements (e.g.,\ndeferred hardware buys). This led to a number of problems: it increased schedule risk as more\nactivities crept onto the critical path; it deferred activities planned to reduce risk, delaying risk\nmitigation strategies and increasing overall risk; and it also became an exercise in diminished\nreturns \xe2\x80\x94 fewer and fewer items remained in the variable elements of the budget to defer in the\nnext round of reductions.\nWith the retirement of the Space Shuttle Program looming, great pressure was exerted to\nassimilate as much of the shuttle-heritage \xe2\x80\x9cfixed base\xe2\x80\x9d (e.g., work force, infrastructure, and\nindustrial base) from that program as possible, per direction NASA received in two Authorization\nActs (2005, 2008). While the operational requirements and sustaining budget planned for\nConstellation were smaller than that of the Space Shuttle Program, nearly every component,\nbuilding, fleet, process, and cadre of workers had its advocacy group to sustain it. Because of\nthe phasing of the Constellation Program, much of the infrastructure was not needed for the IC\nbut would be needed for the LC. This created an Agency-wide phasing challenge for these\nassets: retire/mothball the asset, or sustain it for many years unused?\nThe tight coupling of the space shuttle retirement to the buildup of the Constellation IC, along\nwith the necessity to plan the IC and LC with a large degree of commonality, made sense\nstrategically when the plan was developed, but only if all of the schedule and funding\nassumptions held. The rationale did not withstand subsequent budget pressure and\nconsequential schedule slips.\nWhile the Constellation Program hardware development budget was also large in an absolute\nsense at the Agency level, it was not yet operational (as space shuttle and ISS), so it was often\nperceived as the only source for unexpected expenses that cropped up in the Agency. Indeed,\nexpenses were charged to the program that had no benefit to the program. This is not atypical\nfor flagship programs in governmental developments.\nCash flow disruptions, resulting from Congressional continuing resolutions (CRs), had been an\noccasional source of funding problems for the Agency in the past. During Constellation\xe2\x80\x99s\nlifetime, these became annual events that many times lasted well into the new fiscal year. While\nthese are experienced government wide, they are particularly onerous on developmental\nprograms in early stages when funding levels are increasing toward their peak.

These funding shortfalls sent annual\n\xe2\x80\x9csquare waves\xe2\x80\x9d of additional re-planning through the program, projects, and contractor\ncommunities.

This distribution was planned at the Agency level. The concept was not sufficiently defined to\nsatisfy either centers or the program in light of the space shuttle retirement. Details of the\nimplementation were left to the program to sort out in consultation with center management.\nThis resulted in a persistent tension between what was most efficient for the program vs. what\nwas best for a particular NASA center to sustain or grow its current role. The nationwide team\nwas probably larger than necessary, but it also covered \xe2\x80\x9cunused capacity\xe2\x80\x9d at some centers. The\nlarge teams at multiple locations led to instances of overlapping or unclear roles and\nresponsibilities. Decisions to perform tasks \xe2\x80\x9cin-house\xe2\x80\x9d using on-site work force at a center vs.\ncontracting the task out were often made at the center or project level, and were not optimized\nfor overall program benefit.\nThe involvement of all 10 NASA centers exposed cultural differences that had to be managed\nby a management team that was geographically removed. Each center had different\nrequirements, procedures, and processes, which were documented at various levels of detail\nand constraint. While these were useful to each center, the Agency had not completed an effort\nto assure that they were consistent, non-duplicative, and noncontradictory. This was a particular\nburden on the contractor community since it was charged with identification and compliance\nwith duplicative and sometimes contradictory requirements. The mismatch of design and\nconstruction standards among centers, along with demands from the \xe2\x80\x9cinsight\xe2\x80\x9d work force at\neach center, was a worrisome burden for the contractors, constantly threatening their ability to\nmeet schedule milestones and cost thresholds. NASA\xe2\x80\x99s use of an independent technical\nauthority provided yet another source of direction and, thus, confusion to the contractor\ncommunity. Contractors had difficulty distinguishing final decisions coming from the Agency,\nsince direction could come from the program or the technical authority.\nThe industrial base used by the Space Shuttle Program and, to a lesser extent, the ISS\nProgram was managed by a separate mission directorate at NASA HQ. Overlapping strategic\ninterests among the three programs (e.g., facility usage, floor space, test stands) had to be\nresolved at the highest levels in the Agency (i.e., between mission directorates).\nThe position of an Agency flagship program carried benefits as well. The program had access to\nthe entire Agency knowledge base, along with skills and infrastructure. The program was\nviewed as high priority at all centers, since it represented a path to a sustainable and growing\nrole in most areas of expertise. Engagement of nontraditional human space flight centers\nallowed the program to tap into unique skills, approaches, and facilities. The contractors\nbenefited from NASA\xe2\x80\x99s technical depth and expertise, along with access to unique facilities\n(e.g., engine test stands, large vacuum chambers). The early test flights, Ares I-X and Orion\nPad Abort-1, demonstrated the benefits of multicenter teams. These projects were successful\nVol. I Executive Summary\n\nPage 8\n\nConstellation Program\n\nLessons Learned Volume I\n\nearly pathfinders in identifying and resolving the problems that could arise from a conflict of\ncultures in design, testing, and manufacturing.\n\nFig. 3: The Constellation distributed team\n2.2.4\n\nPhasing of Project/Program Start-up\n\nTwo of the primary projects, the Orion Crew Exploration Vehicle and the Ares Crew Launch\nVehicle, were begun well in advance of the Constellation Program. This enabled rapid start-up\nand early results from each project. They functioned for some time without an integration\nfunction between them, which led to an eventual Program Integration (PI) function that was very\nlean by historical norms. 1 The rapid start-up enabled rapid contract competition. However, these\ncontracts were not fully scoped for the physical and analytical integration that was necessary.\nThey were instead focussed on the IC, since trade studies had not been performed that would\noptimize an integrated architecture. These factors led to costly contract changes when the\nappropriate level of integration for a complete architecture was better understood.\nThis approach also provided an additional integration challenge. The projects had formed\nrequirements, budgets, design approaches, acquisition strategies, etc., that needed to be\n\n1\n\nA typical large space flight program historically used approximately 10% to 15% of its budget for PI. The\nConstellation Program was relatively lean, spending 5% to 7.5% on these functions.\n\nVol. I Executive Summary\n\nPage 9\n\nConstellation Program\n\nLessons Learned Volume I\n\nintegrated retroactively. The late addition of the integrating functions had a long-term effect that\nwas not fully resolved by the end of the program. Strategies that were in a collective self-interest\nfor the program were extraordinarily difficult to implement due to the cost of contract changes.\nExamples of these include unit policy (SI vs. heritage units of design and construction), data\narchitecture, and facilities management. Boards and panels formed prior to the program office\nhad different structures and responsibilities. Integration of these into a program board and panel\nstructure confounded decision making. Moreover, integrated analyses by the program\nuncovered technical issues that could have been caught earlier (and been resolved in a more\nefficient manner) if the start-up timing had been different. 2\nIncentives on contracts were developed primarily to benefit each project rather than the overall\nprogram. Missing were incentives for contractors to participate in technical solutions that benefit\nthe integrated program. This drove results that were less than optimum, and sometimes not\nmutually compatible.\n\n2\n\nAn example of this is what became known as the \xe2\x80\x9cthrust oscillation\xe2\x80\x9d issue. Integrated analyses indicated\nthat unacceptably large thrust oscillations from the Ares I first-stage burn could be transmitted through the\nstack to the flight crew in the Orion vehicle during launch. Design changes were implemented in the PDR\ntime frame to mechanically dampen the oscillations and sufficiently isolate the crew. We can speculate\nthat earlier identification could have resulted in simpler, lower cost changes.\nVol. I Executive Summary\n\nPage 10\n\nConstellation Program\n\nLessons Learned Volume I\n\n3.0 KEY FINDINGS\nGiven the challenges described in Section 2.0, the following is a brief listing of the key findings\ndistilled from the Constellation Program. Explanatory information can be found in Section 4.0,\nand further detail is contained in Volume II. This list is hot linked to explanatory information in\nthe electronic version of this document.\nThe character of these lessons is worth noting. The reader will observe that very few technical\nissues arose that could not be solved in relatively short order; rather, the most difficult and most\npersistent challenges involved cost, schedule, and organization. The reader will no doubt\nrecognize this pattern from previous large-program lessons learned. While the Agency is\nrenowned for its technical prowess, senior managers in flagship programs can be faced with a\nmultitude of nontechnical challenges for which they have far less training or preparation. In this\nrespect, lessons learned can be an invaluable source of insight.\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nRobust vs. optimal planning\xe2\x80\x94the only certainty is that funding will not match the plan\nSchedule creep and the fixed base\xe2\x80\x94the law of diminishing returns\nTailoring and the design and construction standards\xe2\x80\x94drinking from a fire hose\nTailoring process simplification\xe2\x80\x94the law of unexpected consequences\nRisk-informed design\xe2\x80\x94risk as a commodity\nIn-house tasks\xe2\x80\x94sustaining the NASA institutional base vs. affordably supporting the\nprograms\xe2\x80\x94getting from \xe2\x80\x9cor\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cand\xe2\x80\x9d\nRoles, responsibility, and authority (RRA)\xe2\x80\x94a non-thermodynamic application of\nentropy\nDecision making\xe2\x80\x94is only as efficient as RRAs are clear and understood\nOrganization is organic\xe2\x80\x94you will never get it right, but you can make it better\nCommunication among a far-flung team\xe2\x80\x94interpersonal networks and information\ntechnology (IT) applications can improve bandwidth\nFlight tests\xe2\x80\x94learning by doing\n\nVol. I Executive Summary\n\nPage 11\n\nConstellation Program\n\nLessons Learned Volume I\n\n4.0 LESSONS LEARNED\n4.1\n\nRobust vs. Optimal Planning \xe2\x80\x94 The Only Certainty Is that the Funding Will\nNot Match the Plan\n\nDriving Events\nSection 2.1 describes the context and driving events for the funding and planning challenges\nfaced by the Constellation Program. Constellation found itself in a grounds-up re-plan at least\nannually.\nLessons Learned\nThe reality is that Agency flagship programs like Constellation must be robustly planned (e.g.,\n\xe2\x80\x9celastic\xe2\x80\x9d) vs. optimally planned (\xe2\x80\x9cinelastic\xe2\x80\x9d). Absent a national imperative akin to the race to the\nmoon, funding will not arrive as planned. Flagship programs are highly visible and stand alone\nin the national-level budget debates. As they are not part of a budget portfolio, they cannot look\nelsewhere for funding.\nA flagship program will never experience complete alignment of the budget with the plan, either\nin net or in phasing. Therefore, flagship programs should resist the urge to optimally plan each\nbudget line item.\nRecommendation\nPlan for CRs for the first quarter of each fiscal year until and unless Congressional processes\nchange substantially.\nDecouple programs/projects as much as possible in strategic, programmatic, and technical\naspects.\nProactively determine sensitivities and breakpoints in budgets, and communicate these to\nstakeholders a priori. Establish expectations for funding reductions in advance. This is the best\nhope to influence budget decisions.\nDevelop scenario(s) to accommodate 5% to 10% funding shortfalls in any given fiscal year.\nUnderstand the major drivers to cost and options available (i.e., \xe2\x80\x9cthe knobs to turn\xe2\x80\x9d) when\nunexpected challenges appear.\n\n4.2\n\nSchedule Creep and the Fixed Base \xe2\x80\x94 The Law of Diminishing Returns\n\nDriving Events\nAs discussed in Section 2.2, the Constellation Program dealt with funding cuts primarily through\nschedule slips rather than content reductions (due to NASA Administrator direction). Variable\ncosts are early targets, since they can be deferred (while adding program risk). The fixed-base\n\nVol. I Executive Summary\n\nPage 12\n\nConstellation Program\n\nLessons Learned Volume I\n\ncosts \xe2\x80\x94 both within the Agency and for the contractors \xe2\x80\x94 become proportionally larger, making\nschedule slips less and less effective in addressing cost cuts.\nLessons Learned\nEach schedule slip resulted in longer periods for which Constellation was expected to maintain\nthe Agency\xe2\x80\x99s human space flight \xe2\x80\x9cfixed base\xe2\x80\x9d along with the industrial fixed base from its suite of\nacquisitions. This had the effect of reducing the overall cost savings being sought from the\ninitiating event \xe2\x80\x94 the funding cut. A vicious cycle was established that only grew more severe\nduring the life of the program as more and more time supporting the fixed base was added to\nthe program lifetime. Ultimately it could not be resolved without addressing content reductions.\nRecommendation\nUnderstand the inherent limitations of schedule slippage to resolve funding shortfalls, since\naccrual of the fixed-base portion of the budget erodes the buying power in out-year funding.\nReduction of program content warrants consideration under these circumstances.\n\n4.3\n\nTailoring and the Design and Construction Standards \xe2\x80\x94 Drinking from a\nFire Hose\n\nDriving Events\nThe involvement of the 10 NASA centers (described in Section 2.2.3, Mosaic of NASA\nParticipation), along with the overabundance and over-prescriptive nature of design and\nconstruction standards led to an avalanche of \xe2\x80\x9cshall\xe2\x80\x9d requirements on the Constellation\ncontractors. While Constellation was allowed broad latitude to tailor requirements, such tailoring\nrequired rationale and negotiation with the requirement \xe2\x80\x9cholder.\xe2\x80\x9d The sheer number of direct and\nembedded requirements made the task of tailoring intractable.\nThe following illustrates the extent of the problem:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThe Orion prime contract alone levied design and construction (D&C) specifications\nfrom: 34 NASA standards, 10 Johnson (Space Center) Program Requirement (JPR)\ndocuments, 11 JSC technical standards, 3 NASA Program Directives (NPDs), 6 NASA\nProgram Requirements (NPRs), and 11 KSC standards. These included:\no NASA STD 8739.3, Soldered Electrical Connections \xe2\x80\x93 a 93-page document with\n391 \xe2\x80\x9cshall\xe2\x80\x9d statements inclusive of room temperature/relative humidity and 1077\nlumens of light per square meter or 100 foot candles on the work surface.\no NASA STD 8739.4, Crimping/Cables/Harnesses/Wiring \xe2\x80\x93 a 66-page document\ncontaining 391 \xe2\x80\x9cshall\xe2\x80\x9d statements requiring a (a) Snell far-vision chart 20/50; (b)\nnear-vision Jaeger1 @ 355.6 mm; and (c) reduced Snell 20/20 or equivalent.\nRequires color vision testing and specifies temperature/humidity and lighting.\no NASA STD 8719.9, Standard for Lifting Devices \xe2\x80\x93 a 126-page document\ncontaining 996 \xe2\x80\x9cshall\xe2\x80\x9d statements covering use of overhead devices and powered\nand motorized devices; it also approves the use of manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s procedures\n\nVol. I Executive Summary\n\nPage 13\n\nConstellation Program\n\nLessons Learned Volume I\n\nand provides instruction on how to set the parking brakes on mobile and\nmotorized units.\nAll of the major aerospace contractors, who build systems for multiple government customers\n(Department of Defense (DoD), National Security Agency (NSA), NASA, etc.), have certified\ninternal processes and suppliers that meet both national and international standards. The set of\nNASA requirements is often redundant to this.\nLessons Learned\nThe massive quantity of D&C standards defies tailoring for even a large program such as\nConstellation. Major aerospace contractors have sufficient processes such that NASA\xe2\x80\x99s D&C\nstandards are of questionable value. This is a major driver of program-fixed costs.\nRecommendation\nNASA should assume the burden of \xe2\x80\x9cmeets or exceeds\xe2\x80\x9d evaluations on itself instead of making\nthe contractor prove it meets NASA requirements. NASA should implement this by establishing\nan experienced team to audit contractor internal processes at the NASA document level. This\nprocess should not burden the contractor with defending the adequacy of each individual\nrequirement. For the most part, the aerospace contractor community is well versed in the\nappropriate manufacturing and safety measures required to develop space hardware. NASA\nshould build on that expertise.\nCurrently, this topic (Affordability/Innovation) is the subject of discussion among the Chief\nEngineer\xe2\x80\x99s Office, the Office of the Chief Health and Medical Officer, and Safety and Mission\nAssurance (S&MA) leadership. A team has been tasked with describing a process and timeline\nfor transforming the Agency approach to Technical Authority requirements and standards. This\ninitiative should establish clear criteria for mandatory (\xe2\x80\x9cshall\xe2\x80\x9d) requirements. It should also\nrevalidate the Agency\xe2\x80\x99s current requirements base with the goal of significantly reducing the\ntotal number. Most requirements should become guidelines or best practices.\n\n4.4\n\nTailoring Process Simplification \xe2\x80\x94The Law of Unexpected Consequences\n\nDriving Events\nOne of the many findings of the CAIB was that NASA had institutionalized the waiver and\ndeviation process for requirements such that permanent or semipermanent waivers and\ndeviations to requirements were the accepted norm. The CAIB, and other committees and\npanels studying the NASA human space flight culture, questioned the quality and validity of\nrequirements that need permanent waivers or deviations to remain extant. Consequently, the\nneed to establish a waiver or deviation developed an understandable cultural taint in the work\nforce. Training after the Columbia accident reenforced this aversion. Indeed, important NASA\nstakeholders (e.g., Congress, the Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel, members of the public)\nwere keen to maintain visibility on NASA\xe2\x80\x99s use of waivers.\nVol. I Executive Summary\n\nPage 14\n\nConstellation Program\n\nLessons Learned Volume I\n\nMeanwhile, the Agency did not grapple with the plethora of requirements that drove the practical\nneed for waivers and deviations to requirements. While the Agency approach to requirements\nwas redesigned with the introduction of the independent Technical Authority, the actual number\nand scope of requirements was not addressed.\nThis left the Constellation Program in a quandary. While the Constellation Program was allowed\nbroad latitude in tailoring requirements to its needs, the Agency decided that the program would\nuse deviations and waivers to document tailoring outcomes. Cultural consequences were not\nevaluated. Moreover, the process for permanent deviations and waivers was formalized by the\nAgency. Discussions of tailoring were driven down to the level at which they were most\nproductive \xe2\x80\x94 to those most familiar with design and implementation. However, waivers and\ndeviations required higher visibility within the Agency to agree on. This cultural inconsistency,\ncoupled with the sheer number of requirements addressed in the previous lesson, made the\ntailoring process nearly insurmountable.\nLessons Learned\nWhile the use of waivers and deviations was intended to simplify the tailoring process of\nrequirements for the Constellation Program, the cultural consequences were not addressed.\nThis had the unintended consequence of confounding the tailoring process rather than assisting\nit.\nRecommendation\nTailoring of requirements is necessary and should not carry a cultural stigma. The process\nshould be revised to remedy the negative implication.\n\n4.5\n\nRisk-informed Design \xe2\x80\x94 Risk as a Commodity\n\nDriving Events\nThe broad scope of the Constellation Program permitted, to great effect, some experimentation\nin the design process. The traditional aerospace design process (i.e., the \xe2\x80\x9crule-based\xe2\x80\x9d\napproach), wherein the vehicle is designed strictly to requirements (and, by implication, all\nrequirements are equal or nearly so), was used on most elements. Two elements employed a\nrisk-based approach that resulted in overall better designs.\nThe Orion vehicle was designed initially using the rule-based approach. In meeting all\nrequirements, the vehicle was overly constrained, was too heavy, and had performance\nchallenges. To \xe2\x80\x9cclose the architecture,\xe2\x80\x9d the project implemented a revised design process that\nprioritized mission-critical, reliability, and safety requirements. A \xe2\x80\x9czero-based\xe2\x80\x9d vehicle was\ndesigned that met only these requirements. All other design features required justification based\non an ability to reduce risk, i.e., risk as a commodity, using standard risk assessment tools (e.g.,\nprobabilistic risk assessment, hazard analysis, and failure modes and effects analysis) along\nwith the beneficial use of other design commodities (e.g., power, mass, budget). The ability of\n\nVol. I Executive Summary\n\nPage 15\n\nConstellation Program\n\nLessons Learned Volume I\n\nthe Orion vehicle to minimize LOC (loss of crew) probability, along with meeting of performance\nand mass constraints, was improved through application of this process.\nThe Altair vehicle pioneered a similar approach, which was uniquely applied a priori. The Risk\nInformed Design Process used an analysis-based approach to design the absolute minimum\nvehicle necessary to perform the mission and then added design features by proven value in\nincreasing vehicle reliability and safety. This resulted in more robust design solutions that either\neliminated or better-controlled hazards.\nLessons Learned\nRisk Informed Design (i.e., treating risk as a commodity in design) was a breakthrough for both\nOrion and Altair, resulting in designs that \xe2\x80\x9cclosed\xe2\x80\x9d and were safer and more reliable than a \xe2\x80\x9crulebased\xe2\x80\x9d design approach could yield.\nRecommendation\nA rule-based design approach can remove accountability for understanding the implications of\ndesign choices. Employ risk-informed design methodology a priori to focus design on overall\nmission success rather than compliance with \xe2\x80\x9cdesign rules.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n4.6\n\nIn-house Tasks \xe2\x80\x94 Sustaining the NASA Institutional Base vs. Affordably\nSupporting the Programs \xe2\x80\x94 Getting from \xe2\x80\x9cor\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cand\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nDriving Events\nThe driving events for this lesson are described in Section 2.2.3 under \xe2\x80\x9cMosaic of NASA\nParticipation.\xe2\x80\x9d\nWhile the Constellation Program attempted to distribute work in logical packages, the competing\nneeds of \xe2\x80\x9c10 Healthy Centers,\xe2\x80\x9d the scope of the program, and phasing considerations (e.g.,\nplacement of work in the post-shuttle era) drove instances of incoherent distribution, resulting in\nmuddling of roles, responsibility, and authority.\nAn example of the Orion Launch Abort System (LAS) development further illustrates the wide\ndistribution of roles and responsibilities. This development was a subsystem of Orion and is not\nan extreme example, but it is typical of the rest of the program. Responsibilities were divided as\nfollows:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nJSC: Orion project management, lead for crew module and vehicle integration, prime\ncontractor oversight, and independent analysis\nMSFC: LAS prime contractor oversight and independent analysis\nLangley Research Center: Lead for LAS integration, prime contractor oversight, and\nindependent analysis\nGlenn Research Center: Flight Test Article and pathfinder production for service module\nand spacecraft adapter\n\nVol. I Executive Summary\n\nPage 16\n\nConstellation Program\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nLessons Learned Volume I\n\nDryden Flight Research Center: Lead for Abort Flight Test integration and operations\n\nWhen everybody is responsible for everything, nobody is responsible for any one thing.\nFurthermore, the relatively low cost of most in-house tasks can be deceiving. While sometimes\nlow in cost, the price of confused RR&A can lead to major headaches that flow into the\ncontractor infrastructure. These roles are often coupled with the desire for modernization of\nassociated host center facilities, which can drive larger costs.\nLessons Learned\nTask assignments for in-house work are strategic drivers within the Agency; they are more than\na series of make-buy or in-house vs. contractor decisions. Clear RR&As must be a priority. In\nspite of the relative low cost, the distribution and RR&A for in-house tasks are deserving of\nmanagement focus to avoid confusion and overlapping roles down the line.\nRecommendation\nTarget in-house tasks for items that mutually benefit programs (e.g., unique expertise) and\ncenters (e.g., institutional sustainment). Due diligence will be needed to achieve this balance of\nbenefit to the program and benefit to the NASA institution. A balance will bring value to the\nprogram as well as provide strategic support for the NASA institution, equipping the Agency to\naccomplish future programs and missions.\nAffordability, institutional benefit, and coherence of RR&A should be three additional strategic\nconsiderations in these decisions. Simply said, make sure the gain is worth the pain.\n\n4.7\n\nRoles, Responsibility, and Authority \xe2\x80\x94 a Non-thermodynamic Application of\nEntropy\n\nDriving Events\nThe clarity of RR&A for the Constellation Program was degraded by the combined effects of the\nwide distribution of program responsibilities via the \xe2\x80\x9c10 Healthy Centers\xe2\x80\x9d policy, multi-decadal\nphasing of the program development in IC and LC, and assumption of traditionally understood\nroles from the space shuttle heritage component development as described in Section 2.2.\nThe program undertook a number of steps to improve this, by conducting work force surveys\nand regular management retreats. Perhaps the most successful effort was the Program\nExcellence Team, a council of program deputies that frequently met face-to-face and via telecon\nto work through specific issues related to RR&A.\nLessons Learned\nThere is no formula or checklist for clear RR&A in an agency-wide flagship program. The\nspecific approach on organizational structure taken by Constellation in this regard is addressed\nin Appendix A, in the paper on formulation of the program. Projects housed at centers in which\n\nVol. I Executive Summary\n\nPage 17\n\nConstellation Program\n\nLessons Learned Volume I\n\nprevious or similar work took or takes place will tend to assume these heritage roles in spite of\ncontrary direction.\nTwo early test flights provide examples of how strong leadership and imminent schedule\nmilestones can drive improvements in RR&A and decision-making. 3 The Ares I-X test flight and\nthe Orion Pad Abort-1 test flight were both pathfinders in how to function and succeed within the\nbroad scope of the far-flung Constellation organization. Both were developed using distributed\nteams and hardware developments as the program relationships were forming. While initially\nhampered by the same factors described in this section, these teams were able to focus on the\nmost important elements and succeed in meeting all of their test flight objectives.\nRR&A can be improved through functional examination or by either combining like tasks or\nseparating functions by need. Implementation was hindered during the development of the\nIntegrated Master Schedule (IMS) by the conflicting needs of the product/task providers and the\nschedule assessment team. When these functions were separated, IMS development quickly\ngained focus and results improved.\nRisk management was challenged because it was separate functionally from cost threat\nmanagement. When broader aspects of risk (e.g., cost threats, safety, etc.) were included, the\nresults from the system improved. 4\nRR&A for the IC was relatively clear and in daily operation. Roles for the LC, while defined at a\ntop level, were best developed for projects that had \xe2\x80\x9cfollow-on\xe2\x80\x9d content from the IC.\nThe program was also contemplating the roles the International Partners might take. This\nformulation is described in Volume 2, for interested readers.\nRecommendation\nA good start is important to define RR&A; however, periodic examination is required for largescope, distributed programs. Attention to the effects of heritage RR&A and phasing are\nparticularly important. RR&A should also be planned to adapt to the program phase(s).\nCreating a dedicated team of decision makers (e.g., the council of deputies) to critically review\nand address RR&A can be very effective.\nUse of annual employee surveys provides a useful metric toward gauging the effectiveness of\nmeasures taken to address RR&A issues.\n\n3\n\nSee also the lesson learned in Section 4.11 for more benefits of test flights.\nNB: Risk management systems quickly degrade to \xe2\x80\x9cissues-tracking\xe2\x80\x9d unless adequate reserves are\nmaintained to address and retire risks at the appropriate time. Lacking this, risks become accepted de\nfacto.\n4\n\nVol. I Executive Summary\n\nPage 18\n\nConstellation Program\n4.8\n\nLessons Learned Volume I\n\nDecision Making \xe2\x80\x94 Only as Efficient as Roles, Responsibilities, and\nAuthorities are Clear and Understood\n\nDriving Events\nThe clarity and effectiveness of the decision-making processes for the Constellation Program\nwere driven by the same events as summarized in Section 4.7 and described in more detail in\nSection 2.2.\nThe start-up phasing (late start of the program relative to the projects) previously described also\nconfounded decision making. Projects made unilateral changes without considering integrated\neffects. For example, Ares made changes to the \xe2\x80\x9cstack height\xe2\x80\x9d that impacted the Orion and\nGround Operations designs; Orion, without understanding the integrated effects, deleted a test\nflight that was found unnecessary. Once the program integration function was operational,\ndecisions were better coordinated, but opportunities for early-phase, lower-cost changes were\nlost.\nThe mature decision-making structure affecting Constellation Program decisions is partially\nillustrated in Fig. 4. Not shown are other organizations that have a significant influence on\ndecisions: the center institutional processes (e.g., Engineering Review Boards, Program\nManagement Councils, Facility boards), the Technical Authority (which provides the appeals\nroute for technical decisions), and the internal decision processes for the prime contractors.\nLessons Learned\nDespite constant attention from senior management, the decision-making process remained a\npersistent issue that only marginally improved over time. In a program of this scope, attempts to\nbalance timely decision making at the appropriate levels, consider strategic and tactical\nviewpoints, and clearly delineate accountability for execution while keeping all stakeholders\ninformed and included often left someone dissatisfied. The need to maintain the multi-decadal\nfocus was sometimes misunderstood, particularly in projects with immediate, near-term needs.\nThe need to make decisions regarding NASA center infrastructure that would or would not\nsupport Constellation over time was particularly nettlesome, bringing in communities that\nseldom dealt with program management. These decisions typically necessitated involvement at\nthe Agency level and required extra time and staffing. Major infrastructure changes drew\ninterest and attention from Congress as well, so it was necessary for many entities outside the\nprogram to be well informed.\n\nVol. I Executive Summary\n\nPage 19\n\nConstellation Program\n\nLessons Learned Volume I\n\nFig. 4: Illustration of the Constellation Program decision-making board and panel structure.

Invest the time and energy to define a\ncomprehensive decision-making process that includes all affected parties (Technical Authority,\ncenter management, and contractors). Impediments will arise by not anticipating key\nstakeholder interests.\nAttention to the effects of project phasing, particularly for decisions intended to last decades or\naffect center infrastructure, is very important.\n\nVol. I Executive Summary\n\nPage 20\n\nConstellation Program\n4.9\n\nLessons Learned Volume I\n\nOrganization Is Organic \xe2\x80\x94 You\xe2\x80\x99ll Never Get It Right, But You Can Make It\nBetter\n\nDriving Events\nThe organizational structure for the Constellation Program evolved over time. Initially the\norganization was set up in a model derived from the Apollo Program \xe2\x80\x94 an integration function\ncomprised of Systems Engineering and Integration (SE&I), Test and Evaluation (T&E),\nOperations, Program Planning and Control, and Safety, Reliability, and Quality Assurance\n(SR&QA), 5 along with the individual projects including Ares, Orion, Ground Operations, Mission\nOperations, and EVA. An Advanced Projects Office was also included to begin formulation of\nthe lunar projects, including the lander and surface systems. Significant changes within the next\nyear included the following:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nEstablishment of mission managers for the Ares I-X and I-Y flight tests to enable the\nfocus needed for integration\nEstablishment of the Lunar Lander Project (Altair) and the Lunar Surface Systems\nProject, and dissolution of the Advanced Projects Office in response to the completion of\nearly formulation activities for these projects, and no immediate need for succeeding\nearly formulation activities beyond the lunar missions\n\nIn the following year, other organizational refinements were implemented:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nCombination of the Test & Evaluation Office with SE&I, since the T&E role had become\nentangled with that of SE&I and the Ares I-X and I-Y mission managers\nEstablishment of the Program Architect to balance the maturation of the Constellation\narchitecture (LC) with the near-term (IC) systems development.\n\nIn the subsequent year, further organizational refinements were implemented:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nSE&I was reorganized to transform its focus from requirements definition to design\nintegration following completion of the program SDR.\nThe Information Systems Office was formed in response to the focus needed in\ndevelopment and implementation of a program-wide data architecture.\n\nThe preceding listing is illustrative rather than comprehensive to communicate that the program\nadapted the organization over time to both emergent issues and task completion.\nLessons Learned\nOrganizations should be treated as organic entities, evolving and adapting to circumstances\nover time. Needed adaptation can be anticipated according to schedule milestones; the work\nforce and organization should be focussed on achieving the next key milestone, not continuing\nto operate in the mode that achieved the last key milestone. Key milestones such as design\n5\n\nSee Appendix A for further discussion of the organizational structure based on the Apollo Program.\n\nVol. I Executive Summary\n\nPage 21\n\nConstellation Program\n\nLessons Learned Volume I\n\nreviews mark natural breakpoints in organizational strategies and, indeed, the organizational\nscheme warrants assessment as part of a key milestone review. Consider that as the\nConstellation Program moved from requirements definition to development the needed changes\nwere not uniformly recognized, so the organization was slow to adapt after the Systems\nDefinition Review (SDR) to prepare for the PDR. Rather than preemptively assessing the\norganizational model, the program leadership reacted to issues associated with progressing to\nthe PDR as they emerged. The post-PDR organizational adaptation to CDR objectives was\naccomplished more quickly since it was anticipated.\nRecommendation\nRevisit the organization at key milestone reviews to address the changing nature of the work\nahead to achieve the next milestone. This should be documented in a revision of the Program\nPlan and be briefed to senior Agency management at the appropriate milestone briefing. Senior\nAgency management must be enlisted to mitigate social impacts across NASA centers due to\nthe ebb and flow of assigned work.\n\n4.10 Communication Among a Far-flung Team \xe2\x80\x94 Interpersonal Networks and\nInformation Technology Applications Can Improve Bandwidth\nDriving Events\nAs discussed in Section 2.2, Constellation\xe2\x80\x99s widespread 10-center team created a true\ncommunications challenge. While countless assessments and prevailing programmatic wisdom\nindicate that a small, centrally located team is the most efficient way to build a complex element,\nConstellation did not have that luxury. This posed many RR&A and decision-making issues, as\ndescribed above (Sections 4.7, 4.8, and 4.9) as well as integration challenges. Well-understood\nRR&A and clear decision-making processes reduce the communication \xe2\x80\x9coverhead\xe2\x80\x9d for the\nprogram team. Beyond that, any and all efforts to improve communications are beneficial.\nConstellation used the following to enhance communication over and above holding regular\nface-to-face meetings:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nA council of project and program deputies, mentioned in Section 4.7, was formed to\nresolve issues related to roles, decision making, and communications. The council was\nformed in early 2007 to tackle issues already apparent in RR&A associated with the\nformation of the Program Office. This council became an informal communication\nnetwork; members spent time with each other and gained trust by sharing perspectives\nand working through problems of mutual interest.\n\xe2\x80\x9cCommunities of Practice\xe2\x80\x9d were formed to foster discussions in particular technical areas\nand aid information flow.\nIT tools and applications (telecon, WebEx [Cisco, San Jose, CA], LifeSize\xc2\xae [LifeSize\xc2\xae\nCommunications, Inc., Austin, TX], ICE/Windchill, etc.) were all extensively used to\nenhance the flow of information.\n\nVol. I Executive Summary\n\nPage 22\n\nConstellation Program\n\nLessons Learned Volume I\n\nLessons Learned\nThis thorny issue was a classic case of \xe2\x80\x9cthe devil is in the details.\xe2\x80\x9d RR&As were clear enough\noverall, as everyone understood the integrating responsibility of the Program Office with respect\nto the constituent projects; however, translation of this overall understanding into day-to-day\npractice was needed to address the real issues that cropped up daily.\nAs such, frequent meetings of the council of deputies were necessary, which gave the informal\nnetwork an ideal opportunity to form. IT tools including telecon and WebEx allowed many virtual\nmeetings to be interspersed with the face-to-face meetings, greatly increasing productivity of the\ngroup. Over time, as the relationships between group members grew stronger and the team\xe2\x80\x99s\nnorms of behavior became more ingrained in the team members, more and more of the group\xe2\x80\x99s\nwork could be accomplished via these virtual meetings, further increasing productivity.\nThe council of deputies is but one example; the integration groups for each of various\nengineering disciplines also benefitted from improved IT collaboration tools over the previous\ngeneration, allowing significant improvements in the utility of virtual team meetings.\nRecommendation\nLarge-scope, geographically dispersed programs can benefit from interpersonal networks\nestablished across organizational boundaries.\nAffordable, state-of-the-art IT tools can facilitate communications across time and space. They\nshould be available as early and as broadly as feasible.\nA large program should be diligent in anticipating the formal and informal networks that will\nemerge or intentionally be formed, and ensure that these networks have access to the IT tools\nthat will enable them to work most productively.\n\n4.11 Flight Tests \xe2\x80\x94 Learning by Doing\nDriving Events\nThe value of flight tests in program development is undisputed; however, they are inherently\nresource intensive \xe2\x80\x94 that is to say, expensive. As such, they are typically reserved as risk\nmitigation for significant technical risks and demonstrations of critical capabilities. For the\nConstellation Program IC, flight tests were primarily focussed in two primary areas: Ares launch\nvehicle ascent performance and Orion LAS performance.\nThe Ares I-X was the first test flight in a planned series that would culminate in human rating of\nthe vehicle. It was designed as a crewless development flight test to demonstrate the first-stage\nascent performance. Ares I-X successfully flew in October 2009, achieving all test objectives.\nOne of the primary purposes of Ares I-X was to acquire flight data early enough to influence and\nimpact the design and development of the Ares I. The Ares I-X attributes were sufficiently\nsimilar to the Ares I to meet the test flight objectives. The test provided enough data for partial\n\nVol. I Executive Summary\n\nPage 23\n\nConstellation Program\n\nLessons Learned Volume I\n\nvalidation of models and processes used in the Ares I design, and allowed the test data to\nimprove Ares I design and development.\nA series of flight tests was planned for the Orion LAS to certify safety and performance in the\nmost challenging launch and flight regimes. The first flight test (Pad Abort-1) demonstrated LAS\nperformance and crew module landing systems performance in a pad abort scenario. Pad\nAbort-1, which was launched in May 2010, was the second Constellation flight test and\nachieved all flight test objectives. A primary purpose of this launch, which was akin to that of\nAres I-X, was to acquire flight data early enough to influence and impact the design and\ndevelopment of the Orion LAS and crew module landing and recovery systems. The test\nprovided enough data for partial validation of models and processes used in the Orion design,\nimproving Orion design and development.\nThe Ares I-X and Pad Abort-1 efforts were largely independent activities. As such, comparing\nthe two flight test activities reveals fundamental similarities that may characterize successful\nflight tests and provide insight for future program success.\nLessons Learned\nBoth flight tests were very successful, achieving all flight test objectives and returning a wealth\nof technical data early enough in the development cycle to inform design; however, the key\nlessons learned involve the nontechnical returns from the flight tests. In both cases, these\ncomplex flight tests stressed the needed organizational constructs and drove clarity into RR&A\nand the decision-making structures. Had these issues been revealed later and addressed\nnearer to first full-system flight (e.g., the planned Orion-1 mission), significant delays and an\nincreased risk posture would have resulted.\nFurthermore, nontraditional approaches can be tried during a flight test, particularly a crewless\nflight test. For instance, Ares I-X used a \xe2\x80\x9cping-test\xe2\x80\x9d approach to determine the structural\ncharacteristics of the stack rather than a much more expensive and time-consuming structural\nground test. This approach worked very well and, after its successful demonstration on Ares I-X,\nthe program was examining the cost savings vs. risk of adopting this approach for future flights.\nFinally, it is noteworthy that when the program was cancelled, it was in the process of revising\nthe development strategy for the IC to rely more heavily on flight tests, saving time and budget\nby reducing ground tests in response to the increased confidence in the analytical models and\nsimulations that resulted from the Ares I-X and Pad Abort-1 flight tests.\nRecommendation\nPlan a series of flight tests to demonstrate key system capabilities and mitigate major technical\nrisks. Ensure that some of the flight tests occur early enough in the development cycle (i.e.,\nPDR time frame) to return data in time to inform the system design. Flight tests have the\nadditional benefit of providing opportunities to test alternative approaches and discover\nefficiencies for overall organizational performance.\n\nVol. I Executive Summary\n\nPage 24\n\nConstellation Program\n\nLessons Learned Volume I\n\n5.0 DEVELOPMENT PROCESS, KNOWLEDGE CAPTURE,\nAND CONTRIBUTORS\nThe entire Constellation Program team contributed to these lessons learned, in both the content\nof this Volume I Executive Summary and the content of Volume II. The knowledge capture\nprocess is described in Volume II.\nAn executive review committee assisted in synthesizing the lessons learned. This committee\nwas comprised of: Bob Ess (Ares I-X Mission Manager), Jeff Hanley (Constellation Program\nManager 2005-2010), Deb Neubek (Constellation Chief of Staff\xe2\x80\x94Technical), Charlie\nStegemoeller (Constellation Deputy Program Manager and former Program, Planning, and\nControl Director), Dale Thomas (Constellation Program Manager and former Deputy\nConstellation Program Manager), and Teresa Vanhooser (Ares Project Manager, Ares\nProjects). A full list of contributors to Volume II appears in that volume.\nDale Thomas, Deb Neubek, and Jennifer Rhatigan synthesized and structured these\ncontributions into the Lessons Learned documents (Vol. I and Vol. II).\nThe program and its projects conducted knowledge-capture activities throughout its duration.\nThese included many Lean Six Sigma events, a multitude of technical reports, conference\npapers, and final lessons learned activities. All formal program documents, reports, review\nmaterials, lessons learned reports, etc., will be both archived with the National Archives and\nRecords Administration and made available in the ESMD ICE system. 6 Those lessons learned\nthat are deemed as key risks are being fully documented, via text and video interviews, as\nknowledge-based risks. In addition, hundreds of lessons learned are being entered into the\nNASA Engineering Network\xe2\x80\x99s Lessons Learned Database. The ICE system will include a\nConstellation Program Knowledge Management wiki page that will link to the various topics to\nmake finding all of these materials easier.\nCurrent URLs [uniform resource locators] for these resources are below:\nExploration Systems Risk and Knowledge Management Portal:\nhttps://ice.exploration.nasa.gov/ice/site/km\nNASA Engineering Network (Click on the Lessons Learned Tab):\nhttps://nen.nasa.gov/web/nen\nPublic NASA Engineering Network Lessons Learned:\nhttp://llis.nasa.gov/llis/search/home.jsp\n\n6\n\nIn researching lessons learned from previous programs, primarily Apollo and space shuttle, a number of\nkey documents were scanned into electronic form for wide distribution within the program and archived in\nthe Constellation database.

The Constellation Program\xe2\x80\x99s heritage rests on the successes and lessons learned from\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s previous human spaceflight programs: Mercury, Gemini, Apollo, Space Shuttle and\nInternational Space Station (ISS). This paper describes the rationale behind the formulation of the\nConstellation Program, including organizational structure, and workforce structure, as well as the\napproaches to requirements generation, budget formulation, operational philosophies, and\nprocurement strategies.\nINTRODUCTION\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s human spaceflight history of\nprogram formulation, development and\noperations was a primary resource in the\nformulation of the Constellation Program.\nWe researched historical records from the\nApollo Program, and its predecessors\nGemini and Mercury, as well as the more\nrecent Space Shuttle and ISS Programs.\nMost importantly, consultation not only with\nhistories, but also with individual managers\ninvolved in key decision making in past\nprograms, formed the basis of the structure\nof\ntoday\xe2\x80\x99s\nConstellation\nProgram.\nMoreover, much of the Constellation\nhardware traces its history to previous\nprograms and that corporate history and\nexisting management structure have been\nleveraged to a great extent. This paper\nsummarizes the rationale for the Program\nstructure. We note that current technical\ndescriptions of the program content may be\nfound elsewhere.1\n\nFollowing the loss of Columbia, NASA\nestablished\nthe\nColumbia\nAccident\nInvestigation Board (CAIB) to perform an\nin-depth review of the Space Shuttle\nProgram. As a result of this review, the\nCAIB concluded that it was in the best\ninterest of the U.S. to develop a replacement\nfor the Space Shuttle. The CAIB concluded\nthat it should be possible using past and\nfuture investments in technology to develop\nthe basis for a system, \xe2\x80\x9csignificantly\nimproved over one designed 40 years\nearlier, for carrying humans to orbit and\nenabling their work in space\xe2\x80\x9d2.\nIn January 2004, The White House issued a\nnew exploration initiative3 to return humans\nto the Moon by 2020 in preparation for\nhuman exploration of Mars and beyond. As\npart of this initiative, NASA will continue to\nuse the Space Shuttle to fulfill its obligation\nto complete assembly of the International\nSpace Station (ISS) and then retire the Space\n\nVol. I Executive Summary\n\nPage 27\n\nConstellation Program\nShuttle by 2010. NASA will also build and\nfly a new Crew Exploration Vehicle (since\nnamed Orion) by 2014. In 2005, Congress\nexpressly\nendorsed\nthe\nPresident\xe2\x80\x99s\nexploration\ninitiative\nand\nprovided\nadditional direction4, authorizing NASA to\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\xa6establish a program to develop a\nsustained human presence on the moon,\nincluding a robust precursor program to\npromote exploration, science, commerce and\nU.S. preeminence in space, and as a stepping\nstone to future exploration of Mars and other\ndestinations.\xe2\x80\x9d\nIn response to the Presidential direction, the\nAgency formed the Exploration Systems\nMission Directorate (ESMD) at NASA\nHeadquarters\nin\n2004\nto\noversee\ndevelopment of exploration programs. The\nConstellation Systems Division was initiated\nto oversee the human exploration mission\ndevelopment.\nIn May 2005, NASA Administrator Michael\nGriffin commissioned the Exploration\nSystems Architecture Study (ESAS), a sixtyday study to perform the tasks of defining\nthe\ntop-level\nrequirements\nand\nconfigurations for crew and cargo launch\nsystems to support exploration objectives.\nThe study concluded that the launch vehicles\nshould\nbe\nderived\nfrom\nexisting\ntechnologies, leveraging the lessons learned\nfrom past programs.\nThe ESAS\nrecommended an architecture which\nincluded a Crew Launch Vehicle (since\nnamed Ares I) to ferry crew and cargo to the\nISS and to carry crew to Earth orbit. A\nheavy-lift Cargo Launch Vehicle (since\nnamed Ares V), to support missions to the\nMoon and Mars was also defined.5 The\nresulting architecture formed the basis of the\nConstellation Program.\nIn August that year, the NASA\nAdministrator\nformed\nthe\nESAS\nRequirements Transition Team (ERTT)\ncharging them to complete an architecturelevel specification that defined the elements\nand their top level functionality; and to\ncomplete a draft of the Crew Exploration\nVehicle System Requirements Document,\nvalidating its consistency with the\narchitecture and providing the basis for\nVol. I Executive Summary\n\nLessons Learned Volume I\nsubsequent prime contractor selection. It is\nalso notable that the ERTT was asked to\nlead the first of many internal NASA\ncultural changes, including the adoption of a\n\xe2\x80\x98zero-based\xe2\x80\x99 requirements philosophy, in\nwhich only the minimum necessary and\ncost-effective requirements are included.\nCONTEXTUAL DIRECTION\nNo modern program is created from whole\ncloth, and the Constellation Program is no\nexception. We note here the major themes,\nforces, situations, guidelines, constraints and\nenvironmental considerations underway at\nthe time of the Constellation Program\nformulation. These are provided for\ncontextual understanding of the Agency\nexpectations of the Program.\nContinue Human Spaceflight\nThe Agency\xe2\x80\x99s primary objectives are\ncontinued safe operations of the Space\nShuttle and completion of the ISS. The\nhuman space flight work-force within the\nAgency is engaged in continuous operations\nin support of those objectives.\nTransition the Space Shuttle\nWith the retirement of the Space Shuttle\nplanned for 2010, the Constellation Program\nshould plan to utilize the Space Shuttle\nworkforce, hardware and infrastructure that\nsupport the Constellation mission, in a\nmanner that enables a smooth transition\nfrom one to the next, but does not interfere\nwith on-going operations.\nPlan for Level Budgets\nThe Constellation Program should expect\nthe Agency\xe2\x80\x99s allocation of the Federal\nbudget to remain at levels consistent with\nthe current environment. No increases other\nthan modest cost-of-living increases should\nbe expected, thus the Constellation Program\ndevelopment is constrained by completion\nof the Space Shuttle Program.\nLead an Agency-wide Team\nThe Constellation Program should leverage\nexpertise across the Agency where possible,\nPage 28\n\nConstellation Program\nin keeping with Agency objectives to\nmaintain all 10 NASA Centers in healthy\nposture. Indeed, the Program should\ntransform the 10 NASA Centers into a\nunified agency-wide team.\nAs the Crew Exploration Vehicle and the\nCrew Launch Vehicle organizations were\npreviously formed in the Fall of 2005, the\nConstellation Program should establish a\nstrong program to lead the integration of\nthese established organizations.\nLead Culture Change\nThe Space Shuttle and ISS Programs were\ndeveloped in the context of their times,\nfacing challenges and unknowns that\nhumble us in appreciation of the efforts it\ntook to make them successful. There is an\ninherent legacy to efforts of that magnitude;\nsome appropriate for direct adaptation by a\nnew program, some not. The Agency\nleadership has given the Program license to\nexplore new methods and approaches to\ndeveloping and procuring future human\nspace flight and ground systems. We\xe2\x80\x99ve\nalso been charged with using the\nConstellation Program to do nothing less\nthan reconstitute systems engineering\ncapacity within NASA\xe2\x80\x99s human spaceflight\ncommunity, to smoothly transition the\nhuman spaceflight workforce to the next\ngeneration of capabilities and to lay the\nfoundation of a program that will be costeffective and sustainable into the far future.\nWhile remaining attentive to the lessons\nlearned from current and prior programs,\nConstellation Program should lead the\nAgency in cultural changes\xe2\x80\x94to re-invent\nhow human spaceflight development is\ndone.\nMeet Commitments\nThe Constellation Program should meet its\ncommitments; that is, do what we said we\nwould do, when we said we would do it\nwithin the allocated budget, schedule, and\ntechnical requirements. If the budget is cut,\nlet stakeholders know the impact to our\nschedule and/or technical commitments. The\npractice of maintaining unrealistic schedules\n\nVol. I Executive Summary\n\nLessons Learned Volume I\nin the face of budget cuts should not be\ncontinued.\nImprove Spaceflight Risk\nAchieve\nan\norder-of-magnitude\nimprovement in risk to crew and mission\nover that of the Space Shuttle. Current\nprobabilistic risk assessment puts the risk of\nloss of crew for the Space Shuttle on the\norder 10-2. Constellation should improve\nthis to the order of 10-3.\nSimplify Operations\nThe Constellation Program should plan and\nrequire simplified operations such that\noperational costs are minimized, particularly\nwith respect to Space Shuttle heritage\noperations. New developments for lunar\nand Martian expeditions are only possible if\nbudget is made available due to decreased\noperational costs. Thus Constellation will\nonly be sustainable if the operational\ninfrastructure and workforce are more\nefficient than today.\nRecognizing the need to establish a program\noffice co-located with the NASA program\nexperience base, ESMD established the\nConstellation Program at the NASA Johnson\nSpace Center in November of 2005. The\nfollowing sections describe the decisions\nthat were made in its formulation in the\ncontext of the guidelines discussed above.\nORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE\nConstellation Program\nThe structural model that most closely\nresembles the current mission is the Apollo\n\xe2\x80\x9c5-box\xe2\x80\x9d management structure6 and was\nselected because it worked effectively.\nThese five organizational functions are\ncomprised of program planning and control;\ntest and verification; operations integration;\nsystems engineering and integration; and\nsafety, reliability and quality assurance. This\nwas adapted and tailored to the Constellation\nProgram\xe2\x80\x99s more evolutionary objectives.\nConstellation is envisioned to have\ndevelopmental aspects throughout its life\ncycle in that new developments to support\nPage 29\n\nConstellation Program\nthe next mission will start in phases as\ncurrent developments become operational.\nFor instance, lunar outpost development will\nstart after the low Earth orbit portions of the\nprogram are operational.\nThe adapted\norganizational structure is shown in Figure\n1. Note that an advanced development\nfunction (Advanced Projects Office) has\nbeen added to the Apollo \xe2\x80\x9c5-box\xe2\x80\x9d structure.\nThis organization houses research and\ndevelopment activities for \xe2\x80\x98pre-projects\xe2\x80\x99\nenvisioned to support lunar missions and\nbeyond. Organizations outside of NASA,\nsuch as international partners and\ncommercial partners, could be involved in\nthese later phases of the Program7.\n\nLessons Learned Volume I\nThe program was staffed with recognized\nleadership within the Agency (e.g., from the\nISS Program, Space Shuttle Program, and\nMission Operations Flight Director Office)\nand the contractor/DoD space community\nbetween November 2005 and March 2006,\nseeking\nproject\nmanagers\nwith\ndemonstrated experience in executing\nprojects and discipline-area leaders able to\nassemble strong teams, articulate a clear\nvision of the task, and integrate horizontally\nand vertically.\n\nFigure 1: Constellation Organization Structure.

All recognized the importance of\nhaving a program office integrate project\ninterfaces, as well as the importance of\nallowing projects maximum flexibility in\nmanaging their assigned element. However,\na detailed examination of integration\nprocesses was necessary to truly understand\nConstellation\nProject\n\nLead\nNASA\nCenter\n\nand assign responsibilities.

The Office of the\nChief Engineer (OCE), the Office of Safety\nand Mission Assurance (OSMA), and the\nOffice of the Chief Health and Medical\nOfficer (OCHMO) have authority over\nengineering; safety, reliability and quality\nassurance; and health and medical standards,\nrespectively.\nThey also have the\nresponsibility to provide informed technical\nrecommendations on programmatic issues\nthroughout all stages of a program life cycle.\nIn addition, they provide an appeal path for\nprogram office\npersonnel\nor\nline\norganization personnel who disagree with a\nprogram decision. NASA and industry\nstandards, ranging from human rating\nstandards to conformance to the metric\nsystem, are owned by the technical\nauthorities. However, not all requirements\nin these documents are applicable or\nappropriate for the Constellation Program.\nIt is the Program\xe2\x80\x99s responsibility, with the\nassistance of the technical authorities, to\ndevelop and recommend a tailored set of\nthese requirements. It is the technical\nauthorities\xe2\x80\x99 responsibility to review and\napprove the tailored set of requirements.\nRisk acceptance is the Program Manager\xe2\x80\x99s\nresponsibility, including the acceptance of\nresidual safety risks that result from ground\nor flight anomalies, hazard analyses and\nFMEA/CILs \xe2\x80\xa1\xe2\x80\xa1.\nHowever, the technical\nauthority may appeal if they determine that a\nrisk is unacceptable for flight.\nDecision Making Structure\nThe Constellation Program uses a\nboard/panel structure for making decisions\nthat affect the baseline, as well as for\nmaking technical implementation decisions\nat a program level. An example of the\ndecisions that affect the baseline would be\nanything that requires a change to a Program\napproved document. An example of a\ntechnical implementation decision would be\n\nLessons Learned Volume I\nwhether to approve a design modification\nrequiring\nadditional\nfunding.\nThe\nConstellation Control Board is chaired by\nthe program manager; membership includes\neach project and program office appearing in\nFigure 1.\nIn order to implement the Governance\nModel, the technical authorities are also\nboard members on the Constellation Control\nBoard.\nThis\navoids\nthe\n\xe2\x80\x98shadow\norganization\xe2\x80\x99 that has evolved in past\nprograms. These representatives cannot be\nprogram office personnel, nor can they be\nfunded by the program. In this board\nstructure, program office personnel (SE&I,\nProgram SR&Q, etc.) are responsible for\nproviding a recommendation to the Program\nManager for their functional area. It is the\nresponsibility of every board member,\nwhether within the program or part of the\ntechnical authority, to ensure that the board\nis aware of dissenting opinions, that they are\ndiscussed, and that the dissenter is advised\nof the disposition. If an individual or\nindividuals disagree with a Program\nManager or Technical Authority decision,\nand believe that the decision poses a risk to\nsafety or mission success, there is an\nestablished appeal path.\nWORKFORCE\nAs noted in the Background section, the\nConstellation Program has been formulated,\nand must execute, during continuous\noperations of the Space Shuttle (through\n2010) and ISS. Moreover, we must be\nprepared to make best use of the expertise\nresident in the Space Shuttle workforce,\nwhen it becomes available as that program\nphases out. Constellation has developed a\nphased development program in anticipation\nof this workforce availability. This phased\napproach is described in more detail in the\nSchedule section of this paper.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa1\xe2\x80\xa1 FEMA=failure modes and effects analysis;\nCIL=critical items list\n\nVol. I \xe2\x80\x93 Executive Summary\n\nPage 32\n\nConstellation Program\n\nLessons Learned Volume I\nwas sufficient experience in the office to\nattempt a reduction in the budget to only\n~ 6.5% of the total program content.

This contract provides a simple\npathway to enlist the aid of retired experts\nfrom NASA\xe2\x80\x99s past (e.g., George Mueller,\nChris Kraft, Glynn Lunney, etc).\nBeyond review and advice, SAGES was\ncreated to transfer knowledge through\nmentoring. It is based on relationships\nbetween Apollo and Shuttle-era program\nmanagers and discipline experts, and the\nConstellation team. SAGES provides\nmentors on an as-needed, targeted basis in\nareas ranging from technical design and\nanalysis disciplines, to ground and flight\noperations, to program management. Twenty\nfour tasks have been initiated to date,\nincluding margins management; relationship\nbetween Level II program office and the\nLevel III project office responsibilities;\nlunar lander requirements; test and\nverification planning; and launch abort\ndesign and operations.\nREQUIREMENTS\nThe ESAS team had developed an\nExploration Architecture specification and\ndraft system requirements documents\n(SRDs) for both the CEV (Orion) and the\nAres I (CLV). In lieu of an established\nProgram office, the follow-on ERTT\nformulated, as its primary task, a\nrequirement set consistent with the\narchitecture defined by the ESAS team and a\nCEV SRD sufficient to support a downselect of CEV contractors in 2006 as part of\nthe Call for Improvement (CFI) process.\nThus initial requirements for the basic\narchitecture, Orion, and Ares I were\nestablished at the time the Constellation\nProgram office began work. The Program\nteam had to quickly establish processes,\nroles,\nresponsibilities,\nand\nteam\norganizational structure to align an\nintegrated set of requirements that would\nunite the elements together into a strong\nprogram that could integrate and execute\nmissions.\n\nVol. I \xe2\x80\x93 Executive Summary\n\nLessons Learned Volume I\nZero-Based Requirements Approach\nRequirements development was the linchpin\nfor concurrent maturation of program cost\nand schedule. A zero-based requirements\nphilosophy has been adopted in which only\nthe\nnecessary\nand\ncost-effective\nrequirements are included. Projects are\ndirected\nto\n\xe2\x80\x9cdrive-out\xe2\x80\x9d\nunnecessary\nrequirements, write requirements in terms of\noutcomes and not solutions or \xe2\x80\x9chow-to\xe2\x80\x9d and\ndrive out non-value-added steps in achieving\noutcomes. This approach is requisite for all\ncontracts and \xe2\x80\x98in-house\xe2\x80\x99 work. The need for\ndata\ndeliverables,\nreviews\nand\napplicable/reference documents is carefully\nscrutinized in order to be sure that these\nrequirements are necessary, value-added and\ncost-effective and are required to achieve the\ndesired outcome of a project. This will be a\ncontinual process not only in the pre-award\nphase, but also in the post-award\nadministration of contracts.\nEvolving the Architecture\nWith an integrated program team under\ndevelopment,\nseveral\nsignificant\nimprovements to the architecture outlined by\nthe 60-day ESAS team became apparent\nthrough trade-study and risk analyses. The\nProgram base-lined the Apollo-heritage J2X engine as the primary upper stage engine\nfor both the Ares I and Ares V\nconfigurations. A cluster of five RS-68\nengines (common with the Delta IV) was\nselected as the baseline first stage engine\nconfiguration for the Ares V. And the first\nstage solid rocket booster configuration was\nlengthened to include 5 segments (rather\nthan 4) for both the Ares I and Ares V\nconfigurations. Architecture requirements\nwere also established for the EVA suit\nsystems, ground operations and mission\noperations8.\nProgram Requirements Reviews\nThe Program embarked on a season of\nSystem Requirements Reviews (SRRs),\ncommencing with a Program SRR in the\nFall of 2006, progressing through project\nSRRs, and culminating in Program baseline\nsynchronization in May 2007. The SRR is\n\nPage 34\n\nConstellation Program\nconducted to ensure that the program\nrequirements are properly formulated and\ncorrelated with the Agency and ESMD\nstrategic objectives. Specifically, the SRR\nassures that: the high-level program\nrequirements are complete and approved, the\ninterfaces with other programs are approved,\nthe program requirements are cost-effective,\nthe program requirements are decomposed\nand adequately levied on projects, the plan\nfor controlling changes to program\nrequirements is approved, the approach for\nverification of requirements is approved, and\nmitigation strategies for addressing major\nrisks are approved. After project SRRs, the\nprogram baseline synchronization was\nconducted to resolve discontinuities\nidentified among project requirements and\nbetween project and program requirements.\nIn January of 2007, Constellation gathered\nApollo and Shuttle veterans (via the SAGES\ncontract mentioned earlier) in a \xe2\x80\x9cgreybeard\xe2\x80\x9d\nreview of the program baseline to seek\nadvice and management guidance through\nthe early phase of the program. This advice\nis currently being integrated into the\nprogram, particularly in our approach\ntowards risk management. We intend to\ncontinue involvement of our spaceflight\nveterans as we move forward towards\nprogram implementation.\nProjects are beginning System Definition\nReviews (SDRs) at this writing, to ensure\nthe readiness of the program for making a\nprogram commitment agreement (PCA) to\napprove project formulation startups and\nmove into the program implementation\nphase.\nSafety, Reliability and Quality Assurance\n(SR&QA) Requirements\nIt is the goal of the Constellation Program to\nachieve an order-of-magnitude improvement\nin risk to crew and mission over that of the\nSpace Shuttle. Some of this improvement\ncan\nbe\nachieved\nthrough\ndesign\nimprovements. The Ares I/Orion system is\nestimated to be much more reliable for the\ncrew than the Space Shuttle, primarily due\nto its in-line design and incorporation of the\nLaunch Abort System for crew escape.\n\nVol. I \xe2\x80\x93 Executive Summary\n\nLessons Learned Volume I\nOther improvements must focus upon\nchanging the way we \xe2\x80\x98do\xe2\x80\x99 SR&QA. This\ncenters around: the early identification of\nrequirements driving safety and mission\nsuccess, the performance of safety and\nmission success analyses throughout the life\ncycle, but early enough to influence design\nand operations, and an assurance framework\nthat verifies that the system is designed,\nbuilt and operated in accordance with\nrequirements.\nSCHEDULE\nThe primary schedule requirements for the\nConstellation Program are to develop the\nCEV (Orion) to transport humans to and\nfrom ISS by 2014 \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7, and to return humans to\nthe Moon by 2020. These two goals lead to a\nphased schedule approach, illustrated in\nFigure 3 (through 2011). Figure 3 shows two\nprimary elements of schedule execution:\nInitial Capability (IC) development and\nLunar Capability (LC) development. The IC\nincludes the elements necessary to deploy\nthe CEV/CLV (Orion/Ares I) configuration\nthat will support ISS, including the ground\nand mission operations capabilities and the\nspacesuits (EVA systems) needed for the\ncrew. The LC includes the Cargo Launch\nVehicle (Ares V), the Lunar Lander and the\nLunar Surface Systems (e.g. rovers, habitats,\nscientific equipment). The current focus of\nthe Program is development of lunar capable\nelements that support the ISS. Many of the\nelements of the IC now under development\nare accelerating the LC. For example, the\nJ2-X engine is the primary engine on the\nupper stage of both the Ares I and Ares V\nvehicles. This aggressive development for\nthe Ares I will provide higher confidence\nduring the Ares V vehicle development.

The Orion design incorporates a\nLaunch Abort System (LAS) that would pull the\nCrew Module to a safe landing if necessary in\nthe event of an abort during launch and early\nphases of ascent to orbit. While this system is\nbased on Apollo heritage, it must be thoroughly\ntested prior to utilization with a crew on board.\nA series of flight tests of the LAS is planned for\nthe White Sands Missile Range (WSMR) that\nwill include both pad abort and ascent abort\ntests. In 2009, Ares I-X--the first developmental\nflight test of the \xe2\x80\x98integrated stack\xe2\x80\x99--will be\nlaunched from the Kennedy Space Center\n(KSC). Ares I-X will test the integration and\nperformance of a simulated Ares/Orion \xe2\x80\x98stack\xe2\x80\x99\nprior to Critical Design Review (CDR) so that\nresulting design changes could be incorporated\nbefore production of flight articles. Further flight\ntesting at KSC is planned into the next decade.\nBUDGET AND ACQUISITION\nBudget Development\nThe ESAS team had assembled a preliminary\nbudget estimate for execution of the\nrecommended architecture. In the spring of\n2006, the Constellation Program developed an\nunconstrained \xe2\x80\x9cbottoms-up\xe2\x80\x9d budget estimate for\nthe purposes of establishing a \xe2\x80\x9cfirst cut\xe2\x80\x9d\nunderstanding of the drivers for costs and\nschedule from present to the lunar landing phase\nof the Program. This analysis provided the\nelement break-down and the raw data for\nbuilding a subsequent budget that was\nrealistically constrained by Agency priorities\nand needs. By the summer 2006, the Program\nwas able to establish the first budget baseline\nmeeting Agency schedule commitments of\ndeploying the CEV (Orion) by 2014, and\nlanding on the Moon by 2020.\nThese were updated in the Fall of 2006 as\nprogram requirements matured. Completion of\nthe Program\xe2\x80\x99s System Requirements Review\n(SRR\xe2\x80\x94see Requirements section), provided a\nfurther level of requirements development that\nallowed for more refined estimates in the\nAgency\xe2\x80\x99s FY07 budget development cycle.\n\nVol. I \xe2\x80\x93 Executive Summary\n\nLessons Learned Volume I\nConfidence Level\nThe history of human spaceflight is replete with\nexamples of cost overruns due to confluence of\nunder-funding, insufficient or poorly phased\nreserves, misunderstood risks and complexities,\noverly aggressive schedules, and difficulties\nmeeting ambitious technical requirements. We\nhave no illusions that we will not encounter\nthese challenges; therefore the Constellation\nProgram is pioneering within NASA the\nimplementation of probabilistic techniques to\nassess the confidence level expected that the\nprogram can achieve given schedule milestones\nwithin the budget allocated9. Our guidance\nwithin the Agency is to maintain a confidence\nlevel of 65% that we can meet our schedule\ncommitments within the allocated budget and\ntechnical base-line. Program confidence level is\ncalculated incorporating project-level confidence\nlevels, project-level risks, and program-level\nrisks, along with assumptions on dependencies\namong the risks. The Program conducted\nconfidence level assessments during the budget\ndevelopment process, and plans to refine these\nduring annual budget cycles. This analysis is key\nto assuring that we maintain our commitments to\nour stakeholders and have underpinning\nrationale for dialogue when requirements\nchanges to the baseline are under consideration.\nDuring 2007, the Program was allocated less\nfunding than planned in the Federal\nappropriation bill. Since the Constellation\nProgram proceeds as a \xe2\x80\x98go as you can afford to\npay\xe2\x80\x99 program, this resulted in a 6-month delay in\nour commitment to fielding the first Orion crew\nvehicle and Ares I launch vehicle for Initial\nOperating Capability (IOC). This date is now\nMarch 2015, rather than 201410.\nAcquisition Strategy\nAs plans are made for the retirement of the\nSpace Shuttle, NASA is assessing possible\nsynergies to be gained between the contracts and\nacquisition strategies already in place. The\nIntegrated Acquisition Roadmap Team (IART)\nhas been chartered to map all existing and\nplanned Space Shuttle, ISS and Constellation\ncontracts and to identify opportunities to save\ncosts, including life cycle costs, to utilize lessons\nlearned and best practices, to address transitions\nacross program phases, to maximize the\n\nPage 37\n\nConstellation Program\neffective use of both the existing civil service\nand contractor workforce, and to facilitate\nstrategic competitive opportunities.\nWhere appropriate, the Constellation Program is\nutilizing current, proven technology in order to\nachieve safer, more reliable and affordable\nsolutions. For example, the Ares I and the Ares\nV are based on proven systems from the Space\nShuttle and Apollo Saturn V programs, enabling\nNASA to reduce development costs compared to\ndesigning and building an entirely new launch\nvehicle. This approach maximizes the value of\nexisting facilities, certified parts, production\ntools and expertise. Common propulsion\nelements help reduce operation costs for a more\nsustainable exploration program.\nThe\nConstellation Program has entered into sole\nsource production contracts for heritage- based\nelements; ATK-Thiokol for the Ares I first stage\nand Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne for the J2-X\nengine.\nLockheed-Martin was selected as the prime\ncontractor for the Orion development through\nfull and open competition. The production\ncontract for the Ares I upper stage was recently\nawarded to Boeing through full and open\ncompetition. Further prime contract awards are\nexpected over the coming year.\nThe Constellation Program acquisition strategy\nplaces an emphasis on the criticality of reducing\nand controlling life cycle cost in each acquisition\nphase because NASA plans to produce and fly\nthese vehicles for decades to come.\nUnderstanding and managing life cycle cost is\npivotal to the overall long-term success and\nviability of the program.\nOPERATIONAL PHILOSOPHY\nAs noted in the contextual discussion in the\nBackground section, the cost burden of Space\nShuttle operations cannot be inherited by this\nProgram if the Lunar Capability and the eventual\nMars Capability is to be developed concurrently\nwith Initial Capability operations. It is\ninteresting to note that minimization of lifecycle costs, particularly operational costs, was\nan important objective of the Space Shuttle\nProgram during its development11. This is not to\npoint out folly, but indeed to illustrate how\ndifficult this objective can be even under\n\nVol. I \xe2\x80\x93 Executive Summary\n\nLessons Learned Volume I\nproactive management. We believe that we\nhave the advantage of a much simpler system to\noperate, but are also cognizant that we inherit\noperational processes ingrained over a 30-year\nhistory.\nTo that end, the Program has\nundertaken a number of efforts aimed at life\ncycle cost reductions. Examples are discussed\nbelow:\nStretch Requirements\nThe architecture requirements include \xe2\x80\x98stretch\nrequirements\xe2\x80\x99 defined as those that enable\nground and flight system supportability and\nreductions in operational life cycle costs.\nModeled after the Boeing 777 development,\nstretch requirements specify a desired outcome\nbelieved to simplify operations. For instance, a\n\xe2\x80\x98clean pad\xe2\x80\x99 concept has been specified to\nchallenge designers to minimize services and\ninterfaces required at the launch pad as well as\nlocation/access on the vehicle. Each service or\numbilical (e.g. cooling) attached to the launch\nvehicle is thus challenged for relevance or \xe2\x80\x98must\nhave\xe2\x80\x99 capability. The Ground Operations Project\nand Mission Operations Project are focal to\nmanage the stretch requirements; these are\nincorporated into flight design via negotiation of\nInterface Requirements Documents (IRDs) with\neach of the flight projects (Orion, Ares, EVA,\nand Lander).\n\xe2\x80\x98Con Ops\xe2\x80\x99 Development\nConstellation has developed a Concept of\nOperations (Con Ops) for operation of the\nprogram through its mission phases, in order to\ndrive out operational features that influence\nhardware, software and interface requirements.\nThis is a typical best practice in NASA program\ndevelopment. Design reference missions have\nbeen developed for ISS missions, lunar sortie\nmissions, lunar outpost missions, and a Mars\nmission so that operational design drivers are\nidentified early.\nMoreover, we\xe2\x80\x99ve also initiated similar but\nperhaps unique con ops efforts for targeted\nprocesses that can influence life cycle costs. For\nexample, the current practice of quality\nassurance in the Space Shuttle program is being\nbench-marked for efficiency improvements. By\ndeveloping a con ops for how quality assurance\n\nPage 38\n\nConstellation Program\nis conducted through the life of the program, a\nmore efficient path to quality assurance may be\ndetermined a priori.\nLife Cycle Cost Evaluations\nChange evaluations to the program baseline\nmust include an assessment of the life cycle cost\nimpact of each change to the baseline.\nConstellation procurements--both \xe2\x80\x98end-item\xe2\x80\x99 and\n\xe2\x80\x98award fee\xe2\x80\x99 types--include incentives to reduce\nlife-cycle cost.\nLean Efforts\nLean six-sigma and Kaizen studies were\nconducted on some early developments, such as\nthe Ares 1-X test flight. This has proven\nsuccessful and the Program is seeking further\nopportunities to gain process time reduction and\nsimplification.\nThe \xe2\x80\x98handoff\xe2\x80\x99 between designers and the\nsustaining\nengineering\nand\noperational\ncommunities is being studied for efficiency\nimprovements. Current practice includes\noverlapping responsibilities and designer\ninvolvement in post-design processes. Efforts\nare underway to identify and minimize this to\nultimately reduce costs.\nIndustry Advice\nThe Ground Operations Project conducted\nfeasibility studies under the Broad Area\nAnnouncement capability; requesting novel\nideas from industry on how to streamline\nprocessing, launch and recovery operations. The\nconcepts are intended to produce \xe2\x80\x98cleaner\xe2\x80\x99\ntechniques and processes in the belief that fewer\nanomalies are possible with simpler processes.\nExamples of concepts include new approaches\nto emergency egress system for the crew,\nisolation of the launch pad lightening protection\nsystem, and alternatives to hypergolic fuel\nloading to reduce processing time.\nIf we are truly successful in driving down\noperations costs such that the cost per flight is as\nlow or lower than we project, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve\ndesigned the supremely operable system that can\nbe processed, flown, recovered and refurbished\nwith a minimum of effort, then we\xe2\x80\x99ve opened\nthe door to other acquisition strategies in the\nproduction phase that would not be open to us\n\nVol. I \xe2\x80\x93 Executive Summary\n\nLessons Learned Volume I\nwith a more labor intensive system.\nSpecifically, the option to buy services as a\ncommodity would be available so that we can\nthen devote our expertise to designing the next\nConstellation element in the plan.\nSUMMARY\nAs the long-term objectives of U.S. space\nexploration evolve, the near-term goals remain\nthe same: to develop the flight systems and\nground infrastructure required to enable\ncontinued access to space and to enable future\ncrewed mission to the ISS, the Moon, Mars and\nbeyond.\nThe initial formulation of the program\nrequirements baseline was completed in\nNovember 2006 at the Cx program SRR. The\nprogram is evolving within this structure of\norganization, requirements and funding as its\nfoundation. A major challenge is to stand up an\norganization that draws on the best expertise in\nthe Agency while maintaining primary focus on\nthe currently operational Space Shuttle and ISS\nprograms.\nThe formulation of the Constellation Program is\na robust system, based on the best of NASA\xe2\x80\x99s\nheritage, and designed to evolve as technical and\nprogrammatic needs demand.\nREFERENCES\n1\n\nNASA 2007.

ABSTRACT (Maximum 200 words)\n\nThis document (Volume I) provides an executive summary of lessons learned from the Constellation Program. A companion document\n(Volume II) provides more detailed analyses for those seeking further insight and information. In this volume, Section 1.0 introduces\nthe approach in preparing and organizing the content to enable rapid assimilation of the lessons. Section 2.0 describes the contextual\nframework in which the Constellation Program was formulated and functioned, which is necessary to understand most of the lessons.\nWhile context of a former program may seem irrelevant in the heady days of new program formulation, some time should be taken to\nunderstand context. Many of the lessons would be different in a different context, so the reader should reflect on similarities and\ndifferences in his or her current circumstances. Section 3.0 summarizes key findings, at the program level, developed from the\nsignificant lessons learned that appear in Section 4.0. Readers can use the key findings in Section 3.0 to peruse for particular topics,\nand will find more supporting detail and analyses in a topical format in Section 4.0. Appendix A contains a white paper describing the\nConstellation Program formulation that may be of use to readers wanting more context or background information\n\n14. SUBJECT TERMS\n\n15.
