In\naddition, the Suite can be run early in\nthe development cycle to find and correct errors in advance of testing.\nThis software suite was developed by Chris\nLand of The Boeing Company and Kathryn\nMoye of the Dynacs Co. for Johnson Space\nCenter.

MSC24158-1\n\nMRO Sequence Checking\nTool\nMRO DKF Post-Processing\nTool\nThis software tool saves time and reduces risk by automating two labor-intensive and error-prone post-processing\nsteps required for every DKF [DSN\n(Deep Space Network) Keyword File]\nthat MRO (Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter) produces, and is being extended\nto post-process the corresponding\nTSOE (Text Sequence Of Events) as\nwell. The need for this post-processing\nstep stems from limitations in the seqgen modeling resulting in incorrect\nDKF generation that is then cleaned up\nin post-processing.\nThis work was done by Shanti Ayap of\nLMCO, and Forest Fisher, Roy Gladden, and\nTeerapat Khanampornpan of NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet\nPropulsion Laboratory.\nThis software is available for commercial licensing.

The suite consists of Java applications, C scripts, VxWorks applications, UNIX utilities, C\nprograms, and configuration files.\nThe UNIX scripts retrieve data from\nthe system and write them to a certain\nset of files. The Java side monitors\nthese files and presents the data in\nuser-friendly formats for operators to\nuse in making troubleshooting decisions. This design allows for rapid prototyping and expansion of higher-level\ndisplays without affecting the basic\ndata-gathering applications. The suite\nis designed to be extensible, with the\nability to add new system components\n\n16\n\nThe MRO Sequence Checking Tool\nprogram, mro_check, automates significant portions of the MRO (Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter) sequence checking\nprocedure. Though MRO has similar\nchecks to the ODY\xe2\x80\x99s (Mars Odyssey)\nMega Check tool, the checks needed for\nMRO are unique to the MRO spacecraft.\nThe MRO sequence checking tool\nautomates the majority of the sequence\nvalidation procedure and check lists\nthat are used to validate the sequences\ngenerated by MRO MPST (mission\nplanning and sequencing team). The\ntool performs more than 50 different\nchecks on the sequence. The automation varies from summarizing data\nabout the sequence needed for visual\nverification of the sequence, to performing automated checks on the sequence and providing a report for each\nstep. To allow for the addition of new\nchecks as needed, this tool is built in a\nmodular fashion.\nThis work was done by Forest Fisher, Roy\nGladden, and Teerapat Khanampornpan of\nCaltech for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\nThis software is available for commercial licensing.

Relative to its\npredecessors, this program is more powerful and easier to use. This program is\nbuilt on the Java Eclipse open-source\nplatform around a Web-browser-based\nuser-interface paradigm to provide an\nintuitive user interface to Mars rovers\nand landers.\n\nThis program affords a combination of advanced display and simulation capabilities. For example, a map\nview of terrain can be generated from\nimages acquired by the High Resolution Imaging Science Explorer instrument aboard the Mars Recon naissance Orbiter spacecraft and\noverlaid with images from a navigation camera (more precisely, a stereoscopic pair of cameras) aboard a\nrover, and an interactive, annotated\nrover traverse path can be incorporated into the overlay. It is also possible to construct an overhead perspective mosaic image of terrain from\nnavigation-camera images.\nThis program can be adapted to similar use on other outer-space missions\nand is potentially adaptable to numerous terrestrial applications involving\nanalysis of data, operations of robots,\nand planning of such operations for acquisition of scientific data.\nThis program was written by Jeffrey S. Norris, Thomas M. Crockett, Jason M. Fox,\nJoseph C. Joswig, Mark W. Powell, Khawaja\nS. Shams, Recaredo J. Torres, Michael N.\nWallick, and David S. Mittman of Caltech\nfor NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\nThis software is available for commercial licensing.

The software constructs a flight\nplan that specifies not only the intended flight path but also the setup of\nthe radar system at each point along\nthe path.\nA user first specifies the desired\nimage swath by specifying certain geographic and geometric features of the\nswath or the desired flight path. Using\nan input digital elevation map (DEM),\nthe software predicts the image swath\nand sets such variables as a data window\nposition (DWP). A raster backscatter\nclassification file co-registered with the\ninput DEM can be used to estimate\nradar attenuation settings. The software\ndetermines whether such radar constraints as those pertaining to duty cycles and data rates are obeyed, and de-\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, November 2008\n\n'
