These are lateral, forward precessional, self-excited, subsynchronous\nvibrations in which the amplitude may vary from very small to nearly the limit of\nthe bearing or seal clearances. Oil whirl i n ;ubi-icated bearings, in particular,\ntypically occurs at somewhat less than half rotative speed. As the rotative speed\nincreases, the frequency relationship remains constant until the whirl frequency\napproaches the first balance resonance. Now the whirl is smoothly replaced by whip\nat a nearly constant frequency asymptotically approaching first balance resonance,\ni ndependent of i ncreasi ng rotative speed. Changes in beari ng/seal radi a1 1 oadi ng\ncan permit, prevent, or eliminate this instability.\n\nF\'LuD3 IN MOTION\nDUE TO SHAFT ROTATION\n\nSOURCE OF INSTABILITY!\nFigure 1.\n\n- Bearing/seal\n\nfluid-generated instability.\n\n06J ECTIVE\n\nThe oil whirl/whip rig demonstrates the effects of fluid dynamic forces generated\nby the rotating shaft. At low rotative speeds, this produces changes of the journal static equilibrium position within the bearing. The demonstrator shows the relationship between any load direction and the average journal oqlii 1 ibrium position\n(attitude angle) (Figure 2 . At higher rotative speeds, the instability threshold\n)\nis observed as a function of unidirectional radial load, unbalance, and rotor\nconfiguration.\n\nFigure 2\n.\n\n- Attitude angle between load direction and average journal equilibrium position.\nORBITS:\n\nWHIP\n\nWHIRL\n\nFigure 3 - Oscilloscope presentation of oil whirl and oil whip orbital motion (vibration\n.\nprecession) of journal, cdined with once-per-turn reference (keyphasor) signal. Keyphasor marks\nmay move forward or backward relative to time depending on ratio of vibration frequency to\nrotative speed.\nspeea.\n\nThe f i x e d relationship between o i l w h i r l frequency and r o t a t i v e speed, as well as\nthe t r a n s i t i o n t o o i l whip a t a frequency s l i g h t l y below the f i r s t balance resonance\nfrequency, may be observed on the oscilloscope (Figure 3) and spectrum analyzer.\nNote the d i s t i n c t i v e oscilloscope o r b i t pattern o f the two Keyphasor marks s l o w l y\nr o t a t i n g counter t o time d i r e c t i o n (stroboscopic e f f e c t ) during o i l w h i r l and the\nm u l t i p l e Keyphasor marks during o i l whip (variable frequency ratios).\nROTOR R I G\n\nThe r o t o r r i g consists o f a single disk r o t o r supported i n an O i l i t e ( o i l impregnated, sintered bronze) bearing a t the inboard end and an o i l lubricated Lucite\njournal bearing a t the outboard end.
