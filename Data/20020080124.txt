b"Lightning Protection\n\nT\n\nI\n\nhe Glasair I11 is a homebuilt aircraft produced from\na kit manufactured by Stoddard-Hamilton Aircraft\nCompany, Arlington, Washington. Kit-built airplanes are more affordable, in part because they are\nassembled by the owner and in part because they do not\nrequire Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) testing and\ncertification, which can be costly.\nFAA treats homebuilts in different fashion from factory produced general aviation planes. They are considered to be experimental, thus cannot be used for\ncommercial purposes, and the owner/operator is considered to be the manufacturer and therefore responsible for\nsafety - so the rigorous safety testing and certification\nprocess normally required for general aviation aircraft is\nwaived.\nThe Glasair 111 is an advanced technology homebuilt,\nconstructed of a fiberglass and graphite fiber composite\nmaterial and equipped with digital instruments.\nComposites offer greater airframe strength at reduced\nweight; digital systems provide greater efficiency in cockpit displays. However, both technologies tend to make the\nairplane more susceptible to lightning effects than conventional instruments and metal airframes because composites are less conductive than the aluminum alloys they\nreplace, and because lightning strikes may interfere with\nsensitive digital electronics.\nSince the Glasair 111 is capable of cross-country\nflight, Stoddard-Hamilton felt that its customers wanted\nthe ability to use the airplane in instrument fl~ght\nconditions. Because instrument weather conditions are very\n\noften the same conditions that produce lightning, the company decided that a lightning-protected version of the\nGlasair 111 would also enable more extensive instrument\nflight, enhancing safety and improving the marketability of\nGlasair 111.\nBecause NASA conducts a continuing program of\nresearch toward improving general aviation safety and\nperformance, Stoddard-Hamilton proposed to Langley\nResearch Center a joint development program to develop\nand test a Glasair 111-LP (Lightning Protected) version\nthat would be able to land safely if struck by lightning.\nLangley, which had long conducted a multiyear Storm\nHazards Research Program, was interested because the\nairplane was made of composites and there was need for\na database on this type of general aviation aircraft.\nAccordingly, Langley awarded a Small Business\nInnovation Research contract to Stoddard-Hamilton for\nthe development. Lightning Technologies, Inc. (LTI),\nPittsfield, Massachusetts, one of the key players in the\nStorm Hazards Research Program, was selected as the\nsubcontractor responsible for the lightning protection\ndesign and testing. Analytical Services and Materials,\nHampton, Virginia and Aero Space Consultants, Newport\nNews, Virginia provided engineering and documentation\nsupport.\nThe accompanying photos illustrate a key test in\nthe Langley/industry Glasair program. The prototype\nGlasair 111-LP is being subjected to a 1.5 million volt\nstrike-attachment test in LTl's simulated lightning laboratory, one of a battery of tests normally required by the\n\nI\n\nFAA for certification of a factory-produced aircraft. The\nGlasair 111-LP successfully passed this and other tests and\nbecame the first kit-built composite aircraft to be Iightning tested and protection-verified under the guidelines\nused by the FAA to certify general aviation aircraft.\nTo achieve that status, LTI designed a protection system to ensure that lightning would not cause catastrophic\nstructural damage, disabling electrical shocks to occupants, loss of aircraft control, ignition of fuel vapors, loss\nof propulsion, loss of instrument flight rules (IFR) capability, or loss of electrical power or engine controls.\nBecause the Glasair 111 is constructed of fiberglass\ncomposites that offer no inherent protection against lightning, a layer of expanded aluminum foil was added to the\n\nsurface of the fiberglass to provide basic electrical\ncontinuity and shielding for the entire airframe. Special\nattention was given to the electrical bonding of aircraft\ncomponents to allow safe passage of lightning currents on\nthe exterior of the aircraft.\nThe fuel system was protected by a specially\ndesigned fuel filler cap and by the isolation of fuel and\nfuel gauges from conducting surfaces. The interior compartment was entirely isolated from the exterior conducting surfaces and an equipotential plane was provided to\nminimize voltage difference throughout the airplane. The\nelectrical and avionics systems were protected by careful\nattention to grounding and shielding and by the use of\nsurge suppression devices.\n\n"
