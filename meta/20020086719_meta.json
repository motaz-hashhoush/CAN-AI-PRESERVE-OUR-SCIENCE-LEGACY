The key is Aquaspace Compound, a proprietary WWI formula that scientifically blends various types of glandular activated charcoal with other active and inert ingredients. Aquaspace systems remove some substances; chlorine, by atomic adsorption, other types of organic chemicals by mechanical filtration and still others by catalytic reaction. Aquaspace filters are finding wide acceptance in industrial, commercial, residential and recreational applications in the U.S. and abroad.", "title": "Water Filters", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-20T23:29:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-09-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20020086719, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20020086719, "id": "1187671121a44f538f5f1ac553b1d1ba", "publicationName": "Spinoff 1988", "publicationDate": "1988-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20020086719.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20020086719/downloads/20020086719.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20020086719/downloads/20020086719.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20020086719/downloads/20020086719.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
