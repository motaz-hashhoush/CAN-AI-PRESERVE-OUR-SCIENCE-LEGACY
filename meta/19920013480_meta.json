Specifically, this sensor will permit robots and their attached payloads to avoid collisions in space with humans and other objects and to dock these payloads in a cluttered environment. The sensor is simple, robust, and inexpensive to manufacture with obvious and recognized commercial possibilities. Accordingly, NASA/GSFC, in conjunction with industry, is embarking on an effort to 'spin' this technology off into the private sector. This effort includes prototypes aimed at commercial applications. The principles of operation of these prototypes are described along with hardware, software, modelling, and test results. The hardware description includes both the physical sensor in terms of a flexible printed circuit board and the electronic circuitry. The software description will include filtering and detection techniques. The modelling will involve finite element electric field analysis and will underline techniques used for design optimization.", "title": "Commercial Capaciflector", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T17:18:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19920013480, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Vranish, John M."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Goddard Space Flight Center", "location": "Greenbelt, MD, United States"}}, "id": "3f8f929a70804d18b3103d6079d09b8b"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19920013480, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19920013480, "id": "5854a2b1abdc49e491a88a1d68a8f0df", "publicationName": "NASA, Washington, Technology 2001: The Second National Technology Transfer Conference and Exposition, Volume 2", "publicationDate": "1991-12-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19920013480.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19920013480/downloads/19920013480.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19920013480/downloads/19920013480.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19920013480/downloads/19920013480.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
