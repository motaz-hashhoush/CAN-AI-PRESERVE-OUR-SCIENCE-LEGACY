These vehicles have been selected and modified to provide capabilities that are particularly important for geophysical research, in particular, routine access to very high altitudes, long range, long endurance, precise trajectory control, and the payload capacity to operate multiple, diverse instruments concurrently. While the NASA program has been in operation for over 30 years, new aircraft and technological advances that will expand the capabilities for airborne observation are continually being assessed and implemented. This presentation will review the current state of NASA's science platforms, recent improvements and new missions concepts as well as provide a survey of emerging technologies unmanned aerial vehicles for long duration observations (Global Hawk and Predator). Applications of information technology that allow more efficient use of flight time and the ability to rapidly reconfigure systems for different mission objectives are addressed.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "France", "submissionId": 20110008310, "endDate": "2010-10-31T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "2010 International Conference on Airborne Research for the Environment (ICARE)", "location": "Toulouse", "id": "945b668a0f124b5dbe0afd97e242bdbe", "startDate": "2010-10-25T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20110008310, "id": "0ce45556fe9d4c199297b91b442a95a6", "publicationDate": "2010-10-26T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20110008310.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20110008310/downloads/20110008310.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20110008310/downloads/20110008310.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20110008310/downloads/20110008310.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
