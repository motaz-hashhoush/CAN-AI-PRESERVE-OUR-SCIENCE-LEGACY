Activities sssoclated with a Program Year encompass all Phase I projects which result from an\nannual Program Solicitation and the Phase II projects subsequently selected for continuation. The appendices provide\nbackground information on the SBIR program, statistics on NASA\'s program to date, the technical topic and subtopic\nareas in which proposals were solicited In 1988, and Information about the award salectlon process. The five Indexes\ncontain listings through which cross-references may be made for projects, companies, their locations by state, the\nNASA Field Center rssponslble for each project\'s management, and the principal Investigator for each one. For\nsimplicity, each project has been assigned a sequential Identifying number, from 001 to 228, In ascandlng order as\nfound in the body of the report.\nThe objective of this report Is to provide Information about the SBIR program to anyone concerned with\nNASA R&D activities Including managers of NASA projects, prime contractors who could benefit from the research\nconducted through SBIR, industrial concerns and Investors who may support further development and marketing of\nthe results of SBIR projects, and small business firms that may wish to submit SBIR proposals and need Information\non the types of projects of Interest to NASA. The Information In the abstracts was supplied by the particlpsting small\nbusiness companlss and has been Issued by NASA solely for the purpose of Information exchange. NASA does\nnot guarantee its accuracy or validity. Readers are encouraged to contact the small businesses for further information\nor clarification.\nThe closing date for the 1988 SBIR Program Solicitation was July 22, 1988, at which time NASA had received\n2379 Phase I proposals from small business firms. After the evaluation and salectlon processes were completed,\nNASA announced on December 7,1988 that 228 proposals had been chosen to receive six-month Phase I contract\nawards. Following complstlon of contract negotiations early In 1989, contracts for these projects were placed with\n186 dlfferant small R&D firms located In 28 states.\nInitiated In 1983, the NASA SBIR program has been supporting Innovative R&D projects of Interest to the\nagency and the aerospace community with funds set aside from the agency\'s research and development budget.\nSince Fiscal Year 1986, as required by law, that funding set-aside has been 1.25 percent of NASA\'s annual budget\nfor extramural R&D. For Fiscal Year 1989, $53 millions have been provided to the NASA SBIR program resulting In\na total of $208 millions for all years of the program to date. Slncs the NASA budget supports, in large part, the\naccomplishment of dedicated mission and R&D goals and has limited flexibility In the optional use of these specifically budgeted funds, the SBIR program constitutes a significant portion of the agency\'s dlscrstlonary research effort.\n\nProgram management Is provided by the SBIR Program Office In the NASA Headquarters Office of Commercial Programs. The proposals are evaluated by nine NASA Field Centers who also let the contracts and manage\nIndividual projects.

Implementation of the program\nfollows policy directives Issued by the Small Buslnass Administration (SBA). Eligibility Is limited to US-owned companies operating In the US having fewer than 500 employees at the time a contract is awarded.\nPurposes of the Program: The purposes of the Small Business Innovation Research program Include\nstimulating US technological innovation In the private sector, strengthening the role of small businesses in masting\nFederal research and development needs, Increasing the commercial application of Federally supported research\nresults, and fostering and encouraging participation by minority and disadvantaged persons In technological\ninnovation. Achievement of these purposes is accomplished through actions taken by the agency to meet its own\nparticular R&D needs within the program framework established by the laws and the SBA policy directive guidelines.\nSBIR Program Phases: As specified by the enabling legislation, SBIR Is a three-phase R&D program. For\nPhase I, the objectives are to establish the feasibility and merit of an innovative scientific or technical concept\nproposed by a small business responding to a need or opportunity delineated by the agency In an annual program\nsolicitation. Contracts for Phase I are awarded through a competitive selection process based upon the evaluation\nof Phase I proposals submitted In response to an annual program solicitation.\nPhase II of SBtR Is the principal research and development effort, having as its purpose the further\ndevelopment of the proposed ideas to meet the particular program needs. Only Phase I contractors may submit\nproposals to continue their Phase I research into Into Phase II. The selection of Phase II awards considers the\nscientific and technical merit and feasibility evidenced by the first phase, the expected value of the research to the\nagency, and the competence of the firm to conduct Phase II. In addition, for Phase II proposals considered to have\nessentially equivalent scientific merit and feasibility, special consideration is given to those for which valid nonfederal funding commitments have been obtained for Phase III activities.\nIn Phase III, the small business can pursue commercial applications of the results of the SBIR-funded research and research and development (R/R&D). Phase III for commercial purposes is strongly encouraged by NASA\nas a major SBIR objective. Phase III may also take the form of follow-on R/R&D or production contracts with NASA\nor other federal agencies for products and processes intended for use by the United States Government; however,\nsuch Phase Iit activities cannot be supported by the SBIR program funding set-aside.\nPhase I and II Funding Levels: NASA funding for SBIR projects Is In keeping with guidelines for the SBIR\nprogram issued by the Small Business Administration. Phase I contracts are generally limited to six months In\nduration and $50,000, while contracts for Phase II, the major R&D effort, are normally limited to two years\' duration\nand funding of not more than $500,000. NASA may make justifiable exceptions.\nProposal Evalua_on and Award SelecUon: Evaluations of both Phase I and II proposals follow SBA Policy\nguidelines and include technical merit and Innovativeness, NASA R&D needs and priorities, program balance, and\ncompany capabilities. There are no quotas for specific technical areas. For Phase I, proposed cost within the stated\ncost guideline is not an evaluation or selection criterion and appropriate for the proposed activity. For Phase 11, he\nt\nPhase I results are a major factor and cost is an important consideration. And as noted above, for Phase II\nproposals of essentially equivalent merit, special consideration Is given to those which include valid non-federal capital\ncommitments for Phase III activities, particularly for pursulng commercial applications. Evaluators Include NASA\ntechnical staff members at the field centers responsible for the Subtopics and the NASA Headquarters program\nofficials. NASA at its discretion may also use outside evaluators.\nProgram History: The NASA SBIR program began In 1983 with the issuance of the first of its annual program\nsolicitations. Support for this program is shown In Table A-l, which displays the annual R&D funding set-aside\n(which progressively Increased to the present 1.25 percent level) for the NASA SBIR program. Table A-2 shows the\n\nPRECEDING PAGE BLANK NOT FILMED\nNASASBIR 1988 Phase I Awards 65\n\nnumber of Phase I proposals received each program year and the number of resulting awards and funding for Phase\nI contracts. This table also presents the number of Phase II proposals that were submitted from each group of Phase\nI projects and the numbers selected for award and the total value of the Phase II contracts for each program year.\n(A program year Includes all Phase I and Phase II projects rasultlng from an annual Program Solicitation.) During\nthe first five complete Program Years (1983 through 1987) and Phase I of the 1988 and 1989 programs, $244 million\nwas obligated or committed for 1231 Phase I and 398 Phase II awards. Recently, NASA announced the selection\nof 112 of the 1988 Phase I projects for negotiations leading to Phase II SBIR contracts. On the average, approxImately 16 percent of NASA\'s SBIR funds have been used for Phase I projects and 84 percent for Phase II In each\nprogram year.\nSmall businesses have responded vigorously to the opportunities presented by the SBIR program. The\nnumber of Phase I proposals grew from 977 In 1983 to 2,141 in 1989. The number of Phase I awards selected has\nbeen limited each year not by the number of acceptable proposals, but by the funds available and the desire that\nat least haft of the Phase I projects proceed Into Phase II. Awards have been made to 650 firms In 42 states, the\nDlstdct of Columbia and Puerto Rico. The numbers of Phase I and Phase II awards made within each state are\nshown on Exhibit A-1. Approximately 18 percent of the firms submitting proposals have received Phase I awards,\nand about 48 percent of those firms have received Phase II continuations.\n\n66\n\nNASASBIR 1988 Phase I Awards\n\nTABLE\n\nNASA\n\nSBIR\n\nFISCAL\n\nA-1\n\nYEAR\n\nFUNDING\n\nFISCAL\nYEAR\n1983\n\nNASA R&D BUDGET\n\n% R&D BUDGET\n\nNASA SBIR\n\nFISCAL\nYEAR\n1986\n\nFISCAL\nYEAR\n1987\n\nFISCAL\nYEAR\n1988\n\nFISCAL\nYEAR\n1989\n\n2205.00\n\n2425.00\n\n2619.00\n\n3128.00\n\n3270.00\n\n4166.00\n\n0.20\n\nTOTALS\n\n- $M\n\n1.00\n\n1.25\n\n1.25\n\n1.25\n\n1.25\n\n13.23\n\n24.25\n\n32.74\n\n38.92\n\n40.87\n\n52.97\n\n4.94\n\n- $M\n\n0.60\n\n4.94\n\nFOR SBIR\n\nBUDGET\n\nCUMULATIVE\n\nFISCAL\nYEAR\n1985\n\n2473.00\n\n- $M\n\nFISCAL\nYEAR\n1984\n\n18.17\n\n42.42\n\n75.16\n\n114.08\n\n154.95\n\n207.92\n\nTABLE\n\nNASA\n\nSBIR\n\nPROGRAM\n\nA-2\n\nAWARD\n\nPROPOSALS\n\nAWARDS\n\nFUNDING\n\nPROPOSALS\n\nAWARDS\n\nPROGRAM\nFUNDING\n\nFUNDING\n\n$M\n\nSM\n\nYEAR\n\nTOTAL\n\nTOTAL\n\nTOTAL\n\nPROGRAM\n\nPHASE I & II\n\nPHASEII\n\nPHASEI\n\nSOLICITATION\n\nSTATISTICS\n\nSM\n\n1983\n\n977\n\n102\n\n5.0\n\n92\n\n58\n\n24.0\n\n29.0\n\n1984\n\n919\n\n127\n\n6.3\n\n113\n\n71\n\n3?-5\n\n38.8\n\n1985\n\n1164\n\n150\n\n7.4\n\n129\n\n84\n\n39.4\n\n46.8\n\n1986\n\n1628\n\n172\n\n8.5\n\n164\n\n85\n\n39.6\n\n48.1\n\n1987\n\n1826\n\n2O4\n\n10.0\n\n179\n\n100\n\n47.9\n\n57.9\n\n1988\n\n2379\n\n228\n\n11.2\n\n2O4\n\n112\n\n53.7 (1)\n\n64.9 (1)\n\n1989\n\n2142\n\n251\n\n12.4 (1)\n\nNA\n\nNA\n\nTOTALS\nTO\nDATE\n_LO_.T_:\n\n(I)\n\n11035\n\n1234\n\n60,8\n\n871\n\n510\n\nNA\n\nNA\n\n237.1\n\n(1)\n\n285.5\n\n(1)\n\n(6 YEARS)\n\nESTIMATED\n\n87\nNASA SBIR 1988 Phase I Awards\n\nTABLE\n\nA-3\n\nNASA SBIR AWARDS\nDISTRIBUTION\nBY NASA FIELD CENTER\nFIELD\n\nAMES\n\nRESEARCH\n\nGODDARD\n\n1_9\nPHASEI\n\nCENTER\n\nSPACE\n\nFLIGHT\n\nTOTAL\nPHASE\n\nCENTER\n\nTOTAL\nPHASE !1\n\nTOTAL\nPHASE I & II\n\n27\n\nCENTER\n\n65\n\n215\n\n38\n\n73\n\n241\n\n55\n\n186\n\nJET PROPULSION\n\nLABORATORY\n\n25\n\nJOHNSON\n\nSPACE\n\nCENTER\n\n37\n\n67\n\n238\n\nKENNEDY\n\nSPACE\n\nCENTER\n\n11\n\n23\n\n81\n\nLANGLEY\n\nRESEARCH\n\n77\n\n264\n\n73\n\n260\n\nLEWIS\n\nRESEARCH\n\nMARSHALL\nSTENNIS\n\n35\n\nCENTER\n\nSPACE\nSPACE\n\nCENTER\n\nFLIGHT\n\n131\n\n187\n\n37\nCENTER\n\n36\n\n169\n\n74\n\n243\n\n5\n\n12\n\n3\n\n15\n\nCENTER\n\nTOTALS\n\n251\n\nEXHIBIT\n\nNASA SBIR AWARD\n\n1,234\n\n510\n\n1,744\n\nA-1\n\nDISTRIBUTION\n\nBY STATES\n\nwY\n\nA\n\nRI\n\n,s\n\nHI\n\n(_)\n_-_\n\np\n\n<\'"_%\'_\n\ng\n\nL_\n\nBE-1\n\nPHASE\n\nI & I!\n\nB7-1\n\nPHASE\n\n_ & II\n\n8B-!\n\nPHASE\n\nI &\n\nBg-f\n\nqr\n\n(234)\n\nee-,PHASEIS. _5_\nPHASE\nTO[AL\n\nI\n\nN\n\n(304)\n(340)\n\n1.744\n\nAWARDS IN 42 STATES, O.C.
