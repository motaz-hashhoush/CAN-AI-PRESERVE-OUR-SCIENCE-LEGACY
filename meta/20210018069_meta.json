In order to maintain JSC\u2019s leadership in human spaceflight, there is a need for working at the speed of commercial industry, breaking down silos between organizations, improving innovation and increasing workforce flexibility. Through brainstorming concepts and benchmarking other facilities, the leadership team evaluated several ideas, assessed constraints and derived that an \u201cInnovation Team\u201d was relatively easy to adopt. Modeled after productive teams like the Jet Propulsion Laboratory\u2019s Innovation Foundry and Glenn Research Center's Compass team, JSC is laying the foundation of a new innovation team called the Forge. This team is as much about getting employees tempered in the ways of innovative thinking as it is about refining design studies and hammering out proposals. By the dictionary definition of the verb, forge can mean either to move ahead slowly and steadily or to move with a sudden increase of speed and power. Driving cultural change in a large government organization like NASA often involves slow perseverance with small injections of momentum to forge ahead. Leveraging lessons learned from the Innovation Foundry and Compass, this paper describes how the collaborative, concurrent engineering framework was tailored to JSC\u2019s needs, as well as the aspects that were considered given JSC\u2019s operation-focused, Program-driven landscape. Our process to drive cultural change, the steps taken, and challenges encountered are discussed. The first two pilots of the teaming framework are described with initial results presented in terms of employee engagement and fostering innovation. We also describe the planned future work and next steps to continue to push the initiative forward. Long has the Center been resting on its operations heritage, now we are forging a new path to Dare to expand frontiers, Unite with our partners and Explore space to benefit humanity.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "US", "submissionId": 20210018069, "endDate": "2022-03-12T06:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"organizationId": "c89d4cba478b520a8c47b5bcac2f6911", "meta": {"organization": {"name": "Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers", "location": "Piscataway, New Jersey, United States"}}, "meetingId": "2ccff6ef15a347e5a14666d460949ad2", "id": "112a24c73ae149dd9e3469eaa3731d13"}], "name": "IEEE Aerospace 2022", "location": "Big Sky, MT", "id": "2ccff6ef15a347e5a14666d460949ad2", "url": "https://www.aeroconf.org/cms/content_attachments/26/download", "startDate": "2022-03-05T06:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": true, "mimetype": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "name": "ForgetheForgeAbstract.docx", "type": "ABSTRACT", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20210018069/downloads/ForgetheForgeAbstract.docx", "pdf": "/api/citations/20210018069/downloads/ForgetheForgeAbstract.docx.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20210018069/downloads/ForgetheForgeAbstract.docx.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
