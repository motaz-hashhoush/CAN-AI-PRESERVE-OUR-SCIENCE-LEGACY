b'Space Coatings\n\nfor\nIndustry\n\nA line of lubricants\n\nand\n\nprotective\ncoatings\nderived from space\ntechnology\nheads a\nsampling of spinoff\nproducts and processes\ncontributing\nto industrial\nefficiency and\nproductivity\n\n64\n\nA spinoff coating helps control\n"outgassing "-- material burnoff -- in\nsolar collection systems, thereby\npreventing\nloss of heat-collecting\n\nefficiency.\nThe coating is used on the\nSunpump Solar Energy System shown,\nwhich is produced\nby Entropy Ltd.,\nBoulder, Colorado.\n\nIn the early 1960s, when space flight\nwas in its infancy, NASA experienced\na\nproblem in developing a Sun-study\nspacecraft\nknown as the Orbiting Solar\nObservatory\n(OSO). NASA\'s contractor\nfor OSO--Ball\nAerospace\nSystems\nDivision, Boulder, Colorado--found\nthat conventional\nlubricating\nmaterials,\ndeveloped\nfor Earth conditions,\nwere\nunsuitable\nfor use on satellite moving\nparts and instruments\nthat would be\nexposed to the vacuum of space for\nmonths and even years.\nSo, to meet OSO requirements,\nBall\nAerospace\nfirst had to develop entirely\nnew space lubrication\ntechnologies.\nFrom extensive company research on\nthe requisite properties\nof spacecraft\nmaterials, there emerged a new family\nof dry lubricants specifically designed\nfor long life in space, together with\nprocesses for applying them to spacecraft components\nin microscopically\nthin coatings. The lubricants worked\nsuccessfully on seven OSO flights over\nthe span of a decade and attracted\nthe\nattention of other contractors,\nwho became Ball customers.\nAt the same time, the company\n,found that the lubricating properties\nneeded for long service life in orbit\noffered advantages\nin many nonaerospace\napplications\nand\nbegan to explore those avenues.\nOver the years, the company\nacquired further space coating\nexperience\nas builder of 10 satellites\nand participant\nin a number of other\nspace programs. This work, along\nwith parallel company research\nand development\ntoward commercial\napplications,\nestablished\nBall\nas a leader in the field of\nlubricants\nand protective\ncoatings for\nboth aerospace and non-aerospace\nuse.\nThe company has developed several\nhundred variations of the original OSO\ntechnology,\ngenerally designed to\nimprove the quality and useful life of a\nwide range of products, or to improve\nthe efficiency of the industrial\nprocesses by which such products\nare manufactured.\nAn example involves an old problem\nin glass container\nmanufacturing.\nHot\nglass sometimes sticks as it forms in the\nmetal mold; to prevent that, a "release\ncoating" must be applied to the mold.\nIn the common procedure,\nan operator\nreaches into the high speed equipment\nperiodically\nto swab coating material\nonto the hot mold, a method that\nsubjects the operator to hazard;\nadditionally,\nthe swabbing material\n\nApplied to metal molds used in\nmanufacture\nof glass containers such\n\nas those pictured, a coating derived\nfrom space technology reduces\nadhesion between the molds and hot\n\nglass, contributing\nto improved process\nefficiency and fewer container rejects.\n\ngenerally used generates copious fumes,\nwhich must be limited for health reasons.\n\nMount for NASA\'s Skylab\nprogram, for which the company\ndeveloped special coating materials\nto prevent "outgassing"-chemical\nbreakdown\nof materials which causes\ncontamination\nof adjacent surfaces.\nBall Aerospace\nis applying this\ntechnology to solar energy collection\nsystems. Some materials outgas rapidly\nat the high temperatures\nin solar\ncollectors;\noutgassing can contaminate\nthe transparent\ncovers of the collectors and reduce the system\'s ability\nto capture and transfer solar heat. By\nproper selection of coating materials-along with cleaning procedures,\ndesign,\nhandling and storage techniques-outgassing can be controlled\nto\n\nhelp maintain maximum solar\ncollector efficiency.\nOther examples of Ball\nmaterials technology\napplied in nonaerospace\nusage include a spray-on\npreservative\ncoating for protecting\nthe\nsound fidelity of phonograph\nrecords;\na coating for motion picture film\ndesigned to reduce film breakage;\na lubricant used by meat processing\ncompanies\nto solve machinery\nbreakdown problems experienced\nin "cold\nroom" conditions;\nand a method of\ntreating electric motor and generator\nbrushes which sharply reduces brush\nwear rates.\n\nIn a variation of the space-derived\ntechnology,\nBall Aerospace\ndeveloped\na bonded release coating to ease the\nproblem. Marketed\nunder the trade\nname HIPAK TM, the coating is sprayed\nonto the molds and heat-cured\nbefore\nthe molds are used. The HIPAK\ncoating reduces adhesion between\nglass and molds, thereby reducing the\nnumber of hand-swabbing\noperations\nrequired. It offers increased\noperator safety, fewer container\nrejects and less exposure to fumes for\nthose working near the machinery.\nAnother example stems from Ball\'s\nwork on the Apollo Telescope\n\nTM\nHIPAK\n\nis a trademark\n\nof Ball Corporation.\n\n65\n\n'
