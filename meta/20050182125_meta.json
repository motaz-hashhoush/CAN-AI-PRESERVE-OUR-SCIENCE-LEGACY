With agency-wide responsibility for defining the meteoroid environments for spacecraft engineering operations purposes, the MEO will distribute a state-of-the-art sporadic meteoroid model as well as meteor shower forecasts for spacecraft operators. To improve these models and forecasts, the MEO will manage an observation and research program. Office responsibilities, products, and plans will be discussed in this paper. The MEO is sponsored by the Office of Safety and Mission Assurance at NASA Headquarters.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"country": "Germany", "submissionId": 20050182125, "endDate": "2005-04-20T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "European Space Agency.
