SPIRIT is a two-element Michelson interferometer operating over a nominal wavelength range 25 to 400 microns and offering a powerful combination of spectroscopy and sub-arcsecond angular resolution imaging in a single instrument. With angular resolution comparable to that of JWST and far-IR sensitivity nearly two orders of magnitude better than that of the Spitzer Space Telescope, SPIRIT will measure the resonant structures in exozodi debris disks to find and characterize extrasolar planets; characterize the atmospheres of selected extrasolar gas giant planets; elucidate the evolution of young stellar systems and their planet-forming potential; and track the luminosity evolution and chemical and dust enrichment of galaxies on a cosmological timescale. SPIRIT could be ready to launch as early as 2015. The SPIRIT study is sponsored by NASA under the Origins Science Mission Concept study program.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20050071070, "endDate": "2005-01-13T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Astronomical Society", "location": "United States"}}, "meetingId": "1543eca518084b2fb984201eb9dc5e8d", "id": "15f4dc99f05140c2b73e3dd759aef78d"}], "name": "American Astronomical Society Meeting", "location": "San Diego, CA", "id": "1543eca518084b2fb984201eb9dc5e8d", "startDate": "2005-01-09T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20050071070, "id": "0287d3ea4fdb477091fd5827c49e8561", "publicationDate": "2005-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
