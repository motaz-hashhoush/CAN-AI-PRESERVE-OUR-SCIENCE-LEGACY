This newly developed chip rapidly responds to the presence of moisture, especially in condensed form and in presence of ionic impurities. It determines whether moisture has permeated a hermetically sealed package or a plastic encapsulated microcircuit. The sensor chip was designed as a \"go/no go\" chip, which is assembled with other chips in a multi-chip module to assess the risk of failure for the entire module.
