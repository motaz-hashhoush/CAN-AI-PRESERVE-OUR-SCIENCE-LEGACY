Includes two members; first member rotates about pin at end of second member. Includes cam, over which tension line stretched. Ends of tension line anchored at end of second member opposite end that holds pin. Bladder placed on each side of second member, squeezed between second member and tension line. Pressures and/or amounts of fluid in bladders controlled by use of conventional equipment like pumps, valves, and reservoirs. Bladder on one side inflated more than on other side; greater inflation on one side causes greater stretching of tension line on that side. Greater tension pulls on cam, turning first member toward that side. Angle of joint controlled by controlling differential inflation of two bladders.", "title": "Robotic Bladder Joint", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-17T00:15:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19950065503, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Robertson, Glen A."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Marshall Space Flight Center, Huntsville, AL."}}, "id": "cf3b0c7a3b094ceda94af0dfe9f1e267"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Other - NASA Tech Brief", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-19T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19950065503, "publications": [{"volume": "19", "submissionId": 19950065503, "issue": "7", "issn": "0145-319X", "id": "aab203dfb0a842bb89bdd402565b82f9", "publicationName": "NASA Tech Briefs", "publicationDate": "1995-07-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
