Until the present time, techn.ques of adjusting the transmitter have not\nproduced sufficiently precise circular polarization. This paper contains a full\ndescription of the design and development of circuitry to sense the polarization\nand to alter the parameters of the transmitter so that its output becomes circular. The operation nf this circuitry is discussed in detail.\n\n_\t\n\n^\t\na\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nI would like to especially thank Mr. G. W. Henry, Jr. and Mr. T. W.

DESIGN OF POLARIZATION ADJUSTMENT\nINSTRUMENTATION FOR A ROCKET PROPAGATION\nEXPERIMENT\n\nby\nR. C. Condon\nE. A. Mechtly\n\n^\t\n\n-a\n\nV"_\n\n1. INTRODUCTION\n\nRadio propagation experiments conducted by the Aeronomy Laboratory to determine electron density and collision frequency from measurements of differential\nabsr;rption and Faraday rotation in the D-region of the ionosphere, make use of\ntransmitted circularly polarized waves (Knoebel et al., 1966). There exists a\nneed for\n\nit\n\nsystem which is able to determine if\' the polarization is indeed cir-\n\ncular as required. If the polarization is found to be in error, then the system\nshould be able to correct the error. Ale following sections outline a method of\ni\ndetecting any deviation from circular polarization in either the ordinary or the\nt\nextraordinary mode of propagation. A system which will detect and correct the\ndeviations is discussed in detail.\n1.1 Apparatus Used in Producing Circular Polarization\nThe transmitted circularly polarized waves originate from a ground-based\nantenna array, which consists of four horizontal half-wavelength dipoles, elevated\nune quarter wavelength above tli-- ground plane. T hese dipoles are arranged as\nthe sides of a square, and opposite sides are fed in parallel (Knoebel et al.,\n1966). By means of this array (depicted in Figure 1.1), the two modes of propagation, ordinary and extraordinary, are transmitted to the rocket. These modes\nare circularly polarized and oppositely sensed. The frequencies of the two moues\nare usually in the two to four megahertz range, and differ from one another by\n500 Hz.\nFigure 1.2 illustrates the ordinar y and the extraordinary modes rotating\nrY\t\ng\ng\t\nin opposite directions, producing a 500 Hz resultant, whose polarization axis\nrotates in free space at 250 rps (Seino. 1968). !his is accomplished by means\nof the ordinary mode rotating North into West, tracing out a circle of frequency\n\n= i\n\nW-\n\n2\n\nCONNECTIONS:\nA\t\nA\nB\t\nB\nC\t\nC\nD\t\nD\nX/2\n\nX/2\n\nC D\nWOO D\nPOLE\nX/4\n\n^GROUND\n\nPLANE\nFigure 1.1 Top and front views of the square transmitting\n\nantenna array.\n\nKEW\n\nJ\n\nW\n\nZ\t\n\n^\n\n}\n\nQ\n\nz\n\nv\nQ\n\nLJ.\n\n.a\n\nu\nX\n\n7\n\nN\n\nH\nN\n\nN\n\nz\n\nwu\n\nQ\n^\n\nti\n\ncd o0\n\n0 0\n\nJ\n\nN\nO\n\n^\nw\n\n7 y\n\nti\n\nLr rJ\n\nQ) N\nW\n\nN\n\nm\nJ `.\n\ni\n\nu\nw\n\ni\n\nfJr\n\na\n\n}\n\na\nz\n\n0\n\nzEn\now\n\nO\n\nNOa\nw X 0\nQ (n N\n\nOXH\naQa\n\n4\n\nf\n\n= f\n\n- 250 Iiz, where f\n\nis the center frequency of the transmitter. Similarly,\n\nthe extraordinary mode rotates North into East, tracing a circle of frequency\nf\n\n= f\n\n+ 250 Hz Nechtly et al., 1967).\n\nIn Figure 1.3, the effects of a 10 dB difference in the p ower levels of\nthe ordinary and extraordinary modes are shown. Normally, t y e ordinary has the\nlarger power level of the two modes, and this power differential causes the overall shape of the resultant to be elliptical. However, ;.ts axis is still rotating\nat 250 rps, but due to the elliptical nature of the reFL7.ant, the rocket\nreceiver now observes a total resultant which has a freq_e ri-y of 2 x 250 Hz (Seino,\n\n1968).\n1.2 Preliminary Polarization Adjustments\nThe testing of the transmitting antenna array for circular polarization\nis preceeded by arranging the dipoles and feedlines of the array as symmetrically\nas possible (Knoebel et al., 1966). Then after tuning the transmitter, the output of the antenna array is determined by attenuating one of the transmitting\nmodes by a factor or 50 dB, leaving the other mode to propagate alone. Next a\nsmall (approxim_:tely 20 cm in length) ferrite rod antenna, called a "whirly", is\nplaced in thc: exact center of the array. The whirly rotates horizontally in a\nplane parallel to the ground plane (Figure 1.4). \'Ibis rotation, together with\nthe output of the transmitting array, which now consist\'- of only one mode, is\nobserved on the oscilloscope of Figure 1.4. \'Ihis scope produces a display\nof amplitude versus time, so that the elliptically polarized resultant which\nappears, is shown as a modulated carrier (Figure 1.5a). Therefore, b y means of\nadjusting the manual attenuator and phase shifter (which are shown later in Figure\n1.7), the polarization can be altered visually, until minimum modulation of the\ncarrier appears on the scope. Ideally, this would finally produce a carrier\n\nI\n\n-_ Li ,\n\nt\n\nr\n\n3\nS\n\nZ.\nG_\n\nU\nN\n\n4)\n\nv\n\na\nN ^^\n\n^O\na0\nJ U-)\n\nO\na^\nJ\n\nW\n\na ^\'\n\nc^ o\nf-\n\nO\n\nv\n\nJ a\nJ\nW\n\nv\n0\nco\n\nN\n\nZ V)\n\nO\n\nfa -\'\n\nO\n\nW\n\n,3 00\nO ^^\n\nw\n\nQa a\nNO\n\n0 0\n\nG\n\n^x0\nQ V) N\n\nO x Fa.aa\n\n0 J)\n0\n41\n\ni\n\nH\nZ\n\n0\n\nW\n\ncw\n\na\nJ\n\nZ\t\n\n-\n\nM\n1\n\nW\n\nw\n\n4a\n\nh0\nCL\n\nX\nQ\n\nZ\n\n0\n\nO\n\nZ\n\nN\t\n\nO\n\nN\n\n0\t\n\nF-\t\n\nO\n\nCV\t\n\nX\t\nW\t\n\nL0\nCV\n\n+\n\n6\n\nG\n.r,\nE\n..a\n\nF+\n\nP4\n\nb\na^\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2o\nr-.Ln\n\na4^\n\nc*t C\nC1\n\na^ E\n^\nN\na-+ V)\n\nO\n\nO\n\nce\ncd C\nF.

After\none of th12 modes has been circularized, the second mode is adiusted by a\nsimilar procedure.\nHaving attained circular polarization of both modes, we now have to\ndetermine the direction of rotation of their polarization axes. The direction\ncan be determined by disconnecting the trigger lead in Figure 1.4 from the\noscilloscope. One mode is then propagated alone with the whirly at rest and\na cycle count is made, which consists of recording the frequency of the received\nsignal. Similar cycle counts are made with the whirly rotating in both the\nclockwise and the counterclockwise directions, and these three results are\ncompared. The direction of whirly rotation which is found to yield a cycle\ncount lower than that of the mode propagating alone, is in fact the direction\nof rotation of that mode. As a check, the cycle count with the whirly rotating\nin the other direction, should be higher.\nUntil the present time, the above tests, and all other polarization tests\nwhich have been attempted, have not provided the desired precision in establishing and maintaining circular polarization. Such factors as undesirable near\nfield effects, and the fact that the rocket does not proceed along the axis of\nthe antenna beam, are two of the possible reasons for the imprecision. It must\nbe noted however, that regardless of other inaccuracies in the testing methods,\nthe directions of rotation, once having been found, are indeed correct and\nremain correct for the duration of the rocket flight.\n1.3 Characteristics of Elliptical Polarization\nWe can represent elliptical polarization by means of two orthogonal\nharmonic oscillations. These oscillations can be depicted as cosine motions\n\nVF-\n\n9\n\n3\n1\n\nof the form:\n\nhly = a l cos\n\n(wt\n\n+ ^1 )\t\'\n\n\t\n\n(1.1)\n\nand\n\nHZ = a 2 cos(wt + ^2\n\n)\t\'\n\nassuming the positive x-direction as the direction of propagation.\nEquations (1.1) can be expanded by the trigonometric identity for the\ncosine of the sum of two angles, and thus take the form:\n\nH\n\ny\n\na\n\n= coswt cos^ l - sinwt sin^i\n\n1\n\n\t\nand\n\n(1.2)\n\na^\n\nV\t\n\nH\n?\na\t\n\n= coswt c os^,, - sinwt sin^2\n\n2\n\nE\n\nMultipling the first of these equations by sin^ 2 , and the second by -sin^ l , and\nthen adding, we produce the equation\n\nH\t\n\na\n\nH\n\ny sino 2 - a? sink = coswt sino\t\n1\t\n\n(1.3)\n\n2\n\n. t#\ns\nvt\n\n10\n\nSimilarly, by multipling the first of Equations (1.2) by cos^ 2 , and the second\nby -cosm l , and again adding, we have\n\nH\nH\t\ny\na cosh - az cosh = sinwt sink\t\n1\t\n\n(1.4)\n\n2\n\nSquaring Equations (1.3) and (1.4) and adding the results, yields\n\nH\n\n2\t\n\nH\n\na\n\n1\n\n2\t\n\n2tl tl\n\nZ\t\n\nY\t\n\ny `\n2\t\n\na\n\n2\n\ncosh = sin 2 ^\t\n\n(1.5)\n\nala2\n\n2\t\n\nwhere 0 = 02-yl.\nEquation (1.5) is a standard form of an ellipse. Any arbitrary elliptical\npolarization can be fully described by three properties: (a) the ratio of\nmajor to minor axis (axial ratio), (b) the angle which the major axis makes\nwith some reference axis (tilt angle), and (c) the sense of rotation of the\nvector generating the ellipse (Mayes, 1965).\nProperty (c), is determined by means of cycle counts, as discussed in\nSection 1.2. Properties (a) and (b) are illustrated in Figure 1.6, which\ndefines the lengths a ane b, and the angle V. We let tan g = a/b, which is\nthe ratio of major to minor axes, and we call ^ the tilt angle. Now by applying\na series of algebraic and trigonometric operations, we express tane and ^ as\nfunctions of the original variables (Kelso, 1950).

However, the phase shifters and attenuators\nshown in Figure 1.7 are designed to deal with relative quantities, as opposed\nto absolute quantities. The relative quantities can be obtained from the\ndefinition of the complex polarization vector, R, where\n\nR = ? = a e+J(02-^1) = peJ0 \t\nH\ny\t\n\n(1.8)\n\n1\n\nThis equation may be arrived at simply through transformation of the initial\ncosine terms of Equation (1.1) into exponentials. From Equation (1.8), we see\nthat there now exist only two variables o f interest, p and \xc2\xa2, where p is the\namplitude of the polarization vector, and 0 is the phase angle (Kelso, 1950).\nFrom here, we can see the convenience of simply selecting permanant values for\ntwo of the original variables. In other words, if we let a 1 = 1 and ^2 = 00\nin Equations (1.6) and (1.7), we lose no generality, since only the amplitude\nratio (a 2 /a,), and the phase difference (02 - ^ l ), are of interest. By changing the remaining two variables, a 2 and ^ 1 , any given eli-se can still be represented.\nSubstituting the permanent values of a l and ^\n\n\t Equations (1.6) and (1.7)\n\nbecome\n\n-2a2\ntan 2^ =\t\n1-a2\n\n2\n\ncosq,\t\n\n(1.9)\n\n\t\n\n13\n\nz\n\ns\t\nw\n\na\t\n\nJ W\nZ\t\nw a\t\n\tQ\n\ne\ncr\n\nm W\t\n^_^\t\n^2\t\n\nc\t\nE\t\n\n\t\n\ny W\n7a~\n^\xc2\xa21\t\n\nS\n\n^t F\n\nm\t\n\nm\n\nN\t\nn ^~\t\t\nU\t\n\n\tY\n\nN\n\ni\n7U\np\t\t ^ 7Y\n00\n\nQQ\nw\t\nZ\t\n\nJ\n\nm\t\t\nwao\n2a r1\t\n\nN\t\n\nm\t\n\n^\t\nw\n\no\t\n\nX\t\n\nO\n\n_\n\nQ J m\n\nwao\n2^n..\nJ\t a\n\nZ..o\t\nn ^I\t\n\nE J\t\n\nJ\t\n\nh\n\no\t\n0\n\n_\t\n\nE\n\no\t\n\nr0\n.4\n\nm\n\nz\n\n^\n\nJU\t\n\nJ\t\n1 N\nxO\t\n\nW\n_\t\n\nIJ\n\n^ 2Y\n^U\n\nro\n.O \xe2\x80\xa2r1\nro F.\n\xe2\x80\xa2^ ro\n\no\n\xc2\xa2o\nw\n^r\n\n\xc2\xa2o\t\nwm\t\n^r\t\n\nN ..\n\n>a\n\n--------------------N ----___\n------o---------\n\nQ) W\n\nN\t\n\nQJm\t\nW a \xc2\xb0\t\n2^r\t\n\nE\t\no\n\n-\t\n\nW\t\nN\n^\t\n\nm\t\n_\n\na w d 09\t\t\n\no\tf\na\t\n\nO\t\n\nm\t\n\nO\t\n\nO\n\nn\na\t\n\nOG w\ne\t o ; m O< m\t o~a\t VWi\n\xc2\xa2oa\t\nix \xc2\xb0 O j a\t\n-xaQ N\n\t a\nm\t\n\n\xc2\xb0\t\n7\t\n\nm\t\nO\t\n\nh\t\n\nI\t\n\nJ\t\n\ni\tpQ W\t\n\no \xc2\xa2= 4 M r\t\n*aS w\t\nfa\n\nme \xc2\xa2\n- Q4\t\n\nE\t\no\t\n\n-\t\n-\t\n\no\t\nw\t\n\nI\n\nJ\nyOJWN\nm\n\nzFaa\t\nO^\t\n\nN\no\t\na\t\n\nro as\n\nU b yJ\n\nP:\n\nW^u\t\n\nJ\t\n\nra-\t\n\nN\t\n>\t\n\ncr\n\nU\t\n\nro\t\n\na\t\n\nW\t\nx0\t\n\npu\t a\t f z\noz\na O \xc2\xa20\nOF\n\nD\t\nO\t\n\xc2\xa2\t\nV\t\n\xc2\xa2\t\n\nz=\t\n4J\nqZ\nu u\t\nW\t\nW W\nw\xc2\xa2 4 4~\nm\n\nE\t\n\na\t\n\nE\t\n\nZ W\t\n\np\t\np\t\n\nj\nO\t LL\t\n\nJOm\t\nap\xc2\xb0Om\t\n\xc2\xb0\nm 2 \'o\t\na o,\t\n\no w\t\nO r\t\n\nz\t\nO U\t\no\n\nn\t\ny-\t\n\nw\n\nE\t\n\nW\t\n\nO\n\n2\n\nma\t\n\nO\t\n\n\'q\' aU\t\n\nU\t\np\nJ\n\np\t\n\n=\t\n\np\n8\nO\t\n\nz\n\nx0\t\n\nW\nO\n\nOwm\nvi \xc2\xa2\no\n\nay\t\n\n..:\n\nQ\n\n^ W _ wa\nW j E w z\nm J O\n\no\t\n\n}\'I\n\n\xc2\xb0\t\n\nVI\n\no rc a\nN n\n\nU)\n\nN {J\nb ro\n\nX K .L\nU N 41\nO iJ\n.--I + - ) L^-4\nw ro O\nn\n\nN\n\nQ \xc2\xa2 ; Q Z\n\t\nw\nH\nF O J ^^\nf\n\nN\t\n\nN\t\n\nv a\nm\xc2\xa2\nO\n\nf W a\t\n\nm\np, i\t\n+ p\t\n\nZ\t\nW\t\n\n+^\n\nF+ VI G\nh0 F+ ro\nro O N\n\nf\nZ\n\n\xc2\xa2\t\n\nF-\t\n\nou\t\nOF\t\n\n\t\n\nE ct E\n\n---------------\n\n" \xc2\xa2\n------- N x\t\n\nJWm\t\n\nW\t\n\nV) m\n\n+J .0 v\n\n2\t\n\nKJM\t\n4\t\n\n>\t\n\n.L\n\nN3\n\nE\nm\n\nm\t\nm\t\n\nu\t\n\nw\n\na\n\nFW\t\n\n>\ni\t\nz\t\nW\t\nUl\t\np\t\nE\t\n--------\t ----r---\xc2\xb0------------m\t\nm\t\n\n~\t\n\nU\n\nG a ro\n\npNF\t\n\ny\t\n\nF W\t\n\n^\t\nW\t\n\nC\n\n2a a\n\npaa\t\n\no\t\n>\t\n\xc2\xa2\t\n\nU Q\t\n\nJ\n\nOL\n\n- Oaf \xc2\xa2\no\t\n\nNOW\t\n\nON_F __-- \t\n\n\t\n\n1J\n\nm\n\nNOW\t\n\nO\t\n\n4 3\n\nn\n\n-\n\n-\n\nJm\n\nXW\n\na\xc2\xb0 f^\n\n^Q\t\nO\n\nc3,oro _ a\nE\nm\n\na\t\n\n-\t\n\naan\t\nE\t\n_______________a\t\n\nE\n\na ^<\no\n\nh\n\nJ m\t\n\nE\t\no\t\n\n\xc2\xb0\t\n\nw>o\t\n\nUN\na\n\nU\n\nN\n\nfa a\n\nE\t\nm\xc2\xb0\t\n\na\t\n\xc2\xa2\n\ne\t\n\n^\n\ncd ,^\nO\nu\nH\n\nm\n\nE\n\nm O J N\t\n\xc2\xb0 Oat wi\t\nu\n\n\xc2\xa2\t\n\ncd O\n\nm\nN\n\n-\n\nF.\niJ\n\n,^ N\n\nN\t\n\n^\xc2\xb0 a\t\n\na\t o\n\na\n\na\n\n-\t\n\nOa 2\t\nO\t\n\nro\n\nH\n\n\tF-= W\na\n\na 0 +\na0\n\no\t\n\n\xc2\xb0\t\n\nb N\n\nA\nO\nN\n\nm\t\no\xc2\xb0\n-^\xc2\xb0 a\xc2\xb0 \t\nn\t\n\'D m\t\nN^\t\n^\t\n^u\t\n^ ^\t\n\nn\t\nu w\t\n\nm \xc2\xa2 m\t\n40O\t\n\xc2\xb0\n\' xa\t\nE\t\n\nr\t\nN\t\n\nJa\t\n\nE\t\nm\t\n\nQ J m\nWad\nzfr\nJa_\n\nL3+\n\nI.

Now, by substituting various values of a 2 and 0 (= -^ 1 ) into\nEquations (1.9) and (1.10), we can calculate the corresponding values of tano\nand ^. A set of values are tabulated in Table 1.1.\nExamining this table, we see an ambiguity in the value of axial ratio.\nThat is, the same value of tan g occurs for more than one combination of a 2 and\n^. However, all ambiguity may be eliminated by considering both the value of\ntan g and the value of ^ together. Even if the table were much more comprehensive and depicted far more values of a 2 and gyp, we would still see a unique one\nto one correspondance between (a) any given pair of quantities a 2 and ^, and\n\n(o) the corresponding combination of tilt angle (0) and axial ratio (tanO). It\nis this uniqueness that permits the development of a method to achieve circular\npolarization.\nAs an example of the method, let us turn our attention to the heavily outlined square of Table 1.1 which has ^ = 25\xc2\xb0 and tanO = 2.0. We immediately\nknow that the value of a 2 is 8/12 and the value of m is 60\xc2\xb0, since the uniqueness\ndescribed above forbids any other possible values of these variables. Therefore,\nwe at once know that we should decrease the attenuation of a 2 (thereby increasing\nits value toward 1.0), and increase the phase ^ (thereby increasing its value\ntoward 90\xc2\xb0). By repeated incremental changes of a 2 and m, we move from one\nsquare to another, getting nearer the center of the table with each movement.\nFinally, after a sufficient number of steps have been taken, we will have converged on the center square of the table, where we achieve an axial ratio of\n1.0. At this point, of course, we have circular polarization.\n\nW7\n\n15\n\nTable 1.1\t\n\nRelation between Elliptical Parameters and\n\nthe Phase -Amplitude Values of the Transmitted Signal\n^=45 ,\n\n\xc2\xa2=900\n\n0=1050\n\ny=120 0\n\n0=1350\n\ntan E1=\n\ntano=\n\ntune=\n\ntanO=\n\ntang=\n\n2.11\n\n2.00\n\n2.11\n\n2.48\n\n3.20\n\n16.60\n\n9.40\n\n0\xc2\xb0(180\xc2\xb0)\n\n170.60\n\n163.40\n\n158.00\n\n2.90\n26.80\n\n2.20\n22.20\n\n1.83\n8.50\n\n1.72\n(1\xc2\xb0(1800)\n\n1.53\n171.:\xc2\xb0\n\n2.20\n157.8\xc2\xb0\n\n2.90\n153.20\n\n2 .00\n30.1\xc2\xb0\n\n2, nu\n25 .0\xc2\xb0\n\n1.03\n16.0\xc2\xb0\n\n1.50\n00(1800)\n\n1.63\n164.(\'0\n\n2.00\n155.0\xc2\xb0\n\n2.66\n149.90\n\n9 112\n\n2.55\n33.10\n\n1.87\n30.S0\n\n1.48\n19.70\n\n1.33\n00(180-)\n\n1.48\n160.30\n\n1.87\n149.50\n\n2.55\n146.90\n\na2\n10112\n\n2.47\n38.00\n\n1.79\n35.50\n\n1.38\n27.80\n\n1.20\n00(1800)\n\n1.38\n152.20\n\n1.79\n144.5\xc2\xb0\n\n2.47\n142.00\n\na2\n11112\n\n2.43\n40.80\n\n1.75\n40.10\n\n1.33\n36.00\n\n1.09\n0\xc2\xb0(1800)\n\n1.33\n144.00\n\n1.7S\n139.90\n\n2.43\n139.20\n\nd2\n12112\n\n2.41\n45.00\n\n1.73\n45.00\n\n1.30\n45.00\n\n1.00\nnone\n\n1.30\n135.00\n\n1.73\n135.0\xc2\xb0\n\n2.41\n135.00\n\n14112\n\n2.46\nS0.70\n\n1.77\n53.30\n\n1.36\n61.00\n\n1.17\n90.00\n\n1.36\n119.00\n\n1.77\n126.70\n\n2.46\n129.30\n\na2\n16/12\n\n2.55\n5(\'.90\n\n1.87\n59.50\n\n1.48\n70.30\n\n1.33\n90.00\n\n1.48\n109.70\n\n1.87\n120.5\xc2\xb0\n\n2.55\n123.10\n\n18/12\n\n2.66\n59.90\n\n2.00\n65.00\n\n1.63\n74.00\n\n1.50\n90.00\n\n1.63\n106.00\n\n2.00\n115.00\n\n2.66\n120.10\n\na2\n20112\n\n2.86\n63.30\n\n2.13\n68.40\n\n1.79\n77.20\n\n1.67\n90.00\n\n1.79\n102.80\n\n2.13\n111.90\n\n2.86\n116.7\xc2\xb0\n\nd2\n22112\n\n3.04\n66.20\n\n2.32\n71.00\n\n1.95\n79.20\n\n1.83\n90.00\n\n1.95\n100.80\n\n2.32\n109.00\n\n3.04\n113.80\n\na2\n24/12\n\n3.20\n68.00\n\n2.48\n73.40\n\n2.11\n80.60\n\n2.00\n90.00\n\n2.11\n99.40\n\n2.48\n106.60\n\n3.20\n112.00\n\n6/12\n\na2\n7/12\na2\n8/12\na2\n\na2\n\n_\n\na2\n\ny=750\n\ntang=\n\ntang=\n\n3.20\n\n2.48\n\n22.0 0\n\na2 =\n\n0 =600\n\nI\n\nFE\n\n1()\n\nNote that the values of ^ all lie between the limits of 0\xc2\xb0 and 180\xc2\xb0.

RESULTS OF POLARIZATION TESTS ON\nR01 7hET SHOTS NO. 14.360 AND 14.361\ni\nBasic polarization tests were made during two of the rocket shots at\nWallops \'sland, Virginia, on July 24, 1968. Polarization results determined\nfrom the chart records of those sho t s are presented in this section.\nF\n2.1 Nature of the Testin\nChanges in the settings of the manual attenutors and phase shifters of\nFigure 1.7 were made during the flights of rockets 14.360 an-i 14.361. \t\n\nIn order\n\nfor these tests to be meaningful, they were not performed until after 10 seconds\nhad elapsed, allowing for all possible transients, due to the take-off, to have\ndiminished. Also, t-) be perfectly sure that the tests would not interfer with\ndata which is taken immediately upon entry into the ionosphere, all tests were\nterminated after 40 seconds had elapsed. (This approximate 30-second limitation\non the testing period must, for the same reasons, hold for any system developed\nto produce circular polarization.)\nPre-flight calibrations were made in the manner already described in Section\n1.2. On rocket 14.360, after approximtely 10 seconds, the extraordinary mode\nwas attenuated and the ordinary allowed to propagate. The attenuator and phase\nshifter controlling the ordinary were then moved from their pre-flight settings.\nThese changes were made to allow us to note the corresponding variations in the\namplitude and phase of the receiver output, using the output from the magnetic\naspect sensor on the rocket as a phase reference. At approximately 25 seconds\nof elapsed time, the ordinary ws- attenuated and the extraordinary was transmitted. The same type of changes were made on its corresponding attenuator and\nphase shifter until the elapsed time of approximately 40 seconds. At this time,\nboth modes were once more restored to their pre-flight power levels, and all\n\n,1\n\nmss\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\x94 -\n\nx\n\n18\n\npre-flight attenuator and phase-shifter settings were also restored. The sane\nmanner of testing was used on 14.361, with the exception that the order in which\nthe modes were transmitted was reversed.\n2.2 Testing Limitations\nOnly the manual attenuators and phase shifters, shown in Figure 1.7, were\nin use during the time of this testing. These devices are restricted in the\nsense that the phase shift and attenuation are mutually dependent. That is to\nsay, by merely changing the setting of (for example) the attenuator alone, a\nchange in phase shift is simultaneously introduced (the converse being also true).\nThere is no simple relation governing this mutual dependence, and therefore no\neasy way of knowing beforehand, the exact change which takes place. Some elaborate method of point by point measurement would be required to predict the changes,\nand this would be highly tedious and impracticable. It is for this reason that\nthe tests conducted could not be used as a means of checking, the calculated variations of tilt angle and axial ratio Kith respect to attenuation and phase as\ndiscussed in Section 1.3\nIt is evident that the data from only two rocket shots can not reveal all\nthe effects of such things as time of day, weather conditions, or variations in\ndifferent rocket receivers without further testing. However, the following\nsection describes the conclusions drawn from the two tests which were conducted.\n2.3 Results of the Testi\n2.3.1 The Presence of Standing Naves\nRocket shot 14.360 was conducted at 12:00 noon EST and rocket shot 14.361\nat 4:36 PM EST.

Taking note of the respective times of da y , we\nattribute the phenomenon to the existance of standing waves. This conclusion\nis based on the fact that the extra peaks did not occur regularly at any multiple\nof the rocket roll rate (as shown in Figure 2.1), and are therefore thought to\nstem from an external source.\nSince D-region absorption is larger near noontime (when 14.360 was launched)\nthan at 4 PDi (when 14.361 was launched), it is reasonable to conclude that refleeted signals were sufficiently strong to set up standing waves at 4 PD1 but\nnot at noon. We therefore attribute the multiple peaks which occurred in the\nchart record of 14.361 to the existance of these standing waves.\n2.3.2 Signal Distortion\nIt was also found, that at times (independent of the particular mode propagating) the signal from the receiver was distorted as shown in the left and center\nportion of Figure 2.2. We attribute this to a slow reacting AGC system in the\nreceiver itself. This explanation is plausible since the frequencies we are\ndealing with are in the 5 to 10 Hz range. The figure shows that the distortion\ndiminishes as the polarization is corrected, that is, as the amplitude of the\nsinusoid is decreased. Based on this fact, we deem it highly improbable that,\nafter the pre-flight polarization adjustment of both modes, the polarization\nwould even be bad enough to have this distortion become appreciable.\n\n22\n\n3. THE POLARIZATION CORRECTION SYSTEM\n\n3.1 Qualitative Analysis\nWe have established in Section 1.3 that apparatus capable of determining\nthe tilt angle, ^, and the corresponding axial ratio for elliptical polarization,\n\n/\t\n\nis a necessary part of a system able to correct elliptical polarization. This\npart of the system would be required to determine in which of the four quadrants\nof Table 1.1 the tilt angle occurs. For example, a value of ^ found to be within the range 0\xc2\xb0 < ^ < 45\xc2\xb0, must necessarily occur in the upper left quadrant of\nTable 1.1, and only in that quadrant. Once the quadrant is determined, the\nremainder of the system must be able to appropriately increase (or decrease)\nboth the amplitude a 2 , and the value of the angle, ^. Such a system would be\nable to correct any elliptical polarization to a more circular polarization.\nA system which is capable of these functions consists of the four !`lacks\nof circuitry shown in Figure 3.1. Block one zonditions the signal from the\nmagnetic aspect sensor (MA), and block two does the same for the rocket receiver signal. They are conditioned in such a manner, that when connected\nthrough the logic circuitry of block three, they form a signal which can\ncorrectly drive the incrementation circuitry of block four. The MA signal is\nused as a phase reference with which the phase of the signal from the rocket\nreceiver can be compared. It should be noted, that the phase of the magnetic\naspect signal (assuming that the rocket does not precess about a field line)\nis directly related to the fixed coordinate system defined in Figure 1.6.\nThis coordinate system is determined by the orientation of the transmitting\nantenna array located on the ground and the known direction of the geomagnetic\nfield vector. \'Therefore, the MA signal does indeed qualify as a valid phase\nreference.\n\n.^\t\n\nOr\t\n\nd\n\n23\n\nD\nO\n\nch\t\nD\nO\t\n\nZ\nO\n\nW Q\n^?

We then work with the rocket receiver signal, each period of\nwhich we transform into a signal pulse occurring only at the point where the\nmaximum of the signal had occurred. This pulse is designated by the letter\nC in Figure 3.2. Now by corm^aring this pulse with signals representing the four\nquadrants, via logic circuitry, we are able to determine the quadrant of\noccurrence of the pulse (and thus of the maximum). In this manner we determine\nthe quadrant location of ^. Ile are then left with four distinct outputs (one\nfor each quadrant) which are fed in appropriate combinations into two, dual\ninput voltage incrementation circuits. These circuits perform the function\nof either raising or lowering their respective output voltages by incremental\namounts.\nLet us clarify this point by means of a specific example. Suppose that\nthe receiver pulse is found to occur in the upper left quadrant of \'fable I.I.\nSubsequent logic circuitry transmits the pulse and combines it with that corresponding quadrant as determined from the PIA signal. This combination is made\nin such a manner as to cause one incrementar circuit (labeled "attenuator"\nin Figure 3.2) to lower its output voltage. In a like manner, it zau::es the\noutput voltage of the other incrementor circuit (labeled "phase shifter") to\nbe raised.\t\n\nThese voltages then, are the desired final outputs of the system,\n\nand are intended to be used as inputs to a current controlled attenuator and a\nvoltage controlled phase shifter respectively. The attenuator, in turn, operates\ndirectly on the quantity a 2 (of "Table 1.1), and the phase shifter operates on\n^.

Thus the value of a 2 is increased toward 1.0 (by having its\nattenuation decreased), and the value of 4 is increased toward 90\xc2\xb0, since the\nattenuation and phase shift are directly proportional to the output voltages\nof their respective incrementor circuits. Now, of course, we are nearer to\ncircular polarization (nearer to the center of Table 1.1). The system operates as a closed loop until the best possible polarization has been achieved.\nAt this point, the system can be disengaged, with the two final values of a2\nand Q controlling the transmitted signal for the duration of the rocket flight.\n3.2 Quantitative Analysis\n3.2.1 Magnetic Aspect Signal Conditioner\nNow that the overall operation of tFe system has been outlined, let us\nexamine in detail each of the blocks of the diagram shown in Figure 3.1. We\nbegin by considering block one, which conditions the signal of the magnetic\naspect sensor.\nThe 14A signal has a frequency equal to that of the rocket roll rate, but\nthe signal from the rocket receiver, being elliptical in nature, has an effective\nfrequency of two times the roll g ate. Therefore, in order to make the two\nsignals have a one to one correspondence, the frequency of the MA signal must\nbe doubled. The doubler must introduce no variation in phase over the frequency\nrange of the rocket. roll (since the accurate relative phase relationship of the\nsignals involved contains the required information). Also, the frequency\ndoubler must maintain a constant output amplitude. An AGC system is included\nfor this purpose.\n\n^\t\n\n7\n\nr\n\n27\n\nOnce having doubled the frequency of the MA signal and having rendered\nit constant in amplitude, we "quadrantize" it (i.e. divide it into four equal\nparts). This is done by first separating the doubled signal into two parts.\n\t\n\nOne part is fed directly into the FET Schmitt trigger configuration of Figure\n\nF\n\n3.3. This trigger was designed specifically to eliminate all effects of\nhysteresis, and therefore trigger symmetricall\n\ny\n\nand\n\n:is\n\nnearly a! : possible to\n\nthe zero crossing of the incoming sinusoidal waveform. The AGC sy stem of the\nfrequency douhlcr is a great aid in accomplishing; these results. With constant\ninput amplitude, she circuit of Figure 3.3 always triggers at exactly the same\npoint.\nThe 4.7 ks resistor in the figure determines the loop gain of the circuit\nand controls hysteresis. With this particular value of resistance, hysteresis\nis a minimum as shown by the input and output waveforms of the trigger, photographed in Figure 3.4a. In contrast, Figure 3.4b shows the input and output waveforms with R = 6.8 kE;. The undesirability of the latter output waveform\nwill become evident later when its application is discussed. The 1\n\nO\n\nF capaci-\n\ntor also shown in Figure 3.3 is used as a speed-up capacitor, enabling us\n\nto\n\nattain the fastest possible rise times in triggering.\nThe same doubled MA signal is simultaneousl y fed into an integrating\namplifier which, in turn, is followed by another Schmitt trigger. However,\nonce having integrated the signal (basically by means of a capacitor) the\noutput amplitude of the integrating circuit will necessarily vary with frequency,\nthus making it very difficult to design an ordinary Schmitt trigger for s y mmetrical triggering. Therefore, it was decided that packaged integrated\ncircuits would be used for triggering.. The reason for this will be illustrated\nin Figure 3.8b which shows that switching (for the type 7100 integrated circuit\n\na\n\nr" -\n\nYc\n\nc..\n\n.\n\nMt \' ^\xe2\x80\x94 re "\n\n\t\n\nr\nd\t\n\n1}\t\n\n.\n\nf\n\n28\n\nQH\nO\ncrW\n\n0\nCD\nX\nH\n\noa\n.c\nY\nN\nG\n\nN\n\n:J\n11\n\nM\nM\nU\nt+\nc{\n\nQ\n\nZ\nx\nN\n\n(a,\n\n(b)\n\nrigure 3.4 (a) Photograph of the sinusoidal input and square output from\nthe FET Schmitt trigger shown in Figure 3.3, and (b) a sketch\nindicatin\xe2\x80\x9e the result of hysteresis.\n\n_\xe2\x99\xa6\nn`\t\n\n{\'\t..\nF\n\n^\'\n\n:^{\t\n\n\'l 1. i\'\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n^\n\nS\n\n30\n\nwhich was selected) occurs within one millivolt of the zero crossing of the\ninput signal, thus insuring symmetry regardless of the variations of input\namplitude. Another IC package, the 702C (shown with its connections in Figure\n,.5), was chosen for purposes of integration and amplification. It has two\npossible inputs (terminals 2 and 3), one of which inverts and the other does\nnot. We select the inverting input (terminal 2) in order to achieve a positive\ncosine waveform from the input sine wave through the dual processes of integration and amplification (as shown in the photograph displayed in Figure 3.6).\nAmplification is accomplsihed via the 150 kn feedback resistor, and integration\nby means of the 1 uF capacitor (Figure 3.5). These particular values make the\noverall gain for the 702C approximatel y 1/3, which is purposely low in order\nto insure that any subsequent IC circuitry will never be overdriven. The\n0.1 uF capacitor in terminal 6 of the device acts as a frequency compensator,\nwith this particular value of capacitance causing the 702C to roll off at a\nfrequency (20-30 kHz) well beyond the frequency range of the doubled rocket\nroll rate.\nThe 702C is followed by a Schmitt trigger in the form of another integrated circuit, type 7100. This 710C is li-t\xc2\xb0d as basically a differential\nvoltage comparator intended for applications requiring high accurac y and fast\nresponse time--making it the ideal device for our present needs. The connections\nmade to the device are illustrated in Figure 3.7. The package runs on the\nsame bias voltages (*12 and -6) as the 702C of Figure 3.S, and thus, ir, itself,\nrequires no e.:tra power supplies. For this device the roles of terminals 2\nand 3 are reversed with respect t., the 702C, so that having our input at\nterminal 3, we again achieve inversion. This results in the overall input-output\nwaveforms (for the combination of integration arid triggering) photographed\n\n^L\t\n\n^-\n\n31\n\n^^\nL F\xe2\x80\x94\nD\n\nO\n\nL\nQ\n4+\nG\n.ti\ncL\n\nN\n\nC\nLLC\n\nb\n\nF+\n\nCJ N\n/\n\n;w\n\nV)i\n\n:J ti\n\n^ E\n\nn cd\n\nr7\n:J\nF+\nOG\nCi.\n\nM\nCL\nZ\n\n0\n\nwL\t\n\n#\t\n\ns\n\n32\n\nr0\n4J\nm\nN\n^a\nw\n0\n\nu\n\nN\nO\n\nr\n\nW\nO\n\nO\n6\nN\na\n-)\n0\n0\na^\nx\nb\n\nG\n\nm Ln\na^\n> a^\n\nO N\na w\nm o0\n\nw\na ^\n\na^+\n\nG\na: o\n\na^\nN\n\nw\n\n_\t\n\n^\t\n\n^TL\'\t\n.,r `^\'t.--+\n\nfit`-\t\n\n^5..\t\n\n^:r.\t\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\n^- \xe2\x80\xa2.\t\n^^ ^\n\n;lL\n\nr\n\n33\nr\n\nD\n\nF-Z)\n\nO\n\nN\nc\n\nw\nc\nc.\n\nv\nc\ns.\ny\n\nc0\nH\n\nN\nG\nt\nU\n\nC\\\n\nT\n\nro\n\nrl\nr^\nN;\n\nbfi\nC.L.\n\n1\n\nI^\n\nZ\n\niti\n\n34\n\nand displayed in Figure 3.8a. The input wave in this photograph is identical\nto the input wave in Figure 3.4a. Therefore, a visual comparison of the\nsquared outputs of both figures can now he made, showing that the combined\ntriggering points appear at the boundaries of the conventionall y defined 90\xc2\xb0\nquadrants of a sine wave.\nNow we have to combine these two square wave outputs so that we can differentiate between the four quadrants. We do so by first defining the upper\nhorizontal levels of either square 1^%, ave (Figures 3.4a and 3.8a) as the onestate and the lower horizontal levels as the zero-state. Now our terminology\nis applicable directly to logic circuitry, which we will use to combine these\nwaves. The logic we will use is in the form of nor-gates.\t\n\nThe device con-\n\ntaining these gates is the MC!\'\'4P, which contains four such gates in one\npackag_. \'17.ie gates are shown individually in 3.2 (the package is not shown)\nand require a +3.6 volt supply for biasing pur p oses. Now, let us designate\nthe output of the FET trigger by the letter A, and the output of the IC circuitry by the letter B. Then we can go directly back to Figure 3.2 and observe\nthe actual interconnetion of A and B through the nor-logic. The result of\nthese interconnections are the outputs labeled 1, 2, 3 and 4 in the Figure.\n\xe2\x80\xa2These outputs ire then negated and labeled ,,l, tit, ti3 and %4. Photographs\nof these four negated outputs of the nor-gates are displayed in Figure 3.9.\nAll four are shown in relation to the doubled MA signal which is displayed in\neach picture. Therefore, by definition of the quadrant boundaries of a sine\nwave at its peaks and zero crossings, we see that these quadrants correspond\nrespectively to the negated square waveforms produced by the logic. Thus,\nwe have accomplished the separation of the doubled sinuisoidal MA signal into\nfour quadrants. \'I\'he signal is now "quadrantized".\n\nWT\n\n\t\n\nM\nrl\t\n\n^\t\n\n_\n\n\t\n\n3S\n\n(a)\n\n4\n\n3\nti\n\nO\n\n2\n9\n\n^ I\n>o\n\n0\n_ I I\t\n-5 -3\t\nI\t\n\nI\t\n\n1\t\n\n1\n\n0\n\n3 5\n\nVin (MV)\n(b)\n\nFigure 3.8 (a) The sinusoidal input and square output from the 710C\nconfiguration shown in Figure 3.7, and (b) the transfer\ncharacteriAic for the 710C. \t\n\nW\n\n3\n\n36\n\nw N\nO 2\n7\n\n^\n\na\n\n-. 0 2\nh\nv ca\nco\n\n0010\n0\nr r,\na^\n\nN\n\n.n\n\no r,\nw\n\nw\n\n> c\n}J {r N\nU \'L7\nQ) cd M\nG.

Fhis is the waveform of primary interest,\nsince it contains the actual polarization information. The basic shape of\nthis signal is sinusoidal (as discussed in Section 1.3), and it is of the same\nfrequency as the output of the 61A signal\'s frequency doubler. Therefore, we\nmust find the quadrant location (using the quadrants Just developed) of the\nmaximum of this sinusoidal wave and thus, in effect, find the quadrant location\nof the tilt angle V.\nSince our reference quadrants have already been defined, we must now\nfind the maximum of the rocket receiver signal and determine its quadrant\nlocation.\t\n\nThe actual circuitry which was developed to convert the signal\n\nof the rocket receiver into single pulses occurring only at the maxima of that\nsignal, begins with the impedance matching circuitry .shown in Figure 3.10.\nAgai:i FETs are used, and the rocket receiver\'s high output impedance is matched\nto the much lower input impedance of subsequent circuitry. Figure 3.10 also\nshows an LC filter, a low-pass filter capable of suppressing any possible\ninterfering signals of frequencies greater than a few hundred Hz. For this\npurpose the values of L and C were chosen such that the corresponding "break\npoint" in the straight line Bode plot for the filter (Figure 3.12) occurs\nat 65 Hz (w ti 408rps). Thus any frequency in the range of the doubled MA signal\nwould be j. -\xc2\xb0d totally unimpeded vot interfering signals in the few hundred Hz range, would be suppressed. nor an illustration, I\xe2\x80\xa2igure 3.11 shows two\nphotographs each containing input and output waveforms of the filter.

For this, we use\n\nanother 702C, connected as in Figure 3.13. Here we use on!v a resistor in\nthe feedback line since we require only amplification and not integration as\nwe\'. l. The 100 UL resistor chosen for feedback. produced an oti=2rall gain for\nthe device of approximatel y 25/1. it might be noted here, that a major purpose\nf\'or using this integrated circuit for amplification is impedance matching with\nsubsequent integrated circuitry.\nThe next requirement is internal phase shifting within the system itself.\nWe require an adjustable phase shift to compensate for; (a) anv possible constant\nphase shift attributable to the frequency doubler or other previous circuitry,\n(b) the phase difference between the set of quadrants derived from the MA signal\nand that from the fixed coordinate s y stem (Figure 1.6) determined b y the groundbased antenna array and (c) any constant phase shift developed within the\npolarization correction s y stem itself. Therefore, the phase shifter should be\n%ariable over the entire 360\xc2\xb0 range to ensure a capabilit y of ccning with all\npossible combinations of the above phase shifts. We begin by squaring the\nsinusoidal receiver signal (which has thus far been filtered and amplified) by\nmeans of another 710C, connected in the same fashion as the one in Figure 3.7.\t\nA )hotograph of the input and the resulting square output waveforms of this\ndevice is shown in Figure 3.14.\n\nr^\n\ni\n\n42\n\nFZ)\na0\n\nY\n0\n\n0\nY.\n\nUQ- U\n\nZJ\n\nar\n\n43\n\n^\n\n1\t\n\nc\n0\n\nI\n\nI\n\nc.\nEic\nw\nc\n0\nu\nc,\n\n0\nr0\n\nw\n0\n\n.a1\n\ni=\nyI\nI\t\n\n0\n\n_I_I\n\nh\n\nI\n\n^\n\n:n\n\n^\t\n\nc\n\n1\n\nc\n\nt^\n\nM\n\naN\nc :3\n^^ x\nc^\n\n\'v c\n0\nIn\n\n-\n\nC\n\na 3\n\ntn\n\nf\nH\n\nM\n\nV\nI\n\n1\t\n\nI\n\nLL\n\n44\n\nOnce having a square wave, we are able to integrate it so that we obtain\na basicall y triangular waveform. For integration purposes, we again turn to\nanother 702C (Figure 3.15). In this case, we adjust the RC feedback to obtain\nan output sufficiently triangular in shape, and ,vet of large enough magnitude\nto give an appreciable peak-to-peak voltage differential. The 2 k2 resistor\nand 20 uF capacitor in Figure 3.14 were selected for this purpose. A photograph of the input and output waveforms for the device is displa yed in\nFigure 3.16.\nWe now use this triangular waveform to drive another 710C. However, this\ntime, instead of grounding the unused input terminal (M2) as we have done\npreviously, we connect it to a do bias-potentiometer combination as shown in\nFigure 3.17. The 710C, as a device, is made to trigger solely on the difference\nin potential between its two input terminals. Therefore, by use of the negative\n6-volt do supply connected to one end of a 1 kR potettiometer in Figure 3.17,\nwe are able to vary the pot^ntial on terminal 2 from 0 volts to -6 volts. Thus,\nwe can obtain either an upward or downward triggering at every (phase) point of\nthe triangular .ave. For example, if the 710C triggers at a 3 volt differential\n5etween inputs, and the triangular waveform ranges from 0 to -2 volts peak-topeak, by adjusting the potentiometer so terminal 2\'s voltage ranges continuously\nfrom -3 to -S volts dc, we have either a positive or a negative triggering at\nevery possible position in the 360\' period of the triangular wave. By making\nthe peak-to-peak voltage differential of the triangular signal quite large,\nwe obtain a facility in distinguishing between two phases relatively close\nto one another. Photogra p hs of two possible levels of triggering are shown\nin Figure 3.18. By simply projecting the vertical lines of the square waves\nupward, one can see the point (level) of the triangular input signal at which\nthe 710C is , ztually triggering.\n\nI\n\n\t\n\n- ;\t\n\n{\n\t\n\n\t\nFS\n\nrte_ r-\t\n\nl\n\n45\n\n7D\nd\n\nD\nQ\n\na\nc\nx\nk\nu\n\nc\nL\n4i\n4+\n\nE\nC\n^\tF+\nW\nY\nG\n\nrr^\n\nC\n\'l.\n\nro\n\nv;\n\n:J\nN\n\nn\n^ rr^^\nr\n\nr^\n\nV\n\n^Ucr-\n\nZU)~\n\nV\n\n46\n\nl\nU\nN\n\nO\n\nn\n\na^\nX\n\nv\n\nw\n0\nv\na\n\na\n0\nF,\n\noo^,\n\nM\nN N\na\n00 00\n.4\n\nci\n\na^\n~0\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nv .rc^\n\nm\n\nN\n\na\n\n0\n\na. +J\na^\n^4-4\nV)\n\nNi\na^\n\nw\n600\n\nu\n\nrw\xe2\x80\x94;\n\n47\n3\n\nn^\n\nCL\n\nO\n\nN\nG\nK\n\nW\nC\n.ti\n4\xe2\x80\xa2\nFr\n\nG\n\n1l\npG\n7fi\n\n4+\n4+\n\nE\nL\n:J\n\nN\n\nC.1\n\nct\n\nV)\nQ)\ntA\n:J\nr\n\nn\nr7\nC1\ni.\n7G\ne\n\nL\'\n\ny\n\nf\'\\\t\n\n1\n\n^Z C\n\nQ z /Oy\n\ny x\n1.\n\nA\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 3.18 Triangular input and resulting squa_e output to the 7100\nconfiguration of Figure 1.17 with the potentiometer set to \t\ntrigger at a level equal to (a) approximatel y 3/1 the peak\nvalue and (b) 1/3 the peak value of the triangular waveform.\n\ne\n\n49\nz\n\nTable 3.1 illustrates the phase shifts which result from corresponding\nsettings of the potentiometer. \'lhe letters R and W refer to the two poles of\na double- pole\'double-throw switch. This switch selects either the _,)ward or\nthe downward triggering points of the 710C (both of which are needed to cover\nthe full 360 0 range). As shown in the table, there are six potentiometer settings which read "none". These occur in two groups of three, and represent the\npoints where the upward and the downward triggering points become very close to\none another and finally merge together. in these intervals, the triggering\npoints are not clearly defined, and therefore they cannot be used for purposes\nof precise phase shifting. As stated, tie pi,sse shifter is user: to compensate\nfor the total constant phase shift resulting from the sources mentioned\nearlier. Once this total phase shift has been measured for a given antenna array,\nand for the given circuitry, it remains constant. \'llierefore, the phase shift\nrequired of the system can be predeterui.ned once and for all, and the potentiometer set to the corresponding value for all subsi-quent rocket shots. However,\nshould this value happen to be near one of the six "none" entries of Table :,.1,\nthe 10 ohm resistor leading into terminal 3 of the 710C in Figure 3.17 can be\nchanged, thereby changing the do level of the entire triangular wave, and accordingl; shifting the potent i ometer settings such that the required value of phase\nshift can be obtained.\nNow, the square wave output of the 7100 is differentiated by means of a\nsimple RC differentiation circuit. A photograph of the differentiated signal\nis shown in Figure 3.19.\t\n\nThis sequence of positive and negative spikes is\n\ncompared with the original rocket receiver signal in the photograph displayed\nin Figure 3.20. We transform these spikes into pulses via two separate irgating configurations.

Its other input terminal\nis grounded, y ielding only negative going pulses where the positive spikes had\noccurred. The second configuration consists of a nor-gate which receives the\nspikes after the y have been positivel y biased. This biasing transforms the\nnegative spikes to a voltage level such that they yield a zero-state at the\noutput, while all remaining portions of the spiked waveform generate a onestate. Thus the total output appears as positive pulses, which are then\nnegat?d to y ield negative pulses occurring only where the negative spikes had\noccurred. We are able to choose between the positive and the negative\nspikes by means of the double-pole double-throw switch. Thus, whichever position of the switch we choose, we receive one negative pulse per cycle as the\noutput of the respective gating configuration.\nOne pole of the switch is red and designated b y the letter R in \':able\n3.1. ibis pole selects the configuration which yields a pulse at the location\nof the positive spike. The other pole is white and designated b y the letter\nh. it is associated with the negative spike. To illustrate, Figure 3.21\nshows the results of the two gating configurations when the same spikes of\nFigure 3.20 are-used as the input to both. Figure \';.21a results when the\nswitch is in the "R" position, and Figure 3.21b, when in the "IC position\n3.2.3 Logic Circuitry\nNow we have accomplished our intended p urpose, namely, resolved the\nsignal from the rock-_ receiver into a pulse (labeled - k C in Figure 3.:-, ) which\ncan be made to occur at the maximum of that signal. By combining this pulse\nin the correct manner with the previousl y developed four quadrants of the NIA\nsignal, we are able to determine in which of these quadrants the pulse occurs.\n\n54\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 3.21 Pulses formed from the spikes shown in Figure 3.20 through norgating. The double pole, double throw switch is in the (a) red\nposition and (b) white positicn.\n\n55\n\nThis is accomplished b y the further use of nor-gates (represented by\nblock three of Figure 3.1). The "negative" quadrants established (labeled\n,^1, ti2, ^-3 and A in Figure 3.2) are each one input of four different nor-gates.\nThe other input of each gate is \'^C, and the respective four outputs of these\ngates are designated by the numerals I, II, III and IV in Figure 3.2, (the\nRoman numerals proceed from their corresponding Arabic numeraled quadrants).\nThese four outputs consist of a pulse per cycle occurring only at that Roman\nnumerated output in whose respectivel y numbered quadrant the maximum of the\nrocket receiver signal occurred. Therefore, at any, given interval of time,\none of these outputs takes the form of a pulse per cycle, while the other three\noutputs are zero.\nIrtius, by connecting the four output terminals to appropriate input terminals of circuits ca p able of changing the attenuation and phase, we correct the\npolarization. The circuitr y needed to do this consists of two "voltage incrementor" circuits (block four of Figure 3.1). One of these is shown in Figure\n3.22, the other being an exact duplicate. It is a deal input circuit, which\ntransforms incoming pulses into an increasing or decreasing do voltage\nlevel. A pulse on the terminal labeled positive increment in Figure 3.22,\nwill increase the charge on the 1.5 uF output capacitor for the duration of\nthe pulse. A similar pulse on the negative increment terminal will do the\nsame thing in reverse (i.e. decrease the charge on C). The RC time constants\nfor both the increasing and the decreasing inputs have been made the same for\npurposes of uniform incrementation in hoth the positive and negative directions.\nThe value selected is 30 ms (found by taking the product of two 10 kQ resistors\nin series and the 1.5 uF capacitor). Thus it takes approximately 30 ms for\nthe capacitor to attain a voltage equal to about 2/3 that of the supply voltage\n\n56\n\n(in our case 2/3 x 6 volts = 4 volts). The period, T, of course, i^; inversely\nproportional to the frequency, and therefore variable over the frequency of\nrocket roll. However, the value of T affects both the size of the increments\nand their fre q uency of occurrence--the two tending to have a cancelling effect\non one another. \'I1ierefore, the total time to achieve an y desired voltage change\nis very nearly frequency independent. One more point must be made in discussing\nthe circuit of Figure 3.22. With a 1.5 uF capacitor at its output, if we want\nthe output voltage to remain constant for the duration of the rocket flight\n(approximately 500 seconds), the effective impedance which will parallel this\ncapacitor (as determined by the load) should be sufficiently large in order\nto not drain the capacitor appreciably during this interval.\nAs stated, the outputs of these two incrementor circuits are intended for\nuse in a current controlled attenuator and a voltage controlled phase shifter.\nThese are the respective devises labeled "variable" in Figure 1.7, and their\ntransfer characteristics are shown in Figure 3.23. Thus as the voltage output\nfrom the incrementor circuitry is altered, the attenuation on a 2 and the phase\nangle I in the transmitting signal can be changed according to the curves of\nFigure 3.23. In summary, the rocket receives a signal from the transmitter;\nthat signal is fed through the system and transformed into a pulse at the\noccurrence of the signal\'s maximum; the phase relation of that pulse is determined in terms of the quadrants of the MA signal; knowing the operations which\nhave to be performed on a., and ^ to make the polarization more circular, the\nattenuation and phase shift of the transmitteO signai are changed accordingly;\nwith this new attenuation and phase shift, a different signal with a more circular polarization is transmitted; the rocket receives the new signal from the\n\n57\n\n+6V\n\nPOST,\nINCRE\n\nN\nIN\n\nFigure S.22 Voltage iii,. -rementation circuit.\n\n58\n\n25\nm\n\n20\t\n\n--\n\nz\n15\nz 10\n5\n0\n\na\n\n0\t .5\t 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5\nCURRENT INPUT (mA )\n\nQ)\n\nv\n\n0\n\n-60\nU-\n\n-120\nW\n\nUj -180\nQ\n_ -240\n0 10 ?Cl 30 40 50\na-\t\nVOLTAGE INPUT (VOLTS)\nFigure 3.23 Transfer characteristics of proposed (a)\ncurrent controlled attenuator and (b)\nvoltage controlled phase shifter.\n\n59\n\ntransmitter, and the prccess is repeated. \'I\'he process continues in this closed\nloop fashion until the polarization is circular, as required.\n3.2.4 Testing of the System\nAfter the circuitry was completely breadboarded and functioning properly,\nthe system was tested b y means of telemetry data from rockets 14.360 and 14.361\n(discussed in Section 2). By replaying the tapes from these shots, we were able\nto simulate the actual rocket flights. During the tests, four signals were\nrecorded, the doubled magnetic aspect sensor signal, the receiver output and the\noutputs of the polarization correction system (the voltage outputs of the incrementation circuits which led to the variabl: phase shifter and the attenuator).\nThe internal phase shift of the system itself was pre-set for 90\xc2\xb0 to\nI\n\ndetect the maxima directly (i.e. no compensating phase shift was pre-set into\nthe system). When the recorded signals were analyzed, we observed the distortion in the rocket receiver signal as a result of the slow reacting AGC\nsystem (as discussed in Section 2). Thus, in order to determine the location\nof the maximum within the distorted waveform, we had to find one point of the\nwave which was never distorted by the AGC. That poin- is at the occurrence of\nthe downward sloping zero crossing , as shown in Figure 3.24. 71lerefore, for\npurposes of data analysis we located the maximum by measuring the amount T;4\n(Figure 3.24) back from the correctly phased zero crossing. Upon comparing\nthis point to the doubled NIA signal, we visuall y determined the quadrant \' _ation of the maxima, and were thus able to predict how the system outputs should\nb- -esponding. Checking these predictions with the actual recorded outputs,\nwe found that they agreed in all cases throughout both rocket shots. Figures\n3.25 and 3.26 show two typical segments of the recorded test results, depicting\nthe responses of the system to the occurrence of the maximum in the second and\nthird quadrants respectively.\n\n00\n\n.j\nu\n\nC a\n0 0\n\nQ)\nN\n\nt\n\n0 N U*)\n4-j cd\n\nU\n\nw > >.\ncC t+ \xe2\x80\xa2,\nU 0\no >\nC U\n\nb\n0\n\xc2\xab.+\n\nro s4 41\n\n..+\nU\nLn\n\noc\nc, U ru\n\n>^ C\no N\n\nU\n\n^\n\nU\n\nC x,\n\nti\n\nN\n\nU ro o\n4- c.\n\nc\n0\n.,I\n+\xe2\x80\xa2r\nu\n(1)\nN\nU\nb\n\n4^ 4J\no u)\n\nv -a\n\nO\n\nC U\na\nC\n\nw^ C\n\nO\n\nC\n\n+J\nC O cJ CC\n\nLn\n\nf t+ m\nO\nN\n\nL4 N U O\nU in v) f4\n\nU\t\nrJ J\t\n\nG.

INTRODUCTION\n\nThis section briefly describes a radio propagation experiment\ndeveloped at the University of Illinois for the measurement of lower\nionosphere electron densities.\nThe general concept of the experiment is discussed by Bowhill\n(1965), the engineering details by Knoebel, et al. (1965), and by Gooch,\net al. (1966), and a method of data analysis by Meclitly, et al. (1967).\nThese works are briefly reviewed in this section. Following sections\nanalyze the experiment, the data processing system, and the method of\nanalysis.\n1.1 Rocket Studies of the Lower Ionosphere\n\nThe physical and chemical processes taking place in the ionosphere,\nthe upper atmosphere betu^!en 50 and 1000 km altitude, have acquired the\nname "aeronomy" in recent years. The aeronomy of the ionosphere above\n100 km is now reasonably well understood. However, the aeronomy of the\nlower ionosphere, SO-100 km, remains poorly understood and leas recently\nattracted remarkable attention. Measurements in this region by balloons\nand satellites are difficult because balloons cannot ascend to these\naltitudes and satellites cannot remain in orbit because of large drag\nforces. aowever rockets are well suited for the purpose.\nBelow 90 km, even the daytime electron density is less than\n10 6 cm - \'. however, even such small electron densities at a height between 70 and 90 km in the D region are very important because of their\neffact on broadcast communications. The region between 50 and 70 km,\ncalled the C region, is distinguished by an ionization production rate\nwhich is independent of solar zenith angle, supposedly due to galactic\ncosmic rays, and is also responsible for the pre-sunrise ionospheric\neffects on very low frequency radio propagation.\n\n>>\n\n0.1\n\nBefore the IQSY, many rockets were launched for the development of\nnew experimental techniques for making measurements in the lower ionosphere. During and after the IQSY, the Aeronomy Laboratory combined\nbasic well-tried experiments on rocket payloads, designed to be used\nrepeatedly under a wide variety of ionospheric conditions to answer\nspecific questions about the behavior of the upper atmosphere for the\nsolution of specific aeronomic problems. Each of the payloads included\nradio propagation experiment. The radio experiment is a variation of\nthe Seddon-Jackson (1958) radio propagation technique. The principle of\nthe radio measurement of electron density is a comparison of the differerce in attenuation coefficients (differential absorption) and phase\nvelocities (Faraday rotation) of the ordinary and extraordinary magnetoionic components, at a frequency in the range of 2 to 4 MHz.\nThe radio propagation experiment has been used successfully by the\nUniversity of Illinois more than 20 times for the measurement of electron density in the region between 50 and 100 km. However, below 70 km,\nsince the electron density is very low, the accuracy of the experiment\nis adversely affected by several phenomena. To improv , . the accuracy of\nthe electron density measurements in this region, theoretical studies,\ncareful examination of data and refinement of the present techniques are\ndesired.\nThe objective of this study is to develop an understanding of the\neffects of rocket precession, noise, phase delay, and other undesirable\neffects on Faraday rotation and differential absorption as a basis for\nP\t\nimproving the accuracy of the electron density measurements in the\nlower ionosphere.\n\n^\n\n3\n1.2 Radio Propagation Experiment\n1.2.1 Cround Station\nA block diagram of the experiment is shown in Figure 1.1. The two\nexciters, designated 0 and X, are crystal-controlled oscillators, 0 is\noperated at a frequency of f\n250 H2, where f\n\n= f\n\n- 250 Hz, and X is at f\n\n= f\n\n+\n\nis the chosen frequency for a given rocket. The two\n\nattenuators, fed by the exciters, are controlled by the feedback signal\nfrom the rocket. Each attenuator output is divided into two parts.\nOne part goes to a variable phase shifter, and the other goes to a\nvariable attenuator for the generation of circular polarization. The\noutputs are added, amplified, and fed to the antenna array. The array\nconsists of four horizontal half-wave dipoles, elevated one quarter\nwavelength above the ground. The phase shifters and attenuators are\nad3usted so that circularly polarized waves of opposite senses, are\nradiated from the antenna. One is the ordinary mode of circular polarization, rotating north into west in the northern hemisphere, and\ntracing a circle at a frequency of f\n\n= f\n\n- 250 Hz. The other is the\n\nextraordinary mode rotating north into east at a frequency of f x = fc\n* 250 Hz.\nThe ordinary mode power is held rc;istant at 10 watts and the\nextraordinary mode is, initially, 1 watt. This 10 dB power ratio\nproduces a 31.6% amplitude modulation on the signal of the receiver in\nthe rocket. As the rocket advances into the ionosphere, the extraordinary mode is absorbed about six times more rapidly than the ordinary\nmode and the modulation ratio begins to decrease. However, the modulation ratio is sensed during the rocket flight and used in the servo\nloop, which includes the transmitter, the rocket receiver, and the\n\na^\n\na\n\nx\n\n0\n0\n00\nCd\n\na\n0\na\n0\n\nb\nc^\nH\n4-4\n\nEO\nq\nOU\n\n.b\n\nU\nO\n\nm\n\n-4\nO\n\nby\nCt,\n\nI\nL----------------\t\n\n-----.\n\nW_\n\n5\ntelemetry system, to restore and maintain the 31.6% modulation by\nincreasing the extraordinary mode p ower.

In a mixer, the 2 x 250 Ilz reference\nand the rocket spin are combined to form a synthesized reference,\nwhich is compared with the rocket receiver output in a phase detector\n(Phase Det. in the figure). The servo motor is controlled by the phase\ndetector output.\nBefore the rocket enters the ionosphere there is no Faraday\nrotation, and for a suitable initial servo position, the phase difference of the rocket receiver output and the synthesized reference differ\nby 90\n\n0\n\nand no output is obt-fined from the phase detector, and no servo\n\ndriving signal is present. As the rocket enters the ionosphere\nFaraday rotation begins. The phase of the rocket receiver output\nsignal cha:iges with respect to the reference phase, and a polarized\noutput from the phase detector is produced. This output is a servo\nerror signal which causes the servo to rotate the mechanical phase\nshifter an amount necessary to restore the phase difference between\nthe rocket receiver signal and reference signal. The rotation of the\nservo shaft is directly proportional to the Faraday rotation angle,\nand is read out by a helipot in the readout block. The output from\nthe readout block is punched on paper tape. The time code signal\nconsists of repetitive pulses which count elapsed time with respect to\nthe launch time. These pulses are shaped to give punch command pulses\nin the time demodulator (Time Demod. in the figure).\n1.3.3 Differential Absorption Data Processi\nDifferential absorption is represented by the excess of the\nextraordinary transmitted power required to maintain 31.6% amplitude\n\ni\nd-\t\n\ns\n\nto\n\nmodulation ratio between The ordinary and tine extraordinary modes as\nseen at the output of the rocket-borne receiver.

Ideally, E0\nand k are constants.\n0\n\n2.1.3 The Rocket Spin Signal\nThe spin motion of the rocket is detected by a magnetic aspect sensor, which is mounted transversely to the rocket axis (Smith et al.,\n1965). The projection of the geomagnetic field on the plane, on which\nthe sensitive direction of the magnetic aspect sensor is rotating due\nto the rocket spin, determines the peak-to-peak value of the rocket spin\nsignal, E s . By the spin motion of the rocket, this signal varies sinusoidally. ti\xe2\x80\xa2:e express the rocket sr:n signal as:\ne = E cos w t\n\ns\t\n\ns\t\n\ns\n\nwhere\nws = 21 x (rocket spin frequency). Ideally,\nE is a constant.\ns\n\n2.2 Theory of Operation of the Faraday Rotation Data Processing System\nThree signals are involved in finding the Faraday rotation angle.\nThese signals are the rocket receiver output, the rocket spin, and the\nphase reference (2 x 250 Hz). Again we consider an ideal case first in\nwhich we exclude effects of rocket precession. The equations for the\nthree signals are:\n(1)\n\nfor the rocket receiver output signal,\ne o = A 0 0 + a 0 cos 2a s ) cos 2(a R + a F )\t\n\n(2)\n\n(2.1)\n\nfor thc\xe2\x80\xa2 rocket spin signal,\ne l a A l cos a s\t\n\n(2.2)\n\n^\t\n\ny\n\n26\n\n(3) and for the phase reference signal,\ne 1 = A 2 cos 2a \t\n\n(2.3)\n\nwhere the equations have been simplified and made symmetrical by the\nidentities:\ne o = e 03\n\n,\n\nA o = E 02\n\nko = a\n\no,\n\ne\n\nl\n\n= e s , and A\n\nl\n\n= Es\n\n.\n\nThere are three main steps in extracting the Farada y rotation angle\nfrom these signals\n(Step 1) Doubling the rocket spin rate\nIn this step, the rocket spin signal is divided into two parts,\nboth of which are equal in amplitude. One of them is advanced in phase\nTr\n\nby\t\n\nand the other is delayed by\n\n4\t\n\nTheir product gives g a s as repre-\n\nsented b-, Equation (2 4)\nelf = G\n\n1\n\ncos\n\n(a_\n\n^\n+ al\ncos (a s - -\t) = Gl cos g a s\t\n\n(2.4)\n\n(Step 2) Synthesizing signals to form a reference signal.\nIn this step, the racket _.pin and the phase reference signals are\ncombined to form a s%nthe:,,LZed reference signal \t\n\nHere, we explain the\n\noperation only by mathematical equations:\n\ne 3 = G [cos(2a R - 2^\t\n3\n\n^) cos ( g a s - 4) + c (2a R r\nos\n(2.S)\n\n2y F -) cos (2a^ -)) = A 3 cos 2(aR\t\n\nwhere 2Q\n\n^F + as)\n\n- the servo shaft position angle, which is added to 2a\n\nof the\n\nphase reference signal before the above operation.\n(St c\n\n31\n\nIn this step, the synthesized reference signal and the rocket receiver output signal are compared in phase to find the Faraday rotation\n\n27\nangle a F . Before the rocket enters the ionosphere there is no Farada y\ta\nrotation, and for a suitable initial servo position, the phase difference of the rocket receiver output and the synthesized reference is 90\xc2\xb0\n(neglecting the oath length phase change of 1.2\xc2\xb0jkm) and no output is\nobtained from a phase detector, and no servo driving signal is present.\nAs the rocket enters the ionosphere, Faraday rotation begins. The phase\nof the rocket receiver output signal changes with respect to the reference phase, and a polarized output from the phase detector is produced.\nThis output is a servo error signal which causes the servo to turn a\nmechanical phase shifter an amount necessary to restore the phase difference between the rocket receiver signal and reference signal to 90\xc2\xb0.\nThe servo shaft position, which is directly proportional to the Faraday\nrotation angle, is read out. The following equations represent the\noperations described above.\nThe synthesized reference signal is:\n\ne 3 = A 3 cos 2(a R + OF + a s ) .\t\n\n(2.5)\n\nWith a phase delay by 90\xc2\xb0, we have:\n\ne 4 = A 4 sin 2(a R + O F + as)\n\nTh,z rocket receiver output signal is:\n\ne 0 = A 0 (1 + a\n\ncos g a s ) cos 2(a q + aF)\n\nwhich can be written as\na\ne 0\tA 0 [cos 2(a R + a F ) + 20 {cos 2(a R + a F + a s ) +\n(2.6)\ncos 2(a R + a - as)}]\n\n28\n\nThen the product of e\n\nand e 4 is\n\ne^ = e^e4\n\na\nsin 2(a R + ^ + a\n\nG4\n\ns\n\n)[cos 2(a R + a F )\n\n+\n\n; {cos 2(aR\nd\n\n+ a s ) + cos 2 ((A R + a F - a s))]\n\n+aF\n\n_icn except one are removed by a\nAll the terms generated by this equa t\nfilter network in the data processing system.

ANALYSIS OF ROCKET PRECESSION\n\nThe objective of a study of rocket precession is an understanding\nof the errors which the precession causes in measurements of Faraday\nrotation and differential absorption, and hence in measurements of electron density.\n3.1 ;Nike-Apache Precession Characteristics\nA precessing Nike-apache rocket is illustrated in Figure 3.1. The\nrocket spin rate, f s , is usually about 5 to 7 Hz. The rocket precession\nrate, fP , is usually about 0.1 to 0.4 Hz. The spin angular velocity is\nws = 2Trf s , and the precession angular velocity is w p _ 27fp . The precession cone angle, the angle between the axis of the precession cone\nand the rocket axis, B P , in Figure 3.1 is determined in the analy sis to\nfollow. The quantities w\nP\t\n\nand 9 are found to vary slowly with time.\nP\n\nIn Figure 3.2 (a) we vizualize the unit vector of the rocket axis\nR, the geomagnetic field vector B, the unit vector of the magnetic aspect\nsensor S perpendicular to R, and w\n\nthe rocket spin about R. By the ro-\n\ntation of S about R, we expect the rocket spin signal to be\ne sI a B sin wsL\n}\nIn Figure 3.2 (b), B 1 and S are coplanar and we expect the result\ne s2 a B I sin w\n\ns\n\nt .\n\nFinally, in Figure 3.2 (c) we vizualize a rocket rotating about its\naxis R at a rate w s , and R itself gradually precessing at a rate w\n\nabout\n\na precession axis (vertical in the figure) which is tangent to the rocket\ntrajectory .

Now, let us look at Figure 3 3 for a\ncomparison of Processed Faradav rotation data with rocket spin signal\nfor Nike-apache 14.270. ; ,6,e notice a gradual variation along the Faradav\nrotation curve with the same changing rate as the envelop change of the\nrocket spin signal above in the f f ;ure.

However, the rocket\nspin frequency is 1, higher at the beginning and 1. lower at the and of\nthe Faraday rotation range (41 through 83 seconds after launch) than\nthe center frequency (about 6.7 Hz). A 1 19 change in f\n\nis O.WJ7 Ilz or\n\n24.1 deg/sec, which is an intolerably iarge fraction of a typical\nFaraday rate ranging from 2 tc 500 deg!sec. Therefore the signal\ngenerator must be phase locked with the rocket spin signal, to preclude\na large error in the measured Faraday rotation angle. Phase locking a\nsignal generator to the nois y spin signal with a required accuracy of\nabout 0.1% or less has not yet been --ttempted.\n3.7 A Faraday Rotation Correction for the Rock e t Dist ance\nThere is a phase difference between the 2 x 250 IIz reference\nsignal and the 2 x 250 liz component of the rocket receiver output signal\nas recorded o:i the telemetry tapes. This phase difference consists of\ntwo parts. There is a constant phase shift in the electrical networks\nof the instrumentation system. This shift is independent of the position of the rocket and -does not introduce an error in Faraday rotation\nmeasurements. There is also a phase difference which is a function of\nthe distance, r, between the ground station and the rocket. This shift\ndoes introduce a Farada y rotation error.\nThe free space transit time, t, for signals to travel the round\ntrip, 2r, to the rocket is t = 2r/3 x 10 8 (sec). During this period\nthe phase change of the reference signal is\n\ny (deg) = (2 x 250) x t x 360 = 1.20 r, r in km.\n\nt-\n\n47\n\nThe time rate of phase change is\n\ndQ\ndt\t\n\n(deg/sec) = d^ dr = 1.20 v\n\ndr dt\n\nwhere v(km/s) is the roc\'Net velocity.\n\nThe velocity of a Nike-Apache rocket in the lower ionosphere is of\nthe order of 1.5 km/sec. This velocity results in a phase change rate\nor apparent Faraday rotation rate of 1.8 deg/sec. Over the typical\nrange of measured Faraday rotation rate, from 2 to 500 deg/sec, a\ncorrection for the 1.8 deg/sec apparent rite is unnecessary at the\ngreater altitudes but is important for the accurate measurements of the\nsmall electron densities at the lower altitudes.\n\n3\n\n48\n1. CONCLUSION\nThe following conclusions have been reached in the course of this\nstudy.\n1. On rocket precession:\na.\n\nThe angle between the precession cone axis and the geomagnetic field, O 8 , is nearly constant (19.25 + 0.55 deg)\nfor the time interval of 43 to 75 sec after launch. as\nshown in Table 3.1 for 14,270.\n\nb.\n\nThe precession frequency, f P , varies from 0.4 to 0.02 Hz,\nand the precession angle, 9 P , varies from 1.6 to 10.5 deg\nFor time interval of 40 to 90 sec. as shown in Figures 3.7\nand 3.8. For the interval of 90 to 300 sec, f\n0.2) x 10 -2 liz and\n\n0P\n\nis (2.0 +\n\nis 11.0 + 0.5 deg, as shown in\n\nFigure 3.8 for 14.146.\n2. On precession effects:\na.\n\nThere is no precession effect on Faraday rotation. The\nessence of the analysis discussed in Section 3.5.1 is that\na slow variation on the envelope of the rocket spin signal,\ndue to precession, does not affect the Faraday rotation\nangle me,isurement.\n\nb.\n\nThe intensity of radio waves at the rocket-borne antenna\ndep- \xe2\x80\xa2 \'s oil\n\n\t angle between the rocket axis and the\n\ndir _tion of the wave normal. This angle varies as the\nrocket ascends. Therefore the received intensit y of the\nradio waves changes due to this precession. however, both\nthe ordinary and the extraordinary modes are affected\nequally, and consequently the power ratio of these modes\n\n49\ndoes not charge. \'Therefore, there is no precession effect\non differential absorption, as concluded in Section 3.5.2.\n3. On\n\nimportant properties of the signals for Faraday rotation\n\nmeasurements:\na. Amplitude variations of the signals at a rate less than\nseveral Ilz do not affect the measurement res\'ilt.\nh. A small error in frequency or phase of a sinulated rocket\nspin signal does affect the result. As shown in Section\n3.0, when the rocket spin frequency is 6.7 Ilz, an error\nof to corresponds to a Faraday rotation rate of 24.1 deg/\nsec.\nc. Fixed phase shifts in the electrical networks of the\nrocket instrumentation system d- not introduce errors in\nFa r.iday rotation measurements. However, a time dependent\nphase shift of the 2 x 250 Ilz component of the receiver\noutput signal introduces an error in Faraday rotation\nmeasurements of about 2 deg/sec. This is a 100% error\ninitially but decreases to a 0.4% when the Faraday rate\nincreases to 500 deg/sec.\n\n:, 0\nREFL\xe2\x80\xa2RENCES\n\nSeddon, .1. C.
