The helicopters achieve these noise levels because they are, by design, free of impulsive noise in level flight and climb. Avoiding an impulsive noise signature is achieved by developing and applying configuration design criteria that eliminate blade vortex intersections and recognize advancing blade tip noise limitations in high speed forward flight. Airfoil design, rotor separation and rotor tipspeed selection all contribute to the noise control. Compliance with the approach element of the standards is marginal at best. The approach problem is not appreciably alleviated by reduced tipspeed and airfoil design. Since it is a single rotor phenomenon, it is not alleviated by rotor separation in the tandem configuration. Tip shapes may provide the answer, but to date this approach has not led to a satisfactory solution.", "title": "Boeing Vertol noise reduction experience", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-12T00:30:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19840021598, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Walls, W.
