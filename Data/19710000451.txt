Most existing\nplasma accelerators use strong shocks produced h\n\nThe plasma gun (see fig.) consists of the follos ing\ncomponents: a truncated conical shell (the anode):\nan axially concentric cylindrical or conical rod (the\n\nSolenoid Puff-\n\nPuf fValve\n\nfl\nrull.\t\n\nIIIOWCIL'.fl\n\nmagnetohydrodynaniic techniques to accelerate the\nparticles, but the particles can only travel as fast\n\ncathode): an upstream insulator which provides a\ngas-tight seal and which electricall y insulates the\nanode from the cathode; and a fast-acting solenoid\n\nas the shock speed (about 2 lO cm/see). In addition, such accelerators either cannot focus plasmas,\nor can only provide a modicLim of focusing as a\nresult of the magnetic pinch effect.\n\nvalve which injects a controlled amount (pull) of\ngas into a small pocket located at the upstream end\n(large end) of the gull.\n\nThe solution:\n\nThe gun is operated in a chamber evacuated to a\npressure of lO torr.

The plasma gun typically provides hydrogen\nor deuterium plasma velocities on the order\nof 10cm/sec.\n3. The plasma gun can be used for rocket propul-\n\ncollisions occur to impede their progress. This permits the plasma to travel faster then the shock-propagation velocity.\nThe pocket of gas at the upstream end of the gun\nsupplies gas to the accelerating region for a relatively\nlong period of time, and the ionization process\ncontinues until the bank of stored electrical energy\nis dischar ged. Since the direction of the acceleration\nforce (where E is the electrostatic field vector\nE 13\nand is the induced magiletic field vector) can be\nB\ncontrolled by the shape of the electrodes, focus or\ndefocus of the plasma pulse is possible. In the illustrated focusing configuration, the accelerated plasma issues from the gun in a converging stream which\nhas a focal point at some distance downstream.\n\nNotes:\nI.
