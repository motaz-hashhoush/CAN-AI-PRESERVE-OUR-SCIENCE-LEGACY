b"NASA is contributing to national productivity\nby providing to businesses government-developed\ncomputer programs which are adaptable to\nindustrial use\nfinal configuration. NASTRAN has\nfound hundreds of industrial applications and almost invariably users report substantial time and money\nsavings.\nThere are more than 1,500 other\ncomputer programs available to the\nprivate and public sectors through\nCOSMIC. Collectively, they embrace a\nbroad spectrum of industrial applicability. Among examples of how they\nare being used are two i n the food\nprocessing industry:\n\nIn this age of the computer, more and\nmore business firms are automating\ntheir operations for increased efficiency i n a great variety of jobs, from\nsimple accounting to managing inventories, from precise machining to\nanalyzing complex structures. In the\ninterest of national productivity, NASA\nis providing assistance both to longtime computer users and newcomers\nto automated operations. Through a\nspecial technology utilization service,\nNASA saves industry time and money\nby making available alreadydeveloped computer programs which\nhave secondary utility.\nA computer program is essentially a\nset of instructions which tells the\ncomputer how to produce desired information or effect by drawing upon\nits stored input. Developing a new\nprogram from scratch can be costly\nand time-consuming. Very often,\nhowever, a program developed for\none purpose can readily be adapted\nto a totally different application.\n\n78\n\nTo help industry take advantage of\nexisting computer technology, NASA\noperates the Computer Software\nManagement and Information Center\n(COSMIC)@,\nlocated at the University\nof Georgia. COSMIC maintains a large\nlibrary of computer programs de-\n\nveloped for NASA, the Department of\nDefense, the Department of Energy\nand other technology-generating\nagencies of the government. The Center gets a continual flow of software\npackages, screens them for adaptability to private sector usage, stores\nthem and informs potential customers\nof their availability.\nCOSMIC'S service represents one of\nthe broadest areas of economic benefit resulting from secondary use of\ntechnology. Programs are sold at a\nfraction of their original cost and in\nmost instances users get a return\nmany times their investment; savings\nsometimes amount t o millions of\ndollars. The service has met with\nextraordinary industry acceptance;\nsoftware packages distributed t o\nindustry number in the thousands.\nBest known and most widely used of\nCOSMIC'S packages is the NASTRANa\nprogram, an acronym for NASA Structural Analysis Program. NASTRAN is a\ngeneral purpose program which electronically analyzes a design and predicts how it will stand up under the\nvarious conditions of stress and strain\ni t will encounter in operational service. This permits engineers to study\nthe structural behavior of many different designs before settling on a\n\nRalston Purina Company of St. Louis,\nMissouri, a diversified producer of\nfood and animal feed, found a COSMIC program called STRCMACS a\nvaluable aid to its own computer\ntechnology; STRCMACS is used for\nthe conversion of other computer\nprograms and for development of new\ncomputer systems. The company\nreports that i t achieved significant\nsavings by getting the software from\nCOSMIC rather than buying a comparable program or developing a new\none. Purina also effected additional\nsavings in reduced development time.\nA. E. Staley Manufacturing Company,\nDecatur, Illinois, similarly reports\nmonetary and time savings through\nuse of two COSMIC programs, one\ncalled ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)\nand another which has no acronym\nfor its technical title. These programs\nwere used in research and development on management functions and\non ways of processing corn and soybean products, such as corn starch,\nsyrup, soybean oil and animal feed.\nAdditional examples of how COSMIC\nprograms are contributing to industrial productivity are contained o n the\nfollowing pages. Other examples are\nlisted elsewhere in this volume in the\nchapters on transportation and\nconstruction spinoffs.\n@\n\nNASTRAN and\n\nCOSMIC are registered trademarks\n\nof the National Aeronautics and Space Adminlstrat~on\n\nRalston Purina Company is conducting extensive research on the\ncomplex structure of the soybean to\nimprove soy protein for sale to other\nfood manufacturers. The company is\none of many which have employed\nNASAICOSMIC computer programs in\nindustrial operations.\n\nIn these photos, a truckload of soybeans spills down a chute at a\nprocessing facility of A.
