We have used this technique to characterize sub-micron scale element composition of Proterozoic organics that are clearly biogenic as a guide for interpreting problematic structures in terrestrial or extraterrestrial samples. We used the NanoSIMS 50 of the National Museum of Natural History in Paris to map carbon, nitrogen (as CN), and sulfur in organic structures from the approximately 0.8 Ga Bitter Springs Formation. We analyzed spheroidal and filamentous microfossils as well as organic laminae that appeared amorphous by optical and scanning electron microscopy. In clear-cut microfossils, a coincidence between optical images and NanoSIMS element maps suggests a biological origin for the mapped carbon, sulfur, and nitrogen; this conclusion is supported by high resolution NanoSIMS maps showing identical spatial distributions of C, CN and S. High resolution images also demonstrate distinctive nano structure of the filaments and spheroids. In the amorphous laminae, NanoSIMS reveals morphologies reminiscent of compressed microfossils. Distinct CN/C ratios of the spheroids, filaments, and laminae may reflect their biological precursors (cell walls, cyanobacterial sheaths, and microbial communities/biofilms, respectively). Similar amorphous laminae comprise a preponderance of the organic matter in many Precambrian deposits. Thus it is possible that NanoSIMS will provide fresh insight into a large body of previously uninterpretable material. Additionally, NanoSIMS analysis may establish new biosignatures that will be helpful for assessing the origin and biogenicity of controversial Archean structures and any organic materials that may occur in Martian or other extraterrestrial samples.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20080026143, "endDate": "2006-03-30T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "NASA Headquarters", "location": "Washington, DC, United States"}}, "meetingId": "f1a136e7d81e49faaaf72da689e53bd9", "id": "94b42fa688134e5ca1d2579aadc674e1"}], "name": "Astrobiology Science Conference 2006", "location": "Washington D.C.", "id": "f1a136e7d81e49faaaf72da689e53bd9", "startDate": "2006-03-26T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20080026143, "id": "019ad21053bd4c3bbf9180913bbc7054", "publicationDate": "2006-03-26T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
