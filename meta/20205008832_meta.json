The plants could provide food and O2 for the humans, while removing CO2 and helping purify wastewater. Studies to date have shown that a wide range of crops can be grown in controlled environment conditions envisioned for space.  These systems will be volume and power constrained and will require recycling of water and nutrients. Light is a critical factor both for crop productivity and system power costs, and recent improvements in LEDs make them a preferred lighting option for space.  NASA funded research helped test LEDs for plant lighting beginning in1990 and their continued development for the next 15 years. The explore volume efficiency, concepts such as vertically stacked hydroponic systems and light banks were tested in NASA\u2019s Biomass Production Chamber at Kennedy Space Center, FL, US from 1988 through 2000.  This was perhaps one of the first operational vertical farms.  Findings from these and related tests around the world date suggest that with ~30-40 mol m-2 day-1 of photosynthetically active radiation, about 20-25 m2 of crops could supply the O2 for one human, while about 50 m2 would be required for food (dietary calories).", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 20205008832, "publisher": "", "id": "f732a6bee38443979669a2a4694a3326", "publicationName": "", "publicationDate": "2020-10-01T04:00:00.0000000+00:00", "url": ""}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "NASA TM-2020-5008832 NASA's Contributions to Vertical Farming.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20205008832/downloads/NASA%20TM-2020-5008832%20NASA's%20Contributions%20to%20Vertical%20Farming.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20205008832/downloads/NASA%20TM-2020-5008832%20NASA's%20Contributions%20to%20Vertical%20Farming.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20205008832/downloads/NASA%20TM-2020-5008832%20NASA's%20Contributions%20to%20Vertical%20Farming.pdf.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
