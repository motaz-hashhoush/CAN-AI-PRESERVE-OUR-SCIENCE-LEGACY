Examples of these mission concepts include the Stellar Imager (SI), the Space Infrared Interferometric Telescope (SPIRIT), the Submillimeter Probe of the Evolution of Cosmic Structure (SPECS), and the Fourier-Kelvin Stellar Interferometer (FKSI). We have been developing computer-based simulators for these missions. These simulators are aimed at providing a quantitative evaluation of the imaging capabilities of the mission by modeling the performance on different realistic targets in terms of sensitivity, angular resolution, and dynamic range. Both Fizeau and Michelson modes of operation can be considered. Our work is based on adapting a computer simulator called imSIM which was initially written for the Space Interferometer Mission in order to simulate the imaging mode of new missions such as those listed. This report covers the activities we have undertaken to provide a preliminary version of a simulator for the SPIRIT mission concept.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 20030016758, "id": "ed5d5bece81344e7a5ddff3b27e7add7", "publicationDate": "2002-12-23T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20030016758.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20030016758/downloads/20030016758.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20030016758/downloads/20030016758.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20030016758/downloads/20030016758.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
