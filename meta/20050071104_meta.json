The validation objectives are to demonstrate the research-quality science capability of the ST-5 spacecraft; to operate the three spacecraft as a constellation; and to design, develop, test and flight-validate three capable micro-satellites with new technologies. A three-month flight demonstration phase is planned, beginning in March 2006. This year, the mission was re-planned for a Pegasus XL dedicated launch into an elliptical polar orbit (instead of the Originally-planned Geosynchronous Transfer Orbit.) The re-plan allows the mission to achieve the same high-level technology validation objectives with a different launch vehicle. The new mission design involves a revised science validation strategy, a new orbit and different communication strategy, while minimizing changes to the ST-5 spacecraft itself. The constellation operations concepts have also been refined. While the system engineers, orbit analysts, and operations teams were re-planning the mission, the implementation team continued to make progress on the flight hardware. Most components have been delivered, and the first spacecraft is well into integration and test.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20050071104, "endDate": "2005-03-12T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "2004 IEEE Aerospace Conference", "location": "Big Sky, MT", "id": "9e5977da0c004c7bbb27c60d9468d688", "startDate": "2005-03-05T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20050071104, "id": "58ab1396d4d84e1abe9b0efaa61db723", "publicationDate": "2005-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20050071104.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20050071104/downloads/20050071104.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20050071104/downloads/20050071104.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20050071104/downloads/20050071104.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
