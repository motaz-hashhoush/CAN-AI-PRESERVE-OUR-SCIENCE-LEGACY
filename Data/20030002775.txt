b'Ground\n\nUse\n\nSensor\n\nAlong with airborne\nand spaceborne\ninstruments,\nremote sensing\ntechniques\nemploy a number of ground\nuse sensory systems for measuring\nand analyzing\nradiation\nreflected\nfrom Earth targets to discriminate\namong\nclasses of visually-similar\nobjects.\nOne use of\nsuch systems\nis "ground\ntruthing,"\nmaking on-the-spot\nexaminations\nof ground\ntargets\nas a means,of\nverifying\nsatellite\ndata. Ground\nuse systems\ncan also be employed\nindependently\nin a wide range of applications.\nAn example\nof a ground\nuse device is the system\nshown\nin the accompanying\nphoto.\nCalled the Hand Held\nRatioing\nRadiometer,\nit was developed\nby Jet Propulsion\nLaboratory\nin the course of NASA-sponsored\nresearch.\nIt is now being manufactured\nand sold by Barringer\nResearch\nLimited,\nRexdale, Ontario\nunder a patent\nlicense. Designed\nfor field portable\nuse, the\nbattery-powered\nunit weighs only 12 pounds.\nA radiometer\nis an instrument\nfor measuring\nthe\nintensity\nof reflected\nradiation.\nThe Barringer\nRatioing\nRadiometer\nhas an added capability:\nit simultaneously\nanalyzes\nradiation\nintensities\nin two separate\nbands of\nthe spectrum\nand calculates\nthe ratio of one to the other;\nthis affords\nmore positive\nidentification\nof the material\nbeing analyzed.\nThe "reflectance\nratio" is displayed\nin digital\nform; this information\nenables analysts to\ndetermine\nthe particular\ncharacteristics\nof the target.\nOne application,\nillustrated\nin the photo, is\nexamination\nof rock for the presence\nof specific\nminerals;\nin addition\nto its analytical\ncapability,\nthe\nsystem offers extra field prospecting\nutility by providing\ninstant results on-site, eliminating\nthe necessity\nfor\nlaboratory\nanalysis\nof samples.\nAnother\nuse is\ndetermining\nthe health status and yield potential\nof\nagricultural\ncrops. Among\nmany other applications\nare\nstudies\nof water quality, water color as an indication\nof\nsediment,\nalgae growth,\nsoil moisture\ncontent and other\nsoil characteristics,\nand pollution\neffect on forest cover.\n\n108\n\n'
