A radiotracer such as krypton (Kr-85)\nor carbon (C-14) is added in small quantity to the\ncompressed gas. The sensitive element of the leakage\ndetection system is an avalanche detector which consists of an avalanche diode coupled with a tunnel\ndiode amplifier. The avalanche diode is a silicon\ndevice with a gallium-diffused structure. When radiation is absorbed in conventional silicon diodes, holeelectron pairs are created which reach the PN\njunction and are swept across to provide a current.\nIn contrast, the avalanche diode has a high internal\nfield and when radiation produces a hole-electron\npair, silicon atoms are ionized; if the internal field\nis high, a cascade of electrons is produced. Charge\nmultiplications of the order of 100 to 1000 are realizable when bias voltages are in the range of 1500 to\n1800 volts; if the signal is generated near the front\n\nIt has been shown that a small avalanche detector\ncan sense radioactive gas leaking through a gas jet\nnozzle, but only marginally. On the other hand, if\nthe detector area can be increased, the lower limit\nfor sensing leak rates is lowered proportionally and\nquantitative measurements of leak rate can be made.\n\nReference:\nLocker, R.
