The system also calculates other statistical parameters such as the 'mean heart rate' over specific time period and heart rate histogram. This SAS is used by NASA Principal Investigators as a research tool to determine the effects of weightlessness on the human cardiovascular system. This is also used to determine if Lower Body Negative Pressure (LBNP) is an effective countermeasure to the orthostatic intolerance experienced by astronauts upon return to normal gravity. In microgravity, astronauts perform the LBNP experiment in the mid deck of the Space Shuttle. The experiment data are downlinked by the orbiter telemetry system, then processed and analyzed in real-time by the integrated Life Sciences Data Acquisition (LSDS) - Spectral Analysis System. The data system is integrated within the framework of two different computer systems, VAX and Macintosh (Mac), using the networking infrastructure to assist the investigators in further understanding the most complex machine on Earth--the human body.", "title": "MAC to VAX Connectivity: Heartrate Spectral Analysis System", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T18:03:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19930016405, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Rahman, Hasan H."}, "organization": {"name": "General Electric Co.", "location": "Houston, TX, United States"}}, "id": "8ca10ffe410441bcaf7479d0748c8255"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19930016405, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Faruque, Monazer"}, "organization": {"name": "General Electric Co.", "location": "Houston, TX, United States"}}, "id": "34a5061865d142f0ba7e30f74dc2774c"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2014-08-28T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19930016405, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19930016405, "id": "82be3275c09c4e559392967e365025d2", "publicationName": "NASA, Washington, Technology 2002: The Third National Technology Transfer Conference and Exposition, Volume 1", "publicationDate": "1993-02-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 19930016372, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "Technology 2002: the Third National Technology Transfer Conference and Exposition, Volume 1", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PROCEEDINGS", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19930016405.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19930016405/downloads/19930016405.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19930016405/downloads/19930016405.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19930016405/downloads/19930016405.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
