Radiance is calculated from processing\nraw signals with background, temperature, and electronic contamination corrected. Measured gain is calibrated\nwith a fully Sunlit solar diffuser (SD) at a stable radiance level, considering a slowly changing SD reflectance\ndegradation. These measurements provide time-dependent gain adjustment factors, and the calibration assumes\na linear response for each band and detector. Hence, an analysis of the dependence on different radiance levels\nis warranted. The MODIS design has no mechanism for varying radiance levels, except for an attenuator screen.\nHowever, it has been in static configuration for Terra since mid-2003. An external source of radiance attenuation\ncan be utilized during solar eclipse events, while maintaining high stability and accuracy of solar calibration\nstandards. Due to its long mission lifetime, Terra has seen several Sun-Moon near-conjunction events when it\ncoincides with the orbit path where the SD is directly illuminated. As of August 2020, we have identified 7 viable\npartial solar eclipses in the Terra mission data. We will discuss several results of our study, including comparison\nof measured SD signal to predicted radiance reduction based on a solar disk radiance model; nominal and outlier\nbehavior as a function of bands, detectors, and mirror-sides; and comparison with other data sets. Our main\nconclusion from this study is that there is no notable correlation of detector-dependent trend with radiance level\nfor most RSB bands.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "US", "submissionId": 20210014943, "sponsors": [{"organizationId": "75e5193408955f81ae8ee5a122abe0ee", "meta": {"organization": {"name": "International Society for Optics and Photonics", "location": "Bellingham, Washington, United States"}}, "meetingId": "226f5a2acfdd45839eb72a1821d8e415", "id": "1e84d40180f8435facc6961b4ec30ee0"}], "name": "SPIE Defense + Commercial Sensing", "location": "Virtual", "id": "226f5a2acfdd45839eb72a1821d8e415", "startDate": "2021-04-12T04:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20210014943, "publisher": "SPIE", "id": "64d19c4216674362920710834a2f5350", "publicationName": "Proceedings Volume 11727, Algorithms, Technologies, and Applications for Multispectral and Hyperspectral Imaging XXVII\t", "publicationDate": "2021-05-12T04:00:00.0000000+00:00", "issuePublicationDate": "2021-04-12T04:00:00.0000000+00:00", "url": "", "doi": "10.1117/12.2586219\t"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "Terra_MODIS_sees_solar_eclipses_final_submission.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20210014943/downloads/Terra_MODIS_sees_solar_eclipses_final_submission.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20210014943/downloads/Terra_MODIS_sees_solar_eclipses_final_submission.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20210014943/downloads/Terra_MODIS_sees_solar_eclipses_final_submission.pdf.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
