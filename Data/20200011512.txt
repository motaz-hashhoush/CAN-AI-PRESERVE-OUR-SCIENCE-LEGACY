Pinatubo explosively erupted magma and overlying rock, with ejecta reaching\nstratospheric altitudes. The sulphate aerosol burden resulting from the 1991 eruption was still\nmeasurable in 1992 and its complete removal took 5-6 years. Here we present new analyses of\nmeasurements by the ATMOS instrument on the Atlas-1 Space Shuttle mission and the MkIV\nballoon interferometer in 1992 that show about 40-50 ppt of unexpected excess HCN in the middle\nstratosphere. HCN has no stratospheric sources and a lifetime of several years. Multi-year runs\nwith the GEOS-Chem Chemistry-Transport model have been performed in order to derive the most\nplausible HCN injection amounts. The overall structure of the modeled HCN agrees reasonably\nwell with observations by MkIV and ATMOS. The current best estimate is an emission of about 6\nkt of HCN into the stratosphere at an altitude of about 23 km. This compares to a total gas emission\nin the order of 70-700 Mt, based on an emission of 14 Mt SO2 and an SO2/total gas ratio of 2% 20%. We will discuss possible sources and formation mechanisms of the HCN. These include\nabiotic formation during or prior to the eruption and may involve HCN accumulated in the\nsubaerial volcanic-hydrothermal system of Mt. Pinatubo. We present results from thermochemical\nequilibrium calculations as well as photochemical plume modeling in order to provide plausibility\nconstraints on the source of the HCN.\n\n'
