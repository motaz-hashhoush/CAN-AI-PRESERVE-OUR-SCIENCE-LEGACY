The source was first discovered by ROSAT and was confirmed as a SSS with a blackbody temperature of about l00eV by Chandra. During 2000 March, Chandra detected it at Lx=4e39 erg per second, and then in 2000 October, its luminosity dropped to around le39 erg per second. During 2004, Chandra is conducting a monitoring program for Ml0l. The SSS was near the detection limit during January, March, and May; the X-ray spectra were harder with a power-law shape, and the X-ray luminosity was about 3e37 erg/second, a factor of greater than 200 fainter than that in the previous high state. The source was found to be in outburst again during the July 5 observation, with an X-ray luminosity of about 7e39 erg/second. Data taken on July 6,7, and 8 show that the source was in a strong outburst with a peak bolometric luminosity of about 7e39 erg/second. In general, the X-ray spectra are best described with an absorbed blackbody model with temperatures of approximately 50-100eV. In addition, we found absorption edges at 0.33, 0.57, 0.66, and 0.88 keV in two of the high state spectra. These features may signal the presence of highly ionized gas in the vicinity of the accretor (e.g., warm absorber). In order to study an ultraluminous SSS in outburst in detail, we proposed a TOO XMM observation to observe the source. The observation was taken on July 23 and the source was fainter with a luminosity of 6e38 ergs, and a harder X-ray spectrum with a power-law tail seen up to 7 keV. This clearly indicates that the source was in the decline stage with spectral change. In addition to the XMM observation, we also arranged radio observation and a simultaneous CFHT observation. The X-ray results were published in ATel and ApJL. There were several more Chandra observations taken after 2004 July. The source was in a low luminosity state but it underwent another X-ray outburst in 2004 December. We are arranging more follow-up observations for this intriguing source.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "publications": [{"submissionId": 20050092331, "id": "0a8d8c0e8b51487bb8ae3ba13b4ae06c", "publicationDate": "2005-02-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
