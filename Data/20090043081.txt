The term actuator as used\nherein refers to a device that converts electrical energy into\nmechanical motion, in particular, for moving a load. For\nexample, so-called "inch worms" are known actuators. Inch\nworm actuators come in many forms and variations, including piezoelectric, magnetostrictive, electromagnetic, and\nshaped memory alloy, for example.\nHowever, piezoelectriclelectrostrictive "inch worms" have\ndifficulties with their clamps, both in reaching their clamp\nraces and in the excessive voltage required to drive these\nclamps,They also have problems dueto reducedpiezoelectric\nmotion at the low temperatures such as are encountered in\nouter space operations, for example. Magnetostrictive "inch\nalso have difficulties with their clamps in reaching\ntheir races, n e i r performancedoes not degrade in low\nperatures but, they are, unacceptably large and bulky due to\ntheir coils and mechanical preload structure. Electromagnetic\n"inch worms" are also large and bulky, typically do not hold\nposition with power off and have trouble holding with their\nclamps, ynch wormsm in general, also typically have difficulties with -glitchesmas they grasp and release during steps,\n~ ~ t ~screws are known actuators, ~h~~~ come in\nr i ~ ~ d\nmany forms and variations including piezoelectric, from travcling wave and oscillatory, to one way drives, such as picomotors, ~h~~~also include electromagnetic motors driving\nscrews through a speed reducing transmission, and the electromagnetic equivalent of picomotors.\nHowever, piezoelectriclelectrostrictive motorized screws\nhave problems associated with poor performance of the\npiezoelectriclelectrostrictive materials in the cold temperatures of outer space operations, for example. The electromagnetic equivalent of motorized screws has the problem of\nachieving precise, repeatable very small steps. The small\nstroke of the piezo crystal helps in this respect. Electromagnetic motorized screws also tend to be large due to the windings.\nVoice coils are also known actuators. However, voice coils\nthey are\ntypically do not hold position with power off,\nrelatively large and bulky.\nLinear electromagnetic motors are also known actuators.\nHowever, linear electromagnetic motors typically do not hold\nposition with power off.\nDirect expansiodcontraction piezoelectriclelectrostrictive\nactuators (very short stroke) are also known actuators. However, these actuators typically do not have sufficient cumulative stroke and are limited in their cold temperature performance.\nTherefore, a need exists for an improved actuator that\novercomes the problems, drawbacks and limitations of the\nknown actuators, such as those mentioned above.\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\n55\n\n60\n\n65\n\nAccording to an aspect of the

As mentioned above, in this exemplary embodiment,\nthe four coils 115a-d can be activated (energized) indepenstep. The flexure steppers or "slides" 102 are also illustrated\nin FIG. 3 .\ndently to achieve the stepping movement desired.\n\ni\n\n~\n\n13\n\n14\n\nAs can be best seen in FIG. 1a, the stepping elements 102\nare disposed within the frame, separated by some distance,\nreferred to as a "gap," from the frame 104. As indicated, the\ngap between the stepper elements 102 and the surfaces 106 of\nthe frame forming the race is approximately 0.002 to 0.005\ninches, for example. This dimension is mathematically\nrelated to the step size, as will be explained in detail below.\nHowever, this dimension may be varied without departing\nfrom the scope and spirit of the invention. The dimension of\nthe gap is fundamentally a matter of design choice, dependent\non the dimensions of the other structures, the selection of\nmaterials, and the particular configurations of an implementation, which are chosen to provide efficient and reliable\noperation, and thus are subject to some range of variation, as\nwould be understood by one skilled in the art.\nThe gap size used in an experimental implementation was\n0.010 inches, and it should be understood that this dimension\nis subject to some variation depending on design criteria and\npractical requirements, as would be apparent to one skilled in\nthe art. and such variation is considered to be within the snirit\nand scope of the invention described herein.\nIn this embodiment, the frame 104 is preferably a soft\nferromagnetic material such as Hiperco 50A. The keepers\n110 are preferably also made of a soft ferromagnetic material.\nThe flexible member 112, tape or flexure, is preferably a\nrelatively thin, non-magnetic material, for example, a sheet or\ntape of flexible, non-magnetic spring steel or aluminum, and\nshould be able to withstand repeated bending without failure\ndue to metal fatigue, for example. As mentioned above, if\nadvantageous in this regard for a particular application, pivot\nlinks may be incorporated in the flexible member 112.\nThe coils 115 comprise anumber ofwindings, for example,\n20 turns of 0.030 inch diameter wire on a coil having a length\nof 0.625 inches carrying an activation current of approximately 100 milliamps. The magnets may be made of a highperformance magnetic material, for example, neodemium\nboron iron or samarium cobalt.\nThe operation of the first embodiment of a linear stepping\nflexure will now be explained with reference to FIG. 4. FIGS.\n4a-e show basic forward motion flexure stepping (macrostepping) as a sequence of five steps, reading from top (4a) to\nbottom (4e). In these figures the actuator is shown in simplified block diagram form, the slides illustrated as blocks\nlabeled "1" and "2," with the flexure shown as a line running\nhorizontally between these blocks, from block 1to the load\n(not shown).\nInitially in this example, as shown in FIG. 4a, the permanent magnets of the two slides 1and 2 are attracted to the top\nrace of the frame, and slides 1 and 2 are firmly fixed in\nvosition as shown. In this condition. the flexure vortion 112a\nbetween the two permanent magnets of the slides 1and 2 is\nstraight (zero degrees bend), and the flexure portion 112b\nbetween the load (not shown) and the permanent magnet of\nthe slide 1nearest the load, is at some angle 4. The coils (not\nshown) need not be energized at this stage of the operation,\nand the frictional forces generated between the permanent\nmagnet of the slide 1nearest the load (left-hand side of the\nfigure) and the frame, prevent the slide from moving. This,\nalong with the relative stiffness of the flexure portion 112b\nagainst further bending or stretching, therefore, holds the load\nin position some horizontal distance from the slides 1and 2.\nNext referring to FIG. 4b, the slide 2 is switched to the\nbottom race of the frame by activation of at least one of the\nassociated coils (not shown) for the slide 2, overcoming the\nforce holding the slide 2 to the upper race of the frame. After\nthis action, the flexure section 112a between slides 1and 2, is\nbent to some angle 241 (as can be seen in FIG. 4b.). In the\n\nprocess, slide 2 has moved slightly closer to slide 1 in the\nhorizontal direction. The load continues to be held in the same\nposition by slide 1at this time.\nIn FIG. 4c, slide 1is now switched to the bottom race and\nthe flexure portion 112a between slides 1 and 2 straightens\nout (no bending angle). In the process, slide 1moves slightly\nforward (left) closer to the initial position of the load. At the\nsame time, the flexure angle between the load and slide 1,\nswitches from +(Ito -4. Since cos(+$)=cos(-$), the load\nmoves precisely ahead (to the left) a distance equal to the\nmovement of slide 1in that direction. While slide 1is switching from the top frame race to the bottom frame race, the load\nand slide 1 are prevented from moving backwards (to the\nright) by friction between slide 2 and the bottom race which\nholds slide 1firmly in place.\nIn FIG. 4d, slide 2 is switched from the bottom race to the\ntop race and, again, the flexure between slides 1and 2 is bent\nat an angle 24, and slide 2 moves slightly closer to slide 1in\nthe horizontal direction.\nIn FIG. 4e. slide 1is switched from the bottom race to the\ntop race and the flexure angle between slides 1and 2 goes to\nzero (the flexure 112a straightens out). Again, the flexure\nangle between the load and slide 1switches sign, from +(Ito\n-4, and since cos(+$)=cos(-$), the load moves precisely\nahead (to the left) again a distance equal to the movement of\nslide 1in this direction (horizontal). Again, while slide 1 is\nswitching from the top frame race to the bottom frame race,\nthe loadis heldfrommoving backwards (towards the right) by\nfriction between slide 2 and the bottom race. Slide 1moves\nslightly closer to the previous position of the load (to the left),\nand the load moves ahead with it.\nThis sequence of steps, referred to as forward "macro stepping" herein, can be repeated as many times as necessary to\nachieve a relatively long cumulative stroke forward stepping\nmotion.\nFor reverse motion macro stepping, the actuator would be\ncontrolled to follow the same steps of FIG. 4, except in\nreverse order from FIG. 4e, that is, first the movement of FIG.\n4d, then of FIG. 4c (resulting in a small step backwards-to\nthe right), followed by the movements of FIGS. 4b and 4a,\n(resulting in another small step backwards) and a return to\ninitial conditions with both slides 1 and 2 on the top races.\nThis reverse sequence can be repeated as many times as\nnecessary to provide cumulative backward (to the right) stepping a desired distance.\nIt is further noted that, as should be apparent from the\nabove discussion, when the slides 1and 2 are initially on the\nsame respective side of the races, i.e., both on the top race or\nboth the bottom race, and the slide 1 closest to the load is\nmoved between races while the other slide 2 is held in vosition, this results in a change in horizontal position of slide 1\nbackwards (to the right). The load will likewise move a corresponding distance backward (to the right) in the horizontal\ndirection. Therefore, a single macro step backwards (to the\nright) requires only the operation of FIGS. 4e-4d or 4c-4b, for\nexample.\nOn the other hand, if the slides are initially on opposite\nsides of the races, movement of the slide 1closest to the load\nwill result in a change in the horizontal position in the forward\n(to the left) direction, and load will likewise move a corresponding distance forward (to the left) in the horizontal direction. Therefore, in this circumstance, a single macro step\nforward (to the left) requires only the operation of FIGS.\n4b-4c, or FIGS. 4d-4e, for example.\nAccording to the invention, the flexures bend precisely the\nsame amount each time the slides are moved. Also, when one\nslide is being moved between races the other slide does not\n\n5\n\nlo\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\n55\n\n60\n\n65\n\n16\nchange position (slip or slide) on its race. Further, neither\nslide changes position on its race between steps. Therefore,\nthe individual steps are very precise, and repeatable.\nAn advantage of the invention is that the actuator holds\nposition with power off. In the above-described embodiment,\npermanent magnets are used in the slides. Since permanent\nmagnet systems are inherently unstable, and since they are\nessentially flux sources that can easily exert relatively large\nmagnetic forces across relatively large gaps, each slide containing permanent magnets will come to rest against a frame\nrace, and will hold position securely with power off.\nBasic stepping motion supporting calculations are provided below in association with the flexure bending illustrated in FIG. 5.\nFrom the flexure bending illustration of FIG. 5, where:\nAL=Step Size\nL=Flexure Length\n0=Flexure Maximum Bend Angle (at Null Point)\nR=Radius of Flexure Arc\nThe basic Step Size AL is the amount the Flexure shortens\nwhen it bends 0 as shown in the flexure bending illustration of\nFIG. 5.\n\nFrom the Flexure Bending Illustration of FIG. 5, and considering equations (1.6) and (1.7) immediately above, the\nSlope at the Flexure Null Point is:\n5\n\nAnd:\n10\n\nOr, in an equivalent form:\nl5\n\n20\n\n~\n\nAt Flexure Null Point:\n30\n\n~to:\n\n~\n\nd\n\ni\n\n~\n\n~\n\nTHUS:\nFor a given Gap and a given Flexure Length, L, we calculate 0.\nFor a given 0 and the given L, we calculate AL (Step Size).\n\n(1.2)\n\nEXAMPLE\nSubstituting equation (1.1) into equation (1.2), we get:\n\nLet: L=%6 in.; Gap=0.003 in.\n\nRearranging terms,\n0=8.250022 (E-1) deg.

For ultra-precision positioning,\nmicro-stepping can be done within each of the (already precise) macro step sizes described above with reference to\nFIGS. 4a-e. There are many ways to perform micro-stepping\nwith stepping flexures according to the invention, and this\nbrief discussion is limited to introducing the subject and\ndescribing two micro-stepping techniques. One of these techniques described below is passive and the other active.\nPassive Micro-Stepping will be discussed first. Referring\nto FIG. 4a, the top-most diagram, it is noted that both slides 1\nand 2 are fixed to the top race, the flexure 112a connecting\nthem is straight, and the flexure 112b connecting the load to\nthe nearest slide 1 is nearly straight (less than 1 degree).\nAs noted in the example above (after equations 1.1 to 1.1I),\na full step is on the order of 12 (E-6) inches and we are\n\n55\n\n60\n\n65\n\nattempting to micro-step to 0.4 (E-6) in. resolution. The passive technique operates by, for example, stepping 1 step too\nfar, and then perform a single micro-step backwards by precisely, both in amount and in time duration, reducing the\nfriction between each of the slides 1 and 2 and their races,\nthereby letting the load push the two slides back an infinitesimal, but precise and repeatable amount. At the end of this\nmicro-step time duration, the slides 1 and 2 will return to\nbeing fixed to the top races, albeit one micro-step back.\nThis process can be repeated until an ultra-precision position is achieved. The precision and resolution of this technique depends on: (1) the load pushing back as a linear spring\nthroughout the micro-stepping range; (2) the friction being\ncontrolled precisely; and (3) the time duration of the microstep being controlled precisely.\nRegarding (I), with total travel of 12 (E-6), routine contact\nbetween actuator and load has an equivalent spring interface\nthat is linear across this minuscule range. In addition, there\nare already known force actuators, such as those used by\nNASA, that have a precision spring interface with their load\nthat is deliberately designed to provide this precision spring\ninterface many times more than the 12 (13-6) inch micro,tepping range,\nRegarding (2), the coils in the races can be actuated so as to\nmake the slides just barely adhere to their races. This, in turn,\nreduces the normal forces (and the friction) to a tiny amount.\nThe slides are, in effect, semi-magnetic bearings and slide\nvery easily and predictably. The variations in the static coefficient of friction are inconsequential.\nRegarding (3), the time duration of this semi-magnetic\nbearing action is very precise, repeatable and has great resolution, especially in view of the small coil inductances\ninvolved.\nActive Micro-Stepping will now be discussed with reference to FIG. 4b, the diagram, which is second from the top. In\nFIG. 4b, slide 1 is stuck to the top race and slide 2 is stuck to\nthe bottom race. If slide 2 is now placed into a semi-levitation\nmode, and slide 1 is driven down towards the bottom race,\nslide 2 is driven backwards. However, this is only done for a\nfraction of a second, the duration of a micro-step, as the\nsemi-levitation condition of slide 2 is quickly stopped by\ncontrolling its race coil current. Meanwhile, slide 1 continues\nto the bottom race and then is immediately sent back to the top\nrace, where the situation shown in FIG. 4b, second diagram\nfrom the top is resumed, except that the slides and the load\nhave relocated 1 micro-step to the left. This process can be\nrepeated as many times as necessary to achieve a desired\nposition with respect to initial positions.\nIn summary, the above-described embodiment of the\ninvention is a general stepping flexure configuration, comprising two bi-stable contact elements or slides, bi-stable in\nthe sense that each can assume a position either up or down as\nshown in FIGS. 4 . The above-described general magnetic\nstepping flexure configuration includes the two bi-stable contact elements, which each preferably comprise permanent\nmagnets with soft ferromagnetic keepers. These permanent\nmagnet "pistons" are positioned, one behind the other with\nrespect to a load, and are joined to each other by at least one\ntape-like flexible member. The permanent magnet contact\nelements are, in turn, positioned behind a load with the magnetic contact element nearest the loadbeingjoinedto that load\nby a second flexure portion and attached to that load at a point\nmid-way between the races of a frame. This is in contrast to\nso-called "inch worm" actuators which have two clamping\nmembers and an expansionidrive member. These permanent\nmagnet contact elements, with flexures, are also positioned\ninside the frame which performs the dual functions of (1)\n\nUS 7,504,921 B2\n21\n\n22\n\nproviding the magnetic circuits which direct the movements\nof the permanent magnets; and (2) providing the raceihousing\nwhich physically constrainsipositions the actuator moving\nmembers.\nAlso described above were basic stepping flexure locomotiodmovement techniques, involving sequenced up and\ndown motion of the bi-stable contact elements, which results\nin precision one way direction of movement of the load and of\nthe actuator. The at least one flexible member (flexure) joining the contact elements to each other serves to both convert\nthe sequenced up and down motions of the contact elements\ninto one way directional movement of the load with precise,\nhighly repeatable step sizes, and also serves to provide drive\nforce multiplication (mechanical advantage). The bi-stable\ncontact elements or iston tons" both Power the flexures and\nprovide the necessary holdingireaction force, i.e., the friction\nbetween frame and contact elements. BY contrast, in a socalled \'\'inch worm" actuator, clamps provide the holding\nforces and a separate driveiextender provides the drive. The\ncoils inside the frame control the movements of magnetic\ncontact elements.\nRegarding nmvement of the load, macro and micro stepping were described. Passive and active micro-stepping of the\nflexure actuators both involve using precision control of\nactuator friction hold (semi-levitation) to provide micro stepping.\nIt will be apparent to one skilled in the art that the manner\nmaking and using the\nhas been\nadequately disclosed in the above-written description of the\npreferred embodiment taken together with the drawings.\nIt will be understood that the above described preferred\nembodiment of the present invention are susceptible to various modifications, changes, and adaptations, and the same are\nintended to be comprehended within the meaning and range\nof equivalents of the appended claims.\nSome alternate embodiments will now be described. Alternate flexure embodiments will be described first, followed by\na description of alternate actuator configurations. This, in\nturn, will be followed by a series of flexure-only actuators\n(where at least the magnets are stationary) and a series of thin\nmagnet circuits. Then three\nflexures Operation, in particular, a\nsequence, is described.\nflexure preferred\nare\nin\nFIGS. 6a-e and 7a-d.This discussion will be divided into two\nparts, One discussing unbent flexures and One describing bent\nflexures. First a discussion of unbent flexures. These alternate\nflexure\nare intended\nprovide easy flexing\nwhile being very strong in buckling.\nFIGS. 6a-e show sideviews of a series of alternate embodiments in which the flexures are "normally" unbent, i.e. they\nare parallel with the magnet surfaces when the\nflexure mechanism is in a relaxed condition.\nFIG. 6a shows a first alternative embodiment in its relaxed\ncondition and FIG. 6b shows this alternative embodiment in\naction (flexures bending) in its race, in particular, with the\nright-most magnetic element stuck to the top of the race, the\nleft-most magnetic element stuck to the bottom of the race,\nand the load located midway between the top and bottom of\nthe race at the far left of the drawings.\nIn FIGS. 6a and 6b, two parallel flexures are used, one on\ntop of the magnets and one below the magnets. Both flexures\nbend in an S-shaped curve, as described in the analysis above,\nand the step size is the same as described above for the\nprimary embodiment. However, this flexure arrangement\nmay be simpler and less expensive to construct than the primary embodiment. This alternative may also have the added\nadvantage of constraining the magnetic elements so that they\n\nhit and leave the race surfaces with no tilting angle and, hence,\nminimal frictional scrubbing losses and repeatability errors.\nOn the other hand, since two flexures are involved, either the\nparasitic force losses are doubled, or the size (thickness or\nwidth or length) of the flexures must be adjusted.\nFIG. 6c shows a ladder flexure in action (bending). In this\nalternative embodiment, the flexure thickness can be reduced\nto compensate and even improve parasitic bending forces\nwith no loss of strength in buckling. The bending configuration shows two sets of S-shaped curves, above and below each\nother, separated by the ladder rung. This arrangement is compliant in parasitic bending, but tough and rigidincompression\nand buckling.\nFIG, 6d shows the -ladder rungmof the alternative embodiment in FIG. 6c, replaced by a composite substance (labeled\ny - 0 ~ ~ that is relatively\n" )\nin bending and in shear\ndeformation. However, the composite material is attached to\nthe flexures with an adhesive such that the parallel flexures are\nconstrained in buckling,\nthe area of the flexure-composite\nattachment is very large, the composite material can\nbe relatively soft in compression and tension and still prevent\nbuckling. An example of a suitable composite material is a\ncarbon fiber composite,\nFIG, 6e shows a pair of\nflexures, but both are\npositioned over the top of the magnet and the load, hi^\nalternate embodiment arrangement performs like the primary\nembodiment. However, this alternative embodiment may be\nless expensive. Although FIG. 6e shows the two parallel\nflexures with a composite material in between, alternatively\nthe flexure could be comprised of a ladder configuration, i.e.\nparallel flexures with a rung instead of the composite material\nas in FIG, (jc, h o t h e r alternative is a single tape flexure, such\nas in the primary embodiment, hi^ alternative embodiment\nis, essentially, the primary embodiment with an offset of the\nflexure to the top of the magnetic elements. When two parallel\nflexures are used, both would preferably be fixed to each of\nthe magnets and to the load. Of course, it should be apparent\nto one skilled in the art that more than two parallel flexures\ncould be used, and such a modification is considered to be\nwithin the scope and spirit of the invention,\n\n5\n\nlo\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n3\xc2\xb0\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\nBent flexures arrangements are illustrated in FIGS, 7a-c,\nwhile FIG, 7d achieves the "bentmeffect by using two sets of\nflexure segments, the sets being offset by respective\nladder rungs between the magnetic contact elements, The\ngeneral purpose of using these bent flexure arrangements is to\nachieve an increase in stroke length and actuator speed, This,\nof course, means reduced drive force and reduced precision\npositioning as tradeoffs. Since holding force is the limiting\nfactor, the practical tradeoffs are between speed and precision, The increase in step size is dramatic, e,g, one or more\norders of magnitude, depending on offset angle, and is\nroughly defined by the following equation:\n\n55\n[ ( T ) ( ; ) ( ~ ~ ( ~ set angle)?] + ~ l ~ o s ( o f f angle)\nff\nset\nL,\n\n60\n\n65\n\n- ,-\n\nThe arrangements in FIGS. 7a-cparallel their counterparts\nin FIGS. 6a-c, except with an offset angle (a bend) when\ninactive. FIG. 7d is a variation of FIG. 7a, in which an offset\npair of parallel flexures is approximated by the arrangement\nshown in FIG. 7d to simplify eventual MEMS (micro electromechanical systems) construction.\nIn these bent flexure alternative embodiments of FIGS. 7 ,\nthe offset angle may tend to make the flexures somewhat more\nvulnerable to buckling. However, this danger is mitigated by\n\nUS 7,504,921 B2\n23\nkeeping the offset angle minimized by the natural bending\nconstraints imposed by the small gaps used, e.g. on the order\nof 0.003 inches, and by the tendency of the magnets to fail in\nholding long before buckling forces assert themselves.\nA -side windermstepping flexures alternative embodiment 5\nis illustrated in FIGS. 8a-d, and will now be described. This\narrangement is, essentially, similar to the primary embodimerit illustrated in FIGS, 1, 2, and 3 , but having the coil\nwindings, the magnets and keepers rotated 90 degrees with\nrespect to the sides of the frame. In the primary embodiment, 10\neach coil axis extended across the frame, i.e. perpendicular to\nthe direction of movement of the load, whereas in this alternative embodiment, each coil axis extends in the direction\ndown the frame, i,e,\nto the direction ofmovement of\nthe load. This may have an advantage of simplified construc- 15\ntion, and may be easier to make compact, which can be\nadvantageous in applications where stroke is limited, and\nwhere small size and large force to size ratios are desired.\nFlexure-only actuators are illustrated in FIGS, 9 and 10,\ntheme in this family 20\nand will now be discussed, The\nof stepping flexures is that the permanent magnets andor\n(ideally) the coils, do not move. Rather, the stepping flexures\nin these arrangements move (when a magnetic circuit is\nin order to provide a path for completing the magnetic circuit, as will be explained below. ~h~~~arrangements 25\nhave the advantages of simplicity, compactness andhigh stepping rate (dueto low mass and inertia) andare advantageously\nemployed where these characteristics are desirable, The\narrangements in FIGS, 9 may be rotary or linear elements,\n30\ndepending on how the coils are arranged.\n9a shows a two\ntwo magnet, simp1e moving\nflexure element arrangement. In this arrangement, it can be\nseen that the magnets are not disposed in the moving part of\nthe actuator, but are\nabove and\nthe moving 35\npart. If the flux bypass On the top\nis\nby\nactivation of its electromagnetic coil, the flexure only element\nin the center of the figure will move upwards to contact the\nupper race surface to provide the flux from the upper magnet\na path to\nits magnetic circuit\' This accom~lished, 40\nthe upper\ncan be turned Off and the flexure Only\nremain\nin place against the upper race surface.\nThis is because of remnance forces in the upper coil core\nupper magnet flux, as \'pposed to remace forces\nin the flexure Only\nupper magnet fluxes. 45\nThroughout this process, the lower\nis\nbecause\nits flux\nis\nits magnetic flux. When the lower\nmagnet\'s coil is activated, the lower magnet flux circuit is\nand it looks to\nits magnetic circuit\nattracting the flexure Only\nin the\nOf the figure 50\ndownward.

In this way, switching the\ncan move\nthe flexure-only element up and down.\n55\nFIG. 9 b is a variation of FIG. 9a, and may be used in linear\nactuators, where the coils are wound as top and bottom coils\nunder the respective magnet, and above the flexure-only elemerit. The FIG. 9 b embodiment may also be used in rotary\nactuators, where the coils are a set of top and a set of bottom 60\npancake coils, that is, where each coil of the sets is wound\npancake fashion, into and out of the page under the respective\nmagnet, and above the flexure only element.\nFIG. 9c varies the arrangement of FIG. 9 b by wrapping the\nflexure element around a single magnet, resulting in one 65\nmagnet rather than two, albeit at the price of complicating the\nflexure-only element.\n\n24\nFIG. 9d extends the arrangement of FIG. 9c by using two\nsplit magnets. This allows thinmagnets to be usedto perform\nwith a force comparable to thick magnets.\nFIG. 10 varies the arrangement of FIG. 9d to simplify the\nflexure element but, at the price of complicating the magnet\nand flux bypass arrangement. Here split magnets are used\nabove and below the flexure-only moving element, with\nrespective pancake coils sandwiched between its respective\nmagnet and the flexure-only moving element. If current is\napplied to the bottom coil in the direction out of the Page, the\nelement goes down and sticks.\nThin magnet circuit alternative embodiments will now be\ndiscussed, with reference to thin magnet circuits illustrated in\nFIGS. l l a - c , and split thin magnet circuits illustrated in\nFIGS. 12 and 13.\nFIG. l l a Shows a single thin magnet arrangement with\nwrap-around keepers.

If the upper\ngaps\nblocks the upper flux return, the flux will travel down the right\nhand side wrap-around, jump the lower right hand gap, travel\nfrom \'ght to left through the lower flux return, across the\nlower left hand gap, and from left to right\nthe\nsouth pole where it completes the magnetic circuit.

In this arrangement, flux returns, and their\ncoils, and gaps, are on the left and right hand sides of the\nfigure. Accordingly, the magnet motion is to the left or to the\nright,\nFIG, l l c shows an arrangement having asymmetric keepers, essentially a combination of FIGS, l l a and lib, in which\nthe magnet can be selectively driven up or down. In this\nconfiguration, the two gaps and their forces are either both on\nthe left (magnet up) or both on the right (magnet down), In\ninstances where this force arrangement makes the actuator\nkinematics unstable, flux insulator elements can be added as\nshown in the figure in the upper left and the lower right,\nh o t h e r way to correct this is addressed in FIGS, 12, using\nsplit thin magnet circuits,\nFIG, 1za illustrates an arrangement having a single active\npole pair, This arrangement uses wrap-around lower flux\nreturns, along with split thin magnets, to emulate the actions\nand perfomance of the FIG, 1\nembodiment, but with\nwhat may be cheaper and simpler thin magnets,\nFIG, 12b illustrates an arrangement referred to as a remnance switch, In this arrangement, the wrap-around lower\nflux return is replaced with a simpler version, but depends on\nutilizing the\nin the flux return cores, and the keepers\njoining the poles of the thin magnets together, As explained in\nthenotes FIG, 12b, this arrangement constitutes amawetic\nremnance switch, and a single coil can be wrapped around the\nin a side winder linear actuator configuration, ~ l t ~ ~ natively, two separate rotary pancake configured coils can be\nused for rotary actuator implementations,\nFIG. 13 illustrates a split thinmagnetic circuit arrangement\nwith a single split flux return circuit in combination with split\nthin magnets. This makes possible another version of flexureonly actuators, albeit with the coils wrapped around the flexures, as shown. This alternative may be useful for limited\nstroke actuator implementations.\nThe primary embodiment is illustrated as an actuator having two stepping elements. However, the invention is not\nlimited to this particular number of stepping elements. There\n\n26\n\n25\n\nmay be applications where it would be preferable to have\nembodiment of the embodiment of FIGS. 1, 2 and 3 .

This has the advantage of reducing the\nment stepping flexure according to the invention, as would be l o tendency to "walk" when moving between races, which may\napparent to one skilled in the art, one of which is illustrated\nbe an issue with the embodiment using flat keeper surfaces\n(180 degrees).
