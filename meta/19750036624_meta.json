Rawinsonde releases were made at 54 upper-air stations in two thirds of the eastern U.S. at 3-hr intervals for a 24-hr period. Radar data were obtained from 11 stations located near the center of the observational area, and as many data as possible were collected from the Nimbus 5, NOAA 2, ATS-3, and DMSP satellites. The present paper provides an overview of the experiment and describes how the user community can obtain copies of the data.", "title": "Atmospheric variability experiment /AVE II/ pilot experiment", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-08T03:13:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19750036624, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Turner, R.
