So I would suggest that the country take a look at some of the national educational institutes that we have in the military. There are eight or nine of them The National War College, Industrial College of the Armed Services, and so forth. We need to have a National Space Institute that has some kind of Federal Charter. Its purpose would be to make available the intellectual resources necessary for the human exploration of space. It would have this as a single purpose. It would be a place where the appropriate knowledge, the experience, and the intellectual energy could be focused on this single goal. It would have the status of other national colleges. It would also be a virtual college or a university, and it would be collaborative with colleges and universities and other learning institutions all across the country and perhaps the world. Experts on space from almost any corridor could participate and contribute to what this institute would do. It also would have very strong business participation. We would have folks from industry come to this environment, learn, go back and work, and then come back and teach. It would be a means for individuals to become more proficient in the technical engineering operations, as well as the business and political aspects of space exploration. Such a national space institute also would need to establish and maintain close contact with ongoing development and operations in human space programs.", "title": "Preparing for New Challenges", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-07T10:56:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20060021506, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Shepherd, William"}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Headquarters", "location": "Washington, DC United States"}}, "id": "6158351b3c2b4078b6b638b5349b3866"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-27T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20060021506, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20060021506, "id": "1132ba8478cc4e44900211abdea21068", "publicationName": "Looking Backward, Looking Forward: Forty Years of US Human Spaceflight Symposium", "publicationDate": "2005-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20060021506.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20060021506/downloads/20060021506.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20060021506/downloads/20060021506.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20060021506/downloads/20060021506.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
