In some cases, significant temporal variations\nof global interest occur over time scales as small as a few tens of seconds,\nand certain classes of pulsations have characteristic\nperiods of a few\nseconds. Ideally, it would be useful to have a global network continuously sampling at data rates of a few hertz or more. However, present needs\nof most of the scientific community\ncan be met with data continuously\nacquired at rates of 1 sample per second, with allowances for data rates\nof 10 samples per second for specific coordinated campaigns.\nAn excellent beginning for real-time recording from land magnetic\nobservatories\nhas been the INTERMAGNET\nproject, which uses four\nsatellites to relay digital magnetic data from about 25 observatories to four\nground Geomagnetic\nInformation\nNodes (GINs).\nDevelopment\nof the\nglobal network envisaged here would require the installation of additional\nobservatories.\nSome of these new observatories\ncould be established at\nsites selected for other purposes: at STEP sites, at\n(very-long-baseline\ninterferometry [VLBI], Satellite\nor GPS) geodetic Fiducial Laboratories\nfor an\nScience Network (FLINN) geodetic stations of the\n\nthe Crustal Dynamics\nLaser Ranging [SLR],\nInternational\nNatural\nUnited States or other\n\ncountries, or at Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology\nor other seismic network stations.\nOcean bottom installations\n\n(IRIS)\ncan be\n\nlocated on transoceanic communication\ncables that have recently become\navailable to the scientific community.\nIn addition to the observatory\nnetwork, there is a critical need for a\nportable network facility to measure magnetic variations\nfor induction\nstudies and for studying the ionosphere and magnetosphere.\nFor regional\nstudies of sources in the magnetosphere,\nsites must be spaced on the order\nof the height of the ionosphere or greater (from approximately\n100 to\n1,000 km or more).

By the\nlate 1980s, however, measurements\ndropped to the level of the 1950s in\nspite of the utility of these data to a number of geophysics\nVast areas of the ocean basins are still grossly undersampled.\n\ndisciplines.\nThese data\n\nare essential not only in reconstructing\npatterns of plate motion but also\nin developing\nmain field reference models (for example, the IGRF),\nbecause they are often acquired in regions where no other data exist.\nWith the advent of the satellite-aided\nGPS, the accuracy and usefulness of\nsuch data are greatly increased.\nThe U.S. Navy and the Defense Mapping Agency\ndata bases that cover continent-sized\nareas of the oceans.\n\nhave classified\nThese data are\n\nof excellent quality for science and, if released in usable form, would be\nof great benefit to marine geophysics.\nSimilarly,\nindustry-acquired\nmagnetic data are proprietary.\nIn some areas of the world, no other\nmagnetic data exist, aside from either military or industry sources. These\ndata would be helpful in constructing\nregional-scale\nmagnetic maps for\nresearch purposes or in updating the IGRF to develop more accurate\nmodels in the areas covered by the data. They could be filtered or averaged to maintain their scientific usefulness while protecting the proprietary interests of the source.\nThe needs of the scientific community will not be met by simple addon activities (for example, "ships of opportunity")\nor by gaining access to\nclassified or proprietary data; new surveys are necessary.

In addition, one needs to consider the stability and interconnectedness\n(pore geometry) of conducting fluids (aqueous and partial melts), and\ngrain-boundary\nphases (such as graphite and sulfides). In order to relate\nstudies on small laboratory scale samples to understanding\ncrustal- and\nupper-mantle-scale\nbulk conductivities\nin the Earth, it is necessary to\nmodel the bulk electrical response of composite materials and networks.\n\nOBSERVATIONAL ANDFACILITIES\nNEEDS\n\n59\n\nRecommendations\nA modern,\nwell-distributed\nsystem of observational\nfacilities,\nincluding land and ocean floor observatories\nas well as satellite, aircraft,\nand ship-based facilities, is essential for the collection of geomagnetic data\nto address the problems outlined in this report. Collection of prehistorical\ndata is also essential for understanding\nthe long-term behavior of the\ngeomagnetic field. The order of the following\nimply a priority ranking.\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nA coordinated\n\nrecommendations\n\neffort should be undertaken,\n\nperhaps\n\ndoes not\n\non a phased\n\nbasis, to complete the ground-based\nglobal magnetic observatory\nnetwork at the density required for this geomagnetic\ninitiative.\nThe installation of approximately\n20 island stations and 25 oceanbottom stations would be a major step forward in developing this\nnetwork in support of ongoing work to update the IGRF and for\nmagnetospheric\nand solid-Earth induction studies.\nThe community of solid-Earth\nand space scientists should work with the\nrelevant government agencies to develop detailed implementation\nplans for the full network and to address funding and management\nissues. They should also address issues such as location of sites,\ndata resolution (for example, 12 bit versus 16 bit; 0.05- versus\n0.5-nanotesla\ninstrument\nnoise levels), acquisition\nrates, and\naccessibility to the data by the scientific community in quasi-realtime.\nExpanding\nglobal\nreal-time\nnetworks\nsuch\nas\nINTERMAGNET\nshould be considered as a means of implement\xe2\x80\xa2\n\ning this global network.\nThe needs of the scientific community for high-quality magnetic\ndata can be met with the release of classified and propriety data\nand with a coordinated\nprogram to collect new data.\nSpecial\nefforts should be made to communicate\nto the DOD and to\nindustry\n\nthe usefulness\n\nand mutual benefits\n\nof making\n\nclassified\n\nand proprietary data available to the scientific community.\nThe\ngeomagnetic\ncommunity\nshould take advantage\nof "ships of\nopportunity"\nand long-range\naircraft\nfor surveying\nselected\ncontinental areas and vast areas of the ocean basins, particularly\n\n60\n\nTHE NATIONALGEOMAGNETIC\nINITIATIVE\nin thesouthernceans,\no\nantarctica,\nandtheArctic.A high-altitude\n(20km)surveyovertheUnitedStates houldbeundertaken\ns\nfor\nbaseline\ncontrolandfor regional harting.

The combination of near-real-time\navailability of magnetic observatory data provided by global networks and\nlow-cost mass storage media offers exciting possibilities for the research\ncommunity.\nHowever, these advances also present problems\nfor the\nmanagement\nof data sets, including problems with data quality and the\nproliferation\nof multiple versions of data sets. It is possible that irreplaceable data bases could be lost because of the lack of a general consensus\nwithin the geomagnetic community about how they should be managed.\nThe scientific community must clearly recognize the need for stewardship\nof data that are fundamental for research.\nThe basic issues regarding availability of geophysical data have been\naddressed in several reports of the National Research Council, including\nthose of the Committee on Data Management and Computing (CODMAC)\n(1982, 1986, 1988), GeophysicaIData:\nPolicy Issues (1988), and Solving\nthe Global Change Puzzle (1991).\nThe present report emphasizes\nthe\nimportance\nof effective availability of geomagnetic\ndata and associated\ndata products through national data centers, World Data Centers, and\ndistributed data centers.\n\nData,\n\nMetadata,\n\nData\n\nQuality,\n\nand\n\nFormats\n\nHigh-quafity, well-documented\ndata sets are necessary for the success\nof geomagnetic\nresearch.\nProcedures must be established to assure the\nquality of both the observations themselves and the metadata (information\ndescribing the data) and to assure that these data are machine-readable.\n\n61\n\n62\n\nTHE NATIONAL\n\nGEOMAGNETIC\n\nINITIATIVE\n\nThe use of data for research provides an effective test of its quality.\nThe experiences\nof the researchers\nin the use of data are a valuable\ncomponent of the quality-control\nprocess.\nScientific peer review of data\nis another valuable component of the quality-control\nprocess.\nIn addition to information about data quality, the documentation must\ndescribe the data set contents,\ninstrumentation,\nprocessing,\nand data\nformats.\nBecause geomagnetic\ndata are used by several scientific\ndisciplines that employ different nomenclature,\nthe documentation\nscheme\nmust contain a data dictionary in which all scientific and technical terms\napplicable to geomagnetic\ndata are clearly defined.\nGiven the diversity of sources of data required for geomagnetism,\nit\nseems unlikely that a single data format could be used. However, it may\nbe possible to use one of several established data formats.\nSoftware\nsystems are already available to do this.\nAfter the data are collected, prepared, and stored in the system, their\navailability and relevant properties must be made known to interested\nscientists.\nSome mechanisms\nhave been established\nto do so.\nThe\ninteragency\nGlobal Change Master Directory\nprovides the scientific\ncommunity with high-level information about data availability and access.\nNASA is the lead agency in the development\nof the Master Directory,\nwhich is supported by all of the U.S. agencies involved with geomagnetic\ndata and by many foreign governments.\nMetadata needed for the Master\nDirectory are being put into the Directory Interchange\nFormat.\nUse of\nthis standard for geomagnetism\nwill simplify scientific access to data.\n\nData\n\nCenters\n\nThe are several relevant issues surrounding\nthe use of national\ncenters for managing geomagnetic data bases. They include the following:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nthe complementary\ncenters;\n\nroles of centralized\n\nversus\n\ndistributed\n\ndata\n\nDATA\n\nMANAGEMENT\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n63\n\nthe problem of converting the volumes of\nbeing archived at the World Data Centers\nthe urgent matter of "data rescue," that\nacquisition, and archiving of geomagnetic\nbeing lost or destroyed; and\nthe stewardship of geomagnetic data.\n\nBoth centralized\n\nand distributed\n\ndata centers\n\nanalog data currently\ninto digital form;\nis, the identification,\ndata sets in danger of\n\nhave advantages\n\nfor\n\nmanaging geomagnetic data. Centralized data centers, funded by federal\nagencies, offer the stability required to preserve the data for posterity.\nDistributed\ndata systems provide close contact with experts who are\nknowledgeable\nabout the data.\nCombined centralized\nand distributed\nsystems can provide the advantages of both.\nThe World Data Centers currently house massive quantities of analog\ndata, such as magnetograms\non microfilm and tabular data\nrecords. These data need to be converted into digital electronic\n\non paper\nform. In\n\naddition, many data bases are in danger of being lost or destroyed; steps\nmust be taken to ensure that this does not occur. Not all data in each data\ncenter are duplicated at other centers. Thus, if records at one center are\nlost, there might be no means to recover them.\nFurthermore,\nthe sole\ncopies of many data sets that are the results of completed projects--data\nnever sent to any data center--may\nbe stored, with or without cataloging,\non shelves or tape cabinets at research institutions.\nScientific personnel\nare needed to identify and retrieve such data for inclusion in the general\ngeomagnetic data base. A window of opportunity now exists for rescuing\nthese various data sets through cooperative efforts with colleagues in other\ncountries,\n\nparticularly\n\nin the Commonwealth\n\nof Independent\n\nStates.\n\n64\n\nTHE NATIONALGEOMAGNETIC\nINITIATIVE\n\nData Availability\nData are being made available to users in a variety of ways. Increasingly, users require that data from many locations be made available in as\nnear to real time as possible.\nUsers want to retrieve these data through\non-line systems.\nThe availability of geomagnetic\ndata in real time is an\nimportant objective, but it also presents some significant problems.\nFor\nexample, data must be retrieved from the observatories\nover satellite\nnetworks,\nand can contain many spikes, gaps, time shifts, and other\nquality problems that have to be corrected before the data can be used for\nresearch. The INTERMAGNET\nprogram is currently implementing\nsuch\na near-real-time\ncapability from a worldwide\ndistribution\nof magnetic\nobservatories,\nand is dealing with many of the operational difficulties that\naccompany such a program.\nOn-line data access is\nis very appealing to users\ntheir computers.\nBut large\nrequire large storage spaces\n\ncurrently available for some applications and\nwho can simply download data directly into\ndata bases that are continually being updated\nand can sometimes be labor-intensive.\nThere\n\nis a need to provide existing digital data in a form that is long-lasting,\ninexpensive,\nand compact, such as CD-ROMs.\nFor longer-term\nneeds,\nselection of the storage medium must allow for random access and\noperation on multiple computer platforms.\nNOAA, USGS, and other\nagencies are currently distributing large-volume data bases on CD-ROMs,\nbut many data are not yet available on this medium.\nIn view of the\nlimited lifetime, cost, and vulnerability\nof magnetic\nrepresent a very cost-effective way to distribute data.\n\nDerived\nDevelopments\n\nin technology\n\ntape,\n\nCD-ROMs\n\nProducts\nhave revolutionized\n\nthe collection\n\nand\n\nanalysis of geomagnetic\ndata.\nIt is now feasible to monitor a global\ndistribution of observatories\nin real-time and generate better products at\nincreased temporal resolution.\nBoth the magnetospheric\nring current\nindex, Dst, and the auroral ionospheric electrojet index, AE, can now be\n\nDATA\n\nMANAGEMENT\n\n65\n\ndetermined more effectively and disseminated more rapidly. A polar cap\nindex is now possible, and a new family of power spectra indices could\nbe developed.\nThe understanding\nof the physical processes coupling the\nsolar wind and the geomagnetic field has progressed to the point that solar\nwind data are critical for deriving magnetospheric\nmodels and for making\naccurate forecasts of impending activity.\nMathematical\nmodels and charts are among the more important\nproducts derived from measurements\nof the Earth\'s magnetic field. These\ntools provide information\nneeded for the protection of life and property,\nfor commercial\nactivities,\nand for scientific research.\nGeomagnetic\nmodels, which are based on millions of field measurements,\nare a\nnecessity for safe navigation.\nThey are built into the navigation systems\nof thousands of civilian and military aircraft, ships, and boats.\nModels\nand charts of the main field are routinely used for processing magnetic\nsurvey measurements\ntaken in the search for minerals and petroleum.\nThey are used to calculate the paths of cosmic rays, to orient spacecraft,\nand to find the positions of field-line conjugate points.\nThese products\nrequire\na continuing\nabundance\nof high-quality\ngeomagnetic\nfield\nmeasurements.\n\nRecommendations\nHigh-quality,\nwell documented data sets are essential for the success\nof geomagnetic\nresearch.\nThe following recommendations\naddress the\nstewardship\nand distribution\nof geomagnetic\ndata.\nThe order of the\nrecommendations\ndoes not imply a priority ranking.\nProcedures\nshould be implemented to assure the quality of both\nthe observations\nthemselves\nand the metadata\ndescribing\nthe\nnature of the data:\ncontents, instrumentation,\nprocessing,\nand\nformats.\nData and metadata should be recorded\nin machinereadable form. The best way to learn about the quality of data is\nfor investigators\nto use it for scientific research.\nResearch that\n"exercises" data sets should be encouraged,\nand the experiences\n\n66\n\nTHE NATIONALGEOMAGNETIC\nINITIATIVE\noftheresearchers\nshould\nbecapturedspartofthequality-control\na\nprocess.Scientific\npeerreviewof datashouldbea keycomponentof the quality-control\nprocess.A source\nbookshouldbe\ndeveloped\ntoencourage\nmoreinterdisciplinary\nuseofgeomagnetic\ndata.

Initially, attention was focused\non benefits of communication\nand coordination\namong activities and\nprograms of federal agencies. As planning for the workshop progressed,\nit became clear that the entire geomagnetic\ncommunity\nshould be\ninvolved.\n\nInternational\n\nScientific\n\nUnions\n\nand Programs\n\nThe study of the Earth is intrinsically global. This was recognized\nby geologists,\ngeodesists,\nand geophysicists\nin the nineteenth\ncentury.\nDuring the past hundred years, the need for global collaboration\nin\ngeosciences\nhas become\naxiomatic;\nmany mechanisms\nhave been\ndeveloped to encourage international cooperation in Earth sciences. Much\ninternational\ncooperation in science takes place under the nongovernmental International\nCouncil of Scientific Unions (ICSU).\nBy the latter part of the nineteenth century, international\nexpeditions\nand exchange of data were common in the geosciences.\nThis led to\ndevelopment\nof international\nmechanisms\nfor ongoing cooperation\nin\ngeophysical and geological sciences. Seismic and magnetic observatories\nwere being established worldwide.\nThese de facto global networks of\nmagnetic and seismic observatories\nled to international\nagreements\non\nmeasurement\nstandards and data exchange. These international activities\nled to the formation\nof an international\norganization\nthat was the\npredecessor of the modern International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics (IUGG). The objectives of IUGG are the promotion and coordination\n\n68\n\nCOMMUNICATION\n\nAND\n\n69\n\nCOORDINATION\n\nof physical, chemical, and mathematical\nstudies of the Earth and geospace\nenvironment.\nIUGG now consists of seven essentially\nautonomous\nassociations; one of these, the International Association of Geomagnetism\nand Aeronomy (IAGA), is principally concerned with geomagnetism.\nInternational collaboration\nin the study of the Earth received a major\nboost from the International\nGeophysical Year (IGY), which took place\nfrom 1957 to 1959. There were at least two major legacies of the IGY:\nfirst, the IGY demonstrated\nthe possibility for international\ncooperation\namong all countries in a scientific endeavor of common interest and value.\nSecond, the World Data Center System was established.\nGeomagnetism\nwas a major program of the IGY.\nFrom IGY to the present,\ngeomagnetism\n\nhas been\n\na major\n\nor\n\nsignificant component of many international programs and organizations.\nTwo bodies with major interests in geomagnetism\nwere established in the\n1960s: the ICSU Scientific Committee on Space Research (COSPAR) and\nthe ICSU Scientific Committee on Solar-Terrestrial\nPhysics (SCOSTEP).\nBoth of these bodies sponsor programs involving geomagnetism.\nThe\nInternational\nMagnetospheric\nStudy took place from 1976 to 1979. The\nSolar-Terrestrial\nEnergy Program (STEP) of SCOSTEP is an important\ncurrent program.\nThe International\n\nLithosphere\n\nProgram\n\n(ILP),\n\nwhich was instituted\n\nby IUGG and lUGS (International Union of Geological Sciences) in 1980\nas the successor\nto the International\nGeodynamics\nProject, seeks to\nelucidate the nature, dynamics, origin, and evolution of the lithosphere,\nwith special attention\nThe International\n\nto the continents and their margins.\nLithosphere Program is being carried out under the\n\nguidance of the Inter-Union Commission on the Lithosphere (ICL), which\nwas established under the auspices of ICSU. The ILP includes a broad\narray of topics that naturally\ncall for collaborative\nefforts between\ngeologists and geophysicists.\nEmphasis has been given to "key projects."\nGeomagnetic problems play a role in several of the ILP key projects.\nIUGG also established\nthe SEDI (Studies of the Earth\'s Deep\nInterior) program.\nEarth\'s geomagnetic\n\nThe SEDI program\nfield and dynamo\n\nhas a major\nprocesses.\n\nconcern with the\nA corresponding\n\n70\n\nTHE NATIONALGEOMAGNETIC\nINITIATIVE\n\nnationalprogram,Cooperative\nStudiesof the Earth\'sDeep Interior\n(CSEDI),hasbeen\nproposed y NSF.\nb\nInternational\nscientificorganizations\nsuchas IUGG (particularly\nIAGA and the SEDI program),SCOSTEP,\nCOSPAR, ndICL have\na\nactivitiescloselyrelated various\nto\naspectsf thegeomagnetic\no\ninitiative\nandwouldprovideforums international\nfor\npresentation theresults.\nof\n\nNational\n\nand\n\nInternational\n\nActivities\n\nGeomagnetic\nresearch and development\nin the United States draws\nits constituents from a multidisciplinary\nbase of geophysicists,\nphysicists,\nand geologists affiliated with the major scientific institutions (academia,\nstate and federal agencies, and private industry) throughout the country.\nResearch\nprograms\nare presently\nsupported\nby NSF, USGS, DOE,\nNOAA, NASA, and DOD (through the Navy, the Air Force, and the\nDefense Mapping Agency). The missions of these agencies encompass a\nwide variety of geomagnetic research and development activities.\nThese\nactivities\ninclude producing\nglobal magnetic charts; monitoring\nand\npredicting the effects on satellite electronics and space communications\nof\nmagnetic\ndisturbances,\nradiation,\nand\nparticle\nfluxes\nin\nthe\nmagnetosphere;\nand magnetic navigation.\nThe basic research activities\nsupported by the federal agencies include all four areas of geomagnetic\nresearch outlined in this report: main field and core processes, electromagnetic induction in the solid Earth and oceans, lithospheric\nmagnetic\nanomalies, and magnetospheric\nand ionospheric processes.\nMagnetic information\nfor charts and maps is developed by USGS,\nNOAA, and the Navy. The Navy and NOAA (and the Coast Guard) are\nresponsible for maintaining and improving navigational safety; the Navy\nprovides magnetic information for this purpose.\nMagnetic models of the\ngeomagnetic\nfield are developed by the Navy (in conjunction\nwith the\nBritish Geological Survey), NASA, and USGS. The models developed\nby these three organizations\nare the main inputs to the International\nGeomagnetic Reference Field, produced every 5 years by the International\nAssociation of Geomagnetism\nand Aeronomy.\n\nCOMMUNICATION\n\nAND COORDINATION\n\n71\n\nMagnetic\nimaging of the Earth is a new initiative that requires\nparallel\ninitiatives in data acquisition,\ndissemination,\nand synthesis.\nClearly, there will be scientific and practical benefits in making this a\ncollaborative\neffort among a number of the major agencies, including\nNASA, NSF, USGS, NOAA, the Navy, Air Force, and DOE.\nAll of\nthese agencies now perform geomagnetic research that could benefit from\nthe improved\ncommunication\nand coordination\nenvisioned\nin this\ngeomagnetic\ninitiative.\nLithospheric\nmagnetic anomalies are studied by NASA, NSF-sponsored academic\nscientists,\nthe USGS,\nand industry\ngeologists\nand\ngeophysicists.\nSome work in this area is also sponsored by the Navy and\nNOAA.\nMagnetic induction studies are supported by NOAA (from the\nClimate and Global Change Program), USGS, DOE, DOD, and NSF.\nThe geoscience\ncommunity\nhas established\na fertile environment\nwithin which geomagnetic studies can flourish. A number of national and\ninternational\ngroups have established clear research priorities focusing on\nstudies of the Earth\'s\nlithosphere.\nThis includes exploration\nand\nassessment of natural resources (for example, minerals,\nhydrocarbons,\nand ground water), characterization\nof the crust for waste repositories,\nscientific drilling of the oceanic and continental crust, a new national\nprogram in continental dynamics, the MARGINS and RIDGE programs\n(Margins: A Research Initiative for Interdisciplinary\nStudies of Processes\nAttending Lithospheric\nExtension and Conversion; Ridge Inter-Disciplinary Global Experiments),\nand international projects in collaboration\nwith\nJapanese,\nItalian, and French groups, and with the European\nSpace\nAgency involving low-altitude, Earth-orbiting\ngeopotential\nsatellites.\nMajor scientific advances in geomagnetic research require cooperation.

It is\nthe interaction of the solar wind with the geomagnetic field that creates the\nEarth\'s magnetosphere.\nThe magnetosphere,\nin turn, stores energy from\nthe solar wind and dissipates it sporadically\nin geomagnetic\nstorms and\nsubstorms that accelerate large fluxes of energetic charged particles and\ndrive large electrical currents; these currents, in part, are diverted down\ninto the ionosphere.\nUpper-atmosphere\nwinds also generate\nglobal\ncurrents through dynamo action as the conducting ionosphere is moved\nthrough the geomagnetic\nfield.

Collisions are so infrequent in most of this region that\nits electrical conductivity\nis nearly infinite.\nBecause of this condition,\nmagnetic fields and very-low-energy\nparticles are frozen together, and\nwhen the plasma moves, so too do the magnetic field lines that thread it.\nFinite energy particles also drift in gradients of the magnetic field. These\ndrifts are energy- and charge-dependent\nand thus must produce electrical\ncurrents. These currents create magnetic fields that add to the geomagnetic field originating within the Earth. Because of these currents, the total\nfield in the magnetosphere\ndeparts radically from what is calculated by\nextrapolating\nthe Earth\'s internal field to distances greater than several\nEarth radii.\nThe outer boundary of the magnetosphere\nis sharp and well defined\nat a distance in the sunward direction of about 10 Earth radii.\nIt is\nproduced by a sheet of electrical\nEarth\'s field outside the boundary\n\ncurrent that cancels almost all of the\nwhile doubling it inside. This current\n\nlayer is termed the magnetopause,\nand it separates the geomagnetic field\nfrom the field and plasma of the solar wind.\nAt the magnetopause\nthe\nsolar wind interacts with the Earth\'s field by two major processes:\nviscous interaction and magnetic reconnection.\nThe viscous interaction\noccurs along the flanks of the magnetosphere\ntransferring\nsolar wind\nmomentum\nto closed field lines inside the magnetopause.\nThese field\nlines flow tailward and create boundary layers with flows internal to the\nmagnetosphere.\nMagnetic reconnection,\non the other hand, allows the\ninterplanetary\nmagnetic field (IMF) to merge with the geomagnetic field\nnear the subsolar point, These field lines are then transported by the solar\nwind over the poles and laid back behind the Earth as a long, cometlike\ntail.\nIn the tail these field lines eventually\nreconnect and return by\ninternal flows to their origin. These flows produced by the viscous and\nthe dominant reconnection process are termed magnetospheric\nconvection.\n\n78\n\nTHE NATIONAL\n\nGEOMAGNETIC\n\nINITIATIVE\n\nThe stretching\nof the field lines through convection produces the tail\ncurrent that flows partly on the magnetopause\nand partly across the\ninterior of the magnetic tail.\nThe rate at which the magnetic field in the solar wind reconnects\nwith the geomagnetic\nfield depends on the angle between the solar wind\nfield and the Earth\'s field. Only when the IMF is southward,\nthat is,\nantiparallel to the Earth\'s field, does a strong interaction occur. Because\nthis angle is constantly changing, the level of magnetospheric\nconvection\nalso changes.\nThese fluctuations make it possible to energize and trap\nparticles in the inner portions of the magnetosphere,\ncreating the radiation\nbelts.\nThe rapid drift of protons to the west and electrons to the east\ncreates a torus of westward current around the Earth, known as the ring\ncurrent.\nThe electric field produced in the magnetosphere\nby convection is\nprojected onto the ionosphere along magnetic field lines. However, the\nionosphere\nhas finite electrical\nconductivity\nand, consequently,\nan\nelectrical current flows parallel to the electric field. This is called the\nPedersen current.\nSince magnetospheric\nconvection is a closed cycle,\nsome field lines flow tailward and some sunward. The boundary between\nthese flow regions projected onto the ionosphere is called the convection\nreversal. The electric field is divergent along these flow lines; therefore,\nso is the ionospheric\ncurrent.\nThis is possible only if field-aligned\ncurrents flow in or out of the reversal regions to satisfy current continuity.\nThese field-aligned currents are known as Region I Birkeland currents.\nThey link the magnetopause\nand tail currents to the Earth\'s ionosphere\nand are the primary source of energy that drives ionospheric phenomena.\nA second source of electric field in the magnetosphere\nis the rotation\nof the Earth. The plasma polarizes so that the resulting electric field is\neverywhere orthogonal\nto the magnetic field. In the absence of other\neffects, the combination\nof electric and magnetic fields would cause\ncharged particles to corotate eastward with the Earth.\nHowever, when\nadded to the dawn-dusk magnetospheric\nelectric field, this second field\nsource imposes a fundamental asymmetry on the magnetosphere.\nA result\nof this is that electrons drift closer to the Earth on the dusk side and ions\ncloser on the dawn side.\n\nAPPENDIX\n\nA:\n\nTOPICAL\n\nWORKING\n\nGROUP\n\nREPORTS\n\n79\n\nThe electric field projected onto the ionosphere causes the plasma at\nthe feet of convecting field lines to drift just as the magnetospheric\nplasma\ndoes. However, the ionosphere is not fully ionized, and drifting charges\ncollide with atmospheric\nneutrals.\nThe collision rate relative to the\ngyrofrequency\nis much higher for positive ions than for electrons, and\ntherefore they drift more slowly than electrons.\nThis produces a current\nin a direction opposite the drift. This current is orthogonal to both the\nmagnetic and electric fields; it is called a Hall current. The geometry of\nthe Hall current system is the same as that of ionospheric convection, but\nwith the opposite sense. It is a two-cell system flowing sunward across\nthe polar cap and antisunward in the dusk and dawn sectors of the auroral\noval. The concentrations\nof current in these sectors are known as the\neastward (dusk) and westward (dawn) electrojets.\nMost of\ndisturbance seen on the ground at high latitudes is produced\ncurrent system.\nBecause of their solenoidal geometry, the\ncurrents do not create large ground disturbances.\nFluctuations in the interplanetary\nmagnetic field carried\nwind affect the rate of dayside reconnection, and hence cause\n\nthe magnetic\nby this Hall\nfield-aligned\nby the solar\ncorrespond-\n\ning fluctuations\nin the convection electric field and all of the current\nsystems mentioned above. These changes are highly filtered and delayed\nbecause of the large inductance\nof the field-aligned\ncurrent systems.\nNightside reconnection\noccurs in the center of the tail current sheet, but\nits onset is delayed relative to the dayside. When reconnection begins in\nthe nightside,\nit explosively\nreleases the energy stored in the tail field.\nThis release is accompanied\nby a new current system that temporarily\ndiverts a fraction of the cross-tail current along field lines that close\nwestward across the midnight ionosphere.\nThis current is known as the\nsubstorm current wedge. Multiple substorms driven by a long interval of\nfluctuating\nsouthward\nIMF cause many particles to be energized and\ntrapped in the radiation belts.\nThese longer intervals of enhanced\nconvection and intense ring currents are called magnetic storms.\n\n80\n\nIonosphere\n\nTHE NATIONAL\n\nGEOMAGNETIC\n\nINITIATIVE\n\nand Atmosphere\n\nAt heights of 80 to 1,000 km, the ionosphere and upper atmosphere\nrespond strongly to the electric fields and currents of magnetospheric\norigin.\nThe rapidly drifting ions set neutral winds in motion through\ncollisional coupling, and the resistive dissipation of electrical energy, or\nJoule heating, can be the dominant energy input to the high-latitude upper\natmosphere.\nDuring magnetic substorms, winds approaching sonic speeds\ncan be generated, and the heating is sufficient to raise the temperature\nof\nthe upper atmosphere by hundreds of kelvins. The expanded atmosphere\nresults\nin order-of-magnitude\nincreases\nin the drag on near-Earth\nsatellites, altering their orbits and affecting their orientations.\nThe global\nupper-atmosphere\ncirculation during magnetic substorms and storms is\naltered, resulting in a changed chemical composition and large changes in\nionospheric\ndensity.\nThe high-speed winds can significantly\nfeed back\nupon the magnetospheric\nelectrodynamics\nthrough ionospheric dynamo\naction. Hence, the ionosphere cannot be viewed simply as a passive sink\nfor magnetospheric\nenergy.\nAccurately explaining these various effects\nrequires complex simulation models of upper-atmosphere\nand ionospheric\ndynamics that take into account the characteristics\nof electrodynamic\nenergy input from the magnetosphere.\nEven when magnetospheric\nenergy inputs to the upper atmosphere\nand ionosphere are weak, electric fields and currents are generated in the\nionosphere by the dynamo action of the ever-present neutral atmosphere\nwinds.\nBecause the ionosphere\nis electrically\nconducting,\nits motion\nthrough the geomagnetic\nfield produces an electromotive\nforce (EMF).\nThis EMF results in electrical current flow and the establishment\nof space\ncharges and electric fields. Typically, two large cells of current flow in\nthe sunlit ionosphere,\na counterclockwise\ncell in the northern magnetic\nhemisphere\nand a clockwise\ncell in the southern hemisphere,\neach\ncontaining\non the order of 105 amperes.\nCurrent also flows along\ngeomagnetic\nfield lines between the two hemispheres\nbecause of the\nextremely\nhigh conductivity\nalong the magnetic field.\nMost of the\nhorizontal\ncurrent in the ionosphere\nflows below 200 km, although\n\nAPPENDIX\n\nA:\n\nTOPICAL\n\nWORKING\n\nGROUP\n\nREPORTS\n\n81\n\nmeasurable currents can also be found at higher altitudes when the plasma\nand neutral densities are large, as at solar maximum in the afternoon.\nA portion of the upper-atmosphere\nwind that drives the dynamo\nresults from the diurnal variation in absorption\nof solar ultraviolet\nradiation in the thermosphere.\nAnother portion is driven by upward\npropagation of global atmospheric waves, particularly atmospheric\nsolar\ntides with 24- and 12-hour periods, but also planetary waves of longer\nperiods and lunar tides of 12.4-hour periods. Geomagnetic data from the\nglobal network of stations thus record effects of these winds, which are\ndependent\non the state of the middle atmosphere\nand can provide\ninformation about spatial and temporal variations in middle-atmospheric\nconditions.\nThe highly anisotropic nature of ionospheric conductivity can result\nin strong Hall polarization\nelectric fields, especially at the magnetic\nequator where the horizontal geometry of magnetic field lines inhibits the\ndischarge of these fields. The electric field drives a strong current along\nthe magnetic equator on the dayside of the Earth, the equatorial electrojet,\nthat produces an enhancement\nin magnetic perturbations\non the ground\nand at satellite altitudes. The latitudinal variation of the currents is closely\ntied to the mean eastward electric field and to the vertical variation of\nwinds in the thermosphere,\nso that analysis of latitudinal profiles gives\nimportant information\nabout the dynamical state of the ionosphere\nand\nupper atmosphere at low latitudes.\nThe external sources such as ionospheric current systems also induce\nelectrical currents to flow in the conducting\nlithosphere.\nStudies by\nmagnetotelluric\nand global geomagnetic\nmethods have investigated the\nEarth\'s electrical conductivity to depths of about 1,000 km. The resulting\nfields add to the magnetic field measured at the Earth\'s surface and at\nlow-Earth orbit. It has recently become possible to refine the calculations\nof magnetospheric\nand ionospheric current processes by accounting for\nthese\ninduced\ncontributions\nonce the external\nionospheric\nand\nmagnetospheric\nmagnetic fields are known.\nImplementation\nof these\ncorrections\nwill allow for more accurate measurements\nof the currents\nflowing\n\noverheard\n\nin the ionosphere.\n\n82\n\nGeomagnetic\n\nTHE NATIONALGEOMAGNETIC\nINITIATIVE\n\nPulsations\n\nand Transients\n\nSinusoidal variations in the Earth\'s magnetic field with time scales\non the order of seconds to several minutes have been observed for over\na century. More recently, it has been recognized that these pulsations, or\nhydromagnetic\nwaves, may be used as diagnostics\nfor magnetospheric\nplasma processes at high altitudes and as means of dissipating solar wind\nand magnetospheric\nenergy at ionospheric\naltitudes.\nGeomagnetic\npulsations with periods of minutes include field resonances and transients\nin the global current system. Short-period\npulsations, on the other hand,\nare thought to be electromagnetic\nion cyclotron waves. These waves are\nrecognized\nas having a significant role in transporting\nenergy between\nvarious constituents\nof magnetospheric\nplasmas.\nBeginning in the solar wind, energy is coupled to magnetospheric\npulsations through several mechanisms.\nWave power is generated by\nturbulence outside the magnetopause\nnear noon and by Kelvin-Helmholtz\nwaves caused by velocity shear along the flanks of the magnetosphere.\nThis wave power propagates inward and couples to toroidal (azimuthally\npolarized)\nfield-line\nresonances.\nIons energized\nin the nightside\nmagnetosphere\nare injected into the ring current\nduring periods\nof\nincreased magnetic activity and drift westward through the late evening\nand dusk toward noon, providing energy for poloidal (radially polarized)\nfield-line resonances, storm-time compressional\nwaves, and electromagnetic ion cyclotron waves. Other, less structured waves are focused along\nmagnetic field lines directly into the polar cusp and cleft regions.\nThe study of pulsations has been pursued for several reasons in\naddition to seeking an understanding\nof their underlying\nmechanisms.\nFirst, it allows detailed comparisons\nbetween plasma physics theory and\nobservation\nin ways not possible in laboratory experiments.\nExamples\ninclude\ndrift and ballooning-mode\ninstabilities,\nbounce resonances,\nshear-driven\ninstabilities\n(such\nas Kelvin-Helmholtz\ninstabilities),\nnonlinear\nwave-wave\ncoupling,\nand ion cyclotron wave instabilities.\nPulsation studies also allow for a better understanding\nof mechanisms\nof\nwave mode coupling (for example, from either traveling or globally\nresonant compressional\nwaves to transverse waves and back again), of\n\nAPPENDIX\n\nfeedback\n\nA:\n\nTOPICAL\n\neffects\n\nWORKING\n\ndue to local,\n\nGROUP\n\ndiurnal,\n\nREPORTS\n\nand seasonal\n\n83\n\nvariations\n\nin iono-\n\nspheric parameters, and of the importance of spatial boundaries as sources\nand/or transmitters\nof plasma waves.\nSecond, such studies can provide diagnostics of dynamic and static\nfeatures within the Earth\'s plasma environment.\nMany dayside highlatitude magnetic pulsations appear to be related to plasma interactions\noccurring in the magnetospheric\ncusp/cleft regions, which link the highlatitude ionosphere to the outer boundary of the Earth\'s magnetosphere,\nor to interactions occurring directly at these remote boundaries.\nBecause\nsatellite orbits allow only brief crossings through this complex and critical\nregion, ground-based magnetometers\nprovide the only means of obtaining\nsynoptic coverage of cusp/cleft processes.\nThird, geomagnetic pulsations are used for electromagnetic\nsounding\nof the solid Earth. By sensing the induction effects of external pulsations,\none can infer considerable detail about properties of the underlying crust\nand mantle.\nIn the following sections we discuss the present-day knowledge and\nimportant\nunresolved\nquestions\nassociated\nwith magnetic\npulsation\nactivity, beginning with the lowest frequencies.\nLong-Period\n\nand Impulsive\n\nEvents\n\nLong-period (3- to 15-minute) waves observed at latitudes connected\nmagnetically\nto the outer boundary of the magnetosphere\nare designated\nas being in the Pc 5 period range. These waves, with amplitudes of tens\nof nanoteslas, include both solitary and continuous-wave\ntrains, with an\noccurrence distribution spread throughout dayside local times from dawn\nto near dusk. As a result of intensive study of ground-based observations,\nmany of the magnetic pulsations in this category have been found to be\nassociated with traveling ionospheric plasma vortices produced by moving\nfilamentary field-aligned currents that appear to originate near the inner\nedge of the low-latitude\nboundary\nlayer.\nThe generation\nof solitary\nvortices appears to be related to transients generated by changes in the\ninterplanetary\nmagnetic field or solar wind pressure.\nThe more continuous events, on the other hand, appear to be caused by velocity shear\n\n84\n\nTHE NATIONALGEOMAGNETIC\nINITIATIVE\n\ninstabilities at the maynetospheric\nboundary (most likely the\nKelvin-Helmholtznstability). In this interpretation,\ni\nthesepulsations\nappear\ntobetheground\nsignaturefdriven\no\nmagnetospheric\nreorientations\ntraveling\ntailwardalong\nthemagnetopause\natmagnetosheath\nspeeds.\nHow\nfrequentlytheseoccur and under what circumstances\nremain open\nquestions.\nIrregular\n\nVariations\n\nVariations of large-scale field-aligned and ionospheric currents can\nalso cause large, less structured variations in magnetic fields near the\nEarth\'s surface.\nThose with longer periods, known as Pi 2 pulsations,\noften resemble an impulsive ringing and are associated\nwith auroral\nelectron precipitation.\nNear local midnight, Pi 2s are associated with\nauroral substorm onsets and can reach amplitudes of tens of nanoteslas.\nAt times these signatures\ncan be observed\nworldwide.\nHow they\npropagate to equatorial latitudes and to all local times is not yet understood.\nHigher-frequency\nirregular pulsations (Pi 1), extending to and\neven past local noon, appear to be much more highly localized, and are\napparently\nproduced\nby transient currents in the ionosphere\ndue to\nvariations\nin ionization and conductivity.\nThese latter pulsations are\nclearly associated\n\nwith the aftermath\n\nof substorm\n\nactivity.\n\nPc 3-4 Pulsations\nPulsations\nfeature of the\n\nin this period range (20 to 50 seconds) are a ubiquitous\ndayside magnetosphere,\noccur over a wide range of\n\nlatitudes, and typically have amplitudes of from 1 to 10 nanoteslas.\nTheir\ndependence\non IMF orientation\nand magnitude\nsuggests a driving\nmechanism related to "upstream waves" and/or processes at the subsolar\nbow shock, which exhibits oscillatory behavior when its shock geometry\nbecomes quasi-parallel.\nThe mechanism that relates upstream phenomena\nto dayside field-line resonances in this same frequency band has been\nstudied for many years but still is not understood.\nHowever, there is\n\nAPPENDIX\n\nA:\n\nTOPICAL\n\nWORKING\n\nGROUP\n\nREPORTS\n\n85\n\ngrowing evidence that processes in the cusp/cleft may play a central role\nin the transmission process.\nMultipoint studies have shown that Pc 3 pulsations are most intense\nin the dayside cleft regions, and recent observations\nof relations between\nmagnetic,\noptical, and very low frequency (VLF) modulations\nat Pc 3\nfrequencies, with clear IMF control of all three types of signals, suggest\nthat at least along field lines connecting to cusp/cleft latitudes there are\nsome fundamental unexplored interactions between various kinds of waves\nand plasma populations.\nSimultaneous\nand carefully\nsynchronized\ninformation\nfrom magnetometer\narrays at a variety of longitudes and\nlatitudes will be especially valuable in determining\nwhether cleft and/or\ncusp sources are involved in the transmission\nof these pulsations to the\nground at lower latitudes, and can help toprovide\nfurther tests of the\nproposed wave-entry mechanisms from an upstream wave source.\nPc 1-2 Emissions\nPulsations\n\nin this frequency\n\nrange (0.1 to 10 hertz) are the result\n\nof\n\ninstability in the hot, anisotropic ion distributions that are regularly set up\nwithin the magnetosphere\nand within the boundary layers, magnetosheath,\ncleft, and cusp. As these ions become unstable to the growth of electromagnetic ion cyclotron waves, their energy and anisotropy decrease as\nwaves are emitted along magnetic field lines.\nThese waves (with\namplitudes\nusually\nless than 1 nanotesla)\nserve two functions\nin\nmagnetospheric\nresearch.\nFirst, they can function as diagnostics\nof\nremote processes\nand particle populations\nif their source regions and\nparticle populations can be independently\ndocumented.\nSecond, they are\nindicative of processes responsible for precipitating\nmedium-energy\nions\nout of trapped orbits.\nOf particular\ninterest are high-latitude\nPc 1-2 bursts, frequently\nobserved in association\nwith traveling vortex events, which appear to\noriginate on cusp or cleft field lines. It is possible that the field compressions often associated with these burst events increase the magnetic field\nstrength and/or alter the panicle distributions\nsufficiently to make ion\ncyclotron waves grow. It has also been proposed that Pc 1-2 observations\n\n86\n\nTHE NATIONALGEOMAGNETIC\nINITIATIVE\n\ncanbeusedasindicators localfieldlinesthatmapto magnetospheric\nof\nboundaries.\nRecent\nreports\nindicate\nthat,for example,\nunstructured\n0.15to 0.4-hertz\nnoiseis seldom\nobserved orethana fewdegrees\nm\nfrom the\ncusp.\nScientific\n\nIssues\n\nTo Be\n\nAddressed\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Solar\nWind-Magnetosphere-Ionosphere\nCoupling,\nMany\naspects ofdayside solar wind-magnetosphere-ionosphere\ncoupling are still\npoorly understood.\nThe physical processes to be elucidated include\nvarious forms of reconnection,\nparticle diffusion, and wave penetration of\nthe magnetopause.\nTwo dimensional magnetometer\narrays at high\nmagnetic latitude (approximately 60 \xc2\xb0 to 80 \xc2\xb0 ) could provide data to map\nthe space-time\ndevelopment\nof ionospheric\ncurrents\nproduced\nby\nreconnection\nand other energy/momentum\ntransfer processes in the\ndayside and nightside magnetosphere.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Substorm Electrodynamics.\nThe detailed coupling of the\nmagnetotail to the nightside ionosphere is not adequately modeled. Even\nthe relative importance of the two regions and the peculiar quasi-periodic\ndevelopment of the aurora and westward\nelectrojet during substorm\nexpansion phase remain to be explained. An all-digital, real-time auroral\nnetwork magnetometer array is needed to define the auroral electrojet\nindices at all levels of activity and to track the details of electrojet\ndevelopment.\nObservations from a smaller number of stations should be\nmonitored in real time to detect Pi 2 pulsations, which signal the onset of\nsubstorm activity.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Global Magnetosphere\nModels.\nImproved representations of\nthe sources of external magnetic field are important for further progress\nof the geomagnetic community.\nBecause the solar wind is changing with\ntime, these models must be parameterized to include solar wind dynamic\npressure and substorm phase as well as dipole tilt. Magnetic data from\npast, present, and future spacecraft collected in a unified data base and\nannotated with time, location, solar wind conditions, and internal state of\nthe magnetosphere\n\nwould provide the basis for such a model.\n\nAPPENDIX\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nA:\n\nTOPICAL\n\nWORKING\n\nGlobal Ionospheric\n\nGROUP\n\nDynamo.\n\n87\n\nREPORTS\n\nMore realistic\n\nmodeling\n\nof the\n\nglobal ionospheric dynamo, using realistic simulations of thermospheric\ndynamics,\nwould allow full advantage\nto be taken of the wealth of\ninformation contained in geomagnetic data relating to quiet-day variations.\nNot only would these global data place strong constraints on the uncertain\nmodel inputs, but they would guide the evaluation of day-to-day, seasonal,\nand long-term variations in the wind systems that propagate upward from\nthe middle atmosphere.\nIn addition to improving our understanding\nof\nthermospheric\nand middle-atmospheric\ndynamics, such studies may also\nshed light on long-term changes in the global atmosphere.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Ionospheric Electric Fields. An improved model of ionospheric\nelectric fields, taking into account their dependence on magnetospheric\nand thermospheric\nconditions, is a critical need for a variety of upperatmospheric studies and applications.\nSimulation models of thermospheric\nand ionospheric\ndynamics\nhave shown that winds, temperatures,\nand\nelectron densities depend very sensitively on the electrodynamic\nconditions. It is also becoming apparent that there is significant feedback on\nthe magnetospheric\nelectrodynamics\nfrom winds generated\nat high\nlatitudes.\nFurther\nmodeling\nof coupled\nmagnetosphere-ionosphere\ndynamics is essential to help clarify the nature of these interactions.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Magnetic Pulsations as Magnetospheric\nDiagnostics.\nThere is\ngreat promise that magnetic pulsations can be used as diagnostics to\nprovide real-time monitoring of plasma densities throughout large regions\nof geospace,\nto identify magnetic\nfield lines connecting\nto the\nmagnetospheric boundary, and to warn of substorm onset.

Today little progress can be made unless\nmagnetic field data are simultaneously\navailable from the solar wind,\ngeosynchronous\norbit, the magnetotail,\nlow-Earth\norbit, and ground\nstations distributed around the globe.\nMagnetic indices derived from the ground data are used to characterize the level and type of activity so that certain time intervals can be\nchosen for detailed study and long-term changes in the magnetosphere\nand\nionosphere\ncan be detected.\nThese indices are also used to select\nmeasurements\nfor the construction of average models of the external field.\nA primary use of these average models is to extrapolate the observations\ntaken at various ground observatories\nand by remote-sensing\nspacecraft\n(such as those that image the aurora) into the magnetosphere\nfor comparison with higher-altitude\nsatellite observations.\nAnother major use of\nmagnetic data is to accurately model the currents that produce the ground\nmagnetic variations.\nThe ability to quantitatively\nremove these external\ncontributions\nto the field measured at the Earth\'s surface would greatly\nenhance the ease and accuracy with which a variety of geomagnetic\nmapping\n\ntasks could be carried\n\nout.\n\n90\n\nTHENATIONALGEOMAGNETIC\nINITIATIVE\n\nObservational\nConcerns\nFor the purpose of measuring and understanding\nthe magnetic fields\nand currents in the magnetosphere\nand ionosphere, a suite of magnetometers on spacecraft and on the ground is required.\nThis requirement can be\nsatisfied only by maintaining\nthe existing platforms, augmenting\nthem\nwith modern instrument packages, and adding some new platforms.\nSpacecraft\nThe\n\nsource\n\nObservations\nof all energy\n\nto the magnetosphere\n\nenergy to the ionosphere is the solar\netary magnetic\nfield.\nIn order to\nactivities,\nit is essential that solar\ntemporal resolution) be continuously\n\nand much\n\nof the\n\nwind, with its imbedded interplansupport research and operational\nwind data (with at least 5-minute\navailable to users in near real time.\n\nPresently Interplanetary\nMonitoring Platform (IMP)-8 provides such data,\nbut the data are collected by NASA only about one-third of the time and\nare not available to the users until months after they are taken. The Wind\nsatellite will soon be launched by NASA to provide IMF and solar wind\ndata, in support of the International\nSolar-Terrestrial\nPhysics (ISTP)\nProgram, but only a limited amount of data will be available in real time.\nA permanent platform for monitoring the IMF and solar wind that could\nbe deployed following the ISTP Program is clearly needed.\nInside the magnetosphere\nthe geomagnetic field is now monitored at\ngeosynchronous\norbit by magnetometers\non the Geostationary\nOperational\nEnvironmental\nSatellites (GOES). Unfortunately\nthe normal complement\nof two GOES satellites does not allow for a complete coverage in local\ntime. Another magnetometer\nat geosynchronous\norbit is needed 6 to 8\nhours in local time from both GOES East and GOES West.\nBetween geosynchronous\norbit and the solar wind, there is no\nrequirement\nfor continuous magnetic field measurements,\nbut significant\nscientific and operational benefits would result if more satellites in this\nsector of space carried a magnetometer\nsuitable for scientific measurements of the magnetospheric\nmagnetic field.\n\nAPPENDIX\n\nA:\n\nTOPICAL\n\nWORKING\n\nGROUP\n\n91\n\nREPORTS\n\nExisting satellite data sets provide a foundation for the development\nof models of the magnetospheric\nfield, but the effectiveness of addressing\ncritical\nments.\n\nscientific problems depends on the acquisition of new measureBetween geosynchronous\nand low-Earth orbit, available scientific\n\nmagnetic field data are inadequate for developing accurate models of the\nmagnetospheric\nfield.\nThe Combined Release and Radiation\nEffects\nSatellite (CRRES) mission was providing suitable data when its mission\nwas terminated prematurely\nby a subsystem failure. When new scientific\nand operational\nmissions in this region of space are developed,\nthey\nshould include a research-grade\nmagnetometer\nto support modeling of the\nmagnetospheric\nfield as a function of IMF direction,\nand other effects.\nLow-Earth\norbit measurements\n\nsubstorm activity,\nof the electrical\n\ncurrents flowing between the magnetosphere\nand the ionosphere are also\nessential to the modeling of both regions.\nSince the characteristic\ntime\nscale of the individual substorm phases is approximately\n20 minutes, a\nmeasurement\nof the disturbance field is needed at intervals of 20 minutes\nor less.\n\nPresent\n\nplans call for two magnetometers\n\non Defense\n\nMeteoro-\n\nlogical Satellite Program (DMSP) satellites. To obtain the required time\nresolution,\na magnetometer\non at least one more spacecraft is required.\nThe NOAA/TIROS\n(Television\nInfrared\nObservation\nSatellite)\nare\nexcellent platform candidates to fulfill this need.\nIn low-Earth\norbit there is also a critical need for a dedicated\ngeomagnetic\nfield-mapping\npayload\nmagnetic field of the Earth.\nThe\nrapidly enough that a new model\nGround-based\nmagnetic observatory\nbut for the best possible model over\n\nto update the models of the internal\nEarth\'s magnetic field is changing\nis required every 5 to 10 years.\ndata are important for this updating,\nthe whole Earth, satellite data are an\n\nabsolute requirement.\nMagsat (1979-1980)\nwas the last satellite that\ncompletely\nmet this need.\nMagnetometers\non board the Dynamics\nExplorer\n(DE)-2 (1981-1983)\nand the Polar Orbiting Geomagnetic\nSatellites (1990-1993),\nfor example, provided data that were useful.\nHowever, their utility was limited by the lack of a high-accuracy\nattitude\ntransfer system and an absolute scalar magnetometer.\nMagnetometers\non\nboard future satellites of the DMSP series will provide useful data sets,\nbut again, with limited accuracy.\n\nThere are possibilities\n\nfor future NASA\n\n92\n\nTHE NATIONAL\n\nGEOMAGNETIC\n\nmissions with fully capable instrument packages,\nprogressed\nbeyond feasibility and design studies.\nGround\n\nINITIATIVE\n\nbut none of these has\n\nStations\n\nIn order to characterize the disturbance magnetic field induced in the\nsolid Earth due to currents in both the ionosphere and magnetosphere,\ndata from ground-based\ngeomagnetic\nobservatories\nare essential.\nThese\ndata are used both for modeling the complete current system and for the\ncreation of magnetic indices that give a measure of the level of large-scale\nmagnetic\ndisturbances.\nIn addition\nto the standard\nground-based\nobservatories,\ntemporary observatories are also necessary for characterizing the disturbance\nwith the finer detail required for research purposes.\nIn order to meet future research and operational requirements,\nall existing\nstations need to be maintained.\nIf a particular country is having difficulty\nin supporting its existing stations, the international community should take\nsteps to preserve these vital resources.\nMany of the existing observatories\nalso need to be upgraded.\nAll\nobservatories\nmust be able to record the magnetic field digitally at a\nsampling rate of at least 1 vector per minute, and the data must be put into\na data base accessible in real time through a computer network such as the\none being developed\nfor the International\nReal-Time\nGeomagnetic\nObservatory\nNetwork (INTERMAGNET).\nAt least half of the highlatitude stations should have the capability to record data at higher sample\nrates for studies of magnetic\npulsations\nand other rapidly varying\nphenomena.\nMany types of pulsations, for example, Pc 3-4, Pc 5, and Pi\n2, can be adequately resolved with 1-second resolution measurements.\nThe study of Pc 1-2 class pulsations,\nat least 2 vectors per second.\nStation\n\nhowever,\n\nrequires\n\nsample\n\nrates of\n\nSpacing\n\nFor adequate spatial resolution (by data from permanent magnetic\nobservatories)\nof the main field and field variations due to magnetospheric\nand ionospheric sources, the latitudinal spacing of the stations should be\n\nAPPENDIX\n\nA:\n\nTOPICAL\n\nWORKING\n\nGROUP\n\n93\n\nREPORTS\n\nno greater than 10 \xc2\xb0 at equatorial and middle latitudes.\nIn the auroral\nregion and the polar cap, a latitudinal spacing of 3 \xc2\xb0 or less is desirable.\nWhere possible, the spacing between stations in local time should be no\nmore than 2 hours. At present, large gaps exist in coverage, such as in\nthe Pacific Ocean and in Siberia.\nFor specific research purposes,\ntemporary stations are needed with a spacing of approximately\n100 km in\nboth latitude and longitude.\nSuch stations would be in place for periods\nof 1 to 5 years. In the past, such temporary stations have been custombuilt by various scientific groups and later dismantled.\nWith the\ndevelopment\nof modern fluxgate magnetometers\nand the advent of lowcost data retrieval, storage, and communications\nhardware, appropriate\nagencies should procure reusable geomagnetic observatory stations. The\navailability of several dozen would support many important studies at\nreasonable cost.\nData Retrieval\nIt is desirable\n\nto have as much data as possible\n\nreturned\n\nin near real\n\ntime and deposited in a central processing\nfacility or cataloged into a\ndistributed system.

The Swedish mining compass was\nused successfully\nas early as the 1600s to search for iron ores, and dip\nneedles were used until the middle part of this century. Although limited\ngeological applications of ground-based magnetic surveying were realized\nprior to World War II, the postwar development\nof the aeromagnetic\nmethod and the development of the marine-towed magnetometer\nhave had\nthe greatest impact on Earth science. Aeromagnetic data over continental\nareas, often in conjunction with gravity data, have helped in the preparation of many geological maps and have often provided the only economic\nmeans of investigating geology at depth.\nOver oceanic areas, seafloor\nspreading anomalies revealed by airborne and shipborne\nsurveys were\ncritical for the development\nof the plate tectonic paradigm.\nRecent\nsurveys continue to be the primary tool for estimating the age and relative\nmovement of plates. The power of the magnetic method as a geological\nmapping tool has increased\nwith time; high-resolution\nsurveying\nin\nconjunction\nwith modern processing and graphic routines continues to\nimprove our knowledge of the oceanic and continental lithosphere.\n\nAppendix A2 was largely developed by the following workshop group:\nRichard Blakely (Group Leader), J.

Perhaps the most unique attribute of\nthe magnetic method is that it can provide the added dimension of time to\ngeophysical analyses.\nFor example, the age of most of the oceanic crust\nis known from magnetic analyses.\n\nSocietal\n\nApplications\n\nIn addition to elucidating large-scale geological structures, magnetic\nanomaly studies can also delineate features associated with mineral or\nhydrocarbon accumulations;\nsuch features include igneous intrusions, fault\nzones, salt domes, and anticlines.\nExamples of prospective hydrocarbon-\n\n102\n\nTHENATIONALGEOMAGNETIC\nINITIATIVE\n\nproducing\nbasinsdiscovered y their magnetic\nb\nexpression\nincludethe\nNavarinBasinin Alaskaandthe NorthSeabasins.Magnetic\nanomaly\nmaps areas here\nin\nw\nthebasement concealed\nis\nbysedimentary have\ncover\nstimulated\nandfocused\nmineralexploration manyareas theworld.\nin\nof\nCrustal magnetization\nis sensitive to metamorphism\nand hydrothermal\nalteration;\ntherefore, magnetic contrasts in the crust reflect variations in\nthermal and geochemical history that may be diagnostic for certain energy\nand mineral environments.\nNational\n\nprograms\n\nto evaluate\n\nnatural\n\nhazards,\n\nto characterize\n\nenvironmentally\ncontaminated\nareas, and to permit safe disposal of\nradioactive\nwaste all benefit from magnetic\nanomaly studies.\nFor\nexample, the active New Madrid Seismic Zone lies within an Eocambrian\ngraben of the Mississippi\nEmbayment.\nThe graben is completely\nconcealed by younger sedimentary rocks and is identified primarily on the\nbasis of magnetic\nanomalies.\nSimilar magnetic\nanomaly\nanalysis\ndelineates\nconcealed structures of the San Andreas fault zone, which\nrepresent major hazards to urban areas. Evaluation of candidate sites for\ncritical hazards (for example, dams, nuclear reactors) is aided by the\nsubsurface information revealed by magnetic anomaly maps. Changes in\nmagnetic anomalies over historical time scales may indicate magmatic\nand/or tectonic activity.\nPermanent monitoring of the magnetic field at\nvolcanoes and fault zones could potentially reveal systematic behavior\nprior to catastrophic events and contribute to prediction efforts. Magnetic\nanomalies due to cultural sources, such as metal pipes and drums, can\nhelp to locate and characterize\nareas of contamination.\nDespite the obvious scientific and societal benefits of magnetic\nanomaly studies, the question of who will perform this work in the future\nremains unclear.\nThe decrease in the ranks of entry-level\nresearchers\nthreatens to produce a critical shortage of trained personnel to perform\nbasic and applied geomagnetic\nresearch.\nThis trend appears to be\ncorrelated with the decrease in securely funded academic, federal, and\nindustry-related\npositions.\nThe strongest indicator of the impending\nshortage of geomagnetists\nis the decrease in number of graduate students\nspecializing in the field.

The response of the lithosphere to major plate reorganizations is recorded in structures, such as propagating rifts, microplates,\nand\nmigrating transform faults, defined mainly by their magnetic signatures.\nIntraplate deformation,\ndefined by nonclosure of plate circuits, has been\ninvestigated by detailed aeromagnetic surveying with track spacings on the\norder of 20 km.\nShipborne,\nsatellite, and deep-tow studies are being used to define\nthe systematic differences of magnetization\nwith age in the oceanic crust\nand thus define characteristics\nof the recording process. Such differences\nmay reflect variables of the source layer (for example, thickness\nor\nchemical composition),\npaleofield intensity, or processes operative during\nthe evolution of the crust. At the finest scale, anomalies that are barely\nresolvable at the sea surface occur between major anomalies in seafloor\nspreading profiles (the so-called tiny wiggles); these tiny wiggles are\nfinally being exploited for information concerning the shortest resolvable\n\n104\n\nTHE NATIONAL\n\nGEOMAGNETIC\n\nINITIATIVE\n\ntime\nscales\nof\ncore-generated\ngeomagnetic\nfield\nbehavior.\nMagnetization-versus-age\nstudies are complemented\nby detailed studies of\nalong-strike variations in the magnetization\nof the ridge crest.

Inversions of airborne and satellite\ndata have been performed to estimate the depth and configuration\nof the\nCurie-temperature\nisotherm.\nThis difficult inverse problem has the\npotential to advance understanding\nof the geothermal and tectonic setting\nof regions and to guide the systematic exploration of geothermal resources, but meaningful\nresults will require an understanding\nof magnetic\nmineralogy at depth.\nIn addition to constraining the modern-day tectonic framework of an\narea, analysis of lithospheric\nmagnetic anomalies can lead to improved\nunderstanding\nof the historical record of tectonic activity. This historical\nperspective\ncan provide\ninsights into paleogeography\nand evolving\nterranes, thereby illuminating paleoclimatic\nconditions.\nThe continental margin is a particularly fruitful area of investigation.\nThe ocean-continent\nboundary\nfrequently displays a distinct magnetic\nanomaly in airborne and shipborne\nsurveys.\nSubstantial\ncontroversy\n\nAPPENDIX\n\nA:\n\nTOPICAL\n\nWORKING\n\nGROUP\n\nREPORTS\n\n105\n\nexists, however,\nconcerning\nits expression\nin satellite data.\nfundamental lithospheric\nboundary deserves additional study.\nGlobal and Regional\n\nThis\n\nStudies\n\nSatellite magnetic anomaly data and large-scale airborne surveys are\nbeing utilized to investigate the regional magnetization\nof the Earth\'s\nlithosphere.\nThese studies show spatial/temporal\nvariations\nin the\nthickness, thermal gradients, and composition\nof the lithosphere.\nThe\nPolar Orbiting Geomagnetic Observatory\n(POGO) and Magsat missions\nhave mapped the Earth\'s magnetic field at a resolution sufficient to reveal\npreviously unknown intermediate- to long-wavelength\n(400-to-4,000-km)\nlithospheric\nmagnetic anomalies\nwithout complications\nfrom secular\nvariation.\nMany of these anomalies were previously unknown because\nregional anomalies\ndefined by aeromagnetic\ndata suffer from biases\ninherent\nin patching together individual\nsurveys.\nThe most serious\nproblem is our imprecise knowledge of the reference field.\nLack of anomaly resolution\nin existing satellite data and lack of\ninformation\non the magnetic properties\nof the lower crust and upper\nmantle limit the interpretation\nof these satellite-derived\nregional magnetic\nanomalies.\nUnresolved\nexternal field contamination\nalso degrades the\ndata quality.\nRegional magnetic anomalies\nalso can be studied with\nproperly compiled airborne and shipborne data. Upper-crustal\nsources\nmay produce anomalies\nin these low-altitude\ndata that coalesce into\nregional anomalies when observed at satellite heights.\nComparison\nof\nsatellite and near-surface\ndata is essential for proper interpretation\nof\nregional anomalies.\nLikewise, knowledge of the satellite anomalies is required to properly\ncalibrate regional compilations\nof low-level data.\nThus, magnetic studies at both satellite and near-surface\nheights are\ncritical and will enable interpretation\nof geological and tectonic evolution\nof the lithosphere,\n\nespecially\n\nin concert\n\nwith global gravity\n\nand topogra-\n\nphy data sets.\nThe Magnetic Anomaly Map of North America published in 1987 has\nproven invaluable\nfor first-order\nregional interpretation\nof magnetic\nstructure.\nPerhaps its greatest contribution\nhas been the promotion of\n\n106\n\nTHE NATIONALGEOMAGNETIC\nINITIATIVE\n\ninterchangeetweeneophysicists\nb\ng\nandgeologistsn addressing\ni\nregional\ngeological\nproblems. et,inspiteof itsgeneral\nY\napplication,\ntheU.S.part\nof themaphasmanyshortcomings\ncaused y disparateurveyspecificab\ns\ntions,nonuniform\ntreatment regional ields,andinadequate\nof\nf\ncoverage\nin someregions.Studies long-wavelength\nof\nmagnetic nomaliesf the\na\no\nUnitedStates ased\nb\nonthismaparedifficultor impossible ainlydueto\nm\nproblems datumshiftsbetween\nin\nmerged\nsurveys.Now is clearlyan\nappropriate\ntimeto evaluate\nthismapquantitativelynddetermineowit\na\nh\nmightbe improved\nwith existingdataor newlyacquired\nsurveys.

For example, the standard digital representation\nof a magnetic anomaly map required by most analysis techniques is an\nequi-spaced grid.\nThese grids are inadequate for several reasons:\n(1)\ninformation\nis discarded along densely sampled flight lines and must be\ninterpolated\nbetween flight lines; (2) magnetic features are treated as\nthough they are symmetrical;\nand (3) differences of elevation between\npoints are not taken into account.\nIntelligent\nand efficient gridding\ntechniques\nare needed that can accommodate\nasymmetric\nanomalies,\nunequally spaced intervals, differences in elevation, and a curved Earth.\nIn addition, we should consider new ways to analyze data directly without\ngridding.\nNew analysis techniques\ncan take advantage\nof today\'s\nmore\npowerful\ncomputers.\nHighly\ninteractive,\neasily\nvisualized\nthree-dimensional\nmodeling and inversion algorithms should flourish and\nbecome standard practice.\nDevelopment\nof techniques\nthat recognize\npatterns in multiple data sets and associate them with certain geological\nenvironments\nshould continue.\nPreviously developed methods that are\ncomputerintensive, such as space-domain\nfiltering and some spectral\nmethods,\nmay now be more useful because of improved\ncomputer\ntechnology.\nIt is well recognized that synergistic analysis of multiple data sets\nprovides important constraints on interpretation\nof subsurface geology.\nThe synthesis of multiple data sets has generally been treated in qualitative\nways.\nNew computer\ntechnology,\nsuch as geographic\ninformation\nsystems (GIS), can be utilized to handle multiple data sets.\nFuture\n\n108\n\nTHE NATIONALGEOMAGNETIC\nINITIATIVE\n\ndevelopmentshould improve on GIS techniques synthesizing\ns\nby\ninformation\nfromall thedatasets.\nFuture developments analysistechniques\nin\nshould focus on\nfacilitating\nthemodeling\nofmagnetization\ndistributions ndtheinterpretaa\ntion of thesedistributions geological\nin\nterms.

Magnetic surveys over thick sedimentary sections have potential for\ndetailed mapping of (1) faults that offset layers of different magnetization\nor that focus the flow of fluids; (2) structurally\ndeformed beds having\nmagnetization\ngreater or less than that of enclosing beds; (3) lithologic\ncontrasts associated with diapiric salt domes; and (4) zones affected by\ninorganic\nminerals.\n\nalteration\n\nor microbial\n\nproduction\n\nof iron oxide and iron sulfide\n\n110\n\nTHENATIONALGEOMAGNETIC\nINITIATIVE\nIntermediate-depth\n\nand Deep Magnetic\n\nSources\n\nLong-wavelength\nmagnetic anomalies from the lithosphere can be\ngenerally attributed to (1) variations in the thickness of zones of constant\nmagnetization\ncomposition\n\nor (2) contrasting\nmagnetizations\nthat reflect different\nand evolution of the rocks.\nA combination\nof factors is\n\nlikely, but the detailed physical and mineralogical\nbasis for changes in\ndeep-crustal\nand upper-mantle\nmagnetization\nis not well understood.\nIndeed, even fundamental\nmagnetic\nproperties,\nincluding\nthe Curie\ntemperature,\nof deep-seated\nmagnetic minerals are a matter of dispute.\nAn especially challenging and perplexing problem is that magnetizations\ninferred from satellite and regional aeromagnetic anomalies are larger than\nmost magnetizations\nactually measured in rocks. Better understanding\nof\nanomalies from lithospheric sources must come from experimental\nand\ntheoretical research on equilibrium mineral assemblages and chemistry at\nhigh temperature\nand pressure.\nIn addition, experimental\nstudies of the\neffects of temperature\nand pressure\non both induced and remanent\nmagnetization\nof different rock types are needed.\nThe magnetic petrology of rocks from intermediate and deep-crustal\ndepths and the uppermost\nmantle can be studied in three ways:\n(1)\ninvestigation\nof xenoliths from kimberlites\nand from alkalic volcanic\nrocks; (2) measurement\nof rocks from exposed crustal sections; and (3)\ndetermination\nof the likelihood of occurrence of stable magnetic minerals\nin rocks of particular\ncompositions\nby theoretical\nand experimental\nmethods.\nOceanic\n\nSources\n\nIt is well recognized that magnetic anomalies from the oceanic crust\nprovide a record of seafloor spreading,\nyet the magnetization\ncausing\nthese anomalies\nremains incompletely\nunderstood.\nMany enigmatic\nmagnetic features provide clues to the evolution of ocean crust, including\nthe decrease in amplitude away from spreading ridges, the enhanced\nmagnetization\n\nof the Cretaceous\n\nQuiet Zone, and discrepancies\n\nin ampli-\n\nAPPENDIX\n\ntude\n\nA:\n\nTOPICAL\n\nand anomalous\n\nWORKING\n\nskewness\n\nGROUP\n\nREPORTS\n\nin intermediate-\n\n1 11\n\nand short-wavelength\n\nanomalies.\nIrregularities\nin the magnetic anomaly patterns can be attributed to\nmany factors, including the geometry, composition,\nand cooling history\nof intrusive and extrusive rocks; tectonic evolution and setting; spreading\nrate; composition and temperature of hydrothermal\nfluids; geometry and\nduration of hydrothermal convection cells; and positions of the convection\ncells with respect to the spreading ridge or the accreting plate. Clearly,\na better understanding\nof these influences is crucial for mapping and\ninterpreting the geology of the oceanic crust. Such an understanding\nwill\ncome partly from rock magnetic and petrological studies of samples from\ndifferent\ntectonic\nand hydrothermal\nsettings\nand partly from the\npaleomagnetic\nstudy of unaltered rocks of similar age found in outcrop on\nland or in cores from the seafloor.\nA critical question concerns the\nmagnetic mineralogy\nof the deeper magnetic layers and the associated\ndepth to the Curie-temperature\nisotherm:\nwhere is the base of the\nmagnetic oceanic lithosphere?\nExperimental\nwork is needed on the\nmagnitudes and stabilities of secondary remanent magnetizations\n(viscous\nand chemical remanences)\nacquired under the physical and chemical\nconditions of magnetic sources.\n\nProgrammatic\nSeveral operational\n\nand\n\nOperational\n\nConsiderations\n\nissues are critical to the improved\n\nacquisition\n\nand\n\nanalysis of magnetic surveys.

Electrical conductivity (or its reciprocal, resistivity) is\nthe physical property most sensitive to the configuration\nand chemistry of\nthese fluids, particularly at the low concentrations\nexpected geologically.\nTemperature\nand composition strongly influence the mechanical behavior\nof Earth materials where ionic fluids do not dominate.\nIn such situations\nelectrical conductivity again depends strongly on dynamically\nimportant\nconditions.\nThe possible widespread presence of grain- boundary phases,\nsuch as carbon at crustal or mantle depths, has profound implications for\nthe chemical environment,\nand once again, remote sensing of the electrical\nconductivity\nstructure\nis a very relevant tool for understanding\nthe\nevolution of our planet.\nIn addition, there are smaller-scale\nproblems\nof great interest to\nsociety--including\nenergy and resource exploration,\nelectric power grid\nreliability,\nwater quality and waste management--in\nwhich electrical\nconductivity\nof the target or its surroundings\nis a diagnostic physical\nvariable.\nElectromagnetic\nmethods are the only viable way to delineate\nconductivity structure from the Earth\'s surface.\nThus, basic research in\nelectromagnetic\nimaging of subsurface structure has potential for many\npractical benefits.\n\nAppendix A3 was largely developed by the following workshop group:\nJohn Booker (Group Leader), W. Campbell, A. Chave, C. Cox, A. Duba, G.\nEgbert, I. Gough, A. W. Green, L. Hirsch, J. G. Kappenman, L. Law, B.\nNarod, P. Tarits, J. Tyburczy, P. Wannamaker.\n119\n\n120\n\nTHE NATIONAL\n\nGEOMAGNETIC\n\nINITIATIVE\n\nElectromagnetic\nstudies are traditionally separated into oceanic and\nland-based\nstudies.\nAlthough much of the science and many of the\ntechniques\nare very similar for these studies, there are substantial\ntechnological\ndifferences;\noceanic measurements\nare considerably\nmore\ndifficult and more costly to accomplish.\nIn addition, induction caused by\nwater movement in the ocean has no analog on land. The Earth\'s oceans\nare important in the long-term storage and transport of environmental\nheat\nand thus affect our climate. As a good electrical conductor, ocean water\neasily generates\nmeasurable\nelectric fields as it moves through the\ngeomagnetic field. Furthermore,\nat periods longer than a day, the electric\nfields at any point represent a volume average of the motions.\nTherefore,\nelectromagnetic\nmeasurements\nin the ocean are an extremely useful tool\nfor probing large-scale dynamics and monitoring long-term, climatically\nimportant variability of the sea.\nElectromagnetic\ninduction studies of the solid Earth\nsimultaneous\nmeasurements\nof time-varying\nmagnetic\n\ninvolve either\nand electric\n\nfields--in\northogonal\nhorizontal\ndirections\nfor the widely\npopular\nmagnetotelluric\n(MT) method or array measurements\nof the time-varying\nmagnetic field--in three components\nfor the geomagnetic\ndeep sounding\nor magnetic variation (MV) method. Both methods have been employed\non land and on the ocean bottom and have increased our understanding\nof\nthe Earth\'s crust and mantle. The MT method in particular has seen rapid\nadvances in recent years. By contrast, studies of low-frequency\noceanic\nmotions require only measurements\nof the vector electric field. This can\nbe done with dipoles a few meters long or with grounded cables hundreds\nto thousands of kilometers long.\nInterpretation\nof electromagnetic\ndata is usually broken into three\nsteps.\nThe first step involves estimating\nfrequency domain transfer\nfunctions between measured field components\nfrom long time series. It\nis complicated by the fact that the Earth is almost always multidimensional, external sources may not be ideal, and noise processes are often\nnon-Gaussian.\nThe second step uses these transfer functions to obtain a\nrepresentation\nof Earth structure.\nBesides the nonuniqueness\nproblems\nshared by all inversions of incomplete and inaccurate data, this inverse\nproblem is both difficult and numerically intensive because it is unstable,\n\nAPPENDIX\n\nA:\n\nTOPICAL\n\nWORKING\n\nGROUP\n\nnonlinear,\n\nand often multidimensional.\n\n121\n\nREPORTS\n\nHowever,\n\nprogress\n\nin all aspects\n\nof interpretation\nhas been substantial enough in recent years to constitute\na virtual revolution in our ability to image electrical structure.\nLaboratory\nelectrical conductivity\nstudies provide the final critical\nstep, linking models of conductivity\nand the physical and chemical\nprocesses occurring within the Earth. Because conductivity\nis sensitive\nto environmental\nparameters,\ninterpretation\nof conductivity\nmodels\nrequires\na thorough\nunderstanding\nof the mechanisms\nthat control\nconductivity\nunder the limited conditions accessible in the laboratory.\nOxygen fugacity, pressure, and chemical environment\nof surrounding\nminerals can also affect conduction and are particularly\nimportant\nfor\nadequately constraining the thermodynamic\nenvironment\nof the minerals.\nCritical questions remaining\nto be addressed\nrelate to longevity\nand\ninterconnectedness\nof conducting\nfluids (pore geometry)\nand grainboundary\nphases--including\naqueous fluids, partial melts, and carbon--over\n\ngeological\n\ntime.\n\nResearch\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Laboratory measurements\nelectrical\nconductivity\nof rocks\n\nQuestions\nat simulated in situ conditions of the\nprimarily\ncomposed\nof olivine and\n\npyroxene--thought\nto be primary constituents of the upper mantle--are\nas\nmuch as three orders of magnitude lower than conductivity\ninferred from\ninversion of electromagnetic\ninduction data for the outer 200 km of the\nEarth.\nWhat is the reason for this discrepancy\nbetween observed\nconductivity and the measured conductivity of the major mineral phases?\nThe mechanisms\nknown to determine electrical conductivity\ninclude the\nfollowing: composition,\nquantity, and connectivity\nof the fluid; partial\nmelts; carbon and sulfides; and composition, temperature, and mineralogy\nof the crystalline matrix. Given this plurality of ways to explain enhanced\nconductivity,\nwhat independent\nconstraints\nare required to make the\nexplanation unique?\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The evidence for a steep rise in conductivity beginning by 400 km\nis strong.\nRecent work incorporating\nvery long period electric fields\n\n122\n\nTHE NATIONAL\n\nGEOMAGNETIC\n\nINITIATIVE\n\nappears to improve resolution substantially and shows that the rise may be\nsteplike.\nDefinitive interpretation\nof this conductivity increase requires\nadditional\nlaboratory\nstudies of the electrical\nproperties\nof /3- and\n"y-(Mg,Fe)2SiO4 under controlled conditions.\nThe conductivity appears to\nlevel out at around 1 siemens per meter below 800 km, but resolution\ndeteriorates\nrapidly below 1,000 km. How can this depth barrier be\nbroken through?\nAdditional studies of other candidate materials such as\nhigh-pressure\nminerals\nwith varying iron/magnesium\ncontents under\ncontrolled thermodynamic\nconditions are required to interpret conductivities deeper than 800 km.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Can lateral variations in conductivity\nbe delineated at mid-and\nlower-mantle depths? It is known that there are significant differences in\nlong-period response functions at different magnetic observatories.\nBut\nhow much of this signal is due to deep lateral heterogeneity\nand how\nmuch is due to biases associated with shallow structure such as the ocean\nand inadequately represented external source field morphology?\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Can lateral variations\nin conductivity\nin the upper mantle be\nmapped?\nDynamical\nconsiderations\nsuggest that temperature\nand melt\ngradients should produce order-of-magnitude\nlateral variations in conductivity, and existing data support their existence but are often susceptible\nto alternative explanations.\nCan this situation be improved with more\naccurate new data collected in a more systematic fashion? Can it also be\nimproved with application of better methods of interpreting data containing potentially distorting multidimensional\nstructural information?\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Do fluids persist in the deep crust over long geological times? It\nis widely accepted that fluid-rich sedimentary rocks and oceanic crust are\ntransported\nin subduction zones to depths that require dewatering of the\nrocks and conversions to higher metamorphic\ngrade. But what paths do\nthese fluids take in returning to the surface?\nFluids trapped at depth\nwould have enormous importance in the rheology of the lower crust and\nupper mantle.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 What are the mechanical effects of aqueous fluids in the upper\ncrust?

Even at very low frequencies for which the ocean is less than one\nskin-depth\nthick, strong induced currents are prevented\nfrom leaking\ndown into the conductive asthenosphere and deeper mantle by the resistive\nnature of oceanic lithosphere.\nWhere these currents cross a coast into the\nmore resistive continent, more current will flow at shallow depth than is\npredicted\nby the continental\nconductivity\nstructure.\nHowever,\nthe\nobserved coast effect is often less than expected, which may be due to\nshort-circuit conductive paths to the mantle. This can occur at coasts with\nactive subduction or at ancient suture zones. Electromagnetic\nmeasurements are very sensitive to the location and structural details of these\nstructures\nas well as those at ridge crests and active hot spots where\nadditional short-circuiting\npathways may exist.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Can motionally\ninduced electric currents be used to sound the\noceanic lithosphere?\nBarotropic tides in the deep ocean drive vertical\n\n124\n\nTHE NATIONALGEOMAGNETIC\nINITIATIVE\n\nelectriccurrentsthroughtheseafloor.If thesetidescanbe accurately\nspecified\nandtheirmagnetic ndelectric\na\nfieldscanbemeasured,\nonehas\nanelectrical ounding\ns\ntechnique\nthatis especiallyppealing ecause is\na\nb\nit\npreferentiallyensitiveo theconductivity theupperlithosphere. he\ns\nt\nof\nT\nlithosphere inaccessibleMT because\nis\nto\ntheconductive\nocean\nscreensut\no\nthenecessary\nshorter-periodxternal\ne\nsource\nfields.\n\nApplications\nElectrical conductivity plays an important\npractical contexts, including the following:\n\nrole in a wide variety\n\nof\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Understanding\nvolcanic regimes.\nSeismic data have frequently\nbeen interpreted to imply magma bodies in the crust, but electromagnetic\nmethods are much more sensitive to the important variables.

The\nreasons for this rest in the different nature of the data collected by the two\nmethods.\nMV uses an array of simultaneously\nrecording\nthree-component\nmagnetometers\nand is primarily sensitive to the electric current distribution in the Earth and the source region. Because of the volume-averaging\nnature of MV data, there will be a sufficiently long period for deployment\nconfigurations\nso that data will be protected against aliasing of small-scale\nelectrical structures within the array. MV data are therefore ideally suited\nto determining\nlateral structure.\nHowever, the sensitivity of MV data to\nsource current structure requires attention to detecting and eliminating\nnonplanar source fields or correcting for their effects. Decomposition\nof\nMV array cross-spectral\ndensity matrices\npermits isolating uniform\nsources and synthesizing the response of large arrays from smaller ones.\nIf the source is nonplanar and can be determined from the array (which\nmay require regional or global observatories),\nresponse functions closely\nrelated to MT may be estimated.\nBy comparison, MT uses measurements\nof the orthogonal horizontal\nelectric and magnetic fields and is more closely related to conductivity\nthan current.\nThe electric fields include information about conductivity\nheterogeneity\nvery local to the measurement\nsite. This effect persists to\nvery long periods and can be aliased if site spacing is too wide. Thus,\nnew deployment strategies such as electric dipoles placed end to end in a\ncontinuous profile and new analysis techniques such as spatial filtering of\nthe electric field have been developed to detect and mitigate the distorting\n\nAPPENDIX\n\nA:\n\nTOPICAL\n\neffect of shallow,\n\nWORKING\n\nthree-dimensional\n\nGROUP\n\n127\n\nREPORTS\n\nstructure.\n\nMT sensors\n\nhave been\n\ndeveloped\nthat can utilize the background\ngeomagnetic\ncontinuum,\npermitting\ndata to be collected at almost any time.\nComplete\nfield\nprocessing of MT time series in essentially real time now assures that data\nof adequate quality are being collected.\nNew deployment and processing\ntechniques\nusing remote-reference\nsensors\ncan mitigate\nthe biases\nassociated\nwith some forms of noise, particularly\nof cultural origin.\nFurther\ndevelopments\nuse robust statistical\ntechniques\nto deal with\nnon-Gaussian\naspects of the noise.\nThey produce estimates of transfer\nfunctions between the electric and magnetic fields that are more accurate\nand have more reliable error estimates.\nFinally, a variety of methods has\nbeen devised to stably invert the transfer functions for two-dimensional\nstructure.\nNew computer algorithms are greatly accelerating\n(by orders\nof magnitude) the speed with which the necessary computations\ncan be\ndone, and the day seems to be coming when two-dimensional\ninterpretations can be made as the data are collected.\nFinally,\nfully\nthree-dimensional\ninversions are beginning to appear.\nMany of the measurement\nand interpretation\ndevelopments\nthat are\nrevolutionizing\nMT can be extended to MV--wideband\nmeasurements,\nremote-reference\ntechnique,\nin-field processing,\ngeneralized\ninverse\ntheory, and so forth. The most important reason that further advances are\nnot being made with MV is that modern equipment in the United States\nis limited.\nAnother difficulty is that MT fields at a single site are\nobserved to be more highly correlated than MV fields measured between\ndistant sites.\nThus, MT measurements\nresult in more precise transfer\nfunction measurements.\nThe reason for this needs to be understood\nand\nmitigated if possible.\nIt seems likely to be related to stronger effects of\nnonideal\nsources on MV than MT.\nArrays\ncan characterize\nthe\nthree-dimensional\nexternal current distributionthat\ncomplicates interpretation of the induced response to geological\nstructure.\nHowever,\nthe\nthree-dimensional\ncurrents in the ground complicate\nunderstanding\nthe\nmorphology\nof external current systems.\nThus, MV array experiments\ncomplement\nthe needs of the magnetospheric\nresearch field.

This is an important time scale, as\nthere are theoretical reasons to believe that the fundamental\noscillation\nperiod of the dynamo operates in this range. Lavas are of use in obtaining\ndetailed time-histories of the geomagnetic field at select intervals of time.\nOf particular interest are those that measure a reversal transition or a\ngeomagnetic\nexcursion.\n\nAPPENDIX TOPICAL\nA:\nWORKINGGROUP REPORTS\n\n141\n\nThe long-term behavior of the geomagnetic\nfield, on time scales of\nyears or more, is determined\nprincipally\nfrom paleomagnetic\nmeasurements.\nOne area of interest is the average field behavior during\na given polarity interval.\nTo first approximation,\nthe long-term average\nfield direction at any given site is that of a geocentric axial dipole field.\nHowever, general agreement is lacking as to how long it takes for that\nmean field direction to manifest itself.\nIndeed, several studies have\n10 6\n\nsuggested that the time-averaged\nfield contains nondipole components that\npersist throughout\na given polarity interval.\nThe existence\nof such\ncomponents\nwould place a fundamental\nlimitation\non the use of\npaleomagnetic\ndata to determine plate motions and tectonic movements.\nMarine magnetic\nanomalies\nprovide a first-order\nrecord of the\npolarity transitions for the past 200 million years. However, that record\ncontains certain time intervals where major problems exist and certain\nunusual features whose precise nature has not yet been determined.\nCollateral studies of contemporaneous\nrock sequences exposed on land or\nobtained by coring at sea are needed to resolve these problems.\nBecause geomagnetic\npolarity transitions\nare the only frequent,\nglobally\nsynchronous\ngeophysical\nphenomena,\nhigh-precision\nmagnetostratigraphy\nis critically important to the correlation\nof ocean\nsediments\nand to the establishment\nof a temporal\nframework\nfor\nbiostratigraphic\nand isotopic events. An accurate magnetic polarity time\nscale is imperative for any attempt to place regional events in the context\nof global change. In addition, an accurate time scale is also a prerequisite\nto analyses of the statistics of the polarity intervals,\nwhich provide\ninformation directly relevant to dynamo modeling.\nAmong the topics that\nhave been studied and for which definitive answers do not yet exist are the\ndistribution\nof the lengths of polarity intervals as well as differences\nbetween normal and reversed intervals. Recently there has been considerably controversy\nabout the possibility of periodicities\nin the frequency of\nreversals--again\nwithout a definite resolution.\nWhile additional work on the time scale for the last 200 million years\nis still needed, perhaps the most important area for new research will be\nin determining the magnetic polarity time scale for time intervals prior to\nthe\n\npast 200\n\nmillion\n\nyears.\n\nBecause\n\nthere\n\nare no marine\n\nmagnetic\n\n142\n\nTHENATIONALGEOMAGNETIC\nINITIATIVE\n\nanomaliesndnodeep-sea\na\nmarine\nsediments thisage,thistaskwill be\nof\nparticularlydifficult.

However, these\nsame data provide valuable information about this conductivity distribution, particularly\nthat in the lowermost portion of the mantle, called the\nD" layer_\nUntil now, models of the conductivity\ndistribution\nhave\nassumed axisymmetry.\nHowever, there is strong evidence from seismology that the D" layer is nonsymmetric.\nAn important question is whether\nthe geomagnetic\ndata can discern this nonsymmetric\nconductivity\ndistribution.\nReliable determination\nof the temporal evolution of the magnetic\nfield at the core-mantle\nboundary provides a probe of the dynamics of\nfluid flow in the core (of obvious importance to dynamo theory) through\nthe determination\nof the pattern of fluid flow immediately beneath the core\nsurface in much the same way that surface plate motions constrain models\nof circulation\nin the mantle.\nMany important questions\nneed to be\nanswered.\nIs the flow nearly in geostrophic\nbalance, as in the atmosphere, or is the complicating\neffect of Lorentz forces important?\nIs the\ntop of the core stably stratified?\nWhat is the radial length scale of the\nflow?

Great progress has been made in the past few years\nin understanding\nthe transfer of angular momentum:\nthe budget of the\nEarth\'s total angular momentum is now well explained on time scales of\ndecades (meteorological\nstudies have led to a similar understanding\non\nseasonal\nto weekly time scales).\nBut, although the budget is well\nunderstood,\nthe mechanism is not, and the great challenge is to understand\nthe relative\n\nimportance\n\nof the various torques\n\n(pressure,\n\nelectromagnetic,\n\ngravitational,\nand viscous) that operate across the core-mantle boundary.\nThis issue is important not only in an understanding\nof the dynamics of\ncore-mantle\ncoupling; it also has implications for other fields, including\ndynamo theory and the interpretation\nof Earth nutation.\nThermal and\nchemical interactions play a central role in determining\nthe convective\nmotions throughout the Earth\'s interior and are a vital ingredient in the\nunderstanding\nof the thermal and chemical history of the Earth.\nThere are several questions\nregarding\nthe nature of a polarity\ntransition:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Is the Earth\'s magnetic field predominantly\ndipolar at the Earth\'s\nsurface during a transition?\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Are there preferred\ndirectional\nsystematics\npresent during a\ntransition?\n\xe2\x80\xa2 What is the temporal relationship between intensity changes and\ndirectional\n_lt7\n\nchanges?\n\n144\n\nTHE NATIONALGEOMAGNETIC\nINITIATIVE\n\xe2\x80\xa2 What similarities\ntransitions?\n\nand differences\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nIs the transitional field predominantly\nor quadrupole\n(symmetric) family?\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nAre there very rapid changes\na polarity transition?\n\nare there\n\nbetween\n\nsuccessive\n\nof the dipole (asymmetric)\n\nin direction\n\nand/or\n\nintensity\n\nduring\n\nFor many years, it was thought that westward drift was the dominant\nmode of behavior\nof the nondipole\nfield.\nRecent compilations\nof\nhistorical data suggest that individual centers of nondipole activity can\nmove and evolve in a variety of ways.\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nWhat processes\ngovern the behavior\nof the sources of the\nnondipole field?\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Are there persistent geographical\ncontrols on this behavior?\n\xe2\x80\xa2 What are the characteristic time constants in the secular-variation\nrecord?\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nIs there a change in secular variation\nfollowing a polarity transition?\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 What is the relationship\nsecular variation?\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nbetween\n\nimmediately\n\ngeomagnetic\n\nAre reversals distinct from normal secular\nrepresent an end member of a continuous\nvariation?\n\nRecently,\n\npaleomagnetic\n\nsecular-variation\n\npreceding\nexcursions\n\nvariation\nspectrum\n\nor\nand\n\nor do they\nin secular\n\ndata from lava flows have\n\nbeen used to provide valuable indirect information on the magnitudes of\nthe competing dynamo families (dipolar and quadrupolar).\nIs the ratio of\nthe strength of dipole to quadrupole family high during the Paleozoic long\nreverse interval as it appears to be during the Cretaceous long normal\ninterval?\nWhat do differences\nin the mean normal-polarity\nand\nreverse-polarity\ndata reflect?

If, in the future, continuous satellite\nsurvey data become available, the augmented observatory\ndata network\nwill still play a vital role in modeling.\nThis is because truly accurate\nmodels will be those which also model the ionospheric\nfield.\nSince\nsatellite data are acquired above the ionospheric currents, such fields are\na source of inaccuracy for field models based only on satellite data. The\ncombination\nof satellite data with a good distribution\nof surface data\npermits separation of the measured field according to its three constituent\nfields: the interior of the Earth, the ionosphere, and the magnetosphere.\nFor incorporation\nof a definitive model of the ionosphere into our\nmain field models, data from more than a single satellite are required.\nThis is because the morphology\nof the ionospheric fields varies in local\ntime, whereas the data from a satellite are acquired at only two local times\n(one ascending, the other descending).\nA reasonable attempt at such a\ndefinitive model could probably be carried out with three satellites in orbit\nsimultaneously\nand spaced equally in local time.\nThe network of observatories,\neven if augmented as described above,\ncan profitably be supplemented\nby true repeat stations.

These, in fact, are\ncrucial in any areas where the observatory data do not meet the requirements stated above. Such measurements\nwill never have the accuracy or\ncontinuity so valuable in observatory\ndata, but--in the absence of an\nobservatory--will\nrate.\n\nat least prevent\n\nthe models from being wildly inaccu-\n\nBecause of the importance of determining the temporal characteristics\nof the geomagnetic\nfield, there is great interest in studying past field\nchanges.\nThis can be done only for the few hundred years during which\nsome sort of magnetic data were acquired.\nRecent efforts to collect such\nhistorical data and use them in deriving spherical harmonic models have\n\nAPPENDIX\n\nA:\n\nTOPICAL\n\nWORKING\n\nGROUP\n\n149\n\nREPORTS\n\nproved very successful\nand useful.\nHowever,\nlarge portions of the\nhistorical data are not known or available to the modeling community.\nAn effort to gather\nhistorical models.\n\nLong-Period\nPaleomagnetic\nWith\naccessible\n\nsuch data is needed\n\nVariations:\nSyntheses\n\nmodern\n\nand\n\nare between\n\nThe\n\nhistorical\n60 and\n\nNeed\n\ndata,\n\nto increase\n\nthe accuracy\n\nof our\n\nfor\n\nArchaeomagnetic\n\nand\n\nthe\n\nlongest\n\n400 years.\n\nThese\n\ntemporal\nare\n\nscales\n\nnot the only\n\nimportant time scales for study of the geomagnetic field and the underlying dynamo.\nIn fact, it can be argued that longer-period\nvariations are\nmore important and fundamental.\nInformation about the longer-term\nsecular variation of the geomagnetic field can be obtained from the paleomagnetic\nstudy of archaeological\nmaterials,\nlava flows, rapidly deposited\nsediments,\nand cave deposits.\nOne clear advantage of using archaeological\nmaterials is that they can\noften by placed in a fairly restricted chronological\ncontext. The accuracy\nand resolution of that context is greatest for samples that are only a few\nhundred years old. Moreover,\nsamples of that age are an important\nmeans of supplementing\nthe historical\nrecord of field directions.\nIn\naddition, paleointensity\nstudies can provide the intensity information that\nis lacking from the historical observations.\nLava flows represent another source of information\nabout geomagnetic secular variation.\nThe advantage of lava flows is that they are\naccurate recorders of the geomagnetic\nfield direction at the time of the\neruption of the lava. In addition, using relatively well-established\nand\nwell-understood\nprocedures,\nit is possible to determine fairly accurately\nthe absolute intensity of the geomagnetic field at the time of the extrusion\nof a lava flow. However, here too, rock magnetic studies are needed to\nimprove the existing techniques.\nIn addition, the record of volcanic\nactivity in some fields extends over periods of several hundred thousand\nto a few million 2_ears.

Magnetic observatories\nare dedicated to recording\n\nlong-term (years) change in all three components of the magnetic field (as\nwell as shorter-term\nchanges on scales of hours and minutes).\nMagnetic\nobservatories\nare primarily distinguished\nfrom variation stations by the\nuse of independent absolute instruments at the observatories\nto accurately\ndetermine\nbaselines\nin order to establish\nlong-term\ntrends (secular\nvariation).\nData from magnetic observatories\nwill typically be 1-minute\nvalues or hourly mean values with a resolution\nof about 1 nanotesla\n(sometimes\n0.1 nanotesla).\nCurrently the data are sent to World Data\nCenters\n(WDCs);\nprior to this transmittal,\nthe data are usually not\navailable for 11A to 5 years, and sometimes not until 10 years. There are\nabout 180 observatories\nworldwide that send data in digital form to the\nWDCs.\nnetwork\n\nThey are mostly in the Northern\nHemisphere,\nwith a dense\nin Europe. There are very few in the Southern Hemisphere; with\n\nthe exception of a few island observatories,\nthere are none in the ocean\nareas.\nVariation stations record only variations in the vector components of\nthe Earth\'s magnetic field and do not attempt to determine baselines.\nAlthough some arrays of variation stations are operated on a semipermanent basis in Canada, Alaska, and northern Europe, most are operated on\na "campaign"\n\nbasis.\n\nVariation\n\nstations\n\nare used in studies\n\nof ULF and\n\nmagnetospheric\nor ionospheric\ncurrent systems and for induction and\nmagnetotelluric\nstudies of crustal and upper-mantle\nresistivity structure\n(such as in the EMSLAB project).\nRepeat stations are temporary magnetic observatories with "absolute"\ninstruments that are set up for a few days at repeat sites at intervals of 2\nto 10 years (usually 5 years). Data from these repeat stations are used to\naugment data from permanent observations and satellite surveys in making\nmagnetic charts and spherical harmonic models of the Earth\'s magnetic\nfield.\n\n158\n\nTHE NATIONAL\n\nCurrent\n\nStatus--Seafloor\n\nVector magnetic\n\nvariations\n\nGEOMAGNETIC\n\nINITIATIVE\n\nPlatforms\nhave been measured\n\non the ocean bottom\n\nwith amplitude resolution up to 0.1 nanotesla and time resolution up to\nabout 60 seconds.\nThe data are used in magnetotelluric\nand induction\nstudies of crustal and mantle resistivity.\nThe platforms\nhave been\noperated\nin "campaign"\nmodes for periods\nof weeks and months\n(EMSLAB,\nBarotropic\nElectromagnetic\nand Pressure\nExperiment\n(BEMPEX) and upcoming studies across passive margins and rift zones).\nNo permanent platforms have been established, and no absolute measurements have been made to establish\nsecular variation\nof the vector\ncomponents\nof the Earth\'s\nJapanese program.\nCurrent\n\nmagnetic\n\nfield,\n\nalthough\n\nthere\n\nis a nascent\n\nStatus--Instruments\n\nMore than half of the classical observatory\nmagnetometers\nof a few\ndecades ago have been replaced by digital, electronic magnetometers.\nThe electronic\nmagnetometers\nthemselves\nare also being improved.\nRecent developments\nhave resulted in the availability of high-resolution,\nvery stable, self-biasing,\nring core fluxgate vector magnetometers\nwith\ntypical characteristics:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 noise: 0.02 nanotesla/hertz\n@ 0.1 hertz;\n\xe2\x80\xa2 temperature drift: 0.1 nanotesla/\xc2\xb0C;\n\xe2\x80\xa2 baseline drift: 5 nanoteslas per year;\n\xe2\x80\xa2 power: 1-2 watts; and\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\noutput:\n\nanalog and digital.\n\nThese instruments can provide analog and digital data with resolution\nof better than 0.1 nanotesla and accuracy of 1 or 2 nanoteslas at 1.0second intervals.\nLower-power\nspecial applications.\neter,\n\ninstruments\n\nhave\n\nTotal field instruments such as the D.C. polarized\nthe Overhauser\nproton\nmagnetometer,\nand\n\nbeen developed\n\nfor\n\nproton magnetomoptically\npumped\n\nAPPENDIX\n\nB:\n\nOPERATIONAL\n\nWORKING\n\nGROUP\n\nREPORTS\n\n159\n\nmagnetometers\ncan provide absolute scalar data at sample intervals from\n0.1 second to 5 seconds with precision from 1.0 picotesla to 0.1 nanotesla\nand accuracy\nCurrent\n\nfrom 0.01 nanotesla\nStatus--Data\n\nto 1.0 nanotesla.\n\nCollection\n\nand Distribution\n\nThe reporting of results from magnetic observatories to World Data\nCenters is a major problem.\nIn a recent experiment to see how promptly\nannual means were sent to WDC-A, for example, it was learned that\nmany observatories\nINTERMAGNET\n\nwere 3 years late.\nUnder the newly established\nprogram,\ngeomagnetic\ndata\nfrom\nparticipating\n\ngeomagnetic observatories are transmitted in near real time via geostationary satellites or computer links to collection and distribution centers know\nas Geomagnetic\nInformation\nNodes (GINs).\nFour satellites are used\n(GOES-E, GOES-W, Geostationary\nMeteorological\nSatellite [GMS] and\nMeteorological\nSatellite [METEOSAT])\nwhich cover most of the globe\nfrom 70\xc2\xb0N to 70\xc2\xb0S latitude.

After merging on the front\nside, newly opened field lines are transported\nby the solar wind to the\nnightside, and temporarily\nstored in the tail. About an hour later they\nreconnect forming closed field lines.\nThis process allows the tail-like\nfield lines to collapse earthward accelerating\nparticles\ninto the inner\nmagnetosphere\nwhere either they precipitate into the atmosphere causing\naurora or they are injected into the Van Allen radiation belts enhancing\nthe ring current.\nThis sequence of events--corresponding\nto a complete\ncircuit through this global convection system--is called a magnetospheric\nsubstorm.\nA magnetic storm is produced when a number of substorms\noccur in rapid succession, building up an intense ring current.\nSeparation of charges in the moving magnetospheric\nplasma creates\nelectric\nfields that are projected\nonto the ionosphere\nalong highly\nconducting\nfield lines.\nThese fields drive electrical currents in the\nionosphere\nwhich--in\nregions of electric field in conductivity\ngradients-couple\nto the magnetosphere\nthrough field-aligned currents.

Interagency cooperation would\nensure the optimal applications of these operational environmental\nsatellites to provide routine monitoring of main field and secularvariation field, in addition to ionospheric fields, during both solar\nquiet and disturbed times.

Significant Upgrade to DMSP/POGS\nand NOAA Polar.\nOn\neach satellite, Magsat-quality or better is desired for DMSP Block\n6 and 7, and NOAA\'s\n\nnext-generation\n\npolar\n\nsatellites.\n\nIt is\n\nAPPENDIX\n\nB:\n\nOPERATIONAL\n\nWORKING\n\nGROUP\n\n187\n\nREPORTS\n\nnecessary to have both vector and scalar instruments\non these\nsatellites to intercalibrate.\nAttitude accuracy is necessary.\n1\n\nMagnetospheric\nMagnetic\nField Missions.\nThe mapping of\ngeomagnetic\nfield lines from the Earth\'s surface to the outer\nregions of the magnetosphere\nis not adequate to accurately\ntransfer magnetic disturbance vectors from the magnetosphere\nto\nthe ionosphere.\nTo solve this problem, a survey of the magnetic\nfield between low-Earth orbit and magnetospheric\naltitudes is\nneeded.\nThese missions also provide the activity state of the\nmagnetosphere\n\nas well as a measure\n\nof external\n\nfields.\n\nConclusions\nThe tradition of magnetic field measurements\nfrom the original\nscientific recordings in the 1600s by Sir William Gilbert has continuously\nimproved and progressed.\nThe progression from solely ground observatory data to combinations\nwith satellite observations\nculminated\nin the\nNASA Magsat mission of 1979-1980, resulting in the extremely accurate\nIGRF-80\nmagnetic field model.\nWith the termination\nof the Magsat\nmission, this progression\nis in an apparent hiatus.\nAs a result, the\nfollowing goals and recommendations\nare set forth, giving the measurement of core and crustal fields first priority.\nThis is evidenced in the\ngoals as well as in the support of the ARISTOTELES\nmission.\nThe list of missions given above has been prioritized in two separate\nways that will successfully\nmeet the scientific goals set forth by the\nproposed initiative. The first proposed mission has been limited to urgent\nneeds, presently available missions, and missions of opportunity.\nThe\nlatter two reflect common interests in magnetic field measurements\nbridging the various scientific and pragmatic disciplines and concerns.\nEfforts must be made to avoid possible duplication\namong agency\nprograms.\nparticular\nforms.\n\nA synergistic\ninteragency\neffort is a clear approach,\nin\nwith regard to the DOD and NOAA operational\npolar plat-\n\n188\n\nTHE NATIONAL\n\nGEOMAGNETIC\n\nINITIATIVE\n\nFinally, the long-term recommendations\nrepresent the continuance\nof high-quality magnetic field measurements\nsatisfying the needs of all of\nthe disciplines\ninvolved and the maintenance\nof the tradition of these\nimportant data. All considerations\nfor satellite monitoring of the main\nfield thus far have centered on continuous monitoring with Magsat-quality\ndata. That means vector data with 10 to 20 arc second, or better than 5nanotesla accuracy,\ntogether with absolute scalar data with 1- to 2nanotesla accuracy.\nThe scalar data are used to calibrate the vector data\nin-flight.\n\nSuch are the ideal measurements.\n\nIn practice,\n\nhowever,\n\nthere\n\nare two ways to compromise\nthese measurements\nand still acquire very\nuseful data. The first compromise\nis to monitor the field only at periodic\nintervals, say at 10-year intervals, rather than continuously.\nIn order for\nsuch a compromise\nto provide data for a really adequate study of longterm core and mantle phenomena, expansion of the surface observatory\nnetwork as described in a previous section is required.\nA second compromise\nis to acquire\nless accurate,\nhence less\nexpensive, data. The least expensive route is to acquire data only from\na fluxgate magnetometer.\nIn the case where little or no attitude information is acquired, the data will be analyzed as field magnitude data only.\nSuch are the data from the currently active POGS spacecraft of the U.S.\nNavy.\nIn the case where attitude information\nof a few arc minutes is\navailable, the vector data are very useful in mapping fields from fieldaligned currents and ionospheric\ncurrents, though not for main field\nmodeling.\nSuch are the data from the DE-2 spacecraft which operated\nfrom late 1991 through 1992, and such are the data planned for the DMSP\nBlock 5 series. The major difficulty with such data is the lack of absolute\nmeasurement.\nWhile low-drift-rate\nfluxgate instruments\nare indeed\navailable, all are subject to some drift. On a spacecraft, such instruments\nare subjected\nto extremes\nin vibration,\nradiation,\nand temperature\nchanges;\nit is impossible to know what drifts, if any, have occurred.\nNevertheless,\nthe DE-2 data were successfully used in one of the better\ncandidate models used in the most recent update of the IGRF. However,\nthree of those who submitted candidate models chose not to use these\ndata.\n\nAPPENDIX OPERATIONAL\nB:\nWORKING\nGROUP\nREPORTS\n\n189\n\nAnothercompromise\nwould be to fly only an absolutescalar\nmagnetometer no attitudedetermination. his is moreexpensive\nwith\nT\nthan flying only a fluxgate,because instrumentcost is greater.\nthe\nHowever,hemeasurements\nt\narenotsubjecto drift andhence\nt\narebetter\nfor mainfieldmodeling.A majorshortcoming thatthemeasurements\nis\ncan makeno contribution the studyof fieldsfrom field-aligned\nto\nor\nionosphericurrents.\nc\n\nB2.\n\nDATA\n\nMANAGEMENT\n\nNew Directions\n\nSYSTEMS\n\nand New Needs\n\nManagement of data in the future will be a greater challenge for what\nhave been previously\ntermed "data centers."\nNew developments\nin\ntechnology and new demands by the scientific community,\nas expressed\nby the working group reports in this document, for improved services will\ntax the resources and ingenuity of these organizations.\nWith the advent\nof distributed computing systems, data centers will not only be repositories of archived data physically residing in such centers, but even more\nimportantly\nthey will become the information\nand management\nvehicle\nthat will enable scientists in all disciplines to locate the data they need\nmore easily and efficiently.\nThis is especially important for the needed\ninterdisciplinary\nstudies that will require a relational data base of such\nfiles.\nSuch a data base will require a significantly\nincreased level of\ncoordination\nand cooperation among the centers.\nThe new demands for access will require modern and efficient\napproaches\nacquired.\n\nto accommodate the increasing volume and complexity of data\nWith this new confederacy in information\nmanagement,\nthe\n\ncenters cannot easily mandate standard formats, but they can help guide\nthe many remote cells in use of data formats and access software\nindependent of the platforms being used.\n\nAppendix B2 was largely developed by the following workshop group: Joe\nAllen and Herbert Meyers (Group Leaders), R.

Some scientists are concerned with the intense magnetic fields of\nsunspots and other solar features.\nFortunately,\nthese can be observed\nremotely from Earth, and there are fascinating data that suggest that the\nmaximum magnetic fields of solar active regions have been systematically\nand monotonically\nincreasing in intensity over at least the past three solar\ncycles.\nAt the same time, the well-known\ndecline in intensity of the\ninternal\ndipole moment\nis reducing\nthe volume\nand size of the\nmagnetosphere\nthat shields against (or organizes) the influx of energetic\ncharged particles from the galaxy and from the Sun. The frequency and\nintensity of magnetic storms are also increasing with time.\nAre these\nchanges interrelated?\nIf so, what is the prospect for the future?\nSome workers will be concerned with the heliospheric magnetic field\nthat spreads in waving folds through interplanetary\nspace and sweeps\naround with the rotating Sun. Others will be mainly interested in changes\nof magnetic\nfields sensed by geostationary\nsatellites just inside the\nmagnetopause\nor at lower altitudes by polar-orbiting\nspacecraft.\nMany\nwill be concerned with magnetic field measurements\nin space at lower\naltitudes by more satellites so that spatial patterns of geomagnetic\nfield\nvariation may be identified as arising from currents in space, from nearsurface sources, or deep in the Earth\'s interior.\nSome will be interested\nin the long-term global field and its slow, almost geological, time scales\nof change; others in the rapid, local variations or globally organized\npatterns of external currents that cause rapid change at one or a few sites\nor that produce significant changes over large regions of Earth.\nFinally, there will be the spacecraft operators and electric power\nsystem operators or makers of sensitive microelectronics\nfor whom large,\nrapid changes in the geomagnetic field are a potential source of disaster\nbecause of their effects on sensitive technology.\nAll of these groups will\nhave a common need for access to high-quality geomagnetic data collected\nwith accurate instruments\nat key locations, processed\nto comparable\n\n192\n\nTHE NATIONAL\n\nstandards\n\nGEOMAGNETIC\n\nover time and space, and reduced to products\n\nand assumptions\n\nINITIATWE\n\nwhose definitions\n\nare well known and understood.\n\nData Bases\nOf initial concern is the need to identify the sources of geomagnetic\ndata. What data are collected, by which groups, and at what sites? Are\ndata collected in the past adequate in type, quality, and coverage (spatial\nand temporal); adequately documented to support the conclusions already\ndrawn from them; and adequately documented for them to be combined\nwith newer data to support present and future research?\nThose same\nquestions can be asked of geomagnetic data being collected today, and for\ndata that will be taken in the future either by temporary,\nlimited campaigns or by worldwide monitoring arrays. Also, as technology changes\nand costs of maintaining old methods of data collection rise beyond the\nability of sponsoring\ngroups to continue supporting\nthem, how can\npriorities be set for what should be continued and what terminated?\n\nData\n\nArchives\n\nThe transition in philosophy of data center function--from\nmanagement of all data at data centers to distribution of many of the data--brings\nforward many issues. Well-organized\nand funded projects that make data\navailable\nneed only keep the centers\ninformed of their directories.\nMoreover, as such projects mature, and especially after the data coIlection\nperiod is completed, the centers must take a more active role. In the\nimplementation\nof a project,\ndocumentation\nof data is frequently\nneglected.\nMoreover, as a project matures and participants leave, it often\nhappens that this neglect of documentation\nis never corrected.\nHow can\ndata centers maintain an active role throughout\nsuch a project, keep\nabreast of the activities that generate data, coordinate documentation,\nand\narrange transfer to an archive? How can centers be made aware that some\n\nAPPENDIX\n\nB:\n\nOPERATIONAL\n\nWORKING\n\nGROUP\n\n193\n\nREPORTS\n\ndata may be at risk of loss to future research and be encouraged to take\na hand in their preservation?\nNot all data collection efforts are well integrated and organized,\nespecially of internationally\nproduced data. In such instances, the centers\nneed to maintain their traditional role of negotiating\nstandardization\nof\nformats and assisting, as possible, to achieve adequate archiving capability\nof the data produced.\nSuch efforts relate both to primary observations\n(such as geomagnetic\ndata collected from fixed stations) and to indices\nderived from such observations.\nWith limited resources, a balance of\neffort is needed between centralized and distributed components.\n\nData Access\nData access concepts are of special concern because many data sets\nexist that cannot be reached by all who need to use them.\nLimited\naccessibility\n\nfor a particular\n\ndata base may not be a result of a deliberately\n\nimplemented\npolicy decision, but may result from the fact that plans for\ncollecting the data did not include data processing\nand availability\nas\nimportant\ngoals.\nLimited accessibility\nmay be a consequence\nof the\nphysical characteristics\nof the media containing the data (for example,\nanalog magnetograms\non paper or strip charts held as rolls stored in a\ncloset).\nFilm media (35mm microfilm or microfiche) for many years\nwere a convenient way to capture vast amounts of geomagnetic data and\npreserve them compactly at an archive so that they could be retrieved and\ninexpensively copied upon request. However, the requirement for digital\ndata for computer analysis that characterizes\nresearch today relegates film\nrecords to a secondary role.\nOnce geomagnetic data are in digital form, how are they to be stored\nand transferred from one site to another? Are tapes with inherent serial\naccess problems\nstill a viable answer?\nHas the 8-mm helical scan\nvideotape\ncassette with its vast capacity become the new medium of\nchoice? What are the relative merits and problems with optical media?\nWhat\n\nwill technology\n\noptical tape)?\n\n: ==\n\nprovide\n\nHow long-lived\n\nnext (for example,\nare the various\n\ndigital\n\naudio\n\nchoices, how universal\n\ntape,\nare\n\n194\n\nTHE NATIONAL\n\nGEOMAGNETIC\n\nINITIATIVE\n\nthe recording and playback devices, and how robust but inexpensive are\nthe media? These are key questions.\nAlso, how many users today prefer\non-line data bases for real-time or retrospective\naccess, and what type of\nanalysis does on-line access support? How can images and data plots be\nmade accessible\non-line together with digital data?\nThe ubiquitous\npersonal\ncomputer\nhas revolutionized\nthe collection,\nprocessing,\nexchange, and analysis over the past decade. Now, globally interconnected workstations\nare clearly the wave of the next decade.\nAs data are\nmade more accessible\nthrough the net or on various media, access,\ndisplay, and manipulation\nsoftware are essential for efficient utilization.\nThis places a premium\n\non having platform-independent\n\ndata systems.\n\nData Products\nMuch of the driving force that justifies national and international\nsupport for programs to collect geomagnetic data comes from a demand\nfor derived data products such as maps, models, or magnetic activity\nindices. Some models and charts are primarily used for navigation while\nothers describe the main field. External fields in the magnetosphere\nand\nionosphere are interesting scientifically but must be removed to study or\nto chart the main field. Models of the crustal field and maps of magnetic\nanomalies have geological importance but can be contaminated\nby natural\nfluctuations of external fields. When the complication\nof secular change\nis added, it becomes challenging to create accurate models and charts with\ndata that are less than ideal. In addition, changing user needs require\nhigher time resolution and data from locations not previously monitored.\nDevelopments\nin technology have revolutionized\nthe ability to collect and\nanalyze data.\nUnderstanding\nsolar wind and the geomagnetic\n\nof the physical processes that couple the\nfield has progressed to the point that solar\n\nwind data are critical for driving magnetospheric\nmodels and making\naccurate forecasts of impending activity.\nThese advances have created\nopportunities\nfor significant improvements\nin data products.\n\nAPPENDIX\n\nB:\n\nOPERATIONAL\n\nComponents\nData\n\nWORKING\n\nGROUP\n\nREPORTS\n\n195\n\nof Data Management\n\nBases\n\nData are the most fundamental\ncal endeavors.\nHowever, transfer\n\nand essential component of geophysiof data to a data base is frequently a\n\nlow-priority\nconcern of scientists once the data have served the intended\npurposes for a particular research project or objective.\nOften a research\nproject will collect a large amount of data, use only a small portion of it\nfor the intended purpose, and then disregard or dispose of the entire data\nset. Until recently, few research programs have taken the necessary steps\nto document their data sets by providing accounts of such factors as the\ntype of data being collected, technical specifications\nof the instruments\nthat were used, the temporal and spatial resolutions of the observations,\nor even how the data are being stored, and few research programs have\nseen to it that the data are archived at some publicly accessible archival\ncenter. Data base management\nis an often neglected aspect of many (if\nnot most) research programs,\ndespite the fact that data constitute the\nevidentiary pillar upon which science itself rests.\nFurthermore,\nit seems clear that most scientists are aware of only a\nfraction of the data bases that have been, are being, or will be collected,\neven within the limited field of geomagnetism.\nThis represents a loss in\nat least two ways: first, because data may already exist (or be on the way)\nthat could serve the needs of other research objectives;\nand second,\nbecause the mere knowledge of an existing (or developing) data base can\nserve the serendipitous\nfunction of generating new research ideas and\npromote interdisciplinary\ncooperation between research groups. Because\nof the vast proliferation\nof data sets from land, air, sea, and satellite\nprograms,\nit is not (currently) possible for anyone to keep track of all the\ndata bases being accumulated in the diverse disciplines within geomagnetism.\nThus, two operational requirements\nfor geomagnetic data bases are\nas follows:\n\n196\n\nTHE NATIONAL\n\nGEOMAGNETIC\n\nINITIATIVE\n\n1. to identify the sources of geomagnetic data from land, air, sea,\nand satellite that have been, are being, or will be collected from\nongoing or temporary observational\ncampaigns; and\n2. to address the issues relating to the formatting, storing, documenting, and archiving of data bases.\nThe following few acronyms (spelled out in Appendix\n3 of this\nvolume) represent a small sample of the variety of projects that involve\ngeomagnetic\ndata bases.\n\nEMSLAB\nSYNOP\nSAMNET\nISTP/GGS\n\n!\n\nPOGS\n\nOEDIPUS-A\n\n] IEEY\n\nMAGIC\nGOES\nULYSSES\n\nINTERMAGNET\nAWAGS\nCRRES\n\nCANOPUS\n] WIND\nSTEP\n\nAlthough many of these acronyms are well known, it is unlikely that\nanyone is knowledgeable\nabout all of these programs.\nIt is even less\nlikely they know the\nresolution,\nsampling\nprincipal investigator,\ncampaigns, there are\nmore familiar to the\nobservatory\nnetwork,\n\ntype of magnetic data being recorded, the spatial\nrates, instrument\nsensitivity,\nstatus of the data,\nor how to obtain the data. In addition to temporary\nmany ongoing geomagnetic data bases that may be\nresearch community,\nsuch as the USGS magnetic\nthe NGDC worldwide digital data collection, and\n\nthe magnetic models produced by the USGS, U.S. Naval Oceanographic\nOffice (NAVOCEANO),\nNASA, and IZMIRAN\n(Russian\nInstitute\nTerrestrial Magnetism).\nClearly, there is a need to identify, catalog, specify (document),\nand\nmake known the many diverse projects\nand programs\nthat involve\ngeomagnetic\ndata bases. Perhaps an organization such as the American\nGeophysical Union (AGU) could provide the forum wherein the (largely)\ninformational\nrequirement\ncould be fulfilled. Researchers could provide\nthe relevant details to AGU, which could, in turn, publish this information\nperiodically\nin their transactions (EOS). It would be the responsibility\nof\nevery research\nprogram\nto notify AGU of its activities\nrelated to\n\nAPPENDIX\n\nB:\n\nOPERATIONAL\n\nWORKING\n\nGROUP\n\nREPORTS\n\n197\n\ngeomagnetic\n(or other) data bases for the benefit and elucidation\nof\neveryone in the community.\nIt is not enough, however, that the scientific community be informed\nof existing and prospective\ndata bases in geomagnetism.\nIt is also\nimperative that these data be transferred to standardized formats, on stable\nmedia such as CD-ROMs or Magneto-Optical\n(MO) drives, and be made\nreadily accessible to potential users.\nThere are almost as many formats for data bases as there are projects\nacquiring them. Often the choice of formats is arbitrary and determined\nby the existing data-processing\nsoftware at the organization\nis gathering\nthe data. This need not be the case, however, and uniform data formats\ncould be established that would greatly facilitate the ready compatibility\nof data bases to everyone\'s data-processing\ncapabilities.\nFormats could\nbe developed for 1-second, 5-second, 10-second, 1-minute, 1-hour, and\nso on, temporal resolutions; the magnetic field values themselves could\nbe stored in standardized\nformats for vector or scalar data, in variation\n(voltage) or field (magnetic) units, with a variety of degrees of resolution\n(1 nanotesla, 0.1 nanotesla, 0.05 nanotesla, and so on). Even much of the\ndocumentation\nof data bases could be included in the header portion of the\ndata records, which would ensure that those unfamiliar with the data set\nwould have the best opportunity to be well informed of the nature of the\ndata and any issues relating to their quality. This is certainly not an easy\nmatter to resolve, but the effort needs to be made to standardize\nthe\nformats of geomagnetic data as much as possible in order to minimize the\nneed for multiple data access software programs, minimize the potential\nfor error in retrieving these data, and maximize the availability and ease\nof use.\nIn addition to formats, there is also a need to standardize data base\nstorage media and take advantage of advancements\nin technology\nthat\noffer small, high-volume,\nhigh-density,\nlow-cost, and easy-to-use data\nstorage devices that ensure the preservation\nof data bases for decades to\ncome. As was recommended\nin the NAS/NRC report, Geophysical Data:\nPolicy Issues, the scientific community\nitself should be aware of the\nproblems\nand take steps to ensure the preservation\nand integrity of\ncollected data.

Overall stewardship of the geomagnetic archive needs to reside at\na single center even though there are many remote nodes performing\nmany of the processing, distribution,\nand analysis functions.\nThe National Geophysical Data Center and its collocated World Data\nCenter-A in Boulder, Colorado, are the archive centers for U.S. national\ngeomagnetic\ndata and for geomagnetic\ndata relating to national and\ninternational\nprograms,\nrespectively.\nAll data-collecting\nagencies,\nfunding agencies, and research programs should coordinate with NGDC\nand WDC-A at the beginning stages of new data campaigns and research\nprograms\nto assure that adequate provisions\nand resources\nwill be\navailable for data management activities.\n\nData Access\nThis section\nproviding\ndiscussion\n\nconsiders\n\nsome of the technical\n\nissues involved\n\nwith\n\nscientific access to magnetic field observations.\nFor this\nit is assumed that the data are available in digital form.

Indices in common use include the K-index family,\nDst, and AE. The K index has served the geophysics community well for\n60 years, but a simple range index defined over 3-hour intervals\nlonger computationally\nnecessary or adequate.\nNew descriptors\nmeasure the amplitude and rate of change of magnetic fluctuations\n\nis no\nthat\nover\n\na range of time scales are needed. Modern data collection platforms allow\nspectral analysis in near real time. Data sampled at 1-second resolution\ncould be analyzed in place, and the power in specified frequency bands\nindexed and transmitted over satellite links.\nThe Dst and AE indices are based on separate networks of observatories and meet the need for global activity indices.\nHowever, because\nsome of the stations do not deliver digital data, it takes years to construct\nthe indices, which are presently issued at 1-minute to 1-hour resolutions.\nIn addition, deficiencies in the spatial distribution\nof the observatories\nused to derive the Dst and AE indices have been identified.\nThe first\nthree recommendations\nare these: (1) a new family of indices based on\nmagnetic power spectra at local observatories should be developed; (2) the\nsuite of AE indices should be computed at 1-minute resolution from an\nimproved spatial distribution\nof digital stations; and (3) Dst should be\ncomputed at 1-minute resolution from an improved distribution of digital\nstations with improved correction for quiet diurnal variations.\nFor operational\nuse, indices should be available (as nearly as\npossible) in real time. Accurate forecasts are possible if solar wind data\nfrom the forward Lagrangian position (L-l) are used. In addition, solar\nwind parameters\nprovide the boundary conditions necessary\nto drive\n\n204\n\nTHE NATIONALGEOMAGNETIC\nINITIATIVE\n\nmagnetospheric\nandionospheric odels.

The\nsecond\ncategory,\nmodels\nof externally\ncaused\nfields,\nincludes\nmagnetospheric\nand ionospheric\nmodels.\nThe third category includes\nmodels of the crustal field, maps of magnetic anomalies, and data sets\nconsisting of grid values derived from anomaly maps. These three kinds\nof products and associated requirements\nare described below.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Main Field and Navigation\n(Global and National).\nThese\nproducts provide the vital information on the variation of the compass that\nis so essential for safe navigation of aircraft, ships, and boats. They also\nprovide information on the strength of the main field needed by exploration geophysicists for enhancing magnetic survey measurements taken in\nthe search for petroleum and minerals, and information on the change of\ndeclination\noften needed by land surveyors.\nCurrently, NASA,\nNAVOCEANO,\nand USGS produce global geomagnetic models. These\nagencies, along with the British Geological Survey (BGS) and IZMIRAN,\nparticipated in the recent (1991) revision of the IGRF. World charts for\n1990, based on NAVOCEANO and BGS models, and aimed at satisfying\nDOD requirements, have been issued by the Defense Mapping Agency\n(DMA).\nThe USGS will issue world charts for 1990, based on the IGRF\nand aimed at satisfying the needs of science and commerce.\nThe USGS\n\nAPPENDIX\n\nB:\n\nOPERATIONAL\n\nWORKING\n\nGROUP\n\nREPORTS\n\n205\n\nhas produced national models for the United States for 1990 and will issue\nassociated charts of D and F. The USGS also provides a dial-in service\nfor obtaining model field elements via terminal and modem.\nThe main challenge faced by workers in this field is how to create\naccurate models and charts with data that are often less than ideal. Other\nchallenges\ninclude improving forecasts of secular variation;\nproviding\nbetter access to models, model information, and associated software; and\ncoping with reduced funding. Good models and charts require good data.\nNeeded are frequent global surveys, like the Magsat satellite survey of\n1979-1980,\nand a well-distributed\nnetwork of magnetic observatories.\nSecular-variation\nforecasts, currently based on empirical analysis, would\nimprove if a workable theory of main field generation were available.\nThe increasing need for greater accessibility to models, model values, and\nassociated\nsoftware could be met by greater exploitation\nof modern\ntechnology,\nincluding network communications.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 External\nField Models.\nModels of the externally\nthe geomagnetic field are useful for correcting\nand for basic research on the magnetosphere.\n\ncaused part of\n\nground-based\nobservations\nMore accurate, dynamic\n\nrepresentations\nof all of the components\nof the magnetosphere\nand\nionosphere\n(including\nsolar quiet, the auroral\nelectrojet,\nand the\nfield-aligned currents) are needed.

The needs of these agencies vary greatly, from purely\nscientific to operational needs, and there is also much overlap among their\nneeds.\nThus, it seems obvious that there should be a great deal of\ncommunication\nbetween the various government agencies, first to define\ntheir needs and to discover the areas of overlap, and second to prepare\nand carry out joint data collection or analysis programs.\nIn some cases this communication\nhas occurred and joint programs\nhave been conducted.\nIn other cases there has been little communication\nand the advantage of joint programs has not yet been realized by the\nrelevant agencies.\nIt is the objective of this report to describe the main\nmissions of the government\nagencies in the field of geomagnetism.\nVarious areas of possible communication\nand collaboration\nwill be\nsuggested.\n\nNational\n\nAeronautics\n\nand\n\nSpace\n\nAdministration\n\n(NASA)\n\nNASA has taken the primary initiative for satellite programs\nto\nmeasure the geomagnetic field. The most recent satellite to have done this\nwas Magsat,\n12 years ago.\nDespite considerable\nefforts during the\nintervening time, no subsequent geomagnetic\nsatellite mission has been\ncarried out. One current possibility is to collaborate with the European\nSpace\nAgency\n(ESA)\nto launch\nARISTOTELES\nby mid-1998.\n\nAppendix B3 was largely developed by the workshop participants and was\ncoordinated by Christopher Harrison (Group Leader).\n2O8\n\nAPPENDIX\n\nB:\n\nOPERATIONAL\n\nARISTOTELES\n\nWORKING\n\nis a joint magnetic\n\nGROUP\n\nREPORTS\n\n209\n\nfield and gravity mission with a low-\n\nelevation phase to measure the crustal field and a high-elevation\nphase to\nmeasure the time-varying core field. The availability of gravity data from\nthis mission would materially help the interpretation\nof upper-lithosphere\nmagnetic anomalies.\nIf the necessary collaboration\nwith ESA cannot be\narranged, the next best alternative would be for NASA to collaborate with\nthe French and Italian space agencies to accomplish a similar mission.\nAnother possibility is to collaborate with the French space agency to\ncarry out the high-altitude\nMagnetic Field Explorer Magnolia mission.\nNASA also has a responsibility\nfor scientific aircraft flights, and there is\na possibility of carrying out magnetic field observations\nfor aircraft in the\nfuture, under NASA\'s auspices.\nShould there be a negative decision on\nARISTOTELES\nby ESA, NASA will consider one of these missions, or\nan alternative inexpensive magnetic field mission.\nThe measurement\nof magnetic fields from satellites is driven by basic\nscientific needs; NASA has developed a competent\ngroup of scientists\nengaged in the study of the magnetic\nmodelers to crustal anomaly experts.\n\nfield of the Earth, from core field\nMajor advances have been made in\n\nthe ability to analyze noisy satellite data, to produce the most accurate\nmagnetic\nfield model possible.\nSpherical\nharmonic\nmodels of the\ngeomagnetic\nfield produced by NASA are major contributors\nto the\nInternational\nGeomagnetic\nReference Field.\nNASA also supports a very strong program of research in the areas\nof magnetospheric\nand ionospheric physics. Major new science missions\nare under development\nunder the International\nSolar Terrestrial\nPhysics\nand the Thermosphere-Ionosphere-Mesosphere\nEnergetics and Dynamics\n(TIMED) programs.\nSmaller missions are also actively under development under the aegis of the Small Explorer\n(SMEX) program.\nA\nvigorous\nprogram\nof rocket and balloon flights directed at upperatmosphere and ionospheric phenomena is also maintained.\nIn addition,\nNASA supports a broad program of theory, data analysis, and modeling\nresearch in these fields.\nAdvances have been made in the ability to deal with ionospheric and\nmagnetospheric\nthe core field.\nm\n\nfields and to deal with the temporally varying portion of\nThe availability of a superior magnetic field model for\n\n210\n\nTHE NATIONAL\n\n1980, mainly generated\n\nby Magsat\n\nGEOMAGNETIC\n\ndata, has rejuvenated\n\nINITIATIVE\n\nthe study of the\n\nmagnetic properties of the core and of the core-surface\nmotions thought\nto be responsible for the secular variation of the Earth\'s magnetic field.\nInterest in the crustal component of the field has encouraged study of the\nrock magnetic properties of candidate rock types thought to be responsible\nfor the long-wavelength\nmagnetic anomalies recorded at satellite altitude.\n\nU.S.\n\nGeological\n\nSurvey\n\nThe USGS is part of the U.S. Department\n\n(USGS)\nof the Interior.\n\nOne of the\n\nmajor tasks of the USGS in the field of geomagnetism\nis to operate the\ngeomagnetic\nobservatories within the United States and its territories.\nAt\nthe moment, there are 13 observatories\nin operation.\nThe USGS has been\na major force in the creation of INTERMAGNET,\nan international\nprogram to set up state-of-the-art\ngeomagnetic\nobservatories\nwith the\nability to transmit digital data in real time to the data centers. CD-ROMs\nof 1-minute observatory\ndata are available from USGS.\nGeomagnetic\nobservatories\nproduce important data sets for the generation of geomagnetic reference fields, and USGS has a task to produce such models,\nwhich are candidate\nmodels for the IGRF.\nThe INTERMAGNET\nprogram will eventually expand to about 70 observatories.\nThe USGS also produces geomagnetic charts of the United States and\nthe world every 5 years. There is also a service to provide model values\nof the geomagnetic\nelements by means of an on-line, dial-in service.\nBecause of the major role that USGS\ncrustal geology of the United States, there is\ncollection and analysis of crustal geomagnetic\nand over areas of the exclusive economic\nlow-altitude\nearthquake,\nmissions.\n\nplays in understanding\nthe\nconsiderable emphasis on the\nfield anomalies both on land\nzone.\nThe USGS conducts\n\naeromagnetic\nstudies for mineral and energy assessment,\nand volcanic hazard studies, and a variety of other USGS\nPaleomagnetic\nand rock magnetic\nlaboratories\nconduct\n\ngeological and tectonic\nof magnetic anomalies.\nNavy have responsibilities\n\ninvestigations and participate in the interpretation\nDespite the fact that USGS, NOAA, and the U.S.\nfor the collection\n\nof geomagnetic\n\nfield anomaly\n\nAPPENDIX\n\nB:\n\nOPERATIONAL\n\nWORKING\n\nGROUP\n\n211\n\nREPORTS\n\ndata, there is little formal communication\namong these agencies.\nThere\nis, however, much informal communication.\nBecause of the need to\nremove the diurnal variation of the magnetic\naccurate value of the internal field, some\n\nfield from surveys to give an\neffort is spent by USGS to\n\nproduce more accurate and predictive models for the Sq variation.\nUSGS\ninterest in crustal magnetic field anomalies resulted in cosponsorship\nof\nMagsat with NASA. There is still interest in USGS in obtaining a more\ndetailed crustal anomaly data base by flying a satellite in a lower orbit\nthan Magsat.\nThe USGS can support and coordinate multiagency\nacquisition of\nnew aeromagnetic\ndata in the United\nStates by use of improved\ndata-merging\ntechniques and by use of USGS geophysical aircraft. These\naircraft can fly long baselines to tie more localized surveys together and\ncan also perform low-altitude\nsurveys in areas related to missions of\nUSGS and other federal agencies.\nFunding for the acquisition of a second-generation\nnational magnetic\nmap by USGS is problematic\nat this time because of severe budgetary\nlimitations and because of the broad scope of this type of project.\nThis\neffort will require participation\nfrom a wide base of the geomagnetic\ncommunity,\ncoordinated\nby USGS, but involving the support, cooperation, and participation\nof other federal agencies, state governments,\nindustry, and academia.\nThe USGS also carries out MT and MV studies for resource\nassessment.\n\nThis work\n\nis funded\n\nin part\n\nby DOE\n\nbecause\n\nof the\n\ngeothermal\nresource implications of the research, and by EPA.\nSome\nwork is done by USGS to calculate upper- and lower-mantle conductivity\nby using observatory data.\nThe USGS does not fund a great deal of work extramurally\nin\ngeomagnetism,\npartly because of budgetary cutbacks in recent years.\nThere is considerable\ninformal collaboration\nwith university scientists.\nSome forms of collaboration,\nsuch as the employment\nof students, is\nsometimes made difficult by bureaucratic problems.\nThis is certainly an\narea where practices could be improved,\nto the university community.\n\nwith benefits both to USGS and\n\n212\n\nTHE NATIONALGEOMAGNETIC\nINITIAT1VI_\n\nNational\n\nOceanic\n\nand Atmospheric\n(NOAA)\n\nAdministration\n\nNOAA is part of the U.S. Department of Commerce.\nIt currently\noperates two series of environmental\nsatellites in geostationary\nand lowpolar orbit.\nOne important NOAA mission is to monitor geomagnetic\nfield activity.\nJointly with the Air Force Air Weather Service, NOAA\noperates the Space Environment\nServices Center, which is staffed 24\nhours a day. SESC monitors the level of activity of the Earth\'s magnetic\nfield and informs other government agencies, educational institutions, and\nindustrial centers when the amplitude of fluctuations\nexceeds a preset\nthreshold.\nHigh magnetic activity sometimes\ncauses disruption\nof\nimportant systems, such as power grids and communication\nnetworks.\nSome of the data used in this monitoring\nactivity comes from NOAAmanaged magnetometers\nof the Geostationary\nOperational Environmental\nSatellites (GOES).\nNOAA also issues predictions\nof geomagnetic\nactivity for similar\nuses. Because the variations of the magnetic field which are of importance in these predictions and warnings are often caused by solar activity,\nNOAA scientists also conduct research in solar-terrestrial\nrelationships.\nNOAA\'s weather satellites sometimes malfunction\ndue to magnetic\nstorms; thus, a greater knowledge of these phenomena\nis important for\nthis agency.\nNOAA also has a responsibility\nfor the production of nautical charts\nof coastal areas, and requires magnetic field information to indicate the\nmagnetic variation (declination) and its change on these charts. The U.S.\nNavy (see below) has a similar responsibility\nfor charts of oceanic areas.\nAeronautical\ncharts are also NOAA\'s responsibility.\nNOAA still has a\nsmall deep-sea geophysics program and collects towed magnetometer\ndata\non these geophysical cruises.\nBecause of its fisheries responsibilities,\nNOAA is interested in the\nmagnetic field and its relationship\nto the navigation\nand stranding\nof\nmarine mammals.\nNOAA has a major responsibility\ngeophysics\n\nand the\n\nenvironment.\n\nto maintain\nThese\n\ncenters\n\ndata centers related to\nare\n\nresponsible\n\nfor\n\nAPPENDIX\n\nB:\n\nOPERATIONAL\n\nWORKING\n\nGROUP\n\nREPORTS\n\n213\n\ndistributing information from numerous data bases.

These are operational meteorological\nsatellites.\nAlthough the satellites are oriented in space, the boom on which the\nmagnetometer\nsensors will be placed will have no attitude transfer system;\nthus, these satellites will still effectively be only scalar instruments.\nIn\n2005, it is planned to mount fully oriented magnetometers\non the Block\n6 DMSP satellites.\n\nDepartment\n\nof the Air Force\n\nThe Air Force mission requires magnetic field measurements\nas a\ncomponent of its effort to monitor "space weather."\nThus, the primary\ninterest is in the magnetic disturbance vector measured on satellites at the\nfirst Lagrangian point (L-I), at geosynchronous\norbit, in low-Earth orbit,\nand as recorded at ground stations.\nThe Air Force has a secondary\ninterest in the Earth\'s main field only as a baseline from which to measure\nmagnetic disturbances.\n\nAPPENDIX\nB:\n\nOPERATIONAL WORKINGGROUP REPORTS\n\nNational\n\nScience\n\nFoundation\n\n215\n\n(NSF)\n\nThe National Science Foundation funds many programs in geomagnetism-mainly\nthrough the Divisions of Earth Sciences, Ocean Sciences,\nAtmospheric\nSciences, and Polar Programs.\nThere is thus support for a\nrange of studies in ionospheric and magnetospheric\nphysics. Theoretical\nwork on core dynamo problems and experimental work on paleomagnetic\nconstraints are major relevant programs.\nIn addition, there is much work\non tectonic problems and, although there is not much support for the\nanalysis of lithospheric\nmagnetic anomalies except in oceanic areas, the\noverall crustal program within NSF provides important constraints\nfor\nlithospheric\nmodels of magnetic anomalies.\nThere is also some support\nfor electromagnetic\nstudies, both of deep Earth and crustal conductivity.\nOf particular relevance to the geomagnetic\ninitiative is a proposed\nnew NSF program,\nCooperative\nStudies of the Earth\'s Deep Interior\n(CSEDI), which will support research associated with the international\nSEDI program.\nThe NSF Ridge Inter-Disciplinary\nGlobal Experiments\n(RIDGE) program has considerable involvement from scientists in NOAA\n(through the Vents program) and USGS.\nInteraction\nbetween NSF and other agencies occurs in ad hoc\narrangements,\nor informal\nneeded.\n\nand there seems to be little difficulty in setting up formal\ncooperative\nagreements\nwith other federal agencies,\nas\n\nRecommendations\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThe\n\ncurrent\n\nefforts\n\nto\n\ncommence\n\na\n\nsatellite\n\nmission\n\n(ARISTOTELES)\nwith the European\nSpace Agency should\ncontinue.\nIf this mission is not initiated, then other missions\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nshould be pursued--such\nas MFE-Magnolia.\nThe later Block 5 DMSP satellites should be upgraded\n\nby the\n\naddition of a scalar magnetometer\nat the end of the 5-meter boom,\nto provide absolute control on the drift of the vector instruments.\n\n216\n\nTHENATIONALGEOMAGNETIC\nINITIATIVE\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThe Block 6 DMSP satellites should be upgraded to give absolute\nvector measurements\nof the Earth\'s magnetic field to an accuracy\nof 4 nanoteslas per coordinate.\nThe attitude determination\nshould\nbe accurate to 15 arc seconds.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nDiscussions should take place between NOAA and NASA about\nthe possibility of placing magnetometers\non the NOAA polarorbiting satellites.\nEducational concerns of geomagnetism\nshould be pursued.\nEducational concerns might be pursued in the following\nways.\nGovernment\nagencies are encouraged\nto seek student\ninvolvement in their projects whenever possible.\nThis could be\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\naccomplished\nin large part by employment of students during the\nsummer at government facilities.\nIn certain situations, students\nfrom nearby universities\ncould work at a government\nfacility\nduring the school year. Appropriate agencies could fund student\nstipends and expenses through university\ngrants or contracts.\nSince the number of women and minorities entering professional\nscience careers is still small, special encouragement\nshould be\ngiven to these groups.\nThis can be most effectively done at the\nundergraduate\nlevel. Some agencies have student programs at\npresent; they are encouraged\nto study these programs to ensure\nthat they are effective and easy to implement.\n(Some programs\nare known to suffer from rules that are too rigid for effective\nstudent involvement.)\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nAnother\neducational\nprogram\nmight entail visits of\ngovernment\nscientists to universities\nto present scientific talks.\nThis program\nshould be restarted\nby the National\nScience\nFoundation.\nIt affords the opportunity\nto inform and educate\nstudents who are not science majors about interesting government\nresearch.\nPrograms\nthat inform the nonscientist\nabout major\nscientific\nexperiments\nand results are considered\nextremely\nimportant in generating a satisfactory research climate within the\ncountry.\nSome of the classified data collected by the U.S. Navy from\nsurface ships would be of great use to the geomagnetic communi-\n\nAPPENDIX\n\nB:\n\nOPERATIONAL\n\nWORKING\n\nGROUP\n\nREPORTS\n\n217\n\nty. A request should be made to the Navy to release as much data\nas possible to the NOAA National Geodetic Survey for the\nappropriate\nfiltering, binning, or culling under classified protocols.\nInformation\nof this type even if culled, averaged, or\notherwise\nfiltered over a spatial scale of 100 km would be\nextremely useful to regional and main field modelers.\nThe data\nderived in this way could be used to improve the Navy\'s field\nmodel.\nOf greater value would be data averaged over considerably shorter spatial scales (for example, over a few kilometers).\nSuch data could be used in lithospheric magnetic modeling studies\nor in determining the age of the seafloor from seafloor spreading\nanomalies.\nBasic geological knowledge of this sort would be of\ngreat value to the scientific community,\nespecially\nin areas\nsparsely covered by unclassified\ndata.\nDeclassifying\nits data\nwould also be of value to the Navy itself, because the knowledge\nof the crustal age is of predictive use for the determination\nof\nsediment coverage, an important aspect of the acoustic behavior\nof the ocean floor. These filtered data can then be released to the\nNGDC\n\nwith appropriate\n\ncontrols\n\non dissemination,\n\nas prescribed\n\nby the Navy.\nSteps should be taken to implement a satellite program to monitor\nthe L-I Lagrangian point, with 24-hour real time transmission of\ndata to the ground.\nThe effective warning of geomagnetic storms would have\nimmense monetary benefits to the country, and the data obtained\nwould help improve the understanding\nof the external magnetic\nfield of Earth and so provide a better internal field model. These\nsteps should be taken jointly by NASA, NOAA, DOE, and DOD.\nISTP satellites in geostationary orbit should also be used to gather\ndata to study the solar wind.\nFederal agencies (particularly\nNOAA and NASA) should seek\nefficient and inexpensive ways of digitizing analog records from\ngeomagnetic observatories.\nThis might be done by subcontracting\n\n_J\n\n218\n\nTHE NATIONAL\n\nGEOMAGNETIC\n\nto Russian agencies that have the capability\nwork on time and at little expense.\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nINITIATIVE\n\nof completing\n\nthis\n\nThe INTERMAGNET\nprogram and others involving the setting\nup of geomagnetic observatories\nshould be expanded.
