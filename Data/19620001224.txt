Placement of the Thor booster on the\nlaunch stand for the TIROSI1 launch from Cape\nCanaveral.\n\nwas extensively used as a training vehicle by\nthe military services; finally, it was obtained\nby NASA and modified to the form used for the\nTIROS\nlaunches. This modified Thor successfully performed in the launch of the Tmos I\nsatellite itself.\nFigure 10-2 shows the vehicle on the launch\nstand. The launch vehicle stands about 90 feet\nhigh, it is about 8 feet in diameter, and at liftoff it weighs a little over 100,000 pounds. An\nimpressive feature of the launch vehicle is the\nrate at which it consumes oxygen. It consumes\noxygen during the boost phase at the same rate\nas about 6 million people.\nTable 10-1 summarizes the satellite orbital\n\nFIGURE\n3 0-2.
