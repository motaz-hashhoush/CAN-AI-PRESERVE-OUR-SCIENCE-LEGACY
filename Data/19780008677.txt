Division\n\nrnational\n\nABSTRACT\n\n\n\nThis report describes part of a continuing effort both to develop\n\n\nmodels for and to augment the performance of humans controlling remote\n\n\nmanipulators.\n\nThe project plan calls for the performance of several\n\n\n\nstandard tasks with a number of different manipulators, controls, and\n\n\nviewing conditions, using an automated performance measuring system; in\n\n\naddition, the project plan calls for the development of a force-reflecting\n\n\njoystick and supervisory display system.\n\n\nTwo experiments with different approaches to varying the difficulty\n\n\nof the task have been devised:\n-of-freedom task.\n\na peg-in-hole task and a variable degree\xc2\xad\n\n\nThe first uses precision of fit to vary the difficulty\n\n\n\nwhile maintaining four degrees of constraint; the second uses a nearly\n\n\nconstant precision but uses the number of degrees of constrained motion\n\n\nto control the difficulty.\n\n\nExperiments with a cable-connected master-slave manipulator (the\n\n\nMA-il) common to hot cell work have been carried out with both tasks and\n\n\nare reported here as are experiments with a servo-controlled manipulator\n\n\n(the MA-23) with and without force feedback.\n\nFour experiments with the\n\n\n\nAmes Arm to evaluate four different viewing systems (including stereo and\n\n\nhead-aimed stereo displays) were run.\n\n\nTo facilitate man-manipulator interaction, two approaches have been\n\n\nexplored:\n\na force-reflecting control stick and a real-time supervisory\n\n\n\ndisplay concept.\n\nThe control stick has two primary functions:\n\nposition and applying forces.\n\nsensing\n\n\n\nIt permits the monitoring of both position\n\n\n\nand orientation as well as the application of both forces and torques to\n\n\nthe operator\'s hand.\n\nThe desk-top design permits him to control a six\xc2\xad\n\n\naxis manipulator and feel the forces it develops.\n\nThe computer controlled\n\n\n\ndisplay can show the operator how the remote manipulator and its remote\n\n\nsensors are performing in a single graphic image.\n\nSoftware to interact\n\n\n\nwith the system via the keyboard and the force-reflecting controller\n\n\nii\n\n\n\nhas been developed.\n\nPerspective displays of three-dimensional objects\n\n\n\ncan be moved by the controller, as can numeric and analogic displays.\n\n\n\niii\n\n\n\nCONTENTS\n\n\n\nABSTRACT\n\nii\n\n\n.\n\t\n\n......................\n\nOF\nLIST \t ILLUSTRATIONS .........\nOF\nLIST \t TABLES

QUALTY\nviii\n\nI\n\nA.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n\n\nPerformance Evaluation\n\n\nThe first part of this report describes a series of experiments to\n\n\n\ndevelop models for human performance with remote manipulators.\n\nThe proj\xc2\xad\n\n\nect plan calls for the performance of standard tasks with a number of\n\n\ndifferent manipulators, controls, and viewing conditions, using an auto\xc2\xad\n\nmated performance measuring system.\n\nSpecifically this report describes\n\n\n\ntwo tasks--the performance measuring system and the preliminary results\n\n\nof experiments with two manipulators.\nthe first annual reporti\n\n*\n\nThis work is a continuation of\n\n\n\nunder Contract NAS2-8652.\n\n\n\n*The performance measuring system described in Section II uses a\n\n\ntensioned string to measure the distance between the tip of a tool and\n\n\na receptacle into which the tool is to be inserted.\n\nThe string also per\xc2\xad\n\n\nmits the progress into the hole to be monitored as the tool is inserted.\n\n\nFrom records of string length as a function of time, tool trajectories\n\n\nas well as velocities and task times can be determined.\n\nThe system\n\n\n\nmakes a permanent record of the string length 25 times a second as the\n\n\ntool is moved to and into the receptacle.\n\n\nThe tasks are the degree-of-constraint experiment described in the\n\n\nfirst annual report on this project\nMcGovern.2\n\nand the peg-in-hole experiment of\n\n\n\nThe experiment boards have been rebuilt to be more precise\n\n\n\nand to be incorporated into the measuring system.\n\nBoth experiments have\n\n\n\nbeen expanded to use three different moving distances (100, 200, and 400\n\n\nmm) to provide a broader data base for the models.\n\nBoth are performed\n\n\n\nby the same subjects to make the results comparable.\n\n\nThe first of two manipulators chosen for these experiments was the\n\n\nFrench MA-il.\n\nThe MA-lI is a lightweight cable-connected manipulator de\xc2\xad\n\n\nsigned for hot cell\'work.\n\nIt is similar to the Model 8 developed at\n\n\n\nReferences appear on page 113.\n\n\n1\n\n\n\nArgonne Labs and is representative of a large class of manipulators in\n\n\nuse throughout the world in radioactive environments.\n\nSince there are\n\n\n\nthousands of these cable-connected manipulators in use in the world, they\n\n\nprovide a standard for comparison with other types of manipulators.\n\nThey\n\n\n\nprovide the operator with a low mass (5 kg) manipulation link to tasks\n\n\nwith only six degrees of freedom.\n\nThis link essentially removes the\n\n\n\nenormous dexterity and tactile sensibility of the human hand and limits\n\n\nthe operator to motion and sensing with the six degrees of freedom pro\xc2\xad\n\nvided.\n\n\nThe second manipulator chosen was the MA-23 force-reflecting servo\n\n\nmanipulator developed by the French Atomic Energy Commission (CEA).\n\nThis\n\n\n\nmanipulator system may be run with force feedback turned either on or off.\n\n\nIt is one of a handful in the world with this feature.\n\nAn attempt was\n\n\n\nmade to run the experiments with a similar American manipulator, the E-4\n\n\nmanipulator at Fermi*National Accelerator Laboratory, Batavia, Illinois,\n\n\nbut it was not operational at the time scheduled for the experiment.\n\n\nManipulators with force feedback capability were sought to characterize\n\n\nthe changes in performance attributable to force feedback.\n\n\nSections III and IV describe analyses of the data.\n\nComputer programs\n\n\n\nfor determining task time and time for movement of a given distance to\n\n\nthe receptacle have been developed.\n\nResults of these programs are used\n\n\n\nto automatically plot several graphs presenting the data.\n\nTask times,\n\n\n\naccumulated distance, and trajectories showing the distance from the\n\n\nreceptacle as a function of time are presented in these sections.\ntistical tests on the results are described in Section V.\n\nSta\xc2\xad\n\n\nThis work has\n\n\n\nbeen summarized in a paper presented to the Thirteenth Annual Conference\n\n\non Manual Control (Appendix A).\n\n\nAdditional experiments to explore the effects of other manipulators\n\n\nand viewing situations have been carried out but not analyzed.\n\nExperiments\n\n\n\nwith the Ames manipulator and unaided human hand were carried out at Ames\n\n\nResearch Center to determine the effect of viewing systems on experimental\n\n\nresults.\n\nThe peg-in-hole tests run with direct viewing, TV viewing,\n\n\n\nstereo TV viewing, and the head-aimed viewing system developed at Ames\n\n\nResearch Center are described in Section VI.\n\n\n\n2\n\n\n\nB.\n\nSupervisory Control System\n\n\nThe second part of this report describes the initial developments\n\n\n\nof a second-generation control system for remote manipulators.\n\nThe con\xc2\xad\n\n\ntrol system consists of the force-reflecting control stick, described\n\n\nin Section VII, and a graphics terminal for "looking\' into the operations\n\n\nof the system, described in Section VIII.\n\n\nThe force-reflecting controller permits free motion of the operator\'s\n\n\nhand in a working volume 30 cm on a side.\n\nAn articulated set of linkages\n\n\n\nmeasures the position (X, Y, and Z) and orientation (roll, pitch, and\n\n\nyaw) of a grip held in the operator\'s hand.\n\nBy means of flexible cables,\n\n\n\neach of the linkages is back-driven to apply forces along the X, Y,\nZ axes and torques around the roll, pitch, and yaw axes.\n\nand\n\n\n\nIn the case\n\n\n\nof manipulation, the controller can be a force-reflecting master.\n\nOther\n\n\n\napplications include vehicle control, tracking, man-machine interaction\n\n\nwith a data base, and instructional uses.\n\nWhen the controller is inter\xc2\xad\n\n\nfaced to a computer, there are several new possibilities for simulation\n\n\nand interaction using modeling techniques.\n\n\nThe graphics terminal is a OT-40 manufactured by the Digital Equip\xc2\xad\n\nment Corporation.\n\nSoftware for the terminal permits the human operator\n\n\n\nto quickly review, through position, velocity, force, tactile, and other\n\n\nsensors, a variety of visual data presentations concerning a manipulator\'s\n\n\nperformance.\n\nEntire display modules (computer programs)\n\nare down-loaded\n\n\n\nfrom the KL-10 host time-sharing computer in a few seconds.\n\nThe modules\n\n\n\nconvert the incoming analog sensor data into graphic form and provide\n\n\nsupporting displays of textual, numeric, and analogic information.\n\nAt\n\n\n\nthe bottom of the display screen is a permanent "teletype window" that\n\n\npermits simultaneous interaction between the operator, the graphics ter\xc2\xad\n\nminal, and the host computer(s).\n\n\n\n3\n\n\n\nII\n\nPORTABLE DATATAKER\n \n\n\nA portable data collection system was designed and constructed to\n\n\nobtain and compare performance of different teleoperators.\n\nThe system\n\n\n\nmeasures the distance from a tool to a receptacle in which the tool is to\n\n\nbe inserted.\n\nThe datataker records the distance between the end of the\n\ntool and the bottom of the receptacle as a function of time.\n\nThis distance\n\nis measured by a dacron string of low extensibility to the nearest 2 am\nand is punched on paper tape at the rate of 25 measurements/see.\nrange is\n\ncalibrated from 0 to 510 mm in\n\nThe\n\n256 steps (8 bits).\n\nThe entire experimental arrangement is shown in Figure 1.\n\nThe ex\xc2\xad\n\nperimenter operates the tape perforator at the left, while the subject\nmanipulates the tool held on the right.\nthe tool and the string puller.\n\nDetails of the string dispenser and mea\xc2\xad\n\nsuring system are shown in Figure 2.\nviously described\n\nThe measuring string connects\n\nThis system is similar to that pre\xc2\xad\n\nfor measuring the X, Y,\n\nand Z coordinates of the\n\nmanipulated tool, except that a single string is used.\n\nThis simplification\n\nin measuring was suggested by the results of two previous studies using a\nmore sophisticated datataker.2\n\ns\n\nIn these studies the distance between\n\nhole and tool as a function of time was the most important parameter in\nexplaining the experimental results.\n\nThis measurement could be used to\n\n\n\ndivide the task into different therbligs and to proportion a fixed amount\n\n\nof time for each one.\n\n\nThe new datataker is well-adapted to the Ames Arm and other rigid\n\n\nmanipulators that tend to bump the task board and move it around.\n\nIn\n\n\n\nthis case the measuring system is located inside the task board, and even\n\n\nif it is moved the origin remains the same.\n\n\nDetails of the measuring unit are shown in Figures 3 and 4.\nare four sets of receptacles for the unit:\n\nThere\n\n\n\none round hole in a metal plate\n\n\n\nfor the peg-in-hole task and three irregular-shaped holes for

increasing by I for\n \n\neach repeated trajectory\n\n\n\nThe rules for recording identification codes follow:\n\n\n(1) \t Blank leader is used to separate each code and trajectory\n\n\nrecording.\n\n\n(2) \t Codes are recorded only when a change occurs.\n\n\n\n10\n\n\n\nFor example, only when Subject 3 starts manipulating is the code 203\n\n\npunched.\n\nSimilarly, only when Experiment 1 begins is 301 punched, and\n\n\nonly for the first insertion is the two-part condition identification\n\n\n\npunched.\n\nBefore each insertion a consecutive run identification number\n\n\nis punched (1, 21 3, 4, and so forth). Repeating the run identification\n\n\n\nnumber in this fashion permits a run to be repeated if a difficulty de\xc2\xad\n\nvelops: when two Run 2s are recorded in sequence, the first punched data\n\n\nare to be disregarded and the second data kept for Run 2.\n\n\nThe length of the string is calibrated at the beginning of the ex\xc2\xad\n\nperiment and whenever the string breaks or is replaced. Calibration is\n\n\ndone in the following manner:\n\nthe tip of the tool being used is placed\n\n\n\nflush with the top of the receptacle (defining the entrance to the hole\n\n\nas zero distance), and the number 300 (Experiment 0) and the string length\n\n\nare punched.\n\nThis is done by setting 300 on the switches and briefly\n\n\n\npressing the LEADER, CODE, LEADER, and DATA buttons in that sequence.\n\n\nB.\n\nComputer Processing of Paper Tape\n\n\n\nIntegral to the data punching scheme just outlined is the computer\n\n\nprocessing scheme for reducing the data. Both must use the same rules.\n\n\nIn addition to keeping track of the various codes for each manipulation,\n\n\nthe data reduction program given in Appendix B also makes a set of mea\xc2\xad\n\nsurements on the trajectories. A sample of the measurements is shown in\n\n\nFigure 6; they represent some of those made by the program.\n\n\nThe measurements made by the program are briefly described below:\n\n\nReaction Time--Reaction time is the time after the experimenter\n\n\nturns on the punch, which is the audible signal for the subject\n\n\nto begin, until the subject pulls the string 4 mm from its ini\xc2\xad\n\ntial length (time zero).\n\n\nZero Length--Zero length is the string length when the tool is\n\n\nat the entrance to the receptacle. This length is determined\n\n\nfrom the calibration recordings (Experiment 300).\n\n\nStart Distance--Start distance is the difference between the\n\n\nstring distance at time zero and zero length, as defined above.\n\n\nTask Time--Task time is the time from when the tool is first\n\n\nmoved until it has been inserted 25 mm into the receptacle.\n\n\n\nii\n\n\n\n300\n\nREACTION\nTI ME\n\nTIM

degree-of-constraint (DOC) experiment was carried out with the\n\n\ntask board previously described and a set of special tools.\n\nThe task\n\n\n\nconsists of moving a previously grasped tool a fixed distance and insert\xc2\xad\n\ning it into a receptacle.\n\nThe tools and receptacles were designed to\n\n\n\nconstrain the translational and rotational movements of the fitting task\n\n\none by one, making the task progressively more difficult.\n\nTool trajec\xc2\xad\n\n\ntories were recorded as a function of time, using the data acquisition\n\n\nsystem described in Section II.\n\n\n\nA.\n\nApparatus\n\n\nThe matching of the receptacles and tools for the six tasks is illu\xc2\xad\n\n\nstrated in Figure 7.\n\nDimensions for the set of four tools and three re\xc2\xad\n\n\nceptacles are given in Appendix C.\n\nThe tools are held, around their cy\xc2\xad\n\n\nlindrical handles, in the jaws of the manipulator.\n\nThe grip is secured\n\n\n\nby a small C-clamp to ensure that the tool does not slip in the jaws.\n\n\n\nB.\n\nManipulators\n\n\nTwo different manipulators were chosen for use in the experiment:\n\n\n\na lightweight master-slave manipulator (MA-lI)\n\nof the family used for hot\n\n\n\ncells and a heavy duty servo manipulator (MA-23) that has more general\xc2\xad\n\npurpose use.\n\nThese manipulators are shown in Figures 8 and 9.\n\nTechnical\n\n\n\ndescriptions including dimensions, load capability, speed, and backlash\n\n\nfor the MA-lI and MA-23, respectively, are given in Appendices D and E.\n\n\nBoth manipulators were developed by the French Atomic Energy Commission\n\n\nat Saclay, France, for radioactive handling by Dr. Jean Vertut\'s Environ\xc2\xad\nmental Protection group.\n\nThe relation between the subject

the 6 X 3 X 8 factorial design shown\n \n\n\nin Figure 11.\n\nThe experiment block was run in the sequential order shown\n\n\n\nin Table 1 for one subject and in the reverse order for a second subject,\n\n\nto balance the effect of learning curves on the results.\n\nFor each of the\n\n\n\ndistance and DOC combinations of Table 1, eight insertions of the tool\n\n\ninto the receptacle were made.\n\n\nThis design is similar to that previously used,\n\nexcept that three\n\n\n\ndistances, 100, 200, and 400 mm, are used instead of the single distance\n\n\n(490 mm) previously used.\n\nThese distances are chosen to be the same as\n\n\n\nthose of the peg-in-hole experiment.\n\nThey also increase by multiples of\n\n\n\ntwo for convenience of using and testing Fitts\' law.4\n\n\n\nD.\n\nProcedure\n\n\nThe experimental protocol was as follows:\n\nfor each of the sequential\n\n\n\nconditions called out in Table 1, a new tool, if called for, was rigidly\n\n\nfixed inside the manipulator jaws by means of a small C-clamp.\n\nA new\n\n\n\nreceptacle, if called for, was mounted on top of the measuring unit.\n\nThe\n\n\n\nsubject was permitted to make a few practice movements, and, if a new tool\n\n\nor receptacle were being introduced for the first time, the subject was\n\n\nencouraged to practice a few times.\n\nFor each of the eight repeated in\xc2\xad\n\n\nsertions, the subject positioned the tip of the tool over the appropriate\n\n\nstarting mark (100, 200, or 400 mm).\n\nThe experimenter punched the run\n\n\n\nnumber, waited a second or two. and switched on the punch, which made a\n\n\ndistinct noise.\n\nWhen the subject heard the noise, he proceeded to move\n\n\n\nthe tool into the receptacle.\n\nWhen the tool tip disappeared inside the\n\n\n\nreceptacle (about 50 mm) the experimenter turned off the punch and the\n\n\nsubject returned the tool to the starting mark to prepare for the next\n\n\ninsertion.\n\n\n\nE.\n\nMA-Il

the\n\n\nsame test subjects.\n\nThe object of the task was to insert a set of pegs.\n \n\n\ninto a round receptable.\n\nThe difficulty of the experiment was varied by\n\n\nThe experimental apparatus is basically\n\n\n\nusing pegs of different diameter.\n2\n\nthe same as that used by McGovern.\n\nThe same pegs were used but a more\n\n\n\nprecise receptacle was built, the previous one being found to be 0.33 mm\n\n\noversize and 0.2 mm out of round.\n\n\n\nA.\n\nApparatus\n\n\nThe apparatus consists of the task board as shown in Figure 3 with\n\n\n\na round receptacle and a set of cylindrical pegs.\n\nThe dimensions of the\n\n\n\nround receptacle and the pegs are given in Appendix B.\n\n\n\nB.\n\nManipulators\n\n\nThe MA-il and MA-23, described in Section III, were used in

of different\n\n\ndiameter replace the six different DOC conditions.\n\nThe design is a 7 X\n\n\n\n3 X 8 factorial design similar to that shown in Figure 11.\n\nSeven pegs\n \n\n\nwere used (Pegs 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14, which are dimensioned in Ap\xc2\xad\n\npendix B); three distances were used (100-, 200-, and 400-mm trajectories);\n \n\nand-8 repeated runs were made with each condition.\n\nThe experimental order\n\n\n\nis the same as that shown in Table 1 with the peg numbers (starting with\n\n\nPeg 2) replacing the ascending degrees of constraint.\n\n\n\n29\n\n\n\nPRECED]IG PAGE BLANK NOT FILMED\n\nD.\n\nProcedure\n\n\nThe experimental procedure was the same as that described in Section III.\n\n\n\nE.\n\nMA-li Preliminary Results\n\n\nBasic task times for the peg-in-hole task are shown in Figure 18.\n\n\n\nThese times increase as the difficulty of the task (peg number) increases.\n\n\nThe times are longer, particularly with the largest pegs, than those of\n\n\nthe DOC task, indicating an increased difficulty.\n\nDifferences between\n\n\n\nthe three trajectory distances appear to be constant, all three changing\n \n\nin the same increasing manner with peg number.\n\nThis indicates that the\n\n\n\ntimes are accounted for by the sum of two functions; one a function of\xc2\xad\n\ntrajectory length, the other a function of peg number (difficulty).\n \n\nSince the tolerance of fit of each peg is half that of the preceding\n\n\npeg, the abscissa on Figure 18 is also a measure of task difficulty as\n \n\ndefined by Fitts.4\ncurvature:\n\nAn interesting feature of the results is their upward\n\n\n\ntask time is an accelerating function of difficulty, whereas\n\n\n\nFitts\' law predicts a linear function of difficulty.\n\nStatistical analyses\n\n\n\nto test the linearity of the curves as well as the independence of tra\xc2\xad\n\njectory length and difficulty (peg number) are planned.\n\n\nApproach times to different distances to the receptacle were obtained\n\n\nand are shown in Figure 19.\n\nThese results are similar to those of the DOC\n\n\n\nexperiment previously described (see Figure 13).\n\nTo within 10 mm of the\n\n\n\nreceptacle, the task time is practically independent of peg size.\n\nThe\n\n\n\ninsertion time, the time to move from 0 to -25 mm on the graphs, varies\n\n\ngreatly with task difficulty.\n\nInsertion time is about six times longer\n\n\n\nwith the most difficult peg (Peg 14) than with the smallest peg (Peg 2).\n \n\nTrajectories for Pegs 2, 8, and 14 are shown in Figure 20.\n\nThe tra\xc2\xad\n\n\njectories show a transition between the smooth insertions with Peg 2 to\n \n\nthe two-stage insertion with Peg 14, where the insertion

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS OF THE PREVIOUS EXPERINENTS\n\n\n\nThe four experiments described in Sections III and IV were given\n\n\nstatistical analyses to determine whether differences between manipulators\n\n\nand force-feedback conditions were statistically significant.\n\nAnalyses\n\n\n\nof variance were performed on the total task times to obtain the statistics\n\n\nfor testing these hypotheses.\n\nA.\n\nThe results are given below.\n\n\n\nMA-11 Manipulator--6-DOC Task\n\n\nTask time is a strong function of the degrees of constraint [F(5,252)\n\n=\n\n57.10, p < 0.0011, and there is insufficient evidence to show that it\n\n\nis not a linear function [F(4,252) = 0.42, p > 0.05].\n\nSimilarly, the task\n\n\n\ntime is a strong function of trajectory length [F(2,252) = 93.08,\n\n\np < 0.001] and there is insufficient evidence to show that it is not a\n\n\nlinear function [F(1,252) = 0.01, p > 0.051.\n\nAlso, there is insufficient\n\n\n\nevidence to show an interaction (or dependence) between these two linear\n\n\nfunctions [F(10,252) = 1.62, p > 0.05].\n\nWith the results of these five\n\n\n\ntests, we may assume a linear model of the form\n\n\n\n(1)\n\n\n\nTask time = KI(DOC) + K2 (trajectory length)\n\nwhere KI and K2 are linear functions.\n\nThus, the total task time may be\n\n\n\nbroken down into the sum of two linear, independent functions.\n\n\n\nB.\n\nMA-11 Manipulator--Peg-in-Hole Task\n\n\nTask time is a strong function of the peg number [F(1,294) = 56.49,\n\np < 0.001] and is nonlinear [F(4,294)\n\n12.4, p < 0001].\n\n=\n\nAs with the\n\nDOC task, task time is a strong function of the trajectory length\n[F(2,294,)\n\n=\n\n\n43.80, p < 0.001] but there is insufficient evidence to show\n\n\n\nthat it is nonlinear [F(1,294) = 0.05, p > 0.05].\npeg and trajectory length [F(12,294)\n\nORIGINAL PAGE IS\n\nOF POOR QUALITY\n\n=\n\nThe interaction between\n\n\n\n1.69, p >0.,05] is not statistically\n\n\n\n!37\n\n\n\nsignificant, again suggesting independence between these two parameters.\n\n\nWith this information, we can assume the following model for this task:\n\n\n\nTask time = f1 (peg) + K 2 (trajectory length)\n\nwhere f\n\n(2)\n\n,\n\nis an accelerating function of the peg-number and K2 is the same\n\n\n\nlinear function we had with the 6-DOC task [Equation (1)].\n\n\n\nC.\n\nMA-23 Manipulator--6-DOC Task With and Without Force Feedback\n\n\nTask-completion times with force feedback are significantly shorter\n\n\n\nthan without force feedback [F(1,504) = 68.91, p < 0.001].\n\nTask-completion\n\n\n\ntimes are also strong functions of the degrees of constraint and trajectory\n\n\nlength, both being statistically significant (p < 0.001).\n\nTask-completion\n\n\n\ntime is not a linear function of the DOC as it was with the MA-ll, since\n\n\nthe nonlinear term [F(4,504) = 26.62, p < 0.001]\nicant.\n\nis statistically signif\xc2\xad\n\n\nThe nonlinear term for trajectory length, [F(1,504) = 3.26,\n\n\n\np > 0.05] is not statistically significant, again suggesting a linear\n\n\nfunction of trajectory length.\n\nOf the three interactions between these\n\n\n\nthree variables, force by DOC is significant (p < 0.001), force by tra\xc2\xad\n\njectory length is not significant (p > 0.05), and DOC by trajectory\n\n\nlength is (p < 0.001).\n\n\nBecause of these interactions, the MA-23 results are more difficult\n\n\nto interpret than those of the MA-ll.\n\n\n\nD.\n\nMA-23 Manipulator--Peg-in-Hole Task With and Without Force Feedback\n\n\nTask-completion times with force feedback are significantly shorter\n\n\n\nthan without it [F(1,588) = 129, p < 0.001].\n\nTask-completion times are\n\n\n\nalso strong functions of the peg size and the trajectory length, both\n\n\nbeing statistically significant at the 0.001 level.\n\nTask-completion\n\n\n\ntimes are nonlinear functions of the peg number, as with the MA-1, be\xc2\xad\n\ncause the nonlinear term is statistically significant at the 0.001 level\n\n\n,[F(5,588) = 19.16,. p < 0.001].\n\nThe nonlinear term in the trajectory\n\n\n\n.length [F(1,588) = 0.19, p > 0.05]\n\nis not significant, indicating that,\n\n\n\n"38\n\n\n\nagain, the time is a linear function of trajectory length.\n\nOf the three\n\n\n\ninteractions, force feedback and peg number interact significantly\n\n\n(p < 0.001), whereas force feedback and trajectory length do not\n\n\n(p > 0.05) and peg number and trajectory length do not (p > 0.05).\n\nThese\n\n\n\nresults indicate that there are two models for MA-23 performance in this\n\n\ntask.\n\nWith force feedback we have\n\n\n\nTask time\n\n=\n\n(3)\n\nff(peg) + K2(trajectory length)\n\nand without force feedback we have\n\n\n\nTask time = fj(peg) + K2 (trajectory length)\n\nwhere the two curving functions of peg size, ff and f-,\n\n,\n\n(4)\n\nare different,\n\n\n\nand the linear functions of trajectory length, I(2, are identical.\n\n\n\nE.\n\nSummary\n\n\nOne of the interesting results of these anaiyses is that in all\n\n\n\nfour cases analyzed above, task time is directly proportional to trajectory\n\n\nlength.\n\nThus the distance moved appears to be a basic measure of manip\xc2\xad\n\n\nulator performance, independent of manipulator, force feedback, and task.\n\n\nThis basic result is explored further and modeled in the paper reprinted\n\n\nin Appendix A.\n\n\n\nORIGINAL PAGE IS\nOF POOR QUA 2ITSI\n39\n\nVI\n\nVIEWING EXPERIMENTS WITH THE AMES ARM\n\n\n\nA series of manipulation experiments were run using the Ames Arm to\n\n\nperform the peg-in-hole task described in Section IV.\n\nThe object of the\n\n\n\nevaluations is to distinguish between the abilities to perform the task\n\n\n(which ranged from low- to high-precision fits) as a function of the\n\n\nviewing condition.\n\nThe following

monitor\n\n\n\nfor the GT-40 Graphics Display System.\n\nUpon completion of the analog-to\xc2\xad\n\n\ndigital interface, this monitor will permit the performance of six-degree\xc2\xad\n\nRate and position controllers of various\n\n\n\nof constraint step-tracking tasks,\n\ndesigns can be used to drive a perspective (and potentially stereoscopic)\n\n\nCRT display.\n\nStatic and moving objects can be drawn with a minimum of\n\n\n\noverhead computation.\n\nThe display monitor is designed to become an inte\xc2\xad\n\n\ngral part of a supervisory control system for manipulator control, as\n\n\n\nshown in Figure 30.\n\n\nThe monitor\'s prime function is\n\nto permit a human operator to quickly\n\nreview, through position, velocity, force, tactile and other sensors, a\nvariety of visual data presentations concerning a manipulator\'s performance.\nThe GT-40 with range-sensor display is shown in Figure 31.\nBy \t\nusing a rate controller (MIT controller)s or a position controller\n\n\n(force-reflecting controller, previously described), the operator may\n\n\npoint to and otherwise interact with a three-dimensional scene--that is,\n\n\nthe operator may observe and intervene in an automatic process as well as\n\n\nassume direct control of manipulators and other positioning devices.\n\n\nThe goal\'was to develop for the GT-40 Graphics Display a resident\n\n\nmonitor with the following capabilities:\n \n\n* \tConstant communication with a host computer (or computers).\n\n\n* \t Quick down-line loading of display modules from\'the KL-10 computer.\n* \t Performance of fast coordinate transformations and perspective\ndisplay of objects.\n* \t Digital and analogic, text, and perspective displays of various\nquantities.\n* \t Simple

monitor\'s repertoire.\n\n\na \tFlexible insertion and deletion of display elements.\n\n\nThe resulting display monitor is centered around the concept of dis\xc2\xad\n\nplay modules.\n\nThe modules are downline loadable program segments, which\n\n\n\ncontrol the conversion of sensor data into a useable form and provide\n\n\ndisplay of textual information.\n\nFrequently used display modules can be\n\n\n\nloaded as part of the resident display monitor, thus permitting quicker\n\n\naccess to them.\n\nThe structure of the display monitor is shown in Figure\n\n\n\n32.\n\n\nThe monitor\'s CRT display includes a "teletype window" at the bottom\n\n\nof the screen that permits simultaneous interaction between the monitor\n\n\nand the host computer(s).\n\nThus, display modules may be edited, recompiled,\n\n\n\nand reloaded even as you watch them in operation.\n\nOther types of commu\xc2\xad\n\n\nnication concerning manipulator performance may occur.\n\nThe host computer(s)\n\n\n\nmay send messages to the operator in three ways:\n\n\n* \tMessages typed to the teletype window\n\n\n" \tRemote starting of resident display modules.\n\n\n* \tDownline loading and starting of display modules.\n\n\nThe operator may talk to the host in three ways:\n\n\n* \tText input from the keyboard\n\n\n* \tAutomatic text typeout via commands typed at the keyboard\n\n\n* \tAutomatic text typeout initiated by a display module.\n\n\nThe communications interface is fast enough (I character/msec) to\n\n\nenable the host computer to specify the position and orientation of a\n\n\nmoving object at 50 Hz.\n\nSuch dedicated use of the serial communications\n\n\n\nline is probably not advisable and such data is best transmitted via the\n\n\nunibus.\n\nIt does, however, seem quite reasonable for the host to place\n\n\n\nstatic objects in the scene with a message length of 30 characters.\n\n\n\n56\n\n\n\nUse of the Display Monitor\n\n\n\nB.\n\nSeveral modules have been written to illustrate a variety of display\n\n\ntechniques possible with the monitor.\n\nThe modules can be installed with\n\n\n\ncommands that are explained with a help command (See Figure 33).\n\n\nThe command ";4"\n\n(without quotes) currently loads and starts a dem\xc2\xad\n\n\nonstration program that exercises most of the system subroutines.\n\nThe\n\n\n\nprogram positions a cube on the screen as a function of six values read\n\n\nby the analog-to-digital converter.\n\nAfter scaling and offsetting, the\n\n\n\nsix parameters are used to position the cube via the object transformation\n\n\npreviously given for the grip of the force-reflecting controller.\n\nA rate\n\n\n\nmode is also available so that the cube may be caused to move the various\n\n\nlinear and angular rates (See Figure 34).\n\n\nThe routine computes the cube position at about 40 Hz.\n\nThis rate\n\n\n\ncould be increased by precomputing the elements of several intermediate\n\n\ntransformations rather than by multiplying six rather sparce matrices.\n\n\nThe homogeneous transform representations are used throughout the system.\n\n\nThe demonstration program uses screw transforms to effect the object trans\xc2\xad\n\nThis is simply a rotation about, and a translation along,\n\n\n\nformations.\n\na specified axis and easily lends itself to homogeneous representation.\n\n\nIt provides an unambiguous specification of relative positions and orien\xc2\xad\n\ntations.\n\n\nA second target or marker cube is displayed at an arbitrary static\n\n\nposition.\n\nThis location may be changed by the introduction of the\n\n\n\naddress of a new transform to the routine.\n\nThus, in a positioning ex\xc2\xad\n\n\nperiment, new target locations can be installed simply.\n\nAlternatively,\n\n\n\nthe target location may be equated to the current grip location, thus\n\n\npermitting the operator to leave a marker in six-dimensional space and\n\n\nmove it at will.\n\nThe display of obstacles and points of interest is a\n\n\n\nsimple extension of these processes\n\n(See Figure 35).\n\n\n\nC. \t Display Mathematics\n\n\nT,.

Hill\nSRI International\nMenlo Park, CA\n\nABSTRACT\n\n\n\nThis paper describes the results from two manipulators on a peg-in\xc2\xad\n\nhole task, which is part of a \'continued effort to develop models for\n\n\nhuman performance with remote manipulators. \'Task difficulty is varied by\n\n\nchanging the diameter of the peg to be inserted in a 50 mm diameter hole.\n\n\nAn automatic measuring system records the distance between the tool being\n\n\nheld by the manipulator and the receptacle into which it is to be inserted.\n\n\nThe data from repeated insertions are processed by computer to determine\n\n\ntask times, accumulated distances, and trajectories. Experiments with\n\n\nboth the MA-il cable-connected master-slave manipulator common to hot cell\n\n\nwork and the MA-23 servo-controlled manipulator (with and without force\n\n\nfeedback) are described. Comparison of these results with previous re\xc2\xad\n\nsults of the Ames Manipulator shows that force feedback provides a con\xc2\xad\n\nsistent advantage.\n\n\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n\n\nThe task investigated in this paper is the peg-in-hole experiment\n\n\npreviously examined by McGovern I and\'Hill.2 The experiment board has been\n\n\nrebuilt to be more precise and to be incorporated into the measuring sys\xc2\xad\n\ntem.\n\nThe experiment has been expanded to use three different moving dis\xc2\xad\n\n\ntances (100, 200, and 400 mm) to provide a broader data base for the\n\n\nmodels.\n\n\nTwo manipulators were chosen for these experiments.\n\nThe first was\n\n\n\nthe French MA-Il, a lightweigbt cable-connected manipulator designed for\n\n\nhot cell work.\n\nSimilar to the Model 8 developed at Argonne Labs, it is\n\n\n\nThis work was supported by the National Aeronautics and Space Adminis\xc2\xad\n\ntration under Contract NAS2-8652 with Stanford Research Institute.\n \n\n71\n\n\n\n-R=DING PAGE BLANK NOT Fmim\n\nrepresentative of a large class of manipulators in use throughout the\n\n\nworld in radioactive environments.\n\nWith about 30,000 cable-connected\n\n\n\nmanipulators in use in the world, they provide a standard for comparison\n\n\nwith other types of manipulators.\n\nThey offer the operator a low mass\n\n\n\n(5 kg) manipulation link to tasks with only six degrees of freedom.\n\nThis\n\n\n\nlink essentially removes the enormous dexterity and tactile sensibility\n\n\nof the human band and limits the operator to motion and sensing with the\n\n\nsix degrees of freedom provided.\n\n\nThe second manipulator chosen was the MA-23 force reflecting servo\n\n\nmanipulator developed by the French Atomic Energy Commission (CEA).\n\nThis\n\n\n\nmanipulator system may be run with force feedback either turned on or\n\n\noff.\n\nIt is one of about 20 manipulators in the world with this feature.\n\n\n\nAn attempt was made to run the experiments with a similar American manipu\xc2\xad\n\nlator, the E-4 manipulator at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory,\n\n\nBatavia, Illinois, but it was not operational at the time scheduled for\n\n\nthe experiment.\n\nManipulators with force feedback capability were sought\n\n\n\nto characterize the changes in performance attributable to force feedback.\n\n\nThe performance measuring system is based on a tensioned string that\n\n\nmeasures the distance between the tip of a tool and a receptacle into\n\n\nwhich the tool is to be inserted.\n\nThe string also permits the progress\n\n\n\ninto the hole to be monitored as the tool is inserted.\n\nFrom records of\n\n\n\nstring length as a function of time, tool trajectories as well as veloc\xc2\xad\n\nities and task times can be determined.\n\nThe system makes a permanent\n\n\n\nrecord of the string length 25 times a second as the tool is moved to and\n\n\ninto the receptacle.\n\n\n\nPORTABLE DATATAKER\n\n\nA portable data collection system was designed and constructed to\n\n\nobtain and compare performance of different teleoperators.\n\nThe system\n\n\n\nmeasures the distance from a tool to a receptacle in which the tool is\n\n\nto be inserted.\n\nThe datataker records the distance between the end of\n\n\n\nthe tool and the bottom of the receptacle as a function of time.\n\nThis\n\n\n\ndistance is measured by a dacron string of low extensibility to the\n\n\n\n72\n\n\n\nnearest 2 mm and is punched on paper tape at the rate of 25 measurements/\n\n\nsec.\n\nThe range is calibrated from 0 to 510 mm in 256 steps (8 bits).\n\n\nThe entire experimental arrangement is shown in Figure 1.\n\nThe ex\xc2\xad\n\n\nperimenter operates the tape perforator, while the subject manipulates\n\n\n\nSTRING\n\nTOOL\n\nR

CONFIGURATION WITH MEASURING UNIT-AND ACCESSORY TABLE\n\nThe measuring string connects the tool and the string puller.\n\n\n\nThis system is similar to that previously described\n\n2\n\nfor measuring the\n\n\n\nX, Y, and Z coordinates of the manipulated tool, except that a single\n\n\nstring is used.\n\nThis simplification in measuring was suggested by the\n\n\n1,3\n\nresults of two previous studies using a more sophisticated datataker.\n\n\n\nIn these studies the distance between hole and tool as a function of time\n\n\nwas the most important parameter in explaining the experimental results.\n\n\nThis measurement could be used to divide the task into different therbligs\n\n\nand to proportion a fixed amount of time for each one.\n\nDetailed descrip\xc2\xad\n\n\ntions of the equipment including dimensions of the task boards and opera\xc2\xad\ntion of the datataker are given in a technical report. 4\n\n73\n\nOf e0\n\n\n\nA data reduction program reads the paper tapes and

after the experimenter\nturns on the punch, which is the audible signal for the subject\nto begin, until the subject pulls the string 4 mm from its ini\xc2\xad\ntial length (time zero).\nZero

RESULTS\n\n\nThe peg-in-hole experiment was run with two subjects in the manner\n \n\npreviously described and the resulting trajectories analyzed by computer\n\n\nprogram to obtain task times and details on the trajectories.\n\nTask com\xc2\xad\n\n\npletion time is defined as the time from the beginning of the move until\n \n\nthe tip of the tool is inserted 25 mm into the receptacle.\n\nAt this point\n\n\n\nthe tool is first inside the 25 mm thick receptacle, and the angular and\n\n\ntranslational degrees of freedom are constrained as determined by the\n\n\ngeometry of the tool and receptacle.\n\n\nBasic task times for the peg-in-hole task are shown in Figure 6.\n\n\nThese times increase as the difficulty of the task (peg number) increases.\n\n\nDifferences between the three trajectory lengths appear to be constant,\n\n\nall three increasing with peg number.\n\nThis suggests that the times are\n\n\n\naccounted for by the sum of two functions; one a function of trajectory\n\n\nlength, the other a function of peg number (difficulty).\n\n\nSince the precision of fit of each peg is double that of the preceding\n\n\none, the abscissa on Figure 6 is also a measure of task difficulty as\n\n\n.7\n\ndefined by Fitts.\ncurvature:\n\nAn interesting feature of the results is their upward\n\n\n\ntask time is an accelerating function of difficulty, whereas\n\n\n\nFitts law predicts a linear function of difficulty.\n\nAnalyses of variance\n\n\n\nwere performed on the total task times to obtain the statistics for testing\n\n\nhypotheses about these functions.\n \n\nTask time is a strong function of the peg number [F(1,294) = 56.49,\n\n\np < 0.001] and is nonlinear [F(4,294) = 12.4, p < 0.001].\n\nTask time is\n\n\n\nalso a strong function

part of a program to determine the advantages of force feedback\n\n\nin different manipulation tasks, the Peg-in-hole task was run on an MA-23\n\n\nmanipulator with and without force feedback.\n\nThe comparison was made\n\n\n\nwith two subjects who served in both the force and no-force conditions.\n\n\nThe experiment was balanced for practice effects by starting one subject\n\n\non the force and the other on the no-force condition and running the two\n\n\nthrough the design in reverse directions.\n\n\nThe task times shown in Figure 8 are of the same shape as those of\n\n\nthe MA-il.\n\nGenerally, the MA-23 is 30 to 40% slower without force feed\xc2\xad\n\n\nback than with it.\n\nThere are no distinctive changes as the peg number\n\n\n\nincreases except for the most difficult peg (Peg 14).\n\nHere the insertion\n\n\n\ntime is doubled when force feedback is removed.\n\n\nAn analysis of variance of the MA-23 task times shows that times\nwith force feedback are significantly shorter than without it [F(1,588\n129, p < 0.001].\n\n=\n\nTask completion times are also strong functions of the\n\n\n\npeg and the trajectory length, both being statistically significant at\n\n\nthe 0.001 level.\n\nTask completion times are nonlinear functions of the\n\n\n\npeg number, as with the MA-Il, because the nonlinear term is statistically\n\n\nsignificant at the 0.001 level [F(5,588) = 19.16, p < 0.001].\n\nThe non\xc2\xad\n\n\nlinear term in the trajectory length [F(1,588) = 0.19, p > 0.05] is not\n\n\nsignificant, indicating that, again, the time is a linear function of\n\n\ntrajectory length.\n\nOf the three interactions, force feedback and peg\n\n\n\nnumber interact significantly (p < 0.001), whereas force feedback and\n\n\ntrajectory length do not (p > 0.05), and peg number and trajectory length\n\n\ndo not (p > 0.05).\n\nThese results indicate that there are two models for\n\n\n\nMA-23 performance in this task.\n\nWith force feedback we have\n\n\n\nTask time = ff(peg) + K2 (trajectory length)\n\n(2)\n\n\n\nand without force feedback we have\n\n\n\nTask time = ff(peg) + K 2 (trajectory length)\n\n81\n\n\n\n(3)\n\n6,\n400 mm\n5\n\nNO

and fE of peg size are different, and\n\n\nthe linear functions of K2 of trajectory length are identical.\n\n\nThe trajectories shown in Figure 9 also indicate the general reduc\xc2\xad\n\ntion in task time with force feedback.\n\nThere is a slowing down near the\n\n\n\nreceptacle entrance (between 0 and 10 mm from receptacle) when force feed\xc2\xad\n\nback is absent, and the insertions take about twice as long without force\n\n\nfeedback as with it.\n\nThe general increase in time without force feedback\n\n\n\nis apparent throughout the results; gross trajectories as well as fitting\n\n\nmovements require more time.\n\nWith the shortest trajectory (100 mm from\n\n\n\nthe receptacle) gross motion and fitting are intertwined, and it may be\n\n\nimpossible to separate these motions (or therbligs) from the data without\n\n\na model.\n\n\n\nSUMMARY\n\n\nThe formulation for the peg-in-hole task with the two manipulators\n\n\n(Equations 1, 2, and 3) shows that task time is a sum of two independent\n\n\nfunctions--a nonlinear function of peg number and a linear function of\n\n\ntrajectory length.\n\n\nTask times as a function of peg are illustrated in Figure 10 for\n\n\nseveral situations.\n\nShown are data from the 400-mm trajectories performed\n\n\nwith \xc2\xa3he MA-ll and MA-23 taken from this experiment and data from McGovern.\n\n\n(406 mm trajectories) using the Ames Arm and the unaided human hand.\nsame set of pegs was used in each experiment.\n\nThe\n\n\n\nNearly identical functions\n\n\n\nwere obtained under the two force feedback and the two no force feedback\n\n\nconditions, although different manipulators and test subjects were used.\n\n\nTwo functions explain the results of all the manipulators:\n\none for force\n\n\n\nfeedback (fl, from Equation I, and ff from Equation 2), the other for no\n\n\nforce feedback (fl from Equation 3).\n\nIt thus appears that the task time\n\n\n\ncan be predicted from the geometry of the task (peg number) and the\n\n\npresence or absence of force feedback.\n\n\nTask times as a function of trajectory length are shown in Figure\n\n\n11.\n\nThe linearity of the results as well as the similarity of the two\n\n\n\nforce feedback conditions are obvious for the MA-i1 and MA-23 (no force\n\n\n\n83\n\nORIGINAL PAGE IS\nPOOR QUALITY\n\n2.0\nPEG 2\n\n5\n\nPEG14\n\nNO FORCE FEEDBACK\n\nNO FORCE
