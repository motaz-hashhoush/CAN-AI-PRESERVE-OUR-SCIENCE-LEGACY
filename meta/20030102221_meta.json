The Solar Ozone Limb Sounding Experiment II (SOLSE2) instrument had a similar requirement of rotating a visible (VIS) or ultraviolet (W) filter into the instrument optical path. Both GLAS and SOLSE2 had similar operational and survival environments and lifetime requirements. A novel, precision rotational latching mechanism was designed to fulfill the needs of both missions. The GLAS instrument had driving stability and repeatability requirements, such that if the mechanism met these stringent requirements, it would more than surpass the required performance for the SOLSE2 mechanism. The resulting mechanism, referred to as a 'select mechanism' since it allows selection between 2 positions, was successfully designed and implemented for both missions.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"country": "Spain", "submissionId": 20030102221, "endDate": "2003-09-25T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "10th ESMATS International Mechanisms Symposium", "location": "San Sebastian,", "id": "6fb7f8c785ec414b9bde9d5b9de83623", "startDate": "2003-09-23T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20030102221, "id": "4493f801ad2649b6b0ce5241d6c8fcbd", "publicationDate": "2003-06-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
