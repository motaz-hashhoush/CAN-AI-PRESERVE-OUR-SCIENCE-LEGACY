The LD controls are variable-frequency drive controls designed to be adjustable for very slow and very-short-distance movements throughout the installation. The LD has a lift beam with an electric actuator attached at the end. The actuator attaches to a rectangular strong back (cradle) for lifting the long wall panels and short door panels from a lower angle into the vertical position inside the chamber, and then rotating around the chamber for installation onto the existing ceiling and floor. The LD rotates 360 (in very small increments) in both clockwise and counterclockwise directions. Eight lifting pads are on the top ring with 2-in. (.5-cm) eye holes spaced evenly around the ring to allow for the device to be suspended by three crane hoists from the top of the chamber. The LD is operated by remote controls that allow for a single, slow mode for booming the load in and out, with slow and very slow modes for rotating the load.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 20130009382, "id": "1cb70e25b8dd4ca8a24c829a57222b27", "publicationName": "NASA Tech Briefs, December 2012", "publicationDate": "2012-12-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 20130009376, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "NASA Tech Briefs, December 2012", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20130009382.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20130009382/downloads/20130009382.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20130009382/downloads/20130009382.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20130009382/downloads/20130009382.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
