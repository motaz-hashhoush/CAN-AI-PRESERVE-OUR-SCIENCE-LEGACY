Nominal dimensions of the titanium Ti-6-4 adherends were 0.13 x 2.5 x 12.7 cm and an overlap of 2.5 cm was used. The joint was bonded with FM-300 structural adhesive. The average ultimate shear strength of the gaged specimens and control specimens was 16.1 MPa and 14.1 MPa. A significant advantage of the proposed method is that strains internal to the joint are measured, rather than strains at an external edge. The presence of the gage was found to be not detrimental to bond performance.", "title": "Strain measurement within a single-lap joint using embedded strain gages", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-12T02:56:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19840054421, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Tuttle, M.
