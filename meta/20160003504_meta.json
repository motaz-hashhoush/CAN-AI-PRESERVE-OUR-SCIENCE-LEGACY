It defines the specific provisions required to design a battery that is safe for ground personnel and crew members to handle and/or operate during all applicable phases of crewed missions, safe for use in the enclosed environment of a crewed space vehicle, and safe for use in launch vehicles, as well as in unpressurized spaces adjacent to the habitable portion of a space vehicle. The required provisions encompass hazard controls, design evaluation, and verification. The extent of the hazard controls and verification required depends on the applicability and credibility of the hazard to the specific battery design and applicable missions under review. Evaluation of the design and verification program results shall be completed prior to certification for flight and ground operations. This requirements document is geared toward the designers of battery systems to be used in crewed vehicles, crew equipment, crew suits, or batteries to be used in crewed vehicle systems and payloads (or experiments). This requirements document also applies to ground handling and testing of flight batteries. Specific design and verification requirements for a battery are dependent upon the battery chemistry, capacity, complexity, charging, environment, and application. The variety of battery chemistries available, combined with the variety of battery-powered applications, results in each battery application having specific, unique requirements pertinent to the specific battery application. However, there are basic requirements for all battery designs and applications, which are listed in section 4. Section 5 includes a description of hazards and controls and also includes requirements.", "title": "Crewed Space Vehicle Battery Safety Requirements", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2016-03-16T15:51:43.8770000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20160003504, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Jeevarajan, Judith A."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Johnson Space Center", "location": "Houston, TX, United States"}}, "id": "3ab8d178d633403682a535db780f3703"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 20160003504, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Darcy, Eric C."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Johnson Space Center", "location": "Houston, TX, United States"}}, "id": "cac1b43fc527437ca489f00a4639b520"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "id": 20160003504, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20160003504, "id": "19995e04f1694dd0a99c790a9746ff2c", "publicationDate": "2014-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20160003504.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20160003504/downloads/20160003504.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20160003504/downloads/20160003504.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20160003504/downloads/20160003504.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
