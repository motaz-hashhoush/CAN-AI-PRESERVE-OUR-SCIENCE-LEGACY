Spaceship Earth is a new science curriculum which we developed\nto help\nstudents and teachers to explore the Earth, to see it in the global perspective,\nand to understand\nthe\nrelationships\namong life, the planet and the sun. We use astronaut photographs,\nwell as groundbased\nstudies to help students to understand\nglobal Earth Science\nof physical, life and social science.\n\nespecially shuttle pictures, as\nand integrate\nvarious aspects\n\nThe Spaceship\nEarth curriculum was developed at by a team of JSC scientists working in collaboration\nwith teachers from local school districts. The project was done under the auspices of Partners-In-Space,\na local\nnon-profit\norganization\ndedicated\nto improving science education and our general knowledge of space. The\nteam met once a month for a year then assembled the curriculum during the summer. The project is now in the\ntesting stage as the teachers try it out in their classrooms.\nIt has been supported by the Texas Education\nAgency and will be offered by the State of Texas as a supplemental\ncurriculum for statewide use. Because the\ncurriculum\nwas developed\nby teachers, it is self contained and the lessons are easy to implement\nand give\nstudents concrete experiences.\nThe three sub-units follow in a logical order, but may be used independently.\nthey are used separately,\nthey may be tied together by the teacher returning to the basic theme of the global\nEarth as each unit is completed.\nCurriculum\n\nIf\n\nOverview\n\nSearch\n\nfor a Habitable\n\nsystem. The students become\ndefining the life requirements\n\nPlanet. The introductory\n\nunit focuses\n\non the uniqueness\n\nof Earth in our solar\n\nextraterrestrial explorers on a mission to search for a new home. They begin by\nof different types of creatures.\nStudents are divided into six groups of creatures\n\nhaving different life requirements.\nAfter creating models of their creatures,\nthey tour our solar system looking\nfor planets that provide the needs of their creatures. They conclude that different planets are appropriate for\ndifferent types of creatures,\nbut that Earth is the only one that meets our needs.\nBlue Planet. The main unit focuses on Earth and the connections\nbetween life, the planet, and the sun.\nIt is divided into three distinct parts:\n1. Life Support System - Water and Air. The importance\nof water and air to the inhabitants\nof Earth\nis explored\nthrough exercises about water distribution, air composition, the effects of greenhouse\ngases, ozone\ndepletion\nand pollution.\nStudents will learn the effects of human intervention\non the water and air that sustain\nlife.\n2. Dynamic Earth.\nEarth is active and volatile. Energy from the Sun produces weather from the\natmosphere\nand oceans. Energy from inside the Earth produces new crust while it consumes old crust.\nExercises show the effects of these powerful internal and external forces on Earth's surface and its inhabitants.\n3. Living in the Environment.\nStudents will learn about the problems of living in extreme\nenvironments\nand plan an expedition to Antarctica\nto collect meteorites. They will evaluate requirements\nfor\nclothing, shelter, food, water, transportation,\ncommunication\nand recreation.\nThcy will rcalizc that living at\nEarth's last frontier is challenging,\nbut not out-of-this-world.\nMoon, Our Nearest Neighbor.\nThe final unit\nEarth. Students learn about our Moon as they plan to\nthis lifeless planetary body contrast strongly with their\nreinforces\nthe uniqueness of Earth and its life support\n\nconcludes the Spaceship Earth curriculum\nby lcaving\nset up a Moon base. Their plans to mect lifc's nccds on\nplans for an Antarctic expedition. This contrast\nsystem.\n\n879\n\n\xc2\xa2,\n\n"
