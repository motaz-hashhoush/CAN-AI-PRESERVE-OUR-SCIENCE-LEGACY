Imagery has been inspected\nfor a wide range of climatic and topographic environments in\nthe United States and in all areas influences of the vegetation\nupon radar returns were observable. There is sufficient information obtainable from this form of imagery t o warrant its investigation both for use a s a single sensor and for future use\nwith other remote sensors,\nThis paper presents vegetation maps prepared from radar\nimagery obtained over several climatic environments. The maps\nand imagery have been compared with each other to determine\nthe types of information extractable, and, where possible, conventional vegetation maps have been employed t o aid in the\ncomparison. Emphasis has been placed on the K band and\nAN/APQ-56 radar systems.\n\n-\n\nResults indicate that it is normally possible, by means\nof tonal and textural comparisons combined with basic geographic\nknowledge of the study area, to: 1) prepare regional or reconnaissance vegetation maps either on the basis of physiognomy or\nvegetation "type"; 2) delimit vegetation zones a s they vary with\nelevation: 3) trace burn patterns of previous forest fires: 4) delimit\naltitudinal timber line: and 5) identify species from inference\nin areas characterized by near monospecific stands. I t is anticipated that radar will have a role in the preparation of physiognomic\nand vegetation "type" maps particularly in inaccessible or\nunstudied areas,\n\n* This study was supported by the National Aeronautics and\nSpace Administration under contract NSR 17-004-003.\n\n1\n\nI. INTRODUCTION\nOne of the most pressing needs in the scientific study of extensive, poorly known tracts\nin remote desert, mountain, tropical savannah, and arctic latitudes, is the provision of reconnaissance and semi-detailed vegetation maps. In many such areas it is still true that our understanding of the distribution of major plant communities is pieced together from a very few detailed\nstudies in small areas. Wide areas are spliced with inferences from data of questionable reliability. In some areas indeed investigations a t the turn of the century constitute the basic data\nsource ,\nThe aim of the present paper is to comment on some of the problems and possibilities of\nvegetation analysis on radar imagery for the production of reconnaissance vegetation maps t o meet\nthis need and t o explore some future possibilities for quantifying vegetation analysis and for increasing our ability t o distinguish between regional vegetation types.\nModern side-looking radar systems are capable of imaging up t o 70 ,000 square m i l e s of\nterritory in a single day with resolutions comparable t o that in the illustrations accompanying this\npaper, Because of its exceedingly rapid data-collection rate, large areal coverage, and small\nscale of presentation, radar imagery is a powerful generalizing tool for studies of natural landscape features, These advantages , allied with the virtually all-weather capability of radar make\nit aunique tool for rapid data acquisition in remote areas, The all weather capability is of\npotentially great value in areas of extensive cloud cover or haze during critical plenologic periods\nwhen discrimination of communities is likely t o be easiest. In cloudy mountains , and in arctic\nlatitudes where ubiquitous stratiform cloud-decks impede summer-time photography and in tropical\nregions where various mixes of cumuliform and stratiform clouds, moisture haze and so on occur,\nradar\'s all-weather ability is a matter of some importance.\nA number of studies have indicated the value of radar in reconnaissance and regional\ngeologic mapping (Cameron 1965, Beatty e t a1 1965 , Pierson, Scheps and Simonett, 1965). However, little has been done with vegetation and we hope that this paper will interest plant ecologists\nand plant geographers t o explore the potential of radar for vegetation studies.\n\nThis study is sponsored by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (contract\nNSR 17-004-003) with a view t o evaluating the utility of radar a s a tool for geoscience research\non orbiting spacecraft.\n2.\n\nLITERATURE SURVEY\n\nTo our knowledge the only unclassified studies of vegetation analysis with radar imagery\nare those by Beatty e t a1 (1965) and Simonett and Morain (1965). Both of these studies were made\nwith single frequency "brute force\'\' mono-polarization radars used monoscopically The radars\nwere the Ka band AN/APQ-56 system and the X-band AN/APQ-69 system. Non-imaging radar\nstudies of vegetation employing a scatterometer for measuring radar backscatter per unit area a s\na function of viewing angle (Oo VS e) are those by Reitz, E.A. (1959) Cosgriff, Peake and Taylor\n(1960), and Moore, Janza and Warner (1959). In addition t o being studies with a non-imaging\ndevice , these radar reflection studies have concerned themselves mostly with reflections from\nsmall areas in fields rather than from natural vegetation (Cosgriff, Peake and Taylor 1960), from\nvery broad categories of natural vegetation (Moore, Janza and Warner, 1959), or with a mixture\nof cultivated and natural vegetation (Reitz, E .A. , et. al. , 1959).\n\n.\n\nThe study reported on here is an attempt to carry some of the ideas and conclusions in\nthese five papers a little further, particularly in regard t o the sensing of natural vegetation. A\ncompanion study dealing with cultivated crops is also underway a t the University of Kansas in\nconjunction with Dr. Andrew Erhart of the Garden City Agricultural Experiment Station in western\nKansas.\n3 . METHODS FOR THE ANALYSIS OF VEGETATION\nWITH RADAR IMAGERY\nIn the discrimination of plant communities on radar imagery there are a number of methods\nwhich aid separation: 1) differences in average gray scale values between communities,\n2) probability density functions per unit area derived from f i l m both for area-extensive discrete\nobjects and for aggregates of objects , 3) discrimination of textural differences , 4) edge effects,\nespecially those which arise from different means of gradation from one plant community t o another\nin nature, and which may be handled through analysis of acutance on the image, 5) analysis of\n2\n\nspatial arrangements , based on a knowledge of the general distribution of plant communities in an\narea, 6) evaluating the context of associated objects, both internal t o a single community and\nexternal forms, 7) image transformations via optical means, including the one and two-dimensional\nFourier transform, 8) differentiation, 9) integration, 10) expansion of portions of the dynamic\nrange, and 11) level slicing. Items 8 through 11 a l s o lend themselves t o two-dimensional multicolor presentations involving u s e of the luminance and two chrominance channels in a color television system, and photographic color methods, These do not exhaust the possibilities.\nA l l the above are concerned with single images. However , simultaneously recorded\nimagery giving the full polarization matrix and/or two or more frequencies is now becoming available and data of this type is potentially suitable for certain additional types of analysis including:\n1) polychromatic display techniques involving television and multiple flying spot scanners and\nphotographic color methods, and 2) derivation of sums of differences of signals in both onedimensional and two-dimensional form.\n\nFinally, there is the possibility of using time a s a discriminant tool t o improve identification through variations in all the above types of data a t different stages of the growth cycle of\nplant communities,\n\n4 . SOME METHODS USED IN THIS STUDY FOR ANALYSIS OF VEGETATION\nIt is intended that experiments in the above forms of image processing and analysis be\nmade at the University of Kansas for the study of vegetation. We are however still in the early\nstages of evaluation and only a few of these possible techniques were used in this paper,\nThree of these techniques will be unfamiliar t o most ecologists and plant geographers, so\nthat it is appropriate t o briefly review them here. They are: 1) use of simultaneously obtained\nmultiple polarization radar images, 2) radar image texture variations and 3) probability density\nfunctions of each plant (structural) community.\n4 . 1 MULTIPLE POLARIZATION RADAR IMAGES\n\nIn studying the effect of polarization of radar return signals from vegetation, two c a s e s\nmust be considered: first the radar return as a function of the polarity of the transmitted signal\nalone, and second, the radar return as a function both of the polarity of the transmitted signal\nand the depolarizing properties of the terrain. These two phenomena may be conveniently\nseparated by the u s e of radar imaging systems which record the full polarization matrix and, when\ntransmitting signals of one linear polarization, receive signals with both direct and orthogonal\npolarizations. A number of such systems are in operation and images are being studied for\npolarization interaction with natural and cultivated vegetation.\nThe first c a s e applies when terrain depolarization of the back-scattered signal is slight\nand where the return signal is high for one linear polarization and low for another. This situation\nthus applies when the horizontally polarized signal both transmitted and received (which we may\ndesignate HH) is compared t o the vertically polarized signal transmitted and received (W)\n\n.\n\nThe second case applies when terrain depolarization of a transmitted signal is sufficient\nfor recording on f i l m . Analysis may then be made of the relative depolarization produced by\ndifferent vegetation types, by comparing the W or HH image with the appropriate cross polarized\nimage (horizontally transmitted, vertically received, designated a s HV; and the equivalent for\nvertical transmission, designated VH) In this paper all the comparisons available are of the\nsecond type between HH and HV images only.\n\n.\n\nThe cross polarized return is normally down about 10 db from the l i k e signal and the gain\non the cross channel receiver may be adjusted to give like and cross images (HH and HV) of\ncomparable gray scale intensity. Since the system is not calibrated the images cannot be used\nquantitatively, but they are appropriate for qualitative comparisons of differences.\n4 . 2 IMAGE TEXTURE ANALYSIS\n\nVariations in image texture are also significant in helping t o discriminate between classes\nof natural vegetation. Beatty et a1 (1965) have studied such texture variations a s are shown on\nthe AN/APQ-56 imaging radar, (a Ka-band "brute force ," side looking system) in the Front Range\nand High Plains of Colorado and other areas and concluded that a judicious but rather limited use\nof textural differences would help in regional vegetation mapping with the AN/APQ-56 radar.\n3\n\nThe "texture" apparent on a radar image of vegetated areas is composed of two separate\ncomponents, namely a system component and a true vegetation component. The system component\narises from the number of pulses averaged per resolution element. This may range from a few t o\nseveral hundred, depending on the system. The more pulses averaged, the greater the probability\nof achieving a relatively uniform gray scale for a given essentially homogeneous area. However\nwhen very few pulses are averaged, a s in the case in much synthetic aperture radar imaging, the\nwider is the spread of gray scale values per unit resolution cell and the "grainier" the image\nappears on an enlargement,\nA l l radar systems have some residual system texture a s described above and this is true\neven over near-specular reflectors. This residual or inherent texture arises from variations in the\naverage return per unit resolution cell, over essentially homogeneous terrain in which roughness is\nmeasured on a micro scale.\n\nTextures coarser than this residual or system component may reasonably be expected t o\nreflect in part real differences in meso and macro terrain roughness characteristics (including\nshadowing) t o which the radar is sensitive.\nEven casual inspection of radar imagery suggests that a three or five category texture\nclassification (for a given radar system) from "very fine" t o "very coarse" could be used with\ncomparative reference masks, However each system differs from all others a s a function of the\nradar wavelength, ground resolution, and viewing angle used, For our purposes here we have\nfollowed a semiquantitative 5-category texture range. A considerable amount of additional work\nis necessary t o evaluate and derive wantitative measures of texture, It is our intention t o continue a study of texture variations with different frequencies and systems, and it is our understanding that Beatty and others in Autometrics Corporation are also working in this area.\n4 . 3 PROBABILITY DENSITY FUNCTIONS OF VEGETATION TYPES\n\nProbability density functions derived from radar imagery represent the third method used in\nthis study which has potentially wide application in the study of vegetation. These functions were\ndeveloped by scanning 5 f i l m ositive enlargements of HH and HV images, The ground area\nX\nscanned was roughly .75 t o Km or about 1 square inch on film. The flying spot scanner used was\ncoupled t o a pulse height analyzer, Scanning was at the rate of 7,000 pulses per second for 10\nseconds in all c a s e s , s o the peak amplitudes are comparable. The X axis is a plot of intensity,\nderived by measuring f i l m transmittance (radar return energy increases left t o right on the illustrations), and the Y axis gives the frequency of occurrence of given f i l m transmittances (or return\nenergies). We employed 175 channels t o encompass the full dynamic range on the radar image f i l m .\n\n5\n\nThe curves produced with this system define the probability distribution (and hence the\nin this c a s e\nvariances) of given energy levels for apparently uniform classes of natural terrain\nstructural vegetation types. Many of the curves are essentially gaussian and range from narrow t o\nbroad. Some are decidedly skewed, some are bimodal, others seem almost t o follow a Raleigh\ndistribution function, Finally the average gray scale values differ somewhat between vegetation\ntypes. Potentially, therefore, the curves would appear t o lend themselves t o both quantitative and\nnominative classification a s another means of discrimination between vegetation classes.\n\n--\n\nThe curves illustrated later in this paper suggest t o us that certain distinctive vegetation\nmosaics or types in tropical savannahs, savannah woodlands, thorn woodlands etc. may have\nrelatively unique bimodal or even trimodal probability density distributions, arising from the\nspatial distribution of the various life forms in the community. When radar imagery is obtained of\nsuch tropical areas it will be appropriate t o test this hypothesis, It will be recognized a l s o that\nthe probability density function for vegetation communities is itself conditioned by the resolution,\nfrequency and type (real aperture or synthetic aperture) of the radar system employed and the\nnaturally-occuring distributions of maj or and minor reflecting elements in the landscape. Even\nmodest resolutions are likely t o be of considerable value because many of the natural spatial\nperiodicities t o be sampled (detected) are larger than the resolution net being used. However,\nhigh resolution radar systems promise t o give considerably more data on communities with fine\nspatial periodicities , and will need t o be studied in detail. To what extent there are families of\nprobability density functions for a given vegetation type (related t o differences in radar resolutions)\nand where the critical resolution l i m i t s lie are all matters for future investigation.\n5. SOME ANALYSES OF RADAR IMAGERY\n\nExamples illustrating the potential use of radar imagery for interpreting vegetation patterns\nand conditions are presented for three areas representative of relatively poorly known arid,\nmountain and arctic environments. These are in the s e m i arid zone of southwestern Utah, the\n4\n\nrelatively densely vegetated mountains of central Oregon and the permafrost zone of interior\nAlaska. From these illustrations we hope t o highlight some of the present means of extracting\nvegetation information from imagery.\nEscalante Valley, Utah lies in the semi-arid Great Basin and is dominated by large tracts\nof uniformly low, and often sparse, shrubby vegetation. This area was selected for study because\nrecently acquired K band imagery for a number of basins in the semi-arid west show similar\npatterns of radar return which are of possible vegetation origin. Reconnaissance field investigations have been carried out in this area and comparison of radar imagery with actual vegetation\nconditions confirms the influence of vegetation on radar returns.\n\n-\n\nHorsefly Mountain, east of Klamath Falls, Oregon, lies i n the transition region between\nGreat Basin vegetation similar t o that in Escalante Valley and more mesic conifer forests of the\nPacific Coast. The great contrast in physiognomy between vegetation types in this area makes it\nuseful for evaluating image texture patterns for different stages of forest growth. Field studies\nare planned for this site from which we hope t o extend our interpretations of image texture t o\nother areas.\nYukon Flats, Alaska is included a s an example of the potential of radar in vegetation\nanalysis because studies have already shown the ability of radar t o detect burn patterns in areas\nburned as long ago a s about 1940. Fire is recognized as one of the all important influences on\nvegetation patterns in numerous environments ranging from the tropics t o the high latitudes: thus\nthe use of radar a s a remote sensor of this phenomenon may help t o solve many unanswered\nquestions regarding the rate and possibly the direction of succession after fire, aside from being\nof more immediate practical utility for foresters interested in forest regrowth.\n5.1 ESCALANTE VALLEY, UTAH\n\nEscalante Valley in southwestern Utah is flanked by the rugged Mineral Mountains on the\ne a s t and the Star Range on the west. Coarse textured pebbly alluvial fans issue from the canyons\nof these mountains and grade gradually into finer textured soils toward the floor of the valley near\nMilford. In general, vegetation types are closely tied t o conditions of soil texture, salinity, and\ndepth, in such a manner that distinct elevational zones may be recognized.\nSagebrush (Artemisia tridentata) occurs in nearly monospecific zones on alluvial fans.\nLocally it may contain patches of little rabbit brush (Crysothamnus lanata) , but generally the\nsagebrush zone has been largely stripped o other species by grazing. A zone of shadscale shrub\nf\n(Artiplex confertifolia) becomes dominant on the finer textured soils in the lower parts of the valley,\nand there is often a very narrow transition zone between these two types. In the lowest, and\noften saltiest areas, shrub species may disappear altogether i n favor of saltgrass and pickleweed.\nIn addition t o the species mentioned there are only a few other important woody or herbacems\nshrubs characteristic of Escalante Valley, and none of these occupy recognizable zones,\nEven though species are segregated into zones, vegetation throughout is quite uniform in\nheight (< 1 m) and species tend t o be quite similar in geometry. Shrubs are small and intricately\nbranched, with small leaves ranging in size from a few mm t o one or two c m . Shrubs tend to be\nround with the main branches more or less erect. They are irregularly deciduous and widely\nspaced, rarely forming stands of greater than 60% cover. Dead bushes, of which there are many,\noften remain intact, and are sometimes difficult t o distinguish from live bushes in a deciduous\nphase.\nRadar imagery of the Milford area (fig. 1) was obtained October 19, 1965 with a multipolarization radar system. Weather conditions for the week immediately prior t o the overflight\nwere near normal with an average daytime temperature of ca. 190 C and a total of ,75 mm preciRitation. There was, however, no precipitation for three days prior to the flight (Climatological\nData, Utah, Oct. 1965, Vol. 67 # 10).\nA tentative vegetation map (fig. 2A) was prepared from inspection of both the HH and H\nV\npolarized images of Escalante Valley. A t the t i m e this map was prepared it was not known\ndefinitely whether radar returns represented vegetation patterns, surface material patterns, or salt\npatterns: consequently, it illustrates f i l m density categories t o which probable vegetation types\nwere assigned that are consistent with known Basin and Range vegetation. In an effort t o trace\non the ground the density categories extracted from the imagery, a field check was conducted in\nlate January and early February, 1966. A second map (fig, 2B) shows the results of this\ninvestigation.\n\n5\n\na)\n\nc\nS\n\nU\nU\n\nx\n\nW\n\ncc\n\n0\n\nal\n>\n..c\n\n8\n\nP\n\n6\n\nr\n0\n\n.\n\nh\n\nm\n\nW\n\n5\ne\n\n9\n-\n\nf\n\ny\n.\n\nO\n\nx\n...c\nS\nV\n\n>\nal\n\nE\nL\n\n9\n2\nal\n\nu)\n\nU\n\nE\n.-\n\n5\n\nU\n\ne\n\nW\n\n6\n\nm\nI\n\nY\n\nE\n\n2\n\nLc\n\nU\n\n>\n.al\n\nL\n\nal\nW\n\n8\n0\nE\n\n.S\n\n0\n\nc\nO\nc\n\nal\n\n0)\n\n>"\n(\nu\n\n2\n\n.3\n\n0)\n\nL\n\n7\n\nFig. 2A and 2B are generally comparable except for the category originally interpreted a s\nshrub transition in the laboratory analysis, The absence of this category in the field points up the\nfact that vegetation zones in this environment lack broad transitions, and suggests that somewhat\nmore latitude in f i l m density categories must be allowed in order t o accurately delimit zones. The\nsame may be said for areas which are bare or nearly bare of vegetation. These may yield a range\nof f i l m densities which are related t o variations in surface material roughness or moisture content.\nThus they may appear on the imagery a s either areas of high or low energy return.\nResults of the field investigation are outlined below which are of importance for interpreting\nthe imagery.\n1) Radar return patterns in Escalante Valley correspond primarily with vegetation patterns,\nbut, since the individual shrubs are widely spaced, the range of f i l m densities depends a l s o on\nthe roughness of surface alluvial material. On the higher portions of the alluvial fans, surface\nmaterials are gravelly and rough in relation t o the wavelength, resulting in increased scattering\nof radar signals and a higher proportion of return (light tones on a f i l m positive). However, toward\nf\nthe center o the valley the surface material becomes finer and the moisture content probably\nincreases, Both of these conditions would tend t o diminish return signals. In the sparsely grassed\nareas on the gravel fans northeast of Milford (see area J on fig, 1B) returns are extremely high.\nImmediately south of area J , sagebrush covers enough ground that radar returns are lowered in\ncomparison t o the adjacent gravel surface.\n2) Sharp boundaries in f i l m density are judged t o be due largely to vegetation changes,\nsince the mean s i z e of surface material particles decreases in a gradual manner from gravel a few\ncentimeters in diameter on the upper fans to clay loam and clay soils near the center of the valley.\nMinor variations in film density are attributed t o local changes in shrub density. Figure 3 shows\nA\na relatively clear area in the sagebrush zone on the west side of Milford. On the imagery this\narea (fig. 1B-A) has slightly lower f i l m density (lighter gray) than the surrounding denser sagebrush\ntype (darker gray) Studies in western Kansas agricultural lands have repeatedly demonstrated the\nsame phenomenon: the radar return is markedly influenced by the density or percentage of ground\ncover by vegetation. In reconnaissance type mapping it is not always practical t o delimit these\nminor occurrences. Indeed, doing so could be misleading because not all areas of similar f i l m\ndensity would necessarily be equivalent vegetationally or texturally. Moreover, a strictly laboratory interpretation would give no basis for such a fine distinction. Fig. 3B was taken near site\nE on fig. 1, and illustrates a more typical aspect of the sagebrush zone near Milford.\n\n.\n\n3) Vegetation height seems to be of secondary importance in influencing radar returns\nbecause of the overriding influences of shrub density and the coarsness of surface gravels. Where\nvariations in height are accompanied by changes in life form, however, a s in the grass meadow\nat site H , there may be significant influence on the return signal. More studies are needed t o\nevaluate the relationship between shrub height and density in semi-arid environments, as the\nresults may be equally applicable in other areas of predominantly shrub vegetation, viz a viz\narctic and alpine tundras.\n4) A s is evident from the imagery, the absence of distinct variations in image texture\nmakes separation of vegetation zones difficult. Visual interpretation rests solely on f i l m density\npatterns, which may vary considerably for some vegetation types depending upon the nature of the\nunderlying surface material. Development of techniques for statistically analyzing images may\nimprove our "eyesight" immeasurably and eventually permit us t o separate less distinct vegetation\ntypes.\n\n5) Comparison of radar imagery with conventional panchromatic aerial photography reduced\nto an equivalent scale (fig, 4) demonstrates one of the chief advantages of radar as a remote\nsensor of vegetation: that is, the ability of radar t o generalize over large areas and reduce\nunnecessary detail. While detail is abundant on aerial photography, there is little evidence of\nvegetation zonation.\n\nProbability density curves are illustrated for several vegetation types in Escalante Valley\n(fig, 5). These curves were generated by scanning areas 1" x 3/4" on 5X enlargements of HH and\nH positive transparencies (ground dimension approximately .8 x 1,2 km) , With the exception of\nV\nareas D and H (see fig, 1) all areas had more or less uniform f i l m densities. Nevertheless, the\npresence of several peaks on most of the curves suggest that the areas have non-homogeneous\nsurfaces,\nCurves for areas A, B, and C represent sagebrush with almost no grass understory on a\npebble surface. Each curve has a broad peak in the medium intensity region flanked by a narrower\nand laver bimodal region of lower intensity t o the left. Area D, which represents bare land with\nseveral pockets of sagebrush has a similar appearance, but the curve for the H image in particular\nV\n8\n\n5\nal\n\nc\nS\n\nP,\n\ncn\n\n- .0\n\nD E\n\n0\n\n51\nw\nrc\n\nL\n\n0\n-0\n\n2\n\n0 v\n\n0\n\n5\n.- t\nP,\n\n0\n\n0\nP\n\n3\n\n0\nv c\n0\n\n-0\nal\n0\n3\n-0\nal\nL\n\n0\n0\n\nc\n\nI\n\nI\n:\n\nu\n\n5\n\ncc\n0\n\n.\n\nc\nY)\n\nx\n\n9\n\nE8\n\n3\nal\n\nc\n\nA\nP,\n\nLL\n\nI\n:\n0\n\n5\n\n2\n\nu\n\nc\n\nc\n\n0\n\nP\n\n1,\n\nLL\n\nal\n\ncn\n.-\n\ncc\n0\nc\n\n8\n\n5t-\n\n2\nn\n\nLL\n\nal\n\nc\n\nS\n\n0\n\n-w\n.- 51\n0\n\nal\n\nm\n\n0\n\nu,\n\n0\nQ\nx\nI\n-\n\nrc\n\n0\n\nc\nV\n\na,\n\n8\n\n6\n\nh\n\nm\n\nv\nh\n\n4\n\n9\n\nm\nal\nL\n3\n\nD\n\n0\n\nI\n\ny\n.\n\nc\n\n0\n\nC\n\n0\n\n.C\n\nF\n.-\n\nI\n\n10\n\nshows an increase in breadth and height for the middle peak and a decrease in height for the right\nhand peak. If we assume that each peak represents a different phenomenon on the ground, the\n.middle peak may represent the return energy from bare ground. The small, low intensity peak on\nthe left may represent return energy from features such as drainage ways or minor slope variations.\nAll of these assumptions bear the burden of proof, however, and this can be gained only through\nintensive field work in small areas.\nAreas E , F , and G lie largely in the vegetation zone dominated by shadscale and fine textured soils. Area E however consists of a compact mosaic of other species such a s greasewood and\nlittle rabbit brush, and area G contains patches of saltgrass. A l l of these curves have a single\nsharp peak in the medium intensity region with one or two small appendage peaks on the left flank.\nMinor variations in the shapes of the curves are observable which further study may show relate t o\ndifferences in terrain processes.\nIn a properly calibrated imaging system (the radar system used was not calibrated) it should\nbe possible t o combine (subtract or add) information contained in the HH and HV curves and t o\ncorrect for differences in db between them, giving a resultant curve which could be read, for\nexample, t o test whether the shadscale-greasewood-little rabbit brush mosaic of area E could be\ndistinguished from the purely shadscale type of area F.\nCurves for area H are puzzling because they do not agree with the visual impression of f i l m\ndensity variations within the outlined area, One would expect a single peak in the low intensity\nregion, one i n the medium t o high intensity region, and a broad curve connecting these two throughout the middle intensity region, Consequently, the occurrence of a curve similar t o those for\nshadscale types is surprising and we intend t o pursue this problem further.\nIn summary, radar imagery, combined with analytical interpretation techniques, may serve\na s a reliable tool for intermediate scale mapping of already recognized vegetation zones in the semiarid part of the United States, and may thus be of significant value for ecologists, botanists, and\nrange managers interested in knowing actual distributions of grassland, shrub land and grazing\ndensity of stands. Because the vegetation is uniform, however, there is relatively little opportunity\nfor utilizing "edge effects\'\' and image texture patterns as interpretation aids Physiognomically\ndiverse areas such a s that illustrated for south-central Oregon, which we may now study, are most\namenable t o utilizing these techniques,\n\n.\n\n5.2\n\nHORSEFLY MOUNTAIN, SOUTH-CENTRAL OREGON\n\nV\nFigure 6 illustrates K - band HH and H polarized images obtained in October, 1965 for\nthe vicinity of Horsefly Mountain in south-central Oregon. This region is characterize\'? by a coarse\nmosaic of pine forest with low lying shrub and grassland (Andrews and Cowlin, 1936; Kuchler, 1964).\nFigure 7 is a reproduction of Bly Quadrangle (USGS 1:62,500) showing the gross distribution of\nforest and non-forest areas, and figure 8 represents a tentative vegetation-type map prepared from\nthe radar imagery. Enlargements of the major image textures, which served a s the basis for\nsegregating types, are illustrated in figure 9, while probability density curves for five selected\nareas within some of these texture categories are presented in figure 10. Figure 8 has not yet\nbeen field checked for accurate identification of types because heavy snow blanketed the area just\na s we were t o begin field work. However, there is little doubt that the distribution of a t least the\nforest and non-forest areas is quite accurate if correction is made for system geometry, The area\nwill be studied in the summer of 1966.\nDetails of forest distribution on the HV image compare favorably with shaded areas on the\ntopographic map, while regions of low energy return (dark gray on the f i l m positives) on the HH\nimage correlate remarkably well with those designated a s marsh lands. Areas denoted a s shrub on\nthe topographic map (stippled pattern) have a variety of textures on the imagery, and some regions\nwhich are designated a s forest on the topographic map appear to fall more into the c l a s s of low\nforest or shrub on the imagery, a s does that below and t o the left of site E .

Differences in macro and micro\nroughness together with differences in dielectric properties between these major types may in part\nexplain $heir differing abilities t o depolarize radar signals.\nInspection of the H polarization (fig. 6B) shows that the returns from sagebrush are\nV\nnotably lower than in the HH image (fig. 6A). Because of this the relative contrast between sagebrush and adjacent coniferous forest and grassland is magnified in the H image. We suspect\nV\nthat leaf orientation and leaf length in both conifer and grassland make these targets rougher on a\nmicro scale than the sagebrush, and hence the latter depolarizes the transmitted signal t o a\nlesser extent. Of course differences in dielectric properties between these vegetation types may\na l s o contribute t o the observed differences\nThe overall appearance of the two radar images suggests that reconnaissance vegetation\nmaps of scales ranging between 1: 1 0 0 , 0 0 0 and 1: 62,500 could be prepared by utilizing the visual\naspects of f i l m density and image texture. More sophisticated interpretation techniques combined\nwith data collected simultaneously from other sensors may further enable more precise separations\nby type of vegetation.\nThe enlargements of image texture in figure 9 can be grouped into forest and non-forest\ncategories. This distinction is readily apparent on the basis of coarseness and contrast between\npoints of high, medium and low energy return, The texture for well developed forest (D) has a wide\nspread of values from high through medium t o low intensities, and also a notably coarse texture.\nTrees in t h i s category have been described a s conifers 150 to 200 feet high covering more than 80%\nof the ground (Andrews and Cowlin, 1936). Although it has not been confirmed from field studies,\nit is possible that the observed coarse image texture and marked variations in signal level result\nfrom a high gross roughness envelope and many large reflectors such a s tree trunks in the forest\ncombined with areas of no or little return arising from partial shadowing, The coarseness of the\npattern and the relatively small proportion of medium intensity suggests that returns are coming\nfrom groups of trees and that little of the transmitted signal is reaching ground level.\nThe texture for well developed forest may be compared t o that for a probable young forest\nof forest-shrub transition (E), This type h a s a similar but finer image texture possibly arising\nfrom shorter trees. The noticeable decrease in the proportion of no or little return areas indicates\na decrease of radar shadowing, while the increase in medium return energy may result from a\nhigher proportion of the signal reaching ground level.\nImage texture ,patterns for non-forest types (A, B, C) are notably finer in texture and much\nmore uniform in gray scale value (i.e, the variance around the mean value is less than for the\nforest types). Height ceases t o be a significant parameter in natural grass or shrub lands resulting\nin reduced contrast and an increase in the number of pulse lengths on the ground giving nearly the\nsame energy return.\nA s an example of possible future capabilities using a flying spot scanner coupled t o a\npulse height analyzer in studying forest environments, figure 10 illustrates probability density\ncurves for selected areas on the Oregon imagery corresponding t o the image textures in fig. 9.\nFive areas were selected for comparison which range in type from marsh t o forest passing through\nmajor transition types. Both the HH and H images were utilized and each area had a ground\nV\ndimension of 1 km by .75 km. Care was exercised t o maintain area homogeneity but forested areas\nin general present problems of radar shadowing because they are usually associated with more\ndissected and rugged topography.\nA s with the probability density curves presented for Escalante Valley, it is not yet\nappropriate t o a s s e s s the meaning of individual peaks and nulls for each of the Oregon curves.\nA few general points should be noted, however. Area B is composed primarily of medium t o high\nintensity returns from what is reported t o be dry prairie on the topographic map (fig. 7). If this\nhigh intensity is portrayed on the probability density curve by the rather broad and low peak in the\nhigh intensity portion of the curve, which seems reasonable, then the secondary peak observable\nin the lower intensity region may be correlated with low return marsh channels interfingering\nwith the prairie, While these comments are speculative at present, they indicate some of the\npotential rewards for continuing this method of analysis. In the initial stages of creating a\ncatalog of vegetation curves, however, it would be desirable t o minimize complexities arising\nfrom scanning more than one terrain phenomenon for a given area,\n\nPerhaps one of the more interesting features about the probability density curves lies in\ncomparing those for Escalante Valley and south-central Oregon. Here may be noted some degree\nof similarity between the general shape of curves for such types a s Oregon marsh and Utah\n\n14\n\nn\n\n8\n\n0\n.e\n\n1\n)\n\n.2\ne\n+\n\n3\n\nL\n\nf\nI\n\n1\n1\n\n2\n-5\nI\n\nh\n\n-5\nL\n.\n\nv)\n\ne\n\nD\n\nE\n\n$4:\n$1\n\nv\n\nv\n\nu\n\nt\n\nx\n.c\n\nv)\n\n8\n\na\n,\n\n.2\n.c\n\nS\n\n0"\n\nE\nV\n\n8\n\nc\nL.l\n\nE\n\n9\n\n15\n\nshadscale. Comparisons o this kind for all the curves presented illustrates the potential\nf\nimportance of secondary peaks and minor variations in the shapes of curves, since, despite their\nsimilarity, they contain notable and perhaps diagnostic differences of the sort which may be\nnecessa\'ry t o perform "type" separations.\n\n5.3 YUKON FLATS, ALASKA\nA s a last example of the potential value of radar imagery for studying vegetation patterns,\na portion of Yukon Flats, Alaska is illustrated. Imagery for this area (fig. 11) was obtained in\nOctober, 1957, through dense stratiform undercast by an AN/APQ-56 Ka band (8.6 mm) system\nhaving a resolution of about 30 meters and an image ground scale of about 1:350,000. Unlike\nimagery previously illustrated however, only one polarization was transmitted and received.\n\nThe tentative vegetation map (fig. 12) has not been field checked, but Dr. Philip\nJohnson of the U .S, Army Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratories has confirmed the\nmajor points of the interpretation from his experience in that part of Alaska. The interpretation\nincorporates criticisms by Dr. Johnson of an earlier map prepared by u s of this area. The physical\nsetting of this area has already been discussed in more detail elsewhere (Simonett and Morain, 1965).\nOn the negative imagery areas of low energy appear in part t o represent a previous fire\npattern a s evidenced by a n east-west lenticular interfingering of f i l m densities and their associated\nsawtooth edges. This interpretation is strengthened by the reported occurrence in 1940 of the Box\nCar Burn, which swept westward through this area from the Porcupine River t o the Christian River\nburning some 192,000 acres (Lutz, 1956). The evident north-south belted arrangement of f i l m\ndensities further suggests an occurrence of vegetation zones paralleling major drainage lines and\nupon which the burn pattern of 1940 may have been superimposed. Vegetation successional stages\nare not fully known for Arctic Alaska, but it is likely that willow, aspen, and some white birch\nare actively invading these burned areas.\n\n.\n\nAreas of high return (dark gray) have been interpreted a s white spruce (Picea glauca) This\nspecies tends t o form relatively dense and near monospecific stands in moist environments along\nnarrow flood plains and lake margins, but may a l s o exist as islands in fire burn, Regions of intermediate energy (medium gray) probably correspond t o open, dwarf forest of black spruce (Picea\nmariana) and white birch (Betula papyrifera) with an understory of ericaceous shrubs and mosses\n(Johnson, personal communication)\n\n.\n\nThe AN/APQ-56 imagery is poor in system performance in comparison t o that produced by\nmore recent systems. Image texture patterns are altogether absent in this study area, and f i l m\ndensity patterns are not well defined. Similar f i l m density patterns have been observed in other\nareas on this imagery, and, i n fact, some of the dense galeria forests north of Yukon Flats begin\nt o appear a s distinct image texture differences even on this dated imagery.\nProbability density functions were not prepared for the AN/APQ-56 imagery because of\nmarked side-lobing which seriously degrades this imagery. Furthermore the rationale for correcting\nvariations between radar systems themselves has not been outlined. Until this is done, there can\nbe no meaningful comparison of probability density curves from different systems.\n6. SUMMARY\n\nThe three regions discussed exemplify a very small range of vegetation types and conditions, but we hope the results of this discussion are sufficiently convincing t o stimulate continued\nstudies of vegetation with radar imagery. The information content obtained from long wavelength,\nactive sensors could serve a s a useful corollary t o information obtained from the visible, near I R ,\nand thermal IR regions because energy returns beyond the millimeter wavelength range are greatly\ninfluenced by factors of physiognomy. Escalante Valley, Horsefly Mountain, and Yukon Flats begin\nt o shed light on our understanding of some of these factors, but no doubt there are others of equal\nimportance t o be gleaned from yet unstudied environments. The ever growing body of radar theory\nprovides us with the basic where-with-all t o begin relevant quantitative assessment of geometric\nparameters. The theory is now beginning t o be supplemented with appropriate field data collected\nfor the radar interpreter. The next step is t o develop field and laboratory experiments designed t o\nevaluate specific parameters. A number of field experiments are underway in western Kansas on\nagricultural fields as a joint project of the University of Kansas and Kansas State University\nAgricultural Experiment Station: and at Purdue University a s a joint project of the Botany and\nAgriculture departments and the Ohio State University Antenna Laboratory. No experiments have\nyet been run on natural vegetation types. The results given in this paper clearly suggest that radar\nexperiments should be made on many natural vegetation types.\n16\n\nAN/APQ-56\n\nRadar negative imagery for a portion of Yukon Flats, Alaska\nFigure\n\n11\n\nsparse mixed and deciduous fo\n\nFigure\n\n12\n\nTentative vegetation types of Yukon Flats, Alaska\n(after Sirnonett and Morain, 1965)\n\nFEFERENCES\n\nf\nAndrews , H.
