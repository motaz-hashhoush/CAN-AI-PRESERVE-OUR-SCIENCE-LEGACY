One  of  the  primary  goals  is  to  extract  propellants  from  the  regolith  and  water  ice,  such  as  oxygen and  hydrogen  which  could  then  be  used  for  in-space transportation.  In  addition,  the  space  mining  system can  be  used  for  various  construction  tasks  that  can benefit human and robotic exploration as well as scientific investigations based on excavated exposed topography, such as the side walls of trenches. The  National  Aeronautics  &  Space  Administration  (NASA) \u201cLunabotics\u201d Robotic  Mining  Competition  (RMC)  is  a  university-level  competition  designed to  engage  and  retain  students  in  science,  technology,  engineering  and  mathematics  (STEM).  NASA has directly benefited from the competition by encouraging  the  development  of  innovative  lunar  excavation concepts from universities which has resulted in clever ideas and solutions which could be applied to an actual lunar excavation  device  or  payload.  The  challenge  is for students to design and build a remote controlled or autonomous 80 kg mass lightweight excavator, called a \u201clunabot\u201d, which can collect and deposit a minimum of 10  kilograms  of  lunar  simulant  within  15  minutes.    In recent  years  the  goal  has  been  changed  to  excavate  a minimum  of  1  kg  of  simulated  icy  regolith  which  is found  under  an  overburden  of  regolith  simulant.  The complexities   of   the   challenge   include   the   abrasive characteristics   of   the   lunar   regolith   simulant,   the weight and size limitations of the lunabot, and the ability  to  control  the  lunabot  from  a  remote mission control center or operate it autonomously. This presentation will summarize the  results of  the Lunabotics  Robotic  Mining  Competitions  held in May 2022.  Each year, since 2010, over 50 university  teams  have  attended,  resulting  in  over  500  lunabot designs and subsequent prototypes. Over 6,000 university students have  been part of the  on-site competition at  KSC,  and  many  are  employed  in the space  sector today with  thriving  careers. Even  more  students  and the  public  were  engaged via  internet  broadcasting  and social networking media.  Examples of how this translates  to  hiring  opportunities  for  commercial  sponsors will also be discussed. Overall, this competition has proven to be popular with multi-disciplinary university senior  design  classes  and  a  valuable tool  for  NASA and academia in educating and inspiring the  next generation of space engineers.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "cui": {"isCui": false}, "meetings": [{"country": "US", "submissionId": 20220005359, "endDate": "2022-06-10T04:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"organizationId": "54c72687f6765050b5d52bca86beb2e8", "meta": {"organization": {"name": "Colorado School of Mines", "location": "Golden, Colorado, United States"}}, "meetingId": "8738333d2c9a488a90af32a4074dc175", "id": "7322220501e44636ad4f0d69366bbaeb"}], "name": "Space Resources Roundtable - XXII Meeting", "location": "Golden, Colorado", "id": "8738333d2c9a488a90af32a4074dc175", "url": "https://learn.mines.edu/srr/abstracts/", "startDate": "2022-06-07T04:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "2022 SRR Abstract Lunabotics Mueller.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20220005359/downloads/2022%20SRR%20Abstract%20Lunabotics%20Mueller.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20220005359/downloads/2022%20SRR%20Abstract%20Lunabotics%20Mueller.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20220005359/downloads/2022%20SRR%20Abstract%20Lunabotics%20Mueller.pdf.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
