b'Near Earth Asteroid Characteristics for Asteroid Threat Assessment\nJessie Dotson1\nNASA Ames Research Center\nInformation about the physical characteristics of Near Earth Asteroids (NEAs) is\nneeded to model behavior during atmospheric entry, to assess the risk of an\nimpact, and to model possible mitigation techniques. The intrinsic properties of\ninterest to entry and mitigation modelers, however, rarely are directly\nmeasureable. Instead we measure other properties and infer the intrinsic\nphysical properties, so determining the complete set of characteristics of interest\nis far from straightforward. In addition, for the majority of NEAs, only the basic\nmeasurements exist so often properties must be inferred from statistics of the\npopulation of more completely characterized objects. We will provide an\nassessment of the current state of knowledge about the physical characteristics\nof importance to asteroid threat assessment. In addition, an ongoing effort to\ncollate NEA characteristics into a readily accessible database for use by the\nplanetary defense community will be discussed.\n\n'
