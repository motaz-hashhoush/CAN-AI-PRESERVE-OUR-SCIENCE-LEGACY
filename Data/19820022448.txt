The use\nof this publication for official test operations is not authorized.\n\n-3/4-\n\nTELESAT-F (ANTK-D1) SPACECRAFT DESCRIPTION\n\nTelesat-F (An1k-Dl), a 24-channel communications satellite designed for use within Canada, will be launched on\na two-stage Delta 3920 launch vehicle from Launch Complex 17, Pad-B, on the Cape Canaveral Air Force Station,\nFla. The Delta will place the spacecraft into a low earth-impact trajectory with an apogee of 100 nautical\nmiles (185 kilometers).\nA solid propel 1 ant motor assembly called the Payload Assist Module (RAM) will be used to raise Telesat-F from\nthe low impact trajectory into an elliptical transfer orbit with an apogee of 19,654 nautical miles (36,366\nkilometers) and a perigee of 100 nautical miles (185 kilometers), at an inclination to the equator of 24.5 degrees. The RAM, conceived and built by the McDonnell Douglas Astronautics Company, comprises three major elements; a payload attach fitting, a Thiokol developed solid rocket motor, and a spin table. The solid rocket\nmotor has a burn time of approximately 85 seconds at an average thrust of 15,000 pounds (6672 N), capable of\nboosting spacecraft weights of up to 2800 Ibs (1270 kg) on a Delta 3920 launch vehicle. A safe and arm device\nfor the RAM is located on the payload attach fitting. After the solid rocket motor has completed firing, the\nentire assembly is separated from the spacecraft.\nAfter Telesat-F has been injected into its transfer orbit, overall control of the spacecraft will pass-to the\nTelesat Satellite Control Center in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. Telesat controllers, using data from tracking\nstations on Guam and at Allan Park, Ontario, will evaluate the spacecraft health, commandability and attitude.\nAt fifth apogee, an axial Reaction Control System (RCS) maneuver is performed to raise the transfer orbit\nperigee to 436 nautical miles (808 kilometers). Just prior to equator crossing at seventh apogee, the controllers will correctly orient the spacecraft and fire the onboard solid propellant apogee kick motor. This\nfinal burn will transfer the spacecraft into a circular drift orbit a little below geosynchronous altitude-.\nIf, for some reason, attitude dispersions still exist at seventh apogee, the above events may be delayed until\nninth apogee.\nA satellite which is slightly below the correct altitude for geosynchronous orbit will drift eastward or westward along the equator. It is planned for Telesat-F to drift westward at a rate of approximately 4\xc2\xb0 per day\nuntil it arrives on station at 104\xc2\xb0 west longitude. At this time the on-board RCS will be activated to halt\nthe westward drift and raise the spacecraft to geosynchronous orbit at an altitude of 19,324 nautical miles\n(35,792 kilometers). To maintain this geosynchronous station, the spacecraft will have a final velocity of\napproximately 6,876 miles (11,066 kilometers) per hour.\nThe Anik-Dl spacecraft is built by Spar Aerospace Ltd. for Telesat and is designed to operate over a 10-year\nlife span. The two main elements of the spacecraft are the spinning rotor, comprising 70 percent of the onstation vehicle weight, and the despun earth-oriented platform containing the communication repeater and its\nantenna. A rotating interface, consisting of ball bearings and slip rings permits signal transfers to take\nplace, and affords an electrical path over which power from the solar panels and batteries can flow to the repeater payload. The overall spacecraft length at launch is 112 inches (284 centimeters); its maximum diameter\nis 85.33 inches (217 centimeters). After antenna deployment and extension of one solar panel cylinder, the\n-5-\n\noverall spacecraft length is 265 inches (673 centimeters). It has an in-orbit weight of 1452 Ib (659 kilograms) after consumption of apogee motor propel 1 ants.\nThe spinning structure is built around a central thrust tube composed of two frustrum cones, a cylinder, and\nfive frames. The equipment shelf, attached to the thrust tube, is an aluminum honeycomb sandwich platform\nwith aluminum facesheets. The despun compartment structure consists of a monocoque conical frustrum, annular\nand cylindrical honeycomb sandwich shelves, and a pair of bipods which support the antenna assembly. All communication equipment is located on the despun honeycomb sandwich shelves. Four locking devices at the spinning shelf rim join the despun and spinning sections for launch. Axial loading from the solar arrays,\nbatteries, and the despun communication equipment is carried directly to the spacecraft base through a load\npath comprising the Bearing and Power Transfer Assembly (BAPTA), the spun shelf, and struts to the separation\nplane, while lateral loading is transferred to the central thrust cone via the spinning shelf and launch\nlocks. Four polar mounted propulsion tanks between eight radial support struts are connected by tubular\nbipod/tripod structures to the central cone.\nThe spinning equipment shelf, supported at and near its rim.by eight struts, carries earth sensors, radial\nthrusters and batteries on the forward face and, on the aft face, the encoders, decoders, power control electronics, and attitude control equipment. Components also are mounted to the central thrust tube cone. These\ninclude the axial thrusters, the safe and arm unit, the spacecraft/PAM interface umbilical connectors, and the\nbus limiters. The solar array substrate is rigidly attached to the spinning shelf via eight shear bearing\nfittings which minimize local substrate deformation.\nVarious spacecraft components are stowed in the launch position and subsequently released by firing pyrotechnic devices (squibs). Among those items restrained are the reflector and omni antennas, the despun shelf, and\nthe aft retracted solar panel. In the stowed position, the antenna reflector is folded over the despun shelf\nand secured at four places. The omni antenna folds above the reflector and is retained at one point. The despun shelf is secured at four places while the aft solar panel is locked at three attach fittings. The squib\ndriver circuits for the shelf and panel release bolt cutters are located in the squib and solenoid driver unit\nwhile the antenna releases are fired through driver circuits in the antenna positioner electronics box. All\nmechanisms are provided with redundant squibs.\nThe spacecraft configuration uses a part of the solar panel drum as a dedicated, mirrored, thermal radiator.\nNinety percent of spacecraft thermal dissipation is provided by this radiator which provides a low temperature, highly stable, heat sink for battery temperature control. A small annular radiator on the substrate\nforward end provides equipment thermal dissipation in transfer orbit when the stowed aft panel covers the primary drum radiator. A low emittance, despun, thermal radiator barrier on the forward end helps stabilize\nequipment temperatures. The aft end enclosure is a low thermal barrier, black outboard that protects the\ninterior of the spacecraft from apogee motor plume impingement and solar heat.\n-6-\n\nThe Anik-Dl 6/4 GHz satellite communications subsystem consists of two basic sections: a dual polarizationselective grid antenna that provides independent transmit and receive beams at both polarizations, and a communications repeater composed of broadband input and channelized output sections. The communications subsystem receives low-level signals from the transmitting ground stations, amplifies and converts these^signal s\nfrom 6 GHz to 4GHz, channelizes the signals for routing to the output Traveling Wave Tube Amplifiers (TWTAs)\nwhere the signals are further amplified, and then feeds them to the high gain antennafor transmission.\nThe telemetry, command/track, and ranging subsystem provides the ground command capability and the spacecraft\nperformance and status information required to properly control the spacecraft. The subsystem also provides\nsingle-axis spacecraft communications antenna pointing information to the\' Attitude Control Subsystem (ACS) by\nmonopulse tracking the command uplink signal (RF beacon tracking function). The subsystem can be configured\nas a transponder for transfer orbit tone ranging. All RF hardware is located on the despun side of the spacecraft. The baseband Telemetry and Command (T&C) hardware consists of redundant despun command decoders and\ntelemetry encoders and redundant spinning command decoders, telemetry encoders, and squib and solenoid drivers. The baseband spinning and despun units interface through signal slip rings contained within the BAPTA.\nThe spacecraft telemetry subsystem gathers subsystem performance, sensor, status, and attitude information .\nnecessary for the proper operation of the spacecraft. The subsystem provides this information via an RF downlink during transfer orbit, drift orbit, and on-station operation.\nA command subsystem, consisting of two identical, redundant, and simultaneously operating channels of receiving demodulation and decoding hardware, continually provides complete control capability over all spacecraft\nstates and modes of operations; however, all commanded automatic functions can be overidden by ground command.\nThe command subsystem is also equipped to handle baseband formats used for special functions. These are the\naxial thruster off-pulsing and pseudo earth formats.\nThe command subsystem includes a spinning squib and solenoid driver unit, and despun squib drivers located in\nantenna positioner electronics. The spinning unit contains squib drivers to initiate pyrotechnic devices for\nfiring the apogee motor and for releasing the despun shelf.and solar panel locks. It also contains valve drivers for the axial and radial thrusters and the latch valves. The despun squib drivers release the omni antenna mast and the communication antenna reflector. All squib firing commands are provided with separate enable commands and enable status telemetry. Solenoid drivers are used to actuate isolation latch valves and\nthe thruster valves in the reaction control subsystem. Each solenoid driver can be actuated by either of\ntwo spinning decoders.\nThe ACS provides velocity control, spin axis attitude control and stabilization, and antenna pointing control\nthroughout the spacecraft mission lifetime. Velocity maneuvers are executed by ground commanded thruster firings, while attitude maneuvers may be accomplished by either ground command or autonomous thruster pulsing.\nThese maneuvers and the spin speed operating range are selected so that no additional spin control is required\n-7-\n\nfor a.nominal mission, while positive spin control is provided if necessary. Data for ground attitude\ndetermination are supplied by sun and earth sensors during transfer and drift orbits.\nThe power subsystem consisting of solar panels, batteries, power control electronics and wiring harnesses, is\ndesigned to satisfy all spacecraft load requirements for the mission lifetime. Spacecraft power is provided\nby a single bus located on the spun section; power is delivered to the despun section via the BAPTA redundant\npower slip rings. During sunlight operation, all spacecraft loads receive power from the main solar arrays at\n29.75 vdc. The main arrays consist of matrix connections of silicon solarcells. During transfer orbit, the\naft cylindrical solar panel, stowed over the fixed forward cylindrical so-lar panel, provides satellite power.\nIn synchronous orbit, the aft panel is extended to its normal position and power at initial operation of 1000\nwatts is supplied by both solar panels. Three 32-cell, 17.3 A-hr nickel-cadmiumbatteries provide electrical\nenergy during launch, transfer orbit, and solar eclipses. The batteries are on-line during sunlight operation\nto supplement the solar arrays in supplying power for fault clearing or transients. The batteries are charged\nby charge arrays which can be commanded to achieve the desired charge rate.\nThe RCS performs satellite velocity and attitude control maneuvers in response to onboard and ground commands.\nWhen commanded, the thruster valve opens and hydrazine is pressure-fed to the thruster, which catalytically\ndecomposes the hydrazine to produce thrust. The propellant is contained in two conispherical titanium alloy\ntanks per half subsystem. A cross-connect latch valve allows transfer of propellant between subsystem halves",\nmaking all propellant available to any thruster. Each half subsystem contains a squib valve in the gas mainfold connecting the two tanks, preventing propellant migration when the tanks are at different heights during\nlaunch operations.\nThere are two thrusters per half subsystem, one axial and one radial. Radial thrusters operate individually\nfor station acquistion and spacecraft east-west station keeping. The more heavily used axial thrusters provide ANC (post-PAM separation), station acquisition, injection error corrections, attitude trim, and northsouth station keeping. All thrusters are operated in the pulse mode with the axial thrusters also operating\nin the continuous mode. Operating requirements are derived from spacecraft attitude control and station\nkeeping requirements.\n\n-8-\n\nDELTA LAUNCH VEHICLE\nFirst launched by NASA in May 1960, the reliable Delta vehicle can be utilized in various combinations of stages\nand strap-on motors, sized to meet the particular requirements of individual missions. The Delta has been flown\nas a two- or three-stage vehicle, with zero, three, six, or nine Castor II or nine Castor IV solid propellant\nmotors attached to the first stage. A Delta is now 116 feet (35.4 m) tall and 8 feet (2.4 m) in diameter (not\nincluding the solids). This vehicle has a gross weight of approximately 422,688 pounds (191,731 kg) at liftoff.\nStage I is a long-tank derivative of the Thor vehicle, measuring 74 feet (22.5 m) in length and 8 feet (2.4 m)\nin diameter. It is powered by a Rocketdyne RS-27 main engine system that burns RP-1 and liquid oxygen. The\nmain engine, plus the two vernier engines, is rated at 207,000 pounds (920,777 N) of thrust at sea level, and\nhas a burn time of approximately 228 seconds.\nThis vehicle utilizes nine Castor IV solid propellant strap-on motors for additional first stage thrust. A.Castor IV is 36.9 feet (11.2 m) in length, 3.3 feet (1 m) in diameter, and weighs about 24,500 pounds (11,113 kg)*\nEach motor delivers an average of 85,270 pounds (379,298 N) of thrust for 57 seconds. Six ignite at liftoff and\nthree ignite after the first six burn out. Total first stage thrust averages 720,620 pounds (3,205,318 N) from\nliftoff to burnout of the six solids.\nStage II is approximately 21 feet (6.4 m) long and 68 inches (173 cm) in diameter. The new AJ10-118K main\n\'engine, built by Aerojet General uses nitrogen tetroxide as the oxidizer and Aerozene-50 as the fuel. It\nproduces 9,900 pounds (44,035 N) of thrust and can burn for over 430 seconds.\nThe second stage has an 8-foot (2.4 m) wide and 11-inch (28 cm) high structural assembly called the miniskirt\nattached 3.5 feet (1 m) from its top. This miniskirt rests on an 8-foot (2.4 m) diameter interstage barrel 15.5\nfeet (4.7 m) high, which extends upward from the top of the first stage. A 26-foot (7.9 m) high fairing sits on\ntop of the miniskirt and completes the exterior view of the vehicle. The second stage hangs down inside the interstage and extends up into the fairing, protected from contact with the atmosphere during first stage flight.\nThe Delta Redundant Inertial Measurement System (DRIMS), which controls the flight of the vehicle, is mounted in\nthe second stage. It consists of an inertial sensor package and a digital guidance computer. The sensor package provides vehicle attitude and acceleration information to the guidance computer, which controls the sequence\nof operations. The guidance computer generates vehicle steering commands for Stage I and II. These steering\ncommands correct trajectory deviations by comparing computed positions and velocities against established values. The computer also controls timing, staging, and engine restarts, including those for engineering experimental burns performed after the main mission. The RAM stage is held on a steady course by its spinning motion,\nand requires no guidance.\n\n-9-\n\nTELESAT-F (ANIK-Dl) LAUNCH WINDOWS\n\nWindow No. 1\nClose\nOpen\n\nDate\n\nDuration\n(min.)\n\n19\n\nEOT\nGMT\n\n1922\n2322\n\n1926\n2326\n\n4\n\n20\n\nEOT\nGMT\n\n1922\n2322\n\n1927\n2327\n\n21\n\nEOT\nGMT\n\n1921\n2321\n\n22\n\nEOT\nGMT\n\n23\n\nAugust\n\n.\n\nWindow No. 2\nOpen\nClose\n\nDuration\n(min.)\n\nWindow No. 3\nOpen\nClose\n\nDuration\n(min.)\n\n2006\n0006*\n\n2011\n0011*\n\n5\n\n2051\n0051*\n\n2143\n0143*\n\n52\n\n5\n\n2007\n0007*\n\n2011\n0011*\n\n4\n\n2051\n0051*\n\n2143\n0143*\n\n52\n\n1927\n2327\n\n6\n\n2007\n0007*\n\n2012\n0012*\n\n5\n\n2051\n0051*\n\n2143\n0143*\n\n52\n\n1921\n2321\n\n1928\n2328\n\n7\n\n2007\n0007*\n\n2012\n0012*\n\n5\n\n2051\n0051*\n\n2143\n0143*\n\n52\n\nEOT\nGMT\n\n1921\n2321\n\n1928\n2328\n\n7\n\n2008\n0008*\n\n2012\n0012*\n\n4\n\n2052\n0052*\n\n2142\n0142*\n\n50\n\n24\n\nEOT\nGMT\n\n1920\n2320\n\n1928\n2328\n\n8\n\n2008\n0008*\n\n2013\n0013*\n\n5\n\n2052\n0052*\n\n2142\n0142*\n\n50\n\n25\n\nEOT\nGMT\n\n1920\n2320\n\n1929\n2329\n\n9\n\n2008\n0008*\n\n2013\n0013*\n\n5\n\n2052\n0052*\n\n2141\n0141*\n\n49\n\n26\n\nEOT\nGMT\n\n1919\n2319\n\n1929\n2329\n\n10\n\n2009\n0009*\n\n2013\n0013*\n\n4\n\n2052\n0052*\n\n2140\n0140*\n\n48\n\n27\n\nEOT\nGMT\n\n1919\n2319\n\n1929\n2329\n\n10\n\n2009\n0009*\n\n2013\n0013*\n\n4\n\n2053\n0053*\n\n2140\n0140*\n\n47..\n\n28\n\nEOT\nGMT\n\n1918\n2318\n\n1930\n2330\n\n12\n\n2009\n0009*\n\n2014\n0014*\n\n5\n\n2053\n0053*\n\n2139\n0139*\n\n46\n\n29\n\nEOT\nGMT\n\n1918\n2318\n\n1930\n2330\n\n12\n\n2010\n0010*\n\n2014\n0014*\n\n4\n\n2053\n0053*\n\n2138\n0138*\n\n45\n\n30\n\nEOT\nGMT\n\n1917\n2317\n\n1930\n2330\n\n13\n\n2010\n0010*\n\n2014\n0014*\n\n4\n\n2053\n0053*\n\n2138\n0138*\n\n45\n\n* Next day\n-10-\n\n*\n.\n\nANTICIPATED TELEMETRY COVERAGE\nIt is planned that Delta-164 telemetry data w i l l be received by TEL-IV, Merritt Island U n i f i e d S-band Station\n( M I L ) , Antigua (ANT), Dakar ( D K R ) , Ascension - ETR (ASC), and Ascension - STDN ( A C N ) .
