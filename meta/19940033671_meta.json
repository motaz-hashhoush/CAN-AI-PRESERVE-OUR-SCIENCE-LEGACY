The forward areas on the skin of the fuselage, and on parts of the tail and wings, will be covered with panels of carbon/carbon or ceramic-matrix composites to protect against temperatures up to 1650 C. Timetal-21S, an advanced high-temperature version of a conventional alloy, combines heat resistance with excellent oxidation and corrosion resistance. Reinforced with SCS-6 SiC fibers, 21S withstands exposure to simulated NASP cycles that include temperature and load excursions representative of orbital and cruise missions. C/C panels a few millimeters thick would be mechanically attached to the underlying Timetal 21S structure over parts of the fuselage, providing protection up to 1650 C. Graphite/epoxy composites are the baseline materials for the hydrogen 'slush' fuel tank.", "title": "NASP launches new materials", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-16T12:14:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19940033671, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Ronald, Terence M.
