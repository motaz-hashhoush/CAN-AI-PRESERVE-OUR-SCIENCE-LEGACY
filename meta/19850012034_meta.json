The multimission capability is obtained adopting a modular concept of the satellite such to allow for: easy reconfiguration, easy refurbishment, and cost and schedule minimization. The modular concept is realized with: a payload module (PM), a service module (SM), and an auxiliary propulsion module (APM). The satellite configuration for the electrodynamic and atmospheric missions is described as well as its mechanized capabilities. Payload dedicated electrical facilities, satellite position determination accuracy; attitude control and measurement accuracy and attitude oscillation characteristics are summarized.", "title": "Satellite Module Design", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-12T15:20:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19850012034, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Vignoli, M."}, "organization": {"name": "Aeritalia S.p.A.", "location": "Naples, Italy"}}, "id": "f3a71401ede644e2ba5ad4005d62f212"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2014-09-16T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19850012034, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19850012034, "id": "67e5ce4e2b124e02a1ad47fe90b2452b", "publicationName": "NASA.
