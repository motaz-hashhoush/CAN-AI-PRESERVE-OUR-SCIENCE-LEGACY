Instrument landing systems (ILS) have been used\nto guide pilots in determining the location and size of runways.\nTRW has developed an ILS that uses a single, fixed, onboard\nmulti-bean antenna system and several low-cost RF beacons on\nthe ground to create an image of the runway as viewed from the\naircraft. The antenna system is comprised of a lens, RF processing modules, signal conversion circuitry, and a power supply, all\nmounted securely in a cylindrical housing in the aircraft.\nThe ILS requires six ground emitters - four to outline the runway and\ntwo more widely spaced apart to provide a more accurate indication of\nrange. The system does not produce a\n"camera-like" picture, but by using\noverlapping RF beams, a very accurate\nimage is created of the runway relative\nto the aircraft. Because this system requires relatively little\nequipment, its lower cost is ideal for smaller airports. It also enables pilots to fix their position on the ground for taxiing.\nGet the complete report on this tech nologv at:\nurww.nasatech.com/techsearch/tow/trw.html\n\nPolymer Blending Technique Reduces Cost\nand Improves Product\n\nG\xc3\xbcnter Sac*mann, Bayer AG\nBill Heise, Eastman Chemical\nConsumer personal care prod- -.\nucts such as baby diapers and fernmine hygiene products are coinposed of liquid-absorbing materials\ncalled superabsorbeit I polymer\n(SAPs).

Polymers are materials consisting of many small molI uk\'s, called monomers, linked together to form long chains\ntaIled macromolecules. Pol ymeric compounds are materials\ntitatle from a blend of polymers created in a generally expensive process called impact modification.\nEastman Chemical\'s new polymer blending technolog y called\n()ptiloy enables manufacturers to use emulsions in standard\nPET polytnenzauon reactors to create blends without expensive\nimpact modification This technology enables a wider range of\nblends to he created in a polymerization reactor, including Condensation-type polymers and a broader category of additiontype polymers that traditionall y have been created using extruder blending. Unlike conventional impact polymerization,\nOptiloy enables the manufacture of a wider range of polymer\nblends with a simpler manufacturing process, and without large\ncapital outlays for additional equipment, reducing overall cost.\n(;et the complete report on this technology at:\nwww.nasatech.com/techsearch/tow/eastman . html\n\nwww.nasatech.com\t\n\n15\n\nMEMS:\nNext\nhe basic idea has been ar( 11\nsince the 1960s - micron-si,\ndevices that measure typicall\nT few millimeters across. But iL\nbeen only in the last decade that Mk\nelectromechanical Systems (MEMS) and\nnanotechnology have become important parts of most areas of science and\ntechnology.\nMEMS devices are similar in most ways\nto conventional devices such as sensors\nand accelerometers, but at a much\nsmaller size. Nanotechnologv refers to\ndevices ranging in size from a nanometer to a micron. Made using semiconductor fabrication techniques, micro\ninjection molding, or other more specialized processes, MEMS devices are\nfrequently combined with integrated circuits on a single chip.\nThe benefits of using MEMS technology are many, including the obvious benefit of size. And while you may think the\nsmaller a device, the higher the cost,\nthink again. Thanks to integrated circuit\nprocessing methods, thousands of MEMS\ncan be mass-produced on a single six-inch\nsilicon wafer, making MEMS less expensive to produce than conventional parts.\nMEMS also enables new functionality,\naccording to Andrew Swiecki, vice president of sales and marketing for IntelliSense, a subsidiary of Corning that designs, develops, and manufactures\nMEMS devices, as well as sells MEMSspecific CAD software called IntelliSuite\'. "There are many things that can\nbe done with MEMS devices that can\'t\nbe done with other devices." For example, he added, MEMS devices are very\nlow in mass and are very reliable structures, so they can be used in all-optical\nswitching.\nNew applications for these miniature\nwonders are popping up every day.

Automotive applications such as airbag sensors comprise one-third of the total market, while the medical market is the\nsecond largest industry using MEMS in\nproducts like disposable blood pressure\nsensors.\nSmart munitions that can alter their\npaths after firing, robotic grippers, metering nozzles for inkjet printers, drug\ndelivery systems, accelerometers used in\nantilock braking systems, and automotive sensors for measuring fuel level, tire\ninflation, and oil pressure are just some\nof the many applications for MEMS. The\ntelecommunications industry has been\ninvaded by the MEMS wave, primarily\nfor reliable optical switches.\nwww.nasatech.com\t\n\nAccording to Tom Connolly, engineering manager of silicon products for\nEndevco Corp. - a supplier of sensors,\naccelerometers, and transducers - the\nmedical and automotive fields hold the\ngreatest promise for commercial success\nof MEMS. "We\'re getting into the health\nfield in pacemakers," he said. "Basically,\nwe\'re using an accelerometer to determine the activity level of the person with\nthe pacemaker.

We go for niche markets and applications like inertial measurement\nunits for guided missiles. The volumes\naren\'t very high, but we\'re able to work\nwith specific application requirements,"\nhe added.\nConnolly sees the MEMS market on\nthe verge of an explosion. "They\'re talking about it becoming a $2 billion market. From our little world, we\'re seeing\nincreased demand as applications open\ntip." As the market expands, explained\nConnoll y, applications are growing in\nthe health and entertainment fields. "As\nacceptance increases and the costs keep\ncoming down, it really is becoming quite\na flood."\n\nDesign Challenges\nSo when these flood gates open and\nmore MEMS devices pour out into commercial industries, who will make them,\nand how small will the y get? MEMSbased designs can produce systems on a\nchip, in which a transceiver, batteries,\nsensors, and microprocessor are all on a\nsingle component not much larger than\na postage stamp. The trick is designing\neach miniature piece of the system, and\nmaking sure they are manufacturable\nand durable enough to operate.\nMEMS devices are surprisingly rugged\nand can operate for long periods of time\non little power. They must he able to en(lure damaging internal heat build-up,\nand withstand excessive structural loads,\nambient temperature swings, and severe\nshock and vibration.\n"MEMS is a unique technology, so\nthere will always he unique design challenges," said Swiecki. "For every commercial MEMS device that\'s developed,\nboth the device itself and the process to\nmake it need to be developed." Another\nchallenge, explained Swiecki, is that\nMEMS requires a lot of engineering disciplines. In order to create a new MEMS\ndevice, he said, it company needs "chemical engineers, process engineers, mechanical engineers, electrical engineers,\npotentially fluidic engineers - a great\ndeal of diverse expertise."\nThat expertise includes the ability to\nsimulate and analyze how these devices\nwill perform. Software vendors have even\nbegun to specifically address MEMS development as a capability of their products.\nALGOR, a supplier of Finite Element\nAnalysis (FEA)-based simulation software,\nhas incorporated tools for simulating\nMEMS.

"On a more practical level, the applications will define how\nsmall devices need to be for each application."\n\nWhere MEMS is Going\nPerhaps the most innovative and exciting applications for MEMS technology are coming not from commercial\nindustry, but from university, government, and independent research labs.\nNASA has been a leader in the development of MEMS technology for missions requiring lower cost, smaller size,\nlower weight, and less power consumption. Nanotechnology development\nhas been underway at a number of\nNASA centers, including The Center\nfor Space Microelectronics Technologv\'s Microdevices Laboratory at\nNASA\'s Jet Propulsion Lab in\nPasadena, CA.

High-temperature pressure sensors, chemical sensors, bio-MEMS, and silicon-carbide microdevices are under development.\nNanotechnology also is opening doors\nto new materials such as carbon nanotubes, a new form of carbon that measures a few nanometers in diameter and\nseveral microns long. Carbon nanotubes\nhave exceptional mechanical properties.\nResearchers at NASA\'s Marshall Space\nFlight Center in Huntsville, AL, are\nworking on carbon nanotube material\nthat is 100 times stronger than steel. Researchers at IBM in Yorktown Heights,\nN\'i already have fabricated arrays of\ntransistors from carbon nanotuhes,\npaving the way for electronic circuitry\nsmaller and faster than anything silicon\ncould support.\nIBM\'s work is just one example of\ncommercial companies taking advantage of MEMS and nanotechnology.\nSaid Swiecki, "The larger companies\nwith more developed manufacturing\nsystems and a more flexible infrastructure are beginning to take a lead role\nin applying MEMS technology to commercial products." The future of\n\\IEMS, he added, is in the applications. "If you asked me ten years ago\nwhere the market would be today, I\nwould have been wrong. We\'ll see\nmore commercial applications, and\nwe\'ll see the technology maturing.\nThere is a lot of potential for MEMS\ntechnology. We don\'t always know\nwhat will come out of that potential,\nbut we do believe it\'s one of those enabling technologies that will continue\nto grow."\nFor Free Info Circle No. 405 or\nEnter No. 405 at www.nasatech.com/rs \t\n\nwww.nasatech.com \t\n\nGet Connected to the\nCompanies Featured\nin this Article:\nALGOR, Inc.....................www.algor.com\nANSYS ..........................www.ansys.com\nEndevco Corp ...........www.endevco.com\nFiso Technologies ...........www.fiso.com\nFrost & Sullivan .............www.frost.com\nIBM .................................www.ibm.com\nIntelliSense ..........www.inteiisense.com\nNASA JPL\'s Microdevices\nLaboratory ......http:!/csmt.jpl.nasa.gov/\ncsmtpages/index, html\nRoger Grace\nAssociates ...............www.rgrace.com\n\nRecommended Reading\nHandbook of Nanostructured\nMaterials and Nanotechnology\nA comprehensive five-volume guide\nto nanotechnology today.\nAvailable in the NASA Tech Briefs\non-line bookstore:\nwww.nasatech.com/store\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 2001\n\npimp, Ink\n\n.- \xe2\x80\x94\n\n,.\n\nabhHI\n\n\t\n\nIT, WE CA D\n\n\'V\n\nEmhart is a world leader in the design and supply of innovative fastening and assembly\ntechnology.

It allows you to associate one type of\ninput with another. For instance, we can\nprogram a robot to know that if it encounters a four-legged animal that barks,\nit\'s a dog. Or, if the four-legged animal\nmeows, it \'s a cat. Based on the input, we\ncan give the robot parameters on how to\ndeal with what it encounters.\nOne of the nice things about artificial\nintelligence is that the applications may\nchange, but you can use a lot of the same\ntechniques. Neural networks are a type of\nlearning tool, so anything that you can\nlearn, you can apply a neural network to.\nIf you have the infrastructure, you may\nhave to tweak things here and there, but\nthe background is so solid that you don\'t\nhave to re-engineer the entire process.\nNTB: You also use a lot of fuzzy logic in\nyour projects. What is fuzzy logic?\nDr. Howard: Everything in the real\nworld is not exact nothing is 100 perCent. We, as people, deal with this all the\ntime. If we\'re walking and the ground is\nsuddenly uneven, we don\'t fall - we compensate. Yet, if a robot is walking on flat\nterrain and suddenly there\'s a hill, it will\nfall down because it won\'t know how to\ndeal with it. The example I like to use is\nbabies. A baby will learn how to walk. But\nif something drastic happens, and say, it\nloses a toe, the baby will adapt. Humans\nuse approximation. We don\'t see a cat\nuvww. nasatech.com\n\n\t\n\nand think about the measured physical dimensions of the cat. We say that the cat is\nbi. or small, or fuzzy.\nFuzzy logic takes what humans use ipproximatlon, language, and linguisticl)thed representation - and applies it in\nterms of an engineering technology.\n\nNTB: Could any of these artificial\nintelligence techniques be applied for\ncommercial use in the near future?\nDr. Howard: Manufacturing would definitely be a field where these types of programs could be used. Japan actually uses a\nlot of fuzzy logic in their plants, so that\'s\ndefinitely a possibility for further use. In\nfact, right now you have companies trying\nto do pallet operations where they want the\nautomated forklift to go into a warehouse,\nfind the pallet it needs, lift it up, and take\nit out to the truck for shipment. That\'s the\ntype of thing for which you could use\nneural networks and fuzzy logic, because it\nis basically the same problem. It actually\nwould be easier because you would know\nwhat the warehouse looks like. It would be\neasier to apply these techniques to known\nelements and manmade structures than it\nis to apply it to an unknown environment\nlike the surface of Mars.\nNTh:How has the response to this sort\nof technology changed as it has grown?\nDr. Howard: Interest has grown. People\nnow see the validity of this technology, especially if you want to send an intelligent\ndevice into a place where you don\'t want\nhumans to go. Anywhere that human life\nmight be endangered, you can send something powered by artificial intelligence.\nUnderwater robotics is a good example.\nWe like to send probes down to the bottom\nof the sea. Due to things like severe pressure, you don\'t want to send people. You\'d\nsend a robot with the same characteristics.\nOnly this time, you have a 3D world instead\nof a flat plane. That\'s where fuzzy logic\ncomes in. In terms of the neural networks,\nbecause we don\'t know exactly what it\nlooks like down there, we give the robot\nthe abilityto adapt to the situation even if\nour initial data was incorrect.\nA full transcript of this interview appears\non-line at www.nasatech.com/whoswho.

In comparison with a traditional\ndeep-space transponder, the STM will be\nsmaller and less power hungry; the reductions in size and power demand will be effected by use of custom application-specific integrated circuits. The STM will\nperform all of the traditional deep-spacetransponder functions, plus some coding,\ndecoding, and time-tagging functions:\nThe STM will track an X-hand uplink signal and transmit both X- and Ka-band\ndownlinks. A command detector, a codeblock processor, and hardware command\ndecoder will be integral parts of the STM.\n\nCoding functions will include ReedSolomon coding, convolutional coding,\nand turbo coding for downlink telemetry.\nDownlink symbol rates could be ramped\nlinearly to match the expected gain/noise\ntemperature of a receiving station.

(In\nHebbian synapses, the synaptic weights\nare modified through Hebbian learning, which is a local unsupervised adjustment of the weight depending on\nthe correlation of activity between pre-\n\nand post-synaptic neurons.) These circuits are intended, more specifically,\nfor use with neural networks of the\ntype that operate with spiking (as distinguished from steady) input and output signals.\nThe development of these circuits was\nprompted by a need to store and adjust\non-chip s ynaptic weights using local Hebbian learning rules. The synaptic weights\nmust be stored in the form of analog volt-\n\nages (charges on capacitive nodes). Such\nstorage is problematic because the\ncharges tend to decay by leakage\nthrough reverse-biased active/well/substrate junctions. The designs of the present circuits reduce the leakage currents to about one-sixth of those\nconventional synaptic-weight-storage\ncircuits, thereby making it possible to\nstore the synaptic weights for correspondingly longer times.\n\nPre-synaptic\nSpikes >\nTA2\n\nPost-synaptic\nSpikes\n\nPost-synaptic 1\nNeuron\n\n+ TA1\n\nbiasi\t\n\nFloating Well\n\nVreti\n\nA Hebbian Synapse for spiking neurons is illustrated.\n\n28\t\n\nwww.nasatech.com\t\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 2001\n\nTHESE WILL\n\nA CAE electromagnetic package\nthat immediately boosts\nproductivity and saves prototyping\ncosts is hard to find.

The\nfloating well is driven by a voltage follower (VF in the figure) from the storage node, thereby shielding the storage\nnode by reducing the leakage current\nto the well and enabling the node to\nhold the charge longer than an ordinary switched capacitor could. The voltage across the active/well junction is\nheld to within the offset of the follower;\nthis typically results in a substantial decrease in leakage current from a normal well that is held at the supply voltage of the well transistor.\n\nThe charge-storage subcircuit is incorporated within a larger circuit that acts\nas a Hebbian synapse; that is, it takes\npre- and post-synaptic spike signals as inputs, and increases the synaptic weight if\nthe spikes occur simultaneously. The\nHebbian-synapse circuit (see figure)\ncontains two additional transconductance amplifiers (TAs): TAI controls the\nlearning rate by adjusting the current injected into the storage node, and TA2\nconverts the stored analog voltage value\nto a current value. The output of amplifier TA2 is gated by the pre-synaptic\ninput spikes, and hence the final output\nconsists of current pulses that are proportional to the stored voltage and injected into a post-synaptic neuron whenever the pre-synaptic neuron fires a\n\nspike. These output current pulses can\nbe summed and integrated with the currents from other synapses in parallel and\nused to drive the spiking of the postsynaptic neuron. Hebbian learning is\nachieved by gating charge onto or off\nthe storage node when the pre- and postsynaptic spikes are simultaneous or nonsimultaneous, respectively.\nThis work was done 6y Christopher Assad\nand David Kewley of Caltech for NASA\'s Jet\nPropulsion Laboratory.

("12C"\nsignifies "inter integrated circuit bus"\n- a bus developed by Philips Semiconductors in the early 1980s.) The\noriginal design of the 1 2C bus lacks\nfault-tolerant features that could protect against bit errors, shorting of output drives, or babbling nodes (nodes\nthat misbehave or disrupt normal\ncommunication). The present design\nadds such features: It augments the\nstandard 1 2C bus protocol with lowoverhead error-detection features and\na fail-silent messaging system, and it\nadds hardware features that automatically isolate babbling nodes. These\nfault-tolerant features can be disabled\nthrough software (for example, to aid\ntesting), but the design makes it difficult to do this accidentally.\nThe principal advantaes of the present design over prior 1C-bus designs\nare the following:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Cyclic redundancy checking (CRC) is\nused to obtain partial immunity to erlots in messages on the bus.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 l)cvices on the bus are inhibited from\nmonopolizing the bus, even when\nhardware or software faults occur.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Special commands have been added to\nenable direct control of one node by\nanother.\nFor Free Info Circle No. 411 or Enter No. 411 at www.nasatech.com/rs\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 2001\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Asynchronous logic in the basic design\nhas been replaced with synchronous\nlogic.\nIn addition, the bus is compatible with\ndevices that have been designed to function on previously designed, standard\nversions of the 12C bus.\nThe overall function of a controller\naccording to the present design is that of\nan interface between a peripheral component interface (PCI) bus and an 12C\nbus. The design calls for some basic 12C\nbus-controller components anti associated logic circuitry for a (PCI) port, plus\napplication-specific integrated circuits\n(ASICs) that implement logic functions\nto manage the flow of messages and to\nexert digital input/output (DIO) control. Additional logic circuits are used as\nwatchdog timers and to effect CRC. On\neach DIO ASIC, there are two 1 2C bus\ncontrollers that drive separate system\nand subsystem busses. Within each 12C\nbus controller, there are two LC commercial-off-the-shelf 1 2C cores.

As used here, "arraying" signifies combining the signals\nreceived by multiple antennas at different locations in such a way as to improve\nreception, as though one had a single\nlarger antenna. Going beyond synthesis\nof a larger antenna, the present method\nalso provides for extraction of Doppler\nfrequency shifts and differential delays of\nsignals, thereby enabling the generation\nof information on the ranges and veloci-\n\nties of signal sources. The method was\ndevised to enhance spacecraft-tracking\nand -telemetry operations in NASA\'s\nDeep Space Network (DSN); the method\ncould also be useful in such other applications as radio astronomy, commercial\nsatellite communications, and radio (including television) broadcasting.\nIn this method, the signals from the\nmultiple antennas in an array are combined in real time by use of correlation\nprocessing, among other techniques, implemented by a combination of analog\nand digital electronic hardware and software. The signal received at each an-\n\ntenna is characterized b a dela y and a\nDoppler shift that depend on the relative\nposition and motion of the antenna and\nthe spacecraft or other signal source. In\norder to achieve full-spectrum arraying,\nit is necessary to alter the signal received\nby each antenna to make its delay and\nDoppler shift equal to the delays and\nDoppler shifts of the similarly altered signals received by the other antennas. The\naltered signals are then combined coherently to obtain an improved detection of\ntelemetry and navigation data.\nIn the original DSN application (see\nfigure), the signals received by as many\n\nAntenna (One of Eight)\nFSR\n-----------------------------------300-MHz IF\t\nAnalog\t\nSignal\t\n\n16-Ms/s, 8-Bit\nI and 0 Data\nND and\nDown Converter\n\n]\t\n\nDelay Lines\t\n\n01\t\n\n16-Ms/s, 8-Bit\nand 0 Data\nStreams to FSC\n\nPhase Rotator\t\n\nSignal\nMonitor\n\nData\nProcessor\n\nFeedback _\t\nFrom FSC\t\n\nReal-Time\nProcessor\n\nI\n\n-----------\n\nI\n\nFSC\n--------------------------------I\nI\t\nI\nI\nI\nI\nUp to Eight\nI\n________________________\n16-Ms/s. 8-Bit\nWeight\nI\nI and 0 Data Streams\ni\nand Sum\t\nConverter\nI\nFrom FSR5\n\'Ir Jr\n\nH__.*.\n\nI\n\nI\nFeedback\nto FSR\n\nSignal\nMonitor\n\nns__\nj\n_\n: ta\nDa\nPrssor\t\n_______\t\n\nH\n\n300-MHz\nAnalog Signal to\nIF Distribution\n\nReal-Time\nProcessor\n______________\n\nI\nI\nI\n------------------------------- I\n\nin mis impiementation or 1-ull-Spectrum Lombining, as many as eight signals in a 16-MHz-wide IF band centered at 300 MHz are processed by digital and\nanalog means to generate an enhanced IF signal, allowing for improvement of telemetry and navigation data.\n34\t\n\nwww.nasatech.com\t\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 2001\n\nInstead of buying separate instruments tor sourcing and measuring,\nget it all in one compact, cost-effective unit\xe2\x80\x94a Keithley Series 2400\nSourceMeter Each one combines a programmable power source\nwith a highly repeatable, 5/2 digit DMM in one handy, integrated unit.\nWhich means you can use it as a V-Source, I-Source, V-Meter, I-Meter\n\xe2\x80\x94even an ohmmeter.

The analog signal from\neach antenna is first down-converted to\nan intermediate-frequency (IF) band\ncentered at 300 MHz. Then in an FSR,\nthe IF signal is subjected to a combination of analog-to-digital (A/D) conversion and frequency down-conversion\nthat yields an in-phase (I) and a quadrature-phase (Q) data stream, each consisting of 8-bit samples at a rate of 16\nmegasamples per second. The delay and\nphase of the I and Q streams from each\n\nantenna are altered by use of a delay line\nand a phase rotator. Adjustment is made\nfirst by using delay prediction, followed\nby a feedback measurement of residual\ndelay and phase by the FSC.\nIn the FSC, cross-correlations of upper\nand lower sidehands from different antennas (e.g., of the upper sideband received by antenna I with the upper sidehand received by antenna 2) are\ncomputed. The correlations contain information on frequency-dependent and\nfrequency-independent phase offsets related in known ways to differential delays\nand Doppler shifts.

Each nanoklystron\nwould, as its name suggests, be a very\nsmall klystron.

An individual nanoklystron could\nhe fabricated in top and bottom halves\nfrom silicon wafers and would contain\nan integral output waveguide and feed\nhorn (see Figure 1). In typical operation, a nanoklystron without a mechanical tuner would generate power only\nat a fixed frequency. Thus, frequency\nagility and/or redundancy could be obtained by incorporating into the array\nmultiple nanoklystrons that are pretuned to generate signals at all required frequencies.\nThe array of nanoklystrons would he\nfabricated in substantially the same\nmanner as that of a single nanoklvstron,\nexcept that the nanoklystrons would be\nspaced at angular intervals near the peripherv of the wafer.

The program predicts concentration profiles for up to\nthree elements in the coating and substrate after various oxidation exposures.\nTernary cross terms and concentrationdependent diffusion coefficients are\ntaken into account. Recession of the\nsurface because of loss of solute is also\npredicted.\nThe program incorporates a previously developed mathematical model\nof growth and spalling of oxide, for use\nin simulation of either isothermal or\ncyclic oxidation exposures. The oxidespalling submodel accounts for consumption of solute at higher rates in\ncases of cyclic oxidation accompanied\nby total or partial loss of the oxide\nscale. The program can predict the life\nof the coating layer(s) on the basis of a\nconcentration-dependent or other failure criterion (e.g., the concentration\nof the solute at the surface falls to 2\npercent). Hence, the program facilitates parametric studies for evaluation\nof tradeoffs among coating and substrate parameters (e.g., coating thickness, solute concentration) to obtain\nthe same coating life or for identifying\nparameters that exert the greatest effect on coating life.\nWritten in an extension of FORTRAN\n77, COSIM contains numerous subroutines that render it easily modifiable for\napplication to different coating-oxidation problems.\n42\t\n\nThis program was written by James A.\nNesbitt of Glenn Research Center.

Enigma\nprovides capabilities for building geometric models, key-frame animation,\nand video recording, and provides\ngraphical front ends for use by simulation application programs. Enigma can\nadd textual and graphical overlays and\ncan incorporate such visual effects as\nfades and dissolves - features unavailable in many other 313-animation software packages. What is most remarkable\nabout Enigma is that additional expensive editing hardware is not necessary for\ntaking advantage of all of these features.\nCost and time savings have already\naccrued at Johnson Space Center,\nwhere major simulation application\nprograms are being ported to\nEnigma, and at other NASA centers,\nat the facilities of U.S. government\ncontractors, and at the Canadian\nSpace Agency. There is no doubt that\nEnigma can prove useful to other\ngovernment agencies and to private\nindustries. Within months of its introduction in April 1995, Enigma was already in use at approximately 100\nsites. Although several commercial\nproducts could offer competition to\nEnigma, none offers the full capabilities inherent in Enigma - especially\nin terms of rendering speeds and\nflexibility.\nEnigma was originally developed for\nthe U.S. space program. It was needed\nbecause several Space Shuttle and\nSpace Station engineering and mission operations activities have related\nbut divergent 313-visualization requirewww.nasatcch.com\t\n\nments. The space program has unique\nsoftware requirements pertaining to\n(1) generating 3D solid models for\nvarious uses, (2) defining the hierarchical relationships between models\nand other elements (e.g., cameras and\nlight sources) common to 3D environments, (3) generating graphical displays that reflect the outputs of simulations, and (4) producing animation\nsequences for documentation and\ntraining.\nPrior to the advent of Enigma, these\nrequirements were addressed individually, primarily by developing dedicated\nsoftware or purchasing commercialoff-the-shelf (COTS) software. However, COTS software offered as many\ndisadvantages as advantages. It was\ncostly to purchase or develop COTS\nsoftware that had to he converted in\norder to render it useful for multiple\nproducts. It was also costly to lose time\nwaiting for procurement, development, and execution of products.\nMoreover, cooperative efforts were\nhindered by data-conversion requiremerits and by the unfamiliarity of engineering personnel with software tools\nprocured or developed by other\ngroups. Enigma overcame these disadvantages.\nEnigma version 4.4 affords capabilities to build 3D solid models, define\nhierarchical relationships between\nmodels and other elements in the 3D\nenvironment, define and record animation on a video or computer disk,\nand generate graphical displays for\nsimulation software. The program also\nfeatures an on-line hypermedia documentation system. Enigma can be used\nas a stand-alone model-building, animation, and non-dynamic simulation\nsoftware tool, and as a display driver to\nprovide graphical support for other\nsimulation software tools.

Increasing emphasis on the performance and longevity of\nelastomer seals, used most\noften in aerospace and automotive applications, is\nFigure 1: Compression Stress Relaxation samples and test jigs.\nstrengthening the need for\nmore accurate CSR testing\nprocedures.\nCSR data is only valuable\nif different samples and\ntest jigs provide consistent\nresults. Obtaining reproducible, scaleable CSR results is now the primary\nemphasis for predicting\nlong-term sealing performance.\nIn the past, compression\nset resistance was relied\nupon to judge the performance of different materials, as a means of quality\ncontrol, and for specification purposes.

Smaller samples\ngenerally are more representative of gasketing profiles or\ncross sections. Smaller test\njigs also allow more samples\nto be evaluated in a smaller\nvolume of liquid, making\nthem easier to handle, drain\nfluid from, and cool.\nDyneon LLC, a 3M company, has designed a small\nCSR testjig that offers easier\nhandling for CSR testing.\nDyneon also has developed a\ncentering jig and pin indentor to help limit the rocking\neffects of shims. This equipment yields better-defined\nload deflection curves for\nthe determination of sealing force.\nTest results show how frictional effects on jigs and samples can affect the\nvariability of initial sealing force measurements. The use of lubricants and\npolished test surfaces will provide the\nbest results. The advantage of the Dyneon jigs and others that use removable shims is that uniform frictional\nproperties can be obtained by either\nrepolishing or replacing the shims for\na minimal cost.\nShape factor effects also are important to control during testing. Samples\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 2001\n\nwith high shape factors show more variability due to the large change in sealing force with small changes in deflection. Also, their high compressive\nmodulus makes it difficult to define the\nsealing force from changes in the slope\nof the load deflection curve. Using samples with lower shape factors appears to\nprovide more consistent data. Samples\nwith higher shape factors also appear to\nexperience increased sealing force loss.\nSealing force is affected, in part, by\nchanges in temperature - decreasing\nat lower temperatures and increasing\nat higher ones. Because of this, it is important to measure and control both\nthe sample and jig temperatures when\nmeasuring sealing force. I)yneon\'s test\njig provides a thermocouple well to\nallow for this measurement.\nIt is important to differentiate the\nsealing force responses that occur dur-\n\ning testing. Initial stress decay takes\nplace when the compressed sample\nreaches an equilibrium-relaxed value at\nroom temperature. Relaxation occurs\nwhen the sample is heated to a temperature above that at which it was compressed. This response is a result of\nthermal expansion, increased stress,\nand higher molecular motion that\nforces the polymer to relieve stress\nthrough molecular rearrangement.\nAging effects, which are time-dependent, result from molecular bonds\nbeing formed or broken. This response\nis of most concern for predicting longterm durability or service life.\nFor more information, contact Doug\nChirhart at Dyneon, a 3M Company; Tel:\n651-736-9241; or visit the Web site at:\nwww. dyneon. corn.\n\nI\n\nHAND-HELD CCD\nSPECTROMETERS\n\nNIR (2.9pm) Array\nSPECTROMETERS\n\nS Making Ion-Accelerator Grids From Ti\nInstead of Mo\nTitanium grids last longer, cost less, and have greater\nstrength/weight ratios.\nJohn H. Glenn Research Center, Cleveland, Ohio\nTitanium has been found to offer several advantages over molybdenum as the\nmaterial used to construct electrostaticaccelerator and -screen grids for ion\nthrusters for spacecraft. These advantages could also be expected to extend\nto the manufacture of grids for ion accelerators used in scientific research and\nthe fabrication of semiconductors.\nTitanium was chosen as the result of\na search for a grid material that is less\nvulnerable to sputter erosion and from\nwhich grids could be fabricated at acceptably low cost. At a given current\ndensity, the volumetric rate of sputter\nerosion of titanium is about half that of\nmolybdenum. Hence, in comparison\nwith a thruster containing molybdenum grids operating at a given beam\ncurrent density, a thruster of the same\nsize containing titanium grids can last\nabout twice as long; alternatively, the\nthruster containing titanium grids can\nlast about the same amount of time\nwhen operated at twice the beam current density. Similarly, accelerators\ncontaining titanium grids could he opcrated at higher voltages.\nThe strength-to-weight ratio of titanium exceeds that of molybdenum,\nmaking it possible to reduce the\nweights of ion accelerators. The substiNASA Tech Briet, August 2001 \t\n\ntution of titanium for molybdenum\ndoes not entail any increase in the\ncomplexity of ion-accelerator design.\nTitanium grids can be fabricated by\nuse of photochemical-etching and hydroform processes heretofore used to\nmake molybdenum grids for Glenn Research Center. Previousl y, attempts at\nphotochemical etching of titanium\nwere thwarted by the corrosion-resistant nature of titanium, but recent advances in photochemical etching have\novercome this obstacle.\nFinally, titanium offers the advantage\nof lower cost: at the time of reporting\nthe information for this article, the cost\nper unit weight of titanium was 43 percent less than that of molybdenum.\nThis work was (lone by Vincent K.\nRau\'lin of Glenn Research Center and\nGeorge C.

Johnson Space Gen ter Houston, Texas\nThe state of the art of pressure gauging has been advanced by the development of a new technique, and of a nonintrusive gauge based on the technique,\nfor measuring the pressure of a fluid in\nthe same segment of pipe in which the\nmass-flow rate of the fluid is also nieasured. NASA anticipates the first use of\nthe technique in support of the High\nFlow Test Facility at White Sands Test Facility. and Kennedy Space Center has expressed interest in appl ying the technique on the X-33 aerospace launch\nvehicle. Nonintnisive pressure and flow\ngauges based oil the present technique\ncould also supplant older pressure and\nflow gauges in a variety of commercial\nprocesses and pressure systems in which\nthe intrusion of gauges is known to affect\nlocal fluid dynamics.\nPrior flownieters and pressure gauges\nare subject to some limitations:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Frequently, pressure gauges of prior\ndesign are attached to the outside\nwalls of straight pipe segments, but intrusive wall taps are needed to couple\nfluid pressure to the transducers in the\ngauges. A wall tap can disturb the local\nflow profile and introduce fluid-entrapment zones and fluid-containment\nvolumes.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Straight-tube mass-flow meters of prior\ndesign do not measure pressures along\nwith mass-flow, rates.\nGauges for simultaneous measurement of pressure and flow rate would he\nuseful on NASA\'s space shuttle. An important consideration in the design of\nsuch gauges as retrofit items is that they\nare not allowed to intrude into the\nplumbing carrying the fluid to be\ngauged. Therefore, the present technique for measurement by an externally\nmounted, nonintrusive gauge was conceived. The technique offers the advantage of eliminating not onl y flow-disturbing intrusions into the plumbing but also\nthe complications associated with implementation of pressure taps.\nThe present technique involves the\nuse of a piezoelectric transmitting\ntransducer, mounted on the outside of\na fluid-filled pipe, to excite vibrations in\nthe pipe. The transducer is driven by a\nvoltage-tunable electronic power oscillator. A receiving transducer, also attached to the exterior surface of the\npipe, is used to measure the frequency\nand phase of the vibrations. An external phase-locked-loop control circuit\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 2001\t\n\nensures that the frequency of the power\noscillator automaticall y tracks the resonance frequency of the selected vibrational mode of the pipe. The frequency\noutput of the gauge can be coupled to\nexternal readout equipment by use of\nan optical fiber. The pressure of the\nfluid is then computed by use of the\nrrel at ion I e I wee ii the 11111(1 pressule\n\nand the resonance frequenc y (the pressure varies approximatel y linearly with\nthe frequency).\nBecause the only part of the gauge\nthat comes in contact with the fluid is\nthe pipe segment, which is already part\nof the plumbing, the nonintrusive pressure gauge can coexist with a mass-flow\ngauge tli,it utihies or is ITioulited in or\n\nIng\n\nNKK\'s liquid crystal smart switches could be\nthe brightest idea you ever had.They can be\nprogrammed to display numbers, characters,\n\nstill images and moving graphics.

Devised for original application to lightweight membrane structures in outer\nspace, the method can also be applied\non Earth to similar structures, to diverse\nindustrial products that include paper\nand textiles, and to structures made\nfrom these products.\nPVP is a variational principle, for\nwhich some of membrane strain components, unlike in a traditional variational\nprinciple, do not participate in functional variation.

Out-of-plane stiffness is usually\nimparted to a membrane through pretensioning. Therefore, out-of-plane stiffness is a function of the distribution of inplane stress. Wrinkles appear when some\nareas of a membrane are subjected to inplane compression to a certain level; indeed, the formation of wrinkles is a membrane local-buckling phenomenon.\nOrdinarystress analysis procedures\nare limited in predicting wrinkles. Numerical iteration methods for wrinkling\nanalysis used heretofore to analyze wrinkles apply different values of membrane\nmaterial properties, depending on\nwhether it is taut, slack, or wrinkled.\nThese methods often present difficulties\nthat prevent or impede convergence or\nthat lead to incorrect solutions.\nThe present PVP-MP method guarantees accurate results with much less (relative to prior methods) computational\neffort. The method involves two main\nsteps. In the first step, one develops a\nPVP principle, including a controlling\nparameter vector. With the help of the\ncontrolling parameter vector, taut, slack,\nand wrinkled states of the membrane\ncan he represented by one variational\nprinciple. In the second step, one\nsearches for the minimum of the variational principle by use of the applicable\noptimization technique. Because the\nsearch can reach the minimum of the\nvariational principle at the exact solution, this method can predict the distribution of stress throughout the membrane, including any taut, slack, and/or\nwrinkled areas.\nThis work was done by Houfei Fang,\nMichael Lou, and Bingen Yang of (altech\nfor NASA\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\nFor furt her information, access the Technical\nSupport Package (TSP) free on-line at wwu\nnasafech.com under the Mechanics category.\nAPO-21133\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 2001\n\ni.\nManufacturing/Fabrication\nDigital Preassembly Process\nAssembly of major elements of large structures is simulated in a CAD environment.\nLyndon B.

This methodology creates a simple numerical index for\nquantifying hazard severity. The index is\ntraceable to flight-level meteorology and\naircraft-specific, icing-induced reductions in aircraft performance. It also\nprovides a connection to a statistical\ndata base of icing meteorology. This system will clarify the terminology used to\ndescribe the degree of danger posed by\nspecific meteorological conditions. The\nrelationship between hazard severity\nand meteorology is related by measured\nice accumulation rates observed on a\nstandard airfoil under prescribed conditions. This system has greater fidelity\nthan the existing system and is applicable to all types of air vehicles.\nThe proposed numerical index is\nbased on a multidimensional matrix representation of meteorological parameters that pertain to icing. For example\n(see Figure 1), suppose that ice-accretion rates for a given aircraft could he\ndetermined from three parameters; the\noutside air temperature, the fraction of\ncloud water droplets with diameters\n>100 pm, and the liquid density (the vol-\n\ntime of water per unit \\olumc DI an)\nThe three-dimensional space for these\nthree parameters would be segmented\ninto cells, each representing a unique\nmeteorological state. Each cell could be\nassigned a probability of occurrence estimated from meteorological data bases.\nAircraft manufacturers would then he\nable to specify surfaces in the three-dimensional parameter space that bouiicl\nsafe operating conditions for each of\ntheir aircraft for various ranges of exposure times. Thus, the meteorological matrix concept would provide traceability\namong meteorological conditions, aircraft performance, and cumulative\nprobabilities of occurrence of icing.\nTo reference each level of the proposed index to the degree of hazard, the\nindex would he related to measured rates\nof ice accumulation on a standard wing\ncross section. The rates would he measured over a wide range of meteorological conditions for a standard set of flight\nconditions (such as airspeed and angle of\nattack). Aerodynamic modeling software\ncould then be used to translate the observed icing phenomena to commercial\nairfoil shapes with some confidence.\nThe proposed index would feature\nsome number of levels - possibly 12 Percentage of Droplets\nWith Diameters> 100- m\n\nSPACE 2001:\nThe Must-Attend Space\nConference of the Year\nThis is your chance to define our\nfuture in space.

The\nlevels would he assigned to cells in meteorological matrices (see Figure 2).\nThe twelve-level scale would be related\nto the present four-level system in the\nfollowing way: Zero would represent meteorological conditions that do not induce icing; three through six would correspond to the "light" level; seven\nthrough nine would correspond to the\npresent "moderate" level; and 10 to 12\nwould correspond to the present "severe" level.

The\nsystem would include a small tank of helium for initial inflation, plus a catalytic\nhydrazine gas generator that would supply makeup gas over the long term.\nAfter initial inflation, when makeup gas\nwas needed, liquid hydrazine from a\ntank would be made to pass through a\ncatalytic bed, where it would become\ndecomposed into a mixture of N9, H2,\nand a small amount of NH3- This\ngaseous mixture would constitute the\nmakeup gas and would be stored in the\ntank that previously contained the helium. The makeup gas would be released from the tank to the structure(s)\nas needed. In comparison with an inflation system based only on compressed\ngas stored in tanks, the proposed inflation system would offer the advantage of\nlower mass: About 25 percent of the\nmasses of representative previously contemplated large inflatable outer-space\nstructures would have been contained\nin their inflation systems. In contrast,\nthe mass of the proposed inflation system has been estimated to he only about\n13 percent of the total mass of a representative structure.\nThis work was done i\'v Larry Roe of Caltech for NASA\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. 7 o obtain a cops\' of the report, "System\nFor Initial Inflation and Replacement Gas\nFor Inflatable Space Structures," access the\nTechnical Support Package (TSP) free onine\nat wuruuiasatech.com under the Machinery\nAutomation category.\nNPO-20539\n\n$ Thermal Insulation Would\nUse CO 2 in the\nMartian Environment\nA report describes the development of\na lightweight thermal insulation system\nfor Martian surface applications.

(SRAC)\nLos Angeles, CA\n310-207-2800\nwwwcosmosm.com\nUnder contract to NASA\'s Jet Propulsion Lab, Alliance\nSpacesvstems Inc. (AS!) of Pasadena, CA (www.asi-space.com )\nis designing the robotic arm for the Mars Exploration Rover\n(MER) project, which will send twin rovers to Mars in 2003.\nThe five-degrees-of-freedom arm is one meter long with scientific instruments at the end. It has live actuators, moving joints,\nand conductor wires, and must meet requirements for stiffness\nand mass. AS! used COSMOS/Works software for stress analsis and mass minimization during the design process.\nJim Staats, ASI\'s chief engineer, noted that mass is the crucial component of any space mission. "You just can\'t get there\nfrom here if you can\'t get the mass within the envelope," he\nsaid. Because its protective aeroshell can hold onl y so much\nmass, the MER lander must be within limits. Other crucial factors are the extreme temperatures on Mars, ranging from\n-184\xc2\xb0F to \xc2\xb1176\xc2\xb0F, and the 50 to 60 mph impact of landing.\nEach of the two rovers will drive to its likely location, extend\nits mechanical arm, and hold its instruments near a rock. The\n\narm will rotate so each instrument can scan a specific spot in\nturn. The AS! team thought the integration of CAD and FEA\nwould save them time and effort. The team used SolidWorks\nFor design (CAL)) and COSMOS/Works for FEA. With the integration of the two, ASI engineers (lid not have to manipulate\nCAD data to get it into a form suitable for FEA. Data transfer\nis automatic and does not require a file export and import.\nThe result is iterations that take hours rather than clays.\nFor Free Info Circle No. 751 or\r\nEnter No. 751 at www.nasatech.com/rs\n\ncirinding Tool to Reveal\nMartian Rock\nRock Abrasion Tool (RAT)\nHoneybee Robotics, Ltd.\nNew York, NY\n212-966-0661\nwww.Hbrobotics.com\nHoneybee Robotics is designing and building a robotic precision grinding tool for the twin rovers slated for launch as\npart of the Mars Exploration Rover (MER) project in 2003.\nThe instrument is being created to bore into hard rock surfaces on the Martian landscape. By boring into the rock, the\nRAT will reveal fresh rock that will be analyzed by instruments\non the rover. This assists scientists studying Mars b y allowing\nthem to go beyond the weathered surface of the planet and\nexamine the contents of Martian rocks.\nThe RAT will he mounted on the rover\'s robotic arm, which\nwill position the RAT against a rock to let it operate. The RAT\nwill use low force and high speed to comply with the limited\npower supply available during the mission. The tool will he\nequipped with two diamond matrix wheels that it will use to\nscrape the rock surfaces.\nIn order to comply with NASA\'s regulations, the RAT will\nweigh less than 750 grams (roughly 1.7 pounds), be 7 cm (2.7\ninches) in diameter, and only 10 cm long (less than 4 inches).\n\n64\t\n\nBy using three small motors, the RAT will only use 30 watts of\nelectricity.
