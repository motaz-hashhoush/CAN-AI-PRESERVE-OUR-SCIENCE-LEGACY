The load limit value is fully adjustable by the operator and works independently of the test system control as a mechanical (non-electrical) device. When a test specimen is loaded via an electromechanical or hydraulic test system, a chance of an overload condition exists. An overload applied to a specimen could result in irreparable damage to the specimen and/or fixturing. The FLS restricts the maximum load that an actuator can apply to a test specimen. When testing limited-run test articles or using very expensive fixtures, the use of such a device is highly recommended. Test setups typically use electronic peak protection, which can be the source of overload due to malfunctioning components or the inability to react quickly enough to load spikes. The FLS works independently of the electronic overload protection.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 20120000476, "id": "cb6d4ad77c6944fca150abd828fc27d7", "publicationName": "NASA Tech Briefs, September 2011", "publicationDate": "2011-09-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 20120000420, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "NASA Tech Briefs, September 2011", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20120000476.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20120000476/downloads/20120000476.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20120000476/downloads/20120000476.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20120000476/downloads/20120000476.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
