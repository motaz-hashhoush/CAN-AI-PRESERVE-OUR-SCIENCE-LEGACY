This study examined the anomalies for each mission maintained for NASA at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. By examining the anomalies each mission encountered during their multiyear missions, trends were identified related to when anomalies occurred during each mission, the types of anomalies encountered, and corrective actions taken to mitigate the effects of the anomalies. As has been discovered in previous studies the numbers of anomalies directly correlate with mission activity and show a decreasing trend with elapsed mission time. Trend analysis also identified a heavy emphasis on software as the source or solution to anomalies for both missions.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20090035736, "endDate": "2008-01-10T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Inst. of Aeronautics and Astronautics", "location": "Reston, VA, United States"}}, "meetingId": "0435da338af548e2840a54d67d2e9bed", "id": "4730726340324dca9a136c1bf5f51a92"}], "name": "46th AIAA Aerospace Sciences Meeting and Exhibit", "location": "Reno, NV", "id": "0435da338af548e2840a54d67d2e9bed", "startDate": "2008-01-07T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20090035736, "id": "50afb2ada6784769a99e1c41b2b86e1b", "publicationDate": "2008-01-07T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
