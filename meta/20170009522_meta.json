The three-dimensional arrangement of the first alloy composition is infused with at least a second alloy composition, where the second alloy composition comprises a shape memory alloy. The three-dimensional arrangement is consolidated into a fully dense solid structure, and the original shape of the second alloy composition is set for reversible transformation. Strain is applied to the fully dense solid structure, which is treated with heat so that the shape memory alloy composition becomes memory activated to recover the original shape. An interwoven composite of the first alloy composition and the memory-activated second alloy composition is thereby formed in the multiple alloy composite structure.", "title": "Functionally Graded Metal-Metal Composite Structures", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2017-10-04T17:16:14.4300000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20170009522, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Brice, Craig A."}, "organization": {}}, "id": "f10adb073c29458787aba95b42eace6f"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other - Patent", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "id": 20170009522, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20170009522, "id": "845242866f7f452bb23fc785b5143811", "publicationDate": "2017-09-19T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20170009522.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20170009522/downloads/20170009522.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20170009522/downloads/20170009522.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20170009522/downloads/20170009522.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
