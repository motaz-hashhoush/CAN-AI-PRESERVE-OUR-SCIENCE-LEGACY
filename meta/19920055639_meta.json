Operational cost drivers at the launch site are identified by examining Shuttle operational data collected over the past two and a half years, and arguments are presented for incorporating support and maintainability criteria in the design process. It is also shown that the increased application of automation to evaluate systems and conduct operations will provide ways to reduce launch operations costs in addition to other benefits, such as increasing the speed of the total checkout, reducing manpower requirements, reducing the possibility of human error, and minimizing documentation changes.", "title": "Design the support rather than support the design", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-15T15:25:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19920055639, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Scholz, Arthur L."}, "organization": {"name": "Boeing Aerospace and Electronics", "location": "Cocoa Beach, FL, United States"}}, "id": "2203add5c8f74cfea84927020083b4f0"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19920055639, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Dickinson, William J."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Kennedy Space Center", "location": "Cocoa Beach, FL, United States"}}, "id": "76852a7151c549b087cc13a577b77e5b"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-19T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 19920055639, "endDate": "1989-04-28T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "Canaveral Council of Technical Societies"}}, "meetingId": "10036f501dc7424ca1e2e9eeffac027e", "id": "c434d8113dba4a35b72ae18dd89dde73"}], "name": "Space Congress", "location": "Cocoa Beach, FL", "id": "10036f501dc7424ca1e2e9eeffac027e", "startDate": "1989-04-25T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "id": 19920055639, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19920055639, "id": "46db9fb7ceb445a4bb28c77856bbdffb", "publicationDate": "1989-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
