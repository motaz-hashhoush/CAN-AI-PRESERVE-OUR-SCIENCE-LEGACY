Affordable and high-quality Earth surface\ndata on demand is offered by TerraPoint\xe2\x84\xa2, LLC, of\nThe Woodlands, Texas.\nTerraPoint\xe2\x84\xa2, a business unit of Transamerica\nReal Estate Information Companies (TREIC),\ncombines the business of providing topographic\nmapping services with the capability of NASA laser\ntechnology.\nTerraPoint\xe2\x84\xa2 is marketing laser-generated digital,\ntopographic data that can be obtained in a range of\nday/night, weather, and vegetation conditions. At the\nheart of this commercial service is laser technology\nsponsored by Goddard Space Flight Center\xe2\x80\x99s\nTechnology Commercialization Office. This transfer\nof technology is the culmination of over 20 years of\nNASA research activities.\nTerraPoint\xe2\x84\xa2 is headquartered on the Houston\nAdvanced Research Center (HARC) campus in The\nWoodlands, Texas. The company has exclusive access\nto patented NASA optical technology for terrain\nmapping applications. TerraPoint\xe2\x84\xa2 is also integrating this technology into new airborne sensor designs,\nfurther improving the quality of the terrain products\nwhile continuing to drive down costs.\nTREIC is a division of Fortune 500 Transamerica\nCorporation, one of the nation\xe2\x80\x99s largest financial\nservices companies. Comprising four business units\nand headquartered in Dallas, Texas, TREIC provides\nproperty tax services, flood zone determinations, and\ndetailed information on residential properties. With\nTerraPoint\xe2\x84\xa2 added as a TREIC business unit, Earth\nsurface data on demand is now offered to customers.\nThis fusion of application and capabilities,\nbusiness savvy, and space technologies also culminated in a melding of laser ranging and Global\nPositioning System (GPS) satellite hardware, replete\nwith mapping software\xe2\x80\x94all brought together in a\nminiaturized package that can be mounted in a light\naircraft.\nTerraPoint\xe2\x84\xa2\xe2\x80\x99s Light Detection and Ranging\n(LIDAR) System capability has already been utilized\nin the largest high-resolution digital terrain mapping\neffort, scanning more than 1,700 square miles of\nHarris County, Texas. Harris County includes the\nnation\xe2\x80\x99s fourth biggest city, Houston. The result was\nover 275,000 precise terrain data points per square\n\nTerraPointTM has exclusive access to patented NASA\noptical technology for terrain mapping applications.\nmile, with a vertical accuracy on the order of one\nfoot.\nTerraPoint\xe2\x84\xa2 is committed to flying over the\nmajor U.S. metropolitan areas, and will offer off-theshelf digital terrain data at prices meeting the\nbudgetary needs of the industry.\nThe potential commercial customer base is\nextensive, given high-density and fast-turnaround\ndata of the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s surface that are produced in a\ncost-effective manner. By introducing laser mapping,\nTerraPoint\xe2\x84\xa2 offers 3-D data that are ideal for\ncharting flood plains, surveying pipeline routes,\nconducting highway design and planning simulations, placing communication antennas in a city,\nconducting shoreline and erosion surveys, acquiring\nriver cross sections for hydrologic modeling, and\nassessing forest habitats.\nTopographic data generated using laser technology are superior to those provided by traditional\ntechnologies, specifically the more commonly used\nradar and photographic technologies, says Dan\nCotter, president of business development for\nTerraPoint\xe2\x84\xa2. \xe2\x80\x9cThe technology permits 3-D\nmapping of cities, something not considered cost\neffective, that is until the introduction of\nTerraPoint\xe2\x84\xa2,\xe2\x80\x9d Cotter adds.\nTerraPointTM is a trademark of TerraPoint, LLC\n\nEnvironment and Resources Management\n\n63\n\n'
