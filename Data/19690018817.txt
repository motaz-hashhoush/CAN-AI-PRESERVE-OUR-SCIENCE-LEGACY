Is it possible to evaluate, generally, the practical benefits of\nutilizing AES* in long-range communications?\n\nD\n\nA technico-economic analysis indicates that it is economically practical to utilize AES communications systems to transmit information\nseveral thousands of kilometers away. This is very important for a\ncountry as large as ours whose territories are so extensive and often\nfi h\nso thinly populated.\nImagine how difficult and expensive it is to construct long-range cable\nand relay communications. Each such system, containing many intermediate transmitting stations, demands receiving and transmitting equipment buildings, power sources, and maintenance. In remote areas and\nthose areas with small populations, this is especially difficult.After\nebing constructed, these communications systems can only be put into\noperation after all the intermediate and final links have been built.\nGround receiving stations for space communications are independent of\neach other; e.g., as during the development of the "Orbit" system.\n\'They are especially effective economically in so far as their-construc\ntion . and application to exploiting new receiving stations is not connected with increased costs for additional-satellites or transmitting\ncenters.\nThere is another important factor which cannot be subjected to any\'financial criteria but which is essential to all activities of our sottialist governments the constant concern to better the existence of every\nSoviet citizen and to satisfy his increasing material and spiritual\nneeds.\n\nY\n\nIn order to carry out "Directive XXIII" of the KPSS ** released on the\neve of the 30th anniversary celebration of the " Great October ( revolution)\na wide network system was constructed through the " Orbit" system throughout the distant regions of our country. As a result, 20 million more\n\xe2\x80\xa2_ peorle were given access to central television.\nyI\n\nAES 003 (artificial earth satellites)\n* *KPSS : Mcc , (Communist Party ^ of the Soviet Onion)\n\n\'1\n\n\t\n\nY\n\nI\nIt would have been impossible to construct such vast networks in\nsuch distant parts of the Far North and Far East in so brief a period without the AES. How can we measure the joy of these people\nand their graditude to the party and government.\nFrom a large volume of telegrams, received from viewers and public\norganizations apropos,of the establishment of the "Orbit" station, I\nwould like to read just one from the city of Kemerov: "The television\ntransmission from Moscow on the occaision of the 50th anniversary of\nthe "Great October (revolution)", once again demonstarted to all the\nworkers at Kuzbass the invaluable contributions made by Soviet scientists. Three million workers were thrilled when they saw the grand\nmeeting of the Central Committee of the KPSS and the Supreme Soviet\nof the USSR, the meets at Marx Field, the parade at Red Square, and\nthe sports events.\n"The content of the televized programs was interesting and the quality\nexcellent because everyone felt that he was participating in events of\nhistorical importance. The Division of the KPSS here heartily congratualates the designers of "Orbit" for their magnificent gift to\nthe workers..."\nThe construction and activation of 20 "Orbit" stations within a year\nis a monumental acheivement and marks our transition to the mass\nutilization of space technology in our national economy and underscores the acheivements of our national science, technology, and industry.\n2. How will space long-range communications systems be developed in\nthe future when the Molniya satellite is used?\nEngineers and scientists of all types are working in design bureaus\nand scientific-research institutes to improve the economical and functional aspects of space communications systems. They develop new elements of various devices and perfect ground receiving stations.\n\n`\t\n\nRegular communications satellites are being prepared for orbital flight\nto ensure normal functioning of already existing space communications\nsystems and to improve them. New "Orbit" stations are being built to\nreceive programs from central television and their further expansion\nis being considered. Besides,the "Orbit" stations will help realize\nlocal television transmission, and telephone, telegraph, and phototelegraphic.communications. \t\nSpace communications systems will also\nbe applied in transmitting weather reports and matrixes of central newspapers.\nThe role of space communications systems must not be underrated in the\nrealization of widespread color transmission in our country. A decision\nto install the Soviet-French color TV system SeaomIII was made in July\n1966 which would also ensure the reception of color programs on regular\nblack and whi-e TV and vice-versa. All areas receiving satellite-transmitted television will be able to receive color television.\n\n2\n\n0\n\nThe utilization of space systems opens up all kinds of possibilities\nto establish international space communications systems. Agreement\nbetween many socialist countries regarding mutual establishment of\nspace communications systems leads to the possibility of constructing\nstations not only in our territory but in other countries as well.\n3. What new problemA in the area of communications can be made incumbent on satellites in the future?\n\nCommunications systems that utilize satellites will play a leading\nrole in securing international communications and eventually in the\nestablishment\'of global systems of radio-space communications. Not\nonly communications between ground stations will be secured but also\nbetween moving objects ... planes and ships located anywhere.\nAn AES communications system will ensure reception of radio broadcasting\nand television directly to radio and TV receivers of viewers and listeners=\nafter certain technical problems have been solved. Any point on earth\nwill become as assured zone of TV reception and the television receiver\nwill become as omnipresent as is the transistor radio.\n\n'
