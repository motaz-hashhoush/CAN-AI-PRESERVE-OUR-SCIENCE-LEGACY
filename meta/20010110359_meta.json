Several points are made concerning the subject. In order for ITS to be successful, it must be supported by management. NASA, while required by law to keep the public informed of its pursuits, must take precautions due to possible IT-based incursions by computer hackers and other malignant persons. Fear is an excellent motivation for establishing and maintaining a robust ITS policy. The ways in which NASA ITS personnel continually increase security are manifold, however a great deal relies upon the active involvement of the entire NASA community.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "Australia", "submissionId": 20010110359, "endDate": "2001-02-27T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "ICM Conference", "location": "Sydney", "id": "3eb2948c4e74414ebc807af7cef5be7c", "startDate": "2001-02-26T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20010110359, "id": "fff1fc26cf5c4d2c906ffa2b3c37c4c7", "publicationDate": "2001-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20010110359.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20010110359/downloads/20010110359.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20010110359/downloads/20010110359.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20010110359/downloads/20010110359.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
