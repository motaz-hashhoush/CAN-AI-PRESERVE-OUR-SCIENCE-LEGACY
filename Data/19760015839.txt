This unit was to be used in the\nevaluation of techniques for implementing operational instrumentation,\ndata processing and ground checkout operations.\nThe CDU was to be designed to provide, to the greatest extent possible,\nthe following:\n1. )\t\n\nMaximum Shuttle compatibility.\n\n2.)\n\nA data bus terminal which is configurable, via the use of\na basic set of plug-in interface modules, to satisfy various\ndata acquisition and command stimuli requirements of the\nShuttle avionics subsystems.\n\n3.)\n\nA basic set of subsystem interface modules which provide\ninput/output signal conditioning to satisfy subsystem\nsensor interface requirem( its.\n\n4.)\n\nA data bus tr :tnsmission system design which satisfies the\ndata transfer requirements of Shuttle instrumentation,\ndata processing and ground checkout systems.\n\n5.)\n\nA design using off-the-shelf hardware where possible.\n\nThe following background information was provided:\n"The Space Shuttle data processing and instrumentation subsystems utilize remote data terminals to both acquire data\nfrom and distribute data to vehicle subsystems for flight\ncontrol, performance monitoring and recording, pre-launch\n\n3\n\n^\t\n\ne\n\ncheckout, and other functions. These terminals both receive\nand respond to commands sent from the controlling system\nhardware (avionics computers, PCM telemetry equipment,\nground checkout computers) over serial data busses. These\ndata busses substantially reduce vehicle wiring by utilizing\ntime division multiplexing and pulse code modulation techniques to transfer data between the remote terminals and the\ncommand generators.\nThe advantages of using common hardware elements for implementation of these remote terminals is obvious and the\nc r,ncept of using remote terminal equipment, which is configurable to meet the specific input/output requirements of\nany su7% l ystem interface, has been proposed for the Shuttle.\nThe availability of system elements capable of meeting these\ngoals should be determined and a typical system comprised\nof these units acquired for integration into the Shuttle Avionics \t\nIntegration Laboratory. This will allow evaluation of these\nunits prior to the finalization of the Shuttle Avionics design,\nand identification of the modifications required to adapt these\nunits to the Shuttle.\'\'\nDESIGN STUDIES\n\nThe design studies outlined in the original contract called for the development of alternative approaches or concepts and an evaluation of\nthe feasibility of these approaches. Preliminary specifications were\nto be prepared incorporating the chosen approaches.\nThe basic CDU requirements, as defined in section 3.3. 1 of the NASA\nStatement of Work dated January 19, 1973, were expanded and updated\n\n4\t\nf\n\n1\'l1L\nRI?PItJUIiC\'ll;ll,ll\'; \t\nUIcIC INAL PAWL\' h, PWli\n\nII I\n\nir\n\nto incorporate existing hardware specifications where this was found\nto be the most satisfactory approach. The Data Bus Coupler (DBC)\nand the Serial Digital Input/Output (SD I/O) requirements were updated\nto incorporate the design study results, latest Shuttle requirements and\nNASA- JSC recommendations. This change was incorporated into the\ncontract as part of Change No. 2 dated 8 November 1973, which also\ndeleted most of the formal design study reporting requirements.\nTwo design study reports were submitted to NASA as required by contract Change No. 2. These were "A Data Bus Coupler Design" and "A\nSerial Input/Output Mechanication." The results of both of these study\ndocuments were reflected in the delivered hardware.\nThe first report, "A Data Bus Coupler Design", outlines the DBC requirements, defines the data bus and then presents the design that resulted after an extensive period of breadboarding and laboratory evaluation.\nProbably the most important part of the DBC design was the receiver\ninput circuitry. Here, a balanced transformer-coupled input was used\nfollowed by a pair of symmetrical hot carrier diode clippers. A series\nresistor-capacitor network was used between transformer secondary\nand the diode pair. The capacitor value was chosen to be approximately\nequal to the diode capacitance, further improving noise performance\nunder weak signal conditions. The output from the diode clipper was\nampliiied by a high gain high slew rate operational amplifier, filtered\nby a low-pass filter and again passed through a symmetrical clipper.\nThis processing caused any transitions to appear as short duration signals, minimizing detection circuitry interference by noise.\n\n5\n\n_\n\nBrea;:board tests were performed on the receiver circuitry and an error rate of less than 1 in 10 8 was detected while operating with a 14 db\nsignal to noise ratio using 0 - 4 MHz bandwidth gaussian noise.\nThe report included a Data Bus Coupler Specification in Appendix "A".\nAssembly drawings, schematics and interconnect drawings were ineluded in Appendix "B".\nThe second report, "A Serial Input/Output Mechanization" defined a\nmeans of acquiring or disseminating serial digital data over dedicated\nlines. The approach used in this report took advantage of most of the\ncircuitry developed for use in the DBC. Because several Serial I/O\nModule;; could be used in a single CDU, the serial channel implementation i.sed two separate modules. One module contained the common\ncircuitry and the second module was designed as a four channel multiplexer for the first one. The same transformers, receiver circuitry\nand sync detection circuitry as used in the DBC are used in this design.\nInterface signals are defined. Timing diagrams, block diagrams and\ndetailed theory of operation are included in the report. Schematics,\noutline and Assembly drawings are included in Appendix "A\nCDU DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT\nGeneral\nThe CDU specification, as incorporated by Change No. 2 dated 8\nNovember 1973, defined a unit which contained removable Input/Output\n(I/0) modules. A basic CDU housing with associated power supply,\nData Bus Coupler and various other "overhead" modules could be operated as a single unit or it could be operated back-to-back in a fully\n\nRr^l^lt^ \xe2\x96\xba l^u^ll.^i .rr ^: ,)l^ ^fHl;\n6\t\n\nUlW_ NAL PAU"\n\nredundant mode. See Figure 1 for a simplified block diagram. Each\nside of the redundant CDU could be controlled via its own DBC module\nand, as such, could control the I/O modules in both sides.\nInput/Output Cards\nThe basic I/O modules and the module addressing scheine were taken\nfrom an existing Teledyne AIFTDS-4000 Remote Multiplexer/Demultiplexer Unit (RMDU) design. The Anr..log Multiplexer Card (AMX) and\nthe D.C. Bridge Multiplexer Card (D: BRIDGE) designs were used\nwithout redesign.\nThe Analog Output Card (AO:.) design was modified slightly by addition\nof C-MOS data registers to prevent loss of data during short duration\npower interruptions. The analog output buffers were also improved by\nadding current limiting and overvoltage protection.\nThe Discrete Multiplexer Cards (DMX) were modified by the addition\nof optical isolators and a floating power supply to provide floating inputs. C-MOS storage registers we . . ,Iso added to these units to\nprovide memory during short power interruptions.\nThe Discrete Output Cards (DOC) were designed for the Shuttle requirements. The card addressing philosophy was already established for\nthe other cards. The new design effort involved taking the two stored\n16 bit digital words and providing an individual floating solid state\nswitch contact for each bit. Two types of units were required - one\nfor use in 5 volt applications where the switch would interface %%ith TTL\nlogic and the other for use in sNvitching 28 volt DC loads. Optical\ncouplers were used in each design to provide D.C. isolation. Asi isolated\n6 VDC supply was used to provide power tc the output circuitry in the\ni\n7\n\n3\t\n\nI\n\nt\n\n^\t\n\nt t\n\nr\t\n\n^\n\na\n\nI\n\n^^ I J^^\t\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\n^\n\nI\nI\n\nI\nI\n\nI\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nE\n\nto\n\nw\n\nbn\n\n^S\n\nx\nu\n\'\nI\nI\t\nI\t\n\n^\t\n<\n\n^\n\ng\ta\nu\n\n^ti\n\xc2\xb0z=\n\n^\n\n^\t\n\n0\n\n^^I\ngal\n\nI\n\n^\n\nZ\t\n<\n\nI\n\na\n\nI\t\n\nu\t\n\ng\t\n^\t\n\nI\n\n^\n\n^\na\n\nI\t\nI\t\n\nI\n\nU\n\nI\nI.\n\n=\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nu\t\n\n^7^\'^\t\n\nA\n\n6\t\nI\n\n^^\nw\n\n3\t\n\n0\nOb\n\nI\n\n1\n\nI\n\nL7T\n\nI\n\nw\n\nLlrL-- --^---- -- --,\nJ\t\n\nr-\n\nI\n\n<Z\t\ni\'\t\n\niZ\t\n\nv^,\t\n\nVz\n\nbz\t\n\nb-\n\n0\n\nby\n\nI\n\nLe\nI\n\nftlh:\n8\n\nTTL-compatible circuit. The 28 volt output switch is powered from\nan external power source so additional isolated power was not required.\nThese circuits were packaged as the 5 volt DOC, Part No. 839500, and\nthe 28 volt DOC, Part No. 839503, respectively.\nThe Serial Input/Output card was designed in accordance with the\nsecond design study report. It used receiver and transmitter transformers that were designed for the Data Bus Coupler. The circuitry\nfor use in driving the dedicated lines was also the same as used in the\nDBC. The Serial I/O was packaged in a standard I/O card configuration.\nIt is addressed as a four channel input-output multiplexer for the St\xc2\xad ial\nDigital Interface (SDI) Module in the CDU "overhead" section.\nOverhead ^.Ic , lules\n\nReferring ::ack to Figure 1, the "overhead" modules are the ADP-M,\nDDP-M, DBC, BITE Computer, Serial Digital Interface Module and\nthe Power Supply. These modules are required to operate any combi\nnation of up to 16 IN modules. They were designed and packaged in a\nmodular housing. Each "overhead" module is packaged as a removable\naseembly to simplify troubleshooting and maintenance. Identical overhead modules are used in each half of the redundant CDU housing.\nThe Analog Data Processor Module (ADP-NI) was simila. to the un.being used in the Teledyr^ RMDU. The unit was re-packaged on a\nslightly larger printed wiring card to be compatible with the other cards\nin the CDU. A small reed relay was added in series -with the analog\ndata bus to physically disconnect the card from the analog bus when the\ncard is not in use. This was done to prevent a shor \xe2\x96\xba ed input on one\nADP-M from disabling the\n\nentir.? CDU by shurting out all analog data.\n\n9\n\n.\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThe Digital Data Processor Module (DDP-M) was designed to interface\nwith the DBC and convert data bus address information into CDU card\n-1\t\n\nslot, channel address and ADP-M gain. The card slot, channel address format and ADP-M gain format was taken from the existing\nTeledyne RMDU design. Erasable E-PROMS were used to store the\ntable of card and channel addresses for each DBC line address. The\nunit was designed, breadboarded and tested as part of this contract.\nThe final circuitry was packaged on the appropriate size printed circuit cards for use in the CDU.\nThe DBC was designed and tested as defined in the first study report.\nThe completed circuitry was packaged on four printed circuit cards.\nOne card was used as the main connection to the CDU and all other\ncards were then interconnected via Kapton coated flexible printed\nwiring cables. All cards were fastened together to form a single plugin module.\nThe BITE Computer was designed for use in the CDU. It is a special\npurpose digital computer capable of performing real time in-flight tests\nand does not require initiation by the computer. It generates the CAL/\nBITE channel address and the proper gain where required, stores the\nHi/Lo limits for the selected CAL/BITE data, tests itself and stores\nthe results. The contents of the BITE Status Register are available to\nthe computer by request via the DBC. The BITE Bit assignments are\nshown in Table 1 .\nBB5 to BB20 are from the low level calibration (LLC) of each analog\ninput card so each bit indicates whether the corresponding LLC is\nwithin the specified tolerance. These bits are summed through 16 input NAND gates. If any one of 16 I/O cards fail, binary level "1"\n\n10\n\ni\n.J\t\n\n--\t\n\n-\t\n\n^. \t\n\n.....\n\nt\t\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 .a\n\nTable I\n\n.a\n\nBITE Bit Assignments\n\nBit Assignments In\ndddressa^le Latch\t\n\nBB\t\n\nI\n\nPower Supply BITE Statue\n\n2\n]\n4\n\nRITE Statue Register Format\n\n)ILC\nCPA -0.

This information is then\nsent to the computer as part of the BITE status word.\nThe unit was designed with electrically programmable silicon gate\nMOS (E-PROM) memory devices. These are used to store high-low\nlimits for the various parameters being checked by the BITE Computer.\nThey may be erased and the limits changed in approximately 2 minutes,\nThe procedure was outlined in the CDU Operation and Maintenance\nManual.\nThe BITE Computer was packaged as a two card module. The first card\nconnects to the CDU via a 160 pin connector and contains all memory\ndevices, The second card is installed behind the first and connects to\nit by use of a Kapton printed wiring cable. The cards are fastened together to form a single module.\n\nit\n\nr\n\n^t\n\nThe Serial Digital Interface Module (SDI) was designed and tested as defined in the second study report. The SDI circuitry was taken from the\nDBC design where functional requirements were compatible. The entire input-sync detection section was used from the DBC and the output\ndriver circuitry was also found satisfactory.\nThe completed unit was packaged in a two card module where one card\nwas fitted with a 160 pin connector to connect to the CDU wiring and the\nsecond card was connected by Kapton cable to the first. When bolted\ntogether, the unit becomes a single removable module.\nThe *CDU operates from two separate power busses when in the redundant\nmode. The unit must function properly if either power bus fails. Therefore, a separate power supply is provided in each half of the redundant\nCDU. The power supply was designed to meet the redundancy and faultisolation requirements of the CDU specification. When both power busses\nare being used, the outputs of the two supplies are in parallel. Both\nsupplies are then synchronized from the same external clock.\nEach power supply consists of two sections, an inverter assembly and a\nregulator assembly. The inverter section contains the transistorized\nchopper, power transformers and rectifier circuitry required to generate the DC voltages necessary to operate the CDU. The regulator\nportion contains a synchronous pulse width regulator designed to efficiently produce a regulated DC voltage capable of powering a transistorized inverter. The overall supply consists of a case containing two\nplug-in printed wiring cards and a separate heat sink assembly which\nconnects to the rest of the power supply by separate cable. This heat\nsink assembly contains chopper transistors and series regulator switch.\nA printed wiring board is attached to the assembly and contains the\nassociated circuitry.\n\n12\n\nJ\n\nt\n\nA considerable amount of system check-out time was required to identify\nand eliminate power supply switching transient noise that caused errors\nin the sample-and-hold circuitry and the analog to digital converter on\nthe ADP-M. It became necessary to inhibit both regulator and chopper\nswitching during the analog conversion time. It was also found that the\ntransformers and other magnetics were easily saturated due to unsymmetrical waveforms caused by simply inhibiting the switching process during conversion. In order to prevent this problem, an UP-DOWN\nCounter was used to count the 4 MHz CDU clock. When the power supply\nclock is inhibited for an analog conversion, the counter counts up once\nfor each pulse received. After conversion and the first transition, the\ncounter must count down to zero before the power supply resumes its\nnormal operation. Thus, a single symnic\'crical cycle of a longer period\nhas been produced by the chopper and no transitions took place during\nanalog conversion. This solved the noise problems in the CDU and all\nunits were modified to include this circuitry.\nThe power supply was designed with a minimum of filtering in the basic\npower supply. Additionally, ceramic capacitors were used to minimize\nthe probability of catastrophic shorts. Most of the filtering was placed\non each individual circuit card where a fuse was installed between\ntantalum capacitor and the power supply. In this way, should a filter\nshort or a catastrophic short occur on any card, the fuse would blow,\nclearing the voltage bus.\nIt was found that the above filtering approach allowed excessive transients in certain power supply lines. Also, as I/O card complements\nwere changed, the amount of card filtering increased or decreased,\nchanging the ripple on some supply voltages. In order to reduce the\nabove problems, 1 U f ceramic capacitors were installed in each half\n\n13\n\nof the CDU on a terminal board (TB1) in the main housing where the\nflexible cables and bus bars were connected to the power supply connector wiring. This added sufficient capacity to reduce noise pick-up\non the flexible cables and helped to reduce ripple variations. Overall\nperformance and analog stability in particular were improved by this\nchange. All units were modified by addition of this filtering.\nPackaging\nThe CDU packaging approach is best understood by referring to Figure\n2, an exploded view of the CDU. Each half of the overall redundant\nCDU contains individual plug-in modules. The first eight card slots\nbehind the front panel connectors are for Input/Output cards. Each\ncard slot has a dedicated connector on the front panel and will accept\nany of the different types of I/C modules. The Data Bus Coupler and\nthe other "overhead" modules are installed in their respective slots\nbehind the I/O cards. The power supply is mounted in a shielded compartment at the rear of the unit. Printed wiring cables and heavy bus\nbars run the full length of the card connectors and provide all intercard connections. In the redundant mode, control signals, power supply\noutputs, etc. , are properly connected via interface connectors in the\nbase of each unit. A photograph of the completed CDU is shown in\nFigure 3.\nTesting\nI\n\nA test plan was prepared and submitted to NASA for review, as required.\nProduction test procedures and production test fixtures were prepared\nto provide uniform testing of the various modules. A system Acceptance\nTest Procedure was also generated and submitted to NASA. All five\nCDU\'s were tested in accordance with this test procedure. A test report was prepared and submitted for each individual unit that was shipped,\nby serial number.\n14\n\nif\n\n\t\n\nt\n\np\t\n\n\\\n\nb\nu\n\nL\n\nII\n\n7 p\nu b\n^G\nlbz\n\nE\n\n^^\t\n\n4\nD\nO\nW\nZ\nZ\n\nem\n.\n\n^\xe2\x80\x94\n\nQ\t\n\nH\nZ\n\nz\t\n\nO\n/\t\n\n1\\\n^w\n333 v\n\n1\t\n\nIM\n\nb\n\n\\\t\n\nF2\n\n5^/\nO\nu\n\nFigure 2.

A Data Bus Coupler test set\n(Teledyne Part No. 839753) was designed to exercise the DBC and the\nSerial Digital Input/Output cards. The tester could generate all the\nnecessary commands, receive and store the responses from the DBC\nI\n\nand detect various message errors. An operators manual was prepared. It contained schematics, copies of the various test procedures\nwhich require use of the test set and a brief theory of operation section.\nThe second piece of special test equipment was a Special Stimulus Test\nSet (Teledyne Part No. 840520). This was capable of exercising each\ntype of I/O module. An operators manual was also prepared for this\nunit.\nBoth of these pieces of special test equipment were retained at Teledyne\nfor use in testing CDU\'s on NASA Contract NAS9 -1381 3, which was for \t\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nadditional C DU\'s. A 300 foot data bus simulator (Teledyne Part No.\n839929) was also built and used for system tests. It was also retained\nfor use on the second contract.\nDocumentation\nAn Operation and Maintenance Manual was prepared under this contract\nfor the CDU. The manual was divided into\n\ntwo volumes. Volume 1\n\ncontains information relative to the basic CDU. It covers the housing,\npower supply and all \'\'overhead\'\' modules. A brief chapter on field repair and maintenance is also included.
