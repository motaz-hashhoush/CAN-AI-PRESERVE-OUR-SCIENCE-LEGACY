b'Network Coordinator\n\nNVI, Inc./GSFC\n\nNetwork Coordinator Report\nEd Himwich\nAbstract\nThis report includes an assessment of the network performance in terms of the yield of usable data\nover a 12 month period. A table of relative incidence of problems with various subsystems is presented.\nThe current situation for the handlng of correlator clock adjustments by the correlators is reviewed.\n\n1. Network Performance\nThe network performance report is based on correlator reports for sessions in calendar year\n2003. As of the date this report was generated, 188 sessions had been processed. There are another\n24 sessions from the calendar year that had not been processed yet, or the correlator results were\nnot available. Most of the missing sessions are from the latter part of the year and/or are waiting\nfor tapes from Antarctica before they can be processed. Roughly 85%-90%of the scheduled station\ndays are accounted for.\nAn important point to understand is that in this report the data loss is expressed in terms of\nlost observing time. This is straightforward in cases where operations were interrupted or missed.\nHowever in other cases, it can be more difficult to calculate. To do this a non-observing time\nloss is typically converted into an equivalent lost observing time. As an example a warm receiver\nwill greatly reduce the sensitivity of a telescope. The resulting performance will be in some sense\nequivalent to the station having a cold receiver but observing for (typically) only one-third of the\nnominal time. In a similar fashion, poor pointing is converted into an equivalent lost sensitivity.\nPoor playback is expressed as the fraction of total recorded bits lost.\nFrom the correlator reports, an attempt is made to determine how much observing time was\nlost at each station. This is not always straightforward to do. Sometimes the correlator notes\ndo not indicate that a station had a particular problem while the quality code summary will\nindicate a significant loss. Reconstructing which station or stations had problems and why in\nthese circumstances does not always yield accurate results. Another problem is that it is hard to\ndetermine how much RFI affected the data unless one or more channels were removed and that\neliminated the problem. Similar problems occur for intermittent poor playback. For individual\nstation days, the results should probably not be assumed to be accurate at better than the 5%\nlevel.\nThe results here should not viewed as an absolute evaluation for the quality of each station\xe2\x80\x99s\nperformance. As mentioned above the results themselves are only approximate. In addition, some\nproblems are beyond the control of the station, such as weather and power failures. Instead the\nresults should be viewed in aggregate as an overall evaluation of how much of the data the network\nis collecting as a whole. Development of the overall result is organized around individual station\nperformance, but the results for individual stations are noisy.\nSince stations typically observe with more than one other station at a time, the lost observing\ntime per station is not equal to the overall loss of VLBI data. Under some simplifyingassumptions,\nthe loss of VLBI data is roughly about twice the loss of observing time. The argument that supports\nthis has been described in previous years\xe2\x80\x99 versions of this report.\n\n18\n\nIVS 2003 Annual Report\n\nNVI, Inc./GSFC\n\nNetwork Coordinator\n\nFor the 188 sessions with results available from 2003, there are 1040 station days or almost\nG stations per session on average. Of these session days about 14.2% (or about 148 days) of the\n\nt\n\nobserving time was lost. For comparison, the results for 2002 were about 12.2%, for 2001 about\n11.6%, and for a subset of 1999-2000 the results were about 11.8%.\nThe observing time lost for 2003 is somewhat worse than previous yeam which were more\ntypically around 12%. If these observing time losses are converted into VLBI data yield losses,\nthen 2003 had about 28% VLBI data loss and previous years about 24%. Whether these results\nreflect a significant decline in performauce is not clear. There were several significant problems\nthat contributed large data losses to 2003\'s results. Typically these were receivers that either failed\nor had their cryogenics fail or antenna failures. Without more information about the long term\nperformance of the network, these problems might be considered anomalous.\nIn previous years an assessment of each station\'s performance was given in this report. That\npractice has been discontinued. Although many caveats were provided to discourage people from\nassigning too much significance to the results, there was feedback that suggested that the results\nwere being over-interpreted. Some stations reported that their funding could be placed in jeopardy\nif their performance appeared bad even if it was for reasons beyond their control. Last and least,\nthere seemed to be some interest in attempting to "game" the system to improve the individual\nresults. Consequently, this year only s u ~ ~ ~results are presented.\na r y\nFor the purposes of this report, the stations were divided into two categories: (A) those that\nwere included in 14 or more network sessions, and (B) those in nine or fewer. Some of the stations\nin the former category had been included in as many as 100 sessions. The distinction between\nthese two groups was made on the assumption that the results would be more meaningful for the\nstations participating in more sessions.\nThere are 15 stations in the 14 or more session category. Of these 10 successfully collected\ndata for approximately 90% of their expected observing time. Four more stations collected 70%\nor more. One station in this group collected about 60%. The vast majority of the commonly used\nstations are in the 90% or more category.\nThere are 22 stations in the nine or fewer session category. This category included several\nstations that had previously not been included IVS sessions, including several domestic Japanese\nstations. The range of successful observing time for stations in this category was 35\'?46-100%. The\nmedian success rate was 87%. Overall the stations in this category observed successfully about\n78% of the time.\nAlthough the results are not being reported for individual stations, a few stations deserve\nspecial recognition for how much their data collection improved from the previous year. Four\nstations improved the percentage of data they collected by more than 5%- These stations are\nFortaleza, HartRAO, Ny-Alesund, and Onsala. Given the high level of reliability of these stations\nit will be impossible for most of them to improve by this much again this year.\nThe losses were also analyzed by sub-system for each station. Individual stations can contact\nthe network coordinator (weh@ivscc.gsfc.nasa.gov) for the break-down for their individual station.\nA summary of the losses for the entire network is presented in Table 1.\nThe categories in Table 1 are rather broad and require some explanation. The "Receiver"\ncategory includes all problems related to the receiver including out-right failure, loss of sensitivity\nbecause the cryogenics failed, and design problems that impact the sensitivity. The "Antenna"\ncategory includes all antenna problems including mis-pointing, antenna control computer failures,\nand mechanical break-downs of the antenna. The "Unknown" category is a special category for\n\nIVS 2003 Annual Report\n\n1\n9\n\nNetwork Coordinator\n\nNVI, Inc./GSFC\n\nTable 1.

The \xe2\x80\x9cRecorder\xe2\x80\x9d\ncategory includes all electrical and mechanical problems related to the recorder system (tape or\ndisk). This includes passes that are unrecoverable because of overwriting. The \xe2\x80\x9cRFI\xe2\x80\x9d category\nincludes all losses directly attributable to interference. The \xe2\x80\x9cShipping\xe2\x80\x9d category includes data\nthat could not be correlated because the media was either lost in shipping or held up in customs\nlong enough that it could not be correlated with the rest of the session data. The \xe2\x80\x9cMiscellaneous\xe2\x80\x9d\ncategory includes several small problems that do not fit into other categories, including errors in\nthe observing schedule provided by the Operation Centers. However, by far the largest contributor\nto this category is power failures. In retrospect power failures should have had their own category.\nThe \xe2\x80\x9cRack\xe2\x80\x9d category includes all failures that could be attributed to the rack (DAS) including the\nformatter and BBCs. The \xe2\x80\x9cOperations\xe2\x80\x9d category includes all operation errors, such as DRUDG-ing\nthe wrong schedule, starting late because of shift problems, problems changing tapes and others.\nThe \xe2\x80\x9cClock\xe2\x80\x9d category includes situations where correlation was impossible because either the clock\noffset was not provided or was wrong leading to no fringes. It is difficult to be sure in some of\nthese cases that the clock offset was the culprit, but in some it was clear. The \xe2\x80\x9cSoftware\xe2\x80\x9d category\nincludes all instances of software problems causing data to be lost. This includes crashes of the\nField System, crashes of the local station software, and operating system problems. This category\ncould also include errors in files generated by the DRUDG program, but none of these were noted\nfor 2003.\nFrom the results it can be seen that receiver, antenna, and recorder account for more than 50%\nof the losses. In fact for 2003 there were several unusual receiver and antenna problems. If these\nare not repeated in 2004, the data yield should be better. Additionally, the data losses associated\nwith the recorder should go down significantly as more stations switch to using disk drives for\nmedia. The disk systems are much more reliable than tape recorders.\n\n20\n\nIVS 2003 Annual Report\n\nNVI, Inc./GSFC\n\nNetwork Coordinator\n\n2.

Kokee UTC Correlator Adjustment\n\nAs noted in the previous year\xe2\x80\x99s report, it is important to develop consistent procedures for\nhandling the clock offsets during the correlation process. Stations measure the offset between their\nformatter and the UTC time provided by GPS. The correlators typically apply a small, a few\npeconds or less, adjustment to the measured offsets in order to align the data to get fringes. If\nthe adjustments are not applied in a consistent fashion by all correlators a corresponding error will\nbe made in the UT1-UTC parameter adjustments. This will af\xe2\x82\xacect the quality of IVS products at\nthe level of the inconsistency in the adjustments applied for correlation. This could be corrected\nduring the data analysis, but currently no analysis packages do this. It would require a significant\namount of bookkeeping to add this feature now.\nLast year\xe2\x80\x99s report recommended that the correlators develop a consistent table of adjustments\nto correct the local measurements of the formatter relative to GPS. This would remove a source of\ncorrelator-to-correlator and session-to-sessionvariability in the UT1-UTC results. It was suggested\nthat in developing this table the applied correction for Kokee should be artificially set to zero.\nIVS 2003 Annual Report\n\n21\n\nNetwork Coordinator\n\nNVI, Inc./GSFC\n\nAlthough not strictly correct, it is a simple approach and will maintain a level of consistency with\nold data, much of which was processed by WACO with an offset of zero for Kokee. However, the\n\xe2\x80\x9ctrue\xe2\x80\x9d adjustment will have to be compensated for when an effort is made to align the ICRF and\nITRF at this level. It was also recommended in last year\xe2\x80\x99s report that a reference for the clock\nrate should be established at the same time. Although this is not as critical as the offset, it can\neasily be handled at the same time. Of course a good candidate station for the clock rate reference\nhas to be found. As of last year\xe2\x80\x99s report, it seemed that Kokee\xe2\x80\x99s small rate relative to GPS, le-14\nor better, would make it a good candidate. This would be a convenient choice for consistency\xe2\x80\x99s\nsake since again WACO has assumed that Kokee had a zero rate for much of the old data. This\ndiscussion is carried on in more detail in last year\xe2\x80\x99s report.\nAt the IVS Directing Board meeting in September 2004, the Correlator Representative to\nthe Directing Board had offered to develop a consistent set of adjustments for the correlators\nto use. Currently this set of adjustments is under development [K. Kingham, USNO, private\ncommunication]. Consequently it would be premature to expect the offsets to be consistent for\n2003. As a sample of the situation in 2003, the adjustments for Kokee are shown by correlator\nin Figure 1. In this figure it can be seen that the UTC adjustment applied by WACO is zero.\nBoth Bonn and Haystack variable but small non-zero adjustments. The results for UT1-UTC will\nbe affected at the level that the adjustments vary, less than 0.5 psecond. However the offsets\napplied by Penticton have considerably more variation. Since there were no sessions involving\nKokee processed by the GSI correlator, we have no information about the adjustments for this\nstation and correlator combination.\nIt is not only important that the UTC adjustments applied by the correlators are all consistent,\nbut also the final clock value must be applied in the generation of the time-tags for the observations.\nIt is known that this is done at the three Haystack Observatory developed correlators: Bonn,\nHaystack, and WACO. However it is not known what the Penticton and GSI correlators do in this\nregard. Requests have been made to B. Petrachenko and K. Takashima, respectively, to find out\nmore about how these correlators handle the offsets. (We also have no information about clock\noffsets are handled by the Miytaka correlator. However, the IVS geodetic sessions that Miytaka\nprocesses are not primarily intended to measure UT1-UTC.) If the final clock value is not applied\nin the generation of the time tags, the session-tesession variation in the locally measured formatter\nto GPS will be included in the UT1-UTC parameter estimates.\nAnother area of concern is that different recording systems may require different adjustments.\nA particular example is that the CRF22 session was correlated at WACO using data from two\ndifferent systems: K3 formatter recorded to tape and a K5 recorder using disks. WACO found a\n3.3 psecond clock offset between the two systems. This difference corresponds to almost a kilometer\nof cable difference. This does not seem realistic. If no cause for this is found, and probably even\nif it is, it will be necessary to calibrate the differences between different systems. This might be\nundertaken by recording the same data with two or more systems and then comparing the final\nclock offsets that are needed to correlate them.\n\n~\n\n22\n\n~\n\nIVS 2003 Annual Report\n\n'
