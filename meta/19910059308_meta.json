Failure tolerance may be called upon to improve system reliability, maintainability, and survivability, and the issues attached to achieving these goals are examined. Robustness, which is required in some degree by all failure-tolerant systems, is discussed. The use of parallel redundancy is examined. Analytical redundancy, the principal functions of which are failure detection, failure identification, and control-system reconfiguration, is also considered. The use of expert systems and neural networks is discussed.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "publications": [{"volume": "11", "submissionId": 19910059308, "issn": "0272-1708", "id": "64b25497a50147698cd78c06fb372b9c", "publicationName": "IEEE Control Systems Magazine", "publicationDate": "1991-06-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
