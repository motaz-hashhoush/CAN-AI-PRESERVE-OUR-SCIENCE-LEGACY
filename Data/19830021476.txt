Also, with the evolution of the new global habitability programs,\nparticularly the land-related sciences efforts, we have found that many of our\nexisting programs fit well into this new proposed thrust area of NASA. In addition, preliminary analysis of thematic mapper data shows that it will open broad\nnew horizons in providing informational content that could not before be\nobtained from available remotely sensed data.\nBecause of the diversity of the Center\'s activities and the wide number of\nparticipating scientists, our research and technology transfer efforts involve a\nnumber of subject matter areas. As renewable resources become increasingly\nimportant, the need for identifying forest types becomes extremely important.\nThe study by Carl Ramm and Denny Hudson examined this area with the use of\nLandsat data.\t\n\nTheir overall accuracy for forest cover type identification was\n\n855. Thus, these and future techniques will be extremely useful to many industries.\t\n\nFurther research efforts will study forest vegetation identification as\n\nit relates to biomass, deforestation and NCO\n\nflux studies.\n\nEnergy balance and hydrologic cycles require knowledge of synoptic temperature patterns.\t\n\nExtensive analysis showed that HCMM data can provide this type\n\nof information and it appears that GOES data would also provide valuable information on a diurnal basis. Preliminary indications are that this information\nwill help with the understanding of man\'s impact on the surface conditions of\nthis planet and the data can be used in models to aid in determining energy balance and hydrologic studies.\nAs man\'s activities (with increasing population demands throughout the\nworld) are impacting land cover and land use, it is increasingly important that\n1\n\n2\n\n9\n\nwe can develop techniques for detecting change and updating inventories of surface conditions. The project entitled Land Surface Change Detection outlines\nsignificant progress in this general and important area. This analysis has\nalready shown classification accuracies for the urban and forestry test sites\napproaching the 75% accuracy standard used in the preliminary study. A much\nbetter understanding is evolving relative to the relationship with the diversity\nand spatial complexity of the test sites being classified. The preliminary\nthematic mapper data available shows that significant increases in accuracy will\nbe possible with this information.\nSoil mapping is one of the major undertakings in inventorying our key\nresources worldwide. The study on "Determination of Soil Map Unit Composition\nby Electronic Scanning Densitometry" examined new methods for aiding in soil map\nunit composition determinations and outlines the accuracy that can be expected.\nThe research dealing with virus infection of vineyards and blueberry fields\nis an important basic study. Plant diseases have a major impact on crop productivity and fundamental studies are required, such as this one, to better delineate the value of remote sensing, its limitations and research directions for\nimproving sensor capabilities.\nSeveral contractual activities were done under the broad responsibilities\nof the Center for Remote Sensing. Tbese included an Important Farmlands Inventory for several Michigan counties which identified areas of prime and unique\nfarmlands. Another project studied changes in the aquatic vegetation in Saginaw\nBay and showed how remote sensing could be a key tool in delineating over time\nthe extreme variations that occurred in aquatic vegetation areas. The study\nused historic aerial photography and the capabilities of a geographic informstion system to analyze a 28-year time sequence of changes in the amount and distribution of aquatic vegetation. The analysis showed clearly that dramatic\n\n3\n\n10\n\nshifts do occur and it provided aerial atatistias and documented some of the\ncyclic patterns involved. A special study was undertaken using aerial photography in hybrid poplar research. The hybrid poplar research program is particularly significant as we look to the future when bioenergy plantations will\nbecome increasingly important. These effort:, are helping to develop techniques\nfor inventorying the bio-resources available through hybrid poplar plantations.\nClose ties have evolved with an international project in the Department of\nResuorce Development at MSU which is titled Comprehensive Resource Inventory and\nEvaluation System (CRIES). Major resource inventory projects are on-going in\nJamaica, Honduras, Dominican Republic and Kenya. This project provides support\nto the Center for certain CRIES-related activities, which have many implications\nfor the global habitability program from an international standpoint. Through\nthe CRIES project new detailed data bases have been developed for several countries and cross-checked with ground truth information. Our past international\nwork could provide key sites for many studies on changes in cropping practices,\ndeforestation, and in the broad areas of biological productivity vad impacts on\nthe hydrological cycle.\n\n-rte\t\n\n_.^z ..\n\nC\nPARTICIPATING FACULTY AND STAFF OF\nTHE CENTER FOR REMOTE SENSING\n\nFaculty\nJon F.

Ramm\nDepartment of Forestry\nWilliam D. Hudson\nCenter for Remote Sensing\nDepartment of Forestry\nThis study evaluated the use of Landsat computer enhanced imagery for mapping coniferous forest types in Michigan\'s northern Lower Peninsula. Visual\ninterpretation procedures were developed and tested over two sites to determine\nthe feasibility of identifying coniferous species. The accuracy achieved by two\ninterpreters was compared and summarized in contingency tables. Overall classification accuracies were 85 and 73 percent whereas individual species\ninterpretability accuracies ranged from a low of 32 percent for mixed pine\nstands :o 95 percent for Jack pine plantations. Most of the errors in mapping\nthe pines were accounted for by confusion between the individual pine species.\nThe swamp conifer type had consistently low interpretation accuracies at both\ntest sites. Other factors affecting interpretation accuracies were also identified and are reported.\nThe objective of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of mapping coniferous forest types in the northern Lower Peninsula of Michigan through visual\ninterpretation of computer-enhanced Landsat imagery.\n\t\n\nThe climate, physiography and soils of the northern Lower Peninsula combine\n\ni\n\nto create a unique habitat region, as compared to the southern Lower Peninsula\ny.\n\nor the Upper Peninsula. One of the most distinctive landscapes are high outwash\nplains near the center part of the region, which are dominated by stands of\nPines and oaks. These extensive, flat, sandy plains, which formerly supported\n\t\nR\n\nthe large white pine forests of Michigan, support much of the nearly seven mil5\n\n6\nlion acres of forest found in this unit.\nHardwood forests are more extensive than the softwoods with aspen-birch, a\nsub-climax type, the most common throughout the region. The northern hardwood\ntype is most prevalent in the northwestern counties, while lowland hardwoods are\nprimarily restricted to riparian sites. The softwoods, or coniferous forest\ntypes, occupy approximately 22 percent of the region. Three-fifths of these\nconifers are pines; hack pine, the most Important pine sub-type, accounts for\nmore than half the acreage. Jack pine occurs as a relatively pure type in a\nbroad belt from the central northeastern area, south and west to the southwest\ncentral area. Significant areas are also found in the east and westeentral\ncounties. The swamp conifer types, consisting predominately of cedar with\nlesser areas of black spruce, balsam fir-white spruce and tamarack, comprise\nunder 9 percent of the forest land. These swamp conifers occur most frequently\nas small patches of a few acres on wet lands. The exceptions are in the\nnortheastern counties where these Species are more frequent and exist as larger\nstands.\nTwo test sites were chosen in the northern Lower Peninsula to be representative of areas now supporting large acreages of conifers. The first test site\nwas located in west central Wexford County (T. 22 and 23 N., R. 12 W.) and is\nunderlain primarily by stratified sand and gravel outwash deposits confined to a\nbroad valley (i.e., a valley train). Most of the area was cleared for agriculture at one time, but later was abandoned as unsuitable for sustained crop production. The present forest covers over 40 percent of the area and is predominately pine plantations. Red pine accounts for 60 percent of the plantations,\nJack pine is predominate in 29 percent of the plantations and 11 percent are\nmixtures of red and hack pine. Ten percent of the forest land is composed of\nthe swamp conifer type. These stands, composed of scattered northern white-\n\n7\n\nC\ncedar intermixed with lowland hardwoods, are concentrated along several creeks\ntraversing the region. The second test site was located in northeastern Crewford County and Southeastern Otsego County (T. 28 and 29 N., R. 1 W.). This\narea is part of an extensive outwash plain and is typical of the "Jack pine\nflats" of the northern Lower Peninsula of Michigan. No evidence of land clearing for agriculture is present and the forest is entirely natural (e.g. there\nare no plantations). The area is nearly entirely forested, with conifers domanent on 72 percent of the area, the remainder being predominately hardwoods,\ngrass or brush. Pines are located throughout the site except for two large\nswamps which support lowland conifer species. Jack pine is by far the predominant species throughout the site and represents over 70 percent of the softwood\nacreage.\nSince the study dealt only with coniferous vegetation, a "leaf-off" scene\nwas chosen because of its sharp tonal (color) contrasts of several coniferous\nforest types. Based upon an initial analysis of this scene and the oharacteristics of the coniferous forest distribution in the northern Lower Peninsula, a\nClassification scheme was developed.\nBecause of their large aggregate acreage and wide distribution, stands of\nJack pine, red pine and mixed stands were delineated but white pine, which\nrepresents less than 1 percent of the forest land, was not separated out. Lowland conifers, because of their small total acreage and tendency to form highly\nmixed stands, were grouped into a single category.\nTo facilitate interpretation and mapping functions, a pin-registered overlay system was utilized. For each test site a base map was constructed from\nU.S. Geological Survey topographic maps. These maps, at a scale of approximately one inch to the mile, were registered, via punched holes aligned by a\nmetal pin bar, with the "ground truth" maps and the Londsat interpretation maps.\n\n8\n\nThis system permitted precise overlaying and comparison of two or more of the\nseparate maps.\nPrior to actual photo-interpretation, the two interpreters were given preliminary training, including the development of photo-interpretation training\naids. Photo keys were prepared to illustrate the appearance of the different\nconiferous forest types on Landsat false-color composites. Additional training\nconsisted of the systematic comparison of several examples of each forest type\non high-altitude color infrared photography and on the Landsat color composite,\ncoupled with specifically gathered forest stand inventory measurements.\nThe interpretation entailed the enlargement of the Landsat color composite\non a precision rear projector. Magnification was controlled by matching the\nenlarged Landsat scene to the previously-prepared base map, and than replacing\nthe base map with a blank sheet of polyester film. Utilizing the previous photo\ncomparisons and photo keys, the interpreters identified and delineated the boundaries of all coniferous forest stands. Tone, and, in some cases, texture, were\nthe main interpretation criteria for the pine classes. Proximity to stream\ncourses and water bodies were an additional aid in distinguishing between upland\npine types and lowland swamp conifers.\nTo evaluate the accuracy of the visual interpretation procedure, the\nLandsat interpretations were compared with previously compiled cover type maps.\nThese maps, which were prepared specifically for this project, were constructed\nfrom photo-interpretation of medium-scale (1:24,000) color infrared photography.\nAdditionally, both U.S.D.A. Forest Service and Michigan Department of Natural\nResources forest cover type maps were consulted in conjunction with ground\nverification by field crews.\t\n4\n\nAll errors in each Landsat interpretation map were identified by superimposing these maps on the cover type maps using the pin-registration system. The\n\n1\t\n\n1\n\n9\n\n9\n\nG\n\nstres of each stand was measured using a 160 dot/inch` grid and the results summarised in contingency tables (Tables 1 and 2).\n\nTable 1.

Mixed plantations, where neither species represents more than\n\n75 percent\n\nIJ\n11\n\nor Lne sLOCKing, were consistently miaclassified. Further investigation\nrevealed that two-thirds of these errors were accounted for by commission and\nomission errors to the red pine type. Additional cross checks confirmed that\nthe majority of errors in the pine types were due to misclassifications among\nthe several pine speci\':s.\nAccuracies obtained without considering the within-pine variability, that\nis, utilizing a "pooled" pine category, show that pines were correctly interpreted 93 percent of the time.\nThe swamp conifer type was correctly delineated and classified with approximately 73 percent accuracy. The lower reported accuracy (52 percent) resulted\nfrom a large commission type error. Upon examining the medium-scale photography, the majority of these errors were found to occur over swamp areas dominated\nby lowland brush and/or lowland hardwood species. Further "lumping" of species\nwas attempted and indicated that forest land as a single category was interpreted with 90 percent accuracy.\nTable 2 summarizes the Landsat interpretation accuracies for the Crawford\nCounty test site. The lower accuracies for both red and hack pine may be caused\nby their lower stocking levels, with many stands grading into non-forest \t\n\ni\n\ncategories (i.e., less than 25 percent stocked). The various forest types\nencountered at this site exhibited less contrast than those at the Wexford\nCounty site. Most errors in the pine categories occured among the various pine\ntypes, and in recognizing hardwoods intermixed with low density pines such as\nJack pine.\t\n\nAgain, "pooling" the pine types increased overall interpretation\n\naccuracy to 77 percent for the pine category.\nErrors in swamp conifer type were similar to those found in the Wexford\ni\nCounty site.\t\n\nLowland brush, often with scattered trees, were the most fre-\n\nquently misinterpreted areas, although some confusion between Jack pine and\n\n^r\n\nswamp conifers did occur.

These took a considerable length of time to obtain, however, they\nhave now been examined, screened and are ready for detailed statistical\nanalysis.\nHCMM data has been acquired of approximately 12 scenes over Michigan, one\nscene over Georgia and two scenes over Florida. Preliminary analysis of this\ninformation shows that the data looks good and provides extremely valuable\ninformation on temperature patterns and reflectances as influenced by man\'s\nactivities and alterations of the earth\'s surface.\nUse of this information in more quantitative approaches has resulted in a\npaper (see Appendix). This paper pulls together past unpublished information by\nthe author as well as new analysis that has been made during the last contract\nperiod. The paper summarizes the past information, our new knowledge and the\nimplications and nee\' for further analysis. A part of this activity led to a\nproposal entitled, "Temperature and Reflectance Monitored from Satellites as an\nIndication of Shift and Impact of Vegetation Change." This proposal will be\nfunded out of NASA Goddard.\n\n13\n\nLAND SURFACE CHANGE DETECTION USING\nSATELLITE DATA AND A GEOGRAPHIC DATA BASE\n\nWilliam R. Enalin\nCenter for Remote Sensing\nAnil Jain, Eric Backer and Ardeshir Goshtasby\nDepartment of Computer Science\n. Richard Hill-Rowley\nDepartment of Geography\nMichael Scieszka\nMichigan Department of Natural Resources\nThe basic objective of this research is to develop methods and techniques\nfor the detection, monitoring and modeling of land surface changes from data\nacquired by satellite sensor systems. Data from the Landsat mult13pectral\nscanner (MSS), weather satellites, and the new Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) are\nbeing evaluated to determine the capability to accurately identify land cover\nand land use types and detect land surface changes.\nThe research is being conducted in cooperation with the Michigan Resource\nInventory Program, which is currently implementing a legislated statewide information system. The system includes digitized photo-derived land use information\nwhich will serve as the baseline data set for comparisons with computer-aided\nclassifications of satellite digital images. The aim is to develop and evaluate\ntechniques and methodologies for integrating and processing data obtained from\nsatellite sensors with data layers in the geographic information system of the\nstate. This research will eventually lead to the design of multi-stage change\ndetection research.\nSeveral research areas have been identified which will provide techniques\nneeded as components of an overall system for monitoring land cover/use changes\nand updating regional and statewide geo-referenced data bases. Other areas of\nresearch are being defined related to integrating and analyzing satellite data\n14\n\n15\n\nwith selected earth surface attribute seta of the data base, particularly information on forest stand type, size and density. A summary of the current efforts\nin each research area follows.\n\nIMAGE REGISTRATION\nAccurate image registration is a prerequisite for most change detection and\ninventory update methods. We have, therefore, concentrated our initial work in\nthis area. Techniques to handle three types of image \' registration will be\nrequired for the research, i.e., image to image, image to geographic data base\nand image with ancillary data sets such as digital elevation data.\nSeveral multi-image registration algorithms have been developed and\nevaluated during this reporting period. Emphasis had been placed on automatic\ndigital image registration procedures that handle images with translational,\nrotational and scaling differences. One procedure, which has been reported in a\npaper (see Appendix), involves 1) segmentation of images, 2) isolation of dominant objects,\n\n3)\n\ndetermination of corresponding objects in the two images and\n\n4) estimation of transformation parameters using the center of gravities of\nobjects as control points. This method has been used to register different\nimages of Michigan acquired by the Heat Capacity Mapping Mission (HCMM) satellite. HCMM images have also been registered with images from the Geostationary\nOperational Environmental Satellite (GOES) using invariant moments.\nAttempts were made to register airborne thematic mapper (TM) simulation\ndata with a Landsat MSS scene. Geometric distortions in the aircraft data\nprevented a good fit, however we believe that a recently-acquired Landsat TM\nscene can be properly registered to Landsat MSS scenes.\nWe have also begun to explore computer-based techniques for the determinetion of pixel elevation based upon the registration of stereo images. These\n\t\n\ni\n\ntechniques will be useful in the analysis and classification of data from\nt\n\n16\n\npointable sensors on satellites.\nWork on the registration of digital images to the states geographic information system (GIS) data files has not been started due to problems in reformating the GIS data for tape output. When tape reformating.is accomplished, routines will be written to handle polygon-to-raster conversions and image to data\nbase registration.\nAs an initial check of registration potential, a county area on a Landsat\nTM Band 5 scene was photographically enlarged to a scale of 1:48,000 and overlayed with a clear-acetate copy of a computer-drawn land use map from the Michigan Resource Inventory System. The information content (tonal areas) in the\nLandsat TM scene coincided perfectly with the polygonal areas of the land use\ncategories shown on the map. Based on the goodness of fit of the photographic\nproducts, we believe that the corresponding digital data sets can be easily and\naccurately registered.\nTo date no work has begun on merging ancillary data sets with digital\nimages from satellite sensors. However, digital elevation data for two\n1:250,000 topographic quadrangles has been ordered and received from the\nNational Cartographic Information Center.\n\nIMAGE SEGMENTATION\nChange detection through scene analysis of multiple digital images often\nrequires adequate segmentation of the images. Various techniques for image segmentation will eventually be evaluated including edge operators, thresholding,\nregion growing and multi-image segmentation procedures for determining\ncorresponding regions in two data sets. Resultant binary masks for forest and \t\n\nj\n\nurban features will then be employed to limit image classification and change\nidentification within predefined areas.

I\nThe major research objective of this study was to evaluate the informstional value of Landsat digital data in the context of providing land use data\nto users in Michigan. Information on user needs was developed through an extensive survey focusing primarily on land use planners. Land categories were identified and subsequently modified in order to be compatible with processing of\nLandsat data.\nThree test sites, each characterized by a distinct land use type ( agricultural, urban and forest) were chosen to evaluate Landsat performance. For each\nof these sites Landsat data for August 16, 1979 were classified by means of\nthree commonly available algorithms ( maximum likelihood, minimum distance-tomeans, grouping of cluster classes). Accuracy evaluation of the resulting classifications included examining the effects of generalization for geographic\ninformation system formats.\nConclusions derived from the study can be summarized in three major areas.\nAnalysis of land use categories identified by questionnaire responses, in conjunction with limitations imposed by the characteristics of the Landsat data,\nshow that the minimum land use requirements of the majority of planners surveyed\n\n((\t\n4\t\n\nDigital Landsat Classification\n1 Hill - Rowley, Richard, 1982.

The categories that\nremained, nevertheless, represent the dominant land use classes in each of the\nareas selected. Accurate updating and/or remapping of these categories wound be\nof considerable value.\nClassification accuracies for the urban and forest test sites approached\nthe 75% accuracy standard used in the study. Accuracies for the agricultural\nsite were significantly lower. Variations were present among algorithms, with\nthe unsupervised grouping of cluster classes substantially superior in the agricultural site, maximum likelihood the most accurate in the urban site and\nminimum distance-to-means preferable in the forest site. Despite this distribution, no significant difference existed at the\n\n95x-confidence level between the\n\noverall performance of the algorithms.\nAccuracy analysis of the generalized Landsat classes, when compared with\ngeocoded land use types derived from airphoto interpretation, resulted in a substantially lower accuracy than the some comparison between actual aerial photography and the pixel-based Landsat classification. The extent of this accuracy\nloss seems to have a direct relationship with the diversity and spatial complexity of the test site being classified.\n\nCHANGE DETECTION\n\nNo work on change detection techniques was performed with Landsat digital\ndata this reporting period due to the previously-stated problems with the tape\nroutines of the state\'s CIS system. However, preliminary evaluations are being\nmade of the superimposed Landsat TM/GIS Landuse Map product. The landuse data\nwas obtained from\n\n1978 color infrared aerial photography whereas the TM data was\n\nacquired in October\n\n1982. fie most predominant changes identified through\n\nvisual analysis were forest clear-cut areas and new pads for oil/gas wells. The\noil/gas pads are easily identifiable on TM images because of their regular\'\n\n19\nK\ngeometry and seral dimensions. Work is underway to automatically pin\xe2\x80\x94point the\ngeographic location (latitude and longitude) of oil/gas pads. This will require\nan evaluation of the relative geometric accuracy of the state\'s GIS data files\nand the Centers Landsat geometric correction routines.\n\nc.\nDETERMINATION OF SOIL MAP UNIT COMPOSITION\nBY ELECTRONIC SCANNING DEN31TOMETRY\n\nDelbert L. Mokma\nDepartment of Crop and Soil Sciences\nModern soil survey reports provide information on the soil resources of an\narea to a wide spectrum of public and private users. Natural soil boundaries\nare located by soil scientists in the field and delineated on an aerial photographic base. Some map units are made up of primarily one kind of soil, while\nothers are made up of two or more soil series. Most soil map units include\nsmall areas of other soils because the map scale and nature of the soils in the\narea do not permit the separation of these small areas. In some map units these\nincluded soils have properties that differ substantially form those of the dominant soil or soils and, thus, could significantly affect use and management of\nthe map unit. A soil complex is used to represent areas where two or more soils\nmake up a large portion of the map unit but are so intricately mixed or so small\nin size that they cannot be separated on the soil map.\nThe percent composition of each soil in a soil complex is reported in the\nsoil survey report. These data are obtained from field observations. Statistioal sampling methods and ground enumeration techniques have been developed to\nimprove the accuracy of these map unit composition data. However, most of these\nmethods are labor-intensive and not extensively utilized.\nMany soil complexes in Michigan have a mottled appearance on aerial photography because of differences in soil moisture, organic matter content, surface\ntexture and/or vegetative variation. Imagery of bare or sparsely vegetated\nground collected during spring months generally provides the Most distinctive\npatterns. Soil scientists recognize relationships between some tonal patterns\nand kinds of soil. Thus, photointerpretation is an important part of soil map-\n\n20\n\ni\\\n\n21\n\nG\n\nping. Electronic scanning densitometry can classify the range of density values\nInto range categories and rapidly determine the percentage composition within an\narea.\nfie objective of this study is to evaluate the suitability of electronic\nscanning densitometry to accurately determine soil complex composition in a\ntimely and cost-effective manner.\n\nMETHODOLOGY\n\nThree soil complexes, Tappan-Londo looms, 0 to 2 percent slopes, TappanAvoca complex, 0 to 3 percent slopes and Guelph-Londo looms, 0 to 6 percent\nslopes, were selected for investigation. The classification of the soil series\nare:\nTappan - Typic Haplaquolls, fine-loamy, mixed (calcareous), magic\nLondo - Aerie Glossaqualfs, fine-loamy, mixed, mesio\nAvoca - Entic Haplaquods, sandy over loamy, mixed, mesic\nGuelph - Glossoboric Hapludalfs, fine-loamy, mixed, mesic\nTwo fields of each complex were located in Tuscola County, Michigan where a\nmodern soil survey is in progress. Thus, the findings of this study would benefit the survey party in preparing composition estimates of these soil complexes.\nEach of the fields had no or sparse vegetation at the time the aerial photograph\nwas taken.\nUsing black-and-white panchromatic aerial photo transparencies the six\nfields were digitized using an EYECOM Image Scanner (Spatial Data Systems). The\ncell size used was about 3 m square.\nTo determine the composition of the soil complexes, observations were made\nin a grid pattern at 30 m intervals. Soils were classified to the soil series\nlevel in the field. Surface horizon texture, type of aurfaee horizon, depth to\nfree carbonates, and thickness of sand, where present, were recorded for each\n\nThe soils data will be overlaid on the digitized density maps to determine\nthe range of density values for each soil in the complex. Then the composition\nof the complexes will be determined using the digitized data and compared with\nthat determined from field observations.\n\nRESULTS\nAn example of the digitized soil nap for the Tappan-Londo complex is shown\nin Figure 1. The density ranged from 0 (dark) to 255 (light). The range of\ndensity for Tappan was 50 to 100 and for Lando was 100 to 174. For the field in\nFigure 1 the composition is 52 percent Tappan and 48 percent Lando.\nThe composition of the three soil complexes based on field observation is\ngiven in Table 1. The Tappan-Londo complex is composed of about 50 percent Tappan and 40 percent Lando with 5 percent Parkhill and 4 percent other soils.\nParkhill had properties similar to Tappan while the other soils were more similar to Londo. Combining these soils the composition of soils with reflectance\nproperties similar to Tappan is 55 percent and those similar to Londo is 44 percent. These values are not significantly different from those estimated fer the\nfield in Figure 1 using electronic scanning densitometry. This indicates the\npotential for the use of this technique to determine composition of soil eom.\nplexes.\n\nFUTURE WORK\nThe comparison of the soils data with the density maps of the remaining\nfive fields will be completed. This will give a more accurate evaluation of the\nuse of electronic scanning densitometry to determine composition of soil oom1 -\t\n\nplexes.\n\nORIGINAL PAGE 18\n\n23\t\n\nOF POOR QUALITY\n\n., h .,P O- M N N ,&& , NfrMG\nP\nin\n.^ h 00 ^a OHO \t\ne O\xe2\x96\xba\n.4 ., ...,\n-" _\t\n.,\t\nN M rv f\nh.oZN 1\n\n4\n\n.-\t\n\n.4 .. .-\t\n\nP MNN 0%.40%h\t\n.4 ap\n\n.-4\t\n\nO\'\t r-\'\n\n..o\t\n\nf\n\n(i\n\n.\n\no^.4C ^weCx. c\n\t\n.q P" ..\n\n..\n\na\n\nNNMNN MOIL\n\n60\t\n\nh O^ O^ O^ a0\n\nN\n\n\t\n\n^..N .- ,O ^\t ao hC 40 \t\n\neoac\n\nr\n\nO^ 04 0- aD 0 f"\n\n.4\t\n\nr\ncc\t\n\n^p\n\nOa0 \xe2\x96\xba M\na00\n\n^^^a 0^0a0^\xe2\x96\xba a^iD^^^\n.-i\n\n>.\n\nCO\t ^^pp\nO^^ 00000.4 . -1.-1NNO^. 40 ^OaD\nM N\nM\n\nC\n\n~\na0\n\nN\n\n0\n\n.4\npp\t\n\n^^pp\n\nA\nc\n\' \xe2\x80\xa2 -f 0\t\nrl.4.4\n-^\xe2\x80\xa2N-1.M-f.4Oo a a a p a\n\xe2\x80\xa2M h .\n3a\n.4 .-E .-f .4 04 04 .4 0-4 .y .y .4 0-4 .ti\n\nit\n\n7\n\nOMhO \xe2\x96\xba O+\t\nV%\t %D \t V%\t\n., ., .4 .4 .4\n\nM\n601\n\nAD t\n\n\t F..\n\no\t\n\nM..^nOM o M\n%D^D0a0a\t\naO\n\n..., .4 .r .4 .r .^ .4 .4\n\nQ^1^f^iO. -IrM.0k?

Ramsdell\nDepartment of Botany and Plant Pathology\nAdele M. Childress-Roberta\nDepartment of Botany and Plant Pathology\nMichigan blueberry growers have experienced considerable economic loss\nthe infection and spread of two serious virus diseases, blueberry shoes\nvirus (BBSSV) and blueberry leaf mottle virus (BBLMV). Approximately 56% o\ncommercial plantings are of the cultivar Jersey; one of the most suscep\nvarieties to both diseases.\nAnother virus disease on grape, peach rosette mosaic virus (PRMV), has cost\ngrowers millions of dollars. More than 50 vineyards in the southwest section of\nthe state experience crop loss due to this disease. All three diseases are\ntransmitted readily by insect or nematode vectors.\nAn increase in the number of fields becoming infected and resultant\neconomic implications, makes early detection important. Control strategies for\nthese diseases include rouging and replacement of bushes and vines exhibiting\nvisual symptoms. However, a four year latent period is necessary before symptoms are expressed, while infected plants serve as inoculum reservoirs. The\nELISA (Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay) technique while providing an accurate\nprocedure for detecting individual bushes, is costly and impractical on a commercial basis. Therefore, the need exists for the development of a costeffective, accurate and rapid method to discriminate between diseased and\nhealthy plants. One approach is the use of remote sensing to observe spectral\nand geometric changes in plant canopies, using photography and field spectrophoM,`\t\n\ntometric readings at various phonological stages. If practical, these methods\nwould enable growers to rapidly assess the extent of infection before control\n25\n\nz 7\xe2\x80\xa2.\n\n26\n\nmeasures are initiated.\n\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nGround Truth\nTo correlate changes observed on photographic imagery or spectrophotometric\nreadings, areas within infected blueberry fields and vineyards were selected\nbased on a visual assessment of diseased and healthy conditions. Maps (Fig. 1)\nof these areas were constructed and the verification of infected plants was made\nusing ELISA results.\n\nAerial Photography\nAerial photographs were taken of the previously mapped areas in southwest\nand western Michigan at various phenological stages during the 1981 and 1982\ngrowing season. Color, black/white IR and color infrared (CIR) transparencies\n(Kodak Aerochrome Infrared Film 2424 and 2443) were obtained using two ELM/500\nHasselblad camera systems fastened to a belly-mount of a Cessna Skyhawk.\nImagery was acquired at approximately 305 m (AGL) using a 70 nun format with 80\nmm lenses and Wratten 12 and 25 filters.\n\nLow Level Imagery\n\nTower Photography\nTo assess whether infected plants could be detected at lower altitudes, a\n35 mm camera was mounted from a 15 ft. hydraulic tower. Color-, CIR and mult13pectral (70mm) film was taken of adjacent known diseases and healthy plants\nin the field.\t\n\nVertical and angled photographs were taken at various exposure\n\nsettings during full bloom, petal fall, fruit set and during senescence in 1981.\nColor and CIR negatives were analyzed with a color den31tometer to detect dencity differences between plants at various wavelengths.\n\n2\'\n\nSpectral Signature\nChanges in the mesophyll layer of the leaf, the primary site of infrared\nreflectance, may alter the spectral signature of an infected plant. To detect\nsmall reflective differences between healthy and diseased plants, radiometric\nmeasurements were obtained during the\nspectroradiometer. The Spectron SE\n\n1982 growing season using a field-portable\n\n590 (Spectron Engineering Co., Denver, CO)\n\nmeasures reflectance simultaneously at\n\n256 wavelengths (400-1100nm), storing it\n\non digital tape. Readings were recorded from\n\n2.5 m above the plant canopy,\n\nusing a 10 degree field of view. Black/White IR photographs\n\n(35 mm, Wratten 12\n\nfilter) were taken either before or after the spectral scan. Spectral reflectance ratios were obtained by normalizing readings to a BaSO 4 standard reflectance panel.\n\nRESULTS AND DISMISSION\nAerial photographs obtained during the 1981 growing season exhibited subtle\nchanges in reflectivities from bush to bush. Although these changes were\napparent throughout the growing season, they may represent differences in growth\nstages within and among bushes. Color differences were more obvious on color\nfilm than CIR.

The mapping involves the delineation of prime soil areas from\nsoil survey information and the identification of unique farmland, water and\nurban built-up areas form aerial photography (U.S. Department of Agriculture,\nSecretary\'s memorandum number\n\n1827, revised,\n\nOctober\n\n30, 1978).\n\nUnique farm-\n\nlands are lands other than those designated prime that are used for the production of specific high-value food and fiber crops (e.g., tree and bush fruits,\nvineyards and vegetables).\nThe information is compiled onto a 1:50,000 base map of each county and\narea statistics per category are determined. The Important Farmland maps are\nbeing produced under the Land Inventory and Monitoring (LIM) program of the U.S.\nDepartment of Agriculture. Contracts for the preparation of Important Farmland\nmaps of 11 additional counties were undertaken this reporting period, which\nbrings the total under contract to 36 counties.\n\nChanges in Aquatic Vegetation in Saginaw Bay\n\nDuring the past decade, concern had been raised over the loss of wetland\nhabitats along the shores of the Great Lakes, especially the cattail marshes\nwhich provide food and a cover habitat for waterfowl. Because coastal marshes\nare dynamic environments, changes in the amount and composition of aquatic vegetation may occur frequently in response to changes in water level, site moisture\nconditions, wave action from atoms, water chemistry, sedimentation, human\nactivities, and other processes. Fluctuations in the water level of the Great\n\n34\n\n35\n\nLakes are a mayor factor influencing marsh conditions, particularly vegetation\ngrowth and less.\nCenter for Remote Sensing investigators studied coastal watland changes and\ndocumented over time the types, distributions, and amounts of aquatic vegetation\nexisting within three sites along the shoreline of Saginaw Bay in Lake Huron.\nThis work was performed for the East Central Michigan Planning and Development\nRegion.\nThe project mapped aquatic vegetation within three areas for selected years\nthrough interpretation of historical serial photography. Vegetative area by\ncategory was determined per year and its change in subsequent years. The areas\nwere chosen based on the availability of serial photographic coverage, wetland\nlocation within Saginaw Bay, composition of aquatic vegetation, and other physical factors related to the nature of the marsh. The three areas selected are\nstate wildlife areas of Quanicessee, Noyanquing Point and Wildfowl Bay.\nAquatic vegetation maps were prepared for Quanicessee and Nayanquing Point\nfrom aerial photography taken in\nBay from\n\n1950, 1969, 1975, and 1978; and for Wildfowl\n\n1949, 1975, and 1978 photos. The selected years of photo coverage pro-\n\nvide a record of marsh conditions during periods of medium to high lake levels.\nA vegetation classification system and interpretation criteria were established. Through initial photo analysis, it was determined that four categories\nof aquatic vegetation could be identified on the aerial photographs: Submergents, cattails, mixed emergents, and sedges and grasses. Cattail areas were\nfurther classified into three stand density or cover classes\n\n(25%, 25-75%, and\n\n75%), since cover is an important factor in the use of wetland habitats by\nwildlife.\nEleven aquatic vegetation maps were prepared and then digitized using an\nelectronic digitizer. The resulting polygon files were converted to raster\t\n\ns\nj\n\n36\n\nC\n\n(i.e.,\n\ngrid cell) arrays with a 0.1 &ore cell size. These files were displayed\n\non a color monitor for visual analysis and area statistics were calculated for\neach map category and listed on a printer.\nThe findings of the study indicated that between 1949 and 1978, Wildfowl\nBay lost about 40% of its aquatic vegetation (2364 acres), about twice as much\nas either Quenicessee (21%) or Noyanquing Point (179) lost. More importantly,\nWildfowl Bay lost a greater percentage of its high/madium\xe2\x80\x94density cattail stands\n(35%) compared to Quanicessee (31x) or Nsyanquing Point (20%).\nThese greater losses may have been due in part to differences in wave\xe2\x80\x94\naction protection, since both Quanicessee and Noyanquing Point are less exposed\nthan Wildfowl Bay. The location of Wildfowl Bay on the eastern side of Saginaw\nBay subjects it to enhanced wave\xe2\x80\x94action and on\xe2\x80\x94short lake ice movement under the\ninfluence of the prevailing westerly winds. Other factors such as sedimentation\nor water quality differences may-also have been involved.\nA report entitled, "Changes in Aquatic Vegetation in Quanieasaee, Nayanquing Point, and Wildfowl Bay," was prepared by Bill Enslin and Dwayne McIntosh\nfor the East Central Michigan Planning and Development Region.\n\nDigitized Soil Association Map of Michigan\n\nA soils database for the entire state of Michigan was eomplested this\nreporting period. The database was prepared for Dr. Maurice L. Vitosh of the\nDepartment of Crop and Soil Science, Michigan State University. The base map\nused was the Soil Association Map of Michigan, which was compiled by the\nCooperative Extension Service and the Agricultural Experiment Station of Michigan State University and the Soil Conservation Service, United States Department\n\t\ni\n\nof Agriculture. The map base was approximately at a 1 to 1,004,000 scale and\ncontained 78 different soil associations. The database resulting from this map\n\n\t\n\n37\n\ncontains 633 columns by 733 rows of grid cells. The size of one grid cell is\none kilometer. A second variable, county boundaries, was also digitized in\naddition to the soil variable.\nThis database was than used by Dr. Vitosh and the Center to evaluate the\n\n\t\n\n\\\n\nspatial distribution of the effectiveness of soil nitrification inhibitors. The\nfirst step was to group the soil types into five suitability ratings with 1\nbeing a poor response and 5 being a good response to nitrification inhibitors.\nThis was done for the following time periods: early fall, late fall, early\nspring, late sprint and siddress. Area totals and percentages were then generated for these groupings, both on a county ant state level basis. Areas of\nhigh potential were than windowed out of the statewide file and photographed\nfrom the color monitor. The resulting color enlargements gave good visual documentation to supplement the generated statistics. The area totals and color\nenlargements were than used by a local chemical company to evaluate the effectiveness and market potential of a nitrification inhibitor they ware in the process of developing and marks*!ng.\n\nAerial Photography Support for Hybrid-Poplar Research\n\nThe Center for Remote Sensing acquired aerial photography of hybrid-poplar\nresearch stands for Packaging Corporation of America, Manistee, Michigan. The\nphotographs were evaluated :o part of a larger research effort of the company to\naccess woody biomass production on a commercial scale. fie objectives of this\nresearch are to identify short-rotation intensive hardwood silviculture productivity rates from already established large-scale hybrid poplar plantings= identify mayor plantation pests, diseases and their impacts and control measures \t\nneeded to insure high biomass productivity in a large-scale operation; evaluate \t\nthe need for weed control in the second growing season; determine the effect of\n\ni\nj\n\n38\n^=\nseveral herbicides used for post-planting weed control and their effect on tree\ngrowth in the field; test planting stock and site modification techniques which\nmight increase initial establishment success leading to increased growth and\nsurvival and present a consolidated economic evaluation of large-scale biomass\nplantations. Light aircraft, 70mm aerial photographs (both color and colorinfrared) were acquired at four time intervals during the summer of 1982. These\nphotographs were provided to the various investigators (from Packaging Corporation of America, Michigan State University, U.S. Forest Service, Iowa State\nUniversity and Michigan Technological University) for use and evaluation in\ntheir respective research endeavors. Additionally, Center staff have provided\nlimited technical support in the incorporation of the aerial data into the ongoing research efforts.\n\nCRIES Project Assistance\n\nThe Center for Remote Sensing assisted in creating a database of Jamaica.\nThe database was completed last September and was created in conjunction with\nthe Comprehensive Resource Inventory and Evaluation System (CRIES) project,\nDepartment of Resource Development, Michigan State University. The database\ncontained three variables: 13 political divisions (parishes), 23 land use types\nand 240 soil types. The map base was at a 1 to 50,000 scale. The final database resulting from these maps contained 1220 columns by 480 rows of grid cells.\nThe size of one grid cell was 4 hectares (200 x 200 meters). The database was\ninitially created at a much finer resolution (.25 hectares per grid cell) in\norder to capture all of the important information from the base maps. This\nhigher resolution data was then aggregated into the final database resolution of\n4 hectares per grid cell so that a more general analysis could be done. The\nE\t\n\nhigh resolution file was retained for future analysis.\n\n1\n\n39\n\nThis aggregated database was analyzed using various techniques. Overlays\nwere run to find information on coffee and banana production potential. Many\ndifferent types of area totals were also generated. After the analysis had been\ncompleted, the database was transfered from our microcomputer to the\nuniversity\'s mainframe computer. There it was reformated and written out to\ntape in a format compatible with the geographic information system on the mainframe computer resident in Jamaica.\nProjects similar to the Jamaica project are in the process of being completed for the countries of Kenya and Honduras. In addition to the analysis\nmentioned above, a powerful crosstabulation program has been written for CRIES\nby the Center to further analyze the databases of these new projects.\n\nC\n\nEDUCATION AND TRAINING\n\nInterpretation of Color Infrared Airphotos for\nForest Resource Inventories\n\nOctober 28-30, 1980\nJune 16-18, 1981\n\n\t\n\nEscabana, Michigan\n\n\t\n\nSeptember 22-24, 1981\n\nEscabana, Michigan\n\t\n\nSeptember 27-30, 1982\n\n\t\n\nSault Ste.

Study sites were located in\nFlorida and Michigan. Thermal data shoved that day surface temperatures over large areas\ncould be increased by 10-15*C by modifications resulting from agricultural practices.\nChanges in reflected solar radiation as a function of agricultural practices were detectable\nusing NCMM data. 1/\nINTRODUCTION\nThrough clue * man is gradually modifying more of the earth\'s surface to optimise conditions\nfor habitation. The changes are largely for crop production, animal grating and utilisation\nof blame& for cooking and heat. In this process forests are being converted to pastures\nand farmlands, grasslands are being grazed by domestic animals, new species of plants are\nbeing introduced and major portions of the surface are being drained or irrigated.\nThis process has evolved slowly over centuries, but has speeded up dramatically during this\ncentury. Increasing modification of the surface for food production has been an essential\npart of increasing the earth\'s carrying capacity from two billion at the turn of the century\nto over four billion at the present time. Further. these changes will be occurring at an increasingly rapid race as the projected population of the earth doubles by the year 2020 (ll.\nRelatively few studies have assessed the magnitude of these changes or their Impact on surface boundary conditions 12.41. Many characteristics of the surface, including temperature.\nradiation and surface roughness, could be altered significantly. This paper shows that Information available from the National Oceanic uid Atmospheric Administration (NOM) and NASA\'s\nMost Capacity Mapbing Mission (HCMM) satellites and airplane scanner data can help &saes@ the\nImpacts on surface temperature and radiation of man\'s modification of our planet.\nKETNODOLOCY\nSeveral recently launched meteorological satellites have collected valuable data on reflected radiation in the .5 to 1.1 micron range. This band has the information needed for\ngood estimates of solar reflectance from different surfaces (5). Also, data from scanners\nsensing to the 10.5 to 12.5 micron range are available on several satellites which can be\nused to determine surface temperature.

The ehaage is met - only largo In area, but also In Magnitude.\nFrequently 10-12 \' C warmer temperatures were found to agricultural areas when compared to the.\nnatural surface ( rig. 3 asd 4). These modifications could significantly Impact the thermal\nradiation leaving the earth \' s outface and the repartitloning of energy late sensible and\nlatest fluxes.\nFurther. the aircraft thermal data vividly show (rig. 3A and 38) that even within the agricultural areas. as vegetation types are changed or overgrating occurs, there can be further\n\nsignificant changes in the thermal regimes.

INTRODUCTION\n\nn\nGiven two images of the same scene\t\ncoordinate spaces (x,y) and (x\',y\' \xe2\x96\xba , image\nregistration is the determination of\ntransformation functions fl and f2 such\nthat given the coordinates of a point in\none of the images, we can compute the\ncoordinates of the same point in the other\nimage by\nx n fl(x\',y\')\ny \xe2\x80\xa2 f2(x\',y\').\nThe parameters of transformation\nfunctions fl and f2 are estimated using a\nset of corresponding control points from\nthe two images. Selection of control\npoints by hand is often time consuming and\nis susceptible to systematic errors. It is\ndesirable to make the control point\nselection process automatic so that the\nwhole registration process can be carried\nout automatically.\n\nAn aucos.atic technique for selection of\ncontrol 4 pWts in the first image is\navailable This involves selection of\nwindows which 1) contain a large number of\nhigh gradient edges, 2) contain a large\nnumber of connected edges, 3) are unique\nwith respect to neighboring windows, and\n1) are well dispersed in the image. The\nupper left hand corner of the window\nsotiefyinq these pr yparties is taken as a\ncontrol point. In the second image, t\xe2\x80\xa2.\ncontrol points are obtained by carryim ,. \xe2\x80\x9e\na search for the position of besj l,\xe2\x80\xa2 -!, f\n\n.t\n\neach window from the first image\neithe: thq sequential similarity e^ \xc2\xab: .on\nalgorithms or the crossicort::\xe2\x80\xa2tion\ntechnique .\nSelection of control points\nautomatically in this manner has shown to\nbe satisfactory as long as the two images\nhave only translational differences. IPor\nwith\t\nrotational,\t\nim.,ges\t\nand\t\nscaling\ndifferences, the search process becomes\ninaccurate\t\nand\t\nunreliable.\t\nIn\t\nsuch\nsituations,image points which are\nroutinely used as control points include\nintersections of lines (intersections of\nroads in aerial or satellite images) and\npositions where lines join (like positions\nwhere rivers join).\nIn this paper we introduce a technique\nfor automatically finding corresponding\ncontrol points in two images which may have\ntranslational, rotational, and scaling\ndifferences. The technique uses Center Of\ngravities of\n\nobjects\n\nas control\n\npoints.\n\nbecause the coordinates of the center of\ngravity of a shape is the average of the\ncoordinates of the pixels on its boundary,\nif any error has been made in extracting\nthe boundary, that error is averaged over\n\nthe whole boundary and so the effect on the\ncenter of gravity is\t\nsmall.\t\nAnother\nbeneficial\t\nproperty\t\nof Lhe center of\ngravity as control point is that\t\nits\nlocation can be determined upto subpixel\naccuracy while the traditional \t\ncontrol\npoints (like intersection of roads) can\n\nWf2 Moettine Processing d RemOefy Sensed Dote Sympown\n\nA-6\n\n\t\n\nORIGINAL PAGE IS\nOF POOR QUALITY\n\t\n\nA- 7\n\nvalues.\t\ntake\t\nonly\t\ndiscrete\t\nOur\nregistration\t\nalgorithm\t\nconsists\t\nof\nfollowing steps.\t\n1) Segmentation of the\nimages, 2) isolation of dominant objects\n3) determination\t\nfrom the\t\nimages,\t\nof\nccrrespondinq objects in the two images,\nand 4) estimation of transformation\nparameters using the center of gravities of\nobjects as control points.\n\n111. Fmin comsPON01MC mioNs\nOnce the two imagso are segmented, we\nisolate regions with closed boundaries in\neach one of the images. A region which\ntouches the boundary of the imagqe is not\nisolated. Further, very small rtgions are\ndiscarded. The task is now to determine\nthe correspondence between the two sets of\nregions.\n\n11.

A number of\nThere\n\nis\n\nno single image stgmentation\n\nalgorithm which can reliably segment an\narbitrary image.

A\nnumber of techniques have been proposed to\napproptiate\t\nvalue\t\nof the\nobtain\t\na\xe2\x80\x9e\t\nThe threshold value can be\nthreshold.\t\nselected by a xlmizing bht global average\ncontra ta of tNe\t\n\nimage .\t\n\nIn\t\n\nshape matching procedures art avails\n\nSe\n\nie\n\nthe literature. 19urier descriptors , and\ninvariant moments have been extensively\nused for shape matching. The distribution\nof chord lengths joining the center of\ngravities of regions to its boundary points\nhas been proposed as a mtssurt of shape .\nPrice and Reddy 14,15 *xtracted a number\nof features from lath region including\nroundness (perimeter /47r area), length to\nwidth ratio, color, intensity, location,\nrelative position to match the regions is\nthe two images. Their matching ttchnilut\nseems to best fit our problem and we have\nused it with some modifications in the\nexample given in section V.\nIV. TRANSFORMATION FUNCTIONS\n\nanother\n\nmethod the threshold value is determined\nby minimizing the sum of the squares of the\ndifferences of the original image and 6the\nthresholded image pixel by pixel. Katz has\ndetermined the threshold value using the\nedge information present in the image.\t\nWe\nhave chosen the Katz algorithm for the\nsegmentation of HCMM images because of its\nspeed and pertt,rmance on this type et\n\nimage.\t\nthe\nThe algorithm consists or \t\nfollowing four steps.\n1. Compute the gradient of the original\nimage, call it image G.\n2. Find the high\t\ngradient\t\npixels\t\nby\nthresholding image G. Replace all\nvalues above the threshold by 1 and all\nother values by 0. Call the new image\nN.\n7. Multiply H by the original image, call\nthe new image M. Note that M will\ncontain only high gradient pixels of the\noriginal image.\n4. Compute the average gray value of image\nM (nonzero pixels only). This will be\n\nthe required threshold value.\nNote that\t\nthe\t\nalgorithm\t\nrequires\t\nuser-specified parameter in step 2.\n\na\n\nSelection of the right transformation\nfunction is another important factor in the\nregistration of digital images. The best\ntransformation function for registering two\ntranslational\nhave\t\nonly\t\nimages which\t\ndifferences is very simple and has on:y two\na\nApplying\t\nunknown\t\nparameters.\t\ntransformation function with more\nparameters makes the registration process\ncostly and probably less accurate. On the\nother hand, images of the some scene taken\na\nrequire\t\nangles\t\ndifferent\t\nat\t\nunknown\ntransformation function with\nparameters (the projective ;ransformation)\na,A a transformation function with less\nparameters cannot register them accurately.\n\ns\n\nUsually it is known (or assumed) that\n\nthe two im:,goS ba y * only specific\ndifferences and can be registered using an\nappropriate transformation function. There\n0-priori\nwhere\t\nno\t\nare cases though,\t\ninformation is available about the images\nand we have to select the best\ntransformation function to register them.\nUsing the control points, it is possible to\nfind some knowledge about the images and\nthen select the appropriate transformation\nfunction. For example,\n1. Using two pairs of correspond i ng control\nfind two\npoints,\t\nit is possible t\t\ncorresponding line segmentas in the two\nimages.\t\nif the ratio of corresponding\n\nW2 Moehine ProeesseV of Rrvxge)y Sensed Doto Symposium\n\nA-8\nline segments is not e;ual to 1, it\nshows that the two images have scaling\ndifferences.\n2. If the ratio of corresponding line\nsegments are not the same for different\nline pairs. it shows that one of the\nimages is g attrically distorted with\nrespect to the other.\n3. If the angle between corresponding line\npairs in the two images are different,\nit shows that the images have not been\nobtained from the same angle.\nthe\nThe above information helps in\t\nthe right transformation\nof\t\nselection\t\nfunction.\n,o be able to estimtte parameters of a\ntransformation function with n unknowns we\nneed at least n/2 corresponding control\npoints (which are not colinear). Usually\nmore control points are used and parameters\na:e estimated by minimizing the mean.-square\nerror.\nV. AN EXAMPLE\n\nTo show how the propc ,.ed technique\nworks, we have taken a 24Ok240 subimage of\nthe day-visible image obtained by the HCKM\nsatellite on 26 September 1\xc2\xb0 1 9 from an 4rea\nover Michigan(scene id:A-A0518-18110-1).\nThe digital image acquired by the satellite\n(f:gvre 1) was used as the first image.\nThe second image was the digitized image of\nthe ;rint of the same scene provided by the\nNational Space Science Data Center.

Thus average intensity of the 2% of\nthe highest-gradient pixels was used as the\n,!.rtshald value for segmenting the gray\nlevel images. We found that other\nday-visible images of HCMM can be segmented\nsatisfactorily using the same parameter\nFigures 3 and 4 contain the\nvalue 19811.\t\n2,\nsegmented images of figures 1 and \t\nrespectively.\n\nP. CONTROL POINTS\n\nORIGINAL PAGE IS\n\nOF POOR QUALITY\nTen control points were used to register\nthe two images. To obtain the control\npoints, we have used a technique similll to\nthe one proposed by Price and Reddy \t\nto\nfind corresponding .regions in the\t\ntwo\nimages.\nOoject size (p1rimeter) andshape\n(roundness perimeter / 4^tarea) were used to\nfind the two most similar object pairs in\nthe two images. Let\'s call them P and Q.\nNov relative distance (distance of the\ncenter of gravity of an object to the\ncenter of gravity of P/distance between\ncenter of gravities of P and Q), and\nrelative position (angle beteen the line\nconnecting the center of gravity of an\nobject to the center of gravity of P, and\nthe line connecting the center of gravities\nof P and C1 are used to match the rest of\nthe ctie:ts. Since we have two kinds of\nobje=ts (trig!., objects in dark background\nand dark cbjects in bright background) .\nthe matcr is carried out only between\nebjerts c.f the same kind. Once the\ncorrespc^,;:ng objects in the two images are\ndetermined, their boundaries are extracted\n(see fioures 5 and 6), and their center of\nare\t\ng ravities\t\ncomputed which are the\n\ncontrol poir.ts.\n\nTRANSFORMATION FUNCTIONS\nThe two images which we are registering\nhave been derived from a single image by\nartificial);: introducing translational.\nrotationc,l, and scale change. Therefore,\none would suspect that the transformation\nof Carte%ian coordinate systems would be\nable to hrinrj the images into registration.\nUsing the control points, we computed the\nratio of corresponding line segments and\nfound that the ratios change slightly when\nchanging the line pairs. This shows that\none of the images has small geometric\ndistortion with respect to the other. Such\ndistortion might be due to the digitizer\nlens or shrinking of the print\'s paper.\nThe ;rar.sformation function that can\nregister ima g es with geometric distortions\nis the polynomial mapping function. we\nused a second order polynomial mappino\nfunction given by,\nx\'\xe2\x80\xa2 a0\xe2\x80\xa2alx\xe2\x80\xa2a2y\xe2\x80\xa2o3xy\xe2\x80\xa2a4x2\xe2\x80\xa2a5y2\ny\' n b0\xe2\x80\xa2c,lx\xe2\x80\xa2b2y\xe2\x80\xa2b3xy\xe2\x80\xa2b4x2\xe2\x80\xa2b5y2\nFigure 7 shows a resampled image of figure\n2\t\nusing\t\nthe above polynomial mapping\nfunction with the nearest neighbor\ntechnique.

This technique can also be\napplied to images with small shearing and\ngeometric \'distortions (such that in the\ndomain of an object the shearing- and\nnegligible).\ngeometric\t\ndistortions\t\nis\t\nearth\nImages with distortions due\t\nto\t\nrotation, earth curvature, and scanner\nnonlinearity can be registered using this\ntechnique.\nMore research is required to see the\nfeasibility of this technique in\nregistering images obtained by different\nsatellites and/or different sensors.\nVII.
