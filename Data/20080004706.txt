In one practical application of\nto a preselected trickle value.\nthe proposed switching structure, the recessed portion\nFIG. 2 illUstrates, as PreviOUslY noted, a typical curve\n13a has a reduced thickness of approximately one-half\nof oxygen pressure versus returned state-of-charge for a\nof the 15 mil thickness of the typical nickel-cadmium\nnickel-cadmium cell during recharge.

This would prevent the nickel-cadmium cell\nduring recharge.\nfrom becoming permanently deformed and also help 65 Overlying the cell casing 13 is a support or stiffener\nprevent any deformation of the external stimulator casplate 40 fabricated of a structurally rigid material, such\ning structure (not shown) which is typically employed\nas steel. The plate 40 is formed with a circular recess\nin such implanted biomedical devices to hermetically\n40a which overlies and surrounds the reduced portion\n\n4,275,739\n13a of the cell casing, so as to form a chamber 41 in\ncommunication with the reduced portion P3a. The stiffener plate 40 is also formed with a suitable U-shaped\nnotch 40b at its right-hand end FIG. 5, defining an\nelectrical connection location at which leads 42 can be 5\nconnected to the switching structure to provide the\ncontrol indication of when the oxygen pressure within\nthe casing has increased to the point corresponding to a\nreturn of the battery to its fully charged state.\nMore specifically, a thin suitable pad 43 of electrical 10\ninsulator material, such as a ceramic, extends along the\nunderside of the recessed portion 40a in the stiffener\nplate 40 from the U-shaped access location and into the\nchamber 41 between the reduced portion 13a of the\nbattery casing and the stiffener plate recess Ma. 15\nMounted on this insulator pad 43 is a thin strip 44 of\nsuitable conductor material; e.g. a gold alloy, which\nfunctions as the electrical contact member against\nwhich the casing portion 13a deflects into contact to\nindicate the fully charged condition of the cell. The 20\nright-hand end of the conductor strip 44 is extended out\nthrough the U-shaped access location 406,for example\nby means of a connected conductor strip 45 of comparable width which, in turn, is mounted on top of a second\ninsulator pad 46 secured to the upper surface of the 25\nbattery casing 13.\nIn operation of the second embodiment of the proposed switching structure, when the rechargeable cell\nhas been returned to its fully charged condition, by the\nrecharging current supplied through the charge control 30\nswitch 22 (see FIG. l), the internal oxygen pressure of\nthe cell will cause the reduced thickness portion 13a of\nthe casing to deflect upwardly, as represented by the\ndashed lines in FIG. 6,so that it contacts the conductor\nstrip 44 carried on the stiffener plate 40. If desired, to 35\nassure good electrical contact with the conductor strip\n44, the upper surface of the recess 13a may be plated\nwith gold and, in addition, be fabricated with sharpened\npoints for enhancing electrical connection. As shown in\nFIG. 6, when the cell 13 is thus returned to its fully 40\ncharged state, the conductor strips 44-45 are shorted\nelectrically to the casing 13 and an electrical short thus\noccurs across wires 42. As previously noted, this occurrence represents a control indication of battery state-ofcharge and is used here to control the recharge control 45\nswitch function 22 to disconnect the recharging current\nto the rechargeable cell 13. Preferably, the chamber 41\nbetween the casing 13 and the stiffener plate 40 is hermetically sealed to prevent the infusion of foreign matter which might interfere with proper switch operation. 50\nAs previously mentioned, the spacing between\' the\nupper surface of the casing portion 13u and the conductor strip 44 is preselected so that contact therebetween\nindicates when the rechargeable cell has been returned\nto its fully charged condition, so that the recharge con- 55\ntrol circuitry may be operated to decrease the recharging current.\nFrom the foregoing disclosure, it should be clear that\nthe present invention provides a switch structure capable of sensing when a rechargeable battery or cell has 60\nbeen recharged to its fully charged condition by detecting deflection of the cell casing which occurs, as a result\nof increased internal gaseous pressure, when the cell has\nbeen returned to a fully charged state. It should furthermore be noted that this sensing has been performed 65\nwhile maintaining the integrity of the cell casing; e.g. no\nvent hole is required to sense the internal pressure of the\ncell. This obviously is desirable in that the cell remains\n\n6\n\nhermetically sealed and is thus rendered better suited\nfor applications wherein the cell supplies operating\nenergy to implantable biomedical systems such as cardiac pacemakers and human tissue stimulators.\nVarious modifications, adaptations and alterations to\nthe present invention are of course possible in light of\nthe above teachings. It should therefore be understood\nat this time that within the scope of the apended claims,\nthe invention may be practiced otherwise than was\nspecifically described hereinabove.\nWhat is claimed is:\n1.
