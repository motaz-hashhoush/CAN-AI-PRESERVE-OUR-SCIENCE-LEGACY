The morphology of storms is concerned with these transitions\nIn form of the field with time. The geomagnetic-field patterns of\ndisturbance, almost always present in some degree, have been measured\nuntil recently. only at the earth\' a surface, but there now appear fleeting\nindications of the form of the disturbance field and its associated\ncharged particles in nearby apace from observations by various space\nprobes and earth satellites. The present article is intended to\nprovide a suimry of\t\n\nof the better known and well established\n\nfeatures of the morphology of storms.\nA magnetic storm often has a audfien beginning, known as a sudden\ncozencement, which has a world-wide field pattern related to the\nposition of the sun. The onset Is sudden to about one minute or less\nthe world over, and the field changes tend to involve an increase in\nthe northward horizontal intensity H of some tens of gaima above\nnormal. The onset is usually greatest in polar regions. There Is often\nmagnification of the initial increase by a factor two or so on the\nsunvard side of the earth along the magnetic equator.\nIn low latitudes, the initial change in H, usually positive,\nmay be maintained and even increased over an hour or so to form an\ninitial phase of the storm. The value of H then decreases and reaches\na minim (below the normal value) about 15 to 20 hours after th. sudden\n\nlv\n\ncocemnt\n\nTh vi.ue of thea retur to ort1 over a period of\n\n&y3.\n\nThe polar dIsturbance field during bays tends to rotate sttard\nvith time at a rate of order O ___ O of longitude per hour at, or just\nnorth of, the auroral zone. Outside the zones currentpatterns appear\n\nto drift eastward. There is also evidence of a sloe drift to the east\nof the eastuard-directed electrojet at the auroral zone.\n\n1\n\nI. INTROIXYCTION\nIt viii be the aim here to sununarize briefly a number of the major\ndescriptive features of magnetic (earth) storms. An atteurpt viii also be\nmade to integrate some recent rocket and satellite magnetometer measure.\nments in a systematic way into the previous surveys of the morphology of\ndisturbance (Chapman and Bartels,\n\nl9I4O Veatine, et al, 197\n\nSugiura\n\nand Chapman, 1960; Akasofu and Chapman, 1961). Finally, some electric\ncurrent configurations and their driving forces are discussed.\nGeomagnetic time fluctuations or disturbances, often on a. world..\nwide scale, frequently appear superposed upon the no2ma]. geomagnetic\nfield present during magnetically quiet periods. The changes in the\nfield pattern with geographic position during the course of time\nconstitute the morphology of disturbance. The more intense disturbances\nare known as storms.\nMagnetic disturbance is most intense within two belts or zones\nencircling the earth near geomagnetic latitudes \xc2\xb1 670, where aurora also\nappear with highest frequency and intensity. These so-called auroral\nzones are ova], in form and in general a few degrees of latitude in\nwidth. In auroral regions, the field fluctuations are often oscillatory\nand irregular, and associated with irregularities in ion concentration\nin the ionosphere and with aurora. These irregular field changes with\ntime decrease rapidly equatorvards, and less rapidly toward the center\nof the aurora], zone. The aurora may slnni].taneoualy appear in several\nadjacent arcs near the average position of the auroral zone.\n\nThe disturbance field D includes parts which grow and then decay\nwith one pt (D5 ) displaying patterns depending mainly upon latitude\nand solar position, as well as a major part (D5t) that varies mainly with\ngeomagnetic latitude and ti reckoned from the beginning of a ttorm.\nThere is also an irregular part (D1 ) tbat is mainly related to (Ds). In\nthis notation D stands for disturbance field, S for solar, and st for\nstorm-time (Sugiura and Chapman, 1960).\nThe intensity of disturbance varies with tinie. In auroral regions\nit is apparently always present in some degree, and when weak may be\nlocalized at ground level or significant within an area only some\nhundred kilometers in linear cross section. Very intense disturbances\nmay appear locall , but then are usually apparent in some measure on a\ny\nworld-wide scale. When such world-wide disturbances become specially\nintense, they are called magnetic storms. These usually begin suddenly\n(in less than a minute) over the entire earth. Storms may recur more\nthan once in time sequence. In this case the onset or commencement is\nblurred, and may often be determined only to within an hour or so; the\nstorms may recur at intervals of about a solar rotation of 27 days, in\nwhich case they are called recurrent storms, The latter are apt to be\nless intense than many of the su&2en commencement storms (\xc3\xa7pman and\nBartels, 1910).\n\n3\n\nII. SUDD CC NCEMFN TB\nFigure 1 shows a fairly typical example of a sudden commencement\nstorm observed at Kakioka, Japan, on April 18, 1951 (Ka.miyama, 1952).\nThe sudden coiiunencement of about hO gazxmas (one gannna = l0 cgs-unit)\nIs clearly apparent as a rise in horizontal intensity (tangential and\nnearly northward). It will be seen that the field remains above the\npre-storm value for Borne hours. During the first hour or so the increase\ncan be ascribed to a shell of current in the Ionosphere (or described in\nterms of an associated field distortion). This current fla ys from vest to\neast and. is concentric about the geomagnetic or dipole axis of the earth.\nThe sudden commencement, In fact, usually ushers in an Initial or\npositive phase of the storm.\nThe amplitude of sudden conmencements varies both with latitude\nand tinE of day. According to Oguti, the morpholor of a sudden\ncommencenEnt can be represented In terms of the signals from overhead\ncurrent patterns of the type shown in Fig. 2, as viewed from directly\nabove the north geomagnetic pole In northweStern Greenland (Oguti, 1956).\nIn the initial impulse, above the pole the current flows away from the\nsun so that the magnetic field will be directed roughly toward the dawn,\nor 6:00 a. rn., meridian. This feature may give a preliminary reverse\nimpulse in the forenoon. In adjacent areas the field may be opposite\nin sense. Within a minute the patterns shown in Fig. 2(b) and (a) may\nhave appeared in sequence, growth from 2(a) being mainly due to the\naddition and superposition of an eastward flowing overhead current over\nthe entire earth increasing In intensity with time. The general features,\n\nat least in part, agree with other derivations of SC currents (Nagata\nand Abe, 1955 Jacobs and Obayaehi, 1956). The results also seem\ncompatible with other estimates of time variations of the field (Newton,\n\n198; Kato, 1952).\nA feature not indicated is the augmentation of the SC field, by\na factor about two, at the magnetic equator (Sugiura, 1953; Forbush and\nVeatine, 1955). This is explained in terms of more intense equatorial\ncurrents flowing in the low ionosphere along the magnetic equator (Jacobs\nand Obayashi, 1956). Highly localized intense features may accompany a\nsudden commencement or sudden impulse in the polar regions.\nIt will be clear that a part may be interpreted in terms of\nlocalized currentB or atmospheric sources both in polar regions, and\nalso near the magnetic equator, and a part to sources at higher levels.\n\nIII. INITIAL PHASE OF SOI1S\nThere is considErable variability from storm to storm in the\ncharacter and intensity of the earliest changes or initial phase of a\nstorm. In general, a representation in terms of a current pattern such\nas Fig. 2(c) as drawn for sudden commencements, is often appropriate.\nThe general pattern may persist for some minutes to several hours.\nIn the case of recurrent storms, often at about a 27-day interval,\nroughly that of the solar rotation, the onset of disturbance Is usually\ngradual and may be irregular and uncertain within a factor of an hour\nor so In time.\n\n6\n\nIV. MAIN PHASE OF STORMS\nIn the main phase of storms, the representation by currents gives\nrise to a principal current averaged around parallels of magnetic\nlatitude directed from east to west. The present information is meager,\nbut it appears to be in the form of a ring current above the ionosphere,\nas judged by the magnetic measurements of Vanguard III (ppner, et al,\n1960). The maximum decrease in the northward horizontal field\noften occurs about 16 to 20 hours after the onset of the storm, after\n\'.hich the field recovers to a normal value over a period of some days.\nFigure 3 illustrates the general form of the field derived by Nagata and\nFukuahima for a particular instant of the main phase of the storm of\nMay 1, 1933 (agata and Fukushima, 1952; Fukushima, 1953). The polar\nintensifications at the auroral zone may last for one to three hours,\nrepetitive at the same locality on several successive nights during the\nmain and. recovery phases (Chpman and Bartels, 19140). Pulsations in\nfield, both regular and irregular, of period a few tenths of a second\nto several minutes, usually appear during a storm noted at a high\nlatitude station (Kato and Watanabe, 1957; Kato, 1959). Occasionally\nthese are accompanied by auroral pulsations in illumination (Campbell,\n1960; Vestine, 19113).\n\nId\n\nV. SIMULTAIEITY OF NORTh AITh SOUTh POLAR DISIURBAIWES\n\nNagata and his students have recently studied the simultaneity\nin polar electrojet effects at Baker Lake, Canada, geographic position\n(61i\xc2\xb0 18\' N 9O 05\' w) and Little Anerica (78\xc2\xb0 18\' 3, 162\xc2\xb0 10\' w)\n\n(Nagata and Kokubun, 1960). Machine calculations give for a Baker Lake\nmirror point at height 100 km the conjugate (75\xc2\xb0 36\' 5, 172\xc2\xb0 Ii0\' w)\nwith mirror point height 266 km. At night, good correspondence is often\nfound between the time changes at the two stations, as shown in Fig. 1.\nThe correlation found was good on magnetically quiet days but poor on\nstorzzr days; the outer geomagnetic field may be more distorted and\nirregularly organized in the case of the latter.\n\nA\n\n8\n\nVI. MORPROLOGY OP STO P\'ThLD AT P0flTTS DISTAItTT FROM E EARTh\nAn irregularity in the geomagnetic field of about 1 O0 gaznmas was\nnoted by apace probe at a height of about 22,000 km (Dolginov and\nPusbkov, 1959; Antailevish and Shevnin, 1960). This measurement by\nrocket was made about 6 hours after the sudden beginning of a small\nstorm-type disturbance.\nFigure 5 shows an interesting result found by Sonett and his\ncolleagues in the flight of the space probe Pioneer V (Coleman, Sonett,\nJudge, and Smith, 1960). The magnetic-field time changes of some\ngammas detected appear to show correspondence with those recorded at\nground level at Ft. Belvoir, Va.\n\n9\nVII. ASSOCIATED CONJECTURAL MORPHOLOGICAL EVENTS\nAccording to the Chapman-Ferraro theory of storms and its modern\nextensions, a solar stream (or Parker\'s wind) interacts with the outer\ngeomagnetic field which becomes compressed and distorted.\nAccording to information supplied by Heppner and his co-workers,\nthe results of Explorer X suggest that blobs of gas may proceed from\nthe sun with a velocity of about 1O cm/sec (see COSPAR Bulletin No. 5,\npp . 17-25). Such blobs would cause transient distortions of the outer\ngeomagnetic field and, in fact, have been suggested previously on the\nbasis of\n\nsurface dAta,\n\nfor instance (Vestine, et al, 19 1e7, p. 362).\n\nThe effect of the distortion can be such as to produce a longitu&i.nal magnetic field gradient directed nearly sunward at dawn and\nevening, extending polewards from the equatorial plane. Such gradients\ncan give rise to separation of trapped protons and electrons in a radial\ndirection, and acceleration of such particles along field lines to\n\nproduce atmospheric currents, and an acceleration mechanism (Kern, 1961).\nIn the same way,\n\nduring initial\n\ncontact with the solar stream, these\n\ngradients cause particles to be driven into the polar caps to give\nthe localized features of the sudden conmencement field shown in\nFig. 1. The eastward-flowing component of the averaged system would\ncorrespond to the compression of field. On entry of solar-stream\nconstituents, as many have shown, the centrifugal force of protons\nshould expand the field to give the equivalent of an equatorial\nring current (Dessler and Parker, 1959). In the presence of longitudinal\ngradients, at first intense but shallov in depth, acceleration of\ntrapped radiation will ensue, to provide the polar electrojets. There\nuy also arise drainage and dissipation of the ring-current particles\n\n10\n\ninto atmospheric (ionospheric storm) regions in other latitudes as veil,\nin response to weaker gradients, broadly distributed in latitude and\ndepth. The possibility that electrons appearing below the E-region\narise, at least in part, in this nner is suggested even thoui the\nstorm-time electron content in the P-region shows a different morphology\n(Matsushita, 1959) .\n\nSome additional loss of protons may arise from\n\nreaction with hydrogen (Dessler and Parker, 1959). If the solar stream\nIs more intense, entry of protons may be In greater amount, so that\nexpansion of the field lines in the main phase Is more rapid, and the\ndecay period will also be more rapid in the presence of the greater\naccelerating action of more intense and widespread longitudinal field\ngradients, with contribution to Ionospheric storms and other phenomena.\nIn this war, the more rapid development in time of the rioua storm\nphases with increasing intensity of storm may be described.\n\nA\n\nVIII. CURRT SYST1 WRING INTSB\n\nSRN\n\nFigure 6 shows the approximate field vectors for the instant\n7 2, November 13, of the great magnetic storm of November 12-20, 1960.\nField changes are gradually being derived as more data reach the data\ncenters, but it is already apparent that field changes as great as 3000\ngammas (10 per cent change or more) in the horizontal field occurred at\nthe aurora), zone.\nFrom the figure, it is clear that the westward-directed polar\nelectrojet extended strongly around the night-time polar cap. This\ngreat surge of current shows a simple disturbance pattern, and currents\nbroadly distributed in latitude in auroral regions.\nIn the case of weaker electrojets of more localized character,\nthe drift in field patterns inside the aurora). zone is often clockwise,\nand opposite outside the aurora), zone, in the northern hemisphere.\nA study to be reported elsewhere gives the estimated average\nwestward drift velocity for polar westward-directed electrojets during\nfour weak disturbances (bays) as about 500 m/sec, and about 200 rn/sec\nfor the eastward-directed electrojet.\n\n12\n\nIX. SUMM\nThe morpholor of magnetic storms can be simply represented in\nterms of ionospheric current systems changing in form and intensity with\ntime. Using this model, the sudden commencement or initial phase of\nstorms at ound level will be due to a world-wide west-east circulation\nof current, plus two opposed atmospheric polar current circulations\nflowing away from the sun near each geomagnetic pole. After some minutes\nto an hour or more, the current systems reverse in sign and the two\nopposed polar circulations extend equatorwarda and develop electrojets at\nthe auroral zone. The latter tend to attain a maximum level in intensity\nprior to that of the main east-vest current flow on an average about l\nhours after the 8udden conmencement. In weaker storms the electrojets,\nenduring strongly for a few hours, may tend to be repetitive near the\nsame hour on several successive nights. Their advent may be preceded by\npulsations in field of some seconds to several minutes period.\nIn terms of transient distortions of the outer geomagnetic field by\nclouds of solar particles an equivalent model can be obtained which serves\nequally well for descriptive purposes. In this model, collision with a\nsolar stream compresses the geomagnetic field to within a few earth radii\non the afternoon side, 80 that the geomagnetic field carves out a hollow\nin the solar stream. ]Xzring the sudden comnencement and initial phase\nthere is then compression of field on the sunward or afternoon side, plus\ndistortions of field leading to sunward-directed magnetic field gradients\nin the equatorial plane acting upon trapped radiation shells. These\ntransient field gradients my produce separation of charges in sheets,\n\n13\n\nand there may occur in some way dumping of particles into the polar cap\nto produce electric currents in the E-region. During the main phase,\nthe geomagnetic field expands, possibly d.ue to entry of solar protons,\nand magnetic field gradients directed away from the sun appear and may\nproduce polar electrojets. These gradients, extending more deeply into\nthe geomagnetic field during great storms, may cause widespread drainage\nand dumping of particles into the low ionosphere causing radio wave\nabsorption. These stream-produced field gradients nay continue, less\n1oca.lied in pattern during the recovery phase of the storm over a period\nof days, aupplenmnting the loss of protons due to interaction with\nexospheric hydrogen. In this model short-period oscillations of the\ngeomagnetic field lines may locally assist the dumping of groups of\nparticles separated by field gradients.\n\nA\n\n\t\t\n\nIA\n\n>\'\n\n0\nE\n\n0\n\nH"\n\nE\n\n0\nU,\n\nc.\'J\t\n\n-o\n0\n\nC-,\r\nH\n\n0)\n\nC\n0\n\ncJ\t\n\nE\n0\n0\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2-g\n0)\n\n0\n0)\n\nc\'^;\n\n0\n\n0\n5.\n\n0\n\n2\t\n\n0)\n\nC\n0\n\nE\nco\n\n0)\n\n0\na.\t\n\n>..\n0.\n\n0\n\nLi\nLI)\t\n\nw\n\n0h\n15\n\n18\n\n72h\na\n.Q/)\n\nI 8"\n\nb\nQh\n\n,8h\n\n6\n\nFig. 2.
