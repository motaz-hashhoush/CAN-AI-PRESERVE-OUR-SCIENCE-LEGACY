The mission is based in the Philippines from late August through early October 2019. This presentation is aimed at 8-12th grade students in the Philippines for education/outreach purposes to expose students to NASA Earth and Airborne Science research, the CAMP2Ex mission, and careers in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM).The presentation starts with an overview of NASA Earth science, including discussing how and why NASA studies the earth using satellites, airplanes, and sensors on the ground. We discuss the NASA Airborne Science Program and how NASA uses airplanes to study the Earth from the equator to the poles. We discuss the CAMP2Ex mission specifically, including mission science goals and why we are based in the Philippines. We will discuss basic cloud physics and remote sensing using demonstrations and activities. Finally, we discuss careers in STEM and at NASA, giving personal examples of the career paths of scientists, engineers and pilots on the CAMP2Ex mission.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 20190032145, "id": "7cd98202340a4a2d9d9f232cbc27bc3b", "publicationDate": "2019-09-09T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20190032145.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20190032145/downloads/20190032145.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20190032145/downloads/20190032145.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20190032145/downloads/20190032145.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
