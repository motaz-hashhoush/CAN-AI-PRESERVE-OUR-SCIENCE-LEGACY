ABSTRACT\n\nThis final report describes the work performed under the delivery order No. 87 from June 1993 to\nJanuary 1995. The purpose of this contract was to provide optomechanical engineering and\nfabrication support to the Solar X-ray Imager (SXI) program in the areas of mirror, optical bench\nand camera assemblies of the telescope. The Center for Applied Optics (CAO) worked closely\nwith the Optics and S&E technical staff of MSFC to develop and investigate the most viable and\neconomical options for the design and fabrication of a number of parts for the various telescope\nassemblies. All the tasks under this delivery order have been successfully completed within\nbudget and schedule.\nA number of development hardware parts have been designed and fabricated jointly by MSFC\nand UAH for the engineering model of SXI. The major parts include a nickel electroformed\nmirror and a mirror mount, plating and coating of the ceramic spacers, and gold plating of the\ncontact rings and fingers for the camera assembly. An aluminum model of the high accuracy sun\nsensor (HASS) was also designed and fabricated. A number of fiber optic tapers for the camera\nassembly were also coated with indium tin oxide and phosphor for testing and evaluation by\nMSFC.\nA large number of the SXI optical bench parts were also redesigned and simplified for a\nprototype telescope. These parts include the forward and rear support flanges, front aperture\nplate, the graphite epoxy optical bench and a test fixture for the prototype telescope. More than\nfifty (50) drawings were generated for various components of the prototype telescope. Some of\nthese parts were subsequently fabricated at UAH machine shop or at MSFC or by the outside\ncontractors.\nUAH also provide technical support to MSFC staff for a number of preliminary and critical\ndesign reviews. These design reviews included PDR and CDR for the mirror assembly by\nUnited Technologies Optical Systems (UTOS), and the program quarterly reviews, and SXI\nPDR and CDR. UAH staff also regularly attended the monthly status reviews, and made a\nsignificant number of suggestions to improve the design, assembly and alignment of the\ntelescope.\nFinally, a high level assembly and alignment plan for the entire telescope was prepared by UAH.\nThis plan addresses the sequence of assembly, the required assembly and alignment tolerances,\nand the methods to verify the alignment at each step during the assembly process. This assembly\nand alignment plan will be used to assemble and integrate the engineering model (EM) of the\ntelescope. Later on, based on this plan more detailed assembly and alignment procedures will be\ndeveloped for the lower-level assemblies of SXI.\n\n2.0\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe Solar X-ray Imager (SXI) is a telescope being developed to operate from orbit aboard a\nGeostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES). Its mission is to monitor the X-ray\nspectrum of the sun and transmit video images to the earth in near real time. The precise\nalignment of the optical elements, accurate records of any misalignments-alignments and the\nstability of these elements over the mission lifetime is critical to the image quality.\nThe spacecraft will provide solar pointing platform and control to maintain the SXI boresight to\nthe center of the solar disk to within 3 arc-minutes in elevation, and 3.5 arc-minutes in azimuth.\nThe telescope will permit near real-time reconstruction of the solar images in the spectral range\nfrom 6 to 60 A. The spatial resolution of the SXI is sufficient to allow reconstruction of solar\nflares, loops and coronal holes.\nThe telescope consists of a monolithic grazing incidence type mirror with a paraboloid and a\nhyperboloid sections in Wolter type I configuration. The mirror focuses an image of the sun on a\nx-ray image detector through one of a set of filters. A high accuracy sun sensor (HASS) is used\nto monitor the solar aspect angles relative to the SXI line of sight. The overall size of SXI is 9.5"\nin diameter x 30" long, the total weight of the telescope is about 16 kg, and the power budget is\nabout 40 watts. Figure 1 shows the overall SXI assembly, while figure 2 is an exploded view\nshowing all the major parts of the telescopes.\n\n3. 0\n\nSXI MIRROR AND MOUNT\n\nThe CAO/UAH played a major role in the design and development of the mirror assembly for\nSXI. At the start of SXI program, the mirror assembly was designed to be installed to the\noptical bench by reaching through the graphite epoxy tube. The MSFC Optical branch and CAO\nwere opposed to this concept because it posed serious risks to the mirror during installation.\nMoreover, if the mirror assembly had to be removed for some reason, it would have required\ndisassembling the entire telescope. Therefore, CAO and MSFC jointly developed a design\nconcept for a front-mounted mirror assembly to alleviate these problems. The design and\ndevelopment work performed by CAO for the mirror mount and the electroformed is briefly\ndescribed in the following sections.\n\n3.1\n\nSXI NICKEL MIRROR\n\nThe flight mirror of SXI is made form zerodur and is mounted in a titanium mount, which is\ndesigned to provide differential thermal expansion over extreme temperatures encountered in\nspace as shown in figure 3. The engineering model mirror manufactured by UTOS was not\n\no:\nLJ\no\n<\n\n<o\n\no\noo\n\nCM\n0)\n\nCO\n\n2\n\nLLJ\nCO\nCO\n<\nCC\n\no\nOC\no:\nX\n\nCO\n\nen\n60\n\xe2\x80\xa2H\nfa\n\nscheduled to be fabricated until the end of 1994, and does not have the finished and coated\noptical surface. Therefore, MSFC asked CAO to fabricate a prototype nickel mirror, which could\nbe used for preliminary assembly, alignment and testing of the engineering model telescope.\nA prototype nickel mirror was designed and fabricated by UAH using the electro-forming\nprocess. A 3-piece mandrel, shown in figure 4, was designed and fabricated from aluminum for\nmaking this electroformed mirror. A number of other parts such as a rotator assembly and a\nfixture to diamond machine the mandrel were also designed and fabricated. The mandrel was\ndiamond machined to match the parabolic/hyperbolic surfaces of the actual mirror. The 3-piece\nmandrel was then nickel plated, and polished to a surface finish of better than 20 A. It was then\ncleaned and gold plated. Later on, the mirror with a wall thickness of about 1 mm was\nelectroformed on this mandrel, and cryogenically separated from it. A picture of this gold plated\nnickel mirror is shown in figure 5. Initially, we were planning to precision machine a reference\nsurface on the OD of the mirror to align it into its mount, but the mirror separated from its\nmandrel prematurely and the machining could not be performed.\n\n3.2\n\nSXI MIRROR MOUNT\n\nThe design of the prototype mirror mount is quite similar to the flight mirror mount being\nfabricated by UTOS. To minimize the cost of fabrication, a number of changes were made to\nsimplify the design. The mirror mount has three ears, and it can be installed on the front flange\nwith three shoulder screws from front of the telescope. The dowel pins have been eliminated, and\na number of other changes were also made to accommodate the mounting of a thin nickel mirror\ninstead of a thick zerodur mirror.\nThe mirror mount consists of a mounting flange, which interfaces with the forward support ring\n(FSR) of the telescope as shown in figure 6. Six fingers from this flange support a continuous\nring for holding the mirror. The inside surface of this ring is machined conical to match the outer\ndiameter of the mirror. The mirror mount was made from 316 CRES because its CTE matches\nthe CTE of nickel very closely.\n\n3.3\n\nSXI PROTOTYPE MIRROR ASSEMBLY\n\nA special fixture plate was designed and fabricated to support the mirror at a proper height in the\nmount for bonding. The plate was diamond machined to minimize the tilt of the assembled\nmirror relative to the interface pads on the mirror mount. The layout drawing (SXI 0092)\nshowing the setup for mirror bonding is included in the appendix 3.\nThe electroformed prototype mirror was assembled in its mount using the fixture designed for\nthis purpose. The mirror was placed on the diamond machined surface of the fixture sitting on a\n\no\ni= <\xc2\xa3\n\xc2\xa3o\n-JtE\n\n\xc2\xa3>\xc2\xa3\nS X\n~ 2\nv\n\n11,\n\n\xe2\x80\xa251 j\n**i\n\n.0\n$,\n\ng jf\n\n(/)\n\nQ\n\nJ\n\nf^J\n\nKl*\nUjfe\n\nl\nl\n\n(!)\nt-l\n\noo\n\nFigure 5.

The mirror mount was then positioned properly relative to the mirror. A\nsuitable adhesive was used to bond the mirror to the mount at six locations around its\ncircumference. The adhesive was allowed to cure at room temperature for 3 days. This completed\nmirror assembly, shown in figure 7, is now being integrated in the engineering model telescope.\n\n4.0\n\nSXI CAMERA ASSEMBLY\n\nThe CAO/UAH provided crucial technical support to MSFC in the coating and plating process\ndevelopment of a number of components of the SXI camera assembly. These components\ninclude the fiber optic taper (FOT) located between the micro-channel plate (MCP) and the CCD,\nthe ceramic spacer between the MCP and the FOT, and contact ring and fingers. A very accurate\nprocess control was required to deposit the indium tin oxide (ITO) transparent conductive\ncoating on the FOT to achieve a low enough resistance.\nThe ceramic spacer had be lapped flat and parallel before depositing a thick copper plating. The\nceramic spacers for the camera assembly were coated (vacuum deposition) with chromium and\ncopper to improve adhesion for a subsequent plating process. Then, a 0.0015" thick layer of\ncopper was plated over the entire surface. These spacers were then lapped flat. Four of these\nceramic insulators were photomasked and etched by Max Levy. These insulators rings were then\ngold plated and delivered to MSFC for assembly into the EM detector stack assembly.\nThe Be-Cu contact rings and finger for the camera assembly were also plated with the soft gold.\nThe procedure for plating these parts for the flight assembly was also completed and submitted to\nMSFC.\nA preliminary procedure for fabricating these parts for the flight model has been prepared. This\npreliminary procedure was discussed with SXI QA to identify the critical inspection steps during\nthe fabrication. The detailed procedures for plating of the spacers, contact rings and fingers are\ndescribed in appendix 3.\n\n4.1\n\nPHOSPHOR COATING OF FIBER OPTIC TAPER\n\nThe Chemical Engineering department of UAH was involved in identifying a suitable type of\nphosphor coating for the fiber optic tapers, and developing a procedure for applying this coating.\nThe red phosphors coating evenly covers the FOT, and adheres to it in the form of a thin strong\nlayer. A brief description of the work performed by them is as follows:\n\n10\n\n4.1.1\n\nAPPROACH\n\nA coating was developed using polyvinyl acetate (PVA) and cellulose acetate. A number of\ndifferent solvents were tested to dissolve PVA and cellulose acetate. Methyl ethyl ketone and\nethyl acetate were the two solvents that dissolved PVA and cellulose acetate, and made a strong\ncoating that did not flake or scratch off easily. This coating mixture was then mixed with the red\nphosphors for the purpose of covering and adhering to the FOT. The ratio of PVA or cellulose\nacetate to red phosphors was varied to obtain a stable coating that did not flake or scratch off\neasily. The red phosphors were filtered according to the particle size to obtain an evenly coated\nlayer of phosphors. The phosphors were filtered using a syringe filtering system and a particle\nsize distribution was obtained as shown in Figure 8. These coatings were reapplied using one\nparticle size per coating.\n\n4.1.2\n\nSELECTING A COATING\n\nOnly the strongest PVA and cellulose acetate coatings were selected. The selected coatings\nadhered to the FOT easily and did not flake or powder off. The phosphors and coatings were\nfirst applied to glass slides at different concentrations to obtain the most stable coating. A\ncoating of cellulose acetate with red phosphors was one coating that was strong and stable when\napplied to a glass slide. The same coating was applied to the FOT but was not as stable on the its\nsurface. As a result, this coating was not used on the FOT for the final coating. On the other\nhand, the PVA coatings adhered well to both the slides and FOT and was used on both of the FO\ntapers in the final coating. The composition of the two final coating were:\nCoating the FOT with a # 19-221-12996:\n1.52g Solution (made of 0.13g PVA and 2.69g ethyl acetate)\n1.86g Red phosphors (size between 1 urn-Sum)\nCoating the second FOT:\n0.5g Solution (made of 0.7g PVA and 1.12g methyl ethyl ketone)\n0.72g Red phosphors (size between 3um-8um)\n\n4.1.3\n\nAPPLYING THE COATING\n\nThe first of the two coatings listed above was applied with the use of a machined ring designed to\nfit on the outer diameter of FOT. The ring made a raised wall of the desired film thickness at the\ntop of the surface to be coated. The coating mixture was then applied to the FOT, and a flat\nedge was dragged across the top surface of the ring giving the desired coating thickness.\nThe latter of the two coatings was applied by an air brush method. A second machined part was\ndesigned to rest on the FOT around the outer edge of the coating surface. This allowed the\n11\n\nA\n\nm\n\nE\n\n3\n\n00\n\nOl\n\n!-l\n00\n\xe2\x80\xa2H\n\nI\n\nA\n00\n\n00\nA\n\nin\n\nCM\n\nin\nd\n\nin\n\nCNJ\n\n|o\n\n12\n\ncoating to be applied to a smaller area on the FOT. The coating mixture was diluted with more\nsolvent and air brushed onto the FOT, one layer at a time until a even coating covered the surface\nof FOT in a thin layer.\n\n5.\n\nASSEMBLY AND ALIGNMENT PLAN:\n\nThe SXI telescope has been designed with a minimum number of adjustments to achieve the\ndesired alignment between the mirror assembly, HASS and the camera assembly. The optical\nbench consists of three major parts namely : the graphite epoxy tube, forward support ring (FSR)\nand the rear flange (RF). These parts need to be machined and assembled to a high accuracy to\nminimize the alignment steps during the assembly of the telescope. The only two adjustments\navailable for alignment during the assembly are:\n1.\n\nThree spacers between the RF and the focal plane assembly to adjust the focus for\nthe finite and infinite x-ray sources, and for the UV collimator used for alignment.\nThese spacers are designed for the adjustment of focus only, but may be used for\ntilt adjustment to account for any gross errors in the machining and assembly of\noptical bench parts.\n\n2.\n\nThe in-plane (x and y axes) fine adjustment of the CCD relative to the radiation\nshield. This adjustment is designed to align the centration and roll of the CCD\ndue to the assembly errors in the camera assembly.\n\nThe CAO/UAH has developed a detailed high level assembly and alignment plan, which\ndescribes the sequence of assembly for the optical bench, and all the critical tolerances for major\nassemblies and how these tolerances must be verified to achieve a functional and aligned\ntelescope. This assembly and alignment plan is attached as appendix 1.\n\n6. CONCLUSION\nThe work performed by UAH in support of the SXI program has been described in this report.\nThis research, design and development work was critical in resolving a number of technical\nissues relating to the development of engineering and flight model telescope. A number of\ncritical prototype parts and procedures were developed and fabricated for the SXI mirror and\ncamera assembly. UAH also provided technical support to the MSFC Optical Branch relating to\nthe work being performed by other MSFC groups and UTOS by attending several quarterly\nreviews, PDR\'s and CDR\'s, and submitting the comments and recommendations in writing to\nimprove the design and performance of critical SXI parts. A number of parts developed by UAH\nare being incorporated in the engineering model of the telescope. Later this year, some of the\nfabrication procedures developed by UAH will be used to fabricate the parts for the flight model\ntelescope.\n13\n\nAPPENDIX 1\n\nSXI ASSEMBLY\nAND\nALIGNMENT PLAN\n\nMSFC-PLAN-2266\n\nSolarX-Ray Imager (SXI)\n\nASSEMBLY AND ALIGNMENT PLAN\n\nOctober 1994\n\nSXI ASSEMBLY AND ALIGNMENT PLAN\n\nCONTENTS\n\n1.0 INTRODUCTION\n1.1 THE SXI TELESCOPE\n\n3\n3\n\n2.0 COORDINATES AND CONVENTIONS\n\n4\n\n3.0 SXI OPTICAL AND SENSING ELEMENTS\n3.1 Mirror Assembly\n3.2 MASS Assembly\n3.3 Focal Plane Detector Assembly\n\n8\n8\n8\n9\n\n4.0 TELESCOPE ALIGNMENT REQUIREMENTS\n4.1 Mirror Assembly/HASS Co-alignment\n4.2 Optical Axis Perpendicularly\n4.3 Image Centering\n4.4 Field of View Alignment\n\n9\n10\n10\n10\n10\n\n5.0 ASSEMBLY CONFIGURATION AND REFERENCES\n5.1 Alignment Configuration\n5.2 Alignment References\n\n10\n10\n11\n\n6.0 SXI ASSEMBLY AND ALIGNMENT PLAN\n6.1 Optical Bench Assembly\n6.2 MASS and Mirror Assembly to Optical bench\n6.3 Focal Plane Assembly to Rear Flange\n\n12\n12\n13\n14\n\n7.0 FLIGHT SPACER INSTALLATION\n\n17\n\nSXI ASSEMBLY AND ALIGNMENT PLAN\n\n1.0\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe Solar X-ray Imager (SXI) is a telescope being designed to operate from orbit\naboard a Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES). Its\nmission is to monitor the X-ray spectrum of the sun and transmit video images to\nthe earth in near real time. The precise alignment of the optical elements,\naccurate records of any misalignments-alignments and the stability of these\nelements over the mission lifetime is critical to the image quality.\nThe purpose of this document is to define a plan for assembling aligning all the\ncritical optical elements of the telescope, calibrating the inevitable\nmisalignments-alignments, and specifying the boundary of change that can be\nexpected during the launch and in the temperature extremes of space. Based on\nthis concept a more detailed assembly procedure will follow, which will describe\nthe assembly procedures and alignment techniques at a subassembly level, and\nthe calibration and inspection equipment to be used in this task.\n\n1.1\n\nTHE SXI TELESCOPE\n\nThe primary elements of the SXI telescope are the mirror assembly, the High\nAccuracy Sun Sensor (HASS), and the focal plane detector assembly. These\nelements are assembled to a graphite-cyanate ester cylinder, which serves as\nan optical bench and thermal / environmental shield. The optical bench provides\na mechanical interface to the GOES spacecraft through a telescope mount. This\nbracket mounts to the Instrument Mounting Panel (IMP), located inside the Xray Positioner (XRP) on the solar array yoke of the GOES, thereby providing a\ncontinuous solar pointing for the SXI.\n\n2.0\n\nCOORDINATES AND CONVENTIONS\n\nFigure 1 identifies the Solar / Equatorial Reference axes [E], the frame of\ninterest to the user, the frame from which the experiment is conducted. It is an\norbit referenced, solar oriented system whose X-axis lies in the orbit plane,\ninclined to the sun-line through an angle, beta (0). The Y-axis is positive toward\norbital north, and for this equatorial orbit, towards the polar north.\nFigure 2 shows the coordinate relationship between [E], the GOES yoke, and the\nSXI body axes [B]. In normal operational mode, [B] will be aligned in space as\nfollows: the X-axis will be on the sun line; the Y-axis will be in the southern\nhemisphere; and, the Z-axis will lie in the orbital plane. The solar array drive\naxis will be ideally aligned with orbital north, and the beta drive axis will lie in the\norbit plane.\nFigure 3 introduces the optical coordinate system [O] and relates it to [B]. The\norigin of this frame is at the focal point of the mirror, with XQ through the mirror\ncenter-line. The Y0 and Zo axes are aligned parallel to the columns and rows of\npixels on the CCD.\nThe SXI alignment involves the identification, translation, and measurement of\nthe relative misalignments between the various coordinate systems. The\nalignment procedure for SXI will involve the following steps:\n(1) identify a mirror optical axis alignment reference\n(2) measure the Xo(ref) with respect to mirror optical axis\n(3) assemble MASS and quantify the misalignment between MASS and\nmirror optical axis XQ\n(4) align and position the focal plane assembly to\n(5) center the CCD detector to XQ an<j\nThe alignment of the SXI telescope to the GOES and the pointing of the SXI by\nthe spacecraft is not included as part of this plan.\n\nCD\nX\n\ncd\nCD\n\no\nCD\nCD\n\nMH\n0)\n\nCO\n\nC\\2\n0)\nCUJ\n\xe2\x80\xa2 I\xe2\x80\x94I\n\nfe\nX\nCO\n\nCO\n\no\n\no\n\nco\n\n3\no\nCU\n\no\n\n00\n0)\n\n^\nQ\nO\n\nCO\n\n3\n\ntl\xc2\xa3)\n\n3.0\n\nSXI OPTICAL AND SENSING ELEMENTS\n\nThe basic coordinate systems are determined by the optical elements of SXI and\nthe gimbal geometry to the GOES experiment platform. They relate the sensing\nelements of the SXI to the solar target, and their alignments are critical for the\npointing accuracy. The following sections give brief technical description of\nthese elements, how their alignment is determined, and why they are\ncontributors to the alignment error.\n3.1\n\nMirror Assembly\n\nThe mirror assembly of the SXI consists of a paraboloid and a hyperboloid\nmirrors in a two-mirror grazing incidence configuration. The design consists of\na single Zerodur mirror element with both optical surfaces fabricated integrally,\nsix SUPER INVAR pads bonded to the mirror element, and a titanium mounting\nring consisting of six support fingers that are bonded to the SUPER INVAR pads.\nAn integral part of the mirror assembly is an alignment reference mirror Xo(ref)\non the leading edge of the main mirror. This alignment reference is optically flat\nto within one quarter of a wavelength. The area of the reference mirror is over\nfive (5) cm2 and it is suitable for autocollimation purposes.\nThe mirror assembly mounting ring provides a 3-point structural interface with\nthe Forward Support Ring (FSR) bonded into the optical bench of the telescope.\nThe three precision machined interface pads on the mirror mount are coplanar,\nand orthogonal to the axis of the mirror within 10 arc seconds.\nThe location of the optical axis of the mirror assembly falls within a circle of\nradius 0.0127 cm, as defined by the attachment pads of the mounting ring. The\nlocation shall be measured to within \xc2\xb10.0025 cm.\n\n3.2\n\nMASS Assembly\n\nAn alignment mirror is provided to permit boresighting of the HASS optical axis.\nThe normal to the alignment mirror is parallel to the HASS optical axis to within 1\n\n8\n\narc minute. The alignment knowledge of the MASS reference with respect to the\nsensor\'s optical axis is better than 5 arc seconds.\nThe HASS is mounted via a three-point mounting system. The axis of MASS is\nelectronically calibrated to be orthogonal to within 5 arc seconds of the plane\ndefined the 3 mounting points. The sun angle shall be sensed with respect to the\northogonal Yo and Zo axes with an accuracy of 1 arc minute.\n\n3.3\n\nFocal Plane Detector Assembly\n\nThe focal plane assembly components are: 1) a camera assembly, and 2) a\nstructural element that serves as housing for the detector.\nThe camera assembly is the major element and is an integral part of the focal\nplane assembly. The active elements of the camera assembly consist of an\nelectro-optical imaging system (detector stack), drive electronics (located on a\nhead board), and timing and video amplifier circuitry (located in the high voltage\npower supply). The stack includes a grid, the Micro-channel Plate (MCP), a\nphosphor coated Fiber Optic Taper (FOT) and the Charged Coupled Device\n(CCD), all located along the optical axis near the focal plane.\nThe housing provides for the mounting of the MCP, and fiber optic coupler/CCD\narray, radiation shield and head board. The camera housing will provide the\nmain structural interface with the optical bench of the telescope. The interface is\na 3-pad mount. The interface pads on the housing are lapped flat and coplanar\nto 0.0002" tolerance.\n\n4.0\n\nTELESCOPE ALIGNMENT REQUIREMENTS\n\nThe key factors that define the SXI telescope alignment requirements are: the\ntelescope performance (resolution, image blur and smear), pointing knowledge,\nand co-alignment with GOES. The following are SXI alignment requirements.\n\n4.1\n\nMirror Assembly/HASS Co-alignment\n\nThe alignment of optical axis of the MASS shall be checked to the mirror optical\naxis to be within \xc2\xb12.0 arc-min.\n\n4.2\n\nOptical Axis Perpendicularly\n\nThe optical axis shall be perpendicular to the focal plane detector to within 60\narc-seconds. The perpendicularity of the optical axis to the plane defined by the\nthree (3) interface pads of the mirror mounting ring shall be within 10 arcseconds.\n\n4.3\n\nImage Centering\n\nThe instrument shall maintain the optical axis centered on the focal plane\ndetector to within \xc2\xb110 arc-sec.\n\n4.4\n\nField of View Alignment\n\nOne dimension of the field of view shall be aligned with the interface plate to\nwithin \xc2\xb10.2 degrees.\n\n5.0\n\nASSEMBLY CONFIGURATION AND REFERENCES\n5.1\n\nAlignment Configuration\n\nThe optical bench assembly consists of a composite cylinder, forward support\nring (FSR) and rear flange (RF). The optical bench assembly provides a\nlightweight and stable mounting structure for the mirror, HASS and focal plane\nassemblies.\n\n10\n\nThe forward support ring and the rear flange are bonded into the forward and\nrear ends of the optical bench to provide the mounting interfaces between\noptical bench and the mirror / HASS and focal plane assemblies. The interface\nat FSR is through three precision raised pads. The parallelism (relative tilt\nbetween the forward support ring and rear flange) and the axial separation\nbetween the mounting surfaces will be measured to an accuracy 5 microns\n(0.0002\xc2\xb0) utilizing a three-axis coordinate measuring machine (CMM). It should\nbe noted that axial change in length of the optical bench due to moisture\nabsorption and temperature changes must be determined to within the required\ntolerances. This data will be utilized in alignment steps described below.\nCompensation will be made to the axial length data for the effects of moisture\nabsorption by the optical bench.\nThe mirror assembly and HASS are attached to the forward support ring at the\nfront end of the optical bench. The camera housing is bolted to the rear flange\nvia focusing spacers.\nAlignment of the SXI telescope to the GOES will be achieved using the HASS\nalignment reference mirror. This alignment is the responsibility of SS/L and is\nnot included as part of this plan..\n\n5.2\n\nAlignment References\n\nThe observation of the camera output and two optical reference mirrors will be\nutilized in the telescope alignment process.\nThe two optical reference mirrors will be utilized in the pointing alignment of the\nMirror Assembly to the HASS . These reference mirrors are defined as:\n1) the mirror optical axis reference mirror (Xo(ref)). The normal to this\nalignment mirror will be parallel to the mirror optical axis to within 10 arcseconds, and known to within \xc2\xb12 arc seconds.\n\n11\n\n2) the MASS reference mirror (X^HASS ref))-Tne normal to the alignment\nmirror shall be parallel to the MASS optical axis to within 1 arc minute and\nknown to within 5 arc seconds.\n\n6.0\n\nSXI ASSEMBLY AND ALIGNMENT PLAN\n\nThe SXI telescope has been designed with a minimum number of adjustments to\nachieve the desired alignment between the mirror assembly, MASS and the\ncamera assembly. The optical bench parts (tube, FSR and RF) will be machined\nand assembled to a high accuracy to minimize the alignment steps during the\nassembly of the telescope. The only two adjustments available for alignment\nduring the assembly are:\n1. Three spacers between the RF and the focal plane assembly to adjust\nthe focus for the finite and infinite x-ray sources, and for the UV collimator\nused for alignment. These spacers are designed for the adjustment of\nfocus only, but may be used for tilt adjustment to account for any gross\nerrors in the machining and assembly of optical bench parts.\n2. The in-plane (x and y axes) fine adjustment of the CCD relative to the\nradiation shield. This adjustment is designed to align the centration and\nroll of the CCD due to the assembly errors in the camera assembly.\n\n6.1 Optical Bench Assembly\n6.1.1 Telescope Mount\nBond the telescope mount (TM) to the optical bench using the precision\nassembly fixture such that the telescope mounting plane is orthogonal to the\nforward support ring to within 0.010".\n\n12\n\n6.1.2 Forward Support Ring (FSR) and Rear Flange Assembly\nAssemble the FSR and rear flange in the optical bench by using the same\nfixture. The two flanges must be located relative to each other to better than\n0.005" axially, and must be parallel to each other within 5 arc seconds (0.0002"\nover 7.63" oVa), and be rotationally aligned to within 0.2 deg.\nInspect the optical bench assembly on the Zeiss coordinate measuring machine\n(CMM), which has a resolution of 0.1 micron, and an accuracy of better than 2\nmicrons. The following critical assembly tolerances shall be inspected and\nverified:\nFlatness of FSR and RF:\nParallelism between FSR and RF:\nRel. rotation between FSR and RF:\nPerpendicularity of TM rel. FSR:\n\n< 0.0002"\n< 5 arc sec.\n< 0.2 deg.\nO.010"\n\nAlso measure the actual length of the optical bench between the FSR and RF\ninterfaces to an accuracy of 0.0001" (2.5 microns). The effects of moisture and\ntemperature on the length of the tube shall also be accounted for.\n\n6.2\n\nMASS and Mirror Assembly to Optical Bench\n6.2.1 MASS to Forward Support Ring (FSR)\n\nThe reference mirror on the MASS is orthogonal to the MASS optical axis to\nwithin 1 arc min and known to within 5 arc seconds. The MASS has three pads\nthat interface with the three pads on the forward support ring (FSR). The MASS\noptical axis is electronically calibrated to be perpendicular to the plane of these\npads to within 5 arc seconds. The set of three HAAS mounting pads on FSR is\nmachined flat and coplanar to within 0.0002" relative to the mirror mounting\npads on FSR, yielding a tilt error of less than 5 arc seconds. Therefore, the\nmaximum cumulative tilt error between the MASS optical axis and the FSR will\nbe 10 arc seconds.\n\n13\n\nThe roll alignment of the MASS relative to the telescope mount is controlled by\nthe clearance between the screws and the mounting holes in the MASS, and the\nlocation tolerance of the threaded hole on FSR. The maximum tilt error due to\nthis clearance can be 12 arc min ( 0.010" clearance over 2.800" center to center\ndistance).\nAssemble the MASS to FSR using appropriate hardware. The tilt alignment of\nMASS will be checked relative to the mirror optical axis after the next assembly\nstep.\n\n6.2.2 Mirror to Forward Support Ring (FSR)\nThe maximum tilt error between the mirror optical axis and it\'s mount is 10 arc\nseconds. As the maximum tilt error between the FSR and rear flange (RF) is 5\narc sec, therefore, mirror optical axis will be orthogonal to the rear flange within\n15 arc sec. Assemble the mirror assembly to the FSR using appropriate\nhardware.\n\n6.2.2.1\n\nMirror to MASS\n\nThe maximum tilt error between the mirror optical axis and its mount is 10 arc\nseconds. Therefore, the maximum tilt error between the mirror optical axis and\nthe MASS optical axis will be 20 arc seconds. Use a visible-light autocollimator\n(VLAC) to verify this assembly tolerance by autocollimating off of the edge\nreference mirror (ERM) and the reference mirror on the MASS.\n\n6.3\n\nFocal Plane Assembly to Rear Flange\n\nAn optical alignment and test station has been designed to align the focal plane\nassembly relative to the SXI mirror. This alignment setup includes a UV\ncollimator (UVC), a visible light autocollimator (VLAC) , a reference flat, an\nalignment microscope and a multi-axis tilt stage to support the telescope. The\ntilt stage has a total travel of +/-1.0 degree, and a resolution of 1 arc second.\n14\n\nInitially, the UVC, VLAC and reference flats are aligned to each other such that\nthe collimated beam from the UVC is orthogonal to the reference flat. The SXI\ntelescope is then mounted on the tilt stage and it is adjusted such that the ERM\nis orthogonal to the collimated UV beam. This alignment will be verified by the\nalignment microscope. Also, use the VLAC to check the tilt of MASS reference\nmirror at this stage. Next, proceed to verify the focus and tilt alignment of focal\nplane (these can not be adjusted), and to adjust the centration and roll of the\nCCD.\n\n6.3.1 Focus Adjustment:\nThe required thickness of the focus spacers to position the camera assembly at\nthe proper focal length will be determined by the following metrology and\nanalytical calculations:\nThe actual mirror focal length number supplied by UTOS, i.e. the distance\nbetween the mirror mount pads and the focal point of the mirror.\nThe actual measured length of the optical bench., i.e. the distance\nbetween the mounting surfaces on the FSR and RF. The effects of\nmoisture absorption and temperature on the length of optical bench will\nalso be taken into account.\nThe calculated distance between the MCP and the camera housing\nmounting pads based on the actual measurements of the parts. This\nmetrology will include the distance between the FOT face to the mounting\nflange, the thickness of ceramic insulator and the distance between the\ncamera housing mounting pads and the mounting surface of the FOT\nflange. All these dimensions will be measured to an accuracy of 1-2\nmicrons.\nThe optical effects of the sapphire window for the UV collimator.\nBased on these numbers, the required thickness of the spacers will be\ncalculated, and a set 3 spacers will be machined to this nominal thickness. Four\n\n15\n\nmore sets of the spacers will also be machined with +/- 10 and 20 micron\nvariation from the nominal thickness.\nThe camera assembly will be assembled to RF using the 3 spacers and\nappropriate hardware. The focus of the telescope will be verified by making sure\nthat the collimated beam of UVC focuses to the desired spot size on the CCD.\nThis desired spot size will be determined from the metrology of the mirror and\ndetector, and the analytical optical performance predictions.\n\n6.3.2\n\nTilt Alignment\n\nThe machining and assembly tolerances of the camera housing and the detector\nstack shall ensure that the MCP is parallel to the camera housing mounting pads\nto within 20 arc seconds. The three focusing spacers can be lapped or diamond\nmachined flat and parallel to within a tolerance of 0.0002", producing a tilt error\nof less than 5 arc sec. The total tilt error between the mirror optical axis and\nthe rear flange is less than 15 arc sec. Therefore, the maximum cumulative\n(RSS) tilt error between the mirror optical axis and the MCP face will be less\nthan 25 arc seconds, which is well within the 60 arc-sec tilt requirement.\nUse the UV collimator (UVC) to verify the tilt tolerance by tilting the telescope\nsuch that the UVC focused beam spot scans across the rows and columns of\npixels on the CCD. For an acceptable tilt of the focal plane, the spot size of the\nbeam must stay constant within one pixel, i.e. the spot diameter must stay within\nthe desired size on the CCD. This desired spot size will be determined from the\nmetrology of the mirror and detector, and the analytical optical performance\npredictions.\n\nIf the focus of telescope and tilt of the focal plane check out to be within the\nacceptable limits, then proceed to align the centration and roll of the CCD.\nOtherwise, disassemble the camera housing from the RF and adjust the\nthickness of spacers to correct for the focus and/or tilt errors.\n\n16\n\n6.3.3 Centering Alignment:\nAlignment capability between the CCD and the radiation shield will be utilized to\ncenter the CCD within +/- 7.5 arc-sec with respect to the mirror optical axis, and\nto rotate the CCD with respect to the telescope mounting plane.\nThe centering of the CCD will be achieved by observing the centroid of the\nfocused spot of the UV collimated beam on the CCD. The CCD will be adjusted\nin Y and Z axes (in-plane) until the focused beam is centered within the central 3\nx3 pixel square on the CCD.\n\n6.3.4 Roll Alignment:\nThe roll alignment of the CCD will be checked by scanning the UVC focused\nbeam spot on the CCD in a straight line by pivoting the telescope. The CCD will\nbe rotated relative to the radiation shield to ensure that the UVC beam spot\nscans across the CCD within the same 2 row and 2 columns of pixels to meet the\nroll requirement of 0.2 degrees (CCD relative to telescope mount).\nAfter completing the alignment of the CCD, bond it to the radiation shield to\nretain its alignment.\n\n7.0\n\nFLIGHT SPACER INSTALLATION\n\nFollowing the successful X-ray testing and calibration, the finite source spacers\nwill be replaced by the infinite source spacers. The thickness shall be\ncalculated using the finite source data. Then, close tolerance pins will be\ninserted through the detector housing into the rear flange to maintain the\nalignment and to provide repeatability.\n\n17\n\nAPPENDIX 2\nSXI DRAWINGS\n\n\xc2\xa9\n\nORIGINAL P^E IS\nOF POOR QUALITY\n\nCU\n\ns\no\n\nX\n\nJ-13\n\n3\nto\n\n0.-J\n\nz\nau\n*\nui\nac\na.\n\nM_a\nUJMU.\n1-13\nazt-\n\nA\n\nen\n\nCO\nUl\n\n**\n\nCQ\n\nto <:\nui o:\n1-1 (v\nQC Ul\nUIU.\nMUI\n\n!ii\nie\n\nS^\n\n<.\nui\nQ;\n\n2\xc2\xa3\n\nCQ\nO\n\nHfO\n\nui\non\n\nz _,\n\nOf.\n\n-\n\n-o\n\nuuj\n\nM\nUl\n\ns\n\nno:\n5x\n\no\n\nV)\n\nQM\n\nto\n\xe2\x80\xa2-\xe2\x80\xa2<\nUJ\n\n\xc2\xa3>-\n\nz>\xe2\x80\xa2-\xe2\x80\xa2.\nuz\n\n<ao\n\n_i\n\ns< c\n\nCVJ\n\nat\n\na\n\nx\'\nto\nUJX\n\n_inui\n_|OOL\n<r -M\n\na\n\nUl\n\nCZV)\n\ntf\n\nUJ\nCQUI\n\nUJUJ\n\no a. <t\n-, at\n\n\\c\n\n! =js\n\nZH\n\xe2\x80\xa2-\xe2\x80\xa2u.\n\nli\n\n%\n\nVO <\n\nx-\n\nfill!\n\nV)\n\nO;\nf\n\nO.\n\n3\n\nu\n\ntil\n\nui\n\nHi\n\no\n\nC5\n\nuio:\nSS\nuiu.\n\nui\n\nUl\n\n<x\n\nn\ng}\n\n08:\no\n\nHI\n\nHP)\n\nui\notot\n\non\n\no:\na:\n\nn\nui\n\nV)\nQi-t\n\nta\n\xe2\x80\xa2^\nin\n\nI\na.\n<t HO\n\nCO\n-IU1\n\nui u\n> a.\nuix _\n0\xc2\xa3W\ng\nz\n\n--\n\ng\n\nl-a\n\nMUI\n\nf IS\n\nUl\n\nCO\n\nu\njoa.\n< \xe2\x80\xa2n\n\nsd\n\nni\n\nif\n\xc2\xab\ni\n\n(\nt\n\nL_\n\n-n\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nt\n\nJJ ***\n!HH\n\n\xe2\x80\xa22\ng\nUJ\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 - \xe2\x80\xa2 M b .\n\nu. or:H\n-iB\n* 1*\nSo: \xc2\xab -gS \xc2\xabj\n\ny\n\nHa\n\n<ro S j\nji**" \'\n5w Qa . < cUJ t k X \xc2\xab a u d\n> Of \\. 4\nU lu\n03^\n\nPDC z\xc2\xab \xc2\xab,>_i _inu i-\n\n,S f S S S S i ^ f e S S\n\nu_\nCD\n\n<\n\nT\n\nCO\n\nCD\n\n<\nLd\n\n>-\n\nCD\n\n=i\n\ni\n^3\n\no\n\nu.\n\nct:\n\n<\n\no\nu\n\n><\n\nLd\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2z.\n\n^\n\ni^\n\n0\nCD\n\nCO\nCO\n\n.-*\xe2\x80\xa2\n\ng ^ CO\n\nz:\\ ct:\nHo ID\n\xe2\x80\x94; tO CD\nIjOJ\n\n< i<\nd\n\nro\nO\n\nCO\nLd\n0\n\n\'Q\nLd Ld\nCD LL.\n\n0&\nP Ld\nCL\n^ Q Ld^O\nQ Ld\n^Ld\'\nLd LJ_\noo\n\nCt\n\nK\n\n2: o\n\n^85\n\n^ ^ Q ^\n$%\n\nbo\n\nLd\n_J ^\n. -^ ^\nSO >CO ^ Ct rr co\nLd\nO Ld \\ Ld "" Ld\nH- Ct S O LO>X _i \xe2\x80\x941\n<Ld LdQ CN H - I j Z\n^Q.

S435002-817.\nThe tolerance and\nquality have been acceptable within this drawing and represents excellent product control.\nAttempts to alter the\nthickness at MSFC by lapping were not successful indicating\nthe parts must be ordered to specific drawing dimensions and\ntolerance.\nThe tolerance on parallelism and flatness must be reviewed\nand the final drawings must call for required tolerances.\nThese dimensions are not on the presently available\nS435002-818 drawing.\nThe tolerance of 0.001 inch parallelism and 0.0005 flatness need to be reviewed since marked\ncopies show 0.0005 and 0.000050 inches respectively.\nThe contact ring (S435002-818) is fabricated by coating and\netching processes similar to microcircuit and printed wiring\nboard procedures (PWB).\n\n1.1. Inspection and Acceptance of S435002-817: MSFC\nAll dimensions and tolerances at this stage should be met by\nINSACO, Inc.\nMSFC acceptance should be the three radii\n(diameters), parallelism of each side and the flatness. The\nradii can be measured with micrometers. The parallelism can\nbe measured on a granite flat plate with a micrometer height\ngauge such as Trioptics Spherometer or a measuring microscope such as the available Klinger at UAH. The flatness is\nmore difficult and needs to be verified prior to the parallelism. Four traces of each side using a profilometer such\nas the Rank Taylor Hobsen Talysurf used by UAH for the engineering models, will provide this data. After the heavier\ncopper coating is applied, it will be necessary to lap and\nremeasure the parts to achieve the same flatness and parallelism.\n1.2\n\nCeramic Substrate Inspection: INSACO Inc.\n\n10 PIECES\n\nInsaco shall provide individual component dimensional inspection data in an approved MSFC format.\nMSFC is to order the parts and perform individual part incoming inspection including X-ray requirements.\n\n2.0\n\nCoating Process: UAH\n\n2.1\n\nAdhesion Coating\n\n10 PIECES\n\nEvaporate chromium 200 - 500 angstroms plus 1500 - 2000\nangstroms of copper. Each side to be coated plus the extended end must be coated by tilting the part.\n2.2\n\nSample test\n\n2 PIECES\n\nTwo parts will need to pass an adherence test per MIL-G45204C section 4.5.2.3 Baking Tests. Bend tests are not applicable.\nThis test shall be monitored on the two test\nparts and the data recorded for MSFC QC.\n3.0\n\nCopper Electroplating and Lapping: UAH / MSFC\n\n3.1\n\n8 PIECES\n\nCopper plating requirements\n\n3.1.1\n\nThe copper plating shall be per MIL-C-14550, Revision\nB, Amendment 3, 20 Mar 87 or later as applicable.\n\n3.1.2\n\nThe electroplated copper must adhere to the vacuum\nevaporated copper.\nThe deposit thickness is to be\n0.0015 + /- 0.0003 inch.\n\n3.1.3\n\nThe chemical analysis shall include copper metal, sulfuric acid, chloride and a known addition of chemical\nbrightner suitable for high quality printed wiring\nboard (PWB) fabrication and shall be performed by MSFC.\n\n3.1.4\n\nTwo pieces must pass adherence test per MIL-G-45204C or\ntape pull test for paint equivalent per MSFC.\n\n3.2\n\nLap and Inspect Thickness and Flatness: UAH\n\n6 PIECES\n\n3.2.1\n\nLap with 3 micron aluminum oxide polishing compound on\nglass flat until thickness and parallelism tolerance is\nmet.\nRemove equal amounts from each side. Measure\nusing surface height gauge such as a spherometer.\n\n3.2.2\n\nLap with 1 urn aluminum oxide polishing compound until\nflatness requirement is met. Clean part prior to continuing. Measure using form profilomitry such as Rank\nTalor Talysurf. Remeasure parallelism at this point.\nRecord all data for review by MSFC QC.\n\n3.3\n\nCleaning and Inspection: MSFC and UAH\n\n6 PIECES\n\nUAH shall clean and inspect parts after all lapping and\ninspection is complete. UAH is to approve inspection\nprior to sending to MSFC. MSFC to approve inspection\ndocument to be delivered to Max Levy, Inc.\n\n4.0\n\nMasking and Etching Process: Max Levy Inc.\n\n6 PIECES\n\n(1)\n\nThe photomask must adhere to the copper plated parts\nand minimize undercutting.\n(2) Parts must be cleaned to specification and inspected\nprior to this subcontractor stage.\n\n4.1. Prepare dense photomask with PWB procedures: Max Levy, Inc.\n4.1.1\n\nPerform Incoming Inspection and record data.\nMSFC QC and UAH if discrepancies are noted.\n\n4.1.2\n\nPlot artwork.\n\n4.1.3\n\nPhotoreduce to tolerance if oversize process is used.\n\n4.1.4\n\nApply to part using alignment marks for reference.\n\n4.2\n\nInspection:\n\nNotify\n\nMax Levy, Inc.\n\n4.2.1\n\nInspect masked parts and record discrepencies individually. Subcontractors Inspection System is to be\ncurrently approved as conforming to the requirements of\nMIL-I-45208A by at least one other government (DOD or\nNASA) Contracter such as, but not limited to Ball Corporation, Hughes Aircraft Co., Martin Marietta\n(Lockheed Martin) or Northrup Corp. Evidence of such\ncurrent approval may be certified copies of acceptance\nletters or some other form agreed upon by MSFC or UAH.\nCurrent conformance is subject to review and approval\nby MSFC or UAH at all times prior to and during the\nperformance of the [proposed] contract.\n\n4.2.2\n\nSubcontractors Calibration System is to be currently in\nconformance to the requirements of MIL-STD-45662 and\nwill be subject to review and approval by MSFC or UAH.\nThe Subcontractor\'s signed certificate must indicate:\n(1)\n(2)\n(3)\n\n4.3\n\nTracebility to the National Institute and Standards\nTool or gage number\n[Proposed] contract number.\n\nEtch Pattern in Copper:\n\nMax Levy Inc.\n\n3 PIECES\n\n4.3.1\n\nUse PWB process - either ferric chloride or ammonium\npersulfate to be considered.\nNote that separate\nchromium etchant such as potassium permanganate or HC1\nmay be required to remove chromium adhesion layer.\n\n4.3.2\n\nRemove masking material. Inspect for signs of undercutting. Notify MSFC of results before continuing.\n\n4.3.3\n\nRepeat 4.3.1 and 4.3.2 with 3 pieces if unacceptable.\n\n4.3.3\n\nClean and inspect prior to packaging for shipment for\ngold plating. Shipping package to contain dessicant.\nNote:\n\n(1) Max Levy may quote gold plating since cyanide or noncyanide based plating is acceptable.\n(2) Non-cyanide processes will be used if MSFC/UAH performs\nthe gold plating.\n4.3.4\n\nProvide inspection\ndeliverable.\n\ndocumentation per MSFC contract\n\n4.3.5\n\nINSPECTION OPTION: MSFC or UAH may add source inspection at subcontractor\'s facility.
