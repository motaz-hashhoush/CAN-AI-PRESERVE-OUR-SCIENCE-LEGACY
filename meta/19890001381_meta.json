The Mg II region was investigated as a potential probe of atmospheric shocks, which are believed to be associated with the pulsational variability of this class of objects. Observations, a description of the spectra, and findings for V Vul and AC Her are presented. The Mg II emission does vary significantly during the cycle; major changes in the emission line strength occur on a time scale much less than 0.2 in phase; and as the UV (and optical) continuum flux increases, the Mg II lines decrease and increased emission may be seen at 2823, 2844, and 2900 A.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19890001381, "id": "e20b9d6277154601ba81fea01fa10bf3", "publicationName": "ESA, A Decade of UV Astronomy with the IUE Satellite, Volume 1", "publicationDate": "1988-06-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19890001381.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19890001381/downloads/19890001381.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19890001381/downloads/19890001381.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19890001381/downloads/19890001381.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
