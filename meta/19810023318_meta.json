The microcomputer technology reduces the system's physical size by the implementation in firmware of functions. The reduction in the number of components increases system reliability and similar benefit is derived when a graphic video display is substituted for several control and indicator panels. A substantial reduction in the number of cables, connectors, and mechanical switches is achieved. The microcomputer based system is programmed to perform calibration and diagnostics, to update the satellite orbital vector, and to communicate with other network systems. The design is applicable to antennas and lasers.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19810023318, "id": "5d08dd71cd114bc88e0db6d9fd94cefd", "publicationDate": "1980-10-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19810023318.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19810023318/downloads/19810023318.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19810023318/downloads/19810023318.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19810023318/downloads/19810023318.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
