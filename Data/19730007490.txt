aspects of lunar transport using the hopping mode.\nis attractive because it exploits the weak lunar gravity.\n\nHopping\nFor example,\n\nlaunching at 450 with a velocity of 15 ft./sec permits a horizontal\nleap of 50 feet in 4 sec, and launching at 45 ft./sec permits a leap\nof 450 ft. in 15 seconds.\n\nUse of a pneumatic piston propulsion system\n\nallows substantial fuel economy, since the propellant gas can be partly\nrecompressed upon landing.\n\nIn addition, hopping does not require a\n\ncontinuous smooth surface between termini, but can surmount intervening\nobstacles and crevasses as well as permit vertical reconnaisance hops.\nAmong the important questions which arise when one essays to design\na hopping vehicle are (a) the tolerance of a human pilot for repeated\naccelerations,\n\n(b) means for controlling vehicle attitude during bal-\n\nlistic flight, and\n\n(c) means of propulsion.\n\nTwo questions which are\n\nomitted from this report are the foot-soil interaction during acceleration, and acquisition of target point coordinates.\n\nAlthough the original\n\nhopper or lunar "Pogo" concept [1]* envisaged take-off at 1 earth g along\na 30-ft. pole, later desire to have a vehicle small enough to be carried\non Apollo resulted in the arbitrary decision to study a small hopper\nwhich accelerated at an average value of 3 earth g\'s through a 2-foot\ndisplacement only, permitting 50-foot hops.\n\nSubsequent work on the\n\nacceleration tolerance of primates indicates that this displacement\nshould probably be increased by a factor of two or three, with corresponding reduction in peak acceleration, to provide a satisfactory ride\nfor humans.\n\nNumbers in brackets indicate references listed at the end of this\nreport.\n\n1\n\nThe model chosen for attitude control during flight utilized\nthree sets of twin gyros which during flight could exchange angular\nmomentum with the vehicle around any of three orthogonal axes.\noperational modes were considered:\n\nTwo\n\n(a) pilot and vehicle at fixed\n\nhorizontal attitude with propulsion leg rotation 90\xc2\xb0 during flight\nfrom launch to landing orientation, and (b) propulsion leg fixed to\nthe vehicle, with entire ensemble, including pilot, rotating during\nflight to the landing orientation. The latter option was chosen for\nanalysis and simulation since it was mechanically less complex and\nresulted in the pilot\'s acceleration forces remaining fixed in his\nbody axes.\nThe propulsion system model comprised a piston and cylinder\nattached to a "foot" broad enough to stabilize angular motion around\nan "ankle" while the vehicle rested on the lunar surface.\n\nSpecified\n\nrange was achieved by careful adjustment of initial pressure in the\ncylinder.\n\nThe energy losses resulting from impact of the foot upon\n\nlanding were made up by adjustment of the mass of gas in the cylinder.\nTo confirm the hopping concept, a small-scale terrestrial demonstrator was built which used 2000 psia cold nitrogen as propellant\nand was stabilized passively about a vertical axis by a single gyroscope.\n\nFor simplicity, pneumatic shock absorbers were used for\n\nlanding rather than\n\nre-orientation of the propulsion leg.\n\nThis\n\nvehicle was able to perform about 20 ten-foot hops per filling of its\nN2 bottles.\n\nThese were equivalent to60-foot lunar hops.\n\nIn view of the limited Apollo program, preliminary study has been\ngiven to the possibilities of unmanned hoppers on the moon.\n\nBecause\n\nof the absence of a pilot, such vehicles could use much greater acceleration and be correspondingly compact.\n\nThey would, however, require\n\nmuch more sophisticated guidance systems, and if controlled by earthbased operators, be subject to the 1.5 second one-way time delay in\nexecution of commands.\n\nA possible operational plan for such an unmanned\n\ndevice is discussed in the final section.\nAll of the work described in this report was carried out in fulfillment of degree requirements by graduate students at Stanford\n\n2\n\nUniversity with the support of NASA;\ninclude [2 through 6].\n\nprevious reports on this work\n\nOf the work reported here, the study of effects\n\nof acceleration on primates was done by R. Degner, the attitude control\nsystem by S. Pasternack, the propulsion analysis by R. Meetin, the terrestrial demonstrator by S. Peterson, and the unmanned system by\nM. Kaplan.\n\nGeneral supervision of the work was shared by H. Seifert\n\nand J. Manning.\n\n3\n\nSection 2\n\nEFFECTS OF CYCLIC ACCELERATION PULSES ON PRIMATES\n\nIntroduction\nThe major consideration for selecting an acceleration profile\nfor a manned vehicle must be "Can the pilot take it?"\n\nAlthough\n\nearlier ballistics and propulsion analyses had been carried out [3]\nassuming take-off and landing acceleration pulses of 5 g maximum\n(3 g average) and 0.2 seconds duration, it had not been established\nthat a human could withstand very many cycles of this acceleration\nprofile.\nThere have been no previous studies of the effects on humans of\ncyclic acceleration pulses of the type encountered in hopping vehicle\noperation or of the basic way in which the design of a hopping vehicle\nis affected by its acceleration profile.\nmatters was therefore undertaken;\n\nAn investigation of these\n\nthis study proved so challenging\n\nand its results so significant that it became the principal focus of\ndissertation research [7].\nthree areas:\n\nThis study has involved the following\n\ndesign and construction of a cyclic acceleration facility,\n\nan experimental investigation of cyclic acceleration tolerance, and an\nanalytical study based on a mathematical model.\n\nCyclic Acceleration Facility\nNo acceleration test facility was available which could be programmed\nto produce cyclic acceleration pulses, so a facility was designed and\nconstructed.\n\nThere were not sufficient funds available to build a general-\n\npurpose facility with active control of the pulse shape.\n\nInstead, a\n\nspecial-purpose facility capable of generating cyclic acceleration pulses\nof 0.2 seconds in width and up to 5 g in magnitude with passive control\nof the pulse shape was designed and constructed.\nThe basic principle of the design is to reel a guided impact assembly\nupward with a drive train to some height, disengage the cable takeup spool\nfrom the rest of the drive train which allows the impact assembly to\n\n4\n\naccelerate downward under the influence of gravity, and stop the impact\nassembly with a hydraulic-pneumatic shock absorbing system mounted\nonboard.\nThree standard drop heights of 32, 50 and 68 inches were used during\noperation of the facility.\n\nFriction and drag limit the free-fall accel-\n\neration to about 0.8 g which results in impact velocities of approximately\n10.8, 13.9, and 16.5 ft/sec, respectively for the three drop heights.\nMaximum accelerations are 2.6, 3.8, and 5.0 g with a pulse width of about\n0.2 seconds in all cases.\n\nA three speed transmission in the drive train\nThe three cable takeup speeds coupled\n\ngives three cable takeup speeds.\nwith three drop heights result\nexperimental tests.\n\nin nine standard rides used in the\n\nThe rides are summarized in Table 1.\n\nExperimental Investigation\nThe original plan for this study was similar to that used in previous\nstudies of human tolerance to acceleration inputs, i.e., to start with\nlow acceleration intensities and short exposure times and then to increase\nboth up to the limit of human tolerance based on subjective reaction.\nA test protocol which included the plan to use human subjects was submitted\nto the Stanford University Committee on the Use of Human Subjects in Research.\n\nHowever, this Committee recommended preliminary animal tests\n\nsince this type of acceleration input had never been previously used with\neither animal or human test subjects.\nMonkeys were selected for this study because of their anatomic and\ndynamic similarity to humans.\n\nThese animals are dynamically similar to\n\nhumans in that [8]:\n1)\n\nthe major resonance of both is centered in the abdominal\nand thoracic viscera\n\n2)\n\nthe major resonance occurs at approximately 5 Hz in both primates\n\n3)\n\nthe major resonance is damped approximately equally in both.\n\nThe test animals ranged in weight from 12 to 20 pounds.\n\nA harness\n\nwas used to restrain the animals in a seated position but was not so\ntight as to appreciably affect their dynamic response.\n\nThe only padding\n\nused was 1/4 inch felt on the seat so that the accelerations measured on\n\n5\n\nthe impact assembly were very nearly the same as those input to the\nseat of the animal.\nThe animals were exposed to rides in order of ascending number\n(see Table 1).\n\nEach ride was continued for 1 hour, then a rest period\n\nof several hours was used before the next ride was input to the animal.\nNo more than two hours of exposure was given to any one animal on one\nIn most cases, the animals were subjected to rides on successive\n\nday.\ndays.\n\nAll of the animals were x-rayed before their first exposure and\nafter their last to check for dislocated or fractured bones.\n\nIn nearly\n\nall of the tests, the animals were sacrified 12 to 24 hours following\ntheir most intensive acceleration exposure. An autopsy was performed\non each animal and all.of the organs sent to a pathologist for microscopic examination. The spine is the most heavily loaded part of the\nskeleton, so it was excised in several animals and sent to an orthopedic surgeon for detailed examination.\n\nRide No.\n\nMax.

For all six\nof these tests, there was no evidence of pathology during the pre-autopsy\nobservation period.\n\nThere was some soft tissue damage in a couple of the\n\ntests (III and VII) but this was of a minimal to moderate degree and certainly not life-threatening.\nThe pathologists concluded that the most serious hazard to the\nanimals undergoing exposure to the accelerations was fat embolism.\n\nNone\n\nof the three animals exposed to only the first six rides (Tests V, VI, and\nVIII) contracted this disorder.\n\nHowever, all three of the animals exposed\n\nto total exposures of greater than eight hours (Tests III, IV, and VII)\nhad varying degrees of fat embolism.\nNo attempt will be made to cover all of the various aspects of fat\nembolism in this discussion.\n\nFor a more thorough discussion than that\n\ngiven here, the reader is referred to a recent paper by Levy[9] which\ndeals in some detail with the pathogenesis, diagnosis, treatment, and\nprognosis of fat embolism.\nEmbolism indicates the sudden blocking of an artery or vein (or\ncapillary) by a clot or obstruction, which has been brought to its place\nby the blood current.\n\nFat embolism is a disorder wherein fat droplets\n\nof size sufficient to occlude or block the small blood vessels of the\nvarious organs in the body appear in the circulating blood.\n\nIt is a\n\nfrequent and often serious complication in individuals who have been\ninjured.\n\nAlthough fractured bones are the commonest clinical association\n\nof fatal fat embolism in man, there is ample evidence that concussion of\nbones without fracture, and soft tissue injury, can lead to fat embolism.\nThe exact mechanism behind the formation of fat e;mboil\nHowever, the mechanical theory is the most widely accepted.\n\nis not known.\nAccoclrding\n\nto the mechanical theory, injury to tissues containing fat cells, such\n\n7\n\nas bones and soft tissues, ruptures the cells, releasing the fat in\ndroplet form.\n\nAt the same time, the capillaries and small veins\n\ndraining the injured tissue are disrupted, resulting in the entry\nof the fat droplets into the vascular channels.\nFat embolism kills because it impairs the function of many organs\nin the body, particularly the lung and brain, by interrupting their\nblood supply.\n\nIt is potentially a very serious disorder in that:\n\n1)\n\nminimal trauma can cause the formation of fat emboli\n\n2)\n\ndefinitive diagnosis by clinical tests is very difficult\n\n3)\n\nan asymptomatic period varying from minutes to hours following\ninjury makes tentative diagnosis difficult\n\n4)\n\nin the seriously ill patient with fat embolism, the mortality\nrate is near 100% without therapy.\n\nThe finding that fat embolism was the main hazard to the animals\nundergoing this experiment is remarkable in that no studies on acceleration tolerance were found in the literature in which fat embolism was\nlisted as a primary or even secondary hazard.\n\nThis is somewhat more re-\n\nmarkable when one considers that, even though fat embolism is always\nsecondary to injury or certain other diseases, an Austrian study [91\nof 263,861 injury cases in which 5,265 of the patients died found fat\nembolism to be the primary or a contributing cause of death in 16% of\nthe cases.\nMore animal experiments would have been very desirable to further\nestablish what combinations of exposure time and acceleration levels\nproduce fat embolism.\n\nHowever, the large amount of time and support\n\nneeded to conduct an extensive experimental program of this nature was\nnot available.\n\nAnalytical Study\nThe objective of the experimental study was to determine whether\nhumans could tolerate cyclic acceleration pulses of approximately 0.2\nseconds in duration and 5 g\'s in magnitude.\n\nHowever, the preliminary\n\nanimal experiments indicated the potential danger of subjecting human\nsubjects to these types of accelerations.\n\n8\n\nH\nV)\n\nI E-4\n)\n\nI E\n\nI\n\nIa\n\nU)\n.,\n\n0\n\nJ0\ndU\n\nI *t\n\n0\n\nI > hCl\nto\nI% .d\no U)0\n04\n0\n\nIC) 4\nN3\nC)U)\n\n$40\n\n:4oS\n\nTlo-(I\n\nasmwua poogl\n\nquau\n\nenssT;\no\n\nXu-X\n\nsuoT0Zoo0s(Ia\nI saa:vnjoa\n\nP)\n\n04\n\n{\n\nc\n00\ng:\n\nM\n-\n\nO0\n\nC)\n\ne\n\nI\n\nM\n\n=\n\nbo\n\n1\n4X\n\n4Ci\n\n4,\n\n(D\n\nI\n\no\n\n0\n\n.

These results\nThe nine experimental rides gave values of P\n\nindicate that a human would not tolerate any of the experimental rides\nfor more than a few minutes.\nWith respect to the experimental rides, it was also noted that\neven though the major forcing components were below 2 Hz in all cases,\nthose frequency components which contributed most to Pav were at\napproximately 4 Hz. In other words, if the experimental rides were\ninputted to a human, most of the absorbed power would be dissipated\nin the thoracic and abdominal viscera.\n\nSince monkeys are dynamically\n\nsimilar to humans, the fat embolism in the animals was likely caused\nby repeated damped oscillations of the thoracic and abdominal viscera\nwhich were forced by the acceleration input pulses.\nThe second phase of the analytical study was carried out using\nfunctional acceleration inputs to see if any pulse was better than\nthat used in the experimental investigation.\n\nIn order to maximize the\n\nutility of this investigation as regards the design of a hopping vehicle,\nthe periodicity of the acceleration pulses was made to coincide with a\nsimplified dynamic model of a hopping vehicle in a lunar environment.\nThe vehicle was modeled as a point mass launched and landed at 450 with\nrespect to level terrain.\n\nAll losses were neglected so that the model\n\nballistic flight was parabolic in shape and the landing was a mirror\nimage of the takeoff.\nA parabolic shape was used for the landing and takeoff acceleration\npulses.\n\nThree independent variables, acceleration pulse width tpw,\n\nheight gmax\' and the time interval between landing and the subsequent\ntakeoff t\n\nt\n\nrest\'\n\nserve as inputs to the dynamic vehicle model.\n\n11\n\nAll of the\n\nremaining parameters which characterize flight are dependent variables\nand can be calculated from these three inputs.\n\nThe most important\n\ndependent variables from a design standpoint are the stroke required\nfor takeoff dto, the horizontal distance covered in one hop dhop\' the\ntotal time per cycle tcycle, and the average ground speed vav (equals\ndhop/tcycle ).\n\nIn addition, P\n\nwas calculated for each acceleration\n\nprofile by inputting the waveform into the dynamic human model.\nFig. 1 gives parametric design curves for use in hopping vehicle\ndesign.\n\nEven though they are dependent parameters, the average ground\n\nspeed v\n\nand average absorbed power P\nare the most important variables\nav\nav\nso they were used for the major axes. One independent variable trest\nwas held constant at 5 seconds.\n\nComputer runs were made with t\nheld\npw\nconstant and gmax incremented in steps of 1 g. The takeoff stroke dto\n\nis also a very important parameter from a design standpoint so lines\nof constant stroke distance were mapped on the original curves.\nFrom an inspection of the parametric design curves, a number of.\ninteresting observations are immediately apparent.\n\nFor instance,\n\nassume that 8 ft/sec is the minimum average ground speed that would\nprove useful for a lunar hopping vehicle.\n\nThis speed can be accomplished\n\nby using a parabolic pulse with tpw = 0.2 sec and gmax\n\n= 5g.\n\nHowever,\n\nthis results in an average absorbed power of over 30 watts, well above\nthe 10 watt maximum which can be tolerated for any length of time.\n\nThe\n\nsame average ground speed can be effected by using a pulse with\ntp\n\n= 0.5 sec and g\n\n= 2 g.\n\nThis pulse gives an acceleration profile\n\nfor which P\n\nis approximately 2 watts! The penalty for going from\nav\nthe former ride to the latter is an increase in the takeoff stroke dt\nfrom approximately 2 feet to approximately 6 feet.\nThe explanation for marked decreases in P\n\nand hence subjective\nav\ndiscomfort for the same average ground speed with wider pulse widths can\nbe summarized as follows.\n\nPulse widths of approximately 0.2 seconds\n\ngive acceleration profiles with significant components in the region of\n5 Hz, which are particularly intolerable in that they excite the major\nvisceral resonance.\n\nIn general, the wider the pulse width, the lower\n\nthe frequency components of the associated ride, which produces less\nsubjective discomfort for the same average ground speed.\n\n12\n\n35\n\n.30\n30\n\nd\n,o__dto\n\nt)\n\nI\n\n1\n\n/8~~\n\n25\n\n$20\n\n5_10_15320I5\n\nI\n\nI\n\n1\n15r-/\nI\n\n4)0\n\n/\n\n1\n\n/\n\nbo\n\n4\n\n10\n\n.50\n\n.60\n~0\n\nrest~~\'\nAverage Ground Speed (ft/sec)\n\nFigure 1.\n\nParametric Design Curves for Parabolic Acceleration Pulse\ntrest\n5.0 sec\n\n~\n\nConclusions and Recommendations\nFat embolism was found to be the main hazard to animals exposed\nto cyclic acceleration pulses.\n\nHowever, fat embolism is most commonly\n\nclinically associated with injuries resulting from single impacts.\nThis suggests that fat embolism is at least a secondary hazard for a\nwide range of acceleration exposures and this premise should be explored\nwith further animal studies.\n\nIn addition, the findings of the experi-\n\nmental study raise serious questions regarding the common practice in\nstudies of human voluntary tolerance of progressively increasing the\nacceleration loading and/or exposure time to the point where subjects\ncomplain of moderate to severe pain.\nThe analytical study indicated that a human could tolerate the\nride of a hopping vehicle at speeds of at least 8 ft/sec if pulse widths\nof at least 0.4 sec were used.\n\nThese results should be verified by\n\nexperiments involving first monkeys to check for fat embolism and other\nhazards and then continuing with human subjects if warranted.\n\n14\n\nSection 3\n\nATTITUDE CONTROL OF HOPPING VEHICLES\n\nIn this section, the automatic attitude control of hopping vehicles\nis analyzed assuming the use of paired control moment gyros to produce\ntorques on the vehicle.\n\nThe analyses are verified both by computer and\n\nhardware simulations. A more detailed discussion of the subject matter\nof this section is given in [11].\nAfter a hopping vehicle leaves the surface, it must be reoriented\nso that the propulsion leg is at the instant of landing nearly aligned\nwith the mass center velocity vector.\n\nUpon landing, the vehicle is\n\nrotated to the vertical and this orientation is maintained until the\ninitiation of the next hop.\n\nThe rotations at take-off and landing may\n\nbe accomplished by precessing control moment gyros in a paired or twin\nconfiguration (Fig. 2).\n\nIn such a configuration, moments are produced\n\nabout a single body axis much like flywheel attitude control systems.\nMomentum storage devices such as control moment gyros are attractive\nfor use in hopping vehicles because no mass is expelled on each hop as\nwould be the case for rocket reaction systems.\nThe magnitude of angular momentum which must be stored in the twin\ngyro controller is determined in part by the flight time during which\nthe vehicle must be rotated from the launch to landing orientation.\nMinimizing the amount of this stored angular momentum is accomplished\nby allowing gyro gimbal angles to approach 90\xc2\xb0 , at which angle all of\nthe stored angular momentum is transferred to the vehicle.\n\nIf large\n\ngimbal angles are to be achieved, the torque motor which precesses the\ngyros must have a torque capability greater than 0.71934 of 2h 2/I, where\nh is the angular momentum of each gyro rotor and I is the moment of\ninertia of the vehicle about its pitch axis.\n\nThis relationship results\n\nfrom the intimate coupling of the gyro and vehicle equations of motion.\nUnlike flywheel attitude control systems, all of the stored angular\nmomentum in a twin-gyro controller cannot be transferred to the vehicle\nwith an arbitrarily small torque level.\n\n15\n\nCONTROLLER\nFRAME\n\nGYRO WHEEL\n\nTORQUE\nMOTOR\n\nMOMENTUM EXCHANGE AXIS\n\nmm...

Assuming\nisentropic gas expansion and instantaneous leg braking, the first-order\nequations of motion for acceleration, free flight, and deceleration were\nderived.\n\nUsing the free-flight equations, the optimum launch angle which\n\nmaximizes the range is found to be aopt\nsurface slope.\n\n=\n\n450 + a/2, where a is the average\n\nSpecializing to a opt\' for -10\xc2\xb0 < a < 100, approximate\n\nanalytical solutions with a\n\nnumerical error of less than\n\n1%\n\nhave been\n\nfound for the initial and final cylinder pressures po and pf :\n\n23\n\n=\n\nPo\n\n(y-\n\n1)(M + 2m)g\n\n(do)(7\n\n2A-1\n\n_\n\n1)]\n\ntan a\ntan a\n\ndo\n\nopt\n\nX\n\nPf =\n\n( - 1) Mg\nI(df)(Y\n\n1\n1\n\nd\n\ncot a\not\n\npt\n\nwhere XR = horizontal displacement of vehicle, M and m are vehicle and\nleg\n\nmass, y is gas specific heat ratio, g the lunar gravity, and A the\n\npiston area.\n\nThe subscripted d\'s indicate start and stop positions of\n\nthe piston for the expansion and compression strokes.\n\nEquations for\n\nthe amount of gas to be added and vented have also been derived.\nFig. 6 shows the thermodynamic variations in cylinder pressure,\ntemperature, and gas mass for a typical level, uphill, and downhill\nhopping sequence, cyclically repeated.\n\nThe parameters for this sequence\n\nare:\n= df = 1 ft\n\nM = 37 slug\n\nd\n\nm = 3,slug\n\nde = d d = 3 ft\n\nT = 5300 R\n\ny = y(N2 ) = 1.40\n\nXR = 50 ft\n\ng = 5.31 ft/sec2\n\nThe solid lines in Fig. 6 show the "equilibrium" thermodynamic\ncycle (for three hops) approached as the number of hops in the sequence\nbecomes very large.\n\nUsing this sequence, the equilibrium consumption\n\nfor 1000 hops at 50 ft per hop (10 miles) is 0.8 slug of cold N 2 .\n\nTo\n\nthis amount an allowance of 75 to 100% is added to account for nonoptimum launches, rougher terrains, refillings if necessary, ullage,\nand a safety reserve.\n\nThe total N2 required for the 10-mile trip is\n\nestimated to be 1.5 slug.\n\nIf N2H4 were used, 0.3 slug of fuel would\n\nbe needed for the same trip.\n\n24\n\nSecond-Order Model\nTo obtain a more realistic estimate of the vehicle performance,\na second-order model of the propulsion and ballistics was established.\nIt included realistic effects such as sliding, friction at the pivot\nand in the piston, rotation during deceleration, and non-instantaneous\nengagement.\n\nThe effects of the leg brake, ankle brake, propellant-\n\nfeed system, gyro-control system, and foot-control mechanism were\nconsidered and a prediction model for cylinder pressures was used.\nThe resulting nonlinear equations were organized into a computer\nSolutions were obtained for about\n\nprogram for numerical integration.\n\n80 different hop configurations within the following ranges of hop\nparameters:\nAverage surface slope:\n\n-20\n\n< a < 20\xc2\xb0\n\nDesired horizontal range:\n\n30 ft < XR < 60 ft\n\nStatic coefficient of friction:\n\n0.67 <\n\nKinetic coefficient of friction<:\n\n0.33 < "kin < 1.20\n\nstat < 2.00\n\nAnalysis of hopper landings indicated that rather large valves may\nbe needed to vent gas as fast as is necessary.

Establishment of preliminary design criteria, design, fabrication, and testing are summarized.\n\nThe work described in this section is presented in greater\n\ndetail in [131.\n\nThe demonstrator is shown in Fig. 8.\n\nA schematic\n\nof the various systems of the demonstrator is shown in Fig. 9.\nThe propulsion system provides the thrust required for trajectories\nranging up to a 5 ft. vertical hop and a 10 ft. horizontal hop.\nlength horizontal hops are obtained by using a 45\xc2\xb0\n\nMaximum\n\nlaunch angle and\n\nstraight line operating range of the vehicle is extended by repeated\nhorizontal hops.\n\nThrust forces are obtained by using compressed nitrogen\n\nat 600 psia to drive a piston down the 30" long cylinder that is located\nin the center of the structure.\n\nThe piston shaft is attached to a\n\ncleated foot which presses against the ground to propel the vehicle.\nHop trajectories with vertical, 670, and 450 launch angles are achieved\nby reorienting the thrust cylinder. A hop is initiated by manually\noperating a momentary contact switch which activates an electrical circuit.\nAs the switch is pressed the circuit transmits a timed electrical pulse\nto a three way solenoid valve.\n\nThe valve opens a port which allows the\n\nhigh pressure nitrogen into the thrust cylinder.\n\nPressure on the piston\n\nrapidly increases forcing the foot against the ground and accelerating\nthe vehicle up the piston shaft.\nWhen the piston has traveled 1 ft. it passes a set of blowout ports\nwhich dump the pressure into the atmosphere.\n\nThe electrical circuit is\n\npreset to shut off the nitrogen at that time and vent the upper portion\nof the cylinder to atmosphere. Acceleration ceases and the vehicle\nenters flight.\n\nAs the piston passes the blowout ports it contacts a\n\ncompression spring which brings the relative velocity between the thrust\nleg and the vehicle to zero and then expands to thrust the leg back\n\n28\n\nI=:\xc2\xb7L;\n\n.. ! \' !\'; .\nl\nt.\n\nV- .\'i.\n;\'\n\nC,-\n\nFigure 8.\n\n...\n\n~~~~~~\'\n\nTechnology Demonstrator\n\n29\n\nTHRUST_\nCYLINDER\n\n.SHOCK\nABSORBER\nGYRO\n\nFigure 9.\n\nSystems Schematic for Technology Demonstrator\n\n30\n\ntowards the launch configuration.\n\nIt is held at the top of the\n\ncylinder by a weak extension spring so that it will not be bent\nduring landing.\n\nThe pressure available to the thrust cylinder is\n\nregulated from 2000 down to 600 psia which limits maximum acceleration to 15 g\'s to protect the stabilization gyro bearings.\n\nThis\n\nalso provides the constant upstream pressure required for repeatable\nhop trajectories. Variable hop heights are achieved by adjusting an\norifice which controls the gas flow rate into the thrust cylinder and\nby controlling the interval during which gas is admitted.\n\nThe cleated\n\nfoot was designed to prevent slippage under the thrust required for\n10 ft. horizontal hops.\ncomponent sizes.\n\nA mathematical model was used to determine\n\nA vertical test rig was built and used to obtain\n\ncontrol settings for different trajectories.\nThe gyro mounted in the rear triangle of the central structure\nis used to provide the torque required to cause a limited angle of\nprecession about the vertical axis if impulsive torques are applied\nduring launch.\n\nThus the vehicle is stabilized to prevent continuous\n\npitch or roll which could result in\n\ntumbling at touchdown.\n\nA math-\n\nematical model was developed and used to predict the relationship\nbetween thrust offset, gyro angular momentum and the resultant angle\nof precession or tilt.\n\nThe gyro, which was recovered from a Norden\n\nbombsight, can provide stabilizing torques to limit the tilt angle to\n150 if the thrust offset is held to a maximum of .125 in. during a\nmaximum thrust 5 ft. vertical hop.\nAlthough\n\nthe lunar hopper design studied in this research used\n\nthe same leg for both launching and landing, the terrestrial demonstrator used separate shock absorbers for deceleration. This was done\nto simplify vehicle attitude control requirements, Three large symmetrically located pneumatic cylinder shock absorbers and associated\nbottom linkage and radiused feet make up the landing gear.\n\nThe sym-\n\nmetric configuration illustrated can tolerate any angle of rotation\nabout the vertical axis at touchdown.\n\nThe bottom leg of the linkage\n\nis long enough to insure that even if the coefficient of friction\n\n31\n\nreaches unity and the vehicle is tilted 15a at touchdown the landing\nforce vector will compress the fully extended shock absorber.\n\nThe 1 ft.\n\nvertical stroke of the propulsion system is the same as used in the\nlanding gear and results in a 6 in. shock absorber piston stroke.\nThe kinetic energy of the vehicle is dissipated by compressing\natmospheric air inside the shock absorber and accelerating it through\nA mathematical model of that process\n\nan orifice in the cylinder head.\n\nwas developed [13] and used to determine the minimum piston diameter\nand associated orifice size required for the 5 ft. maximum hop height.\nSeveral piston sizes were arbitrarily selected and an optimum orifice\narea for each was obtained by maximizing the energy absorbed or minimizing the velocity at final impact.\n\nAn apparently unique solution\n\nwhich would decelerate the demonstrator to zero velocity at final impact was obtained with a 2.5 in. diameter piston and a .125 in. diameter\norifice.\n\nHowever, that solution produced deceleration forces in excess\n\nof the 15 g\'s that the gyro could tolerate.\n\nTherefore, the piston size\n\nwas increased to 4 in. which resulted in decelerating the demonstrator\nto zero velocity earlier in the stroke and then allowing slow acceleration and final impact at a low velocity.\nEach time vertical drop height is changed, the orifices are readjusted to achieve minimum velocity at final impact.\nsorbers, initially contracted,\n\nmust\n\nThe shock ab-\n\nfully extend during launch to\n\nprovide the required energy absorption capability. Although the inertial\nforces generated during launch were sufficient to overcome the friction\nforces which would prevent shock absorber extension, even a small adverse\npressure differential working on the piston area of over 12 sq.in. could\nseriously hinder the required motion.\n\nTherefore, suction on the piston\n\nhead was immediately relieved by a specially designed large floating\nwafer check valve which was installed in the cylinder head.\n\nShock\n\nabsorber extension took place almost as quickly as ground clearance\noccurred during takeoff.\nThe design of the central structure is controlled by various requirements of the propulsion, stabilization, and landing gear systems.\n\n32\n\nMinimum weight, simplicity of fabrication, and ease of analysis were\naccepted as basic requirements.\n\nThe skewed triangle configuration\n\nprovides an open central area for the required mounting and adjustment\nof the thrust cylinder, symmetric mount points for the landing gear,\nand balanced mounting areas for the stabilization and propulsion system\ncomponents.\n\nThe upper members of the structure were made long enough\n\nto provide rough adjustments in the gas bottle locations for center of\ngravity adjustment during initial assembly.\n\nHeight of the structure\n\nis governed by the space required to mount the gyro in the rear triangle.\nWelding jigs were simplified by making the gyro and air bottle mount\ntriangles vertical.\n\nThrust cylinder reorientation is achieved by\n\ninstalling different sets of upper struts for each of the three hop\ntrajectories.\n\nThe length of the struts can be changed to locate the\n\nthrust foot location and provide for adjustment of the line of thrust\napplication to reduce impulsive moments applied during launch.\nThe asembled vehicle is about 2 ft. high, 4 ft. between landing\ngear feet, and weighs 58 lbs.\nflight.\n\nFig. 10 illustrates the demonstrator in\n\nVertical hops of over 5 ft. and horizontal hops of over 11 ft.\n\nhave been conducted with no stability or structural problems.\n\nRepeated\n\nhorizontal hops can be used to extend the straight line operating range\nto over 150 ft.\n\n33\n\nFigure 10.

When a site is selected its direction and distance\nare automatically recorded and propulsion parameters computed and sent\nup to the hopper by the end of the current hop.\n\nThe ballistic phase is\n\ntypically several seconds long and sufficient for reconnaissance and\nsite selection.\n\nEach hop can span 50 - 100 feet, thus permitting high\n\naverage speeds.\n\nConfiguration Considerations\nThe unmanned terrestrial demonstrator has been built and successfully\nflown to prove stability of attitude control and test performance capabilities.\n\nMuch of the technology developed is directly applicable to unmanned\n\nhopping devices for exploration. Propulsion, stabilization, and vehicle\ndynamics are similar in principle and design for either manned or unmanned\ndevices.\n\nSignificant differences occur in guidance, navigation, and control,\n\nas is the case with lunar rovers.\n36\n\nHowever, elimination of the human factors\n\n-.

Remote Sequencing and Functions\n\n37\n\nrestrictions permits increased hopper performance, because take-off\nand landing accelerations can be higher.\nRover performance is severely limited by the requirement for\ncontinuous surveillance of lurain while traveling from point to point,\nbut remote operators on earth require surveillance from hoppers only\npart of the traveling time.\n\nScientific instrument packages for either\n\nrover or hopper should have about the same weights.\n\nHowever, an un-\n\nmanned hopper needs no wheels or large electric motors and requires\nmuch less electrical power for locomotion.\nabort system is needed for hoppers.\n\nAn attitude control and\n\nThus, both types of vehicles may\n\nhave comparable weights.\nA candidate unmanned hopper is illustrated in Fig. 12.\n\nThis\n\nconcept differs from the terrestrial demonstrator in that it has all\nrequired sub-systems for remote operation and incorporates two thrust\nleg mechanisms.\nEach leg is used for alternate hops, i.e., the leg used for takeoff is also used for landing but is idle during the next hop.\n\nDuring\n\nballistic flight the legs rotate in opposite directions and exchange\npositions so that the idle leg is ready for the next hop as soon as\nlanding is completed.\nleg mechanisms.\n\nPlane changes are accomplished with supporting\n\nThe primary source of electrical power is an array of\n\nsolarcells on the top dome.\n\nA radioisotope supply is used for main-\n\ntaining instrument temperatures during lunar nights.\n\nTwo television\n\ncameras are required for bifocal capability, and others may be desirable\nfor on-site observations.\n\n38\n\n-\n\nGuidance TV (2)\n\nLaser reflector\n3truments\nSupport legs (4)\n\nRadioisotope\n\nFigure 12.
