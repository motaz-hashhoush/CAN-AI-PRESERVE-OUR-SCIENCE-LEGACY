A question for today\xe2\x80\x99s\ndiscussion is:\n\n\xef\x83\xba Does the changing business model call for a change\n\nwith regard to standards?\n\n\xef\x82\xa0 What is the appropriate role for standards in the\nnew model?\n\xef\x82\xa0 How can standards facilitate success in the new\nmodel?\n\xef\x82\xa0 What will be characteristics of success-oriented\nstandards?\n2\n\nThe New National Space Policy\nis Driving Change\n\xe2\x80\xa2 One goal of our new national space policy is to:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Energize competitive domestic industries to participate in\n\nglobal markets and advance the development of: satellite\nmanufacturing; satellite-based services; space launch;\nterrestrial applications; and increased entrepreneurship.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 From the policy comes specific charge to NASA to:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\x9cContract with industry, to provide ISS transport to and\n\nfrom the ISS for NASA astronauts as soon as possible to\nreduce the risk of dependence on foreign transport.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n3\n\nA New Paradigm for Human\nSpaceflight\n\xe2\x80\xa2 In previous human spaceflight programs\n\nNASA:\n\xef\x82\xa0 Had total oversight responsibility\n\xef\x82\xa0 Made all major decisions\n\xef\x82\xa0 Closely oversaw all details of design,\ndevelopment, testing, production, and launch\npreparation\n\xef\x82\xa0 Civil Servants maintained ultimate decision\nauthority in all matters\n4\n\nA New Paradigm (continued)\n\xef\x82\xa7 In the new model, NASA:\n\xef\x82\xa0 Assumes an insight / oversight partnership with its\nindustry providers\n\xef\x82\xa0 Closely follows the design, development, integration,\nand testing of the vehicle\n\xef\x82\xa0 Observes production practices of the provider\n\xef\x82\xa0 Civil Servants become trusted key members of the\noverall commercial crew provider team\n\xef\x82\xa0 Gains significant insight into issues or concerns that\nimpact vehicle\n\n\xef\x82\xa0 Final decisions on high-expense or contentious\nrecommendations made by NASA and the partner.\n\n5\n\nConsistency Across Standards\nWhat is the appropriate role for\nstandards in the new model?\n\n6\n\nThe Purpose of Standards\nUse #1: Ensure attributes of end product\n\xef\x82\xa7 The primary role of standards is to standardize\nthe process, material, application, and testing\nof an \xe2\x80\x9cacquisition product\xe2\x80\x9d to ensure that the\nend product achieves minimum attributes\ndeemed essential to its service.\n\xef\x83\xba Standardization Journal; July, 2005\n\n7\n\nThe Purpose of Standards\nUse #1 (continued)\n\xef\x82\xa7 Standards lead to standardized processes\nand materials through end product\nrequirements and specifications.\nStandard\n\nRequirements\n\nSpecifications\n\nExacting\nspecifications\nlead to\nstandardized\nproducts\n\n8\n\nThe Purpose of Standards\n\xef\x82\xa7 NASA examples:\nNASA-STD-3001, Vol 2\nRate of\nPressure\nChange\n\nCommercial Human System Integration\nRequirements (CHSIR)\n\n[6007] The rate of change of total internal vehicle\npressure shall be limited to between -206842\nPa/min (-30 psi/min) (-1552 mmHg/min) and\n93079 Pa/min (+13.5 psi/min) (698 mmHg/min)\n\n[CH6002] The system shall limit exposure of the crew to the rate of\nchange of total internal pressure to between -207 kPa (-30.0 psi) (-1,550\nmmHg)/min and +93.1 kPa (+13.5 psi) (+698 mmHg)/min during nominal\noperations.\n\n[6013] The system shall maintain the atmospheric\ntemperature within the range of 18 \xc2\xbaC (64.4 \xc2\xbaF)\nto 27 \xc2\xbaC (80.6 \xc2\xbaF) during all nominal operations,\nexcluding suited operations, ascent, entry,\nlanding, and post-landing.\nAtmospher [6017] The system shall allow the crew to control\natmospheric pressure, humidity, temperature,\ne Control\nand ppO2.\n[6024] The system shall continuously monitor\nCombustion\nMonitoring toxic atmospheric components that would result\nfrom pre-combustion and combustion events\nbefore, during, and after the event and alert the\ncrew in sufficient time for them to take\nappropriate action.\n\n[CH6005] The system shall maintain the atmospheric temperature within\nthe range of 18 \xc2\xbaC (64.4 \xc2\xbaF) to 27 \xc2\xbaC (80.6 \xc2\xbaF) during all nominal flight\noperations, excluding suited operations, ascent, entry, landing, and postlanding.\n\nTemperature\nRange\n\n[CH6009] The system shall provide the capability for crew control of\natmospheric parameters and set-points for atmospheric pressure, ppO2,\ntemperature, humidity, and ventilation.\n[CH6029] The system shall provide a real time capability for the\nmeasurement and display to the crew of the atmospheric concentrations\nof toxic combustion products in the following ranges: carbon monoxide\n(CO) from 5 to 500 ppm, hydrogen cyanide (HCN) from 1 to 50 ppm, and\nhydrogen chloride (HCl) from 1 to 50 ppm.\n\n9\n\nThe Purpose of Standards\nUse #2: Ensure Confidence in Design\n\xef\x82\xa7 Over 49 years, that experience is based on only a\nfew hundred launches of just a handful of\ndesigns.\n\xef\x82\xa7 Use of fully-vetted standards to derive design\nrequirements leads to confidence in (and insight\ninto) design\n\xef\x82\xa7 The breadth and depth of the flight test program\nwill depend on a number of factors including\nsystem maturity and depth of insight into design\nand verification. (from the NASA Commercial\nHuman-Rating Plan CCT-1001, May 21, 2010)\n\n10\n\nThe Purpose of Standards\nUse #3: Document Lessons Learned\n\xef\x82\xa7 It is imperative that new engineers have access\nto the wisdom behind the specifications, so\nexplanations like \xe2\x80\x9cthat\xe2\x80\x99s the way it\xe2\x80\x99s always\nbeen done\xe2\x80\x9d are replaced by \xe2\x80\x9cthat specific\nrequirement is in there because\xe2\x80\xa6.\xe2\x80\x9d A\nstandardized process for capturing lessons\nlearned from specifications is needed. July\n2005 Standardization Journal\n11\n\nThe Purpose of Standards\nUse #4: Human Rating of Spacecraft\n\xef\x82\xa7 Standards are an important part of the process for\nhuman rating of a spacecraft\n\xef\x83\xba Human spaceflight is an important aspect of our overall space\n\nprogram, and human rating is an incredibly important part of\nmaking that successful, safe.\n\xef\x83\xba \xe2\x80\x9cBecause it\xe2\x80\x99s illogical to rely on commercial providers to provide\ntheir own requirements for contractual services on human\nspaceflight, the Aerospace Advisory Panel strongly believes that\nspecific criteria should be developed to establish how safe is safe\nenough\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d Robert Dickman, Executive Director AIAA\n\n12\n\nConsistency Across Standards\nHow can standards facilitate\nsuccess in the new model?\n\n13\n\nConsistency Across Standards\n\xef\x82\xa7 All COTS and Commercial Resupply Service programs set\n\nup to supply the ISS launches will be FAA-licensed.\n\xef\x82\xa7 We need consistent, consensus standards to facilitate the\nlicensing process.\n\xef\x82\xa7 \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99d really like to see a dialogue within the aerospace\n\ncommunity, with the goal of coming up with what are really\nindustry consensus standards, even if the first draft is\nprovided by NASA through an RFI, that would lay out some\ntop-level principles and practices we can all agree on that\nwould provide a basic safety foundation.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xef\x83\xba George C. Nield, Associate Administrator for Commercial Space\n\nTransportation, FAA\n\n14\n\nDanger of Over-Prescriptive\nStandards\n\xef\x82\xa7 \xe2\x80\x9cThe danger if we\xe2\x80\x99re too prescriptive on the\nrequirements, we may inadvertently prevent the\ninnovation and creativity needed for safer, more cost\neffective systems.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xef\x83\xba George C. Nield, Associate Administrator for\nCommercial Space Transportation, FAA\n\n15\n\nA Balance Is Needed\n\nPrescriptive\nStandards\n\nConfidence\nand Insight\nin Design\n\nGeneral\nStandards\n\nCreativity\nand\nInnovation\n\n16\n\nConsistency Across Standards\n\xef\x82\xa7 \xe2\x80\x9cWe worked very hard with the Air Force on the\n\nEastern Range to develop common safety\nstandards, so that even if it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t word for\nword, the intent of every requirement for\nlaunching off the Range is equivalent, so there\nwouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be conflicting standards whether it\nwas a launch for the Air Force or a commercial\nvehicle.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xef\x83\xba George C. Nield, Associate Administrator for\n\nCommercial Space Transportation, FAA\n17\n\nEnabling vs Inhibiting\n\xef\x82\xa7 \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s important that we build standards that\n\nwill enable companies to build alternatives to\nSoyuz and not set up roadblocks that\nguarantee that we\xe2\x80\x99ll be flying on Soyuz\nforever.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xef\x82\xa0 Ken Bowersox, vice president of astronaut safety\nand mission assurance development, Space\nExploration Technologies\n\n18\n\nConsistency Across Standards\nWhat will be characteristics of\nsuccess-oriented standards?\n\n19\n\nCharacteristics of SuccessOriented Standards\n\xef\x82\xa7 The FAA will soon be licensing commercial\n\nproviders to carry astronauts into space and\nto ISS.\n\xef\x82\xa7 To facilitate certification and licensing, we\ncan identify some characteristics of successoriented standards.\n\n20\n\nSuccess-Oriented Standards\nStandards should:\n1. Be evidence-based\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Clear linkage to references (peer-reviewed\n\nliterature)\n\n2. Include a rationale\nExplains basis of the standard and captures\nlessons learned\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nFor example, is the air quality standard based upon\nconcerns about crew health or the health of the air\nrevitalization system?\n21\n\nSuccess-Oriented Standards\nStandards should: (continued)\n3.

Enable progress (continued)\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nExample of a process-based standard: ISO\n21348:2007(E) Space environment (natural and\nartificial) \xe2\x80\x94 Process for determining solar irradiances\n\xef\x82\xad 4.3 Process-based standard: This International Standard\ndoes not specify one measurement set, one reference\nspectrum, one solar model or one solar irradiance proxy/index\nas a single standard. In order to encourage continual\nimprovements in solar irradiance products, this International\nStandard is a process-based standard for determining solar\nirradiances. A solar irradiance product, after its development,\nmay follow the process described in Clause 7 to certify\ncompliance with this International Standard.\n\n23\n\nConclusions\n\xef\x82\xa7 Standards serve many the same functions in\n\nthe new human spaceflight business model:\n\xef\x83\xba Standardize key aspects of end products\n\xef\x82\xa0 Drive requirements and specifications\n\xef\x83\xba Lead to confidence in design\n\xef\x83\xba Document Lessons Learned\n\xef\x83\xba Human Rating of Spacecraft\n\n\xef\x82\xa7 Consistency across standards can help assure\n\nsuccess in the new model\n\xef\x83\xba In the writing of a standard, a proper balance must\n\nbe struck between prescriptive specificity and\nenabling generality\n\n24\n\nConclusions\n\xef\x82\xa7 To facilitate success, future standards should:\n\xef\x83\xba Be evidence based\n\xef\x83\xba Include rationale\n\xef\x83\xba Enable progress\n\n25\n\nBackup Information\n\n26\n\nNASA Procedural Requirements 8705.2B\nIdentifies Human Rating Standards &\nRequirements\nNASA SMA\nDirectives and Standards\nNPR 8705.2B\n\nProgram Requirements\nBased on NASA\nDirectives and Standards\n\nNASA Engineering\nDirectives and Standards\n\nNASA Health and Medical\nDirectives and Standards\n\n27\n\nDraft Health & Medical\nStandards for Human Rating\nMandatory Standards for Health and Medical\nNASA-Standard-3001 Volumes 1 and 2\nFAA Human Factors Design Standard\n(applicable for ground processing)\nMIL-STD-1472 Human Engineering,\nDesign Criteria for Military Systems,\nEquipment, and Facilities (applicable for\nground processing)\nNASA-STD-3000 Volumes I-II, Man\nSystems Integration Standard\n\n28\n\nWhat\xe2\x80\x99s Been Done\n\xe2\x80\xa2 In May, 2010, NASA sent out Commercial Crew\n\nTransportation (CCT) Request For Information (RFI)\n(NNH10ZTT005L)\n\n\xef\x82\xa7 The RFI lists mandatory requirements for human rating\n\nand requests industry input.\n\n\xef\x82\xad Discuss any aspects of the NASA documents contained in this\nRFI that result in significant cost, schedule, or technical impacts\nto your company\xe2\x80\x99s CCT system.\n\xef\x82\xad What clarifications or suggestions do you propose to minimize\nimpacts or improve design flexibility, safety, or reliability?\n\xef\x82\xad Provide rationale for any alternative suggestions that may meet\nor exceed the intent of these requirements and standards\n\n29\n\nGovernment Oversight Models\n\n30\n\nExamples of Consistency:\nAnthropometry\n1st and 99th Percentiles\n\nMeasure (in)\n\nHFES\n\nHDIH\n\nMax Delta\n\nStature\n\n58.4/75.2\n\n58.5/76.6\n\n1.4 (2%)\n\nSitting Height\n\n30.5/39.0\n\n30.6/39.9\n\n0.9 (2%)\n\nEye Height, sitting\n\n26.1/34.2\n\n26.2/35.0\n\n0.8 (2%)\n\nKnee Height,\nsitting\n\n17.9/24.5\n\n17.9/25.0\n\n0.5 (2%)\n\n5th and 95th Percentiles\nMeasure (in)\n\nHFES\n\nMil Std\n1472\n\nMax Delta\n\nStature\n\n60.2/73.5\n\n60.0/73.1\n\n0.4 (1%)\n\nSitting Height\n\n31.3/38.3\n\n31.0/38.1\n\n0.3 (1%)\n\nEye Height, sitting\n\n27.0/33.4\n\n26.7/33.3\n\n0.3 (1%)\n\nKnee Height,\nsitting\n\n18.7/23.9\n\n18.5/23.7\n\n0.2 (1%)\n31\n\nExample of Inconsistency:\nAir Quality\nCompound\n\nGOST *(ppm)\n\nNRC** (ppm)\n\nEthanol\n\n10 (360 days)\n\n1000 (180 and 1000 days)\n\nBenzene\n\n0.2 (180 days)\n\n0.07 (180 days)\n\nButanol\n\n0.8 (360 days)\n\n12 (180 and 1000 days)\n\nToluene\n\n8.0 (360 days)\n\n4.0 (180 and 1000 days)\n\n* STATE STANDARD OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION - COSMONAUT\xe2\x80\x99S\nHABITABLE ENVIRONMENTS ON BOARD OF MANNED SPACECRAFT,\nGOST 50804\n** National Research Council, Spacecraft Maximum Allowable Concentrations\n(multiple volumes)\n\n32\n\nAppendix A\nList of Government Human Factors\nStandards\n\n\xef\x82\xa7 NASA-STD-3001, NASA SPACE FLIGHT HUMAN-SYSTEM\n\n\xef\x82\xa7\n\xef\x82\xa7\n\xef\x82\xa7\n\n\xef\x82\xa7\n\nSTANDARD VOL 2: HUMAN FACTORS, HABITABILITY, AND\nENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH; 2009\nCxP 70024, CONSTELLATION PROGRAM HUMAN-SYSTEMS\nINTEGRATION REQUIREMENTS, Rev D; 2009\nMIL-STD-1472D, HUMAN ENGINEERING DESIGN CR ITERiA\nFOR SYSTEMS, EQUIPMENT AND FACILITIES; 1989\nDOT/FAA/CT-03/05, HF-STD-001, HUMAN FACTORS DESIGN\nSTANDARD (HFDS) For Acquisition of Commercial Off-TheShelf Subsystems, Non-Developmental Items, and\nDevelopmental Systems; 2003\nNASA/SP-2010-3407, HUMAN INTEGRATION DESIGN\nHANDBOOK (HIDH), 2010\n33\n\nAppendix B\nNon-Goevernmental Human Factors\nStandards\n\xef\x82\xa7 IEEE Std 1023-1988, Guide for the Application\nof Human Factors Engineering to Systems,\nEquipment and Facilities of Nuclear Power\nGenerating Stations\n\n34\n\n'
