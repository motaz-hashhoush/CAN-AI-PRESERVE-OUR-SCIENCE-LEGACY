It is a part of an integrated plan, prepared by NASA in part in response to the Augustine Committee recommendations, to describe and advocate expanded and more aggressive efforts in the development of advanced space technologies. This expanded program will provide a technology basis for future space missions to which the U.S. aspires, and will help to regain technology leadership for the U.S. on a broader front. The six aspects of this integrated program/plan deal with focused technologies to support space sciences, exploration, transportation, platforms, and operations as well as provide a Research and Technology Base Program. This volume describes the technologies needed to support transportation systems, e.g., technologies needed for upgrades to current transportation systems and to provide reliable and efficient transportation for future space missions. The Office of Aeronautics, Exploration, and Technology (OAET) solicited technology needs from the major agency technology users and the aerospace industry community and formed a transportation technology team (appendix A) to develop a technology program to respond to those needs related to transportation technologies. This report addresses the results of that team activity. It is a strategic plan intended for use as a planning document rather than as a project management tool. It is anticipated that this document will be primarily utilized by research & technology (R&T) management at the various NASA Centers as well as by officials at NASA Headquarters and by industry in planning their corporate Independent Research and Development (IR&D) investments.", "title": "Transportation technology program: Strategic plan", "stiType": "TECHNICAL_MEMORANDUM", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T18:00:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Technical Memorandum (TM)", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19930013843, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19930013843, "id": "1c93e66b2cd24372991d5baae0d13162", "publicationDate": "1991-09-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19930013843.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19930013843/downloads/19930013843.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19930013843/downloads/19930013843.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19930013843/downloads/19930013843.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
