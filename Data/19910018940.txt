Level of complexity and development costs soar as operations are made completely automated.\nA degree of manual intervention tends to keep cost down by allowing human decision making to determine what to do\nnext, and then have the robot do a limited set of tasks. This is normally referred to as supervisory control.\nFor STV processing support from the space station, we must also consider the availability of personnel at the station for\nSTV related activities. By utilizing an IVA astronaut, supervisory control, and an RMS robotic arm, we would minimize\nthe demands made on the astronaut and the time necessary for turn-around of an STV mission.\n\nDegree of Automation\n\nSollwara\nDevel\xc2\xb0pment\nCost\n\nIS\n\nCost\n\nDue to Crew Umitstione\n\n$\nBiased\n\nToward Automation\n\n"\n\nOperational\nCost\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\ni\n\nAutonomous\nRobolics\n\nSupervlsory\nControl\n\nTeleOperation\n\nManned\nAugmentation\n\nManuel\nHands-On\n\nDegree\n\nof Automation\n\n1078\n\nEVA\n\nvs IVA Preliminary\n\nRankina\n\nWe conducted an in-depth trade study to assess the level of automation that should be incorporated in space-based\nSTV support operations. This assessment included evaluation of the parameters listed below. Consideration was\ngiven to performing specific operations with EVA, remote operations with an IVA crew member providing control, and\nfully automated robotic operation. We found that remote operations were preferable to fully automated operations in\nmost cases, although the precise level of automation depends on the specific task.

Pre-flight assembly and final verification along with flight recenification and recertification is accomplished at LEO.\nThe Transfer Vehicle with a 45\' dia. Aerobrake has 4 RL-10 engines with a propellant capacity of 5.7 t in the STV core\ntanks, 107.2 t in the TLI Drop Tanks, and 41.8 t in the LOI Orop Tanks. The Landing Vehicle has 4 ASE (Advanced\nSpace Engines) with a propellant capacity of 22.3 t.\nThe picture on the left depicts the LTV with cargo pedorming the main engine burn to start the journey to the\nmoon. The picture on the right shows the LTV and LEV in lunar orbit. This picture was taken after the crew and\ncargo transfer and the two vehicles have separated.

A Level II directive (BB000610A) has\nbeen recently issued, changing the previous requirement of 10 I_g in the laboratory modules.\nThis directive\nstates that the Station "shall be capable of providing quasi-steady acceleration levels not to exceed 1 gg for at\nleast 50% of the user accommodation locations in each of the pressurized laboratories (US Lab, ESA and JEM\nPM at AC)\'.

The two dimensional constraints are in the Y (or latitudinal) dimension and the Z (or radial)\ndimension of the Station configuration. The STV enclosure is assumed to be placed in a location bounded by a "lower\nkeel\', or two downward pointing extensions of the truss structure connected by a cross boom. The boom dimensions\nare governed by the physical space available on the main truss structure as well as constraints in station controllability\nwhich govern the extent to which the truss can grow downward.\nAs depicted on the figure, the maximum dimension the inclosure can grow along the Y axis is 35 meters. Thus the\nmaximum STV diameter within the enclosure will be 31-33 meters, depending on safety factors. In the Z dimension,\nthe limit, as shown, has two components.\nForward of the lower keel truss structure plane, the maximum enclosure\ngrowth limit is 26.6 meters. This is due to clearance requirements for STS docking to the Space Station. Aft of the\ntruss structure plane, the limit is relaxed to 43.8 m, which is bounded by the envelope for a pressurized logistics\nmodule attached to a min-node.\n\nSTV Size Sensitivity-\n\nSTV size can grow to\'within\n--\n\nSpace Station\n\nFreedom\n\nEnclosure\n\nLimits\n\n4m of enclosure\n\n1093\n\ngrowth limits\n\nSTV Mass Sensitivity\n\nFor\n\nthis\n\nanalysis,\n\npositioned\nstudy\n\non Human\n\nSpace\n\nStation\n\ntorques\npitch\nwill\n\nit was\n\non a lower\n\nFreedom\nCurrent\n\nand\n\nwill\n\nsignificantly\n\nfurther\npotential\n\nnot\n\nimprove\n\nreduced\nSTV\n\nassumed\n\nkeel\n\ntoward\nmass\n\nthat\n\nof the\n\nExploration,\n\ncancel.\nangle\n\n- GN&C\n\nflies\n\na high-mass\n\nSpace\n\nStation.\n\nwhich\n\nrecommended\n\nat Torque\n\nanalysis\n\nthat\n\nthe\n\nrequirement\n\nthe\n\npitch\n\nattitude.\n\nRoll\n\nTEA\n\nto be supported,\n\nTEA\n\nto fly\n\nSTV Mass Sensitivity\n\nmass\n\n(TEA),\n\n+/-\n\nwill\n\nSTV\n\nm\n\nservicing\n\nNovember\n\n1989\n\nkeel\n\nto support\n\nlunar\n\naerodynamic\n\nThe\n\nis increased,\n\nthe\n\npitch\n\nSTV\n\nmass,\n\n+/- 5 degree\n\nenclosure\nNASA\n\ngravity\nhas\n\nbut\n\ngradient\n\na large\n\naddition\nand\n\nnegative\n\nof a lower\n\nyaw\nover\n\nattitudes\nthe\n\nkeel\nare\n\nrange\n\nof\n\nrequirement.\n\nImpacts\n\nI\n\nI\nU\xc2\xb0\n\nI\n\ni\n\n40000\n\nI\n\n80000\n\nP\n\nI\n\n120000\n\np\n\nI\n\nI_,0000\n\n200_00\n\nSl"V\n\nRoll\nPitch\nYaw\n\n- t So in pitch is SSF req\'l (Source: SSFP Documenl\n- Low mass STV mounted on horizontal keel\nAssumptions:\n- Higher\n\nmass STV\n\nmounted\n\non lower keel\n\n- C.G. of high mass STV located\nI\n\nIncreased\n\n90-day\n\noperations.\n\n- G,N&C\n\nSSF Attitude\n\nTorque Equilibrium\nAttitude (TEA),\nDegrees\n\nand\nStation\n\nof LVLH.\n\nadditional\n\nwithin\n\nx15.3\n\nthe\n\nComplete\n\n5 degrees\n\nwith\n\nremain\n\nwhere\n\nAssembly\n\nof the\n\nincreases\n\nTEA\n\nin a 15.3\nis from\n\nof a lower\n\nof the\n\nwithin\n\nthe\n\nattitude\n\nStation\n\naddition\n\nAttitude\n\nthe\n\nAs\n\nis supported\n\nconfiguration\n\nthe\n\nEquilibrium\n\nindicates\n\nmeet\n\nLVLH.\n\nSTV\nThis\n\nSTV Mass "Helps"\n\nal X=0,\n\nMaintain\n\nY-0,\n\ni\n\nZ--50m\n\nSSF Pitch Attitude\n\nSpace Station Freedom\nMcDonnell Douglas Space Systems Company\n\n1094\n\n30426)\n\nMau\n\n(kO)\n\nAttitude\nAttitude\nAttitude\n\no\ni\nn\n\nSTV Mass Sensitivity\n\n- GN&C\n\nBaseline momentum storagecapacity for Space Station Freedom is provided by a pallet containing6 Control\nMoment Gyros (CMGs).

As can be seen on the left\nhand chart, even when the enclosure reaches its maximum size of 35x35 m, less than one additional propellantmodule\nwould be needed in a high solar cycle yea. This is when reboostrequirements are at a maximum clue to atmospheric\nexpansion.\nAs the enclosure size grows, added drag and mass cause the Station center of gravity (and microgravity ellipses) to\nmove lower relative to the experiment module section. This movement, less than three meters from minimum to\nmaximum enclosure size, can be considered of a minimumimpact.\n\nSTV Size Sensitivity-\n\nReboost and Microgravity\nStation\n--\n\n30\n\n--\n\n--\n\n35\n30\n25\n\n20\n\nSSF c.g.\n(meters below\ncenter of\nmare truss)\n125\n12\n\n./\n./\n./\n\n11.5\n_t0\n\n=5\n\n/\n\nII\n\n/\n105\n\nLOW Solar\nCycle\n(2007)\n\nHigh Solar\nCycle\n(201 I)\n\n]\n\nI [, ._ _ 15 ] PI [/*clo_,Jf\n\n,/\n\nI0\n\nNO Erb\xc2\xa2 Iosure\n\n]\n\nLocation\n\n40\n\n--\n\nCenter of Gravity\n(Along Z Axis)\n\nQ\n\n]Sx\n\n]5\n\nI\n\n95\n\n=:\n\nI\n\n_V\n\nM Enclosure\n\nI\n\nLJ\n\nI\n\nOv\n\nEnclosure Dimensions (m)\n\nMinimal\nSpace\n\nSSF impacts\nStation\n\nFreedom\n\nwith\n\ngrowth\n\nin STV and enclosure\n\nMcDonnell Douglas Space Systems Company\n\n1097\n\nsize\n\nI\n\nvJ\n\nI\nAr_\n1v\n\nSTV\n\nSize\n\nSensitivity\n\nAnalysis\n\n- Issues\n\nThe primary S\'IV size growth issues which still require analysis include trading off between allowing the Z dimension\ngrowth to its maximum while moving the C.G. of the STV system back along the Station\'s X axis. This cantilever effect\nhas implications to Station flight dynamics and control which cannot be predicted at this time.\nA second issue involves the impacts of STS approach operations on S\'IV size growth. There will be an uncertainty in\nSTS position as it moves along its approach path which may lower the Z dimension growth limit below 26.6 meters.\nAdditionally, there is a safety requirement for STS rendezvous which requires that all potential impact points be visible\nto the STS crew. Any size S\'IV enclosure will violate this requirement, so operational procedures will have to be\naddressed. The STS RCS firing sequence for Space Station approach is being planned to avoid RCS plume\nimpingement upon Station pressurized elements, radiators and photovoltaic arrays. This sequence may have\nunforeseen effects due to plume impingement, and resulting overpressure, on the STV enclosure walls. This will\nundoubtedly be dependent on STV enclosure size. Finally, contingency departure paths for a shuttle whose Station\ndocking maneuver has been aborted have not been determined, but will be restricted by enclosure size growth.\nTwo final issues involve Space Station payload operations. Downward viewing payloads on the horizontal truss will\nhave their field of view blocked by the presence of the enclosure. Relocating them to the truss structure below the STV\nenclosure is one solution, but many operational issues still remain. A payload element to be supplied by the European\nSpace Station partners is a man-tended free flyer which will be serviced at the Station on a regular basis to be\ndetermined.\nIts approach path, and its docking point have yet to be determined, but lower node locations are the\npreferred option for this operation, and this may impact Z dimension growth limits.\n\nSTV Size Sensitivity\n\nAnalysis-\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 X vs. Z Growth Tradeoff\n\nand Mass Cantilever\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Space Shuttle Approach\n\n- STS Abort Waveoff\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Man Tended\n\nGrowth\n\nLimit\n\nViewing Angle Requirement\n\n- Plume Impingement\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Downward\n\nEffects\n\nPaths\n\n- Impact on Z Dimension\n- STS Docking\n\nIssues\n\nLooking\n\nand Overpressure\nPaths\n\nPayload Viewing\n\nFree Flyer (MTFF)\n\nInterference\n\nSpace Station Freedom\nMcDonnell\n\nDouglas\n\nSpace\n\n1098\n\nSyslems\n\nCompany\n\non Enclosure\n\nSTV Assembly\n\nSensitivity\n\nAnalysis\n\n- Issues\n\nAlthough a number of SSF mechanical systems can be adapted for use in the STV program, there are still\nseveral mechanical systems required for the LEO servicing facility that will be unique to the STV program.\nThese include an STV core stage handling fixture, engine removal suppo, hardware, STV stack deployment\ndevice, and enclosure opening and closing mechanism. These devices will have to be defined more cieady so\nthat their functions and operational complexity may be better determined.\nWith regards to current SSF mechanical devices that can be adapted to the STV program such as the space\nstation remote manipulator system (SSRMS), the STS docking adapter, and the SSF capture latches, more\nanalysis will have to be pedormed to determine the degree to which these satisfy the STV mission without\nmodification, and what modifications would have to be made to completely satisfy STV operations.\nFor the SSRMS there is the issue of whether a dedicated unit is required for STV assembly and operations, or\nwhether the SSF baselined unit can satisfy both STV assembly and SSF housekeeping and payload\nrequirements and timelines. Also there is the potential impact of dynamic loads on the SSRMS due to propellant\nsloshing in the propellant tanks and how the SSRMS will translate into and out of the LEO servicing facility\nenclosure.\nOther potential STV impacts on current SSF mechanical devices include if the STS docking adapter needs to be\nupgraded for STV operations. Coincidentally, if the STV wants to take advantage of a STS docking adapter, this\nfeature would have to be built into the S.TV design. Finally, if SSF capture latches are to be used, the ETO\ntrunnions would have to be compatible.\n\nSTV Assembly Sensitivity Analysis -Issues\nNew STV Dedicated\n\nMechanical\n\n- Core Stage Handling\n- Engine Removal\n\nFixture\n\nSupport\n\n- STV Stack Deployment\n- Enclosure\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Space\n\nStation\n\nOpening\n\nDevices\n\nHardware\n\nDevice\n\nand Closing Mechanisms\n\nRemote Manipulator\n\n- Need for Dedicated\n\nUnit\n\n- Impact\n\nPropellant\n\nSystem (SSRMS)\n\nof Dynamic\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Use of Upgraded\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Compatibility\n\nSpace\n\nStation\n\nUnpressurized\n\nof STV Component\n\nFreedom\n\nMcDonnell\n\nDouglas\n\nLoads\n\nSTS Docking Adapter for STV\n\nETO Trunnions\n\nSpace\n\nSystems\n\n1099\n\nCompany\n\nWith SSF Latches\n\nSTV Sensitivity_ Analyses\n\n- Conclusion_\n\nThe requiremeni to support STV assembly and servicing operations at Space Station Freedom causes many impacts\nto Space Station Freedom Systems. In addition to augmentation of the Integrated Truss Structure and its Utility\nDistribution System, an enclosure with STV servicing equipment will be provided. Additional power must be supplied\nto perform these servicing operations, and to operate STV systems dudng checkout. Additional thermal control will\nhave to be provided for this extra power, and as is seen earlier, the provision for this growth still has to be\nincorporated into the Space Station design. The majority of servicing operations, such as aerobrake assembly, STV\ncomponent connection and propellant tank handling will be growth impacts on the Assembly Complete Space\nStation.\nHowever, once the impacts are incorporated into the Station, the growth systems show little sensitivity to variations in\nthe STV systems. Station flight control attitude remains within baseline requirements. The original Station\nmicrogravity requirement of 10 gg is satisfied for all foreseen STV masses, while the new 1 gg requirement is never\nsatisfied with a lower keel enclosure. Thus there is no benefit of SI\'V mass targets. Size growth can be\naccommodated for all projected STV configurations, and altitude reboost logistics has only minor changes with STV\nsize growth. The current array of Station mechanical devices will be usable for STV components, especially the\nMobile Servicing Center, which is the key to Space Station operational flexibility. Finally, additional power must be\nprovided to service the STV, but all foreseen power levels can be incorporated by adding photovoltaJc or solar\ndynamic arrays.\n\nSTV Sensitivity Analyses-\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Major Space Station Freedom\n\nConclusions\n\nImpacts to Accomodate\n\n- Added Truss Structure\n- Add Enclosure\n- Additional\n- Servicing\n\nPower and Thermal\n\nControl\n\nOperations\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Space Station Systems Not Sensitive\n- Station Control and Microgravity\n\nto STV Variations\nEnvironment\n\n- STV Size Accomodations\n- Assembly\n\nand Servicing\n\n- Power and Thermal\n\nSpace Station\n\nOperations\n\nControl Systems\n\nFreedom\nMcDonnell\n\nDouglas\n\nSpace\n\n1100\n\nSyslems\n\nCompany\n\nSTV\n\nOn-Orbit\n\nOperations\n\nDuring LTS Mission*\n\nI\n\nI\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 LTS Component\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Storage\n\nUnloading\n\n& Inspection\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Undock\n\nof LTS Components\n\n& Conduct Lunar Mission\n\nOperational\n\xe2\x80\xa2 LTS Assembly\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Pre-Flight\n\nI/F With Surface\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 LEV Rendezvous\n\nCheckout\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Flight Certification\n\n& Dock With LTV\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Perform Cargo Transfer,\nInspection\n\n(Includes\n\nSystems)\n\nLEV to LTV\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Perform LTV Checkout\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Crew Transfer\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Undock and Perform TEl Burn\n\xe2\x80\xa2 OMV Mate/TransporUUnmate\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Launch From LEO\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Verify Clean Tank Separation\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Rectify In-Flight Malfunction\n(Could Occur Anytime During Mission)\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Verify Engine Retraction\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Verify Aerobrake\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Verify Clean Tank Separation\n\xe2\x80\xa2 LTV Rendezvous\n\n(Conduct Aerobrake\n\n& Dock With LEV\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Perform Fluids Transfer,\n\nLTV to LEV\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Perform\n\nManeuver\n\nto LEO)\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 OMV Mate/rransport/Unmate\n\nLTV to LEV\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Perform Cargo Transfer,\n\nDoor Closure\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Post-Flight\n\nInspection\n\n& Checkout\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Maintenance\n\nLEV Checkout\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Vehicle\n\n"Operations\nOperations\n\nListed Represent\nPotential EVAs.\nShown In Bold Type Occur in LEO.\n\n1101\n\nStorage\n\nl, ;/-- iF:#/!.-_|_\n\nr= _.-41 :_,, i.. m\n\nEarly\n\nSDace\n\nStation\n\nSUPport\n\nto STV\n\nDuring the early stages of the STV program, the space station facilities and personnel could be used effectively to prove\nout, demonstrate, and develop concepts to be utilized on the STV in the near future.
