funded the development and/or evaluation of several families of flame\nresistant, nonmetallic materials. One such class of aerospace material was\nthe rigid structural laminate fabricated from fiberlgass and a variety of hightemperature resins: polyimide, polyquinoxaline, polybenzimidazole, chem ceram,\nepoxies, etc. As these materials were being evaluated, parameters such as\ncost, flame resistance, high-temperature resistance, impact strength, tensile\nand flexural modulus, toxicity, durability, and availability were investigated.\nWhile the accumulated data were being reviewed, it became evident that the\npolyimide resin/glass fabric system had the best combination of mechanical\nand physical properties to meet stringent spacecraft requirements. Polyimide/\nglass (PI/GL) materials were subsequently qualified by NASA for unlimited\nuse in the Apollo Spacecraft Program.\nThe unique properties of PI/GL were recognized by NASA as having considerable spin-off capability for commercial applications. Toward this end,\nNASA cooperated with several industries, among them the aircraft, fire\nfighting, and construction industries, to determine the potential usefulness\nof the aerospace materials for nonaerospace applications. The kinds of\ncommercial items NASA was asked to supply for evaluation were diverse. A small\ngroup of these items was selected for development in this demonstration\nprogram.\nRockwell was selected to fabricate these demonstration items because of\nits experience in successfully working with polyimide/glass on the Apollo\ncontract,and the availability of high-temperature autoclaves and other equipment not normally available at companies that work only with low-temperature\nepoxy and polyester resin systems.\nSpecifically, Rockwell performed work in the following activities:\n1. Recommended and provided specific resin/fabric systems which\nconstituted a satisfactory substitute for materials presently\nin use.\n2. Developed and applied the special fabrication techniques required to\nincorporate the resin/fabric systems into the specific applications\ndescribed in the applicable task orders (1 through 15).\n3. Performed development and laboratory tests as necessary in support\nof the tasks of the program.\n\nSD 75-SH-0068\nSD 75-SH-0068\n\nRockwell International\n\nTECHNICAL DISCUSSION.\nBACKGROUND AND DEVELOPMENT HISTORY OF -POLYIMIDES\nPolyimide development and chemistry was pioneered by the E.I. DuPont\nstable\nCompany in the early 1950\'s to meet the demands for more thermally\nbetween\npolymers. The basic polyimide chemistry centers on the reaction\naromatic dianhydrides and dianines. The intermediate product, a polyanic-acid,\nis readily converted by heat or chemical methods to the final polyimide\nstructure:\n\n0\n\nC\n\n0\n\nII\n\nC\nR\n\nN\n\nNC\n\nN-C\n\nC\nII\n\n-H2 0\n\nR\n\n0 +H2 N-R-NH 2\n\nR\n\n0\n\nA\n\nC- NH-R\'\n\nHO-C\n\n0\n\nC\n\nII\n\n0\nII\n\n-\n\nO-OH -\n\n0\n\nIIII\n\nC\n\n-\n\n0\n\nII\n\nII\n\n0\n\nC\n\nC\n\nH\n\n"\n\nII\n\n"\n\nu\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\nX\n\nX\n\nFrom this work evolved a series of products now commercially available.\nThese include Kapton polyimide films, Vespel molded polyimide plastics, Pyre-ML\npolyimide wire enamels and varnishes, and Pyralin polyimide prepregs and precursor solutions. Most of these products found application in the aerospace\nindustry as part of electrical or thermal insulation systems. The polyimides\nin the form of prepregs for the laminating industry, however, found only\nlimited use because of the high-processing temperatures (450-650*F) and pressures 70-500 lb/in. 2 required to produce structural laminates. These process\nparameters required presses and autoclaves not normally available at companies\nthat worked only with polyesters, epoxies, or similar low-temperature resins.\nAdditionally the polymide prepregs lack good tack, were hydroscopic, and\nrequired a long learning cycle before low-void, precipitation-free laminates\ncould be consistently produced.\nIn 1967, the Space Division of Rockwell, in association with NASA,\nconducted an extensive program for the development of a polyimide (PI)/glass\nfabric laminate capable of meeting the nonflammability requirements of the\n2\nApollo spacecraft when tested in a 100-percent oxygen atmosphere at 16.5 lb/in.\npressures as specified in MSC-PA-D-67-13. After numerous flammability tests,\nit was concluded that PI 2501/glass prepreg produced by DuPont could be made\nnonflammable by controlling laminate resin content and using special processing\ntechniques. Figure 1 dramatically shows the performance of specially processed PI/glass and a silicone material it replaced.\n\nPreceding page blank\n- 3SD 75-SH-0068\n\n(NICHROME/RTV\n\nSILICONE ISNITOR-BOTTOM IGNITION\n\nP1. 2501\nPOLYIMIDE LAMINATe\n(21/\'X5"XO.034" 0.036 )\n\n)\n\nDC 7141\nSILICONE LAMINATE\n(2 1/2"X5"XO.039"/0.041")\n\nFigure 1. Comparison of Flammability Characteristics of Four-Ply Polyimide and\nSilicone Glass Laminate in 100-Percent Oxygen Atmosphere at 16.5 lb/in. 2\n\n:\n\nRockwell International\n\nPROPERTIES OF POLYIMIDE/GLASS LAMINATE\n\nOne of the most notable properties of fully cured polyimides is their\nresistance to burning and their low smoke generation when subjected to burning\nconditions. It is the only commercially available organic polymer that is\nself-extinguishing and will not smoke in 100-percent-oxygen atmospheres.\nTable 1 summarizes the flammability properties of the polyimide laminate\ncompared with the epoxy, phenolic, and silicone laminates. The data presented\nin this table show that the epoxy, phenolic, and silicone laminates will burn\nin 100-percent-oxygen atmospheres when subjected to the nichrome ignitor,\nwhereas the polyimide laminate is self-extinguishing.\nNumerous additional flammability tests were conducted on polyimide\nlaminates to study the effect of different cured resin contents and ply construction (laminate thickness). From the data presented in Table 1, it can\nbe seen that control of cured resin content and laminate thickness is critical.\nIn Figure 2; the average combustion rate is plotted against the reciprocal of\nlaminate thickness and number of glass fabric plies. The curve shows that\nlaminates of two to eight plies with a cured resin content of less than\n20 percent are self-extinguishing. Similarly, other curves, shown as broken\nlines, are drawn showing the effects of thickness and resin content on flammability. The generation of such curves permitted a more analytical approach\nto the design of nonflammable structural laminates. The procedure would\nconsist of designing the component based on structural considerations, thereby\nestablishing the necessary laminate thickness.\nOffgassing characteristics of glass-reinforced plastic laminates relative\nto odor, carbon monoxide, and total organics are determined in accordance with\nNASA document MSC-PA-D-67-13 (Test No.\'s 6 and 7), except for exposure duration. The Rockwell test time was 336 hours, whereas the NASA document calls\nfor a period of 72 hours at a temperature of 155 \xc2\xb1 5\xc2\xb0F. No problem was\nencountered, as Table 2 test data show, regardless of resin content, in meeting\nthe toxicity requirements relative to odor, carbon monoxide, and total organics.\nAll work on the development of nonflammable structural glass laminates\nbeen accomplished with DuPont 2501 polyimide resin and 181 style E-glass\nhas\nfabric reinforcement with A1100 finish. These applications include food containers, protective back covers for main display and control panels, many\nother brackets, small covers for electrical switches, etc. Table 3 summarizes\nvarious sources on material properties for polyimide laminates having a resin\ncontent approximately that desired for nonflammable characteristics. The\ndata presented in Column 4 of this table show that the flexural properties of\nlow-resin-content (less than 20 percent by weight), nonflammable polyimide\nlaminates fabricated by Rockwell have strengths within the range of that\nreported for higher resin content laminates.

The high\nboiling point of NMP (395*F), combined with the condensation (H 0) byproduct\n2\nof the polyimide resin during polymerization, characterizes this system as\none requiring close process control. In addition, the polyimide resin, in the\nB-stage condition, is hygroscopic and requires stringent control during\nstorage and processing. Therefore, it is apparent that extreme care and\naccurate fabrication techniques must be exercised. For this reason, Rockwell\ndeveloped a specific area for polyimide layup, which.is maintained under\nclean room conditions with temperature/humidity controls.\nThe need of resin content control to achieve the nonflammability of PI\nglass laminates requires a unique approach to the fabrication of laminated\ncomponents. Rockwell has developed a technique that assures minimum resin\ncontent variability. The process steps are not difficult, but must be\nstrictly adhered to for production of high-quality parts under production\nconditions. The initial test specimen fabrication phase of this program\nincluded the use of (1) standard vacuum-bag techniques, (2) vacuum bag plus\naugmented autoclave pressure, and (3) platen press laminating. All were\nsuccessfully used to produce PI/glass parts for Apollo. A typical layup and\ncuring procedure followed in fabricating both parts for the-Apollo vehicle\nand the various items fabricated in this program follows.\nLAYUP\nOne ply of fluorocarbon parting fabric, Stern & Stern T-83-42 or equivalent,\nshall be placed on the surface and allowed to overhang the layup by 1/2 inch,\nminimum. Eight plies of bleeder fabric, Thalco EM 10A-1100 or equivalent,\nshall be applied on the parting fabric. All edges shall be sealed with a\nfluorocarbon tape and pigtailed to the layup to provide uniform vacuum distribution. A heat-resistant vacuum bag and bag sealant shall be used.\nCURE CYCLE\nApply an initial vacuum of 26 inches of mercury, minimum, as measured\nfrom the vacuum static line and insert assembly in autoclave. Pressurize\nPressure\nautoclave to obtain a pressure differential of 45 \xc2\xb1 10 lb/in. 2\ndifferential is defined as the difference between the vacuum static line\ngauge pressure and the autoclave gauge pressure. Heat the laminate to 295 0 F\n2\nin 90-240 minutes while maintaining a pressure differential of 45 \xc2\xb1 10 lb/in.\nWhen part temperature (as measured by the hottest thermocouple) reaches 295 0 F,\nincrease temperature and pressure differential at a gradual rate to 330\xc2\xb0F (as\nmeasured by the coldest thermocouple) and 85-100 lb/in. 2 in a period of\n0\n55 \xc2\xb1 10 minutes. Hold at 340 \xc2\xb1 10 F and 85-100 lb/in. 2 pressure differential\n\n-\n\n10 -\n\nSpace Division\nRockwell International\n\nfor 180 minutes, minimum. Cool to 200*F under a pressure differential of\nCool to 150 0 F or less under a pressure differential of at\n85-100 lb/in.2\n2\nleast 10 ib/in.\nPOST-CURE\nTest laminates shall be post-cured per the following cycle:\n2 hours at 250 \xc2\xb1 100 F\n2 hours at 300 \xc2\xb1 10\xc2\xb0F\n2 hours at 400 \xc2\xb1 10 0 F\n\n2 hours at 500 + 100 F\n8 hours at 600 \xc2\xb1 100 F\nCool to 150 0 F or less in oven\n\nTOOLING\nAn interesting tooling concept used on the Apollo PI/GL program involved\nfabrication of the food containers. Due to undercuts, dimensional changes\nand schedule requirements from spacecraft to spacecraft, it was decided that\nthe most economical tooling material was a breakaway plaster. However, the\nuse of plaster at first was discarded because of the constant presence of\nmoisture within the plaster. This was solved by the use of a thin spray of\nRTV silicone rubber over the plaster. In addition to serving as a seal, the\nRTV is an excellent mold release. This innovation eventually led to the first\nPI-laminated food container to be tested. Two weeks after receipt of an\naluminum food container from Houston, Rockwell delivered an exact duplicate\nPI food container. A photographic sequence of the first food container production, along with other typical PI production assemblies, is shown in Figure 3.\nFlammability test of the first PI food container is compared against an earlier\nepoxy/glass test article, as shown in Figure 4. The GL/RD box was entirely\nburned, while the PI box shows only a slight discoloration at the ignition\npoint.\nTooling, outside of shop aids, for each of the articles fabricated is\ndiscussed under each task in subsequent section of this report.\n\n- 11 -\n\nI t\n1.

Each product was fabricated from DuPont\'s\n35-503 prepreg, which is a combination of DuPont\'s 4701 (commercial designation of PI 2501) polyimide resin and standard 181 weave E glass fabric with\n1100 finish. Cutting and trimming of the prepreg followed standard aerospace\npractice. Layup, bagging, and curing procedures followed those discussed\nelsewhere in this report. The tooling used for each component fabricated is\nbriefly discussed under each task heading.\n\nTASK 1\n\nITEM A - WASTE CONTAINER (Figure 1-1)\nTask Description\nThis assembly shall be 12 x 21 x 6 inches (outside dimensions) and shall\nhave a wall thickness of approximately 0.03 inches. The exterior surface\nshall be smooth. The assembly shall have a removable top held in place by\nfriction (detents are permissible). A door 5 x 5 inches shall be built into\none end of the contained top and shall be supplied with a handle and some\nmechanism (detent, latch, or other) to hold it closed.\nDiscussion\nThis two-part waste container was fabricated from four plies of DuPont\n35-503 prepreg on an aluminum tool welded up from aluminum plate. All surfaces\nwere machined to obtain the necessary dimensions and surface smoothness. Minor\noil canning of the upper and lower sections of the waste container occurred\nafter the original post-cure. This problem was solved by using an expansion\nfixture and subjecting the part to a second post-cure cycle.\nITEM B - REFUSE COMPACTOR CANISTER\n\nWork on this item was canceled at the request of NASA.\nITEM C - LIGHTWEIGHT PANEL (Figure 1-2)\nTask Description\nFabricate a lightweight structural panel 12 x 12 x 1/2 inch by sandwiching rigid polyimide foam (20 pcf maximum) between two hard-surface 1 inates\nof polyimide resin and glass.

Helmets shall be identical to prototype previously shipped to\nNASA JSC.\nDISCUSSION\nTwo fireman hat tools were received on loan from American Sports Co.\nThe first tool break-in trial run resulted in a precipitated polymer cure\ncondition. This was attributed to the high flow (required for Apollo use\nto obtain low resin content) condition of the Pyralin 35-503 prepreg material.\nTo obtain a high impact property on the helmet, a higher resin content was\nrequired. To obtain this higher resin content, the following tests were\nconducted:\n1. Less bleeder fabric - This was attempted in the first helmet and\nresulted in polymer precipitation.\n2. Stage cure 35-503 at a longer time in the lower temperature\nregime; i.e., 200*F for 16 hours under full vacuum.\n3. Change to a higher staged, lower flow prepreg such as 35-512.

The panel is for\na capability demonstration only. Dimensions not specified are left to the\nfabricator\'s discretion.\nDISCUSSION\n3\nThis interior sandwich panel (solid door) was fabricated from 16 lb/ft\nsyntactic foam PI core and two-ply PI 35-503 laminate skins bonded to the\ncore with room temperature curing Hysol 954 epoxy adhesive. Dimensions of the\nfoam core were changed to improve structural properties and fabricability of\nthe sandwich panel. Core thickness was increased from 0.1 to 0.25 inches and\nwidth of the peripheral picture frame and all intermediate members was\nincreased from 3/8 to 1 inch. To improve the strength further as well as\nreduce the oil canning of the PI skin, a third 22-inch-long intermediate foam\ncore member, running normal to the minor panel dimension, was added to the\ncenter of the panel.\n\nThe core was made up of one-inch-wide strips of appropriate lengths cut\nfrom a solid rectangular piece of 0.25-in.-thick PI foam core. These strips\nwere subsequently bonded at all intersections over the integral core block\ndesign selected to save material, tooling, machining, and processing costs.\nBleeding of the Hysol 954 adhesive through the porous PI skins presented\nan aesthetic problem, which was minimized by closer control of adhesive thickness. A doctor blade proved adequate for this purpose.\nIf additional panels of Task 11 configuration are fabricated, it is\nsuggested that (1) more core members of thickness skins be used to reduce\nskin oil canning, (2) core strength be increased through a density increase\nor improved material selection or formulation to improve panel durability,\nand (3) peel strength be increased and bleed-through problems reduced by using\nan approved unsupport, high-peel, controlled-thickness adhesive such as\nFM-1000. This bonding technique effectively eliminated adhesive bleed-through\nproblems encountered in Task 11 panel fabrication without effecting bond\nstrength, which is core-property-dependent.\n\n- 44 -\n\nSSpace Division\n\nRockwell International\n\nI24\n\nIN.\n\nI\n\n16 LB/FT 3 SYNTACTIC\nPOLYMIDE\nFOAM\n\n36 in.1\n\nI\n\nI\n\nII\n\nI\n\nTWO PLIES DUPONT\n\nT\n\n. 25 IN.

Dimensions\nis\nprovided are approximate, and tolerances are not critical. The door panel\nfor a capability demonstration only. Dimensions not specified are left to the\nfabricator\'s discretion.\nDISCUSSION\nAn interior sliding door panel resembling a rolltop desk cover was fabricated from 16 lb/ft 3 PI syntactic foam, a two-ply PI 35-503 laminate, Durette\n7 oz/yd 2 cloth, and Hysol 954 epoxy adhesive. The thickness of the PI foam,\nfabricated fron a proprietary Rockwell formulation, was increased from the\noriginal 0.1 inch to 0.25 inches to strengthen and rigidize the panel design.\nSubsequently, the main 3/8-inch-wide x 24-inch-long door segments were machined\nfrom an open-faced sandwich panel made earlier by laying up and curing the PI\nlaminate directly on the flat machined-to-thickness foam core block. Peel\nproperties of both ends of the panel were increased by extending the upper\nlayer of the two-ply skin over the 24-inch ends of the PI foam core. Bond\nbetween the skin and core was effected by the excess PI resin in the PI 35-503.\nThe 3/8-inch x 24-inch elements were bonded to the flexible Durette fabric\nwith Hysol 954 adhesive, carefully doctor-bladed onto the foamed surface opposite the PI laminate. While control of adhesive width and thickness was possible on the foam, the variable wetting characteristic of the Durette fabric\nresulted in an irregular bleed-through pattern on the opposite side of the\nfabric. Some resin extended into the hinge area between elements, but because\nthe adhesive was thin, did not adversely affect fabric flexibility.\nThe recommendations made for improving Task 11 panel also apply here,\nwith emphasis on controlling bleed-through and peel properties.\n\n- 46 -\n\n7011-86-103B\n\nNN\n\n00\n\nFigure 12-1.\n\nArticulated Sliding Door Panel\n\nRockwell International\n\nTASK 13\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION (Figure 13-1)\nFabricate one adjustable shutter assembly primarily utilizing PI 35-503\nresin/glass cloth laminate as the structural material. In accordance with\nFigure 13-2, the assembly shall have a base support adequate for standing the\nassembly upright for display, polyimide slats secured to the vertical members\nby bonding to strips of Durette tape, and an adjustment mechanism for varying\nthe view angle through the louvers. The adjustable assembly is for capability\ndemonstration only; dimensions provided are approximate, and tolerances are\nnot critical. Other concepts of adjusting the lower view angle may be submitted by the vendor for consideration if desired. Dimensions not specified\nare left to the fabricator\'s discretion.\nDISCUSSION\nThe adjustable shutter assembly panel, which is essentially a space-age\nVenetian blind, was fabricated from PI 35-503 horizontal blinds and vertical\nchannel frame members, Durette 400 fabric tape flexible joints, Hysol 954\nadhesive, aluminum adjusting mechanism, and a limited amount of PI foam to\nstiffen the vertical PI channels. While it was the most complicated of the\nthree panels fabricated, no difficulties arose, not even the adhesive bleedthrough problem noted on the other interior panel structures. The only suggestion for future units of this type is to use high-peel FM-1000-type adhesive to improve long-time durability of peel prone joints.\n\n- 48 -\n\n0\nFigure 13-1.\n\nAdjustable Shutter Assembly in Open and Closed Positions\n\na)B\n:3\no\na,\n0\n\nSSpace Division\n\nRockwell International\n\nKNURLED LOCKING\n\nPIN\n\nKNOB - ONE SIDE-ONLY\n\nAFT W\nLINKAGE\nFIXED TO\nEACH END\n\nFLAT PI\n1/4 MIN\nPI CHANNEL\n\n-\n\nAL OR PI\nBRACKETS\nAND LINKS\n\n,-RIVETAND/OR\nBOND\n\nS\n\n1 1/2\n12\n18\n\nC\n\nKNURLED KNOB THREADED TO PIN ATTACHMENT\nTO PROVIDE VARIABLE SHUTTER POSITION LOCKING\n\n(RT SIDE ONLY)\n\nA\nBOND WITH HYSOL 954 OR\n5\n\nSIMILAR ADHESIVE\n\n0\n\nNOTES:\n3\n\n1\n1/\n\nIN.

Three plies of DuPont 35-503 polyimide/glass and one ply\nof DuPont open weave 3001/16-453 acoustical material made up the back and\nfront surface, respectively, of Panel 1 and Panel 2. Low-cost core polyimide\nfabricated by Rockwell was used as the sandwich material in both panels.\n(Refer to Task 15 for core fabrication details.) Monsanto\'s RI 7271-01\npolyimide foam, free-foamed to an average density of 1 pcf around the low cost\nPI core, was used as the acoustical insulation for Panel 1, while 0.6 pcf aircraft fiberglass insulation served as the energy-absorbing medium for Panel 2.\nThe three-ply back face laminate for Panel 1 was bonded to the low-cost\ncore with the Monsanto RI 7271-01 PI foam material during the free foaming of\nthe foam around the core. No auxiliary adhesive system was used. The front\none-ply acoustical PI glass laminate was bonded to the low-cost core modes\nwith Hexcel HP 974 polyimide paste adhesive. The blue perforated Tedlar\ndecorative surface was bonded to the one-ply polyimide glass laminate with a\nheat-activated thermal plastic adhesive coating, which was applied to the back\nsurface of the Tedlar by the vendor.\nOnce the fiberglass insulation was in place (Figure 14-3), the three-ply\nback face laminate for Panel 2 was bonded to the PI core with Hysol roomtemperature-curing 954 epoxy resin. Before additional insulation was placed\non the opposite side of the PI low-cost core, the one-ply acoustical PI glass\nlaminate was bonded to the core nodes with Hysol 954 epoxy adhesive. A white\nperforated decorative surface for Panel 2 was bonded to the PI glass laminate\nin the same manner as for Panel 1.\nFigure 14-1 shows both acoustical panels with perforated Tedlar decorative\nsurface bond to open weave PI/glass sandwich face.\n\n- 54 -\n\nLn\n\nV\n\nFigure 14-3. of Sound Absorbing Panel No. 2\nSequence Fabrication\n\nFigure 14-3.\n\nFabrication Sequence of Sound Absorbing Panel No. 2\n\nSpace Division\nRockwell International\n\nTASK 15\n\nTASK DESCRIPTION\nDefine and evaluate the structural properties of polyimide quadricore in\nsandwich applications:\n1.

Prepare and deliver to NASA a formal report delineating the test\ndata of Part 2 and the analysis of Part 3 above.\nDISCUSSION\nProperties of the polyimide low-cost core material were developed as\nrequested. Test data, as well as R&D activity pursued in optimizing the\nPI core, are presented.\nSince their conception, honeycomb sandwich structures have seen a\nphenomenal usage growth in both the aerospace and commercial industries. The\ninherent strength-to-weight ratio of a honeycomb panel in comparison to a\nsolid sheet material has provided a tremendous advantage, primarily in the\nextremely weight-conscious aerospace industry. The mechanics of a sandwich\nstructure design will not be discussed since they are quite familiar to stress,\ndesign, R&D, and process engineers.\nOne of the main objectives in the aerospace industry today is reduction\nof the initial and operational costs of structural and nonstructural hardware.\nOne of the more costly materials used for high-temperature applications is\npolyimide honeycomb core. A recent review of commercial core materials and\n\n-\n\n56 -\n\nSpace Division\nRockwell International\n\nmanufacturing processing has revealed a low-cost core fabrication approach\nthat, with modification, could produce a high-temperature polyimide core that\nwould be cost-effective in secondary and nonstructural high-temperature\naerospace applications.\nThis material is formed into a dimpled patterm similar to quadricore to\nestablish both height and formability for the core material. This core has\nthe additional advantage in that its properties are isotropic, whereas honeycomb has significant directional differences in its strength. Until recently\nquadricore has been prepared primarily from unreinforced thermoplastic with\nattendant restriction upon its thermal performance. However, work at Rockwell\nInternation Space Division has shown that core can be prepared from glass\nfabric and polyimide-resin so that both high-temperature and high mechanical\nperformance can be anticipated with it.\nThis effort primarily encompassed the following tasks:\n1. A survey of the core industry and analyses of configurations\nfor low-cost manufacturing applicability.\n2. Determination of tooling requirements.\n3. Selection of glass reinforcement materials for subsequent\npolyimide-resin impregnation adaptable to the selected core\nconfiguration requirements.\n4. Fabrication of core samples and development of basic physical\nproperty characteristics.\nCore Configuration\nIndustry Survey\nA survey was conducted of the various core configurations used in the\naerospace and commercial industries for sandwich constructions of all types.\nThis included the hexagonal or standard honeycomb, the predominant core\nconfiguration; overexpanded (OX) core, a rectangular structure; sine wave\ntypes (both flex-core and multi-wave), which feature exceptional formable\nproperties; and a formed core design. Figure 15-1 presents some of the various\ncore configurations. There are, of course, other types, but they are custom,\noften complex, constructions and not feasible in production of a low-cost\nmaterial.\nThe configuration selected for this program was a formed core egg-crateresintype readily adaptable to the use of a stretch-type or knit polyimide\nforming a single-sheet core. This would eliminate\nimpregnated glass fabric for\nthe more costly process of coating and slitting materials and bonding process\ninvolving more complex tooling in manufacture of the hexagonal or honeycombtype core structures.\n\n-\n\n57 -\n\nRockwell International\n\nT\n\nW 7\nDIDRECTION\n\nL\n\nL\nDIRECTION\n\nHEXAGONAL CELL\nDDIREIECTIONTION\nLL\nDIRECTION\n\nCELL\n\nFLEX-COREOVEREXPANDED\nDIRECTIODIRECTION\n\nMULTI-WAVE\n\nFORMED CORE\nFigure 15-1.\n\nCore Configurations\n- 58 -\n\nSpace Division\n\nRockwell International\n\nCore Design Considerations\nThe design consists of trusses gusseted in two directions. The trusses\ntranslate most imposed flexural loads into compression and tension of the\ncore and surfaces. Thus, core shear is minimized with this geometry.\nThese core structures have edge-bearing capabilities equal to or\nsuperior to honeycomb because of the core\'s ability to carry a major portion\nof the load as well as furnish relatively high values in flexure as compared\nto other core structures. Stacking of the core node to node, as shown in\nFigure 15-2, develops a multiple truss pattern that synergistically increases\nstructural values in bending. Stacking and bonding of core, as shown in\nFigure 15-2, provides a structure that resists bending forces even without\naddition of skins to complete the sandwich structure. Note also the formability of formed core as shown in the same figure.. Thus, the configuration\ndisplays both stiffness and formability.\nThe efficiency of the core structure is determined by a precise formula\nthat defines node diameter, node spacing, and depth of cross section. The\ndesign is isotropic; that is, it has equal load-bearing capabilities for both\nlength and width. It is also synclastic, having the same kind of curvature\nin all directions, and may be easily formed in simple or contoured curves\nwithout crushing or expensive machining.\nAdditional Features\nInsulation. The core exhibits K factors superior to honeycomb (hexagonal)\ncore since it provides longer paths of thermal "travel" and is readily\nadaptable to "dropping in" perforated sheets of foam sheet or fiberglass to\ngreatly enhance the K factors. Figure 15-3 presents comparative thermal\nconductivity data on honeycomb versus formed core.\nContinuous Plenum. The structure has readily available space for wiring,\nplumbing, or purging without modifications or cutouts, as is necessary with\nstandard honeycomb core.\nEnergy Absorption. The core construction minimizes catastrophic failure\nresulting from localized damage as it does not readily propagate to surrounding\nareas.\nAcoustical or Attenuation Properties. Acoustical properties of the\nformed core construction exhibit high sound or energy absorption coefficients,\nwhich can be significantly increased by the use of foam sheet or fiberglass.\nFigure 15-4 is a typical formed core attenuation graph.\nMaterial Development\nReinforcement Selection\nThe reinforcement selected for this program was a high-strength, nonflammable, high-temperature-resistant, stretchable material--a good description\nof a knit-glass fabric.

Figure 15-5 shows the polyimide-glass\nprepreg used in producing the core specimens fabricated in this study. The\nmaterial utilized a J.P. Stevens double-knit glass fabric (with an A-1100\nfinish) designated as Style 241548 and a DuPont polyimide Pyralin resin.\nMaterial Procurement\nAll known suppliers of glass fabrics and specialty weaving and knitting\nconcerns were contacted and presented the "stretch" requirements deemed\nnecessary for adaptation to the formed-core configuration.\nAvailability of knit glass fabrics for adaptation to the selected core\nconfiguration proved to be scarce. Generally, the samples that were procured\nprimarily possessed unidirectional stretch characteristics and did not avail\nthemselves to low-cost processing techniques. They could be worked into the\nformed-core mold form but did not display the desired orthotropic stretch\nproperties wherein the fabric could be applied to the female mold surface\nwithout preforming and then formed and cured with the use of matched molds.\nThe great demand for glass fabrics (in the past year it has exceeded supplies)\ncontributed to some lack of interest displayed by many of the firms contacted.\nOwens-Corning Development Laboratories, Ashton, R.I., and Prodesco, Inc.,\nPerkasie, Pa., however, have shown considerable interest in developing glass\nknits for this program. Their cooperation will be a key element in the further\ndevelopment of a variety of medium density, semi-structural, ultra-lightweight\nnonstructural cores.\n\nFigure 15-5. Polyimide-Resin Impregnated\nDouble-Knit Glass Fabric\n- 62 -\n\nTooling Development\nMatched Tools\nDevelopment of tooling to produce the polyimide-resin knit-glassreinforced core was initiated by obtaining Zn/Al alloy core from Quadricore,\nInc., Pico Rivera, California. The Zn/Al core selected for use in producing\nthe matched molds had node diameters of 1/2 inch, node spacings of 1 inch,\nand a cross-sectional height of 3/4 of an inch.\nThe Zn/Al core was coated with a release agent, and a high-temperature\nmolds with\nepoxy casting resin was poured onto each side to produce matched\n10 mils, the thickness of the Zn/Al core. The\nan offset of approximately\n0\nmolds were post-cured at 350 to 400 F for four hours to develop high-temperature\nproperties. The molds are shown in Figure 15-6.\nThough core samples were produced by using the matched mold tooling,\ncore.\nthis technique has quite a few disadvantages in making the formed\n1.\n\nsets\nCost of matched mold tooling is relatively expensive since new\nfor\nof matched molds with various offsets would have to be produced\ndifferent thicknesses of glass reinforcements.\n\n2.\n\nThermal conductivity of the epoxy mold is rather low and involves\na rather lengthy cure time in a heating oven.\n\n3.\n\nThe vacuum-bagging operation to develop cure pressure is time\nconsuming and does not lend itself to a truly low-cost process.\n\nVacuum Forming\nBecause of the listed disadvantages in using matched mold tooling,\nonto Zn/Al and\nvacuum-forming tools were fabricated by casting epoxy resins\nproduce a forming tool.

None of the materials would adequately stretch over and into the mold configuration unless material was laid\nover the mold and then pushed into each cell consecutively before the matched\nmold was applied, as shown in Figure 15-9. Even with assist tooling, which\nmight conceivably perform this job mechanically, it is difficult to perceive\nusing this material in a truly low-cost operation.\nThe tool containing the polyimide/glass prepreg was then vacuum-bagged,\n0\nplaced in an oven, and cured at 350 F for one hour. After the tool was\ncooled, the core was removed from the tool and placed in an oven. The temper0\nature was raised from room temperature to 600 F in approximately three hours,\nand the core was post-cured at 600\xc2\xb0F for one hour. This post-cure is necessary for removal of all volatile matter, complete polymerization of the\npolyimide, and for production of an essentially nonflammable core material\neven when exposed to flame in a 100-percent-oxygen atmosphere.\nA core sample using a J.P. Stevens double-knit glass fabric impregnated\nwith a DuPont Pyralin resin is shown in Figure 15-10. This material produced\n3\na relatively light core structure of approximately 2.3 ib/ft . In the same\nphotograph is a sample of an ultra-lightweight core material produced from a\nsmall sample of very light, thin-gauge, glass fabric. This structure 3 proved\nto be too flimsy, but does show that cores lighter than the 2.3 lb/ft are\nfeasible, and efforts to produce lighter cores for nonstructural panels are\n3\nplanned for the future. Figure 15-11 shows the 2.3 b/ft core bonded to\npolyimide/glass laminate skins with a polyimide adhesive. This combination\nprovides a relatively lightweight, semi-structural, nonflammable sandwich\npanel that should find use in aerospace and possibly in the commercial\nindustry.\nStructural Properties\nSpecimen Fabrication\nTest specimens were fabricated to provide test data on flatwise and\nedgewise compression strength, shear strength and modulus of elasticity, and\nflatwise tensile strength.

Values, therefore, are\nconservative and a reflection of the low rigidity of the quadricore.\n- 71 -\n\nRockwell International\n\nAs shown in Table 15-1 for the type of glass/PI quadricore studied in this\nprogram, the average values for core shear, flatwise tension, flatwise compression, and edgewise compression were respectively 19.3, 42.6, 24.9, and\n5065 lb/in. 2 . These values are substantially lower than the level of strength\nobtainable with aluminum honeycomb of similar density.\nDiscussion of Results\nAlthough the level of strength achieved with the glass/PI quadricore\nwas discouraging, the data must be viewed in light of the state of development\nof this material and the types of failure observed. In all instances, buckling or yield type of failure occurred. Thus, substantially no fracturing\nof the glass reinforcement, which is intended to be the primary contributor\nto the strength of this material, was observed. In itself this observation\nestablishes that the structural potential of glass/PI quadricore is much\ngreater than has been achieved thus far.\nFor glass fiber to work efficiently, structurally in compression or\nshear, it must be well stabilized. One primary function of the resin in a\nglass fiber composite is to stabilize the fibers. The resin establishes the\ngeometrical shape of the fiber mass and hardens it so that the fibers may\nwork together rather than individually. If insufficient resin is present,\nthe fibers will act as highly flexible members and will tend to display a\n"false" yielding behavior rather than fracturing when loaded. The minimum\namount of resin required is a function of the form in which the fibers are\nused. Woven glass fiber cloth, unidirectional rovings, and twisted yarns\neach require different minimum resin content to achieve a similar level of\nstability.\nA second fundamental influence upon the rigidity of a glass fiber\ncomposite is the void content of the composite. At a given level of resin\ncontent, apparent rigidity in compression and shear will decrease as void\ncontent increases. These two factors together with the physical form of\nthe fibers and the shape of the structure member will determine the\nstructural capability of the material. In the opinion of the author, the\nshape of glass/PI quadricore, although influenced by dimple dimension and\narea density, is such that it should function satisfactorily as a structural\ncore in sandwich members, but only if the other requirements for a structural composite are satisfied. Thus, the deficiencies of the quadricore\ntested are not to be viewed as a necessary constraint upon the structural\npotential of this material, but rather as proof of the type f .improvements\nnecessary to develop it into a satisfactory structural material. Suggestions for approaches to the elimination of the problem are given in Conclusion and Recommendations.\n\n- 72 -\n\nRockwell International\n\nConclusion and Recommendations\nAlthough the level of mechanical performance achieved in this study was\ndisappointing and would not qualify glass/polyimide quadricore as a structural core material, additional development should improve structural performance greatly. There does not appear to be a theoretical basis that would\nprevent this achievement.\nIt is recommended that the primary initial effort in further development\nof this core material be directed toward characteristics that will improve\nits rigidity. Some suggestions follow:\n1. A higher ratio of resin to glass. This could be achieved without\nsubstantial change in core density by reducing the coarseness of\nthe yarn.\n2. Reduce the dimple diameter, height and/or spacing.\n3. Consider other than knitted fabrics which tend to have high\nelongation.\nIt is also recommended that removing (punching out) the material at\nthe base and top of the dimples be considered. The material in these\nregions makes a minor contribution to the performance of quadricore as a\ncore material, but a substantial contribution to its weight. With proper\nbonding, only the sidewalls of the dimples are required for strength and\nstiffness in the region between the skins. This removal of material would\nsubstantially reduce the weight of the core and allows this weight saving to\nbe redistributed to the sidewalls (as additional resin, for example), which\nwill assist in achieving greater sidewall rigidity.\n\n-\n\n73 -\n\nNEW DEVELOPMENT AND POTENTIAL USES-\n\nC,\n\nC,\nLU\n\n-J\n\ncm\n\nLU\n\nLU\n\nSpace Division\nRockwell International\n\nNEW DEVELOPMENT AND POTENTIAL USES\nCURRENT DEVELOPMENTS IN POLYIMIDE MATERIALS\n\nSignificant changes have taken place since the development of polyimide\nresins in 1950\'s and the introduction of polyimide/glass prepregs in 1960\'s\nfor aircraft/aerospace and commercial applications. The number of suppliers\nof polyimide resins and related products have increased, the number, type,\nand quality of polyimide materials have increased, and the processing\ncharacteristics of polyimides have improved significantly.\nDuPont\'s early work was closely followed by polyimide resin developments\nat Monsanto and in later years by companies such as Ciba-Geigy, Rhodia Inc.,\nUpjohn Company, TRW, and Hughes Aircraft Company. The DuPont PI 2501 and the\ncontrolled flow version of this resin, PI 4701, used in the fabrication of\nthe various Apollo space parts and the items fabricated in Tasks 1-15 of this\nprogram are classified as condensation reaction polymers. Solvents and\nreaction products created by these condensation PI systems greatly complicated\nthe fabrication of PI/glass parts. This subject has been discussed elsewhere\nin this report. Recently polyimides with improved processing properties have\nbeen introduced to the aircraft/aerospace industry. They differ from those\ndescribed above in that they are formed from so-called bis-maleinides. These\ncure via an addition reaction. These polymers can be prepared in many ways,\nbut are all exemplified by being end-capped with unsaturated linkages which,\nwhen subjected to heat, react and cross-link by addition across the double bond:\n\nH\nI\nC\n\n0\nII\nC\n\n0\nII\nC\n\nH\nI\nC\n\niN-R-N\nC-C\nI\nH\n\n/\n\nC\nII\n0\n\nAMINE\n\n\\\n\nC\nII\n0\n\nCC\nI\nH\n\nRETICULATED POLYIMIDE (ADDITION\nREACTIONS)\n\nA\n\nThe advantages offered by bis-maleinides are ease of fabrication (low\ntemperature - 350 0 F - curing), extremely low voids (no condensate needs\nremoval) lower post-cure temperatures, and potentially lower cost. Primary\ndisadvantages are significantly lower thermal stability than condensation\npolyimide (1000 F lower- long term) prepregs, low drape and tack properties,\nand fire and smoke resistance not comparable to condensation polyimides (will\nburn and smoke in 100-percent-oxygen atmosphere). Nevertheless, these systems\nare still far superior to epoxies. Modifications of straight bis-maleinides\nhave been investigated. A new system represented by DuPont\'s PI 30003 offers\n\npreceding page blank\n- 75 -\n\nDSD\n\n7-SHSD 75-SH-0068\n\nRockwell International\n\nmany of the advantages of bis-maleimides, but does have thermal stabilities in\nexcess of nonmodified systems (upper use temperature 500 0 F). The major\ndisadvantage is the long post-cure cycle required.\nA third type of polyimide was introduced by DuPont in 1971 (NR-150). This\npolyimide follows essentially the condensation route, except that the final\ncured product is soluble in selected organic solvents (normal condensation type\nPI\'s are not, e.g., DuPont\'s 3001 and 3002). The advantage of such systems is\nthat they allow for reaction with no condensate removal, only solvent. Prepregs of NR-150 are supplied as completely cured polyimides. Advantages include\nlow voids, excellent fire and smoke resistance, and thermal stability as good\nas 3001 or 3002. Primary disadvantage is its severe fabrication conditions\n(200 lb/in.2 at 600*F or higher).\nFabrication techniques generally follow standard vacuum-bag procedures.\nMore recently, vacuum bag/autoclave techniques have been developed whereby\nparts with significantly lower void contents have been realized. Dielectric\nmonitoring devices are a significant aid in preparing parts with this latter\ntechnique. Use of such instruments allows for proper selection of when to\napply autoclave pressure. Yields have significantly improved when dielectric\nmonitoring is employed. Proper layup and bleeder assemblies are also extremely\nimportant in polyimide parts manufacture. Again, through a learning curve\nrequiring a number of years, optimum layup procedures have been developed.\nThis section is not intended to discuss all of the new polyimide systems\nthat have become available, only to bring attention to the dynamic advancements evident in the development of new PI resin systems. A partial listing\nof those PI products which are available is presented in Table 4. It has\nbeen projected that with the combination of high-temperature strength, low\nflammability, ease of processing, and low moisture absorption (Figures 5\nthrough 8) that polyimide resins will supplant epoxies as the standard resin\nin the aerospace industry in the next five to ten years.\nTable 4.

Catastrophic situations cannot be tolerated in an enclosed vehicle\nwhether it be traveling through space, under the sea, or on the surface of\nthe earth. The Office of Safety and Health Administration has developed new\nand more stringent safety requirements, which must be met by careful selection\nof materials by designer. The courts are awarding large sums in damage suits\nagainst companies whose products have failed to operate safely in the hands\nof the purchaser. An Aviation Week article discusses the problems future\naircraft designers and their companies can face in-the courts if aircraft are\nnot adequately designed to provide optimum survivability of passenger during\nair or landing mishaps. The proper application of polyimide resin base\nstructures, while not a cureall, could contribute significantly to a lessening\nof safety hazards. Some of the areas that can benefit from one or all of the\nnonflammable, self-extinguishing, low outgassing, low-smoke-generating, high\ndielectric, good thermal and electrical insulating, and good elevated temperature structural properties of polyimide materials are suggested below. These\nPI properties can be translated into products which can:\n1. Minimize the initiation of a fire.\n2. Contain a fire and minimize its rate of propagation.\n3.
