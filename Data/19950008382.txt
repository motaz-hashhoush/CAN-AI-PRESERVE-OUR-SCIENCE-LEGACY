These effects were assessed by examining\nthe biochemical\nand morphological\nproperties\nof\nmuscle fibers obtained\nfrom biopsies in young Rhesus monkeys\n(3-4 Kg).\nBiopsies taken from\nground base experiments\nwere analyzed to determine:\n1) the effects of chair restraint\nat 1 G on\nmuscle properties\nand 2) the growth rate of flexor and extensor muscles in the Rhesus.\nIn\naddition, two sets of biopsies were taken from monkeys\nwhich were in the flight pool and the four\nmonkeys\nthat flew on the Cosmos 2044 and 2229 biosatellite\nmissions.\nThese studies were done\nin collaboration\nwith Drs. V.R. Edgerton,\nR.R. Roy and J.A. Hodgson\nat UCLA.\nHYPOTHESES\nMuscle fibers will atrophy when subjected to a 0 gravity environment.\nBased on previous\ndata obtained in rats after a 5-14 day spaceflight\nand after hindlimb suspension,\nwe\nhypothesize\nthat muscle fibers in a slow muscle will atrophy more rapidly than fibers in a\nfast muscle, and slow fibers in either a predominantly\nslow or mixed muscle will atrophy\nmore than fast fibers.\nThe normal oxidative\nand glycolytic potential\nrapid phases of muscle atrophy while myosin\nslow toward fast types.\n\nof muscle fibers will be sustained\nduring the\nisozymes\nof some fibers will change from\n\nOBJECTIVE\nDefine the degree of muscle atrophy and metabolic\nchanges\nthe VL, SOL, MG, and TA after 14 days of spaceflight.\n\nthat occur\n\nin muscle\n\nfibers\n\nof\n\nMETHODS\n\nBIOPSY\n\nPROCEDURES\n\nfor Cosmos\n\n2044\n\nMuscle biopsies were obtained pre- and postflight in two male monkeys\nflown on\nCosmos 2044, a 14-day spaceflight,\nand in four control monkeys\nof approximately\nthe\nsame body weight, age and sex. The flight monkeys\n(782 and 2483) weighed\n3.9 and 3.8\nKg, respectively,\nand were 3 years 6 months old at the time of the flight. Each of these\nmonkeys\ngained approximately\n300 grams between the time that the pre and postflight\nbiopsies were taken. The four control monkeys\n(2471,839,\n2442, 2587) were part of the\nflight candidate\npool and, consequently,\nreceived the same training and restraint as the two\nmonkeys\nchosen for flight. The control monkeys\nweighed\nbetween 4.0 and 4.2 Kg at the\ntime of the flight and gained approximately\n500 grams between the time that the pre and\npostflight\nbiopsies were taken. The control monkeys\nremained\nin their individual\ncages\nduring the 14-day flight and were fed the same diet as the flight monkeys.\nBiopsies were taken from two independent\nsites in the Sol, MG and TA muscles\nusing a small (3-mm diameter)\nBergstrom\nbiopsy needle (Figure 1). The first (preflight)\nbiopsies were taken 107 days prior to launch,\nand the second (postflight)\nbiopsies were\ntaken 24 hours after the recovery\nof the capsule.\nAll biopsies were taken from the right leg\nsince the left leg was implanted\nwith EMG electrodes.\nThe biopsies weighed between 8\n\nBODINE-FOWLER\n\n2\nPAOli\n\nIK,._NK\n\nNOT\n\nFILMED\n\nand 14 mg and contained\nbetween\n100-200 fibers of which an average of 40 + 16 fibers\nwere acceptable\nfor metabolic\nand size analyses.\nThe preflight biopsies were taken while the animal was under a general anesthesia\n(Ketamine).\nUnder sterile conditions,\none incision was made on the medial side of the\nlower leg to give access to the Sol and MG muscles, and one incision was made on the\nanterior side of the leg to give access to the TA muscle.\nUsing blunt dissection,\nthe belly of\neach muscle was exposed and a small cut was made in the overlying\nfascia. The biopsy\nneedle was inserted into the muscle parallel to the direction of the muscle fibers, and\nsuction was applied to increase the size of the biopsy.\nThe needle was withdrawn\nand the\nsample was removed\nfrom the needle and frozen in freon-12 cooled with liquid nitrogen.\nThe fascia and skin were closed with absorbable\nsutures (Vicryl "r_) and a topical antibiotic\n(Neosporin TM) was placed on the wound. The preflight biopsies were taken from the\nsuperficial,\nmedial regions of the distal Sol, the distal MG, and the proximal\nTA.\nThe postflight biopsies were taken while the animal was restrained\nin a primate\nchair (Primate Products Restraint System TM) using local anesthesia\napplied to the biopsy\nsite. A sterile field was made around the right leg and the leg was washed with betadine\nand alcohol.\nLocal anesthesia\nwas induced using a 2% lidocaine solution mixed with\nepinephrine\n(0.2 mls of 1:1000 epinephrine\nmixed with 4 mls of 2% lidocaine).\nThe\nlidocaine\nsolution was infiltrated along the incision line by inserting a needle through the\nskin and injecting lidocaine subcutaneously\n(-3-4 cc). Lidocaine\nwas occasionally\ninjected\ninto the muscle (<lcc) proximal\nto the biopsy site. When the monkey showed no reaction\nto a skin prick, an incision was made to the skin, the muscle identified\nand the biopsy taken\nas described\nabove. The postflight biopsies were taken from the superficial,\nmedial regions\nof the proximal\nSol,the proximal MG, and the distal TA.\nThe biopsy sites were selected to ensure that the same muscle fibers were not\nsampled during the pre and postflight\nbiopsies and were determined\nbased on detailed\narchitectural\nanalyses of each muscle.\nIn addition, the feasibility of obtaining reproducible\nbiopsies from the selected sites has been verified, i.e., the regions sampled within each\nmuscle have been shown to have similar fiber type distributions.\nBIOPSY\n\nPROCEDURES\n\nfor Cosmos\n\nThe biopsy procedures\nbetter quality muscle samples.\nteam.\n\n2229\n\nwere modified in Cosmos 2229 in order to obtain larger and\nAll of the biopsies were shared with the Russian Science\n\nMuscle biopsies were obtained pre- and postflight\nin two male monkeys flown on\nCosmos 2229, a 12-day spaceflight,\nand in four control monkeys\nof approximately\nthe\nsame body weight, age and sex. The four control monkeys\nwere part of the flight\ncandidate\npool and, consequently,\nreceived similar training and restraint as the two\nmonkeys\nchosen for flight. The control monkeys remained\nin their individual cages during\nthe 12-day flight and were fed the same diet as the flight monkeys.\nBiopsies were taken from two independent\nsites in the soleus (Sol), medial\ngastrocnemius\n(MG), tibialis anterior (TA) and vastus lateralis (VL) muscles using an open\nbiopsy technique.\nThe first (preflight)\nbiopsies were taken approximately\n91 days prior to\nlaunch, and the second (postflight)\nbiopsies were taken 3 to 5 days after the recovery of the\ncapsule.\nAll biopsies were taken from the right leg. The Sol, MG, TA and VL on the left\nleg were implanted\nwith EMG electro_tes and a force transducer\nwas placed on the tendon\nof the MG.\nThe biopsies were taken while the animal was under a general anesthesia.\nUnder\nsterile conditions,\nsmall incisions were made on the medial side of the lower leg to expose\nthe Sol and MG muscles, on the anterior side of the leg to expose the TA muscle, and on\nthe lateral side of the thigh to expose the VL. Using blunt dissection,\nthe belly of each\nmuscle was exposed\nand a small cut was made in the overlying\nfascia. To obtain the\n\nBODINE-FOWLER\n\n3\n\nbiopsies, the tip of a scalpel blade was used to isolate a piece of tissue approximately\n10\nmm long x 5 mm wide x 5 mm deep (-100 to 150 mg wet weight).\nAll samples were taken\nfrom the superficial\nmuscle belly and the cut was made parallel to the direction of the\nmuscle fibers. The muscle sample was removed\nand immediately\nplaced on a saline soaked\nguaze. The fascia and skin were closed with absorbable\nsutures (Vicryl _).\nThe tissue\nsample was weighed, stretched to approximately\nthe in situ length, and mounted\non cork\nusing pins to insure a perpendicular\norientation\nof the muscle fibers. The samples were\nfrozen in isopentane\ncooled with liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 \xc2\xb0 C. The preflight\nbiopsies were taken from the medial regions of the proximal\nSol, the distal MG, and the\nproximal TA.\nThe postflight biopsies were taken from the medial regions of the distal Sol\nand the distal TA; and the middle region of the proximal MG.\n\nTISSUE\n\nANALYSIS\n\nFiber Cross-Sectional\nArea:\nThe mean fiber cross-sectional\narea of each biopsy\nsample was determined\nfrom a population\nof 100 to 400 fibers measured\nfrom a serial\ncross-section\nimmunohistochemically\nstained with a monoclonal\nantibody for laminin.\nA\nVectastain\nABC TM kit (Vector Labs, Burlingame,\nCA, USA) was used to amplify the\nantigen-antibody\ncomplex, which in turn, was visualized\nby treatment\nwith a\ndiaminobenzidine\n(DAB) peroxidase\nreaction.\nLaminin stains the basal lamina just outside\nthe plasma membrane\n(26). Using a color camera attached to a light microscope\nand image\nanalysis system ( Image I-AT, Universal\nImaging Corporation),\nthe region within the\nlaminin boundaries\nwas automatically\nfilled in by the computer\nand the fiber cross-sectional\narea was calculated\n\nin I.tm 2.\n\nSuccinate dehydrogenase\nActivity ; Succinate dehydrogenase\n(SDH) activity and\nfiber cross-sectional\narea were determined\nfor individual fibers (50-90 fibers) in 10 gm\ncross sections taken from each of the biopsy samples.\nTissue sections were analyzed on a\ncomputer-assisted\nimage analysis system (Image-I/AT,\nUniversal\nImaging Corporation).\nTo measure SDH activity, repeated digitized\nimages were taken of a single tissue section\nevery 2 min over a period of 14 min while the tissue was incubated in a medium without\nthe substrate,\nsuccinate.\nA medium with succinate\nthen was added and repeated scans were\ntaken every 2 min over the next 14 min. Reaction rates for each fiber were based on a\nlinear regression\nline determined\nfrom the 8 points acquired with the medium containing\nsubstrate.\nAlthough\nthe absolute optical density readings may vary slightly from day to\nday, the slope or reaction rate is not affected.\nThe medium for determining\nSDH activity contained:\n100 mM phosphate\nbuffer\n(pH=7.6),\n1.5 mM sodium azide, 3 mM 1-methoxyphenazine\nmethylsulfate,\n1.5 mM nitro\nblue tetrazolium,\n5.5 mM EDTA-disodium\nsalt, and 58 mM succinate disodium\nsalt. This\nincubation\nmedium is a modification\nof the one used for the rat muscle and has been\noptimized\nfor the monkey muscle. The reaction rates for fibers in the monkey\napproximately\n5 times slower than those in the rat.\n\nare\n\nFi_r\nTyp\xc2\xa2_:\nFibers were classified\nas type I, IIa, IIb, IIx or hybrid (coexpression\nof slow and fast) using monoclonal\nantibodies\nwhich label the different myosin heavy chain\n(MHC) isoforms.\nSerial cross-sections\nwere incubated\nwith primary antibodies\n(BA-F8,\nBF-13, BF-35 and SC-71 generously\ndonated\nby S. Schiaffino\n(Padova,\nItaly)) overnight\nat 25\xc2\xb0C. Sections incubated\nwithout primary antibody\nwere used as controls to visualize\nnon-specific\nlabeling.\nA Vectastain\nABC TM kit (Vector Labs, Burlingame,\nCA, USA) was\n\nBODINE-FOWLER\n\n4\n\nusedto amplify theantigen-antibodyomplex,which in turn,wasvisualizedby treatment\nc\nwith a DAB peroxidase\nreaction.\nTheimmunohistochemical\nlabelingwascompared standard\nto\nhistochemical\nstainingfor myofibrillar ATPase\nafteracid(pH, 4.35)andalkaline(pH, 10.0)\npreincubation.Serialsections\nalsowerestained hemotoxylinandeosin(H&E) for\nfor\nroutinehistologicalexamination.\nElectroohoretic\nSeparation\nof MHC: The MHC isoforms were separated\nby sodium\ndocecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide\ngel electrophoresis\n(SDS-PAGE).\nFrozen muscle samples\nwere homogenized\nby hand in glass tissues grinders in 200-400 I_1 of ice-cold\nhomogenization\nbuffer [250 mM sucrose, 100 mM KC1, 5 mM EDTA, and 20 mM Tris\n(hydroxymetyl)\naminomethane\n(Tris), pH 6.8]. The myofibril homogenate\nwas boiled in\nsample buffer (23) for 2 rain at a final protein concentration\nof 0.125 _tg/I.tl.\nThe separating\ngel was composed\nof 30% glycerol, 8% acrylamide-N,N\'methylene-bis\n-acrylamide\n(bis) (50:1), 0.2M Tris (pH 8.8), 0.1M glycine and 0.4%\nsodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). The stacking gel was composed\nof 30% glycerol, 4%\nacrylamide-bis,\n70 mM Tris (pH 6.7), 4 mM EDTA and 0.4% SDS. Polymerization\nwas\ninitiated with 0.05% N,N,N\',N\'-tetramethyletheylenediamine\nand 0.1% ammonium\npersulfate.\nThe upper running buffer consisted\nof 0.1M Tris (base), 150 mM glycine and 0.1%\nSDS. The lower running buffer consisted\nof 50 mM Tris (base), 75 mM glycine and\n0.05% SDS. Both buffers were cooled to 4 \xc2\xb0 C prior to use. The entire gel unit was placed\nin a stryrofoam\nbox containing\ncooling packs to maintain the temperature\nbelow 10\xc2\xb0C. The\ngel was run at 275V (constant voltage) for 22-24 hours. Quantification\nof the protein\nbands was accomplished\nby scanning the Coomasie\nBlue stained gels with a Pharmacia\nLKB Ultrascan\nXL laser scanning densitometer.\n\nGROUND\n\nBASED\n\nTo determine\n\nEXPERIMENTS\nthe effects\n\nof restraint\n\nat 1G, three male monkeys\n\nweighing\n\nbetween\n\n3.5 to 4.1 Kg (mean 3.7 -+0.23 Kg) were placed in a replication\nof the flight chair and\nrestrained\nfor 14-days to simulate the flight duration.\nAll ground based experiments\nwere\nperformed\nat the NASA/Ames\nResearch Center.\nMuscle biopsies were taken from the Sol,\nMG, TA, and VL approximately\n2-weeks prior to the restraint and 3 days after the 14-day\nrestraint period.\nThe ground base experiments\nwere performed\nprior to the actual flight and\nwere designed\nto simulate the proposed\n14-day flight. The actual flight was shortened\nfor\ntechnical reasons and extended\nonly 12-days.\n\nBODINE-FOWLER\n\n$\n\nRESULTS\nFIBER\n\n(COSMOS\n\nCROSS-SECTIONAL\n\n2044)\nAREA\n\nThe mean cross-sectional\nareas of fibers sampled from the pre and postflight\nbiopsies of the two flight monkeys\n(782 and 2483) and the four control monkeys\n(2471,\n839, 2442, and 2587) are given in Figure 2. In several instances,\nthe biopsies were\ndamaged\n(usually due to thawing) during the storage and transfer of the biopsies and,\nconsequently,\nthere are several missing data points.\nThe 14-day spaceflight\nappeared to have no effect on fiber size in the Sol and MG\nmuscles.\nIn each of the flight animals, the mean fiber size was significantly\nlarger in the\npostflight compared\nto the preflight biopsies.\nIn both the Sol and MG there appeared\nto be\nno differential\neffect on those fibers that stained light (presumably\nslow) or dark\n(presumably\nfast) for myosin ATPase, alkaline preincubation.\nIn the Sol, the light and\ndark fibers were similar in size, whereas in the MG, the light fibers were significantly\nsmaller than the dark fibers.\nIn the control monkeys, the mean fiber size was generally\ngreater in the postflight\n(second) biopsies than in the preflight (first) biopsies.\nThe first and second biopsies in the\ncontrol monkeys\nwere taken during the same time interval as the biopsies from the flight\nmonkeys.\nGiven that these animals had not reached maturity, the increase in size most\nprobably\nreflects the growth of the muscles during this period.\nThe absolute increase in\nsize of fibers in the Sol and MG varied among the four control animals.\nFigure 3 compares\nthe increase in body weight to the increase in fiber size in the Sol and MG. In general,\nthere was a positive relationship\nbetween the absolute increase in body weight and the\nabsolute increase in fiber size. Of interest is the interrelationship\nbetween the growth in the\nSol and MG. In monkeys\n2483, 782 and 2587, the fiber size increase was approximately\nthe same in the Sol and MG. In monkeys\n2442 and 839, however,\nthere was a dissociation\nbetween the growth in these two muscles.\nIn monkey 2442, the increase in the mean fiber\nsize in the Sol was double that which occurred\nin the MG (1910 vs 914 I.tm, respectively).\nIn contrast, in monkey 839 the MG fibers doubled in size relative to the fibers in the Sol.\nIn the TA, the results are less clear regarding\nthe effects of spaceflight\nsince no\npreflight data were obtained for flight monkey 2483. In general, the fibers in the TA of the\ncontrol monkeys\nwere larger in the second than the first biopsy, but the difference\nin size\nwas not as large as that observed\nin the Sol and MG. In flight monkey 782, the postflight\nbiopsy had significantly\n(p<0.05) smaller fibers than the preflight biopsy.\nAtrophy seemed\nto have occurred\nin both fiber types in the TA of monkey 782.\nAs in the MG, the light\nfibers in the TA tended to be smaller in size than the dark fibers.\nSDH ACTIVITY\nThe mean SDH activities of the fibers sampled in the pre and postflight\nbiopsies\nfrom the flight and control monkeys\nare shown in Figure 4. In the Sol and TA muscles,\nthere was no apparent effect of spaceflight\nin that the flight monkeys\nshowed the same\ntrends as the control monkeys.\nIn contrast, the MG seemed to be affected by the 14-day\nspaceflight.\nIn the MG of control monkeys,\nthe mean SDH activity was greater in the\npostflight\nthan the preflight biopsies in those three monkeys with muscle samples at both\ntime periods.\nHowever,\nin the MG of both flight monkeys,\nthe mean SDH activity was\nless in the postflight\nthan the preflight biopsies.\nConsequently,\nSDH activity in the fibers\nof the MG appeared\nto decrease in response\nto spaceflight,\nwhile no effect on the Sol and\nTA muscle fibers was evident.\n\nBODINE-FOWLER\n\n6\n\nRESULTS (COSMOS 2229)\nThe body weights of the flight (151 and 906) and control (803, 907,775 and 1401)\nmonkeys\nat the time of the first biopsy (pre) in Sept. 1992, at the time of the launch in Dec.\n1992 and at the time of the second biopsy (post) in Jan. 1993 are shown in figure 5. Both\nflight monkeys\ngained weight between the first biopsy and the launch : 151 gained 700 gms\nand 906 gained 600 gms. During the flight, which lasted 12 days, monkey\n151 lost 700\ngms and 906 lost 200 gms. In comparison,\nthe three monkeys\nwhich were restrained\nat 1G\nfor a period of 14-days lost an average of 200 grams.\nThe loss of body weight in monkey\n906 was most likely related to fluid loss since his average daily food consumption\nduring\nthe flight was 1.2 times that on ground, whereas his total fluid intake per day was 76% that\non ground.\nIn monkey\n151, his daily food and fluid intake during the flight were 33 and\n28% of that on the ground.\nNo significant\nchanges were observed\nin the whole body lean mass or the right leg\nmass during the flight period.\nThere was a significant\nincrease (12%, p--0.03) in the right\nleg lean mass during the recovery\nperiod.\nThere was a decrease (22%, p=0.01) in right\narm lean mass during the flight period which was primarily\ndue to a large loss in flight\nmonkey\n151.\nFIBER\n\nCROSS-SECTIONAL\n\nAR]EA\n\nTo determine\nwhether atrophy occurred in response\ntomicrogravity,\nmean fiber\nareas were compared\nbetween pre and postflight biopsies from the same animal and\nbetween the postflight\nbiopsies of each flight monkey and the mean of the postflight\nbiopsies from the control monkeys\n(Table 1). There was no significant\natrophy in the Sol\nor MG based on the differences\nbetween the mean fiber sizes of the pre and postflight\nbiopsies (Table 1). However,\nthe response of each of the flight monkeys\nwas not identical.\nIn monkey 906 there was an increase in the mean fiber areas of the postflight biopsies in\nboth the Sol (112% of preflight)\nand MG (168% of preflight)\nand there was a shift in the\ndistribution\nof fiber sizes.\nIn both muscles the fast fibers showed the greatest increase\nin\nsize. In the Sol, the type I fibers showed no change in size, while there was a 3% and 19%\nincrease in size for the type IIa and hybrid fibers. In the MG, increases\nin fiber size of 14,\n31,70 and 35% were found in the type I, Ha, IIx and hybrid fibers, respectively.\nThe\nmean fiber sizes of the postflight Sol and MG biopsies were similar to the mean fiber sizes\nof the control monkeys\n(Table 1).\nIn contrast, in monkey\n151, the mean fiber areas of both the Sol and MG after flight\nwere 88% of the preflight values.\nFurther, the fiber sizes of the postflight\nbiopsies from\nthe Sol and MG were 75% and 71% of the control post biopsy means.\nFiber size\nhistograms\nillustrated\na a decrease in the percentage\nof large fibers following\nthe flight in\nboth muscles.\nIn the Sol there was no change in fibers size among the type I fibers and a\n21% decrease in the type Ha and hybrid fibers. All fiber types in the MG showed a\ndecrease\nin fiber size: 26, 13 and 20% in the type I, IIa and IIx fibers, respectively..\nThe TA in both flight monkeys\nshowed significant\n(p<.001) atrophy in response\nto\nthe spaceflight\n(Table 1). The mean fiber size of the postflight biopsies from 151 and 906\nwere 69 and 54% of the overall mean of the post biopsies from the control monkeys\n(Table\n1). In monkey\n151, atrophy was observed\nonly the type IIx fibers (30% decrease in size).\nIn contrast, in monkey 906, all fibers atrophied\n(22,22, and 31% in the type I, Ha and IIx\nfibers, respectively).\nAs was observed\nin the Sol and MG, the response\nin the VL differed for the two\nflight monkeys.\nIn monkey\n151, the mean fiber size postflight was 57% of preflight (Table\n1). Further the fiber size distribution\nchanged from a bimodal to a unimodal distribution\n\nBODINE-FOWLER\n\n7\n\nand shifted to the left (i.e., smaller sizes). In monkey 906 there was no apparent atrophy in\nthe VL as demonstrated\nby the mean fiber sizes (Table 1) and fiber size distributions.\nHowever,\nthe fact that the VL of the control monkeys\n(Table 1) and the fibers in the Sol\nand MG of the same monkey showed significant\ngrowth suggests that there may have been\nsome "atrophy"\nor slowing of growth during the flight.\nTo determine\nthe effect of chair restraint, trained monkeys were placed in a chair\nwhich resembled\nthat flown in the biosatellite\nfor a period of 14-days at 1G. In general, the\n14-day restraint had no effect on the fiber cross-sectional\nareas of the Sol, MG, TA or VL\n(Table 2). In these monkeys,\ngrowth was not a factor since the pre-restraint\nbiopsy was\ntaken approximately\ntwo-weeks\nprior to the experiment.\nThe post-restraint\nbiopsies were\ntaken 3 days after the end of the restraint procedure\nto simulate what was to occur during\nthe flight experiment.\nThe three day delay was dictated by other neurophysiological\ntests\nthat were apart of the overall flight experiment\nand had to occur immediately\nafter the flight.\n\nEmF.g..TXP_F\nMuscle\n\nfibers from\n\nthe four hindlimb\n\nmuscles\n\nstudied\n\ncould\n\nbe classified\n\ninto four\n\ntypes based on their immunohistochemical\nstaining to monoclonal\nantibodies\nto the myosin\nheavy chain. In the Sol fibers were classified\nas either type I (slow), type IIa (fast) or\nhybrid (slow/fast).\nThe type I fibers were positive for the F-8 and BF-35 antibodies.\nThe\ntype Ha fibers were positive for all of the antibodies\nexcept the F-8 antibody which is\nspecific for the slow MHC. The hybrid fibers stained positively for all the antibodies\nand\npresumably\nexpressed\nboth type I and Ha MHCs.\nThe hybrid fibers stained dark at an acid\npH and intermediate\nto dark at an alkaline pH for myosin ATPase.\nHybrid fibers\ncomposed\nbetween 20 to 40% of the soleus muscle in the young control monkeys,\nbut,\nwere rarely found in the MG, TA or VL.\nBased on the immunohistochemical\nstaining three fiber types were found in the\nMG, TA and VL: types I, IIa and IIx. The type I and IIA fibers stained the same as in the\nSol. The classification\nof IIx was based on the negative staining of fibers for the BF-35\nmonoclonal\nantibody.\nThese fibers were also negative for BA-F8, positive for BF-13 and\nintermediate\nfor SC-7 t. tn the rat, the SC-71 antibody is specific for type tta fibers, tn the\nmonkey and humans (personnal\ncommunication,\nS. Schiaffino),\nhowever,\nthe IIx fibers\nstain intermediate\nfor SC-71.\nBased on these antibodies\nwe could not detect any type IIb\nfibers in the MG, TA or VL muscles.\nConsequently,\nit appears that mixed hindlimb\nmuscles of the monkey have few, if any, IIb fibers.\nThe lack of IIb MHC was confirmed\nby SDS-PAGE.\nIn the Sol there were two\nbands which migrated to a location on the gel similar to that found for type I and IIa MHCs\nin other species.\nIn the MG, TA and VL there were also only two bands which had\nmigrations\ntypical of type I and Ha MHCs.\nA band located where IIb MHC is typically\nfound was not observed\nin any of the samples.\nThe IIx MHC in other species migrates just\nbelow the IIa MHC band. Using the same procedure\nthat is used to separate the four bands\nin rats, the Ha and IIx MHCs could not be separated and appear to migrate together.\nIn response\nto microgravity,\nthere was a significant\nincrease in the percentage\nof\nfast MHC in the Sol, and no change in fiber type in the MG and TA (Table 3). In the Sol\nof monkey\n151 the percentage\nof type I, IIa and hybrid fibers was 54, 19 and 27 % in the\npreflight\nbiopsies and 44, 30, and 26 % after the flight. In the Sol of monkey 906, the\nshift in fiber type was primarily\nfrom type i to hybrid.\nThe percentage\nof type I, IIa and\nhybrid fibers was 51, 6 and 43% in the preflight biopsies and 29, 8 and 63% in the\npostflight\nbiopsies. There was no difference\nin the percentage\nof slow and fast MHC\nbetween the pre and postflight biopsies taken from the the Sol, MG and TA of the control\nmonkeys.\nIn the VL muscle there was an increase in the percentage\nof type IIx fibers after the\nflight.\nThe percentage\nof type I, IIa and IIx fibers in the VL of monkey\n151 was 11, 33\nand 56% prior to the flight and 0, 21 and 79% after the flight. The percentage\nof type I, Ha\n\nBODINE-FOWLER\n\n8\n\nand IIx fibers in the VL of monkey\n71% after the flight.\n\n906 was 7, 37 and 56% prior to the flight\n\nand 4, 25 and\n\nSDH ACTIVITY\nThe mean SDH activities of the pre and postflight biopsies from the Sol, MG, TA\nand VL of the flight and control monkeys are shown in Figure 6. Within an animal, the\nmean SDH activity was similar across muscles.\nThere was no obvious effect of\nmicrogravity\non the SDH activity of any of the muscles.\nFor example,\nalthough\nthe SDH\nactivity decreased\nin the MG and TA of both flight muscles, it also decreased\nin some of the\ncontrol animals.\nIn the Sol, the mean SDH activity decreased\nin monkey\n151 and increased\nin monkey 906 after the spaceflight.\nInterestingly,\nall of the control monkeys\nshowed a\ndecrease in SDH activity between the two biopsies, consequently,\nthe increase in 906 was\nunusual.\nThe relationship\nbetween SDH activity, fiber cross-sectional\narea and myosin type\nis illustrated\nfor the Sol (Fig 7), and MG (Fig. 8) of the two flight monkeys.\nIn the Sol, all\nthree fiber types (I, IIa, and hybrid) had similar SDH activites and fiber areas. In the MG\nand TA, the type I and IIa fibers had overlapping\nSDH activites and fiber areas and the type\nIIx fibers had a lower SDH activity and significantly\nlarger fiber areas than the type I and\nIIa fibers. The type I and IIa fibers in the MG and TA were generally smaller in size than\nthe type I and IIa fibers in the Sol. Interestingly,\nthe relationship\nbetween type I, IIa and\nIIx fibers in the MG and TA was very similar to the relationship\nseen between type I, Ha\nand IIb fibers in other species.\nThe decrease seen in the overall mean SDH activities in all\nof the muscles appears to have been due to a decrease in the activities\nof the type I and Ha\nfibers.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nBased on data collected\nin rats it is generally assumed that extensors\natrophy to a\ngreater extent than flexors in response\nto spaceflight\nor hindlimb suspension.\nConsequently,\nthe finding that fibers in the TA (a fast flexor) of the flight monkeys\natrophied,\nwhereas fibers in the Sol (a predominantly\nslow extensor)\nand MG (a fast\nextensor)\ngrew after a 14-day spaceflight\n(Cosmos 2044) and 12-day spaceflight\n(Cosmos\n2229) was unexpected.\nIn Cosmos 2044, the TA in both flight monkeys\nhad a 21%\ndecrease in fiber size, whereas the Sol and MG both had a 79% increase in fiber size. In\nCosmos 2229, the TA in both flight monkeys\nshowed significant\natrophy, whereas the Sol\nand MG showed slight growth in one monkey (906) and slight atrophy in the other monkey\n(151).\nThe reason for the differential\nresponse in the two flight monkeys\nin Cosmos 2229\nis unclear, but may relate to differences\nin the activity levels of the two flight monkeys\n(151\nand 906) while in space. During the 12-day flight (Cosmos 2229) monkey 906 was more\nactive than monkey 151 based on the number of times it performed\nits motor task. The\nmotor task that each animals was trained to perform was a sinusoidal\nlever movement\n(60\ndegrees of movement)\nperformed\nat a specific rate and amplitude against a torque which\nwas adjustable\ndepending\non the abilities of the monkey.\nThe monkey was cued to perform\nthe task at least once every day of the flight for a 20 rain period.\nEdgeerton\nand colleagues\n(see technical report of Edgerton)\nfound that the integrated EMG activity of the Sol and MG\nduring the 20 minutes periods of the motor task was as high or higher during the flight as\nduring pre and postflight\ntesting.\nFurther, the amount of activity recorded\nin the Sol and\n\nBODINE-FOWLER\n\n9\n\nMG during the20min sessions uringtheflight generallyexceeded total activity that\nd\nthe\noccurredduring 24hoursof continuous\nrecordings\nduringnormalcageactivity.\nAlthoughthemonkeys\nwerenot trainedto performa taskwith theirright legthey\noften placedtheirfoot on a fixedbarthatwaslocatedontheright sideof thechairnextto\nthemovablelever. Consequently, waspossiblethatthemonkeysperformed\nit\nperiodic\nloadedcontractions\nwith theextensors f theright ankle.
