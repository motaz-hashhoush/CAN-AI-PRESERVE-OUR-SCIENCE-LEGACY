The goal of our current\nproject is to develop a sensorimotor adaptability (SA) training program to facilitate rapid\nadaptation to novel gravitational environments. We have developed a unique training system\ncomprised of a treadmill placed on a motion-base facing a virtual visual scene that provides an\nunstable walking surface combined with incongruent visual flow designed to enhance\nsensorimotor adaptability. We have conducted a series of studies that have shown:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nTraining using a combination of modified visual flow and support surface motion during\ntreadmill walking enhances locomotor adaptability to a novel sensorimotor environment.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nTrained individuals become more proficient at performing multiple competing tasks\nwhile walking during adaptation to novel discordant sensorimotor conditions.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nTrained subjects can retain their increased level of adaptability over a six months period.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nSA training is effective in producing increased adaptability in a more complex overground ambulatory task on an obstacle course. This confirms that for a complex task like\nwalking, treadmill training contains enough of the critical features of overground walking\nto be an effective training modality.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThe structure of individual training sessions can be optimized to promote fast/strategic\nmotor learning. Training sessions that each contain short-duration exposures to multiple\nperturbation stimuli allows subjects to acquire a greater ability to rapidly reorganize\nappropriate response strategies when encountering a novel sensory environment.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nIndividual sensory biases (i.e. increased visual dependency) can predict adaptive\nresponses to novel sensory environments suggesting that customized training\nprescriptions can be developed to enhance adaptability.\n\nThese results indicate that SA training techniques can be added to existing treadmill exercise\nequipment and procedures to produce a single integrated countermeasure system to improve\nperformance of astro/cosmonauts during prolonged exploratory space missions.\nThis work was supported by the National Space Biomedical Research Institute through NASA NCC 9-58\n\n'
