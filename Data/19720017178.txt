The resulting fan system cross-section is presented in the figure\non the next page.\nThe noise level objective was established at 92 PNdB, which would\npermit attainment of a six engine aircraft noise level less than 100 PNdB\nwithout inlet treatment.\n\nBased on a comparison of noise levels for fan\n\nsystems having pressure ratios between 1.25 and 1.35, it was concluded that\nthe noise level objective could not be obtained without integration of stator\n\nlean with a heavily treated exhaust system.\n\nDuring the aerodynamic design\n\nstudies, it was determined that 15 degrees of stator lean could be employed\nthrough proper contouring of the exhaust splitter system.\n\nFor this condition,\n\nthe exhaust splitters are aerodynamically loaded in the radial direction and\naccomplish some downstream diffusion in order to distribute the aerodynamic\nloading between the stators and the exhaust flowpath.\n\nA double exit stator\n\nrow system with the two stators leaned in opposite directions, initially\nconsidered and shown to be aerodynamically feasible, was abandoned because\nof mechanical complexity.\n\nThe acoustic analysis of the selected configuration, including 15\ndegrees of stator lean and four exhaust splitters, showed an estimated overall\nnoise level of 94.0 PNdB for a single lift unit.\n\nThis level is 2.0 PNdB\n\nhigher than the objective; however, it is felt that with further system\noptimization in a detailed design study, a reduction of 1 to 2 PNdB could be\nachieved.\n\nThus, it is reasonable to assume that the 100 PNdB objective for a\n\n6 fan system V/STOL research aircraft could be achieved through the use of a\nmodest amount of installation treatment.\n\nThe mechanical design approach used in the LF467 is based on previous\nstudies of lift fan systems employing the three strut front frame and single\nbubble scroll arrangement.\n\nThe use of the three strut frame and modified\n\nscroll represents a significant weight, cost and complexity reduction at the\nsacrifice of a small amount of increased fan system overall thickness.\n\nThe\n\nthree strut front frame system also improves the installation flexibility by\nremoving the requirement that the major strut, be oriented relative to the\nlongitudinal axis of the aircraft.\nThe LF467 rotor and stator design is essentially the same as used\nin the LF460 and LF468 fan systems.\n\nThe rotor system incorporates 88 high\n\naspect ratio blades with two part-span shrouds.\n\nThe tip turbine employs four\n\nturbine buckets per carrier that are integrally attached to the tips of each\nof the 88 fan blades.\n\nConventional grease-packed bearings are used to support\n\nthe twin-web disk arrangement.\nThe rear frame incorporates fifty-four titanium stator vanes with 15\ndegrees of lean in the direction of rotation.\n\nThe outer panel stators are leaned\n\n30 degrees against rotation to allow for relative thermal growth of the rear\nframe outer casings.\nsystem.\n\nFour acoustic splitters are included in the rear frame\n\nEach splitter is one inch thick and incorporates a corrugated core\n\nthus providing a two sided single degree of freedom noise suppression system.\nThe LF467 reference size lift fan is sized to operate using the\nexhaust gases of the YJ97-GE-100 engine on a sea level static standard day.\nDesign point or maximum control operation is achieved by flow transfer between\ntwo interconnected engine systems.\n\nThe maximum control gas conditions are\n\nestablished by the engine operating limitation of 2060 degrees Rankine exhaust\ngas temperature and the balanced flow transfer level.\n\nNominal operation is\n\nestablished for the no flow transfer case and engine operation at the rated\n1835 degrees Rankine exhaust gas temperature.\n\nStatic performance of the LF467\n\nfan at the two operating points at the standard day conditions are as follows:\n\nNominal\nRating*\n\nMaximum\nControl\n\nYJ97-GE-100 EOT, \xc2\xb0 R\n\n1835\n\n2053\n\nFan Airflow, Ib/sec\n\n702\n\n773\n\nFan Pressure Ratio**\n\n1.216\n\n1.266\n\nFan Speed, percent\n\n92.0\n\n100.0\n\nTurbine Inlet Pressure, psia\n\n46.1\n\n53.1\n\nGas Generator Airflow, pounds per second\n\n69.1\n\n75.4\n\nGas Generator Speed, percent\n\n101.5\n\n101.5 .\n\nNet, Ibs\n\n12885\n\n15692\n\nOne phase of this design study was to determine the effects of\nambient temperature on YJ97 exhaust gas conditions during the maximum power\ntransfer method of operation.

been conducting a program in conjunction with the NASA to define an advanced lift fan system which would\nsatisfy the requirements of a V/STOL transport research aircraft.\n\nStarting\n\nin late 1969, major effort was placed on the LF460 lift fan detail design,\nwhich was completed in May, 1971.\nThe LF460 is a 1.37 pressure ratio lift unit sized for use with the\nYJ97-GE-100 turbojet as the gas generator.\n\nEmphasis was placed on achieving\n\nlow fan noise while maintaining the high thrust/weight capability of a high\npressure ratio lift fan system.\nIn August, 1970, a NASA-sponsored study was initiated to define\nRemote Lift Fan Systems suitable for commercial applications in the 1980 time\nperiod.\n\nThis study involved cycle and configuration screening followed by\n\ncomponent and layout design activity through the preliminary design stage for\nthe selected systems.\n\nProvision was included in this study for the projected\n\nachievement of greatly reduced noise levels.\n\nTo achieve these low noise ob-\n\njectives, lift unit pressure ratios of 1.25 and 1.20 were selected for the\nfinal designs.\nConsidering the trends shown in the Remote study, the decision was\nmade to investigate the alternative of a lower pressure ratio lift fan for the\nresearch aircraft application to achieve reduced aircraft noise.\n\nA concept\n\ndefinition study was conducted under contract to NASA Lewis to investigate a\ndesign based on a 1.25 fan pressure ratio.\n\nDefinition of this study fan,\n\ndesignated the LF468, is documented in Reference 3.\n\nThe LF468 utilized the\n\nLF460 fan as a base but incorporated a single bubble scroll.\n\nWhere applicable,\n\nthe design included those noise suppression features identified in the Remote\nFan Lift Program which can be used to advantage in the earlier time period.\n\nIn November, 1971, the conceptual design studies of low noise lift\nfans were extended to include a design based on a 1.30 fan pressure ratio.\nDefinition of this study fan, designated the LF467, is documented in this\nreport.\n\nThe LF467 lift fan incorporates all of the desirable design features\n\nidentified during both studies of the Remote Lift Fan Program and the LF468\ndesign studies.\n\nIn addition, the design includes fan exit stator lean and\n\nadditional exhaust acoustic suppression to achieve overall noise levels consistent with the requirements for the V/STOL transport research aircraft.\nThe desire to investigate this higher pressure lift fan system is based on\nthe results of aircraft systems studies which indicated large weight and performance penalties associated with the lower pressure ratio designs.\n\nSECTION III\nDESIGN REQUIREMENTS\n\nThe LF467 lift fan system is designed to meet the anticipated requirements of a typical V/STOL research transport aircraft.\n\nThe design requirements\n\nare defined taking into consideration a typical research mission which includes\nthree cycles of vertical take-off, conventional cruise and vertical landing.\nThe total mission, as shown schematically in Figure 1, represents an operating\ntime of 33 minutes per event.\n\nThe duty cycle representation applied to the\n\ndesign takes into consideration the appropriate system power settings and\nanticipated power changes for maneuvering control throughout this type of\nmission.\nThe limiting components in the LF467 lift fan system are the hot\nrotating and static parts such as the buckets and scroll.\n\nThese components\n\nare designed for an ultimate life of 1200 hours; thus, the system has the\ncapability of performing about 2000 of the typical missions as defined.\nThis number of missions should adequately meet the requirements for the total\nV/STOL research program.\nA detailed description of the analysis methods and assumptions used\nin applying this mission analysis to the component design duty cycle is given\nin the LF460 design description, Reference 1.\nDesign Point Selection\nThe LF467 was designed to operate at a 1.30 fan stage pressure ratio.\nThis definition is based on the pressure ratio from the fan rotor inlet plane\nto the stator exit plane, exclusive of the losses associated with the exhaust\nacoustic splitter system.\n\nThe overall fan or nozzle pressure ratio reflects\n\nthe losses associated with the acoustic splitter skin friction; splitter and\nstator vane row interaction losses ; and fan inlet bellmouth, bulletnose and\nstrut friction losses.\n\nFor the LF467 design, the fan nozzle pressure ratio\n\nis 1.266 relative to ambient static pressure.\n\nOther design considerations included in the LF467 system are:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nTurbine exit velocity equal to or less than 1.10 times the fan jet velocity\nto assure a low level of turbine nozzle jet noise.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nMinimum fan tip speed consistent with established rotor loading criteria\nin order to achieve reasonable fan response to transient thrust changes.\nThese design considerations led to the selection of a fan tip speed\n\nof 1060 feet per second with a fan radius ratio equal to 0.454 for consistent\ndesign technology employed in the previous LF460 and LF468 lift fan designs.\nAs an initial part of the LF467 design cycle, the gas conditions\navailable for operating the fan at the design point were evaluated.\n\nDesign\n\npoint operation of the LF467 lift unit can only be achieved by transfer of\nflow between a pair of YJ97 gas generators.\n\nThese gas conditions were pre-\n\nviously determined for an ideal, no loss interconnect duct system.\n\nFor this\n\nstudy, the design point gas conditions were determined using the off-design\ncomputer deck developed during the LF460 study program.\n\nThis off-design\n\nanalysis includes a representative interconnect ducting system with losses\nand provides for balanced flow transfer gas conditions between the two interconnected YJ97 gas generators.\nin Figure 2.\n\nThe ducting arrangement is shown schematically\n\nFor this arrangement, the performance of the ducting components\n\nwas estimated as follows:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nEngine diffuser loss coefficient (Station 5.1 to 5.11)\n\n0.15\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nLosses associated with bleed-out flow (Station 5.11 to 5.12)\n\nFigure 3\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nInterconnect duct total pressure loss coefficient (Station\n\n1.4\n\n5.12 to 5.15)\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nLosses associated with bleed-in flow (Station 5.12 to 5.IIP)\n\nFigure 4\n\nTransition duct pressure loss including wide open valve\n\n0.967\n\n(Station 5.13 to 5.3)\n\nDuring flow transfer for control to achieve design gas conditions,\nthe throttle valves at the inlet to .one of the lift units are partially closed\ndown.\n\nThis increased back-pressure on the engine produces an increase in both\n\nengine exhaust gas pressure and temperature.\nthe high and low pressure engine duct systems.\n\nFlow transfer then occurs between\nThis added flow to the un-\n\nthrottled engine then back-pressures that engine until an equilibrium condition\nis achieved.\n\nThe gas energy of both engines are now at an increased level with\n\nthis higher energy flow

maximum power or flow transfer conditions were determined for a\nsystem which included two YJ97 gas generators as defined.\n\nA range of ambient\n\ntemperature conditions was used to investigate this design criteria on fan\nsizing and performance.\n\nFor each ambient temperature level, the fan turbine\n\nnozzle area was sized for rated engine exhaust gas temperature of 1835 degrees\nRankine with the assumed installation parameters given in Table I.\n\nThe engine\n\ndischarge conditions as shown in Figures 5 through 9 were then obtained for the\nmaximum flow transfer conditions.\n\nThe engine discharge flow conditions, with\n\nmodifications for flow transfer and ducting pressure loss produce the fan\nturbine inlet gas conditions as shown in Figures 10 through 12.\n\nThese gas\n\nconditions then provide the basis for evaluating the effects of ambient temperature on a 1.30 design pressure ratio lift fan system.\nThe results of this lift fan design parametric study are presented\nin Figures 13 through 16.\n\nThe effects of design temperature on the fan rotor\n\nsize is shown in Figure 13.\n\nFigures 14 through 16 present fan performance for\n\nthe three operating

standard day temperature where the fan tip diameter was established as 66.8 inches, thus this family of lift units incorporating a fan\npressure ratio of 1.30 are identified as the LF467.\nDesign Point Summary\nThe base or reference size lift unit is established as the LF467.\nThis size lift unit represents a sea level standard day designed system\noperating on the gas flow from a pair of YJ97 gas generators with about 8.8\npercent flow transfer and a limiting exhaust gas temperature of 2060 degrees\nRankine.\n\nThe corresponding temperature on the engine receiving the transfer\n\nflow and feeding directly to the lift fan operating at design point conditions\nis about 2052 degrees Rankine.\nexhaust gases.\n\nThe fan unit is designed to accept these engine\n\nThe significant fan and turbine design parameters for the\n\nLF467 lift fan are given in Tables II and III.\n\n10\n\nSECTION IV\nACOUSTIC DESIGN AND ANALYSIS\n\nDesign of a family of low noise lift fan systems was initiated with\nthe LF460, a 1.37 fan pressure ratio system.\n\nAcoustic analysis of this system,\n\nwhich included only modest levels of exhaust acoustic suppression, showed the\n500 foot sideline noise level to be 97.3 PNdB at the noise rating or nominal\nthrust condition.\n\nThe noise level for six fans would be 105.3 PNdB.\n\nThis\n\nlevel of noise generation, when corrected for estimated system installation\ntreatment level, would yield an overall noise level of 100 to 103 PNdB for a\ntypical six fan research transport aircraft.\nThe requirement to achieve a maximum noise level of less than 100\nPNdB, with a possibility of achieving a 95 PNdB level, led to the design of\na family of lower pressure ratio lift fan systems.\n\nThe initial lift fan system\n\ndesign which included extensive exhaust acoustic suppression was the LF468, a\n1.25 fan pressure ratio unit.\n\nThe results of this design study showed a six\n\nfan research aircraft to have an estimated 500 foot sideline noise level of\n101.3 PNdB without additional aircraft installation treatment.\n\nA level of\n\nless than 100 PNdB could be achieved with a modest amount of fan inlet treatment.\n\nFan exit stator lean was not included in this initial highly suppressed\n\nfan design because of difficulties in achieving acceptable stator aerodynamic\nloading.\n\nLater modifications of the aerodynamic design of fans with highly\n\nsuppressed exhaust systems1indicated that it is possible to have both lean\nand high levels of exhaust suppression.\n\nThis encouraging result led to the\n\nconclusion that a higher pressure ratio lift fan might meet the objective\nnoise level of 100 PNdB for a six fan research transport.\nThis design study was then extended to include a lift fan system\ndesigned to develop a 1.30 fan pressure ratio.\n\nThe higher pressure ratio\n\nlevels are desired for consideration of the aircraft installation and systems\ncompatibility viewpoint.\n\nThis lift fan system was designated the LF467, and\n\n11\n\nhas a fan tip diameter of about 66.8 inches and is designed to include extensive\nexhaust system suppression, adequate rotor stator spacing, and fan exit stator\nlean as desired for minimum noise generation.\n\nJet Noise\nThe two sources of jet noise which are inherent to the lift fan unit\nare the fan jet exhaust and the tip turbine exhaust.\n\nThe fan exhaust jet noise\n\nis primarily a function of the fan jet velocity which is established by the fan\npressure ratio and corresponding temperature rise.\n\nThese parameters are depen-\n\ndent upon the fan design selected and, as such, are not variables which may be\nused to reduce noise.\n\nWith the fan jet noise established, the turbine jet\n\nnoise was set at a lower level through proper selection of the turbine exit\nvelocity.\n\nThe resulting contribution of turbine jet noise to the total jet\n\nnoise floor was about one PNdB.\n\nThe turbine exit velocity was set at the desired\n\nlevel without major compromises in the turbine rotor design by incorporating an\nexit diffuser in the turbine exhaust stream.\nTurbine Noise\nPuretone and broadband noise generated by the tip turbine blades are\nestablished by the turbine tip speed and blade number.\n\nBoth of these variables\n\nwere selected on the basis of aerodynamic and mechanical design considerations.\nThe noise level of the turbine blading that resulted was not a major noise\nsource and was on the order of the fan jet noise floor; thus, no attempt was\nmade to add acoustic treatment to the turbine exhaust, or to modify the basic\ndesign.\n\nThis noise source does produce an increase of the total floor noise\n\n(i.e., all noise except that generated by the fan blades) on the order of\nthree PNdB.\nFan Noise\nThe major noise source for the LF467 lift fan is the puretone and\nbroadband noise generated by the fan stage.\n\nIn order to minimize the noise\n\ngenerated by the fan due to interaction of the rotor blade wakes and outlet\n\n12\n\nguide vanes, three specific acoustic features are incorporated into the design:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nHigh number of rotor blades ( 8 - A high number of rotor blades is used\n8)\nto insure that the passing frequency is well beyond the 2828 to 4480\nHertz bandwidth most heavily weighted for PNdB calculations and also\ntakes advantage of the higher atmospheric and ground attenuation levels\navailable at the higher frequencies.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nLarge axial spacing between the rotor and stator vanes - An axial spacing\nequal to two rotor chords was maintained to reduce the strength of the\nrotor wake before interaction occurs with the stators.\n\nThe short chord,\n\nmoderate solidity rotor blades aid this design feature since the physical\nspacing for two chord lengths is minimized.\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nCircumferential stator lean - The stator row is leaned circumferentially\nin the direction of the rotor rotation at an angle of 15 degrees to the\nhub.\n\nBy circumferentially leaning the exit stators the rotor wake becomes\n\noblique to the vane, thus producing a slicing type interaction as opposed\nto a more uniform or radial simultaneous interaction.\n\nThe tip portion of\n\nthe blade is leaned opposite to rotation by 30 degrees for mechanical\ndesign reasons.\n\nThis helps in producing a slicing action between the wake\n\nand OGV but the effectiveness is not as large as leaning in the direction\nof rotation.\nAcoustic Treatment\nNoise suppression by means of acoustically treated splitters is obtained most effectively by maintaining the height of the passage through which\nthe noise is propagating at a value approximately equal to the wave length of\nthe treatment design frequency.\nof 4 0 Hertz was selected.\n00\n\nFor the LF467 spectrum shape a design frequency\n\nMaximum suppression will occur at this frequency\n\nwith decreasing levels at lower and higher frequencies.\n\nThe extent to which\n\nthe lower and higher frequencies are suppressed establishes the suppression\nbandwidth.\n\nFor the selected design frequency, it is necessary to use four\n\n13\n\nacoustic splitters in the fan exhaust duct to provide the required passage\nheight.\n\nThe combination of passage height and the requirement to maintain a\n\nwide suppression band resulted in selection of a one inch splitter thickness.\nThe inner and outer walls of the flowpath are also acoustically treated. The\nlength of the acoustic splitters is defined by the ratio of length to passage\nheight ( / )\nLH.\n\nFor the LF467, a ratio of four was assumed for the basic con-\n\nceptual design.\nAn additional three PNdB suppression is assumed to be available by\napplying acoustic treatment to the exit louvers.\n\nThis assumption was based\n\non the treatment tests and louver arrangements developed for the LF460 lift\nfan reported in Reference 1.\nEstimated Noise Levels\nLF467 noise levels were estimated using the prediction technique\nand assumptions used for the LF460 and LF468 lift fan systems, References 1\nand 3. Reference 1 describes the prediction method.\nTable IV presents the estimated noise levels for the LF467 at the\nNoise Rating Point.\n\nTotal noise for the lift unit is 94 PNdB which is two\n\nPNdB higher than the objective level of 92 PNdB required to satisfy the aircraft\nobjective noise levels.\n\nA comparison of the suppressed fan noise of 92.5 PNdB\n\nand the total noise of 94.0 PNdB shows only a 1.5 PNdB influence due to the jet\nnoise and turbine noise floor.\nOne of the most important factors in the overall noise level is the\ninlet radiated fan noise seen in the aft quadrant.\n\nFor the estimates presented,\n\nit was assumed that the inlet level was 10 PNdB lower than the exhaust radiated\nnoise in the aft quadrant.\n\nAs seen in Table IV, even though the exhaust treat-\n\nment is reducing the aft generated noise by 20.7 PNdB the overall effect is only\na reduction of 9.7 PNdB.\n\nSince this assumption of 10 difference between inlet\n\nand exhaust radiated noise is such a significant factor, the LF467 noise was\nalso calculated with the assumption that the inlet radiated noise is completely\nremoved.\n\n14\n\nThese values are also shown.\n\nThis would represent the lowest noise\n\nattainable by the LF467 as currently designed.\n\nThe impact of the inlet noise\n\nis obvious since the noise level is only 86 PNdB with it removed, which is\nbelow the value ( 7 0 PNdB) required to obtain An overall\n8.\nof 95 PNdB for a six fan aircraft.\n\n15\n\nSECTION V\nAERODYNAMIC DESIGN\n\nInitial Studies\nPrevious fan aerodynamic design studies, the LF468 and advanced\nremote lift fan, have shown that it is difficult to incorporate both exit\nstator lean and extensive exhaust treatment into the system design.\n\nThe\n\nbasic aerodynamic problem associated with stator lean is that with the\nstator vanes leaned in the direction of rotation, a radially outward flow\ncomponent must be accounted for in the inner and hub flowpath.\n\nWhen exten-\n\nsive exhaust treatment is included, the blockage associated with the splitter\nthickness tends to require a radially inward sloping flowpath. Attempts\nto satisfy both of these criteria were unsuccessful in the previous design\nstudies.\n\nThe usual problem was excessive stator vane loadings in the vicinity\n\nof the hub.\n\nDuring the initial design phases of this study, it was apparent\nthat the 1.30 pressure ratio fan must include stator lean in order to have\na reasonable overall noise level.\n\nTwo basic approaches were considered to\n\nincorporate lean:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nA double stator row with the first row leaned in the direction of rotation\nand the second row leaned opposite to rotation.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nA single stator row leaned in the direction of rotation with aerodynamically\nloaded acoustic splitter systems.\n\nThe annular flowpaths near the hub act\n\nas diffusers and tend to unload the stator vanes in the hub area.\nThe double stator row configuration was carried through the aerodynamic\ndesign phase and was shown to be feasible.\n\nThe configuration was not carried\n\nthrough the mechanical design sequence because of the high mechanical complexity\nassociated with this scheme.\n\nThe results of the aerodynamic study will be pre-\n\nsented to document the design characteristics of this type of lift fan stator\ndesign.\n\n16\n\nThe aerodynamic design studies of the loaded splitter configuration\nalso showed that a stator system with 15 degrees of lean was feasible without\nunnecessarily high aerodynamic risk.\n\nIn addition, this single stator row design\n\noffers about two additional inches of acoustic treatment over the two stator\ndesign for the same total fan thickness.\n\nOn this basis, and because of the con-\n\nsiderable design experience that is available for the conventional highly\ntreated stator configuration, the loaded splitter configuration was selected\nfor this design phase of the LF467 lift fan.\nDouble Stator Configuration\nThe double leaned stator configuration incorporates two vane rows\nclosely spaced together.\n\nThe forward vane row was leaned 15 degrees in the\n\ndirection of rotation based on the reduced noise levels inherent with lean in\nthis direction.\n\nThe second vane row was leaned in the opposite direction.\n\nFor this configuration, the first vane row turns the flow radially outward\nbecause of the direction of lean.\n\nThe second downstream vane row then turns\n\nthe flow radially inward thus tending to correct the radial outward flow\nproblem of the leaned stator and at the same time meet the acoustic lean\ncriteria.\n\nBoth stator rows include 30 degrees of outer panel lean opposite to\n\nrotation as required to satisfy the mechanical design considerations.\nThe flowpath developed for this configuration is shown in Figure 18.\nThe details of the aerodynamic design procedures are described in Reference 1.\nThe significant aerodynamic parameters are presented for reference purposes\nin Figures 19 through 23, as follows:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nFan exit total and static pressure profiles\n\nFigure

distribution\n\nFigure 22\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nStator aerodynamic loading parameters\n\nFigure 23\n\n17\n\nSelected Fan Configuration\nThe fan design configuration selected for continuation into the\nmechanical design effort was the 15 degree leaned stator system incorporating\nthe four aerodynamically loaded splitters.\n\nThe basic aerodynamic procedures\n\ndefined in Reference 1 were used for this design, resulting in the aerodynamic\nflowpath shown in Figure 24.\n\nThis design configuration incorporates the\n\ndesirable 15 degrees of stator lean in the direction of rotation with a\nreversed 30 degrees of lean between the outer splitter and the stator tip.\nComparison of the double stator configuration, Figure 18, and the final LF467\nconfiguration, Figure 24, shows that an additional two inches of exhaust\ntreatment is included in the design for the same overall fan depth.\nFan Description\nThe significant design parameters which describe the LF467 fan are\npresented in Table II.\nof 1.30.\n\nThe fan was designed for a nominal total pressure ratio\n\nThe actual overall pressure ratio from ambient to fan discharge is\n\n1.266 because of the pressure loss associated with the inlet and the four\nacoustic splitter panels in the exit.\n\nSelection of tip diameter, hub radius\n\nratio, airflow and tip speed were discussed previously, under Design Requirements and Design Point Selection.\nThe desirable features included in this design are as follows:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThe inlet bellmouth and bulletnose heights have been increased to accommodate the single bubble scroll and modified front frame.\n\nThese features\n\nare desired for overall system simplicity and reduced component weight.\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThe aerodynamic design tip speed was selected as 1060 feet per second\nconsistent with the aerodynamic loading levels at a 1.30 fan pressure\nratio.\n\nA minimum tip speed consistent with reasonable aerodynamic loading\n\nis required for rapid response of the lift unit to thrust changes.\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThe stator and exhaust system includes stators leaned 15 degrees in the\ndirection of rotation with four acoustically treated exhaust splitters.\nThese items were included to reduce overall fan system noise levels.\n\n18\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThe rotor to stator spacing is two times the rotor tip chord.\n\nThis level\n\nof spacing is required to reduce rotor-vane interaction contribution to\nthe overall noise levels.\n\nIncreased rotor-vane spacing above the two\n\nlevel is usually not warranted based on the additional noise reductions.\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nAerodynamic loading both upstream and downstream of the stator vane row\nand additional downstream diffusion is included in the exhaust splitter\nsystem so that the stator lean could be incorporated into the design,\neven with the large blockage due to the four one inch thick exhaust\nsplitters.\nAerodynamic Design Details\nThe flowpath of the LF467 system as developed during this conceptual\n\ndesign study is shown in Figure 24.\n\nThe fan aerodynamic design parameters\n\nobtained during the design study are presented in Figures 25 through 34.\nThese characteristics represent the results of only an initial conceptual\ndesign study. An optimization and smoothing of the parameters would undoubtedly occur during a final design analysis.\nThe significant fan aerodynamic parameters for the LF467 configuration with stator lean, as presented in the figures, are as follows:\nWall Mach number distributions\n\nFigure 25\n\nRotor and stator exit total pressure profiles\nI\nRotor and stator pressure loss coefficients\n\nFigure 26\nFigure 27\n\nRotor and stator inlet velocity distribution\n\nFigures 28 and 29\n\nRotor and stator air and blade angles\n\nFigures 30 and 31\n\nRotor aerodynamic loading parameters\n\nFigure 32\n\nStator aerodynamic loading parameters\n\nFigure 33\n\nRotor and stator choke ratios\n\nFigure 34\n\n19\n\nIn Figure 35 is presented the radial location of the stream function\nparameter throughout the fan rotor and stator consistent with the aerodynamic\nperformance parameters previously presented.\nFan Blade and Vane Geometry\nBased on the aerodynamic design parameters previously presented,\nthe blade geometries selected for the LF467 fan design are summarized in\nFigures 36 through 39.\nin Figure 36.\n\nThe variation of rotor and stator solidities are shown\n\nThese solidity levels were selected to provide adequate stall\n\nand choke margins with additional consideration based on mechanical requirements.\nIn Figure 37 is shown a plot of rotor blade meanline arc length\nratio and meanline arc radius ratio versus radius.\n\nAt the hub, arc length\n\nratio was set at a 0.5 level. At the tip, the arc length ratio was selected\nto keep the junction of the meanline arcs downstream of the blade throat.\n\nAn\n\napproximately linear variation was then used from hub to tip. The arc radius\nratio was varied from hub to tip in a manner to provide the proper local and\nrotor average choke margins.\nThe LF467 rotor blade geometry is summarized in Figure 38.\n\nThe\n\nsudden increase in chord and maximum thickness-to-chord ratio near the tip is\nthe result of mechanical requirements for attachment of the tip turbine bucket\ncarriers.\n\nThe waviness of the camber and stagger curves is due to the part-\n\nspan dampers.\nThe stator vane blade geometry employs circular arc airfoils.\nstator vane geometric parameters are shown in Figure 39.\n\nThe\n\nThe vanes incorporate\n\nconstant chord, maximum thickness and trailing edge thickness throughout the\nairfoil span.\n\nVariations of camber and stagger are due to the penetration of\n\nthe acoustic splitters through the blade row.\nThe radial variation of aerodynamic loading on the rotor blade and\nstator vane rows for the selected air design and blading geometry is shown in\n\n20\n\nFigures 40 and 41.\n\nThe discontinuities in the stator vane loading occurs at\n\neach of the acoustic splitter locations.\nTurbine Aerodynamic Design\nThe fan turbine system is designed to accept the exhaust gas conditions from the two interconnected YJ97 engine systems at the maximum power\ntransfer levels.\n\nThe reference size LF467 lift fan system is based on these\n\ngas conditions representative of sea level static operation on a standard day.\nThe significant turbine design point parameters are tabulated in Table III.\nThe turbine velocity diagrams at this design point are shown in Figure 42.\nThis turbine design is similar to those used in both the LF460 and\nLF468 lift fan designs in that the turbine bucket exit Mach number is selected\nas high as reasonable followed by downstream diffusion.\n\nThe high bucket Mach\n\nnumber which results in minimum bucket height, is desired to achieve minimum\ntime for response to a given change in thrust level.\n\nThe downstream diffusion\n\nis required to yield a turbine exit velocity almost equal to the fan exit\nvelocity in order to minimize the effects of the turbine jet noise on the\noverall jet noise.\n\nThe effects of these parameters, turbine exit Mach number\n\nand diffusion, were investigated during the LF468 design and are discussed in\nReference 4.\n\nBased on these trends, the bucket exit Mach number was selected\n\nto be 0.55 at the design point and a 1.30 area ratio diffuser was used downstream of the turbine bucket exit.\nAerodynamic Flowpath\nThe aerodynamic flowpath of the fan and turbine streams is shown in\nFigure 43. This flowpath includes a fan rotor with a 0.454 hub radius ratio\nand a 15 degree radial inward fan tip slope.\nalmost axial.\n\nThe fan flowpath at the hub is\n\nA rotor exit to stator inlet spacing of 2.0 times the rotor tip\n\nchord is used to minimize rotor-stator interaction noise.\n\nThe fan exhaust\n\nflowpath includes four one inch thick acoustic splitters.\n\nTwo of the splitters\n\nextend through the exit stator row and are used to guide the flow along the\ninnerstage hub and tip flowpaths.\n\n21\n\nSECTION\n\nVI\n\nMECHANICAL DESIGN\n\nFront Frame Design\n\nGeneral Description\n\nThe principle components of the front frame assembly shown in Figure\n44 are the struts, hub, dome and bellmouth.\n\nThe front frame is the main\n\nstructural support for the rotor, transferring all rotor loads, gyroscopic\nmoments and inertia forces through the scroll to the airframe mounts.\n\nThe\n\nfront frame incorporates a center hub for mounting the rotor bearings and\nthree structural struts oriented 120 degrees apart.\n\nThese struts restrict\n\nthe relative axial deflections between the rotor and adjacent structure.\nThe struts are pinned at the hub and scroll allowing the struts to follow\nradial movement of the scroll.\n\nDesign Requirements\n\nIn addition to the general design requirements discussed in Section III,\nthe following requirements are applicable to the front frame:\n\n1.\n\nProvide required stability to maintain adequate clearances and prevent\ninterference between static and rotating parts during all fan operating\nconditions.\n\n2.\n\nProvide a seal between the turbine and fan inlets to limit hot gas\nleakage into the fan stream.\n\nThe fan system is subjected to aerodynamic, maneuver and crossflow\nloading conditions.\n\nThe front frame is designed to transmit all rotor\n\nloads through the scroll to the airframe mounts.\n\n22\n\nAerodynamic Loading\n\nTine resultant static foiroes clwft to> \xc2\xbb\'<e.*v*3,je\xc2\xbba8ni\xc2\xab>\n\n*<f\n\n.j\n\nspeed are summarized in the following table:\n\nAxial Force\n(Pounds)\n\nComponent\n\nTorque\n(Inch- Pounds)\n\nBellmouth\n\n+5849\n\n0\n\nBulletnose\n\n-1331\n\n0\n\nStruts\n\n-20\n\n0\n\nRotor Hub\n\n+1158\n\n0\n\nRotor Blades .\n\n.\n\n+7541\n\n218,100\n\nTurbine Carriers and Buckets\n\n+124\n\n218,100\n\nStator Hub and Inner Wall\n\n+985\n\nFan Stators and Splitters\n\n41254\n\nStator Midbox and Outer Wall\n\n-120\n\n0\n\nScroll Nozzles\n\n+1945\n\n220,500*\n\n0\n218,100\n\nAir loads on the struts are due to aerodynamic drag only and are\nassumed negligible during hover operation.\n\nManeuver Loads\n\nThe front frame and mounts are designed to withstand maneuver loads\nas defined in Reference 1, when applied simultaneously with the aerodynamic\nloading.\n\nManeuver loads can be applied during conventional flight or in a\n\ncrossf low environment .\n\nCrossflow Conditions\n\nThe front frame is designed to withstand aerodynamic loads experienced\nduring transitional flight when installed with a shallow wing fan inlet.\n\n* Turbine Residual Swirl = 2400 inch-pounds In direction of rotation\n\n23\n\nThe design point for crossflow operation is 100 percent fan speed at a flight\nspeed of 150 knots.\nComponent Design Description\nHub\n\nThe hub provides a load-carrying structure to transfer rotor loads to\nthe three struts. A flange stiffened structure is utilized to limit radial\ndeflections. The hub is fabricated from a machined titanium 6-4 forging.\nThree gussets are located between the two flanges, positioned in line with\nthe strut attachment lugs.\n\nLugs on each flange, drilled and bushed for\n\nbody-bound bolts, provide attachment points for the struts. The aft flange\nis drilled to accept bolts to fasten the bearing outer race retainer to the\nhub.\n\nThe dome is bolted to the forward flange.\nStruts\nThree equally-spaced struts provide the loadpath which transfers the\n\nfan thrust, crossflow, gyroscopic and inertia loads to the scroll mounts.\nThe struts are structural spars utilizing top and bottom cap strips supported\nby a continuous shear web, resembling an I-beam with a constant chord of\n9.0 inches. Both the top and bottom cap strips transition from an airfoil\ncontour through the fan flow area into machined lugs for fastening to the\nhub. The lugs are boxed-in on the sides to reduce load-induced deflection.\nThe struts are NACA 63-618 series airfoils.\n\nA honeycomb filler is\n\nlocated between cap strips on each side of the web to form the required\nairfoil contour.\n\nThe honeycomb is adhesive-bonded to the web and the 0.010\n\ninch aluminum face sheets.\n\nHoneycomb filler is also used between face sheets\n\nto form part of the airfoil under the bottom cap strip.\nA uniball attachment is used at the outboard end of each strut. This\nprevents induced bending moments in the strut when loads are transmitted\n\n24\n\nto the scroll mount.\n\nBellmouth\n\nThe bellmouth provides the aerodynamic outer flowpath of the fan inlet.\nIt incorporates the forward air seal assembly.\n\nThe bellmouth is mounted to\n\nthe scroll with 36 "A" frame brackets and is fabricated in two sections to\nallow assembly of the brackets to the scroll.\n\nThe bellmouth is a continuous 360 degree titanium 6-4 honeycomb\nstructure.\n\nIt utilizes 0.010 inch face sheets resistance-welded to 0.0035\n\ninch foil forming a 0.5 inch thick panel.\n\nThe honeycomb has 0.25 inch cells.\n\nAt the outer diameter, the bellmouth is crushed to a reduced thickness\nto provide a recession for the airframe installation cover.\n\nAnchor nuts\n\nare provided on the underside for mounting the installation cover.\n\nA machined flange is located at the aft end of the bellmouth to provide\nmounting for the forward air seal assembly.\n\nThe seal assembly ring is\n\nfabricated from two 0.020 inch titanium 6-4 face sheets separated by a\nbrazed corrugated strip to dissipate heat.\n\nA 0.25 inch thick insulation\n\nblanket is attached on the scroll side of the bellmouth to limit soak-back\ntemperatures at shutdown.\n\nAt the three locations where the scroll mount brackets penetrate\nthrough the bellmouth, the honeycomb is crushed to provide a flange for\nsix anchor nuts riveted to the back side.\n\nThese are used to mount a seal\n\naround each scroll mount bracket.\n\nDome\n\nThe dome provides the required aerodynamic contour over the hub region\nof the front frame.\n\nThe dome has cutouts at each strut location to allow\n\nunrestricted strut motion during fan operation.\n\nThe dome is formed from\n\n25\n\n0.25 inch thick aluminum 7075 T6 honeycomb sandwich with 0.010 inch face\nsheets bonded to an internal load-carrying network of ribs.\n\nThe ribs carry\n\nthe loads from an aluminum "u" channel at the lower end of the dome to the\nsix mount points at the upper mounting flange.\n\nThe flange has six 1 inch\n\ntubes open at their upper end and blanked-off and drilled at the lower end\nfor attachment to the hub.\n\nForward Air Seal Assembly\n\nThe forward air seal assembly is attached to the aft inner surface of\nthe bellmouth.\n\nThis seal assembly, shown in Figure 45, restricts the hot\n\ngas leakage from the turbine inlet into the fan stream.\n\nA slip seal controls\n\nleakage from the fan cavity, between the bellmouth and scroll, into the\nturbine rotor inlet.\n\nThe forward air seal has thirty 12 degree segments.\n\nEach segment has\n\na 0.030 inch backing plate with each end machined to provide a 0.25 inch\noverlap from segment to segment.\n\nThe seal surface is a strip of honeycomb\n\n0.2 inch thick by 0.5 inch wide, which is brazed to the backing plate.\nhoneycomb utilizes 0.0625 inch cell size and 0.0025 inch foil.\n\nThe\n\nThe

vented through the wiggle strip.\n\nCooling\n\nA flange on the forward end bolts\n\nto the aft end of the bellmouth.\n\nThe bellmouth-to-scroll slip seal is also assembled from 12 degree\nsegments.\n\nEach segment consists of two laminated 0.010 inch sheets offset\n\nto form an overlap at each end, thus providing an "interlock" between segments.\n\nThe slip seal is bolted to the seal assembly ring with the insulation\n\nsandwiched between.\n\nThe air deflector consists of six 60 degree segments.\n\n26\n\nEach segment is\n\nbolted between the seal assembly and the bellmouth.\n\nThe air deflector directs\n\nthe hot gas leakage rearward to minimize effects on the incoming fan air stream.\nDesign Stress Levels\nIn Figure 46 is presented the major component design stresses for the lift fan\nfront frame.\n\nStress levels shown are the maximum which are predicted to occur\n\nunder combined steady state, cross-flow and maneuver conditions.\nScroll Design\ni\nGeneral Description\nThe turbine scroll distributes the engine exhaust gases through two\n180 degree arms to feed the turbine nozzle annulus.\n\nThe gas leaves the\n\nscroll through the nozzle partitions at a constant exit angle to drive the\ntip turbine.\nutilized.\n\nTo minimize weight, a simple single bubble scroll is\n\nThe scroll provides a loadpath to transfer front frame and bell-\n\nmouth loads to the airframe mounts.\n\nThe scroll is fabricated from Rene" 41\n\nmaterial.\nDesign Requirements\nIn addition to the general design requirements discussed in Section III,\nthe following requirements apply specifically to the scroll:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nOperate under engine-out conditions (only one-half of scroll receiving\nhot gas flow) for a maximum of 4 minutes without adverse structural effect.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nTransfer all front frame loads to the airframe mounts.\nComponent Design Description\nAs shown in Figure 47, the scroll assembly incorporates the inlet elbows,\n\nbubble, nozzle partitions, a torque tube and exhaust section.\n\nAll sheet metal\n\nskins are stretch formed in right-hand and left-hand sections then masked and\nchem-milled .to minimum skin thickness after forming.\n\nThis provides thick weld\n\njoints and improved formability, while retaining the advantages of lightweight\nthin gauge design.\n\n27\n\nInlet Elbow\n\nTwo inlet elbows direct the inlet gas tangentially.\n\nThese elbows pro-\n\nvide a controlled area change to maintain a constant Mach number as the flow\nis turned and fed to the first section of nozzle partitions.\n\nThe elbows\n\nhave a flange at the inlet for bolting to the gas duct system.\n\nThey are\n\nfabricated from 0.060 inch material and chem-milled to 0.040 except where\nweld joints occur at the bubble, torque tube and scroll exhaust.\n\nA one inch\n\nthick honeycomb partition with 0.020 inch thick face sheets, separates the\ntwo inlets.\n\nIt provides the structural load path from the front frame\n\nstrut to the airframe mount beneath the scroll inlets.\n\nBubble\n\nThe bubble is fabricated from 0.060 inch material and chem-milled to\n0.020 except at the weld joints.\n\nThe cross-sectional area decreases to\n\nmaintain a flow Mach number of 0.35 as the gas is distributed to the first\n120 degree segment of the nozzle partitions.\n\nDiameter is constant from\n\nthere to the 180 degree point (opposite the inlets) where another partition\nacross the bubble separates the two halves of the scroll.\n\nTorque Tube\n\nThe torque tube provides a structural attachment and a contoured inlet\nflowpath for the nozzle partitions.\n\nLocally, at each airframe mount, it\n\nprovides a load path from the nozzle partitions into the bubble and into the\nairframe mounts.\n\nA short angled strip of 0.030 inch material is brazed\n\nwithin the torque tube and eloxed to accept the nozzle partition at the same\ntime as the exit outer flowpath.\n\nThe partitions are fitted within the eloxed\n\nslots and brazed.\n\nScroll Exhaust\n\nThe scroll exhaust consists of an inner and outer flowpath.\n\n28\n\nThe inner\n\nflowpath is machined with two radial stiffening rings and butt welded to the\nbubble.\n\nA strip of 0.030 inch material is brazed to the side forming a\n\ntorque box into which the nozzle partitions are brazed.\n\nThe torque box has\n\na three-leaf slip seal brazed at its lower end. The outer flowpath is a\nmachined component that has the forward end welded to the torque tube inlet\nand the bubble. A slip-fit slot is located at the aft end to mate with the\nrear frame.\n\nNozzle Partitions\n\nVariation of the gas flow angles inside the scroll requires three\ndifferent families of nozzle partitions to turn the gas and provide a\nconstant nozzle discharge angle.\n\nEach of the 178 nozzle partitions has a\n\n0.005 inch protuberance on the pressure side which establishes the throat\narea for the convergent-divergent supersonic nozzle design.\n\nThe nozzles are\n\ncast hollow, have a wall thickness of 0 0 0 inches and are twisted slightly\n.4\nbecause of the required canting relative to the buckets.\n\nThe canted posi-\n\ntion is necessary in order to carry the bubble membrane loads across the\npartitions.\n\nEach nozzle partition is brazed to the torque box at its inner\n\nend and to the torque tube at its outer end.\n\nScroll/Airframe Mounts\n\nThe three mounts, spaced 120 degrees apart, are machined brackets\nhaving a one inch diameter uniball for airframe mounting and a 0.375 inch\ndiameter uniball for attachment to the rear frame.\n\nThe mount between the\n\ninlets is welded to the honeycomb partition separating the two halves of\nthe scroll.\n\nAt the other two positions, the mounts are welded to the torque\n\ntube and a flanged ring (0.2511 x 2") around the bubble.\n\nThe flange provides\n\nthe principal load path between the strut mounts and the airframe mounts.\nThe front frame mount clevis is welded to the honeycomb partition at the\ninlets and bolted to the flanged ring at the 120 degree locations.\n\nA drag\n\nlink mount clevis welded to the torque tube is provided 180 degrees from\nthe scroll inlet.\n\nThis mount accepts one half of the fore and aft fan\n\ninertia loads and half of any residual scroll nozzle torque loads.\n\n29\n\nInsulation\nThe outer surface of the scroll is covered with 0.5 inch thick Min-K.\nThe insulation is contained in two 0.003 inch AMS 5510 foil skins.\nDesign Summary\nThe scroll design was based on the LF460 type duty cycle and analyzed as\na "Time and Cycle - Dependent Structure."\n\nThis analysis, presented in Reference\n\n1, is based on the assumption that a linear combination of creep damage and\nfatigue damage is valid for design purposes.\n\nPreliminary analysis indicates\n\nthat the maximum bubble stress occurs at the mount points.\n\nResults indicate\n\nthat the 1200 hour mission life requirement can be satisfied with the current\nscroll design.\n\nIn Figure 48 is shown the overall stress summary for the scroll.\n\nRotor Design\n\nGeneral Description\n\nThe LF467 rotor basic design approach is essentially the same as that\nused in the design of the UT468 lift fan. The rotor incorporates a single\nstage fan and a single stage tip turbine.\nratio blades.\n\nThe fan stage has 88 high aspect\n\nEach fan blade has two part-span shrouds to control blade\n\nvibrations and torsional flutter.\n\nTorque transmission is accomplished through\n\nthese part-span shrouds and a blade tip lockup.\n\nThe turbine consists of 88 sectors, each containing four shrouded\nbuckets.\n\nThe buckets have integral tip shrouds and incorporate improved\n\nFOD resistance features compared to previous fan turbines.\n\nThe turbine\n\nbucket carrier assemblies are integrally attached to the tip of each fan\nblade.\n\n30\n\nThe disk utilizes the twin web geometry proven by operation on previous\nlift fans.\n\nThe two-piece disk is electron beam welded at the rim and\n\nbrazed at the internal spacers.\n\nThe stub shaft is integral with the disk,,\n\nelmiminating the need for a mechanical joint.\n\nThe rotor is supported by two grease-packed bearings, one angularcontact thrust bearing and one pre-loaded roller bearing.\n\nThe roller\n\nbearing employs an out-of-round inner ring which loads the rollers to\nprevent skidding.\n\nThe bearings have inner race rotation similar to the LF1\n\nlift fan utilized in the XV-5 aircraft.\nto minimize power loss.\n\nSilverplated bronze cages are used\n\nVacuum melt M50 bearing material is used in the\n\nraces, rollers and balls to improve bearing fatigue life.\n\nThe sump is a\n\nself-contained removable subassembly allowing the rotor to be balanced on\nits own bearings prior to fan assembly.\n\nDynamics\n\nLift fan rotors exhibit dynamic characteristics similar to conventional\ngas turbine rotors, in that both are susceptible to coupled blade-disk\nvibrations.\n\nThe rotor dynamic requirement is that no detrimental vibratory\n\nmode of the coupled blade-disk be present in the fan operating speed range\nfrom 70 to 100 percent rpm.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThe design criteria are:\n\nThe coupled blade-disk two-wave vibratory mode should be at least 15\npercent higher in frequency that the 2/rev excitation at 100 percent\n\nrpm.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThe coupled blade-disk three-wave critical speed should be below 70\npercent rpm.\n\nThe results of the axial vibratory analyses are shown in Figure 49.\nThe two wave resonance satisfies the criteria with a margin of 15 percent.\nThe three-wave resonance occurs at 75 percent rpm, compared to an objective\nof 70 percent rpm.\n\nA reduction to the 70 percent level would not be desirable\n\n31\n\nsince any decrease in the three-wave critical rpm would also decrease the\n15.0 percent margin of the two-wave resonance.\n\nDesign and test experience\n\nhave shown that placement of the two-wave mode above the 2/rev excitation\nis more important than having the three-wave mode at the bottom of the\noperating range.\n\nThe LF336 has a three-wave resonance at 74 percent rpm,\n\nyet has experienced no blade stress build-up. The results obtained are,\ntherefore, considered completely acceptable.\n\nLow Cycle Fatigue Analysis\n\nAll rotor components were assumed to be subject to 12 start-stop cycles\nper hour.\n\nThe stress range for the low-cycle fatigue analysis was defined\n\nas the difference between the stresses at the 0 percent speed and the 104\npercent speed conditions.\n\nHalf of this stress range was considered to be\n\nmean stress and the other half was considered to be alternating stress, as\nillustrated in Figure 50.\n\nA stress concentration factor was applied to both\n\nalternating and mean stresses.\n\nIn Table V are summarized the results of the\n\nanalysis.\n\nLimiting Stress and Life\n\nA summary of limiting stresses for all major rotor components is also\ngiven in Table V.\n\nThis table lists the material^.design temperature, type\n\nof loading and criteria for limiting stress.\n\nComparisons are made between\n\nthe design\'limit stress and allowable stresses.\n\nMargins of

two part-span shrouds on the airfoil, and a single hook dovetail at the\nblade root for disk attachment.\nairfoils.\n\nThe fan blades are multiple circular arc\n\nThe inner fan flowpath is established by the integral platforms\n\non the blade root and the adjacent disk dovetail posts.\npath is defined by the fan blade tip shroud.\n\nThe outer fan flow-\n\nBlade rigidity for frequency\n\ncontrol and torque transmission is provided at the root by the dovetail,\nalong the airfoil by part-span shrouds near the 1/3 and 2/3-span points, and\nat the tip by the tip shroud.\n\nAxial blade retention is provided in\n\nthe forward direction by an integral hook on the dovetail aft face and in\nthe aft direction by a blade retainer ring.\n\nDesign Requirements\n\nThe blade has been designed to meet the life and cycle requirements\ndefined in Section III.\n\nThese requirements include:\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nMinimum life of 1200 hours.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nCapable of withstanding 1 , 0 start-stop cycles.\n440\n\nDesign Criteria\n\nThe blade design criteria are:\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nIn the fan operating range (70 to 100 percent rpm), there must be a\nmargin of at least 15 percent between any blade natural frequency and\nany excitation frequency from the front frame and stators.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nBlade flutter must not occur prior to fan stall.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nAll blade stresses must be less than:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n80 percent of ultimate tensile strength at 106 percent speed.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n0.2 percent minimum yield strength at 106 percent speed.\n\n33\n\n*\n\nMinimum rupture strength (Mission Analysis).\n\n*\n\n10\' cycles on the stress range diagram at 100 percent speed.\n\nDovetail\n\nThe blade root attachment to the disk is made using a straight, single\nhook dovetail with a 55 degree flank angle.\n\nStraight, single hook dovetails\n\nare employed for reliability and ease of manufacturing.\nat 100 percent speed are shown in Figure 52.\n\nDovetail stresses\n\nStrength levels even at over-\n\nspeed conditions are adequate, as shown in Figures 53 and 54.\n\nThe dovetail\n\nand the dovetail shank extension to the airfoil are progressively stronger\nthan the blade root.\n\nAirfoil\n\nThe alternating stress margin for the peak stress point is shown in the\nairfoil stress range diagram, Figure 55.\n\nBlade vibration from aeromechanical flutter and strut-induced flow\ndistortion is avoided.\n\nResonant frequencies of the blade panels are shown\n\nin the blade frequency-speed diagram of Figure 56.\n\nAll blade natural fre-\n\nquencies are more than 15 percent above both the 3/rev excitation of the\nfront frame struts and the 54/rev excitation of the rear frame stators.\n\nAnalysis of blade torsional flutter indicates that the three blade\npanels have the following flutter margins:\n\nPanel\n\nPercent of Flutter\nMargin at Fan Stall\n\n1\n\n28%\n\n2\n\n28%\n\n3\n\n59%\n\nThese margins, relative to limiting levels, are illustrated in Figure 57.\n\n34\n\nShrouds and Seals\n\nThe outer part-span shroud is more highly stressed than th<?\nshroud.\n\nAs can be seen in Figure 58, at the peak steady state stress of\n\n95.0 Ksi, the margin of safety for alternating stress is 0.44.\n\nThe blade tip section transitions from an airfoil into the blade tip\nshroud and siderails as shown in Figure 59.\nfan tip flowpath and supports the seal.\n\nThe blade tip shroud forms the\n\nThe siderails support the turbine\n\nbuckets and transmit bucket loads to the blade.\n\nThe tip shroud and the\n\nsiderails are machined as integral parts of the blade.\n\nThe blade tip shroud, like the siderails, is tapered to reduce weight.\nNo rupture life is consumed in the blade shroud; therefore, the limiting\ndesign criteria is fatigue.\n\nThe stress range diagram (Figure 60) shows\n\nthat with a criterion of 10 Ksi alternating stress, there is an alternating\nstress margin of 1.05 at the peak steady state stress point.\n\nThe seals (Figure 59) are 0.015\n41 sheet.\n\ninches thick and are formed from Rene\n\nThese single-tooth running seals rub the stationary honeycomb\n\nseal strips on the front frame-bellmouth assembly and the rear frame\nassembly, blocking hot gas leakage from the tip turbine into the fan.\n\nThe\n\nseals support only their own weight and are, therefore, not highly stressed.\nThe seals are brazed to the fan tip shroud, and are replaceable.\n\nSiderails\n\nThe siderails, shown in Figure 59, are tapered along the tangential\nsurface to obtain maximum material utilization and to reduce weight.\n\nThe\n\nouter portion of the siderails is in the same temperature environment as\nthe braze material.\n\nAt these temperatures, negligible rupture life is\n\nconsumed; therefore, fatigue is the limiting design criteria for\nthe siderails.\n\nThe siderail vibratory stress limit is 10,000 psi.\n\nThe\n\nmaximum siderail stress and margin of safety are shown in Table V.\n\n35\n\nThe siderail stress range diagram is shown in Figure 61.\n\nTurbine\n\nThe turbine contains 352 hollow uncooled buckets, arranged into 88\nsectors of four buckets each.\nblade.\n\nEach sector is an integral part of one fan\n\nThis integral blade turbine concept is similar to that of the\n\nLF460 and LF468.\n\nA blade-turbine sector, shown in Figure 59, consists of:\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nFour buckets, each with integral internal stiffener and integral tip\nshroud.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nA two-piece sheet metal box section.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nTwo one-piece sheet metal air seals.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nOne fan blade with integral siderails, part-span shrouds, and blade\ntip shroud.\n\nThe buckets are equally-spaced over the fan blade.\n\nThe box section\n\npositions the buckets and adds structural rigidity by absorbing bucket gas\nbending loads.\n\nThe siderails are integral parts of the blade.\n\nThe attach-\n\nment of the buckets and box section to the siderails is the only structural\nbraze joint in the blade-turbine sector assembly.\n\nDesign Requirements\n\nThe turbine has been designed to satisfy the life and cyclic requirements defined in Section III. These include:\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n1200 hours life.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nCapability of withstanding 14,400 start-stop cycles.\n\n36\n\nIn addition, the rotor system is designed to provide:\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nMinimum axial clearance of 0.45 inches between the turbine and any\nstationary fan component.\n\nDesign Criteria\n\nThe following criteria have been established:\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nAll stresses must be less than:\n\ni\n\n\'\n\n*\n\n0.02 minimum yield strength at 106 percent speed.\n\n*\n\nMinimum rupture strength at 100 percent speed derated for thin\nwall high temperature effects.\n\n*\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n107 cycles on the stress range diagram at 100 percent speed.\n\nBucket uncorrected gas bending stress must be less than 10,000 psi.\nThis is a criterion which regulates the bucket stiffness for acceptable vibratory stress.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nGas bending stress during one engine-out must be less than twice the\ngas bending stress during normal operation.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThe endurance limit of all thin-wall high-temperature components must\nbe no more than 70 percent of the material minimum endurance limit.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nAll calculated turbine natural frequencies must be at least 15 percent\nhigher than any known per-rev excitation frequency in the operating\nrange of 70 to 100 percent speed.\n\nThe turbine mechanical design is based on the metal temperatures shown\nin Figure 62.\n\nThese temperatures were calculated based on LF336 turbine\n\ncarrier heat transfer data measured during recent fan tests, adjusted for\nthe exhaust gas temperature of the YJ97-GE-100 gas generator.\n\n37\n\nBucket\n\nThe bucket cross section is shown in Figure 63.\n\nThe one-piece bucket\n\nand tip shroud (Figure 59) is manufactured from a Udimet 700 forging.\nElectric Chemical Machining (ECM) and Electric Discharge Machining (EDM)\nare used to generate the external contours and surfaces.\n\nThe inside\n\ncavities with integral stiffener are formed by ECM. This manufacturing\nprocess eliminates critical leading and trailing edge welding, brazing,\nand bend-forming problems.\n\nThe leading edge suction surface wall thickness\n\nis twice as thick as the other walls.\n\nThis added thickness and the solid\n\nleading edge provide added resistance to foreign object damage compared to\nprevious bucket designs.\n\nThe turbine frequency-speed diagram is shown in Figure 64.\n\nAs indicated,\n\nno critical excitations exist throughout the turbine operating range of 70\nto 100 percent rpm.\n\nThe bucket steady state stress is given in Table V.\n\nBased on this\n\nstress, the bucket uses no appreciable amount of its rupture life during\nits operation.\n\nFatigue is the limiting design criteria for the bucket.\n\nThe stress range diagram for Udimet 700 at 1300\xc2\xb0F is shown in Figure 65.\nAs shown in Figure 65 and in Table V, the bucket meets the requirements\nof both the steady state and the one engine-out operating conditions.\n\nBucket Tip Shroud\n\nAs in the bucket, fatigue is the limiting design criteria in this component.\n\nFigure 66 is the stress range diagram for Udimet 700 at 1400\xc2\xb0F.\n\nAs indicated in this figure, there is adequate alternating stress margin\nfor the fatigue sensitive area of the shroud.\n\nBraze Joint\n\nThe buckets are held by the siderails and by the vertical walls of the\n\n38\n\nbox section.\n\nThe horizontal box members and the braze fillets are con-\n\nservatively considered as having no major load carrying ability. A rupture\nstress limit of 11,000 psi at 100 percent rpm, based on a 100 percent life\nconsumption, was set for the braze.\n\nThe braze area was selected so that the\n\nstress level was within this rupture life requirement.\n\nDisk\n\nThe disk and shaft transmit blade and bucket loads to the bearings,\nand must have sufficient strength to limit rotor tip deflection to reasonably\nsmall clearance variations with the non-rotating parts.\n\nDesign Requirements\n\nThe disk and shaft are designed to satisfy the following requirements:\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nDesign speed of 100 percent rpm (3637 rpm)\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nBurst speed not less than 122 percent rpm\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nDesign life of 2400 hours\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\ni\nAble to withstand at least 28,800 start-stop cycles\nI\nDesign Criteria\n\ni\nThe following criteria have been established:\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThe steady state meanline stress must be less than the material 0.02\npercent yield strength at 106 percent speed.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThe steady state bore stress and the maximum maneuver surface stress\nmust be less than the material 0.2 percent yield strength at 106 percent speed.\n\n39\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nMinimum material properties.\n\n:\n\nDisk Design\nThe disk halves are welded together using electron beam welding. The\nstub shaft is integral with the forward disk. The disk rim is contourmachined to form the hub flowpath. The blade retainer hooks are located on\nthe aft face of the rim. The disk material (titanium 6-4) was chosen for\nits machlneability and weldability. The welded joint properties of titanium\n6-4 are greater than 90 percent of those of the parent material.\nAs seen in Table V, the limiting design criteria for the disk is low\ncycle fatigue. The disk is stiffness-limited rather than stress-limited due\nto system dynamic requirements.\nBearings and Sump\nThe bearings and sump maintain rotor concentricity and alignment with\nnon-rotating parts with minimum friction loss. The bearings and sump\ntransmit rotor thrust, maneuver loads, and other dynamic loads to the fan\nframe.\nThe LF467 bearing arrangement is similar to the LF1 configuration,\nconsisting of one deep-groove angular-contact, split-inner-ring ball bearing\nand one light-weight roller bearing. The bearings are grease-lubricated\n(Unitemp 500) as are all other General Electric lift fan bearings.\n\nThe\n\nbearings are sealed by four radial lip seals.\nThe LF467 has a common bearing housing similar to that of the LF460 and LP468,\nThis packaged bearing concept offers the following advantages:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nBearings are sealed from the environment.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nImproved maintainability of bearings and seals.\n\n40\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nSump hardware can be assembled on the disk shaft and stored until\nneeded.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nRotor assembly onto the frame is facilitated.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nThe rotor can be balanced on its own bearings.\n\nDesign Requirements\n\nThe bearings and sump have been designed to meet the following requirements :\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nMinimum life of 600 hours.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nMinimum regrease cycle of 10 hours.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nAbility to withstand a minimum of 7200 start-stop cycles.\n\nTable VI shows the LF467 bearings DN values compared with those of\nthe LF336.\n\nRear Frame Design\n\nGeneral Description\n\nThe major components of the rear frame (Figure 67) include the fan\nstator vanes, the fan and turbine exit flowpath liners, the midbox structure\nand the fan stream acoustic treatment.\nare transferred to the midbox.\n\nAir loads induced on the fan stators\n\nFrom the midbox, the loadpath goes through\n\nthe three turbine struts to the rear frame scroll brackets and the airframe\nmounts.\n\nThe rear frame is designed to accept all stator aerodynamic and\n\nmaneuver loading.\n\nNoise suppression features included in the rear frame\n\nare two chord spacing, acoustic treatment on the fan flowpath walls and four\nacoustic splitters in the fan stream.\n\nIsometric cutaways of the turbine\n\n41\n\nexhaust liner and the fan stator vane row with the acoustic splitters\nare shown in Figure 68.\nDesign Requirements\n\nIn addition to the general design requirements previously discussed\nin Section III, the following requirements are specifically applicable to\nthe rear frame:\n1.\n\nMaintain adequate clearance during all fan operating conditions to\nprevent interference with rotating parts.\n\n2.\n\nMaintain the design gap of the aft air seal to control leakage.\n\nComponent Design Description\n\nHub Cover\n\nThe hub cover provides a seal across the hub of the fan and allows\naccess to the hub instrumentation. The cover is a spherically-shaped single\nsheet of 0.020 inch aluminum ( 0 5 T6). It has a flange at the outer radius\n77\nand is bolted to the hub.\nHub Ring\nThe hub ring retains the inboard end of the fan stator vanes and\nprovides structural stiffness at the hub for mounting the inner fan flowpath.\n\nIt is fabricated from 0.010 inch thick titanium (6A1-4V).\nThe inner fan flowpath forward of the hub ring is a 0.5 inch thick\n\nfiberglass honeycomb-bonded section, having 0.030 inch face sheets and 0.375\ncell size fiberglass honeycomb.\nThe inner fan flowpath aft of the hub ring is a 1 inch thick\n\n42\n\nbonded fiberglass honeycomb section having 0.030 inch face sheets and 0.5\ninch cell size.\n\nThe face sheet forming the flowpath incorporates 0.062\n\ndiameter holes with 15 percent surface porosity for acoustic suppression.\n\nFan Stator Vanes\nFifty four fan stator vanes are incorporated into the rear frame.\nThe vanes are hollow titanium 6-4 double circular arc airfoil sections with\na thickness/chord ratio (tm/c) of 5.0 percent.\ninches.\n\nActual vane chord is 2.93\n\nThe vanes are fabricated in two sets; one set spans from the hub\n\nto the outermost splitter, the other set spans from the splitter to the\nmidbox.\n\nAll vanes are equally-spaced circumferentially with the outer set\n\nhaving a 30 degree lean angle relative to the midbox and the inner set having\na 15 degree lean angle in the opposite direction.\nThe outer set of vanes have skin thicknesses of 0.020 inches.\nThe inner set has 0.020 inch skins between the outer two splitters and at\nthe splitter box braze joints, thickness changes to 0.015 inches between\nthe second and third splitter and to 0.010 inches between the inner splitters.\nShown in Figure 69 is the die formed 0.005 inch thick internal stiffener\nwhich is brazed into each hollow vane.\n\nTwo full-span hat sections provide\n\nstability for the vane skins to preclude buckling.\n\nThe corrugated portions\n\nof the stiffener provide a loadpath across the vane at each of the structural\nboxes.\n\nAcoustic Splitters\nFour acoustic suppression splitters are included in the fan flowpath.\nIn addition to noise level reduction, the splitters also provide aeroelastic\nstability for the fan stator vanes as well as turn the fan flow toward the hub.\nThe splitters are acoustically treated aft of the stator vane trailing edge.\nThe forward portion is untreated.\nAll of the splitters are of similar construction, but have different\naerodynamic contours.\n\nAcoustic treatment consists of 0.062 diameter holes\n\n43\n\nhaving a 15 percent porosity for all treated surfaces.\n\nA corrugated strip\n\nseparates the splitter skins providing the acoustic chambers for noise suppression.\n\nThrough the vane row, the splitters are structural boxes fabri-\n\ncated from 0.020 inch thick titanium 6-4 face sheets.\n\nForward of the stator\n\nvane leading edge, the splitters are fiberglass honeycomb fabrications having\n0.030 skins and 0.375 inch honeycomb cell size.\n\nThe titanium portion of the\n\nsplitter is brazed to the stator vanes and the fiberglass bonded to the\ntitanium.\n\nA 0.010 inch thick AMS 5510 stainless steel leading edge is bonded\n\nto each splitter for added FOD resistance.\n\nMidbox\n\nThe midbox separates the fan and turbine exhaust streams.\n\nStator\n\nvane loads are transferred through the midbox to the three turbine struts.\nThe structural portion of the midbox is a brazed circumferential box section\nfabricated from 6-4 titanium into which the stator vanes and turbine struts\nare brazed.\n\nThe inner and outer face sheets are 0.020 inches thick except\n\nfor local areas 15 degrees on either side of the turbine struts where the\nthickness is increased to 0.040 inches.\n\nA 0.010 inch thick "u" channel\n\ncloses out the midbox at the forward and aft ends.\n\nThe fan forward outer\n\nflowpath and the acoustically-treated aft outer flowpath are brazed to the\nchannels.\n\nThe fan forward outer flowpath is a honeycomb structure having\n0.010 inch titanium 6-4 face sheets and 0.375 inch honeycomb cell size.\n\nA\n\nflange with gusset supports is located on the forward edge with 0.1875

separate and stabilize the inner and outer flowpaths.\n\nThree of these fairings also provide a thermal shield around each\n\nturbine strut.\n\nThe fairings are 0.25 inch thick Hastelloy X honeycomb with\n\n0.005 inch face sheets and are brazed to the inner and outer flowpaths.\nAfter the thermal shields are positioned over each strut and the liner attached\nto the midbox, a "U" channel is riveted to the aft side of the strut fairings\nto seal the midbox and strut from the turbine exhaust gas.\nTurbine Struts\n\nThe three turbine struts transfer the rear frame loads into the\nairframe mounts.\n\nThe uniball connection between the struts and the rear\n\nframe - scroll brackets assures that only axial and tangential loads (no\nmoments) are transferred into the mounts while allowing unrestricted radial\ngrowth.\n\nThe hollow bolts which bolt the struts to the rear frame - scroll\nbrackets also function as ducts to pass fan cavity purge air through the\nstruts for cooling.\n\nThe hollow strut is fabricated from 0.04\n\ninch titanium 6-4.\n\nWithin the strut are "U" channels with stock thicknesses of 0.010\n\ninch.\n\nThe channels provide added strength and stabilize the thin strut skins.\nThe turbine struts are brazed to the midbox.\n\nInsulation Blanket - Midbox\n\nThree Min-K insulation blankets each spanning 120 degrees between\nthe turbine struts insulate the midbox

cool the turbine\nstruts while the remaining air is vented to the turbine exhaust through\nholes in the outer turbine flowpath.\n\nThis, purge system is designed for\n\napproximately one pound per second flow.\n\nRear Frame - Scroll Bracket\n\nThree "A" frames connect the rear frame to the scroll.\n\nAt the\n\napex of each "A" frame is a uniball for bolting to the three rear frame\nstruts.\n\nThe two ends of the "A" frame are bolted through rod ends incor-\n\nporating uniballs to clevises attached to the scroll mounts and torque\ntube.\n\nThis arrangement allows radial expansion between the scroll and\n\nrear frame while maintaining concentricity.\n\nThe "A" frames are constructed\n\nfrom Rene* 41 tubing utilizing threaded rod ends for axial adjustment.\n\nDesign

associated insulation since that\nfeature was included in the LF460 and LF468 designs.\n\nWeight (Ibs)\nExcluding\nBellmouth\n\nIncluding\nBellmouth\n\nFront

breakdown is given for the reference size LF467 fan that\nis sized for design operation on a standard day. This size lift unit has a\n66.8 inch fan rotor tip diameter.\n\nDuring the initial sizing studies, a family\n\nof lift fans with a 1.30 pressure ratio were investigated for various ambient\ntemperature conditions at the design point.\n\nAs a separate phase of the LF467\n\ndesign activity, the weights for this family of lift fans was evaluated.\n\nThe\n\nweight scaling factors as a function of the design temperature is shown in\nFigure 73.\n\nThese data plus the appropriate performance give the aircraft\n\ndesigner the option of evaluating different levels of lift fan flat rating as\nreflected by the design ambient temperature conditions.\n\n47\n\nSECTION VII\n\n$\nPERFORMANCE\n\nThe LF467 lift fan is designed to operate with a pair of interconnected YJ97-GE-100 engines.\nFigure 2.\n\nThe installation is shown schematically in\n\nThe reference configuration of the LF467 is designed for opera-\n\ntion at sea level static standard day conditions.\n\nA family of 1.30 pressure\n\nratio lift fans was designed covering the range of ambient temperatures\nusually considered.\n\nThese designs are based on a flat-rating at all ambient\n\ntemperatures below the design conditions.\n\nThis flat-rate design approach\n\npermits the use of a smaller fan system if the design requirements are based\non hot day criteria.\n\nFor example, a standard day fan system will have a 66.8\n\ninch fan tip diameter while a fan designed for 90 degree conditions will have\na 62.2 inch diameter.\n\nThe difference in required fan size reflects\n\nthe lower gas energy at the hot day condition.\nreflect this difference in energy levels.\n\nThe thrust levels also\n\nFor example, at standard tempera-\n\ntures the 66.8 inch fan will develop about 12,885 pounds of thrust but the 62.2\ninch size will produce only 11,348 pounds of thrust because of the flat-rate\ncriteria.\n\nThe payoff comes during operation at the hot day condition where\n\nboth fan sizes will develop about the 11,348 pound thrust level.\nOff-design performance was obtained for two typical designs, the\nstandard day and 90 degree day systems.\n\nPerformance is presented only for\n\nthe nominal or no power transfer condition with the engine trimmed at the\nnominal exhaust gas temperature level of 1835 degrees Rankine.\n\nOperation at\n\nthe maximum flow transfer conditions have previously been presented in Figures\n13 through 16.\n\nThe installation assumptions used during the off-design per-\n\nformance estimates were as listed in Table I.\n\nThe ducting losses between the\n\nYJ97 engine discharge and the fan turbine inlet, including the fan scroll\nlosses, were 10.8 percent of the inlet total pressure.\n\nThe scroll loss in-\n\nherent to the lift fan system accounts for 5.8 percent of the total losses and\nis not chargeable to the system ducting.\n\n48\n\nFan system sea level static off-design performance for a range of\nengine power settings is presented in Figures 74 through 81.\n\nThe engine\n\noperating characteristics for both the standard and 90 degree day are shown\nin Figures 74 through 77.\n\nThe engine for both cases is trimmed for an exhaust\n\ngas temperature of 1835 degrees Rankine at the design speed of 101.5 percent.\nFigure 78 relates fan speed to engine speed and Figures 79 through 81 present\nthe fan operating characteristics for the two designs.\n\n49\n\nSECTION VIII\nINSTALLATION\n\nThe LF467 lift fan and the YJ97-GE-100 turbojet engine comprise the\nbasic V/STOL propulsion system.\n\nThe LF467 is designed to operate primarily\n\nin a shallow inlet installation where the upper structure surface blends into\nthe lift fan inlet bellmouth.\n\nThe lift fan exhaust system was designed for\n\noperation in combination with thrust vectoring louvers, not included as an\nintegral part of the lift fan structure.\n\nInstallation of the lift fan with\n\na deep fuselage inlet or as a cruise fan is possible provided that the\ninlet diameter is not less than 68.1 inches and blends smoothly into the 15\ndegree tip slope of the fan rotor.\n\nFor a deep installation such as in a\n\ncruise or fuselage installation, a modified fan bulletnose contour will also\nbe required as shown in Figure 43.\nLift Fan Installation\nThe LF467 lift fan system was designed to accept the exhaust gas\nfrom the gas generator through a double entry scroll.\ndrawing is shown in Figure 82.\n\nThe fan installation\n\nRequirements for connections to the aircraft\n\nduct system, and sealing and clearance provisions are similar to those presented in Reference 1 for the LF460.\n\nThis installation represents the ref-\n\nerenced LF467 system designed for standard day conditions.\n\nInstallation\n\ndimensions covering a range of design temperatures to 100 degrees Fahrenheit\nare listed in Table VIII.\n\nThese dimensions reflect the changes of fan size\n\nwith varying design temperatures and flat rating at all temperature levels\nbelow the design value.\nWeights and Inertias\nWeight and inertia data for the basic LF467 fan system are presented\nin Table IX.\n\nThese data are applicable for evaluation of the particular mount\n\nreactions under maneuver load conditions.\n\nRepresentative weight scaling data\n\nfor a range of different design temperatures are shown in Figure 73.\n\n50\n\nMounting System\nThe fan mounting configuration is shown in Figure 83.\n\nThe mounting\n\nsystem must maintain concentricity between the front frame, rotor and scroll\nwhile providing for thermal expansion of the hot scroll and the large piston\nload acting on the scroll at the inlets.\nMount B reacts all fan loading in the Y direction and is designed\nas a scroll-to-airframe\n\nmount to provide a direct loadpath to the airframe\n\nfor the 9,600 pound scroll piston load.\nfor thermal growth of the hot scroll.\n\nThis mount also acts as the hardpoint\nMounts A, B and C react to all fan loading\n\nin the Z direction and are designed as direct loadpaths to the airframe for\nthe rotor thrust, scroll and rear frame lift, and axial gyroscopic loads.\nMounts B and D react to all fan loads in the X direction.\n\nMount D is a drag\n\nlink mount which is necessary to provide in-plane stability to the scroll\nduring an engine-out operating condition.\nTabulated in Table X are the mount reactions for the various types\nof loading conditions.\nYJ97 Installation\nInstallation requirements for the YJ97-GE-100 are presented in\nReferences 1 and 2.\n\n51\n\nSECTION IX\nDISCUSSION OF RESULTS\n\nThe program requirement was the concept definition of a 1.30 pressure\nratio lift fan using the LF460 and LF468 fan systems as a basis for the design.\nThe objective was to combine a reduction in jet noise floor with extensive fan\nacoustic treatment to achieve an acceptable fan noise level consistent with a\nsix fan system objective of 100 PNdB at 500 foot sideline.\n\nA simple single-\n\nbubble scroll and three strut front frame were used to minimize the weight\nassociated with the large fan diameter and massive exhaust suppression system.\nAt the noise rating point, the LF467 fan jet velocity is 594 feet\nper second and the turbine jet velocity is 642 feet per second.\n\nA comparison\n\nof the LF467 jet velocities with the jet velocities of the previous LF460 and\nLF468 designs is given in the following table.\n\nThe resulting Jet noise char-\n\nacteristics are also compared.\nLF460\n\nLF468\n\nLF467\n\nFan Jet Velocity, ft/sec\n\n682\n\n560*\n\n594\n\nTurbine Jet Velocity,

PNdB\n50\n\n85.9\n\n75.6\n\n79.8\n\nThe suppressed noise of the LF467 fan system was reduced to 92.5\nPNdB through the use of exit stator lean and extensive exhaust suppression.\nTotal fan system noise including both jet and fan noise is 94.0 PNdB, including\nacoustic exit louvers.\n\nThis level, that is comparable to the 93.5 PNdB level\n\nof LF468 lift fan, a 1.25 design fan pressure, is possible primarily because of\n\n*It is noted that the jet velocities presented for the LF468 are for a 90\xc2\xb0F\nday, while the LF460 values are for standard day conditions. On a standard\nday, the LF468 jet velocities would be slightly lower than the values shown.\n\n52\n\nthe additional acoustic feature of 15 degrees of exit stator lean.\n\nThe diffi-\n\nculty of including stator lean in a heavily suppressed fan system was overcome\nin the LF467 design by the use of aerodynamically loaded splitters plus the\naddition of diffusion within the exhaust suppressor flowpaths.\nThe use of the single bubble scroll and modified three strut front\nframe, as identified during the LF468 design study, helped to minimize the\nincrease in fan weight due to the increased diameter and heavy exhaust treatment.\n\nA comparison of the three lift fans in LF4XX family is made in the\n\nfollowing table:\nStandard Day\nLF460\n\nLF468*\n\nLF467\n\nMax

pressure ratio for the comparable LF467 and LF468 systems.\nThe reduction in thrust/weight as compared to the LF460 is due to the addition\nof the exhaust suppression system that was partially compensated for by the\nuse of the lighter weight scroll and front frame.\n\nA weight savings of about\n\n70 pounds is anticipated for the LF460 when modified to include the revised\nscroll and front frame system.\nThe major disadvantages of the family of heavily suppressed low\nnoise fans, the LF467 and LF468, is the increase in envelope dimensions\nassociated with the increased fan diameter and added length for the exhaust\nsuppressor.\n\nA comparison of maximum envelope dimensions is given in the\n\nfollowing table;\n\n*The weight and thrust of the LF468 are based on a lift fan with a flat rating\nbetween standard and 90 degree days.\nResults of the LF467 study show that a\nsystem designed for flat rating will exhibit almost constant thrust/weight\nratios even though the thrust levels change significantly.\n\n53\n\nLF460\n\nLF468\n\nLF467\n\nMax Thrust\n\n15057\n\n14815\n\n15692\n\nFan Tip Diameter\n\n60.0\n\n68.5\n\n66.8\n\nMax Depth\n\n19.32\n\n34.2\n\n36.4\n\nMax Lateral

splitters.\nRadial loading of the acoustic splitters plus diffusion in the annular\nflowpaths downstream of the stator are required to achieve reasonable\nstator aerodynamic loading.\n\nThis is an improvement over previous de-\n\nsigns where stator lean with heavy treatment did not appear feasible.\n\n2.\n\nThe inclusion of stator lean in a 1.30 pressure ratio system resulted\nin an estimated overall noise level of 94.0 PNdB.\n\nThis level is com-\n\nparable to a 93.5 PNdB for a 1.25 fan without stator lean.\n\nThus, with\n\nthe assumption of a possible 1 to 2 PNdB noise reduction during detailed\noptimization studies plus a modest amount of fan inlet treatment, it\nappears feasible that the overall noise level for a 6 fan research aircraft could achieve the objective level of less than 100 PNdB.\n\n3.\n\nAdditional analysis and design of the three strut front frame and\nsingle bubble scroll did not indicate any mechanical design deficiencies\nor increases in weight over previous concept definition studies.\n\nThe\n\nweight advantage for this type of system is achieved at a small\nsacrifice of a deeper fan installation.\n\n4.\n\nDesign of lift fans for above standard day temperatures and with flat\nrating yields fan sizes significantly smaller than comparable standard\nday designs.\n\nA 1.30 pressure ratio fan system using the YJ97 will have\n\na tip diameter of 66.8 for a standard day and 62.2 for a 90 degree design,\nThere is very little difference of thrust at the 90 degree day for the\ntwo designs.\n\nThus, it is important to consider the aircraft design\n\ncriteria during the design of the appropriate V/STOL propulsion units.\n\n55\n\n5.\n\nA fan system with a design pressure ratio of 1.30 and incorporating\nstator lean with extensive exhaust treatment represents a reasonable\ncompromise between the desirable high pressure ratio system, greater\nthan 1.35, based on aircraft system requirements and the noise requirement of less than 100 PNdB for a six fan research aircraft.\n\n56\n\nNOMENCLATURE\n\nSYMBOL\n\nDEFINITION\n\nUNITS\n\nC\n\nChord\n\nDFT\n\nFan Tip Diameter\n\nin\n\nD-Factor\n\nDiffusion Factor\n\nin\n\nFn\n\nNet
