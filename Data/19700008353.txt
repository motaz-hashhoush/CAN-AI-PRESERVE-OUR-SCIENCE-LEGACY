With\n\nthe new furnace the variation cannot be read using an optical pyrometer\n\n(Leeds & Northrup cat. 13-87?- 10, cent. 775 0 to 20000).\n\n\'\'\'he induction furnace is a water-cooled 20-kw\n220 v single-phase continuous -input Ajax Northrup High Frequency Converter\nwhich makes use of an H 2 -pressurized spark gap. Thi.a unit has been adapted\nto the Material Research Corporation\'s vertically mounted bed previously\nused in our "shot tower" technique. The induction coil can thus be\nproperly positioned with respect to the carbon crucibles in Which\nmat.erlals are melted. Melting times are now a matter of 1-5 mim-tas for\nour crucible dimensions (1-314" i.d. X 8") rather than several hours. To\ndate the highest temperature attained is 15250 C in one crucible att\n\ndet,ornined with a Leeds & Northrup optical pyrometer.\n\nOur technique is to melt the material\n\n3-5 tines\n\ninside the crucible, each time allowing solidification and then reversing\nthe resulting metal cylinder within the crucible. Sm^11 holes (about\n0.006" diameter) in the Lase of the crucible allow the melt to be forced\n\np.g\xe2\x80\xa2 5\n\nout under p ressure (up to 40 psig of argon) into a slightly pressurised\n\n( 2 -5\n\npsig) wArover, atmosphere quartz shot tower of 2" i.d. and about 8 \xc2\xb0\n\nhel7ht, Very small spher2cal balls are collected at Ue basel their sizes\nvary frrra a feu tens of microns to several h1indreds. Distributions of ball\nsizes vary, of course, with the site, number, and irregularity of drilling\nof tj,,e holes in the crucit,le.\n\nThe shorter catalyst melting, tunas now have\nresillted in a backlog of materials awaiting, the relatively limited\ngrinding facilities on hand (see p.11 ).\n\nB. l .b Catalyst GrindLm\n\nOri,rinally, the crystalline materials were ground\nin an aluminum oxide mortar frcm Fisher Scientific Campany. This resulted\nin a fairly coarse powder. This powder, when 11u Cher ground in tungsten\ncarbide mortars ;Fisher Scientific Ccmpany), produced a satisfactory\nproduct. Put the tungsten carbide mortars are small and hold only 2 -3\ngrans of ppDwder. In rot.h mortars Triton-X-100 (Rohm & Haas) and ethyl\na] cohol (A. if. Thomas) urere used as grinding media. The ethyl alcohol\ne\xe2\x80\xa2.aporatad so that unatt^nded operation overnight was impossible.\n\nAbout the beginning of the quarter we substituted\nglycerol as a grinding medium. It does not evaporate and appearea\nsatisfactory, as the fines resultinC from prolonged grinding were at\nleast as sna11 as those previously obtained. However, the initial results\n\npr. ^a 6\n\nof `rJAmiin; in -lyeerol were Lan or brown powders; uhaY%as previous\n,- rindinr, a:ui s produced black powders..\n+\n\nT he implications of these color\n\ncharw.es were not in nediat.ely understood.\n\nTrio cu\xc2\xb1put, imuld still have been very small, even\nii9ir4, ;-,lyoerol. Hence,\n\nw4 attn n,pted to utilize an attritor tall mill\n\n(Union P:- ocess Inc., Akron, Ohio) for producing\n\nfires. 1"hese\n\nwills take\n\nas least 100 grams at a time,\n\nThe mills are new, and their proper use is a\nmatter of consideralae trial arri error. After having produced mediocre+\nmaterials for a relatively long, time, they now yield the finest and n1,nt\nuniform material we have obtained.\n\nTwo grinding techniques are beirAF used. One is a\nmechanized mortar-pestle of rather mall volune, and the other is an\naccelerated ball mill operation. The former\n\nuses\n\nFisher Mortar Grinders\n\nA.-323 V (2) an^i the latter an electrically stirred Attritor Fall )Kill,\ntypri P, size 01 from Union Process Inc. of Akron, Ohio. The material of\nthe Fisher nortar is al=ina; the attritor hails are 3/8" stainless steel.\n\nOririnally grinding; was done in denatured ethyl\nAlcohol to which a trace of Triton X-100 (Rohm & Haas) surfacta.zt vas\naddod. Evaroration of t}-.e alcohol prevented continuous grinding; and also\nresulted in some of the fines eseapirw_ fran the mortar during grindirg,\n\n0\n\npage 7\n\nWe have since chan\xe2\x82\xac;ed to glycerol (Matheson Coleman & Bell, GR M5) in the\nMortar and an 80-20 It glycerol -water\n\nsolution for holding th\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nsuspension in the attritor. Continuous\n\nmaterials in\n\ngrinding is carried out without\n\nsi7nificant loss of material.\n\nCher original fine arindi.ng operation was\n\nundertaken\n\nwith a tungsten caroide mortar- pestle combination of limited oapacity,\nro,.j ,hly 1/10 that of th alumina c -n5ination.\nour materials Is attainable in these units,\nP s of powder\n\nWhile very fine\n\nour output\n\nwas\n\nof\n\ngrindlrw\n\nlimited to 2 -3\n\nper week.\n\nOrleinally the attritor was used unsuccessfully\nwith large diameter particles of the relatively soft material AuCu plus\n--.%\n! I\n,\n\nat-% Al. No fine powder resulted,\n\nbut the balls were\n\nmerely flattened\n\nInto comparatively large platelets.\n\nSubsequently, we\n\nmlich s-na_Ller initial particle\n\nlearned that the attritor requires\n\nsizes (100 mesh) which we can attain with 96\n\nhours alunina mortar Frindir4,.. This resulted in muen impro^red\ngrLndir4-, and it is now being investigated in\nspeed. We fiiv1\n\nattritor\n\nterms of time and stirring\n\ncolor c:ianges in the fines going frem tan to brown\n\nto\n\na\n\ndeep black as our average particle size becomes smaller and approaches\nof visible light wavelengths. Inspection\nma g nifying power up to 2,000 shows the\n\ntimes are increased.\n\n,{\n\nWith an optical\n\ndecreased sizes as\n\nthat\n\nmicroscope of\nattritor grinding\n\npage 8\n\nA comparison between a brown and a black powder\nas seen by tlie microscope with 1 1,000 magnification is shown in Fig. 1.\nT`,e finished powders are repeatedly washed in alcohol and distilled\nwa}^r; the flnes are precirltat^d out of suspension using a small\ncentrifuge.

Nevertheless, contrifuging,\n^x{rticularl;; so for the finest powders, is slow, taking about s day for\nan 80\xe2\x80\x94Cram load. It has become the bottleneck of catalyst production.\nThe powders when dry are ready for use in electrodes.\n\nChan1;es and Powder Color\n\nWe have tried to correlate electrode performanoe to the -color of the powders The colors change Frith decreasing site and\npercentage of larger particles and range from tan to deep black.\n\nAt the same time as the color changes, the apparent\ndensity of the particles al so chanF es\n\n3. 0\na\n\nc\n\nrepresentative values are about\n\ngrams/cm 3 for the tans, 2.3 for brown, 1.01 for some early blacks to\n\nMinimum\n\nof 0.73 [!/Cm3 for the latest products of the attritor.\n\nFor a tan colored powder all the particles are relatively\nla7,,e as obser-!ad in the optical microscope, ranging from 1 micron to 10.\naf- spread of particle sizes is not uniform but may approximate a\n\nMaxwellian distribution.

This is not necessa^ily\neither the smallest or thn bc+st. Farticle size for optimal catalytic\nactivity. Perhaps much work will remaiii to be done in this direction.\nbut, for the time being this represents all we can do, and wa shall stand\non Uie basis of the results obtained from these powders.\n\nAs the consequences of inadequate grindinu were not fully\nunderstood, it Is difficult to evaluate the variations of electrode\ncompositior that have been tested in the past. These are \'being collated\nand should provide a valuable hackFround to electrode fab- lcations using\nblacks exclusively.\n\nConsiderable work a}ee remains to be done hefore our electrodes\ncan be considered optimal. The techniques are posvibly good enouzh to\ndisFlay the properties of the (-.atalysts to advantage. During the next\nmonth a decision must be reached on this point, too, so that we can\nproceed with life testing.

We discovered on changing\ntt:M acid mediiva that part of the difficulty lies in\n\nsane\n\nleaching of\n\ncopper. :\'his copper apparently was not present In the alloy form which\nis impmrvious to chemical attack.

Improved Electrode Resistance\n\nImprovement in conductivity of our materials will\nresult from greater attention to annealing. Early work with thin films,\nwhich established the advisability of using ordered alloys as catalysts,\nwas performed with carefully annealed specimens. Our shot tourer method\nof preparing catalysts has tended to disre;zard this requirement, and our\nearly success with ground samples caused us to o- arlook this extra\nrefinement. However, with annealing the roan temperature conductivity\nof . \xc2\xadflered all o; s incr"ases `Dy about a factor of 5 = over that of\nthe completely disordered state. Hence, we export in the future to\nsu )nit our fines to a suitable annealing cycle in an argon atmosphere,\n\nIn conclusion we expect that by use of the particle site\nseparator, by removal of nor.-crystalline materials, and by annealing,\ni\n\nimproved and more consistent catalysts will be obtained.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 "The Modern Theory of Solids", by Frederick Seitz, First Edition,\nMcGraw-Htll Hook Co.
