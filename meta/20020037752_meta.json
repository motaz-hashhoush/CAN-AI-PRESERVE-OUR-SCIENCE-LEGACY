To further investigate this, we simultaneously measured the pyschophysical and eye-movement responses (with an ISCAN RK426 IR tracker)to drifting plaids in a direction discrimination task. Three observers were instructed to track a plaid (Type I 90 deg.; TF = 4 Hz, SF = 0.6 c/d; windowed by a circular spatial gaussian) and to respond whether the motion was to the right or left of pure vertical. Three plaid directions were presented (-2, 0, 2 deg. with respect to straight down), so there was uncertainty in the perceptual judgements. This enabled us to examine the trial-by-trial relationship between the eye movements and psychophysical responses. The eye-movement direction was computed to be the slope of the best fitting line to the initial 300 ms of saccade-free tracking (near open-loop). Again, we found the mean psychophysical and oculomotor responses were correlated. The mean percentages of rightward responses were 6, 27, 87%, and the mean normalized eye-movement directions were -1.5, 0, and 1.0 deg. for the -2, 0, and 2 deg. stimuli respectively. We also computed the trial-by-trial correlation by performing an SOC analysis. The mean correlations were 0.52, 0.66, and 0.67 for our three observers. Because of eye-tracker measurement noise, the above results are lower limits on the actual correlation. These results support the view that the oculomotor and perceptual system share common motion inputs.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20020037752, "endDate": "1995-11-16T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "25th Annual Meeting of Society for Neuroscience", "location": "San Diego, CA", "id": "d99ada4ff8c14facbd1e1d22f2db4edc", "startDate": "1995-11-11T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20020037752, "id": "3cfe2050f09c461caf347be28ac20889", "publicationDate": "1995-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
