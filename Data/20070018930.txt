b'A 10-acre stadium\nenclosure highlights examples\no aerospace spinoff in the field\nf\nof construction\n\nA Roof\nF rThe\no\n\nLions House\nFans of the National Football League\'s\nDetroit Lions don\'t worry about gameday weather. Their magnificent new\nPon tiac Stadium has a domed, airsupported, fabric roof that admits light\nbut protects the playing field and patrons\nfrom the elements. The 80,000-seat\n"Silverdome" is the world\'s largest\nfabric-covered structure-and aerospace\ntechnology played an important part\nin its construction.\nThe key to economical construction of the Silverdome-and many\nother types of buildings-is a spinoff of\nfiber glass Beta" yarn coated with Teflon"* TFE fluorocarbon resin. The big\nadvance it offers is permanency.\nFabric structures-tents, for examplehave been around since the earliest\nyears of human civilization. But their\ncoverings-hides, canvas and more recently plastics-were considered temporary; though tough, these fabrics were\nsubject to weather deterioration. Teflon\nTFE-coated Beta Fiberglas is virtually\nimpervious to the effects of weather\nand sunlight and it won\'t stretch,\nshrink, mildew or rot, thus has exceptional longevity; it is also very strong,\nlightweight, flame resistant and requires no periodic cleaning, because\ndirt will not stick to the surface of\nTeflon TFE. And to top all that, it\ncosts only 30 to 40 percent as much as\nconventional roofing. Coated fibrous\n\nglass has sparked new interest in fabric\nstructures; it is finding wide application as permanent roofing for a growing number of buildings ranging from\na vocational school in wintry Alaska to\na recreational facility amid the scorching sands of Saudi Arabia.\nThe material\'s origin dates to 1967,\nwhen NASA was looking for a new fabric\nfor Apollo astronauts\' space suits. It had\nto be durable and noncombustible, yet\nthin, light and flexible. Owens-Corning\nFiberglas Corporation, Toledo, Ohio,\nhad been experimenting with an ultrafine glass fiber yarn called Beta yarn,\nwhich seemed to fill the bill. Under\nNASA contract, Owens-Corning wove\nthe yarn into a fabric, coated it with\nTeflon TFE, manufactured by Du Pont\nCompany, Wilmington, Delaware, and\ntailored it for astronaut wear. Later, to\nadapt the material to construction use,\nOwens-Corning thickened the yarn,\nChemical Fabrics, Inc., Bennington, Vermont wove it into a stronger and more\nporous fabric, and applied a heavier coating of Teflon TFE. The three companies have teamed with the pioneer firm\nin air-supported structures- Birdair\nStructures, Inc., Buffalo, New York-to\nconstruct a variety of fabric-enclosed\nbuildings, among them the Silverdome.\nThe Silverdome story illustrates\nwhy fiber glass Beta yarn coated with\nTeflon TFE has a bright future in the\nconstruction industry. The city of Pontiac, some 25 miles north of downtown\nDetroit, developed a plan to build an\nall-purpose stadium. The prime purpose was to provide a home for the\nLions, but the Pontiac Stadium Authority wanted a year-round facility\nthat could generate more income by\nhousing such events as conventions,\nconcerts, rodeos, circuses, and trade\nshows. Michigan\'s winter weather\ndemanded an enclosed structure, but\nfinancing was limited and the cost of\na steel-roofed stadium was prohibitive;\nNew Orleans\' Superdome, for example,\nhad cost $168 million. When architects\nand consulting engineers advanced the\nfabric dome idea and estimated a very\nlow $10 million roofing cost, Pontiac\nofficials speedily adopted the plan.\nThey budgeted $56 million for total\nconstruction costs and, incredibly, completed the stadium slightly below that\nfigure.\n\n*\n**\n\nRegistered lad ern ark, Owens-Corning\nFiberglas Corporation\nRegistered trademark, Du Pant Company\n\nIn construction, the 10-acrefabric\nenvelope was stretched over a reinforcing\nnetwork of steel cabIes anchored to a\nconcrete ring running around the top of\nthe stadium. T o provide primary support, the envelope\'s compartments were\ninflated by 29 air-blowing fans; after\ninitial inflation, only two or three fans\nare required to maintain pressure and the\nrest are used for ventilation. The completed fabric dome weighs only 200 tons,\nwhere a comparably-sized conventional\nroof would weigh about 6,000 tons. This\n\nThe Silverdome, home of the Detroit\nLions at Pontiac, Michigan, has an\nair-supported, domed fabric roof for\nyear-round utility. The coated fiber\nglass fabric is a strong, flame-resistant\nmaterial originally developed for astronauts\' space suits.\nDu Pont Company\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\nis an economic bonus i n addition to the\nbasically low cost of fabric enclosure; the\nlighter weight means reduced load bearing requirements for the foundation,\nhence less steel and concrete.\nThe team of Owens-Corning, Du\nPont, Chemical Fabrics and Birdair have\ncollaborated on a number of fabric structures. Some are supported by air pressure,\nothers by cables alone. Most of the structures are in the recreational categorystadia, athletic field houses, swimming\npools, tennis courts-but the technique\nhas also been used in schools, theaters,\nexhibit halls and industrial facilities.\nWith conventional construetion costs\nstill on the upswing, you\'re likely to see a\ngreat many more permanent facilities\nenclosed by the aerospace spinoff fabric.\n\nT h e University of Santa Clara,\nCalifornia has a two-unit airsupported, fabric-covered facility.
