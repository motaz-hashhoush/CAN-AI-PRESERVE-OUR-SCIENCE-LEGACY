A new family of dry lubricants emerged from Apollo, specifically designed for long life in space, together with processes for applying them to spacecraft components in microscopically thin coatings. Lubricants worked successfully on seven Orbiting Solar Observatory flights over the span of a decade and attracted attention to other contractors which became Ball customers. The company has developed several hundred variations of the original OSO technology generally designed to improve the quality and useful life of a wide range of products or improve efficiency of the industrial processes by which such products are manufactured.", "title": "Space Coatings for Industry", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-21T05:56:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-09-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20030004804, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20030004804, "id": "53a6a40541334b4e9faee2c1da225572", "publicationName": "Spinoff 1980", "publicationDate": "1980-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20030004804.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20030004804/downloads/20030004804.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20030004804/downloads/20030004804.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20030004804/downloads/20030004804.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
