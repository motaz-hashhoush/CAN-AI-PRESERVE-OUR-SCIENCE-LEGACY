Large local food price increases over a short time period\ncan be indicative of a deteriorating food security situation and may be the\nconsequence of weather-related food production declines, Dr can simply be the result\nof price transmission from the international commodity market. Food price indices\ndeveloped by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) are used to\nmonitor food price trends at a global level, but largely reflect supply and demand\nconditions in export markets far from the places where the chronically food insecure\nlive. A much better understanding of how local staple food prices in isolated regions\nsuch as West Africa that grow most of the food they eat to better understand the\nimpact of global commodity market transformations on sensitive communities at the\nmargin. This information will also enable improved strategies for these farmers who\nare extraordinarily sensitive to climate change impacts on agricultural growing\nconditions.\n6.\n\n5 keywords : f ood security, climate change, vulnerability, environment, agriculture\n\n7.\n\nPanel theme which you feel best fits your paper:\nCausal structures of vulnerability\nAdaptive development and sustainable adaptation\n\n'
