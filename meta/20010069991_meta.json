When considering oral and written information carriers, the principle of least effort was supported with a strong preference for oral communication over written communication. In examining how the respondents select written carriers, the decision to use or not to use a written carrier was found to be primarily a function of the perceived importance of the carrier's information to a person's work. Task uncertainty and task complexity were found to be significant, but not the primary nor a totally consistent criteria. The perceived quality and accessibility of written carriers were not found significant. The findings reinforce the need for firms to hire knowledgeable employees, to provide them with comprehensive training programs, and to develop formal and informal communication networks.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "publications": [{"volume": "18", "submissionId": 20010069991, "issn": "0923-4748", "publisher": "Elsevier Science B.V.", "id": "5816a5eda1b0403f933e7b0208d91885", "publicationName": "Journal of Engineering and Technology Management", "publicationDate": "2001-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
