elastohydrodynamic (EHD) film resulting from either\nhigher rolling speeds or increased lubricant viscosity will substantially\nextend ball bearing life.\n\nThe improvement is attributed to reduced surface\n\nstresses due to a reduction of asperity contacts and redistribution of load\nby way of elastohydrodynamic pressures.\n\nWhen lubrication becomes marginal surface distress will occur, indicated initially by a burnished appearance.\n\nThis may be followed by metal transfer and\n\nwear followed by fatigue spalling.\n\nBearings on the verge of failure generate ultrasonic frequencies of measurable\namplitude before audible or mechanical signals can be detected.\n\nThis fact\n\nsuggests that ultrasonic detection equipment may provide the most useful signal\nfor monitoring incipient bearing failure.\n\nThe ultrasonic signal will appear\n\nprior to a temperature rise or increase in driving torque.\n\nThe MTI test rig mounts several ultrasonic sensors for signal pickup from the\ntest bearing.\n\nA Hewlett-Packard Delcon 4950A ultrasonic translator with probe\n\nin contact with ball bearing outer race was placed in the plane of ball path,\nvertically above bearing.\n\nSee Figure C-3.\n\nThis sensor is designed to monitor\n\nfrequencies in the 36-44 K Hz range.\n\nA Wilcoxon accelerometer, model 90, was procured for installation on the bearing\nhousing to monitor ultrasonic outputs up to 80 K Hz.\n\nThis sensor was mounted\n\nadjacent to the Delcon unit mentioned above and in the plane of the ball track.\n\nTwo Bruel & Kjaer model 4313 accelerometers were also mounted on the bearing\nhousing to monitor "low frequency" responses in the axial and radial directions.\nThese accelerometers have mounted natural resonances near 40 K Hz. and have flat\nresponse curves to 15 K Hz.\n\n-2-\n\nLubricant viscosity and flow rate, shaft speed and bearing loading are\nall controlled in the test rig.\n\nBy careful adjustment of these factors,\n\nthe onset of marginal lubrication can be established, using the ultrasonic\ndetection means.\n\nWhere the condition of marginal or inadequate lubrication\n\nis permitted to continue, other warning signs will appear such as temperature rise, increased torque, increased audible noise and increased vibration.\n\nThe wear life of a rolling element bearing is dependent on environmental\nconditions.\n\nExcessive radial clearance will develop as a result of wear.\n\nA particular bearing application will determine the permissible wear limits\nthat can be tolerated (Reference 2).\n\nWhere a sensor can provide readout\n\nunder conditions of marginal lubrication, it would be possible to log the\naccummulative total of wear life hours.\n\nA method for computing the adequacy of the lubricant film for a given set\nof speed, load and lubricating oil conditions has been developed by SKF Industries (Reference 3).\n\nA sample calculation of the Barden 107H bearing in-\n\nstallation covered by this report is included in Appendix D.\n\nReference 4 also\n\ndiscusses this computational method and points out that where the computed application factor lies between 1 and 3, possible surface wear and short life can\nbe anticipated.\n\nTest Stand Limitations\nReferring to Figure C-3, Test Rig Assembly, Partial Section A-A shows the\ntorque arm arrangement.\n\nFigure C-3 also illustrates how the radial load is\n\napplied at the bottom of the bearing housing through the right angle pulleycable system.\n\nAny application of radial load places a heavy restriction on\n\nthe freedom of the torque measuring system.\n\nTherefore, to utilize the torque\n\nmeasuring system in this series of tests, radial load was replaced by an equivalent axial load.\n\nTo establish the equivalent values, an available computer\n\nprogram, (Reference 5), was utilized. A severe overload resulting in a computed\nfatigue life of seventy-five hours can be created by applying a 1000 lb.-radial\nload in combination with a 50 lb. thrust load.\n\n-3-\n\nApproximately the same fatigue life, seventy-three hours, results from a\n1000 lb. thrust load and a 15 lb. radial load.\nactually the housing weight.\n\nThe 15 lb. radial load is\n\nIt should be noted that the seventy-three hour\n\nlife means that 90 percent of the bearings subjected to this loading will\nsurvive for at least seventy-three hours or, conversely, 10 percent will fail\nin that period.\n\nBearing Load Schedule\nThe bearing load-fatigue life relationship is given in Table I, Appendix B.\nTable V-1 in Appendix B gives the computed fatigue life values, based on\nthe A. B. Jones Computational Method, Reference 5.\n\nTable III in Appendix B presents a complete summary of all operational testing.\nTaped records from these runs when analyzed in our real time analyzer provided\nthe diagnostic information needed to establish criteria for the prototype\ndiagnostic system described in Section IV.\n\n-4-\n\nSECTION II\n\nTEST PROGRAM\n\nA.\n\nTEST FACILITY\n\nThe test facility in which the bearing tests were conducted and prototype\ndiagnostic system was evaluated was West Cell #62 and is shown in Figure C-1.\nThis facility consists of a test rig, auxiliary systems, such as loading and\nlubrication systems, and instrumentation. A detailed description of this\ntest facility follows: (See Appendix E for equipment details).\n\nTest Rig\nA system schematic of the entire test rig is shown in Figure C-2.\n\nAn assembly\n\ndrawing of the test rig, including the loading devices, is shown in Figure C-3.\nThe test-rig drive consists of an M-G set and an electrically-coupled, variable-speed, DC dynamometer.\n\nThe shaft of the dynamometer is coupled to the\n\ninput of the gear box with a Thomas Coupling.\n6.34:1.\n\nThe gear box step-up ratio is\n\nThe output of the gear-box is coupled, in turn, to the shaft of a\n\ntest spindle with a high speed Sier-Bath gear coupling (52).\n\nThe spindle (47) carries the thrust load applied during tests on a pair of\ntandem mounted spindle bearings, located at the drive end.\n\nThe test end of\n\nspindle is also supported on a pair of tandem mounted ball bearings.\n\nThese\n\nbearings carry radial load only in addition to a nominal amount of preload\napplied to the bearing system by a preload spring (70).\n\nThe ball bearing component of the test system is rotatably supported on the\nprotruding front end of the spindle shaft.\n\nThe inner race of the bearing is\n\nclamped in place between the oil seal plate (17) and locknut (60).\n\nThe housing for the test bearing consists of an outer bearing housing (18)\nand drive end seal plate (19).\n\nThe bearing housing is provided with torque arms (36) which contain ball\ninserts to reduce effects of housing misalignment on torque measurement.\n\nTwo\n\n-5-\n\nbeam supports (32) are installed on either side of the torque arm to serve\nas mounting supports for the strain-gaged beams.\n\nAuxiliary Systems\nThe auxiliary systems used apply mainly to the loading and lubrication areas.\nA detailed description of each system is given below.\n\nBearing Loading System\nThrust load is applied through an air cylinder (44) and load button (4) to a\nload ram (6) supported on a linear ball bushing (45) and pedestal (5).\n\nA\n\nDillon load cell carried on a thrust spider transfers the compressive load to\nthe test bearing.\n\nThe aircylinder has a 2.5-inch bore yielding the following\n\nrelationship between pressure and thrust load:\nF\n\n=\n\n4\n\n.9 p\n\n-\n\n50\n\nis the supply pressure to the pneumatic actuator in psig.\n\nwhere p\n\nThe constant\n\n50 represents a pull-back spring force present in the actuator, which keeps the\nactuator in retracted position when no pressure is applied.\n\nRadial loading is applied at the underside of the bearing housing through a\nsystem consisting of:\n\nan eyebolt (67), which is mounted in the bearing housing,\n\nand an aircraft steel cable (66), which connects the eyebolt with a pneumatic\nactuator (43) through a pulley (30,55) arrangement.\n\nThe actuator load character-\n\nistics can be expressed in the following form:\nF\n\n=\n\n8.3 p\n\n-\n\n60\n\n(3.25 bore cylinder)\n\nThe actuating pressure in both cases is taken from a nitrogen bottle with a regulated supply pressure.\n\nLubricating System\nThe test set up provides two lubrication systems - the primary lube system and\nauxiliary spindle ball bearing system.\ndescribed as follows:\n\nEach one of these systems is briefly\n\n-6-\n\nMain Lubrication and Scavenge System\nThe basic schematic of this system is shown in Figure C-4.\n\nThe system consists\n\nof a twenty gallon oil tank and a main lubricant pump driven by a 3 hp motor.\nThe input line to the pump is submerged in the oil tank and contains a strainer\nat the inlet to prevent coarse contaminants or objects from entering the pump.\nAt the pump discharge end the line branches off into two sections.\n\nOne of\n\nthese goes to the pressure control by-pass valve, and the other continues through\nan oil heater to a three-way valve.\nture control.\n\nThe oil heater is provided with a tempera-\n\nWhen the three-way valve is in one position, all of the oil passes\n\nthrough the heater directly into the tank.\n\nThis valve position is used to pre-\n\nheat the oil prior to the start of the test.\n\nOnce the oil is heated up, the\n\nthree-way valve is turned to its alternate position, closing off the by-pass to\nthe tank and opening the line leading to the test stand.\ntwo ten micron filters, arranged in parallel.\n\nOil then passes through\n\nOil entering the test bearing\n\npasses through a flow control micrometer valve and fixed orifice of selected\nsize.\n\nOil pressure is controlled by an adjustable by-pass valve.\n\nDischarge from\n\nthe test bearing housing is accomplished through the use of a positive displacement scavenge pump.\n\nThe output of this pump is directed into a heat exchanger\n\nwhere the excess heat picked up in the stand is removed and the cooled oil is\nreturned to the oil tank.\ntures up to 300 F.\n\nThis sytem has the capability of operation at tempera-\n\nThe lubricant employed in this series of tests was MIL-L-7808\n\nsynthetic polyester turbine oil.\n\nSpindle Lubrication System\nLubrication of the high speed spindle ball bearings is accomplished through\nthe use of an air-oil mist lubrication system.\n\nThis system was selected because\n\nof its simplicity as well as the low overall power loss resulting from air-oil\nmist lubrication.\n\nOne Norgren lubricator delivering three drops per second at\n\n40 psig is employed through a central feeding hole located between the spindle\nbearings.\n\n-7-\n\nB.\n\nINSTRUMENTATION\n\nThe test-rig instrumentation was selected to provide accurate readings of\nthe critical bearing factors which were previously arrived at on the basis\nof calculations and diagnostic usefulness.\n1.\n\nLoading\n\n2.\n\nTemperature\n\n3.\n\nBall bearing deflection under load\n\n4.\n\nVibration and noise\n\n5.\n\nOil flow to bearing components\n\n6.\n\nThese factors are:\n\nPower loss\n\nThe specific instrumentation employed to obtain the necessary data and the\nreading accuracy is discussed in the following sections.\n\nLoading\nThe bearing load arrangement employed to provide axial and radial loads to the\ntest bearing during operation is described in detail on Page10 .\nthe thrust load magnitude a calibrated load cell was used.\n\nTo establish\n\nBourdon-type pressure\n\ngages were employed for pressure measurements at the radial load cylinder.\n\nGage\n\naccuracy was + 1.0 psi resulting in a load reading accuracy of \xc2\xb1 8.3 lbs. for\nthe radial loading system.\n\nSince the applied axial load varied between 50 lbs.\n\nand 1000 lbs., the overall axial load reading accuracy varied between \xc2\xb1 1/2 lb.\nfor the low load, and \xc2\xb1 5 lbs. for the high load.\nother than housing weight.\n\nNo radial loading was applied\n\nRefer to Table 2 for dynamic capacity of bearing\n\nunder equivalent radial and thrust loads.\n\nTemperature\nTemperature measurements were obtained with copper constantan thermocouples.\nThe outputs were printed out on a multipoint temperature recorder.\n\nIndividual\n\nthermocouples were placed in the following positions as designated below:\nPositions\n\nTC designation\n\nSpindle bearing\n\n1 and 11\n\nSpindle bearing\n\n2 and 12\n\nBall bearing outer race, upper\n\n3 and 13\n\n-8-\n\nPositions\n\nTC designation continued\n\nBall bearing outer race, lower\n\n4 and 14\n\nScavenge #1\n\n5 and 15\n\nScavenge #2\n\n6 and 16\n\nBall bearing oil inlet\n\n9\n\nNote that some of the thermocouples have dual designations. This indicates\nthat the specific thermocouple occupied two points on the temperature recorder.\nThis was done to cut the time between consecutive printouts of the same thermocouple.\n\nReadout accuracy on all thermocouples is \xc2\xb1 1\xc2\xb0F.\n\nEach probe was separately precalibrated in an oil bath over a temperature range\nof 70 to 250\xc2\xb0F. bearing inner race temperature.\n\nBall Bearing Deflection\nTo provide a means of monitoring outer race cyclic strain, four (4) strain gages\nwere cemented to the ball bearing outer race on the side facing the applied\nthrust load.\n\nThe gages were placed 90 degrees apart, two in the horizontal and\n\ntwo in the vertical plane.\n\nA second strain sensing system was evaluated using a PZT crystal cemented to\nthe face of the bearing outer race beside the strain gages.\n\nVibration and Noise\nSeveral types of sensors were applied to monitor the sonic and ultrasonic spectra.\nAs illustrated on the cross section detail drawing and in the photographs, a\nDelcon 4950A ultrasonic translator was mounted vertically above the test bearing\nand in contact with the bearing outer race.\n\nThis unit is selected to monitor\n\nthe 36 - 44 K Hz range only.\n\nA Wilcoxon Model 90 piezoelectric accelerometer was cemented to the housing\nadjacent to the Delcon unit.\n\nThis unit has a mounted resonant frequency of\n\n120 K Hz and a reasonably flat response curve to 80 K Hz.\n\n-9-\n\nOn the front face of the housing, also in the plane of the spindle shaft, we\nmounted a Bruel & Kjaer Model 4313 accelerometer, using cement as the mounting\nmethod.\n\nThis unit has a mounted resonant frequency of 40 K Hz with a flat\n\nresponse curve to 15 K Hz.\n\nThe calibration curves for two of these units are\n\nincluded in the Appendix.\n\nTo monitor the audible noise spectrum and noise density or level, the Bruel &\nKjaer Model 2203 Sound Level Meter was employed.\n\nThis equipment was mounted as\n\nshown in the accompanying photograph of the test setup.\n\nA bently non-contacting shaft position indicating probe was mounted in the\nhousing to monitor shaft speed.\n\nThis unit, Model 302L-30-3.5 was positioned\n\nabout .050 inches from the rotating shaft.\n\nBuilt-in shaft runout produced a\n\nonce-per-revolution sinusoidal voltage output.\n\nBy taping the Bently signal in\n\ncombination with the other accelerometer outputs, the speed trace can be related\nto the higher frequency inputs.\n\nOil Flow\nOil flow was regulated with a Schrader Micro Valve which was precalibrated for\nuse in MIL-L-7808 oil at temperatures ranging up to 150 F.\n\nBall bearing oil\n\nsupply flow was also controlled by pressure regulation in the 10 - 50 psi range.\nReading accuracy is estimated to be \xc2\xb1 5 percent at the low flow limit and improving as the flow increases.\n\nPower Loss\nPower loss was measured through the use of torque arms built into the floating\nbearing housing.\n\nThe full arrangement is shown in Figure C-3, Section A-A.\n\nThe\n\ntwo torque arms (36) protruding from the housing contain balls (102) which transmit the torque load through a point contact onto a deflection beam that is instrumented with strain gages (35).\n\nThis beam is allowed to deflect a limited amount\n\nbefore it engages a solid stop (33).\n\nThe true value of the bearing torque\n\nmeasurements is difficult to determine inasmuch as bearing torque is affected\nto some extent by windage, oil churning and oil flow rates.\n\nIn the design of\n\nthis test vehicle, precautions have been taken to minimize oil accumulation and\n\n-10-\n\nchurning effects.\n\nThe extent to which this was actually accomplished is diffi-\n\ncult to ascertain at this stage.\n\nThe oil scavenge lines employed on the housing\n\nalso offer some restraint and thus affect torque measurements. These restraints\nhave, however, been accounted for in the initial torque calibration procedure.\n\nTo obtain meaningful torque readings, the test bearing was loaded axially.\nTable I provides the load schedule which establishes equivalent thrust loads\nto replace radial loads for a given dynamic capacity and fatigue life.\n\nC.\n\nTEST PROCEDURE\n\nWith the test in fully assembled state and the instrumentation calibrated and\nchecked out, the following test sequence was adopted:\n1.\n\nBall Bearing Normal Signature Tests\n\n2.\n\nVariable Thrust Load Bearing Tests\n\n3.\n\nBearing Lubricant Flow Tests\n\n4.\n\nInduced Fault Bearing Tests\n\nMuch of the above specified testing involved a number of separate runs to\nestablish bearing performance characteristics. Details are presented below.\n\nBall Bearing Normal Signature Tests\nThe test procedure consisted of the following:\n1.\n\nWith oil inlet maintained at 110\xc2\xb0F and 0.1 gal. per minute flow, the\ntest bearing was brought to 8000 rpm.\n\nAxial load was maintained at\n\n50 lbs.

Oil flow variations\nwere evaluated, and the bearing was operated for a considerable period at 1000\npound thrust load without external oil supply in an attempt to produce bearing\ndamage.\n\nThis bearing was finally operated after being solvent washed to remove\n\nall lubricant and it was destroyed after two minutes of running at 50 pounds\nthrust and 8000 rpm.\n\nBearing S/N 3 was evaluated for base line signatures and found:to compare well\nwith data from Bearing S/N 2.\n\nAfter complete analyses, the bearing was removed\n\nand disassembled and a simulated fault was induced by acid etch.\n\nThe race was\n\n-14-\n\nmasked with paraffin and a single relief was made across the ball path with a\nscribe.\n\nA 20 percent solution of Nitric acid at room temperature was used to\n\nproduce the defect shown on Figure G-6.\n\nThis fault simulates the typical first\n\nfatigue spall obtained by extended operation except that it extends across the\nball track.\n\nThis insures that the fault will be in the ball path for any load\n\ncondition.\n\nThe complete load and speed cycle was rerun to define sensor outputs under faultincluded conditions.\n\nReview of Bearing Instrumentation Performance\nThree individual bearings were tested with a variety of sensors to define the\nsignatures of each bearing performance parameter.\n\nThe basic goal of this pro-\n\ngram was to define a monitoring system which would detect the initial signs of\nbearing failure and permit repair or replacement to be accomplished at a conA variety of sensor types were evaluated.\n\nvenient time.\n\nThe choice of a suitable bearing condition sensor included the following criteria:\n1.\n\nThe sensor should produce positive indications of bearing fault.\n\n2.\n\nThe fault indications ideally would be unaffected by bearing\noperating conditions (load, temperature, speed).\n\n3.\n\nThe fault indicator output should vary with the state of bearing\ndeterioration to permit end-of-life predictions to be made.\n\n4.\n\nThe sensorinstallation should not restrict normal operation of the\nbearing being protected.\n\nA basic assumption is that a rolling element bearing will operate for a major\nportion of its life with very nominal operating deterioration. At a point, however, the rate of deterioration will increase and the effective useful life will\nbe limited.\n\nIn a typical application, the onset of the first fatigue spall\n\nsignals that the bearing has operated 90 to 95 percent of its effective life\nand that additional fatigue indications will occur at some exponentially increasing rate.\n\n-15-\n\nBearing Loading\nThe dynamic output of the Dillon Load Cell used to define bearing thrust load\nwas tape recorded to evaluate variations between new and damaged bearings.\n\nThe\n\nelectronics of the signal conditioning device had response to 1000 Hz but no\nresponse above two times rotation was seen.\n\nIt was concluded that bearing\n\nmounting variations could be evaluated with this type of sensing system but that\nit was not applicable to fault detection.\n\nBearing Temperature\nTest bearing outer race thermocouples were monitored throughout the test series\nfor evidence of thermal difficulties but the range of loads, speeds, and oil\nflow conditions evaluated did not produce variations which could be related to\nbearing operating condition.\n\nTesting of the S/N 2 bearing without oil flow at\n\n1000 lb.thrust load and 8000 rpm gave peak outer race temperature of 168 F at\nequilibrium.\n\nDuring this test the Amot temperature indicator for 174 F on the\n\n0\ninner race was released while the outer race temperature was 167\xc2\xb0F.\n\nential temperature of seven Fahrenheit degrees is very moderate.\n\nThis differ-\n\nIt was conclu-\n\nded that bearing temperature conditions could not be controlled accurately\nenough to produce reliable indications of bearing physical condition.\n\nBearing Deflection\nIt was thought that a deteriorated bearing might produce unique race strain\npatterns which would be detectable, so two systems were used to measure these\nindications:\n\nconventional miniature strain gages and directly applied piezo-\n\nelectric crystals which have a charge sensitivity dependent upon strain.\n\nThe strain gages used were of the foil type manufactured by Micro-Measurements.\nThese were installed circumferentially on the face of the outer race to sense\nhoop stresses developed within the race.\nan Ellis BAM-1 amplifier.\n\nBridge completion was accomplished by\n\nThe amplifier was AC coupled to the tape recorder so\n\nonly the dynamic components of strain were measured.\n\nFrequency response of this\n\nsystem was greater than 20 K Hz but significant output did not occur above 2000\nHz.\n\nDiscrete frequency components at outer race ball passing frequency occurred\n\nfor all bearing test conditions.\n\nThe ability to detect ball pass could be\n\n-16-\n\nvaluable for bearing slip or skid determination but this monitoring system did\nnot appear to be of use in this program.\n\nThe second bearing deflection monitoring system used a Clevite Corp. PZT-4\npiezoelectric crystal bonded directly to the outer race in the same plane as\nthe strain gages.\n\nThis material has the property of producing a state of\n\ncharge which is dependent upon the strain which is imposed upon the crystal.\nA Kistler Model 848 Charge Amplifier is used to produce a voltage level proportional to charge which can be tape recorded.\n\nOutput from this strain sensing system produced almost identical results to\nthose produced by the strain gage.\n\nThe predominant frequency present in its\n\nfrequency analysis was ball passing frequency but there were some small components at once and twice rotation which were not present in the strain gage setup.\nIt is felt that these were due to acceleration of the bearing housing.\n\nIt\n\nshould be noted that this material is most typically used for accelerometers\nwhere a seismic mass is supported by the crystal.\n\nIn that application extreme\n\npains are taken to isolate the PZT material from any case strain or mounting\nloads.\n\nThe conclusions about this bearing monitoring system are the same as\n\nfor the strain gage system:\n\nif ball pass measurement were needed, this would\n\nbe a way of getting it, but the basic condition of the bearing is not defined\nby its output.\n\nVibration and Noise\nA variety of monitors was used to evaluate sonic and ultrasonic vibration and\nnoise produced by the test bearings.\n\nUltrasonic Translator - A Hewlett-Packard Delcon 4950-A Ultrasonic Translator\nwas installed with its sensor contacting the outer race in line with the ball\ntrack through a housing clearance hole.\n\nOther investigators (Ref. 8) have\n\nsuccessfully used this instrument to evaluate bearing performance so an attempt\nwas made to evaluate its mechanism of fault detection.\n\nThe instrument filters\n\nthe output from its sensor and measures response in the 36 K Hz to 44 K Hz range.\nThis information is "folded" and translated to the zero to 4000 Hz range and\nindicated on a logrithmic scale (0 to 100 dB).\n\nThis "folding" process mixes\n\n-17-\n\nthe data from 36 K Hz to 40 K Hz with the data from 40 K Hz to 44 K Hz so it\nis not possible to locate specific frequency components in the translated\nspectrum, but frequency\n\nanalyses were performed on the output data to deter-\n\nmine the character of the sensor response.\n\nSpectrum analysis of output data indicated that the translated output was much\nlike "white noise" with broad random content.\nwere present.\n\nNo specific discrete components\n\nThe overall level of noise did increase when the induced fault\n\nwas included in the test of bearing No. 3 such that the meter indication\nincreased from 47 dB up to 71 dB, an increase by a factor of 16 in level.\n\nCom-\n\nparisons between new bearings gave a spread of 18 dB or a factor of 8 in level\nso this points out.that the best application of this device is for periodic\nmonitoring of an installed system to evaluate deterioration with time.\n\nIt is\n\nalso felt that any hand probing device such as this one requires considerable\noperator skill to get dependable results.\n\nWilcoxon Accelerometer - A Wilcoxon Model 90 accelerometer was housing mounted\nin the vertical plane of the bearing to measure radial acceleration responses.\nThis accelerometer was chosen for its broad frequency response characteristics\nwhich permit investigation of ultrasonic outputs.\n\nAdvertised response is for\n\noutput flat to 40 X Hz and for a mounted resonance at 120 K Hz.\n\nThis sensor\n\nprovided maximum definition of test bearing condition with significant output\ndifferences for the variation in performance evaluated and its response will be\ndiscussed fully in the Analysis section of this report.\n\nBruel and Kjaer Model 4313 Accelerometer - Two of these accelerometers were\nused to evaluate,,performance in the frequency range to 15,000 Hz\':\n\none for\n\nradial acceleration and the second for axial acceleration. These sensors were\nuseful for defining performance over the usual machinery analysis frequency\nrange and are rugged and straightforward to use.

was placed approximately\nsix inches from the test bearing to provide sound spectrum data.\n\nThe sound\n\npressure level produced by the test facility and lubrication was unfortunately\nat such a high level that no significant change in output occurred with all the\ntest variables attempted.\n\nTypically, good sound information cannot be obtained\n\nunless the background level is more than 10 dB below the level present with the\ntest part in operation.\n\nShaft Orbit\nShaft radial orbit was measured using a Bently Nevada eddy current displacement\nsensor and detector to relate shaft position to operating events.\n\nThe area\n\nviewed by the sensor had a mechanical runout of 0.003 inches which gave a sinusoidal reference signal for position and also for speed indication.\n\nThe output\n\nof this sensor did not change with variations in bearing operation (other than\nspeed).\n\nOil Flow\nIt was intended to measure bearing performance under varying oil flow conditions\nto determine if any other parameter than temperature would be an effective monitor.\n\nIt was found that there was no measurable output (other than bearing\n\ntemperature) which could detect the presence or lack of oil flow, even under\nextremes of loading.\n\nConsequently, test data presented is for an oil inlet\n\ntemperature of 110 F and a flow rate of 0.1 gal per minute.\n\nNo testing was done\n\nto evaluate flooded oil flow conditions.\n\nPower Loss\nSteady-state torque measurements were limited by DC drift problems so detailed\npower loss data were not available for the bearing test conditions evaluated.\nHowever, dynamic torque outputs were successfully tape recorded and scanned for\ncontent which might contribute to definition of bearing operation condition.\nIt was found that once-per-revolution and twice-per-revolution components were\npresent but no higher frequency component responses were produced.\n\nIt was con-\n\ncluded that this sensing technique did not produce pertinent condition information.\n\n-19-\n\nAnalysis of Test Data\nExperimental data from the various sensors used was recorded on a Lockheed\nElectronics 7 Channel tape recorder.\n\nTape recorder speed was set at 30 inches\n\nper second to provide frequency response from 200 Hz to 100 K Hz on the Direct\nRecord Channel and DC to 10 K Hz response on five FM Record Channels.\ncommentary was also recorded.\n\nVoice\n\nPlayback of test data was done at 7 1/2 inches\n\nper second to compress the data into a frequency range compatible with a Spectral\nDynamics 301A Real Time Analyzer (0 to 20 K Hz) which was used for most of the\nsignature analysis work.\n\nThis unit provides narrow band analysis capability\n\nvirtually instantaneously (50 m seconds after the data is fed into the analyzer).\nFor a portion of the analysis a Spectral Dynamics Model 302B Time Averager was\navailable to reduce the spurious components of the data.\n\nA photo of the analy-\n\nsis center used for data reduction is included as Figure G-7.\n\nDuring testing of the No. 3 bearing after the pit was induced, it was noted that\nindividual bearing balls gave a discrete oscilloscope response from the Wilcoxon\naccelerometer output as each passed the etched damage location.\n\nThe oscilloscope\n\nwas being triggered by the Bently Nevada displacement probe output at once per\nshaft revolution and 8.7 "bursts" occurred per shaft rotation.\n\nFigure F-1 in Appendix F includes an oscilloscope photo of the accelerometer output data which shows the response for 8000 rpm and 50 pounds thrust load.\n\nThe\n\nsame figure shows the real time analysis output of the accelerometer over a frequency range from 240 Hz to 80,000 Hz.\n\nComparison of this figure with the same\n\ntest condition run before the fault was included (Fig. F-2)\ncharacter of the raw data and in content of the spectrum.\n\nshows the change in\nThe ball passing fre-\n\nquency so evident in the raw data of the damaged bearing does not appear in the\nlow frequency spectrum analysis of the accelerometer output shown as Fig. F-3.\n\nFurther examination indicated that these ball passing pulses were actually modulation of signals present at 28 K Hz and that the real time spectrum analyzer\ncould not detect this modulation as it shows up only as a change in amplitude of\nthe 28 K Hz "carrier."\n\nBecause the presence of the inner race defect was so evi-\n\ndent in the oscilloscope display it was felt that additional signal conditioning\nwould produce valuable fault-detection information.\n\n-20-\n\nA Spectral Dynamics Model SD 103 Dynamic Input Sine Converter was used to condition these accelerometer output signals to permit further analysis.\n\nThis unit\n\nis normally applied to convert pulse information to a sine wave of fixed amplitude which is phased to the input signal.\n\nWhen a complex signal is applied to\n\nit, the Sine Converter tries to produce sine waves for each input pulse so a\nspectrum analysis of its output contains significant frequencies. The gain setting of the Sine Converter was adjusted to show discrete components in the 700\nto 1400 Hz range.\n\nWith this analysis method, a spectrum analysis as shown on\n\nFig. F-4 was produced.\n\nThis shows the presence of modulating frequencies at\n\nball pass of the inner race defect.\n\nThe Sine Converter output for the undamaged\n\nbearing test did not show any inner race ball pass frequency component (Fig. F-5).\n\nIt was surmised that bearing fault information was being carried on high fre- J\nquency accelerometer outputs much like an AM communications signal.\n\nIt was also\n\nsurmised that a system capable of detecting the amplitude modulation could provide useful information to define the nature of a bearing fault and could, with\nadditional study, guide the decision to restrict operation of a failing bearing.\n\nThe source of the 28 K Hz signal "carrier" was of prime interest in evaluating\nthe overall system performance.\n\nA check of the race and ball resonance for this\n\nbearing gave the following values:\n\n(see Computations, Appendix D-4)\n:!st Critical\n\nInner Race (free)\n\n6.1 k Hz\n\nOuter Race (free)\n\n2.8 k Hz\n\nBall\n\n555 k Hz\n\nTreating the inner race as a free ring is quite far from reality as it is an\ninterference fit on the shaft, and in fact it seems that it should be treated as\na solid cylinder.\n\nThe outer race, however, has a clearance fit in its housing\n\nso the calculated resonance probably is quite good.\n\nThere was no recognized\n\nresponse in the 2800 Hz area which could be attributed to outer race resonance.\nResonance of the ball itself is far above the range of experimental analysis\nused.\n\nIt is concluded that the 28 K Hz response must be related to the mass of a ball\non its supporting contacts.\n\n-21-\n\nThe effects of varying test parameters upon this resonant response are shown on\nFigs. F-6 through F-20.\n\nNote that overall amplitudes from unconditioned data\n\nphotos for damaged bearing tests are much greater than the summation of analyzed\nspectra levels.\n\nThis occurs because the input data has a characteristic resonant\n\n"ring" shape for each impact which begins as a very high spike and decays logarithmically.\n\nThe analyzer is designed to process data which occur regularly so\n\nit produces an amplitude related to the average of the input response over a\ntime period.\n\nBecause the point of beginning of an individual spectrum analysis\n\nis not phased to the input data, Ensemble Averaging over a large number of spec-:\ntrum ensembles produces statistically better results.\n\nThis technique involves\n\nthe memory storage of the sum of a number of subsequent spectra which are thus\ndivided by the number stored.\n\nIn these data plots, either 32 or 64 spectra are\n\n"time averaged" to produce representative data.\n\nIncreasing thrust load produced increasing responses of 28 K Hz and at 55 K Hz\nfor the induced pit condition as shown by Figs. F-6 and F-7 for 8000 rpm.\n\nRef-\n\nerence to the spectrum traces for the undamaged bearing at the same loads\n(Figs. F-10 and F-11) shows that the 55 K Hz response is very sensitive to load\nwhile the 28 K Hz area is hardly:;affected.\n\nThis indicates that the 28 K Hz res-\n\nponse is a unique output which is greatly affected by bearing damage but :only\nweakly responsive to load and then only when damage is present.\n\nIt is shown in\n\nthe spectra analyses for the low frequency range to 2000 Hz (Fig. F48, F-9, F-12,\nF-13 and F-14) that the inner race fault frequency of 1156 Hz does not appear as\na significant signal under any test conditions.\n\nA review of the same test load cycle for 6000 rpm operation with the induced\ninner race fault is available from Figs. F-15, F-16 and F-17.\n\nThese spectra\n\nplots shown an even lesser response of the 28 K Hz resonance to variations in\nload.\n\nThe 25 percent reduction in bearing speed did not cause any change in the\n\nfrequency of the 28 K Hz response which further enforces the premise that it is\nan inherent response of this bearing.\n\nAgain the spectrum for the low frequency\n\nrange (Fig. F-18) shows that the damage indication is too slight to appear in the\ndirect accelerometer output.\n\nFigures F-19 and F-20 show the 50 pound thrust load\n\naccelerometer characteristics for the undamaged test of this bearing at 6000 rpm.\n\n-22-\n\nIn summary, it is concluded that response to the inner-race defect is as follows:\nEach ball impacts on the inner race "pit," causing the ball to resonate.\n\nSince\n\nthe bearing load is primarily a thrust load, each ball impact is quite similar\nin amplitude to its neighbors.\n\nAFBMA Class 7 bearings have close ball diameter\n\ncontrol so the resonant frequency value for each ball is very nearly the same.\nThe resonating of the balls is transmitted to the outer race and tothe bearing\nhousing through the film of oil between balls and race and between race and\nhousing bore.\n\nA housing accelerometer can then sense the vibration of the balls\n\nwith peak response occurring at each impact.\n\nFurther experimental evidence for this thesis can be obtained from the oscilloscope photo shown on Fig. F-1.\n\nNote that at approximately 45 rotational degrees\n\npast the minimum amplitude point of the shaft runout trace, there is a maximum\namplitude pulse.\n\nAt that time the inner race pit, a ball, and the radial Wilcoxon\n\naccelerometer were directly in line.\n\nApproximately 90 degrees later the accelero-\n\nmeter output reaches a minimum when the pit is impacting a ball in a plane perpendicular to the accelerometer centerline.\n\nAt a point another 90 degrees later\n\nthere is a second, minor peak as the pit is on the opposite side of the shaft\nfrom the accelerometer but in line with it.\n\nThere is a second minimum at the\n\nother out-of-plane impact and a maximum as the pit, ball and accelerometer again\nfall in line.\n\nNote that there are only 9 of the 15 balls involved in this cycle.\n\nThe next revolution involves a different set of 9 balls in slightly different\nlocations yet the response is essentially the same, so individual ball variations\ndo not seem to enter in.\n\nIt is concluded that impacts from an outer race defect would also excite the resonance demonstrated by these tests but would occur at the frequency of ball pass\nfor a single outer race location.\n\nIt is expected that the modulation would not\n\nshow the amplitude variation with inner race position but would instead be related to the location of the pit with respect to the accelerometer. This would\nmean that amplitudes might vary slowly as the outer race creeps in its mounting\nbore, and establishment of limits of vibration level would be more difficult.\n\nBy the same reasoning a ball fault would also cause resonant ringing at the discrete frequency of ball rotation, but it would have even greater possibility of\n\n-23-\n\nvariation in output.\n\nBalls in a ball bearing characteristically find a particu-\n\nlar plane of rotation for each operating condition of load or speed and it would\nbe possible that a fault would not contact either race for extended periods of\noperation.\n\nAs faults accumulated, however, the statistical opportunities of\n\ncontact increase and the deterioration of the bearing would become apparent.\n\nIt is also concluded that multiple damage indications would have no affect on\nthe ability to define bearing condition by this technique.\n\nThe raw data may\n\ntake on a more random appearance as more defect impacts occur, but narrow band\nfrequency analysis should resolve the repetition rates of the individual fault\nlocations.\n\nOther responses shown on accelerometer spectrum plots at 32 K Hz and 55K Hz have\nnot been recognized or related to specific component ringing.\n\nThe response at\n\n55 K Hz response varies strongly with thrust load so it could be used as a\nmeasure of system operating conditions.\n\nIt is conceivable that impending prob-\n\nlems would show up as an increasing thrust load (such as higher temperature due\nto lubricant starvation) and the charge in level of the 55 K component would\nsignify this.\n\nAll sensor outputs were scanned to find additional indicators of bearing fault\nbut none produced definition as clear as from the Wilcoxon accelerometer.\n\n-24-\n\nSECTION IV\n\nPROTOTYPE DIAGNOSTIC SYSTEM\n\nThe experimental determination of a bearing system resonance which was related\nto an induced bearing defect provides criteria which can be used for the detection and evaluation of bearing faults.\n\nThe availability of two discrete indica-\n\ntions permits the construction of a logic circuit which will give a fault indication only when both are present.\n\nThe overall signal level produced at 28 K Hz provides the first indicator of a\nbearing fault.\n\nThe thirty-to-one variation between levels produced for the\n\nsingle fault and for the bearing when new, permits good resoltuion of early\ndamage.\n\nAs this phenomenon is not speed or load dependent, this criteria applies\n\nto any installation of this bearing size.\n\nThe second criteria used is that modulation occurs at discrete frequencies depending upon the bearing speed and upon which component incurs the initial damage\nindication.\n\nAn inner race fault will produce ball contacts 8.7 times per shaft\n\nrevolution, and from a statistical basis will be the most likely initiation\npoint for fatigue faults.\n\nAn outer race ball track defect will produce 6.3\n\ncontacts per shaft revolution and it is expected that overall amplitudes will\nvary depending upon the relationship of defect and sensor location.\n\nA normal\n\nbearing installation will permit the outer race to creep slowly and acceleration\nlevels will be a peak when the defect is in the plane of the accelerometer and\nwill be somewhat lower when the defect is 90 degrees out of plane from the.sensor.\nA ball defect will produce modulation at 6.0 times per shaft revolution but has\nthe possibility of being quite erratic.\n\nIf the initial ball defect should be\n\nout of plane from the ball spin axis occurring when monitoring is done, this\nfault indication will not be present.\n\nThe electronic circuit developed is shown in block form on Fig. IV-1.\n\nHousing\n\nvibration from the bearing under test is converted to a charge signal by a securely\n\n-25-\n\nattached high frequency response accelerometer. The charge is detected by a\ncharge amplifier and a voltage proportional to housing acceleration is produced.\nThis voltage is amplified and presented to the input of the Bearing Fault Detector.\n\nOnly the information at the 28 K Hz resonance is of use so the input data\n\nis filtered to exclude all but the carrier and its sidebands.\nfilter is shown by the plot on Fig. IV-2.\n\nThe shape of this\n\nThe band pass filter produces a maxi-\n\nmum gain of 150 to the test point indicated as 28 K Hz out.\n\nAt this point, the signal has sufficient amplitude so that a simple diode detector can be used.\n\nThe detected signal is fed to the adjustable low frequency\n\nEnvelope Band Pass Filter and also to a low pass filter (integrator) to provide\na DC output identified as point A.\n\nThis DC level is proportional to the direct\n\nresponse at 28 K Hz.\n\nThe detected signal fed to the Envelope Band Pass Filter is available at the\ninstrument tap identified as Envelope Detected Output and can be viewed on an\noscilloscope and also be analyzed by a spectrum analyzer.\n\nThis signal contains\n\ninformation relating to the time-varying change in level of the 28 K Hz resonance.\nThe Envelope Band Pass Filter is designed as an adjustable filter with a constant\nQ of 50.\n\nThe center frequency can be adjusted by a front panel control over the\n\nfrequency range 700 to 1460 Hz (10 turn pot identified as Frequency Control).\nThe maximum gain for this filter is approximately 50.\n\nAn output after the filter\n\nis shown on Fig. IV-1 as Filtered Detected Output and can be monitored by an AC\nvolt meter.\n\nThis output is also at sudhvaalevel that:it caniibe.diode:-detected and\n\nintegrated to provide a DC output identified at Point B.\n\nThe Frequency Control pot is set based upon shaft speed to pass inner race defect,\nouter race defect, or ball defect frequency components.\n\nThe DC output of each detector circuit is fed to a comparator which has an adjustable trip level.\n\nFor a fault indication to occur the levels of both signals must\n\nbe sufficient to exceed the trip points.\n\nThe output of each comparator is applied\n\nto one input of a two input logic "AND" gate.\nif, and only if, both inputs are present.\n\nThis gate will produce an output\n\nThe output of the "AND" gate is con-\n\nnected to a power amplifier to operate the damage indicator lamp.\n\n-26-\n\nA photograph of the Bearing Fault Detector is included as Fig. IV-3.\n\nInternal defect limits settings for the Fault Detector were based upon output\nresponses from a small induced fault which simulates the first fatigue spall in\na bearing of this speed and load.\n\nIt must be noted that response at the sensor\n\nfrom a particular bearing defect depends upon the transmission path and the\nhousing configuration and mass.\n\nA damaged bearing indication is shown by the\n\nlighting of the Fault Indicator Lamp when the response at 28 K Hz is sufficiently\nhigh and also the level within the Envelope Band Pass Filter range is above the\ntrip point.\n\nOutput spectra plots made from tape recorded accelerometer data played through\nthe Bearing Fault Detector are shown in Appendix F as Figures F-21 through F-26.\nThese spectra are from the Envelope Detected Output tap and represent the\nfollowing conditions:\nFig. F-21\n\n8000 rpm 50 lb Thrust Load -
