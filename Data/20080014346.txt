In doing\nso, Binnie and SpaceShipOne captured the $10 million\nAnsari X PRIZE for Mojave Aerospace Ventures-a small,\ncutting-edge private enterprise-led by legendary aerospace\ndesigner Burt Rutan and finanbed by Microsoft co-founder\nPaul Allen.

Many of the new ideas are\nelegant technical solutions, like Burt Rutan\'s use of feathered\nwings on SpaceShipOne. Equally, if not more, important are\nthe innovative program management practices that come into\nplay when extremely small and motivated teams put their own\nmoney on the line to win a prize. Just as SpaceShipOne is not a\nreplacement for the Space Shuttle or other governmental human\nspace flight programs, prizes like those offered by the nonprofit\nX PRIZE Foundation will not, and likely cannot, replace\ngovernment design, development, or procurement methods.\nBut just as SpaceShipOne and its counterparts in the private\nsector can provide effective lessons and practical applications for\ngovernment programs, so too can program mangers at NASA\nand other government agencies take important cues from the\nteams competing for prizes.\nIn my two and a half years at the X PRIZE Foundation,\nI\'ve had the enormous pleasure of working with several such\nteams. The experience gives me a front-row seat from which to\nobserve breathtaking innovation. The individuals and groups\nthat are attracted to these prize competitions are a particularly\nfascinating subset of the human species: passionate, strongwilled, risk-taking, and imaginative.\nThe space industry would benefit from the involvementand\nenthusiasm of any one of this new class of steely-eyed missile\nmen and women. On their own initiative and with their own\nfunding, these pioneers put an enormous variety of concepts\nthrough the tests needed to expose each as a useful tool or a\ndead end.\nWith one of our space prizes successfully claimed, anotherthe Lunar Lander Challenge-just shy of being won, and the\nGoogle Lunar X PRIZE recently announced, we can already\nbegin to look at the progress of the teams and draw important\n\n.\n\n.. .\n- -\n\n...-_ .\n\n. . -\n\n-.\n\n\'\n\n-= .\n\n-\n\nI..\n\n-\n\n-\n\n- r:\n\n-I\n\n.- .. .~.. .\n.\n.\n._\n+=?+%if ...- .\n. -*\n\'-\n\n-..i-.\n-----.I-.-\n\n.\n\n,...\n\n.\n:.\n\n:+&+\n\n. : i . -\n\nconclusions. I won\'t presume to call them "lessons learned" as\nthe lessons from each still need to permeate the industry and\ninform decision making across the sector. Instead, I think the\nstruggles of each team have revealed some important lessons\nthat we need to learn.\n\nBuild, Test, Fly, Destroy, Repeat\nThe early days of rocketry and space exploration in the United\nStates were marked by incredibly rapid progress: a seemingly\nendless parade of firsts. Not coincidentally, this period also saw\nmore than its fair share of failure, especially in the infamous\n"kaputnik" days prior to the successful launch of Explorer.\nWithout a standard canon of known quantities to turn to,\nthe early pioneers of rocketry and space flight were forced\nto dream up new ideas that ranged from the elegant to the\nbizarre and to accept the fact that the price of radical progress\nis occasional failure.\nNowadays, rapid prototyping and testing have slowed, as\nwe rely more and more on the extensive knowledge pined by\nour predecessors and on the embarrassment of riches modern\nengineers get from computational modeling and computerassisted design. In many cases, this leads to much improved or\nphenomenally more efficient designs. It also, however, fosters\na culture so terrified of failure that we over-engineer and\noveranalyze everything, often tweaking designs for decades\nbefore a new system takes flight. (This is not a problem unique\nto rockets; the same phenomenon seems to have occurred in\nhigh-performancejets.) This is one reason why it was possible for\nPresident Kennedy to dream of the completion of the Mercury\nand Gemini missions and a successful landing on the moon in\nunder a decade, while returning to the moon may take nearly\ntwice as long.\nLacking access to the tremendous computational resources of\nthe national space program-and, just as importantly, removed\nfrom the harsh judgment of public shareholders or congressional\nappropriations committees-the\nhungry entrepreneurs who\n\nHigh above the Mojave desert, White Knight carries SpaceShipOne aloft for the\nfirst of its two Ansari X PRIZE-winning flights.\n\ncompete for our prizes tend not to display such fear of failure.\nInstead, most of them follow a rapid "build, test, fly" program.\nThey are willing to throw a handful of concepts against the wall\nand see what sticks. They often go from drawing on the back of a\nnapkin to firingengines or even flyingvehicles in amatter ofweeks\nor months, learning valuable lessons along the way. Indeed, our\nteams have repeatedly learned many of the most valuable lessons\nafter only a few moments ofworkingwith real hardware-lessons\nthat could never have been learned from a CAD drawing, like\nfinding the failuremodes of differentwelding practices or tracking\ndown the interference between an onboard camera and a GPS\nunit. As Paul Breed, the leader of a Northrop Grumman Lunar\nLander Challenge team (playfully called Unreasonable Rocket),\nis fond of saying, "In computer simulations the plumbing never\nleaks. In real life, it always does."\n\n"Not Invented Here" Leads to "Not Invented"\nAerospace engineers and professionals from other disciplines\ninvolved in this sector may be endowed with above-average\nintelligence-after all, what they do is rocket science. But they\nare still human and still liable to succumb to vanity and pride.\nThis can lead to a variety of actions that, while understandable,\nslow progress. All too often, members of this industry ignore\nsolutions provided by other sectors of the industry owing to\nignorance of those solutions, mistrust of their quality, or a simple\ndesire to promote their own handiwork over that of others.\nThough there are exceptions,the new class of entrepreneurial\ncompanies that compete for our prizes have thrown "not\ninvented here" out the window. Given that they directly compete\nfor millions of dollars in prize money and usually wager their\npersonal fortunes to fund their entries, one would expect them\nto guard their own products and ideas jealously, limiting the\nexchange of ideas.\nInstead, though, our teams consistently advise their\ncompetitors or distribute labor when teams share common\nrequirements. Many of the contestants in the Northrop\n\nGrumman Lunar Lander Challenge, for example, use a\npublic e-mail list called aRocket to share test information on\neverything from onboard cameras or guidance systems to\nspecific parts or propellant combinations to the complex and\ndetailed mathematics required to, say, characterize the moment\nof inertia of their rockets. The "build, test, fly" strategy these\nteams follow generally leads to a lot of new systems being tested\nto the point of failure; oftentimes, a team posts test results to\nthis public list within the hour, inviting others to share in the\nanalysis and benefit from their results.\nSimilarly, most of our teams have, by necessity, vigorously\npursued commercial off-the-shelf products. Lacking the time,\nbudget, or facilities to reinvent the wheel, they scour scrap\nyards, commercials retailers, and even their fellow teams\' shops\nfor parts that can be slotted into their design. They also show\na refreshing willingness to look outside the aerospace industry\nfor solutions. Teams have used off-the-shelf products like\nirrigation tubing or automotive parts as the basis for important\ncomponents of their vehicles. Parts and systems slated to go into\nhigh-performance racing cars or mass produced for consumers\nhave gone through impeccable design and quality assurance\nprocesses and offer economies of scale never before seen in the\ncommercial rocket industry. The massive catalog of a universal\nindustrial parts supplier like McMaster-Carr, whose Web page is\nbursting with valves, piping, and other parts, practically makes\nthese rocketeers giddy. After all, says Breed, the manufacture of\nrockets boils down to "just tanks and plumbing."\n\nSize Matters\nNASA and the traditional aerospace contractors generally work\nin teams that number in the hundreds, if not the thousands. Since\nthe days of Kelly Johnson\'s Skunk Works, though, the industry\nhas recognized the advantage of small groups of exceptionally\ntalented engineers working with minimal oversight.\nRegardless of how intelligent and innovative a manager is,\nit seems unlikely that any group of hundreds of contributors\n\nASK M A G A Z I N E 137\n\nON TEAMS THAT OFTEN NUMBER TEN OR FEWER, THE PEOPLE COMPETING FOR OUR\nPRIZES ARE ALL CONSTANTLY AWARE OF HOW CRITICAL THEY ARE TO THEIR TEAM.\n\ncould ever function as efficiently as a group like Armadillo\nAerospace-eight close friends who have worked side by side for\nyears and can practically finish each other\'s sentences. Such a\ngroup can spend most of its time on engineering or production,\nand little in meetings or coordinating labor.\n\nThere Is No Substitute for Passion\nWorking with teams seeking these prizes, I am struck by\none almost overwhelming advantage they have over many\ntraditional aerospace workers: incredible passion. For many of\nthem, the prize entries are the fulfillment of lifelong dreams.\nTheir vehicles are their hobbies, their keys to wealth, and their\nchildren, all wrapped into one. Team members as a rule cannot\nstop talking about their entries-and cannot stop working on\nthem. They dream about their rockets. They talk to their friends\nand coworkers about them. They blog about them. They happily\ngive up weekends and use up vacation days to find even more\ntime to work. "We\'re standing on the threshold of a dream," says\nNeil Milburn, vice president of Armadillo Aerospace. There is\nnot a 9-to-5 worker among them. Of course, NASA has its fair\nshare of motivated employees as well. But the commitment\nof these entrepreneurs, with so much of their personal lives\nwrapped up in their projects, borders on obsession.\nSome of this enthusiasm and passion comes from the\nlofty goals of the prize requirements; some, no doubt, comes\nfrom the thrill of competition. But I suspect their unbridled\nobsession comes mainly from the high degree of personal\ninvolvement and ownership each team member feels. In an\nera when the smaller aerospace boutiques of the 1960s have\nmerged into a few massive corporate giants, it is too easy for\nengineers, especially younger engineers, to feel like a small cog\nin a massive machine. On teams that often number ten or fewer,\nthe people competing for our prizes are all constantly aware of\nhow critical they are to their teams. They are intensely and\ndeservedly proud of this and work on their machines as though\ntheir lives depended on it. Their confidence in themselves frees\n\nthem to borrow solutions from others and leads to progress at\nincredible speeds.\n\nWe\'re. Entrepreneurial Space,\nand We\'re Here to Help\nThe creative, small, privately funded groups that find themselves\ncalled to our competitions possess, by necessity, a number\nof advantages that allow them to function on infinitesimal\nbudgets, by industry standards. Many of these advantages are\nprobably impossible to translate to efforts being undertaken by\nthe traditional members of the aerospace community. The good\nnews is that, despite the occasional playful bravado of some of\nthe more colorful characters involved in these competitions, all\nour teams are die-hard supporters of a robust space exploration\nprogram and will gladlydo their parts. As such, they can function\nas highly specialized components of the greater aerospace\nworkforce. These small, innovative teams can quickly and\ncheaply provide services to their larger brethren. Whether it is a\nNorthrop Grumman Lunar Lander Challenge team providing\na flying platform capable of carrying experimental sensors\non dozens of flights a week, or Ansari X PRIZE competitors\ncarrying scientific payloads and their human operators into\nthe blackness of space, or the eventual Google Lunar X PRIZE\nwinners testing systems and returning data that will support\nNASA\'s return to the moon, the entrepreneurial community is\npoised to help the national space program like never before.\n\nWILLIAM POMERANTZ has been the director of space projects\nat the X PRIZE Foundation since 2005.
