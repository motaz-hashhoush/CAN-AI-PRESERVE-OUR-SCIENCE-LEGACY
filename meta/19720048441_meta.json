The interferometer was built for the purpose of mapping discrete radio sources like the Crab Nebula, Cassiopeia A, and Cygnus A. It has two 8-ft parabolic antennas operating at 17.128 GHz. The maximum baseline of 100 m corresponds to a resolution of 35 sec of arc. A PDP-8 computer is incorporated in the system and is used for pointing, tracking, delay compensation, and real-time data analysis. The phase stability of the system was better than 10 deg over a period of 2 hours. Consistent fringe components were obtained from the Crab Nebula with a baseline set at 8 m.", "title": "The M.I.T.
