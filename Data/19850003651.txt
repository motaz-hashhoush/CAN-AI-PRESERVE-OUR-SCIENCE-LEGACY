Sammis\nUniversity of Southern California\nCenter for Earth Sciences\nUniversity Park\nLos Angeles, CA 90089-0741\n\nOctober, 1984\n\nNASA FINAL REPORT\n\nDuring the past year we completed our high-temperature creep studies in\northoenstatite under conditions of controlled oxygen fugacity. The results\nwere presented at the Fall annual American Geophysical Union meeting in\nDecember and are given in the Ph.D. thesis by A. Dehghan which is appended to\nthis report.\nThe most significant result was that creep was controlled by the\nextremely thin layer of SiO 2 which wetted the grain boundaries. Slight\nreduction of the (Mg, Fe)SiO 3 enstatite during hot-pressing produced\nmicroscopic particles of Fe and the thin film of intergranular Si02 . This\nresult highlights another complication in determining the flow properties of\niron-bearing silicates which constitute the bulk of terrestrial planets and\nmoons. The phenomenon which we have documented may be important in the\nductile formation of any extra-terrestrial body which formed in a reducing\nenvironment.\nDuring the past year we also began theoretical work on the rheology of\n"dirty" ice. This work involves micro-mechanical modeling of hardening\nphenomena due to contamination by a cosmic distribution of silicate particles.\nThe larger particles are being modeled using suspension theory. In order to\nhandle the distribution of particles sizes, we are treating the hardening as a\ncritical phenomenon, and using real-space renormalization group techniques.\nSmaller particles interact directly with the dislocations. Known as\n"particulate hardening", this effect has been extensively studied in metals.\nWe are using the results of these studies to assess the magnitude of such\nhardening in ice. We are similarly studying the defect chemistry of ice in\norder to assess the effects of chemical contamination by methane, ammonia, or\nother likely contaminants. Preliminary work on the ice problem is given in\nAppendix B.\n\nio._ .. \t\nMOPMEMMM\n\ns\n\n.\n\nAPPENDIX B\nPreliminary Work on the Rheology of "Dirty" Ice\nA. The Rheology of a Suspension of Silicate Particles in an Ice Matrix\nSilicate particles having diameters between 100 a and about .1 cm will be\ncarried in suspension in the flowing ice. Their effect on the effective\nviscosity can be evaluated using a marbles in molasses model. Larger\nparticles will settle out of suspension; smaller particles (smaller than the\ngrain size) can be expected to maka larger contributions to the effective\nviscosity through their interactions with the dislocations and grain\nboundaries as will be discussed in the following section.\nThe change in viscosity due to a distribution of-spherical particles all\nthe same size has been extensively studied. After correcting for\nnon-Newtonian, inertial, and nonhomogeneous suspension effects, Thomas (1965)\nshows that a wide variety of data for uniform suspensions can be fit by\n\n+ 0.00273 exp\n\nnr - 1 + 2.5# + 10.5# 2\n\n(16.6#)\t\n\n(1)\n\nwhere + is the concentration of spherical particles by volume. Equation (1)\ndescribes the data up to a concentration of 0 - 0.6, and is plotted in Figure\n1. In a more recent study using very uniform glass beads, Chong et al. (1971)\nobtained slightly stiffer resv1ts which they fit using the equation\n\nnr -\t\n\nF\t\nI1\nI\t\n\n+ i -\t\n\n1.25\t\n.605\t\n\n12\n\n1\t\n1\n\n(2)\n\nwhich is also plotted in Figure 1. Note that this expression is assymptotic\nto \xc2\xae - 0.605. The solids concentration at which the relative viscosity tends\nto become infinite is often denoted + and has been the subject of much study.\nChong et al., argue that 0 - . 605 for a truly monodispersed system (which\napproaches orthorhombic packing) and that the larger\t\nm\n\nfound by Thomas (1965)\n\nis the result of particle-size variations in those systems.\n\n.\n\nFrankel and Acrivos (1967) have shown that an assymptotic expression can be\nderived by only considering the fluid in the gap between points of closest\napproach:\n\n113\nas #/#..\xe2\x80\xa21\t\n\nnr = 9 (/ .)\t\n\n(3)\n\n8 1- 0 ^.) / 3\nIn this expression, 4a is the maximum attainable concentration ( which depends\nupon packing). In Figure 1, (3) has been fit to the Chong eta l. data\n(assuming Om = .605) and the Thomas data ( assuming + m = .625).\nMuch less work has been done on suspensions in which the particles are\nnot the same size. Based on their experimental observations for bidispersed\nsystems, Chong et al. ( 1971) suggest the following empirical relation\n2\n\nnr = 1+.075\t\n\n!.\n(4)\n\nMoshe ( 1979) suggested that ( 4) might be used for any particle size\ndistribution. He then discussed how # might be estimated for a given\n.\nparticle distribution. However, the only theoretical justification for\nassuming that is the only additional variable comes from the assymptotic\nexpression (3), which was derived with no empirical assumptions.\nNote that the relative viscosity of a mixed distribution is always less\nthan that for equal-sized spheres. Intuitively, this is because the smaller\nparticles can flow more easily around the larger particles; based on (4), it\nis because \xc2\xae. is larger for a mixed distribution because it can be more\nefficiently packed. Friedson and Stevenson (1983) make the important\nobservation that the viscosity of a suspension of mixed particle sizes can be\nbounded. The upper bound is given by the uniform sphere case (2) wt.ile the\n\n,r\t\n\n.i.\n\nlower bound is given by the simple expression (Roscoe, 1952)\n\n\xe2\x80\x942.5\n(5)\n\nnr - (1-0)\n\nThis expression may be derived by using Einstein\'s (1906) formula for dilute\nsuspensions (of arbitrary particle sizes)\nnr - 1 + 2.50\t\n\n(6)\n\nto calculate the effect of adding a small amount of larger and larger\nparticles in successive steps. At each step the fluid viscosity is taken to\nbe the viscosity resulting from all the previous steps. The reason this gives\na lower bound is that it ignores the interactions between particles, and these\ninteractions tend to increase the effective viscosity.\nThe theoretical challenge is to develop a model which can predict the\nrelative viscosity for a suspension at intermediate to high concentration\nhaving a prescribed particle size distribution (corresponding to the expected\ncosmic distribution). There is some empirical and theoretical guidance as to\nhow such a model might be formulated. At small concentrations the expression\nmust approach the Einstein equation (6) while at large concentrations it\nshould reflect the packing in some form such as the assymptotic result (3).\nAt intermediate concentration, an additional complication is the formation of\ntemporary aggregates which effectively "freeze" the liquid within them (Vand,\n1948). The result is a higher apparent concentration. Roscoe (1952) shows\nthat, ir the simplest case of uniform spheres, the lower boundary (5) becomes\n\xe2\x80\x942.5\nT1r @ (1-1.350)\t\n\n(7)\n\nwhich is also plotted in Figure 1.\nThe curves in Fig. 1 suggest that the stiffening of ice by suspended\nparticles may be successfully modeled as a critical phenomena where 0\n\n..\n\nV.\ncorresponds to the critical volume fraction. Indeed, the stiffening problem\nIs very similar to the freezing problem in which large patches of the liquid\nbecome ordered and stiffen as the critical temperature is approached from\nabove. In the suspension problem at hand, large patches become locked into\nclusters as the critcal volume fraction is approached. We plan to exploit\nthis similarity by formulating the suspension problem as "lattice gas"\n(Runnels, 1972) and using real space renormalization group theory to\ninvestigate the critcal volume fraction and behavior near this critical point\nfor an arbitrary particle distribution (Burkhard and VanLeeuwen, 1982; Domb\nand Green, 1976). We shall seek guidance in this approach from our colleague\nin the Mathematics Department at USC, Professor Marc Kac, who has contributed\nbasic mathematical research on critical phenomena.\nB. Effects of Fine-Grain Particles on Dislocation Motion\nWhen the particles are smaller than the grain size they effect the creep\nby directly influencing the microscopic flow mechanism. Baker (1978) and\nBaker and Gerberich (1^79) studied the creep properties of polycrystalline ice\ncontaining sand particles having diameters approximately 1/10 that of the\ngrain-size. They found two major effects: a) the particles suppressed\ngrain-growth normally associated with dynamic recrystallization and b) the\nparticles increased the effective activation energy (by a factor of three for\na 1% sand concentration). Baker and Gerberich (1979) tentatively ascribe\nthis increase to an internal stress mechanism. We would like to explore this\nand other mechanisms associated with dispersion hardening (Brown and Ham,\n1971). Friedson and Stevenson (1983) point out that the magnitude of such\neffects in icy satellites ultimately depends upon the small particle cut-off\nof the assumed cosmic particle distribution, and that this is poorly\n\n0\ni\n\nconstrained. Nevertheless, it should be informative to estimate the effect\nfor various assumed distributions in anticipation of such constraints.\nConversely, the prediction of unacceptably large viscosity increases night be\nused to constrain the particle distribution.\n\nC. Effects of Chemical Doping\nChemical doping usually effects the creep properties of a solid by\naltering its uefect structures. For ice, these are Bjerrum defects which are\nrelated to the proton arrangement. In reviewing the current state of\nknowledge regarding dislocation creep in ice, Poirier (1982) points out that a\ndislocation moving through the ice lattice with immobile disordered protons\ncannot move u--ithout creating Bjerrum defects which violate the vernal\xe2\x80\x94Fowler\nrules of hydrogen bonding (Glen, 1968). The dislocation moves by nucleating a\nkink pair where a Bjerrum defect makes the local proton configuration more\nfavorable. We propose to study the defect chemistry of ice, and how it might\nbe altered by the presence of ammonia, methane, and other likely contaminants.\nWe are fortunate to have Professor Kroger as a colleague at USC whose\ncollaboration in the defect chemistry should prove invaluable. Although\nnumerous experiments have been carried out, including doping with HF and NH3\n(Jones and Glen, 196 0 ), HC1 (Nakamura and Jones, 1970), HC1, HBr, NH4OH,\nNH4 F, NaF, KF, NaOH, H 2O 2 , and He (Nakamura and Jones, 1.973), HF (Mai, Perez,\nTatibouet, and Vassoille, 1978) and MCI (Riley, Noll, and Glen, 1978), with\nthe exception only of the latter work where there was a pronounced work\nhardening, the results are generally inconclusive. Of particular significance\nto the icy satellites is the observation that NH 3 hardens ice, although no\nconvincing reason has yet been found for this effect (Poirier, 1982). A\ndetailed analysis of these data should be undertaken.\n\nD. Flow Mechanisms Near the Brittle-Ductile Transition\nBecause the temperatures in the icy satellites are at most on the order\nof .57a (Ellsworth and Schubert, 1983), it is possible that tectonic\ndeformation (particularly near the surface) is not a fully ductile process.\nThis is certainly true of short-time processes such as cratering. Mike Ashby\nhas recently completed experimental studies on the brittle/ductile behavior of\nice at low loading rates and Lange and Ahrens (1983) have looked into the\nbrittle behavior of ice and ice-silicate mixtures at high loading rates. We\nwould also like to assess the importance of brittle and pseudo-ductile flow\nprocesses in the evolution of these bodies. One of us (CGS) spent the past\nyear on Sabbatical in Cambridge working with Professor Ashby, and will\ncontinue this collaboration by spending one month in Cambridge, summer 1985.\n\nAPPENDIX A\nHigh Temperature Deformation of Hot-Pressed\nPolycrystalline Orthoenstatite\n\nby\n\nA.
