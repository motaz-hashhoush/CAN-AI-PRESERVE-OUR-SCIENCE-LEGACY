In most cases studied, additional engines were necessary. Except at short ranges for which additional payload were carried in the tow plane, the productivity of the basic aircraft was degraded by a reduction in cruise speed necessitated by the glider drag. Excessive aspect ratios did not improve system performance because of the increase in glider wing weight. Powered gliders using a tow plane only for takeoff and climb had the potential for a major reduction in fuel consumption. Uncertainty of restrictive regulatory action and the apparently increased airborne investment per unit productivity are obstacles to commercial development.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19770011174, "id": "93b0d0e242c34b9ead6c7290e92f956e", "publicationDate": "1977-02-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19770011174.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19770011174/downloads/19770011174.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19770011174/downloads/19770011174.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19770011174/downloads/19770011174.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
