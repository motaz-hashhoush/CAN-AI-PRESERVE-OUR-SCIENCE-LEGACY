An exothermic heat\nsource includes a plurality of segments of exothermic\nmaterial stacked one upon another to produce a desired\n15 temperature profile when ignited. The exothermic\nmaterial segments are constructed in the form of an\nannular e lement having a recess opening which defines\nan open central core throughout the vertical axis of\nthe stacked exothermic material. The sample container\n20 is arranged within the core of the stacked exothermic\nheating material. Ignition means are spaced vertically\nalong the axis of the heating material to ignite the\nexothermic material at spaced points !;o provide total\nrapid burn and release of heat. To rapidly cool and\n25 quench the heat, a source of liquid carbon dioxide\nis provided which is conveyed through a conduit and\na metering orifice into a distribution chamber. A\npressure drop across the metering orifice is such that\nthe temperature and pressure of the liquid carbon\n30 dioxide is reduced to a point where the liquid carbon\ndioxide is solidified and gasified in the chamber.\nThe gasified carbon dioxide is dispersed around the\nexothermic heating material and the sample container\nfor rapidly doling the material sample. The gases\n35 from the cooking medium and heating reaction are\n\n1\n\n.. 3\nvented through a non-propulsive vent on the exterior \t\nof the module casing which may be exhausted on the\noutside of the rocket or other vehicle in which the\t\nexperiment is being carried such that no reactive\n5 forces are produced.\nA vary effective heating and cooling furnace\nis thus provided in which the temperature of a material\nsample may be brought to above 1200 degrees Centigrade\nand thereafter cooled to below 900 degrees Centigrade\n10 in a manner of a few minutes. This is particularly\nuseful in space experiments for processing foamed\nmetals such as cupper.\n\nj\n1\n\ni\n\n3\n\nr\n\nDescription of the Drawings\n\nThe construction designed to carry out the\n15 invention will be hereinafter described, together\nWith other features *_hereof.\nThe invention will be more readily understood from a reading of the Following specification\nand by reference to the accompanying drawing forming\n20 a part thereof, wherein an example of the invention\nis shown and wherein:\nFigure 1 is an elevation of a sounding rocket\nvehicle in which an exothermic furnace module constructed according to the present invention is\n25 utilized to carry out processing and experimentation\nof material samples in space;\nFigure 2 is a partially cutaway view\nillustrating exothermic heating apparatus constructed according to the present invention; and\n30\nFigure 3 is an elevation of exothermic\nheating apparatus constructed according to the\npresent invention with parts thereof shown in phantom\nlines to illustrate the cooling of the exothermic\n35 material and sample container.\n\nit\n\nz\nj\n14\n\n{\n\nf\n\n3[\n\nl\n\na\n\n-\n\n4 -\n\nDescription of a Preferred Embodiment\n\nReferring now in more detail to the drawings,\nappa.atus for heating material samples in a low gravity\nspace environment by means of an exothermic reaction\n5 is illustrated as including a casing having a\ngenerally closed interior and a sample support means\ncarried within the casing for supporting the sample.\nExothermic heating means A js provided for rapidly\nreleasing heat having an open core\n\nin which the\n\n10 sample is supported to be heated. Ignition means\n\nA\n\n\t\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\nactivates the exothermic material A to release the\nheat. After heating, quenching means C rapidly\nquenches the temperature of the sample material at\na desired cooling rate for controlled cooling.\nInsulation is carried within the casing surrounding\nthe exothermic heating means and the sample support.\nThe sample material is rapidly heated\' and cooled by\nmeans of a controlled temperature profile.\nIn reference to Figure 3, it can be seen\nthat the casing includes a cylindrical casing 10\nhaving a removable top 12 which may be secured to\ncasing 10 in any suitable manner such as by screws.\nWithin the interior of the casing, the means for\nsupporting a sample container 14 is provided in the\nform of a lower container support 16 and an upper\ncontainer support 18. The sample containet 14 is\nheld by its ends between the upper and lower sample\nsupports.\nThe exothermic heating means A includes a\nplurality of segments 20 of an exothermic material\nwhich are stacked one upon another to produce the\ndesired temperature profile for the heating process.\nWhen activated, the exothermic Material produces a\ncertain amount of heat depending on the number of\nsegments and hence amount of material whereby the\n\nm r\t\n\n}\t\n\n}\n\n- 5 temperature profile (temperature versus time) of the\nsample heating may be reliably controlled. The\nsegments may be made from any suitable exothermic\nmaterial such as iron oxide and aluminum which is\n\n5 mixed with water in powdered form 4md then cast in\nthe desired shape,\xe2\x80\x9e Each\' segment includes a central\nrecess 22 which defines open core 23 when the\nsegments are stacked one ppon another. The recess 22\nis defined by a first generally vertical surface 20a\n10 extending from a top surface 20b of the segment which\nterminates in a generally horizontal ledge surface 20c.\nA second generally vertical surface 20d extends from\nthe ledge surface 20c and terminates at a bottom\nsurface 20e of the segment. Thus, with the segments\n15 stacked one upon another, the continuous central core\nopening 23 is provided along the axis of the vertically stacked exothermic heating material in which\nthe sample container 14 and material sample contained\ntherein are received.\nIgnition means B includes an annular heating\n20\t\nelement 24 which is carried on a the ledge surface 20c\nof at least two of tae segments 20, as can best be\nseen in Figures 2 and 3. Electrical leads 26 connect\nthe heating elements 24 to an exterior voltage control\n25 source by means of which the furnace may be remotely\nactivated by energizing the heating elements 24 which,\nin turn, activate and ignite the exothermic material.\nAny conventional remote control may be utilized to\nenergize the heating elements. Heating elements are\n30 provided in number and spaced such that total burn of\nthe exothermic material is accomplished to release the\ntotal heat therefrom. Thermal couple leads coupled 28\nare operatively connected to the sample container 14\nto monitor the temperature of the container and sample\n35 by remote station in a conventional manner. By achiev-\n\n- 6\n\ning total burn of the exothermic material, control of\nthe temperature profile in the heating process is\nachieved.\n\n5\t\n\nCooling means C is illustrated in the ;Form\nof a source of a cooling fluid which is ?referably\n\nliquid carbon dioxid,^\xc2\xb0, carried externally of the casing\ni\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n{\n35\t\n\n10.\t Conduit means 32 conveys the cooling fluid from\nthe container, 30.\t A manifold 34 is connected to the\nconduit 32.\t A metering orifice 36 in flow relationship with the conduit 32 includes a restricted opening\nwhich causes the pressure and temperature of the cooling fluid passing through the orifice to drop whereby\nthe cooling fluid is solidified and gasif ied in manifold\n34.\t Distribution means 38 conveys the gasified coolant\nfor distribution to and around the exothermic heating\nmaterial A and the sample container 14. \t Heat is\nabsorbed by the solidified carbon dioxide which causes\nmore gas coolant to be released.\t By way of example,\nconduit 32 may be one-eighth of an inch tubing and\norifice 36 restricted to about .0017 of an inch.\nLiquid carbon dioxide in container 30 is pressurized\nto approximately 1000 psi.\t The pressure drops to\nabout 1 or 2 psi across the metering orifice whereby\nsolid and gaseous carbon dioxide are formed at\na temperature of about minus seventy five degrees\nCentigrade.\nThe segments 20 of exothermic material, are\nstacked upon a lower base 40 can the bottom of casing\n10.\t An upper retaining cap 42 is resiliently biased\ntoward base 40 such that the stack of segments 20 are\nresiliently held between base 40 and cap 42. \t For this\npurpose, a biasing spring 46 is provided at the top\nof the casing which urges the cap 42 and segments 20\nagainst the bottom base support 40.\t The cooling gas\ndifuses in and around exothermic material normally\n\n- 7 ..\nexiting the top through gap 44 betweou the upper\n\n5\n\n\'t\t\n\ncontainer support 18 and and cap 42.\t In,one experimentation, for example, foafied copper is processed\nin space aboard a sounding rocket vehicle by hea`..ing\ncarbon, copper oxide, aqd copper in container 14 to\nabout 1200 degrees Centigrade in approximately one\nminute.\t After the material reacts for approximately\n\nE\n`\n\n;k\n\nxi\n\ni\n\none minute, the temperature is quenched by cooling\n\n!\n\nfluid and gases to about 900 degrees Centigrade in\n10 one minute.\t The entire process takes less than\nfive minutes.\nit\n+t\nA solenoid valve 48 isprovided in the\nconduit 32 for contrc l ling the flow and amount of\n,\nr\n\xe2\x82\xac\n,cooling fluid from the source 30 and hence the cooling\n15 temperature profile: and rate.\t in space processing,\nthis may be done remotely by conventional means.#\nA non-propulsive vent 50 is carried by the\ncasing 10 which communicates with the interior of the\ncasing.\t The exhaust gases from the heating and cooling\ni\nk\n20 disperse through the heating material A and insulation\n52 "ad ex it through the opposite vent ports 54 and 56\n#k\nof vent 50.\t The vent ports 54 and 56 are connected by\nsuitable tubing to exterior ports 58 and 60, respect,F\nively, on the exterior of the rocket which nullify\nI\nr\n25 each other and whereby no reactive force is produced\nt\nE\non the vehicle.\nWhile a preferred embodiment of the invention\nhas been described using specific terms, such\nC\nt\ndescription is for illustrative purposes only, and it\n3^\n\n30\n\n,\n\nis to be understood that changes and variations may\n\'f\n\'\'t\nbe made without departing from the spirit or scopes\ns\nof the following claims.\n;t\nt\n\ny\n\n.`\n{\n\nt\nAr\n\nEXOTHSRMIC FURNACE MODULE\na\n\nAbstract of the Disclosure\nAn exothermic furnace module is disclosed\nfor processing materials in space which includes an\n\ninsulated casing (10) and\xc2\xb0a sample support (16), (18)\ncarried within the casing which supports a sample\ncontainer (1.4).
