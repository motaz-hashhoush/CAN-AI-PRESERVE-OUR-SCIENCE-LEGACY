Three major results were found: (1) Observed cases of compensation for changes in the direction of the moon are based on physiological rhythm with a period of about 25 hours which can persist for at least several days under constant conditions. (2) The zeitgeber for physiological rhythm may be either moonlight or some other factor associated with the tides. (3) If talitrids are long removed from environmental entrainment, either artifically or naturally, the internal rhythm no longer exerts an appreciable influence on the angle of lunar orientation; in such cases the system deteriorates into constant angle orientation, with an angle which is determined by the beach orgin, but may be modified by lighting conditions.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19720017445, "id": "a3f5ae65278b4e0880f702337bbd3dcb", "publicationName": "NASA, Washington  Animal Orientation and Navigation", "publicationDate": "1972-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 19720017412, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "Animal Orientation and Navigation", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PROCEEDINGS", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19720017445.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19720017445/downloads/19720017445.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19720017445/downloads/19720017445.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19720017445/downloads/19720017445.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
