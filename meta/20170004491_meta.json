This large system requires a large amount of intensive testing that will properly measure the capabilities of the system. Automating the test procedures would save the project money from human labor costs, as well as making the testing process more efficient. Therefore, the Exploration Systems Division (formerly the Electrical Engineering Division) at Kennedy Space Center (KSC) has recruited interns for the past two years to work alongside full-time engineers to develop these automated tests, as well as innovate upon the current automation process.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 20170004491, "id": "48ccce096e534aab98ad733e5b1933ac", "publicationDate": "2017-04-10T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 20170004495, "type": "SEE_ALSO", "title": "Spaceport Command and Control System Software Development", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20170004491.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20170004491/downloads/20170004491.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20170004491/downloads/20170004491.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20170004491/downloads/20170004491.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
