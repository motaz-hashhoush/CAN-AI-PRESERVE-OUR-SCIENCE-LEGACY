What many people do not know is that a product very similar to Geordi's glasses is available to assist people with vision conditions, and a NASA engineer's expertise contributed to its development. The JORDY(trademark) (Joint Optical Reflective Display) device, designed and manufactured by a privately-held medical device company known as Enhanced Vision, enables people with low vision to read, write, and watch television. Low vision, which includes macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, and glaucoma, describes eyesight that is 20/70 or worse, and cannot be fully corrected with conventional glasses.", "title": "Improving Vision", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-21T10:23:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-09-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20030099640, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20030099640, "id": "ddfa849d3283434fb6a17b9ea3da5014", "publicationName": "Spinoff 2003: 100 Years of Powered Flight", "publicationDate": "2003-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 20030099639, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "Spinoff 2003: 100 Years of Powered Flight", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20030099640.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20030099640/downloads/20030099640.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20030099640/downloads/20030099640.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20030099640/downloads/20030099640.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
