The human body has\nevolved over millions of years under the force of gravity. Every\nsystem in your body\xe2\x80\x94how your fingernails grow, how you\ndigest food, how you circulate blood\xe2\x80\x94has evolved to use gravity.\nThe reason your heart is not in the middle of your body,\nbut in the upper part of your body, is because of gravity. We take\nourselves as test subjects into space in an environment where\nthere is no gravity, and we get to observe what happens. All the\nsensors that tell your body how much water you should have are\nin your neck, and, when all that fluid shifts up to your neck,\nyour body thinks you have too much water. In space, astronauts\nfunction with about 30 percent less water than they do here on\nthe ground. That\xe2\x80\x99s just one of the amazing changes that takes\nplace in the human body. As an astronaut, you get to see this\nhappen to your body, to see your body struggle with it, and then,\nin just a matter of days, you get to see your body adapt and live\nand flourish in this whole new environment.\nThis was an opportunity that I could not even imagine initially.\nI could dream about it when I was in college getting a chemical engineering degree and then later getting a doctorate degree in chemistry.\nI had a dream to go in space and to be able to experience\nthis and be able to make these kinds of studies and observations.\nBut I only hoped; I didn\xe2\x80\x99t think it would actually happen. When it\ndid, back in 1992, it was certainly a dream come true. When I\nfinally had the opportunity to fly in space in 1995 for the first time,\nit was just the most incredible thing I have ever experienced.\n\n119\n\n22785-looking back book final 2\n\n11/20/02\n\n1:13 PM\n\nPage 120\n\nLooking Backward, Looking Forward\n\nNow most people ask me, they say, \xe2\x80\x9cWell, what is your\nspecialty as an astronaut?\xe2\x80\x9d Well, the science astronauts, the mission specialist astronauts, don\xe2\x80\x99t actually have a specialty. We do\nour science vicariously through the other principal investigators\nthat work year after year, dedicating themselves to designing\nexperiments, to asking the critical questions that the astronauts\ncan then answer when they\xe2\x80\x99re up in space.\nOne of these experiments that I got to fly with back in\n1995 was the bioreactor. This is an incredible experiment and\nincredible equipment. What it allows you to do is grow not just\ncells, not just a layer of cells in a petri dish, but to grow human\ntissue outside the human body. I had the opportunity to fly with\nthe first bioreactor of this new generation in 1995 and watch\ncolon cancer tissue\xe2\x80\x94not cells, but tissue\xe2\x80\x94grow before my eyes.\nCharlie Walker discussed the challenges of commercializing\ntechnology. Since his firsthand experience, I have been able to\nwork with a venture capital firm which has decided to invest in\nthis technology. There is a market need out there that can compensate for the high cost and the limited access of space, and we\nbelieve we have a winner here.\nIt is just an amazing opportunity, as an astronaut, to be a part\nof both flying the experiments in space and of helping commercial\ncompanies identify the opportunities that space brings. This company is trying to make a liver-assist device. Right now if you have\nliver failure, you have two choices: you either get a transplant or you\ndie. There is nothing else out there right now. But with the bioreactor\nthat can grow tissues that function like the tissues in our body, we\nbelieve we can make a device that can save millions of lives. At the\n\n120\n\n22785-looking back book final 2\n\n11/20/02\n\n1:13 PM\n\nPage 121\n\nScience in Orbit\xe2\x80\x94Mary Ellen Weber\n\nheart of it, one of the key elements of that is space.\nAnother feature of space is that it is a very quiescent environment, which allows us to obtain structures of proteins and\ndesign new drugs. This is not a pipedream. This is something\nthat is happening and has been going on for a decade. There\xe2\x80\x99s a\nnew flu medication coming out that is targeted to a very specific\nflu enzyme that keeps any flu virus from attacking your body,\nand, because we know the protein structure, we\xe2\x80\x99re able to design\nthis drug with very limited side effects.\nThis is what is possible when you have a whole new environment. These are the possibilities of science and space. We\nhave just begun to tap into this with weeklong flights or two-week\nflights, and we are only beginning to chip away at some of these\nquestions. With the Space Station now, 365 days out of the year\nwe have an opportunity to enter into a whole new era of space\nscience\xe2\x80\x94not just understanding space, but seeing how human\nbodies, proteins, and tissues react and grow in space.\nI am so proud to be a part of this space program, so proud\nto be a part of something bigger than all of us. For thousands of\nyears, people looked up at the sky and tried to imagine what was\nout there, what were those points of light? They made up stories\nabout astrological figures. They just couldn\xe2\x80\x99t imagine it all. We\nare so fortunate in these past forty years to be alive at the time\nwhen we are just beginning to get the answers. It\xe2\x80\x99s not only\namazing to be an astronaut, it\xe2\x80\x99s an amazing time to be alive.\nWith the sacrifices and the commitments of so many people in\nthis country, we will indeed propel our civilization into this next\nera of space exploration.\n\n121\n\n22785-looking back book final 2\n\n11/20/02\n\n1:13 PM\n\nPage 122\n\n'
