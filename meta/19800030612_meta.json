The remainder of the Spacelab ground operational cycle will be spent in the Operations and Checkout Building where the Spacelab-unique facilities and GSE are located. KSC, as the Spacelab operations center, will be responsible for continuing assessment of Spacelab hardware utilization, based on mission requirements and program hardware.", "title": "Spacelab ground operations", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PROCEEDINGS", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-10T10:08:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19800030612, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Dickinson, J.
