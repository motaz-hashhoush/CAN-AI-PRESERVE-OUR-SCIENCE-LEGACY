b'PrimeSupplier Cross-Program Impact Analysis and Supplier\nStability Indicator Simulation Model\nThis application has potential uses in supply-chain and enterprise-resource planning software.\nJohn F. Kennedy Space Center, Florida\nPrimeSupplier, a supplier cross-program and element-impact simulation\nmodel, with supplier solvency indicator\n(SSI), has been developed so that the\nshuttle program can see early indicators of supplier and product line stability, while identifying the various elements and/or programs that have a\nparticular supplier or product designed into the system. The model calculates two categories of benchmarks\nto determine the SSI, with one category focusing on agency programmatic\ndata and the other focusing on a supplier\xe2\x80\x99s financial liquidity.\nTo expand further on programmatic\ndata, excessive time gaps between manufacturing, repair, and/or failure\nanalysis requirements [and subsequent\npurchase orders supporting the logistics purchase requests, established by\nthe project elements through Logistics\nSupportability Analysis (LSA), which\nare for flight hardware (personal property) only] focus on hardware meantime-between failure, manufacturing\nlead time, quantity per assembly, and\nsystem effectiveness. Procurement\nminimum buy quantities, Federal Acquisition Regulations (FARs), and International Traffic and Arms Regulation (ITAR) also influence, and\nsometimes extend, this time-gap\nexposure for manufacturing product,\nthus leaving the supplier and subse-\n\nquent second- and third-tier suppliers\nvulnerable to financial instability.\nThis results in either poor product\nquality, or in a supplier-induced product discontinuance.\nTo understand this time-gap exposure,\nthe last supplier product or service requirement need date, and first expected\nneed dates, are documented in number\nof days for all three supplier offerings of\nmanufacturing, repair, or failure analysis.\nEach functional capability of manufacturing, repair, and failure analysis is\nweighted slightly differently, with manufacturing having a heavier weight than repair, and repair would have a heavier\nweight than failure analysis.\nThe programmatic data feeding into\nthe weighting calculations are collected\nfrom internal logistics support analysis\ndata, like Line Replaceable Unit Probability of Sufficiency (LRUPOS), meantime-between-failure, and repair generation rate forecasts, as well as last supplier\ncapability need dates and first capability\nneed dates that are all reported from the\nNASA project elements to the Program\nOffice. Supplier capabilities include:\nmanufacturing, repair and sustaining\nengineering, failure analysis and teardown, and test and evaluation. Other\nprogrammatic weighting factors include: procurement data, contract value,\na supplier\xe2\x80\x99s percentage distribution of\nNASA business, and procurement-order\n\ntime-gap exposure. The financial benchmarks include liquidity performance\nmeasures, such as net profit margin, current ratio (current assets over current liabilities), and price earnings ratio.\nThese financial indicators are all compared against industry standards with\nvarious business-centric weighting factors, and could be automated with a realtime data feed.\nPrimeSupplier was developed to help\nNASA smoothly transition design, manufacturing, and repair operations\nfrom the Shuttle program to the Constellation program, without disruption\nin the industrial supply base. Complicating this effort are today\xe2\x80\x99s economic conditions that have created unprecedented\nvolatility within the country\xe2\x80\x99s industrial\nsupply base, negatively affecting quality\nand ability to deliver. PrimeSupplier\nhelps organizations identify at-risk suppliers by providing a holistic assessment\nof suppliers\xe2\x80\x99 total economic stability accounting for programmatic and enterprise-wide demands and general economic conditions.\nThis work was done by Michael Galluzzi\nof Kennedy Space Center.

The goal of the effort is\nnot only to help the human supervisor\nmonitor and control the state of the\nrobot, but also to improve the efficiency\n\n30\n\nof the robot by allowing the supervisor to\n\xe2\x80\x9cwork ahead.\xe2\x80\x9d The intelligent assistant is\nan integrated combination of an artificial-intelligence planner and a monitor\nof states of both the human supervisor\nand the remote robot. The novelty of the\nsystem lies in the way it uses the planner\nto reason about the states at both ends of\nthe time delay.\nTo enable the human supervisor to\nwork ahead of the robot, the planner and\nexecutive parts of the artificial-intelli-\n\ngence system must comprehend that execution of a task becomes split into two\nstages: that of the \xe2\x80\x9cleader\xe2\x80\x9d (the human supervisor) and that of the \xe2\x80\x9cfollower\xe2\x80\x9d (the\nrobot). Although a task is not truly complete until done by both the leader and\nthe follower, it is nevertheless essential for\nthe planner and executive parts of the artificial-intelligence system to work on the\nassumption that the follower will indeed\nfollow, until this assumption is violated.\nViolations can occur (1) when the human\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, September 2009\n\nsupervisor intentionally or unintentionally deviates from activities previously\nplanned in coordination with robot activities directed toward a goal, (2) the robot\nfails to execute a command as directed or\nfails to do anything else required of it\nwithin a maximum allowable time, or (3)\nthe robot environment changes or is progressively revealed to be significantly different from what was previously assumed.\nThe planner part of the intelligent assistant must respond gracefully to such\nviolations and notify the human supervisor. Graceful response must include replanning, for which it is necessary to\ncause the state model to revert to the\n\nmost recent known state of the robot. In\nre-planning, it is also necessary to recognize which goals have been reached so\nas not to again expand and schedule the\nconstituent tasks involved in reaching\nthose goals.\nThe purpose served by the assistant is\nto provide advice to the human supervisor about current and future activities,\nderived from a sequence of high-level\ngoals to be achieved. To do this, the assistant must simultaneously monitor and\nreact to various data sources, including\n(1) actions taken by the supervisor, including commands being issued by the\nsupervisor to the robot; (2) actions\n\ntaken by the robot as reported with\ndelay; (3) the environment of the robot\nas currently perceived with time delay;\nand (4) the current sequence of goals.\nAs any of these change, the assistant\nmust respond appropriately, detecting\nboth normal completion of tasks and exceptional conditions.\nThis work was done by Mark Johnston and\nKenneth Rabe of Caltech for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet\nPropulsion Laboratory.\nThe software used in this innovation is\navailable for commercial licensing.

Latency in such systems is\ndue to the sum of the finite time required for information processing and\ncommunication within and between sensors, software, and displays. Even though\nthe latencies intrinsic to each individual\nhardware, software, and communication\ncomponent can be minimized (or theoretically eliminated) by speeding up internal computation and transmission\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, September 2009\n\nspeeds, time delays due to the integration of the overall system will persist.\nThese \xe2\x80\x9cintegration\xe2\x80\x9d delays arise when\ndata produced or processed by earlier\ncomponents or stages in a system pathway sit idle, waiting to be accessed by\nsubsequent components. Such idle\ntimes can be sizeable when compared\nwith latency of individual system components and can also be variable in duration because of insufficient synchrony\nbetween events in the data path. This development is intended specifically to reduce the magnitude and variability of\nidle-time type delays and thus enable the\n\nminimization and stabilization of overall\nlatency in the complete VE (or other\ncomputer) system.\nThis work was done by Bernard D. Adelstein and Stephen R. Ellis of Ames Research\nCenter and Michael I. Hill of San Jose State\nUniversity Foundation.
