Rotatably mounted within the housing is a C-shaped tool body carrying a set of clamping rolls, two support rolls, and an edged cutting roll (64). The support rolls are disposed to one side of the axis of a pipe and the cutting roll is disposed to the other side of a pipe axis so that these rolls contact a pipe at three circumferential points. Cutter advancing apparatus advance the cutting roll toward the support rollers. The support rolls and cutting roll are rotatable independently  of the C-shaped housing. A one way ratchet mechanism disposed between the C-shaped housing and the C-shaped tool body permits operation by movement in one rotational direction about the pipe axis.", "title": "Open ended tubing cutters", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-04T15:01:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19820018796, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Girala, A.
