Each group of bits is\nfollowed by a data pause which will last a specified\nnumber of milliseconds. The printer prints a black\ndot on the thermally sensitive paper for each digital\n"one" received and prints nothing for each digital\n"zero" it receives. The first data bit per group is\nplaced at the left edge of the paper and each succeeding bit is placed a specified distance to the right\nof the preceding dot position on the paper.\nThe thermal print head is composed of the same\nnumber of printing elements as there are bits per\ngroup. These print elements are arranged in a single\nline oriented across the specified width of the paper.\nElectrically, these print elements are energized in convenient subgroups. Each element in a subgroup has a\ncommon electrical terminal with other elements in the\nsubgroup, and this common terminal is grounded by a\nsolid state switch when it is the proper time for one\nor more of the elements in the subgroup to be heated\nin accordance with the incoming signal. The other\nterminal of each thermal element is connected via the\ngate terminal, a silicon-controlled rectifier (SCR), to a\nsolid state shift-register stage which momentarily\nmemorizes the incoming serial digital data. The shift\nregister can memorize data for several subgroups of\nthermal elements; so at the time it is interrogated, it\ncontains data for several subgroups of thermal\nelements.\nA dc voltage is applied continuously to the anode\nof the SCR. If the cathode of the SCR is grounded\nant4\n\n;r thnr k a "rin p "\n\nn th p cbft rp aiot p r ctate tt\n\nwhich the gate of the SCR is connected, the SCR will\nconduct. A print pulse is routed through an "AND"\ngate along with the grounder signal to the base of\nthe grounder transistor. The print pulse turns on the\ngrounder for an appropriate number of milliseconds.\nSince one side of a thermal printing element is connected to the cathode of the SCR, current will pass\nthrough the thermal element to the common electrical\nterminal for the group if the common is grounded by\nthe grounder transistor at that time.\nIf there is a "zero" in the shift register stage to\nwhich the gate of the SCR is connected, the SCR will\nnot conduct when the print pulse turns on the\ngrounder transistor and, consequently, no current will\nflow in the thermal element connected to the SCR\ncathode.\nThe roll or fan-fold paper coated with a thermally\nsensitive dye is stored in or near the teleprinter\nassembly. The paper is routed between a pressure\nroller and the thermal head assembly. The paper is\nthen pulled around the pressure roller as they both\nturn in discrete angular steps. The paper then passes\nthrough guides behind a preview window to a slot in\nthe front panel where it exits for viewing by the\nobserver.\n\nNote:\nInquiries concerning this invention may be directed\nto:\nTechnology Utilization Officer\nManned Spacecraft Center\nHouston, Texas 77058\nReference: R67-l0572 .\n.--- ----(continued overleaf)\n\n\t\nMW\n\nThis document was prepared under the sponsorship of the National\nAeronautics and Space Administration.
