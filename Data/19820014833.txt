The SPS transportation\ncosts represent a major portion\nof program\nfunding\nrequirements\nand therefore\nrequire a. most\ncost-effective\napproach toward LEO-G EO transfer.\n\'.\n\nOrbital transfer vehicle propulsion options include both chemical (COTV)\nand electrical (EOTV)\noptions. The chemical options evaluated included single- and two-stage liquid oxygen/liquid\nhydrogen\npropulsive\nelements. The electric propulsion options considered alternate power sources (i.e., silicon\n\n,:\n\nT\n\ni\n\nor gallium aluminum\narsenide solar arrays), propellant\ntype (mercury,\nargon, cesium, etc.), low and\nhigh\ncurrent\ndensity\nthrusters,\nmethods of maintaining\nattitude\nhold during\nperiods\nof shadow\n(chemical\nor electric),\nand programmatic\nimpact of LEO-GEO\ntrip time. The proposed\nEOTV\nconstruction\nmethod\nis similar to that of the SPS and, by the addition\nserve as a demonstration\nor precursor satellite option.\ncrew\n\nThe results of the studies to date have led to the tentative\nand priorit.y cargo transfer (the COTV is refueled in GEO\n\nof a transmitting\n\nantenna,\n\nmay\n\nselection of a single-stage COTV for\nfor return to LEO). The size of the\n\npropulsive\nelement\nis dictated\nby the estimated\ncrew transfer\nrequirement.\nAn EOTV\nconcept\nis\nfavored for cargo transfer because of the more favorable orbital burden factor over chemical systems.\nAlthough\nit is highly desirable to maintain\na maximum\ndegree of commonality\nbetween the SPS and\nEOTV,\nthe gallium arsenide solar array is favored over the silicon array because of its self-annealing\ncharacteristics\nof radiation\ndamage encountered\nduring multiple\ntransitions\nthrough the Van Allen\nradiation belt.\nTransportation\nsystem operations are depicted\nin Figure 1.

At the LEO base, the crew\nmodule is removed from the Shuttle\ncargo bay and mated to a COTV for transfer for GEO. Upon\narrival at GEO, the SPS construction\ncargo is transferred from the EOTV to the SPS construction\nbase\nby IOTV.\nThe COTV with crew module docks to the construction\nbase to effect crew transfer and\nCOTV\nrefueling for return flight to LEO. Crew consumables and resupply propellants are transported\nto GEO by the EOTV.\nTransportation\nrequirements\nare dominated\nby the vast quantity\nof materials\nto be transported\nto LEO and GEO (Figure 2). The average annual mass to orbit is in excess of 100 million kilograms,\nwith over 100 personnel transfer flights per year.\n\nSPS CONSTRUCTION\n...B._\n__,_\n\n"_\n_,q_\n\nf_\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n._ _,._\n\nFACILITY\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2PROPELLANT\nTRANSFER\n\n400\n\n_ _ REFUEL\n\\\\\nr\n\nEOTV\n\nf_\n\n"\n\n_lk\'_\n\nI_ATOED\n\n/\n\n_--\n\n)00\n/\n\nCACS\n\nN\nLEO\n\nt\n\nSTATION\n\n100\n\xe2\x80\xa2 PROPELLANT\nTRANSFER\n\nCREW\nDELIVERY\n** \'2 ./\n\n--7--_\n_. ,_#.,,_,,_\nJr\n\n_.."_/_"\'_ //\nSPS-HLLV\n\n,OTV\n_m_\n\n"_CONSTRUCTION\n\nPAYLOAD\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 CREW EXPENDABLES\n\xe2\x80\xa2 POTV PROPELLANT\n\nIb\nH_\n\nl_\nPROGRAM\n\nFigure 1.

However, the major impact is realized in the smaller propulsive stage size and the overall\nreduction in orbital operations requirements.\n7""\n\nIndividual propellant tanks are indicated for the LO 2 and LH 2 in this configuration because of\nuncertainties at this time in attitude control requirements. With further study, it may be advantageous\nto provide a common bulkhead tank as in the case of the Saturn S-II stage and locate the ACS at the\nmating station of the POTV and personnel module or in the aft engine compartments--space\npermitting.\nThe POTV utilizes two advanced space engines (ASE), which are similar in operation to the\nSpace Shuttle main engine. The engine is of high performance with a staged combustion cycle capable\nof idle-mode operation. The engine employs autogeneous pressurization and low inlet NPSH\noperation. A two-position nozzle is used to minimize packaging length requirements.\nSince the POTV concept utilizes an on-orbit maintenance/refueling\napproach, an on-board\nsystem capable of identifying/correcting potential subsystem problems to minimize/eliminate on-orbit\ncheckout operations is postulated.\n\n;..\n\nThe EOTV concept (Figure 4) is based on the same construction principles of the Rockwell\nreference satellite. The commonality of the structural configuration and_c0nstruction proc_esses\nwith\nthe satellite design is evident. The structural bay width ot 70U m (solar array width of 650 m) is the\nsame as that of the satellite. The structural bay length is reduced from 800 to 750 m for compatibility\nwith the lower voltaqe reauirement of the EOTV.\n\n_{\n\nThe solar array voltage must be as high as Possible to reduce wiring weight penalties and to\nprovide high thruster performance, yet power loss by current leakage through the surrounding plasma\nmust be minimized. At the pr\'oposed LEO staging base, with very large solar arrays and high efficiency\ncells, an upper voltaae limit of 2000 volts is Oostulated. These considerations lead to the selection of a\ntwo-bay\nconfiguration\nwith structural dimensions of 700mx\n150Om\n(solar blanket size\n650 m x 1400 m) with a total power output of 309 mw (includes 6% line losses).\n\n-..\n\n\' "T\n\n"_\n\n),_\n\n;:.\n\nPrimary assumptions in EOTV sizing are given in Table 1.
