Shown above is one commercial implementation of the PFG. [See the bottom of\npage A1 .]\n\nAbout the NASA\nTechnology Utilization Program\nThe National Aeronaut ics and Space Act of 1958, which established NASA\nand the United States c ivil ian space program, requires that " The\nAdm inistration shall provide for the widest practicable and appropriate\ndissemination of information concerning its activities and the results thereof. "\nTo help carry out this objective, NASA\'s Technology Uti lization (TU)\nProgram was established in 1962. Now, as an element of NASA\'s Technology\nUtilization and Industry Affairs Division , this program offers a variety of\nvaluable services to help transfer aerospace technology to nonaerospace\napplications, thus assuring American taxpayers maximum return on their\ninvestment in space research ; thousands of spinoffs of NASA research have\nalready occurred in virtually every area of our economy.\nThe TU program has worked for engineers, scientists , technicians , and\nbusinessmen ; and it can work for you .\n\nNASA Tech Briefs\n\nTech Briefs is published quarterly and is free to engineers in U.S. industry\nand to other domestic technology transfer agents. It is both a currentawareness medium and a problem-solving tool. Potential products . ..\nindustrial processes . .. basic and applied research .. . shop and lab\ntechniques ... computer software ... new sources of technical data ...\nconcepts .. . can be found here. The short section on New Product Ideas\nhighlights a few of the potential new products contained in th is issue. The\nremainder of the volume is organized by technical category to help you\nquickly review new developments in your areas of interest. Finally, a subject\nindex makes each issue a convenient reference file .\n\nFurther Information\non Innovations\n\nAlthough some new technology announcements are complete in\nthemselves, most are backed up by Technical Support Packages (TSP\'s).\nTSP \'s are available without charge and may be ordered by simply completing\na TSP Request Card found at the back of this volume. Further information on\nsome innovations is available for a nominal fee from other sources, as\nindicated. In addition , Technology Utilization Officers at NASA Field Centers\nwil l often be able to lend necessary guidance and assistance .\n\nPatent Licenses\n\nPatents have been issued to NASA on some of the inventions described,\nand patent applications have been submitted on others . Each announcement\nindicates patent status and availability of patent licenses if applicable.\n\nOther Technology\nUtilization Services\n\nTo assist engineers , industrial researchers , business executives,\nGovernment officials , and other potential users in applying space technology\nto their problems, NASA sponsors Industrial Applications Centers . Their\nservices are described on page A7 . In addition , an extensive library of\ncomputer programs is available through COSMIC, the Technology Utilization\nProgram \'s outlet for NASA-developed software .\n\nApplications Program\n\nNASA conducts appl ications engineering projects to help solve publicsector problems in such areas as safety, health , transportation , and\nenvironmental protection . Two applications teams , staffed by professionals\nfrom a variety of disciplines, assist in th is effort by working with Federal\nagencies and health organizations to identify critical problems amenable to\nsolution by the application of existing NASA technology.\n\nReader Feedback\n\nWe hope you find the information in NASA Tech Briefs useful.

The short circuit temporarily\nturns off the drive to the output tran\xc2\xb7\nsistors. In effect. the short circuit\nchanges the width of the drive pulses.\nthereby regulating the output voltage.\nThe new voltage regulator isolates\nsignals from the power-switching converter without the use of complex circuitry or optical couplers. The only addition is an extra secondary winding on the\nexisting interstage transformer. Error\nsignals short-circuit the new winding\nand inhibit converter action. A resistor in\nseries with the primary winding limits the\nshort-circuit current to prevent damage\nto circuit components.\nIn the circuit (see figure). a signal\nrepresenting the instantaneous voltage\nat the 12-volt regulated output is sampled and applied through a resistor network to the inverting input of an error\namplifier. A nonvarying reference voltage established by a Zener diode is applied to the non inverting input of the error amplifier.

However.\nmicrovolt changes in the sampled\nvoltage - either upward or downward\n- produce significant shifts in the error\namplifier dc output level.

The ramp-voltage input to the comparator is generated in the\nfollowing way: A constant current is supplied to the capacitor CR by the\nconstant-current diode Dcc .

The circuit consists of a PROM-based microprogramed\ncontrol sequencer, which drives a group\nof diode switches to select one of eight\ntuning capacitors in an L-C oscillator.\nA synchronizing pulse is used to clock\nthe various mode-control inputs and a\n"next address" into the 74L8377 latch\nshown in the circuit diagram. The outputs of the latch then become an address for the PROM, and the PROM outputs DOS - 007 form a 3-bit code to determine the desired frequency for the\noscillator. The 3-bit code is further decoded in the 748138 1-of-8 decoder.\nOnly one output from the 748138 is active at a time, and the active output provides a current sink for the PIN diode\nswitch connected to it. All other diodes\nin the array are cut off, and only one tuning capacitor is active at a time, except\nfor parasitic effects.\nThe control inputs perform the following functions:\n-The WIDE/NARROW switch selects\neither a wideband sweep (Le., large :ieparation between frequencies) or a\nnarrowband sweep (Le., small deviations close to the undeviated carrier).\n-The MANUAUAUTO switch allows an\noperator to take control of the system\nand select anyone of the eight frequencies using the thumbwheel switch.\n-The DEFAULT/NORMAL input is provided to allow removal of the control\nswitches and thumbwheel switch by\ndisconnecting a connector. The connector provides a return to ground for\nthe As input to the PROM . When disconnected from the control switches,\nthe circuit defaults to an automatic\nwideband sweep mode.\nThe contents of the TBP18S42 PROM\nare determined by the desired sequence\nof frequencies. Bits 001 - 003 form\nthe memory address of the next desired\nfrequency. Bits DOS - 007 are an encoded version of the current desired frequency.

The device accommodates 246 cables containing a total of\n758 conductors and allows the turntable\nto rotate through an arc of 320\xc2\xb0 (see\nfigure). At the extremes of rotation\n( \xc2\xb1 160 0), the cables are loose enough\nthat they are not pulled taut and overstressed. At the halfway point (0\xc2\xb0), the\ncables are not so loose that they become entangled.\nThe cables are held in a hollow shaft 5\ninches (12.7 cm) in diameter and 18 inches (45.7 cm) long. At the rotating end\nof the shaft, the cables are distributed\namong five large circular holes around\nthe periphery of a disk.

The oscillators can be\nfrequency-modulated , phase-modulated, or pulse-modulated. Two such circuits are described here.\nThe SAW resonators are especially\napplicable to low-power subminiature\napplications, such as biotelemetry and\nwind-tunnel instrumentation, where they\ncan advantageously replace crystals.\nThe resonators are smaller than crystals\nand very thin - an advantage where\nsmall package size is important. They\nare fabricated with integrated-circuit\ntechniques, so their use in place of crystals gives promise of totally-integrated\ntelemetry systems in the future. SAW\noscillators can be directly modulated\nwithout the need for the multiplying\nstages often required with crystals,\nwhich simplifies the circuitry and further\nreduces size.\nThe transistor used as the amplifying\nelement in the oscillator has three connections, and the two-port SAW resonator has four. Therefore numerous circuit\nconfigurations are possible. Figure 1\nshows a single-pole two-port SAW\nresonator used as the frequencycontrolling element in a Colpitts-type\noscillator operating at 150 MHz. The\nSAW device uses an ST-cut quartz substrate to achieve a higher temperature\nstability than can be obtained with other\nsubstrates, such as lithium niobate or\nlithium tantalate. However, since the STcut quartz has a higher insertion loss\nthan the other substrates, the voltage is\nfed back directly from the collector\nrather than from a capacitor tap as is\nusual with this type of oscillator. The\nvariable capacitor is adjusted for\nresonance at the operating frequency.\nThis version of the oscillator can be used\nwith supplies ranging from 1 to 6 volts,\nand current drains as low as 0.4 mA can\nbe achieved by increasing the values of\nthe bias resistors.\n\nRADIO.\nFREQUENCY\nCHOKE\n~\n\n__\n\n~~\n\n_ _ _ _, -_ _ _ _, -_ _\n\n-J\n\nTT~~\n\n_________\n\n+V\n\n1,OOOpF\nTO ANTENNA\n\n+-----------------..

The method\ncharges " dead" cells using current increments rather than continuous, constant current.\nFormerly, NilCd cells removed from\nstorage were activated by a Cl20 charging current (Le., an amperage equal to\n\none-twentieth of the ampere-hour capacity of the battery) maintained for\n48 hours. This practice involved an overcharge of 100 percent, which evolved a\ngreat deal of heat. The end-of-charge\nvoltage was relatively low because of\nthe low charging rate and the elevated\ntemperature.\n\nThe new procedure starts with a low\ncharging rate .(CI20) for hours to remove some of the passive material that\nadds to the impedance of the electrochemical cell. Then the charging rate is\nmaintained at C/10 for another 6 hours.\nNext, the cell is charged at C/5 until\n1.435 volts per cell are reached.

A microcomputer calculates range and range\xc2\xb7 rate information by triangulation. The input data for this calculation are the\nposition coordinates of the two cameras and the pan and tilt aiming angles of the two cameras.\n\nA proposed microcomputer-controlled\nsystem computes the range and range\nrate of a moving object being tracked by\ntwo TV cameras. The pan and tilt\n(azimuth and elevation) angles of each\ncamera are controlled by correction signals derived from the camera video\nsignals. The range and range rate of the\nobject are computed by triangulation\nfrom pan\xc2\xb7 and tilt\xc2\xb7angle data and known\ncamera coordinates.\nThe system could be useful for target\nranging at distances up to about 1,000\nfeet (300 m) in such applications as vehi\xc2\xb7\ncle collison avoidance, traffic monitor\xc2\xb7\ning, and surveillance. It might also\nsubstitute for short\xc2\xb7 range radar in situations where the radar signal could not be\ntolerated.\nThe figure shows a block diagram of\none proposed configuration. The two TV\ncameras are aimed at the object being\ntracked. They are mounted on pan and\n\nNASA Tech Briefs. Winter 1982\n\ntilt units that are controlled by the\nremote-control unit.

Each camera digitally encodes\nits current angle settings into one TV\nframe line.\nThe two TV signals are fed to TV\nmonitors and to video target trackers by\nthe video switching unit and the remotecontrol unit. The balanced-to-unbalanced amplifiers convert the video Into\nthe standard unbalanced format required by the trackers.\nThe trackers do two things: They insert cursors into the video Signals to\nmark the camera aim points on the\nmonitor screens, and they develop\nanalog error-signal voltages that indicate the direction and magnitude of\naiming errors in both the horizontal and\n\nvertical directions. The error signals go\nto zero when the target edge being\ntracked coincides with the cursor location . The command formatter converts\nthe analog error signals into digital commands for the pan and tilt units to aim\nthe cameras directly at the object.\nThe line n decoder retrieves the panand tilt-angle data from the TV signals\nand feeds them to the microcomputer\nsystem in which the triangulation calculations are performed.

Immunity to speed perturbations caused by data dropouts Is obtained by switching to a different data-channel reference signal whenever a dropout Is detected by the frame synchronizer In the channel\ncurrently In use. The desired tape speed is selected by changing the frequency of the demand rate clock and changing the divisor N in the\nprogramable divider.\n\nAt data densities above 33 kbitlin .\n(13 kbitlcm), conventional servocontrol\ntechniques proved to be inadequate for\ncontrolling tape movement in a groundsupport recorder for a NASA satellite.\nTachometer feedback did not have the\nrequired resolution; conventional tape\nfeedback lacked stability (particularly at\nlow speeds) and was sensitive to tape\ndropouts. A new system has the necessary resolution and is less sensitive to\ndropouts than are other tape feedback\nsystems. It is also stable at low speeds.\nIn the new system the servo feedback\nsignal is derived from the data track\nsignals, so that no separate servo track\nis required. The system can be adapted\nto any recorder that uses deskew buffers. It requires no overhead information\nbeyond the synchronizing words already\nrequired for data deskewing.\nAt high bit densities a skew occurs\nbetween the data read from different\n138\n\ntracks; that is corresponding data bits\non different tracks arrive at slightly different times. To correct skew error, sync\nwords are recorded periodically in each\ntrack. During reproduction , the data\nread from different tracks are resynchronized using the sync words for\nframing reference. Frame synchronization is achieved by storing the data bits\nfrom each track in a separate deskew\nbuffer memory as they are read from the\ntape and then clocking out corresponding bits from all the deskew buffers\nsimultaneously.\nThe figure shows the signal paths of\nthe servo loop. A phase-locked-loop circuit compares the phase of a signal\nderived from the demand rate clock to\nthat of a signal derived from one of the\ndata tracks being written . The phase error between these two signals is directly\nproportional to the level of data in the\ndeskew buffer. Depending on the sign\n\nand magnitude of the detected phase error, the reference frequency of the tapetransport servo is raised or lowered\nslightly to reduce the phase error toward\nzero, thus maintaining a constant net\nlevel of data in the buffer.\nThe tape transport is also phaselocked using a motor/tachometer feedback signal. This allows the transport to\nhave constant gain (20 dB) out to about\n700 Hz. Since the bit sync circuit also\nhas constant gain (0 dB) to about 500\nHz, it is possible to control the entire\nsystem response with the servo phaselocked loop. By keeping the servo bandwidth very small (2 Hz at the lowest tape\nspeed), total system stability is ensured.\nIn effect, the servo phase-locked loop\nmonitors the level of data in one of the\ndeskew buffers and adjusts the speed of\nthe transport accordingly. By regulating\nthe speed of the transport, it controls the\nrate at which data are written into the\nNASA Tech BrIefs, WInter 1982\n\nbuffer, thereby preventing buffer overflow and underflow. It also maintains the\noptimum level of fullness, which provides maximum deskew capability.\nDropouts in the data channel providing the feedback signal cause a\nphase error in that signal, which , if uncorrected, would cause bit errors. A\ndropout tends to reveal itself, however,\nby causing the following sync word to\nturn up at an incorrect separation. The\n\nframe synchronizer detects \'this and\nsignals the handover control to switch to\na second data channel that is still properly phased, before erroneous information gets to the phase detector. Thus,\nphase lock is maintained in spite of data\ndropouts. In applications where frequent\ndata dropouts can be tolerated, this\nmakes it possible to use cheaper tape.\n\nThis work was done by Mark D. Matlin\nand Arthur M.

Unlike\nprevious sensors that compare the\namplitudes of signals picked up from the\nguide wire, the new system compares\nthe signal phases.\nIn the new system, an array of coils,\nmounted in a line along the front bumper\nof the vehicle (see figure) monitors the\nelectromagnetic signal radiating from\nthe wire. The guide wire on the ground\nbeneath the vehicle carries a 6- to 7-kHz\nalternating current.\nThe phase-sensing system is less sensitive to electromagnetic noise than was\nthe amplitude-sensing system. In addition , the system " remembers " the last\nposition of the wire and validates a new\nposition only if it falls immediately on\neither side of the previous position. The\nremembered position is also used during\nbrief periods of lost signal.\n-The signals picked up by the two coils\nmounted horizontally serve as a phase\nreference. The vertically mounted coils\nare sensitive only to the vertical component of the guide-wire magnetic field\nwhich changes sign from one side of the\nwire to the other. As the vehicle moves\nto one side with respect to the wire, one\ncoil after another undergoes a phase\nreversal, indicating the change in the\nposition of the vehicle.\nThe amplitude of the signal varies\nsomewhat from coil to coil due to the differing distances from the wire and to the\nvariation in angle between the coils and\nthe magnetic field. Before the phase\ncomparisons are done, the Signals are\namplified and clipped to constant\namplitude.

The phase-transition point indicates the position of the guide-wire.\n\nis stored in a flip-flop. Only a coil passing\ndirectly over the wire should undergo a\nphase reversal; any other reversal is\nconsidered spurious - indicating noise\ninterference or other undesirable effects. Spurious reversals of each flipflop are prevented by controlling the set\nand reset inputs with signals from the\ntwo adjacent flip-flops. If those two flipflops have identical output polarity,\nchange is inhibited. (The inhibition logic\ncould be extended to as many adjacent\nflip-flops as desired.)\n\nThe flip-flop outputs can encode\nnumerical values of wire position for\ntelemetry, data processing, and control.\nThe deviation in position wjth respect to\nthe wire can be expressed as a number\nproportional to the tracking error. This\nerror signal can be used to control the\nvehicle-steering motors.\n\nThis work was done by George R.\nHansen of Caltech for NASA\'s Jet Pro\xc2\xb7\npulsion Laboratory.

It should be of interest to those designing and using communications systems susceptible to\nblackout.\nWhen the orbiter reenters the Earth\'s\natmosphere during a typical deorbit-tolanding trajectory, it initially travels at\nhypersonic speeds. Shock-heated air\nenvelops the entire orbiter in a layer of\ndissociated and ionized air molecules\ntermed the "plasma sheath ." This\nplasma sheath is electrically conducting, and electromagnetic interaction\nwith the free electrons in the plasma can\nsignificantly impair radio-frequency\ntransmissions. In addition to the signal\nattenuation due to propagation in the\nplasma, the reflections and refractions\nat the plasma interface can also represent a significant power loss to the\noverall communications link with the\norbiter.\nThe Orbiter Entry Communications\nBlackout Study program determines the\n\nthree-dimensional shock shape of the\norbiter, used to define the plasma properties and plasma sheath aerodynamically, from the real shape of the vehicle\nflow field and the associated boundarylayer displacement. The program computes the electromagnetic-radiation\npower loss through the plasma sheath\nbased on the vehicle antenna characteristics and the actual line-of-sight vector\ndetermined by the receiver station\nrelative to the flightpath and the attitude\nof the vehicle in space. The program can\nbe readily adapted to predict the entry\ncommunications blackout for any non\xc2\xb7\nablative entry vehicle.\nThis program is written in FORTRAN\nIV for batch execution and has been implemented on a CDC 6000-series com\xc2\xb7\nputer with a central memory requirement of approximately 163K (octal) of\n60-bit words.

The new\ndesign is used in pupil-concentric systems, such as the Schmidt-type mirror\nobjective shown in the figure.\nMany optical applications require one\nobjective to form images at several focal\nplanes. Examples include color-TV\ncameras with three vidicon tubes and\ncameras used to separate a color image\ninto separate colors for color printing\npresses.\nIn pupil-concentric systems, all the\noptical elements are concentric about\nthe aperture stop; the system has no\npreferred axis, and therefore there are\nno off-axis aberrations. Such systems\nexhibit only spherical and chromatic\naberrations.\nThe introduction of a block beam splitter destroys the symmetry of pupilconcentric systems and introduces severe Seidel and chromatic aberrations.\nCompensating elements can be added\nbut only at the expense of weight and\ncompactness.\nThe proposed beam splitter -like the\nblock beam splitter - has an opticallyflat, partially-reflecting interior surface.\nUnlike the conventional design, however, the beam entrance and exit surfaces are spherical and concentric\nabout the aperture stop. Thus the beam\nsplitter surfaces generate only spherical\nand chromatic aberrations. While these\naberrations may be larger than without\nthe beam splitter, no new types of aberration are introduced.\nThe interior reflecting surface can be\nmetallic for wavelength-independent\nbeam splitting or dichroic (showing different color in different directions) to\nsplit the beam into different wavelength\nbands. Since the lens power and\nspherical aberration of the proposed\nbeam splitter are quite low, systems with\na very large wavelength range are possible without resorting to additional optical\n(contlnueo on next page)\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1982\n\nTOP VIEW\n\n~\n\n---------------APERTURE\n\nSTOP\n\nIMAGE\nSURFACE\n\n-- ----- ----\n\nCOMPENSATOR\nPLATE\nSIDE VIEW\n\nOBJECTIVE\nMIRROR\n\n--- - --- - ---\n\nI__\n\nAPERTURE\nSTOP\n\nCROSS SECTION OF\nBEAM SPUTTER\n\nIMAGE\nSURFACES\n\nThe Spherical-Surface Beam Splitt er can be used in a Schmidt\xc2\xb7type mirror objective to\nsplit the converging image-forming beam so that two images are formed .

The reflections of a\nlaser beam from patterns on the satellite\nyield information on the radial misalinement, angle between axes, and range\n(Figure 1).\nAn optical transmitter/receiver on the\nspacecraft projects the laser beam on\nthe satellite. A mechanism moves the\nbeam direction in a cone, so that the\nlight beam scans the target in a circular\nor an elliptical pattern.\nA target on the satellite consists of\ntwo concentric sections (Figure 2):\n-Section A is an annulus in which reflectivity decreases with distance from the\ncenter of the target. It consists of concentric rings, alternately of high and\nlow reflectivity. The ratio of the widths\nof two adjacent zones is tapered as a\nfunction of radius to give a reflectivity\nthat decreases exponentially with\nradius. The width of a ring is only a\nsmall fraction of the diameter of the\nmoving light spot.\n-Section B is a central circular area, the\nreflectivity of which varies in a known\nmanner with the angle of the incident\nlaser beam but not with radial position.\nTo determine the range, or distance\nbetween the sensor and the target, the\noptical system\' adjusts the scanningcone angle so that the ratio of maximum\nto minimum power from the target rings\nequ?ls a preset value. As a consequence of the exponential taper, the\nrange is inversely proportional to this\nscanning-cone angle. (When there is\nangular misalinement, the range head\xc2\xb7\ning may be slightly in error on account of\nthe consequent elliptical shape of the\nscan.)\nThe direction of the radial misalinement is derived from the beam-scan\n\n146\n\nR\nr: RADIAL MISALINEMENT\n8: ANGULAR MISALINEMENT\nR: RANGE\n\nFigure 1. The Docking Sensor System determines radial misalinement, angular misalinement, and range.\n\nFigure 2. The Target Pattern consists of rings of alternating high and low reflectivity and a\ncentral section where reflectivity varies with the angle of incidence but not with position.\n\nangles at the moments of maximum and\nminimum reflected power. The required\ncorrection is a rotation of the spacecraft\nin the plane defined by the scanningbeam positions at maximum and minimum reflection, toward the position of\nmaximum reflection from section A. A\nsequence of such corrections will cause\nthe center of the cone to approach the\ncenter of the target.\n\nAs the radial misalinement is reduced\nto a small value, the beam illuminates\nmore and more of the central circular\narea of the target, section B. The low reflectivity of section B produces increasingly long dips at the output of the light\nsensor, signaling the approaching end of\nthe radial correction phase. That phase\nis ended when the entire conical scan\nfalls into section B.\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1982\n\nThe amount of angular misalinement\nis indicated by the ratio of maximum to\nminimum power reflected from section\nB. As the angular misalinement decreases, the fluctuations in reflected\npower decrease until reflected power\n\nremains at a constant level. The required correction for angular misalinement is rotation of the spacecraft about\nan axis in the plane of the target perpendicular to the plane defined by the scanning beam at the points of maximum and\nminimum reflection from section B.\n\nThis work was done by Fredrick\nWeindling of United Aircraft Corp. for\nMarshall Space Flight Center.

The algorithm was originally devel\xc2\xb7\noped for digitally pointed antennas in the\ndeep-space network; however, it could\npossibly be used in locating radio\nsources on Earth.\nTRISCAN (the acronym stands for triangular scan) estimates the coordinate\nerrors in hour angle and declination between the predicted and the true locations of a radio source. For stars,\nTRISCAN employs a set of measurements made by a noise-adding radiometer . This device yields a temperature\nreading proportional to the system background noise power plus any noise\npower emanating from the star; the latter is attenuated by an amount that\ndepends on the antenna boresight offset. When the background temperature\nis subtracted from the total reading\nwhile the boresight is in the vicinity of a\nstar, the result is the effective star temperature at the given offset.\nThe algorithm uses the measurement\nof three effective star temperatures\nfrom the same star (see figure). The first\nmeasurement is made at the predicted\nor best-known location of the star. The\nsecond and third measurements are\nmade at the base pOints of a known triangle. The ratios TOfT1 and TOfT2 are\nused to calculate offset parameters, using the general relationship between relative temperature reading and boresight offset.

The maximum efficiency is 44 percent for silicon. The highest solar-energy conversion efficiencies correspond\nto threshold energy levels between 0.75 and 1.5 eV for all operating temperatures.\n\nThe curves shown give the maximum\npossible conversion efficiency for any\ndevice having a threshold energy. The\nmaximum efficiency of 44 percent requires an operating temperature of 0 K\n\nand a threshold energy of 1.1 eV. This\nthreshold energy coincides with the\nenergy band gap for silicon. For comparison, the limiting efficiency for a gallium arsenide device is 41 percent and\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1982\n\nfor a cadmium sulfide device is 22 percent at this same temperature.\nPs the operating temperature of a\nthreshold device increases, its limiting\nsolar conversion efficiency decreases.\nThe curves indicate that the highest\nsolar conversion efficiencies will be for\ndevices with threshold energies between 0.75 and 1.5 eV for all temperatures. Limiting efficiencies decrease\nrapidly for threshold energies greater\nthan 1.5 eVor less than 0.75 eVfor practical operating temperatures.\nAlthough the efficiency curves refer\nspecifically to the conversion of solar\nradiation, they can also be used to find\n\nthe limits to the conversion efficiency for\nthreshold devices and radiation from a\nblackbody at any temperature with a\nsimple modification. In addition, they\ncan be used to find the maximum conversion efficiency for devices that have\nboth a threshold and a cutoff energy\n(Le., an absorption band.)\nThe analysis gives the limits to the\nconversion efficiency of any threshold\ndevice, given only its temperature and\nthreshold energy and the temperature of\nthe blackbody radiator.

The new\nreactor operates in a relatively-narrow\ntemperature range, 1,200 0 to 1,450 0 C,\nand uses a large surface area to minimize heat expenditure and processing\ntime in producing silicon by the\nhydrogen reduction of trichlorosilane.\nConventional methods of silicon production, by the hydrogen reduction of\ntrichlorosilane, produce solid silicon\nunits and require shutdown , setup, and\nstartup between each production run,\nwhich requires a much greater heat expenditure.\nThe new quartz reactor produces\nsilicon and depoSits it at 1,200 0 C, melts\nand feeds the silicon to a melt crucible\nor crystal puller, and then seals the feed\ntube at 1,200 0 C to begin another cycle\nof silicon production. The large internal\nsurface area is created by inserting vertical baffles (see figure). The baffles\ncreate gas turbulence, which aids in\nmixing the reactants, and provide heattransfer area that speeds the reaction.\nHeat loss from the reactor is minimized\nby covering the heating elements that\nsurround the reactor with adequate\ninsulation.\nThe two cycles of the reactor consist\nof silicon production and removal. Initially, the reactor is brought up to the reaction temperature under an inert-gas\nflow. A small amount of silicon is then\nmelted in the U-tube below the reactor\nvessel to form a positive seal, and the\nU-tube temperature is dropped to about\n1,200 0 C to seal itself; the tube has its\nown separate heating element and insulation and a vent that prevents complete drainage of its lower section. With\nthe tube sealed, the reactant-gas flow\nbegins and continues until the desired\namount of silicon is deposited.\nAt that point the reactant gases are\nflushed out of the reactor with argon to\nbegin the silicon-removal cycle. Keeping\nthe U-tube at 1,200 0 C, the reactor is\nraised to about 1,450 0 C to melt the\ndeposited silicon, and the gas pressure\nbetween the reactor and delivery tube is\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1982\n\nGAS INLET\n\nGAS EXIT\n\nV27777J\nWATER\xc2\xb7\n\nCOOLED\nCHAMBER\nINSULATION\n-r.rTit-+-~\n\n__ REACTION\nCHAMBER\n\nBAFFLE~--!I.--+H+!--1\n\nGRAPHITE\n\n~I.l!.!--+--f"I- REACTOR\n\n....\n\nSUPPORT\n\nDELIVERY\nTUBE\n\nU\xc2\xb7TUBE\nVALVE\n\n~~rf~~~II~~Ii~~\n\nTO MELT CRUCIBLE\nOR CRYSTAL PULLER\n\nThe Reactor Walls and Baffles combine to create a large surface area onto which silicon\ncan deposit.

Next, the temperature of the\nU-tube and delivery tube is raised to\nabout 1,415 0 C, causing the silicon to\ndrain, under gravity, from the reactor.\nWhen drained, the reactor is rettlrned to\nreaction temperature, and the U-tube\nand delivery tube are returned to\n1,200 0 C. Finally, the reactant gases\nare readmitted to the reactor to start\nanother silicon-production cycle.\nTo prevent the reaction vessel from\nsagging when the silicon melts from it, a\n\npressure equalizer maintains a slight\npositive pressure inside the vessel.

It gives test results similar to\nthose obtained with synthetic seawater,\nbut is less expensive to prepare.\nIn a stress-corrosion-cracking (sec)\ntest, the alloy sample is strained in a\ncoated aluminum stressing jig, then\nalternately immersed in the corrosive\nsolution until failure or until the end of\nthe test period (typically, 3 months). The\n\n156\n\ntest solution should be just corrosive\nenough to enable discrimination among\nmetals of low, intermediate, and high\nsec resistance.\nIf the solution causes extensive pitting , it is too corrosive for sensitive\ntesting : The tensile stresses at the\napexes of the pits are difficult or impossible to calculate, and the net section\nstress is greater than the original appiied\nstress. As a result, the sec effects are\nmasked by pitting effects.\n\nIn the search for a mild corrosive, 14\ndifferent salt solutions were screened in\nalternate-immersion tests on 3 aluminum alloys.

A relatively\xc2\xb7small\ntemperature difference between such a\ntank and the surrounding air will ensure\nthat the life of the tank is extended by\nmany years.\nAluminum is corrosion-resistant in air\ncontaining water vapor alone because\nof the protective oxide film that forms on\nits surface. However, the aluminum can\ncorrode near seawater. The salt in the\nair breaks down the protective film and\ncauses pitting.\nWater vapor penetrates the foam insulation from its warm exterior surface\nto the cool surface of the aluminum\ntanks. The vapor from seawater, condensing on the cool tank, thus initiates\ncorrosion. However, heating the interior\nof the tank to a temperature above that\nof the ambient air reverses the vaporpermeation trend and prevents mOisture\nfrom condensing on the aluminum.\n(continued on next page)\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1982\n\nThe PIHed Aluminum Specimen at the left was not heated above the ambient temperature\nin the salt-spray chamber. The completely uncorroded specimen at right was heated to\n112 0 F (44 0 C) by a small light bulb in a box behind the specimen.\n157\n\nCorrosion tests were conducted on\nfoamed aluminum panels in a 5-percentsalt fog. One panel was heated from the\nback to a temperature 18 0 F (10 0 C)\nabove the 94 0 F (34 0 C) air temperature\nin the test chamber. After 11 days exposure, the panels were removed from\nthe test chamber, and the foam was\nstripped from them. The heated panel\nshowed no corrosion, but the unheated\npanel was pitted (see figure). Interestingly, the foam was much more easily removed from the unheated panel. Apparently moisture not only corrodes the aluminum but also decreases the adhesion\nof the foam .\n\nThe 18 0 F temperature difference on\nthe heated panel was selected arbitrarily. The corrosion of aluminum tanks occurs most rapidly when the outside\ntemperature and humidity are both high\n[on a warm day, the outside of the foam\ncan reach 114 0 F (46 0 C) while the\naluminum is 8 OF (4 0 C) less]. On cool\ndays or on days when the humidity is\nlow, water-vapor permeation is negligi\xc2\xb7\nble. Thus, the heating of tank interiors\nwould not be required at all times; it\nwould be needed more in the warm and\nhumid summer months than in the\ncooler and dryer months.\n\nFurther study is needed to determine\nprecisely the minimum temperature difference that will prevent corrosion\nunder various atmospheric conditions.\nFurther study will also determine the\ntypes of heaters, heating capacity, and\nheat circulation necessary to maintain\ntank inter iors at the requisite\ntemperature.\n\nThis work was done by Lyle E.\nJohnson of Martin Marietta Corp. for\nMarshall Space Flight Center.

The\nquartz ampoule permits reliable measurement of the melt properties of a material such as lead/tin/telluride (PbSnTe).\nConfinement of the sample in a vacuum\nprevents contamination of the measurement system by hot corrosive vapors\nand any interference by preferential\nevaporation of the melt.\nThe sample is contained in a quartz\ntube between two quartz plugs polished\non both ends.

The new thermoplastic,\nsolvent-resistant polymer can be used\nas a molding resin, as an adhesive, and\nas a matrix resin for fiber-reinforced\ncomposites. The process for thermoplastically forming this resin can be used\nto produce moldings, adhesive bonds,\nand fiber-reinforced composites.\nAromatic polysulfones, a class of\nthermoplastic polymers, are soluble In\nsuch solvents as chloroform, methylene\nchloride, cyclohexanone, cresol , and hydraulic fluids. Since components fabrIcated from these polysulfones are susceptible to damage by these solvents,\nthis polymer system cannot be used in\nmany applications where the solvents\nare present. Aromatic polyimides, on the\nother hand, are a class of polymers that\nare exceptionally resistant to solvents\nbut that are generally considered not\nreadily processable by thermoplastic\ntechniques. Both polymer systems have\ngood thermal stabilities.\nThe desired poly(imidesulfone) Is obtained through the incorporation of an\naromatic sulfone moiety In the backbone of an aromatic linear polylmlde to\nyield an aromatic poly(imldesulfone)\nprepared In bis(2-methoxyethyl) ether\nsolvent.

Conversely, the\nincorporation of an Imide segment Into\nthe base polysulfone results in a solventresistant polymer that was previously\nsoluble In common solvents. The structure of the polymer is shown in the\nfigure. In the structure shown, it is the\n3,3\'-disubstltuted diphenylsulfone segment of the polymer that causes it to be\nthermoplastic.\nThin films of the poly(imidesulfone)\nplaced in various solvents were not affected. After removal from the solvents,\nthe films had the same softening temperatures as before exposure. Even\nslight solvation of the polymer would\ncause a considerable lowering of the\nsoftening temperature.\nAdhesive lap-shear samples prepared\nwith the poly(lmidesulfone) had exceptionally high strengths when tested at\nambient temperature, at 177\xc2\xb0 C, and at\n232\xc2\xb0 C, both before and after aging for\n1,000 hours at 232 0 C in a flowing-air\noven.

Graphite-fiber-rein\xc2\xb7\nforced moldings (composites) were successfully prepared using unidirectional\nhigh-tensile-strength fibers in the resin.\nThis poly(imidesulfone) can be thermoplastically processed in the 250\xc2\xb0-to350\xc2\xb0 C range to yield high-quality tough\nmoldings, strong hlgh-temperatureresistant adhesive bonds, and wellformed structural composites.

A signal proportional to the current drawn by the\ncamera film-advance motor was also\ntelemetered as a time indicator for the\nfilm sequence.\nThe photographic record shows that\nmany of the bubbles in the glass were\nrapidly swept out by the high temperature gradient as it heated up to\nabout 913 0 C. Since there was also a\nstrong transverse gradient, bubbles\n\nmigrated not only longitudinally along\nthe sample-capsule channel but also\ntransversely to the strip heater. Once\nthey contact the strip, bubbles move\nslowly if at all. As the experiment progressed, bubbles that were in cooler\nregions were slowly drawn to the center\nof the channel.\nThis work was done by W. R.

Although\ndeveloped as an aid in the design of protective glass covers for solar-cell arrays\nand solar collectors, the method should\nalso be useful in estimating the reliability\nof large windows in buildings exposed to\nhigh winds and can be adapted to non\xc2\xb7\nlinear stress analysis of simply sup\xc2\xb7\nported plates of any elastic material.\nFor economy, glass plates should\nhave the minimum thickness consistent\nwith a reasonably low risk of failure. In\nthe past, the minimum allowable thickness has been determined from design\ncurves published by glass manufac-\n\nturers, but such curves have certain\nshortcomings: They are sometimes derived from tests on only a few samples\nand therefore do not have a strong\nstatistical base. Usually the curves do\nnot take load history into account, even\nthough the breaking strength of glass\ndepends strongly on load duration. Snow\nand deadweight ordinarily are not important in vertical windows; but because\nsolar-collector panels are tilted, such\nloads last longer than windloads and\nmay cause failure at lower stress.\nThe new method allows the designer\nto select the glass thickness that will\nsustain given normal pressure loads at a\nspecified failure rate. There are two key\nelements of the method: First, design\ncurves were developed that permit the\n\nuser to estimate the stress in the glass\ncaused by the given applied loads.\nSecond: statistical analysis was used to\nproduce curves that give the breaking\nstrength of the glass as a function of\nfailure rate, glass temper, load duration,\nand panel area. A satisfactory design is\nattained when the estimated applied\nstress is slightly less than the estimated\nbreaking strength corresponding to the\naccceptable failure rate.\nThis work was done by Donald M.\n\nMoore of caltech for NASA\'s Jet Pro\xc2\xb7\npulsion Laboratory.

In a laboratory prototype, the\nreduction of silicon tetrachloride by\nsodium is the key reaction and the byproduct is NaCI, although other silicon\n\nhalides could probably be substituted for\nthe tetrachloride.\nIn the processor (see figure), vapors\nor fine liquid sprays of sodium and silicon tetrachloride react to form gaseous\nNaCI and liquid droplets of silicon. To\nprevent condensation of the salt vapor\n\nor solidification of the silicon, the reactor\ntemperature is held above 1,415 0 C,\n50 C above the melting point of silicon.\nThe reactor pressure is about 0.25 atm\n(2.5x104 N/m 2).\nThe products exit through an orifice at\nthe bottom of the reactor into a volume\n(continued on next page)\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1982\n\n161\n\nkept at less than half the reactor pressure. The pressure difference creates a\njet of gaseous NaCI that carries the\nsilicon droplets.\nA separator/collector surface, placed\nacross the jet in the low-pressure\nregion, intercepts the impinging jet. The\nsilicon hits the surface, which is held\nnear 1,412 0 C, and collects on it. The salt\nflows away to cooler surfaces in regions\nof even lower pressures. These cooler\nsurfaces rapidly condense the salt vapor,\neliminating the need for vacuum pumps.\nThe separator/collector surface is a\npedestal in the center of a crucible. The\nsilicon, .separated from the salt, flows\ndown the funnel-shaped walls of the\nseparator/collector into a much larger\ncollector, where it rapidly solidifies. The\ncollector is isolated from the reactor and\nseparator in the process vessel by a\nvacuum lock.

The large surface-to-volume\nratio of the sprayed sodium droplets\nwould make the reaction proceed faster\nthan If the liquid sodium was poured Into\nthe reactor.\nIn the proposal , the liquid sodium at\nabout 100 0 C is sprayed (see figure) into\nthe silicon tetrafluoride gas and reacts\nwith it only at the bottom of the reactor,\nwhere the temperature is 400 0 to\n900 0 C. The rest of the reactor temperature is low .enough to avoid excessively vaporizing the sodium, so that the\nreaction products form only on the reactor bottom. Also, to insure that the\n\nLIQUID\nSODIUM\n\nNOZZLE\n\nsodium spray does not clog the reactor,\nby hitting the walls, the angle of the\nspray cone is sufficiently narrow, and a\nbaffle is installed.\nWhen the reactor is full , the sodium\nand silicon tetrafluoride flows stop.

The lower\npart of the reactor is kept at a temperature higher than 300 0 C, and the\nupper part is kept at 11 0 0 C. Uquid\nsodium feeds from a nozzle at the top\nof the reactor without reacting with\nthe SiF4. When the sodium reaches\nthe higher temperature region at the\nbottom, the reaction takes place\nimmediately.\nSome of the advantages that this\ntechnique has over previous batch\ntechniques are:\n-A constant pressure can be used,\nsimplifying the SiF4 feeding system;\n-The temperature of the reaction can\nbe controlled easily by changing the\n\nfeeding rate of Na and the pressure of\nSiF4. resulting in more-homogeneous\nreaction products;\n-The efficiency of material consumption is almost 100 percent;\n-The Impurity pickup from the reactor\nwalls Is minimized; and\n- The reaction products only contact\nthe reactor walls at the base, making\nit easier to remove them from the\nreactor.\nReaction parameters for a twotemperature-zone reactor have yet to\nbe worked out.

In\naddition to falling through a gas, the\ndroplets of molten silicon fall through a\ncold liquid. Both the heat-transfer coefficient and the temperature difference\nbetween the hot silicon and the cold surrounding liquid are greater than they\nwould be for a gas. Therefore the heat of\nthe silicon droplets is transferred more\nquickly, and they become hard spheres\nwithin a shorter drop distance.\nThe conversion of silicon from powder or chunks to shot often simplifies\nprocessing. Shot is more easily handled\nin most processing equipment - in furnaces, for example.\nThe silicon droplets are ejected from\na nozzle into gaseous argon, through\nwhich they fall into liquid methanol (see\nfigure). In the methanol, the silicon cools\nand solidifies, falling as shot to the bottom of the tower, where it can be collected. The methanol liquid collected\nwith the shot is recycled.\nThe argon flowing above the liquid\nmethanol prevents methanol vapor from\nentering the upper part of the tower and\nthe nozzle.

The new\nmethod is based on the finding that rubber follows different stress/strain relationships in extension and retraction.\nPreviously, chain concentration was\nestimated by measuring the uniaxial\nstress/strain response in extension and\nusing the measurements in an equation\nhaving the chain concentration as one of\nits terms. One deficiency of this method\nis that rubber is basically viscoelastic,\nand therefore equilibrium or time-independent data are difficult to obtain. However, it has recently been found that\nwhile the stress/strain response in\nextension invariably follows equation (1)\nin the figure, the subsequent stress/\nstrain response in the same specimen in\nretraction almost invariably obeys equation (2) provided that elongation is not\nclose to the elongation at which stress\nwas reversed and that the maximum\nelongation is relatively large.\nTests were performed on ring specimens in a standard stress/strain testing\nmachine. When the maximum extension\nwas reached, the test machine was\nreversed so that retraction occurred at\nthe same constant rate as in extension.\nThe strain for both extension and retraction was calculated on the basis of the\noriginal dimensions of the specimen that is, no account was taken of permanent set, which was quite small.\nThe network chain concentration in\nthe samples was estimated by this\nmethod to be 122 x 10-6 mole/cm 3,\nwhich agrees well with the value of\n110 x 10-6 mole/cm 3 found by an independent technique. However, if one\nwere to use the data from extension\nalone, the value would be much lower:\n73x10-6 mole/cm 3 .\nIt is suggested that a gum vulcanizate\nis composed of two interdependent networks. One network is composed of\nthose chains attached at each end to\nchemically cross-linked units and known\nas permanent network chains. The other\nnetwork consists of entangled but not\ncross-linked chains; it is referred to as\nthe transient network.\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1982\n\no\nl\nT\nR\n\n= STRESS\n\n= EXTENSION RATIO\n= TEMPERATURE\n\n= GAS CONSTANT\nve = CONCENTRATION OF NETWORK CHAINS\nC1\nve RT12\n~ = CONSTANT\n\n=\n\n"\ng\n~\n\nlii\n\nEXTENSION:\nMOONEY\xc2\xb7RIVLlN RELATION\n(EOUATION 1)\n\nRETRACTION:\nKINETIC THEORY\n(EOUA TlON 2)\n0=\n\nveRT(l-\n\n*)\n\nSTRAIN, l\n\nWhen a Rubber Specimen Is stretched to a given extension ratio A and then released, its\nstress-vs.-straln curve follows two paths; one for extension and another for retraction.\n\nWhen the combined networks are\nsubjected to a load, the permanent\nchains respond almost immediately, but\nthe chains in the transient network move\nmore slowly from their initial position to a\nfinal position, which is reached after the\nentanglements have gone through their\nmaximum travel. The transient-network\nchains then function as if they formed a\npermanent network and continue to do\nso until the load is reduced to near zero;\nthen relatively slow rearrangements occur, and the entanglements move back\nto a stress-free position.\nFor rubber containing a filler material,\n.there is the additional effect of dewetting\nor separation of the rubber from the surface of the filler particles under load. The\nmodulus of filled rubber is given by two\ncontributions: (1) that from the network\nchain concentration of the rubber itself\n\nand (2) that from the presence of filler.\nThis latter contribution is proportional to\nthe fraction of surface area of filler in\ncontact with the rubber. The higher the\nelongation, the lower will be the modulus\nbecause some fraction of the surface\narea of the filler will have separated from\nthe rubber. As the load is reduced in the\nretraction portion of the load cycle,\nrewetting does not occur instantly, and\ntherefore the response is equivalent to\nthat of a sample with a lower filler level.\nWhen the load is reduced to zero, the\nrubber rewets the particles, and eventually the properties of the original\nunstressed sample are restored .\nThis work was done by Robert F.\nFOOors of Caltech for NASA\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

The injector would use a protective annular\nstream of high-velocity gas to cool the\ncone and to reduce or eliminate abrasion by circulating particles. This\ndiluent/fluidization gas would enter at\nseveral places around the base of the injector cone or through a continuous annulus. It would then flow toward the apex\nof the cone, carrying particles into the\nhighly-agitated reaction zone.\nA very highly agitated region is required to coat particles with such\nmaterials as silicon or carbon in a\nfluidized-bed system. Simple gasinjection cones are often abraded by\nparticles that strike the base of the cone.\nSimple cones also cause the bed to\nsurge or slug, resulting in some stagnation of the bed.\nIn the improved injector, the reaction\ngas that decomposes to provide the silicon or carbon to coat the particles\nwould enter through a tube along the\naxis of the injector cone. For carbon,\nthermally decomposable gases, such as\nmethane (CH4) or ethane (~H6), could\nbe used. For silicon , silane (SiH4) or\ntrichlorosilane (SiHCl3) could be used.\nThe reaction gas decomposes as it\ncomes in contact with the hot particles.\nIf necessary to prevent premature decomposition , the reaction gas could be\ncooled right up to the moment it enters\nthe fluidized bed.\nThe seed particles would enter\nthrough a piston valve at one side of the\nbed and flow quickly down the side, up\nthe cone, and into the reaction zone.\nCoated particles would be drawn off\nthrough a similar valve on the other side.\nDepending on purity requirements, injector components could be constructed from such materials as quartz,\ncarbon , or metal.\n\n166\n\nHEATER\n\nHIGH\xc2\xb7VELOCITY\n"iIL."\'<:::I!o.--ANNULUS\n\nFLUIDIZATION\nGAS\n\nCOOLANT/\n(IF NECESSARy)\n\nREACTION\nGAS\n\nThe Gas-Injection Cone in a fluidized-bed reactor for coating particles with silicon or carbon could be cooled and protected from abrasion by a stream of gas flowing over the surface of the cone.

Metal cations (positively\ncharged atoms) are present as contaminants or impurities in many industrial liquids. Liquids with these impurities are either enviromental pollutants or possible sources of recover\xc2\xb7\nable materials. In either case it is desirable to remove these metal Ions efficiently. Current systems employ cationexchange resins as powders, beads, or\ngranules for use in metal-removal filtration systems. In terms of energy\nrequirements and capital equipment\ncosts, however, these systems are not\noptimized since they are expensive and\nnot necessarily cost-effective. These\nsystems require pumping a liquid\nthrough a filtration system that is subject\nto both clogging and resin fouling.\nA method has been developed at\nLewis Research Center that is a major\nimprovement in metal-ion removal. It\neliminates the need for costly pumping\nand filtration equipment in specific appli\xc2\xb7\ncations. This technique enables the\ncation-exchange resin to be fabricated\ninto a more efficient form, that of a thin\n\nmembrane film of various sizes. Membranes of this type may be simply suspended in metal-ionlliquid solutions to\nremove the impurities. This removal\nsystem does not require pumping, filtration eqUipment, or constant movement\nof the solution. The unique quality of\nthese membrane films is that they are\nnonfouling and have outstanding highabsorption capacity.\nThe use of these membrane films affords a convenient and economical\nalternative for removing and recovering\nmetal cations present in low concentrations from large quantities of liquid solutions. Possible applications of these\nmembrane films include use in analytical chemistry for the determination of\nsmall amounts of toxic metallic impurities in lakes, streams, and municipal\neffluents. It is also possible that this type\nof ion-exchange membrane may be suitable for use as an absorber of certain\npollutant gases and odors present in\nconfined areas.\nThese membrane films comprise a\ncross-linked copolymer of polyacrylic\nacid (the active ion exchanger) and polyvinyl alcohol (the antifouling agent). An\n\naqueous solution of these constituents\nis cast (poured) onto a smooth surface\nand dried. The dried film is removed and\nformed into any desired shape. It is then\nexposed to ionizing radiation that\ncauses copolymerization and crosslinking.

With this\nmethod many clones can be bred from\na single parent, and each clone can\nthen be rooted and transplanted to soil\nwhere it will grow and mature. The\nmethod preserves a desired genetic\nidentity (genotype), so that the\nclones should produce as prolifically as\ntheir parents if planted in the same\nenvironment.\nThe guayule plant, Parthenium argentatum, forms many lateral buds, the\nmajority of which can be removed without affecting the growth of the parent\nplant. The small shoot tips, the most regenerative parts of the plant, are removed by microscalpels and placed on\nslants of sterilized tissue-culture\nmedium. The culture medium contains\nwater, agar, minerals, sucrose, thiamin\nhydrochloride, and the cytokinin benzylaminopurine (BAP).\nBy varying the concentration of the\ncytokinin, a single excised tip can produce either 1 or several (up to 50) new\nplants. In a medium with a 0.1-mg/l concentration of BAP, the tips respond\nquickly and produce new leaves, which\ndoes not occur with shoot tips grown in\na culture medium that lacks BAP.\nHigher concentrations of the cytokinin\naccelerate these developments.\nThe figure shows plant lets grown in\ncultures with different concentrations\nof BAP.

In effect, the\nstructure consists of many fiberglass\n"springs" that are forcibly coiled during\ninitial stowage in a canister. A considerable amount of energy stored in the\nstructure is released during deployment.\nThe boom has two sections: an "outboard" mast, containing electronic instrumentation or other hardware that is\ncarried by the boom, and "inboard"\nmast, which holds the canister in which\nthe collapsed boom is stored before it is\ndeployed. The inboard mast unfolds first\nduring the deployment sequence, followed by the outboard mast.\nThe deployment rate is controlled by a\nviscous damper located at the base of\nthe inboard mast (see figure). As the inboard mast deploys, its elastic energy\nproduces a force of 20 pounds (89 newtons) on a lanyard along the center of the\nmast. The lanyard transmits the force to\na rotary damper at its end, which limits\nthe rate at which the lanyard pays out.\nSimultaneously, the 20-pound lanyard\nforce is transmitted around an outboard\npulley and back to the inboard structure,\nthereby producing a force of 40 pounds\n(178 newtons) across the stowed outboard mast. The force holds the outboard mast closed until the inboard\nmast completes deployment. Then the\noutboard mast is freed to begin deployment by Its own stored energy, producing a 10-pound (45-newton) load on the\nlanyard.\nSprings initiate deployment at the inboard end of the longitudinal members\n(Iongerons) of each mast. The springs\nproduce a uniform torque through the\nfirst 45\xc2\xb0 of longeron uncoiling and\nguarantee that the erection sequence\nwill begin as shown in the figure.\nThe batten members are 14 percent\nsmaller in diameter in the first and second batten frames on the inboard end of\neach mast.

Air is injected along the floor and\ninteracts with the backflow from the\nwind\xc2\xb7 tunnel model. This results in a\nsmoother, more correct airflow and so\nto more-reliable wind-tunnel data.\nModels of high-lift aircraft are difficult\nto test in small wind tunnels because\nthey create jets of air that disturb airflow\nin unpredictable ways. A jet of air emerging from an aircraft model strikes the\ntunnel floor and spreads out forward\n(against the main airflow) and aft (see\nfigure, left). The forward-moving part of\nthe jet forms a vortex that disrupts the\nmain flow, causing the phenomenon\nknown as tunnel flow breakdown.\nHowever, if air is blown through a nozzle on the tunnel floor into the forwardspreading jet, the vortex is prevented\nfrom forming (see figure, right). Instead,\nthe blowing jet creates a mixing region\nthat hardly interferes with the flow at the\nmodel. The model experiences better\nlift, and test data correlate well with\ndata from large tunnels after standard\ncorrections are applied.\n\n-- "\n\n- ----- -\n\n......\n\n-----..\n,.----.....\n\n/ ,_J\n/\n\n/\'\n\n~\n\n.........\n\n........\n\n1\\\n\n.,..,\'\n\n-- "- \\ "\\" "/~/\n/ / - - ............\n/\n................\n\n"-\n\n......\n\n.,.., ..,\n\nJ)\n\n\\\n\n\\\n\n..,\n\n.;-\n\n...\n\n\\\n\n1\\ \\\n\n\\\\,\n\n\\ I{ \\ \'\\\n\\ +\\ \\ \'"\n\n""\\\\ I \\\n\n\\\'\n\n/,/\n\n\\\\\n\nTUNNEL\nFLOOR\n\nA Vortex Is Suppreued by \xe2\x80\xa2 Blowing Jet from a floor nozzle.

Values of acceleration, velocity, and displacement calculated by the new\nmethod and the conventional method differed by as little as a few parts per million .\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1982\n\nThe method is more exact than conventional normal-mode methods in that\nit involves no initial approximations or\nassumptions. All adaptation of the Newmark-Chan-Beta numerical integration\ntechnique is directly applied to the\ncoupled system equations, and thus the\nexpensive solution of a system eigenvalue problem is avoided. In the Newmark-Chan-Beta technique, the step\nsize can be based on the cutoff frequency associated with the forcing function\nregardless of the highest system fre-\n\nquency - a valuable feature since the\nhighest system frequency is usually not\nknown in advance.\nSeveral improvements over conventional techniques and cost-saving\nfeatures were introduced in the new\nmethod. For an indeterminate interface,\nit is not necessary to express the interface displacements in terms of accelerations and forces. Several simplifications were made in the preliminary\ncalculations that lead to more efficient\nand convenient calculation of loads.\n\nThe method is readily adaptable to\nshort cuts. For example, if a solution of a\nresponse and load problem is already\navailable and design changes are made\nin the payload, it is possible to develop a\ncriterion to determine whether the loads\nwill change significantly.\nThis work was done by Remi C.\nEngels of Martin Marietta Aerospace for\nMarshall Space Flight Center.

A remote light\nsource feeds light into an optical fiber or\ncable. The measurement end of the fiber\nis attached to a Fabry-Perot sensor,\nwhich consists of a small spacing that\nvaries with temperature.

A second output fiber transmits the light passing through this\n"Fabry-Perot" gap to a photodetection\nunit and finally to a decoder, before the\noutput is routed to the utilization means.\nThe gap widens as temperature increases.

In the proposal, a radioactive\nsource is deposited on the bottom of a\nlight, hollow sphere, such as a plastic\ntable-tennis ball, and suspended by a flexible wire over a radiation counter. The ball\ncan be punctured with symmetrically distributed holes or otherwise roughened for\naerodynamic stability.\nIf the source position is changed\nbecause of wind drag on the ball, the solid\nangle subtended by the counter decreases, and the counting rate is reduced. A graph of counting rate as a function of source position would be used to\ndetermine the source position and the\nwind drag on the ball.\nThe single-source/single-detector anemometer just described does not yield\nthe direction in which the source has\nmoved, however. Also, the counting rate\nwill not change if the source is moved\nalong the circumference of a circle, the\ncenter of which lies on the center of the\nprojection of the counter window on the\nsource plane. This ambiguity would be\nremoved by using three coplanar radiation counters located at equal distances\nalong the circumference of a circle with\nthe undisplaced source hanging over the\ncenter of the circle, as shown in the\nfigure.\nAn anemometer based on this concept\nwould be self-contained, portable, yet not\ntoo fragile.

Other ice-detection instruments\n178\n\nuse probes that project from the surface\non which ice will collect, thus creating\nthe problem of having to infer how much\nice is really on the surface of interest.\nThis is particularly troublesome when\nthe surface of interest is an aircraft sur-\n\nface since the water-droplet catch efficiencies will be different for the icedetector probe and the aircraft surface.\nThe MIAMI is embedded in the surface\nto be monitored and conforms to the surface contour. It automatically measures\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1982\n\nthe ice forming on the surface of interest. The MIAMI is the only instrument\nthat measures actual ice thickness and\naccretion rate in addition to giving an\nicing-onset warning.\nThe MIAMI detects the onset of icing\non a surface (e.g., aircraft wing), continuously monitors ice thickness, and\ndisplays ice thickness and accretion\nrate. A small, 1.4- by 0.4- by 0.2 inch\n(35.5- by 10.2- by 5.08-mm), microwave\nwaveguide is implanted just below the\nsurface to be monitored. One or more\nwaveguides may be mounted on different components of the aircraft. A microprocessor monitors the resonant frequency of the waveguide(s). As ice\nforms on the surface of the waveguide, it\ncauses the waveguide resonant frequency to decrease. The frequency shift\nis measured by the microprocessor and\nconverted to a dc voltage that is proportional to the ice thickness. The microprocessor also computes the change in\nice thickness with respect to time to get\nthe ice-accretion rate. The ice thickness\nand accretion rates are displayed on\ndigital panel meters.\nThe theoretical basis for the development ofthe MIAMI is that a resonant surface waveguide is tuned by the application of a substance (such as ice) with ap-\n\nproximately the same dielectric constant as the waveguide material. The\nresonant frequency of the transducer is\nvery sensitive to the thickness of the ice\naccreting on top of it. Ice layers of approll:imately 0.005 to 0.100 inch (0.13 to\n2.5 mm) are capable of being measured.\nThe transducer and its associated microprocessor convert the ice thickness\nto a dc voltage that varies in time in a\nmanner proportional to the ice thickness. The time derivative of this voltage\nis proportionate to the icing severity (accretion rate) and is continuously being\ncomputed and displayed by the microprocessor either as a severity level\n("TRACE," "LIGHT," "MODERATE," or\n"HEAVY") or numerically in inches or\ncentimeters per minute.\nThe effect of ice on the transducer is\ndifferent from other substances, such as\noil, grease, dirt, insects, or other contaminants. The microprocessor is programed to recognize the difference between ice and other substances so that\nvalid icing signals are generated only\nwhen ice forms. Water droplets that may\nform in the boundary layer are neglected\nby the system. Should a contaminant or\nforeign body other than Ice adhere to the\nsurface of the MIAMI, a continuous tone\nwill be generated providing a fail-safe in-\n\ndication of its operating ability until the\nforeign object is removed.\nBecause no probe projects into the\nairspace, the transducer may be\nmounted anywhere on the aircraft without interfering with the aerodynamic\nproperties of the aircraft. Also, since no\nprobe exists, there is no opportunity to\ndamage it or break it off or have it ingested by the engine.\nIf desired, the MIAMI transducer may\nbe equipped with an electrothermal\ndeicer to remove existing ice. With the\nMIAMI, ice removal is not necessary until the ice thickness exceeds its dynamic\nrange [0.125 inch (3.2 mm)). Deicing\nmay be programed to occur repetitively\nin a manner analogous to magnetostrictive transducers or not to occur until the\ntransducer approaches the limit of its\ndynamic range, thereby saving aircraft\nenergy. The MIAMI will provide a complete history of ice thickness, Including\nthe loss of ice by intentional deicing or\nnatural causes.\nThis work was done by Bertram\nMagenheim of Ideal Research, Inc., for\nlewis Research Center.

The approach is applicable to terrestrial antennas or other\nlarge lightweight structures.\nTo point the antenna in a particular\ndirection, the Space Shuttle is maneuvered into the appropriate orientation by\nIts pitch, roll , and yaw thrustors. This in,\nvolves a problem in vibration and attitude control analogous to that of carrying a bowl of soup: One has to move\ncarefully to avoid spills.\n(continued on next page)\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1982\n\nERROR\n\nRATE\n\nCURVATtlRE\nBASED ON\n\nCONTROL PLUS __- -"7\nENVIRONMENTAL\nTOROO=E_ _ _f-+\n\nERROR\n\nr -_ _ DEA[)\'BAND\n\nLIMITS\n\nAttitude Error and Error Rate are minimized by a properly-deslgned control law. The\ncontrol thrustor returns the attitude to a point within the control dead band whenever the\nattitude error or error rate strays outside. Within the dead band, the attitude drifts under\nenvironmental torque. The leftward thrustor fires when the system phase point Is to the\nright of the error dead band. The opposite Is the case for the rightward thrustor.\n179\n\nSimilarly, the Space Shuttle or other\nplatform carrying a large antenna on the\nend of a flexible mast must be moved\ncarefully to avoid setting up oscillations\nin the mast. Therefore step-by-step\nplans (more specifically, the turn-on and\nturn-off times for the thrustor pulses)\nmust be devised for each maneuver,\nand the mast must be designed to con-\n\nform to the characteristics of the\nthrustors.\nThe analysis resulted In a combined\nattitude-and-vibration-controllaw for the\nattitude-control vernier thrustors. The\ncontrol law is a function of the calculated vibration modes of the structure,\nand of the response of the system to environmental torques (gravity gradient,\naerodynamic, and solar radiation). The\n\nsystem response to a single control\npulse is computed by numerically integrating the equations of motion.

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nA " dead " needle technique pinpoints\nthe exact locations of very small leaks in\nplumbing and vacuum systems. The\nnew technique confines helium exposure to a small region rather than\nflooding the entire leak area with helium\ngas.\nIn conventional leak detection, helium\ngas Is usually fed to the vicinity of the\nleak under low pressure, while a massspectrometer leak detector monitors the\ninterior of the system for the presence of\nhelium gas. While this method indicates\nwhether or not a leak is present and\nnotes the approximate location of the\nleak, it usually does not precisely pinpoint the leak. The helium gas floods too\nwide an area around the leak to enable\nthe operator to determine the leak position with certainty. With the new technique the helium source is not pressurized, and the gas is localized to just the\nimmediate vicinity of the leak.\nThe test tool uses a fine-control valve\nand a hypodermic needle (see figure).\nAfter the needle is filled with helium, the\npressure is allowed to fall to atmospheric level, so that no helium actually\nflows from the needle if the air is still. As\nthe needle is brought up to a leak, the\nleak-induced air\'flow draws helium from\nthe "dead" needle, through the leak,\nand into the helium detector. This occurs only when the needle is very close\n(less than about 1 mm), so the leak can\nbe located to within a small area.\nThis technique could be applied in industrial situations. Examples would be\nnuclear-powerplant plumbing, valveand-pump bodies, vacuum systems, or\npressure vessels.\n\n180\n\nTEST TOOL\n\n~HELIUMSUPPLYLl~E~"\'-\xc2\xb7\n\n... \'\n\n\'\n\nAPPLICATIO\'I\n\nTEST FIXTURE\n\nD\nHELIUM\nMASSSPECTROMETER\nLEAK DETECTOR\n\n0 0 0\n\n0\n\n000\n\nThe Test Tool for Detecting Minute Leaks in. bimetal joints, welds, or other locations\nemploys a fine-control valve and a hypodermic needle.

The acoustic\nground-impedance meter utilizes direct\npressure/volume-velocity measurement, but avoids the major difficulty in\nthe measurement of volume velocity\nfound with other such methods in that\nthe volume velocity is defined by the\nknown stroke of a cam-driven piston.\nThe acoustic ground-impedance\nmeter offers several advantages. It is\ncompact and portable and can be set up\nat any test site, irrespective of landscape features, weather, or other environmental conditions.

Many components of the system\nwere salvaged from a system used to\nprotect the Apollo-Soyuz mobile\nlauncher.\nEngineering design studies for this\nproject have been collected in a\n150-page report. It contains a wealth of\ninformation both on the design of lightning protection systems and on instrumentation for monitoring the current\nwaveforms of lightning strokes. Also included are the results of examinations\n\nBooks and Reports\nThese reports , studies , and handbooks are avaOable from NASA as\nTechnical Support Packages (TSP\'s)\nwhen a Request Card number is\ncited ; otherwise they are available\nfrom the National Technical\nInformation Service .\n\nEngineering study could\nguide the design and\nmonitoring of lightning\nprotection.\nSevere environmental conditions, including hurricane-force winds and a\ncorrosive seacoast atmosphere, as\nwell as the need for a 10-year system\nlifetime were taken into account when\n\n182\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1982\n\nof the components of the earlier system\nthat had successfully sustained a direct\nlightning strike.\nBasically, the lightning protection\nsystem consists of a 1/2-inch (12.7\xc2\xb7mm)\nstainless-steel wire-rope catenary\ncable strung over the launchsite in a\nbroad inverted V. At the apex 390 ft\n(119 m) above ground, the cable is supported by a 65-ft (20-m) fiberglass insulating mast that is mounted atop a\nhammerhead crane. The cable is anchored at pOints 1,000 ft (305 m) on\neither side of the tower and is stretched\nto clear all grounded objects by at least\n50 ft (15 m). The cable is grounded at\neach end through current coils, which\nare part of the lightning currentmonitoring system.\nThe lightning current-monitoring system is designed to monitor the first\n100 lAs of each ligthning stroke; the current range is 2 to 200 kA. Current is\nmonitored via the voltage across the\ncoils at each end of the cable . The rate\nof change of current is monitored and\nintegrated to obtain the current. To protect the event recorders that monitor\nthe lightning strokes, the signals from\nthe transient recorder are transmitted\noptically to the data lines.\nVarious other structural and safety\nconsiderations were studied. Loads\nfrom hurricane-force winds impose\nrequirements more severe than those\ndue to launch conditions.\nFloodlighting of the mast was selected as the simplest economical way\nto provide aircraft safety warning . The\nreport also describes the testing of ablative coatings used to protect the mast\nfrom repeated exposure to the heating\neffects of Space Shuttle launches.\nThis work was done by Planning\nResearch Corp. for Kennedy Space\n\nCenter.

[See "Transducer\nSystem Traces Mine-Face Curve, "\n(MFS-25289), p. 424, [NASA Tech Briefs,\nVol. 6, No.4 (Spring/Summer 1982).]\nAngle transducers measure the angle\nbetween track sections as the longwall\nshearer proceeds along the coal face. A\ndistance transducer functions in conjunction with the angle transducers to\nobtain relative angles at known positions. When a cut is complete, the accumulated data are stored on cassette\ntape, and the track prOfile is computed\nand displayed. The angle and distance\ntransducers are intrinSically safe in the\npotentially hazardous environment of a\ncoal mine and therefore need no special\npackaging . The data storge and reduction electronics are not intrinSically safe\nbut are housed in an explosionproof\nenclosure.\n\nThe angle transducers are brush less\nresolvers in a support structure called\nthe angle cart. The transducers are\ndirectly connected to angle-measuring\nshoes. The angle between track sections is measured differentially by the\ntwo resolvers, which are attached to a\ncommon reference surface.\nDistance is measured by counting\npulses that originate from an optical encoder. The encoder is in a support structure called the distance cart. A five-point\nstar-whee I-type gear in the distance cart\nmakes contact with the track and rotates one-fifth of a revolution for each\n126 mm of forward travel. Gears transmit the star-wheel rotation to the encoder. The reference point from which\ndistance is measured is established by\nthe simultaneous activation of limit\nswitches and the encoder zero pulse.\nOnce the zero reference point is established, absolute distance is measured by\nan upldown counter, which accumulates pulses from the encoder as the\nshearer moves along the face.\nYet another transducer - for roll\nmeasurement - is contained within the\nexplosionproof enclosure. The transducer determines the deviation of the\nface from vertical. The transducer produces an electrical signal proportional\nto the angular displacement of a pendulum submerged in a damping fluid.\nA microprocessor in the explosionproof enclosure calculates the cut surface contour from the trigonometric\nrelations among track angles, distance,\nand roll measurements. The data reduction process for a 600-ft. (183-m) track\ntakes about 2 minutes.\nThis work was done by Benton Corp.\nfor Marshall Space Flight Center.

It analyzes a system on the\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1982\n\nbasis of incompressible flow even\nthough the system may contain either\ncompressible or incompressible fluid.\nThe program has been used to analyze\nSpace Shuttle orbiter hydtaulic systems\nused for environmental control and life\nsupport. The General Flow Distribution\nProgram solves fixed or variable flow\nproblems for series. parallel , or\nseries/parallel systems.\nA flow system is represented by a\nnodal network with elements of flow\nresistance. Either a closed network with\n(continued on next page)\n183\n\n0\n\npumps and fans or an open network with\na known total fixed flow rate may be\nanalyzed. The adjustment of variables is\npermitted through the use of usersupplied routines.\nThe analytical method is generally\nbased on the successive-approximation\nmethod. Flow across a resistance ,\nwhich may be either a duct, tube, or a\nblack box with known characteristics, is\ncalculated using the Bernoulli pressuredrop equation. Starting with assumed\npressures at active nodes, the program\niteratively corrects the pressures and\nflows until pressure and flow balance\ntests are satisfied. The balanced pressure drops and flows computed are output as analysis results.\nThis program is written in FORTRAN V\nfor batch execution and has been implemented on a CDC CYBER 170-series\ncomputer. As currently dimensioned to\naccommodate a network of up to 500\nnodes and 1,000 line elements, the program has a central memory requirement\nof approximately 17K (octal) of 60-bit\nwords.

The user supplies two small\nproblem--dependent programs to define\nthe design variables, constraints, and\nthe objective function . Unlike many\nother structural-optimization programs,\nthe design variables , constraints , and\nthe objective function can be represented in PROSSS by any choice of\nquantities, or combination of quantities,\nthat form input and output of structural\nanalysis. This allows the user to solve\n\n184\n\npractical optimization problems formulated in many different ways.\nExecution of the PROSSS analysisl\noptimization process results in a set of\noptimum design variables and a\nminimized objective function subject to\na set of constraints. Examples of the applications are (a) minimum-mass design\nwith cross-sectional areas as variables\nand stress constraints, or (b) the first\nnatural frequency as the objective function with overall shape design variables\nand stress and buckling constraints.\nPROSSS is intended to be used in the\nfollowing basic ways:\n- As a research tool for developing optimization techniques that will interface\nwith an efficient analysis program,\n- As a research tool for testing new\nanalysis techniques that will interface\nwith an efficient optimization program,\nand\n- As an application tool for a wide range\nof problems.\nWith PROSSS, the analysis and optimization programs are executed repeatedly in a loop until the process is\nstopped by a user--defined termination\ncriterion. This part of the system is referred to as the repeatable part of\nPROSSS. However, some of the analysis,\nsuch as model definition, need only be\ndone one time and can be sav~ for\nfuture use; these parts are performed\noutside of the loop and are referred to as\nthe nonrepeatable part of PROSSS. Five\noptions organize optimization procedures\nby combining nonlinear or piecewise\nlinear programing methods with analytic\nor finite--difference gradients.\nThe analysis is always performed on\nthe mainframe, a CDC 6000-series computer, because of the speed on the mainframe CPU. The end processor is also\nrun on the mainframe to reduce the large\namount of data generated by the analysis\nto the small amount of data required by\nthe optimizer. The optimizer may be run\non either the mainframe or the minicomputer, a PRIME 750 computer. The minicomputer offers the advantage of virtual\nmemory; for many applications the 0ptimizer requires a significant memory\nallocation. The primary difference in implementing PROSSS all on the CDC computer and in "distributing " part of\nPROSSS to the PRIME computer is the\nmethod of controlling the flow of the\noptions.\nPROSSS is written in FORTRAN IV for\nbatch execution and has been implemented on a CDC 6000-series computer and a PRIME 750 computer. The\n\nimplementation of PROSSS all on the\nCDC computer requires approximately\n100K (octal) of 60-bit words . The\nPROSSS user must have access to the\nCDC version of SPAR (available from\nCOSMIC).

A computer program\nwas developed as a structural-vibrationresponse data analysiS tool for use in the\ndynamic testing of the Space Shuttle.\nThe program provides a fast and efficient time-domain least-squares curvefitting procedure for reducing transient\nresponse data to obtain structural modal\nfrequencies and dampings from freedecay records. The procedure simultaneously identifies the frequencies,\ndamping values, and participaton factors for noisy multiple-response records.\nThe computer program and the methodology it is based on can be applied to the\nanalysis of transient response data for a\nwide range of structures and might also\nbe applied to such other areas as the\nanalysis of seismograms.\nThis program is written in FORTRAN\nIV for batch execution and has been implemented on an IBM 370-series computer with a central memory requirement of approximately 970K of 8-bit\nbytes.

The programs are composed of\nthree major models:\n- The Fleet Accounting Module,\n- The Airframe Manufacturer Module,\n- The Air Carrier Module.\nThe Fleet Accounting Module estimates the number of new aircraft required as a function of time to meet demand. This estimate is based primarily\nupon the expected retirement age of\nexisting aircraft and the expected\nchange in passenger-miles demand.\nFuel consumption estimates are also\ngenerated by this module.\nThe Airframe Manufacturer Module\nanalyzes the feasibility of manufacturing\nthe new aircraft. This module includes\nlogic for production scheduling and for\nestimating manufacturing costs. For a\nseries of aircraft selling prices, cash\nflow is analyzed, and rates of return on\ninvestment are calculated .\nThe Air Carrier Module is a tool for\nanalyzing the financial feasibility of an\nairline purchasing and operating the\nnew aircraft. This module includes a\nmethodology for computing direct and\nindirect operating costs, performing\ncash-flow analyses, and estimating the\ninternal rates of return on investment for\na set of aircraft purchase prices.\nInput to the Fleet Accounting Module\nincludes data describing growth rate of\nrevenue passenger miles and flight load\nfactors. Descriptions of currently\noperating aircraft are entered in terms\nof the year in which the aircraft became\noperational, seating capacity, fuel consumption, and normal retirement age.\nThe type, number, and age of aircraft\ncurrently in operation are entered to\ncomplete the description.

This versatile program allows for the configuration to be\npitched and rolled, and the fins may be\ndeflected. The tail fins may be interdigitated with respect to the foward fins.\nRns may have arbitrary plan form and\nthickness but must be planar. The load\ncalculations provide aerodynamic\nforces and moments acting on the entire\nconfiguration.\nNSWCDM treats the body and lifting\nsurfaces and performs vortex tracking\nalong the complete configuration in a\nsingle application. The theoretical approach is based on representing the\n\nconfiguration components by threedimensional singularities associated\nwith supersonic, linear flow theory.\nThe body\xc2\xb7is modeled by a distribution\nof supersonic line sources, sinks, and\ndoublets along the centerline. Constant\nu-velocity panels are laid out over the\nfins. Interference-containing constant\nu-velocity panels are placed around the\nbody over a length at least equal to the\nfin root chord to account for finbody interference. Forebody vortex shedding is\nmodeled by two potential flow vortexes\nwith strengths and positions obtained\nfrom an analytical/empirical approach.\nCanard fin trailing-edge vorticity is\ncalculated and tracked along the afterbody and tail with or without the body\nnose vortexes.

This corrected\nlinearized-theory method accounts for\nnonlinearities in the variation of basic\npressure loadings with local surface\nslopes, predicts the degree of attainment of theoretical leading-edge thrust\nforces, and estimates detached leadingedge vortex loadings that result when\nthe theoretical thrust forces are not fully\nrealized.\nThe comparison of LTSTAR computations with experimental results show\nsignificant improvements in detailed\nwing-pressure distributions, particularly\nfor large angles of attack and for regions\nof the wing where the flow is highly\nthree-dimensional. The program provides generally improved predictions of\n\nthe wing overall force and moment coefficients. LTSTAR could be useful in design studies aimed at aerodynamic performance optimization and in providing\nmore-realistic tradeoff information for\nthe selection of wing plan form geometry\nand airfoil section parameters.\nInput to the LTSTAR program includes wing planform data, free-stream\nconditions, wing camber, wing thickness, scaling options, and output options.

FATOLA represents an airplane either as a rigid body with six degrees of freedom or as a flexible body\nwith multiple degrees of freedom. The\nairframe flexibility is represented by the\nsuperposition of up to 20 free vibration\n\nmodes on the rigid-body motions. The\nanalysis includes maneuver logic and\nautopilots programed to control the aircraft during glide slope, flare, landing,\nand takeoff. The program is modular so\nthat the performance of the aircraft in\nflight and during landing and ground\nmaneuvers can be studied separately or\nin combination .\nNine effects are simulated in\nFATOLA:\n1.

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nA hand-held container accepts a\nmeasured amount of liquid from a pressurized supply. The supply pressure\ndrives a spring-loaded piston that stores\nenough mechanical energy to discharge\nthe measured liquid into another container . An operator triggers the discharge by turning a valve handle.\nThe container, shown in Figure 1, attaches to a water (or other fluid) supply\nthrough a "quick-<lisconnect" fitting.\nThe desired amount of fluid is selected\nby turning a collar that controls the\nlength of the piston travel.\nA three-way selector valve is set at\n"fill," "discharge," or "off." When the\nselector is set to " fill," the piston is\nforced back to the preset volume . After\nthe selector is turned to "discharge," a\nspring-loaded toggle valve triggers the\ndelivery of water to its final destination.\nThe device is stored safely in the "off"\nposition when it is full .\nThe spring is long enough to apply\nnearly constant force against the piston\nover its operating range.

It would center the\nparts to be joined, clamp them, and then\ntighten them into a single unit. Potential\napplications for the removable fastener\ninclude holding parts for welding, brazing, soldering, riveting, and gluing. Other\npossible uses would be for attaching\nremovable panels and panels with poor\naccess on one side and for plugging\nleaks in pressure vessels.\nThe fastener consists of a springloaded hexagonal actuating pin, six\nspringy collet fingers, and a hexagonalnut locking collar. The collet fingers\nclamp the fastener in position and\nshould give. excellent shear- and\nmoment-Ioad-carrying capacity. An adjustable locking collar compensates for\ncomponent assemblies of differing\nthicknesses.\nThe figure shows the fastener before\nand after locking. Holes are first drilled\nin the parts to accept the fastener. With\nthe spring-loaded actuating pin retracted, the six fingers remain together,\nand the fastener is inserted into the\nassembly.

The\nmechanical versatility also simplifies the\npositioning of work fixtures, thus reducing setup time and costs.\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1982\n\nMany of the features of the machine\nmay be seen in the figure. The large size\nof the EDM is apparent: The ram has a\ntraverse of 36 inches (91 cm), and the\ntable working surface is 44 by 44 inches\n(112 by 112 cm).

The\ngage, a simple screw-and-washer combination (see figure), detects the\nlongitudinal stresslstrain on the bolt; it\nrequires no electronic or sonic test\nequipment.\nThe strain gage is based on setting\nand maintaining a maximum longitudinal\n" stretch " that the bolt or stud should\nhave under the desired load or stress.\nTh is " stretch " can be either calculated\nor determined by calibration .\nThe gage screw is fed through a\ncruciform washer and installed in a\ndrilled hole through the centerline of the\nbolt or stud. The precise bolt " stretch "\nlength is set between the washer and\nscrewhead by a feeler gage or other\nsimple measuring device, and a jamnut\nlocks in the gap setting.\nThe gage screw is made of the same\nmaterial as the bolt to avoid thermalexpansion problems. When the bolt is\nproperly stressed, the gage screwhead\nclamps the washer and prevents it from\nrotating, indicating that proper tightening has been achieved. Subsequent inspections require only an attempt to\nrotate the washer by hand or with a tool.\nThe cruciform shape makes it easy to\ngrip the washer. If the washer is tight,\nthe bolt is properly loaded. The gage\nscrew may be longer than the bolt, as\nshown, or the gage screw length may be\nshorter than the bolt, such that sufficient\nstretch is measured to ensure that tolerances do not adversely affect accuracy.\nOther methods depend primarily on\nmeasurement of the torque imposed on\nthe nut or bolthead.

The Parachute Line Hook includes a tapered brass fitting that expands locking loops on the parachute bag so that the\nparachute lines can be pulled through them.\n\nUsing a modified line hook developed\nat Langley Research Center, one person\nnow packs parachutes for test recovery\nvehicles faster than it previously took a\ntwo-person team. The new line hook includes an expander that opens up two\nlocking loops so that the parachute lines\ncan be pulled through them. In the old\nmethod, one person operated the line\nhook while the other person expanded\nthe loops by hand.\nThe parachutes are packed at high\npressure because they have to be compressed into the limited space available\nin the test vehicles. The pressure\ncreates a large force on the parachute\nlocking flaps.\nTwo flaps at the mouth of the\nparachute bag are joined together to\nlock the parachute in the bag.

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nA pressure regulator for oxygen\nallows gas flow to be shut off on its lowpressure (outlet) side rather than its\nhigh-pressure (inlet) side. The regulator\nthus avoids the fire hazard associated\nwith the rapid pressurization and consequent adiabatic heating of oxygen on\nthe input side when the regulator is\nturned on. The new regulator can reduce the danger of fire in aircraft and in\nmedical oxygen supplies.\nAs originally designed, the shutoff\nvalve of the pressure regulator was\nupstream of a two-stage pressure\nreducer. Opening the shutoff valve\ncaused sudden pressurization of the\nsmall volume between the shutoff valve\nand the first stage. The heat of pressurization could not be dissipated rapidly,\nand the temperature of the gas in the\nsmall volume soared to potentially\ndangerous levels.\nIn the new version of the regulator\n(see figure), the shutoff valve is\neliminated from the supply side, and its\nfunction is transferred to a lift rod . With\nthe lift rod in the up (off) position, the\nregulator valve stem floats freely, and\nthe inlet pressure holds the valve ball\nagainst the regulator valve seat.\nHowever, when the lift rod is pushed\ndown to a position that frees the\npressure-sensing bellows plate, the\nplate can move against the valve stem\nin response to outlet pressure. The\ndevice then functions as a normal\nregulator. When the regulator is turned\non, the oxygen flows suddenly into a\nlarge volume instead of a small one:\nThere is no rapid buildup of pressure\nand temperature .\nThis work was done by Charles\nSimons of United Technologies Corp.\nand Lawrence Gill of Carlton Controls\nfor Johnson Space Center.

The Gap Filler Is Removed by\nundercutting the adhesive alternately\nfrom one end and then from the other end\nof the filler.\n\nA new tool enters a narrow gap between fragile materials and removes an\nadhesively bonded filler without damage\nto the adjacent surfaces. It reaches\ndeep into narrow crevices to reach hidden bond lines. The tool was originally\ndeveloped to remove ceramic filler from\nbetween the Space Shuttle surfaceinsulation tiles.\nThe tool (see Figu re 1) has two blades\nthat support a short length of music wire,\n0.016 in.

In the\n\nSpace Shuttle application, only the\nlength of music wire is used to sever the\nadhesive bonds; the blades do not actually do any cutting.\nAs shown in Figure 2, the tool is inserted over the filler to be removed with\nthe two blades straddling the filler. Any\nadhesive bonds between the filler and\nadjacent walls are broken by a sharpened spatula before the tool Is inserted.\nThe wire is inserted down to the bond\nline and pulled with a slight downward\npressure along the gap filler, stopping\nabout 2 in.

The path\n\nof the tool is then reversed , and the tool\nis removed at the same place it entered.\nThe tool is then reinserted at the opposite end of the gap filler, and the last\nremaining bond is severed.

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nA proposed design for a hybrid highvoltage power-circuit package uses a\nmolded plastic for hermetic sealing instead of a glass-to-metal seal. The new\npackage would be used to house highvoltage regulators and solid-state switches for applications in aircraft, electr:c\nautomobiles, industrial equipment , satellites, solar-cell arrays, and other equipment in extreme environments.\nThe design shown in the figure could\nhouse four semiconductor chips, each\n0.25 inch (6.4 mm) square, dissipating\n40 watts to a heat sink. The package\ncould operate at up to 1,000 Vdc in air or\nvacuum at temperatures from that of liquid nitrogen up to 500 0 F (260 0 C). By\nmodifying the package size, the design\ncould be adapted for higher or lower\npower dissipation or to accommodate\nentire hybrid circuit chip assemblies\ncomprising transistors, diodes, resistors, or thryristors.\nThe package consists of a copper\nheat-sink base, a plastic ring frame, and\na cover plate. Gold-plated copper wire\nleads are molded into the sidewalls of\nthe ring frame for stability and hermetic\nsealing. The ring frame is attached to the\nheat sink with pins. The pins are molded\ninto the heat-sink base when the ring\nframe is molded onto it, forming a\nhermetic seal. After the hybrid circuits\nhave been mounted in the package, the\npackage cover is hermetically sealed in\nplace with soft solder. To provide a\nsoldering surface on the plastic, the inside edge of the cover and the top of the\nring frame are plated with copper.\nThe 90 0 bend in the molded-in leads\nprevents them from rotating and causing the package to leak under thermal or\nmechanical shock. Such shocks sometimes cause conventional metal- or\nceramic-cased assemblies to fracture.\nThe molded plastiC has been selected\nfor its excellent dimensional stability,\nresistance to heat and radiation, and\ngood mechanical strength.

The technique utilizes the reflective layer as a\nheating element and saves the production costs of applying or embedding\nheating elements in ordinary glass. The\nresulting panels have many applications, including automobile windows,\nhome-heating panels, temperature-controlled windows or containers, and foodwarming trays. The glass can be maintained indefinitely at temperatures in excess of 100 0 C.\nArchitectural reflective glass is usually made by coating clear glass with a\nmetallic film that in turn is covered by a\nthin protective film. In the conversion\nprocess, an electric potential applied\nbetween two places on the film surface\n(see figure) breaks down the high-resistance outer protective layer and brings\nthe reflective film into electrical contact\nwith electrodes on the surface.

The purpose was to improve the compositional\nuniformity of the sprayed coating and to\n\nobtain a process that could be used by\nvendor organizations in preparing and\napplying these powders and coatings.\nThe coating was NASA-developed lubricant PS 106, which has the nominal\ncomposition by weight of 35 silver, 35\nNichrome, and 30 calcium fluoride.\n\nPrevious methods for plasma-spray\napplication of multicomponent coatings\nhad been simply to premix powders of\nthe various components and to place\nthem in a hopper from which they were\nfed to the plasma torch and sprayed onto the surface to be coated. Another ap.\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1982\n\n(continued on next page)\n\n209\n\nproach had been to supply the different\npowders separately to the torch by\nmeans of a multifeed system. Mixing occurred in the torch.\nThe disadvantages of the prior methods are as follows: (1) Premixed powders of components with different densities tended to segregate when the powders were vibrated, when they flowed\nthrough the powder feedlines, and when\nthey were sprayed. The fact that powders manufactured for plasma spraying\nare designed for easy flow and that\noften all the component powders are of\nabout the same particle-size range only\naggravated the segregation problem.\n(2) Using separate feeds for the various\ncomponents tended to seriously complicate the entire system, especially\nwhen more than two powder components were involved. Also the feed\nrates of powders were difficult to control\naccurately over a period of time;\ntherefore coating compositions were difficult to control by this approach .\nIt appeared feasible to reduce segregation of such powders by using varia-\n\ntions in particle size or by the use of\nsuitable binders. Mixtures of particle\nsizes promote agglomeration, and small\nparticles may adhere to larger ones,\ncreating a pseudocomposite particle.\nSuch a " particle " might remain essentially intact during the plasma-spraying\nprocess. Alternately, binders would be\nused to improve the between-particle\nstrength of such particle aggregations.\nThe object was to introduce sufficient\nbinder to the particle-connecting necks\nto achieve maximum strength.\nThere were two significant steps that\nminimized powder segregation and permitted the coating to be plasma-sprayed\nonto a surface without segregation of\nthe components:\n1. Very fine (typically 5-micrometer) particle-size powders of selected components were mixed dry with coarser\nparticles (typically 50 to 150 micrometers) of the other components. The\nvery fine particles tended to adhere to\nthe large particles and thus to reduce\nsegregation.\n2. A small percentage (2 to 6 weight\npercent) of monoaluminum phosphate\n\n(MAP) aqueous concentrate was added to the powder along with sufficient\nadditional water to form a stirrable\nslurry. Upon drying, the powder was in\nthe form of a cake in which the particles were loosely held together with\nthe MAP acting as a binder. The powder cake was then broken and passed\nthrough a sieve. The sieved powders\nconsisted of multicomponent aggregate particles. The aggregate particles\nreadily flowed through the plasmaspray system and were sprayed with\nlittle or no tendency to segregate into\nthe various components.\nThis work was done by H. E. Sliney and\nT. P. Jacobson of Lewis Research\nCenter and G. C. Walther and H.

Bubbles are either\nabsorbed or brought to the surface by\napplying a high-intensity sonic field at a\nresonant frequency. In one method, a\nswept frequency resonant to bubbles of\nvarious sizes is used; and in the second,\nseveral resonant modes in an acoustic\nchamber are applied. The methods\ncould be applied to the production of\nmolds and optical-quality glass.\nThe first method reshapes the bubbles at their resonant frequency to increase their exposed surfaces to new\nareas of the liquid and to induce liquid\ncirculation around the bubbles, thus encouraging molecular absorption. The intensity of the acoustic waves , which\n\nmay be above 160 dB, depends on the\ndensity of the fluid.\nIn the second method (see figure), the\nliquid is placed in an acoustic resonance\nchamber. A succession of resonant\nmodes of the chamber is applied, from\nthe higher order modes down to the fundamental. At each frequency, the bubbles migrate to the oscillation nodes; as\nthe frequency is decreased, the number\nof nodes decreases, and the bubbles\ntend to coalesce. Eventually they are\nmoved to the liquid/gas interface.\nThis work was done by Eugene Trinh ,\nDaniel D. Elleman, and Taylor G. Wang\nof Caltech for NASA\'s Jet Propulsion\nLaboratory.

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nNew firefighter\'s gloves are more\nflexible and more comfortable than previous designs. Since some firefighters\nprefer gloves made of composite materials while others prefer dip-coated\ngloves, both types were developed (see\nfigure). The new gloves may also find\nuses in foundries, steelmills, and other\nplants where they can be substituted for\nasbestos gloves.\nAn aramid fabric was selected as the\nmaterial for the outer shell of the composite glove because it is strong and resistant to flame and heat. It is also flexible, dries rapidly, and retains its flexibility after repeated wetting and drying.\nThe palm side is a durable tightly woven\ntwill. The back of the shell is a knit.\nFor the liner, aramid felt was selected\nbecause it is puncture-resistant and\nthermally insulating. A neoprene film 4 to\n5 mils (0.10 to 0.13 millimeter) thick on\nthe palm side of the liner helps to prevent the rapid conduction of heat; the\nfilm is flexible and flame-retardant.\nWristlets 4 inches (10 centimeters)\nlong protect the wearer\'s wrists. A felt\npatch increases the protection on the\npalm side of the wristlet.\nFor the dip-coated glove, the shell is\ncoated with a yellow, flame-retardant\nneoprene layer. A friction layer on the\npalm side improves the wearer\'s grip.\nThe yellow dip coating shields against\nradiant heat better than a dark-colored\ncoating.\nThe wristlet for the dip-coated glove\nconsists of an aramid knit outer layer\nand a knit cotton underlayer. The underlayer prevents penetration of the dip\n\nTwo Versions of New Firefighter\'s Gloves accommodate individual preference. The palm\nof the glove outer shell is a twill, and the back is a knit.

A patch of\naramid felt gives additional protection to\nthe palm side of the wrist.\nBoth types of gloves were tested for\nconformance to standards of the National Institute for Occupational Safety\nand Health (NIOSH). Both met the cutresistance criterion - that is, they sustained no cuts with a 16-pound\n(71-newton) load on a test blade. Puncture tests were conducted on the palm\nside of the gloves. Both types provided\nalmost double the recommended\n13.2-pound (59-newton) puncture\nresistance.\nThe standards state that a glove\nshould protect against the injurythreshold temperature for 5 seconds.\nThe composite glove exceeded the\n\nthreshold after 4.6 seconds.

Using an explosive joining\n\ntechnique demonstrated at Langley Research Center, however, the repairs are\nmade remotely, resulting in a joint that is\ndouble the strength of the parent metal.\n\nIn the initial assembly of the reactor,\neach fuel channel (a total of 390) is manually fusion-welded to a bellows assembly (Figure 1) on the reactor face\n(continued on next page)\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1982\n\n211\n\nthrough a thin-walled low-carbon-steel\nadapter flange_ To remove each fuel\nchannel, the fusion weld is severed , the\nfuel-channel plumbing disconnected,\nand the fuel channel disconnected from\nthe end-plate fitting on the opposite\nreactor face. A new fuel-channel assembly with adapter must be inserted into\nthe bellows assembly and reinstalled.\nIn the explosive joining technique, the\nadapter flange from the fuel channel is\nmachined to incorporate a V-notch interface, shown in Figure 2. The ribbon explosive, V2 inch (1.3 cm) in width, drives\nthe V-notched wall of the adapter into\nthe bellows assembly, producing an\natomic-level metallurgical bond . A\n0.030-inch (0.08-cm) wall thickness for\nthe adapter flange , driven by a\n30-grain/foot (0.63-gram/cm) explosive\nribbon charge, yields a jOint with twice\nthe bond area needed to achieve parent\nmetal strength (a 200-percent joint). A\nmachine surface of 64 rms yields\n200-percent-strength joints, but a\n32-rms finish is needed to achieve a\nhermetic seal. Degreasing is necessary;\nwet wiping with standard no-deposit\nsolvents, such as alcohol or Freon , is\nsufficient.\nAn acceptable but considerably\nweaker joint is made without the anvilring supporting structure. The anvil ring\nprevents tube distortion, allowing more\nof the explosive energy to be utilized. An\nacceptable but weaker jOint was created with a fuel-channel adapter flange\nundersized in diameter by 0.060 inch\n(0.15 cm). The joint is unaffected by heat\nloads from the reactor as demonstrated\nby 100 thermal shocks from 570 0 F\n(300 0 C) to ambient.\n\nFigure 1.

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nA new replaceable carbon insert for\nthe deflection coil in an electron\xc2\xb7beam\nwelder promises to decrease mainte\xc2\xb7\nnance costs. Inserts made from materi\xc2\xb7\nals other than carbon (not yet tried) may\nbe less expensive, thus reducing costs\neven further.\nDuring electron-beam welding, metal\nvapors condense on the inside wall of\nthe deflection coil through which the\nelectron beam passes. A metal film\nbuilds up gradually. If the metal is mag\xc2\xb7\nnetic, it interferes with the operation of\nthe deflection coil, and the beam does\nnot respond to commands as it should.\nThe usual maintenance practice has\nbeen to overhaul the deflection coil reg\xc2\xb7\nularly, cleaning metal film from the in\xc2\xb7\nside wall and recoating it with a pro\xc2\xb7\ntective layer of colloidal graphite. After\nseveral such cleanings, the colloidal\ngraphite no longer adheres, and the de\xc2\xb7\nflection coil has to be discarded.\n\nThe new insert is a cylindrical sleeve\nmachined from carbon rod. The diame\xc2\xb7\nter is carefully controlled to assure a\nsnug fit in the deflection coil. Since car\xc2\xb7\nbon is nonmagnetic, the sleeve does not\ninterfere with coil operation.\nThe sleeve is much easier to clean\nthan are conventional protective coat\xc2\xb7\nings. Metal deposits are brushed away,\nand the sleeve is then returned to\nservice.\nThe carbon sleeve Is in regular pro\xc2\xb7\nduction use. It reduces welder downtime\nfor coil cleaning and extends the useful\nlife of deflection coils.\nThis work was done by William L.\nBaker and Clifton E.

Each thrustor has to be\nwrapped with fibers able to withstand\n2,500 0 F (1 ,370 0 C) and having the proper density so that the temperatures of\nthrustor components can be kept within\nsafe limits.\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1982\n\nIn one installation method, layers of\nuncured phenolic\xc2\xb7impregnated batting\nin various shapes are wound around a\nmold and then compressed to the reo\nquired density by a mandrel. The mold\nand insulation are then heated to 425 0 F\n(218 0 C) to cure and evaporate part of\nthe binder. The insulation has the minimum practical binder content - 4\xc2\xb71/2\npercent, just enough to prevent the parts\nfrom breaking up in transit. The rest of\nthe binder is volatilized after installation,\nwhen the thrustor is heated to 600 0 F\n(316 0 C) for 48 hours.\n\nThe second method uses no resin . In\xc2\xb7\nstead, the insulation is compressed in a\nmold and saturated with water. The wet\ninsulation is then frozen in the shipping\ncontainer.

The low broad-area current densities and 1.3-llm CW operation\nat room temperature indicate that InP/InGaAsP/lnP laser structures with characteristics comparable to present\nstate-of-the-art structures can be\ngrown on the (110) InP substrates.\nPrevious studies of liquid-phase epitaxyof InGaAsP alloy on (110) surfaces\nof III-V semiconductor substrates had\nshown layers containing nonwetting defects and terracing .

The (110) surfaces\nwere comparable to or slightly better\nthan the (100) surfaces in physical\nappearance, including layer thickness\nand interface planarity.\nImproved surface quality and grownlayer morphology are attributable to the\nnearly-perfect surface stoichiometry of\nthe (110) surface [not available on (100)\n\nsubstrates], which makes available\nequal numbers of In and P deposition\nsites.

The relatively low\ntemperature of the CVD process (500 0\nto 900 0 C) reduces stresses that occur\nat the layerlsubstrate interface during\ngrowth and cooling .

The\ngrowth method is such that the completed solar cell is easily separated by\ncleaving from the much thicker substrate. The resulting 10-micrometerthick cell is 90 percent thinner and 77\npercent lighter than the thinnest silicon\nsolar cell . Furthermore, the thick sub\xc2\xb7\nstrate is reusable in making additional\ncells, which reduces cell material cost.\nThe greatly-reduced material usage in\nthe CLEFT process results in material\ncosts for GaAs cells that are compar\xc2\xb7\nable to the costs for silicon cells currently used in space. Since GaAs cells are\nmore efficient (18 percent) than silicon\ncells (14 percent) and also more\nradiation -resistant , the process will\nmake GaAs cells more practical for\nspace applications, as well as for uses\nhere on Earth.\n\nThe CLEFT process allows a drastic\nreduction in the usage of GaAs.

The blades cut\nhorizontally while the ingots rotate about\ntheir vertical axes. Rotation of the ingots\nincreases the net cutting speed and\nreduces by half the depth to which a\nblade must penetrate an ingot to sever a\nwafer . As a result, the production of\nwafers for a given run is higher, even for\nmoderate or low blade-rotation speeds\nand feed rates. Lower speeds and rates\nshould produce fewer broken wafers.\nEither inside-diameter or outsidediameter blades may be used (Figure 1).\nPairs of ingots are positioned symmetrically around the cutting edge. The\nopposing-pair arrangement helps to\nbalance the forces on the blade, thereby\nreducing vibation, improving wafer\nquality, and further reducing wafer\nbreakage. Four, six, eight, or more ingots may be cut simultaneously, provided that the number is made up of\nopposed pairs.\nThe ingots are fed radially toward the\ncenter of rotation of the blade if cutting\nis done on the outside circumference of\nthe blade and radially away from the\ncenter if cutting is done on an inside circumference. The rotation of the ingots\nabout their vertical axes should be in the\nsame sense as that of the cutting blade\nfor outside cutting and in the opposite\nsense for inside cutting.\nThe rotation greatly reduces the cutting contact area. Since the contact\npressure for effective cutting remains\nessentially unchanged, the reduced\narea makes it possible to slice a large\nnumber of wafers simultaneously without imposing excessive loads on the\nmachine. Similarly, the thrust applied to\neach ingot is not unduly large, and bending of the ingots - which are supported\nonly by their upper ends - is reduced.\nA further advantage of ingot rotation\nis that it aids in the removal of debris.\nSilicon chips and abrasive particles\nquickly slide off the spinning wafer sur-\n\n216\n\nFigure 1.

Blade Edges are Staggered so that final severance proceeds in rapid succession rather than all at once. Blades shown here are part of a 250-blade stack. Each edge is\ndisplaced 0.004 inch (0.1 mm) from the blade below it, for a total displacement of 1 inch\n(25.4 mm) between the topmost and bottommost edges.\n\nface . A potential source of wafer damage and blade wear is thus eliminated,\nand the flow of coolant over the cut is\npromoted.\nThe stacked blades must handle the\ncut wafers properly to avoid damage.\nThe wafers should leave each ingot from\nthe bottom first in an upward progression. Therefore each blade should have\na slightly different diameter from that of\nits neighbors (Figure 2). If slicing is done\nby the outside edge of the blade, the\ndiameter of the lowest blade must be\nslightly larger than that of the blade immediately above it, and so on up the\nstack. If cutting is done on the inside\n\nedge, the cutting hole in the lowest blade\nmust be slightly smaller than the cutting\nhole in the blade just above it.\nThe small cutting contact area, the\nslow feed rate, and the relatively-low\nrotational speed of the blades may mean\nthat slicing an individual wafer takes a\nlonger time with the new concept.\nHowever, the longer time is more than\ncompensated by the large number of ingots that can be cut simultaneously.\nThis work was done by Yu Shen Kuo\nof Caltech for NASA\'s Jet Propulsion\nLaboratory_For further information, Circle 57 on the TSP Request Card.\n\nNPO-15483\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1982\n\nGrowing Silicon Ribbon Horizontally\nA faster growth rate is just one\nadvantage over vertical drawing.\nNASA\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California\nHorizontal growth of silicon ribbon\noffers several advantages over vertical\ngrowth. It woud be faster - possibly 1 to\n2 centimeters per second - and could\nbe done without using drawing dies, a\nsource of contamination in vertical\ngrowth. The horizontal process would\nnaturally create a doping profile (de\xc2\xb7\ncreasing dopant concentration toward\nthe top surface), and it lends itself to\ncontinuous removal of impurities from\nthe silicon melt.\nIn the proposed horizontal-growth\nprocess, a seed crystal is introduced\ninto a crucible of molten silicon and withdrawn horizontally, carrying with it a\ncontinuous ribbon of newly-solidified single-crystal silicon (see figure). A longterm goal is to pull ribbons 3 1/2 to 7 mils\n(0.09 to 0.18 millimeter) in thickness at\nrates of 1 to 2 centimeters per second.\nSuch a high growth rate is possible\nbecause the horizontal orientation offers\na relatively large area for the rejection of\nheat by radiation, forced or natural\natmospheric convection , and by conduction and convection from the solidifying ribbon to the liquid below it. In contrast, the heat-rejection area available\nfor vertical growth is merely the crosssectional area of the ribbon.\nThe meniscus under the moving ribbon at the crucible will leak slightly\nunder certain conditions. If the leakage\nis carefully controlled, such spillover\ncan be turned to advantage: It removes\nthe impurity-laden top layer of the melt,\npreventing impurities from building up.\nThe spilled silicon can be purified and\nrecyled.\n\nA Solid Ribbon of Silicon is pulled horizontally over the lip of a crucible. As heat leaves the\nsilicon by radiation, conduction, and convection, the surface layer solidifies from the\nliquid.\n\nThe combined effects of thermal diffusion in the solidifying ribbon and the\nconvection induced in the melt by the\nhorizontal ribbon motion result in a\ndopant-concentration gradient near the\nsurface. As a result, the top (first-togrow) surface of the ribbon contains a\nminimum dopant concentration. The\ndopant density increases with distance\nbelow the top surface, reaching a maximum at the bottom (Iast-to-grow) surface of the ribbon. The low/high-dopant\ndistribution provides a built-in back-surface field - a desirable feature because it makes solar cells more efficient. The top, low-doped ribbon surface\nis used as the top of a solar cell. The\nlightly doped region forms a collecting\njunction that places the material with the\nhighest recombination lifetime in the\nregion of greatest solar-energy absorption. The heavily-doped bottom surface\n\nreduces the series resistance of the cell.\nTo establish the utlimate horizontaldrawing rates for high-quality silicon ribbon , seeded-growth behavior will have\nto be studied. The rate of surface growth\nat the leading edge appears to be the\nfactor limiting the drawing rate. A variable-flow jet of helium or argon gas at\nthe leading growth edge may help; the\njet will cool the solidifying ribbon more\nrapidly, thus allowing it to be pulled more\nquickly.\n[For a related article, see "Technique\nfor Crystal-Ribbon Growth " (NPO15177) on page 93 of NASA Tech Briefs,\nVol. 7, No. 1.]\nThis work was done by John A.\nZoutendyk of caltech for NASA\'s Jet\nPropulsion Laboratory.

As the interface moves\nup or down, the average intensity in the\nwindow increases or decreases above\nor below a reference intensity level that\ncorresponds to the desired position.

The\nends of the die through which the silicon\nsheet is drawn as a ribbon from molten\nsilicon must be held at a temperature\nonly slightly above the solidification\npoint of silicon. In older systems with\npoor temperature-gradient control operating near the freezing point, the ribbon\noften solidifies prematurely, freezing to\nthe die at its ends. The ribbon breaks\nand must be restarted.\nNow, however, a " cold shoe" with\ncontours that are specially shaped\n\npromises to solve the freezing problem.\nThe cold shoe, which extracts heat from\nthe ribbon as it emerges from the die\n(see figure) thus affords a further means\nof controlling the die-top temperature, in\naddition to the active control provided by\ndie heaters and the passive control provided by the shape of the die itself.\nWhereas in previously-designed cold\nshoes, the distance h between the die\ntop and the cold shoe and the height t of\nthe flat face of the cold shoe are constant, in the new profiled cold shoe,\nthese dimensions are variable.\nWith the profile dimensions indicated\nin the figure, the laterai temperature gra-\n\ndient in the ribbon disappeared, and the\ntendency of the emerging ribbon to\nfreeze prematurely - at its ends before\nits center - therefore disappeared too.\nThe ribbon grew smoothly at a rate of\n3 cm per minute with a uniformly high\nmeniscus across its width and welldeveloped stable ends.\n\nThis work was done by Brian\nMackintosh of Mobil Tyco Solar Energy\nCorp. for NASA\'s Jet Propulsion\nLaboratory.

When the chamber is excited at harmonics of the fundamental, additional variable\xc2\xb7position zones are created.\nA method of acoustic levitation supports objects at positions other than the\nacoustic nodes. Acoustic force is varied\nso that it balances gravitational (or\nother) force, thereby maintaining an object at any position within an equilibrium\nrange. When the acoustic frequency is\nthe fundamental resonance of the\nacoustic chamber , the equ ilibrium\nrange is one-fourth of the chamber\nlength (see figure).\nThe levitation method is applicable to\ncontainerless processing. In a levitation\nfurnace, for example, it could be used to\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1982\n\nmanipulate specimens without contacting them, perhaps moving them through\na temperature gradient.\nThe acoustic levitation depends upon\nthe sample height, z, and chamber vertical length, L, according to a function\nthat is proportional to sin(2nNz/L), where\nN = the order of the harmonic of the\nfundamental chamber frequency. In the\n1), the maxifundamental mode (N\nmum upward acoustic force occurs at\nz\nLl4. Above this height, the lifting\nforce decreases with increasing height\n(as with an object supported by a\n\n=\n\n=\n\nspring). When this maximum force is\ngreater than or equal to the opposing\nforce (gravity), a sample will levitate at or\nabove the Ll4 poSition. Thus, Ll4 is the\nminimum height at which an object can\nbe supported in equilibrium. Above Ll2,\nthe force of gravity acts on the specimen\nin the same direction as the acoustic\nforce, and further levitation is resisted.\nA specimen is placed in an acoustic\nchamber excited at its fundamental\nmode. The acoustic amplitude (and thus\nthe acoustic force) is increased until it is\n(continued on next page)\n\n219\n\njust sufficient to hold the specimen at a\nheight of Ll4. The acoustic amplitude is\nincreased further until the sample rises\nto the desired position, anywhere between Ll4 and Ll2. Given the densities\nof the sample and gas medium, the equilibrium position between these two\npoints can be determined from the\nacoustic pressure. There are additional\nregions of equilibrium if the chamber is\n\nexcited by harmonics of the fundamental frequency.\nA variable force such as an electrostatic force can be substituted for\ngravity and used to vary the position of a\nlevitated specimen. If the variable force\ncan be both positive and negative, the\nzones of equilibrium will be extended to\ntwice their size in a unidirectional field\nand will become continuous.\n\nSuch objects as table-tennis balls,\nhollow plastic spheres, and balsa-wood\nspheres have been levitated in the\nlaboratory by the new method.\nThis work was done by Martin B.\nBarmatz, James D. Stoneburner, Nathan\nJacobi, and Taylor G.

Three independent axes of rotation would be available, leading to rotation of the levitated object about any\nother selected axis.\nExisting acoustic levitation systems\nuse two degenerate (equal-frequency)\nfundamental acoustic modes for both\nsample levitation and rotation. Sample\nstability (nonrotation state) requires the\ndegenerate mode frequencies to be exactly inphase or out-of-phase. A phase\ndifference gives rise to viscous torques\nthat cause rotation [see "Viscous\nTorques on a Levitating Body"\n(NPO-15413), page 56, NASA Tech\nBriefs, Vol. 6, No. 1 (Spring 1981)]. However, these systems are not efficient if\nthe intent is to control or to prevent the\nrotation of the sample during high-temperature materials processing.\nIn the proposed system, the sample is\nlevitated by using nondegenerate fundamental frequencies that do not cause\nrotation . Rotation is introduced either by\nadjusting the chamber dimensions to\nproduce higher-frequency degenerate\nnormal modes or by exciting degenerate\nnormal modes in a chamber with specific length ratios.\nAs an example, consider the rectangular chamber of the figure, with sides of\nlength lx, Iy, and Iz. The frequency of the\nnx, ny, nz mode is given by\nfI(n)2\n\nfnxnynz =\nwhere c\n\n220\n\n~ ~ fx\n\n=\n\n+\n\nn 2\n\nn 2\n\nV2\n\n(~) + (~) J\n\nADJUSTABLE\nWALL\n\nA Rectangular Chamber With at Least One Movable Wan exhibits different acoustic normal modes, depending upon the chosen wall position. The manner of selecting modes\nand frequencies is analogous to that of tunable waveguides or musical instruments.\n\n=\n\n=\n\nIf Iyllx\n513 and Iz/l y\n517, then\nthere are three pairs of degenerate\nn.)rmal modes; namely, f300\nf050,\nf005, and f070\nf003\xc2\xb7 These\nf700\nmode pairs produce torques about the z,\ny, and x axes, respectively. The torques\ndepend on the amplitudes and relative\nphases of the two modes in the pairs.\nThe net acoustic torque on a levitated\nobject equals the vector sum of the\nacoustic torques applied by the mode\n\n=\n\n=\n\n=\n\npairs. If the three degenerate mode\npairs are excited as in the above example, the sample will rotate about an axis\nalined with the net torque, with a rotational speed dependent on the magnitude of that torque. While the concept is\nmost easily visualized for a chamber of\nrectangular cross section , it is applicable to any of the common shapes\nemployed for levitation chambers and\ntor which the normal modes are known .\n\nthe speed of sound.\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1982\n\nThe port through which a mode is excited must be positioned so as to feed\nenergy maximally to that mode while\nminimizing the coupling to the other\nmode of the same frequency.

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nThe electrical serviceability of a\ndamaged connector can sometimes be\nrestored by bonding loose contacts to\nthe connector insert with an adhesive.\nThe procedure eliminates the time-consuming operations of completely removing and replacing the faulty electrical\nconnector and then testing the affected\nwiring .\nA multi pin connector (shown in Figure\n1) that has removable contacts is widely\nused in large, integrated electronic\nsystems because it simplifies the\nassembly of complex harnesses. Each\nremovable contact is held in place by\nspring fingers that rest behind a\nshouldered section of the pin. Because\nthe fingers are integral with the plastic\ninsert of the connector, there is no way\nto replace or repair them if they become\ndamaged.\nIn the repair procedure , a hypodermic\nneedle is used (see Figure 2) to apply an\nepoxy adhesive in and behind the cavity\ncontaining the damaged locking finger.\nThe damaged connector does not have\nto be demated or removed from the\nharness to apply the epoxy.\nThe epoxy used (Hysol EA956 , or\nequivalent) is relatively thick: It will\nneither flow past the pin to the front face\nof the connector to contaminate the\ncontact, nor will it flow from the repair\nsite after the needle is removed. The\nepoxy fills the space around the base of\nthe contact to anchor it in position ,\nresulting in a permanent repair.\nThis work was done by William T.\nDean 1/1 and Eugene J.

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nA test jig checks whether the pins of a\nconnector are within location tolerance .\nThe jig greatly reduces test time . For a\n250-pin connector, for example, a test\nthat takes only 5 minutes with the jig\nrequires 4 hours with a toolmaker\'s\nmicroscope - the conventional way of\nchecking pin location.\nThe jig is a metal plate that makes\nelectrical contact with out-of-tolerance\npins but not with pins that are within\ntolerance. Parallel longitudinal slots are\ncut on one side of the aluminum plate,\nand parallel transverse slots are cut on\nthe other side (see figure). Since the\nslots are cut through slightly more than\nhalf the thickness of the plate, their intersections form rectangular holes.\nIn a test, the operator inserts the pins\nof a connector into the holes while the\nconnector body is located by dowels on\nthe plate. If a pin is misalined, it touches\nthe side of a hole. The operator scans\nthe tips of the pins one by one with a\nstylus. A pin touching the plate\nestablishes electrical continuity from the\nstylus through the plate to a buzzer or\nlamp, which provides a signal to the\noperator. The operator notes the location of misalined pins for later correction.\nJigs can be designed to accommodate a variety of pin patterns and\nshapes.

Particular at\xc2\xb7\ntention is paid to the heat flow due to a\nlaminar convection current in the melt\ninduced by the horizontal motion of a\nribbon-shaped semiconductor crystal\nbeing pulled from the melt.\nHorizontal growth allows higher\n"pull" rates than do vertical growth\ntechniques. This is because of the favorable ratio of the large ribbon area availNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1982\n\nable for heat removal to the small cross\xc2\xb7\nsectional area of the ribbon.\nBoth the motionally-induced and natural (thermally-induced) convection currents in the melt cause a thermal boundary layer to form adjacent to the liquid/solid interface. This causes a nonuniform heat flow from the melt.\nTreatment of the combined effects of\nboth natural and induced convection is\ncomplex and would have to be done by\nnumerical computation . However, careful control of melt temperature by judicious design of the melt crucible and its\nheating can minimize the effects of\nnatural convection. Therefore, in this investigation, only the effects due to the\nmotionally-induced convection current\nare considered.\nA series of different modes of ribbon\ncooling was analyzed to determine the\nrelationships between ribbon thickness,\npull rate, melt temperature, and cooling\nof the ribbon. For each mode the conditions for which ribbon pull would be\nstable have been investigated.\nUnder some conditions ribbon thickness is unstable, tending toward zero\nthickness: a condition that results in ribbon pullout. This occurs if too little active\n(forced convective) cooling is provided\nat the thin tip of the ribbon or where\nthere is too little passive cooling of the\nrest of the ribbon surface.\nWith such mixed cooling, the ribbon\nmay increase in thickness in the actively\ncooled region only to remelt partially in\nthe passively cooled region if heat flow\nfrom the melt exceeds passive heat loss.\nThe analysis was done for silicon, but it\ncould be redone for other semiconductors by substituting their physical properties for those of silicon.\nThis work was done by John A.\nZoutendyk of Galtech for NASA\'s Jet\nPropulsion Laboratory.

After firing, the mixture provides a low-strength machinable\nmaterial having low thermal conductivity, high\xc2\xb7temperature resistance, and low\nthermal expansion. The first step in densifying the machined silica tile surfaces\nis to mask the tile so that only the surfaces to be treated are exposed. A\nmeasured amount of isopropyl alcohol Is\nbrushed on to aid in wettiQg the surfaces. The tile is immediately sub\xc2\xb7\nmerged in a silica slurry for 3 minutes.\nThe tile is removed from the slurry,\nand the residue remaining on the tile is\nbrushed into its exposed surfaces. Additional slurry is applied until it starts to\nbuild up on the surface. The excess is\ngently removed by wiping, and further\nslurry is added, with a total of three\nbrushing and wiping operations. A final\nbrushing operation works the fusedsilica aggregate into the surface so that\nit fills the voids sufficiently to provide a\nhard surface when the material has\ndried.\nThe slurry mix contains approximately 55 percent by weight colloidal silica,\n45 percent by weight silica slip (irregularly-shaped particulate silica), and 0.12\npercent by weight boron silicide for color. The slurry mix is continuously rollmixed to keep the silica particles in suspension until they are applied to the tile.\nThe densification process increases\nthe thermal conductivity of the surface\nlayer but does not seriously affect the\neffective overall thermal conductivity.\nFor a tile 2 inches (5.1 cm) thick, the\noverall conductivity is increased by\nabout 4 percent.\nThis work was done by Jack W.

CAPSTAR is augmented by an\nautomatic routing program , a display\nprogram , and a library of logic cells.\nInput to CAPSTAR consists of a\ndescription of circuit cells and\ninterconnections. This circuit description is used to form a near-optimum, onedimensional placement of the cells,\nwhich is then " folded " onto STAR to\nform a two-dimensional layout. By the\nuse of various folding strategies, a\nnumber of different layouts are formed .\n\n224\n\nThe best of these are selected and are\nimproved by a single interchange\ntechnique. The best improved layout is\ndetermined, and pads are added to\ngenerate the final layout. The\nplacements generated are nearoptimum with respect to horizontal and\nvertical channel usage and the number\nof nets that can be linearly routed .\nSTAR includes two programs developed to provide for the simulation of\nlogic circuits and for the generation of\ntest sequences for logic circuits .\nSIMLOG is a gate\xc2\xb7level , logic-simulation\nprogram that is based on a three-valued\nlogic model and on a unit-delay timing\nmodel. Both combinational and\nsequential circuits can be handled.\nLogic elements available for use include\nNAND gates, NOR gates, unit-delay\nelements, and edge-triggered D flipflops . The simulated circuit may also\ncontain single or multiple stUCk-type\nfaults. TESTGN is a test-sequence\ngeneration program for use with circuits\nbeing simulated by SIMLOG. The\nprogram can generate tests for\nunspecified faults or for specified single\nstuck-type faults .\nThe programs in STAR are written in\nBASIC and FORTRAN IV for batch\nexecution and have been implemented\non a Xerox Sigma V, with the largest\nprogram having a central memory\nrequirement of approximately 128K of\n32-bit words . The programs were\ndeveloped in 1979.\nThis program was written by G. W.\nCox and B. O. Carroll of Auburn University and E. R. Pitts and R. A. Wright of\nM & S Computing for Marshall Space\nFlight Center.

TFPM is fairly\nspecific to the orbiter, but the basic\ntechnique might be applied in other\nstructural design situations where the\nanticipated loads and material strength\nhave significantly variable probability\ndistributions.\nThe model generates probability distributions of the tensile loads acting on a\ngiven tile during a mission and combines\nthese with tile material-strength probability distributions to compute the probability of a tile tensile failure during the\nmission. This probability approach to\nfailure analysis is required because the\nstrength of the system, which consists of\nthe ceramic tile material, strain isolator\npad, and room-temperature-vulcanizing\nbond, exhibits wide variation even for\nsimilar sets of material.\nThe TFPM is written in FORTRAN IV\nand Assembler for batch execution and\nhas been implemented on an IBM\n370-series computer with a central\nmemory requirement of approximately\n800K of 8-bit bytes. The program was\ndeveloped in 1980.\nThis program was written by Eugene\nA. O \'Hern and Kenneth E. Ryan of\nRockwell International Corp. for John\xc2\xb7\nson Space Center.

The manual maintenance of\ndocumentation also increases the probability of documentation error, which\ncan decrease document reliability. The\nDocument Update and Compare programs provide a simple computerized\ndocument-maintenance system on the\nData General NOVA 840 computer.\nThe Document Update program\nallows the user to update a document\neither by batch or terminal input. It provides for automatic page sequencing,\nautomatic paragraph numbering and\nrenumbering (up to three levels) for insertions and deletions, automatic carry\nforward of station designator, and\nselectable headers and formatting. The\nupdated document may be output on a\nline printer with off-page (outside the\nstandard 8-1/2 by 11 area) printing of line\nnumbers for reference and future\nediting purposes.\nThe Compare program compares two\nversions of a document. It prints a\nlisting, by line number, of all insertions,\ndeletions, and changes.\nThese programs are written in FORTRAN V for batch or interactive execution and have been implemented on a\nData General NOVA 840 computer\nunder RDOS with a central memory requirement of approximately 32K words.\nThe programs were developed in 1981 .\nThis program was written by Charles\nF. Knoch, Dolores C. Caldwell, and\nDavid L. Caldwell of Rockwell International Corp. for Johnson Space Center.\nFor further information, Circle R on\nthe COSMIC Request Card.\nMSC-20349\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1982\n\nText File Comparator\n\nProgram compares two\nfil es and lists their\ndifferences.\nThe File Comparator program, IFCOMPo is a text file comparator for IBM\nOSNS-compatible systems. IFCOMP accepts as input two text files and produces a listing of their differences in\npseudo-update form. All differences are\nreported as lines that should be deleted,\nreplaced, inserted, or moved in the first\ninput file to transform It into the second\ninput file. A summary, listing the number\nof lines involved in each type of change,\nis also produced.\nIFCOMP has provisions to ignore line\nnumbers and trailing blanks when comparing files with records of different\nlengths. IFCOMP should be very useful\nin monitoring changes made to software\nat the source code level. When used in\nthis manner, IFCOMP allows for the\ndirect comparison of source code to\nidentify changes in a consistent manner.\nIFCOMP is written in XPL (an extended PLI language for which the compiler executables are supplied) for batch\nexecution and has been implemented on\nan IBM 370-series computer with a central memory requirement of approximately 46K of 8-bit bytes. IFCOMP was\ndeveloped in 1979.\nThis program was written by Reed S.\nKotler of Intermetrics, Inc. for Johnson\nSpace Center.

Configuration\n\nmanagement is a discipline composed\nof many techniques selected to track\nand direct the evolution of complex systems. CAT is an interactive program that\naccepts, organizes, and stores information pertinent to specific phases of a\nproject. In particular, CAT works with information concerning the design, development, testing, and maintenance of\nproject software. During a CAT interactive data input session, the user is\nprompted for information and is provided with informative and diagnostic\nmessages to ensure rapid and complete\ndata entry. Various project history\nreports are generated by CAT in response to user queries.\nAll data needed by CAT reside in a single project file. This is a direct-access\nfile in which a doubly-linked list structure\nis used for data organization.\nCAT operates in an EDIT mode and a\nREPORT mode. In the EDIT mode, authorized users can add, change, or\ndelete data. In the REPORT mode the\nuser can request CAT to generate proj\xc2\xb7\nect history reports from the data cur\xc2\xb7\nrently in the data base. Seven types of\nreports may be generated:\n1. The discrepancy history report, which\ncontains all reported errors and associated information for a project;\n2. The change history report, which con\xc2\xb7\ntains all reported modifications and\nenhancements to correct or to improve the project programs;\n3. The documentation history report,\nwhich contains all the information\nconcerning the disposition and status\nof documents generated within a\nproject;\n4. The test history report, which\ncontains information concerning what\nhas been tested and the test results;\n5. The resource history report, which\ncontains task member assignments;\n6. The milestone history report, which\nincludes current milestone infor\xc2\xb7\nmation; and\n7. The data set status history report,\nwhich contains the status and location of the project data sets and\nassociated information.\nWith these reports the configuration\nanalyst should be better able to track\nand direct the ongoing progress of complex software projects.\nCAT is written in FORTRAN IV Plus\nand Assembler for interactive execution\nand has been implemented on a DEC\nPDp\xc2\xb711/70 computer under RSX\xc2\xb711 M\n(continued on next page)\n227\n\nwith a central memory requirement of\napproximately 26K of 16-bit words. It\nwas developed in 1980.\nThis program was written by Phillip D.\nMerwarth of Goddard Space Flight\nCenter. For further information, Circle T on the COSMIC Request Card.\nGSC-12710\n\nSoftware Repository\n\nInteractive library system\naids in locating\navailable software.\nIn many large organizations, software\ndevelopment is duplicated from one\ngroup to another due to the lack of a formalized system for storing and making\navailable information on internally\navailable software. The Common Software Module Repository (CSMR) system\nprovides such a formalized system.\nCSMR is basically a computerized\nlibrary system with high product and service visibility to potential users. The\nonline capabilities of the system allow\nboth the librarian and the user to interact\nwith the library. The librarian is responSible for maintaining the information in the\nCSMR library. The user may search the\nlibrary to locate software modules that\nmight meet his or her current needs.\nAssociated with each library entry are\nfour files of data. The first three files contain the program abstract, the program\nprolog, and the program software\ncharacteristics. The fourth file contains\nthe program source code. The abstract\nis intended for use as a quick-look query\ninto the primary function of the library\nentry. In addition, the abstract contains\nan assigned library catalog number, the\ntitle of the software product, category information, the author, references, the\ndate the software was entered into the\nlibrary, the date of the last software update, the software support person, the\ntarget computer, and the source code\nlanguage.\nThe prolog is a more specific description of the module in such terms as\nmodule function , the method in which\nthe module accomplished its function ,\nmodule usage, and module interface requirements. The software characteristics include information concerning the\noperational efficiency of the software,\nsuch as storage and memory requirements, run-time estimates, and software\nmetrics. The CSMR system is designed\n\n228\n\nso that all of this information and the\nsoftware source code may be readly\nentered and maintained in the CSMR\nlibrary.\nThe CSMR system gives the user an\neasy method of searching the library for\nsoftware. The user interactively narrows\nthe number of library entries to be examined by responding to CSMRgenerated prompts. Once the selection\nof entries has been reduced to those\nthat satisfy specific requests, the user\nmay examine the abstract, prolog,\ncharacteristics, and source code of\neach. The users may then select one or\nmore entries for use in their software\nproject.\nThe CSMR system is written in\nFORTRAN IV-Plus and Assembler for interactive execution and has been implemented on a DEC PDP-11/70 computer under RSX-11 M with an overlaid\ncentral memory requirement of approximately 28K of 16-bit words. The CSMR\nsystem was developed in 1979.\nThis program was written by Phillip\nMerwarth of Goddard Space Flight\nCenter. For further information,\nCircle U on the COSMIC Request\nCard.\nGSC-12735\n\nResource Escalation and\nCost Analysis\n\nCost for proj ects with\nhierarchical elements is\ncalculated and spread over\ntime.\nThe Resource Escalation and Cost\nAnalysis Program (RECAP) is a cost\ncompilation program for any project organized in a work breakdown structure\n(WBS) format. In a WBS format, activities are broken down and organized\nby level, so that each activity at a high\nlevel includes those activities at a lower\nlevel. This permits the organization of\nactivities into classes and subclasses.\nRECAP can handle up to 1,000 WBS\nactivities and 4 levels with up to 99\nclasses of activities within a level.\nRECAP computes the cost of each activity directly, based on one of six cost\nequations, or indirectly as a function\nof the cost of some other activity or\nactivities.\nRECAP computes the costs of WBS\nitems and distributes those costs over a\nspan of up to 60 user-defined intervals.\n\nCosts for each activity may be spread\nover time according to a standard function with anyone of six spread algorithms. The distributed cost for each activity may be summed into a more\ngeneral activity to yield distributed cost\nfor each activity class.\nIn addition to escalating cost due to\nanticipated inflation, RECAP allows the\nuser to assign a fiscal base period to the\ninput costs. Costs may then be escalated for any inflation known or anticipated to have occurred between the\ntime that the project cost was initially\ncalculated and the period in which\nescalation is to begin.\nInput to RECAP consists of program\ndirective records and task records. The\nprogram directive records provide information required by the program and\nspecify the processing option to be exercised in a given run . The task records\nprovide information relevant to each\ntask, including information required for\ncost computation and distribution. Reports generated by RECAP include a\nsummary report, a summary report with\nescalated output, and line item reports.\nRECAP can also generate x-y plots of\nselected costs versus time.\nRECAP is written in FORTRAN IV for\nbatch execution and has been implemented on a CDC CYBER 170-series\ncomputer with an overlaid central memory requirement of approximately 78K\n(octal) of 60-bit words. The program was\ndeveloped in 1981 .\nThis program was written by Darrell\nA. Wood of Langley Research Center.\nFor further information, Circle V on\nthe COSMIC Request Card.\nLAR-13018\n\nDriver for DISSPLA\nPlotter\n\nA driver for plotter,\nmicrofilm, microfiche, and\nterminal graphics\nDISPLOT is a generalized outside\ndriver for the commercially-available\nDISSPLA (Display Integrated Software\nSystem and Plotting Language) plotting\nsystem. The DISPLOT program provides\nthe user with a simple-to-use graphics\ncapability with a great deal of application flexibility. DISPLOT is independent\nof whatever program generates the data\nto be plotted.\nDISPLOT may be used for the generation of plotter, microfilm, microfiche, and\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1982\n\nterminal plots. The user has complete\ncontrol of plot titling, axis labeling, and\ngeneral annotation. Plots using Cartesian, logarithmic, polar, and map projec\xc2\xb7\ntion scales are readily generated.\nDISPLOT also allows for the manipulation of the data to be plotted prior to plot\ngeneration.\nDISPLOT offers flexibility while utilizing simple input because of its design as\na DISSPLA driver with a data buffer.\nWith the data buffer, multiple variables\ncan be loaded at one time, which In\xc2\xb7\ncreases the speed of the program. The\nprogram also allows the user to\nmanipulate the input data before plotting\nthem. The user controls the flow of the\nDISPLOT program through economical\nNAMELIST inputs.\nDISPLOT is written in FORTRAN V\nand Assembler for batch execution and\nhas been implemented on a UNIVAC\n1100-series computer with a central\nmemory requirement of approximately\n93K of 36-bit words. DISPLOT was\ndeveloped in 1981.\nThis program was written by Mark L.\nBaldwin of McDonnell Douglas Corp. for\nJohnson Space Center. For further information, Circle W on the COSMIC\nRequest Card.\nMSC-20290\n\nInteractive Data\xc2\xb7\nCollection and Display\nProgram with Debugging\nIt aids deSigners when time\nand hardware constraints\nmake scaled-integer\narithmetic necessary.\nTo be cost-effective and to improve\nreliability, the number of parts in digital\nsystems designed for ruggedized applications is usually cut to a minimum.\nSuch reductions, along with requirements for increased computing speed,\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1982\n\ndemand assembly or machine language\ntechniques that use scaled-integer\narithmetic calculations. Implementing\nsuch techniques is difficult, and locating\nerrors within such assembly language\nprograms is extremely difficult, increasing the time and effort required to get the\nprograms up and running.\nThe INFORM program is designed to\naid the assembly language programers\nof SEL 810B computers in working with\nscaled-integer applications. INFORM\nwas developed to meet the needs of\nengineers designing real-time digital\ncontrols using the SEL 81 OB where time\nand hardware constraints make the use\nof integer arithmetic and scaled integers\nnecessary. In addition to producing dis\xc2\xb7\nplays of quasi-steady\xc2\xb7state values, INFORM provides an interactive mode for\ndebugging programs, for making program patches, and for modifying the\ndisplays. The package includes auxiliary\nroutines that add dynamic data acquisi\xc2\xb7\ntion and high\xc2\xb7speed dynamic display to\nthe INFORM capabilities.\nThe INFORM package is written in\nAssembler for interactive execution and\nhas been implemented on an SEL 810B\ncomputer with a central memory reo\nquirement of approximately 5K of 16-bit\nwords. The INFORM program was developed in 1980.\nThis program was written by David S.\nCwynar of Lewis Research Center. For\nfurther information, Circle X on the\nCOSMIC Request Card.\nLEW-13530\n\nNAMELIST Preprocessor\nFORTRAN code is modified\nfor use with the F4P\ncompiler.\nThe NAMELIST Preprocessor Program, NPP, provides the DEC PDP-11170\nwith capabilities identical to the IBM\nFORTRAN IV NAMELIST feature. The\n\npreprocessor modifies the FORTRAN\ncode that contains NAMELIST statements acceptable to the IBM FORTRAN\nIV compiler to generate an equivalent\ncode that is acceptable to the PDP-11\nFORTRAN IV-Plus (F4P) compiler.\nNAMELIST provides the FORTRAN\nprogramer with additional, flexible input\nand output capabilities. This feature is\nparticularly useful in the area of data input because NAMELIST data are input in\nthe form of the variable symbolic name\nbeing set equal to a constant value,\nsimilar to a standard FORTRAN statement. This allows the user to review input data readily and relieves the user\nfrom having to place data in certain columns and formats as required in formatted READ statements.\nNPP software consists of two parts:\nthe NAMELIST preprocessor and the\nNAMELIST library routines. The\npreprocessor modifies the FORTRAN\ncode containing NAMELIST statements\ninto a FORTRAN code acceptable to the\nPDP-11 F4P compiler. The NAMELIST\nlibrary routines, which must be included\nin tasks containing the NAMELIST\npreprocessor code, are the run-time\nroutines called by the inserted\npreprocessor code. The FORTRAN programer should find it easy and efficient\nto incorporate the NAMELIST feature\ninto many applications.\nThe NPP software system is written in\nFORTRAN IV-Plus and Assembler code\nfor batch exectuion and has been im\xc2\xb7\nplemented on a DEC PDP-11/70 under\nRSX-11 M with a central memory requirement of approximately 32K of 16-bit\nwords. The NPP software system was\ndeveloped in 1978.\nThis program was written by Phillip D.\nMerwarth of Goddard Space Flight\nCenter.
