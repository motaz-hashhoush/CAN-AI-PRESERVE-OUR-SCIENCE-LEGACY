The light bulb contains a chrome top that directs light to areas where it is needed most. The bulb, which lasts 2,000 hours, provides 40 percent more surface illumination on work and reading surfaces, compared to a standard incandescent bulb. The lightly frosted finish reduces glare, which helps to reduce eyestrain. The bulb is particularly helpful for people with low vision and eye diseases such as macular degeneration.", "title": "A Bright Idea for the Eyes", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-07T11:54:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-27T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20050031195, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20050031195, "id": "109f138d943947a68d84869a864c274f", "publicationName": "Spinoff", "publicationDate": "2004-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20050031195.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20050031195/downloads/20050031195.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20050031195/downloads/20050031195.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20050031195/downloads/20050031195.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
