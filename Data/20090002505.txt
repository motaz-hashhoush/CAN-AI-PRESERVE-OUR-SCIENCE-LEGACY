b'Virtual Reality System Offers a Wide Perspective\nOriginating Technology/NASA Contribution\n\nR\n\nobot Systems Technology Branch engineers\nat Johnson Space Center created the remotely\ncontrolled Robonaut for use as an additional\n\xe2\x80\x9cset of hands\xe2\x80\x9d in extravehicular activities (EVAs) and\nto allow exploration of environments that would be too\ndangerous or difficult for humans. One of the problems\nRobonaut developers encountered was that the robot\xe2\x80\x99s\ninterface offered an extremely limited field of vision.\nJohnson robotics engineer, Darby Magruder, explained\nthat the 40-degree field-of-view (FOV) in initial robotic\nprototypes provided very narrow tunnel vision, which\n\nposed difficulties for Robonaut operators trying to see the\nrobot\xe2\x80\x99s surroundings. Because of the narrow FOV, NASA\ndecided to reach out to the private sector for assistance.\nIn addition to a wider FOV, NASA also desired higher\nresolution in a head-mounted display (HMD) with the\nadded ability to capture and display video.\n\nPartnership\nFounded by former Johns Hopkins University optics\nresearcher, Dr. Lawrence Brown, Sensics Inc., received\na NASA Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)\nprogram award in 2003, and began Phase I of their FOV\ninterface for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Robonaut, which also included\n\ndevelopment of a wide FOV camera. Baltimore-based\nSensics created an HMD with a wide FOV, using a\npatented optical design to combine several tiled images\ninto a high-resolution, three-dimensional panorama.\nA follow-on Phase II SBIR project culminated with\nSensics delivering the piSight HMD to Johnson Space\nCenter in February 2008, after delivering the prototype\nthe year before.\nThe Sensics piSight HMD, essentially a high-tech viewfinder, offers an additional panoramic, high-resolution\ncamera array that allows remote control and telepresence,\nimmersing the HMD operator in the robot\xe2\x80\x99s workspace\nin real time. The operator sees through Robonaut\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ceyes\xe2\x80\x9d\nand controls its movements, working safely from a distance. \xe2\x80\x9cAstronauts wearing a piSight will feel just like they\nare experiencing the world from Robonaut\xe2\x80\x99s perspective,\ndue to the full field-of-view, which is an exciting advance\nfor the NASA robotics program,\xe2\x80\x9d says Brown.\n\nProduct Outcome\n\nAn operator in the background wears a head-mounted display that allows him to see through the Robonaut\xe2\x80\x99s eyes\n(cameras)\xe2\x80\xafwith a wide near-human field-of-view.\n\n134\t Computer Technology \t\n\nWith the piSight, virtual surroundings appear in the\nviewfinder and respond to head movements. By coordinating head and joystick movements, the user flies or\ncoasts up, down, forward, or sideways. Some versions of\nthe piSight work with motion trackers, which eliminate\nthe need for a joystick and, instead, follow the user\xe2\x80\x99s\nmovement realistically.\nWhen used with the piSight, InterSense Inc.\xe2\x80\x99s\nSoniWing tracks user movements, employing technology\nsimilar to some video gaming systems. With the addition\nof the SoniWing, the user\xe2\x80\x99s entire body moves within\nthe virtual environment, allowing greater freedom than\nsystems restricted to head motion, and the environment\nresponds realistically to the user\xe2\x80\x99s location and movements. Sensics also offers customized systems that track\na user\xe2\x80\x99s eye movements, which help vision researchers\nlearn which images or objects in a scene hold a user\xe2\x80\x99s\ninterest, and also offers a video see-through solution for\nSpinoff 2008\n\nThe\xe2\x80\xaflightweight piSight head-mounted\xe2\x80\xafdisplay offers a wide\nfield-of-view with multiple screens per eye to allow for\xe2\x80\xafmore\nrealistic visual experiences.\n\napplications in which users need to see the virtual world\nand reality simultaneously.\nThe piSight HMD is light (weighing less than\n2 pounds), stable, comfortable, and adjustable to an individual\xe2\x80\x99s head and eye shape, but Sensics still wants to make\nthe technology more lightweight and efficient. Currently,\npiSight can be used with a variety of virtual reality software and platforms, including OpenSceneGraph on\nLinux and WorldViz products on Windows.\nThe piSight also offers high resolution \xe2\x80\x9cbetter than an\nHDTV display,\xe2\x80\x9d according to Brown, with the NASA\nmodel displaying 12 screens per eye; lower-end models\nhave as few as 3 screens per eye. Other commercially\navailable HMDs usually offer fewer screens, fewer\ncameras, or poorer resolution, which leads to either a\nmuch smaller field of vision (i.e., no peripheral vision) or\na poor-quality image that appears pixilated or stretched.\nWith more screens per eye, however, each display can\nSpinoff 2008\t\n\noffer a slightly different orientation, forming a concave\narrangement that wraps around the eye, and projecting\na different and more realistic perspective. In a higherend model, the user can see in high resolution for 150\ndegrees, which is almost as wide as the natural range for\nhumans. \xe2\x80\x9cThe operator basically sees a field-of-view that\nhas virtually no limitations,\xe2\x80\x9d Brown notes.\nThe piSight camera array captures panoramic, highresolution live video, which a user views while wearing the\npiSight HMD. Video is compressed, sent over a network,\nand then displayed inside the HMD. This interface may\nbe able to support astronauts and engineers on Earth with\nvarious tasks like repairs and maintenance in high-risk\nenvironments. An astronaut in orbit, for example, could\nuse the piSight remotely to control a robot on the surface\nof the Moon and examine the surrounding environment\nin real time. The system could also enhance safety on\nEarth by enabling remote operation of machinery in\nbiohazard, defense, or medical environments, without\nrequiring physical access to the site. In an emergency\ninvolving hazardous materials, a human operator could\nuse the piSight system to remedy the situation from a\nsafe location.\nSensics is finding success in the commercial sector, with\nsales of its products topping $1 million in 2007. Sensics\nis currently marketing the piSight to larger companies,\nsince system prices start at about $27,500. Depending\non customization and features, such as additional camera\narrays for a wider field-of-vision, the units can cost up\nto $100,000.\nCommercial applications for the piSight are only\nlimited by customers\xe2\x80\x99 imaginations. \xe2\x80\x9cCustomers have been\nselecting the piSight systems for a variety of simulation,\ntraining, design, and research applications,\xe2\x80\x9d says Brown.\nAn automobile designer uses the HMD to \xe2\x80\x9csit\xe2\x80\x9d in the\ndriver\xe2\x80\x99s seat of an automobile and explore the design\nin a realistic, immersive experience before production\nbegins. Other companies are beginning to use the piSight\nfor training purposes that involve learning specific\n\nThe piSight\xe2\x80\xafcan be used with Linux or Windows virtual reality\nsoftware, and can be controlled via motion trackers\nor joysticks.\n\ntasks in situations, such as teaching a quarterback a\nspecific play or showing a soldier how to operate a certain\npiece of equipment. Clearly, NASA will not be alone\nin reaping the benefits from virtual reality systems like\nthe piSight. v\npiSight\xe2\x84\xa2 is a trademark of Sensics Inc.\nSoniWing\xe2\x84\xa2 is a trademark of InterSense Inc.\nLinux\xc2\xae is a registered trademark of Linus Torvalds.\nWindows\xc2\xae is a registered trademark of Microsoft Corporation.\n\nComputer Technology \t 135\n\n'
