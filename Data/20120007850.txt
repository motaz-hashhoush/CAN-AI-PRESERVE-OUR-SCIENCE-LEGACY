b"Space: The Asteroid Frontier\nFebruary 9,2012\nDr. Lucy McFadden\nScientist and Chief for Higher Education\nNASA Goddard Space Flight Center\nGreenbelt, MD 20771\n\nAbstract:\nThere are many ways of studying the Asteroid Frontier as a scientist. In my career, I\nhave used large telescopes atop a 14,000 ft mountain top observatory in Hawaii,\nused the Hubble Space Telescope in orbit around the Earth, traveled to Antarctica to\ncollect meteorites sitting on the ice waiting for them to be recovered by scientists\nfor scientific investigation, walked the desert with 50 students from University of\nKhartoum searching for fragments of an asteroid that collided with earth, exploded\nin the upper atmosphere and rained fragments on the desert floor. Most recently, I\nhave looked at one of the largest Main Belt Asteroids named (4) Vesta through the\neyes of a robotic spacecraft named Dawn, exploring the asteroid frontier. I will\nshare my adventures, place the thrill of scientific exploration through NASA's solar\nsystem exploration program in context and provide opportunities for students to\nengage in NASA's exciting missions to expand scientific understanding of Earth and\nthe Universe in which we live.\n\n"
