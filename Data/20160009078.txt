b'SUMMARY\nThe ISS Payload Human Factors\nImplementation Team (HFIT) is the\nPayload Developer\xe2\x80\x99s resource for\nHuman Factors.\n\xef\x82\xb7 HFIT is the interface between\nPayload Developers and ISS\nPayload Human Factors\nrequirements in SSP 57000.\n\xef\x82\xb7 HFIT provides\nrecommendations on how to\nmeet the Human Factors\nrequirements and guidelines\nearly in the design process.\n\xef\x82\xb7 HFIT coordinates with the\nPayload Developer and\nAstronaut Office to find low cost\nsolutions to Human Factors\nchallenges for hardware\noperability issues.\n\nCONTACT US\nRichard Ellenberger\nISS Payload Human Factors\nManager\nJohnson Space Center\ns.r.ellenberger@nasa.gov\n(281) 483-5238\n\nJohnson Space Center\nHouston, Texas 77058\n\nISS Payload\nHuman Factors\n\nLaura Duvall\nISS Flight Crew Integration\nSystem Manager\nJohnson Space Center\nlaura.e.duvall@nasa.gov\n(281) 483-0244\nJonathan Dory\nChief, Habitability and Human\nFactors Branch\nJohnson Space Center\njonathan.r.dory@nasa.gov\n(281) 483-1162\n\nVisit Johnson Space Center\nHuman Health & Performance online:\nAstronaut Office Rep exercising crew interfaces\nas part of an HFIT evaluation\n\nNational Aeronautics and\nSpace Administration\n\nwww.nasa.gov/hhp\n\nHuman Factors\nImplementation Team\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nHFIT Process \xe2\x80\x93 How It Works\n\nHuman Factors Implementation\nTeam (HFIT) provides Human\nFactors support for ISS Payloads to\nmeet Human Factors requirements\nand help them be successful onorbit. The team is comprised of\nHuman Factors and Astronaut\nOffice representatives.\n\n\xef\x82\xb7 HFIT rep assigned at Payload\nKickoff\n\xef\x82\xb7 HFIT initial evaluation at or soon\nafter Preliminary Design Review\n(PDR), or early in development\no\n\nAssess prototype hardware for crew\ninterfaces and labeling against\nHuman Factors requirements and\nguidelines in SSP 57000.\n\no\n\no\n\nRecommendations for compliance\nare documented.\n\n\xef\x82\xa7 HFIT evaluates all aspects of\nhardware crew interfaces, such as\naccessibility and strength to perform\ntasks, clearance between\ncontrols/connectors, labeling, etc.\n\n\xef\x82\xa7 HFIT provides human factors\ndesign recommendations for\nhardware early in the design\nprocess when it is cost effective to\ninfluence the design.\n\n\xef\x82\xb7 Between evaluations: HFIT\nprovides requirements and\nguidelines support as needed.\no\n\nNegotiates solutions to\nrequirements-design conflicts.\n\n\xef\x82\xb7 HFIT final evaluation after\nCritical Design Review (CDR),\nor when flight hardware is ready\no\n\no\n\nVerify flight hardware against\nHuman Factors and labeling\nrequirements in SSP 57000.\n\nFront Panel labeling\n\nHFIT/Astronaut Office approve\npre-coordinated, non-safety\nrelated non-compliances (out-ofboard).\n\no HFIT provides Certification of\nHFIT Rep checking for Burrs\n\nPayload fire port labeling\n\nIssues are identified early when it is\nmore cost effective to influence\ndesign.\n\n\xef\x82\xa7 HFIT verifies that hardware meets\nSpace Station Program (SSP)\n57000 Section 3.12 Human Factors\nRequirements and the labeling\ninstructions Appendix O.\n\nLabeling Examples\n\nCompliance (CoC) after all issues\nclosed.\n\nCable labeling\n\n'
