b'24. CRAWLER TRANSPORTER\n\nSTEERING AND JEL SYSTEMS\nBy Virgil Leon Davis\nJohn F. Kennedy Space Center\n\nSUMMARY\nA vital element to Launch Complex 39 and the Kennedy Space Center (KSC)\nmobile transfer operation is a culmination of many unique engineering mechanisms known as the Crawler Transporter . The Transporter is a mighty tortoise\nweighing 2.8 million kilograms (6.3 million pounds) used to lift a S.7-million\n-kilogram (12.6-million-pound) combination of Mobile Launcher and space vehicle,\ntransfer this load approximately 5.6 kilometers (3.5 miles) from its point of\nassembly, negotiate curves of l52-meter (500-foot) mean radius, climb a\n5-percent grade while maintaining the 122-meter (400-foot) structure in a vertical position within 10 minutes of are, and smoothly position this huge structure\nto within +5.1 centimeters (+ 2 inches) on support pedestals at the launch\npad.\nINTRODUCTION\nThere are some unique mechanisms in the hydraulic jacking, equalization,\nleveling (JEL), and steering systems required by the Crawler to perform its\nmission. Numerous problems associated with these mechanisms have been overcome in a program requiring fabrication of operational equipment while proceeding with a developmental process. This was necessary since complete data did\nnot exist in some phases of the design prior to construction. Besides, such\nan independent transporter system had never been built, and today only two such\nsystems are in existence.\nPRELIMINARY DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS\nThe primary impetus behind the selection of the Crawler Transporter as the\nprime mover during the development of facilities for the Saturn V space vehicle in 1962 was the fabrication of a similar device--a 76.2-meter (250-foot)\nhigh, 8.16-million-kilogram (18-million-pound) stripping shovel. Crawler excavators were tried and proven methods of handling large loads, some similar in\nmagnitude to those required for the Apollo-Saturn V Program. After studying\nvarious transfer modes in detail, it was concluded that a crawler-mounted transporter would be the most advantageous method of turning the mobile concept into\nworkable hardware.\nThe feasibility study of the crawler transfer concept basically proposed a\ncrawler-mounted transporter and launcher pad in one unit. It was suggested\nthat after the transporter and launcher pad were placed on fixed mounts, the\nleveling cylinder pistons could be raised, the steering cylinders and struts\ncould be removed, and the trucks. could be walked out under power. Such an undertaking involved problems associated with heavy equipment movement, as well\n\n359\n\nas problems in repositioning the crawlers under the transporter platform.\nEarly in the analysis it became evident that there were considerable advantages\nto removing the crawlers from the launch platform and providing an independent\ncrawler transporter structure.\nThis arrangement (see Figure 1) allowed the trucks, together with se1fcontained power-generating, hydraulic-leveling, and steering equipment mounted\nin a transporter structure, to act as an independent unit that could easily be\nremoved from the blast area during launch. An independent crawler transporter\ncould also be favorably positioned under the center of gravity of the Mobile\nLauncher platform to enable more even load distribution on the crawler trucks.\nAdditionally, fewer transporter units were needed since one could be on the\nmove to another area while its deposited load was undergoing testing or checkout.\nTo enable the Crawler Transporter to function in its unique role at\nKennedy Space Center, there were many changes required to evolve from \'a stripping shovel prime mover concept to an independent transporter mode. Large\nstripping shovels were constructed on site in an excavated hole; they removed\nthe overburden (earth) in front of them and moved over terrain smoothened by\nbulldozers. Behind them were power cables plugged into extended substations.\nIf a support cylinder leaked, the hydraulic fluid was collected (in a saucer\nsurrounding the cylinder) and pumped back into its own reservoir. If a shoe\nbroke or some similar problem occurred, the shovels kept going until they were\nforced into a repair mode. This operational philosophy was not amenable to\nreliable fulfillment of strict launch schedules. Besides, the leveling capability of stripping shovels was designed primarily to prevent the machine from\nturning over and was not adaptable for the critical tolerance level required\nto transport a 36-story rocket while its topmost part remains within +5 minutes\nof arc, or within the dimensions of a basketball. It was essential tomaintain the transported load in a level plane and to reduce acceleration, torque,\nand jarring forces to a minimum. Reliability of the hydraulic system and operational integrity of the equipment were absolute requirements and major\ndesign challenges. With these considerations in mind, KSC adopted the transporter configuration depicted in Figure 2. If a critical control component\nshould fail, there would be a backup system immediately available. In the\nevent of a serious malfunction, such as a hydraulic line rupture, the load\nwould be kept from becoming unbalanced by automatically locking (or securing)\nthe corner cylinders. These cylinders, in groups of four, were designed s~ch\nthat if one should fail, the 5.7-mi11ion-ki10gram (12.6-mi11ion-pound) load\ncould still be safely transported.\nA contract for two transporters was awarded in March 1963. The procurement\nplan called for assembly of the first Crawler Transporter by late 1964, followed\nby operational testing with resultant changes or modifications to be complete\nby March 1965. Both Transporters became operational early in 1966. (Their\nfinal configuration is shown in Figure 3.)\nLet us briefly look at a few of those unique mechanisms and discuss the\ndesign evolution in relationship to stripping shovels used in the early 1960\xc2\xb7s\nas well as problems that were associated with the fabrication/development process.\n360\n\nJEL SUSPENSION SYSTEM\nPreviously, chassis support of large crawler excavators was dependent\nupon the utilization of a single, 1arge diameter, hydraulic cylinder (see Figure\n1). In order to preclude damage to transported loads in the event of a single\ncylinder failure, a clustering of cylinders was designed for the transporter\nsuspension system. A single cylinder would not only have to provide proper\nleveling, but it would have to resist side loads introduced by wind as well as\npropel and steering conditions. Horizontal forces acting on a fixed vertical\ncylinder produce bending, and, if forces are of significant magnitude, they\nwill cause hydraulic oil leakage, galling, and possible failure.\nTo prevent introducing shearing forces into the hydraulic actuators, a\nunique arrangement was designed for the four double-track truck suspension\nsystem. In the center of each truck is a 1.22-meter (4-foot) diameter guide\ntube that slides in a spherical bearing (see Figure 4). Clustered around this\nguide tube are four linear single-acting hydraulic cylinders with a 508-millimeter (20-inch) bore and an extensible stroke of 2006 millimeters (79 inches).\nThe cylinder assembly on which the weight of the transported load rests is\n\'designed to operate at a normal pressure of 20.7 million newtons/meter2\n(3000 psig), an emergency pressure of 33.1 million newtons/meter 2 (4800 psig),\nand to withstand 41.2 million newtons/meter 2 (6000 psig) proof pressure and\n62.3 million newtons/meter 2 (9000 psig) burst pressure. The support cylinders\nare attached to the chassis and trucks with spherical ball bushings to assure\nthat only vertical loads are transmitted.\nShear forces from propel, steering, or wind loads are transmitted through\nthe guide tube and into the chassis through a spherical bearing housed on the\ntrucks. This not only removes horizontal loads from the cylinders but provides\na pivot for the truck and permits vertical movement of the chassis in relation\nto the crawler truck . . The guide tube fits into the cylindrical inside surface\nof a bronze ball bushing (see Figure 5) . The outside surface of the bushing\nis a spherical section that mates with the inside surface of a concentric\nbushing container. This assembly enables limited tilt of the trucks in any\ncombination of lateral or longitudinal motion. Changes in the vertical position of the chassis and rotational positions of the crawlers are supplied to the\nsteering and JEL servo systems by transducers mounted at the bottom of the\nguide tube assembly.\nThe extremely low vertical friction allowed by this mechanism has provided\nfor smooth leveling and jacking operations. This unique grouping has resisted\nlarge wind loads, having carried a Saturn V test vehicle on board a mobile\nlauncher 5.63 kilometers (3.5 miles) at 0.04 meter/second (1 mile/hour) in\nwinds as high as 30.1 meters/second (68 miles/hour) without incident. After\nmore than eight years of operation, there has been no hydraulic leakage from\nthese cylinders, and none have even had to be removed or partially disassembled.\nSTEERING THE TRANSPORTERS\nPositioning the Mobile Launcher on its support pedestals requires precise maneuverability since alignment must be within +50.8 millimeters (+2\n361\n\nJ\n\ninches ) . Not only is this no easy task, but special considerations had to be\ntaken j us t to enable the negotiation of a l52-meter (500-foot) radius curve.\nSince t he crawler trucks are located on 27.4-meter (gO-foot) centers, there\nis an angu l ar position error between the inside and outside crawler trucks\nduring grea t circle steering. Experience with large shovels propelling over\nsurfaces other than coal, upon which they are usually operated, revealed that\nlarge hori zontal loads were applied to their trucks. This lead to a reevaluati on\nof the preli minary concept (depicted in Figure 1) of using a single-acting\ncylinder to pivot each truck about its center. The front and rear end trucks\nwere connected by a large tie rod that pulled one truck while the opposite\ntruck was be ing pushed by one single-acting steering cylinder. Since an in dependent transporter chassis would be much less rigid than that required for\na permanent ly attached platform, scuffing loads introduced in skidding a crawl er\ntruck t hro ugh a one-degree steering error could introduce stress levels high\nenough to cau se severe chassis distortion. A mechanical linkage could have\nbeen des i gned to give the desired correction, but due to maintenance, cost, and\nweight cons i de rations, it was decided to provide an Ackermann correction in\nthe electronic servo system. Independent push-pull action was incorporated\ninto each corner by using large double-acting hydraulic cylinders. For redundancy, t hes e cylinders were mounted in pairs at each end of a crawler truck .\nThese t wo m\nechanisms (electronic Ackermann correction and double-acting cylinders) al l ow the four trucks to be steered independently around corners in\na great circ le mode as well as diagonally in a crab mode.\nThe poss ible consequences of stresses introduced by the truck/road contact\nsurface (46 .5 meters L) (500 feet 2) were areas of major concern and consequentl y\nwere tho roughly investigated and analyzed. The chassis structure was designed\nto resist scuffing loads of 2.3-million kilograms (500,000-pounds) over those\nexpected. A scale (1/8) model of the Crawler Transporter chassis was constru cted\nto determi ne and analyze projected loads. A scale (3/8) model of the steering\narm assembl y (see Figure 4) was assembled and tested. A scale (3/8) model of\nthe Crawler shoes was tested to destruction. Results of the model analyses were\nused to formulate design modifications to improve the load carrying capability\nof these structures. Since stresses are at a maximum during steering (sliding\nthe trucks across the rOqd surface), many tests were performed in an effort t o\ndetermine a suitable, low friction, resilient roadbed. Model tests were not\neasy to simulate; therefore, verification was accomplished after constructi on.\nTests on a prepared surface, sand, macadam, crushed granite, and river rock\nled to the selection of river rock as the minimum frictional surface for ut ilization on the Crawlerway.\nOper ational experience with the transporter disclosed that, even with a\nreduced f rictional surface, large pressures were exerted in the hydraulic\nsteeri ng sys tem. Since both corner cylinders were needed for proper steering,\nthe requi red redundancy was marginal at best under full load. The loss of a\ncylinder under these conditions could possibly result in a launch scrub. In\norder to adequately provide redundancy and to increase the capabilities of the\n\n362\n\nSYS4em , two steering cylinders were added to each truck. The new cylinders work\n\nperpendicular to and are identical to the original ones. They are used in\npairs extending from steering brackets mounted below the Crawler Transporter\nchassis to an auxiliary steering arm (see Figure 4) welded to the inside frame\nof each truck.\n\nThe uprated steering system was not implemented until 1969. Before proceeding with the modification, a sound engineering basis was developed through\na detailed control servo system analysis, through mathematical stress analysis,\nand throug h a model evaluation program. The scale (1/8) model originally used\nfor chassi s design verification was modified and used to evaluate structural\nresponse to loads introduced by the uprated steering system. An analysis\nshowed that the proposed hydraulically activated electro-mechanical steering\nnetwork was inherently stable; testing and operations have verified this many\ntimes.\nIn addition to structural changes, the modification included 16 four-way twoposition pilot-operated valves. In the disabled condition, these isolate se1ected cyl i nders from the hydrau 1i c pumps. They also a 11 ow the doub 1e-acti.ng cyli nder to "fl oatil by permitti ng trapped hydraul i c fl ui d to flow -back and forth\nfrom a compressed chamber into an expanded chamber. The system now has the capability of operating with one or both pump sets and with two, three, or four operating steering cylinders per corner--thus providing complete redundancy with only\na small sacrifice in steering rate.\nJEL SYSTEM STABILITY\nConventional leveling of large stripping shovels was accomplished by adjusting the relative height of diagonally opposite corners by sensing the height\nvariation with crude mercury-level switches or by using large heavy pendulums to\nsense level changes. These mechanisms were centrally located and mounted on\nrigid structures. They were not considered feasible for use on an independent,\nflexible structure due to tighter level requirements and possible chassis deflection. A manometer-type leveling system extending across diagonal corners was proposed, and a 39.6-meter (130-foot) full-scale experimental mockup was made to\ndetermine the dynamic characteristics of acceleration forces inherent in such a\nsystem. Theoretical analyses confirmed by test results demonstrated that a closed\nmanometer system equipped with differential pressure transducers was a feasible\nlevel sensor for Crawler Transporter applications.\nAlthough diagonal axes may be level, they may also lie in separate planes.\nDesign specifications required that no support point be more than 50.8 millimeters (2 inches) out of plane. Large shovels, when propelling, would connect\ntwo adjace nt corners together so that the loads would be equal on one end. An\noff-centered load with such a three-point equalization system could set up large\ntwisting or warping moments in the chassis. Therefore, it was proposed to use a\nhydraulic-equalizing system, causing the sum of corner loads on one diagonal to be\nequal to the corner load sum of the other diagonal.\n\n363\n\nL\n\nJ\n\nInitial test runs during 1965 resulted in over-reaction and instability in\nthe "\nhydraulic servo system. A stability study and computer analysis revealed\nthat the original pressure loop criteria had not taken into account (1) varying\noil compressibility constants caused by cylinder extension nor (2) differences\nin the spring constant incurred by mass changes between loaded and unloaded\nconfigurations.\nThe problem was corrected by augmenting two additional manometers across\nthe front and rear corners perpendicular to the travel direction. Unloaded\nmoves are performed using only the manometer system for leveling and equalization control. During loaded moves, hydraulic-pressure transducers located\nat each corner are used to control platform equalization. With the Mobile\nLauncher on board, the manometer equalization system provides only out-of-limit\nwarnings and shutdowns . Leveling is accomplished at all times by the mercury\nmanometer mechanism.\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\nIn order to meet schedule requirements of a facility of such complexity\nand unprecedented size, it was necessary for ground equipment design to proceed\nin parallel with vehicular design. The evolution from concept to operational\nhardware of such unique equipment was not strictly based on a theoretical approach\nbut on reasonable criteria developed through actual experience with past design\nand a periodic update resulting from actual and model test results. The\nCrawler Transporter is an exemplification of this methodology. The end result\n(see Figure 6) speaks for itself. Theoretical evaluations were supplemented\nby model tests and these in turn by actual tests of the physical hardware-each stage of the development leading to an improved design.\nAlthough the Crawler Transporter was designed specifically for the Apollo\nProgram, it has supported the Skylab Program without modification, even though\nthe Mobile Launcher pedestal addition for the Skylab lB configuration caused\na weight increase. The adapatability of the independent Crawler Transporter\nis evident as it has supported various platform configurations for the Apollo\nand Skylab Programs as well as the giant steel Mobile Service Structure (see\nFigure 7). The Crawler Transporters will not require modification to\ntransport the Space Shuttle on its Mobile Launcher Platform (see Figure 8).\nOnce again, our Space Program\'s success will be highly dependent on a tried\nand proven "mighty tortoise"!\n\n364\n\n-\n\n---\n\n- - --\n\n-\n\n--- - - - -.- .-.\n\n- . --.\n\n--- ---\n\n.\n--\n\n9.JM\n\n?..\n\n=.
