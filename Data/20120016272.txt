b'leaking into the dome. Instead the affected stack gas stream pressure rises detectably, thereby enabling a system shutdown. All electrical and fluid\nconnections to the stack are made inside the pressure dome and require special plumbing and electrical dome interfaces for this to be accomplished.\nFurther benefits of the dome are that it\ncan act as a containment shield in the\nunlikely event of a catastrophic failure.\nStudies indicate that, for a given active\narea (and hence, cell ID), frame outside\ndiameter must become ever larger to support stresses at higher operating pressures. This can lead to a large footprint\nand increased costs associated with\nthicker and/or larger diameter endplates, tie-rods, and the frames themselves. One solution is to employ rings\nthat fit snugly around the frame. This\ncomplicates stack assembly and is sometimes difficult to achieve in practice, as its\nsuccess is strongly dependent on frame\n\nand ring tolerances, gas pressure, and operating temperature. A pressure dome\npermits an otherwise low-pressure stack\nto operate at higher pressures without\ngrowing the electrolyzer hardware.\nThe pressure dome consists of two\nmachined segments. An O-ring is\nplaced in an O-ring groove in the\nflange of the bottom segment and is\ntrapped by the flange on the top dome\nsegment when these components are\nbolted together with high-strength\nbolts. The pressure dome has several\nunique features. It is made (to ASME\nPressure Vessel guidelines) in a highstrength aluminum alloy with the\nstrength of stainless steel and the\nweight benefits of aluminum. The\nflange of the upper dome portion contains specially machined flats for\nmounting the dome, and other flats\ndedicated to the special feedthroughs\nfor electrical connections. A pressure\ndome can be increased in length to\n\nhouse larger stacks (more cells) of the\nsame diameter with the simple addition\nof a cylindrical segment.\nTo aid in dome assembly, two stainless\nsteel rings are employed. One is used beneath the heads of the high-strength\nbolts in lieu of individual hardened washers, and another is used instead of individual nuts. Like electrolyzers could be\noperated at low or high pressures simply\nby operating the electrolyzer outside or\ninside a pressurized dome.\nThis work was done by Timothy Norman\nand Edwin Schmitt of Giner Electrochemical\nSystems, LLC for Glenn Research Center.\nFurther information is contained in a TSP\n(see page 1).\nInquiries concerning rights for the commercial use of this invention should be addressed to NASA Glenn Research Center, Innovative Partnerships Office, Attn: Steven\nFedor, Mail Stop 4\xe2\x80\x938, 21000 Brookpark\nRoad, Cleveland, Ohio 44135.

Glenn Research Center, Cleveland, Ohio\nReplacing the mechanical check-valve\nin a Stirling engine with a micromachined, non-moving-part flow diode\neliminates moving parts and reduces the\nrisk of microparticle clogging.\nAt very small scales, helium gas has\nsufficient mass momentum that it can\nact as a flow controller in a similar way\nas a transistor can redirect electrical signals with a smaller bias signal. The innovation here forces helium gas to flow in\npredominantly one direction by offering a clear, straight-path microchannel\n\nin one direction of flow, but then\nthrough a sophisticated geometry, the\nreversed flow is forced through a tortuous path. This redirection is achieved by\nusing microfluid channel flow to force\nthe much larger main flow into this tortuous path.\nWhile microdiodes have been developed in the past, this innovation cascades Tesla diodes to create a much\nhigher pressure in the gas bearing supply plenum. In addition, the special\nshape of the leaves captures loose parti-\n\ncles that would otherwise clog the microchannel of the gas bearing pads.\nThis work was done by Rodger Dyson for\nGlenn Research Center. Further information is\ncontained in a TSP (see page 1).\nInquiries concerning rights for the commercial use of this invention should be addressed to NASA Glenn Research Center, Innovative Partnerships Office, Attn: Steven\nFedor, Mail Stop 4\xe2\x80\x938, 21000 Brookpark\nRoad, Cleveland, Ohio 44135.

There are many types of actuators that were designed to operate as linear or rotary motors, but there is still a\nneed for low-force, low-noise linear actu-\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, October 2012\n\nators for specialized applications, and the\ndisclosed mechanism addresses this\nneed.\nA simpler implementation of a rotary\nactuator was developed where the end effector controls the motion of a brush for\ncleaning a thermal sensor. The mechanism uses a SMA (shape-memory alloy)\nwire for low force, and low noise. The lin-\n\near implementation of the actuator incorporates a set of springs and mechanical\nhard-stops for resetting and fault tolerance to mechanical resistance. The actuator can be designed to work in a pull or\npush mode, or both. Depending on the\nvolume envelope criteria, the actuator\ncan be configured for scaling its volume\ndown to 4\xc3\x972\xc3\x971 cm3. The actuator design\n\n19\n\nActuator shaft\nFault tolerant and resetting\nactuator elements\n\nActive SMA element\n\nThe Actuator is driven by shape memory alloy as a primary active element. Electrical connections to\npoints A and B are used to apply electrical power in the resistive NiTi wire, causing a phase change\nthat contracts the wire on the order of 5%.\n\nhas an inherent fault tolerance to mechanical resistance. The actuator has the\nflexibility of being designed for both linear and rotary motion. A specific configuration was designed and analyzed where\nfault-tolerant features have been implemented. In this configuration, an externally applied force larger than the design\nforce does not damage the active components of the actuator. The actuator housing can be configured and produced\n\nusing cost-effective methods such as injection molding, or alternatively, its components can be mounted directly on a small\ncircuit board.\nThe actuator is driven by a SMA -NiTi\nas a primary active element, and it requires energy on the order of 20 Ws(J)\nper cycle. Electrical connections to\npoints A and B are used to apply electrical power in the resistive NiTi wire, causing a phase change that contracts the\n\nwire on the order of 5%. The actuation\nperiod is of the order of a second for\ngenerating the stroke, and 4 to 10 seconds for resetting. Thus, this design allows the actuator to work at a frequency\nof up to 0.1 Hz.\nThe actuator does not make use of the\nwhole range of motion of the SMA material, allowing for large margins on the\nmechanical parameters of the design.\nThe efficiency of the actuator is of the\norder of 10%, including the margins.\nThe average dissipated power while driving at full speed is of the order of 1 W,\nand can be scaled down linearly if the\nrate of cycling is reduced. This design\nproduces an extremely quiet actuator; it\ncan generate a force greater than 2 N\nand a stroke greater than 1 cm. The operational duration of SMA materials is of\nthe order of millions of cycles with some\nreduced stroke over a wide temperature\nrange up to 150 \xc2\xbaC.\nThis work was done by Mircea Badescu,\nStewart Sherrit, and Yoseph Bar-Cohen of Caltech for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\nFurther information is contained in a TSP\n(see page 1). NPO-47991\n\nUltra-Compact Motor Controller\nApplications include industrial robotic arms, industrial machinery, and automobiles.\nLyndon B. Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nThis invention is an electronically\ncommutated brushless motor controller\nthat incorporates Hall-array sensing in a\nsmall, 42-gram package that provides\n4096 absolute counts per motor revolution position sensing. The unit is the\nsize of a miniature hockey puck, and is a\n44-pin male connector that provides\nmany I/O channels, including CANbus,\nRS-232 communications, general-purpose analog and digital I/O (GPIO),\nanalog and digital Hall inputs, DC\npower input (18\xe2\x80\x9390 VDC, 0\xe2\x80\x93l0 A),\nthree-phase motor outputs, and a strain\ngauge amplifier.\nThis controller replaces air cooling\nwith conduction cooling via a high-thermal-conductivity epoxy casting. A secondary advantage of the relatively good\nheat conductivity that comes with ultrasmall size is that temperature differences\nwithin the controller become smaller, so\nthat it is easier to measure the hottest\ntemperature in the controller with fewer\ntemperature sensors, or even one temperature sensor.\n\n20\n\nAnother size-sensitive design feature\nis in the approach to electrical noise\nimmunity. At a very small size, where\nconduction paths are much shorter\nthan in conventional designs, the\nground becomes essentially isopotential, and so certain (space-consuming)\nelectrical noise control components\nbecome unnecessary, which helps\nmake small size possible. One windingcurrent sensor, applied to all of the\nwindings in fast sequence, is smaller\nand wastes less power than the two or\nmore sensors conventionally used to\nsense and control winding currents. An\nunexpected benefit of using only one\ncurrent sensor is that it actually improves the precision of current control\nby using the \xe2\x80\x9csame\xe2\x80\x9d sensors to read\neach of the three phases. Folding the\nencoder directly into the controller\nelectronics eliminates a great deal of\nredundant electronics, packaging, connectors, and hook-up wiring. The reduction of wires and connectors subtracts substantial bulk and eliminates\n\ntheir role in behaving as EMI (electromagnetic interference) antennas.\nA shared knowledge by each motor\ncontroller of the state of all the motors\nin the system at 500 Hz also allows parallel processing of higher-level kinematic\nmatrix calculations.\nThis work was done by William T.\nTownsend, Adam Crowell, and Traveler\nHauptman of Barrett Technology, Inc.; and\nGill Andrews Pratt of Olin College for Johnson Space Center.
