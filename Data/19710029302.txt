INTRODUCTION\nIndustrialization has been the prime factor in stimulating\nthe impressive economic growth of Korea which over the past\ndecade has averaged nearly 10 percent per year, \'ten years ago,\nindustrial products made up about only one fifth of the 43\nmillion dollars in Korean exports, In 1970, however, exports\ntotaled over 1 billion dollars -- four-fifths of which were\nmanufactured g(..:)ds , Today\'s Korean industry is generally labior\nintensive and in many cases based on foreign technology, components and process machinery, Foreign capital outlay, in\nterms of loans, investments, technical\'assistance, and joint\nventures has played a key role in helping Korea both to achieve\nits rapid growth rate and to progress from an agricultural\neconomy to their present state of industrialization.\nThis program represents an experimental approach at providing a developing nation: with an additional technological\nresource to aid and speed its industrial advancement. A pilot\nstudy is 1)eing conducted to determine the feasibility and to\nestablish refined techniques for the transfer of aerospacerelated technology to developing nations, The TIT Research\nInstitute under contract to the National Aeronautics and Space\nAdministration is carrying out this effort in a twenty-four\nmonth program with the Republic of Korea (ROK) , as the selected\nnation. The Agency for International Development has provided\nfunds to NASA in support of this program, The program consists\nof 5 discreet phases: namely,\nPhase I\t\n\n- Technical Mission to Korea and Program\nScheduling\n\nPhase II - Training of Korean Specialists; Organization\nof Total Project and Communications\nPhase III - Technology Identification, Follow-up, and\nTransfer\n\nIIT RESEARCH INSTITUTE\n1\n\nPhase IV - Evaluation and Report\n- Development of Plan for Possible InstitutionPhase V\t\nalized Continuation\nThe scheduling of these phases within the overall program is\nshown in the figure below.\n\n1970\t\n\n1972\n\n1971\t\n\nM J J AS0J\'DJ\'FMAMJ J A 5 0 N D J FMAMJJ\n\nPhase I\nPhase II\nPhase III\nPhase IV\nPhase V\nThe program has as its goals-.\n1,\n\nTrain Korean personnel in transfer methods and technology resources\n\n2,\n\nEvolve and implement modified transfer techniques\napplicable to Korea and the Korea Institute of Science\nand Technology (KIST)\n\n3,\n\nAchieve specific transfers of technology in arias of\npotential economic advantage.\n\n4.\n\nDevelop a revised training and implementation plan.\nbased on successes and failures,\n\n5.\n\nEvaluate the techniques in terms of applicability to\ndeveloping nations in general,\n\nDuring the first six-month period of this program, PhAses\nI and II were successfully completed and met all of their e\nestablished objectives, The Phase \'I visit obtained valuable\ninformation about Korea and the resources available for technology transfer - all of which indicated that the pilot program\nhad a good chance of succeeding. The Korean economy is growing\nrapidly and the government plans and controls indicate strong\nefforts to support continuing growth, Phase II, the training\n\nIIT RESEARCH INSTITUTE\n2\n\nof Korean Specialists, succeeded in establishing a base of expertise in technology transfer at KIST and produced 51 technical\nproblems for processing. Comprehensive literature searches\nfor these problems were performed and, after initial evaluation\nby the KIST Team, 13 problems were identified where potentially\nrelevant technology was located.\nFurther appraisals of the literature searches and detailed\nevaluative and analytical studies of the relevant technology\nfindings, involving technoeconomic surveys, experimental work,\nand feasibility studies, were the initial objectives of Phase\nIII. These efforts were intended to lead to selection of a\nnumber of problems where the technology findings were shown to\nbe applicable and transferable to Korean industry. The initial\nsteps in the transfer strategies involved detailed follow-up\nvisits by KIST specialists to learn all aspects of the technology under consideration. Subsequently, KIST would perform\napplications and developmental engineering, if required, in\norder to promote adoption and commercialization of the technology by a Korean company.\nThis report describes the activities and accomplishments\nof Phase III through June 1971.\n\nIIT RESEARCH INSTITUTE\n3\n\nII.\n\nOVERVIEW\nPhase III aims to accomplish a program of international\n\ntechnology transfer using the groundwork established in the\nprecee0ing phases of the project. The specific transfer mechanism\ninvolves using KIST and its staff as the "gatekeeper" between\nforeign technology sources and Korean industry. KIST performs as\nan active intermediary to channel appropriate technology specifically adapted to Korean needs into their economy. A simplified\nmodel of the overall technology introduction process for Korea\nis shown in Figure 1. The four generalized ways in which Korean\nindustry can obtain new technologies are:\nFirst: A Korean firm may find the expertise and know-how of a\ndesired technology within itself, or obtain it from\nanother Korean company.\nSecond: Some export bonded foreign-based firms have found it\nworthwhile to aid Korean companies in implementing a\nnew technology when this would enable the foreign firms\nto more economically 01 source 10 the domestic market\nfor necessary parts and supplies.\nird:\nThird: Korean business can obtain the technology directly\nfrom a foreign source (usually a company or corporation),\nleading to outright purchase, licensing, technical\nassistance agreements, or joint ventures.\nFourth: The technology can be obtained from outside sources\nthrough the action of intermediaries such as Korean\ngovernment agencies, Korean business associations, or\nKIST.\nPresently, the most widely used methods are the third and\nfourth modes. The latter is the most effective means since\nmost Korean industries do not yet have the expertise necessary\nto pinpoint exact technology requirements or make comprehensive\nevaluations of a specific technology under study.\n\nIIT RESEARCH INSTITUTE\n4\n\nzz\xe2\x80\xa2\nZWw\nIOOW\n0\n\nOu\nW>\n\nG\n\n(\n\nh\n\n"^\n\nG\nI\noro\n\nO\nso\n0 C7\n\nd )\n\nH\nv\n\n41 w\n\n.-1\n\nW\nO\nz\nx\n\ncn\nW\n\nW\n\n^\n\nH\n\nz\n\nH\nu\nloo-11\n\nO\n\nc\'r)\n\nH\nw\n\nO\n\n^\n\nr4\n\n.00,\n\nH\nCY\n\nV\nN\n\nW\nW^H\n\n^ ~ z\n\no H\nw ^\nw\na\n\n0\n\n5\n\n41\n14 W\n\n.\n\xc2\xb0n o\n\nw c\xc2\xb0^\n\nThe methodology of this project is designed to make use of\nthe intermet.iary approach with KIST as the participant. Figure\n2 shows a generalized breakdown of the process of technology\ntransfer to Korean industry through KIST. Basically, KIST\nobtains technical problem definitions (either externally or\ninternally) and brings to bear the available expertise and\ntechnology sources to produce an effective solution which can\nthen be commercialized by Korean industry. The successful\ncompletion of this process for the specific problems identified\nand selected by the participating KIST staff members is essentially the goal of Phase III and the overall program.\nKIST itself is a relatively young organization established\nby government support to interact directly with Korean industry\nand provide the technical research and development necessary\nto bring about technological advancement and diversification.\nOver the past few years, KIST has been recruiting skilled,\nhighly competent scientists to develop their staff. The\ngenerally conservative Korean industrial scene is now beginning\nto accept KIST\'s role as Korea\'s "-echnological change agent."\nOver the past few years, KIST has 1-.jeen establishing itself as\na valuable technological resource in Korea through slow but\nsteady progress in developing industry relations, successful\nperformance of projects for both government and industry\ninvolving important problems of immediate concern, and by\nbuilding up a broad technological base of experience in all\nscientific disciplines.\n\nIIT RESEARCH INSTITUTE\n6\n\n\t\n\n*G A\n\nu\t\n\nu\n\nI\n\nboo\n\na\t\n\nao V \t\nr0\t\n\noo\t\n1O\n\nGOC\t\n\nv0\n\nwa\n.4^\n\nc0\t\n\nHU\n\n4) no\n\nO w\nAa\n\ncn\n\nA\n\t8\n\n\t\n\nH \xe2\x96\xbaa\t\n\n1-4\no\t\n\nw\t\n\na\t\n0\n\nG\n\n8\t\n\na\to\n\na\n\nw\nH\n\nz\n4-, \'\nz\n\nH\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nC7\n\n^j\n\nH\n\nH\n^\t\n\nW\n\nH vOi\n\nH\t\n\nz ox\n^ 3z\nz\nf^4 0\nz\n\n9\n\nw^\xe2\x80\x94+^40\nH\n~cH i^pU\n\na4 O W\n\nAw\nHOO\n\nORS\nWH\nW\n7\t\n\n..\n\nF_\n\nIII. DISCUSSION\nOn returning to Korea at the end of Phase II, the KIST\nProject Team reviewed the literature search results, conducted\nevaluations and established priorities for the pursuit of eaciL\nproblem. An early decision was made to focus the follow-up\neffort on those problems dealing with electronics technology.\nThis decision was made for the following reasons;\nConcentration of resources on a single industry would\ninsure a technology transfer which could then be used\nto demonstrate the concept to other industries.\nAerospace technology applicable to the electronics\nproblems was found during the Phase II activities,\nThe Korean electronics industry is reasonably well\nadvanced,\nThis decision and the supporting analyses led to the\nselection of four problems for heavy follow-up in the U.S,, by\nKIST personnel and the selection a \xe2\x80\xa2 r. ^)dditional four problems\nfor longer range follow-up and transfer. The problems selected\nin each category are listed in Table I. Four KIST researchers\nspent a total of four man months in the U.S. working with\nIITRI personnel to follow-up on these problems., Three of the\nfour were new to the technology transfer program, They were\nselected because their backgrounds fit the problems being\npursued and also to expose other Koreans to the project concept.\nForty-four organizations were contacted to discuss all aspects\nof the technology under consideration. The details of the\nvisits are included as Appendix I, Before each visit, IITRI[\nconducted pre-visit studies, prepared additional data packages\nrelevant to the topic being; pursued., and arranged for on site\nvisits with a variety of aerospace contractors, NASA Field\nCenters, and industrial companies. A synopsis of\n\nt?)e\n\nkey\n\nevents and the status of each active problem is presented in\nthe following paragraphs,\n\n\'IT RESEARCH INSTITUTE\n8\n\nTABLE I: PROBLEMS SELECTED FOR FOLLOW-UP\n\nSelected for In ge tp h Follow-Up\nMiniature Transceivers\nHigh Sensitivity Transceivers\nSolid Tantalum Electrolytic Capacitors\n\' Technology of Inductorless Circuits\nSelected for Limited F ollow -Up and Monitoring\n\' Retort Pouch as a Flexible Can\n\n\' Survival Rations\n\' Carbon Monoxide Elimination\n\' Explosive Metalforming\n\nIIT RESEARCH INSTITUTE\n9\n\nSelected for Heavy Follow -U,\nMiniature Transceivers\nThis problem consists of two sub-problems:\n1,\n\nThe development of an improved citizens band transceiver,\n\n2,\n\nThe development of military transceivers.\n\nKIST is presently sponsored by Han Jin Electronics to develop a\ncommercial prototype citizens band transceiver. Drs. Chung\nand Sohn followed up on this problem in the U.S. and visited\nthree NASA Field Centers, and fifteen aerospace contractors and\nindustrial firms, Final technology selection has not been made\nbut it appears that it will be s combination of commercial and\nNASA technology, The aerospace technology applicable to this\neffort includes integrated antennas developed by Jet Propulsion\nLaboratories, integrated circuit technology developed by Westinghouse under contract to NASA, and circuitry from the Apollo\nsuit communications set developed by RCA, A prototype is tentatively scheduled for completion by December 1971.\t\nThe development of improved military transceivers is sponsored by the Korean Ministry of Science and Technology under a\ntwo-phase program. The first phase involves converting old\ntube-type transceivers to solid state circuitry. Aerospace\ntechnology similar to that described for the citizens band\ntransceiver may be selected for the first prototype. Prototype\ncompletion is scheduled for June 1972. A second prototype will\nbe an original design and in addition to the technology described above, phase-lock-loop technology may be used. A combination of aerospace technology developed at Goddard, JPL,\nand the Air Force and commercial technology may be used in\ndeveloping the phase-lock-loop. In addition, a new technique\nfor designing high frequency electronic circuits without the\nuse of inductors, developed by Goddard Space Fligh" Center,\nis being considered.\n\nIIT RESEARCH INSTITUTE\n10\n\nA\n\nHigh Sensitivity Transceivers\nRather than a specific problem needing a solution, this\narea represents the Koreans\' need to develop capabilities in\na new technology and exploit its applications along a broad\nfront. Based on the improved capabilities of phase-lock.-loop\ntechnology to increase receiver sensitivity and stability, Drs,\nChung and Sohn foresee applications in TV repeater networks,\nmilitary transceivers, and commercial transceivers, They have\nan immediate interest in the applications of this technology\nto T1\' repeater network design, A decision on, the use of this\ntechnology is expected by December, 1971,\nSolid Tantalum Electratic Capacitors\n.\nThe Koreans wish to establish a complete manufacturing\ncapability for these capacitors, Aerospace technology has\nplayed a key role in developing U.S. capabilities in this area.\nAerospace technology will be particularly useful to the Koreans\nin the areas of quality control and reliability engineering,\nDr. Yoon visited seven aerospace contrac t, ors and industrial\nfirms while visiting the U.3. A decision \'to develop an initial\npilot facility is expected by December 1971.\nTechnology of Inductorless Circuits\nThis area is again indicative of a need to exploit a\nbasic technology to a number of application areas. Dr, Park\nvisited Goddard Space Flight Center, the developer of the\ntechnology, and Gaertner Research, Inc., a Goddard con?"ractor.\nIn addition to commercial and military transceiver applications.\nDr. Park foresees use of the technique in color `,TV circuits,\nelectronic calculators, and various portable, low power-drain\ndevices. IITRI is presently awaiting word from Dr. Park concerning additional application engineering projects,\n\nIIT RESEARCH INSTITUTE\n11\n\nSele!ted For Limited Follow-Up and Monitoring\nRetort Pouch as a Flexible Can\nBased on a search of the Aerospace Data Bank, Dr. Kwon\nidentified a new packaging material which would be useful to\nthe Korean food industry. Rights to this technology belong\nto Continental (3an Corporation, and KIST is currently conducting\npreliminary inquiries about obtaining a license.\n\nSurvival Rations\nA search of the Aerospace Data Bank revealed a substantial\namount of information concerning new food developments and\nsurvival rations. Dr. Kwon used this information to assist\nhim in structuring a research program at KIST. The project is\npresently being sponsored by the Korean Army. The project\nteam will supply additional information in support of this\nactivity as needed.\nCarbon Monoxide Elimination\nKorea needs improved technology for carbon monoxide\nelimination in gas masks. While a search of the Aerospace\nData Bank did not reveal any immediately applicable technology,\nit was identified that the Army Natick Labs had sponsored a\nsubstantial amount of research in this area. Contact with\nthe laboratory will be maintained and any new 0,^velopments will\nbe communicated to the Koreans.\n\nExplosive Metalforming\nThe Koreans wish to establish a pilot facility to demonstrate the effectiveness of explosive metalforming techniques.\nDuring Phase II, Dr. Yoon inspected a major facility at the\nDenver Research Institute. After his return, a cost estimate\nwas prepared indicating the level of resources needed to \t\nestablish a facility in Korea. Dr. Yoon coordinated with\n\nIIT RESEARCH INSTITUTE\n12\n\ni\n\nKorean industry to determine the characteristics of the metals\nand parts that might be formed. Based on these inputs he has\n\nconcluded that the facil i-.t^, is not cost effective at the present\ntime but could become so within the next few years. These\nfactors will be again reviewed towards the end of the present\nprogram,\nInterim Evaluation Meetin&\nA key event towards the end of the period was an interim\n\nevaluation meeting. In addition to the 11TRI project team,\nNASA, and AID, three Koreans traveled to the U.S. to discuss\nprogram results and their view of tle project, They were:\n1, Dr, Hyung S, Choi, President of the Korea Institute\n\nof Science and Technology\n2. Mr. Hyun K. Kim, Ministry of Science and Technology,\nRepublic of Korea.\n3., Dr. Young Ku Yoon, KIST project leader,\nShortly after his arrival in the U.S., Dr, Choi learned of his\nappointment, by President Chung He Park, to be the Minister\nof Science and Technology. Though under pressure to return to\nKorea immediately, Dr. Choi felt it important to remain in the\nU.S. and participate in the evaluation meetings., IITRI believes\nthis is indicative of the Korean commitment to the program\nand of its visibility.\nIn addition to reporting on the status and progress of\nthe transfer activities in Korea, Dr, Choi made a number of\nsalient points and observations, He emphasized the fragmented\nnature of the infrastructure of developing nations anu the\ncorresponding need to bring in major new commercial manufacturing\ncapabilities, Thus, technology transfers from this program\nare likely to be a mixture of both aerospace technology and\ncommercial U.S. practice. He stated that an added benefit of\nthis program was that }he affiliation with AID and NASA\n\nIIT RESEARCH INSTITUTE\n13\n\nI\t\n\nr- ;f-\t\n\n,\n\ni\n\nassisted KIST in their job of promoting the concept of R&D to\nthe generally conservative Korean industrial scene.\nDr. Choi expressed some concern about the time scale of\nthe technology transfer project. He emphasized that the time\nrequired to move from prototype development into manufacturing\nwas considerably longer in Korea than in a developed nation\ndue to the need to train Koreans in a variety of new skills.\nAn example, cited by Dr. Choi, was the manufacture of TV remote\ncontrol units which took KIST three yea ,-\xe2\x80\xa2 s to implement.\nAn early indication of institutionalization of the technology transfer program was cited by Dr. Choi. Dr. Hyun, one\nof the original team participants, has been appointed Head of\nthe Information Sciences Group at KIST. He has been assigned\nthe task of educating others at KIST, defining new problems,\npreparation of problem statements for transmittal to IITRI, and\nevaluation of search results. Approximately twenty new problems\nwill be identified and submitted to IITRI for processing.\nIn summary, Dr. Choi was quite pleased with the results\nand progress of the program. He expressed confidence in the\nprogress that his staff was making on the applications engineering\nprograms related to the four potential transfer areas. He felt\nthat the program was important, would continue to have high\nvisibility within KIST, and that he would maintain an active\ninterest in the program while performing his new duties as\nMinister of Science and Technology.\n\n1\n\nIIT RESEARCH INSTITUTE\n14\n\nAL ..._J\n\nr\n\nIV. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS\nWith the completion of the Phase III activities to date,\nthe following conclusions can be made:\n1.\n\nThe Phase III activities and the overall program has\nbeen successful and is meeting its stated objectives.\n-- A total of 51 problems were defined and processed,\nproducing potentially transferable technology for\n13. After further evaluation, KIST plans continued\nfollow-up on eight problems of which 4 are progressing toward hard transfer.\n-- Phase III has provided follow-up trips in the U.1,3.\nfor 6 Korean participants with a total of about\n5 r_:an months of activity in the U.S.\nBecause of a fragmented infrastructure, the technology required is a mix of aerospace and commerical\ntechnology.\n-- This program is enabling KIST to make progress in\npromoting the concept of R&D to the generally\nconservative Korean industrial scene.\n\n2.\n\nImplementing technology transfers will take longer\nthan originally anticipated.\n-- Study, analysis and evaluation of the large amount\nof technical information obtained from the NASA\ndata bank has been accomplished within the time\nframe originally specified. However, since KIST\nhas only recently embarked on an applications\nengineering program, hardware development time of\n6-12 months is anticipated.\n\nIIT RESEARCH INSTITUTE\n15\n\n-- Since Korean industry is in its developing stages,\nKIST requires a substantial block of time to assist\nindustry with developing their manufacturing capabilities and to train appropriate staff,.\n-- Within the confines of KIST resources and time\navailable for development, only a limited number\nof problems can be pursued.\n3. Progress towards institutionalization has been made.\n-- A decision to focus remaining resources on the\narea of electronics was made by KIST. Upon\ndemonstrating success in this area, they will be\nable to approach other industries and will have\nan easier time of demonstrating the program\'s\nvalue.\n-- Dr. Hyun, one of the original team participants,\nhas been appointed the Head of the Information\nSciences Group at KIST. He has been assigned the,\ntask of educating others at KIST, defining new\nproblems, preparation of problem statements for\ntransmittal to IITRI, and evaluation of search\nresults.\nBased on these conclusions the following recommendations\nare presented:\n1. Technology transfer should be defined as follows:\nTransfer will occur when prototypes are developed\nat KIST as a direct result of the technology transfer\nefforts of this program, and a commitment is obtained\nfrom a Korean company agreeing to go into commercial\nproduction.\n\nIIT RESEARCH INSTITUTE\n16\n\nr\n\nt\n\n2.\n\nBecause the KIST prototype development programs are\nplanned for completion by June 1972, the program should\nbe extended 6 months and a new completion date set for\nJune 22, 1972. This extension will also allow for a\nmore comprehensive evaluation of the program which\nwill take place in Korea in the spring of 1972.\n\n3.\n\nApproximately 20 additional problems should be defined\nin Korea, searched by IITRI, and evaluated by KIST\nas the basis for a continuing program. The following\nfigure shows the revised program.\n\n4.\n\nConsideration should be given to expanding the technology transfer process to other Korean priority areas\nsuch as housing, heavy machinery, and secondary petrochemicals\n\nIIT RESEARCH INSTITUTE\n17\n_J\n\n\t\nF_\n\nr\t\n\n.\'\n\nPlan Based on Recommendations 2 and 3.\n\nNew Prob lem\nSubmission\n\nSearch for\nSolutions\n\nKIST Applications\nEngineering\n\nProgram\nEvaluation\nin Korea\n\nFinal Analysis\nand Evaluation\n\nPrepare Final\nReport\n\nAug.
