A total of 561 thunderstorms have\nbeen examined in the past year (409 non-severe, 152 severe) from four regions of the\ncountry (North Alabama, Washington D.C., High Plains of CO/KS, and Oklahoma).\nResults continue to indicate that the 2\xcf\x83 lightning jump algorithm configuration\nholds the most promise in terms of prospective operational lightning jump algorithms,\nwith a probability of detection (POD) at 81%, a false alarm rate (FAR) of 45%, a critical\nsuccess index (CSI) of 49% and a Heidke Skill Score (HSS) of 0.66. The second best\nperforming algorithm configuration was the Threshold 4 algorithm, which had a POD of\n72%, FAR of 51%, a CSI of 41% and an HSS of 0.58. Because a more complex\nalgorithm configuration shows the most promise in terms of prospective operational\nlightning jump algorithms, accurate thunderstorm cell tracking work must be undertaken\nto track lightning trends on an individual thunderstorm basis over time.\nWhile these numbers for the 2\xcf\x83 configuration are impressive, the algorithm does\nhave its weaknesses. Specifically, low-topped and tropical cyclone thunderstorm\nenvironments are present issues for the 2\xcf\x83 lightning jump algorithm, because of the\nsuppressed vertical depth impact on overall flash counts (i.e., a relative dearth in\nlightning). For example, in a sample of 120 thunderstorms from northern Alabama that\ncontained 72 missed events by the 2\xcf\x83 algorithm 36% of the misses were associated with\nthese two environments (17 storms).\nOut of the larger sample of 561 thunderstorms, 30 storms were chosen to compare\ntotal lightning trends to CG trends in order to demonstrate the added utility that total\nlightning information provides. Thunderstorms were chosen based on their high total\nflash rates, region of the country, and type of thunderstorm. The 2\xcf\x83 lightning jump\nconfiguration was used for identification of lightning jumps in the total lightning and CG\nlightning datasets. Results clearly indicate that total lightning trends outperform CG\nlightning trends, especially during the early stages of the thunderstorm.\nThere were two main examples that stood out in this comparison. The first\nexample was from a severe thunderstorm from June 20, 2000 in Eastern Colorado and\nWestern Kansas. Total lightning trends for this thunderstorm indicate that there were 7\nlightning jumps indicated during the lifetime of the thunderstorm, with a peak total flash\nrate of 108 flashes per minute. Meanwhile, the CG data trends indicated zero lightning\njumps during this same period of time with a peak CG flash rate of 2 flashes per minute.\nFour instances of severe weather were reported with this storm, all high wind damage.\nThe total lightning jumps averaged 33 minutes of lead time prior to the high wind events,\n\nwhile there was not a single CG lightning jump during the entire period, leading to four\nmissed events.\nA second notable example occurred in Eastern AL on April, 18, 2006. Here total\nlightning trends indicated that there were four lightning jumps, with a peak total flash rate\nof 56 flashes per minute. Meanwhile, the CG lightning trends again indicated zero CG\nlightning jumps, with a peak CG flash rate of 2 flashes per minute. Six instances of\nsevere weather were observed, including hail to the size of golfballs. The total lightning\ntrend information was able to detect all six instances with an average lead time of 28\nminutes. Meanwhile, the CG lightning trend data indicated zero lightning jumps;\ntherefore, all 6 events were missed.\nFor the total lightning trends, the probability of detection (POD) was 93%, a false\nalarm rate (FAR) of 26%, a critical success index of 70% and a Heidke Skill Score of\n0.82. For the same thunderstorm samples using CG data the POD was 66%, FAR of\n25%, CSI of 54% and a HSS of 0.70. Thus, total lightning information has distinct\nadvantages over CG lightning information.\n\n'
