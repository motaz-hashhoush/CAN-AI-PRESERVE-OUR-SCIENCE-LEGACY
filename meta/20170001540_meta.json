However, the allocated bands are spread across a wide swath of spectrum: fifth generation mobile architecture (5G): 28, 38, 39, 64-71 GHz, as well as Industrial, Scientific, and Medical bands (ISM): 24 and 60 GHz. Moreover, high gain phased arrays are required to overcome the significant path loss associated with these frequencies. Further, it is necessary to incorporate several of these applications in a single, small size and low cost platform. To this end, we have developed a scanning, Ultra-Wideband (UWB) array which covers all 5G, ISM, and other mm-W bands from 24-72 GHz. Critically, this is accomplished using mass-production Printed Circuit Board (PCB) fabrication.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20170001540, "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers", "location": "New York, NY, United States"}}, "meetingId": "31590da741d148bca785e62fa77103aa", "id": "ad815b55c1ce4fd59358440c25a00f71"}], "name": "IEEE AP-S / MTT-S Columbus Chapter Graduate Student Poster Competition", "location": "Columbus, OH.", "id": "31590da741d148bca785e62fa77103aa", "startDate": "2016-11-16T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20170001540, "id": "f288a3a5bceb4f73a534f519ac041ea3", "publicationDate": "2016-11-16T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20170001540.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20170001540/downloads/20170001540.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20170001540/downloads/20170001540.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20170001540/downloads/20170001540.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
