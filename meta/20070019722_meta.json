In the upper photo is a leg-supported gravity platform; the other structure is a \"jackettype\" platform, built in sections, towed to sea and assembled on-site. In construction of platforms like these, Exxon Production Research Company, Houston, Texas, conducts extensive structural investigations of decks, supporting members and other platform components, making use of the NASTRAN @ (NASA Structural Analysis) computer program. NASTRAN is a predictive tool which analyzes a computerized design and reports how the structure will react to a great many conditions it will encounter in its operational environment; in this case, NASTRAN studies the effects of waves, winds, ocean storms and other stress-inducing factors. NASTRAN allows Exxon Production Research to perform more complex and more detailed analysis than was possible with previous programs. The same program has also been used by Exxon Research and Engineering Company, Florham Park, New Jersey, in analysis of pressure vessels, turbine components and composite building boards.", "title": "Oil Industry Aids", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-23T23:03:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-09-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20070019722, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20070019722, "id": "d23198db00cd4fb3a982febb1489925c", "publicationName": "Spinoff 1979", "publicationDate": "1979-02-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 20070019711, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "Spinoff 1979", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20070019722.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20070019722/downloads/20070019722.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20070019722/downloads/20070019722.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20070019722/downloads/20070019722.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
