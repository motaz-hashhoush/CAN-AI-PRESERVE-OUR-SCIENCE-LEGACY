b'9\n\nExtreme Storms\n\nKEY FINDINGS\n1.\t Human activities have contributed substantially to observed ocean\xe2\x80\x93atmosphere variability in the Atlantic Ocean (medium confidence), and these changes have contributed to the observed upward trend in\nNorth Atlantic hurricane activity since the 1970s (medium confidence).\n2.\t Both theory and numerical modeling simulations generally indicate an increase in tropical cyclone\n(TC) intensity in a warmer world, and the models generally show an increase in the number of very\nintense TCs. For Atlantic and eastern North Pacific hurricanes and western North Pacific typhoons,\nincreases are projected in precipitation rates (high confidence) and intensity (medium confidence). The\nfrequency of the most intense of these storms is projected to increase in the Atlantic and western North\nPacific (low confidence) and in the eastern North Pacific (medium confidence).\n3.\t Tornado activity in the United States has become more variable, particularly over the 2000s, with a\ndecrease in the number of days per year with tornadoes and an increase in the number of tornadoes\non these days (medium confidence). Confidence in past trends for hail and severe thunderstorm winds,\nhowever, is low. Climate models consistently project environmental changes that would putatively\nsupport an increase in the frequency and intensity of severe thunderstorms (a category that combines\ntornadoes, hail, and winds), especially over regions that are currently prone to these hazards, but confidence in the details of this projected increase is low.\n4.\t There has been a trend toward earlier snowmelt and a decrease in snowstorm frequency on the southern margins of climatologically snowy areas (medium confidence). Winter storm tracks have shifted\nnorthward since 1950 over the Northern Hemisphere (medium confidence). Projections of winter storm\nfrequency and intensity over the United States vary from increasing to decreasing depending on\nregion, but model agreement is poor and confidence is low. Potential linkages between the frequency\nand intensity of severe winter storms in the United States and accelerated warming in the Arctic have\nbeen postulated, but they are complex, and, to some extent, contested, and confidence in the connection is currently low.\n5.\t The frequency and severity of landfalling \xe2\x80\x9catmospheric rivers\xe2\x80\x9d on the U.S. West Coast (narrow streams\nof moisture that account for 30%\xe2\x80\x9340% of the typical snowpack and annual precipitation in the region\nand are associated with severe flooding events) will increase as a result of increasing evaporation and\nresulting higher atmospheric water vapor that occurs with increasing temperature.

Quantifying how broadscale average climate influences the behavior\nof extreme storms is particularly challenging,\nin part because extreme storms are comparatively rare short-lived events and occur within\nan environment of largely random variability.\nAdditionally, because the physical mechanisms linking climate change and extreme\nstorms can manifest in a variety of ways, even\nthe sign of the changes in the extreme storms\ncan vary in a warming climate. This makes\ndetection and attribution of trends in extreme\nstorm characteristics more difficult than detection and attribution of trends in the larger\nenvironment in which the storms evolve (e.g.,\nCh. 6: Temperature Change). Projecting changes in severe storms is also challenging because\nof model constraints in how they capture and\nrepresent small-scale, highly local physics.\nDespite the challenges, good progress is being\nmade for a variety of storm types, such as\ntropical cyclones, severe convective storms\n(thunderstorms), winter storms, and atmospheric river events.\n\n9.2 Tropical Cyclones (Hurricanes and\nTyphoons)\nDetection and attribution (Ch. 3: Detection and\nAttribution) of past changes in tropical cyclone\n(TC) behavior remain a challenge due to the\nnature of the historical data, which are highly\nheterogeneous in both time and among the various regions that collect and analyze the data.1,\n2, 3\nWhile there are ongoing efforts to reanalyze\nand homogenize the data (e.g., Landsea et\nal.\xc2\xa02015;4 Kossin et al.\xc2\xa020132), there is still low\nconfidence that any reported long-term (multidecadal to centennial) increases in TC activity\nare robust, after accounting for past changes\nin observing capabilities [which is unchanged\nfrom the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate\nChange Fifth Assessment Report (IPCC AR5)\nassessment statement5]. This is not meant to\n\nU.S. Global Change Research Program\n\nimply that no such increases have occurred, but\nrather that the data are not of a high enough\nquality to determine this with much confidence. Furthermore, it has been argued that\nwithin the period of highest data quality (since\naround 1980), the globally observed changes in\nthe environment would not necessarily support\na detectable trend in tropical cyclone intensity.2\nThat is, the trend signal has not yet had time to\nrise above the background variability of natural\nprocesses.\nBoth theory and numerical modeling simulations (in general) indicate an increase in TC\nintensity in a warmer world, and the models\ngenerally show an increase in the number of\nvery intense TCs.6, 7, 8, 9, 10 In some cases, climate\nmodels can be used to make attribution statements about TCs without formal detection\n(see also Ch.\xc2\xa03: Detection and Attribution). For\nexample, there is evidence that, in addition to\nthe effects of El Ni\xc3\xb1o, anthropogenic forcing\nmade the extremely active 2014 Hawaiian\nhurricane season substantially more likely,\nalthough no significant rising trend in TC frequency near Hawai\xe2\x80\x98i was detected.11\nChanges in frequency and intensity are not\nthe only measures of TC behavior that may be\naffected by climate variability and change, and\nthere is evidence that the locations where TCs\nreach their peak intensity has migrated poleward over the past 30 years in the Northern\nand Southern Hemispheres, apparently in concert with environmental changes associated\nwith the independently observed expansion\nof the tropics.12 The poleward migration in\nthe western North Pacific,13 which includes a\nnumber of U.S. territories, appears particularly consistent among the various available TC\ndatasets and remains significant over the past\n60\xe2\x80\x9370 years after accounting for the known\nmodes of natural variability in the region (Figure 9.1). The migration, which can substantially change patterns of TC hazard exposure and\n\n258\n\nClimate Science Special Report\n\n9 | Extreme Storms\nmortality risk, is also evident in 21st century\nCoupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase\n5 (CMIP5) projections following the RCP8.5\nemissions trajectories, suggesting a possible\nlink to human activities. Further analysis comparing observed past TC behavior with climate model historical forcing runs (and with\nmodel control runs simulating multidecadal\ninternal climate variability alone) are needed\nto better understand this process, but it is expected that this will be an area of heightened\nfuture research.\n\nDeparture from Average Latitude (\xc2\xb0)\n\nIn the Atlantic, observed multidecadal variability of the ocean and atmosphere, which TCs are\nshown to respond to, has been ascribed (Ch. 3:\nDetection and Attribution) to natural internal\nvariability via meridional overturning ocean\ncirculation changes,14 natural external variability caused by volcanic eruptions15, 16 and Saharan dust outbreaks,17, 18 and anthropogenic ex-\n\nternal forcing via greenhouse gases and sulfate\naerosols.19, 20, 21 Determining the relative contributions of each mechanism to the observed\nmultidecadal variability in the Atlantic, and\neven whether natural or anthropogenic factors\nhave dominated, is presently a very active area\nof research and debate, and no consensus has\nyet been reached.22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27 Despite the level\nof disagreement about the relative magnitude\nof human influences, there is broad agreement\nthat human factors have had an impact on the\nobserved oceanic and atmospheric variability\nin the North Atlantic, and there is medium confidence that this has contributed to the observed\nincrease in hurricane activity since the 1970s.\nThis is essentially unchanged from the IPCC\nAR5 statement,6 although the post-AR5 literature has only served to further support this\nstatement.28 This is expected to remain an active\nresearch topic in the foreseeable future.\n\n3\n2\n1\n0\n\xe2\x88\x921\n\xe2\x88\x922\n\xe2\x88\x923\n\n0.21\xc2\xb0\xc2\xb1 0.13\xc2\xb0per decade\n1945 1955 1965 1975 1985 1995 2005 2015\nYear\n\nFigure 9.1: Poleward migration, in degrees of latitude, of the location of annual mean tropical cyclone (TC) peak\nlifetime intensity in the western North Pacific Ocean, after accounting for the known regional modes of interannual\n(El Ni\xc3\xb1o\xe2\x80\x93Southern Oscillation; ENSO) and interdecadal (Pacific Decadal Oscillation; PDO) variability.

Since the IPCC AR5, some\nstudies have provided additional support for\nthis consensus, and some have challenged\nan aspect of it. For example, a recent study9\nprojects increased mean hurricane intensities\nin the Atlantic Ocean basin and in most, but\nnot all, other TC-supporting basins (see Table\n3 in Knutson et al. 20159).\xc2\xa0In their study, the\nglobal occurrence of Saffir\xe2\x80\x93Simpson Category\n4\xe2\x80\x935 storms was projected to increase significantly, with the most significant basin-scale\nchanges projected for the Northeast Pacific\nbasin, potentially increasing intense hurricane\nrisk to Hawai\xe2\x80\x98i (Figure 9.2) over the coming\ncentury. However, another recent (post-AR5)\nstudy proposed that increased thermal stratification of the upper ocean in CMIP5 climate\nwarming scenarios should substantially\nreduce the warming-induced intensification of\nTCs estimated in previous studies.29 Follow-up\nstudies, however, estimate that the effect of\nsuch increased stratification is relatively small,\nreducing the projected intensification of TCs\nby only about 10%\xe2\x80\x9315%.30, 31\nAnother recent study challenged the IPCC\nAR5 consensus projection of a decrease, or\nlittle change, in global tropical cyclone frequency by simulating increased global TC\nfrequency over the 21st century under the\nhigher scenario (RCP8.5).32 However, another\nmodeling study has found that neither direct analysis of CMIP5-class simulations, nor\nindirect inferences from the simulations (such\nas those of Emanuel 201332), could reproduce\nthe decrease in TC frequency projected in a\nwarmer world by high-resolution TC-permitting climate models,33 which adds uncertainty\nto the results of Emanuel.32\n\nU.S. Global Change Research Program\n\nIn summary, despite new research that challenges one aspect of the AR5 consensus for\nlate 21st century-projected TC activity, it remains likely that global mean tropical cyclone\nmaximum wind speeds and precipitation rates\nwill increase; and it is more likely than not that\nthe global frequency of occurrence of TCs\nwill either decrease or remain essentially the\nsame. Confidence in projected global increases\nof intensity and tropical cyclone precipitation rates is medium and high, respectively, as\nthere is better model consensus. Confidence is\nfurther heightened, particularly for projected\nincreases in precipitation rates, by a robust\nphysical understanding of the processes that\nlead to these increases. Confidence in projected increases in the frequency of very intense\nTCs is generally lower (medium in the eastern\nNorth Pacific and low in the western North Pacific and Atlantic) due to comparatively fewer\nstudies available and due to the competing\ninfluences of projected reductions in overall\nstorm frequency and increased mean intensity\non the frequency of the most intense storms.\nBoth the magnitude and sign of projected\nchanges in individual ocean basins appears to\ndepend on the large-scale pattern of changes\nto atmospheric circulation and ocean surface\ntemperature (e.g., Knutson et al. 20159). Projections of these regional patterns of change\xe2\x80\x94\napparently critical for TC projections\xe2\x80\x94are\nuncertain, leading to uncertainty in regional\nTC projections.\n\n260\n\nClimate Science Special Report\n\n9 | Extreme Storms\na)\n\nb)\n\n45\xc2\xb0N\n30\xc2\xb0N\n15\xc2\xb0N\n0\xc2\xb0\n15\xc2\xb0S\n30\xc2\xb0S\n45\xc2\xb0S\n\n45\xc2\xb0N\n30\xc2\xb0N\n15\xc2\xb0N\n0\xc2\xb0\n15\xc2\xb0S\n30\xc2\xb0S\n45\xc2\xb0S\n\nPresent Day Simulation: 244 Cat 4\xe2\x80\x935 storms\n\nStorm Category\n0\xc2\xb0\n\n30\xc2\xb0E 60\xc2\xb0E 90\xc2\xb0E 120\xc2\xb0E 150\xc2\xb0E 180\xc2\xb0 150\xc2\xb0W120\xc2\xb0W 90\xc2\xb0W 60\xc2\xb0W 30\xc2\xb0W\n\n0\xc2\xb0\n\nRCP4.5 Late 21st Century: 313 Cat 4\xe2\x80\x935 storms\n\n0\xc2\xb0\n\n30\xc2\xb0E 60\xc2\xb0E 90\xc2\xb0E 120\xc2\xb0E 150\xc2\xb0E 180\xc2\xb0 150\xc2\xb0W120\xc2\xb0W 90\xc2\xb0W 60\xc2\xb0W 30\xc2\xb0W\n\nTS\nHR1\nHR2\nHR3\nHR4\nHR5\n\n0\xc2\xb0\n\nFigure 9.2: Tracks of simulated Saffir\xe2\x80\x93Simpson Category 4\xe2\x80\x935 tropical cyclones for (a) present-day or (b) late-21st-century conditions, based on dynamical downscaling of climate conditions from the CMIP5 multimodel ensemble (lower\nscenario; RCP4.5).

The 11-year (2006\xe2\x80\x932016)\nabsence of U.S. major hurricane landfall events is unprecedented in the historical records dating back to the mid19th century and has occurred in tandem with average to above-average basin-wide major hurricane counts.\nWas the 11-year absence of U.S. landfalling major hurricanes due to random luck, or were there systematic\nchanges in climate that drove this?\nOne recent study indicates that the absence of U.S. landfalling major hurricanes cannot readily be attributed to\nany sustained changes in the climate patterns that affect hurricanes.34 Based on a statistical analysis of the historical North Atlantic hurricane database, the study found no evidence of a connection between the number of\nmajor U.S. landfalls from one year to the next and concluded that the 11-year absence of U.S. landfalling major\nhurricanes was random. A subsequent recent study did identify a systematic pattern of atmosphere/ocean conditions that vary in such a way that conditions conducive to hurricane intensification in the deep tropics occur in\nconcert with conditions conducive to weakening near the U.S. coast.35 This result suggests a possible relationship\nbetween climate and hurricanes; increasing basin-wide hurricane counts are associated with a decreasing fraction of major hurricanes making U.S. landfall, as major hurricanes approaching the U.S. coast are more likely to\n\nU.S. Global Change Research Program\n\n261\n\nClimate Science Special Report\n\n9 | Extreme Storms\n\nBox 9.1 (continued)\nweaken during active North Atlantic hurricane periods (such as the present period). It is unclear to what degree\nthis relationship has affected absolute hurricane landfall counts during the recent active hurricane period from\nthe mid-1990s, as the basin-wide number and landfalling fraction are in opposition (that is, there are more major hurricanes but a smaller fraction make landfall as major hurricanes). It is also unclear how this relationship\nmay change as the climate continues to warm. Other studies have identified systematic interdecadal hurricane\ntrack variability that may affect landfalling hurricane and major hurricane frequency.36, 37, 38\nAnother recent study39 shows that the extent of the absence is sensitive to uncertainties in the historical data\nand even small variations in the definition of a major hurricane, which is somewhat arbitrary. It is also sensitive\nto the definition of U.S. landfall, which is a geopolitical-border-based constraint and has no physical meaning.\nIn fact, many areas outside of the U.S. border have experienced major hurricane landfalls in the past 11 years.\nIn this sense, the frequency of U.S. landfalling major hurricanes is not a particularly robust metric with which\nto study questions about hurricane activity and its relationship with climate variability. Furthermore, the 11year absence of U.S. landfalling major hurricanes is not a particularly relevant metric in terms of coastal hazard\nexposure and risk. For example, Hurricanes Ike (2008), Irene (2011), Sandy (2012), and most recently Hurricane\nMatthew (2016) brought severe impacts to the U.S. coast despite not making landfall in the United States while\nclassified as major hurricanes. In the case of Hurricane Sandy, extreme rainfall and storm surge (see also Ch.\n12: Sea Level Rise) during landfall caused extensive destruction in and around the New York City area, despite\nSandy\xe2\x80\x99s designation as a post-tropical cyclone at that time. In the case of Hurricane Matthew, the center came\nwithin about 40 miles of the Florida coast while Matthew was a major hurricane, which is close enough to significantly impact the coast but not close enough to break the \xe2\x80\x9cdrought\xe2\x80\x9d as it is defined.\nIn summary, the absence of U.S. landfalling major hurricanes from Wilma in 2005 to Harvey in 2017 was anomalous. There is some evidence that systematic atmosphere/ocean variability has reduced the fraction of hurricanes making U.S. landfall since the mid-1990s, but this is at least partly countered by increased basin-wide\nnumbers, and the net effect on landfall rates is unclear. Moreover, there is a large random element, and the metric itself suffers from lack of physical basis due to the arbitrary intensity threshold and geopolitically based constraints. Additionally, U.S. coastal risk, particularly from storm surge and freshwater flooding, depends strongly\non storm size, propagation speed and direction, and rainfall rates. There is some danger, in the form of evoking\ncomplacency, in placing too much emphasis on an absence of a specific subset of hurricanes.\n\n9.3 Severe Convective Storms\n(Thunderstorms)\nTornado and severe thunderstorm events\ncause significant loss of life and property:\nmore than one-third of the $1 billion weather\ndisasters in the United States during the past\n25 years were due to such events, and, relative\nto other extreme weather, the damages from\nconvective weather hazards have undergone\nthe largest increase since 1980.40 A particular\nchallenge in quantifying the existence and\nintensity of these events arises from the data\n\nU.S. Global Change Research Program\n\nsource: rather than measurements, the occurrence of tornadoes and severe thunderstorms\nis determined by visual sightings by eyewitnesses (such as \xe2\x80\x9cstorm spotters\xe2\x80\x9d and law\nenforcement officials) or post-storm damage\nassessments. The reporting has been susceptible to changes in population density, modifications to reporting procedures and training, the\nintroduction of video and social media, and so\non. These have led to systematic, non-meteorological biases in the long-term data record.\n\n262\n\nClimate Science Special Report\n\n9 | Extreme Storms\nNonetheless, judicious use of the report\ndatabase has revealed important information\nabout tornado trends. Since the 1970s, the\nUnited States has experienced a decrease in\nthe number of days per year on which tornadoes occur, but an increase in the number\nof tornadoes that form on such days.41 One\nimportant implication is that the frequency of\ndays with large numbers of tornadoes\xe2\x80\x94tornado outbreaks\xe2\x80\x94appears to be increasing (Figure 9.3). The extent of the season over which\nsuch tornado activity occurs is increasing as\nwell: although tornadoes in the United States\nare observed in all months of the year, an\nearlier calendar-day start to the season of high\nactivity is emerging. In general, there is more\ninterannual variability, or volatility, in tornado\noccurrence (see also Elsner et al. 201542).43\nEvaluations of hail and (non-tornadic) thunderstorm wind reports have thus far been less\nrevealing. Although there is evidence of an\nincrease in the number of hail days per year,\nthe inherent uncertainty in reported hail size\nreduces the confidence in such a conclusion.44\n\nThunderstorm wind reports have proven to\nbe even less reliable, because, as compared to\ntornadoes and hail, there is less tangible visual\nevidence; thus, although the United States has\nlately experienced several significant thunderstorm wind events (sometimes referred to as\n\xe2\x80\x9cderechos\xe2\x80\x9d), the lack of studies that explore\nlong-term trends in wind events and the uncertainties in the historical data preclude any\nrobust assessment.\nIt is possible to bypass the use of reports\nby exploiting the fact that the temperature,\nhumidity, and wind in the larger vicinity\xe2\x80\x94\nor \xe2\x80\x9cenvironment\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94of a developing thunderstorm ultimately control the intensity,\nmorphology, and hazardous tendency of the\nstorm. Thus, the premise is that quantifications of the vertical profiles of temperature,\nhumidity, and wind can be used as a proxy for\nactual severe thunderstorm occurrence. In particular, a thresholded product of convective\navailable potential energy (CAPE) and vertical wind shear over a surface-to-6 km layer\n(S06) constitutes one widely used means of\n\n200\n180\n160\n140\n120\n100\n80\n60\n40\n20\n0\n\n10\n8\n6\n4\n2\n1955 1960 1965 1970 1975 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010\n\n0\n\nDays per Year\nwith more than 30 Tornadoes\n\nDays per Year\nwith at Least 1 Tornado\n\nAnnual Tornado Activity in the U.S. (1955\xe2\x80\x932013)\nAnnual Tornado Activity in the U.S. (1955\xe2\x80\x932013)\n\nFigure 9.3: Annual tornado activity in the United States over the period 1955\xe2\x80\x932013.

It has the disadvantage\nof assuming that a thunderstorm will necessarily form and then realize its environmental\npotential.\nUpon employing global climate models\n(GCMs) to evaluate CAPE and S06, a consistent finding among a growing number of\nproxy-based studies is a projected increase in\nthe frequency of severe thunderstorm environments in the United States over the mid- to\nlate 21st century.46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51 The most robust\nprojected increases in frequency are over the\nU.S. Midwest and southern Great Plains,\nduring March-April-May (MAM).46 Based on\nthe increased frequency of very high CAPE,\nincreases in storm intensity are also projected\nover this same period (see also Del Genio et al.\n200752).\nKey limitations of the environmental proxy\napproach are being addressed through the applications of high-resolution dynamical downscaling, wherein sufficiently fine model grids\nare used so that individual thunderstorms\nare explicitly resolved, rather than implicitly\nrepresented (as through environmental proxies). The individually modeled thunderstorms\ncan then be quantified and assessed in terms\nof severity.53, 54, 55 The dynamical-downscaling results have thus far supported the basic\nfindings of the environmental proxy studies, particularly in terms of the seasons and\ngeographical regions projected to experience\nthe largest increases in severe thunderstorm\noccurrence.46\nThe computational expense of high-resolution\ndynamical downscaling makes it difficult to\ngenerate model ensembles over long time\n\nU.S. Global Change Research Program\n\nperiods, and thus to assess the uncertainty\nof the downscaled projections. Because these\ndynamical downscaling implementations focus on the statistics of storm occurrence rather\nthan on faithful representations of individual\nevents, they have generally been unconcerned\nwith specific extreme convective events in\nhistory. So, for example, such downscaling\ndoes not address whether the intensity of an\nevent like the Joplin, Missouri, tornado of May\n22, 2011, would be amplified under projected\nfuture climates. Recently, the \xe2\x80\x9cpseudo-global\nwarming\xe2\x80\x9d (PGW) methodology (see Sch\xc3\xa4r\net al. 199656), which is a variant of dynamical\ndownscaling, has been adapted to address\nthese and related questions. As an example,\nwhen the parent \xe2\x80\x9csupercell\xe2\x80\x9d of select historical\ntornado events forms under the climate conditions projected during the late 21st century,\nit does not evolve into a benign, unorganized\nthunderstorm but instead maintains its supercellular structure.57 As measured by updraft\nstrength, the intensity of these supercells\nunder PGW is relatively higher, although\nnot in proportion to the theoretical intensity\nbased on the projected higher levels of CAPE.\nThe adverse effects of enhanced precipitation\nloading under PGW has been offered as one\npossible explanation for such shortfalls in projected updraft strength.\n\n9.4 Winter Storms\nThe frequency of large snowfall years has\ndecreased in the southern United States\nand Pacific Northwest and increased in the\nnorthern United States (see Ch. 7: Precipitation Change). The winters of 2013/2014 and\n2014/2015 have contributed to this trend.\nThey were characterized by frequent storms\nand heavier-than-normal snowfalls in the\nMidwest and Northeast and drought in the\nwestern United States. These were related to\nblocking (a large-scale pressure pattern with\nlittle or no movement) of the wintertime circulation in the Pacific sector of the Northern\n\n264\n\nClimate Science Special Report\n\n9 | Extreme Storms\nHemisphere (e.g., Marinaro et al. 201558) that\nput the midwestern and northeastern United States in the primary winter storm track,\nwhile at the same time reducing the number\nof winter storms in California, causing severe\ndrought conditions.59 While some observational studies suggest a linkage between blocking\naffecting the U.S. climate and enhanced arctic\nwarming (arctic amplification), specifically for\nan increase in highly amplified jet stream patterns in winter over the United States,60 other\nstudies show mixed results.61, 62, 63 Therefore, a\ndefinitive understanding of the effects of arctic\namplification on midlatitude winter weather remains elusive. Other explanations have\nbeen offered for the weather patterns of recent\nwinters, such as anomalously strong Pacific\ntrade winds,64 but these have not been linked\nto anthropogenic forcing (e.g., Delworth et al.\n201565).\nAnalysis of storm tracks indicates that there\nhas been an increase in winter storm frequency and intensity since 1950, with a slight shift\nin tracks toward the poles.66, 67, 68 Current global climate models (CMIP5) do in fact predict\nan increase in extratropical cyclone (ETC) frequency over the eastern United States, including the most intense ETCs, under the higher\nscenario (RCP8.5).69 However, there are large\nmodel-to-model differences in the realism of\nETC simulations and in the projected changes.\nMoreover, projected ETC changes have large\nregional variations, including a decreased\ntotal frequency in the North Atlantic, further\nhighlighting the complexity of the response to\nclimate change.\n\nU.S. Global Change Research Program\n\n9.5 Atmospheric Rivers\nThe term \xe2\x80\x9catmospheric rivers\xe2\x80\x9d (ARs) refers\nto the relatively narrow streams of moisture\ntransport that often occur within and across\nmidlatitudes70 (Figure 9.4), in part because\nthey often transport as much water as in the\nAmazon River.71 While ARs occupy less than\n10% of the circumference of Earth at any given\ntime, they account for 90% of the poleward\nmoisture transport across midlatitudes (a\nmore complete discussion of precipitation\nvariability is found in Ch. 7: Precipitation\nChange). In many regions of the world, they\naccount for a substantial fraction of the precipitation,72 and thus water supply, often delivered in the form of an extreme weather and\nprecipitation event (Figure 9.4). For example,\nARs account for 30%\xe2\x80\x9340% of the typical snowpack in the Sierra Nevada mountains and\nannual precipitation in the U.S. West Coast\nstates73, 74\xe2\x80\x94an essential summertime source of\nwater for agriculture, consumption, and ecosystem health.

Used with permission.]\n\nGiven the important role that ARs play in the\nwater supply of the western United States and\ntheir role in weather and water extremes in the\nwest and occasionally other parts of the United States (e.g., Rutz et al. 201479), it is critical to\nexamine how climate change and the expected\nintensification of the global water cycle and\natmospheric transports (e.g., Held and Soden\n2006;80 Lavers et al. 201581) are projected to impact ARs (e.g., Dettinger and Ingram 201382).\n\nU.S. Global Change Research Program\n\nUnder climate change conditions, ARs may\nbe altered in a number of ways, namely their\nfrequency, intensity, duration, and locations.\nIn association with landfalling ARs, any of\nthese would be expected to result in impacts\non hazards and water supply given the discussion above. Assessments of ARs in climate\nchange projections for the United States have\nbeen undertaken for central California from\nCMIP3,73 and a number of studies have been\n\n266\n\nClimate Science Special Report\n\n9 | Extreme Storms\ndone for the West Coast of North America,83, 84,\n85, 86, 87\nand these studies have uniformly shown\nthat ARs are likely to become more frequent\nand intense in the future. For example, one recent study reveals a large increase of AR days\nalong the West Coast by the end of the 21st\ncentury under the higher scenario (RCP8.5),\nwith fractional increases between 50% and\n600%, depending on the seasons and landfall\nlocations.83 Results from these studies (and Lavers et al. 201388 for ARs impacting the United\nKingdom) show that these AR changes were\npredominantly driven by increasing atmospheric specific humidity, with little discernible change in the low-level winds. The higher\natmospheric water vapor content in a warmer\nclimate is to be expected because of an increase in saturation water vapor pressure with\nair temperature (Ch. 2: Physical Drivers of\nClimate Change). While the thermodynamic\neffect appears to dominate the climate change\nimpact on ARs, leading to projected increases\nin ARs, there is evidence for a dynamical effect\n(that is, location change) related to the projected poleward shift of the subtropical jet that\ndiminished the thermodynamic effect in the\nsouthern portion of the West Coast of North\nAmerica.83\n\nshow qualitatively similar projected increases\nwhile also providing evidence that the models represent AR frequency, transports, and\nspatial distributions relatively well compared\nto observations.84, 85 A caveat associated with\ndrawing conclusions from any given study or\ndifferences between two is that they typically\nuse different detection methodologies that\nare typically tailored to a regional setting (cf.\nGuan and Waliser 201572). Additional research\nis warranted to examine these storms from\na global perspective, with additional and\nmore in-depth, process-oriented diagnostics/\nmetrics. Stepping away from the sensitivities\nassociated with defining atmospheric rivers,\none study examined the intensification of the\nintegrated vapor transport (IVT), which is easily and unambiguously defined.81 That study\nfound that for the higher scenario (RCP8.5),\nmultimodel mean IVT and the IVT associated\nwith extremes above 95% percentile increase\nby 30%\xe2\x80\x9340% in the North Pacific. These results, along with the uniform findings of the\nstudies above examining projected changes\nin ARs for western North America and the\nUnited Kingdom, give high confidence that the\nfrequency of AR storms will increase in association with rising global temperatures.\n\nPresently, there is no clear consensus on\nwhether the consistently projected increases\nin AR frequency and intensity will translate\nto increased precipitation in California. This\nis mostly because previous studies did not\nexamine this explicitly and because the model\nresolution is poor and thus the topography is\npoorly represented, and the topography is a\nkey aspect of forcing the precipitation out of\nthe systems.89 The evidence for considerable\nincreases in the number and intensity of ARs\ndepends (as do all climate variability studies\nbased on dynamical models) on the model\nfidelity in representing ARs and their interactions with the global climate/circulation.\nAdditional confidence comes from studies that\n\nU.S. Global Change Research Program\n\n267\n\nClimate Science Special Report\n\n9 | Extreme Storms\n\nTRACEABLE ACCOUNTS\nKey Finding 1\nHuman activities have contributed substantially to observed ocean\xe2\x80\x93atmosphere variability in the Atlantic\nOcean (medium confidence), and these changes have\ncontributed to the observed upward trend in North Atlantic hurricane activity since the 1970s (medium confidence).\nDescription of evidence base\nThe Key Finding and supporting text summarizes extensive evidence documented in the climate science\nliterature and is similar to statements made in previous national (NCA3)90 and international91 assessments.\nData limitations are documented in Kossin et al.\xc2\xa020132\nand references therein.

Although\nthe range of estimates of natural versus anthropogenic\ncontributions in the literature is fairly broad, virtually all\nstudies identify a measurable, and generally substantial, anthropogenic influence. This does constitute a\nconsensus for human contribution to the increases in\ntropical cyclone activity since 1970.\nSummary sentence or paragraph that integrates\nthe above information\nThe key message and supporting text summarizes extensive evidence documented in the climate science\npeer-reviewed literature. The uncertainties and points\n\nU.S. Global Change Research Program\n\nof consensus that were described in the NCA3 and IPCC\nassessments have continued.\nKey Finding 2\nBoth theory and numerical modeling simulations generally indicate an increase in tropical cyclone (TC) intensity in a warmer world, and the models generally\nshow an increase in the number of very intense TCs. For\nAtlantic and eastern North Pacific hurricanes and western North Pacific typhoons, increases are projected in\nprecipitation rates (high confidence) and intensity (medium confidence). The frequency of the most intense of\nthese storms is projected to increase in the Atlantic and\nwestern North Pacific (low confidence) and in the eastern North Pacific (medium confidence).\nDescription of evidence base\nThe Key Finding and supporting text summarizes extensive evidence documented in the climate science\nliterature and is similar to statements made in previous national (NCA3)90 and international91 assessments.\nSince these assessments, more recent downscaling\nstudies have further supported these assessments\n(e.g., Knutson et al. 20159), though pointing out that\nthe changes (future increased intensity and tropical\ncyclone precipitation rates) may not occur in all ocean\nbasins.\nMajor uncertainties\nA key uncertainty remains in the lack of a supporting\ndetectable anthropogenic signal in the historical data\nto add further confidence to these projections. As such,\nconfidence in the projections is based on agreement\namong different modeling studies and physical understanding (for example, potential intensity theory\nfor tropical cyclone intensities and the expectation of\nstronger moisture convergence, and thus higher precipitation rates, in tropical cyclones in a warmer environment containing greater amounts of environmental\natmospheric moisture). Additional uncertainty stems\nfrom uncertainty in both the projected pattern and\nmagnitude of future sea surface temperatures.9\n\n268\n\nClimate Science Special Report\n\n9 | Extreme Storms\nAssessment of confidence based on evidence and\nagreement, including short description of nature\nof evidence and level of agreement\nConfidence is rated as high in tropical cyclone rainfall\nprojections and medium in intensity projections since\nthere are a number of publications supporting these\noverall conclusions, fairly well-established theory,\ngeneral consistency among different studies, varying\nmethods used in studies, and still a fairly strong consensus among studies. However, a limiting factor for\nconfidence in the results is the lack of a supporting detectable anthropogenic contribution in observed tropical cyclone data.\n\nregions that are currently prone to these hazards, but\nconfidence in the details of this projected increase is low.\n\nThere is low to medium confidence for increased occurrence of the most intense tropical cyclones for most\nocean basins, as there are relatively few formal studies\nthat focus on these changes, and the change in occurrence of such storms would be enhanced by increased\nintensities, but reduced by decreased overall frequency\nof tropical cyclones.\n\nThe third statement is based on projections from a\nwide range of climate models, including GCMs and\nRCMs, run over the past 10 years (e.g., see the review by\nBrooks 201392). The evidence is derived from an \xe2\x80\x9cenvironmental-proxy\xe2\x80\x9d approach, which herein means that\nsevere thunderstorm occurrence is related to the occurrence of two key environmental parameters: CAPE\nand vertical wind shear. A limitation of this approach is\nthe assumption that the thunderstorm will necessarily\nform and then realize its environmental potential. This\nassumption is indeed violated, albeit at levels that vary\nby region and season.\n\nSummary sentence or paragraph that integrates\nthe above information\nModels are generally in agreement that tropical cyclones will be more intense and have higher precipitation rates, at least in most ocean basins. Given the\nagreement between models and support of theory and\nmechanistic understanding, there is medium to high\nconfidence in the overall projection, although there is\nsome limitation on confidence levels due to the lack of\na supporting detectable anthropogenic contribution\nto tropical cyclone intensities or precipitation rates.\nKey Finding 3\nTornado activity in the United States has become more\nvariable, particularly over the 2000s, with a decrease in\nthe number of days per year with tornadoes and an increase in the number of tornadoes on these days (medium confidence). Confidence in past trends for hail and\nsevere thunderstorm winds, however, is low. Climate\nmodels consistently project environmental changes that\nwould putatively support an increase in the frequency\nand intensity of severe thunderstorms (a category that\ncombines tornadoes, hail, and winds), especially over\n\nU.S. Global Change Research Program\n\nDescription of evidence base\nEvidence for the first and second statement comes from\nthe U.S. database of tornado reports. There are well\nknown biases in this database, but application of an intensity threshold [greater than or equal to a rating of 1\non the (Enhanced) Fujita scale], and the quantification\nof tornado activity in terms of tornado days instead of\nraw numbers of reports are thought to reduce these biases. It is not known at this time whether the variability\nand trends are necessarily due to climate change.\n\nMajor uncertainties\nRegarding the first and second statements, there is still\nsome uncertainty in the database, even when the data\nare filtered. The major uncertainty in the third statement equates to the aforementioned limitation (that is,\nthe thunderstorm will necessarily form and then realize\nits environmental potential).\nAssessment of confidence based on evidence and\nagreement, including short description of nature\nof evidence and level of agreement\nMedium: That the variability in tornado activity has increased.\nMedium: That the severe-thunderstorm environmental\nconditions will change with a changing climate, but\nLow: on the precise (geographical and seasonal) realization of the environmental conditions as actual severe\nthunderstorms.\n\n269\n\nClimate Science Special Report\n\n9 | Extreme Storms\nSummary sentence or paragraph that integrates\nthe above information\nWith an established understanding of the data biases,\ncareful analysis provides useful information about past\nchanges in severe thunderstorm and tornado activity.\nThis information suggests that tornado variability has\nincreased in the 2000s, with a concurrent decrease in\nthe number of days per year experiencing tornadoes\nand an increase in the number of tornadoes on these\ndays. Similarly, the development of novel applications\nof climate models provides information about possible\nfuture severe storm and tornado activity, and although\nconfidence in these projections is low, they do suggest\nthat the projected environments are at least consistent\nwith environments that would putatively support an\nincrease in frequency and intensity of severe thunderstorms.\nKey Finding 4\nThere has been a trend toward earlier snowmelt and\na decrease in snowstorm frequency on the southern\nmargins of climatologically snowy areas (medium confidence). Winter storm tracks have shifted northward\nsince 1950 over the Northern Hemisphere (medium\nconfidence). Projections of winter storm frequency and\nintensity over the United States vary from increasing\nto decreasing depending on region, but model agreement is poor and confidence is low. Potential linkages\nbetween the frequency and intensity of severe winter\nstorms in the United States and accelerated warming in\nthe Arctic have been postulated, but they are complex,\nand, to some extent, contested, and confidence in the\nconnection is currently low.\nDescription of evidence base\nThe Key Finding and supporting text summarizes evidence documented in the climate science literature.\nEvidence for changes in winter storm track changes are\ndocumented in a small number of studies.67, 68 Future\nchanges are documented in one study,69 but there are\nlarge model-to-model differences. The effects of arctic\namplification on U.S. winter storms have been studied,\nbut the results are mixed,60, 61, 62, 63 leading to considerable uncertainties.\n\nU.S. Global Change Research Program\n\nMajor uncertainties\nKey remaining uncertainties relate to the sensitivity of\nobserved snow changes to the spatial distribution of\nobserving stations and to historical changes in station\nlocation and observing practices. There is conflicting\nevidence about the effects of arctic amplification on\nCONUS winter weather.\nAssessment of confidence based on evidence and\nagreement, including short description of nature\nof evidence and level of agreement\nThere is high confidence that warming has resulted in\nearlier snowmelt and decreased snowfall on the warm\nmargins of areas with consistent snowpack based on a\nnumber of observational studies. There is medium confidence that Northern Hemisphere storm tracks have\nshifted north based on a small number of studies. There\nis low confidence in future changes in winter storm frequency and intensity based on conflicting evidence\nfrom analysis of climate model simulations.\nSummary sentence or paragraph that integrates\nthe above information\nDecreases in snowfall on southern and low elevation\nmargins of currently climatologically snowy areas are\nlikely but winter storm frequency and intensity changes are uncertain.\nKey Finding 5\nThe frequency and severity of landfalling \xe2\x80\x9catmospheric\nrivers\xe2\x80\x9d on the U.S. West Coast (narrow streams of moisture that account for 30%\xe2\x80\x9340% of the typical snowpack\nand annual precipitation in the region and are associated with severe flooding events) will increase as a\nresult of increasing evaporation and resulting higher\natmospheric water vapor that occurs with increasing\ntemperature (medium confidence).\nDescription of evidence base\nThe Key Finding and supporting text summarizes evidence documented in the climate science literature.\nEvidence for the expectation of an increase in the frequency and severity of landfalling atmospheric rivers\non the U.S. West Coast comes from the CMIP-based\n\n270\n\nClimate Science Special Report\n\n9 | Extreme Storms\nclimate change projection studies of Dettinger et al.\n2011;73 Warner et al. 2015;87 Payne and Magnusdottir\n2015;85 Gao et al. 2015;83 Radi\xc4\x87 et al. 2015;86 and Hagos\net al. 2016.84 The close connection between atmospheric rivers and water availability and flooding is based\non the present-day observation studies of Guan et al.\n2010;74 Dettinger et al. 2011;73 Ralph et al. 2006;77 Neiman et al. 2011;76 Moore et al. 2012;75 and Dettinger\n2013.78\nMajor uncertainties\nA modest uncertainty remains in the lack of a supporting detectable anthropogenic signal in the historical\ndata to add further confidence to these projections.\nHowever, the overall increase in atmospheric rivers projected/expected is based to a very large degree on the\nvery high confidence that the atmospheric water vapor\nwill increase. Thus, increasing water vapor coupled with\nlittle projected change in wind structure/intensity still\nindicates increases in the frequency/intensity of atmospheric rivers. A modest uncertainty arises in quantifying the expected change at a regional level (for example, northern Oregon vs. southern Oregon) given that\nthere are some changes expected in the position of the\njet stream that might influence the degree of increase\nfor different locations along the West Coast.
