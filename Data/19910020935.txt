b'N91-30249\nLEO SPACE PLASMA INTERACTIONS\nDr. Dale C. Ferguson\nNASA Lewis Research Center\nCleveland,\n\nOhio\n\nPhotovoltaic arrays interact with the low Earth orbit (LEO) space plasma in two fundamentally different ways. One way is the steady collection of current from the plasma onto\nexposed conductors\nor semiconductors.\nThe relative currents collected by different parts of\nthe array will then determine the floating potential of the spacecraft.\nIn addition, these steady\nstate collected currents may lead to sputtering or heating of the array by the ions or electrons\ncollected, respectively.\nThe second type of interaction is a short timescale arc into the space\nplasma, which may deplete the array and/or spacecraft of stored charge, damage solar cells,\nand produce EMI. Such arcs only occur at high negative potentials relative to the space\nplasma potential, and depend on the steady state ion currents being collected.\nNew high\nvoltage solar arrays being incorporated\ninto advanced spacecraft and space platforms may be\nendangered\nby these plasma interactions.\nRecent advances in laboratory testing and current\ncollection modeling promise the capability of controlling, and perhaps even using, these space\nplasma interactions to enable design of reliable high voltage space power systems.\nSome of\nthe new results may have an impact on solar cell spacing and/or coverslide designs.\nPlanned\nspace flight experiments\nare necessary to confirm our models of high voltage solar array\nplasma interactions.\nFinally, computerized,\nintegrated plasma interactions design tools are\nbeing constructed\nto place plasma interactions models into the hands of the spacecraft\ndesigner.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nThe standard power source for space applications continues to be photovoltaic\narrays.\nStandard space arrays have used low voltages, such as 28 V, and have had minimal interactions with the ionized plasma of the earth\'s upper atmosphere.\nWith no exposed high\nvoltages, such systems will come to an equilibrium potential not far from the potential of the\nsurrounding\nplasma.\nHowever, with the advent of large space power systems, and the\nnecessity of large distributed areas for array photon collection, there has come a desire for\nhigh efficiency power transmission.\nTo electrical power system designers, this implies high\nvoltage systems, because the distribution losses go up as the square of the necessary\ncurrent.\nWith high voltage systems, the same amount of power may be distributed at lower\ncurrent levels, and concomitant\nhigher efficiencies.\nModern large solar array designs for high power space applications\ntypically use end-toend voltages of 160 to 200 V (eg. Space Station Freedom [SSF] and Advanced Photovoltaic\nSolar Array [APSA]).\nWith such high distributed voltages, some parts of the array must be at\nrelatively high potentials, with respect to the ambient plasma potential.\nGround tests and\ntheories concur that solar arrays at high potentials will interact with the surrounding\nplasma in\ntwo fundamentally\ndifferent ways. Firstly, they will collect steady currents from the plasma\nonto exposed conductors\n(such as cell interconnects)\nor semiconductors\n(such as cell edges).\n\n47-1\n\nThese currents will act as a drain on the power system, and for that reason are sometimes\ncalled parasitic currents. High potentials will pull in larger parasitic currents than the low\npotentials on solar arrays flown to date. The absence of a hard electrical ground in the space\nplasma will require that the power system, and solar arrays, will take on potentials (called\nfloating potentials) such that electron currents collected by the more positive parts of the\nsystem will be balanced by the ions collected by the negative areas. In general, only\nconnected electrical conductors must obey a "global" current balance condition. Insulators\nand isolated conductors exposed to the plasma will locally balance the electron and ion\ncurrents to their surfaces, resulting in a slightly negative surface potential. This potential is\nnecessary to repel enough of the fast-moving electrons to restrict the electron current to\nmatch the slow-moving ion current collected at small negative potentials.\nWhen applied globally to a space power system, the current balance condition requires\nthat for unimpeded electron and ion current collection, the entire system will float with about\n95% of its area negative, and about 5% positive of the plasma potential. For a 160 V solar\narray hooked to an insulated structure, this means that the most negative end of the array will\nbe at about 152 V negative of the plasma potential, and the positive end at only 8 V positive.\nHigh negative potentials relative to the surrounding plasma may lead to undesirable interactions, among them sputtering and arcing into the plasma.\nIf parts of the solar array are forced to be at high positive potentials relative to the\nsurrounding plasma, other undesirable effects may occur. At potentials above about 100 V\npositive of the plasma, solar cells and arrays may collect anomalously high currents, tantamount to the currents one might expect if the insulating surfaces were collecting current as\nwell as the conducting or semiconducting\nsurfaces. This effect is called "snapover", from the\nbelief that it is caused by the high surface potentials on the conductors\n"snapping over",\nbecause of secondary electron effects, onto the surfaces of the adjacent insulators.\nIt might\nlead to unacceptably\nhigh parasitic current power losses. One other possible undesirable\neffect might be localized heating due to snapover currents onto small exposed areas, which\ncould lead to pyrolysis of Kapton\xc2\xae surrounding the exposed conductor.\nion current collection by conducting surfaces at high negative potentials is implicated in\nthe second fundamental type of environmental\ninteractions.\nThe interaction of interest here is\narcing from surfaces to the space plasma (or to other spacecraft surfaces).\nThese transient\narcs may discharge the entire electrically connected surface of the spacecraft or array, and are\ntherefore potentially destructive of solar cells and/or array current traces. Solar array arcs into\nthe plasma occur where conductors\nor semiconductors\ncollecting ion current from the plasma\nare adjacent to insulating materials, such as coverslides or Kapton\xc2\xae. They are very short\n(microsecond)\nlocalized transients, emitting heat, radio frequency interference, light, and a very\ndense localized plasma, and causing a rapid positive swing of all spacecraft potentials.\nThere\nseems to be a threshold voltage for solar array plasma arcing, at around -230 V, although it\nmay vary with materials used.\nThe advantages of using high end-to-end voltages on space photovoltaic\npower systems\nmust be weighed against the risks of damage due to plasma interactions.\nThere exist\npossibilities of tailoring the system plasma interactions so that they may be ameliorated, or in\n\n47-2\n\nsome instances even used to control vehicle potentials.\nAn understanding of the phenomena is necessary in\norder to explore these possibilities.\n\nlO-_i\n\nDENSITY\n\n/\n\nc._\n\no\nI\n\nSTEADY STATE CURRENT COLLECTION\nFigures 1 and 2 show the current collection behavior of a typical solar array immersed in the space plasma, when its conductors (or semiconductors) are at a\npotential V relative to the plasma potential (Stevens and\nStillwell, 1989). It may be seen that for electron current\ncollection, there is a region of depressed plasma current collection for low potentials (less than about 100\nV). This is because the insulating surfaces which surround the exposed conductors have a slightly negative\npotential, to be able to locally repel fast-moving electrons to allow the slower ions to balance current locally.\nThese potentials, typically three to five times the plasma\n\nPLASMA_\nJ\n\nPLASMA\nCOUPLING\nCURRENT,\n\nA\n\n,L;\n\nYI\n\xc2\xb0-I // J\n,o-,.zjo:,,\nF\nt\nlo-e _\nt\n\nto\nPOSITIVE\n\nFigure\ntion\n\nT._\'_\n\n_r , I\n\n1.\n\nlo 2\n\nAPPLIEO\n\nlo3\n\nPOTENTfALS\n\nElectron\n\nCollec-\n\nelectron temperature\n(that is, 0.3 to 1.0 volts), extend into the region of space above the\nconductor,\nand may partially choke off the electron current to the conductor,\ndepending\non\nthe exact geometry.\nAbove about 100-200 V, there is a transition to anomalously\nhigh electron\ncurrent, corresponding\nto the snapover phenomenon\nmentioned in the introduction.\nHere, it\nalmost seems like the entire coverslide surface has become a conductor, for the purposes of\nelectron collection.\nAlthough there is disagreement\nabout the mechanism of the snapover\nphenomenon\n(Gabriel et al, 1983, Thiemann and Schunk, 1990), it may be due to charging of\nthe adjacent insulators by secondary electron emission, where emitted electrons hop across\nthe insulator until reaching the conducting surface, or perhaps by other surface conduction\nprocesses.\nBy way of contrast, notice the extremely small\nion collection currents at the same plasma densities\nand potentials negative of the plasma. Here the ion\ncollection currents appear to be approximately\nlinear\nwith voltage up to the voltage range where arcing\ntypically occurs.\nThe great differences in the size\nand effects of electron and ion currents is due primarily to the difference in the ion and electron mass,\nwhich is a factor of 1836 even for the lightest positive ion, hydrogen.\nIn low Earth orbit (LEO), most of\nthe ions are atomic oxygen, sixteen times more\nmassive still. Spacecraft speeds are typically much\nless than electron thermal speeds, so that the electrons are collected from all directions, at the thermal\nflux as modified by local potentials.\nHowever, the\npositive ions move much slower than the spacecraft,\n\n10-4\n\n10-6\nPLASMA\nCOUPLING\nCURREN_\n\nDISCHARGi_\n\nI) 2x\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2o\n\nA\n\n104\n\n;,\nI\nI\n\n10-9\n-I\n\n-I0\n\n-fO0\nAPPLIED\n\nFigure\n\n47-3\n\nPLASMA\nDENSITY\nCM-3\n\n10-5\n\n2.\n\nIon\n\nPOTENTIAL,\n\nCollection\n\n-1000\nV\n\nand so their flux is the ram flux, again modified by local potentials. Current collection in the\nwake of a large structure or array is complicated by the supersonic wake, depleted of ions,\nand also depleted of electrons by small space charge built up from the absence of ions.\nElectron and ion current densities may be orders of magnitude lower in spacecraft or array\nwakes than in the undisturbed plasma.\nBy balancing electron and ion currents collected by the entire structure and arrays, one\nmay determine the spacecraft floating potential. Simple models balancing the electron and ion\ncurrents to an array yield about a 95% negative floating fraction. It is reasonable, therefore, in\nthe absence of very large ion collecting areas on the spacecraft, to assume that the array\nfloats wholly negative, its most positive part at 0 volts relative to the plasma.\nThis will be\nmodified by vxB potentials due to the spacecraft motion through the ionosphere,\nand by\nchanges in the relative conducting areas for electron and ion current collection.\nHowever, it\ndoes show that for steady state conditions, a distributed voltage in contact with the space\nplasma will be more liable to ion-collection\nproblems than those due to electron collection.\nParamount under these problems are sputtering, dielectric breakdown,\nand arcing to or\nthrough the space plasma, i will treat dielectric breakdown and arcing to the space plasma in\nthe next section on transient events.\nSputtering is the physical removal of material from a surface by impact of incoming atoms\nor ions. Sputtered material may be redeposited on other surfaces, contaminating\nthose\nsurfaces with a thin film coating.\nSputtering at negative potentials starts occurring when\nexposed conductors\nare at the sputtering threshold below the plasma potential.\nFor most\nmaterials, this is between 10 and 30 volts. Sputtering yields are, however, small for energies\nless than about 100 electron volts, so sputtering only becomes a serious problem for negative\npotentials greater than this. Near holes in insulating coatings, the sputtering ions will be\nfocussed to fluxes perhaps 17 times their undisturbed flux, exacerbating the problem. See\nFigure 3 (courtesy of Joel Herr, Sverdrup Technology,\nInc.). All previous space power\nsystems have generated end-to-end voltages much less than about 100 volts, so sputtering\nwas not considered\nin their design. However, for Space Station Freedom, it has been\nestimated that sputtering may produce a loss of (or contamination\nof) about 0.4 mils of\nmaterial per year (Ferguson et al, 1990). Atomic oxygen protective coatings are typically much\nthinner than this, and one might expect that if they were sputtered (as, for instance near the\nedges of solar cells), their lifetime would be much less than one year. Even coatings as thick\nas 5 mils might be eroded away during the lifetime of SSF. Sputtering problems are especially\nsevere on rapidly switched components,\nbecause all of their insulating surfaces directly above\nconductors\nwill spend most of the time at very negative potentials, as the plasma ions find it\nimpossible to react quickly enough to neutralize the surfaces.\nSputter coating may be a\nparticularly difficult problem for solar cell coverslides, for their anti-reflective coatings may lose\ntheir efficiency if covered with transparent sputter effluent, or lose transparency\naltogether if\ncoated with an opaque sputter product.\nElectron collection problems are likely to become important only if the most negative end\nof the array is somehow elevated to a potential near the plasma potential.\nThis may occur on\nnegatively grounded arrays through thruster firings or other effluent dumps from the spacecraft, during arcs, or through purposeful increase of ion collection or decrease of electron\n47-4\n\n\'\n40_\n\n!\n\nt\nI\n\nI\n_,_\n\n__\'\n\n_-_\n\n3o-\n\n20i\n\n15-\n\n10-\n\n5-\n\nf\n\nO,\n\n0\n-40\n\n-30\n\n-20\n\n-10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\nradial distance\nJoel Herr, Sverdrup Technologies\nFigure\n\n3.\n\nIon\n\nPaths\n\nand\n\nEquipotentials\n\nNear\n\nan\n\nInsulation\n\nPinhole\n\ncurrent collection. These mechanisms may decrease the relative electron to ion collection\ncurrent ratio, and push the spacecraft potential more positive. It is estimated that under\nthruster firings on the negatively grounded SSF, the arrays may collect 10 amps of current or\nmore (Ferguson et al, 1990). This current drain will show up as a 1.6 kW parasitic loss in the\npower system.\nMore importantly, however, large temperature\nincreases may occur in thin\npower system traces, leading to pyrolysis (charring) of Kapton\xc2\xae or melting of copper or\naluminum (as recently found by T. Morton, Sverdrup Technology,\nInc.). This is only likely to\noccur if all of the following conditions are met:\n1. The current-carrying\ntrace is thin and covered with a poor heat conductor.\n2. A hole large enough to prevent current chokeoff (about 60 mils, Chock, LeRC) but small\nenough to collect high snapover currents exists in the insulator covering.\n3. The conductive trace is exposed to a high density LEO plasma in the ram direction.\n4. The trace is above + 100 V with respect to the LEO plasma.\n5. All above conditions obtain for several seconds (perhaps 10 seconds).\nKapton\xc2\xae pyrolysis was seen to occur on a test panel-pair of SSF arrays in a vacuum chamber\nat +450 volts (Felder, 1990). The charred area did not spread from the vicinity of the trace,\n\n47-5\n\n160\n6 rail Overhang\nI\n\n120"\n\n2\n\nLt.\n\nZ\n\n(5\n\nd\n\nLU\nZ\n\nFigure\n\n0 mil Overhang\n\n60A = 100 m**2\n.\n\n_;i\n\ni\n\n40 ........................ i......\ni...........................\n= 200 m**2\n\n20"\n100\n\n3.5 rail Overhang\n\n10000\n1000\nARRAY ELECTRON COLLECTING AREA (cm)**2\n\n100000\n\n4.

It has been found by modeling SSF array current collection with 3-D\ncomputer codes (NASCAP/LEO,\nR. Chock, LeRC) that the narrow spacing of the cells acts\nvery well to choke off electron current collection in ground tests, and is predicted to do so\nsomewhat under space conditions. Chock has shown that it may be possible to increase the\noverhangs of solar cell coverslides beyond the cell edges, and to decrease the gaps between\nsolar cells, to produce an array which collects electrons no more efficiently than ions, and\nthereby to significantly influence the floating potential behavior of large space arrays. Figure 4\nshows these results. The manufacturing\nfeasibility of these solutions is now being evaluated\nby major solar cell manufacturers.\nCaulking the gaps between cells, or painting the edges of\ncells, on the most positive segments of solar arrays may be alternative methods of decreasing\narray electron collection and producing a more 50%-50% distribution of array potentials.\n\n47 -6\n\nTRANSIENT\n\nEVENTS\n100\n\n-.\nP\n\nClassical\n\nsolar\n\narray\n\nma is well documented\n\narcing\nin both\n\nand space flight conditions\n1984, Grier, 1983).\nFigure\n1986)\n\nshows\n\nsporadic\nstandard\n\nto the plas-\n\nthe voltage\n\nground\n\nm\nD\nm\n\ntest\n\nm\n\n(eg.

Anodized aluminum surfaces\nhave been seen in ground tests to arc into the plasma at potentials as small as -80 V. While\nnot directly of concern to spacecraft solar array operations, large negative potentials on\nspacecraft may be the result of the spacecraft electrical power grounding scheme, the end-toend voltage on the arrays, and the relative electron and ion current collection characteristics\nof\nthe solar arrays. They may therefore be controlled by changing the array floating potentials\nthrough coverslide and gap specifications,\nas well as by a proper grounding scheme and\nproperly chosen coatings.\nArcs of all types seem to discharge the entire connected capacitance of the power system where they occur, and are therefore powerful current transfer\nevents.\nFigure 6 shows new laboratory results of arc strength versus connected capacitance\nin the\nsystem (Snyder, LeRC). For large capacitances, as on very large solar array panels or on\nlarge anodized spacecraft structure panels, peak arc currents may extend to thousands of\namps. The limiting mechanism for peak arc currents has not yet been found.\nIt is believed\n\nPeak Currents of Plasma Arcs\nBelt Flt Power:. 0.82+/-0.03\n1.0\xc2\xa3+04.\n\n0\n\n1.0E+0_\n\n1.0E+0_\n\n1.0\xc2\xa3+01\n\n1.0[+00\n\n1.0E-01J\n\n1.0E-02\n0.0001\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nI\n0.001\nSt_ler (Army)\nB,olmaln\n\n1\n\n\'\n\nI\n\n0.01\n\nI\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 P\n\n0.1\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\no\n\n\'\n\nI\n\n1\n10\n100\nCopocltonce (ur)\nSnyder (Slmulotlon)\n-4- Miller (Array)\nCorruth (Plate)\n-.-- Best Fit\n\nFigure 6.

(3"hat this statement\nhad to be made shows the extreme tendency for negative potentials to predominate).\nIt is\nbelieved that real arcing thresholds and valuable space data on other interactions will be\nobtained from this experiment.\nPASP + is an orbital experiment designed by the Geophysics Laboratory and funded by\nthe Department of Defense. It will look at arcing thresholds and radiation degradation on a\nvariety of solar array types (many of which are of interest mainly to the military). PASP + will\nbe placed in a highly elliptical polar orbit by a Pegasus launch vehicle, and has a desired\nlifetime of months to years. NASCAP/LEO modeling (Chock, LeRC) has shown that potentials\non PASP+ may be controlled by an electron emitter capable of emitting about 20 mA of\ncurrent. Power for the experiment will come from operating solar panels of a conventional\ntype. PASP + is expected to be launched near the end of 1992.\nThe High Voltage Solar Array experiment (HVSA) is a Japanese satellite, to be launched\nby a Japanese expendable launch vehicle. It will bias large solar arrays up to various high\npotentials with respect to the LEO plasma. It is unclear to this author what technique will be\nused to prevent the vehicle from charging to high negative potentials when the arrays are\nbiased positive. HVSA may fly in 1992.\nOther flight opportunities in the near future include SPEAR-3 (for Space Power Experiments Aboard Rockets), an SDIO experiment to investigate very high voltage interactions with\nspace power systems, but which will include some area for solar array tests, and possibly\nSEDS-2, an orbital experiment which may derive high voltages from an electrodynamic tether.\nAll of these flight experiments are important to give us more information on the behavior\nspace photovoltaic\nplasma interactions, so that our design ideas for preventing arcing and\ncontrolling spacecraft electrical potentials may be proven in the space environment.\n\nCOMPUTERIZED\n\nof\n\nDESIGN TOOLS\n\nAlong with the possibility of designing space power systems to interact compatibly\nwith, or\nto take advantage of, their space environment must come tools to enable the spacecraft and\nspace photovoltaic\ndesigners to benefit from this new knowledge.\nAt present, there are many\nlarge 3-D codes which allow detailed designs to be checked out in a computer-simulated\nspace environment.\nAmong these are NASCAP/LEO\n(a LEO charging and current collection\ncode, see Mandell et al, 1990), POLAR (a polar orbit ram/wake charging code), MOLFLUX (a\ncontamination\ncode), and others. However, these codes are more useful for checking out\ndetailed designs or exploring scientific concepts than for from-the-ground-up\nspacecraft\ndesign. In order to make engineering for spacecraft environmental\ninteractions easier, a new\ngeneration of codes is being developed, with adequate scientific approximations\nand real-time\noperation, to enable the designer to sit down at his PC and have a good design in a short\nperiod of time. The first of these codes, called EPSAT (for Environment Power System\nAnalysis Tool, see Jongeward et al, 1990), was funded by SDIO, and is now in beta testing. It\nruns in real-time on a high-end PC, and allows preliminary analysis and design tradeoffs for a\n\n47-10\n\nvariety of space plasma\nand system-produced\nenvironmental\ninteractions.\nIn EPSAT, space\nenvironmental\ninteractions\nof all major spacecraft\nsystems\nmay be considered\nin a self-consistent\n\nand\n\nintegrated\n\nway.\n\nA spinoff\n\nof EPSAT,\n\nis being funded\nby SSF, and is called\nthis and other codes will bring space\nof the experimental\nphotovoltaic\n\nstage\n\noriented\n\nmore\n\ntoward\n\nSSF than\n\nSDIO\n\nsystems,\n\nEnvironments\nWorkBench\n(EWB).\nIt is expected\nthat\nplasma and other space environmental\ninteractions\nout\n\nso that they\n\nmay\n\nbe considered\n\nby every\n\nspacecraft\n\nand space\n\ndesigner.\n\nREFERENCES\nFelder, M.C.
