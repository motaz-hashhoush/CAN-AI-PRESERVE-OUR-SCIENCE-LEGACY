Because the major fraction of the carbon in comets is in a mixture of complex organic molecules which earlier explained the 'missing' carbon mystery it is shown that substantial carbon depletions are impossible. The low C2 and CN production rates may be understood as consequences of Yanaka (1988r) being a new comet in combination with the small central area of coma observed. The surface of new comets resulting from cosmic-ray processing in the Oort cloud gives rise to dust which is relatively nonfragile and which remains relatively large and cool within the limits of a small diaphragm making the comet appear to be dust poor. This dust yields smaller abundances of carbon-rich species by evaporation than customary for the smaller and hotter fragmented particles further out in the coma.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "publications": [{"volume": "414", "submissionId": 19930071276, "issue": "1", "issn": "0004-637X", "id": "36ad6ff6249b4316bec06ec60159cb5d", "publicationName": "Astrophysical Journal, Part 2 - Letters", "publicationDate": "1993-09-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
