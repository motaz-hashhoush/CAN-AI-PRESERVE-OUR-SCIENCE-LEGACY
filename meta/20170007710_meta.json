Even getting started can be a monumental task. To solve this problem, NASAs Core Flight System (cFS), NASA's 42 spacecraft dynamics simulator, and Ball Aerospaces COSMOS ground system have been integrated together into a kit called OpenSatKit that provides a complete and open source software solution for starting a new satellite mission. Users can have a working system with flight software, dynamics simulation, and a ground command and control system up and running within hours.Every satellite mission requires three primary categories of software to function. The first is Flight Software (FSW) which provides the onboard control of the satellites and its payload(s). NASA's cFS provides a great platform for developing this software. Second, while developing a satellite on earth, it is necessary to simulate the satellites orbit, attitude, and actuators, to ensure that the systems that control these aspects will work correctly in the real environment. NASAs 42 simulator provides these functionalities. Finally, the ground has to be able to communicate with the satellite, monitor its performance and health, and display its data. Additionally, test scripts have to be written to verify the system on the ground. Ball Aerospace's COSMOS command and control system provides this functionality. Once the OpenSatKit is up and running, the next step is to customize the platform and get it running on the end target. Starting from a fully working system makes porting the cFS from Linux to a users platform much easier. An example Raspberry Pi target is included in the kit so users can gain experience working with a low cost hardware target. All users can benefit from OpenSatKit but the greatest impact and benefits will be to SmallSat missions with constrained budgets and small software teams. This paper describes OpenSatKits system design, the steps necessary to run the system to target the Raspberry Pi, and future plans. OpenSatKit is a free fully functional spacecraft software system that we hope will greatly benefit the SmallSat community.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20170007710, "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Inst. of Aeronautics and Astronautics", "location": "Reston, VA, United States"}}, "meetingId": "3adce4f2fb3d4d0086238fa4c94bb321", "id": "4fb004e4cda84b3c8fb06c8f3e7f6a35"}, {"meta": {"organization": {"name": "Utah State Univ.", "location": "Logan, UT, United States"}}, "meetingId": "3adce4f2fb3d4d0086238fa4c94bb321", "id": "80492f08782848d7bb52af742cd707f9"}], "name": "Annual AIAA/USU Conference on Small Satellites", "location": "Logan, UT", "id": "3adce4f2fb3d4d0086238fa4c94bb321"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20170007710, "id": "ac29e7d9b65a409eb2ea7718d6fa47f6", "publicationDate": "2017-08-05T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20170007710.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20170007710/downloads/20170007710.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20170007710/downloads/20170007710.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20170007710/downloads/20170007710.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
