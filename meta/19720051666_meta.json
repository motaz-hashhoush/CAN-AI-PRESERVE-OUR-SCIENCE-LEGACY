A stochastic communication model is presented that can be treated with current results in estimation theory. Approximate algorithms are developed for the estimation problem that yield mathematically realizable receiver structures for the cases of AM, PC, and FM. The digital receivers yield performance characteristics that compare favorably with those of their analog counterparts.", "title": "Discrete-time demodulation of continuous-time signals.", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-06T17:28:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19720051666, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Kelly, C.
