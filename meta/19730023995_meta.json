Three stages are investigated: a theoretical description of transition is developed for a simple time dependent pendulum plus constant applied torque; the two body gravitational interaction is expanded and reduced to a one dimensional time independent Hamiltonion; and the model is applied to Saturn resonances. Although the theory proves successful in the Saturn case, it is less successful in the Tital-Hyperion case in providing a resonable time scale for the damping of the amplitude of liberation.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19730023995, "id": "fcd77d14d7564245b1cabffd0f5868e4", "publicationDate": "1973-08-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19730023995.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19730023995/downloads/19730023995.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19730023995/downloads/19730023995.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19730023995/downloads/19730023995.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
