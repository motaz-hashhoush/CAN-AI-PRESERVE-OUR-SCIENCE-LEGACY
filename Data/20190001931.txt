The \xef\xac\x82ight manifest has changed this mission from an SLS Block\n1B con\xef\xac\x81guration to the Block 1. Due to a smaller upper stage, launch vehicle performance is\nreduced on the Block 1 compared to the Block 1B, which precipitated some changes to the mission\npro\xef\xac\x81le. One such change is the loss of a 100 nautical mile circular parking orbit, which is below the\nmajor orbital debris bands in Low Earth Orbit (LEO). Instead, the Block 1 Core Stage must insert\nthe Interim Cryogenic Propulsion Stage (ICPS) into an elliptical orbit that will \xef\xac\x82y through MicroMeteoroid and Orbital Debris (MMOD) debris bands multiple times before inserting Orion into the\nHigh Earth Orbit (HEO). Orbital debris has increased signi\xef\xac\x81cantly since the Apollo Program, so it\nmust be considered for any crewed mission. This paper will evaluate placement of LEO & HEO\napogee, timing of Perigee Raise Maneuver (PRM), Orion vehicle checkout prior to Trans-Lunar\nInjection (TLI), abort performance, and the MMOD risk against the overall launch availability and\nconcept of operations to \xef\xac\x81nd an optimized mission design.\n\xe2\x88\x97\n\nAerospace Engineer, Guidance Navigation and Mission Design Branch, NASA, Marshall Space Flight Center, Huntsville,\nAL 35812\n\xe2\x80\xa0\nAerospace Engineer, Flight Mechanics and Trajectory Design Branch, NASA, Johnson Space Center, Houston, TX,\n77058\n\xe2\x80\xa1\nAerospace Engineer, XI4, Jacobs Technology, Johnson Space Center, Houston, TX, 77058\n\xc2\xa7\nAerospace Engineer,XI411, NASA, Johnson Space Center, Houston, TX, 77058\n\xc2\xb6\nAerospace Engineer, Flight Mechanics and Trajectory Design Branch, NASA, Johnson Space Center, Houston, TX,\n77058\nAerospace Engineer, Guidance Navigation and Mission Design Branch, Bevilacqua Research Corporation/Jacobs Space\nExploration Group, Marshall Space Flight Center, Huntsville, AL 35812\n\xe2\x88\x97\xe2\x88\x97\nAerospace Engineer, Systems Analysis Branch, Jacobs Space Exploration Group, Marshall Space Flight Center,\nHuntsville, AL 35812\n\xe2\x80\xa0\xe2\x80\xa0\nAerospace Engineer,GV111, NASA, Johnson Space Center, Houston, TX, 77058\n\xe2\x80\xa1\xe2\x80\xa1\nGN&C Engineer, Guidance Navigation and Mission Design Branch, Troy7/Jacobs Space Exploration Group, Marshall\nSpace Flight Center, Huntsville, AL 35812\n\n1\n\nThe mission design will utilize Copernicus (Ref. 1),an n-body trajectory optimization tool, developed and maintained at Johnson Space Center in Houston, TX.

The MMOD risk analysis will be done in the\nBUMPER 3 simulation with the appropriate MMOD databases. BUMPER calculates the number\nof failures in a deterministic fashion by computing the number of MMOD particles that exceed the\nballistic limits of the different components on ICPS.

EM-2 on SLS Block 1B\n\nEM-2 BLOCK 1B MISSION OVERVIEW\nFor the original EM-2 Block 1B mission, the Exploration Upper Stage (EUS) delivered the\nEUS/Co-Manifested Payload (CPL)/Orion stack to a 100 nmi Low Earth Orbit (LEO). The stack\nthen loitered suf\xef\xac\x81ciently long to perform preliminary checkouts of the Environmental Control and\nLife Support System (ECLSS) on Orion. After anywhere from 120 to 177 minutes in LEO, the EUS\nre-ignited, performing an Apogee Raise Burn (ARB) to place Orion onto a 24-hour High Earth Orbit (HEO). Shortly after the ARB, the EUS/CPL stack and Orion separated. After separation (and\napproximately 30 minutes after the end of the ARB), the EUS performed the TLI-1 burn, targeting\nthe EUS/CPL stack to a lunar \xef\xac\x82yby for heliocentric disposal. After TLI-1, CPL separated from the\nEUS and re-targeted to an independent lunar arrival target. After coasting approximately 1 revolution in the 24 hour HEO (after ARB), Orion performed its own TLI-2 burn near the perigee of\nthe 24-hour HEO, targeting an approximately 8-day (+/- 0.5 days) free return lunar \xef\xac\x82yby designed\nto return Orion back to a planned Earth Entry Iterface (EI) for a splashdown off the coast of San\nDiego, CA. The 24-hour HEO allowed for additional vehicle checkouts and provided for a low TLI2 (dV) performance requirement, while aligning the scheduled waking crew time with the major\n(TLI-2) burn and the lunar close approach and \xef\xac\x82yby. After TLI-2, placeholders are reserved for\n\n2\n\nOutbound Trajectory Correction (OTC) and Return Trajectory Correction (RTC) burns on both the\noutbound (pre-lunar encounter) and return (post-lunar encounter) free-return trajectory legs, respectively. This mission pro\xef\xac\x81le will be referred to as the \xe2\x80\x9cHybrid Free Return\xe2\x80\x9d mission. This pro\xef\xac\x81le was\ndetermined to be low risk to the Orion crew and was highly desired to remain as the \xef\xac\x82ight pro\xef\xac\x81le\ngiven the change in manifest to the Block 1 SLS con\xef\xac\x81guration. Figure 1 provides and illustrative\nannotated graphic overview of the Block 1B MTLI mission.\nEM-2 BLOCK 1 MISSION OVERVIEW\nWith delays to the Block 1B development schedule that threatened the EM-2 launch schedule,\na decision was made to use the ICPS for the \xef\xac\x81rst crewed mission. This change from a Block 1B\n(EUS upper stage) to Block 1 (ICPS upper stage) con\xef\xac\x81guration, resulted in a number of impacts that\ndictated a new EM-2 Block 1 mission design and associated analyses and performance sensitivity\nstudies to determine a preferred reference mission that would best support crew safety and mission\nsuccess.\n\nFigure 2. EM-2 on SLS Block 1\n\nThe starting mission pro\xef\xac\x81le for the trade study (Figure 2) depicts the EM-2 Block 1 mission. The\n\xef\xac\x81rst change was moving from the circular LEO utilized on the Block 1B to the same elliptical orbit\nused on EM-1, 975 x 22 nmi. After Core insertion, the ICPS/Orion stack coasts up to apogee where\nthe ICPS performs its \xef\xac\x81rst burn to raise perigee altitude to at least 100 nmi. The stack then coasts to\nnear the second perigee passage where the ICPS performs the ARB to the 24 hour HEO. From this\npoint on, the mission pro\xef\xac\x81le is very similar to the Block 1B EM-2 mission except that the CPL has\nbeen removed from the manifest due to performance constraints on the SLS Block 1. Instead, small\ncubesats may be included at a later date, if vehicle performance permits.\nThe ICPS performance limitations dictate a trajectory design similar to EM-1 (Ref. 5), along\nwith the elimination of a CPL. While the EM-2 Block 1 Orion spacecraft weighs more than the\nEM-1 Block 1 Orion, its nominal free return \xef\xac\x82yby mission requires less propellant than the EM-1\nmission which inserts and, subsequently, departs from a lunar Distant Retrograde Orbit (DRO) with\npowered lunar \xef\xac\x82ybys on both the outbound and inbound trajectories.\n\n3\n\nThe EM-2 Block 1B trajectory bene\xef\xac\x81ted from the EUS\xe2\x80\x99 capability to deliver an EUS/CPL/Orion\nstack to a 100 nmi circular phasing orbit, allowing it to select from both ascending and descending\nnode Earth departures, thus garnering more nominal (unconstrained) launch opportunities. The\nBlock 1 mission, with its more limited ICPS upper stage, takes advantage of the SLS Core Stage to\ndeliver the ICPS/Orion stack to an elliptical parking orbit. This aids the ICPS in placing Orion in a\n24-hour HEO and then performing TLI-1 to heliocentric disposal. Due to performance limitations,\nthe elliptical orbit only provides ascending node departures, resulting in a loss of about half of the\nlaunch opportunities compared to the 100 nmi circular orbit.\nThe HEO orbit does provide for a relatively low Orion TLI-2 performance requirement, leaving\nsigni\xef\xac\x81cant remaining propellant to be applied in the event of an abort. Positive abort options for the\ncrew are a top priority for this mission and much analysis to date and planned for the future will be\nbrought to bear on the mission design to ensure the best possible options for returning a crew safely\nback to Earth in the event of a required abort.\nEM-2 PARAMETRIC TRAJECTORY ANALYSIS\nPrior to starting the broader EM-2 trajectory design trade study, a set of parametric analyses were\nperformed in order to determine how sensitive payload performance is to various in-space trajectory\ndesign decisions. A large number of trajectory parameters were identi\xef\xac\x81ed and studied in this phase.\nThose which were deemed to have a signi\xef\xac\x81cant impact and were pursued further are described in\nmore detail in the following sections.\nEvery study described below was performed by modifying the baseline EM-2 mission pro\xef\xac\x81le\nto accommodate the parameter to be studied. Only one trajectory parameter was varied from the\nbaseline in each study. In this way, each study is independent from the other studies and provides\nperformance sensitivities with respect to only the parameter in question. Each study was a point\ncase, or set of point cases, run with a launch date of June 7, 2022.\nPerigee Raise Maneuver Timing\nThe PRM is the \xef\xac\x81rst major engine burn executed by the ICPS. Its purpose is to raise the perigee\nof the Core stage insertion orbit to an altitude of 100 nmi. The standard technique for executing\nsuch a maneuver would be to center the burn on the insertion orbit apogee. However, various\nconsiderations with the Orion power subsystem and MMOD risk drove the team to study executing\nthis maneuver earlier.\nThe team studied the impact to mission performance of placing the PRM at \xef\xac\x81xed durations 30\nseconds, 1 minute, 2 minutes, 5 minutes, and 10 minutes after Core stage separation. For a PRM at\napogee, the burn would occur approximately 43 minutes after Core stage separation.\nThe primary performance metric considered when evaluating the impact of the various PRM\ntiming options was the additional amount of propellant required for ICPS and Orion to complete the\nmission. Here, as in other parametric studies, results were provided relative to the EM-2 baseline\nmission, which placed the PRM maneuver at apogee. Results are shown in Figure 3.\nNot surprisingly, the amount of propellant ICPS must expend in order to complete the mission\nincreases signi\xef\xac\x81cantly as the timing of the maneuver shifts earlier. The impact to Orion is less\nsevere, which is expected, as the ICPS is still placing Orion into approximately the same pre-TLI\norbit in each case.\n\n4\n\nFigure 3. Impact of Propellant Usage for Various PRM Timings\n\nCore Stage Insertion Apogee\nAn analysis was performed to study the impact to payload performance of altering the Core stage\ninsertion orbit apogee altitude. The baseline EM-2 mission uses an insertion apogee altitude of 975\nnmi. Also studied was an insertion apogee altitude of 1200 nmi. No other parameter was varied\nfrom the baseline EM-2 mission. Not surprisingly, increasing the insertion apogee results in less\npropellant expenditure by ICPS by roughly 1400 lbm. However, the higher insertion apogee also\nrequires Core stage to burn over 8000 lbm of additional propellant, thereby leaving less remaining\non the Core stage. The Core State insertion apogee is synergistic with the intermediate orbit period\nas those are the two main dials to balance the performance margins across the mission pro\xef\xac\x81le.\nIntermediate Orbit Period\nAfter performing the PRM, the ICPS executes an ARB to place the Orion spacecraft into a highly\nelliptical intermediate orbit. This maneuver is executed near perigee and raises apogee signi\xef\xac\x81cantly.\nThe baseline EM-2 mission sets the period of the intermediate orbit to 24 hours. The analysis team\nwas interested in understanding how increasing the intermediate orbit period to 42 hours would impact mission performance. The 42 hour orbit was selected for study because it is the shortest orbit\nperiod after 24 hours in which the Orion crew could then nominally execute their Trans-Lunar Injection burn without interfering with other crew activities, such as the crew sleep period. Here, a greater\norbit period translates into a higher intermediate orbit apogee. Also note that a higher intermediate\norbit period (and therefore, apogee) implies that Orion will require less propellant to execute its\nTLI maneuver. As with other analyses, only the period of the intermediate orbit was varied in this\nstudy. No other parameter was varied from the baseline EM-2 mission. It is both interesting and\nsigni\xef\xac\x81cant to note here that the additional amount of ICPS propellant required to place Orion into\nthe intermediate orbit is only slightly higher (\xcb\x9c1500 lbm) than is gained by increasing the Core stage\ninsertion orbit apogee to 1200 nmi, as shown in the previous study. Coupled together, these two\nparameter changes imply that mission analysts can effectively maintain existing propellant margins\non ICPS while providing Orion with additional propellant margin. In effect, these two options (i.e.,\nraising Core stage insertion apogee altitude and increasing the intermediate orbit period) together\nmake use of both the Core state and ICPS capabilities to increase Orion propellant margin.\n\n5\n\nFirst Revolution Apogee Raise Burn\nIn the baseline EM-2 mission, the apogee raise burn (ARB) occurred on the second perigee pass\nof the mission. That is, after performing the PRM, ICPS coasts for more than one full orbit period\nbefore executing the ARB. However, multiple passes through apogee can non-trivially increase\nMMOD risk to the spacecraft. Therefore, it was of interest to the analysis team to understand\nhow executing the ARB on the \xef\xac\x81rst perigee pass would impact mission performance. Iniitally, the\nprimary constraint of the \xe2\x80\x9cFirst Rev ARB\xe2\x80\x9d case is that Orion requires a minimum of two hours\nafter the PRM completes and before the ARB starts in order to check out the spacecraft prior to\ninserting into the intermediate orbit. The only way to achieve a coast duration of this magnitude is\nto use the PRM maneuver to signi\xef\xac\x81cantly raise apogee while also achieving the required 100 nmi\nperigee altitude. Analysis showed that executing the PRM two minutes after Core stage separation\nand targeting a post-PRM apogee of 3140 mi would provide the required coast time, although at a\nfairly substantial impact to ICPS propellant usage at greater than 1700 lbm and a non trivial impact\nto Orion propellant usage at about 440 lbm.\nNOMINAL HYBRID FREE RETURN ON SLS BLOCK 1 MISSION SCANS\nFeeding off the parametric analysis, the EM-2 Block 1 nominal and abort performance analysis\nfocuses on mission availability for nominal missions and maximizing positive abort capability for\noff-nominal missions. The nominal performance assessment covered a scan duration of 1 year\nfrom June 7, 2022 through June 7, 2023. The scan design produces available mission epochs given\nvehicle performance capability and (preliminary) operations constraints such as: available ICPS and\nOrion translational propellant mass, mission propellant of\xef\xac\x82oading, EI to splashdown downrange\nlimits, solar eclipse duration limits, launch and landing lighting limits. These mission parameters\nand constraint limits are evaluated for variations in propellant of\xef\xac\x82oading, post-MECO orbit apogee\n(with some perigee variation), and pre-TLI-2 HEO duration to assess the bene\xef\xac\x81ts or impacts that\nvarying these parameters have on the nominal and abort capability.\nAs compared to the Block 1B con\xef\xac\x81guration, Block 1 scans re\xef\xac\x82ect a smaller population of available nominal missions, in a given year, than the Block 1B scans, due in large part to the greater\nperformance capability of the EUS (Block 1B) vs the ICPS (Block 1). The EUS capability allows it\nto complete the ascent phase culminating in a circular (e.g., 100x100nmi) LEO with enough capability to subsequently perform an ARB of the entire EUS/CPL/Orion stack to a selected HEO and\n(after separation of the EUS/CPL stack from Orion) a subsequent TLI to a lunar \xef\xac\x82yby with a targeted heliocentric disposal destination. The EUS capability allows mission opportunities with either\nan ascending or descending node Earth departure trajectory. In contrast, the reduced performance\nof the ICPS forces a heavier reliance on the SLS Core Stage to deliver the ICPS/Orion stack to a\nhigher energy, elliptical orbit (e.g., 975x22nmi to 1200x17nmi), which limits the available translunar trajectories to only the ascending nodes, as exhibited with the EM-1 mission design, which\nalso uses the ICPS. The loss of descending node Earth departure availability with the ICPS (Block\n1) accounts for reduced mission opportunities as compared to the more capable EUS (Block 1B)\ncon\xef\xac\x81guration. Mission Trades\nThe lesser performing ICPS necessitated a partial mission redesign and associated re-optimization\nof the trajectory(ies). The initial EM-2 Block 1 baseline mission design, based on the EM-1 crew\nstudy results, laid out the \xef\xac\x81rst candidate mission design. It included the following fundamental\ndesign parameters:\n\n6\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Orion Mass: Not to Exceed Mass Allocation\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Orion Prop Load: 300 lbs of\xef\xac\x82oad (meet mass target)\n\xe2\x80\xa2 ICPS Performance: Per EM1 TLI data\n\xe2\x80\xa2 LEO Orbit: 2 revolutions (revs) at 975x100 nmi altitude\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Orion Array Deploy: Pre-PRM\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Secondary Payload: As available (not included in initial assessments)\n\xe2\x80\xa2 HEO Period: 24 hours\nTable 1.

Performance trade studies provided mission availability with selected mission constraints for a number of\nmission design variations. This trade space (see Table 1) of 10 individual trajectory cases (9 identi\xef\xac\x81ed cases with 1 case possessing 2 sub-options) provided a relatively comprehensive examination\nof the combination of potential mission design parameters via a set of performance trade studies\nintended to determine the number of viable nominal missions for a given mission design. Through\nthe assessment of these \xe2\x80\x9cTraj. Case\xe2\x80\x9d mission candidates evolved a set of potential mission design\noptions (i.e., Options A-F). Trajectory case 5 was intentionally left out as it ended up \xe2\x80\x9dseeding\xe2\x80\x9d case\n6\xe2\x80\x99s LEO apogee target. Case 5 originally optimized the post-PRM apogee day to day, but issues with\nthe optimization and time constraints on the trade study forced the team to abandon this case and\nmove on to \xef\xac\x81xing the post-PRM apogee for case 6. Trajectory cases 3 and 6 were not selected for\nfurther re\xef\xac\x81nement, so they were not sent forward as options.\nVariations in selection mission parameters resulted in competing effects, bene\xef\xac\x81ting or impacting\ndifferent systems, thus making it a challenge to balance overall mission risk. An increase of the\nbaseline 975 nmi (Core stage) insertion apogee to 1,200 nmi provides improvement in mission\navailability through decreased demand on ICPS performance and the use of existing Core stage\nascent margin. The reduction of the time of execution of the PRM (from the baseline apogee passage\nto 2 or 10 minutes after Core stage MECO) results in an increase in LEO apogee and associated\n\n7\n\norbit period, which provides for a single rev in LEO prior to ICPS ARB. The increased orbit period\nprovides reduced exposure to the MMOD \xef\xac\x81eld (by reducing LEO from 2 revs to 1 rev) while still\nproviding suf\xef\xac\x81cient time for Orion operations checkout (e.g., solar array deploys in a stable orbit\nwith ample settling time to the next burn, a longer \xe2\x80\x9cquiescent\xe2\x80\x9d period for operations checkout).\nHowever, the early PRM also results in a decrease in mission availability due to ICPS performance\nimpact. The number of post-PRM revs (1 vs 2) prior to ARB start, while decreasing MMOD \xef\xac\x81eld\nexposure, also decreases LEO operations checkout time. That said, a success-oriented mission could\ntolerate durations greater than 60 minutes and the single rev cases produced durations longer than 60\nminutes. With regards to HEO size, expansion of the HEO period from 24 to 42 hours provides for\na signi\xef\xac\x81cant reduction in the Orion (TLI-2) propellant requirement, resulting in greater post-TLI-2\nOrion abort capability due to greater propellant reserves. The larger HEO based mission results in\nslightly more frequent mission opportunities.\nTrajectory Scan Methodology\nThe trade studies examined required the implementation of large trajectory scans. A one-year\nscan of nominal missions necessitated the use of (Python) scripting algorithms to manipulate the\ninput decks (idecks) of the trajectory optimization software (i.e., Copernicus). The scripts allow\ntrajectory analysts to automate the trajectory optimization process. However, though automated, the\nconvergence of the year\xe2\x80\x99s worth of trajectory cases will take a lot of computer time. A well-tuned\nmission ideck could still require a day or so of computer execution time for a nominal mission set.\nAfter convergence of the trade study cases, a data extraction process translates selected data (e.g.,\nmission epoch(s), vehicle and propellant mass data, mission phase durations, trajectory targets, orbit\nparameters, spacecraft thrust, burn propellant used, launch and landing lighting data, lunar transfer\ndata, solar eclipsing data, etc.) into a spreadsheet format for further assessment.\nPreliminary (orbit) parameter sensitivity studies help analysts to provide the trajectory optimization tool with settings that encourage good performance optimization. For example, previous studies\nshowed that an equally weighted multi-objective function for ICPS propellant requirement with the\nOrion propellant requirement provides good performance for Orion while allowing for a reasonably\ngood number of mission opportunities.\nThe construction of the ideck for a given mission design at a given launch epoch combines both\nthe SLS (ascent to LEO) and Orion (TLI-2 and beyond) contributions to the mission as an integrated\nmission. The Copernicus tool provides the platform for (mission opportunity) trades study scans.\nTo achieve an integrated mission design, the Copernicus ideck includes a \xe2\x80\x9cHypergrid\xe2\x80\x9d data set that\nre\xef\xac\x82ects ascent from launch to Core stage MECO and provides to the Copernicus simulation the\nCore stage MECO state and time as well as other items (e.g., deliverable ICPS and Orion mass,\nascent margin for the Core stage). Copernicus uses the Hypergrid data to perform an integrated\nascent/on-orbit trajectory optimization. Copernicus can interact with the Hypergrid as it optimizes\nthe integrated trajectory. For example, Copernicus may use ascent margin in the Core stage to\nincrease LEO apogee to reduce the propellant requirement on the ICPS or adjust the launch azimuth\nto maximize the duration of the launch window for a give mission day.\nNumerical trajectory optimization tools are notoriously sensitive to initial guesses for the problems they are working to optimize. A good initial trajectory \xe2\x80\x9cguess\xe2\x80\x9d will provide for better, faster\nconvergence to an optimal solution for the overall trajectory. For performance trade studies, the\ntrajectory scan setups use a \xe2\x80\x9ccontinuation method\xe2\x80\x9d whereby the event times and control parameter\n(optimization variables) values are shifted from a fully converged trajectory to one that is nearby\n\n8\n\nin time (thus in orbit geometry). If the time step from a converged trajectory to the next desired\ntrajectory epoch is suf\xef\xac\x81ciently small to keep a suf\xef\xac\x81ciently similar trajectory pro\xef\xac\x81le, then the optimizer will work the new problem to \xef\xac\x81nal converged optimization. The continuation method does\nprovide a way to keep updated idecks for the next epoch in succession (in a scan) suf\xef\xac\x81ciently well\nbehaved that the optimizer can drive the initial guess to a \xef\xac\x81nal converged, optimal result. However,\nit does require suf\xef\xac\x81ciently small enough jumps in epoch so as not to disturb the overall converged\ntrajectory shaping.\nOngoing work at Johnson Space Center focuses on an initial guess generator (IGG) that uses\nsemi-analytic orbit propagation algorithms to create a feasible trajectory at any given epoch. With\na working IGG, the analyst could select any epoch-to-epoch magnitude shift for trajectory scans.\nThis allows the analyst to focus on just the trajectories of interest without need to create less useful\ninterim trajectories to keep to a small enough epoch shift so as to maintain trajectory optimization\nconvergence.\nAfter completion of a trajectory scan and subsequent data extraction, the initially unrestricted\ntrajectory data can be \xef\xac\x81ltered to re\xef\xac\x82ect vehicle and/or operational constraints. The analyst can\ncompare and contrast the number of nominal mission opportunities in a (for example, one-year) trajectory scan for an unrestricted dataset to one with added mission and vehicle con\xef\xac\x81guration cutouts\n(e.g., ICPS usable propellant expended, Orion usable propellant expended, EI to splashdown downrange limits, eclipse duration exceedances, launch and/or landing lighting constraints, etc.). The\npost-processing of selected mission constraints allows the analyst to quickly assess the (mission\navailability) impact magnitude attributed to the various constraints.\nTrajectory Case Descriptions\nFour key factors were found to in\xef\xac\x82uence the results: insertion apogee, PRM timing, number\nof revolutions in LEO, and HEO period. Analyzing various combinations of the aforementioned\nfactors led to six viable options (A-F).\nAssumptions for the Mission Availability and Performance Analysis\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Orion has a maximum useable translational propellant mass.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 ICPS has a maximum useable translational propellant mass.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 ICPS performs a lunar \xef\xac\x82yby to heliocentric disposal, targeting a minimum C3 of 0.35 km2 /s2\n(with respect to the Earth-Moon barycenter) 10 days post Lunar Gravity Assist (LGA). The lunar\n\xef\xac\x82yby altitude is 260 km.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Orion spends approximately 1 revolution in HEO.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The Orion lunar free return \xef\xac\x82yby (from TLI-2 to EI) is approximately 8 days.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The Orion Main Engine (OME) is used for TLI-2.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The ICPS is used for the PRM, ARB, and TLI-1.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 All burns are modeled as \xef\xac\x81nite burns.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The objective function minimizes both Orion and ICPS propellant used. They are weighted\nevenly.\n\n9\n\nMission Availability and Performance Analysis\nMission availability, LEO coast time, abort return time, and MMOD risk were used to compare\nthe trajectory options. There are several vehicle checks that need to be performed while in LEO.\nThis check-out time has a minimum of 60 minutes and a desired check-out time of 120 minutes.\nMMOD risk is tied to LEO as well. The more revolutions in LEO, the higher the MMOD risk.\nFurthermore, the larger LEOs tend to have a lower MMOD risk. The timing of the PRM is linked\nto the size of the LEO. The earlier the PRM, the higher the LEO apogee altitude. PRM timing\nalso plays a role in Orion power generation. The sooner the PRM is executed after insertion, the\nsooner Orion can deploy the solar arrays. All of these need to be taken into consideration along with\nimpacts to mission availability and the abort space in order to select the best mission design.\nOption A had the highest mission availability of the cases examined. There were between 12-14\nfeasible launch opportunities per month. The feasible mission opportunities tend to be consecutive\ndays each month. The average coast time in LEO was 190 minutes, which was greater than the\ndesired LEO check-out time. This option has the PRM occurring approximately 45 minutes after\ninsertion, which is more stressing for Orion power generation. Additionally, the 24 hour HEO\ncauses Orion to use more propellant for TLI-2, which reduces the available propellant for aborts.\nFurther, the lower LEO apogee altitude along with spending two revolutions in LEO increases the\nMMOD risk.\nOption B was an attempt to provide Orion with more continuous checkout time in LEO by moving\nthe PRM earlier in the LEO coast, or 10 minutes after the ICPS separation from the Core stage,\nwhile still performing the ARB near the \xef\xac\x81rst perigee passage. Checkout time is reduced in LEO\nfrom Option A to 78 minutes on average, or a minimum of 64 minutes across the yearly scan. For\neach lunar month, the launch period was also reduced to 10-11 days. The aborts situation remained\nsimilar to Option A due to retaining the 24 hour HEO. However MMOD risk was somewhat reduced\ndue to reduction to 1 revolution in LEO.\nOption C had similar mission availability to options B and D, with between 10-11 feasible launch\nopportunities per lunar month. The average LEO coast time was 211 minutes, which meets the\ndesired LEO check-out time. For this option, the PRM was completed 10 minutes after insertion,\nwhich allows for the Orion solar arrays to be deployed early in LEO. Option-C used a HEO period of\n42 hours. The larger HEO reduces the amount of propellant Orion uses for TLI-2, which increases\nthe available abort propellant. Furthermore, like option-A, the stack spends two revolutions in LEO.\nHowever, the LEO apogee altitude is higher than option-A, so the MMOD risk is reduced slightly.\nOptions C and D are identical, accept option-D spends only one revolution in LEO. The mission\navailability was the same as option-C, with 10-11 feasible launch opportunities per month. With\nonly doing one revolution in LEO, the average LEO check-out time was reduced to 81 minutes.\nThis LEO time falls between the minimum and the desired check-out times. Option-D has the same\nbene\xef\xac\x81t for Orion post-TLI-2 abort propellant available as option-C, since both use a 42 hour HEO\nperiod. In addition, the higher LEO apogee altitude along with spending only one revolution in LEO\nreduces the MMOD risk.\nOption E provided the lowest MMOD risk of any of the assessed options, however it also had\nthe lowest mission availability. The 24 hour HEO impacted the Orion abort capability in a similar\nmanner to Options A and B. This option was designed to meet the desired Orion checkout time of\n120 minutes, which is a result of the 3100 nmi apogee induced by the PRM at 2 minutes after Core\nseparation. The scan for this Option did not run as well as the scans for the other options, however\n\n10\n\nthe trade team realized that this option would not be palatable due to the low mission availability.\nThe results shown could have been improved on somewhat, but the team decided to work Option F\ninstead.\nOption F was a compromise between Options D and E in an attempt to get to a middle ground\non checkout time, while retaining the best of the previous two options. It resulted in a reduced\nmission availability from Option D, but improved the MMOD risk and Orion abort capability due to\nperforming the ARB on the \xef\xac\x81rst revolution in LEO and the 42 hour HEO period respectively. It also\nachieved a minimum of 90 minutes of checkout time in LEO, which was a compromise proposed\nby the Orion program.\nTable 2.

The coast time\nfor Option A represents the total time in LEO, including the coast to the PRM at apogee. The coast\nto apogee is approximately 45 minutes, so some Orion checkouts can be performed during that\ntime. All other options utilize an early PRM, so the coast time starts at the end of the PRM as 10\nminutes may not be suf\xef\xac\x81cient time to perform any checkouts. A \xef\xac\x81nal scan was run on Option D to\ncloseout the trade and resulted in slightly better numbers than Option C on launch availability. The\nanalysts expect that with further re\xef\xac\x81nement, Option C would end up being very close to Option D\nwith respect to launch availability.\nORION ABORTS ASSESSMENT\nAn analysis of the abort space was performed for three phases of the mission: LEO, HEO, and\npost-TLI-2 to lunar \xef\xac\x82yby. The general abort return time constraint is 6 days from abort declaration\nto splashdown, which allows 24 hours to develop an abort plan. This leaves a maximum return time\nof 5 days, which was the target for this analysis. The driver for this return time would be a cabin\ndepressurization where the astronauts would be required to stay in their suits. Too much time in a\nspacesuit can lead to medical issues (e.g. sepsis), so it is important for the vehicle return to Earth as\nquickly as possible.\nAssumptions for the Abort Study\nThe following are the basic assumptions that apply to the abort analysis for all three phases of the\nmission:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Return time from abort declaration to entry interface was minimized. This time included an\n\n11\n\nOrion coast prior to performing the maneuver. For several cases, Orion coasted to a more optimal\nlocation for the abort maneuver causing an overall decrease in return time.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The OME was used for the abort maneuvers.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Orion was allowed to burn all available remaining propellant after removal of the 136 kg (300\nlbm) propellant of\xef\xac\x82oad, \xef\xac\x82ight performance reserve, Outbound/Return Trajectory Corrections, Orbit\nMaintenance, Attitude Control System, Worst 1 Fault Tolerant Allocation, and Burn Time Integration.\nAssumptions for the HEO Abort Study\nThe following are the basic assumptions for the HEO abort study:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 A six month scan was conducted that ran from June \xe2\x80\x93 December 2022.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The aborts targeted the EI target line, which sets up Orion to splashdown off the coast of San\nDiego.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Two HEO periods were examined: 24 and 42 hour. The 24 hour HEO used a 975x100 nmi LEO\nand the 42 hour HEO used a 1200x100 nmi LEO.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Both cases stay in the HEO for approximately one revolution.\n24 hour HEO Aborts\n\nFigure 4. 24 hr HEO total return time vs. launch epoch. Shaded regions show\nunavailable epochs due to violation of the maximum allowable ICPS propellant limit.\n\nAborts to the target line were available for about half of each month (Fig. 4). There is a natural\nalignment between the non-available HEO aborts and otherwise unavailable epochs (due to violation\n\n12\n\nof the maximum allowable ICPS propellant limit). The abort return duration (abort declaration to\nEI) ranged from 0.151 \xe2\x80\x93 2.561 days, with a mean return time of 0.885 days.\n42 hour HEO Aborts\n\nFigure 5. 42 hr HEO total return time vs. launch epoch. Shaded regions show\nunavailable epochs due to violation of the maximum allowable ICPS propellant limit.\n\nAborts to the target line were available for every epoch throughout the 6 month scan (Fig. 5).\nThe epochs with the longest return times align with the unavailable epochs (due to violation of\nthe maximum allowable ICPS propellant limit). The abort return duration (abort declaration to EI)\nranged from 0.414 \xe2\x80\x93 2.315 days, with the mean return time of 1.244 days.\nAssumptions for the Post-TLI2 to Lunar Flyby Abort Study\nThe following are the basic assumptions for the post-TLI2 to lunar \xef\xac\x82yby abort study:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The aborts targeted the EI target line, which sets up Orion to splashdown off the coast of San\nDiego.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Post-TLI2 aborts for two HEO periods were examined: 24 and 42 hour. The 24 hour HEO used\na 975x100 nmi LEO and the 42 hour HEO used a 1200x100 nmi LEO.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Both cases stay in the HEO for approximately one revolution.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Both direct and lunar \xef\xac\x82yby returns were analyzed.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The feasible missions (missions that meet the ICPS propellant limit) of the worst performing\nmonth (least amount of post-TLI2 Orion propellant available) for 24 and 42 hour HEO scans were\nexamined. The worst month for the 24 hour HEO missions was May 2024. The worst month for the\n42 hour HEO missions was June 2024.\n\n13\n\n24 hour HEO Post-TLI2 Aborts\n\nFigure 6. 24 Hour HEO Post-TLI2 abort return time vs. abort declaration time from\nTLI-2. Worst performing day for Orion.\n\nThe maximum return times ranged from 6.14 days on the worst day to 4.77 days on the best day\nof the worst month. For the \xef\xac\x81rst 14 hours after TLI-2, a direct abort was the quickest option to\nreturn to Earth on the worst day for Orion performance (Fig 6). For the best day case (Fig 7), a\ndirect abort was the quickest return option for the \xef\xac\x81rst 26 hours after TLI-2. After that point, doing\na lunar \xef\xac\x82yby return was faster. The worst day of this scan shows that there are no returns under the\n5 day limit until approximately 40 hours after TLI-2.\n42 hour HEO Post-TLI2 Aborts\nThe maximum return times ranged from 5.44 days on the worst day to 4.52 days on the best day\nof the worst month. For the \xef\xac\x81rst approximately 36 hours after TLI-2, a direct abort was the quickest\noption to return to Earth on the worst day for Orion performance (Fig 8). For the best day case,\na direct abort was the quickest return option for the \xef\xac\x81rst 39 hours after TLI-2 (Fig. 9). After that\npoint, doing a lunar \xef\xac\x82yby return was faster. The worst day of this scan shows that there are no\nreturns under the 5 day limit for about a 10 hour block starting approximately 37 hours after TLI-2.\nMICROMETEROID AND ORBITAL DEBRIS ANALYSIS\nMMOD risk has increased steadily since the beginning of manned space ventures. The source of\nthis increase is the orbital debris portion of the risk. Figure 10 reveals the growing trend for tracked\norbital debris objects with sizes of 10 cm or greater. NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Orbital Debris Program Of\xef\xac\x81ce predicts\nthere are over 500,000 objects 1 cm and larger in Earth orbit\xe2\x80\x94a scale factor of over 30 compared to\ntrackable objects. The deliberate destruction of the Fengyun-1C Chinese weather satellite in 2007\n\n14\n\nFigure 7. 24 Hour HEO Post-TLI2 abort return time vs. abort declaration time from\nTLI-2. Best performing day for Orion.\n\nFigure 8. 42 hour HEO Post-TLI2 abort return time vs. abort declaration time from\nTLI-2. Worst performing day for Orion.\n\n15\n\nFigure 9. 42 hour HEO Post-TLI2 abort return time vs. abort declaration time from\nTLI-2. Best perfoming day for Orion.\n\nwas a major contributor, and the accidental collision of the Iridium 33 and Cosmos-2251 satellites\nin 2009 also boosted the current risk. With more than 2.5 million kilograms of objects now in Earth\norbit, such accidental collisions are projected to be a major source of orbital debris in the future.\nThe increased MMOD risk was investigated in 2015 for the EM-2 mission utilizing the Block\n1B con\xef\xac\x81guration of SLS. This study resulted in the recon\xef\xac\x81guring of the EM-2 mission pro\xef\xac\x81le into\na LEO apogee of 100 nautical miles (nmi) to remain under the main orbital debris bands until\nTLI. These regions of greatest orbital debris density are in the altitude range of 300 to 1000 nmi\nand cause the meteoroid in\xef\xac\x82uence to be very low by comparison. Unfortunately, the SLS Block\n1 con\xef\xac\x81guration with the ICPS does not have the performance to achieve this orbit pro\xef\xac\x81le. As a\nresult, the trade study described herein was executed to minimize MMOD risk while maintaining\nacceptable performance and other associated risks for the combined SLS and Orion system.\nThe MMOD risk was determined utilizing a model consisting of the Bumper 3 (Ref. 7) simulation code with the appropriate embedded elements of ballistic limit equations (BLE\xe2\x80\x99s) as well as\nthe ORDEM 3.0 orbital debris environment and the MEM r2 2.0.2.1 micrometeoroid environment\nrepresentations. This tool set, along with a \xef\xac\x81nite element representation of the ICPS and speci\xef\xac\x81ed\n\xef\xac\x82ight trajectory parameters, estimates the risk of a damaging strike due to micrometeoroids or orbital debris during \xef\xac\x82ight. Bumper calculates the number of failures in a deterministic fashion by\ncomputing the number of MMOD particles that exceed the ballistic limits for each element of the\nFinite Element Model (FEM), and calculates the total number of failures by summing the individual\nelements. An estimate of the probability of mission failure is determined from the total number\nof failures using Poisson statistics. The Bumper code has been the standard in use by NASA and\ncontractors to perform meteoroid/debris risk assessments since 1990. NASA Johnson Space Cen-\n\n16\n\nFigure 10. Number of Objects in LEO (greater than 10cm), 1956-2018 (Ref. 6)\n\nter (JSC) has applied BUMPER to risk assessments for Space Station, Shuttle, Mir, Extravehicular\nMobility Units (EMU) space suits, and other spacecraft (e.g. LDEF, Iridium, TDRS, and Hubble\nSpace Telescope).\nAn overarching assumption associated with the use of this model is that the ORDEM 3.0 and\nMEMR2 \xef\xac\x81les properly de\xef\xac\x81ne the debris and meteoroid environments, respectively. The validation\nof ORDEM 3.0, the driving environment to quantify MMOD risk for ICPS, is covered in section\n3 of Reference 8. MMOD modeling limitations are detailed for the Bumper code and the two\nenvironment \xef\xac\x81les within their respective supporting documentations. Section 2.3 of Reference 7\noutlines the limitations associated with the modeling of the MMOD strikes. Section 1.3 of Reference\n9 includes the limitations associated with the representation of the meteoroid environment while\nsection 1.2 of Reference 10 discusses the limitations with regard to the representation of the orbital\ndebris environment. But other assumptions which drive the accuracy of the assessments are related\nto the selected failure criteria for each component modeled. The following paragraph details the\nselection of the failure criteria for the ICPS systems\xe2\x80\x94the primary contributors to the overall system\nLoss of Mission (LOM) risk.\nHypervelocity impact testing at NASA\xe2\x80\x99s White Sands Test Facility (WSTF) provides the primary\nsource of failure criteria data. The results of these tests provide general insight as well as a source\nfor the tuning of damage estimate algorithms. For ICPS four pressurized containers were assumed to\ncontribute to MMOD strike risk: the LOX tank, the LH2 tank, the Helium tanks, and the Hydrazine\ntanks. The LOX, LH2 and Hydrazine tanks were modeled as metal tanks with a partial penetration\nfailure criteria based on testing which has shown that this level of penetration initializes spalling on\nthe interior surface of the tank wall. This spalling is assumed to either weaken the pressure vessel\nsuf\xef\xac\x81ciently to allow the propagation of cracks or to generate contaminating debris inside the tanks.\nEither of these conditions can lead to LOM. The Helium tanks are composite overwrapped pressure\nvessels (COPVs) with graphite-epoxy wrappings over a metal liner. Prior analyses assumed failure\ncriteria to be penetration to the outer surface of the liner. Validation testing of this assumption at\n\n17\n\nWSTF revealed that the tanks retained structural integrity and did not leak until the liner was also\npenetrated. So penetration through the COPV liner became the updated LOM failure criteria for\nthe ICPS COPVs. It should be noted that COPVs on ICPS are connected such that a leak in one\ntank will deplete the complete system. Assorted additional assumptions include the following. The\nengine nozzles were assumed to be relatively robust with regard to MMOD strikes, so they were not\nincluded as risk contributors. Also, the total exposed area of pressurized piping as well as avionics\nwas assumed negligible and therefore not modeled. The MMOD risk to Orion and the Service\nModule was assessed separately from ICPS, but with the same modeling approach. In both the\nOrion and SLS assessments, the structures of the neighboring systems were modeled as shielding.\n\nFigure 11. MMOD Analysis Results\n\nThe MMOD results for the various trades performed for the EM-2 study are detailed in Figure 11.\nThe ICPS risk covers the period between separation from Core stage and separation from Orion.\nThe Orion risk covers the entire EM-2 mission pro\xef\xac\x81le. As shown, the LOM risk is driven by the\nICPS risk, while the Loss of Crew (LOC) risk is largely determined by the Orion risk. The ICPS\nLOC risk is based on assuming that the service module can successfully abort Orion during a leak\nfrom the LOX, LH2 or hydrazine tanks. These risks are quanti\xef\xac\x81ed using an algorithm developed by\nSchonberg (Ref. 11) during an extensive review of tank burst testing. Schonberg\xe2\x80\x99s algorithm reveals\nthat tank pressure is a major driver in determining burst probabilities. The relatively low pressure\nlevels of these tanks result in very low burst risks. The helium COPV tanks are at high pressures,\nhowever, and testing has shown that resulting leak rates are suf\xef\xac\x81cient to exceed the ICPS reaction\ncontrol system. As a result, an MMOD strike suf\xef\xac\x81cient to cause leakage in a COPV is considered\nthe failure criteria for both LOC and LOM. The COPV testing also revealed, however, that the risk\nof COPV leaks were much lower than previously estimated. As a result, the LOC risks for COPV\nremained very low.\nAs previously detailed, the LOM failure criteria for the tanks other than the COPVs on ICPS\nare based on interior spalling. This criteria in conjunction with mission pro\xef\xac\x81les \xef\xac\x82ying through the\nmain debris regions resulted in estimates of unacceptable LOM risks. In particular, the Option\nA mission con\xef\xac\x81guration, which represents the baseline orbit previously established for an EM-2\nmission using a Block 1 con\xef\xac\x81guration, resulted in an estimated MMOD LOM risk of 1 in 185 and\nLOC risk of 1 in 868. This baseline orbit is a two orbit LEO with an apogee of 975 nmi and therefore\ntraverses the highest debris density bands for extended periods. Option B retains a relatively low\napogee (1200 nmi) but eliminates the second LEO revolution. This improved the MMOD risk to\n1 in 276 for LOM and 1 in 1,190 for LOC, but a reduction in check out time due to the single\norbit made this an unacceptable option. Option C represents an attempt to reduce the MMOD risk\nby extending the apogee to 1450 nmi, but since it retained the two revolution LEO for check out\npurposes, the risk estimates for LOM were back to unacceptable levels\xe2\x80\x941 in 194. As anticipated,\nthe two revolution LEO pro\xef\xac\x81les caused multiple passes through the high debris density regions\n\n18\n\nresulting in unacceptable LOM results. In an attempt to alleviate this impact, the remaining trades\neliminated the second revolution in LEO. Options E and F represent attempts to reduce MMOD\nfurther and extend check out times with highly elliptical orbits. The theory is that these orbits\nwould cause optimal orientations and reduced high density debris exposure times for the ICPS but\napproach the \xef\xac\x82ight times of the lower apogee two revolution missions. The results show that these\napproaches did reduce the LOM levels. The 1/447 LOM for the 3,100 nmi apogee was the best seen\nduring the trade. The launch availabilities were shown to be unacceptable, however, so Option D\nwas reviewed with a very good balance of MMOD risk with the other factors. This option, with an\napogee of 1450 nmi and a single revolution LEO, resulted in a LOM estimate of 1/374 and a LOC\nof 1,380. The LOC was the lowest crew risk in the study as a result of an optimal balance of ICPS\nLOM and Orion LOC factors.\nFINAL RECOMMENDATIONS AND OUTCOME\nThe trade study concluded that Option F was the best choice of mission design for EM-2, with\nOption D coming in a close second. These two options balanced the overall mission risk when\neverything was taken into account. Option F had the second best MMOD risk overall at the cost\nof lower launch availability. Option D had slightly higher MMOD risk compared to Option F, but\nhad greater mission availability. Ultimately, the Joint Integration Control Board (JICB) selected the\nOption D mission design for use in the EM-2 Mission Analysis Cycle (MAC) due to the higher\nmission availability. The JICB felt that the change in MMOD risk was not signi\xef\xac\x81cant enough\nbetween the two options to sacri\xef\xac\x81ce up to 3 days of mission availability per lunar month. The\ntrajectory analysis teams at Marshall Space Flight Center and Johnson Space Center have since\nproduced an initial reference trajectory for the SLS EM-2 MAC that will be used by both Orion and\nSLS to con\xef\xac\x81rm the mission design \xef\xac\x81ts within the capability of both vehicles.\n\nFigure 12.
