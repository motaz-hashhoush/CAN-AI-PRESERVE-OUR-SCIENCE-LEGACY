The software is a set of routines that, collectively, serve as a common software interface through which one can gain access to various parts of the hardware under test and/or cause the hardware to perform various functions. The routines can be used to construct tests to exercise, and verify the operation of, various processors and hardware interfaces. More specifically, the software can be used to gain access to memory, to execute timer delays, to configure interrupts, and configure processor cache, floating-point, and direct-memory-access units. The software is designed to be used on diverse NASA projects, and can be customized for use with different processors and interfaces. The routines are supported, regardless of the architecture of a processor that one seeks to diagnose. The present version of the software is configured for Coldfire processors on the Subsystem Data Node processor boards of the Solar Dynamics Observatory. There is also support for the software with respect to Mongoose V, RAD750, and PPC405 processors or their equivalents.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 20090011877, "id": "e6fd32dfa4714187aa43454d754e7883", "publicationName": "NASA Tech Briefs, August 2008", "publicationDate": "2008-08-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20090011877.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20090011877/downloads/20090011877.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20090011877/downloads/20090011877.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20090011877/downloads/20090011877.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
