Methods for comparing day-of-launch wind perturbation standard deviations with historical data at the launch site are described. A statistical model based on the Gumbel extreme value distribution is developed for the largest vector and component perturbations in a wind profile as a function of high-pass filter cutoff wavelength. Application of the model is proposed for assessing extreme perturbations within prelaunch sequential Jimsphere wind profiles.", "title": "Analysis of wind perturbation activity for the NSTS launches", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-14T10:05:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19900032816, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Adelfang, Stanley I."}, "organization": {"name": "Computer Sciences Corp.", "location": "Huntsville, AL, United States"}}, "id": "bd5a04abb8c64231a6f3344a36b2f72f"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19900032816, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Smith, Orvel E."}, "organization": {"name": "Computer Sciences Corp.", "location": "Huntsville, AL, United States"}}, "id": "88e1e18261cb4430a5a5d2a2a8c8c538"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-18T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19900032816, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19900032816, "id": "5c39eb06997e46679ca7f5301c594288", "publicationDate": "1990-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
