Mainguet, L. Canon, A.M. Chapelle and M.C. Chemin\n\nRegional Physical Geography Laboratory, University of Reims,\n\nReims, France\n\nThe studiesLccrriedut during the first year\n\nof the\n\n\nDGRST [General Delegation for Scientific and Technical Research]\n\nprogram entitled "The Struggle Against the Effects of Aridity,\n\nMaradi Experimental Unit" in particular have made it possible to\n\ndescribe the locale of this experimental unit in terms of its\n\ngeororphological and lithological environment.\nSahel region, the area is exclusively sandy.\n\nSituated in the\n\nThese studies\n\n\nrevealed how much the apparent monotony of forms conceals an\n\nextreme variety of nuances.\n\nThus the second year of this program had to be devoted first\n\nof all to solting the two major difficulties which were immediately\n\napparent: (1) providing a simple description of forms and then\n\n(2) developing a vocabulary.\n\nActually, even if the topography of thessandy structures of\n\nthe Sahel environment has been scantily described, no classifications\n\nor systematic studies of the origin and dynamics of these\n\nstructures have been made.\n\nThe structures of the Sahel Niger,\n\n\nwhich are the southernmost of the Paleosahara, were positioned\n\nduring the drtest phases of the current climate.\n\nThis suggests\n\n\nthat they represent only a transformation in time and space of\n\nactive sandy structures.\n\nThus we have been led to attempt: (1) a classification of\n\nactiwe dunes and (2) a definition, description and classification\n\nof sand structures covered with vegetation and fixed in place.\n\n\n*\n\nNumbers in the margin indicate pagination in the foreign text.\n\n1\n\nThis second part was the most difficulttto do because until\n\nnow no systematic vocabulary had been proposed. We thus had to\n\nmake up an entire vocabulary. We are not entirely satisfied with\n\nit, but it represents an initial attempt. To make things easiere\n\nfor our readers we have added a glossary of the terms used.\n\nTwo classification series were made, one of active dunes and\n\none of sandy structures covered with vegetation.\n\nare\n\nbased on 5idi s\n\ni\nf-r athe& la0st\n\nThese series\n\n\nyears on the terrain \xc2\xad\n\nin northern Chad, southern Algeria and a large part of the Niger\n\nRepublic; and on photographic and satellite studies of coverings\n\nof northern Chadcxthe Niger Republic and a large part of the\n\ncentral and western Sahara.\n\nAn initial geomorphological map of\n\n\nthe entire erg of Fachi Bilma, between the Tibesti and the\n\nTermit massif was made, followed by a second map covering the\n\nHaussa erg between the Termit massif and the Ader Doutchi massif\n\nand the western piedmont of the Air. The second map relates all\n\nthe decomposition parameters of the landscapes (eolian erosion,\n\nwater erosion, effects of human occupation) to empahsize the\n\nmechanisms of breaking up and reactivation of the sandy mantle.\n\nIt then seemed essential to try to quantify the climatological /3\n\nand especially anemometrical parameters of the severe drought\n\n\nlasting from 1969 to 1973.\n\nThergfore a ggaphic analysis of the climate of the Niger in\n\ngeneral was made. This includes (1) a standard graph of rainfall\n\naverages for 12 stations during the period 1931-1960, with -- for\n\ngreater precision -- a graph of comparative rainfall for the\n\noulbi basins of Tarka, N\'Kaba and Maradi from 1956 to 1969;\n\n(2) a graph of temperature:,averages for 10 station between 1951\n\nand 1970; and (3) a graph of relative himidity in % for\' 10\n\nstations between 1961 and 1970.\n\nA special place was reserved for the study of anemometric\n\n\ndata.\n\nThis is wh \'gwe took all the meteorological measurements\n\n\nconcerning winds between 1966 and 1975 for the main stations of\n\nthe Niger.\n\nThe following wind graphs were made:\n\n(i) graphs of the average\n\n\nof predominating winds for 5 stations between 1961 and 1970;\n\n(2) monthly wind direction charts which take into account the\n\ndirection (20 directions are distinguished), the speed and the\n\nfrequency.\n\nFor these same stations the 3average frequencies\n\n\nof the major winds were also studied.\n\nAn attempt was made to bring together the wind mapping data\n\nfor all of the Niger which revealed the main directions of the\n\nwinds.\n\nSince Maradi was the only complete weather station close to\n\nthe experimental unit, it was the object of a much more detailed\n\nstudy.\n\nThis study included the following:\n\n\ni. An annual rainfall graph comparing Maradi and Tarna for\n\nthe period 1932 to 1975.\n\n2. A monthly and annual rainfall graph for Maradi for the\n\nperiod 1960 to 1975.\n\n3. A graph of maximum and minimum monthly temperature averages\n\nbetween 1970 and 1975 in Maradi.\n\n\n4. A graph of monthly percentages of humidity from 1970 to\n\n1974.\n\n5. AAtable and climatological graphs for 1975 in Maradi\n\ncovering rainfall, temperature, potential evaporation and amount\n\nof solar heat.\n\n6. Charts of the average of ground winds in Maradi for the\n\nperiod 1951 to 1960.\n\nExcept for collecting the equantitative evidence of the\n\nclimatic crisis, the study of the winds was very rushed in order\n\n\n3\n\nto allow the positioning of wind breaks.\n\nAmong the other tasks we focoused on was the study of all the /i\n\ndesertification, i.e. the breaking up of landscapes by reactivation\n\nof the sandy mantle.\n\nMore than a frontal advance of the edge of the desert, we\n\nwere able to distinguish desertification caused by human factors;\n\nspot desertification due to over~pasturing (repeated visits to\n\nspecific sites) and linear desertification along trails.\n\nAs for desertification due to physical factors -- wind, water\n\nand the combination of the two -- its location does not\n\ncorrespond to parallels of latitude. In fact, decomposition due\n\nto the effects of water preceds eolian desertification in the\n\nnorth. But the experimental unit is located in a region where\n\nwe were able to show that the eolian factors are more dagerous\n\nthan the water factors, with eolian reactivation capable of\n\nreabhing isohyet 625 mm.\n\nThe dangers due to erosion by runoff\n\n\nthere are totally insignificant.\n\nThe research method used consisted of consulting three types\n\nof data: satellite pictures, a~rial photographs and the actual\n\nterrain.\n\nWe were thus assured that each set of data -- each with\n\n\nits own scale going from 1-1,000,000 with respect to the actual\n\nsize -- included its particular information, each set differiigrf\n\nfrom the ether but all of them complimentary.\n\nTo back up the ground observations aalarge number of\n\nspecimens was collected with three key ideas in mind:\n\n1. Diagnosis with an aim to paleoclimatic investigation~of\n\nthe mechanisms responsible for the positions of the sandy material.\n\n2. Stzldy of the size of particles which are moveable at the\n\npresent time in order to see to what extent the sands of the\n\n\nexperimental unit are capable of being put into motion.\n\n3. Localization of granulometric areas in order to determine\n\nthe best areas to emphasize.\n\nFor these last studies we had to extend very widely beyond the\n\nexperimental square because by studying the material of the square\n\nitself it was not possible to understand how it got there.\n\nThe final step included:\n\n1. A mapping study of the geomorphology of the Serkin Haoussa\n\nexperimental unitkt\n\nThe map that we made on a scale of 1:20,000 by means of\n\nphotographic coverage on a scale of i:lO 000, which was specially\nordered for this study, is a document which tries to show the\n\n\n/5\n\n\nshare of morphological processes and human factors which con\xc2\xad\ntribute to changes in surface behavior.\n\n2. A mapping study on a scale of 1:1,000,000 of various degrees\n\nof the breakup of sandy landscapes. The mapping information is\n\nbased on satellite pictures and aerial photographs. The map\n\ncovering the central Niger should makb it possible to show where\n\nthb experimental unit is situated in the scale measuring the\n\nThe map of the region extending to the\n\nsouth western foot of the Air was made with the help df Unesco.\n\n\ndegrees of break-up.\n\nto thank the persons and organizations who\n\nauthorized this work, who made it physically possible, who helped\n\nus accomplish it and those who participated in it:\n\nWe are happy\n\n- the authorities of the Niger Republic, in particular\n\nMr. Garba Zakary, Director General of the INRANA [National\n\nInstitute of Agronomic Research of Niger] at Niamey, the prefect\n\nof Maradi and Mr. Sidibe Ousseini in charge of INRAN at Maradi.\n\n- The DGRST [General Delegation for Scientific and Technical\n\nResearch] Which granted us all of the necessary loans.\n\n- The GERDAT [StuAt. and Research Group for the Development\n\nof Tropical Agronomy], in particular Messrs.

The douements used are the following, lised in order of dee\n\n6reasing scale: (1) National Geographic Institute photographs\n\n(1:50,000); (2) Landsat 1 satellite pictures (1:1,000,000, altitude\n\n920 km); (3) Gemini satellite pictures (1:1,000,000); (4) Pictures\n\nof the Noaa 3 satellite (1:8,000,000, altitude 1,500 km).\n\n\n28\n\n\nscale -- ends up with a more and more global view, on a continental\n\nscale, which combines not only the structures but the spaces\n\nbetween structures.\n\nThe progress thus made is to restorea value\n\n\nto the "empty spaces." i.e. to the spaces where the phenomena\n\nstudied are lacking (Tables I and II).\n\nAs for the dunes, specifying them according to their location,\n\nwe were led to consider them, by degrees, first of all with\n\nrespect to the other sandy structures of the ergs, then to\n\nreintegrate them into the entire erg and finally to observe\n\ntheir development in the Sahel.\n\nWhile discovering the interdependence of the ergs in the\n\n/8\n\n\nSahara, we were led to consider them in the context of three\n\ngreat major currentg of eolian transport which sweep across the\n\nSahara between 280301 N and 130 N to the east and 160 N to the\n\n\nwest.[ 5 ].\nThe large ergs of the Sahara are arranged according to two\n\npreferential latitudes, to the north of 28\'301 N and to the\n\nN,\nSouth of 23030 \' \n between which the Sahara is poor in sandy\n\ndeposits. With pictures taken by the Noaa 3 meteorological\n\nsatellites it is possible to study the relationships between the\n\ntwo bands and to demonstrate the existence of three main sand\xc2\xad\ncarrying eolian currents. The broadest of these is in the\n\neastern Sahara, another in the western Sahara and the third\n\nfollows the Atlantic coast line from 280 to 160 N then disappears\n\nin the ocean between 200 and 160 N.\n\nThe overall direction of the first two currents is NE-SW,\n\ncloselyfollowingthat of the trade wind. They lose their\n\nhomogeneity, however, and divide into several flows while their\n\ndirections bend. It is then impossible to speak of a trade\n\nwind with respect to currents which are deflected and divided by\n\n\n9\n\nobstacles (around Tibesti), indeed even turned back (north of the\n\nAir and south of the Kreb in Naga) until they become perpindicular\n\nto the initial direction (SW of the Tibesti) over more than\n\n100 km.\n\nAlong the currents alternate sections where sometimes trans\xc2\xad\nport and corrosion prevail, sometimes accumulation. Transport\n\nprevails when the current is divided by an obstacle and\n\naccelerated afeound the same, deposit occurs when, behind an\n\nobstacle, the two currents divided by the obstacle rejoin one\n\nanother then flow together and resume the initial direction of\n\nthe trade wind. Each branch is accompanied with specific eolian\n\nstructures and a precise mode of action.\n\nIn order to avoid any ambiguity we propose a definition of\n\nthe principle terms used: erg (an Arabic term) is synonymous\n\nwith adeyen in Libya, goz in the southern Sahara, koum in\n\ncentral Asia and nafud in Arabia.\n\nFor a sandy substrate either\n\n\ncovered or not with a deflation pavement the term specifies an\n\nextended concentration of sandy structures, either homogeneous\n\nin shape or not, united or juxtaposed according to the various\n\ndegrees of organization, without any apparent organization at the\n\nedge.\n\nIt is essential to note that an erg, the main area of a deposit,\n\nis always crossed over by several transport currents, which a\n\namounts to saying that even in an erg the sand circulates. It\n\ncirculates there slowly, but sand enters the erg from one side,\n\ns\nthe upstream -- ide, and exitssfrom the other side, the downstream\n\nside. This conclusively invalidates the hypothesis that ers are\n\nwithout exception a landscape modelled by the wind from a\n\nfluviatile sandy accumulation in a basin.\n\n\n10\n\nI.\n\nDistinction Between Eolian Sandy Structures in General, Dunes\n\n/9\n\n\nin Particular and Suface Conditions of Sandy Layers\n\n1.\n\nDunes\n\n\nIn our definition of dunes we adopt the minimum height of\n\n30 cm proposed by K.W. Glennie [ 3 ], adding that there must nece\n\nnecessarily be a certain minimum slope value.\n\nA dune, in the\n\n\nstrict sense of the term, possesses an active crest, directly\n\ndue to saltationa and slippage on the slopes and due to the\n\nmeeting of two slip faces or one deposit face and another slip\n\nface.\n\nThe dunes resulttfrom a deposit in which saltation is the\n\n\nprincipal mechanism: the sand of a dune has left the ground\n\nbefore alighting on it.\n\na: Depositydunes, mobile sandy bodies in relief, involve two\n\ndifferent families: (1) some resulting exclusively from a deposit;\n\nshield; (2) other resulting from deposit and slippage along the\n\nface under the effects of the wind: barchans for example.\n\nb: Erosion dunes (Australian sand ridge), stable sandy bodies,\n\nin the origin of whibh is involved a deflation action or even\n\nerosion in a sandy mass and which are often found in conjunction\n\nwith ergs in the process bf becoming established.\n\n2.\n\nSurface Conditions: Ripples, Ripple Marks, Megaripples\n\n\n(or Zibars in Arabia)\n\nMany classifications of eolian sand structures classify\n\nripples amoqggthe dunes, regarding them as small dunes. But there\n\nare megaripples the size of dunes which can be seen in aerial\n\nphotographs at a scale of 1:50,000, and the contour of some sandy\n\nsurface conditions rises as high as or above 30 cm, but the slope\n\nis so slight,\n\ndistributed overaa distance of 15-20 cm, that -it\n\n\nbecomes almost imperceptible.\n\nIn actuallity, it is thetr topo\xc2\xad\n\ngraphy and their dynamics which make it possible to distinguish\n\nthe surface donditions of dunes properly so called.\n\nIn effect,\n\n\nthe ripples do not have an active crest and are only a superficial\n\n\n11\n\nmodification whose reptation, creep or rolling, is the main\n\nmechanism of transport of the sand which does not become dethed\xc2\xad\nfrom the ground, either because the grains are too large or\n\nbecause the wind has to overcome a slope, for example on the\n\nwindward side of a dune.\n\nA distinction has been made between barchan ripples, whose\n\n/10\n\n\nconvex side faces the wind, and linguoid ripples whose convex\n\nside polhts in the direction of the wind []J].\n\nOur classification proposal is concerned only with dunes\n\n(deposit dunes and erosion dunes).\n\nThere will be no question of\n\n\nripples or of any other surface conditions.\n\nSince geomorphological research was originated, in particular,\n\nto distinguish between shapes and their functions, with regard to\n\neolian structures it has resulted in a classification based on\n\ntwo principles: (1) the stu g of an initial module and the various\n\nassembly levels; (2) the study of the dynamics of all forms\n\ntopographically defined for the first time.\n\nClassification of Sandy Structures\n\n\nII.\n\n1.\n\nDepositwDunes\n\n\nOur classification\n\nsystem is based on the simplest form\n\n\nmaking up the primary element. Complex dunes are only combinations\n\nof this primary element, and although they vary considerably,\n\nthey can be classified on the basis of the primary module, which\n\nin classical terminology is the seif dune.\n\nThe seif constitutes\n\n\nthe first order.\n\n,\n\n\'i)\n\nSeif Dune (Saber in Arabic): First Order Dune\n\n\nThe seif is an elongated dune tapered at its downstream\n\nend with a triangular frontal section whose pointed crest generally\n\n12\n\ndescribes an arc.\n\nLinear or multidirectional combinations of\n\n\nseifs give dunes of the second order.\n\nb) The Silk Dune or Linear Dune of the Second Order\n\n(wire in Arabic)\n\nThe silk dune as a whole is a straight string of sand,\n\nwith more or less sinuous features at the microlevel due to the\n\nhomogeneous justaposition of seifs along a unique direction. The\n\nsand in silk dunes behaves as alongside a railroad track which,\n\non a surface without any topographical irregularities, could\n\ntheoretically extend to infinity by the end-to-end addition of\n\nselfs.\n\nThe width of silk dunes hardly varies no matter how long\n\nthey are, and in any event is completely independent of this\n\nlength. This confirms that the silk is indeed a structure of the\n\nsecond order, resulting\n\nfrom the succession of a certain number\n\n\nof seif type modules, maintaining its scarcely variable width,\n\nwhile the length, with respect to width, can be as much as\n\n100 to 500 times greater.\n\nIn particular, the length can be\n\n\nsubject to large variations, since it i\n\nonly a function of the\n\n\nnumber of combined seif elements.\n\nThe longest silk of the Fachi Bilma erg (mission AE 56-57\n\nNE 33 XX, photograph numbers 202, 257-258, 266-267, Merguigara\n\nE. It is 40 km long, 50-100 m\n\nsheet) passes through 19020 \' \n\nwide at the upstream end, 50 m in the center and 30-50 m at the\n\ndownstream end.\n30-150 m.\nsystems,\n\nAverage silks are 2-3 km long for a width of\n\n\nSilks are sometimes arranged in stages, in elongated\n\nwhich can attain lengths of 30-40 km (in particular\n\n\nNE 33 XX and NE 33 XXI, corresponding to the Merguigara and Ehi\n\nDohou sheets). In these stages the silks succeed each other\n\nwith brief interuptions. Drift phenomena also appear from one\n\nslik\n\nto another (&erial photographs NE 33 XX nos. 381, 382, 383).\n\n\n13\n\nIn the Fachi Bilma erg all of the silks are in festoons,\n\nsometimes without any preferential orientation of the concavities,\n\nsometimes with distinct dominant directions of the concavities,\n\nand always close to two opposite directions, north or south.\n\nLikewise the systems without preferential orientation are in\n\nfact a mixture of north orientationzand south orientation. Note\n\nthat in the most common case in which the winds have been effected\n\nby going around the Tibesti in the north, the north orientations\n\ncorrespond to concavity pointing towards the wind and the south\n\norientations correspond to a concavity pointing downwind. Silks\n\nof different concavity are not adjacent, unless at the very head\n\nof the erg in the northern branch. Neither is there any\n\ndifferent opening of the festoons to the north and to the south\n\nof the erg. However, towards the west, there appears a distinct\n\ndominant direction of silks with the concavity directed towards\n\nthe north.\n\nThe elb is a particular type of silk. It sendssout barchans\n\nleeward of the dunes. This occurs when a silk appears on a rocky\n\nsubstrate and with the resulting annual average wind\n\nmakes a\n\n\nlarge angle of 30-45.\n\n-Barehan\n\nDihedrons and Barchans\n\n\nThese are a variant of the second order (Fig. 1) whose\n\nseifs are atranged symmetrically with respect to the axis of\n\nmigration of the structure. Topographically these are crescents\n\nwith the convex side pointing into the wind.\n\nFrom a study of the localization of dihedrons and barchans\n\n(on Landsat 1 pictures) emerges the following definition of their\n\ndynamics: mobile dunes as a whole, making up supplies of sand\n\nwhich are very moveable grain by grain, which shift more slowly\n\nthan the sand of the surrounding saltation mantle. Barchans are\n\n\n14\n\ndunes which exist only on a hard substrate, for\nsubstrate.\n\nThus\n\nexample a rocky\n\n\nthey are peculiar to transport regions and\n\n/12\n\n\nthe periphery of ergs.\n\nFor barchan shapes we propose the following subdivisions:\n\n1. barchan in the strict sense of the term, original structure\n\nof the second order\n\nbecause it is composed of two symmetrically\n\n\narranged seifs on both sides of its axis of migration.\n\n2. Pre-barchan states of the cake and shield type, simple\n\nconvexities of sand without active crests.\n\n3. Barchan dihedronq the result of a barchan notch on a\n\nconvex pile of sand.\n\nThus the barchan is a complex deposit dune on the windward\n\nside and a deflation and slippage dune on the leeward side. All\n\nthree mechanisms are responsible for its dynamic transport function.\n\nThus a place should beereserved in our classification for pre\xc2\xad\nbarchan stages which do not fit into the second order.\n\nd) Ghourd or Pyramid of the Third Order with Multi-\n\nDirectional Branches\n\nThe ghourd is in\n\nfact a dominant dune, often pyramidal,\n\n\nwhich sends out silks in any direction whatsoever.\n\nGhourds correspond to nodes in a system of staionary waves\n\non which the sand is built up at the expense of the bulges, which\n\ncorrespond to sahanes.\n\nIn the case of isolated silks, the seifs as a rule are flatly\n\narranged 6n a level sandy substrate, although they can climb\n\nover obstacles.\n\nThey constitute the only abrupt relief.\n\nIn the\n\n\ncase of ghourds the silkg diverge from the top of a sandy\n\npyramid and thus are arranged with a steep slope.\n\n\n15\n\nThe seifs which form the ghourds always describe a curve\n\nwhich is more pronounced than the curves of silks. It is this\n\ntrait, even more than the convergence towards the top of a\n\npyramid, which gives ghourds their special character.\n\nWhen two\n\n\ncurved branches meet this forms the "ghorafa" or ghourd cauldrons.\n\nWhen the pyramid disappears or even changes and the seifs, which\n\nare always curved, form a growing number of cauldrons, a\n\ntransition occurs towards the draa system, also e the third\n\norder.\n\nThis transition is probably reversible.\n\nAll the transition\n\n\nforms can be seen over short distances, although at the present\n\n\ntime it is not possible to say which one derives from another in\n\nspace or succeeds it in time, assuming there is a relationship\n\nbetween them.\n\nContrary to silks, for which there are innumerable models,\n\n\nthe ghourd is a complex dune but there is very little variation\n\nfrom one to another. Thus with regard to texture the variety is\n\nto be found especially in size differences. It is on the\nstructural level that the differences are very great; ghourds\n\nare actually either arranged in semi-circles or aligned in\n\nchains of ghourds, in the first case separated by open or closed\n\n(sahane) interdune spaces and, in the second case, by coridors,\n\nor gassi, and feidj, depending on whether they are sanded over or\n\nnot.\n\nThe classification of ghourds takes these arrangements into\n\naccount.\n\ne) Groups of Dunes of the Fourth Order (Photographs\n\n6 and 7)\n\nThird order dunes are arranged in linear groups or even\n\nmore extensive groups of areas of the same behavior, such as\n\ngroups of silks, semi-circular ghourds and ghourd chains which\n\n\n16\n\n\n/13\n\n\nfor the fourth order.\n\nHere we turn our attention to groups of\n\n\nthe fourth order composed of ghourds (Fig. 3).\n\nnature of the ghourd chains in the Fachi erg\n\nshows up over a len~ht of 200 km and a width of 2 km. They can\n\nbe marked out perfectly on the Landsat pictures at a scale of\n\nThe linear\n\nl:l,000,.000.\n\nThe feature common to the structures in this first part of\n\nour classification is the mobility of the sand.\n\nThe sand has maximum mobility in the regions where transport\n\nprevails, which are opposed to regions of dominant accumulation.\n\nIn the transport sectors the sand which is displaced most rapidly\n\nis that in the saltation mantles, followed by that which is\n\nstored in the barchans. In the accumulation sectors the sand is\n\nnot totally immobile.\n\nSaltation exists, but is is restricted by\n\n\nthe roughness itself of the sandy substrate and by its\n\nsculptured relief into various dunes, e.g. silks and ghourds.\n\nIn the case of ghourd chains, the wind, which is channeled\n\ninto the gassi, sweeps across them longitudinally and pulls the\n\nsand along the ghourds. Ghourd chainsformthe transition between\n\nmobile dunes and stable sandy structures.\n\n2. Regualar Dunes or Stable Sandy Structures\n\nStanding in opposition to the mobile dunes\n\nwhich we have\n\n\njust defined and classified, are the stable sandy structures.\n\nThese are the sand ridges of the Australian geographers which make\n\nup the principle ergs\n\nin Australia.\n\nThese stable structures are\n\n\neolian structures for which the term "dune" cannot be retained\n\nonly since their relief no longer results exclusively from\n\ndeposit but from a process of even wear, i.e. erosion.\n\n\n17\n\nThey\n\ncan be defined as extensive periodic sandy waves\n\n/15\n\nseparated by longitudinal or approxiamtely longitudinal valleys.\nEven if the eolian deposits are not longgitudinal because of the\ndrift phenomena which they undergo -- phenomena which are well\nstudied in conneetion with boat wakes -- the transport and eolian\n\nerosion are longitudinal.\nA classification of stable sandy eolian structures is not\n\nconceiveable without a study of the biochimatic environment in\n\n\nwhich they appear. We have already stressed the specific\n\ncharacter of barchans in the transport regions and the specific\n\n\n-\n\n-\n\nL----\n\n-\n\n-\n\ntv\n\nr\n\n,.:\n-.:-- ,.7, , .\n-\n\ne-r\n\n-.--\n\n-,\n\nT.4\n\n-- "U,--.

All of these dunes are characterized by the fact\n\nthat the sand is completely mobile.\n\nWhen the ergs are covered with vegetation, like those of\n\nthe southern region of the sahara which have become sahelian\n\nsince the last preneolithic dry phase ([illegible]), erosion forms\n\nare succeeded by deposit forms in time and space (towards the\n\nsouth).\nIn the mass of sand, which is covered with a more or\n\nless dense blanket of vegetation, the wind, armed with sand\n\nwhich it has picked up upstream in the area of active sand and\n\nwhich is the wave carrier, can carve out a system of periodic\n\nvalleys accentuated by water erosion.\n\n\n19\n\nIn contrast to mobile dunes, stabilized eolian sandy structures\n\nare characteristic of ers in the process of becoming extablished\n\nand are therefore forms which correspond to a very transient\n\nstage of incipient fixation of a sandy mass: that stage during\n\nwhich the deposited sand can no longer be moved by deflation but\n\ncan still be attacked by eolianlcorrasion. Thetool, thattis to\n\nsay the sand which is used by the wind to scui~lt the landscapes,\n\ncomes from upstream where it is still arid.\n\nHere too the\n\n\nexplanation demands a global view of the landscapes. The sectors\n\nshown in Figs. 3 and 4 succeed one another from NE to SW along\n\nthe path of the trade wind.\n\nIn many ergs transverse waves are adjacent to large longi\xc2\xad\ntudinal waves. There can even be landscapes with a checkered\n\nappearance, still perfectly visible in aerial photographs and\n\nsatellite pictures.\n\nThe former are due to a direct action of\n\n\nthe wind charged with sand and the latter are due to a cutting\n\naction whih gives the periodic alingments of the closed basins,\n\nsometimes covered with lacustrine deposits (Thar Desert, south\n\nof the Fachi Bilma erg), or continuous\n\ncorridors perpendicular\n\n\nto the wind which accentuatesthe transverse dunes resulting from\nwaves which the wind\n\ntakes charge of when it encounters\n\n\ntopographical obstacles.\n\nThese structures are studied with the\n\n\ndunes covered with vegetation.\n\nConclusion\n\nA step forward was made in the study of sandy landscapes by\n\ndistinguishing between the teiture and structure of sandy mantles.\n\nThe texture defines the parameters which make up the picture and\n\nth:\n\nstructure defines the organization of-these parameters.\n\n\nDepending on the scale of the ,documents studied, it is understood\n\nthat these two factors have differentymeanings.\n\n\n20\n\n\n/16\n\n\nThe spatial arrangement in an erg is not perceptible from the\n\nground.\n\nMan here is like an ant on a pile of sand.\n\nHe sees.the\n\n\nsand, the slopes and the primary modules up to the second order\n\nprovided that the assemblage and the distribution are not too\n\ndense nor the size too great.\n\nOrders 3, ! and 5 escape him\n\n\ncompletely.\n\nIn aerial photographs the third order (assemblage of silks.\n\nand barchans) can be perceived. The same for the fourth order,\n\nrepresented by chains of ghourds and areas covered with draa.\n\nOrders 5(ergs) and 6 (chains of ergs in a eolian current)\n\nare only within the reach of Landsat and Noaa 3 satellite pictures\n\n(Table III).\n\nThe aim of this work is to propose a classification of all\n\ncombinations, based on a simple form -- the seif -- and ending up\n\nwith compound forms which are grouped into two families, i.e.\n\nlinear families (silks) and multidirectional families (ghourds).\n\nWith this classification it is possible to assign an order to the\n\ndunes, as has been done for rivers.\n\nMobility, the fundamental parameter for any arrangement, has\n\nproved to be one of the effective criteria for classifying-dunes.\n\nIt is decreasing from the barchan to the self, to the silk and to\n\nthe ghourd and zero for erosion dunes which are smoothed out waves.\n\nIt is understood that, on the one hand, even in the barchan the\n\nsand is restrained and moves less quickly than in saltation mantles\n\nand that, on the other hand, each type of dune has an original\n\nfunction which corresponds to the prevailing context of accumulation\n\nor transport for which it is specific.\n\nFinally, in contrast to mobile dunes are stable eolian s\n\nstructures, the second large category in our classification which\n\n\n21\n\nis incomplete because we have only analyzed and classified the\n\nforms in the areas of active sand or those in the process of\n\nfixation.\n\nThe classification of eolian structures and of all the\n\n\ndegradation forms in the Sahel regions remains to be considered.\n\nChapter II.\n\nInventory of Sandy Structures on the Arid Borders\n\n/17\n\n\nof the Sahel\n\nThe Use of Photographic and Multdispectral Aerial Pictures for\n\nStudying the Active Ejtg of Fachi Bilma and Its Extension in the\n\nSahel, the Erg of Haussa.\n\nThe transition from an erg with active dunes to an\n\nerg\n\n\nwhose sandy structures are covered with vegetation was the\n\ncriterion that we used to define the border between thb Sahara\n\n)and the Sahel. Roughly it follows the southern Sahara (Niger,\n\nChad), isohyet 150 mm. 1\n\nBy analyzing Landsat 1 satellite pictures\n\n\nitias possible to determine, in a steppe with shrubs or trees,\n\nthe extension to the south of the Niger Republic and to Nigeria\n\nof a periodic topography in large waves, the origin of which is\n\npeculiar to active sandy areas.\n\nIt was also possible to\n\n\ndemarcate the quaternary wavering in the Sahara-Sahel border to\n\nthe south of the Sahara.\n\nOur reseaches have led us to propose, for the first time,\n\na classification of active eolian sandy structures [ 6 ]. Quite\n\nnaturally our interestshas been devoted to the study fof these\n\nsame structures blanketed either with steppe or savanna vegetation.\n\nThe sandy mantles currently covered by a continuous blanket\n\nof kvegetation consisting of graminaceous plants or trees were\n\npositioned during more intense dry phases than those which we\n\nknow today.\n\nTwo of these are known with certainty in the Niger\n\n\n1. According to P. Chamard, the limit of active groups in the\n\nsouthwestern Sahara corresponds to isohyet 50 mm.\n\n22\n\nRepublic: one before 2000 BP [expansion unknown] and the other\n\nat the Lower Holocene after 7,500 BP [ 2 ].\n\nP. Chamard places\n\n\nthe last rainy season of the Sahara between 10,000 and 3,500\n\nBP.\n\nDefinitions of Terms used\n\n/18\n\n\n- Covered dunes are sandy structures with a dense or open\n\nblanket of vegetation. Fozzilized [sic] by a blanket of vegetation,\n\nthe sandy structures lose their particular shape, in any case\n\ntheir ridge or peak angle and their specific dynamics.\n\n- Fixed dunes are eolian structures whose surface is paved\n\nwith coarse sandy particles which are too large to be moved by\n\nexisting winds.\n\nAround Termit in the Niger Republic these fixed\n\n\ndunes, i.e. stable with respect to eolian dynamics, are also\n\ncovered with vegetation.\n\n- A "transverse" wave is an elongated sandy eolian structure,\n\nrectilinear to slightly sinuous, with a convex profile, often\n\ndissymmetrical, sometimes with a flat\n\nsummit, most often organized\n\n\ninto a periodic Whole and whose direction is roughly perpefidicular\n\nto the dominant effective wind.\n\n- A "longitudinal" wave is an eolian structure which describes\n\na rectilinear linear path, with a convex profile, most often\n\norganized into a periodic Whole, likely to have a direction\n\nroughly equivalent to the dominant effective wind.\n\n- Reticulated waves are an assemblage resulting from the\n\ncris-crossing or superposition of the two above types of waves.\n\n- An eoloian sandy ensemble of periodic structure is a\n\nregular alternation of crests and corridors (extended interdune\n\n\n23\n\n\nhollow, sometimes the seat of ponds) following a preferential\n\norientation, sometimes longitudinal, sometimes transverse.\n\n- Monticular refers to a relief of small bulges of sand\nwith a convex profile separated by rounded hollows, arranged\nin semi-circles often following a regular network itside one\nand- the same region.\n\nWer are still not able to state with\n\ncertainty that these are eolian structures or if only the cap is\neolian.\n- Barchans and parabolas are isolated eolian structures,\n\nsometimes coalescent, but always clearly individualized, crescent\xc2\xad\nshaped with the convex side pointing to the wind wheh they are\n\nbarchans and with the concave side pointing into the wind when\n\nthey are parabolas.\n\nAt the time of their degradation when a\n\nhumid period is becoming established the barchans can give rise\n\nto perfectly conical rounded hills.\n\n\nSHilly \n\n\nrefers to nhills of sand which are slightly separate\n\n\nor coalescent.\n\nIn the Sahel environment or in any other semi\xc2\xad\n\narid tropical climatic environment involving a cover of vegetation\n\nthese hills result from the transformation of barchan type dunes.\n\nIn a study it is not possible to dissociate the Fachi Bilma\nerg from the Haussa erg because the latter is continuous with\n\nthe former in the Sahel region, which, by the way, confirms the<\n\ngranulomettic and morphoscopic studies.\n\nAt the start of our work we thought of limiting it to the\n\nstudy of the dynamics characterized by the different aspects of\n\nthe reactivation of the sandy cover and of dbflation.\n\nBut we\n\n\nhave been led to study the basis of these phenomena, i.e. the\n\ndifferent sandy accumulation relief which make up the local land\xc2\xad\nscape.\n\n24\n\n\nIn fact, two aspects of these accumulations surprised us:\n\n\n/19\n\n\n(1) the entire organization of the sandy cover and (2) the\n\ndiscovery of orginal shapes, covered sandy structures which it\n\nwas necessary to define and then classify.\n\nBy examining aerial photogrpahs wezwere able to map and\n\nlocalize these different structures, to detect the existence from\n\nnorth to southwest, i.e. from Termit to Maradi, fof a transition\n\nfrom\n\nstructures of an active erg to structures of a covered erg:\n\n\nfrom the well pronounced longitudinal and transverse structures\n\nof Termit to the indistinct monticular structure of Maradi,\n\npassing through the transverse monticular structure with the\n\nexistence of a distinct transverse structure around massifs.\n\nThus we can state that the Maradi and Tarka regions are\n\nalmost totally occupied by the slightly differentiated monticular\n\nstructure and we can note the presence of 4 other structures\n\nwhich occupy only a small percentage of the surface are.\n\nThree\n\n\nof them are not very extensive: the hilly structure, the trans\xc2\xad\nverse monticular sturcture and the longitudinal monticular\n\nstructure. The existence of the fourth structure, the longitudinal\n\nstructure, if it appears surpirsing, can be explained by the\n\nchannelization Gf one branch separated from the eolian current\n\nof the Fachi Bilma erg between the Damergou massif and th7e\n\nTegama Plateau.\n\nEach of these families of structures, depending on their,\n\ntopographical appearance, i.e. in particular their slope and the\n\ngrain size of the material of which they are composed, present\n\nvarious degrees of attraction and repulsion with respect to\n\nhuman occupation.\n\nWe also find that the region from Tanout to Zinder is\noccupied by, more differentiated monticular type structures -\xc2\xad\n\n/20\n\n\nlamost hilly -- and over smaller surface areas.\n\n\n25\n\n\nThe families of structures which occupy the\n\nlargest space\n\n\nin the region studied are the following:\n\n- separate dunes (barchans and6parabolas),\n\novoid dunes with\n\n\nclosed or open caoudeyres which indicatedthe progress of de\xc2\xad\ngradation in these structures and which can result in the hilly\n\nstructure due to coalescence, terminating with a transport\n\ncurrent, with\n\nbarchans blocked in their migration, fixed and\n\nthen degraded and regressing to the hill stage. This is proof\n\nof an abrupt incurision towards the north of a more hfmid climate.\n\n- The transverse monticular structures, which are very\n\nwidespread on the maps of Gamou and Zinder, indicate the presence\n\n-- during the transition from an active erg to a covered erg -\xc2\xad\nof a region covered by a dune structure very similar to the\n\nformation\n\nstage of the transverse structure.\n\n- The well pronounced transverse structure around the\n\n\nKoutous Massif and downwind of the Damergou Massif.\n\nThe progression which can be detected in the dune relief\n\nfrom Termit to Maradi is supported by a similar progression in\n\ngrain size and the shaping of grains of eolian origin. In fact,\n\nthe samples of sand at Termit include grains of all sizesbbetween\n\n160 and 800 Pm.\n\nAt Tanout selection has already taken place and\n\n\nthe coarsest sizes tend to disappear.\nIn Maradi the coarsest\n\ns\xc2\xb1zes have disappeared entirely.\nA selection process continues\n\nand only grains ranging in size from 160 to 315 pm exist in a\n\npreponderant manner.\n\nThe same is true for the surface conditions. The very\n\nblunted particles, iee. those whibh have undergone long eolian\n\ntransport, are distributed according to different sizes from\n\nTermit to Maradi. In Termit they still reach a size of 630 vm,\n\nin Tanout they are larger than 315 pm and at Maradi only 250 vim.\n\nThis progression in grain sizes caused us\n\n26\n\nto perceive the\n\n\nthe existence of a uniformity tying together these different\n\nregions; namely, the wind, the uniformity in the shaping of the\n\npaleorelief but even more\n\nthe dry paleoclimatic periods.\n\nThis\n\n\nwind is responsibe for transporting and sorting the material and\n\nits strength decreases along its dominant path.\n\nThis weakening\n\n\nof the wind prevented thb eolian transport of large particles\n\nto Maradi.\n\nThere is, however, a supply of coarse sand at\n\n\nMaradi which was carried by fluviatile transport.\n\nAn eolian current from the Tibesti region, which feeds the\n\n/21\n\n\nactive erg of Fachi Bilma and crosses the Termit massif .\n\npartially supplies our region with sand, shaping it with\n\ndecreasing force when our region was active.\n\nSimultaneously\n\n\nand in proportion with the deposit of grains of\n\nsand, from the\n\n\ncoarseststo the finest, it effected a load substitution and\n\ntook up autochthonous grains over the supply of sandstones ofthe\n\ncretaceous period.\n\nThus there is a triple action of the wind:\n\n\n(1) bringing in allochthon sand which is deposited selectively\n\naccording to its size; (2) load substitution, taking away the\n\nlocal decomposition material; and (3) shaping the topography of\n\nthe deposited sandy mantle. In the material deposited by this\n\neolian current is found\'afraction of particles which can be\n\npicked up again by existing winds.\n\nThe percentage of this\n\n\nfraction has increased due to the effects of soil genesis which\n\n\nthe sands have undergone.\n\nThe existence of deflation regions shaped like spearheads\n\nwhich can reach lengths of up to 200 km and which are more\n\nobvious in satellite pictures reinforces the assumption that an\n\neolian current is connected with the region whibh is capable of\n\ndepositing and shaping and also sweeping the deposited material.\n\nThis deflation action was particularly manifested during the active\n\nerg period, but it still continues to operate on a small scale\n\ntoday.\n\nThe connection between our regions and this old eolian\n\n\n27\n\ncurrent, whith was very active when the erg was active, can,\n\na priori, facilitate the resumption of eolian erosion in these\n\nregions. However, since nowadays our region is covered with\n\na blanket of vegation and fixed by a pavement of coarse material,\n\nthis resumption is normally not conceiveable without a disruption\n\nin the natural equilUibrium.\n\nThe gradual process described in these dune reliefs and in\n\nthe morphoscopy of the material making up these reliefs is found\n\nagain in the different aspects of current reactivation and de\xc2\xad\nflation.\n\nOn the maps of Gamou, East Zinder, Tanout and Zinder Magaria\n\nthere are many varied and distinct deflation and reactivation\n\nareas. Even if in places erg reactivation still takes on\n\nindistinct appearances, i.e. just beginning or still compensated\n\nfor by animal evacuations -- for example, around vilages -- we\n\noften find more distinct and pronounced reactivation in a linear\n\nshape or resembling a micro-crescent.\n\nThe maximum intensity of\n\n\nthe deflation is reached on the Gamou map.\n\nThere it appears\n\n\nin the form of shading and heavy marks alternating in successive\n\nwaves.\n\nOn the maps of Dakoro, Guidan Roumji,and Maradi and Tarka the /22\n\nsmall spots of deflation and reactivation blend together and in\n\nthe aerial photographs look like fuzzy ateas, "fuzzy features"\n\naccompanied by soft scratch marks.\n\nWhen we discovered these reactivation phenomena in the 1975\n\naerial photographs we refered back to the corresponding aeritl\n\nphotographs of 1957.\n\nAlthough the difference in scale made it\n\n\ndifficult to compare the two sets of photographs, we found thatt\n\nin the majority of cases, especially between 60 and 8\' of east\n\nlongitude, reactivation and deflation were practically nonexistent\n\nin 1957.\n\n\n28\n\nThe Sandy Structures in the Sahel Region\n\nII. \t\nA) General Characteristics\n\nThe Niger Republic (13-23\xc2\xb0N and 4-60E) :includes an -anid\n\nfringe in the north, becomes Sahelian in its interior and in the\n\nsouthern section\n\nbecomes Sudan-like.\n\nThe Sahel region maybbe\n\n\nbetween isohyets 150 mm (current limit of the active\n\ndunes) and 550 mm. The current reactivation processes extend\n\nto isohyet 625 mm.\n\nsituated\n\nIn the Sahel region of the Niger Republic the majority of\n\nthe surface area is covered with sand, an extension of the\n\nFachi Bilma erg. The active part of this erg describes and\n\nextensive right hand wake 800 km long and 300 km wide downstream.1\n\nIt begins at the southwestffoot of the Tibesti downwiftd of the\n\nmassif, between 190 and 20ON and 170 E, at the confluence of the\n\ntwo branches of the Harmattan which have flowed around it and\n\nalong which allochthon sand has been brought in in the form of\n\nbarchans or a saltation mantle. In the first stage of our work\n\nwe thought that the Fachi Bilma erg ended longitudinally in the\n\nwest next to Air. Studies of satellite pictures and grounid\n\nstudies revealed that it was more extensive, going beyond the\n\nexisting Sahara-Sah l border (161N) up to 121N and 60 E against\n\nthe eastern foot of the Ader Doutchi, which brings its total\n\nBut this is not a tight termination, since\n\nlength to 1?200 km.\na small ortion of sand still escapes more towards the west,\n\nsweeping across the Ader Doutchi, and towards the north between\n\nthe Ader Doutchi and the western edge of Air.\n\nGranulometric and morphoscopic studies\n\nof several hundred\n\n\nsamples of sand revealed that, upwind from the topographical\n\n\n1. Considering that an erg is an oriented structure having a\n\nbeginning and an end we speak of upstream and downstream.\n\n\n29\n\nnorth-south barrier formed by the A~r and Tanout massifs, it is\n\nthe coarsest grains which have the greatest roundness coefficient.\n\nDownwind from the same barrier the coarsest grains, on the other\n\nhand, have the smallest roundness coefficients.\nsmallest sandy particles which are the most used.\n\nThese are the\n\nThus in the\n\n\nTermit region the roundness ,coefficient increases proportionallyd\n\nwith the increase in grain size up to a maximum of 60 im and\n\nthen decreases.\n\nIn the Tanout region the roundness coefficient\n\n\nincrease no more than up to 315 inm. Finally in the Maradi region\n\nit increases up to the granulometic threshold of 250 Pm.\n\nThis means that the supply of coarse grains which appears\n\ndownwind from the Tanout massif is autochtonous, drawn from the\n\ndecomposition products of the sandstone substrate shot with\n\nquartz, and Cretaceous. And it means that only the small grains\n\nare allochtonous since theyeare rounded, the rrounded coarse\n\ngrains having been deposited\n\nupstream.\n\n\nThe dunes of the Sahel region, either fixed or covered, can\nclassified into three categories:\n\n1. Sturctures deposited in periodic systems.\n\nThese are\n\n\ncommon to the active erg regions of the arid zone and are covered\n\nin the Sahel.\n\n2. Structures organized into monticular or hillgstuctures.\n\nThey are found exclusively in the region of covered ergs.\n\n3. Individualized structures. These exist in both areas,\n\nbut differ in their topography. The individualized structures\n\nof the Sahel result from the degradation of those structures\n\nof the arid zone.\n\nB) Periodically Arranged Sandy Structures\n\n1. Transverse Waves\n\nWhen a current of sand-bearing air 6ncounters an\n\n\n30\n\n\n/24\n\n\nobstacle it begins to oscillate\n\nand produce waves.\n\nThe resulting\n\neolian structures reflect this phenomenon by their periodic\narrangement. These structures are called "transverse" with\nreference to the dominant effective winds. These have been\nstudied in the Niger Republic over a period of 10 years (from\nThese structures also exist in the active\n\n1966 to 1975).\n\nergs.\n\nThey form the majority of the surface area of tha downwind\nh\nhalf of the F~chi Bilma erg.\nNow the eolian currents which sweep the Sahel from the\nNiger Republic &ncountered upwind from this country in Chad, the\nTibesti massif, then, leaving the arid zone, ran into the\nThese are the two major obstacles, and in addition\n\nAir.\n\nthere\n\nare two smaller ones, those of Tanout and Koutous.\nThe transverse waves are present in the arid zones and Sahel\nzones, but in the fomer they are larger.\n\n/25\n\nIndeed, we have pointed\n\nout that in the active part of the Fachi Bilma erg their period \xc2\xad\nwas greater than in the Sahel, although we did not find an\nexplanation for this difference.\nThe transverse waves are one of the specific forms of the\nsouthern part of the Fachi Bilma erg southeof 17\'451N. This\nis why we have been led to speak of it with respect to stabilized\ndunes.\n\nThe 1:1,000,000 map (separate from the text) gives the\n\ndirections of these structures.\na) Transverse Waves of the Fachi Bilma Erg\nThe transverse waves cover an area of 4,500 km 2 , from\n11 0 25\'E-170 20\'N to 12 0 30\'E-17 0 45\'N.\nareas around\n11E-170 05\'N.\n1.\n\n13 0 E-170\n\nThey are found in smaller\n\n45\'N, around 11 0 35\'E-16 0 05\'N and around\n\nThere is a small isolated area around 10037\'E -\n\nAs on p. 29\n\n31\n\n16107\'N. Except in the area of 4,500 km 2 where they reach a\n\nlength of 30-40 km, the transverse waves are shorter than the\n\nlongitudinal waves, since their lengths vary from 5 to 20 km.\n\nAlthough the profile and altitude of transverse waves\n\nare\n\n\nnot as regular as those of longitudinal waves -- the crests too\n\nare more sinuous -- their overall directions are distinct and\n\nregular.\n\nThe large area of transverse waves already mentioned\n\nhas orientations which vary between 1530 and 1670 with a mean\n\nvalue of 163\', and sort of turns back in the direction of\n\n1700 to the north close to longitudinal waves.\n\nThe range in\n\n\ndirection of these waves is more extensive tlanhthat of longi\xc2\xad\ntudinal waves, since it spreads out over 450.\nThe values far\n\nfrom the mode are thoseeof short waves in small isolated areas,\n\nas if there existed a relationship between the length of the\n\nwaves and the regularity of their direction.\n\nTheir profile differs from that of longitudinal waves.\n\nIt\n\n\nis more often dissymmetric, the slope of the wupwind face being\n\nless than the slope of the downwind face. This asymmetry is more\n\n\nor less pronounced.\n\n(AO 55-56 NE 33 VII-VIII, no., 623-624,\n\nplate XVIII a and no. 740-741, plate XVIII b).\n\nThe waves are periodic and separated on an average by\n\na distance of 2,000 m. with small variations (1,500-3,000 m).\n\nb) Transverse Waves of the Haussa Erg\nIn the Haussa ere of the Nigerian Sahel, which today\n\nis covered with vegetation, the transverse waves are located\n\ndownwind from the Tanout massif, from 14019! to 14\'24N and from\n\n8\' to 8\'12\'E, and theyyare arranged like a sash around the\n\nKoutous Massif from 13050 \' to 14 0 30\'N and from 9035 \'\n to 10\'E\n\n(Fig. 5).\n\n32\n\n\nThe systematic location of this structure in the\n\n\n/26\n\n\nvicinity of massifs is remarkable.\n\nThe transverse waves are perpendicular to the direction of\n\nthe dominant dry season wind and have a north-northwest - south\xc2\xad\nst outhbast orientation. eFollowing a sinuous course and varying\n\nin length from 5 to 10 km and in width from 500 to 1000 m, they\n\n\npresent a dissemmetrical\n\nprofile, with the steepest slopes\n\n\ndownwind, and with interdune hollows which seem to be excessively\n\n\nhollowed out but are nevertheless sandy.\n\n\n,\n\nCM\n\nFig. 5.\nerg.\n\n\n\\\\\n\n%V\n\nIH\n\nLocation of the transverse dunes of the Haussa\n\n\n2.

Aerial photographs show their north\xc2\xad\n\n341\n\nci. \n\n\nnortheast - south-southwest orientation and the extent of the\n\ngassis which are much wider than the sandy structures which they\n\nseparate__ The sands which feed the erg certainly come from two\n\nsoruces: (1) some comes from the EfrRaoui erg which is in turn\n\nfed by inputs from the Saoura and the Great Eastern Ejig; (2) but\n\na large part comes across the Tademalt from barchans which abut\n\nobliquely onto the first wave of the erg.\n\nFrom one wave to the\n\n\nnext the sands move crosswise along the valleys, as indicated\n\nby the light cdr:isih stiaions. They also migrate on the\n\nlarge waves, along the peaks and especially along the silks.\n\nb) Location in the Fachi Bilma Erg\nThe longitudinal wave\naround\n\n190\n\n20124N and\n\n15 0 E,\n\n/28\n\n\nin the Niger Republic begins\n\n\ni.e. 20 east of the "cliff" of Bilma\n\n\nwhich cuts through the mtddle of the erg.\n\nDownwind from this\n\n\nescarpment these longitudinal waves form the southern part of\n\nthe Tner6erg while continuing up to 110 E.\n\nThis\n\nlarge area\n\n\nof longitudinal waves which extends over 40 is replaced in the\n\nsouth by a large reason of transverse waves.\n\nThese appear\n\n\naround 18 0 N and 130E, precisely in the region where the Bilma\n\n"cliff"obstaclp disajppars, and extends just to the right of\n\nthe Termit massif, up to 11 0 20\'E. Another bundle of longitudinal\n\nwaves to the south replaces the transverse waves. It begins\n\nat the same latitude as the transverse waves, follows a constant\n\neast-northeast - west-southwest direction, skirts the Termit Mas\xc2\xad\nsif and gradually dies out a little in front @f the Tanout Massif\n\nin the Sahel region. South of this second major longitudinal\n\nbundle of waves and in all of the southern portion of the Niger\n\nRepublic the longitudinal wave disapperared.\n\nCuriously it\n\n\nreappears in the Niger Republic downwind from Lake Chad in a\n\n1. The effect of the obstacle was described in M. Mainguet,\n\n1976, "Geodynamic Study of the Effect of a Topographic Obstacle in\n\nEolian Transport. Results Obtained Using Aerial and Satellite\n\nPictures of the Sahara," Bulletin \'de la Socigtg frahcaise de\n\n\nphotogramm6tric, No. 61, p. 31-38.\n\n\n35\n\nlatitude between Nguru (12 0 50\'N)cand Jamaari (1140\'N) and in a\n\nlongitude between Gumel (9\'30\'E) and Maigumeri (12\'50\'E).\n\n\nc) Description in the Fachi Bilma Erg.\n\nWe think that the giant waves are regularization dunes,\n\nwhich amounts to saying that the valleys separatin\n\nthem result\n\n\nfrom the effects of deflation in a region of extremely regular\n\nwind or have been amplified by the action of water during more\n\nhumid periods.\n\nThis explains why one could consider them\n\n\nlongitudinal because they are formed not only as a result of\n\naccumulation -- wMidh produced oblique or transverse forms -- but\n\nalso as a result of eolian sweepage or even erosion when the sand\n\nreacts like a solid rock with respect to the wind whena it is in\n\nthe process of being fixed by a pavement or covering of vegetation.\n\nd) Covered and Fixed Giant Waves of the Fachi Bilma Erg\n\n/29\n\n\nUpwind from the Termit Massif\n\nThese waves are covered with ripple marks.\n\nThe stability\n\n\nof their surface is due both to the vegetation which is found\n\nthere, but especialiy to the pavement of homogeneous, coarse\n\nparticles measuring up to 1,000-1,250\n\nm with a mode of 630-800 Pm.\n\n\nThese are "round-dull" grains which produce unimodil curves.\n\nOne\n\n\ncould say that the surface state of these dunes has been recorded.\n\nThe fixation of these waves was modified locally in February, 1976,\n\nby reactivation processes giving rise to:\n\n- nebkas behind the clusters of euphorbia,\n\n- craters at the foot of shrubs or small trees,\n\n- very curved silks clinging to rocky obstacles and the\n\nreappearance of an active peak on the waves.\n\n\nThe peaks of these giant waves are sprinkled with a large\n\nnumber of tools made of volcanic lava or sandstone highly\n\n\n36\n\nimpregnated with iron.\n\nThese tools lie on the surface or are\n\nburied to a depth of a few millimeters. Probably from a neolithic\n\nage, this specific location on the peaks of eolian structures\n\nprovides several pieces of information:\n\n- the interdune spaces were spared, probably because they\n\nwer flooded. This supports the assumption of a neolighic paleo\xc2\xad\nclimate more humid than the existing climate.\n\nA sample of charcoal taken west of the Berno dispensary\n\ngave an age measurement of 3,100 \xc2\xb1I00 BP.\n(The measurements\n\nwere made by Mrs. G. Delibrias of the Radiocarbon Laboratory\n\n.of the Atomic Energy Commission and of the National Center for\n\nScientific Research.)\nThis charcoal was found in a hearth\n\npearched on top of a dune. It appeared thanks to the action of\n\ndeflation and even erosion which in a local area on the top of the\n\ndune cleared away the covering of mobile sand which allowed the\n\noutcropping from the horizon of the slightly solidified red dune.\n\nThe hearth was included there, making up part of the solid mass,\n\nlooking like a round spot (40-50 cm in diameter) browner than\n\nthe rest of the slightly aggregated mass of the dune. This may\n\nindicate that the slight coehsion of the dune is neolithic. The\n\nsite of the hearth on top of the dunes alos implies flooded\n\ninterdune spaces, in contrast to the current situation.\n\n- Since the neolithic period the giant waves have evolved only\n\nslightly: the tools are actually all on the surface. Perhaps only\n\none winnowing has occured? It all looks as if the entire north\xc2\xad\neast\n\nsection was winnowed to the advantage of the southwest\n\n\nsection where it is all accumulating.\n\n- The traces of reactivation mentioned above are of the recent\n\nperiod or just before the recent period.\n\n\n37\n\ne) Longitudinal Waves in the Haussa Erg \n\n\n/30\n\nIn the covered region beginning downwind from the Termit\n\nMassif and ending at the foot of the Ader Doutchi the extent of\n\nthe\n\nongitudinal waves is limited.\n\nThey are located as follows: downwind from the Termit fTassif,\n\n\nfrom 15030 \' to 161N, and from 10030 \' \n to 11E; downind from the\n\nto 141N and from 8050 to 90 E;\n\nDamagaram iassif, from 13o50 \' \n\nfrom 150 to 160 N and from 60 to 70 E. Theyeare located in a channel\n\nformed by the Tegama Plateau to the north and the Damergou and\n\nAder Doutchi massifs to the south.\n\nCharacterized by a ENE-WSW right\n\nhand orientation, these\n\n\nlarge waves are 10-25\'kkm long and can reach a height of 20 m.\n\nTheir slopes are iliss steep than those of the same waves located\n\n\nin an active erg.\n\nThe side facing to the south east is more\n\n\nabrupt than the northwest face.\n\nf) Formation and Evolution Mechanisms\n\nThe dynamics which give these waves their longitudinal\n\ncharacter are bounded\n\nby the laws of ablation and transport\n\n\nwhich give rise to longitudinal forms and the laws of accumulation\n\nwhich give rise to oblique to transverse forms.\n\nThe two mechanisms, erosion and accumulation, act simultaneously,\n\none and the same wind causing both of them when the degree of\n\nfixation &f the erg causes this combination, which is also favored\n\nby\n\nthe small angle between the two vectors.\n\nAnalysis of photographs of the upwind portion of the Fachi\n\n\nBilma erg, where different stages in the evolution of the large\n\nwaves can be observed, suggests the following three kinetic stages:\n\n\n38\n\n1. Longitudinal wave systems in the process of\n\nbeing\n\n\nformed: the wind has a tendency to cut into the "-" regions,\n\nwhile the "+" regions are left relatively untou6hed.\n\n2. Silks deflecting to the right are established prefer\xc2\xad\nentially on the right hand slopes of the waves, probably because\n\nin the case of right hand de~lection the slope promotes their\n\ngrowth on this face.\n\nThis preferential position of silks then\n\n\ncauses an influx of sand into the valley, which causes the wind\n\nto sweep into (a) before continuing its cutting action, and at\n\nthe same time causes a narrowing of the valley which increases the\n\ncutting action on face fl of wave A, while the increase in cutting\n\naction on face f2 of wave B is compensated for by additions of\n\nsand from the silks on the right (Fig. 7).\n\n\nii\n\nti\n\nI/ \t\n\n[.13 On~uat,ons\nFig. 7.\nwaves.\n\nA\n\nEZCoulors B\n\nI\n\n\nr f6irccsen\'Ont C\n\nChanges in the direction of longitudinal\nKey: \t Waves\n\nA)\nB) Valleys\n\nC) Narrowing\n\n\n3.

In a context of active ers the sandy particles in the\n\nform of transverse waves are transported from bne ripple to another\n\nalong the shortest path then deposited along a right or left\n\n\n41\n\noblique line.\n\nLittle by little the transverse waves decompose,\n\n\nwhile hollows appear lined up from one ripple to another. These\n\nhollows, give rise to furrows. Between the furrows sand bridges\n\nare established from one ridge to another, giving rise to\n\nlongitudinal waves. When the transverse ridges are destroyed\n\nthey supply material which will allow the formation of longitudi\xc2\xad\nnal ridges. Thus all of thd criss-crossingstages can exist.\n\n2. When a Sahel environment replaces an arid environment\n\nthe change from transverse ripple to longitudinal ripple can be\n\ninterupted at different intermediate stages, which can be\n\nreflected in the landscape of a covered erg by different types\n\nof discontinuous longitudinal ripples.\n\nWhen the transvers wave is fixed before any degradation takes\n\nplace it can be subjected to erosion factors peculiar to the\n\nSahel: for example, the combination of primary water phenomena\n\nand winds which are still slightly active. The latter,\n\nchanneled by the transverse valleys, can help over scour the\n\nvalleys, creating a relief with a more differentiated topography.\n\nThe trnasverse wave of the Sahel is more sinuous and smaller\n\nthan in the arid regions which are not covered or only slightly\n\ncovered. This type of surface relief is not attractive to the\n\nfarmers of the Nigerian Sahel.\n\nThe transition from transverse to longitudinal is to be\n\nstudied in space and time.\n\n1. In space the currently covered erg of the Sahel region\n\nis an extension of the active F chi Bilma erg. Four types of\n\nperiodic relief succeed one another in this region, in the\n\nfollowing order going from upstream to downstream:\n\na longitudinal relief downwind from the Termit Massif;\n\na discontinuous longitudinal relief upwind from the Tanout\n\nmassif;\n\n42\n\na transverse relief which skirts th4\n\nKoutous Massif;\n\n\na discontinuous transverse relief which characterizes the\n\ndownstream portion of the covered erg until the current dies\n\nout completely at the foot of Ader Doutchi.\n\n\n2. In time, the reliefs deposited in an active erg then e\n\nevolved into existing forms when the erg became covered:\n\ncovered longitudinal wave resulting from regularization of\n\nthe transverse wave in the still active erg;\n\ndiscontinuous longitudinal\n\nwave due to regularization of\n\n/34\n\n\nthe transverse wave, halted during an intermediate stage and\n\nincomplete;\n\nfixed continuous transverse wave which only belongs to the\n\ntransverse wave oW the still active erg;\n\ndiscontinuous transverse wave inheirited from the transverse\n\nrelief in the process of formation in the still active erg,\n\nstopped in its evolution at an intermediate stage and\n\nincomplete.\n\n2.

It is organized into three\n\nspecific structures: in semi-circles, or oriented according to\n\ntwo tendencies, one transverse and the other longitudinal. The\n\nexistence of a monticular with a longitudinal tendency and a\n\ntransverse tendency implies that there is a relationship between\n\nthe period and the Monticular. The monticular has a transverse\n\ntendency when, in a hill, sandy landscape, the effects of\n\ntopographical obstacles makes themseles felt. It has a longi\xc2\xad\ntudinal tendency in regions dominated by deposits where deflation\n\nhas played an increasing role, as is the case downwind from the\n\nKoutous Massif or the Termit Massif.\n\na) The Semi-circular Monticular\n\nThis structure of swellings separated by cavities can\n\nvary depending on the size and the frequency of the two constituent\n\nmodules.

The small monticular which is the smallest module.\n\nIt is\n\n\nfound on the map of Tanout in 2 small places and on the map of\n\nGamou where it is larger. On the map of Tarka it is located\n\nsoutheast of Guidan Makao and northeast of Labara. On hthe map\n\nof Dakoro it is found between Bajani and Guidan Maza. In the\n\nexperimental square of Tchadwa-Mayahi the size of the alveolar\n\nformation is intermediate between the first two types mentioned.\n\n\n47\n\nb) The Direction-Oriented Monticular\n\n). Longitudinal orientation.\n\nThe two modules (monticule\n\n\nand alveous) are no longer organized in a multidirectional\n\nfashion, but rather they run in a west-southwest - east-northeast\n\ndirection.\n\nFor the most part we find it in the upper third\n\n\nof the Tarka and Dakaro maps (between Koren Mayata and the\n\nTchaglate Plateau), northwest of Guiday Roumji (south of Takorka\nand north of Oubandawaki) and\n\nalong the south bank of the\n\n\nvalley of the Goulbi N\'Kaba on the mapo6f Maraid\n\n2.Transverse Orientation.\n\nThe two modules are oriented in\n\n\na constant north-northwest - south-southeast direction.\n\nUsing the criterion of size the following distinctions can\n\nbe made:\n\n,1\n\n1. The small monticular with a transverse tendency is found\n\non the maps of Tanout, Gamou and East Zinder.\n\n2. The full monticular with a transverse tefidency is found\n\non the map of Gamou where it is adjacent to the small monticular\n\nwith a transverse tendency; on\n\nthe map of East Zinder where it\n\n\ndescribes a~north-south band and a second east-northeast --west\xc2\xad\nsouthwest band whibh becomes thinner and extends to 90 E; on the\n\nZinder Magaria map where a beach terminates the region of the\n\nsmall montlaular with a transverse tendency.\n\n3. The very large monticular with a transverse tendency is\n\nfound on the map of Zinder Magaria\n\nin a band 6 km long and 4 km\n\n\nwide, and on the map of East Zinder with an initial section\n\nmeasuring 8 km long and 6 km wide and then a secohd section\n\nmeasuring 20 km long and 6 km wide.\n\n\n48\n\n\n/38\n\n\nc) Formation and Evolution of the Monticular Sandy Relief\n\nThe perfect similarity between the measurements of the\n\nsemi-circular monticular and those of the transverse monticular\n\non the one hand and,\n\non the othea,\n\nih-tescession$ transver& \xc2\xad\n\ntransverse monticular - monticular" starting at the base of\n\ntopographical obstacles suggest that there is a relationship\n\nbetween these different structures.

It is the\n\nremoved sand which is migrating at the present time, forming\n\nsilks or reactivation nebkas.\n\nc) Proposed Explanation for the Appearance of these Dunes /42\n\nIn an active erg the shapes of the separated structures\n\nare due to deposit for the shield and to deposit and caving in\n\nalong the downwind face for structures such as Ithe barchan.\n\nThus we can trace the evolution from shield to dihedron, dihedron\n\nIn\n\nto barchan dihedron, barchan dihedron to barchan (Fig. 11).\na covered erg theeseparated structures are degradation or\n\ndestruction forms:\n\n(1) degradation in an initial stage when the\n\n\nseparate dune keeps\n\nthe characteristics that it had at the time\n\n\nof tits formation when the erg was active; (2) destruction in a\n\nsecond stage when the separate dune losses its own characteristics\n\nin acquiring others which are specific for covered ergs.\n\nThus\n\n\nwe can trace the following degradation process:\n\n\nC\n\nA\n\nE\n\nwind\n\nFig. 11.\n\nVarious stages of evolution for a barchan in the\n\n\nSahel region.\n\nA: The barchan structure is still recognizable, but it is\n\nmore or less degraded.\n\nB: The barchan structure again becomes a shield, looking like\n\na sandy, ovoid hill.\n\n53\n\nC: Destruction appears with scouring of a central cauldron.\n\nThis is the ovoid dune with a closed caoudeyre.\n\nD: A notch pointing towards the prevailing wind is formed.\n\nThis is the oveid dune with a open\n\n\nE: The notch enlarges.\ncaoudeyre.\n\n\nThis progression, considered over time, is revealed by\n\nexamples observed upwind in the experimental square: (1) we find\n\nslightly degraded barchans (stage A) on the Tanout map north of\n\nthe village of Yerima (14036t6"N and 8 0 15,4"E), and we find\n\nconi6al ovoid hills (stage B)\n\nin the vicinity of the barchans;\n\n\n(2) we find ovoid dunes with caoudeyres (stages C-E) on the \n\n\n/43\n\nTanout map west-northwest and east-southeast of the village of\n\nMaymagaria (14 0 12\'N and 8\'9\' to \'\xc2\xb0E), ile. upwind of the preceding\n\nregion, and we also find them on the Gamou map, west-southwest of\n\nthe village of Dania (14010?N and 90 to 9\xc2\xb01\'E).\n\nA few isolated hilly,\n\novoid dunes are found between these\n\n\ntwo locations.\n\nThese dunes have become the chosen site for the culture of\n\nmillet or sorghum. This breaks them down. Their peaks are\n\nreactivatedhowever\n\nif cultivation does not take place a pro\xc2\xad\n\ntective pavement appears.\n\nBurrowing animals, which are less\n\n\nnumerous than to the north of the Koutous Massif, here too bring\n\nto the surface fine sand which can easily be moved\n\nby the wind.\n\n\nThe interdunal spaces are vast, very gently sloping faces con\xc2\xad\nverging towards miniscule temporary ponds where the material,\n\nwhich is dgy in summer, is cracked by dessication cracks when\n\nit does not bear any hoof marks. The slopes whibh lead to these\n\nponds are subjected to intense icing.\n\nIn February, 1976, (the\n\n\ntime of our visit) there existed there only a few grassy places\n\n\n54\n\nwith shrubs or trees.\n\nIntense icing and runoff phenomena which\n\n\ncan cause gullies jepordize the stability of these forms.\n\nThe experimental square consists entirely of monticular\n\nsandy structures.\n\nThis study shows its position to be downwind\n\n\nfrom all the other sandy structures.\n\nThe section of monticular\n\n\nstructures is found downstream from all other types of dunes.\n\nBook II.\n\nY44\n\n\nClimatic Study of the Niger Republic\n\nChapter I.\n\nStudy of Princip &\n\nClimatic Parameters of the Niger\n\n\nRepublic\n\n\n/47\n\n\nMonthly Rainfall dorms from 1931 to 1960 (Fig. 13)\nRainfall norms are the precipatation averages over a period\n\nof 30 years.\n\nFig. 13 shows the monthly precipatation levels for\n\n\n6 stations in the Niger Republic (Maradi is station no. 5).\n\nThe\n\n\ninset in the upper left hand corner shows the averages of the\n\nsame stations over the same period of years with the annual\n\nnumber of the days of rain.\n\nThe precipitation profilesis comparable for all the stations.\n\nIn general, the rains last from April to October, the maximum\n\nmost often coming in August (ixcept for Main6 Soroa).\n\nMaradi and Gaya hold the records for amounts of water falling\n\nper day, (259.6 and 282 mm); Bilma holds the record for the\n\nsmallest amount.\n\nBetween the two we see a decrease from north\n\n\nto south, which speeds up after 150 N, and from west to east it\n\nspeeds up after 100 E.

Neverthe\xc2\xad\nless, they differ in the second maximum temperature maximum, which\n\ncomes in October for N\'Guigmi and in September for Agad~s.\n\nAnother difference is found in the maximum temperatures, which are\n\n\n63\n\n\n____greater fcr Agades.\n\nstation is a special case. On the one hand,\n\nthe maximum temperatures there are greater, and on the other hand\n\nthe second minimum (that wuibh corresponds to the rainy seaseon)\n\ndisappeared thus giving only a single maximum occuring in May-\n\n4. The Bilma\n\nSeptember for the maximum temperatures and between June and August\n\nfor the minimum temperatures.\n\nAverage Evaporation from 1961 to 1970 (Fig. 17). \n\n\n/58\n\nGeneral Outline of the Curve:\n\nTwo maximums in March or April (Depending on the stations),\n\nand two minimums in October or November, one in the rainy season\n\n(August) and the other in the dry season (December and January)\n\ncharacterize the Sahel of the Niger Rebpublic.\n\nThree groups of stations can be distinguished:\n\n1. One groupscombines 5 stations (N\'Guigmi, Main6 Soroa,\n\nZinder, Tahoua and Birni N\'Konni) which, in spite of differences\n\nin intensity, have very similar curves with two maximums in\n\nMarch and November and two minimums in August and December-January.\n\nincreases with continentality towards\n\nTke maximum evapp~ration\nthe east (Zinder, Maine Soroa and N\'Guigmi) and towards the\n\narid region in the north (Tahoua).\n\n2. One group combines 3 stations (Maradi, Tillabery and\n\nUp until August the curves for all 3 stations do not\n\nNiamey).\nshow aniy unusual features.\n\nThen, the November maximum is erased\n\n\nand the December minimum no longef exists because evaporation\n\nis greater in De\'ember than in Octobef and November.\n\n3.

II. Study of Winds in the Niger Republic\n1. Prevailing Annual Directions of Winds in the Niger Repbulic\n\n(Fig. 18)\n\nThe prevailihg winds are divided into 2 regions: (1) a NNE-\n\nENE regionacorresponding to the Harmattan and a SW regions\n\ncorresponding to the monsoon.\n\n1. The Harmattan\n\nIts frequency is hardly seen to diminish as a function\n\nof latitude and longitude.\n\nTahoua receives a harmattan equivalent\n\n\not that which is received by Bilma in spite of a difference in\'\n\nlongitude of 80.\n\nBilma, N\'Guigmi and Niamey, which differ in\n\n\nlatitude by 60, receive equally frequent amounts of harmattan.\n\n\n71\n\nThis map reveals three different circulation paths for the\n\nharmattan:\n\na) the Sahara stations of Bilma and Agades receive a harmattan\n\nfrom "he NE.\n\nThis is a barely deflected continental trade wind,\n\n\nor, if there is deflection, it is due to the Tibesti massif.\n\nb) The direction 6f the harmattan which arrives at Tahoua\n\nand N\'Guigmi has a much more sautherly direction.\n\nIts NNE\n\n\ndirection results from the trade wind being channeled at Tahoua\n\nbetween north of Air and louth of Hoggar and at N\'Guigmin between\n\nnorth of Djado and the northwest point of the Tibests.\n\nc) The Sahel stations of Niamey, Birni N\'Konni, Maradi and\n\nZinder a harmattan with a much more regional tendency which is\n\naccentuated from Niamey to Zinder.\n\n2. The Winds of the Rainy Season\n\nThe monsoon decreases very distinctly and uniformly\n\nfrom Niamey to NjGuigmi.\n\nWith the exception of the Zinder station\n\n\nits direction in all places is SW.\n\nWith respect to the monsoon\n\n\nTahoua is like Niamey, but with respect to the harmattan it is\n\nlike Zinder and N\'Guigmi.\n\nOne can thus conclude that between\n\n\nMaradi and Zinder a change in the wind patters occurs.\n\nWe think that the Mayahi-Tchadaoua experimental unit has\n\n/61\n\n\nroughly the same wind characteristics as Maradi, whibh is very\n\nimportant for the installations of wind breaks.\n\nIf the installation\n\n\nof wind breaks is recommended, these will have a NW direction\n\nwhich fortunately is found to be both perpendicular to the\n\nharmattan and perpendicular to the effective wind which is not\n\ninsignificant at the beginning of the rainyseason, since the\n\nharmattan and monsoon follow roughly the same line but in\n\nopposite directions.\n\n\n72\n\n\nAI\n\nSI\n_\n\n_\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2__\n\nFig.\n\nN\n\n/\n\n18.\n\n,\not!\'\n...\n\n\'IIiO\n\n\', ,\n\n...\n,\n\ni\n\n/\n\n3"*-\n\n\n"zQ\n\n.\n\'- .\n\n\n\'\n\nPrevailing wind directions\n\nin the Niger Republic\n\n"f\n\n,,Is,\n\n/\n\no\n\n0\n\n-7-\n\nin\n,\n,--.\n\nC.\n\nhil\nrac\n\nF.,\n\n\xc2\xb0\n\nj .\n3\n\n"._.\n\n.\n\n\n,R\n\n-,\'AI .\n\n2o \xc2\xad\n\n" \n\n\n\'\n\nJ\n\nAgadem\n\nGAD\n\n\' AG \n\n\n/.\n\nAA\n\n/\n\ni\n\n\nA (\n\nA\n\n-\n\nI\n\n~\n\nI ma\n\n,\n\n,illaTri\n\n\'\n\nTANOUAi ,\n_.: .,\nirni\n\nNIAMEy \n\n.\n\n-\'\n\n.4\n,\n\nc\'/ DOSSO\nGa 0\n\nKon\n\n.\n\n"\n\n-\'~\n\n.G o--.- --\n\n-1\n.... -\n\nMaq aria \\\n\n..\n\ne.\'\'-.\n\n.\n/\n\n0\n\n.--\n\n/Y\n.-- , A\n\n\n"\\-\n\nNiGuiP\n\n\n-o\n\n1\n-- iy.-hi\n\n,\n\n-\n\nGaya4?\n\n-\n\nak\n\n\'\n. -_/.\n\nT-...,ra\n\n%\n\n.\' \n\n\n#-\'\n\n,\'\n\nr\n\n--\n\n-.\n\n\'04.\n%,/f\nGA\n\n-5u\nj\n\nMaineS\n- ,\n\n\nLi\n\n\\M,-A \n\n\n0!\n\n\n)\n\nPOT.SKUM\n\nID\n\nMA-.,(\nA\n\n-\n\n.2"\n\nV _\n\n/63\n\nLegend\n\n\niD\n\nEDO\n\n74\n\nt;\n\n200 observations for the dry season winds\n\n200 observations for the rainy season winds\n\n\n..\n\n.\n\n.\n\n..\n\n/64\n\n\nAverage Annual Number of Prevailing Winds in the Niger Republic\n\n\nTATION \t\n\nYears\n\n\nI \n\n\nPreva-iling \n\nDirection \n\n\n.. .. .. ...\n.\n\nAGADES \t\n\n. ..\n\n. .. \n\n\nAverage Number\n\nof winds\n\n. . .\n\n\n-_\n\n\n__.. \n\n\n1966 & 1975 \n\n\nRor&-Est\n\nNE \n\n\n811\n\n\n1 \tAGADES\n\n1966 & 1975\n\nSud-Est\n\nSE \n\n\n1167\n\n\nAGADES\n\n1966 & 1975\n\nSud-Guest SW \n\n\n239\n\n\nBIL14A\n\n1966 b 1971-\n 1975 \n Nor&-Est NE \n\n\n932\n\n\nBILK&\n\n1966 & 1971-\n 1975 \n Sud-Est\n\nSE \n\n\n352\n\n\nBIRNI N\'KONNI\n\n1966 L 1975 \n\n\nNord-Est NE \n\n\n816\n\n\nBIRNI N\'KONNNI\n\n1966 & 1975 \n\n\nSud-Ouest SW \n\n\n710\n\n\nMAINE SOROA\n\n1966 & 1971-\n 1975 \n Nord-Est NE \n\n\n913\n\n\nMAINE SOROA\n\n1966 & 1971-\n 1975 \n Sud-Ouest SW\n\n430\n\n\nMAHADI\n\n1966 & 1975 \n\n\nNord-Est NE \n\n\n924\n\n\nIMJURADI\n\n1966 & 1975 \n\n\nSud-Ouest SW \n\n\n582\n\n\nN\'GUIGMI\n\n1966 & 1975 \n\n\nNord-Est NE \n\n\n908\n\n\nN\'GUIGMI,\n\n1966 & 1975 \n\n\nSud-Ouert SW \n\n\n509\n\n\n\'1966 & 1975 \n\n\nNord-Est NE \n\n\n822\n\n\nNiAtEY \t\n\n1966 - 1975\n\nSud-Ouest SW \n\n\n902\n\n\nTAHOUA \t\n\n1966 & 1975 \n\n\n1 Nord-Est NE\n\n924\n\n\nTAHOUA \t\n\n1966 & 1975 \n\n\nSud-Ouest SW\n\n825\n\n\nZINDER \t\n\n1966 & 1975 \n\n\nNord-Est NE \n\n\nZINDER \t\n\n1966 & 1975 \n\n\nSud-OuestSW\n\nNIAMEY\n\n1123\n\n\n511\n\n\n75\n\n3.-eThe Winds of the Southeast\n\n\nSE.\n\nBilma and predominantly Agades receive winds from the\n\nWe donnot yet have any explanation for these winds.\n\n4.

Monthly Prevailing Wind Directions in the Niger Republic\n\n/65\n\n(Figs. 19-30)\nThe study of annual prevailing wind directions in the Niger\n\nRepbulic was supplemented by a study of monthly winds. The\n\nreason for this was to provide a rigorous study for a protection\n\nprogram\n\nagainst wind erosion.\n\n\nIn January, February and March the Niger Repbulic is affected\n\nonly by winds from the NE, with the exception of Agades which\n\nreceives winds from the SE during the entire year with maximums\n\nfrom December to May. In March the westernmost stations (Niamey\n\nand Tahoua) receive the first incursion of the monsoon. This\n\ntendency asserts itself in April when the winds from the SW\n\nthen spread out through the entire Sahel region of the Niger\n\nRepblic. The monsoon still does not reach Agad~s. InMMay the\n\nharmattan dies out persisting at a longitude only up to Maradi.\n\nTahoua still receives a little of it because of its latitude.\n\nThe harmattan finally disappears. In May Agad\'s receives the\n\nfirst puffs of the monsoon which has been established.\n\nIn June\n\n\nthe above trends assert themselves: the trade wind stops at the\n\nlatitude of Zinder and the longitude of Agad~s.\n\n76\n\nNiamey and Tahoua\n\n\nreceive the strongest monsoon.\n\nIn July and August the harmattan\n\n\nreaches no further than N\'Guigmi.\n\nThe flow is from the prevailing\n\n\nSW quadrant up until September when the situation reverses itself\n\nagains with the monsoon dying out and a trade wind reappearing\n\nfurther south, at Tahoua and further west, at Zinder. In October\n\nthe situation of April seems to reproduce itself with a\n\nweakening monsoon which no longer reaches Agad~s and a trade\n\nwind which again becomes predominant, reaching Niamey.\npresents a special case.\n\nZinder\n\n\nThere is no longer any monsoon in\n\n\nOctober, while at N\'Guigmi it is still blowing.\n\nThis is probably\n\n\ndue to the direction and the existence of an obstacle.\n\nAt\n\n\nZinder the monsoon is nearly east-west which causes it to cross\n\nthe Ader Doutchi, and its crossing manages to extinguish its\n\nlasts ]uffs earlier than at N\'Guigmi which, however is further\n\naway. Because of its SW direction it does not encounter any\n\nobstacles. From November to February the prevailing trade wind\n\nblows, diminishing towards the south and west.\n\nAt Bilma, in\n\n\nDebember, winds blow from the SW which are difficult to explain.\n\nIn summary, an examination of these monthly winds allows us:\n\n1. To distinguish different stations of the Sahara as a\n\nresult of the direction of the monsoon current aid because of\n\nobstacles.\n\n2. To note a progression from east to west, from N\'Guigmi to\n\nNiamey, with a transition between Zinder and Maradi. In some\n\nrespects Tahoua is similar to Zinder and N\'Guigmi because of its\n\nlatitude.\n\nIt receives the trade wind earlier than Niamey, Birni\n\n/66\n\n\nN\'Konni and Maradi, but it keeps characteristics of a western\n\nstation in receiv&iig the monsoon earlier than Birni N\'Konni, Mar\n\nMaradi, Zinder and N\'Guigmi.\n\n3. To point o~t the transition months\'. April and October.\n\n\n77\n\n4. To\n\nsee the remarkable separation between two six-month\n\n\nseasons, from January to August and from September to December\n\n[sic].\n\n5.

Wet Season Winds\n\n\nFrom 1973 to 1974 the number of wet season winds was\n\nmore homogeneous from one stationsto another and, on average,\n\nsmaller than before 1971.\n\nThree groups can be dis-tinguished according to the number of\n\nwinds:\n\na\n1. \t small number of winds for Agadls (239) and Bilma(352);\n\n2. an average number of winds for N\'Guigmi (509), Maine\n\nSoroa (430), Zinder (511) and Maradi (582);\n\n3. \t many winds for Birni N\'Konni (710), Tahoua (825) and\nNiamey (902).\nMinimum points common to several stations:\n\n- in 1967 for Niamey, Birni N\'Konni, Tahoua, Maradi,\n\n- in 1968 for MainC Sorea, Bilma and N\'Guigmi,\n\n- i6 1969 for Zinder and Agad s,\n\n- in 1970 for Niamey, Birni N\'Konni and Tahoua,\n\n- in 1971 for Maradi, Maine Soroa and Agadbs,\n\n- in 1973 for Niamey, Birni N\'Konni, Zinder, Maradi and\n\nN\'Guigmi,\n\n- in 1975 for Maradi, Birni NIKonni, Zinder, N\'Guigmi,\n\nBilma and Agadbs.\n\n\n104\n\nNaximum points common to several stations:\n\n-\n\nin 1966 for all the stations,\n\n\n-\n\nin 1969 for Tahoua, Niamey, Birni NIKonni and Maradi,\n\n\n-\n\nin 1970 for N\'Guigmi, Bilina, Maine Soroa and Agadas,\n\n\n-\n\nin 1972 for N\'Guigmi, Tahoua, Earadi, Zinder and Agad s,\n\n\n-\n\nin 1974 for N\'Guigmi and Maradi,\n\n\n-\n\nin 1975 for Niamey, Main6 Soroa and Tahoua.\n\n\nIn summary, The period of dryness from 1969 to 1972 is\n\nreflected by increases in harmattan-type winds at Adages, Zinder\n\nand Tahoua, and to a lesser degree at Maradi, Birni N\'Konni and\n\nNiamey.\n\nThe monsoon-type winds clearly diminished during the\n\n\nsame period of dryness from 1967 to 1970.\n\nThe three stations\n\n\nof N\'Guigmi, Main6 Soroa and Zinder experienced the greatest\n\ndecrease in 1968.\nhave\n\nBilma and Agades, the two desert stations,\n\n\na place apart because of the small number of wet season\n\n\nwinds.\n\n\n105\n\n/93\n\n\n6.

In particular, we looked at (1) changes in rainfall\n\npatterns -- shortening of the rainy season or decrease in the\n\noverall annual amount -- (2) changes in wind patterns by an\n\nincrease in dry season winds, a decrease in monsoon winds or an\n\nintrusion of new winds.\n\nIt is difficult to come up with indisputable conclusions.\n\nWith respect to the climate in Africa, isn\'t it said that each\n\nyear is exceptional?\n\n\'.\n\n\nPresentation of Rose Diagrams\n\nThe rose diagrams from 1972 to 1974 were made by a computer\n\nat the University Institute of Technology of the University of\n\nReims from magnetic tapes supplied by ASECNA using a program\n\nwritten by A. Jarlaud of the UIT.\n1971 were done by hand.\n\nThe rose diagrams for 1966 to\n\nNevertheless, the presentation is pretty\n\n\nmuch the same.\n\nEach rose illustrates the data for the month\n\nwhich is indicated in abbreviated form in the center of the\n\ncircle.\n\nEach sheet caries either the first 6 months or the last\n\n\n6 months of the year indicated.\n\nThe monthly rose diagrams include 3 types of data:\n\n1. The direction of the wind is indicated from Jan. 1966 to\n\nAug. 1968 by the letters of the rose (i.e. 16 directions) and from\n\nAug. 1968 to Dec. 1974 by every 20\' (i.e. 18 directions).\n\n2.

It is the harmattan.\n\nDuring the rainy season winds blow from the southwest-- south\xc2\xad\nsouthwest. Here again they are easy to recognize. These are\n\nthe monsoon winds which carry water. During the summer months the\n\nmonsoon winds are accompanied by blasts of wind from the east.\n\nDuring the two interm~diate seasons, which can be defined as\n\nApril and October, winds blow from all directions.\n\nThe winds from the north=northwest affect all stations\n\nduring all months, with a maximum in the winter season from U\n\nNovember to February. We are unable to explain what causes these\n\nwinds. Likewise, we do not know the origin of the winds from the\n\nsoutheast which sometimes become dominant, as in February, 1971.\n\nIs it the trade wind from the Southern Hemisphere which crosses\n\nthe equator without being deflected, or which indeed, according\nto the scheme of G. Dhonneur, is deflected when it crosses the\nequator and becomes a monsoon, then in the most continental regions\nof Africa is deflected again so that it resumes its initial \xc2\xad\ndirection?\n\n\n108\n\nStudy of the Arithmetic Average of Prevailing Winds, Covering\n\ne\nthlieh riod of 1961 to 1970 for the Stations of Agad(s, Bilma,\n\nBirni N\'Konni, Maradi and Tahoua\n\nThis study reu&als winds which are not very effective for\n\ntransporting sand. In fact, only those of the months of January,\n\nFebruary (and March for Tahoua) have average speeds over a period\n\nof 10 years greater than 4 meters per second, i.e. winds suitable\n\nfor transport by saltation of sand when the sand is fine. The\n\nmost striking fact is, for Maradi and Birni N\'Konni, the extra\xc2\xad\nordinary similarity of direction for the average of the prevailing\n\nwinds except during the interseasonal periods of March-April and\n\nOctober. At Maradi the monsoon winds last a month longer than\n\nThus one witnesses the triumph of latitude\n\n(the difference is small, however) over the criterion of\n\ncontinentality. At Maradi the interseasonal period of March-\n\nApril is expressed in the wind pattern by harmattan-type winds\n\nat Birni N\'Konni.\n\ngiving way to winds from the east.\n\nThe interseasonal period\n\n\ndisappears completely at Birni N\'Konni, which is characterized by\n\nhaving only two clearly divided seasons -- one receiving winds\n\nfrom the east (thus a harmattan with a regional direction) from\n\nOctober to March and a monsoon coming from the southwest from\n\nApril to September.\n\nThis same well pronounced contrast is found at Tahoua. The\n\nmonths from October to April receive winds from the northeast,\n\ntypical harmattan, while the months from May to September are\n\ncharacterized by winds whose direction is specifically that of the\n\nmonsoon, however with two small shifts towards the south-southwest\n\nduring the interseasonal period: May and September.\n\nBilma is a typical SahariAn station, especially subject to\n\n/96\n\n\nharmattan 11 months out of 12. Agad6s, although it lies in\n\nthe latitude of the Sahara, receives winds whose direction is\n\ncontrolled by the arrangement of obstacles surrounding it.\n\nthe\n\n109\n\n\nOF 0O\n\n(,\n\n-.\n\n..... \n\n\nQ-.r" \n\n\nJanuary\n\nFebruary\n\nA,\n\nQ13MA\n\n......\n\n./97\n\nMarch\n\nnK>\n%tevMay\n\nApril\n\nJune\n\ntj\\\n\n\n-5r\n\n-U\n\nJuly\n\nOctober\n\nAugust\n\nSeptember\n\n\nNovember\n\n\nDecember\n\n[Typical for all subsequent pages]\n\n\n110\n\nAGADE43 1966\n\n\n/98\n\n\nF S\n\n--\n\n--\n\n\xc2\xad\n\n7\n\n\n",-\n\n4.\n\nN. \n\n\nSSE\n\nAGADES 1967\n\n111\n\n\n"W\n\n/99\n\n\nT\n\nAi *g .\n\n4.\n\n-\n\n.\n\n..\n\n!,\n\nIt\n\nNO.\n\n0- 51968\n\n112\n\n/100\n\n\n-\\\n\nh \xc2\xad,\n\nirP/\n\no\n\n",\n\n/---t\n\nI[\n\ni\n\nI\n\nAGADES 19 6-9\n113\n\n1/10\n\n\nAGADS 1970\n\n\n/102\n\n\n*-\n\n\xc2\xad\n\nAV\n\n/o\n\n.c\n\nC\n\nt\n\nIlk\n\n" "\n\nJ\nt!\n\n1$\n\n115\n\n-N.\n\n"--.\n\nN\n\nN\n4.4\n\n"N\n\n-.\n\nN\n\n"\n\n49.AGA\nll6\n\n-...\n\nI\n\n-~\n\n1\n\n\n$\n\nI\n\nII\n\n\n/as\n\n\nF~1\n\n___\n-..\n,,.,. \n\n\n"\' -..\n\n\nA\n\n*2D173\n\nS\n\ni\n\n\n/105\n\n\n,N\n\n\\\'\\\n\nVA/\n-"\xc2\xad\n~\\\n\n-6z\n\n118>\n\n\nAGADES 1974\n\n\n-\n\n/106\n\n1\n\n-C.\n\nSt\n\n-.\n\n\nt\n\nAGDI\n\n\'I\n\xc2\xad\n\n17\n\n\nll9\n\n\nMonthly Rose Diagrams fbr the Period 1966 to 1975 \n\nAgad~s (latitude:\n\n170 N\n\nLongitude:\n\n/107\n\n7\xc2\xb059\'E)\n\n\nAgades could be refered to as a station of obstacles.\n\nIts\n\n\nposition, hemmed in by the southwest overhang of the Ar, explains\n\nthe three prevailing wind directions: winds from east-southeast\n\n(i.e. regional direction) from October to June; winds from the\n\nwest from July to September, the latter being the transition\n\nmonth; very violent, effective and frequent winds blew from the\n\nsoutheast from September, 1970 to May, 1971.

Interseasonal periods\n\nApril: there is no prevailing wind, except if there is an\n\nextension of the three preceding months.\n\nThis was the case in\n\n\n1970-71 and 1973 when the dry season was extended up until May.\n\nAlso at this time there are the most effective winds: their\n\nfrequency always increases in proportion with the frequency of winds\n\nin general.\n\nMay: First barely perceptible signs of a prevailing wind\n\nsector becoming established between 180\n\nand 260\'.\n\n\nOctober: transition month between the rainy season and dry\n\n\n162\n\nseasdn, can already be either already under the iifluence of\n\nprevailing wdnds of the rainy season or maybbe without any pre-1\n\nvailing wind.\n\nBut the winds of October can also extend the\n\n\ndry season and thus still receive winds coming from an arc\n\nranging between east and northeast.\n\n3 - Rainy Season (June to September, October for 1969).\n\nThe winds are concentrated in a clearly dominant sector\n\nfrom the south, from 2000 to 2600, and 2800 maximum.\n\nThere\n\n\nare very few efficient winds, and these always come from between\n\n2200 and 24\'60.\n\nThe winds from the southeast, which are still unexplained,\n\nexist in all seasons (February 1971, October,1975, May-June 1976).\n\nHowever, they are interesting since when they do exist they are\n\nefficinet and dominant.\n\n\n163\n\nI\n\n/\n,\n\n/\n\nS\n\n/150\n\n-\n\n"\n\nI\n\n/\n\n\\,\n-I\n\nl\n\n-- -

N\'Guigmi\n\nhas very Saharian features, such as a large variation in rainfall\n\n\nhomogeneous.\n\nand one year in the series without any south or southwest wind.\n\nOn the contrary, Naamey shows a high degree\n\n(wet season wind).\nof uniformity from year to year. The month of march, whose index\n\nis the highest, has all the characteristics of a transition month,\n\nhence a beginning of the wet season as early as march, a month\n\nwhich already receives periodic rainfall.\n\n2) The Group of Stations with Two Instability Maximums\n\nThis group is divided into two subgroups:\n\nconsists of the stations whose instability\n\nmaximum is situated at the end of the wet season (Octobrer): Birni\n\na) one subgroup\n\nN 1 Konni and Maradi.\n\n\n214\n\n\nThese two stations thus have a wet season whose instability\n\ntends to prolong the potential period of precipitation.\n\n\nb) This group consists of the stations whose instability\n\nmaximum is situated at the beginning of the wet season (April):\n\nTahoua and Zinder.\n\nThis type of instability characterize6 stations whose wet\n\nseason ends during the month of October and begins some time in\n\nApril.\n\nThese two stations therefore have a wet season whose instability\n\ntends to reduce the potential period of precipitation\n\nThe study of this instability index is supported by the\n\n/199\n\n\nanalysis of Jo\xc2\xa7l Charre, who states that "one can, however,\n\ndeduce that the duration of the wet season has all chances of\n\nbeing as much longer as the beginning was early."\n\nIn addition, it should be noted that the presence of dry\n\nyears (1969 to 1972) in the series does not play a particularly\n\nsignificant role in the distribution of the types of months\n\n(with winds prevailing from the east or from the south-southwest)\n\nover all of the months of the year, i.e. not forfthe directions\n\nbut for the wind intensities.\n\nThis comparative study reveals the break in the rainfall\n\npattern between Maradi and Zinder. Maradi represents the eastern\n\nmost Sahel type, which is characterized most homogeneously-by\n\nNiamey. Zinder represents the westernmost station of the Sahara\n\ntype, which is characterized by N\'Guigmi and Bilma. Tahoua is\n\nfound in this region because of its latitude and the obstacle effect\n\n\n215\n\n\nThe break is also manifested by the relative values\n\nof the instability index maximums. Maradi has the highest values\n\nof the Sahel type.\n\nof the Air.\n\nThis leads to the following fundamental conclusion: the means\n\nof the instability indicies of the wind decrease from N\'Guigmi\n\nto Zinder then, after a break region, they undergo a similar\n\ndecrease from Maradi to Niamey.\n\nAgad~s.\n\nAnalysis of\n\nthe Prevailing Winds and Their Frequency\n\n1966-1975 (Fig. 46).\n\nPrevailing Winds\n\nThe prevailing winds are characterized by the absence of\n\na monthly dominance of winds from the sector ranging from south to\n\nsouthwest. Only 2 months (July and August) give, on average, a\n\ndominant west direction (260\'-265\').\n\nThe winter months (from October to May)aare characterized\n\nThe\n\nby an average of winds from the east between 900 and 1200.\ndifference\n\nbetween\n\nthe averages is 300\n\n(from 900 to 1200).\n\n\nTwo months can be considered transition months -- June and\n\nSeptember -- with alternations between winds from the east and\n\nwinds from the west.\n\nFor two ypars the month of June had winds\n\n\nfrom the west, and for 1 year September had winds from the west\n\n\n(1966).\n\nThese winds are characterized by a small interannual dispersion\n\nindex, with the exception of the transition months.\n\nFrequencies\n\nThree groups, stand out:\n\n216\n\n\n/201\n\n\ni.t. : ; .\n.: 4\n\n,\n\n- -t\n\n" "\'\n\nL-\n\nV.\n\ni" ":\n\n\'I.\n\n\xc2\xad\n\ni\'i --- -------------\xc2\xad\n.\ni\n\n: .j:. ,L.. . .\nT\n\n{2E"WE ....\nL,\n\nI I"[\n\n"L\n\nI\n\nl\n\n:: t\n\n:! .\n\nI\n\nI....\n-I,,\n\n........\n\n.\n\nAgades\n\n\nI::..h 1975.\n\n2 0 r..\n20.Ireadings.\n\n\\\':..;.;I,\n\n~\niF.\n\n.\n\n\ni\n\nI\n\nL\n\ni\n\n.\n\n".. ... .\' "\'"\n... -: .\nr=;\n\n. ..\n\n\'N-0-0\n\n.-\n\nF..\n\n,\n\n. . . ....\n\nt\n\n.:_\n\ni\n\n". ..I .. .:..I\n\nT..\n\n: ; ::: . :..._:&.. -Y \' ".L :\n. b :(-\n\n":. :\n\n"\n\nL\n\n.\n\n:,\n\'K6\n,L \' : : . , :::\nI,:..\n\n. .- ... .. -:\xe2\x80\xa2\n:. : . /\n\n\' .. ... ..\n\ni\n\n, . .,,\n\n:\' "IP \n\n\nI\n"\n\n.\'.I\n_\n\n. ..",_ - _.\n.(\n"\n\n\nt\n\n.\n\ni \n\n\n. .. ..\n\n2 .1":\'."".\n1.:\n\n11\n\n-["\'\n\nt: i:I\n\n.\n\n:.....\n\nl i i i\n\ni;;:I" } ..\n:, :\n:\'-\n\n..\n2.\n\nl\n\n\n. ...;\n\n..\n\n\'1\n\n......

A group of months in which the average of the\n\nfrequencies is very stable. From May to August, these are the months\n\nof the wet season.\n\n2. The months of high frequency: November, December and\n\nJanuary. These are the months whose dominant winds are directional\n\nand not sectorial.

As a result, the dominant direction is alwgys\n\nbounded by subdominant directions with high frequencies (cf. rose\n\ndiagrams). Thus the notion of a dominantdirection- losses its\n\nsignificance compared to the fotion of a dominant sector.\n\nIn the transition period the frequencies are very hetero\xc2\xad\ngeneous which can be attributed to the alternation in direction.\n\nInstability Index\n\n/217\n\n\nThe dispersion indicies of the frequencies and dominant\n\ndirections studied, expressed in the form of this index, enable\n\nus to refine the study of the individual months.\n\nThere appears a group of months with a low instability index,\n\nhence with little dispersion in frequency and direction for the\n\nseries of years under consideration.\nJanuary and from June to September.\n\nThese are the months of\n\nThere is also a group of\n\n\nmonths with an average instability index (February, March, May and\n\nDecember), and a group with a very hith index (April, October and\n\nNovember).\n\nThis\n\nlast group corresponds to the transition months\n\nand to the months when the dry season becomes established, with\n\nlarge variation differences in direction and especially in frequency.\n\n\n234\n\n\nThe group with an average instability index is formed by the dry\n\nseason months in addition to May (distortion due to 1973, an\n\naberrant year in the series).\n\nThe\n\ngroup with a low instability\n\n\nindex corresponds to all of the rainy season months plus\n\nJanuary.\n\nThe dry season is characterized by a high level of over all\n\ninstability which gradually reduces up to the month of January,\n\nthe month with a dominant NE wind.\n\nAs January is one of the\n\n\nmonths in whibh the percentage of effective winds issgreatest,\n\nit is to be thought\'tthat eolian reactivation phenomena of a certain\n\nstrength should be operative during this period, and also during\n\nthe month of March.\n\nIn the latter month, however, the average\n\n\neffectiveness is less.\n\nAt the monthly level the wet season is characterized by a\n\nvery high level of stability both in average directions and in\n\nfrequencies.\n\nThe oppostion between dry season and rainy season is reflected\n\nin the main directions of the winds of the two seasons as well as\n\nin the pattern and "character" of the two periods.\n\nObtaining a Monthly Instability Index\n\nThis index is obtained by multiplying the dispersion\n\nindices of frequencies and dominant directions and then dividing\n\nthis product by the average frequency of the month for the years\n\nunder consideration.

Thus, on the whole,\n\nthe current from Bilma is more stable than the current from\n\nN\'Gailgmi. On the basis of the frequencies the followinggdistinction\n\ncan be made: the current from Bilma is characterized by one\n\nspecific direction, while the current from N\'Guigmi is char\xc2\xad\nacterized by a dominant sector.\n\nInstability Index\n\n/221\n\n\nThe interannual instability index at Zinder characterizes\n\nthe year in the following way: the rainy season months have a\n\nvery low index; the transition months are feflected by the\n\ninstability index (these are the months of April, May and, October\n\nwhose indicies are very high); and the dry season months have an\n\n\n238\n\n\naverage instability index.\n\nat Zinder have a higher\n\n\nOn average, the wind directions\n\ninstability index than those of the Bilma current alone, whibh\n\nconfirms the distinction between dominant direction and dominant\n\nsector.\n\nConclusion\n\nOn average, Zinder is a station with a short rainy\n\nseason for the period of years considered.\n\nThe dry season is\n\n\naffected by two currents with Adjacent directions, but they\n\nalways remain quite distinct.\n\nChapter III.\n\n/222\n\n\nClimatic Parameters of Maradi\n\nRainfall at Tarna and Maradi from 1932 to 1975 (Fig. 53)\n\n/224\n\n\nThe period from 1932 to 1949 is characterized by an extremely\n\naccentuated saw tooth pattern with minimums for 1934, 1942 and\n\n1949.\n\nThe minimum of 1934\n\n(436 mm at Maradi, 435 mm at Tarna)\n\n\nis followed by a sharp rise in 1939 (985 mm at Maradi) and in\n\n1940 (725 mm\n\nat Tarna).\n\nIn 1942 another drop in precipitation\n\n\n(365 mm at Tarna and 455 mm at Maradi)\na spectacular rise as that of 1939.\n\nis not followed by such\n\n\nIn 1945 the total amount of\n\n\nof precipitation at Tarna is 806 mm, and 749 mm\n1946.\n\nat Maradi in\n\n\nIn 19_49 Maradi received only 367 mm of precipitation and\n\n\nTarna 357, mm.\n\nFrom 1949 to 1967 the saw teeth are much smaller but con\xc2\xad\nstant.

The difference of the periodic averages from the overall\n\naverage. This difference is zero or nearly zero for the period\n\n1932 to 1949. The difference is moderate for the period 1949 to\n\n1967 (1.1 for Maradi and 1.6 for Tarna.) The difference is great\n\nfor the period 1967 to 1976 (3.3 for Maradi and 3.1 for Tarna).\n\nIt should be noted that from 1949 to 1967 the difference is positive\n\nand for 1967 to 1976 it is negative.\n\n2.

Comparison with Aerial Photographs.\n\nThe overall dunal structure of this region is made up of\n\nmonticular-type sandy structures.\n\nLocally, however, this\n\n\nstructure is replaced either by a transverse monticular structure\n\nor by transverse dunes, or by hilly structures dispersed over\n\nthe rocky, outcropping gase of the southern Niger Republic, or\n\nagain, south of Tchadaoua, by longitudinal dunes (local regulari,\n\nzation of the monticular structure).\n\nNow texture 4, dark gray,\n\n\nwhich could be likened to forests classified on the basis of the\n\ntopographical at a scale of 1:200,000, on aerial photographs\n\ncorresponds to dunal structures, which are not monticular, drawn\n\non a map at a scale of 1:1,000,000 entitled "Natural Wind and\n\nWater Erosion Mechanisms and Their Evaluataion With Respect to\n\nthe Degradation of Bandy Landscapes."\n\n4. Combining the Three Preceding Steps and Ground Analysis,\n\n/239\n\n\nEnabling Us to Define Interpretation Keys\n\nTexture 1: it can be interpreted\n\nas resulting from the\n\n\nhigh density of human occupation in regions with a monticular\n\narrangement\n\nand from the various degrees of modification in the\n\n\nbehavior of the sandy covering. These changes were detailed,\n\nin particular, on the basis of ground observations and work with\n\n\n251\n\naerial photographs.\n\nWithin the context of a map of the effects\n\n\nof dryness for the entire Sahel, this texture would belong to a\n\ncategory entitled: "Danger of Serious Breakdown of the Monticular\n\nStructure by Water and Wind Erosion as a Result of Overuse."\n\nTexture 2: The density of human occupation in these regions\n\nof monticular dunes does not cause any dangerous immediate\n\ndegradation of the sandy covering.\n\nTexture 3: the population density in these areas is lower\n\nthan in the two preceding cases, for no apparent reason.\n\nTixture 4: The population density is practically zero, either\n\nbecause of the establishment of restrictions (classified forests)\n\nor because of the unattractive environment created by dunal\n\nstructures such as the transverse monticular, for example, between\n\nthe Maradi goumbi and the Nielwa goulbi, or the hilly dunes east\n\nof Dan Isa.\n\nTixture 5: the clear gray area with diffuse dots corresponds\n\nThe site of\n\nto villages, as we have seen under heading 1f2V"\nthe dot, however, does not correspond to the actual size of the\n\nActually, the separate gray spot on the satellite\n\nvillages.\npicture corresponds to the actual village and the fertilized\n\narea surrounding it.(see 1:20,000 map).\n\nTexture 6: the curved lines crossing the other textures\n\nwere interpreted by broadening the study (limited initially to\n\nthe experimental square) to the east as far as Termit and to the\n\nwest as far as Niamey. These are deflation stria due to winds\n\nsweeping sandy surfaces arranged in a\n\nmonticular structure.\n\nThe\n\n\nstria end to the east of the figure of eolian erosion bands.\n\nTexture 7: this corresponds to a network of dry valleys stuck\n\n\n252\n\nin their topography, probably after they ceased to function and\n\nafter the halt of eolian activities. These are the tributaries\n\nof the left bank of the N\'Kaba goulbi. They are difficult, if\n\nnot impossible, to perceive on the ground and difficult to follow\n\nin the aerial photographs. It is likely that they can be seen\n\nin the satellite pictures because they are drier than the dunes\n\nwhose sand is more strudtured. We propose this hypothesis of\n\ndrier sand because, in addition, these valleys appear clear, al\xc2\xad\nmost white, on channel 4.\nseen on channel 7.\n\nChapter II. Description\nExperimental Unit\n\n\nOn the other hand, they cannot be\n\n\nand Problems of Reactivation in the\n\n/240\n\n\n1. Monticular Sandy Structures\n\nThe experimental unit is a region of monticular dines. This\n\ntype of structure begins upwind from the unit, south of a latitude\n\nof 15 0 20\'N, i.e. with a current annual rainfall of 250 mm, and\n\nwest of a\n\ndiagonal running from NNW to SSE which passes between\n\n\nthe two massifs of Koutous and Tanout.\n\na) Specific Location of the Monticular\n\nSouth of about 150 20\'N, going from east to west, it\n\nshifts from small trnasverse structures, to thick, undifferentiated\n\nsandy tables, to a region of parabolic dunes and large fluviatie\n\nspreads of the souther base of the Air, and finally in the\n\nwest, around 60 E, we arrive at a hilly coalescent area. In\n\nlatitude, it extends beyond the border of Nigeria. In longitude,\n\nwest of 10\', itssirrounds the Tanout massif and extends 100 km\n\nupwind from it where it shifts to barely differentiated sandy\n\ntables, apart from triangular depressions pointing towards the\n\nwind and lined up along the line of the harmattan. Proceding\n\nsouthward to the latitude of the Koutous massif the eastern limit\n\nof the area with monticular structures extends a further 100 kim,\n\n\n253\n\ndownwind\n\nfrom the Koutous massif.\n\nb) Formation of the Monticular\n\nWe have\n\nnot yet succeeded in soling this problem and\n\n\nfor the time being we will only state some observed facts.\n\nA\n\n\nnorth-south cut, running from the N\'Kaba goulbi to the experimental\n\nunit shows that there is not a true sandy pad south of the N\'Kaba\n\ngoulbi, but, dominating the major bed of the goulbi, there is a\n\nsandy bank with a slope of 6-80.\n\nThis rises towards a sandy\n\n\nsurface shaped into a monticular landscape.\nunit is fouid on this sandy surface.\n\nThe experimental\n\n\nThe monticules which border\n\n\nthe bank are topographically a little more differentiated than\n\nthose of the experimental unit because their reactiuation -- ifn\n\nthe form of a buildup of an eolian cap -- is more advanced.\n\nThis fall is discontinuous, made up of a juxtaposition of\n\n/241\n\n\nsandy monticules separated by interdunal valleys, the bottom of\n\nwhich is sometimes at the level of the major bed of the goulbi,\n\nsometimes\n\nlightly higher.\n\nThese interdunal valleys and the up\xc2\xad\n\nwind slopes halfway upptheir sides have undergone eolian winnowing\n\nwhich has concentrated subangular quartz particles there, reaching\n\na size of 2-3 mm.\n\nWe even fouid a pebble here,(brought in by\n\n\nhumans?) measuring 2 cm in a depression at the level of the\n\ngoulbi, but outside of the major bed.\n\nBecause of the coarseness\n\n\nof the material, in particular of the subangular grains measuring\n\n2-3 mm, based only on ground observation, we rejected the notion\n\nof an eolian origin.\n\nUnfortunately, ground observation alon6,\n\n\nalthough supported by pedological analysis Cdifferent pedogenesis\n\nin this\n\nbank than in the rest of the unit), does not allow us\n\n\nto propose a hypothesis for the orgin of this material.\n\nWhat does one see on the ground?\n\n1. A winnowed surface on the interdunal valleys and on the\n\n\n254\n\nupwind slope.\n\n2. Immediately below this winnowed surface, in the material\n\nwhich is slightly solidified (not red but rather ochne) there is\n\na much finer material with larger fragments. But examination of\n\nthe terrain does not reveal ang 2-3 mm fragments which, however,\n\nshould exist, even itTin small quantities.\n\n3. The dunes are topped with homometric sand, well sifted and\n\ntypically eolian. Probably the fraction removed by eolian win\xc2\xad\nnowing to the base of the slopes and in the interdunal valleys is\n\nbrought to the top of the slopes during reactivation. This forms\n\na\n\nvery general mechanism of desertification.\n\nProblem: Monticules Formed by the Cutting Action of Water or\n\nPurely by the Wind\n\n\nin the Congb, which is also sandy, is cut\n\ninto similar monticules which are sometimes more differentiated.\n\nHowever, and this has never been doubted, it looks like a land\xc2\xad\nThe Bat6k4 Plateau\n\nscape cut by the action of water in a sandy mass.\n\nCan there be in these bank monticules interstratification of\n\nalternating fluviatile and eolian phases, both of them sandy?\n\nNote: the only pebble layers encountered are those of the\n\nMaradi quarries and the Tchadwa goulbi.\n\nIn summary, based on our present knowledge it is not possible\n\nto know whether or not water is involved in shaping the monticular.\n\nIf it is involved, what share does it play, what share is played\n\nby the wind?\n\nOnly two points are certain: not all of the material making\n\n/242\n\n\n255\n\n\nup the monticular is carried by the wind. There is reshaping of\n\na decomposition material 6f the Cretaceous substrate, probabty\n\nby water, and additions of much finer material brought in bT. the\n\nwind -- allochthon or of local winnowing -- which form the cap of\n\nthe monticule. At Maradi, alongtthe Maradi goulbi, the monticular\n\nconstitutes only a surface state on a system of terraces.\n\nThe Supply of Fluviatile Materi&& in the Experimental Unit\n\nAt present the experimental unit is very deficient in\n\nsurface runoff forms. However, several indicies suggest a past\n\nwhich had a more extensive drainage system:\n\na) Grain Size of the Material\n\nMany samples contain grains measuring > 2mm, i.e. too\n\ncoarse to have been deposited by the wind.\n\nThis is the case,\n\n\nin particular for the monticules in the experimental unit on which\n\nthe village of Azazala was bailt (NIG samples 77, 54 and 64).\n\nThis was also the case with the sandy pad south of the N\'Kaba\n\nIt is likely that these\n\ngoulbi (NIG samples 77 and 133-137).\ncoarse grains came directly from the local substrate of coarse\n\nsandstone of the Cretaceous period and are thus subautocht pne _\n\nor were deposited by fluviatile means.\n\nThe existence of a few gr&ins of potassium feldspar suggest\nthat material from the Precambrian stock south of the Niger\nRepublic has been Irought in by rivers on both sides of the Niger\nRepublic - Nigeria border.\nb) Morphoscopy of the Sandy Materials\n\nStudy 6f=the surface condition of the grains of sand\n\nreveals a mixture of two supplies of sand, one with rounded to\n\n\n256\n\nperfectly round, pitted-dull, not very largeggrains, and the\n\nother supply of coarser sand with subangular grains with rounded\n\ncorners.\n\nc) Analysis of Landsat 1 Satellite Pictures\n\nStudy of the Landsat 1 pictures, innparticular those of\n\nchannel 7, reveals\n\na dense network of low order valleys,\n\n\ntributaries of the left bank of the N\'Kaba goulbi.\n\n/243\n\n2. Discussion of the 1:20,000 Map of the Serkin Haussa \n\nExperimental Unit (Separate sheet)\n\nReactivation Mechanismssfor the Sandy Mantle by Wind\n\nand Water Erosion and\nThe 1:20,000 map\n\nof\n\nthe Effects of Human Occupation\n\nthe\n\nexperimental unit of Serkin\n\n\nHaussa (Niger Republic) was basically done to evaluate the\n\nreactivation mechanisms of the sandy mantle due toowind and\n\nwater erosion\n\nand to evaluate the effects of human occupation.\n\n\nIt was made from the special coverage of aerial photographs\n\n(1:10,000) taken by the French National Geographic Institute in\n\nOn this map it was attempted to make an inventory of the\n\norganization of different elements of the physical environment\n\n1976.\n\nand of the main parameters responsible for the breakdown of land\xc2\xad\nscapes.\n\nThese parameters are grouped into two categories:\n\n\n(1) borphological processes, among which we can distinguish\n\neolian reactivation either by an overloading of sand or by\n\ndeflation and water erosion, (2) human factors leading to a change\n\nin surface behavior.\n\nI. Surface State @f the Physical Environment\n\nThe sandy monticules and interdunal valleys were care\xc2\xad\n\n257\n\nIt was our htope,,by using a mapping format, to be\n\n\nfully mapped.\n\nable to discern an organization which we could not find by simply\n\nobserving aerial photographs and by making ground observations.\n\nBut the few rare tendencies which we were able to find are areas\n\nwhere the monticules are more numerous and, on average, separated\n\nby\n\nbstances of from 80 to 120 meters, and other areas where the\n\n\nmonticules are almost nonexistent, as is the case east of the\n\nvillage of Azazala in an extended region whereaall of the runoff\n\nseems to converge. The same is true south and northeast of\n\nSerkin Haussa.\n\nIt seems that outside of these three bands thermonticular\n\nhas densities roughly equivalent to the rest of the map. The\n\ngreatest density is located east of the village of Guidan Angb,\n\nfollowing a\n\nnorth-south line.\n\n\nThe interdunal valleys were differentiated from more or less\n\ntemporarily flooded depressions. We indexed 9 tabkis, which are\n\nnatural ponds often managed by man. They constitute the best\n\nwater reservoirs for 5 or 6 months after the end of the rainy\n\nseason.\n\nWe thought that these tabkis, in connection with the\n\n\nvalleys, had a subsoil of fine lateritic gravel.\n\nThis turned\n\n\nout to be practically never the case.\n\nWe were also struck by the rarity of such areas with a subsoil of lateritic gravel.\n\nStudies of the terrain reve&led only\n\n\nfour such areas: (1) 900 meters southeast of Guidan Lali Bakan6;\n\n(2) 400 meters north of Dan Diba; (3) 200 meters SSW fromthe\n\n&illage of Nafouty6;\n\nand (4) 800 meters WSW from Maya Darojia.\n\n\nThese four sites correspond to regions where surface runoff is\n\ndensest, and it goes from the diffuse to concentrated state. For\n\nsites 3 and 4, as also noted for the lateritic gravel quarry of\n\nMay Sokoni, outside the diagram one notes the existence of a\n\ndetectable underflow\nvegetation.\n\n\n258\n\n\nin the surface by means of denser lines of\n\n\n/244\n\n\nPonds flooded for a shorter period of time and wetter inter\xc2\xad\ndunal valleys\n\nwere also discerned.\n\nOne notes that their\n\n\nexistence is very often due to-surface runoff. By mapping them\n\nwe were able to mark two preferential regions, one to the west\n\nNNE-SSW diagonal, in the north passing\n\neast of Guidan Lali Bakan4, and in the south passing close to\n\n6f the map following\n\na\n\nMay -Sokoni;the second region is on the east of\n\nthe map.\n\n\nII. Biological Elements of the Enyironment\n\nOnly those elements were retained which affect wind or water\n\nreactivation, such as roughness due to vegetation (trees and shrubs)\n\nand termite nests, among which we tried to differentiate between\n\nclearly individualized termite nests and more or less spread out\n\nwell-established termite nests.\n\nIII. Human Environment\n\nThe study of aerial photographs reveals the distribution of\n\nthe habitat into concentrated villages separated by distances\n\nwhich vary considerably. Around these villages the agricultural\n\nsoil is divided into several surrounding rings:\n\n1. The ring in which man-made\n\ndegradation of the sandy soils\n\n\nis compensa,,ed for by the addition of animal manure.\n\n2. The ring divided up between agricultural soil occupied\n\nmainly by millet (the stands can be discerned bn aerial photographs\n\nas structure of aligned dotted lines) and fallow ground. One is\n\nstruck by the large proportion of cultivated area with respect\n\nto areas left fallow. In general, these regions show forms of\n\nwater erosion which have been left fallow.\n\n3. Among the other human factors represented are: hedges,\n\ncattle trails, roadsaand main highways.\n\n\n259\n\nIV. Morphological Processes for Breaking UP the Landscape\n1. Reactivation Due to an Overload of Sand\n\n\n/245\n\n\nAmong the eolian reactivation processes we have dis\xc2\xad\ntinguished reactivation due to an overload of sand.\n\nMany regions\n\n\nwith shrubs surrounded by a trapping ring of active sand were\n\nable to be distinguished.\n\nTheir abundance tends to prove that\n\n\nthere is transport and deposit of sand in the experimental unit.\n\nare subjected to mechanisms of band7-build-up by\n\n\nThe hedges\n\nthe combing effect.\n\nThis sand build up can cause the hedge to be\n\n\nraised with accumulations reaching 40 cm.\n\nIn exceptibnal cases\n\n\nwerwere also able to discern avalanche effects, i.e.ethe spreading\n\nout of sand beyond the hedge, perhaps at the expense of sand\n\ntrapped by the hedge.\n\nWhen trying to improve\n\nthe evaluation\n\n\nsystem it would be dangerous to remove the existing hedges, even\n\nwhen degraded or broken down hedges are involved, because this\n\ncould\n\nlead\n\ncould\n\neasily\n\nto the releaserof large quantities of sand which\n\nbe moved by\n\nthe wind.\n\n\nThe uprooting is probably local, since it exists around cer\xc2\xad\ntain large trees\n\nin deflation pits with excessive, asymmetrical\n\n\nwind scouring which can expose the roots of the tree (this was\n\nfound in the terrain).\n\nThis same transport of sand, the dangers of which are not\n\ninsignificant since it can exerb an\n\nabrasive effect on the young\n\n\nshoots, and these same avalanche effects can be detected around\n\nthe hedges.\n\n2. Reactivation by Eolian Deflation Processes\n\nWe have distinguished several types of deflation\n\n(1) area\n\n\ndeflation, i.e. in more or less extensive irregular areas; (Z)) ra\xc2\xad\n\n260\n\nter deflatiop, i.e. describing a dented topography when looked at\n\nin detail (dents or craters on the order of decimeters); and\n\nfinally (3) curious periodic or spot reactivation tendencies.\n\nThere is a distinct contrast between regions where water\n\nerosion predominates and regions where wind erosion predominates.\n\nWhy this contrast? What does it indicate?\n\nTheegegions where runoff is intense and which are less\n\nfavorable for the cultivation of millet are probably less over\xc2\xad\nIn these regions one also notes a larger amount of fallow\n\n\nused.\nground.\n\nElsewhere the areas most\n\nseem the most protected.\n\ndistant from the villages also\n\n\nIt is arouiid villages like Serkin\n\n\nHaussa and Azazala where wind erosion seems most advanced.\n\nIt is certain that there exists a very clear relationship\n\nbetween eolian reactivation and the growing of grain crops and an\n\ninverse relationship between water erosion and wind erosion.\n\n3. Runoff Effects and Other Forms of Water Eiosion\n\n/246\n\n\nWe have sjust seen that runoff does not add to the\n\nmechanisms of wind erosion unless -- but this cannot be revealed\n\nby examining aerial photographs -- the sand carried by the runoff\n\nwas of a size such that it could be taken up by the wind.\n\nThis\n\n\nwe willddiscover by granulometic studies.\n\nThereaare two regions where more intense runoff is becoming\n\nconcentrated: (1) east of Serkin Haussa and (2) north of a line\n\nextending from Azazala to Dieza Magajiya.\n\nAnother mechanism in connection with water occurs in certain\n\nareas abundant with extensive termite nests. This process we have\n\ncalled "glazing7" It results from a spreading out of muddy or fine\n\n\n261\n\nsandy substances making up the termite nests in rathbr flat\n\nregions and where rain waters and diffuse runoff give rise to\n\nareas bearing a film which is not conducive to vegetation.\n\nV. Man-Made Factors and the Vulnerability of Landscapes\n\nTwo series of human factors responsible for degradation of the\n\nlandscape have been distinguished:\n\n1. Those factors connected with the day to dgy activities\n\nand agriculture of the villagers, i.e. around wells, markets,\n\nschools and imileliet gRana2ies.\n\nThese areas of man-made denudation\n\n\nare generally located in the rig of fertilized ground\n\nsurrounding\n\n\nthe #ili ge.\n\n2. Those connected with the raising of livestock: the\n\nstamping of hoofs is such that it produces several types of de\xc2\xad\nnudation, linearly along the cattle paths and more spread out in\n\ncertain fallow areas in which threatening reactivation areas are\n\nappearing.\n\nConclusion\n\nAt the time of our first trip in January-February 1976 the\n\nexperimental unit looked to us like a region thredtend by eolian\n\nSubsequently, the rainy season which followed our\n\nfirst trip had particularly heavy rains, with the rains not\n\n\nreactivation.\n\nstopping until October.\n\n!O5r seconditrip in February 1977\n\nwhich\n\n\noltwed this season of abundant railis lead us to think that the\n\nreactivation mechanisms of the dunes observed in 1976 were\n\nreversible and that a good\n\nrainy season was sufficient to wipe\n\n\nout the bad effects of a series of dry years.\n\nStudy of the 1:10,000 aerial photographs, even though done\n\n\n262\n\nafter aagood rainy season, and the reactivation map of dunes\n\ncovered by natural or man-made mechanisms have led us to a more\n\npessimistic\n\nconclusion: in the context of demography measurements\n\n\nand current evaluation, any\nmethods\n\nattempts at improving the evaluation\n\n\ncannot be made without paying constant attention to\n\n\nthe mechanisms of wind er6sin, the effects of which are shown in\n\nthe experimental unit.\n\n3. Experimental Unit: The Village and Its Surrounding Rings\nof Agriculture; the Means of Cultivation; the Notion of a\n\n\n/247\n\n\nMobile Sandy Covering\n\nAround the villages the agricultural soil is laid out in two\n\nor three rdhfgs.\n\nTheifirst, immediately around the village, is\n\n\ngenerally cultivated in sorghum and corn, which, because they are\n\nmore demanding than millet, benefit from manure.\n\nThe addition to\n\n\nthe soil of cattle manure makes an excellent protection against\n\nwind erosion. The natives are very conscious of the fact that the\n\nmanure compensates for deflation when the latter reaches too high\n\na level close to the villages.\nappears\n\nIn the 4erial photographs there\n\n\na form of risible deflation south of\n\nthe village of\n\n\nGuidan Gouge like a smaltlepro6syipf slightly depressed round\n\nareas in whibh the covering of vegetation is destroyed.\n\nAt\n\n\nGuidan Goug&\'this degradation was compensated for by a manure of\n\ncamel dung and a covering of twigs.\n\nThe second ring, further out, is planted with millet which is\n\ngenerally harvested in October, the beginning of the dry season\n\nwhen the harmattan blgins to blow.\n\nAt Maradi, where the harmattan\n\n\nblows, on average, from October to February inclusive,, the winds\n\nfrom the east are strong and the millet, once harvested, no\n\nlonger provides a protective covering. In general, it is in this\n\nsecond ring cultivated in millet, sometimes also planted with .\n\n"nieb6," that the dangers of wind erosion are greatest. These are\n\n\n263\n\n\nincreased by an 2imroverishment of the soils around certain\n\nvillages due to 20 consecutive years of cultivation without ever\n\nletting the land lie fallow, which seems surprising in an\n\nespecially quartzy sandy material.\n\nSeveral inquiries among the peasants made us aware of a notion\n\nwhich had escaped us during the first year of our work: the notion\n\nof a mobile sandy covering.\n\nIn fact, good ground planted with\n\n\nmillet is a very mobile sandy graund.\n\nThe red clastic dunes and\n\n\nthe interdunal spaces richer in muddy material are considered by\n\nthe natives to be much less favorable to the cultivatdon of millet.\n\nWhen the cultivation of crops &xtends for too many years the\n\nmobile sandy covering can be completely carried away by\ndeflation and the B horizons crop out.\n\neolian\n\n\nThen, in order to avoid a\n\n\ncatastrophic drop in production, the natives have recourse to\n\nletting the land lie fallow, allowing the mobile sandy cover to\n\nreform.\n\nThus, southwest of Guidan Lali Bakan4, a very hard region,\n\n\nwhere the B horizon crops out, was left fallow for three years\n\nwhile waiting for the qand carried by the wind and trapped by the\n\n/248\n\n\ngraminaceous covering to become thickneneugh to again allow\n\nprofitable cultivation of millet.\n\nThe peasants appreciate the\n\n\nsand brought in by the wind ("good for theecultivation of millet"),\n\nbut, on the other hand, they fear deflation which causes thb\n\nelastic sandy substrate to crop out.\n\nThe mobile sandy covering favors keeping things moist.\n\nIt is\n\n\nunder this mobile sandy covering that the chances of finding mois\xc2\xad\nture at a shallow depth are maximum during the dry season. When\n\nthere is no covering of mobile sand the cultivation of millet is\n\nonly profitable in years of heavy precipitation.\n\nThe thickness of the mobile sandy covering varies: 5 cm near\n\nthe Serkin Haussa Gakoudi trail; on the top of dunes it cancreach\n\n\n264\n\n\nOjtrIGNAL PA-Gb la\nOF pOOR QUALITY\n\n/249\n\nNatural Wind and Water Erosion Mechanisms and Their Evaluation\n\nDegradation of\nWith Respect to the Niger Republic\n Sandy Landscapes\n\nLong\nWind a u- CIUl~r Water\n\nors\nfac-\n\n" dificatioi\toz surs\nor\n\nSurface\n\nconditions\n\nInl\n\nta\n\ns___\n_\n\nn\n\ngr\ng\nn dina].\nle\nation\nandftzrGullys \t n\n_trm\nan deflatlo\n\nct\n\ns\n\nt=\n\nan made actions\n-\xc2\xad maopsn...\nItnor:\nAverage7 ma)or. 4\nenvrn,\ndeli~l~Lbreakdown\nof Land\n\npreserve\nn-\n\nby\n\n_scape \t\n\nRocky outcroppings\nimpregnated with \n\n\n\' i brA -r\n\noveruse\n\n\niron outcro~ppins\nRoky\nValleys\nPonds\nSandy fluviatile\ndistribution\n\n-\n\n\xc2\xad\n-\n\n--\n\nSubstrate sprankled\nwith a light film\nof sand\n\nThick sandy\ncovering\n\n\nHollowed out \t\nforms \n\n\n-\n\nSANDY STRUCTURES\nGiant waves\n\n-\n\no..8.\n\n./:".4... \t\n\nwo\n\nHonticular\n\nVP\n\n- *""-\xe2\x80\xa2-,,,\n\n.... \t\n\nLongitudinal \t\nircnticular\nTransverse \t\n\n\'\n\nA\n\n"\n\n\nT1:111P8\'~\n\nTAT.\n\nGiant monticulars\n\nin transverse\nalignment\nLocation of the\n\nmonttcuiar\n\n\n"\n\n\nLimit of Landscape breakup due\n\nto man-made actions ,"\n\n-,\n\n\n\'\n\n\nx X\n\ncoalescent hills\n\nDispersed hills\n\n..\nI\n\nTransverse hills\novold hills\n\n0\n\ne el-\n\nTransverse (actual\norientation) \t\n\n\\e\\\\\n\nSmall transverse\n\na\n\nTransverse with\n\n\'a\n\ntrangular inter-\n\ndunal depressions\nt\n\nTransverse with\ndispersed tra-\n\nangulardepresaxonq\n\n\\\\\\\n\\\n\n\nA\n\n,\n\n\nAd\n\nAn\n\nA\n\nArid border of\nthe \tSahelA\n\n265\n\nNatural Wind and Water Erosion Mechanisms and Their Evaluation\n\nWith Respect to the Degradation of Sandy Landscapes\n\nNiger Republic\n\nM...o\n\nSurface\nconditions\n\n1\'2dlac-W\nCE\norrac Song Pr\nideflatiodel\nor\n\nRocky outcroppings\nimpregnated with\n\n\' s -\n\nnd\nWind qtio\n\n.\n\n-\n\nWater\nnn__ tion\n\'an04\nGullys\n\nCicl.\nd hrl\n\n-- Man made actions --- __/2\nMajor:\nMinor: - Average:\nof\n- breakdown\npreserve, nv.ron\nscape by\noveruse\n\n1.\n\nV\n\niron\nRocky outoroppings\nValleys\nPonds\nSandy fluviatile\n\n.*\n\n~\n\n--\xc2\xad\n\ndistribution\n\n-...\n\n--\n\nSubstrate sprinkled.\n\nwith a light film\n\nof sand\n\nThick sandy\n\ncovering\n\nV\n\nV.\n\n\nHollowed out \n\nforms\nSAIDY STRUCTMRES\nGiant; waves\n\nMonticular.\n\nt\n\nLongitudinal\nmonticular\n\n*%\n\n09\n\nll\n\ns7\n\n!/\n.Jtt\n\nTransverse\n\nYVf1\n\n*L~\n\nmonticular\n\n**\n\nGiant monticularS\nin transverse\nalignment\n\nLocation of the\n\nmonticular\n\nLimit of Land\xc2\xad\nscape breakup due\n !/\nto man-made actions\nCoalescent hills\n\n*\n\n\nDispersed hills\n\n*.,\n\n\nXX\n\nTransverse hills \n\nOvoid hills\n\n,\n\n-\n\nTransverse (actual\norientation)\nSmall transverse\nI\nTransverse with\ntriangular interdunal depressions\nTransverse with\ndispersed triangular depresEmbnj\nArid border of \n\n\n1I\nI\n\nI\n\n\\\n\n\\o\\\\\n\n\\\n\na4\n\n\nA0\n, 4.40.6\n\n4J\n\n0\n\n1\n\nn06\n\nA\nA\n\nA\n\n0\n\n4\n\n6A\nN\n\nPerson in Charge: Monique Mainguet\n\nIn Collaboration with Lydie Canon, Anne-Marie Chapelle\n\nLaboratory of Regional Physical Geography\n\n7\n\nUniversity of Reims\n\n57, rue P.

The band of gullied\n\ndunes forms a true transition between the two landscapes. In this\n\nregion the precipitation levels (from 250 mm to 400mmm in the south)\n\nare sufficient to cause runoff and the dovering of vegetation\n\nis\n\ninsufficient to counteract it.\n\n\narea are-- of two sorts: old rounded gullies\nand more distinct gullies, probably more recent. These gullies\naffect two kinds of covered eolian structures: hilly and transverse\nThe _gulliesin this\n\nstructures.\n\n266\n\n\nThe\'map of this band (1:1,000,000 scale map) and\n\nits comparison with the isohyet map show that water erosion on\n\nsandy mantle is less effective with precipitation levels\n\nof 600 mm than with from 250 to M00 mm of precipitation.\n\n\nthe\n\nIn the experimentAl unit water erosion takes place only in\n\npreferential locations governed by pedological factors of dif\xc2\xad\nferentiation.\n\nIn fact, the gullies only appear=in areas, or on\n\n\nthe periphery of areas, with a subsoil of lateritic gravel or in\xc2\xad\ncipient hardpan, and on reddened dunras, thus with a slightly\n\nelastic mass, when they are subject to "glazing" as a result of\n\noveruse which has caused deflation of their mobile sandy mantle.\n\nThis glazing promotes the start of in-tensaeunotff\nThus on the\n\nbasis of the postion of areas with lateritic ggavel or of red\n\ndunes it is possible to easily predict water erosion dangers in\n\ndifferent regions of the experimental unit.\n\nHowever, the danger\n\n\nof water eetosion is still not very high.\n\n2.\n\n2. Wind Reactivation\n\n/251\n\n\nThere are four wind reactivation mechanisms: (1) up\xc2\xad\nrooting,((2) erosion, (3) sprinkling With sand and avalanche\n\neffects, and (4) buildup of small structures such as nebkas or\n\nsilks.\n\nThe\n\nreactivation signs o~served differ according to the\n\n\nscale of the documents referred to.\n\nA. Diagnosis of Reactivation Using Satellite\n\nPictures\n\nThe following can be detected on the 1:1,000,000\n\nscale ERTS pictures:\n\n1. Circalar deflation: areas of reactivation onomonticular,\n\nlongitudinal monticular and transverse structures.\n\nA structure\n\n\n267\n\n\nof central white areas, 2-4 km in diameter, sometimes coalescent,\n\nshows up particularly cblearly on channel 7.\n\nThe black central\n\n\npoint corresponds to the village and the surrounding ring of\n\nfertilized ground. The white ring surrounding the village cor\xc2\xad\nresponds to cultivated agricultrual ground.\n\nThus the reactivation\n\n\nconnected with the villages and agricultural soils can be\n\ndetected on satellite pictures.\n\n2. Longitudinal deflation: reactivation occurs\n\nalong the\n\n\nstreaks, but in a discontinuous way whibh makes it difficult to\n\ndetect on\n\n1:50,000 scale aerial photographs and easier to detect\n\n\non satellite pictures.\n\n3. Two types of eresion._(.)\n\nin stria on the dunal structures,\n\n\nsometimes arising downwind from an obstacle, or (2) in sweeping\n\nbands downwind\n\nfrom the Koutous and Tanout-imassifs.\n\nThe sweeping\n\n\nbards often describe an arc of a circle, while the erosion stria\n\nare rectilinear.\n\nTheir edges, which are always sharply defined on\n\n\nthe northside and wavy on the southside, are dissymmetrical.\n\nThe small sweeping bands are shaped (in top view) like a spearhead\n\ntapering downwind, whereas the large bands taper without reaching\n\na perfect spearhead shape.\n\nOn the Tessaoua-Zinder road which\n\n\ncrosses the eolian sweeping bands can be seen hilly dunes at the\n\nedge of the bands and monticular dunes in the center. The sub\xc2\xad\nstrate is rocky with hardpan phenomena.\n\nThe bands are located\n\n\ndownwind from the Tanout and Koutous massifs. Downwind from the\n\nKoutous Massif which blocks the passage of sand the longer erosion\n\nband reaches a length of 230 km with a width of 25 km. Shorter\n\nerosion bands form below the Tanout Massif, tapering downwind.\n\nDeflation streaks extend the erosion bands of the Koutous and\n\nTanout massifs, north and south of the Koutous Massif and at the\n\nnorthern beginning of the alveolar.\nrules governing their location.\n\n268\n\nWe still donnot understand the\n\n\nHuman occupation begins where\n\n\nthese deflation streaks stop, hence the site 6f the experimental\n\nsquare was well chosen.\n\nWhi\' the erosion bands are unattractive regions for farmers\n\nbecause the rocky substrate crops out in these areas without any\n\nsandy covering, the\n\ndeflation streaks are not unattractive areas\n\n\nas is shown by the region south of Tarka valley west of Dakoro.\n\nB.WWiAid Reactivation: Study of Aerial Photographs\n\n7252\n\n\nNo region, no matter what the dunal relief char\xc2\xad\nacterizing it, seems to be sheltered from current reactivation\n\nphenomena.\n\nHowever, the highest frequency of\n\nthese phenomena\n\n\nis found on the transverse structure which skirts the Koutous\n\nMassif.\n\nThis may explain the concentration of reactivation phe\xc2\xad\n\nnomena in this region.\n\n1. Wind Reactivation and Topographical Factors\n\nWind reactivation often arises downwind from a\n\ntalus, from a trail and from wadidbeds.\n\nWe found it in these\n\n\nplaces on the 1:60,000 scale aerial photographs of 1975 in 2\n\nforms:\n\n(1) in streaks running ENE-WSW obliquely to the wadi beds,\n\n\nalways lcated west of the beds, i.e. downwind from the beds;\n\nor (2) extending\n\nthe end section of the bed of the wadis,\n\n\nbroadening the area affected, which seems to have a tendency to\n\nmove\n\ntowards the west in ring-like or finger-like progressions.\n\na) Reactivation Seems to be promoted by the\n\n\npresence of valleys:\n\n1. for the region extending from 41030 \' \n\nto 150 N and from\n\n6030\' to 7\'50\'E there is a correspondence with the Koren Adwa,\n\nthe Afagag, the Eliki and the Goulbi N\'Tarka.\n\n2.

To verify the existence of the large transport current\ntransporting particles from Bilma to Ader Doutchiby showing the\ndecrease in grain size in the direction in which the sand is\nmoved, by showing the existence of load substitution phenomena\nand by showing the degrees of wear on the sandy particles.\n2. To locate the material in the experimental unit along\nthis current.\n3. To specify the degrees of allochthony and/or autochthony\nor the mixtures of distanit and local supplies of sand in the\nsandy material.\n4. To study the existence of a single current or several\nadjacent currents as apparently indicated by the satellite\npictures.\n5. To specify the range of particle sizes of particles\nsubjected to deflation and saltation transport during dunal\nreactivation.\n6. To specify the size of particles according to the type\nof sandy structure which they form.\n7. To investigate differences in grain sizes of the material\naccording to its depth in order to determine variations in\n\nplacement processes, for example superposition of a stratumformed\nby dominant water actions by a~stratum formed by dominant wind\nactions\nThree kinds of laboratory analyses were done on the samples:\n\n(4l\n\n/259\n\n1.

Qdphi > 0.40.\n\nAt Termit Kaoboul thl ,svalue corresponds\n\n\nto the foot of the downwind face of the ripple mark (NIG 76C4lc),\n\nand in the Fachi Bilma Egg, upwind from Termit, it corresponds\n\nto sand taken from a depth of 10 cm.(NIG 76 49).\n\nThese for\xc2\xad\n\nmations are therefore very heterometic.\n\n2. 0.25 < Qdphi < 0.40 for the sands &D the depressions, sub\xc2\xad\nstrate and sandy substrate at a depth of 10 cm of a ripple mark\n\nat Termit Kaoboul (NIG 76 39c, d( e), and sands of the Fachi Bilma\n\n\n275\n\n\n,,-toa\n\n0,\n\ni\n\ntl il\n\n1 ll Y,\nitl\n\nIa\n\na\n\nkO-\n\nft\n\n0 54\n\nEtS\n\nS\n\nS\'\n\nt)\n\nr0\n\nerg taken from a depth of 20 cm (NIG 76 46).\n\nAgain these for\xc2\xad\n\nmations are rather poorly sorted.\n\n3. 0 < Qdphi < 0.25. Since we were not able to keep in a\n\nsingle group formations with Qdphi numbers as different as 0.05\n\nand 0.25, we subdivided this last group. Since no limit shows\n\nto\n&femred make an arbitrary separation based\nup on the graph, we\non a calculation of the arithmetic mean of this last group.\n\nThe\n\n\ncalculated mean being 0.13, we thus have:\n\na) a Qdphi group > 0.13 for the very red and movable\n\nsands of the top of the Termit knoll (NIG 76 37) and the sands\n\nfalling downwind from the same knoll (NIG 76 38); the sands of\n\nthe top, slope and train of a Termit Kaoboul nebka ( NIG 76 40 a,\n\nb, c); those of a front side ftndoconvex back side of a Termit\n\nKaoboul ripple mark (NIG 76 41 a and b); the red sands at the\n\nfoot of the slope of a cave=in at Termit Dole (NIG 76 50); the\n\nsands of the levee on the western bank of Lake Chad (NIG 76 52);\n\nand finally the sands of an existing nebka of N\'Guigmi (NIG 76\n\nThis material can be considered to be moderately sorted.\n\n53).\nb) A group with a Qdphi number less than or equal to 0.13.\n\nThis pertains to the front and back side of a Termit Kaoboul\n\nripple mark (NIG 76 39 a and b), the reactivation silks of Termit\n\n(NIG 76 42 and 47) which reveal the infrequency of effective winds,\n\nwhence excellent sorting or a very limited range of efficiency.\n\nThis group also includes the paving of large waves (NIG 76 45 and\n\n48), the dunes in the vicinity of N\'Guigmi (pedogenic sands)\n\n(NIG 76 51, 57 and 58); existingredeposition sand at N\'Guigmi\n\n(NIG 76 56); and finally the Tall dunes (NIG 76 54).\n\nIn this\n\n\nlast area the wind has lost some of its energy and after\n\ncrossing the low-ling obstacle represented by Lake Chad it\n\nimmediately deposits its, sand. The material of these samples\n\ncan be considered homometric and well sorted.\n\n\n277\n\nFig. 63.

Surface winnowing\n\n/263\n\n\nof the Fachi Bilma erg, since the\n\n\nparticles which remain by forming a paving are better sorted than\n\nthe particles at a depth of 20 cm.

The granulometric composition of existing structures\n\n(nebkas, sand4hich has-fallen downwind from the Termit knoll)\n\nwhich are relatively well sorted but less than the reactivation\n\nsilks of the Fachi Bilma erg.\n\nB. Comparative Values of the Mode and Median (Fig. 63)\n\nWe know\n\nthat the difference between the mode and the median\n\n\nreveals the degree of homometry of a mobile formation.\nlarger this difference,\n\nThe\n\n\nthe more poorly sorted, i.e. heterometric,\n\n\nis the formation and vice versa.\n\nFig. 63 enables us to rather quickly evaluate this differencev\n\nLet us draw a bisecting line which connects the angles of the\n\nsquares drawn in: the more distant the points, the greater the\n\nmode-mediat difference. Nevertheless, this distance must be\n\nevaluated in relative terms. In the range of high values a\n\nmoderate difference will correspond to a large difference for the\n\nlow values.\n\nBy using this method -- which is imperfect because it would\n\nbe necessary to precisely define the relativeness described above -\xc2\xad\n\n279\n\n\nwe\n\ncan distinguish several groups:\n\n1. A group with little or no difference.\n\n\nAmong the samples of fine sand this includes the sands of\n\nreactivation silks (NIG 76 42 and 47), the red sands at the foot\n\nof a caved in slope at Termit Dole (NIG 76 50), the sands of\n\ndunes close to N\'Guigmi (NIG 76 51, 55, 57 and 58), existing\n\nredeposition sand NtGuigmi (NIG 76 56) and finally the sand\n\nof the active dunes of the Tal (NIG 76 54).\nAll of these samples\n\nhave a mode of 160 pm &ndaa median of 150 Pm.\n\nAmong the samples of coarse sand this groups includes the\n\nsand of the front side of a ripple mark at Termit Kaoboul (NIG 76\n\n41 a) with a mode and median ef 800 pm.\n\n2. A group with a moderate difference.\n\n/264\n\n\nAmong the samplesodf fine sand the following sands can be\n\ndistinguished:\n\na) sometimes nebka sands, the nebka slope at Termit\n\nKaoboul (NIG 76 40 b) whose mode and median are 160 pm and\n\n205 Pm; the top and train of the Termit Kaoboul nebka (NIG 76 40 a\n\nand c) whose mode and median are 315 pm and 250 Vm; and finally\n\nthe N\'Guigni nebka (NIG 76 53) Those mode and median are 250 pm\n\nand 200 pm.\n\nb) Sometimes ripple markssands, like that of Termit\n\nKaoboul, taken from a depth of 10 cm (NIG 76 39 e), or agains\n\nlike that taken from the giant waives of the Fdchi Bilma erg at a\n\ndepth of 10 cm (NIG 76 49) whose mmode and median are. T5 and\n\n250 pm.\n\nc) And finally sometimes sands from the levee which borders\n\nthe western bank of Lake Chad (NiG 76 52) hwhose mode and median\n\nare 250 pm and 200 pm.\n\n\n280\n\n\nAmong the samples of medium sand the following sands can be\n\ndistinguished: ripple mark sands, front and back side of a\n\nTermit Kaoboul ripple mark (NIG 76 39 a and b) and that of a\n\nripple mark on the giant wave of the Fachi Bilma erg (NIG 76 45)\n\nwhose mode and median are 630 pm and 550 Pm.\n\nAmong the samples of coarse sand the following sands can be\n\ndistinguished: surface pavement sands of a ripple mark on a giant\n\nwave of the Fachi Bilma erg (NIG 76 48) whose mode and median are\n\n800 pm and 720 pm.\n\n3. A group with a large difference.\n\nAmong the\n\nsamples of fine sand the following can be dis\xc2\xad\n\ntinguished:\n\na) Sometimes ripple mark sands at a depth of 20cm in the\n\nFachi Bilma erg (NIG 76 46).\n\nb) Sometimes sands from the top part of the eolian pass\n\nat the foot of the Termit knoll (NIG 76 37).\n\nc) Sometimes sands from the base of an eolian fall at\n\nthe foot of a slope (NIG 76 38).\n\nAll of these samples ahave a\n\n\nmode and median of 315 pm and 200 v\'m\n\nrespectively.\n\n\nAmong the samples of medium sand the following can be\n\ndistinguished: sands from the\n\nhollow and substrateCof a Termit\n\n\nKaoboul ripple mark (NIG 76 39 c and d) whose mode and median are\n\n630 pm and 450-285 Pm respectively.\n\nAmong the samples of coarse sand the following can be\ndistinguished: sands\n\nof the back convex side of a Termit Kaoboul\nripple mark (NIG 76 41 b) whose mode and median are 1,250 Pm and\n850 pm; also sands from the base of the front side of the same\nripple mark (NIG 76 41 c) whose mode and median are 800 and\n350 pm.\n\n281\n\nThis graph yields two results:\n\n1. A classification of material according to its grain size\n\nand its degree of heterometry.\n\nParticularly coarse (with a\n\n\nmode and median 5 70UOpm) are the pavements either arranged\n\nor not arranged in ripple marks, and particularly fine (mode\n\nand median\n\n35QOand 400 pm) is the material which is currently\n\n\nbeing moved (nebkas and silks).\n\n2. As for homometry, the most homogeneous material is that\n\nof the pavement of the erg which is a residue of winnowing and\n\nthe southernmost material taken at Maine Soroa.\n\nThe redeposition\n\n\nsand is also relatively homogeneous.\n\n/266\n\n\nC. Comparis!on of Figs. 62 and 63\nBy comparing the groups distinguished in the two cases and\n\nthe formation to which hthese groups belong we will be- able to\n\nverify and confirm the more or less large degree of homometry of\n\nthe material.\n\n- The best sorting is attained by samples from group "d"\n\nof Fig. 62 and group "a" of Fig. 63.\n\nThese are the reactivation\n\n\nsilks downwind from the Fachi Bilma erg (NIG 76 42 and 47) the\n\ndunes in the Chillia Dillia north of N\'Guigmi (NIG 76 51), the\n\nactive dunes of the Tal (NIG 76 54) and finally the material\n\ndeposited downwind from Lake*Chad in a very southern\n\nbranch of\n\n\nthe harmattan (N!G 76 55, 56, 57 and 58).\n\nThen, in decreasing order of sorting, come the following:\n\n- The formations belonging either to group "tc"\n\nof Fig. 62\n\n\nand group "a" of Fig. 63, or to group "d" of Fig. 62 and \'roup\n\n"b" of Fig. 63. These are the front and back sides of Termit\n\n\n282\n\n\nKaoboul ripple marks (NIG 76 39 a and b and 41 a), a red formation\n\nat the foot of a Termit Dole cave-in slope (NIG 76 50) and the\n\nripple marks on the large waves of the Fachi Bilma erg (N!G 76\n\n45 and 48).\n\ng The formations belonging to group "c" of Fig. 62 and\n\ngroup "b" of Fig. 63. These are the nebkas of Termit Kaoboul\n\nand N\'Guigmi (NIG 76 40 a, b, c and 53) and the sand of the\n\nlevee bordering Lake Chad (NIG 76 52).\n\n- The formation belonging to group "c" of Fig. 62 and\n\ngroup "c" of Fig. 63. These are the sands of the top of the fall\n\nof the Termit knoll (NIG 76 37 and 38) and the convex back side\n\nof a Termit Kaoboul rippl6 mark (NIG 76 41 b).\n\n- The formations belonging to groups "a" and "b" of Fig. 62\n\nand group "b" of Fig. 63. These are the substrate at a depth\n\nof 10 cm of a Termit Kaoboul ripple mark (NIG 76 39 _) and a\n\nripple mark on a large wave of the Fachi Bilma erg at a depth of\n\n\n10 cm (NIG 76 49).\n\n- Finally, the formations belonging to groups "a" and "b" of\n\nFig. 62 and group IVc of Fig. 63. These are the hollows, substrate\n\nand front side base of Termit Kaoboul ripple marks (NIG 76 39 c\n\nand d and 41 c) and a sample taken at a depth of 20 cm in a wave\n\nof the Fachi Bilma erg.\n\n/267\n\nIn summary, the best sorted material is that which results\nfrom current deposits: the reactivation silks of the Fachi Bilma\n\nerg and the material deposited along the southern most current\n\nwhich crossed Lake Chad. In both cases the effectiveness of the\n\nwinds is small, on the one hand because effective winds are rare\n\nsince the region is now experiencing a wet period, and on the\n\nother hand because on the path of the harmattan Lake Chad acts\n\na\n\n283\n\n\nas an obstacle or brake and-reduces the effectiveness of the\n\nwind.\n\nThe fineness of the material and the fact that it is well\n\nsorted downwind from Lake Chad makes this region particularly\n\nvulnerable to reactivation, and thus the area is to be worked\n\nwith caution.\n\nThe most heterogeneous material is that of the Fachi Bilma\n\nerg. Despite winnowing by the wind which it is subject to, the\n\npavement of the erg remains rather poorly sorted.\n\nGranulometric Studies of the Sand of Silks (NIG 76 42 and 47)\nand of Waves (NIG 76 45 and 48).\nSilks are the Reactivation\n\nDunes of\n\n/268\n\n\nthe fixed Fachi Bilma Erg in the Termit Region.\n\n\nWe find the following:\n\n1. Very similar shapes of frequency curves and cumulative\n\nfrequency curves. The frequency curves are unimodal and very\n\nstraight, especially those for NIG samples 76 42 and 48.\n\nThe\n\n\nfirst part of the NIG 76 45 curve is less straight and the end\n\nsection of NIG 76 47 curve is less straight. This Is reflected\n\nby the Qdphi values: NIG 76 42 = 0.04 (silk), NIG 76 45 = 0.07\n\n(wave), NIG 76 47 = 0.09 (silk), NIG 76 48 = 0.05 (wave).\n\nNevertheless, these four Qdphi values reflect good sorting of the\n\nmaterial.\n\n2. Basic differences concerning the size of the material.\n\nThe mode of the silks is 160 pm and the mode of the waves is\n\n630 and 800 pm.\n\n3. Differences between the two silks and the two waves. The\n\nsand of silk NIG 76 42 is certainly a perfect example of material\n\n\n284\n\n\nwhich can be easily moved by\nmaterial has a size\n250 Pm.\n\nthe wind --\n\nmore than 60% of the\n\n160 Pm and no grains are greater than\n\nThe sand of silk NIG 76 47 is less characteristic.\n\nEven\n\n\nif 30% of the material is < 160 pm, 8% of the material ranges\n\nin size between 160 and 315 Pm.\n\nThe wave NIG 76 I5 consists 46% of sand with a grain size\n< 630 pm, and 6% of this material is finer: <250 pm.\nThus\nthere exists a supply of predominantly coarse sand mixed with\na supply of fine sand, less abundant but still there.\nthe sand of wave NIG\nis\n\nBy contrast,\n\n76 48 is exemplary: 58% of the material\n\n> 800 Pm and there is no material < 4000pm.\n\nIt is a\n\npavement which is perfectly winnowed by the wind.\n\nOnly the\n\ncoarse material remains in place; the fine material is carried\nawaysby the eolian current downstream fromth e functional eolian\nunit.\nComparative Values of the Mode and Qdphi (Fig. 64)\n\n/270\n\n\nIn Fig. 64 we have assembled all of the samples taken from\n\naround Termit, Tanout and Maradi.\n\nThis gr\n\nh has two advantages:\n\n(1) it enables a comparision\n\nof grain sizes and brings to light a progression in sizesfrom\n\nT5rmit to Maradi by considering the mode and Qdphi and (2) it\n\nquantifies the susceptibility of each sample to wind corrosion.\n\n1.

In the Termit region the reactivation silks (NIG 76 42 and\n\n47) the dunes in the Chillia Dillia (NIG 76 51) and the sands\n\ndownwind from Lake Chad (NIG76 55, 56, 57, 58).\n\n/271\n\n\n2. In the Tanout region, the nebkas (NIG 76 78 and 80), the\n\ncurrently mobile sands (NIG 76 26, 27, 28 and 76) and from\n\nmaterial sampled at at depth of 10 cm in a megaripple planted with\n\nmillet (NIG 76 75).\n\n3.

Quantification of Susceptibility to Wind Erosion\n\nThe samples with a small mode (160 Pm) and small Qdphi\n\n(homometric) are the most moveable by the wind. They can easily\n\nbe inventoried:\n\n1. In the Thrmit region, the reactivation silks (NIG 76 42\n\nand 47), a\n\nformation at the base of a cave-in slope (NIG 76 50),\n\n\na dune in the Chillia Dillia (NIG 76 51), andactive dune of the\n\nTal (NIG 76 52), the sands deposited downwifid\n\nfrom Lake Chad\n\n\n(NIG 76 55, 56, 57 and 58) and the slope of a hebka (NIH 76 40 b).\n\n2. In the Tanout region, the currently mobile sands (NIG 76\n\n26, 27, 28 and 76), the nebkas (NIG 76 78 and 80), the samples\n\ntaken at the top (NIG 76 86), at a depth of 10 cm (NIG 76 91)\n\nand at a depth of 20 cm (NIG 76 25) in the separate dunes.\n\n3. In the Maradi region, the material at the bottom\n\nof a\n\n\nwell (NIG 76 20), a sample taken from a depth of lmm 20 cm in a\n\ndune of the Maradi goulbi (NIG 76 66),\n\nsandy knolls,(NIG 76 69,\n\n\n70, 71 and 73) and a hebka (NIG 76 72).\n\nAdding up the weiglts of the grains measuring 160 pm of\n\nthe samples listed above we obtain the following:\n\nAbsolute weight\nin grams\n\nRelative weight with respect\n\nto the total weight of ma\xc2\xad\nterial sampled, in %\n\n\nTermit region\n\n15.38\n\n\nTanout region\n\n310.55\n\n13.50\n\n\nMaradi region\n\n288\n\n430.78\n214.80\n\n13.42\n\n\nRoufidness Coefficient, Plotted Against Grain Size (Fig. 65, 66\n\n/272\n\n\nand 67)\n\nIn the Termit sector the roundness coefficient increases in\n\nproportion with the increase in grain size up to atlimit of\n\n630 Um and then it decreases.\n\nHowever\n\nthere is one exception:\n\n\nthe pavement of the giant waves of the Fachi Bilma erg (NIG 76 48)\n\nwhose roundness coefficient at a grain size of 800 pm is 248.\n\nIn the Tanout sector the roundness coefficient increases\n\nin proportion with the increase in the size of the grains. But\n\nthe threshold has dropped to 315 pm. Thus, this indicates that\n\nthe grains transported by the wind up to Thnot ae smaller than\n\nthose at Tfrmit.\n\nIn the Maradi sector it seems that the roundness coefficient\n\nincreases up to a threshold size of 250 pm. But the large drop\n\nwhich occurs at a size of 200 I1m and the small number of data\n\nfor the 250 m size may allow the threshold to be located at 1\n\n\n160 Pm.\n\nThus the decrease in the size of the grains transported by\n\nthe wind as the distance covered increases is confirmed. Termit,\n\nTanout and Maradi are located along the same current of eolian\n\nsand transport. Upstream, at Tirmit, just at the start of the\n\nSahel, large allochthonous grains have been carried in. At\n\nTanout, in the interior of the existing Sahel, there are no\n\ncoarse allochthonous grains. Only medium-sized grains have been\n\ncarriediin. At Maradi, in the southern portion of the existing\n\nSahI&, large and medium-sized allochthonous grains are rare; only\n\nsmall grains which could be transported by the wind up to that\n\npoint have a high roundness coefficient.\n\nAll of this data is represented quantitatively in the following\n\ntable:\n\n289\n\n\nSize of particles in\nin pm\n\nMean of roundness coefficients\nTermnt\n\nI Tanout\n\n-.\n\nadi\n\nNamy\n\n125\n\n146,6\n\n160\n\n151,6\n\n200\n\n163,1\n\n250\n\n169,5\n\n168\n\n315\n400\n\n178.5\n\n186,5\n185,5\n\n184,4\n\n174,5\n153\n\n500\n\n224,5\n\n176\n\n159\n\n171,6\n\n630\n\n2V836\n\n163\n\nI1912 \n 157\n117\n\n\n157\n\n\n800 \n\n\n125o\n\n148\n\n159,3\ni\n\n70\n\n59\n\n\n188,4\n\n139,9\n\n\n175\n\n1552\n\nj\n\n159\n\nLaboratory analysis of the sandy material collected in 1977\nin the experimental unit explicitly confirms the results pro\xc2\xad\n\n/273\n\n\nvided by the sample collected at the time of the first ttlp:\n\nthe curves are trimodal.

Monticular dunes with:\n\na) a mobile sandy covering which is essential to the\n\nvariety of millet currently being planted within the boundaries\n\nof thb unit.\n\nb) sandy material with a large variety of grain\n\nsizes below the mobile sandy covering. This material is more or\n\nless clastic or solidified. When it crops out as a result of\n\ndeflation it is not donducive to the cultivation of millet.\n\n\n303\n\n\n2. Regions of tabkis or temporary ponds, more abundant in\n\nfine particles, in particular muds, an often supported by a\n\nlayer of lateritic gravels.\n\na) The monticular structures are, above all, the site\n\nof small-scale eolian shifts.\n\nb) The tabkis are the site of water\n\nactivity: light\n\n\nto moderate runoff.\n\nc) Along with "a.\n\nand "b" there is a third mechanism:\n\n\nglazing phenomena in connection with termites. The role of\n\ntermites is important since thby help in the assimilation of\n\nmillet and sorghum straw, but they concentrate the organic residues\n\nand the finest materials by taking them from the soil as a whole.\n\nslight changes introduced in the relatively simple\n\n\nThe\n\nmorphology have to do with soil formation, which in turn is\n\ngoverned by the topography.\n\nThe hydromorphic pseudogley soils\n\n\npertain to the interdunal valleys, and the soils whibh have\n\nbeen slightly solidified as a result of a type of tropical,\n\nferruginous soil formation -- impoverished or leeched soils -\xc2\xad\npertain to the tops and slopes of knolls.\n\n1\n\nBecause of their defficiency in organic matter, their\n\nrelative lack of structure with respect to monticular dunes and\n\nthe poor water dynamics with respect to certain tabkis and inter\xc2\xad\ndunal valleys, all of these soils are unstable: some with\n\nrespect\n\nto wind dynamics, and others with respect to water\n\n\ndynamics.\n\n1. In the chalky Champagne region Renard has shown that the per\xc2\xad\ncentage of organic matter had to be maintained at 4%. Below this\n\nlevel wind and water erosion occur. In Champagne, nearly all\n\nof the beetroot greens and straw and corn stalks, after they have\n\nbeen ground upp are burried in the ground.\n\n\n30~4\n\n\nTwo facts should\n\nbe noted: \n\n\n/288\n\n1. Because of the increasing density of population the\n\noccupation of ground in the experimental unit is nearly at its\n\nmaximum-\n\nMost of the surface area is being used for growing\n\ncereal grains, especially millet and sorghum, and to a slightly\n\nlesser extent corn and\'hiebe."\n\nThe only areas not being cul\xc2\xad\n\ntivated are those which have undergone "glazing,\' and the\n\ntemporary ponds and endoreic basins like tabkis which are\n\nricher in muds and perhaps in clay (examined in the laboratory).\n\nThese last areas are reserved for pasturing; the population\n\ndensity no longer allows ground to be Tet fallow.\n\nThus if\n\n\none wants to continue breeding animals the remaining pasture\n\nland cannot be converted into cultivated ground.\n\n2. In spite of the impossibility of increasing the cultivated\n\nareas and in spite of the decrease in yields experienced by the\n\nfarmers, nevertheless it is necessary to nourish an ever\n\nincreasing population. One way to ease the situation would be\n\nto use plowing. In particular, the fertilizers should be organic\n\nin order to help bind the soil.\n\nMillet tolerates poor soils.\n\n\nThe selection of natural fertilizer sites is based on the\n\ndegree of structural defficinecy of the soils around the villages.\n\nThe problem of working the soil when using plows:\n\nDeep working of the soil is preferable as soon as possible\n\nafter the harvest because:\n\n1. Dirt clogs can thus harden, allowing them to remain\n\nintact and making them less sensitive to deflation.\nth\n\nThis is not\n\n\ncase in a situation where the gcound is sorked dry.\n\n2. The turning under of stubble is also done before the\n\n\n305\n\ntermites can get to it who concentrate organic matter and fine\n\nmineral salts in their nests. On this point, however, opinions\n\nare divided because\n\nit has not been shown that the burying of\n\n\nstubble protectis it from the termites.\n\n\n3\n\n3, Trampling of the ground by animals eating stubble.\n\n\nis avoided.\n\nDiffiulties encountered after the stubble has been turned\n\nunder:\n\n1. In Muslim countries the stubble is the primary material\n\nuseddin the construction of the walls and roofs of huts and field\n\nenclosures. There are no quarries or rocks to supply material for\n\nconstruction and cement is rare and costly.\n\n2. During the dry season the stuble helps fill the gap to\nfeed the animals.\n\nWhen the natives find that the land around\n\n\ntheir villages is breaking down too much, i.e. that eolian\n\nreactivation is becoming too intense, they call in the herds.\n\nThere are manure contracts between animal raisers and farmers,\n\nherds to eat the stubble. The peasant,\n\nfaced with the trampling-plus-natural-mantre option, chooses the\n\n\nthe latter allowing the\nnatural manure.\n\n\nIn 1976 the rainy season had abundant rains which\n\nN.B.:\nlasted into October and broke the record set in 1932. This was\n\nfollowed by a distinct decrease in eolian phenomena such as\n\n"pick-up, transport and deposit in the form of nebkas."\nOnly\n\nsaltation seems\n\nto persist.\n\n\nThe Mobile Sandy Covering\n\nThe mobile sandy covering is extremely important for\n\nthe millet.\n\n306\n\n\nActually\n\nthe seeds are placed at the base of this\n\n\n/289\n\n\ncovering.\n\nIn addition, because of its lack of structure it\n\n\nhelps to better preserve the moisture.\n\nIf the branches of the wind reach the solidified horizon the\n\nsoil becomes less favorable for millet and the natives are forced\n\nto let the ground lie fallow while waiting for the mobile sandy\n\naovering to form again.\n\nThe samples taken by us from the surface and at low depth\n\nin the experimental square and those taken by the soil scientist\n\nC. Feau from holes are in perfect agreement.\n\nOn the whole they\n\n\nall show two princip l modes modes: 160 pm and 315 pm. Sometimes\n\na third mode appears, 100 Vm, but it is much less pronounced.\n\nAnalysis of these samples leads to the following fundamental con\xc2\xad\nclusion: if one compares the sample taken from the surface to\n\nthat taken from a low depth, one finds either an increase in the\n\nmode to 315 pm or a gradual increase from the 315 pm mode to a\n\n400 pm mode. This indicates a relative enrichment of the surface\n\nwith material > 315 pm and proves irrefutably that the finest\n\nmaterial < 315 pm has been carried away. Thus the 315 pm mode\n\nis a threshold with respect to existing eolian transport, iee.\n\nthe reactivation of the sandy mantle. The granulometric curves\n\nshow that the material < 315.Pm can reach and exceed 80%.\n\nExamination of material from hebkas -- small sandy arrows which\n\n\nare formed at certain seasons downwifid from an obstacle (aastalk\n\nof millet, for example) -- produceg the same findings.\n\n\nThe existence in sandy sediments of a supply of coarse\ngrains > 500 pm consisting in part of round, dull grains of\neolian origin is evidence of paleoclimatic winds, which were\nstronger than existing winds and carried in some of the sandy\nmantle in the experimental unit. (With respecttto this pre\xc2\xad\nceding period we are now in a wet phase.)\n\n/290\n\n307\n\n\nHowever, the abundance of fine particles ( 315,.pm), in this\n\nmaterial means that the experimental unit is everywhere vulnerable\n\nto eolian mechanisms.\n\nSwept by the wind, the sand can be\n\n\ndeposited on the top of the highest monticular dtnes, trapped by\n\nthe hedges which rise up or yet a-ain by the villages which\n\ncreate obstable effects.\n\n(This explains the striking fact of the\n\n\nfreshness, homcmetry and the quality of sand in the villages;\n\nduring each dry season it is actually renewed by eolian trans\xc2\xad\nport.)\n\nAs we have already said, vulnerability to water erosion\n\nrepresents a relatively small, non-threatening danger. The only\n\nregions affected by runoff are located around endorheic basins\n\nand ponds.\n\nThe 1:20,000 scale map of the experimental unit that we\n\nhave drawn up shows how much the entire experimental unit has\n\nbecome unstable. This is still very difficult to estimate at\n\nthe present time, however, it is a real phenomenon.\n\nThis map\n\n\nalso shows the overwhelming extent of grounds occupied by crops\n\nand the small amount of area left fallow.\n\nThe farmers are drawing\n\n\nattention to a drop in production which they attribute to the\n\nlack of fallow ground.\n\nNearly everywhere there are signs of reactivation of the\n\nsandy mantle, as is especially brought to light by the study of\n\nthe aerial photographs obtianed during the special mission.\n\nThese signs are less prominent in the rings of ground fertilized\n\nwith animal manure around the villages.\nholding firm,\n\nbut their existnee constitutes a warning bell!\n\n\nfor future planners, since\nirreversible traumas.\n\n\n308\n\nThese areas are still\n\n\nimproper managemeht could cause\n\n\ntG1-og6aidryf Scientific and Technical Terms tUsed\' \n\n\n/291\n\nAblation: Removal of material.
