b'N92-22688\nFORCE LIMITED VIBRATION TESTING\n\nTerry D. Scharton\nJet Propulsion Laboratory\nCalifornia Institute of Technology\nPasadena, CA 91109\n\nABSTRACT\nA new method of conducting laboratory vibration tests of spacecraft equipment has been developed\nto more closely simulate the vibration environment experienced when the spacecraft is launched on a rocket.\nThe improved tests are tailored to identify equipment design and workmanship problems without inducing\nartificial failures that would not have occurred at launch. These new, less-destructive type of vibration tests\nare essential to JPL\'s protoflight test approach in which laboratory testing is conducted using the flight\nequipment, often one-of-a-kind, to save time and money. In conventional vibration tests only the input\nvibratory motion is specified; the feedback, or reaction force, between the test item and the vibration\nmachine is ignored. Most test failures occur when the test item goes into resonance, and the reaction force\nbecomes very large. It has long been recognized that the large reaction force is a test artifact which does not\noccur with the lightweight, flexible mounting structures characteristic of spacecraft and space vehicles. In the\nnew vibration tests, both the motion and the force provided to the test item by the vibration machine are\ncontrolled, so that the vibration ride experienced by the test item is as in fright. Reaction force limiting has\nbeen used successfully at JPL in three vibration tests of flight instruments during the past year, and it is\nanticipated that the new technique will be widely employed soon at JPL and eventually throughout the\naerospace industry.\nINTRODUCTION\nThe acceleration input specified in a vibration test of aerospace hardware typically exceeds the\nrelevant flight input for several reasons. Figure 1 illustrates the relative effects of smoothing, enveloping and\nadding margins to flight vibration data. The test specification tends to smooth, or average, over the\nfrequency variations in the flight data because these variations depend on the details of the flight mounting\nand attached hardware. A consequence of this smoothing is the elimination of flight data interface\nacceleration notches which may be caused by the large reaction forces at resonances of the attached\nhardware. These innocuous looking notches are very important because vibration testing with a smoothed\nacceleration specification may result in overtesting at the resonance peaks of lightly damped test items by up\nto a factor of one-hundred. (The factors discussed in this example are applicable to linear amplitudes of\nvibration. For spectral densities, square the factors; for dB levels, take twenty times the log of the factors.)\nIn most cases the effect of not notching the acceleration test spectrum overshadows the effects of enveloping\nthe flight data to account for spatial, flight-twilight, and other variations, and of applying margins to the\nflight data for design and test. Enveloping factors are typically in the range of two to three, which generally\ninclude the 95th percentile. Design and test margin factors range from one-and-a-quarter to two; the Jet\nPropulsion Laboratory (JPL) uses one-and-a-half.\nFigure 2 illustrates a zoom analysis of the frequency dependence of force and accelerations at one of\nthe notches shown in figure 1. The force at the interface between the mounting structure and the test item,\nthe interface acceleration, and the response acceleration of the test item are plotted as functions of frequency\nfor both flight and vibration test mounting configurations. The interface acceleration is notched in flight but\nsmooth in a conventional vibration test, as discussed previously. The interface force increases moderately at\na test item resonance in flight, as the interface acceleration notches down. The interface force increases\ngreatly at a test item resonance in a vibration test with constant interface acceleration. The ratio of interface\nforce to interface acceleration is the same in flight and in a test; the ratio is given by the test item apparent\nweight which has a peak at the test item resonance. The response acceleration of the test item has the same\n\n105\n\nfrequency dependence as the interface force; in fact, the response is equal to the interface force times the\ntest item modal mass for the resonance. The plots in figure 2 show that for flight mounting, the interface\nforce increases to a limit value at resonance and the interface acceleration decreases from a limit value.\nLimiting the interface force in a vibration test (that is the force delivered to the test item by the shaker) is\nequivalent to limiting the test item response at resonances.\nTHEORY\nThe following exact relationship for the dual control of shaker acceleration and force has been the\nsubject of several recent investigations [1-7]:\n1 = A/Ao + F/Fo\n\n(1)\n\nwhere A is the acceleration of the source, Ao is the source free acceleration, F is the force between the\nsource and load, and Fo is the source blocked force. The quantities in Eq. 1 are complex functions of\nfrequency and it is difficult to predict or measure the associated phase angles. It may be seen from the\nresults in [5] that the interface acceleration A and force F may both exceed the respective free Ao and\nblocked Fo values at the resonances of the coupled system. Therefore, the magnitudes of these quantities do\nnot obey equation 1, but equation 1 is satisfied when phase is taken into account [5].\nA more useful relation for vibration testing is the extremal dual control equation [1,4]:\n[A[ < Aland\n\nIF[ < F1\n\n(2)\n\nwhere A1 and F1 are limit magnitude values appropriate to a vibration test specification. To be useful for\nextremal control of a shaker, Eq. 2 must be applicable at all frequencies and particularly at the coupled\nsystem resonances where as shown in [5] the free acceleration and blocked force are not adequate limits. It\nis essential that the acceleration limit A1 and force limit F1 in Eq. 2 be chosen so that the respective coupled\nsystem values are enveloped.\nFORCE SPECIFICATIONS\nThere are a number of approaches available for defining the force limit [6,7] in Eq. 2. Herein, the\nsource impedance method [2,4 & 7] is described. The acceleration limit in Eq. 2 is that normally used to\nspecify a conventional hard-base-drive vibration test, i.e. the envelope of the interface acceleration between\nthe source and load. In a random vibration test the acceleration specification is the spectral density As in\nG**2/Hz. In the source impedance method, the corresponding force spectral density limit is calculated as\nthe product of the acceleration specification As and the square of the source effective mass Ms in lb mass.\nIf the measured force in the test set-up includes the force used to move a test fixture of mass Mr, the\nappropriate total force spectrum Fs in lb**2/Hz is:\nFs = As * [Ms**2 + Mr**2]\n\n(3)\n\nwhere it has been assumed that the fixture force and load force are 90 degrees out of phase at load\nresonance (see Fig. 13 of [4]).\nThe force spectrum calculated using the source impedance method will in general differ from that\ncalculated more accurately using the method in [6] or the two-degree-of-freedom\nmethod in [7]. The correct\nway to calculate the force is to multiply the load mass M2 times the load acceleration A2, whereas with the\nsource impedance method the source mass M1 is multiplied times the source acceleration A1. The factor\nneeded to correct the source impedance force spectrum is the product of the ratio of mean-square (or peak)\nload to source responses times the ratio of squared load to source masses. For M2/M1 <0.4, the source\n\n106\n\nimpedance method yidds force,s larger than the two-degree-of-freedom method and is therefore conservative\nfor qualification purposes (see Fig. 3 in [7]). For M2/M1 > 0.4, the source impedance method becomes\nunconservative for qualification, and the more exact calculation methods of [6 and 7] must be used.\nAn extremal control approach, similar to that described in [4], can be used to automatically\nimplement force limiting. In the extremal approach, the shaker control system compares several\nmeasurement channels with appropriate reference spectra and adjusts the shaker drive until one channel is\nequal to the reference and the other channels are equal to or less than their references. When one channel\nis force and the other is acceleration, the extremal dual control approach of Eq. 2 is automatically\nimplemented.\nUnfortunately, most shaker controllers, induding JPL\'s, currently provide for only one\nreference spectrum.\nFigure 3 shows the flow diagram which can be used to implement extremal dual control with existing\ntest equipment. Channels 1 and 2 are redundant control accelerometers in the shake direction and channel 3\nis the force transducer signal. $1 and $2 are the control accelerometer charge amplifier sensitivities in\nvolts/g, Sf is the force transducer charge amplifier sensitivity in volts/ib, and $3 is the pseudo-accelerometer\nsensitivity in volts/g input to channel 3 of the controller. The one-third octave spectrum shaping fdter gain\nsettings are calculated from $3, Sf, and the acceleration As and Force Fs specifications as shown in Fig. 3.\nThe effective source mass Ms can be measured as a function of frequency with a modal impact\nhammer, if the mounting structure of the test item is available. Alternatively, the source mass can be\ndetermined from a finite element model of the mounting structure. Data must be obtained in each of three\ndirections at each of the mounting points. The raw data will show peaks and valleys associated with antiresonances and resonances. The effective mass is a smooth curve through the data. Foster\'s theorem says\nthat the effective mass is a decreasing function of frequency [8]. If a finite element model is used, the\neffective mass is the sum of the modal masses of all modes with resonant frequencies at and above the\nfrequency of interest. The total effective mass in each direction is calculated by summing the masses at each\nof the attachment points.\nTEST RESULTS\nA vibration retest of a spacecraft flight instrument, the Mars Observer Camera (MOC) was\nconducted using force limiting [9]. The MOC is a principal investigator supplied instrument being built by\nthe California Institute of Technology Division of Planetary Sciences for Arizona State University. The\nMOC instrument is part of the JPL Mars Observer spacecraft configuration scheduled for launch in 1992.\nFigure 4 is a schematic of the MOC configured for a vertical axis vibration test. The MOC consists of an\nf/10 reflector telescope with approximately a 14" aperture and a graphite epoxy tube approximately 30" in\nlength. The camera also includes a wide angle lens assembly located along one side of the tube.\nThe test fixture consisted of a 2" thick, 18" diameter, 50 lb aluminum plate to which the MOC was\nattached at three mounting feet as shown in Figure 4. The input acceleration was controlled using the\nextreme of two control accelerometers mounted on this fixture plate. Four triaxial piezoelectric force\ntransducers (Kistler model 9067) were sandwiched between the fixture plate and a 2", thick 20" diameter\nshaker base plate which was attached to the shaker head. To enable the transmission of shear forces across\nthe transducers in the lateral tests, the force transducers were preloaded axially to 8400 lb with a 1/2"\nthrough bolt torqued to 70 ft-lb. The outputs of the four force transducers in the test axis direction were\nsummed to provide total lateral shear or vertical force. In the horizontal axis tests, the vertical direction\noutputs of the two transducers further from the shaker were summed and multiplied by two to estimate the\ntotal vertical moment force. The summed transducer output was attenuated by a charge amplifier to\naccommodate the high sensitivity force transducers. The output of the charge amplifier was sent to a onethird octave spectrum shaping network and the shaker controller for force limiting as described in Figure 3.\n\n107\n\nThe MOC vibration test was conducted in JPL\'s environmental\ntest facility during the two day period\nJanuary 19 and 20, 1991. After some initial difficulties setting up JPL\'s data acquisition system to record the\nforce data and trouble shooting accelerometer\nchannels, the tests went smoothly.\nThe additional\ntime\nassociated with implementing\nthe force limiting technique for the first time was saved by not having to\ncalculate and implement manual notching.\nThe fact that a complicated three-axis test was completed in two,\nadmittedly long, days speaks to the efficiency of the technique.\nThe MOC was well instrumented\nwith\naccelcrometers\nand the response data at critical locations was analyzed between runs before going to higher\ntest levels. The MOC passed the test without any structural or performance\ndegradation.\nFigure 5 shows the measured\nvertical force in the minus 18 dB vertical random vibration\ntest without\nand with force limiting. Also shown is the force specification\ncalculated from Eg. 3 by taking the f_ture plus\nmounts (squared mass) times the acceleration\nspecification\nand subtracting 18 dB. The force limiting\nreduced the force peak at 285 Hz by about 9 dB. However, some off-resonance\nresponse below 100 Hz is\nalso reduced.\nFollowing the -18 dB run, some adjustments were made to the force specifications\nby changing\nthe one-third octave filter gain settings; specifically, the non-resonant\nforce limiting below 100 Hz was\neliminated\nand the amount of force limiting at the first resonance at 285 Hz was increased.\nFigure 6 compares the control acceleration spectrum for the full level vertical random vibration test\nwith the 0.2 G**2/Hz\nspecification.\nThe force limiting resulted in approximately\na 15 dB notch at the\nfundamental\nresonance at 285 Hz. Notice that the 285 Hz notch is a gradual ramp down and a sharp step\nincrease corresponding\nto the mirror image of the force excess of the specification\nin Fig. 5. This\nasymmetric\nnotch shape is a characteristic\nof the force limiting approach.\nIt is believed that this notch shape\nis more representative\nof flight than the symmetric\nnotches typically used in manual notching to limit\nresponse acceleration\nto calculated\nlimit loads. The notches at 400 and 630 Hz were put in by increasing\nthe\nfilter gain in these one-third octave bands after the -12 dB run in order to keep the acceleration\nresponses at\ntwo critical locations under the limit load levels. Unfortunately,\nthese resonances were masked by the large\nforce required to move the 50 lb fixture, so that the notches are one-third octave wide instead of being\nnarrower in width like the resonances.\nCONCLUSIONS\nForce limiting has been utilized successfully\nat JPL in three vibration\nof which was the MOC described herein.\nIn each case, the test item received\n\ntests of flight instruments,\none\na softer ride than it would\n\nhave in a conventional\nvibration test with only acceleration\ncontrol. However, the author is convinced\nthat\neach test was a realistic representation\nof the flight environment,\nplus some margin. Force limiting offers a\nrational means of eliminating\nthe costs and schedule delays associated with both overdesign\nand overtesting\nin aerospace\nand automotive\nindustries.\nWide spread application of force limiting will require more experience and flight force data to develop\ngeneric force specifications.\nTechniques for predicting the overturning moments in lateral axis tests and for\ncombining the effective masses at multiple mounting points are needed.\nImproved force gage mounting\nmethods are needed to alleviate the disadvantages\nof having large test fixture mass between\nthe force gages\nand the test item. Finally, new vibration\ntest control systems need to incorporate\nthe capability\nof specifying\nseparate references for each control channel; a feature currently offered by only one major manufacturer.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENT\n\nInstitute\n\nThe research described in this paper was carried out at the Jet Propulsion\nof Technology,\nunder a contract with the National Aeronautics\nand Space\n\n108\n\nLaboratory, California\nAdministration.\n\nREFERENCES\n.\n\n2.\n\n.\n\n,\n\n,\n\n.\n\n,\n\no\n\n.\n\nT.
