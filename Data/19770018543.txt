The anemometer consists of a silicon cantilever beam 2.5 millimeters long, 1.5 millimeters wide, and 0.25 millimeter thick with\nan integrated diffused strain-gage bridge, located at the base of the beam,, as the forcemeasuring element. The dynamics of the beam are like those of a second-order system\nwith a natural frequency of about 42 kilohertz and a damping coefficient of 0. 007. The\nanemometer can be used in both forward and reversed flow. Measured flow characteristics up to Mach 0.6 are presented along with application examples including turbulence\nmeasurements.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThis report describes a miniature drag-force anemometer, consisting of a cantilever beam with attached strain gages, which is capable of measuring dynamic velocity\nhead and flow direction. The instrument was developed because the assortment of\navailable instruments for determining dynamic flow quantities such as total pressure\nand velocity is limited and because measuring time-varying phenomena has become increasingly important in the developmental testing of airbreathing engines and their components.\nThe major types of dynamic flow diagnostic instrumentation in current use are\nminiature pressure transducers, mounted either in probes or duct walls, hot-wire and\nhot-film anemometers, and laser anemometers.\nLaser anemometers are being used, to a limited extent, in applications where survey probes are impractical. Laser anemometers are used, for example, in transonic\nflows where probe blockage is excessive and in velocity surveys in the passages between rotating blades. High cost and the requirement of optical access have limited\nthe application of laser anemometer systems.\n\nHot-wire and hot-film anemometers are also used to determine dynamic velocity.\nHowever, these instruments have a number of serious shortcomings. When used in\ncompressible flows where density and temperature variations are not negligible, the\nanemometers require an elaborate calibration, and, even with a complete calibration,\ninterpretation of results is difficult. Wire breakage and change in calibration due to\nflow contamination and/or corrosion are also problems. Each anemometer channel\nalso requires an elaborate electronics package. The drag-force anemometer has the\npotential of overcoming some of the shortcomings of the hot-wire and hot-film anemometers. It is more rugged than a hot-wire anemometer, its calibration is simple and\nunaffected by flow contamination, and associated electronics are as simple as those of\nstrain-gage pressure transducers.\nThe earliest reported use of the drag-force anemometer for dynamic flow measurement took place in compressor rotating-stall experiments (ref. 1), in which the natural\nfrequency of the beam was 5 kilohertz. A different kind of anemometer was reported\nin reference 2. It consisted of an ogive-shaped body surrounding a piezoelectric element and was used to measure turbulence profiles in the wake of a circular cylinder in\nwater. The instrument was capable of measurement at frequencies up to 1 kilohertz.\nIn the work described in this report an anemometer similar to that of reference 1\nwas used except that the natural frequency of the beam was much higher. The beam\n(which is commercially available) is silicon with an undamped length of 2. 5 millimeters and a thickness of 0.25 millimeter. A four-arm strain-gage bridge is bonded to\nthe beam by solid-state diffusion techniques. The natural frequency of the beam in the\nfirst bending mode is about 42 kilohertz. This report describes the anemometer and\nits performance in subsonic flow. A brief discussion of initial applications is also included.\n\nDESCRIPTION AND PRINCIPLE OF ANEMOMETER\nDescription of Anemometer\nA photograph and a drawing of the drag-force anemometer used in this investigation\nare presented in figures 1 and 2, respectively. The silicon beam has an unsupported\nlength of 2.5 millimeters with the outer 1. 5 millimeters exposed to the flow. The\nwidth is also 1. 5 millimeters, so the element exposed to the flow is a square plate\nwhich is 0.25 millimeter thick.\nWater cooling passages in the region near the base of the beam allow the anemometer to be used at moderately elevated temperatures. The diffusion-bonded strain gages\nat the base of the unsupported length (fig. 3) are capable of operation at temperatures\n\nup to 120\xc2\xb0 C. The water cooling also aids in minimizing stresses due to differences in\nthermal expansion between the silicon beam, the supporting metal, and the epoxy film\nwhich bonds the beam to the supporting metal.\nThe two longitudinal gages shown in figure 3 are the active gages which are either\nin tension or compression depending on to which side of the beam the flow is directed.\nTwo transverse strain gages complete the Wheatstone bridge, and because the gages\nare near each other, the device is inherently temperature compensated. Because silicon is brittle like glass, the anemometer is fragile, and care is required in handling.\n\nPrinciple of Operation\nVelocity head measurement. - The drag force on the beam for flow normal to the\nbeam surface is given by\n\n(1)\n\nFor constant beam area A, and constant drag coefficient C\xe2\x84\xa2 the drag force D is\nproportional to the velocity head plr/2, where p and U are fluid density and velocity,\nrespectively. Flow direction nomenclature is given in figure 4. (Symbols are defined\nin appendix A. ) The variation of the flat-plate drag coefficient with several parameters\nis shown in figure 5 (from ref . 3). Figure 5(a) shows that the drag coefficient is insensitive to flow angle for angles within about 45\xc2\xb0 of normal to the beam surface. Figure 5(b) shows that effects due to variation in Reynolds number are negligible for Reynolds numbers greater than 10 000. As shown in figure 5(c), effects of variation in Mach\nnumber are small (within 5 percent) for Mach numbers less than 0.75. However, at\ntransonic Mach numbers, variations in drag coefficient are not negligible and cause a\nnonlinear relation between drag force and velocity heat. (The Mach number sensitivity\nshown in fig. 5(c) is for a two-dimensional (or an infinitely high aspect ratio) plate,\nwhereas the rest of the results of fig. 5 are for square plates. ) Figure 5(d) shows that\nincreasing the turbulence intensity from nearly zero to 5 percent results in a 5- percent\nincrease in drag coefficient.\nIt should be noted that the drag- force anemometer can measure either forward or\nreversed velocity head. However, velocity can only be obtained from the velocity head\nwhen variations in density are negligible.\nFlow direction measurement. - If the beam is oriented so that the flow is nearly\nparallel to the beam surface (fig. 4), the drag coefficient is proportional to flow angle,\nas shown in figure 5(a). (Strictly speaking, the term "drag coefficient" should be re-\n\nplaced with "lift coefficient" in this region. Hence, in this operating mode the dragforce anemometer would be more properly called the lift-force anemometer.) The\noutput of the strain gage for this case is proportional to both flow angle and velocity\nhead; so, when flow direction is measured, either two beams must be used or a single\nbeam must be rotated to two positions (flow nearly normal to and flow nearly parallel\nto the beam surface). An alternative method of determining flow angle sensitivity is an\nin situ calibration which can be done if the anemometer is mounted in an actuator which\ncan be rotated to known angular positions.\n\nSensitivity\nFor a rectangular beam of thickness t and width w, the strain at a point on the\nsurface of the beam is\nstrain =J>1_\nEwt 2\n\n(2)\n\nwhere T is the bending moment at that point, and E is the Young\'s modulus of the\nbeam material. The electrical output is proportional to the strain at the point where the\nbridge is located.\nFor the beam described in this report, the strain gages are centered at a distance\nZ-, (fig. 6) from the fixed end of the beam, and the part of the beam L - Z\xc2\xab *s exposed\nto the gas stream. If G is the electrical output per unit strain per volt of excitation,\nthe signal per volt of excitation is\n3CDG pu2 r\n99Z\n\nET\n\n2l\n\n2\n\nL\n\n2\n\n1 J\n\nThe derivation of equation (3) is given in appendix B.\n\nNatural Frequency and Damping Coefficient\nThe drag-force anemometer is a simple plane beam, supported at one end and free\nat the other. Its motion can be described by the wave equation for thin beams (ref. 4),\n\n2\n\n9T2\n\nwhere y is the displacement of the beam from its equilibrium position, T is time, x\nis the distance measured from the fixed end of the beam, and\nc = t/\xe2\x80\x94\n\n(5)\n\nin which E is Young\'s modulus, p\' is the mass per unit length of the beam, and I\' is\nO\nthe area moment of inertia of the beam cross section, wt /12.\nEquation (4) may be solved by letting\ny(x,T)=X(x)e(T)\n\n(6)\n\nSubstituting equation (6) into equation (4) gives the equation for 0 in the form\n*\n\ndr\n\nA\n\n(7)\n\n2\n\nso that theoretically the frequency response of the beam is that of an undamped secondorder system, with circular frequency u>. When the equation X(x) is solved (for details see ref . 4), the natural frequency in the first bending mode is\n\nf =\n\n= 0.1615-- *\n\n(8)\n\nwhere p is the density, the mass per unit volume.\nIn contrast to the situation for an ideal beam, there is a certain amount of damping\npresent. The amount of damping is characterized by the parameter \xc2\xa3, called the fraction of critical damping or the damping coefficient. It is equal to zero for an ideal\n(undamped) system and has the value 1 for a system which is critically damped.\nThe two parameters which characterize the beam, f and \xc2\xa3, can be measured by\nusing a spectrum analyzer. For a lightly damped second-order system, such as the\ndrag-force anemometer considered in this report, the frequency spectrum of the straingage bridge signal is relatively flat at low frequencies, rises to a maximum at a frequency f111 3.X, and finally drops off at higher frequencies . This is true as long as the\n\nbeam excitation can be characterized as a white noise source, a source whose spectrum\nis continuous and uniform as a function of frequency.\nLet f ~ be the frequency below f_ Q .- at which the amplitude is down 3 decibels\nIJJcwC\nfrom its value at \xc2\xa3__\xe2\x80\x9e_ and fT be the frequency above f____ at which the amplitude\nIHcLX\nIHclX\nis down 3 decibels from its maximum. The analysis given in appendix C shows that \xc2\xa3\nand fn are related to the location and width of the peak by\n\n1=^\xe2\x80\x94^\nmax\n\n(9)\n\n*max\n\n(10)\n\nand\n\nfn=\n\nVl - 2?2\n\nFor highly underdamped beams, f\n\nand f max are essentially equal.\n\nCHARACTERISTICS OF ANEMOMETER\nBasic Flow Characteristics\nThere are three basic flow characteristics of the drag-force anemometer: The\nfirst is the sensitivity of the anemometer to velocity head when the flow is normal to the\nbeam surface. The second is the variation in the output due to any misalinement from\nthe normal condition. The third is the angle sensitivity when the anemometer is used\nto measure flow direction.\n5\nFigure 7 illustrates the sensitivity to velocity head for values up to 0. 25x10 newtons per square meter. The data were obtained in an ambient-temperature free jet.\nThe maximum value for the velocity head shown corresponds to a Mach number of about\n0.6. The sensitivity calculated from equation (3) and the manufacturer\'s nominal catalog value for the output of the strain-gage bridge on the beam (45 mV/V at 1000 micro\xe2\x80\x94fi\nstrains (1 microstrain = 10" m/m)) was 15 percent greater than that obtained experimentally. This small disagreement is not unreasonable and could easily be due to\ndeviation in the bridge sensitivity from the nominal catalog value. Also, the exposed\nportion of the beam is not of the exact same geometry as that for which the drag coefficient data of reference 3 were obtained. No attempt was made to calibrate the beam\nwith known weights or loads because each anemometer should be calibrated in a flowing\n\nstream. Such a calibration would include effects of local flow acceleration in the region of the beam tip. For reversed flow, the sensitivity is the same magnitude as that\nof figure 7 but with a negative sign.\nThe anemometer is quite insensitive to angular misalinement about an axis passing\nthrough the beam support for nearly normal flow incidence, as shown in figure 8 (/3\nvariation). The output voltage is essentially constant over a range of 0 of \xc2\xb120\xc2\xb0 from\nnormal. However, variation in output voltage with variation in a is not negligible, and\nan approximate value for a must be known to ensure adequate accuracy in velocity\nhead measurement (see fig. 4 for definition of a and /3).\nAs indicated by figure 9, when the anemometer is used to measure flow direction,\nit is highly desirable to orient the beam so that a. is the angle of measurement. For\na measurement the longitudinal strain gages (fig. 3) are either in compression or\ntension, and the transverse gages are not under strain, so that a workable sensitivity\ncurve is obtained. However, if the beam is oriented so that /3 is the angle of measurement, a more highly nonlinear and asymmetrical sensitivity curve is obtained. The\nasymmetry is probably due to the contribution of the transverse gages as the beam is\nsubjected to a torque during 0 variation.\nThe slope of the a sensitivity curve of figure 9 is approximately the same as a\ncalculated slope based on the curve of figure 5(a). With the beam and tip geometry\nused, the stall region (fig. 5(a)) on the a curve does not occur until the flow angle is\ngreater than 50o . The curves of figure 9 are for a velocity head of 0.1x10 5 newtons\nper square meter. The output voltage at a given flow angle is proportional to the\nvelocity head.\nThe small output at zero flow angle is due to the fluid dynamic force on the edge of\n1\nthe beam, which causes a slight strain in the strain gages at the base of the beam (the\nedge thickness is 1/6 of the width).\n\nFrequency Response\nThe drag-force anemometer response is that of a highly underdamped secondorder system with a high natural frequency. The natural frequency is 41. 8 kilohertz,\nand the damping coefficient is 0. 007. These were measured with a spectrum analyzer\n(fig. 10), as explained in the section Natural Frequency and Damping Coefficient. A\nsmall jet was the white noise excitation source for the beam motion. The natural freo\nquency of the beam calculated from equation (8) by using a density of 2. 42x10 kilograms\nper cubic meter and a Young\'s modulus of 1. 6x10 newtons per square meter\nis 52 kilohertz, which is 20 percent higher than the measured value. Changing the\neffective length of the beam by only 0.25 millimeter would account for the difference\nbetween measured and calculated values.\n\nThe high natural frequency makes the drag-force anemometer useful up to approximately 10 kilohertz. The fact that the silicon beam with diffused strain gages is very\nnearly an ideal second-order system suggests that it can be electronically compensated\n(ref. 5) and that the frequency response can be extended to 100 kilohertz or beyond.\n\nZero Drift and Sensitivity Stability\nAs mentioned previously, the beam is inherently temperature compensated because\nthe four strain gages are located close to each other. However, the beam can be subjected to thermal stresses in the region of the strain gages because of the differences\nin thermal expansion among the beam, the metal support, and the epoxy which bonds\nthe beam to the support. For the anemometer described in this report, the silicon\nbeam with an expansion coefficient of 2.5x10 per \xc2\xb0C was bonded to stainless steel\n(expansion coefficient of 18xlO~ /\xc2\xb0C) with an epoxy whose coefficient was about\n90xlO~ per \xc2\xb0C. The normal zero drift and the drift in zero associated with the thermal\nexpansion problem can be minimized by setting the zero on the anemometer before each\nrun and checking it immediately following the run. Preferably, zero settings should be\nmade with the beam at fluid temperature. When the results shown in figure 7 were\ngenerated, in a nearly ambient-temperature air jet, zero drifts were typically less than\n0. 02 millivolt.\nThe drift associated with thermal expansion can probably be reduced by using a\nbeam support material such as Invar, with thermal expansion nearly matching that of\nsilicon. Also, silicon beams are available that are inorganically bonded to a glass\npedestal, which decreases the effect of the epoxy mounting joint because the joint is\nfarther from the strain gages.\nIf only the ac portion of the dynamic velocity head is of interest in a particular\napplication, zero drift is of no concern. However, the stability of the sensitivity is of\nconcern. During testing of the anemometer, the sensitivity remained constant except\nfor the fan jet engine application described in the section APPLICATIONS. During the\nengine run, the silicon beam was exposed to a gas temperature in excess of 150 C,\nwhich was beyond the recommended operating temperature of 120 C. The overtemperature exposure resulted in a permanent decrease in sensitivity of about 30 percent.\n\nAPPLICATIONS\nBecause of the preliminary nature of the work described in this report, only two\napplications have been tested thus far. In the first, the drag-force anemometer was\nused to measure the intensity of turbulence of a room-temperature air jet. The\n8\n\nrelation between anemometer output and turbulence is as follows.\nK the instantaneous velocity Uj^ contains only frequency components small com-,\npared with the natural frequency of the beam, the relation between the output voltage\nand the velocity of a constant-density gas stream is\n.\n(U)\n\ninst\nwhere\n\n(12)\nso that\nV +v = K ( U + u ) \'\n+ 2uU + u,)\n\n(13)\n\nThe mean electrical output V is related to the mean velocity U by\nT2\nv =Kir\n\nso that dropping the u\n\ni\n\n(14)\n\nterm results in\nv = 2uKU\n\n(15)\n\nIf equation (15) is divided by equation (14), the result is\nu _ v\nU 2V\n\n(16)\n\nSquaring equation (16), taking the mean, and then taking the square root give\n\nU\n\n2V\n\n(17)\n\nThe drag-force anemometer was used to measure the turbulence intensity in the\nfree jet described in reference 6. The turbulence intensity was measured at two locations with both the drag-force anemometer and a hot-wire anemometer. The bandwidth\nwas 10 Mlohertz for both measurements. On the jet centerline 0.57 jet diameter downstream from the start of the jet, both the hot-wire and drag-force anemometers measured an intensity of 1.8 percent. At 2.29 diameters downstream from the start of the\njet and 0. 2 diameter from the jet centerline, the hot-wire anemometer measured a\n4.3-percent intensity and the drag-force anemometer measured a 3. 8-percent intensity.\nThese hot-wire measurements are also in agreement with those taken previously\n(ref. 6) to within the accuracy of the hot-wire anemometer.\nIn the second application, a drag-force anemometer was inserted in a turbofan\nengine in the annulus downstream of the first fan rotor. The anemometer was used as\na diagnostic instrument to aid in determining possible changes between flutter and nonflutter flow conditions of the first fan rotor. Typical results are shown in figure 11.\nFigure 11 (a) shows the variation in dynamic flow angle for several blade passages. The\nblade passing frequency is about 5 kilohertz. Figure ll(a) is the profile obtained by\naveraging 64 time traces of the same blade passages. The ordinate in figure ll(b) is\nproportional to the power spectral density of the anemometer output signal. The largest\npeak represents the blade passing frequency. There are frequencies present in figure ll(b) which are not multiples of the engine speed, and these can be correlated to\nflutter frequencies.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nA drag-force anemometer has been developed which is capable of dynamic flow\nmeasurement. The anemometer consists of a silicon beam 2. 5 millimeters long and\n0.25 millimeter thick with an integral diffused strain-gage bridge as the force-measuring\nelement. The following conclusions were drawn from tests of its performance in subsonic flow:\n1. When the anemometer is oriented so that flow is nearly perpendicular to the beam\nsurface, the output of the strain-gage bridge is proportional to the velocity head. Over\nthe range of Mach numbers from 0 to 0.6, the output is linear with velocity head to\nwithin the accuracy of measurement.\n2. The anemometer can be used in both forward and reversed flow.\n3. The anemometer is capable of measuring flow direction when the beam is\noriented so that flow is nearly parallel to the beam surface. However, for nearly parallel flow the output is proportional to both flow angle and velocity head, so that two\nmeasurements are required if the anemometer is used for flow angle determination.\nThe beam is capable of measuring flow angles in excess of \xc2\xb140\xc2\xb0.\n10\n\n4. Under dynamic flow conditions, the anemometer has a frequency response like\nthat of a highly underdamped second-order system with a natural frequency of 41.8 kilohertz and a damping coefficient of 0. 007.\n5. The anemometer can be used to measure turbulence intensity. The intensity,\nfor incompressible flow, in the direction normal to the beam surface is simply the rms\nvalue of the bridge output divided by twice the mean value.\n6. The anemometer performed satisfactorily in two applications. In the first, the\nanemometer was used to measure turbulence intensity in a free jet, and the results\nagreed with those measured with a hot-wire anemometer. In the second, the drag-force\nanemometer was used as a diagnostic instrument during fan flutter tests of a fan jet\nengine. Frequencies were detected in the rotor blade wakes which were not multiples\nof the engine speed as well as frequencies which were multiples of the engine speed.\nLewis Research Center,\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration,\nCleveland, Ohio, March 31, 1977,\n505-04.\n\n11\n\nAPPENDIX A\nSYMBOLS\n\narea of beam, m\n\'\n\nCD\nD\n13\n\nproportionality \xe2\x80\xa2 constant in eq.

This quantity,\nov\nwhich is obtained directly from the spectrum analyzer, is found by differentiating B\nand setting dB/df = 0. Then,\n\ndB\ndf\n\n%\n\nC\nF\n3/2 B\n\nwhich is zero at f2 - f 2 (l - 2\xc2\xa3 2 ), or\nf max\n\n(10)\n\nVl - 2t2\n\nIf only the natural frequency is desired, it is generally safe to just read f\nfrom the spectrum analyzer and use fn =* nicix\nf-^o,,. Even for \xc2\xa3 = 0.1, which is a higher\n16\n\nvalue than is likely to be encountered, equation (10) shows that the error is only about\n1 percent.\nWhen f = f_._,,, is inserted in equation (Cl), the maximum amplitude is\nnidx\nC F\nB\n\nmax\n2?\n\nl-\n\nIf F were known, equation (C2) could be used to find \xc2\xa3, and equation (10) could be\nused to find fn- In general, however, F is not known. Instead, use is made of the\nfact that \xc2\xa3 is related to the width of the peak at f = f max Let f"~ be the frequency below f iJLJcLX - at which the amplitude is B_.0_/V2 and\n0 _ _\nUlcLX\n"\nf T. be the frequency above fHlcLX at which the amplitude is B^.^/4/2. On a spectrum\nmo^\n\xe2\x80\xa2\nilicLX f\nanalyzer with a log scale, these are the frequencies at which the amplitude is down 3 dB\nfrom the maximum value.\nIn order to find f_ and f , it is necessary to solve the equation\n,\n\nn\n\nWith m = f/f n , this equation becomes\n(m2 - I)2 + 4C 2 m 2 = 8^(1 - ?2)\n\n(C3)\n\nEquation (C3) may be rewritten as\n(m2 - I)2 + 4\xc2\xa3 2 (m 2 - 1 + 1) - 8\xc2\xa32(1 - ?2\no\n\nso that with the substitution n = m - 1, equation (C3) becomes\nn2 + 4\xc2\xa3 2 n - 4?2(1 - 2? 2 ) = 0\n\n(C4)\n\nThe roots of equation (C4) are\n\n17\n\nor\n\nTogether with equation (10) they give\n\nIf it assumed that the damping coefficient is very small, the quantity involving \xc2\xa3 in\nequation (C5) may be expanded in a Taylor series about \xc2\xa3 = 0, keeping only the terms\nfirst order in \xc2\xa3. When this is done, the result is\nf\n\n+ * W^1\n\n+\n\nS>\n\nx\n\nSolving for \xc2\xa3 gives\n\nC --\n\n(9)\nmax\n\nEquations (1Q) and (9) give the damping coefficient and natural frequency in terms of\nquantities which can be directly measured on a spectrum analyzer.\n\n18\n\nREFERENCES\n1.
