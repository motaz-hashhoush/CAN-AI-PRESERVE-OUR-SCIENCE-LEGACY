b'[ By Jeffrey Bauer I\nBack in 2000, one of the potential Mars projects\ninvolved delivering and then flying an observation plane\nover the planet. Among the challenges of the project\nwas the small size of the capsule that was going to be\nused in order t o get the plane to Mars. With the\nplanet\xe2\x80\x99s thin atmosphere, a plane would need to have\nlarge wings in order to fly efficiently. How could you\npackage a large-winged plane in a small capsule?\n\nWINGS\nTHATINFLATE WHEN NEEDED SEEMED LIKE AN IDEAL\nsolution to the problem. I knew that people had been\nworking on the concept of inflatablewings for other applications, but the technology was immature and unproven.\nBefore anyone would consider a design incorporating\ninflatable wings, you had to know the concept was sound.\nAnd that\xe2\x80\x99s where prototyping enters this story.\nI got together a small team. We learned that a set of\nsmall-scale inflatable wings had been created for a Navy\nmunitions application through a Small Business\nInnovative Research (SBIR) program. At the conclusion\nof that SBIR, the prototype wings became the property\nof the government, and the Navy program offered to\ntransfer the hardware over to us. With the wings in\nhand, we secured discrerionary funding to test our\ndesign concept.\nIn a sense, this prototype we were going to build\nwas the product. We were just trying to answer some\nfundamental questions before we went out and tried to\nadvocate for significant funding to do anything real. And\ntherein lay the beauty of prototyping: it allows you to try\na lot of things in a short period of time, without having\nto spend a lot of money to try them. There were lots of\ndoubters about whether or not this idea had practical\nmerit, and we didn\xe2\x80\x98t know for sure ourselves whether\nany of our ideas would pan out.\n\nOnce he had our video\nas proof of concept,\nhe successfully sold a\n$50-million program based\non our low-cost [roughly\n\n$100,000)prototype.\n\nWe had our model shop design a small airplane\naround the set of wings. All the testing that had been\ndone under the SBIR had used pre-inflated wings;\nbecause we needed wings that could be inflated in flight,\nwe also needed to design an in-flight inflation system.\nWe came up with a system that used compressed\nnitrogen gas to inflate the wings.\nOur prototype flew with stable enough dynamics\nthat it could be controlled and land successfully. We had\nproven the principle that, yes, you could inflate wings in\nflight that wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t fold back on themselves or fail in\nany other mechanics. We had proven the concept to be\na viable option for vehicles with volume constraints.\nWe shot a video as we ran several drop tests where\nwe inflated the wings in flight under varying conditions,\nand then put together a demo to prove to others that\nthis concept does seem to have some merit.\nAt the time we did this demonstration, the interest\nfor a Mars aircraft program faded, and it wasn\xe2\x80\x98t among the\nmissions selected to fly. To our great satisfaction, however,\nthat wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the final word on our prototype project.\nWe sent the test flight video off to anyone we\nthought might be interested in the concept. One of\nthose people was an associate in the military.At the time,\nhe was trying to sell a program that relied on the use of\ninflatable wings. Whenever he briefed people about the\n\nprogram, they all told him that it was unproven and too\nrisky a concept to consider.\nView graphs and a lot of conjecture don\xe2\x80\x99t inspire\npeople to invest in projects. Proof of concept does. Once\nhe had our video as proof of concept, he successfully\nsold a $50-million program based o n our low-cost\n(roughly $100,000) prototype.\nWhy use a prototype? If you can validate basic\nprinciples early in the life of a project, you mitigate risks\nsubstantially before you embark on a full-scale development effort. We answered a fundamental question before\nwe went out and tried to advocate for significant project\nfunding. Things might not have turned out exactly as we\nhad wished, but another part of the government was able\nto benefit from our work, and we are proud of that.\n\nLESSONS\nPrototyping is one of the most crucial tools for innovation. Ideas can be tested and verified quickly by prototyping, before an extensive commitment of resources.\nOne prototype is worth a thousand words. A good\nprototype has the power to communicate more convincingly than any analysis.\nQUESTION\n\nHow do you develop a knowledge database for protoypes?\nASK 13 FOR PRACTITIONERS BY PRACTITIONERS\n\n27\n\n'
