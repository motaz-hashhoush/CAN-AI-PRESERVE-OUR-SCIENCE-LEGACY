Indicial response functions are used to represent the normal force and moment response of the airfoil. The structural equations of motion of the airfoil with bending and torsional degrees of freedom are coupled to the unsteady air loads and the aeroelastic system so modelled is solved as an eigenvalue problem to determine the stability. The aeroelastic equations are also directly integrated with respect to time and the time-domain results compared with the results from the eigenanalysis. A good agreement is obtained. The derivatives of the flutter speed obtained from the eigenanalysis are calculated with respect to the mass and stiffness parameters by both analytical and finite-difference methods for various transonic Mach numbers. The experience gained from the two degree of freedom model is applied to study the sensitivity of the flutter response of a wing with respect to various shape parameters. The parameters being considered are as follows: (1) aspect ratio; (2) surface area of the wing; (3) taper ratio; and (4) sweep. The wing deflections are represented by Chebyshev polynomials. The compressible aerodynamic state-space model used for the airfoil section is extended to represent the unsteady aerodynamic forces on a generally laminated tapered skewed wing. The aeroelastic equations are solved as an eigenvalue problem to determine the flutter speed of the wing. The derivatives of the flutter speed with respect to the shape parameters are calculated by both analytical and finite difference methods.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19940019579, "id": "5941c78149864e898956e878589d87a0", "publicationDate": "1993-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19940019579.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19940019579/downloads/19940019579.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19940019579/downloads/19940019579.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19940019579/downloads/19940019579.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
