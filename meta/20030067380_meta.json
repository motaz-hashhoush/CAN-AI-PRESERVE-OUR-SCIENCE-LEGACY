Neureguh- 1 binds to two members of the ErbB class I tyrosine kinase receptors, ErbB3 and ErbB4. A number of human cancers overexpress the ErbB receptors, and neuregulin can modulate the growth of certain cancer types. Neuregulin-1 has been shown to promote the migration of invasive gliomas of the central nervous system. Neuregulin has also been implicated in schizophrenia, multiple sclerosis and abortive cardiac abnormalities. The full function of neuregulin-1 is not known. In this study we are inserting a cDNA clone obtained from American Type Culture Collection into E.coli expression vectors to express neuregulin- 1 protein. Metal chelate affinity chromatography is used for recombinant protein purification. Crystallization screening will proceed for X-ray diffraction studies following expression, optimization, and protein purification. In spite of medical and scholarly interest in the neuregulins, there are currently no high-resolution structures available for these proteins. Here we present the first steps toward attaining a high-resolution structure of neuregulin- 1, which will help enable us to better understand its function", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20030067380, "endDate": "2003-07-31T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Crystallographic Association", "location": "United States"}}, "meetingId": "5c1fad6ad7be403ab091d7b00c59bcc2", "id": "4d9542cf3d474062aa2b1a7c4d59c3e6"}], "name": "American Crystallographic Association Conference", "location": "Covington, KY", "id": "5c1fad6ad7be403ab091d7b00c59bcc2", "startDate": "2003-07-26T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20030067380, "id": "45d1f7e3033245eb9fa8436dad67a47e", "publicationDate": "2003-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
