In response to the continued vulnerability of U.S. superalloy producers to disruptions in resource supplies, NASA has undertaken a program to address alternatives to the super-alloys containing significant quantities of the strategic materials such as chromium, cobalt, niobium, and tantalum. The research program called Conservation of Strategic Aerospace Materials (COSAM) focuses on substitution, processing, and alternate materials to achieve its goals. In addition to NASA Lewis Research Center, universities and industry play an important role in the COSAM Program. This paper defines what is meant by strategic materials in the aerospace community, presents a strategic materials index, and reviews the resource supply and availability picture from the U.S. point of view. In addition, research results from the COSAM Program are highlighted and future directions for the use of low strategic material alloys or alternate materials are discussed.", "title": "Resources - Supply and availability", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PROCEEDINGS", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-14T11:06:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19900047097, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Stephens, Joseph R."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Lewis Research Center", "location": "Cleveland, OH, United States"}}, "id": "e7b07d6bca3341fd8a80325158d288f1"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Proceedings", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-18T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19900047097, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19900047097, "id": "3cc0455fd893428bb1e61d711074baa3", "publicationDate": "1989-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
