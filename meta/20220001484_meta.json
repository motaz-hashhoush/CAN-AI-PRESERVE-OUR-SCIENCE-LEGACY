In this paper, we report our ongoing effort to integrate these two presently distinct areas into a single framework. To this end, we propose the two-player partially observable stochastic game formalism to capture both high-level autonomous mission planning under uncertainty and adversarial decision making subject to imperfect information. We show that synthesizing sub-optimal strategies for such games is possible under finite-memory assumptions for both the autonomous decision maker and the cyber-adversary. We then describe an experimental testbed to evaluate the efficacy of the proposed framework.", "title": "Partially Observable Games for Secure Autonomy", "stiType": "PREPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20220001484, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Ames, Aaron D."}}, "id": "16ee54b127294b3db78065f84be18486"}, {"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20220001484, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Tan, Kymie"}}, "id": "dc6c3c90d67640368c8ea78dcfc638a8"}, {"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20220001484, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Ingham, Michel D."}}, "id": "db1a34e5608a4f598c8f2ca55fbad9a3"}, {"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20220001484, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Ahmadi, Mohamadreza"}}, "id": "b7ac9ea6530140eaa5cc7aceeecc1a87"}, {"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20220001484, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Viswanathan, Arun A"}}, "id": "e0182666f9974bb080a0ed7d883ab123"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Preprint (Draft being sent to journal)", "technicalReviewType": "NOT_SET", "modified": "2022-09-30T05:50:34.0678210+00:00", "id": 20220001484, "sourceIdentifiers": [{"number": "2014/53088", "type": "HANDLE"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20220001484, "publisher": "Pasadena, CA: Jet Propulsion Laboratory, National Aeronautics and Space Administration, 2020", "id": "4af2cecee2654d289e255b87fb0475c5", "publicationDate": "2020-05-21T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
