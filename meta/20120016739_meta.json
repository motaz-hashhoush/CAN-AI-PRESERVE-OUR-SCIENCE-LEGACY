Even though transient noise is considered a common occurrence in networks, a survey of the literature reveals an emphasis on permanent faults. Transient faults introduce a time element into the analysis of network reliability. With permanent faults it is sufficient to consider the faults that have accumulated by the end of the operating period. With transient faults the arrival and recovery time must be included. The number and location of faults in the system is a dynamic variable. Transient faults also introduce system recovery into the analysis. The goal is the quantitative assessment of network connectivity in the presence of both permanent and transient faults. The approach is to construct a global model that includes all classes of faults: permanent, transient, independent, and correlated. A theorem is derived about this model that give distributions for (1) the number of fault occurrences, (2) the type of fault occurrence, (3) the time of the fault occurrences, and (4) the location of the fault occurrence. These results are applied to compare and contrast the connectivity of different network architectures in the presence of permanent, transient, independent, and correlated faults. The examples below use a Monte Carlo simulation, but the theorem mentioned above could be used to guide fault-injections in a laboratory.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20120016739, "endDate": "2012-10-18T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "31st Digital Avionics Systems Conference", "location": "Williamsburg, VA", "id": "87af3fe580d34706a662e56d898edd31", "startDate": "2012-10-14T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20120016739, "id": "f98e83989d2147cea4edc00535f767cf", "publicationDate": "2012-10-14T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20120016739.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20120016739/downloads/20120016739.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20120016739/downloads/20120016739.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20120016739/downloads/20120016739.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
