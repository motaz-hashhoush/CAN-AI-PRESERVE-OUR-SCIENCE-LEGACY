Some graben are small isolated features whereas others are complex overlapping features in which individual fault pairs are impossible to separate. This pattern indicates an east-west extensional stress regime, consistent with stress models for Tharsis. To estimate the regional east-west extension and strain, graben along a profile at 35 N latitude, between longitudes 135 and 93 degs were studied. This profile was chosen because the graben have a northerly trend, the structures are relatively simple, the profile is anchored to ancient Noachian age crust, and high resolution images are available. The western end of the profile begins at Acheron Fossae and ends in the east at the southwestern part of Tempe Fossae. Plains units cut by the graben include Hesperian and Amazonian age members of the Alba Patera and Ceraunius Fossae Formations.", "title": "Extension and strain in Northern Tharsis", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T16:48:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19920001539, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Plescia, J.
