Developed under a Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) contract, the Phase Doppler Particles Analyzer is a non-disruptive, highly accurate laser-based method of determining particle size, number density, trajectory, turbulence and other information about particles passing through a measurement probe volume. The system consists of an optical transmitter and receiver, signal processor and computer with data acquisition and analysis software. A variety of systems are offered for applications including spray characterization for paint, and agricultural and other sprays. The Microsizer, a related product, is used in medical equipment manufacturing and analysis of contained flows. High frequency components and subsystems produced by Millitech Corporation are marketed for both research and commercial use. These systems, which operate in the upper portion of the millimeter wave, resulted from a number of Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) projects. By developing very high performance mixers and multipliers, the company has advanced the state of the art in sensitive receiver technology. Components are used in receivers and transceivers for monitoring chlorine monoxides, ozone, in plasma characterization and in material properties characterization.", "title": "Small Business Innovations", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-07T12:53:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-27T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20020080261, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20020080261, "isbn": "0-16-045368-2", "id": "9f6d69dde60545c5814027060186f5ee", "publicationName": "Spinoff 1994", "publicationDate": "1994-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20020080261.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20020080261/downloads/20020080261.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20020080261/downloads/20020080261.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20020080261/downloads/20020080261.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
