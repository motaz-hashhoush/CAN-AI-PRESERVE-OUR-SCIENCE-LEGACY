The first stage is\nfollowed by the variable attenuator which is a photocell in an L network consisting basically of Cl, Ri,\nand B.2.\nThe second stage (Q2, Q3) is a simple amplifier\n(continued overleaf)\n\nThis document was prepared under the sponsorship of the National\t\nAeronautics and Space Administration. Neither the United States\t\nGovernment nor any person acting on behalf of the United States\t\n\nGovernment assumes any liability resulting from the use of the\ninformation contained in this document, or warrants that such use\nwill be free from privately owned rights.\n\nthat provides isolation between the attenuator Ri\nand the output stage Q4; this stage reduces the reactance at the output of the attenuator Ri and helps\nreduce phase shift as it is varied by the AGC power\ndissipated in the lamp.\nThe output stage Q4 is a power amplifier which\nsupplies 180 milliwatts. Two types of feedback are\nprovided by the transformer configuration at the output of Q4. The feedback from the collector of Q4 to\nits base, through R3 and C2, lowers the output impedance of Q4 while the feedback from the transformer T2 developed across R4 and coupled to the\nbase raises the output impedance. The potentiometer\n(113) between these two points can be used to provide\na variety of adjustments between the two kinds of\nfeedback. The output impedance can be varied from\nabout 10 ohms to about 100 ohms, thus making it possible for the novel distribution amplifier to accommodate a wide range of loading. In the present application, the adjustment is made for 50\xc2\xb12 ohms. The\ncapacitor C5 is in a lead network which cancels the\nreactive component on the output of the amplifier.\nThe RF output level also passes through CS into\na detector (115, R6, C4, and Dl) which generates a\nDC voltage proportional to the RF level. The DC\nvoltage is compared to an adjustable reference voltage (D2; 117) and the difference is then amplified and\n\nB72-10245\t\n\nphased properly to drive the lamp. The intensity of\nlight falling on the photocell attenuator (Ri) controls\nthe input of the RF output; the desired output level\nis set by R7.\nThe amplifier was used to drive a passive hybrid\npower divider which split the power eight ways and\nprovided eight outputs at 20 milliwatts (1 volt rms)\neach. Phase noise is so small that it cannot be measured accurately with instrumentation ordinarily available in development laboratories.\n\nNote:\nRequests for further information may be directed\nto:\nTechnology Utilization Officer\nNASA Pasadena Office\n4800 Oak Grove Drive\nPasadena, California 91103\nReference: TSP 72-10245\n\nPatent status:\nNo patent action is contemplated by NASA.\nSource: George F.
