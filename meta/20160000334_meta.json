As part of the effort to determine that focus, a survey was conducted in May of 2014 to solicit opinions of members of the aerospace industry as to what they considered the most important and beneficial cryogenic technologies to be developed in the near term. The project was also directed to consider the SLS exploration upper stage (EUS) as a potential infusion target, and to focus on technology that would provide the most immediate benefit to a cryogenic system of that type.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20160000334, "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "NASA Glenn Research Center", "location": "Cleveland, OH United States"}}, "meetingId": "3437c5e674ac4e958577ba12156665f7", "id": "24ce3a2d39854a06909a10374ab265db"}], "name": "Internal briefing", "location": "Cleveland, OH", "id": "3437c5e674ac4e958577ba12156665f7", "startDate": "2015-06-30T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20160000334, "id": "d3aafb6b1f414b6ca289e9cbd5c72c9b", "publicationDate": "2015-06-30T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20160000334.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20160000334/downloads/20160000334.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20160000334/downloads/20160000334.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20160000334/downloads/20160000334.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
