b'Mechanics\nAdvanced Infant Car Seat Would Increase Highway Safety\nThis system would keep a baby safe, comfortable, and entertained, thereby reducing\ndistractions for an adult driver.\nMarshall Space Flight Center, Alabama\nAn advanced infant car seat has\nbeen proposed to increase highway\nsafety by reducing the incidence of crying, fussy behavior, and other child-related distractions that divert an adult\ndriver\xe2\x80\x99s attention from driving. In addition to a conventional infant car seat\n\nwith safety restraints, the proposed advanced infant car seat would include a\nnumber of components and subsystems that would function together as a\ncomprehensive infant-care system that\nwould keep its occupant safe, comfortable, and entertained, and would en-\n\nVideo\nCamera\n\nVideo\nCamera\n\nPull-Down\nHandle\n\nVideo\nMonitor\n\nMiniature Video Cameras in the sides of the advanced infant car seat would transmit images to a\nvideo monitor on the dashboard, enabling the driver to monitor the infant visually while facing the\nroad ahead.\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, November 2004\n\nable the driver to monitor the baby\nwithout having to either stop the car or\nturn around to face the infant during\ndriving.\nThe system would include a vibrator\nwith bulb switch to operate; the switch\nwould double as a squeeze toy that\nwould make its own specific sound. A\nmusic subsystem would include loudspeakers built into the seat plus digital\nand analog circuitry that would utilize\nplug-in memory modules to synthesize\nmusic or a variety of other sounds. The\nmusic subsystem would include a built-in\nsound generator that could synthesize\nwhite noise or a human heartbeat to\ncalm the baby to sleep. A second bulb\nswitch could be used to control the\nmusic subsystem and would double as a\nsqueeze toy that would make a distinct\nsound.\nAn antinoise sound-suppression system would isolate the baby from potentially disturbing ambient external noises.\nThis subsystem would include small microphones, placed near the baby\xe2\x80\x99s ears,\nto detect ambient noise. The outputs of\nthe microphone would be amplified and\nfed to the loudspeakers at appropriate\namplitude and in a phase opposite that\nof the detected ambient noise, such that\nthe net ambient sound arriving at the\nbaby\xe2\x80\x99s ears would be almost completely\ncancelled.\nA video-camera subsystem would enable the driver to monitor the baby visually while continuing to face forward.\nOne or more portable miniature video\ncameras could be embedded in the side\nof the infant car seat (see figure) or in a\nflip-down handle. The outputs of the\nvideo cameras would be transmitted by\nradio or infrared to a portable, miniature receiver/video monitor unit that\nwould be attached to the dashboard of\nthe car. The video-camera subsystem can\nalso be used within transmission/reception range when the seat was removed\nfrom the car.\nThe system would include a biotelemetric and tracking subsystem, which\nwould include a Global Positioning System receiver for measuring its location.\n\n19\n\nThis subsystem would transmit the location of the infant car seat (even if the\nseat were not in a car) along with such\nbiometric data as the baby\xe2\x80\x99s heart rate,\nperspiration rate, urinary status, temperature, and rate of breathing. Upon detecting any anomalies in the biometric\ndata, this subsystem would send a warning to a paging device installed in the\ncar or carried by the driver, so that the\ndriver could pull the car off the road to\nattend to the baby. A motion detector in\n\n20\n\nthis subsystem would send a warning if\nthe infant car seat were to be moved or\notherwise disturbed unexpectedly while\nthe infant was seated in it: this warning\nfunction, in combination with the position-tracking function, could help in\nfinding a baby who had been kidnapped\nwith the seat.\nRemovable rechargeable batteries\nwould enable uninterrupted functioning of all parts of the system while transporting the baby to and from the car.\n\nThe batteries could be recharged via the\ncigarette-lighter outlet in the car or by\nuse of an external AC-powered charger.\nThis work was done by Richard Dabney\nand Susan Elrod of Marshall Space Flight\nCenter.\nThis invention is owned by NASA, and a\npatent application has been filed.
