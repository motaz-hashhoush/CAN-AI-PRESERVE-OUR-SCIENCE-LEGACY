General Block Diagram of Real-Time Statistical Time-Series Analysis\n\nA relatively inexpensive device operating on the\nelectrical time representation of an input signal has been\nconceived. This device will extract the average frequency\nof human speech and produce the second, third and\nfourth moments of instantaneous frequency about this\naverage. Because it can be used by personnel who have\nnot had specialized training it has significant advantages\nwhich will appeal to government agencies and industries\nconcerned with communications.\nAttempts have been made to simulate the process\n\nof a real-time statistical analysis of the time intervals between zero axis crossings of a given input signal in the\npast. But these have been confined to the laboratory\nand no self-contained system has been built specifically\nfor this purpose. Because the laboratory test sets have\nbeen limited to a specialized purpose they have had no\ngeneral application.\nThis innovation comprises four major components: a zero-crossing detector, a frequency-to-amplitude\nconverter, an integrator, and a moment generating net(continued overleaf)\n\nThis document was prepared under the sponsorship of the National\t\nAeronautics and Space Administration. Neither the United States\t\nGovernment nor any person acting on behalf of the United States \t\n\nGovernment assumes any liability resulting from the use of the\ninformation contained in this document, or warrants that such use\nwill be free from privately owned-rights.\n\nwork. Figure 1 illustrates the function of the analysis\noperation. The input signal is first passed through the\nzero-crossing detector and the signal zero-crossing signal\nis then converted by the frequency-to-amplitude converter. From here the converted signal frequencies are\npassed through a network to allow the integrator to\nmeasure the average frequency. This is then subtracted\nfrom the instantaneous frequency and appropriately\nmultiplied to produce the second, third and fourth\nstatistical moments of the input signal zero-crossings in\nreal-time.\nIn general the Analyzer can be used to perform\nstatistical analysis on the zero-crossing of almost any signal. But its main purpose is to analyze human speech.\nThe device does this by defining and displaying the first\nfourth central statistical moments of the reciprocal time\ndistance between successive zero-crossings. The analysis\nbegins by converting the input speech signal to a square\nwave showing variations only in the signal zero-crossing\npoints. Then, the time intervals between the varying\nzero-crossing joints are measured, inverted, and converted with relative amplitudes. These amplitudes are\naveraged, and then used to calculate the second, third\nand fourth central statistical moments. When displayed\non an oscilloscope these moments illustrate the emphasis\nof the transition between phonetic sounds in given\nspeech samples.\n\nBrief 71-10276\n\nThe advantages of this innovation are that it can\nbe operated by non-specialized personnel to provide\nspeech analysis without the use of complex ancillary\nequipment such as computers. Moreover, the Statistical\nTime-Series Analyzer has a selectable bandwidth. As\nsuch it will be of interest to the communications industry where complex waveforms need to be analyzed.\n\nNote:\nRequests for further information may be directed\nto:\nTechnology Utilization Officer\nManned Spacecraft Center, Code JM7\nHouston, Texas 77058\nReference: TSP71- 10276\n\nPatent status:\nInquiries about obtaining rights for the commercial use of this invention may be made to:\nPatent Counsel\nMail Code AM\nNASA Manned Spacecraft Center\nHouston, Texas 77058\nSource: Carrington H.
