However, the impact of stratospheric intrusions in the remaining seasons and over the rest of the USA is less clear. A new approach to the study of stratospheric intrusions uses NASA's Goddard Earth Observing System Model (GEOS) model and assimilation products with an objective feature tracking algorithm to investigate the atmospheric dynamics that generate stratospheric intrusions and the different mechanisms through which stratospheric intrusions may influence tropospheric chemistry and surface air quality seasonally over both the western and the eastern USA. A catalog of stratospheric intrusions identified in the MERRA-2 reanalysis was produced for the period 2004-2015 and validated against surface ozone observations (focusing on those which exceed the national air quality standard) and a recent data set of stratospheric intrusion-influenced air quality exceedance flags from the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Considering not all ozone exceedances have been flagged by the EPA, a collection of stratospheric intrusions can support air quality agencies for more rapid identification of the impact of stratospheric air on surface ozone and demonstrates that future operational analyses may aid in forecasting such events. An analysis of the spatiotemporal variability of stratospheric intrusions over the continental US was performed, and while the spring over the western USA does exhibit the largest number of stratospheric intrusions affecting the lower troposphere, the number of intrusions in the remaining seasons and over the eastern USA is sizable. By focusing on the major modes of variability that influence weather in the USA, such as the Pacific North American (PNA) teleconnection index, predicative meteorological patterns associated with stratospheric intrusions and their regional effects on tropospheric ozone were identified. Improved understanding of the connections between large-scale climate variability and local-scale dynamically-driven air quality events may support improved seasonal prediction of such events.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20180000572, "endDate": "2017-12-15T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Geophysical Union", "location": "Washington, DC, United States"}}, "meetingId": "06600a5b9634411eb100ade9f90dd40b", "id": "825bbe723f2e490b8d1315a20640f13b"}], "name": "American Geophysical Union (AGU) 2017 Fall Meeting", "location": "New Orleans, LA", "id": "06600a5b9634411eb100ade9f90dd40b", "startDate": "2017-12-11T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20180000572, "id": "c57e3e7a651a481ab6bf6fb41235952a", "publicationDate": "2017-12-11T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20180000572.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20180000572/downloads/20180000572.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20180000572/downloads/20180000572.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20180000572/downloads/20180000572.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
