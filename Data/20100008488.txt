Ranging from the early astronomical\nmeasurements to analyses of samples from the\nMartian surface in the form of Martian meteorites.\nThe first direct attempt to analyze the carbon species on the surface was in 1976 with the Viking\nGC-MS in-situ experiment which gave inconclusive results at two sites on Mars [1]. With the\nrecognition in 1983 that samples of the Martian\nsurface were already present on Earth in the form\nof Martian meteorites by Bogard and Johnson [2]\nnew opportunities became available for direct\nstudy of Mars\xe2\x80\x99s samples in terrestrial\nlaboratories.\nCarbon isotopic compositional information suggested a reduced carbon component was present\nin the Martian meteorites [3-5]. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons associated with carbonate\nglobules in ALH84001 were later identified [6,7].\nJull et al [8] noted that an insoluble component\nwas present within Nakhla and more than 75% of\nits C lacked any 14C, which is modern-day carbon\ncontaminant. This carbon fraction was believed\nto be either indigenous (i..e. Martian) or ancient\nmeteoritic carbon phase. Within the fractures of\nNakhla and ALH84001, Fisk et al [9,10] identified reduced carbon-enriched areas. Gibson et al.\n[11] using a combination of NanoSIMS, Focused\nElectron microscopy, Laser Raman Spectorscopy\nand Stepped-Combustion Static Mass Spectrometry analyses the presence of possible indigenous\nreduced carbon comp onents within the 1.3 Ga old\nNakhla.\nNanoSIMS analysis of Nakhla\xe2\x80\x99s interior\nsamples [1 1 ] showed the presence of an optically\ndark dendritic material fracture-filling reduce carbon phase which showed a direct correlation between C- and CN- abundances. In addition, Laser\nRaman Spectrometry identified an apparent complex mixture of carbonaceous compounds associated with the Nakhla dendritic material and the\niddingsite produced by the alteration of primary\nsilicates within the meteorite.\n\nStepped combustion static mass spectrometry analysis of the iddingsite phases\n-rich\ncontaining the dark dendritic materials was able\nto distinguish different C- and N-bearing components present within Nakhla. Three distinct carbon components were identified in Nakhla. A\nlow-temperature C component released below\n300 o C was predominantly terrestrial contamination with a carbon isotopic composition of -22 to 24%o. A reduced C-bearing component with isotopic composition of ~-16 to -20%o was measured\nin the 400 to 550 o C intervals. Possible presence\nof a pre-terrestrial secondary carbonate with a\ncarbon isotopic composition of >+5%o was released at T >550 o C. The isotopic composition of\nthe reduced C-component was identical to values\nof -18 to -20%o reported earlier by Jull et al. [8]\nand Stepton [12]. Gibson et al. [11]\xe2\x80\x99s analyses\nwere the first isotopic measurements of directly\nimaged high molecular weight carbonaceous\ncomponents in Nakhla.\nPrevious measurements\nwere from bulk Nahkla samples with no direct\nobservation of the C-bearing phases. The nitrogen isotopic composition of the reduced Ccomponent was ~+5%o. It is clear that the organic phases are a ssociated with the iddingsiterich alteration regions of Nakhla. The fluids associated with the iddingsite production seen\nwithin Nakhla and other SNC samples along with\nthe carbonate globules within ALH84001 were\ncarriers of the reduced carbon hydrocarbon components. The recent study by Thomas-Keprta et\nal. [13] clearly showed that a unique population\nof magnetites, with a possible biogenic signatures,\nwere formed from aqueous fluids in which possible reduced carbon-bearing components were present.\nFrom the evidence contained within\nALH84001\xe2\x80\x99s carbonate globules formed at 3.9 Ga\n(in the first 600,000 million years of Martian history) it is suggestive that abundant water reservoirs and movement of aqueous fluids within the\nplanet\xe2\x80\x99s crust was occurring. These aqueous fluids were also the carriers of the unique magnetites\ntrapped within the carbonates observed n\n\nEarly Mars: A warm wet niche for Life. Gibson et al.\n\nALH84001 [13]. In addition, the association of\nthe PAH\xe2\x80\x99s enrichment in the magnetite-bearing\ncarbonate globules of ALH84001, strongly suggests reduced carbon being present in the martian\naqueous reservoirs at 3.9 Ga. The estimated ages\nof the alteration produces (i.e. iddingsite) within\nthe 1.3 Ga Nakhla are around 600,000 million\nyears ago [14]. The presence of the reduced dark\ndendritic materials in the iddingsite-rich fractures\nof Nakhla are suggestive of introduction of carbon components in the \xe2\x80\x9crecent past\xe2\x80\x9d Mars.\non\nWith the evidence of reduced-carbon phases present in the fluid reservoirs on Mars 3.9 Ga years\nago and at 600,000 million years ago as observed\nin Nakhla, the possibility of reduced carbon components present within the current near-surface\nfluid reservoirs on Mars must not be ruled out. It\nmay be possible that the recent fluid discharges\nobserved within the solar heated walls of craters\nand within channel walls may be carrying reduced\norganic components. However, with the UV irradiation experienced by the surface of Mars, the\nresident time for these reduced carbon phases\nmay be limited. Should the deposits bearing the\ncarbon-rich fluids b ecome buried, the probability\nof survival for the organic components greatly\nincrease.\nSuitable sites for reduced-carbon rich\ncomponents are present on Mars. The recently\nidentified \xe2\x80\x9cmud volcanoes\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9csprings\xe2\x80\x9d locations on Mars as identified by Oehler and Allen\n[15] are candidate sites. We must use the right\ntools to positively identify the signatures of life.\nUntil the proper suite of analytical instruments are\non the Martian surface or a well-characterized\nsample is returned from Mars, the Martian meteorites are our only hope for unraveling the nature\nof the reduced carbon components present on\nMars and the signatures of life on Mars.\nReferences:\n\n[1] Biemann K. et al., (1977) J.G.R. 82, 46414658.
