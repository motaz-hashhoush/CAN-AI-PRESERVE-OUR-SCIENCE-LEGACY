A key component of Terabeam's Fiberless Network is Large Aperture Holographic Optic technology, developed by Ralcon Development Lab, of Paradise, Utah. Ralcon developed the Holographic Optical Element (HOE) technology with assistance from a NASA Goddard Space Flight Center Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) contract. Terabeam further developed the HOE technology and incorporated it into its Fiberless Optical Network-sending an immeasurable amount of information soaring overhead. Terabeam developed its Fiberless Optical Network using a proprietary HOE to transmit data. The unit is mounted near an office window and has the ability to beam safe, low-power, invisible data through the air at gigabits-per-second speeds to anywhere in the service area. Gigabits-per-second speeds are thousands of times faster than the speeds of current broadband transmissions. This allows businesses to connect to local-area networks (LANs) as well as WANs, in a quick and affordable manner.", "title": "Business is Beaming", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-07T12:47:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-27T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20020062180, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20020062180, "id": "04ae785628904df6b1922a8fa3e15590", "publicationName": "Spinoff 2001: Special Millennium Feature", "publicationDate": "2001-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20020062180.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20020062180/downloads/20020062180.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20020062180/downloads/20020062180.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20020062180/downloads/20020062180.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
