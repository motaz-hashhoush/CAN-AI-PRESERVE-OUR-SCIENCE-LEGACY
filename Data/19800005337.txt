Johnson Space Center,\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration.\nThis publication, then, is an accumulation of\ninformation extracted from the various areas of\ncapability in the Earth Observations Division.\nEach described capal)ili.ty has been written,\nreviewed, or edited by personnel in the respective area of capability. The document was\ncompiled and prepared by Lockheed Electronics\nCompany, Inc., Systems and Services Division,\nHouston, Texas.\nIt is recognized that a single point of contact\nis required for additional information on the\ncapabilities described in this document. The\nData Research and Control Facility has been\nselected as the appropriate point of contact\nfor this information. Additional information\non any of the documents listed in the bibliography section for each area of capability may\nbe obtained from R. D. Bratton, Systems and\nFacilities Branch, NASA/SF6, Lyndon B. Johnson\nSpace Center, Houston, Texas 77058.\nBecause of the dynamic nature of data reduction\nand analysis capabilities in the Earth resources\ntechnology, this document has been formatted\nto facilitate the addition of chances or new\nmaterial and the removal of obsolete material\nas chan g es in the capabilities occur. It will\nbe updated in the future as required.\nc\nD: flay, Chief\nF\ni\nsystems and Facilities Branch\nEarth Obsurvations Division\n\ni\'.:.ECEDING PAGE BLANK NOT FILMf

In addition, at the user\'s option, histograms and spectral plots may be computed for each\nfield and/or subclass.\nThe CLASSIFY processor classifies the MSS image\ndata based on statistics computed from the\ntraining fields. It accepts the Universal- or\nLA WS-III-formatted MSS data tape, traininq\nstatistics from the STAT processor, a Btransformation matrix, and field definition card\nimages. Given the statistics for each subclass\nof interest, CLA?:\'IFY assigns each data point\nwithin the spe::ified field to a subclass, using\n\nSTAT\n\nCLASSIFY\n\n-.i\xc2\xb1.h,-\xe2\x80\xa2r *Jle stnn ,irl y d m-cl.iss maximum likelihood\n2_g\n\n4HANAL PAGE fs\nDOOR QUALM\n\nt\n\nclassification or the sum-of-nor a l-densities\nrule. In support of Procedure 1, CLASSIFY obtains\nrabalass a priori values and assigns category\nnames using subclass population and class name\ndata from the input statistics file. It prints\nline printer map of the classification data,\nwith each classified point represented by a\nsymbol, and outputs the results to -the classification map tape file for use in the DISPLAY\nprocessor.\n\nDISPLAY\n\nThe DISPLAY processor accepts the classification\nmap tape file output by the CLASSIFY processor\nor the dot data file output by the DOTDATA processor, performs various functions in the classification process, and displays the results. The\nresults generated on the line printer include a\nclassification summary and a map of each classified fields an intensive test site (ITS)\nsu=mary reports classification performance\nsummaries for ground-truth areas within the\nclassified image; or, if in the dot processing\nmode, cot data classification performance summaries. optionally, it generates a tape of the\nclassified image for display on the Passive\nMicrowave Imaging System/Data Analysis Station\n(PMIS/DAS) .\n\nISOCLS-\t\n\nThe Iterative Self-Organizing Clustering System\n(ISOCLS) processor clusters data by determining\nthe nearest cluster center to a pixel and assigning the pixel to that cluster. After an assignment is completed, new cluster centers are\ndetermined and the process is repeated. A class\nconsisting of one or more fields is input from\nthe MSS image data tape. The number of classes\nthat may be clustered is limited to 75 (if the\nstatistics file from the STAT processor is used)\nor to 60 [if feature selection (SELECT) or\nCLASSIFY processor output is used]. If in the\nProcedure 1 mode, ISOCLS requires a statistics\nfile, initial cluster centers on card images,\nand starting dots as output by the DOTDATA\nprocessor. ISOCLS outputs a statistics file,\na printout of cluster results, and (optionally)\na cluster map tape for displaying results on\nthe Bendix 100 Interactive Drafting System (IDS)\nor on the PMIS/DAS.\n\n2-10\n\n3\t\n\nU":\n\nW461 d\n\nThe TESTSP processor is an iterative self-^\nt organising clustering system which clusters pixel\nvalues and stores then on disk in packed form\nOas pixel value per byte) rather than in floating point form (one pixel value per four bytes).\n+I\n\n%a DOTDATA processor was developed to facilitate\nLACIE Procedure 1, in which pixels or dots are\nlabeled instead of training fields (the analyst-\n\naids procedure) . DOTDATA creates a data file of,\nlabeled dots on tape. This file is an interface-1\nto the ISOCLS, automatic cluster labeling (LABEL),\nand DISPLAY processors for clustering, cluster\nlabeling, and displaying results, respectively.\nThe SELECT processor accepts a statistics file\nfrom either the STAT or ISOCLS processor,\nmeasures the relative importance of the individual channels (features), and outputs the set of\nchannels which provides the best discrimination\nbetween subclasses. The user chooses either the\nweighted average interclass or transformed divergence or the weighted average Bhattacharyya distance to measure the separability of subclasses.\nThe Exhaustive Search, Without Replacement, or\nDavidon-Pletcher-Powell procedure is used to\nselect the best set of channels. SELECT also\noutputs the B-transformation matrix for later\ninput to the CLASSIFY, data transformation\n( DATA -TR), scatter plot ( SCTRPL), SELECT, and/or\nstatistics transformation ( TRSTAT) processor.\nThe DATA - TR processor transforms images from the\n\'\nMSS image data tape by performin g a linear transformation on user-defined fields. one of three\nmethods is used to effect the transformation:\nthe histogram or the statistical method, in which\nda ta are rescaled, or a method utilizing userinput scaling parameters. The transformed or\nrescaled data are output on tape in Universal or\nLARSYS II format, along with a line printer plot\nof the histogram ( if applicable).\nThe TRSTAT processor uses the data produced from\nthe STAT and/or ISOCLS processor to transform\nthe means find covariances of the clusters.

User\noptions determine which of the three merge capabilities (channel, spatial, or line) will be\nutilised.\n\nGTDDM\n\nThe ground-truth dot dump (GTDDM) processor uses\nthe converted ground-truth tape from the groundtruth tale conversion (GTTCN) processor to label\nthe 209 grid points or dots in the field. A\ndot card file in the LACIE format is made for\neach ground-truth image file. Inputs to the program via card image are a crop-code-to-category\ntransformation data set and a card image specifying type 1 or 2 dots and label type.\n\nGTTCN\t\n\nThe GTTCN processor converts input ground-truth\nUniversal-formatted image tapes containing 392\nsamples and 351 lines to Universal-formatted\nLACIE image size containing 196 samples and\n117 lines.\n\nUTILITIES\t\n\nForty-nine utility subprograms support the various EOD- LARSYS processors.

It is designed to process data from various imaging sensors and allows the analyst to\ninterpret data as processing takes place. The\nsystem can be easily modified to support various\ntypes of sensor data.\n\n(\t\n\nGENERAL\n\nThe LACIE System evolved from the EPIPS, which\nwas developed and placed in operation at JSC in\n1974, with a set of remote terminals connected\nto the IBM 360/75 computer in the Real-Time\nComputer Complex (RTCC), JSC Building 30. Its\npurpose was to allow user-machine interactive\nprocessing of remotely sensed data by means of\narea mensuration, image handling, batch production, classification from multi-image disk\nstorage, and classification character mapping\nfor printer output. Its capabilities were\nenhanced to include cursor and image positioning\nand a wide variety of statistical computations\nto achieve pattern recognition, clustering, signature extension, remote field definition, and\nimage registration.\nThe ERIPS emerged as a comprehensive facility for\nprocessing multispectral remoto sensor data. Its\nwidespread use in the EOD fostered the addition\nof a set of terminals in the Data Techniques\nLaboratory (DTL) in late 1974. From 1974 through\n1977, the ERIPS capabilities were enhanced to\naccommodate the LACIE; and the system came to\nbe used exclusively for LACIE processing. These\nevents brought about a change from ERIPS to the\npresent system nomenclature.\n\nt\t\n\ne\t\n\nThe LACIE System is capable of processing remotely\nsensed data from various imaging sensors, including the Landsat 16-channel MSS and return beam\nvidicon (RBV), the Multispectral Camera System\n(MCS) 24-channel scanner, the Earth Resources\nExperiment Package (EREP) 13-channel scanner,\nand the Michigan 12-channel scanner.

Since its original delivery,\nscat of the programs have been modified, and\nadditional processing systems and special. programs have been added, resulting in an extensive\nelaboration of the General Electric version. A\nmultiuser environment has been implemented by its\ninterface with th ,3 Programmed Data Processor,\nModel 11/45 (PDP 11/45), and the Resource Sharing\nExecutive, Model 11D (RSX-11D). Additional disk\nstorage has increased program capacity.\n\nGENERAL\n\nThe Image 100 is a highly interactive system\nwhich, through man-machine communication, enables\nthe analyst to make many decisions while processing digital imagery data.\nV : Image 100 accepts multichannel imagery on\nnine-track digital tape in the Landsat MSS bulk\nor Universal or LARSYS format. The system was\ndesigned primarily for four-channel imagery with\nthe fifth channel reserved for theme storage.\nTherefore, when more than four-channel data are\nprocessed, only four channels at a time will\nnormally be loaded into the refresh memory. In\naddition to the nine-:rack tape capability, the\nsystem is equipped with an input scanner unit\nfor digitizing and displaying data on the CRT\nscreen. The scanner accepts photographic prints\nor transparencies in color or black and white\nand has three filters for color digitizing. The\ndigitized data are loaded into the refresh\nmemory and therefore may be analyzed as if\nloaded from tape.\nThe basic Image 100 possesses the following\nspecial capabilities:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Interactive training mode enabling the user\nto interact with data on a real-time basis.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Signature analysis for any number of thematic\nclasses; as many as nine themes may be displayed simultaneously.\n4-1\n\n10\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Display of processed results (themes) to\neamnced form an colas\' CRT WLthin semads.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Uscr*iration technique Mrich is easily\nmodifiaMe by tlfe user to eliminate.\n\nmisclassifications.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 integral, high-speed, special-purpose,\nparall\xe2\x80\xa21 processing circuitry.\t\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Simmitaneous four-channel (or five with preprocessing) parallelepiped or histogrammed \t\nsignature analysis.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Multiple user-selectable preprocessing modes\nused an each pixel in the image= i.e.t\n\xe2\x80\x94 Normalization\n\xe2\x80\x94 Ratioing techniques (two)\n\xe2\x80\x94 General-purpose transformation\n\xe2\x80\x94 Shading correction\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Bulk processing mode allowing rapid classification of total flight-line or Landsat image\nfrom magnetic tape (requires addition of\nsoftware).\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Split-screen format permitting display of\npreprocessing, training, and classification\nresults over large noncontiguous geographical\nareas while maintaining large-scale resolution.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Multiple input modes:\n\xe2\x80\x94 Color and color-infrared photographs\n(\t\n\n\xe2\x80\x94 Multiband black-and-white photographs\n\xe2\x80\x94 Digital tapes\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Wide variety of outputs:\n\xe2\x80\x94 Color CRT display\n\xe2\x80\x94 Graphics display terminal for exhibiting\nalphanumeric text, graphics, and clusters\n\xe2\x80\x94 Line printer output for producing hardcopy\ndigital maps, contour plots, graphics, and\ndata tabulations\n\xe2\x80\x94 Digital theme tapers\n\na-a\n\n.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\t\nTr\n\n-_\'\t\n\nThe items of equipment which support the multi-\n\n_-\t\n\nuser environment of the Image 100 allow an\nanalyst to receive inag\xe2\x80\xa2s on tape, to display\nthe images, to classify them, and to display\nthe mults.

The signature\nis tested cell by cell against the user-selected\nthreshold (the default threshold is 1); that is,\nif the pixel count for a given cell is equal to\nor greater than the threshold value, it is\nretained; if less, it is discarded. For example,\na threshold of 1 would cause all empty cells to\nbe discarded. The result of this testing process\nis accumulated on an operator-selected theme\nstorage area (default is theme 1). At the conclusion of the theme synthesis, the original parallelepiped limits are set by the computer into\nthe signature analyzer threshold registers so\nthat the alarm will display the results of the\noriginal 1-D acquisition.\n\nTHRESHOLDING\n\n4-9\n\nUtilities\nW130= DISPLAY\t\n\nThe window display (MINDW) program provides the\ncapability to select an image area with the cursor,\nto expand that are* by a factor of an integer\nnumber, to train an the expanded area on a\nsingle-pixel basis (if desired), and to classify\nthe entire 512- by 512-pixel scene. Magnification is achieved by decreasing the cursor size\nand keeping the insert areas fixed at onesixteenth of the display area. The portion of\nthe screen overwritten by the expanded area can\nbe restored without further tape-input.\n\nSLICER\t\n\nThe slicer (SLICE) program is similar to the contrast stretch (STACH) program except that, instead\nof rewriting the video, a (selected) number of\nthemes are generated and written onto the refresh\ndevice. The exact range occupied by each theme\nis reported on the graphics display terminal.\n\nANNOTATION\t\n\nThe annotation program permits the user to enter\nalphanumeric text on a theme via the graphics\ndisplay terminal keyboard for display on the\ncolor CRT.\n\nCONTRAST\t\nSTRETCH\t\n\nThe STRCH program searches the data within the\ncursor for a given band, determines the maximum\nand minimum brightness values, and then rewrites\nthe entire band of imagery normalized to these\nvalues. The user may input maximum and minimum\nvalues as an option.\n\nTHEME\t\nEXCHANGE\t\n\nThe theme exchange (THEMEX) program performs a\ntheme exchanges i.e., if 1 and 3 are typed on the\ngraphics display terminal, themes 1 and 3 would\nreverse storage positions on the refresh memory.\nThis helps to achieve a better color balance for\nphotographic purposes.\n\nVIDEO EXCHANGE\t\n\nThe video exchange (VIDEX) program performs the\nsame function as the THEMEX program except that\nit operates on complete channels of imagery. The\neight themes are treated as one channel (band 5).\n\nTHEME AREAS\t\n\nThe theme areas (AREA) program reads the theme\n"totalizers," which are the digital counts of the\nthemes, the alarm, and the alarm gate. These are\nexpressed in CRT element counts, as well as in\nthe perc ,mt :c of the total disj)]Ay arca.\n\n}\n\nTAe lo49iaq file program creates a file of\n\nat\n\nLOGGING hr=\n\n"Waticas performed during machine training oa\ndhw cmqut w lisle ee othes storage media, provided the LOG switch is set (speQWAA b the\nVOW during P!{hlPA I S C . am awcecatioa .

To improve the quality of the\nimage, the analyst also has access to a scanner\nvideo averaging program.\n\nProcedure 1\t\n\nProcedure 1 is a classification hybrid system\nmethod that processes dots instead of training\nfields. It utilises both the Image 100 and the\nLACIE System in support of the LACIE CAMS, An\nXmge 100 user can now apply Procedure 1 to\nLACIE segments. This integrated system contains\nthe following programs.\n\nIMAGE DISPLAY The image display program allows the analyst to\ndisplay LACIE imagery in several ways for study\nusing Procedure 1.\nDO/DU FIELDS The designated other/designated unidentifiable\nfield definition (DO/DU FIELDS) program allows\nfields which have been excluded from clustering\nand classification to be defined interactively\nat the Image 100 console.\nSELECT AND\t\nDISPLAY DOTf\t\n\nSCATTER PLOT\t\n\n4-12\n\nThe select and display dots program allows the\nanalyst to select a subset of all dots in the\nLACIE segment and display them on the CRT.\nThe scatter plot program allows the user to generate scatter plots of any two spectral coordinates, including Kauth greenness and brightness.\n\nThe single-dot labeling with trajectory plots \t\nprogram allows the analyst to select a single\ndot, examine its trajectory through spectral\nspace, and label cc relabel it by category and\nhype.\n\nDOT LAMMING\n\nThe automatic cluster labeling program assigns \t\nlabels to each cluster using labeled dots.\n\nCLUSTER LAMMING\n\nThe oboter and ciassifict 4-ion map display\t\nprograms allow the analyst to display individual clusters, all clusters with a common label,\nand classes.\nThe reports program produces many detailed reports \t\nupon user request.\n\nMAP DISPLAY\n\nREPORTS\n\nTbe data base operations program provides far the\t\ninsertion or extraction of a aide variety of\t\ndata into or from the data beau,\n\nDATA But\nOPSPATIONS\n\nThe programs for of Mae updates of the CAMS \t\nImage 100 Data lase are maintained on the system\ndisk and are available for execution in the batch\n\nBATCH\n\nMOBS.\n\nThe classification and Mensuration Evaluation \t\nand Test (CAMET) programs were developed specifically as a -irst test of LACIE procedures in the\nImage 100 system. Although the CAMET programs\nare no longer needed for their original purpose,\nsome of the following available programs have\nproven useful.\nThe INWO program, CAMET version, oilers all the \t\ncapabilities of the 111120 program plus the capability of reading vertices from the file a\xc2\xbbd the\noption of displaying field boundcries only.\nThe M-D signature acquisition (CMDA2) program \t\ndetermines the multidimensional histogram for\t\nan area defined by the cursor, theme track, at\nalarm. The program uses a binary search procedure within the limits determined by the 1-D\nsignature acquisition program.

This\ninvolved processing data from functional check\nflights to determine sensor readiness for mission\ndata acquisition and from laboratory testa\nsupporting sensor development.\n\nGENERAL\n\nAlthough the SAL continues to support that function, it has also had the responsibility, since\nOctober 1977, to generate user data products for\nPrincipal Investigators (PI\'s) of the AIRP. The\nSAL also supports software development for AIRP\nsensors and is expected to provide data processing support for tests from Space Shuttle Orbiter\nncperiments.\nThe present capability utilizes both generalpurpose programs for the analysis of numerous\ntypes of sensor data and dedicated programs to\n\nsupport a specific type of data. The emtphasis\nis on providing a flexible configuration to\nacoowsiodato a wide range of applications.\nThe laboratory consists of an offlins system,\t\nan analog tape -dubbing station, a preprocessor\nsystem, and an online system.\n\nHARDWARE\n\nThe offline system consists of hardware units \t\ncapable of producing strip charts, visicorder\nproducts, and tape - to-film products. The tape\ntransport ( Model FR1900) is used to reproduce\nthe data from the aircraft sensor tapes on the\noffline system. The time code translators ( TCP\'s)\nare required to display the Inter - Range Instru-\n\n0 ffline\n\nmentation Gi oup (IRIG) time from the tapes. One\nof two decosmmutation systems, the ElectroMechanical Research (SMR) or the AMLD, is used\nto decode the bit streams of the various pulse\ncode modulation (PCM) formats. The decommutation\nsystems employ a bit, a frame, and a word synchronizer, as well as digital - to-analog converter outputs. After the data have been decommutated, the\n\nrequired output iS Ueterinined.\n7-1\n\nf-^\n\nWE= RECORDERS\t\n\nThe data signal from the deoommutation system\'s\n22 digital-to-analog converter outputs may be\npatched using the patch panel to one of the\nthree brush recorders for the production of\nstrip charts. Right parameters, one event mark,\nand slo-code time may be displayed on a strip\nchart. Paper speeds from 1 to 200 millimeters\nper second are available.\n\nVISICORDERS\t\n\nVisicorder products may be produced for any given\nchannel of data. for visicorder strip charts, the\nmagazine is loaded with the appropriate paper\nroll. Screeni products for the modular multiband scanner (M S or MMS) and the NASA multispectral sensor 001 (NS 001MS) are generated on\nthis visicorder.\n\nREMOTE FILM\t\nRECORDER\t\n\nThe remote film recorder 70 (RrR-70) is a tapeto-film converter used to make screening film\nproducts for the M 2S, the RS-18W, and the\nMSOOIMS. One channel, as selected, can be produced as output on 70-millimeter black-and-white\nfilm. One-minute timing marks are also incorporated onto the film.\n\nstation\nAnalog Tape-Dubbing The tape-dubbingcopies ofhas the hardware necesnary to produce\noriginal aircraft senStation\t\nsor tapes. Analog tape transport* (Models TR1900\nand lR2000) and accompanying patch panels and\ntest equipment are used to make copies of these\nsensor tapes. The >! OOO is used for reproduction, whereas the M1900 is used for recorbing,\nNow tape# can be generated, also, if proper signals\nare available from senscr laboratories via hardlines or using simulated signals. The capability\nto generate IRIG time is also available.\n\nOnline and\t\nPreprocessing\t\n\n7-2\n\nThe UL online and preprocessing configurations\nare shown in the following diagrams.\n\n\t\n\n65401\n9\t\n\ne\t\n\t\n\nwe\t\nCol I\nWill\t\n\n91111\t\n041\t\n\nww.rrw\n\nI\n\nKnew""D\n\nIris\nan\n\n^^\nwr wN\nSI M\n\non"""\n\ne+mr\n\nmom\n\n^ ^\t\n\n"Manta\n\nw nee\t\n\n\t\na\t\n\n^i\t\n\n\'tM0"\'\n\nMa\t\n\n^\n\nK\n\nI-111011110\nWO\n\n^\n\nWill\n\nlarlAm" configuration for the\n\nPW\n\n11/70\n\nonline systM for the SAL.\n\nf\nf\ni\n\nWW4Wl\t\n\naa^r\n\nlow\t\n\nUfa Pam\n\nI\t 1\t _1 l\n\nWOOL t\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\\ n^w^ !\t\n\n\t\n,..,^\xe2\x80\x9e\t\n"Neft SW\n\nen"T"a;\n\nl\t\n\nn\n\ne\xe2\x80\xa2n^r\n\n^Tw\t\n\n11/fe\t\n\nlelNKt\t\n\n.a wrT\n\nyt!^\'^\t\n\ntall\t\n\nSIX\ni c\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2sla\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nINTO, \t\n\nAOITTI^\t\n\n\'I tea\t\n\neli\xe2\x80\xa2lN\n\nTt.aw\n\nwT t\n\nT\n\n1\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x96\xba1R\t\n\n4O,00 1\xe2\x80\xa2M\t\n\nno 110ttT\n\nHardware configuration for the ADP 11/15\npreprocessing system for the SAL.\n\n7-3\n\n.....\n\nSOFTWARE\t\n\nThe sensor evaluation software utilises the\nResource Sharing Executive, Model 11M (RSX-111),\nv rsios 3.0, operating system. The RSX-11M supports NRCRO-11 (version 6.0]) assembly language\nand Fortran IV Plus (version 2.5) programming.\nNumerous utility support programs are also\ninoladed. Amwq these are Test Editor, Linker,\nPeripheral interchange Program (PIP), Piledump,\nassembler (URCRO-11), Portran Compiler, Online\nDebugging Technique (ODT) , Library, and indirect\nComm" File capabilities.\nThe R4X -11X is-a multiuser operating system that\npermits more efficient utilization of system\nresources. It is a disk-based real-time operating system that provides an environment for the\nexecution of multiple real-time tasks (program\nImages) using a priority-structured, event-driven\nscheduling mechanism.\nThe RSX -111 can be generated as either a mapped\nor an unmapped system, depending on the requiremants of the sensor support or the user data\nproducts, thmmapped systems support only usercontrolled partitions. Napped systems support\nboth user-controlled and system-controlled partitions. Services Mich require memory-mapping\nhasdwre are provided by the memory management\nunit (Model XT11).\n\n.\t\n\nThe following is a summary of the programs Aich\nhave been developed over the past 1 years. They\nare used.for generating user data products, providing quality control of processed data, performing routine utility tasks, and processing\ndata from roll inactive sensors. Close rapport\nwith the sensor engineer, detailed knowledge of\nthe data, and basic understanding of the hardware\nand software in the Blal. have led to the capability to provide a timely and effective product and\na high degree of confidence in the results. in\neach case, numerous diagnostic and verification\nprocedures have been adopted to assure the accu-\n\nracy and reliability of the processing.\n\nUser Data\t\nPmduet Generation \t\n\n7-a\n\nThe following computer programs are utilized to\n\ngenerate user data products for the Pile.\n\nThe NASA Earth resources (NER) program generates\nNASA Earth Resources Data Annotation System\n(NERDAS) guidance and navigation tabulations at\none sample per second versus NERDAS time. The\nNER program can process NERDAS data from either\nthe RB-57F or the C-130 aircraft. [The sensor\nformat is described in the Data Format Control\nBook (DFCB), JSC-13896, page 4-36.1\n\n\'..\t\n\nNASA EARTH\nRESOURCES\n\nThe NER1 program outputs the same information\nas NER at 10 samples per second.\nThe NERDAS for Alaska Mapping Project (NERA)\nprogram outputs the same information as NER\nexcept a three-digit line number is in the site\nnumber slot and ALASKA is hard coded in the line\nnumber slot.\n\nNERA\n\nThe uncorrected camera correlation (NCAC) program\ngenerates uncorrected camera correlation tabulations from the RB-57F and C-130 aircraft. A\nmaximum of 300 frames may be captured at one\ntime, and a summary total is generated. (The\nformat of the tabulations is described in the\nDFCB, page 4-34.)\n\nUNCORRECTED\nCAMERA\nCORRELATION\n\nThe corrected camera correlation (CAMERA) program\ngenerates corrected camera correlation tabulations (as in the NCAC program) and a corrected\nOCT.

The following equipment is used by\nthis laboratory to aid in analyzing geometric\nproblems.\n\nGeneral\n\nHardware\nThe Wang 720B and the Hewlett-Packard 9100E \t\n(HP9100B) are self-contained programmable elec- \t\ntronic calculators that can accept taped pro-\t\ngrams. The outputs are numerical and visual\ndisplays and hardcopy printouts of programmed\ndata.\nThe Gerber 1275 Graphic Display System is an \t\nautomated drafting system with two major com-\t\nponents: (1) a large flatbed drafting table\nwhich supports an electrically powered traveling bridge that carries an electronically controlled plotting head over a useful plotting\narea of 60 by 144 inches and (2) a control\ncabinet containing an electronic computer with\nan 8-kiloword memory and an input/output teletypewriter and magnetic tape reader. Input data\nnormally are entered from magnetic tapes especially formatted for the Gerber plotter on an\noffline electronic computer. X- and Y-coordinates\nare given in inches. Output normally consists\nof lines either drafted in ink on paper or film\nor exposed on light-sensitive photographic film.\nThis system has the following major capabilities:\n\nWANG 720E AND\nHEWLETT-PACKARD 9100E\nCALCULATORS\n\nGERBER 1275 GRAPHIC\nDISPLAY SYSTEM\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Plotting accuracy of 5 mils\ns Notting speed to 500 inches per minute\nti-1\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nDWDIX 100 IDS\n\'\n\na\n\n4* `\ni\n\nRSS-400 GRAPHIC\nQUANTIZER\n\n-\n\n1"Aual seal*-changinq capability frca\n0.00001 to 999.99999.\nOffsetting of locations from O to\n1999.999 inches.\n\nThe Bendix 100 IDS consists of the following\n(1) a 42- by 60-inch\nthree major components:\t\nlight table, a free-moving cursor with control\nbuttons, and an electronic Dataqrid digitiser\nhaving an accuracy of 0.005 inchi\t (2) a Nova 1220\nelectronic computer with 32-kiloword core storage, magnetic storage disks, Fortran IV software,\nand magnetic tape station; and (3) CRT terminals\nwith teletype keyboards and an electrostatic\nimage duplicator.\t The Nova computer is programmed to produce magnetic tapes for use on the\nGarber 1275 plotter, including a wide variety of\npreprogrammed letters, numbers, and symbols.\nThe computer also can be programmed for computation work, such as transforming map projections.\nThe Sendix 100 IDS involves three basic steps:\n(1) digitizing the graphics,\t (2) proofreading\nand editing results on the CRT or teletype diaplay, and (3) producing a magnetic tape for\nreproduction on the Gerber plotter at any desired\nscale or for input to another system. \t\n\nf\n\nThe RSS-400 graphic quantizer is an example of\nthe application of integrated circuitry for converting graphics to digital form.\t The 48- by\n72-inch table will accommodate maps, graphs,\nstrip charts, and design drawings. \t Any point\nor line lon the graph can be digitally scaled\nand recorded.\t Measurements in the X- and\t\nY-directions and areas can be recorded.\t Any\ngraph can be input for measurement or calculation of the enclosed area.\t Visual digital data\nand punched cards of the readings are output.\nThe printout shows the measurement of the \t\nX-coordinate, followed by the measurement of the\nY-coordinate.\t This machine is presently on loan\nto the Baylor Medical Center in Eiouston, Texas.\n\nI.\n\n1_\n\n\'.\n\n1\n\nThe H. Dell Fbster digitizer is an automated\t\nmensuration system with three major oomponentsi\t\n(1) a glass-topped, back-lighted, drafting table\nwhich supports a traveling bridge that carries a\nwanually operated cursor and electric X--and\nY-coordinate distance sensors; (2) an electronic\ndigitizer= and (3) a teletype printer with punched\npaper tape output. The X- and Y-coordinate disG n .e :Rnsors on the traveling bridge measure\nwith an accuracy of 0.001 inch. Scale factors\nmay be manually introduced (from 0.0001 to\n9.9999) so that the measurements are converted\nautomatically into any convenient units of area\nor distance. JSC has computer equipment that\nwill use the punched paper tape to produce\npunched cards.\nThe Mann comparator, type 1210, is a precision \t\nscrew instrument designed specifically for meas- \t\nusing X- and Y-coordinates on photographic materials to an accuracy of \xc2\xb10.001 millimeter. This\nhigh-quality instrument outputs formatted data\n(such as X- and Y-coordinates and point identifications) through a digitizer (data logger)\nonto punched cards for use in various computer\nprograms. This instrument is best suited for\nperforming accurate mensuration on photographic\nfilm or glass plates, regardless of the imagery\nsource. A Zoom viewing system with interchangeable eyepieces provides 5X to 20X magnification.\nThis instrument has a 9- by 18-inch measuring\nformat. Computer programs permit reconstruction\nof even larger photographic formats.\nThe multiscale stereo point marker is a device \t\nfor stereoscopically transferring conjugate\t\npoints from one photograph to another. A continuous Zoom viewing system on this instrument\nallows conjugate images to be matched using\nphotography of widely varying scales (from\napproximately 2X to 48X). Points are burned\ninto the emulsion by a thermal die to provide a\npermanent unambiguous record of the point. The\ndiameter at the die mark is approximately\n40 micrometers.\n\nH.

The instrument is equipped with a\n2X-to-SX enlarging or SX-to-2X reducing pantograph. Inputs consist of photographic transparencies (glass plates or film having formats\nup to 23 by 23 centimeters) acquuired with wideor superwide-angle cameras. It is most suitable\nfor producing medium- to large-scale maps\n(lt20 000 or larger).\n\nWILD PUG-3 POINT\t\n\nThe Wild PUG-3 stereoscopic point transfer device\nis used for transferring conjugate points from\none overlapping photograph to another. The\ndevice drills a 60-micrometer-diameter hole in\nthe emulsion of film or glass plate to provide\na permanent, unambiguous record of the point.\nPoint transfer is restricted to photographic\ntransparencies of approximately the same scale.\n\ns\t\n\nTRANSFER DEVICE\t\n\nANALYTICAL STEREOPLOTTER \t\n\nThe analytical stereoplotter (AS-llB1) is a\nstereophotogrammetric system using a programmable\ndigital computer for real-time stereamodel computations and electromechanical control of a\nhigh-precision stereocomparator. Input formats\nto this system are limited to 9 by 18 inches and\nnormally consist of stereopairs, positional\ninformation to reference these photographs to\na surface, and data to compensate for nonprojective effects (e.g., curvature, atmospheric\nrefraction, lens distortion, and image motion\ncompensation). The outputs include profile,\ncontour, and planimetric plots; ground and model\ncoordinates (three dimensional); photograph\ncoordinates; and orientation parameters of the\nphotographs. Digital data are output via paper\ntape, magnetic tape, and teletype printout.\nVarious types of imagery have been reduced using\n\nb-a\n\n7y\n\n\t\n\nf\t\n\n,\n\n3\n\nthis system. Products from the following\nequipment may be processed: conventional aerial\ncameras (metric cameras of various focal\nlengths), the Apollo 70-millimeter Hasselblad\n(nonsetric cameras of various focal lengths),\n16-millimeter movie cameras, Wild stereometric\ncameras, and the scanning electron microscope\n(SEX) .\nGIGA-ZEISS\nORTHOPROJECTOR\n\nThe Wild camera goniometer is a 300-pound optical \t\ninstrument used to calibrate survey cameras U.e., \t\nto determine the principal point of the camera\'s\nfocal plane and the effective focal length of its\nlens). This device consists of a frame that supports the observing telescope, a collimated light\nsource, and an intermediate cylindrical frame that\ncontains the camera body. The goniometer is used\nto observe a calibrated reseau grid (glass plate)\nmounted in the camera\'s focal plane.\n\n!\t\n\nThe Gig&-Zeiss orthoprojector is a projection- \t\ntype instrument used for the production of ortho- \t\nphotographs (photomaps).. The instrument uses\nprofile (cross-section) data generated by the\nAS-1191 to accomplish a strip-by-strip rectification of aerial photographs (transforming central\nperspective photographs into parallel projection\nimages). Both color and black-and-white orthophotographs may be produced using this instrument.\nPhotography acquired with cameras having focal\nlengths of 6, 8-1/4, and 12 inches may be plotted\ndirectly with the projecting cameras presently\navailable. Other focal lengths may be accommodated through the use of photographic techniques,\nproviding a wide selection of final orthophotograph (photomap) scales. This instrument also\npossesses the capability to produce a droppedline contour chart giving direct hypsographic\ninformation on the terrain being reproduced as\nan orthophotograph (photomap). The Giga-Zeiss\northoprojector can accommodate photographic formats as large as 9-1/2 by 9-1/2 inches and\naccepts either film or glass plates.\n\nWILD CAMERA\nGONIOMETER\n\n8-5\nk\n\nBW\n-\n\nSoftware\nWAM PR0GRA14S\t\n\nThe Wang calculator has programs available that\n\nwill convert geographies to Universal Transverse\nMercator, Lambert, and state plane coordinates.\nOther programs include data adjustment, resection (computation of spatial orientation for a\nspecified aerial photograph), image blur plotting\nfor panoramic or frame camera images, and computation of lens distortion curve coefficients.\nHP9100B PROGRAMS\t\n\nThe HP9100B calculator has programs available\nthat will convert Universal Transverse Mercator\nto geographic coordinates, local coordinates to\ngeographic coordinates, and geographic to local\ncoordinates and that will compute the lunar slant\nrange and surface distances of images and lens\ndistortion curve coefficients (less than eight\ndistortion coefficients).\n\nBENDIX 100 IDS\t\n\nThe basic Bendix 100 IDS software is overlay\nconstructed with the core resident program\nmaking decisions as to what function or operation is requested. At present the basic system\ncontains two startup, eight main overlay, and\nfive special functions programs.\n\nPROGRAMS\t\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The startup program initializes the files and\nsystem from the user disk.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The warm start program initializes the system\nafter certain shutdowns or system failures\nfrom fixed disk have occurred.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 PROG1 handles most menu hits and digitizing,\noutputs to terminal, and selects modes.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 PR0G2 sets up menu origin and receives\nnumeric inputs from keyboards.\nhandles the store file, recall file,\nlist file, and new file select functions.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 PROG3\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 PROG4\n\nhandles the edit functions MODIFY,\nand MOVE except for TRAP MOVE or TRAP\n\nDELETE,\nDELETE.\n\nB-G\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 PROGS handles TRAP MOVE and TRAP DELETE.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 PROG6 SIGNOFF shuts down the system and\nreturns control to the monitor.\ne PROG7 has two versions: the slain station,\nwhich controls, pauses, starts, and restarts\nthe plotters and the remote station, which\nintercepts attempts to control the plotter\nfrom remote stations.\ne FROGS converts a system drawing file and\nassociated symbol file into a sequential XDOS\nbinary file.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The background plotting program performs a\nplotting operation in the background mode.\nThe plot data are output to digital tape for\nuse on the Gerber plotter.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The polygon output (POLYOUT) program writes\nthe digitized vertices of polygons on magnetic tape for use on other systems. Each\npolygon is preceded by text identifiers\n(field number and crop code). The identifier\nis used as the reference point for the polygons. This program is used in the accuracy\nassessment task of LACIE.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The polygon delete (POLYDEL) program deletes\na polygon from the current drawinq/SCR files.\ne The Bendix 100 IDS (B-100) Flot program provides a simple means of visually comparing an\noverlay showing field boundaries and the\ndigitized Bendix 100 IDS data.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The boundary detection and registration\n(BDARPI) program provides boundary plots\n(polygons) from classified data sets. The\nprogram will process one class at a timer\ntherefore, for multiple classes, the program\nmust be run for each class desired.\n\n8-7\n\n1\'\'!\n\n\t\n\t\n\nMAP COMPILATION AND\nPRODUCTION CAPABILITIES\nGeneral\t\n\nThe CTL has extensive capabilities for the compilation and production of maps from Earth\nresources data.
