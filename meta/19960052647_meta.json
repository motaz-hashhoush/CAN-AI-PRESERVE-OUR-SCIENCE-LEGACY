This paper describes four of these. In one, a duplex voice link between an aeronautical terminal on the LeRC Learjet and the ACTS was achieved. Two others demonstrated duplex voice (and in one case video as well) links between the ACTS and an Army vehicle. The fourth demonstrated a high data rate downlink from ACTS to a fixed terminal. Array antenna systems used in these demonstrations were developed by LeRC and featured LeRC and Air Force experimental arrays using gallium arsenide MMIC devices at each radiating element for electronic beam steering and distributed power amplification. The single 30 GHz transmit array was developed by NASA/LeRC and Texas Instruments. The three 20 GHz receive arrays were developed in a cooperative effort with the Air Force Rome Laboratory, taking advantage of existing Air Force array development contracts with Boeing and Lockheed Martin. The paper describes the four proof-of-concept arrays and the array control system. The system configured for each of the demonstrations is described, and results are discussed.", "title": "MMIC Phased Array Demonstrations with ACTS", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-17T12:52:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19960052647, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Raquet, Charles A."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Lewis Research Center", "location": "Cleveland, OH United States"}}, "id": "a29fc3be688e4fa2904092d2812a6ce1"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19960052647, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Martzaklis, Konstantinos"}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Lewis Research Center", "location": "Cleveland, OH United States"}}, "id": "58a6663dd8124a2eba2f16f8525ae64e"}, {"sequence": 2, "submissionId": 19960052647, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Zakrajsek, Robert J."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Lewis Research Center", "location": "Cleveland, OH United States"}}, "id": "f0464e614d12428a8e2c37cc3c915646"}, {"sequence": 3, "submissionId": 19960052647, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Andro, Monty"}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Lewis Research Center", "location": "Cleveland, OH United States"}}, "id": "82f58173bd3c428bb6bdee5bab876696"}, {"sequence": 4, "submissionId": 19960052647, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Turtle, John P."}, "organization": {"name": "Rome Lab.", "location": "Hanscom AFB, MA United States"}}, "id": "8c92f23c29c14add81a2e02b7e79297a"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-19T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19960052647, "publications": [{"volume": "Part 1", "submissionId": 19960052647, "id": "be936b14eaf641e29f3bdf27db918732", "publicationName": "Advanced Communication Technology Satellite Results Conference", "publicationDate": "1996-05-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
