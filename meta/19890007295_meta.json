These studies are essential to providing ground-truth support for observations of the solar system by NASA's missions, including the VOYAGER and GALILEO spacecraft, the Hubble Space Telescope, and the proposed CRAF-Cassini mission. Complementary spectroscopic observations of comets were added in BY88 to support NASA's cometary program goals of the CRAF-Cassini mission. A very modest laboratory effort is also maintained to provide essential data needed by these observational programs, which may be otherwise unavailable. Many accomplishments during BY88 include: (1) discovery of HDO in the spectrum of Mars and the first determination of the D/H ratio in its atmosphere; (2) completion and publication of the study of CH3D in the spectrum of Titan and a determination of the mixing ratio in its atmosphere; and, completion of observations of CH3D in the spectrum of Neptune and a preliminary analysis of the CH3D/CH4 mixing ratio in its atmosphere.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19890007295, "id": "8994eccd3ae54cb080df716339c62899", "publicationName": "NASA, Washington, Reports of Planetary Astronomy,", "publicationDate": "1988-08-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19890007295.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19890007295/downloads/19890007295.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19890007295/downloads/19890007295.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19890007295/downloads/19890007295.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
