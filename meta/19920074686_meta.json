Techniques required for floating zone melting of cadmium telluride are being developed. We have successfully float-zoned cadmium telluride on earth using square rods. A resistance heater was constructed for forming the molten zone. Evaporation of the molten zone was controlled by adding excess cadmium to the growth ampoule combined with heating of the entire ampoule. An effective method to hold the feed rod was developed. Slow rotation of the growth ampoule was proven experimentally to be necessary to achieve a complete symmetric molten zone. Most of the resultant cylindrical rods were single crystals with twins. Still needed is a suitable automatic method to control the zone length. We tried a fiber optical technique to control the zone length, but experiments showed that application of this technique to automate zone length control is unlikely to be successful.", "title": "Floating zone melting of cadmium telluride", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-15T16:54:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19920074686, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Chang, Wen-Ming"}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Headquarters", "location": "Washington, DC United States"}}, "id": "dcc09ff258a54ab4825c072fcf159cb6"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19920074686, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Regel, L.
