The next logical frequency to develop for deep space is the Ka-band (32 GHz) for which a primary deep space allocation of 500 MHz between 31.8 to 32.3 GHz was established in 1979. The telecommunications capability was improved by a factor of 77 (18.9 dB) through the frequency changes from L-band to X-band. Another improvement factor of 14.5 (11.6 dB) can be achieved by going to Ka-band. Plans to develop and demonstrate Ka-band capability include the continued measurement of weather effects at Deep Space Network (DSN) sites, development of a prototype DSN ground antenna and supporting subsystems, augmentation of planned spacecraft with Ka-band beacons, and development of spacecraft prototype modules for future Ka-band transmitters. Plans for augmenting the DSN with Ka-band capability by 1995 were also developed. A companion set of articles describes the Ka-band performance and technology in greater detail.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19870008523, "id": "8e0bf553a76f4d7dac05671c3e6df155", "publicationName": "The Telecommunications and Data Acquisition Report", "publicationDate": "1987-02-15T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19870008523.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19870008523/downloads/19870008523.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19870008523/downloads/19870008523.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19870008523/downloads/19870008523.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
