While a few contractors have had a high level of visibility in major NASA programs,\nthe initiative, imagination and productivity of thousands of small business concerns, including small\ndisadvantaged business concerns and women-owned business concerns, have contributed significantly\nto the success of NASA\'s programs.\nVarious studies and NASA experience have found that these business concerns can\nprovide a vital and significant impetus to technological innovation, not only in the fields of space\nand aeronautics, but also in national technological growth. NASA personnel are determined to\nfoster the development of small business capabilities in technical areas that will support future\nprojects and establish a small business base for the development and production of flight hardware\nfor future missions.\nWe realize that the solicitation process for Federal contracts has grown quite complex\nover the years. Where possible, we continue to try to simplify and streamline procedures for\nobtaining and performing these contracts. This booklet is designed to help you understand NASA\nsolicitations, find the information you need in deciding whether to respond, and improve your\nchances for success.\nThe first section of this booklet will answer your general questions concerning the\nvarious types of NASA solicitations. Your specific questions on how to prepare bids will be\nanswered in the second section, which is followed by a third section on the unique features of\nconstruction contracting. A fourth section describes how to submit technical and cost proposals for\nthe negotiated procurement process. Some tips or suggestions, called DOs and DON\'Ts, are placed\nat the end of the second, third, and fourth sections. Then, in the fifth section, ways to seek business\nas a subcontractor are identified.\nNASA\'s Small Business Specialists (addresses are found in the fifth section) are ready to\nrespond to any question you may have regarding ways in which to improve your success rate in\nNASA procurements. They can also provide you with additional information you may need.\n\nL. E. Hopkins\t\nCompetition Advocate\t\n\nS. I.

This\nbooklet describes two procurement methods:\nsealed bidding, which uses a form of solicitation called the Invitation for Bids (IFB), and\nnegotiated procurement, which uses the\nRequest for Proposals (RFP). Other procurement methods are described below.\nContracts may also result from receipt of\nunsolicited proposals. \xe2\x80\xa2\nSmall Business Innovation\nResearch\nSmall business concerns may participate in\nthe Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR)\nprogram. SBIR program objectives include\nstimulating technological innovation in the\nprivate sector, strengthening the role of small\nbusiness concerns in meeting Federal\nresearch and development needs, increasing\nthe commercial application of Federally\nsupported research results, and fostering and\nencouraging participation by minority and\ndisadvantaged persons in technological\ninnovation. Additional information and\ncurrent solicitations may be obtained from\nthe NASA SBIR Program, Code CR,\nWashington, DC 20546.\nNASA Research Announcements\nand Announcements of Opportunity\nNASA issues announcements called the\nNASA Research Announcement (NRA) and\nthe Announcement of Opportunity (AO).\nNRAs and AOs encourage the submission of\np roposa ls for specific research projects in\nareas of interest to NASA. Detailed instructions for submitting proposals are found in\neach NRA and AO.\n\nNASA publicizes these announcements in\navailable in\nmany public libraries and from:\n\nthe Commerce Business Daily,\n\nSuperintendent of Documents\nGovernment Printing Office\nWashington, DC 20402\n(Telephone 202-783-3238)\nSection 8(a) Program\nNASA also awards contracts under Section\n8(a) of the Small Business Act. Small business\nconcerns owned and controlled by socially\nand economically disadvantaged individuals\nmay be eligible for the Small Business\nAdministration\'s 8(a) Program. Information\nmay be obtained by contacting any Small\nBusiness Specialist listed in Section 5 of this\nbooklet.\nUnsolicited Proposals\nNASA encourages the submission of\nunsolicited proposals as described in\n"Guidance for the Preparation and Submission of Unsolicited Proposals," available from\nthe following unsolicited proposal coordinating offices.\nNASA Headquarters\nOffice of Space Science and Applications\nCode EPM-20\nWashington, DC 20546\nNASA Ames Research Center\nUniversity Affairs Office, Code 241-25\nMoffett Field, CA 94035\nNASA Goddard Space Flight Center\nProgram Procurement Division\nCode 280.1\nGreenbelt, MD 20771\n\nInitiation of the Procurement\n\nNASA Goddard/Wallops Flight Facility\nIndustry Assistance Office\nCode 244.1\nWallops Island, VA 23337\n\nTypically, the procurement process starts\nwhen a program or project office determines\na need and submits a request to the procurement office. The contracting officer prepares\na solicitation in the form of either an\nInvitation for Bids (IFB) or a Request for\nProposals (RFP). Except under unusual circumstances, solicitations are issued after\nannouncement in the Commerce Business\nDaily at least 30 days before bids or offers\nare due.\n\nNASA Johnson Space Center\nProcurement Operations, Code BD35\nHouston, TX 77058\nNASA Kennedy Space Center\nProcurement Office, Code SI-PRO-B\nKennedy Space Center, FL 32899\nNASA Langley Research Center\nAcquisition Division\nM/S 126/Grants Officer\nHampton, VA 23665\n\nThe installation\'s source files are used to\ndevelop a bidders mailing list that includes\nsources recommended by the program or\nproject office and sources who request the\nsolicitation announced in the Commerce\nBusiness Daily. NASA\'s source files are\nbased on Bidder\'s Mailing List Applications\n(Standard Form 129) submitted by prospective contractors. To obtain a Standard Form\n129, contact any Small Business Specialist\nlisted in Section 5 of this booklet.\n\nNASA Lewis Research Center\nUnsolicited Proposal Coordinator/\nGrants Officer\nMail Stop 500-306\n2100 Brookpark Road\nCleveland, OH 44135\nNASA Marshall Space Flight Center\nPlanning and Support Branch\nAttn: AP16\nMarshall Space Flight Center, AL 35812\n\nSealed Bidding\nEach IFB includes technical specifications,\ndelivery or completion dates, place and\nmethod of delivery, nature and number of\nreports or manuals required, tests and\n\nNASA Stennis Space Center\nScience and Technology Laboratory\nStennis Space Center, MS 39529-6000\n\np\n\'p\n\nThe National Space Technology Laboratories near Bay St. Louis, Mississippi \r\nwas named the John C. Stennis Space Center on May 20, 1988\n\n2\n\ninstructions, and other items to be considered in submitting a bid. Contract clauses,\nterms, and conditions are set forth, as are the\ndate, time, and place where bids will be\npublicly opened and recorded. (For more\ndetails on sealed bidding, see Section 2. See\nSection 3 for unique features applying to construction contracts\nNegotiated Procurement\nNASA awards most of its procurement\ndollars through the use of negotiated procurements, especially ones for research and\ndevelopment. Lack of adequate or definitive\nspecifications and the need for a greater\ndegree of flexibility in arriving at the desired\ntechnical approach result in the use of this\ntechnique. Negotiation permits the evaluation of differing approaches and consideration of many other factors in selecting a contractor, while sealed bidding limits consideration almost entirely to price.\nOffers received by the closing date and\ntime are evaluated. (The terms "offer" and\n"proposal" are used interchangeably\nthroughout this booklet.) NASA may conduct\nnegotiations with firms which have a possibility of receiving an award based on their proposals. NASA awards a contract based on a\nthorough analysis of the proposals and the\nresults of any negotiations. (See Section 4 of\nthis booklet for more details.)\nIn addition to RFPs, NASA sometimes issues\nRequests for Quotations (RFQs), using Standard Form 18. An RFQ seeks information for\nplanning purposes but does not indicate that\nNASA will necessarily award a contract.\nBasic\nConsiderations\nThere are certain elements which must be\nunderstood by anyone who chooses to bid or\npropose on a NASA procurement. The following are a few of these:\n\nIt can be determined by examining Block\n4 of the Solicitation (Standard Form 33)\nwhether the procurement is Sealed\nBid (IFB), requiring a bid, or whether it is\nNegotiated (RFP), requiring a proposal.\nTo determine what must be provided to\nNASA in the way of of a response, be\nsure to read the "Instructions, Conditions,\nand Notices to Offerors" in Section L of\nthe solicitation.\nSome procurements are "set-aside" for\nsmall business or labor surplus area concerns. Under set-asides, only those\ntypes of concerns identified in Section L\nof the solicitation may be considered for\naward.\nWhenever a particular manufacturer\'s\npart number is called for, it can be determined from the specifications whether\n"Brand Name or Equal" language is\nincluded that may permit a substitution\nand to what extent.\nExplanation to\nProspective\nBidders\nor Offerors\nExplanation regarding the solicitation,\ndrawings, specifications, and so forth, can be\nobtained from the contracting officer, as\ndescribed in Section L of the solicitation.\nAny substantive information that is furnished to clarify the solicitation will be put in\nwriting and given by the contracting officer\nto all prospective bidders or offerors. The\ninformation will be furnished in the form of\na written amendment to the solicitation (Standard Form 30). This procedure assures that\nall offerors are on an equal footing and that\nanyone who makes an offer to NASA is\noffering on the some basis as all others.\n\nSOLICITATION, OFFER AND AWARD\n\nIS\nIt THIS CONTRACTCFRRATED ORDER\nUNDER OPAS (15\n350)\nSEALED BID IIFB)\nNEGOTIATED (RFP)\n\nCODE\n\nNOTE: In sealed bid solicitations "offer\' and "offeror" mean "bid" and "bidder".\n\nSOLICITATION\n9.

Proposals will be requested and\nevaluated.\n2. NASA may request clarification of the\nproposals or, after evaluation, may award a\ncontract without clarification, discussion, or\nnegotiation if the solicitation so provides.\n\nIf so, the detailed requirements for the proposal will be spelled out in Section 1 of the\nsolicitation.\nKeep in mind that NASA evaluates what\nthe offeror proposes, not what the offeror\nintended but failed to state. To achieve a\nfavorable technical evaluation, it is important\nto examine the evaluation factors in Section\nM carefully and consider them in the context\nof preparing the technical proposal.\n\n3. The basis for award will include:\na. Mission suitability (technical factors)\nb. Cost (price factors).\nc. Relevant experience and past performance.\n\nIn order to score high technically, the\nofferor must submit all the technical information requested in a manner that--\n\nd. Other considerations.\nWhile these factors are typical, an offeror\nmust always examine the evaluation factors\nin Section M of the solicitation since factors\nmay vary from RFP to RFP.\n\na. Is easily followed;\nb. Convinces the reader that the\nproposal meets all requirements of the RFP;\nand\n\nNegotiated procurement differs from\nsealed bidding in two major respects:\n\nc. Clearly demonstrates for the\nreader the advantages of the proposed\napproach for NASA.\n\n1. Selection in negotiated procurement is\nbased on a combination of factors rather than\nlowest price alone.\n\nNASA has found that proposals selected\nfor award provide evidence of the following:\n\n2. A negotiated procurement provides\ngreater flexibility in defining the work that\nwill be performed to meet NASA\'s needs.\nSealed bidding requires that performance be\nprecisely defined before soliciting bids for a\nfixed price.\n\na. Understanding of the requirement\nas described in the offeror\'s own words, and\nas demonstrated by the proposed approach.\nIn other words, how does the offeror intend\nto complete each step of the work under the\n\n17\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\n.\t \xe2\x80\xa2.\t ,,\n\nRFP and does this approach demonstrate that\nthe offeror understands the procurement\nrequirement?\n\nprices should be omitted since that data will\nbe part of the pricing proposal.\nWhat About\nthe Pricing\nProposal?\n\nb. Ability to perform the lob as reflected\nin the proposed work plans and the identification of resources required to perform the lob.\n\nRFPs require more detailed pricing information for evaluation of proposals than IFBs\nrequire for sealed bids.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Usually, this can be demonstrated by\nlisting the planned hours of work, by various\nskill levels, corresponding to the scheduled\ntask performance.\n\nThe requirements for a cost or pricing proposal should be reviewed in order to assure\nthat the information is furnished in the detail\nrequested using Standard Form (SF) 1411 for\ncost or pricing proposals.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 When showing staffing data in the\ntechnical proposal, data on salaries and\n\nCONTRACT PRICING PROPOSAL COVER SHEET \t\n\n11.

Score them using the evaluation\nfactors.\n\nParticular attention should be given to the\nneed for furnishing substantiating information in sufficient detail to support the summary information covered in the SF 1411.\n\nRegulations require that a proposal be\nevaluated by NASA on the basis of the stated\nfactors. They also require that an offeror\'s\napproach not be divulged in the evaluation\nprocess to other contenders.\n\nThe purpose of the Reference column on\nthe SF 1411 is to lead the evaluator to the\nplace in the pricing proposal where the\ndetailed data substantiating the price offered\nfor a line item are contained.\n\nNASA will make a competitive range determination, that is, a determination of those\nfirms having a reasonable chance of being\nselected for the final award. Those offerors\nnot in the competitive range will be notified\nby NASA. NASA may award a contract based\non the most favorable initial proposal without\ndiscussion if the solicitation so provides.\n\nThe pricing form must be signed by an\nofficial authorized to legally bind the firm\nsubmitting the proposal.\nWhat About\nAlternate\nProposals?\n\nWhen the NASA Contracting Officer sees\nthat it is desirable to obtain additional information on proposals, discussions will be held\nwith every offeror in the competitive range.\n\nIf an alternate approach would offer NASA\nsome advantage over an approach\nsought by the RFP, it normally may be submitted. However, for the alternate proposal\nto be considered, a fully responsive basic proposal must be submitted.\n\nWhen this phase has been concluded, firms\nin the competitive range will be asked to\nsubmit to NASA their revised proposals by a\ncommon cut-off date and time.\n\nAlternate proposals must be complete and\nnot require reference to the basic proposal.\nThey usually must offer a clearly unique\ntechnical advantage or a substantial cost\nsavings.\n\nIt is important to note that the request\nfrom NASA for revised proposals\nsignifies that all discussions have been\nconcluded and that there is a deadline\nby which firms must submit any revised\noffer if they are to remain in the\ncompetition.\n\nWhat Happens\nto the Proposal\nAfter It Is\nSubmitted?\n\nNASA will do a final evaluation to consider\nrevised proposals and then select a\ncontractor--\n\nThe proposal must be received at the\ndesignated place before the date and time set\nfor receipt of proposals.

The Government reserves the right to award, under either the required delivery schedule or the\n\nPage 9\nW10 .43764/HWC\t\n\nSection F\n\nproposed delivery schedule, when an offeror offers an earlier delivery schedule than required above.

Therefore, the offeror should compute the time available for performance\nbeginning with the actual date of award, rather than the date the written notice of award is received from\nthe Contracting Officer through the ordinary mails. However, the Government will evaluate an offer that\nproposes delivery based on the Contractor\'s date of receipt of the contract or notice of award by adding five\ndays for delivery of the award through the ordinary mails. If, as so computed, the offered delivery date is\nlater than the required delivery date, the offer will be considered nonresponsive and rejected.\n\n(End of Clause)\n\nF.3\t\n\nDELIVERY INSTRUCTIONS (12 .203) (JUL 1986)\n\nInstructions to Vendors:\nDeliver to: NASA Headquarters\nFederal Building 6, Rm 5123\n400 Maryland Avenue, S.W.\nWashington, D.C. 20546\n\n(End of Text)\n\n\t\n\nPage 10\nW-10-43764/HWC\t\n\nATTACHMENT NO. 2\n\nPRICING DOCUMENT\n\nThe Bidder shall complete the following Pricing Document in accordance with Section L.8 of this\nsolicitation /contract.\n\nItem No.\t\n\nDescription /Attaching\nDevice Type\n\nUnit\nPrice\n\nQuantity\n\n\t\n\n1.\n\n5 Year\nButton\n\na.
