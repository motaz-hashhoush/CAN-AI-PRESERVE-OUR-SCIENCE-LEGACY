Young*\n\nABSTRACT\nThe first quarter of the next century will see an operational Space\nStation that will provide a permanently manned base for satellite servicing,\nmultiple strategic scientific and commercial payload deployment, and Orbital\nManeuvering Vehicle/Orbital\nTransfer Vehicle (OMV/OTV) retrieval replenishment and deployment.\nThe Space Station, as conceived at the time of writing,\nis constructed\nin orbit and will be maintained in orbit.\nThe above construction,\nservicing, maintenance\nand deployment tasks,\nwhen coupled with the size of the Station, dictate that some form of transportation and manipulation\ndevice will be required.\nThe Transporter described in this paper will work in conjunction with\nthe Orbiter and an Assembly Work Platform (AWP) to construct the Work Station.\nThe Transporter\nwill, later in its life, work in conjunction with the Mobile\nRemote Servicer to service and install payloads, retrieve, service and deploy\nsatellites, and service and maintain the Station itself.\nFigure 1 shows the\nTransporter\ninvolved in Station construction when mounted on the AWP and\nlater supporting a maintenance\nor inspection task with the Mobile Remote\nServicer and the Flight Telerobotic Servicer.\nINTRODUCTION\nThe Mobile Transporter\nis the device that will carry the Station\nmanipulators,\ntools, payloads and orbit replaceable units around the\nStation.\nIt has to be able to move around on a truss structure fabricated\nfrom cubic bays.\nIt has to provide a firm base structure for the Space\nStation remote manipulators\nto operate from.\nIt has to move in a variable\nrate controllable manner to avoid destabilizing\nthe Space Station when carrying large payloads.\nThe Mobile Transporter must be able to reach any point on the external\ntruss structure by virtue of its own mobility mechanisms;\nconsequently,\nit\nmust be able to move in a straight line, turn right angle corners and make\n90-degree external plane changes.\nThe Mobile Transporter also has to be stowable within the Orbiter bay\nfor launch and be deployed or erected to the same size as the Space Station\ntruss for use.\n\n*Astro

structures, a\nnumber of drives, an electronics\ncontrol unit, and thermal protection and\nharnessing.\nMobile Transporter operations are controlled in detail by the\ndrive electronics\nunit.\nIt receives high-level commands either from the\nOrbiter (when the Transporter\nis building truss) or from the Mobile Remote\nServicer (MRS).\nThe drive electronics unit consists of a multiplexing\nunit,\na data processor, and a mechanism drive electronics\nunit.\nThe data processor contains the detail algorithms that control the operation of the heaters\nand drive mechanisms.\nThe multiplexer\nis an interface unit to the drive\nelectronics which monitors and powers instrumentation.\nThe mechanism\'s\ndrive electronics\nunit generates DC power for the drive motors and heaters,\nand AC power for the drive module resolvers.\nThe Mobile Transporter\nhas three degrees of freedom:\ntranslation,\nin-plane rotation, and a normal-to-plane\nrotation.\nThere are three major\nstructures in the Mobile Transporter:\nthe upper base, the track base, and\nthe lower base.\nThe general\n\narrangement,\n\nin exploded\n\nform,\n\nis depicted\n\nin Figure\n\n2.\n\nThe upper base is a self-deploying\ntruss structure fabricated from a\ncombination of two-inch-diameter\nand four-inch-square\ngraphite tube.\nThe\nupper base structure carries the MRS in its center position and it transfers\nthe forces and torques generated by the MRS during payload manipulation\ninto\nthe Space Station truss.\nThe upper base also attaches the Transporter\nto\nthe AWP and transfers any Orbiter-induced\nperturbation\nloads into the truss\nsegment that is being built.\nThe upper base has four node pin latches at its extremities.\nThese are\nthe latches that grip pins on the Space Station truss nodes, thus ensuring\nthat the upper base is firmly attached to the Station truss when it has to\nbe.\nThe upper base is attached by means of a ring in the center of its\nlower face to a turntable assembly.\nThe turntable provides the in-plane\nrotational degree of freedom that the Mobile Transporter needs in order to\nbe able to turn corners.\nThe turntable assembly itself is attached to the second major structural item, the track base assembly.\nThe track base is an EVA* unfoldable\ngraphite beam structure fabricated from square section tube, and as the name\nsuggests, it is the linear track on which the translational\ndegree of freedom drive runs.\nAttached to the underside of one of the track base\nlongerons, which is 6.219 meters long, is a gear rack and track assembly.\nThere are flat steel tape tracks attached to the top face of the "rack"\nlongeron and to the top and bottom faces of the other longeron.\n\n*Extravehicular\n\n272\n\nactivity\n\nThe track base assembly can run back and forth by 5.21 meters through\nthe drive hinge assembly.\nThe drive hinge assembly, which contains the\nnormal-to-plane\nrotational and in-plane translational degrees of freedom, is\nattached to the lower base assembly.\nConsequently,\nthe upper base can move\n5 meters back and forth with respect to the lower base.\nThus, the Mobile\nTransporter can move 5 meters one step at a time.\nSince the drive hinge\nassembly has the normal-to-plane\nrotational degree of freedom built into it,\nthe upper base can be tilted up by 90 degrees, thus allowing the Mobile\nTransporter\nto change plane from one truss face to another.\nThe lower base assembly is an EVA unfoldable planar structure fabricated from graphite square section tubes.\nThe lower base also has four node\npin latches, similar to the ones on the upper base, which serve the same\npurpose as the upper base.\nThe lower base assembly forms the attachment\nbetween the Mobile Transporter and the Space Station, while the upper base,\nMRS, payload combination\nis being translated or rotated.\nSequential or combined use of the Mobile Transporter degrees of freedom, when properly\nlatched to the Space Station truss by the relevant piece of Transporter\nstructure, thus ensures secure progress around any part of the Space Station\ntruss exterior.\nA one-bay translation\nmotions and rates."\n\nsequence\n\nis shown\n\nin Figure\n\n3, "Translation\n\nPhotograph I shows both the upper and lower bases, one on top of the\nother and both fully locked to four node pins on the structure.\nThis is the\nmode the Transporter\nwould be in for any static operations of the Mobile\nRemote Servicer, which is normally attached to the upper base.\nPhotograph 2 shows that the upper base node pin locks have released the\nstation truss node pins, fully retracted so as to allow movement, and that\nthe upper base is moving.\nTranslation motion is effected and controlled by\nthe drive hinge and track base.\nWhen the upper base moves, the track base\nmoves and the drive hinge is stationary; thus, the drive hinge rolls down a\nfixed track.\nThe translation drive mechanism is described in greater detail\nelsewhere in the paper.\nPhotograph 3 shows that the upper base has arrived at the next bay,\nwhich is not quite the fullest extent of its possible travel, with the node\npin latches closed onto the node pins.\nThe Transporter\nis now attached to\ntwo bays at eight points.\nPhotograph 4 shows that the lower base has released itself from the\nstation truss node pins, the latches have fully retracted to a11ow movement\nof the base, and the lower base is advancing.\nPhotograph 5 shows the lower base has fully advanced to the same bay\nthat the upper base is attached to and has locked itself to the structure.\nThe Transporter\nhas now moved one complete bay.\nThe time taken to perform\nthis sequence is dependent upon payload mass.\nPredicted average rates for\nvarious size payloads are shown in Figure 3.\nA direction change is shown in Figure 4, "Rotation motions."\nThe\nTransporter would perform a direction change at a junction between a transverse boom and keel, or immediately prior to making a plane change.\n\n273\n\nPhotograph i shows the Transporter as it was in Photograph 5 of Figure 3. Both bases are locked onto the same bay and the track base is\naligned with the truss.\nPhotograph 2 shows that the lower base node pin latches have been\nopened and fully retracted, and the lower base is being rotated by the\nturntable.\nThe turntable connects the upper base to the track base.\nThis\nmechanism is fully described later in the paper.\nPhotograph 3 shows the lower base drive hinge and track base fully\nrotated through 90 degrees and relatched onto the node pins.\nThe track base\nis now realigned with a new direction of travel, and translation\ncould proceed at this point.\nHowever, Photographs 4 and 5 show the sequence being\ncompleted by a rotation of the upper base performed similarly to the lower\nbase rotation shown in Photographs\n1, 2 and 3.\nA plane change is shown in sequence in Figure 5, "Plane change motions."\nPlane changing amounts to stepping out over the side of the truss,\nrotating about an axis parallel to the truss longerons into a plane parallel\nto the new plane, and grasping the new plane bay node pins with one of the\nbases.\nThat motion is followed by the other base to complete the sequence.\nPhotograph 1 shows the two bases locked onto a side face of the truss.\nA direction change has just been completed and the track base is aligned at\n90 degrees to the truss in the correct direction for a plane change.\nPhotograph 2 shows the upper base released itself from the node pins\nand advancing vertically upwards.\nPhotograph 3 shows the upper base tilting over toward the new plane.\nIt can be seen that the upper base has translated to an approximate midpoint\nof the travel prior to the tilting motion.\nThis is done so as to minimize\ntilting inertia and torque on the Space Station.\nThe mechanism that controis the plane change is the rollover drive portion of the drive hinge\nassembly.\nIt is described in detail later in the paper.\nPhotograph 4 shows the upper base fully tilted over through 90 degrees\nand rolling across the upper face on the track base toward the node pins.\nPhotograph 5 shows the two bases now firmly latched to the truss on two\nfaces at eight node pins.\nPhotograph B shows the lower base has been released from the node pins,\nand the rollover drive is now pulling it up toward the new plane.\nPhotograph 7 shows the lower base fully rotated through 90 degrees and\nready to be rolled in by the translation drive.\nPhotograph 8 shows the lower base rolled in underneath the upper base\ntoward the node pins where it is latched 90 degrees away from where it\nstarted.\nMECHANISMS\n\nINSTRUMENTATION\n\nAND LUBRICATION\n\nKey requirements that have driven the concept design of the Transporter\ngenerally, and the mechanisms particularly,\nare the need for 30 years lifetime with maintenance and full single failure tolerance without any loss of\nperformance.\nThe first requirement will drive the lubrication\nsystem design\n\n274\n\nand cause the mechanisms to be configured\nsecond requirement\ncauses the mechanisms\nically\nand electronically.\n\nas orbit\nreplaceable\nto be fully\nredundant,\n\nunits.\nboth\n\nThe\nmechan-\n\nThe Tranporter mechanisms are the node pin latches, a turntable and the\ndrive hinge assembly.\nA11 the mechanisms use a common motor resolver and\nbrake module even though the mechanisms are somewhat different.\nThe node\npin latches are shown in Figure 6. The node pin latches are grippers, they\nhave a pair of jaws attached by pivots to the front of the latch body.\nThe\njaws are opened or closed in the following manner.\nThe motor module contained within the latch body causes a threaded shaft, which protrudes from\nthe rear of the latch body, to rotate.\nThere is a gimbal mounted nut running on the threaded shaft and the nut is part of a "U" bracket which\n"wraps" around the latch body toward the front of the latch.\nWhen the\nthreaded shaft is rotated, the "U" bracket moves back or forth.\nThe front\nof the "U" bracket is connected to the latch jaws bY a pair of pivoted\npush/pull\n\nrods.\n\nConsequently,\nas the motor rotor turns, the threaded shaft rotates, the\n"U" bracket is moved forward, the push rods are moved forward, and the latch\njaws close onto the node pin.\n\nstill\n\nThe motor\nfunction\n\nresolver and brake are all dual wound\nif only three out of the four latches\n\nand the Transporter\nare functional.\n\ncan\n\nEach latch is mounted on a spring compliance system that a11ows motion\nin a radial direction only.\nThus, the pattern of four latches can "breathe"\nto allow differential\nexpansion between the Transporter and the truss.\nThe turntable assembly is shown in Figure 7. It is electrically quadruple redundant and mechanically\ndual redundant.\nIt has two crossed roller\nwire race bearings, two drive modules, an upper housing, a lower housing,\nand a "floating" internal ring gear.\nThe bearings are 40 inches in diameter.\nFigure 7 shows the turntable sectioned, the wire race crossed\nroller bearing concept, and the predicted force-speed characteristic.\nThe bearings and drive are fully redundant and operate in the following\nmanner.\nWhen the prime drive is running, the redundant drive is locked by\nits integral power-off brake.\nBecause the redundant drive cannot rotate,\nthe internal ring gear is rotationally grounded to the lower housing, so in\nconsequence, the upper housing rotates on the upper wire race bearing and\nthe prime drive pinion rolls around the internal ring gear.\nWhen the redundant drive is running, the prime drive is locked, consequently,\nthe ring\ngear is rotationally grounded to the upper housing.\nThus, the lower bearing\nrotates in the lower housing and the redundant drive pinion drives the ring\ngear and upper housing around.\n\ntrack\n\nThe turntable\nbase.\n\nis configured\n\nto be removable\n\nfrom below\n\nthrough\n\nthe\n\n275\n\nThe drive hinge assembly contains two separate drives; the rollover\ndrive for plane changing and the translation drive for moving in a straight\nline.\nFigure 8 shows a side view of the rollover drive.\nIt is a double-ended\nscrew jack with a common,high precision, threaded, tubular shaft having\ntwo motor-driven planetary roller nuts running on it.\nOne of the motordriven nuts is gimbal mounted to the Transporter lower base structure, the\nother motor-driven nut is similarly attached to the drive hinge structure.\nThe threaded shaft is prevented from rotating so that when either of the\nroller nuts is rotated, the threaded shaft is passed through that roller\nnut. The linear motion of the jack shaft is converted into rotary motion of\nthe drive hinge by having the rollover hinge pivot offset from the jack\nshaft line of action.\nDual redundancy is achieved because either motored nut can rotate the\ndrive hinge. The threaded jack shaft exterior is protected, over its ends,\nby tubular shields attached to the drive module housings and by an expandable metal bellows between the drive module housings. The two characteristics shown in Figure 8 relate jack output force to jack extension rate and\noutput torque at the hinge pivot to the angle of rotation of the hinge.\nThe shape of the second characteristic\nis so because the distance from the\njack line of action to the hinge pivot changes as the hinge rotates.\nFigure 9 is a composite view of the various translation drive components and the translation drive characteristic.\nThe translation drive is a\nrack and pinion drive, the rack is attached to the underside of the track\nbase along its full length. The rack has two rows of teeth, one prime and\none redundant, with a full tooth depth separation groove between them. The\nbearing roller strips can be seen in Figure 9 attached to the track base.\nThe rolling strips on the left hand longeron, as shown, only provide normal\nto plane location.\nThe rolling strips on the right-hand longeron provide\nin-plane as well as normal-to-plane location by virtue of the vee roller\narrangement and the two inclined strips on the underside. The rollers that\nbear on the rolling strips are mounted "fore" and "aft" on the drive hinge\nstructure on a 40-inch stance to provide pitch stability\nfor the track base.\nThe rollers that run on the upper bearing\ncompliantly mounted to allow for manufacturing\nexpansion.\n\nstrips, as shown, are\ntolerances and differential\n\nThe translation drive has two separate drive modules attached to the\ndrive hinge structure by rocking brackets mounted on a common pivot.\nDrive\ntorque from the drive module is transmitted through a drive spindle and\npinion to the drive rack.\nThe drive pinion is held in mesh with the rack by\na changeover actuator which pulls or pushes the relevant rocking drive mount\nover to its driving position.\nWhen the prime drive is engaged, the redundant drive is completely disengaged.\nIf the prime drive experiences a complete mechanical\nfailure, then the changeover actuator rotates the redundant\n\n276\n\ndrive into loose mesh with the rack on the redundant tooth row, then rotates\nthe prime drive completely out of mesh and then finally correctly meshes the\nredundant drive with the rack.\nThis is accomplished by the changeover actuator interacting with cam profiles in the rocking drive mounts.\nDuring its 30-year lifetime, the Mobile Transporter will experience\n160,000 temperature cycles associated with orbital eclipses.\nLubrication\nsystems that would be used on geosynchronous\nsatellite mechanisms have to\nwithstand 3,700 temperature cycles for a 10-year lifetime.\nA low earth\norbit spacecraft mechanism may have 11,000 cycles due to orbital eclipses.\nThe Mobile Transporter\nis clearly in a different regime with regard to\nlubricant lifetime.\nMaintainability\nanalysis, using such data that may be\navailable within NASA from orbiter missions, will predict lubrication life\nand as a consequence, mean time between maintenance\nactions.\n\nformed\n\nThe above predictions\nduring\nthe design,\n\nwill\nbe verified\ndevelopment,\ntest,\n\nby development\nand evaluation\n\ntesting\nphase\n\nto be perof the contract.\n\nThe Mobile Transporter\nlubrication concept is based on the use of\nBraycote grease.\nFor the most part, the mechanisms are fully housed and\nsealed, the translation\nrack, however, is exposed.\nThe volatility of the\ngrease, albeit very low, may be such that some form of reservoir or replenishment method may be required. The reservoir may take the form of a\nsintered\nplastic pinion gear inpregnated with grease or oii that is\nattached to the drive hinge and permanently\nruns on the rack.\nTo aid deposition of the lubricant on the rack, the pinion could be heated to create\nthermal siphoning.\nThe Transporter\ninstrumentation\nconsists of resolvers in each drive\nmodule, an absolute encoder on the drive hinge axis for measuring rollover\nangle and geared encoders on the turntable and translation drive.\nThe translation geared encoder is a multi-turn encoder with a resolution of eight bits corresponding\nto 0.05 inches of linear displacement.\nThe\nabsolute position is determined by viewing four linear encoder tracks etched\nonto the the track base with redundant reading heads.\nThe Mobile Transporter also has to detect which bay it is on at any\ntime.\nVarious methods of encoding truss locations and reading the codes\nwill be studied.\nThe possible coding methods may be optical, magnetic,\ncapacitive or inductive.\n\n277\n\nFigure 1.
