These\nexperts can share the benefits and utilization of resources from the International Space\nStation (ISS) while sharing and \xe2\x80\x9ctranslating\xe2\x80\x9d exciting science being conducted by\nprofessional scientists. Active engagement with these STEM experts involves students\nin the journey of science and exploration in an enthralling and understandable manner.\nThis active engagement, connecting classrooms with scientific experts, helps inspire\nand build the next generation of scientific explorers in academia, private industry, and\ngovernment.\nThe Expedition Earth and Beyond (EEAB) Program is an Earth and planetary science\neducation program designed to inspire, engage, and educate teachers and students.\nEEAB provides resources, activities, and opportunities that allow classrooms to get\nactively involved with NASA exploration, discovery, and the process of science. The\nprogram, facilitated by the Astromaterials Research and Exploration Science (ARES)\nDivision at the NASA Johnson Space Center, primarily utilizes the Crew Earth\nObservations (CEO) payload and imagery as a hook to motivate student learning. The\nGateway to Astronaut Photography of Earth website (http://eol.jsc.nasa.gov) houses\nmillions of CEO images taken by astronauts using digital hand-held cameras from the\nInternational Space Station (ISS). This site receives millions of hits per month, indicating\nthe excitement generated by the public in viewing these images. EEAB uses astronaut\nphotographs provided by the CEO payload as the premise of developed activities,\nresources, and program components promoting student-led research in grades 5-12.\nOver the last few years, EEAB has also provided virtual access to STEM experts and\nISS resources through classroom connection webinars. These webinar connections,\ngrowing in interest and participation each year, have become increasingly effective in\nbeing able to reach out and involve classrooms across the nation with STEM experts\nand the use of ISS resources.\nClassroom connection webinars are online distance learning events designed to\nconnect distributed participants (students and teachers) and allow them to be actively\nengaged as they interact with STEM experts. Events are facilitated through the use of\nWebEx, a web-based collaborative tool. Technical requirements are minimal -- an\ninternet-connected computer and a speaker phone. Participants have utilized SKYPE or\nGoogle Voice as speaker phone alternatives. Expedition Earth and Beyond classroom\nconnection webinars generally focus on a broad range of topics such as Earth\nobservations, remote sensing, comparative planetology, and/or planetary exploration.\nThe interactive nature of the webinars enables event facilitators to ask students\nquestions to gain insight into their prior knowledge, to gauge their understanding, and to\n\nhelp keep students engaged throughout the event. At the end of each ~45 minute\ninteraction there is time allotted for students to ask questions. For those interested, an\noptional extended question and answer session is provided. As these webinars are\navailable to classrooms across different time zones, sessions are offered on two\ndifferent days and at different times in order to accommodate the interest and\navailability of participants. For those who may be unable to participate in a live event,\nevent archives are available.\nThese virtual connections help enhance participants\xe2\x80\x99 understanding of the value of work\nbeing done from the unique platform of the ISS. They also provide an opportunity for\nstudents to engage and interact with ISS scientists and STEM role models. Additionally,\nthese events are designed to help teachers address concepts and content standards\nthey are required to teach. Teachers learn how to integrate data and imagery obtained\nthrough the ISS to help promote scientific thinking, help students observe and conduct\ninvestigations focusing on our changing planet, and help students consider how these\ndata can be used to better understand or investigate other planetary worlds such as\nMars. Webinars that focus on Earth/Mars comparisons allow students to see the value\nin data obtained from the ISS and how that can be useful as a basis of understanding\nMars. This is especially useful as NASA embarks on the journey to Mars and beyond.\nSince 2009, Expedition Earth and Beyond classroom connection webinars have\nreached over 15,000 participants in 40 states. Post-surveys about the events have\nindicated an overwhelmingly positive response to the webinars. Survey comments\ninclude: \xe2\x80\x9cWe thoroughly enjoyed this experience. The opportunity to engage with a real\nscientist working in such a thrilling capacity is immeasurable.\xe2\x80\x9d; \xe2\x80\x9cWhat made this\npresentation particularly effective was the interactive nature of it. The moderator did an\nexcellent job of making the students feel connected with the scientist and thereby with\nthe science.\xe2\x80\x9d; \xe2\x80\x9cThe students loved the fact that their questions were being answered\nand shared with other schools.\xe2\x80\x9d; \xe2\x80\x9cThese experiences motivate our students, promote\ntheir curiosity, and help them understand the bigger picture of science.\xe2\x80\x9d Overall\nfeedback from participants has indicated that these events are exciting, inspiring,\nmotivating, and extremely valuable experiences. Students and teachers continue to ask\nfor more webinars.\nEngaging students and teachers with STEM experts highlights the ISS and its unique\ndatasets (such as astronaut photography) to inspire, engage, and educate students and\nteachers. Webinar events enable the excitement and story of science and exploration to\ncome to life in classrooms across the nation. These virtual events capture participants\xe2\x80\x99\nattention while increasing their science awareness, providing them access to STEM\nexperts, and reinforcing Next Generation Science Standard concepts. Classrooms no\nlonger have to simply read about science in a textbook or from the internet; webinars\nenable classrooms to interact with, engage in, and become part of the journey of\nscience and exploration as they prepare to become the next generation of scientific\nexplorers and science professionals.\n\n'
