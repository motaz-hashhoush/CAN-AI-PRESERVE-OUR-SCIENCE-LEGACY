This\nstudy led to the design of concepts (ref. 1 ) which could convert coherent laser radiation into flow\nenergy with a theoretical efficiency of unity. However, in examining the practical efficiencies that\ncould be achieved, it was also found that the fraction of energy that was converted on each pass of\nthe fluid was very small compared to the flow energy. Hence, only by extremely efficient design\ncould successful photon engines of this class be created.\nHowever, the coherent energy field of a laser can be concentrated into a small volume so that\nhigh energy densities and high gas temperatures are easily achieved. A normal thermodynamic\nengine working over this temperature range also produced efficiencies close to one. Nonetheless,\nthis heat energy cannot be converted into work with a very high efficiency due to the well known\nlimitations of high temperature materials.\nA class of heat engines developed some years ago has proved capable of operation above\nnormal material temperatures. Essentially, these heat engines use a device called the Energy\nExchanger (ref. 2) which is related to principles developed by Claude Seippel of Brown Bovari (ref.\n3). This principle has shown that energy can be directly exchanged between high temperature and\nlow temperature gases so that the wall temperature of the machine sees only an average. An\nextension of this principle has shown that this energy exchange can in principle be also made highly\nefficient if an acoustic velocity match between the hot and cold gas is maintained. This ratio is\neasily maintained in working machinery by use of high molecular weight gases in contact with low\nmolecular weight gases. Indeed, temperature ratios as high as 10 can be achieved. With these high\ntemperatures the circulating power fraction becomes very small since the work available per unit of\nmass flow is correspondingly large. .Indeed, in the limit of very high temperatures, it can be shown\nthat for a simple cycle such as the Brayton cycle, the component inefficiency can be tolerated as\nshown in figure 1 . When combined with recent studies showing that lasers can be used to heat gases\nto extremely high temperatures, such as has been proposed at this meeting for jet propulsion and as\nproposed for wind tunnel research (ref. 4), it is evident that very high thermal efficiencies are\nachievable. A reasonable extrapolation of this technology suggests that it is within engineering\ncapabilities today to produce a practical engine that can convert coherent radiation back to work\nwith efficiencies of approximately 60 percent. It is expected that further studies will show how this\nefficiency can be increased to 75 percent.\nA proposed method of operating such a machine would involve the following operation as a\nBrayton cycle as shown in figure 2. We will consider here for simplicity only a simple regenerated\nBrayton cycle with the addition of an energy exchanger device. A compressor will be used, using a\nsuitable intercooler, to bring the gas to a reasonably high compression ratio. The working gas could\n\n167\n\nBLANK NOT\n\nI l l l I I I I I I I I f f l E I I I I\n\nbe in this example argon or water vapor. The working gas would then be passed to the equivalent of\nthe combustion chamber in a normal gas turbine cycle. However, rather than using combustion,\nheating would take place directly by laser energy addition. The laser heating techniques would\nclosely follow those proposed by NASA in its program for space propulsion.\nRoughly speaking the same problems of laser energy coupling and heating will be involved.\nAfter heating, however, the temperatures required in such a cycle would not be as high as that\nnecessary for propulsion. The use of argon or water vapor of course would be necessary. After\nheating, the gas would be expanded into an energy exchanger device (ref. 2) as shown in figure 3\nand give up its enthalpy directly to a gas of low molecular weight. For example, steam or hydrogen\ncould prove interesting. The temperature of the driven gas would be limited to 1000\xc2\xb0K, the\nconventional turbine inlet temperature. Since the molecular weight of argon is approximately 40\nand that of hydrogen approximately 2, the temperature ratio for perfect acoustic impedance\nmatching, which is required for efficient energy exchanger operation in this case, would allow a\ntheoretical argon temperature of nearly 20,000\xc2\xb0 K. Hence the hydrogen temperature can either be\nmade correspondingly low or gases of higher molecular weight can be used. This is of course an\nexample of the extremes of operation. Steam might indeed be a very practical driver gas though the\ntemperature ratios achievable for highest efficiency are not near as high.\nThe hydrogen or steam in the driven gas loop now has nearly the entire enthalpy of the laser\nheated gas at a much lower temperature. It then enters the turbine, expands through the turbine,\nand returns through the energy exchanger for recompression. The argon or steam, after it is\ndischarged from the energy exchanger then passes through a conventional heat exchanger and is\nreturned to the cycle. Thus we have the elements of a completely closed cycle as shown in figure 4.\nWhile the energy exchanger adds an element of inefficiency, the very high enthalpies involved mean\na very small circulating power fraction which tends to reduce the effect of component inefficiencies\nand make it possible to achieve nearly ideal Brayton cycle efficiency.\nWe have yet to explore all of the problems involved in the optimal design of such a cycle. For\nexample, the temperature limits on the argon could be such that they would involve a high radiative\nheat loss thus effectively limiting the advantages of laser heating. In addition there will be mixing of\nthe driver and driven gas and hence some type of separation mechanism may have to be employed.\nThis of course would be simplified by using steam in the driver or driven loop of the cycle since it\ncould easily be condensed out as part of the operation and returned to the cycle. As pointed out\npreviously, even when working with air, thermal efficiencies approaching 50 percent were achieved\nand certainly in this configuration we could expect to easily exceed this value. As a practical\nthermal-cycle this appears very appealing at this state, since it is capable not only of high conversion\nefficiency but involves concepts built around existing thermal machinery and has a capability for\nhandling large amounts of power in principle.\n\n1?\n\n17\n\n>^\n\xe2\x80\xa2*\n\n-,\xc2\xbb_\n\n\xc2\xa3\n\nIn view of the potential of this approach, work in this area is continuing and studies of cycles\nof this type will be carried out to examine the limits of operation.\n\n168\n\n1 I I 1 I 1 I I I I I 1 I E 1 I I I I\n\nREFERENCES\n\n1.\n\nHertzberg, Abraham; Christiansen, Walter C.; Johnsont, Earl W.; and Alstrom, Harlow G.: Photon Generators\nand Engines for Laser Power Transmission.

At the high\ntemperature?\nAnswer: That is where you want to add it to keep the entropy low. But look, between infinite temperature and\n5000 degrees, there is enough AT to make heat transfer possible. Look, just imagine the rocket nozzle sitting in\nspace and these tubes rotating by it. So we then use this as an energy exchanger, or really an enthalpy exchanger.\nThe trick in getting it to be efficient is, if I can run this in two closed cycles, I can use gases of vastly different\nmolecular weight which are commonly available and which are very compatible with real machinery. Argon is inert,\nhelium is inert, the quantities needed are not large, and, finally, they are recyclable.\nArthur Cohn, Electric Power Research Institute - What is the efficiency of the gas-dynamic compressor like?\nAnswer: Well, in a widely unread paper (good thing you asked that question, sir!) we examined that. The machine is\nnot for "smallies" - leakage and viscous losses will kill you. What we did is optimize it for several different cycles.\nThe paper is "The Energy Exchanger \xe2\x80\x94 A New Concept for High Efficiency Gas Turbines" written in about 1966.\nIncidently, we found you could not sell, in those days, high efficiency gas turbines since people said, look at the cost\nof fuel compared with the capital cost! So it was unsaleable. But things have changed a little and that is why we are\ngoing back to look at it. We assumed just steam and air, not perfectly impedance matched, and found the efficiency\nof the exchanger to be 15 percent. So you add that loss; you optimize your cycle, adding a little turbine reheat, etc.,\nand you find the cycle efficiency to be over 60 percent. So remember, if I apply it with perfect impedance matching,\nI would estimate, even at higher temperatures, I could keep the same 15 percent loss. But remember that those losses\nbegin to disappear because the enthalpy per pound of gas going through there is so high that the inefficiencies\nworking on it have less chance of being deadly. High temperatures are the salvation of almost any thermal machine.\nIt even makes something like MHD which has a conversion of approximately 30 percent mechanical to electrical\nlook more attractive (if things don\'t melt). So we continue to examine this. We wish it would work with coal but it\'s\nhard to believe that ah1 that rotating machinery will live in such a dusty environment.\nKen Billman, NASA Ames Research Center - Abe, what was the exact reference of the paper?\nAnswer: It was presented at the Gas Turbine Conference at Zurich, Switzerland of 1966; American Society of\nMechanical Engineers, Paper No. 66-GT-l 17. It is an archival reference.\nGerald Dzakowic, Lawrence Livermore Laboratory \xe2\x80\x94 How high a temperature difference can the Comprex machine\ntolerate across the unit? Will you eventually become radiation limited?\nAnswer: Yes, I\'ll become radiation limited at about 5000\xc2\xb0K. Remember, when we expand the gas into the\nComprex its ambient temperature, in the Comprex, is quite a bit lower. However, the time that the gas is at\nstagnation at 5000\xc2\xb0K is very small and the radiation transfer will be significant at that temperature. We haven\'t done\nall the numbers yet, however. But a good point to mention is that at some temperature we are forbidden to use high\nmolecular weight gases since they are great radiators.\nGary Russell, J. P. L. - Abe, as I remember, you applied that concept at Cornell to heat wind tunnels. Was the\nmotivation the same or was it just an inexpensive approach to that problem?\nAnswer: Well, there was no other way to get air at 5000\xc2\xb0K, 1500 psi total pressure. And, by the way, there still isn\'t\n- we\'ve done better in an arc but not at those pressures. Nobody has been able to hit stagnation temperatures like\nthat. In fact, we never found anything that would stand up to that blast coming out. Nothing!\n\n171\n\n'
