Significant progress towards that goal was made in 2021, including on the agency\u2019s Space Launch System (SLS) rocket \u2013 a key part of the Artemis initiative. The SLS core stage for the Artemis I mission \u2013 the first launch of SLS and an uncrewed Orion capsule \u2013 completed its Green Run test series in early 2021 and was successfully mated with the SLS twin solid rocket boosters on the mobile launcher at Kennedy Space Center (KSC). The launch vehicle stage adapter, interim cryogenic propulsion stage, and the Orion stage adapter structural test  article and Orion spacecraft  mass  simulator  were  also  stacked.  The  flight  Orion spacecraft and Orion stage adapter are being prepared for stacking and launch, targeted for late 2021 following a wet dress rehearsal at Launch Complex 39B. SLS hardware for Artemis II, which will be the first flight of crew on Orion and SLS, is also in work. Work progressed on core stage components, booster segments, and other hardware for Artemis III and future missions. This paper will detail the progress made.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "cui": {}, "meetings": [{"country": "US", "submissionId": 20210022125, "endDate": "2021-11-17T06:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"organizationId": "71fb4af96d4a59b5a0a2084db7b4ce35", "meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics", "location": "Reston, Virginia, United States"}}, "meetingId": "1f807a128a9d4c309f1c850ea1a6e393", "id": "8f8029bd615542e1b5eff8aa4b954482"}], "name": "AIAA ASCEND", "location": "Virtual", "id": "1f807a128a9d4c309f1c850ea1a6e393", "url": "https://www.ascend.events/", "startDate": "2021-11-15T06:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "name": "DRAFT - ASCEND 2021 SLS Update - 21 Sept 21.docx", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20210022125/downloads/DRAFT%20-%20ASCEND%202021%20SLS%20Update%20-%2021%20Sept%2021.docx", "pdf": "/api/citations/20210022125/downloads/DRAFT%20-%20ASCEND%202021%20SLS%20Update%20-%2021%20Sept%2021.docx.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20210022125/downloads/DRAFT%20-%20ASCEND%202021%20SLS%20Update%20-%2021%20Sept%2021.docx.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
