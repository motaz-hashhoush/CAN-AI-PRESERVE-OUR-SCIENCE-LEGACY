Akron Rd., Moffett\nField, CA 94035\nIntroduction: On 23 October a partial solar\neclipse occurred across parts of the southwest United\nStates between approximately 21:09 and 23:40 (UT),\nwith maximum obscuration, 36%, occurring at 22:29\n(UT). During 21-26 October 2014 the Mojave Volatile Prospector (MVP) field expedition deployed and\noperated the NASA Ames Krex2 rover in the Mojave\ndesert west of Baker, California (Fig. 1, bottom). The\nMVP field expedition primary goal was to characterize\nthe surface and sub-surface soil moisture properties\nwithin desert alluvial fans, and as a secondary goal to\nprovide mission operations simulations of the Resource Prospector (RP) mission to a Lunar pole. The\npartial solar eclipse provided an opportunity during\nMVP operations to address serendipitous science.\nScience instruments on Krex2 included a neutron\nspectrometer, a near-infrared spectrometer with associated imaging camera, and an independent camera\ncoupled with software to characterize the surface textures of the areas encountered. All of these devices are\nfocused upon the surface and as a result are downward\nlooking. In addition to these science instruments, two\nhazard cameras are mounted on Krex2.\nThe chief device used to monitor the partial solar\neclipse was the engineering development unit of the\nNear-Infrared\nVolatile\nSpectrometer\nSystem\n(NIRVSS) near-infrared spectrometer. This device\nuses two separate fiber optic fed Hadamard transform\nspectrometers. The short-wave and long-wave spectrometers measure the 1600-2400 and 2300-3400 nm\nwavelength regions with resolutions of 10 and 13 nm,\nrespectively. Data are obtained approximately every 8\nseconds. The NIRVSS stares in the opposite direction\nas the front Krex2.\nField Observations: The primary objective of\nMVP on 23 October was to characterize a specific\nalluvial fan, and to confirm repeatability of spectral\nobservations. A back-and-forth raster scan was designed and implemented along an approximately eastwest direction from the proximal to distal portion of\nthe fan (R1, Fig. 1, top). At the end of this initial scan\na reverse scan, from the distal to proximal portion of\nthe fan was performed, but with a distal offset (R2,\nFig. 1, top). Initial eclipse observations oriented the\nrover facing away from the sun to allow NIRVSS to\nmore directly view the reflected sunlilght. Unfortunately, positioning the rover carefully was quickly\ndeemed too time consuming to achieve the primary\n\nscience objective. To place the texture definitions into\ncontext, the team focusing on the camera for texture\ndefinition requested observations where Krex2 rotated\n360\xef\x82\xb0 obtaining a image every 60\xef\x82\xb0. In lieu of dedicated\neclipse observations, NIRVSS operated continuously\nduring these spins.\n\nFigure 1.

Beginning, and maximum of the eclipse are indicated\nalong the top axis.\nAnalyses: We initially restrict the analyses to observations at >170\xef\x82\xb0 solar phase angle (Fig. 2, bottom).\nAs a proxy for brightness we use the short-wavelength\nradiance. This value is defined as the mean radiance\nvalue measured by the short-wavelength spectrometer\nand are shown as the open circles in Fig. 3. As the\nsolar altitude decreases (Fig. 2, red lines), potentially\nmore sunlight comes under Krex2. We applied a correction for incidence angle and scaled the data to the\ninitial measurement in each day; rc = rin / [cos(i) /\ncos(in)], where rc and rin are the calculated and initial\nmeasured radiance, i (90\xef\x82\xb0-solar altitude) is incidence\nangle for a given observation, an in is the incidence\nangle for the initial measurement. The results are\nshown as the lines in Fig. 3. With the exception of the\n10/22 points, the trends seen in the data points are\ngenerally described by this correction. However, scatter remains for the observations and we speculate this\nmay be due to surface reflectance differences, atmospheric influence on the mean radiance calculation,\nand/or variable clouds.

However, it is not currently\npossible to conclude that this is due solely to the\neclipse event, especially since the radiance increases\nnoticeably immediately after the maximum obscuration. If atmospheric influences are the cause of the\nincrease in radiance, then this will not be an issue on\nthe lunar surface. However, the influence of surface\nreflectance and textural differences remain to be fully\ncharacterized.\nIn an ideal situation to acquire the serendipitous\nscience associated with the partial solar eclipse, Krex2\nwould have remained in the same location and only\nrotated to track the changing solar azimuth angle.\nHowever, during a lunar mission such a dramatic departure from the primary science goals may not be\nscientifically acceptable.\n\n'
