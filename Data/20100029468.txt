The process employs an electrolytic cell in which the object or objects\nto be textured are immersed in a sodium\nchloride and water solution in a metal\ncontainer. The objects to be textured\n(anode) are electrically connected to the\npositive terminal of a DC power source\nand the metal container (cathode) is similarly connected to the negative terminal of\nthe power source. During the electrochemical process the electrolyte is agitated\nby an ultrasonic transducer.\n\nTwo-Phase Quality/Flow Meter\n(u.s.\n\nPatent No. 5,861.755)\n\nInventors: J. Steven Moerk, Robert C.\nYoungquist, and Rudy J. Werl ink,\nKennedy Space Center\n\nThe present invention deals with a twophase quality/flow meter that can measure the ratio (or "quality") of liquid to\ngas in, and the flow velocity of, a twophase flow stream by using capacitance\nmeasurements. It seeks to overcome the\ndrawbacks of currently employed capacitance-based meters by providing a device\nthat eliminates the need for a high-frequency oscillator circuit to measure\ncapacitance changes. Thi type of device\'s\noscillator is typically very sensitive to electrical noise-induced errors. Furthermore,\ntemperature and pressure changes affect\nthe device\'s capacitance and are thus a\nsource of error. Instead of the 0 cillator,\nthis invention uses circuitry that accurate-\n\nly measures the time required to charge a\nprobe capacitor to a thre hold voltage.\nTimer and counter circuits are employed\nto measure the elap ed time between the\nstart of charging and the attainment of\nthe thre hold value, re ulting in a digital\nvalue that is fed directly into a microproce or and .is linearly proportional to\nthe capacitance value. Another advantage\ni that the device generate a high-re olution digital value based upon analog measurements without use of an expensive\nhigh-resolution A-to-D converter. In addition, this arrangement is extremely noisetolerant, since it does not rely upon frequency changes to convert a capacitance\nmeasurement to a digital value.\n\nFerroelectric Stirling-Cycle\nRefrigerator\n(u.s. Patent No. 5,867,991)\nInventors: Anthony Jalink, Jr.,\nRichard F. Hellbaum, and Wayne W.\nRohrbach, Langley Research Center\n\nStirling-cyde cryogenic refrigerators\nhave problems, among them the deleterious effects of dead space, lack of controllability of flow rate, contamination of the\nworking fluid, and vibration that is communicated to the delicate components being\nrefrigerated. The invention addresses these\nfactors, providing a cryogenic device that is\nsuitable for cooling sensitive infrared detectors to very low temperatures. It has a threepump configuration and pumping\nsequence, in which one pump serves as a\ncompressor, one as an expander, and one\nas a displacer. The pumps are ferroelectrically actuated diaphragm pumps that are\ncoordinated by synchronizing the ferroelectric-actuator voltages in such a way that\nthe net effect of the displacer is to reduce\ndead space - that is, to circulate a greater\nfraction of the working fluid through the\nheat exchangers than would be po ible\nusing the compressor and expander alone.\nIn addition, the displacer can be controlled\nseparately to make the fluid flow in the\nexchangers turbulent, to increase the rate\nof transfer of heat at the cost of greater\nresistance to flow, or laminar, to decrease\nthe resistance to flow at the cost of a lower\nheat-transfer rate.\n\nFor more information on the inventions described here, contact the approfrriate NASA Field\nCenter\'s Commercial Technology Office.

Unlike\nother marking technologies, there are no messy inks to replace, no\nhazardous solvents to dispose of, and no tool wear. The only problem\nhas been that, while lasers have always offered long-term cost savings, their initial price has often been too high for many companies\'\nbudgets.\nAt Synrad, we set out to design a laser\nmarking system that could be sold at a\nprice low enough to enable more compa- lAS E R loll AR K E R\nnies to switch to laser marking. Priced at\njust $15,900", our new Fenix laser marker offers all the features of\nother laser marking systems on the market - at a fraction of the price!\nFenix marks alphanumencs, graphics, and more at speeds up to 180\ncharacters per second.\n\nFEN I X\n\nThe core of this compact, self-contained system is a 25 watt Synrad\nsealed C02 laser. Designed for rugged enVironments, a Synrad laser\ncan be expected to operate for tens of thousands of hours With no\nmaintenance requirements. Fenix operates from a standard. usersupplied PC. It couldn\'t be more simple to set up - just connect it to\nthe computer, plug it into the wall, and start marking!\nSynrad\'s own Windows\xc2\xae-based software, WinMark lite, provides the\nuser-interface to Fenix. This intuitive, easy-to-use software enables\nusers to perform most marking functions. For advanced applications\nsuch as serialization, bar coding, and automation, upgrade to the feature-packed Win Mark Pro\xe2\x84\xa2, and take full advantage of this flexible\nmarking solution.\nThe first truly affordable laser solution to industrial marking, Fenix\nbrings all the benefits of a state-of-the-art laser system at a lower\ncost than you ever imagined.

While a single\nrequirement such as low friction may\nrestrict the use of rubber lip seals ,\napplications that combine several extreme\noperating conditions virtually eliminate the\nsuccessful use of elastomeric seals.\nTurcontD VariliptD rotary shaft seals, made\nfrom high-performance polymers, offer an\nalternative to rubber lip seals for these\ndifficult applications. In addition, higher\nperformance and increased efficiency are\nnow possible due to the TurcontD VariliptD.\n\nThe TurcontD Varilip\xc2\xb7 offers universal\nchemical compatibility, exhibits very low\nfriction, operates above 12,000 sfpm and\nproduces leak-tight sealing. These seals are\navailable in standard inch nominal and\nmetric sizes in addition to a vast range of\ncustom sizes and configurations.\nFor an extra measure of performance and\nreliability in difficult operating conditions,\nwithout the problems of degradation,\nembrittlement and premature wear, the\nTurcon\xc2\xb7 Varilip\xc2\xb7 is a very effective\nalternative to rubber lip seals.\nBusak+Shamban. 800-767-3257.\n\n~\n\n,\n\n~D\')\n-.\n\n-~\n~\n\n__ d\n\nFor More Infonnatlon Circle No. 5]1\n\nSEALS THAT GO TO EXTREMES\n\nThree spring-energizer\ndesigns make the Turcon\xc2\xae\nVariseal"" more versatile.\nWith a choice of three spring-energizer\ndesigns, engineer can now specify seals\noptimized for virtually any application.\nInserted in a Turcon tD engineeredpolymer jacket, these springs permanently\nenergize the Variseal\'" to maintain a\npositive seal over a long operating life.\nEach of the three designs-th.

The algorithm generates a me h for computing\nthe flow in a region bounded by olid\ncomponents that have pre cribed sizes,\nshapes, positions, and orientation, and\nthat may be moving with respect to\neach other.\nSome background information is\nprerequisite to a summary of the algorithm . Unlike ome other computational grids, Cartesian me he are not\nbody-fitted. The cells of arte ian\nmesh are hexahedral (more pecifically, right parallelepipeds) and some\ncell can extend through surfaces of\nsolid components in the computational\ndomain. Therefore, part of any Cartesian-me h-generation aJgorithm must\ninclude identification of cell that intersect solid surfaces and the flagging\nor removal of cells that are completely\ninte rnal to the solid objects and thus\nnot in the flow field. The remaining\ncells are then con idered general volume mesh elements.\nFundamentally, in Cartesian approaches, one trades the case-specific\nproblem of generating a body-fitted surface me h for the more general problem\nof computing and characterizing inter-\n\nection between hexahedral me h cell\nand body urface . Thu , all difficultie\nas ociated with meshing a given geometry are re tricted to a lower-order manifold that con titutes the wetted urface\nof the geometry.\nnlike the urface cell of a body-fitted mesh, the cells of a Carte ian\nme h that intersect the surface are describable without de cribing the urface it elf. In other words, the de cription of the surface is no longer\nneeded to re olve both the flow and\nthe local geometry. Therefore , efforts\nto de cribe the surface can be focused\nuniquely on the task of resolving the\ngeometry, while computations that involve me h cells are devoted to a description of the flow. Of course, accurate representations of boundary\nconditions in cells that intersect urfaces are e sential to uccessful Cartesian chemes. Thi conclude the\nbackground information .\nThe present algorithm implements\na two-pha e trategy: In the fir t\nphase, intersections among all components are found and u ed to complete the description of the wetted\nurface, so that all surface-inter ecting Cartesian cells found subsequently are guaranteed to be exposed\nto the flow field. The remaining\n\nme h-generation problem can then\nbe treated a if it were a ingle-component problem . In the econd pha e ,\nthe volume me h i generated.\nThe component-inter ection part of\nthe algorithm i a robu t geometry-oriented subalgorithm that, among other\nthing , accommodates the urface triangulations commonly u ed to decribe the surface of solid components. Thi\nubalgorithm utilize\nadaptive precision arithmetic, and it include a tie-braking routine that automatically and consi tentJy re olves geometric degeneracies. The worst-ca e\ncomputational complexity of the interection ubalgorithm is of the order of\nMogN, where N is the number of triangles describing the geometry.\nThe volume-mesh-generation part of\nthe algorithm take the intersected urface triangulation as input and generate the mesh through divi ion of hexahedral cell of an initially uniform\ncoarse grid. This approach preserves\nthe ability to refine the me h to different degrees in different directions, consistently with the local geometry,\nthereby making it po sible to avoid generating exce sive number of Carte ian\ncell in three dimen ion . The meshgeneration ubalgorithm has lin ear\nasymptotic computational complexity,\n\nA Cartesian Mesh Around an Attack Helicopter. containing 5.81 x 10\' cells. was generated by the algorithm in a computation time of 320 seconds on a\nmoderately powerful engineering computer workstation with a central processing unit running at a speed of 195 MHz.\n\n30\n\nwww.nasatech.com\n\nTech Briefs.

MPGT is\ndesigned to be a generic software tool that\ncan be configured to analyze any specified\nEarth-orbiting spacecraft mission.\nThe data are presen ted as a series of\noverlays on top of a two- or three-dimensional projection of the Earth. As many\nas six spacecraft orbital tracks can be\ndrawn at one time. Position data can be\nobtained by either an analytical process\nor by use of ephemeris files. If the user\nchooses to propagate a spacecraft orbit\nby use of an ephemeris file, then files in\nGoddard Trajectory Determination System (GTDS) format must be supplied.\nThe MPGT user\'s guide provides a complete description of the GTDS format so\nthat the user can create the files. Other\noverlays include ground-station antenna\nmasks, solar and lunar ephemerides, coverage by the Tracking Data and Relay\nSatellite System (TDRSS), a field-of-view\nswath, and orbit number. From these\ngraphical representations, an analyst can\ndetermine such spacecraft-related constraints as communication coverage, infringement of interference zones, availability of sunlight, and visibility of targets\nto instruments.\n\nNllI08!>9\n\n34\n\nFor More Information Circle No. 408\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 1999\n\nIt\'s Going To Be HOT\nIn Miami This November\nHOT Technology\nThe Technology 2009 National Technology Transfer Conference is coming to the Southeast for the first\ntime!

All\noverlays are generic, with communication-zone contour and spacecraft terminators generated analytically on the basis\nof pacecraft-altitude data. Interferencezone contour are pecified by the user\nthrough text-edited data files. Spacecraftorbit tracks are specified via Keplerian,\nCarte ian, or Definitive Orbit Determination System (DODS) orbit vector. Finally, all overlays related to time are\nbased on an epoch upplied by the user.\nA user-interface subsystem enables\nthe user to alter any system parameter\nthrough a series of pull-down menus\nand pop-up data-entry panels. The user\ncan specify, load, and save profile data\nfiles; control graphical presentation formats; enter a DOS shell; and terminate\nthe operation of the system. MPGT includes a menu option for printing all\ngraphical images by use of any printer\ncompatible with the HALO Professional\nsoftware.

Glenn Research Center, Cleveland, Ohio\nParallel Visual 3 (pV3) is an interactive\ncomputer program that provides selected displays of data generated in numerical simulations - especially simulations that involve parallel processing.\npV3 was originally designed to aid in the\nvisualization of numerical results from\ncomputational fluid dynamics (CFD) calculations on wlstructured as well as\nstructured computational meshes, but\ncan al 0 be used to display data from\nother calculations and to display intermediate computational results for diagnosis of simulation software.\nParallel processing is used to reduce significantly (relative to serial processing) the\ntime needed to perform complex numerical imulations of engines for purposes of\ndesign or analysis. Parallel processing is becoming common in industries (aerospace,\nautomotive, financial, and oil-exploration)\nthat rely heavily on computational simulations. As a result, there is a need for new\nsoftware tools that designers and analysts\ncan use to interact with computational simulations while the computations are in\nprogress. pV3 is an innovative visualizationaiding software tool that satisfies part of\nthat need. pV3 enables the viewing, steering, and under tanding of results of a sim36\n\nulation while the results are being generated in a distributed\nparallel computing\nenvironment.\npV3 was developed\nto support work in the\nemerging field of parallel application programs, as part of the\nparticipation of Glenn\nResearch Center in the\nPerformance\nHigh\nThis Image of the Interior of a Turbofan Engine was generated by pV3.\nComputing and Com- Images like this one are used to display results of Navier-Stokes compumunication (HPCC) tations of flow in the engine.\nproject.

A prototype of the applicator was used to depo it silicon carbide onto carbon fiber;\nthe design of the applicator can just as\nwell be optimized for coating fibers made\nof other materials, and for depositing\ncoating materials other than SiC.\nThere are two conventional techniques\nfor CVD on fiber. In one technique, a\nfiber is pulled through a chamber that\ncontains CVD reagent gases. The fiber enters and leaves the chamber through mercury electrodes that also serve as gas seals.\nThe fiber is heated to the reaction temperature by an electrical current applied\nthrough the mercury electrode/seals.\nThe disadvantage of this technique are\nthat it is limited to electrically conductive\nfibers, each reaction chamber can accommodate only one fiber at a time, and the\ntoxicity of mercury poses a hazard. In the\nother conventional technique, a fiber i\nheated in a waveguide-type microwave applicator. Although this technique is not\nlimited to electrically conductive fibers\nand does not involve mercury, it, too, is\nlimited to one fiber per applicator, and\nthe waveguide applicator is in trinsically\nenergy-inefficient because its proper operation depends upon absorption of a\nsubstantial portion of the incident microwave power in a dummy load.\nThe present microwave-cavity applicator\novercomes the disadvantages of the applicators used in both conventional techniques: It can be used to coat multiple\nfibers, the fibers can be electrically conductive or non conductive, there is no need for\nmercury, and microwave energy is utilized\nmore efficiently than in the older waveguide/ dummy-load microwave-applicator.\nwww.nasatech.com\n\nThe enhancement in energy efficiency\ni achieved by use of a resonant microwave\ncavity and by positioning the fibers in the\ncavity so as to cause only a small deviation\nof the electromagnetic field from the\nempty-cavity normal mode while cau ing\nthe fibers to absorb a large fraction of the\nmicrowave power that enters the cavity.\nThe positioning is especially critical for\ncoating fibers of carbon and other lossy\nmaterials; typically, such fibers hould be\nplaced near an electric-field node.\nThe figure is a simplified drawing of\nthe applicator. The major structural\ncomponent is a circular cylindrical microwave cavity. Microwave power is supplied through a coaxial transmission\nline and coupled into the cavity by a\ncoaxial rod antenna.\nThe electromagnetic field in the\nchamber is excited in a close approximation of a TMoNo mode, where i a positive integer. (The mode would be purely\n~. \'0, were it not for the small perturbations introduced by the objects described below.) The TMoNO mode is axisymmetric; therefore, to expo e\nmultiple fibers to identical microwave\nconditions, one need only take care to\nposition the fibers and other objects symmetrically about the axis of the cavity.\nThe cavity contains multiple (four in\nthe example of the figure) reaction\nchambers in the form of tubes made of\nquartz or other low-lo dielectric material. The reaction chambers are placed\nat equal angular intervals and nominally\nat the same radius. In operation, reagent\ngases are made to flow through the reaction chambers while the fibers are\npulled through the reaction chambers\nand heated to the CVD reaction temperature by the microwave field.\nABA Tech Briefs, August 1999\n\nEfficient utilization of the incident\nmicrowave power depends critically on\ngood impedance matche from the\ntransmission line through the antenna\nto the partially filled cavity, then to the\nfibers. The length of the rod antenna\ncan be adjusted for an impedance match\nfrom the transmission line to the chamber. The fibers must be po itioned at an\noptimum radius, which is nearer or farther from an electric-field node, depending on whether the fibers are more\nor less lossy. lots in the end plates of the\ncavity accommodate adjustments in the\nradial po irions of the reaction chambers and thu of the fibers.\nThis wark was done by Hmry W.

NPO-20585\nASA Tech Briefs, August 1999\n\nCAD Solid Model Assemblies to Mechanical Event Simulations\nand Faster Stress Analyses with Algor\'s New Kinematic Elements\n- -\n\n--------\n\nAlgor\'s Release 12 introduces 2- and 3-D kinematic elements, which produce massive speed gains in processing for a\nMechanical Event Simulation or static stress analysis. Kinematic elements can be used in place of regular (flexible) elements when an area of the model is relatively rigid when compared with regions of stress interest. Kinematic elements\ncan be constrained or loaded with force, traction, pressure or gravity. Because these elements have mass and can transmit forces, they can produce motion and stress in flexible elements. Engineers, therefore, can import CAD solid models\nor assemblies and specify which parts are to be modeled as kinematic or flexible elements, as appropriate. This means\nthat for the first time engineers can run a virtual experiment on complete CAD solid models or assemblies using\nMechanical Event Simulation on desktop computers.\nKinematic elements can interact with impact walls and other parts of an assembly\nmade of kinematic or other element types. Engineers can set up test runs of\nMechanical Event Simulations by modeling the entire assembly with kinematic elements and processing for motion only. This means the engineer can study the motion\nof the event to see if it works prior to adding regular (flexible) elements for the detailed\nstress analysis.\nKinematic elements can dramatically speed up processing runs for regular linear\nstatic stress analysis when Significant parts of the model are relatively rigid.\n\nr---------------------------------------------------------------,I\nwww.algor.com\n\nIGet a\ndemo video and CD\xc2\xb7ROM from Algor.\nI\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n:Complete this form and fax It to: +1 (412) 967-2781.\n\nOr c:ont.cI:\n\nInfo@algor.com I\n+1 (412) 967-2700 :\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI Add\n\n:\n\nI .\n\nI City\n\nWhen the Engineering\nHas to be Right\nI Algor, Inc.\nI 150 Beta OrNe PittstxJrgh PA 1523S-2932 US!\n: Phone: +1 (41\'2) 967-2760\nI Fax: +1 (412) 967-2781\nI California: +1 (714) 564-0844\nI Europe (UK): +44 (1784) 442 246\nI\n\n: Name\n\nCompany\n\n:\n\ness\n\nr\n\nState/Prov\n\nCountry\n\nZip/Postal Code\n\nI\n\n: Phone\nFax\nE-mail\n(kine-us) : E-mail: Info@algor.com\nL. _______________________________________________________________ .J Web: www.algor.com\nFor More Information Circle No. 514\n\nPolycrystalline Tb / Dy Alloy for Magnetostrictive Actuators\nThe cheaper polycrystalline version gives about 60 percent of the single-crystal magnetostriction.\nr,tlSA\' Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California\nRe earch has hown that with uitable\nproce ing, one can produce a pol crystalline ver ion of a terbium/ d pro ium\nalloy uitable for u e in a magnetostrictive actuator for generating mall motion .

The mechanical connection between the tepping motor and\nthe filter wheel is de igned to be as thermally isolating as possible, but it still leaks\nappreciable heat into the cryogenic system.

Heretofore,\nflows of liquid helium have been controlled by use of valves with mechanical\nor gas connections to actuators in\nwarmer locations. The connections act\nas heat-leak paths. In contrast, the deign of the present valve is optimized for\noperation at liquid-helium temperature\n(below 4.2 K) , 0 that the entire valve\ncan be maintained at or slightly above\nliquid-helium temperature to minimize\nleakage of heat into the liquid helium.\nA valve with some similarities to the\npresent one was described in "Magnetostrictive Valve for Use at Low Temperature" (NPO-19480) , NASA Tech Briefs,\nVol. 21, 0.2 (February 1997), page 14b.\nThe poppet in this valve, as in the previous one, is a ball contained in a passage\nbetween an inlet and an outlet. In this\ncase, the ball is made of 440C and is of\nhigh sphericity [root-mean-square deviation < 5 llin. (0.127 llffi)]. The valve seat\nis made of superclean, fine-grained 316L\nsteel and is initially lapped to optical flatness. In a later stage of fabrication, the\nball is used to "coin" the seat.\nAs in the previous valve, the actuator in\nthis valve is a magnetostrictive device comprising a rod of terbium/ dysprosium alloy\nsurrounded by a solenoidal drive coil that\ngenerates the magnetic field needed for\nactuation. The Th/ Dy alloy was chosen\n\nbecause it exhibits a large\nmagnetostriction in the\nintended cr ogenic operational temperature range.\nThe Tb/ Dy rod is\nmounted in such a way as\nto provide for removal\nand installation of different drive coils.

In particular,\nthis trend is having an impact on the\nindustrial automation and proce control indu trie , where customers worldwide demand, and reward tho e suppliers that provide, flexibility in control\nand automation products and the re ulting system in tallation.\nWhile product features and adaptation often result from oftware engineering, new mechanical packaging and\nhardware engineering approaches can\naddress the inevitable and often conflicting physical-layer issues that confront the varied users of automation and\ncontrol products.\nIn automation systems there are\nmany method of ystem interconnect.\nWhether they are directly attached to a\ngiven device, or at a sublevel wiring\ninterface, discrete wires provide the\nmost flexibility for system installation\nand expansion. The traditional barrier\nstrip has given way to the compact rising-cage clamp or European-type terminal block, especially for PC-board-based\nproducts (Figure 1). These PC-boardmount terminal blocks permit many\nvariations of wire-to-board connection\nto suit pecific mechanical packaging\nand electrical ignal and power need.\nThe den ification trend in field-wired\nproducts, and the trend toward packing\nmore and more components into smaller and mailer paces, began in Europe\nand spread to orth America, making\nthese blocks the world tandard for\ncompact wire-to-board field-terminable\nconnection .\n\nT\n\ntomers prefer pluggable terminal\nblocks becau e they provide an easier\nway to in tall , repair, and expand an\nin tallation.\nFor installation, the pluggable terminal block can be prewired, free of the\nintended device, easing the installer\'s\neffort in often difficult and cramped\nwork environments. The installer can\nthen mount the various automation\ndevices and plug in far fewer individual\nconnections, each containing multiple\ndiscrete wires. When a ystem error\nrequires physical-layer work, checking or\nreplacing an I/O, PLC, motor drive, or\nother automation device can be a relatively lengthy task. Pluggable terminal\nblocks can shorten system downtime.\nThe dilemma facing users of PCboard-mounted terminal blocks, pluggable or fixed, is that they sometimes\nconflict with the wiring requirements\nand practices in the cu tomer\' local\n\narea. In Europe, a di crete wire may be\ntripped of insulation and directly in erted into the terminal-block wire entry for\nthe circuit. Sometimes wire ferrule are\nused over the conductor to provide a\nrobust connection prior to installation\nin the terminal block. As long as the\nin tailed wire and wire-fixing mechanism of the in tallation are protected\nfrom a direct touch of the customer\'\nfinger-by using rece sed wire-entry and\nscrew tunnels-the installation is generally acceptable.\nThe practice and codes in the U ..\nand Japan, however, often require the\nattachment of spade or ring-lug terminals to the discrete wire before its in tallation in a device. This wire-lug combination i physically incompatible with\nthe generally accepted rising cage-clamp\nPC-board terminal block: the wire and\nits lugjust won\'t fit.

This was the experience of\nRick Pray, founder of RPA Electronic\nDe ign LLC in Binghamton, NY. RPA\'s\ncon ulting busine s is focused principallyon DSP, video, and graphic sy tern ,\nas well as orne embedded control and\nfield-programmable gate array (FPGA)\ndesign. Almo t every design that the\nfirm i hired to do requires maximum\nperformance from the hardware, but in\nD P, practically everything is geared\ntoward speed. Critical timing parameter must be met throughout in order to\nmaximize performance, and this means\nan absence of wait states.\nLast year one of RPA\'s clients presented the company with a timing problem\nin the proce ing modules that plug into\n\nmotherboard to build bigger, faster parallel proces ors. The challenge was to\nput a lot of static random acce memory onto the bus of a digital ignal proce or, within a very limited amount of\nspace, while maintaining zero wait-state\naccess. That meant that the proce sor\ncould not waste any bu cycle doing\nreads or writes to memory.

This creates\nthe risk of an overvoltage (OV) condition at the load if the remote sense contacts are incorrectly connected. A new\ntechnique to supplement standard OV\nprotection addresses this risk.\nPrevious upplemental protection\ndoe not protect low-voltage high-current loads. One must program a supplemental OV threshold high enough at\nthe output tenninals to accommodate\nthe expected Ohms-law (IR) voltage\ndrop in the cable, which re ults in a\nthreshold value that exceeds the maximum voltage the load can safely tolerate.\nLoad voltage can rise to damaging levels\nbefore protection acts. As one example,\na load is not protected if remote ense\ncontacts are horted together.\nA new supplemental method to pro..\nteet the load acts by monitoring voltage\ndrop in the output cable. A measurement circuit subtracts the remote ense\nvoltage from the power ystem\' output\nto determine a value for cable voltage\ndrop. The power system is shut down if\nthe measured drop violates a safe-operating area (SOA). The SOA is determined\nadaptively by measuring output current,\nand scaling it to repre ent the allowed lR\nvoltage drop in the cable. For scaling to\nbe effective, the output cable provided\nwith the power system must have impedance characteri tics that are defined in\nthe manufacturer\'s specification.\nWhen shorting the sense contacts\ntogether to produce a fault, the supplemental circuit sees a remote sen e voltage measurement of zero volts. The circuit\'s measurement value for cable voltage drop now equals the output terminal voltage. The power supply shuts\ndown when this value exceeds the cable\nwww.nasatech.com\n\nSOA by more than the allowed design\nmargin, which is well within a safe limit\nfor the low-voltage load. When open-circuiting either one or both sen e leads,\nthe condition pre ents itself to the circuit in the same way as shorting the\nsense leads together. This is because a\n\nlarge-value resistor shunts these leads at\nthe circuit interface. Protection is identical to the case with shorted sense contacts. Within the specified commonmode voltage range, this protection i\neffective against conditions of open,\nhorted, or polarity-reversed remote\nsense leads. The protection thre hold is\nalways below levels that would damage\nthe load, since the maximum allowed\ncable IR drop is below the load-damaging level by design.\nTo avoid generating fault ignals due\nto inductive voltage drops on the cable,\nthe supplemental circuit activates an output shutdown only if an SOA fault persists for more than one millisecond. This\nis simpler than adjusting the SOA to\ninclude an inductance characteristic. It\nal 0 has the benefit of improving noi e\nimmunity. One disadvantage is that it\ncreates a dependency on the performance of the output\'s slew rate. System\nperformance mu t limit the voltage\nincrease that can occur within the onemillisecond delay. Fortunately, for loads\nthat typify the system\'s output ftlter\ncapacitance in parallel with load re istance, the power system slew in current\nmode as it powers up, and the slew rate\nElectronics Tech Briefs, August 1999\n\nClJBB.ENI\n\n,...-----1 MEASUREMENT t-----t---r\nCIRClJII\n\n~nalpul=KI\n\nTO PERSISTAHCE\n\nIIMEB\n\n+\n\nDlEf.ERENIIAL\n\nMfASUREMf.NT.sJ:01i\\lERIEO\nTO SINGLE.ENOIDAND\nSUMMED\n\nTEST FOR\n\n\\lIQ.LATIQttQf\n\nCABLESOA\n\nBlock diagram of a sense circuit.\n\ndecreases as load voltage increases.\nSlewing near SOA limits is slow enough\nnot to present a problem during the\ndelay time.\nEarly testing was done on everal variations of the supplemental protection circuit to study the effectiveness in two system configurations. The configuration\nemployed short cables with low impedance, terminated using load resistance in\nparallel with large filter capacitance. The\nsecond configuration substituted long\ncables, in conformance with system\ndesign specifications. Resistors were sized\nto accept full-rated supply current at program voltage. The power supply was programmed to regulate program voltage at\nthe load; then output was enabled.\nTesting was repeated for all nine anticipated cases of misconnected sense lead\ntermination, and maximum transient\nvoltages seen at the load were recorded.\nIn-regulation testing was performed only\non the econd configuration by removing\neither sense lead from the energized\nload. The second configuration was also\ntested using higher-value load re istance .\nRe ults showed that the supplemental\nprotection circuit worked within its\nexpected parameters in every case tested.\nVoltage at the load during any tartup test\nnever exceeded 110 percent of the cable\nOA maximum limit with improperly terminated sense contacts, and the power\nsystem shut down as expected. During\nthe second te t, when either sense contact was opened, load voltage overshot\nonly minimally, then decreased LO zero.\nAll tests with improperly tenninated or\nopened sense leads resulted in protection\nof the load from damaging transient voltages, and a prompt hutdown of the\npower supply output with the appropriate\nfault flag being indicated.\nElectronics Tech Briefs, August 1999\n\nThis solution is a good fit for low-voltage high-cWTent load applications. It is\nalso a good candidate to use in place of\nthe earlier protection method for applications where maximum cable impedance\ncan be controlled. Since the new method\ndoes not depend on programmed overvoltage thresholds, there is less opportunity for user error to defeat the supplemental protection. Effective OV load protection is delivered against what is per-\n\nceived as an important fault condition:\nmisconnection of the remote sense leads.\nThis supplemental overvoltage protection scheme is used on selected Sorensen\nprogrammable DC power supplies.\nFar mare information, contact Don\nNovotny, marketing manager far Elgar/\nSarensen Co., 9250 Brown Deer Road, San\nDiego, CA 92121; (619) 450-0085; (800)\n525-2024;fax: (619) 458-0237.

As a result,\nbase drag - especially in the tran onic\nflight regime - is expected be very\nlarge. The unique configuration of the\nX-33, with its very large base area and\nrelatively low fore body drag, offers the\npotential for a very high payoff in overall performance if the base drag can be\nreduced significantly. This article presents results of a base-drag-reduction experiment that was performed in the X33 Linear Aerospike SR-71 (LASRE)\nflight program.\nThe experiment was a flight test of a\nroughly 20-percent half-span model of\nan X-33 fore body with a single aerospike\nrocket engine at the rear. As shown in\nFigure 1, the test model was mounted on\ntop of an SR-71 airplane. It was intended\nthat the LASRE flight-test data would be\nused to define the aerospike-engine performance under realistic flight conditions and to determine interactions of\nthe engine plume with the base and engine cowl areas.\nIn order to measure performance of\nthe linear aerospike engine under a variety of flight conditions, the model was\nmounted on the R-71 with a pylon that\n\ninstrumented with 8 load cell orificient for the entire body of approxiented to measure total force and momately 0.30.

For ubsonic\nflight condition , it has been demontraced that for objects with base drag coefficients greater than 0.30, the forebod / base drag relation hlp is extremely\nsensitive. For these flow conditions, a\nmall increment in the forebody friction\ndrag will result in a relatively large decrease in the base drag of t.he object.\nSince the subsonic lASRE base drag coefficient is 0.38, it is expected that the\nlASRE base drag/ forebody drag relationship hould exhibit a similar high sensitivity. Conceptually, if the increment in forebody kin drag is optimized with respect\nto the reduction in base drag, then it may\nbe possible to reduce the overall drag of\nthe configuration.\nIn the lASRE drag-reduction experiment, re earchers ought to increase the\nforebody skin friction and modify the\nboundary layer at the back end of the\nLASRE model. One of the most convenient methods of increasing the forebody\nskin drag is to add roughness to the surface. Such other methods as the use of\nvortex generators to energize the\nboundary layer would probably work\nmore effectively, but the intrusion of\nvortex generator into the airflow precludes the use of them on hypersonic reentry vehicles. The benefits of using surface roughness are nonintrusiveness\n(minimal heating) , small weight penalty,\nmechanical simplicity, and low co t.\nFor the lASRE drag-reduction experiment, # 24 silicon carbide [0.035 in. (0.9\nmm)] grit was glued to the skin by use of\npray-on adhe ive, and the sw-fuce was\nsealed by use of a high-lensil~trength,\nheat-resistant, white enamel paint. The resulting surfuce had an equivalent sandgrain roughne that varied between a~\nproximately 0.02 in. (0.5 rom) and 0.05 in.\n(1.3 mm). In an attempt to avoid inducing\nadditional flow separation at the boat tail\nor along the forebody, only the flat sides of\nthe lASRE model were gritted. The gritted area covered approximately one-third\nof the forebody wetted area.\nResults of the experimem verified that\nurfuce roughne can be effective in reducing base drag. Figure 2 hows the\nmeasured reduction in base drag, in comparison with the reductions in base drag\npredicted for surfuce roughnesses of 0.02\nin. (0.5 rom) , 0.05 in. (1.3 rom), and 0.10\nin. (2.5 rom). The predicted reduction\nin base drag ranged from 8 to 14 percent.\nThe base-drag reduction calculated from\nflight data peaked at 15 percenL The\nbase-drag reduction also persisted well\nout into the supersonic flight regime.\nASA Tech\n\nBriefs, August 1999\n\nSince base drag of upersonic projectile\nhad never before been correlated with\nviscous forebody drags, the izable reduction in supersonic base drag in this experiment was a significant positive result.\nnfonunately, flight-te t re ults for\nthe rough-surfuce configuration did not\ndemonstrate an overall net reduction of\ndrag. The surface grit caused a rise in\nforebody pressure . Coupled with increased fore body skin drag, the forebody pre ure rise offset benefits gained\nby reducing base drag. Clearly the technique used to apply the surfuce grit\nmust be refined. In addition, the exis-\n\ntence of an optimal coefficient of vi cous\nfore body drag must till be proven.\nThis WCJTk was done fly Stephen A.

The rotor would be connected by a shaft to an offthe-shelf dc brushless motor, which would drive the rotor at a\nblade-tip speed as close as possible to the thermal speeds of the\ngas molecules to be pumped.\nThe pump design must be synthesized in an iterative procedure that involves consideration of blade angles, number of\nblades per row, hub diameter, and of gaps among rotor blades,\nstator blades, the hub, and the inner wall of the pump housing.\nThe maximum pumping speed and compression ratio at smaller\nnumber of stages (pump size), predicted for a given combination of design parameters are evaluated with respect to the gas\nload or throughput.

Within this waveguide, powerful low-frequency electromagnetic signals, like\nthose generated by intense electrical discharges (e.g., lightning strokes) can travel great distances. Provided that a sufficiently sensitive radio spectrometer is used to measure the\ndispersion of a wave, the distance from a receiver to a lightning stroke or other source of the wave can be estimated\nfairly precisely from the measured dispersion, even if the distance is thousands of kilometers. Furthermore, by using two\ncrossed magnetic antennas (search coils) to measure mutually perpendicular horizontal components of the magnetic\nfield of the wave, one obtains the information needed to calculate the azimuth of the source. Thus, the location of\nsource, projected onto the ground surface, can be fully determined.\nElectrical discharges are expected to occur on Mars. These\ndischarges are expected to arise from dust storms, instead of\nfrom thunderstorms as on Earth and elsewhere in the Solar\nsystem. Electrically charged dust storms may act to transfer\nelectrical currents across long filamentary paths and may\nthereby radiate at frequencies <10 kHz. By exploiting the\npropagation of such waves within the natural waveguide between the Martian ionosphere and ground surface, one\nwould determine the locations of the discharge according to\nthe principle described above and would thus be able to track\nthe dust storms from one site on the surface. The range of detectability for the instrument is determined, in part, by the\nground conductivity (i.e., conductivity of lower boundary of\nthe waveguide) with reduced attenuation associated with\nhigher conductivities. Thus, an estimate of Martian subsurface conductivity can also be derived by the variation of discharge signal strength with distance.\nAn incoming electromagnetic wave would have magnetic\nvector components Ex and By where x and y denote mutually\nperpendicular coordinate axes aligned approximately with\ncorresponding mutually perpendicular axes of sensitivity of\ntwo search coils. Measurements of the waveforms and analyses of the spectra of both B.. and By would be needed to determine the degree of dispersion and the azimuth. The results of the dispersion and azimuth calculations would be\nused, in turn, to estimate the distance and direction to the\nsource of the wave. Waveform analysis would require sampling of Ex and By at a rate of approximately 20 kS/s.\nThe figure is a system-level block diagram of an instrument\nthat would perform the necessary measurements and would\nnot impo e excessive demand on telemetric resources. The\ninstrument would include two search coils mounted with\ntheir axes of sensitivity orthogonal to each other in a horizontal plane. The outputs of the coils would be fed to a waveform-capturing system (WCS).\nWCS would accumulate data continually in a circular\nbuffer which would pass the data to a telemetry buffer on\ncommand. The command would be issued in response to a\ntrigger signal generated by an external sensor whenever the\nsen or detected a di charge event. (The external sen or\ncould be a photometer, vertical electric-field sensor, or other\ndevice that is particularly sen itive to broadband ignaIs from\nlighminglike discharges.) Thus, the only data returned by the\nin trument would be those obtained around the time of a discharge, and the telemetric data rate averaged over long observing time would thereby be kept low. Each set of data thus\nreturned would be used to compute the distance and direction to a source.\nThis work was Mlle by W Farrell, M. Desch, M. Kaiser, and J.\nHOllser Of Goddard Space Flight Center.

(Inset shows construction site in Scotland.) Pipelines on the ocean floor will transport oil to the\nmain platform via oil-carrying risers within the platform legs. The oil will be\nprocessed and then carried ashore via separate export lines. ALGOR\'s\nMechanical Event Simulation software was used to determine the limits of\nprotection nets, which will be positioned at the top of two legs to prevent\nobjects from falling into the leg trusses and damaging oil-carrying risers.\n\nAdvances in computer-aided engineering technology are enabling\nengineers of all disciplines to create\nmore complex, detailed finite element models that realistically simulate the behavior of interacting systems. Recently, engineers at\nSelantic lndustrier A.S. in Agotnes,\norway\nused\nAccupak/ VE\nMechanical Event Simulation\n(MES) software from Pittsburghbased ALGOR, Inc. to simulate\na steel container impacting a\ndropped object protection net-a\nvirtual prototype test that previously could only be performed physically in a laboratory.\nSelantic engineers were asked\nby Technip-Geoproduction of\nFrance (Tech nip) and McDermott\nof the UK in partnership with ELF\nExploration UK PLC to develop a\nnew protection net for a \'Jack-up"\noil rig. This type of platform is constructed on hore a one complete\nunit and then towed into position\nat sea where its leg are lowered.\nOn contact with the eabed, its\ndeck is jacked-up above sea level.\nThe ELF platform is currently\nunder development in the orth\n\n62\n\nSea off of the East Coast of the UK.\nA protection net will be ituated\nwithin the trusse of two of the platform\' three triangular-shaped legs.\nEach net will be attached to a circular steel ring positioned just above\nthe leg.\nLoading cranes located directly\nabove the legs will transport shipping containers carrying supplies\nbetween the platform and ships\ndaily. The protection net will prevent falling containers from damaging oil-carrying risers, which are\nmounted in ide the legs and transport oil from the ocean floor. The\nengineers needed to restrict the\nnet\'s maximum deflection to protect the riser while ensuring the\nnet will with tand stres es created\nupon impact by a container.\nThe MES Approach\nLars Bjoland, technical manager of\n\nelantic lndustrier and an ALGOR\ncustomer for over seven years, is no\ntranger to ALGOR\'s finite element\nanaly is (FEA) oftware; however,\nthe protection net project was his\nfirst attempt at u ing ALGOR\'\nAccupak/ VE ME capabilities.\n\nwww.nasatech.com\n\n"In the beginning of the project, m colleague performed orne\nrough hand calculation to determine the be t approach for the net\ndesign," Bjoland aid. "We could\nnot make any olid conclu ion\nfrom hi work because it wa too\nvague. Performing the calculation\nmanually would be impo ible."\nThe next logical tep was to\nturn to FEA. Bjoland originally\nmodeled the net u ing Superdraw III, ALGOR\'s preci ion finite\nelement modeling tool, and\nreplaced the falling object with\nnodal forces acting directly on the\nnet. Bjoland was unsati fied with\nthis for two rea ons; calculating\nthe correct loading was complicated and time consuming and replicating the real-world behavior of\nthe net impacted by a container\nwas impossible.\nModeling the container and\napplying known phy ical properties\nsuch as its dimensions, mass and\nthe height from which the container falls enabled Bjoland to realistically simulate the interaction of the\ncontainer and the net within a\nshort time frame.\nTo set up the MES, Bjoland\nadded a container model to the\nexisting protection net model. The\nnet model was made of truss elements with three degrees of freedom. A rope would exhibit resistance only when pulled outward like\na cable when the object strikes the\nnet; thus, Bjoland did not consider\nbending moments.\nBjoland po itioned the 5,OOO-kg\nsteel container model, measuring 2\nby 2 m, approximately 12.6 m\nabove the net. The net had three\nsides, each 16-m long, and was terminated in each of the three corner with fully con trained boundary condition . He specified gravity\nfor the container. Bjoland designated contact elements between the\ncontainer surfaces and the net to\nenable complete interaction,\nincluding the transfer of inertia\nfrom one object to the other.\nThen Bjoland pecified the\nduration of the MES because he\nwanted to simulate the y tern\'s\nbehavior over time. After pecifying\nmaterial properties of steel for the\n\nASA Tech Brief: , August 1999\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\ncontainer and of aramid, a synthetic fiber, for the ropes, Bjoland\nproces ed the nonlinear elastic\nmaterial model with Accupak/VE.\n\nAnalysis Results and Modifications\nAccording to Bjoland, the initial\ndeflections exceeded Technip\'s\nfailure criteria of 2.6 m, the distance to oil-carrying risers beneath\nthe net. Bjoland performed everal\nvariation of the analy is, dropping\nthe container at the center, at one\ncomer and along the edge of the\nnet, to confirm the results.\n"After the first set of analyses,\nwe were able to determine that the\ncurrent net design would fail under\nthe extreme foading from the\nimpact," Bjoland said. \'Without\nAccupak/ VE, we would have been\nrequired to make a prototype to get\nthe same conclusion."\nTechnip revised the requirements and asked Bjoland to perform a modified set of analyses. The\nnew net design included ropes\nmade of a high-performance fiber\nHMPE\n(High\nMolecular\nPolyethylene), a lightweight fiber\nmaterial that is stronger and\nexhibits the best elasticity and\nbreaking strength. In addition, the\nnew design called for nine termination points at the comers and along\nthe ed~es compared to the previous\nde ign s three points. Three of the\npoints will be adjustable in order to\npre-tension the net\nThe modified set of analyses\nrevealed much more reasonable\ndeflections throughout the net and\nsatisfactory material dimension .\nStres es at the termination points\nwere higher, but within acceptable\nlimits, according to Bjoland. In\naddition, the MES showed that the\nnet would tretch permanently\nunder maximum loading. This was\nnot a concern because a net will be\nreplaced after each drop incident.\nTo present the results to his client,\nBjoland created .aui files from the\nME u ing ALGOR and converted\nthem to VHS video format.\n\nrial costs for prototype te ting as\nwell as decreased time-to-markel.\n"Had we not used Accupak/VE,\nwe would have needed to do fullscale testing to find deflection and\ntermination force ," Bjoland said.\n"We al 0 would have been required to perform additional\nphysical testing to determine the\ndesign modifications that we made\nafter the initial Mechanical Event\nSimulation."\nThis small-scale physical prototype testing is planned for 1999\nwith the platform becoming operational in the year 2000. Bjoland\nexpects to use Accupak/VE for\nfuture projects. "Engineers always\nneed to be open to new ways of\nolving problems to get the best\nresults,\' Bjoland said. "If we\nhadn\'t been open to a new method\nof modeling in this case, we would\nnot have been able to how the\nbehavior of the net as quickly or\ninexpensively.

The conversion of electrical energy into mechanical motion take place\nwithout generating any significant magnetic field or the need for moving electrical contacts. Dimen ional change are\nproportional to the applied voltage and\ncan therefore be adju ted with extremely high resolution.\nThe principle of operation of the INCHWORM is hown in Figure 1, and the\nphoto hows the Phase I prototype.

The first i\nthat the operating\ntemperature range\nis limited to 0-70 \' C, because the clamp\nand haft material have different thermal expan ion coefficients. As temperature drop into the cryogenic region, the\nhaft-to-clarnp fit gets tighter and the\nclamp will break. (At higher temperature the fit gets 100 er and the motor\nwill top operating.) In addition, the\npiezoelectric material lose 80 percent\nof its train and thu its capacity for\nmovement at 20 K..\nContinued\n\nClamp\nElement 1\n\nExtond\nEloment2\n\nClamp\nElement 3\n\nUnelomp\nElement t\n\nContract\n\nElemonl2\n\nClomp\n\nElemenll\n\nUnclomp\n\nEIemonl3\n\nFigure I.

Exploded vIew of the prototype NGST INCHWORM assembly (PZT stocks not shown).\n\nThe econd reason is that off-power\nholding force is not stable, because the\nclamp are honed to match the haft\nwith a small interference fit at zero volts\n(off power). This fit changes with temperature and wear, and this changes the\noff-power holding force , which typically\napproaches zero over the life of the\nmotor. Additionally, removing power\nfrom the motor cau es the exten ion\nstack to change length, which change\nthe shaft position by a few micrometer .\nASA\'s requirements for the NCST\'\nmirror actuators (Type 2) are summarized\nin Table 1. The most challenging requirements are the resolution, the operating\ntemperature, and the heat dissipation.\nThough the number of actuators to be\nu ed has not been et, it could range from\n240 to 3000. Even the lower quantity will\nrequire that the drive electronics be multiplexed between many actuators. The\nideal actuator will not change axial po ition more than two nanometers when the\nmultiplexed witching remove power.\nThe CST actuator must also be compatible with ultrahigh vacuum, and have a\nclamp-extend\xc2\xb7damp cycle life of at least\n50 million, with a low-frequency duty cycle\n\xc2\xab 25 Hz) .\n\nThe NGST Concept\nThe C T I CHWORM concept u es\nan "in ide-out" de ign with pringloaded clamp. Only one clamp channel\nand one exten ion channel are needed,\nin contra t to the three channels\nrequired by the clas ical Inchworm. The\nclamp upport the load when activated\n(extended ) and th e exten ion tack\nmoves th e load forward or backward.\n2b\n\nWhen the clamp is deactivated the inactive frame supports the load.\nCompressive pring preload eliminate\ntensile stre e in the clamp and create a\nreliable holding force when power is\nremoved and the clamps are discharged\nto zero volts. The output force is proportional to the preload force , and the spring\nloading inherently compensate for temperature change and wear. Another significant advantage of thi approach i\nthat, because the inactive frame supports\nthe load when power i removed, PZT\ncreep is eliminated as an error ource.\nBut everal technical challenges must be\novercome before the concept can become\nreality. An efficient spring preload mechanism and guide for the rails must be contructed. The mechanism must keep the\nclamp surface coplanar within 0.5 \\ffi1 as\nthe actuator is cooled to 20 K. And the\nclamp "glitch"- the axial motion forward\nand backward when a clamp occurs that\nnominally sums to zero--must be reduced\nto a few nanometers.\nBut the bigge t challenge, according\nto David Henderson , director of positioning products at Burleigh, i demontrating a cryogenic de ign that compensates for change in size and 10 of performance of PZT materials at low temperature . "We plan to use a new type of\nPZT material that has more train per\nvolt than conventional materials,"\nHender on says. "Our approach can\nwork continuously from room temperature to cold temperature , which give u\na significant advantage over alternate\ntechnologies. This mean that the ame\nhardware can be ground te ted at room\ntemperature and flown in space."\nwww.nasatech .com\n\nFigure 3.

Clearly, previous feedback\nsolutions, such as resolver technology and conventional\nencoders, no longer meet the increasing market demands for\nhigher accuracy and resolution, lower P factors, and easily\nadjustable commutation information- all of which must be\navailable in a single small, easily mountable package. An innovative approach by Stegmann Inc. for its Hiperface\xe2\x84\xa2 compatible feedback systems meets and exceeds these demands.\nThe Sin/ Cos by Stegmann is a Hiperface compatible feedback\ndevice developed for the drive market, offering better resolution\nand improved performance over traditional encoder technology.\nBenefits over an incremental encoder include a resolution of 4-8\nmillion counts, well above the 20,000 count of most encoders.\nAccuracy is \xc2\xb12-3 arcsec, compared to \xc2\xb12 arcmin for incremental\n\n{\'---~O rr\nrRC~\n\n1 \'l1r-(\n\'\n\n11 \'..,\n\nI III\nI\nI II\n\nII\n\nI\nI\n\nII\n\nI\nI\nI\n\nEQUAL\nDEFLECTION\nAND FORCE\n\nA Schematic of Hiperface, an eight\xc2\xb7wire interface standard that makes it\npossible to get commutation, speed regulation. and position information\nfr~m a single device.\n385 Gilman Ave., Wheeling.

At 50 rom in diameter, the\nSin/Cos is the maJlest multiturn absolute\nencoder in the world when compared\nwith devices that have similar performance ratings. It has an optional mechanical gearing system that lets it keep track\nof up to 4096 shaft revolutions.\nHiperface is an eight-wire interface\nstandard that makes it possible to get\ncommutation, speed regulation, and\nposition information from a single\ndevice. The physical interface includes\ntwo wires for an RS-485 link, four wires\nfor sine and co ine signals, and two wires\nfor the power supply, a reduction from as\nmany as 19 leads in traditional systems.\nThese innovative systems combine the\nfunctions of both incremental and\nabsolute encoders. The absolute value in\nthese systems is calculated only when the\ndevice is initially turned on, and is then\ntransmitted via the RS-485 interface to a\ncounter in the drive. The drive in turn\nuses this initial absolute value for the\ncommutation of the motor and also as a\npointer to identify the exact period of\nthe sine/co ine signals that it is currently evaluating. The drive then increases\nthe base resolution of the sin/cos signal\nby interpolating these signals in the drive\nwith an A/D converter. The final result\nafter 12-bit interpolation, when using a\nfeedback system with lO24 periods per\nturn, is more than 4 million counts.\nAn advantage of using sine and cosine\nsignals to transmit the position information is that a very low-frequency signal can\nbe used to provide extremely high resolutions. This is because the incremental signal is not transmitted in the common digital data format of A-quad-B. as with conventional encoders, but rather as analog\nsine-cosine voltage over the process data\nchannel. This signal is then interpolated\ninsi.de the drive unit\'s input circuitry to\nget the increased resolution. This low-frequency signal can be transmitted without\ndifficulty over considerable distances.\nThe resulting benefit is that the drive\ncircuitry can be designed to handle only\nas much bandwidth as is required; this\nrange in actual practice depends on the\nshaft speed at which the feedback de\\ice\nwill operate. For instance, a servomotor\nusing digital signals at speeds of up to\n6000 rpm, and a desired resolution of\n20,000 pulses per revolution, needs a\nbandwidth of 2 MHz. If a Sin/Co motor\nfeedback system from Stegmann is used, a\nbandwidth of only 102.4 kHz is required.\nHiperface compatible motor feedback\nsystems also outperform existing feedback device in accuracy. Motor feedback systems provide signal linearity of\nthe sine/co ine signals down to \xc2\xb15 arcsec, resulting in total system inaccuracies\n(including mechanical mounting of the\nMotion Control Tech Briefs, August 1999\n\nencoder and A/D conversion in the\ndrive) of less than \xc2\xb130 arcsec. This is at\nminimum a tenfold increase in accuracy\nover today\'s conventional incremental\nencoders and resolvers.\nBy integrating a nonvolatile memory\ndevice into the system, important data\ncan be stored in the feedback device and\naccessed over the RS-485 link by the\ndrive when needed.

In an application in which the\ncoupling works on a Heidenhain encoder for an X-V table\nthat positions circuit boards, representatives of the user\ncompany and of Servometer determined that it was a flexing\ntype failure rather than a torquing failure. There were two\ncouplings per handling machine, and calculation showed\nthat the peak torque transmitted through the coupling was\n0.22 in.-oz. After a thorough analysis, it was clear that the\nexi ring bellows coupling was failing because of offset, since\nthe failure was in the first convolution closest to the end\npiece.\nThe engineers followed up by determining the maximum\noffset, and a Servometer bellows coupling wa chosen that\ncould handle the offset, the small amount of pos ible bending, and the small mount of torque . The choice was confirmed by another division of the same company, which had\nbeen using the recommended coupling without encountering a problem. Servometer says the company is using the\ncoupling for new handling-machine production.\nThit vmrk WflS donf at Servometer Inc.
