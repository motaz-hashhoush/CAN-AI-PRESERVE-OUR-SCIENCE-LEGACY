The development was motivated by the need to monitor and assess the effects of extended weightlessness, which include space motion sickness and loss of bone and muscle mass. The results may lead to developments of effective exercise programs and drug regimes that would maintain astronaut health. The analyzer containing the lab-on-a- chip includes materials to extract 3- methylhistidine (a muscle-loss indicator) and Risedronate (a bone-loss indicator) from the urine sample and detect them at the required concentrations using a Raman analyzer. The lab-on- a-chip has both an extractive material and a SERS-active material. The analyzer could be used to monitor the onset of diseases, such as osteoporosis.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 20100001342, "id": "455fe9c1fac046bca9ef3baf5a18710e", "publicationName": "NASA Tech Briefs, January 2010", "publicationDate": "2010-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 20100001335, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "NASA Tech Briefs, January 2010", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20100001342.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20100001342/downloads/20100001342.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20100001342/downloads/20100001342.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20100001342/downloads/20100001342.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
