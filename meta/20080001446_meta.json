The related changes in ball bearing life are incorporated in life factors that can be used to modify the bearing predicted life using the Lundberg-Palmgren equations and the ANSI/ABMA and ISO Standards. Two simple algebraic relationships were established to calculate life factors LF(sub c) to determine the effect of inner- and outer-race conformity combinations on bearing L(sub 10) life for deepgroove and angular-contact ball bearings, respectively. Depending on the bearing type and series as well as conformity combinations, the calculated life for deep-groove ball bearings can be over 40 percent less than that calculated by the Lundberg-Palmgren equations. For angular-contact ball bearings, the life can vary between +16 and -39 percent from that calculated by the Lundberg-Palmgren equations. Comparing the two ball bearing types, the life factors LF(sub c) for the deep-groove bearings can be as much as 40 percent lower than that for angular-contact ball bearings.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 20080001446, "id": "44b75fa7d4d5467a98e090e2c1ae3d48", "publicationDate": "2007-09-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20080001446.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20080001446/downloads/20080001446.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20080001446/downloads/20080001446.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20080001446/downloads/20080001446.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
