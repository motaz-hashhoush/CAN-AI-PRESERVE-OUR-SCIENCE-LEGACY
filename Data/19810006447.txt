Magnan\n\nDirector of the Ecole des Hautes Etudes\nProfessor at the Collbge de France\nIntroductory Lesson\t\n\n/5*\n\nIt is not without some emotion that I take tr\xe2\x96\xbay place today in that\ngreat scientific institution, the Collbge de France, which has acclaimed so many famous scientists in the four hundred years of its existence.\nI therefore wish to convey before starting my lecture how much I\nam touched by the honor that Mr. Croiset, the administrator, and the\nprofessors at the Collbge have paid me by accepting me as a colleague\n\nto teach the science of bird and mechanical flight.\nIt is not without apprehension that I prepare to teach this subject\nin an institution where that great scientific genius Marey has covered\nsimilar topics.\nI hope that my temerity will be pardoned. Much of the research\nthat I will analyze is in fact a continuation of his work, and most of\nthe new data could be obtained only through the use of his marvelous\ninvention, the motion-picture camera,\nI also want to express my appreciation to all those who have aided\nmy scientific work. First of all, there is Mr. Laurent-Eynac, Minister\nof the Air Force, who, with the approval of the Minister of Education,\ndecided to establish the chair of animal mechanics as applied to airplanes at the same time as he was planning an Institute of Fluid\nMechanics.\nScience should be grateful to Laurent-Eynac for this innovation.\nHe understood the important role that scientific research was beginning\nto play in the field of aviation, and did not want the Americans or\nthe Germans to have a monopoly in aerodynamics. He not only encouraged\nresearchers to work together in a close and fruitful collaboration, but\nalso created new positions at the universities for doing the teaching\nand research that were vitally necessary.\nit must also be added that if today I have the honor of being a\nprofessor at the Collbge de France, it is because of the sympathetic\nsupport and encouragement that my own professors have given me. These\ninclude Professor Painleve, that great expert in fluid mechanics and\none of the fathers of aviation; Professor Cavalier, Director of Higher\nEdducation; Professors d\'Arsonval, Bouvier, Koenigs, Rateau, and Vincent, all members of the Institute; and Professor Fortant, Inspector\nGeneral of Aeronautics, who supported my work, as well as giving me\nindis pensable encoura erient. My heart-felt thanks to all of them.\nNumbers on the margin indicate pagination in the foreign text.\n1\n\nFor at least the past hundred thousand years, living beings have\nbeen flying through the atmosphere. They have been supported by wings\nthat are merely the transformed anterior limbs of earth -bound creatures.\nAmong the precursors of animal flight, some, like the archeopteryx,\nwere rather small, the size of a chicken. Others, such as the pteranodon, were practically airplanes with movable wings. They resembled\ngiant bats with a wing spread of as much as ten meters and a weight of\n300 kg. Thus, in a period when nature was enamored with bigness and had\ncreated the diplodocus, she had also designed a kind of living airplane with fabric-covered wings and the weight of modern passenger air-,\nplanes.\nAs Pitois has so well described it in his work on the origins of\naeronautical navigation (published on the occasion of the official Aeronautical Exposition in 192.6) 0 the, ancients also dreamed of rising into\nthe air like birds. Well before the twentieth century, bold attempts at\nflying occurred. It must be pointed out that is was these attempts that\ngave birth to aviation. Ovid has given us the .story of Daedalus, the\nfirst airplane builder, and of Icarus, his son and the first pilot, who\nwere victims of their audacity and temerity. This legend proves that\nalready during the epoch of King Minos, people contemplated copying birds.\nThe apparatus invented by Icarus was very primitive. it consisted of\nartificial wings made of feathers bound together with a linen core and\nwax coating the outside. This is what caused the lc5a of Icarus.\nIcarus had been advised by his father not to fly too high or too low.\nHowever, he went so high into the air that, as a result of excessive\nstress, the wax gave way and the first wing failure in\nresulted.\n\nrecorded history\n\nAlthough such ancient attempts at flight seem more. legendary than\nreal, others seem closer to reality or are even known to have taken\nplace. The authors of these attempts had the same idea as Daedalus.\nThey tried to unlock the secret of flight by imitating the birds.\nTwenty centuries after Icarus\'s death, the monk Olivier de\nMalmesburg \'followed in his footsteps. De. Malmesburg built a winged\nstructure that resembled that of Daedalus as much as it did that of\nLilienthal. He then launched himself from the top of a tower in an\nattempt to glide back to earth. Instead of crashing into the ocean like\nhis predecessor, de Malmesburg hit the ground and broke both legs.\nA hundred years later, an Arab tried to keep himself up with the\naid of a sort of parachute with a wicker frame. lie jumped from the top\nof the hippodrome at Constantinople and died.\nAt about the same time, a locksmith in Sabld constructed a\nrudimentary device and actually succeeded in making several short\nflights.\nThen, in the fourteenth century, J.B. Dante of Perugia claimed\nto have been successful in trials with well-designed wings above\nLake Trasimeno. He tried to repeat this success above Perugia, but\nfell on the roof of St. Mark\'s Church and broke a thigh bone. Nonetheless, Dante\'s experiments aroused so much interest that Dante\n\n2\n\neventually received a chair in mathematics at the University of Venice.\nIt was not until the eighteenth century that new attempts at\nflight were made. One such attempt was made by de Bacqueville, who\njumped from the window of his townhouse, which was situated not far\nfrom the Institute. He succeeded in flying above the Seine: for 100\nmeters. Unfortunately, a loss of speed caused him to crash into the\nroof of a wash-house and die.\nA hundred years later, at the end of the nineteenth century, new\nexperiments were made by the German Lilienthal. Using a glider of his\n\nown design, Lilienthal successfully made over a thousand flights in\n1891 before he was finally killed.\nHis method was to takeoff from a cliff against\'the wind. He\nconstantly tried to extend his flight, and his apparatus became more\nand more sophisticated.\nLilienthal\'s test flights lasted only two or three z\xc2\xabinute:s at\nmost. During these flights, he worked at perfecting his piloting\nability and, thanks to some careful observations, the capabilities of\nhis equipment. He thus paved the way for powered flight, which after\nall is only gliding with the additionof an engine for motive power.\n\nit was precisely this powered gliding that Lilienthal\'s successors\nsought to achieve.\nOne of Lilienthal\'s imitators was the Englishman Pilcher. Pilcher\nlifted himself off the ground by driving a team of horses at full\n\ngallop while suspended in his glider. When he had reached a certain\nheight, he released the reins. Pilcher also died in a crash.\nWe should also mention the Americans Herring and Chanute, who\nwere experts in flying, like the Wright brothers. Until 1903, the\nWright brothers limited themselves to glided descents to learn how to\nmaintain the airborne equilibrium of their afrplane and to discover what\nkind of control mechanisms were needed in this vehicle. The final\nresult of this series of tests was the magnificent performance at\nAuvour in 1908. On this occasion, W. Wright!nade a two-hour flight at\n60 km per hour in a biplane equipped with only an 18 hp engine. Flying\nalong with him to observe was Painleve, who thus became the first passenger as well as the first mathematician to make a first-hand observation that the laws of attraction were relative. Whilepowered flight\nwas gradually evolving in America due to the tenacity of the Wright\nbrothers, it was also coming into being in France. The French approach\nwas somewhat different. Efforts just as tenacious as those of the\nWright brothers went into creating engines that were powerful enough\nto lift into the air and to sustain in flight any airplane that could\nthen be built.\n\n/7\n\nThe first successful test of a powered airplane was in fact that\nof Ader, who in 1897 flew a motorized airplane that was modeled on the\nway a bat flies.\n\n3\n\n6b\n\n,... I\n\n___\n\n_\n\n,\n\nThe next successful tests were made in 1906 by Santos- Dumont,\nBleriot, Esnault-Pelteri,e, Farman, Delagrangeo and Ferber. They\nbegan by making little more than leaps through the air, but then\nprogressed to short flights. It must be stressed that it was\nadvances in automobile engines that made these flights possible.\nThe necessary light-weight internal combusion engines developed\nprimarily for automobiles were then adapted for use in flying machines.\nSoon the goal seemed to be to.transform airplanes into projectiles.\nAs Painleve has correctly observed, "Research efforts concentrated\non the motor and to some extent on the propeller, i.e., the propulsive force, to the exclusion of wing design and the relationship\nbetween wing type and driving mechanism. The dream was to rush\nthrough the air like a meteor while at the same time enjoying a\nstate of equilibrium and security, to maintain oneself in the air\nby smashing into it with such force that the caprices of the fluid\nenvironment could be disregarded. Behind the dream lay a paroxysm\nof incredible violence. In the \'life or death struggle\' with time,\nspace, and the deadly force of gravity, this route imposed\nitself on human intelligence and the resources of modern industry.\nIt also brought about the war, that imperious and ferocious mistress\nwho could no longer be kept waiting."\nIn 1906 airplanes could attain only 45 km/h. By 1911 they has\nreached 120, 200 in 1913, 430 in 1924, and can fly at speeds of M,\nthan 500 km/h at the present time. it is obvious to say that this\nprogress is not yet over and that one day much greater speeds will be\nseen, i\'Ather by flying at higher altitudes or by using jet engines.\nThere is more than one type of possible motive force. The birds\ndon\'t have propellers and they fly perfectly well all the same.\nAs L. Breguet has stated in an informative lecture on aviation,\nits past and future, none of the progress in the fight against\ngravity would have been possible if the pioneers of this heroic\nepoch had not relied on laboratory scientists to provide them with\ninformation on how to design the best possible machinery. Many\npeople worked in this field. Eiowever, not much has really been\nsaid on the subject. The basic laws of aviation, at least concerning\nresistance to bird and mechanical flight, were discovered by Newton\nin 1670. They state that fluid resistance is perpendicular to the\nsurface, and that it is proportional to the square of the speed,\nto the density of the fluid, to the surface area, and to the\nsquare of the sine of the angle of incidence. The only part that\nhas been significantly changed involves the last variable. Its\nrelation to resistance was modified by Colonel Duchemin.\nReynolds, in 1874, proved that the coefficients of the formulas\nthat contain the square of the speed are not constant for certain\nvalues of the product of the speed multiplied by the linear dimension\nof the object under consideration.\nIn any case, all these formulas are only applicable to flat\nsurfaces. There have been no studies made on curved surfaces. We\nare completely ignorant of the characteristics of surfaces shaped\nlike those of birds.\n4\n\n/8\n\nWhile the engineers and pilots were carrying out their work in\nthe limelight, others accomplished their tasks in the background. We\nmust state our recognition of the achievements of these men. First\nof all was the great scientist Colonel Renard who not only built the\nfirst dirigible, - but also made an important contribution to the science\nof aerodynamics. Then there was Eiffel who invented the wind\nw\xe2\x96\xba .ich was used to collect invaluable data on air resistance at the\nAuteuil laboratory. Around 1909, A. Rateau made another series of\nmeasurements of air resistance utilizing a similar wind tunnel. The\nfans and turbines in the tunnel. enabled Rateau to study the phenomena\nof flujd flow with a great deal, of precision.\n\ntunnel,\n\nRateau also invented the supercharger for use on engines at highaltitudes., Without this device, rapid air travel would not be possible.\nThese and other studies which have been carried out in every country\nhave made many important contributions to aviation. They have resulted\namong ether things in the improvement of the lifting force of wings and\nmore streamlined airframes.\nin a related area, the marvelous flying ability of birds continues\nto be an object of fascination for researchers. Do the wings of birds\nhave some special, still undiscovered characteristics? Many people\nhave sought an explanation for birds\' flight beyond just magic. Numerous others, meanwhile, have tried to prove that human beings can fly\nbetter than birds. They have braved storms to demonstrate that it is\npossible for us to travel long distances at 200 km/h and that we can\ncross the Atlantic in two days. At the same time, there are others who\nstill claim that birds are the best flying machines. Birds never crash\nbecause of Loss of speed. They make use of all the resources of nature\nand can fly immense distances and climb up to 9000 and even 10,000\nmeters intothe air. Who is right? Those who think copying avian flight\nis a step backward, who are proud of their mechanical ability, and who\nbelieve that they have beaten the bird on its own territory, or those\nwho seek their inspiration from nature? Which is the better machine?\nThe airplane has a heart of steel and wastes an enormous amount of\nenergy. It cuts through everything in its path with an incredible\nracket, as F. Painlevd has so well described.. The bird, on the otherhand, has only a little engine that runs on almost.--no fuel. For example,\na pigeon can fly at 80 km/h for five hours without stopping to eat,\nand therefore without expending a great deal of energy. Birds lose\nalmost no weight during flight. They take advantage of the force of\nthe wind rather than fighting against it.\nMany still think that the mystery of wrian flight must be\ncleared up for the benefit of aviation.\nResearch has been done in every direction. Examples of the studies carried out include those concerning the wing spread, the weight,\nand the strength of birds.\nWhat errors were made at f?,zst y Mention was made of condors with\n\xe2\x80\xa2 6-meter wing spread, and of albatrosses that weighed 25 kg and had\n\xe2\x80\xa2 5-meter wing spread. Observation has brought these figures closer\nto reality: 3 1/2 meters for the albatross, which is still pretty big,\nand a tail width of 23 cm, with an aspect ratio of 17. Navier once\n\n5\n\ncalculated that a swallow required 25 hp to fly. This calculation\nresulted in the term "Navier\'s error."\nIt is only in the last fifty years that a team of scientists has\ntaken up where: Archytas, the inventor of the screw, left off in trying\nto copy the movements of birds. They have pretty much succeeded in\nclearing up the mystery of live flight. In 1891, Penaud and Trouvd\norganized test flights of fifty met.es:z with a moving wing machine.\nAnother researcher, Marey, who was a :.:ntarkable inventor, attempted to\ndetermine precisely how birds flew.\nI should say first of all that Marey\'s book on the flight of birds\nis perhaps the most complete and perfect analysis that has been made\nup until now of a single wing movement. All the methods of experimental physiology were brought into play to examine its details. There\ncan be nothing more ingenious than the dynamometric device that was\nplaced across a pectoral muscle in a sort of corset to detect changes\nby means\nin the length of the muscle. The dynamometer was\nof a tube 10 cm long to another device which plotted the myographic\ncurve on a cylinder while an electric chronograph recorded at what\npoint the bird began to raise and lower its wing.\n\nconnected\n\nI obviously cannot describe in this first lecture the results of\nMarey\'s experiments on this subject. I also will not describe the\ntricks he used to discover the exact path that the wing makes in motion.\nHowever, I do want to touch upon his invention of "chronophotographs", or motion pictures. This invention, as a result of the influence of the Lumiere brothers, has become a device for entertainment\nand propaganda that has made its power felt throughout the entire world.\nFrom the scientific and aeronautic points of view, it has also been\na very important instrument. It has been absolutely indispensable in\nstudying bird and airplane flight, and was in fact invented by Marey\nfor this very purpose.\nMarey, as a great scientist and fore-runner, had an idea of the\npotential of motion pictures.\nNot only did he invent cinematic photography on a moving film,\nbut he also thought of possible uses of his invention. These include\nstudies of walking (human and quadruped), of swimming, of flight, and\nof microscopic animals. He thought of using movies to record the trajectory of a glider in the air and thus to investigate the laws of\nresistance for moving objects of various forms. These are examples of\napplications in the physical sciences I stress that Marey did not\nactually make any of these experiments, but he thought of them.\nMarey completely understood the importance of his invention and\nits superiority over similar systems. He claimed that his method\nwas simpler and more sensitive thanthe others for recording\nevolution of a phenomenon. This was because no matter how complex\nthe situation that was being investigated, motion pictures do not\ninterfere at all with what is going on. This is certainly not the\ncase for mechanical methods of recording motion.\n\nthe\n\n6\n\nt\n\nI will not argue that the future of aviation lies in copying\nnature. However, I am going to show how it is linked in part to\nthe study of what nature has done. The laws of physics were created\nby nature herself, and she knows them better than we do.\nBirds and bats fly through the air to travel from one point to\nanother. From this point of view, flight is not much different from\nwalking or swimming either on the surface or under the water. All\nthese methods of displacing a living organism are characterized by\nthe prolonged continuity of the phenomenon as well as by the existence\nof a basic cycle that is repeated indefinitely, as long as the\norganism wants to continue moving.\nFlapping flight in birds is a system of alternating propulsive\nshocks. The air constitutes only an indirect su pport. The immediate\nmotive effect is due to the inertial reaction of the body with the\nmoving wing during the downward thrust (the first phase of a flap).\nThe same distinguishing features are to be found universally, in\n\never-, 7 species of bird and flying mammal. The uniformity of flapping\nflight in living things is much greater than the similarities to be \t\nfound in comparing, say, the motion of a horse, a tiger, and a human\nbeing\n\n/10\n\nFlight rhythm can differ in frequency but not in pattern. When\ncomparing a walk with a trot and a trot with a gallop, however, the\npattern itself is found to change.\nShould we continue to use airplanes in which the propulsive force.\nand propeller are independent of the body of the airplane and act upon\nit like any other external force, as if it were pulling the airplane\nwith a rope, for example?\nShould we, on the contrary, try to constuct apparatus in which the\nmotive force is not distinct from the body, but would fly by means of\nreactions with the environment, changing periodically in size, direction, and point of application?\nShould we agree with the people who contend that movable wing\naircraft are not practicable?\nBut who can foretell so definitely what the future has in store?\nRemember the prediction of the famous astronomer Lalande. He\nstated that it was absolutely impossible that human beings could rise\nup and fly in the air. The use of movable wings for elevation was just\nas impossible as the use of hollow bodies voided of air, according to\nhim. Lalande\'s calculations showed, fuethermore, that a human being\nwould need wings with a surface area of 107 m 2 in order to fly.\nTwo years later, the Montgolfiere was invented and Bldriot crossed\nthe English Channel in an airplane that had only to m 2 of lift surface.\nAs I have said, a bird does not lose any weight when flying\nfrom Paris to Brussels. The aerodynamic efficiency of its body is\nI\t\n\n^\n\n7\n\nvery great, so it glides most of the way and needs only a small\namount of power.\nPre -war wind tunnel. tests showed that a natural wing made of\nbones and feathers is infarior to the wings of an airplane. Lafay\nfound that the drag to lift ratio was llt for a Bldriot blade,\n20% for a pigeon wing, and 4% for a whole pigeon.\nThe conclusion to be gathered from this is that birds have a\ndifficult time flying and encounter a great deal of air. resistance.\nIt follows that avian flight is very exhausting, if not impossible,\nand demands a great deal of energy. However, experience has shown\nus that the amount of energy consumed is very small and that the\ngracefulness and maneuverability of a bird is very great. A dead\nwing must not have the same characteristics as a living one. It\nis easy to prove this by studying the trajectory that birds follow.\nHuguenard and Planiol developed for us cinematic equipment\nthat can be used to photograph on the same film a bird and an\nairplane in flight, a chronometer, and a network of reference lines\nfixed to the ground a little way in front of the objective.\nTo accomplish this, a combination lens was designed that\nallows cwo objects at widely varying distances from the camera to\nbe photographed in focus at the same time. In collaboration with\nHuguenard and Sainte Lagut we showed that it was possible to derive\nthe lift and air resistance from the paths followed by birds and\nairplanes in flight. We could thus compare the flight-worthiness\nof various kinds of apparatus.\nIn this manner, we found that a swallow, for the onl y polar curve\npoint that was obtained after multiple attempts, had an aerodynamic\nefficiency of 19.5, whereas a good fighter plane had a maximum\nefficiency of less than 5. A bird is therefore at least three times\nmore efficient than an airplane and much better suited for flying.\nThis is why it requires only a very small motive force.\nBirds do not just glide or fly by flapping their wings. They\ncan also soar without using any energy at all.\nMany tourists have observed birds rising up into the air without moving their wings. Above cliffs at the edge of the ocean,\nsoaring birds performing maneuvers that last a considerable length\nof time without moving their wings may be seen daily. Some, like\nthe sea gulls, rise up almost vertically with their wings spread out\nand their beaks usually pointed into the wind. The initial rise\nfrom the crest of a wave is rather rapid, then they slow down as they\nreach their final altitude, which is highly variable. They look\nas if they are riding in an elevator. Having reached a certain\nheight above the water, they stay there for a while. Then they\nslide through the air and lose altitude only to start all over again.\nSeagulls are also capable of flying horizontally without\nmoving their wings. They turn to face the wind and fly sideways\nalong the cliff in one direction or the other. The trajectory is\nalmost parallel to the upper edge of the cliff. In order to do this,\n8\n\n/11\n\nr\nthey turn the axis of their bodies so that their head is pointed in\n\nthe direction in which they want to\n\nmove.\n\nSea gulls make no sharp turn to change direction. They merely\nmodify the direction in which the axis of their body is pointed when\nthey want to change direction.\nIn the tropics, the soaring of vultures similarly presents a\ngrandiose spectacle. Mouillard, who was a remarkable observer,\ndescribed the flight of vultures in the following fashion:\n\n"These are the kings of the air, always soaring ... They slowly describe immense circles, without any sudden jerks or stops..\n"As I have said before, a large vulture can fly without a\nsingle flap of its wings. Not once, but hundreds of times, I\nhave seen large numbers of vultures in oriental cities hovering\naround slaughterhouses, waiting for their food while keeping\nthemselves aflight without a single movement of their wings. They\nrise so high as to be invisible and then descend back to 220\nmeters above the ground, with the wind, against the wind, to the\nright, or to the left. They evon fly off to explore the surrounding territory to see if there isn\'t some dead animal that is\neasier to get hold of. In the course of the day\'s tour they make\ntwenty ascents of 1,000 meters each, and travel 100 leagues\nwithout beating their wings even once."\nThere is another type of soaring that is even more impressive than\nthose I have already mentioned. This is the flight of the large oceangoing birds such as the albatross. Their rhythm is practically always\nidentical, as they carry out, without ever flapping their wings, ascents,\ndescents, and almost vertical turns. They skim the surface of the\nwater, usually between two waves, then turn to face the wind and rapidly rise to twenty meters. After another turn they return close to the\nsurface of the water. This cycle is repeated endlessly as the birds\ntravel immense distances, even circling the globe.\nAlthough naturalists had long ago discovered the existence of\nsoaring\', until the end of the nineteenth century no serious experimentation had been carried out on the question. This kind of flight\nwas shrouded in mystery for a very long time.\nSome curious souls soon noted that there was an obvious correlation between soaring and the presence of wind. The wind then became\nthe basis of the various theories advanced to explain soaring. However,\nsince not much was known of the structure of the wind, many errors were\nmade.\nWhen I began my study of soaring in 1914, using a flexible wing\naircraft to carry out experiments in horizontal winds, it was clear \t\n/12\nto me that the nature of the wind had to be studied. Unfortunately, this\nnecessity was not recognized by airplane manufacturers of the period.\nThe means available to me to carry out my research were thus in-\n\nsufficient. I was not even able to make a rough evaluation of the\nusable energy contained in the wind.\nr\t\n\n9\n\n\t\n\nIn\n\n1922, Huguenard,\n\nPlaniol and I decided to build a very\n\nsensitive anemometer capable of measuring rapid variations of the\nwind. As our experiments progressed, we quickly realized the extent\nand complexity of soaring. We needed more than an anemometer to detect the structure of air currents. We also required an indicator of\ninstantaneous direction for studying the atmosphere. A pilot would\nneed a whole group of dashboard instruments to have a sense of atmospheric movements. In birds, the ability to sense changes,in the air\nwas attributed to a mysterious instinct.\nWe were led to design and build special devices which were as\ndelicate as those found in physics laboratories.\nWe invented a hot wire anemometer with a compensating battery.\nWe also needed a device for measuring the instantaneous direction\nof the wind with the same period as the anemometer. It occurred to us\nto use hot wires also to record the directional fluctuations in air\ncurrent. We thus constructed a simple apparatus by placing two identical hot wires inside a cylinder and equidistant from the axis of\nsymmetry of this cylinder.\nThis equipment allowed us to take up the study of wind structure.\nThe data already collected in this field was very small. It must be remembered that it was only fifty years ago that Langley proved that the\nwind had a variable speed, and that until Lilienthal discovered them\nthirty years ago, variations in wind inclination were unknown. The hot\nwires enabled us to discover that variations in inclination are greater\nnear the ground than at 2000 meters and very much greater than over the\nocean. This alone, however, was not enough to calculate the trajectory\nof a glider or a bird. Besides the wind speed, direction, and inclination for any given point at which the bird or airplane was located,\nit was necessary to known the time derivatives of these variables. We\ntherefore built an apparatus for automatically plotting the curve\nof the change in wind speed and angular velocity over time.\nj\t\n\nJust as with balloons or smoke, hot wires can be used to determine the average speed of ascent of the air. During the course of\nthese studies it was noted that temperature inequalities, like\nvariations in terrain, cause ascending air currents.\nWhen the sun beats down strongly upon the earth, the ground heats\nup and then gives up heat to the air with which it is in contact.\nThe air becomes lighter as it increases in temperature and rises\nup into the atmosphere, giving birth to ascending currents.\nAscending currents are also caused when horizontal winds hit an\nobstacle (cliff, mountain, tree, etc.) and are force upwards around it.\nAll these experiments, which were repeated in areas where soaring\nbirds are active, have increased our understanding of the mechanics\nof the different modes of soaring and have shown that:\n1) Sea gulls, which follow coastal cliffs, make use of the ascending current created by these obstacles.\n10\n\nt\n1J\n\n2) Vultures take advantage of the rising currents caused by heat\nto perform their great circling flights in warm countries.\n3) Albatrosses use variations in wind speed to support themselves\nin the switch-back paths they follow above the ocean.\t\n\n13 s\n\nOnce the mystery of avian soaring was solved,. human beings were\nable to successfully imitate two of its modes. Like the sea gulls,\npeople have used rising air currents to take off from the tops of cliffs\nand glide for as long as 11 hours. People have also been able to\ntravel as far as 150 km by using the rising thermal currents that\nexist under some kinds of clouds. This is a great victory for mankind.\nHowever, it could only have been obtained with the aid of experimental\nstudies. The mathematical methods with which some people have tried to\nsolve such problems have been shown to be completely inadequate for\ndescribing avian flight. Only research into the external envirnoment\nand the characteristics of the soaring birds themselves could have\nfurnished the key to the puzzle.\n\nThis essential point\n\nmust be stressed It was only in 1922 that\n\npeople could for the first time imitate one of the flight patterns of\n\nbirds. It is true that powered flight required that science had advanced to the point of inventing the internal combustion engine. However, Daedalus was capable of building a glider indentical to present\nmodels made of wood lathes and varnished canvas. Icarus, just like\nManeyrol, could have remained suspended in the air for several hours if\nhe had suspected the existence of rising currents of air along cliffs.\nIt was precisely this ignorance of external conditions that caused\nLilienthal to fly through ascending currents in front of his launching\nhill without being able to take advantage of them.\nWind studies have still another area of interest. The acceleration of the wind is not only responsible for keeping a glider in the\nair but also for the extra stress on the framework of an airplane that\nresults from atmospheric turbulence. The usefulness of measuring and\nstudying such turbulence is obvious.\nThe flight of birds and airplanes is usually examined in "standard atmospheric conditions" as defined in experimental physics. Standard conditions are an abstraction, an ideal limit that can only be\napproached in anartificial environment and have no direct relation to\nthe actual atmosphere. The arbitrariness of this procedure is incompatible with what we already know. Although the air maintains an\nappearance of homogeneity and continuity, it is nevertheless the site of\nall sorts of more or less periodic phenomena. Aviation cannot afford\nto ignore these phenomena because they are closely associated with the\nforces brought into play by the material system formed by the bird or\nairplane and the air around it. We must become acquainted with the\nundulations of the atmosphere.\nPortant, the Inspector General of Aeronautics, has pointed out\nthat when studying maritime history, one is struck by the fact that\nseveral thousand years passed before people began to get an idea of\nthe dynamics of waves, even of those created by the passage of a boat\nthrough water that was originally calm. However, these two kinds of\nagitation, which superimpose their effects when the water is not calm,\nhave always had a significant influence on the propulsive efficiency of\n11\n\nr\n\nboats, their use and their safety. Now, atmospheric navigation does\nnot count its age in millennia, but only in decades. Almost nothing\nis yet precisely known about the undulatory movements in a turbulent\natmosphere, nor, which is even worse, about the undulatory agitation\ncreated when an aircraft passes through the air. The ability of aircraft to withstand dangerous vibrations caused by turbulence or by the\ninteraction between atmospheric agitation and the oscillations and\nvibrations that aircraft produce cannot be predicted.\nIt was thought until recently that the increased stress undergone 14\nby an airplane flying in turbulent air never exceeded 1/5 g. Huguenard,\nPlaniol and I, with the aid of a mercury accelergoraph that we built,\nshowed that unfortunately this is not true.\nWe attached this instrument to a Gourdou-Leseurre 180 hp airplane\nin such a way as to record the maximum component of acceleration normal\nto the wings. The maximum value attained was 6.5 g during flattening\nout. We also found that the magnitude of this value was greater than\nthe acceleration due to gravity in a wind of 10 m/sec. In such a wind\nthe airplane was supporting twice its weight.\nThis is also true for birds. Huguenard and I discovered this using\na small accelerograph that weighed only 50 grams, and measured 7 cm\nlong by 3 cm high. Despite its small size, it was able to record the\nvertical acceleration of the bird upon whose back it was attached.\nHowever, for a bird, gusts of wind are not just something to be\nendured, as they are for an airplane. It is able to anticipate the\ncoming changes in speed and direction of the wind and takes advantage\nof them. This ability is not linked to mysterious sense organs, but\nto gust strength indicators.\nI now think that the mysterious sense that birds were thought to\npossess actually is based on the elementary laws of mechanics. Their\nsense organs simply allow them to estimate when a gust is coming.\nFirst of all, any change in the wind causes a change in lift force\nwhich raises the bird up, as in an elevator. We all know that this\nkind of ascending motion is perceptible because of the effect it has\non the weight of our bodily organs.\nIn the bird there is another indicator of gusts that is even more\ndirect than the sensation of acceleration. Through the intermediary\nof the wing skeleton, their weight is supported by the wing muscles.\nThe amount these muscles are stretched depends on the stress on the\naerodynamic stress caused by the wind is\nwing. Any variation of\nimmediately translated into a variation of muscle tension. A very\nsimple dynamometer indicating muscle activity could thus directly\nindicate the passage of gusts. This is exactly the method Huguenard,\nPlaniol and I used. We constructed a wing stress indicator that\nenabled us, after static airfoil tests, to calculate the aerodynamic\nstress that the wing undergoes from the measurement of wing deformation. This instrument works by comparing fluid levels. It has the\nfollowing advantages:\n\nthe\n\n12\n\n\t\n\nl) It allows the pilot to constantly survey the stress endured\nby the wing during flight maneuvers or when passing through air\nturbulence.\n2) The normal stress caused by aircraft maneuvers and atmospheric\nconditions can be determined. This would contribute to the establishment of standard safety factors for airplane construction.\n3) The aging of aircraft can be constantly checked because the\nindicator also detects permanent deformations, which no accelerometer\nis capable of.\nThe report that I have just made shows that the scientific study\nof avian flight is not the only field that calls for this type of\ninstrumentation. Meteorology, aerology, powered aviation, and aeronautics in general face analogous problems. This apparatus has already\nmade a contribution to their solution.\nI would also like to show that the study of fish swimming is of\ngreat interest, too, even for aviation.\nFew experiments have been carried out in this area, even fewer \t\nconcerning the efficiency ratio of fish bodies. I , believe that F.\nHoussay is the first person to study the resistance that a piscine\nbody encounters when in motion.\n\n/15\n\nHoussay, who was a professor of mine, was one of the most creative\nscientists that I have ever known. A partisan of the theory of evolution, he thought that the external environment played a considerable\nrole in the life of an animal. This is why he tried to demonstrate\nexperimentally the influence^of diet on the physical constitution of birds.\nHe was particularly interested in the flight of birds and the\nand he published an important monogra ph on this\nswimming- of fish# \t\nlatter question in 1912. The first data on the strength of fish are\ncontained in his book.\nHe also wrote several lengthy books on "form and life" in which\nhe expressed some completely novel ideas, whose importance was later\nrecognized. Among other things, he thought that the fish\'s body was\nplastic, and that it had been molded by the water. Its form was therefore perfectly streamlined. Any time perfect form is not attained, the\nwater knocks against and rubs away the imperfection until it is reduced\nto the smallest size possible.\nHoussay tried to study the form and efficiency of different types\nof hulls. To do this, he constructed a set of models all having a.\nmaximum width of 34 mm, the same surface finish, and only differing\nas to form. Six oblong shapes were chosen. Sixteen meters above the\nground, he nailed a board holding a rudimentary pulley through which\npassed a rope. With this pulley he hoisted a more precise pulley carrying a fine wire. At one end the wire was attached to a weight and\nat the other end it first passed through a pulley 50 cm under the\nwater and then was attached to one of Houssay ` s models.\n\n13\n\nThe models were then immersed by a boat in the water of a large\npond. They were allowed to move a horizontal distance of 16 meters,\nequal to the height of the weight. The time was measured with a Breguet\nchronometer, which was started by a device fixed to the wire and\nhalted when the boat touched the land.\nFor each model # a peries of different weights was attached to\nthe wire in order to obtain different rates of speed.\nHoussay found that the hull modeled after a fish (which resembled\nfish like the red gurnet more than it did slender fish like the trout)\nwas surpassed only by a hull with a large rear end. The addition of\nfins made the fish model the best of all.\nAlong with Sainte Lague, I followed up on these experiments by\nusing real fish.\nEven now it is thought that resistance is approximately proportional\nthe square of the speed. We wanted to see what was the law\nof resistance for fish. All the experiments carried out to study\ncorporal resistance until then had involved solid bodies held by an\narm or drawn by a rope. The interaction of the support and the\nfloating body could render the results inaccurate.\n\nto\n\nThis is why it appeared necessary to us first of all to find a\nway of\nany exterior support. A means of propulsion interior to the body was needed. The force of gravity furnished us with\nthis means.\n\neliminating\n\nWe chose fish with a range of forms. Immediately after their\ndeath, we measured their weight and buoyancy. We then weighted\nthem down by putting particles of lead in their mouths. This gave\nthem a certain speed of descent in water without changing their outward form. Each fish was then suspended above a tub full of water with\nall its fins folded up except the tail fin. It was then released and\nfell straight down, with the head first because of the lead ballast.\nWe filmed the descent of each fish through a set of reference\t\nlines simultaneously with an oscillating pendulum. Examination of\nthe speed curves showed that for practically all the species studied,\nthe time elapsed was directly proportional to the square root of the\ndistance falleit. This is the same as saying that the resistance encountered is constant, at least for speeds of less than 2 m/sec, which\nwas the maximum attained by the fish.\n\n/16\n\nThe proportionality of %/R` and t, or of x and t2, implies a law\nof descent identical to that of gravity, i.e. a law of constant\nacceleration. Since the excess of weight over buoyancy is constant,\nthe force of resistance is also constant.\nThis was the case for most of the fish we studied, such as the\nmackerel or the meager. It was not true for the skate, whose spherical body encountered increased resistance with growing speed.\n\n14\n1 .4\n\nThese results demonstrate the importance of such experimental\nresearch and the interest it has for aviation. They clearly indicate\nthat there exist situations, which are not even suspected, i:n which\nthe most established physical laws or the most generally accepted\nideas do not hold.\nThe study of the phenomena of fluid flow around a moving body\nis therefore far from complete. The theory of fluid mechanics\nis not sufficiently advanced at the present time to produce reliable\npredictions.\nThe mathematicians and technicians roust not be held in contempt\n\nfor this. On the contrary, theory and mathematics are indispensable\nfor the advancement of science. They just have to be based on experimentation or verified by experiments. Progress in a science like\naeronautics can take place only if experimentation is given all the\nplace it deserves.\n\nlC:\nr\n\ni\n\nRECOMMENDED READING\nBr@guet, L, "L\'aviat on d\'hier et de domain" [Aviation Yest-arday and\nToday"], Conflrence f..aite h Rouen au Congres de 1\'Association\nfrangaise pour le relevement das sciences (1921).\n\nFortant, "Les mouvements ondulatoires de 1\'atmosphere et leur action\nsur les appareils volants" ["Atmospheric !Undulations and their\nEffect on Aircraft"], Communications\nA6ronautique (1929-30) .\n\na lv Association\n\nMaritime et\n\nHoussay, "Forxne, puissance et stabilit y des pojissons" ["Form, Power,\nand Stability of Fish"j, Coll. de Morph dyn, no-4, Paris (1912).\nHuguenard, Magnan, Planiol "Les appareils h fil chaud: lour application\na 1 1 etude des mouvements atmospheriques ("Hot Wire Apparatus:\nTheir Application to the S*udy of Atmospheric Motion"), Bulletin\ntechnique du Service Technique de 1\'A6ronautque, no. 32 (1926).\nHuguenard, Magnan, $ainte Lague Sur une determination expdrimentale\nde la polaire d\'un avion et d\'un oiseau en vol" ["On the Experimental Determination of a Polar Point for an Airplane and a Bird"],\nC.R.A.S., October 1, 1928.\nMagnan, Sainte Lague, "Nouvelles experiences sur la resistance h\n1 1 avancement des poissons dans 1\'eau" ["New Experiments on the\nResistance to the Advance of Fish in Plater"] C.R.A.S.

As you know,\nthe chairs of the Collhgo, de France have been established to allow\nresearchers t., publicizE the results of their work. I am thus only\n\nfollowing tradition.\nThe flight of birds and airplanes raises numerous problems,\noriginating in both the characteristics of the birds and airplanes\nthemselves and in the properties of the external environment, i.e.\n\nthe atmosphere.\nAn analysis of flight is therefore possible only if air currents\nand struriture are studied.\' Researchers in every country ha:,e had to\ndesign instruments capable of obtaining the necessary information, or\nat least the .rough data needed for a first examination of the question.\nGenerally speaking, the instruments made for use in meteorology are\ncompletely unsuitable for studying the interaction between wing surfaces\nand variable winds. In addition, the behavior of certain factors which\nplay an important role in this interaction,such as the density of air,\nis poorly understood in the neighborhood of an airplane.\nThese considerations have led to experimental attempts to measure\nthe rapid variations of certain parameters, although previously only\nthe .average value was needed.\nThe branch of physics that deals with the study of the atmosphere\nand its movements and which is closely connected to aerodynamics is\ncalled aerology. It is a very active area of research in Germany but\ndoers not receive enough attention in France. However, aerology is in\nfact the study of the environment that is encountered by aircraft in\nflight. It investigates the character of the different lagers of the\natmosphere as well as air currents and wind. Meanwhile, aerodynamics\nfocuses on the forces exerted on moving surfaces in the air and the\npressures felt by a body exposed to air currents. It is obvious that\nprogress in aerodynamics and its application to aviation are linked to\nprogress in aerology. Much attention must be paid to atmospheric\nstudies before aerodynamics can move forward. It is by the scientific,\nempirical study of the atmosphere that the problems of flight will be\nunderstood, since the airplane, like the bird, is dependent on the\nproperties of the air as it flies through it.\nI. The Composition of the Air\t\n\n/17\n\nAs everyone knows, the atmosphere is a mixture of gases. In fact,\nthis mixture is more complex than co-Monly thought. The proportions\nof the gases that make up the atmosphere are the following:\n\n17\n\nDensity\n(H s 1)\nNitrogen\nOxygen\nArgon\nCarbon Dioxide\nHydrogen\nNeon\nHelium\nKrypton\nXenon\n\n78.03\n20.99\n0.94\n0.03\n0.01\n0.0015\n0.00015\n0.00005\n0.0000006\n\n13.92\n15.94\n15.96\n22.09\n1\n9.96\n1.98\n41.50\n\n65.35\n\nThis is the approximate composition of the lower layers of the\natmosphere. The exact proportions vary according to atmospheric:\nconditions.\nII. General Properties of Gases and Air\n\nLet us review the general properties of gases so as to be able\nto understand the rest of this article.\nMatter is divided into three states: solid, liquid, and gas.\nSolid bodies have a fixed shape that remains constant, as\ndoes the volume, if the temperature does not change.\nLiquids, on the contrary, have a form that is easily changeable.\nThey are unstable. Liquids mold themselves to the objects that\ncontain them, but their upper surface remains free and horizontal.\nThe volume of liquids changes only a little with increasing pressure.\nGases have a completely different _nature. Their molecules are\nhighly mobile and have a tendency to separate off from the others.\nThis is why these bodies are always ready to expand. They always\nfill up the space that encloses them and only the force of a wall\nis capable of limiting their expansion. On the other hand, the\nvolume of a gas Can be reduced a great deal. from its initial size.\nGases are therefore very expandable and very compressible.\nIf a tube, one of whose ends is sealed while the other is\nfitted with a piston, is filled with air, it is possible, by pushing\nin the piston, to reduce enormously the volume occupied by the air.\nThis is because of its compressibility. However, a growing resistance\nis felt as the volume is reduced. As soon as one stops pushing on\nthe piston, the air acts like a spring and pushes the piston out as\na result of its expandability.\nWhen the temperature changes, all bodies, solid, liquid, or\ngas, change volume. They expand when heated and contract when cooled.\nHowever, gases expand a lot more than liquids, and liquids expand\na lot more than solids. At constant pressure, if the temprature\nincreases from 0\xc2\xb0 to 273\xc2\xb0, the volume of a gas is doubled.\n\n18\n\nNevertheless, gases are also viscous. They also weigh something\nand have a characteristic density. To prove this, take a 10 liter\nvessel fitted with a valve and evacuate it. Then weigh it and let\nthe air ,return. The weight will gradually increase until the total\ngain is 12 grams. This experiment proves that the weight of a\nof air is 1.2 grams. If the experiment had been carried out at a\npressure of 760 mm and a temperature of 0 \xc2\xb00 the weight of a liter of\nair would have been found to be 1.293 grams. The density of air is\nthus 770 times less than the density of water.\n\nliter\n\nLike other gases, air exerts a force, either from the inside to\nthe outside on the walls of receptacles in which it is contained, or\nfrom the outside inwards on the surface of objects surrounded by air.\nThis force is always normal to the walls of containers or the\nsurfaces of bodies.\nSince gases are also compressible and fluid, they s*.em analogous\nto liquids. The fundamental principles of hydrostatics concerning\nthe equilibrium of liquids, which were discovered by Archimedes and\nPascal, are based on the compressibility and fluidity of liquids.\nThey therefore also hold true for gases.\nIn order that a gas be in equilibrium, each of its points must.\nbe pressed equally from every direction, as is the case for liquids.\nGases therefore exert an equal pressure at every point of a container.\nThe pressure on any point in a gaseous mass is transmitted equally in\nevery direction. The total force on a surface is proportional to the\nsize of the surface.\nIt is because of the transmission of pressure equally in every\ndirection that a soap bubble swells up and takes on a spherical form.\nIn a manner similar to liquids, when a body is plunged into the\nair it undergoes an upward force equal to the weight of the air that\nit displaces. The body loses a part of its weight equal to the weight\nof the air displaced. As some people have put it, this is Archimedes\'\nLaw applied to stationary fluids.\nThus, if a small balloon is filled with hydrogen, it rises into\nthe air because it weighs less than the volume of air displaced. If\nsmall objects of greater and greater weight are attached to it by a\nstring, there comes a moment when the balloon stops rising and remains\nin stationary equilibrium. The weight of the balloon and that of the\nobject suspended from it are then equal to the upward force exerted by\nthe air.\nThese are the properties that have been applied in the construction of small balloons for launching atmospheric soundings and of\nlarger balloons for airborne transportation.\nFinally, Stevin\'s Law is also applicable to gases. This law\nstates that the pressure exerted by a liquid in equilibrium on the\nhorizontal bottom of its container is equal to the weight of a\ncolumn of the liquid whose base has the same area as the bottom of\nthe container and whose height equals the height of the liquid in\nthe container.\nit follows from Stevin\'-s Law that the difference\n19\n----\n\n19\n\nbetween the pressure exerted at two different points of a liquid in\nequilibrium is equal to the weight of a column of the liquid having\na base one unit in surface area and a height equal to the distance\nbetween the two points. This too is true ,for gases.\n\nIII. Geneta1 Properties of the Earth\'s Atmosphere\nAll these considerations will help us to understand\nobservations first made a long time ago concerning the earth\'s\natmosphere, i. e. about the layer of air that\n\nsurrounds our globe.\n\nFirst of all, it is clear why the air that covers us did not\ndisperse into space a long time ago. The reason is found in the\nearth\'s gravity which keeps the molecules of gas that make up the\nair close to the surface.\nIt is also -understandable that\nlower layers of the atmosphere,\nwhich support the upper ;Layers, are denser than them. This is because\nof the comresssability of the air. The lower layers also have a \t\ngreat elastic force, as Pascal has shown. If one climbs a high\nmountain with a balloon half filled with air, the higher one goes\nthe more it will expand.\nAll objects in contact with the air are pressed upon by a\npressure known as atmospheric pressure. The existence of this\npressure was proved by an experiment attributed to Toricelli, who\nused an instrument called a barometer. This instrument consists of\na tube 90 cm long wr it(7 a cross-sectional area of 1 cm and closed\nat one end. It is filled. with mercury, and then, after having been\nplugged with a finger,, is turned over and its free end is submerged\nin a pool of mercury (figure 1). The height of mercury in\'-the\ntube then falls, but stops approximately 76 cm above the surface of\nthe pool. A balance is thus established between the pressure\nsupported by the square centimeter of surface below the bottom of\nthe tube and the pressure exerted on a square centimeter of the\nupper surface of the pool. The pressure of the air is thus equal\nto the weight of a column of mercury having a base of 1 cm and a\nheight of about 76 cm:\nP = 1 x 76 x 13.6 = 1,033 gr/cm2\nThis pressure has been designated one atmos phere pressure. At\nsea level it is commonly approximated as 1 kg/cm .\nOne\ntubes of\nare less\nwould be\npressure\n\ncan make the same demonstration with other liquids, but\na-greater height will have to be used because other liquids\ndense than mercury. Thus, for water, a tube 10 meters long\nnecessary because a column of water supported by atmospheric\ncan be as high as 10.33 meters.\n\nFor a column of air to be in equilibrium with the pressure of\nthe atmosphere, 1 kg per square centimeter would be needed. This\ncorresponds to a height of 8000 meters, if the air is uniform throughout.\n\n20\n\n/20\n\nVide\n\nJ6\n\nFig. 1\t\nMercury\t\nBarometer\t\n\nFig. 2\nRupture\nChamber\n\nFig. 3\nVidi\nBarometer\n\nKey: a) vacuum\nIt is interesting to show how great the force is that is\nexerted on an object by atmospheric pressure. One way this may be\ndone is with a small glass container known as a rupture chamber.\nThis vessel is open at one end and covered by a membrane on the other.\nThe shape of the. membrane is constant as long as there is. \'air on both\nsides. If the uncovered end of the glass is attached to a vacuum\npump and is partially evacuated, the membrane first bends inward\n(figure 2), then pops under the weight of the air. One can also get\nan idea of this pressure by noting that our body has a surface area of\nabout 17,000 cm 2 and therefore supports a total of 17,000 kg. Such a\nweight does not crush us because the liquids that fill the cavities\nand tissues of our body counterbalance the pressure of the atmosphere.\nOther experiments have proved that atmospheric pressure goes down\nas altitude increases, as would be expected from the hydrostatic law \t\nexplained above.\nIn the atmosphere, the reduction of pressure per meter of altitude\nequals the weight of a 100 cm volume of air, or 0.13 grams per cm2.\nIV. The Measurement of Atmospheric Pressure\nThe most precise laboratory instrument for measuring the weight of\nthe atmosphere is a mercury barometer. As everyone knows, this weight is\nvariable at ground level and diminishes as one goes up in altitude.\nVidi Metal Barometers\nHowever, because of their delicacy and the difficulty in transporting them, more convenient metal barometers have been invented.\n\n21\n\n/21\n\nUnfortunately, metal barometers must occasionally be compared with\nthe readings obtained from mercury barometers if one wants to assure\na consistent degree of accuracy.\n\nMetal barometers have many uses. In meteorology, they serve\nto measure and record the value of atmospheric pressureon the ground.\nThey are used in aeronautics to indicate and record the variation\nin pressure when a balloon or an airplane rises higher in the air.\nIn this case they are called barographs. The markings on the dial\ndo not necessarily represent centimeters of mercury. They can also\nbe read in height above sea level in order to tell the pilot the\naltitude at which the airplane is flying. The instrument is then\ncalled an altimeter.\nMeta], barometers are in general, made of a flat box. On the\nupper side, the box is sealed with a thin flexible metal plate\nand the air inside is evacuated. The curvature in the plate\nincreases as the atmospheric pressure increases. The movement of the\ncenter of the plate, after being amplified, is transmitted to, a\nneedle (figure 3) .\nThe construction of actual instruments designed in this\nmanner is difficult. Especially for aeronautic use, they have to\nbe very accurate and give consistent readings. Any hysteresis\nthat exists must therefore be eliminated as completely as possible.\nBecause of the importance of possessing accurate instruments\nin this field, Huguenard, Planiol, and I have created a type of\nbarometer and altimeter based on entirely different\nmechanical principles.\nH.M.P.

OA tries to move in the direction of P when\nno other force is exerted on it (except for the force that holds 0 in /22\nplace). If a torque c is exerted on AOB, the piece is displaced by an\nangle a (assumed to be small), which is proportional to c and inversely\nproportional to the ambient pressure. Contrary to what happens in\nordinary instrtunents,the result is that the torque causes a rotation\nthat increases as the air becomes more rarefied. This is because the\nrestoring torque created by atmospheric pressure acting on the device\ndiminishes along with this pressure.\nIn the H.M.P. barograph or altimeter, the force acting on point B\nof the arm 08 perpendicular to the compensating arm OA is the result of\nt\na spring. The initial tension of the spring as well as its elastic =\n-stanrechosatbinherqudsnitvyheapratus and the desired amount of displacement of the needle.\nIf the spring is very flexible, the difference between its tension\nof the ground and at the maximum altitude will be practically zero. The\ndeviation of the needle will then be practically proportional to the\nreciprocal of the pressure, and its sensitivity will increase with\naltitude (figure 5) .\n\t flexibility is\nIf, on the other hand, a spring with only\nchosen, the sensitivity of the barograph will be constant. The increase\nin deviation will be proportional to the increase in altitude, at least\nunder standard atmospheric conditions.\nThe first arrangement is adopted for a barograph destined for high\naltitude use. The second type is chosen for dashboard altimeters used\nin normal navigation.\nb) Sylphon Capsules\n\nThe evacuated boxes employed are actually tubes, or capsules, made\nof special hard brass. Their form resembles that of a cylindrical\nbellows made of parallel plates connected by half toruses.\nFor the most common types that we used, the diameter of the plates\nis approximately 2/3 the exterior diameter of the toruses, and the\nthickness of the walls is about 0.15 mm. The number of sections of the\nbellows is usually between 1 and 12..\nThe elastic properties of the bellows are a result of their\nspecial form that confers upon them total superiority over the concave\ncapsules found in ordinary barometers. The precision obtainable is much\ngreater than before.\nThe range in which elastic deformations occur is much larger and\nthe proportionality between stresses and deformation \xe2\x80\xa2is much closer.\nThe following experiments prove this in an incovtrovertible fashion.\nThey have been executed on a four -chambered bellows with an interior diameter of 40 mm, an exterior diameter of 60 mm, and a total height\nof approximately 20 mm.\nl\n23\nA\t\n\n.\n\nFirst Series: Depression Tests\nThe first series was carried out using a field microscope equipped with an eyepiece marked with crosshairs. Each division on the crosshairs was equivalent to 5 microns on the object being examined. The\nobject was a special sighting mark in this case. It was attached to\nthe moving end of the bellows. The other end of the bellows was restrained by a fixed support.\nThe displacements of the sighting mark were measured with the aid\nof the micrometric eyepiece. They corresponded to the reduced pressure\ncreated inside the bellows, which were measured by a water manometer with\na precision of 1/4 mm of a column of water.\nIN \xe2\x96\xba\t\nPressure reduction (mm of H2O) 1 \xe2\x96\xba\t\n41N \xe2\x96\xba\t\n4UNI\t\n11N1\t\n24 K1\t\n11\nMicroscope reading\t\na\t\n13.1\t\n1-411\t\n411L14\t \'NoI\t\n1:1,\'I\t\n1\nDisplacement in mm\t\n11\t\n41.67 1,315 2.111 1,315 0.67.5 0.40-)\nDifference between ascent\nand descent readings in mm \t\ni\xe2\x96\xba,1N1,\xe2\x96\xba IMM15 11\n\n/23\n\n11)\n\nr\n\nAs may be seen above, the maximum error in measurement is\n5/2000 or 1/400 of the total value.\nSecond Series: Load Tests\nThe measurements were made by focusing a fixed crosshair microscope on a microscopic object located at the bottom end of the capsule\nwith known weights suspended from it.

It is\ndifficult to explain this large an error. It could equally well come\nfrom errors in reading the displacement as from an actual difference\nin the displacement of the bellows.\nc) Design of the Altimeter\nThe altimeter was designed and built to enter general use as a\nspecial dashboard instrument.\nWe therefore wanted to provide all the characteristics required of\nthis type of equipment, including graduations proporticsnal`to altitude.\nRequiring proportionality is very logical since it facilitates the\nreading of the instrument and increases the precision of interpolations.\nFor such interpolations to be possible, large divisions in the dial are\noften also necessary because of the poor visibility that exists in flight.\nA linear scale also allows the meter to be easily set at zero to\naccount for the pressure at the airfield.\n24\n\n\t\n\nOur goal was therefore to create a very sensitive apparatus with\nan absolutely linear scale. Contemporary altimeters a my achieve this\nproportionality at the expense of a loss in precision. Cams or complic\nated compensatory mechanisms of variable amplification have to be employed for this purpose. The result is that the operation of the altimeter\nis obstructed.\nAll we had to do to achieve our goal was to select components of\nsuitable size for our apparatus.\nThe altimeter was based on the right angle lever principle described\nabove.\nHowever, because of the fairly considerable margin of error found\nin the present case, the design was slightly modified, as indicated in\nfigure 6.\nThe evacuated deformable bellows hinged to point F acts on A by\nmeans of the arm OA. Meanwhile, the other arm, OB, is pulled at by the\nspring, which is anchored at R.\n_ ^^\n\n^._-\t\n\nF\t\n\ni\n\nt\t\n\n;\t\n\xe2\x80\x94\n,I\xe2\x80\x9e ,9\t\n\nIi`\t\n\n,\t\n\n..-^"\t\n\n1 ^, \t\n\n_^\t\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2`\t\n^\n\nI \xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\n\' f\t\n\n^)\t\n\nI\t\n\nI1\t\n\n; \t\n\nn.\t\n\nV`\nWJ\n\n^i\n\n0^\n\n^I\'fi^^\' , Il^il1%\n\nO\t\n\n( \',IV\t\n\n^^\nh^^y >.l a: `t^^.^!\t\n\n6\t\nSchematic\t\nH.M.P.

Altimeter\n\nd) Construction and Testing of the Altimeter\nAs may be seen in figures 7 and 8, the parts of the altimeter upon\nwhich loads were exerted in the preceding studies are mounted entirely\non knife edges.\nIt is this fact that makes for the extraordinary barometric precision of this instrument, which will be indicated later on.\nBoth the knife edges themselves and their yokes have been made\nwith the same care as the knife edges in balance beam scales.\nAnother point that should not beoverlooked is that the amplification mechanism is made up of only one moving part between the lever\nand the needle. This is true despite the fact that the angular displacement is magnified 120 times.\nORIGINAL PAGE IS\nOF POOR QUALI N\'\t\n\n25\n\nThe total amplification that occurs between the elastic bellows\nand the point of the needle on the dial is approximately 2000. The\nbellows itself is only deformed by 0.12 mm.\nDuring the first experiments carried out on the altimeter, it\nwas equipped with only a paper dial whose 240 divisions were not\nexactly equidistant. The pressure in a - bell jar was measured by\na mercury manometer graduated in 1/2 millimeters. The manometer\ncould be read without difficulty to the nearest tenth of a millimeter,\nwhile the dial of the altimeter could only be used to measure the\npressure to the nearest fifth of a millimeter.\nWe obtained the following results, in the order given.

The\ncircuit is comprised of a 16 volt battery (B I ), two platinum wires\n(Fl and F 2 ) connected in parallel and 25 microns in diameter by.\n7 cm long,, a second, 18 V battery ( B2), and a variable resistor (R)\nthat has a value of around 40 ohms. A voltmeter ( V) is connected\nas indicated and the resistor is adjusted so that it reads zero. The\nsurrounding air pressure is held at 760 mm and the temperature at\napproximately 20\xc2\xb0 C.\nWe then placed the two hot wires in a vacuum chamber in which the\npressure is then lowered until it corresponds to an altitude of 14,000\nmeters.\nWe were thus able to obtain from numerous readings of the voltimeter the curve shown in figure 10. This curve shows that sensitivity\nof the device increases with increasing altitude and is approximately\n1.8 times greater at 14,000 meters than on the ground. The second\ncurve is that of pressure as a function of altitude. It can be seen\nthat the change in pressure for a given increase in altitude is about\n4.4 times smaller at 14 , 000 meters than at ground level. Therefore, if\na hot wire altimeter and a barograph are of the same sensitivity on the\nground, the altimeter will be 8 times more sensitive than the barograph\nat 14 , 000 meters.\n\n27\n\n/2,6 -\n\nV.

This thermometer is made of bimetallic plates of brass and invar. The plates are curved in\ncircular arcs, with the invar on the inside (figure 11). Because of\nthe difference in expansion between the two metals, the curvature of\nthe strip changes as the temperature varies. A needle is attached\nto the end of the strip and records the changes in curvature.\n\nin\n\nBi/ameb\nA< u//e a\n\nIR\n\n\t\nPigure 11\n\t\nTeisserenc de Bort\n\t\nThermometer\n\nFigure 12\nIdrac\nThermometer\n\nkey: a) needle\nb) bimetallic strip\nThe thermometer used to be hooked up to inscribe the temperature\non a cylinder simultaneously with a barometer made up of a Bourdon\ntube and a hygrometer made from a bundle of hair.\n\n28\n\nSuch an apparatus corresponds to what is now internationally\nknown as a meteorograph. Built very compactly, these instruments\nare used in atmospheric probes launched by balloon. Larger versions\nare installed in airplanes, for example in Germany, to study\nrising air currents.\nHergensell, who worked in Strasbourg before the war, created a\nthermometer based on slightly different principles. His thermometer\nincludes a metal column 20 cm long supported by three invar feet. The\ntip of the column works a system of amplifying levers.\nThe Idrac Thermometer\n\n\t\n\n27\n\nIdrac used a completely different kind of instrumei.t for measuring\ntemperature. It was built especially to register small temperature\nchanges occurring in a single region.\n\nThe thermometer is based on the manner in which the resistivity\noZ platinum changes with temperature.\nIt is composed of a spiral made of platinum wire a few hundredths\nof a millimeter thick whose total resistance is approximately 300 ohms.\nThe spiral is shielded from the rays of the sun by placing it in a\nblack tube open at both ends.\nIt is then attached to a kitu-, for example,_ and connected to the\nground by electric wires running along the kite string. The wires end\nat one of the arms of a Wheatstone bridge. The resistors on the Wheatstone bridge are adjusted so that at the beginning of the experiment the\ngalvanometer reads zero. A schematic drawing of the thermometer can be\nfound in figure 12.\nThe resistors in the bridge are made out of constantan and are\nindependent of temperature, As the temperature of the air around\nthe platinum wires changes, the reading of the galvanometer varies also.\nAfter preliminary calibration, this will allow the temperature to be\nevaluated.\nA galvanometer with a moving dial was constructed by Idrac especially for transport in the African bush. It had a fixed graduated\nscale read through a telescope aimed at a mirror reflecting the scale\'s\n.image. one had only to note the number lined up with the cross-hairs\nof the telescope to get a reading.\nThe thermometer was adjusted so that a small division on the scale\n(1/2 mm) was equivalent to a temperature change of 1/40 `C.\nThis type of apparatus was useful in studying temperature variations\naround the kite and also in an area where birds were soaring.\nVI. The Measurement of Air Density\n\nFrom the data furnished by a recording barometer and thermometer,\nthe density of the air can be deduced. However, if this method\nis to be accurate, the two instruments must respond rapidly\n29\n\nand equally to atmospheric changes. If not, the two values obtained\nat a given point will not correspond and an erroneous value for the\ndensity of the air will be derived.\nThe rating of the climbing performance of airplanes according to\nthe altitude attained is such an obvious absurdity that there is no\nneed to dwell on it very long.\nTo speak of altitude when pressure has been measured is first of\nnonsense. Altitude is not really determinable by any of the proall\ncedures currently employed for this purpose. In addition, the assumption of the equivalence at any point of standard and real atmospheres\nis in fact only a very rough approximation. This is demonstrated by all\nthe attempts to set altitude records, which irrefutable arguments\nhave shown to be filled with miscalculations resulting in figures more\nthan a kilometer off. (It is well known, of course, that competitors\nare quite talented in taking advantage of a large margin of error.)\nMoreover, it is well known that the atmospheric factor limiting\nthe ascent of an airplane is not at all the ambient pressure, which is\nthe only variable observable from the ground.\nOnly the record of the ambient density constitutes an approximate\nbasis for studying and rating high altitude performance.\nThe H.M.P. Bellows Oensigraph\n\nThese considerations are self-evident even if they might be\nconsidered revolutionary. They have motivated us to develop a recording densigraph based on the same principles as the altimeter that has\njust been described.\nHere too, the apparatus works by using a compensatory torque caused\nby atmospheric pressure. In this instrument the spring acting on the\nlever OB is maintained at a constant tension, i.e, it has a very great\nelasticity. On the other hand, the distance OB is made proportional to\nthe absolute temperature of the surrounding air by means of a rapid response thermometric device using linear metallic expansion. (See\nfigure 13.)\n/29\nThe drive torque is therefore proportional to the absolute tem- \t\nperature, while the compensatory torque is proportional to the atmospheric pressure p, and the angle of rotation e = hT/p = k/6, where 6\nis the density of the surrounding air. The sensitivity of the dens\ngraph increases with altitude, like the compensating bellows barograph.\n\nThe former only differs from the latter by the addition of a thermometric system. This system is composed of a series of thin walled\ntubes of graduated diameter. Each tube is enclosed in the next larger\none. The even numbered tubes are made of a metal such as aluminum which\nhas a large coefficient of expansion. The odd numbered tubes are made\nof a relatively low expansion metal, like invar.

The precision of measurements made at high\naltitude is increased by the same proportion, which is a very\nadvantageous feature when trying to measure an airplane\'s maximum\naltitude. This is exactly the function, so difficult for usual\nmethods, that this device was designed to fulfill.\n\nFigure 17 shows the curve of\nerror as a function of altitude.\nThis curve was drawn according to\npreviously \'calculated , values .\n\na\n\n1\nen b\nsi\n\nH.M.P.

A special, galvanometer is connected to the ends of the two wires. It is the use of this\nspecial galvanometer that has allowed us to avoid the compensatory\nbattery that was necessary for the hot wire altimeter circuit. At the\nsame time, the increased sensitivity at high altitudes, which was the\nprincipal advantage of the altimeter, has been preserved.\nThe galvanometer (figure 19) is made up of a double platinum\nwire held under tension by a bronze spiral supported by a spindle\nmounted on two pivots.\nAttached 40--o the spindle is the mirror needed to photographically /30\nrecord the meter readings. The lengthening of the wire caused by the\nheat produced by the current going through the galvanometer determines\nthe amount the mirror rotates.\n\n32\n\nIk\n\nA galvanometer of this kind is almost completely insensitive\nto any possible jolt that it could endure on board an airplane.\nDisturbing the galvanometer only causes harmless vibration of the\nwires.\nTests were carried out in the laboratory by placing the hot\nwire system in a more and more rarefied atmosphere. These\ntests have shown that the densigraph accurately reflected changes\nin the density of the air in the bell jar. Its sensitivity was\nobserved to increase as the air became more rarefied.\n\nIp7r\xe2\x80\xa2 ..\n\nFigure 18\t\nH.M.P. Hot Wire Densigraph\t\n\nFigure 19\nH.M.P. Thermal Galvanometer\n\nVII. The Measurement of Wind Speed\n\nThe atmosphere is not just a mass of immobile gas. As a result\nof the formation of centers of high and low pressure, caused by\nunequal rates of heating of the ground, displacements of masses of\nair occur. They take place either along the ground or from lower\nto higher altitudes. The former are called surface winds and the\nlatter are ascending thermal currents.\nThese winds have both an average speed and direction and\ninstantaneous ones. It is very important for aviation to be able to\ndetermine their values. Both the experimental study of aerodynamic\nphenomena and research into the principles of soaring cannot be\ncarried out without the knowledge of wind speed and direction.\nLangley in 1860 was the first person to prove that the wind\nwas not regular. For this purpose, he used an extremely light\nanemometer made with paper cones. The weight of these cones was only\nS grams, and their inertial moment was 300 gr/cm2.\nThe time needed for each half revolution was electrically\nrecorded and measured with the aid of an ordinary astronomical\nchronograph. The wind speed was derived from the interval, between\ntwo electrical contacts.\n33\n\nPitot Tube Anemometers\nSince then, many different instruments have been invented for\nmeasuring wind speed. We shall first of all describe the Pitot\ntube, which is based on Bernoulli\'s equation and is used for compressible gasses when variations in density and volume cannot be \t\nmeasured.\n\n/31\n\nGiven the wind speed v and the air density p, Bernoulli\'s\nequation gives the value of the static pressure pt\np+pv2=C\nwhere C is .constant.\nFurthermore, if P is the total pressure at a stagnant point\nin a body of air in movement, one has:\nP - p\nIf P and p are known, v can be calculated from the formula:\nv = 32P - p p\n\nII\nFigure 20\t\nPitot Tubes\t\n\nFigure 21\nDouble Pitot Tube with\nDifferential Manometer\n\nIn order to find the static pressure p, the pressure on one\t\npoint of a surface placed in a fluid is measured. To do this, a\ntube curved at one end is used. At the end of the curve is a\nconical section that is pointed against the direction of the fluid\nflow and which contains an orifice 0 on its side (figure 20). The\nspeed near the hole should be that of the general fluid flow.\nIf an identical tube is used, but with the orifice at the tip\nof the conical section (figure 20), the hole O faces a wind\nperpendicular to its surface. Since the speed at the orifice is zero,\nthe total pressure P can be measured.\nBy using the two so-called Pitot tubes one after the other, P\nand p can be obtained and v calculated from their values. It has\n\n34\n\n.\n\nbeen found more convenient to join these two tubes together to make\na differential manometer out of them. The difference P - p = h\nis thus directly obtained. (See figure 21.)\nIn reality, since Bernoulli\'s equation assumes that the fluid\nis perfect and incompressible, v can never be obtained directly.\nIt is necessary that each Pitot tube be calibrated beforehand with an\napparatus that measures wind speed.\nVenturi Tube Anemometers\nMuch more accurate measurements of wind speed are obtained by\nusing Venturi tubes.\nWhen a liquid is moving through a pipe or nozzle, the pressure\non the walls in general decreases as the speed increases. According\nto the study that Bernoulli made on this question, the pressure at\na given point will diminish as the effective speed becomes greater.\nThis pressure is equal to the hydrostatic pressure H less the height. \t\nH\' of a column of the liquid which would flow out at the speed\noccurring at the chosen point.\n\n/32\n\nIf the actual speed is greater than\nthan the theoretical speed, as occurs in\nnozzles, H - H\' is negative and the fluid\nseparates: from the walls.\nVenturi verified this theory by\nconnecting one end of a U tube with a nozzle\nwhile submerging the other end in water.\nHe observed that the liquid rose in the\ntube (figure 22). This proves that the\npressure was smaller in the nozzle than in\nthe exterior air.\nFigure 22\nDevice for\nStudying the\nPressure\nIn a Nozzle\n\nSeveral physicists have attempted to\nuse this principle to construct anemometers.\nSuch devices are based on the mechanics of\n"Venturi" tubes.\nORIGINAL PAGE IS\nOF POOR QUALITY\n\na) The Dines Anemometer\n\nA Venturi tube is composed of two truncated cones joined\ntogether at their smaller ends and whose larger ends have approximately\nthe same area. The tube through which the air enters is one third\nas long as the tube by which it leaves. (See figure 23.) As soon\nas a fluid in movement traverses the Venturi tube, it produces a\npartial vacuum in the narrow part (throat) of the tube. This vacuum\ncan be measured with a manometer. The difference in average pressure\nbetween the entrance to the tube and the throat gives the value of V.\nIt is upon this principle that Dines based the design of his anemometer.\n\n35\n\nHe used the vertical displacement of a double bell jar to determine\nthe difference in pressure.\n\nV,\nv^\n\n\t\nFigure 23\n\t\nA Simple Venturi Tube\n\nFigure 24\nA Double Venturi Tube\nwith Manometer\n\nb) The Bourdon Anemometer\nIn order to obtain increased sensitivity, Bourdon placed a\nsmall Venturi tube inside a large one (figure 24). This was done\nin such a manner that the exhaust of the smaller tube was located in\nthe throat of the larger one. As a result of the reduction in\npressure in the throat of the larger tube, the speed of the air\ncurrent in the smaller Venturi tube is increased. This causes a\ngreater vacuum in its neck.\nVery large pressure reductions are produced by this system.\nThe amplification in the smaller tube can thus be increased to 20.\nc) The H.M.P. Anemometer\nHuguenard, Planiol, and I have built a recording apparatus\nthat measures the vacuum created inside a Venturi tube and,\ntherefore, the speed of an air current. This device consists of\na metal manometer of the sort that we have used in our accelerographs, only much more sensitive. (See figure 25_.) The manometer,\nequipped with a very light pen, has an intrinsic period of 1/40 second.\nThe response curve of the manometer was plotted at the large\nwind tunnel in Issy-les-Moulineaux. A small tube connected the\nVenturi tube to the manometer. A mercury manometer measured\nthe pressure within the Venturi tube at the same time our device\ndid.\nCup Anemometers\t\nA windmill or a propellor placed in a wind of speed V so that\nits axis of rotation is parallel with the wind takes on a certain\nspeed of rotation if friction is negligible. The number of turns n\n\n36\n\n/33\n\nvaries with V and, from the value of n, V can thus be deduced.\n\nJ\n\t\n\nlv\n\n\t\nFigure 25 \t\nFlexible Plate \t\nH.M.P. Manometer\n\nFigure 26\nCup Type\nAnemometer\n\nCertain anemometers, such as the Richard and Robinson models, are\nbased on this principle. They consist of a small rotor (figure 26)\nturning in a vertical plane and oriented by a weather vane to face\n\nthe wind.\n\na) The Magnan_Anemometer\n\nI myself used to use a cup anemometer that was directly linked to\na magneto. The magneto\'s armature was mounted on bearings and the\nrotor was mounted on top of it.\nThe current produced by the magneto was read by a protable\nvoltmeter of large size and resistance which had three different\nranges. The voltmeter caused a light aluminum pen to deflect. In\nthis manner the curves were recorded in ink on a cylindrical\nrecorder: or in a modified fluxmeter.

The curves\nplotted were greatly distorted. The rotors did not begin to\nturn until the wind was about 2 meters because of excessive friction.\nIn addition, in calm air they needed 2 seconds to stop if their\ninitial speed corresponded to 5 m/sec. They slowed down under the\ncombined effect of friction and the resistance torque. However, this\neffect was partly offset by their considerable moments of inertia.\nThe result was that although the times recorded between gusts\nwere fairly close to reality, the amplitudes of the variations were\nmuch smaller than they should have been.\nThe ^alibration curves of these instruments (figure 28) show\nthe inadequacy of such instruments for weak winds. on the other\nhand, the curves also show that the scale is a linear function of\nwind speed as soon as the rotors have begun moving.\nb) H.M.P. Oscillating Blade Anemometer\nHuguenard, Planiol, and I have developed an anemometer that\nworks by measuring the speed of rotation of a shaft. The shaft\nopens and closes an electric contact which allows a constant amount\nof electricity to pass into the recording circuit at each closing.\nThe net result is that the average current in the circuit is proportional to the number of times the contact is closed by the shaft in\na unit time period.\nB\nF^\n\nC\nt\n\nso\n\n4\n\nE\nO\n\ni^\n\nV\nV\'\n\nl i ct\nV^\n\nS\n\n,Q\n\nZO\n\n4\n^0\t\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nr4raar dv ienL j\n\n\t\nFigure 29\n\t\nH.M.P.

After each movement of the shaft, the blade oscillates\na predetermined number of times (once, for example) to close the\ncircuit by hitting the contact.\nAs shown in figure 29, the blade L is in contact with the contact\nscrew V when at rest and connects the capacitor C with the battery B.\nThe blade, when deflected by the cam C (moved by haft A), comes into\ncontact with the contact screw V1,to which is connected a galvanometer\nand one of the wires leading to the capacitor C2.\n\nIn its restit.y position, the blade charges up the capacitor Cl\nby connecting it with the source of electricity. The cam, which\nturns in the direction of the arrow, hits the blade and forces it into contact with Vl , thus causing the capacitor to discharge into\nthe galvanometer.\nAfter the cam moves away, the blade returns to its resting\nposition against V.\nThe series of impulses, averaged out by C, received by the galvanometer causes it to be permanently deflected. Figure 30 shows the\nresponse curve obtained in a small wind.tunnel and allows the\nprecision of the measurement$ to be judged.\nThe H.M.P.

They offer\nthe advantage of only inserting into the wind a very small structure\nwhich does not obstruct it,\nA hot wire anemometer (figure 31) is composed of a platinum wire\nF. a battery Hl providing the current to heat the wire, and an\nammeter G with a shunt S to measure the current. When the wind\nblows over the wire, which has been heated so that it is red hot,\nit cools it down. This causes the current to increase.\n\nFigure 32 represents the current variation in the wire. It \t\nproves that such an anemometer\'s sensitivity becomes so low that\nit is unusuable at speeds of more than 5 m/sec.\n\nL36\n\n0000 0o U\xc2\xa9\n\n^\t\n\nV\n\nEff\n\nt..\t\n\nA\n\nGv\nFigure 34\nAnemometer Wire\nwith Support\n\nFigure 35\nControl Panel\nfor Hot Wire\nAnemometer\n\nIn order to alleviate this problem, we added, as is shown in\nthe,dotted part of figure 31, a compensatory battery B 2 and a\nresistor R which is adjusted so as to reduce the current in the\nshunt to zero when there is no wind. In addition, the shunt does\nnot have a constant resistance but is constructed of a fine wire\nsheltered from the wind whose resistance increases considerably as\nthe current going through it grows. With these modifications, the\nreadings obtained from the anemometer are practically proportional\nto the wind speed. (See figure 33).\nIn the anemometer that we built for the Service Technique de\nl\'Adronautique, the hot wire is mounted in a support at the end of\na tube (figure 34) and linked by wires to a control panel (figure 35)\t\ncontaining the instruments used for adjusting the equipment.

We then recorded the image of the wire\nset vibratin g\non sensitive film with the aid of a lens. Despite the small variation \t\nin speed caused by the sound waves and the fairly high frequency, the\nwire underwent great variations in temperature that were easily noticewire\n/37\non the film and allowed the period of vibration to be directly \t\nmeasured.\n\n41\nImp I\n\nI\n\nWe then connected the hot wire to an anemometer circuit in\nthe same pipe and used the oscillograph to trace the results. Even\nthe irregularities in the vibrational cycle of the air in the pipe\nwere clearly plotted.\nThe hot wire anemometer that we developed yields relative\nmeasures and has to be calibrated with the aid of absolute\n\nanemometers. Until now we have had to be content with calibrations\nmade in the small wind tunnel that we put together and in the Eiffel\nand Issy-les-Moulineaux tunnels. The different speeds were determined first by Ptot or Venturi tubes.\nVIII. The Measurement of Wind Direction\nLilienthal was the first person to wonder whether the wind\nwas really horizontal across the surface of a flat area.\nLilienthal Weather Vane\nTo answer this question, Lilienthal used vertical recording\nvanes (figure 39) made of a horizontal arm turning on a tripod. At\none end of the arm was a curved surface and at the other was a\ncounterweight. An alternative arrangement had five parallel\nhorizontal arms linked together with a flat surface at one end and a\ncounterweight at the other.,, Lilienthal was thus able to obtain the\nfirst diagrams of vertical wind direction and to record its variations. He noticed a continual variation in the vertical component of the\nwind and an average ascendance of 3 degrees at the location of his\nequipment.\nThe Constantin-Idrac Weather Vane\nIdrac used a similar piece of equipment, a weather vane\ndesigned by Constantin. This ingenious device was made of two\nwing sections from an airplane placed backwards and connected together.\nThe pressure exerted by a horizontal air current created an equilibrium position. The least variation in the horizontality of the wind\nproduced a considerable difference in wind pressure, which caused\nthe wing sections to find a new equilibrium by rotatiiq around their\naxis. Since the forces\'brought into play were considerable, the\nmovement could be amplified by a system of quadrilateral;, and transmitted electrically as far as desired. A series of small numbered\nlamps corresponding to electrical contacts in the circuits enabled\nan observer to read the inclination of the wind from a distance.\nHowever, this apparatus could not detect rapid variations in\n\ninclination because of its inertia.\n\n42\n\ntars\nH.M.P.

Directional Indicator\n\nI have already said that for the study of the wind, it is necessary\nto know the instantaneous direction of the wind in addition to its speed.\nConsequently, an apparatus that indicates wind direction with the same\nlag time as the speed indicator in use is required. We decided to use\nhot wires also to record the fluctuations in air current and we then\nconstructed a simple directional indicator by placing two identical loot\nwires equidistant and parallel to the axis of a cylinder. (See Pl and\nF2 in figure 40.) The two wires constitute two branches of a Wheatstone\nbridge (figure 41) which is completed by two resistors of approximately\nthe same resistance as the hot wires and an ammeter or galvanometer G. \t/3\xc2\xab\nA battery B maintains a constant voltage across the \'bridge. The bridge\nis balanced in calm air, and the wires heated to 1,200 0 . If the wind\nblows in a direction parallel tolhe plane of symmetry of the instrument,\nthe two wires are equally cooled and the current through each one is\nstill equal. The galvanometer continues to read zero. If the wind\nblows from the right, one of the wires is cooled more than the other.\nThe current is then greater on one side and the needle of the galvanometer moves. This is how the inequality of current due to variations\nin resistance in the two hot wires can be used to measure the inclination\nof the wind relative to the axis of the apparatus.\nFigure 42 depicts the cylinder on which the two hot wires are\nmounted. The wires are connected to the control panel in figure 43,\nwhich contains the variable resistors, the ammeters, and a zero-center\nscale milliampmeter.\n\n43\n\nap\n\n\xc2\xae\xc2\xae 0 0 0\n\n^\t\n\nL\t\n\nEE3\n\nA^\n\n^7\n(100\nAz,\ntl ^i+])1^! 1^\n\ni1,\n\nFigure 42\nDouble Hot Wire\n\nDirectional Indicator\n\nFigure 43\nControl Panel of\nDirectional Indicator\n\nWhat would happen if the speed of the wind changed while the\ndirection remained constant? Experience has shown that, contrary\nto what one might think,the deviation is more or less independent\nof wind speed within the range studied. The first tests were made\nin our own small wind tunnel at speeds up to 20 m/sec. The operation\nof the directional indicator was found to be reliable up to this\nlimit. Later, in the large wind tunnel at Issy, the current was\nobserved to be practically constant from 0 to 45 m/sec.\nIX. The Measurement of the Acceleration and Angular Velocity of\n\nthe Win d\n\nTo use the results obtained from, the study of natural winds in\nthe calculation of the trajectory of a glider or a bird, more\ncomplete data for the speed, direction, and inclination of the wind\nare needed. The time derivatives of these variables must also be\nknown.\nIn order to analyze mathematically the problem of variable\nsurface winds heading i y`;. a constant direction, we had to construct\nan apparatus that could .automatically trace the acceleration curve\nfrom a given anemometric plot. Figure 44 shows one of these\nderived curves from an electromagnetic anemometer and another\nobtained simultaneously with a hot wire device placed in the same\nlocation. The accelerations obtained from the hot wire anemometer\nare much greater and go as high as 10 m/sec . Since it is these\n\n44\n\nI-\n\naccelerations that provide the support for a glider and also cause\nadded stress to the frame of an airplane, there is a great deal of\ninterest in finding means of measuring them.\n\nFigure 44b\nFigure 44a\t\nAbove: Instantaneous velocity\nAbove: Instantaneous veloc-\t\nity of a wind N recorded with of the same wind N recorded with\nan electromagnetic anemometer\t\na hot wire anemometer\nBelow: Acceleration curve\nBelow: Acceleration curve\t\nH.M.P. Converters\n\nWe have constructed devices that we call converters and that\nsimultaneously record the,amperage of a variable current and its\ntime derivative. They are based on the following principles:\nA hot wire apparatus produces a current i whose voltage is\nproportional to the parameter being measured: speed V, inclination\na, or direction S of the wind. The movement of a galvanometer (1)\nis therefore placed in a*magnetic field (figure 45). This galvanometer gives the value of i or a as a function of time. One way\nthis can be done is to record the angular displacement of the movement on a moving photographic film with the aid of a light. A\nsecond galvanometric movement (2) is rigidly attached to the first\nand placed in the same magnetic field. An electromagnetic force is\ninduced in it proportional to d.i/dt or de/dt because of its angular\nmotion proportional to changes in i or e.\nFinally, a third movement is placed in another magnetic field\nand measures the current produced by the induced voltage in number\n2. It does this in an isolated circuit where the resistance is the\nonly factor that needs to be considered. The effect of the small\nmovement on the large one is negligible in the present experimental\nset-up.\n\n40\n\n1\t\n\n\', rs\n(\t\n\nLI\n\n\t\nel\n\nJiw ^^^.\n4^^\n\ni\nFigure 45\nSchematic Diagram\nH.M.P. Converter\n\nFigure 46\nH.M.P. Converter\n\nThe instrument is thus composed of two electromagnets, a large\none and a small one. Within the gap between the poles of each of the\ntwo magnets are three galvanometric movements, large ones in the larger\nmagnet, and small ones in the smaller magnet. (see figure 46.)\nThe large electromagnet consumes about 25 watts of power and\ncreates a 4,500 gauss field. The smaller one consumes 12 watts and\nproduces a 5,000 gauss field.\nThe bigger magnet holds three doubl y\' movements. One is used\nto measure wind speed the second is for inclination, and the third\nmeasures direction. The resistance of the windings is 1 ohm for all\nthe number 2 movements, 30 ohms for the number 1 movements thatindicate direction, and 250 ohms for movement 1 of the wind speed indicator.\nThe small movements are all of 1 ohm resistance.\n\n46\n.\n\nRECOMMENDED READING\nDaguin, Traite de physique [Treatise on Physics), Delagrave,\nParis\nHergesell (see Linke), Meteorologische Ausbildung des Flie2ers,\nBerlin, 1917.\nHuguenard, Magnan, P1ani.ol, "Sur un appareil. a fil chaud a\ncompensation" [A Compensated Hot Wire Instrument], C.R.A.S.,\nJanuary 29, 1923.\nHuguenard, Magnan, Planiol, "Sur un appareil donnant la direction\ninstantande du vent" [An Instrument that Measures the Instantaneous Direction of the Wind), C.R.A.S., March 5, 1923.\nHuguenard, Magnan, Planiol, Sur une methode de mesure de la vitesse\net de la direction instantanee u vent A Method ox Measuring\nthe Instantaneous Speed and Direction of the Wind), Roche\nd\'Estrez, Paris, 1924.\nHuguenard, Magnan, Planiol, "Sur un principe permettant la\nrealisation d\'apparels mesur.ant les conditions aerodynamiques du\nvol des avions" [The Principles Involved in Building Instruments\nfor Measuring Aerodynamic Conditons of Airplane Flight], C.R.A.S.,\nNovember 14, 1927.\nHuguenard, Magnan, Planiol,\'Recherches expeximentales sur les\nconditions de vol des oiseaux et des avion.4\' [Experimental\nResearch on the Principles of Bird and Airplane Flight], Technivue aeronautique, 1926.\nIdrac, Recherchss experimentales sur le vol a voile [Experimental\nResearch on Soaring], Paris, 1922.\nIdrac, "Contribution a l\'etude des vents du large."

Today I am going to describe\nfor you the results that we have obtained and give a picture of the\ngeneral structure of the atmosphere and of surface air currents.\nOur planet is surrounded by an enormous ocean of air which goes\nup to a considerable height. As the real ocean is the atmosphere for\nfish, the actual atmosphere is our ocean, as it is for birds. It is\nthe medium in which we move, sometimes like crabs walking along the\nbottom, sometimes, when we imitate the birds and fly, like fish in the\nsea.\nJust as sailors :need to know the behavior of the ocean both on\nthe surface and in its depths, so it is in the interest of aviators\nto understand the activity that goes on in the ocean of air. Professor\nFabry, in a very interesting lecture, has described the state of our\nknowledge on this subject. I could not do better than to summarize\nwhat he said, particularly as concerns the upper atmosphere. As I have\nalready mentioned, the quantity of air which surrounds the earth, if\nit was all at standard atmospheric pressure, would only have a thickness of 8,000 meters and would not reach the highest peaks of the Himalayas. If the temperature of the air were suddenly reduced to -200\xc2\xb0 C,\nthe air would condense into a liquid ocean only ten meters deep.\nFor the time being, this has not occurred, and experimental studies\nhave shown that in fact the atmosphere extends well beyond the highest\nmountains.\nI. The Structure of the Lower Atmosphere\n\nWe have several means available to study the lower atmosphere. We\ncan, it is true, carry our instruments up to the tops of the highest\nmountains. The method is practical up to a certain altitud^R, but becomes very strenuous higher up. Fortunately, other, more convenient\nmays exist. These are:\n-the balloon\n-and the airplane,\nwhich currently allow researchers to make use of heavy instruments up to\na maximum of 12,000 meters. There are two reasons for this limit. In\nthe first place, 12,000 meters is the highest altitude balloons and airplanes can attain at present. Secondly, the human body cannot function\nat altitudes higher than this.\nThere is also the sounding balloon which is capable of carrying \t\napparatus to 30,000 meters above sea level, although the scientist has\nto remain on the ground. Its lifting force is small and only very\nlight pieces of equipment can be attached to it. Not only is lighter\nequipment more delicate than normal apparatus, but precision sometimes\nsuffers when it is used.\n\n48\n\n/42\n\n\t\n\nA sounding balloon is a spherical, balloon made of a thin\nsheet of very elastic rubber inflated with hydrogen. Its diameter\nbefore takeoff is from 0.75 to 2 meters. In a small basket it\ncontains a light instrument for recording pressure, temperature,\nand humidity. The weight of this weather station is only a few\nhundred grams.\nThe balloon expands while rising. Its walls grow thinner\nand eventually burst. The maximum attainLole altitude before\nbursting is usually around _20 km. However, sometimes 30 km. is\nreached. The small basket releases a parachute as it falls and lands\non the ground gently enough not to break the weather station within.\nSounding balloons were introduced by Teisserenc de Bort. They\nwere perfected by Hergesell in Germany, Rotch in the United States,\nand Gamba in Italy. Such probes are now made quite regularly. The\nTrappes observatory in France directed by Idrac is particularly\nactive in this field.\nReduction of Pressure with Increasing Altitude\nThe observations that have already been carried out, although\nsometimes of questionable accuracy, have built up a body of data\nconcerning the composition of the atmosphere at high altitude.\nFirst of all, it is known that atmospheric pressure decreases\nwith increasing height. At 5.5 km the pressure is half that at sea\nlevel. If one goes up to 18.4 km, the pressure is only a tenth\nof that on the ground. Figure 47a reTiresents the change in air pressure under standard conditions as a function of altitude, according\nto the Service\t Technique d \t l\'Ad\t ronauique.\nT h\t\nt\n15000\n\n12 50(\n\n1000(\n\n1\'z\n\nd r.\n7500\n\n$ 00o\n\n-\n\n_.._\n\n\xe2\x80\x94_\n\n_\n\n^-. ._\n\n1\'r..Put2nN\xe2\x80\xa20n0c^z) ^:rs\n\nDe Oa1100^ ^\t\n\n2500\nDe 11 DO a 201011\n\n268\ndZ.111/, 266\xe2\x80\xa2D,oD65a.} \xe2\x80\xa2.255\n206\n\nIay,Pzslog PI1 _ Z-tt000\n14600\n11 log 41z.1og A 11 _ z -u 000\n4600\n\n9\nOenrile 1,2\n\nd\n\n..1\t\n\nLV\t\n\nV.y\t\n\nu./\t\n\nu.V\n\nXex\'Voa 760 700\t\n\n600\n\nV,(\'\t\n\nV.\'\t\n\nV.4\t\n\nU,J\t\n\nU.L\t\n\nU.)\n\nS00\t\n\n400\t\n\n300\t\n\n200\t\n\n100\n\nFigure 47a\nDecrease in Pressure Pz and Density dz with Increasing Altitude\nKey: a) From 0 to 11,000 b) From 11,000 t0 20, 000 e) pressure d) density\n\n49\n\nE__;\n\n15 000\n14 000\n13 unu\n\n120(91\n\n11W\ne0 (VJO\n\nyaw\n8000\n7 OU0\nb U10\n\n5 ON)\nt fl(K1\n3 0UU\n\n20M\n1000\n0\t\n+15\t\n\n#10\t\n\n+5\t\n\ntT\t\n\n,.5\t\n\n_10\t\n\n..15\t\n\n.20\t\n\n_2S\t\n\n- \'1C\t\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2.c\t\n\nto\t\n\n_.L%t)\t\n\n_5S\n\nFigure 47b\nDecrease in Temperature with Increasing Altitude\nReduction in Temperature with Increasing Altitude\nUp to 10,000 meters, temperature\nalso decreases with altitude.

This is in contrast to the birds,\nwho are concerned with diminished pressure.\nSamples taken up to 15 km have shown that at least the composition\nof the air is constant. To take air samples, an evacuated glass bottle\nwhose end has been drawn out is placed in the basket of a balloon. When\nthe balloon bursts, a device breaks the drawn out end and rarefied air\nenters. Another device then seals the end up again.\nII. The Structure of the Upper Atmosphere\nEven though we cannot reach altitudes above 15 or 20 km with\noundings, we can still find out something about the character of\nt\xe2\x96\xba\nthe upper atmosphere. The methods used to do this are very ingenious.\nFabry has described them exceedingly well.\nThe Ozone Layer\nFirst of all, there is the study of the absorption of light\nwaves as they traverse the atmosphere. We have already received\nsome valuable information from this line of research.\nTake the light that comes from a star. By the time it arrives on\nthe ground, it has been filtered by the atmosphere. The nature of this\nfiltration reveals some of the properties of our gaseous ocean. From\nthe moment when the light coming from stars was first analyzed, it was\nnoticed that the atmosphere absorbed some of the light waves, particularly in the ultraviolet. The explanation of ultraviolet absorption\nby the presence of ozone in the atmosphere came very quickly thereafter.\nThe actual amount of ozone, if it were purified and at _atmospheric\npressure, would only make up a layer three millimeters thick. However,\nits importance to us is considerable since it protects us fromthe\nharmful effects of ultraviolet radiation. The ozone layer is not immediately around us, but is found at an altitude of 40 to 50 km, which is\nmuch higher than a sounding balloon can go. There are also seasonal\nvariations inthe ozone layer. In the northern hemisphere, much ozone\nis observed in the spring and only a little in the autumn. Just the\nopposite is found in the southern hemisphere. Thus, a cyclonic atmospheric flow increases the quantity of ozone, and an anticyclonic flow\ndiminishes it. This proves that, contrary to what has been claimed,\nthe troposphere and the stratosphere do not form two independent zones.\nThe Temperature 60 Km Up\nAnother method of studying the upper atmosphere consists of\nanalyzing reflected sound waves. It was noticed during the war\n\n51\n\nthat at certain spots one could hear a cannon fire whereas at other\nlocations closer to the cannon it could not be heard. In studying\nthose "zones of silence", it was noticed that the upper atmosphere\nplayed an important role because of the way in which the speed of\nsound varied with altitude. The variation occurs because the atmosphere becomes hot again at very high altitude. At high altitude the\ntemperature reaches 30\xc2\xb0 C and the speed of propagation of sound in\nwarm air is not the same as in cold air. Thus, it is basically warm\nat ground level, very cold at 10 km, and hot at 80 or 100 km. It is\nthought that this is the result of the presence of ozone at these\naltitudes. The ozone is supposed to warm up the air by absorbing\nultraviolet waves.\n\n1\n4\n\n/45\n\nIs There a Layer of Hydrogen above 60 Km?\n\nAnother phenomenon that helps us to deduce the aroperties of the\nupper atmosphere is the behavior of the shooting stars that come to us\nfrom the depths of space with the speed of comets. The spectrum emitted\nby a shooting star at the moment when it first lights up is not that of\nan incandescent solid body, but that of a gas, namely hydrogen.\nThe shooting star is therefore not itself luminous. It is the\nsurrounding environment that lights up.\nShooting stars first become visible at around 100 km in altitude.\nThey disappear around 60 km. There is thus some basis for wondering\nif a region of high concentration of hydrogen exists in the upper atmosphere, although some people reject this possibility.\nThere is Still Some Air at an Altitude of 700 Km.\nFinally the aurora borealis of the polar regions furnishes us\nwith some interesting data. It is a luminosity of the upper gaseous\nlayers resulting from bombardment by electrical charges thrown off by\nthe sun. Its spectrum is that of oxygen. Usually the aurora borealis\nhas an altitude of 100 km, but sometimes it exists at 700 km. Even at\nthis high an altitude there must still be some air.\nFigure 49 summarizes our current knowledge of the constitution of\nthe earth\'s atmosphere.\nThe relation between pressure and altitude will be much better\nunderstood by examining figure 50, on which has been marked the altitudes attained by various human and natural creations.\nThe importance of pushing forward in the study of the atmosphere\nshould be obvious at the present time. Already there is talk of flying at high altitudes in order to reach speeds of 1,000 km per hour to\nfacilitate intercontinental comlunications. The possibility of interplanetary travel has even been seriously raised. Aeronautics, which\ndid not exist a few decades ago, is thus now witnessing the birth of\na competitor, astronautics.\n\n52\n\n/46\n\nI\n\nb\n\n132000\n\nIo..e o\'tr\n^ror+rtpo/rvnr\n\n9! 000\nt "\n\n1~AV c\n\n,2.4\n\ntia/rr//Aw r\n\n\xe2\x99\xa6 30\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nd\n\n66 000\n\nColche dorms\ne\n\no^ ...o _....o ^P\n\nfl VIM sonde\n\n50\n\nC,noo dr^lAo\n\ni^\nh\t\n\n30\n20\n\nFigure 49\nSummary of our\nKnowledge of\nthe Constitution\nof the Atmosphere\n(o = ozone)\nKey: a) Shooting stars\nb) Aurora borealis zone\nc) Shooting star zone\n\n^v^\n\nN"/Ama4sy.^\nMillr^iir\n\n33 000\n\no\n\ns f\n11000\n$ 500\n\nFigure 50\nPressure-Altitude Curve\nwith Indication of\nthe Altitude of\nVarious Vehicles and\nNatural phenomena\nd) Ozone Layer\ne) Cannon Bertha sounding balloon\nf) Airplanes\ng) Himalaya Mountains\n\nIII. Horizontal Winds\nUntil we are able to propel ourselves to the surface of our\natmospheric ocean, let us study the lower levels, which could be\ncalled the ocean floor. This is the only part that affects us\ndirectly, since it is only\t\nthe lower regions through which we\ncan transport ourselves at the present time. The higher reaches are\nstill forbidden to us.\nIt is customary in aerodynamic studies to represent the movement\nof the air in such a way that each particle follows a regular, straight\npath parallel to that of its neighbors. However, in the atmosphere,\nparticles of air move in a completely different manner. Their\ntrajectories describe vortices and curves. They ascend and descend,\nusuall y in a forward direction, although sometimes backwards, sometimes quickly, sometimes slowly.\n\nOF POOR !)ETA:` 17 1\'\n\n53\n\n10\xc2\xab\n\nQ\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nFigure 51\nTwo Recordings of the Instantaneous Speed of the Same Wind N\nLeft: with a Hot Wire Anemometer\nRight: with an Electromagnetic Anemometer\n(l second = 5.4 mm)\n\n1 Secatio\n\n5ms\n\t\n\n.^....\n\n0\n\nFigure 52\nInstantaneous Speed of an ESE Wind Recorded by a Hot Wire Anemometer\nThe Germans have pointed out that winds of less than 4 m/sec are\nlaminar.\nThis means that such winds have a configuration that is constant\nover a certain period of time. The needle of a galvanometer used to\nrecord wind speed and direction will therefore trace, a straight line\non the recording cylinder. Such tracings are indeed obtained if an\nelectromagnetic anemometer is employed. However, it can be observed\nwith the aid of more sensitive hot wire anemometers that very rapid\noscillations of speed and direction occur in weak winds. The curves\ntraced by the same galvanometers are then more or less undulated, with\nthe needle going sometimes above and sometimes below the average line.\nOn the left side of figure 51 is found the tracing produced by a\nhot wire anemometer on a cylinder that makes a complete revolution\nevery 26 seconds. The average speed of the wind, recorded on the\nCrau plain, is approximately 10 m/sec, On the right side is a tracing /47\nthat was made on the same cylinder by an electromagnetic anemometer\nsituated right next to the other one. The first curve, obtained with\nthe hot wire, shows rapid fluctuations of speed 3 to 5 times pet\nsecond. The second curve, although it furnishes useful informaton\nfor some purposes, only indicates oscillations whose period lasts more\nthan a second.\nFigure 52 is a recording on the instantaneous speed of a wind\naveraging 2 m/sec observed on the beach at Le Havre with a hot wire\nanemometer. It reveals, thanks to the sensitivity of the\n\n54\n\ninstrument, that rapid oscillations exist,even though the wind has a\nspeed of less than 4 m/sec.\nVariations in the Speed of the Wind.\nThe study of the wind rapidly reveals that variations in wind\nspeed are different indifferent situations.\nFrom the recordings that I have made above the sea, on the ground,\non mountains, and in the desert, the first thing I noticed was that in\nthe vicinity of the earth\'s surface, the wind has one constant property:\nirregularity.\n\n1 minute\nFigure 53\nRecording of the Instantaneous Speed of a Sea Breeze\nShowing Atmospheric Waves (Solid Vertical Lines),\nGusts (Dashed Lines), and Pulsations (Dotted Lines)\nIn the lower layers of the atmosphere, the wind never has a\nconstant speed. It always shows momentary variations of speed and is\nlike a series of rapid oscillations or gusts. It also seems that the\namplitude of the oscillations is highly_ variable. It probably has\nsomething to do with the topography of the region over which the wind\nis blowing.\n\nI have been able to demonstrate that, at least up to 100 meters\nabove the ground, the wind undergoes a type of oscillation whose\naverage duration is approximately one minute (figure 53).\nI have given the name atmospheric waves to these slow oscillations.\nEach wave in its turn is made up of shorter oscillations whose duration\nvaries between 8 and 20 seconds, very often being around 15 seconds long.\nI call the shorter oscillations gusts. I have observed that the\nvariations in wind speed occurring in gusts that pass over very uneven\nground easily attain several meters per second. Sometimes at the end\nof a gust, wind speed drops down almost to zero and then quickly increases to 10; 12, or even 15 meters per second.\nThe difference between the maximum and minimum speed of strong\nwinds varies a great deal. It is always at least 3 or 4 meters per\n\n55\n\nsecond, and sometimes goes as high as 15 meters per second. For\nweaker winds, the amplitude of the oscillation is smaller. It thus\nappears that the size of the momentary variations in wind speed increases as the average wind speed increases. Horizontal winds also\ncontain even smaller oscillations than gusts. I called these minute\nfluctuations pulsations. They are variable in number, sometimes 5 to\n7 per second. The stronger the wind is, the more rapid the fluctuations are.\nThe winds of the open sea are more regular than those that cross\nthe land. I have observed through the use of recordings that the\ngusts of a sea breeze have a smaller amplitude than land breezes. A\nwind in the ocean whose average speed is 1145 m/sec will in general\nhave a maximum speed not much greater than 13.5 m/sec and a minimum\nspeed fluctuating between 9 and 10 m/sec. However,this does not\nalways hold true and I have encountered sea breezes with much greater\noscillations. It is very rare, though, that winds in the open sea show\nsudden decreases in speed, as occurs on land.\n\n1 0 ins\n\nt ^.\n\n^\t\n\nf\n\n0\nFigure 54\nSpeed of a Wind in the Crau Plain\nRecorded with a Hot Wire Anemometer\n( 1 min. = 4.7 cm)\nIn ms\n\n0\n\nFigure 55\nSpeed of a Wind on the Summit of Mont Ventoux\nRecorded with a Hot Wire Anemometer\nU min. = 4.7 cm)\n56\n\n49\n\n-\t\n\n^\xe2\x80\x94 --.^\t\n\n10 rms\t\n\n---^.-\xe2\x80\x94-------\n\nFigure 56\nSpeed of a SSW Sea Breeze in Brittany\nRecorded with a Hot Wire Anemometer\n(1 min. - 4.7 cm)\n\nAn examination of the tracings reveals in addition that generally\nthe period of increasing speed in a sea gust is practically equal to\nthe period of reducing speed. This is contrary to what occurs on land.\nOften gusts of sea breezes have sudden reversals and decrease speed for\n1 1 2, or 3 seconds only to increase speed anew. One or two such reversals are frequently found in a gust. Sometimes there are as many as\n\nfour or five.\n\nIt also seems that the character of the wind changes, as much on\nthe sea as on land, according to the direction in which it is blowing.\nOnly repeated experiments can reveal the reasons for this change.\n\n/49\n\nFigures 54, 55, and 56 provide some examples. They reproduce\ntracings of wind speed obtained with a hot wire anemometer. The first\ntracing is from the Crau plain, the second from;the summit of Mont\nVentoux ( 1,912 meters), and the third is that of a sea breeze.\nIt can be seen that the wind is less turbulent over the ocean than\non land, even when blowing over a plane.\nThe above observations were made with fairly simple equipment.\nResearch done between 1925 and 1929 on the Ile de Rd by Huguenard,\nPlaniol and me has confirmed all these facts.\n\n\t\nV.o\n\nqj%,\t\n\nFigure 57\nSpeed of a WSW Sea Breeze\nRecorded at the Ile de Rd\nwith a Hot Wire Anemometer\n2 M above the Ground\n1 sec = 3.5 mm\n\nScale of Speed: 1.3 mm per m/sec\n\nV.\n\nFigure 58\nSpeed of a NE Land Breeze\nRecorded at the Ile de Rd\nwith a.

Here, the size of the variations is much greater\nthan in the preceding figure. Occasionally wind speed changed\nfrom 0 to 14 m/sec in less than 2 seconds.\n\nthe\n\nFinally, figure 59 reproduces a recording made by Captain\nScott in a blizzard he encountered during his mission. The\nfluctuations in this tracing are very large indeed. In a wind\nwhose average speed is 50 m/hr, there are variations of more than\n20 m/sec over very short periods of time.\nVariations of Wind Speed with Increasing Altitude\nThe study of the wind naturally includes research into the way\nin which wind speed changes with increasing altitude. Experiments\non this subject are very difficult to carry out, but they are\nindispensable for learning about the local structure of air (in the\nvicinity of flying birds, for example.) To measure speed as a\nfunction of height, it is useful to compare the readings of two\nanemometers, one fixed near the ground and the other positioned\nat various points above the first.\nAccurate results have been obtained wising ten meter tall masts\nbraced by a system of three guy wires attached to the top of the\nmast and to three points on the ground. An anemometer is attached\nto a rope passing through a pulley located on a cross piece at the\ntop of the mast. The purpose of the pulley is to raise the anemometer\n58\n\n/50\n\nto various altitudes while a support leaning agaimst...the mast keeps the\nanemometer pointed in a constant direction.\n\n4,\n$,0\nc\n^\n,^\'\n\nP,\n\nh 4,0\n\nz\n\nh 3,5\nAt 3,0\n\n$5\n?,0\n1,5\nt,0\n\nv\n\n0.5\n5\t\n\n10\t\n\n1S\t\n\n?\t 0\t\n\nA.Weiiph en mi&rr\n\nFigure 60\t\nBalloon for Lifting\t\nan Anemometer to\t\nHigh Altitudes\t\n\n2\t S 31\n\nFigure 61\nWind Speed vs. Altitude\nAccording to Topography\n(1, flat - 2,3 with obstacles)\n\nKey: a) wind\nb) height in meters\nc) ratio of speed above\nthe ground to speed at\nground level\nTo go higher up, a 4 meter balloon is attached to the three\nguide wires. (See figure 60.) The height is changed by changing\nthe lengths of the three wires. The balloon is held directly above\nthe two anemometers by two wires, one attached above and one below\nthe balloon. The wires are anchored to the ground a good distance\nupwind from the balloon. The advantage of this arrangement is that\nit can be used either on land or in shallow water and that it allows\nhigher altitudes to be observed.\nExperiments have been done on bare, level surfaces and also in\nfront of and in back of obstacles. A comparison of 200 simultaneous\nreadings, taking into account the fluctuation of the wind, has\nenabled us to learn the relationship betweea the average wind speed\non the ground and the average speed higher up. A graph of this\nrelationship can be found in figure 61. The abscissa of the points\nis the altitude attained by the movable anemometer. The ordinate\nis the ratio of average speeds above the ground to that 2 meters\nabove the ground.\n\n. -\t\n\n59\n\nThe end result of this research is that the change in the\nspeed of wind as altitude increases depends on the size of obstacles\nencountered by the wind. Curve 1 in figure 61 was made from\nmeasurements taken at Saint - Inglevert on a large level area and at a\nbeach covered by an incoming tide on the Ile de Re. It shows that\nthere is a rapid increase in the. wind from 0 to 2 meters, after which\nthe increase is much slower.\nCurves 2 and 3 were made from readings taken at Saint-Inglevert\n100 meters behind some ,large hangars 30 meters high and ;4f the Ile\nde R# in front of a 5 meter tall sand dune. They indicate that\nthe increase in wind is less rapid than curve 1 at+first, but\'-that\nwind speed continues to increase at almost the same rate up to the\nhighest altitude measured.\nThe Propagation of the Wind\n\nI_f the speed of the wind changes with altitude, what takes\nplace at ground level?

The\ndistances separating the two instruments was successively 5 meters,\n10 meters, 20 meters, 55 meters, and 115 meters.\nThe tracings obtained at 55 meters (figure 63) still show a\nvery close resemblance. At greater distances, the congruence\nremained for slow oscillations. The tracings made at 115 meters\napart (figure 64) prove that low frequency oscillations are\n\n60\n\n51\n\npropagated without major modification, while the others are\nephemeral and do not appear in both curves.\n\n10MI\t10^\'\n\nw\n\n0-1 minute\t\n\n0\n\nFigure 65\nSimultaneous Recordings of the Speed of a Sea Breeze\nMade in Brittany with 2 Electromagnetic Anemometers Placed\n46 m Above Sea Level, 5 m Apart\nin a Plane Perpendicular to the Wind\nFigures 62, 63, and 64 justify the hypothesis that, within\nthe zone that has been studied, the wind is propagated without\ndeformation, like sound waves. In other words, the measurements\nmade by two anemometers, one upwind from the other, will be practically the same as far as low frequency oscillations are concerned.\nThe only observable difference will be that the readings of the\nsecond anemometer will be somewhat later than the first.\nIn fact; the fluctuations, i.e. the gusts, are preserved pretty\nexactly. The alterations observed are not much greater than those\nof sound waves traveling at ground level.\nIn another experiment, two anemometers were placed side by\nside 5 meters apart at the summit of the signal tower at\nPointe Saint-Mathieu [Saint Mathew\'s Point] 46 meters above sea\nlevel. They were exposed to a sea breeze blowing from the SSW.\nThe resemblance of the two curves thus obtained is striking. (See\nfigure 65.)

The measurements made by the hot wire can be transmitted by\nradio.\nThe accuracy of wireless transmissions was demonstrated by the\nfollowing experiment. We attached a hot wire to the end of a pendulum\n60 cm long (figure 66). The period of the oscillations was 15 cm,\nwhich gives a maximum air current speed of 21 cm/sec. The curve in\nfigure 67, traced by the receiving galvanometer, reveals the extreme\nsensitivity of the apparatus and the excellence of the method employed.\nIn this experiment, the hot wire was not compensated. If it had been,\nthe curve traced would have been sinusoidal.\nFigure 68 also demonstrates the sensitivity of wireless apparatus.\nThe tracing here is of a wind whose maximum speed was less than 0.40\nm/sec.

The average wind speed was 10 m/sec.\nA record of the wind on the same day and time, but 9 km inland,\nis found in figure 70. The anemometer was placed in the midst of\na grove of fairly tall trees. It Was located 23 meters above the\nground, or about 5 meters above the tops of the trees.

Here, the fluctuations\nare much weaker, and the amplitude is usually much less than 5 or 60,\nrarely going as high as 10\xc2\xb0.\nIn figures 75 and 76, the inclination and direction of a wind\nalso at the summit of Mont Ventoux can be compared. These high speed\ntracings show that directional oscillations have a larger amplitude\nthan those of inclination.\nLastly, figures 77 and 78 show that on uneven terrain at a height\nof 10 meters, the oscillations of the vertical component of the wind\nhave an amplitude half the size at 2 meters. This is not true on a\nlarge beach, as shown in figures 79 and 80, where only small differences\nwere found between 1 and 5 meters.\nOur experience thus showsthat the amplitude of oscillations of\nwind inclination is related to topographic conditions.\nSimultaneous Study of Speed and Inclination\nIt is often necessary to compare s_xtultaneously fluctuations of\nspeed, inclination, and direction in a-given wind.\nFor this, all one needs is a single hot wire instrument and two\ndouble hot wire meters, one placed in the horizontal plane and the\nother in the vertical. The first double hot wire device measures\ninclination, the second direction. The signals from the three instruments are then all recorded on the same paper. We were able to record\nall these instruments at once by creating \'a device that automatically\nunrolls and develops photographic paper (figure 81). The unroller\ncontains a 6 cm wide reel of film. The film goes through a series of\nrollers and past a lens where it is exposed. It then passes over a\nroller impregnated with developer and another roller impregnated with\nfixer. A final roller conveys the film out of the machine. The\nmotion of all these rollers is synchronized by means of a circular\nchain driven by a variable speed motor. By means of this arrangement,\nthe film is developed and fixed in 1 to 3 minutes after exposure.\n\n65\n\n/55\n\nV\n\nFigure 81\nH.M.P.

W sinq_ Obstruction Currents\n\nAlthough the winds that traverse relatively calm seas or flat\nplains appear to be generhlly horizontal, this is no longer the case\nwhen they encounter uneven terrain. They then conform to the deformations they find. I have proved this in experiments which I shall\ndescribe here.\nMethods for Detecting the Existence of Ascending Wands\nI employed balloons 40, 75, and 100 cm in diameter, according to\nthe speed of the wind under study and the height of the obstacle in\nthe path of the wind. Once the balloons were inflated with hydrogen\nto the desired diameter,they were counterweighted so as to float at\nrest in calm air. The ball000ns were then launched at different points\nexposed to the wind. Since the buoyancy of the balloons was cancelled\nout, they were pushed along by the air current and followed its path\nvery closely. If the wind were horizontal, the trajectory of balloons\nwould also usually be horizontal. They would ascend or descend only\nif the air current was rising or falling. If they were observed to be\nmoving back and forth, it was because they had entered a region of\nturbulence.\nOnce the balloon was launched, its movements could be followed\nwith a theodolite. However, it was preferable to film them. It was\nthus possible, with the aid of a reference mark or coordinate lines in\nthe field of the camera, to deduce the height of the balloon above the\nhorizon (if the diameter of the balloon is known) and then the exact\ntrajectory that it had followed. Similar results may be obtained by\nusing smoke, which has been used in some very fruitful wind studies,\nespecially concerning eddies. However, only a restricted area can be\nstudied at one time.\nThe film reproduced in figures 86 and 87 was made at Blanc-\'Nez\nin a strong wind. The counterweighted balloon in the film was 75 cm\nin diameter. As the frames progress, they show the displacement of the\nballoon, released 5 and 10 meters from the ground, and 100 meters away\nfrom a 20 meter high hill.\n\n\t\n\nThe trajectory of the balloon was drawn by plotting point by paint\nthe positions found in the film. Instead of having to measure the \t\n/58\nposition of the balloon on all the frames, a photographic method which\ndirectly traced the balloo \'s path on one print Is imaginable.\nThis would consist of successively projecting all the negatives onto\nthe same sheet. ( See figure 88.)\n\n73\n\n\'. ^.,..^\ni\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\n^\n\n\t\n^.^.+ ^4\xe2\x80\x9e\'^^ ",\xe2\x80\xa2 .^"^^^ ., r.\'C\n\n^r\n\nK^ R +\nt t ^ ^^v^^ y \xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2 .",rte ^= 4 "\'tom\t\n7^^^^.*; ^\t\n1Y^\n1^. ^ \'r1i.\'^ ^;.\nu\ns \'^^^. \xe2\x80\xa2 :s \'`+^\t\ny ^ .3 ^\'-\t\nb\na T\t\n\n^t - . .R ..^ a. . y^\n\nFigure 88\nPath of Counterweighted Balloons in a Wind Flowing from Right\nto left. Left: Released 2 m from the Ground; Right: Released\n10 m Up ( Transferred from Successive Film Frames)\nAnother method of obtaining the exact direction of the wind\nabove uneven terrain is to use a double hot wire indicator, as\nhas already been described.\nThe following approach, based on changing the refraction index\nof part of the air current, serves to map out the path of a stream of\nair encountering an obstacle in a wind chamber. A very fine electric\nwire is placed at the entrance of the experimental chamber in a wind\ntunnel. The stream of warm air that leaves the wire refracts light\ndifferently than the neighboring streams of cool air. An arc lamp is\nplaced 10 meters from one of the ends of the chamber, whose two sides\nare covered by mirrors. A uniform lighted area then exists on a screen\nplaced perpendicular to the light beam. The warm air streams are then\neasily distinguishable against the screen. In figure 89a, a photograph of a stream propelled by the air in a -wind tunnel is reproduced.\nIt is horizontal. What happens whenthe sa:<<e air stream comes up\nagainst an obstacle is shown in figure 89b. It is first deflected\nupwards and then is pushed back down again..\nThe Influence of Terrestrial Obstacles on Horizontal Winds\nI have conducted a great deal of research on the effect of obstacles\non winds passing over them. Except on the part of myself and Idrac,\nthere has not been much work done on this subject. Here are the conclusions I have reached.\nMy research has shown that the smallest obstacle causes changes\nin -the path of a normal, horizontal surface wind. A wall, for\nexample, causes a very clear deflection of an air current. The\nwind goes up and over the wall, producing small eddy currents in\nfront of it. The eddy currents are more noticeable if the weather\n\n4\n\nf\n\n74\ni\n\nis dry and there is dust or sand near the wall;. A small pile of\nsand or dust is then formed in front of the wall. The higher the\nwall, the further away the pile is. In back of the wall,, another\nzone of eddy currents may be found. Turbulence is caused here by\na reduction in air pressure and the consequent rush of air toward\nthat spot. A tree or small cabin is enough to cause similar perturbations. (See figure 90.)\n\nFigure 89a\nWarm Air Stream Propelled\nfrom the Left by Cool Air\nCurrent in Wind Tunnel\n\n59\n\nFigure 89b\nWarm Air Stream Propelled\nfrom the Left by Cool Air\nCurrent in Wind Tunnel and\nEncountering an Obstacle\n\nWhen a horizontal surface wind encoutners a\nvertical cliff or a slope, the lowest layers of\nthe wind give rise to local eddy currents at the\nfoot of the obstacle (figures 91 and 92), just as\nin the case of the wall. \t Meanwhile, the other\nlayers are forced upwards, towards the top of the\nslope or cliff.\nAs the air roves upwards, it comes against\nother layers of air which have preserved their\noriginal horizontal trajectory. \t These upper layers\nare then also deflected upward, the extent of this\nFigure 90\ndeflection depending on how high they are above the\ntop of the obstacle.\t At the same time, the-series\nPath of Air\nCurrent Hit.of collisions between layers of air has the effect\nting a Wall,\nof gradually pushing the upward moving layers back\nShowing Eddies ,.down towards the general direction of the current.\nand Sand Pile\nThe deflection is usually not detectable beyond a\ndistance of three times the height of the cliff at\nthe point where the wind passes over the ridge. \t Sometimes a deflection is noticeable at four times the cliff\'s height because the\nmagnitude of the deflection depends on the average speed of the\nwind.\nThe area where ascension is the greatest is located above and\t\nahead of the edue of a cliff. and a little ahead of the summit of\n\n_\t\n\n_\t\n\n75\n\n/60\n\nan obstruction current.\na hill.

The snow suspended in the air clearly outlines the large area occupied by the zone.\nForests cause a similar disturbance in the flow of air (figure.\n94). The same may also be said for waves.\n\n+150\n0\n15 0\n\nFigure 95\nRecording of the Ascensions Causes by an Ocean Swell\nas Measured by an Anemometer 0.50 above the Crest of the Waves\nThe Oscillations Greater than 5 0 Are Due to the Wave\nThe Rest Are from the Wind Itself\nAs everyone knows, when a steady grind blows across the sea, it\nproduces waves separated by regular intervals. A "swell" is the name\ngiven to this phenomenon.\nIn strong winds, swells, or waves, if you prefer, ripple\'up in\ntheir turn and form supplementary wavelets. If the wind becomes\nviolent, the crests of the waves are foamy. I got an exact idea of the\nphenomenon by placing a hot wire inclination indicator 50 cm above the\ncrests of the highest waves.\n77\n\nThe oscillations of large ampplitude, representing theassage of\nthe waves, can be seen in figure 95. As a whole, the phenome\nnon\nis the same, whether it consists of a hill or a wave ( f igure 96) .\nIn both situations the deviation depends o; i the height and inclin\nation of the obstacle. However, in the ca se of a wave, the upper\ndeflections of the lower layers of air are not linked to the\nabsolute speed of the wind, as is the case for an obstacle on the\nland, but to the speed of the wind relativ to the wave. This is\nwhy the deflections observed in the ocean ire usually smaller\nthan those observed on land. If the speed of the wind is less than\nthe speed of the waves, everything takes p Lace as if the wind was\ngoing in the opposite direction. The risi; ig current is located at\nthe spot where the wind is encountered by :he leeward side of the\nwave,\n\nFigu- 97\n,-e\nFlow of Air Streams above a Calm Sea and Uneven Ground\nFigure 97 illustrates the manner in which air streams flow\nover a calm sea and a region of uneven ground.\nIt also seemed to me to be important to find out at what\ndistance before a hill or a cliff the deflection of the air current\ncaused by the obstacle could first be detected. I have learned\nthat this distance is a function of the height of the obstacle and\nof the speed of the wind. For a wind of 8 to 10 m/sec, the influence\nof a high cliff or hill with straight slopes can normally be felt\nabout15 times its height ahead and 20 times its height behind the\nobstacle. For winds of 15 m/sec, greater distances were found.\nI have observed that the cliffs o f the English Channel and the\nheights of Villacoublay, which are 100 meters high, induce deflections 2 km after the winds have passed them by.\n\n78\n\ns\n\ng\nThe Speed of Rising Obstruction Currents\n\nY\no\t\n\n_<\n\nFigure 98\nSimultaneous Recordings of a Sea Breeze Made at Cap Gris-Nez\n\nLeft: at the Foot of an $0 m High Cliff; Middle: 2 m above\nthe Edge of the Cliff; Right: 50 m behind the Cliff\n\nI\t\n\nThe speed of the wind is also greatly altered by the obstacles\nthat the wind encounters. Thus, the strength of the wind is 20%\ngreater in the vicinity of a cliff. In certain cases, the increase\nattains 30% or even more. Moreover, the degree of reinforcement does\nnot always appear to be independent of the original speed of the\nwind. At Cap Gris-Nez [Cape Grey Dose], I have observed winds of\n4 m/sec at the bottom of a 80 meter cliff peak at 8 m/sec 5 meters\nabove the top, and retain a speed of 7 m/sexy 50 meters later. (See\nfigure 98.)\nI have, however, also noticed that forests have the opposite\neffect. They usually reduce the speed of the wind. In.the lee-zone\n.itself, the reauction is often 25% and the effects of the trees\npersist for several-hundred meters, depending on the forest\'s extent.\n\np\t\n\n_\n-15\xc2\xb0\nrig;, 1aJ\n\nFigures 99 & 100\nSimultaneous Recordings of the Inclination of a Sea Breeze\nLeft: 0.50 m above the Top of a Sand Dune\nRight: 2 m from the Top of the Same Dune\nFinally, rising vertical currents have variations In inclination\njust as surface winds do, as may be seen in figures 99 and 100.\nThe study of rising air currents by means of counterweighted\nballoons also allows the vertical component of wind speed to be\nmeasured near a slope.\nThis was the method I used to discover the distribution of speeds as a function of altitude for a westerly\n79\n\n\t\n\nwind i n the Villacoublay region whose average speed was 15 to\n20 m/sec. ( See figure 101.)\nBecause of the nature of the terrain, there is a constant\nupward air current around Villacoublay. The winds, after blowing\nthrough the Va11Ce de la Bievre [Bievre \'Valley], come across the\nheavily wooded slopes of the Homme Mort [ Dead Man] and are forced\nupwards. They thus acquire a vertical speed which still has a\nmagnitude of 1 to 2 m / sec 200 meters behind the slope, at 300\nmeters altitude. This speed is also caused by the fact that the\nterrain slopes upward from the wooded area to the edge of the air-\n\nfield.\n\n..b\nSD\'-\n\nI\ts\n\nf\n^^\'S9 00 I. /x^\n\ni\n\n-.\n^^\t\n\nI\t\n\nf\n\nf\n\n#\t\n\nf\n=\n\nf\n\n,3\nVoArrde41 Ric vrt\n\nFigure 101\nCurves of Equal Vertical Speed\nfor a 15 to 20 m/sec Wind in\n\nthe Villacoublay Region\n\nFigure 102\nHiram Maxim\'s Apparatus\nfor Studying the Formation\nof Convection Currents\n\nKey: a) Altitude in meters\nb) Wind: WSW to ENE\nc) Bievre Valley\nd) Dean Man Woods\n\ne) Villacou b lay Plateau\n\nf) (Read: 0.50 to 1 m/sec, 1.00 m/sec\n\n80\n\n1\n\nIL. Rising Thermal Currents\nInequalities of heat also lead to disturbances in the flow of air.\nIn fact, vertical currents can occur in the absence of any obstacle. Z6\nExperience has demonstrated this. When the intensity of the\nsun\'s rays is great for a long time, the surface of the earth heats\nup and warms the air in contact with it. The air becomes lighter\nas it warms up, and this gives birth to rising currents. Idrac\nhas observed that the temperature of such currents is higher than\ntie surrounding air by as much as 1.50.\n.As the air rises, it gradually cools down and becomes heavier.\nIt then descends again toward the earth\'s surface. The entire\nperformance seems identical to the convection currents observed\nin the laboratory by Sir Hiram Maxim, who produced them by heating\na metal plate with a lamp. The air expands, ascends, and hits another\nplate cooled by a container of ice. It then cools down and\ndescends (figure 102). Idrac has been able to photograph such\nconvection currents,\nThe important point is to be able to recognize the presence of\nrising currents of this sort.\nMethods for Detecting Thermal Currents\nOne would think that it would be sufficient to launch balloons\nof perhaps 1 meter in diameter inflated with hydrogen. The balloons\nwould then be tracked with a theodolite or filmed by a camera with\na telephoto lens. By knowing the exact diameter of the balloon,\nthe distance of the balloon from the observation site at predetermined intervals could be calculated. From the angle of ascent, the\nheight of the balloon could then be figured out, All the elements\nneeded to calculate the vertical speed of the balloon, and therefore of the air current, are thus present.\nIt is also possible to use counterweighted balloons which\nare launched at various points in the area under study. If the\nballoons rise, its is because the air currents are lifting them. If\nthey descend, it is beause the air current is descending.\nIt must be noted here that the results thus obtained are never\nmore than relatively accurate, especially after the balloon reaches\nan altitude of 1,000 meters..\nTo get a real idea of a rising current, other ballasted balloons\nmust also be released from a certain height. The differences in\nspeed observed between the balloons in their ascents and descents \t\nwill then reveal if there really are rising currents in the locality.\n\n81\n\n/64\n\nFigure 103\nMeteorogram Obtained from a Powered Aircraft\nPoints 6-10 on the Lower Curve Correspond to\na Level Flight with Engine Stalled\nT Temperature; i = Pressure\nThere is another, more convenient method for exploring the\natmosphere at high altitudes. This is to mount a meteorograph on\nan airplane to record the pressure and temperature during the\nascent and descent of the airplane. If there is no rising current\nin the region traversed during the part of the flight made with the\nengine shut off, there will be a regularly decreasing pressure curve.\nIf the air is indeed rising, the path the airplane takes will\nno longer be inclined toward the ground, but will be horizontal,\nor even pointed upwards. As long as it is flying through a rising\ncurrent, the pressure curve will be more or less horizontal. This\nvery characteristic curve may be seen in figure 103.\nIt is thus possible to draw from such data the fluctuations\nin the inclination of the airplane and to deduce the vertical speed\nof the wind.\nDistribution of Thermal Currents\n\nFrom my experience both on land and sea, I have come to realize\nthat there exists a constant exchange in the atmosphere. The cold\nair descends towards the earth in certain places, spreads out on\nthe surface, warms up, and then rises up again in other places. This\nphenomenon takes place everywhere, on the land as well as on the sea.\nSuch rising thermal currents are very obvious in Africa,\nwhere I observed them during several field trips. As soon as the\nsun\'s rays become strong, the earth heats up rapidly, especially in\nthe desert. The air is then heated up in its turn and immediately\nbegins to rise. An ascending current is thus produced. In calm\nair it is practically vertical. Balloons rise with a speed greater\nthan that produced by their buoyancy, and their trajectory is\nalmost vertical. The actual vertical speed is generally rather\n82\n\nweak; it depends on external conditions.\nThermal currents increase in intensity with the heat of the day.\nThey are strongest at midday. They are also related to atmospheric\nconditions, and, for example, diminish or cease entirely when thick\nclouds cover the sun for a period of time, thus reducing the heat of\nthe soil. in addition, thermal currents are linked to the seasons.\nThey are stronger in summer than in winter.\nThe most important influence, the sun\'s rays, is evident when\ncomparing diurnal and nocturnal currents. The large difference between\nnighttime and daytime is on the one hand based on the fact that the\nlower layers of air are heated up during the day, while they cool back\ndown again during the night. On the other hand, the earth\'s surface\nheats up unequally, in terms of both speed and temperature. This Alias\nto do with the nature of the surface in a particular locality. The\nwater, wet regions, evert the forests heat up more slowly and less\nstrongly than fields, arid steppes, or rocks. For this reason, during\nthe day, and if the wind is wear, a descending current of air is formed\neverywhere that water and land come together, e.g. marshy prairies or\nswamps and fields, and ascending ones wherever steppes and forests meet.\nAbove hills, towns, and in the middle of the country, rising air\nmasses are also found, whereas in nearby forests and waterways equal\nmasses of air are descending and compensate for the rising masses.\nIt has been noticed that air masses rising above a very hot region converge higher up, i.e. they have the form of a chimney, and sometimes at,\ntain the remarkable speed of several meters per second. All around them\ndescending currents form. The position of the chimneys changes rapidly.\nSometimes they may be found at one place, sometimes at another. Cumulus\nclouds arise above the chimneys. Such clouds are characteristic of\t\nascending wet, warm air masses. In and below the cumulus clouds\n(figures 104 and 105), rising air, currents predominate, while in the\nintervals between the cloud* the air. descends.\nThe largest vertical movement inside a cloud has been estimated.\nat 0.5 m/sec. The greatest speeds have been found. on the southern\nfaces of clouds. On the opposite side,the air has often been observed\nto be falling. Even the form of the cloud may be used to draw conclusions about the vertical movements in its area of influence. Within\nand underneath clouds resting on a definite unified base, rising motion\nis greatest if the cloud has a rounded bottom. The rounded bottom is\nreally detached parts of the clouds which are in the process of dissolution and consequently have only fleeting vertical motion.\nTo sum up, as an absolute rule, it may be expected that under a\ncumulus cloud a rising current will exist, and that in the gaps\nbetween the clouds the air will flow downwards.\n\n83\n\n/61\n15\n\n\t\n\n^ r Y. \xe2\x80\xa2.. y ..^:^ i^ ^ /yam\nw\t\n\'\t\nt\n\t\n\xe2\x80\xa2^.rj^\'~..r .., .^,\n1 Yom,\t\n\nri\xe2\x80\xa2^ ^\xe2\x80\x9e.\n\n..\n.\n\n\'.\n\n^\'\n\n;vim :^\n\n^\t\n\n_\n\n:\xe2\x80\xa2^)\n\n\xe2\x96\xba -^ as ^\t\n\n,^^ ^ . \xe2\x80\xa2\'^^.: .. \'r\xe2\x80\xa2,\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n^..^,^.^^\t\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\n`.\n\n-h\n\nFigures 104 & 105\nTy p es of Clouds under which F.xist Rising Currents (from Georgii)\n\nE.:perimental Data\nPere are the results of one set of measurements:\nHeight\t\n\nVertical Movement\n(-desceneing, +ascending)\n\n0 -- 50 \'n\n-- 242 m\t\n\n+0.18 m/sec\n\n242 -- 316 m\t\n\n+t:.63 m/sec\n\n316 -- 698 m\t\n\n+1.35 m/sec\n\nThese measurements were taken while approaching a squall cloud.\nThey show that vertical upward motion increases as one gets near the\n\ncloud.\nIn Germany, Georgii has done some very interesting work in this\narea. tie too found that below cumulus clouds (figure 104) there\nalways exist strong updrafts.

This was obtained by\nobserving the alterations occurring in the path of an airplane.\nGeorgii also observed that in front of storm clouds there are\t\nalways strong rising currents with a vertical speed as high as 7 m/sec_.\nRising currents of this sort are very frequently encountered in\nr\nall equato- ial regions, which are very hot. They can be formed as\neasily on dry land as over the ocean. In temperate regions, they\noccur especially during the summer.

With\nthe aid of the .instrumentation in the truck, we were able to begin\nthe measurement of the accelerations and angular velocities existing\nin winds. (See figures 111 and 112.)\n\nFigure 113\nSimultaneous Recording of the Inclination I\nand the Angular Velocity.w of a 10-12 m/sec NNW Wind\nobserved at Marignane at a Height of 5 m\nScales: Inclination, 1 mm = 1 0 ; Angular Velocity, 1 mm = 12\xc2\xb0/sea\n113 is a simultaneous recording of changes in inclinFigure-\t\nation of a 10 to 12 m/sec NNW wind observed at Marignane 5 meters\nfrom the ground. The maximum values are +27.5\xc2\xb0 and -30\xc2\xb0. Located\nabove the inclination curve is a tracing of the angular velocity,\nwhich was provided by the convertor. The maximum observed angular\nvelocity was 200\xc2\xb0/sec, while the average angular velocity came\nout to be 53 0 /sec. Note that in 1/3 second, the angular velocity\nchanged from -108 0 /sec to +96\xc2\xb0/sec, and from -120\xc2\xb0/sec to +1000/sec.\nFigure 114 is of interest because it contains a simultaneous\nrecording of the speed and inclination of a gentle NNW wind made\nat 30 meters above the ground.\nThe speed turned out to be fairly constant. As to the inclination, its fluctuations had a maximum amplitude of only 7 to 8\xc2\xb0.\nThe acceleration and angular velocity curves are alsg quite\nregular. The maximum acceleration was less than 8 m/sec , and the\naverage was 3 m/sec . For the angular velocity, the maximum was\n90 0 /sec, and the average was 26\xc2\xb0/sec.\n\n89\n\n69\n\n(t)\n\nWN .......\t\n\n1.\xe2\x80\xa2 1 Second\n\n-4\t\n\nV\n\n1\n\nFigure 114\nSimultaneous Recording of the Speed V, the Inclination I,\nand their Derivatives, Acceleration y, and Angular Velocity w\nof a NNW Wind 30 m above the Ground\nScales: Speed, 0.75 mm - 1 m/sec; Acceleration, 1 mm = 5 m/sec2;\nInclination, 1 mm = 1 0 ; Angular Velocity, I mm - 120/sec\nOur tests revealed that the wind accelerations during a storm\nat sea are no greater than those in a wind rubbing against the earth\nand only having a speed of 3 to 5 m/sec.\nThe observations that could be made about the inclination of\nthe wind are similar to those made before. A sea breeze recorded\nat a height of 10 meters reveals the smallest angular velocity,\nwhile a land breeze exhibits a greater variety of inclinations and\nLarge angular velocities.\nA Formal Definition of Turbulence\n\nWith the aid of our study of the accelerations and angular\nfound in the wind, we have been able to start measuring\nair turbulence.\n\nvelocities\n\nGiven a mass of air at rest or moving at a uniform constant\ntranslational speed V 0 any supplementary, superimposed movement of\nspeed v, variable in magnitude or direction, is considered turbulent.\nFor an observer propelled by the wind at its average speed, for\nexample in free floating ballasted balloon, air movements capable\nof being detected by the anemometers placed on board are what\nconstitutes air turbulence.\nThis definition is obviously arbitrary since it depends on the\nchoice of instruments for measuring the characteristics of the wind.\nWith sensitive instruments of a low response time, such as we have\nbuilt for our studies,the detectable turbulence is usually much\nsmaller than that which, has an appreciable effect on an airplane\nor even a bird.\n\n90\n\nWOO-\n\nIn our previous studies, we exposed instruments that recorded\nspeed and direction to the wind. Our apparatus was set up at a\npoint 0 and we recorded on a cylinder the wind velocity W, its\ninclination a and its orientation 6 in relation to the general\ndirection of the wind.\nDuring the period of observation, the wind possessed an average\nvelocity V which was defined in terms of both magnitude and direction.\nIf, at every instant, we find the difference between W and V, we\nobtain a set of vectors u (figure 115), which represents the\nturbulence of the mass oT air passing over the apparatus at point 0\nat each instant.\n\nr\n\n\',\n1\n\n^^ U)\t\n\n0\nFigure 115\nCalculation of the\nTurbulence Vector u\n(a = inclination)\xe2\x80\x94\n\na\t\n\n^\n\nFigure 116\nCalculation of the\nAccelerationyof the Wind and\nthe Instantaneous Change in\nVelocity Ww Due to its\n\nNotation Permitting the Acceleration r\nof Turbulence to be Obtained\nThe plots of the anemometric readings containing the value at\nevery instant of V and a, provide the basis for deducing the\ngeographic distribution of turbulence along the line of the current\nbetween the times T and T + t. The characteristics of the\nturbulence for the entire air mass can be gathered from the grouping\nof the vectors u along all the parallel lines of current.\nIn addition, the acceleration of air turbulence is the basic\ncause of the extra loads the , wind imposes on, e.g., a glider. The value\nof this load can be derived by constructing at every point in the\natmosphere the vector r, which represents the acceleration of the\nturbulence. This vector is the geometric sum of the acceleration\ndW/dt = Y of the wind and of the instantaneous variation of the\nvelocity of the wind Ww due to its rotation (figure 116.)\nThe Measurement of Turbulence\n\non the portion of the curves of velocity V, acceleration ti,\ninclination T, and angular velocity w reproduced in figure 114,\nwe have measured the turbulence and the acceleration of turbulence\n91\n\n70\n\nlo\n\nevery 1/32 second.

This variation indicates\nthe existence of periodic undulatioib similar to a sort of atmospheric\nswell. A whirlwind-like appearance may also be inferred at certain\nmoments from the variation in turbulence. The whirwind seems at\nfirst to turn clockwise, and then suddenly to reverse direction.\nIn any case, examination of the vectors in these first results\nshows that the rotation is sometimes so rapid that measurements\nshould be made not every 1/32 second, but every 1/100 second.\nThe measurement of air turbulence made i- this manner by hot\nwire instruments allows the state of the atmosphere to be described\nindependently of the speed with which the wires encounter the wind.\nIt would therefore be possible to place the instruments in an airplane and make a series of flights through the atmospheric region\nunder study. The airplane could fly through a given volume of air\nin the direction of the wind at various altitudes and thus obtain\nmeasurements of turbulence along regularly spaced lines of flow.\nThe actual speed of the airplane would not interfere with the\nmeasurement of wind acceleration or angular velocity. A single\ndisturbance du encountered by an airplane is of relative magnitude.\nIt is greater the faster an airplane is flying. However, as the\nairplane increases in speed, the disturbance acts on it for a shorter\nperiod of time. In other words, the amount of motion communicated\nby a disturbance to an airplane depends only on the disturbance.\nitself, and not on the speed of the airplane.\nVariations in Turbulence\n\nHere ay e several observations on what we know about atmospheric\nturbulence.\nIf the turbulence or agitation from the ground up to 150 meters is\nrepresented by the number 100, studies have shown that the turbulence\nat 300 meters is only 50, at 600 metersit is 43, and at 1,200 meters\nthe value would be 26.\n93\n\nWhereas the wind increases by 10% between 10 and 20 meters up, the\nturbulence decreases by 27%. It is consequently the region near the\n\nground that\n\nis the most turbulent, and the turbulence diminishes rapidly thereafter. It has also been observed that the greatest agitation of\n\nthe wind occurs around noon. In good weather, a more regular motion\ntakes over towards evening.\n\nFrom all that precedes, it must be concluded that atmospheric\nagitation is due to heating of the soil by the sun\'s rays and to the\nrubbing of the air against the earth\'s surface. Agitation is facilitated by a rapid decrease in temperature with increasing altitude.\nThis is generally at a maximum in our part of the globe when the wind\nis blowing from the northwest or north.\nThe leeward sides of forests or mountains are distinguished by a\nmuch greater turbulence than the windward sides. The faster the wind\nis blowing, the further fromthe mountain can turbulence of this sort\nbe detected. It has not yet been definitely established that there\nexist sources of turbulence in unobstructed parts of the atmosphere.\nIn the meantime, increased turbulence has been observed within and\nat the edges of cloud layers.\nAt night, the internal agitation of the air diminishes, not only on\nthe ground, but at high altitude, though probably to a lesser degree.\nThe calming of the air begins in the evening at ground level and\nclimbs slowly upwards toward higher layers of the atmosphere.\nHowever, at dusk there is frequently an ephemeral agitation that\nis greater near the ground than higher up. This phenomenon has been\nattributed to an unequal cooling of the soil.\nIncreasing the wind speed increases the turbulence by an equal\namount. The oscillation:- of the wind around its average value are on\nthe order of 25 to 30%.\nHow does such agitation affect an airplane? The motion of an airplane through turbulent air may be very aptly compared to a path through\na terrain broken by trenches. When gliding at a large angle of inclination, the effect of the air is less because it is forcefully compressed\nunder the wings and weak oscillations are not as significant.\nBecause of the small extent of undulatory turbulent movements, an\nairplane is hit by several waves at once, which partially cancel each\nother our. At most a light vibration of the aircraft can be felt.- At\nfirst, however, before the airplane has attained sufficient speed,\noscillations near the ground could be much more unsettling, since the\npuffs of air often touch only a single wing.\nTo , sum up, it has been noticed that the agitation and the turbul- /73\nence of the air are strongest in the spring and at the beginning of summer, when the wind is blowing from the north and the northwest, and when\nthe temperature goes down rapidly with increasing altitude. Atmospheric\nturbulence is;least before dawn, in autumn, during southerly or southwest winds, and when the fluctuations of the wind are small.\n\n94\n\nAll the past investigations that we have undertaken have confirmed that turbulence varies in inverse proportion to the distance\nfrom the ground. It would thus be interesting to extend our research\nby using an airplane specially equipped to study the movements of\nthe atmosphere and to see if it would be possible to detect the\napproach of the ground by the increase in turbulence.\nIV. The Periodicity of the Wind\n\nA natural extension of the preceding discussion is to try to\nfind out the shape of air currents and to learn what their general\nmotion looks like.\nAn examination of wind speed curves of diverse origins all show\na clear periodic character. Even if periodicity does not exist in\nthe rigorous sense of the word, it nevertheless seems that normal\nwinds contain disturbances of constant length. An examination of\nfigure 118 reveals large disturbances visible at first sight. In\nthe interior of these, other, smaller perturbations exist which have\na certain periodicity.\n\nFigure 119\nWind Speed Curve\nMade 300 m from the Ground\nShowing Periodic Characteristics\n\nFigure 118\n\nA Tracing of a Land\nBreeze\'s Speed, Showing\nan Obvious Periodicity\nConstant Length of Sections of Air\n\nIf the average speed of the wind is multiplied by the duration\nof the most regular appearing disturbances, the product, which would\nrepresent the wave length if the phenomenonwere really periodic, is\n\nb\nas\nusually around 375 meters, the ;a le, below shows.\nIII,\nLe Havre Beach\t\nParis\t\nBeach at\n\nSables\t\n\nMont Ventoux\t\nSea\n\n(Conquet)\t\n\n\'^\t\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2I1\t\n\nki!1\n\nN\t\n\n6.141\t\n\nlilt\t\n\n:172\n\nsill\t\n\n:;.N)\t\n\nS I;\t\n\nCrau P.14 n\t\n\n1,\'\'11\t\n\n103\t\n93\t\n\n311N\xe2\x96\xba\n\n391\n\nN1\'\t\n\n7\t\n\n:i;r\t\n\n;l,Y:,\n\nSE\t\n\n-5\t\n\n77\t\n\n:1,^:\n\nN\t\n\nti\t\n\n\xe2\x80\xa218\t\n\n:181\n\n.17\t\n\n:1711\n\n11\'. S NV\t\n\n95\n\nIt can thus be seen that the higher the speed is, the shorter the\nperiod is. Everything seems to occur as if there were sections of air\nof a definite length which passed by at various speeds. If this were\nindeed the case, the sections of air in motion would have a constant\nlength independent of the strenght of the wind.\nA recording of wind speed made at 300 meters altitude (figure 119)\nhad a tracing revealing slower oscillations with a duration of 150 seconds.\nIf the average speed, 15 m/sea, is multiplied by 150 seconds, the\n/74\nresulting product is 2,250 meters, or six times 375 meters, the wave- \t\nlength found near the ground. The large disturbances seem to be made up\nof many smaller ones, some of which have a duration of about 25 seconds\nand thus a wavelength of about 37:5 meters.\nWays of Studying the Undulatory Movement of the Air\n\nWhat conclusions may now be drawn? Does this not prove that the\natmosphere exhibits a wave motion analogous to that observed in the\nocean? Does this not prove that there are atmospheric waves and\nswells just as there are waves and swells in the ocean, with wave-,\nlets in both; media?\nFortant, the Inspector General of Aeronautics, has investigated\nthese questions. He has shown the importance of resolving them\nfor aviation in a study specifically concerning the undulatory movements- of the atmosphere and their effect on aircraft.\nIt is Fortant\'s opinion that the study of undulatory agitations\nin the air should be undertaken for the purpose of discovering their\ninfluence on the propulsion of aircraft and on their safety. Not\nonly should the general study of the atmosphere be promoted, but\nundulatory motion must be particularly emphasized.\nHe says that the idea of a probable relationship between atmospheric waves and those of the ocean naturally comes to mind when it is\nnoticed that it is precisely the atmospheric agitations that create\nand maintain the waves of the ocean. Conversely, the great oceanic\nswells, which last a long time after the wind has fallen off, must\nengender or maintain a harmonic counterbalance in the surrounding air.\nSince the undulations of the atmosphere are not visible as are\nthose of the water, Fortant thinks that it is expedient to search first\nof all for atmospheric phenomena that seem directly linked to its\nregular agitations and that may be easily detected by an observer.\nHe thinks that it is in the clouds and what occurs in the vicinity of\nthe clouds that the most useful data on this subject may be collected.\nAt this point, he made a theoretical model of atmospheric swells,\nand showed `hat they could have a distinct series of waves going in\ndifferent directions at different altitudes. These waves could sometimes cross each other, superimpose, and combine into complex forms\n/75\nwithout losing their individual characteristics.\t\n\n96\n\n.....\t ....\t ..\n\nFigure 120\nSchematic Reproduction of a Recording -f the Inclination of a\nWind Showing its Quasi-periodic Character\nIn figure 120, which reproduces a recording of the larger variations\nin inclination, the existence of three oscillatory systems is striking.\nOne of them is a slow undulation having a duration of 6 seconds, the\nsecond lasts 2 seconds, and the third and smallest is 1/2 second long.\n\nlow\n\n\t\nFigure 121\n\t\nBillowing Clouds above\n\t\nthe Ile de R6\n\nFigure 122\nClouds Flowing into a Valley\n(frcm V. Zotier)\n\nConsider also the two photographs reproduced in figures 121\nand . 122. The first, which was taken above the sea, shows clouds\nthat are separated into distinct billows with an axis perpendicular\nto the wind. Given their equal widths, does it not seem that they\nclearly prove the existence of a sort of atmospheric swell phenomenon?\nThe second photograph shows clouds forced to flow through a mountain\npass by a strong wind. They recall the foamy waters of a stream\ngushing between steep banks.\nIt is now possible to conduct research into atmospheric swells\nwith the equipment I have designed in collaboration with Iluguenard and\nPlaniol.\n\n97\n\nOnc useful device is our hot wire directional indicator equil-\n\nibrated,- with two resistors and powered by a battery. The galva-\n\nnometer of the bridge thus constructed could be the thermal galvanometer\nindicated in figure 19, but placed in a.carefully evacuated tube. In\nthis case, the onnsitivity will be very great, while the lag time will\nincrease considerably. only the average inclination of the wind will\nthen be recorded. Since such a galvanometer is practically insensitive\nto .vibrations and since its response time is about 6 seconds, slow\noscillations are the only ones detectable.\n\nIt is possible to study the undulatory motion of the atmosphere\nat different altitudes with a directional indicator mounted on an\nairplane. The pilot would have to fly as horizontally as possible\nwith the altitude of the aircraft checked by an accelerograph.\nAn accelerograph, after several modifications, could also be used\t\n\nin the study of atmospheric swells. All that must be done is to\n\nattach an accelerograph to an airplane in such a way that it records\nthe component of acceleration normal to the wings. By having the\npilot execute a series of rapid elevations and dives and then let the\nairplane maneuver without intervention, the period of the oscillations\nintrinsic to the airplane mayfirst of all be measured. The oscil\nlations of the airplane, which are vertical and centered at the airplane\'s\ncenter of gravity, are recorded by the accelerograph and their period\nmay be calculated from the recording. once the period of the intrinsic\noscillations is known, the accelerograph is used to record the oscillations of the airplane caused by whatever atmospheric undulations\nexist.\nAnother procedure consists of filming the movements of an airplane or a dirigible in relation to some sort of reference mark or\ncoordinate lines. The camera could be placed either on the ground or\non the aircraft itself.\nThis study of air currents shows how important it is to be able\nto describe the configuration of the air and the wind accurately.\nTo facilitate our lives and our movements on the surface of the\nearth, to which we have been riveted up to now, we have measured and\nrecorded as exactly as possible the least change in the level of the\nland. We have also measured the size of waves that occur on the surface of the ocean and plotted the position of ocean currents for purposes of maritime navigation. The atmosphere also has its waves and\nits currents. If we want to understand the role played by these currents and waves in the flight of machines or living things, it is absolutely necessary to gain a detailed knowledge of their structure.\n\ni8\n\n76\n\nj\n\nRECOMMENDED READING\nBaldit, Mdtdorologie et relief terrestre\nGauthier i ars, aril\t\n.\n\n(Meteorology and Terrain),\n\nFortant, "Au sujet de la houle adrenne" [Atmospheric Swills], Comm.\nh l\'Assoc. fr. maritime et Adron.

(For a long time, flapping flight was called\n"rowing flight" becuase it was thought that the animal was rowing.)\nIt is practically continuous for many birds. However, even if a\ngreat number of birds belonging to all orders, from the raptors to\nthe palmipeds, rely on flapping flight almost exclusively, there are\nsome birds that are capable of utilizing other methods coming under\nthe general name of soaring. We will study these other methods later.\nBefore embarking on the description of flight, it is first\nnecessary to male a quick study of how the bird-machine is constructed\nand to have a general idea of the anatomy of birds. This will enable\nus to understand the mechanics of,flight better. Even if the examination of a locomotive apparatus does not explain its functioning, it\nIs still indispensable to this explanation.\nThe Body of a Bird\nBirds form a very homogeneous class with an organization com-\n\npletely adapted to flight.\nA bird consists of an ovoid or fusiform trunk preceded by a\nusually small head separated from the trunk by a neck of highly\nvariable length.\nThe trunk, neck, and head are covered by feathers. Some are relatively large and somewhat rigid. They are called tectrices. Others,\nknown as down, are smaller, very flexible, and more numerous on certain\nparts of the body.\nInside the body is a large cavity in which are located the middle\npart of the spinal column and the viscera: the heart, lungs, liver,\nand digestive tract.\nBetween the viscera and the walls of the body are the air sacs\n(figure 123). which can be observed by blowing air into the trachea,\nthus causing them to expand. The air sacs are connected to the lungs\nat one end and to the sternum, humerus, and femur at the other. These\nbones are riddled with cavities in which air circulates. The air sacs\nserve especially as reserves of air and also act as cushions. In\naddition, they reduce the density of the body somewhat.\nThe vertebral column includes the thoracic, lumbar, and sacral\nregions, which are more or less rigid, and the more mobile cervical\nand coccygeal regions. The ribs form rigid arcs linking the vertebral column to the sternum\'. This creates a resistant, structure that\nprovides a solid support for the muscles used in flight.\nHowever, what characterizes birds is the existence of a pair of\nwings and a tail, each covered with feathers that play an important\n\nrole.\n\n100\nOak\n\n/77\n\nF\n\nJac ^^^\xe2\x80\xa2vic.^/\n\n1^\t\n\nSoo\n\nirrlri\xe2\x80\xa2^/wig:,i/.iiic^^\n\nh\n\nTiyc\xe2\x80\xa2 i\n\n\'r\n\nm\n\nt\t\nr\nf\nt\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\n^/\t\n\nr qe\n\nl\n\n^;% G.yrEu/cs\n\nS-9c\n,9\nr\n\nb/\n\n.^h^1c\xe2\x80\xa2 rrrrr.^/ ^,\n\n/iilislii^\nFiqure\nAir Sacs in\nVentral\n(from L.\n\n^\n\n123\na Pigeon\nView\nJammes)\n\nKey: a) Cervical sac\t\nb) Intarclavical sac\t\n\nFigure 124\nLeft: Remex of a Pigeon\nRight: Schema of a Feather\n( from L.

In the entire animal\nkingdom, they alone possess them.\nEvery feather is essentially composed of a shaft, on the sides\nof which is a flat, symmetrical arrangement of barbs which in turn\nbear barbules.\t\n(See figure 124.)\nThe feathers found oil the wings of a bird are called remiges.\nThose on the tail are known as rectrices. Their structure and\ndimensions have an obvious relation to the needs of airborne locomotion.\nThe most important characteristic of wings is that they possess\na general rigidity which gives them the appearance of stiff plates.\nThis is the result of a special structure. Implanted on one side of\nthe barbs are barbules equipped with hooks. The hooks extend over\nthe barbules on the neighboring barb. These last (posterior) barbules\nare shaped so as to latch onto the hooks. The barbules are thus\ntightly linked together (figure 125).\n\n101\n\nIn addition, the remiges located near the ends of the wings\nare much stronger and larger than the others. This is because they\nmove more quickly and are therefore subjected to greater air\nresistance, as will be explained later on.\nCharacteristics of the Remiges\nIn all remiges, the shaft becomes thinner as it approaches\nthe tip of the feather. It is most often curved in such a way that,\nwhen the wing is extended, the feather\'s concave side points forward\nand downward.\nThe shaft is made up of two parts. One, the quill, is hollow\nand bare. The other section is solid and filled with barbs.\n\nA7,r Avle\t\nr\n\nA7\n\na\n\na^\'t\'tj01.a, !h3/^^\'%/Ir?l b\nl\n\nO\n\nU^\n\ntllr\nFigure 125\nArrangement of Nooks\nBinding Neighboring Barbs\n\n(from L.

As a result of this configuration, the feather is more\ndifficult to bend in this direction. In contrast to the quills the\nsections made in the part of the shaft that holds the barbs are\nquadrilateral. While the entire shaft is made of horny material,\nthe sides of the shaft corresponding to the top and the bottom of\nthe feather are much thicker than elsewhere. In addition, the\ncross sections show that the central part of the shaft is filled\nwith a softish substance resembling the pith of an elder, only\n\nharder.\n\n102\n\n/?9\n\nTo obtain an idea of the characteristics of remiges, Planiol\nand 1 investigated their flexibility and .ability to dampen\noscillations. We conducted tests on feathers from the wings of a\ngannet and a golden eagle to see how they behaved under the effects\nof static and dynamic bending.\nWe first studied the oscillation of the remiges. Part of the\nshaft was placed in a wooden holder and mounted on a recording\ncylinder with a speed of up to 500 mm/sec. The feather, deflected from\nits steady state position, was suddc-T ,,Iy released and a hair attached\nto its end traced the curve of thra (\'i4wpened oscillations.\nWe then removed the barbs froirz t; \xe2\x96\xba e feather and repeated the test.\n\nFigure 127\nDampened Movement, of the\nShaft of a Primary Remige\non a Gannet\n\nFigure 128\nDampened Movement of an\nEntire Primary Remige of a\nGannet\n\nThe test results showed that the entire feather is dampened\nmore rapidly than the shaft alone without its barbs. The comparison\nof the tracings makes it clear that almost the entire dampening\neffect is due to the effect of air, resistance on the barbs.\nThe tracings used for studying dampening (figures 127 and 128)\nreveal the frequency at which the remiges vibrate. These\nfrequencies are recorded in the following table:\nLength\n(t-m)\n\nGannet, 1g. remex\nIt\t\n\nsm. remex\nEagle, lg. remex\nif\n\t\n\nsm. remex\n\nFrequency\nw/barbs w/o barbs\n\n31\n\n36.13\n\n5 I,.\xe2\x96\xba\n\nI;\xe2\x96\xba ,\xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x96\xba\n\n34.3\n\n83\n\n1.1,:1\n\n\'21\n\n,1 1.7\n\n-15\n\n^,1.; \xe2\x96\xba\n\nThe high value of the frequencies observed shows that the remiges\nare able to follow the rapid pulsations of the wind faithfully. The\nflexibility of the wing feathers is therefore very great.\n\n/80\n\nQ\n^ rs\n\n8 7 s ,\t\nFigure 129\nDeformation of the Shaft of a\nPrimary Remex on a Gannet\nCaused by a Load\n\n6\n\nFigure 130\nDeformation of the Shaft of a\nSecondary Remex on a Gannet\nCaused by a Load\n\nTo test the exact flexibility of a remex, a feather whose barbs\nhad been removed, was held down so that its concave side pointed upward and the constrained part of the feather was horizontal., The\nfeather was then weighted down with metal brackets. A cathetometer\nwas aimed at a number of points along one of the contours of the\nshaft both before and after the load was applied. Seven 10-gram\nbrackets were spaced 3.3 cm apart on a large gannet remex. There\nwere eight brackets weighing 7 grams each placed 1.5 cm apart on a\nsmall one. In this situation, the feather took on a double\ncurvature, with the curvature near the end of the feather being\nappreciably greater than the other. The curvature of the feather\nat rest and under a load is illustrated in figures 129 and 130.\nThe extreme flexibility of the tip of a feather is remarkable.\nIt is hard to believe that any fabric covered framework could ever\ncombine this degree of flexibility with sufficient strength. The\nfelxibility is accompanied by an equally amazing elasticity, comparable to that of a spring.\n\nFigure 131\nRecordings of Speed of Wind\nfrom a Rotor Made\nSimultaneously with a Primary\nTropic Bird Remex (above)\nand a Primary Gannet\nRemex (below)\n\nFigure 132\nRecording of the Speed of\na Natural Wind of 2.5 m/s\nby Means of a Secondary\nGannet Remex\n\nI have been able to demonstrate the extreme fl:exibity of the\ntips of remiges by placing them in both an air current created by\na fan and\t\na natural wind after having fastened the sham in a\n\n104\n\nF\t\n\n01011010001PPM 61. up\n\nwooden clamp, as described above. The ends of the feathers start to\nvibrate in the air current and the hair stylus attached to them\ntraces the variations of air current speed acting on the barbs. The\ndegree of vibration of the barbs is dependent on the wind speed and\nthey are thus the basis for a high precision anemometer. This is\ndemonstrated by figures 131 and 132.\nHow the Remiges are Implanted\nThe remiges are implanted either directly in the bone of the\nwing or in an auxiliary membrane.\nThe wing is itself nothing other than the upper limb of the\nbird, adapted to flight. It therefore includes a humerus leading\nto a radius and a cubitus (ulna), which end in a greatly modified\nfree and has\nhand (figures 133 and 134). The thumb of the hand\nbeen reduced to a single phalanx. The thumb forms a "bastard wing"\nwith its small tuft of feathers. The other bony parts are fused into\na double finger.\n\nis\n\n/81\n\nThe large, or primary remiges adhere to the hand. They form\t\nwhat is called the active surface or hand. wing.\nOther, smaller remiges are located along the rear, of the\nentire forearm when the wing is extended and the bird is flying.\nThese "secondary" remiges are implanted in the cubitus and form the\npassive surface or arm wing. it supplies the \'bird\'s lift.\nFinally, there are tertiary vemiges which begin at the elbows\nand continue up to the flanks of the birds. They are attached to an\nauxiliary membrane and form a sort of extension of the passive\nsurface of the wing.\nThe distal barbs of all these feathers are shorter than the\nproximal ones. They are arranged in such a fashion that proximal\nbarbs are always covered by distal barbs.\n.Besides the remiges, there is another type of less rigid\nfeather, the coverts, which exist above and below the wing between\nthe forward edge of the wing and the barbs of the remiges. They\nserve to cover this region and give it a continuous form.\nWhen the wing is extended, it thus forms a flat surface analogous\nto a fabric covered airplane wing. In theory it is impermeable to\nthe air when a bird glides or lowers its wings.\nThe Bony Parts of the Wing\nThe head of the humerus is lodged in a cavity called the glenoid\nfossa which is situated at the junction of three bones: the eoracoid,\nthe scapula, and the acromion fork. Together they form a groove\npointed downward and obliquely toward the rear. This groove is convex\nin the legnthwise direction and laterally concave. The head of the\n\n105\n\na\n\nhumerus, on the other hand, is convex in every direction, but is\nflattened parallel to the major axis of the body. F\xe2\x80\x9es a result, it\nhas a major and minor axis like the glenoid fossa. Thus, the two\nmost normal movements are those in which the humeral head\nrolls either along the large diameter or the small diameter.\nIn the first case,the humerus separates from the body and the\nwing is extended. In the second case, thixextended wing is either\nraised or lowered. It would seem from what has been said that\nthese are the only two ways a bird can maneuver its wing. However,\nthe head of the humerus can in fact move in every direction because\nthe glenoid fosses is not deep enough to restrict its movements. The\nhumerus can consequently rotate about its own axis.\n\nRadius\nRAaind\n\nC/17 VIC61VE\n\nCoivcoide\n\n!/erAcabrese\n"cony\nyiciincs\nL;IA\n\n\t\nFigure 133\n\t\nSkeleton of a Pigeon\n(from L.

It can shift the wing into the appropriate angle.\nSimilarly, the jointed structure of its wings enablesit to move\nthe tips of its wings forward by a simple contraction of its\nmuscles.\nThe cubitus is capable of making flexing and extending motions\nin relation to the humerus. It can also rotate about its axis from\nthe outside inwards or in the opposite direction, according to\nwhether it is being flexed or extended. However, flexing of the\n\nl0 6\t\n\nt1RI^mAL PAGE IS\nOF POOR QUALIn\n\n/82\n\n1\n\n\t\n\nforearm on the arm cannot take place without the band bending reciprocally in its turn. All theae movements are connected and are executed at the same time without the animal having to intervene consciously.\nFinally, the phalanges and, consequently, certain primary remiges,\ncan rotate about themselves to a small extent and also move downward between the others. This makes possible hand wing movements used to\nensure lateral stability in flight.\nBecause of its jointed structure, the primary remiges ,attached\nto the posterior edge of the hand are spread out and separate from\neach other when the wing is extended. The hand, drawn by the small\npalmaris muscle, becomes curved in such a way that its posterior\nedge is convex. Also, the primary remiges located there are forced\nto separate from each other. When the wing folds up, on the other\nhand, the posterior edge becomes concave and the feathers are pushed\ntogether until they touch. In a similar manner, when the wings are\nbent, the secondary remiges pivot and slide over each other. This\nchanges the orientation of the barbules and layers along the cubitus.\nWhen the wing straightens out, the secondary remiges once again\npivot and spread out as they stand up above the cubitus, becoming\npractically perpendicular to it,\n\nFigure 135\t\nAnterio-posterior Section\t\nof the Wing of a Gannet \t\n\nFigure 136\nDeformation of the Ends\nof the Wings of a Golden\nEagle (Frontal View)\n\n^\n\nFigure 137\nAnte,rio-Posterior Wing Section of a Marine Soaring\nBird Showing the Deformation\nOccurring in Flight and\nthe Vibrations at the\nTrailing Edge Caused by the Wind\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2r\t\n\ny\n\nFigure 138\nSea Gull in Gliding\nFlight with Wings\nExtended Showing\nthe Double Curvature\nof Secondary Remiges\n107\n\nr,...\n\nThe Properties of Wings\nAll bird wings are concave on the ventral side, regardless of\ntheir form. This concavity extends in all directions. It is not\nvery great longitudinally, but the transversal concavity is more\naccentuated. An examination of a win;t s an.te1-io-post er3..or section (fig.\n135) reveals first of all a resistant plane on the bottom side. This\nplane is fairly shallow,\t\ninclined upwards by a few degrees, thick,\nand located directly underneath the bony masses and musculature of\nthe upper membrane. The remiges, partly covered by the coverts,\ncome next. At rest, t hey are always arched downward and make an angle\nwith the plane. The angle becomes less obtuse as it gets closer to\nthe body.\nWhen a bird flies,, the wing undergoes characteristic deformations\nthat modify its shape independent of any outside influence. During\nflight, when the wings have to support the body weight and are\naffected by the action of flapping, the accentuated curvature observable at rest is considerably attenuated. First of all, the longitudinal curvature appears null or reversed at the end of the wing\'s\nactive surface (figure 136). In addition, the wing shows a new\ndouble curvature going from front to back. The shape of the anterior\ntwo-thirds remains partly fixed because of the rigidity of the bony\nmasses and of the shafts. This section of the wing still conserves\na little of its grooved shape, with the concave side pointing downwards. In contrast to this, the ponterior third of the passive surface is raised upward (figures 137 and 138).\nI have put wings through some true static tests. Figure 139c\nshows the form that a gannet wing assumes under the effect of a\n11.800 kg load. The considerable resistance of such materials,\nwhich support thirteen times their weight without breaking or\npermanent deformation, can thus be appreciated. The flexible part\nof the wings only supports 1.480 kg. The rest of the weight is spread\nout over the bony masses. In this situation, the wing had a normal\ndouble curvature.\n\nCM\n\nL.\n\n35\n\n3\n\n30\n\n3\n\n25\n\n2\n\n20\n\na\n\nFigure 139a and b\nDeformation (B) of the Hand Bones (Left) and Forearm Bones\n(Right) of a White Stork Caused by an Applied Load\n\n108\n\n/83\n\nI\n\n&-wico-6pach4l\n\nBiceps\n-\n\npcclora^\n\n^cclor\xe2\x80\x9e/ b\n\nFigure 140\nFigure 139c\t\nArrangement of\xe2\x80\x94Muscles of\nDeformation (B) of a Gannet\t\nWing Caused by a Load of 11.8 kg the Anterior Member of a\nPigeon ( from L. Jammes)\nKey: a) Small pectoral\nb) Large pectoral\nNature has thus made wings very solid, very resistant to\nstress, and very flexible.\nWing Muscles\n\nWings are activated by muscles which are arranged inothe same\nway as the muscles of the anterior members of other vertebrates. The\nonly difference is that some muscles have atrophied and others are\nmore developed than in other animals. The wing muscles enable birds\nto: 1) Extend their wings, 2) make the wings move in a more or less\n\nvertical up and down motion during flight, 3) fold their wings up\n\nagainst their bodies when they want to rest. These movements are\nmade by extensor, flexor, elevator, and depressor muscles.\nThe most characteristic muscles are the depressors and.elevators,\nwhich have undergone considerable development. The depressor is the\nlarge pectoral. It makes the wing descend when flapping and is\nusually cf very large volume. It is anchored to the large tubercle\nof the humerus and to the ribs, the clavicle, the outer surface of the\nsternum, and the carina, a sort of keel with which the sternum is\nprovided and which is perpendicular to it (figure 140). The elevator,\nor small pectoral, which lifts the wing during flapping, takes up\nless space and is found below the large pectoral. It is inserted at\none end in the angle that the carina forms with the body of the\nsternum (figure 140). After having passed betweenthe clavicle and\nthe coraeoid, it terminates on the upper part of the humeral head.\nThis represents a very ingenious mechanical arrangement.\n\n109\n\nThe Tail\nThe small coccygeal vertebrae can move over each other. The\nlast of these vertebrae, which holds the retrices, which are feathers\nwith a constitution similar to that of the remiges, is very large\nand flat and possesses an extreme mobility.\nBecause of this property, the tail has a considerable importance\nfor birds:. It is most Frequently used as a rudder during flight,\nalthough it is true that it is not always an organ of flight. (For\ncertain species, it often serves as an ornament or even, in the case\nof the wagtails, as a balancing mechanism when walking on the ground.)\nBirds can, as a matter of fact, separate their retrices from\neach other or squeeze them into a smaller space. When the tail is\nwell spread out, they can also raise it, lower it, twist it about\nits axis, and point the left or right part upwards or downwards.\nThanks to its very great mobility, the tail of a bird is a\nveritable rudder which can form either a rigid surface or a surface\nthat is deformable in any direction. The retrices are imbricated\nin the same manner as remiges are.\nFinally, birds have posterior limbs. These include first a\nfemur connected by ajoint with a bony belt that constitutes a sort\nof pelvis. The femur is oriented so that its end is close to the\ncenter of gravity of the organism when it stands on its feet.\nAfter the femur come a tibia and a very thin fibula, then a tarsus\nand metatarsus joined together in one piece, and finally the digits.\n\nSuch an arrangement led Belon in the sixteenth century to\ncompare the skeletons of a man and a bird, indicating the analogous\nbony parts along with the modifications that they had undergone.\n\n110\nI..___\n\nRECOMMENDED READING\nAlix, Essai sur l l appareil locomoteur des oiseaux (An Essay on the\nLocomotive Apparatus of Birds], Paris\n+Jammes, L., Zoolo ie\' rati ue basie sur la dissection [Practical\n904).\nZoology Based on D ssecti.ons , Masson, Paris\t\nMagnan, A.

The eye of the observer perceives the entire movement as a\n\nblur and the final impression is merely one of alternating up and\ndown motion. It is thus impossible to specify the details of flapping\n\nprecisely by simply observing birds in flight.\nThe number of times a bird beats its wings\n\nvaries and could be\n\n3 to 6 or 8 times per second according to whether it is in mid-\n\nflight or about to take wing. The movement of\n\nthat our eyes only\n\ndetect the general outline\n\na wing\n\nof\n\nis so rapid\n\nthe movement. We\n\nnotice only that there is up and down beating, that an alternating\nmovement of the upper limbs exists.\n\nThe best proof of this is the fact that the majority of painters\ndepict birds in flight in the form of a V or, most often, in the\nform of a circumflex accent.\nWith the aid of the motion picture photography invented by\nMarey, he and his successors have precisely identified the steps\ninvolved in a single wingbeat.\nMethods for Studying Wing Motion\n\nWhen one wishes to study the actual movements of a wing in\nrelation to a bird\'s body, an ordinary fined motion picture camera\nwill do well enough. The erection of a set of reference marks in\nthe field of the camera to determine the exact position of the bird\nis not necessary. However, if one wishes to go deeper into the\nanalysis of flight, for example to determine the effects of a wingbeat, the displacement of the bird, its trajectory, or its speed, the\nunsuitability of this method is obvious. if it is desired that the\nfilm contain a fairly large portion of the bird\'s trajectory, the\nimage of the bird itself will be too small. To increase the dimensions\nof the photographs in order to make precise measurements, it is\nindispensable to increase the focal distance of the objective. Since\nthe width of the film, is constant, the photographic field is reduced,\nand it is no longer possible to keep the camera in a fixed position.\nIt is therefore necessary to use an apparatus that moves\nabout a point and has a telephoto lens. Consequently, the field\nof vision will be small. The moving object to be photographed can\n\n112\n\nthen be followed by eye with this type of instrument, while the\nposition of the camera is recorded on each photograph made. One\nis thus led to using two systems of coordinates: one for locating\nthe object in the field of the camera, and the other for locating\nthe axis of the camera in relation to a fixed set of coordinates\non the ground.\n\n86\n\n,t\n\nL.\n\n1 ytW\t\n\ny\t\nJt\t\n\n^\t\n\n^\t\n\n^\t\n\nAo\t\n\nti\t\nV4 at +^._\t\n\nt\t\nt:\'\t\n\n^tj ,T.\n\ny\'r \xc2\xaby.\n\n\'lam}\t\nT\n\n\xe2\x99\xa6 ^k\'1\n\n^ s1\n\n\t\n\nt\t\n\nr\n\nFigure 141\nDouble Objective Camera Gun for Recording\nthe Path of an Airplane in a Coordinate System\nH.M.P. Double Objective Camera\nHuguenard, Planiol, and T have studied a whole series of equipment that can simultaneously photograph a moving object and two\nfixed graduated circles before which the axis of the objective can\nbe moved.\n\nHowever, such an instrument must practically attain the perfection of astronomical instruments to achieve a satisfyinq level of\nprecision. This is a prohibitive demand for an apparatus that we\nwanted to be transportable.\nWe have been able to resolve this problem thanks to the generosity\nof Fortant, the Director General of Aeronautics, who made the\nnecessary funds available to us.\nThe studies were conducted in the testing department directed\nby Dumanois who, along with the engineer Earlaut, helped us as much\nas possible to find a solution to the problem of determining flight\npaths. This is a problem that has preoccupied the entire field of\naviation.\n\n113\n\nWe used a Debrie camera gun to carry out our experiments. This\napparatus is used to train fighter pilots.. It has the same dimensions\nas a machine gun and is installed in an airplane in place of the\nactual weapon. The pilots who are engaged in combat exercises\nstrive to get their adversary within the field of their camera gun,\nwhich is "fired" like a real machine gun and simultaneously photographs the enemy airplane and a chronometer. Since the two chronometers were synchronized before the exercises began, the winner, the\none who first got his adversary within his line of sight, may be\neasily determined.\nWe or 4 ginally used the Debrie camera gun to record at the same\ntime an airplane, a chronometer, and a square mesh netting erected\non the . ground a little bit in front of the objective. To accomplish\nthis, we mounted the camera gun on a stand containing a universal\njoint which can be used to adjust the position of the axis passing\nthrough the fixed optical center of the camera lens. The stand is\ncomprised of a special J. ght, rigid, collapsible tripod made of steel\ntubes. In the center-, it holds a large steel tube in an upright\nposition.\nThe large tube contains a shaft which turns on ball bearings.\nOn top of the shaft is a frame containing two ball bearings with a\ncommon horizontal axis which intersects the vertical axis of\nrotation of the shaft and frame. Between the bearings is placed\na second frame, which can rotate around the horizontal axis. on this\nframe is fixed a support that holds a counterweight in the front and\nthe camera gun in the rear. The camera gun is adjustable in all\ndirections so that the optical center of the objective can be made to\ncoincide with the point common to the two axes of rotation. The\ncamera gun is thus moveable in every direction around the optical\ncenter of its objective. This point then becomes a fixed center of\nperspective around which photographs are taken independent of the\nposition of the camera gun.\nThe fixed reference lines that are used to measure the angular\ndisplacement of the airplane are made of square steel wires held in\na frame. The wires are spaced both horizontally and vertically at\nregular intervals. The regulatity of their spacing is maintained\nby kinking the wires so that they have a twisted form and a sawtooth\nprofile of fairly large slope.\nTo use the apparatus, the frame is placed in a vertical plane\nperpendicular to the direction. in which one wants to film the airplane.\nThe airplane is thus viewed through and approximately perpendicular\nto the frame.\nHowever, to carry out this simple procedure, the coordinate\nnetwork must be placed far enough away to obtain a clear image. To\npreserve a sufficiently large field of action, it would then be\nnecessary to have an excessively large framework, which would make\nthe method impractical. This is because the Debrie camera gun has\na 210 mm objective with an f/6 focus, which means that the hyperfocal distance corresponding to an acceptable clearness of image is\nvery great.\n\n114\n\n/87\n\nWe avoided this difficulty by means of a combination optic\nwhich can simultaneously obtain in the same plane clear images of\ntwo objects, one situated at infinity and the other, the coordinate\nnetwork, as close as possible (figure 141). For this, a secondary\nobjective, with a focal distance equal to the distance at which one\nintends to place the wires, is mounted in front of the actual\ncinematographic objective. The former objective masks a part of the\nsurface of the latter. This section may be chosen at will and, in\nour apparatus, is the annular zone external to the principal objective.\nThe light rays coming from the airplane or bird that hit the\nfree central zone of the cinematographic objective provide a clear\nimage of the flying object in the conjugate plane. The rays coming\nfrom the coordinate network, which hit the annular objective, give\nan image of this framework placed at the same distance as the\nairplane and, consequently, after their passage across the cinematographic objective, converge equally on the same conjugated plane.\nClear imagesa of the network and of the airplane are thus simultaneously\nobtained in the same picture.\nExperience has shown that the two blurred images, one provided\nby the airplane through the double objective system, and the other\nby the reference framework through the principal objective alone, do\nnot appear on the.film if the annular lens and the uncovered part of\nthe principal objective have the same area.\nWhat is more, the angle covered by the coordinate network is\n:fiarly small, since the network, which contains close to 500 squares\n46.2 mm on a side, is only 1 meter by 1 meter and is placed 2.2:5\nmeters from the camera gun. When the optical axis slants` - g\ntoward the normal to the plane of the reference lines, the focal\npoint of the annular objective is never far enough away to bring\nabout an annoying decrease in clarity.\nMaking Films\t\n\n/88\n\nI have used this apparatus to determine he path and the form\n\nof avian wing movements every time my studies involved a large\n\nspecies in its natural surroundings flying at a fiarly great distance\nfrom the apparatus. In contrast, when I was able to work in the\nlaboratory with birds that I was able to make fly around in front of\nthe objective, I used only a single lens movie camera focused on a\nset of coordinate lines placed several meters away. I then filmed\nthe experimental animals as they passed in front of the network.\nt\n\na\n\nHowever, only binds that beat their wings two or three times a\nsecond can really be studied with an ordinary motion picture camera,\nwhich takes only 16 frames a second. Unless considerable lengths of\nfilm are used, only fuzzy im ages, always corresponding to approximately\nthe same position of the win g in space, are obtained with birds that\nflap 10 to 15 times a second. In this case, ultra-high speed equipment, such as the camera desi gned by Noguos or the one built by\nDebrie, which take more than 200 frames per second, have to be used.\nThe film is then projected a t 16 frames a second and the movement of\nthe wing is thus slowed down for the viewer. I have employed such\n115\n\ncameras to record the flight of various birds simultaneously with a\nuquare mesh marking out reference coordinates and the oscillations\nof a pendulum which indicated the film speed.\nDescription of a Wingbeat in Horizontal Flight\n\nFilms of this nature still do not provide precise information\non the position of the wings during a single beat, despite the slow\nmotion. To discover the exact positions of the wings, it is necessary\nto enlarge each frame corresponding to part of the flapping cycle.\nThey must then be examined and the images measured. This is what I\nhave done for the parts of the films that are the most interesting.\nFigure 142 shows a pigeon flying in front of and parallel to a\nset of coordinate lines. The successive frames contain the various\npositions of the animal in almost horizontal flight during a\ncomplete flab of the wings. The point where the wings begin to be\nlowered has been arbitrarily chosen as the beginning of the cycle.\nThe first thing that strikes the observer is that the wing\nmoves forward at the end of the downward movement of the wings.\nFew observers have noticed this. On the contrary, before the\ninvention of the motion picture camera, many believed that the tip\nof the wing was thrust rearward by the bird and had innacurately\nconcluded that birds make a rowing motion. This error was the result\nof confusion caused by the relative movement of the body and the upper\nlimbs.\nBefore moving downward, the wings of a pigeon are raised above\nthe body, forming two almost parallel vertical planes. They are then\nbrought downward until their lower surface is more or less horizontal.\nIt can then be seen that the ends of the primary remiges soon\nbend upward under the effect of air resistance. At this point, the\ntwisting of the wing is very clear and whereasthe plane between the\nbody and the hand is basically horizontal, the active surface moves\nupward. One can thus see both the upper and lower surface of the wing\nat the same time.\nLittle by little, the tips of each wing move forward in such\nmanner that they approach each other in front of the breast with\ntheir lower surfaces facing.\n\na\n\nWhile maintaining this position, the leading edges of the wings\nrise up and completely encircle the anterior part of the body.\nDuring this time, the articulations of the wing are bent little\nby little, with that of the hand rising above the body. As soon as\nthe rising motion is finished, which causes the forearms to be\nparallel and directed upwards, the hand wings separate until they\nform a continuous line. They then rise until their upper surfaces\ntouch each other. This is the end of the elevation of the wings.\n\n116\n\n.^\t\n\na\n\nF"WM\n-.%\n\nf\n\nt- -\n\ns\n\nt\n\n`-\n\nt\t\n\nV\n\' .^\xe2\x80\xa2:i\'i\n\xe2\x96\xbas\n\nFigure 142\nFilm Made through a Set of Coordinate Lines of Pigeon\nWing Motion in the Course of a Wingbeat during Horizontal Flight, 110 Frames per Second\n(Read from Top to Bottom and from Left to Right)\n\nPAGE I5\nP ^X) R\n\t\n\n117\nQUALM\n\nI\n\n9\nI\nI.\nFM\n\nFigure 142 Cont.\n118\n\n.m\n\nt\n\nTracings of an Ante rio-Posterior Section of a Wing in Flight\nLet us take the articulation of the hand and the part of the\ntrailing edge, i.e. of the remex, located on an anterio-posterior\ncross section parallel to the body and passing through the\narticulation of the hand, as reference points in the study of\nwing movement. A faithful representation of the various inclinations\nof this section may then be obtained by projectincl- it on the plane\nof symmetry. In fact, to get a correct representation, the projections should be made on three perpendicular planes, one horizontal\nand two vertical. To do this requires recordings made by three movie\ncameras. Unfortunately, this is a very difficult operation to carry\nout successfully, first of all because the bird\'s trajectory cannot\nbe controlled and secondly because it is very difficult to obtain\nthe synchronization of the three cameras. Marey attempted it, however,\n40 years ago with chronophotographic apparatus.\n\nFigure 143\nTracings in the Vertical Plane of an Anterio-Posterior Section\nof a Pigeon Wing during a Stationary Wingbeat\nLeft: Downward Motion, Right: Upward Motion\n\nFigures 144 and 145\nTracings in the Vertical Plane of the Anterio-Posterior Section\nof the Wings of Two Pigeons in Flight\nFigure 143 gives the tracings of the anterio-posterior section\n\nof a wing through the articulation of the hand, that result from\n\nsuch projections on a vertical plane. In this case, they are for a\nwingbeat made by a pigeon sitting on a perch and flapping its wings\nwhile stationary. It should be noted that at the end of the downward\nstroke, the wing plane at the level of the hand, which was directed\n\n119\n\nbackward and slightly downward, suddenly changes direction. The\ndownward stroke ends with the lower surface. forward. Then, at the\nmoment when the wing returns rearward, the lower surface is pointed\nslightly upward and remains so during the entire retraction. At\nthe end of the rearward movement, a new change of direction occurs\nand the lower surface is returned town approximately horizontal\nposition.\nFigures 144 and 145 reproduce tracings made on the animal\'s plane\nof symmetry by the anterio-posterior section of the wings of two\npigeons in mid-flight. Taken at wrist level, they reveal analogous\nchanges of direction while flapping their wings. The tracing is\t\nless spread out in one of the figures than in the other because the\nspeed of the bird was less.\nOne thing to remember is the change in inclination of the wing\nplane at the moment when upward motion starts and when the wrist\nbends. (This resultsin the remiges hanging almost vertically.)\nNature has created a fortunate arrangement here. If the upper surface\nof the wing struck the air in an upward direction during the raising\nof the wings, a notable loss of altitude would occur and would cancel\nout the effect of the downward push. Instead of striking the air as\nthey do when bird and wing advance, each temex pivots as the elbow and\nwrist bend and ,cuts through the air. Standing up almost vertically,\nit only exposes its leading edges to the air when the wing is moving\nupwards, as Marey has already pointed out.\nPath of the Wing Tip During Horizontal Flight\n\nThe study of the same successive frames of a pigeon in flight\nalso enables the vertical projection of the path of the wing tip\nand its translational speed to be traced. One could even record the\nmotion of any given point of the body, from the eye to the tip of the\ntail. Figures 146 and 147 illustrate such paths for two different\npigeons. One curve, A, traces the movement of the wing tip, another,\nQ, is the displacement of the tip of the tail, and the last, 0,\nrecords the motion of the eye.\n\nFigures 146 and 147\nPaths of a Wing Tip (A), the End of the Tail (Q), and the\nEye (0) of Two Pigeons in Horizontal Flight\n\n120\n\n/90\n\nCurve A shows that the tip of the wing moves downward and forward\nduring horizontal flight. It then moves back upward and rearward. The\n\nspeed of the tip can be found at every point of the flight from the\nseparation that exists between two consecutive points of the trajectory.\nIt has been found to be greater than 5 m/sec.\nAs has frequently been observed, the wing tip moves rearward\nbefore going upward at the end of the downward stroke. It thus\ndescribes a sort of loop.\nmore\n\nAt this moment the speed is the greatest. The tip then rises\nor less vertically and returns rearward. At the moment when the\n\nwing is extended, the tip is suddenly thrust forward. Furthermore,\nanalogous movements are found in both projections.\nFinally, notice that the vertical projection of wing tip displacement oscillates around the axis of flight, which it crosses\ntwice during a revolution.\n\nIf one first defines, as we have, the end point of the downward\nwing stroke as when the tip of the extended wing is at its lowest\npoint, an examination of the path of the tip will then prove that the\ndownward thrust is quicker than,the upward thrust. This is calculated\nfrom the time intervals between frames and is the opposite of what\nMarey thought.\n\nRocking Motion of the Body during Fligh t\n\n\t\n\n/91\n\nThe curve produced by the movement of the tip of the tail\nillustrates another phenomenon: the elevation of the posterior\npart of the body during the downward thrust of the wing. The\nrocking motion reaches a maximum when the wing tip is located down\nbelow the body. The tail occupies a lower position when the wing\ntip has been thrust completely upward. This conclusion can be\ndrawn just as easily from either figure 146 or figure 147.\nThe curve produced by the motion of the eye also reveals undeniable oscillations.\nFinally, a fact ledtned from a film is that wing speed is\nlowest immediately after downward and upward thrusts. Its speed is\nthe greatest in the middle of each thrust.\nThe Frontal View of Wing Movements\n\nWe have had the opportunity to examine successive prints made\nby two other birds, a vulture and a seamew, viewed From the front.\nThe lowered wing is extended in vultures and becomes almost\nflat. The exception is at the end of the wing, where the primary\nremiges are pushed upward by air resistance. Note that the wing is\nrigid until the end of the downward stroke (figure 148).\n\n121\n\nFigures 148 and 149\nForm and Successive Positions of Vulture Wing (Frontal View)\nduring Downward Motion (Left) and Upward Motion (Right)\nThe wing starts to fold up with the beginning of the upward\nthrust. The joints at the elbow and the hand bend little by little\nat the same time that the arm wing inclines in relation to the axis\nof flight in such a manner that its lower surfaces faces slightly\nfrontward. The forearm becomes more and more vertical and the\nhand wing, which was hanging down almost vertically, is raised\nupward again. It is extended until the banes of the hand form a single\nline with the bones of the arm and forearm.\n\nA\n\nFigure 150\nForm and Successive Positions of a Seamew Wing (Frontal View)\nduring Downward Motion (Left) and Upward Motion (Right)\nFigure 149 clearly illustrates the movements of the wing. The\ncurves are a reproduction of the forms that the leading edge of the\nwing assumes during wingbeats.\t\n\nFigure 15.0 -is derived from a film of a seamew flying toward the\ncamera.\nAs a whole, the movements of the wing are the same as for the\nvulture. However, an examination of the figure reveals that the ends\nof the primary remiges are not pushed upward. Further on we will see\nthat this is the result of the greater resistance of the wing tips of\nthese birds.\nI was also able to study wing motion in birds who beat their wings\nvery rapidly in flight,\n\n122\n\nZ12\n\n^\n\nFigure 151, which is the film of a weaver in flight, proves that\nmovements of the wing in this case are again similar to those of\npigeons or falcons, for example.\nit now remains for us to examine the takeoff and landing of\nbirds.\n\nAs for takeoff\', it can be accomplished at an angle or even\nvertically in certain species, such as pigeons.\nWind Motion while Hovering\n\nLet us take the case of vertical flight. A film of a pigeon so\nengaged is reproduced in figure 152. Everyone knows that this\nanimal is perfectly capable of hovering at a fixed point in the air\nby flapping its wings in an almost horizontal plane. It meanwhile\nholds its body absolutely. straight.\nThe wings first strike the air with their inner surface, i.e.\nthe bottom of the wing, a little like a pigeon on a perch. The wings\nalso change inclination after each half flap. However, in this mode\nof flight the tip of the wings at the end of a stroke directed\nfrontwards meet almost directly above the head, like a muff around\nthe front part of the body.\nWing Motion during Oblique Ascending Flight\nDuring oblique ascending flight, wings move in approximately\nthe same manner as before, but the body is inclined at 45 0 instead\nof being horizontal.\nIn a pigeon rising obliquely, the two wings are extended almost\ncompletely above the inclined body at the moment when they begin to\nmove downward. As the wing is lowered more, it forms an approximately\nhorizontal plane except at its tip, where it is twisted by air resistance. This causes the ends of theprimary remiges to stand up. The\nwing remains flat during descent until the moment when its tip is\nclearly below the body. At this point the plane is inclined towards\nthe rear until it becomes almost vertical. The wing tip is simultaneously projected strongly forward until it reaches the level of the\nhead and joins the tip of the other wing.\nThe articulation of the folded hands-like the elbo%* rises\nabove the body. The hand wing, which was spread out parallel to the\nbody is then raised upward more and more and forms a plane perpendicular to the major axis of the bird. The remiges then become\ndistinctly separated. Following this, the articulations straighten\nout and the remiges come together again. Finally, the wings are\ncompletely elevated and extended, with. their dorsal surfaces almost\ntouching.\nDuring this period, the tail is greatly spread out.\n\n123\n\nJ\n\nof a Weaver\nFlight\nfight)\n\n{\n\n1\n\n1\n(r\'y\n\n,\n\nl\t\n\n1\n\ni\nr^\n\n41\n\n^-\\\n1\n\nFigure 151 (Cont.)\n()}tlt; F\', L YAG\n\nOF Pf\xe2\x96\xba^) \'\n\n125\n\nf\t\n\nF\t\n\n\'^\n\nfit(\n,n\n\n_irr\n\nI\n\nf\t\n\n^f\n\n\xe2\x96\xba - --- ^.-:+\'^`y^ 1,\nq.-COM.1\n\nAIM\n\n.0\n^IW\n\n6\xe2\x80\xa2^\n\nFigure 152\nFilm of the Winq Movement of a Piqeon in Ascending Flight\nor while Hovering (film by Nogubs)\n(Read from Top to Bottom and from Left to Right)\n\n126\n\nA balancing of the body around its center of gravity can also\nbe observed. This causes its posterior end to be raised upwards\nwhen the wing completes its downward stroke and to be moved downwards\nat the end of the upward stroke.\n\n93\n\nWing Motion during Oblique Descending Flight\n\nDuring an oblique descent, wing motion has been found to be\nanalogous to that detected during oblique ascent, with the body\nonce again inclined at a 45 0 angle and the head pointing upward.\nHowever, at the beginning of the wingbeat, the wing tips are first\nthrust forward, above the head. They are reunited in the rear at the\nend of the wingbeat. This occurs in such a way that the wings are\nno longer moving in a vertical plane,but in a practically horizontal\none, similar to when a bird tries to ascend almost vertically. Here\nagain, the tail is greatly spread out, the feet hang freely, and the\noscillations of the body are very clear.\nDuring the landing, a bird advances its feet and rotates its\nmajor axis into a vertical postion. Its wings are then extended\nand the leading edge is turned upward so as to break the speed of\nthe bird.\nTo conclude with a general picture of the movements of bird\nwings, one might present the following summation:\nThe surface of the remiges forms an approximately horizontal.\nplane striking the air during descent. This inclination is most\noften accompanied by a deflection of the secondary remiges which\nThe primary remiges are also\ngive a double curvature to\ndeflected and the tips of their shafts more or less stand up.\n\nthe wing.\n\nAt the end of the downward stroke, the remiges return to their\noriginal curvature in the manner of a spring going back to its\noriginal shape.\nDuring the upward stroke, the wing rotates and cuts through the\n\nair with its thin edge.\n\n127\n\nRECOMMENDED READING\nMagna, A., "Determination des trajectoires d\'oiseaux ou d\'avions"\n(The determination of the Paths Followed by Birds or Airplanes),\nRev. Gen. des Sciences (August 15, 1927).\nMarey, Le vol des oiseaux [Avian Flight], Masson, Paris (1890).\n\nLesson Seven:\t\n\n94\n\nThe Effects of a. Winngbeat \t\n\nResearchers have been working on unraveling the system of avian\nflight for a very long time. From the beginning, publications have\nemerged based on their work. Such publications are very numerous at\nthe present time. The researchers\' goal is to discover the unknown\naspects of flight that allow the animal first of all to keep itself\naloft and then to move forward.\nThe study of ordinary flapping flight shows that in this mode\nthere is a method of providing lift and propulsion very different from\nthe methods used up to now in aviation. Trying to understand\nflapping flight with analogies from aviation would lead today, as\nit has before, to attributing to avian muscles a strength greater\nthan what physiology tells us is possible. This is precisely what\nNavier did,in his calculations.\nIt is a fact that;many birds are capable of traveling over\nvery great distances without stopping to eat and without appreciable\nloss of weight. When they beat their wings in calm air, birds produce\na force without tiring themselves out very much. In any case, this\nforce comes into being without a consumption of energy the least bit\ncomparable to that needed to make an airplane fly.\nCaptain Lucas-Girardville argued a few years ago that the flight\nof a bird could only be explained when it is shown how it can occur\nwith an expenditure of work compatible with the known strength of\nthe flying organism. This is exactly the way the question must be\nposed.\nWe will see in this lesson and in the ones that follow that\nour research has allowed us to describe, at least in large part, the\nsources of the lifting and propulsive power in flapping flight. It\nhas furtheriore shown that to obtain the required lift and propulsion\nthe animal does not in. fact engage in efforts so great as to be\nincompatible with its constitution.\n\nh\n\nThe Theories ofF.lapping Flight\n.\nIt was believed fora long time that when the wing is lowered\nit strikes the air in a downward and rearward direction, Basing\nhimself on what he took to be the truth, Fabrice d\'Acquapendent\ncompared the movement of a wing to that of an oar. A little more\nthan half a centruy ago, R. Owen again argued that the downward\nthrust only caused the bird to ascend and that to push itself forward\nthe wings have to take on an angle so as to strike both downward\nand rearward.\nPettigrew\'s\n\nTheory/95\n\nOther scientists, such as Pettigrew, thought that gravity was\nnot, as might be expected, a factor simply and directly opposed to\nflight. Rather, it played a useful role in flapping flight.\n\n129\n\nAll those who carried out experiments on human or mechanical\nflight at the end of the nineteenth century were soon forced to reject\nthis theory. They demonstrated that while gravity certainly-had a\nuseful role to play in descent during gliding flight, it was insufficient to explain the mechanism of flapping flight.\nOehmichen\'s Theory\n\nSens du a\nmavveme"It\n\nFigure 153\nRelative Paths of\nCircular Flow Produced\nby the Normal Displacement\nof a Disc in a Flu`.d\n(from Oehmichen )\n\nFigure 154\nCircular Flow during\nInclined Displacement\nin Air (from Ochmichen)\n\nKey;. a) Direction of motion\nOehmichen had a theory of wing motion. He narri.ed out a very\nprecise study of rowing flight, and of the Circular burfent and\nwaves in the wake of a bird. These come into being, according to\nhim, during wing movement. (See figures 153 and 154.) He thought\nthat while downward strokes lift a bird, it is the beginning of the\nelevation that ,projects it forward. The forward motion is thus a\nresult of the recovery of the energy contained in the waves in the\nwake of the bird. His assertion that it was his observations of\navian musculature that led him to conceive of this type of rowing\nflight is regrettable. He argued, while claiming to agree with\nMarey, that the muscles of birds are just ordinary muscles, not much\nsuperior to those of mammals of the same weight. They are not at\nall extraordinary given the size of the animal. Although they are\ncertainly developed, they are not any more so than the thighs which\ndo not, however, have any especially strenuous tasks to perform.\n\n130\n\nSuch a statement does not square at all with reality, as I shall\nprove farther on.\nL. Kahn\'s Theory\n\nL. Kahn thought up the following explanation for the swimming\nof fish and the flight of birds.\nIt is not in the jerky movements that the explanation may be\nfound but in the constantly maintained correspondence between the\nmovement of the wing and its angle of incidence with the air. While\nthe orientation of the wing can vary by tens of degrees, the angle\nof incidence retains a value of a few degrees, especially in horizontal flight. This is equal to that which aerodynamics indicates would\nmake for an efficient use of the mechanical work done in agitating\nthe wing.\nIt must thus be shown how the correspondence between the\nchanges in wing position and its orientation can come about in a\ngeneral fashion. Such an explanation would hold for any type of\nanimal propulsion produced by aerodynamic surfaces in a fluid\nenvironment, the swimming of fish as well as the flight of birds.\n\n96\n\nIf one considers motion in relation to the fluid, it is bound\nto consist of movement propelling the body as a whole and a\nperiodic transverse movement of the motive elements. The combination.\nof the two movements makes the motive elements describe a periodic,\nundulated movement in the fluid.\nLet us suppose, like Icahn, a cylindrical\nc a\n\nV r\'\n\ng\nFigure 155\n\nsurface with regular undulations immersed in\na field of which figure 155 represents the\ncross section eh in the plane of the figure.\nPicture a surface element ab which follows the\nundulated surface in the general direction V\nalong the surface rah. When ab follows eh in\nthis manner, the fluid does not produce any\nretarding effects due to friction.\n\nStudy of the Movement\nof an Element ab DesThe movement ab can be regarded as the\ncribing an Undulated result of the following components:\nSurface eh with a\nspeed V or W<V (from\n(1) A unifrom translational motion of\nKahn)\nvelocity V, equal to the average velocity\nmeasured parallel to the general direction of\npropulsion.\n(2) An orbital motion, closed on itself.\n(3) A motion that orients ab so that it is constantly parallel to\nthe tangent of the resulting curve eh.\n(4) A motion deforming ab so that it conforms to all the bends\non ehr , but which nan be ignored in a first approximation. \t\nto\n\n,.^\t\n\n..\t\n\n_._ _ i ,1 ^ _.._\t\n\n..:....^ ._ _.._.^_^_....,^^..a....aeua_........^m,__..._.._d_....._.^...s,.....r...a,.,.^iar...a,ur.._\xc2\xae \t\n\n.W.._^...._^\t\n\n\t\n\n131\n\ni\n\nStill following Kahn\'s analysis, now suppose that components\n2, 3, and 4 remain constant, but that component 1 no longer has a\nmagnitude of V, but of W, which is less than V.\nInstead of remaining on the surface eh, ab will then move to\ncd and a reaction of the fluid directed approximately in the\ndirection f, perpendicular to ab, will appear.\n\nn\'\n\n1\n\nFigure 156\t\n\nFigure 157\nPath of a Pedal on a\nBicycle in Motion\n\nIt is in fact known that a profile attacked at a small angle\nundergoes a force approximately normal to its general direction.\nThis force increases about in proportion to the square of its\nvelocity, and as a function of the angle of incidence, at least\nup to a certain value of that angle.\nThe effects produced would thus depend on the value of W\nrelative to V. They would increase as the difference increased\nand diminish as it diminished. For example, the cruising speed in\nrapid horizontal flight would be that for which the resistance and\nweight are balanced by the average resultant of aerodynamic effects.\nCalculations have established that the form of the movements and\nthe power consumed would be well in accord with reality,\nIn low speed flight, liftoff, or hovering, birds, instead of\nusing the action of the velocity, substitute that of the augmentation\nof the angles of incidence coupled with a stationary agitation of\nthe wing. This causes a decrease in yield, an increase in the instantaneous efforts, and a rapid increase in muscle fatigue.\nIn place of a single element ab, suppose a flexible body able \t\nto conform to the shape of an undulated curve All its elements\nwill then undergo reactions of the same order. The transversal\ncomponents will cancel each. other out and the longitudinal components\nwill add together to produce the propulsion (figure 156).\nAs Kahn considered it, wing motion was the resultant of several\nmovments: a general displacement; a forward translational movement;\na motion that closes on itself (orbital); and, finally, a deformation\nthat makes the wing follow the bends in its trajectory.\n\n132\n\n97\n\nOne can get an idea of how this movement is broken down by\ncons tdering the undulated path that the foot of a bicyclist traces.\nThe foot advances on the road while turning around the hub of the\nsprocket (orbital motion). It also seems to oscillate about itself\nand to change form according to its trajectory (figure 157).\nThe forward motion of the wing, like that of the fish, would\nseem to result from its undulatory movement, like the "spinning"\nof a needle.\nL. Brdguet\'s Theory\nFor L. Brdguet, the rowing-like beats of a bird\'s wing in\nhorizontal flight did not serve, as certain people thought, to\nprovide the lifting force directly. Rather, it was really to\npropel the bird, which was then kept aloft by the speed that the\nbeating wings maintained.\nThe explanation and the analysis of the way flapping its wings\nhorizontally propels a bird in calm air would then follow a course\nsimilar \'to the way in which the vertical pulsations of the wind cause\nthe average aerodynamic resultant to become upright in a bird that\nencounters them passively.\n\nFigure 158\nEquipment for Studying the Air Current Created by\nthe Flapping of a Bird\'s Wing\nA perfect reciprocity would then exist between the two phenomena.\nThe flapping wing would cause a periodic oscillation in the vertical\ncomponent of the aerodynamic speed, just like a vertical pulsation\nof wind with the same force and cycle as the beating wings.,\nAccording to this author, this implies that flapping flight is\ndue to the existence of an air current possesing variations in\n\nvertical inclination Rnd created by the alternating wings. The air\ncurrent would fleutralize resistance to the advance of the bird in\nthe same way as occurs in surfaces in a wind tunnel. This has been\ncalled the Katzmayr effect.\nKatzmayr made the following experiments in a wind tunnel. First\nan air current of theoretically constant direction was maintained\nin the tunnel. A wing that could oscillate around an axis parallel\nto its leading edge was then placed in the current. The author has\nobserved that, in these conditions, the oscillation of the wing has\nthe result of giving the wing a lower polar curve. The greater the\n133\n\n,F\n\nangle of oscillation, the lower it is.\nResistance also increases significantly, and in proportion\n\nto the magnitude of the angle of oscillation. If, instead of making\nthe wing oscillate about an axis parallel to the leading edge, it is\nmade to beat in the manner of birds, the result is the same.\nI attached two wings by their humeral heads to a horizontal\naxis supported by two columns. The wings were held close to the\ncolumns and connected to a bar linked to a crankshaft which could\nbe turned by hand. (See figure 158.) The rotation of the crankshaft made the wings beat alternately upwards and downwards. I\nwanted to see if this flapping resulted in an oscillating movement\nof the ambient air. To achieve this, I used a double hot wire\ninstrument, whose cylinder was placed at several positions around\nthe wings. The instrument never recorded any curves providing\nPonvincing proof of the existence of such an oscillation of the\nwind.\nI used a similar method when I attached a pigeon to a harness,\nas Marey did. I then fixed the double hot wire cylinder either in\nfront or in back of the plane of the air. The natural beating has\nnever given me any evidence of an air current with regular variations\nof inclination which would indicate the possibility of an oscillai ng\nwind. Moreover, in a horizontal air current, a swallow, as Marey\npointed out, skims the water without rippling its surface. The\nlargest species of birds also do this.\nAnother researcher, Weyham, has stated that he has often seen\npelicans fly over the Nile during calm weather at a speed of 15\nm/sec. The pelicans beat their wings barely 30 or 40 cm above the\nriver, without agitating the water in any way.\nConstantin\'s Theory\n\nJ. Constantin, who first observed the rocking of the rear of a\nbird\'s body, of which I have already spoken, experimentally studied\nthe different possible effects of gravity on a plane. He then\ndecided that birds, by successive soaring and swooping, caused a\ncertain permanent pressure to be built up against their lower\nsurface, proportional to their weight. This would give them part\nof the required lifting force.\nTo this first cause of lift, that obtained by lowering the\nwings is immediately added. At this moment, when the animal has\nnot yet acquired sufficient speed, the force caused by lowering the\nwings provides an indispensable complement for keeping it aloft.\nIt is the difficulty of obtaining these two primary sources of lift\nthat makes some birds hesitate at the moment of takeoff.\nA bird in the air would naturally feel an inclined upward propulsive force at the moment when its wings make their downward thrust,\nbecause of the position of its center of gravity. This is similar\n\n134\n\n98\n\nto the plane in figure 159, which is provided with a moveable weight\nand a propeller or float.\n\nA ^\n\no\t\n\n^ .\n\nA\n\nFigure 159\nPlane AB Equipped with a\nMoveable Weight P and a\nPropeller H for Upward\nPropulsion (from Constantin)\n\nFigure 160\nPlane AB Designed for\nDemonstrating the Action\nof the Rocking Motion\nof the Rear of a Bird\n(from Constantin)\n\nHowever, this source of upward propulsion ceases with the downward stroke of the wings that produced it, and the bird would fall\nbackwards while raising its wings. It is at this point that the\nrear to front rocking intervenes. The rocking is produced by a\nsudden induced tipping of the plane which causes it to change\ninclination (figure 160). In the case of the bird, this is done\ninstinctively towards the end of its downward stroke.\nDuring the period when the wings are being raised, this movement ceases and the normal descending glide is resumed.\n\n99\n\nThe ascending forward motion which was caused by the transformation of the vertical action of the wings is thus succeeded by a\ndescending forward motion resulting from the rocking movement.\nWe sha-11 end this survey of the literature here. Let us leave\non the sidelines all the other theories based only on calculations\nand without . experimental foundation, even though they are very\nnumerous and sometimes interesting.\nII. Experimental Research on\t\n\nReaction to a Wingbeat\n\nWe are now going to try to give as precise, accurate, and\ndetailed a report as possible of the experimental research that\ncould shed light on the mechanism involved in flapping flight.\nHowever, despite the modesty of this program, it must be stated\nthat researchers came up against special difficulties in making\nobservations from the very beginning. These were caused by the\nfact that the air is, in general, invisible, and that as a result\nwe are not accustomed to "see" with our eyes the range of mechanical\neffects produced by the passage of a projectile, be it blimp, bird,\n\nt\n\n135\n\nor, finally, airplane. This is the circumstance that is at the\norigin of many of the errors of interpretation committed in\nregard to f light.\nThe first point to bring to light is this:\nThat which profoundly differentiates flight from other modes\nof displacement on the earth\'s surface, or even in rivers in oceans,\nis the.low density and high compressibility of the supporting medium.\nIn fact, the normal atmosphere does not offer any direct "support."\nIt literally escapes from under any solid or f"texible surface that\nattacks it.\nHowever, the mechanical effects produced by the reaction of the\nair could engender an almost vertical upward impulsion sufficient to\ncompensate or even exceed the reverse impulsion produced in the\nsame period by gravity and the resistance to the progression of the\nmoving object.\nIn the study of flapping flight, the following must all be\nsimultaneously considered:\n1) The inertia and weight of the primary moving body.\n2) The secondary moving bodies (the wings) which make periodic\norbital movements (in relation to the principal body.)\n3) The inertia (and weight) and compressibility of the\nsurrounding medium.\nAs we shall see below, there is no true direct support in the\nbasic avian flapping cycle, if by that is meant reactions originating\nin solid bodies or that could be considered as such. The influence\nof the ambient milieu on the body in flight takes the form of only\nretarded, deferred, or indirect reactions.\nVertical Reactions\n\nSome of these reactions can be Precisely documented using\ncinematographic procedures. They are reactions having to do with\nvertical or horizontal oscillations of the animal\'s center of gravity\nand whose existence may be predicted from sensory data.\nConventional methods for determining the position of a bird\'s\ncenter of gravity already exist.\na) Determination of a Bird\'s Center of Gravity\nt\nI have personally used the methods employed by my predecessors\nfor this purpose, although they have been criticized by some authors.\nI have also employed a personal method which attempted to manipulate\n\n136\n\n/100\n\nthe animal into a position identical to when it is in flight. The\nbody and the head must form a straight line and the wings must be\nkept extended as in flight, i.e. elevated, level, or lowered. The\nanimal was therefore first placed on aboard with its neck .elongated\nand its wings spread out horizontally. I then injected a solution\nof formaldehyde so as to give the wings a greater degree of\nrigidity. I thus obtained, without significant modification of the\nspecific distribution, birds in flight position. By holding an\nindividual by a clump of feathers on the back and seeing whether\nthe bird tipped forward or backward, I could tell if the chosen\npoint was in front of or in back of the center of gravity. After\nmoving thus from point to point, there finally came a time when the\nanimal was perfectly balanced in a horizontal plane. The exact\ntransverse plane containing the center of gravity could be easily\nfound in this manner. By suspending the bird by the beak or by a\nwing tip, a second plane containing the point in question could be\ndiscovered. Since the center of gravity also lies in the vertical\nplane passing through the major axis of the body, it could now be\ndetermined precisely.\nBy repeating the same procedure with the same bird after its\nwings had been raised or lowered, it was found that the center of\ngravity moves a few centimeters upward or downward in the vertical\nplane. We have seen that the wing is moved forward during a downward stroke and rearward during an upward one. The same procedure\nas before can be used to discover the position of the center of\ngravity for extreme attitudes of the wing. Experience has shown that\nthe center of gravity undergoes both horizontal and vertical displacements.\nIt is thus easy to investigate changes in position of the\ncenter of gravity by using measurements taken from motion picture\nfilm. The purpose of this is to determine the magnitude of the\noscillations of the body caused by flapping the wings.\nb) Marey\'s Experiments\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2l\n\n10\n\n20\t\n\n4n\n\nFigure 161\nVertical Oscillations of a\nSea Gull \' s Eye when Descending\n\nNyk %k\n\nFigure 162\n.Path of the E e and\ncenter of Gr^Ytx of\na Sea Gull in yFll gfit\n*\n\n137\n\nMarey made an intensive study of this question. He took a\nseries of photographs of a sea gull in flight (figure 161). On\neach photograph he picked a well defined point, such as an eye,\nwhich was always visible in spite of the movement of the wings.\nBy joining the position of the eye in the successive images with\na dotted line, he created a winding curve. The eye is therefore\nalternately elevated and lowered during each flap of the wings.\nMeasurement of eye displacement above and below the axis of\nflight revealed that the oscillations had an amplitude of 0.09\nmeters, or 0.04 meters on each side of the axis. The positive and\nnegative phases of the oscillations both had essentially the same\nduration. The positive, convex side upwards phase of the curve\ncorresponded to the downward stroke of the wing. The negative,\nconvex side downward phase occurred during the upward stroke.\nAll observers, even in Marey\'s time, were cognizant of these\nvertical oscillations, especially during the first moments of\nflight. The bird\'s body moves upward each time the wings are\nlowered. It descends during each elevation of the wings. Does this\nmean that the, mass of the bird experiences the same oscillations as\na particular point of its body? The mass of a body should in fact\nbe considered as located at its center of gravity. In a projectile\nof invariable form, the center of gravity is immobile, but this\nis no longer true for a body of irregular form whose different parts\nchange position in relation to one another.\nWhen a bird beats its wings, its center of gravity is displaced.\nIt rises when the wings are elevated and descends when 1-,hey are\nlowered. It is thus possible that the center of gravity could\nkeep to a straight line while every point of the body, individually\nconsidered., describes a more or less complicated trajectory.\n\nc)\n\nThe Huguenard--Magnan Experiments\n\nExperience seems to indicate that there really are oscillations\nof the center of gravity, but that they are of small magnitude. I\nmade a series of curves of the displacement of the center of gravity\nof a pigeon flying in front of a set of reference lines. I\'ts\ncenter of gravity had first been precisely determined by the method\ndescribed above. Vertical displacements, although of fairly small\namplitude, were indeed noted. Marey, and later Labouret, had\nalready noticed them. In figure 162, due to Marey, the crosses\nindicate the positions of the center of gravity of a bird in flight.\nIt may be seen that the center of gravity does not have as pronounced\noscillations as those of the eye, which are contained within the two\nsolid horizontal lines. In the first case, the oscillations have an\namplitude of only 1 cm, while they have an amplitude of 4 cm in\nthe second case.\nIn order to document the reaction of the trunk in- the vertical\ndirection to the beating of the wings, Huguenard and I tried to\n\n138\n\n101\n\nmeasure directly the acceleration of the animal in flight with the\naid Of an accelerograph that we designed. We attached this instrument to the back of a carrier pigeon capable of carrying an added\nload without difficulty.\n\n--__J\nFigure 163\t\nDesign of the lluguenard-tlagnan \t\nAccelerograph\n\nFigure 164\nAccelerograph for Birds\n\nThe use of an accelerometer is limited, however, by the size\nof the perturbations caused by the mass of the instrument to the\none wishes to study. To obviate this problem, we\nsystem that\t\nhave set up an accelerometer arranged so that practically all of\nits mass is made up of moving parts. To do this we made all the\nparts whose functions require an elevates: weight part of the mobile\naccelerometric mass. It is thus possible to reduce the weight of\nthe instrument considerably and to adapt it to measuring acceleration in light systems.\nFigure 163 represents an accelerometer of this type. The\naccelerometric mass is made up of the recording cylinder F, the\ndevice that rotates it, and the major part -)f the dampening mechanism.\nThe rotation is produced here by a clock movement, whose barrel\nis indicated by the letter B in the figure. A toothed pinion \t\nmeshes with a pinion attached to the frame member F which holds the\nhollow axis around which turns the cylinder. Through the hollow\naxis passes a shaft T which holds a light piston at one of its\nends. The piston moves in a space set aside for it in the lower\npart of the recording cylinder and is filled with a liquid of\nsuitable viscosity.\nThe other end of the shaft T is attached to the base of the\nalso holds up a set of columns which\ninstrument. The base\t\nsupport the frame member F by thin flexible plates. Frame member\nF gets thinner towards its right end in order to form an amplifying\nlever jointed at a tie rod. This rod guides the needle tracing\nthe variations in acceleration in the -1 irection of the axis of the\ncylinder. The center of gravity of the cylinder and frame member\narrangement is placed approximately on the line perpendicular to\nthe axis of the cylinder and passing through the flexible joint.\n\n139\n\nL1.22\n\n\t\n\nThis makes the instrument sensitive only to the component of\nacceleration (here, vertical) parallel to the axis of the cylinder.\nAdjustment of the dampening mechanism is done by orifices cut into\nthe piston which can be made to coincide more or less exactly with\n\norifices cut into a stop valve, adjustable by means of a button.\nWhen the openings do not match up at all, maximum dampening is\nobtained.\nThe mass of liquid makes up apart of the mobile mass. The\nsurface of the piston is chosen so that the pressure developed by\nthe dampener in the liquid does not exceed a small fraction of the\npressure of the atmosphere. The sensitivity of the instrument is\nadjusted by means of a detachable spring R held in place by the\nhousing. The tension on the spring is reduced when greater sensitivity\nis desired.\nThe accelerograph that we constructed (figure 164) for use with\nbirds has a form that has been slightly simplified, miniaturized,\nand streamlined. It measures 7 cm long, 3 cm wide, and 3 cm high\nand weighs 55 grams. The recording cylinder that it carries has a\ndiameter of 2 cm, makes a complete revolution once\n6 seconds,\nand produces diagrams measuring 6 cm by 2 cm. On these diagrams is\ntraced the\nacceleration in the vicinity of the bird\'s\ncenter of gravity, the movement of a wing, and also the vibrations of\na thin plate serving as a chronograph. The plate is kept vibrating\nby the mechanism recording the movement of the wing.\n\nevery\n\nvertical\n\nw\t\n\ni\t as\t\n\nr.-^.^"...\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nk\nJS/\\.\n\nFigure 165\t\nRecording of the Intrinsic\t\nPeriod of the Bird\t\nAccelerograph\n\nfigure 166\nCalibration Curve of\nBird Accelerograph\n\nThe extreme lightness of our instrument was achieved, as we\n\nhave just said, by the use of the recording cylinder and clock\n\nmovement as accelerometric mass. Because of this arrangement, 4/5\nof the device\'s weight is used to absorb acceleration.\nThe small accelerograph possesses an intrinsic oscillatory\nperiod of 1/20 second (figure 165). I\'ts starting sensitivity is\n1 mm per m/sec t of acceleration. After having been calibrated\nstatically the accelerograph was placed on a plate equipped with an\nelectric 1,Tibrator. (See figure 166.) The comparison of the\naccelera\',.ion due to the sinusoidal oscillations of the p?.te and of\nthe tracings recorded by the accelerograph enabled the exactness of\n\nthe previous calibration to be verified for a frequency of oscillation\nclose to that at which a pigeon beats its wings (around 5 times per\nsecond.)\n\n\t\n\n^\n\n4pi^^\n\n-4 -\n\nt\n\nFigure 167\nRecording of the Vertical\nAcceleration Caused by a\nMan Walking "formally\n\nFigure 168\nRecording of the Vertical\nAcceleration Caused by a\nMan Walking Asymmetrically\n\nlie used the accelerograph to record the acceleration curve\nproduced by a human being with an asymmetric pace (figure 168).

A braided silk thread wound on a reel was tied\nto the pigeon\'s feet. It was used to measure she speed of the pigeon\nand to halt its flight after a predetermined trajectory was completed.\nWe then made various recordings that proved, from the beginring,\nthat a pigeon taking - f from the ground underwent considerable acceleration. This caused s to reduce the sensitivity of the accelerograph\nby half. Figure 170 reproduces a curve traced by the readjusted\ninstrument of a bird taking wing after having been released at a\nheight of 1.50 meters. The bird was flying away at a very low speed\nwhile very strongly beating its wings 6 to 8 times per second. The\nacceleration thus attained was 4 grams. Figure 171 shows a portion\n\n141\n\n/103\n\nj r\t\n\nof the curve traced in a type of flapping flight that is less active\nthan in figure 170. It is consequently closer to full flight.

In this arrangement, positive\nacceleration causes an elevation of the curve, whereas slowing down\nresults in a descent.\nThe variation in horizontal speed can be made visible by\nanother procedure, consisting of tracing the measurements made can\nthe film of a bird flying parallel to a set of coordinate lines.\nThe abscissa is the time in sixteenths of a second and the ordinate\nmarks off the distance in meters between the bird\'s center of gravity\nin successive frames. The space between two points in the tracing\nthen represents the amount the bird has advanced per unit time and,\nconsequently, the speed of the animal at different instants.\nFigure 173 shows that a bard progresses by jerks and is projected\nforward immediately after the downward stroke of its wings is\ncompleted.\n111. The De \t\nFlictht\n\nnation of the Cause of Reactions during Horizonta\n\nThe vertical reactions to a bird may be easily explained. The\nwing, whose lower side is cl.rA,, cave during a forceful downward stroke,\ncompresses the air in a sort of pocket and succeeds for an instant\nin actually being supported by the air, which cannot escape.\nin this situation, the bird\'s body lifts itself up like a man\nwho supports himself on crutches resting on solid ground. This is\nled me to say before that the mechanical metaphor for\nwhat\t\nflight should be sought in the action of jumping, with the stipulation that in place of a solid support there must be substituted a\nbasically mobile support that flees under the force of the shock.\nThe Action of the Pectoral Muscles\nIt must be added that the elevation of a bird\'s body is increased\nby the pectoral and thoracic muscles. These muscles are supported\nby the axis through the points of attachment of the wings, as\nHoussay stated. In fact, the body oscillates around such an axis in\na rhythmic fashion. It beats around the same axis as the wings and\nat the same time. The entry into action of the muscles during the\ndownward stroke in relatior*, to this axis is clearly demonstrated by\nthe elevation of the rear of the body. This elevation is brought about\nby the action of all the muscles in motion and initiates the rocking\n143\n\nLI\n\n\t\n\n.:.#\n\nmotion already examined.\nThe study of the contractions of the pectoral muscles clearly \t\njustifies this approach to the situation. If the contraction of the\npectoral muscles is recorded simultaneous) with the vertical\noscillate is of the bird (figure 174) , as Marey has done for the\nduck and t,ie buzzard, it may be seen that two vertical oscillations\nare produced for each flap of the wings.\n\n105\n\nfigure 174\nSimultaneous Tracings of the Contractions of the Pectoral\nMuscles (Top) and the Vertical. Oscillations of the Body\n(Bottom) ,eft; a Duck, Right a Buzzard (from Marey)\nPart b corresponds to a downward stroke of the wings and part\na to an upward one. By superposing the two curves, it becomes\napparent that a vertical oscillation accompanies the raising of\nthe wing and that another oscillation in the same direction\ncorresponds to its descent. In the buzzard, it maybe observed that\nthe oscillation related to the elevation (a) is much weaker.\nThe Form of the Air Flow during a Wingbeat\nWhile it is easy to explain the vertical oscillations, it is\nmore difficult to understand, a priori, the fluctuations in the\nspeed of a bird and especially its progression in the air. Research,\nhowever, has partly revealed the cause of avian propulsion.\nFirst of all there is the question of what becomes of the air\nstruck by the wring, upon which it supports itself. We have seen\nthat it does not seem to descend or curl back around the wing.\nWe are going to show that in reality it escapes at high speed\nalong the trailing edge of the wing.\nWe owe the first experimental demonstrations on this subject to\nMuller. He constructed small spring powered motors which made a winglike object beat with a small amplitude but with great force. He\nmade the movements of the air caused by the beating visible in daylight through the use of smoke. He then noticed that the air\nescaped along the trailing edge, if the wing possessed a thick rim\non one side similar to that often observed on the anterior edge of\navian wings. The purpose of such a rim is to impede the escape of\nthe air toward the front and to channel it toward the rear, which\n144\n\n106\n\nis thin and flexible.\t\n\n(See figure 175.)\n\nIf the wing were thin and had no rim, the air would flow out\nin all directions. If, on the contrary, the rim existed all\naround the wing, the mass of air would only escape i f the movement\nof the wing were violent and rapid enough to enable it to pass over\nthe rim.\n\nIt.\n-\n\nhi\nFigure 175\nMovement of the Air under the Influence of a Stroke of the\nWing Going from vn to v\'n\' (from Muller)\nEx p erimental "lodels\nSuppose that the humeral head of the wing of a large dried\nbird is held in the hand. The wing is then completely spread out and\nquickly lowered so as to strike the air with its lower surface while\na slight frontward and downward inclination is maintained. A\ndeviation of the arm toward the rigid edge will then be observed. It\nair with the wing held flat and\nis, in fact, impossible to hit the\t\ninclined downwards. The more force is exerted, the more the arm is\ndeviated by the wing which is pulled toward its large edge.\nThis demonstrates that the forward movement of the wing during\nits downward stroke is automatic and due to the reaction of the air.\nhet us recor,unence the flapping experiment between two lighted\ncandles. It will usually be immediately evident that the candle\nnext to the anterior edge of the wing will not display any agitation,\n\n145\n\nalthough sometimes it is slightly attracted to the wing. The other\ncandle will, on the contrary, vacillate in every direction, even when\nit is far from the beating wing. If the trailing edge of the wing\nis halted at the level of the flame, the candle will surely be\nextinguished.\n...\t\n\ny ^^ ^ ^\n\ngyp,.\ns\xe2\x80\xa2ek:\xe2\x80\xa2!+\'{S\n\nf^\n^^\n\nFigure 176\t\nPropulsive Mechanism in Birds\t\nA, Flow of Air Toward the Rear\nB, Reaction Toward the Front\n\nFigure 177\nP1ine\'s Artificial Wing\n\nThese experiments clearly reveal the effect of wing flapping\non the air. They prove that the air is not projected vertically,\nbut that it is compressed in the hollow of the wing until it is\nforced out around the trailing edge and that the wing assumes a\ndouble curvature. Thf, air escapes with great speed parallel to the\nplane of the wing. (See figure 176.) Another action also occurs\nparallel to the wing\'s plane at the same time. Around the entire\nfront of the wing, the rim blocks the air from moving forward.\nThis is the reaction that makes the bird progress and that carries\nthe wing forward. It should be added here that the faster the wing\nis beating, t he thicker is the mass of compressed air.\nPline was able to reproduce these experiments with a bamboo\nwing at the ends of which a cord was tied so as to stretch the\nbamboo into the shape of an arc. Two other small pieces of bamboo\nwere curved into arcs and then attached to the main shaft and the\ncord. After fabric was glued to this skeleton, the demonstration of\nthe rearward flow of air could be made almost as well as with a\nreal bird wing. (See figure 177.)\nThe Measurement of Air Flow Speed at the Trailing Edge \t\n\n/107\n\nIt\'1^8 possible to try to measure the speed of the air current\nthat escapes from the trailing edge of a wing. To do this I\nsuspended a live pigeon in a harness, as Marey used to. The pigeon\ncould beat its wings freely but could not move its body vertically\nor laterally. I then placed a hot wire on the rear of the pigeon\'s\nwing, outside of the setup. The purpose of the hot wire, which was\ninsufficiently compensated, was to measure the speed of the air\ncurrent escaping from the trailing edge when the wing is at the end\nof its downward stroke. These experiments, to which I will return\nlater on when trying to calculate the magnitude of the reaction,\nhave shown me that the speed of the air certainly exceeds 15 m/sec,\nalthough I have not yet been able to determine the exact value.\n\n146\n\ni\n\n\t\n\nIn conclusion, it is worth remarking that the preceding\nexperiment does not yield any evidence for a similar air current\nwhen the wing is thrust upward. The wing therefore does not press\nagainst the air during its upward stroke. This is because of the\narrangement of its plane during this phase.\nIV. The Cause of Ascending Flight\n\nThe preceding account approximately described the methods used\nby birds to achieve the required lift and propulsive force. The\nmechanisms involved in flapping flight as well as all the\nreactions sustained by birds\' bodies may now be partly understood\nand explained. It is thus clear why the downward stroke of the\nwings lifts up the body of the animal and increases its horizontal\ntranslational speed, and why the wings of a bird are less well\nsupported and its speed diminishes during the upward stroke.\nIt should be stated that, on the whole, this schema applies\nespecially to the mode of flight that directly succeeds takeoff.\n\na\t\n\nI\t\n!\t\nl\t\n\nr\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\ni\n{\n\n\tc\n\nI\t\n\n{\t\n\nI\t\n\n. 1\t\n\n1\t\n\nj\n\n!\t{\t\n\nI\tI\t\n\n1I^, I\t\nV " !\t\n\ni\t\nI\t\n\n^!\n\n!\t\n\nL\t\ni\t\n\nI\t\n\nI\t\n\n1\t\n\n^\n\nI\n\nI r-\xc2\xb0,^i\n.,\n\tI\ne\'f e\'f a { f e f e\n\nFigure 178\nPath of a Point Close to the Center of Gravity\nof a Heron in Horizontal Flight ( from Oehmichen)\nKey: a) Speed in arbitrary units\t\nb) Path of the body\t\nc) Much more regular path of the head\t\n\nd) Time scale\ne) Descent\nf) Elevation\n\nWhen a bird takes wing, the mechanism involved in flapping\nthe wings is still the same. The only difference is that as a\nresult of the arrangement of the wings, which alternat e ly beat\nfowards and backwards, the air current is directed. downward in\norder to project the bird upward. The proof of this is furnished\nby the observation of birds like the pigeon which at takeoff produce\na wind along the surface of the earth that affects objects more\nthan a meter away.\nVertical progression is similar to horizontal progression and\nis accomplished in leaps.\n\n147\n\nBy following the successive positions of a point on the body of\na heron in photographic enlargements, as Oehmichen did, one can see\nthat the bird increases in altitude in the period after takeoff during\nthe downward stroke of the wings. No altitude is gained while the\nwings are lifted and very often some is even lost.\nThe curve in figure 178 refers to two sets of data taken from \t\na filmed sequence. Time is marked off on the abscissa based on\nthe interval between frames. The ordinate is the altitude corrected\nto take account of the progressive approach of the bird. The curve\nindicates the gain in altitude during the downward stroke and its\nloss during the upward one.\nIn contrast, everything seems to be regularized in full\nflight. Both the vertical reactions of the body and the horizontal\nvariations are barely visible. The speed thus assumes a uniform\nappearance while the acceleration in the vertical direction varies\nonly from 0.8 or 0.9 grams to 1.1 or 1.2 grams, as I have already\nshown.\n\n148\n\n/108\n\nRECOMMENDED READING\nBreguet, L.

Gliding Flight. \t\nWhen observing birds of various species in flight, one is\nquickly struck by the different ways they flap their wings. The\ngeneral scheina of flapping flight is always true to my description\nof it, but the frequency and the amplitude of wingbeats varies\naccording to group. As a result, the forward speed varies too.\nDifficulties immediately arise when trying to collect precise\ndata on birds\' flight speed and the frequency and amplitude of their\nwingbeats in nature. Most often, this latter .information is\nimpossible to obtain by simple observation. This is because our\nsenses do not allow us to count more than 5 or 6 flaps per second\nor to estimate the angle that a wing passes through between the time\nof maximum elevation and the time of maximum descent.\nThe situation concerning the speed of birds is the same.\nThere have been authors who believed that they could accurately\ndetermine the speed through simple observation. The figures they\ncame up with in this manner were wildly inaccurate and totally at\nodds with reality. Others, of a more scientific spirit, have\nattempted to discover the speed of birds by timing them as they fly\nbetween two landmarks. They too often committed errors, although\nit is true that these were less serious. Their errors stemmed from\nthe fact that they were not actually measuring the distance traveled\nby the animal as a function of time. Instead, they recorded an\nangular velocity from which they could draw no conclusions because\nthey did not know either their distance from the bird or the angle\nthey made with the two landmarks.\nFor these reasons, certain authors erroneously claimed that a\nswallow attained 241 km/h, a swift 316 km/h, and some falcons close\nto 400 km/h during dives. We shall see below that these figures do\nnot correspond at all with the truth.\nThere exist several procedures for collecting these essential\ndata. The most accurate is to use high speed movie cameras.\nTo determine the exact number of wingbeats per second, a bird\nis filmed at 100-200 frames/sec as it moves perpendicular to the\naxis of the lens. Also included in the camera\'s field of vision are\na set of reference lines and a pendulum.\nIf a bird is filmed in the same way as it moves toward the\ncamera, the amplitudes of the wingbeats may be measured by comparing\nthe successive frames.\nLastly, the real flight speed of a bird niay be measured^by\nreferring to the coordinate lines and the pendulum, which indicates\nthe time between frames. The only other information that must be\nknown is the length of the bird\'s body. The path of the bird in\nspace may also be determined with these data.\n\n150\n\n109\n\nI. Wingbeat Amplitude\n\n\t\nZ.L1_0\n\nThe films made of birds as they approach the camera clearly\nshow that the amplitude and even the form of wingbeats vary continuously when both ascending and descending. Direct observation also\ngives an indication of this.\nIf a pigeon is observed during an oblique ascent, it will seem\nthat the wings come together, first behind, then in front of the\nhead. (See figure 179). The angle that each wing passes through\nduring one wingbeat is almost always close to 1600.\nWhen the bird descends at an angle in order to land, the\nsituation isabout the same, except that the amplitude of the\nflapping is often slightly reduced.\n\na\n\n\t\n\nL\t\n\nc\n\nFigure 179\nDifferent Orientations of the Anglo of Oscillation of\nthe wings of a Pigeon\na, Takeoff b, Midflight c, At the End of the Flight (from Marey)\nIn contrast, when a pigeon is in midflight and moving horizontally, the successive frames of a film of its approach show that the\nwings no longer oscillate around the horizontal position by such a\nlarge amount. The total angle that they pass through ranges from\n40 to 80 0 (figure 179), according to the energy that the pigeon puts\ninto moving its wings.\nMarey accurately observed this. He wrote that when a seamew\ntakes off from the surface of the water, it first flaps its wings\nover a wide angle, at least 100 or 110 0 . Then, as it picks up\nspeed, the extent of its wingbeats is reduced and their amplitude\nfalls to 40\xc2\xb0. The bird often continues to fly like this for a long\ntime while skimming the water, neither gaining nor losing altitude\nand maintaining a perfect regularity in the beating of its wings.\nThe amplitude of birds\' wingbeats depends on the species, as\nthe following table shows. In this table, the angle given corresponds\nto the extreme positions occupied by the extended arm and forearm.\n\n151\n\n\t\n\nAmplitude\t\n\n(deg.)\t\nGriffon Vulture 40-60\t\nPeregrine Falcon 60-100\t\nOwl\t\n40-70\t\n\n\'\t\n\n.Amplitude\n\nSeamew\t\n\n(deg.)\n40-90\n\nPigeon\t\n\n40-80\n\nWild Duck\t\n\n80-100\n\nIt should be added that\t\namplitude is a function of a bird\'s\nspeed. The faster the animal goes, the smaller it is, but in any\ncase it never goes below 400.\nt\n\nIt may be concluded from the preceding numerical observations\t\nthht a wingbeat of small amplitude has as much effect in horizontal\nflight as a wingbeat of naximum amplitude in ascending flight. Lift\nis supplied just as well in the first case as in the second despite\nthe difference in energy produced by the bird.\nThis is solely because the bird has already attained such a high\nspeed in horizontal flight that a slight atmospheric counterforce\nsuffices to keep it aloft. Meanwhile, in ascending flight, the\nbird is taking off from the rest and is trying to gain both altitude\nand forward speed. It may thus be said that speed is advantageous\nto birds because it enables them to stay aloft with less effort.\nII. Win beat_rrequency\n\nNumerous observers have tried to measure how often birds flap\ntheir wings by counting the number of wingbeats made during a known\nperiod of time, which is made as long as possible. Such a method\ncannot be used to acquire a large body of data because it can only\nbe applied to species that beat their wings slowly and not at all\nto rapid flappers. It is impossible to count more than 10 wingbeats\nper second with the naked eye and is completely out of the question\nat frequencies of over 40 per second, as are attained by hummingbirds hovering above a.flower.\nTo achieve accurate results, it is indispensable to employ\nhigh-speed movie cameras to simultaneously photograph the beating of\nthe bird\'s wings, a network of coordinate lines, and also the\noscillators of a pendulum. All that is then necessary is to use\nenlargements to count the number of frames required for a complete\nwingbeat and to figure out the time taken up by one wingbeat by\nexamining the movement of the pendulum.\nHere is the average wingbeat frequency in midflight for a\nfew species of birds:\nflaps\n\nflaps\n\nGriffon Vulture\nPeregrine Falcon\nBuzzard\nWhite Stork\n\n152\n\nsec\n1-2\n4-5\n2-3\n1-2\n\nPigeon\nDuck\nSparrow\nWeaverbird\n\nsec\n3-6\n9-10\n12-14\n15-20\n\n111\n\nPelican\t\nHerring Gull\t\nSeamew\t\n\nflaps\t\nsec\t\n1-2\t\n2-3\t\n4-5\t\n\nflaks\nsec\nParakeet\t\n15-20\nGray Waxbill 16-20\nHummingbird 30-4.0\n\nWingbeat frequency changes according to flight circumstances,\njustlike amplitude. In oblique or completely vertical climbs, or\nwhile hovering, the number of beats is considerable, although the\nexact number depends on the species. In,contrast, during horizontal\nflight, the frequency is much smaller and the greater the speed\nthe more it is reduced. It should be pointed out, however, that in\nmidflight the wingbeat frequency also varies. If a bird is being\npursued, it increases the number of beats it makes to gain speed.\nSimilarly, if it has gained too much weight as a result of a large\nmeal, it also increases its flapping to :insure the proper amount of\nlift. furthermore, wingbeat frequency is immediately augmented if\nthe wing surface is reduced for any reason. This had already been\nnoticed thirty years ago by several writers.\nMouillard discovered that if the wing surface of a pigeon is\nincreased by grafting new long remiges to the barrels of severed\nnormal remiges, as falconers do, the animal\'s flight is markedly\nimpaired. Its normal flapping motions now appear to tire it.\nConversely, Mouillard reduced the depth of the wings of another\npigeon by cutting its remiges. This pigeon had a hard time generating anough lift to keep itself aloft in calm weather. However,\nit had no trouble at all when the wind was blowing.\nMarey once performed a different kind of experiment on some\nbirds whose wing motion he was trying to record. These animals\nwere loaded down with gradually increasing weights and the resulting\nincrease in wingbeat frequency and amplitude were observed. According to Marey, a buzzard could still fly with a load of 125 grams,\nwhereas a pigeon could only carry up to 60 grams.\nCertain experiments seem to indicate that it is the vertical\nthrust exerted by the air on the underside of a bird\'s wing that\ndetermines wingbeat frequency. As a ,natter of fact, Marey observed\nthat a bird slows down the frequency of its f lapping after it has\nreached a certain speed. A well developed muscular sense seems to\ninform the animal of the amount of lift furnished by air resistance.\nWhen resistance becomes excessive, it impedes the muscular effort\nproducing the downward stroke. The bird then delays its stroke\nuntil its diminishing speed reduces its lift to such an extent that\na new beat is called for.\nIII. Birds\' Speed\n\nThe speed of a bird in flight may be measured with a high\ndegree of precision by using a movie camera, a network of coordinate lines, and an oscillating pendulum.\n\n153\n\n112\n\nThe Calculation of a Bird\'s Distance with a Movie Camera\nThe reconstruction of a bird\'s trajectory, and consequently of\n\nits speed, is deduced from the following data:\na) Focal length of the objective;\nSize of the mesh;\nDistance fromithe network,\nwhich are constants of the apparatus.\n\nb) Actual dimensions of the bird;Dimensions of its filmed image,\nwhich give the distance of the bird from the objective.\nThis timed reconstruction directly yields the direction and\nmagnitude of the velocity.\nThe first result to deduce from an examination of the prints\nist,he distance of the bird from the camera gun. If an image of the\nbird located near the center of the coordinate network is examined,\nits distance D is given by the equation:\nD= d x L x rii\nm\t\n8\nwhere:\nd is the distance between the coordinate network and the camera \t\ngun;\n\n113\n\nL is the length of the bird;\nm is the length of the sides of the squares of the network;\nM I is the apparent length of one of these sides;\n& is the apparent length of the bird in the photograph.\nThere is a comment that should be made here. This concerns\nthe errors in measurement that can be made as a result of distortions\nof the coordinate network caused by perspective. This occurs when the\ncamera moves around its optical center.\n\ni\n\nWith the rotational mechanism previously described, different\nparts of the network are not at the same distance from the optical\ncenter. The squares on the edges are further away than the central\nsquares. They consequently appear on the film slightly deformed and\na little smaller. However, the formula for the amount of distortion\nis easy to obtain and, moreover, the corrections are very slight.\nCalculation of Birds\' Flight Speed with a Movie Camera\nThe path traversed by the center of gravity, from its first\nposition to its last, divided by the number of intervals, and then\nmultiplied by 16 (if the film was \xe2\x80\xa2taken. at 16 frames/sec) yields\n\ni\n154\n\nthe apparent speed u of a bird as seen in\nreal speed v in m/sec is then: v uL/6.\n\nthe enlargements. The\n\nIn the case of a bird in linear flight in zero wind, it is\nbest to make sure that the bird\'s trajectory and the network of\ncorrdinate lines are parallel. One could use a second camera gun\nperpendicular to the first for this purpose.. In practice, however,\nit is usually sufficient to examine the way in which the views of\nthe bird vary\n\nto\n\nverify the existence of parallelism.\n\nFigure 180\t\nApparatus for Measuring\t\na Bird\'s Speed\t\nP, Large Pulley; f, Thread\t\nF, Fiber; C, Copper\n\nFigure 181\nImpulses Produced by a Jaquet\nChronograph (above) and by an\nHoussay-Magnan .Apparatus (below)\n\nThe Houssay-Magnan Apparatus for Directly Measuring Birds\' Speed\nThere is another procedure for measuring a bird\'s speed in flight\nwhich uses an apparatus (figure 180) composed of a pulley mounted\nwith ball bearings on a horizontal axis. The framework supporting\nthe pulley itself rests on ball bearings and is moveable about a\nvertical axis-. Very fine, strong silk thread is rolled up around\nthe pulley. The free end of the thread is attached to a bird by a\nsystem of laces. The animal unrolls the thread as it flies and\n/114\nthe pulley\'s horizontal axis opens the contact of a Deprez signal \t\nrelay one time per revolution.

This is because birds seem to show a certain\nreluctance to fly under these conditions. Surprise or annoyance\ncaused by the unaccustomed situation in which they find themselves\nis enough to explain this attitude.\nMarey\'s Studies\n\nFirst of all, recall the figures given by previous authors\nobtained through direct observation,\nMarey, taking account of the facts already discussed, remarked\nfifty years ago that voyages by train sometimes provided the occasion\nto evaluate the speed of birds in flight. This occurred when the\nbirds flew parallel and ih the same direction as the train.\nThe same author recalled that at the time\t\npasserines were\neasily out distanced by express trains, whose normal rate of speed\nwas 18 m/sec. Crows also flew slower than railroad cars went.\nPigeons, however, accompanied them, and frequently passed them by.\nThe swallows flew even more quickly and the old-fashioned trains were\nno match at all for the swifts.\nMarey continued that the length of a trip accomplished in one\nstretch has been best determined for pigeons. He cited the obser\nvatons of various authors on this subject. According to Aldrovande,\none pigeon flew from Aleppo to Babylon, or 625 km, in 48 hours without traveling at night.\nA famous pigeon named Gladiator once made the trip from Toulouse\nto Versailles, 530 km, in 6.5 hours.\nOne of Henri II\'s falcons, lost during a hunt in the Forest of\nFontainebleau, was found the next day on the Isle of 114alta. It\nhad therefore flown 1,400 km in that period of time.\nFinally, according to a well known pigeon fancier, Van Rossenbecke,\nthe maximum speed of carrier pigeons is 25 leagues/hr. Furthermore,\nsuch birds could make the trip from Spa to Paris, a distance of 398\nkm, in 5 hours. This implies a speed of 80 km/hr or 22 m/sec.\nThe famous physiologist added that nothing is more variable than\nthe length of a bird\'s flight, which depends on various circumstances.\nCertain passerines, which generally make only short flights, fly\nacross oceans gathered in large flocks at considerable height, beyond\nthe range of the eye. The quail, which is rarely observed to fly more\nthan 300 meters at one time when it resides in our part of the globe,\ntravels very long distances during its migration.\nPersonal Studies\n\nHere are figures for some typical birds flying horizontally in\ncalm weather, which I obtained through the use of modern methods of\n\n\xc2\xb5 ,^\n\n156\n\nmeasurement. These figures, obtained by filmed observation, have\nan incontrovertible value. They represent the real speed of an\nanimal, at least at the moment when the film was made. It is certain\nthat they correspond to a flight in calm air since it was easy to\n\t\ncheck experimentally if there was a wind or not. The figures produced\nby timing the departure and arrival of a bird released at a chosen\npoint have less value because it isnot known if there was a significant wind at the altitude at which the bird was flying.\nSpeed of Horizontal Flapping Flight, in m/sec\nAlb atross .............15\n\nGiant Fulmar .......... 14\nHerring Gull.......... 15\nGriffon Vulture....... 17\nPeregrine Falcon ...... 28-30\nHouse Martin .......... 15-20\nSwift .................35-40\n\nCrow ..................10-12\nGoldfinch ............. 8-9\nSparrow ...............10\nStockdove .............22\nGray Partridge ........ 20\nCapercaillie .......... 15\nCurlew ................12-13\n\nIf a table were made of birds\' frequency of flapping, it would\nimmediately appear that the greatest speeds are incontrovertibly to\nbe found in specx.:is that beat their wings fairly rapidly. Birds that\nbeat their wings slowly, in contrast, fly at a slower speed.\non the other hand, if a pigeon is attached to a string and\nreleased, and if one pulls strongly enough on the strong to stop\nthe bird in midflight, the bird will first fall and then beat its\nwings very vigorously to reestablish sufficient lift.\nUp to here we have examined only the case of a bird flying,\nnear the ground in calm air. Actually, the wind plays an important\npart during flight. A moderate wind helps a bird a great deal both\nduring takeoff and in midflight. Certain species even take advantage\nof it to fly more quickly. These include quails during their migrations, carrier pigeons during their trips, and falcons during\ntheir hunts. In contrast, when the wind is too strong, numerous birds\nhave difficulty flying and often lose their bearings because of the\nskips they make in the air.\nIV. The Various Ways Birds Fly\n\nit now remains for us to examine the differences that exist\nin the ways in which various species fly.\nMarey had already pointed out how simple observation shows\n\nthat each group of birds has its own characteristic type of flight.\nEach type is difficult to define, but a trained eye recognizes it\nimmediately.\nWith the analytical means at our disposal, we can see that the\ndifferent types of flight are characterized in as clear a manner as\nanatomical forms, which is the feature that differentiates species\nof birds. There is nothing more fruitful to understanding the\nmechanism of flight than correlating anatomical and functional\ncharacteristics.\n157\n\n115\n\nTakeoff\nIt has been known for a long time that birds at rest have differing procedures for taking wing even though most of them first face the\nwind, when there is one, to acquire preliminary speed. To this\nend, some run along the ground (vultures, stork, buzzards, etc.) or\nthe surface of the water (albatrosses).\nOther birds,in-order to give their wings freedom of movement\nfrom the moment of ;liftoff, jump in the air- to a fairly great height\nin relation to their, size. Among these are the small waders, gallinaceaes, and passerines. Finally, there are some that drop down \t\nfrom an elevated perch. These include vultures, falcons, storks,\nand swifts.\nThe point of such runs, jumps, and falls is to provide the\ninitial speed necessary to generate a certain lift. The wings can\nthen take up the task.\nThese are known facts which, along with those that follow, I\nhave personally observed.\nThe Flight of Pal.mpeds\nThe majority of small-winged palmipeds, like ducks and auks,\nfly by rapidly beating their wings. I found the number of beats\nper second to range from 8 to 12, according to the species I was\nstudying. For these birds, flapping flight is continuous. They\nrarely stop striking the air with their wings when in flight, which\nis one of the most rapid. Some palmipeds, whose wings are a little\nmore developed than those of the ducks (e.g., swans, geese, and\ncormorans) progress by flapping their wings at a slightly lower\nfrequency. They are capable of keeping their wings extended and\nmotionless and of traveling a certain distance thanks to their\nacquired speed. Others, adapted mere or less completely to an\naquatic life, fly only rarely. These include grebes, loons, and\nparticularly penguins.\nThe Flight of Gallinaceae\nAlmost all gallinaceae fly in a similar manner to geese. After\na series of precipitous, rapid wingbeats, averaging about a dozen\nper second they build up speed and fly off, flapping their wings\nrepeatedly (figure 182). Every once in a while, they stop flapping\nand completely unfold their motionless wings. As they move forward\nin this position, they execute a true glide, which never lasts more\nthan a short period of time (figure 183).\nThe Flight of_,Columbidae\nThe mode of flight of columbidae, or pigeons, is a little different.\nThese birds flap at a fairly rapid rate, 3 to 6 times per second, on\n\nr\t\n\n158\n\n116\n\nthe average. They are also capable of gliding with their wings extended between two series of wingbeats. However, when they have attained\nsufficient speed, they can also fly with motionless flexed wings,\nwhich the gallinacea are basically incapable of. With the elbow\nslightly bent and the wing tips clearly thrust rearward, as is illustrated in figure 184, they considerably reduce their airfoil and ahoot\noff through the air without losing much altitude. Their speed can\nbe as high as 120 km/hr, while during flapping flight their speed\nvaries between 80 and 90 km/hr.\n\nT\n\nT\n\nI.^\n\nFigure 182\nRed Grouse in Midflight\n\nThe Flight of Small Waders\nSmall waders fly through the air in an analogous fashion.\nBetween periods of flapping at the rate of 5 to 10 beats/sec, they\ndrift through the air pointing their wing tips rearward (figure 185).\nTheir speed is highly variable. For the larger species it is\n60 km/hr. It can even surpass 100 km/hr in smaller species such as\nplovers. Some waders well adapted to aquatic lie, such as the\ncoot, hardly ever take wing. When they do, their flights are always\nof short duration.\nThe Flight of Swifts\n\nother birds, such as swifts and swallows, usually fly exclusively\nby flapping their wings, with a frequency of 8 per second for the\nformer and 3 to 4 per second for the latter. However, at times\nthey do accomplish fairly long elides, thanks to their more developed\n\n159\n\n117 j\n\n\t\n\nairfoils. They are numbered amongst the most rapid of the flying\nvertebrates.\n\nlzr\nr\n^ fu,\n\nNz^o\n-\n\n\t\n\tFiqure\n183\n\t\nGrouse\'s Position\n\t\nwhen Gliding\n\nFigure 184\nWood Pigeon Flying off at\nGreat Speed with Winqs\n\nBent, Ventral View\n\nc\t\n\n^\t\n\n,\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2,^rsc_ ti \xe2\x80\xa2 \'\n\nFigure 185\nRuff Gliding with\nWings Bent\n\nPiqure 186\nGreenfinch Driftin g with its\nWings Folded against its\nBody, Ventral View\n\nThe Fli q ht of Small Passerines\nThe small passerines have a particular mode of flying, consisting of a period of rapid flapping followed by a period in which\nthe wings are at rest. In the first period they progress as long\nas their wings strike the air, which is at a frequency of 8 to 20\nbeats/sec. Their trajectory follov , s an inclined ascending line.\nThen, when they think their speed is sufficient, they cease rowing,\n\n160\n\n/118\n\nI\n\nfold their wings up against their bodies (figure 186), and shoot\nthrough the air like an arrow, while simultaneously losing altitude.\nTheir airfoil is not, however, reduced to zero at this time. It\nis six times smaller than during flapping flight itself. It thus\nonly serves to balance the body until the moment when its decreasing\nspeed obliges the animal to flap its wings so as not to fall. If\na comparison can be used., the bird is hurtling through the air like\na projectile and its trajectory obeys the laws of ballistics.\nThis is how the majority of small passerines fly. Their motion\nin the air is an undulated line of variable amplitude (figure 187).\n\nit is formed of inclined ascents during periods of flapping and of\ninclined falls when the wings are closed up.\nSome passerines, such as orioles, are able to glide for a\ncertain length of time because of their fairly well developed wing\nsurface. They constitute a transition between species whose flight\nis undulated and the corvids, which beat their wings only 2 to 3\ntimes per second. These latter birds are capable of gliding for a\ncertain length of time with their large wings open.\nOther passerines, such as the titmouse, the sedge warbler, the\nwoodpecker, and the wryneck, can accomplish only short, unsustained,\nabrupt flights because their habitat is located in trees or reeds\nand the faculty of flight has become much less developed in them.\nThey do not usually fly for very long and most commonly only leave\na tree or a reed to late onto another one. The ability to fly has\njust about disappeared in the wrens, which live almost continuously\nin the brush and whose flight is accomplished only with great effort,\nand in the wall\'creepers : ,who fly in jumps like butterflies while going\nfrom one wall to another.\nLastly, I should add that the speed of the passerines is never\ngreat. The best fliers among them barely exceed 50 km/hr.\n\n3\n,Lnr ,n M ,v.r.-n,t a.\n\nFigure 187\nUndulated Trajectory of a\nPasserine (from Oehmichen)\n\nFigure 188\nTrajectory of\na Falcon (from Huber)\n\nKey: a) Direction of movement\n\n161\n\nThe Flight of Raptors\nAmong diurnal: raptors, the group composed of the falcons reveals\nin flapping flight. Falcons rise up against \t\nthe wind by flapping repeatedly. The number of flaps varies from 3 to\n4 for the peregrine falcons to 5 or 6 for the hobby, whose flight is\nsimilar to that of the swift.\n\na remarkable virtuosity\n\nThey ascend, for example when they are pursuing a prey, at an\nangle of 15 to 20 0 with the horizon. This visibly requires great\neffort on the falcons\' part. They are frequently obliged to\ninterrupt their ascents and fly off almost horizontally in the\ndirection of the wind. They thus end up directly above their point\nof departure without suffering a net loss in altitude. (See figure\n188.)\nAfter a falcon has zig-zagged to a sufficient height, it folds\nits wings up against its body and swoops down upon its prey at a\ndizzying speed. The falcons, particularly the kestrels, are\ncapable of gliding in a remarkable fashion. The same is true of\nthe goshawks and the sparrowhawks, moreover, whose mode of flight\nis similar to theirs. This group of birds of prey ranks among the\nmost rapid birds.\nConcerning the hobbies, I have seen them fly at speeds of more\nthan 100 km/hr during horizontal flapping flight.\nThe Flight of Large Gliders\nLastly, in addition to the majority of birds of prey, whether\ndiurnal (vultures, eagles, buzzards) or nocturnal, such as the large\nwinged palmipeds (albatrosses, sea gulls, gannets) and certain\nwaders (cranes, storks, herons, marabout,), there are other groups\npossessing a large wing surface that perform rowing flight. Some\ndo it only exceptionally, others more frequently. The number of\nwingbeats is always reduced to 2 or 3 per second, with fairly long\nseparations between series of beats. Such long separations exist\nbecause these birds most often either glide with their wings open\nfor considerable periods or else flex their wings rearward and fly\noff at a higher rate of speed. In the latter case, their displacement in space is more rapid than in the former. While the average\nspeed is on the order of 40 km/hr, a speed of 50 to 60 km/hr can be\nattained when the wings are flexed.\nIn the course of the present study of flapping flighte I have\nonly considered the wing surface and its movements. There is another\norgan that plays an importart role in the rowers. This is the\ntail, which represents, contrary to what certain authors such as\nHouillard think, a true tiller governing both depth and direction.\nIn rowing flight, the tail is constantly folded up, except at\ndeparture and during ascents, descents preceding arrival, and\nturning movements. When moving forward horizontally, the tail\'s\n162\n\n119\n\nsurface is always reduced to a minimum.\nI have not dwelt on how a bird in flight changes direction,\neither. Generally, a right turn (for example) in midflight is\nperformed by beating the left wing more broadly. A descent in the\nmidst of a turn is accomplished by tucking in one wing while\nextending the other. The bird thus pivots around the tucked -in wing.\nIt can be seen from this report which perhaps merited a fuller\ndevelopment, that variations exist-in birds\' rowing and gliding\nability. However, there is in fact no reason to separate rowing\nfrom gliding flight, as has been dons up to now. They are actually\ntwo phases of a single mode of airborne locomotion. Which of these\nphases is more often used by an animal in flight depends on its\n\nconformation\n\nand, consequently, on its aeronautical characteristics.\n\nV. Glidin q Fliqht\nGliding flight, whatever its duration, should not be confused\nwith soaring flight. During gliding flight, a bird of prey, for\nexample, extends its wings at right angles to the axis of its body\nand drifts through the air or describes successive circles, always \t\nwhile losing altitude. It performs this flight even in calm air.\nGliding birds behave like an airplane with a large airfoil which,\nwith its engine shut off, descends slowly along a path whose\ninclination depends on its characteristics and profile. The work\nnecessary for lifting and moving a bird in rowing flight is provided\nby flapping its wings. When flapping stops, lift is provided in\ncircumstances varying with the magnitude of the wing surface.\nHowever, descent begins along a trajectory whose inclination depends\non the aerodynamic efficiency of the bird.\nHere is what Painleve wrote on the subject of gliding flight:\n"The various types of flight made in the absence of\nwingbeats seemed for a long time to be inexplicable because a persistant, serious error was distorting the laws\nof gliding. More precisely, air resistance encountered by\na moving thin plane was considerably underestimated. Let\nus imagine a model glider consisting of a solid plate, whose\nthickness and surface roughness we will assume is negligible.\n\'Suppose that this plate falls vertically in still air\nwhile remaining horizontal. It encounters a resistance\noriginating in the fluid. This resistance is directed vertically upwards and has been found to be basically proportional to the square of the speed of descent. For example,\nif at a speed of 1 m/sec, the air resistance impeding the\nplate is 1 kg, at 5 m/sec the resistance will be 25 kg. If\nthe plate also weighs 25 kg, air resistance will balance\nthe weight of the plate as soon as the speed of descent reaches\n5 m/sec, and the plate, no matter how far it falls, will remain at this speed.\n\n163\n\n120\n\n":iowever, suppose that the plate (still in a horizontal position) is controlled so as to descend at an\nangle. It will then have both a horizontal and a vertical\n\nspeed at the same time.\n"Air resistance will always be perpendicular to the\n(perfectly smooth) plate. It is therefore vertical and\ndirected upwards. However, some simplistic, valueless\'\nreasoning has caused it to be assumed since Newton that\nthe resistance is completely independent of the horizontal speed. It supposedly depends only on the vertical\nspeed of descent, and is proportional to its square.\n\n"If such a law were correct, the phenomenon of\ngliding would not exist. By this I mean that the angle\nof the fall would not be a factor in attenuating the\nvertical speed. In the numerical example chosen above,\nthe plate would still arrive on the ground with a speed\nof 5 m/sec, as in the case of a vertical fall.\n""However, this law is in complete contradiction with\nexperience. It has been found that, on the contrary,\nfor very oblique descents, air resistance is proportional\nnot to the square of the vertical speed, but simultaneously\nto both the vertical and horizontal speeds. The air\nresistance corresponding to a very low rate of vertical\nspeed could counterbalance the weight if the horizontal\nspeed is great enough. Thus, in the preceding numerical.\nexample, the weight and air resistance would be in\nequilibrium if the glider had a horizontal speed of 25\nm/sec and a vertical speed of only 1 m/sec.\n"In. relation to this, let us consider a bird that\nis released at an appropriate height in still air.\nAfter dropping briefly, it will descend with its wings\nhorizontal and motionless along a straight line with a\nspeed and inclination depending on the manner in which\nit chooses to control its fall. if a bird were really\ncomparable to the infinitely thin and perfectly smooth\nmodel glider, it could make its vertical speed be as\nsmall as it desired. In reality, because of the thickness of its body and of friction, the plane of its wings\nhas to lean slightly forward during glided descent\ninstead of being horizontal. No matter how agilely the\nbird maneuvers, the slope of the fail cannot be reduced\nbelow a certain limit, no more than its vertical speed\ncan be. This limit characterizes the aerodynamic\nefficiency of the glider made up of the bird and its\noutstretched wings. The lower the limit is, the closer\nthe bird approaches the model glider and the more\nremarkable is its efficiency."\nIn addition to what is properly called gliding flight,\nthere exists another sort of flight also, but incorrectly,\ncalled gliding by some people. This is soaring. It may be\n164\n\n/121\n\nconsidered that soarers glide, but they do not lose altitude; in\nfact, they gain it at every instant. Even so, they do not develop\nany propulsive force with their muscles. In this sense they do\nnot beat their wings for considerable lengths of time. However,\nmuscular work still occurs, as we will see below.\n\nRECOMMENDED READING\nHuber, Observations sur le Vol des oiseaux de proie (observations\n\non the Flight of Birds of Prey],, Geneva\nMagnan, A.

They have been able to further specify that, by\nmeans of soaring, large birds are usually able to transport them-\n\nselves in any direction supported by their rigid, immobile wings.\nSoaring birds can also make great circles in the air, rise to great\n\nheights, and even more forward, sometimes climbing, sometimes\nfalling through the air,for long hours without flapping once.\nAt a time when observation was the only means available, some\nnaturalists tried to discover the basis for soaring in the con$titution of the bird itself. However, more curious spirits did not\ntake long to notice that there was an obvious correlation between\nsoaring and the presence of wind. From this moment on, the wind\nbecame the starting point for theories on this mode of flight.\nSuch theories are innumerable, moreover, and I shall not analyze\nthem here. I will instead limit myself to explanations arising from\ncurrent experimental research.\nIt has often been written that soaring birds occupy only a\nsmall portion of the globe and that this was the reason it was so\ndifficult to study soaring and to describe with certainty the\nmaneuvers executed by the species performing this kind of flight.\nContrary to this baseless assertion, soaring birds could be found\nThis includes\neverywhere if it were not for faulty observation. \t\non land just as well as at sea, and cold regions as well as temperate\nand tropical ones. If these birds\' activity is not observed more\nfrequently, it is because people do not go to the places where they\nare found. In the same way as there are points on the globe where\nhumans do not live, there are spots where soarers do not live. This\nthe lack of favorable winds makes it impossible\nis not because\t\nfor them to fly in these localities. Rather, they cannot find the\nliving conditions or food required for their survival.\nIn order to see soarers engage in their favorite form of flight,\none must go to the regions where they are well established. Even\nthen, it is necessary to observe the birds of these regions\nin flight attentively in order to be able to distinguish true\nsoaring. Many people have hatched sea gulls alone coastal cliffs,\nfor instance, without suspecting that these palmipeds were simply\nperforming feats of soaring\nAll one has to do is to walk along the coast anywhere between\nLe Havre and Calais, especially in autumn and winter, i.e. outside\nParticularly if\nof the breeding season, to find the common gull.\t\nthere is a wind, it can be seen balancing gracefully in the air and\ndrifting above the edges of cliffs for long periods,practically\nwithout moving its wings.\n\n167\n\n\t\n\nI have many times had the chance to study soaring birds during\nmy travels. I have not been content just to observe soaring in\norder to describe in detail the maneuvers involved or to note \t\nthe changes in shape that the wings and,the tail undergo,. 2 not\nonly sought to become acquainted with how soaring flight xanfolds,\nto ascertain its characteristic movements and the actual sequence\nof such movements, I have also attempted to determined, with the\naid of the appropriate instruments, the nature of the winds in\nwhich soarers maneuver. In addition, I have tried to measure\nsoaring birds\' forward and ascending speed, the diameter of the\ncircles they make in the sky, the height to which they climb, and\ntheir angle of descent.\n\n/123\n\nA theodolite with a micrometric sight could be used to collect\nthe necessary information, as I have done formerly. However, it\nis preferable to make use of a movie camera or even the camera\ngun and coordinate network set up about which we have spoken previously.\nIf the average wingspread or body length, which vary little from\nindividual to individual, is also known, it is possible to make a\ngood enough approximation by measuring successive film enlargements\nof the distance of the bird from the objective, its height above\nthe ground, the trajectory it describes in the air, and its horizontal and ascending speed.\nI. Soaring in Ascending Obstruction Currents\n\nThe characteristics of the wind in which a bird maneuvers\ncan be determined, although it is not always easy, with such\ninstruments as hot wire instruments, sounding balloons, and smoke\napparatus, which have been described previously. I have thus\nobserved that the layers of wind that strike a cliff, especially\nfrontally, are forcefully rejected upward. This has the effect of\ncreating an ascending current whose area of greatest intensity is\nlocated in front of the upper edge of the cliffs, as has already\nbeen seen.\n\nThe Flight of Sea Gulls\n`\t\n\n\'t\n\nIt is in this zone that common gulls are seen along the cliffs\nof the English Channel. Some, their wings almost completely\nextended and thier beaks pointed forward, mount up almost vertically\nin the air. First their climb is rapid, then it slows down as they\nrise from in front of the edge of the cliff to a variable height\nabove it. Their speed, which is at first 1 m/sec in a wind. of 10\nmeters, is reduced little by little and ends up having a value of\nonly a few centimeters. The gulls thus in certain cases attain a\nfixed altitude which they hold to as if stuck to the sky. They\nthen slip through the air in the direction from which the wind blows,\nas if they were sliding down the slope of the layers of air obstructed by the cliff. They thus return \'to the most favorable zone of\nthe ascending current to start the cycle anew.\n\n168\n\nDuring their ascents, sea gulls do not flap their wings at all,\nin the true \xe2\x96\xbaneaning of the term. They merely influence the air flow;\nsometimes on one side, sometimes on the other, by lowering the hand\ns r\tof their wings as required to reestablish their balance.\nT.\t\n_,veering is sometimes so great that the han(\' wing in action\nappears to abruptly make a 90\xc2\xb0 angle with the re:It of the wing. (See\nfi g ure 189.) The result of this special maneuver is a sort of\nlateral balancing of the bird, comparable to that of a tightrope\n\nwalker.\n\n\xe2\x96\xba ..,\n\n1,.., a\t\n\na\nrI ^ A,\n\n+\t\n^ /^\t\n\n\'\n\nN ^JI IIr\n\nb\n\n7\n\n\t\nFigure 189\n\t\nSea Gull Lowering its\n\t\nLeft Hand Wing to\nReestablish Equilibrium\n\nFigurr 190\nManeuvers of a Difting\nSea Gull\n\nKey: a) Wind\nb) Direction of bird\nNot only can sea gulls move vertu--ally in a zone of ascending\ncurrent, they can also move horizontally.\nTo do this, they tack against the wind to maintain the right\nheight and they maneuver in such a way as to follow the top of the\ncliff. They face the wind and strive to keep their beaks constantly\nfacing the wind. Their bodies are slightly tipped, with the long\naxis directly downward. They then fly sideways along the cliff and\ncontinuously manipulate their tails so as to follow a path almost\nparallel to the upper edge of the cliff.\nTo achieve this, they direct the axis of their bodies so that\nthe front part is pointed to the right if they are moving rightward (figure 190) or to the left if they are moving leftward. In\naddition, the sea gull never changes direction by banking. Jt finds\nit sufficient to alter the orientation of the axis of its body when\nit wants to change course. Its speed in these circumstances can be\nas high as 20 m/sec. On the average, it oscillates between 10 and\n12 m/sec.\nIn contrast, once the wind dies down, the sea qull begins to\ndescend. It now has only one way to stop falling. This is to beat\n169\n\n/124\n\nits wings.\nIt can be stated that all sea birds are able to take advantage\nof rising obstruction currents. Those that nest on steep rocks,\nlike the gannets at Saint Kilda or certain wandering albatrosses\nat Tristan da Cunha, know how to utilize such winds to gain altitude.\n\n1\n1\t\n\n5\n\n!\t\n\n1\n\nr\n\nFigure 191\nCircular Flight of an Eagle\nin a Rising Mountain Current\n\nFigure 192\nPath of a. Buzzard Soaring\nin a Rising Current Existing\nbefore and behind Cliffs\n\nKey: a) Wind\nThe Flight of Eagles\nThe truth is that a rising current is a source of soaring and\nis at the origin of some of these flights. Many birds readily use\nthem every time they have the chance, in order to facilitate their\nflight. Some even devote themselves to soaring by means of rising\nwinds, perhaps in preference to any other.\nSuch is the case for many raptors. Thus, they are encountered\nin localities where the conditions necessary for soaring in rising\nwinds are found. This is in areas where either vertical or\nsteep cliffs or mountains with sharp precipices exist in addition\n/125\nto regular, or at least frequent, propitious rising currents. The \t\nmore the terrain is uneven and the wind is regular but not too strong,\nthe more the air-is filled with soaring raptors. They can be\nseen climbing to great altitudes and making large circles in the\n\nair (figure 191)\n\n170\np^\n!\n`ti a\t\n\n-\t\n\n. -.\n\nEagles use rising currents in other localities besides mountainous regions. Particularly in Soctland, they can be found at the\nedge of forests where there are deer, which they seek to make their\nprey. In sections where the wind has a high enough vertical\ncomponent, they hold their wings greatly spread out. The large\nremiges are distinctly separated and even turned slightly upward,\nespecially at the tips.\nIn the hilly regions of Europe, other species of birds exist\nthat soar by making use of rising currents. Spain and Sardinia\nare still inhabited at the present time by bearded vultures whose\nflight appears less graceful than that of eagles and seems slower,\nin general. They can tae seen gliding in rising currents, sometimes\nflying in circles when the currents occupy only a small area.\nThe Flight of Buzzards\n\nI have frequently witnessed buzzards flying over greatly protruding terrain in the Vosges. They fly upwards on the windward\nside of a summit and, in a wind of 6 m/sec, make successive\ncircles up to 100 meters above the crest. They then start to glide\nto reach another peak and begin to gain altitude again in spots\nwhere there are rising currents.\nI once saw a buzzard circling above the lee slope of a hill\nseparated by a large valley from another hill (figure 192). One\nwould think that at this location the layers of air would possess\na descending component. I realized that on the contrary, there was\nan ascending current along the lee slope whose speed attained 7\nm/sec at the summit of the protrusion. At this point, it joined\nup with the rising current formed on the windward slope. The\nexceptional leeward rising current was due to eddies engendered\nbehind the hill. It rose as it followed the lee slope and then\nreinforced the normal rising current.\nThe circles made by buzzards barely reach 20 meters in diameter.\nThey are completed in 8 to 9 seconds, which iirnlies a speed of 7 or\n7.50 m/sec. Buzzards soar even in relatively weak winds. I\nhave seen them climb to 100 meters in front of a forest struck by\na wind of 4 m/sec .\nAs a matter of fact, a simple curtain of trees suffices to\nproduce a rising current which kestrels, for instance, know how to\ntake advantage of for stationary flights several meters above the\ntops of the trees. In a wind of 5 meters, these small raptors can\nmaintain an almost immobile position facing the wind. Their wings\ndo not flap at 11. Their only motion is a slight lateral balancing\nto counteract momentary disequilibria.\nThe Flight of Condo rs\n\nIt is also interesting to note that there are soaring birds able\nto use wind reflected from obstacles on all continents. it can even\n171\n1\n\nF\n\nbe stated that everywhere on earth that windy stretches of uneven\nground are found, it is certain that soarers will be encountered, so\nlong as the conditions for their continued survival are present.\nIn the Andes of South America, there are gigantic walls that\ngive rise to very strong rising currents. The condors there take\nadvantage of such currents for both soaring and moving about.\n\n/126\n\nThe condors nest at an altitude of 3 or 4,000 meters. They\ntherefore usually soar at very great heights, making circles of more\nthan 60 meters in diameter with their heads in constant motion.\nTheir flight tends to be very slow. According to the observations\nthat I have come across, it seems that their speed is less than\n12 m /sec. Condors do not live only in the hL_;..i mountains of the\nAndes. They are also found along the coast, at locations where high\ncliffs create rising currents favorable to soaring.\n\nM\n\nq\n\nFigure 193\nSea Gulls Soaring in a Rising Current behind a Moving Ship\nFlight Behind Ships\nSea gulls also receive lift from rising obstruction currents when,as if suspended above the prow of a ship by a magic wire,\n\nthey keep their balance without noving their extended wings as they\naccompany boats (figure 193). The rising currents are here due\nto disturbances created behind a ship by mas ses of air displaced by\nits forward motion.\nFlight Above Waves\nSea birds also soar with the help of rising currents arising\nwhen the wind encounters a swell. Certain species seem to have\nparticularly specialized in this kind of flight. Remaining constantly\nfar out at sea, marine palmipeds cross oceans by flying above the waves,\nwhen there is a wind, practically without resting.\nIn the course of their airborne circuits, such marine soarers\nmake use of the rising currents produced when horizontal wind comes\nup aginst slower moving waves or when wave motion occurs in gentle\n\n172\n\nor nonexistent wind. The rising current can thus be locatea ei.tner_;\non the windward or leeward wide of waves.\n/127\nSuch is the case of the Cory\'s shearwater, which is found only \t\non the high seas, particularly between Corsica and the Balearic\nIslands. It lands on the coast only during breeding season.\nWhen the wind is still, the Cory\'s shearwatet is difficult to\ncatch sight of during a. Mediterranean cruise because it is floating\non the water and stays far from ships. However, as soon as the wind \t\nrises and produces breakers on the surface of the sea, the shear- \t\nwater springs from the surface of the waves by beating them with its\nfeet and tail. Its speed increases little by little and soon, like\na seaplane, it leaves the water and starts to soar. It then climbs\nto a height of between 1/2 and 1 meter above the windward slope of\nthe wave. This is the point where experience has shown that the air\ncurrent has the greatest rising component. The shearwater\'s flight\nalmost always takes place parallel to the crest of the wave and\nalmost always at the same distance away from it. The shearwater\nmost commonly faces the wind and its wings are spread out at a right\nangle to its body. It therefore flies sideways at the same time as\nforward. This allows it to remain in the rising current\'s most\npropitious zone, which constantly changes position as the wave advances. The shearwater then glides between two waves and catches up\nwith another crest along which it moves.

Soaring in Rising Thermal Currents\nSoaring birds are also encountered in regions where rising\nobstruction currents are less common, for example in warm regions\nand deserts. I have experimentally observed that the soaring birds\nof these areas ascend in zones where there are rising thermal currents\nsuff icient to lif t them. Among such soarers, let me cite the vultures,\nkites, eagles, pelicans, and the adjutant cranes and marabous.\nIn the course of a day, numerous soarers, vultures and kites,\ncan be seen in these zones. They climb through the air with their\nwings and tail spread wide while making successive circles. They\nthus remain within the most propitious region and can attain very\nhigh altitudes.\nFrom their high point, they slip down through the air. As\nthey cross beaches where the ;;...irent is descending, they follow a\nstraight, inclined path downv)v \'\xe2\x80\x94 s until they reach a new column of\nrising air. (See figure 196.)\n.). I/cn/\n\na\n\n1\n\nFigure 196\nPath of Vultures Soaring in Rising Thermal Currents\nKey: a) Wind\nThe Flight of Vultures\nIn the course of my travels in North Africa, I have often\nstudied the flight of griffon vultures. These birds particularly\ninhabit deserts. They need to glide high up in the air to insure\ntheir survival because they live chiefly off the carcasses of dead\nanimals, which are not to be found just anywhere. They climb to\ngreat heights to discover their prey with the aid. of their sensitive\neyesight.\n\n174\n\n/128\n\nIn his time, Mouillard considered vultures as the archetypal\nsoarers. He did not separate them from marine soaring birds in regard\nto their manner of using the wind. This was true even though he\nrecognized that the former were wide- winged slow gliders while the:\nlatter constituted a family of narrow-winged soarers. He also knew\nthat vultures are not designed to move in rapid air currents, although\nsuch speeds are perfectly acceptable to other families of skilled\nflyers.\nGriffon vultures have one of the most characteristic ways of\nflying. My observations in North Africa have led me to some very\ndefinite conclusions. Since 1906 I have noticed that soaring does\nnot begin in arid regions until a specific hour, around 8 or 9\no\'clock in the morning, according to the season.\nOn several occasions, I was able to get a good view of how\nvultures set about leaving the ground. They have to make a considerable effort, even when they are not stuffed with food and are\nreduced to taking off from the sand by running a variable distance\nand using their wings to assist them. After a certain distance,\nthe feet leave the ground more and more and the flapping of the wings\nbecomes more precise. Then, they begin to ascend while beating their\nwings at a rate of 2 or 3 times per second. The flapping shows down\ntwenty meters from the ground and at 50 or 60 meters it almost\nceases, when the bird has achieved the necessary support. Vultures\nthen circle into the sky, but it is not until 100 meters above the\nsand that their flight takes on the majesty characteristic of them.\nAt this point, flapping has stopped completely. The slow ascent is\ncontinued up to more than 1000 meters. The circling bird holds its\ninside wing a lot lower than the other. The resulting inclination\nof the bird about its horizontal axis seems to be invariable. The\ngriffon vulture keeps its tail spread wide and sometimes inclined in\nrelation to its major axis. Its wings are v-shaped in both the\nhorizontal and vertical planes.\nWhen gliding at constant altitude, the wings are in a horizontal\nplane passing through their points of attachment to the body (figure\n197). However, when circling, the two wing tips are elevated above\nthe horizontal plane (figure 198). The wing in this case has an\nelevated dihedral, according to the term used in aviation. The\nangle thus formed is approximately 170\xc2\xb0. This arrangement of its\nairfoils gives the bird a certain transverse stability.\n\nFigure 197\nSilhouettes of a Griffon Vulture when Gliding,\nFrontal and Lateral Views\n\n175\n\n/1.29\n\nFigure 198\nSilhouettes of a Griffon Vulture when Soaring in Circles,\nFrontal and Lateral Views\n\nFigure 199\nSilhouettes of a Griffon Vulture Soaring with Flexed Wings\nFrontal and Lateral Views\nIn simple gliding, the major axis of the vulture\'s wing is most\noften perpendicular to the vertical plane passing throuch the longitudinal axis of the bird. When circling, the wing ti p s are thrust\nforward so that the straight line passing thro:gh them also passes\nnear the animal\'s beak (figure 200). In fact, th o y form a new dihedral angle in a plane that is virtually horizontal. The angle\nmeasures approximately 160\xc2\xb0.\n\n"ice\t\n\n... \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x96\xba\n\n^- \xe2\x99\xa6:...\t\n\nrr\t\n\n^^ f^\',..^4.r^^!`\t\n\n^\' ^.\n"^ {\n\n^!rr\n\n4LI1,\n\nFigure 200\nWing Configuration of a Griffon Vulture\nLeft: Soaring in Circles; Center: Soaring with Flexed Wings\nRight: Gliding with Very Flexed Wings\nThe result of such an arrangement is that the wing\'s center of\nthrust passes to the front of the bird\'s center of gravity, thus\ncreating a torque that tends to elevate the front of the bird (figure\n198). That is actually what happens, for a vulture ascending in\ncircles does in fact have its body tilted slightly upward.\nHowever, this does not mean that the wings remain motionless\nduring the entire ascent. The re , niges of the hand wing fan out and\nare often separated by a space equal to five widths of the large\nquills. In addition, the remiges are twisted upward and in certain\nconditions their tips noticeably vibrate. These vibrations are passive\nand depend upon the vibrations of the air current itse=lf.\n\n176\n\nThe tail, which is also most often fanned out, provides all\nnecessary steering corrections during this period.\nAn examination of films of vultures in, flight has revealed that\nthey complete an entire circle of 50 meters in diameter (figure\n201) in 13 to 15 seconds. Their flight speed is therefore 10 to\n11.5 m/sec. When there is no horizontal wind or only a weak one,\nwhich does not occur very often in the countries that.I\n\nvisited, the ascent of the birds is slow. It has a very gentle\nslope and hardly exceeds 1-meter with each circle.\n\nWind\n\nFigure 201\ncircles Described by Soaring Golden.Vultures, with Time in Seconds\n(from Hankin)\nWhen the wind is blowing at the same time as the air has been\nheated up and is rising, there is a marked ascent of the horizontal\nwind where it intersects zones of thermal currents. As I have already\nindicated, these zones are stretched into columns with an elliptical\ncross section. Their major axis, which is sometimes several kilometers\nlong, is parallel to the direction of the wind. In such zones, vultures /130\nfly with ease. They follow linear trajectories and advance against\nthe wind at a speed depending on that of the air current encountered.\nThis last mode of flight is characterized by a flexing of the\nwings, and the ends of the large remiges are now pointed toward the\ntail (figure 200). The wings no longer form a dihedral, but are\nnot flat, either. They have a double curvature, which gives the\nsoaring bird the appear.nce of a circumflex accent or a U when viewed\nfrom in front (figure 199).\nOne of the first things that one notices when observing flexed\nwing flight is that a bird\'s speed increases as the amount its\nwings are flexed increases.\nWhat is more, this mode of flight is carried out by vultures\nover gr6at distances without any noticeable change in general direction,\nloss of altitude, or wing movement.\t\nWhat we have just said about the griffon vulture can be applied\n\n177\n\np\n\nto all the others. They all soar in the same way, by means of\nrising thermal currents, including the condors.\nEgyptian, turkey, and black vultures (figure 202) fly through\nthe air in a similar fashion. The hooded vulture of central Africa\nhas a flight that resembles that of the griffon vulture, even though\nit is of smaller size. Idrac made a careful study of this bird and\nalso of the kite in Senegal. He noticed that the hooded vulture\ncircles in areas where the wind has an ascending component and that\nin these areas there was always a high density of birds. He found\nthat the speed of the kite was 7 m/sec and that of the hooded vulture\nwas 8 m/sec.\nThe Flight of Kites _\n\nThe kites seen frequently in North Africa are some of the best\nsoarers, like their cousins in India, Their flight is more varied\nand\t\ndemonstrates a remarkable agility in the air. They closely\nresembles the true soarers in the sense that they do not flap .their\nwings at all for considerable periods of time.\nKites perform very graceful circling flights in the morning, as /131\nsoon as the sun begins to send out its rays, and especially when there\nis a light wind. They first make an inclined takeoff using flapping\nflight. They then start to circle around, sometimes with their wings\nwell extended and the tips pointed slightly forward, sometimes by\nrowing slowly in the part of their circuit where they are facing the\nwind. Later, they stop flapping altogether and they climb into the\nsky with an astonishing slowness, regularity, and stability.\n\nAt this moment their soaring ability truly equals that of the\ngriffon vultures. Their wings are absolutely motionless. Changes\nin direction are made by inclining the wings. Only the tail is in\ncontinual movement, for purposes of banking.\nEven though it makes no effort to propel itself, the kite gains\naltitude with each circuit. The increase in altitude is obviously\nmade in the part of the circle in which the bird is facing the wind.\nHowever, the flight of the kite is differentiated from that of the\nvulture in that as it climbs the kite is clearly carried along by the\nwind to an increasing degree as the wind\'s strength increases. (See\nfigure 203). The kite makes circles about 20 meters in diameter.\nThe centers of the different circles are located on a line following\nthe direction of the land and are distant from each other by 2 to 6\nmeters. Since each circle is completed in 8 to 9 seconds, the\nflight speed varies from 6.50 to 7.50 m/sec.\nWhenever kites circle, they are in a cylindrical or elliptical\nzone having an ascending component.\n\n178\n\n.ice\n\nFigure 202\nFilm of a Black Vulture (Catharist atrata Bartr.) in Flight_\nCircling in Rising Thermal Currents without Beating its Wings\n(Film by Idrac) 16 Frames a Second (Read from Top to Bottom\nand from Left to Riaht)\n\n179\n\n8 m/s Wind\n\nFigure 203\nPath of a Circling Kite Carried Along by Rising Thermal Currents\n(from Hankin)\nThe Flight of Marabous and Pelicans\n\nThe pouched marabou that is found in great numbers in Africa is,\ndespite the ridiculous form that it presents on the ground, one of\nthe kings of soaring. Its style of flight resembles that of the\ngriffon vulture. As a matter of fact, the two are frequently seen\ntogether as they both are lovers of carrion. When the marabou takes\nwind in a wind of a to 6 m/sec, it first rases with the aid of powerful wingbeats until it reaches .a height of some thirty meters. It\nthen gradually stops flapping and starts to turn without the least\neffort in zones of rising currents. It makes circles of about 60\nmeters in diameter. Meanwhile, it spreads its wings and tail wide\nand its remiges fan out. (See figure 204). The dihedrals formed by\nits wings in the vertical and horizontal planes are less acute than in\ngriffon vultures.\n\nFigure 204\nSilhouettes of Marabou or Adjutant Crane\nLeft: Circling; Right: Drifting with Flexed Wings\nThe marabou, like the vulutre, retracts its head into its\t\n/132\nshoulders, but its pouch dangles as a result, of the folding of the\nneck and is balanced in the wind. When they are flying with the wind,\nthe marabous lose a little altitude. This can be seen by an observer\na short distance away. They too turn in circles, sometimes for as\nlong as one or two hours, until they are so high as to be practically\ninvisible. It is entirely possible that they can climb in this manner\nat least up to 1,500 meters on hot days.\nThe marabou does engage in flexed wing flight (figure 204).\nHowever, the flexing is never very pronounced, as is the case with the\nvulture.\n180\n\nThe pelicans living on the shores of central African lakes start\ntheir flights by rowing like the preceding g irds. They then climb\nup to great heights without flapping their wings. They can be seen\nturning round and round for hours, their head retreacted between their\nshoulders and their wings slightly flexed (figure 205). They go\ndown and then back up again without flapping once.\n\nti \xe2\x80\xa2\n\nFigure 205\nSilhouette of Pelican\nSoaring with Flexed Wings\n\nFigure 206\nFrigate Bird Soaring\n\nFlight Below the Clouds\nAny cloud blocking off the sun for a significant length of time\non a warm, fair day interrupts the circling flight of all the birds I\nhave met . *.j.3ned fairly rapidly. The vultures and other birds that\nturn tirelessly high off the ground without losing altitude soon\nbegin to descend. As soon as the natural screen has disappeared, the\nsoarers begin to circle anew and gain height.\nHowever, on some stormy or clouded over hot days a special type\nof soaring can be observed. A bird beats its wings for a time and\nflies around as if it is looking for something. Then it suddenly\nstops flapping and rises several hundred meters without the least\nmovement.\nI have noticed the phenomenon in seagulls at Cherbourg\'s roadstead. Sea gulls leaving the beach are suddenly lifted up upon\narriving at the basin as if by an elevator to 500 or 600 meters in\naltitude. They then swerve and slide through the air back to the\nbeach.\nI have noticed that when they ascend like this, there is a storm\ncloud above them that seems to suck them up.\n\n181\n\nP\'\xc2\xae\n\nThe Flight of Frigate Birds\nUp to this point I have been describing the soaring of land\nbirds by means of thermal winds. Certain marine birds also make\nuse of rising thermal currents which form above the sea just as much\nas above the land in all tropical regions. Such is the case of the\nfrigate bird and the tropic bird. They are classed among the skilled\nsoarers and even though they most commonly live near the coast, are\ncapable of traveling several hundred kilometers out to sea.\nThe frigate birds are :iii confined to the tropical islands and\ncoasts of the southern hemisphere. Although they are one of the\ngreat masters of flight, they prefer to rest on rocks or in trees\nbecause of the diffiuclty they have in taking wing as a result of\ntheir small feet. The frigate bird launches itself from its high\nperch at the break of day. After flapping several times, it makes\ngreat circles in the air with its wings outstretched and climbs upward. It thus attains great heights without flapping its wings,\nas it were\nThe frigate bird\'s wings are often M-shaped (figure 206). As\nlong as it flies in this manner, it appears to be swimming in the\nair. At times it seems to be pinned to the sky like someone\'s kite.\nThere is no visible movement of its wings. Its tail alone appears\nto be fanned out and deeply slotted.\nIII. Soaring in Horizontal Winds\nThere exists a soaring bird that for a long time has inspired\nadmiration and surprise in the navigators who had the luck to encounter\nit. This is the wandering albatross, which has a wingspread of 3.50\nmeters and weighs 9 to 10 kg. It lives in the vast expanses of the\nPac;.fic and the southern Atlantic between 30 0 and 60 0 south latitude.\nEssentially a marine bird, it rests on the water at bight. During\nthe day it flies continually in quest of food.\n\nIt lives\nin\n\nwith its smaller cousins, the sooty and black-browed\nregions of extremely unsettled weather--in the south\nalbatrosses,\nseas storms are very frequent. All those who have landed on any of\nthe scattered southern islands have noticed how rarely the weather\nis calm.\nIt is certain that in the south seas high winds, attaining 20\nm/.sec, are frequent. They usually blow from the southwest and make\nthe water very rough. They also exhibit variations of speed and\nvertical and horizontal oscillations.\nAll all trosses can use these currents to keep themselves aloft\n.,,\nand move fr4,n one place to another. They make very extended flights\nwhich are always undertaken in midocean at a great distance from\nland. The extent of their flights can be estimated as a result of\nthe capture of an albatross with a 3.05 meter wingspan at Cape Horn\nin 1917. This albatross had been banded at Kerguelen Island. It had\ntherrefore traveled a distance of 13,000 km.\n\n182\n\n133\n\nIn the absence of any wine, the albatrosses alight on the water,\nwhere they move around by beating their wings, rapidly tiring themselves\nout. In calm weather, these birds also have difficulty taking off\nfrom the water. They are obliged to run with the waves in order to\ntake wing.\nThe Flight of\n\nAlbatrosses\n\nDuring a voyage to South Georgia, Idrac studied how albatrosses\nfly. He has given a detailed description of the maneuvers made by\nthese birds in order to soar. ldrac says that, provided there is\nenough wind, albatro sses soar outside of rising currents, far from the\ndistrubances created by boats and even when the wind and the waves\nhave almost the same speed.\nThey first skim the surface of the water, usually between two\nwaves, and preferably on the lee flank of a wave, and make a banking\nturn. After they have turned themselves around so as to pretty much\nface the wind (figure 207), they immediatley start climbing in a\nstraight line until they reach an altitude of 10 to 15 meters. They\nthen make another sharp turn, either to the left or the right. This\nis followed by a descent with the wind at their rear or side which\nleads them back tothe vicinity of the ocean surface. There they start\nover agin in an infinite cycle. (See figure 208). Idrac has pointed\nout that albatrosses begin soaring in a wind of around 1.50 to 5\nmeters in the layer just above the water. It is here that albatrosses\nchange course. Another point is that the maximum height to which the\nbirds climb is greater in high winds than in weak ones. The height\nattained varies from 8 to 15 meters, with the aerodynamic speed of\nlarge albatrosses being 22 w,/sec and ranging from 11 to 28 meters.\nLastly, the time required for the tianeuver is fairly constant:\nfrom 10 to 11 seconds for the wandering albatross and from 7 to 9\nseconds for the black-browed albatross.\nThanks to the films taken during the Scott expedition that\nJavouhey has made available to me, I have been able to analyze the\nmaneuvers of the wandering albatross myself. (See figure 209).\nMy study of this documentary evidence has enabled me to see\nfirst of all how albatrosses maneuver.\nAll of a sudden they ascend against the wind until they reach a\nheight that does not exceed 18 meters in the films. (See figure 210).\nThey then make a very wide U-turn 35 to 40 meters in diameter\n(figure 211). As soon as they are flying with the wind, they make a\ndive and then glide randomly until they approach the surface of the\nsea (figure 212). The albatrosses then begin their displacement anew\nwith another wide banking turn, most commonly along the lee slope of\na wave. They ascend once again and repeat the same maneuvers. While\nflying in this manner, their wings remain motionless and\nare extended to a degree that depends on the force of the wind. Their\ntail fans out, with the feet thrust rearward below the rectrices and\nsticking out from under the tail like two oars.\n\n183\n\n134\n\n%N\n\n\t\nFigure 207\n\t\nPath of Wandering Albatross\n\t\nSoaring above the Sea\n\nFigure 210\nPath of Albatross Gaining\nHeight against the Wind\n\n\\\t\n\nFigure 211\t\nThe Abrupt Changes of Course\t\nof an Albatross as it Skims\t\nthe Waves and as its Ascent Peaks\n\n,y::\t\n\n`.-mac.\\\n\nFigure 212\nDescent of Albatross\nGliding with the Wind\n\nWhen albatrosses make banking turns their outstretched wings\nform a single plane.\nThe flight of albatrosses is relatively rapid. Duirng the\nperiods of gliding with the wind, they frequently exceed 25 m/sec,\nwhile in other parts of the circle the speed is about 15 m/sec.\nAlbatrosses can thus maneuver in any direction during rough\nweather.\nThe albatross barely climbs higher than 5 to 6 meters above\nthe waves. However, when soaring by means of rising currents created\nby swells, it reaches greater heights. Some authors claim that outside the zone of rising currents it attains a height of 20 to 30-\n\n184\n\nr-\n\n`.- "^w" \'s:1..:\' \xe2\x80\xa2 "= :\t\n,fir ..... _ \xe2\x80\xa2 ..\n\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x96\xba\n\n. `^\n\njW\n\n^\n..^^^- -.a1^ rllS^+.rr.^s-^^1\'^-`\xe2\x80\xa2^J\n1\n\nN\n\nIN.\n\n^\xe2\x80\xa2 ^^f -.\t\n\n^ \'\xe2\x80\xa2c\' .vim.\t\n\n- ^:...,..,. ,^\t\n\n.:..\n\n.s^7K.\'ti^-^w^r.^ -. \'. ....+.... :eft^.

The bird \t\n\n135\n\nmakes use of the energy of the wind to soar in these circumstances.\nIt flies into the air current, which increases in strength in a\ndirection opposite to its own movement, and it gains altitude as it\nloses speed. However, the albatross does not continue climbing until\nit has lost all speed. Before this happens, it makes a U-turn and\nrecovers speed. The U!-turn takes 10 seconds to complete. The\nalt(a.tross can continue its flight in this manner for hours on end.\nWith its wings absolutely motionless, it climbs agianst the wind and\ndescends with it. Sometimes it turns alternately to the right and the\nleft so as to describe an undulated line. The bird thus continuously\nbuilds up potential energy which it then transforms into kinetic\nenergy as it drifts through layers of air.\n\nDuring this mode of flight, whether in circles or undulated\nlines, the wings are set in a particular fashion. When an albatross\nascends against the wind, its wings are generally curved to form a\n__\ncircumflex accent. At this moment it is flexing its wings while the\nspeed of the wind is increasing. Furthermore,; it is sometimes\nobserved that the tips of the hand wings are bent upwards somewhat\nin the course of the ascent. Albatrosses only spread their wings\nout during relatively calm periods and especially whenturning. Their\nwings at these times are straight and lie in a single plane. The\npreceding description applies to all albatrosses, but particularly\nto wandering and black browed albatrosses. These two fly at a low\nrate of speed, 18 mjsec, and the period of their cycle of maneuvers\nis on the order of 7 seconds. The flight of the sooty albatross is\nperhaps even closer to perfection than that of the two others. In\naddition, it very frequently reaches greater heights. It is not\nuncommon to see it pass above boats in the course of its circuit. Even.\nso, it never exceeds a height of 50 meters above the sea. Lastly,\nit often flies with flexed wings against strong winds blowing over\nan almost calm sea. This is shown in the photograph in figure 213.\nThe Flight of Petrels and Fulmars\n\nThere is another bird, the giant fulmar (figure 214), whose style\nof flight merits attention. It can be seen making great circles\nalong shorelines with its wings held more stiffly than the albatross\'s.\nIt is in search of carcasses for food, which it cuts up like a\nvulture. No matter how long one ob&erves it, no movement of the\nwings will ever be visible. It makes free use of rising currents\nreflected by obstacles, but it can ascend just as well against the\nwind until it is completely motionless and stalling. It then makes\na wide circle and regains speed as it descends almost to the water.\nThere, it turns to face the wind anew, so as to gain height. This\nmaneuver last 9 seconds.\nCertain well outfitted birds living cu ff the coast of Scotland,\nthe Hebrides, and Iceland, like the arctic fulmar, perform feats of\t\nsoaring far from ships or the coast. Their maneuvers are identical\nto those of the albatross in the Antarctic Ocean (figure 215). They\nfollow a twisting line made up of ascents of less than 15 meters,\ndescents, and sharp turns as long as the wind is less than 6 meters.\nThe period of their cycle of maneuvers is about 7 seconds.\n\n188\n\n;136\n\nwY\n\n...^ \xe2\x80\xa2" r\' . ry^^-.\n..w.^^^^ 7-7^\'ti^\xe2\x80\xa2i .f . w l^Y_ . ^ ^ ^\t\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2+^. \'^ .f.+}N ^X^L^^y=:\n\n1:1. 1"\'Aogug\n\nFigure 213\nSooty Albatross (Phoebetria fuliginos Gm) Moving without\nBeating its Wings against a Moderate Wind Blowing over an\nAlmost Calm Sea\n\n189\n\n0\n\n4 Gul s.,\nAT4\n\nAr\n\nFeb\n\nire\n\'Ora\n\n71.0\n\nr7-\n\nL\n\nI\n\nL\n\nFigure 214\nFilm of a Giant Fulmar\'s Periodic Maneuvers (Macronectes\nGiganteus Gm) above the Sea (Film by Idrac) Frames Separated by 1/3 Second (Read from Left to Right and Top to Bottom)\n\n190\n\nFigure 215\nPath of Soaring Arctic\nFulmar (from Idrac)\n\nFigure 216\nPath of a Soaring Gannet\n\nThe Flight of Gannets\nI have had the opportunity to study the flight of gannets in the\nperform a series of ascents\nAtlantic several times. Gannets\t\nand descents like other marine species. These are also in the form\nof circles or along a more or less twisty path.\nAt the moment when the wind rises gannets turn to face it and\nwith its aid they increase their altitude without ever flapping\ntheir wings. They can gain 6 to 10 meters in this way, depending on\nthe force of the wind. They then drift back down, keeping the wind\nalways to their rear (figure 216).\n\nIt\n\nFigure 217\nInclination of a Gannet\'s\nPath when Soaring in\nCircles\n\nFigure 218\nForm of a Gannet\'s Wings\nLeft- when Banking\nRight: when Ascending against\nthe Wind\n\nThe circles made by gannets have an average diameter of 35 meters\nand take about 9 seconds to complete. The clii.,bing angle is generally\nabout 20\xc2\xb0 (figure 217). When ascending, the wings are flexed a bit\nand viewed from in front have the form of a circumflex accent. When\nbanking, they are, on the contrary, flat (figure 218).\nThe flight of flocks of gannets over calm seas and at a height\nwhere the rising current engendered by the swell is no longer detectable can yield some interesting observations. I have often witnessed\ntrips made against the wind by a hundred cf these birds crowded\n\n191\n\ntogether. They can be seen\nslowly clim!)ing "he stream of\nair, each repeat\xc2\xb1ng the same\nmovements, either all at once\nor with some interval of time\nbetween them.

There\nare t\'Iree types of soaring:\n1) Soaring by birds using the rising currents created by\nobstacles. This is undertaken by:\nSea gulls above cliffs or behind ships;\nRaptors in the mountains;\nShearwaters above the crests of waves.\n2) Soaring of birds using rising currents resulting from\nsolar heating or existing under clouds. This is practiced by\nvultures and kites above deserts and by frigate birds and sea gulls\nabove the ocean.\n3) The soaring of marine birds like the albatross, which\nmaneuver in horizontal winds having variations of speed and inclination.\n\n192\n\nRECOMMENDED READING\n\nAhlborn, "Der Segelflug", 5 Beih. d.

The Dimensions of wings. \t\n\n139\n\nThe study of the varieties of flta.*p ng flight and soaring man\ntioned in previoue lessons has laic the basis for classifying birds\ninto twenty groups. As we shall see, each of these groups is\ncharacterized by very clear differences in its manner of flying.\nHere is the list of groups.\nThe Classification of Birds\nI. Diurnal Soaring Raptors - Land birds who do not flap their\nwings very often and most commonly soar with the help of rising\nthermal or obstruction currents. Excellent gliders (average speed\n30 to 40 km/hr).\n\nVultures, eagles, buzzards, harriers, kites.\nSea birds who beat their wings extremely\nII. soaring Palmipeds\t\nrarely- and soar for ours on end by using winds of uneven speed\nand inclination or that are rising.\nAlbatrosses, w ant fulmars, arctic fulmars, gannets, black\nbacked sea gulls, O;igatebirds, tropicbirds.\nIII. Soaring Waders -- Usually lake or marsh birds whose slow\nflapping flight is frequently interrupted by fairly long glides\nand who soar by using winds having a rising component (average\nspeed 45 km/hr).\n:marabous, cranes, storks, spoonbills, egrets, herons.\nIV. Rowing/Soaring Palmi eds -- Marine or coastal birds who\ntravel by means of moderately frequent wingbeats (2 to 6 per second),\nglide remarkably well, and are capable of soaring with the aid of\nrising currents along cliffs or waves (average speed: 50 to 70 km/hr).\nSea gulls, Cory\'s shearwaters, storm petrels, cape petrels.\nV. Nocturnal Rowing/ Gliding Raptors - Land birds who fly slowly\nand quietly with infrequent wing eats\t\nto 3 per second) and are\nable to glide remarkably well (average speed: 30 to 40 km/hr).\nEagle owls, shorteared owls, screech owls, other owls.\nVI. Rowing/ Glidinc r Corvids -- Land birds who fly and flap\nslowly. Their w,ngbeats (1 to T per second) frequently cease altogether and are replaced by a period of gliding. Some of these birds\noccasionally make: use of rising winds in attempts at soaring (average\nspeed: 40 to 50 km/hr).\nGrows, rooks, choughs, magpies, jays.\nVII. Rowing/Soaring Passerines -- Land birds who fly very rapidly /140\nand are capable of sqbstanEial periods of gliding punctuated by\nr\n194\t\n\n_\n\nrapid, often intermittent wingbeats (8 to 10 per second). They can\n\nalso soar.( Average speed: 60 to 150 km/hr.)\nNightju \'s, swifts, and swallows.\nVIII. Diurnal Rowing Ra tors -- Rapidly flying land birds some\xe2\x80\x94\ntimes capable -o performing short glides or soaring above wooded\ngroves. However, their only means of ascent and progression is\nmore or less rapid flapping 0 to 7 times/sec) (average speed: 80\n\nf\n\nto 100 km/hr).\n\nGoshawks, sparrowhawks, falcons.\nIX. Long Distance Rowing Passerines\t\n\nRepresented by the\n\nmajority or smail Iana 51ras, WHO g0nefblly flap their wings rapidly\n(6 to 20 beats per second) and then fly off like arrows with their\n\nwings partly retracted, only to start flapping anew. The resulting\nflight is undulated to a certain degree (average speed: 40 km/hr).\nLarks, wagtails, shrikes, nightingales, orioles, blackbirds,\nthrushes, starlings, finches, sparrows, goldfinches, buntings,\ncrested wrens.\nX. Short Distance Rowing Passerines -- Includes birds adapted\n\nto arboreal _l_e, such as titmice and woodpeckers, whose flight is\n\nmost often of short duration, and species like wrens that have\nalmost lost the ability to fly.\nXI. Vibr ating Passerines -- Whose lift is supplied by vibrating\ntheir \xe2\x80\x94\nwings (30 to 40 beats a second).\nHummingbirds.\nXII. Terrestrial Rowing Waders -- Who rapidly flap their wings\n(5 to TO w ngbeats sec) and only g ide for short distances (average\nspeed 60 to 80 km/hr).\nGreat bustards, little bustards, great plovers, golden plovers,\nwoodcocks, lapwings.\nXIII. Waterside Rowing Waders -- Who progress by rapidly beating\n\ntheir wings (5 to 10 beats per second) sometimes punctuated by\nperiods of gliding performed with the wings flexed and the wingtips\npointed rearward (average speed: 60 to 80 km/hr).\nCurlews, snipes, ruffs, sandpipers, godwits, avocets.\nXIV-\xc2\xb0 Rowing Columbidae - Rapid flying land birds who produce\n-their lift and propulsion by means of repeated wingbeats (3 to 8\nper second), and are able to glide for awhile when their speed is\nsufficient. They can also drift through the air with their flexed\nwings thrust rearward. (Average speed: 80 to 100 km/hr).\nPigeons, turtledoves.\n\n195\n\nXV. Rowin2 Gallinaceae -- Land birds who progress by inter\nspers^ng periods of rapid flapping (6 to 13 times a second) with\nperiods of gliding with their wings outstretched. Their glides\ncarry them 50 meters or so (average speed: 60 to 80 km/hr).\nCapercaillies, ptarmigans, grouses, hazel grouses, partridges,\nquails.\nXVI.Swimmin / Rowin Palmipeds -- Aquatic birds able to dive and\nmove rapidly t rnugh the air.They fly by energetically beating\ntheir wings ( 5 to 12 times a second) in a continuous manner. Except\nfor swans and geese, they almost never glide. ( Average speed:\n100 to 120 km/hr)\n\nSwans, geese, ducks, teals, pochards, scoters, cormorants, many\nshearwaters.\nXVII. Diving/Rowing Palmipeds -- Birds adapted to aquatic life, /141\nstill able to perform flights of some duration\nbut for the most part\n\nby ,cans of rapid flapping (average speed 40 to 50 km/hr) .\n\nMergansers, grebes, loons, guillemots, puffins, little auks.\n\nlife\n\nXVIII. Diving / Rowing Waders -- Birds who are adapted to aquatic\nto some extent and\n\ngenerally capable only of short flights.\n\nCoots, waterhens, rails.\nXIX. Dvin /Fawin Passerines -- Birds who fly with the aid of\nto 10 times a second) and who are admirable divers.\nrapid flapping\t\n\nKingfishers.\nXX. Running Birds -- Incapable of flight.\n\nRheas, ostriches, penguins.\nNotice that the groups represent practical ly all the orders or\nsub-orders of the class to which birds belong.\nHaving said this, I will now report on my own research on\nbirds\' organs and their relation to their mode of flight. I shall\ntry to draw out all the useful information contained in this study.\nThe conclusions following from an examination of avian characteristics\ncan be a fertile source of ideas in airplane design and construction.\nThey are above all a means of achieving a better understanding of the\naerodynamic conditions encountered during flight.\nAs we shall see, the various bird groups possess different\nfeatures. Their wingspread, aspect ratio, wing area, and\ncaudal area are far from having relatively equal dimensions. The\ndifferences even extend to the various groups of soaring birds, and\ndepend on the winds they utilize.\n\n196\n\nBody Length\nThe fundamental point of comparison in all that follows is\nweight, to which all other data will be related. According to the\nlaws of geometric similarity, weight increases in Froportion to\nthe cube of linear dimensions, length, width, etc. Meanwhile,\nbirds\' flesh has roughly the same density as ours. The cubic root\nof weight is therefore the variable we will most often turn to for\ncom p aring lengths, the square root of surface areas, etc.\nOne of a bird\'s dimensions has seemed to me important to study.\nThis is body length, which corresponds to the length of an airplane\'s\nfuselage. I mrasurea a bird\'s length from the tip of its beak to\nthe end of its tail while in flight position, with its neck elongated.\nThe length in and of itself has no value because of the extremes of\nsize observed in birds. I -therefore divided it by the cube root\nof the weight P expressed ir- grams so as to have dimensionless and\ncomparable ratios. I found that, proportionally speaking, body\nlength sloes not vary appreciably in birds and that it is related to\nthe size of the neck and tail. The animal\'s fuselage is shortest\nin groups where both\t\nneck and `_ail are small. It is greatest by\n\none or two fifths when one of these organs is ^i- \xe2\x80\xa2 ch more elongated\nthan usual. Such is the case of waders like the herons, who possess\na long neck. Another example is passerines like the swifts, who have\nlarge tails.\nWingspread\nThe wing dimensions tnemsel.ves, length and width, have not been\nthe focus of much attention. Only wingspread, which is the maximum\ndistance between the two wingtips, has been the object of study by\nsome authors.\nIf birds are ranked by the ratio of wingspread in centimeters \t\n/142\nto the cubic root of weight,\t it becomes obvious that soaring or gliding b,\t ?s have the greatest relative wingspread and that in contrast\nall rowing birds have a much smaller one.\t\nIn other words, birds with\nthe highest wingbeat frequency have the smallest wingspread.\t\nAn\nexample is L T allinaceous birds, who make up to thirteen beats per\nsecond and haVE half the relative wingspread of the soaring palmipeds:\nGroup,\n\nRatio of Wingspan RATIO\n\xe2\x80\x94\nto Real Hand wing\n3\n\nBody\nWt,\n\nLeng^\ntc\t P\n\n(gr)\n\nto 3T\n\nBody\t\nLength\t\n\n2 552.7\n\n14.7\n\n2,:GIi\n\nI\t\n\n4,1\n\n11,2\n\n2.ali\n\nI\t\n\n4,4\n\n11.1\n\n2,2:t\n\nNocturnal Rowing/Gliding Raptors\n\nI\t Is6 ! 1 .5\n(07,1\n166.1 I\t\n\n13,7\n\n2,59\n\nRowing / Soaring Waders\n\n2 W1,1;\n\nI\t\n\n1:1,3\n\n46.7\nt_\xe2\x96\xba:1,7 I\t\n272\n\nJail;\n\n12.1\n122\nIii9\n\n] ,!A;\n215\ni ON\n\n:1\n\n176.9\n\n1117\t\n\n1.8t\n\n:1,2\t\n\nSoaring Palmipeds\nDiurnal Soaring Raptors\nRowing / Soaring Palmipeds\n\nRowing / Soaring Passerines\nDirunal Rowing Raptors\nRowing/Gliding Corvids\nWaterside Rowing Waders\n\nI\n\n4,:1\n4\n:1,1;\n4. 1\n11,i\n\n7\nII\n\n197\n--\t\n\n-\t\n\nA\n\nRode\n\nGroup\t\n\nRatio\n\nof\n\niiln\n\na \'all\n\nRATIO\n\nto Reft Nand Winq\n\nWt.\t\n\n(gr)\t\n\nI.enq`h\n\nbody\t\n\nto\t\n\nLength to 9\n\nTerrestrial Rowing waders\n\nRowing Columbidae\nflowing / Swinuning Pa lmipeds \t\nI\xe2\x80\xa2ong Distance Rowing Passerines\nShort Distance Rowing Passerines\nVibrating Passerines\nDiving/Rowing Waders\n\nDiving / Rowinq Passerine:;\nDiving / Rowing Palmipeds\nRowing Gall.inaceae\n\n1\t .I,N.1\n\n"1\xe2\x80\xa2;1\n\n1\xe2\x96\xba\n\n14\t\n\nI\t\n\n11 .:1\t\n\nX\xe2\x96\xba\n1..441\n1,.!\n1.

Mmuningbirds are also in\nthis category. The hand wing is much smaller in continu r\xe2\x80\xa2 ts rowers.\nthat it\nIt is shortest in aallinaceae, in which it is half the r\t\nis in soarers.\nIt is precisely because their wingspread and hand wings are\nsmall that most rowing birds cannot soar. They are obliged to flap\ntheir wings more or less constantly. In general, the shorter the\nwings have become, the larger winybeat frequency is.\nAspect Ratio\nThe findings on the subject of win,\' ) width are no less interesting. In order to have comparable data, 1 measured tilt , width of\nwinds at tilt , handjoint and than compared it to actual body length\nand the cube root of weight. I also endeavored to discover the\nwings\' aspect ratio, which plays an important role in the design\nof modern aircraft, by dividing the win.Tspread by the width of the\nwings.

Included here are rowing/soaring land birds,\nrowers, and soarers using ascending winds.\n2) Series R, made up of aquatic or shore birds accustomed to\nliving in regions where large air currents are prevalent and to\nusing a strong horizontal wind either for help in flying or for\nactually soaring. In this series, the individuals have a narrow\nwind and a large aspect ratio, no matter what their habitual .\xe2\x80\x9eode of\nfli.tht is. In such circumstances, the actior.of ,.he air currents\nseems to be the cause of the reduction in wing width, or rather of\nthe fact that a narrow wing is necessary for maneuvering in such an\nenvironment. This is certainly true for soaring palmipeds. The\nmore one of them is used to stiff winds, the narrower its wings\n,ire. As for rowing/soaring passerines, another reason must be\nfound for their wing configuration, wtiich is close to that of\nm,^ritime soarers. We will return to this question later on.\nThere is a way to illustrate graphically the differences between\nthe various groups of g irds. To do this, I made photographs of birds\nwith their wings outstretched and reduced them so as to give them\nthe size they would have if they all weighed the same. Figures 220224 depict in a striking fashion the variations in windspread, wing\nwidth, and aspect ratio. The nature of the differences can thus be\nbetter appreciated from this rigorously precise procedure.\n\n199\n\nFigures 220--221: Birds\' center of gravity and characteristics,\naccording to flight mode, ventral view.

It\ncan be found in diurnal soaring raptors (_figure 220) with the\npeculiarity that the wing tips are cut into strips. This is the\nresult of an abrupt narrowing of the ends of the large quills. Interdigital spaces of variable size but similar shape are thus :left\nbetween them The free end of the wing is also slotted in waders\npossessing large airfoils (figure 221), who often perform feats of\nsoaring, and in a, few nocturnal rowing/gliding raptors (figure 220),\nwho fly by slowly rowing or silently gliding.\nThere are birds with almost round wings. Some, Like the wallcreepers, fly along rocks like butterflies; others, like the wrens,\nhardly fly at all.\nIn contrast, the rapid flapping groups have wings which thin\nout to an extent depending on the speed at which they flap. Their\nwings thus assume a somewhat pointed shape. In columbidae, gallinaceae, and most passerines, the hand wing; i.e. the upper part beyond\nthe hand joint, is the only tapered section. The wing then takes\non an oval shave, with the big end close to the body. Furthermore,\nthe large remiges of the gallinaceous group (figure_ 223) narrow at\nthe tips, leaving slots between them, as in the soaring raptors. An\nexception to this is the quail, who flies in short bursts and whose\nwings taper considerably, too.\nIn diurnal rowing ,raptors (figure 220), who flap their wings\nto provide forward motion, the wing becomes more pointed as wingbeat\nspeed increases. The whole gambit of wing configurations, from\nthe pointed region being confined to the hand wing in goshawks to\nthe scythe-shaped wing of the rapidly rowing hobbies, is found in\nthis group. The flight of swifts and swallows is similar to.that of\nhobbies,and these rowing/soaring passerines also have a highly\ntkpered wing that becomes more pointed as its movements increase\n(figure 223) .\nWing shape is so closely determined by how fast a bird flaps\nthat hummingbirds, who row so quickly that their upper members seem\nto vibrate, also have wings resembling scythes.\nThe pointed form is also encountered in other groups including\nalmost all palmipeds and most of the waders (figure 224). However,\nthere is not just a single cause of tapering. For some birds it\ndepends on speed, but it also arises from the action of the air\ncurrents through which a species flies. The result is to diminish\nthe wing depth to such an extent that certain soarers, like the\nalbatross (figure 221), support their bodies with airfoils compar\nable to narrow rods.\n\n205\n\nAll water and coastal birds fly-.ng in these conditions have\nnarrower wings than those of land birds. This is true whatever\ntheir mode of .flight, rwing or soaring. It can only be atmospheric\nconditions that cause the transformation since waders living on the\nplains, as well as lapwings, woodcocks, and bustards, are provided\nwith much less tapered wings than those of their cousins living\nat the edge of bodies of water and having an appreciably equal\nwingbeat frequency.\n\nI have carried out experiments proving that the above explapation of the variation of wing shape is correct. By modifying the\nconfiguration of birds\' wings, I could see that wing shape is in\nfact due to the action of the ambient milieu and the manner in which\nwings move, which causes reactions having the result of partly or\ntotally tapering the wings.\n\nWing Cross Sections\nAvian wings have other characteristic features. Whatever their\nshape, their lower surface is always concave in every direction.\nThe wing is composed, as I have said, of a plane underlying the\nupper limb\'s bony and muscular .masses and on the average..equal to a\nthird of the wing width in narrow winged birds and a quarter of the\nwind width in wide winged ones.\n\nFigure 225\nAverage Wing Curvature\nin a Soaring Raptor\n\nFigure 226\nAverage Wing Curvature\nin a Soaring Palmiped\n\nThe remiges come next. They are always arched downwards and\nmake an angle with the first plane that decreases as it approaches\nthe body. For most birds this angle is very large, as can be seen\nin figure 225.\nIn contrast, the angle is much smaller in aquatic species, who\nlive in strong air currents. It is always less than 1:406 according\nto my own research. Great soaring birds like albatrosses (figure\n226) and gannets exhibit angles on the order of 120\xc2\xb0 around the elbow.\nThe wing thus looks like it curves very strongly downward in this\narea. Given its narrowness, it resembles a gutter, and the wind\'s\naction on it is very effective. The angle increases as the wingtip\nis approached. My studies indicate that the lower surface of the\nsling is only slightly concave in the hand section. The curvature\nbecomes pronounced near the carpus and increases further the nearer\none gets to the body. This is true for all birds, whatever the\nmagnitude of wing curvature.\n\n206\nMON\n\n145\n\n.rte\ns\xe2\x80\xa2S\n\nto\'\n\nlie\nFigure 227\nBearded Vulture Wing with\nCross Sections Showing\nVarious Curvatures and\nAngles of Incidence\n\nFigure 228\nSoaring Albatross\nWing with Cross Sections\nShowing Various Curvatures and Angles\n\nThe variable magnitude of the curvature is shown for a raptor\nin figure 227 and for a palmiped in figure 228.\n\n/146\n\nWing Feathers\nTaking a look at feathers., one sees that the remiges of raptors\nand soaring waders, as well as those of pelicans, all birds specializing in using ascending winds in similar regions, have a special\nappearance. The primary remiges are wide at the base, but the barbs\nget narrower at the tips (figure 229). This is why there are slots\nbetween remiges. In contrast, the secondary remiges have well\ndeveloped barbs with pretty much the same length everywhere\n(figure 23\'0) .\nThe wing feathers of marine soarers, rowing raptors, small\nwaders, and ducks are dif`,c^.rent: The primary remiges are tapered\nand ,remind one of a pointed knife (figure 229). They are never\nseparated.from each other and instead are massed together so as to\nact like a sing-le remex. The secondary remiges are, in contrast,\nlittle developed (figure 230). In addition, they appear proportionally\nsmaller than in soaring raptors.\nNotice also that the primary remiges of land soarers are more\ncurved than those of marine soarers (figure 231). The narrowed part\nof the large plumes curves downward at rest much more in the former\nbirds than they do in the latter.\nOn the othe r hand, the secondary remiges of marine soarers are\nmuch Aorei. arched " than those of land soa r ers. Their curvature resembles\n}\n207\n\n/147\n\nthe general curvature of the wing (figure 232).\nWing Thickness\nThe thickness of bird wings varies by group_ and, therefore,\nflight mode. Gross sections of a *ping at the middle part of the\narm\t\nreveal a rounded anterior edge, a concave lower surface\nand an upper curvature that rises steeply at first and then descends\nmore gradually. The highest point of the upper curvature is\nlocated at the thickest part of the wing. This is where the midframe member is found. It is more elevated at the elbow than at\n\nthe hand joint. .\n\n6\n\nf\n\nFigures 229 & 230\nRemige Length in Soaring Birds\nwith Dimensions they would have if All the Birds Weighed the Same\nLeft: Primary Remiges: 1;, Eagle; 2, Gannet; 3, Albatross\nRight: Secondary Remiges: 1, Eagle; 2, Gannet; 3, Albatross\nSuch an arrangement gives the wing a characteristic configuration. Its thickness decreases from the point of attachment to the\nwing tip and from the midframe-member to the following edge, where\nthe wing is thin.\nAn examination of their wings will prove that soaring birds\nhave very thick ones compared to other birds, with albatrosses\nhaving the thickest of all. In contrast, gallinaceae and rowing\npalmipeds have the thinnest wings. Figure 233 very graphically\ndisplays the wing cross sections of the principal avian groups.\nLastly,.bird wings change shape in certain characteristic ways\nduring flight. They undergo a double curvature in all birds,\nwhether they are gliding or flapping (figures 234 and 235).\n\n208\n\n/148\n\nFigures 231 & 232\nCurvature in Soaring Bird Remiges Reduced to the Same Length\nLeft: p rimary Remiges: 1, Eagle; 2, Gannet; 3, Albatross\nRight: Secondary Remiges: l., Eagle 2, Albatross; 3, Gannet\n\nt\t\n\n2\t\n\nS\n\nFigure 233\nSchematic Wing Cross Section Showing their Relative Width\nand Thickness as well as Curvature According to Flight Type\n1, Bearded Vulture; 2, Eagle Deal; 3, Wandering Albatross;\n4, Common Heron; 5, Common Swift; 6, Yellow Bunting;\n7, Ringdove; e, Black Grouse; 9, Common Pochard; 10, Rednecked Grebe\n\nlam\xe2\x80\x94"~\n\nFigure 234\nTransverse Cross Section through the Carpus of an\nOutstretched Albatross Wing\nLeft: Standing-on its \'eet; \'Right\xe2\x80\xa2: During Gliding Flight\n\nw r. r. w +.^ra+n\n\nw iss w .n. ^ w.\t\n\nFigure 235\nTransverse Cross Section through the Carpus\nof an Outstretched Kite Wing\nLeft: Standing on its Feet Right: During Gliding Flight\nWing Size\nAmong the organs of flight, wings stand out as most important.\nWing size has therefore been the subject of much work. The ratio\nof wing surface area to body weight, S I P, has particularly attracted scientists\' attention over the years. Sven though such a ratio\nprobably does not have a great significance (we shall return to\nthis point later), it has been adopted by many authors. This is\nwhy we are going to present the findings concerning it first.\nIn taking up the study of avian wing size, I did not calculate\nwing area geometrically, as almost all my predecessors had done.\nRather, I spread bird wings out over graph paper and traced them\nas accurately as possible. This was done in such a way that the\nseparation between remiges was close to what i t was in nature. I\nthen drew their contour, including the slots frequently encountered\non the ends of some wings. I thus obtained a figure for the real\nwing surface area that was very close to reality.\nI first divided the real wing area expressed in cm 2 by body\nweight expressed in grams and then sought to discover what the\narea per kg of animal was. Here are the figures I obtained for\nthe various groups.\nAv.

However., further examination quickly reveals that the\nrelationship does not vary in a simple fashion. At most, one can\nmake the ~pproximate generalization that the largest birds have the\nleast wing area per kilogram while the smaller ones have the most.\nSuch an approximation would be, moreover, partly at odds with current\nobservations. For example, when comparing a quail and an owl, it\nseem obvious that the owl has more extensive wings, yet this is contrary to the relationship I have just mentioned. Let us say right\noff that this result has no meaning. It is the consequence of\nmathematical artifices. In fact, the ratio:\n\n149\n\nK12\t\nWing Area\t\nK\nBody Weight - K \'I^ - TIT\nis not dimensionless. It is still a=function of one of the bird\'s\nlinear dimensions. The larger this dimension is, the smaller is the\nratio in question.\nIn the organometric research I carried out on wpgs, I preferred\nto make an innovation and relat? real wing area in cm to body surface\n(P in grams). Ratios of relative\narea calculated by the formula\t\nsurface areas are obtained in this way. They are easier to compare,\ndimensionless, and of incontrovertible value.\nHere are the average results I found for the different groups:\nAv.

The range is from 7.2\nto 25.9. It can be made even greater if the extreme values are\n\nincluded. The relative area of the penguin\'s atrophied wing is only\n0.4 E while that of the Montagu\'s harrier is 33.9.\n\nI also sought to determine the bird\'s real body surface area \t\nso as to counteract objections that could be raised concerning the use\nof fictitious body areas in my calculations. To acc-Omplish this, I\napplied a new method, used for the first time anywhere: by a coworker\n\n150\n\nand me.\n\nI made up a batch of heavy paint by thoroughly mixing 26 gr of\nceruse with 100 gr of linseed oil. I coated the body of a plucked\nanimal with thi s paint. All I had to do was to weigh the .featherless\nbody before and after painting to have the exact weight W of the\npaint used. If previously the same thing had been clone to a 100 cm 2\nsquare of skin, the surface area S in square centimeters can be found.\nBy dividing real wing area by $, ratios identical to those in\nthe preceding table are obtained. The order of the birds is practically \t\nthe same, as the following table proves;\nBird\t\nGriffon Vulture\t\nMarabou\t\n\nKestrel\t\n\nJackdaw\t\nBull finch\t\n\nBody\t\nWeight\t\n(90\t\n7 269\t\n+\n7 ON)\t\n\n21\t\n\'2;\xe2\x96\xba;1\t\n221,1\t\n\nGr. of\t\nCeruse\t\nApplied\t\n\n7 \xe2\x96\xba\t\nN 7\t\n7.50\t\n\nReal Wing\t\nArea\t\nbm )\n7 252\t\n8 27o\t\n7t1,^,2\t\n\nRelative\nWing Area\n06\nIt")\n91\n\nti,;^ll\t\n\n11141,;0\t\n\n78\n\nI\'m\t\n\n115\t\n\no\nl2\n\nGray Partridge\t\n\nN47\t\n\n10\t\n\n1311\xe2\x96\xba\t\n\nI;1\n\nSandpaper\n\n1133\t\n\n6\t\n\n31i11\t\n\n111\n\n1 II \xe2\x96\xba ;"\xe2\x96\xba\n\n>I\t\n\nMallard Duck\t\nk\t\n!\t\n\n;19\n\nAll thy: evidence therefore indicates that different birds carry\ndifferent amounts of flying equipment. Those Who Have the greatest\nrelative wing area area the soarers or accomplished gliders. They are\nin fact :able to fly or glide over long p e riods of time precisely\nbecause they are well decked out. However, it sould be pointed out\nthat the great soarers, like the palmipeds, who make use of stiff,\ngusty horizontal winds have smaller airfoils than the soaring raptors\nwho use rising thermal currents an d need more extensive wing surfaces\nfor the sake of efficiency. The difference in relative area results\nfrom the fact that although the relative wingspreads are the same, the\nrelative widths are very different.\n\n212\n\nj\n\nIn addition, nocturnal raptors, even though they are rowers\nand gliders, possess wings of a size almost equal to that of soaring\nraptors. The rowing raptors, in contrast, have smaller wings, and\nthis is the reason that they are obliged to row.\nGroups having an average or small relative wing area are all\ncomposed of rowers who can sometimes glide over short distances when\ntheir speed is sufficient (gallinaeeae, columbidae), or of birds who\nare only able to keep themselves aflight by continually flapping their\nwings (rowing palmipeds). The hummingbirds, who only stay in the air\nby vibrating their wings, have one of the smallest wing surfaces.\nLastly, I sould add that within groups the ratios are fairly close\ntogether, as can be noticed by examining the individual figures. For\nexample, there are no soaring raptors possessing a relative wing area\nless than 17. It can therefore be surmised that below this point, true\ngliding becomes difficult and that more or less continuous flapping\nflight is the only mode possible. Such flight becomes more and more\nimpaired and short as wing area is reduced.\nBy studying figures 220 to 224, one can get a good idea of the\ndifferences that exist between different groups of birds.\n151\n\nAvian Load\nIn the meantime, there is a characteristic, known in aviation\nas load, which represents the number of kilograms supported per\nsquare meter of airfoil. (P/S) and which.our conclusions have not\ntaken into account.\nLoad, being the ratio between a weight and aft area, is not a\npure number. It is affected by a linear dimension of the apparatus\nor animal under: consideration and consequently can be used legitimately\nonly to compare apparatus and animals of the same size.\n\nThe comparison ..s very interesting to make for airplanes of the\nsame weight. However when trying to compare directly the load of\na 10,000 kg airplane with that of a 1,000 kg machine or that of a bird\n100 time:.a smaller, or that of an eagle to that of a hummingbird, one\nrisks malting very gross errors. One might be induced to conclude, for\nexample, that the largest birds are the least adept at flight. This\nis the opposite of what was decided for the ratio S/P and is manifestly\nincorrect.\nFor making comparisons with airplanes it might be useful to\nlist the magnitude of the loads. In each group, I averaged the total\nweight of the member species and the average loads supported per\nsquare meter. I thus obtained the first two columns of the following\ntable:\n\n213\t\n\na\n\n\t\n\t\nAv.

Now, a clear decrease in load does not\noccur. There must be a phenomenon that the mathematical artifice\nalready mentioned has not completely covered up. It must therefore\nbe uncovered and drawn intothe light.\nAs I have said, load comparisons between animals of the same\nsize are legitimate. Now, suppose that all our birds have the same\ndensity, which is not far from the truth, and the same or similar\nshapes, which is not at all true. Let P , P 2 , P3, .....

Thus, a machine with a wingspan of\n10 meters carrying 40 kg/m reduced to a one meter wingspan would\ncarry only 4 kg/m . In contrast, a divigg/rowing palmiped with a\n10 meter wingspan would support 101 kg/m .\nAltitude and wing Surface\n\nBirds not only remain aloft and move forward by moving their\nwings, they also ascend.up to varying altitudes.\nThe altitudes attained by birds are, as a whole, poorly known.\nIt is almost impossible to determine the platform, or maximum attainable height, of small birds. A movie camera or even an observer\nrapidly loses sight of them. The situation is the same for large,\nvery high-flying species, like vultures.\nThis is why the published data are frequently imprecise or even\ntotally off the wall.\nSome progress has been made by especially curious balloon and\nairplane pilots and mountain climbers who had gotten into the habit\nof making observations during their ascents. By noting birds that\nwere flying near or above them and by measuring the altitude with a\n215\n\n/153\n\nx\n\nbarograph, they have established that such and such a species can\nfly to such and such a height.

This seems logical enough since it is\nknown in aviation that an airplane\'s platform is partly dependent\non the size of its wings and that in theory wing area must be augmerited the higher one goes to maintain. constant lift. This is because\nof the reduction in air density with increasing altitude.\nWing Weight\nBird wings, whose characteristics vary from group to group,\nare ,Dut in motion by the action of the large and small pectoral\nmuscles, as we have already seen. The function of the former is to\nlower the wing, while the latter serves to raise it in the course of\na wingbeat.\nBefore taking up the study of these muscles, and consequently\nof the avian motor in the different modes of flight, it is useful\nto take a look at relative wing weight. This weight could have an\neffect on the effort required by a bird to make its wings move.\nThere are two points to consider concerning wing weight. They\nare the ratio of real wing weight to body weight and the ratio of\nwing weight to wing area, which will inform us of their lightness\nor heaviness. It is in tact very important to determine whether\nwings are massive or light relative to the extent of their surface.\nIn order to present an introduction to the subject, I am going\nto start off by considering the average relative wing weight, i.e.,\nthe _weight of the wings per kilogram of animal., for each group\ncharacterized by a different mode of flight. The results I obtained\n216\n\nare summarized in the following table, which orders the bird groupings according to tie relative weight of their wings:\nGroup\n\nBody\nWeight\n\n( g r)\n\nRelatil to Rela tive\n\'Weight of Weig ht of\nP lucket i\t\nWi ng\nUpper\nPeat hers\n\nelative\nWeight\nf Whole\nWings\n(gr)\n\nDiurnal Soaring Raptors\nNocturnal R/G Raptors\nftwing/Soaring Waders\nDiurnal Rowing Raptors\nSoaring Palmipeds\nRowing/Soaring Palmipeds\nRowing/Soaring Passerines\nRowing/Soaring Corvids\nRowing Columbidae\nTerrestrial Rowing Waders\nSwimming] Rowing Palmipeds\n, Waterside Rowing, Waders\nL.D.

The soarers and\nrowing/gliders with large wing surfaces have the highest wing weight\nper kilogram of animal. It is equal to a fifth of the body weight in\nsoaring and nocturnal raptors and to a sixth of the body weight in\nsoaring Palmipeds. In contrast, rowers with a small airfoil have\nthe lightest wings compared to body weight. Body weight is ten times\nthat of the wings in passerines and gallinaceae. For vibrating passerines, it is sixteen times greater.\nIt is fairly difficult to directly grasp the relationship between\nwing size and weight because it is pretty rare to find birds with\napproximately the same wing area belonging to different groups. However, I, have been able to gather together a few species in this\nsituation. The area and real weight of their wings are given in the\nfollowing table:\n\n217\n\nPA\'s\n\nBird\n\nWing\nArea\n\nWing\nWeight\n\nFirst Series\nCapercaillie (Rowing Gallihacea)\nRed throated Diver (Rowing Palmiped)\n\n1\t 41141\n\n24N1\n\n1\t 116\n\n181\n\nLittle \'Bustard (towing Whder)\n\nI\t t1111\n\n1:11\n\nCory\'s Shearwater (Soaring Palmiped)\nCommon Gull (Rowing/Soaring Palmiped)\nCarrion Crow ( Rowing /Gliding Corvid)\nMontagu\'s Harrier (So riin Raptor\nLongeared Owl (Rowing ^Gli^ing Raptor)\n\n1\t tNi11\n\n!N\'1\n\nt1ul\n\nlr.:\n\n1IMNI\n\n11i\n\n1\t I^NI\n\nIN\xe2\x96\xba\n\n>\n\n;III\n\n1\t\n\ni\t 11,^{\'_\n\nSecond Series\n\nl\n\nQuail t owing Gallinacea)\nJack Snipe (Rowing Fader)\nCrossbill (Rowing Passerine)\n\n172\n\n+.fil\n\n178\n\n4110\n.\n\nSwift (Rowing /Soaring\n\nIlia\n\n11101\n\nPasserine)\n\nAlthough the wing areas are not exactly the same, it is evident\nthat wing weight varies from group to group for wings of nearly the\nsame area. Thus, the capercaillie has wings that are four times\nheavier than the longearod owl\'s in spite of the fact that they are of\nequal size. Similarly, the quail has heavier wings than the swift.\nHowever, it is difficult to use this method to decide on the\nrelative lightness of wings in all the avian groups characterized by\ndifferent modes of flight. Another procedure is called for. To this\nend, I calculated the average ratios between wing weight and area for\nthe different groups. Ln the same way as in 3 the study of wing loads,\n\xe2\x80\x94\nI multiplied the ratios by the coefficients 7K contained in the table\non page 214.

There are birds with\nlight wings; the rowing passerines and the waders are in this category,\nThe nocturnal raptors are, too, which is the reason why they do not\nseem to expend great effort when flying even though they row\nfrequently. In addition, they caai fly silently thanks to the lightness of their flying apparatus. The soaring raptors have much lighter\nwings than soaring palmipeds, while diurnal rowing raptors, which\nflap their wings energetically, have heavier ones than soaring\nraptors. It certainly seems that all the birds that flyby means of\ncontinuous energetic flapping have heavy wings. They probably need\nthem for increased wingbeat efficiency. In these birds, the weight\nof the wings in relation to their surface area is at least one and\na half times greater than in other groups.\n\nRECOMMENDED READING\nDe Lucy, Le vol des oiseaux [Bird Flight.], Presse scient. des deux\nmondes\nDubochet, Recherches sur 1e vol des oiseaux (Research on Bird Flight),\nNantes (1134).\nHastings, Arch. nderland. des sciences exactes et naturelles !

The difference is that the birds with\nrelatively the most extensive wings are the ones with the smallest\nmusculature. Now, it is known from physiology that the work a\nmuscle is capable of is proportional to its weight. It is in fact\nobservable that the larger a muscle is, i.e., the more fibers it\ncontains, the stronger it is.\nFrom the study I carried out. on the wing and the pectoral\n\nmuscles, it turns out that soaring and rowing/soaring birds as a\nwhole have the greatest relative af\'-rfoil and the smallest relative\npectoral msucle weight. In contrast,the rowers exhibit a small wing\nsurface linked to large pectoral muscles. The pectorals\' relative\n\n221\n\n/158\n\nweight. varies by a factor of 4 in the carinates. In the true soarers\nit oscillates between 100 and 130, while it\'surpasses 200 and often\neven 300 in the rowers, whose source of propulsion is sometimes\nequal to a third of their weight.\nAs a whale, wing area and weight thus vary inversely with\npectoral muscle size as one moves from a group characterized by\none mode of flight to another group characterized by another mode.\n\nLooking now at the relative quantity of large and small pectorals, it is apparent that, generally speaking, birds with the\nlightest depressor muscles have small elevator muscles and large\nwings. In contrast, groups possessing large depressors have\nlarge elevators and small wings.\nDepressor Weight\n\nIt should be noted that the evident inverse relationship\nbetween the weights of the various pectoral muscles and wing area\nis not absolute. There are groups such as the rowing raptors and\nthe rowing/soaring passerines whose pectoral muscles, particularly\nthe depressors, are relatively large even though them: wings are\nfairly extensive also. All these facts are easy to explain. The\nrowers: passerines, waders, palmipeds, gallinaceae, and columbidae,\nhave moderately to very small airfoils. They cannot remain aloft\nexcept by rapidly flapping their wings. Their depressor muscles\nhave thus developed because of the muscular effort required by\nthis mode of flight.\nAmong the birds displaying well developed wings are the hobbies,\ncommon terns, and swifts. However, these gifted gliders often fly\nin a manner similar to ordinary rowers, with the aid of rapid and\nrepeated wingbeats. They all have very, pointed wings and consequently\nenlarged depressor muscles. Meanwhile, closely related species\nwith slightly larger wings, such as the kestrels, seamews, and house\nmartins, possess less voluminous muscles because their wingbeats\nare two or three times less frequent.\nIn contrast, all groups that fly with little or no wing\nmotion have relatively small depressors.\nThis is the way diurnal soaring raptors and soaring palmipeds\nfly. However, their depressors have not atrophied despite the\nabsence of wingbeats during soaring. As I have explained, the\ndepressors work during gliding to keep the body in an appropriate\nposition and make it oscillate about the wing axis.\nGiven that wing shape is related to flight mode and that it\nalso depends on the speed of flapping, the weight of the large\npectoral muscle has a direct relation to the number and rapidity\nof the wingbeats. This is true in every bird group.\n\n222\n\nThe effect of flapping on wing shape and motive power is so\nclear that it is possible to predict the nature of a bird\'s muscles\nsimply by observing how it flies.,\nFinally, let us add that species who make only short flights \t\nhave very reduced depressor muscles. Such is the case of the group\nmade up of arboreal passerines, who usually only flatter from tree\nto tree. Also in this situation is the diver group. These aquatic\nbirds rarely leave the water for the air. As a result of the\nminimal amount of work required of them, their depressors are even\nsmaller than arboreal passerines\'. The wren, for example, almost\nnever flies and lives in bushes and holes like a mouse. Its\nmuscles weigh less than those of all other flying creatures. In\nrheas, who do not fly at all, the weight of the depressor muscles\nis almost twenty times smaller than in soarers. This confirms the\ntheory of the effort needed to support the body during flight. It\nis precisely because its engine is too small that the rhea cannot\nleave the ground, and not because of an insufficient wingspread,\nwhich is as great as in many able fliers.\nElevator Weight\n\nLet us now look at th.,, results of a study of the small pectoral\n(supracoracoideus) muscle.\nSoaring birds only engage in rowing flight to ascend and to\nmaintain altitude in the absence of wind. Most often, they use\nrising or horizontal winds to soar,\nor they glide through the air with\noutstretched, motionless wings. In\nall cases, the muscular effort made\nby the large pectoral is minimal,\nand their power is reduced because\nof it. The same reasoning can be\nV4\nused for the small pectorals in\n^^ ^,tt.1\nsoarers. They are of small volume\nbecuase most of the time the wings\n2 j^ \xc2\xb1y^,L\n\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2a s\nare motionless and because the\nwings\' upstroke can be considered\nan automatic result of their large\nAv\nwing surface. Among birds with a\nsmall airfoil, the weight of the\nsmall pectorals is, on the contraryr ten times greater than in\nl.i .\nsoarers. In addition, their elev\nator muscles average close to twenty times smaller than the depressors.\none anomaly is gallinaceous birds,\nwho make rpaid and repeated wingFigure 236\nbeats. Their elevators are only\nRelative Size of Pectoral Muscles\nthree times smaller. However,\nAccording to Fligtit Mode\nthe elevators of birds in this\n1, Buzzard; 2, Mallard Duck 3,\nlatter group are more voluminous\nNorthern Guillemot; 4, Ringdove\nthan those of swifts because in\nM\t\n\n\'\'\n\n223\n\n159\n\nswifts the series of wingbeats are only several seconds long and are\nseparated by periods of gliding.\nRaising the wing therefore requires a considerable effort\nwhen the airfoils minimal. This is true even for birds who fly\nrarely, such as certain divers, or almost never, like wrens. Their\ndepressors are partly atrophied,but their elevators have remained\nvoluminous enough to allow them to thrust their wings upwards in\nthe course of the rare occasions they leave the ground.\n\nThe weight of the muscles is not the only thing influenced by\nthe type of flight. Their dimensions are also affected.\nI have reproduced in figure 236 the photographs of four\nlarge pectoral types found in birds. Their dimensions have been\naltered to those they would have if all the birds had the same\nweight.\nLastly, as I indicated during my first lesson, depressor\nmuscles, in particular, constitute a veritable wing stress indicator.\nThey enable a bird to know at ever; F instant the stress acting on \t\nits wings from the pull exerted on these muscles by the elevation\nof the wing. Among the sources of the pulling force are the action\nof the air or of ascending winds.\nPectoral Weight per jauare Meter of Wing Surface\nIt seemed to me interesting to discover more exactly what the\nrelationship was between pectoral muscle weight and wing area. I\nthus iTwestigated the muscle weight corresponding to a square meter\nof wing surface for each bird. However, as I have already remarked.\nthe ratios obtained by dividing a weight by an area are of no value\nsince they are the result of a mathematical contrivance. One will\nfind heat, generally speaking, the largest birds naturally have\nthe largest ratios, and the opposite will also be true. By using\nthe procedure I used for evaluating wine loading, I was able to\nobtain figures pertaining to birds of equalized size. To do this,\nI multiplied each real ratio of pectoral muscle to wing area by the\ndesired coefficient and I found the following weights:\nRatio of\nPectoral\nMuscle Wt\nto Wing\nArea\n(per m2 )\n\nNocturnal R/G Raptors\nDiurnal Soaring Raptors\nSoaring Palmipeds\nRowing/Soaring Waders\nRowing/Gliding Corvids\n\n2\'24\n\n0.610\n01.4,)\n+ \xe2\x96\xba,!NM)\nO.%H)\n11.970\n\nRatio of\nPectoral\nMuscle Wt.\nto Wing\nArea\n(Per m2)\n\nDiving Rowing Passerines\nWaterside Rowing Waders\nSwimming/Rowing Palmipeds\nRowing Columbidae\nRowing Gallinaceae\n\n2,140\n\n2,274 \xe2\x96\xba\n2,71NI\n3.4mm)\n\n4,170\n\n164\n\nRatio of\t\nPectoral\t\nMuscle Wt.\t\n\nRatio of\nPectoral\nMuscle Wt.\n\nto Wing\t\n\nto Wing\n\nArea\t\n(per m2 )\t\n\n( per m2)\n\n1,10711\t\nRowing/Soaring Palmipeds\t\nDiurnal Rowing Raptors\t\n1.1140\nRowing / Soaring Passerines\' 1.:1111\t\n\nL.D.

If one kg of muscle per m 2 is used as a unit of\npower, it will be found that the strength needed to move a square\nmeter of wing is greatest in hummingbirds and gallinaceae because\nof the number of wingbeats per second. It is ten times smaller for\nrowing/gliding birds, and is only a third or a quarter less in large\nrowers, like the pigeons, small waders, and ducks,\'who flap their\nwings only a little less frequently than the gallinaceae.\nHeart Weight\nI thought that it would be useful to study birds\' hearts.\nLike Parrot, I theorized that the heart hypertrophies to an\nextent depending on several factors, among which muscular effort\nseemed to me most important. In birds, the greatest muscular\neffort is made by the pectorals. The variation in heart weight\nmust consequently parallel that of the pectoral msucles.\nI weighed bird hearts completely drained of blood-.

A certain number of authors, such as Navier,\nhave tried to calculate, among other things, the work accomplished\nduring flight. Their results were invalid because they based\ntheir calculations on inaccurate data. At the present time there\nare no precise figures on this subject because of the lack of\nappropriate research apparatus.\n\n3\n1\t\n\n1\t\n\n1\t\n\n1\t\n\n^\t\n\n1\t\n\nj\t\n\n/\t\n\n(\t\n\nl\t\n\nl\n\n1\n\na\n4Z-\'2\n\xe2\x96\xba\t\n\n(\t\n\n1\t\n\nI\t\n\n\'\t\n\n1\t\n1\t\n\n1\t\n\n(\t\n1\t\n\n1\t\n\n1\t\n1.\t\n1\t\n1\t\n\n\xe2\x96\xba\t\n1\t\n1\t\n\n1\t\n1\t\n\n(\t\n1\'\t\n\nlb\n\n1\t\n1\t\n1\t\n\n1\t\n\n(\t\n\ni\t\n1!\t\n\xe2\x96\xba\t\n\ni\t\n\nI\t\n\n!\t\n\ni\t\n\xe2\x96\xba\t\n\n1\t\n1\t\nI,\t\n\n^\t\n\n1\n\n^\t\n1\t\n\n1\t\n1\t\n\n1\n1\n\n1\n\nj\t\n\n!\t\n\n1\t\n\n1\t\nI\t\n1\t\n\nt\n^\t\n\n!\t\n\n!\n\nl\t\n\ni\n\n\xe2\x96\xba\n\n\'\t\n\nI\t\n\nl\t\n\ni\n\nI\t\n\nt\n\n\xe2\x96\xba\t\n!\t\n1\t\nt ^\t\n,^1.__1 _i._ 1\t\n9 1 2 3 4 5 F. 7 8 9 10\n1\t\n\nFigure 237\nMagnan Apparatus for Studying\nBirds\' Pulling Capacity\nKey: B) Base\nF) Lower jaw of brake\nf) Upper jaw of brake\n\nf\t\n\n1\t\n\n1\t\n\n1\t\n\n!\t\n\nI\t\n\nt\n\nV "YS\n\nFigure 238\nExternal Power Curve\nof a Pigeon in Flight\nP) Large pulley\np) Small pulley\na) Kilogram-meters per kilogram\n\nEven though it is not yet possible to evaluate the power\nrequired by flight, it is easier to measure the extra work that can\nbe demanded of a bird. We have studied this question by employing \t\n\n226\n\nL* -\n\n/162\n\nnew equipment. For this purpose I used a modified version of the\napparatus F. Houssay and I designed in 1912 for determining the\nflight speed of birds, which. was already described above.\nA smaller wooden pulley was attached next to the large\npulley. A steel-shoed Prony brake was then mounted with two\nscrews dr. the smaller pulley ( figure 237). One of the screws\nis used to apply the brake through the intermediary of a coil\nspring. The brake \' s Lower jaw holds a lever arm at the end of\nwhich the free part of a spring scale is attached. The fixed\npart is linked to the base of the apparatus.\nIf the spring is tightened to close the brake shoes at the\nsame time as a bird in flight pulls on the thread and puts the\nlarger pulley in movement, the animal has to make an effort that\nvaries accordingto the friction of the shoes on the small pulley.\nThe intensity of this effort can be measured directly by reading\nthe graduations on the scale or by allowing the scale needle to\nmove along a cylinder -to make a recording.\nFrom the diameters of the two pulleys, the length of the\nlever arm linking the small pulley to the scale, and the equilibration of the brake, the pulling force made by the bird can be\nexactly determined. The animal \' s speed is recorded at the same\ntime, and with it all the elements necessary to calculate the\nexternal power developed by the bird are present: P = ,F x V,\nwhere F is the pulling force in kilograms and V is the corresponding\n\nspeed in m,/sec.\n\nHuguenard, Planiol, and I have recorded the speed and pulling\nforce of carrier pigeons at a predetermined point in their flight.\nHere are the results obtained:\n\nExtern.\n\nPigeon Speed Pulling Extern.

Based on the\ntable and graph., the maximum power developed, by carrier pigeons in\nour experiments was 2.6 kgm per kg of animal. This is equivalent\nto 1/30 metric horsepower, which for a 2,000 kg airplane would\ncorrespond to an excess power capacity of 69 metric hp.\nIt might be possible to learn about the power capacity of\nbirds by making them fly with greater and greater loads. The\nacceleration produced by their wingbeats could then be recorded\nand the birds filmed as they fly.\nSuch experiments have not yet been systematically carried out.\nMeanwhile, it is known that if 100 grams are attached to the tail\nof a 350 gram pigeon, it can still ascend at an angle of 11 0 . With\nsuch a load, a pigeon situated at 0.90 meters rose to 3.30 meters\nand then climbed to more than 12 meters: Pigeons fly with\ndifficulty when carrying a weight of 200 gr. This would indicate\nthat under these circumstances the excess power capacity of a\npigeon is not greater than 200 grams, or 70% of its weight.\nII. Avian Body Shape\n\n\t\n\n/163\n\nJust as the characteristics of birds are closely linked to\ntheir manner of flying, their body is also a result of an adaptation to airborne locomotion, and sometimes to a particular, lifestyle, in addition.\nThe Midframe Member\n\nAlix, without specifying \xc2\xb0fUt1hdr,had remarked that a bird\'s\ntrunk is egg-shaped, with the large end pointed forward.\n\nmay,.-^\t\n\nFigures\n\n2.39\n\n\'1\t\n\n\xc2\xb0\n\n& 240\n\nMidframe Member (Dotted Line) of a Raptor (Left) and a\nPalmiped (Right)\nI searched to find the form of the midframe member in birds\nby studying their vertical and horizontal projections. These are\nthe lines projected by a bird when it is lying on its side in the\nfirst case, and on its back in the second. I have discovered that\n\n228\n\nthe midframe member has the shape of a parabolic curve whose apex\npoints toward the head in an animal lying on its side and is\nlocated at the thickest point of the body, the middle part of the\nshoulder joint. When a bird is lying on its back the summit is\npointed in the opposite direction, toward the tail, and is situated\non the ventral line. The ventral point is forward on the body of\nbirds of weak motive power (figure 239) and is much further to the\nrear on birds having a large engine (figure 240). This is shown\nin the following table, in which the real distances between the\nventral point and the line passing through the anterior edge of the\nwings has been divided, by the cube root of the bird\'s weight.\nBuzzard\n\nSparrowhawk\nSeamew\nEagleowl\n\n0.40\n0.45\n0.50\n\n0.56\n\nGray Laggoose\nPartridge\nGuillemot\nMallard Duck\n\n0.65\n0.80\n0.80\n0.85\n\nBody Height\n\nI also sought to learn about body height and width with a\nset of outside calipers. The ratio of width to height has some\ninteresting features.\nWhen the ratio is greater than 1, the width is larger than\nthe height. When it is less than 1, the opposite is true.\nThis study showed that terrestrial soaring and rowing/soaring\nbirds, whose ratio is greater than 1, have a body that is flattened\nin the horizontal plane (figure 241). The same goes for truly\naquatic birds, such as soaring palmipeds, ducks, and divers. on\nthe other hand, the ratio is smaller than 1 in columbidae, gallinaceae, and waders. These last birds have large pectoral muscles\nand an elevated breast bone. That is the reason for the increase\nin body height. In rowing palmipeds, the flattening of the body\nin the horizontal plane, in spite of the well-developed pectorals,\nis due to the action of the water, which has elongated the pectoral \t\nmuscles and thus reduced their height. The results are very\napparent in figure 241.\nThe Center of Gravity\n\nI determined the locations of birds\' centers of gravity by\nthe method already described. The positions are marked on figures\n220 to 224.\nThe center of gravity of birds in gliding position is always\npretty much located in the transverse plane perpendicular to the\nmajor axis of the body and passing through the line of greatest\nheight. It is thus located far forward in soaring and rowing/\nsoaring birds. In rowers it is much further rearward. It always\n\n229\n\n/164\n\nf\t\n\ncorresponds to the anterior third of the wings for the first group\nand, as their flying and soaring ability improves, it gets closer\nto the anterior sixth,\n1.\n2.\n3,\n4.\n5.\n6.\n7.\n8.\n\nGoshawk\nEagle-owl\nSeamew\nRook\nPlover\nMallard Duck\nPartridge\nRingdove\n\n\xe2\x99\xa6 = major axis\n\xe2\x80\xa2 = center of gravity\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n2\n\n4\n\n3\n\n6\n5\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\t\n\n8\n\n7\n\nFigure 241\nRelative Body Height in Various Birds\nRowers, on the contrary, have a center of gravity located\neven with the wings\' middle region. The worse fliers they are,\nthe closer their center of gravity is to the line joining the wing\ncenters.\nFurthermore, the center of gravity is always on the dorsal\nside of the midpoint of the line of maximum height in the body.\nThe exception to this is certain birds with large pectorals, like\nthe gallinaceae, in whom it is below the midpoint. (See figure\n241.) In all birds, the center of gravity is in a horizontal plane\nbelow the one passing through the axis of the body, as the same\nfigure shows.\n\n230\n1\n\nLastly, the center of gravity is well in front of the line\ndetermined by the wing centers of accomplished gliders and is\neven with this line in rowers.\n\n/165\n\nIII. Avian Stability\nWe are going to end this lesson by studying avian stability.\nThis is a very interesting question. Unfortunately, there\n\nis very little information obtainable on it.\n\nWhat strikes an observer watching a bird glide in calm\nweather is that its displacement most often follows a straight\nline. When there is a wind, its movement is observed to be\nstable, i.e., when pushed off its path by a gust, it rapidly\nreturns to its former trajectory.\nIt is thus evident that a bird\'s motion is not constant,\nsince its progress can be disturbed by oscillations around\nits three principal axes, just like what happens to a\ndirigible.\nSuch an aeronaut can pitch, i.e., oscillate in the vertical plane about the transverse axis passing through the center of gravity, yaw, i.e., oscillate about the vertical axis,\nand roll, i.e., oscillate about its major axis.\n\nCorporal Weight Distribution\nIn a gliding bird., the longitudinal axis, Gx in figure\n242, is the major axis in the plane of symmetry. The axis\nGz is the minor axis in the median plane. In the bird\'s usual\nflight position, it is vertical. Lastly, the axis Gy is perpendicular to the plane of symmetry. It is the transverse\naxis.\nA bird, when it is gliding in a straight line, should\nautomatically, or by the appropriate maneuvers, put up the least\n\n231\n\nI III , I \'\n\nll 1 1 , 11\t\n\nIN 0 111001111111 M -111 , 11\t\n\n11\n\npossible resistance to moving forward. This occurs when its major\naxis is parallel to its trajectory and when its plane of symmetry\nis held vertical.\n\nFigure 242\nAxes of a Bird\n\nR\n\n^\t\n\n,,.\n\n^rrr:T;^?^\xe2\x96\xba\xe2\x80\xa2rr-r?^-sue\n\nFigure 243\nPath of a .Well-\n\nCentered Glider\nKey:; A) Swoop\nR) Flattening out\n\nFigure 245\nFigure 244\t\nPath of a Less Well Path of a Poorly\nCentered Glider\nCentered Glider\t\nTu) Uniform trajectory\nTo) Undulated trajectory\n\nIf a small well-centered glider, i.e. one whose weight is well\ndistributed, is dropped from a certain height, it will swoop until\nit achieves its maximum flight speed. It then noses up and follows\na straight, somewhat slanted line (figure 243).\nIf the glider is less well centered, it noses up more. Its\nspeed diminishes, and it performs a new swoop to once again attain\n\nbe almost vertical after the swoop. It then makes a loop, then a.\nvertical dive and the phenomenon starts over again. (figure 245).\nTo stop the glider from nosing up like this, the front must\nbe weighted down. This has the effect of reestablishing proper\nbalance.\nIn birds, such automatic nosing up in calm air is never ob\nserved during gliding because they are dell-centered. However,\nbirds do not have a rigid form like gliders. They can, as we\n\n166\n\nhave seen, change the position of their wings during flight.\nThus, good gliders hold their wing tips in a forward position\nwhen they are moving slowly. This moves the center of gravity\nforward a little. When they are gliding rapidly, they flex\ntheir wings so that the hand joint is very far forward and the wing-\n\ntips are pointed rearward. The center of_ gravity is then pushed\nforward even more, which\nequivalent to loading the animal down\nin front. Moreover, birds can also change the position of their\ncenter of gravity along their major axis by lengthening or shortening their necks and by changing the position of their feet under\n\nis\n\ntheir bodies.\nFurthermore i birds have at their disposal a caudal surface\nof varying size.\n\nThe Caudal Surface\n\nBirds\' tails are mechanisms for establishing balance while\nflying through the air as well as acting as a brake when landing.\nThey are generally shaped like a sector of a circle. The point\nis located where the retrices intersect, and the external curvature\nvaries in magnitude. A few species possess a bifurcated tail\nthat is always in motion because of the incessant veering undertaken by the birds. Such movements are the cause of the changes\nnoticed in the tail configuration of kites, American swallowtailed kites, swifts, terns, swallows, frigatebirds, etc., all of\nwhom perform a type of flight \t\nnumerous \'rapid maneuvers.\nSome interesting information can be drawn from the study I\nmade of birds\' tail dimensions. I weighed the rectrices, measured\ntheir length, and calculated the tail area by spreading them out\nwhile taking care that the feathers remained imbricated as in\nnature. I related this data to body weight, length, and surface\narea, so as to have comparable figures. I also determined the\nratio between wing area and tail area.\nSince I only studied birds whose tail played no ornamental\nrole, the following average ratios retain their total import from\nthe point of view of flight.\n\n233\n\no-^\n\nWe will see, by -examining the following table, that there\nexist two distinct series of birds:\n1) Series A, formed by species flying above dry land, in\nwh,m the various ratios involving the tail are always fairly\nlarge, even though they vary somewhat. On the contrary, the ratio\nof wing area to tail area is fairly small. Tail length also seems\nto be linked to wingspread. The tail is large in birds with elongated wings, but it is usually smaller in birds having short wings.\nThis is the reason why the gallinaceae have relatively poorly\ndeveloped tails.\n\n2) Series B, made up of birds used to flying in watery\nregions, and who have to deal with strong air currents. Their\ntails are small, while the ratio of wing area to tail area is\nvery great.\nRATIO\t\n, RATIO Body\n\nRATIO\n\nTail \'RATIO Wing\n\nBody Tail Length Wt per Tail Area\n\nWt.

Figures 220 to-224 illustrate this\nvery clearly.\n234\n\n/167\n\n\t\n\nThe large tail of soaring raptors plays an important role in\nsoaring. It constitutes a third wing in the sense that it supplies\nlift. It aids the animal to stay aloft while circling and at the\nsame time assures its longitudinal stability. Its ablation has the\neffect of unbalancing the bird\'s flight.\nIn marine birds the caudal surface: is mulch, reduced because of\nstrong air currents. However, the tail is\nthe action of\t\nnevertheless one of their most important organs. My observations\nhave shown me the major role played by the tail in the course of\nmaneuvers performed by marine soarers. Constantly extended during\nflight, the tail is used to initiate either ascents or glided\ndescents, as the animal desires.\nThe tail is very large and well-developed in rowers such as\nthe hobbies, _swifts, and hummingbirds, whereas it is such smaller\nin such aquatic birds as soaring palmipeds. This supports the\ndistinction that can be made between factors causing the almost\nidentical narrowness in the wings of both groups. It confirms that\nthe action of .. air currents is at the source of the reduction in\nwing width and tail length among aquatic birds.\nLastly, notice that diving birds have extraordinarily small \t\ntails. They are smaller than the tails of other birds who frequent\nmarshes and shores but do not lead an aquatic life. It is known\nthat fishes have a tapered posterior end and that the tapering of\ntheir hull is a consequence of the action of the water.\nI have shown that molding by water happens to diving birds in\nan identical fashion. The posterior part-of their bodies becomes\ntapered and their rectrices are reduced in length and weight,\noften to the point of disappearing completely. That is as true for\npalmipeds and waders as it is for such diving passerines as kingfishers, whose tail has a relative length of 1.1, compared to an\naverage of 2.3 in other passerines (figure 246).\n\n1\t\n\n_l\n\nFigure 246\nRelative Caudal Areas of: 1, Blueback; 2, Hummingbird; 3, Kingfisher\nThe Action of the Wind\n\nBirds seem well balanced for gliding, and they follow a\nlinear downward trajectory, as we have seen.\n\n:4\n\n.235\n\n/168\n\nRolling and yawing are never observed during glides in still\nair.\n\nAs soon as a wind comes up, especially if it is fairly\nstrong, the situation changes. Flights are then observed in\nwhich the ahi,mal oscillates markedly\nthe vertical plane\n(pitches), and oscillates laterally or rolls. The passage of disturbances stronger on the left than. on the right side of a bird\nis enough to make it perform balancing maneuvers similar to those\nof tightrope walkers.\n\nin\n\nTo regain lost longitudinal and lateral equilibrium, a\nbird first resorts to its caudal surface, which it can augment or\ndiminish at will. In addition, the tail can be raised or lowered.\nThis enables a gliding or soaring bird to remain on a linear.\ntrajectory. As for countering a loss of lateral balance, a\nbird\'s wings can be banked to one side or the other at will. This\narea can also be increased or decreased. Finally, a bird can lower\nits hand section to stop rotation around its major axis. This\nis something airplanes cannot do.\nBirds are thus wonderfully rigged for maintaining a satisfactory flight stability and an ,impeccable straightness of flight\ntrajectory.\nAll this is only from observation, and almost nothing else is\nknown about the balance of birds in flight. It is widely recognized\nthat they manipulate their wings and tail to create eccentric\nforces that act on the body as a whole. It is further known that\nthe action of the air on the wing and tail surfaces creates a\nhorizontal torque parallel to the trajectory of a bird\'s major\naxis that forces its median plane back to a vertical position.\nWhen a bird moves rapidly in still air, the action of external\nforces is significant enough that it can to a large extent dampen\nthe nascent oscillations. When the bird moves more slowly, these\nforces are weaker and generally no longer suffice.\nThe Moment of Inertia\nAir resistance exerts a dampening influence on the oscillations\nof a bird\'s body and causes its trajectory to more and more closely\napproximate a straight line. Do not forget, however, that in\naddition to this useful influence there is the baneful influence of \t\nthe moment of inertia, which increases oscillatory amplitude,\nespecially when there are sources of perturbation and thus of\nheightened instability present.\nThere have never been any experiments done to gather information on this question or to establish a suitaL-le theory of balance\nfor a bird in, flight.\nI have begun research aimed at determining birds\' moments of\ninertia.\n236\n\n/169\n\ni\n\nin a rotating bird suspended from a post by a, string attached\nto its center of gravity, the period is linked to the bird\'s\nmoment of inertia about the axis of rotation passing through its\ncenter of gravity. Knowing the period thus allows one to deduce\nthe magnitude of the moment of inertia. The duration of a complete\noscillation of a material body suspended by a torsion wire around\n\nwhich it turns is:\nt -21r Ic,\nwhere I designates the moment of inertia, and c is a constant\ndepending on the wire employed.\nTo determine a bird\'s three moments of inertia in relation\n\nto the three principal axes passing through its center of gravity\nexperimentally, I operated in the following fashion:\nI constructed a circular aluminum plate\nwhich had been lightened considerably by cutting out numerous holes. Four copper wires\nwere fixed to this plate, which only weighed\n100 gr. The four wires were in turn attached\nto another wire hanging directly over the\ncenter of the plate. This last wire served\nto suspend the apparatus from a cross piece.\nI first made the system oscillate and noted\nits period of oscillation. I then placed\ntwo 100 gr weights 10 cm from the center of\nthe plate and measured the oscillatory period\nanew. With that completed, I undertook the\nstudy of different bifds\' moments of inertia\nin relation to their three -axes. Each animal\nwas prepared as for the determination of\nFigure 247\ncenters of gravity and was placed on the\nEquipment for\nplate stomach up and wings spread out. \t In\nMeasuring a\nthis way, its center of gravity was located\nBird\'s Moment\non the axis of rotation.\t (See figure 247.)\nof Inertia in\nThe animal was then attached below the plate\nRelation to the\nso that first its major axis and later its\nVertical Axis\nwingspan were positioned on the axis of\nrotation (figures 249 and 249).

Many very interesting papers were read at this\nconference, which was attended by such German scientists as Karman,\nGoergii, Hoff, and Proli.\nI went to Darmstadt as a representative of the Ministre de\nl\'Air [Minister of Aviation] $ the College de France, and the Comitd\nfrangais de propagande adronautique [ French Committee on Aeronautical\nInformation] headed by Marshal Lyautey. In this capacity . I delivered\na lecture on air turbulence.\nWhat is perhaps mo-t striking in such a conference is that\nhuman attempts at soaring have not just laid the basis for such\nremarkable sporting performances as those of the German Kronfeld, who\nclibmed to 2,160 meters above his point of departure and made a trip\nof 150 km in his motorless aircraft "Wien." They have also resulted\nin very important scientific studies and technical progress. Indeed,\nwithout this progress no sporting performances would have been possible.\nCareful studies have led not only to well designed, highly\nefficient airplanes, but also to a deeper knowledge of the atmosphere through which gliders as well as powered aircraft maneuver.\nOnly ten years ago, the properties of the atmosphere did not interest technicians any more than if they didn\'t exist at all. We are\nnow beginning to understand how great is the influence of atmospheric\nmovements on motorized aircraft. This influence can be very undesirable at times since certain atmospheric disturbances accelerate\nairplanes as much as classic acrobatic maneuvers do. All this\nprogress we owe to the study of soaring.\nAs we saw during the introductory lesson, while some nineteenth century engineers sought to build motorized craft to carry them\nthrough the air, other researchers attempted to unlock the secrets\nof bird flight. They tried to imitate the birds by slipping through\nthe air without any motive force besides their own weight and that of\n\ntheir apparz,tus\n\nAll of us have witnessed how a pilot confronted with an engine\nbreakdown in midflight attempts to land properly. He allows his\ncraft to descend under the effect of its weight and tilts its wings\nto make the best possible use of air resistance. This is what is\ncalled "gliding descent" and is practiced all the time by birds wishing to land on the ground. Through the action of their weight, both\nairplanes and birds conserve speed while they maneuver to approach\nthe earth. In calm weather, an airplane with an engine that has\nstalled at a given height can thus land within a circle whose radius\nbecomes greater as the airplane\'s aerodynamic efficiency [lift/drag\nralCio]- increases. (See figure 250.) However, the fact is that under\nthese circumstances, airplanes and birds lose altitude when gliding\nin still air. They des4.^and constantly.\n\n240\n\n/172\n\n\':fw._S,a\t\nt 1\t\n\n64 WA\n\nFigure 250\nThree Gliders Descending in Calm Air with Efficiencies\n3, 4.5, and 6, Respectively\n\nFigure 251\t\nThe Lilienthal Glider (1893)\t\n\nof\n\nFigure 252\nThe Lilienthal Glider (1895)\n\nNineteenth-Century Attempts at Motorless Flight\nAmong the men who have tried to imitate birds, the German Otto\nLilienthal stands out. An aircraft constructor in Berlin, he undertook a conscientious study of birds and of the environment in which\nthey flew. He fabricated well-braced artificial wings attached to\ntwo horizontal rudders forming a tail and a large vertical rudder\n(figure 251). The wings were nade of a wicker framework over which\na light fabric was stretched. Lilienthal tried to use this glider\nfor soaring. Securely fastened to the center, with his legs hanging\ndown, he launched himself against the wind from the top of a small\ntower. His method of maintaining balance was to change the inclination of his body under the wings. He succeeded in making some remarkable flights, including a few exceeding 300 meters. However, he\nnever did more than glide; soaring remained beyond him.\n\n241\nk\'\n\ni5\n\nIn 1896 Lilienthal wanted to perform some new tests on a biplane glider (figure 252). In the course of his thousandth experiment he fell 80 meters and died. Despite this tragic accident,\nLilenthal\'s experiments excited a few followers. A Frenchman\nliving in New York. Chanute, did similar experiments and built the\nfirst stabilizers (figure 253). One of ,Lilienthal\'s students,\nPilcher, also continued his teacher\'s experiments (figure 254),\nbut he too was killed, in 1899. Also in 1899, Captain Ferber\ncarried out a series of airborne experiments on glider equilibrium\n\n(figure 255) .\n\nAll these experiments yielded useful information. Two Americans,\nthe Wright brothers, bicycle makers in Dayton, were thus able to perform the first human-bird test flights. They made numerous flights\nin a biplane glider they constructed (figure 256). Thanks to some\nsuccessful modifications they then created the first powered air-\n\nplane.\n\nht^,\n\nt\t\n\nN^.t\n\n/173\n\nFigure 253\n\n\t\n\nThe Chanute Glider\n\n...\t\n\n\'^-^\xe2\x80\xa2^ `.\'g`.r .... w. \' r .::i. ;. \'^\t\n\n\t\n\n..\'Y...-:..--fir\n\n\t\nFigure 255\n\t\nThe Ferber Glider (.1899)\n\n242\n\nFigure 254\nThe Pilcher Glider (1899)\n\nFigure 256\nThe Wright Glider (1902)\n\nFrom that time on, most engineers concentrated only on improving\nmotorized airplanes. Meanwhile, a few, like the German Harth\n(figure 257) and myself, nevertheless continued to be interested in\nsoaring and devoted themselves to trials of powerless aircraft of\ntheir own design.\n\nFigure 257\nThe Harth Glider (1914)\n\ns\t\n\n`\n\nFigure 258\nThe Magnan Glider (1914)\nThe glider I designed was patterned after soaring raptors.\n(See figure 258.) I presented the results of my experiments to the\nCongrts des Societas savantes [Congress of Learned Societies) on\nAugust 16, 1911. The airplane was designed to weigh 150 kg including\nthe pilot, and could weigh as much as 200 kg when carrying experimental apparatus. Here are some of its dimensions:\nWingspread\t\nAverage Wing Width\t\nTotal Length\t\n\n11.90 m\n1.82 m\n4.75 m\n\n243\n\nWing Area\nTail Area\nLoad. per m2\n\n15.20 m2\n2.5 m2\n9.8 kg\n\nThe vehicle had oval, almost ,rectangular, flexible wings, the\nexact form that the wings of soaring: raptors have. They were also very\nthick, especially in the half closest to the fuselage, and had a\ngutter--like curvature of large radius. In these ways they also\nresembled soaring raptors\' wings-. I still thank that this kind\nof motor.less aircraft is the most appropriate for flights in rising\nwinds and is better suited than the high aspect ratio craft developed.\nby the Germans.\nFor these soaring experiments, I also invented an apparatus to\nindicate automatically if the aircraft was ascending or descending,\neven only slightly. The instrument includes a closed cylindrical\nbox sealed at one end by an elastic membrane on which a needle is\nmounted by means of a special arrangement. At the other end is a\ntube connecting the interior of the box with the surrounding air.\nThis opening to#he outside is controlled by a timing mechanism so\nthat it is closed 9 seconds out of 10. When the tube is open, the\nair pressure inside the box is the same as that on the outside.\nWhile it is closed off, the external air pressure might change because\nthe apparatus was ascending or descending and there would no longer\nbe an equal force on each side of the elastic membrane. A deformation in one direction or the other would ensue. It would be manifested by a displacement of the needle toward the right during an\nascent and toward the left during a descent. The sensitivity is\ngreat enough that the needle\'s displacement would be easily visible\nfor a gain or a loss of only 1 meter in altitude. Thanks to this\napparatus, a pilot will know 9 seconds out of 10 whether he is rising\nor falling, and consequently if he is still in a propitious zone or\nis leaving it. He can even automatically prolong his flight by this\nmeans. These experiments, even though known to the public, did not\ninterest the experts of the period. On the contrary, their remarks\nwere rather sarcastic. They thought that to borrow from nature to\nbuild a machine was an unjustified extrapolation. This was based on\nthe long-standing claim that beyond a certain size, birds are\nincapable of flight. It was argued that large birds are obviously\ninferior to the others in terms of flying ability because of the\nrelative decrease in wing size as weight increases. This is a\ngroundless assertion since, as I have proved., it is based on a\nmathematical contrivance. The example of the ostrich, who weighs\n75 kg and does not fly, has been advanced to support it. The\nostrich\'s inability to fly has nothing to do with weight, since small\nflightless birds like the kiwi or near-flightless ones like the wren\nare known to exist. For all of them, it is the consequence of an\nadaptation to a particular life-style that has little by little made\nflight unnecessary. Actually, it is easy to prove that size is no\nobstacle to airborne locomotion.\n\n174\n\nAs I have already mentioned, the great pterodactyls and the\npteranodons existed in America during the Cretaceous period. Their\n\n/175\n\n244\n\nwing-spread attained 9 meters and, as I indicated, their weight must\nhave been about 300 kg. There thus used to be flying creatures as\nHeavy as airplanes. Even heavier fliers than those we know about\nmight have been living then. If there are no fliers as heavy today,\nthat is not because a bird weighing more than 15 kg cannot fly, but\nis due to other causes. The experiments of Harth and myself did,\nhowever, prove to researchers the existence of significant rising\ncurrents on windward slopes. They were large enough that a powerless aircraft did not lose altitude. There was therefore no reason\nwhy soaring could not be accomplished in such winds. At this point\nthe war intervened to put a stop to all research.\nGerman Experimental Flights in 1920 and 1921\nImmediately after the war, the Germans, who were deprived of\nmotorized aircraft, got reinvolved in such oxperi\'ments and successfully made some astonishing flights, even if they were of short\nduration. The first results were due to a judicious choice of\nterrain. To succeed, it was indispensable that no matter what the\ndirection of the wind, strong enough rising currents existed in the\narea. The Germans chose the region around the Rhnn Mountains, which\nsuited them perfectly, as tle future was to prove. The launching\nterrain was a plateau that dominated the neighboring region in every\ndirection with gentle, treeless slopes and valleys wide enough to prolong the flights. In addition, facilities were planned for the\npersonnel and equipment. Vehicles, for the most part constructed by\nstudents, were reassembled there. Some were gliders of the Lilienthal type. The best performance they achieved at first was a flight\nof 52 seconds covering 450 meters. Other devices included small,\nmotorless gliders copying the design of motorized monoplanes, or\noccasionally of biplanes. By 1921 skids were used as landing gear.\nLaunching the gliders was first accomplished by teams pulling on a\nrope while running against the wind. At takeoff, the rope was automatically detached.\nThe principal achievements were the following:\nA\nA\nA\nA\nA\n\n5 min 5 sec flight by Koller covering 4 km;\n5 min 33 sec flight by Martens covering 3.8 km;\n13 min 3 sec flight by Klemperer covering 2.8 km;\n15 min 40 sec flight by Martens covering 7.5 km;\n21 min 27 sec flight by Harth.\n\nIn this last flight, the difference in altitude between the\nhighest and lowest points was 400 meters. Figures 259 and 260\ndepict some of the craft used.\nThe 1922 French Experimental Flights\n/176\nHere and there public opinion became interested in these performances. As early as 1922 the Association frangaise adrienne [French\nAviation Association] organized a soaring demonstration at Combegrasse.\nx,\n24\'5\n\nThis was at the moment when the German aviator Hentzen made a 3 hour\nflight above the slopes of the Rhon (figure 261).\n\n^ 1\n\n_T f\nVL\n\nFigure 259\nThe Harth-Messerschmidt\nGlider (1920)\n\n^- . ...\nFigure 260\nKlemperer\'s "SchwarzeTeufler" Glider (1921)\n\nx\n\nf\nFigure 261\nHentzen\'s "Hanover" Glider\n(1922)\n\nFigure 262\nBossoutrot\'s Glider\nat Combegrasse (1922)\n\nThe majority of the apparatus located at Camp Mouillard was\ncomprised merely of Farman\'s "Mosquito" piloted by Bcssoutrot (figure\n262), the Coupet mo: , oplane, and the other biplanes, which ,ere ordinary airplanes with their engines removed or had been built without\nany particular improvement over motorized airplanes. Only Dewoitine\nhad come up with a flexible wing aircraft of new design (figure 263).\nThe gliding flights made by these vehicles were in reality no\nlonger than any good aviator could accomplish with a machine of the\nperiod. Only Bossoutrot succeeded in staying in the air for 5\nminutes, at the end of the conference.\n\n246\n\nFigure 263\t\nThe Dewoitine Glider (1922) \t\n\nFigure 264\nAirflow around a\nMountain Peak\n\nIt is certain, however, that better performance could have\nbeen obtained at the conference in Clermont-Ferrand from several of\nthe craft sent of the region. The pilots who launched themselves\nfrom the summit of the Puy de Combegrasse should have been acquainted with the techniques of soaring, the structure of the wind they\nmight encounter, and how to maneuver in air currents. As it was,\nthe pilots taking part in the conference were flying gliders that for\nthe most part they had not yet tried out. They thus did their\napprenticeship at Clermont-Ferrand and it was for these reasons that\nthey were mostly unable to carry out experiments other than exercises\nin gliding.\nAirflow around a Peak\n\n/177\n\nAs we know, when layers of horizontal wind encounter a cliff\nor slope, turbulence arises in the lowest layers at the foot of the\nobstacle. Meanwhile, the other layers are deflected upward and over\nthe edge of the cliff.\n\nintensity\n\nThe part of the rising current having the highest\nis\nfront of the cliff\'s upper edge. The section which is the\nlocated\nbest for soarers is at least equal in width and\nheight above the\ncliff\'s edge to the height of the obstacle itself. Behind the cliff,\nand above the ground, an unfavorable zone exists which is the site\nof much turbulence.\n\nin\n\nin\n\nIf the cliff or slope is of considerable width, a rising sheet\nis encountered. I repeat, the sheet does not have a significant\ncross sectional area, but spreads along before the obstacle in the\nform of a slice of rising air.\n\n247\n\n\t\n\nin contrast, if the wind comes across an isolated peak, the airflow is not exactly the same as in the preceding case. (See figure 264.)\nIf the windward slope is not too steep, the current follows its surface fairly closely and pretty much retains its normal, speed. At\nthe top of the hill this portion of the wind continues its upward\nclimb, but is pushed back downward fairly rapidly by the upper\nlayers of the air current. A complex phenomenon occurs; While the\nlower layers of the displaced air mass are deflected from the horizontal in the same proportions as the ground is, the layers a little\nfurther up undergo a much less significant deviation because they\ncan more easily flow around the summit. The rising current is more\nlimited here, as a result of the eddies formed can the sheltered side\nof the hill. It is furthermore never detectable high above the hill.\nThis is precisely the reason that the French aviators at\nCombegrasse found themselves in the presence of highly circumscribed\nrising currents of weak intensity.\n\nI1\t\nr 3 r\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nr\t\n\ni\t\n\xc2\xbb! +\t\n\n^\t\n\n^\t\nd\t\n\n+4 + \xe2\x96\xba 1_\t\nerr\t\n\nyC^\t\n\n\xe2\x96\xba \'\t\n\n`^trt\n^ ^;. ^ yr r >\n\na\n\nFigure 265\nIncorrect Maneuvers for Soaring above a Slope or Peak\n\nDrifting along Cliffs\nAt the time, we in France were also entirely ignorant of soaring\npractice. on taking off from a height and continuing along a straight\ntrajectory perpendicular to the cliff\'s edge as soon as a suitable\naltitude and speed are attained with the help of a shock cord-catapult,\' the narrow propitious zone is quickly entered and left with\nout any benefit being obtained from the rising wind. (See figure\n265.) This is another reason why the uninformed French pilots at\nCombegrasse could only perform gliding flights.\nSince an elevated area is an unfavorable zone for soaring because of the eddies and turbulence existing there, shock cords \t\nshould be used to acczuire a certain initial speed and height for\nentering the favorable zone. After the slight gain in height during\n\n248\n\n/178\n\nlaunching, the soaring aircraft is still in the unfavorable zone and\ndescends to some extent as it advances toward the right.\n\nh\xe2\x99\xa6\n7.\n\n^,\t\nA M.4\t\n\n^ ^ ^. \xe2\x80\xa2 I\n\nJ! 1^\xe2\x80\x9e\n\nOT\nL\n\nFigure 266\nNecessary Maneuvers for Soaring above a Cliff or Slope\nAt the moment when the aircraft\npenetrates the rising zone., it begins\nto gain height.

He took off\nin a strong wind at 2:32 and attained a height of 50 meters. He\nthen drifted along the cliff for 3 flours 30 min before he was forced\nto land because of darkness. He thus beat Hentzen\'s record by 10\nminutes.\n\n.\n\xc2\xab. 4 \xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\n4\t\n\n^TIT.t J<\n\nr ^\n\nFigure 268\t\nThe Peyret Glider\t\nPiloted by Maneyrol\t\n\nFigure 269\nThe Schultz Glider\nduring its Record\nFlight\n\nIn January, 1923, at Biskra, Thoret soared for 7hours 3 min\nin an ordinary airplane with its engine turned off.\nThen, on January 29, 1923, Maneyrol remained above the cliff\nat Vauville for 8 hours 4 min 50 sec. On January 31 of the same.\nyear, Barbot unofficially pushed the limit to 8 hours 36 min at\nBiskra.\nOnly sixteen months later the German builder-pilot Schultz \t\nperformed a powerless flight along the slope s bordering the Baltic\nlasting 8 hours 12 min 9 sec ( figure 269). Lieutenant Thoret\nbettered this record on August 29, 1924 \t i n a stalled Hanriot\n.\nH.D. 14. He successfully flew over the Alpines for 9 hours 4\nminutes at a height of 500 meters above the ridges.\n\n/179\n\nSince then, Commandant Massaux has increased the record to\n10 h 20 min and Dinort made a night flight above the Rositten dunes\n\n250\t\n\ni\n\nlasting 1.4 h 43 min.\nIt should be pointed out that flight duration records no\nlonger have much significance. If there is a continuous,\nsuitable wind in a region of uneven terrain, a pilot can theoretically remain in the sky for days. His performance now depends\nonly on his endurance.\n\nDistance Records and the Influence of Gaps\nT\nin contrast, flights alone cliffs and slopes can only be\nextended indefinitely with difficulty because of the very nature\nof coastal or mountainous terrain.\nGaps frequently exist in cliffs,.for example. Although the\nwind rises before the cliff ;itself, it rushes into valleys almost\nhorizontally. A veritable unevenness in the distribution of the\nneighboring air layers ensues. Those that have been deflected\nby the cliff in the vicinity of this funnel are abruptly pulled\ndownward. The result is violent eOdies that give rise to ascending\ncurrents on the edges of the gap and toward the center of the holes\nin the air. (See figure 270.) The influence of the rising currents\ncan be felt up to a certain altitude. They make traversing valleys\ndifficult for motorless aircraft.\nVarious attempts were made with this in mind. Thus, in 1923 \t\nLieutenant Thoret set a record for linear distance with an 8 km\n250 m flight above the Vauville cliff and the sea.\nAt the same time that they were striving to increase the\nduration of flight, the Germans were trying to establish longdistance records as well. On September 29, 1923, Botsch, in a\nvehicle with a wingspan of 18.7 m and an aspect ratio of 15.6,\nleft Wasserkuppe and successfully followed ridges of hills from\n4 to 500 meters high so as to make the best use of the terrain for\na flight of 19 km.\nHirth, in 1925, made a flight of 29 km at Vauville. Since\nthen, the Germans have done much better, but under other conditions.\nAltitude Records\nLastly, other experimental flights were made to attain the\nhighest possible altitude in rising obstruction currents. It\nseems that the greatest height above the point of departure attained\nso far was 250 meters in 1927.\nBorn in France in 1922, motorless flight has since then been the\nobject of fewer and fewer tests in our country. In 1925, a demonstration again took place, this time at Vauville. There were some\ninteresting appar a tus -to be seen there, including Abrial\'s\n"Vulture" (figure 171), which was piloted by Auger during its\nperformance. Since that period, nothing was accomplished until\n1930, when a society, Avia, affiliated with the Comitd frangais\n251\nii\n\n180\n\nde propagande aaronautique, tried to revive motorless aviation.\nBy contrast, in Germany, studies were pursued without interruption. Our neighbors have succeeded not only in perfecting\nthe techniques of soaring above mountain slopes but have also\ncreated a new mode of powerless flight which will be described in\nthe next lesson. (It should be pointed out that the pilot: Thonet\nis also past master of soaring above mountains since he keeps\nflying over the peaks of Mont Blanc in his motorized airplane by\nusing areas of rising currents to increase his ceiling.)\nY stated in 1922 that to soar satisfactorily, particularly\nin rising currents, three conditions must be met:\n1) An appropriate, efficient aircraft mualt be built=\n2) The rising winds capable of increasing the craft\'s\naltitude must be studied;\n3) Piloting techniques in such winds must be developed.\nBy fulfilling these conditons, the Germans were able to\naccomplish flights of a new order in 1929.\n\n<\t\n\nr.\n\n4\n\n\t\nFigure 270\n\t\nAir Flow in a\t Gap\nin a Cliff\n\n252\n\nFigure 271\nThe Abriel Glider Piloted\nby Auger at Vauville\n\nRECOMMENDED READING\nAbrial, "Les efforts frangais pour le vol saris moteur" [French\nWork in Motorless Flightl, Vort a.

The Study of Rising Winds in the Vicinity.-of Clouds\n\nIn another area, several scientists in France and elsewhere\nhave shown that below cumulus clouds a rising air current, sometimes of considerable magnitude, always exists.\nPersonal Research\nI myself, in the course of my studies on the structure of\nwinds rising as a result of the heating of desert ground, have\nobserved a predilection for such currents in certain locations.\nOne can almost always see a white ball, a sort of cumulus cloud,\nabove hillocks in Tunisia when the temperature and humidity are\nhigh enough. This is due to the existence of a rising humid air\nmass in tLose elevated regions. The air mass cools down at a\ncertain height, thus causing the water vapor within it to condense. I have indicated that hillocks are points where thermal\ncurrents are easily created. They are frequently visible near\ncumulus clouds above the peaks of the Pont du Fahs region. They\noccur in midsummer, especially when the temperature exceeds 350.\nA:iother area in which thermal currents can be seen is above the\nelevated points of the Kair.ouan and Medenine regions.\nAt certain moments, particularly when storm clouds are approaching at t_he s,ltme time as there is a horizontal wind, the formation\nof vertical swirls of sand in desert regions strongly heated by\nthe sun is noticeable. They are tens of meters in height and\nresemble the whirlwinds that constitute the chimneys of rising\nthermal currents. Such whirlwinds are forced along by the horizontal wind, if there is one, and move at the wind\'s speed without\nbeing appreciably altered. We observed them several\ntimes in the desert between Graiba and Gabes.\nWe have seen several lined up one behind the other and moving\nwith the wind over a course of several kilometers.Since 1925 we have been able to study such currents with our\nhot wire apparatus, the anemometer and inclination indicator.\nMy observations, made in collaboration with Huguenard and\nPlaniol, showed that air currents in the desert around Medenine\ndisplay a marked. ascendence above ground level ranging up to 150\nand even 29 0 (figure 272). Near the ground they are practically\t\nhorizontal. In addition, they exhibit much less agitation near\nthe ground than higher up. The vertical speed of such winds\nvaries from .4 m/sec to 4 m, /sec.\n254\n\nLL\t\n\n_P\n\n!!!\n\n77\'_\'7.. _ __ - _\n\n/182\n\nAlthough nobody paid much attention to these findings in\nFrance, some German professors, such as Georgii, sought to extend\nthe existing body of kno7ledge about thermal currents.\n\nFigure 272\nSpeed (1) and Inclination (2)\nRecordings of a Rising Desert\nWind at a Height of 10 m\n\nFigure 273\nType of Cumulus Cloud\nAssociated with\nRising Winds\n\nGeorgii\'s Research\n\nFrom the very beginning the Germans understood that the problem of soaring is a problem of aerology and could only be resolved\nby a scientific study of the atmosphere. This was the reason for\nthe 1922 proposal to create a meteorological observatory on Wasserkuppe directed by a physicist. It. mission would be to study how\nwinds ascend in the vicinity of the Rhon Mountains.\nA research institute directed by Professor Georgi.i was thus\nfounded on tie summit of Wasserkuppe on April 1, 1925. The Institute was composed of four sections:\n1) A section studying aeronautical technique;\n2) A section studying aerodynamics;\n3) A section studying meteorology\n4) A school of soaring.\nThe meteorological section had two subsections. One made\ntest flights and ascents to report finding to the national weather\nservice. The other had the mission of studying air currents on\n4Tasserkuppe and at Rossitten.\n\n255\n\nLab+:ly, Georgii was also a professor at the engineering school\nin Darmstadt. This led to the creation of a specialized course of\nstudy not only for the students in Darmstadt, but also for other\n\t vacations for applied and\nGerman students who came during\nscientific courses.\nThis organization enabled the Germans to,pursue research on\nthe nature of air currents, especially onfhe vertical movement of\nair under cumulus clouds (figure 273) and in the vicinity of storm\nclouds.\nTo study rising currents at high altitude, the Institute\nfirst used a light 20 hp airplane piloted by Nehring. As soon as\nhe saw a cumulus \'cloud, the pilot ascended with the aid of the\nengine to an altitude of 2000 meters. He then stopped the propellor and tried to stay under the cloud without losing height. He\nwas finally able to do this. Once,the pilot successfully supported\nhinself under a cloud without using the propellor for ten minutes\nand even gained altitude.\nProbing the Atmosphere by Meteorograph\n\nThe results encoura g ed the Germans, who then proceeded more\nscientifically. They used the well-known meteorograph which simultaneously records on the same paper atmospheric pressure, temperature,\nand relative humidity. Even though this instrument is not very\nprecise, it provides some interesting information. among other\nthings, it indicates that the temperature curve, which theoretically\ndecreases with altitude, has periods of leveling off and even of\ninversion in the vicinity of and inside of cumulus clouds. This is\nan important finding from the scientific point of view because it\nindicates that air density might have unsuspected variations.\n\n\t\nFigure 274 \t\nMeteorogram Made\nin Calm Air \t\n\nFigure 275\nMeteorogram Made Under\na Cumulus Cloud\n\nThe instrument furthermore revealed by examination of the\npressure curve that the sinking speed of the airplane was frequently\ncompensated for by the vertical spend of an air current. Thus,\nin 1928, Nehring observed ascending currents of 4 m/sec. The\nairplane which, with its propellor stopped, would have had a\nvertical falling speed of 2 m/sec, actually rose at a speed of\n2,m/sac as a result..\n256\n\n/183\n\nFigure 274 represents a recording giving the variations in\npressure during an airplane\'s normal descent or ascent. Notice\nthat the airplane rose with its engine and then descended in a\ncontinuous fashion with its propellor off. In contrast, the\nfollowing recording (figure 275) proves that during the power\nless descent, the airplane remained at the same altitude under a\ncumulus cloud for 10 minutes with the aid of the rising current it\nencountered. Similar tests have shown that there are also rising\ncurrents in front of storm clouds.\nThe studies undertaken led one to believe that when a squall\npasses over:, the sail cools down and a cold air current arises\nbetween the cloud and the ground. The current might flow toward\nthe front of the cloud and force the warm air it finds there upward. What is certain is that there do indeed exist such rising\ncurrents. They sometimes have vertical speeds on the order of 6 to\n7 m/sec, and are extremely turbulent.\nThe Determination of Airplane Trajectories in Germany\nThe study was carried still further. Each experimental flight\nwas the object of measurements made from the ground by teams seeking\nto plot the airplane\'s trajectory as it maneuvered near the clouds.\nNot only was wind speed_ measured, not only was the vehicle\nsighted at regular instruments by theodolites or telemeters, but\ncinemagraphic recordings were also taken by Or. Raethyen. He\nused an instrument he himself built along the lines of the one we\ndescribed previously. At first it occurred to Raethyen to construct a coordinate grid made up of three panels. The movie\ncamera was composed of a lens that received the rays coming from\nthe airplane and projected them through.a prism onto a sensitive film,\nThe rays coming from the coordinate grid crossed a second lens and\nwere projected onto the film by a second prism.\nLater on, he set up a second apparatus that used a film sensitized on both sides. On one side the image of the airplane was\nrecorded; on the other the image of a spherical network placed\nbehind the camera was picked up.\nFinally, Raethyen simultaneously obtained both images on the\nsame film in a manner similar to our own method.\nThanks to these experiments, it is possible through photographic restoration to derive an airplane\'s trajectory and vertical\nspeed (whether ascending or descending), as well as the vertical\nspeed of the wind_.\nFigures 276 and 277 show that an airplane flying beneath\ncumulus clouds encounters rising winds whose vertical speed sometimes attains as much as 4 m/sec.\n\n25\'7\n\n/184\n\nmay,, .,. .. _ ...\t\n\n..,......\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2... u\n\n2(0\n200,\n\nI\n\na,+Go,\nL\n\nii-ruo^1.. u..\n\n.,^k\n\n,rvrir.\t\n\nrrmr^ as\n\n._.._.\n\n74\n\n1 r01\na-\n\n^\n\nL\n\n1\n\niIi\n\nAna\n\non\nn\n\n(F"\n\n\t\n\n^^` ^`\' ^ ^ 1^..^(rrvgrap^\n\n4\n\nr"\n\n^\n\n_\n\ns\n\n^rsrr^^u(riG\nIIB 2U 2? ?^ 2G ld JD 32 34 3G 3UA\'itP.40\n\nFigure 276\nTrajectory of an airplane\nwith Propellor Stalled\nPassing under Cumulus\nClouds\n\nFigure 277\nAnother Trajectory of\nan Airplane with Propellor Stalled Passing\nunder Cumulus Clouds\n\nKey: a) Height in meters\nb) Climbing speed\n\nc) Sinking speed\n\nd) Meteorograph\nThe studies undertaken documented the nature of air currents\nnear clouds and showed how they were constituted. It was thus\nestablished that below cumulus clouds and in front of squall lines,\nthere are always rising winds, which in the latter case can attain\n7 m/sec. Ira. addition, the universal existence of inversion phenomena was demonstrated. This means that on one side of a certain\nline the current ascends whereas on the other side the current is\ndescending.\nII. Motorless Flight in the Vicinity of Clouds\n\nThe Germans were not content with justscientific findings.\nThey tried to make use of the rising currents below cumulus clouds\nand especially infront of squall lines to make long distance and\nhigh altitude flights. When soaring in rising obstruction currents,\nthe heights attained are always small, 100 to 300 meters, depending\non the obstacle\'s form and height. The flights do not last very\nlong, either, because of usually insurpassable discontinuities in\nthe elevated areas traversed.\nKegel had already made a flight in a storm during 1926. He\nclimbed to 600 meters and covered a distance of 28 km. The tests\ndemonstrated that to succeed it sufficed to take advantage of the\nclouds\' currents. First, one climbs by means of rising winds dues\nto slopes. Then either one reaches the ascending air layers on the\nlower surfaces of cumulus clouds or one remains hovering in the sky\nawaiting the arrival of the updrafts preceding storm clouds.\n\n:T4\n258\n\n/185\n\nThe possibility of powerless flight in these circumstances was\ndemonstrated by Hirth, Groenhoff, and Kronfeld.\nHirth\'s Flight from Wasserkuppe to Schweinsberg (1928)\n\nIn 1926 Iiirth climbed over the slopes of Wasserkuppe and drifted above the hill to a height of 400 meters.\nThe experimenters of the Rhea and their measuring team employed\nthe same procedures to determine the trajectory of the powerless\naircraft as were mentioned previously for motorized airplanes. They\ntook all the required measurments along with the time the measurements were made. Whenever possible, they also sought to learn the\nvertical speed of the wind encountered.\n\ni. ,^5.,_...,,/ ^^:tiw^^ /..+n.\xe2\x80\xa2^ arr=7-r \xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\x94^\t\n3\t\n\n^.rT\t\n\nI..\t\n\na\t\n\nA\t\n\n^fl-- ,...A\t\nN _3219.1 1 .^\n\nw\t\n\n.y rrt: i<.r..\n\nFigure 278\nTrajectory of Hirth\'s Glider from Wasserkuppe\nto Schweinsberg and Back\nThey were thus able to trace Hirth\'s path in the aircraft\nThis path is reproduced in figure 278. Notice that the\n"Lore"\t\npilot glided from the altitude at which he was located above Wasserkuppe in an atterapt to reach a cumulus cloud above Schweinsberg.\nAs soon as he was below the cloud, he found a propitious rising\nwind that enabled him to zigzag back up to a height of 300 meters.\nFrom there, he made a gliding descent and lost much altitude until\nhe reached the slopes of Holstein and took advantage of the rising\nobstruction currents existing there. He regained altitude, maneuvered around Milseburg, descended slowly toward Weiherberg, climbed\nback up with the aid of the mountain slope wind, and made a final\ngliding fight to his point of departure on Wasserkuppe. The part\nof the flight made with the aide of mountain slope currents is\ntraced with a solid line. The part performed using currents under\nclouds is represented by a dotted line. The numbers represent the\nelapsed time in minutes.\nK ronfeld\'s Flight to Himmeldankberg, (1928)\n\ni\n\nIn 1928 Fronfeld elaborated the method to use for long distance\nflights involving rising cumulus winds during his voyage from Wasserkuppe to Himmeldankberg in his glider " Rhongeist". After takeoff\nthe German pilot first maneuvered through the ascending wind on\n259\n\nWasserkuppe \' s west slope at an altitude a little higher than his\npoint of departure. When a passing cumulus cloud helped him climb\nto 170 meters, Kronfeld followed the cloud in a SE direction. He\nthen found himself in Wasserkuppe \' s, descending wind, but since he\nwas still under the cloud, Kronfeld was able to remain in the\nrising wind by maneuvering appropriately. He thus attained 430\nmeters above Wasserkuppe. As the cumulus cloud disintegrated,\nhe tried to glide to Himmeldankberg. Once there, he remained for\n\xe2\x80\xa2 fairly long time in its ascending slope currents. The passage^of\n\xe2\x80\xa2 new cumulus cloud enabled Kronfeld to abruptly ascend anew, and\nhe returned to Wasserkuppe by taking advantage of rising currents\nhe found on the way.\nI s 148 kin\n\n\t from Wasse rku ppe to Gera b e_fore _a Squall\n\nIn May, 1929, by applying all the information acquired through\nthe research of the Rhbn Institute; Kronfeld performed a flight of\n100 km. Skirting Teutsbourg Forest, he made his trip, sometimes\nusing rising slope currents, sometimes updrafts under cumulus clouds,\nin order to cross valleys.\nOn July 20, 1929, Kronfeld accomplished a new feat. The day\nwas stormy with i ntermittent squalls. Storm clouds covered the\nentire Rhon range around 3 o \' clock. Kronfeld launched his aircraft the "Wien," whose aspect ratio was 22, i n a wind of 10 m/sec\nand reached the slopes of Pelzner, where he started to lose altitude. The pilot Hirth was already floating at 1000 meters in front\nof a strong squall line. Kronfeld directed himself toward Ehrenberg, his altimeter indicating a continuous ascent below a cloud\nand in the middle of lightning flashes. His vehicle, which was\nbadly shaken and tossed about, kept rising and it tacked in circles\nup to 3,000 meters. Kronfeld flew with the storm, which was advancing rapidly northward, and arrived above Geisa. Below him small\nwhite clouds were forming, indicating the presence of rising\ncurrents.\nThe pilot flew around above Berkh and broke into the area in\nfront of the storm. On turning around, he noticed that the cloud\nhaC split in two. - :e was them caught up in a descending wing and\n1\npushed lightly on the stick in an attempt to reach the storm on\nthe east. The vehicle picked up speed and the indicator showed\n70 km / h. Pulling on the stick did nothing to reduce its speed,\nwhich reached 120 km/hr. The glider was caught in the tempest and\nwas cracking all over. It suddenly found itself under a cloud in\nfront of the storm and above Gotha after having crossed the\nThuringian mountains. Kronfeld gradually learned what distance he\nhad to remain in front of the squall line so as not to lose height.\nAfter flying for an hour toward the east, he passed over Erfurt and\nWeimar. The night was falling, and he was still at an altitude of\n2000 meters. He therefore decided to land and touched down near\nGera, 148 km from Wasserkuppe.\n\n260\n\nL-\n\n/186\n\n\t\n\n\t\nFigure 279\n\t\nBarogram of Kornfeld\'s \t\nFlight from Wasserkuppe\nto Gera (1929)\n\nS\t\n\n^ dry:,\t\nr .\n\n1 I ^.r\t\n\nI\xe2\x80\xa2 .M rte\n\n.1\t\n\n1 :\t\n\nFigure 281\nFlying in Air Current\nInversions Near a Storm\n\npia+\t\n\n(>\xe2\x80\xa2^^^ t\t\n\nt,\t\n\nP,\n\n^. ,\xe2\x80\xa2 +..\t\n\n[\'^ ^^"`\'^^ \xe2\x80\xa2y ; T \t\n\n1^.jIt\t\n\nla\n\n,^ " .^ \', ja \xe2\x80\xa2.^\t\n^\n\nl4\n\na i, a ^ ti.\t\n{l\t\n\n)\n^\n\n4\'i.\t\n\n\'\t\n\nt\t\n\nIet\n\nV % Oi\n\nl"`\'\n\n4\n\n/\t\n\n-^^\t\n\n\'^\t\n\n.\xe2\x80\xa2 4)y\n\nttit 1\t\n\n^^i:_ ,, ;\n\n/ Se\n(\n\n\'y\n\\ 1\t\n\n\\ ,: x^ r\t\n\n.I^ r; a^iT\t\n\n`,^ , ^ .,t\t\n\n^\xe2\x80\xa2../..y^\n\na^^\'C4n L.\n\n^ , ^, + tip.\t\n\n1 i ^\t\n\n1.\n\t\n\n^ .I\t\n\n4.,\n\nJ\n//\nllel\n\nFigure 280\nSuccessive Storm Fronts during Kornfeld\'s Voyage from\nWasserkuppe to Gera (1929)\nFigure 279 represents the barogram of Kronfeld\'s flight. Notice\nthat after an ascent followed by a descent, the aircraft steadily\ngained height in the squall line\'s wind and reached an altitude of\n3,000 meters. It was then above Eisenach, and the time was 4:20 P.M.\nThe wind\'s greatest ascent took place between 1400 and ISM meters.\nThe pilot then flew horizontally at 3,000 meters for an hour. After\nthat, he descended and flew between 2,100 and 2,400 : peters for two\nhours before landing.\nFigure 280 shows the various positions of the squall line from\n\' AUGINAL PAGE IS\nOF POOR QUALITY\t\n\n261\n\nhour to hour.

The solid line in the figure represents the trajectory \t\nKronfeld followed in front of the storm, with departure from Wasser-\n\nZL87\n\nkuppe and landing near Gera.\nThe Nature of Winds in a. Squall Line\nThe diagram in figure 281 shows how to fly before a squall\nline. The flight is divided into three parts:\n\nThe pilot must approach the squall line after being launched\nabove a slope and makivg maximum use of the rising currents due to\nthe presence of cumulonimbus clouds. The arrows indicate the\ndirection and inclination of the air current in the vicinity of\nthe cloud. Note the lines of inversion. on one side the wind is\nascending, on.the other it is descending_. The glider follows\ntrajectory I and climbs with the aid of ascending wids until it\nreaches the cloud\'s upper edge. \'There is a slight rising current\nin front of storm clouds at this location. As is indicated in\ntrajectory II, flying against this current will keep the glider\nat the same height and position relative to the cloud. Higher up,\nthe aircraft would \'lose altitude. In order to descend,the glider\nmoves away from the cloud and dives to reach the. ground. It should\nbe pointed out that in the case of such a storm cloud, three lines\nof inversion are encountered. The result is that below the cloud\nmass, there is a descending wind and that to the rear a descending\ncurrent preceding an ascending current can be found.\nld\'s 150 km Flight from Wasserkuppe to Lienlas below Cumulus\ns\nTen days after his first performance, Kronfeld made another\nvoyage through the use of the updrafts observed under cumulus\nclouds. This flight took place on July 30th in a westerly wind of\n12 m/sec. The cloud ceiling was about 5010 meters above Wasserkuppe.\nThe glider climbed rapidly immediately after departure and disappeared in the cumulus clouds (figure 282), which were several\nhundred meters thick. It ended up on the cloud\'s upper surface.\nThe glider thus went from 950 to 3,100 meters in 22 minutes, which\nrepresents a rising speed of 2 m/sec. It then glided downward,\neither in a straight line or in circles above clouds, and reappeared\nbelow the cumulus clouds. It now flew horizontally with the aid of\t\nthe wind existing there. When night fell, it landed after a\nseries of curves at Lienlas, near Bayreuth and not far from the\nCzech border. This was 150 km from its point of departure. (See\nfigure 283.)\nFigure 284 represents the barogram recorded during the flight.\n,One can see that the glider surpassed an altitude of 3,100 meters,\nhaving therefore gained 2,160 meters, and then flew for a long time\naround 3,000 meters. Descend l.ng to around 1,200 meters, it traveled\nthere for an hour. Another drop brought it to 800 meters, where\n\n262\n\n/188\n\nit remained for two hours without appreciable loss of height.\n\nFigure 282\nKronfeld\'s Trajectory around Cumulus Clouds from\nWasserkuppe to Lienlas (1929)\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2!\xe2\x80\xa2!..

The climbing speed was\nhigh almost the entire time. It reached 5 m/sec between 2,200\nand 2,800 meters, when Kronfeld was crossing a cumulus cloud.\nThe dotted curve is that of temperature, which decreased\nregularly at first, but displayed oscillations within the cloud\n\nmass.\n\n263\n\n\t\n\nd\n\nc,\n\na\n\no\ni\n\nr1\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\n\xe2\x96\xba x,\n\n,ypr^ .>^r i\t\n\n1 tiW ^\t\n\n06\n\n,\n\nlire\t\n\n1\n\na.

Bedau\'s flight did not surpass\n1,700 meters. Groenhoff\'s carried him to 2,100 meters, after\ncrossing through the cumulus cloud. Examination of the temperature\n/189\ncurve (figure 286) -shows that there were the same oscillations as \t\npointed out above. In contrast, the ascent curve does not indicate\nvery great climbing speeds in general. The exception is inside the\ncumulus cloud, where extremely large variations cocurred between\n1,700 and 1,900 meters. In this area the wind exhibited first\nascending and then descending motion of -9 m/sec, +10 m/sec, -3.9 m/sec,\n+3.6 m/sec, -2.2 m/sec, and +7.7 m/sec in less than 2 minutes.\nRemember that these flights inaugurated a new method of\nsoaring, They make possible trips over any territory, even flat,\nand for potentially great distances on the conditon that the departure is made in rising obstruction currents. This enables the aircraft to reach either the bottoms of cumulus clouds or squall lines.\nIt is not without interest to point out that in 1925 the pilot\nAuger got into his glider the "Vautour" [Vulture] and rose above the\nslopesof Vauville. He was then blow in the direction of Cherbourg,\n\n264\n\na\n\nfar from the zone of rising current above the cliff, at the same\ntime as he rose to an altitude of 720 meters. This performance,\nwhich was due to rising thermal winds, was not followed up because\nits cause was not understood.\n\n265\n\nT\n\nRECOMMENDED REAMING\nFrancais de Propagande Adronautique, Le vol a voile\nL 3oaring), (1930).\nGeorgii, "Der 10 RhOn-Segelflug -- Wettbewerb auf der Wasserkuppe\ni.

I recently gave Painlevd\'s\nopinion on this question. He demonstrated very soundly that air\nresistance to a very oblique descent made by a glider is proportional\nto both its vertical sinking speed and its horizontal speed. Neither\nthe slope of a downward glide nor its vertical speed can ever be less\nthan a certain limit. The lower this limit is, the more remarkable\nis a glider\'s aerodynamic efficiency.\n03nsequently, a glider launched from a hill, for example, loses\naltitude as it glides in still air, i.e. when there is no wind, at\nthe same time as it advances horizontally. The existence of the two\nsimultaneous movements means that the glider falls toward the ground\non a downwardly inclined trajectory.\nIt is easy to understand from previous discussion that the\nsmaller the slope o f the trajectory, the better the glider\'s flight\ncharacteristics. There are, meanwhile, two ways of looking at the\nglider\'s characteristics, depending on whether one is considering\nthe slope of the glide or\xc2\xb0the sinking speed.\nIn the first case,- the better a glider is, the less height it\nloses when covering a given horizontal distance. If it drops 10\nmeters in a horizontal distance of 200 meters, it is superior to\nanother glider that covers only 100 meters while losing the same\namount of heiqht. The first glider descends at a 5% slope and has an\naerodynamic efficiency of 200/10 = 20. The second glider descends\nat a slope of 10%, two times larger, and displays an aerodynamic\nefficiency of 100/10 = 10, which is two times smaller.\nIf we now compare gliders accord_ng to sinking speed, i.e.\nthe amount of height lost per second while gliding, we must recognize that an apparatus that approaches the earth at l m/sec is\nbetter than one which approaches it at 2 m/sec.\nThe\nlaunched\nfly in a\nmountain\n\nconclusion we can draw from this is that if two gliders are\nfrom the summit of a mountain dominating a large plain and\nstraight line, the one that lands the furthest from the\nis the better of the two. (See figure 250;) Similarly,\n\n267\n\nthe one with the smaller sinking speed or that took the longer time \t\nto touch down is more flightworthy than the other. This is true so\nlong as both tray\xc2\xb1ctories were straight and the pilots maneuvered in\nthe same fashion, for by changing the wings\' attack angle, pilots\ncan also change the angle the trajectory makes with the ground.\n\nVend\n\nA\t\n\nIOM/s\n\n10\n"A;\n\nFigurFa 287\n\nFigure 288\n\nVertical Sinking Speed BA,\n\nHorizontal Speed\n\nAC and\n\nTrajectory BC of a Glider\nwith an Efficiency of 10\nin Calm Air\n\nTrajectory AG\'\'\n\nof the Same\n\nGlider Flying in a\n\nHead Wind of 5 m/sec\n\nKeyi. as Wind\nFigure 287 makes it easy to find the slope of a glider in\nrelation to the ground, no matter what the direction of the glide.\nIn the right triangle ABC, BA is the sinking speed, 1 m/sec; AC\nis the horizontal speed, 10 m/sec; the slope is the ratio between\nAB and AC, or 1/10, which is the reciprocal of the aerodynamic\n\nefficiency, 10.\n\nG liding in a Reg ular Horizontal Wind\nThe situation-is no longer the same if there is a wind. We\nare going to examine this point in detail for the case of a horizontal wind assumed to be uniform and regular.\nAs Col. Paul Renard stated so well, a fundamental notion that\nis often lost sight of because it runs co Ater to common sense must\nbe kept in mind here. As long as a glider or any other aircraft\nremains on the ground, it responds to the wind like all things\nlocated on the surface of our planet. When it is released in the\natmospr,;vre, it no longer belongs to the earth, but to the air. In\nthi% new situation, the wind does not exist for it, and in its eyes\neverything happens as if the air were calm and the earth moved under\nit with a-speed equal to the speed of the wind, but in the opposite\ndirection.\nLet uz take the example of a glider in flight. possessing are\naerodynamic efficiency of 10, i.e, it descends 1 meter in still air\nfor every 10 meters of horizontal distance it covers. If it is\nsuddenly placed in a uniform.horizontal head wind of 5 m/sec, the\nglider\'s horizontal speed in relation to the air will not change,\nbut its spA,^-_d in relation to the ground will now be 10 - 5 = 5 m/sec.\nIts sinking speed will not be chanced either, although its forward\n\n268\n\n191\n\nspeed was divided by two. The net result is that the slope of its\ntrajectory will be two times greater, as is shown in figure 288.\nThe higher the wind, speed is, the closer the glid\'er\'s trajectory\nwill approach a vertical line. When the speed of the headwind\nequals that of the glider in still air, its trajectory in relation\nto the ground will appear vertical. If the wind\'s speed is more\nthan the glider\'s, the glider seems to go backwards it the air\nwhile losing altitude at the same time (figure 289).\n\n/192\n\n_A\n_C\t\n\n10\'"/a ^\xe2\x80\x94T C\n\nS "%a ^l\t\n\nWind\n\nt `a "\'/s\n\nFigure 289\nTrajectory AC\' of the\n\nSame Glider in a Head\nWind of 15 m/sec\n\nWind\n\ns.\n\n15 "\'/s\n\nFigure 290\nTrajectory AC\' of the\nSame Glider in a Tail\nWind of 5 m/sec\n\nIf the motorless aircraft is now placed\xc2\xb0 a.n tail wind , of the\nsame strength as the head wind was, the sinking speed is once\nagain unaffected. The horizontal air speed also remains tree same:\n10 m/sec. However, relative to the ground its speed becomes\n10 + 5 = 15 m/sec. because the horizontal speeds of the glider and\nthe wind are additive in this case. The slope of the glider\'s\ntrajectory will consequently be modified, as indicated in figure\n290. The slope in relation to the earth will seem less inclined\nthan in still air. It will appear to be 1/15 instead of 1/10.\nTo conclude this account, a glider\'s vertical speed relative\nto either the earth or the air is not influenced by the presence.\nof a uniform horizontal wind. This is also true for its horizontal\nair speed. In contrast, the horizontal ground speed will be changed\nby such a wind. The slope of the trajectory will be altered to a\nconsiderable degree, without the gliders ever being engaged.in anything other than gliding.\nGliding in a Regular Updraft\n\nLet us now consider the case, no longer of a uniform horizontal\nwind, but of the horizontal wind after it has encountered a cliff,\nwhich has forced its layers upward even though they remain regular.\nThe resulting inclined wind also displays two components ofvelocity.\nOne is horizontal, and the other, called the rate of climb, is\nvertical. Consid.er\'the behavior of our glider with an aerodynamic\nefficiency of 10 in still air and a sinking speed equal to 1 m/sec,\nIf the updraft encountered sometimes has a 1 m/sec rate of climb\nand sometimes a .5 m/sec rate, there is no change in the air speed of\nthe glider. However, relative to the ground, the motorless aircraft\ndescends at 1 m/sec while the first wind raises by the same amount\nand the second by half that amount, .5 m/sec. In the first case, the\ntrajectory becomes horizontal (figure 292). In the second case, the\nslope is reduced by half, and the sinking speed is now .50 m/sec\n269\n\n(figure 291). If we suppose an updraft with a vertical speed of\n2 m/sec, the same aircraft, with an efficiency of 10, will rise\nrelative to the ground with a speei equal to the difference between\nits sinking speed in calm air and the air current\'s rising speed:\n2 - 1. = 1 m/sec.\nThe same reasoning applies to gliders maneuvering in rising\nthermal currents with or without horizontal wind (figure 293).\nObviously, this is exactly the opposite of what would happen\nif the wind were descending rather than rising.\n\na\n\nVent\n\nFigure 291\nTrajectory A\'C\'\nof a Glider of\nEfficiency 10 in\na .5 m/sec\nRising Wind\n\nFigure 292\nTrajectory AC\' of\nthe Same Glider\nin a 1 m/sec\nRising Wind\n\nFigure 293\nTrajectory AC\' of\nthe Same Glider\nin a 2 m/sec\nRising Wind\n\nKey: a) Wind\nGerman Glider Types\n\nThe result of all this is that there is much interest in building\nhighly efficient gliders for flying in updrafts. The advantage of\nan aircraft with an efficiency of 20 in comparison to an apparatus \t\n/193\nwith an aerodynamic efficiency of 10 when using such currents\nis easily understood. The first vehicle only needs a wind\' with a\nrate of climb of .55 m/sec to go upward, while the :second\nrequires that the rate of climb be greater than 1 meter. The first\ncan therefore accomplish feats forbidden tothe second. The Germans\nunderstand this very well in developing their gliders, which at\npresent are of two types:\n1) Training gliders;\n2) High-performance gliders, or sailplanes.\nThe training gliders are themselves_ divided into two series:\na) Student gliders for teaching pilots how to fly motorless\naircraft. They are very sturdy and easy to repair. Their wings\nhave a low aspect ratio, about 6, and are attached to a triangular\nframework on which is mounted the pilot\'s seat and the landing skids.\nThe engineer is not much concerned with aerodynamic efficiency when\ndesigning them. The emphasis is on safety and stability in flight.\n\n270\n\nThis is why all these vehicles are provided with very effective\ncontrols and have relatively small loads per square meter. They\nare instruments for students (figure 294).\n\nFigure 294\nThe Training Glider " Zbgling" in Flight\n\ny-^\nt max...,\t\n\n7tyM^7^\n\n\t\ni\n\n^\t\n\'\t\n\n.{\n\nr y J.\n\n\'r\t\n\n1\n\nFigure 295\nPlans of the Glide; "Zogling" in Flight\nb) Practice or training gliders which form a transition between\nthe previous group and sailplanes.\nIn contrast, the so-called sailplanes, which are all very solid\nmonoplanes that can nevertheless be easily taken apart, are always\nbuilt very carefully. Their airfoil varies from 15 to 20 m 2 , their\naspect ratio ranges from 12 to 24, and their aerodynamic efficiency\nfrequently attains 20.\nThe Rhon-Rossitten Gesellschaft itself constructs all three \t\ntypes of gliders, whose plans it sells.

It\nshould also be recognized that the sailplanes, in particular, display a certain high quality from the point of view of construction.\nIt is the result of long study and merits attention.\ni\nM\n\nGerman Glider Construction Method \t\nUp to 1923, all long distance motorless aircraft were patterned\non the motorized airplanes in service: monoplane, biplane, and\neven triplane. Sometimes they did have a special form, like\nManeyrol\'s "Peyret" (figure 298) or the occasional glider whose\nfunction was already a little specialized. An example of the latter\nwas the "Vampyr" which had almost rectangular and fairly deep wings\nand no landing gear, in the proper sense of the word (figure299).\nBy 1924, motorless aircraft with a larger aspect ratio \'Were introduced in Germany. One such glider was the "Ronsul" (figure 300),\nreally the ancestor of the 1928 and 1929 gliders. It had a very\nlarge aspect ratio and very thin wing tips.\n\n* t t ^ ^. \' ^\t\n\n}r ^\t\n,;\n\n:`f t^ r J\t\n\nfit\' ,\'7\n\n,: r^\nk`t\xc2\xb0)\tAso\t\n\nFigure 298\nDesign of the Glider " Peyret"\n\nFigure 299\nDesign of the Glider "Vampyr"\n\n273\n\n_314,\nj\n\nFigure 300\nDesign of the Glider "Konsul"\nCurrently, all the better German gliders have practically the\nsame form. The latest models are monoplanes with overhanging wings,\nand their aspect ratio is generally 19. Sometimes their wings are\nstill. braced. The airfoil is most commonly made up of three parts.\nThe rectangular central seciton is close to the fuselage while the\ntwo others are more or less triangular and form the wing tips. They\nalso support the ailerons, which are almost as long.\nA single box spar, most commonly accompanied by a dummy spar,\nsupports the wing ribs, which are simple spruce or kieffer (a kind\nof pine) rods. The ribs are connected to each other by a latticework made of the same wood (figure 301), and the whole assembly is\nglued together without nails.\n\ni\n\nFigure 301\nRib of a German\nSoaring Glider\n\nFigure 302\nWing Pylon,and Method\nof Attaching the Wing\nof a German Engineless\nGlider\n\nThe wings are partly , covered by a wide, highly elastic sheet\nof alder and birch plywood, which constitutes the attack edge at\nthe same time. The rest of the wing is covered with a fine fabric.\nThe fuselages of the Germans\' sailplanes are very light. They\nare composed of frame members joined together by plywood sheets and\nhave a very small cross sectional area, just sufficient to hold a\nman of average weight. In the front there is always a cockpit sealed\n274\n\n/196\n\nby a piece of plywood that can be removed for inspecting the vehicle.\nIn the middle is a streamlined pylon against which the wing is held\nflat by two fasteners on the wing spar and one on the leading edge\n(figure 302). In the rear is a sort of very elongated cone at the\nend of which a large tail unit is mounted.\nThe central landing skid is located below the fuselage. It\nis sort of an ashwood sole, Its form follows that of the keel, and\nit serves to brake the vehicle agains-the ground.\nThe fuselage of such gliders is generally 6 meters long, 1\nmeter high, and 50 cm wide.\nThe entire ,assembly is as well varnished as a piece of furniture\nfrom a good craftsman.\nAt present, the better German gliders weigh between 100 ind\n150 kg when empty. Their airfoils have an area of 16 to 20 m , and\ntheir aerodynamic efficiency often attains 20. An updraft of less than\n1 m/sec is sufficient to cancel out the effect of gravity on them.\nIn the research and development of their machines, the Germans have\npaid particular attention to reducing sinking speed, and they claim\nto have sometimes lowered it to below .80 m/sec.\n\nFigure 303\nDesign of the Glider"Darmstadt II"\nSailplanes\n\nHere are a few supplementary comments on some of the German\ngliders that have accomplished exceptional flights. They are all\nmore or less similar to the Professor type,\n1) The\'Darmstadt II", which is a version of the "Darmstadt I"\ndesigned by Wolker and was sent to America for public and private \t\n/197\ndemonstrations. However, it is inferior to its predecessor. Provided\nwith a larger aspect ratio than the older one, a wingspan extended\nto 18 meters (figure 303), and a wing in three sections, it seems\nto be not as good because of its wing profile, which is said to be\npatterned after tb q ,flat Jonkowski type. Piloted by Nehring, it\nhas nevertheless made some impressive flights.\n\n275\n}\n\n\xc2\xab\n\nFigure 304\nDesign of the Glider "Westpreussen"\n2) The "Westpreussen", the engineer Hoffmann\'s machine, which\nhas a completely overhanging three-part wing and has been piloted\nsuccessfully by the pilot Schulz (figure 304).\n\nC_\n\nFigure 305\nDesign of the Glider "Kegel-Kassel"\n3) The Kegel-Kassel, a parasol glider also with overhanging\nwings and a narrow, well streamlined and carefully constructed\nfuselage (figure 305).\n4) The "Wien", a glider with strongly braced, two-part wings\n(figure 306), a fuselage having an elliptical cross section, an\naerodynamic efficiency of at least 20, and a sinking speed of only\n60 cm/sec.

It has also tried to\ninvestigate new forms and, in particular, to develop vehicles based\non the shape of certain birds with very small tails. It has thus\nintroduced two types of tailless aircraft; the "Storch" (Stork) and\nthe "Ente" (Duck), constructed in its workshops.\n\nFigure 312\nDesign of the Glider "Storch"\n\nThe first is a kind of parasol monoplane with wings pointing\nrearward, as can be seen in certain Lairds during rapid gliding\nflight. The wings are maintained in position by two masts forming\na V. Below the wingtips, two semicircular\nvertical planes accomplishinq the tasks of\ndirectional rudders were fixed at first.\nNehring was the first to try out this\ntailless aircraft. He noticed that the\ndihedral formed by the wings caused too\ngreat a directional stability and that the\napparatus flew constantly in a straight\nline when the rudders were released.\nThe longitudinal stability was good,\nexcept when the pilot worked the ailerons\nexcessively. In contrast, turning performance was mediocre.\n\nFigure 313\nThe Glider "Storch"\nin Flight\n\nTo correct these problems, the wing\ndihedral was eliminated and the vertical\nrudders were placed above the wings (figure\n312). The result was that turns were\neasier to execute if the vertical rudders\nwere operated extensively and the ailerons\nonly slightly. Furthermore, exiting from a\nturn was very easy thanks to the way the\nvertical rudders worked. In contrast, during\ninclement weather, the aircraft displayed a\ncertain instability.\n\nAfter many trials, the "Stork" was equipped with a 500 cm3,\n8 hp motorcycle engine, which was placed behind the short fuselage\n(figure 313) and directly drove a propellor.\n\n280\n\n200\n\nThe wingspan of the motorized vehicle was 12.1 meters and its\nwing area was lS jc,2 . Its total flight weight was 250 kg. The\n"Stork` carried a load of 14 kg/m2 and, despite its small motor,\ncould fly at 127 km/h. Since it had neither wheels nor skids, it\nhad to be launched with a shock cord catapult. The authors claimed\nthat its aerodynamic efficiency was about 20.\nTests made on this tailless machine showed that it had a high\nlevel of 6tab 4 lity that was not affected by even very turbulent\nbanking and sideslips were performed exactly as in a\nair.\t\nnormal airplane. After the tests, the Germans stated that such a\nflat spin. A pilot had\nvehicle exhibits no loss of speed\nasked to pull forcefully on the joystick and to\napparently been\nmake the airplane rear up. The craft remained in this position\nwithout spinning. Similarly, if the pilot brought the stick all\nthe way back towards him, the vehicle continued to respond to all\nmovement of the rudders without any tendency to spin.\n\nit\n\nThe second vehicle, the "Ente", is, as a whole, duck shaped.\nThe central part of the body, which supports the wings, is preceded\nas in the animal by a sort of neck at the end of which is a small\nhorizontal plane. (See figure 314.)\n\nezzt\nFigure 314\nDrawings of the Glider "Ente"\nPiloting such a tailless aircraft is very easy as a result of\nthe fact that it is possible to let go of the controls both at takeoff and in flight, thanks to the "Duck\'s" remarkable stability.\nThe vertical rudders are placed on the wing tips, as in the\n"Stork". They are very efficient since it is possible to go into\na turn with a single rudder without using the ailerons. The aircraft exits from a turn just as easily through the use of the\nopposite rudder. In contrast,the "Ente" performs poorly in cross\nwinds, especially when banking. In these circumstances, it sometimes\neven makes a sudden U-turn and ends up going in a direction opposite\nto the route desired by the pilot. It has another drawback when\nlanding.

Here, albat*\nrosses maneuver, ascend, and descend with their wings motionless\nthrough the use of horizontal winds of varying speed, inclination,\nand orientation.\nWe have seen that humans : have succeeded in imitating the first\ntwo groups of birds. We now snow how to remain suspended in the\nair above cliffs or slopes for 14 hours while covering distances\nof 150 km at more than 3,000 meters of altitude. To do this we use\nthe updrafts occurring in front of squall lines and below cumulus\nclouds.\n\nAs far as the albatrosses\' method of soaring goes, the achievements up to now have been very meager. This is probably because\nwe know neither what to make use of in a horizontal wind nor how\nto maneuver to take advantage of the wind\'s internal energy.\nStarting in 1906 and excepting the , war years, I have been\nparticularly preoccupied with this problem.\nI. The Magnan Flexible Wing Aircraft\n\nI, based my work on the observations that I had already made of\nbirds and especially on the experiments that had demonstrated for\nme the great advantage of flexible wings. In 1922, I built a\nsoaring aircraft, as I had done in 1914 (figure 315), with the\nfeatures of such palriipeds as the gannet. The aircraft was consequently a monoplane with thick, long, narrow wings whose profile, curvature, and angle of incidence varied like those of birds, and they\nresponded elastically to forces deforming them in a singular manner.\n\nj\t\n{\t\n^\t\ni\t\n\nFigure 315\nThe Magnan Glidnr with Flexible, High Aspect Ratio Wings (1914)\nThe study I made of avian wing configuration during soaring \t\nled me to consider two different wing designs. The first type\n\n/203\n\n283\n\nhad outstretched wings whose straight leading edges formed a\ncontinuous line. The other had flexed wings pointed rearward.\nAs we have seen, the effects of gusts on wings increases as the\nwings are spread out, I therefore preferred not to use the second\narrangement for the first tests. I also chose a moderate aspect\nratio since the handling of high aspect ratio aircraft is more\ndifficult in the beginning.\nLastly, I planned at the; time that my aircraft would have an\nelevated weight. Until then, it was thought that soaring was\npossible only wit\'b, a vehicle of low sinking ,speed and that the only\nway to achieve this was to reduce the load" on the airfoils. This\nled to the construction of lightweight aircraft. For soaring in\nhorizontal winds, however, heavy aircraft capable of supporting\nlarge stresses are needed. The large mass of heavyweight aircraft\nkeeps them stable in gusts, just like marine palmipeds.\nWing Construction Methods\n\nEach of the vehicle\'s wings contained a spar attached to the\nbody of the aircraft at a point 60 cm from an elbow it possessed.\nThe spars ended in two wood boards, one attached to the upper and\none to the lower surface. The boards gave the wing tips a certain\nelasticity.\nFurthermore, the spars diminished in thickness and width as\nthey approached the wing tips. At the elbow, they were 214 mm\nwide by 144 mm high, whereas at the wing tip, they were only 120 mm\nwide by 50 mm thick.\nThe wing spars supported flexible ribs. Each rib was made of\na sheet of ash going around the spar. The end of the upper sheet\nwas attached to the lower sheet in the posterior third of the wing.\nIt was fixed tothe wing spar by two special fasteners. (See\nfigure 316.)\nThe upper sheet of the rib supported two cross-braces linking\nit to a bearing housing by means of two interposed sleeves.\nSall bearings were lodged in the housing, which kept them\nin contact witha ball race on the wing spar.\nAs a result of this setup, the upper sheet could not become\nseparated from the wing spar. It could, however, slide forward\nand backward without effort. It thus accommodated the deformation\nof the wing ribs by the wind and gravity.\nLastly, three sheets of ash formed the wing rib\'s lower surface. They were arranged like leaf springs so as to limit flexing\nand bring the supple plates back to their exact resting position in\nthe absence of outside forces.\nNumerous tests were carried out and twelve different rib patterns were built. This was done to assure that the ribs, and there- /204\nfore the wings, had the capacity to automatically adjust their\n284\n\nattack angle, through.their elastic response to tie action of the\nload and the wind, without exceeding a certain maximum flexing.\nEach type of main rib was submitted to increasing loads., The\nsheets were mounted on a thick wood board forming a spar. The\nboard was in turn attached to a rigid support in a static test.\nposition. This held the rib at the planned attack angle.\nLoads distributed in a suitable fashion were placed on the\nflexible part, i.e. betweenthe spar and the trailing edge. The\ndoubly curved deformation that seemed the best was thus obtained.\nThen, the loads were increased until a deformation that would\nendanger the proper functioning of the aircraft resulted.\n\nua\n\no2 0.5\n\n0\n\n0.7\n\nI\n\nI\t\n\nj\t\n\nw\n\nFigure 316\t\nRib with Ball Race in M2\t\nFlexible Wing Glider\t\n\nFigure 317\nThe Deformation of a Rib\nBecause of Unequally\nDistributed Loads\n\nThe first type adopted as preferable possessed a ball race.\nThe lower surface was made of three leaf springs, while the upper\npart was itself reinforced with another sheet. In these circumstances, the rib began to assume an undesirable form only after\na 6 kg load was distributed decrementally from the vicinity of the\nwing spar to the end of the rib (figure 317) . An ideal curvature was\nmaintained up to 4 kg.\nLastly, I should point out that the part of the rib corresponding to the wing\'s forward edge moved forward 4 cm when deformed in\nthe type of test considered here. The amount was smaller in ribs\nbuilt for the aircraft.\nThe various elastic ribs were distributed on the wing in the\nfollowing manner. There was first a series of 25 ribs in close\nproximity to one another. Their structure was similar to the\n\n285\n\n. dvm .... .. \t :.....:._..._.. \t x ,.. .ems._. ,..,\t\n\n......\t\n\n_ .\t .e......._....4_\t ..__.\t\n\n-. \t\n\n.\n\nstandard rib, but they differed in thickness. The thickest were\nclose to the body and had a vertical height of .195 meters whereas\nthe thinnest ones were .080 meters high. The ribs were arranged so\nthat the distance from the leading edge to the middle of the wing\nspar was everywhere equal to 24 cm.\n\nFigure 318\nThickness, Camber, and Incidence of\nSome of the M2 Glider wing Ribs\nIn addition, the radius of curvature increased uniformly from\nthe aircraft\'s body to its wing tips. The wing ribs were also\nplaced so as to differ in angle of incidence, with the largest angle\nclosest to the fuselage (figure 318).\nAt the wing spar\'s elbow, the rib camber was 180 mm and the\nangle of incidence was 23 0 . The camber was 150 mm and the angle\nof incidence 15\xc2\xb0 at the middle of the wing.\nThe wing finally ended in a series of eleven ribs made up \t\nsimply of two wooden sheets attached to the upper and lower sides\n\nof the wing spar, with the upper one connected to the lower one\nalong the posterior- third of the wing. The ribs formed a fanshaped4 structure. This gave a pointed form to the wing tip and\nexactly copied a sea bird\'s wing.\nLastly, a few ribs were fixed to one of the thin wooden plates\nterminating the wing spar.\nThe curvature as well as the angle of incidence in the end\nsection were small. In fact,the camber was only 55 mm and the\nangle of incidence 01 in the outside third of the wing.\n\n286\n\n/205\n\nThe\n\nwing\'s leading\n\nedge was composed of a series of thin,\n\nflexible layers of special, jointed plywood. They followed the\nanterior profile of the ribs and were connected to their flexible\nsheets.\nThe winds were covered with fabric attached to each rib and\nsealed in front to the leading edge in a manner that allowed the\ncloth to respond to the changes in wing shape without puckering up.\n\nThe method of constructing wings described above has numerous\nadvantages. First. the ribs easily change shape under the action\nof gravity and the wind. This movement is compensated for by the\nball bearings.\n\nFurthermore, the airflow makes the rear part of the ribs vibrate,\nwhich helps provide lift to the\nI had thus obtained an\neasily deformable wing which changed shape and vibrated in response\nto gravity and the wind. It was consequently a wing of variable\ncurvature and angle of incidence.\n\naircraft.\n\nIn addition, the wing tips were made very flexible by the thin\nwood plates, like the wings of birds, thanks to the upper rib\nsheets, which could slide freely over the wing spar.\nThe two wings thus constituted were linked by their spars at a\npoint a little in front of the center of the aircraft\'s body. The\nangle between them was about 170*. The posterior part of each wing\nwas completely detached from the fuselage and could bend freely.\nThe-two wings, which work under compression, were joined by a horizontal pylon laid flat against the fuselage and attached at the\nelbow of each wing.\nFinally, the fact that the two wings were attached at approximately the middle of the aircraft\'s body allowed the center of\ngravity to be placed in a plane perpendicular to the longitudinal\naxis of the aircraft and intersecting the wing spars. In addition,\nthe center of gravity is located below the wings as a result of\ntheir v-shaped configuration and their point of attachment with the\nfuselage. This is advantageous for balancing the craft and particularly in maneuvering while soaring.\nIn a static test, the wings supported a load of 5 without\nrupture or permanent deformation.\nFuselage and Controls\n\nThe aircraft\'s body was madesof wooden frame members alternately\nthe other relative to the vehicle\'s\njoined in pairs at their base and at\ntheir summit so as to form a series of juxtaposed V\'s. They also\nsupported four longerons and longitudinal lathes constituting a\nbase for applying the fusels+ ;e\'s fabric covering.\n\ninclined in one direction or\nlongitudinal axis. They were\n\n287\n\nThe two middle frame members were attached tothe wing pylon\nand held transverse members on which the wing spars were fixed.\nTheir lower sections were linked to a part containing the landing\nwheel axle.: The master midframe member was located here. It was\n90 cm high and 80 cm wide.\nThe two middle frame members also leave an empty area where\nthe aviator can be seated in a position where he can see the airfoils and the surrounding environment.\n\n./206.\n\nThe aircraft\'s tail included a vertical fin and a directional\nrudder that t2rned about a vertical axis, a .5 m2 horizontal plane\nand an .810 m elevator rudder turning about a horizontal axis.\nThis assembly was supported by a very light duraluminum beam\nattached to the body of the aircraft.\nBanking the ,rings- is, by a ll evidence, very useful in maintaining\nthe lateral governability of a soaring airy graft. It should- be\n\nallowed for when planning the aircraft, as\nsudden strong gusts. However, the problem\nto resolve in the case of flexible wings.\nable to find a satisfactory solution after\n\nan immediate reaction to\nof banking is difficult\nIn spite of this, I was\nnumerous tests.\n\nAmong the various aircraft controls, first of all, was the\njoystick, which controlled altitude and banking and was contained\nin its well-known socket. The stick was connected through a jointed\nshaft to the pilot\'s seat. The seat rested by means of four rollers\non two rails mounted on the aircraft\'s body and parallel to its\nlongitudinal axis.\nThere was a jointed connection between the joystick and a\nlongitudinal tube parallel to the axis of the aircraft. The tube,\nwhich slid through several guides, supported a Lever controlling\nwing banking. A control cable wAs attached to the lever. It\npassed through several guide pulleys and was attached to a king pin\nfixed to a flap extending from the ribs at the wing\'s end.\nThe longitudinal tube joined to the joystick was also connected\nto the horizontal rudder. The tube\'s rear- end was square and fit\ninto an opening in the rudder\'s strut assembly.\nDirectional control was established by means of a swing bar.\nThe landing gear included two wheels mounted on a duraluminum\naxle, which was streamlined at the section exposed to the wind.\nIt extended only 15 cm over the sides of the fuselage.\nThe axle rested on the reinforced v-shaped connection formed\nby the two central frame members. It was attached by means of a\nset of elastic cords that dampened the shocks due to landing.\n\n288\n\n/207\n\nr\n\n^\xe2\x80\xa2i.\t\n\nr ^ .r^^^ i I ^ \t\n\n^ ( ^ r+ i\'^\t\n\n^\t\n\nf\t\n\n:fry 1t\n\nI\'\t\n\n,r\t\n\nft\n\ns\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2,^^ ,, ^ ^\t\n\n\'\n\n,,:\t\n\n. ii\'\t\n\nr\t\nr^ I^ ; 1\'\xe2\x80\xa2^ 77\n;\\\t\n1\n\nr\n\n\'7f\n\n. \xe2\x96\xba\'^\n\nh. y N..J. .w31at\n\nt\xe2\x80\xa2 r\nf\n\nl.a....a..c.,^\xe2\x80\xa2:\n\n1\t\n111\t\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 ^`^^ ^^^wv`^\xe2\x96\xba\t\n\nF^\n\xe2\x80\xa2 ^ ^ ` 1^^,\n\nJ\n\nFigure 319\n,Maynarn M2 Flexible Wing Aircraft, Uncovered\n\n^\t\n\n1\t\n\nI\n\n:\\\t\n\n,\t\n\n_\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2,\t\n\n.`^+.^^\xe2\x80\x94\t\n\nt.\n\n-fir\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nr\n\n\'^- r \'. . - ^^ _ r \t\n\n,^^..v^ ,.\n\n^\t\n\nCIF,.\t\n\nf\\.\t\n\n^^++\n\n_.^\t\n\n^, ^.^^\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2^; ^"^\'.^:.\t\n\n/\t\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\'tea ,t,, \xe2\x80\xa2\n\n^r\nI^\n\nFigure 320\nMagnan M2 Fle;clble Wing Aircraft, Viewed from the Side\nSpecifications of the M2 Aircraft\nHere are some of the general specifications of the 1922 glider:\nFlight Weight\t\nEmpty Weight\t\nTotal Wingspan\t\n\n200 kg\n130 kg\n4.50 m\n\nMidwing Depth \t\n\n1.30 m\t\n\n.d,\n\nE,A!\'E\n\nt;\n\nNr \xe2\x80\xa2 t\' QT.ALPP\n\n289\n\nTotal Length\nWing Area\nLoad per m 2\nWing Weight\nWing Weight per m 2\nTotal Height\nHeight of Fuselage\n\n4.95\n10.5\n10\n60\n5.5\n1.76\n1.10\n\nin\nm2\nkg\nkg\nkq\nm\nm\n\nCt\n\t\n14PA\n\n{\n\nLAM\nFigure 321\nMagnan M2 Flexible Wing Aircraft Viewed from the Top\nThe photographs in figures 319 to 322 perfectly illustrate\nthese specifications and the construction of the aircraft, both\nwith and without its fabric covering.\nThe finished aircraft was suspended to determine its center of\ngravity and to find out if it was as well placed as planned, Its\nposition was supposed to be a little in front of the anterior third\nof the wings. Experiments showed that it was indeed even with the\nwing spars. It was determined with precision, moreover. When empty,\nthe aircraft\'s center of gravity was found to be 16 cm behind the\nmiddle of the wing spar, i.e., 40 cm from the leading edge and\ntherefore at the 30/100 point on the wing. When ready to fly, i.e.\nwith the pilot in his seat locked in its middle position, the center\nof gravity was located 7 cm behind the middle of the spar, or 31 cm\nfrom the leading edge. It was therefore at the 23/100 point on the\nwing. In these circumstances, the pilot, by moving his seat forward\nor backward, could cause the vehicle to tip irLmodiately to the front\nor rear.\nTests of the M2\nThe first tests I performed before the war had already indicated\nthat the effect of a gust was to make a gliding aircraft gain height.\nWith the aid of the gantry crane arrangement about which I will\ntalk in detail further on, it was possible to determine the maximum\n\n290\n\naerodynamic efficiency of My flexible wing aircraft. Based on the\nexperiments that have been carried out, the efficiency appeared to\nbe approximately 15.\n\nFigure 322\n\nPlans for the M2 Flexible Wing Aircraft\nThe first experiments performed at Saint-Inglevert also\nallowed me to establish some of the principles of soaring by means\nof gusts. This was despite the difficulties that had to be surmounted during such tests. First of all, like the original aviators,\nI had to resolve the one basic problem impeding the start of experimentation. This is to insure that adequate lift was supplied in a\ngiven wind.\nThe vehicle was piloted in the test flights by Lt_. Canivet, who\nhad a considerable knack for applying the flight maneuvers of soaring birds. The following findings resulted;\n1) The marine type of soaring aircraft, carrying a heavy load\nper square meter, never took off when facing the wind on level ground\nin the absence of any rising current, and pulled by an lA mm shock\ncord stretched 100%. It rolled but it did not leave the ground\nwhen tiere was no wind.\n\n291\n\n66 1 . ,\n\n200\n\n2) When the average speed of the wind reached 6 m/sec, if the\t\napparatus was placed in the same circumstances, i.e. on level\n\nground and facing the wind, rolled along the ground for ten meters\nor so and then climbed into the air and glided. The flight was of\n6ing on the circumstances. It was even possible\nvariably, length, depei,,\nfor Lt. Cani.vet, by moving the horizontal rudder in an appropriate\nfashion, to gain height in midflight at the moment a gust passed\nover.\n3) In a wind of 1.2 m /sec, the aircraft took off almost immediately,\neven whenthe shock cord was stretched only 50%.\nA study of the question will allow these results to be understood.\nTo launch the aircraft and give it a propitious speed, I used\na system of pulley blocks, releases, and shock cords. The last of\nthese was composed of two strands 18 mm in diameter and 20 meters\nlong.\nI wanted first of all to find the pulling force exerted on the\nvehicle by the launch system. For this purpose,the shock cords\nwere attached to a precalibrated stress ring dynamometer. We\nnoted that the needle on the dial moved to the higher division for\na load of 8 kg.\nThe figures contained in the following table were thus\nobtained:\nDeformation\nof dynamometer Sing\n\t\n(K 10\' MM)\n\nRelative\nStrain\n\nL - LO\nLo\nl11\n\n,\t\n\nLoad\n(kg)\n\n13\n\n111r\n\n12\n\n17.110\n\n1\n7.4\n\n\'\t\n\nlit\n\n:1141\n\nTest flights were then attempted in calm weather. The shock \t\ncords were attached to the hook on the aircraft and were stretched\nby a factor of 7/8, so that the length of the strands increased\nfrom 20 meters to 37.5 meters. Each strand was pulled by a force\nof 160 kg, or a total of 320 kg. Every time it was released, the\nvehicle rolled over the ground for a distance of 20 to 30 meters,\nbut it never took off under these conditions.\nStudy of Vehicle Takeoff\nBy using the data coming from the experiments, I sought to\nlearn if the work furnist.ed by releasing the shock cords was enough\n\n292\n\n/209\n\nto launch the vehicle.\nThe amount of work is: 320 x 17.5 = 2,800 kg-m.\nThe aircraft traveled 25 meters while the shock cords were\nbeing released. If one assumes that ground friction was only 20 kg,\n\nthe work absorbed is then 25 x 20 = 500 kg-m.\n\nTherefore, the amount available for launching was: 2,800 500 = 2,300 kg-m. This enabled the vehicle to reach a maximum velocity, neglgcting air resistance, determined by the equation:\n1 x 200 x V\t\n21300 kg-m, or V= 15 m/sec.\n1 ".1\nThe study made with the crane of different aerodynamic efficiencies in the glider indicated that at departure the aircraft had a\nCx of about 0.2 and a C Z of aroun\xc2\xbb 1.5 1 as had already been supposed.\n\nAt a speed of 15 m/sec, the resistance is found to be 30 kg.\nSince air resistance increases in proportion to the square of\nthe speed, the work that it absorbs during a 25 meter long launching\ncan be evaluated in an approximate manner. it is found to be\n225 kg -m. Out of the 2,300 kg-m, there thus remains 2 1 015 kg-m\navailable. These 2,075 kg-m give the aircraft a speed of 1%ss than\n15 m/see. The exact speed is determined by the equation MV /2 = W,\nand by replacing 2,300 with 2 1 075, one obtains V - 14.3 m/sec, At\nthis speed Cx equals 27 kg and C Z equals 204 kg.\nWe have thus arrived at a figure that is just equal to the\naircraft\'s weight, which is aT=t 200 kg when in working order. The\nspeed attained in these conditions is only enough to make the\nvehicle take off in calm air if the efficiency of the shock cords was\nequal to 1 and if there were no friction between the ground and the\nglider. Now, a test made with the apparatus I used to determine the\nspeed and excess power capacity of birds in flight showed that the\naircraft\'s rolling speed was obviously less than 15 m/sec and was in\nthe neighborhood of 12 m/sec. That explained why the vehicle never\ntook off in the absence of wind.\nIn contrast, a head wind of a few meters per second was\nenough to cause takeoff, since the supplementary work needed to\novercome the increased resistance was small and the :ihock cords\ninduced approximately the same ground speed. \t\n\n/210\n\nFor example, in a head wind of 3 m/sec, the calculated speed, 14.3\n\nm/sec, increases to 17.3 m/sec. Resistance becomes 34 kg, while thrust\ngoes up to 270 kg. One can see why, in the tests that took place, the\naircraft was able to take off in a 6 m/sec wind after rolling on the\nground for a few meters and that in a 12 m/sec wind it took off\nimmediately, even though the shock cords were only stretched 50%.\nThe M3 and M4 Aircraft\n\nIn 1925, I built a third high aspect ratio, flexible wing aircraft, which was closer to the form of an albatross. This was the\n293\n\nM3 (figure 323). In addition, a built a fourth one, the M4 (figure\n\n324), with m-shaped wings.\n\nFigure 323\nDesign of the Flexible Wing M3 Glider\n\nFigure 324\nDesign of the M-Wing M4 Glider\n\n294\n\n_\t\n\n-\n\nHere are the specifications of the two vehicles.\nFlight Weight\nEmpty Weight\nTotal Wingspan\nMidwing Depth\nTotal Length\nWing Area\nLoad per m 2\nWing Weight\nNet Fuselage Height\nAerodynamic Efficiency\nHorizontal Speed\nSinking Speed\nAspect Ratio\n\nM3\n200 kg\n130 kg\n17 m\n1 m\n6 m\n16 m2\n12.5 kg\n70 kg\n1.10 m\n20\n15 m/sec\n0.75 m/sec\n17\n\nM4\n200 kg\n130 kg\n10 in\n1.30 m\n6 m\n\n12\n16.6\n76\n1.10\n20\n15\n0.75\n17\n\nm2\nkg\nkg\nm\nm/sec\nm/sec\n/211\n\nIt is interesting that by 1925 I had already created a high\naspect ratio glider with fully overhanging wings. The German sailplanes closely resercble this vehicle. I should add that we lacked\nthe means to test it out completely.\nII. The Factors in Horizontal Winds Supporting Soaring\nIndeed, for tests of the kind I pursue, the difficulty is not\nto have the means, but also to know the exact features of horizontal winds enabling an aircraft to remain airborne and move forward\nwithout a motor.\nonly\n\nShould one favor certain factors more than others? Should one\nmaneuver in gusts using the variations in inclination or orientation,\nor rather employ the variations of speed with increasing altitude?\nThe Wind\'s Vertical Oscillations\n\nIn 1912, Betz, in a theory also supported by Knoller and based\non Lilienthal\'s observations, had already stated the opinion that the\ncause of soaring resided only in the birds\' use of the vertical\noscillations of the wind. He then investigated the effect of an air\ncurrent on an airplane wing.\nHe found that the arithmetic average of the various values of\nresistance could be negative, i.e. produce propulsion. In the model\nunder examination, the apparent resistance was cancelled out by\nvertical wind oscillations ranging from +10 0 to - 10 0 . A negative\napparent resistance, i.e. a propulsion, was obtained with oscillations\nto greater amplitude. According to the author, if a lift equal\nfo eight times resistance is assumed, supporting and propulsive forces\nbecome possible in winds whose oscillations deviate from the average\ndirection by 16\xc2\xb0 in each direction.\n\n295\n\nBertelli claimed in 1902 that in\na small wind tunnel a surface could be\nsucked.up by the air current striking\nit. In addition, Lilienthal found\nthat a hollow wing suspended in a\nnatural wind felt a slight pull forward.\n\na) The Katzmayr Bf fect\nInspired by the previous research,\nKatzmayr embarked on new wind tunnel\nexperiments to support this theory,\nwithout try i ng to obtain supportive\n\nevidence from nature.\n\nHe placed wing mockups in a wind\ntunnel whose wind was made to oscillate\nby a system of slotted shutters capable\nof producing now a rising current and\nnow a descending one. This experiment\nenabled Katzmayr to observe that the\nmodel wing no longer resisted\nmoving forward, but actually was\npropelled and had a tendency to ad\nvance against the wind.\nThe author made the\nwind tunnel tests:\n\nfollowing\n\nFigure 325\nKatzmayr\'s Mechanical\nShutters for Making\na Wind Oscillate\n\nThe wing under study was fixed in position. In contrast, by\t\n/212\noperating a system of plates arranged like slotted shutters installed\nat the exit of the wind tunnel exhaust, periodic variations in\nvertical direction were induced in the air current. (See figure\n325.)\n\nKatzmayr pointed out that by using four parallel plates to\nwhich he gave oscillatory amplitudes of 0,9,,,12, 15, 18, 21 and 240\nthe direction of the air current underwent synchronous variations\nof 0, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10.5, and 12 0 . He noticed that the polar curve\nof the wigs being tested was clearly improved. He even observed\nnegative resistances for two of the wings. The influence of the\nnumber of oscillations seemed secondary and the phenomenon was produced in an air current changing direction 30 times a minute.\nAll this means that in these conditions the wing is affected\nnot by a resistance that impedes it, but by a horizontal force\ndirected into the wind that makes it move forward in that direction.\nRateau formulated the equation describing the principal laws\nof what is called the Katzmayr effect in our country and the Betz\neffect in Germany. This equation clearly :establishes the influence\nof an oscillating air current.\n\n296\n\nFigure 322\nSchematic Drawing of the Ve,.":ical Oscillations\nMarignane\nin a Wind Recorded\t\nb) The Influence of Vertical Oscillations on a Glider\nRecordings of the instantaneous variations in wind inclination\ncan help us gain a knowledge of the effect of these variations on\nthe resistance to the forward motion of a bird, glider, or airplane.\nLet us take the recording whose larger variations in inclination are roughly reproduced in figure 326. Three oscillatory\nsystems are visible. One of them has a large undulation lasting\naround 6 seconds and whose amplitude is about 10 0 . The second\nsystem lasts an average of 2 seconds and displays an average amplitude of 13\xc2\xb0. The third one lasts 0.6 seconds and has an average\ntotal amplitude of 150.\nAlong with Huguenard and Planiol, I tried to calculate the\nKatzinayr effect resulting from the action of the oscillations on\nan airplane crossing through these disturbances without its own\ninclination relative to the ground being altered. We also had to\ntake account of the fact that the smallest disturbances considered\nhere have a length of 7 meters. We neglected the smaller oscillations appearing on the reel of film. Their length is on the order\nof a meter and they could consequently only have an effect on birds\nand insects.\nWe chose as a standard for study an airplane whose load per\nsquare meter was about 52 kg and whose speed was about 40 m/sec.\nIt was equipped with Gottingen 430 wings, which have a Cz of\n0.55 and a C of 0.026. Let us assume that the total drag is\ntwice that of the wing, i.e. C X = 0.052. The airplane\'s drag and\nlift, for an angle of incidence i of the wing to the wind, is\nrepresented by these equations:\nCX = 0.052 + 0.325 i + 1.24 i 2 in radians,\nCz = 0.59 + 3.9 i in radians.\n/213\n\nA. Rateau\'s calculation indicates that the Katzmayr effect\t\nproduces a reduction in resistance equal to (al - b 2 )j /2, where\nj is the maximum inclination of the wind relative to a horizontal\nline, and a sinusoidal wind, which is similar to the wind studied\n\ny\n297\n\nhere, is assumed. This equation is independent of the oscillatory\nfrequency.\nThe three systems of pulsations into which we have split the\nrecorded wind have oscillatory amplitudes of respectively 10, 13,\nand 15 0 , which will be increased by the effect of the airplane.\nThe inclination above the horizon is repectivel 5, 6.5, and 7.5\xc2\xb0.\nThe average j2 is therefore equal to: (5 2 + 6.5^ + 7.5 2 )/57 2 or\n123/3,250 = 0.038.\n\nThe term a11 b2 in Rateau\'s equation above has the value\n3.9 - 1.24 = 2.56.\n\nThe reduction of Cx is therefore 1/2 x 2.66 x 0.039= 0.051.\nAs you can see, in these circumstances and with a wing inferior\nfrom the point of view of the Katzmayr effect tothe one indicated\nby the author, the atmospheric disturbances under examination suffice\nto propel the aircraft.\nThis can be connected to the apparent increase in the lift of\na wing near the ground. It can be taken for granted that a turbulent\nflow diminishes the apparent resistance to forward motion. The\nairplane can then fly at a larger angle without drag being greater\nthan in calm air.\nNow let \'us examine the situation of a narrow wing glider with\nan aerodynamic efficiency of 15, like the me we just considered.\nC? can be taken to be 0.03 when the aircraft flies in these conditions, and certainly the glider is propelled all by itself in such\na wind.\nTake now an albatross weighing 10 kg and flying at a speed of\n20 m/sec with.a load of 13 kg/m2 . Let us suppose that the wings\nhave an average contour- equivalent to the preceding aircraft. However, it is obvious from our observations that the bird\'s total\nefficiency should be greater than 10 and that in place of the coefficient 0.052 that we used for the aircraft, one could use a\ncoefficient smaller than 0.03. The eficiency in these circumstances\nwould go up to about 20. The propulsive and lif\nting forces would\nthus be assured, even in weaker disturbances than those we have witnessed. Considering only the small., rapid oscillations in the wind,\nwhich extend over an air mass 7 meters long, Cx would be reduced\nby approximately half. This is enough to ensure the flight of a\n\nbird with an efficiency of 20.\n\nHitherto, we have assumed that the bird, like the airplane,\ndoes not maneuver. One would think, however,that opportune changes\nin the angle of incidence would improve the flight conditions even\nmore. On the other hand, the regions of the world and the winds\nnear the water through which albatrosses fly certainly are as\nagitated as the location where the film in figure 326 was recorded.\nThe variations of wind inclination could thus suffice in itself,\nlike the variations evoked in other theories, to explain how this\nbird flies. Some solid experimentation would confirm that this is\nindeed the case.\n298\n\n/214\n\nHowever, it is proper to say at this time that by the time\none reaches 10 meters above the sea, the variations in inclination rarely average greater than P, which would cause the reduction of C to be less than 0.004.\nIn these circumstances, the airplane mentioned above would\nhave its resistance recuced by only 1/12, which is negligible,\nand the glider by 1/8.\nIn contrast, the albatross\'s resistance would be reduced by\nabout 1/4.\nVariations in the Wind\'s Orientation\n\nIt might also be possible to use variations in the wind\'s\norientation.\nPainlevd considered the question just as See did:\n"Let us imagine a horizontal north-south wind that,\nhowever, alternately inclines a little to the east or west\nevery ten seconds. A bird.who starts out with a substantial\nsouth-north speed can fly indefinitely against the wind, i.e.\nfrom the south to the north, without making another wingbeat. This is the paradox in its most striking form.\n"Let us represent the bird, who we are likening to a\nmodel glider, in a horizontal plane with its head northward\nand its tail southward. It constantly maintains the axis\nwind blows a\nof its body in this direction, but when\nlittle to the west, the bird maneuvers about its axis to\nlean slightly to its right. When the wind blows from the\neast, it Leans slightly to the left. Air resistance is always\ndirected upward and perpendicular to the bird\'s plane, and\ntherefore to its axis and the horizontal south-north direction. It alternately leans slightly to the left or the right,\nand it chooses its inclination so that the vertical component\nof resistance equals its weight. fin these circumstances,\nthe bird retains its horizontal south-north speed, but it\nfestoons to the right and left in a barely perceptible fashion.\nIt thus moves forward against the wind indefinitely by means\nof this simply rocking. What is more, if, at the same time\nthat it: leans slightly to the side, the bird tips very slightly forward, the air resistance, at the same time as it has\na small, lateral component constantly changing direction, will\nhave a very small south-north component. This last component\nwill always point in the same direction and pushes the bird\nforward increasing its speed against the wind. The bird\ntherefore flies against the wind with a growing speed, without flapping its wings, without any other effort than the\nsmall maneuver causing its body to lean alternately to the\nleft and right."\n\nthe\n\n299\n\nThis description is recognizably similar in every point to\nthe explanation of how a.boat tacks against a wind with the aid of\nits sail and its keel, which keeps it on course. The resulting\ntrajectory caused by the series of tacks twists slightly around\nthe average line it is following.\nVariations in Wind Speed\nWe are now going to see that soaring in horizontal winds\ncan very well be explained by the simple use of speed variations\nin the air current and, in particular, by gusts. We will find\nthat the way in which birds maneuver in these gusts is easy to\nunderstand.\nLet us take as an example a marine wind of 15 m/sec exhibiting\nspeed variations of 5 m/sec in one direction or another, which\noccurs once in a while during storms in the Atlantic. Let us also\ngo back to the case of the flexible wing aircraft weighing 200 kg\nin flying condition and whose horizontal speed is around 15 m/sec,\nwith a sinking speed of l m/sec in still air. Let us launch it\t\nagainst the wind while it is blowing at an average rate of 15 m/sec.\nAs we have seen, the glider will sink vertically at 1 m/sec, its\nspeed relative to the ground being zero.\na) The Influence of Speed Variations on a Glider\nIf a gust suddenly arrives that makes the wind speed go from\n15 to 20 m/sec, the glider\'s horizontal speed, which was 15 m/sec\nrelative to the air, will abruptly gotp to 20 m/sec, Before the\nincrease in speed, the lifting forces balanced the aircraft\'s\nweight, 200 kg. As we know, lift is proportional to the square\nof the air current\'s speed. It is therefore abruptly increased\nfrom 15 x 15 = 225 to 20 x 20-= 400, whereas the vehicle\'s weight\nremains unaltered. The glider thus finds itself with an excess\nof lift and rapidly gains altitude as it little by little loses\nits horizontal speed. It ends up by stopping at a certain point\nand then descending anew until it has reattained its normal sinking\nand horizontal speeds.\nIt is obvious that a reduction in wind speed will give\nthe opposite results.\nIn a tail wind, an increase in air current speed will have\nthe effect of augmenting the vehicle\'s horizontal speed and of\nmaking it lose altitude. on the other hand, a reduction in wind\nspeed in theory will lead to an elevation of the aircraft.\nVariations in speed are therefore capAl\njle, as we have just\nseen, of aiding a glider by increasing its lift. The same is true\nfor an albatross.\n\n300\n\n/215\n\nFor exar\xe2\x96\xbatple, sdppose that, the gar- jALval of a gust `hu4nients the wind\nspeed by 40% and that the bird does not maneuver in response. The\nbird will then receive during a supposedly very short instant an\nupward impulsion representing approximately twice its weight P\nand an impulsion tending to impede its flight proportional to 2P/n,\nwhere n is its aerodynamic efficiency at the time.\nIf, on the contrary, the bird reduces the attack angle of its\nwings so as to maintain its ,lifting force almost exactly, it will\nproduce a reduction in the resistance to its advance. Drag could\nbecome about four times smaller because the bird will have divided\nits wings\' incidence by approximately two.\nFinally, this maneuver, which increases its apparent efficiency, will have the effect of returning the animal\'s line of flight\nto the horizontal. If, besides, the wind takes on a slight ascendance at this moment,the line of flight could go up again above the\nhorizontal.\nLike the bird, the pilot-; also can gain height by maneuvering\nto make the best use of a gust\'s favorable effects.and struggling\nas required against the unfavorable ones. It is true that the pilot\nhas to display a very great adeptness and that the best thing for\nhim is simply to try to copy the birds. He therefore has to glide\ndownward when the wind weakens and to nose up slightly to rise back\nup when the wind increases in speed. In this way, he can move forward against the wind, although with a trajectory containing vertical\nundulations.\nb) Sainte-Lague\'s Calculations\n\nSainte-Lague, taking my aircraft as a standard, was able through\na special method of calculation to determine for every instant the\nvehicle\'s movement in a known wind. Here are some of the features\nof the trajectories he traced.\nThe trajectory in figure 327 corresponds to the case in which\nthe wind encountered by the aircraft is sinusoidal with extreme\nvalues of 10 and 15 m/sec and has , an oscillating acceleration rangging\nfrom -5 to +5 m/sec t . The initial relative speed is 20 m/sec and\nthe pilot engages in no maneuvers.\nAs you can see, the aircraft first rears and climbs close to\n15 meters by borrowing the wind\'s energy. It then goes into a dive\nand loses more height than it gained.\nFigure 328 depicts the trajectory followed.by the aircraft\nwhen gliding in a calm atmosphere. The pilot performs a downward\nglide without oscillations. The abscissa represents the distance\ntraveled in meters and the ordinate is the vehicle\'s altitude. The\ntime in seconds is marked on the trajectory itself. Under these\nconditions, the vehicle descends regularly and at the end of 100\nmeters is located 14 meters lower than before, after having flown at\n15 m/sec.\n\n3 O\n\n/216\n\nFigure 327\nTrajectory of M2 Glider in a\nGust whose Accelerations Range\nfrom -5 to +5 m/sect\n\nFigure 329\nChanges in the Preceding\nTrajectory Caused by a Six\nSecond Gust, without Maneuvers\nby the Pilot\n\nFigure 329 shows how the course changes under the influence of\ngust lasting G seconds, during which the wind grows from 0 to 5 m/sec\nin 3 seconds and then goes back to zero in an equal period of time.\nThe pilot executes no maneuvers during the flight. The vehicle, its\ncontrols locked, remains in its original state, under the conditions\nof the first trajectory. As you can see, at the end of 3 seconds\nand after traveling a little less than 40 meters, the aircraft is\nlocated approximately 5 meters higher than its point of departure.\n\na\n\nThe effect of the gust is to give the vehicle a speed of 18\nm/sec at the end of its dive. The aircraft then performs a series of\noscillations around its original gliding trajectory.\nFigure 330 depicts the trajectory that results when, in the\nsame gust, the pilot pushes on the joystick and reduces the wings"\nincidence by a few degrees after 1.5 seconds.\nThe aircraft, which had nosed up, goes into a dive. The pilot\nthen pulls the joystick back so that at the end of the gust, the\nvehicle takes on a direction, parallel to the simple gliding trajectory.\n\n302\n\nM\n\n3a\n\nFigure 330\nChanges in the Trajectory\nwhen Maneuvering in the\nSame Gust as Before\n\nFigure 331\nTrajectory of the M2 Glider\nin a Gust of Long Duration\n\nWhen this maneuver is executed,\n\nthe\n\naircraft is located\n\napproximately 2 meters above the latter trajectory. The gust\n\nhas thus made it gain 2 meters in altitude. It appears that in\nshorter and stronger gusts, it would be possible at the end of the\ngust to again take up the downward glide at a point higher than the\npoint of departure. A succession of such gusts would thus provide\nsupport indefinitely.\nFigure 331 shows the aircraft located at point 0 in the lower\npart of a glide with a speed of 20 m/sec. At this moment it encounters a Large, slow gust of constant acceleration equal to 2 m/sec2.\nThe pilot makes no maneuver in response and the vehicle rears up\nunder the combined effect of its excess speed and the wind\'s acceleration. It then climbs approximately 20 meters while covering a\nhorizontal distance of less than 40 meters, which takes it about 3\nseconds.\nAt this moment it has been slowed down considerably,\npoint that it stalls and abruptly goes into a dive.\n\nto the\n\nWhen it again assumes a horizontal position, it has retained\n10 meters of altitude and regained a speed of 3 m/sec relative to\nthe ground and 19 m/sec relative to the wind. The aircraft will\nthus rear up anew in such a wind.\nIt should be pointed out that the gust under consideration is\nnot entirely exceptional. In contrast, shorter gusts with higher\naccelerations are found in certain winds. This could be even more\npropitious for the aircraft.\n\nVariations in Speed with\n\nIncreasing Altitude\n\nFinally, Ps Lord Raleigh, Baines, and then Tdrac have indicated,\nsoaring in horizontal winds can also arise from the variations in\nair current with increasing altitude.\n\n303\n\n/217\n\nAtter.!ots with Flexible Wing Aircraft\n\nI limited myself to attempts to fly by means of gusts during\nthe tests carried out on my flexible wind aircraft. This is the\nsituation in which control is easiest.\nThe tests carried out at Saint - Inglevert, in the absence of any\nupdraft created by obstacles and even in slightly descending currents,\nconfirmed the first findings yielded by experiments. First of all,\nthe vehicles never took off in still air. In contrast, the passage\nof a gust made the vehicle gain height regularly. It is even possible\nto start ascending again in flight by maneuvering appropriately in\nthe succeeding gusts and thus providing further lift. r/.\n\n1\n1\n\naSn/\n\n1\t\n1\t\n\n1\ni\n\n!\n1\n\n^\t\n1\t\n\n1\n^\n\nj!\n\n$ Ms\n\n1\n/\t\n\n!\n\nJ2 $ ss of\nrs\' \xe2\x96\xba9s\n1\n10"\' 20\'" 30"\' 40" 50" 64\'"\t 70\'"\t 8 01\'\n\nFigure 332\nTrajectory Followed by an\nM2 Glider in a.Gusry Wind\nAveraging 6 m/sec\n\nKey: a) -Ground\n\nFigure 333\n\nRecording of Speed\nVariations of Wind\nBlowing during Tests\nd, Start of Flight\nf, End of Flight\n\nFigure 332 depicts the reconstruction of the trajectory followed by my flexible wing aircraft in a wind blowing from the west,\nand therefore from the sea, at an average speed of 6 m/sea.\nAn anemometer placed 10 meters in front and a little to the\nside of the aircraft before launching recorded the wind speed at\neach instant during the experiments. In figure 333, the beginning\nand the end of the .flight are marked off on the resulting graph.\nThe aircraft was launched into the wind by a shock cord cata-\n\npult at a speed of 12 m/sec. It to\'rh\',: off after rolling 9 meters\nand at this moment encountered the beginning of a gust whose\nspeed went from 1.5 meters to 8.5 meters in 2 seconds.\nThe vehicle immediately climbed to about 1\nground in a time of 1 second. Then, as the gust\nto glide donwward for ten meters or so. At this\nintervened and the aircraft regained about 70 cm\n\nmeter from the\ndied down, it began\npoint a new gust\nof height.\n\nThe wind speed then decreased regularly for 18 seconds, and the\nvehicle glided to the ground after traveling approximately 35 meters\nin the air and losing approximately 1.5 meters of altitude. The\nexceptionally small slope of this glide sould be emphasized. It\nimplies an aerodynamic efficiency of 23 in still air.\n\n304\n\n/21\n\nSuch a finding is obviously erroneous. it was the excess air\nspeed at the peak of its trajectory that enabled the vehicle to support\nitself over such a long distance without losing very much height. The\nrelative speed of the wind encountered by the aircraft at different\npoints of its trajectory are marked on the figure. These numbers take\naccount of the fact that the wind includes not only the air mass\npassing over the anemometer during the 9 second flight, but also the\nmass of air that was located to the right of the touchdown point at\nthe same time as the aircraft.\nAs the wind\'s average speed was 6 m/sec, this latter mass had\nan approximate length of 54 meters. In its 9 second, 70 meter flight,\nthe aircraft thus encountered 134 meters of wind. It therefore had\n\nan average relative speed of 16 mjsec which represents what is necessary to provide lift. As you can see, such results are still pretty\nmeager.\nConclusions\nThere is reason to think that the combined employment of flight\nexperiments and calculations will one day firing about a solution to\nthe problem of soaring by means of horizontal winds.\nHowever ; the possibility of testing craft that can soar without the use of upward currents depends above all onthe success of\nresearch into the wind and its detection by the pilot. As long as\nthe magnitude of the wind\'s oscillations remains unknown to the\naviator, learning the proper maneuvers for making better use of the\nwind\'s energy will be long and painful.\nIn any case, what should be retained from all that has just\nbeen said about motorless flight is that such flight has enabled\nus to methodically study wing and fuselage characteristics under ,real\nconditions. Trying out gliders on propelled carts is too imprecise.\nIn a wind tunnel, too, the results can be in error. This is because\nof the difficulty in copying an aircraft exactly when making a small\nmodel and also because it is hard to make adequate measurements when\nair turbulence is not :recorded at the same time.\nTests of motorless flight have also resulted in increased\nknowledge of the atmosphere, whose effect on\xc2\xb0motorized airplanes is\nbeginning to be plain to all. This enables me to state that in\nthe last ten years, the scientific study of soaring has done more\nfor aeronautical progress than research in any other field.\n\n305\n\n/\'219\n\nRECOMMENDED READING\nMagnan, "L\'aviation sans moteur" [Motoriess Aviation], Bull. du Labor.\nde Morphol. et d\'Avia. de 1\'Ec. des H.

He has been able to closely copy sea gulls and vultures\nas they fly along without flapping their wings through the use of\nthermal and obstruction currents.\nMankind has also dreamed for a long time of flying like the\n\nmajority of birds, by flapping wings. It must be acknowledged that\nuntil now the results have been much less significant than those\n\nobtained in motorless flight. However, it seemed to me a good idea\nto remind you of the efforts that have been made and to show you what\ncould be achieved. The study of mechanical flapping flight should\nnot be neglected. It seems to me that it has much to contribute\nto reronautical progress. It is necessary to encourage unbiased\nresearchers excited by long research that can often be disappointing.\nDo ::,rr forget that it was such researchers, in their constantly\nrenewed individual experimentation, who created aviation.\nRemember Marey\'s incisive experiments for analyzing birds\'\nwingbeats. This great scientist was not content with his findings.\nHe tried to recreate wingbeats artificially through mechanical\nimitations.\nWe are going to examine Marey\'s experiments in this area and\nsee what results he arrived at.\nMarey\'s Experiments in Imitating Wingbeats\nIn order to imitate birds\' wingbeats in conditions easy to\nanalyze, Marey thought that the actual wings had to be replaced by\nthin surfaces of well-determined geometrical form. They would then\nbe abruptly lowered by releasing a spring of known force and the\nlifting force exerted by air resistance measured.\nriarey\'s Mechanical Bird\nFor this purpose, Marey constructed an apparatus in the following manner. (See figure 334.) A Y-shaped framework was placed\non a hollow m-shaped base in which lead shot could be inserted. This\npart of the apparatus .represented a bird\'s body. Its weight could be\nchanged at will.\nA long shaft was joined by a hinge to each branch of the frame.\nThe shafts were thinner at their tips and implanted in each of them\nwere steel, ribs supporting a thin fabric or paper sail representing\na flexible wing. Angular motion around the shoulder joint could be\t\nimparted to these wings. The wing surfaces had a visibly parabolic\nform. Their bases could be attached to a greatly stretched rubber\nband which curled around a pulley P further down on the machine. The\nrubber band represented the pectoral muscles. The pulley supporting\nit served to divide the tension equally between the two wings.\n\n307\n\n/221\n\nFigure 334\n\n\t\n\nMarey\'s Apparatus for\n\t\nImitating Angbeats\n\n\t\n\nFigure 335\nTheoretical Representation of\nPower and Resistance Moments\nin Marey\'s Apparatus\n\nOn the wings\' dorsal side, close to their base, were two\nhooks that came together when the rubber band was stretched and\nthe wings raised. A ring of thread thrown over the hooks held them\ntogether and kept the wings raised and the rubber band stretched.\nWhen the thread was burned, the wings were immediately forced downward by the feieasq of the rubber band. They quickly attained a\nspeed that remained constant even after they had passed the horizontal position. If. the machine was not loaded too heavily with lead\nshot, it would make a leap and reach a certain height. This was\nbecause of the reaction-of the air under the wings The functioning\nof this little machine is well suited to clearing u p the dynamic\ncharacteristics of a wingbeat.\nWe just saw that the apparatus imitating a bird\'s flapping\nwing jumped into the air at each wingbeat. If it were gradually\nloaded with lead shot there would come a moment when it would no\nlonger leave the table. At this moment the air\'s reaction to the\nwing\'s downstroke can do no more than support the weight ..,f the\nmachine. Marey thought that he could thus produce the conditions\nsurrounding a wingbeat during horizontal flight. In this case the\ndescending wing gives rise town air pressure equal to the weight\nof the body that it is supporting at a constant height. Marey\nstated that in such circumstances, the moment of air resistance is\nequal to the moment of the force of the rubber band. If, therefore,\nthe point of application under the wing of the air\'s total reaction\nforce were known, one could make the moment of the artificial muscle\'s\nforce balance it out. This would entail applying a force equal to\nhalf the body\'s weight at this point on each wing. At the same\ntime one would support the weight of the mechanical bird with its\noutstretched wings.\nMarey added that the point to apply the force corresponding to\nthe reaction of the air could be found by trial and error. It will\nbe recognized by the fact that an upward pressure at that location\nwill exactly balance the force of the rubber band and the weight\nof the machine.\nOnly one point underneath each wing satisfies these conditions.\nIt is situated two-thirds of the way along the wing, starting at the\nshoulder.\n\n308\ni\n\nThe theoretical representation (figure 335) shows, according\nto Marey,the apparatus in equilibrium, with the wings extended and\nraised by two forces rr\' applied two-thirds of the way from point 0\nto the end of the wing. The rubber bands ff\' are stretched and their\nforce is in equilibrium with the body\'s weight M, which is thus\nexactly supported.\nThis apparatus permitted the author, after a few modifications,\nto measure the mechanical effects of a wingbeat in all sorts of\nsituations.\n\t\n\n/222\n\nThe Mechanical Effects of a Wingbeat\n\nIn order to be able to determine rigorously the variations in\nthe height of the jumps, Marey modified his apparatus to make it\nusable with a graphic recording device.\n\nFigure 336\t\nMarey\'s Equipment for Repro-\t\n\nducing the Lifting of a Bird\'s \t\nBody duirng the Wing\'s Downstroke\t\n\nFigure 337\n\nHeights to which\nthe Wingbeat Lifted\nthe Apparatus with\nLoads from 95 to\n175 Grams\n\nFigure 336 shows the artificial bird mounted on a long light\nwood shaft TI joined through a hinge to the top of a column, In\nthis way, the machine leaped in an absolutely vertical plane. The\nshaft continued in front of the bird and ends in a pen for tracing\nthe height attained on a smoked cylinder. A pin g resting on a\nmetal arc supports the machine at a constant height. This height\nrepresents the minimum base point for the jumps, whose height depends on the force of the rubber band mm in relation to the weight\nlifted.\nLastly, the great physiologist made sure that the wings as\nwere always equally raised and the bands equally stretched in each\nexperiment. This indispensable precaution consisted of:. using a\n\n309\n\nwooden mandrel to fabricate a thread ring which linked the wings and\nheld the apparatus taut until it was burned. A set of similar rings\nwas thus obtained. The wings were always equally raised, and the\nrubber bands equally stretched.\nMarey did several series of experiments with this apparatus.\nVarious factors influencing the flapping wings were altered. First,\nMarey studied variations in the weight of the artificial bird.\nThe complete apparatus weighed 94 grams without any extra load.\nThrough the use of additional weights, the author made the load vary\nfrom 95 to 175 gram; and he obtained jumps of decreasing height.\nFigure 337 depicts the resulting weight curve. The height\nlifted up is the ordinate and the weight lifted is the abscissa. The\ncurve formed by the ends of the lines representing the height lifted\ndoes not correspond to a proportional relationship between the load\nand the amplitude of the movements. However, if the weight lifted is\nmultiplied by the height of the jump, the product decreases regularly\nand its magnitude is inversely proportional to the weight lifted. f\nMarey concluded that "given a constant quantity of motive work produced,\nthe greater the mass of the machine, the smaller the quantity of work\ntransmitted to this mass is."\nInfluence of Variations in Motive Force\nMarey then conducted a second series of experiments to study\nvariations in motive force. He changed the force of the rubber\nband motor in the following way. His technique was based on the\nfact that a homogeneous rubber tube always develops the same pulling\nforce when a given length is stretched by the same amount. He thus\ntook three pieces of the same length and used first one, then two,\nthen three at the same time to produce the mechanical wings\' downstroke. Each of the rubber bands developed a static force of 900\ngrams. Marey thus worked with three motors pulling at a force of\n900 grams, 1800 grams, and 2700 grams. He was able to document the\nprogressive increases in-the amount the machine was lifted corresponding to the progressive increase in motive force, as well as the lack\nof proportionality between the two. (See figure 338.)\n\n/223\n\nInfluences of Variations in Wing.Area\nMarey continued his work by investigating the dffect of changing\nwing area. To study this he first compared the variation in height\nresulting from variations in load for wings of different surface\nareas. Figure 339 r produces the heights machines with wings of\n700 cm2 and 1,092 cm z were lifted to. The first machine is represented by the solid lines and the second by the single dots. As you\ncan tell, the influence of wing area is negligible after a certain weight.\nIt is interesting to note that the machine used weighed 900\ngrams. This weight is greater than that of many species and equal to\nthat of such birds as the buzzard and the herring gull.\n\n310\n\n3\n\n5009r.\t\n\n400 jr,\n1\n\nFigure 338\nDifferences in the Height\nto which the Mechanical\nBird is Lifted Depending\non its Weight and Motive\nForce\n\n2\n\nL44\n\nFigure 339\nEffect of Changing\nWing Area on Lift\nHeight.\n\nInfluence of Tran slatio nal Movement\n\nMarey also experimentally studied the influence of translational movement on the nature of wingbeats. He demonstrated that\na wingbeat encounters more air resistance when the flying creature\nhas a high enough horizontal speed.\nMarey first of all mounted an artificial flier on his circular\ntrack for studying birds (figure 340). The machine\'s wings were\nput in motion by a pneumatic device. With the aid of manometric\ncells, he recorded the wingbeats (figure 341) and noticed that the\noscillations diminished in amplitude as their length increased. This\ncorresponds to what is observed in nature.\nHe then used two thin, rigid planes .5 meter long by .1 meter\nwide as wings., He locked them together and could lower them by\nreleasing a rubber band. This crude flapping machine could move\nforward with the aid of a device for rolling on a horizontal metal\nwire f (figure 342). As part of this setup, two large pulleys RR\'\nwere placed at the ends of a table. In their grooves was an endless\ncable c, one of whose strands was parallel to f and attached to the\nmechanical bird, which it pulled at varying speeds.\n\n/224\n\nMarey tried first to measure the machine\'s s peed and then the\nduration of the wings\' downstroke. Since the artificial bird\'s speed\nwas the same as the endless cord\'s, the wire was made to roll over a\nsmall pulley I, whose revolutions were marked on a cylinder turned by\nmeans of a system working like a Morse telegraph. To make the recording, the pulley \'I had a metal armature attached to half its perimeter.\nThe armature controlled the current of a battery S by closing two contacts. An inscribing stylus put in motion by an electromagnet in the\ncircuit traced a change in direction for every 0.20 meters the cable,\nand therefore the bird, had moved-. Thus, the faster the bird moved,\n\n311\ny\n\nthe greater the number of humps inscribed on the cylinder in a given\ntime. A second electrical signal S\' served to determine the duration\nof the wings" downstroke. This was done with the aid of a device\nmounted on the bird which opened the circuit at the beginning of the\nwings\' descent and closed it at the end. The length of the recording\nstylus\'s deviation, which was controlled by an electromagnet, thus\nindicated the duration of the wings\' downstroke.\n\n15t^\n\nT\t\n\nT\t\n\ni1\n\nt\t\n\nr\n\nFigure 340\nMarey\'s Mechanical Bird\nSetup with Circular Motion\n\niVV ^ r `^.,/ ^..,..-\xe2\x80\xa2.rte--^^ .^,...,_,^`.\n^\n\n^,...,.yw...^.......i=....h!+rN IV^.R.bV.\\e\xe2\x80\xa2 w V^nry a,.\'+3v^\xc2\xab.n*\n\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2 YM\n\nFigure 341\nDecrease in Mechanical\nBird\'s Wingbeat Amplitude\nDuring Circular Motion\n\none oecond\n\t\nits _\n\ni\xe2\x80\x94\t\n^ ^`\t\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2^y-\' i^ 1 M\n\n..\t\n\nrR\n-\n\nFigure 342\nMarey\'s Experimental Setup\nfor Measuring Wingbeat\nDuration during Linear\nMotion\n\nFigure 343\nVariations in Wingbeat\nDuration According to\nSpeed of Apparatus\n\nMarey then made a series of experiments in which he obtained\nthe simultaneous recording of the flapping apparatus\'s forward speed\nand the duration of its wings\' downstroke (figure 343).\n\n312\n\n\t\n\nIn the first experiment, there was no linear motion. Of the\nresulting traces, the upper one shows the downstroke duration, which\nis 1/3 second. This can be seen.by comparing its length with the\nlength of the time scale.\nIn a second experiment, the mechanical bird moved forward at\na moderate speed. Its tracings indicate that a distance of 3 meters\nwas covered in one second. They also document the increase in the\t\nduration of the downstroke caused by this forward speed.\nLater experiments proved that downstroke duration always\nincreases as translational speed grows. However, Marey was not able\nto find the exact relatonship between these two variables.\nII. Prewar Ornithopter Tests\nInstead of trying to carry out precise experiments asMarey\ndid, several inventors have sought to create flapping wing apparatus\nthat could be made to fly by copying the way birds flap their wings.\nSome of them were fully successful in tests of small scale models.\nAmong the attempts at reproducing the flapping :flight of birds,\nthose of Hureau de Villeneuve, Pdnaud, and Tatin should be cited.\n\nFigure 344\t\nHureau de Villeneuve\'s\t\nOrnithopter\t\n\nFigure 345\t\nPdnaud\'s\t\nOrnithopter\t\n\nFigure 346\nTatin\'s\nOrnithopter\n\nHureau de Villeneuve\'s Bird\nIn Hureau\'s 1872 bird (figure 344), the axes of rotation formed\nan oblique angle with each other and with the axis of the body.\nchanges in the plane of the wings were caused by the direction of the\njoint. The bird had a remarkably powerful wingbeat. Each beat lifted\nit up forcefully, but there were not many of them. The vehicle first\nclimbed to a height of 1 meter and then parachuted back to the ground.\n313\n\nRik\n\n/225\n\nA year later Hureau had a much larger model of his vehicle\nbuilt with a 1.5 meter wingspread.\n\nPdnaud\'s Bird\nIn Pdnaud\'s vehicle, the axes were parallel to each other and\nto the axis of the body (figure 345).\n\nChanges in wing plane were made by giving a certain mobility\nto the ribs around the wing spar and consequently to the fabric\ncovering them. The ribs were then adjusted by means of a small\nrubber band. The effect of this device was that when the wings were\nthrust downward, their rear edge was partly raised up at the end of\nthe storke. During the upstroke, on thecther hand, the edge stayed\ndown, which gave the airfoil an accentuated downward and rearward.\nslant. The goal of this arrangement was to provide both lift and\npropulsion at the same time, and in the way it occurs in nature.\nPdnaud\'s mechanical bird could not ascend vertically, it appears. /226\nHowever it moved horizontally with rapidity and even climbed at a\'\nslope as high as 20%. Duringg a public test it is said to have taken\non speed by flapping vigorously and performed a rapid horizontal\nflight over a distance of 9 meters. it then curved and climbed 5\nmeters into the air while gradually losing speed. After hovering in\nthe air, it descended and took on speed again. It gained height once\nmore and finally landed in front of the spectators as its wings slowed\ndown.\nTatin\'s Bird\nBeginning his research in 1873, Tatin followed the same route.\nHe built a small apparatus weighing only 5 grams out of microscopic\nparts. It worked very well. He also set up another apparatus which\ncopied bats (figure 346) and obtained some very successful flights.\nTatin next wanted to expand, and he put together an apparatus\nthe size of an eagle, but lighter. He equipped it first with a steam\nengine and then with a pneumatic motor. Despite all his efforts,he\ncould not obtain any true flights, only some descents at various\ninclinations.\nAder\'s Bird\nAder first sought the solution of the problem of flight through\nHe constructed a large bird with flapping\nimitating natural birds\nwings designed to carry a man and to be propelled by his muscular\nforce.\nTatin claims that Ader carefully copied nature as accurately\nas possible in building his machine. The vehicle represented a large\n\n314\n\nbird with.a. 9 meter wingspan. All its sections were in the correct\nproportion and, probably to make it as close as \'possible to its model,\nit was \'entirely covered with artificial feathers. The feathers were\ncomposed of a central shaft of flexible wood on each side of which\nnatural feathers were inserted to take the place of barbs. The large\nfeathers were as numerous as on the model bird and arranged in the\nsame way. Lastly, the articulations were the same as in the natural\nwing, up to that of the \'hand at the end of the limb. And it all\nworked. The motive force was obviously insufficient. What tests\nwere made? It is unknown, says Tatin.\nThis was the first full -scale test.\nFull -Scale Ornithopters\n\nOthers followed, with varying conceptions of what has been\ncalled an ornithopter.\nThus, in 1908, J.J. Bougart, of Colmar, created a flapping wing\nairplane weighing 50 kg. It included four wings which moved like\nthose of a dragonfly and had a surface area of 16 m 2 . Two men, one\nbehind the other, were supposed to maneuver the wings so that their\nposterior ends were lowered at the. same time. Flights of 200 meters\nat a height of 1.5 meters were successfully made with this apparatus.\nAnother orni,thopter was built by J. Collomb. It included two\nwings that oscillated vertically about a hinge. They were made of\nwood strips jointed like the slats of a jalousie. During the downstroke, the strips overlapped so as to form a continuous surface.\nThey separated from each other during the upstroke and were inclined\nat an angle of 15 0 . The rods controlling all this activity were set\nin motion by a 40 hp motor. They could produce three wingbeats a\nsecond without endangering the component parts. The vehicle\'s empty\nweight was 250 kg. (See figure 347.) Its test flights do not seem\nto have yielded interesting results.\n\nFigure 347\nCollomb\'s Ornithopter\n\nFigure 348\nSoltau\'s Ornithopter\n\n315\n\n/227\n\nGilbert Temploux designed a 60 kg vehicle with a 5.50 meter\nwingspread. Its two wings were flexible at their ends and trailing,\nedges.\n\nWhen thrust upward,the wings attacked the air at a small\nPositive angle. When going downward the wings struck the air from\nfront to back at a negative angle.\nTemploux\'s test model made several satisfactory flights. The\nbest was one of 168 meters covered in 12 seconds. The machine rose\nto a height of 6 meters.\nLet me also mention the Soltau ornithopter of Vienna\n\n(figure\n\n348). It was a copy of birds of prey and had a wing spread of 14.6\nmeters with a wing width of 2.5 m. The vehicle rested on springs\nover a three-wheeled chassis. It had a liquid air motor and flapped\n90 times a minute.\n\nIII. Modern Ornithopters\nSince the war, attempts at flying by flapping have been taken\nup again throughout the world.\nParticularly in France, certain inventors have recommenced\nthe struggle, difficult as it is, to carry their ideas to a successful\n\nconclusion.\nThe Rouquette Apparatus\nIn the first place, let us recall Rouquette\'s attempts. He was\nalready striving to build flapping wings before 1914.\n\nHe originally constructed wings with ribs made of steel\nplates. The wings were fixed to a harness worn by the pilot. (See\nfigure 349.) The vehicle\'s flight weight was 88 kg, including the\npilot. The author sought to accurately reproduce wingbeats and he\nsucceeded in cancelling out his weight with each wingbeat. He verified this by being hooked to a dynamometer.\nHe later created a vehicle with two pairs of wings mounted on a\nbicycle frame. A piece of lead was placed on the pedal sprocket to\nact as a flywheel. The inventor was one of those who had noticed\nthat at the end of the downstroke, the bird leans against its wings\nand, with the help of its pectorals, lifts its body. Through the\nuse of the eccentric mass of lead, he was able to lift his body at\nthe moment when the wings were thrust downward. His system was mounted\non springs and he inscribed the displacement of the springs, and\ntherefore of the body, on a cylinder. The recordings thus obtained\nrevealed that in the end he was losing almost as much height as he\ngained.\n\n316\na\n\nFigure 349\t\nThe Rouquette Flapping\t\nWind Apparatus\t\n\nFigure 350\nG. Roth\'s Flapping\nWing Aircraft\n2281\n\nThe Roth Apparatus\n\nG. Roth came up with a highly .ingenious flapping wing vehicle.\nThe wings were endowed with flexible metal quills (figure 350),\nwhich were imbricated and connected by elastic joints. In this way,\nthe wing surface during the upstroke was much smaller than during the\ndownstroke.\nThe wings\' alternating drive train was comprised of a gear\nbox, a reduction gear, a set of transmission gears, and two rotating\nplates holding off-center pivot pins. Connected to the pins by a\njoint were the rods that directly ;drove the wings. In this way the\nwings were forced to flap at an average amplitude of 85\xc2\xb0.\none of the motive plates included a slot for holding a threaded\ndevice capable of maintaining the wings in a horizontal position\nduring gliding.\nThe L. Kahn Apparatus\n\nL. Kahn\'s theory of flapping flight was summarized above.\nHere is his mechanical application of this theory.\n\nh\t\n\nFigure 351\t\n\nWhen the element ab (figure 351) describes\nan undulated surface in the fluid, the points b\nand a successively describe the same trajectory.\nThey consequently have the same trajectory relative to their support structure. However, point.\na is constantly behind point b, and its trajectory,\nrelative to the support structure, is behind that\nof b. Since a follows band passes through the\nsame points in space, a\'s motion is always out of\nphase with b\'s\n\n317\n\nin this manner the law governing orientation is always synchronized with the law governing displacements on the condition that\nthe two generators of the airfoil describe identical, out of phase\npaths. One is thus confronted with a very large number of variables:\nOn the one hand in the form of the orbital motion, which can be\nadapted to different flight conditions, while always following the\nlaw governing orientation. On the other hand is the phase difference,\nwhich controls the angle of incidence with the trajectory and, finally,\nthe relation of the profiles to the source of propulsion.\nA particularly simple case is given by the author in which the\norbital movement is circular and uniform relative to the support\nstructure. As far as following the law governing orientation is\nconcerned, it is sufficient to give an out of phase circular and\nuniform motion to he two generators. Moreover, the mechanical solution can be simplified with the help of the following remarks:\nSuppose that the hodograph of the orbtal motion could be described. By simple\ndisplacement of the center of the hodograph,\nthe hodograph of the motion relative to the\nfluid can be obtained. The radius vector\nof the new hodograph is, by definition,\nparallel to the tangent of the motion relative to the fluid. It therefore sufficE.s\nto make the airfoils parallel to the tangent. Now, the hodograph of uniform circular motion is a circle. From this comes\nthe especially simple solution of figure 352.\nL. Kahn meanwhile pointed out that\ncircular motion is not the most efficient\nsort. When hovering, wing motion should\nresemble a kind of horizontal, stationary\nsculling. A "complete" apparatus should\ntherefore be capable of both movements, as\nwell as all the intermediate ones between\nvertical or stationary flight and high\nspeed flight.\n\n/229\n\ns\n\nJ1t\t\n\n1,\t\n\n, e;\n\n\t\n\nN\n\nFigure 352\nHodograph of a Flapping\nWing\'s Motion Relative\nto the Fluid\n\nThis is the goal pursued by the author in the construction of a\nmore complicated vehicle.\nIn order to establish the orbital motion spoken of above and\nalso the orientation of the wing so that it had the des4red inclination at every moment, L. Kahn - \t\nadopted the following device:\nThe machinery was capable of creating a given orbital curve\nthrough the use of a system of three rods (crank, connecting rod,\noscillating shaft), which is depicted very clearly in figure 353.\nThe wings describe a figure 8 during vertical or stationary flight.\nThe oval drawn with a dotted line is the curve corresponding to full\nspeed flight. Between the two, all forms are possible. Any point. A\non the connecting rod could describe the orbital curve. In reality,\nhowever, this is done by a point o on the rod determined in such a\n\n318\n\n,^1\n\nP\n\nway that there are five different ways to regulate the point\'s\nmotion. Furthermore, the pilot has the ability to change the axis\nof oscillation so as to modify the orbital curve as the situation\ndemands.\n\nBleu!/ aai^s\n\n*1\nSUPAVC0\nore^lrc-zf\n\n7^ ^\xe2\x80\xa2t^,`^^prdta\n\n\t\nFigure 353\n\t\nThree Rod System Used \t\nin L.

It is capable of rising\nfrom the ground, supporting itself in the air, and moving forward\n\nthorugh the action of a propellor turned by an engine. The propellor gives it a certain horizontal speed andthe resulting reaction\nof the air on the aircraft\'s fixed wings causes a rapid displacement\nthrough the atmosphere.\nIt is therefore because of the propulsive system, propellor and\nengine, that the airplane can find the necessary supporting forces\nin the air to give it lift. This is why an airplane starts to descend the moment its speed drops tothe point that it is no longer\nsufficient to maintain horizontal motion. If the airplane is well\ndesigned, it will then glide back toward the ground, at least if it\nis not too close to the earth. Here, a sudden fall could result from\nstalling because the lifting forces turn out to be less than what is\nrequired.\nI. Description of an Airplane\n\na\n\n\tb c\n\nTr\'\'\n\nr^"\n\nrot/vrrnv/(,/r\nd/rt c1. nn e\n\nAn airplane is an apparatus\nthat always possesses a longitudinal\nand vertical plane of symmetry. Its\nbasic components are the following\n(figure 358):\n1) A body with a system of propulsion.\n2) A set of wings.\n\nFigure 358\nSchematic Drawing\nof a Monoplane\n\n3) Controls and control sur-\n\nfaces.\n\nKey a) Propellor e) Vertical\n4) Take off and landing equipment.\nb) Wing\t\nRudder\nf) Horizonc) Aileron\t\ntal Rud- The Fuselage\nd) Axis of\t\nfuselage\t\nder\nThe forward part of the body,\ng) Landing\t\nalso called the fuselage, generally\nGear\t\ncontains an engine holding a propellor,\nan open or closed cockpit, and lastly\na cabin for passengers or cargo. In the rear are two fixed planes.\none is vertical and controls drift, while the other, the stabilizer,\nis horizontal and maintains longitudinal stability.\nThe Wings\nAttached to the body are the wings, or airfoils, which include\none or more wing spars supporting metal or wood ribs covered with\nplywood or thin fabric.\n323\n\ni\n\nD\n\nFigure 359\nSchematic Airplane Wing\nxx\', Axis of Symmetry,\nAB, Wingspan; EH, Depth\n\nFigure 360\nCross Section\nof an Airplane Wing\n(STA Profile no. 206),\nAB, Cord\n\nTransverse\n\nThe wings are always elongated inthe transverse sense, perpendicular to the direction of the airplane. They have a plane of\nsymmetry xx\'\' (figure 3 59)p and they all display a profile, i.e.\na transverse cross section, EH possessing a special curvature. The\nexact curvature As chosen according to what wind tunnel tests on\nmodels show increases the favorable reactions of the air during\nflight.\nIn general, the upper wing surface is convex. It constitutes\nthe extrados. The lower surface is concave and constitutes the\nintrados. Cinder these conditions, the line AB (figure 360) is\ncalled the wing cord.\nIf we look again at figure 359, the length AB is called the\nwingspan, and the length EH is the depth. The ratio of the wingspan to the depth is called the aspect ratio. The edge AB is the\nforward or leading edge, and the edge CD is the rear or trailing\nedge.\nIn the monoplane design that we are considering for the moment,\nthe attachment of the wings is generally accomplished by means of\nrods forming the wing pylon, which join the wing spars to the\nfuselage. Very often, streamlined masts also unite the region near\nthe middle of each half wing tothe airplane\'s body to give a greater\nsolidity to -the frame and stop the surfaces from being lifted and\nbroken by too large an atmospheric reaction.\nThe Control Surfaces\n\nThe control surfaces are planes that the pilot can maneuver\nand orient at will in relation to the avera5a direction of the airplane. Thanks to their manipulation, he can direct the displacement\nof his vehicle. He can make it climb or descend, turn, bank, tip,\nor bring it back to its normal position if it should diverge from\nits route for some reason. The control surfaces include two rudders.\n\n324\n\n/233\n\nOne is the elevator or horizontal rudder for controlling altitude.\nIt is mounted on a hinge behind the stabilizer and can be raised or\nlowered. The other is the vertical rudder, which controls direction.\nIt too is mounted on a\'hin4e, and it can be displaced laterally.\nFinally there are the ailerons, which are small, moveable horizontal\nplanes mounted on a hinge at the trailing edge and tip of the wing.\nThey are lifted or lowered in opposite directions\t\nto change the\ninclination of the airplane from one side to the other.\nThe Controls\nEvery control surface can be activated\naid of various devices that he has in front\njoystick, which allows him to raise or lower\nailerons, and the rudder bar, which perraits\nrudder to the right or left.\n\nby the pilot with the\nof him.

Longitudinal displacement is communicated by means\nof cables and kingpins to the elvator, which is thus raised and\nlowered. The cables are crossed in such a way that pushing the joystick forward lowers the elevator and causes the airplane to dive,\nwhereas pulling the stick toward the pilot raises A-_-and.\'- 1 `-.makes the vehicle rear up.\nMoving the stick to the right or left operates the ailerons.\nFor example, if the stick is moved toihe right,the right aileron is\nraised and the left one is lowered ( figufe 362).\nThe rudder bar is placed horizontally and transversely relative\nto the major axis of the vehicle. It is workedl^y \xe2\x80\xa2the pilot\'s feet\nand can pivot in a horizontal plane about a vertical axis attached\nto its middle. Each end of the bar is linked by a cable and king325\n\n/234\n\npin to one of the sides of the vertical rudder.\nII. Types of Airplanes\nPresent-day airplanes are designed for flying above-ether the\nland or the sea. Because of this, although they are built along\nthe lines described above, they nevertheless possess characteristics\nthat clearly distinguish them.\n\n1\t\n1\t\n1\t\n\n,\n,\n,\n\n1\t\n1\t\n\n[\n^.\n\nFigure 363\nDesign of the "Potez 36" Monoplane\nTerrestrial Airplanes\nTerrestrial airplanes (figure 363) have a special structure\nfor arrival and departure known as the undercarriage. The latter\nincludes a chassis attached tothe forward part on the fuselage.\nThe chassis supports the wheels and shock absorbers, which allow\nthe airplane to roll on the ground during departure so as to acquire\nthe speed necessary for takeoff and to absorb the speed and shock of\narrival: This is the landing gear. The undercarriage also includes\na stand located at the rear end of the fuselage which diminishes\nrolling distance during landing by rubbing against the ground.\n\nL\n\nFigure 364\nDesign of the "Liore and Olivier 22" Seaplane\n\n326\n\n/235 l\n\nSeaplanes\nThe second group, the seaplanes, are built to ,land on the water.\nThey are either equipped with floats attached to the chassis in the\nplace of wheels or they have a hull that constitutes both the\nfuselage and the float.

(.See figure 364,\n\nAmphibians\nLastly, there exist amphibian airplanes which have both a hull\nand retractable landing gear and can land on the sea or the ground\nequally well.\n\nVarious Airplane Configurations\nFinally, one should note that there are airplanes whose\ndesign differs from that of the classic monoplane described above.\n\ni\nIV\n^N\ny\nIJ\t\n\n1\nt\t\n\ni Qi J\t\n\ni\t\n\n;\t\n\n^^\n\ni\nt\n\nFigure 365\nDesign of the "Moth-Morane" Biplane\nSome of them have superposed wings and are called biplanes\n(figure 365). Others, the triplanes, have three wings superposed.\nAirplanes have even been constructed with wings made up of a great\nnumber of planes arranged in such a way that they actually resembled\nVenetian blinds. In multiplane types, the superposed wings are\nbraced to one another with poles and guy wires, so as to be almost\ninflexible.\nAirplanes or seaplanes are not necessarily equipped with only\na single engine. They can have two, three\', four, or even more. In\nfigure 366 there are two engines. They are attached at each end to \t\nthe central fuselage in a fusiform housing located below or even\nabove the wings. They can also be in front of each fuselage when\n\n327\nNO\n\n/236\n\nthe airplane has two. Many multiengine airplanes have a flight\n\nweight of 20 (metric) tons and wingspans\n\nof 50 meters.\n\nFigure 366\nDesign of "S.E.C.M. 140 M" Multiengine Monoplane\nA joystick is not very practical for such large airplanes and\nmaneuvering them in a high wind is very tiring for pilots. For\nthis reason, the stick is modified. It still has a shaft that can\nbe moved frontwards and backwards, but it can no longer move to the\nleft or the right or, therefore, work the ailerons. Their operation\nis controlled by a steering wheel attached to the upper end of the\ntube and which pulls on a chain when turned. The chain in turn turns\na pulley on which the aileron control cables are rolled up. The\npilot can thus operate the ailerons with greater strength by holding\nthe wheel with both hands. However, it sould be remembered that the\nsteering wheel is inferior in terms of handling and efficiency to the\nordinary stick. The stick is very sensitive and responds better to\nimpulses. It can also be manipulated with one hand. For these\nreasons, it is more suitable for rapid aircraft of varying motion,\nsuch as fighter aircraft.\nIII. The Reaction Forces of the Air\n\nIn the beginning, research into the reaction of the air on\nairplane wings, i.e. of the laws of air resistance, was based on\nthe principle of relativity. It was assumed that the reaction of\na current blowing against the front of a stationary body was\nidentical to that engendered in the air by a body moving within it,\non the condition that the speed of the current and the body are\nequal.\nLift and Drag\n\nWorking under this assumption, wings of reduced size were\na horizontal air current of known\nplaced in a wind tunnel\nspeed. The wings were in addition suspended from a balance so that\nthe magnitude of the air\'s reaction could be measured.\n\ncontaining\n\n328\n\nIt was then found that the air\'s reaction is manifested by a\nforce R that passes through a certain point on the plane of symmetry\ncalled the center of pressure and is proportional to the square of\nthe air current\'s speed.\n\ni\n\nYaw a\n\nI^\nI\n\nFigure 367\t\nResultant R of Aerodynamic\t\nForces Exerted on a Wing\t\nand its Components Ry (Lift)\nand R. (Drag)\n\nFigure 368\nPolar Curve of STA\nWing Profile no. 206\n\nKey: a) Wind\nThe forces may be resolved into two others (figure 367),\none vertical, R,, which is the lifting force, and the other horizontal, Rx, which is the force resisting forward motion (drag), such\nthat one has:\nRz = KzSV 2 and Rx = KxSV21\nwhere S is the wing area and Kz and K. are the appropriate coefficients.\n/237\n\nAngle of Attack and Polar Curve\n\nIf the wing is placed obliquely in a horizontal air current\nso that its cord makes an acute angle with the direction of the wind,\nthis angle is called the angle of attack or incidence and is\ndesignated by the letter i..\nThe coefficients K and Kx are always constant for a given\nwing profile and angle of attack.\nThese coefficients are measured in a wind tunnel for all\nangles of attack. The polar curve (figure 368) for each wing is\nS\n\n329\n.:\xe2\x80\x9e^\n\ndrawn based on them. For each polar point, representing a given\nincidence i, K z or C z = 16K z is the ordinate and K or Cx = 16KX\nis the abscissa. The ratio C^/C is called the aefodynA efficiency\n[lift to drag ratio] of the ai.rp Kane. It varies with the angle of\nl\nincidence and is at its minimum at the point where the tangent of\nthe polar curve goes through the origin. In practice, as is\nshown on the figure, the abscissa represents 1000 X and the ordinate\n1000 z, with different units of length.\nThe same operations have been carried out on mockups of\nentire airplanes, as we will see further on.\nIV. Different Modes of Flight\n\nWe are going to examine various features of airplane flight,\nLet us immediately take note of the fact that when studying mechanical flight, we will be especially preoccupied with the center\nof gravity. As you know, the center of gravity\'s motion is the\nsame as if all the airplane\'s mass were concentrated in it and all\nthe external forces were applied there. The speed of the center of\ngravity relative to the ambiant milieu is called the air speed.\nStraight Horizontal Flight\n\nFirst of all, let us take the case of a vehicle of weight P\nflying horizontally at a constant speed V and at a given altitude\nwhile keeping its plane of symmetry vertical.\nThe forces exerted on the center of gravity are:\nP, the weight,\n`t, the propellor\'s traction or pulling force,\nRz, the lift, and\nRX , drag.\nIn order that there be horizontal flight at constant speed,\nit is necessary that all these forces be in equilibrium. Now, as\nwe are going to see, some of, these forces are variable. Thus, the\npull of the propellor depends on the angle of attack. Look again\nat the polar curve in figure 368. For a point M o corresponding to\n0), the pulling\nan incidence i in which there is no lift (R \t\nforce of the propellor is very large (figure z 369). The traction\no\nthen decreases until it reaches a minimum at point M m , Which- corresponds to the point where the tangent to the polar curve passes\nthrough point 0. After this, the pull increases once again.\n\n330\n\n/238\n\n.r\t\n\nM,\nr\ni\t\n\nr\t\n\nr\n\nr\t\n\nr\n\nw\t\n\nr\t\n\nr\nr\nr\n\n^\t\n\nr\n\n1p\n\nFigure 369\nPropellor Traction vs.\nAngle of incidence\n\nAs you can see, for any\npulling force other than that\ncorresponding to the optimum angle\nof incidence im for which the pulling force is at its minimum, there\nexist two possible incidences and\ntherefore two modes of flight. One\nhas a small incidence and low lift\nand therefore a high rate of speed-.\nThe other has a large incidence and\nlift, and therefore a low rate of\nspeed. Consequently, to have the\nlargest area of action, one should\nfly at the optimum angle.\n\nThe power that is useful and necessary to horizontal flight\nat a given altitude reaches its minimum at an incidence i2r a\nlittle larger than the optimum angle. There is therefore an indispensable level of power for providing lift. Because of this, at a\nlevel of power above the minimum, there are again two modes compatible with the given amount of power. One corresponds to flight at\nan incidence below i 2 and is at a high rate of speed. The other is\nat an incidence greater than i2 and is at a low rate of speed. In\npractice, the first mode is the only one utilized. The second is\ntoo dangerous as a result of the ease with which it gives rise to\nstalling.\nIn this summary, we have considered an airplane flying at an\nunspecified altitude. Is it always true that altitude has no effect,\ngiven the variations in density that exist? Current thinking is\nthat the air\'s reaction forces are proportional to its density.\nThe preceding equations thus become:\n/\nRZ, = KySV 2tddo and R x = KXSV2d\n\n/do,\n\nwhere do is the air density at ground level and d the density at the\naltitude under consideration.\nAs for the power necessary to provide lift, it is inversely\nproportional to the square root of air density if the angle of\nincidence is held constant.\nGliding\n\nAs soon as the engine stops turning, the airplane is no longer\nable to fly horizontally. Gravity forces it to descend by gliding.\nThe slope of the trajectory is always at a minimum at the optimum\nangle of incidence. This is the slope that allows the apparatus to\nland -the furthest from its point of departure. However, and this\nmust be stressed, it is impossible for it to descend at a smaller\nslope than this minimum.\nHere again, there are two modes of descent, one rapid for\nsmall angles of attack, the other slow for large angles.\n\n331\n\nWe have seer, that for gliders two speeds could be considered.\nOne is horizontal, and the other is the vertical sinking speed.\nIn gliding, the horizontal: speed keeps growing as the angle\t\nof attack decreases. Beyond this, when the descent is very long, the\nhorizontal speed varies and is inversely proportional to the square\nroot of air density when altitude decreases. In contrast, when a\nglide is performed with little loss in altitude, there is no reason\nto take into account the variation in height.\n\n/23 9.\n\nVertical speed is at a minimum when the angle of attack is\nlarger than the optimum angle and is in the vicinity of the angle\nof minimum power.\nClimbing\n\nOne says that an airplane is\npoints obliquely upward.\n\nclimbing\n\nwhen its trajectory\n\nThere are two cases to consider in a climb: either the nilut\nmakes the climb by giving more power to his engine without changing\nthe angle of attack; which he makes equal to the angle for flying at\nhis ceiling, or he flies at full speed, but alters the angle of\nattack. In the first case, the pull of the propellor increases\nwhile the Flight speed remains the same, and the vehicle follows\nan upward trajectory. In the second case, which is commonly employed\nin performance tests, the airplane climbs because traction increases\nwith the reciprocal of aerodynamic efficiency, Rx/Rz, and therefore\nchanges with the alteration of the angle of attack. This means that\nthere is minimum traction at the optimum angle. During a climb,\nthe speed of ascent decreases in a continuous fashion.\nI should point out that in a complete study of ascending\nflight, it is also necessary to consider the propellor, whose\nrotation and efficiency are also linked to variations in altitude\nand angle of attack. However, this is outside the limits of the\npresent account.\nCeiling\n\nAn airplane has to be capable of rising up to a certain height.\nWhen its trajectory is pointed upward, the climbing speed is\nalways smaller than the speed in horizontal flight, but the difference is close to zero when the angle of incidence is small.\nAn airplane close to the ground finds that its engine has a\npower that is always superior to the minimum power necessary for\nhorizontal flight. The difference between these powers is called\nthe excess power capacity.\n\n332\n\n4\n\nAn airplane climbs until the excess power that it possessed\nnear the ground has disappeared. As a matter of fact,the power\nused in horizontal flight goes up with altitude and the power produced by the engine diminishes with altitude. There thus exists\nan altittde which cannot be surpassed. This is precisely the height\nat which the power furnished by the engine is equal to the minimum\npower necessary\nsupply lift. Such an altitude is known as the\nairplane\'s ceiling, for which the angle of attack is always greater\nthan the optimum angle. The slope required to reach the ceiling\nis always proportional to the excess power.\n\nto\n\nLet me add that it is possible to make an aircraft exceed\nits normal ceiling by stopping its power from decreasing with\naltitude. This has been done with such devices as Rateau\'s supercharger, which increases the pressure of the air entering the\nengine to that of ground level.\nV. Airplane Stability\n\nIn the study that we have just made of airplane motion, we\nconsidered only the movement of the center of gravity. In reality,\nunder the action of exterior forces or because of maneuvers it is \t\nperforming, an airplane oscillates around its center of gravity\nduring flight.\nIn order that an airplano progresses through the air properly,\nit is indispensable that its oscillations not take on exaggerated\nproportions capable of dangerously destabilizing it. The abnormal\noscillations that might occur must be eliminated either automatically\nor through the action of the pilot.\n\n.r\n\nf\nt\n1\n\nFigure 370\nAxes of an Airplane\n\nFigure 371\nAn Airplane\'s Angle of Roll\n\n333\n6-.l\n\n/240\n\nFigure 372\t\nAn Airplane\'s Angle of Yaw\t\n\nFigure 373\nAn Airplane\'s Angle of Pitch\n\nThe stability of an airplane is considered relative to three\nrectilinear axes passing through its center of gravity (figure 370).\n1) The horizontal major axis Gx, which is the major axis\nof the plane of symmetry and about which the plane rolls (figure 371).\n2) The axis Gz, the second axis of the median plane which\nis vertical in an airplane\'s usual position and around which it can\noscillate in a horizontal plane or yaw (figure 372).\n3) The axis Gy perpendicular to the plane of symmetry, or\nthe transverse axis around which an airplane can oscillate in a\nvertical plane, i.e. pitch (figure 373).\nThe motion of an airplane therefore takes place in three directions: vertical, longitudinal, and transversal. Its stability in\nflight must therefore be assured in these three directions.\nThe airplane\'s Stability thus includes three distinct stabilities: one horizontal to oppose pitching, another lateral.. to oppose\nrolling, and the last, known as directional stability, to oppose\nyawing.\n\nLongitudinal Stability\n\nLongitudinal stability, about the transverse axis Gy, is\nobtained partly by means of certain planes located on an airplane,\nsuch as the fixe/a horizontal stabilizer of which I have already\nspoken. If an airplane starts to nose up, under the influence of\n\n334\n\na sudden wind, for example, the stabilizer\'s angle of attack\t\nincreases in relation to the relative wind and the result is an\naugmentation of the air\'s reaction force. This creates a torque\ntending to level off the vehicle and return it to its normal flight\nposition. The stabilizer plane also has a helpful influence during\noscillations in the vertical plane. It dampens such oscillations by\nplaying the role of a brake.\nIt should be added that experience has shown that the best\nreactions are obtained when the stabilizer is attacked from above.\nThey are therefore mounted with a certain upward incidence, which\nmake a sort of longitudinal V with the wings of the airplane.\nStabilization by the fixed horizontal, plane is automatic. It\nis said to be intrinsic to the airplane.\nLongitudinal stability can also be controlled by an appropriate\nmaneuver with the joystick. The pilot can in fact make his vehicle\noscillate as desired about the axis Gy. If he pulls on the stick,\nhe raises the elevator, which is mounted on a hinge in back of the\nstabilizer. This makes the airplane rear up and consequently start\nto climb. If he pushes on the stick, he obtains the opposite result.\nHe lowers the elevator, causing the airplane to go into a dive and\ntherefore to descend,\n\nFigure 374\t\nWings Forming a Dihedral\t\nor Vertical V\n\nFigure 375\nFlexed Wings\n\nLateral Stability\n\nAutomatic lateral stability, about the major axis Gx, is\nobtained through the use of she vertical tail fin located behind\nthe fuselage. It acts in a similar manner to the stabilizer to\nstraighten out the airplane and dampen oscillations, and its role\nis analogous to that of the keel in a boat. The airplane\'s intrinsic\nstability can be facilitated by giving the wings the form of a\n\n335\n\n/241,\n\nvertical V (figure 374). Under these conditions, the airplane\nconstitutes a veritable anti-roll riechanism, with the restoring\n\ntorque increasing along with the wingspan.\nIn addition, the pilot can manually control longitudinal\n\nstability.\n\nBy moving the joystick to the right, for example, he raises\nthe right aileron and lowers the left one. This has the effec t of\n.\nmaking the airplane lean to , the right and consequently of creating a\nrestoring torque if the vehicle is leaning in the opposite direction\ndue to outside forces.\nTransverse Stability\n.Stability in a transverse direction is here too automatically\nacquired with the help of the fixed vertical tail fin. If the airplane turns toward the left for any reason, the vertical tail fin\nwill make a certain angle with the relative direction, of the wind.\nIt will therefore be pushed more on the right side, which will\nforce the tail back to the proper direction. The intrinsic stability\ncan be supplemented by giving the wings a flexed configuration\n(figure 375), like that of certain rapidly flying birds. If the\nvehicle turns to the left, for example, the right wing will be\nmoved forward and will be pushed on more than the left wing. The\nairplane thus will automatically return to its course.\n/242\n\nManual control of transverse stability is obtained by manipu_\nlati-ag,the vertical rudder. If the pilot pushes the rudder bar to\nthe left, he will also move the rudder and therefore the airplane\nto the left.\nVI. Maneuvers and Acrobatics\nAs everyone has noticed, an airplane doesnot always fly horizontally in an absolutely straight trajectory. It does not always fly\nflat out, as they say in aeronautical circles. It can be made to\nperform certain popular maneuvers as the pilot desires, as is the\ncase for fighter aircraft. The same maneuvers can also occur accidentally, outside of the will of the pilot. This can happen to any airplane, even a commercial one, under the effect of outside forces.\nAmong these maneuvers, called acrobatic: when fighter aircraft are concerned, some are standard, such as the following:\n\t\nLoop\nFlat Turn\n\t\nRenversement\nVertical \tBank\nSide\t Slip\nBarrel Roll\nDive\nNormal Spin\n\t\nPull-Out\nFlat Spin\n\n336\n\ni\n0\n\nTurns and Side Slips\nWe have seen that by moving the rudder bar to the left, the\npilot causes the vertical rudder to be pushed to the left. This\ncauses the vehicle to turnabout the Gz axis, or, more precisely,\nmake a flat turn. In order that a turn be successfully completed\nby a vehicle traveling at a certain speed, whether it be locomotive,\nautomobile, or airplane, the velocity must remain within the plane\nof symmetry. If not, the vehicle skids off course or, in the case\nof an airplane, side slips. This is remedied by tilting the machine.\nFor an airplane moving in a circle, one seeks to create an\nequilibrium among the forces acting on the center of gravity: the\nweight, the reaction of the-air, the pull of the propellor, and\ncentrifugal force. In particular, centrifugal force is balanced\nwith the forces of lift, which have to be greater during a change\nin course than in straight horizontal flight, when weight alone plays\na role. The increase in lift is provided by ,augmenting engine output and the angle of attack.\nIt follows from this that an airplane cannot veer properly\nunless it has a large excess power capacity relative to the minimum\nvalue necessary for horizontal flight. If not, it will stall.\nSome turns are so tight that the airplane seems to have a\nvertical wingspan at a certain moment. This maneuver is commonly\ncalled vertical banking.\nDives and Pull-Outs\nTo make a dive, the pilot pu mhes strongly on his joystick.\nThe elevator is abruptly lowered wile the airplane is flying\nflat out. The airplane turns about its lateral axis\'Gy and begins\nto descend with its major axis more or less vertical. Its translational speed thus rapidly increases by as much as 50%. When the\ndescent is made with the engine at full power, it is called a nose \t\ndive. In these ci:+rcumstances, very efficient aircraft can attain\nconsiderable speeds,, which the Americans claim can range up to\n800 km/h. Such descents are generally executed at the decision of\nthe pilot and are possible in fighter aircraft. They can also be\nproduced by such other causes as the pilot\'s sickness or a forward\nshift of the vehicle\'s load.\n\n/243\n\nWhen the pilot judges that his dive has lasted long enough,\nhe puts an end to it by pulling on his joystick, which makes the\nairplane rear and describe a curved trajectory ending with its nose\'\npointing upward (figure 376). As we will see, this maneuver, which\nis called a pull-out, is among the most dangerous, even with elevator\nangles of only a few degrees. The airplane\'s frame undergoes considerable stress and the machine can break if the stick has been\nrapidly moved by a large amount.\n\n337\n\n4\n\nSuch a maneuver could be mandatory if the vehicle suddenly\nstarts to dive for any reason. It is the only way to level off.\nMoreover, this often occurs automatically when the airplane\'s speed\nhas reached a certain limit.\n\nFigure 376\t\n\nA Dive and Pull-out \t\n\nFigure 377\n\nA Loop\n\nLoops\nLoops are a classic acrobatic maneuver thought up by Pdgoud.\nIt is easy enough if the pilot pulls the joystick towards him when\nthe airplane is descending slightly at full speed. (See figure\n377.) The aircraft then rears, levels off, and tips upward almost\nvertically while its speed diminishes at the same time. Little by\nlittle, it describes a loop in such a way that it flies upside down.\nAt this moment, the airplane seems to be hanging in the sky as if\nits speed had suddenly been reduced to zero. It then completes the\nloop by diving toward the ground and descending faster and faster.\nIn this way, it is lifted up again little by little and resumes horizontal flight, which the pilot obtains by pushing the joystick back\na little.\nLooping is sometimes done in the opposite way, by making the\nairplane first dive and then fly with its wheels-upward.. The .airplane\nYkext noses up and climbs before reestablishing a level position.\nRenversements\n\nRenversements begin like loops. However, before arriving at\nthe top of the loop and finding himself upside down, the pilot performs -a sort of rotaton about the transverse axis which tips the\npropellor back downward and puts the airplane into a dive. The\nairplane next veers more or less tightly and returns to its line\nof flight,\n\n3\' 3 8\n\n}\n\nBarrel Rolls\n\n\t\n\n/244\n\nFigure 378\nA Barrel Roll\n\nBarrel rolls are a true\nrotation of the aircraft\naround its horizontally p?aced\nmajor axis, with one difference.\nThis is that the vehicle does\nnot actually turn about its\nlongitudinal axis, but rather\ndescribes a helix about it as\nit advances horizontally. (See\nfigure 378.)\n\nSpin\nTraditional spins are basically a sort of barrel roll performed with the airplane\'s longitudinal axis directed downwards\nand with a speed of descent that is sometimes fairly large. (See\nfigure 379.) Characteristic of this maneuver is that the controls\nremain effective and the pilot is the absolute master of its\nduration, since he can exit from it whenever he pleases.\nFlat Spin\nIn contrast, during flatspin\n(figure 380), the airplane\'s fuselage\nis inclined very little. It no longer\ndives at a certain speed while spiraling around a vertical axis. On the\ncontrary, it turns rapidly around a\nvertical axis passing through a point\non the-wing instead of through its\ncenter of gravity. The airplane is\ncompletely devoid of translational\nspeed. It slides along the vertical\naxis and approaches the ground in the\nsame way as a cardboard rectangle\nrotating around a long thin shaft\nstuck in to it near one of its corners\nwould.\nFigure\n379\nNormal\nSpin\n\nFigure\n380\nFlat\nSpin\n\nUnlike what occurs in a classic\nspin, the controls no longer have any\neffect and the influence of the horizontal and vertical rudders and the\nailerons is absolutely zero.\n\nIt is a fact that an airplane in flat spin will remain in it\nuntil it crashes into the ground.\nAt the present time ., there does not seem to be any effective\nremedy for this state of affairs. Neither increasing engine output\n\n339\n\nto its maximum nor ejecting special loads placed outside the center\nof gravity, which supposedly would make the airplane go into a dive,\nappears to be capable of stopping flat spins. As the Germans in\nparticular argue, only the appropriate construction methods seem to\nprotect the pilot from this tragic eventuality.\nVII. Flight Safety\n\nThe study of all these maneuvers, whether initiated consciously\nor not, is very important, as we will see.\nAccidents in the air often appear to be the consequence of\n/245\nerrors in handling the aircraft or material failure-. Statistics \t\nhave proved that 51% of French aeronautical accidents, whether maritime,\ncivilian, military, or colonial, can be blamed on pilot errors.\nThis is the result either of faulty judgment or a lack of technical\nknowledge on the part of the pilot.\n\nout of 500 accidents resulting in an inquest, 350 were attributed to a mistake in piloting or imprudence, while 35 were considered to result from material defects and 10 from bad weather.\nDo not forget that when maneuvering additional reaction force\nagainst the wings can be created. This can make an insufficiently\nresistant airplane break up in flight. Similarly, high winds\nengender supplementary stresses than can also fatigue the wings.\'\nThe future of aviation is therefore linked to the safety that\nthe pilot and passengers must be assured of having during their\nairborne travels. In line with this, a complete study and description of all the supplementary forces that arise in flight should be\nmade, and the indicated changes in aircraft construction introduced.\nThe, future of aviation is also linked to the ,average speed aiplanes can be endowed with. Airplanes must go faster than other\ntypes of transport: automobile, railroad, boat. Their speed must\nalso be achieved with a minimum of fuel. The builder is thus forced\nto diminish or eliminate all sources of passive resistance and to\nobtain as high aerodynamic efficiency as possible.\nThis is why we will examine in the coming lessons how progress\nin airplane construction is in direct relation to the amount of\nsuccess there is in determining exactly the speed of the vehicles,\nthe acceleration caused by maneuvers and atmospheric disturbances,\nand, finally, the aerodynamic efficiency of airplanes. The data\nfurnished from such experiments will allow the necessary improvements\nto be made in airplane design and construction.\n\n340\n\nRECOMMENDED READING\nAlayrac, Mdcanique_de 1 1 aviation [Aeronautical Mechanics],\nGauthier-Villars, Paris 1926).\nBlanc, Toute 1 1 aviation [All about Aviation], Paris (1930).\nBouasse, La rdsistance des fluides [Fluid Resistance], Delagrave,\n\nParis (1928).\nJoukowski, Bases thdori ues de l\'Adronauti ue: Adrod nami ue [The\nTheoretical Bases of Aeronautics: Aero ynami.cs , Gaut i.erVillars, Paris (1916).\nLeroux, Cours d\'Adronautigae [A Course in Aeronautics],Beranger,\nParis (1927).\n\n341\n\nEighteen: Methods for Studying Airplanes\' Stresses, Trajecand Speed in Flight\n\n/246.\n\nWithout ignoring the difficulties of creating airplanes, both\ncivilian and military, resulting from the multiple requirements made\n\nfor each category, one cardinal fact dominates the whole question of\naviation. As must be acknowledged, this is the problem of safety.\nSafety is an obsession with aeronautical technicians, as well\nas for all those interested in flight. It merits particular attention in view of its humanitarian and utilitarian character.\nAircraft safety depends above all on an exact knowledge of the\nstresses imposed on aeronautical structures during flight.\n\nUntil recent years, people were more or less content to make\nhypotheses concerning the particular conditions to be found in each\ntyre of flight. They then mathematically deduced the added stress\non the vehicle.\nThus, the safety formula applied at the end of the war by the\nService Technique de l\'Adronautique was derived from the study of\npull-outs, or vertical dives followed by sudden leveling off. The\nleveling off, whose curvature and duration were arbitrarily chosen,\ncould be used to obtain mathematical results whose magnitudes depended on the more or less uncertain data serving as a point of departure. The added stress due to eddies and gusts of wind was also\narbitrarily evaluated or even held to be negligible.\nThe study of the fatigue supported by airframes during\nflight is therefore of preponderant importance. This is what\naffects the resistance of fighter aircraft in the course of the\nvarious maneuvers they have to perform, as well as the transport\ncapabilities of commercial aircraft.\nSeveral government agencies have been preoccupied since the\nwar with experimentally determining the stress supported by airplanes\nin flight.\nHuguenard, Planiol, and I proposed to make such determinations\nourselves with an airplane flying in air of varying turbulence.\nWe had several approaches available to us for that purpose.\nI. Cinematographic Method for Determining Flight Stress\nFirst of all, the cinematographic method using the camera gun\nwith coordinate grid and double objective, of which we have already\nspoken, enabled us to measure the exact trajectory of an airplane\nin the course of its maneuvers.\n\n342\n\nd\n\nDetermination of Speed and Trajectory\n\n\t\n\n/247\n\nWe knew the position of the center of gravity in the full\nscale vehicle and therefore marked it with a dot on each film\nenlargement by superposing the appropriate template.\n\nNext we traced on a sheet of square-ruled paper a grid equal\nto the sides of the coordinate network in the photographs. The\nsuccessive positions of the center of gravity were transferred to\neach square with the aid of a div,Aar. The points were joined together so as to form the trajectory described by the airplane.\n\nFigure 381a\t\nConstant Velocity Straight\t\nTrajectory Followed by a\t\nGourdou-teseurre Airplane\t\n(Propellor Motionless)\n\nFigure 381b\ncurved Trajectory Followed\nby a Gourdou-Leseurre\xe2\x80\xa2 Airplane\n(Propellor Motionless)\n\nIf the points representing the positions of the center of\ngravity are approximately in a straight line and if the distance\nbetween them is approximately equal, they describe a straight trajectory at constant velocity (figure 381a).\nThe trajectory\'s slope angle $ relative to the horizon is then\ndetermined with a protractor.\nIf the trajectory is a curve (figure 381b), and consequently\nof variable speed, it is easy to find the average radius of curvature\nand the inclination of the speed for each part of the trajectory, for\nexample at the end of every second.\nThe distance of the airplane can also be determined. It is\ndeduced from the length of its image on the film, its true length,\nand the focal distance of the objective, for example.\nThe path traveled by the center of gravity from one position to\nanother divided by the number of intervals, and then multiplied by\n16 (since the camera speed is 16 frams/sec) gives the apparent speed\nu on the enlargements, as we have seen.\nThe real speed in meters per second is then:\nV = UL/l,\n\n343\n\nwhere L is the airplane \' s true length and 1 its apparent length on\nthe photographs.\nCalculation of the Acceleration Normal to the Wings\nIt is possible to use these data to calculate the value of\nthe normal component of acceleration for every second.\nAs a given point on the trajectory let the radius of curvature\nbe represented by R, the instantaneous speed by V, and let the angle\na represent the angle made by the half. - normal opposed to the center\nof curvature w^th a downward vertical line. The normal acceleration\nis obviously V /R- However, the projection of the acceleration due\nto gravity, g cos a, on the half - nromal must always be added to this\ncentrifugal acceleration.\nUnder these conditions, the total acceleration directed along\nthe normal is:\n\n/248\n\n(V2/R) + g cos a.\n\nThe ratio of the total acceleration to g is then:\ny\t\n\n(V2 /Rg )\n\n+ cos a.\n\nII. Accelerometric Method for Determining Flight Stress\nThe acceleration caused by the resultant of the various forces\nto which an airplane is exposed can also be measured directly.\nThis\n\ni\n\ns done with an accelerometer.\n\nWhen a mass M is acted on by a single force F or by a group of\nforces having F as the resultant, knowledge of the acceleration r of\nM\'s center of gravity at every instant allows one to calculate the\nmagnitude of F by the equation:\nF = Mr (1)\n\nDirectly measuring the acceleration thus provides the means of\nmeasuring the resultant of the aerodynamic forces exerted on a projectile or airplane moving in the air.\nAn accelerometer includes an accelerometric mass m, small in\nrelation to the mass M under consideration, and linked to this mass\nM by a dynamometer.\n\nIf the assembly is pulled by F and takes on an acceleration r,\nappreciably the same as before, the dynamometer is in equilibrium\nwhen M has taken on the same acceleration r. It then indicates a\nforce f. One can write:\nf\t\n\nmr (2)\n\n344\ny\t\n\n_\n\nThe value of r can thus be found, and as a result the force F\nalso. A comparison of equations (1) and (2) gives:\ns,\nF = fly/m.\t\nThe force that imposes the motion under study on the system is\ntherefore simply obtained by multiplying the dynamometer rending by\nthe ratio M/m.\nThe indirect measurement of the force F is the major job of\naccelerometers. If the dynamometer is graduated in successive multiples of the weight of the accelerometric mass, the readings directly\ngive the ratio of the acceleration r to the acceleration due to\ngravity, or, if you wish, the ratio of the force F to the mass M.\nThe H.M.P. Accelerograph\n\nHuguenard, Planiol, and I created a recording accelerograph\nfor the purpose of studying acceleration in flight. It includes\n(figure 382) a cylindrical column of mercury of density d, Length L,\nand cross sectional area S. Its axis is .parallel to the acceleration.\nto be measured. The mercury is set against an aqueous liquid which\ntransmits the pressures caused by the acceleration to a special\nmanometer M.\nIn addition, a valve R, placed in the liquid column linking\nthe mercury to the manometer allows the accelerograph to be adjusted.\nThe accelerograph\'s intrinsic frequency is given by the equation:\n\n/249\n\nT = 2,n d L KS ,\nwhere K is a coefficient measuring the volumetri elasticity of\nthe manometer tube. For a tube swelling by 1 mm for every 1 kg/cm2,\nK has a value of 10 9 (CGS) .\n\nIn order that the manometer readings remain constantly proportional to the acceleration, the following conditions have to be\nfulfilled. The manometer must not exhibit any solid friction. The\nintrinsic period of oscillation of either the system as a whole or\nits different parts has to be shorter than that of the phenomena to\nbe measured, if they are periodic. If they are not, then it must be\nshorter than the duration of the shortest variations inthe phenomena.\nLastly, the dampening has to be adjustable by fluid friction, to\nthe exclusion of all others.\nA reservoir of compressed air A equipped with a bicycle valve\nV allows the air at the end of the column of mercury in opposition to\nthe manometer to be compressed. Thanks to this device, it is possible\nto measure accelerations directed in both directions without having\nto fear that the column of liquid would break if large negative\naccelerations occurred. If the tube is placed horizontally, with\nthe manometer to its right, the pressure indicated b y the manometer\ngoes up when the acceleration ispointed to the left. It goes down\nif the acceleration ils pointed to the right. Obviously, the variations\nare proportional to the accleration imposed on the apparatus.\n345\n\nH:\n\t\nFigure 382a\n\t\nSchematic Cross Section \t\nof H.M.P.

The tube constitutes a sort of\ntuning fork with hollow branches connected by two flexible plates\nto a needle or mirror. Their short period ranges from 2 x 10 -2 to\n3 x 10- 4 seconds.\nPress for Calibrating Manometers\nWe created a press for studying these manometers. While it is\neasy to calibrate manometers accurately for measuring moderate Ares\nsures of 2 to 3 kg/cm 2 , for example with a mercury manometer in free\nair, the calibration of high pressure manometers is a problem.\nOur press is composed of a tri- \t\n/250\npod base with threaded adjustable feet\non which is screwed a hollow cylindrical\nbody. Inside the cylinder there is a\npiston with a cross sectional area of\n1/2 cm2 . (See figure 383.)\n\nFigure_ 383\nH.M.P: \'Press for\nCalibrating Manometers\n\nThis hardened steel piston is\nvery long and is extensively grooved.\nThe purpose of this is to reduce both\nthe area of contact, and thus the\nforces of viscosity, and also leaks.\n\nThe top of the piston ends in a socket which can hold a hind of\ncylindrical sleeve. Ring-shaped weights are places over the sleeve\'s\nspindle and their centers of gravity are thus over the head of the\nPAGE IF\n346\n\npiston.\nThe same sleeve holds two guide fingers that force the piston\n\nto follow it when it is made to rotate. This motion has the effect\nof reducing to the absolute limit the axial friction between the\nsurfaces in relative rotation.\nThe piston forms an excellent seal. Ina pressure of 50 kg/\ncm2 , it takes it about 6 hours to complete its course when the\ncylinder is filled with castor oil at a temperature of 20 0 and a\nquarter of an hour when liquid parafin is used.\nEven with liquid parafin, the time available is more than\nenough to completely calibrate a manometer for rising and falling\npressure without having to refill the press.\nWhen working under a load of 15 kg, or 30 kg/cm 2 , the piston\nstops in about 2 minutes after starting with an initial rotation of\n1 revolution per second. This makes it unnecessary to install a\ndevice for maintaining rotational speed.\nThe actual diameter o5 the piston is 7.977 mm. Its cross\nsectional area is 49.983 mm , or only 3/1000 less than the planned\narea of half a square centimeter.\nHaving put two presses, each loaded with 25 kg (p 50 kg/cm2)\nin equi:libridm and made both pistons turn at a good speed, two or\nthree grams are added to one of the pistons to induce a very small\ndownward motion. By transfering the extra load to the other side,\nthe motion is reversed.\nThe exact limit is difficult to observe because of the extreme\nslowness of the motionsproduced.\nEven though the precision thus obtained is very far from that of\na good mercury manometer, it is nevertheless more than enough for practical purposes. The apparatus, which is much easier to handle than a\nmercury manometer several decameters high, has proved completely satisfactory in the many calibrations in which is has already been used.\nFor example, it has enabled us to trace the hysteresis cycle\nof a high precision diaphragm manometer from 0 to 10 kg/cm 2 . In\nthis way, we could see that the cycles\' maximum width was less than\n2/1000 of the maximum pressure. Manometers capable of measuring\npressure with an accuracy of 1 in a thousand are thus foreseeable.\nAccelerograph Calibration Meth od\n\nThe presence of an air reservoir in the accelerograph is very\nuseful. The apparatus can be self-calibrated at any time, whether\nin the laboratory or in the field. If it is placed in a horizontal\nposition, and the air reservoir is open to the outside atmosphere,\nthe manometer reads zero. If the instrument is then stood up so as\nto be vertical, the point where the needle stops marks the acceleration\n/251\nq of gravity. If the accelerograph is put in a flat position again\t\n347\n\nand inflated with a bicycle pump, the needle is deflected. When the\npoint g is reached, the pumping is stopped and the apparatus stood up\nanew.\n\n\t\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2y\'\n\nI\n\nFigure 384\nCalibration of the Comilete H.M.P. Accelerograph No. 2,\nEquipped with a 5 kg/cm Manometric Tube; (reduced by 1/2)\nThe needle will start at the initial value y and move up to\na point that is obviously 2g. Recommencing the same series of operations, a graduation of the instrument in multiples of g is obtained\n(figure 384) .\nAfter several other types, we constructed an accelerograph,\ndesignated number 3, for aeronautical purposes whose period is\n1/75 second and sensitivity is 1 to 3 cm at g with a 14 cm pen\n(figure 382c).\nStudy of the Apparatus\'s Accuracy\n\nWe used a dynamic procedure to study the precision of the\nreadings furnished by our instrument in conditions close to those\nof actual use. The procedure was to make the accelerograph follow\na simple motion that was as sinusoidal as possible and to isolate\nmechanical data from the movement necessary for the calculation of\nits maximum acceleration. The results of the calculation were then.\ncompared to the measurements of maximum acceleration made by the\ninstrument.\nThe accelerograph was fixed to an elastic suspension whose\ncoefficient of elasticity could be changed as desired. The suspension was arranged so as to allow rectilinear translational motion\nparallel to the axis of a mercury tube. In these circumstances, the\naccelerograph adopts a perfectly sinusoidal motion when displaced\nfrom its equilibrium position. This is because the restoring force\nis proportional to the elongation.\nThe apparatus was suspended vertically between two highly\nstretched coil springs. The springs were arranged in such a way\nthat their line of action and also the axis of the mercury were\nvertical (figure 385). The first two conditions impart a vertical\ntranslational movement to the accelerograph. The third insures that\n348\n\nthe component measured equals the acceleration. An auxiliary\ndevice recorded the angular displacement on the accelerograph drum\nwith a stylus controlled by the instrument\'s vertical oscillations.\nIt was a very adequate resolution of the problem of measuring the\noscillating motion\'s amplitude and period.\nit is possible to calculate the maximum\nacceleration after the relation between the movements of the stylus as measured on the tracing and\nthe real displacement of the accelerograph have\nbeen determined.\nComparing the value thus calculated with the\nvalue Furnished by the tracing of the accelero\xe2\x80\xa2\ngraph itself reveals the amount of error in the\ninstrument\'s measurements.\nTests have been run at three different frequencies of oscillation: 2.05, 4.4, and 8.4 per\nsecond. The tracings obtained allowed the amplitude to be measured to within 1/10 mm without any\t\ndifficulty. The measured acceleration varied\nfrom \xc2\xb15 m/sec t to \xc2\xb122 m/sec ,with the actual\ndisplacement of the accelerograph rang3,ng from\n\n\xc2\xb13 to \xc2\xb150 Iran. (See figures 386 and 387.) Dif-\n\nferent tracings were made for each series of\nmeasurements of a given oscillation at different\nopenings of the dampening valve. These tests showed\n4hat as the frequency of motion diminishes, the\namount of dampening can be increased without increasing the amount of error. Also, it was always\n\nFigure 385\n\nAccel.erograph\nSetup for\nStudying Sinusoidal Motion\n\npossible for the frequencies studied to obtain a\n\nmargin or error less than O, and often of 1.5%, by\nmaking the appropriate adjustment.\n\n^^ i\t\n\nt \xe2\x99\xa6. s f i^ .^ a \xe2\x99\xa6+ : t a \xe2\x99\xa6 x\n\n!\n\nv\nFigures 386 & 387\nSinusoidal.

Apparatus\nTo become well acquainted with the operation of our accelerograph, we first used it to evaluate the acceleration found in\nvarious vehicles.\n\nFigure 388\nRecording of Acceleration in a 54-Ton Sleeping Car\nbetween Paris and Toulouse 1 sec = 3 mm; g = 2.2 cm\na) Measurement of Acceleration Imparted to a Railroad Car by\nthe Tracks\nThus, we sought to measure the magnitude of the acceleration\nimparted to a railroad car by unevenness in the tracks.\nThe tracing in figure 388 was made in a sleeping car with the\naccelerograph vertical, As you can sle, the acceleration was very\nsmall, on the whole less than 2 m/sec .\n\nFigure 389\'\nRecording of the Transverse Acceleration (Upper Tracing) and\nVertical Acceleration (Lower Tracing) in a First Class\nCar on the Paris-Marseille Express, 1 sea = 3.8 mm; g = 1.5 cm\nOther experiments took place on the Paris-Marseille express.\nFigure 389 shows at bottom the tracing produced by the accelerograph\nwhen placed in a vertical position in a first class car weighing 35\ntons and having four axles. The upper tracing waj obtained by placing\nthe apparatus in a transverse position at a point when the speed was\n88 km/h.\n\n350\n\nThe variation in vertical acceleration was in general less\nthan 1 m/sec . In the upper tra^ing, the variation is much larger.\nIts maximum was around 3.5 m/sec .\nIn addition, one can immediately see that the vertical agitation\nhad a much shorter period than the lateral oscillations. It was\napproximately a half second in the former and a second in the latter.\n\nFigure 390\nRecording of the Transverse Acceleration in a First Class\nCar on the Paris-Marseille Express between Lyon and Valence\nU sec = 3..8mm g = 0.75 cm\n\nFigure 390 reproduces the tracing of the transverse oscillations\nin the same car at the 464 kilometer point and at a speed of 102\nkm/h.\xe2\x80\xa2 Notice that t:h.o oscillations are much stronger here. The\nacceleration varies by 3 /sec on the average, but differences of\n7 m/sec or even 10 m/sec 2between the two extremes are frequently\nattained. These extremes are, moreover, practically symmetric in\nrelation to the median line.\nThe jolts recognizable by the spikes in the tracing occurred\nwhen the car\'s suspension bottomed out against the wheel assemblies.\nThe P.L.M. car was in fact remarkable for its poor suspension, and\nthe violentjolts made the trip unbearable. Meanwhile, the period of\ntransverse oscillation remainedthe same as before, slightly superior\nto 1 second.\nIt sould be added that since the paper unrolled at a speed of\n3.8 mm/sec and\t\nthe period of the oscillograph was at least 1/30\nsecond, the various oscillations visible on the tracings are not those\nof the intrinsic vibration., of the instrument.\nb) Measurement of Acceleration Imparted to an Automobile by the Road\nWe also experimented with our accelerograph in a Ford automobile,\nwhich resulted inihe recording in figure 391. For this tracing,\nthe axis of the mercury tube was placed parallel. tothe direction the\ncar was going in. Particularly in tracing 2, the oscillations caused\nby engaging the clutch and the fairly considerable acceleration (0.3 g)\ndue to starting off in-first gear can be seen.\nThe activity of the engine augmented the car\'s speed and the\nincrease in the engine\'s rotation showed up as a widening of the\ntracing. On the other hand, \'. , motive torque diminishes as the\nspeed of rotation grows. The accelerationis reduced\xc2\xb0and falls from\n.15 to .05 g: \'The passage to direct drive is marked first by a fall\nx .,\n\n.\t\n\nL^l\n-\n\n351\n\n253]\n\nin the acceleration towards 0, then by three jolts during engagement\nof the clutch, which lasted a little less than a second.\n\narraga^rehea\t\n\n3\n1.

At this moment, an\napplication of-the brakes produced a negative acceleration ranging from\n.30 to .33 g for 2 seconds. The brakes were then released in 1\nsecond and the car rolled, braked solely by the engine, which produced a negative acceleration of about 1/40 g. Next, the engine was\nspeeded up and a series of positive accelerations resulted. Finally,\nthe gas pedal was released and the acceleration fell to zero.\nTracing 3 of figure 391 was made by placing the axis of the\nmercury tube horizontally across the car while it was veering slightly to the left. Swerving to the right made the leftward centrifugal\nacceleration go up .33 g. This was immediately followed by a\nswerve to the left, producing a rightward acceleration ranging between\n.30 to .37 g. The swerves were sIzarp ones made on an asphalt surface.\nAfterwards, the automobile\'s course returned to a straight line.\n\n/254\n\nThe graph in figure 392 represents the recording of the\nacceleration imparted to the chassis of the same automobile by a\nbumpy road. The accelerograph was placed on the rear seat of the\ncar. The road involved was the one leading from the main route\nbetween Bourg-la-Reine and Versailles to the entrance of the STA in\nthe airfield at Villacoublay. This road is used by trucks carrying\ndisassembled airplanes to the aerodrome.\nOne can see that the acceleration frequently attained 2g. At\none point t1te chassis touched the rear axis, and the apparatus recorded an acceleration of close to 4 g, as shown on the right of figure\n392. Near this acceleration, a series of oscillations relative to\na period found throughout the tracing and occupying a length of 8 mm\n\n352\n\na\n\nare clearly distir.\xc2\xbbguishable. These oscillations represent the\noscillation of the rear axle on the springs, while the accelerograph\'s\nintrinsic period, about 1/32 sec, does not appear on the tracing.\n\nFigure 393\nRecording of the Vertical Acceleration of a Subway Station\nElevator (Place Saint-Michel) Left: Ascending; Right: Descending\ng = 1.2 cm\nc) Measurement of an Elevator\'s Acceleration\nWe also had the opportunity to use our accelerograph in the\nelevator of the Saint-Michel subway station. Figure 393 reproduces\none of the recordings obtained in the course of an ascent followed\nby a descent.\nThe acceleration, directed downward like gravity, is inscribed\nbelow the zero line, which represents g. At the beginning of the\nascent, an augmentation of %he apparent weight by a factor of 1/15\nis observable. The part of the tracing that follows corresponds to\nthe agitation due to the winch, the motion being uniform at the time.\nAt the end of this period, the current is reduced, and an acceleration\nopposite to gravity is produced until\xe2\x80\xa2.the moment when the elevator\nhits the bumper and stops abruptly. The result on the tracing is\nthat there is a series of oscillations in the course of which an\nacceleration of approximately 4 m/sec 2 can be isolated.\nDuring the descent, one witnessed first a relatively rapid\nfall causing a reduction in apparent weight by about 1/10. Then\nuniform motion sets in during which the agitation due to the winch\nis much greater than during the ascent.\nA first slowing down produces an Licrease in weight comparable\t\nto that occurring at the start of the ascent. Finally, the striking\nof the bumpers is indicated by a series of oscillations duirng which\nan acceleration on the order of 4 m/sec t is again exhibited.\nd) Measurement of Acceleration Caused by a Man\'s Pace\nIt is possible to take up the study of acceleration in various\nmovements, such as walking in humans and animals, with this same\naccelerograph.\nThe tracings in figure 394 show the displacement of a man\nholding the accelerograph in his hand, then going up and down a\nstairway.\n\n353\n\n/255\n\nFigure 394\nRecording of the Vertical Acceleration Caused by .a Man\'s Pace\nLeft: Apparatus Carried in the Right Hand (Top) and Left Hand (Bottom)\nRight: While Going Up (Top) and Down (Bottom) a Stairway\n1 sec = 28 mm\n\nFigure 395\nLeft: Recording of a Rocking Horse; Right: Acceleration in a Whip\nThe next tracings (figure 395) were obtained by recording the\nacceleration on a rocking horse and a "whip", a carnival ride.\n\ni\nf\n\nFigure 396\nAcceleration Recorded during\nLaunchings of "Robert Coton"\nParachutes\n\nLastly, figure 396 presents the recording of the\nacceleration caused by opening\na paracute supporting a 77.8 kg\ndummy. These tests, made\nby J. Mazer and J. Lemoine with\nour accelerograph, show that\nthe magnitude of the acceleration\nsometimes reaches 5 g in these\ncircumstances.\n\nSimultaneous Measurement of Air Speed and Stress\nTo carry out a suitable study of stress in flight, it was\nindispensable to record not only acceleration, but also an airplane\'s instantaneous speed. We developed a recording instrument\nfor this purpose.\nIn its present form, it is basically composed of a multiple\nVenturi tube, for example of the Badin type. This tube, which amplifies\n354\n3\n_.\t\n\n\t\n\nreductions in pressure, is linked to a metal manometer similar to\nthose we used for our accelerographs, only much more sensitive.\nIt differs from them in that the pen, directed as before by \t\ntwo elastic plates constituting the amplifier, is in addition mounted\non pivots. This arrangement, to which we were led by the desire to\nobtain a tracing free of vibration during motorized airplane flight,\nwas imposed by the very great flexibility of the manometric tube\nitself and of the supple control plates.\n\n,.\t\nac\t\n\nmounted it on the accelerograph\n\nframe in such a way that it could\n\n___....\n\n" -\n\nThe manometer, equipped with\na very light pen, has an intrinsic\nperiod of about 1/40 second.

The points\' average\ndeviation from the curve is 1.1 km/h, or 1 1/2% of the maximum speed.\nUnder these conditions, the average error in the measurements\nmade by the manometer is known to be 3%. The total average error in\nmeasurement of speed based on the manometric tracing is therefore\nequal to about 1/2% of the maximum speed.\nThe pressure reducing Venturi tube is mounted on the airplane\nin the usual manner, taking care to place it at a point where the\nspeed of the airflow is as close as possible to the airplane\'s air\nspeed.\nA. pipe of suitable diameter links the Venturi tube to the\nmanometer, whi^.h is placed with the accelerograph in the airplane\'s\nfuselage. The difference between the prevailing pressure in the\nfuselage and the pressure in the Venturi tube can thus be measured.\nIII. Comparison of Cinematographic and Accelerometric Methods\nThe two methods, cinematographic and direct measure, give\nsimilar results, as we are going to see.\nStudy of Flight Conditions in an Airplane\nFigure 398 reproduces the curves, shifted back to time 0, of\nthe flight parameters recorded during a level flight in a 180 hp\nGourdou-Leseurre airplane at its maximum value.\nOn the bottom is the tracing produced by the air speed _indicator,_ in the middle that of the accelerograph attached near the airplane\'s center of gravity in such a way as to record the acceleration\nperpendicular to^the wings, and on top is the tracing made by a stylus\nactivated by the joystick so as to inscribe the elevator\'s vertical\nmovements.\nThe recording was made at an altitude of 110 meters, with the\npilot flying horizontally at full speed over the airbase east of\nVillacoublay. Two passages over the base in o pposite directions are\nshown. In the first passage, the speed was close to 210 km/h during\nthe last ten seconds. The pilot then swerved sharply. The acceleration went up to 3 g, 4h eh corresponds to an inclination of 700\nabove the horizontal on the part of the airplane. This led to a\n\n356\n\n/257\n\nrapid fall in the speed, from 205 to 100 km/h in 3 seconds. After\nfinishing turning, the pilot returned to \'his line of flight and\npassed over the base again, this time at a rate of about 195 km/h.\nThe difference in the air speeds going and coming stems from the\nfact that the airplane was in a slight dive during the first passage.\nThis is revealed by the tracing of the elevator\'s movements.\n\no_._..,.....:.._,^..\t\n\n._\t\n\n........ ^ ^ . emu.\t\n\n.,^....,\n\n.._ ...,^.._......_.e...,.. ^..-. v.r.....<\n\nK#h\n204\n1tt?\n\n.2s\n\n=N1\n\nFigure 398\nSimultaneous Tracing of the Movement of the Horizontal Rudder G,\nVertical. Acceleration A, and Air Speed V of a Gourdou-Lesseurre\nAirplane during Two Passages over a Base, Separated by a\nVertical Banking Maneuver\nAt the same time as the recording was made, we used our equipment to film the airplane perpendicular to its trajectory.\nExamination of the film first of all enabled us to confirm\nthe existence of a slight dive during the first passage. The airplane descended with a slope of 4%.\nMeasurements made on thephotographs established that the\nground speed of the airplane, which was 410 meters from the objective, was 225 km/h when flying away and only 173 km/h when returning.\nThe first passage thus must have been made in a tail wind and\nthe second in a head wind, and the air current\'s speed was therefore\naround 26 km/h. The accuracy of the measurements is revealed by the\nfact that the airplane\'s average ground speed was 199 km/h while its\naverage air speed was 202.5 km/h.\n\n357\nF\n\ni\n\n/2581\n\nStudy of Looping\nWe then tried to record cinem, atographically the trajectory\nof the Gourdou-Leseurre airplane in the course of various maneuvers.\nAmong other things, we succeeded in following the airplane across\nthe coordinate grid with our camera gun during a series of three\nloops.

It s height was 100 meters, as compared\nto 67 meters for the next two. The first two were also much tighter.\nTheir width was only about 45 meters, while the first loop\'s attained\n89 meters.\nThe numbers marked on the trajectory indicate the time elapsed\nsince the start of the maneuver. The separations between the numbers\n\n358\n\ndocument the way the airplane\'s speed varied in the course of the\nmaneuver. Through detailed examination of the film frames, we were\nable to determine the vehicle \' s ground speed. We thus established\nthat the airplane \' s speed was 183 km /h during the first second,\n82 km/ h during the fifth,\t\n194 km/h during the tenth,\n46 km/h during the sixteenth,\t\n165 km/ h during the twenty-third,\nand only\t\n32 km/h in the course of the twenty - eighth second.\n\n/259\n\nWe then sought to use the airplane\'s trajectory to determine\nthe magnitude of the normal acceleration.

On\nthe other hand, the magnitude of the acceleration is greater in the\nfirst case. It should be pointed out, however, that the loops performed by Lt. Joublin in this experiment were tight. In particular,\nthe airplane \xe2\x96\xba s speed was very low and its acceleration practically\nzero at the top of the third loop.\nIn the next lesson, we will examine the differences between the\nmagnitudes Of the\'acceleration normal to the wings according to\nthe maneuver performed as well as that resulting from atmospheric\ndisturbances.\n\nX60\n\n\'r\na\n\nRECOMMENDED READING\n\nHuguenard, Magnan, Planiol, "Sur la mesure des efforts a4rodynamiques\n\nsupportes par la voilure d\'un avion" [The Measurement of the\nAerodynamic Stresses Supported by an Airplane\'s Flings], C.R.A.S.,\n(December 1, 1924).\nHuguenard, Magnan, "La mesure en vol des efforts et des ddformations\ndans la charpente des avions" (The Measurement in Flight of Stress\nand Deformation in Airplane Frames), L\'Aero_phile (1927).\nHuguenard, Magnan, Planol, L\'accdldro ra he H.M.P.; son application\na la mesure des accdlerations en vol [The I.M.P.

Here, the airplane\'s reaction is very rapid\nand there is no appreciable time interval between the moment when\nthe pilot starts to pull on the joystick and the moment when the\nairplane starts to nose up. On the left of the same figure we\nhave marked off the scale of acceleration in multiples of g. A\nscale, whose zero point is on the chain dotted line level with the\n4g acceleration ordinate, represents the movement of the joystick\nin proportion to the ordinates of the curve drawn with a broken\n\t\nline. Moving the joystick all the way to the rear shifted the\nstylus to the scale\'s top point, marked 25 0 .

In these two flights, the maneuvers,\nloops, and pull-outs, executed by Devillers produced similar accelerations. However, the joystick motion that gave rise to them is not\nat all the same. Devillers, who performed. the maneuvers recorded in\n\n363\n\nfigure 401, attained a vertical acceleration of 5 g in one loop by\nmoving the horizontal rudder 12 0 . Meanwhile, the pilot Christiany\ncaused an acceleration of 5.5 g in figure 400 in a loop in which he\ndisplaced the elevator more than 220.\nFigure 402 depicts the tracing\nof vertical acceleration during\nbarrel rolls and pull-outs performed\nby Devillers.\nWe also were able to study the\nvertical acceleration resulting from\nthe shock of a rough landing at the\nfield in Vauville. The acceleration\nhere attained 4.3 g, while in a very\ngentle landing with the same airplane,\nwe obtained 3.1 g.\nFigure 402\nSimultaneous Recording\nof Vertical Acceleration\nand Horizontal Rudder\nMovement (Pilot: Devillers)\nKey: a) Stick displacement\nb) Acceleration\nc) Stick\nT) Barrel roll\nRe) Pull-out\n\nIn addition, the pilot Devillers\nintentionally made a rough landing on\nJune 16, 1925, by letting his Gourdou\nairplane fall more than 1 meter to the\nground. The accelerograph recorded a\nvertical acceleration of more than 5 g\nin this case.\n\n/263\n\nAfter the landing, the undercarriage was found to have bent. This\nundercarriage had been designed to\nsupport five times its normal load.\n\nTest s with Captain Joublin\nWe had thus pointed out the desirability in simultaneously\nrecording acceleration, elevator movement, and air speed on the same\ntracing paper. This was an operation that had not yet been done.\nWe successfully carried out such experiments in 1926-27 and we are\ngoing to relate them here.\nFor this purpose, we used our accelerograph mounted on the\nstand to which we had attached a stylus driven by the joystick so\nas to record elevator movement, as well as the manometer of our air\nspeed indicator.\nCapt. (then Lt.) Joublin, who was a reinarkaL-Le test pilot, then\nperformed a series of acrobatic stunts with the instrument, whose\nstylus was linked by a thin cable to the joystick and whose manometer was connected with the Venturi tube by a suitable pipe. The\nVenturi tube itself was attached tothe end of a pole below the wing\nand located far from !the fuselage.\nThe first two experiments both included a loop and a-pull-out.\nThe tracings of the resulting curves are reproduced in figure 403.\nThey are all shifted back to time zero.\n\n364\n\n/264\n\nI\n\n1\n\n4\n\nK 11\n\nr?$\nao\nra y\nDo\n"I a\n\nd\n^.\nP\t\n\n5 acc,\t\n\n15\t\n\n10\t\n\n20\t\n\n2b\t\n\n9D\n\nKn\n\n200\n175\t\n\n...._.,\' :.^..^.,^.\n\n_,^.,_ _...^.__...\t\n\n.,_\t\n\n.^_\t\n\n.,...e\t\n\n_,..,...-\t\n\n^,..,..\n\n"^r,^\xe2\x80\xa2:^ ..,......---.\xe2\x80\xa2.\t\xe2\x80\x94.\n\n0._\n\n100\t\n\n10\t\n\n15\t\n\n2\n\nFigure 403\nSimultaneous Recording of Horizontal Rudder Movement G, Acceleration\nNormal to the Wrings A, and Air Speed V of a Gourdou-Leseurre\nAirplane in the Course of a Loop L followed by a Pula.-Out R\nTop: First Test;.

The variation in speed was .simultaneously\na good hundred kilomete? \xe2\x80\xa2s per hour. During the pull-out, the acceleration was a little larger and attained close to 4 g. Furthermore, a\nhigh degree of similarity between the two recordings can be seen.\nIn these tests, as in the ethers, the movement of the elevator\nwas very carefully ascertained beforehand. This enabled us to plot\nthe corresponding graduations on the diagrams. The position chosen\n\n365\n\nthat\n\nin which the plane containing the rudder coincides\nas zero is\nwith the fixed horizontal tail fin. Above zero are the angles\ncorresponding to climbing. This is when the elevator is raised.\nBelow zero are the angles corresponding to diving, when the elevator is\nlowered. Thanks to this scale, it is evident that the pilot is in\na climbing position, i.e. nosing up, much more when looping than\nwhen pulling out.\nThe experiments were followed up by repeating the same maneuver\nthree times on the same tracing.\n\nr\nS\n\nR\t\n\nS\t\n\n10\t\n\nIS\t\n\n70.\t\n\n75\t\n\n)/D\t\n\nAS\t\n\n40\t\n\nf!\n-\t\n\nlei\t\n\nPS\n\nFigure 404\nSimultaneous Recording of Horizontal Rudder Movement G, Acceleration Normal to the Wings A, and Air Speed V of a GourdouLeseurre Airplane during Three Successive Loops\n(Pilot: Joublin)\na-) Loops\n\nFigure 404 reproduces the tracings resulting from recording a\nseries of three successive loops, with the different tracings shifted\nso that their starting times coincide. The figure shows that the\nsecond and third loopsare fairly similar in terms of acceleration\nand elevator movement. The second peak in the acceleration curve of\neach loop corresponds to the return to the line of flight of the uir\nplane after it has fallen from the top of the loop that it has described. At the end of the first loop, this peak almost merges with\nthe start of the second loop\'s curve, which indicates that the pilot\nwent into the second loop upon leaving the preceding one.\n\n/265\n\nThis is confirmed by the tracing of elevator movement, which\nhas a much less accentuated downward direction at this moment and\nshows that the pilot did not attempt to take up the horizontal line\nof flight again. The speed, which attained 215 km/h after a slight\ndive at the beginning of the first loop, did not exceed 170 km/h at\nthe end of the first loop. It went up to about 200 km/h after the\n\n1\n\n7\n\nsecond loop and 150 km/h after the third. At the high point of the\nthree loops, it fell to the.- neighborhood of 60 km/h.\nThe acceleration in the three cases reached 3.5 g, much lower\nthan the magnitude obtained during our 1925 experiments involving\nflights by Christiany and Devillers.

He then pulled abruptly on the joystick. The acceleration rose to 4.3 g. In comparison, at the\nentrance to the dive it had fallen to 0, with a speed of 190 km/h.\nNote that the angular displacement of the horizontal rudder,\nwhich caused the considerable variation in acceleration, was very\nsmall. At the commencement of the dive, the displacement was 3 to\n4\xc2\xb0 and at the moment of leveling off, it was about 7 or 8\xc2\xb0.\nFigure 405 indicates that the acceleration then went down to\na level of about 0.5 g. Meanwhile, the speed diminished considerably and went from 225 km/h to 60 km/h in 9 seconds.\nA new dive followed and brought the airplane\'s speed up to\n205 km/h. The less rapid leveling off that the pilot performed, as\ndocumented by the elevator movement curve, was accompanied by an\nequally weaker acceleration, barely over 3.2 g.\n11 1.IG?\' ` AL PAGE IS\n.;\nOF POOR QUA.I\n\n367\n\n\t\n\nDuring the following ascent, the speed fell a little more than\nbefore and was about 50 km/h. Moreover, the airplane gave the earthbound observer the distinct impression of extreme slowness. It\nseemed to almost hover at the peak of its trajectory before\n:rushin%,toward the ground again for the third pull-out. The third\nmaneuver was even less forceful than the one before, since the\nmaximum acceleration did not exceed 2.7 g.\nLet me :..dd that the loops and pull-outs were performed at\nan average altidude of 500 meters.\n\n-_\n\nn\n\n74\t\n\nf r;\t\ni\n\ntar\t\n\n.....,\t\n.._\t\n\n\'1\t\n\n,>....,,...>\t w ..,..\t\n.^.e...-. .....^..^\t\n\n,.___._._,..- ...,... s, ..._...-.....^.....-..:,._.,..,..\n........, e....\xc2\xab\t\n\n-,^\n\n.\xc2\xbb^_\t\n\n_...^.,.-^.,,^.^..^.\t\n\n^.^\n\n1G!\t\n\n....,........._+...._...t.........a..a..._^.^_...._.....^.,.._..... .ate- - \t\nr:\t\nru\t\n+.\xe2\x80\xa2\t\nio\t\n^^\t\n\n\t\nJS\n\nao\t\n\n^s\t\n\nsn\t\n\nss\t\n\nso\t\n\nis\t\n\na..\n\nzu\n\nFigure 406\nsimultaneous Recording of Horizontal Rudder Movement G, Acceleration Normal to the Wings A, and Air speed V of a GourdouLeseurre Airplane in the Course of a Dive P Followed by a\nPull-Out R (Pilot: Joublin)\n\nc) Dives\nIn the beginning of figure 406, a very steep dive occurs. We\nhad asked Capt. Joublin to dive sharply, as close as possible to\nvertically, and then to let the airplane go as long as he thought\npossible without endangering himself.\nFigure 406 shows that after the pilot started the instrument\nrunning at the end of an ascent,the airplane\'s speed rapidly , grew\nfrom 90 to 275 km/h. At 250 km/h, a slight trembling was exhibited\nwhich is highly visible in the figure. The trembling was due to\nwing tip and aileron vibration at the end of the dive. They started\nto vibrate, as the pilot noticed, with such an intensity that the joystick was knocking against his hand like drumbeats. This phenomenon\n\n368\n\n/266\',\n\nled Lt. Joublin to level off so as to break his motion. The nosing\nup was performed very gently and resulted in an acceleration of 1.8 g.\nThe elevator displacement was only 4 to 5 0 . The vehicle then started\nto climb, and its speed decreased to around 35 km/h. The pilot next\ntook on speed until 150 km/h was reached. He then executed a\nrenversement, which made the speed fall again to 75 km/h. After\nthat, he gradually returned to his line of flight.\nII. Acceleration Due to Atmospheric Disturbances\nWe next sought to get an idea of the-magnitude of the inertial\nstress felt by an airplane as it passes through an air current\nrising after encountering a cliff. The area used for this purpose\nwas the glider field at Vauville.\ni\n\nThe Influence of a Sea Breeze\nThe airplane employed in the tests was the Caudron C.127\nbiplane.\nAt the time of the experiment, the wind at ground level had\nan average speed of 9.9 m/sec and was blowing from the WNW. At 100\nmeters up, the wind speed was appreciably the same, but was blowing\nfrom the W. The wind was of the sea breeze type already described.\nIt was fairly regular and contained small gusts whose amplitude at\nan altitude of 100 meters rarely attained a third of the average\nspeed. ?Above the ridge at Vauville, it had been deflected upward\nby its encounter with the cliff. In the meantime, it conserved its\noscillations and slight agitation.\nExperiments have proved that the inertial stresses engendered\nin an airplane by such a wind are small and do not exceed half the\nacceleration due to gravity, as figure 407 shows. This recording was\nobtained under the following circumstances.\n\nFigure 407\nRecording of Acceleration Norma]. to the Wings of a Caudron C.127\nAirplane while Passing through a Sea Breeze Deflected Upward\nby the Cliff at Vauville 10 sec = 23 mm (Pilot: Bdcheler)\n\n369\n\n^a\n\ni\n1\n\nThe airplane took off into the wind, i.e. perpendicular to\nthe cliff and toward the sea. It then circled to attain a height\nof 50 meters. The engine was running at its normal operating speed\nand, having reached 50 meters, it was again pointed out to sea.\nMeanwhile, the pilot attempted to maintain a horizontal trajectory.\nBefore arriving at the edge ofthe cliff, the controls were locked\nand the accelerograph\'s recording cylinder started up. The resulting record shows that at this moment (figure 4;07, part a) the airplane was located in the turbulence existing behind the ascending\nzone and underwent accelerations of 2 m/sect.\nUrn arriving in the ascending zone, the acceleration reached\n3 m/sec (figure 407, part b). The airplane reared slightly and\nperformed a series of oscillatons due to the irregularities in the\nwind. The average valui of its oscs.11ations remained positive and\nwas equal of 1.25 m/sec . The vehicle rose by 50 meters under\nthese conditions while continuing out to sea. Toward the end of\nthe ascent, the acceleration weakened. At this point, the pilot\nopened the throttle a little more so as not to lose altitude, and\nmade a horizontal U-turn. Then he cut off the gasoline and followed\na straight trajectory parallel to the cliff in the zone of propitious updrafts.\nThe ariplane did not lose any height during this entire period.\nDuring the part of the flight with the motor cut off, the airplane, whose controls were also locked, received a series of\naccelerations. They were sometimes positive, sometimes negative, and\nvaried between 1 and 2 m/sec . They were caused by the airplane\'s\nencounter with gusts and eddies.\nLastly, the airplane\'s speed in this experiment was about\n120 km/h during the horizontal powered part of the flight. It fell\nto about 50 km/h after the motor was shut off.\nThe Influence of a Terrestrial Wind\n\nWe tried to complete the findings we obtained at Vauville while\ninvestigating the inertial forces acting on an airplane flying\nthrough atmospheric disturbances by recording the forces on a\nflight from Barcelona to Toulouse. This route was chosen from\t\n/268\namong those of commerical lines because it seemed that the greatest\natmospheric disturbances were encountered there..\nOur accelerograph was placed in .a -Latdc.otm Aix-lines , f .urseater Farman Limousine airplane powered by a 12-cylinder 300 hp\nRenault engine. The instrument was positioned so as to detect the\nacceleration normal to the wing plane.\nTracings 1 and 2 in figure 408 represent the start of the\nflight, before and after passing over Barcelona. The weather was\ncalm, and the acceleration almost zero.\n\n370\n\nTracing 3 was started near the mountainous zone. It first\nshows jolts of increasing intensity due to a wind blowing from the\nNW. This is followed by a less agitated se\xe2\x82\xac:tion.\nTracing 4 corresponds to the entrance of the mountainous\nzone at an altitude of 2,300 meters. The jolts were fairly strong,\nwith the wind rising.\nTracing 5 records the flight through the Pertus Pass, whose\naltitude is about 400 meters. As it entered , the pass, the airplane\ndescended from 1,200 meters to about 600 under the effect of atmospheric disturbances and downdrafts. This was done without any voluntary maneuver by the pilot.\nThe pass w as entered at a height of 200 meters above the ground.\nThe most violent shaking ocurred at this time. Positive\naccelerations as high as 10 m/sec , In addition to gravity are found\n\nIn..-tracing 5, though it is t ue that-these-.are ex--optional. In -the\n\nopposite direc:i.on, the acceleration barely exceeded 5 m/sec2.\nThe airplane\'s wings therefore underwent a stress ranging from\n.5 to 2 times its weight. In addition, the jolts followed each\nother at intervals of 4 to 5 seconds. It must be pointed out that\nthe average duration of the atmospheric disturbances causing the\njolts would be much longer for an observer on the ground. It would\nbe multiplied by the ratio of the airplane\'s speed to that of the\nwind, which in this case is a number close to three. The airplane\'s\nairspeed at an engine speed of 1,350 to 1,400 rpm, at which the\nvoyage was made, was in the vicinity of 40 m/sec. The wind\'s speed\nwas on the order of 15 m/sec. The gusts therefore lasted 10 or 15\nseconds. This corresponds to what we have found in other situations\nwith our anemometers.\nThe magnitude of the strongest accelerations imparted by the\natmospheric disturbances during the flight, in^addition \'to gravity,\nranged from -b to +10 m/sec .\nWe should note here that, in the pilot\'s opinion, the air was\nrelatively calm for the season. The pilot claims that the shaking\nis twice as great during heavy winter weather. This indicates the\npossibility that the acceleration can impose loads on the airplane\nequal to three times its weight.\nIII. Comparison of Magnitude of Acceleration According to Flight\nCharacteristics\nAn examination of all the acceleration curves we obtained\nduring our test flights have given us the values on pages 373-4 for\nacceleration during various maneuvers, as well as the corresponding\njoystick movements.\n\n371\n\n1.

In addition, the accelerograph is\nattached so as either to be vertical during horizontal flight or\nhave an incidence on the order of 3\xc2\xb0. Theinstrument\'s axis\ntherefore deviates from the normal by ten decrees at most. The\nresult of this is that the projection of the normal acceleration\nonto the accelerograph\'s axis differs from its value by at most\n0\n\n/270\n\n1 1/2%. They consequently differ by a quantity that is in\n\ngeneral less than the probably uncertainty in the measurements.\nMax.

This means that at that moment the airplane\nsupports 6 1/2 times its own weight. This figure is not in disagreement with the maximum value of 7.8 g obtained by the Americans with\nanother model airplane and other pilots. In addition, let it be\npointed out that the figures we found in the course of acrobatic\nmaneuvers should not be considered as absolute maxima. First of all,\n-the atmospheric disturbances occurring during a maneuver certainly\naugment: them, as we have seen. Next, do not forget that the airplane\'s frame also undergoes vibrations originating in the engine.\nThey can give rise to considerable supplementary stresses. During\nour experiments, the accelerograph was dampened sous to eliminate\nthe vibrations it was not intended to study. It recorded only the\nresultant of accelerations due to aerodynamic forces. It would be\n.interesting to know something about these vibratory stresses, which\nare very fatiguing for the metal.\nIV. Measurement of Frame Deformation in an Airplane in Flight\nAll the stresses that we detected in the course of maneuvers\nor lon the middle of strong gusts have an incontrovertible effect on\nairo:i ^Ze frames. There is thus an interest in discovering the\ndeformations that can result from such supplementary forces.\n\nI\n\n37 4\n\n/271\n\n.rr.^.^..........\n\nFurthermore, measurement of deformation is another way of\ndetermining the aerodynamic stresses undergone by an airplane\'s\n\nwings during flight.\nDe scription of the H.M.P. wing Stress Indicator\nAlong with Huguenard and Planiol, I created a wing stress\nindicator for this purpose. The device includes a sort of lightweight antenna fixed to an airfoil or in the interior of the thick\npart of the wing. This is done in such a manner that it is possible\nto consider it as fixed and indeformable under flight conditions.\nThe antenna constitutes a reference line for measuring deformations\nof the wing spar.\n\nx.\n\nFigure 409\nwing Stress Indicator with Liquid Transmission\nRight: Schematic Diagram; Middle: Transmitter; Left: Receiver\n\t\nR) Receiver\nKey: B) Push rod\n\t\nE) Recording cylinder\nT) Transmitter\'\nC) Tubing\n\nThe measuring unit is a liquid comparator composed of a\ntransmitter T, a receiver R, and tubing C (figure 409).\nThe transmitter includes-a base attached, for example, to the\nwing spar. One end of a lever is connected to the base by a joint\nand the other is fastened to a fixed frame member, brace, or exterior\npole. A deformation of the wing results in an angular movement by\nthe lever. The lever \' s movement affects two variable reservoirs.\nThe reservoirs are mounted in opposition to one another such that\nthe volume of one increases as the other decreases. \t\n\n375\n\n272\n\nA deformation of the wing therefore has the effect of forcing\nthe liquid into one tube and sucking it from the other. A deformation in the opposite direction produces the reverse movement\nof liquid in the tubes.\nThe receiver is made of a base on which are mounted two\nreservoirs similar to those of the transmitter. Each of them is\nconnected to one of the above-mentioned tubes. However, the preceding control lever is replaced by a pen which can either inscribe\na curve on a recording cylinder or move in front of a dial.\nThe movements of the liquid engendered by the wing\'s deformations have the result of displacing the pen by an amount proportional to the deformation undergone by the wing.\nThe variable reservoirs in the transmitter and the receiver\nare made up of manometric tubes of approximately elliptical cross\nsection. Each is rolled into a semi-circle. The transmitter is\ndepicted in the middle section of figure 409. It includes two tubes\narranged in opposite directions. They are welded to two different\nblocks which also hold the fittings on the ends of the transmission\ntubing. At their free end., the two tubes are connected by a\nflexible steel sheet to the middle of which the control lever is\njointed. The lever is also jointed by another flexible sheet to\nthe common base.\nThe receiver, arranged for recording with pen and ink or lamp\nblack, includes two -manometric tubes similar to the transmitter\'s.\nAs indicated on the right of figure 409, they are arranged about a\ncommon block connecting to the two lines feeding them.\nHuguenard- M agnan Electrical Indicator\n\nHuguenard and I designed another type of wing stress indicator\nhaving electrical transmission instead of liquid.\nThe apparatus includes a transmitter and a receiver which can\nbe similar, lines linking the two units, a capacitor, and the alternator for supplying current to the device.\nThe transmitter and receiver are each made up of a stator\nhaving at least two poles and a rotor wound like the armature of a\ndirect current motor. Both rotors have two contacts 180 0 apart\nlocated on laminated iron cores, as do the stators, moreover.\n\'r\t\n\nThe schematic diagram in figure 410 indicates how the units\nare set up. AA and AA\' represent the transmitter and receiver stator\nwindings through wht,h a current creating an alternating flux passes.\nThe transmitter rotor B is connected by two contacts to the\ncontacts on receiver rotor B\'. A capacitor D of suitable strength\nshunts the wiring. An alternator of moderate frequency simultaneously\nfeeds both stators.\n\n376\n.00 000\n\nRotor B is connected to a\nfixed post Co whereas the stator\nis held by the wing spar whose\ndeformatioi 1 in relation to the\nfixed post is supposed to be\nmeasured.\n\ntta \xe2\x99\xa6 -\n\n!1lftrx\t\n\nt\n\nrr r trt!}\nYi N^j,i\t\nt\n}\n`r\n\nV\nE\n\ny\n\n,\nV!\n\nFigure 410\nSchematic Diagram of HuguenardMagnan Elecgrical Remote Motion\nTransmitter\nKey: B, B\' Rotors\nAA, AA\': Stator Windings\nD: Capacitor\n\nRotor B\' supports either an\nindicating needle C\', a recording\nneedle, or a mirror for photographic recording.\nThe circuit constants are\nchosen so that the circuit \' including the two rotors and the capacitor is synchronized with the\ncurrent produced by the alternator\nwhen it is turning at its normal\nrate. In these circumstances,\nfor each rotor position B, rotor\nB\' has only one equilibrium position. This is the one for which\nthe current is zero in the rotor\nand capacitor circuit. If rotor\nB\' is moved from its equilibrium\nposition, it returns to it immediately.\n\nIf, on the other hand, a deformation of the wing spar alters\ntransmitter rotor B \' s position, a current arises in the rotor circuit\nand displaces B\' up to the point that the current is cancelled out\nby the displacement.\nThe instrument presents the following advantages:\n1) The apparatus does not contain any spring. Its zero point\nis absolutely i nvariable whatever the electromotive force produced\nby the alternator the current \' s frequency, and the resistance of the\nwiring.\n2) Its scale is also independent of these variables, and also\nof atmo s pheric conditons.\n3) It is easy to drive several receivers with the same transmitter, if desired.\n4) It. is possible to establish in advance an amplification or\nreduction factor between the angles through which the transmitter\nand receiver rotors turn.\n\nt\t\n\n5) The power consumption of such an indicator is very small.\nA radio or lighting alternator can drive several without affecting\nits normal role.\nSuch an instrument is also attractive because it provides a\na\n\n377\n\n/273\n\nroduction of r tational motion, whether\nway o make long distance rep\norYnot it has aconstant,drection or angnlar ; spee\'d. The receiver\nunit exactly repeats the movements of the transmitter unit or even\namplifies or reduces them by a factor chosen at will during construe-`\ntion The amplitude could be either a certain number of revolutions\nor merely a fractionrof one revolution. Because of this, the instrument could have a great number of applications in numerous fields,\neven outside of aviation.\nAirborne Tests\nWe sought to make direct measurements of the deformation undergone by an airplane wing in flight. However, the only airplane\navailable to us was f l.e Gourdou, which was not built with such a\npurpose in mind. It was impossible to _lodge the entire device\ninside the wing., We had to place a carefully streamlined 1.20 m\nlong pole below the wing. Very rigid steel fittings held the pole\n110 mm from the lower side of the wing plane and near the leading\nedge. The comparator usedwas fastened to the forward wing spar. It\nwas wired to a receiver whose pen inscribed on the accelerograph\'s\ncylinder.: ;A tie rod connected the comparator tothe streamlined pole\n\nin relation ,t\'o which the wing` spar deformations occurring in flight\n\nwere supposed to be measured.\nThe pole\'s flexibility was first of all investigated by suspending weights fromihepoint where the indicator control rod was to\nbe attached. The pole-transmitter system was thus deformed and the\namount of deformation measured by the displacement of the receiver\nneedle, the amplification factor having been determined before hand.\nA graph of deformation as a function of load could thus be\ntraced.\ncarried out some experiments at Vi llacoublay by:,,\nWe\t\nusing the first devicedescribed.\t We attached a transmitter to\nthe left forward wing spar of a-180 hp Gourdou-Leseurre .airplane\nand connected it to a receiver that inscribed its displacements,\nwith an amplification factor of about 30, on the same cylinder as\nthe accelerograph and air speed indicator were using.\nFigure 411 shows the tracings of deformation, acceleration,\nand speed shifted so that their median parts . ,concur.\t Since the\nordinates are not linear, the concurrence has not been verified outside the level for which the phase difference has been suppressed.\nThe close r6sembla n ce bet w een\nelerograph and wing stress\nindicator tracingscan be seen\n\t\n\t This is completely\nnatural.\t It is obvious that if the acceleration normal to the wings\ngrows, the stress on the wing spars normal to the wing plane grows\nby the same proportion because this acceleration is due to the increase in lift supplied by the airfoils.\nDo not search too far for apparent coincidences between the two\nwing tracings.\t There are, in fact, s\xc2\xb0veral phenomena that intro-\n\nx\n/274\n\nf-\n\n.\nx\n\n3 7 8\t\n\n^^\'\t ,,.\t\n\n^\'_\n\n.f\n\nduce fairly appreciable differences in the results. First of all,\nthe acceleration is recorded close to the center of gravity and the\ndeformations are those of a single longeron in its section furthest\nfrom the center of gravity- It follows that each time an acrobatic\nstunt is not performed in a vertical plane containinq the airplane\'s\nplane of symmetry, the work imposed on the two wings is not the same.\nThus, when the airplane rotates about an axis parallel to its translational veloc.ity, only measurement of the deformation of both wings\ncan indicate the acceleration undergone by the center of gravity.\n\n39\t\n\nVi\n\n\t\n00000\nOr\n\ns^\t\n5ser 10\t\n\n.0\t\n\n30\t\n\n4U\t\n\n50\t\n\n00\t\n\n70\n\nFigure 411\nSimultaneous Recordings of Wing Spar Deformation D, Acceleration\nNormal to the Wings A, and Air Speed V of a Gourdou-Leseurre\nAirplane in the Course of Various Maneuvers\nL, Loop; R, Pull-Out; R t , Renversement; V 1 , Vertical Rank\n(Pilot: Joublin)\nLastly, the necessity of mounting an exterior pole close to the\nwing introduces another cause of deformation in t;ie tracing of the\nwing stress indicator. During flight, the proximity of the pole and\nwing gives rise to an interaction between these two bodies. The\nresult is that as the speed varies, the bending of the pole also\nvaries, all other conditions remaining the same. We were able to\ndiscover the effect of the pole\'s aerodynamic deformation by using\nthe tracing of speed. Our idea was that the quantity to be considered was not speed, but the air current\'s kinetic pressure. Now,\nthe Venturi tube\'s amplification factor varies little, and the\nmanometer readings are basi.. \xe2\x80\xa2 slly proportional to the reduction in\npressure. Thanks to this, \'t caa be assumed that the ordinates in\nmillimeters of the speed curve provide a sufficiently accurate\nmeasure of the kinetic pressure reduction. It therefore suffices\nto consider the points where the accelerograph\'s tracing indicates\na lift. equal to weight and to measure point by point the corresponding\nordinates of the speed and wing deformation curves. A relationship\nbetween the variations of speed and deformation can then be derived\nfrom this body of measurements.\n\n379\n\nWe have done this work, but will not give any more details on\nit here.\nIt has enabled us to see, for example, that in the region of\nthe tracing corresponding to a loop followed by a dive, the measurements reveal a real wing spar deformation of 1.1 mm, showing that\nthis deformation corresponds to an acceleration of 2.7 g. Now, when\t\nmeasuring the acceleration at the corresponding points on the accelerograph tracing, we found a difference of 2.6 g, proving that the\nextent to which the results agreed should be considered satisfactory.\nOur method, contrary to those of accelerometers, makes possible\na constant surveillance of wing behavior. it also allows wing\nfatigue and aging to be detected. While the accelerometer can tell\na pilot that a certain maneuver exposes his airplane to fatigues\nmore or less c1cie to the acceptable limit, nothing announces to him\nthe immediate approach of a rupture. In contrast, such a warning\ncan be obtained from the direct measurement of stress by means of\nevaluating wing spar deformation.\nThe deformation of any part of the wing frame can be measured\nin the same way by adapting the shape of the armature to the component to be studied. This was demonstrared to us by Huguenard and\nPlaniol.\nif, for example, one desires to study the bending of $ frame\nrib between two support points, one attaches a light, rigid brace\nto the two support points in such a way that it does not contribute\nto the stress supported by the rib, The b:?:ace is therefore fastened\nto the support points just enough so as not to fall off cr be deformed by a variation in their distance. In these circumstances,\nthe brace\'s shape and dimensions remain constant during flight.\nTowards the middle of the rib, the deformable measurement junction\nis established. It is connected on one side to the rib and on the\nother to the brace. It is thus possible to measure the displacement:\nof the middle or any other paint of the rib, or even or a neighboring rib, relative to the straight line joining the points of support.\nThe same setup also can be applied without alteration to the\nmeasurement and surveillance of strain in a particular aircraft part,\nsuch as a stay.\nFor this purpose, a light brace acting as a dummy stay is\ninstalled parallel, to the real stay. It is attached at one of its\nends to the corresponding end of the stay under study. The rest of\nits length is left free except that its other end is linked to the\nfree end of the main stay by the deformable junction.\nAny difference in strain in the stay and dummy stay is transformed into a relative displacement of their free ends and, consequently, into a deformation of the measurement junction. The deformation\ncan be left as a function of the load on the stay and the temperature\nor made r function of the load only. In the-latter case all that has\n\n380\n\nI\n\n275\n\n110 ION 11,101 11\n\nto be done is to build the dummy stay out of a substances_ with the\nsame coefficient of expansioA as the stay and to make the two components the same length. The deformation of the elastic junction can\nthen be used to measure the stay\'s mechanical deformation.\nThe unit designated as the elastic or deformable measurement\njunction can also be adapted to a system enabling the pilot to have\na knowledge of the deformation of his airplane\'s frame by reading it\noff a graduated scale. Alternatively, it could be used to set off\na luminous or acoustic alarm to warn him when the deformation has\nreached a level endangering the safety of the airplane.\nIt is obvious that such devices are particularly adept at\nwatching for permanent deformation or aging of airplane frames. They\ncan also be used with similar mountings adapted to each particular\ncase to check on tho bending, strain, compression, twisting, or,\nin general, all the elastic or permanent deformations of an assembly\nduring its work.\npilots of transports do not perform acrobatic\nOf course, \t\nstunts and in theory execute only normal., straight flights in which\nacceleration does not exceed l g and the frame deformation is small.\nHowever, it can happen that damage to-the engine or rudder or shift/276\ning of their load forces them to dive and then abruptly level off.\t\nAs a result of this, and also often because of strong gusts of\nwind, their vehicles can undergo stresses close to those arising from\nacrobatic stunts. There is thus a need to gain a knowledge of such\nstresses for the construction of transports. It is of course universally understood that for such airplanes, as for fighters, the measurements made on one vehicle are not applicable to another of different\nshape, power or guidance system.\n\t\nV. Mea \t\n^.n\nan A\n\nnt of Vertical, Tang ential, and Transverse Acceleration.\n\ne\n\nIn all the preceding studies, only investigation of vertical\nacceleration was considered. There is also reason to determine\nthe value of horizontal and transverse acceleration during certain\nmaneuvers, e.g., flat spin. With this in mind, we built a threedimensional accelerograph which will soon be tested out. Our instrument is comprised of four accelerometric tubes:\n1) Two horizontal placed perpendicular to the axis of the\nfuselage, one at the tip of each wing.\n2) One vertical situated near the center of gravity.\n3) One horizontal and parallel to the axis of the fuselage,\npositioned in the tail section, for example.\nThe readings of the four accelerographs are inscribed simultaneously on the same recording cylinder at the same time as those\nof an air speed indicator, densigraph, and revolution counter.\n\n381\niw\t\n\n\t\n\nEach accelerograph includes a mercury reservoir like the\npresent type. However, the reservoir has a 1 cm cross section\nand is 1 meter long in the wings and 1.50 meters long in the tail.\nOnly the vertical apparatus retains the specifications already\ndescribed.\nThe transmission of pressure due to acceleration is accomplished by small diameter steel tubes completely filled with a\nglycerine solution. Each tube is accompanied by a compensator tube\nwhich is parallel to it and whose other end opens onto a mercuryfilled vessel. In this way, the columns of water are more or less\nin equilibrium and the manometers record only the pressures due to\nthe acceleration acting on the mercury in the various tubes.\n\nn\n\n_ _\t\n\nv\nIt\n\nFigure 412\nArrangement of Instruments for Studying Airplane Stress\nA, Accelerometric Tubes; B, Venturi Tube for Speed; C, Hot Wire;\nD, Densigraph; E, Wing Stress Indicator, with Single\nRecording Cylinder\nThe intrinsic period of the various instruments is about 1/5\nsecond.\nThe four manometers are fixed along a recording cylinder along\nwith such systems as those for recording speed, horizontal rudder\nmovement, direction, and banking. \t\n(See figure 412).\nThe recording cylinder that was installed has a length of\n30 cm and a diameter of 15 cm.\nVI. Measurement of an Air p lane\'s Air S p eed at All Altitudes\nAll the experiments that we carried out have been done in\nthe vicinity of the ground, at less than 1,000 meters up. It\nmight be necessary to know the exact speed of an airplane at any\ngiven height.\n\n382\n\nANFAW .\n\n/277\n\nThe pressure reduction sppplied by the Venturi at a speed V\n\nis of the form p a d \xe2\x80\xa2 f(v), where d is the air density at the\npoint under consideration. This density can only be found by\nmeasuring the conditions on the ground: H and 0 0 , and by applying\nto them the standard laws of decrease in R and a as a function of\naltitude Z which is recorded at the moment of measurement by a\nbarograph. In these circumstances, serious errors might occur at\nhigh altitude.\nTo convince oneself of this, remember that an error of 100\nmeters in altitude corresponds to an error of a little more than\n18 in atmospheric density. We know, from experiments we have done,\nthat the amount of altitude lost when making a loop is on the order\nof 100 meters, whereas an airplane will lose more than 500 meters\nin 10 seconds during a very steep dive.\nThe desirability of a speed recording device whose readings\nare independent of atmospheric density is thus plain to all. This\nis why we sought to develop a compensating apparatus.\n\nOur compensating anemometric speed indicator is based on the\nnew principle described in the course of the second lesson, and used\nin the construction of Sylphon capsules, barographs, and densigraphs,\nwhose designs are reproduced above.\nThe Huguenard, Magnan, Planiol Compensating Air Speed Indicator\nThis instrument is based on the use of a Venturi tube amplifying,\nthe kinetic pressure reduction created by the airplane\'s relative\nspeed.\nIn the absence of any experimental data on the functioning of\nVenturi tubes in conditions of changing temperature and pressure,\nwe assumed that the tube\'s amplification factor, the ratio of the\npressure reduction produced by the tube to the difference between\nthe air current\'s dynamic and static pressures, depended only on\nthe speed.\nThis hypothesis, which basically consists of supposiong that\n\ndensity and the distribution of speeds inside the tube are independent,\nis not at all illogical despite its simplicity. It constitutes a\nfirst approximation that is probably close enough to reality.\nUnder these conditions, the pressure reduction has the form\nh = Pf(v)/T, where v is the speed, P and T the absolute pressure\nand temperature of the ambiant air, and h o = Pof(v)/To , the equation\nfor the Venturi tube calibration curve at ground level. To have a\ncompensating apparatus, the angle a by which the instrument\'s\nindicating needle is deflected has to be independent of variations\nin P and T.\n\n383\n\n\t\n\nIf one puts together an apparatus in such a way that the angle \t\na is proportional to the pressure reduction h at -onstant temperature\nand pressure, the relationship a = KTh/P, in which K is a constant\ncharacteristic of the apparatus, is a necessary and sufficient\ncondition for obtaining the desired result.\nSince h = Pf(v)/T, one then has a = Kf(v).\nIn these circumstances, the apparatus\'s readings, defined by\nthe angle a, now depend only on the speed v to be measured and\nthe function f(v) can be determined through calibration in a wind\ntunnel. The compensation is obtained in the following fashion.\nA closed housing contains all\nthe mechanical parts for the apparatus.\nIt is maintained at the ambiant temperature and static pressure by a\nsuitably arranged circulation of air.\n\nr__\t\nx . 77 \t\n\nThe pressure reduction produced\nby the Venturi tube is exerted inside\nthe housing by a very elastic and\n\nS\t\n\n-- --\' - Q`\ni\'\t\n\nA . 6\t\n\na\t\n\n\t\n\nf^,\t\n\nk\t\n\nc. ;: _ .= r\n\nS\t\n\nflexible cell C2.\t (See figure 413.)\nThe cell is attached at end D to the\n\nhousing C.

The relative error due to this\ncause is therefore independent of the range of measurements.\n\n/_\n\nIt can be concluded from these findings that the amount of\nerror intrinsic to the apparatus as far as imperfections in its\nfunctioning go is of the order of 1/2%. This error corresponds not\nto the measurement of air speed, but to the pressure reduction produced by the Venturi tube. Errors in compensation naturally are\nadded on to this.\nr imental Study of the Influence of Temperature on_Elas\nThe apparatus was tried out with a restoring force made,up\nsolely of the elastic tension due to the springs. At an ambient\ntemperature of 21 0 , this was equal to 10.8 kg and gave the instrument its normal sensitivity corresponding town angular deflection\nof the lever by about .095 radians 5or a pressure reduction in the\nmeasuring bellows equal to .5 kg/cm .\nThe elimination of corrections due to the air contained in\nthe restoring bellows is obtained immediately by letting it be\nopen to the surrounding atmosphere.\nExperiments were performed at temperatures of 21 0 and 810.\nThey included ten series of measurements made equally during ascent\nand descent. We were thus able to establish the hysteresis cycles\nat these two temperatures.\nIt can be seen in figure 417 that the hysteresis cycles\nexhibit appreciably the same thickness, about 1/2 mm. This is\nsimilar to that obtained at other adjustments and corresponds to a\nrelative error of 1% since the total deflection is about 60 mm.\nExamination of the cycles\' median curves, which are the\ncalibration curves for the apparatus at the temperature indicated,\nwill reveal that for any deflection; of the needle, the separation\nbetween the two curves is basically proportional to the deflection\nunder consideration and is very close to three hundredths of it.\n\n387\n\n^!f\n\na\n\ni\n1\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\x9e\t\n\nFigure 417\nDetermination of the Influence\nof Tempe r hire on the Compen-\n\nsatin:; Sl:eed Indicator\n\nFigure 418\nH.M.P. Compensating Speed\nIndicator\n\nKey: a) Deviation in millimeters\n\nb) Deflection of needle in :nm\n\nThus, when the temperature rises by 60\xc2\xb0, t:ie measurement furrished by the apparatus increases by 3% of its value.\nOne can see that for variations of \xc2\xb120 0 , which were considered\nabove as the practical limits of the deviation of real temperature\nfrom standard, the error would amount to 18.\nIt is therefore clearly inferior to that arising from imperfect\ncompensation by means of air filling the restoring cell for an apparatus adjusted for 5,000 meters. This latter error is about -2%.\nOn the contrary, when the instrument is adjusted For 3,000\nmeters, the two errors are of the same order.\nHowever, it is essential to point out that beyond the random\nvariations of \xc2\xb120\xc2\xb0, the apparatus is also exposed to the standard\ndecrease in temperature with altitude, which is approximately 40\xc2\xb0\nat an altitude of 6,000 meters.\nThe experiments made withthe apparatus were completed by a\nmodification designed to make it insensitive to vibrations and\nvariations in the magnitude and direction of the average acceleration\nto which it is exposed.\n\nfix\t\n\n388\t\n\n\' A.\n\'q;1\\ .\n\n1.\n\nNA GS;\n\nQ VA\n\n/281\n\nThe tests have shown that a suitable balancing makes it\npossible tc beep changes in needle below 02 mm for six different\npositions of the apparatus.\nThe error due to a variation of fg in the acceleration is\ntherefore only 10.1 mm, or less than 0.21 of the total reading.\nFurthermore, it was found desirable to considerably lengthen\nthe apparatus\'s intrinsic period of vibration. Under current\nconditions it is about 1/30 second and threatens to result in a\nresonance with the engine vibrations, whose period is similar.\nBalancing and slowing of the intrinsic motion can be obtained\nwithout any difficulty by attaching tothe needle axis a part with a\nhigh moment of inertia and possessing an off- center piece adjustable\nin terms of both radius and azimuth. Such a part can be easily fitted\n\ninside the housing of the apparatus.\nConctruction of the Actual Indicator\nAs can be seen in figure 418, the apparatus is made of a cast\naluminum housing closed by two plates of the same material.\nThe housing contains the supports for the knife-edges attached\nby strong screws to special exterior tabs. The supports are made\nof treated forged steel, as are the knife-edges.\nContrary to the schematic diagram in figure 413, upon which \t\nthe theory of the apparatus is based, the measurement bellows C2\ndoes not act directly on the mobile lever restored by the bellows Cl\nand the springs.\nThe arrangement actually constructed, which gives the same\nresults, reduces the instrument\'s bulk and gives the mobile lever\na much more convenient form. It consists of making the bellows C2\nact through an intermediate lever that amplifies the deformation\nthree times. This allows a very great reduction in total size and\ntherefore in weight.\nNote that the entire system formed by the two bellows, the\nright-angle lever, and the intermediate lever includes no frictionproducing joint. it contains solely knife-edges-and very weak\nsprings.\nOn the contrary, the needle and its amplifying system, which\nare not exposed to any stress, are mounted on pivots.\nThe amplification realized can be adjusted at will by moving\nthe push-rod linking the extension of the right-angle lever to the\nlever directing the needle.\n\n389\n\n/282\n\nRECOMMENDED READING\nHuguenard, Magnan, Planiol, L\'accdldr ra he H.M.P.: son applicat\na la mesure des accdl6rations en vol[The H.M.P.

Much\ntheoretical work has been carried out on this subject and it can be\nsaid that as a whole the authors have not arrived at satisfactory\nsolutions to the problem.\nFor these reasons, experimental, studies have moved ahead of\ntheoretical ones during the last several years. However, while they\nhave yielded some interesting findings, they have rapidly proved how\ndifficult such research is to perform. This is why, even at the\npresent time, it cannot be claimed that the experimental findings\nsurpass the theoretical results by a great deal.\nWe have already seen that the projection of the general resultant R of aerodynamic forces on the direction of relative velocity is\ncalled drag, R., and that the projection of R perpendicular tothe\nrelative velocity is called lift, Rz.\nThe force R is well defined if in addition to the strength\nof the two components, its moment M relative to a certain point on\nthe plain of symmetry a.s known.\nWhat is more, the orientation of a moving body in relation\nto its relative velocity is given by the angle formed by the velocity\nand a lubber line contained in the solid\'s plane of symmetry. This\nis the angle of incidence or attack, i.\nIn order to determine experimentally the components Rx and Rz,\none can directly measure the forces resulting from the body\'s or,\nin the present case, the airplane\'s displacement in the air.\nI. Methods for Studying Airplanes on the Ground\nNumerous methods were conceived for this purpose at the beginning of aviation.\nFirst there were the experiments performed with circular\ncourses, like those of Marey, Lilienthal, and Hiram-Maxim. They\nset up large turning devices from which they suspended a large\nsized airplane, like that of Deutsch de la Meurthe at Saint-Cyr.\nMuch work was carried out with these devices, but the least that\none can say is that the circular track method gives rise to very\ncomplex turbulent phenomena in the air. This makes it impossible\nto consider the movement, of an airplane fixed to the end of an arm\nas identical to rectilinear displacement.\nThe Saint-Cyr trolley allowed tests of full-scale assemblies\nto be carried nut. Six meters long and 2 meters wide, the trolley\nmoved freely over a straight electrified track close to 1,400 meters\nlong.\n\n391\n\n12831\n\n/284\nThe speed attained during\nthe tests as recorded with the\naid of a Richard tachometer which\n\xe2\x80\x94\t\nmeasured the rotational speed of\nan axis placed between the axles\nof the machines supplying motive\npower. A wing was mounted on the\ntrolley (figure 419) and the\neffect of the air on it was\nmeasured by a hydraulic dynamometer whose pressure was transmitted to instruments of the\nFigure 419\nBourdon type. Unfortunately, the\nThe Saint-Cyr Tiol ley\t\neffect of the air on the surfaces\nunder study was influenced by the\npresence of the trolley and the interactions between the wing, the\ntrolley, and the ground could not be calculated. The results obtained were thus held to be fairly random.\nII. Studies of Small-Scale Models\nFor these reasons, tests of full-scale assemblies were abandoned before the war. Researchers turned to wind tunnels, which,\nalthough they were only capable of indirect experiments, possessed\nsome indisputable conveniences for runnit.g tests. however, the\nresults were probably not any more accurate, as we are going to see.\nThe first advantage the experimenters enjoyed by \t\ning wind\ntunnels was that they could substitute small-scale models for\nlife-size aircraft. Such models could be placed right before one\'s\neyes, in a regular enough air current.\nWind Tannels\n\n4\nFigure 420\nWind Tunnel Types\n1, Aspiration without Recol-ary; 2, Exhaust without\n3, Closed Circuit; 4, Eiffel Type\n\n392\n\nThe first constructors of wind tunnels created installations\nmade up of only intake and exhaust fans (figures 420-1 and 420-2).\nThose who followed, desirous of having more rapid air currents of\nfairly large cross sectional area at their disposal, qu. i ckly thought\nof returning the air leaving the tunnel to the far and of circulating\nthis air in a closed circuit. This would reduce the required energy\nto that needed to overcome passive resistance. The wind tunnel\ndesigned by Prandlt at Gottingen represents one type of closed\n\ncircuit wind tunnel (figure 42( \') \t\n\nHowever, it has a serious\n\ninconvenience. The air in the tunnel heats up in such a way that\nit is indispensable to add a device for keeping the adjustment of\nthe instruments stable.\nAnother wind tunnel system was invented by Eiffel. It consists of sending the air stream leaving the test chamber through a\ndivergent diffuser. Since Eiffel\'s wind tunnel has served as the\nmodel for the majority of modern laboratories, this is the one that\nwe are going to examine in detail.\n\nC\t\n\n^^ \xe2\x96\xba5-1`n1`l^ 1y^ c\n\nh:\t\n\n1)\n\n\t\n\nFigure 421\nLongitudinal Cross Section\nof Eiffel Wind Tunnel\n\n1\n\nFigure 422\nLongitudinal Cross\nSection of the Large\nWind Tunnel at Issyles-Moulineaux\n\nKey: C) Collector\nE) Test Chamber\nD) Diffuser\nA fan, i.e. a special propellor, sucks the air located in\na large, closed room and pushes it into a collector shaped like a\ntruncated cone (figure 421). The air current at this point takes\non a greater speed, while its pressure diminishes.\nThe ai.r next arrives in a perfectly air-tight room entered by\ndouble doors. This is where the measurements are made and where\nthe current\'s static pressure prevails. The air current then\npasses through a truncated cone-shaped diffuser, which is the\ninverse of the collector, but longer. There, it iL compressed at\nthe same time as it slows down. This reduces the work of the compressor. Finally, the air goes back to the large room and returns\nto the collector.\n\n393\n\n/285\n\nThe diameter of the air current in the Eiffel wind tunnel is\n2 meters and its speed is 30 m / sec. The power necessary to achieve\nthis is 50 hp.\nSince then, other wind tunnels similar to Eiffel\'s have been\nbuilt in France. One of them is at the Institut Adrotechnique de\nSaint-Cyr [ Saint Cyr Aerotechnical Institute]. It has a diameter of\n2 meters and an air speed of 38 m/sec. The other is at Issy-lesMoulineaux. This one\'s diameter is 3 meters and its air speed is\n80 m/sec (figure 422).\nThe power required by \t\nthree tunnels, if the air was continuously renewed would be 70 ^.p, 270 hp and 3,000 hp. In fact,\nhowever, the same mass of air is indefinitely recirculated and the\nenergy necessary to compensate for the various losses and the imperfection of the fans is only 50 hp, 66 hp, and 1,000 hp respectively.\nThe Measurements\nThe models used inthe wind tunnels are theoretical reductions\nof the full-scale airplanes whose lift and drag are being investigated. The models are generally made of polished and varnished wood\nand are held stationary in the fluid by aerodynamic balances serving\nto measure the forces resulting from the action of the air.\nSome of the balances.-like Eiffel\'s, are rigid. The horizontal\nshaft, on which the mock-up is fixed in such a way that its major\naxis can assume various inclinations, is linked to a rigid vertical\nsupport ending in two knife-edges mounted in opposite directions.\nThe horizontal shaft can oscillate about them successively thanks to\nthe action of a cam.\nThe forces due to the two components of R are balanced by\nweights giving the forces\' average value. The values of Rz and\nRx are determined for various angles of attack. While one operator is doing the weighing, another checks the average value of the\nair current with an inclined water manometer connected to a Pitot\ntube placed in-the path of the air current. The magnitude of the\npressure is thus supplied and the speed can be calculated\nfrom it.\nAt Gottingen and Issy, wire balances are emplo^ 7ed. They hold\nthe model in the stream by means of less voluminous bodies than the\narms the Eiffel wind tunnel uses. At Issy, the components are\nmeasured by hydrostatic dynamometers attached to the wires and linked\nto metal diaphragm manometers whose readings can be inscribed on\na cylinder. The values of Cz and Cx can be derived from the values\nof Rz and Rx as a function of i obtained in this way. First, however,\nthe corrections necessitated by the supplementary resistance due\nto the supports themselves,.which has to be separated from that\nfelt by the stationary model, must be made.\n\nt\n394\n\nh\t\n\n}\nThe mock-up\'s polar curve is then traced. It is similar to\t\nthe curve reproduced in figure 423, which was obtained with a smallscale model of a Gourdou-Leseurre fighter airplane. Like the original,\nthe model had fabric-covered wings and fuselage, and stays.\nThese were set up to allow comparisons with the full-scale vehicle.\n\n/286\n\nSeveral criticisms of an\nexperimental order can be made\nof such measurement procedures.\nH 1 1\t\n\n1\n\n1\t\n\n1\t\n\n^\t\n\n1\n\ni\n\nFirst of all, the mock-ups\ngenerally are not complete reproductions of full-scale airplanes.\nRather than having wings covered\nwith fabric or corrugated steel\nand fuselages provided wittitheir\naccessory equipment, they are\nmade of wood. In addition, all\nthe poles and stays are usually\neliminated. The least that one\ncan say is that they are only very\nrOuyh copies of the original.\n\nFigure 423\nPolar Curve of a Model 180 tip\t\nGourdou-Leseurre Airplane \t\nobtained at the Issy-les- \t\n\t\nMoulineaux Wind Tunnel\n\nSecondly, the small-scale\nmodel is not isolated within the\nair stream. The supports or supporting wires not only have their\nown reaction, but they introduce\nperturbations and phenomena arising from their interaction with the\nmock-up. Such phenomena are very difficult to study and, most often,\nto calculate.\nFinally, the air current can be turbulent to a greater or\nlesser degree, depending on various factors: the form of the\ntunnel, and the interactivrnbetween the model and its support. Eddy\ncurrents are produced that sometimes have the effect of chanciing\nthe minimum values of C x for a single model by a factor of 2, as\nKarman demonstrated.\nFurthermore, air speed is most often read with a water manometer. It would be better to substitute for this somewhat arbitrary\nestimate direct measurement of speed using a manometric recording\napparatus like the one we used to determine the air speed of airplanes.\nSuch a procedure would be particularly attractive in wind\ntunnels in which measurement of aerodynamic forces can be done by\nrecording their instantaneous value. In addition, the variations\nin inclination or orientation, which always exist to a certain extent\nin air currents, are never investigated, even though their effect\nis important.\nA simple, double hot wire instrument would give one a recording\nof directional variations next to a simultaneous recording of the\ninstantaneous values of Rx, R Z , and speed.\n\n395\nt\n,^\t\n\nIt is true that attempts are made to diminish the amount of\nair turbulence by employing special partitions known as filters\nplaced in front of the testing chamber. However, since the magnitude of the remaining oscillations is unknown, the improvements brought\nabout by such devices are insufficient.\nIII. The Utilization of Wind Tunnel Measurements. The Laws of\nMechanical Sams,xtude\n\nThe findings thus obtained are not directly applicable to airplanes and the curves representing C , Cx, and Cm as a function of\ni are only characteristic of the solids geometrically similar to the\nmodel being studied under certain conditions.\nWe are now going to see how it is theoretically possible to\nderive from the values of the reaction force exerted by the\nair on one body the corresponding ones for another, similar body.\nWe will also see hes small-scale models are used to obtain figures\nfor the analogous full-scale vehicles.\nThe basis for doing this is the application of\'the principle of\nmechanical similitude concerning fluid resistance, as enunciated by\nNewton.\n\nAccording to the principle of mechanical similitude, it is\npossible to have two systems of values such that any element in\na material system S 1 measured with one group of units, can be compared to a similar element on a second system, S 2 , measured with a\nsecond group. The two are then said to be completely similar if\ntheir elements are in a one to one correspondence.\nWhat is more, it is possible to arbitrarily choose the\nratios a, T, and u of the fundamental units of length, time, and\nmass in the two systems of units. From this, it is correct to\nthink that there exists a similitude between the two elements, provided that the calculations of \\, T. and are in accord with the\nconditions resulting from their dimensions.\nThe Case of a Perfect Fluid\n\nLet us take the case of a,perfect, incompressible, weightless\nfluid at rest. A solid A moves through a fluid of density p and\nvelocity V. Another solid, A\', similar to A such that their lengths\ndiffer by a factor X, moves through a fluid of specific mass p\' with\na speed V\'. Mechanical similitude exists if the speeds created are\nsimilar and if the solids inihe neighborhood of A and A\' are also\nsimilar and similarly placed according tothe ratio R.\nOne can go from the first system to the second in the following\nfahion, without, moreover, getting involved in a question which is\nfar from being cleared up, for the laws of similitude might not have\nthe value customarily accorded to them.\n\n396\n\n/287\n\nIt is customarily assumed that the model and the body are, for\nexample, of the same material, as two birds or two fish of different\nsize would be. This implies that their weights are proportional to\ntheir volumes, and therefore that the acceleration due to gravity,\nLT- , has the same dimension in both cases.\nIf the ratio of lengths is designated by a and that of time\nand since acceleration, LT - -, is constant, a = T 2 , or\nThe speeds, of magnitude LT -1 , then differ by the factor\nand the masses, weights, or volumes by the factor a3.\nThis is because mass is transformed to weight by the acceleration,\nwhich has a ratio of 1,, and volume is derived from mass by way of\ndensity, which was assumed to be constant in the original hypothesis.\nby\n\nT,\nT = r.\nXT-1 = r,\n\nThe fluid resistance R opposing the body then depends only\non the fluid\'s density p, and the speed and linear dimensions of\nthe solid.\nLastly, the work performed (dimensions LMT -2 L) differs by a\nfa for of\t\n, and the power, i.e. the work divided by time\n(L MT -3 ) differs by a factor of X4T -1 = x3 r.\nThis is why it is customarily assumed that, because of these\nlaws, a 1/100 scale model airplane should be exposed during wind\ntunnel tests to an air current whose speed is ten times smaller\nthan that encountered by a real airplane if the air is of the same\ndensity.\nSimilarly, if one wants to fly the small model at a speed of\nV/10, with the airplane having a weight P and the model a weight\nP/100 2 , the ratio of power requi: red will be 3ice\' or 10. The\nmodel\'s engine will then have to be ten times weaker per kilogram\nof material than the airplane to be in accordance with the laws of\nmechanical similitude.\nNote that if the two ratios X and T are considered to be\nindependent, no comparison can be made between quantities of\ndifferent dimensions.\n-1\nSince speed has the dimensions LT\nand weight the dimensions\nMLT- 2 , like a force, if one wants to compare weight and flying\nspeed of an airplane and a model, is it necessary to consider the\nratio weight/speed, which is dimensionless in relation to length,\nand of dimension 1 in relation to mass and -1 in relation to time?\nAlternatively, should one deal with the ratio weight /speed 2 which\neliminates the time dimension, but is of dimension 1 in relation\nto mass and dimension -1 in relation to length?\nThe Case of a Real Fluid\n\nDespite these reservations, we shall assume the principle of\nmechanical similitude to hold, even though it is only valid for a\nperfect fluid. Air, however, has a weight, a viscosity, and a\ncompressibility. New conditions are needed for similitude to\ncontinue to exist.\n397\n\n/288\n\nSince the fluid has a weight, the ratio V 2 /Lq must have the\nsaem value f?r the two :odies, one full-scale, the other reduced.\nThe ratios V/Lq and V\' 2 /L\'g must therefore be equal. This is\nFroude\'s law.\nSince air has a viscosity, defined by the coefficient v, the\nratio VL /v, called the Reynolds number, must have the same value\nfor experiments in a wind tunnel as in the atmosphere, i.e.\nVL/v = V\'L\'/v\'.\n\nLastly, since the air also has a compressibility, the ratio\nV/C, where C is the speed of sound in the fluid under consideration,\nmust remain constant. Therefore, V/C = V\'/C\'. This is Bairstow\'s\nand Booth\'s law.\nThe ratio VL /v, the Reynolds number, plays an especially great\nrole in aerodynamic studies because several different modes of\nflow around certain solids are established or disappear according\nto its magnitude.\nIn order that the principle of mechanical similitude be\napplicable to a mock-up of an airplane, the same stable mode of flow\nmust exist for the two.\n\n,F\n\nFigure 424\t\nLongitudinal Cross Section\t\nof the American NACA Wind\t\nTunnel for Testing Full-\t\nScale Airplanes\nKey: C) Col\'ector\nE) Test chamber\nD) Diffuser\n\nFigure 425\nLongitudinal Cross Section\nof the Variable Density Wind\nTunnel of the American NACA.\n\nThe difficulty encountered in wind tunnels is precisely that\nof not being able to achieve values of VL/ ,,- close to reality except\nby increasing the speed or dimensions of the model, and therefore\nof the tunnel itself, or by decreasing V and increasing the air\ndensity in the experiment. This leads to creating wind tunnels\neither with a high air current speed, like the one at MacCook Field\nin Dayton for testing full-scale airplanes (figure 424), or of\nvariable density, as at Langley Field (figure 425).\n\n398\n\n/289\n\nGoing from the Polar Curve of a Model to a Real Polar Curve\nThe present manner of determining polar curves applicable to\nreal airplanes often has unsatisfactory results.\nAs a matter of fact, some people are content to derive airplane polar curves from wind tunnel tests on model wings. They are\nworking under the hypothesis that only the wings provide lift and\nthat the other parts of an airplane only contribute to drag. Under\nthese conditions, it obviously suffices to alter the values of\nC Z and Cx by taking account of the real surface area of the wing\nand of the supplementary drag that is added onto the wings\', which\nis estimated at best.\nOthers prefer to perform wind tunnel tests of an airplane -with\na fuselage. However, the Reynolds number is too small in experimental conditions, around the stays, for example, in relation to the\nReynolds number at other parts of the plane. The stays therefore\nare purely and simply eliminated from the models, which no longer\nresemble a real airplane.\nThe interaction between the wing and the other parts of the\nairplane thus is ignored, although it is probably one of the most\nimportant sources of drag.\nIt meanwhile can be assumed as a first approximation that if\na model airplane is better thati another, its superiority will be\nretained when full-sized. A qualitative, but not quantitative,\nclassification can thus be obtained.\nThere is therefore much to be said for trying to determine\na full-scale airplane\'s polar curve in the atmosphere.\nI am going to show that at the present time the difficulties\nof such a method do not surpass the means of modern experimenters,\nas has been claimed_._\nIV. Determining the Polar Curve of an Airplane in Flight\nHuguenard, Sainte-Lague and I have shown how it is possible\nto determine an airplane\'s aerodynamic characteristics by a chronophotographic procedure. The procedure has the advantage of measuring\nlift and drag during flight for birds just as well as for airplanes.\nCinematographic Method\nThis procedure consists of following the maneuvers of an airplane or other object in a known plane by sighting it through a\nCartesian coordinate grid with a double objective camera-gun. The\ncamera-gun, of the type designed by Huguenard, Planiol, and myself,\nsimultaneously furnishes clear images of the coordinate grid and of\n\n399\n\n\t\n\nthe flying target on the same film. It thus accurately records the\nlatter\'s geographic trajectory.\nKnowledge of such trajectories allows a problem similar to\nthat of the "inverse ballistic" to be Eulved in certain cases. It\nalso enables one to derive the laws of air resistance in a moving\nbody, and consequently the polar curve of a glider or airplane\ndeprived of the action of its propellor.\n1ww.3.N.\n\n\ti\n\nC,\n;,\t\n\n\t\nbX\n,\n\nt\n\na\n\t\nFigure 427\nFigure 426\n\t\nAerodynamic Forces\nDefinition of the Angles e, t, i\n\t\nExerted on an Airof an Airplane Describing a\n\t\nplane in Flight\nTrajectory in Still Air\n\t\nd) Lift\nKey: a) Trajectory\n\t\ne) General resultant of\nb) Velocity v\naerodynamic forces\nc) Drag\t\nTheory of Airplane Motion\n\n\t\n\n/290\n\nLet us take up again the theory describing airplane motion\nthrough the air. We shall limit ourselves to the essential points\nand suppose zero wind.\nWe shall consider a glider. Its center of gravity G describes\na trajectory whose tangent makes an angle 9 with the horizontal line\nOX. The same horizontal line also makes an an31e with the aircraft\'s fuselage.\t\n( See figure 426.)\nWe shall call angle i = R - * the glider\'s incidence for\nreasons of simplification. This is the same angle that is considered\nas a measurement of incidence in wind tunnel tests, moreover.\nIn the case of figure 426, the three angles a, i, t are\noositive. There is no wind, and the only vector involved, v, follows the tangent of the trajectory.\n\n400\n....^\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\n^\t\n\n.^.. ..ter.\n\nThere are two forces to consider: the airplane\'s weight P and\n\nC\n\nthe general resultant of aerodynamic forces, which we will suppose\npasses through G\nFrom the point of view that concerns us, it is convenient to\ndecompose the resultant into two components at right angles to each\nother. The decomposition can be approached in two different ways,\naccording to what type of study is being done. One way is to decompose the force into one component, Rx, pointed in a direction\nopposite to the airplane\'s velocity and known as drag, and a second\n\ncomponent, Rz, which is normal to the trajectory and is the customary\nlift. Another way is to break down the aerodynamic resultant into\nthe component p following the axis of the airplane and the component\np z normal to th* same axis. (See figure 427.)\nIf the lift v ire zero, the drag alone would constitute what is\n\noften called, for example in ballistics, "head resistance."\nConstruction of Polar Curves\n\nConsideration of p x and p \xc2\xb5 can be useful for the builder, for\nthese components directly give the stress an airplane has to support.\nHowever, only the first pair of components, RX and Rz, will be retained here. When an aerodvnamic balance whose supporting arm is constantly parallel to ;`he air current in the wind tunnel, as in Riffel\'s,\nis used, only the components along the air current\'s axis and normal\nto it are obtained by the weighings made, regardless of the model\'s\nangle of incidence.\nLet us recall here the conventional equations defining the\ncoefficients CX and Cz, which are used to construct the ordinary\npolar curves:\nCx\nRx \xc2\xb0 16 SV2\t\n\nRz = rpV2\n\nIn these equations S designates airfoil area and V the airplane\'s\nor air current\'s speed.\n\n/291\n\nThe experiments performed in wind tunnels have shown that the\nvalues of R z and Rx ,an4,consequently o; E C and CX , are closely\ndependent on the incidences given to the model\'s wings in relation to\nthe air current\'s direction.\nRemember that by making the abscissas the values of C X multiplied by 10, so that each curve is not too flat, and the ordinates\nthe values of Cz listed in, order of increasing incidence, a curve\nknown as the airplane\'s polar curve is obtained. For each angle,\nthe ratio R z/RX yields the aerodynamic efficiency. The maximum efficiency is the largest ratio found. It can also be obtained by drawing\nthe tangent tothe curve that passes through the origin 0 and finding\nthe ratio\'R;z/RX corresponding to the point of contact. Determining\nthe polar curve in this way can also be done for full-size airplanes.\n\n401\nss\n\nFigure 428\nPosition of Venturi Tobes\nT and t Linked to Differential\nManometers on a GourdouLeseurre Test Airplane\n\nFigure 429\nSchematic Diagram of\nDifferential Manometer\nfor Recording the Speed\nDifference behind and\nbeyond the Propellor\n\nStudy of a Motorized Airplane\nWe reduced the case of a motorized airplane to that of a\nglider thanks to the following device. Two multiple Venturi tubes\nare placed one behind the propellor and the other a little outside\nthe wings (figure 420). They are connected to a differential\nmanometer, which the pilot keeps at zero by controlling the engine,\nand to another, recording, differ<plt,ial manometer. These manometers\nare of the same type as those used in the wing stress indicators\n(figure 429) .\nUnder these conditions, the relative wind is the same before\nand after the propellor, whose effect on a glider is zero. The\ndifferential manometer is useful for studying the variations in\nspeed existing between different points on the airplane. All that\nhas to be done is to place the first manometer outside the wing and\nto attach the second at various spots, either in front of or to the\nrear of the wing, or near the fuselage or tail unit.\nkake the case of zero wind, which is not very common in the\natmosphere but sometimes exists. Consider the decomposition of the\ngeneral resultant of aerodynamic forces into drag Rx and lift Rz.\none can immediately derive the following two equations of motion by\nprojecting these forces, weight, and the force of inertia, on the\ntangent and the normal to the trajectory of the center of gravity.\nRx = P sin$\t\n\n(p/g) (d,V/dt)\n\nRz \xc2\xb0 P cos$ + ( P /g ) (\'V2/r ) ,\nwhere t indicates time, r the trajectory"s radius of curvature,\n0 the angle of the tangent to the trajectory with the horizontal,\nP the airplane\'s weight, and V its speed.\nAs the radius of curvature is not immediately obtainable, it \t\nis preferable to note that it is related to variations in the angle $\n\n/292\n\n402\n1\n\nby the following equation, in which ds is the differential of the arc\ndescribed..\n1/r s (w/180) (d6 /ds) - - ( ff /180) (ds/dt) (1/V)\nThe "-" sign comes from the sign conventions adopted here.\n\nThus, in the case of figure 426, the correctness of this sign is\nassured by noting that the angle $, which is positive, is\ndecreasint and as a result d$/dt is negative.\nAs to the term w/180, it occurs because we have supposed that\nall the angles are measured in degrees, and the derivation consequently introduces this coefficient.\nBy replacing the radius of curvature by its value, the following\nformulas are obtained:\nDrag RX = P sin$\t\n\n(P/g) (dV/dt)\n\nLift Rz = P cos$\t\n\n(P/g) (xrV/180) (d$/dt)\n\nIn the case where the airplane follows a trajectory of constant\nslope and velocity in still air, the equations to apply become:\nRz = P cosR\t\n\nRX = P\n\nsin$\n\nAll that needs to be known then is the flight weight of the\nairplane and the angle $. $ can be obtained with the help of the\nimages on film. The coordinate grid is transferred onto graph paper\nalong with the various positions of the airplane\'s center of gravity.\nThe angle between the straight line joining the centers and the\nhorizontal is $. one can verify on the graph that the angle is\nconstant and that the distance separating the different centers of\ngravity, which is proportional tothe airplane\'s speed, is also\nconstant.\n\nThe airplane\'s speed is determined by the formula V uL/l,\nwhere u is its apparent speed on the film, L its true length, and\nl its apparent length.\nThis done, the value of the angle T is found by measuring on\neach frame the angle a lubber line, e.g., the airplane\'s major antis,\nmakes with the horizontal.\nThe vehicle\'s incidence i to its trajectory is then the difference between the angles $ and T.\n\n/293\n\nThe Polar Curve of a Full-Size Airplane in Flight\nWe have used this method to successfully record numerous tra jectoriesof variable slope (figures 430 and 431) followed by a 180 hp\nGourdou-Leseurre airplane in zero wind with its propellor still.\n\n403\n\n,\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\'\t\n\n1\n\nr^\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nr\t\n\nf\t\n\n"\n\ni\n\nr\n\nI\n\nt\t\n\nI\t\n\nY\n\nFigure 430\nFilm of Coordinate Grid and Motion of a Gourdou-Leseurre\nAirplane Following a Rectilinear Trajectory at Constant\nSpeed with Propellor Still in Zero Wind\n(16 frames/sec) (Read from Top to Bottom and Left to Right)\n\n404\t\n\n.^ 1\n\n^^fy,\'^ .^,`\xe2\x80\xa2\'\n\nr\t\n\n\xc2\xab ..^\xe2\x80\xa2w..^ .\t\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n..\t\n\n.^\t\n\n\'^\t \'.^\xe2\x80\xa2"[\n\t\n\n\'^\n\ntit"\t ^M \xe2\x96\xbaL\xe2\x80\xa2Z/u^1:^\'.,y.\n\n.\xe2\x80\x94 . \xe2\x80\xa2 . r..rM. \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2 r\xe2\x80\xa2.\xe2\x80\xa2h.^^.w.. ...{\n`\t\n\n,\n\nfr\t\n\nrY+N../rr.\xe2\x80\xa2w.... n....... \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2. \xe2\x99\xa6 \xe2\x80\xa2.h.^..\t\n.^ ^ ^ ^, .,.\t\n^\t\n\xe2\x80\xa2ter\n\ny\n\n^\t\n\n1^C^\' \xe2\x80\xa2. ^ \xe2\x80\xa2.\xe2\x80\x94r; --^-. \xe2\x96\xba; rx:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n. l\n\n...\xc2\xab\xe2\x80\xa2\xc2\xab...rM\n\n-\xe2\x80\xa2^ _\xe2\x80\xa2 -\t\n\n-\t ..........r.............\n\nr^\'"vlr+.... ..\xe2\x80\xa2\xc2\xab rY .... \xe2\x80\xa2-w..i+^ .. -..\t\n\n....\n\ntll\n\n! ,\'\n\n4\n\n^^,.,... . c...r.+a..+^ ^....ir+ .rW+^r..r \xc2\xbb....^...:.i !

The polar curve also varies as the wings are deformed\nin flight under the effect of maneuvers or atmospheric disturbance.\n\n() I?[r^\nObv\t\n\n406\t\n\n4-P\n\nY^^(I^LF IS\n1\'^\n\nV. Determining a Bird 9 s Polar Curve\n\nWind Tunnel Stu dies\nAs soon as wind tunnels were invented, it came naturally to\nseveral researchers\' minds to find out the aerodynamic efficiency\nof birds. Tests were carried out by Lafa,y and Arnau before the war\non stuffed specimens placed in wind tunnels like mock-ups. They\nyielded results revealing that under these conditions the birds\nwere somewhat less efficient than the airplanes of the period, since\nthe ratio ^ ZJCx did not exceed 4 for vultures or seamews.\nSuch results are hardly surprising for the reasons given\nabove concerning the poorly understood interactions between the\nsupport and the object being tested. Also, the stuffed animals may\nno longer have a form comparable to that of living animals. Lastly\nand especially, the wings of the former are not at all comparable\nwith those of the latter.\nAs we have seen, an outstretched bird\'s wing ixit. support.ing its body\'s weight resembles a deep gutter. Placed in a wind\ntunnel, it, therefore opposes a significant resistance to the action\nof an appreciably regular air current. In reality, in flight a\nbird wing exhibits a characteristic double curvature that exhibits\nvery little resistance. In addition, avian wings are flexible and\ndeformable. In a wind tunnel., it is not possible to study a mockup of a flexible wing any more than a flexible wing. That would\nsuppose that the distribution of aerodynamic forces over the entire\nsurface were known.\nThe Gantry Crane Method\n\nIn contrast, the study of flexible wings in a natural variable\nwind is much more interesting, even though it furnishes only incomplete data.\nIf one marks on a rigid wing airplane\'s polar curve the incidences corresponding to each point, one has all the elements necessary\nfor determining its aerodynamic characteristics. Qn,the contrary, \t\nwith a flexible wing airplane or bird, the same tracing as a function\nof incidence must be constructed for each flight speed. since the\nwing becomes less arched as the flight speed increases, the efficiency of such flying machines, which is practically constant for ordinary\nairplanes!, is altered at the same time as the speed. The wing in\ngeneral flattens out at high speeds, and its aerodynamic efficiency\ntends to increase. The variation in efficiency could therefore be\nrepresented by a sort of polar curve that would describe a flexible\nwing by using wind speed as a variable for fixed incidences chosen\nbeforehand. In other words, the usual polar curve, for rigid wings,\nrepresents a curve whose coordinates, C and Cxs are expressed as\na function of incidence. In contrasts the coefficients C Z .and Cx\nhave to be expressed as a function of two parameters, the incidence\ni and the speed V, for flexible wings.\n\n407\n\n/294\n\n\t\n\ny\n\n.j\n\nFigure 434\nFamily of Polar and\nCharacteristic Curves of\na Flexible Wing Airplane\nVl,V 2 .., Various Speeds\nal,02... Various Incidences\n\nTwo families of curves can then\nbe constructed (figure 434). For every\nvalue of V there corresponds a polar\ncurve obtained by making wing incidence\nvary within the aircraft\'s limits of\nutilization. The polar curve group\nconstitutes a first family whose members are associated with the various\nforms a \xc2\xadsing can take under the influence of winds of different speed. If\non the contrary a is given a series of\nconstant values, a new curve, which\ncorresponds to each value and characterizes the wing\'s flexibility, is obtained by making the speed V of the wind\nstriking the wings under flying conditions vary. These characteristic\ncurves constitute a second family whose\nmembers are associated with the various\nforms a wing can take as its incidence\nchanges. The variations in speed\ndeform the wing profile and produce a\nvariation in the wing coefficients\nC and Cz. This engenders the curves\nof characteristics. Tile two families\nof curves obviously are derived from\neach other.\n\na) Case of a Flexible Wing Glider\n\nAlong with liuguena: \xe2\x80\xa2 d and Planiol, we took up the problem of\nstudying flexible wings and performed our first experiments with the\nflexible wing aircraft that I designed and of which we have already\nspoken.\n\n%I\n\nFigure 435\nCrane Setup for the Aerodynamic Study of the\nMagnan M2 Aircraft\n\n408\n\nFigure 436\nVariation of Wind Speed V,\nLift P and Drag R in an\nM2 Aircraft Suspended from\na Crane\n\ni000Z\nIAU,\n\nrho ^\n\n,.o k\n\n\t\n\n-\n\nI\t\n\n^^^ilr\'^ r, Z\n\n12\xe2\x80\xa2\nIOU -\n\ne\n\t\n\n^^ n\t\n\n~\'^\t\n\nL\nj\n\nf0\n\n.0 t\n\nr\n\njj\n"\xc2\xb0l1_t.\nV\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 10\n\nn ra^^i i.1^ rl\n\n"\n\nIt U\n\nI\xe2\x80\xa2 is :Y\n\n.i\n\nT6\n\nIs .io 31 36 A 34 w .T w M w\n\nFigure 437\nComparison of Predicted Average Polar Curve and Polar and\nCharacteristic Points Obtained in Gantry Crane Tests of an\nM2 Aircraft in a 6 m/sec Wind\nKey: a) Experimental polar curve \t\nat 6 m/sec\t\n\nb) Characteristic at 15\xc2\xb0 \t\nc) Predicted polar curve\n\nd) Line of flight (150)\ne) 5\xc2\xb0 Dive (10\xc2\xb0)\n\nf) 13\xc2\xb0 Climb (28\xc2\xb0)\n\nThe aircraft was suspended a certain distance from the ground\nby suitable supports equipped with dynamometers for measuring the\nhorizontal and verticalc;ompon,nts of the resultant of the forces\nexerted by the natural wind (figure 435). For these experiments, we\nfirst c l all used spring dynamometers. Their needle position was\nread every time a set period of time had paE,;ec. The speed and the\ndirection of the wind was noted at the same instant. As soon as\nthis empirical method showed us the value of the results obtained,\nwe photographed simultaneously both recording dynamometers every\nsecond, with two synchronized movie cameras. The time of the photograph was also marked cr.the anemometer\'s record. Once the difficulties resulting from making such tests in the open air were resolved,\nwe employed another procedure to discover in scontinuous manner the\nvariation in the lift of flexible wing aircraft. It consisted of\nusing high pressure hydrostatic dynamometers with remote recorders\ntime of 1/20 second.\nand a stabilization\t\nThe body of measurements was found to be consistent. It\nallowed us to isolate a certain number of the flexible wing aircraft\'s polar and characteristic points. With the help of the data\nfrom two hundred measurements, we were able to see that, as shown \t\n/295\nin figure 436, for all incidences the ratio of R to R x increases\nwith speed because the wing flattens out under tie force it is supporting. For a wind speed of 6 m/sec, the ratio R/Rx has a value of\n10 to 11 at an incidence of 10 1 , a value of about f0 at 15\xc2\xb0, and only\n\n409\nORIGNAL PAGE IS\nOF P(K)R QUAIJW\n\n5 to 6 at 28 0 . Other experiments have show that an aircraft\ndisplays an efficiency reaching as much as 13 for a wind speed\nequal to 11 m/sec and even 15 for a speed of more than 11 m/sec.\nWe also calculated the coefficients C Z and C in the usual\nmanner. We then transferred the average figures Rat we found\nonto the average polar curve predicted on the basis of the types\nof aircraft known through wind tunnel experiments on mock -ups.\nOne can see that for an incidence of 15\xc2\xb0 (figure 437), the group\nof points associated with high speeds is located above the points\nassociated with low speeds. This implies that the greater the\nwind speed is, the more efficient the airplane is, at least between the limits within likdhich we operated. The three points assocatod with a speed of 6 m/sec belong to the polar curve corresponding\nto that speed. The points associated with an incidence of 150\nthat incidence.\nbelong to the characteristic curve corresponding\n\nto\n\nIt could be argued that the elevated efficiency found for\nthe flexible wing aircraft is due to the fact that part of the\ndrag was eliminated by the Katzmayr effect. The experiments we\nhave done on this subject have shown that this reduction is not\nsignificant.\nb) Case of a Stuffed Bird\n\nI carried out experiments of the same type with stuffed birds.\nI constructed a special gantry crane, a sort of metal bridge 5\nmeters long and 50 cm high and held 5 meters from the ground by two\nposts suitably braced up. The bird, an albatross, was supported\nby wires attached-.o the forearm of each wing and fixed by their\nlower part to the shaft of a recording spring dynamometer and by\ntheir upper part to plates giving them the desired tension.\nTwo small, pylons maintained the wires supporting the drag that\nthe air exerted on the bird in a forward position. These wires were\nalso connected to inscribing spring dynamometers. A third pylon\nplaced on the opposite side held a stay held taut by a coil spring\nwhich kept the assembly rigid.\nChanges in the bird\'s incidence were obtained with a device\nable to pivot the bird\'s axis in the vertical plane.\nAt the same time as variations in lift and drag for-each wing\nwere recorded, .instruments measured the instantaneous speed, inclination, and orientation of the wind.\nThe experiments show first of all that the posterior part of\nan albatross\'s wing changes shape considerably in response to the\naction of the wind and follows all the wind\'s fluctuations. Furthermore, the measurements made by the apparatus revealed a maximum aero-\n\n410\n\n/296\n\ndynamic efficiency of 17. This could be in part the consequence of\nthe Katzmayr effect, given the amplitude of some of the oscillations.\n\nFigure 438\nRectilinear Trajectory Described by a Martin at Constant\nSpeed, without Beating its Wings\n1 50\n\ntoo\n\n\xe2\x80\x94\n\nC\n\nd\n\nIon\t {I\xe2\x80\x94\nn\t \xe2\x80\x94"\n\n11.5\n\xe2\x80\x94 ,\t\n\n- Iud Cr\t\n\nFigure 439\t\nPolar Points of a\t\nMartin in Flight\t\n\ntoo\n\n0\t\n\nrt0\t\n\n20\t\n\n\t\n\n_\n30\t\n\n100 (\',x-\n\nFigure 440\nComparison of Average Polar\nCurve of a Martin (B) and\nthe Polar Curve of a GourdouLeseurre Airplane in Flight (A)\n\nCinematographic Method\nThe possible existence of such an effect on the one hand and,\non the other, the manner of attaching the bird, which created a\nsituation where the wings neither supnortrd the animal\'s weight as\nin flight nor retained the natural flight form, should naturally\nlead to applying the chronophotographic method to birds gliding in\na calm atmosphere. At this moment, it is certain that the animals\nexhibit the form of least resistance, the most favorable for gliding,\nand at certain moments the greatest efficiency.\n\n/297\n\nHowever, since birds fly where and how they wish, much patience\nis needed to film a flight in the vicinity of the coordinate grid,\n\n411\n\ngiven that the flight has to be basically parallel to the grid. It\nmust also be a glide, i.e. the bird must follow a rectilineal descending trajectory without beating its wings once. Finally, the wind has\nto be completely absent.\nWe were able meanwhile to obtain some satisfactory trajectories\n(figure 438) with a house martin (chelidon urbica L.). we were able\nto find four polar points which formed a curve different from that of\na motorized airplane (figures 439 and 440). This curve shows that as\nthe angle of incidence grows, lift rapidly increases, while drag\nundergoes much smaller changes. In addition, the bird\'s aerodynamic\nefficiency attained a maximum of 30, which is five times greater than\nthat of the fighter we studied.\nWe assumed in tracing the curve that the bird\'s wing had kept\nan appreciably similar form throughout its gliding. This is probably\ninaccurate.\n.\nConclusions\n\nIn the course of the lessons which I have had the honor of\npresenting to you, I strove to show you all the interest aviation\nhas in the study of avian flight. I indicated the research that\nhad been carried out on\ncreatures as well as the experimental\nmethods employed. You have been able to see that these new methods\nwere all applicable to studying aircraft flight and have yielded\ninteresting, useful data just as much for science as present-day\naeronautics.\n\nflying\n\nNature reveals to us examples of different modes of flight\neach day. They take on a truly impressive multiplicity of forms\nwhose study can only prove to be very fertile in the future.\nIs this to say that we must get our inspiration only from the\nexample of birds and other flying creatures? Not necessarily, but\nthe repeated observation of Living things gliding through the air\nis very educational. It can make us hope that human science will\none day discover flying apparatus of a design completely different\nfrom contemporary airplanes, which will seem primitive and childish\nto our descendents.\nIn any case, it must be affirmed very forcefully that progress\n\nin current airborne locomotion or the birth of a new type of\n\nlocomotion can only come out of experimental research. In aeronautical\nscience, as in the others, progress is based on experimentation, and\non experimentation alone.\nI do not want to finish this course without taking advantage\nof the opportunity offered me to note that the scientific findings\nrelated in these lessons and which are due to my collaborators and\nmyself could only be obtained thanks to the considerable support of\nthe Caisse des Recherches Scientifiques de l\'Aeronautique [ Fund for\nScientific Research in Aeronautics] and of J.-L.
