The e\xef\xac\x80ect of other stations\nsuch as HartRAO and Kokee Park to enhance the East-West baseline coverage is also considered. It is\nanticipated that the simulation results will help IVS to decide on the composition of the CRF sessions\nof the IVS to be run from 2011 onward.\n\n1. Introduction\nA de\xef\xac\x81cit of observations of radio sources in the Southern Hemisphere makes development of a\nprogram dedicated to exploiting the new Australian and New Zealand radio telescopes a priority.\nThese fast slewing antennas bring the bene\xef\xac\x81t of quickly producing a large number of observations,\nbut due to their small size (12 meters), the number of available sources is limited. We considered\ndi\xef\xac\x80erent network con\xef\xac\x81gurations consisting either of these new antennas alone or these antennas\ncomplemented by existing larger diameter antennas. We show that these networks can process a\nsu\xef\xac\x83cient number of radio sources with a \xef\xac\x82ux density of 1 Jy or more to meet desired astrometric\ngoals. Special attention was devoted to the Australian\xe2\x80\x93Chinese network.\nTable 1.

Solution Statistics\nWe used two source selection scenarios. For the \xef\xac\x81rst scenario, the SKED program was used to\nselect objects from a list of 120 strong radio sources (\xef\xac\x82ux density \xe2\x89\xa5 1 Jy in S/X-bands), almost all\nof them located in the Southern Hemisphere. For the second scenario, 159 radio sources around\nthe ecliptic zone were added to the list of 120 sources. Figures 1\xe2\x80\x933 show the number of sources,\nscans, and group delays scheduled in the ten networks using both source selection scenarios. Due\nto di\xef\xac\x80erent network con\xef\xac\x81gurations SKED selected di\xef\xac\x80erent numbers of sources for the simulated\n24-hour sessions. For a regional network, comprised of the 12-meter Australian and New Zealand\nfacilities only, the number of sources is 20, whereas for the largest network (No. 10) the number of\nsources is about 180 (Figure 1). The number of scans varies from 100 to 500 (Figure 2), and the\nnumber of group delays varies from 350 to 1000\xe2\x80\x931500 (Figure 3).\n\nFigure 1. Number of sources scheduled for\nthe two source selection scenarios.\n\nFigure 2. Number of scans scheduled for the\ntwo source selection scenarios.\n\nFigure 3. Number of group delays scheduled\nfor the two source selection scenarios.\n\nThese statistics show that even the small regional network of four 12-meter antennas produces\na su\xef\xac\x83cient number of observations to ful\xef\xac\x81ll the astrometric goals. The addition of HartRAO,\nIVS 2010 General Meeting Proceedings\n\n177\n\nOleg Titov et al.:\n\nCRF Network Simulations\n\nFortaleza, and Kokee (networks 4, 5, and 6) does not change these numbers dramatically. The\naddition of the Chinese stations Seshan25, Urumqi, and Kunming in di\xef\xac\x80erent combinations (networks 2, 3, 8, and 9) looks more promising. Our results show that the \xef\xac\x81nal network (No. 10) with\nten antennas is the best option; however, this network is unlikely to be realized on a regular basis.\nSimulations for a third scenario using the list of the 295 ICRF2 de\xef\xac\x81ning radio sources [1] have\nalso been examined. These sources are more evenly distributed across the sky, so the number of\nscheduled sources varies from 84 to 200 for the di\xef\xac\x80erent network con\xef\xac\x81gurations.\n\n3. Positional Accuracy\nThe core network of four 12-meter dishes produces a reasonable accuracy for the 20 selected\nradio sources. Figure 4a shows that for this schedule the formal standard deviations lie within\na range of 1\xe2\x80\x935 mas. The results for the second scenario (including ecliptic sources) are similar\n(Figure 4b).\nThe standard deviations of individual radio sources in the ICRF2 scenario lie within a range\nof 5\xe2\x80\x93200 mas. Many more sources were scheduled (89) with many observed only one or two times,\nwhich results in large formal errors. In Figure 4c we plotted only the 19 sources observed at least\n5 times. Alternatively, scheduling 14 ICRF2 de\xef\xac\x81ning sources astrometrically yielded formal errors\nof 2\xe2\x80\x935 mas.\nSimulations for network No. 10 for all three cases are more similar. For the full group of\n120 Southern Hemisphere sources the standard deviations are within the range of 1\xe2\x80\x933 mas, with\nsome values up to 10 mas (Figure 4d). The other two scenarios provide more radio sources to be\nscheduled; consequently, more formal errors exceed 3 mas (Figures 4e and 4f). Nonetheless, the\nnumber of sources with standard deviations within a range of 1\xe2\x80\x933 mas is still adequate for accurate\nastrometry.\n\n4. Conclusions\nWe can use the AuScope/New Zealand network of four VLBI sites for a program of astrometry\nof strong radio sources in the Southern Hemisphere. In conjunction with the facilities from the\nwider Asia-Paci\xef\xac\x81c region, the network could be used to densify the reference radio sources along the\necliptic zone. Further improvement of the technical speci\xef\xac\x81cations of the 12-meter antennas, such\nas the reduction of SEFD values, will make the observational astrometric programs signi\xef\xac\x81cantly\nmore \xef\xac\x82exible.\n\n5.
