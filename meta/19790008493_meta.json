Any changes detected in these parameters as a function of time during the mission are then attributable to surface contamination or to increased material absorption. These basic functions are attained in the optical effects module by virtue of the following subsystems which are described: module enclosure; light source with collimator and modulator; sample wheel with holders and rotary drive; photomultipliers for radiation detection; processing and sequencing electronic circuitry; and power conditioning interfaces. The functions of these subsystems are reviewed and specified.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19790008493, "id": "e9c7de07fcdb4ab7861359790b49a8b8", "publicationDate": "1978-10-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19790008493.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19790008493/downloads/19790008493.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19790008493/downloads/19790008493.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19790008493/downloads/19790008493.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
