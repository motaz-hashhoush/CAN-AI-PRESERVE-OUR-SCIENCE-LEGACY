Generation of MSl from HSI\nsupports several investigations\nengineering\ntrade studies related\nsimulate MSI. In addition, the\nmonitoring calibration changes\n2.\n\nSIMULATION\n\ngiven\n\nincluding selection of multispectral\nsensor band edges, and\nto on-board or ground-based aggregation of HSI to\nutility of this technique as a potential procedure for\nin spaceborne instruments is also addressed.\n\nMETHODOLOGY\n\nThe signal, Se, (in electrons)\nby :\nSe=\n\nK _ R(_,)\n\nin a selected waveband\n\nF(k)\n\nk/hc\n\nof a multispectral\n\ndk\n\nsensor is\n(1)\n\nwhere R(Z) represents the sepctral radiance distribution at the sensor aperture, F(_.) is\nthe combined spectral responsivitiy\nof the sensor (including spectral filter response,\ndetector spectral responsivity, etc.), and K represents an assortment of wavelength\nindependent components\nincluding sensor aperture solid angle, integration time, detector\nsize, etc. The conversion between photons and electrons is represented by the term h/hc.\nThe integration is performed over the spectral bandpass of the band in question.\nThe process of inverting equation (1), eg. the estimation of R(k)\nfrom a\nmeasured signal does not have a unique solution. Instead, one may estimate the\nequivalent radiance, Re, ie. the spectrally flat radiance distribution which when used in\nequation (1) would produce the same measured signal:\n\nSe=\nEquating\n\nK.f\n\nRe\n\nF(k)\n\n_,/hc\n\ndk\n\n-\n\nK Re _ F(_.)\n\n_,/hcdk\n\n(1) and (2) we have a definition\n\nof this equivalent\n\nradiance:\n\nRe\n\n/\n\nd_.\n\n(2)\n\n=\n\n.[ R(k)\n\nF(k)\n\n_.d_,\n\n_ F(_,)\n\nk\n\n(3)\n\nThe equivalent radiance, Re, when multiplied by the nominal sensor bandpass, Ak, is\ncommonly referred to as the "inband" radiance. The relationship between this inband\nradiance and Landsat digital values, Dn, is defined through the calibration information\nsupplied with Landsat data :\nRe A_, = Gain * Dn + Offset\n\n(4)\n\nSimulation of Landsat digital data can therefore be accomplished\nthrough computation\nthe inband radiance, Re A_,, followed by application of the appropriate band calibration\ncoefficients.\nCalibrated\n\nimagery,\n\nsuch as that produced\n\nby the AVIRIS\n\n97\n\nsensor is an ideal\n\nof\n\ncandidate estimation\nfor\n\nof R(k).\nGiven n hypersperspectral bands spanning the bandpass\nsensor band being simulated, equation (3) can be approximated\nas :\n\nof the multispectral\nn\n\nRe\n\n=\n\n_\n\nRA(i)\n\nF(k i) _,iA_,i\n\n/\n\nZ\n\nF(_, i) _\'i AZ\'i\n\n(5)\n\ni=l\nwhere RA(i) is the calibrated\ncenter wavelength\nresponse\n\nradiance\n\nalso improves\nthe bandpass\n\nmeasured\n\nof band i, A_, i is the bandpass\n\nvalue of the sensor being simulated\n\nRe can be generated\n\n3.\n\nspectral\n\ndepends\n\nas the number\nin question\n\nEXPERIMENT\n\non the calibration\nand spectral\n\nin AVIRIS\n\nof band i, and\n\nat wavelength\n\nband i, _\'i is the\n\nF(_, i) is the spectral\n\n_\'i" The fidelity\n\naccuracy of the hyperspectral\n\nresolution\n\nof the hyperspectral\n\nwith which\nimagery and\n\nbands covering\n\nincreases.\nAND\n\nRESULTS\n\nWe have investigated\nthe merits of this simulation technique using an AVIRIS\nscene collected nearly coincident with a Landsat TM scene. The AVIRIS scene obtained\non 10/08/90 at 1041 Z, and covers the area surrounding Corvallis Oregon. A Landsat 5\nTM scene (geometrically\n\ncorrected,\n\nP type data) was collected\n\non the same day at\n\napproximately\n1745 Z. Weather reports generated at Eugene (50 miles away) as well as\nthe general appearance of both images indicate a relatively clear, cloud free atmosphere\nduring the acquisitions.\nThe FWHM and center wavelength files accompanying\nthe\ncalibrated AVIRIS imagery were used in equation (3). Preflight measurements\nof the\nLandsat sensor spectral response function (Engel, 1990) were used as a source for F( ki ).\nThe six reflective\n\nbands of the l_andsat\n\n(3) and (5) along with calibration\n\n5 TM instrument\n\nwere simulated\n\ndata found in the TM data header file.\n\nusing equations\n(A multiplicative\n\nsun angle correction based on the change in solar zenith angle between the two collections\nwas applied to the simulated TM radiances prior to conversion to digital counts.)\n3.1\ndata.\n\nEvaluation\n\nof\n\nResults\n\nA portion of the TM scene was geometrically\nwarped to overlay the AVIRIS\nA common sub area of the two images was then extracted for statistical analysis.\n\nColor composites\nof the simulated and actual TM scenes are provided in Slide 3.\nHistograms\nof the simulated and actual TM bands were computed for the spatially\nregistered areas. A few of the histograms are displayed in Figure 1 and a summary of the\nscene statistics presented in Table 1. The agreement between simulated and actual scene\nstatistics and histograms is exceptionally\ngood.\nBoth band 4 and band 5 histogram\ncomparisons\nshow the simulated image histograms to be slightly compressed.\nTo\ninvestigate\nthe source of this effect we computed statistics for several homogeneous\nareas in the simulated TM imagery and corresponding\nareas in the _\noriginal\n\nsub\nTM\n\nimage. Samples of these results are plotted in Figure 2. Linear relationships between\nsimulated Dn and actual TM Dn were found to exist for each band. The linear regression\ndata are shown in Table 2. Several investigators\n(including Thome et al, 1993) have\nobserved a decrease in TM response in each band over the course of the years. Since\nEOSAT has not changed calibration coefficients since 1986, we would expect that use of\nthose coefficients to compute Dn from the radiance derived using the AVIRIS data would\nyield ]aig]lg,Lvalues than the actual digital values observed in the TM scene.\nUnfortunately,\nthis is not what we observed.\nThis discrepancy suggests that perhaps the\nAVIRIS calibration for this data set is erroneously low. With only one data set it is\ndifficult to draw decisive conclusions regarding the source of these discrepancies.\nIn this analysis\nprocedure.\n\nA rigorous\n\nwe have focussed\nsimulation\n\nupon the radiometric\n\nof multispectral\n\nfidelity of the simulation\n\nimagery would include an accurate\n\n98\n\nmodelingfelectronic signal\no\nand\ndependent\nnoise\n\nin the image, as well as modification\nof\nthe MTF characteristics\nas appropriate.\nThe spectral band aggregation generally produces\nthe desirable effect of decreasing the noise level in the simulated image. The user is then\nflee to add back in the desired amount of noise expected in the sensor product so long as\nthe individual spectrometer\nband noise levels are comparable to those of the sensor to be\nsimulated.\nFurthermore,\nthe aggregation procedure increases the effective bit-resolution\n\nof the simulated data, allowing the user to explore design tradeoffs related to bit allocation\nand digitization\nschemes. Finally, the accuracy of the simulation is dependent upon the\nspectral resolution of the HSI. The number of bands actually required will most likely\ndepend on the shape and complexity\nof the sensor response function being simulated.\n3.2\n\nPotential\n\napplications\n\nof\n\nthe\n\nsimulation\n\ntechnique.\n\nDiscrepancies\nbetween the simulated TM data and the actual TM data can be\nattributed to calibration errors in either instrument, as well as to the coarseness arising\nfrom the limited number of AVIRIS spectral bands covering any given TM band,\nparticularly\nin the shorter wavelengths.\nChanges in responsivity\nfor the TM instrument\nthroughout the years have been observed by investigators\nincluding Thome et al. (1993).\nWe performed an experiment\nin which we shifted the long wavelength edge of the TM2\nspectral response curve; in effect, changing the effective f\'dter passband. The long edge\nwas shifted from -10 nm to +10 nm from its nominal position. The statistics derived\nfrom these experiments\nare shown in Table 3. It is clear that a change in filter response\nsimilar to this could be detected and quantified using imagery simulated from underflights\nwith a hyperspectral\nsensor such as AVIRIS. We are currently performing analyses to\ndetermine if this procedure can be used to identify the exact nature of the change in filter\nresponse : eg. to distinguish between shifts at the low or high wavelength\nend, or both,\nas well as changes in transmittance\ndue to contamination of the optical surfaces or\nchanges in detector responsivity\nover time.\n4.0\n\nSUMMARY\n\nWe have presented a procedure for simulating multispectral\nimagery using\nhyperspectral\ndata. The simulation technique is straightforward\nand has been shown to\nproduce encouraging\nresults in the one case studied, although with only one data set it is\nimpossible\nto distinguish errors in the AVIRIS calibration or the TM calibration. We are\ncurrently in the process of obtaining additional data sets to use in further validation of the\nprocedure.\nIt is clear however, that reasonable simulations of multispectml\nimagery can\nbe produced using this technique.\nA simulation technique such as this provides the\ncapability to perform engineering\ndesign trades for future multispectral\nsensors related to\ndetermination\nof spectral band placement.\nIn addition, the analysis technique may be\nuseful as a tool for monitoring changes in calibration of space sensors using aircraft\nunderflights.\nThe sensitivity of this technique for detecting changes in sensor\ncharacteristics\nis currently under study.\n5.0\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThe authors\n\nwish to thank Dr. P.
