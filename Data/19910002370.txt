Airborne\n\n*\n\n- \'Terms of Reference\n\nTools of the Trade, Wally Gillman, American Airlines\n\nTo all of you here, I would like to say, it\'s a privilege to be able to talk to you today\nand also very much a challenge. Listening to the previous speakers, I could agree with\nseveral things that they\'ve said, first of all, Dave Johnson talked about this being a\nsystem problem. That very much is and that\'s going to basically be the thrust of my\npresentation, although I say it in different words.\n\nRoland said I would have the\n\nopportunity to articulate operational requirements. I don\'t even know what articulate\nis, so I\'m going to have a difficult time there and Herb talked about this meeting\nbeing in three phases, hazard characteristics, sensor development, and ground systems,\nand since we\'re starting off at the beginning, I guess I\'m part of the hazard\ncharacteristics.\n\nLet me talk a little bit about myself because I will be referring to some personal\nexperiences here as I go through. I\'m a Captain with American Airlines, been flying\nfor over 21 years with American, and about 30 years all together. Seventeen years of\nthat flying was on the line, where day after day after day we\'d go out and fly in\nvarious weather conditions. For the last .3 1/2 years, I\'ve been a Manager of Flying\nEngineering for American, which means that my job is to interface with such people\nas yourself to try to define what our needs are, to try to help develop some\nequipment. I do test flights, new equipment and new airplanes and when we have\ncertification requirements, then I represent the FAA in certification flights of\nequipment on our airplane.\n\nOriginally, this presentation was supposed to be called Industry: Terms of Reference.\nThat was a little scary to me, so I asked if we could change that and actually the title\n\n13\n\nnow i \'Tools for the Trade." Tools for the Trade, and first of all, before I talk about\ns\nsome of these tools, let me talk a little bit about the trade. This viewfoil represents\nthe magnitude of the daily operations of commercial airplanes in the United States in\n1987.\n\n6.5 million commercial airline flights. Almost 1 , O daily flights. A little\n8O O\n\nperhaps, personal note, on Sunday the 16th of October, American Airlines flew 231\nmillion revenue passenger miles. That\'s an awful lot of operations and an awful lot\n\nt\n\nof people travelling an awful lot of miles. I t i k the point that I would like to make\nhn\nhere is that we do this daily, every day and we do it in rain or shine, wind shear,\nweather conditions, etc. Now, all of you, in this group, are very familiar with wind\nshears but we tend to focus on microburst quite a bit, but there are all kinds of wind\nshears that we encounter every day. Almost every one of these flights encounters\nsome kind of wind shear. And a lot of these types of wind shears have caused\naccidents. A long time ago, an American Airlines airplane hit the dike at La Guardia,\nRunway 31. That shear is probably due to physical obstruction. And, years ago, going\n\nin the midway airport, we always used to have to be careful of the wind shear because\n\nof the hangers and the buildings, so those are physical obstructions. We go places\nwhere we have wind shears continuously, like in Amsterdam. These types of things\nare daily occurrences. They\'re serious. Some of them can be very serious as Roland\npointed out in his slide, and we have to take them seriously. But we deal with these\nthings on a daily basis and we need the tools to deal with these things.\n\nIf you\'ll allow me, I\'d like to make a few personal references, to talk a little bit about\nsome daily decisions because I think it\'s important that you understand how we use\nthese tools in daily operation of 18,000 flights a day. Not long ago, as a matter of fact\n\n4\n\non the 23rd of September, I flew a flight from Chicago to Dusseldorf, Germany, and\nthat particular day, there was a line of storms. So I got on the telephone and talked\nto the dispatcher. We agreed on a little different routing, adjusted the fuel, and off\n\nI went and didn\'t have any problems. We went through to Dusseldorf with no\n\n14\n\nI\n\nproblem.\n\nThe point is, I used some available tools.\n\nWe used satellite weather\n\ndepiction, we used weather reports that we had available.\n\nWe used some radar\n\nreturns that we had available and we made some decisions. Now, as a result of that\n\'1,\n\nwe had a non-occurrence. That doesn\'t mean to say that that event wasn\'t out there.\ni\nb\n\nI know a lot of people out there are concerned when we talk about forward looking\nb\n\nsensors, about the fact that by the time you get there the event might not be there,\nit might be related to a false alarm or something like that. Well in this case, there\nwas no event that I wasn\'t concerned about a false alarm, I had a smooth trip. Also,\nabout six weeks ago, I flew with a fellow from NASA Langley here, whose name is\nCharlie Knox, I\'m sure Roland knows Charlie. Charlie\'s got a project on data link,\nand so I flew him on a Boeing 767 and we went from Dallas to Dulles and I was\ndemonstrating the data link. Now on this particular trip, we rolled out on course and\nright in front of us was a thunderstorm which was painted on the weather radar. I\nsaid to Charlie, "Well, we\'re going to have to deviate around this thing, but let\'s take\nour time, let\'s look at what\'s developing on either side of that storm and beyond that\nstorm so we can make our decision in which way to deviate." So we looked at the\nscope, evaluated the radar returns, and eventually I deviated left.\n\nWe ended up\n\ndeviating for about 250 miles and finally went through the hole and went on to Dulles.\nAgain, a smooth ride, a non-event. But I used the tools that were available to make\nthat decision.\n\nAbout a month ago, I was flying a Boeing 767 at Moses Lake,\n\nWashington, on a test flight. Part of that test is to fly autoland approaches. We came\ninto Moses Lake and ahead of us was a 747. Now, a 747 is a huge airplane that\ncreates a lot of vortices, and sure enough as we got down on final approach, we\nstarted encountering quite a bit of, what you might term as turbulence. The airplane\nshaking around. We decided to go around rather than continue that approach because\nwe didn\'t feel the automatic system would be able to handle the shear turbulence\nconditions as we were encountering them. So that was a decision based upon actually\n\n15\n\nencountering something, not having any idea of the magnitude that was at the front\nof us, but not be willing to continue on into it.\n*\n\nNow, those are very recent things, but let me talk a little bit more about something\n4\n\nvery pertinent to what we\'re going to talk about here. About one week after Delta\n191 accident in Dallas, I was taxiing out to take o f on Runway 17 right at\nf\n\nAirport.\n\nDFW\n\nEverybody was very conscience of wind shear after that accident.\n\na\n\nI\n\nremember there was some storms coming in from the northwest and we were watching\n\nf.\nit as we were in a line of airplanes waiting to take o f We looked at the wind socks.\nWe were listening to the tower reports from the LLWAS system, the winds at various\nportions around the airport. I was number 2 for take off and I said to my co-pilot,\n"I\'m not going to go on this runway." But just at that time, the number 1 crew in line,\nPan Am, said, "I\'m not going to go." Then the whole line said, "We\'re not going to\ngo" then the tower taxied us all down the runway, took us about 15 minutes, down to\nthe other end. By that time the storm had kind of passed by and we all launched to\nthe north. We were using the tools to make those decisions. The tools that we had\navailable. That\'s the kind of thing that goes on daily. One other example where I\nwish I had a tool, this is back in the ~O\'S,I was flying co-pilot to Charleston, West\nVirginia. Now that airport sits on top of the mountain and it\'s kind of a short runway.\n\nYou don\'t like to land with too much speed because you could run off the far end.\nOn the approach, to the runway, you\'re coming over a great big valley and on that\napproach, I noticed that the power was way back at idle, very much reduced from\nwhat it normally would be. So we discussed the fact that we must have a tail wind\nat that point, but the tower was reporting a cross wind at the runway. A cross wind\nalmost at our maximum for the airplane, which was a Boeing 727, so we discussed the\nfact that we better carry a little extra air speed because we were going to encounter\n\na shear. I sure would like to have had a forward looking device so that we could\nhave told how big that shear was going to be. But we carried 25 knots extra airspeed,\n\n16\n\nI\n\nwhich, when you\xe2\x80\x99re looking at a short runway on the top of a mountain, is an awful\nlot of airspeed to carry. Well we got there, and I would say, it felt like two seconds\nwe lost 25 knots. Just like that. I dropped the wing down and just barely saved the\n\nI\n\n0\n\nlanding. We had a reasonable landing, rolled out, and went to the terminal. Nobody\n\n\xe2\x80\x98F\n\nknew anything about it, except the guys in the cockpit. I could have used a forward\n3\n\nlooking sensor for that particular situation.\n\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve taken quite a bit of time to talk about myself, let\xe2\x80\x99s talk about these tools for the\ntrade. I would like to make a little quote from Aeroline, which is a newsletter that\xe2\x80\x99s\npublished by ARINC Radio for the AEEC. This is in from the chairman\xe2\x80\x99s corner.\nIt says, \xe2\x80\x9cWe engineers are notorious for becoming entranced with technology for what\nit can do rather than for what we need it to do. And why? Our industry cannot\nafford and will not tolerate such a attitude.\xe2\x80\x9d I\xe2\x80\x99m glad an engineer said that rather\nthan me, you know.\n\nWe have some valuable tools coming along. The first one is some valuable training\ntools that have been developed over the last couple of years as a result of the FAA\nand industry working on understanding wind shear and particularly microburst. Bob\nIreland was involved with this group. They came up with a authoritative training aid\nthat we have used to make changes in oqr training recently. This is very valuable in\nour ground training.\n\nWe are much more aware of the conditions that create\n\nmicroburst and the things to look for that we might be able to detect it and avoid it.\nIn our simulator training, we have microburst models and wind shear models and we\nhave our pilots fly through various wind shear scenarios, practicing detection, detecting\nwhen the wind shear is occurring, and then practicing an escape manuever. Now, we\ntalked about having an unstable approach. When you have an unstable approach, it\xe2\x80\x99s\ntime to execute an escape manuever.\n\n17\n\n!\n\nLet me tell you folks, this escape manuever is not a very nice thing. So let me talk\n\na little bit about escape manuever. It\xe2\x80\x99s something that I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be in if I can\navoid it. First of all, when you look at the pilot procedures, they seem pretty straight\nforward. Use maximum power, rotate to 15 degrees at pitch attitude and then control\n4\n\nthe flight path. That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t seem very difficult, but let me tell you, that is an extreme\n6\n\nmanuever from the standpoint of pilot technique. You are operating at a region which\nyou normally don\xe2\x80\x99t operate in and it\xe2\x80\x99s not something that I want to get involved with\nif I can avoid it. As far as controlling the flight pass, generally we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about\nstopping a sink so we don\xe2\x80\x99t lose altitude and eventually, if you trade off enough air\nspeed in order to stop this sink, you\xe2\x80\x99re going to be approaching the limits or stick\nshaker and you have to respect that and not go into the stick shaker.\n\nWell, I would\n\nlike to take a minute to talk about this escape manuever. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how many\npilots we have in the audience but I would like to take it out of the airplane\nenvironment and discuss it from a different perspective.\n\nFirst of all, what is wind\n\nshear? Wind shear, I have characterized as stepping off a moving sidewalk like at\n\nDFW airport. What happens is that the top part of the body continues to go forward\nat the same speed but all of a sudden the legs are slowed up because they are no\nlonger on the moving sidewalk. So that\xe2\x80\x99s basically the same as wind shear. That\xe2\x80\x99s\nsomething we can understand and the same affect happens to an airplane. Now, we\xe2\x80\x99re\ndealing with something called angle of attack.\n\n-4nd I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to get into\n\naerodynamics but, I need to show you what angle attack is before I can continue.\n(Slide of airfoil at high angle of attack) Here we have an airfoil section, a section\nthrough a wing, which the airplane is pointed horizontally. But the airplane is actually\ngoing down this path here so that the relative wind is up in that direction. So what\n\n4\n\nwe have here is the angular difference between the attitude of the airplane and the\nflight path of the airplane, this is the angle of attack at that airfoil. When this angle\nattack exceeds a certain amount, you get over the top surface of the wing instead of\ngetting laminar flow. You lose the lift from the top of the wing and then the airplane\n\n18\n\nc\n*\n\nis going to come down! Plain and simple. Particularly if you\xe2\x80\x99re in the midst of an\nescape manuever in which you already have maximum power.\nc\n\nThe only way to\n\nrecover is to lower the nose a little bit, reduce the angle of attack, get laminar flow\nover the wing and try to fly out. All right, that\xe2\x80\x99s all I\xe2\x80\x99m going to talk about angle of\nattack. Now let\xe2\x80\x99s go back to my moving sidewalk analogy. We\xe2\x80\x99re going to put a guy\non a treadmill (Slide of man on treadmill tilted at steep angle with rear (low) end in\nthe water and net accross high end) Normally the guy moves right along, and there\nare no problems. He\xe2\x80\x99s got lot\xe2\x80\x99s of treadmill between the bad water down here and\nthis bad condition up here (net) which represents stick shaker conditions and the end\n\nof the treadmill where stall would occur and the guy would fall off. So this guy just\nmarches along doing his thing. But now when we get into wind shear and he\xe2\x80\x99s doing\nthe escape maneuver, he gets into a very critical situation where he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have very\nmuch to play with. (Slide - similar to previous slide except very little distance between\nthe water and the net) He is very close to disaster down near the water and disaster\nup near the net and the end of the treadmill. Now we\xe2\x80\x99re going to turn the lights out\nso he can\xe2\x80\x99t see how close he is to this stick shaker (net) because there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing in the\n\ncockpit of older airplanes that shows you where stick shaker is. So our guy is going\nblindly along hoping that he won\xe2\x80\x99t get into the net and hoping he is doing enough to\nkeep from falling into the water. Now, no only am I going to turn the lights out but\nI\xe2\x80\x99m going to simulate up drafts and down drafts by changing the pitch of the treadmill\nup and down. Now our guy is going around in the dark trying to stay in this little bit\n\nof treadmill while it is pitching up and down. That\xe2\x80\x99s kind of like an escape maneuver.\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s not a maneuver I want to have to accomplish.\n8\n\nAnother valuable tool is the airborne reactive wind shear system that has been under\ndevelopment for a number of years. Bob Ireland and I have been working on an S7\ncommittee of SAE, trying to define the operational characteristics of such a system.\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s a reactive airborne system like I fly on the Boeing 767 right now. It is a very\n\n19\n\nuseful tool. We are able to reinforce what we are seeing in the cockpit with this\ndetection alerting system. It reinforces the fact that we\xe2\x80\x99re in trouble and that it is due\nto wind shear. You know, a lot of times there can be turbulence and as I said earlier,\nday after day, after day, after day we operate into weather conditions where we have\nshears, we have turbulence, we have deterioration of flight path, and we counter those\nconditions and continue operating. Now all of a sudden, we\xe2\x80\x99ve got a device to help\nus recognize when this shear is beyond the normal limits and annunciates \xe2\x80\x98bind shear\xe2\x80\x9d\nand provides us with flight director guidance for the escape.\n\nThis is kind of like\n\nputting a meter in front of the guy on the treadmill so he can march at the right rate,\nand stay on the treadmill. So far, we\xe2\x80\x99ve been doing a pretty good job with this new\ntraining program that we\xe2\x80\x99ve got. They do an excellent job of recognizing the different\ntilts of the treadmill and marching at the right pace even without this flight director\nguidance.\n\nI think in terms of time, the next systems that are going to be operational use will be\nground based systems. In fact, LLWAS is already in operation. We\xe2\x80\x99re going to have\nsome discussions about further development of that tool and development of the\nterminal doppler weather radar later on in this symposium.\n\nThese are exciting tools, but what I would like to focus your attention on is this\nbottom bullet on my viewfoil where I get back to what Dave Johnson said earlier, in\nthat it\xe2\x80\x99s a system problem. You\xe2\x80\x99ve got to present information to the crew in such a\nmanner that they can utilize the information. When we talk about what happened in\nDenver on July 11, I\xe2\x80\x99d like you to remember this because there was information there\nthat the crews did not receive the information in a manner that they could operate\non it. So if you could just keep this in mind during those presentations, I think that\xe2\x80\x99s\nthe kind of thing\n\n.. kind of message I\xe2\x80\x99d like to get across.\n\n20\n\nThe big thing, as far as I\xe2\x80\x99m\n\na\n\nconcerned is that the devices on the ground, ought to be able to give us enough\ninformation and I can avoid ever getting to that escape manuever.\n\nThe next tools down the line are the tools that are going to come out of all the work\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s being done here in airborne sensors. Again this is exciting to have the work\nthat\xe2\x80\x99s being done here. We see (we being operational guys in the S7 committee) see\nthis falling into two categories. One set of sensors or some early technology might\ngive us early detection and early escape and the earlier you escape the more treadmill\nyou\xe2\x80\x99ve got to work with, you know, so the less dangerous that escape manuever is.\nAgain, though, what we really need to aim at is to have enough information that we\ncan avoid the problem. In case I haven\xe2\x80\x99t made my point yet, I just have one viewfoil\nthat might emphasize it. (AVOID, AVOID, AVOID IN LARGE LETTERS) That\xe2\x80\x99s\nwhat I\xe2\x80\x99m aiming at.\n\nNow, what are the characteristics of an avoidance tool.\n\nRemember, this has got to be a systems development. We\xe2\x80\x99ve got to work on these\ntools to present the information so that we can use it. I see them as having some\nkind of a situational display that is easy to interpret. I don\xe2\x80\x99t have to spend a lot of\nheads down time. I don\xe2\x80\x99t h\xe2\x80\x99ave to spend a lot of manipulative time. I don\xe2\x80\x99t have to\nwork a lot of dials. It\xe2\x80\x99s a minimum workload. I\xe2\x80\x99m already in an environment during\ntake off or during approach where the workload is heavy. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to have something\nthat is very useful for me. I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to have; time or distance (you know we\xe2\x80\x99re travelling\n3 to 4 miles a minute) I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to have time to come to some decision and try to\ncoordinate that decision with air traffic control and then I\xe2\x80\x99ve got to have information\nthat allows me to pick an avoidance path to get out of this environment so that I can\navoid it all together. So those are the ingredients I think and characteristics of an\navoidance tool.\n\nThank you very much.\n\n21\n\n'
