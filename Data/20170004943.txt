In the embodiment of FIG. 3, the electrodes 310 and 320 are substantially\nplanar.In other embodiments,the electrodes may conform to\nother shapes or configurations such as, but not limited to,\nsemi-circular or angled.\nIn the embodiment of FIG. 3, elongated electro-responsive nanoparticles 330 are dispersed between the first and\nsecond electrodes 310 and 320. Elongated electro-responsive nanoparticles 330 include, but are not limited to,\ncylindrical and prolate spheroid nanorods. In one embodiment,the elongated electro-responsive nanoparticles 330 are\ndispersed in a nonconductive fluid or dispersion agent 340.\nDispersion agents 340 can include, but are not limited to,\nsilicone oil, de-ionized water, glycerol, corn syrup, and any\nother suitable nonconductive fluid. In the embodiment of\nFIG. 3, the elongated electro-responsive nanoparticles 330\nand the dispersion agent 340 is sealed between the first and\nsecond electrodes 310 and 320.\nIn the embodiment of FIG. 3, the first and second electrodes 310 and 320 are substantially parallel and separated\nby a distance equal to or greater than a predefined length of\nthe elongated electro-responsive nanoparticles 330 by spacers 350. For example, spacers with a diameter of about 60\nmicrons may be used with elongated electro-responsive\nnanoparticles 330 with a length up to about 60 microns. In\nother embodiments, the first and second electrodes 310 and\n320 are separated by a distance less than the longest length\nof the elongated electro-responsive nanoparticles 330. In\none embodiment, the spacers 350 are polymethacrylate\nspacers. Other materials suitable for use with the dispersion\nagent 340 and the electrode materials may also be used.\nA voltage is provided to the electrodes 310 and 320 by a\nvoltage supply 360 to establish an electric field between the\nfirst and second electrodes 310 and 320. The voltage supply\n160 can include, but is not limited to, a DC voltage supply,\nan AC voltage supply, or some other switched or controlled\nvoltage supply. In other embodiments, the voltage supply\n360 may be used to establish a magnetic field.\nThe orientation of elongated electro-responsive nanoparticles dispersed between electrodes may be altered by controlling the electric field established between the electrodes.\nFor example, when a DC voltage is applied to the first and\nsecond electrodes 310 and 320 of the embodiment of FIG.\n3, an electric field is established between the first and second\nelectrodes, and extends through the dispersion fluid in\nproximity to the elongated electro-responsive nanoparticles\n330. The direction of the electric field is determined by the\npolarity of the voltage supplied to the first and second\nelectrodes 310 and 320.\nFIG. 4 illustrates an exemplary method 400 for reorienting the stimulus responsive nanoparticles of FIG. 1, according to exemplary embodiments of the present disclosure. In\nblock 410, an electric field is established in proximity to the\nstimulus responsive nanoparticles. With reference to the\n\nexemplary embodiment of FIG. 3, the electric field is\nestablished between the first and second electrodes 310 and\n320. The electric field extends through the dispersion fluid\n340 in proximity to the elongated electro-responsive nanoparticles 330.\nIn response to the established electric field, the stimulus\nresponsive nanoparticles are reoriented in block 420. FIG.5\nillustrates exemplary reorientations of the stimulus responsive nanoparticles included in the stimulus responsive nanoparticle system of FIG. 3, according to one embodiment of\nthe present disclosure. In the exemplary embodiment ofFIG.\n5, in response to establishing the electric field, elongated\nelectro-responsive nanoparticles 520 with a biplaner director\n220 (FIG. 2)rotate 530 to align in parallel with the electric\nfield as illustrated. In alternative embodiments, elongated\nelectro-responsive nanoparticles 510 with a parallel axial\ndirector 210(FIG. 2)translate 540 toward the first electrode\n310, while remaining perpendicular to the electric field.\nOther reorientations may be possible.\nA rotational response of elongated electro-responsive\nnanoparticles 520 may modeled to calculate theoretical\nswitching times.
