The inventions having important use in government programs or significant\ncommercial potential are usually patented by NASA. These inventions cover practically all fields of technology\nand include many that have useful and valuable commercial application.\nNASA inventions best serve the interests of the United States when their benefits are available to the public. In\nmany instances, the granting of nonexclusive or exclusive 1icense.sfor the practice of these inventions may assist\nin the accomplishment of this objective. This bibliography is published as a service to companies, firms, and\nindividuals seeking new, licensable products for the commercial market.\nThe NASA Patent Abstracts Bibliography (NASA PAB) is a semiannual NASA publication containing comprehensive abstracts and indexes of NASA-owned inventions covered by U.S. patents and applications for patent. The\ncitations included in NASA PAB were originally published in NASA\'s Scientific and Technical Aerospace Reports\n(STAR) and cover STAR announcements made since May 1969.\nFor the convenience of the user, each issue of NASA PAB has a separately bound Abstract Section (Section 1)\nand Index Section (Section 2). Although each Abstract Section covers only the indicated six-month period, the\nIndex Section is cumulative covering all NASA-owned inventions announced in STAR since 1969. Thus a complete\nset of NASA PAB would consist of the Abstract Sections of Issue 04 (January 1974) and Issue 12 (January 1978)\nand the Abstract Section for all subsequent issues and the Index Section for the most recent issue.\nThe 63 citations published in this issue of the Abstract Section cover the period July 1989 through December\n1989. The Index Section references over 4600 citations covering the period May 1969 through December 1989.\nABSTRACT SECTION (SECTION 1)\n\nThis PAB issue includes 10 major subject divisions separated into 76 specific categories and one general category/\ndivision. (See Table of Contents for the scope note of each category, under which are grouped appropriate NASA\ninventions.) This scheme was devised in 1975 and revised in 1987 in lieu of the 34 category divisions which were\nutilized in PAB supplements (01) through (06) covering STAR abstracts from May 1969 through January 1974.\nEach entry in the Abstract Section consists of a STAR citation accompanied by an abstract and, when appropriate,\na key illustration taken from the patent or application for patent. Entries are arranged by subject category in order\nof the ascending NASA Accession Number originally assigned for STAR to the invention. The range of NASA\nAccession Numbers within each issue is printed on the inside front cover.\n\nAbstract Citation Data Elements: Each of the abstract citations has several data elements useful for identification\nand indexing purposes, as follows:\nNASA Accession Number\nNASA Case Number\nInventor\'s Name\nTitle of Invention\nU.S. Patent Application Serial Number\nU.S. Patent Number (for issued patents only)\nU.S. Patent Off ice Classification Number(s)\n(for issued patents only)\nThese data elements are identified in the Typical Citation and Abstract and in the indexes.\n\niii\n\nINDEX SECTION (SECTION 2)\n\nI\n\nThe Index Section is divided into five indexes. These indexes are cross-indexed and are used to locate a single\ninvention or groups of inventions.\nSubject Index: Lists all inventions according to appropriate alphabetized technical term and indicates the related\nNASA Case Number, the Subject Category Number, and the Accession Number.\nInventor Index: Lists all inventions according to alphabetized names of inventors and indicates the related NASA\nCase Number, the Subject Category Number, and the Accession Number.\nSource Index: Lists all inventions according to alphabetized source of invention (i.e., name of contractor or\ngovernment installation where invention was made) and indicates the related NASA Case Number, the Subject\nCategory Number, and the Accession Number.\nNumber Index: Lists inventions in order of ascending (1) NASA Case Number, (2) U.S. Patent Application Serial\nNumber, (3) U S . Patent Classification Number, and (4) U.S. Patent Number and indicates the related Subject\nCategory Number and the Accession Number.\nAccession Number Index: Lists all inventions in order of ascending Accession Number and indicates the related\nSubject Category Number, the NASA Case Number, the U.S. Patent Application Serial Number, the U S . Patent\nClassification Number, and the U.S. Patent Number.\nHOW TO USE THIS PUBLICATION TO IDENTIFY NASA INVENTIONS\n\nTo identify one or more NASA inventions within a specific technical field or subject, several techniques are possible\nwith the flexibility incorporated into the NASA PAB.\n(1) Using Subject Category: To identify all NASA inventions in any one of the subject categories in this\nissue of NASA PAB, select the desired Subject Category in the Abstract Section (Section 1) and find the\ninventions abstracted thereunder.\n\n(2) Using Subject Index: To identify all NASA inventions listed under a desired technical subject index\nterm, (A) turn to the cumulative Subject Index in the Index Section and find the invention(s) listed under\nthe desired technical subject term. (B) Note the indicated Accession Number and the Subject Category\nNumber. (C) Using the indicated Accession Number, turn to the inside front cover of the Index Section to\ndetermine which issue of the Abstract Section includes the Accession Number desired. (D) To find the\nabstract of the particular invention in the issue of the Abstract Section selected, (1) use the Subject\nCategory Number to locate the Subject Category and (2) use the Accession Number to locate the desired\ninvention within the Subject Category listing.\n\n( 3 ) Using Patent Classification Index: To identify all inventions covered by issued NASA patents (not\nincluding applications for patent) within a desired Patent Classification, (A) turn to the Patent Classification\nNumber in the Number Index of Section 2 and find the associated invention(s), and (B) follow the instructions outlined in (2)(B), and (D) above.\n\nTYPICAL CITATION AND ABSTRACT\nNASASPONSORED\n\nACCESSION NUMBER -N89-12621;\nNational Aeronautics and !:pace\nAdministration.\nLyndon 6.\nJohnson Space Center, Houston, TX. 4\nTITLE -SPACE\nSTATION ERECTABLE MANIPULATOR PLACEMENT\n\nSYSTEM Patent\nINVENTO-MARGARET\nE.

A suitable manipulating\nsystem having extraordinary manipulative capability is required. The\ninvention is an erectable manipulator placement system for use on\na space station and comprises an elongate, lattice-like boom having\nguide tracks attached thereto, a carriage-like assembly pivotally\nmounted on and extending from said dolly. \'The system further includes a turntable base pivotally interconnected with the proximal\nend of the boom and positioned either on a part of a transferring\nvehicle, or on another payload component being carried by the said\ntransferring vehicle, or on the space station. Novelty resides in the\nuse of a turntable base having a hinged boom with a dolly translatable\ntherealongto carry the arm-likeassembly, thus providingan additional\n3 degrees of freedom to the arm.\nOfficial Gazette of the US.

The available and predicted thrusts are based\non the performance of a functional model of the aircraft engine\nunder the same operating conditions.

A fiber optic cable connects the\nreference unit to the remote unit. A frequency source at the\nreference unit produces a reference frequency having an adjustable\nphase. A fiber optic transmitter at the reference unit modulates a\nlight beam with the reference frequency and transmits the light\nbeam into the fiber optic cable. A 50/50 reflector at the remote\nunit reflects a first portion of the light beam from the reference\nunit back into the fiber optic cable to the reference unit.

A phase\nconjugator is connected to the frequency source for comparing\nthe phase of the reference frequency component to the phase of\nthe reference frequency modulating the light beam being\ntransmitted from the reference unit to maintain a conjugate\n(anti-symmetric) relationship between the reference frequency\ncomponent and the reference frequency modulating the light beam\nwhere virtually no phase difference exists between the phase of\nthe reference frequency component and the phase of the reference\n\n76 SOLID-STATE PHYSICS\nfrequency modulating the light beam.\nNASA\n\nsuperconductor.
