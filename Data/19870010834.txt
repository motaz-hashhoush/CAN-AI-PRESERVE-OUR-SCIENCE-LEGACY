Mularz\nPropulsion Directorate\nU.S. Army Aviation Research and Technology Actlvlty-AVSCOM\nNASA Lewis Research Center\nCleveland, Ohio\n\nAt the NASA Lewis Research Center, combustion research is being conducted\nin the Internal Fluid Mechanics Division.\nThe research is organized into three\nmain functions focusing on the fluid dynamics related to aeropropulslon\nsystems\n(fig. l).\nThe first function, computational methods, looks at improved algorithms and new computational fluid dynamic techniques to solve Internal flow\nproblems, including heat transfer and chemical reactions.\nThls area also looks\nat using expert systems and parallel processing as they might be applied to\nsolving internal flow problems.\nThe second function is fundamental experiments.\nThese experiments can\ngenerate benchmark data in support of computational models and numerical codes,\nor they can focus on the physical phenomena of interest to obtain a better\nunderstanding\nof the physics or chemistry involved as a preamble to models and\ncomputer codes.\nComputational\napplications is the third function in the Internal Fluid\nMechanics Division.\nNew flow codes are validated against available experimental data, and they are used as a tool to investigate performance of real\nengine hardware.\nSince the geometry may be quite complex for the system being\nanalyzed, large grids and computer storage may be required.\nThe hardware of\ninterest includes combustion chambers, high-speed inlets, and turbomachlnery\ncomponents (e.g., a centrifugal compressor).\nThe goal of this research is to bring computational\nfluid dynamics to a\nstate of practical application for the aircraft engine industry.\nAs shown in\nfigure 2, the approach is to have a strongly integrated computational\nand\nexperimental program for all the disciplines associated with the gas turbine\nand other aeropropulslon\nsystems by advancing the understanding\nof flow\nphysics, heat transfer, and combustion processes.\nThe computational\nand\nexperimental\nresearch is integrated In the following way:\nthe experiments that\nare performed provide an emplrlcal data set so that physical models can be\nformulated to describe the processes that are occurring - for example, turbulence or chemical reaction.\nThese experiments also form a data base for those\nwho are doing code development by providing experimental data against which\nthe codes can be verified and assessed.\nModels are generated as closure to\nsome of the numerical codes, and they also provide physical insight for experiments.\nAt the same time, codes which solve the complete Navler-Stokes\nequations can be used as a kind of numerical experiment from which far more\nextensive data can be obtained than ever could be obtained experimentally.\nThis could provide physical insight into the complex processes that are taking\nplace.\nThese codes are also exercised against experimental data to assess the\naccuracy and applicability\nof models (e.g., the turbulence model).\nWe feel\nthat a fully integrated computatlonal-experlmental\nresearch program Is more\nproductive than other approaches and that It is the most desirable way of\npursuing our goal.\n\nFigure 3 is a cutaway view of a hypothetical combustor which illustrates\nthe typical complex fluid mechanics and combustion features.\nThe flows are\nhighly three-dlmenslonal with turbulence levels, in many cases, comparable in\nmagnitude to the bulk velocity.\nLiquid fuels are injected as a spray which\nthen undergoes vaporization and mixing. The chemical reaction which occurs\ncauses changes in density and fluid mechanics properties and can cause the\nformation of a solid phase (soot) with its attendant hlgh-radlatlon heat\ntransfer.\nAn understanding of these physical processes is needed before\naccurate numerical codes can be built and used as a predictive tool in the\ndesign process. In addition, the numerical methods for three-dlmenslonal\nflows need improvements in accuracy and efficiency in order to properly\nsimulate the features of these flows.\nThis then is the framework of the combustion research program. As shown\nin figure 4, the program is divided into four elements:\nadvanced numerics,\nfuel sprays, fluid mixing, and radiation chemistry.\nThe research in each of\nthese elements is focused on the long-range objective of developing numerical\ncodes that can be used as a predictive tool to describe both two- and threedimensional flows.\nOnce the codes can be used with confidence,\nindustry will\nbe able to integrate them into their combustor design system.\nBefore discussing the specific research currently taking place, I would\nlike to describe the major computing hardware now being used at NASA Lewis to\ncompute reacting internal flows. Lewis currently has a CRAY 1-S computer which\nis tied to an IBM 370 system for Input/output.\nIt has a relatively small\nstorage capacity, but a very hlgh calculation speed.\nIn the near future a\nCRAY X-MP will be installed (fig. 5).\nIt will replace the CRAY l-S and will\nprovide a modest increase in computer speed.\nCore storage, however, will\nincrease dramatically from 2 million words to 36 million words, and a highspeed solld-state device, which is practically equivalent to core memory, will\nalso be included.\nIn addition, the new equipment will have two processors\nwhich will give Lewis some ability to start using algorithms that can take\nadvantage of simultaneous processing and thus increase the computation speed\neven further.\nIn addition to the computers located at Lewis, NASA is building a "super\ncomputer" at its Ames Research Center called the Numerical Aerodynamic\nSimulator (NAS) (fig. 6).\nThe NAS computer will be accessed at both NASA\nLangley and NASA Lewis through satellite linkage with a UNIX operating system.\nIn its current configuration, the NAS computer is a CRAY 2 with 256 megawords\nof memory, which will enable it to make very large calculations of chemically\nreacting internal fluid flows.\nIt will have four processors.\nIn addition, as\nthe state-of-the-art\nof computers advances changes will be made in the NAS\ncomputer to reflect these advances.\nThe current research in combustion can be summarized in six major activities.\nThe first actlvlty is called improved numerical methods for complex\nI\n\nIUW_.\n\nIIUIII_I\n\nIbal\n\n_l\n\nI Ul\n\nI_\n\na\n\nUI_\n\n_1UUI_III\n\nWILII\n\nLII_\n\nbU!\n\nI_IIL\n\nIIUIII_I\n\nI_OI\n\n_UU_3.\n\nThis numerical\nerror must be reduced before\nthe accuracy\nof physical\nmodels can\nbe assessed.\nThe grids\nused in calculations\nthat\nare performed\nwith\nstate-ofthe-art\ncodes are very sensitive\nto the flow\ndirection\nrelative\nto that\ngrid,\nand at high angles\nthis\nsensitivity\nleads to serious\nnumerical\nerrors.\nTechniques to reduce numerical\ndiffusion,\nor error,\nand to virtually\neliminate\nit\nfrom calculations\nare being pursued.\nWork is also underway to establish\nsecond-order\naccurate\nclosure\nmodels\nfor turbulent\nreacting\nflow.\n\nThe second activity\nInvolves\nthe development\nof techniques\nfor making\npredictive\ncalculations\nof chemically\nreacting\nflow.\nOne of the more promising\ntechniques,\nwhich\nis really\nIn tts\ninfancy,\nis called\ndirect\nnumerical\nslmulatlons,\nor DNS.\nIn this\ntechnique,\nthe Navler-Stokes\nequations\nare solved\ndlrectly\nwithout\nany modeling\nof the turbulence.\nThis technique\nis currently\nbeing applied\nto reacting\nshear layers.\nAlthough\nthis\nIs a relatively\nsimple\nflow,\nthere\nis nevertheless\na lo\xc2\xb1 of complexity\nassociated\nwith\nit.\nMuch work\nremains to be done with\nthis\ntechnique,\nbut the results\nto date have been very\npromising.\nAnother technique that has been used In several kinds of flows Is called\nthe random vortex method.\nThis technique accounts for the vortlclty generated\nat the wall of the confined flow and solves the vortlclty equation without any\nturbulence closure modeling.\nCalculated results of flow over a rearward\nfacing step show many of the characteristics\nseen In hlgh-speed movies of\nturbulent reacting flow experiments.\nThe third activity involves benchmark experiments for code development\nand\nverification.\nTwo-phase flow research Is currently underway.\nDetailed data\nare required for code assessment, and instruments which Lewis has helped to\ndevelop now show much promise of being able to make the appropriate measurements.\n(Those instruments are also being used to support icing research.)\nResearch is also being conducted on numerical calculation of two-phase flow.\nWlth the data from the experiments, an assessment of the current code capability wlll be made to guide future code development efforts.\nIn addition, an\nextensive set of experiments is being conducted to look at the mixing of\ndilution Jets into a cross stream in a channel.\nA substantial range of parametric variables has been studied, and a Very complete set of data has been\nestablished.\nThe next activity Is computer code applications.\nCurrently available\ncodes are applied to real systems.\nThe study of flow In the transition section of a reverse flow combustor is an example of such work.\nHere a flow In\nwhich fuel has already been burned has to undergo a 180 \xc2\xb0 annular turn.\nVery\nstrong secondary flows arise, and the analysis Is very complex.\nAnother\nexample Is the application of the Lewls-developed general chemical kinetics\nprograms and chemical equilibrium codes to problems of practical interest.\nThese codes are used throughout the world.\nThe next activity Is code development for thermochemlcal\nproperties and\nklnetlc rates.\nThermodynamic\ncalculations for real gases are being performed\nIn support of future combustion models.\nThe modeling of chemical kinetic computations for complex reactions Is also being actively developed In support of\nfuture computer codes.\nThe final activity In the current combustion research program Is to\nadvance the understanding\nof chemical mechanisms In reacting flow.\nChemical\nkinetic rates are measured using a shock tube facility.\nThe data from thls\nexperiment are used to assess the kinetic models for various fuels of interest\nIn aeropropulslon\nsystems.\nDetailed characteristics\nof one- and two-dlmensional controlled flames are also being established.\nWe are interested in\nstudying the behavior of some of the minor species of flames and In looking at\nthe soot nucleation growth and eventual soot consumption\nin flames.\nRadiation\nheat transfer Is dominant In combustors and other aeropropulslon\nsystems.\nThe\ncontrol of soot nucleation and growth is essential if radiation heat transfer\n3\n\nis to be reduced. Also, some of the minor intermediates o f combustion are\nbeing measured in an attempt to understand the detailed physics involved in\nflame fronts.\n\nBENCHMARK EXPERl MENTS\n\nCOMPUTATIONAL METHODS\n\nA PPL ICAT I ONS\nFigure 1 - Fundamental aeropropulsion computational and experimental research in\n.\nthe internal fluid mechanics division.\n\nNUMERICAL\n\nEXPERIMENTS\n\nINSIGHT\nMODELING\n\nDEVELOPMENT\n\nNUMERICAL\nCLOSURE\n\n-\n\nCD-5-IMI\n\nFigure 2 Integrated computational-experimental methodology for propulsion\n.\naerothermodynamics research.

Zhang\nand H.H. Chlu, University of Illinois at Chlcago, 1984)) is to present mathematical models and numerical methods for combustor flows and to apply these\nmethods to the computer prediction of aeroenglne afterburner characteristics.\nThe long-ignored droplet-turbulent-dlffuslon\nmodel plays an important role\nin droplet dispersion and species distribution.\nIt has now been incorporated\nin this modeling.\nThe K-c turbulence model is modified and extended to account\nfor multlphase turbulence effects.\nA hybrid, finlte-rate\nchemlcal-reaction\nmodel based on a global Arrhenlus law and a turbulent mlxlng-rate model is used\nJudiciously to predict the combustion rate of multlphase premlxed turbulent\nflames.\nA system of conservation equations of the Eulerlan type is used for\nboth gaseous flow and multlslzed droplet flow predictions.\nTo solve these\nequations, the authors developed a computer code called GEMCHIP (general,\nelllptlc-type,\nmultlphase, combustion-heat-transfer,\nand Interdlffuslon\nprogram), in which the SIMPLER algorithm (ref. 3) for gaseous flow prediction\n\nand the DROPLET\n(private communication with X. Zhou and H.H. Chlu, University\nof Illinois\nat Chicago, IgB3) procedure for droplet flow calculation were\nincorporated.\nThe block correction technique and the alternatlng-dlrectlon\nreclprocatlng-sweep llne-by-llne\nTDMA\n(trl-dlagonal\nmatrix algorithm) method\nwas adopted to facilitate\nconvergence of the iteration processes.\nThe afterburner under study is a Iow-bypass-ratlo turbofan engine augmentor of the axlsymmetrlc type with a bluff body flameholder.\nThe method of\nsimulating the irregularly shaped flow domain and the flameholder configuration\nis described briefly and the inlet and boundary conditions are presented.\nThe\nusual wall functions (ref. 4) are used to bridge the near wall regions where\nlocal Reynolds numbers are very low.\nThe numerical results of gas flow, droplet flow fields, and the spray\nflame structures are presented.\nA study of the parametric sensitivity of the\ncombustion efficiency is made for both gas combustion and multlphase combustion.\nEngineering guides are given for afterburner design optimization.\n\nSYMBOLS\nCp\n\nspecific\n\nheat of gas at constant\n\nE\n\nactivation\n\nh\n\ntotal enthalpy\n\nJ\n\nwork-heat\n\nequivalence\n\nK\n\nturbulent\n\nkinetic\n\nL\n\nlatent heat of vaporization\n\nP\n\ngas pressure\n\nq\n\nheat value of fuel\n\nRu\n\nuniversal\n\nr_\n\ndroplet\n\nT\n\ntemperature\n\nU,V\n\nvelocities\n\nW\n\nmolecular\n\nY\n\nspecies\n\nr\n\ngamma function;\n\ny\n\nstolchlometrlc\n\npressure\n\nenergy\n\nenergy\n\ngas constant\n\nradius\n\nin X and R directions,\n\nrespectively\n\nweight\n\nmass concentration\ntransport\ncoefficient\n\ncoefficient\n\nturbulence\nk\n\nheat\n\ndlsslpatlon\n\nrate\n\nconductivity\n\nviscosity\np\n\ndensity\nmixture\n\nfraction\n\nNondlmenslonal\n\nnumbers:\n\nD1\n\nfirst Damkohler\n\nEc\n\nEckert\n\nEu\n\nEulerlan\n\nGc\n\nspray group combustion\n\nGd\n\nspray group aerodynamic\n\nGv\n\nspray group droplet\n\nLmk\n\nmass\n\nNu\n\nNusselt\n\nPe\n\nPeclet\n\nPr\n\nPrandtl\n\nRe\n\nReynolds\n\nSc\n\nSchmldt\n\n_TR\n\nratio of flow\n\nCR\n\nratio of turbulent\n\no\n\nnumber\n\nnumber\nnumber\n\nfraction\n\nnumber\ndrag number\n\npreheating\n\nof liquid\n\nnumber\n\nIn the mixture\n\nnumber\nnumber\nnumber\nnumber\nnumber\n\nturbulent\n\nresidence\n\ntlme to turbulence\n\nkinetic\n\nSchmldt/Prandtl\n\nenergy to mean\nnumber\n\nSubscripts:\nb\n\nboiling\n\neff\n\neffective\n\nF\n\nfuel\n\ng\n\ngas\n\nk\n\nKth slze group of droplets\n\npoint\n\nliquid\n9\n\ndissipation\nflow value\n\ntlme\n\nM,m\n\nmean\n\no\n\ninitial\n\nox\n\noxygen\n\nP\n\nproduct\n\nT,t\n\nturbulent;\n\nor inlet condition\n\ntemperature\n\nMATHEMATICAL\n\nFORMULATION\n\nThe Eulerlan scheme is used to construct elllptlc-type\nconservation\nequations for both gaseous and droplet phases in two-dlmenslonal,\nmultlphase,\ncombustlng, turbulent flows.\nNondlmenslonallzatlon\nof these equations leads\nto the following two general forms (ref. l and private communication\nwith X.\nZhou and H.H.

the Arrhenlus law, the latter rate is calculated from the eddybreak-up (EBU) model\n\nRF =-\n\nmlR_RF,EBU.,\n\n.RF,Ar _\n\n(ll)\n\nwhere\n\n+i\n\n:\n_2\nRF,Ar = -BaTgpgYFYox\n\nNUMERICAL\n\nexp (-E/RuTg)\n\nMETHODS\n\nA 42 by 38 staggered grid system is superimposed on the flow domain.\nThe\npreviously mentioned two general forms of nonlinear partial differential equations are then dlscretlzed into their finite difference counterparts by using\nthe control volume scheme and the primitive variables of pressure and velocity.\nThe power law scheme (ref. 3) is adopted to determine combined diffusion/\nconvection fluxes.\nThe SIMPLER procedure is employed to predict gaseous flow\nfields, it reduces computer time by 30 to 50 percent in comparison with the\npopular SIMPLE procedure.\nThe DROPLET procedure is used for calculating droplet flow fields.\nThe alternatlng-directlon\ndouble-reclprocatlng-sweep\nllneby-line TDMA method is adopted to solve simultaneous algebraic equations Iteratlvely.\nThe block correction technique is used to facilitate convergence.\nThe usual wall function method is employed to bridge the near wall regions\nwhere the laminar viscosity effect is quite strong.\nThis method is very effective in greatly reducing computer time while obtaining rather satisfactory\nresults.\nAll these methods have been assembled into the computer code GEMCHIP.\nThe main flow chart of GEMCHIP is shown in figure I.\nA droplet-free solution is first obtained through SIMPLER, which provides\nboth final results for the single gas-phase flow and the initial guesses of the\ngas flow fields for muitiphase flow.\nThen we enter DROPLET to calculate droplet flow fields and the Interphase exchanges of mass, momentum, and energy.\nThese quantities are substituted as source terms into SIMPLER, and the gas flow\nfields are modified.\nThen we enter DROPLET again.\nThis alternating Iteratlve\nprocess continues until all the gas- and droplet-flow\nequations satisfy the\nconvergence criterion in all grids.\nThe typical iteration number ranges from\n40 to 75 for gas-phase burning problems and from 120 to 150 for multlphase\nburning problems.\nThe corresponding\ncomputer times are about 5 and 30 mln,\nrespectively,\non an IBM 4342 machine.\n12\n\n-\n\nTHE AFTERBURNER\n\nSTUDIED\n\nFigure 2 shows a Iow-bypass-ratlo\nturbofan afterburner In which the computer modeling is made.\nThe afterburner consists of a cone-type dlffuser/mIxer,\na cylindrical combustion section, and a slngle-rlng bluff-body flameholder.\nA\ncylindrical partition board separates the cold fan flow from the hot core flow.\nThe temperature and velocity are 350 K and BO m/sec in the fan flow and 600 to\n800 K and 60 to 200 m/sec In the core flow.\nThe liquid fuel Is evenly In_ected\nin spray form into the core flow, and then the droplets are heated, vaporized,\nmixed, and combusted with oxygen in the airflow.\n\nHandling\n\nof Irregularly\n\nShaped\n\nWall and Flameholder\n\nThe curved afterburner wall and the flameholder are simulated by blocking\noff some of the control volumes of the regular grld system so that the remaining active control volumes form the desired shape.\nThe advantage of thls\nmethod is that a computer code developed for the nominally regular domain can\nbe adapted to flows of arbitrarily shaped configurations\nso that there is no\nneed to generate new programs and the time for developing and testing such\nprograms is saved.\nThe irregular boundary can be represented approximately\nby a series of\nrectangular\nsteps (fig. 3).\nUsually a rather crude representation\nof the\nboundary can produce surprisingly good results.\nThe values of the relevant flow parameters should be given in the blockedoff regions.\nThis is done by using extremely large source terms or by assigning extremely large transport coefficients in these inactive control volumes.\nThese inactive grids also participate in the iteration process.\n\nBoundary\n\nConditions\n\nAppropriate boundary conditions are selected to represent the wall regions\nof the afterburner.\nThe following assumptions can be realistically made with\nregard to this kind of selection:\n(1) No sllp at the wall\n(2) Zero turbulent fluctuation at the wall\n(3) Adiabatic and impermeable wall\nIt is reported that the predicted solution Is very sensitive to the inlet\nconditions.\nFor this reason, the inlet profiles should conform to measured\nvalues whenever available.\nUnfortunately, measurements\nof the profiles of the\ninlet variables, especially the inlet velocity vectors and the inlet turbulence\nvariables\nK and\nc, are seldom carried out in complex geometries.\nIt is,\ntherefore, reasonable to assume the following profiles (ref. 6):\n\nUg = Ugo(1 - F) n\nV\n\n=0\ng\n\n13\n\n1.5\nc = co (K/Ko)\nwhere 0.2 > n > 0 and 2 > m > O. The variables with subscript o denote\nvalues at the centers of cote fTow or fan flow. The nondlmenslonal radius\nT = r/R for the core flow and T = Ir - (R l + Ro)/21/((R1 + Ro)/2) for the\nflow, where\nRo denotes the radius\nthe diffuser\'s inlet radius.\n\nof the partition\n\nboard\n\nand\n\nRl\n\nfan\nrepresents\n\nThe inlet profiles of the droplet number densities, temperatures,\nvelocities vary wlth the fuel nozzle type and spray quality.\n\nand\n\nIn the axis of symmetry the radial gradients\nables are taken to be equal to zero.\n\nvari-\n\nof all droplet-phase\n\nThe exit plane should be located far downstream and outside the reclrculatlon zone so that the local parabolic flow assumption applies and that the\ncalculating domain is isolated from the ambient environment.\nThe only exceptions are the equations for pressure\np and for the pressure correction parameter\np\', since the pressure effect is always two way.\nThe problem is solved\nby calculating the outlet velocity component in the main flow direction.\n\nRESULTS\n\nAND DISCUSSIONS\n\nThe objectives of the numerical study are to analyze the shape and the\nsize of reclrculatlon zones at different working conditions, to examine the\nvaporization process of multlslze fuel sprays, to compare the multlphase flame\nstructures with the gas flame structures, and to study the parametric sensitivity of afterburnlng efficiency.\n\nReclrculation\n\nZones\n\nThe gas velocity vector fields inside the afterburner are shown in\nfigures 4 to 6 for gas flow and multlphase flow.\nThe numerical calculations\nreveal that the reclrculatlon\nzones in the wake of the flameholder are induced\nby negative\n\npressure gradients,\n\nwhich,\n\nin turn, are caused\n\nby gaseous\n\nviscosity.\n\nFigures 4 and 5 are pictures of velocity vectors and X-dlrectlon velocity\ncomponent profiles in a gas phase flow.\nThe length of the reclrculatlon\nzone\nin the cold flow case is about 2.0 to 3.5 times the flameholder width.\nIt Is\nreadily seen from figure 4 and 5 that the wake effect still exists far downstream of the flameholder.\nSome experimental\nreports claim that the reclrculatlon zone wlll uuLu,,_ larger and longer In gas combustlu,, _ases u=_=u_: of gas\nexpansion and the reduction of the absolute value of the negative pressure\nbehind the flameholder.\nBut this trend is not obvious in this calculation.\nResearch work is under way in thls direction.\nFigure 7 shows droplet velocity vectors of two size groups in the multiphase afterburnlng condition.\nA comparison of the multlphase flow with the\ngas flow field (fig. 6) shows that the small droplets are capable of reaching\n14\n\nvelocity\nequilibrium\nmore qutckly\nthan the large droplets.\nThe velocity\nnonequilibrium\nIn the downstream Is somewhat enhanced because the gas is accelerated more rapldly\nthan the droplets.\nThis is especlally\ntrue\nfor the large\ndroplets.\nThe droplet\nreclrculatlon\nzone Is obviously\nsmaller\nthan the gas\nreclrculatton\nzone.\n\nCascading\n\nVaporization\n\nThe preheating and vaporization processes of droplets of different slze\ngroups are illustrated In figure 8. It Is readily seen from the predicted\ncurves that the small droplets (e.g., D1 = 0.15) complete the preheating\nprocess and initiate the vaporization process much earlier than the large\ndroplets (e.g., Dl = 1.60).\nThe phenomenon of successive initiation of the vaporization of droplets\nof different sizes In spray Is designated as cascading vaporization (ref. l)\nsince the initial vaporization\nlines of different slze droplets constitute a\nform of cascade.\n\nGas Flame and Multlphase\n\nFlame\n\nStructures\n\nFigures g(a) and (b) show the temperature field and flame structure of\nthe gas combustion flow.\nThe gas flame structure Is rather simple:\nthe flow\nof the combustible mixture mixes wlth the fan flow of the cold alr, and the\nflame Is stabilized In the reclrculatlon zone close behind the flameholder.\nThere Is a "dark" area, which Is fuel-deflclent,\nIn the wake of the flameholder.\nThls Is where the combustion Is completed.\nThe structure of the multlphase flame Is very complicated.\nCalculation\nreveals that there are three principal combustion modes:\n(1) pre-evaporatlng\nflame, (2) dense spray group flame, and (3) dilute spray group flame.\nThe\ntotal fuel-alr ratio and the spray group combustion number\nGc are the two\nmaln parameters determining combustion mode.\nThe\nGc\nIs actually the ratio\nof the characteristic\nvaporization rate to the convection flow rate and was\nfirst proposed by Prof. H.H. Chlu (ref. 7).\nPre-evaporatlng\nflame. - The pre-evaporatlon\nflame Is shown In figure lO.\nWhen the\nGc number Is very large (fine atomization,\ni.e., the spray consists of an extremely large quantity of small droplets) all the droplets are\nvaporized at a typical afterburner\ninlet temperature\nbefore they get to the\nflame zone.\nThe flame structure Is similar to that of gas phase combustion.\nDense spray qroup flame. - If the Gc\nnumber Is rather large and the\nfuel-air ratio Is also high, dense spray group combustion occurs (fig. ll);\nthls Is characterized\nby the presence of an oxygen-deflclent\nzone, which\ndecreases combustion efficiency.\nBoth types of gas and droplet burning coexist\nin the flame.\nDilute spray qroup flame. - Thls,mode occurs at a small\nGc number, which\nIs characterized\nby poor atomization quality and a low fuel-alr ratio:\nthat\nIs, there Is a small quantity of blg droplets.\nIf the droplet slze Is large\nenough and droplets concentrate near the central llne of the afterburner, the\nv-type flame shown In figure 12 may appear.\nThls type of flame Is unstable.\n15\n\nFigures 13(a) and (b) show, respectively, the axial distributions\nof\nafterburnlng efflclencles in gas-phase and multlphase combustion cases. It is\nseen that the growth of the combustion efficiency for the multlphase flame has\na slower start than that for the gas flame. This difference is caused by the\ndroplet preheating and by vaporization processes. The results also indicate\nthat the smaller the spray group combustion number G the larger the\nc,\ndifference.\nParametric Sensitivity\n\nStudy of Combustion Efficiency\n\nFigure 14 showsthe effect of fuel-alr ratio on gas-phase combustion efficiency at two different pressures (2.0 kg/cm2 and 0.5 kg/cm2). The efflclency curve reaches its peak at an approximately stolchlometrlc fuel-alr\nratio\nin the core flow. At higher pressures, the efficiency peak movestoward richer\nm_xtures and the curve becomesflatter because of the dilution action by the\nfan flow and the improvement of combustion conditions.\nFigure 15 showsthe variation of the multlphase combustion efficiency with\nthe fuel-air ratio at two different spray group combustion numbers. With\nmultlphase combustion there is a combustion efficiency peak at an appropriate\nfuel-alr ratio similar to that with gas-phase combustion. With an increase of\nG number, the efficiency peak movestoward leaner mixtures - which means\nc\nmixtures with a larger number of smaller-slzed droplets will have a higher combustion efficiency at a lower fuel-alr\nratio.\nThe results are also in agreement with the experimental measurements.\nFigures 16(a) and (b) showthe effect of the inlet gas temperature on combustion efflclencles of gas-phase and multlphase flames. The temperature\nincrease enhancesthe heat release rate and speeds up droplet vaporization,\nwhich, in turn, enhancesthe combustion efficlencles\nof both the gas and multiphase flames. But, for obvious reasons, the temperature effect is stronger in\nmultlphase flames.\nThe effect of inlet gas pressure on combustion efficiency is similar to\nthat of inlet temperature.\nIt is seen from figure 14 that, in the case of gas\nphase combustion, an increase of gas pressure from 0.5 to 2.0 kg/cm 2 significantly improves combustion.\nFigure 17 shows the increase of combustion\nefficiency with gas pressure in a multiphase combustion case.\nThe pressure\neffect is negligible at pressures greater than 1.3 kg/cm 2.\nFigure 18 shows the effect of gas-flow velocity on gas-phase combustion\nefficiency.\nAn increase in ga s velocity results in a decrease in combustion\nefficiency because of the reduction of the residence time of the gas flow in\nthe afterburner.\nThe higher the velocity, the lower the efficiency.\nThe\neffect of inlet gas velocity on multlphase combustion efficiency is rather\ncnmnllr_fpdr\n........................ v_Inri_y\n_Inr_\nth_\n\nthe droplet\n\natomization,\n\n_,.__r\xc3\xb7_\n\nvaporization,\n\nnnt,,v_nlv,,,y h_,,__ac_anr_,\n\xc3\xb7\n_,_,,_\n\nand spray\n\ngroup\n\n\xc3\xb7_m_,,.,_\n_h"_\n\ncombustion\n\nalc_\n\nnumber\n\nGc.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe mathematical models and numerical methods for predicting multlphase\nturbulent reacting flows, developed in the authors\' study of spray group combustion phenomena have been successfully extended and applied to the numerical\n16\n\nstudy of flow fields\nand combustion\ncharacteristics\nof a low-bypass-ratio\nturbofan\nafterburner.\nThe computer\ncode developed\nby the authors\nIs versatile\nand effective\nIn thls\nstudy.\nThe technique\nof blocking\noff relevant\ncontrol\nvolumes makes It posslble\nfor a computer code developed\nfor a regular\ngrid\nsystem to be applied\nto arbitrary\nflow domains.\nThe numerical\nanalysls\nreveals\nthat\nthe size of the rectrculation\nzone\nbehind the flameholder\nis about 2.0 to 3.5 times\nIts width.\nThe droplet\nreclrculatlon\nzone Is smaller\nthan the gas reclrculatton\nzone and decreases\nor even\ndisappears\nwith\nan increase\nIn droplet\nsize.\nThe calculation\nalso exposes the existence\nof three\nprincipal\ncombustion\nmodes In multlphase\ncombustion.\nThey are the pre-evaporatlng\nflame mode, the\ndense spray group flame mode, and the dilute\nspray group flame mode.\nStudy of\nflame structure\nIs useful\nto afterburner\ndesign optimization.\nThe results\nreveal\nthe dependence of afterburner\ncombustion\nefficiency\non\nthe fuel-alr\nratio\nand on the operating\nparameters\n(such as the Inlet\ngas temperature,\npressure,\nand velocity).\nAs for multlphase\ncombustion,\nwhich\nprevails\nin turbofan\nafterburners,\nthe spray group combustion\nnumber has a\nsignificant\neffect\non combustion\nefficiency\nand flame structure.\nIt Is concluded that\nafterburners\nshould be designed to work In the optimum spray group\ncombustion\nnumber, which\nis related\nto the fuel-air\nratio\nand Its distribution.\nGenerally\nspeaking,\nthe favorable\ndesign has a pre-evaporatlng\nflame mode or a\ndense group combustion\nmode with\nan Initial\nfuel\ndistribution\ncapable\nof keeplng oxygen-deflclent\nzones as small as possible.\nAlthough\nthe previously\npredicted\nresults\nare In good qualitative\nagreement with\nthe known facts,\naccurate\ndlagnostlc\nmeasurements\nand detailed\nexperimental\nverifications\nare necessary\nto examine the quantitative\nagreement\nand to improve\nthe present\nmodels.\n\nREFERENCES\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\no\n\nChlu, H.H.;

Claus\nNASA Lewis Research Center\nCleveland,\n\nOhio\n\nThis paper examines several of the approximations\nor models involved in\nthe development\nof a numerical combustor flow code.\nIn the first section, the\nimportance of numerical accuracy is illustrated, and the impact that improvedaccuracy schemes have on slowing convergence is demonstrated.\nSolution algorithms that can speed convergence are discussed and some performance features\nof these algorithms are illustrated.\nA sample calculation displaying the\nimportance of boundary conditions on a three-dlmenslonal\nnumerical prediction\nis presented.\nThe inaccuracy of a current turbu]ence model in highly turbulent (nonequlllbrlum)\nregions is described.\nFinally, the surprisingly good\nperformance of a slx-flux model in descrlblng radiation heat transfer Is dlsplayed.\nIn all the areas examined, continued research is still needed, but\nvaluable engineering tools are available today.\nINTRODUCTION\nThree-dlmenslonal\ncombustor calculatlons involve detailed modeling of\nseveral important physical processes.\nAirflow, chemical reactions, fuel\nsprays, and turbulence are Just a few of the physical processes that must be\ndescribed.\nMany of these processes occur on both a molecular and a macroscopic scale.\nTo exactly describe these processes numerically, one must\nresolve these scales on a computational mesh.\nAnd this is clearly beyond\ncurrent computational\nresources.\nTo make the computational\ntask tractable,\nwe introduced modeling assumptions.\nThese modeling assumptions\nlimit the\ngenerality of the computational\nflow code, but It Is hoped that the dominant\nphysics remain correctly represented.\nModeling assumptions are only the first limit of generality introduced\nwhen developing a combustor flow code.\nA further limit Is introduced by the\nneed to approximate the modeled equations before they are solved numerically.\nThls approximation\nprocess can significantly affect the accuracy of a model\nprediction.\nIn vlew of all these factors, a combustor designer cannot be expected to\nfully embrace a computer model prediction.\nIf a clear distinction\nbetween\nmodeling errors and errors introduced by the numerical solution algorithm cannot be made, then the designer is left wlth a very unreliable computational\ntool.\nThls paper examines some of the compromises made when developing combustor flow codes and how these compromises affect the accuracy of turbulent flow\ncalculations.\nTo assess the balance of the modeling compromises, we compare a\nnumber of sample calculations wlth experimental data.\nThis paper examines the\nflve areas of numerical accuracy, solution algorithms, inlet boundary conditions, turbulence models, and radiative heat transfer.\n\n31\n\nThe NUMERICAL\nACCURACY\nsection focuses on the development of more accurate numerical methods to be used In combustor flow codes. Upwind differencing, which Is currently used in these flow codes, introduces an appreciable\nerror (or numerical diffusion) Into the calculation.\nThis error may be of\nsuch a large magnitude that It obscures the turbulence model used In the calculation.\nA series of calculations are illustrated\nwhich demonstrate the\naccuracy of a variety of differencing schemes.\nAn important\naspect\nof improved\naccuracy\nis the effect\nthat\nthe differencing\nscheme has on the rate of convergence.\nThe improved\naccuracy\nschemes\nall\nappear\nto require\nmore CPU tlme\nto converge.\nFor this\nreason,\nthe next\nsection\ndiscusses\nsolution\nalgorithms.\nSIMPLE (semi-Implicit\npressure-linked\nequations)\nis one of the most widely\nused solution\nalgorithms\nfor solving\nthe\nsteady-state\nform of the Navler-Stokes\nequations.\nAlthough\nthis\nscheme has\nproven\nto be quite effective,\nits\nconvergence\nrate\ncan be improved.\nThis\npaper\nfocuses\non two approaches\nwhich\naccelerate\nconvergence\nby performing\ncorrections\nthat\nimprove\nthe lteratlve\nagreement\nwith\ncontinuity.\nThese\nalternate\nschemes are illustrated\nIn a series\nof calculations.\nA third section\nillustrative example\n\nexamines the importance\nIs displayed.\n\nof inlet\n\nboundary\n\nconditions.\n\nAn\n\nThe fourth section discusses turbulence models and reaction closures.\nHere the more pragmatic approaches to calculating\nturbulent reactions are\nillustrated.\nAn eddy-breakup model and a PDF (probability density function)\nmethod are described and compared.\nFinally, the fifth section examines the accuracy of a radiation heattransfer model.\nA six-flux model of radiative heat transfer Is described.\nThis model provides only a limited geometric description of the radiation\ntransfer process, but a comparison wlth experimental data indicates an encouraging level of agreement.\nNUMERICAL\n\nACCURACY\n\nThe following Is a general form of the tlme-averaged\nbe solved In a combustor flow code:\n\na_(pu_)\n\na\n\na\n\na\n\nequations\n\nthat must\n\n(1)\n\na__\n\nwhere\n_\ncan represent\nU, V, W, UlUJ\'dK\'an c, or H;

As wlth QUICK, SUD can\nproduce nonphysical oscillations\nin the solution; therefore, a scheme to\n"bound" SUD was also examined.\nThis scheme employs the concept of fluxblending (ref. 3), wherein a bounded flux determined from upwind differencing\nIs blended wlth the unbounded, but more accurate, SUD flux.\nThe maln factor\nIs to blend as little of the lesser accurate scheme while still maintaining\na\nproperly "bounded" solution.\nThls procedure, called BSUDS, starts from an\ninitial, totally skew-dlfferenced\nestimate and blends an upwind flux If the\nsolution Is out of the range of neighboring values.\nIf the solution is In\nrange (i.e., bounded), then no blending Is performed.\nAn illustration of the accuracy of the upwind, QUICK, and SUD schemes Is\nseen In figure 4. This figure displays the results of a slngle-polnt scalartransport calculation made for various flow angles.\nAll schemes agree with an\nexact solution (no error) at a zero flow angle; however, at angles greater\nthan zero, each scheme displays some degree of error relating to numerical\ndiffusion.\nThe error displayed by upwind differencing\nincreases wlth flow\nangle to a maximum at 45 \xc2\xb0. The QUICK scheme displays a similar behavior, but\nthe overall error Is much less.\nThe SUD scheme displays a maximum error\naround 15 \xc2\xb0, but It tends to zero at angles approaching\n45 \xc2\xb0\nBoth QUICK and\nSUD display a much higher level of accuracy than upwind.\nAlthough a scalar transport calculation Is useful for a general examination of some aspects of differencing\nscheme performance, a laminar flow calculation Is a more complete test.\nThe results of a series of laminar flow\ncalculations\nfrom reference 4 are displayed In figure 5. In thls figure,\naxial velocity profiies at a distance of one-half a duct height from the _nlet\nare shown for two different computational\nmeshes.\nIn these calculations,\nthe\nsteepness of the velocity profile indicates accuracy.\nSteep velocity profiles\nare exhibited by QUICK and BSUDS; the upwind profiles exhibit a hlgh degree of\nnumerical diffusion.\nOn the coarse mesh, BSUDS appears to be more accurate\nthan QUICK; on the flne mesh, there Is not much of a distinction\nbetween the\ntwo schemes.\n\n34\n\nAn important\naspect\nof improved\naccuracy\nIs the effect\nthat\nthe differenclng\nscheme has on the rate of convergence.\nThe computational\ntimes\nto\nconverge\nthe system of governing\nequations\nIn the previous\nlaminar\ncalculations\nare shown tn table\nI.\nThe convergence\ntimes\nare ratioed\nto the upwind\nconvergence\ntimes\nto clearly\nillustrate\nthe computational\npenalty\npaid to\nattain\nimproved\naccuracy.\nGenerally,\nthe improved\naccuracy\nschemes required\nfrom 3 to 15 times\nlonger\nto reach a converged\nsolution.\nTo a degree one can\nhope that\nthis\ncomputational\npenalty\ncan be offset\nby using coarse meshes to\nachieve\nthe same overall\nlevel\nof accuracy.\nIn reality,\na relatively\nfine\nmesh Is needed,\neven with\nthe high-accuracy\nschemes.\nIn any case, the need\nfor improved\nsolution\nalgorithms\nfor these more accurate\ndifferencing\nschemes\nIs strongly\nindicated.\nSOLUTION\n\nALGORITHMS\n\nThe previous section demonstrated the need for improved solution algorithms.\nThls section examines the widely used SIMPLE algorithm and two modifications to this scheme.\nThese schemes cover only a small portion of the\nwlde range of methods to accelerate solution convergence.\nVectorlzatlon,\ndlrect-solutlon\nmethods, and multlgrld methods - to llst Just a few - are all\nareas of active research that are certain to yield much greater computational\nbenefits In the near future.\nIn the SIMPLE algorithm, a guessed pressure field is inserted Into the\ndlscretlzed\nmomentum equations to obtain a velocity field.\nThe pressure field\nis corrected by an equation which Is derived through a combination of the continuity and momentum equations.\nThe velocity field Is then updated and is\nused In the solution of the equations for\nk, c, and\n_. The corrected pressure field Is treated as the guessed pressure field, and the procedure Is\nrepeated until a converged solution Is obtained.\n\nfor\n\nThe following velocity\nu at point\ne:\n\ncorrection\n\nequation\n\nis used\n\nIn the SIMPLE\n\nscheme\n\nAeU\'e = n_b AnbUnb + (P_ - P_)A e\nPrimes indicate corrections to old values.\nThe underlined term, which represents the influence of corrected pressures on neighboring velocities,\nis\nneglected In the SIMPLE algorithm.\nThe converged solution Is unchanged by the\nexclusion of thls term slnce, for the steady-state solution, the corrections\ngo to zero.\nNeglecting terms, however, does force the use of low underrelaxatlon factors, which can slow convergence.\nThe SIMPLER\n\nalgorithm\n\nimproves\n\non the SIMPLE\n\nscheme\n\nby including\n\nthe\n\npreviously neglected terms when calculating the pressure field.\nThe calculation sequence starts wlth a guessed velocity field.\nAn equation that solves\nfor the pressure field (using the terms ignored In the SIMPLE scheme) Is calculated from the guessed velocity field.\nThls pressure field is then used to\nsolve the dlscretlzed momentum equations to obtain a velocity field.\nThe\nvelocity field Is corrected In a manner similar to the SIMPLE velocity correction.\nThls velocity field Is then treated as the guessed velocity field, and\nthe iteration procedure is repeated until convergence Is reached.\n\n35\n\nBecause additional equations are solved, each iteration through the\nSIMPLER routine involves more computational\ntime than an iteration step through\nSIMPLE.\nHowever, higher underrelaxatlon\nfactors can be applied in the SIMPLER\nroutine, thereby accelerating convergence.\nThe PISO scheme also takes into account the terms neglected in the SIMPLE\ncode, but in a different manner.\nThe PISO routine mimics the SIMPLE approach\nuntil the end of the first iteration.\nAt this point, the PISO scheme employs\nan equation containing the neglected terms to correct the pressure and velocIty field to more closely agree with continuity.\nAgain, this procedure is\nrepeated until the solution converges.\nIn this manner, the PISO code allows\nfor higher underrelaxation\nfactors to accelerate convergence.\nThe performance of these various solution schemes is displayed in\nfigure 6. As an example, the convergence times for a 38-by-38 grid point\ncalculation are plotted as a function of underrelaxation\nfactor (fig. 6(a)).\nWhen a reasonably large underrelaxatlon\nfactor is used, SIMPLER or PISO converge about twice as fast as SIMPLE.\nIn addition, SIMPLER and PISO converge\nover a larger range of underrelaxatlon\nfactors than SIMPLE.\nFrom an engineering standpoint, improving the "robustness" of a computational\nscheme is often\nJust as important as accelerating convergence.\nThe computational\nbenefit of\nusing SIMPLER and PISO for flne-mesh calculations\nis displayed in figure 6(b).\nThe greater the number of mesh points used in the calculation,\nthe greater the\nbenefit of SIMPLER or PISO over SIMPLE.\nFor example, a calculation\nof approximately 3300 grid points converges three times faster using PISO or SIMPLER\nthan it does using SIMPLE.\nThis is a savings of about 600 CPU seconds.\nThe\n1440 grid points calculation demonstrated a savings of only about lO0 CPU\nseconds.\nINLET\n\nBOUNDARY\n\nCONDITIONS\n\nIn any calculation of a complex, three-dlmenslonal\nturbulent flow, the\nboundary conditions that are needed in the calculation are frequently unknown\nor unmeasured.\nThe use of inappropriate\nvalues at the computational\nboundary\ncan sometimes be the main limit to the calculatlon\'s\npredictive capability.\nThis error can sometimes be more important than numerical accuracy or turbulence model considerations.\nFigure 7 shows an example of a three-dlmenslonal\nJet-ln-crossflow\ncalculation using alternate boundary conditions.\nIn one\ncalculation, the Jet orifice flow was specified as having a uniform plug flow\nat a position two Jet diameters upstream of the orifice outlet.\nThis allowed\nthe flow to distort as it exited the orifice outlet.\nThe second calculation\nspecified a uniform plug flow at the orifice outlet.\nThe resulting axial\nvelocity profiles are compared with experimental data in figure B. Somewhat\nsurprisingly,\nthe uniform boundary condition at the orifice compared more\nfavorably with experimental data than the theoretically more correct distorted\nprofile.\nThis should not be interpreted as an endorsement of the use of\nunlform-plug-flow\nboundary conditions for these types of flows.\nIndeed, there\nis some indication of experimental error (ref. 5).\nThis example is meant only\nto illustrate that unmeasured or unknown boundary conditions can significantly\naffect a numerical calculation.\nTURBULENCE\n\nMODELS\n\nAlthough a great deal of progress is being made in solving the threedimensional,\ntlme-dependent Navler-Stokes\nequations in large-eddy or direct\n36\n\nnumerical\nsimulations,\npractical\nthe introduction\nof some form of\n\nengineering\nturbulence\n\ncalculations\nmodeling.\n\ncurrently\nThese models\n\nrequire\nare based\n\non either\nReynolds or Favre averaging\nof the exact Navter-Stokes\nequations,\nreducing\nthe unsteady form of these\nequations\nto an averaged\nform.\nCurrently,\nthe most widely\nused turbulence\nmodel Is the two equation,\nk-c,\nclosure.\nThis\nmodel relates\nthe Reynolds stresses\nto a turbulent\nviscosity\nthrough\nBousslnesq\'s\neddy-viscosity\nconcept:\n\npuiu\n\n: P"T aTj+ axt/\n\nwhere\nv T = Cuk2/c.\nThe turbulent\nviscosity\nIs related\nenergy\nk\nand the dissipation\nrate\nc of the turbulence.\nequations\nare then solved for\nk\nand c:\n\nUi\n\na xl\n\n-\n\naxl\\_k--\n\n_\'_ IJ\n\n+ VTta-_\n\n(8)\n\n7 61Jk\nto\n\n\xc3\xb7 axlj_-\n\nthe kinetic\nThe transport\n\ni:\n\n(9)\nUI\nWhere\n\nC\n\naxt\n\n-\n\naXl _- l-)c_\'_\n\n.i- Col _. lITta-._-_ + _-\'_\'1) ax,\'l\n\n= o.og, Col = 1.44, Cc2 = 1.92, _k = 1.O,\n\n(I12)(_ \'2 + _,2 + _,2)\n\nand\n\no\n\n= 1.3, o\n\n= 0.9,\n\nk =\n\nc = C k3/211T .\n\nThe model constants typically employed are those recommended in\nreference 6.

Chin, W.M. LI, and X.F. Wang\nInstitute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\nBelJlng, People\'s Republic of China\n\nThe variation of spray characteristics\nalong a radial distance downstream\nof a pressure-swlrl\natomizer was measured by laser llght-scatterlng\ntechnology.\nAn analytical model was developed to predict the variation of spray characteristics along the radial distance.\nA comparison of the predicted and experimental data showed excellent agreement.\nTherefore, the spray model proposed,\nalthough relatively simple, is correct and can be used, with some expansion\nand modification\nof the prepared model, to predict more complicated spray\nsystems.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nThe characteristics\nof the spray formed by an atomizer in a llquld-fueled\ncombustion device are extremely important to the performance,\nstability, and\npollutant formation of the combustor.\nThe spray characteristics\nshould be\nmeasured accurately, and a model should be developed to predict the variation\nof spray characteristics,\ndroplet trajectory, spray dispersion, and evaporation history.\nIt is also important to understand the influence of various\nfactors on the measurement of spray characteristics.\nA comparison between\npredicted and measured spray characteristics\nprovides useful insight into\nspray combustion.\nSuch research has a slgnlflcant effect on engineering\napplications and on the fundamental understanding\nof spray combustion.\nThe authors analyzed the variation of spray characteristics\nalong the\naxial distance downstream of a pressure-swirl\natomizer.\nThe effect of spray\nevaporation on the variation of spray characteristics\nis discussed in\nreference 1 and was presented by J.S. Chin and J.Y. Zhu at this symposium.\n(Paper, entitled The Interdependence\nof Spray Characteristics\nand Evaporation\nHistory of Fuel Sprays in High Temperature Airflows, was unavailable for\nprinting at the time of publication.)\nThe influence of downstream distance on\nthe spray characteristics\nof pressure-swirl\natomizers is caused by the effects\nof spray dispersion and drop acceleration or deceleration.\nThis condltlon is\nanalyzed in reference 2. These analyses have been partially substantiated\nby\nsome experimental data.\nUntil now there have been few experimental data of\nthe variation of spray characteristics\nalong the radial distance downstream of\nthe pressure-swlrl\natomizer.\nLee Dodge published his measurement\nresults as\nshown in figure 1 (ref. 3).\nHe shows that both the Sauter mean diameter SMD\nand drop-slze distribution parameter\nN\nincrease with radial distance.\nThere\nis no analysis on this aspect available at the present time.\nWe are interested in comparing the experimental and predicted values of\nthe variation of spray characterlstlcs\nalong the radial distance.\nTherefore,\nwe carefully measured this variation in a well-deflned\nexperimental condition,\n"developed an analytical model to predict the variation, and then compared the\n47\n\nexperimental and predicted\n\ndata.\nThese comparisons promote our understanding\nof spray dispersion and the factors influencing drop-slze measurement.\nAfter\nwe have predicted the simple spray system, we will be able to expand and\nmodify the proposed spray model to extend its capability to more complicated\nspray systems.\nCao and Chin proposed\n\na flat-fan\n\nspray model\n\nfor the fuel distribution\n\ndownstream of a plain orifice injector under cross airflow (ref. 4).\nThe\nmodel was validated by fuel distribution measured by gas analysis and drop\nsize.\nIt is obvious that, for the validation of a given spray model, the\nspray characteristics measurement\nis reliably accurate and much simpler than\nthe fuel distribution measurement.\nIt is this author\'s intention to validate\na spray model by measuring the spray characteristics\nalong the radial distance.\nThe same spray model has also been validated by measuring the spray characteristics along different\nB\nangles (as shown in fig. 5).\n\nTEST APPARATUS,\n\nATOMIZER,\n\nAND PARTICLE\n\nSIZER\n\nThe test section was a rectangular chamber with transparent windows for\noptical drop-slze measurement.\nThe test apparatus included an air system and\na fuel system, as shown in figure 2.\nThe atomizer tested (fig. 3) was a pressure-swlrl\natomizer taken from an\nexisting aircraft gas-turblne engine.\nThe atomizer had a pilot-fuel flow and\na main-fuel flow.\nIn this test we used the pilot-fuel passage.\nBecause the\nflow rate is relatively lower with pilot-fuel flow, the obscuratlon was In the\nright range.\nA Malvern drop-slze analyzer model 2200 was used.\nThe principle of the\nparticle slzer is shown in figure 4. The instrument was set on the RosinRammler distribution mode.\nThe direct results from the instrument are the\ncharacteristic diameter\nB and the drop-slze distribution parameter\nN\nin\nthe\nR-R\ndistribution which is expressed by\n\nexo[,N]\nwhere\nQ is the fractlon\ndiameter less than D.\n\nof the total\n\nThe Sauter mean diameter\n\nvolume\n\ncontained\n\nSMD can be obtained\n\nin drops\n\n(I)\n\nthat have a\n\nfrom\n\n(2)\nwhere\n\nr\n\nis the gamma function.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL\n\nRESULTS\n\nDuring drop-size measurement tests, the laser light beam was first\nadjusted so that it was in the same horizontal plane as the central line of\nthe atomizer and that it was perpendicular\nto this central llne.\nAt this\n48\n\nposition\n(defined\nas the\ny = 0 position),\nthe spray characteristics\nwere\nmeasured.\nThen the Malvern\nparticle\nslzer\nwas put on some stze blocks of\nknown dimension.\nThis changed the height of the laser\nbeam so that\nthe radtal\ndistance\nwhere the parttcle\nstzer\nmeasured the drop stze was changed.\nThe\nsummation of the size block was defined\nas the radlal\ndistance\ny.\nThe dlmenslons of the blocks chosen were 2.5,\n3.0,\nand l0 mm.\nThus, the following\nradial\ndistance\ny\ncould be obtained\nby different\ncombinations\nof the size\nblocks:\ny = 0, 5.5,\n10.0,\n15.5,\n20.0,\n25.5,\nand 30.0 mm. The experimental\nresults\nare shown In figures\n6 to 13.\nFrom these\nfigures\nit\nIs clear\nthat\nthe\nSauter mean diameter\nand drop-size\ndistribution\nparameter\nincrease\nwith\nradial\ndistance\nuntil\nthe edge of the spray has been reached.\nThe experlmental\nresults\nobtained\nby the present\nauthors\nare quantitatively\ntn good agreement\nwith\nLee Dodge\'s\nresults.\nThe obvious explanation\nof the measured results\nshown in figures\n6 to 13 is that\nwtth\nlarger\nradial\ndistances\nthe possibility\nof the laser\nlight\nbeam meeting\nthe large drops ts greater\nthan tt is with\nsmaller\nradtal\ndistances.\nThts shows that\nwhen we measure the drop size it ts\nnecessary\nto take a sample that\nIs representative\nof the spray formed;\nhowever,\nit\nls impossible\nto define\nthe sample which would fully\nrepresent\nthe\nspray.\nThe most reasonable\nsample can be obtained\nby measuring\nthe spray at\nthe\ny = 0 position.\nComparing figure 6 wlth 8 and 7 wlth 9 shows that, at a higher airflow\nvelocity, the change of spray characteristics\nalong the radial distance Is\nweaker.\nA comparison of figures 8, lO, and 12 and of 9, II, and 13 shows\nthat, wlth a lower pressure drop across the nozzle, the change of the spray\ncharacteristics\nalong the radial distance Is weaker.\nThese results tell us\nthat when the spray Is expanded less radially the change of spray characteristics is also flatter.\nThe reverse Is also true.\nThe experimental\nposed spray model.\n\ndata obtained\n\nIn thls way were\n\nused to check\n\nthe pro-\n\nPHYSICAL MODEL\nThe spray formed by a pressure-swlrl atomizer Is shown\nphysical model was proposed wlth the following assumptions:\n\nIn figure\n\n5.\n\nThe\n\n(I) The atomization process is completed as soon as the fuel leaves the\natomizer nozzle; that Is, droplets of different sizes start their movement at\nthe nozzle exit.\nDroplets of different sizes have the same initial velocity.\nBecause It Is suitable to use a cylindrical coordinate system to describe\ndroplet motion, the tangential velocity and the radial velocity component can\nbe combined and treated as one velocity component.\n(2) The airflow\n(3)\nneglected.\n\nThe air\n\nIs\n\nIs uniform.\nat\n\nambient\n\ntemperature,\n\n(4) The influence of different droplet\nurements made by the Malvern particle slzer\n\nwlth\n\nThe initial\nthe initial\n\nso droplet\n\nevaporation\n\nvelocities on the drop-slze\nIs neglected.\n\ndrop-slze distribution can be expressed\nvolume fraction (dQ/dD) o as\n49\n\ncan be\n\nby\n\nDo(SMDo)\n\nmeas-\n\nand\n\nNo\n\nN -l\n\nNo l\xc2\xb0\n\ndD o\n\n(3)\n\nDO\n\nAt a downstream distance\nx, the droplets of diameter\nD move from the origin\nand then distribute themselves on a circumference\nof radius\nR(D) while the\nlaser light beam of diameter\ndj only meets some of these droplets:\n\n(4)\n\nwhere\n\nm I = arcsln\n\nof\n\nm2\n\nand\n\n(5)\n\nm2 = arcsln\nThe definitions\n\n1\nYo -

These are compared\nwith the corresponding experimental data.\nIt is obvious that the predictions\nare in excellent agreement with the experimental\nresults.\n\nCONCLUDING\n\nREMARKS\n\nIn the present study, droplet evaporation was neglected (discussed by\nJ.S. Chin and J.Y. Zhu in the unpublished paper cited previously), and it is\nnot difficult to take into consideration\nthe effect of droplet evaporation.\nAfter this model\nthe fuel distribution\n\nhas been validated, it is relatively simple to predict\ndownstream of a pressure-swirl\natomizer (ref. 6).\n\nOne interesting point that was noticed from the experiments and the analysis was that the larger droplets are always at the spray edge.\nBecause the\nignition spark plug is also always positioned close to the spray edge, the\nspark might meet the larger droplets, which would harm the ignition.\nWe measured the variation of spray characteristics\nalong the radial distance was by laser light-scatterlng\ntechnology.\nAnd we found that the prediction based on the proposed spray model was in excellent agreement with the\nexperimental data.\n\nREFERENCES\nl\n\n\xc2\xb0\n\n.\n\nJ.S.

Taclna\nLewis Research Center\nCleveland, Ohio\n\nAn experimental program to characterize the spray from candidate nozzles\nfor Iclng-cloud\nsimulation is discussed.\nOne candidate nozzle, which is currently used for icing research, has been characterized\nfor flow and drop size.\nThe medlan-volume\ndiameter (MVD) from this alr-asslst nozzle is compared with\ncorrelations\nin the literature.\nThe new experimental\nspray facility is discussed, and the drop-slze instruments are discussed in detail.\nSince there is\nno absolute standard for drop-slze measurements and there are other limitations, such as drop-slze range and velocity range, several instruments are used\nand the results are compared.\nThe drop-slze instruments used are the Malvern\n2600, the NASA Lewis Scanning Radiometer, the Phase/Doppler\nSpray Analyzer\n(P/DSA), a Forward-Scatterlng\nSpectrometer Probe (FSSP), an Optical Array Probe\n(OAP), and a limited amount of photography.\nThe known capabilities and llmltations of the drop-slze instruments are compared.\nA two-phase model was developed at Pennsylvania State University.\nThe\nmodel uses the\nk-c model of turbulence in the contlnous phase.\nThree methods\nfor treating the discrete phase are used:\n(1) a locally homogenous flow (LHF)\nmodel, (2) a deterministic\nseparated flow (DSF) model, and (3) a stochastic\nseparated flow (SSF) model.\nIn the LHF model both phases have the same velocity and temperature at each point.\nThe DSF model provides Interphase transport\nbut ignores the effects of turbulent fluctuations.\nIn the SSF model the drops\ninteract with turbulent eddies whose properties are determined by the\nk-c\nturbulence model.\nThe two-phase flow model has been extended to include the\neffects of evaporation and combustion.\nModel development has been accompanied\nby an experimental program to provide data for verification.\nPresently, the\nmodel has been further extended at NASA Lewis to include the effects of\nswirling flow, and a partlcle-laden\nswirling flow experiment\nbeing performed to provide verification data.\n\nis currently\n\nINTRODUCTION\nSprays and two-phase flow are of interest in many fields - for example,\ngas turbine combustion, agricultural crop spraying, paint spraying, fire protection, and drying.\nThis paper describes the use of sprays to simulate icing\nclouds for the Altitude Wind Tunnel Icing Research Program.\nIclng-cloud simulation and gas turbine combustion research have common interests in the method\nof injection, the characterization\nof drop size and of droplet velocities, and\nthe development of analytical models for droplet trajectories\nand droplet\nvaporization.\nThis paper discusses injector or spray-nozzle drop-slze characterization, an experimental test facility for injector characterization,\ndropsize measurement\ntechniques, and analytical models for trajectory calculations.\n\nIN3ECTOR\n\nCHARACTERIZATION\n\nThe injector, or spray nozzle, used currently\nat the NASA Lewis Research Center is an alr-asslst\n63\n\nfor Iclng-cloud\nsimulation\ninjector (fig. l).\nIt is\n\nvery similar\n\nto the injector used by Nuklyama and Tanasawa (ref. 1).\nThe water\nflows through a center tube (0.635-mm dlam) and has a concentric annular passage (9.35-mm dlam) for alr-asslst flow.\nThe water and the air exit through a\n3.175-mm orifice.\nThe advantage of an alr-asslst\ninjector for icing research\nand other applications is that, within limits, there Is nearly independent\ncontrol of water flowrate and drop size.\nThe water flow Is controlled by the\ndifference between the air pressure and water pressure, and the drop slze Is\ncontrolled by the alr pressure only.\nDrop-slze measurements using this injector were made for us at Arnold\nEngineering Development Center by J.L. Hunt.\nThe drop-slze data shown In\nfigure 2 are plotted as medlan-volume\ndiameter in micrometers.\nThe medianvolume diameter\nMVD\nis defined as the drop size where 50 percent of the total\ndroplet volume is contained in droplets less than that diameter, and 50 percent\nis contained In droplets greater than that diameter.\nThe MVD is plotted as a\nfunction of the difference of water and alr-asslst pressure wlth the airassist pressure as a parameter.\nThis method of correlating the data is very useful for setting the operating conditions in the wind tunnel.\nHowever, the drop-slze data could be\npresented in a more fundamental manner as a function of the water to air mass\nratio.\nOther factors that appear in correlations\nIn the literature,\nsuch as\nviscosity, surface tension, and relative velocity between the air and water,\nare constant or nearly constant for these data.\nThe relative velocity Is\nnearly constant, even though the flowrates are changing.\nThe reason for this\nIs, first, that the alr Is being injected at high pressure into a low-pressure\nambient environment and thus has sonic, or nearly sonic, velocity.\nSecond, the\nwater pressure is relatively low so that the water has a relatively small\nvelocity compared to the sonic velocity of the air.\nThus, the difference In\nthe velocities or the relative velocity is constant.\nThese data were compared to values from various correlations.\nThese comparisons are shown in figure 3 for one alr-asslst pressure.\nThe injectors used\nin the references were similar to the NASA Lewis Research Center injector.\nHowever, the drop-slze measurement\ntechniques were different.\nThe NuklyamaTanasawa (ref. l) drop-slze correlation was made from measurements\nof water\ndroplets on photographs.\nThe Lorenzetto-Lefebvre\ncorrelation\n(ref. 2) was made\nfrom llght-scatterlng\nmeasurements\nof water droplets.\nWlgg (ref. 3) used\nmeasurements\nfrom molten wax sprays with swirl.\nAs you can see in the figure,\nthe results of the correlations\nhave a wide range of values, some higher and\nsome lower than the data taken at Arnold.\nPreliminary data taken at NASA\nLewis seem to be closest to the data of Nuklyama-Tanasawa.\nPreliminary\ndata taken With the NASA Lewis injector at Carnegle-Mellon\nUniversity are lower\nthan the Arnold data.\nThere needs to be much more work on drop-slze measurements and correlations before drop sizes can be accurately predicted.\n\nTEST\n\nFACILITY\n\nThe objectives of our experimental program are to characterize a variety\nof candidate injectors for drop size and dispersion, to compare different\ndrop-size measurement techniques, and to take data that can be used for trajectory models.\nTrajectory model data consist of initial condition data taken\nupstream close to the injector and verification data taken far downstream.\n\n64\n\nThe test\nstand is shown In\ndiameter\npipe.\nThe maximum atr\nbe able to control\nthe relative\nfar upstream.\nControlling\noration\nts important.\n\nthe\n\nfigure\n4.\nDuct air enters\nthrough\na 40-cmvelocity\nthrough\nthe pipe is 88 m/sec.\nWe wtll\nhumldtty\nfrom 0 to 100 percent\nby adding steam\nrelative\n\nhumidity\n\ncould\n\nbe necessary\n\ntf\n\nevap-\n\nThe duct atr temperature\nwtll\nbe controlled\nby injecting\nltquid\nnitrogen\nupstream.\nThe primary\nuse of the temperature\ncontrol\nwill\nbe to provide\na\nconstant\nInlet\ntemperature\nof 292 K.

(The inserts in figure 5 describe the principle\nof operation.)\nThis instrument measures the angle that the light is diffracted\nby the drops.\nThe bigger drops diffract the light at a small angle and the\nsmaller drops diffract the light at a larger angle.\nThe detector is a series\nof concentric rings that determine the angle of the scattered light.\nThe drop\nsize is calculated from the scattered light angle.\nThe insert also shows that,\nno matter where the droplet is in the llne of sight, the light that is scattered at the same angle always falls on the same detector ring.\nAlthough there is no standard for determining drop sizes, we use a\nHirleman reticle for calibration purposes.\nThe Hirleman reticle (fig. 6) consists of a glass substrate on which chrome disks are photographically\ndeposited.\nThe chrome disks are sized to represent a Rosln-Rammler distribution\nwith an x-bar of 50 and an n value of 3. One problem we have found using\nthe reticle with the Malvern 2600 is that there is a correction for anomalous\ndiffraction.\nThe Malvern calculations are based primarily on Fraunfaufer diffraction theory.\nHowever, for small drop sizes (below a diameter of 5 pm)\nthree-dimensional\neffects are considered; these effects are lumped under the\nterm anomalous diffraction.\nThus, the problem is that the reticle has twodimensional\ndisks and not three-dimenslonal\nspheres.\nWe are currently studying\nthe feaslblllty of modifying the Malvern software to ignore the anomalous diffraction calculation when using the reticle.\nIf this does not prove to be\npractical, we will still use the reticle for relative comparisons.\nWe also plan to add an additional lens system to the Malvern to be able\nto measure an MVD of 5 pm across the 30-cm instrument section.\nVerification\nof the correctness of the additional lens system will be done by taking measurements of the retlcle with and without the additional lens system.\nThe second instrument, the Scattered-Light\nScanner, is also based on the\ndiffraction\nprinciple.\nThis is a revised version of the NASA Lewis Scanning\nRadiometer (described in ref. 5), which was developed by Don Buchele and used\nin many research projects by Robert Ingebo.\nFigures 7 to 9 explain the operation of the instrument.\nFigure 7 shows the reflection, refraction, and dlffractlon\nof a laser\nlight beam passing through a drop.\nSince calculations are based on the diffraction of light through the drop, the wlde-angle diffraction\nis ignored.\nThere is narrow-angle diffracted light from the envelope (or aperture) of the\nlaser beam that must also be ignored.\nF!gur_ R(a) It a plot of light intensity as a function of the llght-scatter

intensity of the near envelope\ndiffraction\nis negligible to a value of the light intensity which is still high\nenough to be meaningful.\nA scanner is used to measure the intensity of the\nscattered light as a function of the light scatter angle.\nThe scanner is a\n\n66\n\ndisk wtth\na radial\nslot\nlaser\nbeam

4\xc2\xb0 to 14 \xc2\xb0. The curve Is shown for a Gausslan T-type (transverse\nelectric) beam. This Is a multlvalued\nfunction; thus, for a given intensity,\nthe drop slze may not be uniquely determined.\nThe actual instrument uses a\nhlgh-mode laser beam which has a smooth curve and Is single valued.\nThe last drop-slze instrument to be discussed Is the Optical Array Probe\n(OAP), which can also be flown on an airplane to measure raindrop sizes.\nThls\ninstrument Is made by the same company as the FSSP, but It Is made to cover a\nlarger drop-slze range.\nThe operating principle Is shown In figure 15.\nIt Is\na slngle-partlcle\nimaging system.\nThe drops pass through a laser beam, and\nthen the light is transmitted through the instrument optics to an array of\nphotodetectors.\nThe drop slze Is determined by counting the detectors In the\nshadow of the drop.\nThe last detector at each end is kept open as a check to\ndetermine If the whole drop Is seen.\nTo determine If the drop Is In focus, we\nuse an intensity gradient criteria.\nAn Infocus drop has a sharp gradient from\nllt to unlit photodetectors,\nwhile an out-of-focus drop has a gradual gradient\nfrom llt to unlit.\nFigure 16 Is a simple schematic of the OAP.\nTable I compares the FSSP, OAP, Malvern 2600, Scattered-Llght\nScanner, and\nPhase/Doppler\nParticle Analyzer (P/DSA) drop-slze instruments.\nThe slze range\nrefers to the droplet diameters that can be measured wlth any particular setup.\nThe number of bins refers to the number of increments Into which the size range\nis divided.\nThe overall slze range then refers to the smallest to the largest\ndiameter that can be measured, but It may

modeling\nwork.\n\n68\n\nANALYTICAL TRAJECTORY MODELS\nThe second part of thts\nreport\ndescribes\nspray model development.\nThe\nmodel work to be presented\nwas done at Pennsylvania\nState\nUniversity\nby Professor\nFaeth and his graduate\nstudents\nand associates\n(refs.\n8 to 10).\nFtgure\n17 shows the Important\nInteractions\nof the drop with\nIts environment.\nThese Interactions\nare:\nthe drop]et\ndrag that\nresults\ntn a source term tn the\ncontinuous\nflow equation,\nrandom deflections\nof the drops by turbulent\neddtes,\nand turbulence\nmodulation\nof the continuous\nphase by the extraction\nof turbulent\nenergy by the droplet\ndrag.\nActually,\nthree\nmodels\nof Increasing\ncomplextty\nwere developed.\nThey are a locally\nhomogenous flow model,\na determlntstlc\nseparated-flow\nmodel,\nand a stochastic\nseparated-flow\nmodel.\nThe locally\nhomogenous flow model ts the simplest\nmodel (ftg.\n18).\nIt\nuses the\nk-c\nmodel to calculate\nthe continuous-phase\nflow characteristics.\nIt then assumes that\nthe particles\nhave the same velocity\nas the continuous\nphase and treats\nthe\nk-c\nequations\nas a varying-density\nflow.\nThis model Is\ncorrect\nfor small drops that\nfollow\nthe continuous\nphase flow.\nAn advantage\nof the model ts that\nthe calculation\nIs no more complex for a two-phase\nflow\nthan for a single-phase\nflow.\nIt Is also useful\nwhen the lntttal\nconditions\nof the spray,\nsuch as drop size or spray angle,\nare not available\nsince they\nare not needed tn the calculation.\nThe second model Is the deterministic\nseparated\nflow (DSF) model\n(fig.\n19).\nIt also uses the\nk-c\nmodel to calculate\nthe gas or continuousphase flowfleld.\nThe parttcle\nor droplet\ndistribution\nIs dtvtded\ntnto\na number\nof classes\nwtth\na representative\nnumber of droplets\ntn each class.\nThen, for\neach drop,\nthe trajectory\nts calculated.\nThe trajectory\ncalculation\nts based\non the mean continuous-phase\nflow properties.\nDispersion\ndue to turbulence\nIs\nIgnored.\nThts Is the most wtdely\nused approximation\nIn current\nmodels of combusting\nsprays.\nOther assumptions\nare that\nthe drops are spherical\nand that\nthe spray Is dilute\nwtth\nno collisions.\nOne feature\nof this\nmodel ts the partlcle-ln-cell\napproach.\nAs a particle\ngoes through\na cell,\nthe drag momentum ts coupled wtth\nthe continuous-phase\nmomentum.\nThe net change In momentum Is calculated\nfor each drop class\nas It\npasses through\na computational\ncell\nas shown tn figUre\n20.\nThen the gas or\ncontinuous-phase\nflow equatton\nIs calculated\nwith\nthe change tn momentum as a\nsource term.\nThe last,\nand most complex,\nmodel Is the stochastic\nseparated\nflow (SSF)\nmodel (fig.\n21).\nIn this\nmodel,\nthe conttnuous_phaSe\nturbulence\ndoes Interact\nwith\nthe drop or particle.\nAgain the gas-phase\ncalculation\nIs made using the\nk-c\nmodel.\nTo make the Lagraglan\ndrop-trajectory\ncalculation\nwe assume the\ndrop Interacts\nwith\nan eddy.\nThe properties\nof the eddy have a distribution\nbased on a probability\ndensity\nfunctton\nwith\na standard\ndeviation\ndependence\non k.\nFrom the distribution,\nthe properties\nof the eddy are found by using a\nMonte Carlo technique.\nThe Interaction\nts shown tn figure\n22.\nThe drop\nInteracts\nwtth the eddy etther\nfor the 11fetlme\nof the eddy or the time tt\ntakes\nthe particle\nto traverse\nthe eddy.\nThe stze of the eddy Is based on the\ndissipation\nlength.\nThe number of calculations\nare much greater\nfor thts\n\n69\n\nmethod than for the deterministic\nseparated flow (DSF) model.\nWhile for the\nDSF model approximately 600 drops are sufficient for an accurate calculation,\nfor the stochastic separated flow model about 6000 drops are needed for an\naccurate calculation.\nAn experimental study was also done to complement the analytical modeling\neffort.\nFrom a large amount of data, four plots were chosen as representlve.\nFigure 23 is a plot of the mean axial velocities of the drops as a function of\nthe drop diameter at different axial locations.\nAn alr-asslst injector wlth\nan exlt-orlfice diameter of l.lg4 mm was used.\nThe initial conditions were\ntaken at an\nx/d of 50, where\nx Is the axial distance and\nd\nis the Injector-orifice diameter.\nThls is a distance of about 55 mm.\nThis was sufficient\ndistance for the spray to be well formed for most conditions.\nHowever, there\nwere some conditions where ligaments were observed.\nThe drop-slze and velocity measurements were made using double-flash\nphotography.\nTwo other methods were used to measure drop size.\nOne was slide\nImpactlon in which a slide coated with magnesium oxide was used.\nThe second\nalternate method was to measure drop size with a Malvern.\nThe Malvern measurement was used mainly to monitor the spray to determine whether the spray\nvaried from day to day.\nThe data were compared wlth the calculations from the stochastic separated\nflow model and the deterministic\nseparated flow model.\nThe calculations agree\nwell, with the data from the stochastic separated flow model agreeing the best.\nFor all the data plots, the stochastic separated flow model agreed well with\nthe data, while the deterministic\nseparated flow model and the locally homogenous model agreed well for some conditions and not so well for other conditions.\nFigure 24 shows the radial variation of mean liquid flux\nG.\nFor this\ncase, the SMD at an\nx/d of 50 was 30.\nAgain the calculations wlth the\nstochastic separated flow model agree well with the data for all conditions,\nwhile the other two models do not agree well for all conditions.\nIt Is interesting to note that the locally homogenous model underpredlcts\nthe data.\nFor\nall the previous work In which the locally homogenous model was calibrated with\nsolld-particle-laden\nflow, the model overpredlcted\nthe development of the\nspray.\nFigure 25 shows the variation of the Sauter mean diameter with the dlstance along the axis.\nFigure 25(a) is for a nonevaporatlng\noll spray and\nfigure 25(b) is for an evaporating Freon ll spray.\nCase 1 had an initial SMD\nof 30 at an\nx/d of 50 and case 2 had an initial SMD of 87.\nFor the nonevaporating case, the mean diameter increases after an x/d\nof lO0 because of the\ngreater dispersion of the small drops.\nThe stochastic separated flow model\ndoes better at predicting the data because it considers the dispersion due to\nturbulence.\nThe variation of SMO along the axis for an evaporating\nspray Is shown In\nfigure 25(b).\nFor an evaporating spray, there are competing effects:\nevaporation reduces the mean diameter, and greater dispersion of the small drops\nincreases the mean diameter along the axis.\nThe stochastic separated flow\nmodel and deterministic separated flow model do a good Job of predicting the\ntrends even if they do not exactly duplicate the data.\n\n70\n\nThe model development\nIs continuing\nat the NASA Lewis Research Center\nas\npart\nof a Ph.D. thests\n(by Daniel\nBulzan).\nThe ablltty\nto calculate\nflow\nfields\nwtth\nswirl\nhas been added to the model,\nand an experimental\ncalibration\nand verification\nts

Thus, the effect of inlet Mach number\n\n89\nC\n\n-_-\n\n_E_G\n\nP_E\n\n_\n\nNOT\n\nFILMED\n\ncan be neglected when testing or analyzing\nfuser for a turbofan augmentor.\n(2) We also obtained\n\nan important\n\nthe performance\n\nnondimenslonal\n\nof an annular\n\ndlf-\n\nflow parameter,\n\n: 05)(vi iO\n=-V --2(Ve e\n2\nIf we use a diffuser with the same geometry and a similar inner velocity\nprofile and maintain\nSD = constant, then the change of statlc-pressure\nrecovery coefficients and nondlmenslonal,\ncombined veloclty-temperature\ncombination distributions\nalong the diffuser axial distance is the same, regardless\nof whether the test is done with low- or hlgh-temperature\nair, as shown in\nfigures 5 and 6. It is possible to use the low-temperature\ntest to simulate\nreal turbofan augmentor diffuser flow; low-temperature\nairflow separation can\nalso be used to understand hlgh-temperature\nairflow separation.\n\nRESEARCH\n\nON COMBUSIOR\n\nIGNIIION\n\nPERFORMANCE\n\nUnder the hlgh-altltude\nrellght condition, the combustion chamber inlet\npressure can be as low as 0.2 kg/cm2, and the inlet temperature can be as\nlow as -50 \xc2\xb0C. Because it is important for combustion engineers to understand\nthe relation between ignition performance and combustor inlet parameters, we\nstudied the effect of inlet parameters on the ignition performance of combustors with different fuel-injectlon\nsystems.\nThis test was performed on the hlgh-altltude\nignition test rig shown in\nfigure 7. Three combustor configurations\nwere used.\nThe first configuration\nwas a gas turbine combustor with a pressure swirl atomizer.\n(This combustor\nis similar to a JT-3D engine combustor with one flame tube.)\nThe second configuration was a one-quarter\nsector of a full annular combustor with three\nT-shaped vaporizers, as shown in figure 8. The third configuration\nwas similar\nto the second one - the only difference being that the three vaporizers had\nbeen replaced by three alrblast atomizers.\nA hlgh-energy ignition plug was used for every configuration.\nThe stored\nenergy of the ignition system was 20 J, 12 J, and 8 J, respectively.\nThe ignition procedures were repeated three times under every test condition.\nIf all\nthree ignitions were successful, then each was Judged a successful ignition at\nits specific condition.\nWe drew the following\n\nconclusions\n\nfrom\n\nthis experiment:\n\n(1) The inlet pressure has a significant effect on the ignition performance of the combustorso\nFigure 9 shows the optimum fuel-air ratio as a func\ntlon of inlet pressure for the three configurations.\nFrom figure 9 we can see\nthe effect of the inlet air pressure on ignition performance of the combustors,\nespecially at low pressure.\n(2) The inlet air temperature has a strong effect on the ignition performance of the combustors.\nThe effects of the inlet air temperature\non maximum\nignitable reference velocity and on optimum fuel-alr ratio for the three configurations are shown in figures lO and II. As the inlet air temperature\ndecreases, the maximum ignitable reference velocity decreases.\nAt higher inlet\n90\n\nair temperatures,\nthe effect\nof the Inlet\natr temperature\non the optimum\nable fuel-air\nratio\nIs very weak; however,\nat lower\ninlet\nalr\ntemperatures\neffect\nis very strong,\nespecially\nfor the vaporizer\ncombustor.\n\nsure\n\nFigures\n12(a),\nand temperature\n\n(b),\nand (c)\non ignition\n\nEXPERIMENIAL\n\nshow the combined\neffects\nperformance\nfor the three\n\nSTUDY ON AIRFLOW\n\nDISTRIBUTION\n\nof inlet\nair\nconflgurations.\n\nignitthe\n\npres-\n\nOF THE COMBUSIOR\n\nThe airflow distribution\ncharacteristics of a combustor directly affect\nthe performance of the combustor such as combustion efficiency,\nrange of stable operation, and temperature profile at the combustor exit.\nA 90 \xc2\xb0 segment\nof the annular combustor was used for this study.\nThe test assembly Is shown\nin figure 13.\nThe goals\n\nof the study were\n\nas follows:\n\n(1) To determine the effect of Mach number at the combustor inlet on the\nairflow distribution\nat an alr temperature of 291 K\n(2) To compare the changes of airflow distributions\nwlth and without\nburning in the combustor\nFigure 13 shows the eight instrumentation\nsections on the test assembly.\nThe flow rate\nGhl\nthrough the holes on the wall of the flame tube can be\ncalculated as follows:\n\nGhl = CdlAhl\n\n2_\n\nAP\n\nwhere\nCdl\nAhl\n\nairflow\narea\n\ndischarge\n\ncoefficient\n\nof the holes\n\nof the holes\n\nY\n\nspecific\n\ngravity\n\nAp\n\npressure\n\ndrop through\n\nacceleration\n\nof alr\nthe holes,\n\nof gravity\n\nThe flow rate (In percent)\ntotal is\n\nthrough\n\neach row of holes\n\nGi = lO0\n\nThe relative\n\narea\n\n= Pal - Pll\n\n(In percent)\n\nhi\n\nhl\n\n91\n\nis relative\n\nGhl\n\nof the holes of each\n\nAI = I00\n\nthat\n\nAh\n\nrow of holes\n\nis\n\nto the\n\nThe following\n\nconclusions\n\nwere\n\nobtained\n\nfrom this experimental\n\nstudy:\n\n(I) At the range tested, there is no apparent influence on the airflow\ndistribution by the Mach number at the combustor inlet, as shown in figures\n14(a) and (b).\n(2) Under the conditions\n1\n\nin\n\n= 291 K\n\nlex\n*/l* in = 1 N 2.44\nthe airflow distributions have no obvious change, regardless of whether burning\nis present or not, as shown in figures 15(a) and (b).\nHowever, we are not\ncertain that this would be true under real operating conditions.\n\nEXPERIMENIAL\n\nSIUDY\n\nON FUEL INJECTORS\n\nThe fuel injector is one of the most important components of a combustor\nor afterburner.\nIn order to determine the effects of geometric parameters,\nairflow parameters, and fuel rate on the fuel-spray characteristics,\nwe have\nmade an initial study of a vaporizer and an airblast atomizer.\nlhe test rig assembly is shown in figure 16.\nThe airflow\nthrough the fuel injector was measured by a turbine flowmeter.\nity at the injector exit was\n\nrate Ga\nThe air veloc-\n\nVa = Ga(R)T2/AP\nThe fuel rate\nGf was also obtained\nfuel ratio is given by\n\nby a turbine\n\nflowmeter\n\nwhere\n\nthe air-\n\nAFR = Ga/G f\nThe Sauter mean diameter (SMD) of the fuel spray drops\nMalvern laser particle slzer.\n\nEXPERIMENIAL\n\nSIUDY\n\nON VAPORIZER\n\nwas measured\n\nby a\n\nFUEL INJECIOR\n\nSince we tried to understand the spray characteristics\n- not the vaporizing condition - for different vaporizer fuel injectors, we studied the spray\ncharacteristics\nunder low inlet air temperature only and did not heat the\nvaporizer.\nSome of the test vaporizers are shown in figures 17 and 18.\nThe following\n\nconclusions\n\nwere made:\n\n(I) The air velocity\nVa at the vaporizer exit is the most important\nfactor affecting fuel atomization.\nAs shown in figure 19, SMD decreases with\nincreasing\nVa.\n\n92\n\n(2) The effect of air-fuel ratio on fuel atomization is related to the\nair velocity at the vaporizer exit.\nIf AFR<4 and the air velocity is low,\nthen, as AFR increases, SMD\nwill decrease.

Zeleznlk\nLewis Research Center\nCleveland, Ohio\n\nModeling fluid phase phenomena blends the conservation equations of continuum mechanics with the property equations of thermodynamics.\nThe thermodynamic contribution becomes especially important when the phenomena involve\nchemical reactions as they do in combustion systems.\nThe successful study of\ncombustion processes requires\n(1) the availability\nof accurate thermodynamic\nproperties for both the reactants and the products of reaction and (2) the\ncomputational\ncapabilities to use the properties.\nA discussion is given of\nsome aspects of the problem of estimating accurate thermodynamic\nproperties\nboth for reactants and products of reaction.\nAlso, some examples of the use\nof thermodynamic\nproperties for modeling chemically reacting systems are presented.\nThese examples include one-dlmenslonal\nflow systems and the internal\ncombustion engine.\n\nINTRODUCT ION\nModeling fluid phase phenomena always requires a combination of the conservation equations of continuum mechanics with the property functions of\nthermodynamics.\nFor some applications it is possible to idealize the model so\ndrastically\nthat the continuum equations virtually disappear and the computation becomes wholly thermodynamic.\nIn other situations the thermodynamic\nproperties are so highly idealized that the computation deals solely with the\ncontinuum equations.\nConsequently,\nthermodynamics and continuum mechanics are\noften viewed as independent disciplines.\nHowever, the complementary\nnature of\nthe two disciplines\nis manifested in attempts to generate realistic models of\nphysical systems in which combustion occurs.\nThe roles of thermodynamics\nand the conservation equations are easily discerned by examining the relevant equations.\nThe conservation equations\n(refs. l and 2) for mass, species, energy, and momentum are shown in\nequation (1), where the summation convention is used for an index repeated as\na subscript and a superscript:\na__m\n6m\nk\nat \xc3\xb7 Vk (mvk) = 0 = _-_ \xc3\xb7 mvkv\n\na(mnx)\nat\n\n\xc3\xb7 vk(mn_vk\n\n+ vk(muv k) = -

Hence, the\nthermodynamic properties of free radicals are of considerable interest.\nUnfortunately, relatively\nlittle\nis knownabout the thermodynamic properties\nof radicals over the extended temperature range encountered in combustion\nsystems. Hence, we have found it necessary to estimate the thermodynamic\nproperties of the phenyl, phenoxy, and blphenyl free radicals which are likely\nto be important species in the combustion of hydrocarbons and in soot formation.\nBecause of their low concentrations and because most combustion processes\ntake place at relatively\nlow pressures and high temperatures, it is usually\nadequate to estimate free radical properties in the ideal gas state.\nThermodynamicproperties for any species in an ideal gas state can be\nestimated from the canonical partition function using the formulas of statlstlcal thermodynamics. This requires knowledge of the species\' molecular\nstructure, its vibrational and rotational energy levels, any barriers to\ninternal rotation, and the standard state heat of formation.\nThe difficulty\nis that this information is seldom available for free radicals.\nAs a result\nit becomesnecessary to estimate these data from similar, stable species whose\nmolecular properties have been measured, l hese stable, related species are\ncalled the parent species of the radicals.\nThe species benzene, phenol and\nblphenyl are suitable parent species for the radicals phenyl, phenoxy and\no-blphenyl, respectively.\nThe relation between these parent species and the\nradicals is shown in figure l. This estimation procedure is based on the work\nof Forgeteg and Berces (ref. 4). In this method it is usual to assumethat the\nbond lengths and bond angles of the radical are identical to those of the parent. Also the radical\'s vibrational frequencies are taken to be the sameas\nthose of the parent molecule except that three frequencies are eliminated for\neach atom which appears in the parent molecule but not in the radical.\nIn some\ncases, where additional information about the radical is available, the assumed\nstructure and vibrational frequencies can be adjusted to take into account this\nextra information.\nOne of the difficulties\nwith this method of estimation is the selection of\nthe appropriate frequencies for elimination.\nThe reason for this is that a\nmolecule\'s frequencies correspond to vibrations of the molecule as a whole\nrather than vibrations of a particular bond. Naturally this introduces some\nuncertainty into the resulting properties.\nTo ascertain the degree of uncertainty one might try eliminating different frequencies or, perhaps, perform the\nestimation with a different parent species.\nComparisons of the results of our estimation of phenyl and phenoxy propertles (ref. 5) with estimates madeby Benson, et al. (refs. 6 and 7) are shown\nin tables I and II for entropy and heat capacity.\nOur estimation of the phenyl\nproperties from benzene and phenol agree surprisingly well wlth each other and\nwith the room temperature values estimated by Benson. Our estimates of the\nphenoxy properties estimated from phenol also agree very well with Benson\'s\nestimates which, for this species, were available over an extended temperature\nrange.\nNONIDEAL OI_UIION ODELS\nS\nM\nThe properties of fuels and oxidizers must be accurately known if combustion processes are to be modeled properly. Since reactants, especially\nfuels, are often multlcomponent, nonldeal, liquid solutions, it is desirable\n115\n\nto have accurate mathematical\n\nrepresentations\nof the composition\ndependence\nof\ntheir\nthermodynamic\nproperties.\nSuch representations\n(solution\nmodels)\ncan be\nused to analyze,\ninterpolate\nand extrapolate\nthermodynamic\nmeasurements\nof\nnonldeal\nsolutions.\nSolution\nmodels can also be used for the calculation\nof\nequilibria.\nThe utility\nof a solution\nmodel is directly\nproportional\nto tts\nability\nto handle both a wide range of nonldeal\nbehaviors\nand a great\ndiversity\nof multlcomponent\nsystems.\nMany solutton\nmodels have been proposed,\nbut most of them have a llmtted\ncapacity\nto treat\nnonldeallty.\nSome of them either\nare only able to deal wtth\nrelatively\nsmall deviations\nfrom tdealtty\nor cannot handle the complete\ncomposition\nrange.\nOthers are limited\nto binary\nor ternary\nsolutions.\nStill\nothers\nexhibit\nundesirable\nmathematical\nbehavior.\nMany contain\nnonlinear\nparameters\nwhich greatly\ncomplicate\nthe analysis\nof experimental\nmeasurements.\nI have proposed a solution\nmodel (ref.\n8) which\novercomes most of these difficulties.\nThe model ts applicable\nto solutions\ncontaining\nan arbitrary\nnumber\nof constituents.\nIt can treat\nhighly\nnontdeal\nsolutions,\nelectrolyte\nand nonelectrolyte,\nover the complete\ncomposition\nrange.\nIt has a relatively\nsimple\nmathematical\nform, and all\nparameters\nappear linearly\nin the model.\nFinally,\nIt contains\nboth ideal\nand regular\nsolutions\nas special\ncases.\nThe model\'s\nexpression\nfor the Gtbbs free energy Is given in equation\n(3) where\nG ts the\nGtbbs free energy,\nxt\nIs the mole fraction\nof species\n1, _(t)\nrepresents\nthe elementary\nsymmetric\nperature\nand pressure.\n\n"\n\nG = t_ 1 _(t)(Xl;N)\n=\n\n_\n_=l\n\nfunctions,\n\n_\nk=l\n\n/ (t)\n_)k\n\nand\n\n+\n\n(t)In\n=3k\n\n(t)\ngJk\n\nxj\n\n\' and\n\n._))\n\nare\n\nfunctions\n\nof\n\ntem-\n\n)\n\nxjx k\nN\nq_(t) (x t ;N)G(t)(xt)\n\n(3)\n\nt=l\n! shall\ndemonstrating\n(ref.\n9).\n\nillustrate\nhow It\n\nthe flexibility\nand the capabilities\nhandles\nthree\nvery different,\nhighly\n\nof the\nnonldeal\n\nmodel by\nsolutions\n\nThe first\nsolution\nis the ethanol-heptane\nbinary\nsystem, for which there\nare three\nsets of excess enthalpy\nmeasurements\nat 30 =C.\nThe solution\nis\nendothermlc,\nand measurements\nextend\nInto\nthe very dilute\nsolution\nrange.\nThe\nrepresentation\nof the measurements\nby the solution\nmodel Is shown In figure\n2.\nClearly\nthe model reproduces\nthe data very well\nover the complete\ncomposition\nrange,\nincluding\nthe steep gradient\nthat\noccurs In the dilute\nethanol\nregion.\nThe second solution\nIs the chloroform-ethanol\nbinary\nsolution\nat 50 "C, whose\nexcess enthalpy\nexhibits\nexothermlc\nbehavior\nover a part\nof the composition\nrange and endothermlc\nbehavior\nover the rest of the range.\nThe representation\nu, =,,= u\xc2\xb0_\xc2\xb0\n=,,u.,,\n,,_=,_\n3, and aga,,, +_\n*" =,,_ _=+= are _,oll -=--=\xc2\xa2\xc2\xb0-\xc3\xb7\xc2\xb0_ hu\nthe model.\nThese two solutions display very different behavior yet both can\nbe accommodated easily by the same solution model.\nThe first\nan electrolyte\nsystem extend\na temperature\nand the model\n\ntwo examples were nonelectrolyte\nsolutions.\nThe last example Is\nsolution of sodium chloride in water.\nMeasurements for thls\nfrom the very dilute solutions to saturated solutions and cover\nrange of almost 200 \xc2\xb0C.\nA comparison between the measurements\nare shown in figures 4 to 7, where the composition Is given as\nI16\n\nmolallty (g mol of solute/kg solvent).\nFigures 4 to 6 show the integral heats\nof solution while the excess heat capacity is shown in figure 7. Once again\nthe model gives more than an adequate representation of the experimental\nmeasurements.\nCHEMICAL\nREACTIONQUII.IBRIA\nE\nSometimesthe behavior of chemically reacting systems can be predicted\nquite well on the basis of chemical equilibrium.\nOver the years we have\ndeveloped a capability to perform computations reliably for several applications involving chemical reactions (refs. lO to 16).\nThe calculations are\nbased on free energy minimization and assume that the gaseous phase behaves\nideally, that the condensed phases are pure liquids and solids, and that the\nvolume of the condensed phases is negligible.\nThe computations can evaluate\ncomposition and, also, thermodynamic and transport properties for complex\nchemical systems involving up to 20 chemical elements and 600 reaction\nproducts.\nComposition and properties can be calculated for a thermodynamic\nstate\ndefined by pressure and one of the three variables:\ntemperature, enthalpy, or\nentropy.\nAlternatively,\nthe thermodynamic state can be specified by assigning\nthe volume and one of the three variables temperature, internal energy, or\nentropy.\nIn addition to the calculation of compositions and properties for an\nassigned thermodynamic\nstate, we can also compute the results for three dlfferent one-dlmenslonal\nflow processes neglecting heat transfer effects:\n(1) rocket nozzle expansions, (2) incident and reflected shocks, and\n(3) Chapman-3ouguet\ndetonations.\nThe rocket nozzle and shock calculations can\nbe performed for either equilibrium or frozen compositions.\nTable III is an\nexample of the calculation of the composition and of the thermodynamic\nand\ntransport properties for a simple system composed of hydrogen and oxygen at\nassigned pressures and temperatures.\nTable IV illustrates the results for the\ncalculation of a one-dlmenslonal\nshock In a hydrogen-oxygen\nmixture diluted\nwith argon.\n\nMODELING\n\nTHE SPARK-IGNITED\n\nINTERNAL\n\nCOMBUSTION\n\nENGINE\n\nThe spark-ignlted\ninternal combustion engine is an example of a chemically\nreacting system for which purely thermodynamic predictions are inadequate.\nA\nrealistic model must take into account not only thermodynamic properties but\nalso heat transfer rates, finite rate chemistry (chemical kinetics), and\nintake and exhaust flow rates.\nThese effects lead to a complex model and dlfficult calculations.\nA schematic representation of the operation of the spark-lgnlted\ninternal\ncombustion engine is shown in figure 8. Each cycle of the operation can be\ndescribed qualitatively\nby dividing the cycle into four parts, each part\nspanning\n_\nradlans (180 \xc2\xb0) of crankangle.\nEach part corresponds approximately\nto one of four processes taking place in the engine.\nThe parts are given names\nwhich are reasonably descriptive of the four processes:\n(1) the intake stroke,\n(2) the compression stroke, (3) the power stroke and (4) the exhaust stroke.\nA fuel-alr mixture enters the cylinder during the intake stroke and is compressed by the piston during the compression stroke.\nThe compressed working\nfluid Is ignited and expanded during the power stroke and is expelled from the\nI17\n\ncylinder\nduring the exhaust\nstroke.\nBecause matter\nenters\nand leaves\nthe\ncylinder,\nthe Internal\ncombustion\nengine\nIs an open system.\nFurthermore,\nthe\nburned gases are not completely\nexpelled\nfrom the cylinder,\nand thus the\nresidual\ngases provide\na "memory"\nof each cycle for the subsequent\ncycle.\nEach\ncycle occurs rapidly\nwith\na cycle\nrepetition\nrate which\nranges from about 25\nto 250 msec.\nThts cycle repetition\nrate Is comparable\nto the time scale for\nthe complex chemistry\nwhlch\ntakes place during\ncombustion,\nand thus\nthe rates\nof chemlcal\nreactions\nbecome Important.\nThe englne has a movable\nboundary\n(the\npiston)\nand a complex geometry.\nFtnally,\nthe operation\nof the engine Is\nnonrepeatable,\nand the engine experlences\n"cycle-to-cycle"\nvartatlons.\nThese\nfeatures\nof the Internal\ncombustion\nengine make Its modeltng\ndifficult\nIndeed.\nAdditionally,\noften there\nts Insufficient\nInformation\nto descrtbe\ncompletely\nthe details\nof the engine operation\neven If It were mathematlcally\nand numerIcally\npossible.\nI have chosen to develop\n(ref.\n17) a hierarchy\nof models of differing\ncomplexity\nIn order to accommodate the varying\namounts of Information\navailable\nIn particular\ncases.\nThe models\nrange from a simple model requiring\nonly\nthermodynamic\nproperties\n(modeling\nlevel\n1) to a complex model demanding full\ncombustion\nkinetics,\ntransport\nproperties\nand poppet valve flow characteristics\n(modeling\nlevel\n5).\nThe members of the hierarchy\nare classified\naccording\nto\ntheir\ntreatment\nof several\nImportant\nfeatures\nof the Internal\ncombustion\nengine\nas shown In table\nV.\nThe description\nof the operation\nof the Internal\ncombustlon\nenglne as betng divided\nInto\nfour parts\nIs adequate\nfor a qualltatlve\ndescription.\nIt Is, however,\nInadequate\nto descrlbe\nthe operation\nof a real\nengine correspond%ng\nto modeling\nat levels\n4 and 5.\nThe timing\nfor the Initiation\nand cessation\nof Important\nevents\nIn a more realistic\ncycle Is sketched\nIn ftgure\n9.\nThis figure,\noften\nreferred\nto as an Indicator\ndlagram,\nIs a plot\nof working\nflutd\npressure\nas a function\nof cylinder\nvolume for one complete\ncycle\nspanning 4e radlans\n(720 \xc2\xb0 ) of crankangle.\nIt should be noted that\nbetween stations\n7 and 2 the tntake\nand the exhaust\nvalves are simultaneously\nopen; this\ncorresponds\nto what Is called\nthe valve-overlap\nportion\nof the\ncycle.\nI shall\nuse the fuel-rich\ncombustlon\nof gaseous propane with\natr as an\nexample of modeling the Internal\ncombustion\nengtne at level\n5.\nThe air Is\nhumidified\n(75 percent\nrelatlve\nhumidity),\nand reclrculated\nexhaust\ngas ls\n10 percent\nof the charge.\nThe calculation\nwas a mult%cycle\ncalculation,\nbut\nonly cycle 11 Is shown.\nThe modeling\nparameters\nand a summary of results\nfor\ncycle 11 are given In table\nVI.\nThe combustion\nof propane was glven a full\nklnetlc\ntreatment\nusing a mechanism of 121 reactlons.\nFigures\n10 to 15 are\nplots\nof some of the calculated\nquantities.\nStraight\nline\nsegments are apparent on some of these\nplots.\nThese are not Indicative\nof the accuracy\nof the\ncalculations\nbut rather\nreflect\nboth the number of points\nsaved for plotting\nand the scale of the plots.\nFigure\n10 shows the lndlcator\ndiagram for\ncycle 11.\nFigure 11 shows the fractton\nof working\nfluid\nwhich\nhas been\nconverted\nto burned,\nbut still\nreactlng,\ngas during\nthe combustion\nphase of\n................................\n\n_\n\n_,,,V_,o_u,_a\n\na,_\n\n_,,uw,,\n\n,,,\n\ngure\n\n12\n\n(both\ntemperatures\nwere calculated\nduring\nthe combustion\nphase of the cycle).\nThe quenching\neffect\nof the endothermtc\nlnltlatlon\nreactions\nts clearly\nvisible.\nThe carbon monoxide concentration\nIn mole percent\nIs shown In figure\n13.\nHere we can easily\nsee the freezing\nof carbon monoxide early\nin the power\nstroke.\nA stmllar\nplot\nfor nitric\noxide,\nas parts\nper mtlllon\nIn mole\nfraction,\nalso shows freeztng\nIn figure\n14.\nFtnally,\ntn figure\n15 ts a\nhistory\nof the mass content\nof the cyltnder\nduring\ncycle 11.\n\nI18\n\nREFERENCES\nI.

The ratio of the outer to the inner area of the swlrler was 1.16\nthe venturi tube was mounted.\n\nSecondary\n\nNozzle With\n\nSmall\n\nSpray\n\nAngle\n\nFuel entered from the centrifugal nozzle in the ignition process in order\nto reduce or eliminate the probability of the sprayed fuel hitting the" wall.\n1wo kinds of small spray-angle secondary nozzles were studied.\n(See table II\nand fig. 5.) The spray angle was made small enough that the spray would not\nhit the inner wall of the premlxed pilot chamber.\nThus, the fuel spray cone\nwas not impaired.\nThe fuel-alr ratio was appropriate near the ignitor, and a\ngood starting performance was maintained (even if there was carbon deposition\nin the pilot chamber).\n\nRESUI_IS AND ANALYSIS\nAmount of Carbon\n\nDeposition\n\nin Premlxed\n\nPilot\n\nChamber\n\nlhe experimental results for various models are listed in table III.\n(Results for the original flame tube are included for comparison.)\nThe\nresults indicate that the venturi tube is the best structure for eliminating\ncarbon deposition.\nThere was almost no carbon deposition in the pilot chamber,\nand there was only a small amount of carbon deposition in the 20- to 30-mm\nposition downstream of the pilot chamber exit.\nThe objective of reducing carbon deposition in the pilot chamber was achieved.\nResults from the water analog test indicate that there was no reclrculation zone in the venturl tube.\nThe recirculation\nzone in the premlxed pilot\nchamber was located far downstream of the nozzle (fig. 6). The heat radiation\nfrom the flame-tube center to the nozzle was blocked outside of the venturi\ntube, thus reducing the temperature downstream of the nozzle.\nThis had a\ndeterminate\neffect on the reduction of the carbon particles.\nIt was for\n\n136\n\nthis reason that the amount of carbon deposition in the flame tube with a venfurl tube was obviously reduced.\nAdding an alr-film-coollng\nstructure in the premlxed pilot chamber helped\nreduce carbon deposition.\nThe reduction rate was usually as much as 20 to 30\npercent near the alr-film\nexits.\nBut, at the exits of the air films, the air\nvelocity was small, so was the alr-flow momentum. Nevertheless, the momentum\nof the fuel injected from the nozzle was rather large, so the film flow could\nnot prevent the fuel droplets from hitting the wall.\nIt is only possible for\nthe film air to bring away free carbon particles.\nFor this reason, this\nstructure is not very effective in reducing carbon deposition.\nGround Starting Performance\nThe results for five models at the ground starting ignition condition are\nshown in figures 7 and 8 where V2 is the inlet velocity of the combustion\nchamber. The curves of figure 7 indicate that there is an optimal value for\neach curve.\nThis velocity ranges from 15 to 20 m/sec.\nance was best for the flame tube with a model I venturl\n\nThe ignition\ntube.\n\nperform-\n\nFigure 8 indicates that the ground starting ignition performance\nimproved\ngreatly when model I and II nozzles were used under carbon deposition conditions in the premlxed pilot chamber.\nAt 17.5 m/sec of inlet velocity the\nfuel-lean ignition limit improved; the limiting alr-fuel ratio increased from\n36.8 to 63.2.\nIt is readily seen from these results that, under the carbon\ndeposition condition in the premlxed pilot chamber, adoption of a small-angle\nsecondary nozzle obviously improves the ground starting ignition performance.\nIn addition, it is known from the curves that when carbon is deposited in\nthe premlxed pilot chamber the alr-fuel ratio of the fuel-lean ignition limit\ndecreases from 47 to 36. This confirms that carbon deposition in the prem_xed\npilot chamber deteriorates the ground starting ignition performance.\n\nOutlet\nTable\n\nTemperature\n\nIV shows the test results\n\nField of Combustion\nof various\n\nChamber\n\nventurl-tube\n\nmodels.\n\nIt is\n\nreadily seen from the table that the size of the venturl tube mounted in the\npremlxed pilot chamber has a great effect on the combustor outlet temperature\nfield.\nThe outlet temperature distribution factor (OIDF, table IV) of the\nmodel V combustion chamber was 0.155; this was much better than that for the\noriginal model (0.229).\nlhe OIDF\'s of models I and II were similar to that of\nthe original model, but those of models IV and VI were inferior to that of the\noriginal model.\nlhe convergent angle of the front section and the outlet angle of the\nventurl tube have an obvious effect on the combustor outlet temperature distribution.\nWhen the convergent angle of the front section of the venturl tube\nincreases, the uniformity of the combustor outlet temperature field decreases.\nWhen the convergent angle was increased from 27o34 \' to 67o22 \', the OTDF\nincreased from 0.209 to 0.301.\nWhen the venturl-tube\noutlet angle became\nrather small, excessive fuel concentrated in the center of the flame tube;\nthis caused the temperature to rise in the center region and the outlet\n\n137\n\ntemperature\ndistribution\nof the venturt\ntube from\n\nto deteriorate.\nFor\n88 \xc2\xb0 to 56 \xc2\xb0 increased\n\nexample,\nreducing\nthe outlet\nthe OTDF from 0.155 to 0.301.\n\nangle\n\nAdoption\nof a secondary\nnozzle with\na small spray angle also improved\nthe\nuniformity\nof the combustor\noutlet\ntemperature\nfteldthe OTDF of model II was\n0.175,\nthe radial\ntemperature\ndistribution\nfactor\n(RTDF, table\nIV) was 0.077.\n\nStability\n\nof\n\nCombustion\n\nChamber\n\nFigure\n9 shows experlmental\nresults\nof the fuel-lean\nblowout\nllmlt\nfor\nvarious\nmodels.\nThe shapes of the curve\nare nearly\nthe same for various\nmodels.\nThe fuel-lean\nblowout\nllmtt\nfor the model II venturl\ntube was wider\nbecause this\nventurt\ntube had no throat\nsection;\nthus,\na small rectrculatlon\nzone was formed inside\nthe venturi\ntube.\nThe size of the rectrculatlon\nzone\nwas limited\n\nto\n\nthe\n\nnozzle\n\ndiameter\n\nrange\n\n(fig.\n\n10).\n\nThe fuel-lean blowout limits of the model III, IV, and V venturl tubes were\nnarrower.\nIt Is known from water analog test results that there is a highspeed rotating flow in the throat section of a venturl tube (fig. ll).\nThls\nunstable flow deteriorates the fuel-lean blowout limit.\nWhen a secondary nozzle with a small spray angle was adopted,\nlean blowout limit improved In the wlde velocity range.\n\nthe fuel-\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nThis\n\nstudy led to the following\n\nconclusions:\n\n(I) Adoption of the secondary nozzle wlth a small spray angle not only\nsolves the engine\'s starting ignition problem when there Is carbon deposition\nIn the premlxed pilot chamber but also extends the ground starting ignition\nrange and improves the uniformity of the combustor outlet temperature\nfield.\n(2) Adoption of an alr-fllm-coollng\nstructure reduces the amount of carbon\ndeposition on the wall of the premlxed pilot chamber.\nBut since there Is only\nlimited cooling alr available, it Is not easy to totally eliminate the carbon\ndeposition In the premlxed pilot chamber.\n(3) Mounting the venturl tube in the rear of the swlrler Is effective In\neliminating carbon deposition In the premlxed pilot chamber.\nBut the geometry\nof the venturl tube affects the uniformity of the _ombustor outlet temperature\nfield and the ground starting ignition performance; therefore, characteristic\ngeometric parameters of the venturl tube have to be elaborately adjusted.\n\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\nGu, M.Q.:\nStudy of Premlxed\nDecember 13, IgBO.\nLlu, Q.G.:\nFlame Tube.\n\nPilot Chamber\n\nInvestigation of Carbon\nApril 28, lgBO.\n\nWlth Alr Fllm Cooling\n\nDeposition\n\n138\n\nPerformance\n\nStructure.\n\non the Wall\n\nof a\n\nShang, M.Z.:\nFuel Nozzles.\n\nEffect on Igniting\nJune lO, lg82.\n\nPerformance\n\nYang, A.L.:\nReport of Water Analog\nof Flame Tubes.\nApril lO, 1982.\nYang, X.Z.:\nTest Report\nSeptember 20, 1981.\n\nTABLE\nModel\n\nof Ground\n\non Solving\n\nStarting\n\nI. - CHARACIERISIIC\nInlet\nDiameter,\n\nfor Different\n\nthe Carbon\n\nIgnition\n\nDIMENSIONS\n\nof a Combustion\n\nI\nII\nIII\nIV\nV\nVI\n\n42\n\n36\n25\n25\n20\n20\n15\n\nTABLE\nModel\n\nIf. - CHARACTERISllCS\n\nSpray\nangle,\n_sec\n\n\'\n\ndeg\n\nFuel\nflow,\n\n40\n45.3\n40\n35\n40\n15\n\nOF NOZZLE\n\n_double,\ndeg\n\nGf\n\nGfdouble,\nllter/hr\n\nsec\'\nllter/hr\n\nFuel supply pressure,\n\nFuel\n\nsupply pressure,\n\n= lO kg/cm 2\n\nP1\n\nPTdoubl e = 30 kg/cm 2\n\nsec\nOriginal\nI\nII\n\n56 \xc2\xb0\n36o32 \'\n56 \xc2\xb0\n56 \xc2\xb0\n88 \xc2\xb0\n0\xc2\xb0\n\n3O\n42\n3O\n3O\n3O\n15\n\n91\n51\n62\n\n24.6\n24.6\n23.16\n\n139\n\n103\nI00\nI00\n\nChamber.\n\nTUBE\n\n|\n\n602.4\n602.4\n593.4\n\nand\n\nFailure\n\nOutlet\ndiameter,\nmm\n\nOutlet\ncone\nangle,\ndeg\n\nmm\n\nmm\n\nTubes\n\nOepos%tlon\n\nOF VENIURI\n\nThroat\ndiameter,\n\nLength,\nmm\n\nFlame\n\nTABLE III.\n\nEFFECI\n\nOF VARIOUS MODELS\n\nON CARBON DEPOSLIION\n[Test conditions at inlet of combustion chamber:\nair pressure, P_, 6 kg/cm2;

Holdeman\nLewis Research Center\nCleveland, Ohlo\n\nThis paper presents experimental and analytical results of the mixing of\nsingle, double, and opposed rows of Jets wlth an isothermal or variabletemperature maln stream In a straight duct.\nThls study was performed to investigate flow and geometric variations typical of the complex, three-dlmenslonal\nflow field In the dilution zone of gas-turblne-englne\ncombustion chambers.\nThe principal results, shown experimentally\nand analytically, were the\nfollowing:\n(1) variations in orifice slze and spacing can have a significant\neffect on the temperature profiles; (2) similar distributions\ncan be obtained,\nindependent of orifice dlameter, if momentum-flux\nratio and orifice spacing are\ncoupled; (3) a flrst-order approximation of the mixing of jets wlth a variabletemperature maln stream can be obtained by superimposing the maln-stream and\njets-ln-an-lsothermal-crossflow\nprofiles; (4) the penetration of Jets issuing\nfrom slanted slots Is similar to that of Jets from circular holes, but the\nmixing is slower and is asymmetric wlth respect to the Jet centerplanes, which\nshift laterally wlth increasing downstream distance, (5) double rows of Jets\nglve temperature distributions\nsimilar to those from a single row of equally\nspaced, equal-area circular holes; (6) for opposed rows of Jets, wlth the orifice centerllnes In llne, the optimum ratio of orifice spacing to duct height\nIs one-half the optimum value for slngle-slde injection at the same momentumflux ratio; and (7) for opposed rows of Jets, with the orifice centerllnes\nstaggered, the optimum ratio of orifice spacing to duct height Is twice the\noptimum value for slngle-slde injection at the same momentum-flux\nratio.\nIn illustrating these results, the mean temperature measurements are compared wlth profiles calculated using an empirical model based on assumed vertical profile similarity and superposltlon and wlth distributions\ncalculated\nusing a three-dlmenslonal\nelllptlc code that had a standard k-_ turbulence\nmodel.\nThe empirical model predictions are very good within the range of the\ngenerating experiments, and the numerical model results, although they exhibit\ntoo little mixing, correctly describe the effects of the principal flow and\ngeometric variables.\n\nSYMBOLS\nAj/A m\n\nJet to maln-stream\nfor one-slde\n\narea\n\ninjection\n\nratio, A_/A\nm-\n\nand (_/2)/[(S/Ho)(Ho/D)\n\ninjection\nC\n\n(S/Ho)_-\',\n\neq.

The effect on the dimensionless\ntemperature distributions of varying the jet to maln-stream density ratio, the momentum-flux\nratio,\nand the orifice size and spacing are presented in reference 2.\nFrom the data in reference I, an empirical model was developed (refs. 4\nand 5) for predicting the temperature field downstream of a row of jets mixing\nwith a confined crossflow.\nThe effects of separately varying the independent\nflow and geometric variables and the relations among these variables which\noptimize the mixing are reviewed in reference 12.\nlhis study was conducted\nusing an interactive microcomputer\nprogram that is based on the empirical model\nof reference 5 ....\n..,\n151\n\nThe results of these investigations may be summarizedas follows:\n(I)\nm_xlng improves with increasing downstream distance; (2) the momentum-flux\nratio is the most significant flow variable; (3) the effect of density ratio\nis small at constant momentum flux ratio; (4) at any given momentum-flux\nratio, decreasing orifice spacing while maintaining\na constant orifice diameter\nreduces penetration and increases lateral uniformity;\n(5) increasing orifice\ndiameter while maintaining a constant spaclng-to-dlameter\nratio improves penetration but increases lateral nonunlformlty;\n(6) increasing orifice diameter\nat a constant orifice spacing increases the magnitude of the temperature difference, but jet penetration and profile shape remain similar; (7) profiles for\nconditions with equivalent coupling of orifice spacing and momentumflux\nratio\nshow similar distributions; and (8) smaller momentum-flux\nratios (larger spacing) require a greater downstream distance for equivalent mixing.\nResults from the experiments\nin references 17 to 19 that are considered\nin this paper include the effects of variations in orifice size and spacing,\ncoupled spacing and momentum-flux\nratio, variable temperature main stream,\nnoncircular orifices, and double and opposed rows of Inllne and staggered jets.\nAlso, temperature field measurements\nfrom several experiments are compared with\ndistributions\ncalculated using an empirical model based on assumed vertical\nprofile similarity and superposltlon\n(refs. 17 to 19) and using a threedimensional\nelliptic code with a standard k-_ turbulence model (ref. 14).\nThe\nresults show the capability of these models to predict the effects of the\nprincipal flow and geometric variables.\nA more complete presentation of the experimental\nresults and a discussion\nof the empirical modeling performed in this study are given in references l,\n4, and ll to 19. Selected experimental and analytical results from these\nstudies and from reference 14 are also given in references 2, 5, and 20 to 23.\n\nFLOW FIFI_D DESCRIPIION\nFigure l shows a schematic of the dilution Jet flow field for jet injection from the top wall.\nThe temperature field results are presented in threedimensional oblique views of the temperature difference ratio\ne:\nT\n\nm\n\ne-1\n\n- l\n\n-T\nm\n\n(1)\nj\n\nA sequence of experimental profiles of this parameter\ntions downstream of the injection plane is shown in figure\ndimensional plots the temperature distribution\nis shown in\nnormal to the main flow direction\nx. The coordinates\ny\ntively, normal and parallel to the orifice row. Note that\n\nat several Ioca2.\nIn the threethe\ny,z-planes\nand\nz are, respecthe Jet fluid is\n\nidentified by the larger values of the\ne parameter (i.e., e = 1 if T = lj,\nand\ne = 0 if l = Tm).\nlhe equilibrium\ne\nfor any configuration\nis equal\nto the fraction of the total flow entering through the dilution jets wj/w l.\nlhe orifice configurations\ninvestigated are shown in figure 3. The primary independent geometric variables for each orifice configuration\nare the\nspacing between adjacent orifices\nS, the orifice diameter\nD (for nonclrcular\norifices, th_s is taken as the diameter of a circle of equal area), and, for\ndouble rows, the axial spacing between rows\nSx.\nlhese are expressed in\n152\n\ndimensionless form as the ratio of the orifice spacing to duct height S/Ho,\nthe ratio of the duct height to orifice diameter Ho/D, and the ratio of the\naxial spacing to the duct height Sx/HO.\nEXPERIMENIAL\nCONSIDERAIIONS\nlhe dilution-jet\nmixing characteristics were determined by measuring temperature and pressure distributions\nwith a vertical-rake\nprobe positioned at\ndifferent axial and lateral stations.\nThis probe had 20 thermocouple elements.\nA 20-element total-pressure rake and a 20-element statlc-pressure rake were\nlocated nominally 5 mm(0.05 HO) on each side of the thermocouple rake. The\ncenter-to-center\nspacing between sensors on each rake was 0.05 HO.\nlhis probe traversed a matrix of 48 to 64 z,x-plane survey locations.\nlhe flow field was mappedin the z-direction over a distance of l or 1.5 times\nthe hole spacing S at intervals of S/lO. For most tests, the x,y-plane\ncontaining the orifice centerllne (centerplane) was at the center of the span\nsurveyed; that is, data surveys were from midplane to midplane.\nMeasurementsin the x-dlrectlon were madeat up to five planes with\n0.25 < X/H0 < 2. Because the objective in this application is to identify\ndilution-zone configurations that will provide a desired mixing pattern within\na given combustor length, the downstreamstations are defined in intervals of\nthe duct height H rather than intervals of the orifice diameter D.\n0\nFLOW\nFIELDMODELS\nEmpirical\nlhe empirical model for the temperature field downstream of Jets mixing\nwith a confined crossflow is based on the observation that properly nondlmenslonallzed vertical temperature profiles can be expressed in the following\nself-similar\nform (ref. 5) for any location in the flow field:\n\nE yyc21\n\ne - em_n\n+ - e xp - In 2\nec - emTn\nwhere\n\ne\n-\n\nis the temperature\n_\n\ndifference\n\nratio\n\n(2)\n\nW\xc2\xb1\nI/2\n\nat vertical\n\nlocation\n\ny, and\n\n-\n\neml n, emi n, Wl/2, Wl/2, ec, and\n\nYc\n\nare scaling\n\nparameters\n\nas shown\n\nin\n\nfigure 4. Correlations\nhave been developed for each of these in terms of the\nindependent variables\nJ, S/D, Ho/D, Z/S, and\nx/H O. The correlations\nin\nreference 5 for a single row of jets in a uniform temperature crossflow have\nbeen extended for predicting the temperature field downstream of single, double, or opposed rows of Jets, either Inllne or staggered, injected into an\nisothermal or nonJsothermal\nmain stream, with or without flow-area convergence\n(refs. 17 to Ig).\n\n153\n\nNumerical\nlhe numerical code used in this investigation\nis based on the USARTL\nthree-dlmenslonal,\nfully elliptic, turbulent flow model (ref. 24) and uses\npressure and velocity as the main hydrodynamic\nvariables.\nThis code, or slm%far versions thereof, has been used in previous validation and assessment\nstudies (refs. 14 to 16).\nThe governing equations are represented by flnlte-dlfference\napproximations on a staggered grid system.\nThe differencing\ntechnique employed is\nhybrid for convective terms with central differencing\nof all other terms.\nThe\nveloclty-pressure\ncoupling is handled by the SIMPLE algorithm of Patankar and\nSpalding (refs. 25 and 26).\nUniform velocities and mass flow rates were used\nat all inflow boundaries.\nThe code contained a conventional\nk-c turbulence\nmodel, and standard values of the constants\nCD, Cl, and\nC2 were used\n(i.e., CD = o.og, C1 = 1.44, C2 = l.g2).\nThe rms turbulence intensity was\nchosen to be 4.5 percent of the local mean velocity, the inlet length scale was\n2 percent of the Jet diameter and duct height for the Jet and main stream,\nrespectively,\nand the turbulent Prandtl number was 0.9 for all calculations.\n\nRESULTS\n\nAND DISCUSSION\n\nThe following paragraphs describe the experimental\nresults and compare\nthem with those of the empirical and numerical model calculations,\nand illustrate the effects of the primary independent variables.\nThe flow and geometry\nconditions corresponding\nto the figures shown are given in table I.\n\nOrifice\n\nSize and Spacing\n\nAt constant orifice area, changes in orifice size and spacing can have a\nsignificant influence on the\ne profiles.\nThis is shown by the experimental\nprofiles in figure 5 where jets from closely spaced small orifices underpenetrate and remain near the injection wall (fig. 5(a)), and Jets from widely\nspaced larger orifices overpenetrate\nand impinge on the opposite wall\n(fig. 5(b)).\nIn this figure, and in several others in which the orifice\nspacing is different for different parts of the figure, a duct cross-sectlon\nis included to indicate the region for which data are shown.\nlhe data for these conditions, at x/H 0 = 0.5, are compared with calculated distributions\nin figure 6. The empirical model reproduces the data very\nwell in the small orifice case because the data are consistent with the major\nassumption in the empirical model, namely that all vertical temperature distributions can be reduced to similar Gausslan profiles.\nThe empirical model\ndoes not do as well in the larger orifice case, however, because the impingement of the jets on the opposite wall results i,, vertical --^_v,u,...\n,,_ w,,_,_,,\n.\nare\nnot similar.\nThe numerical model calculations were made with approximately\n20 000\nnodes.\nAlthough these are in qualitative agreement with the data, they show\ntemperature gradients that are too steep, especially in the transverse direction.\nUnderpredictlon\nof the mixing was also seen in the single-Jet calculations of reference 13

locations), and this is not accounted for\nwhen the distributions are superimposed.\nThis becomes apparent if the local\nmaln-stream\ntemperature\nTm(Y), is used in the definition of e\nin\nequation (1).\nIn the variable temperature maln-stream case, the numerical model results\nagree well with the experimental data, especially on the jet centerplane,\nbut\nthe transverse mixing is underpredlcted,\nas in the corresponding\nisothermal\nmaln-stream case shown in figure 8(b).\n\nSlanted\nF_gure ll shows experimental\ne distributions for slanted slots\n\nSlots\n\nand calculated

in figure 8(b).\nAs noted in reference 23, the penetration\nand mixing of jets from\nthe slanted slots are noticeably less than those of Jets from the circular\nholes.\nThe normally symmetric vortex pair is asymmetric in this case, as is\napparent in the experimental profiles in figure II (and in the figures in\nref. 23). These profiles also show that the centerplanes of the jets shift\nlaterally with increasing downstream distance.\nThe empirical model calculations\ninclude a modification\nto account for the\nobserved centerplane shift, but they do not model the asymmetry (refs. 19\nand 23).\nThe numerical calculations for this case exhibit both the centerplane\nshift and the asymmetry, and they are good in the context of the qualitative\nagreement seen throughout the comparisons given in this paper.\n\nDouble\n\nRows of Holes\n\nFigure 12 shows experimental and calculated temperature distributions\nfor\nan orifice plate with two Inline rows of jets (Sx/H 0 = 0.5) from circular\norifices.\nIt was observed from the experimental profiles in reference 23 that\nthe two configurations have very similar temperature distributions,\nand this\nis seen in the calculated profiles as well.\nIn this case the empirical model\ncalculations are derived by superimposing\nthe distributions\nfrom the two rows.\nBoth experimental and calculated temperature distributions\nare shown in\nfigure 13 for a double-row configuration\nwhen\nSx/H 0 = 0.25 and the trailing\nrow has twice as many orifices as the lead row.\nNote that the orifice area is\n.....................\n_^" in\nUUIII\nI\nu vw\nthe same for\nDoLr!\nFOW_\xe2\x80\xa2\nurue_e pruTules\nshow the _--_,,a, I_\nu,_ _^\n_,,= I=_\n^_\nestablishing\nthe jet penetration\nand flrst-order profile shape (ref. 23).

The density ratio, momentum-flux\nratio, orifice\nspacing, and orifice size were the primary independent variables.\nThis table\nalso gives ratios that are derived from the primary variables:\nthe orifice to\nmain-stream\narea ratio, the jet-to-total mass flow split, and the parameter\ncoupling the spacing and momentum-flux\nratio.\nNot all combinations of the\nprimary variables in the table were tested; only those combinations which are\nwithin the range given for the derived variables represent conditions that are\nwithin the range of the experiments.\nExamining the results in figures 5 to 17 in the context of equation (3)\nsuggests that, in general, the empirical model provides good temperature field\npredictions for slngle-slde injection when l < C < 5. Similarly, good predictions are obtained for opposed Inllne Jets provided that 0.5 < C < 2.5. This\nmodel does not work well for impinging flows because the experimental\ntemperature distributions\nare not consistent with the assumption of Gausslan profile\nsimilarity in the empirical model.\nThe experimental profiles for conditions\ngiving optimum mixing in opposed staggered-Jet\nconfigurations\nare also somewhat\nat variance with the model assumptions;\nin these cases, satisfactory agreement\n\nA major weakness of the empirical model used here in (refs. 17 to 19) and\nin previous versions (refs. 4 and 5) is that the form of the correlations precludes their use for seml-conflned\nflows (large\nHo/D\nor S/D), slngle-jet\nflows, or flows in which it is known a priori that the primary assumptions\nin\nthe model will be invalid.\n\n158\n\nNumerical\nlhe numerical model is not subject to the inherent limitation\nof the\nempirical model regarding profile shape and confinement. Thus, threedimensional codes can provide calculations for complex flows for which the\nassumptions in the empirical model are known to be invalid or outside the range\nof available experiments. Furthermore, numerical models provide calculations\nfor all flow field parameters of interest, not just those that happen to have\nbeen empirically correlated.\nlhe numerical calculations correctly show the trends which result from\nvariation of the independent flow and geometric variables, although the results\nconsistently exhibit too little\nmixing. The numerical model calculations for\nthe slanted slots and staggered Jet cases are encouraging because the experimental data for these cases show profiles that are not consistent with the\nprimary assumptions in the empirical model.\nlhe numerical calculations performed are shown to be grid sensitive, and\nfalse diffusion is known to be present. Uncertainties also exist in these\ncalculations regarding the validity of turbulence model assumptions and due to\nunmeasured(and hence assumed) boundary conditions.\nThe results shown here are\nnot intended to represent the best agreement possible from numerical models at\nthis time. Better temperature field agreement could undoubtedly have been\nachieved by adjusting model constants and/or inlet boundary conditions.\nBut,\nsince this was not necessary to satisfy the present objective of evaluating the\npotential of these codes vis-a-vis combustor dilution zone flow fields, and\nbecause the meantemperature was the only parameter compared, no adjustments\nwere made.\nlhus, as with previous assessmentsin references 14 to 16, threedimensional calculations, such as those in this paper, should be considered as\nonly qualitatively\naccurate at this time, and three-dlmenslonal codes of this\ntype are useful primarily in guiding design changes or in perturbation analyses. lhe three-dlmenslonal code used herein, although sufficiently\npromising\nto justify\nfurther development and assessment, is not a practical tool for\ngeneral engineering use in its present form. Codes with improved numerics,\naccuracy, and turbulence models should provide more quantitative predictions.\nCONCLUSIONS\nlhe principal\nare as follows:\n\nconclusions from the experimental results\n\nI.

With the sameorifice spacing in (at least) the lead row, double rows\nof Jets have temperature distributions\nsimilar to those from a single row of\nequally spaced, equlvalent-area circular orifices.\n6. For opposed rows of jets, with the orifice centerllnes in llne, the\noptimum ratio of orifice spacing to duct height is one-half the optimum value\nfor slngle-slde injection at the samemomentum-flux ratio.\n7. For opposed rows of Jets with the orifice centerllnes staggered, the\noptimum ratio of orifice spacing to duct height is twice the optimum value for\nslngle-slde injection at the samemomentum-flux ratio.\nTemperature field measurementsfrom the experiments cited previously are\ncomparedwith distributions\ncalculated using an empirical model based on\nassumedvertical profile similarity\nand superposltlon and with calculations\nmadeusing a three-dlmenslonal elliptic\ncode with a standard k-c turbulence\nmodel. The results can be summarizedas follows:\nEmpirical model calculations provide very good results for modeled parameters within the range of experiments whenever the primary assumptions in the\nmodel are satisfied.\nThree-dlmenslonal code calculations madein thls study correctly approximate the trends which result from varying the independent flow and geometric\nvariables, but they consistently exhibit too little\nmixing. (The advantage of\nthese models is that they can predict all flow field quantities,\nflows outside\nthe range of experiments, or flows where empirical assumptions are invalid.)\nNumerical calculations should yield more quantitative predictions with\nimprovements in numerics, accuracy, and turbulence models.\nREFERENCES\nI.

Blttker\nNASA Lewis Research Center\nCleveland, Ohio\n\nThis paper describes NASA Lewis\' studies of complex reacting systems at\nhigh temperature.\nThe changes which occur are the result of many different\nchemical reactions occurring at the same time.\nBoth an experimental and a\ntheoretical\napproach are needed to fully understand what happens in these systems.\nThe latter approach is discussed herein.\nWe present the differential\nequations which describe the chemical and thermodynamic\nchanges, and we\ndescribe their solution by numerical techniques using a detailed chemical\nmechanism.\nSeveral different comparisons of computed results with experimental measurements\nare also given.\nThese include the computation of (1) species\nconcentration\nprofiles in batch and flow reactions, (2) rocket performance\nin\nnozzle expansions, and (3) pressure versus time profiles in hydrocarbon\nignition processes.\nThe examples illustrate the use of detailed kinetic computations to elucidate a chemical mechanism and to compute practical quantltles\nsuch as rocket performance, ignition delay times, and ignition lengths in flow\nprocesses.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nFor many years Lewis has been studying complex, reacting gas-phase systems at high temperature.\nThe changes that occur in such systems are the\nresult of many individual chemical reactions occurring at the same time.\nWe\nuse a two-step approach to understand what happens in such a system:\n(1)\nexperimental measurement of the temporal changes in temperature, pressure, or\ncomposition of the system, and (2) theoretical computation of these changes in\nan attempt to match the experimental results.\nThis report describes our work\nin the computation of complex-system\nchemical kinetics as focused on combustion systems.\nBrabbs describes our experlmental efforts in his paper for this\nsymposium.\nEarly attempts to compute the progress of complex reactions\ninvolved various simplifications.\nThese were of two types:\n(1) one or two\nglobal reactions were substituted for the actual set of many individual,\nsimultaneous\nreactions which occur in a gaseous system with several species\npresent, and (2) reactions involving some of the very reactive atoms and radicals were assumed to be very fast and, therefore, always in chemical equilibrium.\nDifferential equations for the rates of change of a few key species\nwere solved analytically.\nAlthough both of these approaches have had limited\nsuccess, they only explain some of the general features of a complex reaction.\nThey are, at best, simplified approximations\nof the actual process, which are\nonly valid under a limited set of conditions.\nThe most fruitful approach to\ncomplex kinetics computations\nis to numerically integrate a system of differential equations derived from the laws of conservation of mass, energy, and\n(if flow is involved) momentum.\nThese differential\nequations involve the\nrates of change of species concentrations\n_I (moles per unit mass of mixture) and temperature\nT, and they may also involve density\np and velocity\nV for a flow process.\nWhen these differential equations are solved, a set of\nindividual reactions is assumed to occur simultaneously\namong all the species,\nand these reactions are usually assumed to be reversible (with the ratio of\n\n175\n\nthe forward to reverse\nfor any reaction).\n\nrate constant\n\nbeing\n\nequal\n\nto the equilibrium\n\nconstant\n\nThere are two ways to use these detailed kinetic computations.\nFirst,\nthey may be used to elucidate a reaction mechanism or to determine a single\nunknown rate constant in conjunction with experimental data.\nOn the other\nhand, they may be used wlth a known mechanism to compute practical combustion\nquantities such as\n(1)\n(2)\n(3)\n(4)\n\nKinetic rocket or jet engine performance\nCompos_tlon of engine exhaust gases\nIgnition delays in combustible mixtures\nIgnition lengths and nozzle performance\nin supersonic\n\nExamples of some of these computations\nin this paper.\n\nperformed\n\nGENERAL\n\nat NASA\n\nLewis\n\ncombustion\nare given\n\nTHEORY\n\nA reacting system

differentiated\nto give a set of differential equations for the variation of the concentrations\nand temperature with time.\nFor a flow reaction,\ndifferential\nequations for density and velocity will also be obtained.\nThe\nresulting system of equations is solved numerically in combination with the\nideal gas equation of state:\n\nP :\n\nwhere\n\np\n\nis the pressure\n\npressure\n\nd_ i\n\nand

solve these equations.\nAlthough the differential equations are inherently\nstable, they have widely different time constants for relaxation to their\nfinal equilibrium solution.\nTherefore, the step sizes required for solution\nstability are prohibitively\nsmall.\nThese systems of equations are called\nstiff, and the problem of solving them accurately has been studied for many\nyears.\nSeveral new implicit integration methods have been developed for solving these stiff equations.\nAlthough they have been quite successful in\nimproving the accuracy and efficiency of the solutions, there is still a need\nfor additional development of better methods.\nProblems of accuracy and of\nefficient step-slze selection can still arise.\nMethods need to be developed\nfor automatic selection of the optimum integration parameters.\nTherefore,\nresearch is actively proceeding at many institutions to develop more efficient\nintegration methods (refs. l to 4).\nThere is another kinetic combustion model of interest to practical engine\ndesigners - namely, highly backmlxed reacting flow in what is usually called\nthe well-stlrred reactor.\nWe assume the limiting condition of

This example illustrates the use of kinetics\ncomputations\nin obtaining better rate-constant\nvalues for one or two key reactions when all other reactions in a mechanism are fairly well known.\nOf\ncourse, we cannot say that we have uniquely determined both reaction rate constants since we have two adjustable parameters.\nBut we have put limits on\ntheir uncertainty.\nOf course, this type of exercise can only be done when the\nexperimental\nvariable being matched by computation is sensitive to small variations in the uncertain rate constants,\nlhls brings up the following general\nquestion:\nFor a given change in any rate constant of the reaction mechanism,\nhow much does each computed variable change?\nThis is the relatively new\nfield of study in chemical kinetics called sensitivity analysis.\nIn practice, even through a chemical mechanism may contain more than lO0\nreactions, only the rate constants of 15 or 20 may significantly\naffect the\ncomputed results when their values are changed.\nRecently, methods have been\ndeveloped to systematically compute these effects in the form of sensitivity\ncoefficients\n(refs. 9 to ll). This computation is performed along with the\nchemlcal-klnetlcs\ncomputation.\nThe results of the latter computation are used\nas input to solve a second set of differential\nequations whose unknowns are\nsensitivity coefficients of the form\nkR ac I\n(12)\nSiR - cl ak R\n\nkRk m\n\n2\na ci\n\ncl\n\nakRak m\n\n(13)\nTiR m -\n\nThe flrst-order coefficient\nSiR\neffectively gives the percentage change in\nc i (Ith\nconcentration variable) for a given percentage change in the rate\nconstant of reaction\n_. The second-order coPfflclent\nTIRm\ngives the effect\n180\n\non\n\ncI of changes in both\nk_ and\nkm.\nIt is now recognized that a sensitivity analysis must be performed for any complex reaction in order to pinpoint\nthe important reaction paths and obtain a good understanding\nof the reaction\nmechanism.\n\nComputation\n\nof Rocket\n\nPerformance\n\nOne of the first uses of chemical kinetic computations was in the computation of rocket performance\nusing a one-dimensional\nflow model.\nThis performance is measured by the velocity of the hot gas at the nozzle exit point.\nAs the gas expands and cools, its velocity (i.e., kinetic energy) is kept as\nhigh as possible by chemical recombination reactions which occur in the nozzle. These reactions convert high-potential-energy\natoms and radicals into\nlow-energy stable molecules.\nMaximum performance is obtained if these reactions maintain equilibrium conditions in the very short nozzle-resldence\ntime.\nBut this is often not the case since the finite rates of the reactions are not\nfast enough.\nBy knowing the rate constants for the important recombination\nprocesses one can compute kinetic performance that more accurately and reallstically reflects the experimentally\nmeasured performance.\nAn example of this\nis shown in figure 2 for the oxygen difluoride - dlborane system (ref. 12).\nThe three curves of performance as a function of oxldant/fuel\nratio (fig. 2(b))\nshow the maximum and minimum theoretical performance\n(assuming equilibrium and\nfrozen conditions) as well as the kinetlcally limited performance.\nThe latter\nagrees rather well with actual measurements corrected for various losses.\nThe\nreaction mechanism used is shown in table I. This system is interesting\nbecause only one reaction rate constant has to be accurately known in order to\ncompute the kinetic curve.\nThis is the recombination\nof hydrogen atoms to\ngive molecular hydrogen.\nThis fact was determined by a simple sensitivity\nanalysis.\nComputed performance is unchanged for wide variations of the other\nrate constants.\nThe reason for this situation can be seen fromthe\nheat\nrelease data in table I. The hydrogen atom recombination\naccounts for well\nover 50 percent of the heat release in the process, and this, of course, controls performance.\n\nTwo-Stage\n\nWell-Stirred\n\nReactor\n\nThe practical use of the well-stlrred reactor model of GCKP84 is illustrated by its simulation of a two-stage turbulent combustor.\nA theoretical\nand experimental\nstudy of two-stage, rich-lean combustion as a method of controlling nitrogen oxide emissions was performed at Lewis.\nThis technique was\nsuggested as a way of reducing the conversion of the organic nitrogen compounds\nin hydrocarbons\n(fuel-bound nitrogen) to nitric oxide during combustion.\nThe\nobjective of the work was to study the effect of operating conditions on emlss_ons of both nitrogen oxides (NOx) and carbon monoxide (CO) (ref. 13).\nBoth the nitrogen and the hydrogen content of the fuel were changed to simulate coal-derlved syncrude fuels,\nlhese fuels contain high percentages of\naromatic hydrocarbons and therefore have a lower hydrogen-to-carbon\nratio than\ntoday\'s petroleum-based\nfuels.\nExperiments were performed in the two-stage\nflame-tube apparatus shown in figure 3. lhe fuels were mixtures of propane,\ntoluene, and pyrldlne blended to give a range of hydrogen and nitrogen contents.\nThe prlmary-zone equivalence\nratio was varied from 0.7 to about 1.8.\nlhe products of flrst-stage combustion were rapidly diluted with air injection\n\n181\n\nand burned at a final equivalence ratio of 0.5. The final NO and COconcenx\ntrations were measured. The two-stage flame tube was modeled analytically\nby\na two-stage stlrred-reactor\ncomputation closely simulating the experimental\nfuels.\nInstantaneous mixing of the secondary dilution air was assumed. A\ndetailed chemical mechanismwas used for propane and toluene oxidation and for\nNO formation. The fuel-bound nitrogen was input as nitrogen atoms and all\nx\nmixing and heat-transfer effects were neglected. This very simplified model\nof a quite complex process was able to predict most of the observed trends of\nNO and COformation with variation of nitrogen and hydrogen concentrations\nx\nin the fuel.\nThe model\'s prediction of other trends, which were not measured\nexperimentally, gave additional information about the advantages and disadvantages of using this rlch-lean combustion for emissions control.\nA comparison\nof someexperimental and computed results for NO and COconcentration as a\nx\nfunction of primary equivalence ratio is given in figures 4 and 5. The simple\nmodel qualitatively\npredicts the observed trends.\nIt can be seen that using a\nrich primary equivalence ratio does reduce NO formation very significantly.\nx\nHowever, at the sametime, this technique increases the formation of CO, which\nis also undesirable. Thus, one set of conditions cannot minimize both pollutants, and tradeoffs will have to be madeto obtain desired emissions levels\nfor any practical situation.\nThis work has shown that a simple kinetic model\ncan sometimesbe used to qualitatively\nexplain the observed trends in a highly\ncomplicated combustion system.\nIgnition\n\nDelays in Benzene-Oxygen-Argon\nMixtures\n\nOur current work involves the study of the mechanismof hydrocarbon oxidation.\nWeare studying the allphatlc hydrocarbons by measuring ignition delays\nand concentration profiles during the shock-heated oxidation of hydrocarbonoxygen-argon mixtures.

The airflow from the compressor\nIs divided Into two streams:\none stream goes to ejector 7 to create a lowpressure exhaust condition for the test section; the other stream goes through\nvalve l, flow-oriflce meter 2, air heater 3, control valve 4, and plenum chamber 5 into test section 6. After leaving the test section the combustion\nproducts are cooled by water injection.\nThe hot gas Is exhausted into the\nambient through the ejector.\nThe test rlg assembly Is shown In figure 2. It Is a rectangular duct\n300 mm by 175 mm. The piloted flameholder Is mounted inside the test section\nby bolts.\nFlame extinction Is recorded through a quartz window by a flamedetection device.\nFlame extinction can also be observed visually.\nThe ignition in the primary zone is provided by a hlgh-energy\nignitor of 12 J. The\ncombustible mixture in the secondary zone Is ignited by flame propagation\nfrom\nthe primary zone.\nThe inlet flow Is measured by the static pressure tap, the\nstagnant pressure tube, and the chromel-alumel\nthermocouple.\nThe outlet temperature Is monitored by a platlnum/platlnum-rhodlum\nthermocouple.\nOutlet\nstagnant pressure Is measured by three water-cooled\nstagnant pressure probes;\neach has three measuring points.\nThe transient pressure is measured by an\nInductlon-type\npressure transducer (CyG-l, 0 to l.O kg/cm 2) wlth an LR-I\ncarrier wave amplifier and an Sc-60 ultraviolet oscilloscope.\nThe fuel flow\nrate is measured by a turblne-type flowmeter wlth a digital frequency\nindicator.\nThe fuel Is injected through a spray bar. There Is one spray bar In the\nprimary zone.\nThe total length of the bar Is 280 mm.\nThere are slx pairs of\nholes (0.4 mm In dlam) on the bar at an intersection angle of 60 \xc2\xb0. In the\nsecondary zone there are slx spray bars.\nThe two bars In the center have four\npairs of holes (0.35 mm In dlam) at an intersection angle of 30\xc2\xb0; the other\nfour spray bars have four holes (0.35 mm In dlam) each.\nFuel injection In the\nsecondary zone is In the counterflow direction.\nThe test configurations\nof\npiloted flameholders are shown In figure 3.\n192\n\nTESTMETHOD\nThe test conditions were as follows:\nl_\n\n60 to\n\n70 \xc2\xb0C or\n\n500 \xc2\xb0C\n\nM2\n\n0.23\n\nP_\n\n0.25 to 1.2 kg/cm 2\n\nThe test procedures were as follows:\nFirst, the air supply was adjusted to\nmaintain the inlet conditions of P_, M2, and\nT_ as specified.\nAfter the\nprimary zone had been ignited the ejector air supply was adjusted to maintain\nP_, M2, and T_ constant.\nThen the fuel flow in the primary zone\nGfp\nwas\nincreased until fuel-rlch flameout occurred.\nAfter that, the _rlmary zone was\nreignited at the specified inlet condition and\nP_, M2, and\nT2 were kept\nconstant.\nFinally, the fuel flow was reduced until there was fuel-lean flame\nextinction.\nBefore ignition, the pressure drop between the inlet and outlet\nwas measured.\nDuring ignition the peak pressure, the fuel-alr mixture in the\nsecondary zone, and the pressure oscillation were also recorded.\n\nRESULTS\n\nAND DISCUSSION\n\nPeak Pressure\n\nMeasurements\n\nAs shown in figure 4, the peak pressure rise during ignition is usually\nlower than lO percent of the inlet pressure (AP2/P _ < TO percent).\nThe\npeak pressure rise in the augmentor is normally related to the amount of fuel\ninjected (as in these tests).\nSince the ignition is realized in a small volume, the amount of fuel necessary for ignition is small.\nThus, the peak pressure is lower than that for normal augmentor ignition.\nThis proves that using\na piloted flameholder makes it easier to obtain a soft ignition in a turbofan\naugmentor.\nPressure\n\nOscillation\n\nMeasurements\n\nPressure oscillation measurements were performed under the same conditions\nas the peak pressure measurements.\nThe amount of fuel injected in the primary\nzone has a very strong\neffect on the pressure oscillation\nin the augmentor\nduring ignition in the secondary zone (figs. 5(a) and (b)).\nIt has been shown\nthat, with the same amount of fuel injected in the secondary zone, the pressure\noscillation during the onset of secondary combustion varies with the amount of\nfuel injected in the primary zone.\nIt is clear that there is an optimum fuel\ninjection in the primary zone which minimizes the pressure oscillation during\nsecondary zone ignition.\nFlow Resistance\nFigure 6 shows the variation of the pressure loss coefficient with the\nReynolds number\nRe for different configurations.\nWhen\nRe\nincreases, the\npressure loss coefficient\nC decreases slightly.\nThe pressure loss coefficient\nC also decreases with the increase of gap height\nh. The pressure loss\ncoefficient\nC for a V-gutter is slightly lower than that for a semlspherical\nshape.\n193\n\nEffect of Inlet\n\nFlow Distortion\n\nlhe inlet flow distortion is shown in figure 7. Figure 8 shows the effect\nof inlet flow d_stortlon on flame stabilization.\nWhen the inlet flow is distotted, the range of flame stabilization\nis narrowed, and the peak value of the\nstabilization\nparameter is also reduced.\nFor instance, at\nP_ = 0.25 kg/cm 2\nwhen there is no inlet distortion, it is possible to ignite the secondary zone\nin 3 sec; but, when there is inlet distortion (even at\nP_ = 0.3 kg/cm2), the\nrange of flame stabilization is very narrow and the ignltablllty in the secondary zone is very weak.\n(It is impossible to ignite the fuel-alr mixture in\nthe secondary zone.)\nEffect of Secondary Air Entry Holes on Stabilization\nof the SJ410-4A Flameholder\nWhen 54 secondary holes (8 mm in diam) are opened, the range of flame\nstabi]izatlon\nis very narrow (fig. 9).\nWhen these holes are blocked, the\nstabilization\nrange is broader.\nThe secondary air entry holes also reduce the\ncapability of igniting the fuel-air mixture in the secondary zone.\nIt seems\nthat the secondary air dilutes the primary combustion products and reduces the\ntemperature.\nEffect\n\nof Gap Height\n\nFigure lO(a) and (b) show the effect of gap height\nh on flame stabilization for the SJ410-4B and SJ410-3A configurations.\nThe range of flame\nstabilization\ndecreases with the increase of the gap height\nh, and the Ignltability also decreases.\nFrom this test we found that, for a specified configuration, there is an optimum gap height.\nFor instance, when the width of\nthe V gutter is ?0 mm (SJ410-3A), the optimum gap height is 3 to 5 mm, the\nwidth of V-gutter is 40 mm (SJ410-4B), and the optimum gap height is 2 to 3 mm.\nUnder these conditions, the range of ignition and flame stabilization\nand the\nignition capability in the secondary zone are nearly the same for the two\nconfigurations.\nEffect of Bluff Body Shape\n\non Flame Stabilization\n\nFigure ll(a) shows the flame stabilization\nrange for the SJ410-3A configuratlon under ambient air temperature with a different bluff body shape.\nlhe range of flame stabilization\nof the V-gutter bluff body is wider than that\nof the semlspherIcal bluff body.\nBut as shown in figure ll(b), at T_ = 500 \xc2\xb0C\nthe ranges of flame stabilization\nfor both bluff bodies are nearly the same.\nIbis can be explained as follows.\nAt high inlet temperature, the vaporlzatlon\nrate of the fuel spray (before entering the primary zone) is h lgh for both\nflameholders;\ntherefore, the gaseous fuel-air ratios of the mixtures in the\nprimary zone are nearly the same.\nBut at low temperature, the fuel vaporl7_flnn\n\nr_f_\n\nnn\n\nfh_\n\nV_nllff:r\n\n\xc2\xa2llrf_ro\n\nic\n\nhinh_r\n\nfh_n\n\nfhmf\n\nnn\n\nfha\n\n:ami_(nharlr}l\n\nbody, and the fuel-alr ratio in the primary zone of the V-gutter\nthat of the seml-spherlcal body.\nlhus, the V-gutter has a wider\nstabilization.\nEffect\n\nof Air Entry Holes\n\nin V-Gutter\n\nWall\n\non Flame\n\nis higher than\nrange of flame\n\nStabilization\n\nFigure 12 shows the range of flame stabilization\nfor the SJ410-3B configuratlon with different air entry holes in the V-gutter wall.\nFor a given\n194\n\nopening area, fewer holes with larger diameters offer better flame stabilization than smaller holes. A comparison of figure lO(b) with figure 12 shows\nthat the reclrculatlon\nzone created by the gap provides better flame stabilization than that created by circular holes.\n-\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nThese tests led to the following conclusions.\n(1) The use of a piloted flameholder in the turbofan augmentor may\nminimize the peak pressure rise during ignition.\nAt the present experimental\nconditions, AP/P_\nis less than lO percent; therefore, the use of a piloted\nflameholder\nis a good method to realize soft ignition.\n(2) The geometry of the piloted flameholder and the amount of fuel\ninjected into the flameholder have a strong effect on the pressure oscillation\nduring ignition of the fuel-alr mixture in the secondary zone.\n(3) Compared with the V-gutter flameholder wlth holes in its wall, the\nV-gutter flameholder without holes not only has the advantages such as simple\nstructure and good rigidity but offers a wide combustion stability limit and a\nhlgh capability of igniting the fuel-alr mixture of the secondary zone.\n\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\nBranstetter,\nJ.R.; and Juhasz, A.J.:\nExperimental Performance and Combustion\nStability of a Full Scale Duct Burner for a Supersonic Turbofan Engine.\nNASA\nTN D-6163, 1971.\nCullom, R.R.; and 3ohnsen, R.L.:\nOperating Condition and Geometry Effects on\nLow-Frequency\nAfterburner Combustion Instability in a Turbofan at Altitude.\nNASA TP-1475, 1979.\nKurkov, A.P.:\nTurbofan\nNASA TM X-?IT41, 1975.\nMarshall,\nPresented\n\nCompressor\n\nDynamics\n\nDuring\n\nAfterburner\n\nR.L.; and Canuel, G.E.:\nAugmentation Systems\nat Crafleld International\nSymposium, 1976.\n\n195\n\nTransients.\n\nfor Turbofan\n\nEngines.\n\nAir supply\n7\n\nW\n\n" --\n\n2_.,x,,,_\n\nExhaus_\n\nC _\n\nI\n\n5\n\n6\n\n4\n\n3\n\nD\n\nFigure 1. - Test apparatus.\nValve,\n1; orifice\n2; air heater,\n3; contro]\nvalve,\n4; plenum\n5; test\nsection,\n6; ejector,\n7; valve,\n8.\n\nI\n\nSecondary\n\nzone\n\n2\n\nflowmeter,\nchamber,\n\n_\n\nAir\n\n"IL,o\n\n_a_\n\n___5__l_J_ _\n\n___\n\nFigure 2. - Test rig assembly.\nHigh energy ignitor,\nI; quartz\nwindow,\n2; thermocouple,\n3; pressure\nprobe,\n4; pressure\ntransducer,\n5; test\nconfiguration,\n6; fuel\nspray,\n7; fuel\nspray bar, 8; thermocouple,\n9; pressure\nprobe,\n10; pressure\ntap,\n11.\n196\n\n4\n\nI\n\ni\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\n{\n\nI\n\n*\n\nl\n\n\'\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n1\n\nl\n\n!\n\nI\nI\n\nJ\n\nI\no\n\ni\nq\n\n-i\n\nJ\n1\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\'\n\ni\n\n/\n\n\'\n\n!\n\n1\n\n_\n\n1\n\n(a) Configuration\n\nI\n\n/\n\n/\n\nI\n\n/\n\n,\'\n\n[\n\n/\n\n/\n\nr\n\n$3410-4A;\n\nI\n\n/\n\n/.\n\n/\n\n;\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nh = 4 mm.\n\n,\'\n\nt\n\nt\n\n_\n\n/\n\n,\'\n\n{\n\ni\n\nI\nf\n\nJ\n\nI\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nI\n\n/\n\n(b).

stainless-steel\ntubing\n(5.7 m long,\n6.4 cm on a side,\n1.3 cm thick\nwalls).\nThe entire\nlength\nof the tube was ground to a constant\nInside\ndimension\nand then honed to a\nhighly\npolished\nflnlsh.\nStattons\nfor shock-wave\ndetectors\nwere located\nat\n15-cm Intervals\nIn the downstream portlon\nof the tube.\nTwo 2.5-cm calctum\nfluoride\nwindows were located\n25 cm

wave with\nthe\nshock program of Gordon and McBrtde\n(ref.\n3).\nSince the reactton\ntemperature\nhad to be calculated,\ntt was very Important\nto measure the lnlttal\ntemperature\nand the shock velocity\nas accurately\nas possible.\nThe distances\nbetween probe\nlocations\nwere accurately\nmeasured\nto four stgnlftcant\nftgures.\nThe shock-tube\nwall\ntemperature\nwas measured to \xc2\xb10.5 C, and It was assumed that\nthe test\nmlxture\nraptdly\nachieved\nthis\ntemperature.\nThin-film\nresistance\ngauges (1.3 cm\n207\n\ndiam) were used to detect the passage of the incident shock wave.\nThe amplified output from these gauges was displayed on a digital oscilloscope (see\nfig. l).\nData points were recorded every 200 nsec.\nSince with this scope the\nscale can be magnified to allow viewing of each point, we were able to measure\nthe incident shock velocity to better than \xc2\xb10.2 _sec (O.1 percent).\nAll data were taken at an initial test gas pressure of B.O0 kPa (60 torr)\nand a driver pressure of 792.7 kPa (ll5 psla).\nSoft aluminum diaphragms separated the hlgh-pressure driver gas from the test gas.\nThese diaphragms were\npressurized and then pierced by a gas-actlvated\npiston.\nThe shock strength\nwas varied by adding small amounts of argon to the helium driver gas to change\nits molecular weight.\nFigure 2 shows the variation of shock velocity with the\nreciprocal of the molecular weight of the driver gas.\nThe constant pressure\nratio across the diaphragm insured that the opening process for the diaphragm\nwas about the same for all tests.\nGas mixtures were prepared by the method of partial pressures in 34.4liter stalnless-steel\ntanks.\nThe gases used to prepare the mixtures had stated\npurities of 99.99-percent methane, 99.98-percent\noxygen, and 99.998-percent\nargon.\nThe partial pressure of methane and oxygen could be determined to\nbetter than 0.3 mm of Hg, and the total pressure of the tank to better than\n1.38 kPa (0.2 psla).\nAll samples were prepared to a total pressure\nof 413.6 kPa (60 psla).\nRadiation at 3700 A was monitored for each experiment and was displayed\non the oscilloscope with the pressure history.\nThe radiation was detected by\na photomultlpller\ntube whose field of view was restricted by two slits (0.75\nand 1.5 mm wide) located lO and 23 cm from the center of the shock tube.\nWith\nthis arrangement we could view a 3-mm slice of the hot gas in the center of\nthe shock tube at the same location as the pressure transducer.\nAn interference filter centered at 3696.5 A (with a half band width of ll5 A) was used to\nisolate the 3700 A radiation.\nThe filter transmitted\n51 percent of the incident radiation.\nExamples of kinetic experiments\nin the next two

measurements\nof\nmixtures chosen to permit determination of the rates of reactions I, II, III,\nand V. Mixtures were selected by analyzing equation (1).\nGrowth constants were obtained by measuring the blue carbon monoxide\nflame-band emission behind incident shocks,\nlhe intensity of thls radiation\nis proportional\nto the product of carbon monoxide and oxygen atom concentrations (ref. 6), and, since very little carbon monoxide is consumed, the light\nmonitors the increase of oxygen atom concentration with time.\nA typical emission record is presented in figure 3.\nExponential\ngrowth\nconstants\nwere obtained\nfrom plots\nof the logarithm\nobserved\nlight\nintensity\nas a function\nof gas time (see fig.\n4); the relation\nbetween\ngas and laboratory\ntimes was obtained\nfrom the computer\ncalculations.\n\nSELECIION\n\nof\n\nOF GAS MIXIURES\n\nLet us turn now to the rationale used to select gas mixtures by analyzing\nequation (1). To begin with, under our experimental\nconditions\nv4 is\ngenerally small in comparison wlth other\nv; therefore, it can be neglected\nfor purposes of a qualitative discussion.\nSecondly, k turns out to be a small\npositive root - of the order of the smaller .v values and very small compared\nwlth the larger\nv\nvalues.\nThus, we neglect "_ _3\nin comparison with the\nother terms and rewrite equation (1) as\n\n[(v I\n\n* v 5)\n\n+ v 2 + v3]k 2 + v3(v I\n\n209\n\n_ _5)k\n\n_ 2VZV3(v I\n\n\xc3\xb7 v 5)\n\n(2)\n\nIf the amount of hydrogen In a mixture Is large In comparison to the amount of\noxygen, vI and v3 are large and the term involving\nX2 may be neglected;\nIn this event,\nX = 2v 2\n\n(3)\n\nOn the other hand, if only a trace of hydrogen\nterm involving\nk may be neglected, and\n\nIs present;\n\nv3\n\nIs small,\n\nthe\n\nX2 = 2v2v3(Vl \xc3\xb7 VS)\nv2 \xc3\xb7 (vI \xc3\xb7 95)\nIf we choose\n\na mixture\n\nwlth a large amount\n\n(4)\n\nof carbon monoxide,\n\nIs large and\n\n95\n\n(5)\nIf there\n\nIs a large amount\n\nof oxygen,\n\nN_/293(91\n\nis large and\n\n+ 95 )\n\n~ 2v_\nX N 2_9\n\n92\n\nfor\n5\n\n[H2]\n\nfor\n\n[CO]\n\n(6)\n\n> [C0]\n> IN2]\n\nThis, then, outlines a strategy for obtaining rates of reactions\nIII, and IV.\nFirst, a mixture rlch In hydrogen is used to determine\n\nI, II,\nk 2.\n\nNext, with\nk2 known, a mixture wlth a trace of hydrogen and rlch in carbon\nmonoxide Is used to determine\nk3. Finally, wlth\nk3 known, mixtures with\nexcess oxygen and varying proportions of hydrogen and carbon monoxide are used\nto isolate\nkI and\nk5.\nThe foregoing discussion indicates a qualitative procedure for selecting\ngas mixtures.\nHowever, we also need a quantitative measure of the sensitivity\nof the growth constant for a particular mixture to the various rate constants.\nFor example, we know that to isolate\nk3 we need a mixture with a trace of\nhydrogen, a small amount of oxygen, and an excess of carbon monoxide.\nBut, for\na candidate composition, Is the hydrogen concentration\nsmall enough, and Is\ncarbon monoxide sufficiently in excess?\nA quantitative measure of the sensitivity to the various rates can be obtained by logarithmic partial differentiation of equation (1). For example,\n\n!\nI\n2\n\nX2 + 2(91\n\n\xc3\xb7 293X + (91 * 95)(98\n\'-_4):\n\xc3\xb7 9394\nx2\n+ 92 + 93 \xc3\xb7 94 \xc3\xb7 95 ) \xc3\xb7 (9 ! \xc3\xb7 95)(93\n,\n\n94 )\n\n\xc3\xb7 9394\n\n(7\nEquation\n\n(7) shows that the growth\n\nI_-_ (a somewhat weaker\n\ndependence\n\nconstant\n\ndepends\n\non something\n\nthan that suggested\n\n210\n\nless than\n\nby equation\n\n(5)).\n\nlhe mixture compositions selected are shown in table I along with the\nsens_tivitles\ncalculated for a pressure of l atmosphere and the temperatures\nnear the m_dpolnts of the ranges of the experimental data. These mixtures\nwere chosen on the basis of (1) high sensitivity\nto the rate constant being\ndetermined, (2) minimized sensitivity\nto the other rate constants, (3) growth\nconstants in a convenient range for measurement(5xlO 3 to 7xlO4sec-l), and\n(4) sufficient\ncontent of minor, rate-limiting\nconstituents to permit accurate\nmixture preparation.\nIt was necessary to include in each mixture sufficient\nInfrared-actlve\ngas\nso that the arrival of the contact surface could be detected by the cessation\nof infrared emission. (The position of the contact surface between the driver\nand the driven gas was needed for the boundary layer analysis.)\nMixtures 2, 3,\nand 5 have substantial carbon monoxideconcentrations; carbon dioxide was added\nto mixture l to achieve adequate infrared activity.\nCarbon dioxide was also\nadded to mixtures 3 and 5 to ensure vibrational relaxation of the carbon monoxide. In preliminary experiments on a composition similar to mlxture 3 (both\nwithout C02) carbon monoxidewas not relaxed and rate constants gave an activation energy of 15 kcal for reaction 3; this is muchhigher than the values\nshown in reference ?. Results from mixture 3, with added CO show that the\n2,\npreliminary data were too low (particularly\nat the lower temperatures).\nCALCULAIION F RATE\nO\nCONSIANIS\nFROM\nEXPONENIIAL\nGROWTH\nCONSIAN_S\nRate constants were obtained from the experimental growth constants by\nmeansof equation (1), which was rearranged and solved for the rate constant\nbeing sought from the mixture in question: k2 from mixture 2, k3 from mixture\n3, etc. Mixture 2 was studied first, because the growth constants for this\nmixture depend almost exclusively on k2 and are only slightly affected by\nthe Fates of the other reactions (table I).\nValues of v4 were calculated\nfrom the k4 suggested by the Leeds Group (ref. 8). Trial values of kl, k3,\nand k5 were also taken from the Leeds recommendations(refs. ? to 9), but\nfinal values were taken from our owndeterminations.\nThis involves an Iterative procedure since our values of k3 depend, in turn, on our values of k2\nand, to a lesser extent, of k5. Two iterations sufficed to establish\nk2.\nNext, k3 was obtained by analyzing the growth constants for mixture 3,\nthen kI was obtained from mixture l, and finally\nk5 was obtained from\nmixture 5. Three iterations around the k3 kl-k 5 loop were required.\nA least-squares fit to the Arrhen_us equation was madefor each set of\nrate constants; these equations were then used in subsequent calculations.\nlhe experimental results are presented in the order in which the data\nwere obtained - first\nk2, then k3, kl, and k5. This is also the order of\ndecreasing precision.\nRate constants for reactions II and llI are plotted as functions of reciprocal temperature in figure 5. The least-squares lines through the data are\nk2 = 1.25xlO14 exp(-16.3 kcal/RT) cm mole-l sec-l\n3\nk3 = 2.96xi013 exp(-9.8 kcal/Rl) cm mole-l sec-l\n3\n\n211\n\nFigure 6\n\ncontains the data for reactions I and V plotted\nreciprocal temperature.\nThe least-squares\nlines through\nkI = 1.9xlO 13 exp(-4.8\nk5 = l.OxlO 12 exp(-3.7\n\nkcal/RT)\nkcal/Rl)\n\nas functions of the\nthe data are\n\ncm 3 mole -1 sec -I\ncm 3 mole -l sec -l\n\nIn this paper we showed how to make systemmatlc measurements\nso as to\nisolate the rates of individual blmolecular reaction steps in the complex of\nsix reactions which describe the ignition behavior of the hydrogen-carbon\nmonoxlde-oxygen\nsystem.\nWe have obtained what we believe are quite accurate measurements\nof the\nrates of the reactions H \xc3\xb7 02--,-OH + 0 and 0 + H2--_OH + H.\nProper accounting\nof the effects of boundary layer growth on the pressure, temperature, and\nresidence time behind the shock wave has been essential.\nOur measurements of\nthe rates of OH \xc3\xb7 H2--_H20 \xc3\xb7 H and OH * CO.-_CO 2 \xc3\xb7 H were less precise but\nwere perhaps the most direct determinations\nof these rates for temperatures\nabove llO0 K (previous hlgh-temperature\ndeterminations\nof these rates have been\nbased on flame sampling).\nFinally, we have estimated the rate of the Initiatlon reaction CO + 02--_C02 + O.\n\nMETHANE\n\nOXIDAIION BEHIND REFLECTED SHOCK WAVES,\nMEASURED BY PRESSURE AND FLAME-BAND\n\nIGNIIION\nEMISSION\n\nDELAY\n\nTIMES\n\nLarge computers have enabled us to assemble kinetic mechanisms for modeling the combustion of many fuels.\nThese mechanisms may have as many as 150\nreactions (variables) and in some cases the only experimental\nparameter matched\nhas been the ignition delay times obtained from shock tubes.\nMany studies\nhave been conducted on the ignition of methane-oxygen\ngas mixtures in shock\ntubes.\nHowever, in some cases the data are in error because of probe location,\nand in other cases the data are badly scattered because of poor measurements\nof the incident shock velocity or a very noisy pressure trace.\nThe delay time measured for a shock-heated hydrocarbon-oxygen\nmixture is\nknown to be a function of initiation reactions, of reactions of radicals and\nmolecular oxygen with the fuel, and of branching reactions.\nThese branching\nreactions increase the radical concentrations\nto a level where ignition will\noccur.\nDuring ignition, there is rapid depletion of the primary fuel, very\nhigh radical concentrations,\nand an exponential\nrise in temperature and pressure.\nUsually delay times are measured somewhere in this region by techniques\nwhich follow some physical process such as change in pressure or in the appearance of some emitting species.\nAlthough the time difference between the start\nand completion of the pressure rlse Is small, one would llke to determine the\ntime of the appearance of the signal as accurately as possible.\nThis time,\nwhich is the start of the ignition process, allows one to separate the fast\nignition mechanism from the kinetics of the primary fuel.\nThe next section presents ignition delay data for the oxidation of\nmethane.\nData were measured with a quiet pressure transducer for the temperature range of 1500 to 1920 K. The quiet pressure trace allowed us to determine\nthe initial rise in the ignition pressure.\nThe delay times determined from\nthis initial pressure rise were compared with the time of appearance of the\n\n212\n\nradiation\nat 3700 A.\nIn addition,\nthe methane and carbon dioxide\nconcentrations\nat the time of ignition\nwill\nbe measured.\nThese parameters,\nwhich\nmust\nbe dupllcated\nby any kinetic\nmodel,\nw111 be used to test\nthe correctness\nof\npublished\nkinetic\nmodels\nfor the combustion\nof methane.\n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nIgnition\n\nDelay\n\nTimes and Probe\n\nLocation\n\nFrenklach (ref. lO) measured ignition delay times at two locations in a\nshock tube and concluded that the location of the probe must be taken Into\nconsideration\nwhen selecting delay-tlme data to be modeled by a kinetic mechanism.\nSince optical access was necessary to monitor the infrared and ultraviolet radiation behind the reflected shock wave, It was important to know the\nerror involved In measuring the delay tlme 7 mm from the reflecting surface.\nTherefore, two pressure transducers were located 7 and 83 mm from the reflecting surface.\nThese allowed us to simultaneously measure the delay tlme for\ntwo locations In the same experiment (see flg. 7).\nAn ethane-oxygen-argon\nmixture (I.27, 5.05, and 93.68 percent, respectively) was used for thls series\nof tests.\nFor these experiments, delay time was defined as the tlme at which\nthe ignition pressure exceeded\nP5 by lO percent.\nThls eliminated the\nguess-work usually involved In determining the point at which the pressure\ndeparted from the flat portion of the trace.\nFigure 8 Is a plot of the delay\ntimes for the two locations as a function of I/T.\nA curve drawn through the\ndata taken at the 83-mm position appears to show a constant difference In the\ntlme between the two locations.\nA clearer understanding of thls phenomenon can be obtained from figure 9,\nwhich Is a tlme-dlstance\n(t-x) plot of the trajectory of the incident and\nreflected shock waves near the end of the shock tube.\nAs can be seen, the\ntlme at which shock heating occurs at a given location along the tube Is a\nfunction of the reflected shock velocity and the distance from the end wall.\nThus, ignition would be expected to occur at the end wall first, since the gas\nthere has been heated much longer.\nWhen ignition occurs, the pressure rlse\ncauses a disturbance which propagates down the tube.\nThe mlnlnum propagation\nvelocity of thls disturbance is the speed of sound In the shocked gas.\nVermeer\n(ref. ll) took schlleren photographs of ignition behind the reflected shock\nwave, and they clearly showed that the disturbance\nmuch greater than the reflected shock wave.\n\npropagated\n\nat a velocity\n\nThe data In flgure 8 were used to calculate the propagation velocity\nbetween the two probes.\nThls velocity had an average value of 1660 m/sec,\nwhich Is a Mach number of about 2.5. Thls velocity Is about four times that\nof the reflected shock wave.\nUsing thls velocity one can estimate that the\ndelay times measured at the 7-mm position would be too short by about lO _sec.\nThls error would not be important unless the measured delay tlmes were near\nlO0 _sec.\nNo corrections have been made In the present data, but times less\nthan lO0 usec are not considered reliable.\nAnother disturbing feature of the pressure traces Is the amplitude of the\nignition pressure.\nUnless something changes, one expects the ignition pressure\nto be the same at all locations In the tube.\nHowever, the ignition pressure\nfor probe 2 Is much larger than that at probe 1 (fig. 4).\nThe ratio of the\n\n213\n\nignition pressure to the reflected shock pressure P5 for the two probe\npositions is plotted as a function of the delay time at probe l in figure lO.\nNote that this ratio is nearly constant at probe l but increases with decreasing delay times for probe 2. This behavior suggests that the gas properties\nat ignition are not the sameat the two locations.\nIgnition\n\nDelay Times\n\nIgnition delay times were measured behind reflected shock waves for the\nmixtures shownin table II.\nThe pressure history and the carbon monoxide\nflame-band emission at 3700 A were used to determine the onset of ignition.\nThe delay times measuredby both pressure and flame-band emission are recorded\nin table III.\nThese delay times \xe2\x80\xa2 may be correlated by an empirical\nrelation of the form\n(S)\n\n= A exp(B/R1)[CH4]a[o2]b[Ar] c\n\nLifshltz (ref. 12) and Tsubol (ref. 13) both found an overall pressure dependence of -0.7 for a , b \xe2\x80\xa2 c.\nPlots of TP 0-7\nas a functlon of I/_\nfor each\nmixture are shown in figure 8.

Abstract\n\nA NASA - Chinese Aeronautical\nEstablishment (CAE) symposium on combustion fundamentals was held at the NASA Lewis Research Center from September 23 - 27, 1985.\nThis symposium was the result of an agreement (signed on 3anuary 31, 1979)\nbetween the United States of America and the People\'s Republic of China on\ncooperation in science and technology.\nA protocol agreement between NASA and CAE\nwas established\nin May 1983 to conduct exchanges and collaborative\nactivities on\nthe basis of equality, reciprocity, and mutual benefit.\nThe initial agreement\nwas to hold two symposia in the subject areas of structural analysis methods and\ntheoretical and experimental\nresearch in combustion fundamentals.\nThls publication Is a compilation of the technical papers presented at the second symposium.\nIt consists of five papers from senior specialists of CAE and seven papers from\nNASA senior specialists.\n\n17.
