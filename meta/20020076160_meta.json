The MPL System is built to characterize numerous details of the composition and dynamics of the atmosphere, such as atmospheric cloud and aerosol concentration and is suitable for environmental monitoring studies that require full-time, unattended measurements of cloud and aerosol height structure. It is eye safe at all ranges and because of the modest dimensions, can be used where space is limited. The system can also be equipped with a protective climate-controlled enclosure, permitting placement of the system in field operations where adequate shelter may not exist. Studies of climate dynamics, meteorological research, and environmental monitoring are a few of the possible applications.", "title": "Monitoring Earth's Atmosphere", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-07T12:51:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-27T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20020076160, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20020076160, "isbn": "0-16-049155-X", "id": "160e4815595f4cc5b0005ec5bbae2520", "publicationName": "Spinoff 1997", "publicationDate": "1997-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 19970041341, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "Spinoff 1997: 25 Years of Reporting Down-to-Earth Benefits", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20020076160.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20020076160/downloads/20020076160.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20020076160/downloads/20020076160.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20020076160/downloads/20020076160.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
