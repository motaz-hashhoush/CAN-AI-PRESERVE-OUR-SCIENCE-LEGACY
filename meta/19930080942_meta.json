The machine will make any size of constant-section wing or strut up to one-sixth inch chord by 36-inch span and up to a thickness of one and one-quarter inches. It cuts a smooth, true model that is accurate to within two-thousandths of an inch on any ordinate. The holding jaws are so designed as to leave the model free of chip marks, and the only hand finishing necessary after the cutting is a rub with amunite to remove burrs. The actual change on ordinate in this finishing rub is less than .0002 inches.", "title": "The Nichols Wing Cutting Equipment", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T18:17:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19930080942, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Ford, James B"}, "organization": {"name": "Massachusetts Institute of Technology"}}, "id": "d6f65e42d5704992a21e8465c68e4d53"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2014-06-02T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19930080942, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19930080942, "id": "660317fabdbb47ae8791f9776150af3f", "publicationDate": "1923-12-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19930080942.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19930080942/downloads/19930080942.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19930080942/downloads/19930080942.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19930080942/downloads/19930080942.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
