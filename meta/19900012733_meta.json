The factory joint disassembly inspections for this flight set were omitted. The decision was based on the rational that there is sufficient information in the present data base, and this would give H-7 refurbishment operations faster turn around time for this set of hardware. The factory joint disassembly inspections will resume for 360H005, Fifth Flight, through 360L007, Seventh Flight, due to a new grease application being in effect during the assembly process. The left hand nozzle was forced into the snubbed position upon splash down. This required unique tooling to be manufactured to perform the disassembly of the internal nozzle joints. This was completed on February 5 and 6, 1990 at the H-5 Clearfield, Utah facility. The RSRM consisting of capture feature, field joints with the J-joint insulation configuration is illustrated. The nozzle-to-case joint design, which includes 100, 7/8-inch radial bolts in conjunction with a wiper O-ring and modified insulation design is also illustrated, as is the ignition system seals and a cross section of the igniter. The configuration of all internal nozzle joints is shown.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19900012733, "id": "237838088d8b462dbe315711ff8f00eb", "publicationDate": "1990-03-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19900012733.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19900012733/downloads/19900012733.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19900012733/downloads/19900012733.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19900012733/downloads/19900012733.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
