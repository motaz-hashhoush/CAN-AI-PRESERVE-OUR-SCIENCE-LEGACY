A 15 A/mm spectrogram of the H-alpha region of R Sct two days past minimum brightness, when the visual magnitude was about 8.3, was obtained. This is apparently the first spectral observation of R Sct close to such a deep minimum. Contrary to spectroscopic observations during 'ordinary' minima of V about 6-7, at this deep minimum the expected G-K Ia absorption spectrum is not seen. Instead, a fantastic array of dozens of strong, narrow emission features and strong TiO absorption bands are present. The emission lines are due to neutral metals, and closely resemble a reversed photospheric spectrum. The deep minimum spectrum is apparently purely chromospheric, and is not produced in a stellar wind or extended atmosphere. The spectroscopic behavior of R Sct at deep minimum, as well as a number of other kinematic and photometric properties, is surprisingly similar to that of the R Coronae Borealis variables.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "publications": [{"volume": "95", "submissionId": 19840031750, "issn": "0004-6280", "id": "1a66069d2f08480391ba831176377439", "publicationName": "Astronomical Society of the Pacific, Publications", "publicationDate": "1983-10-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
