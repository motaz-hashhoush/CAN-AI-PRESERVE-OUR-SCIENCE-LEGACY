The model was applied to two data bases: (1) a NASA ground based simulation of an air-to-air tracking task in which nonvisual cueing devices were explored, and (2) a ground based and inflight study performed by the Calspan Corporation to explore the effects of simulator delay on attitude tracking performance. The model predicted the major performance trends obtained in both studies. A combined analytical and experimental procedure for exploring simulator fidelity issues is outlined.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19880016078, "id": "d8902e7ae0bd4149b89d5e3e48967ad6", "publicationDate": "1988-07-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19880016078.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19880016078/downloads/19880016078.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19880016078/downloads/19880016078.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19880016078/downloads/19880016078.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
