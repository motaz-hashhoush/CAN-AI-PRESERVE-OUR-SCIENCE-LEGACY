To date, nearly all reports have been anecdotal or subjective, in the form of post-flight interviews or questionnaires; objective and quantitative data are generally lacking. Although it is acknowledged that efficient face-to-face communications are essential for astronauts to work safely and effectively, specific ways in which the space environment interferes with non-linguistic communication cues are poorly documented. Because we have only a partial understanding of how non-linguistic communication cues may change with mission duration, it is critically important to obtain objective data, and to evaluate these cues under well-controlled experimental conditions.", "title": "Face to Face Communications in Space", "stiType": "PREPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-19T18:26:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20000119050, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Cohen, Malcolm M."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Ames Research Center", "location": "Moffett Field, CA United States"}}, "id": "d8ea12abaeda40e8b8f4214aab479931"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 20000119050, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Davon, Bonnie P."}, "organization": {}}, "id": "40f70c18eb2942e3b4a239e3ce463704"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Preprint (Draft being sent to journal)", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-22T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20000119050, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20000119050, "id": "698bac761a2a464f9f3273095b68630c", "publicationDate": "1999-12-10T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
