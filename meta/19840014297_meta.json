Existing analyses are used and extensions to them are developed to make more accurate predictions of rotor noise spectra and to determine which mechanisms are important in which circumstances. Calculations based on the various prediction methods in existing experiments were compared. The present analyses are adequate to predict the spectra from a wide variety of experiments on fans, full scale and model scale helicopter rotors, wind turbines, and propellers to within about 5 to 10 dB. Better knowledge of the inflow turbulence improves the accuracy of the predictions. Results indicate that inflow turbulence noise depends strongly on ambient conditions and dominates at low frequencies. Trailing edge noise and tip vortex noise are important at higher frequencies if inflow turbulence is weak. Boundary layer trailing edge noise, important, for large sized rotors, increases slowly with angle of attack but not as rapidly as tip vortex noise.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19840014297, "publisher": "NASA", "id": "805383f0c10a42ef9de8d1fe678b6e6b", "publicationDate": "1984-04-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19840014297.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19840014297/downloads/19840014297.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19840014297/downloads/19840014297.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19840014297/downloads/19840014297.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
