D. Middlebrook. The converter changes unsuitable dc voltage into one or more voltages suitable for powering electronic equipment; it can also be used in converting dc current to ac and vice versa. It was named one of the 100 most significant technical advances of 1979. The Cuk converter is more efficient than previous conversion devices, simpler, smaller, lighter, cheaper and highly reliable. The first application of the technology is in the Compucorp 685 word/data processor, manufactured by Compucorp. NASA waived title rights; Caltech granted exclusive license to the inventors, who in turn, transferred their rights to a company they founded called TESLA Company, which sublicenses the converter design and related technology to companies making power supplies for use in their own products.", "title": "Power Supply Unit", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-21T05:46:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-09-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20030002781, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20030002781, "id": "e65a1553386b4227a585952066788a5e", "publicationName": "Spinoff 1982", "publicationDate": "1982-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20030002781.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20030002781/downloads/20030002781.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20030002781/downloads/20030002781.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20030002781/downloads/20030002781.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
