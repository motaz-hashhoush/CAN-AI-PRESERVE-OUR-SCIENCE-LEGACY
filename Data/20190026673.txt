We vary the mass of the planets that reside at Jupiter\xe2\x80\x99s and Saturn\xe2\x80\x99s orbit and\nexamine the effects on the interior terrestrial system. We \xef\xac\x81nd that massive giant planets are more\nlikely to eject material from the outer edge of the terrestrial disc and produce terrestrial planets\nthat are on smaller, more circular orbits. We do not \xef\xac\x81nd a strong correlation between exterior\ngiant planet mass and the number of Earth analogues (analogous in mass and semimajor axis)\nproduced in the system. These results allow us to make predictions on the nature of terrestrial\nplanets orbiting distant Sun-like star systems that harbour giant planet companions on long\norbits \xe2\x80\x93 systems that will be a priority for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s upcoming Wide-Field Infrared Survey\nTelescope (WFIRST) mission.\nKey words: giant planets \xe2\x80\x93 simulations \xe2\x80\x93 terrestrial planet formation.\n\n1 I N T RO D U C T I O N\nTerrestrial planet formation is typically separated into three stages\ndue to the different physical processes that are involved in each\nperiod (Lissauer 1993; Righter & O\xe2\x80\x99Brien 2011a). The initial\nstage involves the condensation of solids from the gas disc that\ngrow until they reach kilometre-sized planetesimals (Chiang &\nYoudin 2010). The middle stage focuses on the agglomeration\nof small planetesimals (Moon-sized bodies) into embryos (Marssized bodies; Weidenschilling 1977; Ra\xef\xac\x81kov 2003). The \xef\xac\x81nal stage\nfollows the collisional evolution of embryos, the giant impact\nphase, that ultimately yields planets (Chambers 2001; Schlichting,\nWarren & Yin 2012).\nWhen modelling the late stage of planet formation, we assume\nthat all the gas in the disc has been dispersed. The lifetime of\na protoplanetary gas disc depends on the dispersal mechanisms\nof the gas, but for solar-type stars the lifetime of the gas disc\nis approximately 2\xe2\x80\x933 Myr (Alexander, Clarke & Pringle 2006;\nPfalzner, Steinhausen & Menten 2014). After the gas disc dissipates,\nthe growth of protoplanets ensues via gravitational collisions that\nyield accretion and erosion events (Wetherill 1995; Righter &\nO\xe2\x80\x99Brien 2011b).\nA shortcoming of the core-accretion model is its inability to\nreplicate the mass and formation time-scale differences between\nthe Earth and Mars (Raymond et al. 2009). A less conventional\n\nE-mail: childsa6@unlv.nevada.edu\n\npicture of terrestrial planet formation that addresses this inability is\nthe \xe2\x80\x98Pebble Accretion\xe2\x80\x99 model where 100- to 1000-km bodies accrete\nsubmetre-sized pebbles to form terrestrial planets (Lambrechts &\nJohansen 2012; Levison et al. 2015). Most studies that utilize Nbody integrators, however, model the late stage of planet formation.\nThe physics involved considers only the interactions of planetesimals and embryos as purely gravitational and, until recently,\nassumed only relatively trivial collisions \xe2\x80\x93 either completely elastic\nor completely inelastic. These commonly used collision models\nlimit the accuracy of simulations of terrestrial planet formation,\nas real collision outcomes are more complex (Chambers 2013;\nHaghighipour, Maindl & Schaefer 2017). An accurate collision\nmodel is needed to probe the properties of planetary systems that\ndepend on the collision history, such as their \xef\xac\x81nal architecture,\ncomposition, magnetic \xef\xac\x81eld, moon system, atmosphere, and internal\nstructure (Elser et al. 2011; Jacobson et al. 2017; Lock & Stewart\n2017).\nLeinhardt & Stewart (2012) developed a prescription for more\nrealistic collisions that includes fragmentation. Chambers (2013)\nimplemented this fragmentation model into the N-body integrator\nMercury to allow for collisions that result in partial accretion or\nerosion. With this fragmentation code, Quintana et al. (2016) studied\nhow giant impacts affect terrestrial planet formation in the presence\nof Jupiter and Saturn. They found that the \xef\xac\x81nal architecture of the\nterrestrial planetary system is comparable to systems formed using\na trivial collision model, but the collision history and accretion\ntime-scales of these systems differed signi\xef\xac\x81cantly \xe2\x80\x93 giving insight\ninto a different formation process.

This mission aims to resolve the\ndiscrepancy on giant planet occurrence rates.\nHere we explore the extent to which exterior giant planets\naffect the formation and evolution, and the \xef\xac\x81nal architecture of\nthe terrestrial planet system. We use a suite of high-resolution\nN-body simulations with \xef\xac\x81ve different giant planet environments\nwith giant planets at Jupiter\xe2\x80\x99s and Saturn\xe2\x80\x99s current orbit. Each suite\nof simulations has scaled down masses for Jupiter and Saturn \xe2\x80\x93\nmaintaining the 3:1 mass ratio between the body at Jupiter\xe2\x80\x99s orbit\nand the body at Saturn\xe2\x80\x99s orbit. We use exterior giant planets that\nare \xe2\x88\xbc 3 , 1 , 1 , and 1 the mass of Jupiter and Saturn. Because Suzuki\n4 2 4\n7\net al. (2016) argue that cold Neptunes are likely the most common\ntype of planets beyond the snow line, the smallest mass used in\nour giant planet systems is a Neptune-sized body. The integration\ntime and the varied masses used for Saturn and Jupiter are listed\nin Table 1. If we can constrain the role that exterior giant planets\nplay in terrestrial planet formation, we can predict how common\nSolar system-like planetary systems are in conjunction with the\noccurrence rates of planets on long orbits from WFIRST.\n\n2 S I M U L AT I O N S\nThe fragmentation code developed by Chambers (2013) (adopting\nthe collision model from Leinhardt & Stewart 2012) allows for\nseveral of collision outcomes. These include the following:\n(i) A collision with the central star if the object comes within 0.1\nau of the star\n(ii) Ejection of a body from the simulation if its semimajor axis\nbecomes larger than 100 au\n(iii) Completely inelastic collision (merger)\n(iv) A grazing event, which results in partial erosion or accretion\nafter less than half of the impactor interacts with the target\n(v) Head-on, or super-catastrophic collision, in which one of the\nbodies loses \xe2\x89\xa5 half of its mass\n(vi) A hit-and-run collision, in which the target mass does not\nchange, but the impactor may result in partial erosion (Genda,\nKokubo & Ida 2012).\nSince the CPU time-scales with the square of the number of\nbodies in the system, a minimum fragment mass must be set in order\nto reduce the computational expense as the number of fragments\ngrow. Our minimum fragment mass is set to m = 0.0047 M\xe2\x8a\x95 .\nErosive events occur when a body fragments and the excess mass is\nabove or equal to the minimum fragment mass. If the excess mass\nfrom an erosive event meets this requirement, the fragmentation\ncode will split the excess mass into fragments of equal size. If this\nmass requirement is not met, the collision will not result in any mass\nloss.\n\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/485/1/541/5309996 by NASA Goddard Space Flight Ctr user on 14 June 2019\n\ncollision history of a planet also has implications for habitability.\nTracking the fragments in a system allows us to examine how\nthe by-products of collisions interact with the rest of the system\nand affect planet formation. Further analysis of these interactions\nwill determine if they result in impacts that are catastrophic to the\nplanet\xe2\x80\x99s habitable properties \xe2\x80\x93 stripping the atmosphere, heating the\nplanet, fragmenting the planet, etc.\nWhen considering the Solar system, not only is a high-resolution\ncollision study needed to accurately explore the properties of the\nterrestrial planets, but the effects of the giant planets must be\naccounted for as well. Previous studies have shown the important\nrole Jupiter played in the formation of our terrestrial system.\nHorner & Jones (2008) showed that Jupiter shielded the earth\nfrom a high rate of giant impacts from the asteroid belt. More\ngenerally, Levison & Agnor (2003) found that different exterior\ngiant planet environments produce terrestrial planets of different\nsizes and orbits. Additionally, Raymond et al. (2014) found that\nchanging the eccentricity of Jupiter and Saturn will affect the orbital\nand mass distributions, and water delivery to the terrestrial planets.\nOther studies suggest that exterior giant planets may be necessary\nfor the development of life on Earth analogues (Horner & Jones\n2010b). Horner et al. (2009) found through numerical studies that\nexterior giant planets promote the delivery of volatiles to planets in\nthe habitable zone of the system. Additionally, Horner, Gilmore &\nWaltham (2015) argue that giant planets are needed to induce\nclimate change on planets in the habitable zone, similar to the role\nJupiter plays in the Milankovitch cycles on the Earth. Considering\nthe in\xef\xac\x82uence that the exterior giant planets had on the Solar system,\nthe question follows: what would our terrestrial planets be like if\nJupiter and Saturn did not grow large enough to accrete signi\xef\xac\x81cant\namounts of gas before the gas disc dissipated, and therefore had\nmuch smaller masses?\nAlong these same lines, thousands of diverse exoplanet systems\nhave been discovered by the Kepler mission. Although Kepler is not\nsensitive to planets on longer orbital periods, Foreman-Mackey et al.\n(2016) developed an automated method to predict the occurrence\nrates of giant planets with long orbital periods, even if only one or\ntwo transits were observed. Their probabilistic model estimates the\noccurrence rate for exoplanets on orbital periods from 2 to 25 yr,\nwith a radius between 0.1\xe2\x80\x931RJ to be \xe2\x88\xbc2.00 per G/K dwarf star.\nOn the other hand, Wittenmyer et al. (2016) found from radialvelocity surveys that \xe2\x88\xbc6 per cent of stars host giant planets (a\nplanet with a minimum mass of 0.3 MJup ) in orbits between 3\nand 7 au. Although there is some disagreement on the occurrence\nrates, future missions will help constrain these rates and it will\nbe useful to understand how giant planets affect terrestrial planet\nformation. Bryan et al. (2018) looked at systems containing superEarths and found that 39 \xc2\xb1 7 per cent of these systems host longperiod companions between 0.5\xe2\x80\x9320 MJup and 1\xe2\x80\x9320 au, suggesting\nthat there exists a correlation between the presence of super-Earths\nand giant planets on long orbits. Zhu & Wu (2018) found a stronger\ncorrelation between super-Earths and cold Jupiters, predicting that\n\xe2\x88\xbc90 per cent of systems with cold Jupiters contain super-Earths,\nand that cold Jupiters occur around 32 \xc2\xb1 8 of Sun-like stars.\nOur numerical results presented here show that giant planets affect\nterrestrial planet formation in a variety of ways.\nUpcoming missions are being designed to search for planetary\nsystems that resemble our Solar system with a higher sensitivity to\nplanets on long orbits. For example, NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Wide-Field Infrared\nSurvey Telescope (WFIRST) is expected to launch in the mid-2020s.\nSome of the mission objectives are to determine how common\nplanetary systems that resemble the Solar system are: what types\n\nGiant planet effects on terrestrial planets\n\nUsing this code, two extreme cases were studied by Barclay &\nQuintana (2016) \xe2\x80\x93 a system with Jupiter & Saturn, and a system with\nno exterior giant planets. Fig. 1 shows their results for the number\nof bodies in the system versus simulation time for 140 simulations\n(along with 16th and 84th percentile bounds). From this plot it is\nclear that the two tracks can be distinguished within the \xef\xac\x81rst 5 Myr.\nConsequently, most cases that we study here have a simulation time\nof 5 Myr. We integrate two of our simulation suites up to 500 Myr\n(one with Jupiter and Saturn and one with planets of mass 150 and\n50 M\xe2\x8a\x95 ) so that we may consider the evolution of the system over a\nlonger time-scale. We use a 7-d time-step in our integrations, which\n1\nis \xe2\x89\x88 10 the time of the innermost orbit period.\nPrevious N-body studies have used discs of small planetesimals\nand larger planetary embryos to successfully reproduce the broad\ncharacteristics of the Solar system\xe2\x80\x99s terrestrial planets (Chambers\n2001). As a result, similar mass distributions are commonly used\nin protoplanetary discs for N-body simulations studying terrestrial\nplanet formation around Sun-like stars. The disc used in our\nsimulations was adopted from Quintana & Lissauer (2014), which\nwas an extrapolation of the disc used by Chambers (2001). Our disc\ncontains 26 embryos (Mars-sized, r = 0.56 R\xe2\x8a\x95 ; m = 0.093 M\xe2\x8a\x95 ),\nand 260 planetesimals (Moon-sized, r = 0.26 R\xe2\x8a\x95 ; m = 0.0093\nM\xe2\x8a\x95 ) yielding a total disc mass of 4.85 M\xe2\x8a\x95 . The disc has no gas.\nThis bimodal mass distribution marks the epoch of planet formation\nthat is dominated by purely gravitational collisions (the late-stage)\n(Kokubo & Ida ). All masses have a uniform density of 3 g cm\xe2\x88\x923 .\nThe surface density distribution of the planetesimals and embryos\nfollows\n\xe2\x88\xbc r\xe2\x88\x923/2 , the estimated surface density distribution of\nSolar Nebula models (Weidenschilling 1977). These masses are\ndistributed between 0.35 and 4 au from a solar-mass star.\nThe eccentricities and inclinations for each body are drawn from\na uniform distribution with e < 0.01 and i < 1\xe2\x97\xa6 . The argument\nof periastron, mean anomaly, and longitude of ascending node are\nchosen at random. Exterior planets with different masses are placed\nat Saturn\xe2\x80\x99s and Jupiter\xe2\x80\x99s orbit, 5.2 and 9.6 au, respectively, with\ntheir present orbital elements. We ran a suite of simulations for each\nscenario \xe2\x80\x93 each comprising 150 simulations with a slight change of\none planetesimal\xe2\x80\x99s longitude of ascending node. Chaotic evolution\ntakes these small changes in one planetesimal and rapidly produces\n\nFigure 2.

Our main emphasis in this work is to\ndetermine the effects of a varying exterior planet mass on the mass\nthat remains in the regions where terrestrial planets eventually form.\n3 R E S U LT S\nWe \xef\xac\x81rst consider how the planetesimal and embryo interactions\nevolve in time as a function of the mass of the exterior giant planets.\nFig. 2 shows the total number of embryos and planetesimals in the\ndisc versus time for our \xef\xac\x81ve systems. A body \xe2\x80\x98leaves\xe2\x80\x99 the system\nwhen it is ejected, as previously de\xef\xac\x81ned, or when it has collided\nwith the central star. The data for all 150 simulations were gathered\ntogether into 105 -yr bins (this binning is used throughout the entirety\nof the paper).1 The median of each bin is the central line, and the\nbounds are the 16th and 84th percentiles.\nWe see that the larger the exterior planet mass, the faster the\nnumber of bodies decreases in the system. This \xef\xac\x81nding is in\nagreement with Barclay et al. (2017), who, using the same terrestrial\ndisc used here, simulated systems with Jupiter and Saturn analogues\nand systems with no giant planets. Barclay et al. (2017) found\nthat the systems with Saturn and Jupiter ejected one-third of the\nterrestrial disc within the \xef\xac\x81rst 25 Myr while the systems without\ngiant planets only ejected 1 per cent of the terrestrial disc by the end\nof 2 Gyr. Such a result is expected since a larger planet is capable\nof producing a larger perturbation to the orbit of the smaller bodies\nand more readily generates orbit crossings that lead to collisions,\nejections, or accretion on to the central star (Levison & Agnor 2003).\n1 While\n\nanalysing the output of the data, we found that Mercury with the\nfragmentation code began returning erroneous results after an integration\nwas resumed from a dump \xef\xac\x81le. After an integration was resumed from a\ndump \xef\xac\x81le, all of the bodies were reintroduced and parsed by the element\nmodule (which determines the orbital elements of the various objects). As a\nresult, there were data used by element for bodies that had been ejected, and\ntwo data points with the same time and different orbital element values for\nthe surviving bodies. After learning of this bug, the data were parsed and\ncleaned. If the bodies were ejected before the integration stopped, the data\nafter the time the body was \xef\xac\x81rst ejected were ignored. If the bodies survived\nand had two data points at the same time, the second data point was ignored.\nWhen reviewing the corrupt data, it was obvious that the second data point\nwas incorrect.\n\nMNRAS 485, 541\xe2\x80\x93549 (2019)\n\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article-abstract/485/1/541/5309996 by NASA Goddard Space Flight Ctr user on 14 June 2019\n\nFigure 1.

It also lists the ratio of time\nit took the system to reduce the number of bodies by 10 per cent\ncompared to the Jupiter and Saturn system, and the ratio of the\nexterior masses to the mass of Jupiter and Saturn.\nThe second most massive system in our study is the system with\n75 and 225 M\xe2\x8a\x95 cores at Saturn\xe2\x80\x99s and Jupiter\xe2\x80\x99s orbit, respectively.\nWhile the total exterior mass of this system is only 27 per cent\nsmaller than the Jupiter+Saturn system, it takes \xe2\x88\xbc2.5 times longer\nto eject 10 per cent of the system\xe2\x80\x99s bodies (1.2 Myr compared to\n0.5 Myr for Jupiter + Saturn). The least massive system, 45 and 15\nM\xe2\x8a\x95 , ejected only 7 per cent of the bodies in the disc before 5 Myr.\nThese \xef\xac\x81ndings show a strong relationship between exterior planet\nmass and the ejection rate of planetesimals and embryos.\nThe ejection rate sets an upper limit on disc mass and thus the\navailability of material for terrestrial planets to interact with and\nform from. Fig. 3 shows the normalized histograms of the remaining\ndisc mass (not including the mass from the exterior giant planets)\nin each run at 5 Myr for each of the systems, con\xef\xac\x81rming that lower\nmass giant planets retain more disc mass.\nConsidering the evolution of individual embryos gives insight\ninto the types of terrestrial planets that will form. Fig. 4 shows the\nmass distribution of the embryos that reside within 2 au after 5 Myr\nof simulation time for all 150 simulations (these are the bodies with\nan initial mass of m = 0.093 M\xe2\x8a\x95 ). For the low-mass giant systems we\n\xef\xac\x81nd embryo mass to be equal to or higher than the initial embryo\nmass. This result suggests that the embryos did not gain or lose\na signi\xef\xac\x81cant amount of mass and they are only accreting material.\nSlightly smaller embryos are found in the Jupiter and Saturn system.\nThis is most likely due to the higher ejection rate, which decreases\nthe amount of material in the disc needed for embryos to grow.\nThe median mass, semimajor axis, and multiplicity for the remaining embryos in each of the systems at this time are summarized\nin Table 3.

Fig. 6 shows the starting semimajor axis for all the embryos\nand planetesimals ejected within the \xef\xac\x81rst 5 Myr of simulation time.\nAs giant planet mass increases, it rapidly destabilizes the outer\npart of the terrestrial disc. This \xef\xac\x81nding explains the higher ejection\nrates, and smaller disc mass and semimajor axis distributions for the\nterrestrial protoplanets in the simulations with more massive giants.\nUsing the fragmentation code, we are able to follow the collision\nhistory of the embryos in higher resolution than done in previous\nnumerical studies. The collision history of a terrestrial system\ncan affect the composition/volatile budget (Horner et al. 2009),\natmosphere, internal structure, rotation, moon formation, or moonforming debris (Citron, Perets & Aharonson 2018; Kegerreis et al.\n2018). Fig. 7 shows the average occurrence rate for types of collision\noutcome in each system after 5 Myr of simulation time. These are\nthe collision rates for all embryos, planetesimals, and fragments\nacross all 150 runs for each system. Because massive giant planets\nare more likely to eject disc mass and produce collisions with\nthe central star, we see a higher rate of mergers and hit-and-run\ncollisions in smaller giant planet systems that have retained more\nmass. We \xef\xac\x81nd a similar distribution between head-on and grazing\ncollisions between all systems.\nA head-on collision will not necessarily result in a supercatastrophic collision. If the speci\xef\xac\x81c impact energy is too low, a\nsuper-catastrophic collision will not take place and fragments will\nnot be produced. Embryos that do not have an extensive history of\ncatastrophic collisions will be able to grow their planet size more\nreadily and maintain a thicker atmosphere, but their likelihood of\nforming a moon system or magnetic \xef\xac\x81eld decreases (Jacobson et al.\n2017). We have not seen any de\xef\xac\x81nitive moon systems in the Kepler\ndata, which are predominantly planets of several Earth masses and\nsizable atmospheres \xe2\x80\x93 though Kepler data may not be suf\xef\xac\x81ciently\nsensitive for most small moons. Teachey, Kipping & Schmitt (2018)\nhowever, found evidence from the Hubble Space Telescope that\nsuggests the Jupiter-sized planet Kepler-1625b may be associated\nwith a Neptune-sized moon.\n\nFigure 7.

As a more massive planet produces stronger perturbations to\nthe disc, the scattering will occur more quickly and reach a constant\ndisc mass sooner.\nAgain, we consider the orbital elements and mass of the embryos\nat 500 Myr so we may get an idea of the properties of the \xef\xac\x81nal\nterrestrial planet system. Fig. 9 shows the normalized histograms\nof the mass, semimajor axis, eccentricity, and inclination for the\nsurviving embryos at \xe2\x88\xbc500 Myr, and the remaining disc mass in\neach run. The median remaining disc mass at this time is \xe2\x88\xbc3.30 M\xe2\x8a\x95\nfor the Jupiter and Saturn system, and \xe2\x88\xbc3.62 M\xe2\x8a\x95 for the 150 and 50\nM\xe2\x8a\x95 , which suggests an anticorrelation between exterior giant planet\nmass and disc mass. Table 4 lists the median values and standard\ndeviations of the embryos orbital elements at 500 Myr. While both\nsystems have similar embryo mass and orbital distributions, the\nJupiter and Saturn systems tend to produce embryos that are lower\nin semimajor axis, mass, eccentricity, and inclination. However,\nthe largest fractional difference between the two systems is in\nthe inclination values, which is only \xe2\x89\x880.20 with the 150 and 50\nM\xe2\x8a\x95 system producing more inclined embryos. Again, the lower\nsemimajor axis, embryo mass, and embryo multiplicity in the Jupiter\nand Saturn system may be a result of a higher ejection rate of\nterrestrial material from the outer edge of the terrestrial disc.\nAnother feature that we see in these extended runs relates to the\nsecular dynamics of the system.

The system with 150 and 50 M\xe2\x8a\x95 planets at Jupiter\xe2\x80\x99s\nand Saturn\xe2\x80\x99s orbit is just as ef\xef\xac\x81cient at creating Earth analogues\nas the system with Jupiter and Saturn \xe2\x80\x93 with a total of 131 and\n126 Earth analogues, respectively, at 500 Myr. On average, both\ngiant planet systems produced one Earth analogue per run. The\ntotal number of Earth analogues produced in the Jupiter and Saturn\nand 150 and 50 M\xe2\x8a\x95 runs at 500 Myr are shown in red in Fig. 10.\nThe similar distributions of the Earth analogues between the two\nsystems suggests that a fairly wide range of giant planet masses can\nproduce Earth analogues.\nAs the Milankovitch cycles provide climatic variability on the\nEarth, a moderate eccentric orbit is needed to induce the climate\nchanges required by evolving life (Hays, Imbrie & Shackleton\n1976). Horner et al. (2015) found that changes to Jupiter\xe2\x80\x99s orbit\ncan have signi\xef\xac\x81cant effects on the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s eccentricity, and thus\nclimate. If the eccentricity of the Earth\xe2\x80\x99s orbit becomes too high,\nit can have catastrophic effects for life. Consequently, we examine\nthe eccentricity evolution of the embryo\xe2\x80\x99s that become the Earth\nanalogues at 500 Myr to predict if the resulting planets will\nhave a habitable eccentricity. The trend in embryo eccentricity\nis seen in Fig. 11, which shows the median eccentricity versus\ntime for all of the surviving embryos in the two systems that were\nintegrated for 500 Myr. Although the Jupiter and Saturn system\nyield planet eccentricities that are dampened more than the system\nwith the smaller giant planets, the two systems show a similar\n\nFigure 12.

We consider\n\xef\xac\x81ve different systems, each with scaled-down masses of Saturn and\nJupiter at Saturn\xe2\x80\x99s and Jupiter\xe2\x80\x99s orbit. We ran 150 simulations of\neach system with slight variations to the disc, for at least 5 Myr.\nWe use an updated fragmentation code to model collisions between\nbodies in higher resolution than previous N-body studies. Our results\nshow that exterior giant planet mass does affect some aspects of the\narchitecture of the terrestrial system \xe2\x80\x93 its formation time-scale and\nthe details of the terrestrial planet\xe2\x80\x99s collision history. Interestingly,\nwe do not \xef\xac\x81nd that changing the giant planet mass at Jupiter\xe2\x80\x99s and\nSaturn\xe2\x80\x99s orbit signi\xef\xac\x81cantly affects the number of Earth analogues\n(a planet found between 0.75 and 1.5 au with a mass > 0.5 M\xe2\x8a\x95 )\nproduced in our simulations.\nBecause the maximum integration time is only 500 Myr, we\nconsider the evolution of the embryos and make statements about\nthe expected properties of the resulting planets. The embryo\xe2\x80\x99s in\nthe systems containing lower mass giant planets are more likely\nto experience accretion events in the form of perfect mergers, and\nsystems containing higher mass exterior giant planets are more\nlikely to eject material from the outer edge of the terrestrial disc.\nWe compare the collision rates among all the systems used in our\nsimulations after 5 Myr. The largest statistical difference is found in\nthe ejections rates. Simulations with larger giant planets eject more\nmaterial. For example, the Jupiter and Saturn system ejects more\nthan six times the amount of matter than the system with the lowest\nmass giant planets (45 and 15 M\xe2\x8a\x95 ). Further analysis shows that\nthe larger the mass of the exterior giant planet, the more likely the\nejections originate from the outer edge of the terrestrial disc. This\ntruncation of the outer terrestrial disc leads to terrestrial planets on\nshorter orbits.\nAmong all of the systems, with the exception of the system with\nthe smallest giant planet masses, the grazing events are similar. The\ngrazing rates may affect the density of the \xef\xac\x81nal planets as grazing\nimpacts tend to remove the outer portion of the embryo. If the\nembryo is differentiated at this time, a grazing event will increase\nthe density of the body. The system with 45 and 15 M\xe2\x8a\x95 exterior giant\nplanets has the lowest rate of grazing impacts with less than half\nthe number of grazing events than the Jupiter and Saturn system.\nThis suggests that systems with smaller exterior giant planets may\nproduce terrestrial planets with a lower density. All systems have a\nsimilar rate for head-on collisions, but Jupiter and Saturn produce\nonly 2 the amount of mergers and 3 the amount of hit-and-run\n3\n4\ninteractions than the system with the smallest exterior planets. This\noccurs because Jupiter and Saturn have a higher ejection rate and\ntherefore less material in the terrestrial disc than the other systems.\nThe eccentricity of a planet has implications for the habitability\nof the planet. A mildly eccentric orbit on the Earth is needed to\nprovide the climatic variability needed for the evolution of life (the\nMilankovitch cycles)(Hays et al. 1976); however, a highly eccentric\norbit can have catastrophic consequences for life (Horner & Jones\n2010a). Our simulations show that the larger exterior giant planets\ninduce lower eccentricity orbits after \xe2\x88\xbc10 Myr for the Earth\nanalogues in the system. We also \xef\xac\x81nd that systems with more\nmassive giant planets produce fewer fragments late in the evolution\nof the system, but a larger median fragment mass to median Earth\nanalogue mass ratio.\nAgain, more massive giant planets yield terrestrial planet systems\nthat are closer to the central star, given our initial disc, and the\nsecular resonances they produce affect the \xef\xac\x81nal locations of the\n\nterrestrial planets. As the giant planets scatter the planet-forming\nmaterial, the locations of the secular resonances move inward \xe2\x80\x93\nshepherding material as they sweep by. Interior to both resonances,\nwe \xef\xac\x81nd larger embryos, with the largest ones near the resonances.\nAt the same time, the chaotic regions produced near these secular\nresonances prevent the formation of terrestrial planets that are too\nclose to the resonance locations.\nPlacing constraints on the time needed for terrestrial planets\nto form is essential for a complete understanding of a general\nplanet formation theory. Our results show that the relaxation timescale (the time in which the giant planets signi\xef\xac\x81cantly perturb the\nterrestrial material) is sensitive to exterior giant planet mass. There\nexists an inverse correlation between exterior giant planet mass\nand this relaxation time-scale, \xcf\x84 . This relationship results from the\nstronger perturbations caused by more massive planets. Because\nsmaller exterior giant planets interact with the disc for a longer\nperiod of time than the larger giant planets, we expect the later\nsystem to reach a dynamically stable con\xef\xac\x81guration earlier in time.\nFuture exoplanet missions, such as WFIRST, will be sensitive\nto planets on longer orbital periods compared to those found\nby NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Kepler mission, or those expected from the recently\nlaunched Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). With the\nlaunch of WFIRST, we hope to measure the occurrence rate for\ngiant planets on longer orbits, and how they correlate with interior\nterrestrial planet systems. Such a measurement will determine how\ncommon Solar system analogues are in the galaxy.\n\nGiant planet effects on terrestrial planets\n\nRaymond S. N., O\xe2\x80\x99Brien D.
