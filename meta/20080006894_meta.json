The sensor includes a high energy gap (i.e., .about. 1.0 electron volts) semiconductor wafer. Mechanical force is measured by employing a non-centrosymmetric material for the semiconductor. Distortion of the semiconductor by the force creates a contact potential difference (cpd) at the semiconductor surface, and this cpd is determined to give a measure of the force. When such a semiconductor is subjected to illumination with an energy less than the energy gap of the semiconductors, such illumination also creates a cpd at the surface. Detection of this cpd is employed to sense the illumination itself or, in a variation of the system, to detect a gas. When either a gas or light is to be detected and a crystal of a non-centrosymmetric material is employed, the presence of gas or light, in appropriate circumstances, results in a strain within the crystal which distorts the same and the distortion provides a mechanism for qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the gas or the light, as the case may be.", "title": "Semiconductor sensors", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-24T08:29:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20080006894, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Gatos, Harry C."}, "organization": {}}, "id": "5d91b6c9412d4403913ae0b0f9591121"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 20080006894, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Lagowski, Jacek"}, "organization": {}}, "id": "26d00ef7c5444381baed4df35b7c8653"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other - Patent", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-09-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20080006894, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20080006894, "id": "582d9c3277434dca86bb79ae6714d749", "publicationDate": "1977-03-15T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20080006894.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20080006894/downloads/20080006894.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20080006894/downloads/20080006894.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20080006894/downloads/20080006894.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
