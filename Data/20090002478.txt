b'Web-Based Mapping Puts the World at Your Fingertips\nOriginating Technology/NASA Contribution\n\ntool to the public that captures and expands the abilities\nof ELAS. Improvements in the quality of satellite data\nhave demanded corresponding development of processors,\nand DATASTAR leveraged the original ELAS design to\naddress today\xe2\x80\x99s local and regional database requirements.\n\nN\n\nASA\xe2\x80\x99s award-winning Earth Resources\nLaboratory Applications Software (ELAS)\npackage was developed at Stennis Space Center.\nSince 1978, ELAS has been used worldwide for processing satellite and airborne sensor imagery data of the\nEarth\xe2\x80\x99s surface into readable and usable information.\nIn addition to satellite applications such as data from\nEarth-observing SPOT (Satellites Pour l\xe2\x80\x99Observation de\nla Terre) satellites, ELAS was applied to aircraft data and\nmedical imagery. While the ensuing decades have seen\ngreat improvements in software and imaging technologies, the original developers of ELAS had the foresight to\nuse a modular design, allowing capabilities to be added\nand expanded as the remote-sensing industry grew.\n\xe2\x80\x9cELAS provided a dictionary of parameters used consistently in over 100 applications, which aided users greatly.\nIn addition, ELAS modules typically used a common set\nof basic commands; after a short introduction, the only\ndifficulties with using ELAS were discovering what the\nvarious modules could do,\xe2\x80\x9d reflected Dr. Ray Seyfarth,\none of the original developers of ELAS.\nELAS could be considered an \xe2\x80\x9cAll-Star\xe2\x80\x9d NASAderived technology, having made frequent appearances in\nSpinoff in myriad applications, including use by NASA\xe2\x80\x99s\nTechnology Application Center in studies of the urban\ngrowth in the Nile River Delta (Spinoff 1985); Delta\nData Systems in the construction of their proprietary\nATLAS geographic information system (Spinoff 1986)\nand Advanced Geographic Information System (Spinoff\n1993); Ducks Unlimited Inc., in the construction of\nits Habitat Inventory and Evaluation Program (Spinoff\n1987); Medical Image Management Systems in its\ndiagnostic aid and image storage and distribution MD\nImage System (Spinoff 1991); Martin Marietta and the\nMid-Atlantic Remote Sensing Center in the development\nof the Integrated Automated Emergency Management\nInformation System earthquake preparedness program\n122\t Environmental and Agricultural Resources \t\n\nProduct Outcome\n\nThis image was constructed for a wetland mitigation study\nutilizing aerial imagery and soils and elevation data.\n\n(Spinoff 1991); and DATASTAR Inc., in the DATASTAR\nImage Processing Exploitation (DIPEx) desktop and\nInternet image processing, analysis, and manipulation\nsoftware (Spinoff 2003), the development of which has\nnow been continued in DIPEx Version III.\n\nPartnership\nIn 1992, Stennis\xe2\x80\x99 Commercial Technology Program\nmade ELAS available under the Freedom of Information\nAct, which allows federally developed technologies that are\nnot patent protected to be transferred to U.S. companies.\nIn DIPEx Version III, DATASTAR Inc., of Picayune,\nMississippi, has once again used ELAS software to bring a\n\nDIPEx is now a mature, user-friendly application used\nto perform image processing, analysis, and to manipulate\nremotely sensed imagery data. DIPEx can separate and\nprovide data classifications, false color composites, soils,\ncorridor analysis, subsurface vegetation, data enrichment,\nmosaics, and geographical information systems (GIS).\nThe architecture of DIPEx allows a wide range of scalability, and the dynamic dimensionality of DIPEx internals\nassures that the software is current with leading-edge\ncomputer hardware.\nUsers request either a deliverable product from\nDATASTAR or access data sets via their own computers.\nWeb customers subscribe to a selection of data points,\nthen log on and manipulate the data on a secure server\nwhich DATASTAR provides to protect the personal data\nof subscribers. The system is structured to allow hundreds\nof users to access and extract layers of information simultaneously.\nThese layers are composed of the combination of a\ndata source and a rendering asset, and are stored under a\nmap view; any number of folders can be used to organize\nlayer information. Map view assets allow a user to specify\nand save information, including legend, scalebar, geography, output format, and the layers to be rendered. Map\nviews also provide an easy mechanism to share maps over\nthe Web among groups of users. By decoupling the data\nsource and the renderer, the storage and management of\nthe data source are completely separate from the rendering, so a user can use one data source in many layers with\ndifferent renderings.\nThe Web interface itself is a significant upgrade for\nDIPEx Version III. The original interface was composed of\nSpinoff 2008\n\nThe Florida peninsula citrus growing region, as imaged by\nLandsat.\n\nHTML pages on which the user posted form information.\nThis architecture was effective, but did not lend itself to\nreusability and was quickly approaching its limits. Version\nIII is completely implemented using SOAP Web Services.\nSpinoff 2008\t\n\nThe Web Services have also proved very useful for other\napplications, and DATASTAR currently has Microsoft\n.Net connection software and Perl applications exploiting\nfunctionality of the DIPEx server.\nA true World Wide Web application that runs using\nhypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) and starts without\na Web browser, Version III evolved with worldwide\ngeospatial dimensionality and numerous other improvements. Version III is difficult to distinguish from a\nWindows-based application, with all the familiar menu\nsystems, mouse interaction, and drag and drop interfaces.\nDATASTAR is enhancing the system\xe2\x80\x99s mapping capabilities and colorizing data to give it depth. Data provided\nby DIPEx is compatible with all GIS software packages,\nincluding ArcView, ENVI, and ERDAS IMAGINE.\nThe flexibility and adaptability of the DIPEx system\ncontinues a defining trait that has held since the original\nELAS was developed. Taking complicated sets of data\nand integrating them into a clear and useful product\nhas long been the purpose of this software, and Seyfarth\nenjoys how far the software he helped create has come,\naffirming, \xe2\x80\x9cI am happy to hear that ELAS is alive in the\nsoftware of DATASTAR. The work from 30 years ago is\nstill valuable; I suspect there is a hold-out somewhere who\nis still typing ELAS commands.\xe2\x80\x9d\nDr. Ramona Pelletier Travis, who worked with ELAS\nas a research scientist in the 1980s and is now the manager\nof the Innovative Partnerships Program at Stennis, concludes: \xe2\x80\x9cELAS was a fantastic tool then, and I\xe2\x80\x99m glad that\nits various progeny have seen so much success, including\nDIPEx. It has been a great example of good government\nresearch spinning off to benefit the private sector in a\nsignificant way over a long period of time.\xe2\x80\x9d v\nWindows\xc2\xae and Microsoft\xc2\xae are registered trademarks of Microsoft\nCorporation.\nPerl\xe2\x84\xa2 is a trademark of O\xe2\x80\x99Reilly Media Inc.\nArcView\xc2\xae is a registered trademark of Environmental Systems\nResearch Institute Inc.\n\nCombination of imagery, point, line, and polygon data.\n\nENVI\xc2\xae is a registered trademark of BSC LLC.\nERDAS IMAGINE\xc2\xae is a registered trademark of Leica Geosystems\nLLC.\n\nEnvironmental and Agricultural Resources \t 123\n\n'
