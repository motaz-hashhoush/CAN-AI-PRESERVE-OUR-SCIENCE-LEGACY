The Landsat imagery can be used to make cartographic maps at scales of 1:250,000 which meet the US National Map Accuracy Standards, providing a means of map updating to correct for river meanders or changing shorelines. The Landsat data can also be used in defining and measuring agricultural areas, identifying pest breeding areas, and monitoring irrigation practices and crop performance. Total volume estimates can be obtained in many cases for surface bodies of water, and subsurface water supplies can be detected from changes in vegetation in some instances.", "title": "Applications of space technology to developing nations", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-08T13:03:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19760047740, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Freden, S.
