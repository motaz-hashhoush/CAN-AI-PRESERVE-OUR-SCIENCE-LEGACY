These models are based upon observations of the Solar System and of young stars and their environments. They predict that rocky planets should form around most single stars, although it is possible that in some cases such planets are lost to orbital decay within the protoplanetary disk. The frequency of formation of gas giant planets is more difficult to predict theoretically. Terrestrial planets are believed to grow via pairwise accretion until the spacing of planetary orbits becomes large enough that the configuration is stable for the age of the system. Giant planets begin their growth like terrestrial planets, but they become massive enough that they are able to accumulate substantial amounts of gas before the protoplanetary disk dissipates.", "title": "Planet Formation", "stiType": "PREPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-20T18:58:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20020061266, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Lissauer, Jack J."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Ames Research Center", "location": "Moffett Field, CA United States"}}, "id": "d4fb01173dfc409d9ea6735a2429a857"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 20020061266, "meta": {"author": {"name": "DeVincenzi, Donald L."}, "organization": {}}, "id": "241deac97da5487ea74c751136918528"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Preprint (Draft being sent to journal)", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-22T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20020061266, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20020061266, "id": "17ed2204e5254930b722011ab133476b", "publicationDate": "1998-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
