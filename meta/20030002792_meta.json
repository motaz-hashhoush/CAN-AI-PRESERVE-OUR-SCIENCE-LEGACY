It was developed by Prof. Miles and his associates, working in cooperation with the University of California's Department of Forestry. The team combined its own design of an all-terrain vehicle with a suspension system based on the NASA load equalization technology. Result is an intermediate-sized unit which carries a power source and the powered tools to perform a variety of forest management tasks which cannot be done economically with current equipment. Power Pack II can traverse very rough terrain and climb a 60 degree slope; any one of the wheels can move easily over an obstacle larger than itself. Work is being done on a more advanced Power Pack III.", "title": "Forestry Vehicle", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-21T05:46:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-09-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20030002792, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20030002792, "id": "f92aee5c3270477a843882412051f792", "publicationName": "Spinoff 1982", "publicationDate": "1982-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20030002792.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20030002792/downloads/20030002792.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20030002792/downloads/20030002792.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20030002792/downloads/20030002792.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
