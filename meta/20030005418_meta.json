In prototype unit efficient water-powered turbine drives an 8 inch diameter grinding disk at 6,600 rpm. Exhaust water cools disk and workpiece quenching any sparks produced by cutting head. At maximum power, tool easily cuts through quarter inch steel plate. Adapter heads for chain saws, impact wrenches, heavy duty drills, and power hack saws can be fitted.", "title": "Water Powered Tools", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-21T05:59:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-09-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20030005418, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20030005418, "id": "2c821823a47240ccb145ad1978b2e4db", "publicationName": "Spinoff 1976", "publicationDate": "1976-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20030005418.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20030005418/downloads/20030005418.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20030005418/downloads/20030005418.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20030005418/downloads/20030005418.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
