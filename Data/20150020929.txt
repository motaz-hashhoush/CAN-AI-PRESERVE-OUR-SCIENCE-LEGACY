The GFP in this experiment was used to identify\ncells actively releasing viruses. The experiment focused on the effect of microgravity on the\nGFP expression of Akata B-cells infected with Epstein Barr Virus (EBV). Two flasks were\nprepared with 30 million cells each and two bioreactors were prepared with 50 million cells each.\nAll four cultures were incubated for 16 days and fed every four days. Cellometer readings were\ntaken on the feeding days to find cell size, viability, and GFP expression. In addition, the cells\nwere treated with Propodium monoazide (PMA) and run through real time PCR to determine\nviral load on the feeding days.\nOn the International Space Station air samples are taken to analyze the bacterial and\nfungal organisms in the air. The Sartorius Portable Airport is being investigated for potential use\non the ISS to analyze for viral content in the air. Multiple samples were taken around Johnson\nSpace Center building 37 and in Clear Lake Pediatric Clinic. The filter used was the gelatin\nmembrane filter and the DNA was extracted directly from the filter. The DNA was then run\nthrough real time PCR for Varicella Zoster Virus (VZV) and EBV as well as GAPDH to test for\nthe presence of DNA. The results so far have shown low DNA yield and no positive results for\nVZV or EBV. Further inquiry involves accurately replicating an atmosphere with high viral load\nfrom saliva as would be found on the ISS to run the air sampler in.\nAnother line of research is stress hormones that may be correlated to the reactivation of\nlatent viruses. The stress hormones from saliva samples are analyzed rather than blood samples.\nThe quantity found in saliva shows the quantity of the hormones actually attached to cells and\ncausing a reaction, whereas in the blood the quantity of hormones is the total amount released to\ncause a reaction. The particular hormones tested for were cortisol, alpha-amylase, and DHEA.\nThe DHEA was very high in the two control samples tested.\nRegularly, samples came into the lab from local clinics to be tested for various viruses.\nSaliva, blood, body scrapes, and tears were received from the clinics and then run for VZV,\nEBV, and Human Simplex Virus 1 (HSV-1) with the results then reported back to the clinician.\nBlood, saliva, and urine from astronauts were also tested for viruses and logged. In addition,\nseveral cell cultures were brought up and grown, including adherent Human Lung Fibroblast\n(HFL) cells infected with VZV, and Akata B-cells infected with EBV.\n\n'
