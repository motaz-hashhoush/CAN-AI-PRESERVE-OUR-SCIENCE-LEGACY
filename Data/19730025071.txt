Anderton\n\nAt TaurusL ittrow\n\n0\n\nPreface\n\nThe Apollo 17 mission marked the end\nof the flight phase of lunar exploration.\nBut in terms of analysis and understanding of the Moon, the Apollo 17 mission\nmarked a point that was very near the\nbeginning.\nFor the past three years, experiments\nplaced on earlier Apollo missions have\ntransmitted their measurements back to\nstations on Earth, sending dots and\ntraces that slowly have drawn a picture\nof the Moon.\nMore than 23 billion data points had\nbeen received before the arrival of the\nApollo 17 astronauts on the Moon;\n\nadditional tens of billions will be added\nfrom the long lifetime experiments left by\nthat mission.\nYears from now, those measurements\nwill still be adding to the knowledge of\nthe Moon, the phenomena that formed it,\nand the cataclysms that molded its early\nhistory.\nSo after the centuries of philosophizing, of observing from the Earth, of\nassuming and hypothesizing and postulating and guessing, the first hard facts\nhave become available with which to\ndescribe the evolution of another planet.\n\nThe crew of Apollo 17: Commander Eugene A.\nCernan, seated on the lunar rover; command\nmodule pilot Ronald E. Evans, standing at\nright; lunar module pilot Harrison H.\nSchmitt, standing at left.\n\n,z.\nz k\n\n1 1\t\n\nI\n\n\'.:\n\n)4\t\n\nAsk i!\n\n-.\t\n\n-\n\n4\n\xe2\x80\x94Vol\n\nLL\nki\n\nel\n\nI\n\nIntroduction\n\nNothing can prepare you for the sights\nand sounds of an Apollo launching.\nTelevision, film, magnetic tapes and\nrecords are inadequate to convey the\nawe and the power of the experience.\nThe towering launch vehicle looms\nhundreds of feet above its pad into the\nhumid Florida sky. On top, almost 122\nmeters (400 feet) above the nearest\nstretch of sandy ground, is a tiny truncated cone, mounting a single launch\nemergency escape rocket attached by a\ntower structure. Inside the truncated form\nare three men in space suits, their\nprovisions, and the instruments and\nequipment that will take them to the\nMoon, protect them on its surface, and\nbring them home again safely.\nThousands of items, tucked away in\ncorners, built into complex installations,\nstowed in bags, worn, sat upon, and\nsecured to the spacecraft structure cram\nthe Apollo command module. In spite of\nall of this equipment, the crew\'s quarters\nprovide six cubic meters (212 cubic feet)\n\xe2\x80\x94two cubic meters (71 cubic feet) per\nman\xe2\x80\x94of habitable volume. That\'s about\none phone booth apiece, a mini-environment for work and eating and sleep\nduring the trips out and back.\nBelow the command module is the\ncylindrical service module, the name for\na catchall structure that holds fuel and a\npropulsion system in addition to scientific\ninstrumentation, oxygen and hydrogen\ntanks, space radiators, helium tanks,\nbatteries, and the other components that\nwill service and support the crew and\ntheir mission until the last leg of the\nvoyage homeward.\nAnd below that sits the lunar module,\nclosed in now by panels that conceal its\nangularity and its spindly legs. The two\nstages of the lunar module will make the\ndescent onto the lunar surface and serve\nas housing for the two astronauts\nbetween their excursions on the Moon. It\nwill carry with them to the Moon a lunar\nroving vehicle, a four-wheeled automobile\nthat will be used by the two astronauts to\nmove rapidly over long traverses on the\nMoon.\nThe lunar module stands seven meters\n(23 feet) tall; halfway up is the front\nporch, where the first astronaut to\nemerge after lunar touchdown will pause\nbefore backing down the ladder and\nstepping off the footpad onto the Moon.\nThe lunar module has two stages.\nJoined, they make the descent to the\n\nMoon. For ascent, after the lunar exploration has been completed, the upper stage\nseparates and serves as a single spacecraft for ascent, rendezvous and docking\nwith the command module in lunar orbit.\nThe weight of the lunar module alone\nis more than 16,000 kilograms (35,000\nIbs), a phenomenal number to those\nfamiliar with the early days of spaceflight,\nwhen payloads were measured by a\nfew kilograms, and as few as one. A\nlarge, loaded moving van weighs on the\norder of 16,000 kilograms (35,000 Ibs),\nfor comparison. Or think of it in terms of\neight compact cars. It\'s a lot of weight to\ntransport to the Moon.\nSo there they stand, stretching almost\n25 meters (82 feet) from the base of the\nlunar module housing to the tip of the\nrocket motors on the escape system\ntower. And below them, for another 84\nmeters (275 feet), are stacked the three\ncylindrical stages of the launch vehicle.\nStart nearest the spacecraft, with the\nthird stage, the Saturn S-IVB, almost\nseven meters (23 feet) in diameter and\njust over 18 meters (59 feet) high. It is\nloaded with liquid hydrogen and liquid\noxygen propellants for its single J-2 engine\nwhich will deliver 926,367 newtons of\nthrust in the final phase of the powered\nflight.\nThe third stage and the spacecraft will\nbe brought up to speed by the second\nstage, the Saturn S-Il, a 10-by 25-meter\n(32.8- by 82-foot) cylinder with five J-2\nliquid rocket engines delivering more\nthan 5 million newtons of thrust.\nThat performance seems almost insignificant when compared to the first stage,\nthe mighty Saturn S-IC, again 10 meters\n(32.8 feet) in diameter, but peaking at\nmore than 42 meters (138 feet) high. At\nits base are five F-i rocket engines, four\nin a cruciform around a central unit, and\neach good for almost 7 million newtons\nof thrust at takeoff.\nReady to go, the whole assembly of\nspacecraft and launch vehicle towers\n119 meters (363 feet) above the launching\npad, and weighs almost 3 million kilograms\n(7 million lbs).\n\nAstronaut Ron Evans gets a last hug before\nentering the van to ride to the launch site.\n\nNight Launch\n\nIt is the warm, muggy evening of\nDecember 6 on a sandy cape area east\nof Orlando, Florida, where the Banana\nRiver winds through marshes, where\nherons, pelicans, and alligators search the\nwaters. Stretching toward the sky at\nPad A, Launch Complex 39, the huge\nrocket is lit by banks of searchlights,\ndelineating its whiteness against the\ndarkening skies. The countdown is\nroutine, smooth.\nAt 3 hours and 30 minutes before\nscheduled launch, there is a hold time\nbuilt into the schedule. The clocks stop\nfor one hour. Less than half an hour\nlater, the doors of the Manned Spacecraft\nOperations Building open, and the Apollo\n17 crew walk toward their transfer van,\nheaded for their flight to the Moon.\nEugene A. Cernan and Ronald E. Evans\nand Harrison H. Schmitt: white and bulky\nin their flight suits, carrying their portable\nbreathing and cooling systems, their\nfaces shielded by the clear visors of their\nnear-spherical helmets. Flashguns fire\nbrilliant lights against their bodies; Evans\nhesitates, raises his right arm, bumps\nhis body toward the cameras.\nFrom the observation site, this has\nbeen seen on television monitors that dot\nthe area. In the grandstand, there are\nthousands of reporters, writers, researchers. Ahead of the grandstand, between\nit and the small body of water in whose\nblack surface the Apollo rocket is reflected, stand dozens of cameramen. And\noff at remote sites there are other\ncameras and cameramen, television and\nmovie, still and recording cameras, to\nmake this last flight perhaps the most\nthoroughly documented of all.\nThe countdown goes on, flawlessly.\nAcross the way perhaps a quarter of a\nmile, a parade of official vehicles, blue\nand red dome lights flashing, makes its\nslow way out toward the launch site.\nCernan, Evans and Schmitt are on the\nway to the Moon by van and auto, rolling\non rubber tires at a few miles per hour,\ngingerly, easily, toward the waiting\nspacecraft. Two hours and 40 minutes\nbefore the scheduled departure, they\nclamber aboard the command module.\nThey "ingress" the module, in NASA\'s\nawkward but precise terminology.\nAnd then the checks of systems begin,\nright down to the final range safety\nchecks. Two helicopters, one with a\nhigh-powered searchlight, patrol the\nbeach area.\n\nThe searchlights at Launch Complex\n39 bathe the scene in near-daylight,\ncatching the wisps of venting oxygen as\nthey drift slowly westward from the\nlaunch pad. The clock goes through T\n-5 minutes, and the count proceeds.\nNow at T -3 minutes, 6 seconds, the\nautomatic sequencer starts to control\nthe countdown. It performs each task,\nverifies that it is done, removes an interlock that prevents the next task from\nbeing done prematurely, or from being\nomitted, and does the next task. It does\neach, right down to 30 seconds, and the\nclock stops. Apollo control comes on the\nair to announce a hold, as it will do over\nthe next two and one-half hours while the\nproblem\xe2\x80\x94a signal that the third-stage\nliquid oxygen tanks had not been pressurized\xe2\x80\x94is solved by working out a\nsafe alternate around that signal.\nThat alternate was developed on a\n"breadboard"\xe2\x80\x94a working duplicate of\nthe complex control systems\xe2\x80\x94by engineers at the Marshall Space Flight Center\nin Huntsville, Alabama. Their solution\nwas a workaround which they checked\nand rechecked to verify its reliability. It\nworked, and passed the checks, and the\ncommunications links between the two\nNASA Centers carried the details of the\nalternate procedure to the control room\nat the Kennedy Space Center.\nFinally, after a second prolonged hold\nat T-8 minutes, the final countdown\nbegins, continues through the 30 second\nmark to cheers from the watchers, and\napproaches the T-10 second mark.\nApollo Saturn Launch Control: "Ten\nnine. . . eight. . . seven ... ignition\nsequence started . . . all engines are\nstarted . . . we have ignition......\nThere is a short, intense burst of white\nflame at the bottom of the Saturn first\nstage; it blossoms to a huge burning\nwhiteness, bright as the Sun, spreading\noutward through billowing clouds of\nsteam and is surrounded, but not\nswallowed, in bright orange sheets of\nfire from the five rocket engines.\n"Two. . . one. . . zero. .. we have a\nliftoff. We have a liftoff and it\'s lighting\nup the area, it\'s just like daylight here at\nKennedy Space Center as the Saturn V\nis moving off the pad. It has now cleared\nthe tower."\nThe enormous bulk of launch vehicle\nand spacecraft moved slowly, ponderously upward through the steam and\nflame. The only noise was the com-\n\nmentary from launch control and the\ncheering of the crowd in the grandstand.\nThe rocket began to climb into the\nnight, above the searchlights now but\nneeding no other light than the fire in its\nengines and the incandescent foxtail of\nflame streaming behind it.\nAnd then, perhaps fifteen seconds\nlater, the noise hit, a blasting, snapping,\ncrackling roar unlike any noise before.\nThe physical impact stopped the breathing momentarily, and then the metal roof\nof the grandstand began to rattle and\nshake under the hammering of the shock\nwaves from the engine. They sounded\nlike a rapid-fire series of cannon shots\nfrom a few yards away, sharp explosive\nbangs that were startling, unsteady,\nhigh-pitched and roaring at the same\ntime.\nAnd through all the blasting the\nlaunch vehicle slowly climbed through\nthe blackness, its five-forked flame\nstreaming orange light, illuminating the\nupturned faces of the shouting crowd. It\nbegan to turn into its slow curving path\ndownrange, and the flames began to\nopen up behind the rocket like a pale\norange umbrella of fire as the atmosphere\nthinned and reduced the external pressure on the engines. The individual\nrocket engines burned like bright dots of\norange behind the veil of paler orange\nas the Saturn booster continued to turn\ndownrange and the fiery umbrella kept\nopening outward, seeming to fill the sky\nand cover the Cape.\nThen the center engine was shut down\nautomatically and a few seconds later,\nthe outboard engines blinked out together. There was a brief pause, and\nthen the white fireball of the second-stage\nengines igniting lit up the sky like a\nlightning stroke, and stabilized into a\nburning sphere of white light streaking\ntoward the Moon like a rising star.\n\nFoxtail flame from five rocket engines in the\nSaturn lights the sky and the ground around the\nlaunch complex.

The\nSculptured Hills are the bumpy terrain at the\nbottom. The command/service module is seen\nin the distance.\n\nAbout 12 minutes after liftoff, the\non-board computers read out the\nmaximum and minimum altitudes of the\nEarth orbit that had just been established. But this was simply a parking\norbit for a short time, a time to catch the\nbreath, figuratively speaking, and to get\nready for the rocket engine firing that\n\n--\n\n,-.-\t\n\n-\n\nwould launch the command and service\nmodules across the long blackness\ntoward the tiny Moon.\nAbout 3 hours later, the Saturn\nS-IVB stage began its second burn,\nthrusting the spacecraft out of its parking\norbit and heading it into space. For\nalmost six minutes the rocket engine\n\nSeparation and Descent\n\nfired, adding about 3,000 meters per\nsecond (10,000 feet per second) to the\nvelocity of the speeding spacecraft. Now\nat 10,440 meters per second (34,250 feet\nper second), the spacecraft engine\nstopped and the astronauts were on\ncourse and on speed for the Moon.\nThat, too, was a routine trip. But the\nsights were new to two of the astronauts\n\xe2\x80\x94Evans and Schmitt, who had not been\nin space before\xe2\x80\x94and they could not\ntear themselves away from the windows\nduring the parking orbit, or the flight\noutward. After one pass around the\nworld, one radioed back:". . . we had\nalmost a completely weather-free pass\nover Africa and Madagascar. And the\nscenery both esthetically and geologically was something like I\'ve never seen\nbefore . . . there were patterns like I\nhaven\'t seen in textbooks......\nSchmitt, the geologist, became interested in the weather patterns that he\ncould see developing and changing on\nthe Earth.\n"It looks like Mexico in general is\npretty nice, although there is a band of\neast-west trending clouds that start from\nthe Gulf of California across Sonora,\nand probably up through New Mexico\nand over into Texas as far around as I\ncan see. Southern California looks like\nit\'s in pretty good shape today, but\nnorthern California looks like it\'s probably overcast. And a major system\nprobably associated with that stretches\ninto the north western United States. But\na band of clear weather . . . stretches\nfrom Arizona right on up through\xe2\x80\x94[\nwould guess\xe2\x80\x94through Colorado, Kansas\nand probably into the midwest pretty\nwell."\nAnd Capcom answered, ". . . you\'re a\nregular human weather satellite."\nLater, Schmitt called in with this\nobservation: "Bob, you always wish that\nyou had a poet aboard one of these\nmissions, so he could describe things\nthat we\'re seeing and looking at and\nfeeling in terms that might transmit at\nleast a part of that feeling to everybody\nin the world. Unfortunately that\'s not the\ncase, but.. . I certainly hope that some\nday, in the not too-distant future, the guy\ncan fly who can express these things."\nThe long hours passed, and then the\nMoon, which had been looming larger\nand larger, became the primary target of\ntheir thoughts and views.\n\nIt was the smoothest landing, closest\nto the planned touchdown point, of any\nof the Apollo missions. \'Challenger,"\nthe lunar module, had undocked and\nseparated from "America," the command/\nservice module, earlier, and its astronauts had completed the second\ndescent orbit insertion maneuver without\nincident.\nAnd now it was time to start the final\ndescent toward the lunar surface.\nAstronauts Cernan and Schmitt, in\nconstant contact with Mission Control at\nHouston, completed check after check\npreliminary to the actual firing of the\ndescent engine that would lower them to\nthe Moon. The checks completed and the\ngo-ahead given, the final details of the\npre-ignition sequence came over the\nvoice link from Challenger:\n"Ten seconds. . . fuel ullage; we\'ve\ngot ullage . . . two . . . one. . . ignition,\nignition Houston . . . attitude looks\ngood......\nThe descent engine had fired, applying\nits thrust to brake the coasting speed of\nChallenger and move it out of the lunar\ntransfer orbit toward the vertical descent\nand touchdown.\n"Challenger, you\'re go for enter," said\nMission Control, and the final procedures\nbegan on board the lunar module. They\nwere closing in on the landing site, and\nrecognizing its features: "Okay, I\'ve got\nthe South Massif ..... ye got Nansen,\nI\'ve got Lara and I\'ve got the scarp .\noh, are we coming in . . . oh, baby!"\nNow just a hundred feet above the\nsurface, the commentary came fast as\nChallenger eased toward touchdown.\n"Eighty feet. . . going down at three\ngetting a little dust . . . very little\ndust.. . stand by for touchdown\ndown two . . . feels good . . . twenty\nfeet . . . ten feet . . . contact!" Then the\nengine shutdowns, the switch closings,\nand the two astronauts had arrived at\nthe surface.\n"Okay, Houston, the Challenger has\nlanded . . . tell America that Challenger\nis at Taurus-Littrow."\nThere was a brief time while the crew\ncompleted more checks and waited for\npermission from Mission Control to go on\nwith the planned phases of the mission\nthat would take them to the opening of\nthe hatch and the exit onto the Moon.\n"I\'ll check everything again. Let\'s just\ndouble-check. Okay. That hasn\'t changed\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 it looks good . . . the manifold hasn\'t\nchanged . . . the RCS hasn\'t changed\n\xe2\x80\xa2 ascent water hasn\'t changed ... the\nbatteries haven\'t changed.\n"Oh, my golly, only we have changed!"\nThey had, just as other astronaut\ncrews before them had changed. Somehow, the emotions of the moment, the\nenormity of the task just completed, the\nawe of being on the Moon, the stark\nbeauty of its features, reach through\nthe outer shell of objectivity and\nmachinery that shields the astronauts.\n"Only we have changed!" He said it\nfor all of them, and for all of mankind.\nMan is on the Moon, and we\'ve changed.\n\nChallenger, the lunar module, has just\nseparated from America, the command module,\nprior to the LM\'s descent to the lunar surface.\n\nSculptured Hills\n\nAPOLLO 17 EVA Map\n0\t\n\nI\t\n\n500 1000\nI Meters\nI\t\n\nCoc\nVan Serg\r\nShakespeare\r\nSherlock\n\n7\nEVA3\nHenry\n\n6\n\n_______Steno\r\nSan Luis Rey\r\nEmory\n\nMariner\n\nLocke\nJones\nRudolph\nNorth Massif\n\nTrident\nLM\n\nGoodwill Rock\n_______ Hess\n\nALSEP\n\nCamelot\nMackin\nN\n\nHoratio\n\nSpirit\nDruid\nVictory\n\nBronte\nEVA2\n\nla Flat\n\nOrange Soil\nShorty\n\nNemo\n\n- Lee Scarp\r\nExplanation\t\n\nle-in-the-Wall\r\n\nStonewall\n\nLM Lunar Module\t\n\nLara\n\n-\n\nEVA Extravehicular Activity\nALSEP Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Package\nSEP Surface Electrical Properties Experiment transmitter station\n\n-a A\nSouth Massif\n2\n\nNansen\n\nEVA,, The Sixth Lunar Surface\nExpedition\n\n"The next thing it says is that Gene\ngets out." Astronaut Jack Schmitt,\nreading the checklist before their first\nmoves outside the protective environment\nof the lunar module, had come to that\nline.\nThis was the beginning of the first\nextra-vehicular activity (EVA), the\nNASA jargon for moving and working on\nthe lunar surface. Cernan, on hands and\nknees now and backing out of the tiny\ntunnel opening in the lunar module,\nedges along carefully, wary of getting\nstuck or hung up.\nCernan: How are my legs? Am I\ngetting out?\nSchmitt: Well, I don\'t know. I can\'t see\nyour legs . . . I think you\'re getting out\nthough, because there isn\'t as much of\nyou in here as there used to be.\nCernan: Okay.. . my legs are out\nHouston, Commander is on the porch of\nChallenger."\nAnd now Cernan is backing down the\nladder. "I\'m on the footpad. And,\nHouston, as I step off at the surface at\nTaurus-Littrow, I\'d like to dedicate the\nfirst step of Apollo 17 to all those who\nmade it possible."\nThen it was Schmitt\'s turn to descend\nthe ladder and to step onto the lunar\nsurface. After a quick walkaround\ninspection, and a first look at the surface\naround the landing site, Cernan and\nSchmitt freed the lunar rover from its\nberth, tucked into the lunar module. It\ncame out, unfolding as it came, and\nstood ready for work. Sixteen minutes\nlater, after a bit of difficulty getting the\nvehicle locked together, Cernan climbed\naboard for a test drive.\n"Can\'t see the rear ones, but I know\nthe front ones turn, and it does move.\nHouston, Challenger\'s baby is on the\nroad."\nThe test drive over, Cernan and\nSchmitt began to explore the area,\nSchmitt picking up rocks and commenting on their apparent structure. They\nfumbled, stumbled and fell, getting used\nto the strange feelings of moving in\none-sixth the gravity force of the Earth.\nCernan warned Schmitt: "You\'ve just got\nto take it easy until you learn to work in\none-sixth g," and Schmitt answered,\n"Well, I haven\'t learned to pick up rocks\nwhich is a very embarrassing thing for a\ngeologist."\nAnd then, just before they attached\nthe television camera, Cernan called\n\nAstronaut Schmitt, the lunar module (left) and\nthe lunar rover (right) pose with the American\nflag at the Taurus-Littrow base\nover to Schmitt, who was working hard\nat loading the rover: "Hey, Jack, just\nstop. You owe yourself 30 seconds to\nlook up over the South Massif and look\nat the Earth."\nThey assembled and flew the flag, and\nafter the now-ritual salutes and pictures,\nCernan talked to Houston: ". . . this flag\nhas flown in the MOCR (Mission Operations Control Room) since Apollo 11,\nand we very proudly deploy it . . . in\nhonor of all those people who have\nworked so hard to put us here.\nThen they unloaded the Apollo Lunar\nSurface Experiments Package (ALSEP),\nand assembled it into a barbell package\nfor easier carrying. Schmitt made a\ngravimeter reading for calibration of\nthat instrument, and they were off to\ndeploy the ALSEP, Schmitt loping into\nthe distance carrying the unit. But Cernan\nhad knocked a fender off the rover by\ncatching it with his hammer, and stayed\nbehind to fix it. He made a temporary\nbinding from an adhesive tape, and joined\nSchmitt at the ALSEP site.\nIt was Cernan\'s job to drill the two\nholes for the heat probe experiment.\n"Man, is that thing biting," he said about\nthe drill. And later, he added, "I\'m in\nsomething tough down there now\nmust be in the mother lode. ... Boy,\nthe old fingers really suffer on these......\nBut he completed the job, with both\nprobes driven to their planned depth.\n"Hey, Bob, just out of curiosity, what\nkind of heart rate has this drill been\nproducing on me?" Cernan queried. And\nCapcom answered, ".. . you\'ve been\nrunning at 120 pulse speed with peaks\nof 140 to 150 from time to time."\nCernan had to drill again, this time a\nten-foot probe for the neutron flux\nexperiment. He was beginning to feel the\neffects of the unaccustomed strain of\nworking against the constraint of the\npressure suit, and complained of arm\npains when this job was done.\nThe next task was a rover ride to a\npoint near the crater Steno, named after\nNicholas Stenonis, a 17th century Danish\nscientist. On the way, the rover stopped\nbriefly at the site selected for the\nSurface Electrical Properties (SEP)\nexperiment, and Schmitt placed the\ntransmitter on the surface. On toward\nSteno they went, and collecting rock\nsamples, taking photos, and making\na gravimeter reading for another point\non the gravity profile traverse.\n\nAstronaut Cernan, at the wheel, checks the\nlunar rover in a short test ride.\n\nFinished with the check ride, the lunar rover is\nready to roll.\nThen it was back to the Surface\nElectrical Properties experiment (SEP)\nsite for deployment of its transmitter\nantennas, placing them carefully\nin a set of right-angled tire tracks driven\non the location earlier by Cernan. On the\nway back the broken tape gave way on\nthe fender splice, and the fender was lost\nsomewhere on the surface. "Oh, it pretty\nnear makes me sick at losing that\nfender," Cernan said.\nBack at the lunar module after these\njobs, Cernan and Schmitt dusted off the\nrover, and were getting ready to re-enter\nthe module when Cernan was startled by\nsomething. Hey, something just hit here!\nWhat blew? Hey, what is that?" Schmitt\nhad the answer. "It\'s the styrofoam off\nthe high-gain antenna backing."\nCapcom called with a request for a\ncomplete description of what happened\nto the rear fender, and the extent of the\ndamage. They planned to think and work\non the problem during the rest period\nfor the astronauts, and to get back to\nthem with some temporary fix if possible.\nFor the rest of the stay on the surface,\nCernan and Schmitt spent the time\ndusting themselves off. "How\'d you get\nso dirty?" asked Cernan, and Schmitt\nretorted, "Huh, just wait until I show you\na picture I took of you."\nAll of the experiments had been\nemplaced properly, and all were checked\nout as operative. They had made 6\nreadings with the gravimeter, placed 2\nexplosive charges for the seismic\nexperiments, taken 229 color pictures\nand 197 black-and-white pictures,\ncollected one deep drill core and 17\nsamples of rocks and rake fragments, a\ntotal of about 13 kilograms (about 29\npounds).\nThen up the ladder and into the lunar\nmodule, ending the first EVA. They closed\nthe hatch and repressurized the module.\nThe time of the EVA was 7 hours,\n12 minutes and 13 seconds, and there\nwere two tired astronauts at the end of\nthat day\'s work.\n"Oh, what a nice day. . . there\'s not a\ncloud in the sky," said Schmitt as he\nstarted his trip down the ladder for the\nsecond EVA. He joined Cernan on the\nsurface and, after the usual first-thing\nchecks, the two astronauts attached\ntheir new fender. This history-making\nevent\xe2\x80\x94the first automotive repair on the\nMoon\xe2\x80\x94had been figured out at MSC\nwhile the crew slept. Essentially it\n\n10\n\nconsisted of taping together four\nplasticized map sheets that would not be\nused, folding them once and fastening\nthem to the fender rails with clamps\ncannibalized from the optical alignment\ntelescope lamp.\nThe reason for the seriousness of this\napparently minor problem was the dust\nplume thrown up by the lunar rover\nwheel. Without that rear fender, the\nsurface dust was thrown onto the\nastronauts and the equipment on the\nrover, aggravating an already annoying\nsituation.\nThe fender fix worked, and the day\'s\ntasks began.\nThe first stop was scheduled to be\nStation 2, near the crater Nansen, named\nafter Fridtjof Nansen, a Norwegian Arctic\nexplorer. On the way, they drove south of\nthe crater Camelot, and Schmitt described as they rode: "The surface is\nnot changing in terms of the detail. The\nsurface texture of the fine grained\nregolith still is a raindrop pattern.\nOccasional craters show lighter colored\nejectas all the way down to, say, half a\nmeter in size. . . . Most of the brighter\ncraters have a little central pit in the\nbottom which is glass lined. The pit is\nmaybe a fifth of the diameter of the\ncrater itself."\nAfter more than an hour, during which\nthey had stopped for samples and to set\ntwo more explosive charges, Cernan and\nSchmitt arrived at Station 2, lying at the\nbase of the South Massif, at the contact\narea between the massif and the lunar\nmantle. Here the samples and observations were directed toward describing the\nmassif bedrock and the light mantle.\nCernan and Schmitt spent almost an\nhour here, gathering samples and photographically documenting them and the\nregion. Then they drove the rover on\ntoward Station 3, the crater Lara, named\nafter the heroine of "Dr. Zhivago."\nThe same sampling routine followed,\nand they packed the specimens and\nheaded on to Station 4, the crater\nShorty, named after a character in\nRichard Brautigan\'s novel, "Trout Fishing\nin America."\nAnd there, almost five hours into the\nEVA, Schmitt was standing on the rim of\nShorty and calmly describing its physical\nappearance.

Crazy. Orange\nIt\'s almost the same color as the LMP\ndecal on my camera."\nCernan: "That is orange, Jack."\nQuoting the words doesn\'t convey the\nsense of excitement that this discovery\ncaused. And why? Because the presence\nof the reddish-orange material around\nthe crater points to its volcanic origin,\nand suggests volcanic activity both\nbefore and after the formation of the\nlight mantle.\nSaid Schmitt: "If I ever saw a classic\nalteration halo around a volcanic crater,\nthis is it. It\'s ellipsoidal. It appears to be\nzoned. There\'s one sample we didn\'t\nget. We didn\'t get the more yellowy stuff,\nwe got the center portion......\nAfter this, the rest of the EVA was\nalmost anti-climactic. They drove on to\nStation 5 at Camelot crater, collected\nsamples, and then pushed on to the\nALSEP site for another check of the lunar\nsurface gravimeter. Indications were\nthat the instrument was not working, and\nthe scientists back in Houston wanted\nto make certain that it had been correctly\ninstalled and was level. Schmitt\nconfirmed that.\nThey arrived back at the lunar module,\ncleaned up the rover and turned off the\ntelevision camera. It had been a second\nfull day. They had traveled a distance of\nabout 20 kilometers (12 miles) and had\nworked on the Moon for 7 hours, 37\nminutes and 22 seconds. They had taken\n218 color photographs and 627 blackand-white photographs, and collected\n56 samples weighing about 36 kilograms\n(80 pounds). The scientific experiments\nwere working properly, except for the\nlunar surface gravimeter.\nIn the final minutes before mounting\nthe ladder and entering the lunar module,\nCernan looked around. "I stand out here\nand I look at that flag, and I look at the\nrover, and I look at those feet. It\'s still\nhard to believe." And Schmitt answered\nby wondering what they had done to\ndeserve being out there.\n\ns about 4:30 Wednesday\nafternoon, as I step out on to the plains\nof Taurus-Littrow\'s beautiful valley," said\nAstronaut Cernan at the start of the third\nEVA. He and Schmitt did their usual\nroutine checks and make-ready tasks\nbefore setting out in the lunar rover about\na half-hour later. They drove toward\nStation 6 at the base of the North Massif,\nstopping on the way at about half the\ndistance for sampling of the surface.\nThey paused again at Turning Point\nRock, named because it was a prominent\nlandmark on their course and the place\nwhere they were to turn to head toward\nStation 6. That rock, perhaps 6 meters\nhigh, was photographed and observed at\nclose range before the trip continued.\nThey parked the lunar rover on the\nslope near the base of the massif and\nbegan their sampling and documentation.\n"Man, here\'s a big white clast, and\nthere\'s one on top about a foot and a\nhalf across, and here\'s one must be two\nfeet across . . . three feet. . . and that\'s\nin the blue-gray," reported Cernan,\ndescribing some of the local rocks of a\ntype that geologists have labelled\n"breccias," or rocks which are made of\nfragments of specific materials. Bluegray, of course, refers to the color of\nthe rock.\n"Feel like a kid playing in a sandbox,"\nsaid the exuberant Cernan, in the middle\nof his reporting. And then Capcom came\non the air with instructions: "We\'re ready\nfor you guys to leave this rock . . . and\neither get the rake soil and cores near\nthat crater down below the rock . . . or\nelse go on to some other different variety\nof rock......\nSchmitt answered, ". . . going down\nto that crater is not a problem; getting\nback up Is."\nCapcom: "...it\'s not that vital to get\nto that crater. . . if it\'s that much of a\njob to get down to it and back up."\nSchmitt: "Okay. Bob, we don\'t move\naround from here too much. I tell you,\nthese slopes are something else."\nBefore they left the site, Cernan called\nin an accident report: "Houston, we\'ve\ngot a couple of dented tires." "What\'s a\ndented tire?" queried Capcom, and\nCernan responded, "A dented tire is a\nlittle . . . golfball size or smaller indentation in the mesh. How does that sound\nto you?" "Sounds like a dented tire,"\nsaid Capcom. But the damage was\nnegligible and would not prevent the\nlunar rover from continuing to do its job.\n\nApollo 17 Commander Cernan in the lunar\nmodule.\n\n13\n\nFrom Station 6 to Station 7, just off the\nslopes of the massif was a matter of a\nfive-minute drive. First things first at the\nsite; Capcom asked Cernan to dust off\nthe mirror and the lens of the television.\nAnd Cernan came back with, "You know\nwhat? I\'m getting tired of dusting. My\nprimary tool\'s the dust brush......\nBy working at both stations 6 and 7,\nthe astronauts had documented the\nstructure of the base of the massif, first\na distance up the slope and then a\ndistance into the plain at its foot. At\nStation 8, another position at the base of\nthe massif, they continued their\ngeological field trip, with sampling and\ndocumentation. And Schmitt made some\nobservations on lunar locomotion: "This\nis the best way for me to travel, up hill or\ndown hill . . . like this two-legged hop\nMan, I can cover ground like a\nkangaroo!"\nCernan continued to comment on the\ndust and the way it got into everything.\nwe sure are giving this suspension\nsystem (of the rover) a workout . . .\ncan\'t even see it. . . everything\'s getting\nawful dusty." Schmitt, confirming that,\nadded, "Boy, everything is stiff. Everything is just full of dust." But Cernan had\nthe last word: "There\'s got to be a point\nwhere the dust just overtakes you and\neverything mechanical quits moving."\nThey left Station 8 after 47 minutes of\nsampling and headed on to Station 9,\non the rim of Van Serg crater and near\nthe rims of three others: Shakespeare,\nCochise and Gatsby.\nAfter about a half hour of work in the\narea, Capcom advised the astronauts\nthat it was time to go, and suggested that\nthey leave ". . . immediately if not sooner\nto head for Station 10." There was a\nbrief flurry of activity, and then Schmitt\'s\nvoice broke through in excitement.\n"Come here, Gene, quickly. We can\'t\nwe can\'t leave this. This may be the\nyoungest mantle over whatever was\nthrown out of the craters." "Take pictures\nof it," answered Cernan, and then\nspeaking to Capcom, he added, "Bob,\nwe\'ve got to take five more minutes.\nwhat Jack\'s doing is he\'s dug a trench\nin the southwest-northeast direction ani\nhe discovered about three inches belov.\nthe surface a very light gray material\na possibility here is that. . . this upper\nsix inches of gray material . .. is the\nlatest mantling in the area and the light-\n\n14\n\ncolored debris may be what\'s left over\nfrom the impact."\nCapcom, now concerned about the\nduration of their stay on the surface at\nthis distance from the protection of the\nlunar module, came on again: "Okay, I\ncopy. I understand. But we\'d like to get\nyou going, in case you didn\'t get the\nclue."\nBut Schmitt, ever the professional\ngeologist, was reluctant to leave this\nexciting and unexpected find, and Cernan\nseemed to share his view.

Capcom added,\n"We\'d also like to have you moving in\n4 minutes. That\'s with wheels rolling\nin 4 minutes."\nThere was more argument, Cernan\nsaying that he didn\'t know if that could\nbe done, Capcom insisting, and Cernan\nsaying that they could not get that special\nsample in 4 minutes. Capcom agreed\nto eliminate it, and Cernan said, "Let\'s\nroll."\nThey left Station 9 and headed back\nto the lunar module, calling in observations as they passed craters on the way\nback. At about 5 hours and 44 minutes\nafter they had set out, they arrived back\nat the home base for the last time this\ntrip. They still had work at that site:\nphotography, a final check of the ALSEP,\nand the tasks of clean-up after the\ncontinuing problem with the lunar dust.\nBut there were some other, non-work\ntasks that remained, too, and Cernan, as\ncommander of the Apollo 17 mission, was\nits spokesman. He spoke to the International Youth Science Tour that was in\nHouston that day, watching some of the\nactivity by television transmission from\nthe lunar surface. Cernan told them that,\nJack has picked up a very significant\nrock . . . composed of many fragments, of\nmany sizes and many shapes, probably\nfrom all parts of the Moon, probably billions of years old. But a rock of all sizes\nand shapes, . . . and even colors, that\nhave grown together to become a cohesive rock outlasting the nature of\nspace, sort of living together in a very\ncoherent, very peaceful manner. . . we\'d\nlike to share a piece of this rock with so\nmany of the countries throughout the\nworld. We hope that this will be a symbol\nof what our feelings are......\nAnd Schmitt added that portions of\nthe rock will be sent to museums or\nother agencies in each of the countries\nrepresented by the young people in\nHouston on that day.\nThen Commander Cernan again,\nspeaking for Apollo 17 and all the Apollo\nmissions that came before: "We\'d like\nto uncover a plaque that has been on\nthe leg of our spacecraft. .. I\'ll read\nwhat that plaque says. . . \'Here man\ncompleted his first exploration of the\nMoon December 1972 A.D. May the\nspirit of peace in which we came be\nreflected in the lives of all mankind.\'\n\nIt was a serious moment, but it wasn\'t\nthe finale of the spectacle. That finale\nwould have been the last routine checks\nbefore boarding the lunar module. But\nCapcom had some final words about the\nlunar surface gravimeter experiment,\nwhich still wasn\'t working; the scientists\nwanted to make one more try.\nSo Capcom told Schmitt "Tap sharply\non the gimbal with the UHT (Universal\nHandling Tool) and then reverify the\nlevel\nSchmitt: "You mean tap on the thing\nthat swings?"\nCapcom: "That\'s what they say."\nSchmitt: "You always wanted to do\nthat, didn\'t you?"\nCapcom: "Yeah, that\'s right."\nSchmitt: "How much is sharply?"\nCapcom: "Sharply is sharply. It\'s\nprobably not heavily, but sharply. Fairly\nlight, but sharply."\nSchmitt: "Okay, here it goes. I did It\nthat was sort of a moderate tap."\nCapcom: "Go ahead and hit it harder."\nSchmitt: "Okay. Okay? I can hit it\nharder yet."\nThat didn\'t do it, and Schmitt was\nreleased to work on other tasks. But a\nfew minutes later, back came Capcom,\nwith more instructions. "We\'d like to\nreturn to the surface gravimeter, Jack\nwe\'d like you to rap even more\nsharply, more strongly on the gimbal\nanother three times."\nSchmitt: "Okay, Bob. Here come the\nraps. About three times. Okay."\nCapcom: "Okay, Jack, that\'s really\nfighting it pretty hard."\nAnd still there were no measurable\nresults. And, after more talk and tasks,\nCapcom finally closed out the experiment\nattempt: "Okay, Jack, we\'re ready to\nleave the ALSEP."\n"I hate to do that, Bob. I\'m sorry about\nthis gravimeter," said Schmitt.\nAnd Capcom responded, "Well, you\'re\nnot the only one . . . there\'s a whole\nroom full of people that are sorry."\nFor the last time, they closed out the\ncheck list, moved the sample bags into\nthe lunar module, and prepared for the\nlast steps up the ladder.\n"Okay, you guys, say farewell to the\nMoon," said Capcom, and Cernan\nanswered, "Bob, this is Gene, and I\'m\non the surface . . . as we leave the\nMoon at Taurus-Littrow, we leave as we\ncame, and, God willing, we shall return,\nwith peace and hope for all mankind."\n\nAstronaut Schmitt at the lunar rover with South\nMassif in the background.\n\n19\n\nThe nearly full Moon looms serenely in the\nblack sky for the crew of Apollo 17.\n\nAscent From Taurus-Littrow\n\nThe mission operations control room\nis again crowded, in contrast to much of\nthe flight when many of the control and\nmonitoring positions are not needed. But\nnow perhaps fifty specialists sit at\nconsoles on which are displayed\ntelevision presentations of data, curves,\npictures. On the edges are amber lights\nin a matrix, with an occasional one\nblinking on and off. On the wall ahead,\nthere are three large panels. The left\nshows columns of printed parameters\nfor the ascent. On the center panel are\nfour graphs, showing precomputed\ncurves of performance for the ascent\nphase. On the right, the projected\ntelevision picture from the surface shows\nmomentarily, then is replaced by another\nchart.\nCommunications are established\nbetween the surface of the Moon, the\norbiting module, and the communicator\nin the mission operations control room.\nThere is a pre-liftoff go-no-go check in\nthe room, with the voice of flight control\nquerying each major desk in turn and\ngetting the sharp, "Go!" from each.\nNow the room is quiet, and the\ncontroller\'s voice comes on again.\n"Make your transmissions nice and slow,\nguys. Let\'s keep it very cool." And there\nis a quiet assent among the desks.\nOn the lunar surface, Cernan and\nSchmitt have completed their preparations for the ascent into lunar orbit and\nthe rendezvous with Evans in the\ncommand/service module. They\npressurize the lunar module, and start\nthe last checklist of actions before the\nfinal countdown to ignition. Cernan tells\nwhat he is going to do In those last\nseconds, and Schmitt acknowledges.\nCernan\'s voice comes on, counts down\nthe last seconds. The watching audience\nin the viewing area sees, on television\nscreens, the spidery-looking lunar\nmodule standing desolate and lonely on\nthe surface. Then there is a burst of\naction; particles blast away from the\ninvisible flame of the ascent engine, and\nthe upper stage of the lunar module\ndetaches smoothly and lifts into the lunar\nheavens.\nSteadily, smoothly, rapidly it rises,\nreducing into a barely recognizable\ngeometric solid, and then to a glow of\nlight in the blackness. Across the\ntelevision screens it moves, off the lower\nleft-hand corner. There is a collective\nintake of breath by those watching.\n\n20\n\nThen the data points and communications\ncome rapidly.\nAcross the projected images at the\nfront of the control room, red and white\ndata points march in orderly lines, easing\naround the predrawn curves, aligned with\nyellow curves on yellow grids. They\ncrowd in almost perfect agreement with\nthe computed data, and the voices\nbetween ground and the ascent stage\ncontinue to confirm that all is going well.\nSlowly the data points move along,\nslowly approaching the ends of the lines\nand the attainment of lunar orbit. This is\ncritical now; the ascent stage must orbit\nwithin closely defined dimensions to\nrendezvous with the command/\nservice module in the inky reaches of\nspace.\nAnd now they reach the ends of the\nlines, and the red and white circles and\ncrosses hide the nominal values figured\nearlier as datum lines. Cernan\'s voice\ncalls off the orbital parameters from his\non-board computer, and the control\nvoice affirms. They are in lunar orbit.\nSomeone in the control room starts to\napplaud. Everyone joins in a collective\ngesture of relief, pride, joy, enthusiasm.\n\nAnd they file out, in twos and threes, as\nthe voices continue to affirm the orbit,\nto discuss the advisability of "tweaking"\nit for more precise alignment of the two\nspacecraft, and to work on fixing or\nimproving the communications which\nare giving some minor problems.\nBut the major task has been done.\nThe Moon is below now and they are\nwaiting for the rendezvous.\nThe television camera mounted on the\nlunar rover scans the lunar surface, still\nin a wide-angle setting from tracking\nthe ascent. There, apparently far off,\nstands the descent stage of the lunar\nmodule, alone now, its task done. The\ncamera zooms in for a closer look at the\nmetallic spider in predatory pose, its\ngolden legs glistening in the strong pale\nlight. The camera holds on the module\nfor a moment, and then cuts off. The\nscreen is ribbed with bright bands of\ncolor, and the Moon\'s surface and the\nlonely module are blotted from sight.\nAcolor television monitor in Mission Control\nrecords the instant of lift-off as Challenger\'s\nascent stage begins the first leg of Apollo 17\'s\ntrip back to Earth.\n\nS\t\n\n-\n\nAV\n\nA\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n.\t\n\n4\n(C\n\n\'\n.4t\n\nPA I\nIIt.i;\n\n\'\'r\' \xe2\x80\xa2\'fTP\nLEJ\' "\n\nChallengers ascent stage is the rendezvous\ntarget as Ron Evans eases the command/\nservice module through the docking maneuver.\nAstronaut Cernan\'s face is seen in triangular\nrendezvous and docking window on the right\nof the LM,\n\n22\n\nRendezvous With America\n\nAnd now in lunar orbit, Challenger and\nAmerica eased toward each other for the\ncritical rendezvous in lunar orbit, the\nachievement of the concept that made\nthe entire Apollo mission possible. The\nChallenger ascent stage moved into an\nelliptical orbit around the Moon, closing\nto within 16.2 kilometers (9.3 nautical\nmiles) of the lunar surface and reaching\na maximum distance of 88.7 kilometers\n(47.9 nautical miles). Astronaut Evans,\nin the command/ service module, was\nin a near-circular orbit 114.8 kilometers\n(62 nautical miles) above the surface.\nChallenger saw America first, at about\n207 kilometers (112 nautical miles).\nHouston transmitted orbital corrections\nto Challenger, so that the two orbits\nwould be brought together for the final\nphase of the lunar rendezvous. Then\nEvans\' voice came through, confirming\nthat he could see the Challenger\nspacecraft.\nChallenger, behind America, closed\nrapidly on the spacecraft. Evans, in\nAmerica, said: "I just started picking you\nup on the telescope . . . I don\'t care\nwhat you look like, come on back. I was\ngoing to shave and look nice for you, but\nI didn\'t have time......\nSoon after, both spacecraft moved\nbehind the Moon and their signals\nwere lost. Hidden from the monitors\non Earth, Challenger\'s ascent engine\nagain thrust-sharply and briefly, nudging\nthe spacecraft out of its elliptical orbit\ninto an intersecting path with the course\nof the command module. Then out of the\nshadow they came, checking in with\nHouston and getting down to the fine\ndetails of rendezvous.\n"I can see your thrusters firing now,\nRon."\nMore exchanges of closing data, and\nthen Evans said, "Looks like Challenger\'s\nin good shape. I don\'t see anything\nhanging down....\'" She\'s in excellent\nshape," Cernan answered, and added,\nyou look pretty."\nThen slowly, slowly the two vehicles\nclosed the distance between them, Evans\nmaneuvering to line up the spacecraft\nfor the docking maneuver. "Okay, coming\nin nice and slow . . . no problems."\n"You\'re looking good.. . looking good\nlooking good.. . must be a couple\nof feet away . . . about two or three feet\nis all."\nThe first touching placed the two\nspacecraft in soft lock, without final\n\nlatching and locking accomplished.\nThere were some minutes of maneuvering, backing off, recapture and then\nChallenger spoke: "Okay . . . here he\ncomes. Bang, two good old barber poles!\nOkay, Houston, we\'re hard docked."\nThe barber poles, indicators on the\ncommand panels of Challenger,\nshowed the latching. Challenger and\nAmerica once again were a single\nspacecraft in lunar orbit.\nEvans removed the probe and drogue\nassemblies and passed them through the\nairlock to Cernan and Schmitt, along\nwith a vacuum cleaner and a list of the\nitems that needed to be transferred from\nChallenger to the command module.\nEmptied, Challenger\'s ascent stage was\nsealed off from the command module and\nthe three astronauts were back together\n\nin the command module for another day\nof work in lunar orbit before the start of\nthe long voyage homeward.\n"Don\'t let us bother you, Ron," said\none of the returning astronauts. "You\njust go about and do whatever you want\nto do. We\'ll just get clean for the next\nthree days."\nThen the Challenger ascent stage was\nseparated and, behind the Moon, nudged\ninto a trajectory that would take it down\nto do its last job: crash on the Moon to\nget one more set of data points on the\nseismic instrumentation.\nA good view of the Scientific Instrument Module\nbay is seen as the command/service module\nAmerica maneuvers near Challengers\nascent stage prior to docking.\n\n23\n\n\t\n\nTurning Toward\nThe Planet Earth\n\n"Bob, that\'s the most beautiful crescent\nEarth I\'ve ever seen," radioed one of\nthe astronauts just before the end of\ntheir 67th revolution around the Moon.\nThey were nearing the end of the long\nexploratory work that had begun with\ntheir first visual sightings of the lunar\nsurface, expanded through the work on\nthe surface by Cernan and Schmitt, and\ncontinued with visual observations of\nthe Moon during the orbits after ascent\nand rendezvous.\nThat phase was to continue for only\neight more turns around the Moon, and\nthen the trans-Earth injection burn would\nbe done, in the shadow of the Moon,\nafter the 75th revolution. As they\nemerged from behind the Moon,they\nwould be headed back toward Earth\nand splashdown in the Pacific.\nNow the last data were sent to update\ncomputers for the burn. "Okay, Jack,\nhere\'s the numbers you\'ve been waiting\nfor," said Capcom. "TEl rev 75 SPS/G&N\n36 372 plus 063 plus 086. Noun 33 is\n236 4208 35 plus 30398 minus 01850......\nThe signals went on in lengthy\nprocession, and soon after, the spacecraft moved behind the Moon and signal\nwas lost.\nThe times of signal loss always make\nfor tension. The success or failure of\noperations done behind the Moon never\nis known until the spacecraft returns\nto the near side and radio contact can\nbe re-established.\nThere was an expected dividend on\nthis flight; it was to be only the second\ntime that television from an Apollo\nspacecraft could show pictures of the\nfar side of the Moon. The reason was that\nthe burn on the far side would propel\nthe spacecraft into a higher altitude,\nenabling contact with the Earth to be\nestablished earlier than usual.

Schmitt reviewed some of\nthe results:\nwe have pretty good evidence as\na result of the Apollo program that.\nbasalt flows . . . some three to four\nbillion years ago erupted on the Moon\nand filled many of the lower areas that\nexisted at the time. Not an awful lot has\nhappened to the Moon\xe2\x80\x94except for the\nimpact craters, some of the younger\nones\xe2\x80\x94since three billion years ago,\nwhich is one of the reasons it becomes\n\nso interesting to man. . . . The Moon\'s\nfrozen in a period of history three billion\nyears and older, which is a period of\nhistory we cannot recognize very readily\non Earth because of the dynamic\nprocesses of mountain building and\noceans and weathering that are taking\nplace even at the present time. Understanding that early history of the Moon\nmay mean an understanding of the early\nhistory of the Earth. And I think we\'re\nwell on our way to a first-order understanding of that history as a result of\nthe program."\n\nThe Eratosthenes Crater and the southern\ntip of the Apennine range are seen below the\nlunar module.\n\nP%\n\n:\n\nI\n\n-\t\n\n.\t . \t\n\n.\t\n\n.\t\nIlk\nS.\n\na,\nI,\t\n\nI\t\n\na-\t\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 ti\t j..\n\n\',\r\n\n-\'Ar\n\n\t\n\nAcrescent Earth rises over the Moon in this\nphotograph taken from lunar orbit by Astronaut\nRon Evans.\n\nph\n\nI\n\nAN\n\nI_JI\n-\n\nAstronauts C..rnan and Evans weightlessly drift\ninto :a ! nt:rd range jt\xe2\x80\xa2.-.:rt Arn.-\'i\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 II\n\n*..S_\n\n\xc2\xa3\t\n\n-\t\n-\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\n.\n\n\'\t\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2-.-\n\n].\t\n-.\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\n-\t\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2.\r\n\n&\n\n\\\\\t\n\n.\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\n\\\n\nN\n-\t\n\n-\t\n\n-\n\n\\\n\n.\t\n\nIL\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n_\n\n\'\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\'\t\n\nt\'.\t\n\nY\t\n\n\\\\%.\t\n\n\'\'\t\n\n.. \'\n\n.4\n\nReturn, Re-entry And Recovery\n\nThe trip home was as routine as any\ntrip back from the Moon could be. There\nwas the excitement of Astronaut Ron\nEvans\' excursion outside the command\nmodule to retrieve the film cassettes\nfrom the instrument bay in the service\nmodule, and his euphoric comments\nduring that spectacular space walk. He\ngot the film and returned it, and he\ncommented on the view, the external\ncondition of the spacecraft, spoke to his\ntwo children, sang, and generally\nbehaved as others have who personally\nencounter space, freed of the shackles\nof a confining spacecraft.\nThe final test of the spacecraft and its\nsystems came during the last minutes of\nthe flight and the blazing re-entry through\nthe Earth\'s atmosphere. The command\nand service modules separated, and\nCernan maneuvered the command\nmodule to position it for the re-entry, its\nheat shield facing into the direction of\nflight. And about 304 hours after the\nspacecraft had lifted off the pad at Cape\nKennedy, it slammed into the Earth\'s\natmosphere, in a streaming, flaming dive\ntoward the surface. Behind it trailed the\ntongues of flame from the instant\ncombustion and ionization of the heatshield material.\nThen there was loss of radio contact,\nas the spacecraft plunged into the\nblackout zone, where the ionization from\nthe burning heat shield hides all radio\ntransmission. After a long and agonizing\nthree minutes, voice contact came\nthrough again and then the atmosphere\nbegan to slow the craft, the drag force\npressing the astronauts into their\ncontoured seats with more than six times\ntheir normal weight.\nThen there was the welcome sudden\ndeceleration as the three drogue parachutes streamed behind the spacecraft,\nslowing it further. And, less than a minute\nlater, the three main braking parachutes\nstreamed, and blossomed behind and\nthen above the descending command\nmodule. Down it came, dropping slowly\ntoward the calm blue Pacific, and\nsplashed down into the pattern of threefoot waves within sight of the recovery\nship.\nCernan, Evans and Schmitt were back\nhome, back home on Earth, back home\non a small blue world in a dark corner of\nthe galaxy.\n\n26\n\nRon Evans retrieving exposed film and tape\ncassettes from the open bay in the side of the\nservice module during a "spacewalk\' on the\nreturn trip to Earth.\n\nRecovery helicopter uses its rescue sling to\nlift the astronauts from the life raft next to the\nfloating Apollo command module.

For months\nand years to come, the measurements\nfrom Apollo 17 and its predecessor\nmissions will continue to provide bases\nfor understanding and argument about\nthe Moon, the Earth, and their very\nancient histories.\nFor science moves deliberately\xe2\x80\x94some\nmight say slowly\xe2\x80\x94to analyze data taken\nduring experiments. The sheer volume\nof data\xe2\x80\x94already measured in the tens of\nbillions of data points\xe2\x80\x94precludes any\nrapid results. Further, some of the\nexperiments that were emplaced on the\nMoon are designed for long-term exposure and are intended to return raw\ndata for several years.\nBut there are preliminary results from\nsome of the tests. The lunar seismic\nprofiling experiment, for example, which\nuses explosive charges to explore the\ninterior of the Moon, already has noted\nthe impulse of the lunar module ascent\nengine firing, and the impact of the spent\nmodule after it impacted back on the\nMoon. The small explosive charges left\non the surface were detonated after the\nastronauts had returned to lunar orbit,\nand showed that the sub-surface structure of the Apollo 17 site was definitely\ndifferent from that of either Apollo\n15 or 16.\nThat lunar module impact, plus the\nmuch earlier impact of the spent Saturn\nS-IVB stage, registered on the passive\nseismology experiment previously\ndeployed on the Moon. And these two\nshocks, which doubled the amount of\nprevious data, have shown the possibility\nthat the Moon\'s crust is considerably\nthinner than the 60 kilometers (37.2\nmiles) earlier postulated. It\'s possible,\nsaid one scientist, that the thickness is\nonly 25 kilometers. But there was prompt\ndisagreement from another scientist,\nand the final results are yet to come.\nThe heat flow from the lunar crust\nappears to confirm the results of Apollo\n15, which surprised the scientists with\nits high value. What this means is that\nthe interior of the Moon may be warmer\nthan expected, and this in turn hints at\nlarge quantities of radioactive materials\nin the lunar structure. There appears\nto be a much higher concentration of\nthose materials on the Moon than there is\non the Earth, leading to further argu-\n\n28\n\nments against the theory that the Moon\nwas torn from the mass of the Earth.\nFirst results from the lunar traverse\ngravimeter show that there is a highdensity material filling the valley between\nthe North and South Massifs, with greater\nthickness than expected. The implication, then, is that the valley originally was\na very deep one, prior to its flooding\nfrom the Mare Serenitatis.\nGeologically, there was a feeling that\neverything planned had been accomplished. The surface samples, the\ndetailed documentation and observation\nof large boulders and surface features,\nand the visual descriptions of the surface\nby the astronauts during their EVA and\norbital times, added immeasurably to\nman\'s knowledge of the Moon.\nThe orbital science experiments,\noriented toward geophysics in contrast\nto earlier missions that concentrated on\ngeochemistry, worked to near-perfection.\nFive continuous revolutions\' worth of\ndata were obtained by the laser altimeter,\nwhich added to altitude profile data,\nand the continuity of the data will help\nrecover gravity information as well.\nThe panoramic and mapping cameras,\nwhich recorded the lunar surface on\nseveral miles of film, should produce the\nbest series of maps yet developed for\nthe Moon.\nThe lunar sounder, designed to probe\nthe depths of the Moon with electromagnetic signals, acquired that data\nalong a 49,000-kilometer (38,000-mile)\ntrack and returned more than 500 million\nsoundings. All of that data was recorded\non film, and will have to be processed\nand analyzed after the return to Earth.\nThe infra-red scanning radiometer\nproduced coverage of about one-third of\nthe surface area of the Moon, and made\nabout 100 million independent temperature measurements, during both day\nand night on the Moon. These points,\nwhich will produce thermal maps of the\nMoon, will lead to a new technique for\nexploration of planetary surfaces that\nlack an atmosphere.\nThe ultraviolet spectrometer experiment, whose prime function was to\nmeasure the lunar atmosphere, was\nunable to detect evidence of any major\nor even minor constituents of that\natmosphere. In fact, all it recorded was\none trace component of the lunar\natmosphere. Said the principal investiga-\n\ntor of that experiment, "What\'s behind\nus is the rather startling discovery that\nthe Moon simply is not de-gassing; it has\nnothing left in terms of anything that\nwould create an atmosphere."\nA panoramic view of the ALSEP site taken\nduring EVA 1.

In their\nlate thirties, all three had long experience\nin their specialties. Cernan and Evans\nwere from the Navy, and had been pilots;\nboth had engineering degrees. Schmitt\nwas the first professional scientist to\ngo on a space mission, being a hard-rock\ngeologist.\nEugene A. Cernan, born in Chicago\nin 1934, was an engineering graduate in\nElectrical Engineering from Purdue\nUniversity, and holds a master of science\ndegree in Aeronautical Engineering from\nthe U.S. Naval Postgraduate School.\nHe was commissioned in the Navy\nthrough the ROTC program at Purdue,\nentered flight training just after graduation, and has since logged more than\n3,800 hours of flight time. He is a Navy\nCaptain, and was one of the third group\nof astronauts, selected in October 1963.\nSpace flight is not new to Cernan. He\nshared the Gemini 9 mission as co-pilot to\ncommand pilot Thomas P. Stafford, and\ncompleted a two-hour space walk outside that spacecraft. He was lunar module\npilot for the Apollo 10 mission, the\ndress rehearsal for all that came after,\nand flew that spacecraft to within 14.8\nkilometers (8 nautical miles) of the\nMoon\'s surface. On Apollo 17, he was\ncrew commander.\nRonald E. Evans was born in St.\nFrancis, Kansas, in 1933. His training\nincluded a bachelor of science degree in Electrical Engineering from the\nUniversity of Kansas, and a master of\nscience degree in Aeronautical Engineering from the U.S. Naval Postgraduate\nSchool. Commissioned after ROTC at\nthe University of Kansas, he flew naval\naircraft in tours of duty on carriers. When\nNASA notified him of his selection as an\nastronaut in April 1966, he was serving\nin the Pacific aboard the USS Ticonderoga, the same carrier that was to become\nthe recovery ship for the astronauts of\nApollo 17 more than six years later.\nThis flight is his first into space; but he\nhas been a backup and support crew\nmember on earlier Apollo missions. He\nwas Apollo 17 command module pilot.\nHarrison H. Schmitt was born in Santa\nRita, New Mexico, in 1935, the son of a\nmining geologist. His undergraduate\nwork was done at California Institute of\nTechnology, and after post-graduate\n\nstudies at the University of Oslo in\nNorway, he received his doctorate in\ngeology from Harvard University.\nHe was selected as an astronaut by\nNASA in June 1965 and went through\nmore than a year of flight training to\nlearn the piloting skills necessary to the\nmission. With more than 1665 hours\nflying time logged, Schmitt was selected\nas the lunar module pilot for the Apollo\n17 trip.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2.\n\nEugene A. Cernan, Captain, U.S. Navy\nRonald E.

More accurately, it is an\nimportant way-point in the exploration\nof space by manned and unmanned\nspacecraft. Apollo 17 was the last of\nthe manned Apollo missions; but it is far\nfrom being the last manned space flight\neffort.\nAt this moment, the first of the Skylab\norbital workshops and its launch vehicle\nare standing assembled in the huge\nVehicle Assembly Building (VAB) at\nNASA\'s Kennedy Space Center. Due\nto be launched in mid 1973, the\nSkylabs will be used for a wide range\nof scientific and medical experiments,\naimed primarily at understanding the requirements for long-term stays in space.\nIn Skylab, the first emphasis will be\nproperly placed on a series of medical\nexperiments to determine how well\nman can adapt to the conditions of longterm exposure to the peculiar characteristics of space. Additionally, a number\nof solar astronomy experiments will be\nperformed, studying the Sun through\nthe uncluttered distance between an onboard telescope and our primary star.\nPotentially the most valuable of the\nSkylab experiments, in their possible\napplications to the problems of everyday\nlife, are a series of Earth surveys that\nwill be made. Observations of the Earth,\nfrom Skylab heights, will continue to\nyield more of the kind of information\nthat can be useful at ground level.\nSkylab draws on both the expertise\nand the hardware of the Apollo program.\nThe Saturn V booster will place in\norbit the workshop cluster, a structure\nconsisting of the workshop itself,\nmodified from a Saturn S-IVB stage,\nthe Apollo telescope mount, an airlock\nand a docking adapter. This cluster\xe2\x80\x94\nweighing 82,237 kilograms (181,300\npounds) and spanning 35.97 meters (118\nfeet)\xe2\x80\x94will be orbited at a height of\n435 kilometers (235 nautical miles) in a\nnearly-circular path inclined at 50\ndegrees to the Earth\'s polar axis.\nAbout a day after the launch of the\nworkshop cluster, the first manned\nflight\xe2\x80\x94Skylab 2\xe2\x80\x94will be launched.\nLifted into orbit by a Saturn lB booster,\nthe three-man crew will make the trip\nto their orbital home in a modified\nApollo command/service module.\nThey will rendezvous and dock, and enter\nthe workshop for a time period of 28\ndays to conduct the planned programs of\n\n30\n\nexperimentation.\nTheir laboratory will give them considerably more room to move around\nthan the Apollo astronauts enjoyed. The\ntotal work volume of the Skylab workshop\ncluster is 316.45 cubic meters (12,673\ncubic feet) which is about the size of a\nfour-bedroom house.\nAt the end of their 28-day stay, the\ncrew will ready the workshop for a twomonth dormant period. They will then\nenter the command/ service module,\nseparate from the cluster, and return\nto Earth.\nAfter two months, the second crew will\nmake its journey to the workshop, this time for a stay of 56 days.\nBut, having studied most of the medical\nproblems in the earlier stay, this time\nperiod will concentrate on the solar astronomy and Earth resources experiments.\nSkylab 4, the last of the planned\nprogrammed launches, will go aloft about\na month after the completion of the\nsecond mission, and will also stay in orbit\nfor 56 days. Earth resources will receive\nthe major share of the attention on\nthis trip.\nYou can see the evolution of the space\nprogram by studying the progress made\nfrom the early days of the one-man\nMercury flights. A program as daring as\nthe introduction of man into space must,\nof necessity, start at the first step. And\nso the first Mercury flights lofted\nastronauts into ballistic trajectories\nabove the Earth to check initial problems\nand reactions to manned space flight.\nStay time was increased as the orbital\ntrips were added. Two-man Gemini\nteams explored the concepts of working\ntogether to achieve longer stay times\nand to perform more useful tasks.\nThen came Apollo, with its long-term\nEarth orbits with a three-man crew.\nApollo 11, as the first lunar landing,\nproved that the trip could be made safely.\nApollo 12 proved that lunar landings\ncould be made precisely. Later Apollo\nmissions proved the usefulness of man\nas an explorer and scientist in space\nas he was on Earth.\nThen came Skylab, the logical next\nstep, with its extended stay times in space\nand the opportunity to study Earth\nover extended periods. It\'s too early to\npredict, but the Skylab work may\nprove to be the most valuable space\nexperiments ever undertaken, in terms\nof direct applications to everyday\n\nproblems on Earth.\nBeyond Skylab there are two programs\nof extreme interest. The first is the\njoint Apollo-Soyuz test program, to be\nthe first international space effort.\nAmerican astronauts, in an Apollo spacecraft, will rendezvous, dock, and visit\nan orbiting Soyuz. In turn, Soyuz crewmen will pass through the docking\nmodule and return the visit to the Apollo.\nThe target date for the launch is\nJuly 15, 1975.\nThere is a deep and serious purpose\nbehind this first planned experiment\nwith Apollo and Soyuz. The first flight\nwill test the designs, the ability to work\ntogether, and the ability to communicate and control a joint program. Later\nspacecraft of both nations will be\ndesigned so that they can rendezvous\nand dock with each other and with their\nspace stations in an extension of that\nfirst cooperative joining in space.\nFinally, the real benefits of space\nappear to be achievable only if some\neconomical means of getting to and from\norbit can be established. It is, at the\nmoment, costly to use a huge launch\nvehicle to loft one spacecraft into space\nonly to soon be discarded in a flaming\nplunge back into the Earth\'s atmosphere.\nOne answer is the space shuttle, an\nairplane-like orbiter roughly the size of a\ncontemporary twin-jet airliner. Strap-on\nsolid propellant rockets will launch\nthe shuttle initially, and its own propulsion system will take over as the\nsecond stage.\nThe spacious design of the shuttle\nwill provide an enormous amount of\nspace\xe2\x80\x94equivalent to the passenger\ncabin volume of today\'s four-engined jet\nair transports\xe2\x80\x94in which payloads can\nbe carried to and from space. Imagine\nthe convenience of carrying a complete\nscientific satellite, plus the crew to\nmaintain it, to an orbit where it can be\nparked and watched. Or the ability to\nretrieve an important satellite communication link, and replace some critical\ncomponent whose life is limited by time.\nThe shuttle, after its trip into orbit,\ncan literally fly back to Earth, making a\nconventional landing at an airstrip.\nTwo weeks later it can be ready for\nanother trip.\nThe payoff here lies in two areas:\nfirst, the convenience of the shuttle in\ngetting to and from space easily and\neconomically; second, in the economics\n\nThe space shuttle, a re-usable vehicle for travel\nfrom Earth to orbit and back again, promises to\nincrease the benefits of space research while\nlowering the costs of operations.\nof the shuttle. To take a pound of\nweight to orbit now costs about $1,000\nor more, depending on the vehicle used.\nThe shuttle costs are expected to\nreduce that figure to something less than\n$200, perhaps as little as $160 per\npound in orbit.\nTo put that into perspective, you can\norbit the Earth once, right now\xe2\x80\x94\nadmittedly at a much lower altitude and\nvia commercial airlines\xe2\x80\x94for about $10\nper pound of your weight.\nThe space shuttle economics ma\nor may not ever permit fares like tha\nBut one thing is certain: the space\nshuttle will provide the only way to m\nthe benefits of space readily and\ncheaply available. As President Richard\nNixon said early in 1972, the space\nshuttle ". . . will go a long way toward\ndelivering the rich benefits of practice:\nspace utilization and the valuable\nspinoffs from space efforts into the \'Jai.y\nlives of Americans and all people.\nSkylab will conduct space science, med\nEarth resources and other experiments\nEarth-orbiting laboratory.\n\nV\n\\.. \\\n\nApollo 17\t\n1972\n\nTime of major flight events\n\nLaunch at Kennedy Space Center\t\n\nEpilogue\n\n12:33 am., December 7\n\nSpacecraft enters lunar orbit\t\n\n2:48 p.m., December 10\n\nLunar module lands at Taurus-Littrow\t\n\n1:55 p.m., December 11\n\nLiftoff from Moon\t\n\n5:55 p.m., December 14\n\nTrans-Earth injection\t\n\n6:35 p.m., December 16\n\nSplashdown\t\n\n2:24 p.m., December 17\n\nApollo 17\t\n1972\n\nEVA on Moon\n\nStart\n\nFirst EVA\t\n\n6:55 p.m.\nDec. 11\nSecond EVA 6:17 p.m.\nDec. 12\nThird EVA\t 5:23 p.m.\nDec 13\nNote: All times Eastern Standard.\n\nDuration\n\nRocks\ncollected\n\n7 hr. 12 mm.\n\nDistance\ndriven with\nLRV\n4.4 km.

It was the manned\nspaceflight program that first gave\npeople an awareness of just how small\nand finite and limited are the resources\nof spaceship Earth.\nThe problems were defined more\nclearly and more tellingly than ever\nbefore. Manned space flights awakened\na worldwide consciousness that Earth,\nour home, was all we had to share\namong billions of people of all colors and\nall philosophies. It underlined the fragility of this tiny blue sphere, the pitifully\namounts of water and rainfall, snow\npampas, broad steppes, hillside farms\nand rice paddies.\nBut Apollo did more than define the\nproblem. It began to suggest solutions.\nWith men as trained observers in space,\npeople could watch over their own\nspaceship, could see the fouling of its\nwater and the loss of its green lands,\nand could begin to plan solutions.\nSensitive instruments, cameras, spectrometers, human eyes could see what\nneeded to be done, and send back the\ncoordinates of trouble.\nIt has been said that you can\'t begin\nto understand a problem until you can\nlook at it from a distance. The Apollo\nprogram, and the manned space flights\nthat will surely follow, place mankind\nat that needed distance so that he can\nponder solutions to his problems.\nSo it is interesting that scientists will\nbetter understand the origins of the\nMoon, and therefore, of the Earth.\nBut it is vital that man finally has seen\nhis home from the depths of space,\nand has understood, after all, how frail\nan abode it really is.\n\nEarth, the frail blue planet, as seen from the\nreturning Apollo 17.\n\nFor sale by the Superintendent of Documents,\nU.S. Government Printing Office,\nWashington, D.C. 20402 - Price $1.25\nStock Number 3300-00480\n32\t\n\nU.S. GOVERNMENT PRINTING OFFICE 1913-0-490-440\n\nI\n\nJoop\n\nI\n\nEP-102\nProduced by the Office of Public Affairs\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration\nWashington, D.C. 20546\n\n'
