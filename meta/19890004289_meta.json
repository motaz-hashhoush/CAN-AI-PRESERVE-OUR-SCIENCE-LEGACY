Even though much cyclic data is available on TBCs, high time data is much harder and expensive to come by. The typical 150 h type test used to qualify hardware, or modifications, falls far short of the 5 to 10,000 hour experience desired. One way to obtain data demonstrating the longevity of TBCs is through a service evaluation program on a commercial engine. For a meaningful evaluation of the TBC system it must be applied to a component which operates in a typical hot end environment. In addition the component performance should not suffer if the coating is lost. For these reasons Rolls-Royce chose to coat the IP turbine nozzle guide vanes, and run these in an RB211 engine. Two ceramic top coats and several different bond coats were tested in a rainbow fashion on several engines. Three layer magnesium zirconate was used as a base line. Various yttria stabilized zirconia ceramics were used. Top MCrAlY bond coats were applied by various techniques. Some of the coated vanes have now accumulated ofer 5000 hours. The results are presented from the first sets with 2500 and 4200 hours of service respectively.", "title": "High time service evaluation of thermal barrier coatings on the Rolls-Royce RB211 engine", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-05T22:45:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19890004289, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Toriz, F.
