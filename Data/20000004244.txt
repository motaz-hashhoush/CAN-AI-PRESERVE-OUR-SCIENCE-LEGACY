Dubovikov1\n^ASA, Goddard Institute for Space Studies\n2880 Broadway, New York, N.Y., 10025\n2\n\nDept. Applied Physics, Columbia Univ., New York, N.Y., 10027\n\nAbstract\nWe develop and test a 1\xe2\x80\x94point closure turbulence model with the following features.\n1) we include the salinity field and derive the expression for the vertical turbulent\ndiffusivities of momentum Kui , heat K, and salt Ks as a function of two stability\nn\nparameters: the Richardson number Ri (stratification vs. shear) and the Turner number R\n(salinity gradient vs. temperature gradient).\n2) to describe turbulent mixing below the mixed layer (ML), all previous models have\nadopted three adjustable "background diffusivities" for momentum, heat and salt We\npropose a model that avoids such adjustable diffusivities We assume that below the ML, the\nthree diffusivtties have the same functional dependence on Ri and R as derived from the\nturbulence model However, in order to compute Ri below the ML, we use data of vertical\nshear due to wave-breaking measured by Gargett et al. (1981). The procedure frees the\nmodel from adjustable background diffusivities and indeed we employ the same model\nthroughout the entire vertical extent of the ocean.\n3) in the local model, the turbulent diffusivities Kiii^n^s are given as analytical functions of\n,\nRi and R\n\n5) the model is used in an 0-GCM and several results are presented to exhibit the effect of\ndouble diffusion processes.\n6) the code is available upon request.\n\nI. Introduction\nFor sake of completeness, we recall that the 0-GCM solve the dynamic equations for\nthe mean velocity U-, mean temperature T and mean salinity S:\n\nThe velocity, temperature and salinity fields have also fluctuating components Up T" and\ns" which produce the correlations uW\n\n(Reynolds stresses), u\'.\'T"(heat fluxes) and\nJ\n\nu\'.\'s"(salinity fluxes). The challenge then is to construct such correlations so as to solve\nEqs (la-c). To fix the ideas, we further write:\n= -K\n\nE.\n\n(Id)\n\nwhere \xc2\xa3 =\xc2\xa3(U ; -+U, ;1) is the mean shear. The K , are the turbulent difjusivities for\n>\xe2\x80\xa2}\nlit\nJi\nm,n,s\nmomentum, heat and salt. As discussed in paper I, they have the general functional form.\nVh,s= 2 7 Sm,h,s\n(\'\xc2\xab\'\nwhere K and c are the turbulent kinetic energy and its rate of dissipation which in principle\nare given by two dynamic equations (the K-e model). The dimensionless structure\nfunctions Sm ),n j o must differ from one another so that:\nIn general we can write.\nS\n\nm,h,s \' Sm,h\nwhere a I and a are the volume expansion coefficients a=-p A dp/ffT and ao =p\'ldp/d^ and\nS\n1\nwhere the shear VU can be generated either by external sources like in the mixed layer ML\nor by internal wave-breaking processes below the ML. If one introduces the Turner number\n\nR and the Richardson number Ri:\n\nwhere\n\np cfz\nwe can rewrite (li) more concisely as\n\n0\n\n0\n\n~T0z\n\n~s0z\n\n\' nv~ ~~p\'\n\n^ \'\n\nS\n\nm,h,s= Sm,h,s(Rp\' *)\n(2c)\n(Clearly, we could have also defined Ri in terms of N2 rather than just the thermal\ngradient. We have chosen the latter for reasons of presentation of the results). One must\ndistinguish the following four cases:\nSF (salt fingers, salty-warm over fresh-cold):\n\nR >0,\nR <1 Stable, N 2 >0,\n\nRi>0\nR >1 Unstable, N 2 <0\n\n(2d)\n\nDC (diffusive convection, fresh-cold over salty-warm):\n\nR >0, Ri<0\nR <1 Unstable, N 2 <0,\n\nR >1 Stable, N 2 >0\n\n(2e)\n\nDS (doubly stable, fresh-warm over salty-cold]\n\nR <0, Ri>0, N2>0, Stable\n\n(2f)\n\nDU (doubly unstable, salty-cold over fresh-warm):\n\nR <0, Ri<0, N 2 <0, Unstable\n\n(2g)\n\nThe stability/instability is predicated on the Brunt-Vaisala frequency N with N 2 >0\n(stable) and N 2 <0 (unstable).\nThe general problem is to construct (2c) so as to encompass all four cases (2d-g)\n\nFirst, there is ample evidence from laboratory and oceanic field data that show that K, is\ndifferent from Kg. In the SF case, the ratio K / K h > l (Hamilton et al., 1989) while in the\nDC case, K h /K g >l (Kelley, 1984). Schmitt (1981) has also shown that the observed T-S\nrelationship is not consistent with K, =K . For a discussion and review of the importance\nn\ns\nof these processes and their extent in different parts of the ocean, see Turner (1967, 1973.\n1985), Schmitt (1994) and Zhang et al. (1998). In spite of this evidence, almost all 0-GCM\nstill assume\nK s =K h\n\n(3a)\n\nRecently, attempts have been made to overcome (3a) but the task is not easy The mam\ndifficulty is that in the absence of a model capable of encompassing all four cases, SF, DC,\nDS and DU, the only alternative is to employ laboratory and ocean data to build the\nfunctional form of the diffusivities to be used in an 0-GCM. This is the approach\nemployed by Large et al. (1994), Zhang et al. (1998, ZSH) and Merryfield et al. (1999,\nMHG) who used relations by Schmitt (1981) and Kelley (1984, 1990), among others.\nThere is, however, an internal limitation to such a procedure since the available data\nrefer to SF and DC but not to DS and DU which are also important (Duffy and Caldera,\n1999) Thus, away from the regions where SF and DC are active, the above authors take\n\nVh,s<DS- DU> =\xc2\xb0\n\n<3b>\n\nor, more precisely, they use a background diffusivity which is chosen primarily on grounds\nof numerical stability but whose physical origin must be an internal-wave breaking\nphenomenon This is clearly not a satisfactory situation especially in view of the fact that\nSince the studies by ZHS and MHG have shown the importance of double diffusion, the\nabove procedure is certainly far better than (3a) but still not fully satisfactory. The goal of\nthis paper is to consider the same problem but with a different methodology.\nWe develop a turbulence model to compute the three difjusivzties for momentum, heat\nand salt and construct the functions (Ig) and (li) for the four processes SF, DC, DS and\nDU in the presence of an arbitrary shear. The inclusion of shear is quite relevant since is\n\nknown to hamper the SF mechanism (Linden, 1971, 1974a, b; Kunze, 1990) and yet, the\nabove procedures do not account for shear since they expressed K, and K in terms of only\none stability parameter R\n\nrather than R and the Richardson number Ri\n\nWe present three models- 1) K and e are solutions of two dynamical equations (K-e\nmodel), 2) only one of them satisfies a differential equation while the other is taken to be\nthe local limit of its dynamic equation and 3) both K and c are taken as the local limit of\ntheir respective dynamic equations. As we shall show, in model 3) all the relations are\nalgebraic and one must solve a cubic equation. The numerical results correspond to 3).\nThe structure of the paper is as follows. In II-VII we derive the general non-local,\ndynamic equations for the mean fields as well as the turbulent variables. In VIII we derive\nthe analytic expressions for the turbulent diffusivities with only two non-local variables,\nthe turbulent kinetic energy K and its rate of dissipation, t In IX-X we study the case of\ndouble diffusion without shear and show that the predictions of the model are m agreement\nwith several laboratory and ocean data. In XI we give the complete analytic solution for\nthe local model: we derive the algebraic expressions for the momentum, heat and salt\ndiffusivities in the presence of arbitrary shear. In XII, we discuss the time scales. In XIII,\nwe display several solutions of the model, specifically we plot the diffusivities K\'s and their\nratios as a function of the two stability parameters, the Richardson number and the Turner\nnumber. In XIV-XVI we present the results of an 0\xe2\x80\x94GCM with the above model where we\nuse the same turbulence model below the mixed layer where the shear is no longer due to\nthe external wind forcing but to a wave breaking mechanism. In XVII we present some\nconcluding remarks.\n\nII. Continuity equation\nFollowing the formalism presented elsewhere (Canuto, 1997), the total velocity,\ndensity and pressure fields are split into mean and fluctuating parts as follows:\nP\'=P\'=0\n\n(5a)\n\nthe Reynolds average <u!>=0. The relation between the two is discussed in Canute\n(1997a). Using the equation for the density p\n\n<5C>\nwe obtain, upon mass averaging,\n\n(5d\n\n>\n\nIII. Velocity Field.

Concentration Equations\nConsider a model with two fluids of density pc and p(l-c), where c is the\nconcentration and p the total density of the fluid which satisfies (5c). The equation satisfied\nby pc is given by (no external sources)\n\nor alternatively,\n\nwhere J is the diffusion flux\nV\n(8C) \'\n\nwhere xc is the molecular diffusivity of the c-field.

Temperature field\nWe begin with the equation for the entropy S (Landau and Lifshitz 1987),\n\nwhere /t is the chemical potential and\nwhere F^ is the thermal flux. In the absence of diffusion, q.= Fr but here q depends also on\nthe gradients of the concentration as well as on the gradient of //.

Making use of the results derived in Canuto\n(1997) and recalling that a--u- . = ~pf, we obtain\n^c 8? = - (F?+FF- um^}: -\n\n(16a)\nwhere F^ is the heat flux\nF? = c />T"uV = pH.\n\n(16b)\n\nThe Uy term in (16a) can be written using the second of (5b) and (22e) below. Eq (16a) is\nthe generalized Bernoulli\'s equation with turbulence, diffusion and heat flux. When dealing\nwith incompressible ocean turbulence, one can neglect the third-order term p\'u\'.1 as being\nsmaller than the second-order terms to which is summed; the last term can also be\njustifiably neglected as a kinematic term smaller than the remaining turbulence terms; the\npTcT term can also be neglected since d=du./dx.-=Q in an incompressible flow; the term pt\ncannot in principle be neglected since it represents the energy gained by the temperature\nfield that is lost by the kinetic energy because of friction; thus, its presence is a\nconsequence of energy conservation Thus, we have:\n_\n\n\xe2\x80\x9e\xe2\x80\x9e\n\nFIT1\n\nU -I\n\nf*\n\nr\n\n/Til* I TT\'M\n\nV\\\n\n/)\n\n\xe2\x80\x94\n\ni + Hnt + u i7K7 )F + Pc\nI\n\n, ./ij\n\nI\n\n77n"t/\n\nM5\n\nJ_ nt\n\n( lbc >\n\n/ 1 Rr>\\\n\nSince D/Dt =9/5t +Ujd/dx., one can probably neglect the u? term since it summed to the\nmean flow velocity U- which is expected to be larger. This further reduces (16c) to:\n\nIn all 0\xe2\x80\x94GCM, this equation is however further reduced to:\n\nVI. Turbulence\nAs already discussed, we need to evaluate the following second-order moments (2c).\nThe equation for the first of them has already been given by Eq.(6a).

For large Peclet numbers, a K, b K and d K become constant, Appendix C. As\nbefore, the variables K and c are in principle solutions of Eqs.(38) and (39). The\n(superficial) algebraic complexity of the functions A\'s is a small price to pay when one\nconsiders that the above equations are the solution of a fully turbulent problem in the\npresence of three external fields, T, U and C. It is indeed quite surprising that such a\ncomplex problem could be expressed via a set of algebraic relations.\nIn the case of a local model, Eq.(38) becomes:\n\nUsing the definition of the K\'s and that of ^> given in Eq.(74c), we have\n4Sm-Ri(l-R^(Sh-RpSs)] = |j\nOnce we substitute the functions S\n\nh\n\n(77b)\n\n, Eq (77c) yields the function:\n\nIll^IlyU\n\nR)\n\n(78a)\n\nWe recall that in the functions A^ . 0 we must substitute:\nm,n,s\nl-iy-1\n\n(78b)\n\nc = ^RiR^l-Rp-1\n\n(78c)\n\nWe shall exhibit the turbulent diffusivities K in .

The RNG method to determine the time scales r , r^ TC> T p TQ\nTo make the above equations predictive, one must know the dissipation time scales of\n27\n\nthe different turbulent variables, namely T , T \xc2\xab, r , r \xc2\xab, r\xc2\xab. Not surprisingly, this is one\nof the most difficult problems since one-point closure models, like the one we have used,\nare unable to provide them. In most engineering and geophysical applications (e.g., the MY\nmodel), it was always assumed that\n*K = (V Tc0\' V V r $ rl ~ constant\nHowever, on physical grounds, it is only possible to say that\n\nT\n\n(79a)\n\nr r\n\nPr v\n\n(79b)\n\n^c\n\nwhile T a remains to be determined. Since in principle, one may want to consider regimes\nin which the Peclet number of both the temperature and salinity fields are not excessively\nlager than unity (Pe~l correspond to low levels of turbulence), we adopt expressions for\nthat were previously depermined: theye are\n\nSafl+a; 1 )- 1\n\n(79c)\n\n=4\n\n47^=1,\n\n(79d)\n\nt ^/a tc )\n\n(79e)\n\nWe have used only one symbol for both Pe and a, but clearly in each specific case one must\nTP\n\ninsert the corresponding Pe and <r, where:\n\nwhere Xar are the molecular diffusivities of the two fields.

Numerical Results\nIn Figs.1-3 we plot K ro^n^o vs. Ri (defined in Eq.78d) for different R p (defined in\n,\nEq.2a). The panels are characterized by the symbols SF (salt fingers), DC (diffusive\nconvection), DS (doubly stable) and DU (doubly unstable) defined in Eqs (2d-g). Consider\nthe case of salt-fingers in Fig.la. At a fixed Ri, the diffusivity increases as R increases\nwhich is physically understandable since the instability is generated by salt and thus the\nlarger the source, the larger the diffusivity. Next, consider the dependence on Ri. We notice\nthat the smaller the shear Ri-\xc2\xbbo>, the larger are the K\'s, which at first may seem\nparadoxical: since both salt and shear contribute to the instability, their effect should add\nup What we find is that the larger the shear, the smaller the diffusivity, which implies\nthat shear and salt-fingers work in opposite directions. It is in fact known (Linden 1971,\n1974b, Kunze, 1990) that shear has the tendency to disrupt the fingers transport process In\nthe case of DS and DU, Fig.lb, R is negative, see Eqs.(2f-g). Quite understandably, the\nformer case (right panel) corresponds to the lowest diffusivity because of the large stability\nintroduced by both salt and temperature. The only source of instability is shear and thus\nturbulent mixing dies when stratification is too strong. In the DU sade, the opposite occurs\nin the sense that both T and S are unstable and the resulting diffusivities are the largest.\nThe same considerations hold true for K, and Ks which are shown in Figs.2,3. Consider\nn\nnow the DC case, Fig.la. At a given Ri, the diffusivity decreases as R increases, the\nopposite of the SF case. This is in accordance with the fact that in this case salt acts as a\nsink of turbulent mixing (which is caused by an unstable temperature gradient), and thus,\nthe stronger the sink, the lower the level of turbulence, a circumstance that is reflected in\nthe decrease of the diffusivity. As for the effect of shear, we notice that here too, the\nsmaller the shear (large Ri), the larger the diffusivities which implies that shear prevents\nthe mixing caused by the temperature instability. However, this is not true in general, the\n29\n\ncurves first decrease with increasing Ri, which indicates that for moderate Ri shear helps\nmixing, as one would expect, but the trend does not continue since the curves change\ncurvature. However, there is saturation phenomenon which does not occur in the SF case\nAt large R (large sink), the help in mixing from shear saturates. Finally, the lowest three\ncurves correspond to a stable situation, while the second and third correspond to an\nunstable situation. In Figs. 2b and 3b we present K, and K in the DU (doubly unstable)\nand DS (doubly stable) cases. Quite naturally, in the altter case the diffusivities are the\nlowest. In Figs.4-6 we plot the ratios K m / K n, K m/K s and K, /K o which show quite\n,\nn\nclearly that the diffusivities are indeed different among themselves. In Figs. 7-10 we exhibit\nthe turbulent mass diffusivity K\n\np\n\ndefined in Eq (59e) and given in terms of K,\n\n"\xc2\xbb"\n\nby\n\nEq(60). In Fig 11 we plot T defined in Eq.(59f). Schmitt (1994) "measured" values of\nT=0 18-0.25 are indeed predicted by the model for the case of salt fingers (upper right\npanel) for quite a range of Ri but the precise value depends on R .\nThe length scale A is determined using the Deardorff\xe2\x80\x94 Blackadar formula:\nA = 2-3/2B I,\n\nB =24.7,\ni\n)\n\n(80a)\n\nI = nzi v H-Kz)- 1 ,\n(i\nt = 0.17H\n(80b)\ni\no o\no\nwhere iq 2 =K is the turbulent kinetic energy, N is the Brunt-Vaisala frequency, \xc2\xab=0 4 is\nthe von Karman constant and H is the mixed layer depth. When used within the NCAR\nCSM Ocean Model, H is determined as the depth where the buoyancy difference\ng[/9(H)- /9(surface)]p(H)-1 = 3 lO^ms\'2\n\n(80c)\n\nXIV. Ocean GCM\nWe tested the new vertical diffusivities in a global ocean general circulation model,\nthe NCAR CSM Ocean Model produced by the University Corporation for Research,\nNational Center for Atmospheric Research, Climate and Global Dynamics Division. They\ndeveloped their model by modifying the MOM 1.1 GFDL code (NCAR CSM Ocean Model\n30\n\nTechnical Note, The NCAR CSM Ocean Model, by the NCAR Oceanography section). We\nemployed the stand-alone 3\xc2\xb0x3\xc2\xb0 configuration of the model detailed in their technical note\nwith the default parameter values. It has 3.6\xc2\xb0 spacing in longitude and a variable spacing in\nlatitude increasing from 1.8\xc2\xb0 at the equator to 3.4\xc2\xb0 at 17\xc2\xb0 N, S and then decreasing back to\n1.8\xc2\xb0 for 60\xc2\xb0 N, S and poleward. There are 25 levels of increasing thickness in the vertical,\nwith the surface level 6 meters thick\n\nThe option for the GM mesoscale eddy\n\nparameterization was enabled. Bulk forcing with a seasonal cycle plus a 1/2 year timescale\nrestoring condition on the salinity is used, except under sea-ice where there is strong\nrestoring. This configuration corresponds to the case B-K described in Large et al (1997).\nIt should be noted, however, that for determination of the length scale in our turbulence\nmodel we used the program\'s definition for mixed layer depth (a buoyancy difference from\nthe surface of 3 10\'4ms\'2), which is different from that graphed as a diagnostic in Fig.5 of\nLarge et al.(1997) We initialized our runs with annually averaged Levitus data and ran for\n126 momentum years. As in Large et al. (1997) a 3504sec timestep for momentum is used,\nwhile for the first 96 momentum years the tracers are accelerated by a factor increasing\nfrom 10 at the surface to 100 for the deep ocean. We then set all timesteps equal for the\nremaining 30 years as they did.\nFirst, we ran the NCAR program as is, with the option for the KPP mixing enabled,\nproducing the KPP data presented in the figures below. Then, in place of the KPP module,\nwe inserted a module which uses our new model for the diffusivities for momentum and\nheat with the salt diffusivity set equal to that of heat. To save computing time, we\nconstructed tables of the dimensionless functions S111*11 and of the dimensionless variable y\n,\n(obtained from solving Eq.68e),\ny = * $\xc2\xa3?\n\nE ix a ( \xc2\xa3)2\n\n(81a)\n\nvs. Ri. Then, for each point in space and time these were interpolated to the local Ri. The\ndiffusivities K111*li were written in terms of (81a) as\n,\n\n31\n\n111)\n\n.11\n\nMBv-*S m h\n\\\n\n1 11\n1 , 1\n\n(81b)\n\nXV. Below the Mixed Layer\nBelow the ocean mixed layer, the external wind-generated shear is too small to\ngenerate turbulent mixing and yet, even in regions where both the temperature and the\nsalinity gradients are stably stratified, it is usual to assume "background diffusivities" for\nviscosity, heat and salt diffusivity which are believed to be caused by internal wave\nbreaking (Large et al., 1997). In our case, when we assumed K^=K , we followed the same\npractice. It would be preferable not to do so but rather model the physical processes\ncausing this background mixing. Our main assumption is that the turbulence model has\ngiven us the correct functional dependence of the Km,n,s on Ri and Rp and that such\n,\ndiffusivities can thus be used below the ML. Since all the arguments discussed below, are\nvalid for any of the three K\'s, we shall use only the generic symbol K and write succinctly\nK = K(Ri,R )\n\n(82a)\n\nThe key problem is how to define and thus compute Ri. Here, we shall make us of the\nmeasured data (Gargett et al., 1981) on the vertical shear generated by the wave breaking\nphenomenon. By integrating over all wavenumbers one can compute the shear due to\ninternal waves, S , . One can then form a corresponding Ri , as follows:\nRi\n\nwb= N2 /S wb\n\n(82b)\n\nN2 = - g/r1-^\n\n(82c)\n\nwhere\n\nGargett et. al. (1981, sec. 5) confirmed earlier arguments by Munk (1966) that Ri , ~1 To\nthose argument, we would like to add the following consideration. As the value of Ri ,\nabove which there is no longer turbulent mixing, computed from our model is 0(1), if Ri ,\nwere \xc2\xbb1,\n\nthere would be no turbulence generated by the internal waves at all. On the\n\nother hand if Ri , were \xc2\xab1,\n\nthere would be a very strong turbulence producing a\n\nviscosity sufficient to damp out the waves themselves. The wave-generated turbulence is\nthus self-limiting Since the turbulence model gives a precise value for Ricr, while the\n32\n\nabove argument only tells us that Ri u~0(l), we shall write:\nRiwb=cRicr\n\n(82d)\n\nwhere c is a constant reasonably close to unity. We have found that c=0.88 gives a\ndiffusivity close that measured by Ledwell et al. (1993). Since in the local model, the K\'s\nare also proportional to the length scale A or i. Below the mixed layer, we thus need an\nanalogous i^.\n\nWe shall use the same formal expressions (80a,b) but with different t (wb)\n\nwhich we compute as follows. Assuming a Kolmogorov spectrum at wavenumbers upward\nof a breakpoint k and integrating, we obtain:\n/ (wb) = (3Ko) 3 / 2 (B k )-\'\n\n(82e)\n\nwhere Ko=1.6 is the Kolmogorov constant. We identify k with the best value of Gargett\net al. (1981) for the break in slope of the observed spectrum of internal waves, namely\nk = y0 2 TT radians/meter\n\n(82f)\n\nThus, ^ 0 (wb) is known and so is t , . Similarly, y , is obtained by solving the\nproduction=dissipation, Eq (77b). Thus, the complete wave\xe2\x80\x94breaking expressions for the\nthree diffusivities are:\nK\n\n(82g)\nm,h,s< wb > = **f(*W*?d Sm,h,s(Riwb\' V\nWe add together the diffusivities calculated using the shear resolved in the ocean model\n\nand the background diffusivities, ensuring continuity in the transition between regions\nwhere external excited shear dominates and those where the internal wave shear does We\nthus take the total diffusivities to be:\nK\n\nm,h,s = K m,h,s< Ri \'V + Km,h,s(\xc2\xbbb\' V\n< 82h >\nIn the statically unstable case (Ri< 0), we set Km^n^o (wb)=0. The very large mixing due\n,\nto convective instability makes the background irrelevant in this situation in any case.\n\nXVI. 0-GCM results\nUsing the model for the K\'s extended all the way to the bottom of the ocean, we\nobtain the results presented in Figs. 12-23. In each case, we compare the results with\n33\n\nLevitus (1994) data, with the KPP model ( Kn = K s ) for which we have rerun the code and\n,\nwith our model with K s= K ,XI In Figs. 24-32 we plot K m,li s,^/ (cmV1) vs. depth (meters)\n.\n,\n5\n\nat different locations. As expected, the K\'s are small below the mixed layer where they can\nreach very high values, as we explicitly show in Figs.30-32. In case of the Canary Islands,\nFig.29, the diffusivity of a truly passive scalar (and thus strictly not K m,n,s,/? ) was\n,\nmeasured by Ledwell et al. (1993) to have a value of 0.11\xc2\xb10.02 cmV1. Finally, in Fig.33 we\npresent the polar heat transport. As already discussed in the work of MHG, global\nproperties are not strongly affected by double diffusion phenomena.\n\nXVII. Conclusions.\nConsidering the importance of double diffusion phenomena in oceanography (Schmitt.\n1994, Zhang et al., 1998; Merrifield et al., 1999), we believe we have made a quantitative\nstep by presenting a new formalism. The resiliency of the new approach is demonstrated by\nthe fact that it can encompass salt-fingers, diffusive-convection, doubly stable and doubly\nunstable gradients The whole formalism was developed so as to include shear which,\nthough of different origin at differernt depths, is always present. Within the mixed layer, it\nis mainly due to external wind gradients while in the ocean interior is believed to be mainly\ndue to wave breaking phenomena.\nClearly, the model with salinity would have lost much of its attractiveness if we could\nuse it only in the ML and if we had to parameterize the physical processes below the ML\nwith adjustable background diffusivities as done thus far. We have suggested that below\nthe ML the functional dependence of the three diffusivities on the two stability parameters\nR and Ri is still the one given by the turbulence model since the latter does not depend on\nany specific form of the shear entering the Richardson number Ri. As dicvussed in XIV, we\nhave used the data on vertical shear measured by Gargett et al. (1981).\nThe final model comes in more than one flavor depending on whether on uses local or\nnon-local models. Logically, the first model we have treid is the local one since the whole\n34\n\nproblem can be solved analytically. The expressions for the turbulent diffusivities are\nalgebraic. The whole turbulence problem is reduced to the solution of a cubic equation\nThe problem is however far from solved. Of particular significance is the role played\nby the salinity\xe2\x80\x94temperature correlation. If we were to assume that\n\nTV = (T^s112)*\n\n(83a)\n\nand that\nT c ff= \\ T = \xc2\xb1 T 9\n\n(83b)\n\nas one may be tempted to do, one would obtain that the two fields are indistinguishable\nand this implies that\nK s =K h\n\n(83c)\n\ncontrary to what is observed. Fortunately, the present model dos not require either of\nEqs (83a,b) but once they are imposed, (83c) follows. These and similar questions will be\nthe subject of future studies.\n\n35\n\nFigure caption\n\nFig. la Momentum diffusivity K\n\nin units of A 2 Nu, see Eqs.(74c) and (58b) vs. Ri defined\n\nin Eq.(78d) for different values of the Turner number R defined in Eq.(2a).
