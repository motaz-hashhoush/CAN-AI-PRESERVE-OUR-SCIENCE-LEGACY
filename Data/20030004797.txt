b"Leak Detector\nIn the photo, a technician\nis demonstrating\nuse of a\nportable device capable of detecting radioactive\nleakage. If there were a leak, the radioactivity\nwould\nilluminate the unit's viewing screen and identify the\nsource of the leak; in the absence of radioactivity,\nthe screen shows nothing. Built by Ni-Tec., Inc.,\nNiles, Illinois, the device is in use as a radiation\ndetector at Argonne National Laboratories,\nthe government nuclear research facility in Argonne, Illinois.\nThe Ni-Tec unit is a modified version of the LIXIscope, a small, battery-powered,\nportable x-ray\ninstrument\ndeveloped\nby Goddard\nSpace\nFlight Center. Adapted from a technique_ for study-\n\ning x-ray sources in space, the LIXIscope employs a\nsmall amount of radioactive\nmaterial to produce the\nx-ray image; the radioactive\nsource is not needed\nin the Ni-Tec radiation detector.\nNi-Tec is one of\nseveral companies\nlicensed by NASA to market the\nLIXIscope, which has high potential for use in\nmedicine, dentistry and industrial operations.\nBroad\napplication\nof the system hinges on government\napproval for general use of an instrument\ncontaining\nradioactive\nmaterial.\n\n99\n\n"
