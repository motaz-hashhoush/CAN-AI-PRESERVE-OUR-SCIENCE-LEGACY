The distribution of the inner rings and satellites of all four giant planets reduced to a uniform scale of 'planetary units', normalized by the equatorial radius of each planet, is summarized. Only major ring subunits are indicated, with the density of cross-hatching representing in a crude way the relative optical depths of the different components of each system. One result of the spacecraft observations has been the discovery at each planet of several small (10-100 km in radius) satellites that appear to be intimately related to the rings, dynamically and possibly genetically as well.", "title": "Planetary rings", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-14T21:25:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19910062306, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Nicholson, Philip D."}, "organization": {"name": "Cornell University", "location": "Ithaca, NY, United States"}}, "id": "225b9b88f15147c4b4305c70bd364968"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19910062306, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Dones, Luke"}, "organization": {"name": "Canadian Institute for Theoretical Astrophysics", "location": "Toronto, Canada"}}, "id": "bf9be01c74484c62987a28ca1b971940"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Reprint (Version printed in journal)", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-18T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19910062306, "publications": [{"volume": "29", "submissionId": 19910062306, "issn": "8755-1209", "id": "5ad81136c1a947e7ac5e74ba73cfd48d", "publicationName": "Reviews of Geophysics Supplement", "publicationDate": "1991-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
