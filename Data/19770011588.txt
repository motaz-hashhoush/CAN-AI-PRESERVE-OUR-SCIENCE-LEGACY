Action programs are required for remedying accumulated abuses and mismanagements; for preserving and conserving\nthe environmental resource qualities remaining. Effective programs can\nonly be formulated by a broad community of scientific disciplines and by\nthe energies and actions of many public and private institutions. A prerequisite to the formulation and acceptance of any effective action program is the ready availability of accurate and timely information for the\nformulation of policies which can be quickly translated into combinations\nof short term and long range remedial and preventative programs. Remote\nsensing is now becoming recognized and acknowledged as a major technological means for providing this kind of information. This Project has been\nplaying a major role in bringing this change about in Michigan.\nThe primary objective of the Project is to work with agencies at all\nlevels of government in Michigan, as well as with private organizations, to\ndevelope a wide diversity of applications of remote sensing for improving\nland/resource use decisions and actions. To realize this objective, Project\nactivities are aimed at improving, across the board, the process of analyzing and allocating land and resource use in Michigan and eventually developing a responsible and self-supporting community of users of remote sensing in the state. To accomplish these aims Project staff conduct demonstration applications of remote sensing, provide user services, and participate in educational activities.\nThe following presentation describes in summary fashion the principal activities engaged during the June 1, 1976 to November 30, 1976 portion\nof the grant year. For rep- r tang purposes, the activities were grouped\nunder three broad headings: (A) application activities, (R) service activities, and (C) cot,tract activities.\n\n.J\n\n4\n\nI\t\n\nA.\t\n\nA P P L I C A T I O N A C T I V I T I E S\nThis section reports on applications of remote sensing to selected natural\n\nresource situations and problems for which base data could be quickly located,\nidentified and evaluated using remote sensing technology. The problems selected\nwere ones for which program implementation and/or improvements in the quality\nand effectiveness of on-land actions could occur.\nSome of these applications initially demanded considerable Project input.\nWhen rendered operational, these were gradually transferred to appropriate\nagencies for continuation or development to more advanced stages which would\nlead to subsequent actions. Others are expected to return to command Project\nattention from time to time when new information might be determinable or when\nadditional decisions will need to be made regarding on-Land applications.\n\n11\n\n5\n\nAl. Inventory of Potential Mosg^iito breeding Sites for Vector Control\nVector Control Section\nParks and Recreation Department\nCity of Lansing\n\n431-A City }tall\nLansing, Michigan 48933\nMosquitoes have always been a nuisance during late spring and summer\nin Michigan. The outbreak of St. Louis Encephalitis in 1975 transformed\nthe nuisance into a potentially major health hazard as this strain of\nencephalitis virus, transmitted by mosquitoes, is potentially fatal (92\ncases and 2 deaths in Michigan; 600 cases and 39 deaths in Illinois). In\nresponse to this threat, the Michigan Department of Public Health developed\nan encephalitis surveillance program in 1976 to detect evidence of virus\nactivity. A major objective of the surveillance program was to identify\nand map the location of mosquito breeding sites in the target area. This\nobjective will be given clearer focus if Michigan Senate Bill 1116, the\nMosquito Control Act, which is now under consideration by the state legislature, achieves passage. The Act will provi;le for the establishment of\nmosquito abatement districts and allocate funding for mapping activities\nto be undertaken.\nThe Vector Control Section of the City of Lansing was established in\n1959 by the Center for Disease Control, U.S. Department of Health. This\nunit deploys several field teams each year to treat standing water and\nwetland areas with appropriate compounds for mosquito larvae extermination. Effective eradication, however, is crucially dependent on a comprehensive inventory of breeding sites. A sample aerial survey, conducted\nin the spring of 1975 indicated that the field maps used by the Lansing\ntreatment teams only indicated 50 percent of the number of potential\nbreeding sites in a six square-mile area. Non-treatment of this number\nof potential sites seriously jeopardizes the overall eradication effort.\nA comprehensive inventory of all standing water (as small as puddle\nsize) and wetlands in the Lansing/East Lansing area (90 square miles) was\nundertaken by the Michigan State University Remote Sensing Project (RSP)\nduring 1976. Using a motorized Hasselblad camera, 70 mm color trans-\n\nparencies were acquired for the area at a scale of 1:18,000. Coverage\nwas obtained from a small plane during the spring when water levels were\nat their highest. The photography was systematically interpreted using\na zoom stereoscope (24X magnification). Delineations were made on clear\nacetate jackets and then transferred to a specially prepared series of\nsquare mile (section) mylar base maps. A total of 90 maps were prepared\nat a scale of 1:6,700 and sequenced to facilitate easy field use. Reduced scale paper copies of the original maps were produced to an 8^ X\n11" format and these copies, protected in acetate jackets, were included\nin a three ring binder to be used as the primary reference document for\nthe field treatment crews. A wall sized inventory map showing the standing water/wetland distribution for the whole Lansing/East Lansing area\nwas also prepared.\nThe standing water/wetland inventory identified 2,078 potential\ntreatment sites consisting of 476 standing water bodies, 1,222 wetlands\nand 380 drains or river segments. A sample evaluation of this data in\na particularly wet test area (11 square miles) revealed that the field\nteams were treating only 19 percent of the existing sites: 40 as compared\nwith 211. It is unlikely that this figure can be extrapolated to the whole\narea but it does show that the inventory provides significantly improved\ninformation.\nAt the beginning of eradication activities in 1977 specific treatment information pertaining to individual sites will he indicated on the\nfield maps including sequence of treatment within square mile sections,\npermanency of water, access points, obstacles to treatment and type of\ntreatment. These maps will then he used in the systematic treatment of\nmosquito breeding sites throughout the year.\nVector Control activities in Michigan are extremely limited and the\nLansing program is viewed as a prototype for future developments in the\nstate. The standing water/wetland inventory has documented a procedure\nto generate, in a cost effective manner, information essential for an\nadequate eradication program and as such is demanding much attention from\nother government units with mosquito control problems.\n\n7\n\nA2. Estimation of Biomass for an Old Field Ecos y stem Used in Waste\nWater !e cI1nT,\nInstitute of Water Research\nMichigan State University\nEast Lansing, Michigan 48824\nColor-infrared photography was used to evaluate the plant biomass of\na group of experimental plots in an old-field ecosystem that were being\ntreated with different levels of waste water from a sewage treatment\nfacility. Vegetation samples were collected at two to four week intervals to give field estimates of bi ,\n\nis3 and a complete harvest was collec-\n\nted on June 15 and September 2, 1976. The plots were photographed from\na light plane on four different occasions, concurrent with sample and harvest dates. Two Cibachrome prints (8"x10"), at a scale of approximately\n1:1,600, were produced from a selected 35 mm color-infrared slide of each\nflight.\nI\t\n\nThe photographs showed distinct tonal differences between treatment\nand control plots and the tonal appearance ranged from reddish-purple to\npinkish-red, depending on the density of the plant community and month\nof photography. To analyse this density pattern a five-level tonal density scale was established for each photo set and "standard" tonal chips\nwere prepared from one of the prints. Using this scale and a transparent\nmulti-cell grid, registered to ground panels shown on the photographs, a\nseries of tonal density values were recorded for each plot. A mean tonal\nvalue of each photo plot was subsequently obtained for each photograph.\nCorrelation analysis between mean tonal density and harvest biomass gave\nconsistently high coefficients ranging from 0.680 to 0.896 at the 0.001\nsignificance level. however, correlations of mean tonal density values\nand sample biomass data were low and not significant, as was the case\nbetween sample biomass data and harvest biomass data. Correlations with\nwet weight. biomass data were better than dry weight biomass data. Multiple\nregression analysis using the number of each of the five tonal values\ninterpreted in each plot as the independent variables against biomass,\nyielded higher regression coefficients, but estimates of some values were\n\nr\t\nI^\n1\n\n8\n\nquite variable. However,the multiple regression analytical technique\nis statistically valid as the tonal density levels are ordinal data.\nThe use of the mean of ordinal data in the simple regression analysis\nis statistically invalid. The multiple regression technique overcomes\nthis limitation. A review of remote sensing literature indicated that\nthis analytical technique has not been much used in such studies before.\nTLe results of this study indicate that low altitude 35 mm photography, taken as early as one month before harvest, can he used to\nestimate the total biomass of an old field ecosystem. If old field\necosystems become a standard way of utilizing waste water, the method\ndescribed may he both technically feasible and -ost effective in monitoring the vegetative response to waste water utilization. Further work\nIs needed in relating filtration rates and nutrition recovery to photo\ntonal values but the positive results of the project indicate a real\npotential of using photographs in the management of waste water irrigation projects.\n\n9\n\n-ricultural-Use Valuation\nA3. A p\nEaton County Equalization Dept. \t\n127 V. Harris Street\t\n\'harlotte, Michigan 48813\t\n\nAgricultural Experiment Station\nMichigan State University\nEast Lansing, Michigan 48824\n\nThe Michigan State Tax Commission developed in 1970 a prod .tire of\nagricultural land value assessment based on the natural soil productivity\nand current land use. This procedure has been widely adopted throughout\nMichigan.\nThe Crops and Soil Science Department at MSU, in collaboration with\nthe Remote Sensing Project (RSP) and the West Michigan Regional Planning\nCommission, has been developing an agricultural land value model using\ncomputer-based natural resource data. This model is basically the procedure outlined by the State Tax Comnise.oi, but adapted to conform with\nthe resource data structure of grid-based information systems. The RSP\nhas taken the prototype: model developed in a test site in Kent County,\nMichigan, and incorporated the model into the Resource Analysis Program\n(RAP) .\nThe RSP is currently working cooperatively with the Eaton County\nEqualization Office in developing and refining the land value model.\nThis Agency enjoys a state-wide reputation for innovation and progressiveness. It is anticipated that successful application of the computerbased technique in Eaton County will stimulate other areas to follow\nsuit.\nThis application involves the use of a Natural Resource Information\nSystem (NRIS) for both the soils data and the land use (remote sensing)\ndata. The RSP has recently completed a land cover/use map for Eaton\nCounty, which will serve as the remote sensing data \' , ase. In addition,\na detailed soil map has also been recently completed for the County.\nThe remote sensing data determines whether a parcel of land is in\nactive crop land or orchards. Only these land uses can he assessed with\nthe technique. The soil data determines a relative productivity index\n(ranging from 1 to 100), based on crop yield. The model is calibrated\nby entering 1-nown values of land recently sold in the study area (this\n\n..\n\n10\n\napproach is known as the Market Value comparison).\nThe estimated market value for each unit of land (either 10 or\n.5 acres) is displayed on a map for each section of the study area.\nThis graphic display permits an easier access and interpretation of\nthe data. In addition to market value, the maps also show current\nland use and soil type.\nThis application is significant from several aspects. First, the\napplication demonstrates the use of resource data (some of which is\nobtained through remote sensing) for land value assessment. Second,\nif the application is adopted by the host agency, then the need for\naccurate, current land cover/use data (from remote sensing) will be\ninstituted for this area. Third, this application provides exposure to\na local level agency to the usefulness and benefits of the technology\nsurrounding remote sensing.\n\n,^\n\nA4. Preservation of the Grand Mere Dune Environment\nGrand Mere Association\nBox 140\nStevensville, Michigan 49127\nThe Grand Mere area, located along the southeast shore of Lake\nMichigan in Berrien County, and consisting of streams, hogs, lakes,\nwooded upland., open beaches and dunes, represents one of Michigan\'s few\nremaining unique dune environments. The Grand Mere Association is a group\nof people who have expressed concerns relative to the impact of man on the\nGrand Mere area in terms of land use changes of parts of the area or adjacent buffer zones and the impact of intensive recreational activities.\nIn the Full of 1975, assistance from the MSU Remote Sensing Project\nwas requested for deriving crucial information from remote sensing data as\na sound basis for the development of appropriate planning guidelines and\nmanagement programs.\nSpecific proW.,:m areas as perceived by the Grand Mere. Association\nwere idc.,:cified:\n1.\n\nInvasion of Off-Road-Vehicles (ORV) and subsequent erosion and\n\ndamage to the vegetation cover of shorelines and dunes on state-owned and\nprivate properties.\n2.\n\nPotential impact of rezoning and commercial development of\n\nFederal Highway Interchange bordering the Grand Mere area.\n3.\n\nRecommendations for Nat e Trail development on state-owned land.\n\n4.\n\nMaintenance of specific cosystems to protect unir, , ie and endan-\n\ngered species (orchids, hop tree, etc.).\n5.\n\nExisting or potential proliferation of sandmining on adjacent\n\nproperties to the Grand Mere State Park.\nThe initial MSU Remote Sensing Project involvement focussed on the\noff-road-vehicle impact. Up to date, 70 mm color aerial coverage was\nacquired in October, 1976 by Project staff at a scale of 1:14,000. On\nthe images specific sample areas were selected, according to previously\ndefine , criteria, allowing for a time comparative analysis over the tLme\nperi.)d 1970-1976. For the previous years, B/W shoreline photography from\n\n1\n\n12\n\nthe Michigan Department of Natural Resources was used with an approximate\nscale of 1:5,000.\nThe vegetative cover for these sample areas was delineated and the\npercent vegetative cover was calculated using a standard dot grid. Based\non these figures, a linear regression between the vegetation cover and\ntime variable was completed for the two sample areas. Sample area #1, with\nthe lowest access potential for ORV use, shows an average vegetation loss\nof 1.901% per year, while the loss for sample area #2 amounts to 5.889%\nper year.\nExtrapolation of this recession rate justifies, therefore, the prediction that if no access limiting; measures will be taken, complete vegeta\xe2\x80\xa2\ntion loss will occur in a relatively short period; for example, area #1\n(=14.4 hectares) in 33.5 years or sample area #2 (\xc2\xb116.8 hectares) in 8.3\nyears.\nRelative recession ratios for the sample areas in specific years\nwere also calculated. Clearly visible was the influence of the energy\ncrisis on the ORV use during the period 1973-1974, when gasoline prices\nwent up and gasoline became a scarce ccmmodity for some time.\nBased on these quantifications, it is now possible for the Grand\nMere Association to present figures relative to the ORV impact to all\nadministrative units im ^lved, and to prevent further deterioration of\nthis unique environment.\nFurther cooperation relative to the previously outlined problem\nareas will continue in 1977 between the Grand Mere Association and the\nMSU Remote Sensing Project.\n\n)F 211E\nIS POOR\n\n13\nB.\t\n\nS E R V I C E A C T I V I T I E S\nProject personnel routinely provide consultation on the use of imagery,\n\neducational activities not a part of oti,er user applications, and support\nmaterials to foster additional remote sensing applications by new prospective\nusers.\nThe MSU Project team has acted as a service bureau for an increasing\nnumber of potential users. To facilitate this function, Project staff have\nprovided general. technical assistance, NASA-produced imagery and training in\nthe use of equipment to a broad range of user agencies.\nThe type and amount of assitance provided varied among agencies, but\nhas basically included the following activities:\n(1)\n\nProblem identification;\n\n(2)\n\nData source identification;\n\n(3)\n\nData classification procedures;\n\n(4)\n\nIdentification of decisions that need to be made (policy and action\nchoices);\n\n(5)\n\nDetermining data efficiencies to get at the policy and action clicices;\n\n(6)\n\nAssistance in reviewing available imagery;\n\n(7)\n\nAssistance in acquiring available imagery and equipment;\n\n(8)\n\nImagery interpretation training;\n\n(9)\n\nMerging remotely-sensed data with other natural resource information.\n\nIt is expected that the major benefit to be derived from these service\nbureau activities is the preliminary education of agencies and individuals to\nthe potential of remote sensing for day-to-day or periodic needs. At an\nappropriate stage in each agency\'s program, remote sensing may be the most\neconomical tool to accomplish program objectives.\nThe following activities relative to the 208 Program are a clear example\nof this :- 7 .cuation in that the Program mandates participating regional agencies\nto produce a land cover/use inventory which realistically has to be accomplished using remotely sensed data. Clarification of the data sources, classification scheme, and mapping options available constructively contributes to\nagency decision making.\nFurthermore, comparative analysis can be accomplished b y effectively\nmerging remotely-sensed land cover/use data with other natural resource information using an integrated, computer-based information system. This provides\n\n14\na powerful tool for regional. analysis and the development of appropriate\nland/resource use decisions and subsequent on-land actions. Such a system\nis currently under development at MSU and is reported in sections B2 and\nB3.\n\ni\n\n15\n\nB1. Merging Land Cover/Use Data from LANDSAT, Aerial Photograpny, and\nMap Sources\nCurrent and accurate land cover/use information is a basic component\nof natural resource analyses and the land planning process. In fact, its\nacquisition is often mandated by new legislation and governmental programs,\ne.g. Section 208 of t e Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of\n1972. Recently, many regional planning agencies in Michigan (under\nSection 208 funding) have acquired land cover/use information through\neither computer-assisted categorization of LANDSAT data or manual interpretation of aerial photography. Concurrently, there is an increasing\ndemand for interfacing the remotely-sensed inventory data with existing\ngeocoded information storage, analysis, and retrieval systems.\nBoth photographic and satellite data sources have .idvantages and\nlimitations with repsect to providing all data elements in an accurate\ncost-effective manner. LANDSAT data processing is a least-cost method\nof producing general land cover maps and tabular data for large areas.\nPlanning studies, however, often require more detailed land cover/use\ninformation at a accuracy level that is difficult to provide consistently\nover a range of categories through the LANDSAT data extractive process.\nAgencies in Michigan are also using grid-based conversion for LANDSAT\ndata. Manual interpretation of aerial photography is a more expensive\nand time-consuming process than digital multispectral processing, but\nit yields the more detailed categorization of land cover/uses that many\nplanning activities require. Many of these categories appear to I\nunobtainable by LANDSAT.\nThere is a need, therefore, to establish an apporpriate combination\nof procedures that maximize the effective use of both data sources in the\nprovision of an integrated information system for regional analyses. Such\na procedure is currently being investigated and developed at Michigan State\nUniversity (MSU).\nThe overall objective of the program described is to provide a gridbased lard cover/use data file that is responsive to the specific needs of\nregional planning agencies by utilizing a cost-effective combination of\n\n16\n\nof data capture procedures. This is accomplished through the blending\nof interpreted results achieved by computer-assisted categorization of\nLANDSAT data and manual interpretation of aerial photography and maps.\nSpecific tasks accomplished in producing the merged land cover/\xc2\xabse\ndata file and subsequent output products are identified in figure 1.\nThe tasks are divided into two parts: those tasks on the right side of\nthe flDw diagram are primarily concerned with the interpretation and\ngeocoding of data from photography and maps, and subsequent data analysis\nand output; those on the left side are associated with the computer\nprocessing of LANDSAT data and the production of the final color-coded\nmaps.\nEffective implementation of the merging method is crucially dependent upon selecting the "best" data source for each user-specified\ncategory in terms of accuracy and time/cost trade-offs. A test of an\nimplementation procedure is currently underway that has the following\nthree objectives:\n1. determine which categoric- can be consistently identified\nthrough routine LANDSAT data categorization procedures at an adequate\nlevel of accuracy (85 to 90 percent);\n2. determine appropriate alternative data capture procedures employing aerial photography and maps for those categories that LANDSAT\ncannot accurately identify;\n3. evaluate the accuracy and time/cost associated with operationally\napplying the integrated inventory procedure with reference to inventories\ndeveloped from a single data source.\nLand cover/use data has been assembled for a test area consisting\nof four townships in central Michigan, representing a diversity of land\ncover/use conditions. The townships were inventoried through both LANDSAT data processing and manual interpretation of 1:60,000 and 1:120,000\nNASA color-infrared photography acquired in 1975. Both data sets have\nbeen geocoded to the dominant category per grid cell.\nAt this time the registration between the LANDSAT and photo-interpreted files are being evaluated. The next step is to identify cells\n\n17\n\n~,i\n\nU."~DSAT\n\nUat ..\n\n.\n""I~\n\nT.jtllt\n\n~~\n\n,\n:I"pll\n\nLANDSAT lioatA\n\nf--\n\nC.llu."rl::atlon \'lInd\nInltl .. l A.:~uncv\nV\'I I I",I,I.m\n\n--\n\nl\n\n,""0\'0\'\n\nKIl\'S\nc;round SUfve)\' IbU\n\n-J -~\n\nT,UIII 1\n\nI\n\nI\'holos\n\n(; \' ,IIIII.J rruth\n\nI\n\nr-\n\nI\n\nI\n\n,(,-Poitt\n\nI\n\nI\n\n\'r..

To\naccomplish this task a cell-level category matrix will be generated\nfrom the combined geocoded file. This matrix cross-tabulates the\nland cover categories identified from LANDSAT data with the categories\nderived from photo-interpretation.\nAnalysis of this matrix indicates the initial overall compatibility of the two categorizations. More importantly, the analysis allows\nthe pinpointing of cells that, on the basis of photointerpretive information, have been mis-categorized by LANDSAT processing.\nThe methodology developed provides a framework by which risers can\nintegrate selected data elements from LANDSAT, photographic, and map\nsources. The procedures and associated computer software to accomplish\nintegration have been developed, however, effective implementation requires indentifying the optimum data source for each land cover/use\ncategory. This is a complex issue which has warrented further investigation prior to operationally applying the integrated inventory method.\nTo determine the "best" data capture source and procedure for each category, both LANDSAT and photo categorization of land cover/use in four\ntownships in central. Michigan are being analyzed. The objective is to\nidentify a combination of data sources and procedures that provide a\nmore detailed, accurate, and cost-effective land cover/use inventory\ncompared with deriving all the data from a single source.\n\n19\n\nB2. Resource Analysis Program\nMany of the activities in which the RSP has participated have\nbeen involved with computer-based information storage, analysis, and\ndisplay systems. In these activities, data gathercd with remote\nsensing forms the base, against which other spatial data are comparatively analyzed. In addition to providing a more useful picture of\nthe study problem, I_hese information systems also provide an expanded\nopportunity for the role of remote sensing in resource-related decision\nmaking.\nIn response to the need for an effective analytical/mapping software package, the Project developed the Resource Analysis Program (RAP).\nRAP is a general utility, user-oriented software system, designed to\noperate off grid-geocoded data bases, including categorized LANDSAT\ndata.\nRAP features a variety of multi-task analytical and mapping phases\nI\t\n\n(Table 1). Each phase operates independently, but through a common\ndata structure. This permits the user to link the various phases into\nan analysis strategy, suited for many resource study problems.\nThis software system was initially tested in Windsor Township,\nEaton County, Michigan under contract to the Tri-County Regional Planning Commission (see Section C1 of this Report). The test resulted in\nan eleven map portfolio (example Fig. 2) focussing upon non-point source\npollution and waste disposal (Table 2).\nRAP is currently being developed to include an agricultural land\nvalue model. This model will develop a base land sales value, from\nwhich assessments can be made. The procedure is based upon that\nrecommended by the Michigan Tax Commission. The Eaton County Equalization Office is serving as the user agency. This agency has repeatedly\nexpressed the intention of incorporating this approach into their procedures.\n\n20\n\nTtkBLE 1\nPHASES OF RAP AND THEIR FUNCTION\n\nPhase\t\n\nFunction\n\n1.

Users Guide to Aerial ImaQery of Michtean\nPreparation of the guide has been a continuing effort for the past\ntwo years. Tt started as a simple revision of an existing guide (Users\nGuide to High Altitude Imagery of Michigan) but has subsequently developed into an undertaking of considerable magnitude as Information on the\nfull range of remotely-sensed imagery available of Michigan has been inIll\ncorporated into the new guide.\nA final draft of the guid,^ has been prepared during this reporting\nperiod. The Agricultural Experiment Station at MSU has accepted the\nguide for publication, and its editorial staff is presently reviewing\nthe draft. A brochure announcing the forthcoming release of the guide\nwill be distributed in the next few months. The Michigan Department of\nNatural Resources intends to financially support a portion of the\npublication costs. An initial printing of 1,500 to 2,000 copies will\nbe made.\nS UMARY\nThe Guide to Aerial Imagery of Michigan provides a single-source\nreference document which identifies aerial imagery available for areas\nin the state. It contains comprehensive indexes to: a) NASA LANDSAT\nsatellite and Skylab space craft imagery; b) high altitude imagery acquired by NASA RB57 and L12 aircraft; c) aerial photo coverage of counties\nsecured by various federal and state agencies; and d) photo coverage of\nlocal areas obtained by state agencies such as the Michigan Department\nof Natural Resources and by aerial survey firms.\nEach index presents information on photo coverage, date, scale,\nfilm type and source agency in a map or computer listing format and is\npreceded by general background information and appropriate explanatory\ncomments for effective use of the section. To further assist users,\na brief overview of the fundamentals of aerial imagery and a section\ndocumenting basic procedures for imagery acquisition is included.\nThe guide is printed on 8\'-5" X 11" paper drilled to fit standard\nthree ring binders and includes examples of black and white and color\nimagery.\n\nn =-.,_\t\n\n24\n\nCONTENTS\nIntroduction\n1.\n\nFundamentals of Aerial Imagery\n\n2.\n\nInformation on Obtaining Imagery\n\n3.\n\nLANDSAT Satellite Imagery\n\n4.\n\nSkylab Spacecraft Imagery\n\nS.\t\n\nNASA High Altitude Imagery\n\nb.\t\n\nRegional/County Imagery\n\n7.\t\n\nLocal Imagery\n\nAPPENDICES\nA.\n\nSelected References: Aerial Imagery Catalogs\n\nB.\n\nMailing Addresses\n\n^J\n\nr\n\n25\nC.\t\n\nC 0 N T K A C T\t\n\nA C T I V I T I E S\n\nDue to Froject demonstration activities, there has been an increasing\nneed by public and private agencies within the state for the utilization of\nremote sensing technology on a periodic project basis. In most cases, however,\nagencies lack the appropriate equipment and the photo interpretative skill to\nmeet the need. They usually do not retain staff with photo interpretation expertise because their services are not needed on a continual basis. However,\nmost agencies would like to have a means of acquiring such skills for limited\nperiods to complete specific projects. MSU now has the capability to meet this\nneed through either a contractual or student support basis due to the development of on-campus faculty and student remote sensing expertise by Project\npersonnel.\nAll of the contract activities have occurred as a direct spin-off from\nProject demonstration activities and demonstrate the commitment of funds by\nother agencies to the use of remote sensing. They have been included in this\nreport in order to substantiate the repetitive need for photo-derived information and the operational capability of previously demonstrated remote sensing\nprocedures for specific data acquisition needs.\n\n.\n\nJ\n\nI\n\n26\n\nCl. Windsor Township Natural Resources Informatior System\nTri-County Regional Planning Commission\n2722 East Michigan Avenue\nLansing, Michigan 48912\nThe Tri-County Regional Planning Commissi\t\nRemote Sensing Project to demonstrate the\t\nbased Natural Resource Information System G,\t\n\ncontracted with the\naess of a computer) for regional water\n\nquality studies. This study served as a prototype, providing the\nfirst opportunity for the Commission to evaluate the effectiveness of\na computer system to integrate remote sensing data with other natural\nresource Information. The immediate objective of the contract was to\ndevelop an eleven map portfolio, with accompanying technical report,\nspecifically focussed on l.anuscape features affecting non-point source\npollution and waste disposal. Longer term objectives include future\nsystem demonstrations for other regional, county and local agencies.\nThe NRIS was developed for Windsor Township, Eaton County, Michigan. This area was chosen because of a very rapidly developing land\nbase, 1 p rge acreage of prime and unique farmlands, and the rural-tourban pressures bein., placed on the Township.\nThe data base for the Windsor Township NRIS was constructed from\ncommonly available information sources: topographic map, land cover/\nuse map, soil map, and water well records. This data was recorded\nfor each 10-acre (4 hectare) piece of land, resulting in a matrixtype data structure of 48 rows and 48 columns. The Resource Analysis\nProgram (RAP), developed at `1SU, was the analytical/mapping software\nsystem used for the study.\nThe Windsor Township study was completed and all contract items\ndelivered In August, 1976. The Commission is currently evaluating the\nproject, including training of Commission staff in Z%o use of RAP. Tn\naddition, Project staff are currently developing additional analytical\nand mapping programs for assisting the Eaton County Equalization Office\nfor farmlank: equalization using the Windsor Township NRIS and RAP.\n\nF\n\n27\n\nC2. Comprehensive Resource Inventory and Evaluation System (CRIES) Project\nIn the last quarter of 1976, the U.S. Department of Agrtculture,\nEconomic Research Service (ERS) contracted with the Remote Sensing\nProject to provide consulting services for remote sensing and geographic data file construction. The FRS is developing an econometric\nmodel of the agricultural sector of the Dominican Republic. This\nnational policy model operates off a land-based information system which\nincludes land use.\nThe Remote Sensing Project is designing a data file system that\nis compatible with categorized ?.ANDSAT data. The Intralab at NASA,\nGoddard, is also cooperating by providing categorized data for two\ntest sites in the Dominican Republic. The intent of this effort is to\nevaluate the usefulness and cost-effectiveness of LANDSAT in future ERS\nprojecLs of this nature.\nIn addition to providing consulting servies for remote sensing,\nMSU staff are designing and constructing a spatial data file for the\nDominican Republic. The file consists of over 100,000 grid cells\nbased on the square kilometer grid of the UTM earth referencing system.\nProcedures have been developed to geo-code spatial data (crop types,\nsoil/climate maps, political boundaries, and so forth). This data\nfile will provide the necessary resource data for the ERS model. In\naddition, the data file will be transferred to the Dominican Republic\n(after suitable training) for in-country use in resource evaluation.\n\nA p p e n d i x\nP U B L I C A T I O N S\t\n\na n d\t\n\nP R E S E N T A T I O N S\n\n. . . . . . . . . . of the Michigan State University Project\n\n1.\n\n"Investigation of Land Resource Use in Southeast Michigan."
