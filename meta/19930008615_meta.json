After eighteen weeks of work, a waverider design powered by two augmented turbofans was chosen. The aircraft was designed to be based on an aircraft carrier and to cruise 6,000 nautical miles at Mach 4;80,000 feet and above. As a result the size of the aircraft was only allowed to have a length of eighty feet, fifty-two feet in wingspan, and roughly 2,300 square feet in planform area. Since this is a mainly cruise aircraft, sixty percent of its 100,000 pound take-off weight is JP fuel. At cruise, the highest temperature that it will encounter is roughly 1,100 F, which can be handled through the use of a passive cooling system.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19930008615, "id": "31ab2e597caa4c15803fe1a0284b7e06", "publicationDate": "1992-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19930008615.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19930008615/downloads/19930008615.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19930008615/downloads/19930008615.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19930008615/downloads/19930008615.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
