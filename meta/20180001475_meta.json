The name \"NAS\" has long been associated with leadership and innovation throughout the high-end computing (HEC) community. We play a significant role in shaping HEC standards and paradigms, and provide leadership in the areas of large-scale InfiniBand fabrics, Lustre open-source filesystems, and hyperwall technologies. We provide an integrated high-end computing environment to accelerate NASA missions and make revolutionary advances in science. Pleiades, a petaflop-scale supercomputer, is used by scientists throughout the U.S. to support NASA missions, and is ranked among the most powerful systems in the world. One of our key focus areas is in modeling and simulation to support NASA's real-world engineering applications and make fundamental advances in modeling and simulation methods.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 20180001475, "id": "01cc45fdc3dc425c83a8672788061a28", "publicationDate": "2017-02-21T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20180001475.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20180001475/downloads/20180001475.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20180001475/downloads/20180001475.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20180001475/downloads/20180001475.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
