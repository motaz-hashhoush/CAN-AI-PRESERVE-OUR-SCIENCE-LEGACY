To address this need, a team at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center has designed the Pucksat. The Pucksat is a highly versatile payload carrier structure compatible for launching on a Delta II two-stage vehicle as a system co-manifested with a primary payload. It is also compatible for launch on the Air Force Medium Class EELV. Pucksat's basic structural architecture consists of six honeycomb panels attached to six longerons in a hexagonal manner and closed off at the top and bottom with circular rings. Users may configure a co-manifested Pucksat in a number of ways. As examples, co-manifested configurations can be designed to accommodate dedicated missions, multiple experiments, multiple small deployable satellites, or a hybrid of the preceding examples. The Pucksat has fixed lateral dimensions and a downward scaleable height. The dimension across the panel hexagonal flats is 62 in. and the maximum height configuration dimension is 38.5 in. Pucksat has been designed to support a 5000 lbm primary payload, with the center of gravity located no greater than 60 in. from its separation plane, and to accommodate a total co-manifested payload mass of 1275 lbm.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 19990063805, "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Inst. of Aeronautics and Astronautics", "location": "United States"}}, "meetingId": "26c29fc86c3344739f2faf1c2b9e6198", "id": "1176f0df8d384ebaacbde7501008ada5"}, {"meta": {"organization": {"name": "Utah State Univ.", "location": "UT United States"}}, "meetingId": "26c29fc86c3344739f2faf1c2b9e6198", "id": "82ea5b4387b349b1ac0f6ffb42fbd962"}], "name": "Small Satellites", "id": "26c29fc86c3344739f2faf1c2b9e6198", "startDate": "1999-08-23T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 19990063805, "id": "fbbdafdc30a84db5b941375fe58234e9", "publicationDate": "1999-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
