Consideration is given to the space photovoltaic program, which was developed along two paths: one leading to high-performance ultralight weight solar arrays, the other to high output arrays. The space power materials and energy storage technology are discussed, together with the developmental aspects of an advanced solar dynamic power system and its subsystems. Special attention is given to the Nasa SP-100 Advanced Technology Project and the free-piston Stirling engine technology for nuclear power application.", "title": "Space power - Emerging opportunities", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-13T03:16:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19870028626, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Brandhorst, H.
