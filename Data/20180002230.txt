Working with customers\nand stakeholders to turn goals and objectives into measurements, requirements, a concept of operations,\nand mission success criteria. Deriving a technical approach and alternatives, as well as assessing and\nreducing risks. Organizing work and developing preliminary cost and schedule estimates. Developing roles\nand responsibilities, organizational structures, and building teams. Writing and submitting proposals per\nrequirements of relevant solicitations.\nImplementation - Executing procurements, design, manufacturing, integration, testing, and launch site\nactivities to deploy a successful system that meets project goals and objectives. Conducting operations and\nsustainment to obtain measurements or complete activities required to meet project goals and objectives.\nControlling project execution to approved plans and requirements while responding to issues that arise.\nAdjusting the project as resources and requirements change.\n\nProject Life Cycle\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 SMD-solicited projects tend to be specified as Principal\nInvestigator (PI) Led. MSFC\xe2\x80\x99s approach to PI-led\nprojects with Project Managers relies on clear definition\nof roles and how decision authority is exercised.\nRole\nPrincipal\nInvestigator\n(PI)\n\nResponsibility\nThe PI is responsible to the sponsoring SMD Division (i.e., relevant Program\nOffice) and the STO management for the overall conduct and success of the\ninvestigation within cost and schedule constraints. The PI leads the science\nactivities, and serves as the primary point of contact for all external partners and\nscience stakeholders. The PI establishes the Level 1 requirements with NASA\nHQ, and may exercise control of the lower level requirements.\n\nProject\nManager\n(PM)\n\nThe PM is responsible to the MSFC and STO management for the day to day\nexecution of the project/activity. This responsibility is delegated from and in\npartnership with the PI when the activity is PI-led. The PM develops the project\nplan; develops and maintains the schedule; plans, controls, and executes the\nbudget with PI concurrence; oversees risk management; executes configuration\nmanagement activities and COR responsibilities; and serves as the activity\xe2\x80\x99s\nprimary interface with MSFC\xe2\x80\x99s engineering management.\n\nPI-Led Projects\n\nNASA PM \xe2\x80\x9cCompetency\xe2\x80\x9d Model\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nKnow WHAT your team is responsible for delivering and WHY you are doing it, and keep your team focused (Define and\nManage your Project Content).\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nKnow WHEN you will get it done, and own making sure you and your team know when that is and where you stand on your\nplan at any given time (Develop and Manage your Schedule)\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nMake sure you have the RESOURCES you need to get the \xe2\x80\x9cWHAT\xe2\x80\x9d done, and maintain the conscience of your project in\nusing these resources wisely to deliver value to the customer, creating opportunities along the way to strengthening our\ncapabilities for what comes next (Define and Manage your Budget)\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nYour \xe2\x80\x9ctriple constraint\xe2\x80\x9d of COST-SCHEDULE-TECHNICAL, Safety considerations, and external constraints and obstacles\nthat you operate under, are all drawn and adjusted on a canvas of RISK. Use this canvas daily to understand and\ncommunicate the how these are tied together, and the possibilities and hazards behind every decision, opportunity, and\nevent. (Define and Manage your Risk)\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nValue and pursue clear and open COMMUNICATION with your team (including their management), PI, customers, and\nstakeholders.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nManage your resources, schedule, content, and relationships with integrity, promoting SUSTAINABLE project execution,\norganizational health, and respect for each other.\n\nSRPD PM Values & Expectations\n\n'
