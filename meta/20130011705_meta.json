The SDR has an analog and a digital automatic gain control (AGC) and the response of the AGCs to changes in SDR input power and temperature was characterized prior to the launch and installation of the SCAN Testbed on the ISS. The AGCs were used to estimate the SDR input power and SNR of the received signal and the characterization results showed a nonlinear response to SDR input power and temperature. In order to estimate the SDR input from the AGCs, three algorithms were developed and implemented on the ground software of the SCAN Testbed. The algorithms include a linear straight line estimator, which used the digital AGC and the temperature to estimate the SDR input power over a narrower section of the SDR input power range. There is a linear adaptive filter algorithm that uses both AGCs and the temperature to estimate the SDR input power over a wide input power range. Finally, an algorithm that uses neural networks was designed to estimate the input power over a wide range. This paper describes the algorithms in detail and their associated performance in estimating the SDR input power.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20130011705, "endDate": "2013-03-09T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Inst. of Aeronautics and Astronautics", "location": "United States"}}, "meetingId": "502a1f0c3f99499f8b9803f093a37555", "id": "421e0d2d7b7c44d3bb771bc8421c07fe"}, {"meta": {"organization": {"name": "PHM Society", "location": "New York, NY, United States"}}, "meetingId": "502a1f0c3f99499f8b9803f093a37555", "id": "7577e3eeb7d44065bcb1f443fc3bc7b5"}, {"meta": {"organization": {"name": "Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers", "location": "United States"}}, "meetingId": "502a1f0c3f99499f8b9803f093a37555", "id": "cc832320bcdd4c9eaa562a673bebcde0"}], "name": "2013 IEEE Aerospace Conference", "location": "Big Sky, MT", "id": "502a1f0c3f99499f8b9803f093a37555", "startDate": "2013-03-02T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20130011705, "id": "5a2855020db446f582d779c0bdb382d6", "publicationDate": "2013-03-02T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20130011705.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20130011705/downloads/20130011705.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20130011705/downloads/20130011705.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20130011705/downloads/20130011705.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
