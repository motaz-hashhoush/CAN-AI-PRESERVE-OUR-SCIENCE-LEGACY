But observations from space are alleviating this situation. Three spacecraft moving away from the Sun-Pioneer 10 and Voyagers 1 and 2-are expected to penetrate the boundaries of the heliosphere within the next few years. All three spacecraft first passed close to Jupiter, and now their extended missions have become explorations of the outer heliosphere. The boundaries of the heliosphere are a standing \"termination shock\" in the solar wind surrounding the Sun and the \"heliopause,\" dividing the solar wind from the local interstellar medium. Uncertainties about the size and shape of these boundaries make it difficult to estimate exactly the time when the spacecraft will pass them. The termination shock may be nearly spherical or highly elongated, depending on how fast the local interstellar medium is flowing past the heliosphere. Pioneer 10, traveling downstream from the oncoming interstellar wind, may reach the termination shock first if, in fact, the shock is spherical. If the shock is elongated, having a larger dimension in the downstream direction, then Voyagers 1 and 2, traveling upstream, will encounter the shock first. Once these two spacecraft reach the termination shock, they will then pass through a region of solar wind plasma that has been heated by the shock. After a few years, they will pass the heliopause and go into the interstellar medium.", "title": "The Outer Heliosphere", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-19T04:33:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19990071291, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Axford, W.
