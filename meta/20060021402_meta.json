The amount of time required for passengers and flight attendants to be securely seated (that is, seated with seat belts fastened) currently is not known. To determine secured seating-based warning times, a consortium of aircraft safety organizations have conducted an experiment involving a series of timed secured seating trials. This demonstrative experiment, conducted on October 1, 2, and 3, 2002, used a full-scale B-747 wide-body aircraft simulator, human passenger subjects, and supporting staff from six airlines. Active line-qualified flight attendants from three airlines participated in the trials. Definitive results have been obtained to provide secured seating-based warning times for the developers of turbulence warning technology", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 20060021402, "id": "6fdeda5d4da94bfaba4cf148f9a63705", "publicationDate": "2006-04-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20060021402.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20060021402/downloads/20060021402.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20060021402/downloads/20060021402.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20060021402/downloads/20060021402.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
