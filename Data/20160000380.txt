As such, governmental policies have kept self sufficiency high, with a rate of\n95.7% in 2014. Importantly though, the consumption of rice\nhas been rapidly declining due to diet change. Until the food\npolicy reforms of 2004, the Korean government played an important role in increasing and stabilizing the income of rice\nfarmers. A rice reserves policy was then initiated in 2005 to enhance food security (see Figure 6). Under this program, the\nKorean government specifices the amount of rice stocks and\nre-evaluates this amount every three years. In 2014, Korea\njoined the Emergency Rice Reserve program of the Association\nof Southeast Asian Nations and the three East Asia nations of\nChina, Japan, and South Korea (known as ASEAN+3). The goal of\nthis group is to strengthen food security among member states\nwhile minimizing market disruptions.\n\nwheat\nmaize\nsoybean\n\n10\n\n2. METHODS & BACKGROUND\n\nFor the trade data, we obtain bilateral trade data from the Statistics Division of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAOSTAT,\nhttp://faostat3.fao.org/). We aggregate by converting wheat,\nmaize, and soybean commodities into kilocalories. Our list of\ncommodities includes: wheat, flour of wheat, bran of wheat,\nmacaroni, bread, bulgur, pastry, breakfast cereals, wafer, maize,\ngerm of maize, flour of maize, maize oil, soybeans, soybean oil,\ncake of soybeans, soya sauce, and soya paste.\n\n2\n\nTotal Cultivated Land\n\n6\n\n20\n\n30\n\nHUN\n\nWe analyze South Korea\xe2\x80\x99s domestic food production and its\nlinks to the global food trade network to understand its vulnerability to systemic risk in the global food system. For our domestic analyses, we use data from Statistics Korea\n(www.index.go.kr) for the period 1998 to 2013. We also make\nuse of the report Agriculture in Korea 2015 from the Korea Rural\nEconomic Institute. We focus on assessing self sufficiency in\nSouth Korea\xe2\x80\x99s grain production over time (Figures 1 and 2).\nAlso, we assess changes in cultivated area (Figure 3).\n\nSelf Sufficiency\n\n\xe2\x88\x922\n00\n7\n\n35\n\n%\n\nFood security in South Korea is tightly linked to the global food\nsystem. The country\xe2\x80\x99s production of major grains declined\nfrom 5.8 million metric tons (mmt) in 1998 to 4.8 mmt in 2014,\nwhich caused the country\xe2\x80\x99s grain self sufficiency to decline\nfrom 31.4% to 24%. This decline is a consequence of several\nfactors including reductions in domestic agricultural land, governmental policies supporting industry over agriculture, and a\npush towards trade liberalization. South Korea\xe2\x80\x99s self sufficiency\nis now one of the lowest among Organisation for Economic\nCo-operation and Development (OECD) countries, leaving it\nvulnerable to disruptions in the global food system.\n\nTotal Grain Self Sufficiency\n\nhectares\n\n1. INTRODUCTION\n\n4. DISCUSSION\nThe consumption of rice has been diminishing in South Korea, while the demand for other major grains has sharply increased in recent years. Yet\nrice is still the only grain that the government actively manages for food emergencies. Further, South Korea is dependent on a few major exporters\nfor commodities like wheat, maize, and soybean. It is therefore essential for the government to understand better the stability of its major trade\npartners. In fact, South Korea\xe2\x80\x99s seven largest food trade partners have a very limited capacity to buffer food disruptions (Figure 5). Thus South Korea\nis vulnerable if one or more of these countries were to encounter production difficulties. We recommend that the Korean government assess the stability of its trade partners and develop strategies to deal with a broader range of potential food disruptions. Acknowledgments: M.J.
