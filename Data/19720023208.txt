Reaction\nControl Subsystems. _e review was conducted during July and August,\n1970. Detailed review of component failure histories, qualification\nadequacy, inanufacturingflow, checkout requirements and flow, ground\nsupport equipment interfaces, subsystem interface verification, protectlve devices, and component design did not reveal major weaknesses\nIn the Command Service Module (CSM) Reaction Control System (RCS). No\nchanges to the CSM RCS were recommended. The assessment reaffirmed\n\'theadequacy of the CSM RCS for future Apollo missions.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThis paper is a review of Apollo Command and Service Module Reaction Control Subsystem assessment. The review was a part of the general Apollo Program assessment conducted during July and August, 1970.\nThe results of the review were reported in a viewgraph presentation to\nNASA Headquarters. The presentation was a brief summary of the areas\nreviewed. Background data was not presented or discussed. Background\ndata consisted of flight performance summaries, component failure histories, component qualification and configuration histories, component\nmanufacturing and checkout flows, component checkout requirement histories, summaries of all Ground Support Equipment and Special Measurement Devices (SMD) interfacing with the spacecraft hardware, summaries\nof the subsystem protective devices, and a complete component design\nmanual.\n\n"\n\nThis Working Paper will preserve and be a reference for the data\ngathered for the subsystem assessment. Viewgraphs used for the visual\npresentation are the figures and tables in this Working Paper. The\nsequence of subjects follows that used for the viewgraph presentation.\nThe subjects and component data are presented using the Service Module\nRCS as the baseline.

Results of acoustic and vfbration tests on\nthe SM structure at North American Rockwell (NR) and results of the RCS\nflight data from BPI9 caused concern. Consequently, one quad on Spacecraft 002 was instrumented with six vibration sensors; two on the forward engine, two on the counterclockwise (CCW) engine, one on the panel,\nand one on the oxidizer tank support.

Consequently, a new valve was designed, quallfied, and\nused on Spacecraft Oil, and all subsequent spacecraft.\nAnalysis of available dat_ indicated the -Y/-X quad D engin_ wa:_\ninoperative or malfunctioning, The failure mode mould not be d_termJn,:_d\nbees,se of ]_ek of Information, It was deduced, h_wever, that beoause\nu\nbil,avelindications of firing we.rerecorded, ele_:tri(_-al\ncontlnulty existed in _I,least one of the automati_ coils of the engine,ma],fun(_t:h)n:ing.\nAiso, if both propel]._ntswere :_\']owlng\nbut not producing thrust, as in\nthe case of a _ombustlon chamber failure, the overall quad pressur_ drop\nwould have been approximately.,wice that of the norm,_.l\nt\npressure drop o_\n_\nthe other guido. This was not true. B_(:aus(:o other data wore avail_\nable for further analysis, it could be concluded that for an _mknown\nreason, when the SC[_signaled the -Y engJ.nesto f:ireusing the a_tomr_ti(_\ncoils, either the fuel or oxidizer valve of one of the -Y eng:ines (pr_>l)ably\'the -Y/-X quad D engine) failed to respond. Thus the engine was\ndisabled. Postflight analysis of the data led to no remedial action.\nThe SM RCS quad temperature increase because of boost heating was\nnear the predicted values and verified quad temperatures established\nduring Mission A-fOR. _ad temperatures caused by soakback after eng:ine\nfirings were near anticipated values. Temperature profiles of valves\nand injectors on the roll and pitch engines on quad A showed definite\ncooling effects after the first burn at CSM/S-IVB separation. This\ncooling effect is in contrast to the expected temperature increases because of soakback in other quads. Propellant tank and manifold temperatures were 70\xc2\xb0 ! 5\xc2\xb0 F throughout the mission, which was expected.\nQuad B valve and _jector head measured temperatures were nominal for\nthe realized duty cycles. As expected, boost heating was most pronounced\nin the forward firing engines. There was a maximum temperature of\n200\xc2\xb0 F on the injector head.\n\nCommand Module Reaction Control Subsystem\nA\n\nDescri_0tion.-The Block I CM RCS consisted of two identical redundant systems, A and B. Systems A and B operate simultaneously. Each\nsystem of the CM RCS consisted of six 93-pound thrust ablative cooled\nrocket engines, an oxidizer tank, fuel tank, helium tank, and filters,\nvalves, and regulators (figs. 2-11, 2-\'12,and 2-15). The propellants\nused were N204 (oxidizer) and MMH (fuel). The purpose of the CM RCS\nwas to control CM attitude after CM/SM separation.\n\nI\n\n!\n\n2-26\n\n,o\n\nFuel\n\nsystem A\n\n\\\n\nCxid_zer\n\nFigure 2-11.- Command module RCS component location,\nMission A$-201, +Y axis.\n\nFigure 2-12.- Command module RCS component locations,\nMission AS-201, -Y axis.\n\n\\\n\ni\n/\n\nI\n\n--__\n-.\n\n";\n\n....\n\nI\n\n_-1\n\n....\n\nJ I I- LLI22........\n_\n\n.\n\n_\n\n__,Jr:n\n\n...........\n\n: I\n\n,i\'[\'l\'\n\nIIlII\n\n...............\n\nz..-..___\n\n.\n\ni_\n\nI\n. _\n\n_\n\n.\n\n2-28\n\nThe CM RCS components and operating principles were similar to the\nSM RCS except for the engines. The CM RCS engines were ablative cooled.\nThe SM RCS engines were radiation cooled. The CM RCS engines included\nautomatic and direct coils in the electric oparatcd propellant valves,\nAutomatic coils were operated by signals from the SC_. Direct coils\nwere operated by signals from the propellant dump sequencer _nstalled\nLn Spacecraft 009 to _ontrol the disposal (du_zp)of propellants before\nthe CM landed. Duri_ manned missions the crew dumps the propellants.\nAll CM RCS components were certified for the short duration mission. The only CM component known to have failed prior to lift-off was\nthe CM B system relief valve burst diaphragm for fuel. The ruptured\ndiaphragm was found during checkout testing. It was not replaced for\nthe _ission. (The burst diaphragm provided redundant sealing and was\nnot required for the mission.) As in the SM, some primary helium check\nvalves were leaking because they were out of tolerance. They were :lot\nreplaced because the secondary valves were functioning normally.\n\n,,\n\nPerformance.- Control by the CM RCS was initiated following SM/CM\nseparat--_ona\'t_+ 1495 seconds. Operation was nominal until T + 1469\nand T + seconds when electrical malfunctions disabled automatic operation of systems A and B, respectively.\nFailure of the B system logic power caused the B system engine\ndirect coils to be inoperative at the time of propellant depletion burn\n(T + 191_ to T + 2050 seconds). Therefore, both A and B system propellants were burned through the A system engines with the exception of\nthe +P engine which was normally disabled. The burning resulted in\ngreater than nominal charring of the A system engines, especially the\nroll engines. Satisfactory propellant jettison was accomplished, however, with nominal propellant residuals.\n\n"\n\nDuring the purge operation, data indicated that the A system fuel\nand B system oxidizer tank pressures did not decay. Postflight inspection of the A and B system helium interconnect squibs showed the A system fuel tank heiium bypass squib and B system oxidizer tank helium\nbypass squib had not fired, which prevented depressurization. Also the\nvalves were disabled by the B system logic power anomaly.\nAs expected, from launch to system activation, all component temperature measurements includir_ the propellant and helium \'tanks,engine\nvalves, and the engine outer wall remained constant at launch temperatures of 60\xc2\xb0 to 6_\xc2\xb0 F. Within telemetry accuracies, helium and propellant tank pressures remained constant at loaded conditions from launch\nto system activation. There was no indication of helium leakage.\n\nI\n_,\n\ni\nj\n\n/\n\n/\n\n_-_9\n\nDecay in helium souree pressures because of system activation was\nnominal and agreed with calculated pressures. Followi_ system activation, small propellant usage resulted in no noticeable change in source\npressure prior to the depletion burn at T + 1919 seeonds.\n\xc2\xb0\n\nBased on measured propellant residuals and nominal propellant flow\nrates during burnoff, propellant usage was estimated to be nomlnal\n(approximately 12 to 13 pounds). The following _mounts of propellants\nwere removed during deactivation: _ pounds of fael were removed from\nthe helium side and purge lines of the CM syste_nsA and B; 2 pounds of\nfuel from the propellant side of both systems; i pound of oxidizer from\nthe helium side and purge lines of both systems; and l-l/4 pounds of\noxidizer from the propellant side of both systems. The propellants removed from the helium side of the systems were not unexpected, because\nthe B system fuel and A system oxidizer tank bypass lines were opened\nduring purging.\nAll measured temperatures showed nominal and in some instances\nless than expected effects of reentry heating and depletion burn on the\nCM components. The propellant tank temperatures re_ained constant at\napproximately 60= to 65\xc2\xb0 F.\nDuring recovery of the spacecraft after landing, no problems were\nreported with the CM RCS or with propellants or propellant fumes. During deactivation which began 5 days later at Norfolk, Virginia, the\nB system +Y oxidizer valve failed to open when the direct coil was commanded. A short to ground was found on both sides of the coil. During\ndecontamination operations, the electrical leads to the coil were inadvertently reversed on the spacecraft side of a terminal strip. Both\nsides of the cell were connected to ground. The automatic coil was in\nworking order.\n\n*\n\n_,\n\nWhen the A and B system oxidizer isolation valves were cycled to\nthe closed position during the deactivation procedures, the valve indicators showed the valves closed, but gas flow through the valves did\nnot decrease. This indicates both valves were seized in the open position. The valves were normally open during the flight and had no inflight function. The 1_ilure bad no effect on the flight. Similar\nproblems during development and qualification of the valve indicated\nincompatibility between the oxidizer and the valve. The valve was replaced on Spacecraft Oll and subsequent spacecraft. There was no problem with the fuel isolation valves.\n\nI\n\nPostfl_ght inspection revealed the fuel bypass valves on both the\nA and B systems to be incorrectly wired. System A valve was wired to\nthe B pyre battery instead of the A battery. System B valve was wired\nto the A pyre battery instead of the B battery. As a result of this\n\n!\n\n):\n\n2-30\n\ncondition, the hellumpressure\nin A and B systems was able to bleeddown during purging.\nIn the normal configuration, high p_\'essure helium\nwould have been trapped in the B system.\nRequested postflight testing of the CM RCS consisted of propellant\nbladder leak checks, electrical integrity checks of the CM B system\n+Y engine direct oxidizer co:J1, oxidizer isolation valve failure analysis, functional checks of the engine valves, char analysis of the\nA system CCW and -Y engines, and relief valve leakage \'tests.\nNo oT.hel problems\n\nwere\n\nfound during\n\nthe poztfllght\n\ntesting.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 <,,\n\ni\n-\n\n...............\n.......

This was an unmanned suborbital flight. Lift-off from\nlaunch complex 34, Cape Kennedy, Florida, was at l_:l_ P.M.e.s.t.\n(17:19 G.m.t.) August -#,\xc2\xb0r\'\n1966. The spacecraft CM landed safely In the\nprimary landing area in the southwest Paelfic O<.eannear Wake Island\napproximately 1 hour 73 minutes later (18:48 G.m.t.), and was recovered.\nThe major spacecraft mission objectives were to demonstrate the\nstructural integrity and compatibility of the spacecraft/uprated Saturn I\nconfiguration, to verify subsystem operation, and to evaluate the spacecraft heat shield performance during a high heat lea4 reentry.\n\nPerformance Summary\nThe CM and SM RCS infllght performance was nominal during the\n_isslon. All maneuvers using RCS thrusters were completed as planned\nand attitude rates as predicted.\n\nService Module Reaction Control Subsystem\nDescription.- The SM RCS configuration on Spacecraft Oll was identical to that on Spacecraft 009 with the following exceptions:\n1. The SM RCS engine for Spacecraft Oll was of the Spacecraft 012\nconfiguration. It produced lO0 pounds of thrust rather than 95 pounds\nof thrust and had a fuel valve thermal standoff to increase thermal\nresistance between the valve and injector.\n\'\n\n.\n\n2. The propellant isolation valves were of a new design with\nimproved performance and propellant compatibility.\n3. The helium isolation valve was of the Spacecraft 0.12conf_guration, which used an improved poppet design.\n\nI\n\n!\n\nAll SM RCS components on Spacecraft Oll were certified for the\nmission. No components were known to be malfunctioning or failed prior\nto lift-off. However, a quad C relief valve burst diaphragm was ruptured\nbecsuse of a pressure surge during activation.\nAnomalies.- The only anomaly encountered during the SM RCS prelaunch\ncountdown or mission occurred during activation of quad C on the pad\napproximately 4-1/2 hours prior to launch. When the helium isolation\n\n!\n\n!\n)\nt\n\ni\n\n2-32\n\nvalve on quad C was openad to pressurize the propellant tanks, pressL_ro\ndownstream of the regulators surged to 320 psta during the aetivatlon\ntransient and ruptured the relief valve burst diaphragm. The pressure\nstabilized at 220 psia following activation, indieatlng the averpressure\n%uptured the burst diaphragm and vented through the roller valve. At\nthe first BM ECS burn, pressure downstream of the regulator dropped to\nnominal regulated pressure, IndJaating the regulator was \xc2\xa3un_.tioning\nproperly.\nFor subsequent missions, this malfunet:_onwas avoided by loakln_\nthe regulators with pad pressure prior to open:Iz_ghe helium isolatiG_\nt\nvalves.\nAnother possible ano_mly was the master caution and warning light\ncoming on approximately 3 seconds into the flight. Examination of the\nRCS quad regulated helium_enifold pressures revealed that during the\nfirst ll0 seconds of the mission, the regulated helium pressure transducer output on quad D indicated a considerable amount of data scatter,\nsome data points going below 139 psia. The first time this occurred\nwas approximately T + 5 seconds. Because other instrumentation data\n(propellant manifold pressures) showed the regulated pressure to be\ncorrect, it could be assumed the transducer was malfunctioning. Recognizing that a helium manifold pressure signal below lg9 psia would\nactivate the caution and warning light, this data scatter should have\nand apparently did activate the warning light.\n\n\',\n\nThe output from the quad D regulated helium pressure transducer\nwas nominal after T + llO seconds and remained throughout the flight.\nThe malfunction was probably intermittent and associated with high vibration during launch. A history of problems was associated with the splice\nbetween transducers and the spacecraft wiring. During Spacecraft Oll\ncheckout at Kennedy Space Center (KSC), high resistances andpoor contact\nwere found in several instrumentation splices. The splices were remade\nat KSC and verified to be satisfactory. However, it could be possible\nfor the vibration during launch to cause momentary bad connections, which\nwould show as voltage and pressure decreases. To preclude such problems,\nsplicing procedures were reviewed for inadequacies, better quality control was initiated, and each splice was potted and bonded to the quad D\npanel to prevent flexing.\n\n"\'_\n"\n\nPez\'formance.-Performance of the SM RCS throughout the mission was\nnominal. All mission objectives were met. System performance was verJ.fied as satisfactory for the AS-20_ nLission. Spacecraft accelerations\nproduced by the RCS were nominal for both attitude hold and maneuvering.\nAll measured pressures and ten_0eratureswere nontinal,showing except for\nthe quad C regulated pressure during the boost phase.\n\n!\n:\n\n- .......\n\n......\n\n=u=: :_-\n\n:::: : L:\n\nILJ\n\nJI\n\n-L -I\'\nII\nIL lr\n\nThe fuel for the mission was changed from Aerozlne 20 (A-DO) to\nmonomethyl hMdrazine (MMH) because of engine problems associated with\nA-90. Two hundred and sixty pounds of SM RCS propellant were used,\nwhich compared favorably with the preflight predicted usage. During\nthe mission, it was estimated that a total of 17 O00 engine firings\nwere made.\no\n\nCommand Module Reaction Control Subsystem\n,\n\nDeseriti_.The eo_mmandmodule RCS _onftguratlon on Spacecraft Oll\nwas identical to Spacecraft 009 except:\n1. The propellant isolation valves were of a new deslgn with :Lmproved perforrg,.ncend propellant compatibility.\na\n2. The CM RCS engine for Spacecraft 011 was of the Spacecraft 012\nconfiguration having an epoxy coated throat and liner and improved valve\ndesign.\n3. The oxidizer and fuel tanks were of Spacecraft 012 configuration,\nwhich used net size bladders in both tanks and 9-mil ends in the oxLdizer\ntank bladders; both tanks had liquid side vents.\nAll CM RCS components on Spacecraft Oll we_,\'e\ncertified for the\nmission. No components were known to be malfunctioning or to have failed\nprior to lift-off.\n\n\'\n\nAnomalies.- One CM RCS anomaly was identified. The anomaly concerned the CM system A oxidizer and the system B fuel relief valve burst\ndiaphragms found ruptured during postflight inspection. An examination\nof the data at the time of CM RCS activation indicated a pressure surge\noccurred similar to the pressure surge for the SM RCS quad C. The ullage\nvolumes of the CM were smaller than in the SM. Because of this, restrictire orifices were placed in the helium supply lines to limit the maximum\nhelium flow rate. It was determined that the orifice size used was marginal.\n\nm\n\nTherefore, the _lock II orifice was reduced to a smaller size.\n\nPerformance.- Performance of the CM RCS from activations just prior\nto CM/SM separation until system purge was nominal. All mission objectives were met. Performance was certified as satisfactory for the AS-204\nmission. The CM accelerations in pitch, yaw, and roll and spacecraft\nattitudes were nominal throughout reentry.

This was a long duration firlt_ of\n442 seconds which provided a 12 019._ by 18-nautical-mile free return\norbit.\n\n_\n\nAfter SPS engine cutoff, \'theCS_ was maneuvered to a cold-soak\nattitude with the minus X axis oriented toward the sun. The cold-soak\nattitude was maintained for approximately 6 hours.\n\n,\n\nBecause the SPS was used to insert the spacecraft into the desired\nhigh apogee, insufficient propellant remained to gain the high velocity\ndesired from the second SPS engine firing. Specifically, the total\npropellant remaining would allow 22 percent of the desired increase of\nvelocity. For this reason, a decision was made to inhibit the second\nfiring. A complete firing sequence was performed including all nominal\nevents, except thrust was inhibited.\nAfter the SPS cutoff signal, the CSM was maneuvered to separation\nattitude and SM was separated at 09:56:97. This was followed by CM\nentry attitude orientation and coast to _00 000 feet.\nAt 09:38:29, the entry interface was reached with a velocity of\n32 830 feet per second and a flight path angle of -5.85 degrees. Interface conditions were less than planned. As a result, heating rates and\nloads during entry were lower than desired.\n\n....\n\n\'.\n\n_\n\n6\n\nI\n\'\n\nThe parachute deployment sequence was normal. Drogue del_loyment was at 09:51:27. Landing occurred at approximately 09:_7:20 and\n\ni\n\nwas about 49 nautical miles uprange of the targeted landing point of\n157 degree_ ii minutes west longitude and 27 degrees 19 minutes north\nlatitude.\nBoth _CS (CM and SM) performed nominally except for the thermal\ncontrol of one quad.\nAll maneuvers using the RCS were completed satisfactorily.\nNormal maneuver rates, accelerations,\nand translations\nvelocity changes were attained.\nPropellant usage by both systerm was\nnormal.\nThe thermal control system for the SM RCS maintained the en_Lne\n\n"\n\nmounting structure and injector head temperatures at satisfactory lew_ls\nfor quads A, B, and D. Quad C displayed anomalous temperatures during_\nthe early port,.on of the cold-soak phase.\n\nService\n\nModule Reaction\n\nThe SM RCS was similar\n\nControl\n\nSubsystem\n\n\'to the one used for the Apollo\n\n4 mission;\n\nsome engines were Block II configuration\nunits with integral screens\nt" - _ropellant valves.\nNo components were known to be malfunctionin_\nor l_,_erative prior to lift-off.\n\nin\n\nEngine activity.- Engine activity during the cold-soak period was\ngreater than planned, partly because of the decreased vehicle inertia\nresulting from the longer-than-planned\nSPS engine firing.\nOver control\ncaused by four engine roll control of a relatively light vehicle increased the activity.\nTwo engine control can be selected during manned\nflights.\nApproximately\n18 000 engine firings were made during the\nmission; 569 pounds of propellant were used.\nThermal\n\ncontrol.-\n\nThe thermal\n\ncontrol system\n\non Apollo\n\n6 was iden-\n\ntical to Apollo 4 except that the Apollo 4 heaters were bonded and\nmechanically\nclamped to the engine mounting structures.\nThe Apollo 6\nheaters were bonded to the engine mounting structures.\nMechanical\nclamps were incorporated on Apollo 4 because of uncertainties\nconcerning\nheater-mounting\nstructure bond strengths.\nVerification of bond quality\npermitted deletion of the mechanical clamps for Apollo 6. The heaters\nwere bonded to the mounting structures on Block II spacecraft.\nThe primary and secondary thermal control systems were actuated at hatch closeout and remained active throughout the flight.\nThe temperatures of the\nengine mounting structures of each of the four quads were monitored\nfrom launch through SM/CM separation.\nIn addition, the temperatures of\nthe injectors of the following engines were monitored during the same\ntime period:\nnegative (-) pitch engine _n quad A, positive (+) yaw\nengine in quA.d B, clockwise roll eng:ine in quad C, and count_rcloek_.;se\nroll engine in quad D.\n\nI\n_\n\n,I\n\ne-39\n\nThe therm_l control system maintained the engine mountln4gstructures and instrumented injectors of _uads A, B, and D at satisfactory\ntemperatures during the flight. During the early portion of the coldsoak _hase, the quad C engine mounting structure cooled excessively.\nAnomalous temperature excursions occurred in the qaad C clockwise roll\nengine _njeetor.\n\n\'\n\n_xlmum launch temperatures for the mounting structures and _l.njeetots of the four instrumented orAgineswere comparable to or slightly\nhigher than those encountered dtArir4ghe Apollo 4 mission. A comparison\nt\nof trajectory parameters Indleated that the lau_eh aerodynamic,heating\nof the quads should have been slightly higher than the Apollo 4 flight.\nThe RCS engines were inactive during the two revolutions prior to\nS-IVB separation. The performance of the thermal eor_trolsystem during\nthis time cannot be fully assessed. There were periods when telecommunication network station coverage was not complete. However, available data indicate the thermal switches and heaters operated in a nominal manner to maintain the engine mounting structures and _tnJector\nheads within the temperature range of llO\xc2\xb0 to 140\xc2\xb0 F.\nDuring the approximately 5.9-hour inertial cold-soak, quads B and\nC were shaded and quads A and D had sun exposure at an oblique angle.\nDuring the cold-soak period, the quad A and D heaters underwent multiple\ncycles and maintained the engine mounting structures and the instrumented injector heads at satisfactory temperature levels.\n\nCommand Module Reaction Control Subsystem\nThe Apollo 6 CM RCS was identical to Apollo 4 CM and all system\ncomponents were Block i. Prior to lift-off no components were known to\nhave been malfunctioning or inoperative.\nPerformance.- From activation until landing, performance of the\nsystem was normal. The performance was verified as satisfactory for\n\n,\n\nManeuvers ._-During entry, the system performed a pitch maneuver\nand roll maneuvers, and provided attitude-hold control. The angular\nmanned missions.\nacceleration produced by the engines was typically low for the first\npulse or pulses of an engine. This was most apparent in the positive\npitch engine which was commanded "ON" within i second after system actiration. At first, no effect was noted on the body rates of the vehicle,\nthen rates implied reduced engine thrust and finally nominal engine\nthrust level. A similar effect was noted duri:_ the Apollo 4 m_ssion\nand represented normal system activation. The slow buildup was noted :_n\n\nI\n\n_ i\n!\n\n,\n\n1::: 77-:.i.....\n....\n.................\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n........\n\n_,\n\n,,,,\n\n.\n\n........................\n-\n\n_\n\n_\n\n_\n\n.\n\n_\n\n-\n\n..........\n\n2-40\n\nthe chamber pressure of the first pulse of the A system\nwise roll engine and the associated roll body rate.\n\neountereloek-\n\n____em_ioressures.- When the helilan pressurlzat[on\nsystems were\n_etivated, the source pressure of eaeh system dropped 680 psi.\nThis\ndecrease, 240 pcl greater than during the Apollo 4 _,iseion, was caused\nbsr the increased oxidizer tank ullage resulting from off-loading\n9 pounds less oxidizer in each system.\nAt. the time the helium purge\nwas terminated, the A and B system source pressures were 273 and 2_3\np_:l.a (referenced to 70\xc2\xb0), respectively.\nSimilar pressures occurred\nduring the Apollo 4 m tsslon. The purge system was rood:I\nfled for future\n(:ommand modules to permit a more rapid purging.\n\n,\n\nControl flr_:ng propellant consuml_tion.- Propellant consumption\nduring the mi_s:|on was compared with preflight predlcted consumption.\nThe 84 pounds of propellant eXl)ended for control :firings were 6 pounds\nless than were used for this purpose during the Apollo 4 mission.\nPropella!_t depletion burn.- The propellant depletion burn was\naccomplished\nsuccessfully.\nApproximately\n192 pc,rods of propellant was\nburned.\nThe instrumented chamber and propellant manifo)d pressures\nduring the propellant depletion burn and the helium purge were normal.\nThe oxidizer tank pressure recovered several seconds before the fuel\ntank pressure.\nThis indicated usable oxidizer had been depleted before\nthe fuel.\nApproximately\n14._ pounds of oxidizer remained trapped in\nthe tank and lines of the two systems.\nThe engine chamber pressure\nbuildup during the helium purge indicated at least part of the trapped\noxidizer was burned.\nDuring the Apollo 4 mission, the fuel was depleted\nfirst, leaving i0.5 pounds of usable oxidizer in addition to the trapped\nquantity.\nTo reduce the hazard of the unburned oxidizer damaging the\nparachutes during the Apollo 6 mission, 9 pounds less oxidizer were\nloaded in each system.\nThis oxidizer would have been excess to the required oxidizer for combustion of usable fuel.\n\nThermal\n\n\'.\n\nControl\n\nThroughout the mission, the CM RCS was passively maintained within\nsatisfactory limits.\nThe system withstood the effects of a high heating\nload entry after having been subjected to an extended cold-soak period.\nThe\noxidizer\n_n._9ctor\ntored on\ngas, the\nchamber\nengines\n\ntemperatures of the A and B system helium tanks and six engine\nvalves were monitored throughout the flight.\nDuring entry, the\nte,_erature and two engine outer-wall temperatures were monieach of four engines.\nTo detect any leakage of hot combustion\ntemperature of the interface seal between the ablat:[ve thrust\n\nassembly and ablative nozzle\nwas :monitored during entqy.\n\nextenslon\n\nof the two positive\n\npitch\n\nI\n\ni\n_\n\nJ\n\n2-4]\xc2\xb8\n\n,\n\nThe CM RCS was subjected to cold-soak conditions fc, approxlmately\nr\n6 hours during the coast-ellipse phase. Because the system had r_ceivo0\nside sun exposure during the similar phase of the Apollo 4 missy,on,th:]._\nflight represented the first opportunity to evaluate thermal response of\nthe sys%em after an extended cold-soak period. As expected, when the\nsystem was activated after the cold-soak period the temperatures were\nwel_ below ambient launch temperatures. The cystem A and B helium tanks\ncooled ll* to 12" F, reaching temperatures of approxlmate_v 64_ and _8" F,\nrespectively, _t SM/CM separation\'] These levels are considered to be\nnormal for cold-soak operation and within design limits.\nThe engines were ported through and bonded to the heat shield.\nSubstantial cond_cti\'_eheat losses were experienced by the engines durir_ the cold-soak period. At SM/CM separation, the engine outer-wall\ntemperatures had decreased to the range of -2_* to -2* F, injectors to\n36* to 40* F, and oxidizer valves to 44 to _4\xc2\xb0 F. These temperatures\nwere within design limits prior to activation. However, if Apollo 6\nhad been a manned mission, the crew would have applied current to the\nengine valves prior to entry to increase the injector temperatures to\nabove _8" F.\n\nI\ni\n!\ni\nI\n\n|\n\nDuring the two revolutions prior to OSM/S-IVB separation, the tem.\nperature of the OM ROS heli_u ta_ and oxidizer valve varied only\nslightly from launch temperatures. Temperature data for the engine\ninjectors, outer walls, and chamber/nozzle interface seals were renorded\nby the onboard flight _lallflcatlon tape recorder duri_ the launch and\nentry phases. However, during the first two revolutions, these temperatures should have varied only slightly from launch tempnraturns\n\n.\n\nFrom system activation through landing, the helium tank temperatures\ndecreased normally as a result of @as withdrawal. All of the engine component temperatures increased because of engine firing and aerodynamic\nentry thermal loads. During entry, the negative pitch engines were exposed to the airstream when the apex cover was Jettisoned. The subsequent cooling effect attenuated the temperature increase of the oxidizer\nvalves for these engines. During entry, all measurement parameters\nremained within design limits. No chamber/nozzle interface seal leakage\nwas detected on either of the positive pitch engines.\n\nPostflight Examination\n\ni\n\nI\n\nThe postflight examination of the CM RCS revealed ruptured burst\ndisks in the A system oxidizer relief valve and in the B system fuel\nrelief valve. These ruptured burst disks were characteristic of all\nprevious missions and ground-based test programs. Ruptures were caused\nby a pressure surge or regulator overshoot at system pressurization.\n\nj\n\n4\n\n2\n\n_\n\nmmmnmmm\n\n2-42\n\nThis problem was eliminated on Block II systems by relocating the relief\nvalves to provide more volume between the regulators and relief valves.\nAnother problem was the cross wiring of the oxidizer and fuel valves\n_f all four yaw engines. Cross wiring was found during system decontaminatlon in Kawali, The fuel lead wires and the oxidizer lead wlre_,were\nreversed, This anomaly had no effect on eng_Ineperformance in flight\nbecause the oxidizer and fue]ovalves are w_red In parallel and recelVe a\ncommon command signal.\n\nI\n/\n\nI\n\n2_43\nAPOLLO\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n"\n\n7 (AS _O9/C_qM i01) CSM RCS FLIGHT\n\nPERFORMANCE\n\nApollo 7 was the first manned Apollo mission.\nLift-off occurred\nat 19:0_:4_ G.m.t.

No helLum or propellant leakage was observed from the SM RCS during the flight.\nA total of 87_ pounds of SM RCS propellants was usea during the\nflight. With the exception of the S-IVB rendezvous, propellant consumpt[on approximated the predicted usage. The S-IVB rendezvous required\napproximately ll percent (37 pounds) more than predicted. Swltchover\nfrom primary to _econdary propellant tanks was accomplished at a nominal\nvalue of 43 percent propellant remaining as determinea by ground calculations. At switchover the onboard gage readings were 46 to _4 percent\nprcpellant remaining. The discrepancy between ground calculations and\nonboard gage readings of propellant quantity remaining was caused by an\nend-point error in the quad propellant quantity sensor. Onboard gage\nreadings, when corrected for end-point error and temperature, agreed\nwith ground calculations within 1.7 percent of full scale.\nThermal control of the SM RCS was satisfactory throughout the flight.\nBecause of boost heating, maximum quad package temperatures were ll5\xc2\xb0 to\n128\xc2\xb0 F. The primary beaters on all four quads were activated at orbi.tal\ninsertion and remained on for the remainder of the mission. The primary\nheater system functioned normally and it maintained the quad package\ntemperatures between ll8Q and 143\xc2\xb0 F during periods of low engine firing\nactivity. The maximum quad package temperature attained was 198\xc2\xb0 F during S-IVB rendezvous maneuvers. The primary propellant tank outlet\ntemperatures were initially at approximately 7_\xc2\xb0 F and decreased during\n\xe2\x80\xa2\nthe flight for all quads.

The primary heater system on each quad was activated shortly after orbital insertion. The _ximmn quad package temperatures attained as a result of boost heating were ii_" to 127.5" F.\nThose temperatures were below the maximr_ temperatures (i_8" F) obtalned\ndurlng the Saturn V launches of Spacecraft 017 and 020. Thle resulted\nbocause the Spacecraft I01 launch trajectory was higher and Space_raft\n017 and 0_0 were launched with the primary heaters activated.\nlleatsoakback occurred after all long RCS burns (ulla_e maneuvers,\nphaslng maneuvers, etc.) and following all periods of high engine firing\nactivity. Maximum heat scekback occurred follow:IngCSM S-ICB rendezvous\nat approximately 30:00:00 g.e.t. At this time, s_xlmu_itemperatures of\n196\xc2\xb0 to 198\xc2\xb0 F were reached on quads A and C.\nThe SM RCS propellant quantity was determined by two methods during\nthe flight. The PVT ground computer program utilized pressure, volume,\ntemperature considerations, and was available only on the ground. The\npropellant temperature (P/T) sensor propellant values, which gave propellant quantity as a function of heliumtankpressure\nand temperature,\nwas displayed in the vehicle in terms of percent full scale of a 0 to\nvoltmeter, as well as being telemetered.\nThe PVT program was assumed to be the correct value for propellant\nexpended. The quoted accuracy of this program was \xc2\xb1 6 percent because\nof instrumentation inaccuracies of the inputs to the program, use of\nnominal volumes and propellant loads, O/F ratio shift, and differential\nbetween helium tank and propellant ullage temperatures. The output of\nthe P/T sensor was designed to read i00 percent when the helium tank\npressure was 4150 psia at 70" F, and 0 percent when the pressure was\n22_0 psla at 70" F. The correct theoretical value of helium tank pressure at propellant depletion is 2450 psla at 65\xc2\xb0 F. A nomogram was used\nto correct the P/T sensor readings for this end-point error as well as\nfor compressibility effects, system temperature variability, and propellant vapor pressure effects.\nThe secondary SM RCS propellant tanks contained 38 percent of the\ntotal load. Because of the inaccuracies of the gaging system, the crew\nwas requested to switch from primary tanks to secondary tanks when the\nPVT program indicated 43 percent propellant remaining. Swltchover was\naccomplished by opening the secondary propellant isolation valves and\nclosing the primary propell_r.tisolation valves.\n\nl\n,\'\n\ni\n\n2-93\n\nConnand Module Reaction Control Subsystem\n\n,\n\nPropulsion performance.- Comparison of the actual rates with the\npredicted rates indicated nominal CM propulsion performance.

A single system entry was planned, and system 2\nwas deactivated at 299:49:46 g.e.t. System 2 was subsequently reaotirated at 299:98:30 g.e.t, when the crew heard a loud noise and suspected\nthey had suffered a CM RCS engine malfunction. No malfunction occurred\nand the source of this noise is unknown. The remainder of the entry\nwas made with both systems active.\nHelium pressurization S_/stem...\nThe helium tank pressure drop at\nsystem a_Ct/ivation\nwas 487 pSla f0r system 1 and 464 psla for system 2.\nCalculations have shown this pressure drop is equivalent to a polytroplc\nhelium expansion with an expansion exponent of 1.4. The relief valve\nbu_-stdiscs were not ruptured at system activation.\nPropellant s_stem.- The propellant system functioned normally\nthroughout the flight. No propellant leakage was noted. The system\nwas activated with the propellant isolation valves closed. These\nvalves were opened shortly after system activation. Propellant isolation valves operated normally. Postfllght testing indicated that the\noxidizer isolation valves were damaged, probably at system activation\n(discussed later).\nEngines.- All data indicated proper engine perfors_nce during\nentry. It was estimated a total of 128 seconds of burn time and 829\npulses were accumulated by the 12 engines.\n\n,\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n4\n\n_.,\n\nCM RCS thermal control.- During the flight prior to system activation, the CM RCS helium tank temperatures ranged between 61\xc2\xb0 and 77\xc2\xb0 F.\nThe six CM RCS engine injector temperatures, read by the crew on the\nonboard meter, remained above 46\xc2\xb0 F at all times, and were above 50\xc2\xb0 F\n(upper limit of the meter) at the initiation of entry.

Combinations of manual\nand automatic control and single and dual system firings were used\nduring entry. The propellant expended figures were based on PVT calculations and were verified by engine on-time.\n\nI\n_i_\n\'"\n\n2-54\n\nSpacecraft Deactivation\nThe Space,raft i01CM arrived at Pier 12, Norfolk Naval Air _t_tlon,\nNorfolk, V:[rglnla,0800 October 24, 1968, aboard the U.S.S. Essex. The\nCM was moved to hangar LP-2. The procedures for pyrotechnic evaluation\nwere performed. All the pyrotechnics functioned normally. The non,ally\nunfired pyrotechnics in the RCS were verified and initiators removed\nfrom the squib valves.\nEvaluation of the RCS indicated most of the propellants were onboard and system 2 had a minimum of operational use during the mission.\nApproximately 2.8 gallons of fuel were e_elled from system i and\n4.3 gallons from system 2. Leakage of manual valves in the ground sup_\nport equipment (GSE) was noted during the fuel expulsion operation and\ncorrections were made to eliminate the leaks. The RCS engine valve leak\nchecks were performed to gather information for postfl_ght analysis.\nThese checks indicated that there was no gas leakage through the engine\nfuel injector valves.\nAn accurate volume of the oxidizer remaining in the RCS was not\navailable because of the high boiloff rate of nitrogen tetroxlde.\n\nAnomalies\nTwo anomalies were noted during and after the flight.\n1.\nlaunch.\n\nThe P/T quantity gage for the SMRCS\nCause of this failure is unknown.\n\nquad B failed prior to\n\n2. During postflight testing of the CM RCS relief valve, a high\namount of leakage was o0served through the closed oxidizer propellant\nisolation valves. When voltage was removed, the oxidizer isolation\nvalves opened and the position indicator switch verified the change.\nThe valves are spring loaded closed by a bellows preload and should\nremain closed when voltage is removed. The oxidizer valves were removed and sent to the manufacturer for postflight tests and analysis.\nThe analysis revealed a O.05 to 0.06 inch compression of the poppet\nbellows. This permanent compression of the two poppet bellows and\nresultant reduction in seat load and opening voltage were, evidently,\ncaused by a pressure surge when the CM helium system was activated with\nthe isolation valves in the closed position. There was an an identical\nfailure mode during the early development phase of this valve. The\nintended procedure was to have the valves open at system activation.\nThe fact that the fuel valves did not fail can possibly be explained by\nthe shorter and less dense fluid column between the isolation valve and\nthe propellant tank. The fuel valves were not tested to determine\nwhether degradation had occurred.\n\n&\n\ni\n\nl\n\nCorrective\nactivation.\n\nmajor\n\naction\n\nis to open the isolation\n\nvalves\n\nprior\n\nto system\n\nIt is concluded that the CSM RCS performed as expected in all\nrespects.\nNo \xc2\xa31ight problems \xc2\xa3or future vehicles were identified.\n\nI\n==\n\nlii\n\nI\n\ni\n\n.....\n\ni\n\nii\n\n=\n\n_\n\nn,\n\ni IIi\n\nmill !\n\ni ,,\n\n, ,,,|r ,\n\n,,\n\ni:\n\n_i\n\n!\n,,,;,\n\n_-56\n\nAPOLLO\n\n8 (SPACECRAFT\n\n105) CSM RCS FLIGI_T PERFORMANCE\n\nApollo 8 was the second manned Apollo mission, first manned Saturn V\nmission, and first manned lunar orbital mission.\nLift-off occurred at\n12:51:OO.7 G.m.t. December 21, 1968.\nMission duration was approximately\n147 hours.\nThe spacecraft landed in the mld-Paelflc recovery area at\n15:51:4_ G.m.t. December e7, 1968.\nCrew consisted of _Tank Borman, James\nLovell, and William Anders.\nThis was designated as a "C-prime" type mission.\nThe purpose of the\nmission was to demonstrate the capability of the spacecraft, crew, _nd\n_qFN support facilities to conduct a deep space and lunar orbital mission\nand to _atisfy development and verification test objectives not a_momplished on previous missions.\nVarious data test objectives (DTO) were defined for the CSM RCS.\nThese are covered in detail in the Mission Requirements Document\nSPDS-R027, Revision A, dated December\' 13, 1968.\nBriefly, these DTO were:\n1.\n\nP7.31 - Space Environment\n\nThermal\n\nControl.\n\nThe purpose\n\nof this\n\nDTO was to demonstrate that the, passive thermal control mode of operation\nwas adequate to maintain spacecraft systems and components, including the\nCSM RCS, within acceptable thermal limits,\n2.

All system parameters were within the normal range and no\nflight anomalies occurred. All test objeetlves were satisfied.\n\n\'\n\n-\n\nSM and CM RC8 f_el was loaded November 17, 1968, and oxidizer\nNovember 18, 1968. A total of 1345._ pot_qdsof propellants was loaded\nIn the SM and 245.3 pounds in the CM. The CM loading weight reflects\nthe fact that approximately 18 pounds of oxidizer (9 pounds per CM RCS\nsystem) were off-loaded to prevent raw oxidizer from eontactlr_gthe\nparachutes and risers during\nthe propellant dump operation following\nentry. Helium servicing of the SM and CM RCS was performed December 17,\n1968. The SM RCS quads were serwi.cedto 4120 to 4230 psia helium pres_\nsure. No systems leakage was observed prior to launch. Static firing\nof the SM RCS engines on the pad was not performed.\nThe SM RCS helium pressurization system maintained helium and propellant manifold pressures constant at 181 \xc2\xb1 9 psia. No helium or propellant leakage was observed from the SM RCS during the flight.\nEvaluation of spacecraft body rates indicated normal performance\nof the SM RCS throughout the flight.\nA total of 634 pounds of SM RCS propellants was used during the\nflight. The predicted usage, adjusted for flight plan changes, was\n668 pounds. Switchover from primary to secondary propellant tanks was\naccomplished on all four quads at 139:31:06 g.e.t, when the switchover\npoint of 131 pounds (43 percent) of propellant remaining was reached in\nquads B and D. This percentage was indicated by ground calculations.\nThe onboard propellant quantity gage readings, when corrected for endpoint errors and temperature effects, agreed with ground calculations\nto within \xc2\xb1 7 percent of full scale.\n\nJ\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nIt was estimated that a total of 46 O00 firings of the SM RCS\nengines was made.\nThermal control of the SM RCS was satisfactory during\nthe flight.\nBecause of boost heating, maximum quad package temperatures were 124\xc2\xb0\nto 142\xc2\xb0 F. The primary heaters on all four quads were activated shortl$\n_\nafter insertion and remained on for the remainder of the mission. The\nprimary heater system functioned normally. The quad package maintained\nten_eratures between 118\xc2\xb0 and 142\xc2\xb0 F during periods of low engine firing\nactivity. The maximum quad package temperature attained was approxlmately 185\xc2\xb0 F following the first CSM/S-IVB evasive maneuver at approxImately 05:40:00 g.e.t. The quad heater duty cycles during the passive\nthermal control mode of operation varied between i_ and 30 percent; the\naverage was approximately 29 percent. The SM RCS helium tank temperatures were from 59\xc2\xb0 to 88\xc2\xb0 F throughout the flight.\n\nI\n._\n\n\':\n\n\'i\ni\n\n_-58\n\nPrior to activation, no helium or propellant leakage wa_ noted\nfrom the CM HCf. The systems were aetlvated approxln_tely an hour\nprior to CM/SM separation (149:32:90). Each system was briefly checked\nout by the crew; CM/SM separation occurred at 146:_8:48.9 g.e,t.\nBoth manual and automatle control were used durlr_ entry. Appro_{mutely 20 seconds after CM/SM separation, CM RC_ system 2 was deaetivated. The remainder of the entry was performed uslnM system l, Evaluation of the spaceoraft body ,,atedata indicated that the system\nfunctioned norn_lly. Following deployment of the _m_Inparaehute_, the\nrenninlng CM RCS prop_llantf_were dumped at 146:97:13 g.e,t. Helium\nsystem blowdown and propellant line purge was initiated at 146:98:13\ng.o.t. Approximately _0 gmeonds before landing, the propellant Isolation valve_ w_u\'oolosed at 146:98:49 g.e.t.\nA %oral of 34.7 pounds of CM RCS propellant was used prior to propellant dump (34.1 pounds from system i and 0.6 pounds from system _).\nA total of 829 CM RCS e.n_ine1\'iringswas made.\nThe CM RCS helium tank temperatures remained between 97\xc2\xb0 and 74,\xc2\xb0I,\'\nprior to system activation. The instru_mnted CM RCS engine injectors\nremained above 90\xc2\xb0 at all times. The CM _lve dump warmup procedure\nwas not required.\nSlight (approximately 40 psi{a)pressure was found remaining in the\nCM RCS at deactivation. Unmeasurably small traces of fuel and oxidizer\nwere found.\n,,%,\n\nService Module Reaction Control Subsystem\nSystem configuration.- The Spacecraft 103 SM RCS differed from\nthat of\'preceding and subsequent vehicles in the following respects:\ni. The auxiliary helium pressurization valve in the helium pressurization line _pstream of the secondary fuel tank was not installed\non Spacecraft i01. This valve was included on Spacecraft i03 and subsequent vehicles\'_\n2. Spacecraft i03 and subsequent vehicles incorporated the capabillty to electrically isolate individual SM RCS engines. This capability did not exist on Spacecraft lO1.\n3. Spacecraft 103 and subsequent vehicles incorporated a CM\ncabin display of the SM RCS helium tank ten_erature.

At approximately 12_ hours g.e.t.\nthe quad A \'nellumtank reached a temperature of 88\xc2\xb0 F, which was 2\xc2\xb0 P\nabove the preflight predicted maximum temperature. At the present time\n:Itis unceztain whether th:Lswas caused by adjacent electron:Lcequipment or \'byvehicle orientation effects. This temperature did not\nindicate an unacceptable thermal condition in the spacecraft, however.\nPropellant utilization and quantity gagln_.- Calculations from\npostflight data, the total propellant consumed during the mission was\n63_ pounds. This represented consez_ative usage. Propellant consumptlon was within lO pounds of the predicted prior \'tothe flight. This\nagreement was somewhat accidental. There was wide variance between\nactual and preflight predicted usage du_\'inginitial phases of the misslon because of deviations in the flight plan. Postflight predictions,\naccounting for changes in the flight plan, show favorable agreement\nbetween actual and predicted usage throughout the mission. The predictions are generally within 20 pounds o\xc2\xa3 actual usage and within\n34 pounds of actual usage at the end of the m:Lssion. The SM RCS propellant quantity was determined by two methods during the flight, PVT\nand P/T. The PVT ground computer program utilized pressure, volume,\nand temperature considerations at an average mission mixture ratio\n(M/_-I)of 1.88 to 1.0.\n\nWithin a quoted a(:t:uracyf \xe2\x80\xa2 6 percent because\no\n\n"\n\n_ i\n\n2-61\n\n,\n\n\'\n\nof instrumentation inaccuracies, use of nominal volumes and propellant\nloads, O/F ratio shifts, and the differentia],between helium tank and\npropellant ullage temperatures, the PVT program was considered the best\nestlmate for propellant expended. The pressure temperature (P/T) sensor, which gave usable propellant quantity remaining as a function of\nhelium tank pressure and temperature, was displayed onboard in percent\nand telemetered. The output of the P/T sensor was designed to read\ni00 percent when the hellumtank pressure was 4150 pole at 70" F and\n0 percent when the pressure was 2250 psla at 70_ F. The correct theoretical value of helium tank pressure at propellant depletion was\n2450 psla at 65\xc2\xb0. A nomogram was used to correct the P/T sensor readings for this end-point error, as well as compressibility effects,\nsystem temperature variability, and propellant vapor pressure effects.\nA quad-to-quad comparison of the propellant expended showed that the\nentire mission _as flowu in B and D roll, with A and C roll engines\nInhibited_ Quads B and D propellant usage exceeded the preflight prediction, whereas A and C was slightly less. Quads B and D usage exceeded that of A and C by approximately 68 pounds. All major RCS AV\nburns and ullage maneuvers were four quad Jet firings. Corrected P/T\nreadings on quads A and D are in close agreement with PVT data during\nthe entire mission. Quads B and C show more variance. This was because of an initial bias in each quad at launch. Quad B was initialized at 96.0 percent P/T and quad C at 98.0 percent P/T. Corrected\nfor pressure and temperature variations, these values become 95 percent\nfor B and 96.5 percent for C. With th_s initial bias, both P/T curves\ndiffer from their PVT constituent by a constant amount.\nThe secondary SM RCS propellant tanks contained 38 percent of the\ntotal load. Because of the inaccuracies of the gaging system, the crew\nwas requested to switch to secondary tanks at 43 percent usable propellant remaining, as indicated by the PVT program. Swltchover was\naccomplished at 139:31:56 g.e.t, on all four quads when the switchover\nlimit was reached on quads B and D.\n\nX\nI\n\nCommand Module Reaction Control Subsystem\n\n"\n\nSystem configuration.- The CM RCS system configuration was identical to that of Spacecraft i01. On Spacecraft 104 and subsequent vehicles the fuel and oxidizer tank pressure transducers on each CM RCS\nsystem were relocated from their position downstream of the check\nvalves to the co_-_ion\nhellummanlfoldbetween\nthe regulators and the\ncheck valves.\nPreflight activity.- The CM RCS fuel (NMH) was loaded November 17,\n1968, and CM RCS oxidizer (N204) November 18, 1968. A total of 24_.3\npounds of propellants was loaded into the two system.\nHelium servicing of the CM RCS was accomplished December 17, 1968. To prevent raw\n\nl\n\n2-62\n\nox:[dlzer from contae\'ting the parachutes and risers during the propellant d_p\noperation following entry, approximately 9 pounds of oxidlz(_r\nwere off-loaded from each CM RCS system.\nPrior to launch, no systems\n.leakage was observed.\nInstr_nentation.during\n\nNo CM RCS instrumentation\n\nanomalies\n\noccurred\n\nthe Apollo _-mlsslon.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\nPr\xc2\xb0 p.u.]sion ,\ne_rmance.-...\n,\nThe charaeteri_tie\nlow rates during the\nf:i.r_t\nCM RCS firings after CM/SM separation, which were observed on\nprevious flights and resulted from trapped gas in the i,ropellant lines,\nwere not seen on Spacecraft 105. This is because of the fact that \'the\nCM RC\'S was activated approximately an hour before CM/SM separat:[on\n(at 149: 32.:\'.50\ng.e.t.).\nA series of checkout flrlngs were performed at\nthat time,\nTherefore, the propellant lines were well primed at separat:Lon. The checkout firings cons:[sted of a pos:Ltlve and negative manual\nminimum impulse mode maneuver in each axis and a positive and negat:lw_\nautomatic rate command maneuver in each axis.\nControl of the spacecraft attitude wan returned to the SM RCS at approximately\n149:_4:49\ng .e .t.\nComparison of the actual rates with predicted rates .indicated\nzominal CM RCS propulsion performance.\nBoth manual and automatic control were used during entry.\nBoth systems were active at CM/SM separation; however, system 2 was deactivated approximately 20 seconds\nlater, at 146:29:08 g.e.t.\nThe remainder of the entry was made with\nsystem 1 only.\nThe CM RCS systems\n\nwere activated\n\napproximately\n\nan hour before\n\nCM/SM separation at 149:32:90 g.e.t.\nThe helium isolation squib valves\noperated normally at system activation.\nThe initial heli_um tank pressure drop at system activation for system 1 was approximately\n807 psia\nand for system 2 was 904 psia.\nAfter thermal stabilization, the stable\npressure decrease for systems 1 and 2 was 636 and 692 psia, respectively.\nThe relief valve burst discs were not ruptured at actiw.tion.\nPropellant system.- The propellant system functioned normally\nthroughout the flight.\nNo propellant leakage was noted at any period.\nThe propellant isolation valves were opened prior to systems activation.\nThey sustained no da_mge because of activation.\nDuring the propellant\ndump operation, oxidizer was depleted approximately\n9.9 seconds before\nfuel was depleted.\nThis indicated the adequacy of the 9-pound cxLdizer\noffloaded from each system.\nIt is estimated that approximately\n8.8 pounds of fuel were expell.ed from the systems followi,_ oxidizer\nd._pietion.

The six Instrumented CM RC_ engine injector temperatures, read by the crew on the onboard meter, remained above 50" F (upper limit of the meter) from\nlaunch through CM RCS activation. Conzequently the CM ROB valve warmup\nproo.c_dure,hich was to be used if any injector temperature went below\nw\n_8_ F, was not required. In general, the CM RC_ was o.ompatiblether_lly with passive thermal control and lunar orbital operations.\nPr01_llant utilization.- A total of approximately 34.7 pounds of\npropellant was used from the CM RCS prior to the propellant dump\n(54.1 pounds from system i and 0.6 pounds from system 2).\n\nSpacecraft Deactivation\nOn December 29, 1968 at 0919 the U.S.S. Yorktown docked at Ford\nIsland. The CM was offloaded from the ship and transported to the deactivation site. At ii00 hours the Lan.iingSafing Team (LST) began the\nevaluation of the CM according to the procedure in the Apollo Spacecraft Deactivation Procedures for Landing Safing Team manual. The procedures for pyrotechnic evaluation were performed. All of the pyrotechnics were found to h _e 9m%ctloned normmlly.\nOnly slight traces of fuel and oxidizer as read on the GSE sight\ngage were detected in the spacecraft RCS system. The RCS engine valve\nleak checks and RCS bladder leak checks were not performed.\nSlight residual pressure was found in both CM RCS systems (approximately 40 psia).\ni\n\n\xc2\xb0\n\nBecause laboratory facilities were not aw_ilable to analyze samples,\npurge and flush times were doubled to insure cleanliness and dryness for\npost mission tests at Downey. A new procedure was investigated which\nwould effectively delete the need for laboratory analysis at the field\nsite.\nDuring flush operations, copious leakage of freon and isopropyl\nalcohol occurred around t_ GSE engine throat plugs. Causes for this\nleakage were (i) burnt throats, (2) waste matter in engine throats from\ndrilling during removal of RCS panels on the prlma,recovery ship,\n(3) possible damage to the pitch throats because of improper removal of\nsafety throat plugs on the prime recovery ship, (4) and improperly re-.\nfurbished GSE engine throat plugs.

This test was prompted by the fact that the Spacecraft I01\nCMRCS oxidizer isolation valves were damaged when the systems were\nactivated with the valves in the closed position. On Spacecraft i03 the\npropellant isolation valves were opened prior to CM RCS activation. The\ntest of the Spacecraft 103 valves indicated zero leakage and no damage.\n\np\n\nThe reverse leakage test of the CM RCS fuel and oxidizer check\nvalves waz accomplished in place, per ASHUR 103502, to determine the\nphysical condition of the check valves. This test was prompted by \'the\nfa_t that the Spacecraft lO1 CM RCS ox:[dizercheck valves showed evidence of _orrosion, thought to have been introduced during decontamination procedures. All of the Spacecraft 103 check valve_ showed zero\nleakage except the system 1 primary oxidizer check valve wnlch had a\nreverse leakage of 80 scc/15 seconds (specification value of 3.6 scc/\nhour).\n\nAnomalies\nThe oxidizer check valves in the CM RCS had valve seats made from\nR-88 rubber (nitroso rubber), which was selected because of its compatibility with oxidizer (N204). These check valves were subjected to an\nisopropyl alcohol flushing procedure at the plant of the manufacturer\nas a part of the cleanliness verification program of the component. It\nwas found that an unexplained and nonrepeatable incompatibility exists\nbetween R-88 rubber and isopropyl alcohol. The result of this incompatibility was valve seat tackiness, degradation, and resultant leakage.\nThe out-of-tolerance leakage exhibited during postflight testing by the\nSpacecraft i03 CM RCS system 1 oxidizer check valve was attributed to\nthis cause. Effective on Spacecraft 104 and subsequent vehicles, only\ncheck valves which were not exposed to an isopropyl alcohol flush were\nused.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nIt was concluded that the CSM performed satisfactorily in all respects during the Apollo 8 mission, and that the adequacy of the _ystems\nfor deep space and lunar orbital operations was demonstrated.

The purpose\nof this normally closed valve was to determine when the primary fuel\ntank was empty by a pressure decay in the fuel manifold pressure. When\nthis occurred, the isolation valve (VW valve) should have been opened.\nThis allowed the propellant remaining calculation to be updated to include the known volume of the secondary fuel tank, therefore increasing\nthe accuracy of the measurement.\nA summary of vehicle changes from Spacecraft lO1 to Spacecraft 108\nis presented in table I.\nPrefli6ht activity.- The SM RCS fuel (MMH) was loaded February 4,\n\nI\'_\n\n1969, and oxidizer (N204) February 8, 1969.

The\nvalves were opened prior to CSM/S-IVB/LM docking and remained open for\nthe duration of the mission.\nOpening of the helium isolation valves\nin the pressurization\nllne to the secondary propellant tanks was intended to take place when the fuel _nifold\npressure decreased from\n180 to 190 psla.\nHowever, this did not occur because sufficient propellant was not consumed to deplete the prlmt%ry fuel tank in either of\nthe four quads.\nTo assure propellant would be available for the SM\njettison maneuver, all four VW valves were opened approxi_tely\n3 hours\nprior to CM/SM separation.\n\n,,\n\nEngines.- All perfor_nce\ndata indicated correct engine performance during the mission.\nBecause of a l_ck of complete data coverage,\nit was impossible to determine the exact values for total engine burn\ntime and number of pulses.\nHowever, a rough estimate based on the\nweight of propellant consumed was CO00 seconds total burn time and\n97 000 pulses.\nThis did not include the SM Jettison burn because propellant consumption data were not available after separation.\nThermal\nsatisfactorily\n\ncontrol.-\n\nThe SM RCS thermal\n\nthroughout\n\ncontrol\n\nsystem performed\n\nthe mission.\n\nThe spacecraft was launched with the engine package heaters "OFF"\nfor all four quads.\nShortly after orbital insertion, the primary\nheater system on each quad was activated at approximately\n00:19:00 g.e.t.\nThe maximum_ quad package temperature attained as a result of boost\nheating was i_9 \xc2\xb0 F on quad D.\n\ni\n\nl\n,_\n\ni\n\n2-70\nDuring the transposition and docking period, whilo the quad C\nisolation valves were closed, the four package temperatures reached\nlevels of 209", 196", 173", and 186" F, respoctlvely. The _09" F on\n.quadA was sufficient to trigger the caution and warning switch; however, it was not above the 9.10 F redline.

At the end of the mission, the actual usage of propellant exceeded the pred:[ctedusage by approximately 14.0pounds.\nThe maximum mismatch in propellant expended between the quads was\n_m:Lntainedwithin 39 polmds by selectively varyi_ combinations of one,\ntwo, and four jet roll maneuvers and two and four Jet translation nmneuvers. This was done in an attempt to keep the quads above the SCS\ndeorbit redlines. Late in the mission quads A and C were slightly\nbelow this redline. The last three ullage burns were two jet, quads\nB and D, maneuvers.\nThe SM RCS propellant quantity was determined by two methods during the flight. The PVT ground computer program utilized pressure,\nvolume, and temperature considerations and was available only on the\nground. The P/T sensor, which gave propellant quantity as a function\nof helium tamk pressure and temperature, was displayed in the vehicle\nin terms of percent full scale of a 0 to 9 voltmeter, as well as being\ntelemetered.\n\ni\n\ni\n\nThe PVT program was assumed to be the correct value for propellant\nexpended. The quoted accuracy of this program was \xc2\xb1 6 percent because\nof instrumentation inaccuracies of the inputs to the program, O/F ratio\nshift, and the differential between helium tank and propellant ullage\ntemperatures. The output of the P/T sensor was designed to read\nlO0 percent when the helium tank pressure was 4.190psia at 70" F and\n0 percent when the pressure was 2290 psia at 70_ F.

The location was ,_hangedfrom downstream of the check valves in both the fuel and oxld:Izermanlfold_:to\nupstream of the check valves. This negated the po:;f::;billty deterof\nmlni__ which propellant was depleted first during th_ depletion burn\nbecause the transducer was in the common manlfol_ betw,_enthe two\ntanks and regulators.\nPreflight activity.- The CM RCS fuel (M_)\n\nwas loaded February 4,\n\n1969, and-0x:[dlzer(N204) February 8, 1969. A total of 245.0 pounds of\npropellant was loaded in the two systems. Helium servicing of the CM\nRCS was accomplished February 24, 1969.\nTo prevent raw oxidizer from contacting the parachutes and risers\nduring the propellant depletion burn operation following entry, approximately 9 pounds of oxidizer were offloaded from each CM RCS system.\nNo systems leakage was observed prior to launch.\nInstru2_entation.-No CM RCS instrumentation anomalies occurred\nduring the Apollo 9 mission.\n\n_\n\nPropuls_lonperformance.- Both manual and automatic control were\nused during entry. Both systems were active at CM/SM separation; however, system 2 was deactivated approximately 15 seconds later at\n240:36:18 g.e.t.

Consequently the CM RCS\nvalve warmup procedure, which was to be used if any injector fell\nbelow 28\xc2\xb0 F, was not requized.\nPropellant utilization.- A total of 27.9 pounds of CM RCS propellent was used prior to the propellant depletion burn (27 pounds from\nsystem 1 and 0.5 pound from system ,o).\n\nSpacecraft Deactivation\nOn March 16, 1969, at 0900 hours Eastern Standard Time, the U.S.S.\nGuadacanal docked at pier 12, Norfolk Naval Air Station. The CM was\noffloaded and located in hangar LP-2 at approximately I030 hours. The\nCM ECS fuel deactivation lasted from 1500 March 16, 1969, to 0700\nM_rch 18, 1969. Oxidizer deactivation was accomplished between 1700\nMarch 17, 1969, and 1900 March 18, 1969.\nAlthough a s_ll amount of helium pressure remained, essentially\nno propellants were found in the CM RCS during deactivation. After\npurgir_, the sample of the gaseous nitrogen purge fluid indicated no\ndetectable N2% or MMH. Less than I0 parts per million of flush fluid\n(Fruon TF) were found in the sample from the oxi.d.i.zer\nside.

The protective covers were still intact. All engine, helium, fuel, and oxidizer panels appeared to be in\ngood condition with no visible anomalies.\n\nAnomalies\nFollowing separation from the S-IVB, the crew reported a control\nproblem which had lasted for about 12 minutes during the transposition\nperlod. The crew first noticed a lack of capability for translation\nto the left. The position indicator flags for the qaad C primary and\nsecondary propellant isolation valves and the quad D secondary valves\nwere in the "barber pole" or closed position. The valves were opened\nat approximately 2:51:30 g.e.t, and the system performed normally.\nThese valves had been ope:md during final checks prior to launch, verified to be open during orbital insertion checks by the crew, and were\nverified during a cursory examination of the panel after the Co_mmnder\nand the Command Module Pilot exchanged seats prior to separation from\nthe adapter.\nThe isolation valve magnetically latched open and was springloaded\nto the closed position. The valves were controlled by switches located\non panel 2 which were springloaded to center-off. The four isolation\nvalves in each quad were controlled by one switch.\nPropellant usage data showed all four quad C valves were closed\nand quad D was performing no_%nallybefore the crew reopened the propellant isolation valves. Propellant could be supplied from either the\nprimary or secondary tanks, and only the valve position indicator for\nthe secondary tank was in the "barber pole" position for quad D. Closure of only one of the secondary valves was sufficient to cause the\nindication.\n\n\xc2\xb0\n\nIt was concluded that the valve closure was caused by mechanical\nshock at separation of the command and service modules from the adapter.\nShock tests were performed on several isolation valves and on an assembled quad. These tests were conducted to determine shock load required\nto close the valves and determine the effect of shock loads encountered\nduring separation sequence. The results of individual valve tests indicate 80g with an onset rate of about ii milliseconds up to 140g with an\nonset rate of about 1 millisecond could cause a normal valve to close.\nThe shock at the valve resulting from the pyrotechnic charges used to\nseparate the command and service modules from the adapter has been\n\ni l\n\n2-7J_\n\nestimated to be between 180 and _60M wlth an onset rate be\'tween 0.2\nand 5.0 milliseconds.\nApollo 7 and 8, with the same eonf:[_uration,\ndid not have the p_?oblem.\nResults Of the xnvestia_tlons\nled to the eonelusion that the\nshook eould cause normal valves to elose and, further, that valve\nclosure was not detrimental to the valves.\nSince the hardware was\nshow,_ not detrimentally\naffected, on subsequenL flights the flight\nproe.edures were modified to verify\nexposure to shook environments.\n\nisolation\n\nvalve\n\nindleat:[ons after\n\nIt was concluded that the CSM RCfi l)erformed _at;[ofactorily dur:l.n_\nthe Apollo 9 mission.\nNo new problems requiring actlon on subsequent\nvehleles were Identl lied.\n\n"\n\n!\n4\n\n2-7_\n\nAPOLLO i0 (SPACECRAFT 106) CSM RCS FLIGHT PSRFORMANCE\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\'\n\nApollo i0 was the fourth manned Apollo mission, the third _nned\nSaturn V mission, and the second manned LM mission.

These are covered in detail in the Mission Requirements Document,\nSPD 9-R-037, Change B, dated February ii, 1969. Briefly, these DTO\nwere:\n\ni.

Neither of these\nanomalies affected the operation of the system during entry. Procedural\nchanges were mede to eliminate the possibility of these problems occurring on future flights. All system parameters were non_al during the\nmission and all objectives were satisfied.\nThe SM and CM RCS fuel was loaded April 20, 1.969,and oxidizer\nApril 23, 1969. Approximately 18 polmds of oxidizer (9 pounds per\nsystem) were offloaded from the CM RCS. This was to prevent raw oxidizer from contacting parachutes and risers during the propellant dump\n\nI\n\n2.-76\n\noperation. Inspeetlon of recovered parachutes Indleated no damage because of RCS propellant. Helium servicing of both SM and CM RCS was\nperformed May 13, 1969.

The predleted\nusage of propellant was 890 pounds. The secondary fuel tank helium\nisolation valves on all quads were opened prior to CM/SM separation\nalthough an empty primary tank had not been indicated by a drop :in the\nfuel manlfold pressure.\nAn esti_tte for \'thetotal number of firings for the 16 SM RCS\nengines was 43 000.\nThermal control of the aM RCS was satisfactory throughout the\nflight. The maximum temperature reached because of boost heating was\n150\xc2\xb0 F on quad D. The prilmry heaters on all quads were activated\nshortly after orbital insertion and remained on for the remainder of\nthe mission. During times of low engine activity, the primary heaters\nmaintained temperature between 120= and 142\xc2\xb0 F. The SM RCS helium tank\ntemperatures ranged from 99\xc2\xb0 to leO\xc2\xb0 F.\nBoth manual and automatic control were used during entry. Approximately 9 seconds after CM/SM separation, system 2 was deactivated. The\nremainder of the entry performed using system 1 only. Evaluation of the\nspacecraft body rates indicated normal CM RCS performance.\nA total of 32.9 pounds of CM RCS propellant was used for entry.\nThe remaining 212.4 pounds were burned through the engines during the\ndepletion burn following main parachute deployment. The depletion burn\nstarted at 191:D8\'50 g.e.t, and helium system blowdown and propellant\nline purge was initiated at 191:_9:96 g.e.t. The propellant isolation\nvalves were closed at 192.00:02 g.e.t.\nThe CM RCS helium tank temperatures remained between 54\xc2\xb0 and 75\xc2\xb0 F\nprior to system activation. The inctrumentated CM RCS injectors were\nabove 28\xc2\xb0 F at all times and the CM valve waz_up procedure was not\nrequired.\n\n@\n\ni\n"\n\n;\n\ni\n\n2-77\nService Module Reaction Control Subsystem\nSystem e_.The only dlfferenee between the Spacecraft\n104 and Spacecraft 106 SM RCS wae the secondary heater thermostat\nswitching limits. The switching range was changed from 77\xc2\xb0 to io4 F\n_\nto 120_ to 129o F.\nPreflight activity.- The SM RCS _k_ei(MMH) was loaded April 20,\n\n,\n\n1969,\'and oxidizer (N204) April 23, 19_9. Helium servicing of the SM\nquads was accomplished M_y 13, 1969. No propellant or helium leakage\nwas noted prior to launch.\nThe SM RCS was not static fired on the launch pad.\nInstrumentation.- Prior to launch, four of the manifold pressure\ntransducers were known to have a bias as follows: (i) helium mnifold\nA - minus 8 psi, (2) fuel manifold - plus ii psi, (3) oxidizer manifold B - minus 9 psi, (4) helium manifold D - plus 6 psi. Wlth the\nexception of the quad D helium manifold pressure, these biases seemed\nto be constant for the duration of the mission. The quad D transducer\nbegan to increase approximately 3 days after launch until it reached a\nvalue 12 psi higher than the initial value. Since the fuel and oxidizer\nmanifold pressures did not indicate a coryesponding pressure increase\nand the difference between maximum and minimum helium manifold pressures\non the remaining quads was 9 psi, it is assumed that the transducer\nshifted back to the correct reading.\n\n".\n\nPr._9_ulsionerformance.- The magnitude of the pitch accelerations\n_\nduring +pitch maneuvers was consistently higher than those during the\n-pitch maneuvers for approximately identical vehicle masses. This was\nbecause of the fact that the CSM umbilical was located directly above\nthe -x/-p engine on quad C. This resulted in an effective force reduction of approximetely 20 percent based on theoretical calculated values\nas well as the rate data. All other values indicated nominal performance by all 16 SM RCS engines throughout the mission.\nEngines.- All performance data indicated proper engine performance\nduring the mission. Because of a lack of complete data coverage, it\nwas impossible to determine the exact values for total engine burn time\nand total number of pulses. However, an estimate based on the weight\nof propellant consumed was 1500 seconds total burn time and 43 000 total\npulses. This did not include the SM Jettison burn Oecause propellant\nconsumption data were not available after separation.\nThermal control.- The SM RCS thermal control system performed satisfactorLly throughout the mission.\n\nl\n\n_-78\n\nThe spacecraft was lauz_c,-hed\nwith the engine package heaters "OFF"\non all four quads. Shortly after orbital insertion, the primary heater\nsystem on each quad was activated at approximately 00:]2:40 g.e.t. The\nmaximum quad package temperature attained as a result of boost heating\nwas i_0_ F on qua,/B.\nPropellant utillzatlon and quality gaging.- The SM RCL_propellant\nquantity was rleterminedby two methods during the flight. The PVT\nground computer program utilized pressure, volume, and temperature con_iderations and was available on],yon the ground. The P/T sensor, which\ngave propellant quantity as a function of helium tank pressure and temperature, was displayed :Inthe vehicle in \'termsof percent full se_le of\na 0 to _ voltmeter, as well a_ being telemetered.\n[[\'he\'_I\'\nP\nprogram was assumed to be the correct value for ])repellant\nexpended. The quoted accuracy of this program was \xe2\x80\xa2 6 percent because\nof instrumentation inaccuracies of the Inputs to the program, O/F ratio\nshift, and the differential between helium tank and propellant ullage\ntemperatures. The output of the P/T sensor was designed to read lO0\npercent when the helium tank pressure was 4190 psla at 70\xc2\xb0 F and 0 percent when the pressure was 2290 psla at 70\xc2\xb0 F. The correct theoretical\nvalue of helium tan_ pressure at propellant depletion is 2490 psla at\n65\xc2\xb0 F. To correct the P/T sensor readings for this end-point error as\nwell as for compressibility effects, system temperature variability,\nand propellant vapor pressure effects, a nomogram was used.\n\n....\n\nCo_mmnd Module Reaction Control Subsystem\nS[stem configuration.- This system differed from the Spacecraft lO1\nand 103 configurations in the location of the low pressure heliLuumanifold pressure transducer. The locatlon was changed from downstream of\nthe check valves in both the fuel and oxidizer manifolds to upstream of\nthe check valves. This negated the possibility of determining which\npropellant was depleted first during the depletion burn, because the\ntransducer was in the common manifold between the two tanks and regulators.\nPreflight activity.- The CM RCS fuel (MMH) was loaded April 20, 1969,\nand RCS oxidizer (No04) April 23, 1969. A total of 24h._ pounds of propellants was loaded-in the two systems. Helium servicing of the CM RCS\nwas accomplished May 13, 1969.\nApproximately9 pounds of oxidizer were offloaded from each CM RCS\nsystem to prevent raw oxidizer from contacting the parachutes and risers\nduring the propellant depletion burn operation followi_ entry.\nApproxi.mately3.9 days prior to launch, a decrease of 0.i_ ps:l/hr\nwas noted In the system 1 hellum manifold pressure. A check of the\n\n.\n\n\xc2\xb0\n\nI\n\n!\n_\n\n2-79\n\n\'\n\npressures in variou_ portions of the system indicated 47 psia in the\noxidizer tank, 33 psla in _,he fuel tank, and _ psJa in the helium manifold where the spacecraft transducer was located.\nThe check valves,\nlocated between the pressure transducer and the propellant tanks, had\na nominal cracking pressure of 2 psi, and therefore could account for\nthe difference between manifold and tank pxessures.\nThis pressure\ndistrlbution\nlocated the leak downstream of the check valves In th_\nfuel leg.\nThe size of the propellant leak required to produce the established\npreusure decay, snd the fact that propellant vapors could not be de..\ntested, i_olated the leak in the helium system between the check valves\nand the fuel ,nnifold.\nA mass spectrometer leak check of the entire\nny_:\'tem(beth preflight and postflight)\nfailed to locate the leak.\nThe\nsystem\nwas repressurlzed\nto 49 psla approx:l._ately 31 hours prior\nto\nlaunch.\nA_ d:Iseussed In anomalies, the leak rate decreased durln_ the\nmission and led no adverse effect on the operation of the system during\nentry.\nWhen the CM RCS propellant isolation valves were opened approximately lO hours prior to launch, the system 2 helium manifold pressure\ndropped from 44 to 37 psia.\nCalculations showed that a pressure drop\nof this _mgnitude would be expected if the oxidizer burst disk was ruptured.\nOxidizer would flow from the tank into the manifold when the\nisolation valves were opened.\nIt was decided to launch with the ruptured burst disk and vent the\noxidizer from the lines through the engines after orbital insertion.\nPropulsion performance .- The CM RCS was used in the minimum impulse\nmode almost entirely prior to 400 000 foot altitude during entry and the\naerodynamic disturbances.\nThe rates associated with these short firings\nwere too small to allow reasonable ar_ular acceleration\ncalculations.\n\n,,\n\'\n\nHowever, overall inspecticn of the vehicle\nindicated nominal system performance.\n\n,\n\nsystems were active at CM/SM separation.\nHowever, system 2 was deactivated approximately 9 seconds later at 191:34:39 g.e.t.\nThe remainder\nof the entry was made using system 1.\n\nBoth manual\n\nand automatic\n\ncontrol\n\ndynamics\n\nwere used during\n\nduring\n\nentry.\n\nentry\n\nBoth\n\nHelium pressurization\nsystem.- The CM RCS pressurization\nsystem\nfunctioned normally throughout the flight.\nThe system 1 helium manifold\npressure decreased from 44 to 20 psla because\' of a helium leak.\nThe\nsystem 2 helium manifold pressure ranged from 39 to 57 ps:ta because of\nthern_l changes and indicated no system leakage.\n\nI\n\nI\n.!\nIi "\n\n2-80\n\nApproximately 29 minutes before CM/SM separation, the CM RCS systems were activated at 191:04"33 g.e.t. The helium isolation squib\nvalves operated normally at system aetlvation. The initial helium tank\npressure drop at system aetlvation for system i was approximately\n850 psia and system 2 was 840 psla. After thermal stabilization th_\nstable pressure decrease for systems I and 2 was 700 and 720 psia, respo_ctively. Tilerelief valve burst disks were not ruptured at antlvatlon.\npropellant sys.tem.-The prop_llant system functioned normally\nthroughout the flight. No propellant leakage was noted. The propellant\nisolation valves were opened prior to systems activation. Because of\nthe location of the low pressure helium manifold pressure transdu_.ers,\n:Itwa_ not possible to determlne whleh propellant depleted first during\nth_ depletion burn. However, Inspection of the parachutes and suspens:[on\nllnc_ showed no damage because of oxldizer contact. Also, the crew repo_ted they did not s_e the red cloud generally associated with unburned\nox[dlzer. The cre_ did observe the engine ablative material burning\nafter the depletion burn. This is a normal occurrance which results\nfrom a hot ablative chamber following a long firing.\nApproximately 3 minutes prior to landing, the CM RCS propellant\nisolation valves were closed at 192:00:O2 g.e.t.\nEngines.- All data indicated proper engine performance during the\nentry. Exclusive of the steady state propellant depletion burn lasting\napproximately 70 seconds, a total of lOl.180 seconds of burn time and\n54_ pulses was accumulated by the L9 CM RCS engines.\n\n,,\n\nThermal control.- The CM RCS helium tank temperatures ranged between\n_o and 7p\xc2\xb0 F from launch through system activation. The CM RCS valve\nwarmup procedure, which was to be used if any injector fell below 28 \xc2\xb0 F,\nwas not required. The system 1 negative yaw injector temperature reached\n30\xc2\xb0 F at approximately 177 hours g.e.t. The remaining five instrumented\ninjectors temperatures remained between 42\xc2\xb0 and 50\xc2\xb0 F.\nPropellant utilization.- A total of 32.5 pounds of CM RCS propellant\nwas used prior to the propellant depletion burn.\n\nSpacecraft Deactivation\n\ni\n_\n\ni\n\nOn May 31, 1969, the U.S.S. Princeton docked at Ford Island. The\nCM was offloaded and located in hangar 79. The CM RCS fuel and oxidizer\ndeactivation lasted for approximately 50 hours beginning May 31 and ending June 2, 1969.\n\nI\n\ni,\n\n2-81\n\nAfter purging, the sample of the gaseous nitrogen purge fluid\nIndicated no detectable N202 or MMH, The samples from the oxld_zer\nside of systems i and 2 indicated 43 and 28 ppm of flush fluid (freon TF),\nrespeetlvely. The samples from the fuel _Ide of systems 1 and 2 indlcared 1600 and 1800 ppm of flush fluid (isopropyl alcohol), respectively.\n\n@\n\nThe postfllght examination revealed that the CM RCS relief valve\nbur_t disks were not ruptured. The protective covers were still Intact.\nAlso, all en4_ine,helium, fuel, and oxidizer panels appeared to he in\nt_oodeond :l.tion.\nAfter the _M was returned\nto NR, Downey, \xc2\xa2.alllornla,th_ _CS wa_\n_ub.leetedto extensive leak checks in an attempt to l_mate the helium\nloah In system 1. Leak checks were conducted at 90 and 289 psla but th_\n].oakwas not detected. Because the system had been subjected to deoctlvatlon procedures, it is possible that the "wetted" system or the qulek\ndisconnect actuations caused the leak to stop.\n\nAnomalies\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nComma_d module s,vstem1 helium leak.- After helium servicing,\nn\n_.9 days prior to launch, the system 1 helium m_nifold pressure in the\nCM RCS began to decay at 0.14 psi/hr. After approximately 2.9 days, the\npressure upstream of the check valves had dropped from 49 to 39 psia.\nThe pressure in the helium manifolds between the propellant tanks and\ncheck valves was checked. The oxidiser side was at the initial pressure\nof _7 psia, but the fuel side.was 33 psla. Neither a helium leak or a\nfuel leak could be detected. The possibility that a fuel leak of this\nmagnitude could go undetected was unreasonable. Therefore, it was concluded that the leak was in the low pressure helium manifold in the fuel\nleg, that it was not an indication of a serious problem, and that the\nrate would not increase during launch or during the mission, and could\nbe accepted. The sjstem was repressurlzed to 49 psia prior to launch.\nThe leak rate decreased as the mission progressed, reaching 0.04\npsi/hr prior to activation. This decrease can be partially attributed\nto the reduced sy.stempressure. Thus, the leak must have partially\ncorrected itself or the properties of the leaking media changed. The\nhelium in the propellant ta,Lksand m_nlfolds normally becomes diluted as\npropellant permeates the bladder.\n\ni\n\nAt both 90 and 289 psla, postflight testing of the CM included a\nthorough mass spectrometer leak check on system 1. No leaks were detected. Postfiight decontamination procedures, however, would tend to\neliminate certain types of leaks because the quick disconnects were\nactuated during these procedures and the system was wet with flush fluid.\n\ni\'\n_\n\n. .\n\nmm\n\n_-_2\n\nAbout 50 days prior to flight, for subsequent missions, a pad\npressure of lO0 psla was put into the system.\nThis Insured that leaks\ncould be detected earlier in the count and repaired before launch.\n\nJr /\n\n\'\n\nRul_tured l_rol0ellantburst disk.- When the propellant isolation\nvalves in the CM RCS were opened about i0 hours prior to launch, system 2 helium manifold pressure dropped from 4)+ to 57 psi.a. A pressure\ndrop of this magnitude would be expected if the oxidizer burst disk\nwas ruptured and. allowed oxidizer to flow from the tank l.nto the oxld:l\n_er manifold.\n%\n\nThe [zolatlon valve and burst diuk were redundant tier:Lees.

This pressure drop confirmed the venting procedure\nhad been effective and manifold was empty.\nAfter the mission, the oxidLzer and fuel burst, disks were similar\nin physical appearance.\nThis indicates the oxidizer bul-st disk had\nfailed because of pressures in the flow directLon, not because of corrosLon or reverse pressure.\nAppropriate\ncaution notes were added to the prelaunch checkout\nprocedures to establish the steps when the allowable limits on the\nburst disk (241 + 16 psid in the flow direction and l0 psid in the\nreverse direction) could be exceeded.\nAlso, to detect a similar problem in the future, a leak check of the burst disk was added late in the\nlaunch site test flow.\nIt was concluded that the CSM RCS performed satisfactorily\nin all\nrespects duriA_E the Apollo i0 mission.\nAll new problems requiring\naction on subsequent vehicles were corrected.\n\nI\ni\n\nI\n\nI\nI\n\n2-83\n\nAPOLLO\n\nii (SPACECRA_f\n\n107) CSM RCS FLIGE._ PERFORMANCE\n\nApollo Ii was the fifth\nmanned Apollo mission, fourth manned\nSaturn V mission, third in_nned LM mission, and first manned lunar landing mission.\nLift-off occurred at 13:3e:00G.m.t.

The CM valve warmup procedure was not required.\n\nPreflight Activity\n"\n\nThe SM RCS fuel (MMH) was loaded June 18, 1969, and oxidizer (N_O4)\nJune 22, 1969.\n1969.\n\nHelium servicing of the SM quads was accomplished July Ii,\n\nNo helium or propellant leakage was detected prior to launch.\n\nAlthough data were not available for this period, prelaunch flight\ndata indicated that the magnitude of the pitch rates during +pitch maneuvers was consistently higher than those during the -pitch maneuvers\nfor identical vehicle mass. This was because of the fact that the CSM\numbilical was located directly above the -x/-p engine on quad C. This\nresulted in an effective force reduction of approximately _0 percent\nbased on theoretical calculated values as well as the rate data. All\nother rates indicated nominal performance by all 16 SM RCS engines\nthroughout the mission.\n\n,\n\ni\n\n,\n\n2-8_\nService Module Reaction Control Subsystem\nPropellant feed system.- With the exception of one anomaly, the SM\nRCS propellant feed system functioned normally throughout the mission.\nNo indication of propellant leakage was noted. During CSM/S-IVB/LM\nseparation, the primary and secondary propellant isolation valves on\nquad B inadvertently closed. This is discussed in the spacecraft deactivation section. The valves were opened by the crew approximately 29 seconds after separation and remained open for the duration of the mission.\n,\n\nOpening of the helium isolation valves in the pressurization line\nto the secondary propellant tanks was intended to take place when the\nfuel manifold pressure decreased from 180 to 190 psia. However, this\ndid not occur. Not enough propellant was consumed to deplete the primary fuel tank in either of the four quads. All four valves were\nopened approximately 3 hours prior to CM/SM separation to assure that\npropellant would be available for the SM Jettison maneuver.\n\nJ\n\nEngines .- All performance data indicated proper engine performance\nduring the mission. Because of a lack of complete data coverage, it\nwas impossible to determine the exact values for total engine burn time\nand total number of pulses. However, an estimate based on the weight of\npropellant consumed is 1900 seconds total burn time and 40 000 total\npulses. This does not include the SM Jettison burn because propellant\nconsumption data were not available after separation.\nDuring the mission the thermal control system operated norm_lly\nexcept for periods of high engine activity. The heaters cycled normally\nbetween 119\xc2\xb0 and 146\xc2\xb0 F.\n\n......\n\nCo-m_nd Module Reaction Control Subsystem\n\'\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nSystem configuration.- _nls system had not been changed since\nSpacecraft 104 and differed from the Spacecraft lO1 and 103 configurations in the location of the low pressure hellummanlfold pressure\ntransducer. The location was changed from downstream of the check\nvalves in the fuel and oxidizer manifolds to upstream of the check\nvalves. This negated the possibility of determining which propellant\nwas depleted flr_t during the depletion burn, because the transducer\nwas then in the common manlfold between the two tanks and the regulators.\nPreflight activity.- A total of 249.9 pounds of propellants was\nloaded in the two systems. Approximately 9 pounds of oxidizer were offloaded from each CM RCS system to prevent raw oxidizer from contacting\nthe parachutes and risers during the propellant depletion burn operation\nfollowing entry. No systems leakage was observed prior to launch.\n\ni\n\n!\n_\n_J\n\n"\n\n2-86\n\nInstr._mentation.-No CM RCS instrumentation anomalies occurred\nduring the Apollo llmisslon.\nPropulsion performance.- Approximately 9 minutes after deactivating system 2, the crew determined that the -yaw thruster was producing\nnear zero thrust in response to automatic coll co_ands.\nProper response was restored when the direct coils activated by the rotation\nhand controller were used. Operation in this mode provided two engine\ncontrol authority, although system 2 circuit breakers were open. As\ndiscussed in the spacecraft deactivation section, the valve failure\nwas traced to a faulty tennlnal board connector in the circuit for the\nautomatic coll of the oxidizer valve. All other data indicated nominal\nCM RCS performance.\n\n.\n\nBoth manual and automatic control were used during entry. Both\nsystems were acJ.ve at CM/SM separation. However, system 2 was deactivated approximately 69 seconds after CM/SM separation. System 1 was\nused for the remainder of the entry.\nHelium pressurization system.- The CM RCS systems were activated\nat 19_:16:22 g.e.t., which was approximately 33 minutes before CM/SM\nseparation. The helium isolation squib valves operated normally at system activation. The initial helium tank pressure drop at system activation for system 1 was approximately 720 psia and system 2, 770 psia.\nAfter thermal stabilization, the stable pressure decrease for systems 1\nand 2 was 580 and 610 psia, respectively. Postflight inspection verified\nthe relief valve burst disks were not ruptured at activation.\n4,\n\n\',\n\nEngines.- All data indicated proper engine performance during entry,\nalthough data were not available to determine total engine on-tlme and\nnumber of pulses. An estimate of 220 seconds and 750 pulses was made,\nbased on total propellant consumption and previous exposure time. This\nwas exclusive of the steady state propellant depletion burn which lasted\napproximately 60 seconds.\nThermal control.- The CM RCS helium tank temperatures rar_ed between 56\xc2\xb0 and 72\xc2\xb0 F f:comlaunch through system activation. The six instrumented CM RCS engine injector temperatures, read by the crew on the\nonboard meter, remained approximately 50\xc2\xb0 F (upper limit of the meter)\nfrom launch through CM RCS activation. The CM RCS valve warmup procedure, which was to be used \xc2\xa3f any injector temperature went below 28\xc2\xb0 F,\nwas not requLred.\n\n\xc2\xb0\n\nI\n\ni\n\n2-87\n\nSpacecraft Deactivation\n\n.\n\nThe spacecraft arrived at Ford Island, Hawaii, July 26, 1969, and\ndeactivation procedures began. Although a small amount of hellumpressure remained in the oxidizer system, essentially no propellants were\nfound in the CM RCS during deactivation. The postflight examination\nrevealed the CM RCS relief valve burst disks were not ruptured. The\nprotective covers were still intact. Also, all engine, helium, fuel,\nand oxidizer panels appeared to be in good condition.\n\n4\n\nAnomalies\nSM propellant isolation valve closure.- The propellant isolation\nvalves on quad B of the SM RCS closed during CM/SM separation from the\nS-IVB. A similar problem was encountered on the Apollo 9 mission.\nTests after Apollo 9 indicated a valve with normal magnetic latch forces\nwould close at shock levels of 87g with an ll-millisecond duration.\nHowever, with durations in the expected range of 0.2 to 0.5 milliseconds,\nshock levels of 670g would not close the valves. The expected range of\nshock is 180 to 260g.\nTwo valves of nominal latching force of 7 pounds were selected for\nshock testing. It was found that shocks of 80g for i0 milliseconds to\nshocks of IOOg for i millisecond would close the valves. The latching\nforces on the valves were then mechanlcally reduced to 5 pounds and\nwere retested. The shock required to close the valves at this reduced\nlatching force was 54g for lOmilliseconds and 75g for i millisecond.\nAfter completion of the shock testing the valves were examined and\ntested. No degradation was noted.\n\n@\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n/\\\n*\n\nA review of the checkout procedures indicated the latuhing force\ncould be degraded only when the procedures are not correctly implemented.\nIncorrect implementation would be the application of reverse current or\nac voltage to the circuit. For Apollo 12, a special test indicated that\nthe valve latching force waL not degraded.\nBecause there was no valve degradation when the valve was shocked\nclosed and the crew checklist contained precautionary information concerning these valves, no further action was necessary.\nCM automatic coil failure.- The -yaw engine in CM RCS system 1 produced low and erratic thrust in response to firing commmnds through the\nautomatic coils of\'the engine valves. Spacecraft rates verified that\nthe engine performance was normal when fired by using the direct coils.\nElectrical continuity through at least one of the parallel automatic\ncoils in the engine was evidenced by the fact that the SCS driver signals\n\nI\n\n"\n_\n_\'\n\n2-88\n\nwere norm_l. This, along with the fact that at least some thrust was\nproduced, _nd_eated that one of the two valves was working normally.\nDuring checkout at the launch site, another engine failed to respond\nto commands during the valve signature tests. The problem was isolated\nto a faulty terminal board connector. This terminal board was replaced\nand the systems re-tests were satisfactory. Because of this incident\nand the previous history of problems with the terminal boards, connectors\nwere a prime suspect.\nPostflight tests showed two pins in the terminal board were loose.\nThe loose pins caused intermittent continuity to the automatic coils of\nthe engine valve. This failure had been noticed on terminal boards manufactured prior to November 1967. This board was manufactured in 1966.\nThe intermittent contact was caused by improper clip position relative to the bus bar counterbore. This resulted in loss of some side\nforce, which precluded proper contact pressure against the bus bar. A\ndesign change to the base gasket was made to positively insure that the\nbus bar was correctly posltloned.\nIt was concluded that the CSM RCS performance was satisfactory in\nall respects during the Apollo ll mission. No new problems requiring\naction on subsequent vehicles were identified.\n\n2-89\nC_CL_IO_\n\nIt was apparent from the successful operation of the RCS on the\nApollo flights there were no insurmountable engineering problems encountered during CSM RCS development. In retrospect, however, there\nwere certain problems that were con_on to the development of many of\nthe components. The problems were:\n\ne\n\n1. Component functional design specifications were often initially\nmore stringent _han necessary because actual requirements were not known.\nAs requirements became better defined there was a hesitancy to relax the\nspecification, resulting in some unnecessary, and, perhaps, unproductive\neffort. It was recomended that effort be expended in trying to define\nrequirements accurately as early as possible. Additionally, when a\nrelaxation in requirements became evident it was recommended that the\nspecification be relaxed if cost or schedule savings could be realized.\n\n,\n\n._ , _\n\n@\n\n"\n\n!\n\n2. Compatibility of the system/components with the propellants was\na recognized problem early in the Apollo development program. A problem\nnot evidenced until considerably later in the program involved conTpatibility of the system/components with the flush fluids or combinations of\nflush fluids and propellants. It was recommended when material compatibility of the system/components with fluids was established that it include all fluids and _Ixtures of fluids that might be introduced into\nthe system. It was also recommended that particular attention be given\nto determining what fluids and materials could be used during "manufacturing" and "checkout" of the system. Provisions for adequate drying should be made when fluid m4xlng cannot be tolerated.\n5. Because of the many small orifices and the close tolerances on\nmoving parts, cleanliness control became an ever increasingly evident\nproblem as the program progressed. At best, it was difficult to assemble\na clean system, The need for component removal and replacement further\naggravated the problem. To minimize the problem, filters were added to\nthe system to protect components that had an unusually high failure rate\nbecause of contamination. It was recomended that on future programs all\ncomponents be designed as insensitive to contamination as possible. Additionally, where contamination sensitive components cannot be avoided, it\nwas recommended that the co_onent be protected by integral filters built\ninto the components. It was also reco_ended that if fluids are reverse\nflowed through any component during flushing or filling operations, consideration should be given to protecting both inlet and outlet ports on\nthe component. _Instream filters should be considered in addition to\nthe integral component filters if large quantities of contaminates are\nantJ.cipated.\n\n--\n\n|\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n_.\n..;\n\n2-90\n\n4. A considerable number of unnecessary and costly situations\narose during the development and qualification testing because the production of components was well underway before the testing programs were\nmompleted. This was particularly true with the system level tests.\nCorrective action for problems uncovered during these programs almost\nalways involved retrofitting production units and mud lfylng completed\nsystems. Some problems were simply lived with because of the extensive\nvehicle rework required to correct the situation. 0nly limited ehangcs\nwere made to the systems as a result of these late tests, thus the test\nresults did little to develop better, more reliable systems, but rather\nwere only confidence builders. It was recommended that every attempt\nbe made to integrate the test program schedules with the master production schedule_ so that these situations would not develop, or are at\nleast would be minimized.\n\n*\n\n.\n\ne\n\nSECTION 3\nCOMPONE_T FAILURE HISTORY\n\n{\n\n&\n\nJ\n\nJ\n\n_--\n\n-\n\n\' .......\n\n_\n\n_\'_\'"-\n\n.[_,__-:-\n\n.---"\n\n:_\n\nIN\'it\n\nI[\n\n2\n\n.\n\n_::\n\n-\n\n"\n\n"\n\n"--\'lOlL-\n\n-\n\nI1[\n\n"|\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nt\n\nI\n\n3-1\n\nIEwI_ODUCTION\n\nI\n\nThis section _raphieally presents the historical record of component failures in the Cow_and and Service Modules Reaction Control\nSystems.

The pressure vessel has a mind,hum\nwall thickness of O.132 inch after m_chinin_. A mounting provision is\nlocated at the "pole" of each hemisphere. When the pressure vessel\nis installed, one side is fixed and the other side is free to move\nalong the mount axis only, allowing for tank expansion and contraction. The combinationinlet and outlet port is located on the\nmount centerline at the fixed end. The inlet-outletport is a\nmachined boss containinga 7/8-14 UNF-3A external thread and a\nstandard AND IOO50-A internal port. The machined mounting boss at\nthe free end also contains a standardAND IO050-A internal port.\n\n_en\n\nthe pressure vessel is assembled in the reaction control\n\nsystem, a pressure transducer is installed in the port at the free\nend and a stainless steel adapter is installedin the inlet/outlet\nport.\n.,,\n\nThe adapter is a thick-walledtube with a flange and an\n\nAND i0056-_ male end.

When the pressure reaches\nthe preset operatin_ lewl, the b_llows will have been compressed\nsufficientlyto allow the pilot poppet to close. The pressure on\nthe actuating piston is bled off through the drilled passage,\nequalizing the pressure on both sides of the piston. This allows\n\n_\'\n\nthe spring to reseat the main poppet, which stops the flow of gas\nthrough the regulators. As propellants are consumed, the pressure\nin the manifold decreases, allowing the bellows to expand, unseat\nthe pilot poppet, and start another operating cycle.\nThe regulator unit is supplied in two models.

On\xc3\x99 end _f the cover\nis welded to the base assembly housing; the oth_r end is wo]dod to a\nheader assembly which consists of five gold plated eloctrlcal contacts install_d in a stainless steel plato _nd insu_afied\nfrom the\nplate by F,\nlaoo inou_tion.\n\nThe electrical le_do from the coils and\n\nthe switch are connected to the inboard end of the contacts. Zenor\ndiodes, used for arc suppression,are connected in p_rallel with the\ncoil leads. The wires in the valve cable assembly arc connected\nto the outboard ends of the contacts. The cable is tied to the\nvalve by a teflon grommet which is placed thru the header assembly.\nAll electrical connectionsare encapsulatedwith a silicone rubber\npotting compound.\nThe plunger is actuated with a maximum pull-in voltage of 18\nvolts de.\n\nRCS current wall not exceed 2,5amperes at 30 volts d.c.\n\nIn the closed position, the poppet is held against the seat by the\nnet spring force of two loaded springs.

Each check valw\nelement consists of a poppet assembly, a stainless steel poppet\nguide, a poppet spring, and a stainless steel spring retainer.\nThe poppet assembly is composed of a stainless steel poppet, and\na rubber seal. The rubber seal _EPR) is molded and machined in place\nin a groove in the poppet for the fuel check valves. The oxidizer\ncheck valves employ a rubber washer (Resistazine88) held in place\non each poppet with a retaining ring and kynar nut.\nThe poppet assembly stem is installed in the poppet guide\nwhich is brazed to a shoulder in the valve body forging. The poppet\nseat is a machined conical surface which is an integral part of\n\n#\n\nthe valve body. The poppet\n\n"\n\nassembly has a conical shaped top,\n\nwhleh isat theconical in shape with upon by the poppet spring\nrolmded also apex, which is acted a rounded apex. The forward\nretainer\n\ni\n\n_r\n\ni\n_,\n\nend of the poppet spring pushes against the retaine_"\nand holds the\npoppet against the seat. The aft end of each of the upstream poppet\nsprings is restrainedby a stamped ring on the underside of a thin\n|i_\n\n1\n\nwalled\n\ncup which\n\ndownstream\npart\n\nof\n\npoppet\nthe\n\noutlet\n\nis\n\nwelded\n\nto the\n\nsprings\n\nis\n\nport\n\nassembly\n\nbody.\n\nrestrained\ncap.\n\nThe\n\naft\n\nend of\n\nby a _chinod\nThe outlet\n\neach\n\nboss\n\nport\n\nof\n\nthe\n\nwhich\n\nis\n\na\n\nassembly\n\nconsists of a one-quarter inch O.D. stainless steel tube welded to\nthe stainless steel cap.\n\nThe cap is welded to the body.\n\nThe four check valve elements are identical in design; however,\nthe poppet spring, of the upstream elements are cylindrical and the\ns\npoppet sprin_s of the downstream elements are conical.\n\nThe check\n\nvalve elements are.installed at angles to each other to preclude\nthe possibility of two elements h_ving the same resonant frequency\nwhen subjected to vibration.\nWhen equal pressure exists at the inlet and outlet ports, and\nthe pressure is slowly increased at the inlet port, one of the\nparallel upstream poppets will open when the product of the inlet\npresm_re increase and the poppet seat area exceeds the spring force\nagainst the poppet.\nalmost simultaneously\n\nThe second parallel upstream poppet will open\n(only the normal tolerance variations in the\n\nseat area and spring force will cause differences).\n\nAs the inlet\n\npressure is increased, the remaining two poppets will open almost\nsimultaneously.\n\nWhen the inlet pressure exceeds the outlet pres-\n\nsure by a maximum of 5 psig, all four poppets will be open and flow\nthrough each flow path will be approximately equal.\n\ni\n\nDecreasing the\n@\n\ninlet pressure below the differential pressure required to overcome the spring force will first allow the spring force on each of\nthe downstream poppets to drive the poppet toward its closed position\n\ni\n\nuntil reseat occurs and then allow the upstream poppets to reseat.\n\nk\n\n17\n-2\n\ni\n\nWhen there is greater pressure at the outlet port than at the inlet\nport, all the poppets tend to seat with a force which increases\ndirectly as the increase in the differential\nThe important performance\n\npressure.\n\ncharacteristics\n\nof the check valw\n\nand general information concerning the component are listed below.\nWorking pressure\n\n180 - 302 psig\n\nCracking pressure\nUpstream poppets\nDownstream poppets\n\n0.2 to _ psid\n1.0 to 5.0 psid\n\nPressure drop\nNormal\n\nOne path closed\n\n5.0 psi at a He flow rate\nof 0.09 pounds per minute\nand an inlet pressure of\n180 psig\n6 psi at a He flow rate\nof 0.09 pounds per minute\nand an inlet pressure of\n180 psig\n\nProof pressure\n\n5_0 psig\n\nBurst pressure\n\n720 psig\n\nMaximum external leakage\n\n....\n\n5 x 10-6 std. cc/sec.\n\nMaximum internal leakage\nSinle poppet element\nTwo poppet elements in parallel\n\n5 x 10-5 std. cc/sec.\ni x IO-A std. cc/sec.\n\nNumerical reliability (maximum\nprobability of failure)\nMinimum total operating life\n.\n\ni x 10-6 per i hour\n8000 cycles\n\nSpecification number\n\nMC28A-O02_\n\nSCD number (NR part number)\nQualified oxidizer-side valve\n\n_E28_-0357-O001\n\nI\n\nQualified fuel-side valve\nPre-qualifiedoxidizer-sidevalve\nPre-qualifiedfuel-side valve\nPre-DVT oxidizer-sidevalw\nPre-DVT fuel-side valve\nSupplier\n\nME28&-0357-0002\nME28&-002A-O001\nME28_-002_-0011\nME28_-0024-0003\nME28_-002_-0013\nAccessory Product_ Co.\nDivision of Textron, Inc.\nWhittier, Calif.\n\nSupplier\'spart number per SCD\ndash number 0357-0001\n0357-0002\n002_-0001\n00_-0011\n\n0024-OOO3\n002_-0013\n\n219000\n219100\n214000P\n214100P\n\n21AOOOX\n2_lOOX\n\nTITLE\n\nSeries Parallel Check Valve (APCO)\n\nPART NUMBER\n\nME28/+-OO2&-O022\n\n(oxid)\n\nME28_-0024-0052\n(fuel)\nME28_-O357-0001\nME28_-O357-0002\n\n(ox)\nw/filters\n(fuel) w/filters\n\nDVT COMPLETED\n\nNo DVT\n\nQUAL COMPI_TED\n\nJanuary 1966 (ME28_-002_ ONLY)\n\nDE_/BLOPMENT TEST\nCONPI.ETg]D\n\nMay 1967 (ME28&-O357 ONLY)\n\nNUMBER UNITS TEST_D\n\nA (_28A-OO2A\n\nQUAL TESTS\n\n(ME28&-OO2& ONLY)\nSurge pressure\n308 psig in i0 ms\nAcceleration\n20g \'s\nVibration\n.15 g2/cps at 80 cps\nEndurance\nAO00 cycles - 65\xc2\xb0F to +ISO\xc2\xb0F\n\nONLY)\n\nFluid Compatibility 30 day exposure ambient to\n150\xc2\xb0F N20& and UDrR/N2H A vapor\nContamination - Deterioration\nDisassembly\nDEVELOP_"NT TESTS\n\n(ME28_-O357 ONLY)\nInle%\n\nFilter -\n\n(40-74,_)\n\nSurge pressure - clean element: 500 psig in I0 ms\nParticle Retaining Capacity - Delta P shall not be greater\nthan 2 psi with the introduction of 0.2 grams A.C. fine dust.\nSurge Pressure - Contaminated Element:\n5C0 psig in IO ms\nwith 0.2 grams of A.C. fine dust in filter.\nStrength Demonstration:\nFilter must withstand 200 Delta P\n\n.""\n\nTest Port Filter (40-74__)\nSurge pressure - clean element:\n500 psig in 10 ms\nParticle retaining capacity: Similar to inlet filter test no requirements\n\n17-6\n\n. 1\n\' :\n\nACCEPTANCE TESTS\n\n(ME.,28/_.-0021+\nONLY)\nExamination of product\nProof prQs_ur(,,\n(_&O pslg) and external\nLeakage (5 x 10"\xc2\xb0 std co/see)\nCracking pressure: Upstream poppets - 0.2 to &.O psi\nDownstream poppets I.O to 5.0 psi\nInternal Leakage 1 x ]0"I*std co/see hnlitu_\nPressure drop 1_at .12 #/mln of helium\n(inlet press_ 5 at .2_ #/rainof helium\n].81psi_\nCleanlinessVerifY,\ncation\n\n"\n\nExamination of filter element\nBubble Point Test - Filter: Inlet - 3 to &.5 in.

The movable contact arm\nassembly consists of a penma-nickelmovable contact arm with a fine-silver\nplated contact installed on one end.\n\nThe cap assembly consists of two\n\nHaynes 52 alloy terminals installed in a cold rolled steel cap and\ninsulated from the cap by glass insulation. The cap is hell-arc welded\nto the top edge of the drawn cup. The thermostat is vacuum-baked,backfilled with 90 percent dry nitrogen and 10 percent dry helium and welded\nin an atmosphere of the same composition.\nThe bimetallic disc is positioned in the bottom of the cup and its\nOD is held in place by the ceramic insulating liner which fits snugly\ninside the cup. The rounded bottom of the transfer pin rides on the center\ncf the disc.\n\n,\n\nThe top of the tran.._fer bears against the -.enter the\npin\nof\n\nmovable contact arm. One end of the contact arm is attached to the\ninternal end of one of the terminals; the other end of the contact arm\ncontains the electrical contact and is positioned Just below the internal\nend of the second terminal which also contains an electrical contact.\nA rise in temperature causes the bimetallic disc to snap away\nfrom the cup bottom.\n\n:,\n\nAs the disc snaps, it pushes against the transfer\n\nzg-I\n\n:\n\npin which in turn pushes against the contact arm causing the contact\nat the end of the arm to make positive contact with the contact at\nthe end of the second terminal. This action completesan electrical\ncircuit within the switch.\nA drop in temperature causes the bimetallic disc to snap toward\nthe cup bottom.

The spool assembly is composed of a stainless steel body,\nwith a non-magneticweld midway between the end flanges, a stainless\nsteel plug, a stainless steel cover and two coils, the direct coil and\nthe automatic coil. The body weld forms a non-magneticgap and prevents\na magnetic short circuit through the body material. The inlet end\nof the body is threaded externally with O.7188-20NS-3Athreads designed\n\n"\n\nto mate with a Resistoflex Dynatube fitting. The plug, which mates\ninto the body via an interference fit, is cylindricalin shape,\n_._tha hole drilled axially through its entire length. The downstream\nend is counter-boredto serve as a retainer for one end of the spring.\nThe coil assembly consists of two coils, the direct coil and\nthe automatic coil, wpund coaxially around th_ valve body. The\n,\n\nautomatic coil contains 685 turns of #30 AWO copper wire having a\nresistance of 17.2 +O._ ohms at 68F. The direct coil is wound around\nthe automatic coil and is insulated from it with electricaltape.\nThe direct coil contains 1020 turns of #26 Ak_ copper wire having a\nresistance of 1A.3 __O.Aohms at 68F.\n\nThe cover is tubular in shape\n\nwith three equally spaced mounting ears at one end. A slot, to provide\nan exit for the electrical leads, is located at the end of the cover\n\n21-i\n\nI\n\nthat contains the mounting ears.\ncover to the body.\n\nAn interference\n\nfit secures the\n\nThe four electrical leads from the two coils are\n\nsoldered to four #20 AWG stranded teflon coated copper conductors.\nThe four teflon insulated wires are twisted together and sheathed\nin a transparent extruded teflon Jacket.\n\nThe cable assembly is then\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nfed through the slot in the cover and secured by means of a grommet\ninstalled _n the slot.\n\nThe hole is sealed off from the atmosphere by\nq\n\nmeans of a potting compound.\n\nThe armature is cylindrical in shape\n\nwith the downstream end terminating in a conical shaped stellite tip\n(valve poppet) which provides the contact area for the valve seat.\nThe oxidizer flow path is through an axially drilled hole terminating\nin four equally-spaced slanted holes drilled through the _all of the\ncylinder to serve as flow ports.\n\nThe upstream end of the armature\n\nis counter-bored to serve as a retainer for one end of the spring.\nt\nThe spring is sandwiched between the plug and the armature and is\nretained by the respective ccunterbores described above.\n\nThe spring\n\n4\n\nand armature are retained by the seat assembly which screws into the\nvalve body.\n\nThe seat assembly consists of a stainless steel seat,\n\na teflon seal and"a stainless steel insert.\n\nThe teflon seal is pressed\n\ninto the seat to form the poppet seating surface.\nin the seat by the insert.\n\nThe seal is retained\n\nA stainless steel pressure drop trim\n\norifice and a sediment strainer with a spherical particle rating of\n165 microns are installed against a shoulder in the inlet end of the\nvalve body and are held in place by a snap ring which is installed in a\ngroove in the body.\n\n21-2\n\nI\n\n_ith the valve coils de-energized, the valve poppet is held\nagainst the teflon seat by the force of the armature spring _nd the\nforce exerted by the propellant supply pressure acting on the armature\nthus preventing oxidizer from flowing downstream of the oxidizer valve\nseat.\n\nWhen either of the coils is energized, the force set up in\n\nthe armature by the electromagneticfield will overcome the force\nholding the poppet against the seat and the poppet will be pulled away\nfrom the seat. The oxidizer will flow into the valve b_y,\n\nthrough\n\nthe orifice, through the sediment strainer, through the spring and the\nfour slanted holes in the armature, around the poppet, through the\ncent.er the seat assembly and finally to the injector head assembly.\nof\nThe fuel valve assembly is identical in constructionand operation\nto the oxidizer valve assembly except for the size of the pressure drop\ntrim orifice and the number of turns in the valve coils. The fuel\nautomatic coil contains 50_ turns of #30 A_\n\ncopper wire l_ving a\n\nresistance of 12.6 _+0.3ohms at 68F. The fuel direct coil contains\n1080 turns of #26 AWG copper wire having a resistance of IA._ _+0.6\n,\n\nohms at 68F.\n\nIn order to minimize main chamber ignition spikes, the\n\nfuel valve is designed to open two m_llieecondsbefore the oxidizer\nvalve.\nThe injector\n\nhead assembly\n\nis\n\nComposed of an aluminum housing\n\nassembly, an aluminum and stainless steel pre-igniter insert assembly,\ntwo phenolic\nigniter\n\ntubes.\n\ninsulators\nThe fuel\n\nand stainless\nvalve,\n\nsteel\n\nwhich is\n\n21--\n\nfuel\n\nand oxidizer\n\noriented\n\n50 degrees\n\nprefrom the\n\n_\n!\n\naxis of the eugitm, is attached to the injector assembly by means of\ntitanium screws through the three ears on the valve cover.\n\nThe pro-\n\nignitor insert assembly is located in the center of the housing assembly\nand is coaxial with it.\n\nThe insulators are part of the thermal isolation\na\n\nof the valves from the injector assembly.\n\nThe oxidizer valve is\n\nattached to the injector assembly by three stainless steel screws.\nThe downstream\n\nend of the pro-igniter insert assembly is tubular in\n\nshape and projects beyond the face of the\nchamber area.\nis the\n\n\xc2\xb0\n\ninjector into the combustion\n\nThe projecting end of the pre-lgniter insert assembly\n\npro-igniter\n\nchamber.\n\nThe oxidizer igniter tube orifice is installed in the pre-igniter\ninsert downstream of the oxidizer valve.\n\nThe fuel igniter tube\n\norifice is installed in the housing, assembly downstream of the fuel\n-alve.\n\nWhen assembled, the component parts of the injector head\n\nassembly form chambers, passages and manifolds to distribute the\npropellants where required for optimum ignition characteristics,\ncombustion stability, and temperature distribution on the inner wall\nof the combustion chamber and the outer wall of the pre-igniter\nchamber.\n\nOxidizer leaving the oxidizer valve assembly flows through the\n\ni\n\noxidizer igniter tube into the pre-igniter chamber through an O.OA3\ninch diameter hole.\n\nSimultaneously,\n\noxidizer flows out through four\n\n"\n\n....\n\nequally spaced radial holes in the upstream end of the igniter tube.\nAfter leaving the oxidizer igniter tube orifice holes, oxidizer flows\n\n21_&\n\n!\n\ninto a circularmanifold chamber and thence into the combustion\nchamber through eight 0.035 inch diameter holes located equidistant\nfrom the engine axis in a circular pattern. The holes are slant\ndrilled so that the oxidizer flows outboard. The time lag between\nthe oxidizer entering the pre-igniter chamber and \'theoxidizer entering\nthe cambustion chamber is approximately five milliseconds.\nThe fuel enters the pre-igniter chamber and the combustion\nchamber in a manner similar to that of the oxidizer. The fuel hole\nin the pre-igniter chamber has a diameter of 0.025 inch.\n\nThe fuel\n\nenters the combustion chamber through 2A holes consistingof three\nsets of eight holes each.\n\nThe sets of holes are concentricabout the\n\naxis of the engine at different diameters from the center. The holes\nin each set are equidistant from each other. On the same radial lines\nas the oxidizer holes and slightly outboard are the 0.025 inch\ndiameter fuel holes used for main combustion. These holes are slant\n\n....\n,\n\ndrilled and aligned so that fuel flows inboard and impinges on the\noutboard flowing oxidizer, forming doublets. The streams from the\n"\n\nother two sets of fuel injector holes serve as coolants for the preigniter chamber and the combustion chamber wall. The seven 0.010\ninch and one 0.020 inch diameter holes which are used for cooling the\npre-igniter\n\nchamber are the\n\nsame diameter\n\nfrom the centerline\n\nas the\n\nmain combustionfuel holes but offset from them by 22-1/2 degrees.\n\n""\n\nThe 0.019 inch diameter holes that are used for cooling the combustion\nchamber wall are on the same radial lines as the doublets, but farther\n\n21-5\n\n,._\n\noutboard.\n\nAs with\n\nthe oxidizer,\n\nfuel\n\nenters\n\nthe pre-igniter\n\nch_ber\n\napproximately five milliseconds before fuel enters the main combustion\nchamber.\nThe thrust chamber assembly consists of a cobaltbase steel thrust\nchamber bell attached to a disilicide-coatedmolybdenum thrust chamber\nwith a wasp_lloy attach nut.\n\nThe engine throat is an integral part of\n\nthe thrust chamber. The thrust chamber assembly is attached to the\ninjector assembly with Rene _i split-ring assembly, a Rene AA attach\nring, a cobalt base steel combustion chamber seal and six Rene _i\nbolts that thread into inserts in the injector head assembly.\nUpon mixing in the combustionand pre-igniter chambers,the\npropellants react hypergolically. The products of this reaction are\nhigh temperature gases which create a high pressure in the combustion\nchamber before escaping through the engine throat. The gases are\naccelerated to supersonicvelocity in the divergent section of the\nthrust chamber and produce a resulting thrust as the gas molecules\nleave the tz_rustchamber bell.\nThe important performance characteristicsof the rocket engine\n,\n\nassembly and general information concerningthe componentsare\nlisted below:\nPropellant i_et pressure\nStatic, operationalrange\nDynamic, operational range\nDynamic, specificationperformance\n\n177 to 190 psia\n166 to 179 psia\n170 +2, 5 psia\n\nProof pressure, specificationrequirements\nValves\nA65 peig\nInjector\nhead\n_65 peig\n\n21-6\n\nI\n_i_"\n\nBurst pressure,\nspecification\nValves\nInjector\nhead\nF_lmum extez_al\nMaximum internal\nspecification\n\nrequirements\n\npropellant\n\n700 psig\n700 psig\nleakage\n\n(seat)\nleakage,\nrequirement\n\nnone allowed\n1.5 cc/6\n100 p_ig\n\nrain GN at\n2\n\nMaximum internal (seat) leakage,\nacceptance test\n\n1.0 cc/6 rainGN2 at\niO0 p_ig\n\nReverse seat leakage, specification\nrequirement\n\n3 cc/6 min GN2 at 20 psig\n\nVoltage, specificationperf.\n\n24-30 VDC\n\nVoltage, operationalrange\n\n21-32 VDC\n\nMaximum current\nAutomatic soils\nDirect coils\n\n4.0 amps total at 27 VDC\ni.O amps total at 27 VDC\n\noperating\ntemperatures\nPropellant\nvalves,\ncontinuous\nPropellant valves, 300 pulses\nCombustion chamber, steady state\n\n200\xc2\xb0F\n275\xc2\xb0F\n2_50@F\n\nPropellant\ntemperature\nrange\nSpecificationperformance\nOperational range\nOxidizer to fuel ratio\n\n.\n\n2 to 1\n\nVacuum thrust\n\'\n\n40 to IO0\xc2\xb0F\n40 to 150\xc2\xb0F\n\ni00 _+5ibs\n\nMinimum total operating life\n_pecificationrequirement\nDemonstrated\n(qual.\nand off\n\nlimits)\n\nSpecificationnumber\nSCD number (NR part number)\nQualified\nwith integral\nfilter\nscreen (Aft.)\nQualified with integral filter\nscreen (S.

The tubes\nare attached by welding at both ends.\nOxidizer leaving the oxidizer valve assembly flows through the\nthree-elghthsinch tube to the circular oxidizer manifold in the\ninjector assembly. From the manifold, the oxidizer flows through\nsixteen equally spaced 0.026 inch diameter holes to the combustion\nchamber. The sixteen holes are drilled at a slight angle away from\nthe center llne of the engine. Similarly, the fuel leaving the\nfuel valve assembly flows through the three-eighthsinch tube to _,tze\ncircular fuel manifold in the injector assembly. From the manifold,\nthe\nholes\n\nfuel flows through sixteen equally spaced 0.021 inch diameter\nto the\n\ncombustion\n\nchamber.\n\n22-5\n\nThe sixteen\n\nholes\n\nare drilled\n\noutboard of the oxidizer injector holes at a slight angle toward\nthe center line of the engine. The fuel injector holes and the\noxidizer injector holes are on the same radial lines.\n\nBecause of\n\nthe angles of the drilled holes, the flow of oxidizer intersects\nthe flew of fuel almost in_ediatelyafter they leave the injector\nassembly. The upstream conical surface of an In_ernal shoulder is\nlocated at the _nterseetienpoint; this surface serves as a "splash"\nplate. The intersectingflow paths and the splash plate ensure that\nthe oxidizer and fuel mix ar_lreact as required to produce the\noptimum in ignition characteristics,combustionstability,and\ntemperaturedistribution on the inner wall of the combustion chamber.\nUpon mixing, the propellants react hypergolically. The products of this reaction are high temperaturegases which create a\nhigh pressure in the combustion chamber before escaping through\nthe engine nozzle throat. The gases are acceleratedto supersonic\nvelocity in the divergent section of the nozzle and produce a\nresultingthrust as the gas molecules leave the nozzle exit.\nNozzle extensionsare provided to duct the engine exhaust gases\nthrough the spacecraft heat shield.
