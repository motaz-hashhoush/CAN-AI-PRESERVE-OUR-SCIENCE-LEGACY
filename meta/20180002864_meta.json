However, in the future we anticipate that CubeSats will be used for missions requiring reliability of 1-3 years for Earth-observing missions and even longer for Planetary, Heliophysics, and Astrophysics missions. Their growing potential utility is driving an interagency effort to improve and quantify CubeSat reliability, and more generally, small satellite mission risk. The Small Satellite Reliability Initiative (SSRI)\u2014an ongoing activity with broad collaborative participation from civil, DoD, and commercial space systems providers and stakeholders\u2014targets this challenge. The Initiative seeks to define implementable and broadly-accepted approaches to achieve reliability and acceptable risk postures associated with several SmallSat mission risk classes\u2014from \u201cdo no harm\u201d missions, to those associated with missions whose failure would result in loss or delay of key national objectives. These approaches will maintain, to the extent practical, cost efficiencies associated with small satellite missions and consider constraints associated with supply chain elements, as appropriate. The SSRI addresses this challenge from two architectural levels\u2014the mission- or system-level, and the component- or subsystem-level. The mission- or system-level scope targets assessment approaches that are efficient and effective, with mitigation strategies that facilitate resiliency to mission or system anomalies while the component- or subsystem-level scope addresses the challenge at lower architectural levels. The initiative does not limit strategies and approaches to proven and traditional methodologies, but is focused on fomenting thought on novel and innovative solutions. This paper discusses the genesis of and drivers for this initiative, how the public-private collaboration is being executed, findings and recommendations derived to date, and next steps towards broadening small satellite mission potential.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20180002864, "endDate": "2017-08-10T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Inst. of Aeronautics and Astronautics", "location": "Reston, VA, United States"}}, "meetingId": "4317785a7f9c489ba9b01ef79fb2a67e", "id": "3222693db235411d97586713306674b9"}, {"meta": {"organization": {"name": "Utah State Univ.", "location": "Logan, UT, United States"}}, "meetingId": "4317785a7f9c489ba9b01ef79fb2a67e", "id": "298f15d12e9c4c6a948220e2961bd3a3"}], "name": "Small Satellite Conference", "location": "Logan, Utah", "id": "4317785a7f9c489ba9b01ef79fb2a67e", "startDate": "2017-08-05T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20180002864, "id": "cf1a5f04965e4929bf2d989a68f61dd6", "publicationDate": "2017-08-05T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20180002864.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20180002864/downloads/20180002864.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20180002864/downloads/20180002864.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20180002864/downloads/20180002864.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
