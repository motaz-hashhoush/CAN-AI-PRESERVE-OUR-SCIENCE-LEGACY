b'April 1969\t\n\nBrief 69-10087\n\nNASA TECH BRIEF.\nNASA Tech Briefs are issued to summarize specific innovations derived from the U.S. space program,\nto encourage their commercial application. Copies are available to the public at 15 cents each\nfrom the Clearinghouse for Federal Scientific and Technical Information, Springfield, Virginia 22151.\n\nCarbon Offers Advantages as Implant Material in Human Body\nEvidence from several sources indicates that a number of high-purity, high-strength carbon or graphite\ncomposites which have been developed for aerospace\napplications are chemically, biologically, and physically compatible with the fluids and tissues in the\nhuman body. In addition to their high strength and\nlong-term biocompatibility, these materials can be\nreadily fabricated into complex configurations and\nare amenable to several of the commonly used sterilization techniques. Because of these characteristics,\nthe aerospace carbonaceous materials are proposed as\nsurgical implants to correct various pathological conditions in the body resulting from disease or injury.\nAn example of the possible medical use of the carbonaceous materials would be as cosmetic and protective bone replacements in the skull, face, and\nhands. In present practice, stainless steel (or other\nmetal) replacements are prepared as inlays and secured to the adjacent bone by pins or screws. However, stainless steel has been found to degrade substantially with time from chemical and galvanic corrosion. This results in reduced strength of the replacement and probable toxic reaction of the host tissues to\nthe corrosion products. The carbonaceous materials\ncould be advantageously substituted directly for metals in this application. Other suggested uses of the\ncarbonaceous materials in the body are outlined\nbelow.\nImplantable Splints. Such splints are generally\nbeams or elongated plates attached directly to the\ndamaged bone by pins or screws. They extend suf ficiently beyond the damaged area to carry the full\nloading from the undamaged area on one side of the\nfracture to the undamaged aea on the other side.\nThis arrangement permits the damaged area to repair\nitself without being displaced or disturbed by the body\n\nactivity. While it is desirable to leave the splints in\npermanently, the degradation of the metals presently\nused is found to make their eventual removal often\nmandatory. In some cases, it has been found necessary\nto remove them even before healing is completed,\neither because of the toxicity of the corrosion products\nor the decline of structural integrity in the splint. Substitution of carbonaceous materials for metals promises to alleviate these problems.\nMyoeleciric Probes. These devices are implanted in\nthe desired muscle tissue to pick up (or introduce) the\nsmall electrical signal (picowatts to nanowatts) by\nwhich the nervous system instructs the muscle to perform. In medical research they are used to study the\nphenomena of motor control and reactions to various\nstimuli. In rehabilitation, attempts are being made to\nutilize the naturally occurring myoelectric signals to\ncontrol externally powered prosthetic devices. The\napparent galvanic inertness of the carbons indicates\nthat they should be very desirable materials for this\napplication when implanted to provide a percutaneous\nelectrical conductor. Flexibility of the carbon filaments or small-diameter rods would permit normal\nmotion of the body member without disturbing the\nimplant.\nEpithelial Bone Extensions. The orthopedic concept.\ninvolved is based on the premise that bone can be induced to grow to an inorganic member designed to\npick up mechanical loads external to the body and\ntransfer them directly into the skeletal structure.\nMaterials that have been investigated to date are corrosion-resistant metals and high-strength ceramics.\nSuccess has been very limited because of corrosion\nproblems and rejection of these materials by the body\ntissues. The carbon materials show promising potential for this application.\n(continued overleai(\n\nThis document was prepared under the sponsorship of the National\t\nAeronautics and Space Administration.

In hemodialysis and\nother treatments of the bloodstream, it is desirable to\nconnection permanently into an\nimplant a b y\nartery and the corresponding vein so that the blood\nmay be circulated through auxiliary equipment outside the body and returned to the normal bloodstream\nafter treatment. Materials presently used for this\npurpose are stainless steels and various polymers.\nThe steels lack long-term biocompatibility, and the\npolymers are not sufficiently durable, so that the\nimplants must be replaced more frequently than is\ndesirable. The improved biocompatibility expected\nfrom the substitution of the carbon materials, coupled with their high physical strength, indicates their\nattractiveness for this application.\nImplantable Prosthetics. The preferred materials\npresently used for anatomical joint replacement (e.g.,\nfor hip joints) are type 316 stainless steel, certain\ntitanium alloys, and in some cases, ultrahard materials, such as stellite. Degradation of these materials\nis principally attributable to low-rate galvanic action\nwith the body fluids, which results in surface, intergranular, or massive corrosion and consequent loss of\nstructural integrity of the metals. In some cases, the\ncorrosion products are also toxic to the host organism.\nIn almost all cases, mobility of the joint decreases\nbecause of substantially increased friction. The structural properties of certain aerospace carbons closely\napproximate those of type 316 stainless steel, and in\naddition these carbons provide self-lubrication on\nbearing Surfaces. These carbons therefore appear to\n\nBrief 69-10087\t\n\noffer excellent potential as replacements for anatomical joints.\nReplacement Heart Valves. One of the most widely\nused replacement heart valves is the Starr-Edwards\ndesign, a simple ball-in-cage check valve. Some recent\nreported failures of this valve, are apparently due to\ndeterioration of the ball by a very slow chemical reaction with the bloodstream. Vitreous carbon spheres\ncan be produced in a variety of sizes to very precise\ndimensions and with polished surfaces. By making\nthem hollow, their normal specific gravity can be\nmatched to the bloodstream to provide neutral\nbuoyancy, thus reducing inertial effects. This material is heat-sterilizable and is apparently unaffected by the conditions encountered in the body.\n\n.\n\nNote:\nThis information is presented as a concept only.\nQuestions may be directed to:\nTechnology Utilization Officer\nMarshall Space Flight Center\nHuntsville, Alabama 358.12\nReference: B69-10087\n\nPatent status\nNo patent action is contemplated by NASA.\nSource: J.
