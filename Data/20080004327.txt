The invention is particularly directed to a removable hand rail/hand hold for\nI5\nextra-vehicular activity (EVA) in space.\nHand raiVhand holds are conventionally permanently attached to a structure and are not easily removed. Removable hand railhand holds have been\nproposed, but these structures require a receptacle and\ncomplicated latching mechanisms that are internal to 2o\nthe structure.\nPermanently attached hand rails/hand holds for extra-vehicular activity structures required dedicated volumes which impacted Packaging. Also, Permanently\nmounted hand rails/hand holds added total weight to 25\nthe structure and a separate hand rail/hand hold is\nneeded in every hand rail/hand hold location.\nConventional removable hand rail/hand hold structures require a socket to be plugged jnto a\nwhich is located internal to the structure. Such a device 30\nrequires complicated locking mechanisms.\nIt is, therefore, an object of the present invention to\nprovide a removable hand rail/hand hold having a simple guide mechanism that attaches to mounting brackets\n35\non a support structure.\nAnother object of the invention is to provide an improved integral alignment/capture mounting mechanism for a hand rail/hand hold which utilizes an improved locking means to retrain the hand rail/hand\n40\nhold in its proper position.\nBACKGROUNDART\nKane U.S. Pat. No. 1,939,501 is directed to a thread\nguide for knitting machines. The disclosed structure\nutilizes a carrier plate with a central tongue having 45\nmatching slots on each side. The tongue and slots cooperate with two spaced screws in a guide arm to form a\nconnection between the carrier plate and the guide arm.\nLevine U.S. Pat. No. 4,886,297 discloses a skateboard\nhaving a removably attached handle. The device uti- 50\nlizes connecting means comprising a base plate that is\noriginally connected to a standard skateboard truck bolt\npattern, an inverted U-shaped bracket for receiving a\ntongue member at the rear of a handle lower plate, and\na pair of aligned equally spaced apart female sleeve 55\nmembers that accommodate a connecting sleeve in coaxial alignment at the front of the handle lower plate.\nAfter the tongue member of the handle lower plate is\nengaged with the inverted U-shaped bracket, the connecting pin o r retaining pin means is disposed through 60\nthe aligned sleeves to secure the handle in place.\n\n2\n\nwith one of the mounting brackets. A securing bracket\nis disposed at the opposite end of the hand rail/hand\nhold which connects with the other mounting bracket\nby means of a locking device. The alignment/capture\nbracket has a central tapered tongue with two matching\nslots disposed on each side thereof.\nThe tapered feature of the central tongue Serves to\nlaterally guide the bracket into mating position with the\nmounting bracket, and the matching slots located on\neach side of the tongue insure proper registration and\nalignment. Further, the mounting bracket for the alignment/capture bracket has a securing/guide bar with a\nsloping front lip that serves to vertically guide the alignment capture bracket into mating position.\nThe hand rail/hand hold is attached to the support\nstructure by first mating the alignment/capture bracket\nto its receptive mounting bracket and then aligning a set\nof apertures in the securing bracket so that they communicate with a corresponding passage in the second\nmounting bracket. With the apertures and passage properly aligned, a pin is inserted through a single hole defined by the apertures and passage and thereby secures\nthe hand rail/hand hold to the support structure. Hand\nrailhand hold removal is easily executed by the reverse\nprocedure.\nDESCRIPTION OF T H E DRAWINGS\nThe objects, advantages and novel features of the\ninvention will be more fully apparent from the following detailed description when read in connection with\nthe accompanying drawings wherein like numerals are\nused throughout to identify like parts.\nFIG. 1is a perspective view of a hand hold assembly\nconstructed in accordance with the present invention;\nis an\nview Of a portion Of the hand\nshown in\nFIG. 3 is a section view taken along the line 3-3 in\n\n';\n\n';\n\nFIG. 4 is an elevation view showing the hand hold\nassembled to its locking bracket; and\nFIG. 5 is an elevation view of the opposite end of the\nfrom that shown in\n4.\n\nBEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT T H E\nINVENTION\nReferring now to the drawings there is shown in\nFIG. 1 a removable hand rail/hand hold assembly constructed in accordance with the present invention.
