b"NASA PRESENTATION\nRonald L. Thomas\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration\nLewis Research Center\nCleveland, Ohio\nGood afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. I will briefly go through a\nprogram plan here that we've worked up. We've been taking a hard look\nat this area for the past year, and also other solar energy areas; and\nwe have put together a preliminary program plan in wind energy which we\nhave discussed with the NSF.\nObviously, as a result of our workshop, there are going to be a lot\nmore inputs into this plan than you're going to see now. This plan, I\nwant to stress, is tentative. But it will give you an idea of this fiveyear program. First I will briefly review the objectives, the approach\nand the planned accomplishments for this program.\nThe objective is to develop a wind energy system that supplies\nreliable energy at a cost that is competitive with other energy systems.\nThis is a government-directed industry program with strong university\nsupport. We plan to set up a review board which would consist of utilities, manufacturers, consumers, and the appropriate municipal, state,\nand federal agencies. This board would be like an advisory board. It\nwould meet and review thevprogram from time to time, and offer valuable\ninputs as to the way we are proceeding and so forth, which areas should\ngo forth faster, which slower, that type of thing.\nWe feel very strongly that there would be an effort, within our national laboratories, to provide the basis for program direction.\nWe would study, build, and test wind energy conversion systems and\ncomponents without storage. We would also study, build, and test energy\nstorage systems. And I will go into the reason here: We feel that we\nshould get on quickly with the job of the wind energy conversion system,\nand not necessarily tie it directly in with the storage right at the\nbeginning.\nA very important facet is that we will conduct meteorological studies\nin cooperation with other agencies, particularly with NOAA, to estimate\nthe wind energy potential and determine favorable regions and sites for\nwind power. Another important part of this overall program is to study\nand identify the suitable applications for a demonstration test \xe2\x80\x94 just\nwhat is the overall potential and what are these applications? At the\nend of 5 years we hope to have identified cost-effective wind energy\n\n244\n\nconversion systems, not necessarily with storage tied to them. And we\nwould have these systems in operation and have some data to back this up.\nNot only will we have some of these prototype subsystems in operation,\nbut we will have had bench tests and subsystem tests of the key components\ngoing on within industry and within universities or the laboratories.\nDemonstration systems for selected applications and some of these,\nhopefully, with storage would be at the point where we would be ready to\nbegin tests at the end of 5 years. It is unlikely that in 5 years, we\nwould actually have systems complete with storage and for actual applications ready to go.\nAt the end of five years we hope to have determined the potential\nfor wind energy in this country. We would also plan to have under development analytical techniques for selecting sites for wind conversion plants.\nNext, I will discuss several action diagrams to point out the key\nphases of the overall program. The key phases are the wind energy conversion system, the meteorological studies, the energy storage system,\nand environmental impact studies.\nIn the overall program (fig. 1) you can see we would be carrying\non a number of steps in parallel, starting in the first year. This\nwould be the study, design, build and test of wind energy conversion\nsystems, without storage. We gather and assess wind data to come up\nwith the favorable site selections and what is the potential of wind\nenergy. We would study, design and build and test energy storage\nsystems. We would identify and study the suitable applications for\nwind energy, concentrating on the most favorable ones in the beginning\nand coming up with what are the practical applications for wind energy.\nThen, we need to determine what the requirements are for major\nfacilities. We are encouraged by what came out^of the workshop here. It\nlooks like a lot of the components and sub-systems can be adequately designed with simulations and modeling.\nAll the above phases are parallel and will focus on the design and\ndemonstration for those favorably selected applications. We would then\nconstruct and test those demonstration systems. That completes the overall program.\nNow in figure 2, looking at the wind energy conversion systems\nwhich are primarily the towers, the rotors and the electrical generation. Where should we begin, and how can we put a wind generator\ntogether that meets our requirements. First we started with systems\ndesign studies of wind conversion systems. We would concentrate on\nthose without storage at this point, and these would be to identify\nthe size of machines that makes sense, hopefully focusing these into\napplications.\nWe then select the ones with the most promise to actually have prototypes running within the 5 years. We may pick out one or more combinations for detail design of these prototypes. Once we have a detail design\n245\n\nof these prototypes, we would then select the most promising one and proceed with construction of that prototype. We would also at that time\nbegin bench testing and in-house testing of the components and subsystems.\nAlso in the systems designs we would come up with some advanced concepts. These would be split out and paralleled to start studying these\nadvanced concepts, deciding which of these should be built and tested,\nprimarily at the component level.\nWhat we have is a program going down three paths leading toward the\nconstruction of prototjypes as quickly as possible, probably building very\nheavily on the technology that was discussed by Dr. Hutter, and breaking\noff in parallel component tests and modeling of rotors and the key electrical conversion and ^Iso with advanced concepts.\ni\ni\nWe would test these prototypes within the 5 years, and all of this\nwould be input, then, into the design of the demonstrations for selected\napplications.\nIn the area of the meteorological studies (fig. 3) we have mainly\nstarted out to assess what the existing wind data are. Obviously, we\nwill need very close cooperation and coordination with an agency like\nNCAA. The purpose is to identify sites for these first prototypes ajid\npick out the favorable sites. We must get the wind data we need to do the\nthe detailed designs of the prototypes.\nAlso we want to determine the wind energy potential in the U. S.\nUsing the existing data we would try to determine that potential. We\nwould determine the favorable wind sites in the U. S. Also we would\ndevelop analytical techniques for wind prospecting so you don't have to\nsmother the landscape with anomometers.\nWe would make additional measurements, wind measurements that are\nrequired in areas where there isn't sufficient data and feed this back\nto up-date the wind energy potential estimates.\nIn the area of energy storage (fig. 4-) we would again look at the\nvarious types of energy storage systems that are available. We would do\nsome design studies and select the systems that look the most promising\nfor fabrication and evaluation. In parallel, there are going to be some\nadvanced storage systems identified. We will do design studies on these\nsystems also and build and test those advanced components. All of this,\nagain, leads into the demonstration systems occurring after 5 years.\nFor the conversion systems in Fiscal 197M- we would immediately start\nwith several systems design studies, followed by a detailed design of the\nprototypes that appear to be the most promising. Remember that we have\na key point here where we bring in the advisory groups to help in the\nselection of this. We begin construction of that prototype at the beginning of Fiscal 1976, and should be able to have a prototype and start\ntesting at the beginning of Fiscal 1977. We also build and test the\nprototype components and sub-systems as soon as we've identified the system that we have selected.\n\n246\n\nThe meteorological studies are an on-going program. We envision\nthese studies would assess and make use of existing wind data, set up\ninstruments for making additional wind measurements as required, and\ndevelop analytical techniques for wind prospecting.\nThe key points are that by the middle of Fiscal 1975 we would have\nthose prototype sites, and have made an up-dated determination of just\nwhat the wind potential is in the United States in these selected areas.\nBy here we would identify these suitable sites for selected applications.\nI haven't gone through all of the program here but very briefly have\ntried to give you what we see as the approach at this point to getting on\nwith the job. The key thing is to do these things in parallel, carrying\nthem out, and to constantly be evaluating the direction we are going in.\nDISCUSSION\nQ:\n\nWhen do you expect to be able to make announcements on this or a\nsimilar program being started?\nDr. Morse: I would say within the next several months.\nQ: You announced the NSF funding program. How about the NASA?\nDr. Morse: The funding is for wind energy conversion. The projects or\npart of the program that NASA would conduct for NSF and the grants or\ncontracts that it would issue and manage would be from those funds.\nMr. Thomas: And as I'm sure you are all aware, NSF is the lead agency.\nThey have the solar energy program. What NASA is willing to contribute at this point is manpower and facilities. We have laboratories,\nexperimental capability, and analysis and project management. That\nwould be NASA's contribution.\nQ: Out of this million dollars from NSF?\nMr. Thomas: Yes.\n\n'.\n\nQ: What is left over?\nDr. Morse: It's all left over. They are not going to pay their salaries\nout of that. NASA Lewis is contributing the manpower, the facilities,\nand the experience to the program. The money that I mentioned that\nNSF has will be spent partially through NSF and partially through\nNASA Lewis. Again, this is a program with strong university and industry involvement. We expect the bulk of that money to be spent\nexternally.\nQ:\n\nAre there any sorting criteria that you can give us for which type\nof proposals go to which, or do all of the proposals go to. NSF for\nthis time period?\nDr. Morse: All RFP's and program announcements will state clearly on\nwhether that should be directed to Lewis or to NSF. At the moment,\nunsolicited proposals should go to NSF. They will be reviewed in\nthe usual way except that now Lewis will be included as a reviewer\non all proposals. I might also mention that proprietary proposals\nwill be handled accordingly.\n247\n\nQ:\n\nThere seems to be an incompatibility \xe2\x80\x94 maybe it's only by inference \xe2\x80\x94\nbetween system design and your technology in the position phase. You\nhave a systems design that goes right on into the concept. You have\na technology phase which says there are some technology gaps which\nhave to be identified. Are you fellows getting together on this?\nDr. Morse: Yes, we are.\nQ:\n\nThat's one question. The second question is: Is your objective\nmerely to demonstrate a large rotor that can effectively turn out so\nmuch power in some kind of wind, regardless of -what you use it far?\nOr is it to integrate an objective as to how you will use this energy\nin a system?\nMr. Thomas: The objective is to discover how you use the energy and\nwhether or not it can be practical and competitive.\nI think the other point is, too \xe2\x80\x94 I mean, you clan sit back and show\nall these little magic blocks up there on the Vu-graph. The way those\nwere arrived at is: What is a reasonable objective and goal to get\naccomplished by the end of 5 years?\nWe set down our plan, what we thought we could do. Then those blocks\nare really backed up by the actual tasks that have to be required in\neach one of those areas, in terms of manpower and dollar expenditures\nand what the hopeful output will be for each one of those blocks. It\nwould be a number.\nNow, I won't go into detail on those, because, if I put up the definition of those tasks, give you the outline of a work statement and\ntold you what the manpower was and what the dollars were, there\nwouldn't be much sense in putting out a competitive RFP because all\nproposals would come with the same costs and the same amount of manpower.\nNow, obviously, what's come out of this meeting, we are going to get\ncriticisms, good and bad; depending on how much money NSF is going to\ndivert to this NASA effort depends on how fast we go down this path.\nBut we look on this as a joint venture with NASA and NSF, and to go\ndown those parallel paths together in the best and the optimum way\noverall.\nQ:\n\nDr. Morse, does this mean that the proposals which have been submitted this year already on the subject are \xe2\x80\x94 to use a word of Mr.\nZeigler's \xe2\x80\x94 inoperative?\nDr. Morse: No, that isn't so. We have ten unsolicited proposals, two of\nwhich have been reviewed. The other eight are in various stages of\ndiscussion and formalization. Some of these proposals may very well\nbe supported, based on their own merits. It may be that some of these\nproposals fall very close to what we have in mind for an RFP, in which\ncase we would not go ahead with that, and indicate to the principal\ninvestigator that, at the moment, we are going to hold off on that.\n\n248\n\nQ:\n\nWill the storage facilities or the mechanism for the program selected\nfor storage involve a concept of shipping?\nMr. Thomas: Can you elaborate on that? I'm not sure I know what you mean.\nQ: Does the use of wind energy involve shipping in any way?\nDr. Morse: You mean like producing hydrogen and shipping it in some form?\nQ:\n\nNo. For sail, the idea being if the storage mechanisms were practical\nenough \xe2\x80\x94 is that ruled out?\nMr. Thomas: We haven't really considered that, although the FCST panel on\ntransportation did recommend that the old sailing ships may hold a lot\nof application today and that work be done in that area.\nQ:\n\nI noticed in your 5-year plan you didn't have any kind of estimates\nor projections on what kind of money would be allotted for wind research. Will you comment on that?\nDr. Morse: I really don't think it is appropriate to comment on that,\nsince one never knows how those will turn out. We do have a 5-year\nprogram. We have worked out a budget for all those areas, and the\nonly figure that is really a pretty real one is $12.2 million for\nnext year.\nQ:\n\nIt appears that you really intend mostly study programs the first\nyears, instead of hardware. Is that true?\nMr. Thomas: That's true, but those study programs are the first step in\nreally defining and identifying which way to go on the hardware.\nDr. Morse: Although I might indicate the program at Oklahoma State is\nlooking at two key components of the system, and that is a hardware\ntype of a program, the bulk of it is systems studies.\nQ:\n\nYou mentioned earlier you have provisions or are you making plans\nfor industry-university participation? Where in that program is the\nflexibility to do that sort of thing?\nMr. Thomas: It seems very clear to me, since I drew all the diagrams,\nbut at the end of the first systems studies which will be in the\nfirst fiscal year, we plan to do several parallel studies in the same\narea. Each of these studies would probably have several different\nconcepts. The point then is to pick out the system or systems that\nhave the potential for practical completion within the 5 years.\nThose systems would be reviewed by the advisory board. The advisory\nboard would be composed of representatives from the industries and\nuniversities that are working in this area and representatives from\nthe utilities or other potential users.\nDr. Morse: I might also add that the problem of universities responding\nto RFP's, if they have a 2-week response time or a very short response\ntime, is one that we have discussed and considered. We intend to maintain a strong university involvement as far along the program as it is\nappropriate to. So we're concerned with maintaining the involvement\nof the universities and industry. We would like to see a growing\nindustrial involvement. We would like very much to have them pick\n249\n\nup the ball and make something of it and the sooner the better.\nQ:\n\nIs the planning information that you included here going to be included in the proceedings of the workshop?\nDr. Morse: I would think a summary of what we said will be.\nCOMMENT: May I point out that we received recently from NSF two RTF's,\nboth two months after the deadline for response.\nDr. Morse:\nCOMMENT:\n\nRight, that's the gentleman from Alaska.\n\nAirmail takes one day.\n\nQ:\n\nWhat do:you see, if anything, as the place in this program for smallscale developments? In other words, on demonstrations and perhaps\nthe type of thing I was talking about the other day\xe2\x80\x94a demonstration\nof the home heating plant based on wind power.\nDr. Morse; I think it's in there, and I think that shows the power of\nthese workshops. We have been focused pretty heavily on a way to\nmake major impact using wind supplied energy in a major way. It's\nbecome apparent from this meeting and other discussions that perhaps\none way to attack the problem is through the small size user located\ntype of a system. We are going to give small users serious consideration in our planning, but youTre right, it was not a major part of\nour thinking.\n\nMr. Thomas: In all fairness, it really wasn't left out completely. The\noriginal systems design studies have been encompassed in the range of\n50 kilowatts on up. And maybe we have to go down a little further\nthan 50 kilowatts, but that was the size that we were looking at.\nThere would be application studies in there. The whole point is to\nidentify those applications that can do the job. If it turns out to\nbe 50-kilowatt machines and you have to put up thousands and thousands\nof them to do the job, that would very much influence the program.\nBut at the same time you wouldn't go just that way.\nat the large ones, too.\n\nYou'd be looking\n\nQ:\n\nDo you expect there will be anything in your RFP's on this, or will\nthis be handled on the basis of unsolicited proposal type of thing?\nMr. Thomas: My own feeling is that that would be part of the RFP route.\nDr. Morse;\n\nI would agree with that.\n\nQ:\n\nWould you clarify one point on your charts \xe2\x80\x94 the difference between\nenergy systems, energy resources, and solar energy?\nDr. Morse: Solar energy is a resource, and you need systems to use it.\nNSF had a program while solar was in its infancy, in which we were\nlooking at energy systems of the United States \xe2\x80\x94 for example, a report by Dr. Szego's company, several volumes on energy systems.\nWe were looking at geothermal, at coal gasification, at a variety of\n\n2.50\n\nother problems1. Solar energy grew to the point where it has .now been\nsingled out as a separate program area. This doesn't mean that it's\ndistinctly different from the resources systems.\nQ:\n\nIs the $300,000 being granted to Montana State and Oklahoma State a\ntotal figure for the both?\nDr. Morse: No, for the three \xe2\x80\x94 for NASA Lewis for this workshop, for\nMontana, and for Oklahoma State. I'm sorry, that comes to $200,000\nnot $300,000.\n\nQ: Are these FY 1973 funds?\nDr. Morse: Yes.\nQ:\n\nIs it illegal for a privately financed corporation to earn a profit\non proposals that are submitted in response to RFP from NASA or NSF\nfor this wind generator?\nDr. Morse: I'm not a lawyer. It's my understanding that that is legal.\n\nCOMMENT: In response to solicited proposals, I believe all the things\nthat normally have been going on, such as the fee, are perfectly legal.\nIt's only in response to an unsolicited proposal submitted that we must\nhave some kind of a cost-sharing as there is no fee allowed.\nMr. Thomas: We are going down that route right now with some of our\nRFP's, and these are either going to be cost plus fixed fee or just\na fixed price contract with a few in there. That's the way NASA\ndoes business. Now, on the unsolicited proposals, I'm not quite\nthat sure, but even there there are some ramifications. I know that\nsome contracts let for unsolicited proposals have included a fee.\nQ: Will NASA or NSF be handling the RFP's?\nDr. Morse: We haven't decided, but, since NASA is going to implement\nthis program, it seems reasonable that they will issue RFP's, evaluate\nthem, award the contract, monitor it, and follow it up. That doesn't\nmean that NSF will not do the same. There is still a difference\nbetween the total NSF program and the total NASA program.\n\n251\n\nFigure 1\nFIVE-YEAR WIND ENERGY PROGRAM\nOverall Program\n\nStudy, Design, Build and\nTest Wind Energy Conversion\nSystems without Storage\nGather and Assess Wind Data\nDesign of\nDemonstrations\nfor Selected\nApplications\n\nStudy, Design, Build and Test\nEnergy Storage Systems\n\nConstruct and\nTest Demonstration\nSystems\n\nIdentify and Study Suitable\nApplications for Wind Energy\nPrepare Facilities and Deter,\nmine Requirements for Major\nFacilities\nPhase 0 Studies\no Identify Applications for Large Impact\no Social and Environmental Impact\no Study Potential for Capital Cost Reductions\no Study Operation and Maintenance Requirements\no Economics of Wind Power\n\nFigure 2\nWIND ENERGY CONVERSION SYSTEMS\nAction Diagram\nBuild and Test\nPrototype Components\nand Subsystems\nSystems Design\nStudies of Wind\nConversion Systems Without\nStorage\nBuild and;Test\nAdvanced\nConcepts\nNASA-LeRC Design\nof 100 kW Baseline System\n\n252\n\nBuild and Field\nTest in Cleveland\n\nOperate Tested\nSystem on\nCulebra\n\nTake Over of\nOperational\nSystem by\nPuerto Rico\n\nFigure 3\nMETEOROLOGICAL STUDIES\n\nSelect Sites for Prototypes\n\nJ*\xe2\x80\x94\n\nDetermine Nation's WindEnergy Potential\nAssess Existing\nWind Data\n\nDesign of\nDemonstrations\nfor Selected\nApplications\n\nDetermine Favorable Wind\nSites\nDevelop Analytical Techniques\nfor Wind Prospecting\nMake Additional Wind\nMeasurements, Cleveland\nTest Site and Culebra\n\nFigure 4FIVE-YEAR WIND ENERGY PROGRAM\nEnergy Storage Systems\n\nStudy and\nComparative\nEvaluation of\nEnergy Storage\nSystems\n\nDesign of\nCpl pni-ori\n\nSystems\n\n\\\n\nBuild and Test\nSelected Systems\n\n/\n\nDesign of Demonstration Systems for\nSelected Applications\n\nS\n\n253\n\n"
