Voecks and\nNed W. Ferraro,\nJet Propulsion Laboratory\nContemporary regenerative liquid propellant guns typically comprise a variablevolume combustion chamber in which\ninner and outer concentric pistons cooperate to pump and meter additional propellant into the chamber as the combustion proceeds. These guns need a more\nreliable and consi tent means of ignition\nof the liquid propellant that also mitigates the occurrence of unde irable combustion oscillations that occur in the current four-step process. Thi ignitor incorporates a catalyst onto which the propellant, such as hydroxylammonium niuo.te\n(HAN) and triethanolammonium nitrate\n(TEAN), is prayed, and a heater for heating the catalyst. The catalyst is formed on\na sub trate that defines an electrical resistance heater, which heats the crystallites\non its surface to the activation energy\nnecessary for initiating the combustion.\nFor More Information Circle No. 787\n\nWe use acontrolled\nexpansion alloy to\nproduce this fiber optic\nswitch base, which must\nretain its size and shape despite\nchanges in temperoture.\n\nwas found to work well for both real-time\nhuman ob ervation and video taping.\n\nFlexured Shaft Poppet\n(u.s. Patent No. 5,577,533)\nInventor: Joseph S. Cook, Jr.,\nLyndon B. Johnson Space Center\nPoppets are commonly lIsed for closing or eating a valve eat on a valve\nopening to prevent or permit fluid flow\nthrough the opening. 10 conventional\ndesigns contaminants or components\ncan build up as a residue on sliding surfaces as a result of surface wear and other\nfactors. In the invention a tubular poppet stem or valve is constructed from a\npring material, and the wall of the stem\nhas a longitudinal section with a spiral\nconfiguration. The tubular section and\nthe spiral provide a radial, relatively stiff\nsupport along the longitudinal axis yet\npermit the stem to have a longitudinal\nspring action. The flexible wall con truction allow a ealing valve head to flex\nrelative to the longitudinal axis, so that\nseating urface on the valve head and\nopening can align themselves.\nFor More Information Circle No. 790\n\nPolarization Perception\nDevice\n(U.S. Patent No. 5,598,298)\n\nInventors: Victor S. Whitehead and\nKinsell L. Coulson,\nLyndon B. Johnson Space Center\nThe invention is a means whereby a\nhuman ob erver can vi ually perceive the\nrelative polarization of various objects in\na given scene in real time, and/ or\ndelayed time if the scene is filmed, taped,\nor photographed. A polarizing filter having opposite broad sides and a centerline\nperpendicular to those side is mounted\non a base for relative rotation with\nrespect thereto. Automatic drive means\nmove the filter angularly about its centerline at a speed slow enough to permit\nchanges in light transmission to be perceived as Hght-<lark pulses by an observer,\nbut fast enough so thal the light phase of\neach pulse occurs prior to fading of the\nimage of the preceding pulse. Thus\nspeed is coordinated with the visual enory memory so that the precise location\nand shape of objects polarizing the light\ncan be perceived as if it were continuous.\nIn a prototype, one revolution per second\n\nMethod of Implementing\nDigital Phase-locked loops\n(U.S. Patent No. 5,602,883)\n\nInventors: Scott A. Stephens and\nBrooks Thomas,\nJet Propulsion Laboratory\nPrevious analyses of digital phaselocked loops (DPLLs) are based on analog loop traditions and introduce into\nthe calculations unnecessary analog considerations such as loop-futer time constants and uncontrolled gain variations.\nThis new approach reverses the conventional design procedure for obtaining\nloop filter constants. Loop roots are first\nplaced in the -plane on the basis of new\nroot-specific damping and root-specificdecay-rate parameters. Loop constants\nare then calculated on the basis of these\nroots. With an appropriately formulated\n"digital anal ysis," DPLL theory and\ndesign become more straightforward,\nparticularly for third- and fourth-order\nloops, and loop performance is more\naccurately controlled for "high-gain"\nloops.\nFor More Information Circle No. 791\n\nABA Tech Briefs, August 1997\n\n\xc2\xb7 ..and get the best possible image,\nyou will need the Model 9400JR or\nModel 9700XLfrom Folsom Research.\n1280x1024\nComputer\nDisplay\n\nYou\'re looking at the two best autosync video scan converters available anywhere.\nBoth can tum your high-resolution desktop workstation, PC or Mac presentations into\nbroadcast-quality videos.

The WITS is\ndesigned specifically to enable scientists\nat their home institutions to control\nrobotic vehicles (called "rovers") in\nexploration of planets other than Earth,\nmaking it unnecessary for the scientists\nto travel to a central control station at\nNASA\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (see\nFigure 1) . The WITS also has obvious\npotential for adaptation to purely terrestrial use in telescience, telemedicine,\ntelerobotics, and other applications that\ninvolve remote monitoring, supervision,\ncontrol, and planning.\nThe WITS software provides an interactive display and is accessible via aJavaenabled web browser such as etscape\nNavigator. The display (see Figure 2)\nincludes an overhead plan view with a\ncolor-coded elevation map and the rover\npath and science targets drawn on it; a\nwedge view showing an actual downlink\nimage in the panorama around the\nrover, where the rover path and science\ntargets and commands are specified; a\nwedge strip showing all the images in a\npanorama side by side; and a descent\nview (not shown in the figure) showing\nan image taken by a descending rover\nwith the overall mission rover paths\ndrawn on it. A scientist can, for example,\nuse the WITS display to enter such command data as science targets for the\nrover to visit and science commands to\nperform at those targets. The scientist\ncan also view data transmitted back to\nEarth from the rover. A group of scientists at various locations can use the\nWITS to jointly plan rover activities.\nThe WITS software can be used on all\nmajor computer platforms, including\nSun, SCI, and WindQ\\YS 95. There are two\nversions of the WITS software; a mission\nversion accessible by authorized scientists\nonly, and a public version accessible by\nthe general public. The WITS public version is accessible at http: // robotics.\njpl.nasa.gov/ tasks / scirover/ operator /\nwits/ homepage.htm.\n34\n\nThis wfJrk was done by Paul C.

Users of the U enet exchange\nnews and opinions by writing articles\nand po ting them on the network,\nwhere they are transmitted automatically to other intere ted u ers. In\nUsenet news, articles are organized\ninto a hierarchy of newsgroup , which\nare subject-matter and geographical\ngroups - approximately equivalent to\nspecialized magazines, journals, and\ndi cussion groups.\nWinVN i among the first Usenet\nnews-reader programs developed\nspecifically for the Microsoft Windows\noperating system. Prior to WinVN, the\nonly such program\nusable with\nWindows were character-cell (DOS)based. Tho e programs did not provide for mouse-driven user interfaces.\nBecause those programs did not support the XOVER or REFERE CES\nnews-reader commands, they could\nnot handle heavy traffic and could not\ncross-reference the traffic. Moreover,\nbecause those programs were not\nbased on the Windows Socket stan-\n\ndard, they were not compatible with\nnetworking oftware from multiple\nvendors.\nLike other new -reader computer\nprograms , WinVN can be u ed to\nelect, view, write, sort, and print articles. Article can be saved locally, cut\ninto the Windows clipboard, or forwarded to other individual via electronic mail. In comparison with other\nnews-reader software, WinVN implements a more visual and intuitive\napproach to Usenet news.

The minimum width of conductor lines and spaces is 125 pm.\nAltogether, the chip contains 11 electrode structures, making it possible to\ntest different polymer films and/or\nmultiple film specimens of the same\npolymer. In addition, the chip contains\nthree electrical heaters for use in exerting temperature control over the polymerization of the films . Eighteen contact pins located on one edge of the\nchip provide access to the 11 test structures and heaters.\nThe design of the chip reflects a\nrequirement to be able to test polymer\nfilms that cannot be patterned after\ndeposition: the electrode structures\nprovide the required test patterns.\nThese patterns are such that the measurements taken with them yield data\non sheet resistance, surface conduction, anisotropy of conduction,\nnonuniformity, and contact resistance\nfor each film pecimen.\nThe figure illustrates the measurement circuitry used in conjunction\nwith the test chip.

Switches for this purpo e are called\n"Dicke" switches. Heretofore, various\nelectronic and mechanical Dicke switches\nhave been used. Electronic Dicke switches\noffer high switching peeds and long\noperating lifetimes but poor radio-frequency (RF) performance as characterized in terms of insertion 10 s, bandwidth,\nisolation, and return loss in the desired\nsignal frequency range of 18 to 26 GHz.\nMechanical Dicke switches have been limited in operating lifetime, reliability, and\nswitching speed.\nThe design of the present Dicke switch\novercomes some of the traditional\nmechanical switch limitations. In this\nswitch, there are no sliding or contacting\nsurfaces to wear out. The design takes\nadvantage of established loudspeakervoice-coil technology to achieve rapid\nresponse and long life.\nIn its RF aspect, the present Dicke\nswitch is based on common waveguide\nvane attenuators, which, heretofore, have\nbeen used in fine-tuning of microwave circuits. For the present application, the\nattenuator serves as an efficient, weUmatched single-pole- ingle-throw RF\nswitch. The attenuator is rapidly switched\nby a voice-coil actuator between the high\nand low attenuation limits. The attenuator vane provides the reference load (i.e.,\nthe "black-body" temperature reference)\nneeded by the radiometer.\nThe switch (see figure) is an assembly\nthat includes a slotted waveguide and an\nactuator subassembly that moves the vane\nin and out of the waveguide through the\nslots. The moving structure within the\nactuator subassembly includes a thinwalled fiberglass tube filled with expanded polystyrene. The vane is attached to\none end of the tube, and the loudspeaker\nvoice coil is wound around the other end.\nThe outer part of the actuator subassembly holds a peaker magnet at one\nend, two loudspeaker piders in the middle, and the slotted waveguide at the other\nend. The tube is approximately 4 in. (\'" 10\nem) long, so that (1) the stance between\nthe two spiders provides sufficient\nmechanical advantage to guide the tube\nalong a straight line, and (2) the vane is\nthermally insulated from the voice coil.\nThe latter requirement is important since\nthe physical temperature of the vane ele48\n\nWaveguide\n) - - - - Spider\nSuspension\n\nVane in Waveguide\n(Low-Attenuation\nor \'On\' POSition)\n\nDicke Switch Performance\nPassband\n18 to 26 GHz\nInsertion Loss (On)\n> -<l.3 dB\nInsertion Loss Repeatability\n< 0.00015 dB\nIsolation (Off)\n<-45 dB\nRetum Loss (Both Modes)\n<-40 dB\nSettling lime\n-5ms\nRadiometric Self-Heating of\nReference Load @ 5-Hz Switching < 0.03 K\nA Loudspeaker Voice Coil is used to stroke a vane into. then out of a waveguide to switch between\nhigh attenuation ("off") and low attenuation ("on") .\n\nment is the reference for the radiometer.\nA stroke of about 1/ 4 in . (\'" 6 mm) is\nneeded to move the vane into and out of\nthe waveguide, which is of a standard size\nknown in the microwave industry as "WR42." (If one were to use a waveguide of dif.\nferent size, it could be necessary to scale\nthe troke accordingly.) The slot on the\nside of the waveguide opposite the actuator subassembly allows the vane to protrude: this feature is needed to accommodate the overshoot and backlash of the\nactuator.\nThe electronic circuitry for driving the\nvoice coil includes a regulated voltage\nsource that can be switched between positive and negative polarities to move the\nvane to either of two extreme po itions.\nSwitching speed is further enhanced by\nwww.nasatech.com\n\nadding accelerating and decelerating\npulses to the driver waveform. As tested\non a prototype unit, switching speeds as\nfast as 2 rns have been demonstrated. In\npractice, however, excess heat and vibration dictate a nominal switching speed of\nabout 5 rns. At such a speed, and when\ncontinuously switching at 5 Hz, the excess\nheat produced at the vane element is Ie\nthan O.03\xc2\xb0C in the prototype unit.\nThis wark was dane I7y Alan B.

The proposed filter could be useful for rejecting background light in diverse applications, including spectroscopy, remote\nensing, optical communications, and\nlidar.\nCurrently available optical filters\nbased, variously, on birefringence and\ninterference can be tailored to desired\npass wavelengths, but in a typical case,\nthe pass band cannot be made narrower than orne tens of ang troms. Also\ncurrently available are atomic-re 0nance filters, which offer typical bandwidth of a small fraction of an\nangstrom, but the pass wavelengths are\nnot tailorable because they are limited\nto wavelengths that corre pond to a few\ndiscrete transitions between electronenergy levels in the atoms in question.\nThe proposed filters would combine\nthe tailorability of interference- and\nbirefringence-based filters with capability for narrow bandwidth of atomic-resonance filters.\nSpectral hole burning is so named\nbecause it involves exposure of an initially opaque photo-bleachable material\n(a saturable absorber) to intense illumination to create a region of transparency in part of the spectrum (a "spectral\nhole"). Photo-bleaching is highly sensitive to change in wavelength; each hole\nis transparent only to light of the same\nwavelength that created it. Thus, one\ncould u e a very-narrow-bandwidth,\nfinely tunable laser to create a hole with\na pass band at a desired wavelength (see\nfigure), and the spectral width of the\nhole would be determined by the spectral width of the laser beam. Unlike a filter based on interference and/or birefringence, a filter made by spectral hole\nburning could have a field of view\nalmost as wide as a hemisphere. It\nshould be possible to create multiple\nholes with pass bands at different wavelengths in the same filter substrate.\nOnce the hole had been created, the\nlaser would no longer be needed.\n\n54\n\n10 K to obtain long-lasting spectral\nholes, but researchers are attempting to\nidentify pectral-hole-burning materials\nthat can function as such at higher temperatures.

As its\nfull name uggests, the p-GCMS would\ncomprise a highly miniaturized combination of the much larger, much\nheavier, and non portable laboratory\ninstrumentation cu tomarily used to\nperform quantitative analysis by gas\nchromatography and mass spectrometry (GC/ MS). Of course, by virtue of\nits microminiaturization, the p-GCMS\nwould also consume much less power\nthan does a conventional laboratory\nGC/ MS apparatus.\nA sample of the gas to be analyzed\nwould enter the p-GCMS via a sampleloop-and-injection system fabricated\non a silicon chip by micromachining.\nThe miniaturization of the GC portion\nof the proposed instrument would be\nmade possible by the development of a\nmicrobore capillary column (length 2\nto 3 m, inside diameter ~ 50 pm) in\nplace of the conventional GC column.\nMolecules eluting from the GC column would be ionized as they entered\nthe mass spectrometer. The column\nwould lead directly into the ion\nsource, so that there would be no dead\nvolume in the column. The shortness\nof the column would resu lt in a short\nanalysis time.\nThe effluent gas flow in the microbore capillary column would be 0.02\n5\n3\nto 0.05 atm\xc2\xb7cm / min (3 x 10- to 8 X\n5\n3\n10- Pa\xc2\xb7m / s) - of the order of 1/100\nthat of a typical conventional GC gas\nflow. Thus, the size, weight, and power\nof the vacuum pump in the p-GCMS\ncould be much less than those of the\nvacuum pump in a conventionallaboratory GC/ MS apparatu . In addition,\nmicrobore columns are particularly\nsuitable for instruments like this one\nbecause they offer high separation\nefficiency.\nThe mass-spectral peaks of the molecules eluting from the column would\nbe narrow and closely spaced; this\ngives rise to a severe design requirement in that it would be necessary to\nacquire mass-spectral measurement\ndata at a high rate in order to characterize these peaks. To satisfy the high-\n\n56\n\ndata-rate requirement, an array detector at the focal plane of the mas spectrometer would mea ure the masspectral peaks of ions of different\nmas e simultaneously. This design\nconcept would make it po ible to utilize all of the mas spectral signal with\n100-percent duty cycle, whereas a typical conventional scanning mas spectrometer utilizes less than 1 percent of\nits signal output.\n\nwould comprise a microchannel-plate\nelectron multiplier backed by an array\nof metal anode strip with a pitch of 25\npm.

Because of the need to\nloop the coolant through the probe,\n(a oppo ed to discharging the coolant\nafter it ha flowed through the probe),\nthe cooling jacket must be relative I\nbulky. The older de ign with the bulky\ncooling jacket entails the following\nthree major di advantages:\n1. The probe inlet body is not cooled.\n2. Flowing in through the upply line\nalongside the hot return line, the\ncoolant is heated omewhat before it\nreache the cooling jacket, with a\nresultant decrease in effectiveness of\ncooling.\n3. One can compen ate for the\ndecrease in effectivene s of cooling\nby enlarging the cooling jacket, but\nin 0 doing, one lengthens the inlet\nbody and thereby reduces the frequency respon e of the probe.\nA probe of the pre ent improved\ndesign is illustrated in the figure. The\nprimary coolant enters the probe along\nthe primary supply tube, then flows\nthrough the stem hollow along the\ntransducer well. Most of the primary\nflow is then discharged into the hot\nenvironment through exit holes, the\nnumbers and position of which are\nchosen to suit the thermal and flow\nconditions.\nThe secondary coolant is delivered\nthrough the secondary up ply tube\ninto the back cavity in the inlet sleeve.\nThe secondary coolant then flows from\nthe back cavity along the sleeve clearance to the tip of the inlet body, where\nit is discharged. This arrangement\nminimizes the distance between the tip\nof the inlet body and the transducer,\nand thereby helps to maximize the frequency response of the probe. The secondary supply tube i insulated from\nthe probe stem by the primary flow of\ncoolant, and thus the econdary flow\nof coolant does not pick up heat\nbefore it reaches the inlet body. Some\nof the primary flow is discharged\nthrough the supply hole into the sleeve\nclearance, where it joins the secondary\nflow. The combined secondary/ primary coolant discharged at the probe tip\nflows along the outer surface of the\nprobe sleeve, providing additional\nevaporative cooling (if the coolant i a\nliquid) or film cooling (if the coolant\nis a gas).\n\nThis work was done by Jan Lepicovsky of\nNYMA, Inc., for Lewis Research Center .\n\nASA Tech Briefs, August 1997\n\nFor further information, access the Technical\nSupport Package (TSP) free on-line at\nwww.nasatech.com under the Physical\nSciences category, or circle no. 11 0 on the\nTSP Order card in this issue to receive a cofrY\nby mail ( 5 charge).\nInquiries concerning rights for the com-\n\nmercial use of this invention should be\naddressed to NASA Lewis Research Center,\nCommercial Technology Office, Attn: Tech\nBrief Patent Status, Mail Stop 7-3, 21000\nBrookpark Road, Cleveland, Ohio 44135.\nRefer to LEW-16301.\n\nSecondary Supply Tube\n\nPrimary Supply Tube\n\nS\n\n-GMS\n\nSL-Graphicat Modeling System\n\nCreate brilliant interfaces\nwitb tbis dY1lamic-graphics\nrun-time engille embedded\nin your application\nBuilds, runs, and manages animated\ninterfaces and connects them to your\ndata sources for dynamic display and\ninteractive control of fully visualized,\nreal-time applications.\n\nMounting Attachment\n\nSL-GMS is continually evolving\nand improving to meet developers\'\nincreasingly complex needs.

The baseline design of\nthe device is for operation between temperatures of 140 and 60 Kin a cryogenic\nsystem that would be used to cool arrays\nof infrared detectors to either of two\nselectable temperatures. The functionality of the device extends beyond the\nbaseline temperature range, enabling\noperation at temperatures between 14\nand 300 K.\nAs in other gas-gap thermal switches,\nthe effective thermal conductance of a\ngap between two metal surfaces is\nincreased or decreased by increasing or\ndecreasing, respectively, the pressure of\na suitable gas in the gap. In this device,\nthe gap is 0.0015 in . (0.038 mm) thick,\n2\nwith a cross-sectional area of 1.63 in.\n(10.5 cm\\ The gap is formed between\ntwo precise conical metal surfaces that\nare spring-loaded toward each other by a\nretaining spring and held apart by\nrecessed columns made of fiberglass\ncomposite or other strong, thermally\ninsulating material. The metal surfaces\nthat face each other across the gap are\ncoated with gold to minimize radiative\ntransfer of heat across the gap when the\nswitch is in the "off\' state.\nThis conical-gap design is preferable\nto an alternative design for a gas gap\nformed between multiple interleaved\nfins, for the following reasons: In the\ncase of interleaved fins, gradients of temperature and the attendant differential\nthermal expansion can be large enough\nto bring the facing metal surfaces into\ncontact, so that, in effect, the switch\nbecome short-circuited. In contrast, the\nconical interface disturbs the heat-flux\npattern minimally, so that it is po ible to\navoid large temperature gradients and\nthereby\nprevent\nhort-circuiting.\nMoreover, the smoother flow of heat\nacross the conical gap causes less of an\nundesired increase in thermal resistance\nwhen the switch is in the "on~ state.\nThe gas gap is enclosed by a flexible\nleak-tight outer shell, which introduces\nsome undesired thermal coupling\nbetween the two ends of the switch in\nthe "off\' state. This thermal coupling\ncan be minimized by designing the\nouter shell to form a long, thin thermal\npath. Accordingly, the outer shell is\nmade of a combination of thin-wall\ntubes and bellows. The outer-shell material is a 300-series stainless steel, which\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 1997\n\nhas low (relative to typical other metals)\nthermal conductivity.\nThe gas chosen for use in this switch is\nhydrogen, which provides high thermal\nconductivity and has the second lowest\ntriple-point temperature (14 K) of all\nknown working fluids. It is the choice of\nhydrogen that enables operation over\nthe temperature range from 14 to 300 K.\nThe gap volume communicates with a\nvolume that contains an electrically\n\nheated zirconium-nickel hydride sorbent bed, which supplies the hydrogen\nto (or withdraws it from) the gap. The\nheating element is a thin film of platinum on a ceramic substrate.\nBecause the electrical resistivity of\nplatinum is a known function of temperature, the heating element can also be\nused as a thermometer.

The pressure of hydrogen in the gap (and thus the thermal conductance of the switch) is controlled by controlling the temperature\nof the hydride sorbent bed.\n\nnickel hydride are known functions of\ntemperature, the thermal conductance\nof the device can be controlled via temperature of the hydride bed. Thus, the\nswitch can be turned "on" (set to maximum thermal conductance), turned\n"off\' (set to minimum thermal conductance), or set to a desired intermediate\nlevel of thermal conductance by suitable\ncontrol and monitoring of the electrical\npower supplied to the heater.\nIn tests, the switch exhibited "on"- tate\n\nthermal resistances of about 1 K/W at\nheat flows up to 8 W and operating temperatures above 100 K Temperaturedependent "off\'-state thermal resistances\nranged from 600 to 900 K/W. In particular, the "off\'-state thermal resistance for\noperation between 60 and 140 was 660\nK/W, and the "on"-state thermal resistance at 140 K was 0.92 K/W; the\n"off\'lOon" switching thermal-resistance\nratio was thus 660/0.92 = 717.

For example, a resonator of\nthis type would generate blue or ultraviolet light when excited by infrared or visible light from a diode laser. Microspheres\ntypically have diameters that range from\n62\n\ntens to hundreds of micrometers and\ncould be integrated with diode lasers to\nmake small, efficient sources of coherent\nblue or ultraviolet light\nThe microspheres would be sized, in\nconsideration of the linear and nonlinear components of their dielectric properties, to support "whispering-gallery"\nresonant electromagnetic-wave modes at\nwww.oasatech.com\n\nthe desired wavelengths. Studies have\nshown that using microspheres made of\npractical dielectric materials, it should be\npo ible to achieve the high quality fac7\ntors (Q ~ 10 ) in the whispering-gallery\nmodes, enabling sufficient buildup of\nelectromagnetic fields in those modes to\ngenerate useful amounts of second-harmonic radiation. [The quality factor (Q)\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 1997\n\nof a resonator is a measure of the harpness of its resonance in the given mode\nand is defined as 2n: x the energy tored\nin the electromagnetic field in the resonator .;- the energy dissipated per cycle\nof oscillation.)\nThe whispering-gailery modes of a\ndielectric microsphere represent electr<r\nmagnetic fields confined by internal\nreflection to an interior region do e to\nthe surface of the sphere. For a micr<r\nphere with a diameter ~ 10 \\lm, the\ndimension of the resonator is much larger than the wavelength of light. Thus, the\nloss due to the finite curvature of the resonator is negligible, resulting in a high Q\nthat is limited mainly by the attenuation\nof the light in the dielectric material.\nThe design of a microsphere resonator involves numerical solution of\nequations that contain Bessel and\nHankel functions that describe the whispering-gallery modes. The candidate\nsolutions are those that support both the\nfundamental and the second-harmonic\nwaves and that satisfy two phase-matching conditions. The first phase-matching\ncondition - essential for the generation\nof the second harmonic - is that the\ntotal phase change suffered by a wavefront that starts from a given point in the\nsphere and propagates through the\nsphere, returning to the starting point,\nmust be an integer multiple of27t radians\nfor both the fundamental and the second-harmonic wave. The second phasematching condition - to ensure maximum transfer of power from the fundamental to the second harmonic - is that\nthe phase difference between the fundamental and second-harmonic waves in\nthe sphere is n:/2 radians, so that the\nantinodes of the second-harmonic wave\ncoincide with the antinodes of the nonlinear-polarization wave in the sphere.\nBecause the simplest approach to fabrication of rnicrospheres involves melting, a nonlinear-dielectric material that\nretain the de ired optical propertie\nwould be de irable. A likely candidate\nmaterial for this approach is DAST,\nwhich is a crystalline material that retains\nits properties, including its crystal-axis\norientation, after a melt. As an example,\na DAST sphere with a diameter of25 \\lm\nwould support the appropriate whispering-gallery modes and satisfy the phasematching conditions for generating second-harmonic light with a wavelength of\n400 nm from input radiation at a fundamental wavelength of 800 nm. The calculated Q values of both the fundamental and the second-harmonic whispering9\ngallery modes exceed 10 .\nTwo problems that arise in practical\napplications are those of tuning and of\ncoupling radiation into and out of the\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 1997\n\nmicrospheres. Tuning could likely be\neffected by distorting the microspheres\nmechanically, perhaps by use of the\npiezoelectric effect. The coupling problem has already been solved in principle;\na fundamental-frequency evane cent\nwave could be coupled into a rnicr<r\nsphere via a first prism or fiber, while a\nsecond-harmonic evanescent wave could\nbe coupled out of the microsphere by\nuse of a second prism or fiber located\ndiametrically oppo ite the first prism.\nBy a suitable variation in the choice of\nwhispering-gailery modes, it would be\npossible to use a microsphere resonator\nof this type as a parametric oscillator. For\n\nexample, for parametric down-conversion, the design would be based on dividing the frequency of an input pump wave\n(vp) into the frequencies of (\\\\10 subbarmonies (VI and v!), which would be designated as the signal and idler waves,\nrespectively.\nThis work was done by Lutfollah Maleki of\nCaltech for NASA\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

These ion\ndetectors are intended principally for\nuse in a new generation of highly miniaturized, portable mass pectrometers.\nHeretofore, the mass-spectral images\nof ions dispersed along the focal planes\nof mas pectrometers have been converted to electron images and intensified in microchannel-plate (MCP) elecSa\n\ntron multiplier. Unfortunately, MCP\nelectron multipliers are vulnerable to\ndisruption of electron trajectories by\nfringing magnetic fields at the output\nends of the spectrometer mas - eparation sectors. In addition, MCP electron\nmultipliers require both high potentials\n(1 to 3 kV) and high vacuum [maximum residual yressure of about 10~\ntorr (about 10 Pa)] for proper operation.\nwww.nasatech.com\n\nThe developmental ion detectors do\nnot require high potential. They can\noperate at much higher residual pressure [up to about 10-\' torr (about 10-1\nPa)], which are consistent with the relatively high maximum operating pressures of the mass-separation sectors of\nhighly miniaturized mass spectrometers. These features reduce the vacuumpumping and electric-power demand,\nthereby contributing to progress toward\nAugust 1997\n\nminiaturi.zation. In addition, the developmental ion detectors\ncan be made relatively invulnerable to fringing magnetic fields,\nas explained below.\nAn ion detector of the present type (see figure) includes a\nfiber-optic faceplate, one face of which is coated with a phosphor (for example, Zn~iOi:Mn) and placed in the focal plane\nof a mass spectrometer. Mounted on the other face of the fiberoptic faceplate is an integrated-circuit image sensor which\ncould be a charge-coupled device (CCD) imaging array or an\narray of photodiodes or active-pixel sensors. In the mass spectrometer, ions are accelerated to kinetic energies in the\napproximate range of 1 to 2 ke . After traversing the masHeparation sector, the ions impinge on the phosphor.\nLuminescence excited by the ions impinging at a given position is guided via the local optical fibers to the photodetector\nat the con-esponding position on the opposite face of the fiberoptic faceplate. In a case in which the performance of the\nimage sensor could be adversely affected by the fringing magnetic field, one can simply mount the image sensor outside the\nfringing magnetic field by use of a fiber-optic faceplate of sufficient thickness.\n\n"NEW" "NEW" "NEW"\nSEE YOUR UV AND INFRARED\nThe FIND-R-SCOPE\xc2\xae 84499 Series are the most widely\nused infrared viewers.

Unlike the magnetic-field-sensitive ion detectors now\nu ed in laboratory mass spectrometer,\nthe proposed ion detectors could perform well without special attention to\ntheir geometric relation hips with the\nfringing magnetic fields at the focal\np lanes of the magnetic ma s-separation\nsectors of the spectrometer. The net\nresult would be that the mass spectrometer could be made impler, more\ncompact, more rugged, less expensive,\nand capable of higher mass resolution.\nA description of a conventional ion\ndetector in a conventional laboratory\nmass spectrometer is prerequisite to an\nexplanation of the proposed ion detectors. The ion leaving the magnetic sector impinge on a multichannel-plate\n(MCP) electron multiplier, which pro4\nduces approximately 10 electrons per\nion. The e electrons are accelerated\n(typically to a kinetic energy between 4\nand 5 keY) to a phosphor-coated fiberoptic plate to produce an image in\nwhich spots of light at different locations represent ion of different masses. This image is detected by an array of\nphotodiodes.\nThe front surface of the phosphor is\ncoated with an electrically conductive\nlayer of aluminum to prevent electrical\ncharging of the phosphor. To minimize\nthe probability that the electron-accelerating electric field will cause electrical breakdown, it is nece sary to maintain a gap at least 1 mm wide between\nthe back surface of the MCP electron\nmultiplier and the phosphor. However,\nthe fringing magnetic field acting over\na gap as wide as this can affect the trajectorie of the accelerated electrons to\nsuch an extent that many or all of them\nare diverted away from the phosphor.\nIn a typical design to reduce the\nadverse effect of the fringing magnetic\nfield, the pole piece of the magnetic\nector are modified to configure the\nfringing field more favorably, and the\nphosphor-coated fiber-optic plate is tilted with respect to the focal plane.\nUnfortunately, these corrective measures di tort and dislocate the focal\nplane in relation to the phosphor,\nthereby distorting the rna s- pectral\nimage and degrading its resolution.\nlOa\n\nThi completes the de cription of a\nconventional ion detector.\nIn an ion detector according to the\npropo al, the effect of the fringing\nmagnetic field would be reduced by\nreducing the width of the MCP/ pho phor gap to about 25 to 100 pm ( ee\nfigure). To prevent electrical breakdown in this small gap, the electronaccelerating potential would have to be\nreduced correspondingly, giving ri e to\na pho phor that could be excited by\n\nBecau e it would be relatively in enitive to the fringing magnetic field, it\nwould not be necessary to tilt the detector away from the focal plane, nor\nwould it be nece ary to modify the\npole piece.

Some work is oriented toward decontamination and decommissioning (D&D) of nuclear facilities; other\nwork is oriented toward removal of coatings on aircraft parts for\ninspection for microcracks. F2 Associates has contracts from the\nDepartment of Energy and the U.S. Air Force/ SERDP to develop industrial-\xc2\xb7scale systems for both kinds of work. Goals include\n(1) automation using robots; (2) capture and filter all removed\nmaterial; (3) clean out surface pores; (4) no mechanical, thermal, or chemical damage to the substrate; (5) eliminate use of\nchemicals, reduce waste volume, and enhance worker safety.\nIn the process of developing these larger systems, a small\nsystem was built for testing to determine the proper laser\nparameters for various coatings on various substrates. That\nsmall system is now ready for commercialization for decoating small parts. It consists of a 150-W (average power) pulsed\nCO 2 laser, a short beam delivery into a "fume hood," vacuum\nand filtration (HEPA and charcoal) for the hood to handle\nall particulates, gases, and vapors, an X-V translator for scann ing (moving) the parts in front of the laser beam for\ndecoating, and laser eye protection.\nThe system is especially good at removing hydrocarbon-based\ncoatings like lead-based paint, epoxy, oil-based paint, inks, etc.\nThese can be removed a thin layer at a time if desired. And the\nlaser parameters are such that binders like linseed in lead-based\npaint are reduced to simpler-molecule gases and vapors that\ncan be filtered and released, resulting in waste volume reduction and saving on disposal costs.\nAs one example, the Department of Defense is refurbishing\ncircuit cards that are potted in a type of epoxy. The potting\nmust be removed, the backside contacts desoldered, and the\ncomponents tested to frnd, remove, and replace the defective\none( ), and then they must be repotted. Currently the decoating is done with hazardous chemicals that the EPA wants\nphased out, and decoating-process damage levels are noticeable. The following process has been demonstrated with the F2\nsystem: Dry-decoat (laser-ablate) only the potting on the back of\nthe card, and test to find the defective component. Turn the\ncard over, depot only that component, and remove and replace\nit. Then spot-repot the front and repot the back. The proces is\ndry, uses no chemicals, and is done in a filtered chamber.\nThere are many other applications. F2 invites prospective\ncustomers to bring in amples fo r testing. The unit can be customized in size of the fume hood, part-holder. can\nspeed/ mode, and on-target laser power density for individual\nneeds, using commercially available components.\nThis work was done by a team of employees ofF2 Associates Inc.\nTechnowgy base work was supported by the Dept. of Energy (contract\nDE-AR21-94MC30359, S.

Plate wave analysis has shovm that\nacoustic velocities are indicative of some\nmechanical properties of the material specifically, stiffness moduli. By making\nit po ible to measure such velocities\nnonde tructively and without direct\nmechanical contact, the present technique could prove useful in such tasks as\nmeasuring changing mechanical proJF\nerties during thennomechanical testing\nor monitoring otherwi e inaccessible\nstructural components during use to\nobtain indication of deterioration.\nThough the implementation of the\ntechnique involves orne moderately\ncomplex electronic signal and data pro12a\n\ncessing, the basic principle of the technique is imple: One uses a pulsed beam\nfrom a neodymium: yttrium aluminum\ngarnet ( d:YAG) laser to excite an\nacoustic pulse at one end of a plate specimen, and use an air-coupled, focusing\npiezoelectric transducer to measure the\nacoustic signal at some other position\nalong the specimen (see figure). The\noutput of the tran ducer is digitized and\nanalyzed to identify pulses that indicate\narrival of the initial acoustic pulse and\nsubsequently of echoes. This analysis is\naided by a trigger signal supplied by a\nlaser-pulse-energy sensor; this signal provides a time reference for measuring\npulse delays, which, in turn, are used to\ncalculate velocities.\nOne acoustic velocity of particular\ninterest is the velocity of the first antiwww.nasatech.com\n\nsymmetric plate wave mode. In previous\nstudies, this mode has been shown to\ndominate the frequency pectra of the\nacoustic signals in CMC plate specimens. The velocity is sensitive to the\nshear and flexure moduli of materials;\nin the case of reaction-bonded silicon\nnitride composite materials, it is also\nsensitive to the fiber/ matrix interfacial\nshear strength.\nThe feasibility of this non contact\ntechnique was demonstrated in experiments on 20-percent-porous SiC/ SiC\ncomposite tensile specimens with three\ndifferent fiber layups. The shear-wave\nvelocities of the specimens as determined by this technique were found to\nbe approximately in agreement with\nshear-wave velocities measured with\ncontact ultrasonic transducers.\nAugust 1997\n\nAir-Coupled.

The acoustic\nsignal IS sampled at one spot by use of an air-coupled, focusing transducer.\n\nA side effect of interest in its own right\nwas ob erved during the experiments:\nRepeated laser pulsing at the same location led to deterioration of the ultrasonic signal, though the ignal recovered\nafter about 24 hours. The mechanism of\nthe deterioration was initially conjectured to be evaporation of a regenerating urface layer (possibly from water\nvapor) that is nece ary for rransforming\nthe laser energy to ultrasonic energy.\nHowever, attempts to accelerate reco\\,ery by applying water were unsucces ful.\nThis work was done l7y H aroid E.

Similar materials iliat\nbeen reported previously in NASA Tech\nBriefs include PS-212 (deposited by plasma spraying), PM-212 (made by powder\nmetallurgy), and EX-212 (a variant of\nPM-212 formed by extrusion). All of the\n"\'212" materials have the same average\nchemical composition and are made\nfrom the same ingredients: 70 weight\npercent metal-bonded chromium carbide, 15 weight percent silver, and 15\nweight percent of a eutectic mixture of\nbarium and calcium fluorides.\nMS-212 was developed for applications\nin which solid PM-212 bearings cannot\nbe used and there are requirements for\nsolid lubricant coats that conform closely\nto the topographies of substrates and are\nthinner than the coats customarily pHr\nduced by plasma spraying. Both PM-212\nand PS-212 have relatively coarse\nmicrostructures with segregation of phases; thus, they are not suitable for making\nthin conformal coats. Moreover, PM-212\nand PS-212 must be machined to final\ndimensions. On the other hand, MS-212\nin the as-deposited condition has the requisite homogeneity and smoothness (see\nfigure), and can be used without machining or surface finishing.\nThe friction and wear properties of\n\nMS-212 were evaluated in tests in which\nhemispherically tipped pins were slid on\ndisks while pressing against the disks\nwith known forces. Some of the pins\nwere made of aluminum oxide, others of\na cobalt-base alloy. Some of the disks\nwere made of a soft aluminum alloy, others of a nickel-base turbine alloy. Some\nof the disks of each alloy were left bare,\nwhile others of each type were coated\nwith MS-212. The tests with aluminum\ndisks were performed at ambient temperarure, while the tests with nickel-alloy\ndisks were performed at temperatures\nfrom ambient to 800 \xc2\xb7C.\nThe following are some of the conclusions drawn from the results of the tests:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 In sliding against both cobalt-alloy and\naluminum oxide pins, the aluminumalloy disks coated with MS-212 exhibited less friction and greater resistance to\nwear than did the bare aluminum-alloy\ndisks. The MS-212 coatings also prevented the severe galling typical of aluminum in sliding tests. However, the\nlubricating property ofMS-212 on a soft\nmetal like this aluminum alloy is loadlimited in the sense that at high applied\nload, the soft substrate material deforms plastically, with resultant cracking\nand spalling of the hard MS-212.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 In sliding against cobalt-alloy pins at\nambient temperature and at 350 \xc2\xb7C,\nand in sliding against aluminum oxide\n\nMS212 AS DEPOSITED ON A POUSHED SURFACE\n\npins at all test temperatures from 25 to\n800\xc2\xb0C, the nickel-alloy disks coated\nwith MS-212 exhibited les friction\nthan did the bare nickel-alloy disks.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 At temperatures of 25 and 350\xc2\xb0C, the\nalumina pins that were slid against nickel-alloy disks with 20-pm-thick coats of\nMS-212 exhibited less wear than did the\nalumina pins that were slid against bare\nnickel-alloy disks. However, at temperatures of 600 and 800 \xc2\xb7C, the alumina\npins that were slid against the 20-pmMS-212-coated disks exhibited somewhat more wear than did the alumina\npins that were slid against bare nickelalloy disks; this result has been tentatively attributed to the formation of\nlubricous oxides on the nickel-alloy\ndisks at these high temperatures.\nThis wark was done by Harold E.

Thi wheel i\nal 0 capable of meeting tringent\ndynamic balance requirements. Originally de igned for u e as parts of attitude-control sy terns of spacecraft, this\nand older reaction/ inertia/ momentum\nwheel could also be u ed on Earth for example, to aim optical in truments\nthat are carried aboard moving bases\nlike aircraft, ships, or land vehicles.\nThe term "reaction/inertia/momentum" i used here to reflect the fact that\nmachines of thi type have been called\n"reaction wheels," "inertia wheel," and\n"momentum wheels" on different occasions and because each of these terms\nrepre ents an aspect of the basic principle of operation. The major functional\nblock of a reaction / inertia/ momentum\nwheel is a flywhee l driven by an electric\nmotor equipped with Hall-effect sensors\nfor measuring its shaft angle and speed,\nand with its axi of rotation coincident\nwith that of the instrument to be aimed.\nTo initiate rotation of the instrument\ntoward a commanded angular position,\nan attitude- ensing-and-control subsystem causes the motor to apply a torque\nto the flywheel; the rotational inertia of\nthe flywheel reacts against the torque,\napplying an equal and opposite torque\nback through the motor to the instrument, and angularly accelerates the\nin trument in the commanded direction\nat the commanded rate. The term\n"momentum" refers to the angular\nmomentum that i stored in the rotation\nof the flywheel.\nThe figure pre ents\nimplified\nmeridional-plane cross sections of a\ntypical older reaction / inertia/ momentum wheel and of the pre ent improved\nversion. Wherea the flywheel in the\nolder version i mounted on the haft\nat an intermediate position between\nthe bearings, the flywheel in the preent version is mounted in cantilever\nfashion at the tip of a portion of the\nshaft that protrude beyond one of the\nbearings. The different configuration\nfor supporting the flywheel in the preent version makes it po ible to u e a\nmailer and les massive housing to\nsupport the bearing. As a result, the\ntorque-to-weight ratio in the pre ent\nver ion is about 50 percent greater\nthan that of the older ver ion.\n66\n\nIn the older version, the flywheel i\ninacce ible once it i mounted on the\nshaft; therefore, the flywheel mu t be\nbalanced before in talling it on the\nshaft, and there i no way to correct for\nan residual imbalance in the shaft itself,\nor for misalignment between the flywheel and haft. In the pre ent version,\nthe flywheel is still acce ible for balancing when it is mounted on the shaft; con-\n\nequentl , it is po ible to balance the\nmounted flywheel to com pen ate more\npreci ely for imbalance in the entire\nrotating mas to minimize vibrations\nduring operation, which reduce pacecraft jitter.\nThe bearing lubricant in the pre ent\nversion i cho en with regard to requirements to minimize leakage, evaporation,\nand frictional torque.

After tests of many different lubricants, the one that\nwas cho en is a die ter-based grease that contains a lithiumbased-soap additive and that has been filtered to remove all\nparticle larger than 10 pm. The choice of a grease is contrary\nto the tendency to choose an oil on the basis of the intuitive\n(but in this case incorrect) expectation that the lower viscosity\nof an oil would result in less bearing friction. An additional\nadvantage of this choice is that there is no need for the extra\neals, channels, and reservoirs that would be necessary to contain an oil, and the difficulty and cost of fabrication are\nreduced accordingly.\nThis work was d{)ne by Charles Edward Clagett ofGoddard Space\nFligh t Center.

Heretofore, welding filler metals with compositions matched to those of -y-TiAl-based alloys could be\nmade only by coextrusion, using canned assemblies of cast\nrods and/ or ingots.

DPLAN accepts\ninformation about the equipment configurations and reque ted tracking seIVices\nas inputs, which it utilizes in conjunction\nwith its knowledge base of antenna operation procedures. Then by using the\nArtificial-Intelligence planning techniques of Hierarchical-task-network and\noperator-based planning, DPLAN produces a plan (sequence) of activities to\nprovide the requested eIVices and to configure equipment for thi purpose.\nContinuing efforts in the development of\nDPLAN are focused on issues of knowledge representation, reasoning about the\nrelative merits of alternative plans, repreentation of information pertaining to\nreal-time changes in equipment and\nrequested services, and replanning\n(before or during operation) in response\nto changes in equipment, seIVice , or evaluations of alternative plans.\nDPLAN is a general-purpose planning\nengine implemented in C, which has\nbeen succe sfully applied to other procedure automation tasks, such as image\nprocessing. Using DPLAN for a new\ndomain simply requires creating the\nappropriate knowledge base. The knowledge base consists of task decomposition\nrules and task definitions. The decomposition rules are "if-then" type rules, which\npecify how high-level abstract tasks are\ndecompo ed into smaller low-level rule\nor executable tasks. These rule allow for\nthe creation of a modular knowledge\nbase which eparate abstract knowledge\nfrom lower-level detailed knowledge.\nChange in the pecific detail of a\ndomain (for example, in the DS\ndomain if a new piece of equi pmen t were\nto be added) only affect the lower-level\nrules and do not require change in the\nhigher-level abstract rules. Additionally,\ntask definitions can be specified that\ndescribe the preconditions and postconditions of a given task. The preconditions\nare nece ary states or events that must\noccur before the given task, and the po t70\n\ncondition are the effects of executing\nthat task. The planner then en ure that\nthe preconditions are sati fied and also\ntracks the po tconditions that may in turn\nbe the precondition of other tasks.\nDPLAN\' algorithm uses both the decompo ition rule and the task definitions to\ndetermine a correct executable plan of\nactivitie . All interaction between tasks\nare tracked, and DPLAN ensure that\nthere are no conflicts in the final plan.\nThis program was written by Steve Chien,\nAnita Govindjee, Tara Estlin, XueMei\nWang, Randall Hill, Jr., and Forest Fisher of\nCaltech for NASA\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

This is an important\ndevelopmen t in that many flows of practical importance are bounded by moving\nsurfaces: examples include internal\nflows driven by pistons, biofluids\n(blood) moving within elastic boundaries (blood vessels and the heart) , and\nexternal flows over moving control surfaces of aircraft.\nAspects of the fixed-grid version of the\nmethod were described in several prior\narticles in NASA Tech Briefs, including\n"Fractional-Step, Finite-Volume Computation of Flow" (ARC-12621), Vol. 16,\nNo. 2 (February 1992), page 80; "A\nFractional-Step Method of Computing\nIncompressible Flow" (ARC-13154), Vol.\n17, No.2 (February 1993), page 78; and\n"Multi grid, Fractional-Step Computation of Flow" (ARC-13196), Vol. 20,\n\n~\n\no. 3 (March 1996) , page 78. To recapitulate: The avier-Stokes equations of\nincompressible flow are solved numerically on a general nonorthogonal cunrilinear coordinate grid, using finite volumes defined by the grid and by using\nvolume fluxes (instead of velocities) to\naccount for the finite volumes of the\ngrid cells. The pressure is the remaining\ndependent flow-field variable. At each\ntime step, computations are performed\nin two fractional steps. In the first fractional step, the equations of conservation of momentum are solved by use of\nthe gradient of pressure from the preceding time step via an explicit approximate-factorization method, yielding an\napproximate flow field that does not satisfy the equation of conservation of\nmass. In the second fractional step, a discrete Poisson-like equation with\nNeumann-type boundary conditions,\nformed by combining the equations of\nconservation of momentum and mass, is\nsolved iteratively.\nThe extension of the fixed-grid ver-\n\nsion of the method to a moving grid\nbegins with a return to the original\nintegral formulation of the NavierStokes and conservation equations\nthat was used to derive the fixed-grid\nversion. The motion of the grid is\nincorporated into the equations via\nterms in the velocity of each surface\nelement in the grid and in the time\ndependence of the geometry (volume\nand surface-element areas) of each\ngrid cell. To preserve accuracy in the\nfinite-volume discretization, special\nattention is paid to the satisfaction of\ngeometric conservation laws in the\nmoving coordinate system (these laws\nrelate the volumes and the areas of the\nsurface elements of the computational\ncells in such a way as to enforce the\nconservation of volume ., which is\nequivalent to tbe conservation of mass\nin the case of incom pressibili ty).\nIn the fixed-grid version of the\nmethod, an explicit approximation of\nthe convection terms is used. In the moving-grid version, the convection terms\n\nWhat can IRIS Explorer help you see?\n\nCosmIc SlrilJgs and unJl C1\'St\' conloul\'S made Itslble !11th IE 3.0 on a DEC 3000 with 256,m RAM.\n\ndJ:::m=\na::\n\nI am a theoreUcaI cosmologl I stu~1ng the OI1gJn and structure of the Meti/caJ Imagillg, chellllslly,\nuniverse.

The MACS\nfunctions in any orientation, including\nvertical or upside-down. Under remote\ncontrol or onboard computer control,\nthe MACS can be maneuvered so that\nthe equipment that it carries can\ninspect aircraft and marine structures\nfor such defects as dents, cracks, corrosion, impact damage, delamination,\nfire damage, and porosity. The MACS\ncould also perform such other tasks as\nremoving paint and carrying hazardous\nmaterials.\nThe MACS includes a p latform, on\nwhich are mounted two piezoelectricmotor-driven legs; a U-shaped outer leg\nand a round inner leg. Both legs are\nequipped with suction cups (see figure)\nto grip the surface on which the MACS\ncrawls. A miniature onboard computer\ncoordinates the operations of the suction cups and legs. For example, initially, the cups on the inner leg are evacuated and extended to the surface to\ngrip the surface, while the cups on the\n\nouter leg are not evacuated and are\nwithdrawn from the surface so that the\nouter leg is free to move. The outer leg\nis then translated to the next step position. When nece sary, the platform can\nalso be rotated on the inner leg to\nchange the direction of translation\nand/ or orient the platform for a specific task. ext, the cup on the outer leg\nare extended toward the surface and\nevacuated, air is admitted to the cups\non the inner leg to release their grip,\nthese cups are withdrawn from the surface , and the inner leg is translated so\nthat it catches up with the outer leg.\nThe cycle is then repeated.\nThe partial vacuums in the cups are\nproduced by small venturi pumps that\noperate on shop compressed air, which\nis usually available at pressures from 70\nto 120 psi (0.48 to 0.83 MPa). Each cup\nis connected to a separate pump, so that\nif one cup loses vacuum on a rough surface, the others on the leg still grip the\nsurface. The same supply of compressed\nair used to generate suction is also used\nto extend the suction cups toward the\nsurface for gripping.\nThe platform can carry any of a variety\n\nof modules; for example, a video camera\nfor visual inspection, ultrasonic or eddycurrent instrumentation to detect invisible flaws, or a source of heat to remove\npaint. The MACS weighs about 10 lb (4.5\nkg) and can carry payloads weighing up\nto about 100 lb (45 kg) .\nThis work was done by Yoseph Bar-Cohen,\nBenjamin Joffe, and Paul Backes of Caltech\nfor NASA\'s J et Propulsion Laboratory.\nFor further information, access the Technical\nSupport Package (TSP) free on-line at\nunuw.nasatech.com under the Machinery/\nAutomation category, or circle no. 156 on\nthe TSP Order card in this issue to receive a\ncopy by mail ($5 charge).\nIn accordance with Public Law 96-517,\nthe contractor has elected to retain title to this\ninvention.

The e masks are imilar to lithographic masks of ol~er design,\nthe major difference being that in the e\nmasks the attenuator materials and the\nthickne es of the attenuators are cho en\nto minimize the blurring effect of diffraction at the edge .\nFigure 1 illustrates a typical mask used\nin oft-x-ray (wavelength of the order of 1\nnm) lithography. The shadowing and\nnon hadowing areas of the mask are u ed\nto define feature in a radiation- ensitive\nfilm during exposure to illumination in a\ncontact or proximity printing process. In\nthe older approach to mask de ign, one\npays no particular attention to the difference between the phase of radiation passing through the openings and the phase\nof the small amount of radiation that survives passage through the attenuator, or\nelse one sets this phase shift close to zero.\nIn practice, the mask and the film to be\npatterned are often mounted with a gap\nof the order of tens of microns between\nthem to prevent them from damaging\neach other. In the pre ence of such a gap,\ndiffraction at the edge of the attenuator\nreduces the steepness of the transition in\nintensity of illumination between the\nshadowed and nonshadowed areas of the\nfilm; this blurring effect makes it difficult\nor impossible to define lithographically\nthe edges of submicron feature that one\nseeks to fabricate.\n\nThe pre ent approach to mask de ign i\nbased on the dependence of diffraction\nupon the open-area/ attenuator phase difference. The dependence is uch that one\ncan maximize the teepness of the intenity tran ition at an edge by choo ing the\nattenuator material and thickn\nuch\nthat the phase difference i an odd integer multiple of 1t radians. Contrary to\nintuition, the teepening effect is greater\nwith partial than it is with total attenuation. A typical useful, though not nece&sarily optimal, value of attenuation is\nabout 10 dB; the optimum value depends\non the pecific application. In practice,\nthe spectrum of x-rays used in lithography\nusually spans a band of wavelengths, 0\nthat it is nece ary to select a domjnant or\nrepresentative wavelength in the band for\nwhich the phase shift is to be set to an\ninteger odd multiple of 1t radians. The\nattenuator thickne and compo ition are\nthen chosen together to obtain the\nrequired phase hift and degree of attenuation: the attenuator can be tailored by\nchoice of thickne es and compo itions of\nmultiple layers and/or by choice of the\nthickne and composition of an alloy.\nFigure 2 illustrates the beneficial effect\nof a 1t-phase-shift attenuator in the case of\na mask with a slit 250 nm wide in a 10-dB\nattenuator and illumination in the wavelength band of 1.2 \xc2\xb1 0.036 nm.
