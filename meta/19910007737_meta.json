Collecting technology needs from individual programs/vehicles and proposed technology items from individual developers usually results in a mismatch and something that is unaffordable. A strategy to address this problem is outlined with task definitions which will lead to avionics advanced development items that will fit within an overall framework, prioritized to support budgeting, and support the scope of NASA space transportations needs.", "title": "Avionics advanced development strategy", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T14:13:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19910007737, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Dyer, D."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Headquarters", "location": "Washington, DC United States"}}, "id": "ac2fdeebf64441c2bcc45198d321cf32"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19910007737, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19910007737, "id": "fef3d6f518964cf998c49413f1f658ac", "publicationName": "Space Transportation Avionics Technology Symposium.
