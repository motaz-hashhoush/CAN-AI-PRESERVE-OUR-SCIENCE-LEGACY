Experiment-related operations consist of the integration of various experiment elements into the flight module. After Spacelab-Space Shuttle interfaces have been verified, the Spacelab cargo is transferred to the Orbiter Processing Facility in a controlled environment. Attention is given to the integrity of all payload-to-Space Shuttle interfaces during final closeout operations. Payload-related activities are minimal at the launch pad stage, since only limited access to the payload module is available through the Space lab Transfer Tunnel.", "title": "Spacelab ground processing", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PROCEEDINGS", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-11T15:06:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19830032489, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Scully, E.
