The Equivalent Low Stretch Apparatus (ELSA) uses an inverted cone heater to minimize buoyant effects while at the same time providing a forced stagnation flow on the sample, which ignites and burns as a ceiling fire. Ignition delay and burning rate data is correlated with incident heat flux and convective heat transfer and compared to results from other test methods and fuel geometries using similarity to determine the equivalent stretch rates and thus convective cooling (or heating) rates for those geometries. With this correlation methodology, buoyant effects inherent in normal gravity material flammability test methods can be estimated, to better apply the test results to low stretch environments relevant to spacecraft material selection.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20120015092, "endDate": "2011-06-24T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "10th International Solid-State Sensors, Actuators and Microsystems Conference", "location": "College Park, MD", "id": "f75497fbe2cd4012bc2425a12f05fbba", "startDate": "2011-06-19T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20120015092, "id": "55215d934529406da5df905cfc143476", "publicationDate": "2011-06-19T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20120015092.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20120015092/downloads/20120015092.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20120015092/downloads/20120015092.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20120015092/downloads/20120015092.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
