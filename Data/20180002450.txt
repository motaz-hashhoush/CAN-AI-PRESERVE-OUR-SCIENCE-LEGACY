The\ndata show nearly uniform isotopic composition similar\nto that of typical ureilites with negative \xce\xb554Cr values\n[17,18].\nAnalytical Methods: The aliquot for Cr isotopic\nanalysis was prepared from small chips of material\nfrom Almahata Sitta 91A (24.77 mg) and 671 (10.84\nmg). Chromium was separated from the sample matrix\nusing a three-column chromatography procedure [19].\nThe Cr isotopic composition was measured using a\nThermo Triton Plus thermal ionization mass spectrometer at the University of California, Davis.\n2.00\nNovato (dark lith.)\n\n1.00\n0.00\n\nD17O (\xe2\x80\xb0)\n\nIntroduction: There is an increasing number of\nCr-O-Ti isotope studies [1-6] that show that solar system materials are divided into two main populations,\none carbonaceous chondrite (CC)-like and the other is\nnon-carbonaceous (NCC)-like, with minimal mixing\nbetween them attributed to a gap opened in the\npropoplanetary disk due to Jupiter\xe2\x80\x99s formation\n[5,6,7,8]. The Grand Tack model [9] suggests that\nthere should be a particular time in the disk history\nwhen this gap is breached and ensuring a subsequent\nlarge-scale mixing between S- and C-type asteroids\n(inner solar system and outer solar system materials),\nan idea supported by our recent work on chondrule\n\xce\x9417O-\xce\xb554Cr isotope systematics [10].\nThe Almahata Sitta (AhS) meteorite provides a\nunique opportunity to test the Grand Tack model. The\nmeteorite fell to Earth in October 2008 from the impact\nof asteroid 2008 TC3 which was discovered just prior\nto the fall of the AhS stones [11-13]. The AhS meteorite is composed of up to 700 individual pieces with\n~190 of those pieces having some geochemical and/or\npetrologic studies [14,23]. Almahata Sitta is an anomalous polymict ureilite with other meteorite components, including enstatite, ordinary, and carbonaceous\nchondrites with an approximate abundance of 70-80%\nureilites and 20-30% chondrites [14,15]. This observation has lead to the suggestion that TC3 2008 was a\nloosely aggregated rubble pile-like asteroid with the\nnon-ureilite sample clasts within the rubble-pile (e.g.,\n[14,15] and references therein). Due to the looselyaggregated nature of AhS, the object disintegrated during atmospheric entry resulting in the weakly held\nclasts falling predominantly as individual stones in the\nAhS collection area. These stones are regarded as\nclasts from a highly heterogeneous breccia that probably represents ureilitic regolith [15]. Recent work\n[16,23] has identified one sample of AhS, sample 91A,\nwhich shows both ureilitic and chondritic lithologies\nco-existing within a single stone. The predominate\nlithology type in 91A is a C1 chondrite based on mineralogy, but the C1 material contains clasts of olivine,\npyroxene, and plagioclase that have ureilite-like compositions, as well as chondrules derived from OC and\nprimitive CC, and metal blebs from OC and EC\n[26,23]. It has been suggested that similar material\ncomprised the bulk of asteroid 2008 TC3 [16,23].

These are the highest \xce\xb554Cr values observed thus far in any CC-like reservoir. In fact, it is the highest \xce\xb554Cr in any bulk planetary materials in hand. This \xce\xb554Cr is clearly resolved\nfrom ureilites that have negative \xce\xb554Cr ~ -0.90 [18] as\nthe extreme end member of the NC reservoir in terms\nof \xce\xb554Cr value. The difference indicates that the AhS\n91A and 671 fragments originated from a Cr isotopic\n\nreservoir distinct from that from which ureilites\nformed. The \xce\xb554Cr of AhS 91A is higher than CI, CM,\nand CR chondrites and has a \xce\xb554Cr composition higher\nthan any observed in any carbonaceous materials ([4,6]\nand references therein). This would indicate that the\nmaterial that comprises AhS 91A and 671 is not typical\nCI-like material and instead is a carbonaceous chondrite material that we have yet to sample in our collections as a separate meteorite.\nTypical polymict ureilites commonly contains\nclasts of dark materials identified as CC-like [24-27].\nSince at least one of these [27] has been found to have\nan oxygen isotope composition almost identical to that\nof 91A, it is possible that typical polymict ureilites\ncontain more samples of new lithologies like 91A/671.\nThe observation of a different \xce\xb554Cr in AhS 91A\nand 671 compared to ureilites or the other AhS samples [17] has important implications for large scale\nnebular wide mixing between NCC and CC-like reservoirs, as suggested by the Grand Tack model [9]. This\nis supported by a rubble-pile like nature of the AhS\nasteroid. Details of our model will be presented at the\ntime of conference.\nReferences: [1] Yin Q.-Z. et al. (2009) LPS XL,\nA2006.
