The framework is designed to enable advanced R&D on a variety of topics by leveraging a mature capability for scale resolving simulations, and simultaneously be an appropriate tool for application analysis and support. Currently, eddy is at a relatively low technical readiness level (TRL), and users and developers should maintain appropriate expectations. The technical details behind eddy are outlined in several publications which can be consulted for more information [1\u201310]. The solvers are built around an unstructured high-order capability, and heavily utilize the tensor product sum-factorization approach for efficiency. The unsteady formulation utilizes a fully implicit space-time approach with a matrix-free Newton- Krylov method. A primitive steady-state solver is available for testing purposes, but is not expected to converge for all but simple verification cases. The Navier-Stokes fluid solvers do not support either RANS or hybrid-RANS capability, only LES and wall-modeled LES approaches. All of the solvers within eddy support three modes of operation: a primal solve of the full nonlinear problem, and two linearization approaches of the primal solve - the ad joint and the tangent solution. Details on how to select and use these three modes are outlined in Sec. 3.
