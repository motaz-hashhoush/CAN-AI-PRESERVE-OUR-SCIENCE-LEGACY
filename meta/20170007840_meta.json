The RMS error of individual GPS water level estimates is about 12 cm. Lower water levels are measured slightly more accurately than higher water levels. Forming daily mean sea levels reduces the RMS difference with the tide gauge data to approximately 2 cm. For monthly means, the RMS difference is 1.3 cm. The GPS elevations, of course, can be automatically placed into a well-defined terrestrial reference frame. Ocean tide coefficients, determined from both the GPS and tide gauge data, are in good agreement, with absolute differences below 1 cm for all constituents save K1 and S1. The latter constituent is especially anomalous, probably owing to daily temperature-induced errors in the Aquatrak tide gauge", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "publications": [{"volume": "34", "submissionId": 20170007840, "issue": "2", "issn": "0739-0572", "publisher": "American Meteorological Society", "eissn": "1520-0426", "id": "da23f1d22aa345beb7daeb1cb4ff0e51", "publicationName": "Journal of Atmospheric and Oceanic Technology", "publicationDate": "2017-01-24T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
