b'N93-18884\n\nAsteroid Mining\nRichard\n\nf--to\n\nE. Gertsch\n\nThe earliest studies\n\nof asteroid\n\nmining (e.g., Johnson and Holbrow\n1977) proposed retrieving a main\nbelt asteroid.\nBecause of the very\nlong travel times to the main\nasteroid belt, attention has shifted\n(Billingham,\nGilbreath, and O\'Leary\n1979, O\'Leary 1983) to the\nasteroids whose orbits bring them\nfairly close to the Earth. In these\nschemes, the asteroid would be\n\npostulated\nnear-Earth\nbodies rich\nin volatiles (water, halogens, and\norganics)\nand metals (structural,\nprecious, and strategic).\nWhile no\nasteroid prospect has yet been\nidentified, the possibility of\nobtaining such materials for\ncislunar operations\nfrom a source\nrequiring low AV is exciting\nshould be pursued.\n\nand\n\nbagged and then processed\nduring\nthe return trip, with the asteroid\nitself providing the reaction mass to\n\nFurthermore,\nsamples in the form\nof carbonaceous chondrites\nand\nsimilar classes of meteorites\n\npropel the mission homeward.\nA\nmission to one of these near-Earth\n\nindicate that their parent asteroids\nmay have favorable\nmechanical\nproperties.\nSome of these\nmaterials break up easily at\npressures as low as a few bars\n(105 N/m2) (see table 17 in- John\nLewis\'s paper).\nThis breakup\npressure is much less than that for\nmost terrestrial materials.\nFor\n\nasteroids\n\nwould\n\nbe shorter,\n\ninvolve less weight, and require a\nsomewhat lower change in velocity\n(AV). Since these asteroids\napparently contain a wide range of\npotentially useful materials, our\nstudy group considered\nonly them.\n\nAsteroid Materials\nProperties\n\nand\n\nThe forces driving the consideration\nof asteroid mining are their varied\nmaterials and favorable retrieval AV\n(see John S. Lewis\'s\nvolume).\nCombining\n\npaper in this\ninformation\n\nfrom spectral studies of asteroids\nand laboratory analyses of\nmeteorites,\ninvestigators\nhave\n\nexample, some material can be\ncrushed by hand. Although other\nasteroids may be fundamentally\ntougher, impacts may have broken\nup their surfaces into regolith (soil).\nThus our study group came to\nbelieve that material from a nearEarth asteroid should be easily\nexcavated\nand rather easily\ncrushed by mechanical\ncomminution\nequipment\ndeveloped\nfor terrestrial\napplications.\n\nalready\n\n111\n\nAsteroid\n\nMining\n\nAsteroids have resource potential,\nnotably the potential for prowding water,\nwhich can be decomposed\ninto\nhydrogen and oxygen for propellant\nuse. Asteroids may have rough\ncratered surfaces, as illustrated in this\npainting.\nIf they are water-rich, they, are\nlikely to be similar to carbonaceous\nchondritic meteorites, which are very\nblack, with extremely low albedos.\nSuch asteroids may be rather soft and\nfriable and thus easily mined.\nArtist.\n\n112\n\nDennis Daviclson\n\nAsteroid\n\nMission\n\nSelection\n\nWhile the latest studies of retrieval\nand processing methods indicate\nthat the project is feasible, the\nselection and the execution of an\nasteroid return mission are still\nfraught with problems. These\nproblems stem from two basic\ncauses: no candidate asteroid has\nbeen identified and the long trip\ntime imposes severe limits on the\nmission. The results seem\nattainable but only with much more\nwork.\nIdentifying an Asteroid Prospect\nFrom the perspective of the\nterrestrial mining industry, lack\nof a specific asteroid candidate\nor prospect means that no\nproject exists. Mining projects\nare so sensitive to actual site\ncharacteristics that an asteroid\nmining mission cannot be justified\non circumstantial evidence. This is\nparticularly true of an unmanned\nmission, where everything must\nwork properly the first time and\nwithout human intervention.\nConfidence that a feasible asteroid\nprospect exists in the near-Earth\nenvironment is based on statistical\nanalysis. Given the known\ndistribution of near-Earth asteroids\nand studies of their compositions,\nit seems probable that a candidate\n\ncan be located, if enough\nresources are applied to the\nsearch effort (see Michael J.\nGaffey\'s paper in this volume).\nPhysical properties of prospective\ncandidates--mineral grades,\nmineral variability, specific\nmechanical characteristics of the\nasteroidal material, and orbital\ncharacteristics--must be\ndetermined before significant\ndevelopment of an asteroid\nmission proceeds.\nNevertheless, a basic\nunderstanding of what an asteroid\nmission might entail is readily at\nhand. Using the possible orbits,\nmineral compositions, and\nmechanical properties of the nearEarth asteroids, one can construct\na range of potential missions.\nThe feasibility of such a mission\ncan be established and comparison\ncan be made to a lunar mission,\nsuch as the LOX-to-LEO project.\nSensitivity analysis of asteroid\nmission profiles and comparisons\nto lunar projects can begin almost\nimmediately. Criteria can be\ndeveloped that will guide selection\nof candidate asteroid bodies.\nThe expected range of flight\ncharacteristics, combinations of\nore grades, ore types, mechanical\nproperties, flight durations, and\ntransportation costs can be\ndetermined and the range\ncompared to that of a lunar project.\n\n113\n\nLong\n\nMission\n\nautomatic/teleoperated\nhas yet to be answered.\n\nDuration\n\nLong travel times to near-Earth\nasteroids pose significant\neconomic\nand operational\nproblems.\nPhysical\nsampling of the candidate\nbody\nwould take as long as the mining\nmission, so the flow of riskreducing information\nis slow.\nsampling mission would take\nor more, there may be a long\nfor the next mission window,\n\nThe\na year\nwait\nand\n\nthen the mining mission would take\nanother year or more. Thus, the\nlead time could be very long.\nWhen the mining mission finally\nflies, an expensive\nmining plant\nwould have been in orbit a year\nor more before use. This\nunproductive\ntime significantly\nraises the mission\'s\ncost. The\nround-trip time of 2 years or more\nlowers the rate of return on\ninvestment\n\nin plant and equipment.\n\nMission feasibility\ndepends on the\nright choice of three basic types of\nmissions:\na long-duration\nmanned\nmission, an automatic\nor teleoperated\nmission, or a mission in which the\nmanned portion accepts high AV\nand the equipment\narrives by\nslow Hohmann transfer orbit.\nDetermining\nthe proper choice\nwill require extensive\nresearch\nand development,\nwhich, of\ncourse, increases\nmission cost.\nEach type has its advantages\nand disadvantages,\nboth\nduring the mission and in later\ntechnology\ntransfer.\nThe basic\ntradeoff question-manned\nor\n\n114\n\nManned Versus\nMissions\nManned\n\nAutomated\n\nMissions\n\nWhile the problems and expense\nof a manned mission are obvious-long-term\n\nexposure\n\nto zero gravity,\n\nexposure to dangerous\nsolar\nradiation, designing controlled\necological\nlife support systems,\nand man-rating\na deep space\nvehicle (just for starters)--our\nstudy group, with its terrestrial\nmining perspective,\nsuspects that\nan asteroid mining mission will\nrequire human miners.\nThe reason\nis our skepticism\nabout the ability\nto economically\nautomate such\na mission.\nNot only has progress\nin terrestrial\nmine automation\nbeen slow, but also the prospect\nof applying such technology\nto\nan environment\nwith so many\nunknowns\nis daunting.\nAutomated\n\nMissions\n\nThe benefits of automation\nderived from economic\n\nare\n\nconsiderations\nand not simply\nfrom eliminating\npeople from the\nproduction\nloop. If automation\ndecreases\nproduction\ncosts, it\nshould be used. This principle is\nimportant even in highly automated\nindustries such as automobile\nmanufacturing.\n\nTasks\n\nthat are\n\nrepetitive and boring yet require\nprecision are the best candidates\nfor automation.\nIn this realm, the\nexperience of General Motors\nilluminates the point. GM\'s new,\nlargely automated assembly\nplant\nhas yet to reach production\ngoals\nand has a myriad of problems.\nIncreasing the production\nrate and\nmaintaining\nthe required quality\nwhile lowering or maintaining\nproduction costs justifies the\nincreased capital cost of\nautomation.\nSome mines, particularly\nIongwall\ncoal mines, have successfully\nachieved partial automation\nof a\nrelatively repetitive mining system.\nIt was accomplished\nin small steps:\nOne easily defined machine\noperation or task was automated\nwhile the rest of the operations\nremained manual.\nAfter debugging\nand redesign, the automated\noperation achieved the required\ndegree of reliability.\nThen, another\ncandidate for automation\nwas\nselected and the process was\nrepeated.\nOver several years,\n\n2\n\na\n\nreliable and integrated\nbut not fully\nautomated system may thus be\npainstakingly\nbuilt. In general,\nterrestrial mine automation\nhas\nbeen confined to remote sensing\nof mine parameters,\nsuch as\nventilation and equipment\nstatus,\nand production\nmonitoring.\n\nComplete mine automation\nhas\nbeen shown to have too great\na capital cost to be effectively\namortized over the production\nlife of a mine.\nFurthermore,\nmining operations\nhave a much\ngreater number of degrees of\nfreedom than does automobile\nmanufacturing.\nBesides increasing\ncapital (and R&D) costs, operations\nthat are not exactly repetitive have\nmore automation\nproblems than\ndo repetitive operations.\nThus,\nmining costs are not lowered by\nautomation as much as product\nmanufacturing\ncosts are. The fact\nthat the harsh mining environment\nis much harder on equipment\nthan\nis a closed plant environment\nonly\naggravates the problem.\nThis experience\n\ndoes not close\n\nthe door on automatic/teleoperated\nasteroid missions.\nIt does indicate\ncaution when contemplating\nthese missions.\nThe automatic/\nteleoperated\nasteroid mining\nequipment must work perfectly.\nEven small equipment\nfailures\ncause the mission to fail. An\nexpensive R&D effort is needed\nto ensure such perfection.\nAs with\nthe lunar case, the lessons learned\nin flying an automatic/teleoperated\nasteroid mission may find extensive\nterrestrial application,\nhelping to\namortize the large R&D costs.\n\n115\n\nA MannedAlternative\nOne possible compromise\nin the\nmanned/automated\ntradeoff is to\nsend the equipment\n\non a low AV\n\nflight and launch the human\noperators\nseparately\non a much\nshorter, high AV flight. The\nastronauts\nwould mine the body,\nstart the materials on a sJow trip\nback to cislunar space, and\nthemselves\nmake a fast trip back.\nIt should be noted that any manned\nmission would have the possibility\nof refining some or all of the fuel\nrequired for the return trip.\nTeleoperated\n\nMissions\n\nTeleoperation\nresolves some of the\ndifficulties\nof automated\noperation.\nA greater range of the unforeseen\nproblems the system will encounter\nbecome solvable.\nHowever,\nactions are carried out by the\nsame actuation devices in both\nautomation\nand teleoperation.\nThis\nfact imposes limitations\nin mining\noperation control.\nThe Viking\nlander case is illuminating.\nThe\nViking mission, which cost about\n$1 billion (in 1970 dollars, about\n$3 billion now), included an\nextendable\nscoop experiment\nthat\nwas teleoperated.\nAlthough the\nscoop was relatively simple in\ndesign and operation,\nwith few\ndegrees of freedom, first attempts\nto actuate it failed. A good deal of\nevaluation\nand effort ensued before\nthe scoop\noperated.\n\n116\n\nwas successfully\n\nTeleoperation\n\nfrom\n\nEarth would\n\nbe\n\nsomewhat\nhampered by a control\ndelay due to the long distances\nand\nthe speed of signal propagation.\nHowever,\nit seems likely that the\neffect could be overcome.\n\nMining\n\nin Zero Gravity\n\nAlthough it might seem easier to\nmove materials in zero gravity than\non Earth, inertia, not overcoming\ngravity, is the major effect to\nconsider.\nLittle experience has\nbeen gained in weightlessness.\nOne sample problem is that of\nholding fracturing\nand excavation\ntools to the face of an asteroid,\nOn Earth, equipment hold-down\naccomplished solely by gravity.\nAnother sample problem is\n\nis\n\ncontaining the excavated material,\neither large or small fragments.\nRock fracturing\nplaces an initial\nvelocity on the broken material.\nOn Earth, gravity quickly\ncollects the broken rock. In\nweightlessness,\nthe broken rock\nwill behave like out-of-control\nbilliard balls, a potentially\ndestructive game.\nFurthermore,\nthe fines that are always generated\nby rock fracturing\nmay obscure\nvision and clog equipment.\nOur\nstudy group did not have time to\nconsider the full significance\nworking complex equipment\n\nof\nin\n\nzero g, but we note that this\nproblem needs in-depth study.\n\nz\n\nA Conceptual\nAsteroid\nMining\nMethod\nThe study group did not have the\ntime or the resources to fully\ndesign a baseline asteroid mining\nmethod. This incomplete concept\nof an asteroid mining method is\nintended to illustrate how some of\nthe problems could be overcome.\nAs with the lunar proposal, the\nconcept should be used to\npromote discussion of asteroid\nmining problems, but not to\npromote the method itself.\nAssuming that the _V for the\navailable asteroid is small and that\nonly a modest amount of material\nis needed, I propose the following\nmethod to accomplish a first\nmission.\nAfter arriving at the asteroid, the\noperators place one or more\ncables around the body. The\nasteroid proposed to the group for\nstudy was no more than a few\nhundred meters in diameter.\nPlacing a cable around the body\nappeared to us much easier than\nanchoring the end of a shorter\ncable. Anchoring in rock can be a\ndifficult process. If augering is\nused in weightlessness, a method\nmust be devised to hold the\naugering tool down while it is\nworking. The most desirable\nasteroids have very low strengths,\ngood for mining but poor for\nanchoring. Quite long cables\nare possible, on the order of\n\n1000 meters. The cable is easily\nplaced and provides easy\nmovement of the mining tool.\nOne disadvantage of a long cable\nis the mass; for example, a cable\n1 inch in diameter weighs\n1.6 pounds per foot on Earth (has\na mass of 2.4 kg/m).\nThe cable holds a cutter head or\nother rock-fracturing tool in place\nand provides sufficient working\nforce for it. The cutter head is\ndesigned to excavate in addition to\nfracturing the soft rock. A conical\nKevlar collection bag is placed\nover the area to be mined and is\nheld in place by the same cable\n(fig. 24). The flexible bag holds its\nshape because of the rotation of\nthe asteroid. The spin also aids in\ncollecting the fragmented asteroid\nmaterial.\nThe cutter head travels back and\nforth along its restraining cable,\ncutting material until the collection\nbag is filled (fig. 25). The cutter is\nsimilar to the coal shear currently\nused in Iongwall operations but is\ndesigned to overcome the\nasteroid\'s low gravity and fling\nmaterial past synchronous orbit so\nthat centripetal force effects\ncollectionl Dust production\naround the cutter head remains a\nproblem. Dusty environments\nobscure vision and thus increase\nproblems in controlling\nteleoperated systems or in\nmonitoring automated systems.\n\n117\n\nHowever,\ndirectvisionmaynotbe\nso important bodythatproves\nona\nto be homogeneous structure\nin\nandcomposition.\nAfter the required amount of\nmaterial is collected in the bag, it\nis "lowered" away from the body,\nallowing the bag and material to\nsteal angular momentum from the\nasteroid. For low AV return flights,\n\nthere may be sufficient energy\navailable to slingshot the load back\nto Earth. Deceleration at Earth\ncould be accomplished by\naerobraking. Thecoilection bag\nmight be designed to act as an\naerobrake shield in addition to\nbeing reusable. The bag could also\nserve as a retort for carbonyl or\nother types of processing during\nreturn.\n\nFigure 24\n\nConcept\n\nfor an Asteroid\n\nThe shear breaks material\n\nMiner\nand throws it\n\naway from the asteroid into the collection\nbag. The bag is moved when the shear\nmoves to a new mining area. The\ncollection bag can be used to transport\nthe material to the Earth. The bag could\nalso be used as an aerobrake shield or a\nprocessing\n\ni\n\ncontainer.\n\nFigure 25\n\nDetail\n\nof the Shear\n\nThe shear is derived\n\nfrom coal-cutting\n\ntechnology.\nIt performs a dual role: it\ncuts the asteroid material and throws the\nmaterial into the collection bag. In this\nillustration, the wheels are too small;\nlarger, high-flotation\nwheels will help\nnegotiate rough terrain.\nThere should\nalso be chutes to direct material past\nsynchronous orbit and into the bag. And\nthe shears conflict with the wheel path;\nthey should be either inside or outside the\nwheels.\n\n118\n\n!\n\nAn alternative, but basically similar,\nmethod still uses the bag and\ncable. However, a large block of\nasteroid material is collected, not\nby mechanical excavation but by\nblasting material into the bag.\nInstead of a shear, which could\nhave trouble negotiating the\nasteroid surface, an explosive is\nused. The cable holds in place a\ndrilling machine, which drills a\nseries of blast holes. The drill\nholes and charges are carefully\ndesigned to excavate a large\nsection of the asteroid. The\nexplosive charges break out the\ndesired amount of material, and\nthe force of the explosion moves\nthe material into the collection bag.\nPattern drilling designed to create\nshaped explosions has achieved\nsome success on the Earth and is\nfinding more applications. The\nexplosive method appears simpler\nin equipment and operation than\nthe shear, but the blasting must\nhave a very high degree of control.\nUncontrolled fragmentation of the\ncabled body would be a disaster.\nI have not considered a suitable\nblasting agent. The reader can\nvisualize this alternative method by\nimagining a drill rig instead of the\nshear in figures 24 and 25.\nWhile the sizing of the return loads\nrequires further study, the same\nbasic mining scheme should be\nable to handle a range of sizes. It\nis not completely clear whether one\nlarge load or several smaller loads\nwould be better, although several\n\nsmaller loads might be more\nmanageable, while allowing more\nflexible return flight plans.\n\nConclusions\nBecause it appears to be easier\nand cheaper to accomplish, the\nlunar mine is probably a better first\nproject to exploit nonterrestrial\nmaterials than is the asteroid mine.\nWhile not causing any increased\ntransportation costs, the long, slow\ntravel to and from the near-Earth\nasteroids would decrease the rate\nof return on capital investment.\nAs in the lunar LOX-to-LEO project,\nthe asteroid mining system must\nbe kept as simple as possible.\nSimplicity eases problems and\nlowers the costs of development,\nequipment, and operations.\nA manned mission would make\nthe mining operation much simpler,\nbut it would greatly increase the\ncomplexity and cost of the deep\nspace transport vehicle.\nTeleoperation seems a good\ncompromise between automation\nand manned missions, but the\nchoice requires much more study.\nEven if specific space program\ngoals or higher costs eventually\npreclude an asteroid mission, the\nrich and varied asteroid materials\nrequire that the option of mining\n\n119\n\nanasteroid\nbestudied.Givena\ngoalofproviding rangeof\na\nmaterialsor usein cislunar\nf\nspace,lunarprojects\nmustbe\ndemonstrated besuperior efore\nto\nb\nasteroid\nmissions\nareabandoned.\nReferences\nBillingham, John; William (3ilbreath;\nand Brian O\'Leary, eds. 1979.\nSpace Resources and Space\nSettlements.
