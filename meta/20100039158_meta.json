California Institute of Technology (CalTech), the organization that runs JPL, is the leading institute in patents for all U.S. universities. There are several mechanisms that are available to JPL to inform industry of these technological advances: (1) a dedicated organization at JPL, National Space Technology Applications (NSTA), (2) Tech Brief Magazine, (3) Spinoff magazine, and (4) JPL publications. There have also been many start-up organizations and businesses from CalTech.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20100039158, "name": "JPL''s 8th Briefing for Industry", "location": "Pasadena, CA", "id": "acbd6eb43411433e94121d5948c1a42a", "startDate": "2006-04-18T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20100039158, "id": "26207a65d78d43a48c05a3c243109f77", "publicationDate": "2006-04-18T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
