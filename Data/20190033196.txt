This entails not only understanding the impact the space environment\nwill have on humans, but also how it will affect other organisms needed for humans to survive in\nspace such as plants. In addition, it has been reported in the literature that hundreds of genes\nseem to be conserved and/or transferred between different organisms from bacteria, archaea,\nfungi, microorganisms, and plants to animals. Since space travel involves humans in a closed\nenvironment over a long period of time, we hypothesize that potential conserved biological factors\nwill occur between the different organisms in that environment possibly due to transfer of genes.\nDetermining the conserved factors that are commonly being regulated in space can shed insight\ninto possible universal master regulators and also determine the symbiotic relationship between\nthe organisms in space. Utilizing NASA\xe2\x80\x99s GeneLab Data Repository (a rapidly expanding, curated\nclustering of spaceflight-related \xe2\x80\x98omics-level datasets for all organisms), we were able to uncover\na novel pathway and factors that were commonly shared between humans, mice, plants, C.\nElegans, and drosophilas. Through ChIP-Seq enrichment analysis techniques utilizing various\nGeneLab datasets from each species that were flown in space, we found the following factors to\nbe conserved across all species: oxidative stress, DNA damage (through GABPA/NRFs and\nNFY), SIX5, GTF2B and glutamine synthetase. Such commonalities would likely reflect the effects\nof factors such as microgravity and the increased radiation exposure inherent in spaceflight on\nbasic physical processes shared by all biological systems at the cellular level. Differences\nbetween organismal responses revealed by GeneLab\xe2\x80\x99s data should also help understand the\nunique reactions to life in space that arise from the very different lifestyles of microbes, animals\nand plants.\n\nGeneLab Cross Species\n,\nRichard Barker\nNeil McKenna,\nEric Weitz,\nJoshua Vandenbrink ,\nWillian da Silveira ,\nReinsch, Sigrid S,\nBeheshti, Afshin,\nSylvain
