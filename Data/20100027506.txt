NASA\'s patent-licensing program to\nencourage commercial development is described on page A6 .\n\nWindow Comparator for\nVoltages\n.Y",\n\nA very simple circuit determines\nwhether an input voltage is within a\npreselected range . The ci rcuit requires few components and is relatively immune to errors from referencevoltage drift. It could be useful in\nprocess-control circuitry, measuring\ninstruments, and checkout equipment.\nThe circuit uses two op amps and two\nswitching diodes. One op amp subtracts the input signal from a set-point\nvoltage . The other subtracts the\ndifference output of the first op amp\nfrom the preselected window-width\nvoltage . Unlike window comparators\nthat consist of two simple level\ncomparators , the stability requirements on the reference voltage are not\ngreat.\n(See page 464 .)\n\nhigh-pressure instrument valves it\nrequires less-precise machining and\nuses less power . It is essentially a\nsmall geared reversible motor operated by a momentary contact closure .\nThe motor rotates a shaft and also\nmoves it linearly, causing ports to be\nconnected and disconnected . The\ncontrol circuit consists of limit switches and relays.\n(See page 547 .)\n\nfree of interfering contaminants\nbecause components are vacuumbaked before assembly to reduce\noutgassing, and passive "getters" are\nincluded within the package .\n(See page 495 .)\n\nImproved Table-Saw Guard\n\nSealed High-Pressure\nX-Ray Detector\n\nA transparent plastic safety guard\nfor table saws is counterbalanced to\nreduce damage to fragile materials\n(e .g., foams) . The counterbalance\ncauses less force to be applied to the\nworkpiece as it is pushed under the\nguard . The overhead support makes is\npossible to perform slot and step cuts\nwith the guard in place . This is not\nusually possible with a conventional\nguard that is supported by struts\nthrough the saw slot.\n(See page 549.)\n\nMiniature Motor-Driven\nInstrument Valve\n\nLow-EMI Solid-State Relay\nA remotely controlled valve can\nconnect pressure transducers to calibration pressure sources . The valve\ncan withstand up to 600 psi . It was\ndeveloped for use in wind tunnels and\nengine test stands , but could be used\nin any application requiring pilot valves\nfor control devices. Compared to other\n\nA10\n\nA new imaging hard X-ray detector\noperates for a long period of time with\na single gas filling . Conventionally, a\ncontinuous gas flow has been requred\nto sweep out contaminants . This\nsealed detector has potential applications in nuclear medicine for use with\nradioactive tracers and could also be\nuseful in X- and gamma-ray astronomy . The sealed detector can remain\n\nA proposed solid-state relay could\nreduce the electromagnetic interference (EMI) generated when ac power\nis switched to a load. It could be used\nwherever the elimination of electrical\nnoise is a concern . The input is\noptically coupled to the circuit. The\ninput signal turns on a trigger circuit\nthat fires a gate-controlled semiconductor switch , which switches current\nNASA Tech Brtefs, Winter 1979\n\nA precise tool can be used with a\ntoolmaker\'s microscope to enscribe\nfine lines on flat or round surfaces . It\nwas orig inally used to draw very\naccurate gage marks for a materialstesting program . This simply constructed tool can be screwed or\nclamped onto the lens column without\naltering the microscope . The scribe\npoint is alined with the vertical\ncrosshair of the eyepiece , and a line is\ndrawn by moving the microscope slide\ntable. The depth and width of the\nscribed line can be adjusted . When\nnot needed , the scriber can be swung\nout of the way , allowing the microscope to be used for other purposes .\n(See page 563 .)\n\nto the load . In this way the load is\nturned on at zero voltage , and the\nsem iconductor switch turns off at\nnearly zero current.\n(See page 465 .)\n\nTool for Installation and\nRemoval of Cylindrical\nBaffles\nmuscle simultaneously. The transducer, which has been tested on dogs ,\nhas a specially-designed tine system .\nTwo tines , indented for retention by\nthe muscle , have a lower compliance\nthan the muscle fiber . This causes the\nfiber to apply stresses to the point\nwhere the tines are joined, where a\npiezoelectric transducer is placed . In\naddition , a high-compliance elliptical\nloop is attached to one tine . Changes\nin the thickness of the muscle\ncompress the loop; compression is\nmeasured by a piezoelectric transducer. A third , high-compliance , tine\ndetects linear displacement of the\nmuscle fiber between the other two\ntines .\n(See page 517 .)\n\nPrecision Scriber\n\nA simple tool , similar to an automobile oil wrench , can be used to install\nand remove cylindrical baffles . The\ntool is essentially a curled metal sheet\nbrazed onto a handgrip . The handgrip\ncan be driven by wrench or other\nconvenient tool. The curled metal\nsheet is slipped over a thread-on baffle\nand is twisted to advance the baffle . A\nseparate mirror-image tool is used to\nremove a baffle .\n(See page 551 .)\n\nTrifunctional Transducer for\nMyocardial Monitoring\nThe prototype of a new myocardial\ntransducer measures force , displacement, and thickness of the heart\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1979\n\nStructurally-Continuous\nComposite Corners\n\nA simple technique for making\nboxes of plies of composite materials\neliminates the overlapping edges that\nmake the corners thicker than the\nwalls for conventionally made containers . A proposed folding pattern produces uniform corners , and the cuts\nare structured so that shear loads are\ntransferred from ply to ply instead of\nacross one surface . This technique\nhas been proposed for an aircraft\naileron rib made from composite plies\nalternately\noriented\nplus\nand\nminus 45\xc2\xb0 .\n(See page 578.)\n\nPlasma-Sprayed\nValve Coating\nA fused cobalt and tungsten carbide\ncoating can reduce wear and improve\nthe performance and life of valves ,\npoppets , and other intricately shaped\ncomponents . Developed to protect\nnickel alloy parts in the main engine of\nNASA\'s Space Shuttle , the coating\ncould be useful in the manufacture of\n(continued on next page)\nA11\n\nmotors, automotive parts, and highspeed machinery . The dense and\nwear-resistant coating can be applied\nin controlled thicknesses . Coated\nparts resist spalling , flaking , thermal\nshock , and mechanical shock .

Since the\ndevice is not actually inserted into the\nairspace, no air is lost during the\nmeasurement, and continuous monitoring of pressure is possible . The\npressure-sensing device consists of\ntwo pads that contact the inner and\nouter tire walls. One pad is connected\nto a pressure gage, and the load on\nthat pad is increased until the tire\ndeflects . At that point, the externally\napplied pressure is approximately\nequal to the internal tire pressure.\n(See page 524.)\n\nSensor/Amplifier for Weak\nLight Sources\nA cable-deployment projectile can\nwithstand accelerations up to 20 ,000\ng\'s and can operate at a velocity up to\n500 ft/s . It was developed as a\ncommunications link for an instrument\nprobe to be fired 40 ft into the surface\nof Mars . The forebody is a ballistic\ncasing with a plastic drag funnel\nmounted over the rear opening . The\ncable is coiled within , in a single layer\non a cylindrical spool . The cable is a\ntensile-strong beryllium and copper\nalloy with good elongation and low\n\nA12\n\n" noisy" environment to detect very\nweak light signals ; yet they are\nrelatively simple and use readily\navailable components . The sensor\nitself is a pyroelectric crystal that\ndevelops an electric charge from the\nheat of incident light (as little as\n3x1 0- 10 watt per square centimeter) .\nThe amplification circuit converts\nsensor outputs as low as 0.1 microvolt\nto millivolts. The circuit has worked\nwithout electric shielding in a room\nwith fluorescent lights, which would\ngenerate considerable electrical interference for most sensitive amplifiers .\n(See page 467.)\n\nA sensitive light-detecting amplifier\ncircuit developed for astronomical\ninstruments could be useful in fire\ndetectors , photographic processing ,\nand many other applications . The\nsensor and circuit can operate in a\n\nA new wind turbine may be 20\npercent more efficient than conventional propeller-driven units . By incorporating anti-"pinch-off" and windamplification features, the turbine\ndelivers energy at windspeeds of less\nthan 13 miles per hour. In periods of\nno wind, the turbine can be powered\nby heated air from solar collectors or\nby flue gas from chimneys. The wind\namplifier directs the airflow into a\nspiral before it reaches the turbine\nblades . This increases the wind\nvelocity and introduces air turbulence\nthat hugs the blades for a longer\ndistance before separating . The turbine exhausts into an expansion\nchamber that improves efficiency by\nreducing back pressure .\n(See page 489.)\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1979\n\nHardware,\nTechniques, and\nProcesses\n\n464\n\nWindow Comparator for Voltages\n\n465\n\nLow-EM I Solid-State Relay\nReal-Time Digital Integrator\n\n466\n\nBiased-Receiver Digital Interface\n\n467\n\nSensor/Amplifier for Weak Light Sources\n\n468\n\nOverload Protection for Switching Regulators\n\n469\n\nAzimuth Correlator Design for IC Chip\n\n470\n\nRise-Time Control in Saturated Amplifiers\n\n472\n\nLow-Cost , Lightweight RF Transfer Switch\n\n472\n\nA Reliable Solid-State RF Transfer Switch\n\n473\n\nSemiconductor Step-Stress Testing\n\n474\n\nJANTX1 N645-1 Diode\n\n474\n\nJANTX1 N649-1 Diode\n\n474\n\nJANTX1N746A Diode\n\n475\n\nJANTX1 N759A Voltage-Regulating Diode\n\n475\n\nJANTX1 N937B Zener Diode\n\n475\n\nJANTX1 N972B Zener Diode\n\n475\n\nJANTX1 N981 B Zener Diode\n\n475\n\nJANTX1 N1202A Switching Diode\n\n476\n\nJANTX1 N3893 Diode\n\n476\n\nJANTX1 N4570A Zener Diode\n\n476\n\nJANTX1 N5415 Diode\n\n476\n\nJANTX1 N5417 Diode\n\n476\n\nJANTX1 N5420 Diode\n\n476\n\nJANTX1 N5550 Switching Diode\n\n477\n\nJANTX1 N5552 Switching Diode\n\n477\n\nJANTX1 N5554 Switching Diode\n\n477\n\nJANTX1 N5614 Switching Diode\n\n477\n\nJANTX1 N5615 Switching Diode\n\n478\n\nJANTX1 N5618 Switching Diode\n\n478\n\n462\n\nVariable-Resolution Counter\n\n465\n\nBooks and Reports\n\n463\n\nJANTX1 N5619 Diode\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1979\n\nVariable-Resolution Counter\nMultivalue clock signals reduce\nnumber of counter stages.\n\nLangley Research Center, Hampton, Virginia\nSTATUS\n\n.----.\xe2\x80\xa2\n,,,...\n\nOUTPUT\n\n~~.\n\n~\n\n100 kHz\n\n"0 Y,\n\nF\nY2\n\nltll lr-lJJLll\n1I 1I\n\nr-\n\nCNT- O.\n\nY3\n\nUP\n\nOs 00 00 LOAD CV\n\nCHT.\n\n.. \xe2\x80\xa2 c\n\n~\n\nON\n\nA\n\n8\n\nC\n\nCNT- O.\nUP\n\nOs 00 00 lOAD\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n)\n\no\n\nCl\xc2\xa3AR\n\n"sa\n\nI I I I\n\nI I I I\n\n1I111f111111\nCV\n\nCHT- O.\n\nOs 00 00\n\nlOAD CY\n\nUP\n\n14LSt93\n\n14LS113\n\n1I27"LS138\n\nCOUNT\nCOHTROl\n\n~~\n\nINTEAVAl..QOUNTEA\n\n10 MHZ\n\nCNT\xc2\xb7\nON \xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2\n\nc\n\nCNT- O.\nUP\n\nONA8CO\n\na.EAR\n\nONT\xc2\xb7\nON\nA 8\n\nC\n\nD\n\n741.8183\nCLEAR\n\nVeo\n\n*\n\nI\n\n1\n\n~T. 0 ...

The circuit\nallows the measurement of time\nintervals beyond the capability of a\nsingle n-bit counter while maintaining\na reasonable resolution . Obtaining\nsimilar time measurements with conventional techniques would require\nextra counters , increasing the number\nof data bits and making data handling\nmore difficult.\nThe circuit provides a digital quantity that when multiplied by the clock\nresolution measures time intervals of 1\nmicrosecond to 655.35 milliseconds .\nThree input clock frequencies are\nused, providing timing resoultions\nshown in the table .\nA 16-bit binary counter with parallel\ndata load is used for the interval\ncounter, and a 2-bit binary counter is\nused as a clock status counter (see\nfigure) . The clock signals are switched\nby a 2-line to 4-line decoder and the\nappropriate random logic. With an\ninitial condition of all counter outputs\nequal to zero, the status counter sets\nthe 2-line to 4-line decoder output, YO,\nlow, activating the 10-MHz clock.\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1979\n\nClock Frequency\n\nTiming Resolution\n\nTime Interval\n\n10 MHz\n\n100 ns\n\n1 MHz\n\n1 /AS\n\n6 .5535 to 65 .535 ms\n\n10/AS\n\n65.535 to 655.35 ms\n\n100 kHz\n\n1 /As to 6 .5535 ms\n\nTiming Resolution of a variable-resolution counter Is shown for three Input clock\nfrequencies .

A\nnew circuit requires fewer components than previous window comparators and is less susceptible to errors\nfrom reference voltage drift.\nInstead of using two simple comparators in parallel - one for the\nupper voltage limit and the other for\nthe lower limit as in previous circuits\n- the new circuit requires only two\noperational amplifiers and two switching diodes . One op amp subtracts the\ninput signal from a set-point voltage .\nThe other op amp subtracts the differ;\nence output of the first op amp from\nthe preselected window-width voltage .\nThe new window comparator is\nuseful in process-control circuitry ,\nmeasuring instruments, and checkout\nequipment. For example, the window\ncomparator can check the feedback\nsignal of a servomechanism to determine whether the servo is set within a\ngiven tolerance .\nIn the new window comparator (see\nfigure) , the window level and the\nwindow widths are adjusted independently. The set-point voltage is adjusted\nso that the output of the first\noperational amplifier changes polarity\nwhen the algebraic difference between the input signal and the\nset-point voltage changes polarity.\nPositive or negative feedback occurs\nthrough steering diode D1 or D2 to\nmaintain the negative input terminal of\nop amp 1 at or near ground potential.\nThe circuit is self compensating for\ntemperature effects upon the forward\ndiode voltage drop .\nThe second op amp determines\nwhether the output of the first op amp\nhas changed polarity and exceeded\nthe window-width setting. When the\ninput is more positive than the set\npoint , q. negative output of op amp 1\ncontrols op amp 2 through steering\ndiode D2 to cause the output of op\namp 2 to be negative . When the\npolarity change occurs, op amp 2\nswitches its output level from negative\nto positive.

The output from op amp 2 is high when\nthe input voltage is within the voltage window and is low when the input is outside\nthe window .\n\nthe steering diode D1 , exceeds the\nwindow-width setting. Op amp 2 then\nreverts to its negative value .\nIn window comparators that consist\nof two simple level comparators , two\nreference voltages are required .\nThese voltages can drift in opposite\ndirections, making the window too\nlarge or too small (or nonexistent).\nWhen a narrow window is required (for\nexample , 10 millivolts in a 1a-volt\nrange), the upper and lower reference\nvoltages must be stable to 1 part in\n10,000 .

The\nintegrator achieves high speed by\nexploiting , in the ALU , all 50 of the\nFPLA AND gates in a gate-sharing\narrangement affording full carry/\nlookahead compatibility with minimum\ngate delays .\nThe form of the integrator is shown\nin the figure ; it consists of an ALU\nadder and a memory (accumulator) .\nTo read (and discard) an integral while\nsimultaneously starting a new integral,\n\nd j INPUT\n\nA\n\nALU\n\n(ADDER)\n\nJ\nI\n\nN\n\nMEMORY\n(ACCUMULATOR)\n\nL\n\ndiOUTPUT\n\no\n\nfe\nDigital Circuit Can Integrate and Dump without losfng data or clock cycles. The\n48-bit carry Ilookahead adder uses 16 logiC arrays, each programed as a 3-bit adder.\n\nthe ALU must be capable of adding\ntwo numbers or "passing " only one of\nthem. Because circuit-board space\nwas at a premium and no commercially available ALU in 0.3-inch (0 .76-cm)\npin spacing met all the circuit\n\nrequirements, an FPLA was programed to do the job .\nThe field-programable logic array is\nan integrated-circuit chip with internal\nconnections that can be arranged by\nthe user after manufacture . The chip\n(continued on next page)\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, Wint er 1979\n\n465\n\ncontains 50 AND gates, each of which\nmay be programed to AND any of 12\ninput variablp-:,.. Any combination of\nthe AND-gate outputs can be connected to any of six OR gates on the\nchip ; the output from the chip consists\nof the outputs of the OR gates (which\ncan be inverted , if desired).\nFor this application , the FPLA is\nprogramed as a 3-bit adder (A + B)\nwith gating to make B be zero to the\nadder when the " pass A" function is\nactivated. The adder has the auxiliary\nG and P outputs required for compatibility with commercially-available\ncarry/lookahead components , such\nas the 74182 chip . Sixteen FPLA\'s are\n\ncombined with 74182 \'s in a standard\ncarry/lookahead connection to create\na 48-bit adder having only five gate\ndelays .\nBecause the 50 gates available in\nthe FPLA are insufficient to make a\n4-bit lookahead adder, an alternative\nmechanization was considered . In that\nmechanization , each FPLA is programed to provide two 2-bit ripplecarry adders affording the " A + B"\nand " pass A" functions . A 48-bit\nadder using this 4-bit approach has\nfewer IC\'s than one with the 3-bit\napproach , but is much slower because\neach adder must wait for the carry\nfrom the preceding adder.\n\nPending commercial availability of a\n74S381-like device designed to have a\n" pass A" function in its repertoire , the\n3-bit-adder arrangement will meet\nreal-time data integrate-and-dump requirements without either holding up\nthe data stream for one clock cycle or\nusing external gating to clear the\nintegrator, or losing a datum while the\nintegrator is cleared on a given clock\ncycle.\nThis work was done by Arthur L.\nRubin, Herbert Taylor, and David E.\nWallis of Caltech for NASA\'s Jet\nPropulsion Laboratory.

Developed\nfor astronomical measurements , the\ncircuit is also useful in such applications as fire detection and photographic processing . Unlike previous\nlow-level-light detectors, the new\ncircuit is relatively simple and uses\ninexpensive, readily available components .\nThe sensor is a pyroelectric crystal ,\na device that develops an electric\ncharge when it is heated unevenly.\nThe sensor is sensitive to the heat\ncreated by light levels as low as\n3x1 0- 10 watt per square centimeter,\nfor which it produces a signal of 0.1\nmicrovolt.\nThe circuit amplifies this weak\nsignal to useful voltage levels , rejecting background noise . In fact , the\ncircuit functions without electrical\nshielding in a room with fluorescent\nlights , which generate large amounts\nof electrical interference . The light to\nthe sensor is modulated at a fixed\nfrequency by passing it through slots\nin a rotating disk . At the same time ,\nthe frequency response of the amplifier is restricted to a small passband\naround the chopping frequency . Thus,\nnoise at frequenc ies outside the\npassband is eliminated .\nLight from the source is chopped at\na frequency of 107 hertz by a threebladed mechanical chopper driven by\na synchronous motor (Figure 1). The\nchopper also interrupts a beam from a\nlight-emitting diode (LED). producing\na square-wave reference signal at the\noutput of a photodiode.

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nA circuit protects all the output lines\nof a switching regulator against overloads without requiring current sensors on every line . It includes a delay\nnetwork to inhibit operation during\nstartup , when the regulator output\nvoltage is low and surge current is\nhigh . The circuit compares the voltage\ndrop in a current-sensing winding to a\nreference voltage, and if an overload\nis indicated , it short-circuits the bias\non the switching transistor so that\npower is rapidly cut off from the loads.\nIn the voltage regulator (Figure 1),\nthe three secondary windings of\ntransformer T are closely coupled\nmagnetically, so a load change\nmodifies the output of the sensor\nwinding (winding 6-7) .

A set of\nsuch chips constitutes a complete\nazimuth correlator module, and a\nnumber of these modules could make\nreal-time signal processing possible .\nOf course , the chips would be smaller\nand use less power than conventional\ncircuitry .\nEach azimuth correlator chip would\ncontain all required memory, buffers ,\n\ncontrol, timing, multiplexing, and\noutput circuitry . The SAR processor\nwould require 1,020 chips (255 to a\ncorrelator module), to perform an\nazimuth correlation of data from thE!\nSEASAT satellite to produce 20-kmswath imagery with 25-m resolution,\nfour looks . Each correlator module\ncomputes a single look of the SAR\nimage.\nEach azimuth correlator chip receives data from the range correlator\nvia an input sample bus (see figure) as\n\na contiguous sequence of "range\nlines ." Each range line comprises\n5,1 20 complex data samples accompanied by several sync signals . During\na range-line processing cycle the\nazimuth correlator selects the appropriate set of 1,152 complex data\nsamples from each range line, multiplies each data sample by the\nappropriate complex azimuth reference-function (ARF) coefficients, and\nadds this product via a complex adder\nto the appropriate cell in the accumulator register.\n(continued on next page)\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1979\n\n469\n\nAt the end of an image-line\nprocessing cycle, the output of the\ncomplex adder is switched to the\noutput driver, and the 1,152 complex\nimage-line samples are read out. The\nimage-line memory, a shift register, is\nfilled with zero levels during the\nimage-line readout process .\nThe input samples are accompanied\nby a number of synchronization\nsignals : (a) the range-line sync that\ndenotes the beginning of the range\nline, (b) a sample sync that denotes\nwhen a data sample is valid, (c) a\nmultiplex sync that delineates subsets\nof range-line samples, and (d) a\ncomposite sync that is used to transfer\ncomposite coefficients from chip to\nchip .\nThree sets of coefficient formats are\nused to process data samples corresponding to one range line .

A miniature DPDT " half-sizecrystal-can " relay (see figure) was\nselected after examining numerous\nconventional coaxial relay configurations .

Beyond its\noriginal intent - to characterize the\nNASA standard list of discretes\nrecommended for aerospace applications - the test results should interest\nusers of these components in other\ncritical applications . Much of the\nmaterial could also assist engineers\nand others in setting up similar test\nprograms.\nThe initial series of reports covers\n39 devices 22 diodes and 17\ntransistors . The first 20 of these\nreports are described in this issue of\nNASA Tech Briefs . The remaining 19\nwill be described in Vol. 5, NO. 1.\nAmong the transistors are one FET\nand four dual-element packages . The\ndiodes include switching units and\nZeners . All are designed to meet\nMIL-spec performance standards .\nIn broad outline, the test procedures are the same for all components . They differ in particulars, such\nas electrical parameters measured,\nfor the different kinds of devices\n\ntested. For the power-stress tests , a\nsample population is stressed at levels\nthat increase In steps from half\nmaximum rated power (MAP) to 1.75\nMAP . Each power-stress step is held\nfor 500 hours at constant ambient\ntemperature of 25\xc2\xb0 C. Following each\nstep , key electrical parameters are\nmeasured , and a tally of any failed\nunits Is recorded . Failed units include\nthose for which the electrical checks\nfall out of MIL limits by 50 percent or\nmore , those for which leakage current\nexceeds the maximum limit by 100\ntimes or more, and shorted or\nopen-circuit units .\nThe temperature-stress measurements are carried out in two groups . In\nthe first group , the measurements are\nmade in 160-hour steps starting at\n75\xc2\xb0C and increasing in 25\xc2\xb0 C\nincrements to 300\xc2\xb0 C. In the other\ngroup, the steps are for 16 hours\nduration each , commencing at 150\xc2\xb0 C\nand increasing in 25\xc2\xb0 C intervals to\n300\xc2\xb0 C. In both groups , the components are held at their maximum-rated\n(continued on next page)\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1979\n\n473\n\npower during each step, and they are\ntested for electrical behavior following\neach step . The combination of applied\npower and increasing case temperature causes the device junction\ntemperature to rise above the manufacturer\'s rating, typically 175 0 to\n200 0 C, in all of these tests. A tally of\nfailed units is kept, as in the\npower-stress measurements.\nThe standard procedure for each\ncomponent is to take 48 samples from\neach of two manufacturers, to divide\neach sample into three groups of 16\nunits each, and to apply power stress\nto a group of 16 from each manufacturer ; temperature stress is similarly\napplied to two groups of 16 from each\nmanufacturer. Two units from each\nmanufacturer are used as control\nsamples .\nFor all units , data are presented as\ngraphs showing cumulative failures (in\npercent) for the temperature-stress\ngroup and as tables showing how the\nelectrical parameters changed during\neach test phase . An analysis of the\ntest results and the reasons for\nfailures are given in the concluding\nsections of the reports .

The majority of the failures did not occur until the + 275 0 C\ntemperature step. At that pOint the\ndevices experienced junction temperatures above + 500 0 C. Apparently the\ndevices failed due to electrical/thermal\noverstress, damaging the internal\ndiode junctions. This conclusion is supported by the presence of low breakdown with soft and resistive curve\ntraces and by the absence of surface\nleakage.\nThis work was done by the Special\nProducts Division of DCA Reliability\nLaboratory for Marshall Space Flight\nCenter.

The\ndiodes apparently failed due to heat\ngenerated by the excess power. The\nfailure modes included metal melting,\nwhich disconnected and shorted internal die connections, and alloying of\nthe metal with the silicon .\nIn Group II testing, many visual failures were seen in samples from both\nmanufacturers. These visual failures\nsuggest that both lots failed because\nthey were unable to withstand the high\ntemperature developed by the thermalstress test There was universal failure\nof the seal between the tubulation and\nglass.

Testing of\nthe Motorola diodes was stopped in all\nthree groups because the 50-percentfailures limit was reached. The Siemens\nlot endured 25 more hours of Group I\ntesting and 480 more hours of Group II\ntesting before being stopped, and the\nSiemens lot completed the entire\nGroup III testing with one catastrophic\nfailure.\nBecause of an apparent failure\nmode, failure analysis was performed\non the Group II testing. The majority of\nthe devices were visual catastrophic\nfailures due to the stress. Most of the\nSiemens failures were caused by the\nanode lead detaching due to the\nstress. In the Motorola lot, the cup-tostud detached, and the device came\napart. Failure analysis also revealed a\nloss of the glass seal tubulation and\nwire lead on the Siemens devices.\nThis work was done by the Special\nProducts Division of DCA Reliability\nLaboratory for Marshall Space Flight\nCenter.

Of the\nthree stress groups, Group II proved to\nbe the most detrimental to both sample\nlots. Many of the Siemens diodes had\nhard breakdowns that did not change\nwhen measured at any current between 1 microampere and 1 milliampere. The fact that they were within\ntheir breakdown limits at earlier measurement points suggests that there\nwere originally junction defects present, which caused the devices to\noperate at a lower voltage . These\natomic-level defects were " burned\nout " of the dice , thus allowing the true\nbreakdowns to appear.\nThe Motorola samples each contain\ntwo dice in series, possibly as a means\n\n476\n\nof tailoring the breakdown voltage to\nthe desired value . When measured at\nlow and high currents (1 .0 JJ.A. and 1.0\nmA), two distinct breakdowns can be\nseen . As with the Siemens devices, the\nchange to higher breakdowns after\nsome hundreds of hours of stress can\nbe explained by the burning out of diffusion spikes from the junction, again\nallowing the true breakdowns to appear.\nThis work was done by the Special\nProducts Division of DCA Reliability\nLaboratory for Marshall Space Flight\nCenter.

The Micro Semiconductor\ndiodes experienced no failures in\nGroup II and Group III testing and had\nonly four failures in Group I.\nThere were two types of failures\nthroughout all three stress tests for\nboth manufacturers. One was a visual\ncatastrophic reject. The failures were\nstill within the electrical limits of the\ntest when they became visual failures\ndue to a loss of an external lead .\nThe second type of failure was\nreverse-bias leakage. The main cause\nof this failure was the conductive\nexternal paint on the diodes. When the\ncontinuity of the paint was disturbed,\nthe reverse leakage fell to acceptable\nlevels.\nThis work was done by the Special\nProducts Division of DCA Reliability\nLaboratory for Marshall Space Flight\nCenter.

The majority of the\nMicro Semiconductor device failures\n\noccurred because of detached leads.\nExcessive IR leakage was the major\ncause of failure among the Semtech\nlot.

The Micro\nSemiconductor lot continued processing 500 hours further into the testing\nthan the Unitrode lot, and the Micro\nSemiconductor diodes completed the\nentire Group II and Group III testing\nwithout a catastrophic failure .\nFailure analysis was performed only\non Group II testing because of an apparent failure mode. Most catastrophic\nfailures of the Unitrode diodes were\ndue to detaching of the anode lead.\nThe Micro Semiconductor diode has\na shaped junction edge, a feature lacking in the Unitrode part. Junction shaping causes the breakdown stress to be\nshifted into the bulk of the semiconductor and away from the leakage on the\nsurface. This approach is often success~ul in significantly increasing\nbreakdown voltages and reducing leakage.\nThis work was done by the Special\nProducts Division of DCA Reliability\nLaboratory for Marshall Space Flight\nCenter.

The failure rate\nof the Semtech diodes exceeded 50\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1979\n\npercent in all three stress tests at the\nfirst sequence point. For one device,\nthe failure was directly attributed to a\ncrack in the die, assumed to be caused\nfrom a poor die attach during assembly\nand subsequent operation. Another device was cross-sectioned at two different angles, and no visible anomalies\nwere noted. The failure modes could\nnot be precisely determined, although\nunseen microcracks across the junction are a suspected possible cause .\nIn both of the temperature-stress\ntests, the Semtech devices exhibited\nleakage because of conductive external paint, which bridged between\nthe anode and cathode leads, and because of hygroscopic glass (which is\nprotected from moisture as long as the\npaint is undamaged).\nArcing was clearly visible in the\npaint when one device was placed\nunder reverse bias of several hundred\nvolts . The paint of one device was\nchemically removed, after which the\nleakage could be varied at will over a\nlarge range by changing the device\nambient atmosphere. A dry gas stream\nplayed over the diode at room temperature produced low leakage. Free\nair produced instability and high leakage. A 1-minute hydrofluoric acid etch\nwas used to remove any possible invisible conductive residue of the paint.\nAfter this treatment, the glass was still\nhygroscopic.\nThis work was done by the Special\nProducts Division of DCA Reliability\nLaboratory for Marshall Space Flight\nCenter.

The testing of both lots\nwas stopped in Group I. In Group II and\nGroup III there were no Micro Semiconductor catastrophic failures. Therefore , only Group I was submitted for\nfailure analysis.\nIn the case of the one analyzed\nSemtech sample and all of the analyzed Micro Semiconductor samples,\nthe silicon die was still within acceptable electrical limits when the external\nlead became detached due to melting\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1979\n\nof the connecting metal. The curvetracer pattern of the remaining analyzed Semtech diodes indicates that\nthese devices failed due to a combination of junction damage and surface\ncontamination, with the junction damage predominating .\nThis work was done by the Special\nProducts Division of DCA Reliability\nLaboratory for Marshall Space Flight\nCenter.

The hard breakdown curves of\nthese samples, taken together with\ntheir acceptable leakage levels at\n1,000 volts bias during earlier tests,\nsuggests that the surface-charge migration mechanism as described\nabove was the cause of the failures.\nThis work was done by the Special\nProducts Division of DCA Reliability\nLaboratory for Marshall Space Flight\nCenter.

In Group I, the\nMicro Semiconductor lot was stopped\n250 hours before the end of the process, but all eight failures occurred in\nthe 175-percent MRP step. The six\nSemtech failures occurred in lower\nMRP steps.\nFailure analysis was performed on\nGroup I and Group II because of an apparent failure mode . Almost all of the\nSemtech failures and many of the Micro\nSemiconductor failures were due to excessive IR leakage. In addition, the remaining Micro Semiconductor devices\nthat failed were still within the electrical limits of the test when they became visual failures due to the loss of\ntheir anode leads. This suggests that\nthese structural failures were caused\nby exceeding the thermal design limits.\nIn the case of the Semtech parts,\nthe curve trace at peak inverse voltage\nindicates a condition of surface instability due to contamination . This\ncontamination can move under the influence of temperature and bias. The\nanalyzed samples were IR rejects because their breakdowns drifted below\n1,000 volts. The hard, stable breakdown of these samples indicates that\nthere is no junction damage. The\nmost probable cause of the lowered\nbreakdown voltage is a change in the\nconcentration of surface impurities on\nthe pn junction.\nWhen there is a slight concentration\nof impurities of the same polarity as the\nhigh-resistivity side of the junction (not\nsufficient to cause inversion), then that\nresistivity will be raised. This in turn will\nraise the breakdown voltage . Upon the\nmigration of these protective charges\n\nJANTX1 N5614\nSwitching Diode\nThe effects of power and\ntemperature overstress\nSemtech and Micro Semiconductor\nwere the manufacturers.

However,\nthe Micro Semiconductor lots were\nprocessed about 100 hours longer than\nthe Semtech lots in each case.\n(continued on next page)\n477\n\nThe Semtech failures were all due to\nexcess reverse leakage current. Failure analysis of Groups I and 11 revealed\nthat these failures were caused by conductive external paint. When a band of\npaint was removed from each diode to\ninterrupt the electrical conductivity,\nthe diodes performed within acceptable test limits.\nThe failure mode for the Micro\nSemiconductor lots was ",ainly visual ,\nbut there were some IA failures also.\nThe Group I diodes failed due to glass\nand silicon breakage caused by exposure to excessive power-generated\nheat. The three diodes submitted to\nfailure analysis from the Group III sample lot exhibited significant drift in\nbreakdown voltage and leakage during\nthe curve-tracer tests . The parts\nseemed to be affected by surface contamination .

With proper information\non the processor output bus , any or all\nthe power switches may be set (turned\non) or reset (turned off) .\nEach power switch supplies power\nto groups (PG) of logic elements, each\nof which constitutes a subset of the\ntotal system . The subsets are so\ndefined that one or more of these\nswitches may be turned off at various\ntimes without affecting the intended\noperation of the system . The total\nnumber of subsets depends largely on\nthe complexity of the system (i.e ., the\nnumber of different operating modes)\nand on how well the logic is\npartitioned. Sometimes it becomes\nnecessary to add redundant circuitry\nto avoid overlapping of these subsets .\nTransients , the main problem in\npower switching, are not eliminated .\nInstead the output signal associated\n484\n\nI\'\n\n:/\n\nPROCESSOR\nCONTROL\n\nI\n\nTIMER\nCONTROL\n\n:>-:-\n\n~\n\nDELAYED\nCLOCK\n\nI}~~\'~~\n\n.\nPGSWITCH\nCONTROL\n\nPG\nENABLES\n\n,r:}\n\nSWITCH\nCONTROLS\n\n.....\n, .....\n+5V, ,\nCONTINUOUS\n\nY\n\nSWITCH\n\nI\n\nJ\n\nSWITCH\n\nl\n\n}\n\n+5 V, lo PG1\n\n+5 V, to PG2\n\nThis Power-Control Circuitry applies power only to circuits being used at a given\ntime interval.

It was determined that\nexisting nuclear batteries , although\nlong lived, lacked the power required\nfor most applications . Thus , a new\n.approach was tried , involving the\nintermediate conversion of particle\nkinetic energy into optical energy. This\nhas been named a tertiary-nuclear\nbattery according to the following\nclassification of ways of converting the\nkinetic energy of particle radiation into\nel~ctrical energy :\nPrimary: Charged particle emissions from a radiosotope placed on\none electrode are collected on the\nsecond electrode. When there is an\nelectrostatic field between electrodes , the particles constitute\nmoving charges in the field .\nSecondary: Particle kinetic energy\nproduces electron-hole pairs near\npn junctions in semiconductors or in\na gaseous medium between two\ndissimilar metals . [Radioisotope\nthermal generators (RTG\'s), where\nparticle kinetic energy is converted\ninto thermal energy for further conversion into electricity also belong\nin this category] .\ntertiary: Particle kinetic energy is\nconverted to light pulses in phosphors such as Csl , Nal , or ZnS.

Standard cells and electronic equipment could be readily\ncompared and calibrated to this\nstandard . The IC, fed by a fixedfrequency microwave source , could\nproduce 1 volt with an accuracy of 1\npart in 106 . That is comparable to the\nU.S. standard volt, also based on the\nJosephson junction but maintained in\nits superconducting state by very\nsophisticated equipment at\nthe\nNational Bureau of Standards .\nThe IC forming the heart of the new\ncalibration instrument consists of a\nglass substrate 1 in .

(0 .81 mm) thick having a\nrelative dielectric constant of 5 to 6.\nTwo lead-film circuit patterns , each\ndefining a resonator , are vacuumdeposited on its surface in a threestep process : One film is deposited to\ndefine one resonator ; it is oxidized to\nform an oxide layer , and a second film\nis deposited to form the second\nresonator . The deposition is through\ncarefully-designed stencil masks .

With greater turbulence, it\nis found that the air boundary layer\nfollows the turbine blade contours over\na longer distance before separating .\nThe air thus transfers more energy to\nthe blades with lower blade drag.\nThe turbine exhausts into an expansion chamber , from which the airflow\nemanates through guide vanes into a\nventuri cavity . The venturi cavity is\noriented by a servomechanism into the\nwind . With the wind flowing through it,\nit acts as an aspirator, drawing air\nfrom the turbine into the windstream .\nThe guide vanes and cavity eliminate a\ncommon problem with vertical exhaust\ntubes such as chimneys - that is, the\nback pressure , or " pinch-off" effect\nexterted by the wind, particularly at\nlow windspeeds .\nSeveral wind amplifiers have been\nconsidered , including various funnels\nand venturi shapes, toroids. with or\nwithout movable flaps, and Archimedic spirals .

The\nmeasurement of this quantity is very\nimportant in the development of\nefficient solar cells .

The alcohol is introduced via\nhypodermic applicators through tubes\nfeeding into each substrate . This\nprocedure eliminates about 4 percent\nof transmissivity loss due to reflection\nat the airgap.\nThe apparatus measures transmissivity ratios accurately to three decimal places . A standard digital voltmeter may also be used instead of the\nratiometer. In this case, the voltmeter\ninternal reference is disconnected and\nconnected to the reference solar-cell\ndetector, while the voltmeter input is\nconnected to the second cell.\nThis work was done by Eric G.

However , the life of these\ndevices is much shorter than that of\nsimilar devices operating at longer\nwavelengths . The preferred p dopant\nis zinc because high doping levels\ncannot be achieved using germanium\nin aluminum-rich layers without seriously affecting the structural and optical properties of the device. However,\ntests indicate that simultaneous doping with Ge and Zn improves the\nresistance to degradation , thus opening up prospects for greatly increased\nreliability in lasers and LED \'s operating at 7,500 Aand below.\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1979\n\nA possible contributing factor to the\ndegradation\nof\nshort-wavelength\nlasers could be the generation of point\ndefects in the p-type confining layer by\nthe energy released in nonradiative\nrecombination. Once the point defect\nis generated , its movement into the\nrecombination zone and interference\nwith radiative recombination may be\naccelerated by the relatively high\nstress occurring in the material. The\nGe could be effective in preventing\npoint defect generation . This may be\nthe result of a local interaction, Zn and\nGe occupying different lattice sites ,\nwhich reduces the probability of\natomic displacement. 80th dopants\nare p type in (AIGa)As, but they\n\noocupy different sites : the Ge fills As\nsites , the Zn fills Ga sites . Also, if\ndislocations exist , the presence of Ge\nand Zn as impurities could prevent\ntheir motion.\nThe preferred method of doubledoping with Zn and Ge is to incorporate equal quantities of each . The\nbenefits of the improved reliability are\nderived when the dopants are simultaneously introduced into the bounding\np-type {AIGa)As layer of the heterojunction structure . It is believed that\nthe formation of vacancies produced\nby the electron-hole recombination\nwithin that layer , vacancies that would\nnormally diffuse into the recombination region and reduce the life of the\ndevice , is minimized .\n(continued on next page)\n\n491\n\nThis work was done by Henry\nKressel and Ivan Ladany of RCA Corp.\nfor\nLangley\nResearch\nCenter.\nFurther information may be found in\nNASA CR-3045 [N78-32405INSP] ,\n" 1. 1 Micrometer and Visible Emission\n\nLasers "\nSemi-Conductor\nDiode\n[$6 .50] .

Most\nof such heterojunction lasers grown\nvia vapor epitaxy have suffered from\nthermal decomposition at interfacial\nregions . The vapor growth of multilayered group III-V heterostructures\ngenerally involves preheating the previously grown layer to the same\ntemperature used for growth , typically\n700\xc2\xb0 C, before growth commences.\nThis techn ique leads to thermal\ndecomposition , which produces many\ndislocation loops , which in turn degrade minority-carrier properties .\nWhen a group III-V compound is\nheated , the group V element often has\na higher partial vapor pressure than\nthe group III element , result ing in a\npreferential loss of the group V\n\nspec ies and in globules of the group III\nelements being left on the crystal\nsurface. This is particularly true of\ncompounds containing phosphorus\nbecause of high vapor pressure near\nthe growth temperature .

It could also be\nused for X-ray or gamma-ray astronomy .\nThe new detector is filled to a\npressure of 2 atmospheres with a\nmixture of 95 percent xenon and 5\npercent methane for recording hard\nX-ray (50- to 100-keV) images with a\nspatial resolution of about a millimeter . Being sealed , \'the detector\nrequires no gas purification or replenishment after the initial fill .\nThe detector electrode configuration is illustrated in the figure. It reads\nthe coordinates by the Borkowski/\nKopp differential time measurement of\ninduced cathode signals.

As a result , a significant\namount of time and money are spent\nin manually separating the useful data .\nA great savings could be realized if\ncircuits aboard the satellite could\nrecognize useless imagery or actually\nlook for specific features . The circuitry\ndoes not have to be very "smart" to\nbe useful. For example, about 70 percent of the Earth \'s surface is water . Of\nthe 30 percent that is not water , about\none-third to one-half will be obscured\nby clouds at any given time .\nThis means that a satellite making\nobservations at periodic intervals may\nget one clear picture of land out of\nperhaps five or six observations . The\namount of unwanted data to be stored,\nprocessed , and indexed could, therefore , be greatly reduced by a circuit\nthat simply blocked transmission of\nthe 80 percent of the imagery that is of\nwater and clouds .\nA simple circuit has been developed\nto classify picture elements by spectral signature alone . No pattern\nrecognition is required . Computer\nsimulations and field measurements\nhave confirmed that the four basic\nfeature types - vegetation , bare land,\nwater , and clouds or snow - can be\nseparated by radiance measurements\nat two discrete wavelengths : 650 and\n850 nanometers .\nGreen vegetation is dark at 650 nm\ndue to the chlorophyll absorption\nband ; but vegetation is characteristic;:ally very bright in the near-infrared\naround 850 nm . Water is just the\nopposite ; it reflects red light reasonably well but absorbs nearly all nearinfrared radiation. Bare land , clouds,\nand snow are between these extremes . They appear somewhat brighter at 650 nm than at 850 nm, but the\nradiance ratio is much smaller than for\nwater . Furthermore , clouds and snow\nare much brighter than most bare-land\nforms at 650 nm.

These\ncameras could be the primary science\nsensors of the satellite or could be\nspecially provided for the scene\nanalysis . Comparator U1 checks for a\nhigh ratio of red to infrared radiance,\nwhich would indicate water . U2\nchecks for a high ratio of infrared to\nred radiance , which would indicate\nvegetation . U3 compares the red\nsensor output with a reference\nvoltage .\nThe logic circuitry following the\ncomparators combines the outputs of\nU1 , U2, and U3 to divide the red/lR\nplane into regions approximating the\npolygons of Figure 1. One, and only\none , of the logic outputs will be high\n\nfor any sensor-output voltage pair .\nTypically, these logic signals would\ngate pixel-rate clock pulses to counters so that, at the end of the scanning\nperiod , the counters would contain\ncounts of the total number of pixels\nthat were classified in each of the four\ncategories . A little added logic could\nthen inhibit the transmission of data if\nthe cloud and/or water pixel counts\nexceeded a selected value .\nTwo modifications to the circuit in\nFigure 2 are required for a practical\ncircuit. The comparator outputs\nshould be latched so that the logic\noutputs will not be changing during a\nclock pulse ; and the threshold voltage\nshould be varied as a function of local\nSun angle , since the threshold separating clouds from bare lands is a\nfunction of scene illumination.

Although quartz maser\nbulbs are normally coated with a thin\nFEP layer, the coating tends to wear\non the surface opposite the entrance\nstem because of bombardment by\nenergetic atoms and ultraviolet light\ngenerated by hydrogen dissociation .\nThe problem is solved by putting a\nhole in the storage bulb at a point\n\nopposite the entrance stem and\nplacing a thick FEP plug in the hole .\n(The plug is inserted after the interior\nof the bulb has been coated with the\nusual FEP layer.) Although heavy\natoms and ultraviolet light strike the\nplug and coating with the same\nintensity , the plug lasts longer than the\ncoating because it is hundreds of\ntimes thicker.\nThe FEP plug replaces a beamstop plate at either the hydrogen\n\ndissociator or the state-selecting\nmagnet. The beam stop was unsatisfactory because it reduced the flow of\nstate-selected hydrogen in the same\nproporton as it reduced the amount of\nheavy atoms and ultraviolet light.\nThis work was done by John J .\nDeLuca and Victor S.

This computer program\nwas developed to incorporate a new\ntechnique called the iterative forwardadjoint Monte Carlo method . In this\ntechnique, the adjoint Monte Carlo\nmethod is used to reduce the variance\nof the forward Monte Carlo method for\na given amount of computer time .\nThe technique utilizes the fact that\nthe adjoint fluence determined in an\nadjoint Monte Carlo calculation can be\nused to calculate altered sampling\ndistributions (for source parameters,\npath length , and past-collision parameters) , which can then be used in the\nforward calculation . Random sampling\nfrom these altered distributions , instead of the natural distributions,\nresults in a reduced variance of the\neffects of interest because the most\nimportant part of the distribution is\nsampled most often. The forward\nfluence determined in the forward\nMonte Carlo calculation can likewise\nbe used to alter the distribution\nfunction of the adjoint calculation .\nBy iteratively performing both the\nforward and the adjoint calculations\nand updating the altered sampling\ndistributions between each calculation , the variance can be reduced in a\nrelatively small number of iterations .\nThe fluence estimates approach the\nactual value with each iteration, thus\nimproving the altered distribution functions and improving the effect-ofinterest estimates .\nThis computer program is written in\nFORTRAN IV for batch execution and\n\nhas been implemented on the UNIVAC\n1108 with a central memory requirement of approximately 64K of 36-bit\nwords .

The second program the\nSimulation Program - exercises the\nresulting computer model to perform\ncost and potential utilization analysis.\nIt handles input, output, and integration of system dynamics and iterates\nto obtain convergence of variables\ninvolved in implicit loops . The combination of these two programs is a\npowerful tool for analyzing alternate\nstorage-system designs.\nThe SIMWEST library comprises\nfive types of component: physical ,\nenvironmental , load , logical , and\nutility . Physical components model\nactual physical hardware that might be\nused in a wind-energy system and\nencompass such things as motors ,\ngenerators , transmissions, and flywheels . Environmental components\nare those that simulate environment\nconditions (e .g . , windspeed and\nambient temperature) and are generally used as inputs to physical components . The load components in the\nSIMWEST library simulate various\ntypes of power demand , monitor how\nwell the system meets the simulated\ndemand , and compute the value of the\nenergy delivered by the wind-energy\nsystem to the load . The logical\n500\n\ncomponents of the library determine\nhow power is divided or distributed\nwithin a specified load and storage\nsystem and thus provide an idealized\nway to model the control function ,\nwhich in practice might be performed\nby a control-room operator or minicomputer. Finally, the utility components include the tape read , the\nhistogram, and the cost monitor that\nall serve to help the program user run\nthe simulation and analyze its results .\nThe program was written in\nFORTRAN IV, for use on a UNIVAC\n1100 computer .\nThis program was written by L.

Most of the available\ndigital image-analysis software systems require computer expertise and\nremote-sensing knowledge that is not\nusually available to the small-scale\nuser . The Landsat Signature Development Program (LSDP) automatically\nproduces an unsupervised classification of a scene from a Landsat data\ntape . Use of the LSDP requires only a\nbasic understanding of computer and\n\nremote-sensing procedures . The program is effective enough to be useful\nto the sophisticated remote-sensing\nanalyst , yet is simple enough to be\nutilized in the initial training of\nstudents in remote-sensing techniques . The LSDP should be very\nuseful to the investigator who is more\nfamiliar with the ground truth of the\narea to be analyzed than with image\nprocessing .\nThe LSDP classification scheme is\nbased on the clustering tendencies of\nthe multispectral scanner data within\nLandsat scenes . A rotation matrix,\ncomputed from the matrix of eigenvectors , is used to realine the data to\nimprove the overall effectiveness of\nthe band-by-band classification approach . Once transformed , the covariant terms are assumed to be zero .\nPixels that occur less than a specified\nnumber of times are removed from the\ndata before transformation . Each\ncluster is formed by examining all\npixels within a fixed distance of a seed\npixel and then accepting only pixels\nthat do not change the variance by\nmore than a chi-square distribution\nwould permit.\nCluster pairs with a mean separation within a certain hyperellipsoidal\nregion are merged . When all of the\nclusters have been reduced to a stable\ngroup , they are inspected for overlaps\nin\nthe\nthree\nstandard-deviation\nranges . Overlaps are resolved by the\nmaximum-likelihood rule , using the\nmean frequencies as the a priori\nfactors . The result of the processing is\na set of nonoverlapping regions in the\ndata space . Pixels that fall within\nthese regions are assigned unique\ncharacters and mapped from that data\nset. The LSDP generates a line-printer\nmap of the scene with each unique\ncharacter representing a unique spectral signature . The program also\ngenerates tables describing the spectral properties of each signature ,\ncertain interclass relationships ,dent\nstatistics , and processing infomation .\nThis program is written in FORTRAN\nand has been implemented on an\nHIS-635 computer with a core memory\nrequirement of approximately 27K of\n36-bit words using the overlay feature .\nThe LSDP was developed in 1978.\nThis program was written by Roy A.\nBland of Kennedy Space Center and\nRoyce Hall of Computer Sciences\nCorp.

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nTwo normally-independent purification treatments sulfur dioxide\nscrubbing from stack gas and wastewater purification - could be combined in a single two-stage process,\nmaking both treatments more efficient\nand more economical. According to\nthe results of preliminary tests, the\nacidic solution generated by the\nscrubbing cycle could be used to\nreduce the bacterial content of wastewater . 80th processes would also\nbenefit by sharing small concentrations of iron as a catalyzing, accelerating, and flocculating agent.\nS02 scrubbing by aqueous solutions\nto form sulfurous acid has been\npreviously investigated . Without catalytic enhancement, S02 absorption by\nwater is limited to less than 8 pounds\n(3 .6 kg) per 1,000 gal (3,780 I).\nHowever, under certain conditions,\nthe sulfite radical can be oxidized to\nsulfate, which allows more S02 to be\nabsorbed . This conversion depends on\nthe rate of oxygen absorption by\nwater . In this process the sulfite\nconversion to sulfate is enhanced by\nthe addition of 600 to 1,200 parts per\nmillion (ppm) of Iron in the scrubbing\nsolution and by maintaining the water\ntemperature at about 140 0 F (60 0 C) .\nSulfate precipitation is prevented\nwhile S02 absorption is continued by\nmaintaining the scrubbing solution at\nor near a pH of 2.0. This pH level also\nreduces wastewater coliform to acceptable levels . After the iron concentration and pH are adjusted from 50 to\n100 ppm and from 6.5 to 7.2,\nrespectively , complex iron hydroxides\nform, which provide coagulation and\nprecipitation of wastewater particulate\nimpurities. Thus, the acidic nature of\nstack gas and the iron catalysts in the\nscrubbing process could serve as a\nwastewater disinfectant and colloid\ndestabilizer. If all steps are carried out\nunder the right conditions and time\nsequence, stack-gas scrubbing and\nwastewater purification could proceed\nsimultaneously .\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1979\n\nWASTEWATER\nINLET\n\nTOWER 1\n\nIRON\nADDITION\n\nSOz-LADEN\nSTACK-GAS\nINLET\n\n~--------------~~\nCALCIUM\nSULFATE\nPRECIPITATOR\nWASTEWATER\nINLET\n\nNEUTRALIZER\n\nPURIFIEDWATF.R\nOUTLET\n\nThe Simultaneous Treatment of Wastewater and S02-Laden Stack Gas proceeds in\nthis two-cycle system. Most of the 502 scrubbing and some disinfection occur in\ntower 1; the tower 2 facility houses most of the disinfection and some scrubbing.\nAeration and neutralization of the tower 2 output encourage coagulation and\nprecipitation in the clarifier.\nAs shown in the figure, the proposed system consists of two scrubbing towers : Tower 1 is a partial\ncatalytic recycle loop ; tower 2 is an\nopen-loop "once-through" facility.\nWastewater enters the cycle at two\npoints . The S02-laden stack gas is fed\nto both towers from a common\nmanifold. Packing material in both\ntowers promotes exceJlent waler/gas\ncontact for effective scrubbing of the\ngas .\nWastewater enters the flow loop for\ntower 1 and passes through the ironaddition stage where the iron content\nis maintained at from 600 to 1,200\nppm . After passing through tower 1,\nthe pH is readjusted (if necessary) to\nabout 2.0 with lime in the calcium\n\nsulfate precipitator. Thus, continuous\nscrubbing of S02 and wastewater\ndisinfection proceed in tower 1 .\nA portion of the acidified ironenriched wastewater is withdrawn\nnear the tower 1 inlet and is passed to\ntower 2. Additional wastewater is\nadded to the slipstream from tower 1\nto reduce the iron content from 50 to\n100 ppm. After passing through tower\n2, the waterflow passes through an\naerator and is then neutralized with\nlime to a pH of from 6.5 to 7.2 .

Kennedy Space Center, Florida\nConcentrations of gaseous toxic\nmonomethylhydrazine (MMH) can be\nremoved at 99 .9 percent efficiency\nusing scrubbers containing acetylacetone solutions as scrubbing liquors.\nThe acetyl acetone converts the residual MMH in the waste scrubbing liquor\nto a nontoxic heterocyclic compound.\nThis approach reduces the cost of\nscrubbers that otherwise have to be\nprotected by an inert lining from\nextremely-corrosive oxidizing agents\nused in destroying the residual MMH\nand in addition makes the scrubbing\nsolution easily disposable.\nThe key to the reaction is shown in\nFigure 1. The residual MMH reacts in\naqueous solutions with acetylacetone\nto form 1 ,3,5-trimethylpyrazole (1 ,3,5TMP). Although there are no published\ntoxicity data for 1,3 ,5-TMP, sufficient\ndata are available about the toxicity of\nits parent compound pyrazole . Pyrazole is known to be relatively nontoxic\nat high concentrations . Preliminary\nresults with the waste scrubber liquor\ncontaining 1,3,5-TMP concentrations\nof 500 ppm (parts per million) have\nshown it to be nontoxic to water\nhyacinths, algae, and small frogs .\nFigure 2 shows the results obtained\nby scrubbing with 13 percent , pH 7.0\nacetylacetone solution . Although the\nscrubber inlet concentrations of MMH\nvary between 600 to 1,200 ppm , at no\npOint does its scrubber effluent concentration rise above the detectable 1\nppm .

The\nvalve costs much less to produce than\na precision needle-in-foil type. Yet its\nperformance closely matches that\nversion .\nA very small trapped volume eliminates pressure rise in the massspectrometer vacuum envelope during\nthe loss of power. Mechanical vacuum\npumps used on conventional leak\nvalves to reduce the pressure of\nmolecular leak are not necessary. A\ngold leak foil admits gases at a slow\nfixed-rate, permitting the device to be\nused at up io 1 atmosphere without\naffecting the vacuum environment .\nA solenoid-activated plunger (see\nfigure) admits the gas samples . The\nsamples enter a 0.15-1-11 dead volume\n(most commercial valves have a 20-1-11\ndead volume) between the valve seat\nand the gold leak foil. From there they\nare slowly passed through the foil into\nthe spectrometer.\nThe foil is held under compression\nagainst the bottom surface of the valve\nseat by a retainer screw that also\nserves as an exit tube for the gases . A\ngold friction washer prevents the foil\nfrom distoring as the retaining screw is\ntorqued down to constrain the foil.\nThe valve was successfully tested.\nIn the closed position, its leakage rate\nof less than 2x10- 11 cm 3 /s was\nmeasured by a helium-leak detector .\nSuch a low leakage level is very\nimportant during the loss of power\nwhen the valve remains shut.\nThis work was done by Charles M.\nJudson , James L. Lawrence, Jr ., and\nFrederick P. Pickett of Analog Technology Corp. for Langley Research\nCenter.

The valve has a very small 0.15-/A1 dead volume . An inSignificant\namount of gas trapped in that volume prevents any pressure buildup in the\nspectrometer vacuum envelope during a power shutdown. Conventional molecularleak valves with a larger dead volume of about 20 /AI require a mechanical pump to\nprevent that problem.\n\n505\n\nImproved Synthesis of Polyformals\nSynthesis time reduced from\nhours to minutes\nAmes Research Center, Moffett Field, California\nFormals of CH20H(CHOH)nCH20H\npolyols (n\n2 to 4) are prepared in\nless than 15 min as opposed to hours\nor days by conventional processes .\nThe new approach uses a mixture of\nsorbitol , or mannitol , and paraformaldehyde rapidly heated in the presence\nof an acidic catalyst . The process can\nbe carried in stages using almost\nstoichiometric quantities of paraformaldehyde without any change in the\noverall heating time. The product can\nbe converted into ethylenically unsaturated monomers and into aphrogenic\nand pyrostatic phosphorylated derivatives and the like .\nBasically, a powdered mixture of\nthe selected compound and a slight\nexcess of paraformaldehyde are\nstirred and rapidly heated in the\npresence of the catalyst to a temperature of about 125 0 C. Total heating\ntime lasts from about 5 to 15 min .\nDuring this period , the solids first turn\ninto a paste at about 70 0 C, liquefy at\nabout 100 0 C, and are finally converted into a dry powder at a temperature\n\n=\n\nbetween 115 0 and 125 0 C. The acidic\ncatalyst must be present in quantities\nbetween 0.1 to 1.0 mole-percent and\nmay include hydrochloric acid , sUlfuric acid , methanesulfonic acid , and\nzinc chloride with hydrochloric acid.\nFive successful experiments were\ncarried out. One used a mixture of\n18.2 g of sorbitol , 9.5 g of paraformaldehyde , 0.5 g of zinc chloride, and 4\nml of concentrated hydrochloric acid .\nA total of 20 .1 g (95 percent yield) of\nfine white powder was produced\nhaving a melting point between 214 0\nand 216 0 C. (1,3 :2,4 :5,6-trimethylenesorbitol is reported to melt at 212 0\nto 216 0 C.) A similar result was\nobtained using 5 g of 40 percent\nsulfuric acid instead of the zinc\nchloride / hydrochloric acid catalyst.\nA third two-stage process using\n9.1 g of sorbitol , 3.1 g of paraformaldehyde, and 1.3 g of 25 percent\nsulfuric acid produced 9.1 g of the fine\nwhite powder with the same meltingpoint range .\n\nIn the fourth experiment, the same\nmixture was used as in the first except\nsorbitol was substituted with 18.2 g\nmannitol. A combined total of 20.4 g\n(94 percent total yield) of white\npowder was produced that had a\nmelting point between 229 0 and\n230 0 C. (1,3:2,5:4,6-trimethylenemannitol is reported to melt at 232 0 to\n233 0 C.)\nA two stage process also using\nmannitol instead of sorbitol produced\n9.1 g of mannitol triformal with a\nmelting-point range of 230 0 to 231 0 C.\nThis work was done by Algirdas C.\nPoshkus of Ames Research Center.\nFor further information, Circle 45 on\nthe TSP Request Card.\nThis invention is owned by NASA,\nand a patent application has been\nfiled .

The technique\ncouples thermal diffusion and countercurrent natural convective flow to\nseparate liquids and gases in solutions . The reasons for its decline\nincluded large power requ irements ,\ncostly equipment , and small processing volumes. The materials separable\nby th is technique include :\n- aqueous biolog ical solutions ,\n-isotopes in both gas and liquid states ,\n\n506\n\n-aqueous solutions of both ionized and\nun-ionized materials ,\n-organic solutions ,\n-liquid metallic solutions, and\n- ortho- and para-hydrogen mixtures .\nFollowing a critical reexamination of\nits features , it was concluded that the\ntechnique may find few applications by\nutilizing modified cell designs or by\ncombining it with other separative\ntechn iques or such principles as\nelectrophoresis , field-flow fractionation , adsorption, and chemical reactions , particularly in space environments . Some potential applications on\nthe ground include solar water desali-\n\nnation , energy conversion devices ,\nand the utilization of waste heat.\nThe advantages to be realized in\nlow-gravity space environments are\nbased on the following considerations :\n- Reduced convective-flow velocities\nin low-g environments will allow\nlarger cell-wall spacings, allowing in\nturn larger throughputs and avoiding\n" parasitic " remixing .\n-Power requirements will be supplied\n" free " via solar heating and radiation\ncooling .\n- Larger allowable cell-wall spacings\nwill reduce equipment construction\ncosts .\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1979\n\n-The lack of gravity-induced mechanical stresses will allow longer cell\nlengths to be utilized, thereby increasing throughput.\n-A possibility of conducting CDS with\nfree-floating liquid spheres .\nThe present evaluation also investigates the possibility of improving\nefficiencies of the CDS technique by\naltering convective-flow patterns. The\nquestion of whether multicellular flow\nor turbulence can introduce a new\nseparation mechanism that would\nboost separation efficiencies at least\nan order of magnitude was considered\nbriefly . The results indjcate that\ncertain multicellular-flow patterns\nprobably can increase separation\nefficiencies . However, that has not\nbeen verified experimentally, primarily\n\nbecause of the difficulties in defining\nrequired boundary conditions for a\ngiven multicellular-flow pattern .\nThe findings also indicate the\ntechnique may be promising in the\nareas of biological and polymer\nseparations. Biological and polymer\nsolutes generally have high thermaldiffusion factors and so can be readily\nseparated with low power consumption . Furthermore, the ability of the\ntechnique to separate solute molecules on the basis of shape differences\nalone should present very exciting\npossibilities for the separations of\nsuch complicated biological materials,\nas DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) molecules , viruses , and "B" and " T"\nlymphocytes . The possibility of combining the technique with other tech-\n\nniques, especially with the field-flow\nfractionation technique, may produce\nsome positive results .\nThe thermal diffusion (Soret effect)\ncan generate potential gradients in\nelectrolytic solutions . Nonconvective\nliquid thermocells , therefore, can\nconvert heat into electricity. It has\nbeen reported by others that such a\ncell utilizing lead electrodes and\nsulfuric acid can attain an efficiency of\n6.16 percent , comparable to 10\npercent for the best thermoelectric\ngenerators currently used .\nThis work was done by J.

The matrix metal\nis independently selected for its\nstructural strength , resistance to wear\nor corrosion , or other characteristics .\nIn the process , a melt composed of\nthe composite components plus a\nsmall amount of dopant is solidified\nunder controlled conditions so that the\nliquid/solid boundary proceeds in only\none direction. The dopant breaks the\nboundary down in a cellular pattern,\nthereby alining the minor-component\nparticles in the major-component\nmatrix .\nFor aluminum-based alloys , a transition element such as iron , nickel , or\ncobalt is an effective dopant.

With the additive, slurries\ncan be stored for over 2 months\nwithout significant change in viscosity ,\nwhereas without the additive they\nbecome unacceptably thin in only 1\nday (see table) .\nThe ammonium hydroxide treatment was developed for glass-frit\nwater-base slurries that form hightemperature ceramic coatings for the\nSpace Shuttle . The treatment could\nbenefit other ceramic-coating slurries\n(continued on next page)\n\n509\n\nas well. Since treated slurries can be\nstored, frequent mixing of fresh\nbatches is unnecessary ; and , conceivably, less pure (and therefore less\nexpensive) materials could be used in\nthe slurry mix .\nThe glass-frit water-base slurry in\nthe Shuttle formulation contains an\norganic acrylate as a viscosity-control\nagent. I ron contamination in the frit\nreacts with ammonia ions in the\nacrylate (as do ions of other metallic\nelements) . When it is deprived of\n\nammonia , the acrylate becomes insoluble in the water base , and the\nslurry viscosity decreases . Even an\niron content of less than 0.02 percent\nof frit weight sharply lowers the slurry\nviscosity.\nThe addition of ammonium hydroxide to the mix gives the metal-ion\ncontaminants an alternative source of\nammonia.

Previous solutions of the\ndiffusion equations have generally\nbeen restricted to one geometry,\napplicable only to infinite or semiinfinite systems, or require that the\ndiffusion coefficient (D) be constant.\nThe finite-difference solutions developed for this package are applicable for planar, cylindrical, and\nspherical geometries with any diffusion-zone size and any continuous\nvariation of the diffusion coefficient\nwith concentration . Special techniques were Included to account for\ndifferences in molal volumes , initiation\nand growth of an intermediate phase ,\ndisappearance of a phase , and the\npresence of an initial composition\nprofile in the specimen . In each\nanalysis, an effort was made to\nachieve good accuracy while minimizing computation time .\n(continued on next page)\n511\n\nThe solutions to the diffusion equations for single-, two-, and threephase binary-alloy systems are calculated numerically by the three programs NAD1, NAD2, and NAD3 .\nNAD1 treats the diffusion between\npure metals or alloys that belong to a\nsingle-phase system . Diffusion in this\nsystem is described by a one-dimensional Fick\'s second law and will result\nin a continuous composition variation .\nFor computational purposes, Fick\'s\nsecond law is expressed as an explicit\nsecond-order finite-difference equation . Finite-difference calculations are\nmade by choosing the grid spacing\nsmall enough to give convergent\nsolutions of acceptable accuracy.\nNAD2 treats diffusion between pure\nmetals or alloys that form a two-phase\nsystem . Diffusion in the two-phase\nsystem is described by two partial\n\ndifferential equations (a Fick \'s second\nlaw for each phase) and an interfaceflux-balance equation that describes\nthe location of the interface . Actual\ninterface motion is obtained by a mass\nconservation procedure . To account\nfor changes in the thicknesses of the\ntwo phases as diffusion progresses, a\nvariable-grid technique developed by\nMurray and Landis is employed . These\nequations are expressed in finitedifference form and solved numerically.\nProgram NAD3 treats diffusion\nbetween pure metals or alloys that\nform a two-phase system with an\nintermediate third phase .

This\nrequirement is especially evident\nwhen handling highly infectious organisms or in critical biochemical\nstudies. A new indirect method for the\ndetection of microbial growth utilizes\nthe flow of charged particles across a\nbarrier that physically separates the\ngrowing cells from the electrodes and\nmeasures the resulting difference in\npotential between two platinum electrodes.\nConventional indirect methods include a microcalorimetric technique\nthat measures the amount of heat\ngenerated during cell growth, a chromatographic method that measures\nthe amounts and types of gases\nevolved during metabolism, -and a\nradiometric technique that measures\ntagged C02 evolved from the cellular\nbreakdown of tagged C14 glucose . All\nof these require sophisticated instrumentation and highly trained operators . Optical methods are also used to\nmeasure absorbed or reflected light,\nbut these techniques fail to differentiate between living and dead cells .\nTotal gas pressure can be measured\nwith pressure transducers, but the\nrequirement for a gastight system is a\nhandicap .\nIn the setup shown in Figure 1, two\narms of a parabiotic chamber are\nseparated by a sterile 0.22-/-tm membrane filter . This filter prevents microbial movement from the left arm to the\nright arm, but permits the movement\nof charged particles from the inoculated side to the uninoculated right arm .\nSterile nutrient broth was added to\nboth arms and the left arm inoculated\nwith bacteria : Escherichia coli and\nStaphylococcus aureus were used in\nthe tests. Two sterile platinum electrodes, with surface area ratios of 4:1,\nwere placed in the uninoculated right\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1979\n\nPARABIOTIC CHAMBER\n\nFigure 1. Parabiotic Chamber separates\nmicrobe-containing solution from electrolyte with a filter that passes charged\nparticles but not bacteria.

The parabiotic chamber was\nplaced in a 35\xc2\xb0 C incubator and the\nstrip-chart recorder activated.\nA typical strip-chart recording consists of a flat baseline followed by an\nincrease in voltage. The length of time\nbetween inoculation of the left arm\nand the increase in voltage in the\nun inoculated right arm is a function of\nthe number of cells added at zero\ntime. The dose response relationship\nfor E. coli is linear and is shown in\nFigure 2. Although similar responses\nwere noted for the Staphylococcus\naureus, which represents the other\nmajor group of bacteria, the grampositive organisms, they were weaker\nand not as consistent as with E. coli.\nIn a second experimental setup , the\nbottom portion of a petri dish was\ndrilled on opposite sides to accept two\nplatinum-wire electrodes that extended across the diameter of the dish.\nSterile 1.0 percent agar (without\nnutrients) was added to the dish and\nacted as the cell migration barrier.\n\nBacte,;a we,e added to nut,;.nt broth ~\n\n10\n\no\n\nPARABIOTIC CHAMBER\n\no AGAR\n\n9\n8\n\nE\n\n~\n\n7\n\nw\n\n~ 6\n...J\n\nm\n\n~ 5\no\n\n~4\n3\n2\n\no\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12\nDETECTION TIME (HOURS)\n\nFigure 2.

Since flawed\nregions are displaced relative to the\nrest of the material , the flaws are\nevident as changes in the fringe\npattern for the local regions around\nthe defective areas .\nTwo analytical problems can arise\nwhen quantifying the fringe motion :\nFirst, it is not always easy to\ndetermine which are unshifted ("nomotion") fringes after the load is\napplied ; and second , it Is sometimes\ndifficult to determine the direction of\nfringe motion. For example, it may be\nhard to ascertain whether a shifted\nfringe has moved a short distance to\nthe left or a longer distance from the\nright.\nIn a new approach to holographic\nnondestructive testing , three interference patterns are taken of the\nmaterial and superimposed : Two of\nthe patterns are the usual " before "\nand "after " images of conventional\ntesting , and the third pattern is taken\nby exposing the holographic plate\nwhile the load is building up to its final\nvalue . In addition , a variable phase\nshifter is placed in either of the arms\nof the laser interferometer, and\nselected phase shifts are introduced\nduring the exposures of the intermediate and final images. The exposure\ntime for the intermediate image is also\ncontrolled.\nA theoretical analysis shows that\nsignificant information can be extracted from the triple-exposure holographic image . For example, if a 180 0\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1979\n\n..\n~\n\nen\nz\nw\n\n....\nZ\nW\n(!)\n\nz\n\na:\n\nu. \xe2\x80\xa2\n\n-..\n\n.. .. \xe2\x80\xa2.... ..... ..... .. .....\n..... ... . .\nDISPLACEMENT\n\n..\n\n. ....\n,.\n\n..... .\n\nDISPLACEMENT\n\nThese Computer-Simulated Fringe Pattems show the results of triple-exposure\nholography with variable phase shift . In the pattern at the left , a 180\xc2\xb7 phase shift is\ninroduced when exposing the final image, and a long intermediate exposure time is\nused. The enhancement of the zero-order or " no-motion" fringe is apparent . The\nfigure at the right shows the effect of introducing a 90\xc2\xb7 phase shift . A\nrelatively-short intermediate exposure time is used here . Note that the fringe\namplitudes after zero-order increase in amplitude, indicating a " positive"\ndisplacement relative to a fixed axis . For a " negative" displacement , the fringe\namplitudes decrease.\n\nphase shift is introduced in one arm of\nthe interferometer when the last\npattern is taken , then the no-motion\nfringes in the composite will be\npreferentially enhanced (see figure ,\nleft) . If a 90 0 phase shift is introduced ,\nthen rather than being uniformly\nbright, the intensity of the fringes\ngradually changes in one direction or\nanother, depending on whether they\nare displaced to the left or to the right\n(see figure , right) . The first condition\nthus allows no-motion fringes to be\neasily identified, and the second\ncondition allows the direction of fringe\nshift to be identified . (The direction of\nshift is easily related to the direction of\nmovement of the material and thus to\nthe nature of the flaw .)\n\nThe new approach appears to be\nsuperior for locating flaws than simply\nsubtracting the after-load image from\nthat taken before the load is applied .\nAlthough the difference image should\nin principle isolate the flawed areas , it\nis usually complicated by slight misalinements between the before and\nafter patterns . Often, an image that is\njust as complicated as the original\nimages results .\nThis work was done by Hua-Kuang\nLiu of Lumin. Inc., for Marshall\nSpace Flight Center.

Resonant-Fatigue Cracking apparatus produces controlled surface cracks\nin test specimens .\n\nPerhaps the most-commonly-observed structural defect is the surface\ncrack . Fracture-control plans superimposed on modern structural design\ngenerally begin (and often conclude)\nwith an assessment of performance in\nthe presence of this type of flaw .\nFrequently these assessments are\nmade empirically, based on tests\nusing surface-cracked specimens that\nsimulate structural service . A low-cost\nresonant-fatiguing apparatus has been\ndeveloped that is useful in the production of surface cracks of controlled\nsize and shape in fracture specimens .\nThis apparatus has been used to\ndevelop fatigue cracks primarily in\nlarge (36 in. long) surface-crack\ntension test specimens .\nThe resonant-fatiguing apparatus\nconsists of a specially-designed standmounted clamping fixture , a commercially-available pneumatic actuator ,\nand su itable sound-control mufflers\n(Figure 1).\nOne end of a spec imen is securely\nfixed to the stand-mounted clamping\nfixture while the other (free) end of the\n\n522\n\nspecimen has the pneumatic actuator\nattached to it . The pneumatic actuator\ninduces movement in the free end of\nthe specimen .\nThe pneumatic actuator consists of\nan air-driven piston moving up and\ndown in a cylinder . The kinetic energy\nof the piston is transmitted to the\nspecimen and causes the specimen to\noscillate at a resonant frequency\ndetermined by the specimen material\nand design characteristics of the test\nspecimen/actuator combination . The\ndeflection or amplitude of the oscillations can be controlled by the air\npressure supplied to the actuator .\nFinal tuning of the system is\naccomplished by positioning of the\nactuator , the addition of weights , and\nexhaust air throttling . As the fatigue\ncrack grows , small changes in air\npressure are required to maintain\nconstant specimen deflection . Specimen deflection is eas ily monitored by\nuse of a simple handmade paper\ndeflection wedge , or gage , that is\ntaped to the osc illating end of the test\nspec imen.\n\n(e) APPEARANCE DURING OPERATION\n(TOTAL AMPLITUDE\nY3)\n\n=\n\nFigure 2.

The method, which\nuses a high-voltage spark discharge\nas a pulse source of sound, is based\nupon the fact that such a sound pulse\nhas a broadband spectral content and\nis capable of being analyzed by a\nfast Fourier-transform (FFT) digital\nprocessor.\nThe pulse of sound generated by the\nspark discharge passes across the\npressure transducer (Figure 1) and is\npartially reflected from the absorbent\nsurface. The transducer "sees" the\nincident and reflected pulses separated in time . Each pulse time history is\nfed into a dual-channel fast Fouriertransform (FFT) analyzer for computation of the transfer function at all\nfrequencies . The transfer function is\nthen used to compute the reflection\ncoefficient and acoustic impedance\ncoefficient as a function of frequency .\nFor the jet-nozzle situation (Figure\n2) the acoustic pulse passes through\nthe nozzle and is measured by a\nfar-field microphone . The transmission\ncoefficient for each polar angle , a, is\ncomputed from the transfer function\nbetween the far-field transmitted pulse\nand the incident in-duct pulse by using\nthe dual-channel FFT analyzer in the\nsame processing procedure as described for acoustic material evaluation .\nThe advantages of the impulse\nmethod over other methods are: (1)\ntest time is dramatically reduced since\none pulse covers the entire frequency\n(continued on next page)\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, Wlnter1979\n\nABSORBENT\nSURFACE\n\nMICROPHONE\n(PRESSURE\nTRANSDUCER)\n\nINCIDENT PLANE\xc2\xb7\nWAVE PULSE OF\nSOUND TRAVELING\nAT FREE\xc2\xb7SPACE\nSPEED\n\nFigure 1.

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nConventional tire-pressure measurement or monitoring always results\nin some air-pressure loss when a gage\nor similar instrument is inserted into\nthe tire valve . This problem could be\neliminated by measuring the pressure\nat the tire surface with an external\npressure gage .\nThe proposed measurement would\nbe made with a device (see figure)\nthat includes two pads that contact the\ntwo opposite tire walls . One pad\nmoves on a threaded rod to adjust the\nunit for the tire width. The other pad is\nconnected to the measuring instrument ; e. g ., pressu re gage , load cell,\nor strain gage . With the device in\nplace around the tire , an external load\nis applied to that pad until the tire wall\ndeflects . At that point , the externally\napplied pressure is approximately\nequal to the internal tire pressure and\nis measured directly .\nSince the measurement would be\nsensitive to such factors as the tire\nsize , design (e.g., radial , belted), and\nmaterial, a calibration curve of tire\npressure versus gage pressure at\ndeflection would first be obtained on\nan equivalent tire before the concept\nis used to make pressure measurements on a field-installed tire. In\naddition, some laboratory work would\nhave to be done to determine the\nreproducibil ity of the calibration curve\namong ti res of the same type and to\nascertain the effects of such factors\nas the hardness of the tire-wall\nmaterial and the location relative to\nthe wheel rim or tread area .\nSuch a device might be used\nonboard ai rcraft for monitoring pressure during the wheel well storage . It\ncould be easily removed during\n\n524\n\nOPTIONAL ADJUSTMENT\n(NOT REQUIRED FOR IN-VEHICLE USAGE)\n\n-.....~~\n\n++++-I-it--\n\nTURNBUCKLE,\nSIMILAR TO BOW\nCOMPASS\n\nThis External Tire-Pressure Measuring Concept involves a device that applies\nexternal load to the tire wall to measure its internal pressure. Two pads grip the\nopposite tire walls . In the version shown, load is applied to the pad on the right by\nan air pump equipped with a pressure gage. Alternately, the load can be applied\nusing load cells , strain gages, and the like. As the tire deflects, the equilibrium point\nis reached where the internal tire pressure is equal to the measured external load .\nThe device prevents air leakage that occurs when pressure is measured through the\ntire valve.\n\nlanding-gear extension . The method\npromises to be faster than conventional tire-pressure checks, speeding\nup the turnaround time for aircraft.\nThe device can also be used to\nmeasure tire pressures on land\nvehicles .\n\nThis work was done by Lloyd O.\nAshmore of Rockwell International\nCorp. for Johnson Space Center.\nNo further documentation is available .\nMSC-18490\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1979\n\nSynthetic Seawater as Stress-Corrosion Test Medium\nSeawater minimizes pitting corrosion\nof aluminum-alloy test samples.\n\nMarshall Space Flight Center, Alabama\nStress-corrosion-cracking\n(SCC)\nresistance of aluminum alloys and of\nother metals is determined by an\naccelerated method of alternately\nimmersing the strained test specimens\nin a 3.5-percent saltwater solution . A\nproblem with this procedure is that the\nsaltwater accelerates pitting corrosion\nof aluminum alloys containing copper ,\nmaking it difficult to evaluate the tests .\nA new approach is to use synthetic\nseawater to minimize the pitting\ncorrosion .\nOf the three corrosion-inhibiting\nmethods evaluated using (a) chromate\ninhibitors in the saltwater , (b) surface\ntreating the samples via anodizing or\nalodine treatment , and (c) synthetic\nseawater , synthetic seawater was\nfound to be the most effective test\nmedium. Synthetic seawater is prepared according to the formulation\ns~wn in the table . It is more uniform\nthan fresh seawater; the latter may be\ndiluted or contaminated and would be\ndifficult to transport to inland laboratories .\nThe illustration compares pitting\ncorrosion of aluminum samples immersed in saltwater and prepared\nseawater. For example , loss in tensile\nstrength of unstressed T351 specimens immersed in saltwater ranged\nfrom 35 percent in 15 days to 90\npercent in 90 days , while the strength\nloss in seawater was only 15 percent\nin 90 days . In many cases the losses\nin saltwater exceeded 25 percent after\n15 days and 25 percent after 30 days .\nIn seawater the losses did not exceed\n20 percent after 90 days except for the\n2014-T6 alloy .\nThis work was done by T.

However; jet-noise sources are\nin motion and the noise undergoes\nlarge Doppler shifts, resulting in\n\nnegligible coherence over widely\nseparated directions . Thus the crosscorrelation of sound pressures between wide angle essentially represents the autocorrelation of core noise\nradiated to the far field.\nIf the microphones are located on\nan arc of a circle in the far field , the\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1979\n\nmaximums of all correlations occur at\ntime, T\nO. There are symmetric\nautocorreations for each angle, and\nthe cross-correlation is symmetric\nbecause it represents an autocorrelation (the core noise in this case). In\ngeneral , if the jet noise contribution is\nnot negligible, the cross-correlation\nmay be made symmetric about T = O.\nSuch a procedure will remove any\nresidual contribution from jet noise,\nwhich at large angular separations is\nessentially asymmetric about T\nO.\nExperiments have been performed\n\n=\n\n=\n\nin which nitrogen gas at ambient\ntemperature flowed at several jet\nvelocities through a nozzle . Internal\nturbulence and noise were present in\nthe plenum because of abrupt\nchanges rn the flow directions at the\nentrance. Noise data measured by a\nrectangular array of eight microphones in the far field were recorded\nand processed.\nThe results confirmed that core\nnoise and jet noise can be separated\nby examining the cross-correlation of\nfar-field microphone signals and that\n\nthe crossover point between core\nnoise and jet noise moves toward\nhigher velocities at higher angles with\nrespect to the jet axis . The method\ncan be extended to separate the\nspectral components and to determine\nthe effects of a surrounding flow\nsimulating forward motion .\nThis work was done by Shakkottai P.\nParthasarathy of Caltech for NASA\'s\nJet Propulsion Laboratory.

The solenoid core in\nthis version is cobalt.\nThe transducer in Figure 2 has two\nwindings : Winding B carries direct\ncurrent , which creates a magnetic\nbias in the cobalt core .

Conventional practice is to\nobtain these measurements with calipers if the entire diameter is accessible or by the use of templates, optical\ncomparators , or similar devices where\nonly a smaller segment is accessible .\nThese methods cannot be used ,\nhowever, if a full diametrical section of\nthe material is not accessible for\ncaliper measurement or if the size,\ncondition, or maneuverability of the\ncylinder is not amenable to the use of\ntemplate or comparator-type devices .\nA simple method has been developed\nby which either the inside or outside\nradius of a cylindrical segment may be\naccu rately determined in these situations . This method employs a\nstandard micrometer or depth gage\nwith a ball-end rod and a fixed-length\nbaseplate .\nThe procedure for measuring an\ninside radius is shown in Figure 1. The\ndepth gage is placed on top of a rigid\n\n536\n\nDIAL GAGE (OR\nDEPTH MICROMETER)\n\nVERTICAL\nEND\nPLATE(S)\n\n1----- l - - - - I\nCYLINDER\nSEGMENT\n\nFigure 1. Inside Radius of a cylindrical\nsegment is determined using a baseplate of known length and measuring\nthe perpendicular distance from the\ncenter of the plate to the inside surface\nof the cylinder.\n\nFigure 2. Outside Radius of a cylindrical segment is obtained using a baseplate with two identical vertical end\nplates separated by a known distance\nand measuring the distance h shown\nabove .\n\nbaseplate of known length L with the\nrod extending through a central hole in\nthe plate . The ends of the plate rest on\nthe inside wall of the cylinder, and the\nlength of the baseplate (L) becomes a\nchord of the circle with a radius that is\n\nthe same as the inside radius of the\ncylinder. The ends of the plate , being\nparallel , are readily alined with the\nlongitudinal axis of the cylindrical\nsegment. The depth gage is used in\nthe conventional manner to measure\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1979\n\nthe distance h between the baseplate\nand the cylinder wall . The inside\nradius of the cylinder (AI) is then\ncalculated by the formula\nA _ L2 + 4h2\nI 8h\nOutside radii can be determined by\nthe same general method . Vertical\nend plates fastened securely to the\nbaseplate allow it to span a convex\nsurface , as shown in Figure 2. The\n\npoints of contact of the end plates on\nthe convex surface constitute the fixed\nL dimension of the formula for\ndetermining the radius . The h\ndimension is obtained by subtracting\nthe depth reading obtained with the\ndevice resting on the convex surface\nfrom the zero-depth indication obtained by calibrating the device on a\nflat surface .\nThe new method is more adaptable\nin a variety of situations than are\nexisting methods , and measurements\n\ncan be obtained under conditions that\nmay be difficult if not impossible using\nother methods . For example , this\nmethod could be used to measure\naccurately the radii of partiallyexposed buried pipelines , or of pipes\nand ducts , in hazardous environments\nwhere manipulators must be used to\nhandle tools .\nThis work was done by R. J.\nBuzzard of Lewis Research Center.\nNo further documentation is available .\nLEW-12826\n\ncritical bandwidths for loudness,\nalthough the program applies for any\nbandwidth .\n[One-octave-bandwidth\nmeasurements of broadband sounds\nhave yielded calculated loudness\nlevels up to 2 phons greater than those\nobtained from calculations using onethird-octave data (which generally\nexceed critical bandwidths) .] In the\ncase of tones less than 10Hz apart ,\nwhich produce audible beats, it is\nnecessary to specify the initial phases\nof the frequency components and the\ntime following an initial time because\nthe loudness of these steady sounds is\nphase and time dependent.\nThe operational theory from which\nthe present loudness calculation procedure is derived takes into account\nthe transmission characteristics of the\nauditory system, a squaring operation\nthat occurs in the mechanical-toelectrical transduction in the inner\near, a channeling process (associated\nwith critical bands for loudness) ,\nfrequency interactions that result\nbecause neuron bandwidths exceed\nchannel bandwidths , half-wave rectification in the auditory nerve, and the\nauditory integration time .\nAmong psychoacoustic phenomena\naccounted for by the theory are\naudible beats , the audibility of sounds\nconsisting of sublim inal components ,\ncritical bands for loudness , periodicity\npitch , and pitch of the residue .

Many of the larger\ngeneral-purpose\nprograms\nwere\n(continued on next page)\n537\n\n~\n\noriginally\nfor\nlinear\ndeveloped\nstructures and subsequently were\nextended to include a nonlinear\ncapability .\nThe AGGIE I program is a moderately-sized finite-element program\nthat was developed specifically for\nnonlinear structural analysis . It is\nbased on two- and three-dimensional\nisoparametric solid elements . AGGIE I\naccounts for nonlinearities due to\nlarge displacements , large strains,\nand nonlinear material behavior.\nMaterial models incorporated include\nlinear elastic, nonlinear elastic, orthotropic , nonlinear elastic incompressible , and elastic plastic .\nBoth static and dynamic response\npredictions are possible. A displacement incrementation capability is\nincluded to predict buckling and postbuckling response . Provisions are\nincluded for both conservative and\nnonconservative\n(deformation-dependent) loadings . Dynamic dimensioning allows efficient use of available\nhigh-speed memory . Problem and\navailable-memory sizes are used to\nselect either the in-core or out-of-core\nequation solver .\nAGGI E I solves a set of linearized\nincremental equilibrium equations for\neach time step or load step . To ensure\nthat equilibrium is being satisfied at\neach step , a modified NewtonRaphson method is used to perform\nthe equilibrium iteration . During the\niterative process , the tangent-stiffness\nmatrix is updated periodically when\nconvergence deteriorates ; alternately,\nthe matrix may be updated at a userspecified frequency. In dynamic\nanalyses , a time integration procedure\nis invoked using either the Wilson or\nNewmark method .\nAll elements and most material\nmodels used in AGGIE I are based on\na total Lagrangian formulation. Several material models using the updated\nLagrangian solution are also available .\nElements currently available include a\nthree-dimensional truss element, a\ntwo-dimensional isoparametric solid\nelement with 4 to 8 nodes , and a\nthree-dimensional isoparametric solid\nelement with 8 to 21 nodes . The twodimensional element is reducible to a\nconstant-strain triangular element ,\nand the three-dimensional element is\n\n538\n\nreducible to a constant-strain tetrahedron .

The axial\nbending stresses must balance the\ninternal loads when strains are converted to stresses and integrated over\nthe cross section . A neutral axis shift\nmay be required to achieve this\nbalance . Some elements of the\nstructure may be loaded beyond their\nbuckling capacity , limiting the stresscarry capabilities of those elements\nand further redistributing loads on the\ncross section .\nA user may compute the crosssectional load balance using either a\nRamberg-Osgood stress-strain relationship or a " perfectly plastic "\n\nrelationship . The load moment is\nbalanced by iteration at each cross\nsection in the structure .\nInput data include structure description , cross-section data , material\nproperties , mechanical loads , and\ntemperature data . Outputs include a\ndescription of the user-defined structure, a description of the automatically-determined cutback structure\nand redundants , the redundant values\nand internal loads for each iteration ,\nand for each cross section , a detailed\nlook at stresses and strains for the\nfinal moment axial-load distritution .\nThis program is written in FORTRAN\nIV for batch execution and has been\nimplemented on a CDC CYBER\n70-series computer with a central\nmemory requirement of approximately\n110K (octal) of 60-bit words .

Although this concept\nwas originally proposed nearly 40\nyears ago , prospective new applications of the jet-flap principle to\nV/STOL aircraft and helicopter rotors\nhave raised a demand for a better\nunderstanding of the jet-flap wing . A\ncomputer program has now been\ndeveloped to help analyze the performance of jet-flap wings .\nA fast and easy-to-use prediction\ntechnique , it generates accurate solutions for a wide range of wing\ngeometries and trailing-edge jet momentum distributions . The analysis is\nbased on an optimized vortex-lattice\napproach and has been shown to\nresult in the rapid convergence of both\nthe overall and distributed loadings .\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1979\n\nThis generalized approach allows\ntreatment of swept tapered-wing planforms with nonuniform part-span\nblowing.\nThe vortex-lattice method for the\nanalysis of lifting-surface aerodynamics has become a widely used\ntechnique during the past decade . It\ncan be readily applied to configurations having complex geometries .\nRelatively simple mathematics are\nused for computation . and no special\na priori loading-function assumptions\nare needed .\nThe analysis considers the steady.\nsubsonic flow of an inviscid fluid over\na thin jet-flap wing . The problem is\ntreated within the framework of\nlinearized lifting-surface theory . A\nswept tapered-wing planform is considered . with the wing root chord\nnormalized to unity . Consistent with\nthin-wing theory. it is assumed that the\nthickness of the trailing jet is zero ;\nhowever. the jet is assumed to have a\nfinite distribution of momentum flux in\nthe span direction and to support a\ndiscontinuity of pressure . It is further\nassumed that the momentum flux is\nconstant along the jet in each plane of\nthe stream direction .\nThe entire lifting surface, the wing\nplus the jet, is subdivided into a\nnumber of lattices with a swept horseshoe vortex of initially unknown\nstrength located in each . The bound\nportion of the vortex is placed along\nthe individual lattice quarter chord\nwith the trailing vortex legs extending\nto downstream infinity. To solve for the\nunknown vortex strengths . the total\nupwash induced by all the horseshoe\nvortexes is evaluated at each control\npoint and is used to satisfy the\nboundary conditions . 80th the overall\nand distributed aerodynamic loadings\non the jet-flap system can then\nbe calculated in a straightforward\nmanner.\nThese loadings consist of both a\ncirculation component. which includes\nthe usual circulation due to camber\nand angle of attack as well as the\ninduced " supercirculation " arising\nfrom the jet. and a jet reaction\ncomponent, which is equivalent to the\nintegrated contribution of the jet from\nthe trailing-edge to downstream infin-\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1979\n\nity. The total lift coefficient. total\npitching-moment coefficient . and the\nmean aerodynamic chord are calculated . Finally. the induced drag\ncoefficient from the wing circulation\ncan be evaluated .\nThe computer program is written in\nFORTRAN IV for batch execution and\nhas been implemented on a CDC\n6000-series computer with a central\nmemory requirement of approximately\n40K (octal) of 60-bit words .

The development of\nprofile shapes capable of efficient\noperation in the transonic regime has\nspurred interest in aircraft designed\nspecifically to operate at near-sonic\nspeeds or efficiently at high-subsonic\nspeeds . The ability to predict accurately the aerodynamic characteristics\nof the complete three-dimensional\nwing would allow many detailed tradeoff studies to be performed without\nrecourse to wind-tunnel testing of\nevery design variation .\nFLO-22 uses a relaxation method to\nsolve a finite-difference approximation\nof the full-potential equation for the\ntransonic flow past a configuration\nconsisting of a wing of arbitrary\nplanform and dihedral extending from\na symmetry plane or wall. Comparisons of FLO-22 calculated results with\n\nexperimental data for both conventional and supercritical transport\n.wings....bave shown good agreement.\nThe finite-difference approximation\nfor the full-potential equation used in\nFLO-22 is the rotated-difference\nscheme introduced by Jameson. In\nthe FLO-22 program . the flow is\nanalyzed in coordinate planes parallel\nto the free-stream velocity vector with\nsymmetry conditions applied on a\nsingle coordinate surface. The spandirection coordinate lines are alined\nwith the wing leading edge to allow the\nuse of a fine mesh in that sensitive\nregion . For wings of appreciable\nsweep the coordinate system used\nbecomes highly nonorthogonal . but it\nallows accurate representation of the\nfinite-difference boundary conditions .\nIn the absence of strong shock\nwaves, the steady. inviscid motion of a\ncompressible fluid is accurately approximated by the standard equation\nfor the velocity potential . The relaxation scheme used to solve the finitedifference equations simulates an\nartificial time-dependent process that\nconverges to the desired solution of\nthe steady-state equation. At each\niteration step . the three-dimensional\nsolution is obtained by solving the\nequations in streamwise planes by\nusing a successive-line overrelaxation\nalgorithm . To speed convergence .\ncalculations can be performed on\nsucceedingly finer grids by using\ninterpolations of the proceeding solution as initial values .\nThis program is written in FORTRAN\nIV for batch execution and has been\nimplemented on a CDC 6000-series\nmachine with a central memory\nrequirement of approximately 145K\n(octal) of 60-bit words .

The\nTRANDES program provides the aircraft engineer with an accurate and\nefficient tool for the analysis of steady,\nirrotational, transonic flow over a\nspecified two-dimensional airfoil in\nfree air. The program can also be used\nto design airfoils having a prescribed\npressure distribution, including the\neffects of weak viscous interaction.\nThe inviscid flow field is calculated\nby solving the full, inviscid, perturbation-potential flow equation on a\nCartesian grid, which is usually alined\nrelative to the airfoil chord line.\nEfficiency of the method is improved\nby stretching the coordinate plane so\nthat the infinite physical plane is\nmapped into a finite computation\nplane . In this manner, boundary\nconditions at infinity can be applied\ndirectly. TRANDES has been found to\nyield accurate solutions efficiently for\nbiconvex, conventional, and aftcambered airfoils.\nTRAN DES replaces the governing\nsecond-order partial differential equation with a nonconservative system of\nfinite-difference equations. A form of\nJameson\'s rotated difference scheme\nis included at supersonic points . The\ndifference equations are solved using\na column-relaxation scheme . In order\nto obtain rapid convergence, it is best\nto apply the scheme on several\ndifferent grids . In the analysis case ,\nthe difference equation is first solved\non a very coarse grid . The grid is\niteratively reduced using interpolated\nvalues from preceding grids as initial\nconditions .\nIn the inverse case , used for airfoil\ndesign and modification, the initial\nshape of the airfoil must be assumed\nfor the specified pressure distribution .\nThe initially assumed shape is not\ncritical because of the rapid convergence properties of the iterative\n\n540\n\ncolumn-relaxation scheme used . After\nthe design solution is obtained, the\nresultant shape is treated as a\ndisplacement surface so that the\ndisplacement thickness is subtracted\nto obtain the actual airfoil surface . The\nboundary layer characteristics are\ndetermined\nusing\nthe\nNashMacdonald method with smoothing .\nThe program can include the effects of\nboundary layer interaction, but no\ncorrection is included for the effects of\nwake curvature ; and an empirical\napproach is incorporated in the\ntrailing-edge region.\nThis program is written in FORTRAN\nIV and has been implemented on a\nCDC CYBER 175 with a central\nmemory requirement of approximately\n111 K (octal) of 60-bit words .\nTRANDES was developed in 1977.\nThis program was written by Leland\n\nA.

The\nuse of a sling can add capacity and\nflexibility to the transport prospects of\na helicopter , but it also seriously\nimpairs the handling characteristics of\nthe craft. Several ideas have been\nintroduced to improve the handling\ncharacteristics of a sling-loaded helicopter : con,trol jets at the load, a\nmovable cable-attachment point on\nthe helicopter, and a cable-angle\nfeedback into the helicopter stability\naugmentation system .\nThe computer program developed\nto test these and other ideas helps to\ncircumvent expensive prototyping and\nfield testing . Comparisons between (1)\ncomputed data and flight data , (2)\nsimulation-system values and flighttest data, and (3) pilot evaluations of\nsimulation and actual-flight cond itions\nhave been very favorable .\n\nThe overall mathematical model\nused in the program consists of\nnumerous submodules that describe\nvarious components of the total\ndynamic system . The atmospheric\nmodel has variable air density, winds\nwith variable magnitude and direction,\nand variable-intensity turbulence . The\nhelicopter control-system model converts the pilot\'s cyclic-control-stick,\ncollective-stick, and pedal inputs into\nmain- and tail-rotor cyclic and collective-pitch data. Nonlinear models for\nthe main and tail rotors define thrust,\ndrag , and side forces as well as hub\nand force moments representative of\narticulated rotors over a wide range of\nairspeeds.\nThe rotor models account for\nvariable inflow velocity, variable rotor\nspeed , blade twist , tip loss, blade\nconing, blade flapping, actuator dynamics, flapping-hinge offset, and\ntail-rotor flapping-hinge cant angle.\nThe automatic flight-control system\nmodel is based on the syste m used by\nthe U.S. Army CH-54 helicopter. The\nfuselage aerodynamics model defines\nnonlinear lift, drag, and side forces as\nwell as pitching, rolling, and yawing\nmoments in terms of a wide range of\nangle of attack, sideslip, rotor downwash, body angular rates , and dynamic pressure .\nA similar aerodynamic model is\nused for the external load . The loadsuspension model defines cable tension in one or more cables and the\nresulting forces and moments acting\non the helicopter and the external\nload . To approximate the forces and\nmoments acting on the load during\npickup and landing, a ground-contact\nmodel is included .\nA general set of nonlinear , rigidbody, equations of motion for both the\nhelicopter and external load determines the motion of each body with\nrespect to a flat , nonrotating Earth . A\nwell-tested algorithm determines the\ntrimmed helicopter-control positions ,\nhelicopter attitude , and load position\nand attitude .

The high aerodynamic\nefficiency of wings with a large aspect\nratio depends directly on the presence\nof leading-edge thrust to counteract\nthe drag arising from pressure forces\nacting on the remainder of the airfoil.\nNumerous techniques are available\nfor predicting leading-edge thrust at\nsubsonic speeds . Leading-edge thrust\nplays a reduced role at supersonic\nspeeds . However, accurate thrust\npredictions are still considered very\nimportant in the analysis of wings at\nsupersonic speeds . For low supersonic speeds and for wings with wellrounded leading edges, an appreciable amount of leading-edge thrust may\nbe developed . Furthermore, these\neffects can appear with flow reattachment in an associated phenomenon ,\nthe formation of leading-edge vortex\nflow . A computer program was developed to predict the leading-edge thrust\nfor wings of arbitrary planform at\nsupersonic speeds .\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1979\n\nThe methods used in the program\nare based on linearized wing theory.\nThe magnitude of the leading-edge\nthrust developed by a thin lifting wing\nis dependent on the upwash just ahead\nof the leading edge and on the airfoil\ncamber surface just behind the leading edge . The influence of both of\nthese factors is reflected in the\npressure distribution in the vicinity of\nthe leading edge . The program first\ncalculates the lifting pressures , lift\ncoefficients, drag coefficients, moment coefficients, and lift distributions\nby using an aft-element sensing\ntechnique . Next, an empirical function\nis used to calculate a set of adjusted\npressure-coefficient locations along\nthe leading edge . This information is\nthen used to determine the limiting\nvalue of the singularity parameter and\nfrom this, the value of the local\nleading-edge thrust coefficient. The\nleading-edge thrust coefficient and\ndistribution are calculated on a flatplate as well as a cambered and\ntwisted wing for the arbitrary planform\nthat was specified.\nThis program is written in FORTRAN\nV for batch execution and has been\nimplemented on a CDC CYBER \'175\nwith a central memory requirement of\napproximately 74K (octal) of 50-bit\nwords .

Hiltop I evaluates electric\npropulsion systems and may, in the\nhands of a skilled analyst , efficiently\nsimulate a wide variety of interplanetary missions . It uses numerical\nintegration of the two-body , threedimensional equations of motion and\nthe Euler-Lagrange equations . It contains transversality conditions that\n\npermit the rapid generation of converged maximum-payload trajectory\ndata and allows the optimization of\nnumerous other performance indices\nfor which no transversality conditions\nare included .\nIn addition to optimizing the thrust\ndirection and on/off switch times,\nother significant performance parameters that can be optimized are jetexhaust speed , power level, hyperbolic\nexcess\nspeeds ,\nlaunchasymptote geocentric declination,\nflight time , and launch date . The\nability to simulate constrained optimum solutions , including trajectories\nhaving specified propulsion time and\nconstant-thrust cone angle, are also\navailable. Performance requirements\nfor a variety of launch vehicles may be\ndetermined .\nHiltop I may simulate missions\nhaving as many as four targets\n(celestial objects) along a trajectory.\nVarious types of encounter such as\nrendezvous, stopover, orbital captu re ,\nand flyby can be accommodated . One\ntarget is designated as the " primary "\ntarget (which may be absent in such\nmissions as , for example , extraecliptic probes) . In addition, up to\nthree " intermediate" targets are permissible , such that the intermediate\ntargets are visited prior to the primary\ntarget. At present , intermediate targets must be relatively massless\nobjects such as comets and asteroids ,\nbecause the gravitational perturbing\neffect of an intermediate target on the\nspacecraft is not coded into the\nprogram . In addition , the spacecraft is\noptionally permitted to swing by the\nprimary target and continue onward\nballistically to up to five " postswingby" targets .\nHiltop II is a more realistic propulsion-system model involving the actual\nion beam current and voltage of the\nthruster . The power processor efficienty , ion thruster efficiency, and\nthruster specific impulse are modeled\nas variable functions of the power\n(solar, nuclear , or other) available to\nthe propulsion system . The number of\noperating thrusters are staged , and\nthe beam voltage is selected from a\nset of five (or less) constant Voltages .\nThe minimum and maximum numbers\nof operating thrusters , the minimum\nthrottling ratio , and the maximum\ninput power to an individual thruster\n(continued on next page)\n\n541\n\n0\n\nare specified as input data .

A similar design could be used\nin the study of sea ice and in other\nsurface-penetration studies .\nThe projectile forebody (see figure)\nincludes a ballistic casing with a\nplastic drag funnel mounted over the\nrear opening. The cable is coiled in a\nsingle layer on a cylindrical spool\nwithin the casing . There is a slight gap\nbetween the cable and the inner wall\nof the casing, which allows the cable\nto feed along the wall and out of the\nhole in the center of the funnel. The\ninterior of the funnel and a portion of\nthe spool cavity are filled with a lowdensity, cellular-plastic plug that sandwiches the cable between the plug and\nthe inner wall of the funnel. The end\nsurface of the spool and inner surface\nof the funnel at its opening are curved\nto permit smooth acceleration and\nreduce bending stresses and to\nreduce wear on the cable as it is\ndeployed. The cable is made of a hightensile-strength\n(200,000\npsi)\nberyllium/copper alloy with good\nelongation and low electrical resistance . A tough , lightweight, coating\n(similar to enamel) insulates the wire .\nThe afterbody contains a funnel with\na flexible, stepped-diameter, strain\nrelief that protects the cable at the\npoint of greatest flexing . The cable\npasses through the strain relief, and\nthe space between the cable and\nstrain relief is filled with an adhesive.\nThe forebody is joined to the\nafterbody with a light friction fit.\nAlternate methods of attachment\nmight include detents or shearpins .\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1979\n\nPLASTIC\nPLUG\n\nThe Cable Deployment is shown at rest and as the cable is being deployed . The\nplastic plug and the funnels in the forebody and afterbody absorb the cable\nrotational energy . Otherwise, the energy could rupture the cable .\n\nThe forebody can be separated from\n1he afterbody by a rocket , or they can\nbe fired as a unit at a target that stops\nthe afterbody on impact (the forebody\nwould continue, deploying the cable) .\nAs the forebody moves away from\nthe afterbody, the cable unwinds and\ncuts and grinds a passageway in the\nplastic plug . The plug and funnel thus\nallow the cable to yield its rotational\nenergy to friction . (The afterbody\nfunnel has the same effect.)\nThe prototype was fi red at 150 m / s\nat an aperture in a plywood/aluminum\ntarget. The target stripped the afterbody off the forebody with a deceleration of 20,000 g\'s ; the forebody\n\ncontinued until it was stopped in a\nplastic- and particle-board-filled box.\nThe cable survived the 20 ,OOO-g\ndeployment .\nThis work was done by Christopher\nE.

A valve\nwas needed that could be operated by\ncomputer command to connect alternately the pressure transducers to\nknown sources of pressure for calibrating purposes. It had to withstand\npressures up to 600 psi , (4 .2X 106\nN/m2) ; commercially available valves\nused for this purpose withstand\npressures of only 300 psi (2.1 x 106\nN/m 2 ).\nThe valve, shown in Figure 1,\nconsists of a small geared reversible\nmotor, operated by a momentary\ncontact closure , which drives a shaft\nwith a-rings placed to seal selected\nports . The shaft rotates and also\nmoves axially, causing the ports to be\nalternately connected and disconnected . Electrical control of the valve\nis provided by limit switches and\nrelays as shown in Figure 2.\nThe valve can be made in variou~\nconfigurations, such as 6-pole double\nthrow, 12-pole single throw, etc . The\nvalve can connect a common port to\nanyone of many instrument transducers .\nThe new instrument valve design\nhas a number of advantages over\nother available valves . Less precision\nmachining of parts is required ; therefore the machining operations are less\nexpensive . Seals are made with\nO-rings, which are easily replaceable\nand inexpensive; and the valve uses\nless power.\nThis instrument valve can be used in\nany application requiring pilot valves\nfor control devices .\nThis work was done by Herbert L.\nMinkin of Lewis Research Center.

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nA circular seal both slides and\nflexes to accommodate relative motion between two sealed members .\nOriginally developed for the Space\nShuttle orbiter (see figure). it contains\na sliding seal to accommodate engine\ngimbaling and a flexible seal that\nabsorbs the forward motion at high\nthrust of the engine heat shield relative\nto the ai rframe. Other possible applications are in the support structures of\nheavy machinery and vehicle engines .\nThe seal can withstand temperatures up to 1,600 0 F (871 0 C) while\nsealing against moderate positive\n(crush) and negative (burst) pressures . It vents the interior to the\nexterior at a crush pressure difference\nof 1.32 psi (9,100 N/m 2) and a burst\npressure difference of 2.65 psi\n(18 ,200 N/m 2).\nThe sliding seal consists of a\nsilicone-rubber wiper coated with\nPTFE and a series of electrodepositednickel-on-graphite slider blocks. Fortyeight spring cans in a retainer ring\nexert pressure on the graphite block\nso that they slide and seal against the\nspherical surface of the engine heat\nshield . The retainer ring is held in\nposition by four articulated links\nanchored to the airframe heat shield.\nThe links allow the sliding seal to\nfollow the forward movement of the\nengine heat shield as the engine thrust\nbuilds up .\nThe flexible seal cons ists of an\noutside layer of silica-fiber fabric , a\nlayer of thermal insulation , a layer of\nglass-fiber fabric for pressure sealing\nand structural support , a polyim ide\nfilm for a pressure-seal backup , and\niron/nickel-alloy mesh for lightning\nprotection . The layers are sewn\ntogether with quartz thread. Since the\nseal flexes only slightly as the\npressure differential changes from\npositive to negative , the layers are not\nsubjected to wrinkling or shape reversals and therefore last longer .\nThe seal can be removed with\nrelative ease so that the engine can be\ninspected or replaced .

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nAn improved table-saw guard , as\nshown , is held by a side support frame\nwith a counterbalanced linkage that\nreduces the weight of the guard on the\npart being cut and permits easier\noperation . Slotting cuts can be made\nthat are not possible with conventional\nguards supported by struts through the\nsaw slot.\nThe guard is a transparent plastic\nenclosure held by a side-attached\noverhead support arm . The vertical\nsection of the arm can be unclamped\nto rotate the guard off the table . The\narm is combined with an adjustablecounterweight guard linkage to reduce\nthe downward force holding the guard\non the sliding material being cut . The\ncounterweight adjustment is limited so\nthe guard will always have adequate\ndownward movement.\nThe lighter contact of the counterbalanced guard on the material being\nsawed reduces damage to foam and\nother fragile materials . This has been\nverified by successfully cutting fragile\nSpace Shuttle exterior insulation . In\naddition, cuts are better controlled\nthan on saws with conventional\nguards, making it possible to produce\nslot and step cuts . Thick materials are\neasily pushed under the guard with\nreduced force .\nPossible\nmodifications\ninclude\nbuilding an electrical interlock so that\nthe saw will not operate with the guard\nout of position . Presently, the vertical\npost is kept clamped in position until\nthe interlock is developed . Another\nfeature that could be added is\n" kickback" control.\nThis work was done by Benjamin R.\n\nThis Counterbalanced Table-Saw Guard makes a lighter contact on materials being\nsawed. The cuts are better controlled, and damages to fragile foam-type materials\nare reduced .

The\nprevious assembly method consisted\nof heating the entire bearing, chilling\nthe shaft so that it contracted and\ncould be slipped into the heatexpanded bearing, and drying the\nshaft/bearing assembly in a vacuum\noven . This procedure was unsatisfactory because it caused corrosion in\nabout 40 percent of the assemblies .\nThe new method eliminates the\ncooling and vacuum-drying steps.\nOnry the bearing inner-race halves are\nheated [to about 300 0 F (150 0 C)) .\nFirst , the outer race, balls, and cage\nare placed on a special handling\nsleeve (see figure) . The inboard half of\nthe hot inner race is slipped on the\nshaft (which is at ambient temperature) and allowed to cool. The outer\nrace, balls, and cage are then rolled\noff of the handling sleeve and nested\nin the bearing support. Finally, the hot\noutboard half of the inner race is\ninserted.\nThe key to the new method is the\nhandling sleeve . Its outside diameter\nis sized to retain the balls, cage, and\nouter race as a unit, without danger of\nthe balls falling out of place . At the\nsame time, the inside diameter is\nsized for easy insertion on the shaft.\nThe method can simplify bearing\ninstallation if :\n- the race is in two pieces and is designed for an interference fit on the\nshaft,\n- the outer race can be held by a looseto-light press fit at the time of\nassembly, and\n- the balls are held in position by a\ncage.\nBesides eliminating corrosion and\nspeeding up assembly, the procedure\nsaves energy because it requires no\nliquid nitrogen for cooling the shaft\n\n552\n\nSHAFT\n\nOUTER\nRACE\n\nSTEP 1\n\nSTEP 2\n\nHANDLING\nSLEEVE\n\nSTEP 3\n\nSTEP 4\n\nInstalling a Thrust Bearing on a shaft (shown here in half cross section) requires four\nsteps: (1) The outer race and ball subassembly are placed on a special handling\nsleeve, (2) the hot inner race (inboard half) is placed on the shaft , (3) the\nsubassembly is rolled off the sleeve into the bearing support , and (4) the hot inner\nrace (outboard half) is placed on the shaft .\n\nand no natural gas or electric power\nfor operating the vacuum oven .\nThis work was done by Norman D.\nSensenbaugh of Rockwell International Corp. for Marshall Space\nFlight Center.

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nMechanical stress on solder joints is\nreduced by a procedure for soldering\nelectronic components to circuit\nboards . The procedure was developed\nfor radio-frequency (RF) strip-line\ncircuits , for which dimensions must be\ncarefully controlled to minimize parasitic capacitance and inductance.\nBecause the component leads are\nusually quite short in RF circuits ,\nconsiderable stress can build up when\nthe leads are soldered to the strip-line\ncircuit board .\nThe new procedure consists of\nloosening a component from its\nmounting after each lead is soldered\nso as to relieve the induced stresses\nbefore the next soldering step . Using\nmounting screws that allow it to\n"float," a component is centered on\nits site on the circuit board (see Figure\n1) . The screws are tightened, and the\nmost-stress-susceptible lead is soldered and allowed to cool to room\ntemperature . Then the screws are\nloosened so that the component is free\nto move, and the stress in the soldered\nlead relaxes .\nNext, the component is refastened,\nand the lead on the opposite side is\nsoldered. After the solder joint cools ,\nthe component is loosened once more\nand allowed to center itself so that the\nstress in the second lead is then\nshared by the two leads. The maximum stress on each lead is thus onehalf that originally on the second\n(more lightly stressed) lead . Finally,\nthe screws are retightened and\nsealed .\nIn a typical soldering operation , a\nlead is heated to about 500 0 F (260 0\nC) . Solder is applied, melted, and\nsolidified at 361 0 F (183 0 C) (for a\nsolder composition of 63 percent lead,\n37 percent tin) .

The\nprocedure also avoids the need to\nrework part of a circuit board for the\nattachment of a new cable .\nThe repair technique consists of\npeeling back the plastic insulation\ncoating on the cable to expose the\nbroken conductors (see figure) , soldering conductive bridges across the\ngap, and replacing the peeled-away\ninsulation with an overlapping coating\nthat allows the cable to flex without\noverstressing the repaired area .\nFirst , the original coating is carefully cut at the edges of the damaged\narea . The cuts are made at a distance\nof 0.1 inch (2 .54 millimeters) from the\noutside edge of the broken conductors . Another cut is made across the\nconductors to release two flaps of the\ncoating that can be peeled back . The\nincisions are made with a sharp,\npointed knife at low pressure .\nThe exposed conductors are\ncleaned , and new pretinned conductors are soldered over the broken ones\nso that they extend 0.03 inch (0 .8\nmillimeter) on both sides of the\nfractures .\nThe\nconductors\nare\nchecked for electrical continuity and\nisolation from adjacent conductors .\nThe flaps of coating material are\nfolded back into place .

At the same\ntime, it is desired that the diffused\ndopants penetrate deeply into the\ncrystal.\nIn preliminary tests, such deep\nnarrow channels of diffused zinc in\ngallium arsenide (GaAs) were obtained by lightly scratching the surface\nof the GaAs crystal wafer. It is\nconjectured that the density of defects\nthus formed (dislocations) locally\nincreases the zinc diffusion coefficient. (Enhancements by a factor of 6\nhave been observed .)\nAs shown in the figure, which is a\nsketch of typical results obtained thus\nfar, the diffusion front is narrow and\ndeep, as requi red. A layer of zincdoped gallium arsenide , about 8\nmicrometers deep, is formed at the\nsurface of the crystal. This shallow\nlayer can be etched away. In the\nregion that has been scratched, the\nspike formed by the zinc-diffused\nregion penetrates about 50 micrometers below the shallow region .\n\nCRYSTAL\nSURFACE\n\nSCRATCH\n\nGaAs\n(n-TYPE)\n\n~\n~\n\n.----------------~----\n\nA Controlled SpIke Appears In the zinc diffusion front where the GaAs surface has\nbeen lightly scratched .\n\nThe diffusions were done at 850 0 C.\nOther temperatures , however, can be\nused .

Since the shielding net can be\neasily damaged by closed blades\npulled along it, these strippers are not\nreadily usable for shielded wires .\nA simply-constructed prototype wire\nstripper guards against damage to the\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1979\n\nshielding and forms accurately controlled cuts in a wire to strip the\ninsulation . Though especially useful\nfor stripping insulation from shielded\nwires , it can also be utilized on\nunshielded wire to strip insulation from\nthe end or from a middle portion of the\nwire.\nAs illustrated , two pairs of jaws\npivotally mounted on a body move\n\nagainst and away from a wire\npositioned between the jaws. The\nwire, from which insulation is to be\nstripped , is inserted through the hole\nand held in one hand while the wire\nstripper is held in the other hand. The\nthumb and forefinger depress the first\nset of jaws , the blades of which -extending perpendicular to the axis of\nthe wire -- penetrate the insulation .\n(continued on next page)\n\n557\n\nThese are the transverse blades .\nCircumferential cuts are made by\nrotating the stripper .\nWhen this is done , the first pair of\njaws is released , and a second pair\nhaving blade edges extending parallel\nto the wire (the longitudinal blades) is\nsqueezed together to penetrate the\ninsulation . The wire is pulled back\nthrough the device, and longitudinal\ncuts are formed in the insulation . The\ntwo pieces of insulation cut from the\nwire are then easily removed .\nEach blade is located within a\nconcave block that centers the blade\non the wire and limits the depth of\npenetration of the blade into the wire .\nThe blades are held by setscrews that\ncan be loosened to reposition the\nblades for deeper cuts .\nTo strip insulation from ordinary\ntwisted-wire pairs , the blades that\nform longitudinal cuts are floating\ninstead of rigidly fixed .

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nFlatpack integrated circuits installed by stitch-bond/parallel-gap\nwelding can be considerably more\neconomical for complex circuit boards\nthan conventional solder-installed\ndual-in-line IC\'s. This is the conclusion\nof a study of the two approaches as\nappl ied to circuit packaging for spacecraft , where considerations of size ,\nweight , and reliability are of paramount importance . Terrestrially , the\nstudy results should interest the\ndesigners of packaging for complex\nhigh-reliability electronics , such as\nthat used in security systems, industrial process control , and vehicle\nelectronics .\n\n558\n\nIn considering package size, it was\nfound that it is possible to package\napproximately 2-1 /2 flatpacks in the\narea usually allotted for a single dualin-line package . The area required for\na 14-pin flatpack that is installed by\nstitch-bond/parallel-gap welding is\n0.711 cm 2 . The area required for a\n14-pin dual-In-line package is about\n1.9 cm 2 .\nThe weight per flatpack , using the\nstitch-bond/parallel-gap method , is\nabout 2.45 grams per IC, as compared\nto 3.67 grams for conventionallymounted dual-in-line packages . Thus,\nwhen printed-circuit boards having a\ncomplexity of hundreds of IC\'s and\nthousands of stitch welds are involved ,\nthe weight savings can be substantial .\n\nIn considering the ease of manufacture , the assembly time for one\nflatpack using the\nstitch-bond/\nparallel-gap process is 10 to 15\npercent less than the assembly time\nusing conventional processes . Moreover , there is a 20- to 3D-percent\nimprovement in the ease of performing\nrework\xc2\xb7 and a reduction of over 40\npercent in the engineering design/\npackage effort.\nThis work was done by Paul\nChvostal, Jay Tuttle, and Richard\nVanderpool of Ode tics , Inc . for\nJohnson Space Center.

Metalization employing polysilicon , a widely-used intermediate conductive material , had a similar problem .\nA\nnewly-developed\nmultilayer\nmetalization process applies metalization steps after the gate oxide is\ngrown . The process is keyed to a\nmodified ion-bombardment technique\nusing either E x B or a magnetron\nsputtering system producing low radiation levels at the MaS substrate\nsurface that can be easily removed by\nannealing . The approach is similar to a\ndc sputtering technique .

For example , N2H4 and KOH\netchants have been used to dissolve\nthe (100) silicon crystal planes more\nrapidly than the (111) planes . These\netchants applied through an appropriate mask are used to form the VMOS\nchannels.

The coating , which is dense ,\nwear-resistant , and nonporous , can\nbe applied in controlled amounts to\nvarious substrate configurations . The\nease of application to parts with\nintricate shapes and contours should\nmake the coating useful in automotive\nand aircraft manufacturing .\nThe fused cobalt and carbide hard\nfaCing coating is metallurgically bonded to valves and poppets, making it\nresistant to spalling and flaking . Also,\nit is resistant to thermal shock , and its\nmechanical shock characteristics are\nexcellent at cryogenic temperatures\n(immersion in liquid oxygen and liquid\nhydrogen) .\nThe hard-facing coating uses a\nnickel/boron/silicon braze alloy as a\nfusing medium . After the surface is\n\ngrit-blasted , a plasma gun applies a\nprecoat of the braze alloy and then a\nmixture of the braze alloy with the\ncobaltltungsten carbide alloy . (Both\nalloys are commercially available .)\nThe coating is subsequently fused at\n1,925 0 F (1,051 0 C) in a vacuum,\nargon , or hydrogen atmosphere . The\nchoice of atmosphere depends on the\ndesi red cooling rate .\nThe plasma gun appl ies a uniform\ndistribution of the carbide in the\nnicketlboron/silicon matrix, which is\nessential for good bonding . The\nbraze-alloy precoat helps wet the\nnickel alloy base, eliminating the need\nto nickelplate the substrate.\nTo obtain uniform nonporous hard\nfacing overlays, the carbide/braze-alloy ratio is controlled so that the fused\ncoating has a slightly wet appearance .\nAn excess of carbide gives a dry\nappearance . The alloy ratio is controlled by varying the plasma-gun power\n\nlevel. The deposition efficiency is also\na function of the gases and type of\nplasma gun being used .\nAn argon gas atmosphere prevents\noxidation of the cobalt and tungsten\ncarbide layer , which in turn promotes\nexcellect wetting of the braze alloy\nwith the carbide . With regard to oxidation of the carbide , the control of part\ntemperature, gun distance, and deposition efficiency of the mixture being\nsprayed is critical.\nThis work was done by Alexander\nBrennan and Arthur B.

Originally suggested for critical tungsten\ncomponents on the Space Shuttle, the\nmixture consists of 98 .5 percent\naluminum oxide and 1.5 percent\nsilicon dioxide . It is particularly useful\nin welding when there is a danger that\nthe welding arc can burn adjacent\ncomponents . If the coating is applied\nto nearby tungsten parts , it prevents\narcing .\nAlthough very pure tungsten can be\nforged , spun , drawn , and extruded ,\nthe impure metal is brittle and can be\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1979\n\nworked only with difficulty . Moreover ,\nbecause tungsten is refractive , it is\ndifficult to process , and powder metallurgical techniques are often necessary . Above 1,650 0 C it has the\nhighest tensile strength of all elements\nand has excellent corrosion resistance\nover the entire temperature range ,\nbeing attacked only slighty by mineral\nacids .\nBecause of its excellent hightemperature mechanical properties ,\ntungsten is useful for glass-to-metal\nseals, for numerous aerospace applications , and for radioactive shields.\n\nHowever, its susceptibility to oxidation\nis often a problem at elevated\ntemperatures .\nIn the new treatment , the tungsten\nis initially cleaned with acetone and\ngrit-blasted with clean 60-grit alum inum oxide . The coating is then applied\nby tlsing an arc-plasma gun .\nThis work was done by J. Lombard\nand M. Moynahan of Rockwell International Corp. for Marshall Space\nFlight Center.

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nExperimental pure-nickel pin-fin\ncold plates for heat exchangers have\nbeen fabricated by electrodepositing\nnickel covers on machined nickel\ncores. The process uses lower-cost\nproduction equipment than required\nfor vacuum-retort-brazed stainlesssteel cold plates . Furthermore , the\nfrequent replacement of short-life\nretorts required in vacuum brazing is\neliminated . Other advantages of electrodeposition are the ability to produce\ndifferent types and shapes of plates\nand the smaller size and weight of the\nplates due to the better heat-transfer\ncharacteristics of nickel versus the\nsteel. If adapted to mass production, it\nis estimated that nickel cold plates\nmight be made for about 30 percent\nless than stainless-steel plates.\nThe process (see Figure 1) is initiated by machine-tooling holes and\nport openings in the surfaced nickel\nplate that forms the core . Next the\npin-core gap is electric-dischargemachined on both sides of the nickel\nplate and filled with a rigid wax . One\ncommercially available wax that has\nbeen used for this application solidifies\ninto a hard, machinable filler at\napproximately 155 0 F (68 0 C) . Next ,\nexcess wax is scraped from both\nfaces, and silver powder is burnished\ninto the surfaces . The plate is then\nimmersed into an electrolytic bath for\nelectrodepositing nickel. The cold\nplate (Figure 2) is finished by melting\nthe wax out of the passages and by\ncleaning the passages with an appropriate solvent.\nThe resulting electrodeposited bond\nin pure nickel has a minimum ultimate\ntensile strength of 90 ,000 psi\n(621x10 6 N/m 2 ), a yield of 60 ,000 to\n65 ,000 psi (414x10 6 to 448x10 6\nN/m 2 ), an elongation of 25 percent ,\nand 85 percent reduction in area.\nSolid copper plates can be made by\nthe same method . Alternately , this\nflash nickel plating can be applied to\nstainless-steel cores following step g.\n\n566\n\n(8)\nSURFACED NICKEL PLATE\n\n(b)\n\n(e)\n\nWAX MATERIAL\n\n(f)\nBURNISH SILVER POWDER INTO WAX FACES\n(g)\nELECTRODE POSIT NICKEL\n(h)\nGAGING SURFACE\n\nELECTRODE POSITED\nNICKEL LAYERS\nMELT WAX AND CLEAN WITH SOLVENT\nTO CLEAR FLOW PASSAGES\n\nFigure 1.

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nA relatively simple apparatus can\nspeed up the quality control in tubebending shops . The accuracy of bent\ntubes is verified on a flat aluminum\ntabletop supporting a set of attachments. An assortment of clips , slotted\nangles , clamps , and bolts is secured\nto threaded holes on the tabletop (see\nfigure) according to the shape of a\n" standard " tube bent and measured\nexactly to the required configuration .\nOnce the setup is fixed , other tubes\ncan be quickly inserted to see if they\nare bent to the same shape .\nThe apparatus , developed for the\nSpace Shuttle tube-bending operation ,\nhas reduced the rework / rejection rate\nfrom over 20 percent to near zero\npercent.

The glass\nreticle , which fits into a microscope\neyepiece , contains two etched concentric circles .\nLooking through the microscope ,\nthe operator of the electron-beam\ndrilling machine determines that the\nelectron-beam trace on a target is\nwithin the inner circle , adjusting the\nbeam size and shape as necessary\n(see figure) . Then the operator inserts\nthe workpiece and its clamping tool on\nthe machine and looks through the\nmicroscope to make sure that the\nclamp does not extend within the\nreticle outer circle (adjusting the\nclamp as necessary) . This simple\nprocedure ensures that the electron\nbeam has the proper size and\ncircularity for the hole to be drilled and\nprevents the electron beam from\ndamaging the clamping tool .\nThe reticle previously used has\ncrosshairs with a scale on one of the\nhairlines . To check the beam for circularity and diameter, the operator first\ndirected the beam on a tungsten target\nand measured the beam trace with the\nreticle scale . The operator then\nrotated the eyepiece 90 degrees and\nmeasured the trace again . This twostep procedure was repeated for the\nclamping tool to ensure that the beam\nwould not strike it when drilling\ncommenced .\nThe new reticle speeds up the\nelectron-beam drilling process by\n\nBEAM\nTRACE\n\nEXISTING\nRETICLE\n\nNEW RETICLE\n\ny-\n\nWORKPIECE\n\nELECTRON\nBEAM GUN\n\nCLAMPING\nTOOL\n\nThe New Reticle contains two concentric circles: The inner circle insures beam\ncircularity , and the outer circle is a guide to prevent the beam from cutting the\nworkpiece clamp.

In the original procedure ,\n\n568\n\nvoids were filled with copper , and a\nstylus cadmium-plating cap was applied over the copper to prevent\ngalvanic corrosion by the large\nelectromotive potential\ndifference\n\nbetween the copper and aluminum .\nUnfortunately , the cadmium would\nvaporize in a flight environment\n(vacuum) and could not be used on\nflight-scheduled engines . In addition\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1979\n\nthe repaired area had to be remachined or lapped extensively to eliminate porous and scratched areas .\nA new approach using stylus nickel\nplating instead of the copper and\ncadmium plating has simplified the\nrepair procedure and allowed the\ncasting to be used in flight. The\ndamaged sealing surfaces are stylus\nnickelplated in one step . Superficial\n\nscratches and porous areas are\nremoved more easily from the repaired surface by simply lapping the\nsealing areas to the required finish .\nAlthough the method is aimed for\naerospace components , it may be\neasily incorporated into conventional\naluminum-casting technology.

Air\nentering the chamber through deteriorated pipefittings, valves, and gages\ncan oxidize the hot metal surfaces of\nparts being brazed or heat-treated .\nThen the process must be interrupted\nbecause oxidized surfaces will not wet\nwith the molten braze alloy nor will\nthey qualify as heat-treated components .\nAn economical procedure used with\nthe brazing furnace for the Space\nShuttle main-engine nozzle eliminates\nthis costly problem . A plastic shroud\nfilled with neutral gas (e .g., argon)\nencases all the critical external\ncomponents that may spring a leak. If\nthe leak occurs , harmless argon will\nenter the chamber, making it possible\nto finish the process before the\nshutdown .\nAll the fittings , valves , and gages\nare shrouded in transparent plastic\nsheet and sealed with tape (see\nfigure) .

That problem has\nbeen solved (see figure) by using a\nspark gap instead of a dropping\nresistor in the spark-discharge leg of\nthe starter circuit. The gap modifies\nthe discharge-circuit time constant by\npresenting an inversely-resistive discharge path . The net effect is that the\nconductance between tl;le tungsten\nelectrode (torch) and the work surface\nis increased and that the current is\napplied for a longer time, making it\npossible to develop an arc at inputs as\nlow as 10 A.\nBaSically the starter ionizes helium\nshield gas to create a conductive path\nfor the current generated by the\nwelding-machine power supply . The\nspark gap is set at 0.008\xc2\xb10.002 in .\n(O .20\xc2\xb10.05 mm). As the power is\napplied, no conduction occurs at the\ngap until the voltage reaches approximately 2,000 V; i.e ., the breakdown ,\nor ionization , level. The delay allows\nthe initial arc to occur with an\nincreased-voltage rise time at the\ntungsten electrode . Sufficient charge\nis then developed between the electrode and the work surface to initiate\nan arc for a prolonged time . Once the\narc is started, it is maintained at a\nlower voltage level than in the previous\narrangement due to sufficient concentration of metallic vapor between the\nelectrode and the working surface as a\nresult of the improved conduction .\nThis work was done by Thomas J.\nTaufer of Rockwell International Corp .\nfor Johnson Space Center.

Dark glass, of the same\ntype used in welder \'s goggles, is\ninserted under the rubber cushions on\nthe microscope eyepieces (Figure 1) .\nThe dark glass filters out harmful\nintense light from the welding torch\nand allows the welder to work on small\nparts at magnifications of 10 to 30\ntimes . Viewed without the dark glass ,\nthe torchlight can cause temporary\nblindness .\nThe filtered microscope makes it\npossible to weld miniature parts or\nrepair fine defects and at the same\ntime affords eye protection.

Without this jack , parts with\nunequal coefficients of expansion may\nbuckle and separate during the brazing process . The thermal jack compensates for this difference .\n\n572\n\nThe illustration shows how the\nthermal jack has been applied in\nbrazing tubes made from stainless\nsteel (A-286) into a jacket made from\nInconel 718 (which has a lower coefficient of expans ion than the tube\nmaterial) for the 10-ft (3-m) Space\nShuttle main-engine flight nozzle . In\n\nthis case, the jack was made from\naustenitic stainless steel (RA-330) to\nmatch the expansion of the tubes .\nThe assembly to be brazed was held\non the bottom by the furnace base\nfixtu re . The thermal jack was installed\nresting against the base fixture . It was\ncoupled to the jacket by lifting studs\nsecured on top by nuts.\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1979\n\nAs the assembly was heated, the\nthermal jack pushed against the base\nfixture and lifting studs , stretching the\njacket to expand at the same rate as\nthe tubes . Thus the tubes did not\nbuckle and disengage from their\nintended end locations.\nAfter brazing, the assembly was\ncooled; and the thermal jack contracted more rapidly than the brazed\ncomposite assembly, disengaging the\njack from the lifting studs. This is due\nto the fact that the brazed composite\nacquires a new linear thermal coefficient that is less than that of the\nthermal jack.\nThe thermal coefficients of the jack\nand the tubes need not b,e perfectly\nmatched . Minor differences may be\ncompensated by adjusting the length\nand thermal coefficient of the lifting\nstuds . For example, to increase the\nexpansion of the jack , the length of the\nlifting stud is increased by using a stud\nmaterial with a lower thermal coefficient than that of the jack. Conversely,\nopposite measures are taken to\nincrease the thermal coefficient of the\njack . Thus there is some leeway in\nselecting the thermal jack material.\nThis work was done by Carl T.\nArmenoff and Ross O. McKown of\nRockwell International Corp . for\nMarshall Space Flight Center. No\nfurther documentation is available .\nMFS-19365\n\nLIFTING\nSTUO\n\nThe Thermal Jack shown in this example has a coefficient of expansion matching\nthat of the tubes to be brazed . As the furnace is heated , the jack expands and\nstretches the lower-expanding-coefficient jacket so that the jacket and the tubes\nstay together during the brazing process [1 ,900\xc2\xb0 F (1,038\xc2\xb0 C)) . The total\ncompensation in this case is 0.2 in. (5 mm) for the 10-ft (3-m) assembly . As the\nbrazed assembly cools, the jack contracts faster and disengages from the lifting\nstuds.\n\nViewing Electron- Beam Welds In Progress\nA filter prevents "blooming"\nin a TV image of the weld.\n\nMarshall Space Flight Center, Alabama\nWith the aid of an optical filter, the\noperator of an electron-beam welding\nmachine can view a TV image of a\njoint that is being welded and can\nmake corrections as necessary .

The method was developed\nfor assembling bellows made of four\nplies of iron/nickel alloy sheets . The\nmethod consists of making successive\nstitch welds with the electron beam\nuntil the weld seam is completely filled\nin and all the plies have been\npenetrated .\nNine welding passes are made . The\nfirst three passes are made at\nprogressively higher beam power to\npenetrate more deeply into the metal\nin stages. The remaining passes are\nmade a short distance on either side of\n\nthe original weld to seal the seam .\nThe first pass, made at a beam\ncurrent of 5 milliamperes in the\nbellows fabrication , fuses the first and\nsecond plies . The second pass , at 10\nmilliamperes, penetrates the thi rd ply.\nThe third pass, at 13 milliamperes,\npenetrates the fourth ply . For these\npasses , the beam voltage is 120\nkilovolts, and the weld speed is 80\ninches per minute \'(2 meters per\nminute) .\nFor the fourth , fifth, and sixth\npasses, the beam is deflected so that\nit strikes the metal surface 0.010 inch\n(0 .25 millimeter) inboard of the first\nweld . Beam currents for these passes\n\nare 3, 6, and 6 to 8 milliamperes,\nrespectively . As before, beam voltage\nis 120 kilovolts , but weld speed is only\n30 inches per minute (0 .75 meter per\nminute) .\nFor the seventh , eighth , and ninth\npasses, the beam is deflected to strike\nthe metal 0.010 inch outboard of the\nfirst weld . Weld conditions are the\nsame as in the fourth , fifth , and sixth\npasses .\nThis work was done by F. J. Kiluk of\nRockwell International Corp . for\nMarshall Space Flight Center.

A primer and\nadhesive were applied to the cleaned\nmetal surface. The rubber was then\npressed to the adhesive and cured at\n300 0 F (150 0 C) for 1 hour. This type\nof bond frequently failed under pressure or other loads . The weakness\nwas due to the diffusion of soft-rubber\nplasticizing agents into the adhesive .\nA new approach using a bond-cover\ncoat of unplasticized rubber between\nthe soft rubber and the adhesive\neliminated the diffusion problem . The\nresulting bond is much stronger and\nmore\' durable .\nFirst the metal surfaces [in this\ncase two disks 2 in. (5 cm) in\ndiameter] are prepared by sandblasting, washing with toluene, and drying\nwith acetone . The surfaces are conditioned by applying a coat of metal\n\n574\n\nprimer (Chemlok-205 or equivalent)\nand drying for 30 min. Next an\nadhesive coat (Chemlok-220 or equivalent) is applied over the primed\nsurface and dried for 1 hour . The\nadhesive layer will be covered with a\ncoat of unplasticized rubber .\nThe bond-cover coat is prepared by\ndissolving a quantity of milled and\nmixed rubber in the adhesive . The\nmilled and mixed rubber is prepared\nby dissolving Norsorex rubber, or\nequivalent , containing plasticizers and\ncuring agents , in toluene and exposing\nthe mixture to vacuum for 1.5 hours .\nThe rubber then is mixed with the\nadhesive and poured on an aluminum\nfoil to dry overn ight at room temperatu re . The resulting dried sheets are\nabout 30 mils (0 .8 mm) thick and are\ncut and removed from the foil to cover\nthe size of the bond area .\nThe cover coats are placed on\nadhesive surfaces of both metal\n\npieces, and the soft rubber to be\nbonded to the metal is sandwiched in\nbetween the cover coats . The entire\nassembly is molded and cured at\n300 0 F (150 0 C) for 1 hour .\nThis approach would be useful in\nmaking improved seals in automobile\nengines, industrial and public plumbing, and in other areas using softrubber-to-metal bonds . Seals and\ngaskets made this way would not have\nto be replaced very often, reducing the\ncost of maintenance .\nThis work was done by Johnny M.\nClemons , Frank E. Ledbetter III , and\nWilliam T.

Ultimately\nthese gases would migrate or diffuse ,\ncausing large voids with resulting part\nfailure .\nThe new technique involves manipulating the materials in such a manner\nthat all gas-containing materials are\noutgassed by exposure to vacuum\nprior to bonding, thus eliminating the\npotential voids or void formations . The\nvoid-free process consists of the\nfollowing steps (see figure) .\nStep 1: Surfaces of materials to be\nbonded are prepared to insure cleanliness . The cleaning process depends\non the type of material to be bonded .\nThe adhesive used should be viscous\n(greater than 100,000 cps) to minimize handling problems .\nStep 2: The parts are attached to a\nrolled metal picture frame that is\napproximately 10 percent longer and\nwider than the parts , to permit the\nbonded material to stretch. The\nthickness or S!trength of the frame\ndepends on the size and weight of the\nparts, on the final orientation of the\nbagged assembly during step 4, and\non the flexibility of the supports for the\nparts .

After closing the other end of\nthe female mold with a core mandrel ,\nthe loaded cavity is evacuated by\napplying a vacuum of 1 to 5 mm Hg for\n15 to 30 minutes . The mold temperature is raised to the minimum temperature at which the resin constituent of\n576\n\nthe compound will soften or plasticize ,\nand a pressure of 2,500 psi (173 x 10 6\nN/m2) applied by the pressure mandrel for 5 to 15 minutes. While\nmaintaining vacuum and temperature ,\nthe pressure mandrel force is reduced\nsufficiently to remove the female\npressure stop . When the 2,500-psi\nforce is reapplied , the compound,\nacting as a hydraulic fluid , propels the\nfemale as the mandrel ends converge .\nThis movement continues until the\nfemale mandrel again lands on a\npreselected pressure stop . At that\npoint a second pressure stop is placed\nto prevent further penetration of the\nfemale mandrel by the pressure\nmandrel.\n\nPressure mandrel force is then\nincreased by about 10 percent , and\nthat of the core-mandrel pressure is\nreduced to assume the 2,500-psi\nmolding pressure .

A\nsaw is used to cut parallel grooves into\nthe skin surface along its entire length .\nThe depth of the saw cuts is about\none-half the skin thickness, and the\nwidth between the cuts is chosen such\nthat the strips will be easily peeled off.\nThe strips are then peeled \'off one by\none with a slotted pipe by inserting the\nedge of the skin into the slot and\npeeling it off like a sardine-can\ncover.\nThis method was successfully used\nin replacing aluminum alloy skin 0.032\nin .

The\nsubstrate was then cleaned and the\nnew skin bonded in place.\nThe entire operation of grooving,\npeeling, and fabricating the slotted\n\npipe took about 2 hours . Chemical\nmilling or replacement would have\ntaken much longer .\nThe method may be useful in\nremoving bonded skins from any\nsubstrate where the substrate is\nstrong enough not to buckle or tear\nwhen bonded skin is "rolled " free .\nAlso it may be useful for removing\nsections of damaged skin where\nbladders or other equipment below the\nsubstrate might be damaged if a saw\nor router were used to cut completely\nthrough the skin.\nThis work was done by Eldon N.\nChartier of Rockwell International\nCorp. for Johnson Space Center.

Cost equations for assembly and test are based on package\ncost , active and passive chips, package lid, pretin cost , bonding chips,\nwire bonding , nondestructive pull test,\npreseal visual quality control, preseal\nelectrical test, troubleshooting before\nsealing, rework before sealing, preseal inspection , sealing, postseal\nacceptance test, troubleshooting after\nsealing , rework after sealing, and final\nquality-control inspection .\nThe study recommends that these\nmodels be refined and broadened to\n\ninclude such other packaging techniques as ceramic-chip carriers , multichip LSI "subassembly" arrays, and\nplastic LSI packages. The developed\ncost factors will be further refined and\nreduced to formulas for computer\nsolution.\nThe evaluation of tape chip-carrier\ntechnology has shown that this is a\nviable approach to low-cost LSI\npackaging and could also reduce\nhybrid\nmicrocircuit\ncosts.\nThe\nrecommended areas for future investigation include: wafer bumping,\ninner / outer lead bonding, testing, and\ntape processing .

However,\nif each of the reference and signal\nvoltages match , the phase wave front\nwill be essentially unperturbed .\nWhen at least one of the signal and\nreference voltages differs In magnitude , the resulting phase perturbation\nof beam II results in some light being\ndeflected by the hologram toward the\ndetector. Holographic subtraction Is\nfrustrated . This is the condition under\nwhich the MOCS device operates its\nrecord mode .\n\nThe IOC effectively combines two\nexisting\ntechnologies ,\nintegrated\noptics and holography, for the purpose\nof processing optical data. The integrated optical configuration offers the\nadvantages of size and ease of\nalinement. This device will greatly\nreduce the amount of useless data\naccumulated in remote-sensing operations such as are performed by the\nMOCS .\nThis work was done by David W.\nVahey and Carl M.

Losses caused by bends ,\nties , fittings, valves, and the like are\neasily included, and the analysis can\nsolve both steady-state and transient\ncases . It can also interact with a\nparallel thermal analysis .\nThe varieties of complex fluid-flow\nsystems that can be handled this way\nare difficult to analyze by conventional\nmethods . One important application is\nin the development of energy-efficient\nenvironmental control systems for\nheating and cooling homes and\nbuildings.\nThe analysis uses a finite-differencing technique that can be readily\nhandled by available computer programs . The fluid flow is assumed to be\nturbulent and incompressible throughout the system .\nThe basic equation describing a\npressure drop for a fluid flowing in a\nduct from point i to point j may be\nexpressed as\n\n(1 )\n\nwhere\n\nwhere\nP\n\'I\n\nf\nLe\n\n= pressure in the duct (Ibf Ift2)\n= fluid density [lb(mass)/ft 3]\n= friction factor (Moody)\n\n= equivalent\n\nlength of duct\nfrom point i to point j (ft)\nV\nmean fluid velocity (ft/s)\ngc\ngravitational constant\n[ft-Ib(mass) Ilbf-s 2]\nDe\nequivalent or hydraulic\ndiameter of duct (ft)\nMany available numerical-solution\nprograms are written to solve systems\nof equations of the form\n\n=\n=\n\n=\n\nx = Z(Yi - Yj)\n\n(2)\n\nwhere\n\nx\nZ\n\nY\n\n= heat, electric current, or fluidflow rate\n= thermal , electrical, or fluidflow conductance\n= temperature , voltage , or pres-\n\nsure\nEquation (1) therefore may be\nexpressed in the form of equation (2)\nas\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 =f\n\nm\n\noG\n\nL _ Pj)\n(Pi\n\n]1/2 W\n\nI\n\n_ p .)\nJ\n\n(3)\n\nm=\nG\n\n=\n\nfluid mass-flow rate\n[lb(mass)/s]\n~2g D A2\nflow coefficient\nf~e e\n\n=\n\n[ft2 - Ib 2 (mass)/lbf - h2]\nratio\n\'II \'10 , where\n\'I = the local air density\n[lb(mass)/ft 3] and \'10 is the\nreference air density for loop\nsimulation [Ib(mass) Ift 3 ]\nUsing equation (3), a network\nrepresenting any flow system may be\ndeveloped. Performance curves for\nany components , such as fan or heatexchanger performance, and valve or\nequipment pressure-drop characteristics may be input as arrays to be\nused in the solution process to\ndetermine system performance . Once\na network is established , parametric\nstudies may be rapidly and easily\nperformed by changing component\n(valve , heating units, fan , diffusers,\nheat , ducting exchanger, and the like)\ninput data . A fluid-flow system may\nthus be optimized without very complex analytical techniques .\nThis work was done by Ronald L.\nHolland of McDonnell Douglas Corp.\nfor Marshall Space Flight Center.\nFor further information, Circle 71 on\nthe TSP Request Card.\nMFS-25125\no\n\n= density\n\n=\n\nComputer Programs\nThese programs may be obtained at\nvery reasonable cost from COSMIC ,\na facility sponsored by NASA to\nmake new programs available to the\npublic .

A flexible and easy-to-use system,\nit\nproduces\nline-printer ,\ntelevision-screen , and\nDICOMED\n\n584\n\nplots . Plots , from the quick and simple\nto the complex and sophisticated , can\nbe generated with only a basic knowledge of FORTRAN and the PLOTPAK\ncommands . Offering several advantages over standard hardware-support\npackages , the wide range of ready-touse graphics saves program-development time . PLOTPAK has proved to be\na useful part of the Atmospheric and\nOceanographic Information Processing System (AOIPS) in use at the\nNASA Goddard Space Flight Center .\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, Winter 1979\n\nThe PLOTPAK package has a\nplotting segment and a contouring\nsegment. The plotting segment includes ready-to-use commands for\nproducing linear , semilog , log/log ,\nand polar plots . The user may specify\nhorizontal labels , vertical labels , and\nvector characters of any size . These\nmay be placed either in terms of\ndevice coordinates or the user \'s\nplotting coordinates .\nGridding\nroutines automatically\ngenerate full grids , open grids , and\naxes with or without tick marks.\nSpecial line features include solid,\ndashed , multiple-character printer ,\nand character plotter lines . The\ncontouring segment can contour any\nregularly spaced or random data . The\ndata are fitted to the desired grid , and\nthe contour is generated at specified\nvalues . The contouring segment uses\nthe plotting segment for actual plot\ngeneration ; therefore all of the plotting-segment features are available\nduring the contour plotting .\nThe PLOTPAK system is written in\nFORTRAN IV PLUS and has been\nimplemented on a PDP 11 /70 computer under control of RSX 11 D with a\ncentral memoury requirement of approximately 32K of 16-bit words .\nPlotted output is generated for either\nthe line printer, the Hazeltine graphics\nterminal , the DICOMED plotter, or any\ncombination of these three simultaneously. The PLOTPAK system was\ndeveloped in 1977.\nThis program was written by D.\nRubin of Computer Sciences Corp. for\nGoddard Space Flight Center.

The need for long-range\ntransmissions has been increased to\nsupport global crop-production forecasting , local weather forecasting,\nsevere storm tracking and prediction ,\nwater availability studies, land-use\nsurveys, and pollution monitoring.\nThese applications involve high data\nvolumes, high transmission rates, and\nthe need for rapid throughput.\nThe most serious problems encountered in any high-speed data-transmission system are the occurrence of\nerrors and the need for bandwidth\ncompression . The most promising\napproach to eliminating , or at least\nsignificantly reducing, both of these\nproblems is the use of encoding and\ndecoding algorithms to com press the\ndata for transmission and to correct\nerrors upon receipt.\nA new decoder computer program\nis a hybrid between the optimal Viterbi\nand the optimal algebraic decoders .\nTests have shown that the hybrid\ndecoder outperforms any strictly\nViterbi or strictly algebraic decoder\nand effectively handles compound\nchannels . The algorithm developed\n\nuses syndrome-detecting logiC to\ndirect the two decoders to assume the\ndecoding load alternatively, depending\non the real-time channel characteristics .\nThe !llgebraic decoder component\nof the hybrid decoder is an optimal\n" 82" burst corrector suitable for\ndecoding nonsystematic convolution\ncodes . The algebraic decoder is\ncapable of correcting any short burst\nthat does not exhaust the storage\ncapacity of the decoder . It can also\ncorrect long bursts with a high probability without sacrificing the randomerror-correcting capability of the\ncode . The Viterbi decoder component\nof the hybrid decoder handles random\nchannel errors . When encountering\nlong bursts that are beyond the\ncapability of the algebraic decoder,\nthe overall system still tends to\noutperform a stand-alone Viterbi\nbecause error propagations are\nsuppressed .\nThe decoder algorithm is written in\nFORTRAN IV for batch execution and\nhas been implemented on the UNIVAC\n1108 with a central memory requirement of app roximately 55K of 36-bit\nwords . Access to the UNIVAC MATHPACK library is required . This program\nwas developed in 1978.\nThis program was written by Robert\nW. Boyd, Frank M. Ingels, and\nChung-Dau Mo of Mississippi State\nUniversity for Marshall Space Flight\nCenter.
