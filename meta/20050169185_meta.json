AFReCC materials will have various applications in advanced high-efficiency and high-performance engines: that is, the High Speed Civil Transport (HSCT), space propulsion components, and land-based systems. For example, silicon-carbide-fiber-reinforced silicon carbide matrix composites show promise for meeting the criteria of high strength, thermal conductivity, and toughness required for the HSCT combustor liner. AFReCC received R&D Magazine's prestigious R&D 100 Award in 1995. The fabrication process for these composites has three steps. In the first step, fiber preforms are made and chemical vapor infiltration is used to apply the desired interface coating on the fibers. This step also rigidizes the preform. The second step consists of resin infiltration, which after pyrolysis, yields an interconnected network of porous carbon as the matrix. In the final step of the process, the carbon-containing preform is infiltrated with molten silicon or silicon alloys in a furnace. This converts the carbon to silicon carbide leaving as little as 5 percent residual free silicon or refractory disilicide phase. This process is suitable for any type of small-diameter fiber (e.g., carbon, alumina, or silicon carbide) woven into a two- or three-dimensional architecture. This processing approach leads to dense composites where matrix microstructure and composition can be tailored for optimum properties. It has much lower processing cost (less than 50 percent) in comparison to other approaches to fabricating silicon-carbide-based composites. The photograph shows the various AFReCC components. Thermomechanical and thermochemical characterization of these composites under the hostile environments that will be encountered in engine applications is underway.", "title": "Affordable Fiber-Reinforced Ceramic Composites Win 1995 R and D 100 Award", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-23T05:12:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-09-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20050169185, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20050169185, "id": "6e87e67442104989b0e38f8d77366156", "publicationDate": "1995-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
