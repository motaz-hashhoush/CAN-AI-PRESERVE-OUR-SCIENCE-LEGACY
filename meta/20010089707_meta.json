The project is entitled \"Clump Giants in the Hyades.\" This observation of one of the late-type Hyades giants has implications for understanding the formation of late-type stellar coronae as a function of the evolutionary state of the star. As of the call for this report, the data had been obtained by the satellite, but not delivered to the PI until 2001 August 7. Thus the progress can only be described as preparation for the data to arrive. To this end the PI and Co-Is are working on spectral analysis tools for the X-ray band. The PI has attended two workshops this summer in which results on late-type stellar coronae were presented, including XMM results from GTO team members, one entitled \"Stellar Coronae in the Era of Chandra and XMM-Newton\" at ESTEC in Noordwijk, and the \"Cool Stars Workshop\" in Boulder, Colorado.", "title": "Clump Giants in the Hyades", "stiType": "CONTRACTOR_OR_GRANTEE_REPORT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-20T12:07:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20010089707, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Brickhouse, N."}, "organization": {"name": "Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory", "location": "Cambridge, MA United States"}}, "id": "7f6665655da34b72af985d4e3f11a1bc"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Contractor or Grantee Report", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-22T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20010089707, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20010089707, "id": "1551862c5652472d8a12b1ebf9c237ac", "publicationDate": "2001-08-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
