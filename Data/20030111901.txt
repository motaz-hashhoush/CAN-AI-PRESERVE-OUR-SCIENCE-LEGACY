We also have put considerable effort in getting our results to the\npublic via public lectures and through press releases. Taking a very broad view of our program,\nwe are investigating the evolution of galaxies and clusters of galaxies from their birth,\napproximately one billion years after the begnning of the Universe, to the present. We have\nfound and characterized a population of galaxies that are no more than 1.4 billion years old.\nThese may well be the Universe\xe2\x80\x99s first generation of infant galaxies. Looking at the Universe\n500,000 years later, we see what appears to be a cluster of galaxies just beginning to form (a\nproto-cluster) around a luminous radio galaxy. Moving forward in time and closer to the present,\nwe are studying clusters of galaxies that are less than half the age of the Universe. Our\nobservations and analysis lead us to the important conclusion that the elliptical galaxies in these\nclusters must have had their last significant star formation some three billion years earlier, which\nis about the time when the proto-cluster was forming. Coming still closer to home, we are\nobserving nearby massive clusters of galaxies that are approximately 12 billion years old. The\ngravity from these large aggregates of dark and luminous matter is so strong it warps space-time\nitself, and makes the cluster act as a cosmic telescope that magnifies the distant galaxies behind\nthe cluster. We used the magnified (or lensed) galaxies to map the dlstribution of the dominant\nmatter within the clusters, which is the so-called dark matter (the matter is invisible, and its\nnature is unknown). We also are using these cosmic telescopes to study the distant lensed\ngalaxies that would otherwise be too small and too faint to be seen even by Hubble and the ACS.\nI\n\nWithin our home galaxy, the Milky Way, we have ACS coronagraphic observations of nearby\nstars that show new details in the dusty disks from which planets form. We may even see the\n\xe2\x80\x9cfootprints\xe2\x80\x9d of a young planet in one of the disks. We are working on our first coronagraphic\nobservations of the closest stellar system to the earth, Alpha Centaurus A and B, to see if we can\ndetect a Jupiter-like planet. Although nature is unlikely to be so kind as to provide us with a\ndetectable planet, we think the result would be so important for astronomy and the Hubble\nprogram that we are will to expend a modest number of orbits on this program. Even if we do\nnot find a planet, we are demonstrating a new planet-searching technique that can be\nimplemented in future space telescopes designed specifically to detect planets.\nWe have found that regular meetings of the ACS team are needed to insure that all of the\nimportant problems that can be addressed with our images are in fact being worked on by\nsomeone in the team. The team meetings also enable us to coordinate our work and bring\nscientists together where necessary to work on a particular problem, and to avoid duplication of\nNAG5-7697 Technical Report (12-1-02 through 11-30-03)\n\n1\n\neffort within the team. To this end we had two team meetings during the past year. The first was\na meetingof those team members who are working on the evolution of galaxies and clusters of\ngalaxies. The meeting was held at the Lorentz Center of the University of Leiden in the\nNetherlands, and was hosted by our two team members who are professors at the University\n(Miley, the department chair, and Franx). Four additional team members were resident in\nEurope at the time (Homier, Overzier, Rosati, and Zirm), and thus could easily attend the\nmeeting. The meeting was viewed as scientifically successful by all of the participants. We had\na second meeting of our entire team in early fall at the Aspen Physics Center in Aspen, Colorado.\nBoth the Lorentz Center and the Aspen Physics Center are unusual in that both have conference\nrooms and offices where the participants can meet. We typically had meetings during the\nmornings, and small group discussions and work in the afternoons. The Aspen meeting was very\nsuccessful in that informal groups and collaborations formed to carry out the research that we\nagreed needs to be carried out during the coming year.\nAnother important component of our research program is complementary and supporting\nobservations made with the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest telescopes. As an example, deep ground based\ninfrared observations are needed to discriminate between the first generation of galaxies and very\ndusty galaxies at half the age of the Universe. During the past year we used 8-m and 10-m\ntelescopes in Hawaii and Chile to make observations to support our ACS program. We have\ndeveloped a close collaboration with the Department of Astronomy, chaired by team member\nLeopoldo Infante, in the Pontificia Universidad Catolica in Santiago Chile. This collaboration is\ngiving us access to the majority of the world\xe2\x80\x99s largest telescopes; further more, these telescopes\non the western slopes of the Chilean Andes are at the world\xe2\x80\x99s best observing sites.\nDuring the coming year four team members from Europe (Demarco, Mei, Miley, and Overzier)\nand one from Chile (Motta) will spend time at JMJ to work with us on ACS observations.\nOne important aspect of science is training the next generation of scientists. At the present time\nwe have six graduate students working with ACS team (Coe, Jee, Overzier, Rider, Sundar, and\nZekser). Four of these students are already working on PhD theses that will be based on ACS\ndata. Three of the theses deal with different aspects of gravitational lensing by chsters, and the\nfourth student is studying proto-clusters in the early Universe.\n\\\nAttached at the end of this report is a summary of the observing programs that have been\nexecuted to date. The details of our scientific findings can be found in the papers listed\nelsewhere in this report that we have published in refereed journals.\n\nPersonnel:\nDuring 2003, four new personnel joined the team at JHU, one new hire (Holden) started at\nand\nUCSC. In September, two assistant research scientists began. One (Goto) has expertise in\nclusters of galaxies and the other (Homier) in the area of star formation within galaxies. Two\nnew graduate students also started in September and will be cutting their teeth on searches for\nactive galaxies in ACS images (Rider) and a study of young stars and clusters in low surface\nbrightness galaxies (Srinivasan).\n,\nNAG5-7697 Technical Report (12-1-02 through 11-30-03)\n\n2\n\nA good portion of the year was spent searching for a soRware development project manager to\noversee tHe integration of the ACS pipeline and ACS archive. In the end, we asked our current\npipeline programmer to take on these new responsibilities and provide relief to the PhD\nastronomers who have been working in this role up until now. The search to replace the pipeline\nprogrammer is imminent. We had three scientists (Tsvetanov, Tran, and Sirianni) leave the team\nto take up positions at other facilities. We anticipate hiring two more postdoctoral fellows to\nbegin in 2004.\nProgramming and Software Development:\nPipeline Programming Milestones:\nThe ACS pipeline group writes, manages, and runs the ACS GTO pipeline APSIS as well as the\nsoftware needed to organize the input data and inspect the resultant output data. The pipeline\ngroup consists of K. Anderson (programmer), D. Magee (programmer), J. Blakeslee\n(scientistlprogrammer),N. Benitez (scientistlprogrammer), G. Meurer (scientistlmanager), R.\nBouwens, N. Cross (scientist), and F. Menanteau (scientist). In the past year the pipeline group\nhas accomplished the following:\n9 releases of APSIS up to version 2.3.4 addressing 25 separate enhancement requests and bug\nreports. Some of the major issues addressed include:\nIncorporation of Galactic extinction calculation and correction.\nLanczos kernel interpolation in the final DRIZZLE product.\nCosmetic removal of amplifier step feature.\nSubstantial development work towards the next major release (version 3.0) of Apsis pending\nin October or November of 2003.\nCreation of stand-alone script to do drizzling: QUCKDRIZ.\nCreation of a stand-alone script to improve the astrometry in the header of an image using a\nquery to the HST Guide Star Catalog: FIXCRVALS. This task will be done as part of normal\nprocessing with APSIS under version 3.0.\nFull implementation of the program GROUPER which queries the Science Data Archive\n(SDA) and determines which data belongs together, primarily based on telescope $inting\nand the instrument plus detector combination. Subsequent enhancements to GROUPER\nallow parallel data to be grouped.\nDevelopment and implementation of the "ACS Data Control Graphcal User Interface" or\nADCGUI. ADCGUI provides a graphical interface to GROUPER and APSIS, allowing the\nuser to control the major aspects of the pipeline data flow including (1) logically grouping\ndata in the SDA, (2) retrieving the data, (3) creating an APSIS job queue allowing APSIS\njobs to be consecutively run.\nFull documentation of APSIS including a general description, module-level documents, an\ninstallation guide and a setup document. These are published under "Documentation" at\nhttp://acs.pha.j hu.edu/science/pipeline/developmentl\nFinally, Ken Anderson takes over the task of pipeline and SDA manager fiom Gerhardt\nMeurer and David Golimowski, starting mid October 2003.\n\nNAG57697 Technical Report (12-1-02 through 11-30-03)\n\n3\n\nScience Archive Milestones:\n0\n\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\nReleased several new versions of the ACS Science Data Archve (SDA) user interface:\no v1.8 and v1.8.1 in March 2003\no v1.8.2 in April 2003\no vl. 10 in June 2003\no vl. 10.1 in August 2003\no vl. 10.2 in September 2003\nDemonstrated SDA user interface for team members at JHU.\nMarshaled retrieval and ingest of ACS data from STScI and from GTO science data pipeline.\nWrote SDA relewe notes and user guide for all major releases of the user interface.\nSome of the features added to the ACS Science Data Archive include:\n0 A control panel in the Object Map that allows users to pan across three-color APSIS\nimages with pixel bin settings of 1 to 8.\n0 Form controls in the Object Map control panel for setting the dimensions of the field of\nview, overlaying Kron apertures, and inverting the color palette.\n0 Function in the Object Map control panel which permits users to adjust the scaling of the\nimage display ("stretch") or set the degree to which the intensity histogram is clipped\nbefore the image is displayed.\nOption in the Object Map control panel to superpose a directional compass and pixel0\nscale bar on the image.\n0 Function in the Object Map control panel which allows users to select the correspondence\nbetween filter images and the red, green, and blue channels of the color image map.\n0 Ability to download Object Maps in PNG and PDF formats.\n0 Caching scheme for previously viewed images (sigmficantly reduces the time to\nredisplay the images and relieves the load off of the image server).\n0 Conversion from circles to polygons for the footprints of large objects displayed in the\nObject Maps (minimizes interference with smaller objects in the Object Map).\n0 External database query tool in the Object Summaries which searches for objects up to 10\narcmin from detected objects in the SIMBAD, NED, SDSS, MAST, and GSC2 databases.\n0 Ability to download detection-image cutouts in FITS format from the Object Summaries\nI\nand cutout array pages.\n0 Default formats for Object Maps and color cutouts (or "postage stamp") images changed\nfrom PNG to PEG.\n0 Addition of extinction-corrected magnitudes (and errors) to the Object Summary pages\nand Photometry Catalog.\n0 Filter magnitude and color constrained queries of the object catalogs are now supported.\n0 Redesign of results display to show all the magnitude and/or color information available\nfor the archive set(s) under examination.\n0 Extensive section of example object-catalog queries compiled and published in the help\nsection.\n\nGeneral Software Development and Management (wm.

Postdoc Brad Holden came into the program in the\nmiddle of the year as a fully supported researcher. Graduate student Kim-Vy Tran moved on to a\nnew position, but is still working with the team on some of the cluster programs, particularly\nMS1054.\nMajor activities:\n\nThis year was the first full post launch year, and it w s great to see the remarkable data produced\na\nby the ACS. The deputy-PI continued his extensive support for the program, worlung closely\nwith the PI to ensure that the science program will meet its objectives. With the successful\nlaunch of the ACS early in 2002 the effort of the Santa Cruz group focused first on data\ncalibration issues, and then on exploring and recovering science from the first series of science\nimages, particularly from the ERO data and the first cluster program results.\nNAG5-7697 Technical Report (12-1-02 through 11-30-03)\n\n19\n\nThe deputy-PI continues to work closely with the PI in defining and supporting the program, and\nworking with.the science team members to help set the broad direction of the ACS GTO science\nprogram.\nThe team members have contributed as follows:\nRychard Bouwens continued the development of his cloning software which handles the\nprojection of lower redshlft samples to higher redshlb. This software has been valuable for\nmaking accurate comparisons across redshift space, where differences in the PSF, pixelization,\nsurface brightness dimming, and effective rest-frame wavelength are all present. He has also\nextended the usefulness of this software to produce catalogs and redshift-clickable maps for a\nmulti-wavelength set of images with a variety of noise and PSF characteristics, invaluable in an\nera where large multiwavelength data sets are becoming more and more ubiquitous.\nScientifically Rychard Bouwens has been investigating the manner in which the rest-frame\ncontinuum UV luminosity density and sizes evolve at high redshift using recent ACS\nobservations. In an early paper using deep ACS cluster fields (RDCS1252-2927), combined with\nACS GTO team images of the HDF-N, he found a 2x fall-off in the UV luminosity-density from\n2-3 to 2-6. This paper has been accepted and has now appeared in the Astrophysical Journal. In\ntwo subsequent fields, the wide-area GOODS fields and ultra deep ACS parallel, he has\nconfirmed this 2-3x fall-off in the UV luminosity density over this redshift range. He has also\nfound an approximate 2x decrease in the visible sizes of high redshift objects from 2-4 to 2-6.\nThese results have been written up and are nearly ready for submission. His findings based upon\nthe new ACS data nicely confirm and extend the analyses he performed the previous year based\nupon the Hubble Deep Fields.\nDan Magee has continued work on the development of the data analysis pipeline (APSIS) which\nwill be used to automatically process the GTO program observations. His primary focus has been\nin the development of a software package which automatically searches the Science Data\nArchive (SDA) for new and updated data, groups the data into logical data sets, and initiates an\nunattended APSIS pipeline run of the data sets. He also continues work with GTO archiye team\nwith development of software for SDA including a web-base interface to BUCS, an ACS image\nsimulator. Dan has also provided support iB the planning and implementation of ACS and ground\nbase observations of GTO targets. He continues to provide system administration and support on\nLinux and Macintosh platforms for the UCSC component of the GTO team. His duties include\nmaintaining and upgrading systems and equipment, troubleshoot and repair of malhctioning\nequipment, and install, manage and support astronomy and scientific software packages. Dan\nalso provides assistance in evaluation and implementation of new technologies which may\nbenefit the GTO team. The ground-based observations with Keck are a key part of the\ncomplementary data needed to analyze the ACS data. Dan has supported the Keck runs with\ngeneration of the astrometric solutions for the fields and plays a major role in the preparation of\nthe spectroscopic masks, as well as being an experienced observer.\nBrad Holden began working on studying the evolution in the sizes, luminosities, and structural\nparameters of cluster galaxies. These measurements involve fitting surface brightness profiles,\n\nNAG57697 Technical Report (12-1-02 through 11-30-03)\n\n20\n\nwhich he has done with two different approaches. One is to use GIM2D which is based on a\nMonte Catlo fitting algorithm while the second is to use Galfit which fits using a more common\nsteepest descent fitting algorithm and, therefore, is potentially less robust. He constructed a\nuniformly selected sample of cluster galaxies spanning a large range of redshift using both\narchival Hubble Space Telescope data along with data created for the Advanced Camera for\nSurveys Science Team. He is currently measuring the amount of evolution in the distribution of\nsizes and luminosities. In addition, he is playing a key role in the ground-based program to\ndetermine cluster membership, leveraging his previous experience with cluster redshift surveys.\nKim-Vy Tran\'s efforts with cluster datasets are now being applied to the MS1054 ACS data. She\nsupplied her extensive Keck redshift catalog to the GTO team and is now part of projects\ndesigned to test the morphology-density relation at high redshift and the star formation rates in\nthe cluster environment.\nThe deputy-PI has continued overseeing the efforts of the group, working closely with the\nindividual members on planning and implementing the science programs. Extensive time and\neffort has been committed also to developing the team\'s overall science program in conjunction\nwith the PI, as well as working with the PI to ensure that the science data processing techniques,\nthe software resources, the science database, and the team personnel are being utilized\neffectively for our program. These responsibilities have required many tips to be taken to\nBaltimore to work with the PI at JHU.\nThe deputy-PI has also been very active this year in working with the PI on getting the first\nscience results out at workshops, and malang the results of the ACS GTO program visible to the\ncommunity. Talks were given at two major workshops on (1) surveys of high redshift galaxies\nand (2) on the nature of galaxies at high redshift. A poster was given at another conference at the\nInternational Astronomical Union triennial conference.\nThree Keck observing runs were also supported where the data and the science results will be\nused for our ACS science program -- the spectroscopic data will be used to constrain the\nevolution of galaxies in the cluster environment at redshifts ~ 0 . 5and to calibrate the\n,\nphotometric redshifts and properties of the 2-6 galaxies detected in several ACS fields. Such\ndata will provide the baseline on which we will build our higher redshift ACS cluster results.\nThese activities are structured so as to allow us to have (1) a scientific program that keeps\ncurrent with the latest developments in our field so that we can ensure that our observational\nprogram is up-to-date, and is focused on contemporary issues and questions, and (2) supports the\nteam\'s efforts in getting scientific results out from the new ACS data as quickly as possible.\nSignrfcant equpment purchases and updates:\nThe group\'s desktop and laptop systems were upgraded at various times during the year to take\nadvantage of significant improvements in personal computer hardware (memory, disk dnves\netc...) as the processing etc requirements began to increase with the new data. A first G4 Apple\nsystem w s acquired as we begin to utilize the unique advantages of Apple computers. The\na\nstability of the software and the availability of interfaces make this a reasonable choice for\n\nNAG5-7697 Technical Report (12-1-02 through 11-30-03)\n\n21\n\nenvironments needing both unix capability and more general software tools, in addition to welldevelope&drivers for hardware devices. Two Apple Powerbooks have been acquired. An IBM\nThinkpad was acquired for the new postdoc, Brad Holden.\nSpace Telescope Science Institute\nP.I. of subcontract: Marc Postman\nMarc Postman\n\nM. Postman spent six months on sabbatical at JHU. Postman worked primarily on analyzing data\nacquired for the intermedate redshift cluster survey. Specifically, Postman provided visual\nmorphological classifications for -3000 galaxies in MS1054, RDCSO152-1357, and RDCS12522927. With Blakeslee, Franx, and Rosati, he used these classifications to characterize the\nevolution of the early-type red-sequence by determining the properties of the color-magnitude\nrelation in RDCS1252 at a redshift of ~ 1 . 2 4At the core of the cluster is an extensive early-type\n.\ngalaxy population surrounding a central pair of galaxies that show signs of dynamical\ninteraction. The early-type population defines a very tight sequence in the CM diagram, with an\nintrinsic scatter in observed (i-z) of 0.029 +/- 0.007 mag based on 52 galaxies, or 0.024 +/- 0.008\nmag for -30 ellipticals. Simulations using the latest stellar population models indicate an age\nscatter for the ellipticals of about 34%, w t a mean age > 2.6 Gyr (corresponding to z > 2.7),\nih\nand the last star formation occurring no later than z - 1.5. Transforming to rest-frame (U-B), it\nwas found that the slope and scatter in the CM relation for morphologically selected early-type\ngalaxies shows little or no evidence for evolution out to z - 1.2. A paper presenting these results\nwas published in October 2003.\nPostman developed the software to derive the morphology-density relation fiom the ACS cluster\nimage data. The relationship is clearly detected in our two A . 8 3 clusters and is approximately\nconsistent with that seen at lower redshift. A paper presenting these results is in preparation.\nPostman was P.I. on two Gemini NIRI proposals to search for 2>7 objects by identifiing z-band\ndropouts. Both proposals were successful and the IDT received 40 hours of time to perform the\nsurvey. The targets for this program are the central regions of a handful of our strongly lensing\nclusters observed with ACS, where the magnification from the gravitational lensing can reach\nfactors of 30 making detection of the dropout galaxies in the NIR J-band feasible with a few\nhours of integration time.\nPostman is providing supervision for Tom0 Goto, an ACS post-doctoral fellow who began his\nresearch position at JHU this summer. Postman gave two invited ACS related talks this year\none at CMU in Pittsburgh and one at the Carnegie Symposium on Galaxy Clusters in Pasadena.\nPostman also attended all off-site ACS science team meetings (Leiden and Aspen).\n\n-\n\nR White\nR. White has devoted most of his efforts to analysis of the ACS observations of strongly lensing\nclusters. The gravity from clusters of galaxies deflects the light coming from background\ngalaxies and acts as a gravitational lens. The resulting images are often spectacular, with\nNAG57697 Technical Report (12-1-02 through 11-30-03)\n\n22\n\nmagnifications greater than a factor of 100 and distorting small galaxy images into very long,\nthin arcs. White developed a new mass modelling program, based on idea by Broadhurst but with\nsome significant improvements, and applied it to observations of Abell 1689. He is supervising\ntwo JHU graduate students, Kerry Zekser and James Jee, who are planning Ph.D. theses on the\ntopic of gravitational lensing. Zekser extended White\'s lens modelling program to allow\nconstruction of delensed source images and plans to apply it to other strongly lensing clusters to\nbe observed as part of the ACS GTO program. She is studying the mass distribution in the\nclusters, the magnified images of background galaxies, and the cosmological constraints that can\nbe derived when there are multiply lensed images of background sources at a range of redshifts.\nJee is analyzing weak lensing (which produces slightly distorted galaxy images) from ACS\nas\nobservations of z-1 clusters to derive m s models for those cluster.\n\nGSFC\nP.I.: Randy Kimble\nparticipated in technical discussions of WFC hot pixel annealing issue\nparticipated in science retreat, focusing on coronagraphic observations of protoplanetary\ndisks and assisting with preparations for observations of DDO 154 in dark-matter-dominated\ngalaxy program\nEfforts by our Off-site Collaborators (not subcontractors)\nThomas J.
