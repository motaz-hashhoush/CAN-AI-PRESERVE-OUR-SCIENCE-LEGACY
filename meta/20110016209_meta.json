Allowance oflead-free components presents one of the greatest risks to the reliability of military and aerospace electronics. The introduction of components with lead-free lenninations, tennination finishes, or circuit boards presents a host of concerns to customers. suppliers, and maintainers of aerospace and military electronic systems such as: 1. Electrical shorting due to tin whiskers; 2. Incompatibility oflead-free processes and parameters (including higher melting points of lead-free alloys) with other materials in the system; and 3. Unknown material properties and incompatibilities that could reduce solder joint re liability.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20110016209, "endDate": "2011-09-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "Aerospace Industries Association", "location": "Arlington, VA, United States"}}, "meetingId": "9a0a3213f0394c3aa7f7fdee37f11551", "id": "1677b0f8709a40f7bc6aa2557e0ac5a0"}], "name": "2011 Pb-Free Electronics Risk Management Consortium (PERM) Meeting No. 10", "location": "Crane, IN", "id": "9a0a3213f0394c3aa7f7fdee37f11551", "startDate": "2011-09-27T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20110016209, "id": "ca35372dd7ce4fc5a6177b31a1c56d55", "publicationDate": "2011-09-27T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20110016209.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20110016209/downloads/20110016209.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20110016209/downloads/20110016209.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20110016209/downloads/20110016209.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
