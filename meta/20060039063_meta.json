Smaller spacecraft may enable such missions.  Technology has been developed by the United States' Department of  Defense and other government agencies that can enable smaller spacecraft.  This author has developed a generic concept for utilizing advanced technology to create a microspacecraft.  A  microspacecraft would have a mass on the order of 10 kg.  This paper will present this microspacecraft concept.", "title": "Microspacecraft: A Concept", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-23T18:24:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20060039063, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Jones, R.
