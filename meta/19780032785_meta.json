The special features of the two-engine system, engine control system, and flight control system are mentioned. The main objectives of the XV-15 program are to (1) verify rotor/pylon/wing/dynamic stability and aircraft performance over a representative operational envelope, (2) assess the handling qualities and establish a safe operating envelope, and (3) investigate gust sensitivity, effects of downwash, and hover operation. With regard to rotor/pylon stability, one challenge is to be able to predict a parameter's value and then build hardware to match. The analytical program has gained some respect through aeroelastic and full-scale XV-3 demonstrations. Special concern centers around the thrust and power management system when flying at high speed when very small changes in rotor collective pitch represent large changes in thrust and power. Demonstration of the system awaits wind-tunnel and flight testing.", "title": "Tilt-proprotor perspective", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-09T09:19:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19780032785, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Few, D.
