b'MANUFACTURING AIDS\nA contractor\'s work for Lewis Research Center on\n"thermal barrier" coatings designed to improve aircraft\nengine efficiency resulted in two related but separate\nspinoffs. The Materials & Manufacturing Technology\nCenter of TRW Inc., Cleveland, Ohio invented a robotic\nsystem for applying the coating and, in the course of\nthat research, found it necessary to develop a new,\nexquisitely accurate type of optical gage (right) that\noffers multiple improvements in controlling the quality\nof certain manufactured parts.\nThermal barrier coatings, applied to turbine blades,\ncombustors and other parts, act as insulators to\nprotect against corrosion in the extremely hot engine\nenvironment. The protection thus afforded allows\nincreasing the operating temperature of an engine by\nseveral hundred degrees, a means of increasing overall\nengine efficiency.\nTRW\'s invention is a computer-aided, fully-automatic\nsystem for spraying a very hot plasma onto engine\nparts. Composed of a gas into which metallic and\nceramic powders have been injected, the plasma forms\na two-layer insulative coating. The system eliminates\nthe need for extra machining and tooling in production\nof turbine blades, because the blades are made by an\nadd-on process-adding the sprayed metal or ceramic\nplasma-rather than by removing metal, as most parts\nare made. Although the Lewis program focused on\naircraft applications, the plasma-spraying system can\nalso be used to coat industrial turbines for greater\noperational efficiency. NASA has granted TRW a\nwaiver allowing the company to market the system\ncommercially; it is already in operational service with\nTRW on an Air Force contract for coating aircraft\nengine blades.\nA critical part of the coating operation is controlling\nthe thickness of the plasma deposit, which\\is measured\nin thousandths of an inch. To assure exact coating,\nTRW developed an optical detector that illuminates\nspots at various locations on the blade, determines\nthicknesses by measuring reflected light, and monitors\nthe spraying process until precise coating thicknesses\nare attained. The detector became the basis for the\nsystem pictured, a computerized optical gage for\nmeasuring and inspecting turbine blades, vanes and\nother parts with complex shapes. A variable lens\nfocuses light on the part to be measured, then a device\nmeasures the intensity of the light reflected back\nto the lens; the light intensity is a basis for making\nmeasurements within a millionth of an inch. The\nsystem offers improvements in the quality of\nmanufactured parts and provides savings through\nelimination of inspection variables that occur in\nstandard methods of inspection. The gage is now in\nactive service with TRW\'s Aircraft Components Group.\nAlthough it is designed specifically for use on aircraft\nengine blades and vanes, similar equipment could be\nfabricated for many other complex geometry tools,\ndies and components.\n\n'
