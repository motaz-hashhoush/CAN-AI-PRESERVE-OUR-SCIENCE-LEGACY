The effort, lead by SMDC, was intended to develop a three-stage liquid bipropellant (liquid oxygen/liquid methane), pressure-fed launch vehicle capable of inserting a payload of at least 25 kg to a 750-km circular orbit. The vehicle design was driven by low cost instead of high performance. SWORDS leveraged commercial industry standards to utilize standard hardware and technologies over customized unique aerospace designs. SWORDS identified broadly based global industries that have achieved adequate levels of quality control and reliability in their products and then designed around their expertise and business motivations.", "title": "Soldier-Warfighter Operationally Responsive Deployer for Space", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2016-06-29T09:30:06.7800000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20160008028, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Davis, Benny"}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Marshall Space Flight Center", "location": "Huntsville, AL, United States"}}, "id": "139289e42a264047a60d0eba1dce4e80"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 20160008028, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Huebner, Larry"}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Langley Research Center", "location": "Hampton, VA, United States"}}, "id": "c841229ad4254a858cd8fd8c052bc3e5"}, {"sequence": 2, "submissionId": 20160008028, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Kuhns, Richard"}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Kennedy Space Center", "location": "Cocoa Beach, FL, United States"}}, "id": "46150c18b03d41eba655ae73a3a7e429"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "id": 20160008028, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20160008028, "id": "fac883d76ef94572a3393df5cdac4f9a", "publicationName": "George C.
