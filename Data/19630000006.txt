b"April 1964\n\nBrief 63-10009\n\nN Avz\xc2\xa7^^ TECH BRIEF\nThis NASA Tech Brief is issued by the Technology Utilization Division to acquaint industry\nwith the technical content of an innovation derived from the NASA space program.\n\nhain Friction System Gives Positive, Reversible Drive\n\n7 I i\nA\t\n(/,.\t\n\nI\n\n(t/,\n\nI\n\nNeoprene\nSurf\nam\n\nThe problem: With large reduction ratios in a\nchain drive, the bigger gear is costly to buy or\nmachine. Being relatively heavy, it also introduces\ninertial problems in service that requires rapid acceleration or reversal. Ordinary belt drives, though lighter\nand quieter than chain drives, are of course less\npositive.\nThe solution: Use of a conventional metal silent\nchain with its teeth bearing against a rubber-covered,\nflat-faced aluminum pulley. The result is a positive,\nreversible drive that operates with minimum noise and\nvibration. With a suitable idler tensioning device, the\ndrive has negligible backlash.\nHow it's done: A strip of an elastomer (e.g., neoprene 3/16-in thick) is cemented to the smooth metal\nrim of the pulley. Standard commercial chain is wrapped around the pulley and kept under suitable tension\nby neoprene covered idlers. The drive gear is a standard steel pinion.\n\nThis document was prepared under the sponsorship of the National\nAeronautics and Space Administration. Neither the United States Gocernment, nor NASA, nor any person acting on behalf of NASA: A. Makes\nany warranty or representation, express or im plied, with respect to the\naccuracy, completeness, or usefulness of the information contained in\n\nNotes:\n1. This inexpensive, light, low-inertia drive appears\nespecially adapted for large reduction ratios, and\nfor rapid accelerations. It is well suited to mechanical servos because it can have virtually no backlash.\n2. The drive was originally constructed at the Ames\nResearch Center for a motion simulator having\ntwo large driven pulleys, one 10 and the other 15\nfeet in diameter. Commercial chain having 3/8\ninch pitch and 2 inches wide is employed. One\ndrive motor is of 15 horsepower, intermittently\nsubjected to substantial overloads; and accelerations up to 18 radians per second per second are\nachieved.\nPatent status: NASA encourages commercial use\nof this innovation. No patent action is contemplated.\nSource: Jess S.
