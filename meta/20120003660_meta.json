Two of these machines have been used to move space flight vehicles at Kennedy Space Center since the Apollo missions of the 1960's and relatively few modifications have been made to keep them operational. In September of 2003 during normal Crawler/Transporter operations cracks were observed along the roller pad surfaces of several tread belt shoes. Further examination showed 20 cracked shoes on CT-1 and 40 cracked shoes on CT-2 and a formal failure analysis investigation was undertaken while the cracked shoes were replaced. Six shoes were cross-sectioned with the fracture surfaces exposed and it was determined that the cracks were due to fatigue that initiated on the internal casting web channels at pre-existing casting defects and propagated through thickness both transgranularly and intergranularly between internal shrinkage cavities, porosity, and along austenitic and ferritic grain boundaries. The original shoes were cast during the 1960's using a modified 861330 steel with slightly higher levels of chromium, nickel and molybdenum followed by heat treatment to achieve a minimum tensile strength of 11 Oksi. Subsequent metallurgical analysis of the tread belt shoes after multiple failures showed excessive internal defects, alloy segregation, a nonuniform ferritic/ bainitic/martensitic microstructure, and low average tensile properties indicative of poor casting and poor heat-treatment. As a result, NASA funded an initiative to replace all of the tread belt shoes on both crawler/transporters along with a redesign of the alloy, manufacturing, and heat-treatment to create a homogeneous cast structure with uniform mechanical and metallurgical properties. ME Global, a wholly owned subsidiary of ME Elecmetal based in Minneapolis, MN was selected as manufacturing and design partner to develop the new shoes and this paper describes the research, development, and manufacturing that resulted in the successful delivery of 1044 new Crawler/Transporter tread belt shoes all meeting rigid metallurgical and mechanical design criteria derived from finite element modeling of the stress loads required for safe space shuttle transport.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "Austria", "submissionId": 20120003660, "endDate": "2006-09-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "15th Congress of International Federation for Heat Treatment and Surface Engineering (IFHTSE 2006)", "location": "Vienna", "id": "1808e3d15a7149f4a2b2495ea50997b7", "startDate": "2006-09-25T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20120003660, "id": "25d7b0ed3cb440e88a73c1f6674d7aa0", "publicationDate": "2006-09-25T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20120003660.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20120003660/downloads/20120003660.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20120003660/downloads/20120003660.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20120003660/downloads/20120003660.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
