(3) Breccia dikes, collectively named\nSudbury Breccia, which are irregularly distributed in the basement\nup to a radial distance of at least 55 km from the SIC [6]. They have\na random orientation and range in thickness from millimeters to\nsome 300 m. Four generations of dikes have been identified [6] that\ndiffer in matrix characteristics (crystalline to clastic), thickness,\nclast content, and contact relationships. The composition of the\nmatrix typically resembles the composition of the country rock and\nthe cl as ts are derived from the local rocks except for very large dikes\nwhere clasts were moved over distances of up to 800 m. Shocked\ncl as ts (stage I) within the dikes occur only up to a radial distance of\n10 km from the SIC.\nSIC and Basal Member of Onaping (Fig. 1): The SIC has\nbeen studied only in its contact zones to die Basal Member and to\nthe Footwall Breccia. The Sublayer is a heterolithic breccia with a\ncrystalline melt matrix of mafic composition and abundant mafic to\nultramafic lithic clasts. It contains also clasts of FB as the latter\ncarries clasts of the norite and Sublayer. The contacts of the FB to\nthe norite are sharp whereas to the Sublayer they are either sharp or\ngradational [8,9]. Similarly, the uppermost section of the SIC\n(granophyre) shows sharp and gradational transitions to the Basal\nMember, which is a cl as t - rich impact melt breccia. Abundant clasts\n(up to 80 vol%), mainly from the Proterozoic Huronian metasediments, are embedded in a crystalline matrix with gr anophyric to\nvariolitic texture [10]. There is a chemical similarity between the\nSIC, especially the granophyre, and the melt breccia of the Basal\nMember confirming that both units represent a whole rock melt of\nPrecambrian target rocks. There is some indication for an increasing\nproportion of Proterozoic Huronian rocks toward the top of the melt\nsystem [4].\nGray, Green, and Black Members of Onaping (Fig. 1) [10,11]:\nThe Gray Member is a poly m ict clastic matrix breccia composed of\nlithic clasts of variable degree of shock and irregularly shaped melt\ninclusions that have a fine-grained crystalline texture and show flow\nstructures. Texturally, this breccia layer is similar to the suevitic\nbreccias found in the crater fill of many complex impact craters. The\nclastic breccia constituents are derived predominantly from rocks of\nthe Huronian Supergroup and, more rarely, from Archean basement\nrocks. The Gray Member is covered by a thin layer of a rather\nuniform, strongly chloritized breccia (Green Member, formerly\ncalled chloritized shard horizon). The contact varies from sharp to\ngradational. This breccia contains relatively fine-grained clastic\nmaterial in a microcrystalline matrix characterized by concavely\nshaped vugs filled with chlorite. Green Member is topped by the\ncl as tic matrix breccia layer of the Black Member, which, as a whole,\nis characterized by a carbonaceous matrix. In its lower unit it shows\nsimilarities to the Gray Member. The upper unit displays textural\nfeatures of reworking and sedimentation under aquatic conditions.\nA major fraction of the carbon is derived from organic matter and\nformed under euxinic conditions. The bulk chemical composition of\nthe whole sequence of clastic matrix breccias (Gray Member to\nB lack Member) is less siliceous and richer in Fe.Mg.K, and Nathan\nthe melt breccia of the Black Member [10,11 ]. It is not clear whether\nthis is due to secondary alteration processes or whether it reflects a\nprimary change in the composition of the source rocks of the clastic\nmatrix breccias. The REE patterns of all breccia units of the Onaping\nFormation arc quite similar and are well within the range of the\npotential source rocks from the Proterozoic and Archean basement.\nThe data obtained from the petrographic and chemical investigations of the breccia formations at the SS are compatible with die\nimpact basin model summarized in [2]. The interpretation of our\n\nresults with regard to the origin and emplacement of these formations are therefore different from most of the previous views as\nexpressed mainly in [5]. The present interpretation is as follows:\nThe Sudbury Breccias (dike compression of the crater basement by\nin situ frictional melting and by shearing processes during the\ngravity-induced breccias) were formed during shock collapse of the\ntransient cavity. The Footwall and Sublayer Breccias including the\noffset dikes were formed in the late stage of the transient cavity (TC)\nformation as crater floor breccias before the collapse of the cavity.\nThis holds also for the impact melt system and the suevitic breccias\nof the Gray Member that covered the central pan and the upper walls\nof the TC. As a consequence of its collapse the innermost, clast- free\npan of the melt layer within die TC pooled to a melt sheet filling die\ncentral depression as well as the depressions outside the now eroded\npeak ring and, immediately afterward, became covered by cl as t-rich\nmelt slumping in from higher regions of the TC wall. Similarly, die\nsuevitic material slumped into the depression from even higher\nportions of the TC wall. It was then covered by airborne fallback\nmaterial (Green Member) deposited from the ejecta plume. The\nBlack Member breccias are interpreted as material that was transported into the central depression by turbulent slumping from the\nwalls of the peak ring and by aquatic sedimentation of ejecta\nmaterial covering the ring region.\nReferences: [ 1 ] Avermann M. et al., this volume.

M Reid, University of\nHouston, Department of Geosciences, Houston TX 77204, USA.\nThe Vredefort Dome is located near the center of the Witwatersrand Basin, about 120 km southeast of Johannesburg, South\nAfrica. Its origin is enigmatic, ranging from a major impact event\n[ 1-3] to endogenous processes, either igneous [4\xe2\x80\x946] or tectonic [7].\nA unique melt rock, the "Bronzite" Granophyr, occurs in the\nVredefort structure as vertical ring dikes along the contact between\nsedimentary collar and core of Archaean granites, and as vertical\ndikes extending northwest-southeast and northeast-southwest in the\ngranitic core. The granophyre rocks have an unusual composition\nand high content of recry stallized sedimentary inclusions compared\nto common intrusive igneous rocks with similar SiO, content (61 to\n70% by weight). The unique nature of the granophyre has been\nunderlined in previous studies and origin hypotheses as an impact\nmelt or as a highly contaminated intrusive mafic magma have also\nbeen discussed [e.g., 8-10]. We present new results obtained from\na recent detailed petrographic and geochemical study of a very large\nand tex rurally diverse suite of "Bronzite" Granophyre, representing\nall dikes occurring at Vredefort.\nPetrography: Themajormineralphasesobservedinthegranophyre are hypersthene, plagioclase, orthoclase, quartz, pigeonite,\naugite, biotite. magnetite, and ilmenite. Only rare bronzite grains\n\nLPI Contribution No. 790\n\nare observed and they occur exclusively as xenoliths. None of the\nbronzitc grains are in equilibrium with the granophyre melt.\nTwo major types of granophyre are observed: (1) fine-grained,\nclast-rich dikes, confined to the central core of the structure that are\ndominated by a sphcrulitic texture and textural heterogeneity occur\nover distances ranging from millimeters to tens of meters produced\nby four spherulitic subtypes and an ophitk subtype texture; and\n(2) medium- to fine-grained clast-rich granophyre core-collar dikes\ndominated by hypidiomorphic textures [11]. Grain size of the\ngranophyre matrix minerals ranges up to 5 mm. The mineralogy of\nall dikes is similar with the exception of the higher modal abundance\nof biotite in the core dikes relative to the core-collar dikes. The\nspherulitic texture with skeletal crystal morphologies observed in\nthe core dikes is indicative of extreme undercooling conditions [ 12],\nwhile increased textural homogeneity characterizing the core-collar\ngranophyre dikes indicates more uniform and slower cooling histories.\nNumerous monomineralic and lithic fragments, up to 80 cm\nlong, compose up to 20% of the rock volume [11]. All the major\ncountry rocks are represented as inclusions in every dike examined.\nGranite, gneiss, and quartzite are the most abundant, mafic rock\nfragments and metasediments other than quartzite are less abundant, and shale inclusions are rare [10,11]. These abundant inclusions show intense recrystallization, reactions with the granophyre\nmelt, and melting. Rare shock features are observed in quartz grains\nand are restricted to remnants of decorated planar elements occurring as one set parallel to the c axis of individual quartz grains.\nChemistry: Chemical homogeneity, on a regional scale, is a\nmajor characteristic of the granophyre dikes of the Vredefort\nstructure. Homogenization was achieved early in the melt\'s history\nand was maintained as the melt intruded the fractured country rocks\nwhere it underwent cooling and crystallization under relatively\nundisturbed conditions.\nAlthough no gross differences in major- and most trace-element\ncompositions were detected mat could be ascribed to regional\nposition within the structure, minor chemical variations are present.\nThe granophyre dikes of the central core have higher SiO2, TiO2,\nAljOj, and K2O contents than the core-collar dike, while core-collar\ndikes have higher FeO + Fe2O,. MgO, CaO, and Nap contents.\nThese differences are thought to be due to differences in the\ncomposition and amount of local materials assimilated. Although\nthe granophyre melt is weakly differentiated, this is a minor factor\nin the evolution of the granophyre melt and differential assimilation\nis the major cause of the chemical variability observed.\nDiscussion: Metasediments and shale inclusions, from lithologies occurring within units stratigraphically higher than the present\nemplacement level of the granophyre dikes, are regionally distributed within all these dikes. This observation is hard to reconcile with\nthe processes involved in the intrusion of a magma from the mantle\nor upper crust and indicates that the granophyre melt must have been\nefficiently and dynamically mixed before being injected into major\nfractures. Highly heterogeneous clast populations from widely\ndifferent strati graphic levels, a complex thermal history, and injection of melt/clast mixtures into dikes are in agreement with processes related to impact melt formation. The first report of rare\nshock features in xenolithic quartz grains supports the melt origin\nby impact. Two reasons explain why shock planar features, observed in the source rocks [13], are rarely seen in inclusions of the\ngranophyre: (1) they have been annealed [13,14] and (2) shocked\nfragments are preferentially assimilated in the melt because they\nattained a higher temperature during the initial shock event [15,16].\n\n73\n\nConclusions: The matrix textures, the variable thermal effects\nin the inclusions, and the chemical variations presented for the\ngranophyre dikes of Vredefort are compatible with an impact melt\n[15,16]. Our observations and results indicate that the granophyre\ndikes best represent remnants of an impact melt mat intruded\nfractures of the transient crater floor of Vredefort We thus favor die\nVredefort structure as a deeply eroded mul tiring impact basin.\nReferences: [1] Dietz R.

Spray, Department of Geology,\nUniversity ofNew Brunswick, Fredericton.New Bnmswick.C\xc2\xabn*d\xc2\xab.\nThe Archean Levack Gneisses of the North Range host millimeterthick veins and centimeter- thick lenses of pseudotachylyte, as well\nas substantially larger meter-wide, dykelike bodies of pseudotachylytic "breccia." The "breccia" occurs up to several tens of\nkilometers away from the Sudbury Igneous Complex and is commonly sited within or near joints and other natural weaknesses such\nas bedding, dyke contacts, and lithological boundaries.\nThe larger "breccia" dykes comprise a generally dark matrix\ncontaining rounded to subrounded and occasionally angular rock\nfragments derived predominantly from Levack Gneiss. The matrix\nmay exhibit flow features and typically appears aphani tic, although\nin certain exposures it possesses a fine-grained crystalline texture.\nThe "breccia" fragments can be as large as 2-3 m in their long\ndimension and are typically chaotically arranged within the matrix,\nshowing evidence of both rotation and internal fracturing. More\nexotic rock fragments, such as amphibolite. also occur and these\nappear to have been transported for some distance (i.e. , at least tens\nof meters). The origin of the so-called Sudbury Breccias is a subject\nof controversy , but is generally believed to be related to the 1 . 85 -Ga\nSudbury event. Field evidence indicates that they are fault-related\nand frictionally induced and are therefore not the direct products of\nshock melting.\nSelected samples of bulk Sudbury Breccia and Sudbury Breccia\nmatrices have been chemically analyzed and compared to existing\ndata on the Levack Gneisses and Sudbury Breccia. The matrices are\napparently enriched in Fe and, to a lesser extent, Mg, Ti, and Ca\ncompared to the wallrocks and the majority of clasts. This enrichment can be partly explained by the preferential cataclasis and/or\nfrictional melting of hydrous ferromagnesian wallrock minerals,\nbut also appears to require contamination by more basic exotic\n\n'
