NASA's Earth Sciences suite of Earth observing instruments are now providing improved observations science, data, and advanced technologies about the Earth's land, atmosphere, and oceans. These new space-based resources are being combined with other agency and university resources, data integration and fusion technologies, geographic information systems (GIS), and the spectrum of tools available from the public health community, making it possible to better understand how the environment and climate are linked to specific diseases, to improve outbreak prediction, and to minimize disease risk. This presentation is an overview of NASA's tools, capabilities, and research advances in this initiative.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20010045818, "endDate": "2001-02-28T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "Department of Defense Pest Management Workshop", "location": "Jacksonville, FL", "id": "59be33195e8244a7a8c514b084eab81f", "startDate": "2001-02-26T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20010045818, "id": "3fa01526ea504ff0835fe88fdc86b504", "publicationDate": "2001-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
