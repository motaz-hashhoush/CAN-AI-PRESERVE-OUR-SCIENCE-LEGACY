This was a joint project between the United States and Russia. Personnel from the NASA Lewis Research Center, General Electric Aircraft Engines, Pratt & Whitney, the Tupolev Design Bureau, and EBP Aircraft LTD worked together as a team to overcome the many technical and cultural challenges. The objective was to obtain large scale inlet data that could be used in the development of a supersonic inlet system for a future High Speed Civil Transport (HSCT). The-first experiment studied the impact of typical inlet structures that have trailing edges in close proximity to the inlet/engine interface plane on the flow characteristics at that plane. The inlet structure simulated the subsonic diffuser of a supersonic inlet using a bifurcated splitter design. The centerbody maximum diameter was designed to permit choking and slightly supercritical operation. The second experiment measured the reflective characteristics of the engine face to incoming perturbations of pressure amplitude. The basic test rig from the first experiment was used with a longer spacer equipped with fast actuated doors. All the objectives set forth at the beginning of the project were met.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 19970025571, "endDate": "1997-07-09T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Society for Electrical Engineers", "location": "United States"}}, "meetingId": "d6781c8fdc8e4d5fb412ce6e62db8dd0", "id": "f91941f6e6b041a19b2aa41068303d3d"}, {"meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Society of Mechanical Engineers", "location": "New York, NY United States"}}, "meetingId": "d6781c8fdc8e4d5fb412ce6e62db8dd0", "id": "b3da187abbbf4bc9bcb30da6ebd55c6f"}, {"meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Inst. of Aeronautics and Astronautics", "location": "New York, NY United States"}}, "meetingId": "d6781c8fdc8e4d5fb412ce6e62db8dd0", "id": "c900b295740d463c8d0823ef3cb28fb3"}, {"meta": {"organization": {"name": "Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.", "location": "New York, NY United States"}}, "meetingId": "d6781c8fdc8e4d5fb412ce6e62db8dd0", "id": "64e036e889144575bdb486384ac9fe1d"}], "name": "Joint Propulsion Conference and Exhibit", "location": "Seattle, WA", "id": "d6781c8fdc8e4d5fb412ce6e62db8dd0", "startDate": "1997-07-06T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 19970025571, "id": "8b367a0789bb494eb05773b96bb970a2", "publicationDate": "1997-06-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19970025571.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19970025571/downloads/19970025571.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19970025571/downloads/19970025571.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19970025571/downloads/19970025571.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
