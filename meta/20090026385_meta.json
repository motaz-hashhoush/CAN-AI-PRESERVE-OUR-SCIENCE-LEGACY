Included are views of the takeoff, and descent on to Mars. The science objective of these missions are to determine the water, climate, and geologic history of two sites on Mars where evidence has been preserved for past and persistent liquid water activity that may have supported biotic or pre-biotic processes. There are also shots of the Athena Science Payload with views of the instrumentation. Also presented are graphs showing Mossbauer Spectra of varions martian rocks.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20090026385, "name": "Colloque de Physique, Universite de Neuchatel", "location": "Neuchatel", "id": "38139b3e650647f1bc7b1534fbd1dffd", "startDate": "2006-01-23T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20090026385, "id": "9594c0fa56f44663a853faa1cfe7f122", "publicationDate": "2006-01-23T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
