During FY-86 and 87, the NASA SP-100 Advanced Technology Program was devised to maintain the momentum of promising technology advancement efforts started during Phase 1 of SP-100 and to strengthen, in key areas, the chances for successful development and growth capability of space nuclear reactor power systems for future space applications. In FY-88, the Advanced Technology Program was incorporated into NASA's new Civil Space Technology Initiative (CSTI). The CSTI Program was established to provide the foundation for technology development in automation and robotics, information, propulsion, and power. The CSTI High Capacity Power Program builds on the technology efforts of the SP-100 program, incorporates the previous NASA SP-100 Advanced Technology project, and provides a bridge to NASA Project Pathfinder. The elements of CSTI High Capacity Power development include Conversion Systems, Thermal Management, Power Management, System Diagnostics, and Environmental Interactions. Technology advancement in all areas, including materials, is required to assure the high reliability and 7 to 10 year lifetime demanded for future space nuclear power systems. The overall program will develop and demonstrate the technology base required to provide a wide range of modular power systems as well as allowing mission independence from solar and orbital attitude requirements. Several recent advancements in CSTI High Capacity power development will be discussed.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 19890015911, "endDate": "1989-08-11T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "IEEE"}}, "meetingId": "6a108ce082d84553919dd32ef356ec11", "id": "49f068136c5844a588632a86c30e16ee"}, {"meta": {"organization": {"name": "ASME"}}, "meetingId": "6a108ce082d84553919dd32ef356ec11", "id": "7dcfc7b660da4ddab8a9089ee9b89d96"}, {"meta": {"organization": {"name": "ANS"}}, "meetingId": "6a108ce082d84553919dd32ef356ec11", "id": "af97afea14934fd7823926f1c886ef2c"}, {"meta": {"organization": {"name": "ACS"}}, "meetingId": "6a108ce082d84553919dd32ef356ec11", "id": "b539cc67253e4397b5de893ab17b3336"}, {"meta": {"organization": {"name": "AIChE"}}, "meetingId": "6a108ce082d84553919dd32ef356ec11", "id": "cdfb050eec624462bea560985c3394df"}, {"meta": {"organization": {"name": "SAE"}}, "meetingId": "6a108ce082d84553919dd32ef356ec11", "id": "3047a5216c3049319f58034820e0bbb2"}, {"meta": {"organization": {"name": "AIAA"}}, "meetingId": "6a108ce082d84553919dd32ef356ec11", "id": "4c9822acb2234b0abc639b987531d5e4"}], "name": "Intersociety Energy Conversion Engineering Conference", "location": "Washington, DC", "id": "6a108ce082d84553919dd32ef356ec11", "startDate": "1989-08-06T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 19890015911, "id": "dc009401b7e04453b44b18aca04739e5", "publicationDate": "1989-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19890015911.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19890015911/downloads/19890015911.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19890015911/downloads/19890015911.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19890015911/downloads/19890015911.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
