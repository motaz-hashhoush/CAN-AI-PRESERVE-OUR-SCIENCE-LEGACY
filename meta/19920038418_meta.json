All of the events are found to be associated with high speed solar wind streams led by collisionless shocks. The high speed streams are clearly related to identifiable solar flares. It is found that: (1) it is the extreme values of the southward interplanetary magnetic fields rather than solar wind speeds that are the primary causes of great magnetic storms, (2) shocked and draped sheath fields preceding the driver gas (magnetic cloud) are at least as effective in causing the onset of great magnetic storms (3 of 5 events) as the strong fields within the driver gas itself, and (3) precursor southward fields ahead of the high speed streams allow the shock compression mechanism (item 2) to be particularly geoeffective.", "title": "Great magnetic storms", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-15T14:09:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19920038418, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Tsurutani, Bruce T."}, "organization": {"name": "Jet Propulsion Lab., California Inst. of Tech.", "location": "Pasadena, CA, United States"}}, "id": "6af22f1a0d234d62968ea434bf6052f8"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19920038418, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Lee, Yen T."}, "organization": {"name": "JPL", "location": "Pasadena, CA, United States"}}, "id": "cf491f2433fc4cb484d785eda3ba2f9c"}, {"sequence": 2, "submissionId": 19920038418, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Gonzalez, Walter D."}, "organization": {"name": "Instituto de Pesquisas", "location": "Sao Jose  dos Campos, Brazil"}}, "id": "9d904dccf97b4c7f8dac9bcbbd94aca7"}, {"sequence": 3, "submissionId": 19920038418, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Tang, Frances"}, "organization": {"name": "California Institute of Technology", "location": "Pasadena, United States"}}, "id": "a067f3b8aac44f45a9b021e0b3aa79fe"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Reprint (Version printed in journal)", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-19T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19920038418, "publications": [{"volume": "19", "submissionId": 19920038418, "issn": "0094-8276", "id": "b24ccac9385c4537aadf47d2420221e9", "publicationName": "Geophysical Research Letters", "publicationDate": "1992-01-03T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
