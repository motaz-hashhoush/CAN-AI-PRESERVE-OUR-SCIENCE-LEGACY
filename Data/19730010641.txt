THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN\n\nPROCESSING OF ERTS-1\nMULTISPECTRAL DATA OF INDIA\n\n1.0\n\nINTRODUCTION\nIn the fall of 1972, the Environmental Research Institute of Michigan\n\n(then Willow Run Laboratories of the University of Michigan) undertook\ncomputer processing of ERTS-1 multispectral scanner data of India.\n\nThe\n\nprocessing was performed to demonstrate that useful pattern recognition\ncould be performed on data that had first been tape recorded in the\nsatellite, then transmitted to the ground.\n\nA second goal was to attempt\n\nto generate land use maps of an area with sizably different cultural practices\nfrom those found in the United States.\n\n2.0\n\nAREA SELECTED FOR STUDY\nThe first step in processing was to obtain imagery from the EROS Sioux\n\nFalls Data Center.\n\nThe image sets were-then examined to get a first look at\n\ndata quality, to select cloud free data for analysis, and to select an area\ngenerally familiar to Dr. Sharma.\n\nThis latter requirement was important,\n\nsince at least a general knowledge of land use practices would be required\nfor subsequent digital computer processing.\nAfter considerable deliberation, a portion of ERTS frame\nwas selected for analysis.\nshown in Figure 1.\n\n1043-04562\n\nThe frame, with intensive study area outlined, is\n\nThe map of Figure 2 shows the area of the frame and the\n\nintensive study area.\n\nFigure 1 shows the low, generally humid area of north-\n\nwestern India just west of Delhi.\n\nThe bright area to the upper right of the\n\nframe is the foothills of the Himalaya Mountains.\n\nThese mountains appear,\n\nLEqIM\n\nFORMERLY WILLOW RUN LABORATORIES, THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN\n\nt\n-- ,o .th\n\nN..Z:~,.\n\n, eqhl~iput\n.\n/\n\nB \'14\n\nLDJ;\n\n*,\n\n,\n\n.\n\nlf\n\n*\n\n(idrAmril.~3I-Paha\n\naTs\n\n_\n\n,~, -. ~~ ~ ~ ~ ,\'-..puN-,^g\nI\n9U,:-...yars~,,,,>s#,K4-,\na..4at\n,u Khnuu\'iRllhflF.\ni\n.\n\nKPo,\n\n.k\n\nO~~iilol\nE3anpu\nork\nKarn\nihnVI~rh.Ijr\n\n21Kc\n\n\xc2\xb7a1 - -\' Id~id.l ,*\'-,Yhe.\n,\n\nSHO\n\n.\'\n\n-ceei\nr\n\n\'\n\nOF\nW\nr__ LOA\n\nI 104-0 .\nR\na,\n\n.~~~f\n\n4562\'\nh\n\nBijnor\nIF~~\n\n.\n\nk~DELHI\nS.\n\n\xc2\xb7ahia.\'\xc2\xb7,\n\n1:6000000MA\nOFenl\n\n.eerut\n\n.\n\nbt..J\n\n:\n\n\' Lint\n_\n\n\xc2\xb7\n\nNi\n\n~~~~~~~Kit~W\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~,.\n\nORTHWETRN\nrhINDIAs\n,r=\'\n. .~~~~~~a\n\nFIGURE 2\n1:6,000,000 MAP OF NORTHWESTERN INDIA\nSHOWING LOCATION OF FRAME 1043-04562\n\nRIM\n\nFORMERLY WILLOW RUN LABORATORIES.

Then a map of band MSS-5 was prepared to\nassist in locating training sets for further digital analysis.\n\nThis map was\n\nfound useful for locating two different categories of forest, two different\ntypes of agriculture, two different bare soil types, and the sand dunes.\nWater training sets for further analysis were easily located on graymaps of\nband MSS-7 made of a small portion of the intensive study area data.\nSeveral samples of each class to be recognized were selected, and spectral\nsignatures obtained.\n\nBy selecting samples of each class, the range of intra-\n\nclass variability can be more precisely delineated.\n\nSpectral signatures of\n\nthe individual samples may then be combined to yield a close approximation to\nthe spectral signature of the class to be recognized.\n\nAt the signature analysis\n\nM\'RIM\nl_;\n.l\nI\n\n.\n\nFORMERLY WILLOW RUN LABORATORIES.
