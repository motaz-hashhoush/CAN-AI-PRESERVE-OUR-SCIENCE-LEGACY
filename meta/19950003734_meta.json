The geometric structure, force constants and binding energies of Cr(C0)6 and Cr(CO)5 are computed using large basis sets and high levels of electron correlation. The molecule 04(+) is studied, using large basis sets and high levels of electron correlation, including the CASSCF, CASSI and CASPT2 methods. Binding energies, geometries and frequencies are computed. Symmetry breaking is a particular problem for the antisymmetric stretch, which is addressed using the CASSI method. The symmetry breaking problem in 04(+) has also been studied using the Brueckner coupled cluster method. This gives results in good agreement with CASSI. A multi-region numerical integration scheme is investigated for use in Density Functional Calculations. This scheme is found to give comparable results to a widely used scheme based on the Euler-Maclaurin technique.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19950003734, "id": "51ab5594efdb4faba0561627f5eef42c", "publicationDate": "1994-07-22T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19950003734.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19950003734/downloads/19950003734.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19950003734/downloads/19950003734.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19950003734/downloads/19950003734.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
