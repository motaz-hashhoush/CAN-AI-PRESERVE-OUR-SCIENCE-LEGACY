The team is working well together on analysis of ACS observations and supporting data from other satellites and from ground-based observations. Many important papers have been published or submitted, spanning science from observations of newly discovered debris disks around young stars, to the characterization of galaxy clusters at half the age of the Universe, to observations of proto-clusters with ages of approx. 2 billion years, to searches for galaxies forming within the first billion years after the birth of the universe. One important milestone during the year was the annual team meeting during September. The meeting, organized and led by Holland and Garth, produced a plan for analysis of ACS observations during the coming year, and a plan for obtaining supporting observations with large ground-based telescopes.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 20040191382, "id": "0d98035c9ffa40d38b0327366dd1b96d", "publicationDate": "2004-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20040191382.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20040191382/downloads/20040191382.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20040191382/downloads/20040191382.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20040191382/downloads/20040191382.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
