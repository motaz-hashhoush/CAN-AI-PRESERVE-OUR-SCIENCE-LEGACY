b'Synthetic vision enhanced surface operations and flight procedures\nrehearsal tool\nJarvis (Trey) J Arthur* III, Lawrence J. Prinzel III, Steven P. Williams, and Lynda J. Kramer\nNASA Langley Research Center, Hampton, VA 23681-2199\nABSTRACT\nLimited visibility has been cited as predominant causal factor for both Controlled-Flight-Into-Terrain (CFIT) and\nrunway incursion accidents. NASA is conducting research and development of Synthetic Vision Systems (SVS)\ntechnologies which may potentially mitigate low visibility conditions as a causal factor to these accidents while\nreplicating the operational benefits of clear day flight operations, regardless of the actual outside visibility condition.\nTwo experimental evaluation studies were performed to determine the efficacy of two concepts: 1) head-worn display\napplication of SVS technology to enhance transport aircraft surface operations, and 2) three-dimensional SVS electronic\nflight bag display concept for flight plan preview, mission rehearsal and controller-pilot data link communications\ninterface of flight procedures. In the surface operation study, pilots evaluated two display devices and four display\nmodes during taxi under unlimited and CAT II visibility conditions. In the mission rehearsal study, pilots flew\napproaches and departures in an operationally-challenged airport environment, including CFIT scenarios. Performance\nusing the SVS concepts was compared to traditional baseline displays with paper charts only or EFB information. In\ngeneral, the studies evince the significant situation awareness and enhanced operational capabilities afforded from these\nadvanced SVS display concepts. The experimental results and conclusions from these studies are discussed along with\nfuture directions.\nKeywords: Synthetic Vision, Head-Worn Displays, Helmet-Mounted Displays, Surface Operations, Electronic Flight\nBag, Mission Rehearsal\n1. INTRODUCTION\nThe Integrated Intelligent Flight Deck Technologies (IIFDT) project, under NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Aviation Safety Program (AvSP),\nis comprised of a multi-disciplinary research effort to develop flight deck technologies that mitigate operator-,\nautomation-, and environment-induced hazards. Towards this objective, IIFDT is developing crew/vehicle interface\ntechnologies that reduce the risk of pilot error, improve aircraft safety for current and future civilian and military\naircraft, and proactively overcome aircraft safety barriers that would otherwise constrain the full realization of the next\ngeneration air transportation system (NGATS). Part of this research effort involves the use of synthetic and enhanced\nvision systems and advanced display media as enabling crew-vehicle interface technologies to meet these safety\nchallenges.\n1.1. HUD limitations\nExperiments and flight tests have shown that a Head-Up Display (HUD) can be effectively enhanced with Synthetic\nVision1,2,4. Additionally, NASA LaRC\xe2\x80\x99s Runway Incursion Prevention System (RIPS)7 and NASA Ames\xe2\x80\x99s Taxiway\nNavigation and Situation Awareness (T-NASA) system8,9,10,11 conducted several flight and simulation experiments\nevaluating cockpit display technology to enable improved and safer surface operations. Both the RIPS and T-NASA\nconcepts used a HUD and a head down display including an electronic moving map (EMM). While great success in\nground operations was demonstrated with a HUD, the research noted that two of major HUD limitations being in\nground operations are their monochrome form and a limited, fixed field of regard. A monochromatic display has the\ninherent problem of being unable to use color for information decluttering and information cuing. Coupled with a\nlimited field of regard, the display area of a HUD must be carefully designed to provide the pilot with enough\ninformation without saturating the display with information clutter.\n*Trey.Arthur@nasa.gov, NASA LaRC, 24 W Taylor Street, Hampton, VA 23681, phone 1 757 864 6609\n\n1.2. Head-worn displays (HWD)\nAdvances in display devices (e.g., electronic flight bags, head-worn devices) have been studied by NASA researchers as\nan alternate and practical method for delivering SVS concepts to the cockpit. HWDs are small, light weight full color\ndisplay devices that can be worn on the head without significant encumbrance (Fig. 1). By coupling the HWD with a\nhead tracker, unlimited field-of-regard can be realized. Unlike fixed field of view (FOV) sensors, the camera position\nand orientation for Synthetic Vision can be defined via software; thus, an unlimited field-of-regard is achieved since the\nSynthetic Vision scene is viewable from any virtual camera angle.\nThe advantages of the full color, Head Tracked \xe2\x80\x93 Head Worn Display (HT-HWD) can directly address the HUD\nlimitations shown in RIPS and T-NASA testing. As such, a study was conducted to determine the efficacy of a HTHWD in a taxiing task in a part-task simulator. In addition, the study was used to obtain pilot comments on the concept\nand future enhancements required for using a HT-HWD for surface operations.\n\nFigure 1: A Synthetic Vision enhanced HWD with a head tracker has unlimited field of regard.\n\n1.3. Electronic Flight Bags (EFB)\nAnother approach envisioned by NASA is to enhance Electronic Flight Bags (EFB) with Synthetic Vision technology.\nEFBs are being offered by a variety of vendors as a means to eliminate paper in the cockpit and do general computing\ntasks such as airplane performance calculations12,13. The first evolution of EFBs consisted of scanning in current paper\ncharts. More advanced versions of these EFBs contain a moving ownship symbol or map to enhance the pilot\xe2\x80\x99s\nsituational awareness (SA) (e.g., commercially-available Class 2 EFBs present ownship position information on the\nairport surface). The impetus for the introduction of EFBs is the significant reduction in the weight of paper that pilots\nhave to carry with them which can weigh upwards of 77lbs (e.g., 777-200). Additional applications are continually\nevolving such as the capability to perform performance calculations on the flight deck which has been shown to\nincrease gross takeoff weight and substantially reduce engine wear. Therefore, EFBs are likely to increase in\nprevalence and, as a consequence, more and more features and functionality will be introduced. Because of advances in\ncomputer technology, 3-dimensional (3-D) graphical EFBs are now possible. Therefore, current prototype concepts are\nbeing studied by NASA LaRC that would leverage Synthetic Vision System (SVS) technologies to benefit aviation\nsafety.\n\nFigure 2: Paper charts (left), typical Electronic Flight Bag (middle) and the NASA-developed Mission Rehearsal Tool (right).\n\nAlthough an experienced pilot is quite familiar the paper format, an electronic version that merely replicates paper\ninformation is unlikely to significantly increase safety; conversely, studies suggest that electronic charts may be harder\nto read and use13,14. Furthermore, while some vendors are pursuing the safety benefits of EFBs (e.g., enhancing surface\nawareness) the tremendous potential of EFBs beyond the more obvious applications (e.g., video surveillance,\nperformance calculations, electronic charts and manuals) have yet to be researched particularly with recent advances in\n3-D graphical displays and Synthetic Vision technology. Research at NASA LaRC is focusing on development of EFBs\nto enhancing aviation safety. Figure 2 shows the progression of paper charts to \xe2\x80\x9ce-paper\xe2\x80\x9d and the NASA-developed\nMission Rehearsal Tool (MRT), described below.\n1.4. NASA Mission Rehearsal Tool (MRT)\nA significant benefit of presenting terrain information in the cockpit is the potential mitigation, or prevention, of\ncontrolled-flight-into-terrain (CFIT). Previous NASA research15 has shown that an egocentric PFD with SVS can\nsignificantly reduce the potential for CFITs compared to the state-of-the-art available today in terrain alerting and\nwarning systems (i.e., Terrain Awareness and Warning System (TAWS) and Vertical Situation Displays). These results\nwere confirmed and extended16 by demonstrating that the addition of an exo-centric navigation display, that provided\npilots with perspective modes which support motion parallax of terrain information, significantly enhanced situation\nawareness and greatly increased safety margins for various CFIT situations.\nA key finding from those studies was that a display that could allow pilots to rehearse and preview flight path\ninformation and ATC clearances in relation to 3-D terrain information may significantly enhance the tremendous\npotential of SVS to proactively, in contrast to reactively (i.e., responding to TAWS alerts), prevent flight crews from\ngetting into potential CFIT situations. The preview capability would enable flight crews to develop and refine their\nmental model well before any possibility of CFITs could present themselves. Because of the additional safety benefit\nthis would provide, NASA has been evaluating such a capability through the use of SVS technology and EFB displays \xe2\x80\x93\ncalled the \xe2\x80\x9cMission Rehearsal Tool\xe2\x80\x9d or MRT.\nThe NASA MRT is envisioned as an enhancement to current EFBs by providing an interactive 3-D view. While a\nmoving ownship overlaid on electronic charts is available as part of the NASA MRT concept, the planned flight path\nmay also be viewed from various orientations to provide improved path and terrain awareness via graphical 2dimensional (2-D) or 3-D perspective display formats. By coupling the path with a terrain database, uncompromising\nterrain awareness relative to the path and ownship is provided. In addition, missed approaches, path deviations, and any\nnavigational path can be reviewed and rehearsed before performing the actual task. By rehearsing a particular mission,\n\ncheck list items can be reviewed terrain awareness can be highlighted and missed approach procedures can be discussed\nby the flight crew. Further, as Controller Pilot Data Linked Communications (CPDLC) progresses in the industry, MRT\noffers an ideal platform from which data-linked path, flight plan changes, and Air Traffic Control requests can be\ndisplayed. It is envisioned that the proactive nature of MRT will create an intuitive means of ensuring SA among the\nflight crew in present and future air space environments.\nThe primary objective of the NASA research on EFBs is to mitigate currently witnessed problems on the flight deck and\nto prepare for technologies to support emerging operating concepts for the next generation air transportation system,\nsuch as equivalent visual operations. Today, flight management systems (FMS) transform and display stored FMS data,\nsensors information and programmed/stored flight plans with only ownship information and minimal symbology\ndepictions, relegated to airport symbology, NAVAIDs, etc. Pilots currently have to mentally rehearse, memorize, and\nthen translate that mental model using a plan view mode of 2-D ND information that presents little or no correlating\nsymbology to FAA-approved and airline company charts that specifically define what the flight crew must do for a\nparticular procedure.\nMRT attempts to overcome these limitations by blending existing and new technologies together to form a 3-D\nexocentric display. This interactive display creates an immersive display of terrain; current, and predicted flight paths.\nThe displays show planned and actual flight paths, obstacles, approach, en route, other chart symbologies, and company\n(and FAA) procedures. The MRT also is designed to allow the pilot to rehearse and preview loaded FMS paths,\nanticipated changes to aircraft routes, new and unfamiliar procedures, etc in an intuitive, 3-D view with full control of\nperspective. By providing a real-time depiction of where the aircraft is in relation to significant terrain on approach and\ndeparture with preview capability, MRT may provide an enabling technology for safe realization of emerging 4-D\nRequired Navigation Performance (RNP) and CPDLC interface functionality.\n1.5. Experimental studies\nTwo part-task experimental studies were conducted to determine the efficacy of using HWDs to enhance taxi operations\nand EFBs for enhancing approach and departure operations.\nIn the first experiment, full-color HWD display concepts were evaluated in surface operations to address previously\nwitnessed display technology limitations. Previous research has shown that a HUD can significantly enhance SA for\nsurface operations; however, due to the HUD\xe2\x80\x99s fixed field-of-regard and limited FOV, intuitively portraying turns on\nthe HUD can be difficult10. Further, information clutter is a driving constraint for the monochromatic HUD. Though\nEFBs are emerging for surface operations, current regulations require the use of paper charts and Class 2 moving map\nEFBs which do not mitigate many issues in today\xe2\x80\x99s complex surface operations. (For an unfamiliar airport, a complex\nairfield can make taxiing a challenging task for the pilot10).\nSecond, an additional experimental study was conducted to determine the efficacy of the NASA-developed EFB known\nas the MRT. The purpose of the study was to conduct a proof-of-concept and evaluation of presenting 3-D information\non an EFB. The objective was to collect data that will enable further development and enhancement of the concept to\nprepare for a high fidelity simulation experiment. Additionally, the study was designed to supplement past research on\nSVS focused on how the technology can mitigate or even eliminate CFITs. Therefore, pilots were exposed to nominal\nand off-nominal situations designed to elicit pilot feedback and usability assessment while also providing a scientific\nmethodology to evaluate the potential of the MRT display concept for prevention of CFITs.\n1.5.1. Simulation facility\nBoth studies was conducted in the Visual Imaging Simulator for Transport Aircraft Systems (VISTAS) III part-task\nsimulator at the NASA LaRC (Fig. 3). VISTAS III is a single pilot fixed-base simulator consisting of a 144 degree by\n30 degree out the window visual, a large field HDD, and pilot input controls. The simulated aircraft in VISTAS III was\na Boeing 757.\n\nFigure 3: VISTAS III part-task simulator.\n\n2. EXPERIMENT ONE: HEAD WORN DISPLAYS\n2.1. Methodology\nFor the HT-HWD usability study, two HWD devices were used: 1) 800H x 600V pixel, full color display with optional\nsee-through capability; and, 2) a glasses-mounted, full color 640H x 480V pixel, non-see through display. An optical\nhead tracker provided the head orientation data. The pilot controls were a tiller, throttles, and differential toe brakes.\nThe pilot interacted with the system via a voice recognition system (VRS). The VRS was not a requirement for the\nevaluation of HWD technology but provided an expedient way to allow pilot interaction. A total of six VRS commands\nwere used to change the display modes and change display range.\n2.1.1. Evaluation pilots\nEight pilots participated in the experiment. The pilots consisted of 6 commercial pilots and 2 test pilots. Of the six\ncommercial pilots, 2 were captains and 4 were first officers. The 6 commercial pilots had an average of over 13,000\nflight hours. The subjects were given a 30-minute briefing to explain the display concepts and the evaluation tasks.\nAfter the briefing, a 1 hour training session was conducted to familiarize the subjects with the VISTAS III simulator, the\nHWD devices, and the piloting task. Following training, 2.5 hours of data collection was conducted. The total time for\na subject was approximately 4 hours.\n2.1.2. HWD evaluation task\nPilots conducted taxi operations at Reno, NV (FAA identifier: RNO) based on simulated data-link taxi clearances. The\nHWD device, the display concept, and weather were varied. Pilots were instructed to taxi at a speed they thought\nappropriate for the task. Two taxi routes were used in the study: 1) a runway to gate route, and 2) a gate to runway\nroute. The runway to gate taxi route was to exit Runway 16R via November taxiway, turn onto Bravo taxiway, and turn\non the Golf taxiway proceeding to the gate. The gate to runway route was to taxi from the Mercury Aviation Center\napron onto the Charlie taxiway, cross Runway 25 to Papa, and hold short of Runway 34L. The weather state for the out\nthe window scene was varied between clear day with unlimited visibility and fog, 1000 foot runway visibility range\n(RVR).\n2.1.3. HWD conditions\nThree different display conditions were used: 1) a paper chart, 2) an advanced EFB type display consisting of a 2-D\ntrack up moving map with the cleared taxi route and ownship symbol and 3) HWD concepts.\n\nFor the HWD concepts, two HWD devices were tested. The first HWD was nominally see-through with 800x600 pixel\nresolution. The display could also be made non-see-through by closing an opaque door on the display. The FOV was\napproximately 23\xcb\x9a horizontal by 16.5\xcb\x9a vertical. The second HWD had 640x480 pixel resolution with an approximate\nFOV of 14\xcb\x9a horizontal by 10.4\xcb\x9a vertical and was non-see-through.\nFor each HWD, there were two display concepts tested (Fig. 4): 1) Single Mode and 2) Multi-Mode. Single Mode\nconsisted of a 2-D moving map, plan view display. This concept does not require head tracking. The Multi-Mode\ndisplay allowed the pilot to choose between 4 different display modes: 1) a text display of the taxi clearance, 2) a 2-D\nmoving map (the Single-Mode presentation), 3) a zoomed-in 2-D moving map for precision surface guidance and 4) a\n3-D perspective display.\nThe 3-D perspective display was evaluated with and without head-tracking. For the head-tracked condition, the FOV\npresented on the display corresponded with that of the display device (i.e., it was conformal). For the non-head-tracked\ncase, two FOVs were tested: 1) the FOV of the display device (i.e., the same FOV as conformal, but non-head-tracked);\nand, 2) a fixed field-of-regard approximately the same as a HUD FOV (30\xcb\x9a horizontal by 24\xcb\x9a vertical).\n\nFigure 4: The four display modes for the Multi-Mode surface operations concept.\nIn the Single Mode case, only the 2-D moving map concept was displayed to the pilot.\n\nThe usability evaluation was conducted in 4 blocks. For each of the four blocks, the weather (clear or 1000 foot RVR)\nand display mode (Multi-Mode and Single Mode) were held constant. For Block 1, the outside weather was clear and\nunlimited visibility and the display mode was pilot-selectable (Multi-Mode). Block 2 was that same as Block 1,\nhowever, the outside weather was 1000 foot RVR. The taxi clearance for all of the data runs in Blocks 1 & 2 was the\nrunway-to-gate route described above. For Blocks 3 and 4, the display concept was held constant to the Single Mode\npresentation. For Block 3, the weather was clear and unlimited visibility; while for Block 4, the outside weather was set\nto 1000 foot RVR. In Single Mode, there was neither head tracking nor any FOV variations; thus, the only variation\nwas the HWD display device (800x600 pixel open, closed and the 640x480 pixel display). The taxi clearance for all\ndata runs in Blocks 3 & 4 was the gate-to-runway route described above.\n2.2. HWD results\nThe study was used to confirm the efficacy and acceptance of using a HWD for surface operations. As such, the results\nof the HWD usability study were principally subjective. The pilot comments were sought to improve the concepts and\nhelp focus more rigorous follow-on research. Figure 5 shows the twelve HWD variations tested.\n\nFigure 5: Display conditions for the HWD usability study.\n\n2.2.1. Multi-Mode display concept with clear weather (Block 1)\nUsing the Friedman test, the rank ordering of the display types by the evaluation subjects was significant. The highest\nranked display type was the 800x600 pixel display (open) with a conformal FOV for the 3-D perspective mode and the\nhead tracker on. The lowest ranked display type was the non-head-tracked 800x600 pixel display (closed) with the\nconformal FOV for the 3-D perspective display mode.\n2.2.2. Multi-Mode display concept with 1000 foot RVR weather (Block 2)\nUsing the Friedman test, rank ordering of the display types by the evaluation subjects was again significant. The\nhighest ranked display type was the head-tracked 800x600 pixel display (open) with the conformal FOV. The lowest\nrank display type was the non-head-tracked 800x600 pixel display (closed) with the conformal FOV for the 3-D\nperspective display mode.\n2.2.3. Single Mode display (Blocks 3 & 4)\nRegardless of the visibility condition, pilots ranked the 800x600 pixel display (open) and the 640x480 pixel display\nhigher than the 800x600 pixel display (closed). For unlimited visibility, the rank order was significant. The 800x600\npixel display (open) and the 640x480 pixel display had the same highest ranking of 1.62 and the 800x600 pixel display\n(closed) had the lowest ranking of 2.75. For 1000 foot RVR visibility, the rank order was again significant with the\n\n800x600 pixel display (open) and the 640x480 pixel display having the same highest ranking of 1.5 and the 800x600\npixel display (closed) having the lowest ranking of 3.0.\n2.2.4. SA-SWORD\nAnalysis, using SA-SWORD post-test, showed statistically significant differences across all display types for subjective\nSituation Awareness (SA). There were 3 subsets based on Student-Newman-Keuls (SNK) at \xce\xb1 = 0.05. In this pairedcomparison test, the non-head-tracked display comparison was collapsed. The HUD FOV and Conformal FOV display\nconcepts were treated as one, with the EP assuming the optimal or pilot-preferred FOV.\nThe 800x600 pixel display (closed), Single Mode had significantly less SA than all other display types tested.\nConversely, the 800x600 pixel display (open), Multi-Mode with the conformal FOV for the 3-D perspective display had\nsignificantly higher SA than the following display types: 1) 800x600 pixel display (closed), non-conformal FOV, Single\nMode; 2) 800x600 pixel display (closed), non-conformal FOV, Multi-Mode; 3) 640x480 pixel display, non-conformal\nFOV, Multi-Mode; 4) 640x480 pixel display, non-conformal, Single Mode but no significant differences with the\nfollowing display types: 1) 800x600 pixel display (open), non-conformal, Single Mode; 2) 640x480 pixel display,\nconformal, Multi-Mode; 3) 800x600 pixel display (closed), conformal, Multi-Mode; and 4) 800x600 pixel display\n(open), non conformal, Multi-Mode.\nA post-test paired comparison questionnaire was conducted in terms of runway taxi/surface situation awareness using\nthe displays tested (pilot-preferred Multi-Mode HWD and pilot-preferred Single Mode HWD) and current/near-term\nairline equipage (paper charts and EFB moving map). The results showed that there were statistically significant SA\ndifferences depending upon display media type. Post-hoc tests show three unique subsets. The pilots\xe2\x80\x99 preferred HWD\nconcept was Multi-Mode as it gave significantly greater surface SA than the three other types (preferred Single Mode,\nEFB moving map, paper charts). Pilots\xe2\x80\x99 ranked the Single Mode as having significantly higher SA than EFB moving\nmap and paper charts. There were no appreciable differences in SA between EFB taxi map and paper charts.\n2.2.5. Workload\nSubject pilots were given a paired comparison questionnaire regarding workload during runway taxi/surface operations\nusing the displays tested (pilot-preferred Multi-Mode HWD and pilot-preferred Single Mode HWD) and current/nearterm airline equipage (paper charts and EFB taxi-map). The results showed that there were statistically significant\nworkload differences depending upon display media type. Post-hoc tests show two unique subsets. Pilots rated paper\ncharts as having significantly greater workload than the other three display media types (pilots\xe2\x80\x99 preferred Multi-Mode,\npilots\xe2\x80\x99 preferred Single Mode, and EFB with moving map). There were no appreciable differences in workload among\nthe pilots\xe2\x80\x99 preferred Multi-Mode, pilots\xe2\x80\x99 preferred Single Mode, and EFB moving map display media types.\n2.2.6. Display media\nAt the end of the test, pilots were asked to rank-order the various display concepts they had seen by preference.\nAnalysis of the data showed that display media type rankings were significant. The pilots\xe2\x80\x99 display media ranking order\nwas Multi-Mode (1.1), Single Mode (1.9), EFB (3.0), and Paper (4.0). For the Multi-Mode concept, pilots were asked\nto rank the 4 modes (Fig. 4). Analysis of the results showed that the Multi-Mode concept rankings were significant.\nThe rank-order results were the 2-D moving map mode (1.8), the 2-D precision guidance mode (2.0), the 3-D\nperspective mode (2.4), and the clearance text mode (3.9).\n2.3. HWD experiment discussion\nExperiment One was designed to demonstrate the efficacy of a head-worn display which provides unlimited field-ofregard Synthetic Vision for surface operations. The results demonstrate that providing pilots with the ability to virtually\nsee well beyond visual range can significantly increase situation awareness and task performance on the airport surface.\nPilots were better able to perform the taxiing evaluation task and reported significantly higher situational awareness\nwith the HMD concepts compared to an electronic moving map or paper charts of the airport environment.\nFurthermore, the study provided tremendous insight into future design and development of head-worn displays,\nincluding hardware considerations and methods for integration of display modes.\n\n2.3.1. HWD hardware considerations\nTwo significant hardware considerations were evinced from the HWD experiment. Nearly all pilots rated the 800x600\npixel display higher because it had higher resolution than the 640x480 display and it was see-through. The higher\nresolution improves the readability of the display especially for text and numbers. This finding is consistent with past\nresearch findings that higher resolution displays are generally preferred by pilots. Additionally, pilots preferred not to\nhave their forward vision blocked even by the small 640x480 pixel display. The see-through capability allowed pilots\nto continue their nominal out the window surveillance of the airport environment during taxi. Also, the see through\ndisplay provided pilots with confidence that the display was aligned with the scene.\n2.3.2. HWD mode integration\nWith regard to display mode integration, pilots reported that the four modes (clearance, 2-D precision guidance, 2-D\nmoving map, and 3-D perspective) each have relative merits in supporting taxi operations. For complex operational\nenvironments, the data-link textual clearance mode was reported to be of significant value in ensuring compliance with\nground instructions. However, this mode would likely not by itself be enough to improve aviation safety. It is only\nwhen combined with the other modes that its potential becomes evident. In fact, this observation was witnessed for\neach of the modes. For example, pilots reported that the 2-D moving map was of substantial benefit but it did not\nprovide them with the precision needed from the 2-D precision guidance. However, the 2-D precision guidance only\nprovided local guidance and they lacked global situation awareness. The 3-D perspective helped give pilots a sense of\nimmersion; that is, the feeling that they were looking outside the cockpit into the real-world. This resulted in high\nsituation awareness but again, pilots felt that the precision and the \xe2\x80\x9cbig picture\xe2\x80\x9d were missing. Therefore, each of the\nmodes contributed something unique, and the display concept was limited in its efficacy only because pilots did not like\nto have to continuously switch between modes to extract the necessary information that each mode provided separately.\nAs a consequence, pilots unanimously stated their preference for a more integrated display that would blend the various\ndisplay modes together to reduce the workload and improve accessibility to display information.\nThese results have highlighted several technology trends which are now being researched to further and fully develop a\nunified, unlimited field-of-regard Synthetic Vision HWD. Many challenges remain, but the potential to significantly\nimprove surface operations using HWD concepts seems clear from these data.\n3. EXPERIMENT TWO: ELECTRONIC FLIGHT BAG\n3.1. Methodology\n3.1.1. Simulation facility\nThe MRT display was mounted in the VISTAS III simulator (Fig. 3). MRT was rendered on a tablet PC with a 1.6 GHz\nPentium M processor, 1 GB of memory and Microsoft Window XP Tablet edition operating system. The MRT\nsoftware was developed in-house by NASA. Interaction with MRT was via a stylus pen. The HDD consisted of an\nARINC Size D (7 square inch display surface) PFD and ND. The PFD was a typical electronic attitude display\nindicator (EADI) presentation with a velocity vector and guidance cue (the \xe2\x80\x9cball\xe2\x80\x9d). The ND was enhanced with Terrain\nAwareness and Warning System (TAWS) and a Vertical Situation Display (VSD) which provided graphical terrain\ndepiction and alerts (Fig. 6).\n\nFigure 6: Baseline PFD and ND displays used for MRT evaluations.\n\n3.1.2. Evaluation pilots\nEight commercial \xe2\x80\x9cglass cockpit\xe2\x80\x9d pilots participated in the MRT usability study. The 8 pilots consisted of five captains\nand three first officers flying for major airlines and had significant line operational experience (> 8000 hours). The\nsubjects were given a 30-minute briefing to explain the overall display concepts, background on EFBs, evaluation tasks,\nand relevant procedural information necessary to conduct the experimental session. After the briefing, pilots were\npresented with an informed consent form followed by a 1.5 hour training session to familiarize the evaluation pilots\nwith the VISTAS III simulator, the MRT display, the e-paper display, and expected piloting tasks. Following training,\n2 hours of data collection was conducted. The total time for a subject was approximately 4 hours.\n3.1.3. Evaluation tasks\nPilots flew two departures (KREMM, Cottonwood-2) and three approaches (FMS-B, LDA25, Circle-To-Land to\nRunway 07) at Eagle-Vail Regional County Airport (FAA Identifier: EGE). During evaluation runs, pilots were given\nsimulated audible ATC calls which were also presented as controller-pilot data link communication messages on the\nMRT display condition. Pilots were instructed that the main focus of the study was to evaluate the MRT display and\nnot path performance. For all runs except two visual arrivals, the weather conditions were fog with 2000 foot visibility\nand light snow falling at the rate of 75 mm/hour. The visual approach was conducted at a simulated late afternoon time\nwith light snow falling.\n3.1.4. CFIT evaluation tasks\nUnknown to the pilots, there were also two CFIT trials presented: an FMS-B approach with an amended clearance that\ndirected the aircraft into terrain and a KREMM departure with incorrect guidance (Fig. 7). The FMS-B scenario began\nat 13,100 MSL with an ATC clearance to conduct the nominal approach procedure to Runway 25. Before reaching the\ninitial approach fix of MCCOY, the pilot was given an amended clearance to fly direct to BEVEY. The clearance also\nincluded instructions to descend to and maintain 11,000 MSL. This course put the aircraft below terrain with peaks at\n11,653 MSL. The CFIT KREMM departure from Runway 07 was set-up by commanding a 052\xcb\x9a heading off of the\nSXW VOR instead of the nominal 059\xcb\x9a radial which resulted in a course that came within 100 feet AGL of terrain. In\naddition, the engine-out circling procedure was not done in either training or evaluation trials even though single engine\npower was simulated. Pilots saw each CFIT scenario when flying with either the MRT or e-paper display condition as\nrandomly assigned across pilots. For all display conditions, TAWS and VSD presented terrain alerts to the pilots.\n\nFigure 7: Nominal and CFIT KREMM departure (left) and FMS-B en-route (right) evaluation tasks.\n\n3.1.5. Evaluation display conditions\nThree display conditions were used in the study: 1) paper charts, 2) e-paper which consisted of an electronically\nscanned chart with ownship symbol showing current position, and 3) the MRT. The paper charts condition represented\na baseline for comparison and consisted of published approach and departure procedures and specialized major airline\ncompany procedural technique guides and charts. The e-paper condition consisted of an electronic scan of the charts\nused in the paper charts condition with the addition of a moving ownship symbol (left image in Fig. 8). Finally, the\nMRT display (Figure 8-10) consisted of the e-paper display concepts (as a pilot-selectable mode option) but also\npresented a 2-D plan view of the 3-D terrain database. The 2-D plan view mode is analogous to a ND with a terrain\ndatabase displayed. In addition, the MRT display contained a number of EFB enhancements which were described in\nSection 1.4. For instance, in Figure 8, the middle image of the MRT shows a preview of a data-linked path that goes\ninto the terrain (i.e., the pilot should reject the clearance). Blue dots denote checklist item changes and red spheres are a\nvisual alert that the path is less than 1000 feet AGL. The CPDLC capability of MRT display is shown in Figure 9.\n\nFigure 8: E-paper (left) and the MRT display (middle & right) concept.\n\nWhite dashed\nlines indicate ATC\nclearance path\n\nATC Clearance Box\nFigure 9: CPDLC capability of MRT display.\n\nProcedures/Technique\nGuide Box\nFigure 10: Techniques and procedures capability of MRT display.\n\n3.1.6. Experiment design & procedure\nThe experiment matrix was a randomly assigned 3 display conditions (paper, e-paper, and MRT) by 5 tasks (LDA25,\nFMS-B, Circle-To-Land to runway 07, KREMM departure, Cottonwood-2 departure) by 2 CFIT tasks (en route,\ndeparture) mixed-subjects partially factorial design. All pilots flew the Localizer DME (LDA25) approach to Runway\n25 with all three display conditions. The use of paper charts was to provide a baseline rating for comparison of e-paper\nand MRT to currently available technology onboard Part 121 aircraft today (i.e., paper charts, electronic charts without\nownship). The remaining nominal evaluation tasks (Cottonwood-2 departure, Circle-To-Land to Runway 07) were\nflown with both e-paper and MRT display concepts. During training, pilots flew all five evaluation tasks, including the\nFMS-B approach and KREMM departure, with all display concepts to familiarize and prepare them for the data\ncollection trials. The pilots were not exposed to any CFIT events during training, thus, the FMS-B did not have the\namended clearance causing a CFIT and the KREMM departure was a nominal departure.\nThe experimental trials consisted of three LDA25 approaches (paper, e-paper, MRT), two Circle-To-Land approaches to\nRunway 07 (e-paper, MRT), two Cottonwood-2 departures (e-paper, MRT), an en route CFIT (FMS-B), and a departure\nCFIT (KREMM) for a total of 9 experimental trials. During the experimental trials, the FMS-B approach and KREMM\ndeparture tasks were assigned as a between-subjects factor and pilots were randomly assigned to fly these tasks with\neither the e-paper or MRT display concepts. These evaluation tasks were designed to present a potential CFIT situation\nas described in the section above.\n3.2. NASA MRT results\nAll dependent variables were analyzed using multivariate analyses of variance (MANOVA) and subsequent univariate\nANOVAs based on significant Pillai\xe2\x80\x99s Trace results. Significant main effects were subjected to post-hoc pair-wise least\nsignificant difference tests. An alpha (\xce\xb1) level of 0.05 was used as the criterion for determining significant effects of\nresults. All data was analyzed using Mauchly\xe2\x80\x99s Test of Sphericity and appropriate statistics were used (e.g.,\nGreenhouse-Geisser) when the assumption of sphericity was violated.\nNo significant effects were found for any dependent variable for evaluation task (p > .05) or the interaction of\ndisplay*task (p >.05). Only main effects for display condition are consequently presented. Data was collected for all\nthree display conditions for LDA25 evaluation task only to allow baseline comparisons to e-paper and MRT display\nconditions. The pattern of results between e-paper and MRT displays for the other departure and approach evaluation\ntasks duplicate those found with the LDA25 evaluation task. Therefore, the text describes the findings of data collected\nduring the LDA25 approach to minimize space devoted to similar results reporting. Table 1 presents the results for each\ndependent variable for all three display condition for LDA25 approach task. However, Table 2 presents the combined\nresults for the remaining departure and approach tasks for e-paper and MRT display conditions.\n3.2.1. Situation Awareness\nAn Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) showed a significant effect for display condition, F(2,14) = 12.676, p < .001. Pilots\nrated the MRT display (M = 6.250) significantly higher in situation awareness rating technique17 (SART =\nunderstanding \xe2\x80\x93 {resources \xe2\x80\x93 demand}) compared to either e-paper (p = .048; M = 4.625) or paper charts (p = .002; M =\n3.125) which were also significantly different from each other (p = .020) based on the post-hoc pair-wise least\nsignificant difference test.\n\nTable 1: Statistical results for LDA25 evaluation task comparing all three display concepts.\nMRT Display\n\nSART\nWorkload\nTask Awareness\nTerrain Awareness\nOwnship\nAwareness\nPath Awareness\nATC Awareness\nEase of Use\n\ne-paper\n\nPaper charts\n\nSignificance\n\nPartial\nEtaSquared\n\nObserved Power\n\n6.250\n2.875\n5.875\n6.375\n\n4.625\n2.875\n5.125\n3.750\n\n3.125\n3.500\n4.250\n2.875\n\n.001\n.07\n.001\n.0001\n\n.644\n.313\n.611\n.926\n\n.986\n.514\n.971\n1.00\n\n6.250\n\n4.625\n\n3.750\n\n.0001\n\n.788\n\n1.00\n\n6.250\n6.250\n5.875\n\n4.500\n5.125\n5.125\n\n3.625\n5.000\n4.375\n\n.0001\n.0001\n.01\n\n.739\n.711\n.482\n\n.999\n.998\n.832\n\nTable 2: Statistical results for approach and departure tasks (except LDA 25) comparing e-paper and MRT.\nMRT Display\n\nSART\nWorkload\nTask Awareness\nTerrain Awareness\nOwnship\nAwareness\nPath Awareness\nATC Awareness\nEase of Use\n\ne-paper\n\nF-Value\n(df = 1,7)\n\nSignificance\n\nPartial\nEtaSquared\n\nObserved Power\n\n4.458\n3.00\n5.792\n6.542\n\n4.250\n3.292\n5.167\n4.250\n\n0.228\n1.874\n13.235\n115.710\n\n.647\n.213\n.008\n.0001\n\n.032\n.211\n.654\n.943\n\n.070\n.221\n.875\n1.00\n\n6.375\n\n4.792\n\n.001\n\n.836\n\n.999\n\n6.417\n6.208\n5.958\n\n4.667\n5.125\n5.292\n\n.001\n.001\n.099\n\n.823\n.754\n.340\n\n.998\n.976\n.376\n\n35.592\n32.495\n21.509\n3.613\n\n3.2.2. Terrain awareness\nANOVA results evinced that pilots rated terrain awareness significantly higher for the MRT display (M = 6.375) than\neither the e-paper (p = .0001; M = 3.750) or paper chart (p = .0001; M = 2.875) display conditions, F(2,14) = 87.431, p<\n.0001 which were also significantly different from each other (p = .021) based on the post-hoc pair-wise least significant\ndifference test.\n3.2.3. Workload\nAn ANOVA revealed a non-significant trend for the overall main effect for the modified workload estimation scale\nratings for mental workload, F(2,14) = 3.182, p> .07. Pair-wise comparisons between the conditions did reveal\nsignificant effects between e-paper (M = 2.875) and paper chart (M = 3.50) based on estimated marginal means (mean\ndifference = .625; std. error = .183, p = .011). No differences were found between MRT (M = 2.875) and the other two\ndisplay conditions.\n3.2.4. Task awareness\nThere was a significant main effect for display condition for task awareness, F(2,14) = 10.975, p < .001. Post-hoc least\nsignificant difference test revealed that pilots rated the MRT display (M = 5.875) significantly higher for task awareness\nthan either e-paper (p = .020; M = 5.125) or paper charts (p = .006; M =4.250), and that e-paper was rated significantly\nhigher than paper charts (p = .041).\n\n3.2.5. Ownship position and path awareness\nThere were significant main effects found for display condition for both ownship position estimation, F(2,14) = 26.060,\np <.0001 and path awareness, F(2,14) = 19.863, p<.0001. Overall, post-hoc least significant difference tests showed\nthat pilots provided higher Likert scale ratings for MRT for ownship position (M = 6.250) than for either e-paper (p =\n.001; M = 4.625) or paper chart (p = .001; M = 3.750) which were significantly different from each other (p = .021).\nSimilarly, pilot rated the MRT higher (M = 6.250) for path awareness compared to either e-paper (p = .004; M = 4.50)\nor paper charts (p = .002; M = 3.625) which were also significantly different from each other (p = .021).\n3.2.6. ATC Communications Awareness\nThe results for awareness of ATC communications show a significant main effect between display conditions, F(2,14) =\n17.216, p < .0001. Post-hoc least significant difference tests reveal that pilots rated the MRT display significant higher\nin ATC communication awareness (M = 6.250) than either the e-paper (p = .001; M = 5.125) or paper chart (p = .001;\nM = 5.00) display conditions. There were no significant differences found between e-paper and paper chart display\nconditions (p = .598).\n3.2.7. Ease of Use\nAn ANOVA found a significant main effect for ease of use for display condition, F(2,14) = 6.517, p< .01. Pilots rated\nthe MRT display conditions (M = 5.875) to be significantly easier to use than the paper charts (p = .026; M = 4.375).\nThere was also a significant effect found between e-paper (M = 5.125) and paper charts (p = .048). However, there were\nno differences found between the MRT display condition and e-paper (p = .080).\n3.2.8. CFIT scenario results\nThere were significant differences in how pilots responded to the CFIT situations dependent upon which display\ncondition they were using during the CFIT event. Regardless of CFIT situation, all pilots recognized the potential CFIT\nsituation and none of the eight pilots actually hit terrain. For the e-paper display condition, all four pilots accepted the\nATC-amended clearance during the en route CFIT scenario and did not recognize the impending CFIT until terrain\nalerts appeared on the TAWS and VSD. On average, pilots responded to the CFIT with a vertical \xe2\x80\x9cpull-up\xe2\x80\x9d maneuver\napproximately 70 seconds before terrain impact and avoided terrain an average of 600 ft. In two cases, pilots missed the\nterrain by 128 ft and 223 ft. In contrast, with the MRT display, pilots rejected the ATC clearance because the preview\ncapability clearly showed the amended clearance directed them toward hazardous terrain. Therefore, pilots NEVER\nwere put in a situation in which they had to initiate a terrain avoidance maneuver unlike the pilots flying with the epaper display. The same was true for the KREMM departure CFIT situation. All four pilots with the MRT display\nimmediately recognized the erroneous flight path and did not take-off in contrast to all four pilots with the e-paper that\nrecognized the impending CFIT only after departing and receiving TAWS and VSD alerts. With the e-paper, pilots\nrecognized the CFIT situation approximately 2 nm from terrain impact and avoided terrain by 300 ft or less.\nTo quantify this safety benefit, the location of average detection of potential CFIT for both display conditions are shown\nin Figure 11 during the en route and departure scenarios, respectively. The yellow dots (also labeled Synthetic Vision)\nin Figure 11 represent the average CFIT detection with the MRT concept and the red dots (also labeled E-paper)\nrepresent the average CFIT detection for the e-paper concept. In Figure 12, the left image shows the en-route CFIT\nscenario in the e-paper condition; the right-hand figure shows the MRT display for comparison (though the pilot did not\nhave the MRT for this trial). In Figures 13 and 14, the head-down displays and the e-paper concept, respectively, are\nshown during en-route CFIT situation. The right-hand picture in Figure 14, shows the MRT presentation that the pilots\nwould have seen in both real-time and rehearsal/ preview modes, if they had accepted the same flight plan.\nAfter each CFIT trial, pilots were asked to fill out a questionnaire asking specific questions on a Likert Scale (0 to 7)\nregarding the CFIT scenario they had just experienced. An ANOVA showed that pilots rated their situation awareness\nsignificantly higher with the MRT (M = 7.00) than with the e-paper display (M = 3.875), F(1, 12) = 69.44, p < .0001.\nPilots also rated the amount of time they had to respond and their response to the CFIT situation was significantly faster\nand more proactive (\xe2\x80\x9ccompletely aware and proactive to avoid need for evasive response\xe2\x80\x9d) with the MRT (M= 6.625)\ncompared to e-paper (M = 3.375; \xe2\x80\x9cAware but reactive with barely sufficient time to take evasive response\xe2\x80\x9d). For those\npilots that had the MRT display, they stated that the flight path and CPDLC rehearsal and preview capability added\n\n100% to their situation awareness and significantly enhanced their ability to detect and recognize a potential CFIT\nsituation. In Figure 15, the MRT vividly depicts why the pilots, who had the MRT concept, rejected the ATC amended\nclearance during the en-route CFIT scenario and immediately recognized the erroneous path during the departure CFIT\nscenario, respectively. Similarly, in Figure 16, a snap-shot of the MRT preview of the KREMM departure taken before\nthe run began shows the clear and unambiguous nature of the MRT display for CFIT prevention.\n\nFigure 11: Location of average detection of en-route (right) and departure (left) CFIT.\n\nFigure 12: En-route CFIT example with e-paper (left) and MRT (right).\n\nFigure 13: PFD and ND depicting departure CFIT situation with e-paper.\n\nFigure 14: En-route CFIT example with e-paper (left) and MRT (right).\n\nFigure 15: En-route MRT display upon receiving amended clearance (white dashed lines) and in preview (right).\n\nFigure 16: MRT display during pilot preview of nominal (left) and CFIT KREMM departure path (right).\n\n3.3. Electronic Flight Bag experiment discussion\nThe purpose of Experiment Two was the evaluation of a synthetic vision electronic flight bag display concept compared\nto existing Class III EFBs and paper charts. The focus was on key features that could enhance the potential aviation\nsafety benefits of EFBs. Toward that end, the MRT display was designed to introduce intuitive terrain awareness and\n\nprovide needed functionality targeted at specific safety concerns and operational concepts - both for today and in\nsupport of future operating concepts for the next generation air transportation system. The functionality included\nCPDLC interface technology; graphical depiction of flight path and terrain; preview/rehearsal; flight techniques and\nprocedural memory aids; and 3-D graphical charts.\n3.3.1. Enhancement of Electronic Flight Bags\nThe results of Experiment Two evinced that the MRT is a substantial enhancement over existing electronic flight bags\nby providing pilots with added functionality not currently present with today\xe2\x80\x99s EFBs. Pilots reported significantly\ngreater situation awareness for terrain, ownship position and flight path, task and procedures, and ATC communications\nwithout an increase in mental workload. Although \xe2\x80\x9ce-paper\xe2\x80\x9d with moving ownship was reported to greatly increase\naircraft positional awareness compared to flying with only paper charts, the \xe2\x80\x9ce-paper\xe2\x80\x9d concept only marginally\nenhanced overall situation awareness. Instead, pilots felt that the addition of CPDLC capability combined with 3-D\ngraphical depiction of ATC clearances, terrain, flight path, and aircraft position together with the rehearsal/preview and\ntechnique/procedural memory aids distinctly provided advantages over the e-paper concept alone.\n3.3.2. Prevention of Controlled-Flight-Into-Terrain\nThe finding that MRT was a significant enhancement of electronic flight bags was most evident in the CFIT results.\nEach pilot was exposed to two potential CFIT situations during the experiment: an en-route and departure CFIT. The\nen-route CFIT consisted of an erroneous ATC clearance that put the aircraft on a heading and altitude trajectory that\ncollided with terrain. While all pilots with the e-paper recognized the impending CFIT before impact, the pilots had to\nperform aggressive vertical maneuvers and all reported that they had little time to take evasive response; in other words,\nthe pilots were reactive to the situation and rated their situation awareness low despite having an electronic\ntopographical map showing terrain higher than their cleared altitude. In contrast, pilots experiencing the potential en\nroute CFIT with the MRT had significantly higher situation awareness because they were able to preview the CPDLC\nclearance and see three-dimensionally how flight path intersected the terrain; that is, they were proactive in their\nresponse. The pilots were able to easily recognize the potential CFIT and reply \xe2\x80\x9cunable\xe2\x80\x9d to the ATC clearance because\nof the terrain conflict. This was true as well of the KREMM departure potential CFIT which involved an erroneous\ndeparture guidance path. Pilots with the e-paper narrowly avoided the terrain because they unaware of the terrain until\nthe situation showed itself to be a danger through TAWS and VSD alerts. These reactive alerts only provided the pilots\nwith approximately 60 seconds before impact with terrain to perform an evasive maneuver. The only maneuver\navailable is a pull-up which resulted, on average, in terrain clearance by less than 300 ft AGL. On the other hand, pilots\nwith the MRT recognized the erroneous flight path during preview of the departure path and, consequently, had time to\ncorrect the path before the aircraft even took-off. Together, the results show again the difference in advantage afforded\nto synthetic vision systems compared to baseline displays. The synthetic vision system MRT EFB provides proactive,\nrather than reactive, alerting and awareness for pilots to potential terrain hazards, CFIT avoidance, and flight plan\nchanges.\n4. CONCLUSIONS\nThe experiments revealed numerous future directions to better optimize and develop these concepts. One future\ndirection will involved the integration of an enhanced vision sensor technology with the optimized HWD concept\n(based on the findings of Experiment One). More complex surface operations and geometries (such as at Chicago\nO\xe2\x80\x99Hare International Airport) will be used and compared against existing technologies (such as T-NASA display\nsystem, which incorporates HUD surface ops symbology and a moving map display of information). Another future\ndirection will involve the further enhancement of the MRT display and evaluate a more mature concept in high fidelity,\ntwo-crew simulation experiment for complex operational and terrain-challenged international airline operations.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThe authors would like to acknowledge Randy Bailey and Mike Norman.
