b'Johnson Space Center\n\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration\n\nWorkmanship\nTraining\nSpecial processes require special skills,\nknowledge and experienced application. For\nover 15 years, the NASA Johnson Space\nCenter\xe2\x80\x99s Receiving, Inspection and Test\nFacility (RITF) has provided Workmanship\nStandards compliance training, issuing\nmore than 500 to 800 training completion\ncertificates annually.\nIt is critical that technicians and inspectors\nare trained and that they maintain their\nproficiency to implement the applicable\nstandards and specifications.\nTraining services include \xe2\x80\x9chands-on\xe2\x80\x9d training\nto engineers, technicians, and inspectors\nin the areas of electrostatic discharge\n(ESD), soldering, fiber optics, lithium battery\nhandling, torque and wire safety, and wire\nwrapping.\n\nFiber\nOptic\n\nFIBER OPTIC TERMINATIONS TRAINING / RETRAINING\nInstructors utilize lectures, demonstrations, and student application to develop\nrequired knowledge and skills for fiber optic termination and fusion splicing.\n\nESD\n\nELECTROSTATIC DISCHARGE CONTROL (ESD) TRAINING LEVELS 2 & 3\nInstructors utilize lectures, demonstrations, and student application to develop\nrequired knowledge and skills for Engineers, Operators, Inspectors, Field Engineer\nMaintenance, Stockroom personnel, or any personnel needing access to ESD sensitive\nhardware on a regular basis. Level 2 is a prerequisite for Level 3 training.\n\nSoldering\n\nTHROUGH-HOLE SOLDERING\nInstructors utilize lectures, demonstrations, and student application to develop\nrequired knowledge and skills for fabrication of stranded wire and component lead\ntinning, component mounting and termination.\n\nLIthium\nBattery\n\nLITHIUM BATTERY HANDLING FAMILIARIZATION\nInstructors utilize lectures and demonstrations about the hazards associated with\nlithium batteries.\n\nConformal\nCoating\n\nCONFORMAL COATING & STAKING TRAINING / INSPECTION (POLYMERIC APPLICATION)\nInstructors utilize lectures, demonstrations, and student application to develop\nrequired knowledge and skills for conformal coating and component and wire\nharness staking.\n\nTorque\n& Wire\n\nTORQUE AND SAFETY WIRE INSPECTION\nInstructors utilize lectures, demonstrations, and student application to develop the\nrequired knowledge and skills for torque and safety wiring inspection criteria.\n\nWire\nWrapping\n\nWIRE WRAPPING\nInstructors utilize lectures, demonstrations, and student application to develop\nrequired knowledge and skills for wire wrapping techniques, calibration, process\ncontrol requirements, and inspection criteria.\n\n8\nhours\n\nRequirements\n\nREQUIREMENTS FOR SOLDERED ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONIC ASSEMBLIES\n(IPC J-STD-001E/S)\nInstructors utilize lecture, demonstrations, and student application to train students\nin wires and terminals, through hole technology, surface mount technology and\ninspection. Base course and Space Addendum are offered.\n\n40\nhours\n\nFor more information:\nhttp://www.nasa.gov/centers/johnson/\ncapabilities/safety/index.html\n\n24\nhours\n\n4\nhours\n\n40\nhours\n\n2\nhours\n\n24\nhours\n\nCall for\ninfo\n\nLarry Sikes\nRITF Manager\n281-483-0366\nlarry.n.sikes@nasa.gov\nCheryl Corbin\nNASA RITF Lead\n281-244-8423\ncheryl.a.corbin@nasa.gov\n\n'
