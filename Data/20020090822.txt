That technology\nis now\nbeing employed\nin manufacture\n_l" an ec_l_gy display\nt_r the home, olTice or classroom:\na five-inch sealed\nsphere containing\nsix tiny shrimp, several tulSs of\nalgae and a clear "soup" of bacteria\nin filtered sea\nwater--a\nclosed ecosystem\nin which plant and animal\nlife are mutually\nsustaining.\nCalled the EcoSphere\xc2\xae,\nthe system is essentially\na care-free\naquarium\nthat requires\nno feeding, no\ncleaning. Shown in the accompanying\nphoto, it is,\nin effect, a model of Earth\'s own ecosystem\nwhen\nprovided\nwith an outside energy source: light, which is\nnecessary\nfor algae growth. The light may be indirect\nsunlight,\nbut for dimly lighted rooms the manufacturer\n_ffers an accessory:\na fluorescent-lighted\nlife support\nstand (not shown in the photo)\nthat serves as a base\nfor the sphere.\nThe algae bask in the light and produce\noxygen as\nthey grow. The shrimp--a\nspecial species found in\nPacific waters---breathe\nthe oxygen while nibbling on\nthe algae and the bacteria.\nThe shrimp and bacteria\ngive off the carbon\ndioxide needed\nby the algae for\nphotosynthesis\nand growth. The bacteria\ndecompose\nshrimp waste, breaking\nit down into basic chemical\nnutrients\nused by the algae. The algae and bacteria\ncan reproduce;\nshrimp reproduction\nhas not been\nverified. The algae can grow indefinitely;\nno one is\nsure how long the shrimp may live, but their life spans\ncould conceivably\nreach 10 years. In test spheres\nat\n,JPL, shrimp were still thriving after four years.\nThe EcoSphere\nis produced\nby Engineering\nand\nResearch\nAssociates,\nInc. (SEBRA), Tucson, Arizona\nas a sideline\nproduct;\nSEBRA is normally\nengaged in\nresearch,\ndevelopment\nand manufacture\nof medical\nand scientific\ninstruments\nand has a long association\nwith the U.S. space program.\nSEBRA president\nLoren\nAcker learned\nof the JPL technology\nwhen he saw one\nof the sealed flasks on a business\nvisit to a NASA\nofficial. Acker obtained\na license for the technolog\'y,\ndeveloped\na prototype\nmanufacturing\nprocess\nand\nproduced\nan initial rest marketing\nrun of 80 spheres\nin\n1_)83. The EcoSphere\'s\nsurprising\nacceptance\nled to\n1984 production\nof 200 units, sold through\nnational\ncatalog sales firms. Last October,\nSEBRA opened\na new cleanroom\nfacility in "lhcson for sustained\nproduction\nof EcoSpheres;\nthe facility is also\nconducting\nresearch\ntoward development\nof a broader\nline of classed ecosystems\nfor all educational\nlevels.\nq,_Ec,_Sphere\nAss_ciales,\n\nis\n111\xc2\xa2:.\n\na\n\nregistered\n\nlrademark\n\n_l\n\nEngineering\n\nand\n\nResearch\n\n'
