EDSN, scheduled for launch in late 2014, is designed to explore the use of small spacecraft networks to make synchronized, multipoint scientific measurements, and to organize and pass those data to the ground through their network. Networked swarms of these small spacecraft will open new horizons in astronomy, Earth observations and solar physics. Their range of applications include the formation of synthetic aperture radars for Earth sensing systems, large aperture observatories for next generation telescopes and the collection of spatially distributed measurements of time varying systems, probing the Earth's magnetosphere, Earth-Sun interactions and the Earth's geopotential. The EDSN communications network is maintained and operated by a simple set of predefined rules operating independently on all eight spacecraft without direction from ground based systems. One spacecraft serves as a central node, requesting and collecting data from the other seven spacecraft, organizing the data and passing it to a ground station at regular intervals. The central node is rotated among the spacecraft on a regular basis, providing robustness against the failure of a single spacecraft. This paper describes the communication architecture of the EDSN network and its operation with small spacecraft of limited electrical power, computing power and communication range. Furthermore, the problems of collecting and prioritizing data through a system that has data throughput bottlenecks are addressed. Finally, future network enhancements that can be built on top of the current EDSN hardware are discussed.
