EO-1 and SAC-C successfully joined in\nNovember 2000. Landsat-8 launched in February 2013.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Afternoon Constellation (A-Train) began with the Aqua launch in May 2002,\nfollowed by Aura in July 2004, PARASOL in December 2004, and the joint\nCALIPSO/CloudSat launch in April 2006 (\xe2\x80\x9cformation flying\xe2\x80\x9d)\n\xe2\x80\xa2 A-Train Mission Operations Working Group (MOWG) officially met for the\nfirst time in March 2003, preceded by an exploratory discussion between LaRC\n(John Stadler) and GSFC (Angie Kelly and Lauri Newman)\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Later A-Train missions followed:\n\xe2\x80\x93 OCO (2010) and Glory (2011) launches failed due to launch vehicle fairing problems\n\n\xe2\x80\x93 GCOM-W1 successfully launched in May 2012\n\xe2\x80\x93 OCO-2 successfully launched in July 2014\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Next missions: ?\n\n5\n\nMission Operations Working Group\nApril 13-15, 2016\n\nSignificant Meeting Topics\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nNASA HQ Perspective\nCurrent state of the missions\nLandsat-7 Exit Plans and Terra Exit Plan updates\nLong term plans for all missions\nCARA updates\nSpring 2016 IAM Series Plans and Current Status\nCCS Future Release Plans\nResults of Covariance Calculation Splinter Meeting\n\n6\n\nMission Operations Working Group\nApril 13-15, 2016\n\nState of the Constellations\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Morning Constellation\n\xe2\x80\x93 Terra and its 5 instruments are performing nominally, except ASTER SWIR.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Terra safehold in February.\n\n\xe2\x80\x93 Landsat 7 and Landsat 8 are performing nominally\n\xe2\x80\x93 EO-1 is currently ~23 km below Landsat 7/8 & Terra; continuing science observations\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Afternoon Constellation\n\xe2\x80\x93 A-Train IAM Series (Spring 2016) is ongoing\n\xe2\x80\x93 Aqua, Aura, and GCOM-W1 are performing nominally\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Aqua/AMSR-E ended it Science Mission on December 8, 2015\n\n\xe2\x80\x93 CloudSat is operating in Daylight-only Operation (Do-Op) mode; formation flying with\nCALIPSO\n\xe2\x80\x93 CALIPSO is performing nominally; making plans to switch lasers\n\nConstellations are operating successfully\nand producing valuable science data\nExcellent cooperation!

Note: This Action Item is being redefined based on the discussions at the\nJune 2015 MOWG meeting.\nAnalyze close approaches which have required mission team action on short notice. Determine why\nOPEN\nthe approaches were identified later in the process than most other events.
