Marshall Space Flight Center assigned vibration testing to a contractor, the Scientific Services and Systems Group of Wyle Laboratories, Norco, California. Wyle-3S, as the group is known, built a large facility at Huntsville, Alabama, and equipped it with an enormously forceful shock and vibration system to simulate the liftoff stresses the Saturn V would encounter. Saturn V is no longer in service, but Wyle-3S has found spinoff utility for its vibration facility. It is now being used to simulate earthquake effects on various kinds of equipment, principally equipment intended for use in nuclear power generation. Government regulations require that such equipment demonstrate its ability to survive earthquake conditions. In upper left photo, Wyle3S is preparing to conduct an earthquake test on a 25ton diesel generator built by Atlas Polar Company, Ltd., Toronto, Canada, for emergency use in a Canadian nuclear power plant. Being readied for test in the lower left photo is a large circuit breaker to be used by Duke Power Company, Charlotte, North Carolina. Electro-hydraulic and electro-dynamic shakers in and around the pit simulate earthquake forces.", "title": "Earthquake Testing", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-23T23:03:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-09-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20070019737, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20070019737, "id": "c3fabde22883443784395aa73acd81d1", "publicationName": "Spinoff 1979", "publicationDate": "1979-02-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 20070019711, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "Spinoff 1979", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20070019737.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20070019737/downloads/20070019737.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20070019737/downloads/20070019737.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20070019737/downloads/20070019737.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
