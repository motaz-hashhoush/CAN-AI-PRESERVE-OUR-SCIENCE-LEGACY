NASA partners with external organizations to access capabilities under collaborative agreements; enters into agreements for partner access to NASA capabilities; expand overall landscape of space activity; and spurring innovation. The U.S. national policy on commercial space is to develop a robust and competitive U.S. commercial space sector and to energize competitive domestic industries to participate in global markets. Commercial space must be competitive, while the government has other priorities such as safety, jobs, etc. NASA partnerships consist of Reimbursable and Non-Reimbursable Space Act Agreements. Partnerships at Ames aligns with Ames' core competencies, and Partners often office in the NASA Research Park, which is an established regional innovation cluster that facilitates commercialization and services as a technology accelerator via onsite collaborations between NASA and its partners.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "Lithuania", "submissionId": 20170005653, "endDate": "2017-10-13T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "Norwegian Space Center", "location": "Andenes, Norway"}}, "meetingId": "318eff9f9f3a42cca3e86281b2a241c8", "id": "a31687fd284b4d86b2909370365839ac"}, {"meta": {"organization": {"name": "Agency for Science, Innovation and Technology (MITA)", "location": "Vilnius, Lithuania"}}, "meetingId": "318eff9f9f3a42cca3e86281b2a241c8", "id": "06720cf0a19a41eabcf298700b8d5fcb"}], "name": "Vilnius Innovation Forum: Innovation Drift", "location": "Vilnius", "id": "318eff9f9f3a42cca3e86281b2a241c8", "startDate": "2017-10-12T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}, {"country": "Norway", "submissionId": 20170005653, "endDate": "2017-06-21T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "Norwegian Space Center", "location": "Andenes, Norway"}}, "meetingId": "4e5eb19adccf4c3f869d49ed8d20830b", "id": "f134c860d3294e359bd496c90d55f729"}, {"meta": {"organization": {"name": "Agency for Science, Innovation and Technology (MITA)", "location": "Vilnius, Lithuania"}}, "meetingId": "4e5eb19adccf4c3f869d49ed8d20830b", "id": "f7388399a5b14de3a65db17599fa517b"}], "name": "Spaceport Norway Conference and Expo 2017", "location": "Stavanger", "id": "4e5eb19adccf4c3f869d49ed8d20830b", "startDate": "2017-06-18T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20170005653, "id": "eff6cc8a6e7a4dde812855568c16d0df", "publicationDate": "2017-06-18T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20170005653.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20170005653/downloads/20170005653.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20170005653/downloads/20170005653.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20170005653/downloads/20170005653.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
