CreeD Deformation. H t Corrosion 8, Quench Crackh COSUl\no\nInvestigation of the diffusion and creep deformation mechanisms m a newly developed\nsuperalloy i d e n t i several dktinct deformation mechanisms, which are m y dependent upon\nmicrostructure, temperature, and stress. A creep deformation map illustrating the observed\ndeformation mechanisms as a function of s r s and temperature was developed. Microtwinning\ntes\nwas found to be the dominant deformation mechanism in the samples crept at 1250\xc2\xb0F (677\xc2\xb0C) at\na stress level of 1OOksi (690MPa). The deformation mechanisms observed in the samples crept in\nthe 1300\xc2\xb0F (704\xc2\xb0C) temperature regime at varying levels of stress showed mixed deformation\nmodes operative. A combination of isolated faulting of the f precipitates and continuous faulting\nof both the f precipitates and matrix were observed along with matrix dislocation activity. At the\nhigher temperature regime 1400\xc2\xb0F (7s0\xc2\xb0C), stacking fault ribbons and an increased amount of\nmatrix dislocation activity, which correlates with the thermally activated climbhypass deformation\nmode were observed. The dissolution of the tertiary f precipitates were observed, which may\nhave dictated the change in deformation mechanism from isolated precipitate shearing events to\nclimbbypass.\n\n1\n\nThe hot corrosion morphology revealed by laboratory tests were in good agreement with\nthe service experience of aircraft engine disks, which is characterized by localized corrosion, in\nthe form of pits. Tests at 1200\xc2\xb0F revealed no hot corrosion because the salt was solid at the test\ntemperature lower than its eutectic point of 1216OF, while the tests at 1400OF resulted in severe\nhot corrosion.\nQuantitative analyses of quench cracking during heat treatment of both eiastii and plastic\ntensile behavior in the range of 1850\xc2\xb0F to 2O5O0F,including measures of strain rate sensitivity\nand strain hardening, have yielded constitutive relations which provide good agreement between\nmodeling effwts and experimental observations.\nMalfunction and Ooerator E\n\nm [OSU)\n\nA number of different research activities were conducted, including a review of PSM\nincidents, PSM accidents, and a comparative review of existing propulsion system interfaces.\nThese different activities complemented each other and provided converging lines of evidence\nconcerning cognitive systems issues related to the handling of propulsion system malfunctions.\nSeveral cognitive activities were identified that need to be carried out by the flight crew, and\npotentially supported by the automation, both prior to and during a PSM event. These include:\nmonitoring, detection, diagnosis, and action setection.\n2.0 Active Controls for Emissions and Noise Reduction\n\nlntelliaent Combustor - WSR.Shock Tube 8 TAPS WDl\nA We# Stirred Reactor was designed, fabricated, and assembled with the following\nSpecifications:\n- Operating pressure = 1-20atm.\n- Air flow rates: 2.0 bm/sec\n- Fuel flow rate: 0 2 Ibm/sec\n- Residence Time = 2-8 ms\n- quivalence ratio = 0.3-2.5\n- Fuels: Jet A, JP-8, heptane and decane.\nA 5O-bars shock tube with the following specifications was designed, fabricated,\nassembled, and tested:\n- Operatingpressure = 50 atm.\n- Temperature: 500-3oooc\n- Residence Time =0.1 to 8 ms\nFuels: Jet A, JP-8, heptane and decane.\n\n-\n\nA 20-atm. TAPS (twin-annular, pre-swirl) combustor test facility was designed and adapted\nto the AFRL high pressure combustor research facility in Dayton, OH.\nlntelliaent Combustor - Active Combustion ControVMEMS CCWRU)\nA MEMS microvalve for fuel modulation was designed and fabricated which exhibited an\nactuation scheme combining such attributes as large displacement, moderate force and high\nfrequency operation. The microvalve is comprised of four individual silicon wafers that are bonded\ntogether. Fabrication was accomplished using a combination of resources: the MicroFabrication\nLaboratory (MFL) at CWRU and the MEMS Exchange.\n\n2\n\nA micromachined flow sensor integrable with the microvalve was developed to enhance\nvalve performance and enable closed-loop control. A high-temperature double-sampling amplifier\n(HTDSA) test chip was designed and laid out. It was fabricated through MOSIS using the AMI\n1.5-um bulk CMOS process. The test chip includes a complete high-temperature sensor\ninterface circuit, consisting of a correlated double sampling amplifier with delta modulator, a\ntemperature-stabilized oscillator, a Wheatstone bridge stimulus generator, and a f ully-differential\noperational amplifier (FDOA) test circuit.\nSic thin films were developed to improve the reliability of the flow sensor and the valve in\nthe harsh gas turbine environment. Test data collected include Young\'s Modulus, film stress,\nstress gradient, fatigue strength and abrasion resistance.\nlntellint Combustor Control - TAPS/LBO/Lean FlammabilitvLimits RJCl\nTests o the TAPS fuel nozzle in the atmospheric rig were conducted to study fuel injector\nf\ndynamics, LBO, and emissions at atmospheric pressure. A new TAPS nozzle adaptable to\natmospheric combustion was designed, fabricated and tested. Pressure pulsations and heat\nrelease characteristics were mapped in a wide range of equivalence ratii and air flow rate. Testing\nwas performedfor different pilotlcyclone splits to determine effects on LBO limit. Particular\nattention was devoted to the behavior near the lean flammability limit. It was found that there is a\nrise in both dynamic combustion pressure and CO concentrations before LBO. New emissions\ndiagnostics equipment was purchased, installed and initial tests were performed.\nActive combustion control tests were conducted in the atmospheric rig. Several high\nfrequency valves were characterized m a wide range of frequencies of >lOOOHz. Combustion\ndynamics were characterizedat different equivalence ratii and near Lean Blow Out (LBO).\nPressure and light emission signatures were analyzed and effectivenessof control by fuel split\nmodificationsand by modulations o fuel m the pirot and main circuits between pi& and main was\nf\ndetermined. Studies were conducted on damping effects of fuel tubes on pulsations in fuel flow\nrate.\nA pressure vessel for a high pressure rig was designed and fabricated, and the design of\nair, fuel supply and control, air heating, air cooling and water cooling systems, and ignition system\nwere finished.\nU)\nIntellbent Combustor - SDrav Characterization C C\nA fundamental study was conducted on atomization properties of liquid j t to improve\nes\ncurrent understanding of governing atomization physics.. In additin, data on the mode and\npositions of liquid breakup, spray coverage area and spray properties over a wide range of test\nconditions (momentum ratios, Weber numbers and Reyndds numbers) were obtained to assist in\nes\nthe design of fueUair premixers. Experiments were conducted on liquid j t injected normally into\na uniform subsonic crossflow and on spcey properties at the exit ptane of twin-annular pre-swirl\n(TAPS) premixers.\nA correlation of the jet penetrations was developed for jet breakup at a constant\nstreamwise location using Dgitizelt! and a nonlinear regression routine NLREG.\nThree primary sets of experiments were completed to characterize the fuel dispersion\ncharacteristics of the TAPS premixers. First, the mode and location of the liquid jet breakup within\nthe premixer were recorded at various operating conditions employing a borescope imaging\nsystem. Second, the resulting spray exiting the premixeer was studied via a planar Mie-scattering\nprobe. High resolution photographs and videos were recorded to determine dispersion\nwcharacteristics and to identify under which conditions wall impingement occur. Lastly, a t o\n\n3\n\ndimensional PDPA system was employed to quantify the atomization produced by the\ncircumferential jets around the exterior of the nozzle body.\nActive Noise Reduction - Plasma lniection COSU)\nResearch was conducted in two areas: (1) to develop high amplitude and bandwidth\nactuators capable of forcing high-speed and high Reynolds number jets for noise mitigation and\n(2)to utilize the developed actuators for noise mitigation in high subsonic and supersonic jets.\nOne of the key components of the system, a high voltage (- kHz) and current (- amp) plasma\npower supply and control system that can power a multitude of actuators simultaneously with\nprescribed phase pattem among the actuators and with a frequency up to 200 kHz, could be\nacquired mmmercblfy. The design and fabrication of such an eight-channel power supply and\ncontrol system was conducted.\nPreliminary results were obtained using this power supply and control system driving the\nplasma actuators. This DC plasma actuator power supply and control system is composed of two\nhigh voltage and three low voltage DC power supplies, eight high voltage transistor switches, and\na PC based function generator. The fabrication of this highly flexible, repetitively puked, multichannel high voltage plasma power supply and control system was very recently completed. The\nsystem is able to produce high voltage and current pulses between up to 8 pairs of pin electrodes\nlocated in a high-speed flow (localized arc plasma actuators). The repetition rate, the duty cycle,\nand the phase of the pukes can be independently contrdled for every channel. CapabiiKi of the\nf\nsystem included demonstration of phase-locked images o a Mach 1.3 ideally expanded\nt\nt\naxisymmettic jet a five different phases. The jet is forced with 8 actuators and operating a 10\nkHz and all 8 in phase. The effect of forcing organizes the structures of the jet and makes them\nvery robust and semi-periodic - similar to those of a very low speed and Reynolds number jet.\nActive Noise Reduction - Fluidic Iniection, Shape Memorv Allow & Acoustic Liners CUCl\nSubscale experimental testing of fluidic injection as a means of attenuating jet noise by\ninjecting small jets of air into the fan and core stream flows was performed on a s a model of a\ncb\ntypical regional jet engine. New hardware was designed to integrate fluidic injection capabilities\nfor both the con3 and fan sr a within the existing hardware. This new hardware included\nte m\nnozzles and hardware to pipe air internally to the nozzle exit planes. Results showed that:\na) the fan fluidic injection was more effective than core injection. The noise attenuation\non the core stream due to core injection was diminished once the fan stream ~eached\napproximately 400fhec. S i typical fan flow velocities are in the area of loo0 Wsec, not much\nacoustic benefit was gained with core injection.\nb) fan injection proved to be much more effective at reducing the peak noise levels. As\nthe injectiion pressure was increased, the peak noise levels continued to drop, but tube noise\ncontinued to rise as a consequence. There appeared to be a linear relationship between the\npeak noise reduction and injection pressure.\nc) fluidic injection was more successful at reducing jet noise at higher engine power\nsettings. In almost every configuration, the fluidic injection did little to reduce jet noise at low\nengine power settings and even raised EPNL levels in some cases.\n\nFull scale testing was conducted on an existing closed-circuit wind tunnel modifii to\nopen the circuit after the contraction. The test section was replaced with a constant area duct of\n24x24 inch cross section. The outflow of this constant area duct is then a free jet of nearly room\n..\ntemperature air at uniform velocities up to Mach 0 2 This jet was used to simulate the free\nstream over an engine nacelle at take-off velocity. A second duct was manufacturedto simulate\n\n4\n\nthe fan flow and was fitted to the bottom of the 24x24 inch duct. It was fed by a high pressure air\nsystem and generated a free jet of nearly constant velocity up to Mach 0.6. This second duct is\nfive inches high, representing the full-scale height of a typical separate flow fan nozzle outlet.\nThe flow emergent from this duct was used to simulate the fan flow of a separate flow engine at\ntake-off power. The results of the full-scale tests were encouraging and demonstrated an effect of\nfluidic injection on the flow field. Experimental issues were identified which would be helpful in\nguiding further research in this area.\nExperiments were conducted on the potential use of Shape Memory Alloys (SMA) for jet\nh\nnoise reduction applications in the exhaust nozzle.. SMA is a material that can deform when t e\ntemperature rises above a specific value, and then resume the original shape when the\ntemperature drops below that value. A significant disadvantage of many passive reduction\no\ntechniques is the increased drag penalty. The potentialt use SMA in such a way that passive\nnoise reduction techniques, such as chevrons or tabs, are "turned on" when requiredfor jet noise\nreduction, and "turned off when no longer required was evahrated. The tests did not use actual\nSMA material in the nozzle configurations, but rather simulated the deformed, or noise reducing\nconfiguration by connecting the chevron edges with a wire and gluing it in place. Far-field\nacoustic measurements were obtained in order to assess the expected noise penalty of the wire\ncompared to the benefit of the chevrons. Initial results were quite promising. The wire\nsignificantly reduced jet noise below that of the chevron nouie at all angles and frequencies.\nBased on these promising initial results, a relatively comprehensive optimization process was\ncompleted. Three different diameters of wire were tested at four different locations. It is\ninteresting to note that the reductions for this technique are similar to those for fluidic injection.\nThe configuration was not successful when used in coaxial flow. It is suspected that the portion of\nthe wire that interacted with the fan stream was the source of the additional noise. However,\nscavenging air from the compressor or other storage means is not required.\n\nWork was conducted on the design and fabrication of a flow duct liner test facility. The\npurpose of the flow duct facitity was to test paneis of acoustic liners under the conditions of high\nspeed grazing flow and high intensity sound that are typically experienced in the nacek of\naircraft engines. Capabilities include test panel sizes of 5 inches wide by 24 inches long, 6\nHartman generators covering the range of 1OOO Hz to 4OOO Hz, and electro-magnetic\ncompression drivers for acoustic excitation.\nAcoustic impedance experiments on new liner concepts were conducted in an existing\nwave tube apparatus that was developed under a previous research project sponsored by NASA.\nThe wave tube is of 1.5 inch by 1.5 inch square cross section. A total of 16 acoustic transducers\nwere employed to measure the aGoustjc field in the tube. The apparatus was d e s i i to perform\nw\nthe following t o types of acoustic measurements 1) Normalized Acoustic Impedance of a single\nlayer acoustic liner consisting of a cavity and a porous face sheet. In this measurement the phne\nwaves impact the test sample at right angles to the porous face sheet and 2) Acoustic Attenuation\nor Suppression (AdB) by a 4.5 inch long liner panel. Acoustic Impedance Tests were conducted\nf\non samples of single layer liners with the following types o face sheets:\no\no\no\n\nMetallic perforated sheets\n\nSmart Memory Alloy simulartion\nPerforatedflexible membranes\n\nThe SMA simulation with rigid perforated sheets showed that the variation o acoustic resistance\nf\nwith the porosity was the same as that for the base line perforated sheets with circular holes. For\na given porosrty, the flexible membranes produced very small resistance compared to the\nbaseline metallic perforated face sheets.\n\n5\n\n.\n\nI\n\n3 0 Active Structural Controls\n.\nTurbine Coolinq Control - Unstable Profile Prediction, Enhanced HT. Tech Demo (UCZ\n\nA LINUX cluster and 3D unsteady computer simulations of a gas turbine high pressure\nnozzle and rotor were performed with purge cavities to assess the impact of unsteadiness on\nturbine temperature profiles. The nozzle and rotor were gridded with the mdtiblock grid\ngeneration system and source t e r n applied to represent the fihn cooling. There were 56 blocks\nwith 1.5 million c b m the node gtid, and 97 blocks with 1.8 million celk in the rotor grid. lnW\ne\nsteady runs were accomplished using a computational program with 18 processors in the LtNUX\ncluster for the nozzle and rotor. The Mach number and Total Temperature in the nozzle were\ndetermined. The Mach contours showed the shock emanating of the trailing edge and the Total\nf\nTemperature contours clearly showed the cooling flow. A relative Mach number was determined\nto show where the strong rotor shocks are evident at midspan. The Relative Total Temperature in\nh\nthe rotor was calculated, and streamlines were spawned in the purge cavlty showing t e complex\nflmfield that exists there.\nSimulations, both in 2- and 3-D, were made on the effects of a pulsed cooling flow on a\nsteady cross flow. The simulations were conducted with three goals in mind; first to investigate\nthe fluid mechanics of a pulsed cooling flow, secondly to adapttvety "cancel out" the cross flow\nunsteadiness that would be caused by rotor-wake interactions, and lastly, as a result of the\nadaptive cooling, to determine i a reduction in the amount of cooling flow use was possible. The\ni\n2- and 3-D grids were generated using the commercially available grid generation software\npackage, Gambit, fmn Fttmtk With Gambit, a structured 2-D mesh was created with a cooling\nc h a n d OrieRted at 300 to #le main channel. The commerciatly available solver CFD++. by\n,k., epnpleyed to run the simulations in a two-stq process. For\nthe simulation was ntn for 2 0 iteFations with CFL\nthe\n1to 250mrthefirst 500 iterations. The lessons learnedfrom the 2numbers -from\nDimensional case were then ag@ed a0 a 3 0\n- gnd. The same injectbn angle,from the 2-D case,\nwas used with the 3-D simulation. The geometry of the cooling hole, however, was a slot. The\ngrid was again stnrctured and m i s t e d of 1,533,667 grid points and 1,479,200 elements. The\nmajor difference betweenthe 2- and 3fl grids is the change m the injectii angle from 3Oto 45\ndegrees. This was done to simplify the modeling process.\n\n-A\n.\nmodel was createdofthe unsteady flow passing over a turbine blade\ncaused by the wake d h\n-row,*\nwiths&?adycadingffawthatiliugtrrrtes\nthe effeets danmsbadycmssf4wona steady cooling Row. A mulhtep irpproach was&ibntR\nmodel the uwlumdy FoQorwakefbw.The fkststep was to modeithe tu\nblade as rtltat phde\nexperiencing cmssfbw with one cooling hole and several d f e e t injection angles; first in two\nifrn\ndimensions and stead\'y flow t establish the basic flow fieid and establish a belirJe for\no\nComparison. once the baseline was established the next step was to vary the CrOSsROw for the\nflat plate with varied injecth angles and see the effect on the steady flow of one coo(iRs jet.\nSeveral different methods were used for varying the CTOSSaOW, including t m varied mass fbw\nie\nand external sinusoidal pulsing. G i s were generated with Gambit for a two-dimensional flat\nrd\nplate with cooky hoie injection angles of 15". W , 45", W, and 900 to be used on this work\nelement and the work element with a steady crossflow and puked cooling jet. Starting with the\n15" and 30" cases baseline steady analysis was done using C F W as the flow solver. For the\nbaseline cases the crossflow was modeled as a steady reservoir temperature and pressure at the\ninflow and a set back pressure at the outflow. With the baseline flow established the next step\nwas trying out various inflow conditions within the CFD++ sdver to model the unsteady crossflow.\nThe first method used a time varied mass flow condition where a time step and maximum mass\nflow were set. Then the amount of variance for the mass flow was set and the mass flow was\n\n6\n\nramped up and down in accordance with the given time step. With the changing mass flow and\nfixed back-pressureflow transient reversal occurred.\nWork was conducted on three-dimensional simulations of an unloaded cooled vane under\nvarious operating conditions. Such conditions include a range of blowing ratios (0.4-2.0) as well\nas cross flow turbulence intensity levels (1, 10 and 20%). These simulations were compared and\nevaluated to better understand cooling jet physics and their effects on the cooling properties of\nthis particular vane design. These cases were run at Mach number 0 2 and Reynolds number\n.3\nbased on hydraulic diameter of 1.4~10\' with a main flow total temperature of 705.6K" and a\ncooling flow total temperature of 360K".Contours of film cooling effectiveness, total temperature\nand total pressure along with detailed streamline maps showing the propagation of cooling flows\nthrough the passage were used to eompare each case. The vane desiin chosen incorporates a\ncircular leading edge with two staggered rows of nine cooling holes, followed by a flat side which\nhas one row of thirteen holes located 0.5 inch downstream of the leading edge. A fine grid was\ngenerated that incorporated the entire design geometry. Three rows of cooling hdes were\nsimulated for a total of 3 cooling holes. The flow through each hole and the feed plenum were\n1\nsimulated. This grid consists of 14 million cells and has y+ values of 20 in the holes and 0.5-2.0\nalong the channel walk. The next step taken was to elevate the cross flow turbulence levels to\nvalues that are more in line with that producedin an operating gas turbine. Two turbulence levels\nof 10% and 20% were chosen. One simulation with increased cross flow turbulence intensity was\ncompleted. Simulations for the full geometry of an unloaded cooled vane used in an experimental\nrig test section have been conducted for several blowing ratios at free stream turbulence\nintensities of 1 , l O and 20%.\nTo explore active turbine blade film cooling control through pulsed injection, a\nCombustion Wind Tunnel FaciiiEy (CWTF) and a generic vane blade were utilized. The CWTF is\ncapable o temperatures nearing 1400 O , Mach numbers of approximately 0.30, and velocities in\nf\nF\nexcess of 600 Ws. The vane blade allows for both showerhead film cooling and sidewall fikn\ncooling. The blade was designed to allow separate control to each set of film coding hdes. The\nair entered through the base of the blade into two separate chambers and exited through the\nvarious film cooling holes. The blade was instrumented with static pressure taps to measure the\nblade surface static pressure. The blade surface temperature results were determined for the\nvarious freestream conditions and varying individuallyfor both the showerhead and sidewall\nblowing ratios. It was evident that the most effective cooling takes place when both the\nshowerhead and sidewall cooling are used simultaneously. At all blowing ratios for theses cases,\nthe blade surface temperature was kept the lowest. When only sidewall film cooling is used, the\nfront surface of the blade was the hottest temperature, which would be expected. For\nshowerhead film cooling, these h o b are angled towards the floor of the facility and it i evident\ns\nh\nthat they do cool the lower half of the blade and not t e upper half as would be expected.\nTurbine Coolina Control - Combustor Simulator (OSU)\nTwo combustor simulators of different sizes were designed and constructed to obtain\ndetailed three-dimensional heat transfer information in a controlled laboratory environment as\nclose to actual gas turbine engine operation as possible. These simulators are capable of\nproducing an arbitrary number of hot streaks of sufficiently significant temperature profile to be\nrepresentativeof the engine. The devices were designed and constructed to avoid non-uniform\nblockage within the flow path and to be sufficiently rigid that foreign material does not become\ndislodged and passed through the turbine stage. In a d d i t i i to the design, construction and\ndemonstration of the heater technology, all of the hardware necessary to locate the combustor\nsimulators in a gas turbine rig has been designed.\n\n7\n\nResearch was conducted on the feasibility of a high-strength and lightweight structural\nmaterial that can be utilized in a shape-changingairfoil design. The strength and stability\ncharacteristics that a novel Aluminum alloy would have to attain in order to meet the demands\noutlined for potential low-temperature stage fan blades were defined at the outset of the project:\na) achieve a room-temperature strength of 620MPa while maintaining sufficient stability to exceed\n450MPa at 15OoC,b) exceed 10% ductility over the range of ikservice temperatures, and c)\ndemonstrate an exceptional resistance to aging in order to maximize component life.\nThe main thrust of the development of this new alloy was grounded in the principle of\nrapid solidification. Several alternate approaches to alloying and processing were evaluated. In\norder to gain a more thorough understanding of the role of Mn additions in pinning the extremely\nfine grain size that naturally occurs in the rapidly quenched flakes, three binary alloys were cast\nat levels that exceed what would be feasible to cast using conventional methods (1.Owt%.\n1.5wt%, and 2.0wt%) due to the extensive eutectic formation that would occur during\nsolidification. As expected, the flakes contained very little if any eutectic constituent volume\nfraction based on direct SEM observation.\nFlake was consolidated in copper tubes and then rolled after stripping the copper away.\nTEM observation of the AI-Mn binary alloys was carried out on samples that had been subpcted\nto extended times at elevated temperatures (between 350 and 500\xc2\xb0C) in order to gain a better\nunderstanding of the degree to which the refined grain structure of the consolidatedflake could\nbe maintained at temperatures well beyond the expected maximum operationaltemperature\nf\nexposure of 150\xc2\xb0C. The distribution of &Mn and the performanceo the particle dispersion in\nlocking down the grain structure was demonstratedto varying degrees of success even at\nextreme temperatures (4oOoCfor 81 burs), with the 2wt% Mn binary alby demonstrating the\nmost positive contribution to Stability. A modeling approach to estimate and compare alloy\nresidual alloy strength as a fondion of temperature was developed using mechanism retxwety\nalgorithms of a) Recovery/Coursening,b) Dislocation Release/Flow and c) Dislocation\nRefinement. The resutting model correctly predicted pure metal creep and is being adapted to\nengineering materials.\nSmart Containment Svstem (UA)\nThe general objective of this research was to investigate possible scenarios of crack\npropagation in a composite softwall containment system due to forces produced by the\nunbalancedfan after the blade out event in the engine. ihe particular objedke of this study\nwas to apply a force-moment system to the front flange of the containment in a dynamic and\nstatic way in order to propagatethe crack from the initial hole.\nIn the first step of the investigation, the blade-out was simuhted to produce a realistic\nhole in the contak#nent.Resutls ofthe simulation were also usedtoassessthebading\nproduced by the interaction of the unbalanced fan with the undamaged section of the\ncontainment system. It was found that the containment can be subjectedto twisting, shearing\nand bending forces and moments.\nThe post impact loading conditions were studied parametrically using LsDyna3D for\na dynamic case and ABAQUS implicit code for a static load application. In each case, the\nenergy stored in the inner housing and stresses in elements of highest stress concentration\nwere measured. LsDyna3D simulations demonstrated crack initiation and propagationfor the\napplied moments. It was observed that the crack path depended on the type of elements\nused and the density of the mesh used in the simulation.\n\n8\n\nc\n\nPublicatiins\n1.
