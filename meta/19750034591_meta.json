Measurements were made with the NASA 64-m parabolic antenna operating at a wavelength of 13.1 cm. Data were plotted as a function of the longitude of the central meridian. Both data sets showed similar periodic intensity variation with longitude. However, the 1974 data points were consistently above the corresponding 1973 values. The flux density difference was attributed to the increase in the planet's decimetric radio emission. Measured at wavelengths of 21 cm and 11 to 13 cm the average peak flux densities were plotted as a function of the epoch of each observation.", "title": "Recent increase in Jupiter's decimetric radio emission", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-08T03:03:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19750034591, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Klein, M.
