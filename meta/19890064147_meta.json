A one-dimensional radiative-convective model derived from that of Kasting et al. (1984) and Kasting and Ackerman (1986) was then used to determine if a 1.3-bar CO2 partial pressure on Mars (which is equivalent to about 9 bars on earth) is consistent with the climatic conditions thought to have existed on earth four billion years ago. Results indicate that a dense CO2 atmosphere on early Mars at perihelion is consistent with conditions expected to have existed four billion years ago on earth. Earth would then have had a stable atmosphere with temperatures warm enough to support liquid water on the surface.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19890064147, "issn": "0273-1177", "id": "a5fdf01e84624bfdb4ebb3313814c64c", "publicationName": "Planetary Biology and Origins of Life, 20th, 21st, and 23rd, Espoo, Finland, July 18-29, 1988) Advances in Space Research", "publicationDate": "1989-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
