The purpose of the study is to investigate and report all the ramifications of introducing advanced sealing technology into gas turbine engine secondary flow systems. In addition to detailed cost/benefit results we will also derive seal operational requirements which can be fed into a subsequent advanced seal development program. Using the current Allison AE3007 engine as a model/baseline we have examined 6 different advanced seal variations. We have settled on a design with 2 advanced seals which results n a savings of 2% in chargeable cooling. The introduction of these advanced seals has resulted in substantial changes to surrounding engine components which will be reported.", "title": "Advanced Seals and Secondary Airflow Systems for Allison AST", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-24T08:13:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20080003812, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Munson, John"}, "organization": {"name": "Allison Engine Co.", "location": "Indianapolis, IN, United States"}}, "id": "0d05308e77bc47728fe658cdfc561281"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-04-09T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20080003812, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20080003812, "id": "1ec4670752bb422cb15caf36df28abb0", "publicationName": "Seals/Secondary Fluid Flows Workshop 1997; Volume I", "publicationDate": "2006-08-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 20080003791, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "Seals/Secondary Fluid Flows Workshop 1997; Volume I", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PROCEEDINGS", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20080003812.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20080003812/downloads/20080003812.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20080003812/downloads/20080003812.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20080003812/downloads/20080003812.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
