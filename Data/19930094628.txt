A simple calculation then affords a linear slot\nin extrapolation.\nTo render the problem amenable to uniplanar treatment, it was necessary to provide such flow\nconditions, for which the velocity distribution was the\nsame in all horizontal sections (as far as the upper and\nlower limit range.).\n-Compliance with this premise was de ....\nmanded from the second and third cases also.\nFor the\nfirst case - that is, perfectly free jet expansion - the\ntwo-dimens ional i ty was summari-ly predet ermined, whereas in\nthe other two cases, it was more difficult.\nHowever, before going into details, it is advisable to describe the\nexperimental set-up it self.The air is supplied by a tTIo-stage blower.\nA honeycomb is mounted at\nG,\nwhile aft of it the circular section merges into a rectangUlar pressure chamber which\ngradually tapers to a slot\nS.\nThis part of the eqUipment\nserved in all experiments, although in the second and\nthird cases some 6ther pa~ts were added.\nA lateral orifice\non the pressure chamber D connects with a manometer,\nwhich is held constant by continuous regulation of the\nr.p.m. of the motor, thus insuring a constant air volume\nin the pressure chamber as well as through the slot.\nThe\nactua l test section - after passage of slot - was, in the\nfirst case, the free air space before the slot.\nThus, the\nfirst problem consisted in dividing this space into exact\ncoordinates, SO as to be able to measure it point by point.\nThis was accomplished with the support shown in figure 2.\nA s~all table mounted on two parallel posts can be raised\n\nI\nI\n\nIT .A.

Since, in turbulent flow, there is a continuous change ;\nin flow direction, of the individual fluid particles toI\'\nward the main flow direction, the manometer reading is\nlower than the true static pressure. And this figure is\nso r.m ch less as the turbulent interchange is greater hOT. ce the premise, confirmed by personal observational\nstudy, appears justified.\nThat is, a survey apparatus of\nth is kind indicat~s a minimum of the pressure at the points\nof maximum interchange and consequently, gives the point of\nmaximum shearing stress, but for the rest, is totally unsuitable for recording the actual static pressure in turbulent flow (reference 3).\nThe next step was to \' design a device which was not re-\n\nR.A.C.A. Technical Memorandum No. 789\n\n5\n\nsponsive to changes of flow direction.\nAfter various\nabortive att .empts, the form shown in figure 8 was adopted.\n""-\'rhe\'" static" p \'r essur\'e , tap was plac\'ed \'w it-hin\'--a " turned-up hollow cylinder, whose walls were hollow and served as pressure leads to the manometer.\nA calibration for directional change revealed it to be unaffected by flow direction\nover a range of approximately 80 0 ; that is, the reading\nwas the same after being turned through a \xc2\xb140 o angl~ relative to the \xc2\xb7main flow direction (fig. 9).\n,\n\n,\n\nOn the . other hand, it was still markedly influenced\nby the dynamic pressure (fig. 10) which, of course, decreases as the ai r speed increases.\nSince most measurements were made at such speeds, when \xc2\xb7the effect of dynamic\npressure is small, the order of magnitude of the static\npressure was obtainable to such a degree as to make the\nst a tic p ressure effect amenable to estimation when comput ing the shearing stresses.\nThe interaction of the static pressure on the shearing stress calculation could be disregarded in first approach (as proved elsewhere), hence it afforded a more- exact determination of the static pressure in our particular\ncase.\nIn any case, it appears to be desirable, however,\nto concentrate on t~e design of a survey apparatus whic~,\ntotally unaffected by main flow direction and amount of\ndynamic pressure, affords an unobjectionable static pressure reading.\nRESULTS OF TESTS\n\nOpen Jet\nThe thus-obtained velocity distributions for variou~\nslot spacings a\nar e sho wn in . figure 11.\nThese profiles\nare plotted nondimensionally in figure 12 after dividing\nthe pertinent velocities by th .e velocity maximum of the\nparticular profile and the related position coordinate by\nthe coordinate of the halved maximum velocity.\nThe velocity profiles may be expressed by\nu\n\nComparing two profiles each for the constants\n\np\n\nand\n\nN.A.C;A.\n\n6\n\nTechn~ccil\n\nMemorandum No. 789\n\nwe have:\n\nq,\n\np\n\n=\n\n0.50,\n\n- q - = 0.997\n\n- in accord with the theory which stipulates\n+ 1.\n\np\n\n1\n\n- 2\'\n\nq\n\n=\n\nFor comparison with Toll~ienTs theoretical velocity\ndistribution, w& included his theoretical curve in figure\n1 2 ..\nBoth the theoretical and experimental curves have\nbeen nornalized so as to be agreeable in the points y = 0,\nu\n\n=\n\nu max\n\nand\n\ny\n\n=\n\ny\n\n\'U )\n\n(_ max\n\n\\-2--\'\n\nu\n\n=\n\nU\n\n~ax\n\n-~.\n\nApp roaching maximum velocity, the measured velocity\nis seen to be higher, and at the jet boundary lower, than\nthe theoretical.\nThe same phenomenon was observed in the\nrotationally symmetrical wake (unpublished measurements by\n~ikuradse and Schlichting).\nThe proportionality constant\nc\nin the mixing distaace equatio~ 1 = c x was defined*\nat\nc = 0.0165,\nwhich gives 1 = O.O GG ,\nwhen 2b\ntotal\nb\n\n=\n\njet width.\nPartially Open Jet\nThe obtained velocity profiles for different slot distances a\nare s h own in figure 13.\nWhereas th e first three\nprof ile s (a = 10 , 20, and 35 cm (3.94, 7.87, and 13.78 in.\xc2\xbb\nstill show a slot-width effect and therefore do not count\nin the final evaluation, the others, farther away, do not\nreveal it.\nAt t h e same time it was imp ortant to know\nwhet~er these profiles were mutuallY similar and the flow\nthu s f ollowed a simple law n ithin th e entire range.\nThe\npr ocedure was the same as for the open jet.\nThe indi v idu ally recorded velocity was divided by its momentary maxiBurn of the profile, and the ~ndividual position coordinates\nb ~r the c .() 0 rdinate of the velocity w:lich, on the free side\nof tl\'lC profilc, equals half the velo city maximum.

The value for the , partially open jet is\n\n1=\nb\n\n0.0684\n\nHere b = width of mixing zone - that is, exclusive of friction zone on the fixed wall.\nThis figur~ is fairly agreeable with that for\n\nthe f ree jet boundary\n\n(t = 000682).\n\ngiven in Tollmien\'s cited report.\nFlow in Partially Expanding Jet\nExperimentally, this case is not unlike that of the\nothers except for the closing of the fourth side of the ,\nprevious thre e-sided channel.\nThe balance bar carrying\nthe pressure survey apparatus was inserted through openings\ninto the newly installed side wall of the channel.\nThe\nopenings for different slot spacings h~rmonized exactly\nwith the profile of the balance bar. The unused openings\nwere carefully plugged.\nThe measurements included the total head and the static pressure in eight sections, affording the velocity distribution in the channel for the diff ere nt slot spacings* (fig. 16).\nIndividual graphical integration of the velocity profiles then gave the volume of\nflow for each.\nThe points of equal flow volume were then\nconnected, resulting in the flow pattern shown in figure\n17.\nLastly, we computed the mixing distance for the case\nof abruptly expanding channel.\nThe velocity profiles being no longer similar, the calculation of the mixing distance had to be made on the basis of the general equation\n(9).\nThe shearing stress\nTo at the wall was computed\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n"\'The measured velocity profiles reveal "bulges" near the\npOints where the prefix of the velocity changes.\nThis is\ndue to the fact that at the point where the turbulent velocity fluctuation is of the same order of magnitude as\nthe mean velocity, the determination of the ~elocity from\npitot-tube readings is considerably falsified; that is~\nthe velocity is always too high.\nFor the subsequent evaluations, this error was minimized by plotting the velocity\nprofiles smooth in the vicinity of the zero points.\n(Compare the dashed lines in fig. 16.)\n\nN.A.C.A.

Even so, it may be\nseen that the mixing distance in the suddenly expanding\nchannel is of the same order of magnitude as for the open\nand the partially open jet.\n\n,-\n\n14\n\nN.A.C.A. \'\n\nT&ch~ical\n\nMemorandum No. 789\n,"\n\nIn conclusion, the writer wishes to acknowledge his\nindebtedness to Profes~or Prandtl for suggesting the investigation, and for , his ya\'iua-ble \' 13-ssistance; and to Dr.\nW.
