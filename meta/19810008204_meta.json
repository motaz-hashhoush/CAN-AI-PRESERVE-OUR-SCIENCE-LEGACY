The pulse, arterial pressure, skin temperature, respiratory rate, minute respiratory volume and electrical activity of the muscles involved were all measured. Performance of the exercises with maximum muscular exertion for 20 sec and without movement resulted in the greatest shifts in these indices; in the conventional manner substantial changes did not occur; and with isometric muscular exertion with 50% maximum force with and without movement, optimal functional shifts resulted. The latter is recommended for use in industrial exercises for the prevention of hypodynamia. Ten exercises are suggested.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19810008204, "id": "44841154b4bc4e2393a8c474831c45b9", "publicationDate": "1980-08-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19810008204.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19810008204/downloads/19810008204.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19810008204/downloads/19810008204.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19810008204/downloads/19810008204.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
