The toolbox employs both iterative and non-iterative methods to converge to an optimal solution by minimizing the cost function. The toolbox could be used in either of constrained and unconstrained optimizations. The control process involves 1 to 7 degrees-of-freedom perturbations per segment of primary mirror in addition to the 5 degrees of freedom of secondary mirror. The toolbox consists of a series of Matlab/Simulink functions and modules, developed based on a \"wrapper\" approach, that handles the interface and data flow between existing commercial optical modeling software packages such as Zemax and Code V. The limitations of the algorithm are dictated by the constraints of the moving parts in the mirrors.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 20110012217, "id": "32709b45dd7a455493749526b7902ad0", "publicationName": "NASA Tech Briefs, February 2011", "publicationDate": "2011-02-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 20110012198, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "NASA Tech Briefs, February 2011", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20110012217.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20110012217/downloads/20110012217.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20110012217/downloads/20110012217.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20110012217/downloads/20110012217.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
