b'INCREASED SCIENCE INSTRUMENTATION FUNDING STRENGTHENS MARS PROGRAM\nL. D. Graham1, T. G.

Recent\ntechnological advances provide the foundation for a\nsignificant evolution of instrumentation; however, the\nfunding support is currently too small to fully utilize\nthese advances. We propose that an increase in funding for instrumentation development occur in the nearterm so that these foundational technologies can be\napplied. These instruments would directly address the\nsignificant knowledge gaps for humans to Mars orbit,\nhumans to the Martian surface, and humans to Phobos/Deimos. They would also address the topics covered by the Decadal Survey [1] and the Mars scientific\ngoals, objectives, investigations and priorities as stated\nby the MEPAG [2].\nWhile multiple new instrumentation funding\npaths used to exist, several key planetary science funding paths have been consolidated to a single one, the\nPlanetary Instrument Definition and Development\nProgram. The most common funding paths used to\ninclude:\n1) Planetary Instrument Definition and Development Program (PIDDP)\n2) Astrobiology Science and Technology for Instrument Development (ASTID) Program\n3) Mission Concept Development for Astrobiology Small Payloads (replacing ASTID)\n4) Mars Instrument Development Project\n5) Planetary Major Equipment (PME) program\nHowever, The Mars Instrument Development Project\nand the Mission Concept Development for Astrobiology Small Payloads have been combined with the\nPIDDP (Fig. 1). The PIDDP actively supports the\nadvancement of spacecraft-based instrument technology that show promise for use in scientific investigations on future planetary missions. The program has a\nhistory of producing key instruments for planetary\nscience. Since 1980, approximately 50% of the science instruments flown beyond Earth orbit originated\nin the PIDDP including the ChemCam and CheMin\ninstruments [3]. Unfortunately, the FY12 PIDDP\nbudget has only $10.9 M, spread across 3 years and\nwith an expected 10-15 instrument selections [4].\nThere are three primary areas of technology development that have or could potentially have a significant positive impact on instrumentation development.\nThese areas are carbon nanotubes (CNT), microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), and nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS). These three technologies\n\nFigure 1: Planetary Science Instrumentation Development\nPrograms and TRL Level\n\nprovide real opportunities for reduced size, mass, and\npower needs for the instruments themselves and, as a\ndirect result, for the landing/orbiting vehicle and the\nsize of the launch vehicle as well.\nSome of these technologies have been successfully demonstrated in space, others such as NEMS,\nhave yet to have significant experience in this environment. Future micro- or nano-instruments can thus\nbe developed at the sub-millimeter level, or even\nsmaller, and can either miniaturize current laboratory\ninstrumentation or develop new instruments based on\nthe functionality of the new technology. Application\nand demonstration of functions such as NEMS usage\nas a switch can thus become a reality.\nThere are 3 major reasons why an increase in scientific instrumentation development to the TRL 6\nwould be desirable.\n1. Investigate specific scientific questions: Development of a variety of instrumentation allows for\nselection of a specific instrument or suite of complementary instruments to be flown to a selected landing\nsite. This science analysis capability thus provides a\n\xe2\x80\x9cmix and match\xe2\x80\x9d approach to targeting specific questions for a site. The converse is also true. Other instrument(s) could be developed to provide a broad\ngeneral investigation of the Mars environment, geology, compositional content, geophysical properties or\neven astrobiological questions.\nLanded missions provide an excellent opportunity\nfor discoveries such as detection of volatiles, identification of organic material, and detection of a biosignature. Appropriate science instrumentation on these\nmissions allow for the identification of the best available samples for return to Earth or for discoveries that\nwould interest and excite the general public.\n\n2. Technology Development: Increasing funding\nfor instrument development provides an excellent opportunity to develop a broad scope of new instruments,\nmanufacturing methods, and technologies. Applications of these to terrestrial uses have the potential for\nbenefit in many diverse areas and products.\nAn increase in development funding would also allow for broader participation from a more diverse\ngroup than currently exists. More organizations and/or\nteams of organizations would be interested in applying\nsince the probability of selection may be increased.\n3. Synergy with Human Exploration: Scientific\ninvestigations that directly address human exploration\nquestions concerning Mars, Phobos, and Deimos\nwould significantly reduce safety and mission success\nrisks. Improved knowledge of the environment, operational constraints and in-situ demonstration would\nprovide critical information to improve future crew\nsafety and current mission success.\nIn addition, public interest in activities directly\nleading to human exploration of Mars, Phobos, and\nDeimos would also be a key benefit.\nWe argue that an increase of science instrumentation funding would be of great benefit to the Mars\nprogram as well as the potential for human exploration\nof the Mars system. If the total non-Earth-related\nplanetary science instrumentation budget were increased 100% it would not add an appreciable amount\nto the overall NASA budget and would provide the\nreal potential for future breakthroughs. If such an approach were implemented in the near-term, NASA\nwould benefit greatly in terms of science knowledge of\nthe Mars, Phobos/Deimos system, exploration risk\nmitigation, technology development, and public interest.\nReferences: [1] Committee on the Planetary Science Decadal Survey N.
