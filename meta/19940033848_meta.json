These two techniques were found to be reliable and relatively convergent. Seniority and a peer-rated Performance and Competence factor proved to be most closely associated with flight assignments, while supervisor ratings and a peer-rated Group Living and Personality factor were found to be unrelated. Results have implications for the selection and training of astronauts.", "title": "Assessments of astronaut effectiveness", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-16T12:15:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19940033848, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Rose, Robert M."}, "organization": {"name": "John D. and Catherine T.
