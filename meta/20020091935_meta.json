This is a non-traditional type spinoff in that it does not simply reapply existing technology but development of new technology using Deere's extensive R & D capability to complement NASA's efforts, adapting NASA information to new research paths and providing feedback of importance to NASA's own work. NASA/Deere exchange extends to these areas: Composite materials, ceramics, wear and lubrication, plasma coatings and sensors, and electronics.", "title": "Partners in Technology", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-20T22:17:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-09-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20020091935, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20020091935, "id": "9298323eb159423491c6f094786e47f5", "publicationName": "Spinoff 1984", "publicationDate": "1984-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20020091935.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20020091935/downloads/20020091935.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20020091935/downloads/20020091935.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20020091935/downloads/20020091935.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
