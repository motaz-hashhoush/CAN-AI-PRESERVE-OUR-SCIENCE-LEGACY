b'Whole Module Offgas Test Rep\ne\ne\nT\nport:\nOrbital D-1 Module\nM\n\nFr\nrom March 20 to March 25 2013 a che\n5,\nemist from the JSC Toxico\ne\nology Group a\nacquired samp\nples\nof air in 500 ml evacua canisters from the seal Orbital D Module at Wallops Isla\n5\nated\nled\nD-1\nt\nand, VA. One\ne\nbackgroun sample wa acquired fro the facilit near the mo\nnd\nas\nom\nty\nodule at the st of the tes Samples of the\ntart\nst.\nf\nmodule ai were taken in triplicate once the modu had been sealed, and th taken aga in triplicat\nir\no\nule\nhen\nain\nte\n2.73 days later, and aga 4.73 days from the star Of the sam\nain\ns\nrt.\nmples collected at each time the first ser\nd\ne,\nrved\np\ns\nd,\nf\nmples were an\nnalyzed. The r\nresults of 7\nas a line purge and was not analyzed and two of the latter sam\nsamples (o backgrou and 3 pair are reporte in the appe\none\nund\nrs)\ned\nended tables. Table 1 lists the analytical\nl\nconcentra\nations. Table 2 gives the T values indexe against 7-d Spacecraf Maximum Allowable\ned\nday\nft\nConcentra\nations (SMAC and Table 2A gives T values indexe against 180\nCs)\ne\nv\ned\n0-day SMACs. For purpos of\nses\nthe offgas test only the 7 day SMAC are relevan The averag recoveries of surrogate standards pla\ns\ne\nCs\nnt.\nge\naced\nin the can\nnisters to valid analytica integrity we as follows 13C-acetone 101%; fluor\ndate\nal\nere\ns:\ne,\nrobenzene, 98\n8%;\nand chloro\nobenzene, 94%.\nAnalytical data contained in Table 2 show that the am\nA\na\nn\nw\nmbient facility air was extre\ny\nemely clean (\n(0.01\nT units). Analyses of pairs of sampl that were taken during t test show excellent agr\nA\np\nles\nt\nthe\nw\nreement betw\nween\nthe pa and a rate of increase o 0.025 T un\nairs\ne\nof\nnits\nper da (first interv t = 0 d to t = 2.73 d) an\nay\nval,\nnd\n0.018 units per day (second inte\ny\nerval, t = 2.73 d to\n3\n73\nght\nn\nis\nt = 4.7 d).

Thi T value is w below th threshold th would imp\n1\nis\nwell\nhe\nhat\npose\nconstraint on crew operations at the time of first entry. The p\nts\ne\nt\nprimary contri\nibutors to the T value durin\nng\nthe test were trimethyls\nsilanol, acetal\nldehyde , and hexamethylc\nd\ncyclotrisiloxa The crew can enter the\nane.\nw\ne\nmodule with no special protection against volatil pollutants; however, the usual protect\nw\na\nle\ntions against\nfloating particles shoul still be followed.\nld\n\n-------------------------------------John T.
