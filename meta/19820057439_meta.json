Ceiling altitude and endurance for hovering at typical power levels, including partial power failure, are predicted. Climb performance at various altitude and gross weight conditions have been examined. Forward flight performance of this vehicle is illustrated in terms of typical performance parameters such as maximum speed, maximum range, and endurance, over the full range of its payload capability. Optimum payload weights have been identified which result in maximum range at sea level density altitude and constant endurance at various altitudes, both during hover and cruise flights.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"submissionId": 19820057439, "endDate": "1982-08-27T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "International Council of the Aeronautical Sciences", "location": "Seattle, WA", "id": "516d0d6be4354a6288d281db0e33901c", "startDate": "1982-08-22T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 19820057439, "id": "a37fa1aaf1a1413fa889f8295c40438b", "publicationDate": "1982-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
