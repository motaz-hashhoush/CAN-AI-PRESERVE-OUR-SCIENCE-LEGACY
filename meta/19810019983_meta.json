Collector areas for each of four buildings cover 780 sq ft, with storage capacity of 390 cu ft per building. The air system has a special air handling unit to move air through the collectors and into and out of the rock storage, with connection to the air duct distribution system. The heat of the motor is added to the heat delivered to the system. The solar system also includes four motorized special low leakage dampers and two gravity fabric dampers. The system is automatically controlled by a solid state controller with three thermistors: one located in the collectors, one in the rock box to plenum, one in the return air duct from the heated space. A three stage heating thermostat, located in the conditioned space, controls the operation.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19810019983, "id": "bd28dbf05a084847ac5a76db707c4aa1", "publicationDate": "1981-06-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19810019983.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19810019983/downloads/19810019983.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19810019983/downloads/19810019983.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19810019983/downloads/19810019983.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
