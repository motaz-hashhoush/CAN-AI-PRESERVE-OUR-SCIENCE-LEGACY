Both long-fast and minimum energy transfer missions are evaluated, and their 30-day maximum, annual maximum, and total slab skin and blood-forming organ (BFO) doses are compared. When large flares were included while the astronauts were on the surface, the delivered dose did not significantly contribute to the total dose (less than 4 cSv BFO dose, or 8 percent of the guideline annual limit, for the most energetic event simulated) due to the substantial protection provided by the Martian atmosphere. However, dose delivered by large flares during transit is dependent on vehicle shielding and distance from the sun. All of the long-fast transfer missions studied had lower total and annual maximum doses than the corresponding minimum energy transfer missions (on average, 30 percent less for missions having no large flares and the shielding thicknesses evaluated in this study). For all the missions studied, having the astronauts spend one-third of their day during transit in a 10 g/sq cm storm shelter resulted in significantly lower total doses.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 19930029291, "endDate": "1992-08-12T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "AIAA"}}, "meetingId": "c94943d6bdce4580b38124002e509232", "id": "a65ad5ec729f40779ef8ade720189172"}, {"meta": {"organization": {"name": "AAS"}}, "meetingId": "c94943d6bdce4580b38124002e509232", "id": "c999800d3ca14da588e581a746e903a8"}], "name": "AIAA and AAS, Astrodynamics Conference", "location": "Hilton Head Island, SC", "id": "c94943d6bdce4580b38124002e509232", "startDate": "1992-08-10T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 19930029291, "id": "5ab6a45661e54a7fa82c8823baac01dc", "publicationDate": "1992-08-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
