b'Industrial Productivity\n\nSEAL THE DEAL\nAdding more reliability to electronic parts is always of\nforemost interest to high-tech manufacturers. A two-year\nstudy has mastered a process technology to render plastic\nencapsulated electronics modules more resistant to\nmoisture and environmental contaminants.\nAvanTeco, Whittier, California, and Revtek, Inc., of\nTorrance, California, now produce, market, and sell a\nnewly-devised coating method for electronic packaging.\nThis technology was brought to fruition through Small\nBusiness Innovation Research (SBIR) contracts from the\nJet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). This novel work was\ninitially performed by Engineering Technologies Associates of Laguna Hills, California.\nConsidered risky is the packaging of electronic parts\nin low-cost plastics. While fine for most commercial\ndevices, plastic packaging of critical electronic circuits\nwithin expensive spacecraft and medical equipment\nrequired further reliability studies. The approach taken by\nresearchers was to originate an overcoat for circuits with\nan inorganic moisture barrier. A low temperature vacuum\ndeposition process that was non-damaging to underlying\nepoxy and the assembled circuit proved a workable\nsolution. This overcoating reduced moisture absorption of\nencapsulated samples. Also, the dual coating had low\nweight loss in thermal vacuum and low toxicity level as\ntested to NASA specifications.\nOver 90 percent of all integrated circuits produced\ntoday are either transfer molded or liquid encapsulated in\nepoxy plastic. Multimillions of these plastic-packaged\nchips are produced each day for the consumer and\ncommercial electronics markets. They perform reliably for\nthe intended environments. However, with the emergence\nof large, very high density, high speed chips, new concerns\nabout the use of plastic encapsulation have been raised.\nMaking this issue more debatable is the drive to\nreduce costs of civilian and military hardware, an approach that calls for use of commercial off-the-shelf\nelectronics, or COTS for short. Therefore, enhancing\ncircuit reliability through use of protective coatings,\ninstead of hermetically-packed integrated circuits, has\nbecome increasingly suggested. But there are several\nproblems to this approach, one being the exposure of\nplastic-packaged parts to high humidity at extreme\ntemperatures. Plastics, no matter how good, are permeable\nto moisture over time, which can then penetrate to the\ninterior of the device and cause a catastrophic failure.\nJPL-supported research teams evaluated candidate\norganic and inorganic barrier coatings and chemically\ninert plastics. The winning combination? Applying an\n\nHigh-value electronic circuitry can be overcoated with an\ninorganic moisture barrier. Shown is a circuit board, replete with\nan alert chip (center) that signals if moisture has penetrated the\ncircuit surface.\n\ninorganic barrier coating over the plastic, a technique that\ngreatly reduces moisture penetration and improves\nreliability. A process was then developed for overcoating\nepoxy encapsulated circuits with a secondary inorganic\ndielectric film for added moisture protection. To increase\nlong-term moisture resistance, adhesion between coatings\nwas optimized.\nThe dual coating approach is expected to add\nmoisture protection to commercial epoxy-coated parts at\nlow added cost, and to reduce packaging cost for many\nhigh reliability circuits for space, military, and medical\nuse.\nSBIR contract work also yielded a low-cost and easily\ntested moisture and contamination sensor chip. It acts as a\n\xe2\x80\x9cmoisture fuse,\xe2\x80\x9d says Dr. James Licari, President of\nAvanTeco. \xe2\x80\x9cOnce moisture has completely penetrated to\nthe active surfaces of a plastic encapsulated module, the\ndevice will short out,\xe2\x80\x9d he says. \xe2\x80\x9cHowever, using this\nfailure mechanism in a beneficial way detects the penetration of moisture and ionic contaminants through the\nplastic or into a hermetically sealed enclosure. The failure\nof the chip is an alert that moisture has penetrated the\ncircuit surface and that the circuit is at risk due to\ncorrosion or other moisture-induced failure,\xe2\x80\x9d Licari says.\nThe moisture sensor chips were developed jointly by\nAvanTeco and Revtek, and are being produced and sold\nby Revtek.\n\nCommercial Benefits\xe2\x80\x94Spinoffs\n\n107\n\n'
