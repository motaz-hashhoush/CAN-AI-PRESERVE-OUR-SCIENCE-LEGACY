The proceedings of the Working Group from 1971 to 1974 and the Legal Subcommittee from 1973 to 1980 are presented. Though the Committee has reached agreement on certain points, some key questions remain unresolved relative to dissemination of data and to the need for or method of classifying remote sensing data based on spatial resolution. An appendix of texts and draft principles worked out by COPUOS is also presented.", "title": "United Nations principles on remote sensing - Report on developments, 1970-1980", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-11T04:15:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19810040063, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Mossinghoff, G.
