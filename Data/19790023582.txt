Description of the Prior Art\nPhotovoltaic devices have long been employed for\nconverting solar energy to electrical energy.

However, it is to be understood that the solar\ndisclosures of the patents aforediscussed.\nAS can be appreciated by those familiar with the 55 Cell 1 COmpriSeS a photovoltaic device O Well known\n0\nf\ndesign and operation of solar cell modules, devices\ndesign. The Cell includes an active surface 14, FIG. 2, to\nhaving a capability of concentrating solar flux on the\nwhich is attached contacts 16,FIG. 1, and a back surface to which is connected contacts 18.The contacts are\nactive surface of a planar solar cell tend to be bulky,\naffued to the cell 10 in a conventional manner and, of\ncomplex, and in many instances impractical when em60 course, serve to connect the cell 10 to adjacent cells\nployed in an operational environment.\nprovided for the module, all in a manner well underIt is therefore the general purpose Of the instant instood by those familiar with the design and fabrication\nof solar cell modules.

One such material is available as\nASG Sunadex glass. The plate 20, as best illustrated in\nFIG. 2, includes a relatively flat and smooth surface 22,\nherein referred to as a surface of incidence for solar flux.\nThat is to say9the surface 22 comprises the surface of\nthe concentrator on which solar energy falls and\nthrough which solar energy is admitted to the concentrator.\nThe surface of the plate 20, opposite the surface of\nincidence 22, comprises a textured surface designated\n24. The textured surface 24, in Practice, is deliberately\nembossed to provide a regu1ar pattern Of uniform indentations. T o this surface there is bonded a uniform array\nOf\nlo\xe2\x80\x99\nThe\nare bonded to the plate 2o\na\n25 Of transparent adhesive\xe2\x80\x99 such as\nThe surface 24\nis coated\nSaflex PT-lOy\nfor\nby a layer 26 of diffusely reflective material such as\nRTv ll. Hence, there is provided between the cells\na substantially white surface. The purpose of the white\nsurface of the layer 26 is to establish internal reflection\nof solar energy within the plate 20 for thus causing the\nrays thereof to strike the surface of incidence 22 at\nangles of incidence greater than the critical angle therefor, whereby the solar energy is progressively reflected\ninternally of the plate 20 until it is permitted to pass\nfrom the plate 20 to strike the active surface 14 of a solar\ncell 10.\nThe critical angle, of course, can readily be computed\naccording to Snell\xe2\x80\x99s law, as more fully discussed in the\naforementioned U.S.Pat. No. 3,913,994.\nIt suffices to understand that the solar flux reflected\nfrom the textured surface of the plate 20 is reflected\nback and forth between the textured surface 24 and the\nsurface 22 until the rays of flux exit the plate 20 to strike\nthe active surface 14 of the solar cell 10.\nAs shown in FIG. 3, the solar cells 10 are attached to\nthe concentrator 12 with voids, or interspaces, designated 30, located between the individual cells 10 being\nbacked by the reflective layers 26. Thus the layer 26\nsurrounds each of the cells 10. Consequently, the con-\n\n5\n\n10\n\nl5\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\n55\n\n60\n\n65\n\n4\n\ncentrator 12 serves to trap incident solar radiation\nwhich exits the concentrator, after repeated internal\nreflection to fall, on the active surface of the cell 18.\nIn view of the foregoing, it should be apparent that\nthe concentrator 12 is particularly adapted to effectively concentrate otherwise wasted solar flux onto the\nactive surface of solar ccells of the module for thus\nenhancing the electrical power output from the module,\nwithout resorting to the use of awriliary concentration\ndevices which tend to increase module depth.\nMoreover, since solar cells constitute the bulk of the\ncosts for terrestrial modules, it should be apparent that\nthe overall cost per unit of electrical power output can\nbe reduced through the use of the instant invention due\nto the fact that the cells are sparsely concentrated for\nthus making extensive use of less expensive glass, in lieu\nof heavy concentrations of silicon solar cells, to achieve\na desired electrical output.\nWhat is claimed is:\nAn improved\ncomprising:\nA. an\nreflective* transparent cover plate\nhaving a pair of opposed surfaces including a substantially smooth planar surface of incidence for\naccepting incident\nand a uniformly\ntextured surface characterized by a plurality of\nuniformly configured indentations;\nB. a plurality Of silicon solar cells adhesively bonded\nat the active surfaces thereof to mutually spaced\nportions of said textured surface and defining\ntherebetween interspaces; and\nc. means comprising a layer of diffusely reflective\nmaterial deposited on said textured surface in the\ninterspaces defined between said cells for internally\nreflecting solar energy to strike said surface of\nincidence at such angles as.to be internally rereflected, whereby the energy is caused to progress\ntoward the active surfaces of the solar cells of said\nplurality.\n\n* * * * *\n\n"
