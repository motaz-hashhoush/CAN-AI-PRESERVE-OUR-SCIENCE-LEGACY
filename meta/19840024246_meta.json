This technique investigates the problem of extracting information about an asteroid's shape from its lightcurve. Whenever four ideal conditions are met, P is an estimator for the asteroids mean cross section C, a convex set defined as the average of all cross sections C(Z) cut by planes a distance z above the asteroids equatorial plane. C is therefore a 2-D average of the asteroids 3-D shape. The method is tested by inverting lightcurves generated analytically for geometrically scattered ellipsoids (GSE's) with semiaxes a  or = B  or = C. Using a defined 'distance measure' to quantify the difference between any two profiles, the deviation of P from C for GSE's as a function of lightcurve noise level, rotation phase sampling interval delta theta, and departure from ideal conditions is calibrated. The distance between P and a circle provides a gauge of the asteroid's nonsphericity and incorporates all the information contained in the lightcurve.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19840024246, "id": "c7cb1512299745cb81f4a8c7128deb7a", "publicationDate": "1984-09-10T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19840024246.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19840024246/downloads/19840024246.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19840024246/downloads/19840024246.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19840024246/downloads/19840024246.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
