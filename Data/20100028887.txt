b'Information Sciences\nPhysical Invariants of Intelligence\nCurrent research involves a quantumlike aspect of mental-to-motor feedback.\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California\nA program of research is dedicated to\ndevelopment of a mathematical formalism that could provide, among other\nthings, means by which living systems\ncould be distinguished from non-living\nones. A major issue that arises in this research is the following question: What\ninvariants of mathematical models of\nthe physics of systems are (1) characteristic of the behaviors of intelligent living\nsystems and (2) do not depend on specific features of material compositions\nheretofore considered to be characteristic of life?\nThis research at earlier stages has\nbeen reported, albeit from different perspectives, in numerous previous NASA\nTech Briefs articles. To recapitulate: One\nof the main underlying ideas is to extend the application of physical first\nprinciples to the behaviors of living systems. Mathematical models of motor dynamics are used to simulate the observ-\n\nable physical behaviors of systems or objects of interest, and models of mental\ndynamics are used to represent the evolution of the corresponding knowledge\nbases. For a given system, the knowledge\nbase is modeled in the form of probability distributions and the mental dynamics is represented by models of the evolution of the probability densities or,\nequivalently, models of flows of information.\nAt the time of reporting the information for this article, the focus of this research was upon the following aspects of\nthe formalism: Intelligence is considered to be a means by which a living system preserves itself and improves its ability to survive and is further considered to\nmanifest itself in feedback from the\nmental dynamics to the motor dynamics.\nBecause of the feedback from the mental dynamics, the motor dynamics attains\nquantumlike properties: The trajectory\n\nof the physical aspect of the system in\nthe space of dynamical variables splits\ninto a family of different trajectories,\nand each of those trajectories can be\nchosen with a probability prescribed by\nthe mental dynamics.\nFrom a slightly different perspective,\nthe mechanism of decision-making is\nfeedback from the mental dynamics to\nthe motor dynamics, and this mechanism provides a quantumlike collapse of\na random motion into an appropriate\ndeterministic state, such that entropy\nundergoes a pronounced decrease. The\nexistence of this mechanism is considered to be an invariant of intelligent behavior of living systems, regardless of\nthe origins and material compositions\nof the systems.\nThis work was done by Michail Zak of Caltech\nfor NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.For more\ninformation, contact iaoffice@jpl.nasa.gov.\nNPO-46085\n\nRocket-Plume Spectroscopy Simulation for Hydrocarbon-Fueled\nRocket Engines\nEnhanced simulation includes code for new electronic bands in the 300-to-850-nm\nspectral bands.\nStennis Space Center, Mississippi\nThe UV-Vis spectroscopic system for\nplume diagnostics monitors rocket engine health by using several analytical\ntools developed at Stennis Space Center\n(SSC), including the rocket plume spectroscopy simulation code (RPSSC), to\nidentify and quantify the alloys from the\nmetallic elements observed in engine\nplumes. Because the hydrocarbon-fueled rocket engine is likely to contain\nC2, CO, CH, CN, and NO in addition to\nOH and H2O, the relevant electronic\nbands of these molecules in the spectral\nrange of 300 to 850 nm in the RPSSC\nhave been included.\nSSC incorporated several enhancements and modifications to the original\nline-by-line spectral simulation com-\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 2010\n\nputer program implemented for plume\nspectral data analysis and quantification\nin 1994. These changes made the program applicable to the Space Shuttle\nMain Engine (SSME) and the Diagnostic Testbed Facility Thruster (DTFT) exhaust plume spectral data. Modifications\nincluded updating the molecular and\nspectral parameters for OH, adding\nspectral parameter input files optimized\nfor the 10 elements of interest in the\nspectral range from 320 to 430 nm and\nlinking the output to graphing and\nanalysis packages. Additionally, the ability to handle the non-uniform wavelength interval at which the spectral\ncomputations are made was added. This\nallowed a precise superposition of wave-\n\nlengths at which the spectral measurements have been made with the wavelengths at which the spectral computations are done by using the line-by-line\n(LBL) code.\nTo account for hydrocarbon combustion products in the plume, which might\ninterfere with detection and quantification of metallic elements in the spectral\nregion of 300 to 850 nm, the spectroscopic code has been enhanced to include the carbon-based combustion\nspecies of C2, CO, and CH. In addition,\nCN and NO have spectral bands in 300 to\n850 nm and, while these molecules are\nnot direct products of hydrocarbon-oxygen combustion systems, they can show\nup if nitrogen or a nitrogen compound is\n\n39\n\npresent as an impurity in the propellants\nand/or these can form in the boundary\nlayer as a result of interaction of the hot\nplume with the atmosphere during the\nground testing of engines. Ten additional\nelectronic band systems of these five molecules have been included into the code.\nA comprehensive literature search was\nconducted to obtain the most accurate\nvalues for the molecular and the spectral\nparameters, including Franck-Cordon\nfactors and electronic transition moments for all ten band systems.\n\nFor each elemental transition in the\nRPSSC, six spectral parameters \xe2\x80\x94\nDoppler broadened line width at halfheight, pressure-broadened line width\nat half-height, electronic multiplicity of\nthe upper state, electronic term energy\nof the upper state, Einstein transition\nprobability coefficient, and the atomic\nline center \xe2\x80\x94 are required. Input files\nhave been created for ten elements of\nNi, Fe, Cr, Co, Cu, Ca, Mn, Al, Ag, and\nPd, which retain only relatively moderate to strong transitions in 300 to 430\n\nnm spectral range for each element.\nThe number of transitions in the input\nfiles is 68 for Ni; 148 for Fe; 6 for Cr; 87\nfor Co; 1 for Ca; 3 for Mn; 2 each for\nCu, Al, and Ag; and 11 for Pd.\nThis work was done by Gopal D.

The term \xe2\x80\x9cspoken dialogue\nsystems\xe2\x80\x9d signifies unified software systems containing speech-recognition,\nspeech-synthesis, dialogue management, and ancillary components that\nenable human users to communicate,\nusing natural spoken language or\nnearly natural prescribed spoken language, with other software systems that\nprovide information and/or services.\nThe research is proceeding on several\nfronts: recognition of speech signals,\nsyntactic and semantic parsing, language modeling, discourse analysis,\nand contact modeling.\nMany of the advances made thus far in\nthis research have been incorporated\ninto a voice-enabled procedure-browser\nand reader, called Clarissa, that has been\ntested aboard the International Space\nStation. [A procedure-browser and\nreader is essentially a software version of\nan instruction manual that may describe\none or more possibly complex procedure(s).] Major problems that have been\naddressed in developing Clarissa include\ncreating voice-navigable versions of formal procedure documents, grammarbased speech recognition, methods for\naccurate detection of user\xe2\x80\x99s speech directed toward a listener other than\nClarissa based on grammar filtering or\nsupport vector machines, and robust,\nside-effect-free dialogue management for\nenabling undoing, correction, and/or\nconfirmation of steps of a procedure.\nClarissa enables the user to navigate\na complex procedure using only spo-\n\n40\n\nken input and output, making it unnecessary for the user to shift visual attention from the task at hand to a paper\ninstruction manual or to an equivalent\ndocument displayed on a computer\nscreen. Clarissa also provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for optional visual display of information. Clarissa has\na vocabulary of about 260 words and\nsupports about 75 different commands,\nincluding commands for reading steps\nof the procedure, scrolling forward or\nbackward in the procedure, moving to\nan arbitrary new step, reviewing noncurrent steps, adding and removing\nvoice notes, displaying pictures, setting\nand canceling alarms and timers, requiring challenges to verify critical\ncommands, and querying the system as\nto status of the procedure.\nClarissa includes the following main\nsoftware modules:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Speech Processor \xe2\x80\x94 Performs lowlevel speech-recognition (input) and\nspeech-synthesis (output) functions.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Semantic Analyzer \xe2\x80\x94 Converts output\nfrom the speech processor into an abstract dialogue move.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Response Filter \xe2\x80\x94 Decides whether to\naccept or reject the spoken input from\nthe user.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Dialogue Manager \xe2\x80\x94 Converts abstract dialogue moves into abstract dialogue actions, and maintains knowledge of both the context of the\ndiscourse and the progress through\nthe procedure.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Output Manager \xe2\x80\x94 Accepts abstract\ndialogue actions from the Dialogue\nManager and converts them into lists\nof procedure calls that result in concrete system responses, which can in-\n\nclude spoken output, requests for display of visual output on the GUI, or\nsending dialogue moves back to the\nDialogue Manager.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 GUI Module \xe2\x80\x94 Mediates conventional keyboard and screen-based interaction with the user and accepts\ndisplay requests from the Output Manager. This module can also convert\nkeyboard input from the user into dialogue moves, which are sent to the Dialogue Manager.\nAnother accomplishment of this research has been the development of a\ntargeted-help module that is highly\nportable in that it can be added to a spoken dialogue system, with minimal application-specific modifications, to make\nthe spoken dialogue system more robust.\nThe targeted-help module is intended,\nmore specifically, for incorporation into\na spoken dialogue system in which, as in\nClarissa, there is a prescribed spoken language containing a limited number of\nwords. The purpose served by the targeted-help module is to assist an untrained user to learn the prescribed language by providing help messages in\nresponse to out-of-coverage users\xe2\x80\x99 utterances (that is, users\xe2\x80\x99 utterances outside\nthe prescribed language). These messages can be much more informative\nthan \xe2\x80\x9cSorry, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t understand\xe2\x80\x9d and\nvariants thereof generated by older, lesscapable spoken dialogue systems.\nThe targeted-help module includes\ntwo submodules that run simultaneously: a grammar-based recognizer and\na statistical language model (SLM).\nWhen the grammar-based recognizer\nsucceeds, the ordinarily-less-accurate\nhypothesis generated by the SLM rec-\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 2010\n\n'
