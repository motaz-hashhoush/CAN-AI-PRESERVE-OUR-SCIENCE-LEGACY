The tool was designed to satisfy a wide variety of structural, mechanical, and EVA requirements. It provides a load path for forces on the payload bay doors during reentry. Since the tool would be used by an EVA crewmember, control, handgrips, operating forces, and procedures must be within the capabilities of a partially restrained, suited crewmember in a zero-gravity environment. The centerline latch tool described was designed, developed, and tested to meet these requirements.", "title": "Centerline latch tool for contingency orbiter door closure", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-10T18:25:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19820015474, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Trevino, R.
