The surface of the oxide\nis reduced by exposure to liquid sodium saturated\nwith calcium (94% sodium by weight and 6% calcium by weight) at a temperature near 600\xc2\xb0C. A\n20-hour exposure period is typical for a sample having\nan oxide thickness of about 10 microns. The reduction takes place in an argon-filled 100-ml autoclave.\nThe oxidized zirconium sample is suspended by a\nstainless steel wire from the top plug of the autoclave.\nThe autoclave is then sealed, inverted, and heated to\nthe process temperature. At the end of exposure, the\nvessel is turned upright and allowed to cool. The\nsample is then withdrawn and cleaned in water.\nThe reduction process produces an adherent layer\nof zirconium on the outer surface of the oxide. This\nresultant adherent metallic layer is typically several\nmicrons thick and displays substantial electrical conductivity between test probes contacting the surface.\nThe reduced layer is characteristically very hard, implying a high residual oxygen content. The layer is\n\nreadily etched away on brief exposure to nitric\xe2\x80\x94hydrofluoric acid solution, producing loss of conductivity\nbetween surface probes.\nNotes:\n1. The reduced metal layer appears to form a barrier\nthat inhibits further reaction at the initially rapid\nrate.\n2. The outer layer was found to be electrically shorted\nto the substrate metal, due probably to isolated\ncracks present in the oxide prior to reduction. If\nundesirable, such cracked areas might be sectioned\nout after reduction. Alternatively, use of thinner\noxide films would minimize the occurrence of\ncracks. However, electrical leakage through the\nbulk oxide should be reduced by a thick insulating\nlayer. Limitation of time and/or temperature during reduction, oxygen enrichment of the underlying\nmetal surface, or substrate alloying to inhibit\noxygen diffusion should also improve the insulating\ncharacter of the oxide in the final layer structure.\n3. The process does not depend on the particular\nalloy described. Surface reduction of unalloyed\nzirconium samples bearing corrosion films has\nalso been accomplished by the technique described.\nFurther, substrate materials other than zirconium\nmight be susceptible to the technique, since the\nreduction of zirconium oxide is relatively difficult.\nThis method of metal-oxide\xe2\x80\x94metal layer forma4.\ntion or the oxidation-back reduction approach may\nfind application in the manufacture of integrated\ncircuitry and similar thin-layer devices and structures.\n(continued overleaf)\n\nThis document was prepared under the sponsorship of the Atomic\nEnergy Commission and/or the National Aeronautics and Space\nAdministration.
