The purpose of the study was fourfold: 1) to establish a simulation environment (Charlotte) for airspace operations for ATD-2 technology, 2) to simulate current-day departures and arrival operations, 3) to assess the impact of current Traffic Management Initiatives (TMI) on Charlotte (CLT) departure flows and en route operations in Washington (ZDC) and Atlanta Centers (ZTL), and 4) to assess the impact of departure takeoff time compliance on airspace operations. The experimental design compared 3 TMIs and 2 compliance levels. Fourteen FAA retired controllers participated in the simulation. In addition, two Traffic Management Coordinators from ZTL and ZDC managed traffic flows. Surface and airborne delays, control efficiency, throughput, realism, workload, and acceptability were assessed and will be compared across the experimental conditions. Participants rated the simulation as very realistic. Results indicate that different TMIs have different impacts on surface and airspace delay. Departure compliance indicates partial benefits to sector complexity and controller workload. This simulation will provide an initial assessment of the tactical scheduling problems that the ATD-2 technology will address in the near term.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20160014535, "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "Federal Aviation Agency", "location": "Washington, DC, United States"}}, "meetingId": "aebd8ba2bf254311a3a3b8fea1c23650", "id": "71b911508589437896aaeb17c749b423"}], "name": "ATD-2 CEED HITL Results Briefing to FAA HQ", "location": "Washington, DC", "id": "aebd8ba2bf254311a3a3b8fea1c23650", "startDate": "2016-03-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20160014535, "id": "be1c5c8d9cf5453c8daaab57576b7fab", "publicationDate": "2016-03-28T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20160014535.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20160014535/downloads/20160014535.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20160014535/downloads/20160014535.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20160014535/downloads/20160014535.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
