b'ASTEROID LIGHTCURVE INVERSION\nSteven J. Ostro, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, CA 91109\nRobert Connelly, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY 14853\nOne of the most fundamental physical properties of any asteroid is its\nshape, i.e., its dimensions. Lightcurves provide the only source of shape\ninformation for most asteroids. Unfortunately, the functional form of a\nlightcurve is determined by the viewing/illumination geometry ("VIG") and\nthe asteroid\'s light-scattering characteristics as well as its shape, and\nin general it is impossible to determine an asteroid\'s shape from\nlightcurves (1). The best one can do is to derive a shape constraint that\nis useful and takes advantage of all the information in the lightcurve.\nWe have introduced a technique called convex-profile inversion (CPI)\nthat obtains a convex profile, P , from any lightcurve (2). If certain\nideal conditions are satisfied, then P is an estimator for the asteroid\'s\n"mean cross section", C, a convex set-defined as the average of ali cross\n()\nsections C z cut by planes a distance z above the asteroid\'s equatorial\nplane. C is therefore a 2-D average of the asteroid\'s 3-D shape. The\nideal conditions are that (A) all C(z) are convex; (b) the asteroid\'s\nscattering law is geometric, so brightness is proportional to the\nprojected visible, illuminated area; (C) the VIG is equatorial, i.e., the\nasteroid-centered declinations SE and SS of the Earth and Sun are zero;\n(D) the solar phase angle 4 z 0.\nThe first three conditions are unlikely to ever be satisfied exactly,\nbut the issue here is the extent to which their violation degrades the\nvalidity of g as an estimator for C . Laboratory simulations suggest that\nmodest, "topographic" concavities play a relatively minor role in\nSimilarly, numerical\ndetermining the form of a lightcurve (3).\nexperiments indicate that systematic errors introduced by small (severaldegree) violation of Condition C are not severe (4).\nThe bulk of\navailable polarimetric and spectrophotometric data show that whereas\n"hemispheric" albedo variations can be detected at about the several\npercent level for several asteroids [e.g., (5)], the forms of most\nbroadband optical lightcurves seem less sensitive to surface heterogeneity\nthan to gross asteroidal shape.\nGeometric scattering is expected to be an excellent approximation\nclose to opposition ( 6 ) , but a poor approximation far from opposition (7).\nThis is an unfortunate circumstance, because CPI\'s ability to reveal odd\nharmonics in g improves as 4 increases. The systematic error introduced\nby non-geometric scattering will depend on the 3-dimensional shape as well\nas on the VIG. Hence, the nature and magnitude of this error will be to\ninvert several lightcurves obtained under nearly ideal VIG but at a\nvariety of solar phase angles, use the weighted mean profile as an\nestimate of C, and use the variance in the profiles to gauge hte severity\nof systematic error.\nWhat can an opposition lightcurve tell us about an asteroid\'s shape?\nAt 4 = 0, CPI yields a profile gS as an estimator for CS, the\n"symmetrization" and the ratio ,6, of the profile\'s maximum breadth to its\nminimum breadth, remain intact.) Moreover, Condition A need not hold at\nopposition, and if it does not, then CS is the symmetrization of the\nasteroid\'s mean convex envelope, or "hull".\n\nOpportunities for reliable estimation of CS should be much more\nabundant than those for estimation for C for several reasons. First, the\nVIG required for reliable estimation f; CS occurs much more frequently\nthan that for estimation of C. Second, to assess how close the VIG is to\nideal, we want to know the direction of the asteroid\'s spin vector when\nestimating C, but we just need to know the direction of the asteroid\'s\nwhen estimating CS. Third, as noted above, geometric\nline of equ&oxes\nscattering is most valid close to opposition. Finally, as shown by\nRussell (I), it is easy to test the hypothesis that the ideal conditions\nrequired for reliable estimation of CS (SE = SS = #I = 0 and geometric\nscattering) actually hold; if the lightcurve has any odd harmonics, the\nconditions are violated.\nC\n-S is the symmetrized average of all C(z) and constitutes the optical\nextraction of shape information from an opposition lightcurve, just as C\nconstitutes the optimal extraction of shape information from a nonopposition lightcurve. If an estimate of C were free of systematic\nerrors, its symmetrization would look the same as an estimate of CS, so we\ncan use opposition lightcurves to qualify the interpretation of nonopposition lightcurves.\nThis profile is our estimate of CS for\nasteroid 624 Hektor from CPI of a\nDunlap and\nlightcurve obtained by\n\'\n4\nThe pole\nGehrels (8) at #I - .\ndirections estimated by those authors\nand by Magnusson (9) indicate that ISE 1 ,\nlSSl < 1\n0\n\'\n.\nThe constancy of Hektor\'s\ncolor indices with rotational phase (8)\nresults of Russell\'s Fourier test, and\nthe goodness of fit of CPI\'s model\nlightcurve to the data concur in\nsupporting the expected high reliability\nof this estimate.\nThe profile has P = 2.5 and is distinctly non-elliptical. Since the\nmean cross section of an ellipsoid rotating about a principal axis is an\nellipse, our results suggest that neither the asteroid nor its convex hull\nare ellipsoids. On the other hand, our results are quite consistent with\nmany other models for Hektor\'s 3-D shape, including a cylinder with\nrounded ends (8), a dumbbell (lo), and various binary configurations.\nREFERENCES: 1) Russell H.N.
