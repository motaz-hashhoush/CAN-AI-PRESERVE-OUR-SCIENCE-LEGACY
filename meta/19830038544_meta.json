Included in the study were a variety of communications traffic characteristics as well as projections of the cost of C and Ku band satellite systems through the year 2000. In connection with the considered study, a total of 15 major study tasks and subtasks were undertaken and were all interrelated in various ways. The telecommunications service forecasts were concerned with a total of 21 data services, 5 voice services, and 5 video services. The traffic volumes within the U.S. for the three basic services were projected for three time periods. It is found that the fixed frequency allocation for domestic satellites combined with potential interference from adjacent satellites means a near term lack of orbital positions above the U.S.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"submissionId": 19830038544, "endDate": "1981-12-03T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "U.
