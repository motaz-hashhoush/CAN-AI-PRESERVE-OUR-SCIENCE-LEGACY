With the advent of advanced X-ray sources and methods the question of size has rapidly dwindled, almost to the point where if one can see the crystal then it was big enough. Quality is another issue, and major national and commercial efforts were established to take advantage of the microgravity environment in an effort to obtain higher quality crystals. Studies of the macromolecule crystallization process were carried out in many labs in an effort to understand what affected the resultant crystal quality on Earth, and how microgravity improved the process. While technological improvements are resulting in a diminishing of the minimum crystal size required, neutron diffraction structural studies still require considerably larger crystals, by several orders of magnitude, than X-ray studies. From a crystal growth physics perspective there is no reason why these 'large' crystals cannot be obtained: the question is generally more one of supply than limitations mechanism. This talk will discuss our laboratory s current model for macromolecule crystal growth, with highlights pertaining to the growth of crystals suitable for neutron diffraction studies.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"country": "Japan", "submissionId": 20030113046, "endDate": "2003-11-21T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "5th International Symposium on Organized Research Combination System", "location": "Ibaraki", "id": "d3150896897d427a9de46e5a1fb197be", "startDate": "2003-11-19T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20030113046, "id": "0296eca44f3a46c5b4073c90ba06c0c7", "publicationDate": "2003-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
