The light source, manufactured by Quantum Devices, Inc., is not very hot, although it generates high intensity radiation. When Ron Ignatius, an industrial partner of WCSAR, realized that terrestrial plant research lighting was not energy efficient enough for space use, he and WCSAR began to experiment with light emitting diodes. A line of LED products was developed, and QDI was formed to market the technology. An LED-based cancer treatment device is currently under development.", "title": "Light Source", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-20T23:09:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-09-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20020080942, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20020080942, "isbn": "0-16-042100-4", "id": "27d8756f4f1940638fb26e0986b8e390", "publicationName": "Spinoff 1993", "publicationDate": "1993-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20020080942.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20020080942/downloads/20020080942.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20020080942/downloads/20020080942.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20020080942/downloads/20020080942.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
