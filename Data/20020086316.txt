b'Smal Business Innovations\nA special research and\ndevelopment program for\nsmall businesses is expanding\n\nI\n\ntheir pam\'cipation in\naerospace technology\ndevelopment and transfer\nThe Small Business\nInnovation Research\n(SBIR) program was\nestablished by Congress\nin 1982. Its dual\nobjectives were to\nincrease participation of\nsmall businesses in\nfederal high technology\nresearch and\ndevelopment activities,\nand to stimulate\nconversion of\ngovernment-funded\nresearch into commercial\napplications. The\nprogram has been\neminently successful in\nattaining both objectives.

The agency evaluates the proposal from the\nstandpoint of potential usefulness to NASA and the\npotential for becoming a commercial product or\nprocess. The best concepts are rewarded with sixmonth Phase I contracts for up to $50,000, under\nwhich the company determines the technical\nfeasibility of the innovation it has proposed.\nPhase I1 contracts are awarded competitively\nfrom proposals - submitted by Phase I contractors\n- that include the results of Phase I research; about\nhalf of the Phase I projects continue into Phase 11,\nwhich can run as long as two years and be funded\nup to $500,000.\nIn Phase 111, the small business participant may\napply the results of Phase 1/11 research to\ndevelopment of a product or process for the\ncommercial market, using private capital to do so.\nPhase I11 may also involve NASA\'s continued\ndevelopment and purchase for its own use of the\nproducts of Phase I1 - but NASA may not use SBIR\nset-aside funds for such purposes.\nA NASA/SBIR project conducted by\nFemtometrics, Costa Mesa, California illustrates how\na company conceived and developed an advanced\ninstrument for government research, then adapted\nthe same technology to creation of a commercial\nproduct of importance in the industrial workplace.\nSince 1979, Langley Research Center has been\nusing a NASA-developed instrument known as the\nQCM (short for quartz crystal microbalance cascade\nimpactor) for collection and measurement of aerosol\nparticles in the upper atmosphere. The system\ndetects aerosols -tiny solid particles or liquid\ndroplets - that collect on the quartz crystal,\nsegregates them in 10 size categories and weighs\nthem, providing information to environmental\nresearchers on the size distribution and mass\nconcentration of aerosols in the atmosphere.\nFemtometrics responded to NASA\'s SBIR\nsolicitation with a proposal for an advanced, much\nmore sensitive aerosol detector to meet a perceived\nneed for measurement of extremely low\nconcentrations of aerosols and detection of submicron particles in clean rooms where aerospace\nsystems are assembled. The proposal won\nFemtometrics a Langley Research Center Phase I\nSBIR contract and the results led to Phase I1\ndevelopment of the instrument.\nThe resulting product is described as "the next\ngeneration of aerosol mass microbalance\n\ntechnology," an instrument of extreme sensitivity due\nto use of a new type of sensor, the surface acoustic\nwave (SAW) piezoelectric crystal. It offers a mass\nresolution two orders of magnitude greater than the\ncrystal in the QCM.\nFemtometrics used the technology to develop a\ncommercial product, the Model 200-1 SAW Mass\nMicrobalance, which provides a 400-fold increase in\nmass sensitivity per unit area over the conventional\nbulk crystal microbalance. The instrument can be\nused for real-time particle monitoring in clean rooms.\nIt also has utility in measurement of chemical vapors\nin very low concentrations; the SAW crystal is coated\nwith a t h chemical film that reacts with and detects\nthe particular vapor. This provides a means of\nmeasuring target chemicals in the stratosphere that\nare of interest to environmental researchers because\nof the key roles of these chemicals in climate and\nstratospheric chemical composition. The same\ntechnology enables detection of toxic chemicals in\nthe industrial environment; the small size, low cost\nand hlgh sensitivity of the Model 200-1 SAW Mass\nMicrobalance makes the instrument attractive for use\nas an industrial toxic vapor monitor.\n(Continued)\n\nShown above is the\nfingernoikize sensor\nunit located in the\ncylinder atop the\ninstrument; it is\noctually two seporote\ncrystals, one the active\nsensor, the other a\nreference.\n\nRoss-Hime Designs, Inc. developed\nthe Omni-Wrist robotic arm with\nhumonlike dexterity and greoterthan-human range of motion.\nPrologue\n\nS d Businesslmvatkns\n(Continued)\n\nSBIR work by Epitaxx,\nInc. led to commercial\ndevelopment of these\nhigh performance\ninfrared\nphotodetectonfor\nremote sensing, fiber\noptics and other\napplications.\n\nSince 1983, when\nNASA initiated its SBIR\nprogram, the agency has\nsponsored more than\n1,500 Phase I projects\nhandled by 765\ncompanies; by mid-1331,\n632 of those projects had\nproceeded into Phase I1\nwith 377 firms\nparticipating.\nNASA has obligated\na total of $348 million\nfor SBIR contracts, which\nare managed by NASA\nfield installations as part\nof their overall R&D\nactivities. Nearly 300\nPhase I1 projects have\nbeen completed and\nroughly half of the\ninnovations produced have been used in NASA\nprograms or are planned for use. The bottom line,\nfrom the standpoint of economic benefit, is that\nabout a third of the completed projects have\ngenerated commercial applications.\nHere are some examples:\nRoss-Hime Designs, Inc.,\nMinneapolis, Minnesota\ndeveloped what\ncompany literature calls\n"the first successful\nsingularity-free highprecision (robotic)\nwrist." Singularity is a\nphenomenon of robotics\nthat can cause a joint to\njam as it attempts to move in an area where it has no\naxis of rotation or range of motion; singularity can\ncause damage to equipment or tooling.\nUnder a Langley Research Center SBIR contract,\nRoss-Hirne developed a commercially available\nOmni-Wrist" actuator, which has a 25-pound\ncapacity, 180 degrees of pitchlyaw and 360 degrees\nof roll (another version, Omni-Wrist 11, offers a 100pound load capacity and the same range of motion).\nApplications include spray painting, sealing,\nultrasonic testing, welding and a variety of nuclear\nindustry, aerospace and military uses.\nEpitaxx, Inc., Princeton, New Jersey received a\nGoddard Space Flight Center SBIR contract to\n\ndevelop a linear detector\narray for satellite\nimaging applications.\nThe array employs\nindium-gallium-arsenide\nalloys and can operate\nat room temperature;\nearlier detectors have to\nbe cooled to extremely\nlow (cryogenic)\ntemperatures and that is\nboth difficult and\nexpensive.\nEpitaxx used the\nsame technology to\ncreate a series of\ncommercial products,\nincluding the Epitaxx\nNear Infrared Room\nTemperature IndiumGallium-Arsenide\nPhotodetectors. The basic device is a photodetector\nthat provides an electrical signal when it is exposed\nto a scene that radiates energy in the near infrared. It\nhas applications as a laboratory tool for generating\noptical spectra, and for remote sensing, fiber optic\nand laser position-sensing applications.\n\nI\nL\n\nProducts ot SHIR research by Scientitic Materials, Inc. ore these crystal\ncomponents for solid sbte losen.\nFor Kennedy Space Center, General Pneumatics\nCorporation, Scottsdale, Arizona developed a special\nJoule-Thomson UT) expansion valve that is far less\nsusceptible to clogging by particles or condensed\ncontaminants in the flow than are conventionalJT\nvalves. The company employed the technology in a\ncommercial anti-clogging cryostat that liquefies gases\nby expansion from high pressure through a nozzle to\nproduce cryorefrigeration. The cryostat is combined\n\nemployee of lightwove\nElectronics is holding o Series 122\nMISER ring loser, which has\napplications in fiber sensing,\ncommunications and laser radar.\n\nI\nGeneral Pneumatics Corporation\'s participation in a NASA SBIR project resulted in two commerciol products: a nonilogging cryostat (left) to\nliquefy gases for extremely low temperature cryorefrigeration, and the cryocooler (right) used to generate cryogenic cooling for infrared sensors,\nsuperconductors, supercooled electronics and cryosurgery.\n\nwith the company\'s non-contaminating compressor\nin another General Pneumatics commercial product,\na closed cycle Linde-Hampson cryocooler used to\ngenerate cryogenic cooling for infrared sensors,\nsuper conductors, supercooled electronics and\ncryosurgery.\nLightwave Electronics Corporation, Mountain\nView, California, received an SBIR contract from Jet\nPropulsion Laboratory for a Prototype Laser Diodepumped Solid State Transmitter. The company\ndelivered a low noise ring laser with voltage tuning\nthat could be used as a local oscillator in an optical\ncommunications system. The voltage tuning feature\nallows "phase-locking"the lasers, making them\n"electronic",similar to radio and microwave\nelectronic oscillators. From this technology,\nLightwave developed the Series 120 and 122 nonplanar diode pumped ring lasers for applications in\nfiber sensing, coherent communications and laser\nradar.\nFoster-Miller, Inc., Waltham, Massachusetts, in\nSBIR cooperation with Langley Research Center,\ndeveloped the first analytical system capable of\ndirectly measuring the chemistry of advanced\ncomposite materials. It employs an infrared fiber\noptic sensor, embedded in the composite material, to\ntrack the molecular vibrational characteristics of a\ncomposite part while it is being cured in a press or\nan autoclave. Thus, says a company official, it\n"provides first hand information about chemical\nreactions as opposed to measuring a secondary\nchange." The patented In Situ Fiber Optic Polymer\n\naward, could lead to\nsignificantly higher yields\nin the manufacture of\ncomplex composite\nparts, with consequent\nreduction in cost. It is\nexpected to find broad\nresearch and commercial\nutility in aerospace,\nindustrial and\nenvironmental\napplications.\nScientific Materials Corporation (SM), Bozeman,\nMontana, under a Langley SBIR contract, developed\na SciMax" line of improved Nd:YAG crystals for laser\nand electro-optic applications (Nd:YAG is short for\nthe materials involved - neodymium, the dopant,\nwith yttrium aluminum garnet). SM\'s research\nprovided a process for producing uniform laser rods\nin which the amount of water trapped in the crystal\nduring growth is reduced, thereby improving\nefficiency, and the properties that affect optical\nquality are also improved for a further gain in crystal\nefficiency. S is producing the crystals for the\nM\ncommercial market; applications include fiber optics,\ntelecommunications,welding, drilling, eye surgery\nand medical instrumentation.\nWmni-Wrist is a trademark of Ross-Hime Designs, Inc.\n"5ciMax is a trademark of Scientific Materials Corporation.\n\nAn oward-winning\ninnovation by FosterMiller, Inc. is a\ntechnique and a\nsystem for monitoring\nchemical reactions in\ncomposite moteriols\nwhile they ore\nundergoing cure in a\npress or outoclove.\n\n'
