Radar is most useful in the short, nowcast time frame. Satellites and surface observations are also most useful for short-range forecasts but have less impact on the longer range. The radiosonde network, on the other hand, only starts to be very important after about six hours and has greatest impact at lead times of 12 hours or more. In the wind profiler, wind is measured by using clear-air Doppler radar principles, Two fixed beams, pointing 15 deg to the north and 15 deg to the east, sense the Doppler shift. The resulting wind vectors are then rotated to the horizontal and combined to give total wind. The temperature profiler measures temperature and humidity by using passive radiometers. Development on the profiler is 95 percent complete, and on the temperature profiler 75 percent complete.", "title": "Special observations", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-05T18:38:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19880015724, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Beran, Donald"}, "organization": {"name": "National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration", "location": "Boulder, CO, United States"}}, "id": "c161b228ed714b5ba55011cf07cfb8d7"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19880015724, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19880015724, "id": "699a1b2b909f4a8197241f99cb04f6d4", "publicationName": "Tennessee Univ.
