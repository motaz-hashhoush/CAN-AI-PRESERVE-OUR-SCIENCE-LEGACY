Raman spectroscopy is a laser-based measurement technique that provides through a unique vibrational spectrum a molecular 'fingerprint,' and can function in aqueous environments. EIC combined optical fiber technology with Raman methods to develop sensors that can be operated at a distance from the spectrographic analysis instruments and the laser excitation source. EIC refined and commercialized the technology to create the Fiber Optic Raman Spectrograph and the RamanProbe. Commercial applications range from process control to monitoring hazardous materials.", "title": "Small Business Innovations", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-07T12:52:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-27T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20020079091, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20020079091, "id": "ae1c58f6cbe64ba6bc0df036b35fbbba", "publicationName": "Spinoff 1996", "publicationDate": "1996-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20020079091.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20020079091/downloads/20020079091.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20020079091/downloads/20020079091.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20020079091/downloads/20020079091.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
