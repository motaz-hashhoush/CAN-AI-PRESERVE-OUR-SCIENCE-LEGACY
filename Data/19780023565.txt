GOVERNMENT PRINTING OFFICE : 1978\n\nO\xe2\x80\x94266-639\n\n^OREWORD\n\nFror ,, 13 prehistoric hunter who scaled a peak to scout the lay of the land\nto the astronaut photographing the Earth\'s hemisphere from 75 000 kilometers, man has always especially prized the view from above. It is the richest of\nall perspectives, densely packed with information, closest to that uniquely\nhuman concept, the map. During two decades of space exploration, orbital\nimagery of our planet has been revealed as one of the most exciting and\nrewarding benefits of space.\nYet we should never forget the value of aircraft as platforms for our sensors\nand scientific instruments. So useful is aerial photography at low and moderate altitudes that it has created an industry that serves countless purposes.\nThe unusual aircraft that is the subject of this descriptive booklet, flying at\naltitudes above those generally attained in conventional aerial photography, has an enlarged scope. It can scan shorelines, measure water levels,\nhelp fight forest fires, collect mapping data, assess flood damage, and\nsample the stratosphere. Over the oceans it can make sensitive measurements of water color and current; over land it can provide a form of\n"ground truth" that is valuable in calibrating the rich store of information from\nour satellites. Because it can do these things so well, it deserves attention for\nthe sevice it is providing.\nJanuary 1978\n\nAnthony J. Calio,\nAssociate Administrator\nfor Space and Terrestrial Applications\n\nNTRODUCTION\n\nThis publication was prepared in response to many requests for information\non the availability of the U-2 aircraft managed by Ames research Center, for use\nin high-altitude investigations that cannot be performed by the private sector.\nProspective users of the U-2 will find helpful information about the aircraft, the sensors\nit provides or can accommodate, its potential applications, and associated datahandling provisions. In an era of growing awareness of the Earth\'s environmental fragility\nand limited natural resources, aircraft and spacecraft have proved to be excellent platforms for remote and in situ sensing devices. Scientists and engineers at Ames Research\nCenter have managed aircraft-supported research missions since 1964. Experience has been\ngained with a variety of aircraft - a Convair 990 airborne research laboratory, a C-141 airborne\ninfrared observatory, Learjet aircraft, and more recently, two high-altitude U-2\'s.\nThe U-2 and Convair 990 aircraft are available on a cost-reimbursable basis for research or\nexperimental programs in such areas as Earth resources inventories, remote sensing data interpretation, electronic sensor research and development, satellite investigative support, stratospheric gas\nstudies, and astronomy and astrophysics.\n\nTYPICAL U-2 SUPPORT\nACTIVITIES\n\nWATER RESOURCES\n\nU-2 photos have helped the California Department of Water Resources measure water levels\nin rivers and reservoirs, especially during\ndrought years. High-altitude photos of San Francisco Bay aided the U.S. Geological Survey\nstudy of tidal patterns and water movement.\nDISASTER ASSESSMENT\n\nFirefighters have used U-2 high-altitude data for\nfaster containment of fires, and direct savings of\nmanpower, equipment, forest watersheds, and\nwildlife habitat were achieved. Flood damage\nsurveys can help to assign priority for repairs and\ndamage alleviation by providing pictures of the\ncomplete situation.\nLAND USE\nIn the Arizona Land Use Experiment, U-2 imagery was used to generate orthophotoquad\nmaps, thereby developing a land use management data base for both the public and\nprivate sectors. U-2 photos have been used to\nevaluate urban growth, traffic patterns, and\npollution, and have proved invaluable in the\npreparation of environmental impact statements.\nSENSOR DEVELOPMENT\n\nThe Ocean Color Scanner (OCS) imaging radiometer test flown on the U-2 prior to installation\n\non NASA\'s weather satellite Nimbus G is designed to remotely sense small variations in the\nocean\'s color. The scanner identifies and maps\nregions of high food productivity, upwelling,\ntidal extent, sediment concentration off the\ncoast, and will ultimately aid in coastal zone\ninventories. Similarly, the Heat Capacity Mapping Radiometer (HCMR) simulated on the U-2\nis being evaluated for use in the detection of\nvariations in soil moisture content, thermal pollution of water, and analysis of crop production\nprior to satellite flight.\nSTRATOSPHERIC SAMPLING\n\nSpecial sensors on board the U-2 can sample\nand measure the distribution and extent of\ngases and aerosol particles in the atmosphere\nat altitudes above 20 km (65 000 ft.). A better\nunderstanding of the effects of natural and\nman-induced actions on the atmosphere\'s protective ozone layer will result.\nSATELLITE SUPPORT\nThe U-2 has been used extensively to collect\nunderflight (or "ground truth") data to support\nLandsat investigations in forestry, water management, coastal zone processes, rangeland\nmanagement, and land use. Multistage sampling techniques to aid in interpreting satellite data have been developed through the use\nof U-2 imagery.\n\nARCRA\n\nThe U-2 is a single-place aircraft designed and built by the Lockheed Aircraft\nCorporation for high-altitude, long-range operation. The U-2 is characterized by its\nlong wing span and tandem landing gear located under the fuselage. Auxiliary gear,\ncalled pogos, are located outboard on the underside of each wing; they are jettisoned\non takeoff.\nThe NASA U-2 aircraft, based at Ames Research Center, routinely fly from Ames and\nWallops Island, Virginia. Other staging locations are possible, and, data flights have been\nflown from Hawaii, Alaska, Texas, Maine, South Dakota, and Panama.\nThe high-altitude, long-duration capability of the U-2 makes it uniquely suitable for upper\natmospheric or space-oriented research as well as for wide ranging electronic and photographic\nEarth observations. Since the beginning of NASA\'s Earth resources survey program at Ames Research\nCenter in September 1971, each of the U-2\'s has averaged over 100 flights per year and together the\naircraft have logged over 4000 flight hours.\n\nU-2 PERFORMANCE AND\nDESIGN DATA\nRange\nCruise ...\nOperating altitude\nCruising speed\nGross takeoff weight\nZero fuel weight\nEquipment bay payload\nCanoe payload\nWing tanks (2) payload\nTotal maximum payload\nFuel\nPowerplant\nThrust rating\nConstruction\nCrew\n\n4700 km (2500 n. mi.)\n6 hr at Mach 0.69\n19.8-21.3 km (65 000 to 70 000 ft)\n740 km/hr (400 knots) T.A.S. at 20 km (65 000 ft)\n.10 225 kg (22 542 Ib)\n5 929 kg (13 071 Ib)\n340 kg (750 Ib) maximum; 225 kg (500 Ib) preferred\n45 kg (100 Ib)\n.135 kg (300 Ib) each; 270 kg (600 Ib) total\n665 kg (1450 Ib)\n3940 kg (8685 Ib), 5000 liters (1320 gal.)\nSingle 15-stage, J75P-13B jet engine\n75 620 N (17 000 Ib)\nAll aluminum\nOne pilot\n\nLength\n\n15.4 m (50 ft)\n\nWing span\n\n24.4 m (80 ft)\n\nHeight\n\n4.6 m (15 ft)\n\nTYPICAL FLIGHT\nPROFILE\nRANGE, km\n0\n\nTYPICAL\nGROUND\nCOVERAGE\nPATTERN\nSAN\n\nFRANCISCO\n\n1000 2000 3000 4000 5000 6000\n\n1000\n\n2000 2500 3000\n\nRANGE, n. mi.\n\nv\n\n*6 n. mi.\n\n*T2n. mi.\n(TYP)\n6 in.

An array of camera\nconfigurations - featuring a variety of focal lengths, film types, film format sizes, and multispectral capabilities-is available. Uses have varied, depending on the specific remote\nsensing research and development activity, but include direct evaluation of terrestrial conditions from imagery and the indirect use of imagery for satellite programs.\nMore than 15 nonphotographic sensors are also flown aboard the U-2; some are part of the NASA\ninventory but most of them have been built by outside investigators. The palletized system of payload\nhandling facilitates switching payloads either in and out of the aircraft or from one aircraft to the other.\n\nU-2 Sensor Complement\n\nA\nB\nC\nE\nF\nG\nH\nI\nJ\nK\nL\n\nTIRS (Thermal Infrared Scanner)\nIRR (Infrared Radiometer)\n& D HCMR (Heat Capacity Mapping Radiometer)\nFilter Sampler\nOCS (Ocean Color Scanner)\nSAS II (Stratospheric Air Sampler, Mark II)\nAether Drift Radiometer\nSCS (Stratospheric Cryogenic Sampler)\nHR-73B Camera\nRC-10/HR-732 Camera System\nHR-732 Tri-Vertical Cameras\n\nM KA-80A Optical Bar Panoramic Camera\nN Dual RC-10 Camera System\nO RC-10/Vinten Multispectral Camera System\nP FLO (Infrared Spectrometer)\nQ REFLEX (Resonance Fluorescence Experiment)\nR SEMIS (Solar Energy Measurements in Space)\nS CO2 Collector\nT H2O Vapor Radiometer\nU HSI (High Speed Interferometer)\nV APS (Aerosol Particulate Sampler)\n\nPHOTOGRAPHIC\nSENSORS\n\n,\nNASA maintains an inventory of cameras that\nhas been used extensively in Earth observation\nstudies \xe2\x80\x94 particularly in support of satellite missions.

The Data Entry\nSystem is used to compile descriptive data for\neach image in a computerized memory bank\nwith the use of a digitizer tablet and reference\nmaps as shown above. The data can then be\n\nretrieved through the computerized Image\nSelection System via a graphics terminal.\nAvailable images can be identified according\nto geographic location, imagery scale, film\ntype, data format, cloud cover, quality, spectral\nband, etc. Selected scenes can then be\nviewed quickly and easily with the microfilm\nbrowse file for final assessment before the\nactual imagery is retrieved for viewing.\n\n-22-\n\nC ATOMS\n\nA\n\nHigh-altitude airborne platforms have made major contributions to the scientific data base and have been of value in delineating terrestrial problems and\nproviding a basis for their resolution.\nThe relatively frequent flight capability of the U-2 (typically 100 flights per year per\naircraft) allows good substantiation of data on a seasonal and a geographic basis.\nMuch U-2 activity is presently being devoted to a systematic program of stratospheric air\nsampling and analysis. These data are being used for many purposes, including the development of stratospheric mathematical models that will provide a better understanding of\nupper atmospheric transport mechanisms and man\'s impact on the Earth\'s protective ozone\nlayer. This research is being conducted in conjunction with NOAA and various academic investigators. Results to date have contributed substantially to baseline measurements of stratospheric\nconstituents.

Imagery obtained at U-2\naltitudes with its large area coverage and minimal distortion, is especially well suited for\nmapping various kinds of surface features such\nas vegetation classes, geological features, and\nsnow cover. An indication of the information\n\n-24-\n\nLAND USE\nMAPPING\nLand use mapping has become an increasingly important tool in managing the utilization\nand development of our geographic resources.\nOne very important resource that is related to\ngeographic location is water. Where water is\nscarce, it is important to identify water sources\nand demands so that water supply and water\nquality can be maintained. Shown here is an\nimage taken in the Riverside area of California\nfrom a U-2 and a corresponding computerdrawn map which has been used to estimate\nwater demands. The map was made by photointerpreting the aerial imagery, digitizing\nselected land use classes for computer input,\nand verifying selected interpretations with\nground checks. The computer thus becomes a\nconvenient tool for displaying resource allocation and tabulating statistical information. And\nonce the map is drawn, it can be easily updated to reflect changes in land use.\n\nPI\n\nUndeveloped\nResources\nAgriculture\nRecreation\nServices\nCommercial Activities\nTransport & Utilities\nIndustry\nLiving Area\n\n-25-\n\nSTRATOSPHERIC\nSAMPLING\n180\xc2\xb0\n\n150\xc2\xb0 120\xc2\xb0\n\n90\xc2\xb0\n\n60\xc2\xb0\n\n30\xc2\xb0\n\nJUNE\nJULY\nAUGUST\n\nGlobal surveys of stratospheric air composition are conducted periodically to help determine the environmental effect of man-caused\npollution.

U-2 surveys have\nrevealed halocarbon concentrations that vary\nas a function of latitude at given altitude-a\nphenomenon currently being integrated into\nthe theoretical computer models. The accompanying figure shows the measured Freon11 data and a comparison with the latest twodimensional stratospheric modeling theory\nwhich accounts for mass and species conservation, chemical and solar photolysis, and atmospheric transport.

U-2 flight support\nis initiated through a simple flight request system and approval process. This process integrates\nall aspects of a test program from aircraft scheduling to data processing. Cost estimates for flight\nand data support will be provided to the investigator as part of the flight request review cycle.\nWhen the investigator wants to use his own sensor, studies of aircraft/instrument compatibility will be\nrequired, and additional charges for aircraft modification may be necessary.\n\n-29-\n\nFLIGHT SUPPORT\nThe cost of operating the U-2 often exceeds\nthe c Derating expenses of other aircraft because\nof ito hir"l~ . mode performance and the correspondinyi/ strict standards imposed on its\nmaintenance and operation. Consequently,\nuse of the U-2 is of economic advantage only\nwhen a need exists for high-altitude capability,\ngood platform stabLty, or long range. These\naircraft characteristics are required, for example, in such applications as stratospheric\nsampling, when large-area coverage is required\nin a single frame of imagery, or where coverage\nis required over extended distances.\nThe review and operational process for users of\nNASA\'s U-2 aircraft and data-handling facilities\nat Ames Research Center is illustrated.\n\nRequests for U-2 flight support should be\ndirected to:\nManager\nApplications Aircraft and\nFuture Programs Office (AAFPO)\nMail Stop 240-5\nAmes Research Center\nMoffett Field, California 94035\n(415) 965-6092\nThe Applications Aircraft and Future Programs Office will start review procedures and\ndetermination of costs associated with proposed\nU-2 flight support programs.
