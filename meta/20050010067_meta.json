These intelligent engine technologies included sensors, electronics, communications, control logic, actuators, and smart materials and structures. Furthermore this cooperative agreement helped prepare future graduates to develop the revolutionary intelligent propulsion technologies that will be needed to ensure pre-eminence of the U.S. aerospace industry. The program consisted of three primary research areas (and associated work elements at Ohio universities): 1.0 Turbine Engine Prognostics, 2.0 Active Controls for Emissions and Noise Reduction, and 3.0 Active Structural Controls.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 20050010067, "id": "3343d10950d445c88809798bd3f83419", "publicationDate": "2004-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20050010067.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20050010067/downloads/20050010067.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20050010067/downloads/20050010067.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20050010067/downloads/20050010067.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
