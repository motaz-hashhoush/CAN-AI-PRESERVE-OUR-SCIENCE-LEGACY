b'N93-13139\nThe Long Hol_\n\nStoring\n\nData at the Natim_l\n\nArchives\n\nKenneth\nThibodeau,\nPh. D.\nDirector,\nCenter for Electronic\nRecords\nNational\nArchives\nand Records\nAdministration\n\nThe National Archives\nis, in many respects,\nin a unique\nposition.\nFor example,\nI find people\nfrom other organizations\ndescribing\nan archival medium\nas one which will last for three to\nfive years. At the National Archives,\nwe deal with the centuries,\nnot years. From our\nperspective,\nthere is no archival medium for data storage,\nand we do not expect there win ever\nbe one. Predicting\nthe long-term\nfuture of information\ntechnology,\nbeyond\na mere five or ten\nyears, approaches\nthe occult arts. But one prediction\nis probably\nsafe. It is that the technology\nwill continue\nto change,\nat least until analysts\nstart talking about the post-information\nage. If\nwe did have a medium which lasted a hundred\nyears or longer, we probably would not have a\ndevice capable\nof reading it.\nThe issue of obsolescence,\nas opposed to media stability,\nis more complex\nespecially\ncomplex at the National Archives because\nof two other aspects\nposition.\nThe first aspect is that we deal with incoherent\ndata. The second\ncharged\nwith satisfying\nunknown\nand unknowable\nrequirements.\n\nand more costly.\nof our peculiar\nis that we are\n\nIt is\n\nThe data is incoherent\nbecause\nit comes from a wide range of independent\nsources;\nit covers\nunrelated\nsubjects;\nand it is organized\nand encoded in ways that not only do we not control but\noften we do not know until we receive the data.\nThe sources\nare potentially\nany operation\nof the Federal Government,\nor its contractors.\nThe\nNational Archives\nhas been in the business\nof collecting\ndigital data for two decades.\nThe way\nwe get it is through\nour authority\nover all federal records.\nUnder the Federal Records Act, no\nagency of the Federal Government\ncan destroy or alienate\nany Federal record without\nauthorization\nfrom the Archivist\nof the United States, who is the head of the National\nArchives\nand Records Administration.\nSimplistically,\nthe way it works is that agencies\ntell us\nwhat records they have, and we tell them which ones they can destroy when they no longer need\nthem, and which ones must be preserved\nfor posterity.\n(The definition\nof Federal\nrecord in the\nlaw explicitly\nincludes\nmachine-readable\nfiles.)\nSince 1972, we have reached\nagreements\nwith agencies that provide for them to transfer\nto us,\nand for us to preserve,\ndata from 600 data collections.\n573 of these are still active. From these\nagreements,\nwe have received over 10,000 data fries. The rate of transfer\nhas increased\ndramatically\nin the last two years: In fiscal year 1988, the National Archives\nreceived\n167 data\nfiles. So we are currently\noperating\nat eight times the volume of new fries we had years ago, and\nwe expect at least to double next year.\nThose numbers\nare very encouraging,\nbut the overall picture is rather bleak. If we look at an of\nthe data which was scheduled\nto arrive in the last twenty years, from those 600 data\ncollections,\nwe have received less than 7% of the transfers\nwhich should have been made. We\nrecently completed\ndevelopment\nof a system to generate\ndunning\nletters to agencies\nwho fail to\ntransfer\ndata as scheduled,\nand to track each case to completion.\nBut this system creates\nadditional\nproblems.\nIf I implement\nit as planned,\non a government\nwide basis, we would need\nto increase\nour capability\nto handle new fries, not by doubling\ncurrent\ncapacity,\nbut by\nincreasing\nit more than six times. And to handle the backlog of data which should have come\nin before now, I would need at least 10 times our current\ncapacity.\nThe past gives us pause.\nBut the future is a brave new world. At least it requires a degree of\nbravura Just to glance in that direction.\nWe have underway\na study which is looking beyond the\n600 data collections\nwe have decided to preserve to see what else is out there. It is a study of\nmajor federal databases\nbeing conducted\nby the National Academy\nof Public Administration\nPRECEDING\n\nPAGE\n\nBLANK\n\nNOT\n1-183\n\nFILMED\n\n(NAPA).This study has someinteresting exclusions. First of all, we told NAPAnot to bother\nwith systemsusedfor generichousekeeping\nfunctions, such as personnel,payroll, procurement\nand supply, becausethere is little likelihoodthat wewould haveany interest in preservingdata\nfrom sucha system. Secondly, etold them not to lookat big science, ecausethat is such a\nw\nb\nlargeandcomplexareathat it deserves\nseparateattention. (Wehopeto engage a projectwith\nin\nthe NationalAcademyof Sciences the preservationof scientificdata.) Thirdly, we told\non\nNAPA to worry too much aboutdatabaseson PCs,simplybecausethey would neverfinish\nnot\nthe projectif they tried to find all the interestingdatabasessitting on desktops. With those\nlimitations, NAPAhas identified over 10,000databases.\nObviously,that is far too big a number evenfor us to think about. SowegaveNAPA set of\na\ncriteria for culling from the total inventory a subsetof those databaseswith somelikelihood\nthat the NationalArchiveswouldbe interestedin preservingthem. Wethought we might wind\nup with a list of the 500most important databases the FederalGovernment,from an\nin\narchivalperspective.Thatlist would-po_uite a challengefor us, becauseit could practically\ndoublethe total number of datacollectionsgeneratingdatathat wewant to preserve.The\nsubsetof500currentlyhas about900members.\nThenext phaseof this study is to solicit advicefrom subjectareaexpertsaboutwhat datawe\nshouldtry to preserve.NAPA\nhas organized workinggroups,with a total of 32 expertsin a\nfive\nvarietyof fields. Weare bringingthesepeopletogetherat the endofJuly for a four daymeeting\nwherethey will try to developsomecommonopinionson the long term value of the data.\nWhich bringsme back to the basicpoint here: what weare dealingwith is incoherentdata. It\nconcernspractically any areain which the United StatesGovernmentis involved,which is\npracticallyanything. The datawe alreadyhaverangesfrom data about tektiteson the ocean\nfloor to military operationsin time of war. It includescensusdata on population and the\neconomy,data on Japanese-American\ninterneesin WorldWar II, detaileddata on air traffic\nandon stockand bondtransactions,and on many, manyother subjects. The varietyof\nsubjectscoveredis alsoincreasing.\nThedata is extremelydiversein content,but contentis oftenthe only thing we know about the\ndatauntil it comes in. We know how many transfers are due, but most often we do not know\nwhat the volume of data in a transfer\nwill be, or how it will be organized,\neven at the physical\nfile level. For example,\nthe fries which came in during the first six months\nof this fiscal year\nranged in size from 6 K to 1.4 gigabytes.\nThe number\nof files in a transfer\nhas ranged from one\nto 400, and we expect some transfers\nin the next few years will contain\nthousands\nof fries.\nOne thing we do know about the data before it arrives is its logical structure:\neverything\nwe\nreceive is in fiat file format, because\nwe require it to come in that form. however, we realize\nthat this requirement\nis unreasonable\nand unrealistic\nin many cases.\nWe are working to\nexpand the range of formats we will accept to include relational\ntables.\nWe expect to change our\nregulation\nto that effect by the end of this year. We know that, when we do that, it will be only\none of many steps we will have to take in a Journey with no foreseeable\nend.\nThat is a brief overview of one aspect\nsecond aspect is that we are charged\nNARA\'s mission\neffect, the agent\nthe government\ndistant\nfuture.\nas keeper of the\n\nof the unique\nwith satisfying\n\nsituation\nunknown\n\nof the National Archives.\nThe\nand unknowable\nrequirements.\n\nto preserve\nand provide access to records with enduring\nvalue makes NARA, in\nof generations\nyet unborn.\nWhat differentiates\nthis agency from other parts of\nis the unique\nresponsibility\nNARA has to serve the information\nneeds of the\nThis responsibility\nis fundamental\nto the very essence\nof the National\nArchives\nNation\'s memory.\n\nNARA\'s responsibility\nto the future places us in a perpetual\nquandary:\nwe must devote\nourselves\nto serving needs which we cannot know. We cannot know the questions\nthe future\nwill ask of its past, nor how future researchers\nwill go about answering\nthese questions.\nWe\nmust assume,\nhowever,\nthat the information\ntechnology\nwhich will be available\nin the future\n\ni-184\n\n--\n\n- evenin the very nearfuture --- will be morepowerfulandmoreflexible than what is available\ntoday. Information processingproblemswhich todayare difficult and costly, if not impossible\nto solvewill becomeas simpleas gettinga computerto print out narrative in paragraphform.\n(Ashort 20 yearsagothat wasbeyondstateof the art.)\nAlongwith the technology,analytic tools will continue to improve: there will be further\ndevelopments powerfulas the mathematicsofchaoswhich will help researchersto\nas\nunderstandthingswhich todayappearto defyreason.

MALLINSON: hereis a picture ofAlex M. Poniatoff,the founder of Ampex,\nT\nstandingbesidea videorecorder. Alex M. Poniatoffhired me in 1962tojoin the Ampex\nCorporation,andwe hit it off togetheralmostimmediatelybecause I was a pilot in the British\nRoyalAir Forceand still am a pilot, Alex M, Poniatoffwasa pilot in the RussianAir Forcein\n1919.\nAnd I will recount for you onestory ofAlex M. Poniatoff,andyou shouldJust think\naboutthis story while looking at Poniatoffwhen he is 76 yearsof agethere.\nIn 1919,AlexM. Poniatoffwasa Captainin the RussianAir Force. He wasflying a\nwoodensix-enginedaircraft; I\'m not surewhat it was. Let\'scall it a Sigorsky;and they were\nflying it off somelake somewhere Russia.\nin\nAnd oneday, hewent out to the lakeand noticedthat the red flagwasflying; and he\nknew,as a goodCaptainin the RussianAlr Force,that that meantthat the commanding\nofficer\nhad decided\n\nthat\n\ntoday\n\nthe water\n\nwas too rough\n\nfor flying.\n\nBut Alex M. Poniatoff thought\notherwise,\nas a young \'Turk, " as they say, in the Russian\nAir Force. He gathered\nup his copilot and his engineer,\nand they commanded\nsomeone\nto row\nthem out to the flying boat; and they fired up the engines, turned it into the wind, and\ncommenced\nthe take-off run.\nBut I am not telling this story anywhere\nnear as funny as he told the story; but long\nbefore the thing even got on the stack, before it even started showing any signs of becoming\nairborne,\nthis wooden flying boat disintegrated.\nIt broke up.\nAnd shortly thereafter,\ncopilot and his engineer;\nand\nare we going to do now?\n\nhe found himself in this icy cold water, calling out for his\nthey all swam to each other and must have thought:\nWhat the hell\n\nAnd they noticed\nanother\nsmall boat; this time it was a motor boat coming out, with\ntheir commanding\nofficer in it. And he told me this hilarious\nstory about what the\ncommanding\nofficer had to say about him; it was the end of his career flying the flying boats\nthe Russian\nAir Force.\nSo, that is Alex M. Poniatoff\nstanding\nin front of the first Ampex video recorder\nin\n1956. The video recorder is that unit; that unit weighed I, I00 pounds.\nAnd behind him is this\ncabinet which had 275 vacuum\ntubes in it; that was the electronics\nof the thing.\n\nblack\n\nA reel of tape on that machine\nwas 12 inches in diameter,\nand white television--NTSC\ntelevision--for\none hour.\nThat\n\n2 inch tape, and\nwas in 1956.\n\nit recorded\n\nBefore 1970, people had decided to use this video recorder for recording\ndigital\ninformation;\nand such a reel of tape held 30 times 109 bits of information.\nI\'ll try and\nwith bits all the time. Video people talk bits: computer\npeople call big bits bytes.\nThey had\n\n30 times\n\n109, 30 gigabytes,\n\nmentioned\nin the session today,\nbit memory.\nA 1012 bit memory\n\nof data\n\non it. And Ampex\n\nat that\n\nstarted\nselling a system called the Terabit\nhad no less than 32 of those units.\n\nAnd basically,\nwhat I\'m going to talk about-- after some\nof recording\nsince, say, 1960 to 1990, over the last 30 years, has\nways of recording\n1012 bits of information.\n\nstick\n\ntime, as was\n\nMemory,\n\nthe\n\nI 012\n\nremarks--Is\nhow the evolution\nresulted\nin much more compact\n\nAt that time at Ampex, when these terabit systems were being made, with their 32\ntransports\nand their four Philco computers\ncontrolling\nthem, we used to laugh at the idea of a\nterabit in a drawer; it was a Joke. Well, a terabit in a drawer is now something\nwhich is\navailable\nto everyone.\nI will show you a foil of it later on.\ni\n\n1-188\n\nin\n\nRatherthan showfoils all the time, which wouldjust makeIt into a technical talk, I\nthoughtI wouldJust plain talk to you about oneof my major reflectionsat Ampex;andthat is\nhow it is that everytwo or three, perhapseveryfive,yearsit was perceived,hough, that there\nt\nwas someimportant threat to the dominanceof magneticrecording. And I\'m afraid to tell you\nthat that still goeson today,this notion that thereis somethingaround that is goingto\ndisplacemagneticrecording.\nAfter 30 or 40 yearsof it, I very,verymuch doubt it, but I am gettingaheadof\n\nmyself.\n\nThe first thing that came along in the early 1960s, probably\nbecause\nso many of the\nAmpex engineers\nwere involved in television\nand television\nrevolves around\ncathode\nray tubes-TV tubes--the\nnotion came up that an electron beam recorder would be the best thing. It would\nbe the answer to the maiden\'s\nprayer.\nAnd Ampex, in the early 1960s, made electron beam recorders.\nrecorders\nrecorded\non photographic\nfilm that was specially made for us\nfollowing servo was done by wobbling the electron\nbeam, the dithering\nfollowing and observing\nscintillations\nof the scintillator\ncoating\non the\nphotographic\nfilm.\n\nThe electron beam\nby Kodak; the track\nmethod\nof track\nback of the\n\nIt recorded\n100 megahertz\nanalog bandwidth,\nwhich supported\ntwo 30 megabit per\nsecond channels.\nIt was considered\nto be something\nwonderful\nin 1960 because\nthe terabit\nmemory was only about 5 megabits\nper second per channel,\nand this electron beam recorder\nhad two 30 megabit per second channels.\nWhat was wrong\nto be done in a vacuum.\n\nwith the electron beam recorder\nlike that?\nElectron beams don\'t go too far in the air.\n\nSecondly,\nit used photographic\ndeveloped\nand put back in the vacuum\n\nfilm, which had\nto play back.\n\nto be taken\n\nFirst\n\nof a11, everything\n\nout of the vacuum\n\nhad\n\nand\n\nAnd thirdly, it was an enormously\nlarge machine.\nThe electron\ncolumn\non it looked\nlike a regular electron microscope.\nIt was about 8 feet tall; and in fact, the customer\nfor the\nelectron beam recorder,\nthe U.S. Alr Force, found it necessary\nto increase\nthe size of the cargo\nhatch of the C-130 at the time. It just wouldn\'t go in.\nSo, that was one of the things that had us all abuzz.\nElectron beam recording\nwas going\nto solve all the problems.\nIn retrospect,\nit\'s hard to know why people were so naive to think\nsuch a thing as that.\nShortly thereafter,\na company\nwas started\nin Boston; one of the principals,\nDennis\nSpeliotis,\nis here. It was called Macrobit.\nMacrobit\nhad a similar notion that they were going\nuse electron beams to record on silicon wafers.\nSingle crystal silicon had more or less just\nbecome available\nin the mid-1960s,\nand their notion was basically\nto lay out\nphotolithographically\nlittle capacitors\non a silicon wafer--tell\nme if I\'m wrong, Dennis.\n\nhalf\nthat\n\nThey were going to lay out little capacitors\non a one-inch\nsquare,\nor maybe a one-and-ainch square,\nsingle silicon wafer; and it would have a capacity\nof about 10 megabits.\nAnd\none failed, I believe, because\n10 megabits\nis a ridiculously\nsmall capacity.\n\nmassive\ninterest.\n\nAt least at Ampex, it was realized that since Ampex\'s principal\nbusiness\nwas recording\namounts\nof analog signals or data, 10 megabits\nwas just too small a module to be of\n\nSo, electron\n\nbeam\n\nrecording\n\non silicon\n\ndisappeared.\n\n1-189\n\nto\n\nTherewas alsoa slight cautionarytale aboutthat microbit memoryin that its capacity\ndid not exactlymatch the then-IBMdisk drives. The IBM disk drivesof the periodwere3330s;\nand the Macrobitmemoryhad somethinglike 7 percentmorecapacitythan a single3330,\nwhich in somesphereswas its deathknell because onething to saythat we will havean\nit\'s\nexcess\ncapacityin somememorydevice;and ffwe don\'t needto useall of that, we will just fill it\nin with garbage--you\nknow,we\'lljust add noise,random l\'s andO\'s.\nIt is onething to say that; it is altogetheranotherthing to find somesoftwareengineers\nor somepeoplewhowill do that. So,there\'sanotherlessonto be learned.\nThe two main reasonsfor electronbeamrecordingwere,of course,that you could do the\nrecordingwithout touchingthe medium. Touchingthe mediumor not touchingthe medium\nwasconsidered be an extremelyimportant fact; andthat, in turn, led to the idea that there\nto\nshouldbe optical recordersof onekind or another.\nI hateto think howmuch moneythe AmpexCorporation\nrecording.\nMagneto-optical\nrecording,\nfrom AIphatronix,\nis in its third--what\'s\n\nwhich\nthe\n\nhas been talked\nright word?--life\n\ndumped\ninto optical\nabout this moming\nby the man\nat the moment.\n\nOriginally,\nin the 1960s, the first life--the first period--of\nmagneto-optical\nrecording\nwas being done on manganese\nbismuth;\nthat was the material.\nYou had to put in an awful lot of\npower on the manganese\nbismuth\nto heat it up to its Curie temperature\nof 4000 or 350 \xc2\xb0\ncentigrade.\nAnd then, the material\nbasically\nfailed because,\nafter repeated\ncycles to that\ntemperature,\nit changed\nphase; and the Curie temperature\nchanged.\nIt was unstable\nwould not stand indefinite\nrecycling from room temperatures\nup to 4000 centigrade.\n\nhigh\nmaterial;\n\nNow, the second phase of magneto-optic\nrecording\nled by Big Blue, was of course the\nEuropium\noxide run, which had terrible trouble that its compensation\ntemperature\nwas at\nliquid nitrogen\ntemperatures.\nIt failed. And the current\none, which is iron cobalt--some\nrare\nearth--usually\nterbium--may\nor may not make it. Mr. Freese this morning\nsaid it would make\nit in a "niche" market;\nand I think that\'s about the right way to think about it.\nWhat was the perception\nat Ampex of magneto-optic\nrecording?\nWhy,\nshould go ahead and make a magneto-optic\ntape recorder.\nAnd in 1966, there\nthe U.S. Navy no less than five magneto-optic\ntape recorders.\n\nit was that Ampex\nwere shipped to\n\nThese tape recorders\nhad 2 inch wide tape in them; the recording\nwas transverse\nscan,\njust like the quad video machines.\nThe transverse\nscan was done with a rotating\npolygonal\nmirror that was going round at 14,400 rpm, just the same speed as the quad drums.\nThey were\nwriting on a hard magnetic\nfilm with a permalloy\noverlayer\nand the readout\nscheme\nsupported\na data rate of 10 megabits\nper second.\n\nmegabits\n1960s.\n\nWe should have been smarter\nat that time to realize that this was in the mid- 1960s; 10\nper second was already much slower than magnetic\nrecorders\nwere going in the mid-\n\nBut nevertheless,\nthe hope persists\nin the human\ntechnology\nthat will get you out of your perceived\npresent\n\nanimal that\nproblems.\n\nthere\n\nwill be some\n\nother\n\nThe magneto-optic\nrecorder\nwas expensive;\nand I forgot to mention\nthat, at that time in\noptical recording,there\nwere no gallium arsenide\nsolid-state\ndiode lasersaround.\nThe lasers\nwere all helium-neon\ngas lasers; and the gas lasers in this magneto-optic\nrecorders\nshipped\nto\nthe Navy were fully 24 inches long--helium-neon\ngas lasers. So, that failed.\n\n1-190\n\nit\n\nI would say that basicallythe principal reasonit failedwas that it had material\nproblems;and in particular, it had materialproblemswhereit was not possibleto get more\nthan 10megabitsper seconddatarate throughit.\nAnd that, I believe,is a persistentproblemthat is relatedwith magneto-opticrecording\nthroughoutall of its history including today. It is hard to get high datarates. So,it is a\nquestionto dowith signal-to-noiseratio, which wedon\'t haveto go into.\n50 megabitsper secondtodayis considered high datarate for magneto-optic\na\nrecording\nof any kind.\nAt the sametime, or shortly afterwe realizedthat the magneto-opticrecorderwas not\nquite the right way to go, therewaswork undertakenin WORM,lasermelting or oblatingof\nsomematerial like tantalum. It wasvery rapidly discovered\nthat -You know, the initial discovery phase of all of these endeavors\nis very\nvery rapidly; and it is only later that we realize that you haven\'t got anything\n\nexciting and\nworthwhile.\n\ngoes\n\nIn the case of the laser oblating,\nthe pure WORM optical disk, it was very rapidly\ndiscovered\nthat the laws of diffraction--Lord\nRayleigh\'s\nlaws of diffraction--do\nnot apply in the\nwriting phase.\nThe writing phase is highly nonlinear.\nThere is nothing that Lord Rayleigh\never said that precludes\nyou from recording,\nsay, one-tenth\nmicron spots or 500 Angstrom\nspots.\nAnd if you look back in the literature,\nin a Journal\ncalled SP/_, the Society of\nPhotographic\nand Instrumentation\nEngineers,\nyou\'ll find papers\nfrom good old Ampex about\nrecording\n500 angstrom\ndiameter\nholes which corresponded\nto an area density of nearly 1010\nbits to the square inch.\nThe hooker comes when you realize that what Rayleigh\'s\ndiffraction\nthe spot on the disk and all of that diffraction\nstuff--applies\nwith a vengeance\ncan\'t ignore it on playback.\nAnd the Airy\nto make the gap loss\ngaps. The only way\nnumerical\napertures\nwavelengths.\n\ndisk is Just like the gap loss function\nin\nfunction\nin magnetic\nrecording\nsmaller\nto make the area disk smaller in optical\nthat are ridiculous,\nmore than unity, or\n\nlimit--the\narea of\non playback.\nYou\n\nmagnetic\nrecording.\nThe only way\nor shorter\nis to make smaller\nrecording\nis either to think about\ngo to shorter\nand shorter\n\nAt that time, using gas lasers, short wavelengths\nwere available;\nand so, there were\nexperiments\ndone with blue lasers.\nAnd that possibility\ndoesn\'t seem to be on at the moment\nwith gallium arsenide.\nGallium arsenide\nhas an energy gap of about one electron volt, and that\nmeans it puts out photons\nthat are around\n8,000 Angstroms\nin wavelength--800\nnanometers.\n\nblue\n\nAnd there\none at 4,000\n\nare not many semiconductor\nmaterials\nAngstroms\nwould need a 2 volt energy\n\nSo, we worked on WORMs. The basic\nWORM disk of reasonable\ndiameter,\n6 inches\ngigabyte or so of data.\n\nwith larger energy\ngap for instance.\n\ngaps\n\nthat.\n\nA\n\ntrouble with a WORM is that it\'s a small module.\nor 8 inches in diameter,\nis only going to hold a\n\nIn the framework\nof Ampex thinking,\nthat is nothing.\nThat won\'t support\nfor very long at all. Digital video recording--the\nstandards\nfor it--were beginning\nthe late 1970s; and Ampex, in fact, made the world\'s first digital video recorder.\n\ncomposite\n\nthan\n\nIt was a parallel access disk recorder,\nand it ran at 84 megabits\nvideo being sampled\nat four times the color subcarrier.\n\n1-191\n\nper second.\n\ndigital video\nto be set in\n\nIt was\n\na\n\nA\n\nAnd so, it was realizedthat making a WORMdisk, an optical disk, with perhaps I0 I0\nbits of information, wasn\'t goingto supportvideofor very long.So,that wascanned.\nTheROMs,the CD-ROMs, ndthe audio compact\na\nbecause\npressing\n\nthey are best regarded\nas a publication\ndisks to circulate\ninformation.\n\nmeans.\n\ndisk were never considered\nThey are Just a replication;\n\nat Ampex\nit\'s a way of\n\nMore or less at the same time, another\npervasive\nidea in optical recording\ncame up,\nwhich is still going to this day. There is a well-known\nlaboratory\nin Texas that is still\npromoting\nthe idea of doing holographic\noptical recording\nin three dimensions\non crystals.\nAmpex,\n\nof course,\n\nworked\n\nin that;\n\nthe crystal,\n\nas always,\n\nwas strontium\n\nniobate\n\nor lead\n\nniobate.\nAnd I could go on for some time, if I wanted to make it a technical\ntalk, about what\'s\nwrong with that idea. One of the things that is wrong with this holographic\nthing is that it\ndepends\non extreme mechanical\nprecision\nin doing the optics.\nIt is not for nothing that when you go into an optic lab that you see everything\nis being\ndone on granite blocks that are on air-bearing\nlegs, and it\'s in an air- conditioned\nroom.\nHolography\nworks Just fine, sending multiple\nbeams through\nobjectives.\nLord knows in a\ntelescope,\nor in this thing, whatever\nnumber\nyou want to say, I\'ll agree with it. A million beams\ngo through\nthat lens.\nBut keeping them all in focus, keeping\nthem all in the relative positions\nrequires\na dimensional\nstability\nand a vibration-free\nenvironment\nthat makes\nit will work in any condition\nother than an optical bench in an air-conditioned\n\nsupposed\n\nI\'ll tell you a little Joke about optical recording\nbecause\nafter-dinner\nto tell jokes.\nIt was told to me by a Dutchman,\nand the joke goes:\n\ncorrectly,\nit unlikely\nroom.\n\nspeakers\n\nthat\n\nare\n\nDo you know how you make a small fortune in optical recording?\nThe answer\nis: You\nare either Edward Rothschild,\nwho every year teaches\ncourses\nwith names like technology\nopportunity\nconference\nor something,\nor else you start with a large fortune\n-(Laughter)\nDR. MALLINSON:\nAnd that is exactly the way it has\nSchlumberger,\nask Honeywell,\nask Storage Technology.\n\nbeen\n\nin optical\n\nrecording.\n\nAsk\n\nSo, what have I got left? I_-e got up there to about the mid-1970s;\nmagneto-optic\nrecording\nis coming around\nagain in this third reincarnation\nin the oxide phase.\nBubbles\nstarted to appear in the mid-1970s.\nBubbles were, in my opinion, a loss leader right from the\nvery beginning.\nThe claim made by Andrew Bobeck of bubbles\nwas that you would be able to get\none million bubbles\nto the square\ninch and shift them at one million shifts per second.\nUnfortunately,\nto do that, you had to have an entirely new material,\nbut all my materials\nscientist\nfriends told me it was going to be considerably\nmake than a silicon single crystal.\nThat\'s overlooking\nthe fact that single\nsubstrates\nwere already available.\nAnd then, if you looked at the structures\nwere considerably\nmore complicated;\nmore area\nnever gone anywhere.\n\na garnet\nsubstrate;\nmore expensive\nto\ncrystal silicon\n\nthat were involved in bubble\nrecording,\nwas required\nper bit cell. And bubbles\n\nThere are still Japanese\ncompanies\nworking\nit. We at Ampex had a large bubble program because\nwere somehow\ngoing to do something\nfor recording.\n\n1-192\n\non bubbles;\nI believe Hitachi\nit was imagined,\nincorrectly,\n\nthey\nhave\n\nstill works on\nthat bubbles\n\nIt\'s this constant notion that there is somethingthere--somenew technology--that\nhasn\'t beenthoughtthrough verycarefully;but it\'s new--new,new,new. Newis the nameof the\ngamein research. That it would do somethingthat semiconductors not managedto do. I\nhad\nanswereda questionthis morning aboutsemiconductormemory;andbelieveit or not, good\nold, long-sufferingAmpexhad a semiconductordivision down in Santa Monicain the L.A.\nBasin, and it was dedicated trying to makea semiconductor emory.\nto\nm\nAnd for thoseofyou whoweren\'tthere this morning, the basictrouble with\nsemiconductor emories that there seems be no chancethat they aregoingto everbe\nm\nis\nto\neconomically worthwhile.\nMagneticrecording,overthe last 30 or 40 years,hascontinuedto doublein density\neverytwo or two and a half years.\nI put forwardthe viewthis morningthat the main reasonthat it wasgrowingat that\nrate for such a long periodof time was that that wasthe rate at which the electronicsindustry\nor the computerperipheralsindustry could accepttechnological hange.\nc\nIt just so happens\nthat, apart from glitches\nfrom you know where, the semiconductor\nindustry\nsay every two years.\nIn other words, it is following\n\nto do with the dumping\nof semiconductors\nhas been doubling\nin density. They like to\njust about the same slope.\n\nA gigabyte of semiconductor\nmemory at the moment costs you $500,000.\nA gigabit of\nmagnetic\nmemory in hard disk costs you $1,000.\nSo, there is a 500 to I differential\nin price;\nand the two technologies\nare advancing\ndown the same sort of maturity\ncurve.\nIf you take literally the slight differences\nin slope, then you come to the conclusion\nthey will reach equality in price in the year 2007.\nNow, that assumes\nthat semiconductor\ntechnology\ncan continue\nto advance\nin density at its current\nrate and so can magnetic.\n\nthat\n\nIn semiconductor\ntechnology,\nthere seem to be some enormous\nbarriers\nto do with good\nold diffraction\nof light coming up. Once you get down to quarter\nmicron lines, it seems unlikely\nthat even ultraviolet\nextreme\nblue light diffraction\nwill do it. And you will have to go to X-ray\nlithography.\n\nmagnetic\n\nSo, I don\'t believe that for a long time the semiconductor\nis going\nrecording.\nIt took Ampex a long time to work that out.\n\nto be a threat\n\nto\n\nWhat in fact has happened,\nlooking back with 20/20 hindsight--a\nretrospective\nlook at\nthings--is\nthat every time there has been some advance\nin LSI, LSI has become larger, cheaper,\ndenser, whatever\nthe criterion\nis that you like to use--what\nhas happened\nis that it has enabled\nsome other form of recording\nto move to a higher level of performance.\nAt the Ampex Corporation,\nnot only were rotary head video recorders\ninvented\nin 1956,\nbut helical scan recorders\nwere invented\ntwo years later, in 1958. The helical scan recorder\nwas\ninvented because\nit had a long enough swipe down the length of the tape to get one whole\ntelevision\nframe in--field--I\nbeg your pardon.\nUnfortunately,\nthe time base errors of the head tape interface\nwere much too high to be\nhandled\nby the time base correctors\nthat were in the early quad machines.\nThe early quad\nmachines--the\nvery first ones--had\nmercury\ndelay lines.\nThe later ones had quartz crystals,\nwhere the delay time was changed\nby altering\nthe voltage--the\npiezoelectric\ndelay lines.\nAnd that could not be used for the large timing errors in a long helical scan.\nHelical\nscan machines\nlanguished\nin the lab as an idle curiosity\nfor almost five years, until, all of a\nsudden, I forget whether\nit was 8K or 16K DRAMs came along, that suddenly\nmade it possible to\ndo the time base correction\ndigitally.\n\n1-193\n\nSo,it was silicon technology\nthat enabledhelicalmachinesto be useful. Likewise,in an\noptical disk at the moment--takethe audio compact disk--the raw bit error rate coming off the\ndisk, meeting\nthe Philips or the manufacturing\nspecification,\nis 1 byte--I shouldn\'t\nsay byte; I\npromised\nI wouldn\'t say byte--let\'s\nsay 1 bit error in 1,000, I in 103, I in 104. In order to get the\nerror rate satisfactory\nfor audio, which is I in 1010, which is one uncorrected\nbit in left/right\nstereo per hour. Large-scale\nintegration\nerror detection\nand correction\nReed-Solomon\nand\ncoding is used.\nAnd just like in the RDAT, the rotary digital audio transport,\nso it is in the order of\naudio compact\ndisk and the CD-ROM, that at any instant\nin tlme, no less than 64,000 bits of\ndata are coming through\nthe electronics,\nIn transit,\nbeing corrected.\nThis is doing the whole\nReed-Solomon\nand coding buslness--you\nknow, working out the syndrome,\nmaking\nthe\ncorrections,\nand all of that, doing those polynomial\ndivisions.\nAnd I would submit that there\nRDAT, rotary digital audio transport,\nscale integration\nof silicon.\n\nis another\nare three\n\nexample:\nmachines\n\nthe audio compact\ndisk, CD-ROM, the\nwhich could not exist without\nlarge-\n\nWhile I was still working at the University\nof California\nat San Diego,\nrepeatedly\nask me-- the Chancellor\nand people like that; he was a psychologist\ncan be forgiven for asking a question\nlike this--but\nthe question\nwas repeated\ntoo. It is: When will silicon memory displace\nmagnetic\nrecording?\n\npeople would\nof some kind; he\nby other people,\n\nAnd I think the answer\nis clear from history.\nIt will never do it. What will happen,\nas\ntlme goes on, is that the silicon memories\nthat people use will get larger and larger and larger.\nIf they are a megabit now, they will be I0 megabits\nin 1995 and I00 megabits\nin the year 2000.\nMeanwhile,\nthe recorder\nitself will have continued\nto increase\nin capacity.\ndisks hold a megabit now, 1 megabit floppy disks won\'t exist ten years from now.\nbe silicon devices.\nFloppy disks will have moved up to 100 megabits\nand so on.\nSo, from the point of view of a recording\nperson like me, I regard\nJust being an enabling\ntechnology;\nit makes things possible.\n\nsilicon\n\nSo, if floppy\nThey will all\n\ntechnology\n\nas\n\nSo, that has finished,\nI think, all my discussion\nof the various\nthreats\nthat were\nthought.\nI_e talked about electron beam recording\nof two kinds, optical recording\nof three\nkinds, including\na magneto-optic\ntape recorder.\nI\'ve talked about bubbles;\nI\'ve talked about\nsemiconductor\nmemories,\nall of which must have cost Ampex an enormous\namount\nof money\nand for which there is basically\nnothing to show.\n\nreally\n\nAnd basically\nin the whole\nis true--that\nsick Joke--about\n\nhappened\n\nI want to just finish\nin recording.\n(Showing\n\nday,\n\nrecording\nstarting\n\nby telling\n\nyou Just\n\nindustry,\nthere\noff with a large\na quick\n\nis almost\nfortune.\n\nsnapshot,\n\nJust\n\nnothing\n\nto show.\n\nfour foils about\n\nIt\n\nwhat\n\nhas\n\nof viewgraphs)\n\nDR. MALLINSON:\nThe most important\nthing that has happene d since\n1956, is that the density of magnetic\nparticles\nhas increased\nenormously.\n\nMr. Poniatoffs\n\nAnd on the top left here is a 1956 Ampex tape; and this is a 1966 Ampex tape, a 1976\ntape, and a 1986 tape. It is pure g-Ferric oxide, more pure g-Ferric oxide, Cobalt-doped\ng-Ferric\noxide, and metal particles.\nAnd there is a I micron marker down here, but you hardly need to\nsee that. It\'s perfectly evident to you that something\nvery, very dramatic\nhas happened\nover\nthat 30 year period in magnetic\nrecording.\n\n1-194\n\nThe densityofparticles in this iron particle tapeis just 1,000times higher than it was\nin the 1956tape. Youmight ask: Well,why couldn\'tAmpexjust Jumpto that immediately?\nThe answeris that it is not making small particles that\'s difficult; it is formulating them,\nmixing them in the binder system,gettingthem uniformly dispersed--that\'sthe difficult part.\nIt seemsto take a long time.\nWhenyou havea recordingmedium like that--and metal particle tape in my view,was\nthe tapeofthe 1980s--just asmetalevaporated\ntapewill bethe tapeofthe 1990s--witha tape\nlike that with 1,000times moreparticlesper unit volume,you get--if you are talking signal-tonoise powerratios--Just1,000times the signal-to-noiseratio.\nThat means,track-width for track-width, wavelengthfor wavelength,1,000times the\nsignal-to-noisepowerratio, 30 dB signal-to-noiseratio.\n(Change viewgraph)\nof\nDR.

ABSTRACT\n\n(Maximum\n\n200 words)\n\nThis report contains copies of nearly all of the technical papers and viewgraphs presented at the NSSDC\nConference on Mass Storage Systems and Technologies for Space and Earth Science Applications.\nThis\nconference served as a broad forum for the discussion of a number of important issues in the field of\nmass storage systems. Topics include magnetic disk and tape technologies, optical disk and tape, software storage and file management systems, and experiences with the use of a large, distributed storage\nsystem. The technical presentations describe, among other things, integrated mass storage systems that\nare expected to be available commercially.\nAlso included is a series of presentations from Federal Government organizations\nand research institutions covering their mass storage requirements for the 1990s.\n\nt4.
