These include system architecture decisions and microprocessor selection. The division of tasks among different subroutines is discussed. The primary design criterion is to maximize throughput. The extension to a multi-satellite network is discussed. The maximum throughput attainable is derived. A queue theoretic model has been developed and expressions for average response times and average queue sizes are obtained. A number of graphs showing the effect of various design parameters on the average response time and the average queue sizes are presented.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"submissionId": 19810037486, "endDate": "1979-11-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "NTC ''79; National Telecommunications Conference", "location": "Washington, DC", "id": "6b663d26301445c5aa3e0e7850b1cb4a", "startDate": "1979-11-27T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 19810037486, "id": "7f24b35339f14379869e189fcdde2ff6", "publicationDate": "1979-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
