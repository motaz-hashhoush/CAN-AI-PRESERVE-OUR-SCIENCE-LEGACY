This\ncompound could replace less efficient contaminating\noils now used in machining operations.\n\nThe solution:\nAn improved cutting fluid that completely controls\nthe heat generated from machining operations, thus\nproviding longer tool life, especially in the working\nof plastics. Because of the removal of material buildup on tool edges, Freon, T-BI has a greater consistency than other cutting compounds. Loading (galling)\nis completely eliminated with a proper and measured\napplication of the fluid. Decontamination of tools\nand materials is not required. Until recently contaminating oils were used in most machining operations.\n\nHow it\'s done:\nFreon, T-Bl is based on a double-acting principle\nin which (1) cooling is accomplished by rapid evaporation of the TF solvent giving an instantaneous refrigerating action and (2) lubrication is accomplished\nby 2-butoxyethanol which provides a slightly more\nlasting liquid feature as a lube balance.\nDispensers for T-Bl are designed to take full advantage of the characteristics of this compound making possible an economical operation as well as pro-\n\nduct improvement. Two such dispensers have been\ndeveloped: (I) a plastic bottle with a gravity feed\nfrom simple needle valves, the fluid being directed\non the tool by accessory tubing and nozzles and (2)\na Gelman pressure can (Kelite dispenser) fitted with\nregulators for shop air (2 to 15 psi) and accessories\nsimilar to those above.\n\nNotes:\n1. Freon, T-BI could be of interest to that segment\nof industry which machines structural and nonstructural plastics as well as honeycombed materials. Also, this compound should be particularly\nuseful to those companies engaged in machining\noperations conducted in "clean rooms."\n2. No additional documentation for this item is\navailable.
