b'Machinery/Automation\nMiniature Robotic Spacecraft for Inspecting Other Spacecraft\nLyndon B. Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nA report discusses the Miniature Autonomous Extravehicular Robotic Camera\n(Mini AERCam) \xe2\x80\x94 a compact robotic\nspacecraft intended to be released from a\nlarger spacecraft for exterior visual inspection of the larger spacecraft. The Mini\nAERCam is a successor to the AERCam\nSprint \xe2\x80\x94 a prior miniature robotic inspection spacecraft that was demonstrated in a\nspace-shuttle flight experiment in 1997.\nThe prototype of the Mini AERCam is a\ndemonstration unit having approximately\nthe form and function of a flight system.\nThe Mini AERCam is approximately spher-\n\nical with a diameter of about 7.5 in. (\xe2\x89\x8819\ncm) and a weight of about 10 lb (\xe2\x89\x884.5 kg),\nyet it has significant additional capabilities,\nrelative to the 14-in. (36-cm), 35-lb (16-kg)\nAERCam Sprint. The Mini AERCam includes miniaturized avionics, instrumentation, communications, navigation, imaging, power, and propulsion subsystems,\nincluding two digital video cameras and a\nhigh-resolution still camera. The Mini\nAERCam is designed for either remote piloting or supervised autonomous operations, including station keeping and pointto-point maneuvering. The prototype has\n\nbeen tested on an air-bearing table and in\na hardware-in-the-loop orbital simulation\nof the dynamics of maneuvering in proximity to the International Space Station.\nThis work was done by Steven Fredrickson,\nLarry Abbott, Steve Duran, Robert Goode,\nNathan Howard, David Jochim, Steve Rickman,\nTim Straube, Bill Studak, Jennifer Wagenknecht,\nMatthew Lemke, Randall Wade, Scott Wheeler,\nand Clinton Baggerman of Johnson Space\nCenter.

The basic\n\naction of this pump is similar to that described in \xe2\x80\x9cPiezoelectric Flexural-Traveling-Wave Pumps\xe2\x80\x9d (NPO-19737), NASA\nTech Briefs, Vol. 21, No. 4 (April 1997),\npage 66.\nWhat sets the present pump apart\n\nfrom other pumps that exploit piezoelectrically excited flexural waves is the\nring shape, which makes it possible to\ntake advantage of some of the desirable\ncharacteristics of previously developed\npiezoelectric rotary motors. A major advantage of the circular (in contradistinction to a straight-line) wave path\nis that the flexural waves do not come\nto a stop and, instead, keep propaRing (Rotor in the Case\nDirection of Motion of Ring in\ngating around the ring.
