The far side of the Moon had never been\nphotographed and some doctors and scientists still\nquestioned whether human beings would be able to survive\nin the weightlessness of space.\nIn the past 30 years, we have answered some of our\nquestions, and raised many more. We have made the first\ntentative forays into the vast emptiness beyond Earth,\nand found that humans can indeed survive "out there."\nWe have stretched the limits of our technology, and\nraised our global consciousness.\nAt the forefront of this emergence of the human species\nfrom its home planet has been a unique federal agency,\nsupported by the taxpayers of the United States. NASA\nstands at the edge of an American frontier, but also at the\nedge of human technology in the 20th century. The\nagency\'s scientists, engineers, astronauts, technicians\nand other civil servants are all united in the single\nmission of exploring unknown realms of air and space.\nIn the late 1980s, that mission has a new sophistication.\nThe "easy" tasks\xe2\x80\x94reaching the Moon, flying quickly\npast the planets of the solar system with robot probes\xe2\x80\x94\nhave been done. But we have yet to build a permanent\nbase in orbit, or learn to live on the Moon, or send\nhumans to Mars, or find out if life exists elsewhere in\nthe universe.\nThose challenges belong to NASA\'s future even more than\nto its past.\n\nAdministrator\nNational Aeronautics and\nSpace Administration\n\nE\t\n\nuise as seen by inc\n\nAo[Io 11 astronauts, July\n\n1969.\n\nORiC\t\n\n,... ,. . .\n\nCOLOR ILLUSTRAT\xc3\x9cS\n\n2\n\nlk\n\n\',\n\nI\n\n4-\n\np\nS\n\ntp\n.:\n\na\'\n\nWhat is\t\nNASA ?\na\t\n\nhe National\n\nAeronautics\nand Space\n\nTAdministration\n\nis many things: the nation\'s civilian\nspace agency; a diverse group of\naeronautics research centers; employer\nof some 23,000 civil servants and\n150,000 contract personnel; and\noperator of the Space Shuttle. As a\nfederal agency, NASA belongs to the\nexecutive branch, like the\nDepartments of Agriculture or Labor.\nIts concerns, however, are newer than\nthose of most agencies. In fact, they\nwere science fiction not long ago.\nAs a federal agency, NASA has clear\ntasks in its mission of conducting\naerospace research. Nine major centers\nare spread throughout the continental\nUnited States, with headquarters in\nWashington, D.C. Dozens of smaller\nfacilities, from tracking antennas to\nShuttle landing strips to telescopes\nhigh on Hawaiian mountains, are\nlocated around the world. The agency\nadministers and maintains these\nfacilities, builds and operates launch\npads, trains astronauts, designs aircraft\nand spacecraft, and sends satellites\ninto Earth orbit and beyond.\nNASA shares responsibility for\naviation and space activities with\nother federal agencies, including the\nDepartments of Commerce,\nTransportation and Defense. Much of\nthe work on major projects such as the\nSpace Shuttle and the Space Station is\ndone in the private sector by aerospace\ncompanies under government\ncontract.\n\nAs a research institution, NASA\'s\nscope is nothing less than the whole\nuniverse. While a scientist at one\ncenter studies the chemistry of a plant\nthat may someday provide food for\nastronauts in orbit, an engineer at\nanother center is figuring out how to\nbuild the supporting structure for an\norbiting telescope that will study x-ray\nemissions from "black holes."\nSome of the work is applied to specific\nproblems\xe2\x80\x94how to build a permanent\norbiting Space Station for eight people,\nor how to design airplane propellers\nfor maximum fuel efficiency. Just as\noften, it is research of the most basic\nkind. From its inception, NASA has\nbeen directed to pursue "the\nexpansion of human knowledge of\nphenomena in the atmosphere and\nspace." This program of basic research\nextends from the microscopic world of\nsub-atomic physics to the macroscopic\nview of galactic astronomy. By\nsearching for connections and\nunderlying principles, basic research is\na wellspring of new ideas and new\napplications, and an essential\ningredient for the advancement of\nknowledge.\nThere are direct economic benefits\nfrom NASA research\xe2\x80\x94savings due to\nfuel-efficient aircraft design, for\nexample, or the many thousands of\n"spinoff" technologies that have\npercolated through the commercial\nsector after being developed for\naerospace applications. But always, the\ncommon thread of NASA\'s diverse\nactivities is curiosity about the\nuniverse, our place and our future in\nit. It is a thread that extends from the\nagency\'s beginning in 1958 to an open\nand unbounded future.\n\n\xc3\xa7l\t -\t\n\n-\n\n-\n\n-\n\n--\n\ni\t\n\nI\n\nI,\n\nNASA\nThen\n\nn October 1,\n1958, almost a\nyear to the day\nQ after Sputnik 1\nforever opened the door to a new\nfrontier, a new federal agency called\nThe National Aeronautics and Space\nAdministration was created by the\nU.S. Congress. By combining a\nscattered handful of military space\nresearch programs with the existing\nNational Advisory Committee for\nAeronautics, Congress created a\nunique new civilian agency "to plan,\ndirect and conduct aeronautical and\nspace activities." NASA was born.\nTrue to this simply stated mission, the\nagency was launching Pioneer,\nExplorer and other scientific\nsatellites-projects previously\ninitiated-within days of the Space\nAct\'s passage. Within a year, the first\nseven astronauts had been chosen. The\nsix launches of the Mercury program\nfollowed from 1961 to 1963, proving\nthat humans could reach orbit, survive\nthere and return safely to Earth.\n\n1961: The first Mercury\nastronauts ride into space\non top of a Redstone rocket.\n\nWithin weeks of Alan Shepard\'s first\nMercury flight in May 1961, a more\nambitious goal had been set: landing a\nman on the Moon and returning him\nsafely. The 10 Gemini flights that\nfollowed in 1965 and 1966\ndemonstrated key technologies such\nas orbital rendezvous, and showed that\nastronauts could live for weeks at a\ntime in space, paving the way for the\nApollo lunar landing program.\nAt the same time, NASA was actively\nexploring the Earth, Moon and other\nplanets of the solar system with\nsatellites. The TIROS satellites\nreturned the first weather maps from\norbit, and planetary probes\xe2\x80\x94beginning\nwith Mariner 2, which passed Venus\nat close range in 1962\xe2\x80\x94were\ndispatched to all parts of the inner\nsolar system.\nSome intensive scientific studies also\ncontributed to the lunar landing effort.\nThe Ranger program conducted from\n1961 to 1965 took the first close\npictures of the Moon. Surveyor (19661968) followed with soft landings by\nrobots on the lunar surface.\n\nBy 1968, the Apollo program had\nsurvived a launch pad fire that claimed\nthe lives of three astronauts, and had\nprogressed far enough to try for the\nMoon. In December of that year, the\ncrew of Apollo 8 became the first\nhumans to leave Earth\'s gravity and\norbit another world.\n\n\\\n-\n\nSeven months later, on July 20, 1969,\nNeil Armstrong set foot on the Moon,\nfulfilling the dream of countless ages.\nApollo 11 was the first of seven\nexpeditions sent to the Moon between\n1969 and 1972, six of which landed\nastronauts successfully on the surface.\nTwelve astronauts in all collected and\nreturned hundreds of pounds of sample\nmaterial from the lunar surface and set\nLip scientific equipment that returned\nuseful inforniation for nearly a decade.\nEven het re the last lunar landing,\nNASA began to turn its attention to a\ntask of equal, if not greater, difficulty,\nwhich still continues today\xe2\x80\x94setting\nup permanent operations in Earth\norbit. The Skylab program of 1973-74\nproved the viability of a small,\ntemporary "space station" where\nastronauts could stay for up to 90 days\nat a time, living, working and\nconducting experiments in virtually\nevery field of science from Earth\nobservation to galactic astronomy.\nThe Apollo-Soyuz Test Program of\n197, an orbital linkup of Soviet and\nAmerican piloted spacecraft, was the\nlast piloted U.S. spaceflight of the\n1970s. During that same decade,\n\nPioneer probes crossed the asteroid\nbelt for the first time and made the\nfirst close studies of Jupiter and\nSaturn. Mariner spacecraft visited\nMercury, Venus and Mars. Then, in\n1976, came the landings of Viking 1\nand 2 on Mars and the first\nphotographs taken on the urfacc of\nanother planet.\nTwo Voyager spacecraft followed in\nthe late 1970s, for the most ambitious\ntour of all\xe2\x80\x94close "fly-bys" of the\nouter solar system planets: Jupiter,\nSaturn and Uranus. Voyager 2 is still\nexploring, bound for a close look at\nNeptune in 1981).\nIn 1981, a revolutionary new\nspacecraft made its first flight. Space\nShuttle Columbia was launched\nupright into space, and two days later\nlanded on a runway like an airplane\nMore importantly, it returned to space\nduring that same year, to become the\nworld\'s first reusable spacecraft.\nThe Space Shuttle flew 24 successful\nmissions in its first five years, prior to\nthe January 1986 launch accident that\nclaimed the Challenger and its crew of\nseven. After a thorough re-evaluation\nand redesign period, the Shuttle\nreturned to flight in 1988.\nThe Shuttle\'s regular access to Earth\norbit will allow us to take the next\nstep: building a permanent base in\norbit. With the Space Station, a new\nera will open in the next century for a\ncivilization that, at last, has a home\noff the Earth.\n\n1979Ponee 11 6xa/Ores\n\nNASA\nNow\t\n\noing the\njob: Where\nDand Who\n\nHeadquarters\n\nNASA Headquarters in Washington,\nD.C., coordinates all plans and\nactivities, administers funds, and with\nthe White House and the Congress,\nsets the policy goals for the space\nagency.

Full-size\nmockups of the orbiters cockpit-like tligh\ndeck are used by crews in training, while\nother simulators allow astronauts to\npractice with specific devices like the\nrobot arm of the Shuttles Remote\nC-\'\n\nManipulator Syslem\n\xc2\xa3\n\nSpecial facilities calleO fJeLtra BLCa\'C\n\nUnited State\n\nTanks\xe2\x80\x94large water-filled pools-- are\nused to simulate the easy motion of\nweightlessness.

These aircraft are used\nextensively in astronaut training.\n\nwith a touchdown on the\ndry lake bed at Edwards\nAir Force Base in\nCalifornia\n\nSatellites, experiments and other cargo\nto be included on the Shuttle come to\nthe integration and launch facility at\nKennedy from other NASA centers,\ngovernment contractors and foreign\ncountries. The majority of these\npayloads are either scientific or\ndefense-related and are placed either in\nthe orbiter\'s open cargo bay or inside\nthe mid-deck below the Shuttle\'s\nflight deck.\n\nNo-\n\nThe Spacelab orbiting laboratory,\nwhich rests inside the Shuttle\'s cargo\nbay on selected missions, effectively\nadds more liveable room to the\nShuttle, and is a key component of the\nSpace Transportation System. The\nmodular Spacelab can be assembled in\nseveral sizes and shapes. It allows\nscientists to work in a pressurized\nlaboratory in the cargo hay, or it can\nexpose pallet-like trays of automated\nexperiments to open space.\nAt the end of a Shuttle mission, the\norbiter lands either at Edwards Air\nForce Base in California or the\nKennedy Space Center in Florida, with\nthe back-up landing site at the White\nSands Missile Range in New Mexico.\nFrom the landing site the orbiter is\nferried back to the Kennedy Space\n\nCenter on the back of a NASA\ntransport aircraft, where\nprocessing begins for its next\nflight into space.\nManaging the Space Transportation\nSystem requires the coordination of\nthis entire process. Solid Rocket\nBoosters and External Tanks manufactured by NASA contractors in Utah\nand Louisiana, respectively, must he\non hand in Florida for final assembly\nwith the orbiter. Upper stage rockets\nthat boost payloads from low orbit to\nhigher orbit must be attached to their\nsatellites. Astronaut crews must\nfamiliarize themselves not only with\nShuttle systems, but also with a\nparticular mission\'s payloads before\nreporting to Kennedy for the launch.\nLaunch operations cover a wide range\nof activities, from assessing weather\nconditions on the day of launch to\nretrieving spent rocket booster cases,\nwhich parachute back to sea to he\nrefurbished for another flight.\nSimilarly, crews at the landing site\ninspect the vehicle after its return to\nEarth and prepare it for the return to\nKennedy.\n\nher a California landing.\nShuttle orbiter is\nferried back to its Florida\nbase on the back of 747\ncarrier aircraft.\nbe\n\nIiii\n\nCornmerclai Programs\n\nIncreased commercial activit y in space\nhas become a national goal.
