The Vehicle is stacked on a Mobile Launch Platform (MLP) that weighs eight million pounds. A Crawler Transporter (CT) then carries the MLP and the stacked vehicle (12 million pounds total weight) to the launch complex located 5 miles away. This operation is performed at 0.9 mph resulting in a 4.5-hour transport. A recent test was performed to monitor the dynamic environment that was produced during rollout. It was found that the rollout is a harmonic-rich dynamic environment that was previously not understood. This paper will describe work that has been performed to estimate the forcing function that is produced in the transportation process. The rollout analysis team has determined that there are two families of harmonics of the drive train, which excite the system as a function of CT speed. There are also excitation sources, which are random or narrow-band in frequency and are not a function of CT speed. This presentation will discuss the application of the Sum of Weighted Accelerations Technique (SWAT) to further refine this understanding by estimating the forces and moments at the center-of-mass.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20060012130, "endDate": "2005-02-03T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "23rd International Modal Analysis Conference and Expedition", "location": "Orlando, FL", "id": "a2aed3da21fc443692fd97f8d7f0dd02", "startDate": "2005-01-31T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20060012130, "id": "d1c6af24921740e38caa4c42341583d4", "publicationDate": "2005-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20060012130.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20060012130/downloads/20060012130.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20060012130/downloads/20060012130.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20060012130/downloads/20060012130.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
