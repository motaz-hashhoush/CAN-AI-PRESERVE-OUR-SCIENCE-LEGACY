The\ngovernment may have certain rights in the invention.\nTECHNICAL FIELD\nThe present invention relates to robotic hands, and more\nparticularly to robotic fingers.\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\nTypical robots are automated devices that are able to\nmanipulate objects using a series of rigid links, which in turn\nare interconnected via articulations or motor-driven robotic\njoints. Each joint in a typical robot represents an independent\ncontrol variable, also referred to as a degree of freedom\n(DOE). End-effectors are the particular links used for performing a task at hand, e.g., grasping a work tool or an object.\nTherefore, precise motion control of a robot may be organized by the level of task specification: object level control,\ni.e., the ability to control the behavior of an object held in a\nsingle or cooperative grasp of a robot, end-effector control,\nand joint level control. Collectively, the various control levels\ncooperate to achieve the required robotic mobility, dexterity,\nand work task-related functionality.\nHumanoid robots in particular are robots having an\napproximately human structure or appearance, whether a full\nbody, a torso, and/or an appendage, with the structural complexity of the humanoid robot being largely dependent upon\nthe nature of the work task being performed. The use of\nhumanoid robots may be preferred where direct interaction is\nrequired with devices or systems that are specifically made\nfor human use. Due to the wide spectrum of work tasks that\nmay be expected of a humanoid robot, different control\nmodes may be simultaneously required. For example, precise\ncontrol must be applied within the different spaces noted\nabove, as well as control over the applied torque or force,\nmotion, and the various grasp types.\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\nAccording to a first aspect of the disclosure, a robotic hand\nassembly includes a base structure; a finger having first, second, and third phalanges; a first joint operatively connecting\nthe first phalange to the base structure such that the first\nphalange is selectively rotatable with respect to the base\nstructure about a first axis; a second j oint operatively connecting the second phalange to the first phalange such that the\nsecond phalange is selectively rotatable with respect to the\nfirst phalange about a second axis; and a third joint operatively connecting the third phalange to the second phalange\nsuch that the third phalange is selectively rotatable with\nrespect to the second phalange about a third axis.\nThe third joint is kinematically linked to the second joint\nsuch that the position of the third phalange with respect to the\nsecond phalange is determined by the position of the second\nphalange with respect to the first phalange. The kinematic\nlinkage between the second and third joints replaces one of\nthe degrees of freedom of a human finger while closely\napproximating the movement of a human finger.\nAccording to a second aspect of the disclosure, a robotic\nhand assembly includes a robotic finger having a first pha-\n\nlange and a second phalange, and a joint interconnecting the\nfirst phalange and the second phalange such that the first\nphalange is selectively rotatable with respect to the second\nphalange. A magnet is mounted with respect to the first pha5 lange and has a first portion forming a first circle segment\ncharacterized by a first center point, and has a second portion\nforming a second circle segment characterized by a second\ncenter point. A Hall effect sensor is mounted with respect to\nthe second phalange for rotation therewith respect to the first\n10\nphalange. The shape of the magnet provides linearized output\nof the Hall effect sensor, thereby providing accurate positional data to a control system for the robotic hand.\nThe above features and advantages and other features and\n15 advantages of the present invention are readily apparent from\nthe following detailed description of the best modes for carrying out the invention when taken in connection with the\naccompanying drawings.\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\n55\n\n60\n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\nFIG.1 is a schematic perspective illustration of a dexterous\nhumanoid robot having two hands;\nFIG. 2 is a schematic perspective illustration of an upper\narm for the dexterous humanoid robot of FIG. 1;\nFIG. 3 is a schematic perspective illustration of a lower arm\nfor the dexterous humanoid robot of FIGS. 1 and 2;\nFIG. 4 is a schematic, perspective view of a finger of one of\nthe hands of FIG. 1 in a first position;\nFIG. 5 is a schematic, perspective view of the finger of FIG.\n4 in a second position; and\nFIG. 6 is a schematic, perspective view of the finger of\nFIGS. 4 and 5 in a third position;\nFIG. 7 is a schematic, side view of a portion of the finger of\nFIG. 4;\nFIG. 8 is another schematic, side view of the portion of the\nfinger of FIG. 7;\nFIG. 9 is a schematic, side view of the finger of FIG. 4\ndepicting tendon routing;\nFIG. 10 is a graph depicting the position of one of the joints\nin the finger as a function of the position of another one of the\njoints in the finger;\nFIG. 11 is a schematic, top view of the thumb of FIG. 4\ndepicting tendon routing;\nFIG. 12 is a schematic, perspective view of the finger of\nFIG. 4 mounted to base structure by a shock mount;\nFIG. 13 is a schematic, side view of a sensor assembly at a\njoint of the finger of FIG. 4;\nFIG. 14 is a schematic, perspective view of the shock\nmount of FIG. 12;\nFIG. 15 is another schematic, perspective view of the finger\nof FIG. 4;\nFIG. 16 is yet another schematic, perspective view of the\nfinger of FIG. 4;\nFIG. 17 is yet another schematic, perspective view of the\nfinger of FIG. 4;\nFIG. 18 is a schematic, perspective, cutaway view of a\nphalange and sensor assembly that is representative of the\nphalanges of the finger of FIG. 4; and\nFIG. 19 is a schematic, exploded view of the phalange and\nsensor assembly of FIG. 18.\nDESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED\nEMBODIMENT\n\n65\n\nWith reference to the drawings, wherein like reference\nnumbers refer to the same or similar components throughout\n\nUS 8,562,049 B2\n3\n\n4\n\nthe several views, FIG. 1 shows a dexterous humanoid robot\nrotation of the second elbow joint L2 about a second elbow\n10 adapted to perform one or more tasks with multiple\naxis B2 causes the upper arm 22, below the elbow joint\ndegrees of freedom (DOE).\nassembly (arrow B) to rotate axially, i.e. rotation of the second\nThe humanoid robot 10 may include a head 12, torso 14,\nelbow joint L2 about the second elbow axis B2 rotates the\nwaist 15, arms 16, hands 18, fingers 19A-19D, and thumbs 5 lower arm 24 and hand 18 (FIG. 1) to face palm up or down.\n21, with various joints being disposed within or therebeFIG. 3 illustrates the lower arm 24, including the wrist joint\ntween.

One end of tendon 46A is\noperatively connected to phalange 38B on the opposite side of\njoint 42B and axis A2 from tendon 46B such that tension in\ntendon 46A causes rotation of phalange 38B with respect to 20\nphalange 38A about axis A2 in a second direction 52 opposite\nthe first direction 48.\nOne end of tendon 46D is operatively connected to phalange 38A on one side of joint 42A and axis Al such that\ntension in tendon 46D causes rotation of phalange 38A with 25\nrespect to phalange 38D about axis Al in the first direction 48.\nOne end of tendon 46C is operatively connected to phalange\n38A on the opposite side of joint 42A and axis Al from\ntendon 46D such that tension in tendon 46C causes rotation of\nphalange 38A with respect to phalange 38D about axis Al in 30\nthe second direction 52. Rotation of the phalanges in the first\ndirection 48 causes the phalanges to rotate toward the palm\n36, as shown in FIGS. 5-6, and thus rotation of the phalanges\nin the first direction 48 enables the hand 18 to grip an object.\nRotation of the phalanges in the second direction 52 causes 35\nthe phalanges to rotate away from the palm 36, and thus\ncauses the finger 19A to release a grip on the object.\nReferring again to FIGS. 7-8, joint 42C is kinematically\nlinked to joint 42B via linkage 43, and thus the angular\nposition of joint 42C is dependent upon the angular position 40\nof joint 42B. Accordingly, the rotational position of phalange\n38C with respect to phalange 38B is dependent upon the\nrotational position of phalange 38B with respect to phalange\n38A. More specifically, the angle R formed between phalanges 38C and 38B is determined by the angle a formed 45\nbetween phalanges 38B and 38A: decreasing a causes a corresponding decrease in R. An exemplary relationship between\nthe rotational position of joint 42C and joint 42B is depicted\nin FIG. 10.\nReferring to FIG. 10, the angle of joint 42C is shown as a 50\nfunction of the angle of j oint 42B. It may be desirable for the\nfunction to be as linear as the design constraints of the finger\n19A will allow. The four bar linkage comprising phalanges\n38A-38C and linkage 43 is designed such that the linkage 43\nis a straight line member between its end shafts, and is in 55\ntension during grasping. Linkage 43 in one embodiment is a\nrigid member; in another embodiment, linkage 43 is a compliant member, such as a spring, to achieve compliance of the\ndistal pitch joint 42C during grasping.\nAccordingly, tendons 46A and 46B control the position of 60\njoint 42C via their control of joint 42B. A human finger is\ngenerally considered to have four independently controllable\ndegrees of freedom. By kinematically linking joints 42B and\n42C, finger 19A effectively approximates the poses achievable by a human finger with only three independently con- 65\ntrollable degrees of freedom, thereby eliminating the tendons\nthat would be required to control joint 42D independently.\n\n6\nReferring to FIG. 11, wherein like reference numbers refer\nto like components from FIGS. 1-11, there are no tendons\ndedicated to controlling the position of the yaw joint 42D.\nInstead, tendons 46A and 46B are routed on one side of joint\n42D and axis A4, and tendons 46C and 46D are routed on\nanother side of j oint 42D and axis A4. The balance of tension\nin these four tendons 46A-46D is manipulated to control the\nposition of joint 42D and, correspondingly, the angular position of phalanges 38A-38D with respect to the base structure\n34.\nReferring to FIG. 12, the finger 19A includes at least two\ntypes of sensors. More specifically, the sensors of the finger\n19A include tactile load cells 54A-54C, each of which is\nmounted to a respective phalange 38A-38C. The finger 19A\nalso includes a plurality of joint position sensor assemblies\n56A-56C, each of which is configured to measure the absolute angular position of a respective one of the joints 42A-42C\nand the relative angular position of a phalange relative to a\nconnecting phalange. Each of the j oint position sensor assemblies 56A-56C includes a respective magnet 58A-58C and a\nrespective Hall effect sensor 62A-62C.\nReferring to FIG. 13, sensor assembly 56A is representative of sensor assemblies 56B and 56C, and thus magnet 58A\nand sensor 62A are representative of magnets 58B, 58C and\nsensors 62B, 62C, respectively. Magnet 58A is rigidly\nmounted with respect to phalange 38D, and sensor 62A is\nrigidly mounted with respect to phalange 38A. Magnet 58A is\ncharacterized by two portions 66, 70. Portion 66 is a segment\nof a circle having a center point 74 on axis Al. Portion 70 is\na segment of a circle having a center point at 78. The north\npole N of the magnet 58A is disposed at one intersection of\nthe portions 66, 70, and the south pole S of the magnet 58A is\ndisposed at the other intersection of the portions 66, 70. In the\nembodiment depicted, portion 66 has the same radius as\nportion 70, and the concave sides of portions 66, 70 face one\nanother. The magnet 58A circumscribes both center points\n74, 78.\nSensor 62A is positioned on phalange 38A such that, as\nphalange 38A rotates with respect to phalange 38D about axis\nAl, the sensor 62A maintains a constant distance from portion 66 of the magnet 58A. The shape of the magnet 58A and\nthe placement of the sensor 62A provide a linear relationship\nbetween angular position of the phalange 38A with respect to\nphalange 38D and the change in magnetic field that is read by\nsensor 62A. In the embodiment depicted, sensor assembly\n56A generates an approximately linear signal over a 150degree usable range of angular positions.\nMagnet 58A is mounted with respect to phalange 38D and\nsensor 62A is mounted with respect to phalange 38A, and\nthus sensor assembly 56A measures the rotational position of\nphalange 38A with respect to phalange 38D. Magnet 58B is\nmounted with respect to phalange 38B and sensor 62B is\nmounted with respect to phalange 38A, and thus sensor\nassembly 56B measures the rotational position of phalange\n38B with respect to phalange 38A. Magnet 58C is mounted\nwith respect to phalange 38C and sensor 62C is mounted with\nrespect to phalange 38B, and thus sensor assembly 56C measures the rotational position of phalange 38C with respect to\nphalange 38B. A sensor assembly (not shown) substantially\nidentical to sensor assemblies 56A-56C measures the position of phalange 38D with respect to base member 37 as\nphalange 38D rotates about axis A4.\nIn the embodiment depicted, the range of motion of joint\n42A (proximal pitch) is \xe2\x80\x9410\xc2\xb0 to 95\xc2\xb0; the range of motion of\njoint 42B (medial pitch) is 0\xc2\xb0 to 120\xc2\xb0; the range of motion of\njoint 42C (distal pitch) is 0\xc2\xb0 to 70\xc2\xb0; and the range of motion of\njoint 42D (yaw) is \xe2\x80\x9420\xc2\xb0 to 20\xc2\xb0.\n\nUS 8,562,049 B2\n7\nReferring to FIGS. 12 and 14, finger 19A is mounted to the\nbase structure 34 by a shock mount 82. The shock mount 82\nincludes a keyed shaft 86, a retainer ring 90, and a spring 94.\nThe cylindrical shaft 86 is slidingly engaged within a cylindrical cavity 98 defined by the base structure 34. The rectangular key 102 extends within a rectangular portion 106 of\ncavity 98 to prevent rotation of the shaft 86 with respect to the\nstructure 34. The retainer ring 90 is larger than the cavity 98\nand thus retains the shaft 86 inside the cavity 98. The spring\n94 biases the shaft 86 outward and absorbs shocks that may be\nexerted on the finger 19A.\nIt should be noted that, although the tendons 46A-46D are\ndepicted in FIGS. 9 and 11 as being external to the phalanges\n38A-38D, each of the tendons is routed through a respective\ninternal guide channel. In the embodiment depicted, tendons\n46A-46D are braided polymers. Referring to FIG. 15, the\nfinger 19A includes inserts, such as the ones shown at 110A,\n11013, 110C, where sliding friction of the tendons 46A-46D\noccurs. The inserts 110A, 11013, 110C are softer and weaker\nthan the structural material of the phalanges 38A-38D, and\nare selectively replaceable. In one embodiment, the tendons\n46A-46D comprise Vectran\xc2\xae and the inserts 110A, 11013,\n110C are bronze.\nReferring to FIGS. 16 and 17, the finger 19A is configured\nto accommodate, for eachpair of opposing tendons, a respective bidirectional tendon terminator 114A, 114B. More specifically, tendon 46A extends on the non-palmar, or dorsal,\nside of axes Al and A2, and is mounted to phalange 38B via\ntendon terminator 114A. Tendon 46B extends on the palmar\nside of axes Al and A2, and is mounted to phalange 38B via\ntendon terminator 114A. Similarly, tendon 46C extends on\nthe non-palmar side of axis Al and is mounted to phalange\n38A by tendon terminator 114B. Tendon 46D extends on the\npalmar side of axis Al and is mounted to phalange 38A by\ntendon terminator 114B.\nReferring to FIG. 18, a phalange 38 is shown in a cutaway,\nperspective view. Phalange 38 is representative of phalanges\n38A-38C, and sensor 54 is representative of sensors 54A54C. Phalange 38 defines a chamber 118 that is characterized\nby an opening 122. Compact electronics 126 are contained\nwithin the chamber 118. The functions of the electronics 126\ninclude providing power to the sensors, collecting analog\nsensor data, converting analog signals to digital signals, multiplexing digital signals, and communicating data to upstream\nelectronics. Referring again to FIG. 16, the finger 19A\nincludes a central channel 128 that extends the length of the\nfinger 19A to accommodate the wiring required to connect\nthe sensors, the compact electronics, and the upstream electronics.\nReferring to FIGS. 18 and 19, sensor 54 includes a sensor\ncover 130 and a sensor assembly 134. The sensor assembly\n134 generates sensor signals in response to loads applied to\nthe sensor cover 130, and transmits the sensor signals to the\nelectronics 126. The sensor assembly 134 is generally\nC-shaped, and is characterized by a flange 138, 142 at each\nend. Each flange 138, 142 abuts a respective shoulder 146,\n150 formed by the phalange 38. The flanges 138, 142 of the\nsensor assembly 134 also partially define respective slots 154,\n158.\n\n8\nA C-shaped clip 162 includes a flange 166,170 at each end.\nThe clip 162 extends across opening 122 to enclose the chamber 118 and the electronics 126 contained therein. Each flange\n166, 170 engages a respective one of the slots 154, 158 to\n5 secure the clip 162 to the sensor assembly 134, and to retain\nthe sensor assembly 134 to the phalange 38. The cover 130 is\nmounted to the sensor assembly 134 by screws 174.\nReferring again to FIG. 16, the finger 19A is designed to\naccommodate a glove or skin-like covering (not shown) for\nprotection from the environment and to provide grip surfaces\n10\nto the tactile sensors that are appropriate for a specific task.\nThe finger 19A includes a plurality of threaded attachment\nholes 178 designed to secure the glove or skin-like covering to\nthe finger, preventing slippage at the critical locations.\nWhile the best modes for carrying out the invention have\n15 been described in detail, those familiar with the art to which\nthis invention relates will recognize various alternative\ndesigns and embodiments for practicing the invention within\nthe scope of the appended claims\nThe invention claimed is:\n20\n1.
