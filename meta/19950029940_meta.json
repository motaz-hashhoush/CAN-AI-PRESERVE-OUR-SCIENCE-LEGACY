IDEA represents a commitment by the Astrophysics Division of NASA Headquarters to pre-collegiate and public learning. The program enlists the full participation of research astronomers in taking advantage of the natural appeal of astronomy and the unique features of space astrophysics missions to generate valuable learning experiences and scientifically accurate and educationally effective products for students, teachers and citizens. One of the premier projects is called Flight Opportunities for Science Teacher EnRichment (FOSTER) - a program to fly teachers aboard the Kuiper Airborne Observatory during actual research missions. IDEA is managed by a visiting scientist with extensive educational background (each of the authors have served in this role), and the program is unique within NASA science divisions for having a full time scientist devoted to education. IDEA recognizes that the rapidly shifting social and political landscape has caused a fundamental change in how science is expected to contribute to society. It is in the enlightened self-interest of all research scientists to respond to the challenge of connecting forefront research to basic educational needs. IDEA is exploring the avenues needed to facilitate these connections, including supplementing research grants for educational purposes.", "title": "NASA's initiative to develop education through astronomy (IDEA)", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-16T21:42:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19950029940, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Bennett, Jeffrey O."}, "organization": {"name": "University of Colorado, Boulder, CO", "location": "US, United States"}}, "id": "04d4068fcf6f4bb884c64cd442ea3c8c"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19950029940, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Morrow, Cherilynn A."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Headquarters", "location": "Washington, DC United States"}}, "id": "5a8bea739de6409e83e423b0e1678086"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Reprint (Version printed in journal)", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-19T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19950029940, "sourceIdentifiers": [{"number": "doi:10.1007/BF00982339", "type": "DOI"}], "publications": [{"volume": "214", "submissionId": 19950029940, "issn": "0004-640X", "id": "606fe51aa39b428995e3edf6e1996f32", "publicationName": "Basic Space Science; United Nations(European Space Agency Workshops for Developing Countries, 2nd, Bogota, Columbia, November 9-13, 1992 .
