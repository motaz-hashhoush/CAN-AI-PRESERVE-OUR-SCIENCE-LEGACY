The powerplant can be operated off low-pressure hydrogen and oxygen rocket propellant tanks and avoid the need for a dedicated reactant supply. Product water can be condensed or not, depending on vehicle or payload requirements. The heart of the unit, the fuel cell power section, consist of lightweight, series-connected, alkaline cells, while the power section contains accessory components for reactant conditioning, distribution, and venting, coolant circulation, passive product water removal and electric control. The proposed design offers at least a 50 per cent saving in powerplant weight, so that the total estimated powerplant dry weight including structure, tubing, wiring, interface connectors, and interface heat exchanger is 48  lb.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"submissionId": 19760029823, "endDate": "1975-08-28T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "AAS, AIAA, IEEE, ORSA, and IMS,"}}, "meetingId": "4e0ea6d4211f45538277260d73d9e1db", "id": "1ab4189e3cde42ecbb50ad74c47bd60a"}], "name": "Meeting on Space Shuttle Missions of the 80''s", "location": "Denver, CO", "id": "4e0ea6d4211f45538277260d73d9e1db", "startDate": "1975-08-26T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 19760029823, "id": "f8932cd1cf144f4ca7b2708bbe1ec7e5", "publicationDate": "1975-08-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
