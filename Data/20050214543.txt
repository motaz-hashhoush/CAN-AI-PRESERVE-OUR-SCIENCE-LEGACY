b'NASA Glenn/AADC-Rolls Royce\nCollaborated to Measure Erosion\nResistance on Coated Polymer Matrix\nComposites\nPolymer matrix composites (PMCs) are increasingly used in aerospace and automotive\napplications because of their light weight and high strength-to-weight ratio relative to\nmetals. However, a major drawback of PMCs is poor abrasion resistance, which restricts\ntheir use, especially at high temperatures. Simply applying a hard coating on PMCs to\nimprove abrasion and erosion resistance is not effective since coating durability is short\nlived (ref. 1). Generally, PMCs have higher coefficients of thermal expansion than metallic\nor ceramic coatings have, and coating adhesion suffers because of poor interfacial\nadhesion strength.\nOne technique commonly used to improve coating adhesion or durability is the use of\nbond coats that are interleaved between a coating and a substrate with vastly different\ncoefficients of thermal expansion. An example of this remedy is the use of bondcoats for\nceramic thermal barrier coatings on metallic turbine components (ref. 2). Prior\ncollaborative research between the NASA Glenn Research Center and the Allison\nAdvanced Development Company (AADC) demonstrated that bond coats sandwiched\nbetween PMCs and high-quality plasma-sprayed, erosion-resistant coatings substantially\nimproved the erosion resistance of PMCs (ref. 3). One unresolved problem in this earlier\ncollaboration was that there was no easy, accurate way to measure the coating erosion\nwear scar. Coating wear was determined by both profilometry and optical microscopy.\nBoth techniques are time consuming. Wear measurement by optical microscopy requires\nsample destruction and does not provide a comprehensive measure of the entire wear\nvolume.\n\nThree-dimensional optical interferometry images of the eroded wear scar of a coated\nPMC sample obtained after an erosion test. The eroded surface appears as a large scar\ncontaining abrasive particles in the direction of the airstream. The erosion test was\nconducted with Arizona Road Dust particles at an impingement angle of 20\xc2\xb0 and a\nvelocity of 229 m/s. Left: From measurement. Right: Removed cylindrical shape.\nAn even more subtle, yet critical, problem is that these erosion coatings contain two or\nmore materials with different densities. Therefore, simply measuring specimen mass loss\nbefore and after erosion will not provide an accurate gauge for coating and/or substrate\nvolume loss. By using a noncontact technique called scanning optical interferometry,\nwhich was recently developed at Glenn, researchers can accurately determine the wear\nperformance of erosion-coated PMCs while preserving the sample. An example of this\ninterferometry technique is shown in the preceding figure for an erosion-coated inlet guide\nvane from a Rolls Royce AE3007 regional gas turbine jet engine. Erosion was conducted\nwith coated and uncoated PMC vanes, with the abrasive material moving at a velocity of\n229 m/s at impingement angles of 20\xc2\xb0 and 90\xc2\xb0. The coatings for PMCs remarkably\nreduced the erosion volume loss by a factor of approximately 10 (see the following bar\nchart). Currently, several erosion coatings for PMCs are being compared and downselected for engine testing at Rolls Royce.\n\nErosion rate of uncoated and coated PMC samples measured by scanning optical\ninterferometry. Erosion tests were conducted at a velocity of 229 m/s with Arizona Road\nDust particles at impingement angles of 20\xc2\xb0 and 90\xc2\xb0. Coated PMCs had lower erosion\nrates by a factor of ~10.\nFind out more about the research of Glenn\xe2\x80\x99s Polymers Branch\nhttp://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/MDWeb/5150/Polymers.html.\n\nReferences\n1.
