Stouffer\nLMI, Tysons, VA, 22102\nand\nJeremy C. Smith, and Nelson M. Guerreiro\nNASA, Langley Research Center, Hampton, VA, 23681\n\nThis paper presents a search algorithm based framework to calibrate origin-destination\n(O-D) market specific airline ticket demands and prices for the Air Transportation System\n(ATS). This framework is used for calibrating an agent based model of the air ticket buy-sell\nprocess \xe2\x80\x93 Airline Evolutionary Simulation (Airline EVOS) -that has fidelity of detail that\naccounts for airline and consumer behaviors and the interdependencies they share between\nthemselves and the NAS. More specificially, this algorithm simultaneous calibrates demand\nand airfares for each O-D market, to within specified threshold of a pre-specified target\nvalue. The proposed algorithm is illustrated with market data targets provided by the\nTransportation System Analysis Model (TSAM) and Airline Origin and Destination Survey\n(DB1B). Although we specify these models and datasources for this calibration exercise, the\nmethods described in this paper are applicable to calibrating any low-level model of the ATS\nto some other demand forecast model-based data. We argue that using a calibration\nalgorithm such as the one we present here to synchronize ATS models with specialized\nforecast demand models, is a powerful tool for establishing credible baseline conditions in\nexperiments analyzing the effects of proposed policy changes to the ATS.\n\nNomenclature\n\xce\xb1\n\xce\xbb\nA\nB\nd\nl\n\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n=\n\nprice elasticity of demand\nmultiplier for airfare of non-stop itineraries\nadvertised airfare\nbasefare\nnumber of days to travel date\nload-factor (ratio of sold to total number of available seats)\n\nI. Introduction\n\nO\n\nNE of the keys to realize the intended benefits of NextGen - the multi billion dollar FAA initiative to\nmodernize United States air transportation system (ATS) \xe2\x80\x93 is the participation of airlines who are key\nstakeholders in this system. The success of almost all NextGen improvements hinge on the willingness of airlines to\ninvest in these new technologies and procedures. Airlines are profit driven entities and can only justify investments\nthat are expected to yield returns. An airline\xe2\x80\x99s profit is not just dependent on its own revenues and costs, but also\ninfluenced by the performance of its competitors.\nTherefore, in order to realistically model the costs and benefits of any of the NextGen technologies and\nprocedures, it is imperative to model its effect on the economics of airline ticket buying and selling process.\nHowever, the mechanism of pricing tickets is unique and proprietary to individual airlines and hence not available in\nthe public domain. The data on realized ticket sales is business-sensitive as well and also not available in the public\ndomain. However, the underlying principles that drive these individual pricing mechanisms, and hence the sale of\nticket are governed by the fundamental principles of economics, e.g. the supply-demand theory. Researchers have\ntried to bridge this gap in the past by developing models that mimic the airlines and consumer behavior in ticket\nbuy-sell process through patterns extracted by trend analysis of publicly available data (e.g.: FAA\xe2\x80\x99s DB1B ticket\nsample data).\n1\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nAirline Evolutionary Simulation (Airline EVOS) is an agent based model that was developed to mimic the ticket\nbuy-sell process with a level of fidelity of detail that accounts for airline and consumer behaviors and the\ninterdependencies they share between themselves and the NAS1. Although Airline-EVOS is not the focal point of\ndiscussion of this paper, for the sake of completeness it is summarized in Section II. The main thrust of this paper is\nto enable Airline-EVOS for benefit modeling by performing the essential precursor to any ABM execution, i.e.\nvalidation and calibration of the agents (in this case the consumers that buy airline ticket), so that the results\nobtained are credible and representative of the real world scenarios.\nThis paper is organized as follows. The following subsection details some background information on AirlineEVOS and motivates the objective of this research. The next section discusses the research approach and the\nalgorithm designed for calibration. The following section discusses the results of the approach and finally the\nconclusion section highlights the findings and the usefulness of this approach in other contexts.\n\nII. Background Information on Airline Evolutionary Simulartion (Airline EVOS)\nAs mentioned previously, the ticket pricing mechanism for each airline is a business sensitive information, and\nthis strategy for dynamic ticket pricing is unique for each airline. Airline-EVOS is an agent-based model that\nsimulates the ticket buy-sell process by mimicing airlines and consumer behaviors, through patterns extracted by\ntrend analysis of publicly available data. The intended use of Airline-EVOS is to explore how changes\xe2\x80\x94regulatory\nor technological\xe2\x80\x94affect the airlines, and how airlines, in turn, react and affect the ATS and its stakeholders.\nAirline-EVOS employs an agent-based approach to simulating airline behaviors, ideal for the complex system\ninteractions in the ATS. The agent-based approach naturally accommodates modeling the multiple independent,\nheterogeneous entities, or agents, within the ATS that interact in specific ways. Agents follow predefined and often\nsimplified rules that are designed to emulate real-world counterparts (airlines, passengers, air traffic control,\nairports). By representing simple behaviors at the agent-level, emergent dynamics can be observed from a system\nperspective as the agents interact with each other. Key behaviors that airlines are expected to exhibit in response to\npolicy changes and new technologies were identified. At a high level, only two primary behavior responses are\ndirectly available to the airlines: airfare pricing strategies and schedule-based strategies. Accounting for this, airline\nagents are adaptive, making tactical and strategic changes to their airfares and schedules under the influence of\nreinforcement learning, to best enable themselves to generate profit and compete in markets. Passenger agents\nchoose to purchase their most preferred ticket based on their objectives and mission, subject to some randomness,\nused to model non-utility maximizing behaviors and irrationality.\n\nFigure 1: Overview Context Diagram of Airline-EVOS\nFigure 1 illustrates, at a high-level, how Airline-EVOS operates, using data inputs for airlines and passengers to\nexecute a looping process within the model. This iterative process models airlines selling tickets and responding to\nboth the market and competition, adjusting airfares or flight schedules to maximize profits. Iteration loops create\nlearning opportunities; the airline agents determine the success of implemented strategies and, on the basis of their\n2\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nassessment, continue or end the strategy and try new ones. The outputs from Airline-EVOS are adjusted flight\nschedules, which are used for assessing airline-specific operational performance as well as ATS-wide performance,\nand airline-specific financial metrics, which are used for assessing airfares, market trends, and airline financial\nperformance.\n\nIII. Data Used\nA. Transportation System Analysis Model (TSAM): TSAM is a nationwide transportation planning model to\nforecast intercity travel behavior in the United States. The model uses socio-economic and demographic data to\nmake projections of future travel demand for trips by available modes; these are travel by air, road and rail 2. TSAM\nis used for current and future schedule data (2012 and 2030), as well as O-D market specific average airfare and\ndemand. TSAM provides the airfare and demand data as annual aggregate values, which had to be converted to daily\nlevel data.\nB. DB1B (Airline Origin and Destination Survey Data) and Form 41 Financial Data (Air Carrier Financial\nReports): DB1B is a 10% sample of airline tickets from reporting carriers collected by the Office of Airline\nInformation of the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS)3. Data includes origin, destination and other itinerary\ndetails of passengers transported. We use DB1B data to get the (P0,D0) point for each O-D market specific airfare\ndata. The \xf0\x9d\x91\x830\xf0\x9d\x90\xb70 point for every market is defined as the number of customers willing to pay at least the 75th\npercentile of airfare. For this task, the transactions that are non-CONUS and/or have airfares less than $30 or greater\nthan $10,000 are removed. These criteria filtered 289,961 of 5,477,362 entries in the original DB1B file used, or\napproximately 5 percent of all entries.\nForm 41 data contains financial information on large certified U.S. air carriers4. This financial information\nincludes balance sheet, cash flow, income statement, operating costs etc. We use this data to obtain airline specific\nfinancial information to distinguish and account for the unique nature\nC. IATA report (Price Coefficient of Elasticity): The amount that the individual customers will pay can be\ndetermined given the market\xe2\x80\x99s price elasticity curve, derived from own-price elasticity-of-demand estimations based\non market haul-length and customer type (business or leisure). Table 1 shows the values of price elasticity of\ndemand (\xce\xb1), which are as specified in the report prepared for International Air Transport Association (IATA) by\nInterVISTAS on estimating air travel demand elasticities5.\n\nTable 1 Own-Price Elasticities of Demand (Source: IATA Report3)\n\nUsing airfare and air-carrier cost data from BTS and price elasticities from Table 1 above, multiple instantiations\nof demand curves are generated. These demand curves are created for each O-D market and travel type (business or\nleisure) at the beginning of a model run. A sample demand curve for JFK-LAX market and business passengers is\nshown in Figure 2.\n\n3\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nFigure 2 Market Demand Curve for JFK-LAX Using Market Elasticity Assumptions for Business\nLong-Haul Markets\nThis demand curve is a graphical representation of the number of potential customers that may buy tickets, as\nwell as the amount each customer is willing to pay for a single ticket. A point (x,y) on the curve implies that there\nare exactly \xe2\x80\x9cx\xe2\x80\x9d customers who are willing to buy the tickets if it is priced at \xe2\x80\x9c$y\xe2\x80\x9d.\nThe demand curve is generated using P0D0 values obtained from DB1B and the price coefficient of elasticities\nobtained from IATA report. Thereafter the following equation was used to iteratively generate the demand curve:\n1/\xef\x81\xa1\n\n\xef\x83\xa6D\xef\x83\xb6\nP\xef\x80\xbd\xef\x83\xa7 \xef\x83\xb7\n\xef\x83\xa7D \xef\x83\xb7\n\xef\x83\xa8 0\xef\x83\xb8\n\n*P0 ,\n\n(1)\n\nP is the willingness to pay at demand D. P 0 and D0 have been defined earlier in the DB1B data explanation. The\nvalue of D is incremented from 0 to Dmax in steps of one. Dmax is arbitrarily chosen to be 1.25 times the TSAM\naverage daily demand for the O-D market under consideration. Consumers are instantiated 25% in excess of target\nTSAM demand to ensure there are enough customer agents in the ABM ecosystem to satisfy the demand.\nCalibration Objectives and Challenges\nThe main goal of calibration is to generate representative market-specific demand curves, although it also\ninitializes the model with more representative starting airfares. This process entails shifting the demand curve higher\nor lower to capture desired demand at the desired average airfare.\nOne of the major challenges in designing a one-size-fits-all calibration algorithm for all the O-D markets is the\ninterdependence of the airfare and demands for many O-D markets in the ATS. For a given airline, it is possible that\nmultiple O-D markets that share flight legs exist. For example: JFK-ORD-DTW and JFK-ORD-IAD share the JFKORD leg. For such market pairs, demand on the common flight leg for one market would influence the remaining\nsupply (and hence airfare and demand) for the other market.\nAnother challenge in designing a calibration algorithm that also tries to calibrate average airfare for each market\nis the variation of ticket prices for a given market. This variation in airfares for a given market follows real world\nscenarios where a particular itinerary for a given O-D market is priced based on number of connections, departure\ntime, and travel duration among other factors. Also, for a given itinerary, the airfares are modified based on dynamic\n4\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nload factors and advanced purchase time. To account for all these variations in the airfares, Airline-EVOS models\nairfares (A) for a given O-D market (m) through baseprice (B) and multipliers ( \xef\x81\xac , F and G) as shown in the\nfollowing equation.\ni\ni\n\nl\nAm,d \xef\x80\xbd \xef\x81\xaci * Bm * F (l i ) *G(d i )\n\n--(2)\n\nl ,d\nm\n\nA is the airfare for an itinerary \xe2\x80\x98i\xe2\x80\x99 of market \xe2\x80\x98m\xe2\x80\x99 when the load factor on itinerary \xe2\x80\x98i\xe2\x80\x99 is l i, and di is the days-\n\nto-travel for itinerary i. F is a function that determines based on the input load factor, the airfare multiplier 6.\nSimilarly, G is a function that determines based on the days-to-travel, the airfare multiplier6. \xef\x81\xaci is a non-stop\nmultiplier that is 1.5 if itinerary i is non-stop and 1 otherwise.\nDuring calibration, B is the only parameter that can be adjusted to influence airfare. The dynamic multipliers\nrelated to load factor and advance purchase time makes it particularly challenging to alter basefare such that the\naverage of resulting airfares is within tolerance of the TSAM target airfare.\nCalibration is successful when the total number of customers that travel in Airline-EVOS matches\xe2\x80\x94within some\naccuracy threshold\xe2\x80\x94the number of customers that travel in TSAM, for each market, and simultaneously, the\naverage price of the two models are within some accuracy threshold.In Airline-EVOS, during the customer ticket\npurchasing phase, customers purchase tickets in a sequential order based on their advance purchase date. As each\ncustomer buys a ticket, airlines change their ticket prices. For the most part, the more tickets sold, the higher the\nprice becomes since price increases with load factor. There can be exceptions to this rule since price also changes\nwith advanced purchase time. Regardless, price is unpredictable and changes with the number of passengers.\nTherefore, it is impossible to simply modify customer WTP values until the traveler counts match between the two\nmodels. Instead, to calibrate the Airline-EVOS demand model to TSAM, it is necessary to employ a search\nalgorithm that will increase and decrease both base price and customer WTP values until the values for average\nprice and number of trips match between TSAM and Airline-EVOS.\n\nIV. Method\nThe search algorithm proposed in this paper adjusts, for each market, the base market airfare and the customer\nWTP, in order to match the simulated Airline-EVOS demand to match the market-specific TSAM average demand\nat the TSAM average airfare.\nThe following is the description of the method:\nFrom the 54,550 distinct origin-destination (O-D) markets modeled in TSAM, a market was filtered out if that\nparticular market satisfied any one of the following conditions:\ni. Has no available itinerary option (as per input schedule derived from TSAM),\nii. Has an average airfare less than $30, or\niii. Has a daily demand projection of fewer than 20 passengers.\nFor each market remaining in the input data (4,688), it is considered to be calibrated if the average AirlineEVOS demand at the TSAM average airfare is within 30 percent of the TSAM target. The markets in the ATS are\nhighly heterogeneous, both in terms of airfare and demand. The high variability in the range of these target values\nmakes it challenging to design a one-size-fits-all calibration algorithm solution. This challenge is exacerbated by the\nfact that this is a network problem where these markets are not disjoint, and the behavior of one market influences\nother connected markets. Considering all these factors, the calibration tolerance limit for both the market demand\nand the airfare was agreed up with NASA as 30 percent; a market was considered successfully calibrated if its\ndemand and airfare were within 70 percent to 130 percent of the TSAM target value.\nThe calibration algorithm approach used two phases to address the two challenges described earlier. The first\nphase was for initial calibration of Airline-EVOS to within the accuracy tolerance of the TSAM target. The second\nphase was an evolution phase in which airlines used TSAM calibrated parameters for market demand curve\nassumptions and was then allowed to conduct some number of learning iterations to evolve their own airline-specific\nbase prices. That approach enabled each airline to have its own valuation of a given market, which accounted for\nfactors such as operating costs, market share, and fuel costs. This was necessary to allow differentiation between\nairlines.\nThis two-phased approach yielded a TSAM calibrated result that (1) captured a representative sample of market\ndemand dynamics, while (2) also accounting for airline-specific pricing behaviors within that market.\nA. Phase 1 Initial Calibration to TSAM\n5\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nThe purpose of this phase is for the calibration algorithm to determine some market-specific customer WTP and\nbase market price\xe2\x80\x94for all airlines\xe2\x80\x94that results in an Airline-EVOS average market demand that closely resembles\nthe TSAM average market demand at the TSAM average airfare. It ensures a better initial condition, moving\nAirline-EVOS parameters closer to the TSAM target values, and thereby helps the overall calibration algorithm to\nconverge more quickly. Our search algorithm for Phase 1 is presented in the following pseudo-code:\n1. For each selected market, initialize\na. base fare to 50 percent of the target TSAM average airfare for that market, and\nb. demand curve such that exactly 120 percent of TSAM demand passengers\xe2\x80\x99 WTP is less than or\nequal to the base fare.\n2. Initiate the ticket purchasing component of the simulation to compare Airline-EVOS simulated results\nagainst the TSAM target values for each market.\n3. Terminate the calibration loop if either of the following is true:\na. Calibration iteration reaches the user-specified maximum number of iterations. After 6-9\niterations, diminishing returns were observed, where each iteration executes in about 3 minutes.\nb. Calibration results are within the accuracy target of 30 percent of TSAM target values.\n4. For each market that is not calibrated, with respect to demand and/or air-fare, do the following:\na. If demand is not calibrated:\ni. If demand > TSAM demand, then decrease WTP.\nii. Otherwise, increase WTP.\nb. Else (implies that only airfare is not calibrated):\ni. If average airfare > TSAM airfare, decrease base airfare.\nii. Otherwise, increase base airfare.\n5. Go to Step 3 and continue calibration.\nB. Phase 2 Evolution of Airfares\nThe search algorithm used in Phase 1 modified a market-specific base airfare used by all airlines operating in\nthat market. The resulting Airline-EVOS outcomes from this phase did not preserve those agent characteristics that\ndistinguished the airlines from each other. Therefore, a secondary calibration step was initiated to allow airlines to\nevolve their market-specific base fares (keeping the calibrated WTP values static) that accounts for their own costs,\nrevenues, and competitive position. This phase is based on a learning algorithm that seeks to improve the airline\xe2\x80\x99s\nitinerary-based profits in that market.\nGiven outputs from the first calibration phase, airlines are now allowed to evolve only the base airfares, keeping\nthe market-specific demand curves (WTP) intact. The following pseudo-code describes our second phase:\n1. Initiate the ticket purchasing component of the simulation to compare Airline-EVOS simulated results\nagainst the TSAM target values for each candidate market identified in Phase 1 of the calibration.\n2. Terminate the calibration loop if learning iteration number is equal to the user-specified maximum number of\niterations, currently set at 10, else go to Step 3.\n3. Instruct all airline agents to calculate profits on an itinerary basis for each market.\n4. For each airline in a candidate market:\na. If the itinerary-based profits have improved from the previous state, increase the learning factor\nmultiplier and apply it to the base fare, increasing the airfare.\nb. Otherwise, decrease the learning factor multiplier.\nGo to Step 1 and continue process.\n\nV. Results\nThis calibration algorithm was applied and tested on 2012 and 2030 flight schedules.\nA. Current Schedule (2012) Calibration Results\nPhase 1 resulted in the calibration of 3,084 of the 4,688 candidate markets.after six iterations. Another three\nlearning iterations increased the total to 4,309 of the 4,688 candidate markets, which represents about 74.3 percent\nof total TSAM passenger demand. We regarded this is as sufficient for the initial starting parameters and\nrepresentation of market dynamics to begin the experiments.\nFigure 3 shows the results over the nine iterations we used for calibration. The top plot shows the calibration to\nTSAM average demand, and the bottom plot shows the calibration to TSAM average airfare. The y-axis measures\ncalibration error in both plots and reflects the difference between simulated Airline-EVOS results and the TSAM\n6\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\ntarget values, divided by the TSAM target. We take the absolute value of this ratio, because our results may be on\neither side of the TSAM target. The smaller this ratio, the more the simulated results match TSAM. We consider a\nmarket as calibrated when the ratio for measures of both demand and airfare is less than or equal to 0.30. As typical\nof box plots, the horizontal red line in the box represents the median, but we have also overlaid an open circle to\nrepresent the mean. Table 2 shows the total number of markets calibrated at the end of each iteration.\n\n30% Target\n\n30% Target\n\nFigure 3 Airline-EVOS Calibration Error Results for 2012 Schedule\nTable 2: Airline-EVOS Markets Calibrated Results for 2012 Schedule\nInitial Calibration Phase\n\nCalibration Phase\nIteration\nMarkets calibrated\n\nMarket Learning Phase\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n594\n\n1,030\n\n1,210\n\n2,412\n\n3,084\n\n3,084\n\n4,265\n\n4,309\n\n4,309\n\nThe results shown in Table 2 indicate that after iteration 5, the number of markets calibrated plateaus at 3,084\nmarkets.

Future Schedule (2030) Calibration Results\nFor the future schedule, a total of 4,905 candidate markets were identified. Phase 1 resulted in the calibration of\n3,091 of those markets after six iterations. Another three learning iterations in-creased the total to 4,476 of the 4,905\ncandidate markets, which represents about 76.2 percent of total TSAM passenger demand. This was considered\nsufficient to initialize the starting parameters and represent market dynamics to begin the experiments.\nFigure 4 shows the results over the nine iterations we used for calibration. The top plot shows the calibration to\nTSAM average demand, and the bottom plot shows the calibration to TSAM average airfare. The y-axis measures\ncalibration error in the same way as in Figure 3.

Conclusions\nThe search based calibration algorithm demonstrated in this paper has several implications. The main outcome of\ncalibration was to adjust the market-specific demand curves so that the average number of passengers for the given\nmarket was within an acceptable tolerance limit of the TSAM-specified demand for that market at a particular\naverage airfare. This calibration ultimately enables:\n(i) Synchoronization of the input flight schedule with demand, and\n(ii) Leveraging of TSAM scenarios that model future demand, schedule, and fleet evolution.\nThe demand curves are sorted by WTP values for each market; individual points on the curve represent potential\nbuyers. By calibrating WTP, we are essentially creating a pool of customers with static WTP values. Each customer\nis an independent agent in the system, and the customer\xe2\x80\x99s decision on whether to buy an airline ticket is driven by\n(1) a personal utility assessment for price and inconvenience, and (2) the availability of an affordable airfare.\nEven though TSAM was used for target demand and airfare values, the proposed algorithm is applicable to\ncalibrating any low-level model of the ATS to some other demand forecast model-based data. Ultimately, it must be\nstressed that a calibration algorithm such as the one we present here to synchronize ATS models with specialized\nforecast demand models, is a powerful tool for establishing credible baseline conditions in experiments analyzing\nthe effects of proposed policy changes to the ATS.\n\n8\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nAcknowledgments\nThis work was accomplished under NASA research announcement (NRA) NNH10ZEA001N, \xe2\x80\x9cResearch\nOpportunities In Aeronautics\xe2\x80\x932010\xe2\x80\x9d, Amendment 6, NextGen\xe2\x80\x94Systems Analysis Integration And Evaluation\nProjected C.3 Subtopic 2: Comprehensive Modeling Of Air Carrier Behavior.
