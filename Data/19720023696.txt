Paul McClain, NOAA)\n\nSUMMARY\nPreviously available satellite pictures from ITOS and Nimbus have been\nuseful for ice surveillance, but their relatively coarse ground resolution\nlimited their detection capabilities to only the major ice boundaries\nand the largest ice features.\n\nThe ERTS imagery is clearly the best\n\nsequential, synoptic data on ice ever taken by means of remote sensing\nfor purposes of ice dynamics studies such as those being conducted as part\nof the AIDJEX project.\n\nIt is of the highest importance for these investi-\n\ngations that ERTS coverage of the western Beaufort Sea area be maint=ained\nas long as illumination conditions are adequate.\n\nFour of six IRLS trans-\n\nmitters emplaced in the ice are still functioning.\nFigs. 1 and 2 (MSS 4 and 7) illustrate a variety of ice conditions in\nthe vicinity of Cornwall Island (78N, 95W) on 27 August 1972.\n\nFig. 3 (MSS-\n\n7) shows the same area a few days earlier (23 August), and the significant\nchanges in some areas are readily apparent.\n\nSurface air temperatures at\n\nResolute (75N, 95W) were near or slightly below freezing at local noon\nduring this period.\n\nThe Canadian Ice Central reported total ice concen-\n\ntrations varying from open pack (6/10) to consolidated pack (10/10).\n\nMuici-\n\nyear and second-year ice each ranged from 1/10 to 4/10, with first-year\nice varying from 2/10-4/10.\n\nSome puddles, 6/10 frozen, were reported.\n\nFigs. 4 and 5 (MSS 5 and 7) illustrate rather different ice concitioc-\n\nReproduced by\n\n(E72-10055) ANALYSIS OF ARCTIC ICE\n\'FEATURES W.I.
