The centerpiece of the Earth System Science initiative will be a set of instruments carried on polar orbiting platforms under the Earth Observing System program. An Earth Explorer program can open new vistas in the earth sciences, encourage innovation, and solve critical scientific problems. Specific missions must be rigorously shaped by the demands and opportunities of high quality science and must complement the Earth Observing System and the Mission to Planet Earth. The committee believes that the proposed Earth Explorer program provides a substantial opportunity for progress in the earth sciences, both through independent missions and through missions designed to complement the large scale platforms and international research programs that represent important national commitments. The strategy presented is intended to help ensure the success of the Earth Explorer program as a vital stimulant to the study of the planet.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19900002768, "id": "71f7065c4470448fac263a1e760b5301", "publicationDate": "1988-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19900002768.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19900002768/downloads/19900002768.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19900002768/downloads/19900002768.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19900002768/downloads/19900002768.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
