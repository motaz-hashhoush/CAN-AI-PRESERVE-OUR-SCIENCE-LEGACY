MacLean \xe2\x80\xa1 ,\nCUBRC, Buffalo, New York\nCharles Campbell \xc2\xa7 ,\nNASA Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nAbstract\n\nIn an experimental study to obtain detailed heating data over the Space Shuttle Orbiter, CUBRC has\ncompleted an extensive matrix of experiments using three distinct models and two unique hypervelocity wind\ntunnel facilities. This detailed data will be employed to assess heating augmentation due to boundary layer\ntransition on the Orbiter wing leading edge and wind side acreage with comparisons to computational\nmethods and flight data obtained during the Orbiter Entry Boundary Layer Flight Experiment 1 and\nHYTHIRM2 during STS-119 reentry. These comparisons will facilitate critical updates to be made to the\nengineering tools employed to make assessments about natural and tripped boundary layer transition during\nOrbiter reentry. To achieve the goals of this study data was obtained over a range of Mach numbers from 10\nto 18, with flight scaled Reynolds numbers and model attitudes representing key points on the Orbiter\nreentry trajectory. The first of these studies were performed as an integral part of Return to Flight activities\nfollowing the accident that occurred during the reentry of the Space Shuttle Columbia (STS-107) in February\nof 20033. This accident was caused by debris, which originated from the foam covering the external tank\nbipod fitting ramps, striking and damaging critical wing leading edge heating tiles that reside in the Orbiter\nbow shock/wing interaction region. During investigation of the accident aeroheating team members\ndiscovered that only a limited amount of experimental wing leading edge data existed in this critical peak\nheating area and a need arose to acquire a detailed dataset of heating in this region. This new dataset was\nacquired in three phases consisting of a risk mitigation phase employing a 1.8% scale Orbiter model with\nspecial temperature sensitive paint covering the wing leading edge, a 0.9% scale Orbiter model with high\nresolution thin-film instrumentation in the span direction, and the primary 1.8% scale Orbiter model with\ndetailed thin-film resolution in both the span and chord direction in the area of peak heating. Additional\nobjectives of this first study included: obtaining natural or tripped turbulent wing leading edge heating levels,\nassessing the effectiveness of protuberances and cavities placed at specified locations on the orbiter over a\nrange of Mach numbers and Reynolds numbers to evaluate and compare to existing engineering and\ncomputational tools, obtaining cavity floor heating to aid in the verification of cavity heating correlations,\nacquiring control surface deflection heating data on both the main body flap and elevons, and obtain high\nspeed schlieren videos of the interaction of the orbiter nose bow shock with the wing leading edge. To\nsupport these objectives, the stainless steel 1.8% scale orbiter model in addition to the sensors on the wing\nleading edge was instrumented down the windward centerline, over the wing acreage on the port side, and\npainted with temperature sensitive paint on the starboard side wing acreage. In all, the stainless steel 1.8%\nscale Orbiter model was instrumented with over three-hundred highly sensitive thin-film heating sensors,\ntwo-hundred of which were located in the wing leading edge shock interaction region. Further experimental\nstudies will also be performed following the successful acquisition of flight data during the Orbiter Entry\nBoundary Layer Flight Experiment and HYTHIRM on STS-119 at specific data points simulating flight\nconditions and geometries. Additional instrumentation and a protuberance matching the layout present\nduring the STS-119 boundary layer transition flight experiment were added with testing performed at Mach\nResearch Scientist, AAEC, CUBRC, 4455 Genesee Street, Buffalo, NY, Senior Member.\nVice President, Hypersonics, AAEC, CUBRC, 4455 Genesee Street, Buffalo, NY, Fellow.\n\xe2\x80\xa1 Senior Research Scientist, AAEC, CUBRC, 4455 Genesee Street, Buffalo, NY, Senior Member.\n\xc2\xa7 Aerospace Engineer, NASA Johnson Space Center, 2101 NASA Parkway, Houston, TX, Senior Member.\n*\n\xe2\x80\xa0\n\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\n48th AIAA Aerospace Sciences Meeting and Exhibit \t\n4 - 7 January 2010, Orlando, Florida\n\nAIAA 2010-1576\n\nnumber and Reynolds number conditions simulating conditions experienced in flight. In addition to the\nexperimental studies, CUBRC also performed a large amount of CFD analysis to confirm and validate not\nonly the tunnel freestream conditions, but also 3D flows over the orbiter acreage, wing leading edge, and\ncontrol surfaces to assess data quality, shock interaction locations, and control surface separation regions.\nThis analysis is a standard part of any experimental program at CUBRC, and this information was of key\nimportance for post-test data quality analysis and understanding particular phenomena seen in the data. All\nwork during this effort was sponsored and paid for by the NASA Space Shuttle Program Office at the\nJohnson Space Center in Houston, Texas.\n\nI. Introduction and Program Overview\nThe primary purpose of this test program (designated M11-13) was to perform tests at Mach Numbers of 10,\n14, 16, and 18, with matched flight Reynolds Numbers at model scale to obtain detailed laminar and turbulent heat\ntransfer measurements on the wing leading edge of the Space Shuttle Orbiter in the peak heating shock interaction\nregion. These measurements would be used for CFD code validation and to update the engineering tools that are\nused to predict pre-flight reentry heat loads to the Orbiter. Other objectives included obtaining centerline and\nattachment line transition data at high Mach numbers; and acquiring model attitude and control surface deflection\ndata over a range of Mach numbers and Reynolds numbers\nAcquiring this data became a priority for NASA following the Colombia tragedy, and in light of the limited\namount of experimental wing leading edge heating data that was available to evaluate damage that might occur\nduring ascent on Shuttle flight. Prior to Colombia there were only a limited number of experimental wind tunnel\nOrbiter heating tests that had been conducted to collect wing leading edge data. Of this group, only one test was\nconsidered accurate enough with a high enough resolution of heat transfer sensors to be considered the as reference\nfor wing leading edge heating. That model, designated O11-66, contained only one detailed chord-wise heating strip\nin the peak heating shock interaction region and fixed the span-wise peak heating to this location. The limited\namount of data also posed a risk to the program described here in this report; even with a large amount of\ninstrumentation it may still be possible to miss the wing leading edge peak heating location. As an added difficulty,\nthe three-dimensional geometry and shock wave boundary layer interaction made prediction of the peak heating in\nthese types of flowfields by the most accomplished computationalists using today\xe2\x80\x99s state-of-the-art codes difficult at\nbest.\nThe Orbiter Entry Aeroheating technical leadership, endorsed by the Space Shuttle Orbiter Project, chose\nCUBRC\xe2\x80\x99s LENS I Hypervelocity Shock Tunnel Facility to meet these goals because of the facility\xe2\x80\x99s ability to match\nthe required reentry trajectory test conditions and because of CUBRC\xe2\x80\x99s ability to instrument the Orbiter wing\nleading edge with a large amount of highly accurate thin-film sensors. The LENS I facility was also ideal due to the\ndelicate nature of the thin-film sensors and the necessity to obtain data over the series of Mach Numbers, Reynolds\nNumbers and model attitudes with little loss to the valuable sensors.\nA separate but equally important part of the test is CUBRC\xe2\x80\x99s CFD analysis that has been done to validate\nand verify every aspect of the test from confirming tunnel calibration results and aiding in the design of tunnel\nhardware to the pretest predictions of the model flow fields and heating level estimates. CFD calculations before\nany testing is done and throughout the entire testing process have become an integral part of any test program\ncompleted at CUBRC. This work will be discussed in more detail later in this document.\nAdditional studies will be completed in the near future with the M11- 13 model to compare to experimental\ndata obtained during reentry of STS-119. The model will be modified with additional instrumentation to match\nthose present during the reentry flight along with replication of a boundary layer trip placed on the model to induce\nboundary layer transition on the windside wing acreage of the Orbiter. This experimental data and the\ncorresponding computational results will go a long way to further the understanding of the differences of boundary\nlayer transition in experimental facilities, computational codes, and flight.\n\n2\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\n\t\n\nII.

LENS Facility Altitude Velocity Map\n\nB.\t\n\nFigure 5. Mach Number/Reynolds Number Envelope\n\nHeat Transfer Instrumentation\n\nFor these studies we employed thin-film heat transfer instrumentation\nsimilar to those designed at Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory (CAL) in the late\n1950s and refined over the past 50 years. The platinum thin-film heat transfer\ninstrumentation employed in these studies have proven to be the most accurate\nmeasurement technique in supersonic and hypersonic test facilities, and the\nsmall size of the sensing element coupled with the insulating substrate make\nthem ideal for a high resolution measurements CUBRC has calculated the\naccuracy of the heat transfer measurement to be \xc2\xb15%. \t\nFigure 6b. 0.125\xe2\x80\x9d Thin-film\nThe thin-film heat Heat Transfer Instrument\ntransfer gauge is a resistance\nthermometer that measures the\nlocal surface temperature of the\nmodel. The theory of heat\nconduction is used to relate the\nsurface temperature history to the\nrate of heat transfer. Since the\nFigure 6b. 0.050\xe2\x80\x9d Thin-film\nplatinum resistance element has\nHeat Transfer Instrument\nnegligible heat capacity, and\nFigure 7. MH-13 Port Side Wing Leading hence negligible effect on the Pyrex surface temperature, the gauge can\nbe characterized as being homogeneous and isotropic with properties\nEdge Thin-film Pyrex Inserts\ncorresponding to those of the Pyrex (Videl 1956 and Cook and\nFelderman 1966). Furthermore, because of the short duration of shock\ntunnel tests, the Pyrex can be treated as a semi-infinite body. The same\nis true for Macor, which was also employed in this test to allow for the\ninstrumentation of the starboard wing leading edge. While this\napplication was ideal for Macor due to the ease at which it can be\nshaped, Pyrex was used everywhere else due to its superior durability.\nExamples of the types of thin-film instrumentation employed in this\ntest can be seen in Figures 6-8. Unique to this test are the leading edge\nPyrex inserts and the Macor leading edge insert shown in figures 7 and\nFigure 8. Macor Insert in Starboard\n8 respectively. The Pyrex inserts were cut and shaped as a single piece\nWing Leading Edge\nof glass to match each wing span location and then had the platinum\n4\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nsensor painted at the desired location in the chord wise direction. The sensors were tightly packed in the peak\nheating region and spread out on both the windward and leeward sides. In all more that 200 platinum thin-film\nsensors were present in these inserts. The Macor leading edge on the starboard side of the model contained 30 thinfilm sensors that represented twice the density in the peak heating region in the span-wise direction compared to the\nPyrex based inserts on the port side of the model.\nPressure Instrumentation\nFor these studies, we primarily employed piezoelectric pressure gauge instrumentation that, like the\nplatinum thin-film sensor, was originally designed at Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory. These gauges employ a\ndiaphragm design and read the model pressure versus a pretest baseline pressure (differential pressure). In the data\nreduction process this baseline, or pre-run pressure, is subtracted off the final measurement to yield an absolute\nmeasurement. Additionally, these transducers are mounted close to the surface of the test article so that orifice\neffects and fill times are negligible. The piezoelectric pressure transducers, manufactured by PCB, are capable of\naccurately measuring pressures within \xc2\xb13%. Figure 7 shows a typical PCB piezoelectric pressure transducer.\nWhere size constraints do not allow for PCB style instrumentation CUBRC employs both Endevco and\nKulite piezoresistive type transducers. These transducers have a very small sensing footprint and can be installed in\ndifficult geometry locations. These sensors also typically have a higher frequency response (~100 kHz) than the\nstandard piezoelectric sensors we employ. The piezoresistive strain gauge-type transducer also has an accuracy of\n\xc2\xb13%. Figure 8 shows a typical Kulite style transducer.\nPressure gauges employed by CUBRC are calibrated installed in the test article whenever possible.\nCalibration is carried out by subjecting each gauge to a traceable, steady pressure pulse lasting tens of milliseconds\nto duplicate what the gauge will experience during testing. This will occur over the range of expected pressures that\nthe gauges will experience during testing.\n\nC.\t\n\nFigure 9. Typical PCB Piezoelectric\n\t\nPressure Transducer\n\n\t\n\nFigure 10.

Model Design and Construction\nA. 1.8% Scale Risk Mitigation Phase Orbiter Models\nCUBRC designed, constructed and instrumented the 1.8% scale steel and aluminum MH-13 model using\nconfiguration and outer mold line data supplied by the NASA team. CUBRC contracted EverFab, a local highfidelity fabrication shop, to build this model due to the high OML tolerances that could be maintained and inspected.\nThe first model constructed was made from RenBaord, an inexpensive epoxy-based material used for quick\nprototyping. Fabrication of the RenBoard model was done to ensure the files provided by NASA were of machine\nfabrication quality, and that EverFab would be able to construct the Orbiter to NASA\xe2\x80\x99s tolerances and\nspecifications. This verification and acceptance of the Renboard model primarily meant that the file CUBRC was\ndesigning from itself was considered to be of \xe2\x80\x9dmachine quality\xe2\x80\x9d, meaning that the file did not have gaps or\nunconnected surfaces that the machining software had to interpret in order to construct the model. The primary\nconcerns for model construction and data analysis were surface smoothness, dimensional and geometric variances,\nas well as being able to ascertain model coordinates via the temperature sensitive paint video imaging system. In\naddition, a critical design aspect was to provide a means of rigidly placing fiducial points along the model at known\nlocations by taking measurements of the placed points with respect to the model geometry. After the drawing file\nwas checked for machine fabrication quality, design of the peripheral hardware needed for testing the model in\nLENS I was completed. The sting assembly used in this series of tests is shown in Figure 11. The sting assembly\nwas fabricated such that multiple angles of attack could be achieved with minimal time to adjust the model and\nassembly to the desired pitch angle. In addition, a small yaw-plate was constructed to be inserted between the model\n\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\n\t\n\nand sting assembly for test conditions that required a yaw angle. Due to the uncertainties of the different model\nattitudes to be studied, the yaw-plate and sting assembly were designed to be readily modified with minimum time\nfor machining and/or assembly. In order to accurately measure the pitch and yaw of the model\xe2\x80\x99s orientation, a\npitch/yaw measuring plate was fabricated in which the plate, bushings and\nmounted holes were machined with respect to the model centerlines. The\n~\nvariance due to machining of the measured pitch/yaw angles was calculated\n[uig?Dd\'a^mt:\t\nto be \xc2\xb1 5 minutes. A drawing of the pitch/yaw measuring plate is shown in\nFigure 12. Finally, prior to testing, all of the model components were\n-^ *\t\nstressed to four times the highest load the model would be subject to in the\ntest matrix. This included the model, yaw plates, and sting hardware.\n*\t\n4\t\nThe primary challenge of the detailed design of the model was in\nmaking it versatile enough to incorporate the large amount of\ninstrumentation, be able to accept the various cavity and trip blocks and\nrings, have the required movable control surfaces, and still pass the loads\nFigure 11. MH-13 Sting Assembly requirements of testing in the LENS I facility. The steel fuselage\ncomponent remained one solid piece that attached to the sting assembly and carried the loads of the attached wing\nand centerline components. The forward (X/L=0.3) trip and cavity block as well as the aft (X/L=0.5) trip and cavity\nring can be seen as well as the port thin-film inserts. These inserts were each made from a single piece of Pyrex that\nwas individually cut and shaped to exactly match the wing outer mold\nline at a particular span station. Each Pyrex insert had fourteen platinum\nthin-film instruments painted on them and were set with epoxy into the\t\n,.\n-; ter,_\nappropriate wing leading edge slot (Figure 13). Allowances were also\t\n^5a\nmade along the centerline, wing acreage, and control surfaces for an \t\nadditional 100 sensors to measure centerline and attachment line heating r T\nchanges resulting from model attitude changes and boundary layer\ntransition. This capability was augmented with adding a uniform depth \t\nN\n; ,_,__,.^\ncavity machined into the starboard wing acreage to accept temperature \t\nsensitive paint insulator and sensing coats while still matching the\nrequired outer mold line geometry. The temperature sensitive paint will Figure 12. Pitch/Yaw Plate for Use\nlook at the global effects of transition while the more accurate thin-films with CUBRC Inclinometer\nwill look at the temporal effects.\nBetween the first and second entries of the model modifications were made to accept a trip ring at X/L=0.3,\ninstead of just a centerline block, and additional instrumentation was added to fulfill newly expanded testing goals.\nThis included the addition of a Macor wing leading edge insert on the starboard side of the model (Figure 8) that\nfeatured double the number of span-wise thin-film\nsensors in the wing leading edge peak heation region\nwhen compared to the port side. The new instruments\n,r- - _\t\nwould further map out the peak heating locations and\n\'1\n-\t\n-- \xe2\x80\x94\t\nserve as a check of the data from the port side of the\n! ,\t\nmodel.\t\nAdditional trips and cavities were also\n-\',`\t\n`- \xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\t\n_\t\n^._ "\t\n-_\nj\n- \'\xe2\x80\xa2\nmanufactured to assist in the acquisition of a larger\ndataset of high Mach number boundary layer transition\ndata on the centerline and wing acreage.\n_\t\nrid\t\nr\t\nA third entry is currently planned for the early\n. \xe2\x80\xa2,\n2010 with the addition of 20 thin-film sensors matching\nlocations on the STS-119 Flight Boundary Layer\nTransition Experiment. Additional trip elements will\nFigure 13. MH-13 Wing Leading Edge Thin-film also be constructed to simulate the boundary layer trip\npresent on the flight.\nPyrex Inserts\t\n\nIV. Experimental and Computational Facility Flow Calibrations\nEach unique test condition to be run during the experimental program is first calibrated with test runs in the\nfacility and is also predicted computationally. These computational predictions allow for having to make fewer\ntunnel calibration runs at each condition and more importantly, it adds greatly to the understanding of what is\n6\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\noccurring in the freestream at every condition. This\nPlrotn..\n.\nbecomes important later when full 3D model\t\n^ _^eres=,Nn,ferm,ry\numder\ncomputations are preformed. \t\nBasic instrumentation\t\nassociated with the experimental calibration of the LENS\n"\xe2\x80\x94\'^`^\xe2\x80\x94 } \xc2\xb0 c^\nfacilities include: pressure sensors to monitor the initial \t\ndriver and driven gas pressures and temperatures, thinfilm resistance gauges installed at fixed locations on the\ndriven tube to monitor incident shock wave speed as it\npropagates down the tube, pressure sensors in the endwall \t\nCa id t en Rak\t\na and s a P ess\xc2\xb0re\nregion to measure the reflected shock reservoir pressure, \t\nr\nStagna Heat Transter\na pressure sensor in the initially evacuated test section,\t\n__\t\nHeat Transfer\t\t\nand a survey rake installed in the test section to measure \t\nthe\n.__\t\n\xe2\x80\x9e.\nvalldat,adrTeat\npitot pressure, static pressure and stagnation point heat \t\no Information\ntransfer in the freestream.

Comparison between Experimental\na hemispherical nosetip.\t\nand Computational Nozzle Pitot Pressure Profile\nThe first step in determining the test conditions\nin LENS facility is to determine the conditions observed in the reservoir. This is accomplished via a combination of\nmeasurement and theory. The initial and final (reservoir) pressures are measured by a group of redundant pressure\ngauges in the endwall of the driven tube. The shock speed is also measured by a series of fast-response gauges\ndown the length of the driven tube which react as the incident shock moves through the test gas. Employing this\ninformation, the unique reservoir conditions may be computed from generalized equilibrium conditions and wave\npropagation theory after both the incident and the reflected shocks have passed through the test gas. The\ncomputation of the reservoir assumes full thermodynamic and chemical equilibrium at all points. This is a safe\nassumption, as the pressures and temperatures after the shocks are very large, thus making relaxation times\nexceptionally short. Relevant translational, rotational, and vibrational modes are considered in the energy of the\nmolecules.\nThe results were then compared with the pre-calibration computational results. Figure 15 shows an example\nof the comparison of the Navier-Stokes and the measured pitot profile measurements for Mach numbers of 10, 14,\nand 16, demonstrating the level of agreement obtained between CFD and experiment in the LENS programs. Pitot\npressure is used as a measure of freestream accuracy for two primary reasons: (1) it is a directly measurable\nquantity, and (2) it is sensitive to the momentum in the flowfield; hence, it is a good choice to judge the accuracy of\nthe freestream specification. The computations were preformed with the DPLR Navier-Stokes solver [Wright, et al.\n1998] that had been modified specifically to solve the nozzle flow problem in the LENS facility. As stated earlier in\nthis section, the excellent results obtained from these computations allow for fewer facility calibration runs and give\nCUBRC and the customer a greater understanding of the freestream conditions in the facility. This process of\nperforming both experimental and computational has become the standard procedure CUBRC employs to prepare\nfor any experimental program in the LENS facility.\nMach N\n\ng\nvaadate Start Pressure\n\nArse my\t\n\ntion\n-Ch ck Total Temperature\n\nNozzle\n-Confi rm and Select\t\nComputational\t\nModels used to\n\nConditions and Pmvidd\nAdditi nal\n\xc2\xb0n Flow Cha , r\t\na\n\nLENS I Call cratlon Rake Installation Drawing\n\n7\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nV. The Experimental Studies\nA. Pre-Test and MH-12 Risk Mitigation Phase\nThe experimental program began with an extensive literature search for data to aid in the placement of the\nwing leading edge instruments in order to capture the peak heating locations over a range of Mach numbers,\nReynolds numbers, and model attitudes. The peak heating is fundamentally due to the shock boundary layer\ninteraction of the bow shock from the nose of the Orbiter impinging on the wing leading edge. A typical Schlieren\nimage of this shock wave can be seen in Figure 16. Available literature included data from the OH-66 Shuttle\nOrbiter wing leading edge test performed at Calspan (the\npredecessor of CUBRC) in 1978 [Wittliff, et al. 1978]. While\nseveral aerothermal tests were conducted to obtain wing\nleading edge heating data, the OH-66 test remained the only\ndetailed wing leading edge aerothermal test to be conducted on\nthe Shuttle Orbiter until the current test described in this\nreport. The data from OH-66 became the basis, along with key\nflight data calibrations, for the engineering tool that is still\nused today to predict mission heating loads. Several photos of\nthis test model can be seen in Figure 17. The model was a\n2.5% scale replica of the existing outer mold lines that\nFigure 16. Typical Schlieren Image of Shock contained four densely populated thin-film sensor strips at 40,\nInteraction Due to Bow Shock from Orbiter 55, 80, and 90 percent of semi-span. Of these four insert\nlocations only the 55 percent position was placed in the shock\ninteraction peak heating region. Also questions existed as to\nwhat the outer mold lines of the model actually looked like\nwhen compared to current Orbiter CAD files because the\nmodel has been destroyed since the end of the test program. In\nthe end it was determined that the OH-66 data, with additions\nfrom current computational predictions ,was not enough to\nconfidently place the large number of sensors necessary to\nmap out the interaction peak heating region within the required\ntime or resources available for the test.\nTo mitigate the risk to the program, CUBRC\nsuggested performing a preliminary set of tests on the model\ngeometry with temperature sensitive paint to map out the peak\nFigure 17. OH-66 Aerothermal Model\t\nheating region. This risk mitigation phase, designated MH-12,\nwas broken up into three distinct parts. The first part consisted of a limited number of facility calibrations to check\nflow uniformity, core size, and test time to allow CUBRC to size and locate the model and to start the temperature\nsensitive paint checkout process. These calibrations confirmed that the proposed 1.8% scale Orbiter model would\nbe well inside the uniform core flow of LENS I over the vast majority of required test conditions. The first Orbiter\nmodel to be tested was a plastic RenBoard model that served as the machining test model for Everfab, the\n\nFigure 18.

The twelve runs\ncompleted in this series were made solely to confirm\nthe experimental setup and techniques necessary to film\nthe wing leading peak heating locations with\ntemperature sensitive paint durring the time that the\nfollow-on aluminum model was being manufactured by\nEverfab. Fourteen test runs were completed with the\naluminum model, shown in Figure 22, employing\nFigure 20.

This\ntemperature sensitive paint data was backed up on the\nother side of the model with thin-film instrumentation painted onto a Macor insert which can be partially seen at the\nbottom of the model in Figure 22.. An example of the temperature sensitive paint data collected can be seen in\nFigure 20 [Smolinski. The acquired temperature sensitive paint and high speed schlieren information were directly\nused along with the limited OH-66 and computational results to specify where the wing leading edge\ninstrumentation should be placed. Detailed information concerning the temperature sensitive paint technique can be\nfound in the references. [Hubner, et al. 2002].\nC. The Main MH-13 Shuttle Orbiter Test Program\nThe main part of this program followed the risk mitigation phase after the design, manufacture,\ninstrumentation, and assembly of the new steel and aluminum MH-13 model was completed. This new model was\ninitially instrumented with 288 sensors, over 200 of which were on the wing leading edge, and the rest (over 80 in\nnumber) were located on the body centerline, wing acreage, and control surfaces. These acreage sensors were added\nto meet secondary objectives of centerline and attachment line boundary layer transition, centerline and acreage\nangle of attack and yaw data, and control surface deflection data. The starboard side of the model was also setup to\nutilize temperature sensitive paint to get global images of the transition process. Photographs of this model,\ninstrumentation, and temperature sensitive paint regions can be seen in Figures 21-23.\nLike the risk mitigation phase of the program, the main part was also broken to several distinct phases, the\nfirst of which consisted of a new series of calibration runs representing Mach number and Reynolds number sweeps\nalong the nominal flight reentry trajectory including prescribed trajectory excursions limits. Mach Numbers of 10,\n14, 16, and 18 were surveyed with sample calibration data shown in Section IV. After completion of the calibration\ntests the steel and aluminum MH-13 model was installed in LENS I and tested to meet the primary objective of\nmapping wing leading edge laminar and turbulent heating over a reentry range of Mach numbers, Reynolds\nnumbers, and model attitudes. Determination of the turbulent heating increment above the laminar value on the\nwing leading edge was of key importance to bound the :\n\nFigure 21. MH-13 Aerothermal Model Installed in Figure 22. Wing Leading Edge Thin-film Inserts\nLENS I\n9\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\n\t\n\ninteraction region. Beyond wing leading edge heating\ndata, secondary goals included centerline and\nattachment line boundary layer transition studies and\nacquiring acreage and control surface data at various\nmodel and control surface attitudes. An example of\nsmooth wall, no trips or cavities, boundary layer\n( transition is shown in Figure 24.

The date is from the sensors along the\nr\ncenterlone of the Orbiter from the nose to the end of the\nbody flap as shown in Figure 23. The body flap in this\nFigure 23.

To obtain this data CUBRC manufactured, and in some cases instrumented, a series of\nprotuberances and cavities prescribed by LaRC to achieve incipient transition. The protuberances included both\ndiamond trips and wedge like fences that represented protruding gap fillers in flight. Cavities varies from long and\nshallow, to short and deep, to sloping bottoms reminiscent of real cavities documented during flight. An example\nof the protuberances and cavities used in this phase are shown in Figures 25 and 26. The incipient transition point\nAnn\n\nFigure 25. Photograph of a Typical Protuberance Figure 26.

Boundary Layer Transition Behavior Observed During MH-13 Studies\nTemperature sensitive paint images were also taken during this phase to access the global effects of\ntransition on the wing acreage. The temperature paint section of the model can be seen in yellow in Figure 23.\nThese images were taken to observe the extent and locations of the turbulent wedges as they occur on both smooth\nbody runs and tripped runs. An example of a typical temperature sensitive paint image can be seen in Figure 28. In\nthe figure laminar regions are colored blue with turbulent data showing up in green to yellow on the wing acreage.\nThe wedge of turbulent flow from the centerline of the model, toward the top of the figure, and from the attachment\nline, toward the bottom of the figure, can be seen.\nBetween the first and second entry of this phase of the program the model was reconfigured for additional\nwing leading edge sensors and new protuberances and cavities were built. The model was modified with a new\nwing leading edge insert (Figure 8) made of Macor and instrumented with 20 thin-film sensors placed directly on the\nsurface and new locations for trips and cavities to be installed. Researchers wanted this additional wing leading\n11\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nFigure 28. False Color Temperature Sensitive Figure 29. Diamond Trips Applied Directly to\nPaint Results Showing Regions of Laminar and Wing Leading Edge\nTurbulent Heating\nedge instrumentation set to obtain wing leading edge heating data on the starboard side of the model, mirroring the\noriginal thin-film wing leading edge inserts on the port side, to check the data from the first entry and to achieve\ndouble the resolution in the peak heating shock interaction region in the span-wise direction. The second entry\nbegan with several new facility calibration runs to cover new boundary transition conditions and to confirm existing\nconditions. During this second entry the primary objective was the confirmation of turbulent heating increments\nabove the laminar values in the peak interaction region. The data was acquired with smooth body, attachment line\ntrips on the body, and a set of trips that was even applied directly to the wing leading edge. Examples of these wing\nleading edge trips can be seen in Figure 29. The turbulent wing leading edge data was checked against smooth and\ntripped data from the firstentry, the new starboard side mirror gauges, and versus smooth body and tripped data with\ntrips placed at several different locations on the body to confirm the turbulent heating increment using the Stanton\nnumber correlation method mentioned in the pervious phase. A secondary objective that encompassed a majority of\ntest runs in this phase focused on acquiring boundary layer transition data with a new set of protuberances and\ncavities that in some cases resembled geometries that could be present in flight. As before, the incipient transition\npoint was determined with a Reynolds number survey. Temperature sensitive paint data was again taken to observe\nthe global transition behavior along the centerline and attachment line wing acreage locations as shown in Figure 31.\nD. Future Studies with the MH-13 Model to Match Flight Results\nIn the spring of 2010 a new entry has been planned with a further modified MH-13 model. This new entry\nwill acquire experimental data to compare to data taken during the reentry flight of STS-119 (Campbell Referecne\nXXXX). This Orbiter mission included a number of TPS tiles on the wing acreage that were replaced with tiles\ncontaining thermo-couple sensors to measure the surface heating as the Orbiter passed through the atmosphere.\nThese sensors were placed on the wing to observe the state of the boundary layer behind a protuberance that was\nlikewise placed in the center of a new surface tile. The layout of these sensors and the location of the protuberance\nduring flight can be seen in Figure 30 with the proposed layout on the MH-13 model shown in Figure 31. The\nCUBRC experiments will duplicate these locations and employ a boundary layer scaled protuberance simulating the\nflight article. The model will also include a scale protuberance on the temperature sensitive paint side of the model\nto observe the extent of the turbulent wedge produced by the protuberance. This data could additionally be\ncompared to infrared measurements of the windside of the Orbiter as part of the HYTHIRM program. Freestream\nconditions for these studies will be selected to match Mach number and the model scaled Reynolds number of key\npoints of interest for boundary layer transition. This experiment will represent another important opportunity to\nassess differences in the character of boundary layer transition between prediction, ground testing, and flight results\nto build toward improved methodologies for the prediction of boundary layer transition on future high speed flight\nvehicles. CUBRC is also working toward having this key comparison between flight, ground testing, and\ncomputational results on several other programs including HIFiRE \xe2\x80\x93 1 and -5, X-51, and X-43 which were all tested\nfull-scale at conditions duplicating those found in flight(Ref XX).\n\n12\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nFigure 25. Shematic of Flight Instrumentation\nOn STS-119 Boundary Layer Flight Experiment\n\nFigure 26. Matching Instrumentation Locations\non MH-13 Experimental Model\n\nE. CUBRC Computational Support of MH-13 Experimental studies\nAs mentioned earlier, in parallel with the experimental studies in this program CUBRC performed an\nextensive amount of computational studies. These studies included computations of the facility nozzle flow and\nfreestream conditions and 3D results of the mean flow over the Orbiter model. The primary CFD tool used is the\nDPLR code provided by NASA Ames Research Center. DPLR is a multi-block, structured, finite-volume code that\nsolves the reacting Navier-Stokes equations including finite rate chemistry and finite rate vibrational nonequilibrium effects. This code is based on the data-parallel line relaxation method [Wright 1998] and implements a\nmodified (low dissipation) Steger-Warming flux splitting approach [MacCormack 1989] for the convection terms\nand central differencing for the diffusion terms. Finite rate vibrational relaxation is modeled via a simple harmonic\noscillator vibrational degree of freedom [Candler 1995] using the Landau-Teller model [Landau 1936] Vibrational\nenergy relaxation rates are computed by default from the semi-empirical expression due to Millikan and White\n[Millikan 1963], but rates from the work of Camac [Camac 1964] and Park, et al [Park 1994] are substituted for\nspecific collisions where experimental data exists. Vibration-dissociation coupling is currently modeled using the TTv approach of Park [Park 1987] or with some preliminary implementation of CVDV coupling [Marrone 1963].\nTransport properties are appropriately modeled in DPLR for high enthalpy flow [Palmer 2003, Palmer 2003] using\nthe binary collision-integral based mixing rules from Gupta, et al [Gupta 1990]. Diffusion coefficients are modeled\nusing the self-consistent effective binary diffusion (SCEBD) method [Ramshaw 1990]. Turbulence models available\nin the DPLR code currently include the Baldwin-Lomax 0-equation model [Baldwin 1978], the Spalart-Allmaras\nmodel 1-equation model [Spalart 1992], and the Shear Stress Transport (SST) 2-equation model [Menter 1994] each\nwith corrections for compressibility effects [Brown 2002, Catris 1998]. Recent relevant capabilities of the DPLR\ncode involve automated grid adaptation to improve solution quality [Saunders 2007]. The code employed to check\nthe facility nozzle flows is also a version of the DPLR code that has been hardwired for the flows in the CUBRC\nexperimental facilities.\nExamples of this work can be seen in Figure 24 showing results for the Orbiter centerline. Data in this\nfigure has again been non-dimensionalized by a Fay-Riddel reference value to collapse the laminar heating data\nalong the centerline. Computational results in Figure 24 show excellent agreement with the laminar heating down\nthe centerline of the model and into the separation/interaction region of the deflected body flap. A departure from\nthe laminar solution on the body flap has been attributed to boundary layer transition. Similar computational studies\nwere also done on the wing leading edge of the model with grid cells placed specifically over locations of the span\nand chord \xe2\x80\x93wise locations of the thin-film sensors. These solutions also showed good laminar collapse when\ncompared with data upstream, inside of, and downstream of the shock interaction region.\n\n13\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nVI. Summary and Conclusions\nExperimental Orbiter aerothermal testing has been conducted in the CUBRC LENS I hypervelocity shock\ntunnel to acquire detailed wing leading shock interaction laminar and, where possible, turbulent heating data at\nMach numbers between 10 and 18 at reentry trajectory Reynolds numbers. These experiments were conducted in\norder to obtain a high resolution data set that could accurately map out the extent of peak heating due to the Orbiter\nbow shock interaction on the wing leading edge for variations in Mach number, Reynolds number, model attitude,\nand the addition of protuberances. Additionally, centerline and wing acreage laminar and turbulent heating data\nwere also obtained at various model attitudes for smooth body, protuberance tripped, and cavity tripped flows. This\ndata will aid in the validation of engineering tools that predict the effectiveness of trips and cavities in transitioning\nthe boundary layer during Orbiter reentry. To achieve these goals CUBRC constructed three 1.8% scale Orbiter\nmodels from detailed CAD files obtained from NASA. The first two models were tested with temperature sensitive\npaint and a limited amount of thin-film heat transfer sensors to mitigate the risk of sensor placement on the main\nwing leading edge model. The results obtained from the risk mitigation model tests, the 0.9% LaRC model, and\navailable computational solutions allowed team members to confidently place sensors on the main 1.8% scale model\nto access the extent of the peak heating region on the wing leading edge. The highly accurate, high resolution data\ncollected in this test will be used by NASA and their contractors to validate and calibrate the computational codes\nand engineering tools that are in place to access the Orbiter heating environment during reentry.\nAdditional new experiments have been planned to match boundary layer transition data acquired in flight\nduring reentry of the Orbiter. This data will be employed, along with other experimental and computational results,\nwith existing and future flight experiments to improve the prediction methodologies for boundary layer transition in\nflight.\n\nVII.
