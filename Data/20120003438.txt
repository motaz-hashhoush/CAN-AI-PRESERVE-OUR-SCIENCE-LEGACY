b'I am an engineer in the Thermal Protections Systems group and I would like to talk to the\nmedia about the parts shown on the next page and how I work with them on a daily basis\nin my group. My presentation is not going to be very technical or identify\nmaterials/composition of the parts. I would like to use the sample TPS parts as visual\naids.\nSpecifically, I will be stating the following:\nWhen showing the HRSI tile, I would like to show the tile that is found on the lower\nsurface of the orbiter and talk about the heating the HRSI tiles can take.\nWhen showing the Ames gap filler, I would like to show that we install some gap fillers\nin between the tiles to prevent heating to the structure.\nWhen showing the sample blanket, I would like to state the temperatures that the upper\nsurface blankets can take.\nWhen showing the waterproofing samples, I would like to demonstrate how one sample\ncan absorb all the water when not waterproofed and show how the other sample does not\nabsorb the water, but instead beads up on the surface. I will briefly talk about\nwaterproofing and why we need it (e.g. rain out at the pad)\n\nREPORT DOCUMENTATION PAGE\n\n0MB No. 0704-0188\n\nThe public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimated to average 1 hour per response, including the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources.\ngathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information.

The space capsules were\nprotected during re-entry by shedding layers of a heavy,\nresinous heat shield through a process called ablation.\nThe spacecraft were not reusable.\nFor the Space Shuttle orbiter, a different kind of heat\nprotection system was needed. With a design life of\nabout 100 missions, this revolutionary new space\nvehicle required a lightweight, reusable Thermal\nProtection System composed of entirely new materials.\n\nJ\t\n\nNASA selected four basic materials for the original\ndesign used on Columbia, the first operational orbiter.\nEach was designed to insulate the orbiter\'s aluminum\n\'\t\nand/or graphite epoxy skin against a wide range of\n-\t\nextreme temperatures, including a low of minus 250\ndegrees F. The basic materials were Reinforced Carbon-Carbon, Low- and High-Temperature\nReusable Surface Insulation tiles, and Felt Reusable Surface Insulation blankets.\nSubsequent design improvements included use of advanced materials in certain areas. These\nmaterials are Flexible Insulation Blankets and Fibrous Refractory Composite Insulation.\nThere are approximately 24,300 tiles and 2,300 Flexible Insulation Blankets on the outside of each\norbiter.\nThe orbiter\'s nose cone, including the chin panel, and the leading edge of its wings are the hottest\nareas during re-entry. When maximum heating occurs about 20 minutes before touchdown,\ntemperatures on these surfaces reach as high as 3,000 degrees F.\n\nhttp ://www-pao.ksc.nasa. gov/kscpao/nasafactltps.htm \t\n\n10/19/2007\n\nJohn F. Kennedy Space Center - Orbiter Thermal Protection System \t\n\nPage 2 of 4\n\nReinforced Carbon-Carbon (RCC) is a light gray, all-carbon composite. RCC, along with inconel foil\n(metal) insulators and quartz blankets, protect the orbiter\'s nose, chin, and wing leading edges from\nthe highest expected temperatures and aerodynamic forces. It also is used in the arrowhead area at\nthe forward section of the orbiter where the external tank is attached. RCC is used there for shock\nprotection during pyrotechnic separation of the external tank from the orbiter.\nFabrication of RCC begins with graphite cloth which is saturated with a special resin. Layers of the\ncloth are then laminated and cured, after which they are heat-treated to convert the resin into carbon.\nAfter further processing, the material is treated with a mixture of alumina, silicon and silicon carbide to\ngive it a grayish, oxidation-resistant coating, and then heated in a furnace. The orbiter\'s nose cap is\nfabricated as one piece while each of the wings has 22 seperate RCC panels and T- seals on the\nleading edge. Each panel is affixed to the orbiter\'s skin by mechanical attachments.\nAbout 70 percent of an orbiter\'s external surface is shielded from heat by a network of more than\n24,000 tiles formed from a silica fiber compound. More advanced materials such as Flexible\nInsulation Blankets have replaced tiles on some of the upper surfaces of the orbiter.\nCoated black tiles-known as High-Temperature Reusable Surface Insulation (HRSI)-cover the lower\nsurface of the orbiter, areas around the forward windows, upper body flap, the base heat shield, the\n"eyeballs" on the front of the Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS) pods, and the leading and trailing\nedges of the vertical stabilizer and the rudder speed brake. The black tiles are located where\ntemperatures can reach as high as 2,300 degrees F.\nCoated white tiles-known as Low-Temperature Reusable Surface Insulation (LRSI)-are designed to\ninsulate the spacecraft from temperatures up to 1,200 degrees F. LRSI tiles were originally used\nextensively, but are now replaced in most areas by Flexible Insulation Blankets. LRSI is still used on\nthe upper surface of the forward fuselage above the crew windows and on some parts of the OMS\npods.\nTiles vary in size, thickness and density. HRSI tiles are generally 6 inches square; thickness varies\nfrom 1 to 5 inches. They come in different densities: 9- and 22-pound- per-cubic-foot tiles. LRSI tiles\nare larger and thinner, generally 8 inches square and from 0.2 to 1 inch thick. LRSI tiles come in 9and 12-pound-per-cubic-foot densities.\nThe thermal properties of the tiles are dependent on their very high purity. The manufacture of both\ntypes of tiles begins with fibers of pure white silica refined from common sand. The fibers are mixed\nwith deionized water and other chemicals and poured into a plastic mold where excess liquid is\nsqueezed out of the mixture.\nThe damp blocks are dried in the nation\'s largest microwave oven at the Sunnyvale, Calif., plant of\nLockheed Space Operations Co. Then, they are sintered in a 2,350 degrees F oven. Sintering fuses\nthe fibers without melting them.\nRough cutting and precision sizing of the tiles are done with saws. Final shaping of the surface is\naccomplished with 3- and 5-axis numerically controlled milling machines using diamond-tipped\ncutters. The tiles are then spray-coated, glazed and waterproofed. The processing and inspection of\neach tile is documented, and individual tiles are traceable back to the orginal sand lots. No two tiles\non an orbiter are exactly alike. The curvature of each tile\'s underside is matched to the contour of the\nShuttle\'s skin at the exact point the tile is to be bonded.\nThe two types of tiles are the same except for their coating, which is primarily borosilicate glass.\nChemicals are added to the coating to give the tiles different colors and heat rejection capabilities.\nSurface heat dissipates so quickly that a tile can be held by its corners with a bare hand only seconds\n\nhttp ://www-pao.ksc.nasa.gov/kscpao/nasafact/tps.htm \t\n\n10/19/2007\n\nJohn F. Kennedy Space Center - Orbiter Thermal Protection System \t\n\nPage 3 of 4\n\nafter removal from a 2,300 degrees F oven, while the center of the tile still glows red with heat.\nImprovements to the Thermal Protection System have reduced the amount of maintenance required\nafter each mission. In many cases, scratches and gouges on the tiles can be repaired. A new\nassembly and manufacturing facility for thermal protection materials opened in 1988 at Kennedy\nSpace Center. Two other tile assembly and manufacturing facilities are at Lockheed\'s Sunnyvale\nplant, and at Rockwell International\'s Palmdale, Calif., plant.\nThe tiles are delicate and have to be protected from the stresses on the orbiter\'s structure during\nflight. Launch blasts, aerodynamic pressures, steering forces, vibration and acceleration cause the\nvehicle body to bend and shift slightly during launch. In the cold soak of space, the vehicle shrinks\nslightly, only to expand again during re-entry.\nTo prevent damage to the tiles, Strain Isolation Pads - a layer of nylon felt Nomex (flame-retardant\nmaterial)- are used between the tiles and the orbiter\'s surface. The pads are bonded to the tiles, as\nwell as to the skin of the Shuttle, with RN, a room-temperature vulcanizing silicone adhesive. The tile\nsurface bonded to the pads is densified with silica-type solutions for added tensile strength.\nAnother type of protective blanket material is Felt Reusable Surface Insulation (FRSI) blankets. These\nblankets protect the orbiter surfaces from temperatures between 350 degrees and 700 degrees F.\nThe insulation is coated with a white silicone rubber paint. FRSI once covered about 25 percent of the\nvehicle. Now, the material is used only on the upper section of the payload bay doors and the inboard\nsections of the wing upper surface.\nMost of the LRSI tiles and FRSI blankets have been replaced by Flexible Insulation Blankets (FIBs),\ncomposed of a waterproofed, quilted fabric with silica felt between two layers of glass cloth sewn\ntogether with silica thread. The average FIB weighs 4.9 kilograms or 11 pounds per cubic foot.\nThe blankets have better durability, and cost less to make and install than the tiles. They are used on\nthe upper sidewalls of the orbiter\'s fuselage, sections of the payload bay doors, most of the vertical\nstabilizer and rudder speed brake areas, the outboard and aft sections of the upper wing, parts of the\nelevons, and around the observation windows.\nSome of the HRSI tiles have been replaced by Fibrous Refractory Composite Insulation (FRCI-12),\nwhich are less dense than the 22-pound-per-cubic- foot HRSI tiles but comparable in strength. They\nare used around penetrations and leading edge areas.\nOther thermal materials used are the filler bar and gap fillers which seal gaps between tiles and\nbetween the tiles and the orbiter structure. The seals protect the aluminum and/or graphite epoxy skin\nof the orbiter by preventing the influx of hot plasma gas. The gap fillers are envelopes of ceramic fiber\ncloth stuffed with a resilient ceramic filler batt, and sometimes with a metal foil. The filler bar consists\nof strips of Nomex felt coated with RN, and is part of the assembly method used for tiles.\nA combination of white and black pigmented silica cloth make up thermal barriers, and are installed\naround penetrable areas such as main and nose landing gear doors, the orbiter\'s side hatch, umbilical\ndoors, elevons, forward Reaction Control System module and thrusters, OMS pods, and gaps\nbetween tiles in high differential pressure areas.\nFused silica is used for the outer windows in the orbiter. Metal is used for the forward reaction control\nsystem fairings and elevon seal panels on the upper wing elevon interface.\nAll of the major ingredients in the Shuttle\'s external Thermal Protection System-tiles, Flexible\nInsulation Blankets and Felt Reusable Surface Insulation-are bonded to the orbiter with the RN\nadhesive. The cement will withstand temperatures as high as 550 degrees F, and as low as minus\n250 degrees F without losing its bond strength.\n\nhttp://www-pao.ksc.nasa.gov/kscpao/nasafactltps.htm\t\n\n10/19/2007\n\nPage 4 of 4\n\nJohn F. Kennedy Space Center - Orbiter Thermal Protection System \t\n\nAfter each flight, the orbiter\'s external Thermal Protection System is rewaterproofed.\nDimethylethoxysilane is injected into the tiles through an existing hole in the surface coating with a\nneedleless gun, and the blankets are injected by a needle gun. The procedure must be done each\ntime because the waterproofing material burns out at 1,100 degrees F., thus exposing the outer\nsurface of the thermal system to water absorption.\nThere are numerous and far-ranging possibilities for spinoffs or commercial applications of Thermal\nProtection System materials. For example, tiles can be ideal as a jeweler\'s soldering base because\nthey absorb so little heat from a torch, do not contaminate precious metals and are soft enough to\nhold items to be soldered. Because of their purity, tiles can be an excellent high-temperature filter for\nliquid metals. Carbon-carbon pistons have been shown to be lighter than aluminum pistons and\nincrease the mechanical and thermal efficiencies of internal combustion engines.\nHigh costs at this time are a deterrent to widespread application of the techniques and materials of\nthe Thermal Protection System. A single coated tile can cost as much as $2,000. But technological\nadvances may make these pure, lightweight thermal materials the new insulators of the future.\nTop of Page\r\nKSC Home Page Site Search FAQs Site Survey customer Forum - NASA Centers \t\n\nPrivacy Statement Headlines\n\nPage Last Revised\n\nPage & Curator Information\t\n\nI\n\n08/28/2000\n\nCurator: Kay Grinter (kay.grinter-1ksc.nasa.gov ) / InDyne, Inc.\t\nWeb Development: JBOSC Web Development Team\t\nA Service of the NASAIKSC External Relations and Business Development Directorate\nJoAnn H.
