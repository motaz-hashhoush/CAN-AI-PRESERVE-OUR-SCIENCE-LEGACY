Some options are examined for adapting existing Secure Telephone Unit III (STU-III) secure telephone equipment for use over a digital mobile satellite link, as well as for the evolution of a dedicated secure voice mobile earth terminal (MET). The work has included some lab and field testing of prototype equipment. The work is part of an ongoing study at JPL for the National Communications System (NCS) on the use of mobile satellites for emergency communications. The purpose of the overall task is to identify and enable the technologies which will allow the NCS to use mobile satellite services for its National Security Emergency Preparedness (NSEP) communications needs. Various other government agencies will also contribute to a mobile satellite user base, and for some of these, secure communications will be an essential feature.", "title": "Secure voice for mobile satellite applications", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T17:24:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19920014947, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Vaisnys, Arvydas"}, "organization": {"name": "Jet Propulsion Lab., California Inst. of Tech.", "location": "Pasadena, CA, United States"}}, "id": "2650bb0690744a8580080b071e9d4f7e"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19920014947, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Berner, Jeff"}, "organization": {"name": "Jet Propulsion Lab., California Inst. of Tech.", "location": "Pasadena, CA, United States"}}, "id": "ffd37cb3fb3d46c6bd65c34bb74f917d"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19920014947, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19920014947, "id": "f123b6ebbf1b4fac9c528e226dc2b2d5", "publicationName": "Proceedings of the 2nd International Mobile Satellite Conference (IMSC 1990)", "publicationDate": "1990-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19920014947.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19920014947/downloads/19920014947.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19920014947/downloads/19920014947.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19920014947/downloads/19920014947.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
