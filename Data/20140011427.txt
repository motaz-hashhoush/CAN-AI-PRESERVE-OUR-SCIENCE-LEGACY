Under Congressional\nBudget Office (CBO) scoring of the House CR, a non-defense\nsequester would not occur (but a defense one would). Last year,\nOMB was estimating a sequester level of at least 7.0% below FY13\nappropriated (non-sequestered) levels, but several technical factors\nhave occurred to reduce the required cut.\n\xef\x82\x97 Bottom line: Since there is uncertainty about final non-defense\nappropriation levels, there is still uncertainty about whether a\nsequester would be required.\n\nWhat can be done?\nThe answers are nearly always\nidentical: The government must\naddress all spending and tax\ncategories, NOW.\n\n14\n\n15\n\nFactoids\n16\n\n\xef\x82\x97 2009 was the last time Congress passed a budget\n\n\xef\x82\x97\n\xef\x82\x97\n\xef\x82\x97\n\n\xef\x82\x97\n\nresolution\n2010 Republicans won the house majority, creating a\ndivided Congress\nCurrent budget panel is the 5th bipartisan attempt in 3\nyears to address the nation\xe2\x80\x99s debt and deficit\nGoal \xe2\x80\x93 find a way to ease the impending budget cuts\nwithout adding to the deficit\n2nd installment of sequestration reductions is a drop from\n$986 billion in 2013 to $967 billion in 2014\n\nObstacles\n17\n\n\xef\x82\x97 Democrats want to end some corporate tax breaks\n\xef\x82\x97 Republicans oppose any changes to the tax code outside a\n\xef\x82\x97\n\n\xef\x82\x97\n\xef\x82\x97\n\xef\x82\x97\n\nbroader deal\nRepublicans want to cut spending on entitlement\nprograms\nDemocrats oppose entitlement cuts without revenue\nconcessions\nLast-minute pressure to renew expanded federal\nunemployment benefits\nLabor unions opposed to proposed cuts in federal\nemployees\xe2\x80\x99 pensions\n\nCrafting a budget plan\n18\n\n\xef\x82\x97 FY 2014 Continuing Resolution (P.L. 113-46) extends\n\n\xef\x82\x97\n\n\xef\x82\x97\n\n\xef\x82\x97\n\xef\x82\x97\n\nthrough January 15, 2014\nCBO reported that the U.S. Treasury Department may be\nin a position to hold off the need for new borrowing\nauthority until June 2014\nFY 2014 Budget Conference is optimistic about the\npossibility of reaching a deal within the December 13,\n2013 deadline\nReal deadline is January 15th when government funding\nruns out\nWould another CR obtain the necessary votes?\n\nSearch for Common Ground\n19\n\n1.\n2.\n\n3.\n4.\n5.\n\n6.\n7.\n8.\n\n9.\n\nMedicaid\nMedicare\nOther health programs\nFederal retirement plans\nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac\nRetirement insurance premiums\nAgriculture subsidies\nRadio spectrum\nSupplemental Nutrition Assistance Program\n\nProposal\n20\n\nReplace or scale back a portion of the FY 2014 automatic\nsequester cuts\n2.
