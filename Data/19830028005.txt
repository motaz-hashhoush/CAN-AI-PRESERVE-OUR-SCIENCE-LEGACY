An awareness of the physical properties of the\ncryogenic fluids being dealt with is important in directing attention to hazardous\nsituations which may arise. Because of this, the more important properties of the\ncryogenic fluids are given, such as molecular weight, boiling point and freezing\npoint. From these properties, hazardous situations can be deduced. There are hidden\ndangers that are not always easy to spot. Some of the unexpected hazards, most of\n\'which have led to deaths, are: asphyxiation (anoxia), frost bites and hypothermia,\nexplosions, and combustion. The aim of this publication is to help bring about\nincreased safety in the production and use of cryogenic products through a deeper\nappreciation of the scientific, technological and administrative steps which must be\nmade if accidents, some fatal, are to be avoided in the future.\n\n17.

Safety in existing cryogenic processes\nis of course equally important.\nFortunately the Cryogenics Industry, largely because it was\nconceived and developed by scientists and engineers, has\na good safety record but, due to the complexity of the\ntechnology it employs, the wide variety of fields it\nembraces and the ever increasing involvement of the public\nas product usage expands, accidents, many of which could\nhave been avoided, are still occurring. The dissemination\nof safety information on Cryogenics in a readily digestible\nform is therefore vital at this point in time.\nIn the UK the British Cryogenics Council set up a panel of\nexperts having considerable scientific and practical\nexperience to examine cryogenic safety in a fully comprehensive way. The findings of this group have been published\nas a revision of the Cryogenics Safety Manual which was\npublished by the BCC over 10 years ago and was felt to need\nupdating. It is hoped that this book which covers:\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n\nGeneral Safety Pequirements\nOxygen, Nitrogen and Argon\nLNG, Ethylene and Ethane\nHydrogen\nHelium and Neon\n\nwill lead to a fuller understanding of the problems that\ncan arise in Cryogenics and to better all-round safety in\nthis field.\n\nOF PCCA U\'-.-Ji-. : /\n\n- 2-\n\nOF pecs g-j;.L.n,f\n\nIn the present talk I wish to highlight some general\naspects of Cryogenic Safety and to draw attention to some\nof the more unusual hazard situations which may well be\nnew even to people who have worked in cryogenics for quite\nsome time.\nHAZARD AVOIDANCE - GENERAL\n\nSafety specialists often have a tendency to concentrate\ntheir efforts on particular aspects of safety, whilst\nneglecting the vitally important broader areas which are\na prerequisite of good safety. Briefly, these can be said\nto cover:\n(a)\n\nHardware\n\n- this must be properly designed\nand suitable for its purpose\n\n(b)\n\nMode of Operation - a well designed plant may fail\nif it is not operated properly\n\n(c)\n\nMaintenance\n\n- plants will not remain safe if\nthey are not adequately\nmaintained\n\n(d)\n\nOrganisation\n\n- must be adequate to control (a")\n(b) and (c)\n\nIt is perhaps on (d) that there has been the greatest neglect,\nalthough Managements are becoming increasingly aware of the\nimportance of this area. It is, for instance, pointless to\ndevote time and effort to producing a rule book if there is\nno system for ensuring that the rules are being observed.\nBetter by far to have fewer rules coupled with a mechanism\nto ensure that the rules are adhered to. A rule book filled\nwith outdated and unnecessary rules will not earn the respect\nof workers and can therefore itself be regarded as a hazard.\nManagements tend to devote effort only to the creation of new\nrules, whereas it is equally important from the safety viewpoint to devote effort to the elimination of old outdated\nrules.\nRELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SAFETY AND CRYOGENIC FLUID PROPERTIES\nAn awareness of the physical properties of the cryogenic\nfluids being dealt with is important in directing attention\nto haanrd eituationa which may arise. For this reason the\nflAfoty Manual starts by listing the more important\nproperties such na molecular weiaht, boiling point and\nf+*~*4ut* ^vMia, \'4\'ak.tmj a quick look at some of these, let\nus see some of the things we can deduce.\n\xc2\xab\xc2\xabse, xet\n\n- 3-\n\n(a)\n\nMolecular Weight\nHydrogen\nHelium\nOxygen\nNitrogen\nEthane\nArgon\nKrypton\nXenon\n\nOF POCR CL\'/\n2\n\n4\n32\n28\n30\n40\n84\n131\n\nAir\n\nHydrogen and helium are very light and will clearly\nrise in air at normal temperature.\nThis knowledge, coupled with the fact that hydrogen\nreadily forms explosive mixtures with air, means we\nmust be on the alert for dangerous situations at\nhigh points in buildings in the event of a hydrogen\nleak. Also, it is no good trying to vent the gas\nat low level.\nArgon is unexpectedly heavy and will be difficult to\ndisperse from low lying badly ventilated areas. Its\nremoval from enclosed spaces will be better achieved\nby suction than by blowing.\n\nAIR\n\nSUCTION\n\n(b)\n\nBoiling Points and Freezing Points\n\nOxygen\nNitrogen\nArgon\nHydrogen\nHelium\n\nBoiling Point\n\xc2\xb0\nC\n-183\nAir\n-196\n-186\n-253\n-269\n\nFreezing Point\n-219\n-210\n-189\n-259\n\n- 4The boiling points in this slide show us the order\nof condensation of a number of different cryogenic\nfluids as temperature is reduced.\nAir, which is a mixture of oxygen and nitrogen, will\nclearly condense if exposed to liquid nitrogen, thus\nthe use of inert liquid nitrogen can lead to the\ncreation of a non-inert atmosphere which supports\ncombustion because it contains oxygen. This is why\nwe prefer to use non-combustible insulant in vessels\ncontaining liquid nitrogen.\nDesigners sometimes forget that cryogenic gases can\nfreeze. From the slide it can be seen that the\nboiling points of hydrogen and helium are so low that\nthey will cause all other gases to freeze leading to\npossible plant blockages and in the case of hydrogen\nto the even greater hazard of solid oxygen formation.\nThe fact that the boiling point of argon is separated\nfrom the freezing point by only 3\xc2\xb0C has led to the\ndownfall of many a plant designer.\nThe Boiling Point slide also reminds us that very low\ntemperatures are involved in cryogenic equipment and\nthis dictates the metals of construction we can use.\nEmbrittlement forces us to think in terms of stainless\nsteel, aluminium and bronze. Incidentally, there is\none area where low temperature assists the designer,\nnamely, the increase in tensile strength which it\nproduces. In the case of stainless steel, for instance,\nthe tensile strength is doubled at low temperature\nproviding a useful safety margin over room temperature\npredictions.\nThese very low temperatures are also going to involve\nproblems of contraction of plant and the packing of\ninsulant, if this is in the form of powder, making\nrepeated warm-up for inspection undesirable and even\nhazardous.\nAlso, it should be remembered that a joint which is\nleak-tight at room temperature may well not be leaktight at low temperature.\n(c)\n\n.\nQF POOR Q \'\n\nVolume Ratio Gas/Liquid\nOxygen\nNitrogen\nHelium\nHydrogen\nNeon\n\n843\n683\n740\n833\n1415\n\nOR\'.GSfJAL FA^ "\xc2\xab\n\n- 3-\n\nOF POOR QUALITY\nThe volume ratio gas/liquid on vaporisation of most\ncryogenic fluids lies between 600 and 800. Neon\nis exceptional in having a ratio of 1415.\n(d)\n\nLiquid Density\n\nHydrogen\nHelium\nNitrogen\nOxygen\nXenon\n\nDensity at Normal\nBoiling Point\n(Kg/Cu M)\n71\n125\n808\n1138\n3040\n\nThe considerable density difference between hydrogen/\nhelium and oxygen/nitrogen should warn us not to use\nhydrogen/helium dewars for storing oxygen/nitrogen as\nthe vessels may well be incapable of standing the extra\nweight. The situation is aggravated by the fact that\nhydrogen and helium vessels have to be designed to\ngive maximum protection against heat inleak; consequently\ntheir support systems tend to be relatively fragile.\nFrom the few examples, it can be seen that the worker who\ntakes the trouble to know something of the properties of the\nvarious cryogenic fluids he has to deal with will already\nhave travelled a considerable distance along the road to\nsafety. There are however many hidden dangers which are not\nalways so easy to spot. These are dealt with in considerable\ndetail in the revised Manual and I am certain that few people\nwill read it without learning something new. I would like\nnow to consider some of the unexpected hazards, most of which\nhave led to deaths in the past.\nPHYSIOLOGICAL\n(a)\n\nAsphyxiation (Anoxia)\nThe increased use of inert gas during recent years\n. has unfortunately not been matched by an increased\nawareness of the danger that can arise due to these\ngases being asphyxiants. This has led to many deaths.\nA lack of awareness of this hazard even by people who\nhave enjoyed the highest levels of scientific training\nts confirmed by the deaths which have occurred in the\natomic energy and research fields, and in the chemical\nindustry.\n\n- 6Q^\'o"11 PAGS s\'9\n\nAnoxia is of course lack of oxygen. Many people QUALITY\nhave an erroneous view of the time taken for lack\nof oxygen to have an effect on human beings. This\nis derived largely from films and the like about\nwhat happens in the case of submarine disasters\nwith the victims gasping for breath for long periods.\n\nRising carbon dioxide concentration in a submarine\nmakes the victims breathe harder and this partly\ncompensates for the lack of oxygen. In most industrial\nsituations when oxygen shortage arises there is no\nincrease in carbon dioxide concentration to warn the\nbody to breathe harder and there is no gasping for\nbreath. If oxygen is totally cut off, as could happen\nwhen breathing pure nitrogen or argon (or LNG or\nhydrogen for that natter), the victim goes down without\nwarning as if struck on the head with a hammer and in\na few minutes he will be dead.\nThe next slide which falls into the category of\n\'having a quick look1 shows one manifestation of this\ntype of accident where a man who knew nitrogen to be\nunbreathable decided to have a quick look in a tank\nwhich had been purged with nitrogen. He stuck his\nhead in the tank, took one breath and was later found\ndead with the torch still alight in the bottom of\nthe tank. Incidentally, it was wrongly assumed by\nthe first investigators of this incident that the man\nhad dropped the torch and bent down to get it. It is\nmuch more likeV that he dropped the torch after first\nbecoming unconscious.\n\nOf\n\nAnother slide entitled \'Come up if you are short of\nbreath\' depicts how a worker in the atomic energy\nfield was told by a senior scientist to climb down\ninto a vessel known to contain some argon. The man\nentered and was later found dead.\n\n- 8-\n\nAnother slide shows how the introduction of a hood\nto reduce noise can sometimes lead to a hazardous\natmosphere due to the gradual leakage of inert gas\nfrom a compressor gland.\nACOUSTIC HOOD\n\nLEAK\nNITROGEN\nCOMPRESSOR\n\n1 I\nA particularly insidious aspect of asphyxiation\naccidents is that rescuers can all too easily\nthemselves become victims. What is often forgotten\nis how difficult it is, even with ropes, to extract\nan unconscious man from an enclosed space such as a\ntank. A rescuer finding he cannot pull the man out\nwill often rush in to lift the man out and himself\nbecome a victim.\n\n- 9(b)\n\nFrostbite and Hypothermia\nMany workers know little about frostbite and those\nwho do have some knowledge have usually gained it\nas a result of the bitter experience of having\nbeen frostbitten through contact with cold products\nor metal.\nNaked flesh will of course stick to uninsulated\npipes cooled to very low temperatures. This is a\ntruly terrifying experience. The worst example I\nhave come across is when a small child gained access\nto a vacuum insulated oxygen evaporator (VIE) and\nstuck its tongue on the air heated vaporiser from\nwhich it was licking the snow.\nThe anaesthetising action of cold makes workers\ncareless about getting treatment for frozen limbs\nand the actions to be taken in the event of frostbite\nare points on which people are remarkably illinformed.\nHypothermia is thought by many to be the concern of\nonly the aged. Entry of even a relatively young\nperson into deeply chilled vessels or tanks with\ninadequate clothing can lead to the person losing\nthe strength of his limbs before he becomes aware\nof what is happening. The danger is greatest in\nsummertime when people are wearing light clothing.\n\nIncidentally, if a man is sent to hospital with anoxia,\nfrostbite or hypothermia, it is vital to advise the hospital\nwhat is the matter otherwise valuable time may be lost\ntrying to diagnose the trouble and, likely as not, the\ndiagnosis will be wrong and the victim will be treated for\nsomething he does not have.\nTECHNOLOGICAL\n(a)\n\nNitrogen Explosion Hazards\nAt first sight readers may think this heading is\nincorrect, but this is not so.\nAs we saw earlier on, the condensation of air at\nliquid nitrogen temperature can lead to the formation\nof an oxygen-rich liquid and in contact with\ncombustibles this can result in the formation of\nwhat amounts to an explosive.\n\n- 10 -\n\nPAGE ?s\nOF POOR QUALITY\n\nAnother way in which nitrogen can cause explosions\nis by the deoxidation of lubricants and surfaces\nin compressors handling nitrogen, leading to the\nformation of pyrophoric material. The sudden\nexposure of such machines to air can lead to violent\nexplosions.\n\n(b)\n\nCombustion\nThere is often a lot of confusion over materials\nwhich burn and those which support combustion.\nHydrogen and hydrocarbons burn - oxygen supports\ncombustion.\n\nThe slide shows what happens when an LNG tank leak\ncatches fire. The whole area is engulfed in flame\nand anyone unfortunate enough to be in the spill\narea will be burned. The fireball is likely to\ndamage the tank and this can lead to the further\nescape of product. In other words we can rapidly\nfind ourselves having to deal with a very serious\nsituation.\n\n- 11 OF POOR QUALITY\n\nIn contrast/ consider an oxygen escape. Here one\nman who lights a cigarette goes up in flames, but\nthere is no fire spread, other workers in the area\nare not affected and neither is the tank. We have\na situation which, although very unpleasant for the\nindividual lighting the cigarette, will be most\nunlikely to result in widespread damage.\n*\n\nWhen combustible gases and liquids escape into the\natmosphere they will automatically find oxygen and\nall that is needed for disaster is a trigger. Much\ntime is often wasted after incidents in argument as\nto what this trigger was - spark, friction, static\nelectricity or naked flame. Such arguments, whilst\ninteresting, are not likely to lead to measures\nwhich will prevent such incidents in the future,\nfor in the case of hydrogen or hydrocarbon escape\nit is better to work on the premise that whenever\na spill or an escape occurs a trigger capable of\ncausing ignition is almost certain to arise. This\ngreatly increases the emphasis on spill avoidance\nand leads to improved safety.\n(c)\n\nAnalytical\nCertain combustible gas detectors rely on the presence\nof oxygen in the gas being sampled. If there is no\noxygen present these instruments can give a false\nindication of safety.\nIt should also be remembered that instruments designed\nfor operation at room temperature may not function\nproperly at low temperature.\n\n- 12 (d)\n\nCHJG^\'AL F/U1 "5\n\nOF POOH QUAL.TY\n\nTotal Vaporisation\nIt is often imagined that because a product such\nas liquid oxygen at a particular point in a plant\ncontains a very low concentration of flammable\nimpurity, no danger can arise. Workers forget\nthat if product is totally vaporised certain\nimpurities are liable to be deposited as solid\nwhich, if vaporisation continues, can build up to\ndangerous concentrations. A slide shows how this\ncan arise in the case of the incorrect installation\nof an oxygen withdrawal line from a storage tank.\nA lute should be installed to prevent the vaporisation\nof liquid against the valve which is -warm.\n\n- LIQUID :OXYGEN;\n\n(A)\n\n(e)\n\n;5L1QUIDE>\n\n(B)\n\nBOXYGEN5\n\nCold Migration\nIt is often forgotten that even with good insulation\ncold can find its way from cryogenic plants and tanks\ninto the ground unless there is a positive heat\nbarrier between the cold part and the ground.\nFor this reason tanks are usually put on stilts to\nmake sure that the air gap between the tank and the\nground will prevent the transmission of cold to the\nground.\nInsulation by itself is not enough, as can be seen\nfrom the example which shows a huge concrete plinth\ncracked by the cold emanating from a liquid nitrogen\npipe embedded in it and insulated from it. As there\nwas no heat break to the atmosphere a temperature\ngradient established itself in the concrete leading\nto the crack and in this case to a hazardous situation\nand great financial loss because the plinth was\nsupporting an atomic accelerator designed to the\nhighest of tolerances.\n\n- 13 -\n\n;Gs.v^L ?.tf-Ci -3\nOF PCOR (KAU7Y\n\nCRACK\n\nINSULATION\n\nThese are but a few of the\nBritish Cryogenics Council\nand in the book many other\ncovering the fluids listed\nbeen considered.\n\ntopics dealt with in the\nCryogenics Safety Manual\nfacets of Cryogenic Safety\nin the introduction have\n\nIt is hoped that the publication will help to bring\nabout increased safety in the production and use of\nCryogenic products through a deeper appreciation of\nthe scientific, technological and administrative steps\nwhich must be taken if accidents are to be avoided\nin future.\n\n'
