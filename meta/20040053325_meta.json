The signal/noise was improved compared to prior spectra obtained in this laboratory by including a filter wheel limiting the band-pass of each spectrum to several hundred/cm. We have measured positions of lines in several weak bands not previously resolved in laboratory spectra. Using our positions and assignments of lines of the Q branch of the 31103-00001 vibrational band at 4591/cm, we have re-determined the rotational constants for the 31103f levels. Q-branch lines of this band were previously observed, but misassigned, in Venus spectra by Mandin. The current HITRAN values of the rotational constants for this level are incorrect due to the Q-branch misassignments. Our prior measurements of the 21122-00001 vibrational band at 7901/cm were limited to Q- and R-branch lines; with the improved signal/noise of these new spectra we have now measured lines in the weaker P branch.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20040053325, "endDate": "1998-06-19T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "Molecular Spectroscopy Symposium", "location": "OH", "id": "151edb2820fb4a5db97cb1800cd33a29", "startDate": "1998-06-15T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20040053325, "id": "98790288886646d69c7850e17ac87ff0", "publicationDate": "1998-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
