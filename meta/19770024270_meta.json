Welds were made in both one gravity and zero gravity (Skylab) environments. Segments from each of the welds were investigated by microhardness, optical microscopy, scanning microscopy, and electron probe techniques. In the 2219-T87 aluminum alloy samples, macroscopic banding and the presence of an eutectic phase in the grain boundaries of the heat affected zone were observed. The stainless steel samples exhibited a sharp weld interface and macroscopic bands. The primary microstructural features found in the tantalum were the presence of either columnar grains (ground base) or equiaxed grains (Skylab). The factors contributing to these effects are discussed and the role of reduced gravity in welding is considered.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19770024270, "id": "b6537d3e8f4341a4a911a5df458a6079", "publicationDate": "1977-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19770024270.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19770024270/downloads/19770024270.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19770024270/downloads/19770024270.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19770024270/downloads/19770024270.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
