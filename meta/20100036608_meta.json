The SSCS consists of a family of three radios which are, Space-to-Space Station Radio (SSSR), Space-to-Space Orbiter Radio (SSOR), and Space-to-Space Extravehicular Mobility Radio (SSER). The SSCS can support up to five such radios at a time. Each user has its own time slot within which to transmit voice and data. Continuous Phase Frequency Shift Keying (CPFSK) carrier modulation with a burst data rate of 695 kbps and a frequency deviation of 486.5 kHz is employed by the system. Reed-Solomon (R-S) coding is also adopted to ensure data quality. In this paper, the SSCS system requirements, operational scenario, detailed system architecture and parameters, link acquisition strategy, and link performance analysis will be presented and discussed", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 20100036608, "id": "eddbada9b0a04de081f25987b1f06b8d", "publicationDate": "1999-04-20T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20100036608.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20100036608/downloads/20100036608.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20100036608/downloads/20100036608.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20100036608/downloads/20100036608.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
