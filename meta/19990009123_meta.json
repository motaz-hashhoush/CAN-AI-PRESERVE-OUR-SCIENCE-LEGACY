A period of data slightly longer than 10 years is examined. The climatologies take the form of the mean estimated (adjusted) rainfall for a 10-year (+) period, with sub-divisions by month and meteorological season. For the six-year period 1992-1997, when two satellites were in operation, diurnal variability (to the extent it is discerned by four unequally spaced observations) is presented. We find an alternating pattern of morning and maxima stretching from the northeast (Atlantic coast) clear across the continent to the Pacific. The effects of topography, coastlines and geography (river valleys) on the rainfall patterns are clear. Interannual variability is examined by computing the deviations of yearly and warm season (DJF) rainfall from their respective long-term means. Interannual variability of the diurnal nature of the rainfall is presented, and the strong El Nino event of 1997-1998 is discussed.", "title": "A 10-Year Climatology of Amazonian Rainfall Derived from Passive Microwave Satellite Observations", "stiType": "PREPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T22:55:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19990009123, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Negri, Andrew J."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Goddard Space Flight Center", "location": "Greenbelt, MD United States"}}, "id": "c99e7b20b1284ead8a42edd0c557a8a9"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19990009123, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Anagnostou, Emmanouil N."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Goddard Space Flight Center", "location": "Greenbelt, MD United States"}}, "id": "a0a3a41128924e2dbb3e169dfe73845e"}, {"sequence": 2, "submissionId": 19990009123, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Adler, Robert F."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Goddard Space Flight Center", "location": "Greenbelt, MD United States"}}, "id": "c46a62e9f01d4434a2d03a73543e2bd5"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Preprint (Draft being sent to journal)", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2018-06-21T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19990009123, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19990009123, "id": "8e466cb56cd848f2a3703251e38708ea", "publicationDate": "1998-09-25T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19990009123.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19990009123/downloads/19990009123.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19990009123/downloads/19990009123.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19990009123/downloads/19990009123.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
