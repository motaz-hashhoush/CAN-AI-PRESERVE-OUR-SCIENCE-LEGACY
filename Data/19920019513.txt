The\nanode terminal is porous and able to form oxygen\nwithin the cell and permit escape of the gaseous oxygen\nthrough the anode and out through a flow line in the\npresence of backpressure. Hydrogen is liberated in the\ncell at the opposing solid metal cathode which is permeable to hydrogen but not oxygen so that the migratory\nhydrogen formed in the cell is able to escape from the\ncell. The cell is maintained at an elevated pressure so\nthat oxvgen liberated by the cell is delivered at elevated\npressure without pumping to raise the pressure of the\noxygen.\n\n--\n\n6 Claims, 1 Drawing Sheet\n\n19\n\nt\n\n10\n\nU S .

This 0 must be sup- 15\n2\nplied at high pressure (i.e., up to 41,368 kPa (6,000 psia))\nto refill EVA 0 bottles. Due to the weight, volume and\n2\nlogistic penalties associated with high pressure 0 re2\nsupply and storage, alternative technologies which Utilize on-board Space Station resources (i.e., electricity 20\nand uarer) such as water electrolysis systems are preferable. The Solid Metal Cathode (SMC) water electrolysis concept offers the capability to generate high pres:\nsure 0 directly, thus minimizing system complexity\nand eliminating the need for a separate mechanical corn- 25\npressor. The key problem in\\,o]ved in this effort included the development of a water electrolysis concept\nwhich uould be capable of safely and reliably generating high pressure Or. The prior technique utilized for\nrecharging the EVA 0 bottles consists of supplying 3O\n2\nexpendable Or bottles with each mission. Upon COmpktion of the mission, the 0 bottles are recovered and\n2\nrecharged. The primary limitation Of the prior technique is that the weight, volume and logistic penalties\nassociated with high pressure 0 transportation and 2 q\n2\nstorage become prohibitive for long-term missions.\nSince these missions will be feature extensive EVA, it is\nessential that an alternative method be utilized. In this\ncontext. the present disclosure is directed to an airborne\noxygen generator system and more particularly to one 40\nwhich incorporates a mechanism capable of forming\noxygen in a space station in circumstances where gravity forces are either small or negligible. It forms oxygen\nas a gas by the electrolysis of water thereby liberating\noxygen and hydrogen. The hydrogen is liberated in 45\nsuch a fashion that it does not pose a problem. Moreover, the oxygen generated by the system can be delivered against very high back pressures, with sufficient\nhigh pressure that oxygen generation provides its own\nsubstantial pressure drive to thereby simplify the system 50\nand avoid the necessity of a separate oxygen compressor or similar equipment, reducing the weight and complexity of the equipment.\nThe present disclosure sets out a system wherein a\npair of spaced, preferably cylindrical or planar elec- 55\ntrodes define an electrolysis cell. The two electrodes\nare separated by a space that is filled with water, and a\nsuitable strong base placed in the water defines the\nnecessary electrolyte. The water can be continuously\nconsumed. The space between the electrodes may also\nbe filled by a porous nonconductive media in which the\nwater and suitably strong base are held by capillary\nforces. As water is converted into constituent gases, the\nwater is replaced to keep the chamber filled. Moreover,\nthe constituent gases are liberated at the spaced elec- 65\ntrodes. One of the electrodes is porous while the other\nis a solid metal member. The solid metal electrode or\nterminal defines a pressure barrier so that one side can\n_Id\n\n2\n\nbe maintained at a reduced or reference pressure while\nthe other side is maintained at an elevated pressure. The\nelevated pressure enables delivery of the pressurized\nliberated oxygen to a pressure storage vessel without\ninterposing a mechanical pump or compressor. Conveniently, the system is illustrated with a water supply and\ncheck valve to assure delivery of the necessary amount\nof water, and the gas u,hich is liberated is delivered\nthrough a check valve into a storage container. Pressure\nregulators can be used to regulate the various segments\nwhen the equipment is not in use\nKnown references include U.S. Pat.

The membranes\nU.S. Pat, No. 4,797,185 shows a fuel cell comprising\na solid electrolyte to increase the mechanical strength\nof the apparatus. This cell appears to be the opposite\nprocess of the present disclosure.\nBy contrast, the present system sets forth a structure\nwhich is capable of attaining pressures as high as 6,000\npsi across the cell. Moreover, this is accomplished so\nthat the gas evolved has sufficient pressure drive of its\nown so that gas is delivered at an elevated pressure\nwithout a pump to overcome limitations on pressure in\ndownstream delivery. In this context, the system is\ntherefore a cell which both generates and pressurizes\nthe oxygen which is necessary for operation of oxygen\nsupported equipment or personnel aboard a space craft.\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF T H E DRAWINGS\n\nSo that the manner in which the above recited features, advantages and objects of the present invention\nare attained and can be understood in detail, more particular description of the invention, briefly summarized\nabove, may be had by reference to the embodiments\nthereof which are illustrated in the appended drawings.\nIt is to be noted, however, that the appended drawings illustrate only typical embodiments of this invention and are therefore not to be considered limiting of its\nscope, for the invention may admit to other equally\neffective embodiments.\nThe single drawing is a cell having spaced anode and\ncathode members with an electrolyte therebetween\nwherein water is supplied for the electrolyte, and hydrogen and oxygen are liberated by operation of the cell\nat a pressure capable of filling a large oxygen storage\ncontainer.\n\n3\n\n5,110,436\n\nDETAILED DESCRIPTION O F T H E\nPREFERRED EMBODIMENT\nAttention is directed to the only view of the drawings\nwhere the numeral 10 identifies the two electrodes and\nsandwiched electrolyte therebetween which make up\nthe electrolysis cell of the present disclosure. The reaction in the cell will be described first and certain features of the surrounding and adjacent support structure\nwill also be given so that the operation of the system can\nbe more readily understood. Moreover, it will be described in the context of continuous operation so that\nwater and electricity are supplied to the cell and oxygen\nand hydrogen gases are liberated. The process further\ncontemplates the capture of the oxygen which is accumulated in a storage vessel at high pressures, pressures\nas high as 6,000 psi. This cell also incorporates a gas\ndelivery system communicating from the cell to such a\nstorage vessel.\nThe present apparatus is constructed of spaced terminals, one being a planar porous anode and the other\nbeing a tubular solid metal cathode. Physically, they are\nspaced evenly so that a chamber is defined therebetween to receive the electrolyte. The two terminals are\neither rectangular or circular. If circular, they can be\nenclosed within a common cylindrical housing and\nhave been illustrated in this fashion. At one end of the\nhousing, hydrogen gas is liberated. At the other end of\nthe housing. oxygen gas is liberated. The disposition of\nthe two gases will be described later. It is sufficient to\nnote for purposes of the present description that a cylindrical housing encloses the two electrodes and the electrolyte therebetween and is provided with a pair of\nterminals for convenient connection to a D C power\nsupply providing a D C voltage of sufficient measure\nand current flow of sufficient magnitude that the necessary amount of oxygen is generated.\nSpeaking in particular about the cell, the cell 10 incorporates a porous anode 11 and an electrolyte region\n12 which is betiveen the anode 11 and a solid metal\ncathode 13. The two terminals are connected with a\n4\npower supply 1 which provides D C current through a\npair of illustrated electrical connections. The current\nflow is directed through the illustrated terminals. Typically, the voltage of the power supply need only be in\nthe range of one and one half to four volts. Typically,\nthe current provided by the power supply must be sufficient to provide an appropriate current density. Current\ndensities can run as high as about 50 amps/ftz or approximately 50 Ma/cmt. Preferably, the cell 12 is filled with\neither potassium or sodium hydroxide in water solution,\nand the water is replenished during operation. To this\nend, the system incorporates a water tank 15 which is\nconnected with a pump 16 which delivers water\nthrough a check valve 17 into the cell 12. The check\nvalve assures that water does not leak out of the electrolytic cell. Thus, the pump is operated at a pressure sumciently high to overcome any backpressure which is\nencountered during operation of the system.\nIn the preferred embodiment, the cathode 13 is a solid\nmetal member which is primarily made of palladium.\nDuring operation, hydrogen is formed in the vicinity of\nthe cathode 13 and it is initially deposited on the surface\nof the palladium cathode. It typically will have an ionic\nform which associates with palladium atoms of the solid\ncathode to thereby form a palladium-hydride transition\ncomplex. Structurally, the palladium is formed into the\nsolid metal structure which, at the atomic level, defines\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\n55\n\n60\n\n65\n\n4\n\na crystalline lattice. This therefore enables hydrogen\nions to diffuse through the solid metal cathode 13 by\nprogressive association from atom to atom within the\nlattice work so that hydrogen ions will diffuse across\nthe thickness of the solid metal cathode 13.As individual ions migrate across. they are ultimately exposed on\nthe remote surface of the cathode 13 and thereby combine to form H l for gaseous collection. In one important\nsense, the cathode serves as a solid metal. In this sense,\nthe cathode serves as a solid metal barrier which is\nporous to the hydrogen ions but which is not permeable\nto hydrogen or oxygen molecules as will be described.\nThe solid metal member therefore enables a pressure\ndifferential to be established across the cell. Thus, the\nin\nhydrogen is collected as free hydrogen gas (H2 form)\nat the exposed face 18 and is conducted away through\nappropriate conduits 19 for storage or other disposition.\nIt is recovered at a modest pressure level. That is, the\nhydrogen flow at 19 has only a modest pressure drive\nbehind it. This pressure drive derives from the rate at\nwhich hydrogen is produced by the system, and that is\ngenerally a scale factor which depends on the surface\narea of the terminals in the cell 10 and the current density.\nThe solid metal cathode is primarily palladium. It can\nbe formed as pure palladium, but the preferred form is\nto place it in an alloy with sufficient palladium content\nto assure permeability in the crystalline lattice for the\nmigration of the hydrogen ions. T o this end, it can be a\nrelatively simple or complex alloy. Care should be taken\nthat the alloy which makes up the cathode has the appropriate electrochemical activity relative to the anode\nfor operation in the system.\nThe numeral 11 identifies the porous anode. It is\nporous or permeable to migration of oxygen molecules.\nThey migrate through the anode 11. They are recovered at the opposite face 20. The oxygen is enclosed\nadjacent to that face and is conducted away from the\nanode by a conduit 21 through a check valve 22 and\nthen to a storage container 24.The storage container is\npreferably operated at a pressure of about 6,000 psi.\nObviously, it will fill multiple storage containers, and\nthey can each be provided with pressure regulators or\ncheck valves. These have been omitted for sake of clarity of the present disclosure. An important factor, however, is thdt the oxygen in the container 24 may be\nstored at pressures as high as 6,000 psi. This requires\ntherefore that the oxygen produced by the anode 11\nmust be raised to a pressure of about 6,000psi or greater\nand which is sufficient to overcome and cause opening\nof the check valve 22 to fill the chamber or container\n24. This requires that the cell 10 be enclosed in a pressurized housing 25. The housing must seal around the\ntwo terminals 11 and 13 to assure that the liberated\ndissimilar gases do not recombine after gas generation.\nMoreover, the housing must provide a hermetic seal\ncapable of withstanding working pressures at 6,000psi\nor greater. Accordingly, the pressure in the region of\nthe anode 11 will be the back pressure which is reflected\nback into the system as a result of operation of the check\nvalve 22 connected to the storage chamber pressure 24.\nAssuming this to be 6,000psi, this requires the system to\noperate at 6,000psi or more. Fortunately, the cathode\n13 is a sufficiently large and thick membrane that this\nkind of pressure differential across the cathode poses no\nproblem. Moreover, the high pressure acting on the\naqueous electrolyte poses no problem to its operation.\nAccordingly, the pressure at the electrolyte side of the\n\n5\n\n5,110,436\n\n6\n\ncathode 13 will be about 6.000psi while the gradient of\nciencies be obtained because the process does othenvise\npressure across the cathode will drop so that it is just a\nconsume substantial quantities of electrical current to\nfew psi at the outlet line 19 where hydrogen is removed.\ndrive the conversion which is described.\nAs noted above, the cell 10 thus incorporates the surAs a matter of convenience, one version of the presrounding housing which seals against both of the termi- 5 en1 system is constructed where the anode 11 and cathrials 11 and 13 to assure that the Produced gases from\node 13 are circular having a diameter up to about two\nthe two terminals are conveyed away and are delivered\nfeet, and has a thickness of about one quarter inch to\nat the requisite pressures.\nabout three inches for each electrolyte cell.
