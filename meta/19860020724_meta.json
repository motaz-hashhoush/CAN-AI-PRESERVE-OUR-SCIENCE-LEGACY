It is characterized by shaft forward circular precession at subysnchronous frequency. Control of the flow pattern in the bearing/seal clearance may enhance the stability. The rotor system demonstrates the dynamic effect of perturbation of the flow pattern in a seal gap by blowing compressed air in the rotor tangential direction. This effect results in shifting the rotor threshold of stability to a higher value of rotative speed when the air jet direction opposes rotation, and to a lower value of rotative speed when the air jet direction coincides with rotation. This effect implies that an unstable rotor can be stabilized by blowing air in the direction opposite to rotation. This technique is known as anti-swirl.", "title": "Anti-swirling demonstration", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-12T18:49:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19860020724, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Muszynska, A."}, "organization": {"name": "Bently Rotor Dynamics Research Corp.", "location": "Minden, NV, United States"}}, "id": "d1ff268f813e44efa216244b4b73c811"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-04-09T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19860020724, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19860020724, "id": "fe74d448366b49ccaa5e91886371429e", "publicationName": "NASA.
