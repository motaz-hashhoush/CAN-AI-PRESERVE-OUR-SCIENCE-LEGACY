An image can be ruined by incidental light in an optical system. To maintain image excellence from an optical system, stray light must be detected and eliminated. TracePro accounts for absorption, specular reflection and refraction, scattering and aperture diffraction of light. Output from the software consists of spatial irradiance plots and angular radiance plots. Results can be viewed as contour maps or as ray histories in tabular form. TracePro is adept at modeling solids such as lenses, baffles, light pipes, integrating spheres, non-imaging concentrators, and complete illumination systems. The firm's customer base includes Lockheed Martin, Samsung Electronics and other manufacturing, optical, aerospace, and educational companies worldwide.", "title": "Stray Light Analysis", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-07T12:51:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-27T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20020076096, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20020076096, "isbn": "0-16-049155-X", "id": "c090b4d4e6c8478c902f264aaf1f140d", "publicationName": "Spinoff 1997", "publicationDate": "1997-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 19970041341, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "Spinoff 1997: 25 Years of Reporting Down-to-Earth Benefits", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20020076096.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20020076096/downloads/20020076096.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20020076096/downloads/20020076096.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20020076096/downloads/20020076096.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
