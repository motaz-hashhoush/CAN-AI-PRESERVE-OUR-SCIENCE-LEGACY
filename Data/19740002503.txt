complete description of the development\n\nand initial\n\nevaluation of the Strapdown Inertial Reference Unit (SIRU) system sponsored by the\nNASA Johnson Space Center under Contract NAS9-8242.\nThe SIRU configuration is\n\na modular inertial subsystem with hardware and\n\nsoftware features that achieve fault tolerant operational capabilities.\n\nThe SIRU\n\nredundant hardware design is formulated about a six gyro and six accelerometer\ninstrument module package.\n\nThe modules are mounted in this package so that their\n\nmeasurement input axes form a unique symmetrical pattern that corresponds\nthe array of perpendiculars to the faces of a regular dodecahedron.\narray provides\n\nredundant\n\nindependent\n\nsensing and\n\nthe\n\nsymmetry\n\nto\n\nThis six axes\nenables\n\nthe\n\nformulation of an optimal software redundant data processing structure with selfcontained fault detection and isolation (FDI) capabilities.\nThis report consists of four volumes.\nVolume I, System Development, documents the system mechanization with the\nanalytic formulation of the FDI and processing structure; the hardware redundancy\ndesign and the individual\n\nmodularity\n\nfeatures;\n\nthe computational\n\nstructure and\n\nfacilities; and the initial subsystem evaluation results.\nVolume II, Gyro Module, is devoted specifically to the Gyro Module, the inertial\ninstrument and its digital strapdown torque-to-balance loop, the mechanical, thermal,\nand\n\nelectronic\n\ndesign and\n\nfunction,\n\ntest\n\nprocedures\n\nand\n\ntest equipment\n\nand\n\nperformance results and analysis.\nVolume III, Software, documents the basic SIRU software coding system used\nin the DDP-516 computer.\n\nThe documentation covers the instrument compensation\n\nsoftware, reorganizational and FDI processing, and the inertial attitude and velocity\nalgorithm routines as well as servicing, input/output, etc. software.\n\n11iii\n\nVolume IV, Accelerometer Module, is devoted specifically to the Accelerometer\nModule, the inertial instrument and its digital strapdown torque-to-balance loop,\nthe mechanical, thermal and electronic design and function and performance results\nand analysis, as it differs from the Gyro Module.\nIn addition to this report, SIRU Utilization Report R-747, has been issued\ndocumenting analyses, software and evaluation activities in the application of advanced\nstatistical FDI algorithms, calibration and alignment techniques to the SIRU system.\nApril 1973\n\niv\n\nTable of

The second, SIRU Utilization Report R-747, is summarized briefly in this\nintroductory section.\nThe SIRU Development Final Report provides an overview of the SIRU project,\nincluding historical background, design concept, hardware mechanization, software,\ntest equipment, reliability and initial test results. In general, it describes the\nactivities and achievements accomplished during the period from May, 1968 through\nNovember, 1971. At that time a complete operational system had been functional\nfor five months and both hardware and software had been debugged and consistent\nsystem operation demonstrated. The report is presented in four volumes as follows:\nVolume I - System Development\nVolume II - Gyro Modules\n\nVolume III - Software Documentation\nVolume IV - Accelerometer Module (CONFIDENTIAL)\nVolume I contains a complete description of the SIRU system concentrating\non the system hardware but covering in adequate detail system mechanization,\ncomputational software and facilities, test facilities, test results and a reliability\nappraisal.\nProgram milestones and conclusions and recommendations are also\nincluded.\nVolume II presents in greater detail the design, operation and test results\napplicable to the gyro modules and Volume IV provides the same information\napplicable to the accelerometer modules. Volume III provides a documentation of\nthe base-line system software including assembly listings and flowcharts.\nThe SIRU Utilization Report presents the results of the additional analysis,\nsoftware development and testing activities provided for under Amendment 7S to\nthe basic SIRU contract. The report is presented in three volumes as follows:\nVolume I - Theory, Development and Test Evaluations\nVolume II - Software Documentation\nVolume III - System Log\n\n1\n\nVolume I contains a complete description of the theory, analysis, implementation\nand test results for each of the tasks, namely:\n\nStatistical\n\n1.\n\nsation\n\nFailure\n\nIsolation\n\nDetection\n\nand\n\nClassification\n\nRecompen-\n\n(FDICR)\n\n2.\n\nError Source Propagation Characteristics\n\n3.\n\nSystem Single Position Self-Calibration\n\n4.\n\nSIRU Self-Alignment (Gyro Compassing)\n\n5.\n\nLocal Level Navigator Performance Demonstrations\nprovides documentation for the additional or modified software\n\nVolume II\n\nVolume III contains a log of significant\n\nincluding assembly listings and flowcharts.\n\nsystem events from the beginning of the system testing program.\n1.1\n\nBackground\nA major requirement for guidance, navigation, and control systems designed\nAs a means for\n\nfor future spacecraft and aircraft applications is high reliability.\n\nfulfilling this requirement, attention in recent system studies has been focused on\nthe use of redundancy concepts with fault tolerant features to achieve an order of\nmagnitude or better improvement in reliability.\nIn the Apollo spacecraft,\n"backup"\n\neach "primary" system was complemented\n\nsystem which had limited mission-mode capabilities.\n\nby a\n\nFor future space\n\nmissions this concept, predicated on a fail-safe return to earth, will not suffice; it\nfails to provide the necessary reliability and operational capabilities for extended\nmissions.\n\nIn commercial and military aircraft, duplex or triplex redundancy in\n\nguidance, navigation, and\n\ncontrol\n\nIn these\n\nbecome commonplace.\n\nsystems has\n\napplications failure isolation decisions and system reconfiguration selection are\nfor the most part assigned to the human operator. Advanced guidance and navigation\nsystems to\n\nmeet improved\n\nincorporate\n\nautomatic\n\ncontrol\n\nair traffic\n\nfailure\n\nand\n\ndetection\n\nrequirements\n\nundoubtedly will\n\nadaptation-especially\n\nin\n\ncritical\n\nguidance phases.\nObtaining\n\nan optimum\n\napproached in several ways.\n\nredundant\n\nguidance\n\nand navigation\n\nsystem can be\n\nA basic decision, however, will involve the geometric\n\narrangement of the inertial sensors.\n\nThe choice is between instrument redundancy\n\nalong commonorthogonal axes and a non-orthogonal array of instruments; in either\ncase the objective is to provide a comprehensive array of measurement data.\nboth approaches\n\nthe\n\nmechanization\n\nshould\n\n2\n\nbe\n\nfree\n\nfrom\n\nsingle\n\npoint\n\nIn\n\nfailure\n\npossibilities, and provide a self-contained failure detection, isolation and processing\nreorganization capability.\n\nThe operation of the failure\n\ndetection and isolation\n\ntechnique must achieve time critical system reliability by eliminating faulty data\nfrom instruments or their electronics before the faulty measurements data affects\nsuccessful mission performance, and the remaining data and processing structure,\nafter reorganization, must have satisfactory mission performance capabilities.\n1.2\n\nHistorical Background\nOn May 7, 1968 the Charles Stark Draper Laboratory\n\nat the Massachusetts\n\nInstitute of Technology submitted a Technical Proposal, in response to NASA RFP\n#BG 731-47-8-533P, to the Manned Spacecraft Center of the National Aeronautics\nand Space Administration for the design, analysis and development of a redundant\nStrapdown\n\nInertial\n\nReference\n\nUnit (SIRU).\nThis unit was intended to replace\ncorresponding assemblies in the Primary Guidance Navigation and Control System\n(PGNC) which the laboratory had designed and developed for the Apollo program.\n\nThis contractual activity marked the culmination of a research and development\neffort to determine and define the fundamental aspects of redundant strapdown inertial\nguidance, navigation and control systems. The redundancy concept was based on a\ndodecahedron configuration for the inertial instruments that had been proposed and\ndelineated inan MIT masters thesis published in 1967.\nDuring the next two years\nunder NASA sponsorship (contract NAS 9-6823) a base of supporting strapdown\ntechnology was created including an inertial grade high torque gyroscope, improved\ntorque-to-balance servo techniques and higher order computational algorithms.\nAs stated in the May 1968 Technical Proposal, the purpose of the SIRU effort\nwas "to design, assemble, and test an inertial reference unit suited to the operational\nreliability requirements of long-term manned space flights. Redundant, structure\nmounted inertial components (strapdown) should be used to provide high reliability\nand freedom from operational constraints (e.g., gimbal lock)".\nThe SIRU was to be configured to interface with the spacecraft planned for\nthe Apollo Application Program (since modified and renamed Skylab). Specifically,\n\nThe former Instrumentation Laboratory of the Department of Aeronautics and\nAstronautics at M.I.T.\n"A\nNon-Orthogonal\nGyro Configuration",\nInstrumentation Laboratory, MIT, January, 1967.\n\n3\n\nJerold\n\nP.\n\nGilmore,\n\nT-472,\n\nthe SIRU would replace the Apollo\n\nPGNC system Inertial Measurement Unit, the\n\nCoupling Display Unit, and the inertial section of the Power and Servo Assembly.\nThe new assemblies would interface with the Apollo Guidance Computer and then\nthe spacecraft to achieve fully redundant guidance, navigation, and control.\nWork under Contract NAS 9-8242 commenced June 27, 1968.\n\nThe Statement\n\nof Work specified that the contract\'s purpose was to develop and deliver one SIRU,\nwhose production version would "meet the reliability requirement for long-term\nmanned space flights."\n\nThe reliability requirement was defined as "the capability\n\nto performa 120-day mission with a.999 mission success probability and a one-half\nhour reentry phase at the end of 120 days with a .9999 mission success probability."\nThe SIRU was to consist of an Inertial Component Sensor Assembly with the\nassociated\n\nelectronics\n\nrequirements.\ncapability\nprescribed.\n\nand\n\nsupplies\n\npower\n\nnecessary\n\nto\n\nmeet\n\nthe interface\n\nA Digital Computational Assembly package to verify the operational\n\nof the\n\nmodified\n\nGuidance,\n\nNavigation\n\nand Control\n\nsystem\n\nwas also\n\nAs a design goal, the complete package (including associated hardware\n\nand harnesses) was to weigh less than 80 lbs with a power requirement of less than\n250 watts.\n\n1.3\n\nDevelopment Summary,\nThe SIRU system consists of a Redundant Instrument Package (RIP) and an\n\nElectronics Assembly (EA).\n\nThe geometric redundancy concept is mechanized\n\nthe Redundant Instrument Package,\n\nwhich contains\n\nin\n\nsix single degree-of-freedom\n\ngyroscope modules and six linear accelerometer modules.\n\nGeometric redundancy\n\nis achieved by using a non-orthogonal mounting configuration in which the instrument\ninput axes (IAs) are oriented to correspond to the array of normals to the faces of\na dodecahedron,\n\nFig. 1.3.1.\n\nThis arrangement yields a unique symmetry in which\n\nall instrument input axes are at a spherical angle (63.40) from each other.\nIn the particular implementation used, pairs of gyro or accelerometer axes\nlie in the orthogonal planes of a reference triad and are displaced about the principle\ntriad axes by an angle.\n\nThis symmetry yields optimal redundant reorganizational\n\ndata processing with minimum error propagation. Moreover, by means of instrument\noutput comparisons, self-contained\n\nfailure isolation of up to two out of six of both\n\ninstrument types is achieved and a third failure of each may be detected.\n\nWith the\n\naid of additional diagnostics, the processing structure still allows continued operation\nafter three failures on both of the six gyro and six accelerometer measurement\naxes.\n\n4\n\na-31\n\n43\' .2.9"\n\nX\n\na\n\nFig. 1. 3. 1 Instrument Input Axes Orientation Relative to\nThe Instrument Frame Triad and the Dodecahedron\nThe RIP is an assembly of gyro and accelerometer modules in which each\nmodule isa prealigned and normalized assembly. The modules are interchangeable\nand include the instrument and its pulse torque-to-balance control electronics,\ntemperature controller, etc. The gyro module is scaled to be compatible with a 1\nrad/sec input and the accelerometer module is compatible with an Apollo 19 g\'s\ncapability. Redundant concepts are also applied in the supporting EA (power supplies,\nclock and scalers, etc.). The levels of redundancy used in the EA are based upon\nthe relative reliability of functional circuits and circuit isolation concepts. For\nexample, to maintain the inherent reliability of the instrument configuration such\nfeatures as triple clock voting, dual scaler channels and six functional power supplies\nare employed.\n\n5\n\nWith respect to reliability, insight into the relative merit of different sensor\ngeometric configurations is provided by a normalized reliability comparision.\n\nThe\n\nvariation of probability of mission success with normalized time for several sensor\narrangements is\n\nillustrated in Fig.\n\ntime-between-failures\n\n(MTBF)\n\nfunctionalized electronics.\nto have the same MTBF.\n\nof a\n\n1.3.2.\n\nTime (t) is normalized by the mean-\n\nsensor axis,\n\nthe instrument\n\nand\n\nits\n\nIn the illustration, all system sensor axes are assumed\n\nFor reference, a reliability curve is shown for a conventional\n\northogonal triad package of three sensor axes.\nsystems with self-contained\nmission\n\ni.e.,\n\nThe other curves correspond to\n\nfailure isolation features,\n\ni.e., three triads (where\n\nsuccess is attained by majority agreement); a\n\nsingle triad with three\ninstruments on each axis (with majority agreement per axis); and the dodecahedron\narray (which allows the failure of any two axes). Note that a marked reliability\nadvantage for the SIRU configuration is clearly observable.\n\nFurther, if external\n\nfailure isolation is assumed so that operation continues until all three triad systems\nfail or a fourth SIRU axis fails, SIRU reliability is 0.999 compared to 0.98 for a\nnormalized time (t/T) of 0.1.\n\nIt is important to note that redundancy alone does\n\nnot supply a complete solution to the problem of system reliability.\nin the system must be selected\n\nEach element\n\nand conservatively applied in a manner that is\n\nconsistent with the environment and the mission duration; there is no substitute for\nquality engineering. Similarly, an element\'s statistical MTBF of one million hours\ndoes not preclude its failure, on a random or defect basis. Thus, the system must\nbe configured to avoid total failure resulting from the failure of a single element.\n\n1.0\nT\n\nMTBF\n\nT= TIME\n0.98\n-.J\n\nSIRU CONFIGURATION\n0C\n\nFAIL ISOLATION FOR ANY\n\n0.96\n3 INSTRUMENTS\n\n0.96\n3 TRIAD\nTRIAD\n\nTWO SENSOR AXES\n\nPER AXIS VOTING\n\nVOTING\n\n0.94\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\nNORMALIZED TIME (7T)\nFig. 1. 3. 2 Mission Success Probability\n\n6\n\nA Digital Computational Assembly (DCA) design was formulated concurrently\nwith the development of the inertial sensor and electronics packages. A representative\nengineering design was developed to fulfill the processing and strapdown algorithm\nsystem requirements and a breadboard unit built. The DCA design concept was\nbased on a general purpose computer with duplex processors, memories and I/O\nsequencers. It was configured to achieve the system high reliability requirements\nand it incorporated multiple error checking, single instruction restart capabilities,\nmicro-programmed sequence generation, and the use of a serial time multiplexed\nThe fabrication of a prototype DCA was not undertaken in this program\ndue to cost considerations.

For a gyro set, the orientation\nyields a relationship between the angular rate inputs (W) about the triad axes and the\ngyro measurements (m) that may be expressed in matrix form in terms of the geometry\nas:\n(2.1)\n\nm = Hb\nwhere\n\nX\nWYW\n\n=\n\nb\n\nm T = [mab\n\nmc\n\ns-s\nH\n\nT\n\n=\n\nd\n\nc\n\n-s\n\nc\n\nO\n\nc\n\nc\n\ns\n\no\n\nm\n\nm e\n\nO\n\nS\n\no\nc\n-s\n\n5 + 1/2\nc\n\n=\n\ncos ( 10\n\ns\n\n=\n\nsin (\n\n)\n\n1\n\n0.851\n0.526\n\nThese relationships reflect the dodecahedron configuration shown in Fig. 1.3.1.\nIn the specific mechanization adopted for SIRU the Y axis is reversed compared to\nthe dodecahedron which introduces sign changes in the equations.\nconfiguration the corresponding matrix H\n\nT\n\n11\n\nis given by:\n\nFor the SIRU\n\no\n\nH=\n\nH\n\nS\n\nso\n\nC\n\nc\n\n-c\n\nS\n0 C 0\n\n0\n\nc\n\nC\n\ns\n\n-s\n\nS\n0\n\nAll the following equations in this volume are representative of this specific\nSIRU configuration. As seen from the equation, each instrument provides a measure\nof redundant data, e. g., instruments A, B, C, and D sense a component of input\nalong the X triad axis. By algebraic solution of the equations, equivalent triad axis\nrate or acceleration solutions can be obtained from any three gyros or accelerometers.\nSubsequent discussion. illustrates that it is possible to isolate up to two failures of\neither type instrument and to detect a third failure through self-contained instrument output comparisons.\nThe processing structure used to obtain equivalent triad solutions from the\ndodecahedron array corresponds to a weighted least-squares solution form:\nA\n\nb\n\nT\n(H\n\n-1\n\nH)\n\n1\n\nT -(\n\nH -1m\n\n(2..2)\n\nwhere b is defined as the "best" triad solution estimate and 0-1 corresponds to a\ndiagonal 6x6 matrix whose terms represent the individual instrument variances.\nThis solution provides a best estimate where both the geometric properties of the\nconfiguration and the individual instrument performance statistics are considered.\nFor the dodecahedron array the computational implementation allows the selection\nof the appropriate triad solution in accordance with the operational status of the\ninstruments in that 0 can be modified to reflect either degraded or failed instrument\nperformance. However, for efficient computational usage and time-critical decision\nand error propagation minimization, only a "go-no go" criterion has been implemented\n(a study to determine the feasibility of generating continuously a weighted leastsquares estimate in an adaptive fashion has been conducted). Thus, processing\nreorganization is achieved by replacement of -1 by a status matrix,X , in which\nall diagonal elements are unity when all instruments perform satisfactorily . By\nsetting the appropriate elements to zero when failures are detected, a least-squares\ntriad solution can be defined for any combination of instruments (i.e., 5, 4, and 3\ngyro or accelerometer combinations). (The actual processing matrices appropriate\nAn additional contract task documented in Report R- 747 covered the implementation\nof a statistical approach which, when combined with the current X implementation,\nprovides higher resolution FDI using a recursive statistical algorithm which also\nclassifies the fault (mean or variance change) and if the fault corresponds to a\nstable mean performance change, recompensates it.\n\n12\n\nfor each combination of gyros or accelerometers are presented in Appendix A). In\nthe computer mechanization, this approach is implemented by storage of common\nparametric elements that may be assembled to form the appropriate least-squares\nsolution based on the status of the instruments, X. This structure is regenerative\nin that, if instrument "healing" is observed in the failure isolation process, the\ninstrument may be reinstated. Thus, the failure isolation criteria enables adaptive\ndata processing.\nAs noted previously, the self-contained FDI to be discussed in subsequent\nparagraphs illustrates that the dodecahedron symmetry enables isolation (determination of the faulty measurement axes, X, X ) and thereby automatic processing\nreconfiguration for up to two of either type of instrument axes failures through\nself-contained output comparisons.\nIn addition, dependent upon the order and\nmagnitude of failures in a sequence of failures, self-contained isolation of a third\nfailure is also achieved.\nUnder all circumstances self-contained detection of a\nthird failure of the same type measurement axis is provided. External monitors\nmay also be used to provide additional \' status data to allow continued operation\nafter as many as three gyro or accelerometer axes failures.\nThe advantage of the dodecahedron self-detection and isolation capabilities is\nclearly illustrated when one considers that a system employing duplex instrument\nredundancy on orthogonal axes experiences total failure with two gyro or two\naccelerometer failures on the same axis, and self-contained isolation of performance\ndegradation between two instruments on the same axis is not possible. Even with\nthree independent triads,only one fault can be isolated when axis-by-axis voting is\nprecluded (as when the triad orientations are not precisely aligned with respect to\neach other or if a fault occurs in a triad system that causes multiple failures in\nthat subsystem). Using triple component orthogonal redundancy in a single system\nwith failure isolation by instrument "voting" between the three instrument signals\non the same axis provides limited capability. A second failure on the same axis\ncannot be isolated. The SIRU skewed configuration yields the most efficient redundant\nuse of six single-degree-of-freedom measurement axes for failure isolation and\nreliability improvement.\nIn principle, any six-instrument, skewed configuration possesses similar\nredundant measurement and failure isolation capabilities. The advantage of the\ndodecahedron array results from its unique symmetry, whereby the six measurement\naxes are spherically distributed with equal angles between all axes. This feature\nminimizes geometric error amplification, simplifies failure isolation and optimizes\nthe response characteristics to provide equalized performance at all attitudes.\n\n13\n\nIndependent studies by Weinstein , have demonstrated that equivalent performance is not attainable with triads that, are rotated with respect to each other to\nobtain a six axes measurement array.\nThe relative\n\nperformance of the SIRU configuration under various failure\n\nconditions may be identified clearly by comparing the SIRU reference triad solution\nstatistics to the corresponding statistics for an operational three axis system.\neach case, all instrument axes are assumed to\nmeasurement error characteristics.\n\nhave identical\n\nIn\n\nand independent\n\nThe statistical performance characteristics\n\nof the failure-free, three axis system are defined as having a standard measurement\ndeviation of\nof (3)1/2 .\n\na along any axis and a total three- dimensional rss measurement deviation\nIn comparison,\n\nwhen all six axes of SIRU are operational, the error\n\nstatistics of its triad solution provide an axis standard measurement deviation of\n1/ 2\n\n0.707a and an rss system deviation of (1.5)\n\n. Similarly; deviations for the SIRU\n\ntriad solutions for the various five, four, and three instrument combinations may\nalso be compared to the basic triad\'s statistics.\nSIRU performance,\n\nThese combinations represent\n\nwith failed instruments detected and isolated, i.e.,\' the failed\n\naxes no longer being used in the triad solution processing.\nIn general, the error propagation of a non-orthogonal array with instruments\ndeleted is such that its triad solution performance statistics reflect both the reduction\nin measurement data and the deterioration in geometry.\n\nThus, dependent on the\n\ngeometric positions of the deleted (failed) axes, the solution tends to have a maximum\nstandard deviation along a specific axis (worst- case) and certain failure combinations\nhave more pronounced rss error amplification than others.\n\nHowever, as illustrated\n\nin Table 2.1.1., SIRU error propagation is bounded and performance is not significantly\naffected by processing with reduced instruments.\nTable 2. 1. 1\nSIRU Performance with Instrument Failures\nVersus\nAn Operational Triad System\nStandard Deviation\n(Worst-Case Axis\nSolution)\n\nRatio of Deviation\n(SIRU Solution to\na 3-axis System)\n\nNone\n\n0.707a\n\n0.707\n\n1 (6 Combinations)\n\n0. 927a\n\n0. 816\n\n2 (15 Combinations)\n\n1. 349a\n\n1.000\n\nInstrument\nFailures\n\n49\n\n3A (10 Combinations)\n\n1. 3\n\na\n\n1. 176\n\n3B (10 Combinations)\n\n2. 890a\n\n1. 902\n\nWeinstein, Warren D., Optimum Skew Angle Between Redundant Inertial Systems,\nGrumman Aerospace Corporation, Bethpage, L.

If\na second instrument failure occurs, inspection of the remaining equations (2.11\nthrough 2.15) allows another level of failure isolation.\n\nIf a third failure occurs and\n\nnone of the equations show a zero total, the failure is detected but not isolated.\nThe conical technique was originally synthesized in the computational software,\nbut parity equations were subsequently used for the third-fail detect function and in\nthe statistical FDI algorithms described in the SIRU Utilization Report Volume II,\nR-747.\n\nThe conical technique is displayed in Fig. 2.1.1.\n\nvectors (B,\n\nNote that each of the five\n\nC, D, E, F) is symmetrically displaced in a conical array about the\n\ncentral vector A.\n\nThis relationship is identical for all orientations because of the\n\nsymmetry of the dodecahedron array.\n\n15\n\n-\n\nNote: B A\ncos 2a\n\nOr\n\ntan 2o - 2\n\nF - A cos 2a\nAOr\n\nS(B\n\nI\n\ncos\n\n____\n\n... +F)\n5 cos2a\n\n2a -\n\nEA\' A-\n\nFig. 2. 1. 1\n\nConical Representation of Dodecahedron Normals\n\nTable 2. 1. 2 SIRU Parity Equations\nInstruments\n\nNo.\n\n- mb)\n\nABCD\n\n(m\n\n2\n\nABCE\n\n(m b - mc)c - (m\n\nABCF\n\n3\n4\n\nABDE\n\n5\n\n-(m\n\na\n\n+\n+\n\n-(ma\n\nABDF\n\nmc\n\na\n\nmd\n\nc +\n\n) c\n)\n\n=\n\n(mc + md)\n\n1\n\n+ m e )s=\n\na\n\n+ (mb + mf) s\n\nc + (mb + me )s\n\n=\n=\n\n(mb - md) c - (ma + mf) s =\n+\n\nIEl\n\nCl\nIl\nII\n\n1E\n\n=\n\n6\n\nABEF\n\n(me\n\nm ) c - (ma+ mb)\n\n7\n\nACDE\n\n(md - me)c + (ma - m c )\n\ns\n\n8\n\nACDF\n\n(m\n\nc\n\n- mf) c+\n\n9\n\nACEF\n\n(m\n\na\n\n- mf) c + (mc- m e )s =\n\n10\n\nADEF\n\n(ma - m e )c + (md - mf) s\n\n11\n\nBCDE\n\n(m c\n\nE\n\ns\n\n+\n\n(ma - m d )s\n\nm e ) c - (mb + md) s\n\n-(md + m ) c + (mb+\n\n=\n=\n\nl\n\n=\n=\n\nmc) s =\n\nE\nK\n\n12\n\nBCDF\n\n13\n\nBCEF\n\n(mb - me) c - (m\n\n14\n\nBDEF\n\n(mb - mf) c - (md + me) s = E]l\n\n15\n\nCDEF\n\n(m\n\nNote: m\nc\n\nc\n\n- md) c + (m\n\nl\n\nc\n\ne\n\n+ mf) s = I\n\n- mf) s =ll\n\n= measurement of axis A accelerometer or gyro\n\ns = sin (a)\n\n=cos (a)\n\nE = Threshold Level\n\n16\n\nUsing spherical representation one can directly derive the relationship between\neach vector and the central vector A:\nmb = ma cos 2a\n\n(2. 3)\nmf = m a cos 2a\nwhere:\ncos 2a\n\n=\n\nNf7\n\nWhen all six instruments are assumed to be operating, six equations, Eq. 2.4, are\nobtained by considering each vector A, B..., F and the corresponding conical array\nof the other five vectors that surround it:\n[m\n\nA\n\nEa =m\n\n-\n\n=\n\n-\n\nEb\n\nEc =\n\nmc-\n\n2(mb\n\n(ma + mc + md + mmb m)\nm +\n\nAf-\n\nEd =\nd - -.\nEd\nm\ne = mme\nA\n\nEf\n\n=\n\nmf-\n\nm - md + me + mf)\n\n(-ma + m b m\n-a\nbo\n\n+ m)]\n\n(-ma + mb + md - m\n\n+\n\n(m.\n\nmb - m\n\nC\n+\n\ne\n\n(2.4)\n\n- mf)]\n\nd- m\n\n. 2 (m a + mb + m e - md - me)\n\nFor each case the individual equations, Eq. 2.3 above, are then combined.

If an instrument\nfailure occurs, the error propagates through Eqs. 2.8 and 2.9. It is dominant in\nthe faulty instruments\' error estimate but is also reflected at reduced magnitude\nin the other instrument error estimates. If one knew which instrument was at fault\nand adapted the processing structure, the corresponding five-instrument variance\n(TSEj ) with the faulty instrument omitted would then equal zero. It can be shown\nthat the relationship between TSE., the faulty instrument error Ej, and the TSE\n\no\n\nis:\nTSE= TSE\n\n- 2 (Ej)2\n\nThus (from Eq. 2.10), if a failure exists, the failed instrument\'s squared\n(E 2 ) corresponds to 50% of the total six-instrument variance (TSEo).\n\n(2.\n\n0)\n\nerror\n\nIf a prior failure has been detected and isolated, a new equation set must be\nused to enable a second failure detection and isolation capability.

If a second\nfailure, 1, occurs, an error propagates in the instrument error estimate Ejk Eq.\n,\n2.13 and TSE j. The error is dominant in Ejl but is also reflected at reduced magnitude\nin the other instrument estimates.\n\nIf the originally failed instrument, j, and the\nnew failed instrument, 1, are deleted from the processing, a corresponding four-instrument variance TSEjk would be computed and would reduce to zero.

The computer\'s failure\nisolation algorithm implements these concepts in the following manner.\nFirst, all\nsix individual errors are computed and Eq. 2.9 is used to calculate TSE . The\ntotal squared error is compared to an allowable threshold, which may be varied\nas\na function of the mission requirement and the dynamic environment. If the system\noperating within the acceptable TSEo criteria, no further activity is required\nuntil the next failure isolation iteration. If the TSE threshold is exceeded,\nthe\nratio of each individual instrument error, Eq. 2.4, is squared and taken with\nrespect\nto the TSE . If, for example, E 2 is a significant percentage of TSE\no\na\no exceeding a\nselected magnitude, the failure of instrument A is indicated.\nis\n\nThe presence of a second failure is\n\ndetected when the TSE.\n\nthreshold is\n\nexceeded.\n\nThis failure is isolated by taking the ratio of E jk to TSEj and if E exceeds\n2\nTSE and if Ejl exceeds\na selected magnitude, the failure is isolated to the 1 instrument.\nWhile the theoretical\n\nmaximum squared error\n\n(E.)\n\n2\n\nfor the first failure\ncorresponds to 50% of TSE, Eq. 2.10, and (Ejk) for the second failure corresponds\nto 40% of TSEj, Eq. 2.14, practical considerations require that an isolation\nratio\nthreshold be chosen which is lower than these theoretical values. The\nisolation\nratio threshold is defined as R equals E /TSE\nfor the first failure, and for the\nsecond failure, R 1 equals Ejk/ TSEj. Since the use of quantized data and the acceptable\nnoise and residuals associated with the instrument population increase\nall the E\nterms and the TSE, use of the theoretical values would result in undetected\nfailures.\nThe use of too low a value would result in false alarms.\nA plot is shown in Fig. 2.1.2A which provides an indication of the safe\nregion\nfor quantifying the detection and isolation thresholds.\nThis plot shows the largest magnitude ratio, R for an instrument E\nn which\nhas not failed (Curve 1) and the corresponding smallest ratio R\no for an instrument\nEj which has failed (Curve 2). These ratios are plotted for a\nnormalized signal to\nnoise expression N that is the ratio of the instrument axis accumulated\noutput (signal)\nto the maximum noise magnitude (quantization, uncompensated\nresiduals, etc.) that\nmay be expected in that output. Thus N is the ratio of a failure measurement\nerror\n\n20\n\nto the background noise or error residuals of good instruments.\n\nIn these plots the\n\nmagnitude of the noise is a maximum ( \xc2\xb11 ) but its signs (+ or -) are considered to\nbe equally probable. The curves in the figure result from averaging all of the\nworst-case noise-values assuming + and - to be equally probable.\n0.5\n\n/\n\n/\n\n/\n\n/\n\n/\n\n/\n\n/\n\n// /\n\n/\n\nRegion of Possible Missed Failures\nCurve 2: R\n\nfor E. failed\n\n0. 4\n\n0.3\n\nRegion of Proper Operation\n\no\n\ntO\n\n0.2\nRegion Controlled by Instrument Noise\nA\n\nCurve 1: R for E n unfailed\n0.1\nRegion of Possible False Failures\n0\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n-4\n10\n\nRatio of Signal to Noise\nFig. 2. 1. 2A TSE vs Signal-to-Noise Ratio Operating Range-First Fail\nViewing Fig. 2.1.2A, note that if the R. ratio for failure isolation were selected\nbelow Curve 1, false alarms would routinely occur, (i.e. an unfailed instrument\ncould yield a En/TSEo greater than the selected Ro). Similarly, if the R o ratio\nwere selected above Curve 2, missed alarms would occur, i.e. a failed instrument\ncould not yield E /TSE o greater than the selected R o . Thus, to assure reliable\nfailure isolation a R should be selected in the region between the two curves.\no\nNote that the crossover point of the two curves occurs at 1.\nAs expected, in the region to the left of this crossover no decisions can be\nmade since the signal and the worst-case noise are equal. As noted previously,\nthe FDI cycle is initiated when the TSE threshold is exceeded, providing identification\n\n21\n\nthat a failure exists.\n\nThe discussion on the curves thus far has reflected on those\n\nregions of Ro selection that yield reliable failure isolation.\nCombined\nthresholds.\n\nFDI\n\noperation is\n\na\n\nfunction\n\nof the selection of both of these\n\nThe TSE threshold is selected on the basis of the anticipated signal to\n\nnoise (S/N) ratio.\n\nThe TSE flags the presence of a failure when it is large enough\n\nto assure that noise can not cause an erroneous isolation decision.\n\nFor the first\n\nfail search, the TSE must correspond at a minimum to a S/N ratio of 1. Conservatively,\nsince crossover at a higher S/N ratio is possible, a larger S/N criteria should be\nused. For example, if all the outputs have a maximum noise component, the specific\nworst-case sign polarity (probability of 0.03), and an accumulation in which polarity\noccurred at every iteration throughout the FDI period (probability approaching zero),\nthe crossover in Fig. 2.1.2A would move to approximately a S/N of 5.5. Similarly\nthe lower Curve 1, would move up and become asymptotic to a ratio of 0.2.\n\nIn\n\npractice, to provide adequate detection reliability margin, a TSE threshold criteria\n2\nof approximately 2 x 6_O or 2 x 6AL2 error or greater is used.\n\nderived from Eq. 2.10, where TSE = 2E ).\n\n(The factor of 2 is\n\nIn a static environment, with gyro drift\n\nresiduals bounded within 0.10 0 /hr, a 6 min accumulator used with the TSE = 2 x 6(.O) 2\nthreshold would correspond to approximately 0.15 0 /hr degradation detection where\nAO =\n\n5.5 sec.\n\nTo accomodate for dynamics, an effective A0 of approximately 20\n\nsec has typically been used.\nThe combined first fail FDI uses a TSE criteria that reflects an S/N ratio\ngreater than 6 and a failure isolation ratio, R, greater than 0.35. Empirically,\nlaboratory testing has demonstrated that a ratio as high as 0.44 provides highly\nsensitive and reliable FDI performance.\nA second set of curves, see Fig. 2.1.2B, applicable to the second FDI is developed\nusing the same approach.\n\nNote that the crossover point of the two curves in Fig.\n2.1.2B also occurs at 1. This second fail search FDI curve also reflects a worst-case\n\nnoise situation and illustrates a somewhat reduced safe R 1 selection region (area\nbetween Curve 1 and 2) since the lower Curve 1 is asymptotic to 0.15 vs 0.1 on\nFig. 2.1.2A. Similarly the true fail ratio asymptote (Curve 2) has reduced from\n0.5 to 0.4. For the absolute worst-case condition (the sign of all noise terms having\na specific polarity distribution),the crossover for this second fail case moves to a\nS/N ratio of approximately 9 and the Curve 1 asymptote is 0.3.\nThese factors\nillustrate that second fail detection and isolation threshold selection does not have\nas much margin as the first fail FDI. This finding is intuitively obvious since\nthere are fewer comparative measurements.\n\nConversely, if one wishes the same\nsecond fail FDI reliability, some degradation in fault isolation resolution capability\n\n22\n\nwill occur.\n\nFor example, FDI reliability equivalent to the previously discussed\n\nillustration of a 0.1o/hr fail degradation isolation would correspond to a 0.15 0 /hr\n(TSEjk = 2 x 9A02 capability in the second fail search.\n\n0. 5\n\nRegion of Possible Missed Failures\n0. 4\n\nCurve 2: RI for Ejl failed\n0. 3\nRegion of Proper Operation\n0\n\n4\n\n0. 2\n\n-\n\nRegion Controlled by Instrument Noise\n\nH\n\nCurve 1: R 1 for Ejk unfailed\n\n0.1\nRegion of Possible False Failures\n\n0\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\nRatio of Signal Noise\nFig. 2. 1. 2B TSE vs Signal-to-Noise Ratio Operating Range-Second Fail\n\nIn testing, a second fail isolation ratio of 0.38 has been used with good resolution\nA 20 sec effective A9 has been used in the TSEjk criterion to\n\nand high reliability.\n\nallow for dynamic environment noise.\n\nDetailed analyses that provide definitive\nassessment of the FDI reliability are presented in the SIRU Utilization Report, R- 747.\nRedundancy Management\nThe software redundancy management system implements the FDI concepts\nand equations discussed above in the following manner. Prior to each attitude and\nvelocity algorithm iteration, the failure detection and isolation algorithms operate\n\n23\n\n14\n\non measurements accumulated at the system iteration rate (100 iterations/sec and\n50\n\niterations/sec\n\nhave\n\nbeen mechanized\n\nin the SIRU software).\n\nThus the FDI\n\nalgorithms operate to detect and isolate a failure prior to each system iteration.\nIf a failure is detected,the least-squares matrix processing, Eq.\nto reflect the failure and only the current good data is\n\n2.2, is modified\n\nprocessed through to the\n\nattitude andvelocity algorithms. Thus, no known bad datais used. The FDI algorithm\nuses individual accumulators for each instrument\'s measurement data. The accumulators are incremented at each iteration by the new data sample.\n\nThus, at each\n\niteration, the accumulator represents the sum of past and new data.\n\nThe extent of\n\nstorage, i.e., past data accumulation, is selected on the basis of the desired FDI\nresolution (e.g., for the gyros, an equivalent drift). Periodically, all the accumulators\nare simultaneously purged of an equal time interval of their oldest data.\n\nThe finest\n\ndetection and isolation resolution is therefore obtained at the FDI test just prior to\na purging (the maximum interval storage capability).\n\nThe minimum resolution is\n\nobtained at the FDI test of the accumulator data remaining just after a purging.\n\nIn\n\ntest demonstrations a six minute accumulator, purged of old data every two minutes,\nhas been used. These time parameters are selectable based on the desired resolution.\nThe tradeoff considerations are discussed later in this report.\nAfter a first failure is\nfailure.\n\ndetected and isolated, a search is made for a second\n\nThe data used in this search does not include the measurement data in the\n\naccumulator\n\ncorresponding to the axis that was identified as failed in the prior\n\nfirst fail search. However, the prior failure is continuously examined (its accumulator\ncontinues to be incremented) by returning to the original first fail search equation.\nThis operation allows recertification\n\n(use again in forward processing) should the\n\nfailure heal (e.g. the failure may have been due to a transient condition).\n\nThus the\nfirst fail search is continuously repeated. Similar provision is made for recertifying\na second failure.\n\nAfter a second failure has been isolated, the appropriate parity\n\nequation is also examined for a third failure detection.\nThe ranking of failures for the purpose of failure management is as follows.\nIf there are two failures, that failure which exceeds the isolation threshold ratio,\ncomputed using data from all six instruments, is ranked first and is considered to\nbe the worst failure.\n\nThe other instrument failure is ranked second.\n\nIf there is a\nthird failure, the second ranked failure and the third failure are included in the\nisolation ratio computation using data from five instruments ( the first ranked failure\nis excluded). The instrument exceeding the isolation threshold ratio is ranked second.\nIf it is the same instrument that was previously ranked second, the failure detection\nalarm is continued and the third failure cannot be isolated by software alone.. On\nthe other hand, if the third failure exceeds the second fail isolation threshold ratio\n\n24\n\n(in the 5 instrument test), it is ranked second and taken off-line.\nsecond ranked instrument is now ranked third and remains off-line.\nthird failure has been successfully self-isolated.\n\nThe previously\nIn this case a\n\nThis capability was successfully\n\ndemonstrated toward the end of the SIRU Utilization program by an example in which\nthe third failure was approximately 10 times greater than the original second failure.\nAn illustration of the error detection process is shown in Fig. 2.1.3 using\ndata from an actual test on the SIRU system. This figure shows a plot of the E 2\nJ\nmagnitude output (in pulses squared) for all instrument axes as a function of test\ntime. The detection TSE threshold used in this test sequence corresponded to\n2 x 12A 2 pulses where AO was 5. 5 sR (an E. errorof 66 s).\nThe failure isolation\nratio used was 0.44. A simulated failure was introduced in the A axis gyro (bias\nmiscompensated by 25 meru after 120 seconds of normal system operation). Note\nthat the E a error magnitude increases until the failure detection threshold is exceeded,\n150 seconds after the failure was introduced. At that point the failure is isolated\nto the A gyro. After isolation, the A gyro data is no longer processed, and the\nerror propagation in the estimate of B through F instrument errors is reduced\nsignificantly. The resultant system attitude error during this time interval, Fig.\n2.1.4, shows the gyro drift rate error propagating as an attitude error until detection\nand isolation occur. The total error accumulation caused by this A gyro failure is\nless than 15 sec in both the X and Z axes. Note that the failure detection is\ntime-dependent since it is based on the magnitude of accumulated E 2 pulses, but\nthe attitude error is bounded within 28 sec (for the particular magnitude of TSEb\nused in this test demonstration) for an isolated failure regardless of the magnitude\nof the instrument drift rate error.\nIt should be noted that the propagation of an error into the system attitude\noutput, as shown in Fig. 2.1.4, occurs because the processing of data continues\nuntil sufficient error develops to enable a failure detection and isolation decision.\nIn other words, a finite time is required to accumulate sufficient data to enable a\nFDI decision. During this time (until the TSE criteria is exceeded) the error\npropagates through the least-squares processing to the attitude algorithm. The\nbounded maximum error for the first FDI corresponds to the instrument angle error\nE. times one half the cosine of the dodecahedron half angle, 0.425 (see Appendix\nA).\nThis reduction in the error propagation magnitude is attributable to the\nleast-squares processing, six instruments being weighted geometrically, thereby\nreducing the effect of a single instrument\'s measurement error. Generally,this\nattitude error propagation has negligible influence on a mission since the basic\ndrift detection resolution must be compatible with acceptable performance over an\nentire mission phase. Thus, if 0.37 0 /hr drift uncertainty performance is the limit\n\n25\n\nDEGRADATION\n\n160\n\n-\n\nDETECTED & ISOLATED\n\nTo\n\na\n\n120\n_ 8"A"\n\nC-\n\nGYRO ERROR\n\n80\n\nr\'\n\nB-F\nGYRO\nERRORS\n\n"A" GYRO BIAS SHIFT\n25 MERU\n0\n\n60\n\n10\nTIME (s)\n\n120\n\nFig. 2. 1. 3\n\n20\n\n3do\n\n360\n\nFailure Simulation - STRU\n\n15\nDEGRADATION\nDETECTED & ISOLATED\n10\n\no\n\n5\n\nLJI.\n\n0~\n\n0\n\n-5\n\nA GYRO BIAS SHIFT\n\n-10I\n\n0\n\n60\n\nI\n\n120\n\nTIME\nFig. 2.1.4\n\nI\n\nI\n\n180\n\n240\n\nI\n\n300\n\n360\n\n(s)\n\nFailure Simulation - SIRU\n26\n\nfor acceptable drift performance during a mission phase,the influence of a 15 sec\nerror associated with the FDI of a 0.38 0 /hr drift error is negligible.\n\nClearly, the\nrelative performance resolution capabilities are therefore the principle interest.\nThe resolution, given a.specific TSE criteria, is a function of the system noise, the\ncalibration residuals, and the FDI accumulator storage time. The tradeoffs involved\nin the choice of these parameters are discussed in the next section.\n\nIt should be\nnoted, however, that dependent on the computational complex supporting the instrument hardware configuration, processing schemes can be implemented that would\nnot yield a resultant attitude error when a performance degradation failure above\nthe FDI thresholds occurs.\nFor example, in a three computer complex all data\nfrom the six measurement axes could be used in all computers for FDI, but only\nselected sets of four axes of data would be processed in each computer through the\nleast-squares matrix.\n\nThus, an attitude error due to the time the failure took to\nbe detected and isolated would appear in only those computers that were using in\nits four axes processing the specific instrument that had failed. At least one computer\nfor a single failure case would not reflect an attitude or velocity error due to this\nfailure and all computers, since they were using all axes in their FDI processing,\nwould know which axes had failed. Therefore,each computer would know the relative\nstatus-of its data.\n\nThe velocity and attitude status of the affected computers could\n\nbe reinitialized, and the processing equation sets reorganized to assure that a second\nfailure could be tolerated in the same manner by at least one unaffected computer.\nFDI Threshold. Tradeoff Considerations\nIn the present implementation, the gyro failure isolation criteria achieves\ndetection and isolation in 35 seconds for a performance deterioration equivalent to\na 100 meru change in bias.\n\nProportionately longer times are required for detection\n\nof smaller performance changes.\n\nWith the current 6 minute accumulator and a 4\ncm/sec pulse weight, accelerometer bias changes equivalent to a 0.1 cm/sec 2 can\nalso be detected and isolated. Equivalent detection and isolation is achieved for\ninstrument scale factor (SF) and alignment degradation.\nBecause of the nature of the nominal uncertainties associated with SF and\nalignment in strapdown error propagation, special FDI considerations are required\nfor operation in the laboratory where continuous test revolutions are often imposed.\nScale\n\nfactor or alignment\n\ndegradation corresponds\n\nto a change\n\nfrom\n\nthe\n\ncalibrated AO or AV pulse weight or an angular change in an instrument\'s input\n\n27\n\naxis orientations from its previous calibrated orientation.\n\nErrors due to these\n\ntypes of degradation do not propagate, however, until rotation (for the gyro) or a\nspecific force (for the accelerometer) is sensed.\n\nThus, a SF or alignment change\n\nin combination with, for example, a slew (constant rate) input results in an angle\nerror.\n\nThis angle represents an equivalent drift magnitude during the slew period.\n\nOf significance in a mission, however, is the attitude error resulting from a SF or\nalignment change and its effect on guidance and navigation.\n\nThe attitude. or velocity\n\nerror for the ternary loops used in SIRU is proportional to the total attitude maneuver\nor velocity change.\n\nIn a static environment with only earth rate and gravity inputs,\n\nthe error associated with a 1000 ppm SF shift in a single gyro (sensing the major\nportion of earth rate) corresponds to 0.015 0 /hr drift. This type of error propagation\nis within the calibration uncertainties of drift terms.\nuncertainties\n\nconsistent\n\ncapabilities is\n\non the order of\n\nwith\n\nperformance has been achieved.\n\ncurrent\n100\n\nmoderate\n\nppm and\n\nRepresentative SF calibration\nperformance\n\ntechnological\n\nin the SIRU configuration 20 ppm\n\nFor many applications an uncertainty on the order\n\nof 200-300 ppm at the start of the mission and over the entire maneuver profile\nmay prove satisfactory. For example, from the Space Shuttle trajectory once around\nabort studies error coefficients,\n\npresented in Appendix A of the SIRU Utilization\n\nReport, R-747, a 200 ppm gyro SF error in the worst axis would correspond to\napproximately a 4.4 nautical mile cross track error at the 100,000 foot entry altitude.\nClearly, in a static prelaunch environment large SF deviations can exist, while due\nto the nature of their propagation characteristics in this environment, the corresponding attitude error would be perfectly acceptable.\n\nSimilarly, since the TSE\n\ntype FDI uses individual axis body frame attitude error estimate accumulations\nover a finite period, relatively large gyro SF and alignment errors would not cause\n2\nthe failure threshold levels to be exceeded. For example, with an E 2 = 37 sec\n2\ncriteria ( 6Ae\nwhere AO = 5.5 sec) and a six minute accumulation and, if all the\nearth rate is\n\nabout the specific gyro, a failure would be identified only if the SF\n\nhas degraded by at least 6,800 ppm (corresponding to approximately 0.10/hr drift).\nOperation in such an environment with this type of degradation is perfectly acceptable.\nOn the other hand, if one were to apply an input to a system rate test of 5 0 /sec, a\nSF degradation of only 5.7 ppm could cause the FDI thresholds to be exceeded in\nonly six minutes.\n\nEven if E\n\n2 =\n=\n\n12 sec 2 was used\nN\n132\nin the FDI logic, the failure\n\nthreshold would be exceeded for a SF degradation of only 20 ppm.\n\nIn both cases SF\n\nuncertainties of this magnitude are perfectly acceptable while the FDI indications\nwould be anuisance.\n\nClearly, the FDI goal is to detect and isolate a SF degradation\n\nlevel in SIRU in excess of 100 ppm.\n\nThus to circumvent nuisance problems and\n\nachieve a detection capability consistent with a realistic SF and alignment degradation\n\n28\n\nFDI goal, an algorithm was implemented that increased the TSE limit on the basis\nof the dynamic input environment.\nthe\n\nThe technique used was to open the threshold on\n\nTSE based upon the magnitude of a triad solution body angle accumulation.\n\nThat is, the TSE is increased by an amount proportional to the magnitude of the 0x,\n0\n\ny\' 0z body angle traversed in the same six minute FDI accumulation period. For\n\nsimplicity, however, rather than generating a vector magnitude, the TSE increment\n(ATSE in sec 2) was made proportional to the sum of the magnitude of the individual\ntriad body axis accumulations, e.g.: the ATSE is synchronized with the FDI\naccumulators and it updates the TSE limits prior to each FDI test.\nThe scaler K, during the test program, was set so that the TSE was increased\nby 44 sec\nfor every 1 / 8 radian accumulated. This scaling is equivalent to opening\nthe TSE to allow for a SF degradation of approximately 150 ppm (i.e. if rotation\nwas essentially about the degraded axis) under a constant slew test. The considerations\napplicable to alignment shifts are essentially identical and the scaling corresponds\nto approximately a 30 se alignment shift detection capability.\nThe isolation resolution\n\nperformance capability of the SIRU\n\nsystem TSE\ntechnique as a function of the FDI accumulator storage time for different effective\nquantization (AO) levels is illustrated in Fig. 2.1.5. Quantization levels of 44 sec,\n20 sec and 6 sec are shown in the figure. The limiting condition is for 6 sec resolution\ncorresponding approximately to the present SIRU gyro interpolator quantization.\nNote in the figure that when the storage time exceeds 600 seconds, all of the curves\nflatten out and there is little to be gained by longer accumulator storage time.\nDuring the test program, storage times used varied between 3 and 6 minutes. In\nthe six minute accumulation, for convenience, the old data was purged every 2 minutes.\n(One minute purge cycles were implemented with the 3 minute accumulation). The\nsix minute accumulation represented the maximum accumulation storage time and\ntherefore the highest resolution FDI. The 4 minute value remaining immediately\nafter the oldest two minute portion of data had been purged represented the lowest\nresolution FDI for the six minute accumulation.\n\nThese values (360 and 240 seconds\nrespectively) occur at the knee of the 6 sec quantization curve and for this value of\nquantization the accumulator storage times are therefore optimum. The theoretical\nperformance isolation resolution corresponding to these storage times is on the\norder of 0.1\xc2\xb0/hr. This 0. 0\no/hr value corresponds to using six times the 5.5 sec\nquantization noise for Ej in the TSE threshold and a 6 minute accumulator storage\ntime.\n\n29\n\n1.0\nAB =20\n\nAG 44se"\n8\n\n0.8\n\n-J\n\n0.6\n\n0. 4\n\n,\n0\n\nU-\n\nS0.2\nLi\n\no\n\nBoundary Capability 6 sgc Quantization\n\nt\n\n0\n\n400\n\n800\n\n1200\n\n160\n\nTIME ( seconds )\nFig. 2.1.5\n\nIsolation Capability vs Accumulator Storage Time\n\nIn the SIRU hardware testing, use of a TSE based on the 6 sec quantization\nhas resulted in occasional "false alarms", i.e., failure indication of a specific\ninstrument on a transient basis where no failure has actually occurred.\n\nThis\n\nphenomenon was traced to the occurrance of a spurious burst of 2-3 pulses which\nresulted innonet integrated angle but did, in the presence of other residuals, cause\nthe TSE to be exceeded during an FDI accumulation cycle time. Thus, on a transient\nbasis, an instrument was taken out of the data processing structure until the\naccumulator purged the transient data burst and requalified the instrument (approx.\n120-180 sec later). The noise effect, although random and infrequent, was traced\nto the long cable run, (approx 50\') and the table slip ring interface between the\ngyro module outputs and the computer. An effective quantization corresponding to\nthe AO = 20 sed curve in Fig. 2.1.5 was used initially to allow for this noise phenomena,\nequivalent to operating with a TSE of approximately 2 x 2402 with AO equal to 5.5\nsec. Subsequent dynamic testing illustrated that an equivalent noise in a two minute\naccumulation period on the order of 18 see could be induced by 1 Hz, 1/2 -p\noscillations. Therefore the 2 x 132 sec 2 TSE criteria was retained as a nominal\nthreshold. The accumulator structure was not optimized to correspond to a more\nsensitive drift resolution (from Fig. 2.1.5 tenminutes would be more optimal) since\nthe software was sufficient to demonstrate the FDI mechanization and the new\n\n30\n\nstatistical FDI did not require this type of accumulation approach.\n\nDuring static\n\ntests, however, finer resolution capabilities were demonstrated, e.g., Fig. 2.1.3\nr-. 2\nillustrates a 2 x 66 sec TSE criteria corresponding to an effective Ae quantization\nof 11\n\nec. A 0.1\n\n0\n\n/hr FDI with a six minute accumulator was demonstrated in static\n\ntests when driftresidual uncertainties were bounded within approximately 0.01 50/hr.\nFigure 2.1.6 shows the error propagation in attitude (sec) as a function of the TSE\n\n140\n\n120\n\n(\n\nM\n\n0.62\n\n2\n\nO 100\n\nH\n\n80\n\n2\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n\n40\n\n80\n\n120\n2S\n\n.Fig. 2. 1. 6\n\n160\n- Threshold-\n\n200\nsec\n\nFault Isolation Threshold vs System Error Propagation\n(Single Soft Fault)\n\n31\n\n240\n\n2\ndetection threshold (in sec) . As discussed previously, an attitude error is propagated\nuntil the failure is detected and isolated. This curve shows the linear relationship\nof the maximum system attitude error (resulting from the least-squares processing).\nThe maximum error reflected in a single triad reference axis corresponds to 0.425\nand 0.62 of the instrument error (E ) that is accumulated prior to exceeding the\nTSE threshold and to isolation of a first and second fail respectively (Appendix A).\nAs the effective quantization noise is lowered, the system attitude error propagation\nis also lowered since the detection threshold can be lowered. With 6 s quantization,\nthe attitude error is less than 20 sec. When the effective noise is 20 ec the system\nattitude error propagation is about 50 sec. A quantization of 44 gc, used prior to\nthe incorporation of the torque loop interpolator, results in an error propagation of\n112 sec. The second failure condition reflects a somewhat higher magnitude of\nattitude error propagation since, after the first failure, the least-squares processing\nuses the remaining five axes of data. Thus, when another failure occurs, the smoothing\neffect degrades. As noted previously, if a redundant computer implementation was\nused, simple logical utilization of different sets of measurement axes datain different\ncomputers for the algorithm processing would assure that at least one computer\nwould be identified as retaining a non-degraded system output.\nTable 2. 1. 3 Demonstrated Redundancy Capabilities\nFault Detection and Isolation\nNo False Alarms\n3 Min\n\nFilter\nSoft Failure:\n(Drift Change)\n\n0.75 0 /hr\n0. 2 cm/sec 2\n\n6 Min\n0. 375\n\n0\n\n/hr\n\n100 ppm SF as low as 0. 05 rad/sec input\nQuantization Limit:\nAO = 6 se\n\nAV = 4 cm/sec\n\n(Random False Alarms on Noise Burst)\n0. 180 /hr\n\n0. 13 cm/sec\n\n0.09 0 /hr\n2\n\n0.065 cm/sec 2\n\nDemonstrated Results-Hard or Soft Failure:\nNo False Alarms\nSystem Attitude Error\nVelocity Error\n\n60 sec\n-15\n\nRandom False Alarm\n16 se\n\ncm/sec\n\nTable 2.1.3 summarizes the significant performance values for the SIRU TSE\ndetection and isolation methods for both gyros and accelerometers.

Transformation from the dodecahedron to the triad reference frame is accomplished with a\nleast-squares estimator operating on the six axes of body data.\n\nIf an instrument\n\nfailure occurs, the matrix processor rejects that instrument\'s output and accurately\ncompiles the triad data from the remaining instruments\'\n\ndata.\n\nThus, redundant\n\nperformance is exhibited in the triad data.\nThe triad data is used to furnish estimates of the environment when required\nto compensate the appropriate parameters (as examples, acceleration sensitive gyro\ndrift, misalignment angles and OA coupling).\n\nBecause the triad data is immune to\n\ninstrument failures, the compensation scheme is also immune to instrument failure.\nThus the inherent redundancy features are maintained by the use of the triad data\nfor compensation.\n\nFor example, since the A-gyro\'s ADIA term (as determined in\n\nstatic test) is corrected for g level by using a triad solution derived acceleration\nresolved back into the A-gyro IA axis, the loss of the A-accelerometer does not\ndegrade the compensation of the A-gyro.\n\nThe computer memory and percent of machine time required to accomplish the\ndata processing described above is summarized inTables 2.1. 4A, 2.1. 4B, 2.1. 4C.\nTable 2.1.4A shows the memory requirement for all of the routines applicable\nto the operating SIRU system, and Table 2.1.4B shows the percentage of computer\ntime required at selected iteration rates.

The scaler output lines are separately buffered to assure fail-safe\noperation.\n\nIn both the scaler and oscillator implementation, provisions for test\nsequencing of all the combinations are included.\nIt is important to note that with respect to the dc power supply and the scaler,\nthe electronic system configuration was mechanized to provide only fail- safe isolation\ncharacteristics because the relative reliability of the particular functional elements\nwas used to determine the redundancy level to be implemented. For example, the\nestimated failure rate of a 40v power supply is less than 10 failures per million\nhours whereas a gyro module failure rate estimate might range between 100 and\n200 failures per million hours, determined principally by the inertial instrument\nand the torque electronics. Thus, dual redundancy is sufficient for the dc power\nsupply; it does not compromise the end-to-end system reliability index and still\nprovides fail-safe operation. Similar considerations were applicable to the dual\nimplementation of scalers. Inclusion of a third scaler and dc power supply would\nrepresent a relatively simple design modification.\n2.2.2 Module Electronics\nEach gyro and accelerometer module includes its own temperature controller,\npreamplifier, torque control loop,etc. Scale factor stability and linearity performance on the order of 3 and 20 ppm respectively has been achieved with the present\ninstrument control loop within a 1 rad/sec design range.\nA functional block diagram of the gyro module is shown in Fig. 2.2.2. Note\nthat an Interpolator/Compensator is included in the ternary torque-to-balance loop\nfunction.\n\n40\n\nsupplies because a dual- redundant implementation would have necessitated a complex\nand possibly unreliable system of independent failure detection monitors and switching\nnetworks.\n\nEach\n\ngyro and\n\naccelerometer module includes its own\n\ntemperature\n\ncontroller, ternary torque-to-balance control loop and other specialized instrument\nelectronics.\n\nThe mechanization allows for the incremental\ninstrument\n\nmodule to be\n\nstored\n\nAO and AV outputs of each\n\nredundantly in an interface multiplexer.\n\nThe\n\nmultiplexer would then transmit data and receive control and sampling messages\nfrom the computer assembly on dual buses. A serial data transmission format\nwould be used.\n\nThe multiplexer included\n\nprovisions for digitized analog data\n(voltages, etc.) for automatic monitoring to enable more extensive fault localization,\ne.g. to replaceable modules.\n\nThe multiplexer was designed but not incorporated in\n\nthe SIRU system due to program funding limitations.\nRedundant dc power distribution to the functional axes is achieved by the use\nof dual dc power supplies. These supplies are designed so that each can independently\nsupport the total load of all functional axes.\n\nThey are isolated from each other by\n\ndiode networks to provide fail-safe operation.\n\nProvisions were made to allow for\n\nthe addition of another dc power axis if further contingency planning was desired,\ni.e., Fail Operational/Fail Safe.\nDiscussion of the design implementation of the dual\npower\n\nfor the\n\ngyro torquing\n\ncurrent,\n\n4\n\n0v supply which provides\n\nprovides insight\n\ninto the special design\nconsiderations that are required to avoid a system failure due to a single-point\nfailure mechanism. First and most obvious, the diode interconnection is provided\non a per-axis basis to assure the availability of 40v power to the gyro modules if\neither of the two supplies fails due to a low output level or to an internal short\ncircuit ahead of the diode. Similarly, to protect against a gyro module short circuit,\nfusing is incorporated\n\non a\n\nper-axis basis.\n\nThis feature assures that the\n\n4\n\n0v\ndistribution to all other gyro modules (a solid- state fuse design has been formulated)\nis not influenced by a loading fault.\nAnother more subtle reliability design\nrequirement, fail-safe voltage regulation feedback, has been incorporated to insure\nthat the 4 0v input to the gyro module torque loops remains within regulation limits.\nIf the 40v were to go above the regulation limit, performance degradation could\noccur on all axes.\n\nTherefore, each 40v module has dual-redundant feedback loops\nthat regulate and limit its maximum output voltage. The dual feedback loops operate\nto insure that if one loop fails the remaining loop will prevent the module voltage\nfrom exceeding the regulation limit. Other design features allow 100% continuous\noverload without affecting regulation of the module output.\n\n39\n\nTEMPERATURE CONTROLLER\n\n28\n\ni-.\n9.6 KHZ\n\n..\n\nYRO\n\n---- ---------T\n\nNORMALIZATION\n\nTEMPERATURE\n\nAIGCNMENT .\n\n7\n\n--------\n\nr -------- ,\n\n----\n\n0V\n\nSUSPENSIONS\n\nA\n\nHEATER\nTORU ERC\n--- ---\n\n4I\n\nTORUELECTRONT\n\nSWCHTEE\n\nUMMY\n\n800H z 2 0\n\nV\nCONTROL\n\nENATO\n\n-\n\n-\n\nSIGNAL G\n\nERPATOR\n\n5V\n\nTIMINGH\n\n10 V\n\n------\n\nSENSOR\n\n8V\n\n15v\nV-PITP"\n\nTORUERPULSES\n\n--- -- -\n\nC\n\n-20V-\n\nPEMSATOR\n\n-- TIM\n\n--- -- -- --\n\n-- -- --\n\nI IN\n\nFig. 2. 2. 2 A Functional Block Diagram of the Gyro Module\nIn standard ternary loop operation, the gyro signal generator (SG) output is\nsampled and, when the SG signal reaches a given threshold, the control logic applies\na torque current pulse to the gyro torque generator to return the gyro float to its\nnull position.\nTiming pulses to the logic control the current pulse width,\nand\nprecision current amplitude control is effected by a current feedback loop that\noperates on the basis of a comparison between the PVR and a current sampling\nresistor.\nThe Interpolator/Compensator provides a dual function..\n\nAs a compensator\n\nit substantially eliminates the effect of the dynamic characteristics of the gyro float\nand linearizes the gyro torque loop output response to the applied input rates.\nWithout this compensation, lagging gyro float response to a torque pulse can result\nin multiple pulsing. In the uncompensated ternary pulse torque-to-balance control\nloop at an interrogation rate of 4800 pps and with a float inertia to output axis\ndamping ratio (I/C) of 330 microseconds, multiple pulsing does occur.\nIn the\n\n41\n41\n\naccelerometer loop, with the 16 PIP Mod B I/C ratio so much smaller than for the\ngyro,\n\ncompensation\n\nfor float dynamics was not\n\nconsidered necessary.\n\nAs an\n\ninterpolator, at each interrogation period the unit samples and holds the analog,\ncompensated SG signal, performs an A/D conversion, shifts in parallel the digital\ndata pulses into a serial register and finally sends them to the computer accompanied\nby an end-of- data pulse. The digital data is quantized such that each pulse is equivalent\nto approximately 5.5 arc seconds or 1 / 8 of the 44 are second torque pulse. Explanation\nof the operation of the Interpolator/Compensator is provided in further detail in\nChapter 3.\nThe torquer compensation module includes RC networks that tune the torquer\nso that it is a resistive load for the current switch and provides a trim resistor\nfor the "dummy" TG load.\n\nIn the ternary torque loop when torque is not required,\n\nthe current is applied to a "dummy" load which is also a heater (equal in resistance\nto the torquer) located on the gyro TG alignment end mount.\n\nThe purpose of this\n\nmodule is to minimize transients in the current control loop.\n\nThe switching of the\n\ncurrent to the "dummy"\n\nload minimizes these transients in two ways.\n\nWhen no\n\ntorque is required to be applied to the gyro the same current level is fed through\nthe "dummy"; thus the dc amplifier sees essentially a constant voltage, regardless\nof the torquing state.\n\nIn addition using this "dummy" as a heater on the TG end\n\nmount tends to maintain a relatively constant thermal input to the gyro, reducing\nloop transients and thermal gradients as well.\n\nThe 8v power supply is also located\n\nwithin the module to minimize lead capacitance which affects switching time in the\ncurrent switch.\n\nA dc temperature control loop is used in the gyro and accelerometer module.\nIt is novel in that the control power includes the output transistor\'s dissipation.\nThe applied power,\n\ntherefore, is a linear function of control current and a more\n\nefficient power mechanization results.\n\nThis efficiency is achieved by mounting the\n\noutput power transistor on the instrument alignment mounts (where the heater is\nalso located) permitting the transistor dissipation power to serve also as control\npower.\nThe accelerometer module electronic configuration is similar to the gyro\nmodule, except that the Interpolator/Compensator functionis not incorporated. The\nSIRU torque loop scaling characteristics are listed in Table 2.2.1. The features of\nthe electronics design are described in further detail in Chapter 3.\n\n42\n\nTable 2. 2. 1 SIRU Instrument Torque Loop Characteristics\nA)\n\nGyro Torque Loop\nType:\n\nLinearized Ternary\nPulse Torque-to-Balance\n\nDynamic Range:\nTorque Loop Quantization:\n\n1 rad/sec\n44 s\'/pulse\n\nInterpolator Quantization:\n\n5 se/pulse\n\nTorquer Power:\n\n2. 94 watts-1 rad/sec\n\nB) Accelerometer Torque Loop\nType:\n\nTernary Pulse\nTorque-to-Balance\n\nDynamic Range:\n\n19 g\n\nTorque Loop Quantization:\n\n4 cm/sec per pulse\n\nTorquer Power:\n\n0. 78 watt-19. 5 g\n\n43\n\nPRECEDING PAGE BLANK NOT FILMED\n3.0 System Hardware\n3.1\n\nElectronics Assembly and\nRedundant Instrument Package\n\nThe configuration that has been developed for the SIRU system embodies its\nreliability features in a modular implementation for improved maintainability. The\nsystem is configured as two separate assemblies; the Redundant Instrument Package\n(RIP) and the Electronics Assembly (EA).\nThe RIP consists of a mounting and alignment structure, commonly referred\nto as the n-frame, upon which the six gyro and six accelerometer modules mount.\nThe assembled instrument package is shown in Fig. 3.1.1.\nEach module consists of a prealigned gyro or accelerometer that is normalized\nand packaged with its calibrated electronics in a sealed unit. The instrument\'s\ninput axis (IA) is offset at an angle, a (31.70), with respect to its module base.\nThus, when the modules are mated to the -frame\'s precision mounting surfaces,\nwhich lie in orthogonal planes, the instrument\'s IAs are aligned to the desired\ndodecahedron symmetry. This mounting configuration allows all units to be prealigned\nin exactly the same manner, and all modules of each type are replaceable and\ninterchangeable.\nOffsets from module instrument alignment to system alignment\nmeasurements after mounting\n\non the n-frame have averaged less than 10 sec.\nfurther enhanced by the n-frame configuration that allows direct\naccess to every instrument from the front of the package.\nMaintenance is\n\nOne interesting aspect of this mechanical configuration is that all instrument\noutput axes (OAs) are colinear with the reference orthogonal triad. This circumstance\npermits compensation for errors introduced by dynamic inputs about the OA using\ncalculations\n\ndeveloped\n\nfrom\n\nthe triad\n\nsolutions\n\nwithout additional\n\ngeometric\n\nresolution.\nThe accelerometer module has been designed about the MIT developed size\n16 Permanent Magnet (PM) Pulsed Integrating Pendulum (PIP), a single degree-offreedom specific-force receiver operated in a torque-to-balance mode. It is primarily\ndistinguished from its predecessor, the Apollo PIP, by a permanent magnet torquer\nand a solid float.\nThe\nIntegrating\n\ngyro module\n\nhas been designed about the size 18\n\nGyroscope (18\n\nIRIG)\n\nMod\n\nInertial\n\nReference\n\nB, a single degree-of-freedom\n\ngyroscope\n\n45\n\nFA\n\nFig SIRU Instrument Package\n3 1B1\nFig.\n\n3. 1. 1 STRIT Instrument Package\n\ndeveloped by MIT/DL\n\nspecifically for strapdown application.\n\nIts PM torquer is\n\nscaled for torque-to-balance operation with input rates up to one rad/sec, and the\nOA suspension capability is sized to limit radial side loading at this rate to a negligible\nvalue.\n\nIt contains a gas bearing wheel package, with a greater than 5 rad/sec slew\n\nand\n\nmultiple stop-start\n\na\n\ncapability.\n\nA -final\n\nreport\n\ncovering the design and\n\ndevelopment of this instrument has been published as MIT Draper Laboratory Report\nR-664 dated June 1970.\nThe\n\npackaging\n\nsystem developed\n\nby the\n\nU.S.\n\nNaval\n\nAvionics\n\nFacility,\n\nIndianapolis (NAFI) was used in the design of the EA as shown in Fig. 3.1.2.\n\nThis\n\napproach was selected because, among other features, it permitted the definition of\nthe\n\n-frame structural design independently of the status of the electronic module\n\ndesigns and packaging.\n\nThe EA design was configured so that functional redundant\n\nelements are completely separate mechanically and electrically.\n\nThus, an oscillator\n\nmodule or portions of a scaler, etc., may be removed without disabling the system.\n\nFig. 3.1.2 SIRU Electronics Assembly.\n\n47\n\n3.1.1 Weight, Volume, and Power\nThe weight, volume and power requirements of the RIP and the EA are shown\nin Table 3.1.1. Project funding did not permit the development of microminiature\nelectronics and the interface requirements limited possible size reductions. A\nproduction design without these restrictions would result in significant weight, volume\nand power reductions. A further breakdown of the components of the RIP is shown\nin Table 3.1.2.\nTable 3. 1. 1 SIRU Weight, Power, and Volume\nWeight\n(lb)\n\nVolume\n(in 3 )\n\nPower\n(watts)\n\nRedundant Instrument Package (RIP)\n\n62. 94\n\n1753.84\n\n182. 4\n\nElectronics Assembly (EA)\n\n33.50\n\n1155.00\n\n124.0\n\n2908.84\n\n306.4\n\nAssembly\n\n6.25\n\nRIP-EA Harness\n\n102.7\n\nTotals\n\nTable 3. 1. 2 Redundant Instrument Package\nAssembly\n\nQty\n\nDimensions\n(in)\n\nWeight\n(lb)\n\nPower\n(watts)\n\nGyro Module\n\n6\n\n5 1/4x4 3/8x4\n\n4.35\n\n23.0\n\nAccelerometer Module\n\n6\n\n4 1/4x3 7/8x3 9/16\n\n2.64\n\n7.4\n\nn-Frame\n\n1\n\n20 1/ 4x15 1/16x5 3/4\n\n21.00\n\nThe SIRU configuration satisfies manned spacecraft design considerations\n(vacuum, thermal by conduction, etc.) and can be compared with the Apollo Inertial\nSubsystem (ISS) which has similar packaging density. The total Apollo equivalent\n3\nISS weight, volume and power is 93 lbs, 2654 in and 216 watts, respectively. To\nachieve the same relative reliability as SIRU, such as would be required for the\nspace shuttle, three to four such systems would be required.\nAs a development model constrained by the time line, fiscal and interface\nfactors specified in the authorizing contract, the present RIP does not represent an\n\n48\n\nultimate design miniaturization, although it is a realizable competitive equipment\n(the use of hybrid medium scale integrated electronic\n\npackaging\n\nfor example, could reduce the system weight by over 50%).\n\nIt serves\n\nconfiguration\ntechniques,\n\nto demonstrate the redundancy, the failure detection and isolation capability and\nthe performance level to be expected\n\nfrom this type of equipment using a high\n\nreliability, low risk packaging technique.\n3.2\n\nRedundant Instrument Package\n\n3.2.1 Inertial Component Mounting Concept\nThe formulation of a mounting concept for the inertial components (ICs) in\nthe SIRU system was finalized after examination of all design objectives and\nconstraints. The basic considerations were mounting frame complexity, instrument\nenvironmental\n\nnormalization\n\nmodule\n\nsensitivities,\n\nrequirements\n\nand\n\ninterchangeability goals. Each of these basic considerations included supplementary\nelements that had to be considered with respect to each other without violating the\nobjectives of in-flight maintainability and of form factor compatibility with the Apollo\nCommand Module Lower Equipment Bay.\nFigure 3.2.1 shows one possible conceptual approach. This mechanization\naligns the gyros such that all spin axes (SAs) are normal to the Z axis. The resulting\nadvantage lies in the elimination of one of the g-sensitive drift terms during thrusting\nalong the Z axis. The major drawback to this configuration is the degree of complexity\nrequired\n\nin the mounting frame.\n\nFigure 3.2.2 presents\n\nthe concept that was\n\nimplemented.\n\nThe simple box shaped schematic reflects the ability to position the\ninstruments in three orthogonal planes while maintaining each instrument\'s IA aligned\nnormal to the face of a regular dodecahedron.\nUsing the "box" approach, several choices were available for the arrangement\nwhich provides the dodecahedron angle. Figure 3.2.3 illustrates two methods. In\nthe first, the IA is aligned normal to its mounting base and the angle is machined\ninto the mounting structure.\n\nIn the second, which was the method selected, the\n\ndodecahedron angle is achieved at the module level.\n\nFigure 3.2.4 shows the IA\n\nThe contract required mechanical and electrical interface compatibility with the\nApollo GN&C equipment (see Chapter 1, Introduction).\n\n49\n\nIA\nOA\n\nSA\n\nIA\n\nSA\n\n...\n--- r\\ S\n4\n\nFig. 3. 2. 1 Alternative Layout Gyro Spin Axes Normal to Z Axis\n\nz\n\nz\n\nD\n\nE\n\nC\n\nD\n\nF\n\nE\n\nX\n\nFig. 3. 2. 2 Implemented Layout IAs Normal to Dodecahedron Faces\n50\n\nAligned on Fixtu re with SIRU Angle\nAlignment Pins Required.\n\nIA Aligned IBase No Alignment\nPins Required.\n\nIMPLEMENTED DESIGN\n(b)\n\nALTERNATIVE DESIGN\n(a)\n\nFig. 3. 2. 3\n\nPossible I/C to 7T-Frame Interfaces\n\nMODULE-COVER\nMOUNTING SCREWS (3)\n\n0\n\nTHERMAL ISOLATION\n\nTEMPERATURE CONTROL MODULE\nTORQUE ELECTRONICS MODULE\nMOUNTING BLOCK\n\no\nLINE DRIVER MODULE\n\n8V POWER SUPPLY MODULE\n\nCONTROL & DUMMY\nTORQUER HEATER\n\n-AZIMUTH\n\nINTERFACE MOUNTING PADS\n\nBASE INTERFACE MOUNTING PADS\nALIGNING RING\n\n16 PM PIP\n\nMOUNTING FLANGE\n\nFig. 3. 2. 4 Accelerometer Module Mounting & Alignment\n\n51\n\nalignment of the accelerometers and Fig. 3.2.5 illustrates the fixturing and test\nmethod utilized to achieve the proper IA alignment for the gyros.\n\nThe arrangement\n\nfinally chosen represented a modification of the "box" approach which placed all\nthe instrument modules on the front face with the coldplate heat exchanger mounting\nfrom the rear.\n\nThe resulting structure is referred to as the r-frame.\nSURFACE B\n\nALIGNMENT ADJUSTMENT\n\nrol\n\nSIRU GYRO ,MODULE\nTABLE ROTARY\nAXIS\n\nA\n\nALIGNMENT\nFIXTURE\n\n,sRAA\n\ni-\n\n~\n\nBASE PLATE\nALIGNMENT\nINTERFACE P!N\n\n-!\n\n_\n\nB_LLEVILLE\n\nPLATE\n\nSURFACE A\n\nTRUNNION\n\nAXIS\n\nFig. 3. 2. 5\n\nAlignment Adjustment SIRU Gyro Module\n\nThe selection of this configuration resulted\nmounting\n\nstructure\n\nwith\n\nno sacrifice\n\nin\n\nin the simplest design of the\n\ninterchangeability\n\nand\n\nperformance.\n\nExperience has shown that replacement of a module in the system can be accomplished\nin less than ten minuteswith a minimum possibilityof damage and with an alignment\nrepeatability better than 20 sec.\n\n52\n\n3.2.2 Mechanical Design of SIRU Redundant Instrument\nPackage\nThe SIRU RIP assembly layout is shown in Fig. 3.2.6 with its wiring harness\nremoved. This assembly consists of a\n\n-frame, six gyro modules, six accelerometer\n\nmodules, and acoldplate with overall dimensions of 19-7/8 inches by 15-1/16 inches\nby 5-3/4 inches and a weight of 70 lbs. with its harness.\n\nP i\n\nFig. 3. 2. 6\n\nSIRU RIP\n\nThe design objectives shown in Table 3.2.1 determined the RIP configuration.\nIt was originally intended to be mounted within the Apollo Command Module Lower\nEquipment\n\nBay with the coldplate connected\n\nto the spacecraft\n\ncoolant lines.\n\nRIP was to be removable without breaking these coolant lines.\n\nThe\n\nThe frame was\n\nmade as symmetrical as possible to obtain the structural rigidity and mounting\nstability necessary to maintain the alignment accuracies required\nsystem in a\n\nflight environment.\n\nThis symmetry also contributed to good thermal\n\ndesign, providing minimum thermal\nthree-ball\n\nkinematic mounting\n\nfor a strapdown\n\ngradients from\n\narrangement\n\nnavigation base or to the test base.\n\ncomponent to component.\n\nwas used\n\nto mount\n\nthe\n\nRIP\n\nA\n\nto the\n\nThe parts used in this mounting arrangement\n\nare identical to the Apollo Optics Assembly mounting hardware.\nprealigned and modularized for interchangeability.\n\nThe frame design was constrained\n\nto be as simple as possible for ease of fabrication.\n\n53\n\nThe ICs were\n\nStructural dimensioning and\n\ndesign tolerances necessary to meet the mechanical requirements shown in Table\n3.2.2\n\nFigure 3.2.7\n\nwere implemented.\n\nshows the ir-frame consisting of a 6061\n\naluminum dip-brazed structure with inserts for mounting the instrument modules.\nThe ICs are mounted on four mutually perpendicular planes (the Y axis plane is\nsplit in two to keep the design compact and symmetrical).\n\nAn optical cube mounted\n\non the under side of the Z axis plane is visible through a hole in the plane and from\nthe X and Y directions.\n\nA flat mirror is also mounted on each of the IC mounting\n\nplanes.

The action is accomplished by closing\na ternary loop around the gyro by means of precision current pulses to the gyro\ntorquer. The general specification requirements for the gyro module including scale\nfactor and drift parameters, input and output power and signal characteristics and\ntolerances, thermal limitations and other system features are provided in Appendix\nC.\n\nModularized IC assemblies were incorporated in the SIRU system to meet\nthe requirement for in-flight maintenance.

The fluid isolates\nthe float from environmental inputs and provides the damping which is an essential\ncharacteristic of the single degree-of-freedom (SDF) integrating gyroscope. The\nfloat inertias and compliances about the SA are matched to those of the IA to minimize\ndynamic errors from these sources.\nThe permanent magnet torquer (PMT) is capable of developing 150,000 dyne-cm\nof torque, sufficient to balance an input rate of one rad/ sec. Tapered electromagnetic\nsuspensions provide radial and axial stiffness capable of restraining the float at\nthe rated input angular velocity. The angular position of the float from its null\nlocation is measured by a multiple E type signal generator (SG).\nwhen excited by an 8v, 9600 Hz source is 20 mv/milliradian.\n\nSG sensitivity\n\nThe instrument is hermetically sealed within a Mumetal shroud to augment\nm agnetic isolation, aid heat transfer control and protect the gyro from unauthorized\nadjustment. Temperature control and monitoring are provided by four nickel wire\nwound sensors controlling heaters which are located on the gyro end mounts. The\ncomplete instrument measures approximately 2 inches in diameter and 3 7/8 inches\nlong. Weight is 1.15 pounds. A summary of the characteristics of the 18 IRIG Mod\nB gyro is presented in Table 3. 2. 4.\nPulse Torque-to-Balance Operation\nThe gyro in the SIRU system operates in a closed loop where the torques on\nthe float are restrained by torques developed by the torque generator (TG). See\nFig. 3.2.11.\nAn angular rate imposed about the IA of the gyro produces a torque about its\nOA and causes the float to rotate from the SG null position. The direction and\nmagnitude of the float rotation are detected by the SG, and when the SG output voltage\nreaches a given threshold level, a discriminator provides a positive or negative\nset signal, depending on the polarity of the SG output voltage. These set signals\nare interrogated at a given frequency to switch a current pulse of fixed amplitude\nand duration to the TG winding. In the control loop mechanization, a principle error\nsource is inaccuracy in the torque pulse area. For example, a torque pulse of 100\nma amplitude and 200 microseconds width exhibiting a variation from nominal\n\n60\n\nTable 3.2.4\n\n18 IRIG Gyroscope Characteristics\n\nSingle Degree of Freedom Floated Gyroscope\nWeight:\n\n1.15 lbs (523 gms)\n\nSize:\n\n2 inch (5.08cm) Diam.\n\n3.86 inch (9.8cm) Long\n\n* Wheel:\nSelf acting spool type gas bearing (Aluminum oxide)\nAngular Momentum - 150,000 gm-cm2/ sec (24000 RPM)\nMaximum Capabilities -.5 RadlIsec about IA\n> 50 g\'s 60-400Hz\nSynchronous Motor - 4 pole 24 28v 800Hz\n2.6 wattsl/ running\nDrift Sensitivity - 0.00401 Hr per Volt\n\n*\n\nTORQUER:\nPermanent Magnet - 8 poles, Alnico V IX, ring\n1 Rad I sec at 3 watts\n\n* COIL HOLDER - 8 coils on Beryllium Oxide holder\n* SF SENSITIVITIES TO FLOAT MOTION:\nRadial 50ppm for 0.4x 10-3 inches,\nEquiv. to 1.0 Rad / sec about OA\nAxial -\n\n50ppm for 0.25 x 10- 3 inches,\nEquiv. to 10g accel or 20 Foff flotation\n\nRotational -\n\n50ppm mill i Rad\ni.e. 3ppm for\n\nThermal -\n\n10ppm / OF\n\n* STABLE MAGNET CHARACTERISTICS\nDecay 60ppm per decade\n(magnetized after assembly)\n*\n\nLOW DRIFT SENSITIVITY- ForTorque Power Cycling\n\n61\n\npoles\n\nTable 3. 2.4 IRIG Gyroscope Characteristics (Cont)\n\n* Thermal:\n* Flotation Temperature - 1329\'\n* Drift Sensitivity -\n\n* Storage\n\n<.030 Hr per F\n\n200F - 180oF nominal\n\n* Miscellaneous\n* Gyro Elastic Restraint <0. 1 dyn cm per mr\n* Float & Housing - Beryllium\n* Fluid - Brominated fluorocarbon\n\n* Magnetic - vacuum shroud\nSuspension:\n* 8 Pole - Electromagnetic Tapered Suspension\nPrevents radial side-loading <1 Radl sec - OA\nPrevents axial loading <20g 20 F\nReaction torque sensitivity < 0. 015"1 Hr - 17.

No.\n2304040 and the corresponding schematic for the accelerometer module is Dwg.\nNo. 2640424.\n\n2.\n\nGyro Pulse Torque Electronics\n\nThe function of the gyro PTE is to receive the output from the gyro SG, evaluate\nthe threshold level in the torque control logic and, if ordered, supply current pulses\nto the gyro TG as required to reduce the SG signal below the threshold. The width\nof the current pulse is controlled by timing pulses transmitted by the torque control\nlogic and the amplitude of the current pulse is maintained by a feedback loop involving\nthe comparison of a\n\nprecision voltage reference (PVR)\n\n63\n\nand a current sampling\n\nresistor. The current pulse is transmitted to the gyro TG through a current switch\nwhich is set by the torque control logic to provide the appropriate polarity.\n\nThe\n\noperation of the PTE is described in detail below.\nThe output signal\n\nfrom the gyroscope is\n\nfirst amplified by a bandpass\n\npreamplifier, fed into the ac amplifier (x10) in the PTE and then to a comparator\nor threshold device (essentially a strobed Schmitt trigger).\nAs shown in the Timing Diagrams, Figs. 3.2.12 and 3.2.13, and the logic\ndiagram, Fig. 3.2.14, the comparator is strobed by the leading edge of the 4800 pps\ninterrogate pulse (INT) which coincides with the peak of the 9600 Hz signal at the\ncomparator. A phase shift adjustment is made in each module to the SG signal in\nthe bandpass amplifier to insure this relationship.\n\nIf, (referring to Fig. 3.2.14) at\n\nthe instant of strobe (INT), the peak level of the amplified SG voltage exceeds the\npositive threshold level (equivalent to 44 sec input) and is in phase with the INT\npulse, a positive level detect signal is generated which sets the positive level detect\nflip-flop (+LDFF) to its positive state. The output of the +LDFF then sets the torque\nmotor set flip-flop (TMSFF), (Fig. 3.2.15), to its negative state (S2,4=-; S3,5=+).\nThe positive output of the TMSFF turns on Q3 and Q5 which sets up the current\nswitch for a negative torque current command.\nThe output of the +LDFF is also summed with the reset and INT pulses in the\nAO AND gate to generate a AO pulse upon receipt of the reset pulse. This\nAe pulse goes to the computer.\n\npositive\n\nThe output of the +LDFF also goes to the torque switch AND gate where it is\nsummed with the INT and the switch pulses. When the switch pulse occurs, a torque\nswitch pulse is generated which sets the torque switch reset flip-flop (TSRFF) to\nits switch state so that its output turns on Q6 and turns off Q7. This sets up the\ncurrent switch to send current to the torquer winding instead of to the "dummy"\ntorquer.\nAfter 195.33 microseconds, the INT pulse (4 microseconds wide) starts,\nfollowed 2 microseconds later by the reset pulse (0.4 microseconds wide).\n\nThese\n\npulses are summed in the torque reset AND gate which sends a pulse to the TSRFF\nswitching it back to its reset state so that Q6 turns off and Q7 switches on, returning\nthe current flow to the "dummy" torquer load.\nA similar sequence occurs when the negative threshold level is exceeded except\nthat a positive torque current and a negative Ae are generated.\n\n64\n\n+ THRESHOLD\n\n-\n\n9600 Hz Si G.

The SIRU loop has demonstrated a long term amplitude\nstability of 10 ppm.\nThe mode of operation for the accelerometer loop is intrinsically identical.\nMinor parameter differences result from the relative torquer requirements and\nnormalization practices at the instrument level. The general characteristics of\nthe accelerometer and its module are shown in Table 3.2.5.\nThe timing inputs to the torque control logic are reshaped by means of pulse\nreceivers, one for the interrogate and one for the switch pulse train. The calibration\nstability of the module is largely dependent on the rise time characteristics of the\npulse trains. Low noise performance is achieved using a single diode level "standoff"\ncoupled to a fast rise, two stage pulse amplifier. Output AB lines are transmitted\nto the computer through line drivers to compensate for possible variation in\ntransmission line length, performance characteristics and pickup, -The line drivers\nconsist of blocking oscillators designed to provide ground decoupling and a high\nlevel of cable drive power.\n\n68\n\nTable 3. 2. 5 SIRU Module/PIPA Characteristics\n\nPIPA Module\n1.\n\nDimensions\n\n2.\n\nVolume\n\n4. 3 in. x\'3.9, in, x 3. 6 in.\n58.4 in. 3\n\n3.\n\nWeight\n\n1170 gm\n\n4.\n\nPower\n\n9 watts\n\nPIPA\n1.\n\nPhysical Description\na)\n\n2. 1 in.\n\nb)\n\nDiameter\n\n1. 6 in.\n\nc)\n2.\n\nLength\nWeight\n\n354 gm\n\nConfiguration\na)\n\nSignal Generator Type\n\nMicrosyn\n\nb) Torque Generator Type\nc)\n3.\n\nPermanent Magnet\nFloated and Magnetic Suspension\n\nPendulum Support\n\nPendulosity\n\n1 gm cm\n\n4.\n\nDamping Coefficient\n\n120, 000 dyne-cm/rad/sec\n\n5.\n\nOperating Temperature\n\n1300F\n\n6.\n\nTorque Parameters\na)\n\nPulsed-Ternary\n\nb)\n\nNominal Scale Factor\n\n4 cm/sec/pulse\n\nc)\n\nInterrogation Rate\n\n4800 pps\n\nd)\n7.\n\nMode\n\nMaximum Torque\nRebalance Capability\n\n19. 0 g\n\nPower\na)\n\n0. 04 watts\n\nTorque Generator\n\n0. 75 watts\n\nc)\n\n3.\n\nSignal Generator\n\nb)\n\nMagnetic Suspension\n\n0. 6 watts\n\nInterpolator/ Compensator\n\nThe Interpolator/Compensator (schematic Dwg. No. 2304154) provides a dual\nAs a compensator it substantially eliminates the effect of the dynamic\ncharacteristics of the gyro float and linearizes the gyro torque loop pulse\noutput\nresponse to the applied input rates. Without this compensation, lagging\ngyro float\nfunction.\n\nresponse to a torque pulse can result in multiple pulsing.\n\n69\n\nIn the uncompensated\n\nSIRIU pulse torque-to-balance control loop at an interrogation rate of 4800 pps and\nwith a ratio of float inertia to OA damping of 330 microseconds,multiple pulses do\noccur. In the accelerometer the ratio is much smaller and compensation for float\ndynamics was not considered necessary.\nThe float response to a single torque pulse provides insight into this effect of\nlagged response on closed loop operation. Less than one fifth of the total float\nmotion response to a single, fixed magnitude torquing pulse, 195 microseconds in\nduration, occurs in the first sampling period (at the 4800 pps interrogation rate).\nThus, if the angular rate about the gyro IA is in excess of 15% of the full-on torque\nloop capability, the torque loop will always pulse again because only 15% of the\ncommanded return travel has occurred before the next interrogation. Over a total\nindicated angle the pulse bursting results in an instantaneous reading error and the\nbase AO resolution is not realized. A compensation technique to eliminate this\nproblem is shown in Fig. 3.2.17. Analog voltages, \xc2\xb1E Comp, are developed by\ngenerating a 206.3 microsecond pulse from a flip-flop circuit which is set and reset\nby the AO and interrogate pulses, respectively. This pulse, which is approximately\nthe same length as the torque command (195.3 microseconds) is integrated by an\nRC network to generate a voltage of the proper phase and magnitude so that when\nsummed with the gyro SG signal, the combined signal compensates for the gyro\nfloat time constant and eliminates the multiple pulsing.\nCOMPENSATED\nTC\n\ntLSG StGK\n\nP.T.

In addition, to further reduce capacitance to\nground and minimize switching transients, the input transformer in the supply is\ndesigned for minimum interwinding capacitance.\nThe 9600 Hz excitation is used for the 8v power supply because of its availability\nin the module, simplifying the module wiring interface. Because of the good regulation\nof the 9600 Hz supply and the relatively high frequency, the size of the transformer\nand the filter components in the supply can be small. The schematic Dwg.

The networks\' function is to tune the coil\nso that minimum SF deviation with rate is achieved. The unit also contains a trim\nresistor which is in series with the "dummy" torquer mounted on the gyro. The\nused to adjust the "dummy" torquer resistance to the actual dc\n\ntrim resistor is\n\nresistance of the torquer.\n\nThis "dummy" torquer is a non-inductive heater whose\nresistance is approximately equal to the actual torquer dc resistance. The heater\nis located on the gyro end mount in the module at the torqter end of the gyro.\nWhenno torquer current is needed, the "dummy" is energized by the PTE torque-no\ntorque logic (Fig. 3.2.15). This transfer provides a constant loai to the current\nsource. It also provides a thermal input to the gyro equivalent to that seen by the\ngyro when torquing is commanded.\nthe\n\ngyro by delivering\n\nconstant\n\nThis action minimizes thermal transients in\n\npower\n\nto the\n\ngyro regardless of the torquing\n\nrequirements.\n\nGYRO\n\nPTE\n\nRC NETWORK\nI\nI\nI\n- i\n\nTRIM\nI\n\nGYRO\nTORQUER\nCOIL\n\nGYRO\nDUMMY\nTORQUER\n\nSF\n\nFig. 3. 2. 19 Gyro Module RC Network\n\n73\n\n6.\n\nBandpass Preamplifier\nThis amplifier provides the necessary gain to raise the level of the gyro SG\n\nerror signal to be compatible with the PTE input circuit.\nfiltering\n\nto\n\nexcitation.\n\nminimize\n\nthe\n\nunwanted\n\nAn adjustment is\n\nHz pickup\n\n800\n\nIt also provides bandpass\n\ninduced by the gyro wheel\n\nprovided in the unit to correct the phasing of the SG\n\nsignal so that it matches the timing of the interrogate pulse (see Fig. 3.2.13).\n\nThe\n\nschematic Dwg. No. is 2304030.\n\n7.\n\nTemperature Controller\nThe function of this unit is to minimize temperature sensitive gyro drift terms\n\nby maintaining the gyro temperature constant within \xc2\xb1 0.10F over a range of ambient\ntemperatures,\n\nwheel power\n\nvariations,\n\nand other\n\nthermal\n\ndisturbances.\n\nThe\n\ncontroller contains two legs of a dc resistance bridge; the other two legs being\ntemperature sensitive resistors located in the gyro.\noperating temperature\n\n(1320F) of the gyro.\n\nThe bridge is balanced at the\n\nAny deviation from this temperature\n\nunbalances the bridge and generates an error voltage.\n\nThis error is then amplified\n\nby a low level, high gain, dc, integrated circuit operational amplifier. This amplifier\ncontains an integrated circuit temperature control loop which keeps the dc amplifier\ncircuit at constant temperature in order to minimize dc drift due to temperature\nvariations within the amplifier.\n\nThis amplifier then drives another amplifier which\n\ndrives power output transistors which, in turn, deliver power to a heater located\non the gyro (See Fig. 3.2.20).\n\nThe power transistors are assembled into the gyro\n\nend mounts so that the power dissipated in the power transistor is transferred to\nthe gyro.\n\nSince the controller is essentially a series dc proportional regulator,\n\nthe sum of the power dissipated in the transistor and the power dissipated in the\ngyro heaters is linearly proportional to the gyro heater current. This mechanization\nis in contrast to the usual situation where the power transistor dissipation is not\npart of the control heat (not located at the gyro) so that gyro thermal control is\nonly by heater power which is proportional to the square of the heater current.\nThis linear operation simplifies the dynamic compensation of the control loop and\nprovides for maximum thermal efficiency of the controller output circuitry. Dynamic\nloop compensation is\n\nachieved by the use of a series of RC networks connected\n\nbetween the emitter of the TG end mount power transistor and the input to the high\ngain amplifier.\n\nThe time constant and gain of the RC network are chosen so as to\n\nstabilize the control loop which would otherwise be unstable due to the high loop\ngain and thethermal lags betweenthe heater and sensor. The network also optimizes\nthe transient response to thermal disturbances. The schematic Dwg.

This output is a Hi/Fail indication and is transmitted\nto the failure logic.\nThe Lo/Fail circuit, Fig. 3.3.9, works in a manner similar to the Hi/Fail\ncircuit.\n\nIn this case the multivibrator frequency is set at a frequency lower than\n\nthe clock frequency by an RC network.\n\nThe clock pulses, occurring at a rate faster\n\nthanthe 9601 frequency, keep the gate triggeredON producing a steady state logical\n"1"\n\nat the output.\n\nIf the clock frequency drops below the multivibrator frequency\n\nthe output returns to logical "0" at the end of its pulse width before being triggered\nto logical "1" by the clock.

The pulse driver configuration\nis shown in Fig. 3.3.15. Each signal originates at an SN 5401 gate driving dual\ntransformer coupled lines resulting in redundantly bussed signals (signals on either\nBus A or Bus B).

This arrangement permits a failure of the SN\n5401 gate to cause failure of the succeeding scaler sections. This failure is detected\nby a simple end-of-counter failure detection circuit which will be described later.\nNo further test circuits are required for this sequence of signals. The synchronizing\npulses derived by these techniques are approximately 400 nanoseconds wide.\n2.\n\nSelf-Test of Scaler\nEach scaler has a main scaler that divides down to 200 pps.\n\nscaler, the 38. 4 kpps,\n\n9. 6 kpps and 200 pps output signals are derived by conventional\n\ncountdown techniques driven as described above.\nis\n\nIn the main\n\nThe lowest frequency,\n\n200 pps,\n\nfed to a Hi/Lo retriggerable one shot circuit similar to that described for the\n\nHi/Lo monitor.\n\nA failure in an internal gate or flip flop of a synchronous scaler\n\nwill result in locking the Enable of a next succeeding state change to either logical\none (1)\n\nor zero (0)\n\nFor the first state (1) the result will be an increase in the\n\nlowest frequency equal to 2 N\n\nwhere 1 < N < M and M is the highest number of\n\nflip-flops sharing one clock frequency.\ncondition effectively.\n\nThe Hi/Fail test circuit will reveal this\n\nFor the second state (0) the lowest scaler frequency becomes\n\nzero which is detected in the Lo / Fail circuit previously described. Thus, the operation\nof the main scaler is tested by applying the 200 pps signal to one Hi/Fail and one\nLo/Fail circuit.\nThe 115.2 kpps signal is derived from a subscaler linked synchronously with\nthe main scaler.\n\nSelf-test is by means of a separate Hi/Lo test section.\n\noutputs of these test sections are logically "OR"\n\nThe\n\nconnected to one "FAIL" gate for\n\nthe scaler.\n\nThe fault tolerance capabilities and test provisions for the two line drivers\nwhich pass signals from the scaler to six, separate interrogate and the six separate\nswitch pulse line drivers are shown schematically in Fig, 3. 3.16.

The liquid-to-air HX package is mounted\non the test table, making liquid slip rings unnecessary.\nEach inertial sensor module has its individual temperature controller, and\nthe mounting provisions for each module provide both alignment and thermal path\ncontrol (thermal resistance). Controlling the heat flow by means of high thermal\nresistance minimizes thermal coupling between the inertial sensor modules and\nreduces the control power requirement.\n\nCoarse temperature control of some of\n\nthe inertial sensor, module mounted, electronics circuits is achieved as a by-product\nof the inertial sensor temperature control by means of module thermal resistance\ndesign.\n\nMaximum\n\nthermal\n\nresistance\n\nto ambient\n\nas required\n\nin a spacecraft\n\nenvironment would be achieved by an insulating cover (thermal shroud) for the RIP.\nThe mounting pad materials for the gyro and accelerometer modules were\nselected tomake the thermal impedances betweenmodules and 7-frame compatible;\ni.e. both gyro and accelerometer modules operate at the same percentage of maximum\ncontrol power of their individual temperature controller circuit.\nThe EA is\nforced-air cooled to meet laboratory test needs.\n\nFor spacecraft use it could be\n\nconnected to the liquid cooling loop or mounted on a heat-sinked structure, depending\non the allowable spacecraft temperature range.\nMechanically the thermal\ndifferent control areas, namely:\n\ndesign can be considered\n\nas consisting of four\n\nRIP, EA, gyro module and accelerometer module.\n\n3.4.3 System Thermal Design Concept\nIndividual\n\ntemperature control for each IC is not only consistent with the\n\nredundant implementation but allows for unsymmetrical thermal changes.\n\nExamples\nof these unsymmetrical changes are position sensitivity, module mounting thermal\nresistance variations, single component wheel power variation and random inputs\nsuch as torque commands.\nIn order to provide maximum isolation of the controlled element, the heaters\nare located at the IC mounting surfaces within the modules. The liquid cooling\nloop to the RIP coldplate develops a reasonably constant thermal sink. The RIP\ncoldplate mounts to the back of the RIP\n\n7-frame in the central well area.\n\nHold\ndown screws accessible from the front of the RIP allow attachment of the coldplate\n\n101\n\ni;:;ii i~~~- i i:-i:Iii::: ::\n:\'\n_il\n\ni:: ::\n\nFwtw\nCO\n\n\' HeatE\n\nx\n\nchanger\n\nAdontinenta\nCoolant\nHose\nReturnle Meter\n\nSFlow\n\n-o\nlteLqi/i\nS :- :iPuhiiiiiiiiii\n\nMotor\n\nMffinFan\n~GldSal:\n\nfrom the front. A gasket spacer between the coldplate and the RIP allows adjustment\nof the thermal resistance between the\n\nw-frame and coldplate.\n\nUse of a coolant loop provides the capability to regulate the amount of heat\nwhich\n\nis\n\ntransferred\n\nfrom the u-frame to the coldplate\n\n(Fig.\n\n3.2.7).\n\nCoolant\n\ntemperature and flow rate may be adjusted to hold the u-frame at a nearly isothermal\ntemperature, suitably lower than the inertial sensor control point.\nof the thermal resistance from the\n\nSuch adjustment\n\nn-frame to the heat-sink can be accomplished\n\nto compensate for environmental conditions or system operating mode.\n\nThus, in\n\nthe standby mode, a high thermal resistance would minimize the power required to\nkeep the\nwould\n\n-frame at temperature.\n\nIn the operate mode a lower thermal resistance\n\nkeep the instruments within the allowable controller temperature.\n\nregulation capability was not instrumented\n\nin\n\nthe\n\nSIRU\n\nsystem\n\nfor\n\nThis\n\nlaboratory\n\noperation.\nThe design of the coolant loop for laboratory operation of the system was\nbased on operation at 70 \xc2\xb1 50 F ambient temperature to avoid the use of a refrigeration\nunit.\n\nDesign goals were achieved by reaching a compromise in coolant flow rate\n\nand coldplate gasket width and material as discussed below.\nA low coolant flow rate reduces\n\nw-frame to module temperature differences\n\n(gradients) for the gyro modules (which need more critical temperature control) at\nthe expense of higher temperature\n\ngradients for the accelerometer modules.\n\nTo\n\nmaintain the same coldplate transfer, a low flow rate also requires a lower coolant\ninlet temperature.\n\nNarrower gasket width results in lower\n\nw-frame temperature\n\ndifferences for both type of modules, but also at the expense of lower coolant inlet\ntemperature requirements.\n\nA\n\ngasket made of aluminum\n\nhas a\n\nlower thermal\n\nresistance than one of titanium, offering the possibility of a higher coolant inlet\ntemperature. These variables were optimized in the SIRU system by a small increase\nin the coolant flow rate, utilizing a gasket of 0.5 inch wide aluminum and accepting\na slight increase in the\n\nr-frame temperature gradients.\n\nA forced-air cooled n-frame had been considered, but it required too much\nspace and blower power, and temperature control sensitivity was unsatisfactory.\nFor spacecraft operation, with a 450 F coolant supply, as specified in Apollo,\nan adaptive regenerative HX could be used for u-frame temperature control. The\nlower coolant temperature supply would, otherwise, dictate even higher inertial sensor\nthermal isolation to avoid excessive control power.\n\n103\n\nOptimum thermal performance\n\nwould be attained by using a regenerative HX and a thermal control by-pass valve\noperating as a function of gyro module temperature control power. The regenerative\nHX would interface with the spacecraft environmental control system with hot and\ncold liquid mixing occurring at the n-frame coldplate inlet.\n\nOther methods for\n\ncontrolling the coolant loop in the spacecraft environment are also feasible.\nTo attain the fine temperature control\n\nneeded\n\ncelerometers, proportional control loops are used.\n\nfor both the gyros and ac-\n\nThe control circuit is novel in\n\nthat the control power is a linear function of control current.\ndc control loops typically corresponds to 12 R.\n\nThe control power in\n\nIn the SIRU system linear control\n\nis achieved by mounting the output power transistors directly on the IC mounting\nblock along with the control heaters.\n\nThe control power then becomes a function of\n\nboth the applied heater power and the power dissipated in the transistor.\n\nSince the\n\nmajor portion of the controller power is dissipated in the transistor the resulting\ncontrol is both linear and efficient.\nA ternary torque loop is used to drive the inertial instruments.\n\nIn the zero\n\ntorque mode, the torquing current is directed to a "dummy" heater, equal in resistance\nThis arrangement results\n\nto the torquer, located at the TG end of the instrument.\n\nin a constant power input to the TG end of the instrument, thereby, reducing thermal\ngradients on the r-frame.\n\nEach gyro or accelerometer module is thermally and\n\nmechanically interchangeable.\nThe use of thermoelectric elements instead of heaters was considered with\nthe objective of reducing control power.\n\nThe concept was not implemented in the\n\nSIRU development model to avoid the impact of new technology for a non-essential\npurpose.\n\nThermoelectrics\n\nshould\n\nbe\n\nreconsidered\n\nin\n\nfuture designs.\n\nSince\n\nthermoelectrics are bi-polar heat pump devices, the control point can be set at\nzero control power.\n\nFor a heater system, zero control power means the system\n\nhas just lost control.\n3.4.4 Thermal Design of the Accelerometer Module\nThe thermal design of the accelerometer module was based on a multinodal\nthermal network, Fig. 3.4.4, and thermal model test analysis.\nindicated what changes should be made to the first-cut design.\n\nThe test results\n\nThermal resistance\n\nbetween control heater and mounting block was too high, while the thermal resistance\nbetween accelerometer and block was too low for good control action and minimal\ntemperature variation at the block (see Fig. 3.2.4).\n\nOne of the effects of these\n\ncombinations was that the temperature variation at the PTE module mounted to the\nside of the block was unacceptable.\n\n104\n\n1.30\nPIP\n3.744\n2.90\n10.32\n\nControl\nHeater\n\nAmbient\n\n6.206\n\n40. 00\n\nBlock\n\nCover\n3.289\n2.961\n\nBase\n\n0. 15\n\n0.302\n\nPI-FRAME\nFig. 3. 4. 4 SIRU PIP Module Thermal Model Network.\nRecommendations resulting from these tests and incorporated into the final\ndesign were:\na)\n\nTo decrease the control heater-to-block thermal resistance by changing\nthe ring material from stainless steel to aluminum\n\nb)\n\nTo increase the accelerometer-to-block thermal resistance by increasing\nthe clearance between the accelerometer body and block cavity\n\nc)\n\nTo increase the block-to-base thermal resistance by the use of Micalex\nwashers instead of titanium under the mounting screws\n\nd)\n\nTo use an aluminum accelerometer mounting block\n\nA nodal network representation of the accelerometer module thermal model\nas shown in Fig. 3.4.4 identifies the resistance values in units of oF/watt.

Total dissipation is 5.7 watts excluding the control power\n0\nof 2.9 watts. The resistancevalue of 40.0 F/watt from cover to ambient is a predicted\nvalue based on the assumption that a thermal jacket having 0.5 inch thick insulation\nwill be provided for the RIP in the spacecraft. If this jacket is not present, this\n0\nresistance value could be as low as about 8.0 F/watt.\nThe tested prototype accelerometer module can be represented in its simplest\nform by a nodal network of three equivalent resistors. Equivalent resistance for a\n5.6 watt dissipation from control point to i-frame equals 90 F/watt (including\n1.20F/watt through greased pads). Equivalent resistance for 2.9 watt maximum\ncontrol power from control point to w-frame equals 13.00 F/watt. Equivalent\nresistance from control point toambient equals 12.00 F/watt without n-frame cover\nand 40.0 0 F/watt with 1/2 inch insulated\n\nn-frame cover.\n\nFinal thermal performance data shows that with bare modules (no insulated\ni-frame cover) in a laboratory ambient of 75 F, the accelerometer modules will\nstay within temperature control range (0-100% control power) over a I-frame\n0\ntemperature range of approximately 920F to 125 F. In a spacecraft ambient of 600\nF to 110 0 F, the accelerometer module will maintain temperature control over a\nI-frame temperature range from 77 F to 103oF if a 1/2 inch insulated i-frame\ncover is used (see Fig. 3.4.5). Temperature sensitive electronic modules in the\naccelerometer module, such as the PTE, will experience temperature excursions\nwhich are approximately 50% of the w-frame temperature excursions (see Fig. 3.4.6).\nThe detailed description of the accelerometer temperature control circuit is\npresented in Volume IV.\nA separate GSE heater and sensor assembly is mounted on the accelerometer\nalignment block. This heater and temperature sensor are used for GSE temperature\n0\ncontrol of the accelerometer module at 125 F, when the SIRU system is in the standby\nmode. A fourth accelerometer body wrap-around sensor is used in conjunction\nwith the GSE to monitor accelerometer temperature at all times.

Ambient cooling air (13 cfm) is drawn through\nthe extruded aluminum finned plate and cover by a muffin fan operating on 115 vac,\n60 cycle power. The HX surfaces are machined and greased for improved thermal\nconductance.\n\nSince the EA is air cooled from the module side, removal of the NAFI modules\nrequires the prior removal of the heat exchanger above that row of modules.\n\nThe\n\n40/5v power supplies, on the other hand, can be removed unimpeded from the module\nside.\n\nAt the 700F room temperature, the maximum NAFI module frame temperature\nis\n\n930F.\n\nUnder these conditions the semiconductor junction temperatures inside\n\nthe modules remain below the 105\nequipment in the Apollo program.\n\n0\n\nC reliability limit imposed on high reliability\nThe power supplies, however, operate slightly\n\nabove (1200C) these established limits.\n\nThermal resistance between NAFI modules\n\nand the structure is kept low by use of special clips (Bircher).\ndissipate the most heat are provided with more clips per module.\n\nModules which\n\nThermal analysis\n\nshows that temperature gradients along any row of NAFI modules is less than 20F.\nTotal power dissipated in the EA is 124 watts, 40 watts of which is at the 40/5v\npower supplies.\n3.5\n\nTable 3.3.4 shows the distribution of power dissipation in the EA.\n\nDocumentation\n\nThe essential documentation of the RIP is contained in Fig. 3.5.1 which provides\na simplified family tree showing the principal assembly and schematic drawings.\nTable 3.5.1 shows an index of the drawings identified with each of the electronic\nmodules incorporated in the SIRU EA.\nA review of the electrical and hardware items currently incorporated in SIRU\nshows that of approximately 350 items identified in the documentation by commercial\ndesignation, 250 are already qualified under military specifications or could readily\nbe qualified by IDEP, previous military application or authenticated test data. Of\nthe remainder, 50 items of miscellaneous hardware require some degree of effort\nto identify completely.\n\nIt is estimated that one half of these (25 items) will turn\nout to be military specification equivalents. The remainder, approximately\n75 items,\nrequire some degree of qualification action in order to meet a strict requirement\nfor qualified parts selection.\n\n116\n\nSINU\n2300001\nPi Frame Assy\nS2300002\n\nr Harness\nnot drawn\n\nEectronics\n2304400\n\n\'c\n\nI\nPi Base Assy\n2300003\n\nInsert Ball\n2300091\n\nGyro Module\n2300004\nICD\n2300096\n\n.\n\nPIPA Module\n2300005\nICD\n2300098\n\nIL_\n\nNorm\n1J\n2304094Bd\nJ\n23009\nPwr Tstr\n2304307\n\nB Harness\nnot drawn\nBase Plate\n\nJY~ar\n\n2300029\nPower Supply\n\nI\n\nnot drawn\nGyro Elec.\n\nC Harness\nnot drawn\n\n2304130\nBase Plate\n2304145\n\n2300073\n-e Cover s\nAssy s-]2304142\n2300102\nHarness\n\nRetainer\n2304142\nRetainer\n2304140\n\nPwr Supply\n2304004\n304004\n\nnot drawn\nConnector\n\nTempCnt\nTemp Cont\n2304061\n\n2300099\n16 PM PIP\n\nSide Plate\n230413\n\nGEM\nGEM\n\n2622000\nPEM\n2640558\n\nKeying Strips\n2304170\n2304170\n2304171\n2304172\n2304173\n2304174\n\nnot drawn\nA Harness\nnot drawn\n\nBase Frame\n\n2300014\nGSE Heating\n\n2300032\nrGyro\n12303000\n\nSub-Assy\n2304121\n\nHousing\n\nTG End Mount\n2300031\njSG End Mount\n\nPi Frame Braz\n& Mach Assy\n2300049\n\nConnector\n2300072\n\n2304220\nBP Preamp\n2304065\n\nRC Network\nCover Assy\nRN o\n2304254\n2300101\n2\nInterpol\nCon\nConnector nctornot drawn\nInterpo.\n2300099\nnot drawn\nQuad Adj ]\nNetwork\n\nFig. 3. 5. 1\n\nPower Supply\n2304017\nLine Driver\n2304056\nTemp Cont\n2304021\nThermo\n2300084\n\nSIRU Family Tree\n\n_ Retainer\n2304141\n2304141\n\nI\'\n\nI\nModules\nsee Table 3.5. 1\n\nTable 3.5. 1 Electronic\n\nAssembly Documentation Index\n\nASSEMBLY NO.\n\nSCHEM.\n\nDC AXIS SUPPLY\n\n2304016\n\n2304005\n\nDC AXIS SUPPLY DRIVER\n\n2304011\n\n2304006\n\nFUSE & DIODE\n\n2304039\n\n2304034\n\nLOGIC TRANSFER HIILO MONITOR\n\n2304051\n\n2304031\n\nINTERROGATOR & SW LINE DRIVER\n\n2304070\n\n2304066\n\nEXTERNAL CLOCK DR\n\n2304074\n\n2304071\n\n5 VDC PULSE DR\n\n2304079\n\n2304067\n\n4015 V DC SUPPLY\n\n2304086\n\n2304033\n\nTIMING & FUSE MOD\n\n2304091\n\n2304082\n\n800 HZ WHEEL SUPPLY PWR AMP SECT II\n\n2304097\n\n2304098\n\n9600 HZ SUSPENSION SUPPLY SECT II\n\n2304105\n\n2304095\n\n800 HZ WHEEL SUPPLY PWR AMP SECT IlVI\n\n2304108\n\n2304250\n2304251\n\n9600 HZ SUSPENSION SUPPLY SECT IV\n\n2304112\n\n2304096\n\n9600 HZ SUSPENSION SUPPLY SECT II\n\n2304114\n\n2304113\n\nSCALER I\n\n2304236\n\n2304204\n\nSCALER 2\n\n2304237\n\n2304205\n\nSCALER 3\n\n2304238\n\n2304206\n\nSCALER 4\n\n2304239\n\n2304207\n\nSCALER 5\n\n2304240\n\n2304208\n\n900 HZ SECT I , 800 HZ SECT III\n\n2304241\n\n2304153\n\n800 HZ SECT IV\n\n2304242\n\n2304150\n\n800 HZ WHEEL SUPPLY PWR SECT V\n\n2304255\n\n2304106\n\nCLOCK OSCILLATOR\n\n2304308\n\nMODULE TITLE\n\n.\n\n118\n\n4.0\n\nComputation Facility and SIRU Software\nThe SIRU system was designed with an integral, dedicated computer in mind.\n\nThe computer and its peripheral equipment were sized to support development and\ncheckout including test software, and to carry out the full regime SIRU operational\nsoftware.\n\nThis chapter discusses the computational facility dedicated to the SIRU\n\nsystem, the test and operational software and the data handling and analysis programs\nwritten for this system.\n4.1\n\nSIRU Computation Facility\nA computer facility was assembled\n\nto support, initially, the development,\n\ncheckout and testing of the SIRU system including the development of SIRU software\nand software for the originally planned DCA.\nthe operational system.\n\nThis same facility later supported\n\nMajor components of the facility are listed in Table 4.1.1.\n\nThe general purpose computer is a commercial DDP-516 manufactured by\nHoneywell.\n\nIt is a 16-bit machine with a memory cycle time of 0.96 microsecond\n\nand includes the high-speed arithmetic package as well as 16,384 words of core\nmemory.\n\nThe Honeywell\n\nDDP-516\n\nis compatible with current state-of-the-art\n\nairborne flight computers and as such serves as an excellent design demonstration\nand software verification vehicle.\n\nThe computer has hardware interrupt and its\n\nstructure incorporates direct, indirect and indexed addressing.\nrelatively fast, its add time is\n\nThe DDP-516 is\n\n1.92 microseconds and the high-speed arithmetic\n\npackage features a single precision multiply (5.82 microseconds) and divide (10.5\nmicroseconds maximum) and double precision add and subtract (2.88 microseconds).\nThe computer is compatible with the real-time processing requirements of the SIRU\nsystem running at a\n\n100\n\nupdate/second\n\nrate.\n\nIn addition,\n\nthe availability of a\n\nsophisticated disc operating system (DOS) developed for this particular computer\nby NASA/ERC enables operation with a large, moving head disc storage unit with\nbackup capability. This combination of memory and versatile interactive capability\nprovided a viable software development facility.\nA detailed description of the computer peripherals listed in Table 4.1.1 as\npart of the Computation Facility is presented as follows.\n\n119\n\nTable 4. 1. 1\nMajor Components of the SIRU Computation Facility\nEquipment Name\n\nIdentification\n\nComputer\n\nHoneywell DDP-516\n\nDisc Drives\n\nCDC 9433\n\nTeletype\n\nASR-35\n\nCRT Display\n\nSanders 720\n\nMagnetic Tape I/O\n\nDigistore W1-001\n\nPaper Tape I/O\n\nRemex\n\nDedicated Data Link to IBM 360/75\n\nBell 201A Data Phone\n\nTest Table Interface\n\nWayne George Encoder\n\nWith the availability of DOS, a standard Honeywell disc control unit was added\nto the DDP-516. Two CDC 9433 drives are used, each capable of storing about 34\nmillion words of data on line.\n\nThe discs were used for the storage of: operational\nsoftware programs, system calibration and data reduction programs and system\ntest data for subsequent processing and error analysis. Programs were developed\nto "back-up" a disc by copying it on the second drive.\nThus, a file copy of the\ncurrent programs and data was always available.\nUser oriented\n\ninput/output\n\n(I/O) capability is available either through the\nASR-35 teletype unit or the Sanders 720 CRT. The CRT was procured to facilitate\nsoftware development and for use as a real-time display. In all of the operational\nsoftware described below in Section 4.2 (and in greater detail in Volume III), provision\nis made for real-time display of the system status.\nOther I/O devices comprise a high speed Remex optical paper tape reader, a\nDigistore magnetic tape deck and a dedicated data phone link to MIT/CSDL\'s\nIBM\n360/75 computer. A paper tape punch is available on the teletype, and all other\nforms of output (card decks, magnetic tapes, disc packs, etc.) are available\nat the\nIBM 360/75 through the data phone link. Initially, SIRU was dependent upon Digistore\ntape to transfer data to the IBM 360/75 complex, but the data\nphone link was\nincorporated midway through the program.\nA final interface links the computer to the SIRU system and its test table.\nThis interface contains an up-down counter for each inertial component,\ntwo\ninterrogate pulse counters and a test table rotary axis readout.

Previous chapters in this volume\nThe\nhave described the analytical theory and implementation of the software.\nfollowing material summarizes the software description contained in Volume III.\nAll the operational software for the SIRU test system was developed on the DDP-516\ncomputer facility, while complementary data analysis, data plotting and simulation\nprograms were prepared for the IBM 360/75.\nThis\n\ndevelopment\n\nincluded\n\nthe\n\nhardware\n\ncheckout\n\nsoftware,\n\nthe\n\nsystem\n\ncalibration and calculation programs, software development tools e.g., text editor\nand CRT display drivers, and an assembler for the DCA. A DCA self-test program\nwas developed using the text editor and the DCA assembler.\n4.3.1 Static Calibration Tests\nSIRU performance is evaluated by comparison of system data with external\nreferences. The comparison is accomplished through the use of two parallel sets\nsoftware and an array of analysis,\nA\nsimulation and comparison programs available on MIT/CSDL\'s IBM 360/75.\n\nof computer\n\nprograms, the\n\nSIRU DDP-516\n\ndedicated link between the two computers facilitates the almost immediate evaluation\nof the SIRU real-time performance. The more important programs for each computer\nare explained in this section.\nThe simplest operating mode of the SIRU system is "static calibration" testing.\nGiven the deterministic models of the ICs, it has been shown that a six position\ntest (see Table 4.3.1) yields data necessary and sufficient to isolate and compute\n\n124\n\nthe static error parameters listed in Table 4.3.2. A DDP-516 program, STLOOP,\nused in each position, serves to collect instrument output in the form of elapsed\ntime and torque pulse count for each of the twelve instruments.\n\nThis data set is\n\nindexed serially by test position and date, and stored on the disc. In the calibration\nsequence, STLOOP is run in each of the six positions.\n\nFig. 4.3.1 illustrates the\n\nengineering display.

Several versions of a MAC 360 program,\nICSASTAB, are resident there. These programs process the raw data into engineering\nunits, subject it to statistical analysis and produce printed and plotted records of\nthe performance stability of the twelve inertial components.\nThis procedure is\nroutinely followed and a substantial body of data is available to confirm system\nperformance levels. Figure 4.3.2, for instance, graphically displays the stability\nof one gyro over a weekend run.\n\nThe mean output represents a component of earth\n\nrate plus the gyro drift; the standard deviation of the data indicates the corresponding\nperformance.\n\n284\n-284\n\n.\n\nGYRO F\nMEAN = -0288.346\n\nMERU(4. 33/HR)\nSIGMA = 0 124 MERU(. 00186\xc2\xb0/HI)\nDATE:\n08 JA 70; POS: 1\n\n-288\nz\n\n3\n\n-292\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\nFig. 4. 3. 2 SIRU Gyro Stability\n\nThe user may, alternatively, specify earlier data sets by serial number.\nGyro misalignment and SF calibration requires a dynamic test, which is described\nlater.\n\n127\n\nGyro scale factor (SF) error and misalignments can be determined only through\ndynamic tests as described below.\n4.3.2 Dynamic Calibration Tests\nCertain gyro parameters (SF error, misalignments about Spin Axis (SA) and\nOutput Axis (OA), anisoinertia) are determined from dynamic calibration tests (test\nprogram JIMK).

Thus this program provides a flexible tool\nfor the analysis of SIRU system performance from a variety of tests. Static, constant\nslew and oscillatory tests have been processed, and show good agreement between\nmeasured (SIRU) and computed ("perfect") performance.\n\n132\n\n5.0\n\nSIRU Reliability Appraisal\n\n5.1\n\nObserved Operational Reliability\n\nTable 5.1.1 presents a summary of the SIRU system hardware reliability over\nthe period beginning 27 January, 1970 and ending 19 November, 1971.\n\nDuring this\n\nperiod, the SIRU system was operated for 14,600 hours with a total of 71,000 gyro\nmodule operating hours and 88,000 accelerometer\nsimultaneous failures occurred.\n\nmodule operating hours.\n\nNo\n\nThere were two gyro failures (January, 1971 and\n\nMarch, 1971) and one gyro module PTE failure (April, 1971). One of the gyro failures\nwas a gas bearing wheel non-start after 2811 wheel hours of operation and 1745\nwheel start/stop cycles.\n\nThe other gyro evidenced intermittent float hangups after\n\n5017 wheel hours of operation and 1914 wheel start/stop cycles.\n\nThe PTE failure\n\nwas due to a marginal solder joint (that degraded with time) at one of the scale\nfactor (SF) resistor terminals.\n\nAs a workmanship failure, it does not reflect on\n\nthe PTE reliability as determined by the reliability of the PTE electronic components.\nIt does, however, reflect a potential hazard that is not easily screened and represents\na continuing reliability hazard to the system population.\nTable 5. 1. 1 SIRU System Hardware Reliability\n\nData from 1/27 /70 to 11/19/71\n\nComponent Failures\n\nOperatingHours\n\nSystemFailures\n\n3\n\n14,600\n\n0\n\nNo. of\nFailures\n\nMTBF\nMeasured\n90% Conf\n\nOperating Hours\n"Actual"\' Req\'d*\n\nGyro\n\n2\n\n35,500\n\n13,400\n\n71,000\n\n185,000\n\nPTE\n\n1\n\n159,000\n\n40,700\n\n159,000\n\n620,000\n\nAccelerometer\n\n0\n\n88, 000\n\n38, 300\n\n88,000 202,000\n\nOperating Hours required to demonstrate measured MTBF with 90% confidence\n\nTable 5.1.2 is a tabulation of estimates of failure rates for SIRU hardware\ncomponents.\n\nThe failure rates for the electronics were estimated using a component\n\nparts count of each circuit with electronic component failure rates based upon Apollo\nexperience.\n\nThe conservative failure rate of 75 x 10 - 6 failures/hr shown in the\n\n133\n\ngyro reliability range (Table 5.1.2) reflects the 13,400 hour MTBF value (at the\nThe measured MTBF of 35,500 hours for\n\n90% confidence level) from Table 5.1.1.\n\nthe gyros (Table 5.1.1) was used to determine the lower failure rate value of 28 x\n10\n\n- 6\n\nfor the gyro shownin Table 5.1.2.\n\n(This estimate is also conservative because\n\nin this gyro population the wheel start problem was a known design deficiency that\nwas subsequently resolved by a bearing material change).\n\nThe failure rates shown\n\nfor the accelerometer modules are conservative and were obtained by assuming\nthat one failure did occur in the 88,000 hours of operation even though there were\nactuallyno failures during this period.\n\nThe lower accelerometer failure rate given\n\nin Table 5.1.2 (11.4 x x 16 corresponds toan assumed one failure in 88,000 hours.\n10-6),\nThe\n\npessimistic accelerometer failure rate (26 x 10 -\n\n6\n\n) corresponds to the 90%\n\nconfidence MTBF of 38,300 hours shown in Table 5.1.1.\nTable 5 1. 2\n\nSIRU Failure Rate Estimates\n\nFailure Rate,X\n(Failures per Hour)\n\nGyro Module:\n\n28-100 x 10 -\n\nGyro PTE, Interpolator & 8v Supply\n\n6\n\n15 x 10 -\n\nGyro\n\n6\n\n3 X 10\n11 x 10\n\nTemperature Control\nWheel Supply\nNet Gyro Module Each Axis = X1\n\n- 6\n- 6\n\n57-129 x 10 -\n\n6\n\nAccelerometer Module:\n11.4-50 x 10- 6\n\nPIP\n\n12 x 10 -\n\nTemperature Control\n\n6\n\n3 x 10 -\n\nPIP PTE 8v Supply\n\n6\n\n26.4-65 x 10\n\nNet PIP Module Each Axis = N2\n\n- 6\n\nElectronics Assembly (6 Axes Support):\n9600 Hz Supply\n\n10 x 10 -\n\nDC Axis Supply\n\n12 x 10\n\n6\n\n- 6\n\n1 x 10 -\n\n6\n\n12 x 10 -\n\nNet Electronics Assembly = X 3\n\n6\n\n23 x 10 -\n\nFuse/Diode Module\n\n6\n\nElectronics Assembly (Dual or Triple Redundant):\n40/5 vdc Supply = X4\n28 vdc Pre-Regulated\n\n12 x 10\n\n= X5\n\n10 x 10 - 6\n\nMultiplexer = X 6\nClock =\n\n- 6\n\n1 x 10 -\n\nScaler = N 8\n\n134\n\n6\n\n10 x 10 -\n\n7\n\n6\n\n5.2\n\nTheoretical Reliability Calculations\n\nVarious SIRU reliability curves (reliability vs. mission time) are presented\nin Figs. 5.2.1 through 5.2.4 using the SIRU reliability criteria given in Table 5.1.3\nfor defining hard and soft failures and the failure rates listed in Table 5.1.2.

The soft fail analyses presented\nhere assume that two failures only are detected and isolated.\n2.\n\nThe SIRU equipment is in uninterrupted operation throughout the mission.\n\nEquations are derived separately for what we termed soft and hard failure\nsystems.\n\nThe term soft failure is defined to encompass performance degradations\n\nwhich can be isolated only by measurement comparisons (voting or FDI algorithms).\nHard failure is used to describe faults which do not require voting for proper isolation.\nIn general, these are catastrophic failures which can be isolated by self-test hardware\n(BITE) or reasonability type software tests.\n\nSIRU reliability equations are derived separately for systems which can tolerate\ndifferent amounts of component failures.\n\nThese two configurations are described\n\nin terms of what failures can be tolerated (Table 5.1.3).\n\nSoft failure systems are\n\nthose in which FDI can isolate failures of only two measurement axes.\ntwo gyro and\n\ntwo accelerometer\n\nmodules can be isolated\n\nautomatically or two\n\nThe reliability analysis in R-747 includes analysis of FDI coverage.\n\n135\n\nThus, up to\n\n1.0EA\nonly\n0.8\n\n0.6\nSIRU IC only\n0.4\nTotal SIRU\nSystem\n0.2 Reference Triad\n0.0\n\n0\n\n1\n2\n\n1\n4\n\ni\n6\n\nI\n10\n\n8\n\n12\n\nFig. 5. 2. 1 SIRU Reliability - Soft Failures 90% Confidence Failure Rates\nfor Gyros and Accelerometers\n\n1.0\nEA only\n0.8\n--SIRU IC only\n0.6\n\nTotal SIRU System\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\nReference Triad\n0.0\n\n0\n\nFig. 5. 2. 2\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\nSIRU Reliability - Hard Failures 90% Confidence Failure Rates\nfor Gyros and Accelerometers\n\n136\n\n1.\n0\nEA only\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\nSIRU IConly\n\n0.4\n\nTotal System\n\n0.2\nReference Triad\n0.0\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\nFig. 5. 2. 3 SIRU Reliability - Soft Failures Experienced Failure Rates\nfor Gyros and Accelerometers\n\n1.0\n\nEA\nonly\n0.8 -\n\nSIRU IC only\nTotal SIRU System\n\n0. 6\n\n0. 4\n\n0.2 -\n\n0.0\n0.0\n\n0\nFig. 5. 2.4\n\nReference Triad\n\n2\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\nI\n\n10\n\n12\n\nSIRU Reliability - Hard Failures Experienced Failure Rates\nfor Gyros and Accelerometers\n\n137\n\nelectronic functional axes can be lost, with operation continuing.

For each functional\naxis three dedicated elements, a dc supply, a 9600 Hz supply and a fuse and diode\nmodule, support both the corresponding\n\ngyro and accelerometer modules.\n\n139\n\nSince\n\nthese electronic elements are not cross strapped, a failure in any of them results\nin the loss of both a gyro and an accelerometer.\n\nThe reliability of the inertial\n\npackage with no axis electronics failure is derived as shown in Eqs. 5.8 through\n5.10.\n\nThe reliability of the axis-dedicated electronics is shown by Eq. 5.3. The\nreliability of the complete inertial package including the axis-dedicated electronics\nfor soft failures is as shown in Eq. 5.11.\nThis expression is conservative for it ignores several cases in which the\nsystem is unaffected by failures which Eq. 5.11 includes. For instance, if a gyro\nfailure occurs followed by the failure of its axis electronics, the electronics failure,\nin effect, is partially forgiven. Another example is shown by a gyro failure followed\nby an axis electronics failure on another axis.

The larger\nsample size of the cooldown data results because all installed instruments are affected\nby a system cooldown whereas remounting affects only individual instruments.\nA comparison of the g-sensitive drift for these two cases shows nearly identical\nperformance; that is, both the spread in delta magnitudes and the calculated rms\nvalues for each term are similar.\nThis is to be expected, as the environmental\nimpact on the instrument is nearly the same in each case (all power off). There is\nno apparent effect from the physical movement of the module during remounting.\nThese g-sensitive\n\ndrift changes across cooldown are a deficiency of the 18 IRIG\nMod B gyro population used in SIRU. An improved instrument, the 18 IRIG Mod D,\nwith a redesigned, integral wheel and gimbal (described in Volume II) has substantially\nreduced this sensitivity. The equivalent performance of the Mod D across cooldowns\nis documented to be on the order of .015 0 /hr.\nThe tabulation of standard deviations (Column 3) for the various terms is\nderived from one to six months of calibration test results chosen to exclude all\ninterposing cooldowns or remounts. This data is considered to be representative\nof the performance across cooldowns expected with the incorporation of the 18 IRIG\nMod D or an equivalent instrument.\nThe SF and alignment stability performance, for all three cases, is very\nrespectable, and the standard deviations are indicative of the stability of the hardware\nand the sensitivity or resolution of the calibration and data reduction process. As\nexplained in subsequent sections, reductions in SF differences across mounting have\nbeen achieved through implementation of hardware modifications, and reductions in\nalignment differences across mounting can be achieved through the use of an optical\ncalibration fixture.\n\n156\n\nSTANDARD\n\nACROSS\n\nACROSS\n\nCOO.LDOIVNS\n\nMOUNTING\n\nRMS= 0. 05\n\nRMS= 0. 06\n\n-. 15\n\n.\n\n5\n\nDEVIATIONS*\n\nRMS\n\n.15\n\n-.15\n\n0.03\n\n.15\n\nNBD ( dogfhr)\n\nRMS\n\n-. 15\n\n0. 06\n\n.15\n\nRMS= 0. 06\n\n-. 15\n\n.15\nADSRA\n\ndeg/hlr\n\n0\n\n.15\ng\n\n)\n\nRMS = 0.04\n\nRMS= 0.08\n\nRMS= 0. 05\n\n-,3\n\nRMS = 0.04\n\n-.\n\n".3\n\n.3\n\n..3\n\nADIA (,deg/hr\'/g)\n\nRATS\n\n0.01\n\nIMS =\n\nFPri m\nS15\n\n,\n\n,\n\nU\n\n.15\n\n-. 15\n\nn\n\nR\n)\nADOA\n\n. 01\n\nn\n.15\n\n(\n\nRMS =0.O5\n\n0\n\n.15\n\nA\'g/r/g )\nNo\n\n1 -\n\nFig. 7. 2. 1 Gyro Drift Performance\n18 IRIG Mod B\n\n157\n\ncoldowns\n\ni month.\n\nor\n\nmotutini\n\nlUs\n\nCOO)LDOWNS\n\nRMS = 0.03\n\n-:L3\n\nb\n\n.Id\n\n-. b\n5\n\n200\n\nRMS\n\n-200\nSCAIAE\n\nMIS\n\n0\n\nRIMS\n\n=\n\n.009\n\n.16\n\n)\n\n22\n\nRIMS\n\n0\n\n10\n\n200\n\nFACTOR (PPM )\n\nRNS\n\n-20\n\n2\n\n200\n\nf)\n\n20\n\n.025\n\n.P\'\nr\n( deg/hr/g\n\nRMS = 30\n\n-200\n\n"D)EVIATION"\n\nRIS\nI\n\nCOMPLIANCE\n\n-20\n\nSTAN)AII)D\n\nAC.ROSS\n\nACISS\nMOUNTING\n\n0\n\n4\n\n20\n\nIMS\n\no\n\n2\n\n20\n\nAJLIGNMENT (SC )\nSNo cooldowns or mounltinlgs\nI - ; m nths.\n\nFig. 7. 2. 2\n\nGyro Compliance, Scale Factor, and Alignment Data\n18 IRIG Mod B\n\n158\n\nTable 7.2.1 shows the average sigma of the drift stability applicable to each\ninstrument in five of the test positions shown in Table 7.2.2.

Comparison of the F-gyro data in the two calibration\npositions illustrates the effect of the major g-sensitive drift terms on the short\nterm performance of the instruments.\nA transient type instrument failure that was observed in system testing is\nillustrated in Fig. 7.2.12. The data was taken on the E- gyro which had been randomly\nidentified as a failure by the SIRU FDI software. This plot confirmed the transient\nfailure phenomena. The unit remained in the system for continued monitoring, and\nadditional random, real "soft" failure events were observed by the FDI software.\nThe plot indicates that the instrument float was restrained at the initiation of the\ntest and experienced an exponential return to the nominal drift level (for that\norientation) over the first six to eight hours of the performance test. The one\nsigma drift value of 0.048 0 /hr and the visible roughness of the point-to-point\nperformance during the remaining fifty hours of the test are indicators of a probable\ncontaminant in the flotation fluid of this instrument.\nunit verified the presence of a contaminant.\n\nSubsequent teardown of this\n\n7.2.2 Day-to-Day Gyro Drift Stability\nThe error in earth rate sensed by each of the system gyros in calibration\nposition 2, on a day-to-day basis, is shown in Figs. 7.2.13 and 7.2.14. The instrument\ncompensation routine (RPOTT) was utilized in these tests so that all the indicated\nrates are free of drifts caused by the nominal calibrated gyro drift, etc. parameters.\nThere were no system cooldowns between the compensation updates.\nFor the entire population over the three month period, we observe from these\ncurves that the maximum data spread was better than 0.090/hr including the sudden\nshift in F-gyro performance and the ramping in the D-gyro. On the average, the\nday-to-day performance is better than 0.015 0 /hr. It should be noted that gyro axes\nA through D in this calibration orientation reflect g-sensitive as well as bias drift\nstabilities since their input axes (IAs) and spin axes (SAs) have sizable components\nalong the g vector.\nBoth the E and F-gyros, whose OAs are vertical, indicate superior repeatable\nday-to-day drift performance, a maximum spread of 0.007 0 /hr (except for the F-gyro\ncalibration shift); this data correlates closely with the overnight stability data (Figs.\n7.2.9 and 7.2.10).

The maximum error with the gyros returned to their original orientation\nis .00920 /hr and the average return accuracy is within 0.0050/hr of the previous\ncalibration position 2 drift summations. This small change is primarily due to the\neffect on the module electronics of the thermal gradients generated within the module\nby "dumping".\n7.2.4 Gyro Scale Factor Linearity\nFigure 7.2.15 is typical of the system\'s positive and negative SF\nover the range of 0.09 rad/sec to 0.38 rad/sec for each of the SIRU gyro\nNote that the plus and minus SF for each gyro is different, and each gyro\'s\nfrom nominal is different. In the system implementation each gyro pulse\n\nlinearity\nmodules.\ndeviation\n\nupdate is\ncorrected by the compensation software for a calibrated deviation from nominal\nfor both its plus and minus SF corresponding to the plus and minus 0.125 rad/sec\ninput.\nThe linearity curves, therefore, reflect the error propagation from the\ncalibrated value. This data was obtained by extending the dynamic calibration\nprogram (JIMK) to include the extra rate inputs required. The maximum spread\nfor all system axes is approximately 50 ppm over the range of test rates.\nIncorporation of the point-slope compensation routine, developed and implemented\non the SPOT program (NASA Contract NAS9- 6823) and reported in Draper Laboratory\nreport R-743, would reduce the SF deviation from the compensated value for these\ninstruments to approximately 10 ppm for input rates up to 1 rad/sec.\nNEGATIVE\n\nS.F.

However, problem\nareas were encountered in the demonstration of transferability of module calibration\ndata between the gyro or accelerometer module normalization test area and in\nsubsequent tests after installation in the system. These problems and corresponding\nrecent test findings that indicate that significant improvements are obtainable are\nreviewed below.\n\n7.3.1 Gyro Module\nA review of the non-g- sensitive (BD) gyro drift across transfer from the gyro\nlaboratory tests to SIRU system tests shows an rms value of .06 degrees per hour.\nRecent efforts have shown this discrepancy to be the result of variations in transistor\nleakage in the pulse torque-to-balance loop H switch dependent upon the residual\npolarity of the switch after torquing. In addition, an error in one of the data reduction\n0\nprograms was uncovered that introduced an uncertainty of approximately 0.12 1hr.\n\nThis error, when combined with the polarity dependency, appears to account for\nthe BD transferability discrepancies.\n\nSpecial system tests conducted since isolation\n\nof these causes have shown a maximum delta BD of .03 degrees per hour between\nthe module and system tests.\n\nThis magnitude can be further reduced in the future\n\nby modifying the calibration and system compensation programs and the computer\ninterface so that the BD compensation will be able to correct for H switch polarity\nleakage\n\ndependency.\n\nThe interface modification would\n\nenable the separate ac-\n\ncumulation of plus and minus AO pulses in each input/output (I/O) iteration.\n\nThis\n\nI/O modification would enable tracking of the individual polarity states of the torquing\ncircuits and permit the implementation of a precise software compensation routine\nfor the dual BD magnitudes.\nTorquer SF shifts (approximately 150 ppm) between module and system tests\nhad been evidenced and were investigated. The SF magnitude was found to be sensitive\nto variations in the level of the 40v excitation between the component test area and\nthe system test area.\n\nTests were conducted with several pulse torque electronics\n\n(PTE) modules in SIRU gyro module #10 to evaluate:\n1)\n\nDC amplifier circuit stability\n\n2)\n\nSF sensitivity to 40v dc supply variations\n\n3)\n\nSF stability\n\n4)\n\nSF linearity\n\n5)\n\nSF sensitivity to RC network tuning\n\n170\n\nModification of the dc amplifier compensation, combined with an increase in\nthe padded resistance of the torquer circuit and resistive tuning of the torquer circuit,\nhas proven successful in desensitizing the SF to variations in the 40v excitation.\nTests with a modified module have demonstrated a significant improvement; the\ndelta SF between module and system tests was reduced to a maximum of 13 ppm.\nTransfer of alignment from laboratory to system mounting has not been fully\nverified, although module alignment repeatability after a system alignment calibration\nand then across a subsequent removal of the module with a cooldown and remounting\nhas been excellent, e.g., an rms of 8 sec and a maximum spread of 20 sec. The\ndemonstration\n\nof absolute transferability of alignment calibration between the\nlaboratory and system has been limited by the non- availability of the precision optical\ncalibration fixture mentioned earlier, (design and assembly of such a gauge was\nnot effected during this program because of fiscal and time constraints) that could\nbe installed in each system n-frame module location. This fixture would enable\nthe determination of the frame pad alignments with respect to the system reference\noptical cube and allow correlation of laboratory and system data. In general, the\nlimited correlated test work devoted to replacement of different modules in the\nsame u-frame slot indicates that the absolute transferability is on the order of 4\nsec.\n7.3.2 Accelerometer Module\nThe variation in accelerometer bias from laboratory test to system test has\nbeen acceptable with an rms value of 21 micro g\'s. The rms value of SF deltas\nfrom laboratory to system operation is 29 ppm. No attempt has been made to reduce\nthis value.\n\nIf an application requirement for a better SF match existed, a task\ncould be initiated to reduce this value to less than 15 ppm rms (conservatively\nestimated). The status of alignment transfer for the accelerometer module is the\nsame as for the gyro module.\n7.4\n\nReal-Time Attitude Error Propagation\n\nTests were conducted with various combinations of zero, one and two instrument\nfailures in static and dynamic environments to determine the error propagation\ncharacteristics of the redundant system. Tests were run with the body axes X, Y,\nand Z vertical and down.\n\nConstant angular rates of 0.4, 4, 10, 16, 26 and 40 0 /sec\n\nin both directions and oscillatory tests of 0.25 Hz,20 0 p-p, 0.50 Hz,15 0 p-p, 3.0 Hz,\n3/40 p-p, and 5.0 Hz,1/4 0 p-p were conducted.\n\n171\n\nThe representative data included in this section are presented as the attitude\nerror between the body (true) and computed (system error) reference frames as a\nfunction of time.\n\nThe predominant dynamic errors appearing in the plots are due\n\nto OA coupling and pseudo-coning.\n\nOther dynamic errors due to SA cross coupling,\n\nanisoinertia, and SF errors are present to a lesser degree.\n\nA large repeatable\n\nerror appearing in these plots is due to a test table encoder error of 80 sec peak\nto peak over one table revolution.\n\n7.4.1 Static Quaternion Attitude Tests\n\nFigure 7.4.1 is typical of the static test results. Even though the test duration\nis only 14 hours, a 24 hour period in the X, Y and Z attitude errors can be observed.\nThe error in the quaternion is quite small, a maximum of 2.5 milliradians in the\n14\n\nhour period\n\nis\n\nshown\n\non the X-axis.\n\nThis\n\ncorresponds\n\nto\n\na\n\ngyro\n\ndrift\n0\n\nmiscompensation and cross coupling error that is equivalent to less than a 0.01 /hr.\n7.4.2 Constant Angular Rate Tests\n\nInputs, during dynamic testing, were impressed about the X, Y, and Z body\naxes.\n\nNo multiple axis testing was included.\nFigures 7.4.2 through 7.4.4 present closure errors for the quaternion attitude\n\nexpressed in terms of SF error for the X (input) axis and equivalent misalignment\nerrors for the axes perpendicular to the rate vector.\nand\n\n7.4.3,\n\nthe\n\nequivalent\n\nsystem\n\nalignment\n\nWith respect to Figs. 7.4.2\n\nuncertainties\n\ncorrespond\n\nto those\n\nout-of-plane angles, which, when operated on by the total angle traverse accumulated\nabout the X- axis, would yield the observed error in the output of the attitude algorithm\naxes that are orthogonal (Y and Z) to the rotational axis X.\n\nAs seen from these\n\nfigures, the equivalent system alignment uncertainty was well bounded, approximately\n10 sec, regardless of the failure combination. It is veryinteresting tonote, however,\nthat when the E and F-gyro axes were failed, i.e., not used in the least-squares\nprocessing matrix for the triad solution, the equivalent misalignment errors were\nessentially nulled.\n\nThis result is indicative of a miscalibration load error in either the E or F\ninstruments.\n\nAnalysis of the equation structure for the four-instrument processing\n\nequations, Appendix A, shows that the F-gyro weighting becomes more dominant\nwith the failure combinations that were exercised.\n\nThe F-axis data in the Y-axis\n\ntriad solution with gyro A and D failed increases in weighting from 0.425 with no\nfailures to 0.638. Similarly, in the Z-axis solution, weighting increases from 0.425\n\n172\n\n4000\nError Quaternion\nWRT Body Frame\nGyro Fails: 0, 0\n\n3000\n<\n\n2000\n1000\nS\n\n0\n\n-1000\n-2000\n\nX\n\n-3000\n~4000\n\nXE\nYE\nYE\nZE\nIII\n2\n\n0\n\n4\n\n6\nTIME\n\nFig. 7.4. 1\n\nII\nI\n8\n(HOURS)\n\nI\n12\n\n10\n\n14-Hour Attitude Test-No Instrument Failures (Cal Pos 2)\n\n(Z-axis attitude errors expressed in equivalent misalignment offset)\n20\nZ\n10\n\n-\n\nE &\nNO\nA &\nA &\n\nF FAILED\nFAILS\nB FAILED\nD FAILED\n\n-i\n\nW~\n\n-10\n\nN -20\n0.4\n4.0\nTABLE (X-AXIS) RATE\n\n40.0\n(o/SEC)\n\nNOTES: 1 Rev. at 0. 4 0 /sec.\n3 Revs. at 4 and 40 0 /sec.\nCompensation Load: NL109 (with OA Coupling Compensation)\nFig. 7.4.2 End-to-End Quaternion Attitude Tests (Cal Pos 2)\n\n173\n\n14\n\n(Y-axi s attitude errors expressed in equivalent misalignment offset)\n20\n\nS-~-\n\nz\n\nE & F FAILED\nNO FAILS\n\n_\n\n-\n\nZ 10\n\nA & B FAILED\nA & D FAILED\n\n0-10\n\n-20\n\n0.4\n4.0\nTABLE (X-AXIS) RATE (\xc2\xb0/SEC)\n\n40.0\n\nNOTES: 1 Rev. at 0. 4 0 /sec.\n3 Revs. at 4 and 40 O/sec.\nCompensation: NL109 (with OA coupling compensation)\n\nFig. 7. 4. 3 End-to-End Quaternion Attitude Tests, Cal Pos 2\n\n100\n\n(Closure errors expressed in PPM, Input rate about X-body axis)\nNO FAILS\nA & B FAILED,\nA & D FAILED\n\nE & F FAILED\n\n50\nX\n-----\n\n..\n\n-\n\nO\n\n50-\n\n,\n\n,\n\n,"\n-100\n0.4\n\n--\n\n=_--\n\nThe errors attributed to the scale\nfactor can also be partially attributed\nto drift compensation errors at\nthe input rate of 0. 4 0 /sec. 100\nppmis equivalent to 10 meru at\n0. 4\xc2\xb0/sec, for the time duration\nof the test.\n4.0\n\n40.0\n\nINPUT RATE (o/SEC)\nNOTES: 1 Rev. at 0. 4 o/sec.\n3 Revs. at 4 and 40 0 /sec.\nCompensation: NL109 (with OA coupling compensation)\n\nFig. 7. 4. 4 End-to-End Quaternion Attitude Tests, Cal Pos 2\n\n174\n\nto 0.607 with gyro A and D failed. Considering the foregoing factors, the relative\ntest time for the different rotational rates and the number of revolutions, it appears\nthat the equivalent system alignment spread in the data shown was primarily due to\nan approximately 0.0301/ drift calibration error in the F-gyro. This is not unexpected\nhr\nsince no special care was taken to obtain a precise calibration load prior to this\ntest sequence. In addition, in the calibration sequence run 14 days after these\nperformance tests, an F-gyro drift performance change from the previous calibration\nof 0.18 0 /hr was observed. The F-gyro instability was eventually traced to a random\nmalfunction in the torquing electronics causing variance type bias performance failure\nphenomena.\nWith regard to Fig. 7.4.4, the equivalent system X-axis SF error was defined\nby comparing the attitude algorithm output X-axis error to the total angle rotation\nof the X-axis. Recall that the compensation algorithm used in SIRU corresponds to\na nominal SF calibration at approximately 0.125 0 /sec. From the test data in the\nfigure, across all of the combinations in the rate region between 4 and 40 0 /sec, the\nequivalent SF error is quite small, a spread of approximately 10 ppm. This\nperformance is\n\nconsistent\n\nwith\n\nthe\n\nSF\n\nlinearity\n\nperformance for individual\nThe roll off at lower rates (0.4 0 l/sec) is also\n\ninstruments shown in Fig. 7.2.15.\nconsistent with data observations on individual instruments and generally relates\nto the uncertainties introduced in the estimation of SF calibration at low rates by\nthe gyro drift calibration uncertainties. The 50 ppm drop across the no failure and\nE and F-gyro failure conditions is therefore consistent with the test calibration\ncondition. The system SF performance is well bounded and reflects the general\nquality of the system gyro torquing performance. Use of a SF linearity compensation\nroutine, as discussed previously, would have yielded improved performance. It is\ninteresting to note that the A and D- gyro failure combination resulted in an increase\nin the equivalent SF error at the low rates of about 40 ppm. Once again, this result\nappears to correspond to the bias compensation error in the F-gyro since the X-axis\ntriad solution weighting does not use the F -gyro when there are no failures. However,\nwith A and D-gyro failed, it is scaled to 0.557.\nFigures 7.4.5 through 7.4.8 present quaternion attitude as a function of time\nwith and without OA coupling compensation and with no failures.\nThe effect of OA coupling errors, resulting from a step rate input, in terms\nof the error in the indication of the inertial frame is evidenced in Fig. 7.4.5. As\nexpected, an inertial frame error in the Y and the Z axes occurs that corresponds\nto the change in rate applied about the X reference triad axis. The rate change\naffects the E and F instruments which have their OAs colinear with the X-axis.

This system includes self-contained fault\ndetection and isolation (FDI) with reorganizational processing routines and recertification of "healed" or transient failures.\n\nThe FDI algorithms have demonstrated\n\nreliable nonambiguous fault isolation with as many as two gyro and two accelerometer\nmeasurement axes failures and positive fault detection for a third failure.\nThe SIRU program has demonstrated that a comprehensive inertial navigation\nand redundancy management software system for a strapdown dodecahedron redundant\nconfiguration\n\ncan\n\nbe successfully\n\nintegrated in\n\na representative minicomputer\n\n(DDP- 516) operating at 50 iterations per second (36% machine time) with a reasonable\nmemory allocation (7000 16-bit words). This software system includes the strapdown\nprocessing (twelve instrument static and dynamic compensation, attitude and velocity\nalgorithms) redundancy management (FDI, processing, reorganization, etc.), system\nsoftware ipreflight calibration,\n\nalignment,\n\nand navigation),\n\nand operating\n\nsoftware (dedicated executive, I/O servicing and display).\nSome discussion based on the total SIRU test experience, as it relates to and\naffirms the motivation for a redundant implementation, seems desirable.\nThe SIRU equipment, although a first development model, has proven to be\nremarkably reliable (over 20,000 hours of system operation with only 5 hardware\nfailures (two of which would typically have been edited out of reliability estimates\nas workmanship or correctable design deficiencies).\n\nThe fact that these failures\n\ndid occur during the SIRU system testing and that they did not compromise continuing\nsystem operation is of significance.\n\nIn each case the processing software automati-\n\ncally adapted to reflect the failure status and changed the processing structure to\nomit bad\n\ndata and yield a\n\nminimum\n\nerror propagation solution for continued\n\nsatisfactory system performance. First, from a hardware point of view the failures\ndid not result in any systematic degradation, i.e., the redundant hardware features\nretained their integrity and no secondary system operational or performance effects\n\nDuring the SIRU Utilization phase of this contract (R-747), third failure isolation\ncapabilities were demonstrated for those situations in which a third performance\nfailure error magnitude was worse than an already existing and isolated performance\nfailure. In addition, the capability to recalibrate and thereby recertify a failure\nthat corresponds to a stable performance change was also demonstrated.\nDescribed in SIRU Utilization Report, R-747.\n\n188\n\nwere observed.\n\nSecond, although several of the failures were of a performance\n\ndegradation type that could not have been detected or isolated by self-monitoring\nelectronics typically identified as BITE (Built-in Test Equipment), they were reliably\ndetected and isolated by the FDI software algorithms.\nThe soft failures that did occur present a broad spectrum of different failure\nmode phenomena,\n\ne.g.,\n\na random float-freedom\n\ngyro problem; a malfunctioning\n\npreamplifier in the torque loop with attendent variance type data output performance\nand a gyro SF degradation due to a gradually deteriorating solder joint. In a simplex\ntriad inertial system implementation, these types of failure modes would, in a space\nmission, probably cause a mission abort. Had the transient failures occurred in a\ncritical mission phase, crew safety would probably be endangered.\n\nIn a prelaunch\n\nor preflight phase, the transient gyro float-freedom and variance data output failure\nphenomena might possibly have been observed on a coincidental basis.\n\nEven if\n\nobserved, verification and isolation diagnostics in the vehicle would be time consuming\nwith limited probability of success. In comparison, the SIRU system using real-time\ncontinuous FDI detected and isolated the failures to the replaceable modular functional\naxes.\n\nIn each case, as the system repair was being made, the utility and advantage\n\nof the interchangeable modular instrument module concept was clearly in evidence.\nThe faulty instrument module was readily replaced by another module, within the\ntolerance described previously, usually in less than six minutes.\nThe motivating need for a redundant system implementation remains apparent\nfor missions\n\nwith time-critical\n\nreliability phases\n\nor long term\n\nmissions, as\n\ncharacterized by the space shuttle, anticipated satellite space missions and current\nand anticipated commercial and military aircraft operations.\n\nThe SIRU program\n\nhas demonstrated a realizable and efficient solution to the high reliability operational\nreadiness questions posed by these applications.\nIn the final\n\nsummary the concepts formulated\n\nand developed\n\nin the SIRU\n\ndodecahedron redundant modular configuration have been successfully demonstrated\nand matured in both hardware and software.\n\nCommitment of strapdown technology\n\nfor avariety of applications is forthcoming and the SIRU performance achievements\nin strapdown technology represent another significant step toward that realization.\n9.2.3 Supplementary Conclusions\nAs noted in the introduction of this report, NASA in 1972, subsequent to the\nbasic development activity described in this report, funded additional SIRU effort\nto further mature and utilize concepts of redundancy management and to implement\n\n189\n\nother operational features such as preflight single position calibration, self- alignment\nand navigation. This report reflects the achievements in hardware and basic software\nprior to the program extension.\ntechnical\n\nconcepts\n\nand\n\nReport R-747, a companion report, documents the\n\nachievements\n\nin\n\nthe development\n\nof statistical\n\nfailure\n\ndetection, isolation, classification and recalibration (FDICR) techniques, as well as\nthe operational software developments included in the SIRU Utilization program.\nIn recognition of the successful outcome of the effort in these areas some\nsupplementary conclusionary comment is in order in this report, especially as a\nprelude\n\nto any recommendations\n\nregarding further coherent\n\nredundant\n\nsystem\n\ntechnology development.\n\nSome of the most noteworthy achievements during the additional development\ndemonstration effort were:\n1)\n\nThe implementation of a statistical FDICR technique based on the "Wald"\nsequential probability test. This technique enabled detection and isolation,\nwith\n\na\n\nspecified\n\ncoverage\n\n(reliability,\n\nfalse\n\nand\n\nmissed\n\nalarm\n\nprobabilities), of mean performance shifts at levels equivalent to 1.5\ntimes the one sigma noise level of normal system operation. For example,\nin a quiescent maneuver environment,\n\nthe detection and isolation of a\n\n0\n\nbias shift as small as 0.07 /hr was routinely achieved with a background\nnoise level of 0.045 0 /hr.\n\nThe noise background corresponded to the An\n\nquantization in the two minute sampling period.\n\nSimilarly, performance\n\nstandard deviation changes on the order of four times the nominal spread\nwere also detected and isolated.\n\nThe maximum attitude error accumulation prior to detection and\nisolation of a performance failure was bounded at 40 sec independent of\nthe magnitude of the performance degradation. Bias and ramp recompensation to better than .015\n\n0\n\n/hr and .0008\n\n0\n\n/hr/minute respectively were\n\ndemonstrated repeatedly for the static environment. Accelerometer bias\nerrors of 0.1 cm/sec 2 and ramp errors of 0.02 cm/sec2/minute in a\nstatic environment were also detected and bias compensation to 0.02\ncm/sec 2 or less effected.\n2)\n\nA single position lumped parameter self-calibration\n0.015\n\n0\n\nto approximately\n\n/hr or better in the static environment was consistently achieved\n\nusing the technique developed and implemented.\n\n190\n\n3)\n\nThe self-alignment software, implemented in a coarse/fine sequential\nprogram achieved totally acceptable magnitudes regardless of the enviCoarse alignment to less than 10 in a\n\nronment input during testing.\n\nfixed 260 second period and fine alignment to less than 1 milliradian in\n15 minutes were consistently attained.\n4)\n\nEnd-to-end performance,\n\ndemonstrated as the output of a local level\n\nnavigator, was on the order of 0.5 nm/hr or less for all static tests.\n9. 3\n\nRecommendations\nThe concepts of redundant modular strapdown technology have been clearly\n\ndemonstrated and matured in the SIRU technology programs documented by these\nreports.\n\nThe modular hardware implementation and the operating software have\n\nundergone a comprehensive laboratory evaluation.\nevolutionary\n\nprogram\n\nstep\n\nto\n\nestablish\n\nThe obvious and next logical\n\nconfidence\n\nin\n\nthis technology\n\nand\n\nto\n\ndemonstrate its unique advantages should be in the commitment of the SIRU system\nto a realistic broad-based flight test evaluation.\nSuch a flight test effort should seek to establish a base line for Guidance and\nNavigation performance of the strapdown implementation across the full spectrum\nof flight environments and mission phases. The utility of the redundant implementation with its fault tolerant operation and its ability to provide a direct measure of\nits operational readiness represents an important factor to evaluate and demonstrate\nin\n\npre-flight and -in-flight operations.\n\nenhancement\n\noffered\n\nSimilarly, the\n\nby the comprehensive\n\nlogistic and\n\nredundancy,\n\nself-test\n\nmaintenance\nsoftware,\n\nand\n\nhardware modularity should be assessed in an operational environment. With respect\nto the redundancy management\nenhancement\n\nand the\n\ndesign\n\nsignificance\n\nfeatures,\n\nof the SIRU\n\nboth the statistical\ndodecahedron\'s\n\nreliability\n\nfail-operational\n\ncharacteristics in time-critical mission phases can be evaluated and demonstrated.\nCommitment of the SIRU technology to such a test program should be proceeded\nby the integration of the SIRU inertial hardware with a complementary redundant\ncomputer complex.\n\nDevelopment of a special purpose redundant computer system\n\ndoes not appear to be realistic technically nor economically feasible.\n\nA concept\n\nbased on the utilization of available general purpose computers replicated in triplicate\nwith fail-safe input/output\n\ninterfacing to achieve fault-tolerant, fail-operational\n\nmission performance for a single "soft" computer failure represents a practical\nand realizable flight demonstration approach.\n\nHowever, the more challenging and\n\nbasic computer redundancy implementation approach requires the development of a\nhigh confidence FDI technique for a dual computer complex.\n\n191\n\nFor example, in a\n\ntriplicate system, after the first computer failure, should one abort the mission if\ncritical flight safety phases remain?\n\nConversely, can one sufficiently characterize\n\npotential computer failure modes, as they relate to total system operation, to enable\nthe development of a high confidence fail-operational FDI for the remaining duplex\nconfiguration? At a minimum, the formulationof a suitable dual redundant computer\ncomplex with special emphasis on a reliable FDI approach and means for re-initialization betweeen computers to resolve transient failure phenomena is highly recommended for integration with the SIRU inertial subsystem.\nConsistent with the integration of SIRU with the computer complex is the need\nto\n\nfabricate and\n\nintegrate a multiplexer interface unit with suitable,\nThe original SIRU\n\nmultiplexer\n\ndesign\n\n(not\n\ncomputer,\n\nexpansion\n\nfabricated\n\ndue to program funding limitations) should be reviewed and revised to\n\nreflect\n\ncapabilities.\n\ntriplicate\n\nthe more advanced\n\nstate of currently available electronics.\n\nThe\n\nSIRU\n\nlaboratory test experience, the computer complex FDI implementation as formulated,\nand flight operations interactive man-machine considerations should also be reflected\nin the advanced design. The built-in test equipment (BITE) features to be incorporated\nin the multiplexer should complement the software FDI by enabling automatic fault\nlocation diagnostics to the different axis functions (i.e., wheel supply, dc axis supply,\netc. ) to optimize system maintenance.\nBITE should also incorporate failure status data display for those hardware\nfunctions that do not reflect as unique axis failures in the software FDI. This display\nwould communicate to the mission operator in real-time the status of the triple\nredundant clocks and dual redundant scalers and 40v power supplies (these redundant\nelements use hardware FDI and active or passive switching provisions in their\nredundant mechanization).\nWithin the software area some limited development appears desirable to enable\na more comprehensive evaluation of possible pilot/ system interfacing.\n\nThe current\n\nSIRU executive software is dedicated and non-interactive except for mode switching\nphases, i.e., alignment, navigation, etc.\n\nAn interactive executive allowing flexible\n\nexamination of different system parameters, modification of compensation loads,\nredundancy in processing conditions and maintenance diagnostics should be developed.\nIn addition, the incorporation of the software compensation routines evolved in the\nSPOT program (MIT/DL Report R- 743) for compensation of anisoinertia, SRA cross\ncoupling and scale factor linearity appears to be desirable and a review of the OA\ncompensation bandwidth characteristics should be effected.\n\n192\n\nIn the area of advanced software development, the concepts evolved in the\nSIRU Utilization program can be advantageously matured.\n\nStudies to relate the\n\nFDI criteria automatically to mission phase and dynamics should be conducted and\ncorresponding software demonstrations effected. The single- position self-calibration\ntechnique should be augmented to advantageously utilize optical alignment data as\nwell as other alignment aids.\n\nThe evolution of techniques to apportion drift change\n\ncorrection among the bias and g-sensitive coefficients should be initiated.\n\nFinally,\n\nthe efficient utilization for flight operations of the total integrated redundant system\nwith SIRU\n\nand the redundant\n\ncomputer complex\n\nas a core structure could be\n\nadvantageously explored. For example, the SIRU sensing data could also redundantly\nprovide flight control and stabilization sensing and attitude and heading display,\nthereby efficiently and reliably replacing\n\na multiplicity of independent sensors.\n\nThe integration of radio-navigation and landing aids with the SIRU concept in a\nredundant implementation should be explored to evaluate total system concepts and\nto develop and demonstrate operational inflight usage of such aids for inertial system\nalignment and compensation improvement.\n\nThe entire concept of statistical fault\n\ndetection, isolation, classification and recalibration evolved in the SIRU program\nshould be reviewed for more comprehensive total guidance, navigation, and control\nsystem application.\nSeveral hardware recommendations and studies appear to be desirable.\n\nThe\n\nSIRU hardware technology demonstrated modular concepts within the boundaries of\nreasonable physical size and weight allocations that were possible using the electronic\ncomponents and packaging technology of the 1960\'s.\n\nThe modularity concept is a\n\nsound concept, creating both a building block system design and simplified logistic\nand maintenance operations.\n\nThe application of the technology of the 70\'s (expected\n\nto include the maturing of medium-scale circuit integration, the advent of realizable\nlarge-scale integration, and the availability of improved hybrid circuit capabilities)\nto the modular concept would enable realization of a totally integrated modular concept.\nA completely self-sufficient instrument module using a single power source and a\ndigital data bus concept for input and output could be realized. Preliminary studies\nof such a design using the Charles Stark Draper Laboratory 13 size instrument\nform factor and MSI/hybrid packaging techniques indicate that an entire SIRU system\nconsisting of six each accelerometer and gyro self-contained modules (no supporting\nelectronic assembly) could be developed in a volume of 0.25 cubic feet which would\nweigh less than 25 lbs. Basic to such a concept however is a second logistic objective;\nto provide in the module interchangeable sensor compatibility features, i.e., ability\nto interface with several different available inertial instruments.\nStudy and\ndevelopment in this area as well as in the integrated modular approach is recommended.\n\n193\n\nFinally the continued evolution and improvement of strapdown inertial instruments is considered most important.\nThe Draper Laboratory 18 IRIG Mod B\ngyroscope has been significantly matured during the course of the SIRU and recently\nNavy sponsored programs. The performance and reliability of the permanent magnet\nversion of the 18 IRIG Mod D gyroscope has demonstrated significant potentials\nand should be evaluated for high reliability, high performance, moderate rate\napplications.\n\nSimilarly, the size 13 gyro and accelerometer technology exhibits\nthe ability to accomodate an extremely wide dynamic rate range, in excess of 2000/sec,\nand to provide moderate drift performance.\nconcepts are under investigation.\n\nEven smaller and more promising\n\nIndustrial technology is making similar advances\n\nand should also be encouraged.\n\nThe cornerstone of future strapdown technology\nand its acceptance lies in today\'s instrument development and continued support is\nhighly recommended.\n\n194\n\nAPPENDIX A\nMATRIX PROCESSOR\n1.0 Introduction\n\nFor the six gyros, in the SIRU system, the relationship between angular rate\ninputs (w) about the selected triad axes and the gyro measurements (m) is conveniently expressed in matrix form in terms of the geometry as\nm = Hb\n\n(1)\n\nwhere\nbT =[\nmT\n\nmb\n\n[ma\n\ns\n\nHT =\n\nmd\n\nme\n\nmf]\n\n-c\n\n-c\n\no\n\no\n\n-s\nC\n\nC\n\nz]\n\nmc\n\n-s\n\no\n\ny\n\nx\n\nO\n\ns\n\nc\n\nO\n\nS\n\nS\n\nand\n=\n\nCosine of the dodecahedron half angle\n\n=\n\nc\n\n0. 8506508083\n\ns\n\nSine of the dodecahedron half angle\n0.5257311122\n\nEquation (1) clearly shows the redundant information of the rates about the\ntriad axes (X, Y and Z) resident in the SIRU configuration.\n\nData from any three\n\ngyros (accelerometers) may be used to determine the equivalent triad axis rate\n(acceleration).\nThe process structure used to obtain the equivalent triad solutions from the\ndodecahedron array corresponds to a weighted least squares solution form\nb = (H T\n\n0-1 H)-1\n\nA-1\n\nH T o-1\n\nm\n\nwhere b\' is defined as the best triad solution estimate and \xe2\x82\xac corresponds to a diagonal 6 x 6 matrix whose terms represent the individual variances. This solution\nprovides a best estimate where both the geometric properties of the configuration\nand the individual instrument performance statistics are considered.\nFor the SIRU system, weighting of the instruments\n\ndata was not considered\n\n1\n\napplicable and a status matrix X was substituted for 0- . All diagonal elements of\nX are 1 when all instruments are performing satisfactorily, and the appropriate\nelement is set to 0 when an instrument failure is detected.\nIn the actual computer mechanization,\n\nthis is accomplished by storage of\n\ncommon constants (Kij) which are algebraically used to achieve the appropriate\nleast squares solution based on the status of the instruments.\n2. 0 Implementation\nTo minimize computer operations, the matrix processor depicted in Figure\nA-1 was implemented.\n\nAssemble Fail Status into a\nSix Bit Pattern as in the\nExample for

B-1 Compensation Software Flow Chart\nThe first step in gyro compensation adds the finer quantization information\nfrom the gyro interpolator electronics to the accumulated gyro pulses. This added\ninformation reduces the loop quantization from 44 sec to approximately 5.5 sec per\npulse.\n\nThe resulting raw attitude datais scaled by the gyro scale factor to determine\nthe input\n\naxis\n\nangular\n\nrotation.\n\nScaling is accomplished\n\nB-1\n\nby\n\nfirst sizing the\n\naccumulated pulses to a nominal scale factor (an even power of 2 for\ncomputational\nefficiency), and then, correcting for the deviation of the true scale\nfactor from the\nnominal value. The scale factor correction is determined for each\ngyro from the\ncalibration test data and stored in memory by a load making program.\nBias drift (NBD) is compensated with incremental corrections\napplied to the\ngyro pulse count. The magnitude of the correction is derived from\nthe NBD calibration\nvalue (from static test) applied to the compensation iteration\nperiod.\nAcceleration sensitive drift components (ADIA, ADOA,\nADSRA, and major\ncompliance) are corrected by triad referenced acceleration\nestimates derived from\nthe accelerometer outputs. The gyro drift error magnitudes\nare calibrated using a\nsix position procedure (discussed in Chapter 4), but are rescaled\nto the triad frame\nfor compensation purposes. Thus, the accelerometer derived\nvelocity increments\nin the triad frame are applied directly to effect the appropriate\ncorrection to the\naccumulated gyro pulses. The magnitude of correction is dependent\non the drift\nerror magnitude, the velocity increment estimate, and the\niteration period. Since\nthe correction is based on triad referenced velocity data,\nthe compensation scheme\nis independent of first instrument failure and therefore is\nredundant.\nOutput axis coupling drift errors result from a lagging\nfloat motion in response\nto rate changes about the output axis (OA). Hence,\nextra torque pulses will occur\nto maintain the float at its null position as the gyro case\nis accelerated. Compensation\nis accomplished by using angular estimates about\nthe OA of each gyro. These\nacceleration estimates are derived directly from\nthe body triad data (XYZ) since\neach gyro\'s OA is colinear with the reference\ntriad.\nThe magnitude of the\ncompensation is determined by weighing the OA\nrate change estimates by the gyro\nparameter ratio I/H (moment of inertia about OA divided\nby wheel angular momentum).\nSpin axis\n\ncross\n\ncoupling and the anisoinertia drift errors result\nfrom\nsimultaneous rates applied about the input axis\n(IA) and the spin reference axis\n(SRA). For the 18 IRIG Mod B gyro the anisoinertia\nmagnitude is approximately\nequal and of opposite effect to the spin axis\ncross coupling error. Thus, the two\nerror sources cancel in the propagation\nof attitude errors. These error sources,\nwhile correctable, are not compensated in SIRUat\nthis time.\nGyro misalignment angle errors are compensated\nby subtracting from the\ngyro pulse count the product of the estimated rate\nderived from the triad referenced\nvectors and the fixed misalignment (determined from\ndynamic test). The gyro\nmisalignment calibration is obtained by each\nindividual instrument referenced to\n\nB-2\n\nthe\n\ndodecahedron frame.\n\nHowever,\n\nfor compensation\n\npurposes,\n\nthe alignment\n\nmagnitudes are projected to the triad configuration such that the triad derived rate\nestimate can be applied\n\ndirectly in\n\nthe compensation process.\n\nThe additional\n\ncomponent of OA misalignment error, which represents the effect of float hangoff\ndue to the applied input rate, is\n\nlumped with the dynamic error term (spin axis\n\ncross coupling) described above.\nAccelerometer Compensations\nThe accelerometer accumulated pulse data is scaled to determine the magnitude\nof the velocity increment.\n\nAn average scale factor, based on positive and negative\n\nacceleration input calibrations, is used.\nAccelerometer\n\nbias is compensated by adding increments to the pulse count.\n\nThe magnitude is based on the bias magnitude (from static test) and the duration of\nthe compensation interval.\nThe accelerometer misalignment angles are fixed quantities dependent on the\nmounting alignment and determined by calibration tests. Misalignment errors are\ncorrected by subtracting the estimated acceleration errors due to the misalignments\nfrom the input accelerometer pulse count.\nCentripetal acceleration (Rw2 ) and tangential acceleration (RL ) normalization\nis required because of the dispersed locations of the individual accelerometers.\nIdeally, the mass elements of all accelerometers should be located at a single point.\nSince this condition is obviously impossible to obtain, corrections are introduced\nto account for the distance from an assumed single point to the actual location of\neach accelerometer mass element.\n\nThe error correction is computed from this\ndistance, the body angular rate, and the change in rate over the compensation interval.\nIn SIRU, the A accelerometer mass element is the single point reference.\nAccelerometer OA coupling, pendulous axis cross coupling and the G 2 error\nterms donot introduce substantial system errors and are not compensated in SIRU.\nA

main executive\n\nof the system operating\n\nprogram (MPRO)\n\ncalls\n\nthe\n\nappropriate subroutines to accomplish the algorithms shown in Fig. 4.3.3 of Chapter\n4 and the system tasks listed there It is divided into three sections. The first is\ninitialization and the enabling of interrupt.\n\nNext is a waiting loop which checks to\n\nsee if it is time for output and, if so, calls the proper output routines.\n\nWhen this\n\nwaiting loop is interrupted (every 5 milliseconds), the program sequence goes to\nthe third section which decides when the time has come to update the accelerometer\nor gyro algorithms, retains the processing registers as they were at the time of\ninterrupt, calls the appropriate algorithms, restores the processing registers and\nreturns to whatever was being processed at the time of interrupt.\nThe subroutines which accomplish these various activities are identified and\ndescribed briefly as follows.\nALPO\nALPO provides system status information formatted as shown in Fig. 4.3.4\nof Chapter 4 on teletype, CRT screen or as a block of 104 bytes on Digistore tape.\nSFPOUT\nSFPOUT and OUT100 provide the ALPO information in decimal numbers and\nseconds of time.\nSXOU\nThis routine determines whether the ALPO information is displayed on teletype\nor CRT screen.\nSDGS\n\nThis routine causes the information to be written onto the Digistore tape.\n\nREAD\nREAD causes either the gyro and accelerometer\n\ninterface to interrupt the\n\nmain program every 5 milliseconds. These interruptions start with the accelerometer\nand alternate between the accelerometer and the gyro.\n\nAt each interruption the six\n\nappropriate pulse counters are read and the contents stored.\n\nScaling is 2- 6 pulses\n\nwhich represents 1 pulse AV as 4 cm/sec and 1 pulse AO as 7x2 - 15 radians.\n\nD-2\n\nACOM\nThis subroutine compensates each accelerometer output for scale factor, bias\nand two misalignments.\n\nGCOM\nGCOM compensates each gyro output for SF, NBD, ADIA, ADOA, ADSRA major\ncompliances and OA coupling.\nDCMT\nThis subroutine modifies the misalignments of the gyro about the output axis\nas a function of the measured input rate at each update.\n\nThe information is stored\n\nin the base sector where it is available for the gyro compensation program.\nDCOA\nDCOA calculates a compensation for the error resulting from the effect of a\nrotational input on the output gyro axis.\nROMS\nWhen a strapdown system is subjected to a rotational input, accelerometers\nwill sense acceleration due to Rw 2 and Rw.\n\nSince the several accelerometers do\n\nnot sense these rotations at the same point, they will appear to be in disagreement\none to another.\npoint.\n\nROMS compensates the output to represent the origin as a single\n\nFor convenience,\n\nthe center of accelerometer\n\nA is the chosen single point\n\nwhich makes it necessary to compensate only the other five instruments.\n\nGARC\nThis subroutine accumulates the six compensated gyro pulse counts and stores\nthem for the squared error calculation.\n\nIt also accumulates the total of the change\n\nin count for use in GFIS.\n\nPREX\nPREX accomplishes the same operation for accelerometers as GARC performs\nfor the gyros.\n\nD-3\n\nGFIS\nThis subroutine controls the logic for the gyro FDI procedure.\n\nOnce every\n\nupdate it decides which failure should be searched for by consideration of the gyro\nfail status and identification from the previous search.\n\nIt then stores the maximum\n\nallowable total squared error for either the first or second failure search.\nERDE\n\nERDE is called up by either the gyro or accelerometer FDI logic and provides\nthe information required to identify the failure.\n\nCFSE\nThis subroutine calculates either the first or second squared error terms\nfor instruments from the set of accumulated measurements, decides whether the\ntotal squared error exceeds a certain limit and, if it does, decides if any instruments\nsquared error exceeds a certain percentage of the total.\n\nIf the calculations show\n\nan error equalling or exceeding 212 pulses or the total squared error exceeds 224\nan indication is\n\nprovided that the calculations could not be completed due to huge\n\nerrors in one or more instruments.\nPRIS\n\nThis subroutine controls the logic for the accelerometer FDI procedure and\nis substantially the same as GFIS.\n\nThe accelerometer maximum allowable squared\n\nerrors are not modified prior to this operation as is the case of the gyro GFIS.\nGPRT\nThis subroutine is\n\na further extension of the gyro FDI.\n\nIt determines the\n\nfailure status and identifies the proper parity equations to solve.\nPRTY\nPRTY solves the proper parity equations to provide detection for a third gyro\nfailure.\nPPEX\nThis subroutine is the accelerometer equivalent of the PRTY routine for gyros.\n\nD-4\n\nGMIN\nGMIN, using the gyro fail status instructions from the gyro least-squares\nmatrix generator, calculates which of the 22 matrices to generate.\nGPMA\nThis subroutine is the least-squares matrix\n\ngenerator for gyros and ac-\n\ncelerometers.\nEMIN\nEMIN is the accelerometer equivalent of the gyro GMIN subroutine.\nMG63\nThis subroutine performs the 6x3 matrix multiplications which transform the\nsix gyro\n\nAO outputs into the XYZ frame.\n\nMP63\nMP63 is the accelerometer equivalent of the gyro MG63 subroutine.\nSPUN\nThis subroutine corrects the quaternion to maintain it at a unity value, i.e.\n2\n\n+ p\n\n2\n\nx\n\ny\n\n2 + p 2= 1\nz\n\nVESP\nThis subroutine constructs a cosine matrix from the quaternion, transforming\na vector in the body frame to the inertial frame.\n\nIt then multiplies the AV in the\n\nbody frame by this matrix to transform AV into the inertial frame.\nVACU\n\nVACU accumulates delta velocity in the inertial frame.\n\nD-5\n\nERC6\n\nThis subroutine accomplishes the equivalent of torquing a gyro in a gimbal\nIMU.\n\nIt essentially compensates the gyro for a drift in the inertial frame and is\n\nused to take out earth rate.\n\nIt does this compensation by transforming the negative\n\nof the drift in the inertial frame into the body frame by adding it to the gyro output\nas an equivalent NBD.\nAA6S\n\nAA6S performs a third order attitude algorithm to update the quaternion of\nrotation.\n\nD-6\n\nSIRU BIBLIOGRAPHY\n1.\n\nWeinstein,\n\n2.\n\nGilmore, J.
