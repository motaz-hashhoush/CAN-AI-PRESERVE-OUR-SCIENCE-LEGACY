b"Active Debris Removal and the Challenges for Environment Remediation\nBy J.-C. LIOU1)\n1)\n\nNASA Orbital Debris Program Office, NASA Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas, USA\n\nRecent modeling studies on the instability of the debris population in the low Earth orbit (LEO) region and the collision\nbetween Iridium 33 and Cosmos 2251 have underlined the need for active debris removal. A 2009 analysis by the NASA\nOrbital Debris Program Office shows that, in order to maintain the LEO debris population at a constant level for the next\n200 years, an active debris removal of about five objects per year is needed. The targets identified for removal are those\nwith the highest mass and collision probability products in the environment. Many of these objects are spent upper stages\nwith masses ranging from 1 to more than 8 metric tons, residing in several altitude regions and concentrated in about 7\ninclination bands. To remove five of those objects on a yearly basis, in a cost-effective manner, represents many challenges\nin technology development, engineering, and operations. This paper outlines the fundamental rationale for considering\nactive debris removal and addresses the two possible objectives of the operations \xe2\x80\x93 removing large debris to stabilize the\nenvironment and removing small debris to reduce the threat to operational spacecraft. Technological and engineering\nchallenges associated with the two different objectives are also discussed.\nKey Words: Orbital Debris, Modeling, Active Debris Removal\n\nthe anti-satellite test (ASAT) conducted by China in 2007, the\nfragmentation debris were almost all explosion fragments.\nAfter the ASAT test and the collision between Iridium 33 and\nCosmos 2251, the ratio of collision fragments to explosion\nfragments was about one-to-one. It is expected that accidental\ncollision fragments will further dominate the environment in\nthe future.\n\nNomenclature\nGEO\nLEO\nMEO\nM\n\n\xcf\x83\n\nPc\n\n:\n:\n:\n:\n:\n:\n\ngeosynchronous orbit\nlow Earth orbit\nmedium Earth orbit\nmass\nstandard deviation\ncollision probability\n\n1. Introduction\nAfter more than 50 years of space activities, the near-Earth\nenvironment is populated with orbital debris. This\nenvironmental pollution is creating problems for robotic and\nhuman space programs. On average, two Shuttle window\npanels are replaced after every mission due to damage by\nmicrometeoroid or orbital debris impacts. More than 100\ncollision avoidance maneuvers were conducted by satellite\noperators in 2010 to reduce the impact risks of their satellites\nwith respect to objects in the US Space Surveillance Network\n(SSN) catalog. Of the four known accident collisions between\nobjects in the SSN catalog, the last one \xe2\x80\x93 collision between\nCosmos 2251 and the operational Iridium 33 in 2009, was the\nmost significant. It was the first ever accidental catastrophic\ndestruction of an operational satellite by another satellite. It\nalso signaled the potential collision cascade effect in the\nenvironment, commonly known as the \xe2\x80\x9cKessler Syndrome,\xe2\x80\x9d\npredicted by Kessler and Cour-Palais in 19781).\nFig. 1 shows the historical increase of objects in the SSN\ncatalog. The SSN sensors are capable of tracking objects 10\ncm and larger. As of April 2011, the total of the tracked\npopulation exceeds 22,000. However, approximately 6000 of\nthem have yet to be entered into the catalog. The population is\ndominated by fragmentation debris throughout history. Before\n\nFig. 1. Increase of the historical SSN catalog population through April\n2011. The number of operational spacecraft is only about 1000, which\nrepresents a small component in the environment.\n\nThe debris population does not stop at 10 cm. Additional\nradar data indicate that at the 1 cm level the total is at least\nseveral hundred thousand. At the 1 mm level, the population is\nestimated to be on the order of hundreds of millions. Due to\nthe high impact speed in space, objects as small as 0.1 mm\npose certain safety concerns to satellite operators. The wellshielded U.S. modules of the International Space Station (ISS)\nare protected against debris smaller than 1.4 cm. For a typical\n\n1\n\noperational spacecraft, however, hypervelocity impact by\ndebris 5 mm and larger is likely to lead to mission-ending\ndamage.\nFig. 2 depicts the historical increase of the mass of objects in\norbit. Unlike the curves in Fig. 1, which are heavily influenced\nby major breakups, the mass increase is relatively steady over\ntime. The total mass is dominated by rocket bodies (R/Bs) and\nspacecraft (S/Cs). They combine for approximately 96% of\nthe mass in orbit. Although more than half of the catalog\nobjects are fragmentation debris, they only account for less\nthan 3% of the total mass in space.\n\nimplemented, such as maneuvering satellites at the end of life\nFig.3. Projected growth of the \xe2\x89\xa510 cm populations in LEO, MEO, and\nGEO for the next 200 years. The simulations assumed nominal launches,\nbut no mitigation measures were implemented in the future.\n\nto the graveyard orbit region, the increase will be further\nreduced. Since there is no atmospheric drag to clean up the\nenvironment in MEO and GEO, the long-term build up of\ndebris will continue. However, there is no urgent need to\nconsider ADR in MEO and GEO in the near future.\n2. Active Debris Removal\n\nFig. 2. Historical mass increase of objects in Earth orbit. Variations due to\nShuttle missions are not included. More than 99% of the total mass is in\n\nRemoving debris from orbit is far more complicated than\nlaunching satellites. Several key questions must be addressed\nat the beginning of any ADR planning. They include 1) where\nis the most critical region for ADR, 2) what are the short- and\nlong-term mission objectives, 3) what objects should be\nremoved first, 4) what are the benefits to the environment, and\nfinally, 5) how to carry out the operations. The answers to\nthese questions will define the top-level requirements, drive\nthe necessary technology development, and guide the\nimplementation of the ADR operations. In addition, nontechnical issues, such as policy, coordination, ownership,\nlegal, and liability, will also influence the direction of ADR\nplanning and implementation.\nBased on the projection curves shown in Fig. 3, it is obvious\nthat any environment remediation in the foreseeable future\nshould focus on ADR operations in LEO. Mission objectives\nwill set the measures for success. Common mission\nobjectives, such as maximizing the benefit-to-cost ratio and\nfollowing practical mission constraints (in altitude,\ninclination, class, size, etc.) are always applicable to any ADR\nconcepts. Specific mission objectives, on the other hand, are\nvery diverse and will lead to very different forward paths.\nThese objectives include, for example, controlling the LEO\npopulation growth (\xe2\x89\xa510 cm or others), limiting collision\nactivities, mitigating short- or long-term risks (damage, not\nnecessarily catastrophic destruction) for selected payloads, or\nmitigating risks for human space activities. Once a specific\nmission objective is selected, it needs to be further quantified\n(e.g., limiting the population growth or reducing mission-end\nthreat to a pre-set level) to define the mission requirements.\n\n10 cm and larger objects.\n\nThe projected growth of the future debris environment is\nshown in Fig. 3. It is a summary of a recent study based on the\nLEGEND model developed by the NASA Orbital Debris\nProgram Office. The study assumed nominal launches in the\nfuture, but no mitigation measures were implemented. In\nessence, this is a worst-case scenario. The environment is\ndivided into three zones. Low Earth orbit (LEO) is the region\nbelow 2000 km altitude. The geosynchronous (GEO) region is\n200 km within the geosynchronous altitude. Finally, the\nregion between LEO and GEO is defined as medium Earth\norbit (MEO). Each projection curve is the average of 100\nLEGEND Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. The 1-\xcf\x83 standard\ndeviation for each curve is also included in the figure.\nThe rapid increase of the debris population in LEO is a wellknown trend1). It was the motivation for the development of\nthe mitigation measures, such as passivation and the 25-year\nrule, by the international community in the last two decades.\nHowever, recent analyses have shown that the commonlyadopted mitigation measures will not be sufficient to stabilize\nthe environment2,3). Therefore, to better limit the growth of the\ndebris population in LEO, active debris removal (ADR) must\nbe considered4). (The definition of ADR is to remove debris\nbeyond the mitigation guidelines currently adopted by the\ninternational space community.)\nThe projected population growths in MEO and GEO over the\nnext 200 years are not as severe as that in LEO. Even under\nthe worst-case, non-mitigation assumption, the increase is\nvery moderate. When postmission disposal (PMD) options are\n2\n\nJacchia 1977 atmospheric model for the drag calculation7).\nSmall debris tend to have high area-to-mass ratios (A/Ms).\nFor those with perigees below about 1000 km altitude, they\nare subject to strong atmospheric drag perturbation. What the\ncurves in Fig. 5 show is that, at any given altitude below 1000\nkm, the 5-mm-to-1-cm debris rapidly decay toward lower\naltitudes. At the same time, the region is rapidly replenished\nby debris spiraling down from higher altitudes on a yearly\nbasis. The environment is highly dynamic, and could have\nstrong short-term (i.e., monthly to yearly) episodic variations.\n\nWhat debris objects should be removed first depends on the\nspecific mission objective. The cumulative size distribution,\nplotted at the half-decade points, of the LEO-crossing objects\nin 2011 is shown in Fig. 4. The populations at 10 cm and\nlarger come from the SSN catalog. The populations at 5 mm, 1\ncm, and 5 cm are estimated from the Goldstone, Haystack, and\nHAX radar data5). The populations below 10 cm roughly\nfollow a power-law size distribution \xe2\x80\x93 meaning there are far\nmore smaller debris than larger ones. This means the main\nmission-ending threat for operational S/Cs in the environment\ncomes from debris just above the threshold of the vehicle\xe2\x80\x99s\nimpact protection shields. Since S/Cs all have different\nconfigurations and designs, the \xe2\x80\x9ccritical debris size\xe2\x80\x9d varies\nfrom S/C to S/C. For most operational S/Cs, any impact by\ndebris between 5 mm and 1 cm is likely to cause mission-end\ndamage. The chances of similar damage diminish if the S/C is\nimpacted by smaller debris.\nBased on the size distribution of Fig. 4, debris in the 5-mmto-1-cm regime represent about 80% of all objects larger than\n5 mm. Therefore, if the mission objective is to reduce the\nmission-ending threat for operational S/Cs, then the ADR\noperations should focus on the 5-mm-to-1-cm objects. If the\nmission objective is to limit the growth of the debris\npopulation or to reduce the catastrophic collision activities in\nthe environment, then the ADR operations should focus on the\nroot cause of the problem \xe2\x80\x93 the massive and large (at least\nseveral meters in dimension) R/Bs and S/Cs4). Analyses of\nthese two different objectives are described below.\n\nFig.5. Altitude distributions of the 5-mm-to-1-cm Cosmos 2251 fragments\nbetween 2009 and 2019. Numbers in the parentheses indicate the total\nnumber of objects still in orbit.\n\nThe ISS example provided below outlines the analyses\nneeded and the technical challenges for removing small debris\nto reduce the threat for a critical operational spacecraft. The\nISS is constructed with the best micrometeoroid and orbital\ndebris impact protection in history. The U.S. modules of the\nISS are equipped with bumper shields that could withstand\nhypervelocity impacts by orbital debris 1.4 cm or smaller8).\nThe U.S. Joint Space Operations Center (JSpOC) conducts\nconjunction assessments for all operational spacecraft, with\nrespect to objects in the SSN catalog, and provides the\ninformation to the operators/owners of the vehicles involved\nfor each conjunction. (Based on the conjunction data, the ISS\nhas conducted 12 collision avoidance maneuvers since 1999.)\nTherefore, the main threat to the ISS comes from objects\nbetween 1.5 and 10 cm. In 2010, the number of objects in this\nsize range, and with orbits crossing the altitude of the ISS\n(330 to 360 km), was approximately 1200. Since these objects\nfollow a power-law size distribution (see also Fig. 4), about\n800 of them are between 1.5 and 3 cm. If the ADR objective is\nto reduce the threat to the ISS by removing, for example, 50%\nof the debris in this size range, then trade studies must be\nconducted to investigate various options for removal.\nLarge-area debris collectors made of different materials and\ndesigned with different configurations have been proposed for\nsmall debris removal. The technology readiness levels (TRLs)\nfor the commonly-mentioned capture mechanisms (e.g., using\nlow density materials) are relatively mature. The key difficulty\nfor the collector is in the large area-time product that will be\nneeded to remove any meaningful amount of small debris.\nBased on the estimated 1.5-to-3-cm debris flux at the ISS\naltitude in 2010, it will require a collector with an area-time\n\nFig. 4. Cumulative size distribution, between 5 mm and 1 m, of the LEOcrossing objects in 2011.\n\n2.1. Targeting the main threat for operational spacecraft\nThe main challenges for removing 5-mm-to-1-cm debris\nfrom LEO are related to the dynamic nature of the small\ndebris and the huge number of their presence in the\nenvironment. The former is illustrated in Fig. 5, where the\nsimulated evolution of the 5-mm-to-1-cm Cosmos 2251\nfragments between 2009 and 2019 is shown. The initial\nfragments were generated via the NASA Standard Breakup\nModel6). Individual fragments were then propagated forward\nin time, including Earth's J2, J3, J4, solar-lunar gravitational\nperturbations, solar radiation pressure, and atmospheric drag.\nNOAA\xe2\x80\x99s solar flux F10.7 projection was combined with the\n3\n\nproduct on the order of 1000 km2\xc2\xb7yr to remove 400 debris in\nthis size range. For a one-year operation at the ISS altitude,\nthe concept of a 1000 km2 cross-sectional area collector is\nsimply not practical. In addition, as illustrated in Fig. 5, the\nnear ISS environment will continue to be replenished by\ndebris decaying from higher altitudes. Any ADR operations of\nsmall debris, even if they are technically feasible and\neconomically viable, will have to be carried out continuously\nfor as long as the ISS remains active. To remove 5-mm-to-1cm debris at higher altitudes to better protect the majority of\nthe operational S/Cs will be even more challenging because\nthe demand for the area-time product will be significantly\nhigher.\nA ground- or space-based laser system is another concept\nbeing proposed for the removal of mm-to-cm-sized debris.\nThe unique technical challenges for this approach are the\npower required for the system, tracking capability for small\ndebris, and the pointing accuracy of the laser system. Because\nof the concern for space weapons, this concept faces more\nnon-technical issues than others.\n2.2. Targeting the root cause of the population growth\nThe future debris population growth will be driven by\nfragments generated from accidental collisions involving large\nand massive intacts (R/Bs or S/Cs). Therefore, the most\neffective way to limit the population growth is to remove the\nmajor \xe2\x80\x9cdebris generators\xe2\x80\x9d for such events. Major \xe2\x80\x9cdebris\ngenerators\xe2\x80\x9d are those that have the highest collision\nprobabilities with other objects in the environment, and when\nthey do collide with other objects, they have the potential of\ngenerating the greatest amount of fragments. The latter is a\nfunction of mass. Hence, the mass, M, and collision\nprobability, Pc, of each object can be used as a selection\ncriterion for removal9,10). Numerical simulations have shown\nthat, indeed, [M \xc3\x97 Pc] is an effective target selection criterion\nfor environment remediation in LEO4, 9-11).\nFig. 6 shows what will be needed to stabilize the LEO\npopulation with ADR based on the mass and collision\nprobability criterion. The historical environment, shown as the\ngray curve, included fragments from the ASAT test and the\ncollision between Iridium 33 and Cosmos 2251. Each\nprojection curve is the average of 100 LEGEND MC\nsimulations. The scenario for the top curve assumed nominal\nlaunches and a 90% compliance of PMD for all R/Bs and\nS/Cs. The middle curve shows that if an ADR of two objects\nper year was implemented after the year 2020 (denoted as\nADR2020/02 in the figure), the population growth could be\nreduced approximately by half. If the ADR was increased to\nfive objects per year (bottom curve), the population could be\nmaintained at a level similar to the current environment. It will\nrequire an even higher annual ADR rate if the objective is to\nreduce the future LEO population to a lower level.\nThe simulation results shown in Fig. 6 are intended to serve\nas a guide to illustrate the effectiveness of using [M \xc3\x97 Pc] as a\ntarget selection criterion, to quantify how many objects need\nto be removed, and to show the benefits to the environment by\ntargeting the root cause of the population growth. The\nconclusion that \xe2\x80\x9cremoving five objects per year can stabilize\nthe LEO environment\xe2\x80\x9d is somewhat notional. A key\n\nassumption in the simulations is the nominal launches during\nthe projection period. It is a common practice to repeat\nlaunches from the last 8 years for future environment\nsimulations. If future launches are very different from the\nrepeated cycle, including launch frequency, mission orbits,\nand vehicle masses, then the required ADR rate will be\ndifferent. Another assumption in the simulations is the\nimmediate removal of objects from the environment. If that is\nnot the case, then the required ADR rate will be somewhat\nhigher. Other factors, such as the compliance of the mitigation\nmeasures and the long-term solar activity projection, will also\naffect the number of ADR objects needed to stabilize the\nenvironment.\nLEO\xc2\xa0Environment\xc2\xa0Projection\xc2\xa0(averages\xc2\xa0of\xc2\xa0100\xc2\xa0LEGEND\xc2\xa0MC\xc2\xa0runs)\n24000\n\nReg\xc2\xa0Launches\xc2\xa0+\xc2\xa090%\xc2\xa0PMD\n\n20000\n\nEffective\xc2\xa0Number\xc2\xa0of\xc2\xa0Objects\xc2\xa0(>10\xc2\xa0cm)\n\n22000\n\nReg\xc2\xa0Launches\xc2\xa0+\xc2\xa090%\xc2\xa0PMD\xc2\xa0+\xc2\xa0ADR2020/02\nReg\xc2\xa0Launches\xc2\xa0+\xc2\xa090%\xc2\xa0PMD\xc2\xa0+\xc2\xa0ADR2020/05\n\n18000\n16000\n14000\n12000\n10000\n8000\n6000\n4000\n2000\n0\n1950\n\n1970\n\n1990\n\n2010\n\n2030\n\n2050\n\n2070\n\n2090\n\n2110\n\n2130\n\n2150\n\n2170\n\n2190\n\n2210\n\nYear\n\nFig.6.

Fig. 7 shows their apogee/perigee\naltitudes and inclinations. It can be seen that many of the\npotential targets fall into several well-defined classes of\nvehicles between 600 and 1050 km altitudes, and in seven\nnarrow inclination bands. These R/Bs and S/Cs have masses\nbetween 1 and 9 metric tons, and sizes up to more than 10\nmeters. The challenges for removing five such objects in a\ncost-effective manner, on a yearly basis, are monumental.\nTop\xc2\xa0500\xc2\xa0Current\xc2\xa0R/Bs\xc2\xa0and\xc2\xa0S/Cs\n\n1600\n1500\n\nApogee\n\n1400\n\nPerigee\n\n1300\nSL\xe2\x80\x9016\xc2\xa0R/B\xc2\xa0(8900\xc2\xa0kg)\nCosmos\xc2\xa0(3300\xc2\xa0kg)\n\nAltitude\xc2\xa0(km)\n\n1200\n\nSL\xe2\x80\x908\xc2\xa0R/B\xc2\xa0(1400\xc2\xa0kg)\n\n1100\n1000\n\nSL\xe2\x80\x908\xc2\xa0R/B\xc2\xa0(1400\xc2\xa0kg)\nMETEOR\xc2\xa0 (2000\xc2\xa0kg)\n\n900\nCosmos\xc2\xa0(1300\xc2\xa0kg)\nSL\xe2\x80\x903\xc2\xa0R/B\xc2\xa0(1440\xc2\xa0kg)\nMETEOR\xc2\xa0 (2200\xe2\x80\x902800\xc2\xa0kg)\n\n800\n\nVarious\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0R/Bs\xc2\xa0and\xc2\xa0S/Cs\n(SL\xe2\x80\x9016\xc2\xa0R/B,\xc2\xa0Envisat,\xc2\xa0 etc.,\n1000\xe2\x80\x908900\xc2\xa0kg)\n\n700\nSL\xe2\x80\x908\xc2\xa0R/B\xc2\xa0(1400\xc2\xa0kg)\nCosmos\xc2\xa0(2000\xc2\xa0kg)\n\n600\n\nCosmos\xc2\xa0(2500\xc2\xa0kg)\n\n500\n60\n\n65\n\n70\n\n75\n\n80\n\n85\n\n90\n\n95\n\n100\n\n105\n\nInclination\xc2\xa0(deg)\n\nFig.7. Altitude versus inclination distribution of potential ADR targets.\n\n4\n\npotential ADR targets have tumble rates above 1 rpm.\nGround-based radar or optical observations will be needed to\nsurvey the potential ADR targets to better characterize their\ntumble states and determine how these states might change\nover time. This is another area where new technologies will be\nneeded to stabilize the target if physical contact with the target\nis required during the removal operations.\nOnce a target is captured by the ADR system or is attached\nto a device, there are only two possible outcomes. For some\nADR concepts, it is possible to maneuver the target to the\ngraveyard orbit above 2000 km altitude. This option really is\nnot a solution. The cumulative debris mass eventually will\ncreate a new environment problem in the graveyard orbit. The\nbest end result for an ADR operation is to bring the target\ndown. However, the reentry risks of any large and massive\nR/B or S/C must be evaluated. If it is necessary to include a\ncontrolled reentry at the end, it will severely limit the ADR\noperational options and will increase the overall cost\nsignificantly.\n\nAn end-to-end ADR operation includes many components \xe2\x80\x93\nlaunch, propulsion, proximity operations, rendezvous, contact\n(capture or attachment), and finally, deorbit or graveyard\nmaneuver. From the cost perspective, multiple ADR systems\nper launch or secondary payload design are preferred. Options\nfor propulsion, both for the ADR system vehicle and for the\ndebris targets, are more diverse. The space tug concept based\non solid or liquid propellants is a mature technology, but the\npropellant mass and the operational cost may be too high for a\nroutine operation. Plasma propulsion has low TRL, but may\nturn into a good alternative. The concept of using\nelectrodynamic tethers as a means of removing large orbital\ndebris was first suggested in the early 1990s12). Once the\ntechnology is mature and demonstrated, it could provide a\npromising propellant-less option to deorbit ADR targets and to\nmaneuver the ADR system from target to target. However, the\ncollision risks of a long tether to other vehicles in the\nenvironment remain an open issue.\nAttaching a drag enhancement device, such as an inflatable\nballoon or a thin-film sail, to a massive debris object is\nanother potential low-cost option to deorbit ADR targets. The\neffectiveness of this concept is illustrated in Fig. 8. The orbital\nlifetime of an SL-8 second stage, with a mass of 1400 kg and\na 950 km altitude, is more than 200 years. The addition of a\nlightweight and large-area device will increase the total A/M\nof the system and cause it to decay more rapidly over time.\nFor example, a balloon with a diameter of about 27 m can\ndeorbit the second stage in 25 years. If the size of the balloon\nis increased to 100 m, then the orbital lifetime of the target can\nbe reduced to just 2 years. The dimensions of the balloons, or\nequivalent thin-film sails, are not that unreasonable. However,\nas the system decays toward lower altitudes, its collision risks\nto other satellites in the environment will need to be evaluated\nas well.\n\n3. Conclusions\nThe orbital debris problem is facing a critical point. The\ncommonly-adopted mitigation measures will not be sufficient\nto fully control the debris population growth in LEO. As the\ninternational community gradually reaches a consensus on the\nneed for ADR, the focus will shift from environment\nmodeling to completely different challenges \xe2\x80\x93 technology\ndevelopment, system engineering, and operations. As the\ncommunity takes on these new challenges, a long-term\nstrategic plan must be established first. Mission objectives\nmust be clearly defined to drive the forward path. If the goal is\nto remediate the environment, then four critical \xe2\x80\x9cCs\xe2\x80\x9d will be\nneeded at the international level. The first \xe2\x80\x9cC\xe2\x80\x9d stands for the\nconsensus on ADR. The second \xe2\x80\x9cC\xe2\x80\x9d is for cooperation \xe2\x80\x93 the\nremoval target may belong to a different country. The third\n\xe2\x80\x9cC\xe2\x80\x9d is for collaboration \xe2\x80\x93 it is highly unlikely that any single\norganization or country can accomplish the goal by itself. The\nlast \xe2\x80\x9cC\xe2\x80\x9d stands for contributions \xe2\x80\x93 cost-sharing will be the key\nfor using ADR to preserve the environment for future\ngenerations.\n\nOrbital\xc2\xa0Lifetime\xc2\xa0of\xc2\xa0a\xc2\xa0Typical\xc2\xa0SL\xe2\x80\x908\xc2\xa02nd\xc2\xa0Stage\xc2\xa0(950\xc2\xa0km,\xc2\xa083\xc2\xb0)\n7500\n\n>200 years\n7300\n\nSemimajor\xc2\xa0Axis\xc2\xa0(km)\n\n11 years\n\n25 years\nActual\xc2\xa0A/M\xc2\xa0(0.015\xc2\xa0m2/kg)\n\n7100\n\nEnhanced\xc2\xa0A/M,\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa00.4\xc2\xa0m2/kg\n\n2 years\n\nEnhanced\xc2\xa0A/M,\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa01.4\xc2\xa0m2/kg\nEnhanced\xc2\xa0A/M,\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa05.5\xc2\xa0m2/kg\n\n\xe2\x86\x92 ~27 m balloon\n\xe2\x86\x92 ~50 m balloon\n\xe2\x86\x92 ~100 m balloon\n\n6900\n\nReferences\n6700\n\n1)\n\n6500\n2010\n\n2015\n\n2020\n\n2025\n\n2030\n\n2035\n\n2040\n\n2045\n\n2050\n\n2055\n\n2060\n\n2)\n\nYear\n\nFig.8.
