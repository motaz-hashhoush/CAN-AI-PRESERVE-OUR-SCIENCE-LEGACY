The interface adapter is comprised of\nseveral main components, including an RF signaling\nreceiver, a microcontroller and associated circuitry for\ndecoding and processing the received signals, and programmable impedance matching and line interfacing circuitry for\ninterfacing a wireless communications headset system base\nto a communications system. A signaling transmitter, which\nis preferably portable (e.g., handheld), is employed by the\nwireless headset user to send signals to the signaling\nreceiver. In an embodiment of the invention directed specifically to push-to-talk (PTT) signaling, the wireless headset user presses a button on the signaling transmitter when\nthey wish to speak. This sends a signal to the microcontroller\nwhich decodes the signal and recognizes the signal as being\na PTT request. In response, the microcontroller generates a\ncontrol signal that closes a switch to complete a voice\nconnection between the headset system base and the communications system so that the user can communicate with\nthe communications system. With this arrangement, the\nwireless headset can be interfaced to any communications\nsystem that requires PTT signaling, without modification of\nthe headset device. In addition, the interface adapter can also\nbe configured to respond to or deliver any other types of\nsignals, such as dual-tone-multiple-frequency (DTMF)\ntones, and onloff hook signals. The present invention is also\nscalable, and permits multiple wireless users to operate\nindependently in the same environment through use of a\nplurality of the interface adapters.\n\n18 Claims, 4 Drawing Sheets\n\nU S .

First and second capacitors C1 and C2 are used to\nremove undesired signal components from the voice signals\npassing to the impedance matching and interface circuit 22.\nIn this embodiment, the microcontroller 18 is preferably\na 16-bit microprocessor, such as a model PIC 16F84-()4/P, 5s\nand receives encoded signaling messages from the signaling\nreceiver 16 through the connector J1. microcontroller 18\nThe\ndecodes the received signaling messages and sends control\nsignals to the impedance matching and line interfacing\nif the encoded message from the 60\ncircuit 22, F~~\ncontrol signal router and power supply 120 is a \xe2\x80\x9c P T y\nrequest message, the microcontroller 18 issues a voltage out\nto a relay 125 through an output port 126 (pin 18) to initiate\na switch closure.
