Even after such large bodies formed, the bulk of the mass of the future terrestrial planet zone resided in small bodies. Subsequent evolution is difficult to model because it requires simultaneous consideration of continuum (multitudinous small bodies) and discrete (a few large bodies) evolution. Some relevant issues include definition of accretional feeding zones, evaluation of the range of gravitational influence, viscous transport and diffusion, orbital commensurabilities, role of gas, etc. The first large bodies may have been (1) the embryos of the final planets, which grew by accreting tiny planetesimals, or (2) merely the first of many 1000+ km bodies, which grew independently and later collided to form the planets. Models of late stage accretion that assume all bodies to be initially nearly Moon sized provide insight into relevant collisional and dynamical processes. The chief point in this research is that the correct size distribution during the later stages of planet growth remains unknown.", "title": "Late-stage planetesimals:  How big?", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-12T09:21:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19850025544, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Greenberg, R."}, "organization": {"name": "Planetary Science Inst.", "location": "Tucson, AZ, United States"}}, "id": "015a6c8776b74431999bab4548a58440"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19850025544, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Davis, D.
