The perihelion goal of 4 solar radii requires a shielded spacecraft that can tolerate the 3000 suns solar flux while maintaining the electronics components at room temperature.  In addition, the shield surface should sublimate at a rate of less than 3 mg/s at perihelion.  Many shield configuration designs have been studied and the most promising is a parabolic shape that functions as both a shield and a large high gain antenna.  The shield material chosen for this design is a carbon-carbon material with highly emissive surface properties.  A mission requirement for a high telecommunications power stems from the expected interference when attempting to transmit data through the solar corona.  It is expected that the large carbon-carbon shield/antenna will have a large power gain even at high temperatures and will return adequate telemetry at the X-band radio frequency chosen for the Solar Probe mission.  Other key technology needs include a non-nuclear power subsystem that can function in the extreme environments of the mission from Earth to Jupiter and onward to a 4 solar radii perihelion.", "title": "Solar Probe Technology Challenges", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20210004073, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Randolph, James E."}}, "id": "aeca31a8cc25451f8eb69e575759eda6"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "NOT_SET", "modified": "2022-09-30T04:36:11.3610150+00:00", "id": 20210004073, "sourceIdentifiers": [{"number": "2014/32061", "type": "HANDLE"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20210004073, "id": "75a42098157a490ba57b0680dd4f5760", "publicationDate": "1995-10-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
