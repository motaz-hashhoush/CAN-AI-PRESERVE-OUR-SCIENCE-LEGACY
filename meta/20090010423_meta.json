It reveals the progress we have made, our plans for the near future, and our opportunity to support the Agency's Mission to \"explore the universe and search for life.\" Space science has made spectacular advances in the recent past, from the first baby pictures of the universe to the discovery of water ice on Mars. Each new discovery impels us to ask new questions or regard old ones in new ways. How did the universe begin? How did life arise? Are we alone? These questions continue to inspire all of us to keep exploring and searching. And, as we get closer to answers, we will continue to share our findings with the science community, educators, and the public as broadly and as rapidly as possible. In this Strategy, you will find science objectives that define NASA's quest for discovery. You will also find the framework of programs, such as flight missions and ground-based research, that will enable us to achieve these objectives. This Strategy is founded on recommendations from the community, as well as lessons learned from past programs, and maps the stepping-stones to the future of space science.", "title": "Space Science Enterprise Strategy", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-24T17:32:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other - NASA Publication (NP)", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-09-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20090010423, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20090010423, "id": "c3747050741448fcb767f7f300d1ef84", "publicationDate": "2003-10-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20090010423.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20090010423/downloads/20090010423.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20090010423/downloads/20090010423.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20090010423/downloads/20090010423.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
