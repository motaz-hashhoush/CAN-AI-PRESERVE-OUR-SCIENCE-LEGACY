A list of items which have hindered the progress of the\ninvestigation follows:\n1) as stated in the last ERTS I progress report, there is a\nneed for additional DCP\'s for deployment in the Everglades\nBasin to acquire the additional data needed to complete a\nwater budget analysis. There is also a need for spare\nprogram boards to allow the present stations to maintain\ncontinuous operations.\n2) during this reporting period, fires have burned uncontrolled\nin the Big Cypress Swamp, the Everglades National Park, and the\nwater conservation areas. In Water Con. 6 i`vation Area 3A, some\nof the supports for the structure containing a DCP and related\nequipment were burned away leaving the structure hanging precariously. Fortunately the DCP which was closer to the fire\nthan otter equipment was insulated by three inches of sand and\nwas unharmed.\n3) a station in Water Conservation Area 2A has been shot by\ngunfire several times. The DCP has not been hit but recorders,\nrainfall reservoir, and shelters have been damaged.\n4) imagery provided to user 1414 has been arriving in Miami\nintermittently.\nd. 1) during the reporting period, three new stations have\nbeen installed to monitor precipitation and upstream and\ndownstream water stage at water controls. The head difference\nbetween the upstream/downstream stage status are used to\n\n.r\t\n\n_ \'j\n\ncalculate discharge through the controls. A sketch of one\nof the stations is shown in figure 1. The station shown in\nfigure 1 is operated in cooperation with the U. S. Corps of\nEngineers and located at S-12-C, a water control structure\nwhich regulates flow from Water Conservation Area 3A into the\nEverglades National Park. Installation of the station at the\nstructure involved the use of over 600 feet of multiconductor\ncable in order to link the digital, water-stage recorders\nwith the DCP. The DCP is located atop the control structure\nabout 15 feet above the ground. The twenty conductor cable\nis inside aluminum conduit above ground and inside plastic\npolyvinyl conduit below ground. The control structure provides\na good location for th^. DCP because it provides some protection\nfrom vandalism and is about halfway between the two recorders.\nThe housing for the DCP is strapped tc the guard rail atop\nthe control structure with the antenna mounted atop the housing.\nIncluded in the housing are the battery power, a rain gage,\nan environmental monitor, and the DCP. The environmental\nmonitor contains an electronic counter which is linked between\nthe rain gage and the DCP to count the tips by the rain gage.\nA rainfall receiver is mounted to one side of the housing.\nRainfall is fed to the rain gage inside the housing by a tube.\nIn addition to the 3 upstream/downstream and precipitation\nstations, 5 more stations are near completion in the Everglades\nNational Park. These stations will monitor rrecipitation and\nwater stage when they are installed but will be set up to add\nother parameters. The environmental monitor to be installed\nat each stnt\'.on can monitor other parameters as well as rainfall.\nThe environmontal monitor was designed by Ed Cordes of the\nMiami of:ice of the U. S. Geological Survey. Cordes is also\nworking on an improved solid state clock to be used with the DCP.\nMore work on rectification of ERTS imagery is being done with\nthe Bendix Corporation. The effort is aimed at quantifying\nvolumes of water with imagery.\nf. The following report has been approved for the third ERTS\nsymposium, NASA/Coddard Space Flight Center and more recently\nit was approved to be published in the proceedings of the\nEleventh Space Congress: "Water Management Models in Florida\nfrom I;TS-I Dtta" by A. L. Higer, A. E. Coker, and E. 11.
