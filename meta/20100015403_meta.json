HSD comprises approximately 299 scientists, technologists, and administrative personnel dedicated to the goal of advancing our knowledge and understanding of the Sun and the wide variety of domains that its variability influences. Our activities include: Leading science investigations involving flight hardware, theory, and data analysis and modeling that will answer the strategic questions posed in the Heliophysics Roadmap; Leading the development of new solar and space physics mission concepts and support their implementation as Project Scientists; Providing access to measurements from the Heliophysics Great Observatory through our Science Information Systems; and Communicating science results to the public and inspiring the next generation of scientists and explorers.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 20100015403, "id": "172b67e45aa24fcd8225313e93e72cc3", "publicationDate": "2009-02-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20100015403.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20100015403/downloads/20100015403.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20100015403/downloads/20100015403.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20100015403/downloads/20100015403.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
