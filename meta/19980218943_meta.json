For each flight, the following activities were accomplished: (1) prepare the experiment, including replacement and upgrading of critical components, at the University of Michigan; (2) integrate the payload either at the Wallops Flight Facility; (3) perform final far-UV calibration of instrument; (4) perform final alignment, integration, and electrical checks at WSMR (5) launch payload from WSMR (6) check condition of recovered payload (7) perform post-flight calibration, if necessary and applicable; and (8) reduce and analyze flight data. A description of the instrument is presented, along with overviews of the results of the four flights.
