Data from the 1950's through present day is reviewed for possible trends such as when in the launch timeline a failure occurred, which stages had the highest failure rate, overall launcher reliability, a decade by decade look at launcher reliability, when in a launchers history did failures occur, and the reliability of United States human-rated launchers. This information is useful in determining where launcher reliability can be improved and where additional measures for crew survival (i.e., Crew Escape systems) will have the greatest emphasis", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20100036606, "endDate": "2002-05-30T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "NASA Glenn Research Center", "location": "Cleveland, OH, United States"}}, "meetingId": "9cca30bdf8474533a93b75c75357a14f", "id": "2776a9261f13405cbedd26363b35c54e"}, {"meta": {"organization": {"name": "NASA Headquarters", "location": "Washington, DC, United States"}}, "meetingId": "9cca30bdf8474533a93b75c75357a14f", "id": "db0069e802b8495abd8a9eed49fd608a"}], "name": "2002 Assurance Technology Conference (5th)", "location": "Cleveland, OH", "id": "9cca30bdf8474533a93b75c75357a14f", "startDate": "2002-05-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20100036606, "id": "2fb3798c2cea49b39173f0e6627c5db5", "publicationDate": "2002-05-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20100036606.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20100036606/downloads/20100036606.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20100036606/downloads/20100036606.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20100036606/downloads/20100036606.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
