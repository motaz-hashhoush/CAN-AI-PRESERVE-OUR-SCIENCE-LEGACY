MCDAS facilitates and improves testing of complex engineering\nsystems by helping to perform calibration and setup of test systems and acquisition, dissemination, and processing of\ndata. Features of MCDAS include an intuitive, user-friendly graphical user interface, a capability for acquiring data at\nrates greater than previously possible,\n\ncooperation between the data-acquisition software subsystem and alarmchecking and analytical components of\nthe control software subsystem, and a\ncapability for dissemination of data\nthrough \xef\xac\x81ber optics and virtual and\nwide-area networks, including networks\nthat contain hand-held display units.\nThe integration of the data acquisition\nand control software offers a safety advantage by making alarm information\navailable to the control software in a\nmore timely manner. By enabling the\nuse of hand-held devices, MCDAS re-\n\nduces the time spent by technicians asking for screen updates to determine effects of setup actions. Previously\nrecorded data can be processed without\ninterruption to current acquisition of\ndata. Analysts can continue to view test\nparameters while test-data files are\nbeing generated.\nThis program was written by Rick Hall of\nMarshall Space Flight Center, Alice\nDaniel formerly of UNITes (NTSI), and\nFrank E. Batts, Sr. of Langley Research Center. Further information is contained in a\nTSP (see page 1). MFS-32014-1\n\nIMU/GPS System Provides Position and Attitude Data\nStennis Space Center, Mississippi\nA special navigation system is being developed to provide high-quality information on the position and attitude of a\nmoving platform (an aircraft or spacecraft), for use in pointing and stabilization of a hyperspectral remote-sensing\nsystem carried aboard the platform. The\nsystem also serves to enable synchronization and interpretation of readouts of all\nonboard sensors. The heart of the system\nis a commercially available unit, small\nenough to be held in one hand, that contains an integral combination of an inertial measurement unit (IMU) of the microelectromechanical systems (MEMS)\ntype, Global Positioning System (GPS)\n\nreceivers, a differential GPS subsystem,\nand ancillary data-processing subsystems.\nThe system utilizes GPS carrier-phase\nmeasurements to generate time data plus\nhighly accurate and continuous data on\nthe position, attitude, rotation, and acceleration of the platform. Relative to\nprior navigation systems based on IMU\nand GPS subsystems, this system is\nsmaller, is less expensive, and performs\nbetter. Optionally, the system can easily\nbe connected to a laptop computer for\ndemonstration and evaluation. In addition to airborne and spaceborne remotesensing applications, there are numerous potential terrestrial sensing,\n\nmeasurement, and navigation applications in diverse endeavors that include\nforestry, environmental monitoring, agriculture, mining, and robotics.\nThis work was done by Ching Fang Lin\nof American GNC Corp. for Stennis Space\nCenter.\nInquiries concerning rights for the commercial use of this invention should be addressed to:\nAmerican GNC Corporation\n888 Easy Street\nSimi Valley, CA 93065\nE-mail: c\xef\xac\x82in@americangnc.com\nRefer to SSC-00225, volume and number\nof this NASA Tech Briefs issue, and the\npage number.\n\nUsing Arti\xef\xac\x81cial Intelligence to Inform Pilots of Weather\nWeather awareness is increased; workload is reduced.\nAmes Research Center, Moffett Field, California\nAn automated system to assist a General Aviation (GA) pilot in improving\nsituational awareness of weather in\n\xef\xac\x82ight is now undergoing development.\nThis development is prompted by the\nobservation that most fatal GA accidents\nare attributable to loss of weather awareness. Loss of weather awareness, in\nturn, has been attributed to the diffi-\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 2006\n\nculty of interpreting traditional preflight weather briefings and the difficulty of both obtaining and interpreting traditional in-\xef\xac\x82ight weather brie\xef\xac\x81ngs.\nThe developmental automated system\nnot only improves weather awareness\nbut also substantially reduces the time a\npilot must spend in acquiring and maintaining weather awareness.\n\nThe automated system includes computer hardware and software, a speechbased hardware/software user interface,\nand hardware interfaces between the\ncomputer and aircraft radio-communication equipment. The heart of the system consists of arti\xef\xac\x81cial-intelligence software,\ncalled\nAviation\nWeather\nEnvironment (AWE), that implements a\n\n5\n\nCurrent Weather and Winds Aloft are shown alongside a pilot-selected route. Wind velocity at the\npilot-selected altitude is depicted graphically with black arrows. The current weather is shown using\nsymbolic and textual representations.\n\nhuman-centered methodology oriented\ntowards providing the weather information (1) that the pilot needs and/or\nwants, (2) at the appropriate time, and\n(3) in the appropriate format.\nAWE can be characterized as a context-aware, domain-and-task knowledgeable, personalized, adaptive assistant.\n\nAWE automatically monitors weather reports for the pilot\xe2\x80\x99s \xef\xac\x82ight route and\nARC-14970-1\nABPI\nwarns the pilot of any weatherEM\ncondi12-01-04\ntions outside the limits of acceptable\nweather conditions that the pilot has\nspeci\xef\xac\x81ed in advance. AWE provides textual and/or graphical representations\nof important weather elements overlaid\n\non a navigation map (see \xef\xac\x81gure). The\nrepresentations depict current and forecast conditions in an easy-to-interpret\nmanner and are geographically positioned next to each applicable airport\nto enable the pilot to visualize conditions along the route. In addition to automatic warnings, the system enables\nthe pilot to verbally request (via the\nspeech-based user interface) weather\nand airport information.\nAWE is context-aware in the following sense: From the location of the aircraft (as determined by a Global Positioning System receiver) and the route\nas specified by the pilot, AWE determines the phase of flight. In determining the timing of warnings and the\nmanner in which warnings are issued,\nAWE takes account of the phase of\nflight, the pilot\xe2\x80\x99s definition of acceptable weather conditions, and the pilot\xe2\x80\x99s\npreferences for automatic notification.\nBy noting the pilot\xe2\x80\x99s verbal requests for\ninformation during the various phases\nof flight, the system learns to provide\nthe information, without explicit requests, at the corresponding times on\nsubsequent flights under similar conditions.\nThis work was done by Lilly Spirkovska of\nAmes Research Center and Suresh K.\nLodha of the University of California. Further information is contained in a TSP (see\npage 1).\nInquiries concerning rights for the commercial use of this invention should be addressed to the Patent Counsel, Ames Research Center, (650) 604-5104.

This algorithm is intended for use in compressing multispectral-image data aboard\nspacecraft for transmission to Earth stations. Variants of this algorithm could\nbe useful for lossless compression of\nthree-dimensional medical imagery\nand, perhaps, for compressing image\ndata in general.\nThe main adaptive-\xef\xac\x81ltering algorithm\non which the present algorithm is based\nis the sign algorithm (also known as the\n\n6\n\nsign-error algorithm and as the binary\nreinforcement algorithm). The sign algorithm is related to the least-meansquare (LMS) algorithm. Both algorithms are briefly described in the\nfollowing two paragraphs.\nConsider a sequence of image data\n(or any other data) that one seeks to\ncompress. The sequence is speci\xef\xac\x81ed in\nterms of a sequentially increasing index\n(k) and the value (d k) of the kth sample.\n\xcb\x86\nAn estimated value of the kth sample, dk,\nis calculated by the equation\n\xcb\x86\ndk = wT uk ,\nk\nwhere wk is a filter-weight vector at\n\nindex k and uk is an input vector that\ncan be de\xef\xac\x81ned in any of a number of\ndifferent ways, depending on the spe\xcb\x86\nci\xef\xac\x81c application. Once the estimate dk\nhas been calculated, the error between\nthe estimate and the exact value is calculated as\n\xcb\x86\nek = dk \xe2\x80\x93 d k.\nWhen the LMS algorithm or sign algorithm is used as part of a predictive compression scheme, the sequence of ek values is encoded in the compressed\nbitstream.\nThe error value is also used to update\nthe \xef\xac\x81lter weights in either of two ways, de-\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 2006\n\npending on which algorithm is in use. In\nthe LMS algorithm, the update equation is\nwk+1 = wk \xe2\x80\x93 \xc2\xb5ukek.\nIn the sign algorithm, the update equation is\nwk+1 = wk \xe2\x80\x93 \xc2\xb5uksgn(ek).\nIn both update equations, \xc2\xb5 is a positive, scalar step-size parameter that\ncontrols the trade-off between convergence speed and average steady-state\nerror. A smaller value of \xc2\xb5 results in\nbetter steady-state performance but\nslower convergence. In some variants\nof these algorithms, the value of \xc2\xb5\nchanges over time.\nIn the present algorithm, the index k\nis taken as an abstract representation of\nthree indices (x,y,z) that are the coordinates of the sample in the multispectral\ndataset. Speci\xef\xac\x81cally, x and y are the spatial coordinates and z denotes the spectral band. The signal level (equivalently,\nthe sample value) for that location is\nrepresented by dk \xe2\x89\xa1 s(x,y,z).\nFor purposes of compression, an image\nrepresented by a stream of data to be compressed is partitioned spatially into conve-\n\nniently sized, \xef\xac\x81xed regions. The data are\ncompressed in the order in which they are\nreceived, maintaining separate statistics for\neach band and switching among the bands\nas necessary. The data from each region are\ncompressed independently of those from\nother regions. Performing independent\ncompression calculations for each region\nlimits the adverse effect of loss of data.\nThe input vector uk chosen for this algorithm contains values from a six-sample prediction neighborhood of a sample of interest: three values from\nadjacent samples in the same spectral\nband and one sample each from the\nsame location in each of three preceding spectral bands.

The stream of ek values calculated by use of this uk is further compressed by use of Golomb\ncodes.\nIn tests, the compression effectiveness of this algorithm was shown to\nbe competitive with that of the best\npreviously reported data-compression algorithms of similar complexity.

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nPattern Interpretation and Recognition\nApplication Toolkit Environment (PIRATE) is a block-oriented software system\nthat aids the development of application\nprograms that analyze signals in real time\nin order to recognize signal patterns that\nare indicative of conditions or events of interest. PIRATE was originally intended for\nuse in writing application programs to recognize patterns in space-shuttle telemetry\nsignals received at Johnson Space Center\xe2\x80\x99s\nMission Control Center: application programs were sought to (1) monitor electric\ncurrents on shuttle ac power busses to recognize activations of speci\xef\xac\x81c power-consuming devices, (2) monitor various pressures and infer the states of affected\nsystems by applying a Kalman \xef\xac\x81lter to the\npressure signals, (3) determine fuel-leak\nrates from sensor data, (4) detect faults in\ngyroscopes through analysis of system\nmeasurements in the frequency domain,\nand (5) determine drift rates in inertial\nmeasurement units by regressing measurements against time. PIRATE can also be\nused to develop signal-pattern-recognition\nsoftware for different purposes \xe2\x80\x94 for example, to monitor and control manufacturing processes.\nPIRATE was preceded by a custom\nstripchart-analysis program that took a\nlong time to develop and offered little\nopportunity for reuse. Also available\nprior to the development of PIRATE\nwere commercial block-oriented development software systems that were useful\nfor prototyping but exhibited signi\xef\xac\x81cant\nlimitations: for example, they could not\nbe used to produce real-time application\nprograms, could not be used to develop\nsoftware compatible with the hardware\nand the other software of the Mission\nControl Center, could not be used to develop application programs that could\nfunction in the face of the communication dif\xef\xac\x81culties (especially, intermittency\nand errors) inherent in monitoring remote equipment, and could not provide\npattern-recognition capabilities. PIRATE\novercomes these de\xef\xac\x81ciencies to a large\nextent, and goes beyond that by including a C-language interface that provides\nunprecedented \xef\xac\x82exibility.\nPIRATE includes the following components:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The PIRATE data-\xef\xac\x82ow language. An application program is speci\xef\xac\x81ed by use of\nthe PIRATE data-flow language. An\n\n8\n\napplication-program speci\xef\xac\x81cation de\xef\xac\x81nes which data processing modules\nwill be used in the program and establishes the data flowing among the\nmodules. Similarly, for building a\nmodule, one speci\xef\xac\x81es the \xef\xac\x82ow of data\ninto and out of a module by use of the\nPIRATE language.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The PIRATE prede\xef\xac\x81ned modules. PIRATE\ncontains several prede\xef\xac\x81ned modules,\nincluding ones for data communication,\nsignal processing, and data \xef\xac\x81ltering.\nAmong these are software tools to \xef\xac\x81lter\nout the highly non-Gaussian errors that\nare typical of the communication\nprocess while leaving the nonerroneous\ndata intact. (Most other signal-processing software \xef\xac\x81lters that can remove nonGaussian errors also undesirably modify\nthe underlying signals.) Also among the\nprede\xef\xac\x81ned modules are a Bayesian classi\xef\xac\x81er and other software tools for interpreting the contents of signals.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The PIRATE code generator. The PIRATE\ncode generator translates an application-program-speci\xef\xac\x81cation \xef\xac\x81le and the\nassociated module-con\xef\xac\x81guration \xef\xac\x81les\ninto a standard C-language \xef\xac\x81le. This\n\xef\xac\x81le contains the main routine for the\napplication program. A C compiler can\nthen compile and link this \xef\xac\x81le to produce an efficient real-time patternrecognition application program.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The PIRATE object library. The generated code makes calls to several PIRATE infrastructure routines.

However, the standard imake\nsuite explicitly targets the construction of X Window System software.\nThe PIRATE imake facility takes advantage of the standard imake suite\nwhere practical, but targets the construction of PIRATE and PIRATE application programs rather than X Window System software.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 An architecture for the development of modules by the user. PIRATE is intentionally\nan open-ended software tool. While\n\nsimple application programs can be\nconstructed by use of the prede\xef\xac\x81ned\nmodules, it is likely that a useful pattern-recognition application programs\ncould not. Instead, domain-specific\nlogic can be expected to be necessary.\nPIRATE enables the implementation\nof domain-speci\xef\xac\x81c knowledge in the\nwidely used C programming language.\nThe architecture for user-developed\nmodules speci\xef\xac\x81es how such domain\nknowledge can be used in a PIRATE\napplication program.\nPIRATE is used both in building a pattern-recognition application program\nand in the real-time execution of that\nprogram. To build an application program, one constructs an applicationspecification file, application-specific\nmodules, and application imake \xef\xac\x81le.\nThe imake \xef\xac\x81le identi\xef\xac\x81es the components that form the executable application program and directs construction\nof these components from the source\n\xef\xac\x81les developed by the user.\nDuring execution of the patternrecognition application program, the\nsource module of the program acquires\nthe incoming data and uses the PIRATE\ninfrastructure to feed the data to downstream modules. The infrastructure\nsends the appropriate data to the appropriate modules, which operate on the\ndata. Each module uses the PIRATE infrastructure to send its output to modules downstream of it.\nIn PIRATE, transmission of data between data-processing modules is always\nperformed by calls to C functions that\nare parts of an executable module. In\nother software systems, data are often\ntransmitted between modules via operating systems; the computational overhead\nof doing so is often several orders of\nmagnitude greater than that of PIRATE.\nIn PIRATE, the processing of data within\na module is performed by compiled\nfunctions. In other systems, the processing of data may be performed by interpreters, which, again entail computational overhead much greater than that\nof PIRATE.\nThis program was written by Robert O.\nShelton of Johnson Space Center and\nDavid Hammen of LinCom.

This technology primarily addresses domains that contain arrays that\nhave regular index sets with the lowlevel implementation details being beyond the scope of this discussion. The\ntheoretical foundations are based upon\nthe work \xe2\x80\x9cA Semantic Framework for\nDomains, Arrays, and Distributions in\nChapel\xe2\x80\x9d by Hans Zima. What is de\xef\xac\x81ned\nis a complete set of object-oriented operators that allows one to perform data\ndistributions for domain arrays involving regular arithmetic index sets. What\nis unique is that these operators allow\nfor the arbitrary regions of the arrays to\nbe fragmented and distributed across\nmultiple processors with a single point\nof access giving the programmer the illusion that all the elements are collocated on a single processor.

Locality of access as well as load\nbalancing are primary concerns in these\nsystems that are typically used for highperformance scientific computation.\nData distributions address these issues\nby providing a range of methods for\nspreading large data sets across the\ncomponents of a system. Over the past\ntwo decades, many languages, systems,\ntools, and libraries have been developed\nfor the support of distributions. Since\nthe performance of data parallel applications is directly in\xef\xac\x82uenced by the distribution strategy, users often resort to\nlow-level programming models that\nallow \xef\xac\x81ne-tuning of the distribution aspects affecting performance, but, at the\nsame time, are tedious and error-prone.\nThis technology presents a reusable de-\n\nsign of a data-distribution framework\nfor data parallel high-performance applications. Distributions are a means to\nexpress locality in systems composed of\nlarge numbers of processor and memory components connected by a network. Since distributions have a great efon\nthe\nperformance\nof\nfect\napplications, it is important that the distribution strategy is \xef\xac\x82exible, so its behavior can change depending on the\nneeds of the application.

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nFigure 1 depicts a switching circuit\nthat drives a piezoelectric pump at a\nhigh voltage with a polarity that alternates at the desired mechanical pump\nfrequency. This circuit offers advantages\nof (1) high energy ef\xef\xac\x81ciency relative to\nconventional direct-drive circuits and\n(2) compactness relative to conventional\nresonant drive circuits.\nConventional direct-drive circuits are\ninef\xef\xac\x81cient because the piezoelectric actuators in the pump behave electrically\nas large capacitors and consume only a\nsmall part of the energy supplied to them\nduring each pump cycle. Conventional\nresonant drive circuits are more ef\xef\xac\x81cient, but they must include inductive\ncoils, which can be unacceptably large.\nThe present switching drive circuit includes inductive coils, but they are small\nand not used to resonate the actuator capacitance; instead, the charging of the\n\nactuator capacitances and the exchanges of energy among inductive and\ncapacitive circuit elements are accomplished (by design) in times much\nshorter than the mechanical pump\ncycle. In other words, this drive circuit\nrapidly charges the actuator capacitance\nand turns itself off until the actuators\nreach their maximum mechanical expansion or contraction. Some time after\nthe actuators reach their maximum mechanical expansion or contraction, the\ncircuit turns itself back on to charge the\nactuator capacitance in the opposite polarity; as it does so, it replenishes the energy lost since the previous charge.\nWhen power is \xef\xac\x81rst turned on, the capacitance of the piezoelectric actuators\n(C2 in Figure 1) is \xef\xac\x81rst charged to a potential of +450 V via transistor Q2. The charging current and, hence, charging time are\ndetermined by the characteristics of the\n\ndc-to-dc converter and the characteristics\nof the piezoelectric \xef\xac\x81lms. Inductor L1 is\nused to reduce the initial current spike\nduring each recharge cycle, and C1 is\nused to stabilize the output voltage of the\nconverter as well as reduce the peak output current demand on the dc-to-dc converter. Inductor L2 is the main energystorage inductor; it is used to exchange\nenergy with C2 for switching polarity, as\ndescribed in more detail below.\nThe timing signals that govern the operation of this circuit are transistor/ transistor-logic (TTL)-level pulses with a duration of 5 ms and a repetition frequency\nequal to the desired pump frequency (20\nHz in the original design). The short\npulse duration is necessary in order to enable the triac (Q2) to turn itself off when\nthe current in inductor L2 reaches zero.\nThe timing signal is generated by timing/control oscillator U6, which supplies\n\n450 Vdc\nU1\n3\n+IN +OUT\n2\n4\n\xe2\x80\x93IN \xe2\x80\x93OUT\ndc-to-dc Converter\n\nLC Tank\n\n1\n\n+28 Vdc\n\nC1\n36 \xc2\xb5F\n\nS1 Power\n\nL1\nR1\n\nD1\nR2\n1 M\xe2\x84\xa6\n\nOn\n8 Vdc\n\nU3\nLM7606\n\nVOUT\nR6\n100 \xe2\x84\xa6\nR7\n\n8 Vdc\n\n100 \xe2\x84\xa6\n\nU5A\nLM324\n3 +\n2\n\n5\n\n11\nR13\n10 k\xe2\x84\xa6\n\n6\n\nOpto Driver\n\n1\n\n2\n\nTD1\n\nTD2\nU5B\nLM324\n\n+\n\n7\n\nR11\n47 k\xe2\x84\xa6\n\n8 Vdc\n\nTiming Control/Oscillator\nR10\n100 \xe2\x84\xa6\n\n\xe2\x80\x93\nU6A\n\n11\n\n14\n3\n6\n2\n4\n\nS2 Start Switch\n1\n3 Run\n\n2\n5\n\nOpto-Isolator\n\nC3\n0.0002 \xe2\x84\xa6F\n\n8 Vdc\n\nD2\n1N4000\n\nTD2\n\n150 \xe2\x84\xa6\n\nOpto Isolator\n\nR9\n10 k\xe2\x84\xa6\n\n1\n\n\xe2\x80\x93\n\n3\n\nR5\n\nR4\n10 k\xe2\x84\xa6\n\n7\n8\nU2\n\n1\n\nR3\n1.5 k\xe2\x84\xa6\n\nF8\n\n6\n\n3\n\nGround\n\nR8\n1 k\xe2\x84\xa6\n\n2\n\n1N4007\n\n5\n\n2\n\nC2\n\nQ2\nMAC223\n\n1 k\xe2\x84\xa6\n\nOff\n\nVIN\n\nPiezoelectric\nActuator\n\nL2\nQ1\nIRFBG30\n2\n3\n\n4 Start\n6\n\nFB R15\n\n8 Vdc\n\nC6\n\nVCC\nCON\nTRG\nTHRES\nRST\n\nU6B\n\nOUT 5\nDIS 1\nGND 7\n\n11\n5\n12\n10\n\n556\nR14\nC7\n0.02 \xc2\xb5F\n\nC5\n0.1 \xc2\xb5F\n\nCON\nTRG\nTHRES\nRST\n\n556\n\nR12\n200 \xe2\x84\xa6\n\n9\nOUT 13\nDIS\n\nC4\n0.1 \xc2\xb5F\n\n1 M\xe2\x84\xa6\n\nReplenish Control\n\nFigure 1.

To minimize size of, and\npower dissipation in, a multicolor pixel,\none must minimize the number of transistors and control signals; this can be\nachieved only by time multiplexing of\n\ncolors in each pixel. The time multiplexing can be controlled by signals from external or internal circuitry. The proposed reliance on external control for\ntime multiplexing would make it possible to use a commercial single-color\nROIC with only minor modi\xef\xac\x81cations in\nthe form of extra metallization for an additional detector common plane and for\nclocking bias potentials.

Several prior visual-tracker programs have been tested on\nrover platforms; most require very small\nand well-estimated motion between consecutive image frames \xe2\x80\x94 a requirement\nthat is not realistic for a rover on rough\nterrain. The present visual-tracker program is designed to handle large image\nmotions that lead to signi\xef\xac\x81cant changes in\nfeature geometry and photometry between frames. When a point is selected in\none of the images acquired from stereoscopic cameras on the mast, a stereo triangulation algorithm computes a three-dimensional (3D) location for the target. As\nthe rover moves, its body-mounted cameras feed images to a visual-odometry algorithm, which tracks two-dimensional (2D)\ncorner features and computes their old\nand new 3D locations. The algorithm rejects points, the 3D motions of which are\ninconsistent with a rigid-world constraint,\nand then computes the apparent change\nin the rover pose (i.e., translation and rotation). The mast pan and tilt angles\nneeded to keep the target centered in the\n\xef\xac\x81eld-of-view of the cameras (thereby minimizing the area over which the 2D-tracking algorithm must operate) are computed from the estimated change in the\nrover pose, the 3D position of the target\nfeature, and a model of kinematics of the\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 2006\n\nmast. If the motion between the consecutive frames is still large (i.e., 3D tracking\nwas unsuccessful), an adaptive view-based\nmatching technique is applied to the new\nimage. This technique uses correlationbased template matching, in which a feature template is scaled by the ratio between the depth in the original template\nand the depth of pixels in the new image.\nThis is repeated over the entire search window and the best correlation results indicate the appropriate match.

The vacuum gaps are\nneeded to electrically insulate the legs\nfrom each other. The process involves the\nuse of scaffolding in the form of sheets of\na polymer to temporarily separate the\nlegs by the desired distance, which is typically about 0.5 mm. During a bonding\nsubprocess that would take place in a partial vacuum at an elevated temperature,\nthe polymer would be vaporized, thereby\ncreating the vacuum gaps. If desired, the\ngaps could later be \xef\xac\x81lled with an aerogel\nfor thermal insulation and to suppress\nsublimation of thermoelectric material,\nas described in \xe2\x80\x9cAerogels for Thermal Insulation of Thermoelectric Devices\xe2\x80\x9d\n(NPO-40630), NASA Tech Briefs, Vol. 30,\nNo. 7 (July, 2006), page 50.\nA simple thermoelectric module\nwould typically include thermoelectric\nlegs stacked perpendicularly between\nmetal contact pads on two ceramic substrates (see \xef\xac\x81gure). As the design of the\nthermoelectric module and the fabrication process are now envisioned, the\nmetal contact pads on the ceramic substrates would be coated with a suitable\nbonding metal (most likely, titanium),\nand the thermoelectric legs would be\nterminated in a possibly different bonding metal (most likely, molybdenum).\nPrior to stacking of the thermoelectric\npads between the metal pads on the ceramic substrates, the polymer sheets\nwould be bonded to the appropriate\nsides of the thermoelectric legs. After\nstacking, the resulting sandwich structure would be subjected to uniaxial pressure during heating in a partial vacuum\nto a temperature greater than 700 \xc2\xb0C.\nThe heating would bond the metal pads\non the legs to the metal pads on the substrates and would vaporize the polymer\nsheets.

Glenn Research Center, Cleveland, Ohio\nAn improved process for making\nnanocrystallites, commonly denoted\nquantum dots (QDs), is based on spray\npyrolysis. Unlike the process used heretofore, the improved process is amenable\nto mass production of either passivated\nor non-passivated QDs, with computer\ncontrol to ensure near uniformity of size.\nThe extraordinary optical properties\nthat make QDs useful can be tailored via\nthe chemical compositions and sizes of\nthe QDs. Heretofore, QDs have been\nmade by in situ pyrolysis of molecular\nreagents that contain all the elemental ingredients. In order to make all QDs in a\nbatch have the same or nearly the same\nsize, it is necessary to prevent nucleation\nwith adjacent QDs by passivating the surfaces of the QDs soon after they have\nformed. Passivation is effected by use of a\npassivating coordinating solvent/ligand\ncompound as one of the ingredients. This\ncompound both serves as a medium for\nthe formation of the QDs via pyrolysis\nand readily coordinates to the surfaces\nof the QDs, thereby preventing further\nnucleation. Covering of the surfaces of\nthe QDs with the coordinating molecular groups is known in the art as capping.\nThe\ncapping\ngroups\ncan be organic or inorganic. The solvent/ligand can be formulated to tailor\nthe surface properties of the QDs for a\nspeci\xef\xac\x81c application. For example, they\ncan be made hydrophilic or hydrophobic. Unfortunately, this in situ pyrolysis\nprocess cannot readily be scaled up to\nmass production, and the QDs produced exhibit excessive nonuniformity.\nThe improved process also includes py-\n\n18\n\nSyringe Pump\nContaining\nUltrasonic\nPrecursor Solution\nNozzle\n\nArgon\nSupply\n\nOutlet to\nCold Traps\nAPPARATUS FOR MAKING\nUNCAPPED QUANTUM DOTS\n\nSyringe Pump\nContaining\nPrecursor Solution\nArgon\nSupply\n\nUltrasonic\nNozzle\nTo\nBubbler and\nTraps\n\nHot Passivating\nSolution\nAPPARATUS FOR MAKING\nCAPPED QUANTUM DOTS\n\nThese Two Apparatuses serve to illustrate the basic principles of two variants of the spray-pyrolysis\nprocess for making uncapped or capped QDs of controlled size.\nLEW-17444\n\nrolysis, but differs from the prior process\nin the pyrolysis conditions and in the\nmanner in which the ingredients are prepared for pyrolysis. In addition, one has\nan option to form QDs of controlled size\nwithout or with capping. Unlike in the\nprior process, one does not rely on formulation and pyrolysis process conditions\nto cause the QDs to form spontaneously\nin the desired size range. Instead, one\nforces the QDs to form in a desired relatively narrow size range by spraying a solution of QD-precursor material through an\nultrasonic nozzle to form drops of controlled size. The average size of the drops\ncan be tailored via the surface tension\nand density of the solution. Even more\nconveniently, the average size can be tailored via the frequency of ultrasonic agitation. Experiments have shown that for a\ngiven formulation, the average size is inversely proportional to frequency to the\n2/3 power.\n\nABPI\n\nes\nThe basic concept of 11-18-03\nthe improved\nprocess admits of variations. For example, in a simple embodiment of the\nprocess for making non-capped QDs, a\nprecursor solution is sprayed into a coldwall reactor that contains a substrate that\nis electrically heated to the desired reaction temperature (see \xef\xac\x81gure). The drops\nfalling on the substrate become pyrolized\ninto QDs. In a slightly more complex example, capped QDs are made by similar\nspraying of a precursor solution into a\nhot passivating solvent.\nThis work was done by Kulbinder Banger,\nMichael H.

The PAARV also could be\nadapted for use on Earth in similar exploration of cold environments in and\nnear Arctic and Antarctic oceans and\nglacial and sub-glacial lakes.\nThe PAARV design is based partly on\nthe design of prior ice-penetrating exploratory robots and partly on the designs of drop sondes heretofore used on\nEarth for scienti\xef\xac\x81c and military purposes.\nLike a sonde, the PAARV is designed to\nbe connected to a carrier vehicle (e.g., a\nballoon, aircraft, or vessel in a terrestrial\nsetting) by a tether, through which the\ncarrier vehicle would provide power\nand would relay data communications\nbetween the PAARV and an external or\nremote control station. Like a sonde, the\nPAARV could be lowered from the carrier\nvehicle into an ocean or lake environment to be explored. Unlike a sonde, the\nPAARV would be capable of swimming\nand of crawling along the bottom, and\ncrawling out of the ocean or lake and\nmoving to a designated site of scienti\xef\xac\x81c\ninterest on the shore.\nAs now envisioned, the fully developed PAARV (see figure) would include an upper sonde segment and a\nlower sonde segment. Protruding from\nthe lower sonde segment would be two\nassemblies containing both lifting surfaces (for control of attitude during descent and swimming) and crawler\ntracks. These assemblies could be rotated to align them parallel, perpendicular, or at an oblique angle with respect to the longitudinal axis of the\nlower sonde segment. Also protruding\nfrom the lower sonde segment, at a\npoint above the center of gravity, would\nbe a thruster for swimming.\nThe upper sonde segment would be\ncylindrical, approximately 30 cm in diam-\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 2006\n\neter and 20 cm high.

The corer can be instrumented\nwith a variety of sensors (and/or the\ndrill bit or corer can be used as an\nacoustic-impedance sensor) for both\nprobing the drilled material and acquiring feedback for control of the excitation. The USDC advances into the material of interest by means of a\nhammering action and a resulting chiseling action at the tip of the corer. The\nhammering and chiseling actions are so\neffective that unlike in conventional\ntwist drilling, a negligible amount of\naxial force is needed to make the USDC\nadvance into the material.

Glenn Research Center, Cleveland, Ohio\nAn extrusion batch process for manufacturing regularly shaped sol-gel pellets has\nbeen devised as an improved alternative to\na spray process that yields irregularly\nshaped pellets. The aspect ratio of regularly\nshaped pellets can be controlled more easily, while regularly shaped pellets pack\nmore ef\xef\xac\x81ciently. In the extrusion process, a\nwet gel is pushed out of a mold and\nchopped repetitively into short, cylindrical\npieces as it emerges from the mold. The\npieces are collected and can be either (1)\ndried at ambient pressure to xerogel, (2)\nsolvent exchanged and dried under ambient pressure to ambigels, or (3) supercritically dried to aerogel. Advantageously, the\nextruded pellets can be dropped directly in\na cross-linking bath, where they develop a\nconformal polymer coating around the\nskeletal framework of the wet gel via reaction with the cross linker. These pellets can\nbe dried to mechanically robust X-Aerogel.\nThe extrusion process begins with the\npreparation of a suitable sol. This is accomplished online by mixing tow solutions as they \xef\xac\x82ow from two separate containers towards the mold. A typical sol\nthat yields a gel that can be cross-linked\neasily is made by mixing two cold solu-\n\n22\n\ntions: One solution consists of 4.5 volume parts of acetonitrile, 0.482 volume\nparts of aminopropyltriethoxysilane,\nand 1.45 volume parts of tetramethoxysilane. The other solution consists of 4.5 volume parts of acetonitrile\nand 1.5 volume parts of water.\nThe cold sol is equipped with a plunger.\nAs soon as the sol gels in the mold, the\nnewly formed gel is pushed out of the\nmold and is chopped to the desired\nlength. When the gel mold is exhausted,\nthe plunger is retracted and the process\nrepeated. An important consideration in\nthe process is that the sol needs to have\nformed a gel, which is stable enough to\nslice before the extrusion process is\nbegun. The process can be used with\nnearly any sol-gel formulations, but high\nthroughout requires a fast gelling sol such\nas the one obtained by using aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES)/tetramethoxysilane (TMOS) mixtures. In this formulation, control of the gelation rate requires\nthat the precursor solutions must be refrigerated prior to \xef\xac\x81lling the mold. In an\nextension of the basic process described\nhere, multiple molds with plungers can\nbe connected to a liquid manifold con-\n\nnected to a sol-preparation apparatus and\nmounted together to facilitate repeated\n\xef\xac\x81lling with sol and automatic extrusion.\nThe most bene\xef\xac\x81t from this process is\nrealized when it is combined with chemical cross linking as pellets emerge from\nthe mold. A suitable cross linker is a diisocynanate (e.g., Desmodour N3200 from\nBayer Corporations, or equivalent),\nwhich, owing to the small size of the pellets, diffuses and reacts quickly with the\ninternal surfaces of the porous nanoparticle framework of the wet gels. The wetpellets are subsequently dried from supercritical carbon dioxide, yielding\nmechanically robust colorless, slightly\ntranslucent pellets of X-Aerogel. Other\ncross-linker systems such as epoxies and\npolyole\xef\xac\x81ns have been also investigated.\nThis work was done by Nicholas Leventis,\nJames C. Johnston, and James D. Kinder of\nGlenn Research Center.

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nFigure 1 is a simpli\xef\xac\x81ed schematic diagram of a system that automatically regulates the concentration of glucose or\npH in a liquid culture medium that is\ncirculated through a rotating-wall perfused bioreactor. Another system, shown\nin Figure 2, monitors the concentration\nof oxygen in the culture medium.\nThe glucose-regulating system includes an electrochemical sensor that\nmeasures the concentration of glucose\nin the medium \xef\xac\x82owing out of the bioreactor, a reservoir containing a concentrated glucose stock solution, and a peristaltic pump. The sensor reading is\ndigitized and monitored by a computer,\nwhich generates commands to open and\nclose valves, as described below, to adjust\nthe concentration of glucose. This allows the system to maintain an optimal\nconcentration of glucose without using\nlarge volumes of cell culture medium.\nThe glucose control system operates in\none of the following three modes (see\nFigure 1): perfusion, where the medium\nis simply circulated without adding or removing any liquid; infusion, where fresh\n\ncell medium is introduced into circulation, replacing the spent medium in the\nbioreactor; injection, where a small\namount of concentrated glucose solution is added to the bioreactor when the\nglucose concentration falls below 75\nmg/dL.\nThe electrochemical glucose sensor\nincludes a membrane that is covered\nwith a thin (10 to 200 mm thick) layer of\nimmobilized glucose oxidase enzyme\nand is coupled to a three-electrode amperometric probe and a \xef\xac\x82ow cell. Glucose diffuses through the membrane\nand, in the presence of the glucose oxidase, is converted to hydrogen peroxide\nand gluconic acid. The rate of generation of hydrogen peroxide is measured\namperometrically on a platinum working electrode at a potential of 0.7 V with\nrespect to an Ag/AgCl reference electrode. The sensor reading is correlated\nwith the concentration of glucose by the\nMichaelis-Menten equation,\nI=ImaxS/(K + S),\nwhere I is the sensor current, Imax is the\nmaximum sensor current for the amper-\n\nBioreactor\n\nOxygenator\n\nOxygenator\n\nComputer\nSensor\nValve 1\n\nValve 2\n\nValve 3\n\nNO\n\nNO\n\nNO\n\nNC\n\nNC\n\nPeristaltic\nPump\n\nNC\nNO \xe2\x80\x93 Normally Opened\nNC \xe2\x80\x93 Normally Closed\n\nUsed\nNutrient\nOut\n\nGlucose\nSolution\nIn\n\nFresh\nNutrient Medium\nIn\n\nFigure 1.

This\nsensor system has been tested in cell culture experiments for over 50 days. The\ncontrol of glucose in this manner reduces the amount of culture medium required to optimally grow cells.\nThe pH sensor, described in \xe2\x80\x9cOptoelectronic Instrument Monitors pH in a\nCulture Medium\xe2\x80\x9d (MSC-23107), NASA\nTech Briefs, Vol. 28, No. 9 (September\n2004), page 4a, was coupled to the above\ncontrol system containing a small volume\nof a mixture of sodium and potassium hydroxide and bicarbonate solution to form\na pH control system. When the sensor pH\noutput fell below a preset level, a small\namount of buffer was injected to the\nbioreactor to bring the pH to the desired\nlevel. This system was tested in a 120-day\ncell run, where the pH was controlled at\n7.1\xc2\xb10.1 pH unit. The volume of buffer\nused was negligible compared to the volume\nof\ncell culture medium required for the\nsame level of pH control. By controlling\nthe culture pH in this manner, the cells\nproduced less bio\xef\xac\x81lm.\nThe oxygen-monitoring system is designed to satisfy special requirements for\nnoninvasiveness, sterilizability, compactness, light weight, and nontoxicity to the\ncells nourished by the solution.

The instrument\nwould measure intensity at wavelengths of 380, 412, 446, 558, 866,\n1,375, and 2,130 nm. Polarization plus\nintensity would be measured at 670\nand 1,630 nm.\nThe design of the instrument would\nbe dominated by the requirement for\npolarimetric accuracy. Of several polarimetric approaches that were considered, the one selected to satisfy this requirement involves adaptation of\nadvanced techniques of high-precision\nimaging polarimetry used in groundbased solar astronomy. The approach\n\ninvolves the use of (1) a photoelastic\nmodulator to rapidly rotate the plane of\npolarization, (2) one or two analyzers\nand corresponding linear arrays of photodetectors, and (3) demodulation of\nthe photodetector outputs to obtain\ndata from which one can compute the\nStokes parameters Q and U (pertaining\nto the predominance of horizontal over\nvertical linear polarization and the predominance of 45\xc2\xb0 over 135\xc2\xb0 polarization, respectively).

A planned future version of the system would also provide data on the\nthickness of snow covering sea ice. Frequent measurements of the thickness of\npolar ocean sea ice and its snow cover\non a synoptic scale are critical to understanding global climate change and\nocean circulation.\nThe CAS system includes two relatively-narrow-band chirped radar subsystems that operate about two different\nnominal middle frequencies in the veryhigh-frequency (VHF) range (e.g., 137\nand 162 MHz). The radar targets the\nsame surface area from two slightly different directions (see \xef\xac\x81gure). The radar\nbackscatter signals are processed to extract angular- and frequency-domain correlation functions (ACF/FCF) so that\nthe system acts, in effect, as a combined\nspatial- and frequency-domain interferometric radar system.\nThe phase of the ACF/FCF varies\nwith the thickness of the sea ice. To enable the utilization of the phase information to compute this thickness, the\ninteractions between the radar waves\nand the seawater, ice, and snow cover\nare represented by a mathematical\nmodel: The snow, sea ice (including\nair bubbles and brine inclusions), and\nseawater are represented as layers,\neach characterized by an assumed\nthickness and a known or assumed\ncomplex-number index of refraction.\nEach interface (air/snow, snow/ice,\nand ice/water) is modeled as deviating\nfrom a plane by a surface roughness\n\nRadar Subsystem 2: 162 MHz\n\nRadar Subsystem 1: 137 MHz\n\n\xce\xb81\n\xce\xb82\n\nSnow\n\nBubbles\nand\nBrine\nInclusions\n\nSea Ice\nWidth of\nResolution\nCell\nSeawater\nWidth of Illuminated Swath\n\nTwo Chirped VHF Radar Subsystems operating about different nominal middle frequencies targets\nthe same surface area from two slightly different angles.

The scattering from within the layers is computed\nby a Rayleigh volume scattering model.\nThe ACF/FCF is computed from the\nscattered signals.\nAssuming that the ACF/FCF obeys the\nmodel, the interferometric phase information can be inverted by use of a suitable computational inversion technique\n(e.g., a genetic algorithm or gradient descent or other least-squares technique)\nto obtain the thickness of the sea ice. In\nessence, the inversion amounts to seek-\n\ning whichever value of sea-ice thickness\nused in the model yields the best match\nbetween (1) the ACF/FCF interferometric phase computed from the model and\n(2) the ACF/FCF measured interferometric phase.\nThis work was done by Ziad Hussein,\nRolando Jordan, Kyle McDonald, Benjamin Holt, and John Huang of Caltech;\nYasuo Kugo, Akira Ishimaru, and Sermsak\nJaruwatanadilok of the University of Washington, Seattle; and Torry Akins and\nPrasad Gogineni of the University of\nKansas, Lawrence, for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet\nPropulsion Laboratory.

Glenn Research Center, Cleveland, Ohio\nThe device illustrated in Figure 1 is\ndesigned primarily for use as a regenerative heat exchanger in a miniature Stirling engine or Stirling-cycle heat pump.\nA regenerative heat exchanger (sometimes called, simply, a \xe2\x80\x9cregenerator\xe2\x80\x9d in\n\n26\n\nthe Stirling-engine art) is basically a\nthermal capacitor: Its role in the Stirling\ncycle is to alternately accept heat from,\nthen deliver heat to, an oscillating \xef\xac\x82ow\nof a working \xef\xac\x82uid between compression\nand expansion volumes, without intro-\n\nducing an excessive pressure drop.\nThese volumes are at different temperatures, and conduction of heat between\nthese volumes is undesirable because it\nreduces the energy-conversion ef\xef\xac\x81ciency\nof the Stirling cycle. Hence, among the\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 2006\n\nFlow\n\nNickel\nPhotoresist\n\nMAGNIFIED VIEW OF A\nFEW CELLS\n\nFlow\n\nMULTILAYER DEVICE\n\nFigure 1. The Con\xef\xac\x81guration of This Device Is Typical of a microscale heat exchanger as described in the\ntext. The materials and dimensions shown here are representative rather than exclusive: they were chosen in a design trade study in which account was taken of capabilities for fabrication and of requirements for low axial thermal conduction and low pressure drop under a speci\xef\xac\x81c set of assumptions.\n\ndesired characteristics of a regenerative\nheat exchanger are low pressure drop\nand low thermal conductivity along the\n\xef\xac\x82ow axis.\nAs shown in the enlarged views in Figure 1, the device features a multilayer\ngrating structure in which each layer is\noffset from the adjacent layer by half a\ncell opening along both axes perpendicular to the flow axis. In addition, each\ngrating layer is a composite of a highthermal conductivity (in this case,\nnickel) sublayer (see Figure 2) and a\nlow-thermal-conductivity (in this case,\nphotoresist) sublayer. As a hot fluid\nflows through from, say, top to bottom,\nheat from the fluid is transferred to,\nand stored in, the cell walls of this de-\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 2006\n\nvice.

The offset of adjacent layers creates reduced-size, partially isolated cross sections for thermal\nconduction, thereby further reducing\nthe overall axial thermal conductance of\nthe device.\nOnce the device has been installed\nin its intended operational setting\n(e.g., as a regenerative heat exchanger\nin a Stirling machine), some delamination of the layers is permissible, provided that the half-cell offset between\n\nFigure 2.

Indeed, delamination enhances performance by reducing axial thermal conduction.\nThe reasonably high porosity of the\ndevice helps to keep the pressure drop\nlow. The layer-to-layer offset disrupts the\nformation of boundary layers in the \xef\xac\x82ow,\nthereby contributing to the maintenance of low pressure drop.

Johnson Space Center, Houston, Texas\nPractical Simulator Network (PSimNet)\nis a set of data-communication protocols\ndesigned especially for use in handling\nmessages between computers that are engaging cooperatively in real-time or nearlyreal-time training simulations. In a typical\napplication, computers that provide individualized training at widely dispersed locations would communicate, by use of\nPSimNet, with a central host computer\nthat would provide a common computational-simulation environment and common data. Originally intended for use in\nsupporting interfaces between training\ncomputers and computers that simulate\nthe responses of spacecraft scienti\xef\xac\x81c payloads, PSimNet could be especially well\nsuited for a variety of other applications \xe2\x80\x94\nfor example, group automobile-driver\ntraining in a classroom. Another potential\napplication might lie in networking of automobile-diagnostic computers at repair\nfacilities to a central computer that would\ncompile the expertise of numerous technicians and engineers and act as an expert\nconsulting technician.\nHeretofore, a message transported in a\ndata-communication network has been of\none of two types: delivery-critical or time-\n\ncritical. Networks that transport deliverycritical messages need protocols that assure the sending computers that deliverycritical messages are in fact delivered to\nthe proper recipient computers. Networks\nthat transport time-critical messages need\nprotocols that deliver messages to the intended recipient computers as quickly as\npossible because the value of a time-critical message diminishes over time. (Typically, it is better to send an updated timecritical message than to time out and\nresend a stale time-critical message.) Prior\nto the conception of PSimNet, there was\nno available set of protocols that would enable a network to handle both time-critical\nand delivery-critical messages.\nPSimNet is built on the Transmission\nControl Protocol/ Internet Protocol\n(TCP/IP) suite of protocols, which includes the TCP and the user datagram\nprotocol (UDP). The TCP/IP and the\nUDP protocols offer offsetting advantages\nand disadvantages with respect to the reliability needed for transport of deliverycritical messages and the speed needed for\ntransport of time-critical messages:\nTCP/IP provides some assurances of\nproper delivery of a delivery-critical mes-\n\nFirst Computer\nTime\nCritical\nMessage\n\nMessage\nDelivery Type\n\nDelivery\nCharacteristic\nDelivery\nCritical\n\nMessage\nReceiver\n\nMessage-Type\nDeterminator\n\nMessage-Delivery\nSelector\n\nMessage\nTransporter\n\nSecond\nComputer\n\nTime-Critical\nMessage\nProtocol\n\nUDP\n\nDelivery-Critical\nMessage\nProtocol\n\nEnhanced\nUDP\n\nMessage Timers\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nSequence Numbers\nMultiple\nComputers\n\nA Message Is Sent From One Computer to Another in a data-communication network that utilizes the\nPSimNet set of protocols.

The overall\nfunction of the system is to convey a message from the \xef\xac\x81rst computer to a second\ncomputer. The message begins with a\nheader that, among other things, speci\xef\xac\x81es\na delivery characteristic (time-critical or delivery-critical). First, the message is received by a message receiver, then its delivery characteristic is analyzed by a\nmessage-type determinator. On the basis of\nthe analyzed delivery characteristic, a message-delivery selector then selects the protocol to be used in transporting the message. In the present version of PSimNet,\nthe preferred protocol for time-critical\nmessages is UDP, while that for deliverycritical messages is a modi\xef\xac\x81ed version of\nUDP that incorporates additions to make it\nmore reliable.\nA message transporter then transports\nthe message to the second computer by\nuse of the selected protocol. The message transporter can send the message\nto multiple computers if instructed to do\nso by the \xef\xac\x81rst computer.\nThis work was done by John P.

On a typical day, there are tens\nof thousands of flights in the United\nStates and several times that number\nthroughout the world. Depending on\nthe specific aircraft design, the volume\nof data collected by sensors and flight\nrecorders can range from a few dozen\nto several thousand parameters per second during a flight. Whereas these data\nhave long been utilized in investigating\ncrashes, the present method is oriented\ntoward helping to prevent crashes by\nenabling routine monitoring of flight\noperations to identify portions of flights\nthat may be of interest with respect to\nsafety issues.\nExperience has taught that statistically atypical flights often pose safety issues. Conventional methods of finding\nanomalous flights in bodies of digital\nflight data require users to pre-define\nthe operational patterns that constitute\nunwanted performances. Typically, for\nexample, a program examines flight\ndata for exceedences (e.g., instances of\nexcessive speed, excessive acceleration,\nand other parameters outside normal\nranges). In other words, a conventional\nflight-data-analysis computer program\nfinds only the patterns it is told to seek\n\nin flight data, and is blind to newly\nemergent patterns that it has not been\ntold to seek. The present method overcomes this deficiency in that it does not\nrequire any pre-specification of what to\nlook for in bodies of flight data. The\nmethod is based partly on the principle\nthat it is necessary, not only to look for\nexceedences, but to go beyond exceedences, looking for more subtle data\npatterns that often cannot be prescribed in advance.\nThe method involves a series of processing steps that convert the massive\nquantities of raw data, collected during\nroutine flight operations, into useful information. The raw data are progressively reduced using both deterministic\nand statistical methods. Multivariate\ncluster analysis is performed to group\nflights by similarity with respect to flight\nsignatures derived from parameter values. The process includes analysis of\nmultiple selected flight parameters for\na selected phase of a selected flight, and\nfor determining when the selected\nphase of the selected flight is atypical in\ncomparison with the corresponding\nphases of other, similar flights for which\ncorresponding data are available. For\neach flight, there is computed an atypicality score based partly on results from\nthe cluster analysis. The distribution of\natypicality scores of all flights is used to\nidentify flights for examination.\nThe data from each day\xe2\x80\x99s flights are\nprocessed during the night and sum-\n\nmarized in a document, called the\n\xe2\x80\x9cMorning Report,\xe2\x80\x9d that includes a list\nof the 20 percent of flights having the\nhighest atypicality scores, ranked in\norder of descending atypicality score.\nFor each flight, the report includes a\nplain-language description of what\nmakes the flight atypical. With the\nhelp of software designed to be\nintuitively useable, an analyst works\nthrough this list of flights to the finest\nlevel of detail where necessary, examining the characteristics that made\nthem atypical, assessing their operational significance, and determining\nthe need for further action.\nThis work was done by Irving Statler,\nThomas Chidester, and Michael Shafto of\nAmes Research Center; Thomas Ferryman, Brett Amidan, Paul Whitney, Amanda\nWhite, Alan Willse, Scott Cooley, Joseph Jay,\nLoren Rosenthal, Andrea Swickard, Derrick\nBates, Chad Scherrer, and Bobbie-Jo Webb of\nBattelle Memorial Institute; Robert Lawrence\nof Safe Flight; Chris Mosbrucker, Gary\nProthero, Adi Andrei, Tim Romanowski,\nDaniel Robin, and Jason Prothero of\nProWorks Corporation; Robert Lynch of\nFlight Safety Consultants; and Michael Lowe\nof the U.S. Navy.

Airlines,\nmilitary units, corporate operators, and\nothers analyze aircraft flight data\nto identify contributing factors and\n\ncorrective actions for situations in\nwhich aircraft performance parameters\nexceed normal limits during phases of\nflight. The programs for performing\nsuch exceedance-based analyses are denoted flight operations quality assurance (FOQA in civilian settings) programs and take their inspiration from\nstatistical process control. However,\nFOQA analysis involves use of only a\nportion of the data: large quantities of\ndata are scanned to extract and under-\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 2006\n\nstand a small number of predefined\nevents.

There is a need to automate scanning, analysis, and reporting to produce meaningful information\nupon which human analysts can act.\nThe APMS software is intended to satisfy\nthis need. Beginning with workload enhancements to exceedance-based\nFOQA analyses and progressing to sophisticated multivariate statistical analyses, the APMS has developed key software tools to advance the science of\n\xef\xac\x82ight-data analysis.\nAnother major component of the\nASMM Project is the Performance Data\nAnalysis and Reporting System\n(PDARS), which is developing networking and analysis hardware and software\nfor application air-traffic-control\n(ATC) radar data.

The analysis is\nperformed by software that extracts parameters of signals in the time and frequency domains. Scanning is effected by\nusing computer-controlled motorized\ntranslation stages to position the transducers at speci\xef\xac\x81ed pairs of locations and\nrepeating the measurement, data-acquisition, and data-analysis processes at the\nsuccessive locations.

One document presents results of a scan of a specimen containing a delamination.\nThis work was done by Don Roth of Glenn\nResearch Center.

These algorithms compute\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 2006\n\nfuel- or energy-optimal trajectories for\ntypical maneuvers by solving the associated optimal-control problems with relevant control and state constraints. In the\nderivations, these problems are converted from their original continuous\n(in\xef\xac\x81nite-dimensional) forms to \xef\xac\x81nite-dimensional forms through (1) discretization of the time axis and (2) spectral discretization of control inputs via a \xef\xac\x81nite\nnumber of Chebyshev basis functions. In\nthese doubly discretized problems, the\nChebyshev coef\xef\xac\x81cients are the variables.\nThese problems are, variously, either\nconvex programming problems or programming problems that can be convexi\xef\xac\x81ed. The resulting discrete problems\nare convex parameter-optimization\nproblems; this is desirable because one\ncan take advantage of very ef\xef\xac\x81cient and\nrobust algorithms that have been developed previously and are well established\nfor solving such problems. These algorithms are fast, do not require initial\nguesses, and always converge to global\noptima. Following the derivations, the\nalgorithms are demonstrated by applying them to numerical examples of \xef\xac\x82yby, descent-to-hover, and ascent-fromhover maneuvers.\nThis work was done by A. Bechet Acikmese\nand David Bayard of Caltech for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet\nPropulsion Laboratory.

These models\nare based on fitting coefficients of\nFourier functions of Sun-spacecraftEarth angles to observed spacecraft orbital motions. Construction of a model\nin this series involves the following steps:\n1. Form 10-day \xe2\x80\x9ctruth\xe2\x80\x9d orbit arcs from\nprecise daily GPS orbit data gathered\nduring more than four years.\n2. Construct a model of the solar-radia-\n\ntion pressure and estimate model-parameter values that make a leastsquares best \xef\xac\x81t of the model-predicted\ntrajectory to each of the \xe2\x80\x9ctruth\xe2\x80\x9d 10- day\norbit arcs.\n3. Using a least-squares procedure and\nutilizing the full covariance information from each 10-day \xef\xac\x81t, combine the\nestimates from all satellite arcs into a\nsingle set of model parameters for the\ntwo GPS constellations of the satellites\nnow or soon to be placed in service.\n4. Evaluate the model thus derived by\nmeans of orbit-data-\xef\xac\x81t and orbit-prediction tests.\nIn evaluations performed thus far,\nthese models have been found to offer\naccuracies significantly greater than\nthose of the prior models.\nThis work was done by Yoaz Bar-Sever and\nDa Kuang of Caltech for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet\nPropulsion Laboratory.

Two cameras would\nbe mounted at the base of the structure:\n(1) A star camera equipped with two\nseparate \xef\xac\x81elds of view: (a) imaging\nstars in the background near the\nstructure tip while excluding the tip\nfrom view to prevent saturation from\nsunlight re\xef\xac\x82ected from the tip, and\n(b) imaging the tip and have simultaneous stars in the background.\nFirst, in the absence of re\xef\xac\x82ected sunlight and with the self-illuminated\n\xef\xac\x81ducials on the structure turned off,\nthe star camera would open both\n\xef\xac\x81elds of view and establish the angular relationship between the two\n\xef\xac\x81elds of view.\n(2) The second camera (metrology camera) is too insensitive to observe stars\nbut sensitive enough to image a\nnumber of bright self-illuminated\n\xef\xac\x81ducials on the structure through a\nnarrow band pass \xef\xac\x81lter (even in the\npresence of sunlight) at high rates.\nStill in the absence of sunlight, the\nself-illuminated \xef\xac\x81ducials at the tip of\nthe structure are imaged simultane-\n\n33\n\nously by the star and metrology cameras to establish the relationship between the two different cameras.\nDuring operations, the star camera\nwould be operated in the tip-excluding\ncon\xef\xac\x81guration while the metrology camera tracked the tip. The orientation of\nthe base to tip line relative to the stars\nwould be determined by use of informa-\n\n34\n\ntion from the metrology camera, the star\ncamera, inertial measurement unit\n(IMU), and calibration data. The advantage of the proposed scheme is (1) it is\npossible to obtain attitude knowledge at\nhigh rates (based on IMU and metrology camera); (2) it is possible to operate\nwhen the antenna is illuminated by the\nSun; and (3) it is possible to perform on-\n\norbit alignment after launch.\nThis work was done by Carl Christian\nLiebe, Randall Bartman, Alexander\nAbramovici, Jacob Chapsky, Edward Litty,\nand Keith Coste of Caltech for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet\nPropulsion Laboratory.
