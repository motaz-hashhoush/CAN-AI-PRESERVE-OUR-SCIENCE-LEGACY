The robot\nin question, now undergoing conceptual\ndevelopment for use on the Moon, is the\nAll-Terrain Hex-Limbed Extra-Terrestrial\nExplorer (ATHLETE) rover, which is designed to roll over gentle terrain or walk\nover rough or steep terrain. Each leg of the\nrobot is a six-degree-of-freedom generalpurpose manipulator tipped by a wheel\nwith a motor drive. The tool interface includes a square cross-section peg, equivalent to a conventional socket-wrench drive,\nthat rotates with the wheel. The tool interface also includes a clamp that holds a tool\non the peg, and a pair of fold-out cameras\nthat provides close-up stereoscopic images\nof the tool and its vicinity. The field of view\nof the imagers is actuated by the clamp\nmechanism and is specific to each tool.\nThe motor drive can power any of a variety\nof tools, including rotating tools for helical\nfasteners, drills, and such clamping tools as\npliers. With the addition of a flexible coupling, it could also power another tool or\nremote manipulator at a short distance.\nThe socket drive can provide very high\ntorque and power because it is driven by\nthe wheel motor.\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 2007\n\nThis work was done by Jaret Matthews,\nNorman Ahmad, and Brian Wilcox of Caltech for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\nFurther information is contained in a TSP (see\npage 1).\nNPO-43308\n\nSecond-Generation\nElectronic Nose\nA report discusses the second generation of the JPL Electronic Nose (ENose),\nan array of 32 semi-specific chemical sensors used as an event monitor to identify\nand quantify contaminants released into\nbreathing air by leaks or spills. It is designed to monitor the environment for\nchanges in air quality, and is trained to\nidentify and quantify selected chemical\nspecies at predetermined concentrations,\nranging from sub-ppm to ppth. This system has improved reproducibility for making matched arrays, allowing use of data\nanalysis software with minimal recalibration on sensor set replacement. The Second Generation (SG) ENose is a follow-up\nto the first JPL Electronic Nose that was\ntested on an earlier space shuttle mission\n(STS-95). Improvements have been made\nto the hardware, sensor materials, and\ndata analysis software.\nThe SG ENose can be adapted to different applications and analyte sets by\n\nselection of sensor sets. A monolithic\nchassis eliminates most fittings, tubing,\nand dead space, improving the flow system. The SG ENose also includes humidity and temperature sensors in the\nsensing chamber for improved event\ndeconvolution. The design allows simple and rapid change-out of sensor sets\nand of filter material. All surfaces exposed to analyte are made of inert materials, and the unit is small enough to\nbe handheld.\nThis work was done by Margie Homer,\nShiao-Pin Yen, Margaret Ryan, Abhijit Shevade, Hanying Zhou, Adam Kisor, Darrell\nJan, April Jewell, Charles Taylor, Allison\nManfreda, and Kenneth Manatt of Caltech\nfor NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
