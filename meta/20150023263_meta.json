Childhood obesity is global public health concern including in South Korea where 16.2% of boys and 9.9% of girls are overweight or obese in 2011. Effective and sustainable intervention programs are needed for prevention of childhood obesity. Obesity prevention programs for young children may have a greater intervention effect than in older children. The NASA Mission X: Train Like an Astronaut (MX) program was developed to promote children's exercise and healthy eating by tapping into their excitement for training like an astronaut. This study aimed to examine the feasibility and effectiveness of the adapted NASA MX intervention in promoting PA in young children and in improving parents' related perspectives.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20150023263, "endDate": "2015-11-06T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "Obesity Society", "location": "Silver Spring, MD, United States"}}, "meetingId": "fe5f496a12d64838ba81a0e442ee9946", "id": "7a49d7e40f354b06b3b430dc208706ae"}], "name": "ObesityWeek 2015", "location": "Los Angeles, CA", "id": "fe5f496a12d64838ba81a0e442ee9946", "startDate": "2015-11-02T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20150023263, "id": "0f5cfdc8fcb2400f8979141fa436bc42", "publicationDate": "2015-11-02T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20150023263.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20150023263/downloads/20150023263.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20150023263/downloads/20150023263.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20150023263/downloads/20150023263.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
