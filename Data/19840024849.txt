These modules were\nprocured through Jet Propulsion Laboratory Flat-Plate Solar Array Project\nblock purchases, as well as by Sandia National Laboratories and the\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology-Lincoln Laboratory. These modules were\nused in a variety of tests, both as individual components and in continuing\nfull-scale system experiments. Of the modules originally procured for\ncomponent tests, a number completed all originally planned testing still in ..\nfunctioning condition. Of these, a small percentage (about 41 kilowatts) were\nconsidered to be unsuited for other planned test programs and were declared\nsurplus to the needs of DOE.\nAt the same time, numerous organizations and individuals wished to have\nsurplus modules. DOE had occasionally transferred ownership of surplus\ncollectors in past years for emergency communications facilities, industrial\nand university research programs and various public-assistance programs.\nRequests of this type continued to be received by DOE.\nInasmuch as no formal mechanism existed to coordinate these requests\nwith known supplies of surplus collectors, the Module Utilization Committee\nwas formed in July of 1982 to construct an inventory of surplus PV modules on\na nationwide basis and to act as a broker for requests for these modules\noriginating outside of the National Photovoltaics Program.\n\nSECTION II\nMEMBERSHIP\n\nThe Committee consisted of two subcommittees. The core subcommittee\nincluded members who met regularly to perform routine Committee functions.\nThe core committee representatives and the areas they presented are:\nJPL Program Analysis and Integration Center:\nG.A.\nJ.W.\nR.F.\nR.H.\nD.H.\n\nPraver (Chairman)\nFarrar\nGreenwodd\nLee\nOtth\n\nIn addition to the core committee, an advisory subcommittee provided\ninformation and opinions as required, mainly by telephone. The advisory\nsubcommittee representatives and the organizations they represent are:\nSandia National Laboratories, Albuquerque (SNLA):\nH. Baxter, H. Gerwin\nLewis Research Center (LeRC):\nA. Ratajczak\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology, Electronic Laboratory\n\n(MIT/EL):\n\nE. Kern\nDepartment of Energy Headquarters:\nA. Krantz\nOak Ridge National Laboratories (ORNL):\nS. Kaplan\nAerospace Corp.:\nS. Leonard\nThese members became the focal point at their institutions for all\nmatters relating to the work of the Committee, including collection of\nproposals from requesters and supplying information regarding availability,\ncharacteristics and locations of surplus modules.\n\nPreceding Page Blank\n\nSECTION III\nACTIVITIES\n\nThe Committee held 19 meetings between July 1982 and February 1984 at\napproximately one-month intervals. After each meeting, minutes were widely\ndistributed within the National Photovoltaics Program so that all interested\nparties would remain aware of Committee activities.\nThe first and most difficult task to be addressed was the development of\nan inventory of surplus modules. It was determined that all modules surplus\nto the needs of DOE were at JPL, SNLA, LeRC or MIT/EL. Using a variety of\nsources, a preliminary inventory of surplus modules at each of these locations\nwas constructed and in October 1982 each of these institutions received the\ndraft inventory of modules at its location. By January 1983 each institution\nhad returned its draft inventory with corrections, and the first complete\nworking inventory was assembled and circulated throughout the program. This\ninventory was then used as a basis for module distribution with continuous\nupdating reflecting actual distributions made and any discrepancies that were\nuncovered.\nAt the same time, property people were contacted at each of the\ninstitutions to establish the correct procedure for transferring modules from\nDOE to outside organizations. For each institution a procedure was agreed\nupon and copies of the transfer procedures were distributed throughout the\nprogram in December 1982.\nBy the beginning of 1983 the Committee was in a position to begin\ndistribution of modules. In March 1983 the first five requests were\nconsidered and the first actual shipment of surplus modules was made on April\n25, 1983, from SNLA. By June 1983 only 12 requests had been received by the\nCommittee and it became apparent that a public announcement would be required.\nIn the fall of 1983, announcements were placed in three periodicals whose\nreadership was mostly college science teachers. Appendix A presents a copy of\nthe news release and a list of publications in which it was carried. This\npublicity produced enough requests to deplete the inventory of surplus modules\ntotally. The last meeting of the Committee was held on February 13, 1984,\nwhen the last of the remaining modules were committed.\n\nPreceding Page Blank\n\nSECTION IV\nRESULTS\n\nSome of the important statistics of the Committee\'s activities are shown\nin Table 1 (wattage figures represent nominal watts of generating capacity).\n\nTable 1.\n\nNumber\nNumber\nNumber\nNumber\nNumber\n\nof\nof\nof\nof\nof\n\nModule Utilization Committee Statistics\n\nRequests Received\nRequests Approved\nRequests Not Approved\nModules Distributed\nModules per Recipient:\n\nNumber of Watts Distributed\nNumber of Watts per Recipient:\n\n68\n46\n22\n2,653\nAverage\nMinimum\nMaximum\n\n58\n1\n325\n40,473\n\nAverage\nMinimum\nMaximum\n\n880\n5\n6,638\n\nThe 46 recipients of surplus modules are situated in 19 states, as shown\nin Figure 1.

Telephone (818)354-5011\nFOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE\nSmall quantities of solar photovoltaic modules are available at no\ncharge to interested colleges and universities from the Department of Energy.\nDuring the past several years DOE has acquired a number of flat-plate\nphotovoltaic modules that have been used in tests and experiments. Although\nnearly all the modules are still installed in operating experimental systems,\na limited number are considered surplus to DOE\'s needs and are available for\neducational use.\nInterested colleges and universities may obtain the modules by paying\nonly the cost of shipping. They should submit brief proposals describing the\nway they would use the modules, as well as the quantity desired. Proposals\nwill be evaluated on a competitive basis by DOE\'s Module Utilization\nCommittee. The committee will consider educational merit, publicity value and\nindication of the proposing organization\'s commitment to follow through on its\nplans.\nDeadline for proposals is December 31. They should be submitted to\nGerald Praver, Chairman, Module Utilization Committee, Jet Propulsion\nLaboratory, Mail Stop 506-328, 4800 Oak Grove Drive, Pasadena, CA, 91109.\nMailing List for Release\nChronicle of Higher Education\n1333 New Hampshire Avenue, N.W.\nWashington, D.C. 20036\nJournal of College Science Teaching\n1742 Connecticut Avenue, N.W.\nWashington, D.C. 20009\nJournal of Higher Education\nOhio State University Press\n2070 Neil Avenue\nColumbus, OH 43210\n\nA-2\n\nAPPENDIX B\nDESCRIPTIONS OF RECIPIENTS OF SURPLUS MODULES\n\nB-l\n\nApplication\n\nNumber\nof\nModules\n\nTotal\nWatts\n\n225\n\n6638\n\n12\n\n222\n\nRequester\n\nLocation\n\nIowa State\nUniversity\n\nAmes, Iowa\n\nConstruction of a\ndemonstration gridconnected PV systems\nat the Land 0\' Lakes\nDairy Co-operative\nAnswer Farm near\nWebster City, Iowa.\nSystem will supplement existing wind\nturbine.\n\nStanford\nUniversity\n\nStanford,\nCalifornia\n\nStudent experiments\nin undergraduate\nenergy laboratory.\n\nLyon County,\nNevada (through\nNevada DOE)\n\nYerrington,\nNevada\n\nConstruction of PV\nsystem to power six\nTV repeaters located\nat Singatze Peak in\nLyon County.
