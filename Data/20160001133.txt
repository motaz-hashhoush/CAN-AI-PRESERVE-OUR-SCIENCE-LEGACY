Stones which are quite small may in some cases be\n\nYet another object of the present invention is to\n\npassed without hospitalization. However, in the remainder, the kidney stones become impacted in the ureter, a\nmuscle tube joining the kidney to the bladder. An impacted kidney stone is a source of intense pain and\nbleeding, a source of infection, and, if the stone completely blocks the flow of urine for any extended length\nof time, can cause the loss of a kidney. Small stones\nwhich are lodged in the lower third of the ureter can be\nremoved non-surgically by using a technique employing the well known Dormia stone basket. However,\nbasket removal of a kidney stone usually fails if the\nstone is lodged in the upper ureter, is impacted, or is\nlarger than one centimeter in diameter. In these cases,\nthe only procedure by which the stone could heretofore\nbe removed was through a serious surgical operation\ncalled a ureterolithotomy.\nMore recently, however, a non-surgical method for\nremoving kidney stones has been developed. In this\ntechnique, the kidney stones are subject to a vibratory\naction, such as that provided by an ultrasonically vibrated wire probe. In one such apparatus, a catheter is\nplaced cystoscopically at the site of the stone in the\nurinary tract, after which a long wire probe is passed\nthrough a lumen of the catheter and is brought into\ncontact with the stone. The wire probe is attached to\nthe ultrasonic transducer which, when energized, sets\nthe wire probe into lateral and longitudinal vibrations.\nThe vibrational energy is transmitted by the wire probe\nto the stone, causing it to fracture into small fragments\nwhich the patient can then pass spontaneously after\nwithdrawal of the catheter.\nWhile such apparatus can perform its intended function, a severe limitation has been found to exist due to\nslippage of the thin wire probe ofT the kidney stone and\nits lodgement between the stone and urinary tract. Attempts to ameliorate this situation by providing a wider\ntip cutting surface has resulted in premature breakage of\nthe wire probe at the tip exiting the catheter near the\nkidney stone. This occurs because the vibrational energy, typically 20 KHz in frequency, in conjunction\nwith the added cantilevered mass of the larger cutting\narea, causes the wire probe to snap ofT due to metal\nfatigue after 10-20 seconds of operation. This has been\nfound to be insufficient time to complete the disintegration procedure, as well as dangerous because it leaves\nmetal fragments in the urinary tract. A clear need,\ntherefore, exists to prolong the operational life of the\n\ngreatly enhance the fragmentation of kidney stones\nwhen using ultrasonic lithotripsy.\nThese and other objects of the present invention are\n25 provided by a cutting head which is attachable to the\nend of the ultrasonically vibrated wire probe. The cutting head includes a large diameter cutting section provided with a plurality of teeth formed on the periphency of one end thereof to present a cup-shaped re30 ceptacle to seat a kidney stone thereon. The member\nalso includes a collar integrally formed with the cutting\ntip section to reduce stress points along the probe.\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\n35\n\nThe foregoing, as well as other objects, features, and\nadvantages of the invention will become apparent from\nthe following detailed description when taken in conjunction with the appended drawings in which like\n4Q numbers represent the same or similar components\nthroughout the several drawings, and wherein:\nFIG. 1 is a side elevational view of state-of-the-art\napparatus for fragmenting kidney stones;\nFIG. 2 is a side elevational view of the cutting head of\n45 this invention; and\nFIG. 3 is a longitudinal view, partly in section, of the\ncutting head in contact with a kidney stone.\n\n50\n\nDESCRIPTION OF T HE PREFERRED\nEMBODIMENT\n\nReferring to the drawings, and, more particularly, to\nFIG. 1, there is illustrated an ultrasonic kidney stone\ndisintegration instrument in accordance with the prior\nart. The purpose of this Figure is to provide a better\n55 understanding of the invention to be described in detail\nin conjunction with FIGS. 2 and 3.\nFIG. 1 shows a cystoscope 10 inserted through a\npatient\'s urethra 12 into a bladder 14. A catheter 16 is\ninserted through the cystoscope 10, the bladder 14, and\n60 into a ureter 18 until its far end 20 comes into proximity\nto a piece of urinary calculi, hereinafter referred to as a\nkidney stone, 22. A wire probe 24 is inserted through\nthe catheter 16 until its far end 26 contacts the stone 22.\nThe diameter of the wire probe 24 is substantially\n65 smaller than the lumen diameter of the catheter 16 so\nthat any movement of the wire probe is not restricted by\nthe catheter material. The opposite, or near end, 28 of\nthe wire probe 24 is connected to the tip 30 of a mov-\n\n3\n\n4,823,793\n\nable ultrasonic transducer assembly 32 which is\nmounted on a base 34. The base 34 includes a handle 36\nhaving a trigger 37 which is connected to the transducer 32 for adjusting the position of the wire probe 24\nagainst the stone 22 by a linear translation of the transducer assembly 32 on the base 34. Base 34 additionally\nincludes an outward angular support member 38 which\nincludes a connector element in the form of a catheter\njoint 40 for engaging and holding the near end of the\ncatheter 16. The terminal portion of the wire probe is\nclamped to tip 30 of the transducer 32 by a set screw 42.\nWith the catheter 16 and wire probe 24 inserted into\nthe ureter 18, end 26 of the probe is optically guided to\nmake contact against kidney stone 22. Thereafter, the\ntransducer assembly 32 is energized to provide lateral\nmotion to the wire probe 24 and the probe is gently\npushed against the stone.\nThis apparatus does not operate as desired when tip\n26 of the wire probe slips off the surface of the stone 22\nand slides past it as illustrated in the dotted line position\nof tip 26\'. In this circumstance tip 26\' does not perform\nits intended function. Increasing the surface area of the\ncutting tip causes it to break off from the probe 24 at\nend 20 of catheter 16, at the point of greater stress\nwhere it emerges from the catheter.\nWith the foregoing in mind, a cutting tip 44 shown in\nFIGS. 2 and 3 is attached to end 26 of the wire probe to\novercome the problem of wire slippage and to greatly\nincrease the cutting surface area. Tip member 44 provides two structural features, one of which prevents\npremature breakage of the wire probe at the point of its\nexiting the catheter 16, while the other assures seating\nof the kidney stone within the tip member 44.\nMember 44 is of stainless steel construction and comprises two integrally formed coaxial cylindrical sections, an elongate collar section 46 which relieves stress,\nand a cutting tip section 48.\nMember 44 is also provided with a central circular\nopening (not shown) which extends completely\nthrough collar section 46 and through most of cutting\ntip section 48. The opening has a diameter sufficiently\nwide so that it is just capable of being slid over wire tip\n26. By inserting wire tip 26 through the opening as far\nas possible into the cutting tip section 48, the end of the\ncutting tip section is arranged to initially abut the kidney stone encountered. Member 44 is thereafter compressed and swaged to the wire probe 24, such as at\npoints 58 and 60 of the cutting tip section 48, thereby\nensuring its permanent retention thereon. Additionally,\ntip 26 can be undercut so as to present a recessed surface, further enhancing the swaging procedure.\nCollar section 46, has an external diameter larger than\nthat of probe 24, but less than the inner diameter of\ncatheter 16 and is of sufficient length to insure that it\nonly partially extends out of the catheter when it is in\nthe operational mode, best illustrated in FIG. 3.\nCutting tip section 48 has a slightly larger external\ndiameter than the external diameter of collar section 46\nbut less than the inner diameter of ureter 18. It is provided with a plurality of cutting teeth, preferably between three and six. The cutting tip section 48 is illustrated in FIG. 2 as having four teeth 50, 52, 54, and 56.\nTeeth 50, 52, 54, and 56 are formed on the periphery of\none end of the cutting tip section to provide a cupshaped receptacle for seating a kidney stone 22. Teeth\n50, 52, 54, and 56 are machined directly into the end of\ncutting tip section 48 and are desirably provided with\nflat ends so as to preclude the possibility of a pointed\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n4S\n\n50\n\n5S\n\n60\n\n65\n\n4\n\ntooth surface from scraping the urethra. While no specific configuration for the teeth is necessary, it has been\nfound that a suitable arrangement is one where the teeth\nare equidistantly-spaced, three-sided with one comer\nforming the cup-shaped receptacle, and with a tapering\ncross section.\nWhile not intended to be limiting, the following approximate dimensions of the cutting head 44 are presented by way of example only:\nDiameter of cutting tip section 48-0.063 inches\nLength of cutting tip section 48-0.16 inches\nDiameter of collar section 46-0.045 inches\nLength of collar section 46-0.233 inches\nIn such a configuration, the member 44 attached to the\nwire probe 24 transmits maximum acoustic vibrational\nenergy from the probe to the stone 22. The relatively\nlarge diameter of cutting tip section 48 increases the\ncutting surface area by a factor of three or more and\ninsures maximum contact between wire and stone 22 as\nwell as prevents slippage of the wire past the stone. The\ncup-shaped end of the tip 48 induces seating of the stone\n22 on the cutting tip.\nThe four teeth 50, 52, 54, and 56 assure maximum\nfragmentation of the stone 22. Even if the stone 22 is\nhighly irregular in shape and centering of the tip 48\nupon the stone is far from perfect, the stone will fragment when contacted by any portion of the cutting tip.\nThe lifetime of the wire probe 24 is substantially\nincreased by the provision of an elongate collar 46\nwhich partially stays within the catheter 16 while the\ncutting tip section 48 is extended against the stone 22.\nThe collar 46 greatly lessens the mechanical bending\nloads and stress points imposed on the wire probe 24 by\nthe vibrating mass of the cutting tip 48, because the root\nof the mass is within the catheter 16 and not cantilevered away from it. Further, by joining the cutting tip 48\nto the wire probe 24 by a swaged joint 58, 60 rather than\nby soldering, mechanical stresses and fatigue fractures\nare greatly lessened. The life of the assembly has been\nfound to exceed four minutes when vibrating at 20\nKHz, thus providing ample time to complete the kidney\nstone disintegration procedure.\nHaving thus shown and described the invention in\nspecific detail, the same has been provided by way of\nexplanation and not limitation and accordingly all modifications, alterations and changes coming within the\nspirit and scope of the invention are herein meant to be\nincluded.\nWe claim:\n1.
