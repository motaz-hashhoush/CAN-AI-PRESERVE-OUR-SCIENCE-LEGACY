NASA's multi-year strategic plan, called Vision 21, is also discussed. It proposes to use the unique perspective of space to better understand Earth. Among the NASA programs mentioned are the Magellan to Venus and Galileo to Jupiter spacecraft, the Cosmic Background Explorer, Pegsat (the first Pegasus payload), Hubble, the Joint U.S./German ROSAT X-ray Mission, Ulysses to Jupiter and over the sun, the Astro-Spacelab Mission, and the Gamma Ray Observatory. Copies of viewgraphs that illustrate some of these missions, and others, are provided. Also discussed were life science research plans, economic factors as they relate to space missions, and the outlook for international cooperation.", "title": "NASA reports", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PROCEEDINGS", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T18:00:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19930013974, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Obrien, John E."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Headquarters", "location": "Washington, DC United States"}}, "id": "744890d4f57e455baa63432dcbe1e7b2"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19930013974, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Fisk, Lennard A."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Headquarters", "location": "Washington, DC United States"}}, "id": "0954990096334aff8f9a73a7c9ba680f"}, {"sequence": 2, "submissionId": 19930013974, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Aldrich, Arnold A."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Headquarters", "location": "Washington, DC United States"}}, "id": "b3adebe666734e3ab6394d24ea20e831"}, {"sequence": 3, "submissionId": 19930013974, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Utsman, Thomas E."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Headquarters", "location": "Washington, DC United States"}}, "id": "ba9e975e5df040dc8d5fb90f7163febd"}, {"sequence": 4, "submissionId": 19930013974, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Griffin, Michael D."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Headquarters", "location": "Washington, DC United States"}}, "id": "68d3ee9d57f548bd997666a821435826"}, {"sequence": 5, "submissionId": 19930013974, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Cohen, Aaron"}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Headquarters", "location": "Washington, DC United States"}}, "id": "debbe62dba6f40218bb0660dda646a9d"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Proceedings", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-27T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19930013974, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19930013974, "id": "fbba8f6e996249678199dd77bb9969e5", "publicationName": "The Eighth National Space Symposium", "publicationDate": "1992-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
