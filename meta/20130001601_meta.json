Given the surface definition for each component that makes up a complex configuration, the determination of hole points with appropriate hole boundaries is automatically and efficiently performed. Improvements made to the original X-rays approach for identifying the minimum hole include an automated closure scheme for hole-cutters with open boundaries, automatic determination of grid points to be considered for blanking by each hole-cutter, and an adaptive X-ray map to economically handle components in close proximity. Furthermore, an automated spatially varying offset of the hole boundary from the minimum hole is achieved using a dual wall-distance function and an orphan point removal iteration process. Results using the new scheme are presented for a number of static and relative motion test cases on a variety of aerospace applications.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20130001601, "endDate": "2012-07-13T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "Seventh International Conference on Computational Fluid Dynamics (ICCFD7)", "location": "Big Island, HI", "id": "af893049d3c84d19aeb90e970842994a", "startDate": "2012-07-09T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20130001601, "id": "49b44e2e48eb42f9973542f02362241a", "publicationDate": "2012-07-09T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 20140002220, "type": "SEE_ALSO", "title": "Advances in Domain Connectivity for Overset Grids Using the X-Rays Approach", "stiType": "PRESENTATION", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20130001601.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20130001601/downloads/20130001601.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20130001601/downloads/20130001601.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20130001601/downloads/20130001601.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
