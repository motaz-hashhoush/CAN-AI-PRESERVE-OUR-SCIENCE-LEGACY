The material came out of 3 decades of tribological research, work studying high-temperature friction, lubrication, and the wearing of interacting surfaces that are in relative motion. It was developed as a shaft coating deposited by thermal spraying to protect foil air bearings used in oil-free turbomachinery, like gas turbines, and is meant to be part of a larger project: an oil-free aircraft engine capable of operating at high temperatures with increased reliability, lowered weight, reduced maintenance requirements, and increased power. This advanced coating, PS300, is a self-lubricating bearing material containing chromium oxide, with additions of a low-temperature start up lubricant (silver) and a high-temperature lubricant, making it remarkably stable at high temperatures, and better suited than previously available materials for high-stress conditions. It improves efficiency, lowers friction, reduces emissions, and has been used by NASA in advanced aeropropulsion engines, refrigeration compressors, turbochargers, and hybrid electrical turbogenerators. PS300 is ideal in any application where lowered weight and reduced maintenance are desired, and high-temperature uses and heavy operating speeds are expected. It has notable uses for the Space Agency, but it has even further-reaching potential for the industrial realm.", "title": "Cost-Cutting Powdered Lubricant", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-07T10:56:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-27T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20060022042, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20060022042, "id": "883bb76bcda0484796de508574a2fe67", "publicationName": "Spinoff 2005", "publicationDate": "2005-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20060022042.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20060022042/downloads/20060022042.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20060022042/downloads/20060022042.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20060022042/downloads/20060022042.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
