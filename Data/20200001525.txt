b'AGU 100 Fall Meeting (2019)\nKevin Zahnle, NASA Ames Research Center, Moffett Field, CA, United States\n\nTitle: Earth\xe2\x80\x99s early reduced atmospheres\n200 character summary:\nEarth\xe2\x80\x99s early atmosphere evolved in response to cosmic impacts, photochemistry, hydrogen\nescape, mineral redox buffering, iron in the mantle, and crustal weathering and subduction.\nAbstract:\nEarth\xe2\x80\x99s early atmosphere evolved in response to cosmic impacts, photochemistry generated by\nthe copious extreme ultraviolet radiation emitted by the young Sun, hydrogen escape, mineral\nredox buffering, the evolution of iron in the mantle, and the character of crustal weathering\nand subduction. No single chemical composition, surface pressure, or temperature was typical.\nAfter the biggest impacts the temperature likely rose above 3000 K and the atmosphere held\nrock vapor. As the atmosphere cooled its constituents rained out: first the silicates, then the\ngeochemical volatiles (such as salt), and last the water. Depending on the size of the impact,\ncooling took thousands to millions of years. Between impacts the atmosphere was thick with\ngases like CO2, H2, and CH4 that do not condense at Earth but provide greenhouse warming\nthat could easily have maintained surface temperatures in excess of 500 K.\nAt some point the early atmosphere must have been conducive to the evolution of organic\nchemistry and the origin of life. It was therefore --- at times --- dominated by reduced gases like\nhydrogen and methane. Hydrogen-methane atmospheres are easily formed thermochemically\nafter major impacts if H2O and CO2 were present on Earth in quantities consistent with their\ninventories on Earth today \xe2\x80\x93 the key is high pressure. Hydrogen-methane atmospheres slowly\nbreak down over millions of years by hydrogen escape and photochemistry. At first methane\ndecomposes into tars and nitriles that precipitate, but later as the atmosphere grows more\noxidized from hydrogen escape the methane oxidizes to CO and CO2, with a small fraction\ngoing to HCN. Impacts can also produce NH3 directly from N2 and H2O, which is expected to\nrain out with the H2O.\nAs impacts grew infrequent the climate cooled in response to the fixing of CO2 as carbonate\nand carbonate subduction. Eventually the CO2 was mostly removed to the mantle and the\nsurface mostly frozen.\n\n'
