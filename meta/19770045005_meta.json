Recommendations to adopt a program with the ultimate objective of launching an earth satellite were submitted in October 1945 by a committee established within the Navy Bureau of Aeronautics. In 1946 it was recommended by the Aeronautical Board that the services proceed independently with their satellite studies. A report concerning the 'preliminary design of an experimental world-circling spaceship' was published by RAND on May 2, 1946. RAND in early 1949 was again asked to study for the Air Force the possible uses of earth satellites. The reasons which prevented at that time a further development and implementation of initial concepts and study results are examined", "title": "U.S. satellite proposals, 1945-49", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-08T21:45:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19770045005, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Saegesser, L.
