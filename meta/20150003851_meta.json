Overall, the observing time loss was about 12.3%, which is in-line with previous years. A table of relative incidence of problems with various subsystems is presented. The most significant identified causes of loss were electronics rack problems (accounting for about 21.8% of losses), antenna reliability (18.1%), RFI (11.8%), and receiver problems (11.7%). About 14.2% of the losses occurred for unknown reasons. New antennas are under development in the USA, Germany, and Spain. There are plans for new telescopes in Norway and Sweden. Other activities of the Network Coordinator are summarized.", "title": "Network Coordinator Report", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2015-03-30T16:35:06.9730000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20150003851, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Himwich, Ed"}, "organization": {"name": "NVI, Inc.", "location": "Greenbelt, MD, United States"}}, "id": "408b83c5a274438c84f088abd8bda0de"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 20150003851, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Strand, Richard "}, "organization": {}}, "id": "f568a2e985294781a371c77f982af86d"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "id": 20150003851, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20150003851, "id": "09ebe498037547e79d3c0a860d9c4b71", "publicationName": "International VLBI Service for Geodesy and Astrometry 2012 Annual Report", "publicationDate": "2013-06-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 20140010415, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "International VLBI Service for Geodesy and Astrometry 2012 Annual Report", "stiType": "TECHNICAL_PUBLICATION", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20150003851.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20150003851/downloads/20150003851.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20150003851/downloads/20150003851.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20150003851/downloads/20150003851.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
