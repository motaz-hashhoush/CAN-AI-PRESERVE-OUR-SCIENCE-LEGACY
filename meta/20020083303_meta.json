The project involved connecting and transferring blood and fluids between sterile plastic containers while maintaining a closed system. SEBRA markets the PIRF Process to manufacturers of medical catheters. It is a precisely controlled method of heating thermoplastic materials in a mold to form or weld catheters and other products. The process offers advantages in fast, precise welding or shape forming of catheters as well as applications in a variety of other industries.", "title": "Precision Heating Process", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-20T23:12:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-09-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20020083303, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20020083303, "isbn": "0-16-038211-4", "id": "85519b8dfdb14c33894c982de426f612", "publicationName": "Spinoff 1992", "publicationDate": "1992-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20020083303.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20020083303/downloads/20020083303.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20020083303/downloads/20020083303.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20020083303/downloads/20020083303.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
