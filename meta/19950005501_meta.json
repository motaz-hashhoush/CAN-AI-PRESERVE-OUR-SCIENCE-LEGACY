Potential applications of these analysis results are also presented. The first section describes how software complexity analysis provides quantitative information on code, such as code structure and risk areas, throughout the software life cycle. Software complexity analysis allows an analyst to understand the software structure, identify critical software components, assess risk areas within a software system, identify testing deficiencies, and recommend program improvements. Performing this type of analysis during the early design phases of software development can positively affect the process, and may prevent later, much larger, difficulties. The second section describes how software reliability estimation and prediction analysis, or software reliability, provides a quantitative means to measure the probability of failure-free operation of a computer program, and describes the two tools used by JSC to determine failure rates and design tradeoffs between reliability, costs, performance, and schedule.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19950005501, "id": "45a6043352a14b5a98783408b7698998", "publicationDate": "1994-08-01T04:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19950005501.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19950005501/downloads/19950005501.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19950005501/downloads/19950005501.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19950005501/downloads/19950005501.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
