Borden, H. A. Weeden, D. N. Applegate, and N. B. Boiling\n\nThis project was designed as a test of the hybrid approach to data\nprocessing, developed by ORSER (described in ORSER-SSEL Technical\nReport 13-73). An area just south and west of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania,\nwas chosen because the same area had been used in the development\nof\nthe hybrid approach and it was thought desirable to be able\nto compare\nthe results of the two studies.\n\nThree constructive frames of U2\n\nphotography (nos. 13, 14, and 15) from sensor 14 of flight\n72-124,\nflown in July 1972, were used. These were mounted between\nglass plates\nand projected onto the digital output, using an American\nOptical Company\nDelineascope, Model D.\n\nOne of these photographs is shown in Figure 1.\nDigital data from ERTS-1 scene 1080-15185, collected\nOctober 11, 1972,\nwere used in the analysis.\n\nA portion of the channel 7 image of this\n\nscene is shown in Figure 2.\n\nProcedure\n\nAfter the study area was subset from the NASA tapes\nonto working\ntapes, NMAP and UMAP were run for review of definable\nboundaries and\nselection of the first set of training areas. The most\neasily recognized targets from spectrally homogeneous areas with positive\nwidely\nseparated geographic locations were chosen. (The Susquehanna\nRiver\nis an excellent example of such a target.) These targets\nwere positively identified by projecting the U2 photograph onto\nthe NMAP output.\nScale distortions of this map, however, prevented proper\nregistration\nof the photo over the entire area of the map. This\nrequired a distribution of positively identified targets throughout the\narea in order\nthat adjacent portions of the scene could be sequentially\nbrought into\nproper registration. Areas 10 to 25 cm square (representing\napproximately 0.2 to 0.4 square miles) could be brought into\nregistration by\nthis method.\n\niFor complete program descriptions,\nsee ORSER-SSEL -Technical\nReport 10-73.\n\n2\n\nPRINT NOT YET AVAILABLE\n\nFigure\n\n1:\n\nBlack and white enlargement of a portion of the U2 photograph of the Harrisburg area.

These maps were produced in separate categories\n(such as all vegetation) for ease of checking. Figure 3 1 shows\nsuch\na map.\n\nNote first the easily recognized Susquehanna River on the upper\nright, with the meandering Conodoguinet Creek entering from the\nleft.\nIn addition to the river and the creek, the map shows the categories\nof OPEN LAND, FOREST, and GOLF COURSE. Some areas verified by\ncorrelation with the U2 photograph are outlined on this\nmap. Lesser areas,\nnow geographically fixed and interpreted from the photograph,\nwere then\ndefined. The number and variety of targets was thus expanded\nwith\nrespect to both the type and the extent of geographic separation.\nThis\ncyclic operation was repeated until it was considered necessary\nto use\ncluster analysis where uniform areas of sufficient size could\nnot be\nfound to define training areas for the STATS program. The\nDCLUS program,\nwhich uses the techniques of cluster analysis to find signatures\nfor\nareas of small size or spectral nonhomogeneity, was then applied.\nThe\nmajority of training areas processed with this program were\nselected\nby the photointerpreters on the U2 photograph and then correlated\nwith\nthe computer map. (The industrial and suburban categories\nshown in\nFigure 4 were developed in this way.) The map was verified\nby correlation with the U2 photography and the targets successfully\ndefined\nwere outlined. This comparison revealed that one of the\nareas mapped\nas suburban also included a considerable number of agricultural\nfields\n(the category of SUBURB CONFUSION in Figure 4 ). When one\nconsiders\nthe mixed character of a suburban area, consisting of\nroofs, lawns,\nshrubs, and streets, it is easy to see how some of those\ncombinations\nmight resemble a mixture of small fields or long and narrow\nfields\nresulting from contour plowing. The signature for this\ncategory (number\n2) and that for FIELD (number 3), shown in Table 1 ,\nreveal that these\ntwo signatures do not have a wide separation. Thus,\nconfusion between\nthese two categories could be anticipated. In contrast,\nthe separability\nof category 1 (RIVER) from every other category is quite\nlarge, implying\nFigures 3, 4, and 5 were transcribed from the character\nmaps\nusing the program LMAP, which corrects for the distortion\nof scale\ninherent in the character map output on the printer.\n\n5\n\nqt ~I(~P1-~~\n\n*~J~\'\n\n~RVRFRS\n\n~~\n\n~~~~~~~GOLFCOUSE\n\nCEZK\n\nprogram.)\nplotter, using the\n\n4lteuig\n\n4,r5fyc11)\n\nprogram. )\n\nh\n\nMAP\n\n-"A\n\n6\n\n7all.rmr\n\n"RIVER\n\nOLD SUBURB\n\nCREEK\n\n.\n\nSUBURB\nCONFUSION\n\nI)IINDUSTRY\nUNCLASSIFIED\nSUBURB\n\nFigure\n\n4:\n\nClassification map of industrial\n\nand suburban categories.\n\non the CALCOMP plotter\nLMAP program.)\n\n(Plotted\n\nusing the\n\n7\nTable\n\n1:\n\nDistances of Separation for Some Categories.\nUsed in Mapping the Harrisburg Area\n\nName\n\nNumber\n\nRIVER\nSUBURB CONFUSION\nFIELD\nINDUSTRY 1\nINDUSTRY 2\n\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n\n1\n0.0\n31.8\n31.5\n14.2\n31.4\n\n2\n31.8\n0.0\n1.1\n18.3\n14.2\n\n3\n31.5\n1.1\n0.0\n18.0\n13.8\n\n4\n14.2\n18.3\n18.0\n0.0\n17.7\n\n5\n31.4\n14.2\n13.8\n17.7\n0.0\n\nno problem in classifying this category correctly. A mixture of two\ncategories (4 and 5) was found to consistently appear in industrial\nareas on the initial output. Although these two signatures were relatively widely separated, and thus retained as separate entitites, they\nwere assigned to the same symbol (+), thus yielding a uniformly mapped\narea on the output.\n\nMore work-is required with the category of HIGHWAYS.\nIt comes up well in areas of high subject-to-background contrast, but\nis weak in urban and suburban areas. Perhaps the mapper will have to\nproduce highway networks by the judicious connection of scattered\nsymbols.\n\nThis is not a satisfactory procedure. Other spectrally\nnonhomogeneous targets definable by cluster analysis that are different but worthy of further study are quarries and small streams.\nIn the third and final level of mapping, the thematic map was\nreviewed for clarity. At this stage the resulting map output was too\nrefined and confusing to the reader. Some categories were combined,\nas explained above for the industrial areas. Stray symbols were\nsuppressed using the CLEAN option. A careful review of map objectives\nat this stage served as a guide to the final number of categories to\nbe mapped.\n\nThe final output also includes a table expressing the\npercentage of the area mapped for each category. Figure 5 is the\ncompleted map.\n\nFigures\n\n3 and\n\nrepresents a combination of the maps shown in\n4. However, in order to make the map readable, forest\n\n-It\n\nareas were combined with unclassified areas. The hope of diminishing\nthe unclassified area may rest in the merging of data from scenes for\ndifferent seasons of the year.\n\n8\n\n4A\n\n"_ I ,> I\n\nN\n:\n\ni,\n\n. \'-\'\n\n$\n\n>%\n\n,\n\n-\n\n\'l: .\'\n\n-0,/,X \',\n\n\'\n\n-k!\'\'\n\n.\n\n,i,\'i\n\n-\n\n5\n\n<::\n\n--- .-\n\n,~\n\n,\n\nk\n\n.\n\n.\n\n-- :.\n\n" -"\n\nJ\n\n:-kT>(\n\n: ,\n\ni\'.\n\n.\n\nX\':\n\nI X:\n\n.\n\n\' -\n\n" "\n\n\'":\n\n,,\'r.-. \xc2\xa3 <<< +k4:~::::.:\n\n,:::\n\nlip\n\n............ - " ....... ,.\n-4....

The categories of water, forests, high density suburbs,\nold suburbs, industrial areas, and parking lots and concrete were\nreasonably well defined.\n2. The categories of agricultural fields, highways, and low\ndensity suburbs need more study.\n3.\n\nSome items highly desirable in land use mapping may not\n\nbe obtained because of small size or low subject-to-background contrast.\n4. The temporal aspect of the data has not yet been sufficiently exploited.\n5.\n\nThe combined efforts of interpretation of ERTS images,\n\naircraft underflight photographs, and computer-generated character maps\nhas the potential to generate land-use maps of high quality.\nIt should be added that subsequent efforts to further refine the\ntechniques described here were hampered by the inability to pinpoint\nsmall geographic areas on the thematic maps because of the line-andelement distortion inherent in the character maps generated by the\nprinter.\nLomb.\n\nORSER has just received a Zoom Transferscope from Bausch and\n\nThe use of this device with color transparencies of underflight\n\nphotography should offer great improvement over the method of simple\nprojection, because of the differential scale adjustments possible with\nthis instrument.\nAircraft underflight data are vitally important to the ultimate\nrefinement of thematic maps from ERTS digital data.\n\nIn order to make\n\nmaximum use of the photointerpreter in the establishment of signatures,\nit is necessary to provide images at a larger scale than that of ERTS-1\nMSS prints, in order that microfeatures may be read.\n\nAs these features\n\nare properly identified with underflight data, they can be used to\nestablish computer processed signatures for subsequent mapping of large\nareas.\n\nORSER-SSEL Technical Report 14-73\nThe Pennsylvania State University\nMay 1973\n\n'
