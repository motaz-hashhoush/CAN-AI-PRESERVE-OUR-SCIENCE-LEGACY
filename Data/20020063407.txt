b'Early Warning Signs\nCommercial Benefits\xe2\x80\x94Spinoffs\n\nT\n\nhe tiniest cracks may spell big trouble for\naging aircraft. Fatigue damage of sufficient\nsize and density can weaken metal, leading to\npossible failure of a structure.\nThrough Small Business Innovation Research\n(SBIR) contracts with NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Goddard Space Flight\nCenter, JENTEK\xc2\xae Sensors, Inc., of Watertown,\nMassachusetts, is now offering a system for nondestructive material evaluation, including thermal spray\ncoating for characterization of porosity and thickness.\nJENTEK\xc2\xae developed the GridStation\xe2\x84\xa2 Measurement System, based in part on a NASA need for\ncharacterizing anodic coating thickness, spacecraft\ncontamination, and thermal barrier coatings. The\ninnovation can provide age degradation monitoring,\nincluding fatigue, corrosion, and thermal aging in\nnumerous materials, such as ceramics, composites,\nand metals.\nJENTEK\xc2\xae markets two devices. The first, called\nthe Meandering Winding Magnetometer (MWM\xe2\x84\xa2),\nis used for conducting, as well as for magnetic media.\nThe other, known as the InterDigital Electrode\nDielectrometer (IDED), is used for relatively\ninsulating media. With the MWM\xe2\x84\xa2, JENTEK\xc2\xae\xe2\x80\x99s\nfirst commercialized sensor product, magnetic fields\nare used to inspect conducting materials, such as\nmetals, both magnetic and nonmagnetic. The\nMWM\xe2\x84\xa2 can spot miniscule cracks down to oneto two-millionths of an inch in depth. By\ncomparison, conventional devices that use eddy\ncurrent cannot generally find cracks of that size.\nIndeed, this capability is essential because clusters of\nmicroscopic cracks can affect the service life of a\nstructure.\nTo reveal the microscopic cracks, the MWM\xe2\x84\xa2\nsignals are induced by specially configured\nconformable sensor arrays. These arrays minimize the\nrequirement for precise positioning of the device and\npermit mounting the sensors permanently at any\ncritical location for continuous monitoring of fatigue.\nAlso, because this advanced device uses conformable\nsensors, it can inspect not only flat surfaces, but also\nconvex, concave, and conical surfaces. Accurate\nproperty determinations can be obtained, regardless\nof the shape of the part being tested. For some\napplications, sensor scanning can be done at a\nfast-paced rate, up to 2 feet per second. An initial\ncalibration of the sensor system in the laboratory\npermits the measurement of a wide variety of\nmaterials, without requiring the operator to use any\nstandards or reference parts. JENTEK\xc2\xae has rigorously\n\ntested the system for performing very early stage crack\ndetection in stainless steel, aluminum, and other\nmaterials.\nUsed with the company\xe2\x80\x99s product line of sensors,\nJENTEK\xc2\xae\xe2\x80\x99s GridStation\xe2\x84\xa2 is a fully integrated and\nportable nondestructive property measurement\nsystem. Current and potential applications for the\nJENTEK\xc2\xae MWM\xe2\x84\xa2 and IDED sensors include\ncharacterization of coatings, fatigue damage mapping,\ncrack detection and sizing, applied and residual stress\nmeasurement on ferromagnetic materials, object\ndetection, material identification, and cure monitoring. On-line fatigue monitoring can be done in\ndifficult-to-access locations on complex structures,\nsuch as aircraft, bridges, and heavy manufacturing\nequipment. The software environment uses measurement grid modules to convert impedance measurements to property estimates in real-time without\nrequiring user interpretation. The data are stored in a\n\xe2\x80\x9cGrid Library.\xe2\x80\x9d\nWhile Goddard first considered use of the innovation for its spacecraft building and validation work,\nthe Glenn Research Center capitalized the innovation\nand utilized the system to characterize ceramic\nthermal barrier coatings for turbine blade applications.\nThe thermal barrier coatings allow operation of the\nturbine blades at higher temperatures. Monitoring the\nproperties and degradation of the ceramic coatings,\nthe metallic bond coat, and the super alloy blade\nmaterial would provide for preventative maintenance,\nas opposed to costly unscheduled repairs when failures\noccur.\nNeil Goldfine, JENTEK\xc2\xae\xe2\x80\x99s president, says the\nNASA SBIR contract work helped advance the\ncompany\xe2\x80\x99s product into the commercial market.\nJENTEK\xc2\xae has sold and delivered GridStation\xe2\x84\xa2\nmeasurement systems with JENTEK\xc2\xae MWM\xe2\x84\xa2 and\nIDED sensors to customers in government agencies,\nas well as those in the private sector.\nJENTEK\xc2\xae is a registered trademark of JENTEK Sensors, Inc.\nGridStationTM and MWMTM are trademarks of JENTEK Sensors, Inc.\n\nComputer Technology\n\n67\n\nJentek \xc2\xae Sensors\xe2\x80\x99\nGridstation\xe2\x84\xa2\nMeasurement\nSystem can provide\nage degradation\nmonitoring,\nincluding fatigue,\ncorrosion, and\nthermal aging in\nnumerous\nmaterials.\n\n'
