A source of balanced alternating electrical energy for energizing the circuit is coupled between the commonly connected plates of the first pair of capacitors and the commonly connected plates of the second pair of capacitors. Due to the operation of the diode bridge, the sum of the resultant charges developed on the first pair of capacitors is proportional to the relationship between the respective capacitors of the second pair, and consequently, an output voltage taken across the first pair of capacitors will be proportional to that relationship.", "title": "Diode-quad bridge circuit means", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-03T10:39:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19750011448, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Harrison, D.
