Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas, is tasked with providing a real-time simulator for developing displays and controls targeted for the Space Station Freedom. These displays and controls will exist inside an enclosed workstation located on the space station. The simulation is currently providing the engineering analysis environment for NASA and contractor personnel to design, prototype, and test alternatives for graphical presentation of data to an astronaut while he performs specified tasks. A highly desirable aspect of this environment is to have the capability to rapidly develop and bring on-line a number of different displays for use in determining the best utilization of graphics techniques in achieving maximum efficiency of the test subject fulfilling his task. The Systems Engineering Simulator now has available a tool which assists in the rapid development of displays for these graphic workstations. The Display Builder was developed in-house to provide an environment which allows easy construction and modification of displays within minutes of receiving requirements for specific tests.", "title": "SES cupola interactive display design environment", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T15:13:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19900011363, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Vu, Bang Q."}, "organization": {"name": "Lockheed Missiles and Space Co.", "location": "Huntsville, AL, United States"}}, "id": "f2dc8ee4ffce4ddab53f05185593d79c"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19900011363, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Kirkhoff, Kevin R."}, "organization": {"name": "Lockheed Missiles and Space Co.", "location": "Huntsville, AL, United States"}}, "id": "46765332872d4134861837d7e7c3fdf5"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19900011363, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19900011363, "id": "8230f6a4c34b416980e4964e59bc5d17", "publicationName": "NASA, Lyndon B.
