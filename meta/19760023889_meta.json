The filter has a transmission of 38% in polarized light. Its full width at half maximum is .09A at 5500A. It is tunable from 4500 to 8500A by means of stepping motor actuated rotating half wave plates and polarizers. Wave length commands and thermal compensation commands are generated by a PPD 11/10 minicomputer. The alternate partial polarizer universal filter is compared with the universal birefringent filter and the design techniques, construction methods, and filter performance are discussed in some detail. Based on the experience of this filter some conclusions regarding the future of birefringent filters are elaborated.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19760023889, "id": "06a1ed5827354fa39865b8885aa45b91", "publicationDate": "1976-03-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19760023889.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19760023889/downloads/19760023889.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19760023889/downloads/19760023889.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19760023889/downloads/19760023889.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
