During the last seven years, the Dept. of Communications has been meeting with potential MSAT users in government and the private sector as part of a $20M Communications Trials Program. User trials will be conducted using leased capacity as well as capacity on Canada's MSAT satellite. User requirements are discussed which were identified under the Communications Trials Program. Land, marine, aeronautical, and fixed applications are described from the perspective of the end users. Emphasis is placed on field trials being accomplished using leased capacity such as the marine data trial being implemented by Ultimateast Data Communications, trials using transportable briefcase terminals and additional field trials being considered for implementation with the TMI Mobile Data Service. The pre-MSAT trials that will be conducted using leased capacity are only a limited sample of the overall end user requirements that have been identified to date. Additional end user applications are discussed, along with a summary of user benefits.", "title": "Canadian MSAT field trial program user requirements", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T17:24:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19920014946, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Pedersen, Allister"}, "organization": {"name": "Communications Research Centre", "location": "Ottawa Ontario, Canada"}}, "id": "c470694a4d3f4abf802adce78eb5a0ef"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19920014946, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19920014946, "id": "bcaa92b74dd14ae1b1c21e45f662174b", "publicationName": "JPL, California Inst. of Tech., Proceedings of the 2nd International Mobile Satellite Conference (IMSC 1990)", "publicationDate": "1990-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19920014946.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19920014946/downloads/19920014946.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19920014946/downloads/19920014946.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19920014946/downloads/19920014946.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
