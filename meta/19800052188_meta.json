It was found that the durations of the SBs were either relatively short (less than about 10 min) or relatively long (longer than about 3 hours). Using the minimum variance technique, it was found that the SB surfaces were inclined appreciably with respect to the ecliptic at this epoch of the solar cycle (1971-1973). Magnetic holes were found in thick SBs at a rate about three times that elsewhere. In addition, an analysis of tangential discontinuities showed that their orientations were generally not related to the orientations of the SB surface, but their characteristics were very similar to those for discontinuities outside the SBs.", "title": "Interplanetary sector boundaries 1971-1973", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-10T11:13:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19800052188, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Klein, L."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Goddard Space Flight Center", "location": "Greenbelt, MD, United States"}}, "id": "14c129606e244f62b696d1f67a42600b"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19800052188, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Burlaga, L.
