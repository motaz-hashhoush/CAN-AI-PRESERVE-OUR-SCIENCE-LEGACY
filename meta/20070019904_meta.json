Since spacecraft design limits crew size, the medical assignment may be handled by a single astronaut-physician or by a crew member trained as a physician's assistant. In a space emergency demanding surgery, for instance, sophisticated communications equipment, backed by a computerized data processing system, would make it possible for a surgeon on Earth to \"examine\" the patient. He could study X-rays and other data, specify an in-flight surgical procedure, and guide the astronaut-medic step-by-step through the operation. Such a system is being evaluated now. It is called STARPAHC (Space Technology Applied to Rural Papago Health Care). NASA technology in space communications and data processing is being applied to remote health services for the Papago tribe. STARPAHC is administered by the NASA Life Sciences Directorate in the Office of Space Sciences. It is a joint program involving NASA's Johnson Space Center, the Indian Health Service of the Department of Health, Education & Welfare, and the Papago's Executive Health Council. Lockheed Missiles & Space Co. is NASA's systems support contractor.", "title": "Innovations in Medicine", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-23T23:04:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-09-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20070019904, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20070019904, "id": "fd002e721bdc4997bc9b8e9f77a2ab9b", "publicationName": "Spinoff 1977", "publicationDate": "1977-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20070019904.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20070019904/downloads/20070019904.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20070019904/downloads/20070019904.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20070019904/downloads/20070019904.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
