With the anticipated high\nlaunch frequency, at least partially reusable space transporters\nare again re,eiving serious consideration as success , -.-s to the\nbooster rocket family named "Ariane" [15].\n\nThis report introduces a novel spact transporter concept,\ndeveloped at the University of Stuttgart and compares the results\nwith recently published studies of several other European space\ntransporter concepts.\t\n\nThis project is a part of the Special\n\nInvestigations Area 85 and has been supported by the Deutsche\nForschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) [German Research Society\nand the Commonwealth of Baden-Wurttemberg since 1971.\n2.\n\nThe Concept of Istra3\n\nAir-breathing space transporter concepts have been and aro- being\ngenerally investigated in conjuction with two-stage winged\n*Numbers in right-hand margin indicate pagination in original.\n\'Speech at the annual convention of the Deutsche Gesellschaft\nfdr Luft- and Raumfahrt (DGLR), Stuttgart, October 5-7, 1982.\nDGLR copy 82-075.\n2 Licensed engineer P.

Literary source\n[4] compares the concept in this report with primarily American\nstudies of the last 10 to 15 years involving such investigations.\nThis shows how the high construction Pxpense of air-breathing\nspace transporters as described above nearly eradicates the\nadvantages of air-breathing engines--lower propellant consumption\nthan with rockets of similar thrust.\n\nThe concept of "Istra" is based on a 1-1/2-stage reusable\nballistic round-trip space transporter with vertical take off and\nlanding.\n\nThe engine consists of separately installed dual ramjets\t\n\n/238\n\nworking in parallel and rockets using liquid hydrogen (LH2),\nliquid oxygen (LOX) and air. The ramjets build a ring out of 28\nmodules, which are grouped around a central, reusable ballistic\nrocket unit, as Figure 1 shows.\n5\n\n1\n\nd^\ni\n\ni. 5\t\n\nn\t\n\nT A A 1\n\n_\n0V\n\nFigure 1: Basic construction of the "Istra" integral ramjet rocket\n4\n\nThe central rocket unit was originally designed by the firm\nMesserpchmitt-Bolkow-Blohm (8,9). \t\n\nRocket engines of this design\n\nwere replaced by mainstream high-pressure rocket engines with\ndual-positioned jets and were transferred from the periphery into\nthe base of the system behind flaps in the heat shield.\n\nTechnology from modern aircraft developments, currently available\nor planned for the the near future (for example (101), was\nadapted for the LH 2 -ramjet engines with subsonic stream flow and\nvariable geometry and for the central rocket unit. The gross\nlift off mass of "Istra" amounts to only about 155 Mg.\t\n\nThe\n\nentire design was intended for a relatively simple reusable\nsystem for European conditions.\n\nP.gure 2:\n\n"Istra" flight sequence\n\nFigure 2 shows the flight sequence:\t\n\nVertical lift off with\n\nrocket engines, at M > 1 ignition and parallel operation of\nramjets to about M = 2, disengaging of the rocket engines and\nacceleration alone through ramjets up to stage separation at\nabout M = 6.5 at altitudes in excess of 40 km.\t\n\nThere the ramjet\n\nring separates and is sheltered with parachutes. The central\nrocket unit continues to accelerate to LEO (200 km), unloads the\npayload, turns, brakes with rocket thrust and returns with the\nheat shield preceding it on a ballistic course to the Earth\'s\nsurface.\t\n\nLanding takes place on landing struts with rocket\n\nthrust.\n\n5\n\nIn addition to this 1-1/2-stage concept, a purely single-stage\ndesign was calculated in detail for purposes of comparison.\n3. Analysis Technique\nThe method of analysis, as well as the assumptions and\nconditions surrounding it, have been published in previous\nreports [2 to 4, 6].\t\n\nIt will be dealt with only briefly here.\n\nThe basic idea is an approach to calculating orbit as in rocket\ntechnology:\t\n\nVertical start and largely ballistic ascent with\n\ngravity deflection. The engine for this pronounced acceleration\nmission should work at fullest possible thrust, so long as no\ncritical boundaries, in particular regarding structure stress,\nare exceeded.\t\n\nIn such a situation the engine must be throttled.\n\nThis procedure contrasts otherwise usual system concepts for airbreathing engines, which generally utilize a trajectory\nspecification in the form of a high Mach-number combination (for\nexample, constant ramming pressure). Such a specification\nsimplifies propulsion calculation, since the power of airbreathing propulsions is dependent not only upon the flight\naltitude as with rocket propulsions, but also very much ipon the\nactual Mach-number.\n\nThis specification, on the other hand, impedes technical\nrealization, since the engines must be used up for maximum\nthrust, while nearly always being throttled, in order to follow\nthis "unnatural" course.\t\n\nBeyond that, it is not possible to\n\nmaintain this course without additional significant aerodynamic\nlift.\n-figure 3 shows the two different types of paths. One path with\np dyn - 1 x 10 5 Pa (= 1 bar) is mentioned frequently in the\nliterature. At high Mach-numbers it leads to excessive\n\n6\n\n\t\n\ncombustion -hamber presE.ures in the ramjet engines.\t\n\nThis\n\nnecessitates very speedy stage separation or conversion to\nsupersonic flow.\t\n\n_\t\n7,\t\n\n70\t\n\nCourse 1\t\n\nRocket launch\t\n\n)0\n\n70\t\n\n`^ r\n\n/239\n\nY,\n\n7\t\n.D\t\n\nAl\n\ny..,.^\t\n\n-\t\n\ny\t\n\nb\t\n\n_\n_\n.0\n700C\n\n\t -^0\n\n2 Ramjets on 3 Rockets out\n\n4 Stage separation\n\nFigure 3:\t\n\nTrajectory profile "Istra" over the isolines of\nthe specific impulse of the ramjet engines.\nBoundary lines for dynamic pressure and ramjetcombustion chamber pressure\nKey:\t\n\nA) Ramjet B) Trajectory\n\nIn project "Istra", on the other hand, a complete engine data\nbank is set up beforehand for every conceivable flight situation\nan,l every engine stage. \t\n\nThus, any arbitrary trajectory can occur\n\nduring flight regardless of stage. \t\n\nFigure 3 includes a field of\n\nisolines of the specific impulse of the ramjet. engines.\n\nAt the end of a trajectory calculation, when sufficient payload\nis available, the engine stress is checked. A trajectory course\nis set as the intersection, once again using the data fields of\nthe engine data bank, to determine the manner and duration of the\ncritical load.\n\nFigures 4 and 5 plot combustion chamber pressure (static) and\ntemperature (total) along two typical paths.\t\n\nThe flatter path\n\noccurs when the rocket engi^.je is reconnected parallel to the\nramjet engine before stage separation to increase thrust. This\neffect was optimized in the results described in (7]. \t\n\nAs\n\n7\n\nff\n\nFigure 4 or 5 shows, no excessive stress occurs in the ramjet\ncombustion chamber.\t\n\nIn particular, combustion chamber pressure\n\nremains below 15 x 10 5 Pa ( z 15 bar).\n\nM 50\nIkml\n\n5 P^\n\n1\nk\n\n30\n20\n\n,0\n\n0\n4\t\n\n3\t\n\n1S 2\t\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\ne\t\n\nFigure 4: Two trajectory profiles up to stage separation\nover the isolines of the static ramjet combustion\nchamber pressure\n\xe2\x80\x9e\n\nso\nI\t\n\n;kml\n1\n\nr\t\n^\n\t\n\n\'0\n\n/ \t/\n\nT\nI\n\ni\t\n\ni\n\n__\n\nI\n\n30\n\n70\n\n\'C\n\n0\ni} ]\t\n\n3\t\n\nc\t\n\n5\t\n\n6\t\n\n7\t\n\ns\n\nM.\n\nFigure 5:\t\n\nTwo trajectory profiles lip to stage separation\nover the isolines of the total ramjet combustion\nchamber temperature\n\nAn interactive design and analysis process provides interplay of\nsystem design through parameter variation and engine analysis\n[6].\t\n\nAfter finding sat.isfa-tory total solutions the result can\n\n8\n\n\t\n\nbe optimized with methods as in [7].\t\n\nThis allows further\n\nparameters, like, for exemple, thrust engagement and aerodynamic\nlift, to be considered.\n4. Results and Comparisons\nIf the corresponding specific impulse of the ramjet engine\n\'thrust in seconds (,f propeP ant mass consumed, Ns/kg) along the\ntrajectory it Figure 3 runs its course over flight time, the\nsituation shown in Figure 6 occurs.\n\nFigure 6:\t\n\nSpecific impulse over flight time:\t\n131mcn\t\n\nI.

These results are based on assumpLions of nodern structure_\nand engine technology. The necessary ramjet technology need&\nto be adapted from aircraft use to aerospace needs. \t\n\nThis is\n\nnot a novel idea in aerospace history.\n\n4\t\n\nHydrogen is the\xe2\x80\xa2 suitable r\xc2\xbbel for this use.\t\n\nBecause of low\n\npropellant requirements in the first stage, its normal\ndisadvantage--low specific volume density--no longer tis a\ndisadvantageous effect.\n\n5. A relatively small 155-Mg heavy space transporter with over\n15 Mg net mass in lower orbits is a very promising solution\nfor European needs following the of non-retrievable rockets\nin the "Ailtane" series. \t\n\nFuture studies and technology\n\nprograms supported \')y industry and advanced r.\t\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2ch\n\ninstitutes must. inve,tigate to what extent dev io;w ent\nexpenditures and perio.,s fit into European ecor\xe2\x80\x9e wic and time\nrequirements.\n\nIn appreciation\nThe authors wish tc thank the Deutsche- \xe2\x96\xba orschungsgemeinschaft\n(Ger,aan Research Society) and the Commonwealth of Baden -Wuerttemberg for the\ncontinuing support of this project by the Special Research Section 8S of the\nUniversity of Stuttgart.\n\n13\n\nREFERENCES\n\n1.\n\n"Future space transportation\nD.
