Introduction\n\nT\n\nAKING into account the human element and protecting for human health is critical towards having a successful\nmission. Many elements of the mission contribute towards the necessary habitable volume design and planning.\nThe Asteroid Redirect Mission merges the Orion Program\xe2\x80\x99s capabilities with the Orion vehicle with the newly\nproposed Asteriod Redirect Vehicle (ARV) to capture and retrieve an asteroid, move to a deep retrograde orbit\n(DRO) around the moon, and then send a crew out to procure a sample to return to earth for sample analysis.\nThe Asteroid Redirect Crewed Mission is expected to leverage off the Orion spacecraft accommodations to meet\nthe new mission design parameters. Orion has been designed to enable crew transportation missions of less than one\nmonth in duration. All of the daily habitability functions must be accommodated within the spacecraft.

The oth early design mission for O\nn\nher\nn\nOrion was to s\nserve as a crew transport veh\nw\nhicle to\nand from the Internation Space Statio (ISS) and for these missi\nt\nnal\non\nf\nions the crew w\nwould spend e\neven less time in the\nvehicle. It was a non-val\nt\nlidated assump\nption early in th Orion progra that the oth spacecraft\xe2\x80\x99s mass and vol\nhe\nam\nher\nlume \xe2\x80\x93\ne.g. Altair, Lunar Outpos Lunar Rove ISS, etc. wo\n,\nst,\ner,\nould provide th needed capa\nhe\nabilities to off the physiol\nfset\nlogical\nand psycho\nological decon\nnditioning expe\nerienced in the Orion such a for exercise needs. For i\ne\nas\ne\ninstance, early Crew\ny\nExploration Vehicle (Or\nrion) Net Habi\nitable Volume studies made the assumptio that becaus the vehicle would\non\nse\nonly spend a few days in flight before reaching ISS the crew wo\nd\ne\nS,\nould exclusivel use exercise equipment an not\nly\ne\nnd\nrequire an exercise capab\nbility onboard the vehicle.4\nt\nt\ncellation of the Constellation Program and the planned lunar sortie missions, the Orion\ne\nn\nd\nd\nAfter the 2010 canc\nvehicle\xe2\x80\x99s purpose was ad\np\ndjusted to support Low Earth Orbit (LEO) p\npoints of intere Near Earth Objects, lunar orbit,\nest,\nr\nearth-moon Lagrange points and the IS Orion was asked to conti\nn\nSS.\ninue to protect for the ability to rendezvou with\nt\ny\nus\nadditional habitation and lander elem\nd/or\nments in LEO to carry a crew to a near ear asteroid, M\nw\nrth\nMoon, Martian M\nMoon,\n2\nAmeric Institute of Aeronautics a Astronauti\ncan\nf\nand\nics\n\nor even Mars.

Some aspects \xe2\x80\x93\nsuch as a smaller crew of two \xe2\x80\x93 may make internal operational plans easier, while others \xe2\x80\x93 such as suiting up and\nusing the Orion capsule as an airlock \xe2\x80\x93 are likely to add additional complexity to planned mission operations.\n\nV. Human Factors Design Technical Challenges\nA. General Design\nEngineering the vehicle design to incorporate the crewed volume while minimizing mass and volume impacts is\nnot an easy task. Multiple systems have to be planned for and integrated to provide the needed access and control\npoints when needed while minimizing the piping, cabling and other structural adaptations needed so as to reduce\nrouting and improve access to the needed operational locations. For example, the umbilical routing for air delivery\nto the MACES suits are being assessed for the most efficient routing. Current plans would require about 44 ft.\nconfigured to reach each crew around the seats and to avoid snagging.\nIn 2013 some human-in-the-loop (HITL) testing with a mockup of the Orion vehicle was conducted to evaluate\nthe impact of changes to the seat attachment and attenuation system especially in the areas of crew egress and\nhabitability. The teams assessed impacts to major systems such as WMS access, volume, and obstructions, stowage\nlocker accessibility, radiation shelter entry/exit, exercise locations, and post-landing ready-access water locations.\nThese assessments helped to inform emergency equipment re-locations and whether proposed internal configuration\nchanges were viable.\nThe updated EM-2 mission and the supporting validation activities will continue to inform and identify other\npotential adjustments needed to accommodate the mission concept changes for the vehicle from the original concept.\nB. Stowage\nAll of the flight crew equipment must be safely stowed or restrained for launch, launch aborts, and entry. This\nequipment includes everything the crew needs that the vehicle does not otherwise provide, such as food, change of\nclothes, laptop, or solid waste containers. All these items must be volumetrically accommodated within the\nspacecraft. Because of Orion\xe2\x80\x99s small size, the available stowage volumes are irregularly shaped. The items to be\n11\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nstowed within Orion are also non-uniform in shape. This creates organizational challenges to find a logical\nallocation of equipment to the available Orion stowage volumes.\nOne important consideration is accessibility. When crew members need to access a particular item, it is helpful\nto minimize the amount of other stowed items that must be moved in order to gain access to the item in question.\nThis is particularly important with respect to management of small items. One driving design consideration is the\ncrew access of equipment after splashdown. The crew will be physiologically deconditioned after several weeks in\nmicrogravity and the spacecraft will be floating on the ocean, thus subject to disorienting and disruptive wave\nmotion. The crew may need to access emergency equipment under these conditions. They should not need to\nunstow unnecessary items to access post-landing equipment nor should they need to assume difficult postures to do\nso.\nSeparation of food and waste is another design driver for stowage. Orion begins the mission with a large\nquantity of stowed food and no human waste. By the end of the mission the food volume has been largely\nconsumed and there is a large quantity of human waste and trash, but it is unpalatable to stow the human waste\nwhere the food is stowed, leading to a driver for management of both food and waste stowage volumes.\nThe ARC mission requires mission-unique items to be stowed either within the standard cabin stowage volumes\nbeneath the seats or on cabin mounts. These items include equipment to support the EVAs and the sample return\ncontainer. A feasibility study was conducted to assess whether the ARC mission equipment would fit within the\nremaining volume left after accommodating the typical Orion flight crew equipment for this crew size and mission\nduration. Volumes of both sets of items were increased by 30% to account for packing inefficiencies (typically\n20%) and an additional uncertainty of 10%. The total adjusted volume of all stowed items for the ARM were within\nthe total stowed volume the vehicle can accommodate. As the ARM planning matures, it will build off of the EM-2\nstowage work to examine which bays the ARM equipment would fit within while meeting the other design\nconsiderations previously described.\nC. Exercise\nExercise in general can be difficult to\nTable 3. Mean percent change on Shuttle landing day from\ninclude in vehicle design.

Operationally Orion could\nsupport up to an hour per crew per day for four crew, however the protocol objectives are to complete the required\nexercise needed in 30 minutes per crew per day. Exercise is primarily used to counteract the muscle and aerobic\nlosses experienced in the on-orbit environment; however, exercise requires a relatively large operational volume\nwithin the vehicle. Of the many vehicle design integration aspects required to incorporate exercise, some of the\nmost difficult to accommodate can be identifying the space required to allow for crew movement with the equipment\nand designing atmospheric systems that can process the higher CO2, heat, and humidity created during exercise.\n\n12\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nFigure 12.

Contingency Challenges\nWhile some aspects of contingency planning seem obvious \xe2\x80\x93 such as positioning equipment where it can be\nconveniently accessed, other concerns are not as obvious. One of the challenges in a small space vehicle is\nprotecting the crew from radiation events. Should an event be detected in time, the plan is for the crew to shift\nequipment and take shelter in the central stowage compartments under the front two seats. The removed stowed\nitems would be placed around\nTable 4.

The\nSupport and Ambulatory Care, Basic Surgical Care\namount of medical capability is\nbased on a combination of duration of the mission, complexity of the mission and access to additional care. Orion\nnominal operational plans require a Level III level of care (See Table 4).\n\nFigure 15. An example mobility aid to assist the second row crew to exit their seats\nThe ARCM mission introduction of EVAs also introduces additional medical contingency planning. Medical is\na perhaps understated impact of adding EVAs. EVAs can create physical trauma that can require minor medical\ntreatment. Specific injuries related to EVAs can include decompression sickness, shoulder injuries, fingernail\ntrauma, and other hand injuries. These injuries are not likely to occur during IVA activity and therefore may not be\naddressed by the Orion medical outfitting planned for EM-2. Orion\xe2\x80\x99s planned medical kit contains medicine, first15\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\naid supplies, and basic life support equipment for minor medical situations not requiring extensive treatment. EVArelated injuries cannot be mitigated through crew selection and may require the appropriate hardware to be added to\nthe medical kit or adoption of a risk posture to not treat injuries incurred as the result of nominal EVA operations.\nUpon an off-nominal landing event that would cause issues such as problems with maintaining the Command\nModule\xe2\x80\x99s floatation or providing a toxic interior cabin environment, the crew would need to rapidly egress the\nvehicle. Vehicle design planning to protect for this capability requires that the activities such as configuring the\ncrew\xe2\x80\x99s survival gear, deploying the life raft, and egressing the side (or top) hatch also needs to take into account the\naerobically and muscularly deconditioned crew that may be experiencing orthostatic intolerance effects. Exercise is\nmeant to help mitigate the aerobic and muscular deconditioning, while other mitigations are being investigated to\nmitigate the other orthostatic intolerance effects. Mobility aids are being assessed (See Fig. 15) to help crew exit\ntheir seats.\nG. Sleep Locations and Meal Planning\nAlthough several approaches are being reviewed, there are no defined locations for crew sleep or meal planning.\nFor crew sleep it is assumed that crew members will strap crew restraints to random surfaces of the cabin. Limited\nCAD modeling demonstrated that it is possible to position four crew members in sleep-like postures. However,\nmany factors that have not yet been modeled will drive which sleep positions are actually viable, such as internal\ntemperature variations, humidity, noise, and lighting.\nGiven the small size of the vehicle volume, there is no constraint to maintain meal consumption within a specific\ndistance of meal preparation equipment. Consequently, cabin configuration for meals will be a matter of crew\npreference. The primary constraint will be mitigation of task interference between crew member(s) responsible for\nmeal preparation. This will likely mean that any meal preparation or clean up is done in an area that is not used for\naccess to vehicle displays and controls, nor the WMS, nor exercise. This suggests either the aft bulkhead, or the\nceiling above the WMS, or potentially a corner outboard of the display and control panel. Crew dining locations\nwill probably vary from crew to crew, and possibly from meal to meal, but when all four crew eat as a group the\ncenter of the cabin volume will likely be a popular volume. When individual crew members eat alone, they will\nprobably find the most comfortable, \xe2\x80\x9cout of the way\xe2\x80\x9d corner to occupy.\nH. Trash\nThe plan for trash management is also still in developmental stages. Crew waste is expected to use the same\nWMS cans with charcoal odor filters that were used successfully on Shuttle. Food disposal plans are still in work to\nidentify effective storage solutions that can contain both the trash and the odors effectively as Orion does not have\nthe constant ventilation system that kept odors down in Shuttle. Stowage teams will also need to identify how to\nmanage trash location so that food is kept apart from waste and other trash items. The trace contaminant control\nsystem may be able to help remove odors from the compartment, but will not limit the odors at the sources of the\nconcerns \xe2\x80\x93 nor is the level of performance capability well understood just yet.\n\nVI. Adjusting to New Mission Paradigms\nThere are particular philosophies that consciously or subconsciously guide the assumptions and decisions that\nare made by engineers within any given industry. Within the space industry there are a number of paradigms that\nhave formed as the result of more than fifty years of human spaceflight. However, these paradigms are shaped by\nparticular experiences that are not valid in all spaceflight architectures. The majority of human spaceflight\nexperience is within Low Earth Orbit, which has given rise to paradigms that may be harmful in missions taking\nplace beyond this regime.\nIn flight maintenance philosophies have been heavily driven by our LEO experience. The Space Shuttle program\nemployed a philosophy known as Redundancy Management (RM), where the Orbiter spacecraft employed\nfunctional redundancy in all critical systems, such that if any given component failed there was a backup component\nready to take over its function. Flight rules were established to determine how long the vehicle could rely on\nbackups and once a particular threshold was crossed, the crew was required to immediately prepare the vehicle for\ndeorbit and conduct a mission abort. Multiple runways were on standby around the world, such that the crew could\nreturn home at any time. Once on the ground, the Orbiter would be repaired and placed back in the launch\npreparation flow.\nThe International Space Station cannot land, so unlike the shuttle it employed an Orbital Replacement Unit\n(ORU) philosophy. In this case, should any component fail, either the function would be suspended or a backup\nwould take over. Meanwhile, a replacement would be scheduled for installation \xe2\x80\x93 whether the replacement unit was\n16\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nalready on the station or it needed to be launched on an upcoming logistics resupply flight. In the event of a failure\nthat left the station uninhabitable, it could always be abandoned with the crew taking a docked spacecraft to land on\nEarth.\nBoth RM and ORU philosophies break down beyond LEO. At a DRO, trajectories are constrained both by\ndistance and orbital phasing. There are specific windows where spacecraft can transit back to Earth. Unlike the\nshuttle, an Orion at a DRO is days away from an Earth return and cannot operate with nonfunctional critical system\nduring a return cruise. Also unlike the ISS, the Orion will not receive regular logistics resupply flights. Thus, a new\nmaintenance philosophy is needed that will be appropriate to Orion missions in DRO.\nA similar challenge is faced in the area of crew health. Both ISS and Shuttle enjoyed the luxury of their\nproximity to the surface of the Earth. Hospital-quality medical care was never more than 72 hours away for an\norbiting space crew. At DRO such medical care is as much as one to two weeks away from the point of declaration\nof an emergency. This implies the need to develop a new paradigm for the maintenance of crew medical care.\nWhat is the philosophy on trash? Shuttle missions were typically 14 days or fewer and trash was stored in\nspecialized compartments, some of which used vacuum venting as a method of odor control. ISS stores trash in\nlogistics modules which periodically undock from the station and are disposed of by burning them up in the\natmosphere. Orion cannot offload trash to other modules and the capsule does not have any form of vacuum venting\nor other odor control methods.\nFinally, the confinement experienced by Orion crews is unlike prior human spaceflight experience. Both\nSkylab and ISS missions have exceeded ARM missions in duration, but with considerably greater habitable volumes\nand much more diverse crew tasks. The physiological and psychological challenges of the much smaller Orion\ncapsule presents unknown challenges. Apollo crews (and some shuttle crews depending on internal outfitting)\nexperienced similar volumes as Orion, but for much shorter missions. New paradigms in this arena may impact not\nonly crew selection but also crew timelines.\n\nVII. Operational Validation\nIn order to validate the operational plans and identify additional technical challenges, human factors and human\nsystems engineering assessments have peen performed simulating key mission tasks such as crew ingress,\nemergency egress and various systems configurations. As these assessments are done, critical performance factors\nare identified that occasionally lead to internal systems modifications. For example, under the new mission concept,\nthe crew will use the Orion vehicle as an airlock, so room must be available and equipment configured so as not to\ndamage the MACES EVA suits upon egress and entry for all the crew. As those same suits are the safe haven for a\ncabin depressurization event, the suits must also be designed for rapid donning by all crew before the Orion ECLSS\nsystem loses the ability to maintain cabin pressure.\nSeveral methodologies exist that can inform design planning and validate that intended performance criteria\nwere met. Historical data from similar spaceflight programs can qualitatively help in assessing planned numbers in\na vehicle design \xe2\x80\x93 if both the historical data and design data are well understood for their similarities and\ndifferences. This historical data is often incorporated for use in parametric assessments which can be used to\nqualitatively rate the planned estimates. A \xe2\x80\x9cbottoms-up\xe2\x80\x9d assessment may be used once enough fidelity in the\nplanned implementation is defined wherein known capabilities are defined and understood to the individual items\nand specific implementation details and then integrated up through the various subsystems to provide a vehicle level\nintegration picture. Example analog missions may be used to validate design planning and performance once\nsubsystem components are available for assessment or when operations are sufficiently defined. Analog mission\nactivities can drive consideration of crew timelines and activities in ways that can be otherwise overlooked during\ndesign studies. They can also reveal critical architectural gaps before vehicle maturity has progressed to the point\nwhere corrective measures can become prohibitively expensive. For instance, there may be conflicts between crew\nexercise, mission science, WMS usage, and spacecraft operations that may not show up during standalone humanin-the-loop evaluations of the cabin. However, during a multi-day analog mission evaluation the crew is responsible\nfor completing a specific set of science objectives while responding to spacecraft operation tasks, conducting daily\nexercise, using the WMS, eating, sleeping, and conducting other habitation tasks. In such a scenario it becomes\nreadily apparent when vehicle configuration (volumes, layouts, orientations, and co-locations) negatively impacts\ncrew productivity or safety. Vehicle mock-ups depending on fidelity to planned equipment may provide a 1G\ninsight into operational space, organization, accessibility, and other vehicle system aspects that may be difficult to\nassess in models.\nHowever models play a critical function in vehicle design and planning. A recent assessment incorporating\nhigher fidelity equipment models into the vehicle model identified additional habitation volume was needed for\n17\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\nwiring and tubing that had changed from previous configurations A brief ass\nd\nh\nf\ns.\nh\nped\nsessment with the crew help to\nidentify th best locatio for the pat\nhe\nons\nthways and co\norresponding w updates s as to minim\nwall\nso\nmally interfere with\ne\nplanned op\nperational volume usage. (Se Fig. 16)\nee\nSeveral tools have be developed to perform vir\nl\neen\nrtual configura\nation analyses.

The sooner human factors aspec are\nn\ncts\nintegrated into the process, the more ro\nobust the resul\nlting vehicle an crew system capability w be. Many of the\nnd\nm\nwill\nchallenges faced not jus in Orion bu in most veh\nst\nut\nhicles (air, lan sea, or spa\nnd,\nace) are easier to accommod\nr\ndate if\na\nesign process. When human factors issues emerge late in the design pr\nn\nn\nrocess,\nidentified and addressed early in the de\n18\nAmeric Institute of Aeronautics a Astronauti\ncan\nf\nand\nics\n\nthere are generally fewer options available and those tend to be more expensive and less capable than what could\nhave been accommodated earlier.\nFlying to trans-lunar space carries with it the standard crewed vehicle challenges of designing for appropriate\nspace for the transiting crew, but also introduces additional risks due to the inability to easily return to Earth in\ncontingency situations. The addition of the asteroid mission introduces additional complexities and operational\nchallenges for the crew due to the planned EVAs, sample collections, and longer mission.\nThe Orion is intentionally a small spacecraft compared to the Space Shuttle, which places some limitations on\nthe capabilities of the vehicle to provide the human factors and human health capabilities to support its crew. Other\nlimitations have been built into the vehicle as a result of the design reference missions used to baseline spacecraft\nrequirements. These limitations correspondingly scope how the vehicle may be used in both current and future\noperational paradigms. In some missions, Orion will function as an independent spacecraft, operating as the sole\npressurized volume for a human space mission. However, in other missions it will be necessary to supplement\nOrion with additional pressurized volumes, whether in the form of logistics modules, space habitats, functionspecific modules, or other volumes as dictated by the desired resulting mission capability. Adjustments to the\nchanging mission concepts will continue to be assessed and evaluated against the vehicle performance capabilities.\nUnderstanding how the human interface and interaction considerations drive the vehicle design and operations\nwill not only improve the vehicle but also protect needed capabilities for subsequent missions.\n\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors thank Paul Boehm and Rich Ellenberger for their insights into the latest Orion configuration design\nplans.\n\nReferences\n4\n\nJames C.
