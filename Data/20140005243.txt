Sustainable practices are designed to protect the resources\nand relationships that will enable NASA to thrive as it carries out its mission across space and time. Sustainable\npractices include ethics, corporate governance, workplace diversity and inclusion, community involvement (e.g.,\neducation, outreach, volunteerism), health and safety, and environmental quality. In this report we focus on Ames\nenvironmental sustainability not only as a necessary step to assuring resources are available to sustain future\nendeavors, but also as a means to demonstrate integrity, assure transparency, provide for inclusion, consider impacts\non the larger environment, and protect health and safety of workers and the public.\nDr. S.

With the passage of the Space Act in 1958, the\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) was created, replacing\nthe NACA.\nNASA Ames is one of ten NASA \xef\xac\x81eld installations and is uniquely situated at the\ncore of the research cluster of high-tech companies, universities, and laboratories\nin Silicon Valley that de\xef\xac\x81ne the region\xe2\x80\x99s character. Ames\xe2\x80\x99 wind tunnels, of\xef\xac\x81ce\nbuildings, hangars, and air\xef\xac\x81eld are a signi\xef\xac\x81cant presence in the community. With\nmore than $3.0 billion in capital equipment, 2,300 research personnel and a $600\nmillion annual budget, Ames\xe2\x80\x99 economic impact is signi\xef\xac\x81cant.\n\nArtist rendition of the future NASA Research Park.\n\nA Current Aerial image of Ames and the Research park\n\nCurrently, Ames is making history by forging ahead with its small, inexpensive satellite missions. This dynamic center is at the forefront in astrobiology,\nsupercomputing, robotic lunar exploration, the search for habitable planets,\nintelligent/adaptive systems, advanced thermal protection, and airborne astronomy. Ames also develops strategic private sector partnerships to further space exploration, create innovative technologies, and foster interdisciplinary scienti\xef\xac\x81c discoveries in Earth and space sciences. To \xef\xac\x81nd out more\nabout the exciting work being done at the NASA Ames Research Center visit\nhttp://www.arc.nasa.gov/.\nIn addition, Ames is redeveloping the former Naval Air Station at Moffett Field\ninto the NASA Research Park (NRP). The NRP has been successful in bringing\nin over 70 on-site partners who fully occupy approximately 675,000 square feet\nof leasable space. This ongoing development has produced a collaborative community of government, industry, and academic leaders who are delivering innovation, powering economic growth, and advancing science, technology, engineering\nand math education. Over the next \xef\xac\x81fteen years, the NRP is estimated to have a\npositive economic impact on the area, generating an additional 21,300 local jobs\nand an additional $5.8 billion in annual economic output. To \xef\xac\x81nd out more about\nthe NRP visit http://researchpark.arc.nasa.gov/.\n\nSome of the NRP onsite partners include Carnegie Mellon University,\nSingularity University, and Airship Ventures.\n\nAfter more than 70 years of innovation, NASA Ames looks forward to a future\nof new scienti\xef\xac\x81c advances and breakthrough technologies.\n\nNASA Ames celebrated its 70th anniversary on December 20, 2009.\nEnvironmental Sustainability Report 2011 1\n\nIntroduction\nWelcome to the NASA Ames Research Center\xe2\x80\x99s Environmental Sustainability\nReport for 2011. The following pages highlight the various environmental issues\naddressed at Ames, and the center\xe2\x80\x99s accomplishments over the past two years.\nIn an effort to manage its environmental resources, NASA follows Executive\nOrder (EO) 13423 of January 24, 2007. Additionally, NASA follows EO\n13514 of October 5, 2009, which strengthened many provisions detailed in\nEO 13423. These EOs set broad goals to strengthen environmental, energy,\nand transportation management across Federal agencies. They consolidate\npreviously issued EO\xe2\x80\x99s and require Federal agencies to implement Environmental\nManagement Systems (EMS) at all appropriate organizational levels. They then\nrequire the use of EMS as the primary management approach for addressing\nenvironmental aspects of internal agency operations and activities, including\nenergy and transportation functions. EMS compliance is equivalent to ISO\n14001 compliance. NASA Ames EMS is conformant with the White House\nCouncil of Environmental Quality Requirements.\n\nand its mission is to \xe2\x80\x9cdrive advances in science, technology, and exploration to\nenhance knowledge, education, innovation, economic vitality, and stewardship\nof Earth.\xe2\x80\x9d NASA Ames contributes to the Agency\xe2\x80\x99s overarching strategy of\n\xe2\x80\x9cCommitting to environmental stewardship through Earth observation and\nscience, and the development and use of green technologies and capabilities in\nNASA missions and facilities\xe2\x80\x9d in part through many of the efforts described in\nthe following pages. Ames also celebrates the accomplishments of its personnel\nin furthering Center sustainability goals through annual Earth Day events, the\nAmes Sustainability Award Program, and other activities.\n\nEO 13514: \xe2\x80\x9cSustainability\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cSustainable\xe2\x80\x9d mean to\nCreate and maintain conditions under which humans\nand nature can exist in productive harmony, that permit\nful\xef\xac\x81lling the social, economic, and other requirements\nof present and future generations.\n\nNASA is implementing the EO goals, in large part, through the NASA\nStrategic Sustainability Performance Plan. To implement the plan, the NASA\nAmes Environmental Management Division is spearheading an internal Ames\n\xe2\x80\x98Green Team\xe2\x80\x99 which is focused on strengthening the Center\xe2\x80\x99s environmental\nmanagement system, including outreach through websites, a variety of forums,\nand topical fact sheets. This Green Team participates in the Sustainable Silicon\nValley, and other organizations that share information and collaborate in \xef\xac\x81nding\ncommon solutions to such challenges as clean transportation, energy and water\nconservation, chemical management, and green purchasing.\nSustainability for NASA Ames is consistent with the Space Act of 1958, NASA\npolicy on Environmental Quality (14 CFR subpart 1216.1) and NASA\xe2\x80\x99s strategic\ngoals. The NASA 2011 Strategic Plan vision is to reach for new heights and reveal\nthe unknown, so that what NASA does and learns will bene\xef\xac\x81t all humankind\n\nNASA Ames has received many sustainability awards. See www.\nenvironmentalmanagement.arc.nasa.gov for details.\n\nThe National Environmental Policy Act of 1969\nThe purposes of this Act are: To declare a national\npolicy which will encourage productive and enjoyable\nharmony between man and his environment; to promote\nefforts which will prevent or eliminate damage to the\nenvironment and biosphere and stimulate the health\nand welfare of man; to enrich the understanding of the\necological systems and natural resources important to\nthe Nation; and to establish a Council on Environmental\nQuality.\n\n2 NASA Ames Research Center\n\nEnergy\nEO 13514 Agency-wide Goals for Energy:\n1. Increase renewable energy and renewable energy generation on agency property.\n2. Align Federal policies to increase effectiveness of local planning for energy choices.\n3. Identify and analyze impacts from energy usage and alternative energy sources in all Environmental\nImpact Statements and Environmental Assessments for new or expanded Federal facilities proposals.\n4. Ensure all new Federal buildings planned post-2019 achieve zero-net-energy standards by 2030.\n5. Manage existing buildings to reduce energy consumption.\n6. Ensure 95% of all new contracts, including non-exempt contract modi\xef\xac\x81cations, require energy ef\xef\xac\x81cient\nproducts and services.\n\nEffective energy management is crucial to Ames\xe2\x80\x99 sustainability due to the center\xe2\x80\x99s\nrequirements for both electricity and natural gas for its power. Major energy users\nat Ames are the wind tunnels, arc jet, and supercomputing facilities. Base power\ndemand is 10 to 20 megawatts, but peak demand can be up to 150 megawatts when\nrunning the wind tunnels and/or the arc jet.\nEnergy reliability hinges on supply, quality and price. Currently Ames purchases\nelectricity from Western Area Power Authority (WAPA), the majority of which\nis supplied by large scale hydroelectric dams. WAPA power is delivered to Ames\nover Paci\xef\xac\x81c Gas & Electric (PG&E) power lines. WAPA allots Ames 5.3 percent\nof the daily generating capacity of WAPA hydroelectric dams. This allotment\nvaries day to day as well as seasonally. The price for electricity also varies based\non the volume of water available to WAPA. When WAPA has abundant water,\nAmes\xe2\x80\x99 cost per kilowatt hour falls. When the volume decreases as in a drought,\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s costs may increase. When Ames exceeds WAPA\xe2\x80\x99s electricity allotment,\nWAPA purchases power for Ames through the California Independent Systems\nOperators (CAISO), part of the open market for electricity. Electricity through\nthe open market is generally more expensive than WAPA power.\nAmes uses natural gas to power boilers for heating water and air, and running air\nconditioning and ventilation systems. Natural gas is provided to NASA Ames by\nPG&E via the Defense Energy Support Center. The Ames Facilities Engineering\nBranch has a number of energy-related projects, a few are discussed below.\nFuel Cells - Fuel cells generate \xe2\x80\x9cclean\xe2\x80\x9d electric power through a highly ef\xef\xac\x81cient\nelectrochemical process that all but eliminates air pollutants and drastically reduces\ngreenhouse gases. Fuel cells are currently under development at two sites, one near\nthe Sustainability Base and the other at the 12ft Wind Tunnel Facility. At the Wind\nTunnel, a 12 kW fuel cell from Logan Energy will serve as a backup power source\nto the DCS Data Systems and Emergency Lighting. The fuel cell is part of the\npromotional backup power fuel cell deployment project of the U.S. Department\nof Energy. Site analysis at Ames has been approved and the Department of the\nArmy will be responsible for procurement of the fuel cell, its installation, and \xef\xac\x81ve\nyears of operations\nand\nmaintenance.\nAt the site of\nSustainability\nBase\nN-232, a solid oxide\nfuel cell produced by\nBloom Energy will be\ninstalled generating\nelectric power for use\nthroughout the center.\nFuel Cell near Building. 232\n\nUtility Energy Services Contract - Using PG&E\xe2\x80\x99s Utility Energy Services\nContract program, Ames has initiated a design-build plan to implement a variety\nof energy ef\xef\xac\x81ciency and renewable energy conservation measures including\ninstallation of a 100 kW photovoltaic system, installation of new high-ef\xef\xac\x81ciency\nHeating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) equipment to replace aging\nand energy-inef\xef\xac\x81cient systems, expansion of the energy management control\nsystem, installation of a small fuel cell, and implementation of a center-wide\nretro-commissioning program.\nStreet and Parking Lot Lights - In cooperation with Relume Technologies,\nin 2010, Ames installed prototype LED streetlights around our administration\nbuilding. These streetlights have a life of 10,000 hours and will use 90 percent\nless power than the existing streetlights. Plans are also underway to install LED\nlighting in the parking lot and along the pathways of the East Side. Additionally,\nAmes installed \xef\xac\x81ve SolarOne LED photovoltaic parking lot lights at the\nAutomation Sciences Research building.\nSolar Panels - Two of Ames\xe2\x80\x99 buildings have rooftop photovoltaic solar panels,\nwhich provide over 10 kW of power, and the solar panels at the Sustainabiliy\nBase will provide and additional 90 kW, once complete. The sign at the front gate\nraises awareness of energy use by posting the center\xe2\x80\x99s monthly usage.\nCloud Computing - The Nebula project moves Ames toward the use of \xe2\x80\x98Cloud\nComputing.\xe2\x80\x99 It uses a containerized data center to house servers on the NASA\nAmes campus. These containers are\nthe \xe2\x80\x9cgreenest\xe2\x80\x9d form of data center\ndue to their inherent density. Nebula\nalso makes Cloud Computing more\nef\xef\xac\x81cient by turning physical hardware\noff when not needed. Estimates\nshow Nebula to be 50% more energy\nNebula Data Center\nef\xef\xac\x81cient than traditional data centers.\nMajor accomplishments and awards:\n3 Ames Sustainability Awards:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 N-232 Sustainability Base Energy Ef\xef\xac\x81cient IT\nInfrastructure - Data from a network of sensors\nthat react to changing environmental and usage\nconditions.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Supercomputer expansion which increased\ncomputing power 8-fold, while avoiding the need\nfor 11MW of power.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Facility Monitoring and Control System enabled\nmore than 140K MHh of savings at no cost.\nEnvironmental Sustainability Report 2011 3\n\nWater\nEO 13514 Agency-wide Goals to Improve Water Use Ef\xef\xac\x81ciency and Management:\n1. Reduce potable water consumption intensity by 2 percent annually through \xef\xac\x81scal year 2020, or 26\npercent by the end of \xef\xac\x81scal year 2020, relative to a baseline of the Agency\xe2\x80\x99s water consumption in \xef\xac\x81scal\nyear 2007, by implementing water management strategies including water-ef\xef\xac\x81cient and low-\xef\xac\x82ow \xef\xac\x81xtures\nand ef\xef\xac\x81cient cooling towers.\n2. Reduce agency industrial, landscaping, and agricultural water consumption by 2 percent annually or 20\npercent by the end of \xef\xac\x81scal year 2020 relative to a baseline of the agency\xe2\x80\x99s industrial, landscaping, and\nagricultural water consumption in \xef\xac\x81scal year 2010.\n3. Consistent with State law, identify, promote, and implement water reuse strategies that reduce potable\nwater consumption.\n4. Implement and achieve objectives identi\xef\xac\x81ed in the USEPA storm water management guidance.\n5. Manage existing buildings to reduce water consumption.\n6. Ensure 95% of all new contracts, including non-exempt contract modi\xef\xac\x81cations, require products and\nservices that are water-ef\xef\xac\x81cient.\n\nAmes continues to reduce its use of potable water in the years to come in order\nto meet the requirements of Executive Orders 13423 and 13514 by reducing\nwater use intensity in its processes and using reclaimed water instead of potable\nwater where feasible.\nLarge water uses at Ames include irrigation, cooling towers, interior building\nuse, vehicle and aircraft washing, and food service. Ames has established a\nWater Community of Practice and is undertaking the following initiatives to\nprotect water quality and reduce potable water consumption.\nEast Side Irrigation System - In 2009 a portion of the east side was\nconverted to using reclaimed water from the Sunnyvale Wastewater Treatment\nPlant. Potable water was saved by the use of this reclaimed water for golf\ncourse irrigation, in the amounts of 53 million gallons in FY 2009 and 31\nmillion gallons in FY 2010.\nAmes used 218 million gallons of potable water in FY 2009 and 178 million\ngallons in FY 2010, costing $985,000 and $863,000, respectively. Additional\ndecreases are considered\nanomalous based on\ntemporary\ndecreased\nfacility uses, decreased\naircraft washings, and\nless irrigation during mild\nsummers, and cannot\nnecessarily be counted on\nin the future.\nMoffett Field East Side irrigation\nMajor accomplishments and awards:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\nSuccessful 2010 Water Summit held in\ncoordination with Sustainable Silicon Valley.\n\xe2\x80\xa2\nAwarded a White House Award for East Side\nIrrigation System project.\n\xe2\x80\xa2\nBlue Marble Award given to Dr. Leslie PrufertBebout for her research utilizing algae to produce\ncarbon-neutral renewable energy.\n\xe2\x80\xa2\nDr. Richard Luthy (Stanford University) spoke\nat the 2010 Earth Day Directors Colloquium\ndiscussing California\xe2\x80\x99s urban water challenges.\n\n4 NASA Ames Research Center\n\nGround Water Reuse Project - Signi\xef\xac\x81cant decreases in potable water use\nare anticipated when the Ground Water Reuse project is completed and put\ninto operation, either late 2011 or 2012. This project converts the currently\nmothballed Industrial Wastewater Pretreatment Plant into a reverse osmosis\nplant to produce industrial feed water for Ames\xe2\x80\x99 Arc Jet and Unitary Wind Tunnel\nfacilities. The process will use available treated (for environmental cleanup\npurposes) groundwater sources\nthat discharge to the environment,\nsuch as to Stevens Creek, without\nany reuse. When implemented, this\nnew groundwater reuse facility is\nexpected to save approximately 29\nmillion gallons of potable water\nSteelhead trout in Stevens Creek;\nper year without impacting the\nphoto by Chris Alderete\nsteelhead in Stevens Creek.\nStorm Water Management - In 2010, after the Navy cleaned up the PCB\ncontaminated soils and restored the vegetation and hydrologic \xef\xac\x82ow, NASA\nacquired the Northern Channel (a.k.a. The Moffett Channel) from Cargill. The\nNorthern Channel provides \xef\xac\x82exibility for managing \xef\xac\x82ood water from upstream\nsources, major spills, and over\xef\xac\x82ow from the Bay.\nUtility Energy Service Contract (UESC) - A UESC is currently being\nimplemented at Ames, which includes water saving upgrades, such as low \xef\xac\x82ow\ntoilets, urinals, and faucets.\nEmergency Water Tank - Ames receives water from the San Francisco Public\nUtilities Commission whose sources are the Hetch Hetchy Reservoir in the\nSierra Nevada and a local watershed in Alameda County. A 400,000 gallon\nemergency water tank ihas been installed at Ames for the potable water system.\nNative Landscaping - Each year Ames\xe2\x80\x99 native landscaping saves approximately\n93,000 gallons of water. Conversion of the air\xef\xac\x81eld turf to native plants is being\nstudied. Additionally, Earth\nscientists are comparing\nwater usage and the carbon\nfootprint of conventional\nvs. native landscaping\nto \xef\xac\x81nd additional water\nNative landscaping; photo by Chris Alderete savings.\n\nAir\nEO 13514 Agency-wide Goals for Air Quality:\n1. Pursue opportunities with vendors and contractors to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions\n(e.g., transportation options and supply chain activities).\n2. Develop and implement innovative, Agency-speci\xef\xac\x81c policies and practices to reduce GHG emissions\nfrom commuting during Agency operations.\n3. Decrease use of chemicals directly associated with GHG emissions.\n\nAs an active research center, Ames requires clean air in its operations, yet under\nvarious regulations these operations are permitted to generate air pollution. The\ntable below lists major pollution sources and the control systems.\nAir Pollution\nSource\n\nPollution\nControl System\n\nVehicular traf\xef\xac\x81c\n\nFederal and state emission controls\n\nAircraft operations\n\nAircraft emission controls\n\nBoilers-natural gas combustion\n\nBay Area Air District emission controls\n\nPaint and resin spray booths\n\nFilter/water wash spray, low volatile organic\ncompound coatings\n\nSolvent cleaning & operations\n\nTightly closed tanks & containers, high boiling point (low volatility) solvents\n\nFuel dispensers\n\nVapor recovery systems\n\nThermal Protection Labs Arc Jets\n\n2-stage scrubber: vacuum-holding sphere\nand tower\n\nWind tunnel testing of powered\nmodels\n\nBay Area Air District emission controls, air\ncredits\n\nAmes has one of the most comprehensive air quality monitoring programs in\nthe Federal government. The data is used to make informed decisions on how\nto demolish or retro\xef\xac\x81t older buildings and design and operate new buildings\nto assure a healthy work environment. Additionally, carbon dioxide (CO2) is\nemitted into the atmosphere as a result of Ames\xe2\x80\x99 energy usage. To assure air\nquality, Ames has undertaken several initiatives - some are highlighted here.\nRenewable Energy Purchases - Besides the above requirements, EO 13514\nalso requires renewable energy purchases under the 2005 Energy Policy Act\n(EPAct) to increase carbon-neutral energy use and lower GHG emissions.\nThe Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) - This annual report to the Environmental\nProtection Agency (EPA) tracks pollutants and has thresholds for air, waste, and\nwater releases. Ames is required to report releases and emissions for certain\nchemicals above certain thresholds. Of the 650 TRI listed chemicals and\ncompounds, Ames has 123 TRI chemicals and 21 TRI compounds known to be\nused or present on site. None of these chemicals or compounds used at Ames\nexceeded any activity (manufacturing, processing, or other use) thresholds for\nthe 2010 reporting year.\nFleet Management - The Ames Transportation of\xef\xac\x81ce manages the Motor Pool,\nwhich is a \xef\xac\x82eet of \xef\xac\x82ex-fuel vehicles from the General Services Administration.\nThis \xef\xac\x82eet includes vehicles that can use either\nethanol or gasoline. In addition, compressed\nnatural gas (CNG) vehicles and Global\nElectric Motorcars (GEM) are in use, and\ngreen products are used to maintain them.\nAdditionally, in 2010, The Environmental\nGem Motorcar\n\nManagement Division purchased a hybrid truck for use in handling hazardous\nwaste, and the facilities maintenance contractor converted its \xef\xac\x82eet to hybrid\nutility trucks.\nSynthetic Minor Operating Permit - In June 2011, the Bay Area Air Quality\nDistrict approved the Synthetic Minor Operating Permit under the Federal\nClean Air Act. This saves NASA Ames more than $1,000,000 over the next\ndecade, compared to the higher level CAA Title V permit otherwise required.\nThis permit addresses new requirements which take into account greenhouse\ngas emissions.\nBoilers - Ames is replacing 28 boilers under the UESC contract to improve\nenergy ef\xef\xac\x81ciency. The\nremaining boilers will be\nupgraded, replaced, or\nretired to comply with the\nnew BAAQMD regulations.\nThis project is ongoing and\nwill take several years to\ncomplete.\nAmes Renovated Boiler System\nNOX Scrubber - Ames is upgrading the Arc-Jet NOX scrubber, after 30 years\nof use, to meet new regulations for air emissions.\nOzone Depleting Substances (ODS) - NASA has been managing its stockpile\nof Halon for use in aircraft and space vehicle \xef\xac\x81re-\xef\xac\x81ghting while looking for\nnon-ODS alternatives. Additionally, Ames collects old refrigerators and airconditioning units prior to disposal and drains the refrigerants.\n\nLeft: Halon containing \xef\xac\x81re extinguisher.\nRight: Discarded refrigerators and air conditioners awaiting recycling\nafter ODS removal.\nMajor accomplishments and awards:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Logistics transportation team installed vapor\nrecovery systems on fueling stations - 2011.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Synthetic Minor Operating Permit was submitted\nin June 2011 for approval.\nEnvironmental Sustainability Report 2011 5\n\nClimate Change\nEO 13514 Agency-wide Goal for Climate Change:\n1. Develop an Agency-wide goal for greenhouse gas reduction and obtain White\nHouse, Of\xef\xac\x81ce of Management and Budget, approval.\n2. Develop an Agency-wide Adaptation Strategy.\n\nClimate change is a long-term change in the statistical distribution of weather\npatterns over periods from decades to millions of years.

Report in accordance with Sections 301 and 313 of the Emergency Planning and Community Right-toKnow Act (EPCRA) of 1986.\n\nWaste generated at Ames in FY 2010 was from ongoing research operations and\nconstruction and demolition (C&D) activities. Ames has programs that recycle\nvarious hazardous and non-hazardous solid waste streams, and is doing well\nwith C&D recycling, achieving a 99% recycling rate; well above the required\n50%. However, non-C&D solid waste has a 22% recycling rate. The challenge\nwill be in meeting the 50% recycling rate required by the end of FY 2015.\nHazardous Waste: NASA is subject to the Resources Conservation and\nRecovery Act (RCRA), a cradle-to-grave requirement, and other Federal,\nState, and local hazardous material and waste requirements. In FY 2010, Ames\nshipped 330,595 lbs of hazardous waste offsite for proper disposal or recycling.\nAlmost half (47%) was sent to land\xef\xac\x81ll. 37 percent was recycled or reclaimed.\nThe rest was disposed via incineration (6%), fuel blending (4%), neutralization\n(3%), stabilization (2%), and metals recovery (0.3%).\nMost of the hazardous waste at Ames is from clean up and maintenance\noperations. Contaminated soil accounted for over a third of the hazardous\nwaste shipped. Adding oil and oily water accounts for 60% of hazardous waste\nshipped.

These projects\nare aimed at improving aircraft fuel ef\xef\xac\x81ciency, developing the next generation of\nef\xef\xac\x81cient air traf\xef\xac\x81c control, and creating new technologies and systems engineering\nprocesses to advance the future of carbon-neutral air transportation.\nFuture Air-Traf\xef\xac\x81c-Management Concepts Evaluation Tool (FACET) FACET is an Ames developed \xef\xac\x82exible software tool that provides powerful\nsimulation capabilities and can rapidly generate thousands of aircraft trajectories\nto enable ef\xef\xac\x81cient planning of air traf\xef\xac\x81c \xef\xac\x82ows. It equips service providers with a\nway to explore, develop and evaluate advanced air transportation concepts before\nthey are \xef\xac\x81eld-tested and eventually deployed.\nIn addition to modeling the airspace system for NASA research, FACET has also\ntransitioned into a valuable tool for operational use. FAA traf\xef\xac\x81c \xef\xac\x82ow managers\nand commercial airline dispatchers have used FACET technology for real-time\noperations planning. FACET integrates live air traf\xef\xac\x81c data from FAA radar\nsystems and weather data from the National Weather Service to summarize NAS\nperformance. This information allows system operators to reroute \xef\xac\x82ights around\ncongested airspace and severe weather to maintain safety and minimize delay.\n\nKleenSpeed - KleenSpeed Technologies, Inc.

Coordinating with regional programs for Federal, State, tribal, and\nlocal ecosystem, watershed, and environmental management.\n\nIn addition to efforts highlighted in previous sections, Ames is responsible for\nstewardship of natural resources.\nWildlife Habitat Protection - The saltwater marshes, wetlands, and grasslands\nat Ames are home to several protected species, including the Western burrowing\nowl, gray fox, salt marsh harvest mouse, salt marsh common yellowthroat,\nclapper rail, snowy plover, loggerhead shrike, white-tailed kit, Northern harrier,\ngolden eagle, horned lark, American peregrine falcon, and the Western pond\nturtle. Mitigation measures have been taken to reduce human impact and protect\nthese species. For example, currently 81 acres are protected burrowing owl\nhabitat. The number of owls varies from year to year, but generally 15 to 25\npairs are present during the breeding season. The number of salt marsh harvest\nmice at Ames is unclear since the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services grants few\npermits to survey these animals due to the concern their delicate habitat would\nbe damaged by surveying. Instead, pickleweed sites are cordoned off during\nactivities that could impact the species. A survey of Western pond turtles has\nbeen completed.\n\nUrban Wildlife - Ames also hosts common species such as skunks, gophers, tree\nsquirrels, pigeons, and rats. Ames implements an Integrated Pest Management\nProgram in collaboration with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, California\nDepartment of Fish and Game, and local entities. Ames is working to eliminate\nfood sources such as from open dumpsters, arti\xef\xac\x81cial feeding, and land\xef\xac\x81lls to\navoid these species becoming wildlife pests.\nThe Environmental Management Division developed wildlife awareness\ntraining, and presented it to Center personnel including emergency responders.\nThe training included emergency response procedures for wildlife, such as how\nto handle a distressed animal.\n\nAmes Fire Department collaborated with the Marine Mammal Center\nto rescue a disoriented sea lion.\n\nWestern Burrowing Owl (Left), Gray Fox (middle) and Salt Water\nHarvest Mouse (right), living at Moffett Field.\n\nAmes is a member of Partners-in-Flight, an international partnership sponsored\nby the Federal government to conserve migratory birds in the Western\nHemisphere under several treaties.

Green buildings as well\nas green building materials for building renovations offer cost savings from a\nlife cycle cost perspective.\nCurrently Ames has 127 buildings, with total interior space of more than 3\nmillion square feet. As Ames and its partners and resident agencies renovate\nor implement \xe2\x80\x9crenovation by replacement,\xe2\x80\x9d opportunities to incorporate green\nbuilding design elements will save the Center operating costs. The Engineering\nand Real Property Management and the Environmental Management Divisions\nhave focused on selecting green building materials and equipment for building\nrenovations. Some of the green building projects include \xe2\x80\x98cool roof \xe2\x80\x99 buildings,\nthat use white re\xef\xac\x82ective coating to keep the building temperatures cool. Others\nfeature installing solar panels and have carpets made from recycled bottles.\nAbout 70% of facilities in the NASA Research Park and Eastside/Air\xef\xac\x81eld are\nbeyond their expected life cycle. In the Ames Campus, this proportion is 44%.\nNASA requires all new buildings and renovations to meet the Leadership in\nEnergy and Environmental Design (LEED) Silver standard. In the near future\nAmes is planning several green building construction projects.\nSustainable Community for Education and Research - Ames is partnering\nwith a consortium of local colleges and universities to establish a sustainable\ncommunity for education and research at the NASA Research Park. The\nconsortium signed a land lease with Ames in December 2008 for 75 acres of\nland in the NASA Research Park. Work on the site could begin as early as 2013,\nwith initial occupancy as early as 2015.\nMajor accomplishments and awards:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Began construction on \xe2\x80\x9cGreen Building.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Received Ames Sustainability Award for using\nSMART monitoring systems in the green building\nto optimize heating and ventilation without\ncompromising user comfort.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 U.S. General Services Administration Real\nProperty Award in the Green Innovation category\nfor the Green Buildings\xe2\x80\x99 net-zero energy\nconsumption.\n12 NASA Ames Research Center\n\nAerial view of NASA Ames Research Center Campus, out\ntowards San Francisco Bay.

These facilities carry out research and development work contributing\nto general sustainability efforts. Ames is working to \xe2\x80\x9cgreen\xe2\x80\x9d these facilities since\nthey have substantial energy, water, and other resource requirements.\nNASA Policy Directive 8820.2, Design and Construction of Facilities, commits NASA to the following:\n\xe2\x80\x9cIndustry-best practices of sustainable design, maintainable design, building commissioning, and safety and\nsecurity shall be incorporated, to the maximum extent\npossible, into the planning and execution of facility\nprojects. The use of these practices ensures that facility projects\nare delivered with the most economical life-cycle cost, least\nenvironmental impact, and maximum benefits in occupant\xe2\x80\x99s\nhealth, safety, security and productivity.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nFacilities (cont.)\nAmes Sustainability Base, \xe2\x80\x98Green Building\xe2\x80\x99\nIn 2007, NASA held a \xe2\x80\x9cRenovation by Replacement\xe2\x80\x9d competition, designed to\nreplace antiquated and inef\xef\xac\x81cient buildings with new, energy-ef\xef\xac\x81cient buildings.\nEach of the agency\xe2\x80\x99s ten centers submitted proposals to build a new facility, and\nAmes Research Center was awarded funding.\n\nAmes Sustainability base\nviewed from Bush Circle\n\nAlthough most people associate\nNASA with space, NASA is\nalso committed to advancing\ntechnology and innovations\nthat will help solve the critical\nchallenges that are facing Earth.\nAs NASA Ames Center Director\nPete Worden says, \xe2\x80\x9cThis tiny\nplanet we share is our only home.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nSustainability Base is one of the greenest Federal buildings ever constructed. It is\ndesigned to go beyond \xe2\x80\x98not hurting\xe2\x80\x99 the environment to actually being bene\xef\xac\x81cial\nto nature and humans. Through a combination of innovative design and leadingedge technology, Sustainability Base generates all the power it needs to operate.\nPhotovoltaics (solar Panels), a highly ef\xef\xac\x81cient fuel cell and a small wind turbine\n\nhave been, or are being installed.\nThe building will use 90 percent\nless potable (drinking) water\nthan a traditional building of\ncomparable size.\nThe building and landscaping are\ndesigned \xe2\x80\x98native to place,\xe2\x80\x99 which\nmeans they capitalize on the\nnatural resources of its location\nSustainability Base with native\nand blend seamlessly with their\ngarden landscaping\ncontextual environment and\nculture. The building\xe2\x80\x99s orientation takes advantage of both the sun\xe2\x80\x99s arc across\nMoffett Field and the prevailing Bay Area winds. This means that for all but\napproximately 40 days of the year,\nno arti\xef\xac\x81cial lighting is necessary.\nThe landscape surrounding\nSustainability Base includes plants,\n\xef\xac\x82owers and trees that are native to\nthe area and draught-tolerant.\nThe materials used to build and\nfurnish Sustainability Base were\nlocally procured and include\nrecycled elements. For example, the oak planks that line the second \xef\xac\x82oor lobby\nwere reclaimed from an old NASA wind tunnel.\nBefore and after shots of the\nre\xef\xac\x81nished reclaimed oak planks\n\nSolar panels on the new \xe2\x80\x98green building.\xe2\x80\x99\n\nSustainability Base uses a sophisticated technology to go beyond being a \xe2\x80\x98smart\nbuilding\xe2\x80\x99 and move in to the realm of the intuitive. The building can anticipate\nand react to changes in sunlight, temperature and usage, and over time, it will\nbe able to optimize its performance automatically in response to internal and\nexternal change.\n\nNASA Advanced Supercomputing Facility\nThe NASA Advanced Supercomputing Facility (NAS) was dedicated in March\n1987. It was established to act as a path\xef\xac\x81nder in advanced, large-scale computing\nsystem capabilities through the use of the latest hardware and software\ntechnology and to house NASA Ames\xe2\x80\x99 supercomputers. In 2004, the NAS\nDivision co-developed, with industry partners SGI and Intel, what was initially\nthe fastest supercomputer in the world. Named Columbia, the supercomputer\nis a 10,240-processor SGI Altix supercluster. Columbia remains NASA\xe2\x80\x99s fastest\nsupercomputer, and it is used by scientists and engineers at almost every NASA\ncenter.\nColumbia was intentionally designed using sustainability principles by\ncreating platforms that allow continuous upgrading of systems. The new\nuninterruptible power supply system will use quiet and clean technology.\nIn 2008, the NAS team cut the need for one 450-ton chiller, decreasing\nthe need for 11 megawatts of power. It also increased the computing\npower eight-fold making it the third fastest computer in the world.\nVisit the NAS website at http://www.nas.nasa.gov/\n\nLeft: The Columbia supercomputer.\nRight: Hyperwall displaying Columbia computational data.\n\nEnvironmental Sustainability Report 2011 13\n\nFacilities (cont.)\nArc Jet Laboratory\nThe Ames Arc Jet Laboratory began in the 1950\xe2\x80\x99s, and a permanent facility was\nestablished in 1961. The Arc Jet is key for research in the three major areas\nof Thermal Protection System (TPS) development: selection, validation, and\nquali\xef\xac\x81cation. The Arc Jet data are critical for validating TPS thermal models,\nheat shield designs and repairs, and ultimately, for \xef\xac\x82ight quali\xef\xac\x81cation.\nAn arc jet is a device in which gases are heated and expanded to very high\ntemperatures by a continuous electrical arc between two sets of electrodes at\nsupersonic/hypersonic speeds. The gases pass through a nozzle aimed at a test\nsample in vacuum, and \xef\xac\x82ow over it, producing a reasonable approximation of\nthe surface temperature, pressure, and the gas enthalpy found in a high velocity,\nsupersonic \xef\xac\x82ow of the kind experienced by a vehicle on atmospheric entry. A\nbreakthrough patented design in 1964 by Stein, Sheppard and Watson of Ames\nproduced a high-enthalpy constricted-arc heater, which enabled TPS studies\n\nrequired for development\nof the Mercury and Apollo\nmissions. Currently, Ames is\nexamining opportunities to\nimprove the environmental\nimpact of the Arc Jet by\nutilizing excess steam to\npower other needs at NASA Te\xef\xac\x82on calibration test in the NASA Ames\xe2\x80\x99\nAmes, reducing potable water Arc Jet Interaction Heating Facility.\nuse by recycling water, and\nreducing air emissions by upgrading its boiler system.\nFind out more about the Arc Jet at http://www.nasa.gov/centers/ames/\nresearch/technology-onepagers/arcjetcomplex.html\n\nWind Tunnels\nThe original Ames 40- by 80-Foot Wind Tunnel was constructed in 1944 as\nan experimental facility for researching and testing aircraft, later tests included\n\xef\xac\x81rst-generation jet engines, advanced rotor techniques, and peripheral space use\ntesting. It has the largest wind tunnel test sections in the world, consisting of the\n40- by 80-Foot test section and the 80- by 120-Foot test section.\nThe Unitary Plan Wind Tunnel is the most heavily used NASA wind tunnel,\nand was designed from the start using sustainability principles by centralizing\nand scheduling its power supply. Every major commercial transport and almost\nevery \xef\xac\x81ghter aircraft built in the United States during the last 50 years has\nbeen tested in this tunnel. In addition, models of the Space Shuttle and of the\nMercury, Gemini, and Apollo capsules were tested here. More than 1,000 test\nprograms have been conducted, totaling more than 60,000 hours of operation.\nVisit the wind tunnel website at http://www.windtunnels.arc.nasa.gov/\n\nLeft: National Full-Scale Aerodynamics Complex.\nRight: Unitary Plan Wind Tunnel.\n\nAirfield\nMoffett Federal Air\xef\xac\x81eld (MFA), part of the former Naval Air Station\n(NAS) Moffett Field, is currently operated by NASA Ames. NASA has\ncontinued the tenant program begun by the Navy, hosting several other\norganizations at MFA including the Naval Reserve, the California Air\nNational Guard, and most recently, Airship Ventures which operates a\ncommercial Zeppelin NT airship.\nNAS became a major center for the development and testing of new aviation\nand \xef\xac\x82ight-related technology in the 1940s. After the attack on Pearl Harbor,\nthe military decided it needed aircraft to patrol the Paci\xef\xac\x81c for submarines and\nmines. The Navy responded by restarting the blimp project. As many as 20\nblimps at a time were on duty at the base during the war years, and Moffett\nField had an excellent record of ship and mine detection. During the 1950s\nand 1960s, NAS served as a major naval air transport base. In the 1970s,\nNAS returned to its original mission of long-range reconnaissance and antisubmarine patrols with the arrival of the Navy\xe2\x80\x99s newest anti-submarine aircraft:\nthe P-3 \xe2\x80\x9cOrion.\xe2\x80\x9d By 1973, aircraft based at Moffett Field were responsible for\n14 NASA Ames Research Center\n\npatrolling approximately 93 million square miles of the Paci\xef\xac\x81c Ocean, an area\nstretching from the coast of Alaska to Hawaii. On July 1, 1994, the military base\nwas closed and Ames assumed control of the air\xef\xac\x81eld.\nMFA has two fully instrumented parallel runways, four aircraft maintenance\nhangars, and 472,300 square yards of aircraft parking apron. Hangar 1, located\non the west side of the air\xef\xac\x81eld, was constructed in the 1930\xe2\x80\x99s and has had\nvarious uses. The Navy is currently removing the PCB contaminated siding and\npaint, and NASA is evaluating alternatives for preserving the structure for reuse.\n\nMoffett Federal Air\xef\xac\x81eld with Hangar 1 on the left.\n\nContamination Cleanup & Remediation\nThe purpose of NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Environmental Compliance & Restoration (ECR) Program is to clean up chemicals\nreleased to the environment from past activities. Cleanups are prioritized to ensure that the highest\npriority liabilities are addressed \xef\xac\x81rst in order to New Goals? health & the environment and preserve\nprotect human\nnatural resources for future missions.\n\nNASA Ames includes both the original Ames campus and a portion of the\nformer Naval Air Station Moffett Field. NASA is cleaning up contamination\nfrom past NASA activities and it is subject to site speci\xef\xac\x81c enforcement orders.\nNaval Air Station Moffett Field Cleanup Site - The former Naval Air\nStation Moffett Field has been designated a Superfund site by the U.S.\nEnvironmental Protection Agency (EPA). The U.S. Navy has identi\xef\xac\x81ed\nmultiple sources of contamination at Moffett Field, and the Navy is\nresponsible for the cleanup under a Federal Facilities Agreement with\nthe U.S. EPA, and the State of California. A variety of contaminants are\npresent, including solvents, polychlorinated biphenyls, oils, greases and fuels.\nMEW Study Area - A large area of shallow groundwater contamination has\nmigrated onto Ames from three superfund sites bounded by Middle\xef\xac\x81eld, Ellis\nand Whisman Streets (MEW). These sources of contamination are associated\nwith the prior use of solvents by semiconductor companies no longer located\nin the area. The contamination from these sources has combined with the Navy\nand NASA sources. This contamination is under the jurisdiction of the U.S.\nEPA and the California EPA\xe2\x80\x99s Water Quality Control Board. Cleanup by the\nMEW companies is subject to a consent order from the U.S. EPA. The status of\ncleanup ranges from investigation phase to treatment to clean closure.\n\nof Center development under the NADP. In 2001, NASA prepared an Environmental Issues Management Plan, and compiled a Record of Decision in\n2002, to address these matters, including protection of construction workers,\nthe remediation systems in contaminated areas, and the disposal of contaminated soils and groundwater encountered during construction. All partners are\nrequired to comply with the associated Environmental Issues Management Plan.\nAdditionally, Ames uses a variety of hazardous materials and generates hazardous waste in its operations and research. Typical hazardous materials include\ntoxic gasses, acids, fuels and solvents. NASA Ames has a comprehensive Environmental Management System designed to ensure these materials are handled\nin compliance with Federal, State and local laws.\nOverall, current environmental management programs at Ames Research Center ensure that past contamination is remedied. Ongoing operations prevent or\nminimize pollution, and reduce emissions to the environment by complying\nwith all environmental regulations.\n\nRegional (MEW) Groundwater Contamination\n\nNASA Cleanup Activities - NASA sources of contamination are also present\non the Ames campus, and 13 areas of investigation have been established. The\nsites that overlie the MEW groundwater contamination are under the jurisdiction\nof the U.S. EPA, and those that do not overlie the groundwater contamination\nare under the jurisdiction of the CA EPA\xe2\x80\x99s\nDepartment of Toxic\nSubstances Control.\nThe status of cleanup\nranges from ongoing\ninvestigation to clean\nclosure.\nLeft: Remediation Program Manager prepares\nmany reports to regulatory agencies.\nRight: Through interagency cooperation, the\nHangar 1 time capsule has been preserved.\n\nThese contaminated\nsites introduce a variety of issues that increase the complexity\n\nMajor accomplishments:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The parties have begun vapor intrusion sampling\nof occupied buildings located over the area\ngroundwater contamination for the purpose of\nimplementing U.S. EPA approved remedies.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The Navy has initiated the removal of PCBcontaminated siding from Hangar 1.\n\nTCE concentration in the groundwater aquifer due to contamination from\nRegional (MEW) sources.\nEnvironmental Sustainability Report 2011 15\n\nContamination Cleanup & Remediation (cont.)\nHangar 1\nMoffett Field\xe2\x80\x99s Hangar 1 is a recognizable landmark in the San Francisco Bay\narea and a part of its early aviation history.

The remainder have been placed in storage.\n\nBioremediation\nThe Navy transferred the Hangar to NASA in 1994 after Moffett Field was de- Studies\ncommissioned. Hangar 1 is one of the country\xe2\x80\x99s largest unsupported structures;\nin fact, the \xef\xac\x82oor covers eight acres and can accommodate 10 football \xef\xac\x81elds.\nPlans to utilize Hangar 1 were put on hold in 1997 with the discovery that the\nstructure is releasing toxic chemicals into the sediment in wetlands bordering\nSan Francisco Bay. The chemicals originate in the lead paint and toxic materials, including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB),\nused to coat the hangar.\nAs a result, the Hangar\nwas closed for human use\nas required by the Toxic\nSubstance Control Act.\nNASA remains commitMacon Airship in Hangar 1.\nted to ful\xef\xac\x81lling its Federal\nstewardship responsibilities by pursuing various reuse options. To allow for this\nreuse, remediation is necessary to clean the toxic waste from the site and refurbish the hangar. The U.S. Navy, in coordination with NASA, is currently\nimplementing a Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and\nLiability Act (CERCLA) removal action that includes:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nDemolition or deconstruction and off-site disposal and/or recycling of\nall interior structures;\nRemoval of the Hangar siding and roo\xef\xac\x81ng;\nRemoval of debris to appropriate off-site disposal or recycling facilities;\nApplication of a weather-resistant epoxy coating to the Hangar\xe2\x80\x99s steel\nstructural frame;\nImplementation of historic mitigation measures (including the salvage of\ncertain historical components);\n\nThe Navy\xe2\x80\x99s remediation project will preserve the Hangar\xe2\x80\x99s steel frame for potential restoration of the hangar, while protecting human health and the environment.
