Navajo\nNation Department of Water Resources\nAbstract: The Navajo Nation (NN) is the largest reservation in the US, and faces\nchallenges related to water management during long-term and widespread drought\nepisodes. The Navajo Nation is a federally recognized tribe, which has boundaries within\nArizona, New Mexico, and Utah. The Navajo Nation has a land area of over 70,000\nsquare kilometers. The Navajo Nation Department of Water Resources (NNDWR)\nreports on drought and climatic conditions through the use of regional Standardized\nPrecipitation Index (SPI) values and a network of in-situ rainfall, streamflow, and climate\ndata. However, these data sources lack the spatial detail and consistent measurements\nneeded to provide a coherent understanding of the drought regime within the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s\nregional boundaries. This project, as part of NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Western Water Applications Office\n(WWAO), improves upon the recently developed Drought Severity Assessment Tool\n(DSAT) to ingest satellite-based precipitation data to generate SPI values for specific\nadministrative boundaries within the reservation. The tool aims to: (1) generate SPI\nvalues and summary statistics for regions of interest on various timescales, (2) to\nvisualize SPI values within a web-map application, and (3) produce maps and\ncomparative statistical outputs in the format required for annual drought reporting. The\nco-development of the DSAT with NN partners is integral to increasing the sustained use\nof Earth Observations for water management applications. This tool will provide data to\nsupport the NN in allocation of drought contingency dollars to the regions most adversely\nimpacted by declines in water availability.\n\n'
