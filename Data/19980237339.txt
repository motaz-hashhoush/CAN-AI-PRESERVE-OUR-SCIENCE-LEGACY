The ASTP consists of three major\ntechnology\nareas:\nfocused,\ncore,\nand research\ntechnologies.\n\norbit and in-space transportation.\nThe current focus of the\nadvanced\nreusable\ntechnologies\n(ART) Project is the\ndevelopment\nof those critical technologies\nrequired to\nenable a rocket-based combined-cycle\n(RBCC) engine and\nultimately\nan RBCC-based\nreusable\nlaunch vehicle.\nAdditional effort is also being expended to address those\nassociated technologies that would be required to not only\nsupport\nan RBCC-based\nvehicle but other advanced\nreusable transportation\nsystems as well. This paper will\ndescribe the work that has been performed since the last\nproject status was presented to the 1997 Joint Propulsion\nConference.\'\n\nThe ART project currently\ncovered under NASA Research\n\nmanages the work that is\nAnnouncements\n8-16 and\n\n8-21. The project\'s\nprimary focus over the last 2 years\nhas been on rocket-based\ncombined-cycle\n(RBCC)\ntechnology\ndevelopment\nactivities awarded under NRA\n8-16. The current aerospace and academic organizations\nlisted in Figure\n1 are performing\ntesting and analysis\nsupporting the RBCC propulsion\nactivities. The engine\ncontractors,\nAerojet, Pratt & Whitney, and Rocketdyne\nare currently either testing or preparing to test their RBCC\nengine flowpaths.\nDirect\nconnect\ntesting\nhas been\nperformed at Mach 6 flight conditions in both ramjet and\nscramjet modes and at Mach 8 flight conditions in the\nscramjet mode. Testing has also been performed at sealevel static conditions and at Mach 3.4 ramjet conditions.\n\nCurrently,\nNASA and its industry\npartners\nare\nperforming\nground testing of hydrogen-fueled\nrocketbased combined-cycle\nflowpaths. Successful ramjet and\nscramjet testing at Mach 6 and scramjet testing at Mach 8\nhave been performed.\nCold flow mixing tests have also\nbeen successfully performed as have inlet operability tests.\nAdditional testing of RBCC flowpaths at air augmented\nrocket and rocket only modes is underway.\nAdditional\nwork will be performed on technologies\nthat will support an RBCC-powered\nlaunch vehicle and\nwill be focused in the following\nareas: structures\nand\nmaterials;\navionics\nand operations;\npropulsion\nturbomachinery;\nand thermal protection systems.\n\n\xc2\xa2\n\nAerojet(GenCorp)\n\n\xc2\xa2\n\nAstrox\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Chief Engineer, Advanced Reusable Technologies Project, NASA/\nMSFC, Senior Member AIAA\n\xe2\x80\xa2" Project Manager, Advanced Reusable Technologies Project,\nNASA/MSFC, Member AIAA\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nGASL, Inc.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nGeorgia Institute of Technology\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nPennsylvaniaState University\n\nCopyright \xc2\xa9 1998 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

Funding in\nthis fiscal year has gone to the areas of structures and\nmaterials, TPS and avionics/operations.\nCurrent efforts\nin structures and materials include investigation into the\naluminum\nlithium alloy C458. Funding for avionics/\noperations is currently\nsupporting investigation\ninto an\nadvanced video-based\nrendezvous\nsensor for automatic\nrendezvous and docking technologies and for development\nof super capacitors:\nAlso, NRA8-21\nrecently selected\ntechnology efforts in both airframe and propulsion systems\nfocusing on those technologies that would support the ),ear\n2000 Reusable Launch Vehicle (RLV) decision to establish\nif the RLV program\nis ready to transition\ntechnology effort into a development\nprogram.\n\nfrom\n\na\n\nTest Efforts\nThe engine flowpaths from Acrojet, Rocketdyne, and\nPratt & Whitney\nare either in test or are undergoing\ninstallation\ninto their respective\ntest stands. All direct\nconnect\nand freejet testing is being conducted\nat the\nGeneral Applied\nScience\nLaboratories,\nInc. (GASL)\nfacilities on Long Island, NewYork. Direct connect testing\nof one of the flowpaths at Mach 6 ramjet and scramjet\nconditions\nand Mach 8 scramjet operations\nhas been\ncompleted. Rocket only mode testing and air augmented\nrocket mode testing are underway on another flowpath.\nTrajectory simulation testing is scheduled in Leg 5 of the\nGASL facility in July 1998.\nAn area that has caused a large amount of difficulty\nin the testing efforts is the means of initiating the rocket\n- combustion\nprocess. All three of the engine contractors\nabove were, or are, planning\nto use a combination\nof\noxygen and silane (Sill 4) as the ignition source for the\nthrusters. This follows from past successful use of silane\nin hypersonic\nflowpaths.\nHowever,\ndifficulties\nwere\nimmediately\nencountered\nwhen an 80/20 volumetric\nmixture of hydrogen and Sill 4 was used for rocket ignition.\n\nAfter a lengthy\n\ntest series at MSFC Test Stand 115, one\n\nof the engine RBCC thrusters\ncould be lit with Sill 4\nrepeatedly, but one of the combustion products, silicone\ndioxide, caused major operational difficulties. The silicone\ndioxide formed a hard coating on the lhruster injector face\nas well as on the chamber walls which required lengthy\noperations\nto remove. Due to the unpredictability\nof\nignition\nand the operational\nimpacts of cleaning\nthe\nthrusters after ever)\' test, Sill 4 was dropped as a candidate\nfor ignition for this particular engine.\nA second engine contractor tested their injector at\nMSFC Test Stand 115 and had acceptable ignition using\nSill 4. A thruster was then manufactured\nand Sill 4 ignition\ntesting was performed at the engine contractor location.\nBy manipulating\nsuch variables\nas temperature\nand\nmixture ratio a curve was developed\nthat was used to\ndefine requircd parameters\nto assure combustion\nusing\nSill,. Also, silicone dioxide contamination\nwas not a large\nissue.\nWhen a different\nset of engine thrusters\nwere\ndelivered to GASL for testing, problems were once again\nencountered\nwith Sill 4 ignition. The GASL facility had\nbeen modified to mimic as closely as possible the test\nfacility\nthat was used by the contractor.\nHowever,\nparameters for ignition previously assumed correct were\nrepeatedly used and ignition was not achieved. It has been\npostulated\nthat a minor physical\nvariation in the first\nthruster, alignment of the injector face to the thruster, was\na probable cause for the different results. A decision was\nthen reached that 100-percent\nSill 4 should be used for\nignition purposes.\nPure SiH, has been used for ignition\nfor the rocket tests with success. However, contamination\nremains a problem, as unused\npurged have been obstructed.\nIn both of the above\n\npressure\n\ncases,\n\nports that are not\n\nthe coniractors\n\nhave\n\ndccided to use a combustion wave ignition (CWI) system\nas their method\nfor ignition.\nThis system has b?ei_\npreviously described in detail by Larry Liou of the NASA\nLewis Research Center.2 This system uses a combustion\nchamber in which an oxidizer and fuel, in this case oxygen\nand hydrogen,\nare introduced\nand detonated.\nThe\ndetonation wave is then directed to each of the thrusters\nby means of a small dedicated line which feeds into the\nthrusters, typically from an originalchambe-rpressure\nport.\nThis system has proved to be reliable. Since the system\nuses only hydrogen and oxygen there are no contaminating\ncombustion\nhardware.\nsimple.\n\nby-products\nto contaminate\nthe thruster\nThe system is also fairly inexpensive\nand\n\n2\nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n\n!1_I I-\n\nThere\nhasbeen\nonefailure\nusing CWI system.\nthe\nDuring a sea level static test with rocket operation, a small\nfire was seen during transition from ignition to main stage.\nAfter test termination\nand review of the data and the\nhardware, it was determined that several of the CWI tubes\n\nmixer followed by a diverging duct, the computational\nresults have indicated that thermal choking takes place\nnear the starting point of the diverging section of the duct.\nHowever, the flow field tends to be highly unsteady.\nUltimately this leads to a large amplitude fluctuations\nin\n\nsupplying the combustion\nwave front had failed. Purge\npressures\nin the tubes were below the combustion\npressures, thereby allowing backflow into the tubes, thus\ninducing a failure. Repairs to the system have been made\nand test operations\nhave resumed without any further\nincidents.\n\nthe flow field. Also, a shock wave exists near the exit plane\nof the duct which further accentuates\nthe unsteadiness\nof\nthe flow field. The presence of the downstream shockwave\nis a result of the atmospheric back pressure being too high\nto sustain supersonic flow through the exit.\nOne area of interest throughout the ART project has\nbeen the throats of the small rocket thrusters. The concern\n\nInlet testing has been performed on two of the engine\ncontractor\'s\ninlets. Testing was successfully\ncompleted\nat the Lewis Research Center\'s l xl variable Mach wind\n\nhas been that the throats are so small that there may be\ninadequate cooling to prevent burnout. A separate paper\nis currently being prepared by Kevin Tucker of MSFC to\naddress the analytical methods that were used to address\nthis problem.\nIn summary,\nthere have been different\nmethodologies\napplied to the problem which have yielded\nthroat heat fluxes that were widely different. In response\nto this, PSU has designed, fabricated, and tested a highly\ninstrumented\nRBCC rocket nozzle to accurately measure\nhot gas wall temperatures.\nThe testing of this nozzle has\nbeen completed up to a chamber pressure of 500 psi. Data\nanalysis is currently under way. Results from the PSU\ntesting will be presented at the annual meeting of the\nPolicy Advisory\nBoard of the Propulsion\nEngineering\nResearch Center this fall.\n\ntunnel. Parameters\nthat were varied during the testing\nincluded simulated flight Mach numbers, which varied\nfrom 3.6 to 8.1, throat bleed, cowl positions,\nand\ncontraction\nratio. Testing on one of the engines revealed\nthat throat bleed was a critical parameter. The inlet could\nbe unstarted by simply turning off the bleed flows and\nrestarted by turning them back one. The inlet tests proved\nto be very beneficial\nin the design\nand ultimate\nconfiguration\nof the freejet test engines.

Detailed\nresults of this study have been published in references 3\nand 4. The authors of these references report that the free\nexpansion\nprocess, directly downstream\nof the rocket\nnozzle,\ncan influence\nthe overall\nRBCC\nnozzle\nperformance.\nAlso, the following results were based on\n\ncomposite matrix development,\nadvanced TPS/cryogenic\ninsulation,\ncomposite\ncryotanks\njoining technologies,\ncryotank cylinder shear forming, and advanced aluminum\nlithium alloy C458. In the case of the A1-Li work, initial\nresults have indicated a 5-percent improvement\nin density,\na 10-percent improvement\nin modulus, improved isotropy\nand enhanced ductility in the transverse direction. This\nalloy, C458, is also in the public domain. A "round robin"\nassessment\nis currently\nbeing\nperformed.\nMSFC\nevaluation of C458 have found that the alloy is weldable\nwith fusion or friction stir welding processes and weld\nstrengths and elongation\nare comparable\nto AI-Li 2195\nalloy. To date, C458 plate has exhibited\nexcellent\ncombinations\nof strength,\nfracture toughness,\nwelding\nbehavior, and corrosion resistance.\n\nthe design space of the study: increasing the mixer-ejector\nduct inlet area ratio hinders performance;\nlong mixerejector duct hinders performance;\na large primary rocket\nexit area improves\nperformance\nup to a point; a large\nmixer-ejector exit area ratio improves performance\nup to\na point; high chamber total pressure slightly improves\nperformance;\nand the effect of secondary flow can either\nbe beneficial or detrimental depending on configuration.\n\nFig. 5.

This\nsystem consists of hardware\nand software required for\nautonomous\nrendezvous\nand docking\nwith\nthe\nInternational\nSpace Station or other space platforms. The\ncurrent system uses a video-based\nrendezvous sensor for\nterminal docking operations. This sensor concept is a key\nenabling technology required for rendezvous and docking.\nFunding in fiscal year 1998 will be to investigate the use\nof an active target and/or optical\ntarget with a 2nd\ngeneration\nVideo\nGuidance\nSensor.\nSystems\ndemonstration\nwill at first be done in the MSFC flight\nrobotics lab with planning also begun for a technology\nflight experiment\nof the target and guidance\nsensor.\nFunding\nfor super-capacitor\ndevelopment\nis directed\ntowards development\nof chemical double layer capacitors\nas an advanced power source. The goal of this effort is to\nreduce power source weight by up to 50-percent\nover\nexisting systems.\n\nTesting continues or will be initiated shortly on the\nthree engine contractors\' free jet and direct connect engines\nat GASL, Inc. Due to schedule slips and facility delays, it\nis currently\nbelieved\nthat the test program\nwill be\ncompleted by the end of this calendar year. A combination\nof ART funding and contractor ILIAD efforts will yield\ntest results\nfrom sea-level\nstatic operation,\nto AAR\noperations,\nto ramjet operations, to scram jet operations,\nand finally to all-rocket ascent operations.\nPSU testing\nshould also be completed by the end of the calendar year.\nAlso, this fall the ART project will host another\nworkshop focusing on the RBCC vehicle technologies.\nThe date for this workshop\nhas not been established.\nCycle 2 of NRA 8-21 will begin after receipt of proposals\non October 15, 1998. Cycle 2 is focused on core activities,\nwhere core activities\nare defined as those which will\nprovide for advancements\nin fundamental\ntechnologies\nwhich may enable or enhance a broad range of future\nreusable\nspace transportation\nsystems.\nAdditional\ninformation on NRA 8-21 may be found on the internet at\nhttp://nais.msfc.nasa.gov/home.html.\n\nIn the year 2000, an assessment will be made to decide\nwhether the RLV should progress to the development stage\nor if technology development\nshould continue. In support\nof this activity, NRA 8-21 was issued last February\nsoliciting proposals for RLV-focused technologies.\nLast\nmonth, awards were made both to NASA centers and\nindustry. In the area of airframe systems, awards were\nmade in composite tanks, hot structures, advanced metallic\nTPS, high-temperature\nblanket TPS, and fuel cells. For\npropulsion-focused\ntechnologies,\nawards were made in\nlightweight thrust cells, Carbon matrix composite nozzles,\nhigh-performance\nlightweight\nturbomachinery,\nand\ncomposite\nlines and ducts. All these technology\nefforts\nwill be completed by 2000 to support the RLV decision.\n\nReferences\n1.
