January 12, 1927, having vered, in three months, a\ndistance of 28,000 i (about 17 ) 400 miles), in 260 hours of flight.\nDescription\nThe fusele is made entirely of wood, the framework consisting of a keel, chines and upper longerons of ash. The transverse frames are ash, with the exception of certain end. frames,\nwhich are made of\' grisard." The submerged portion is covered.\netire1y with a double or triple boarding of cuban mahony,\nwhile the part above the water is coered with birch plywood..\nThe deck beams are made of four thicknesses of ash and. spruce\nglued together. The mahogany boarding is protected. by a special\nbituminous dope; the plywood by three coats of 11 Lionoi1\' over a\nspecial filler, likewise with a \'Lionoi1 base \t\n\nThis red filler\n\nis intended. to absorb the ultra-violet rays capable of attacking\nthe fibers of the wood. The three outside layers of "Libnoil\nare white.\nUnder the propeller, the hull is reinforced by sheet metal\nand by a s e riesof small longitudinaf strips, to ke ep the c r ew\n*From "L\'Ae\' ronautique,\xc2\xb0 February, 1927, pp. 37-40.\n\n2\n\nN.AC.A.

They weigh orly\n9\n\nkg (a\'oout 20 lb.) apiece\t\n\nThey were mao.e by the \'tablissements\n\nPoite U and irovided with gauges. All the fuel pipes are aluminum\nwith "A.. connections, cocks, manifold, and fuel--delivery syst em.\nA hand- pump enables the t::ansfe2 of the oil from the 20liter (21-allan) tank in the hL:ll to the 35-liter (9.2-gallon)\ngravity tank in the engine nace:Lle, which tank supplies the engine oil rump.\nThe lines of the hill were designed with special regard to\nits marine qualities. Those qualities have been demonstrated\nnot only on the Madagascar voyage, but also in a very brilliant\nfashion during the tests for the navigability certificate, in a\nsea with 4-5 foot waves.\nThe cell is built on the usual lines adopted for the Liore\'Olivier seaplanes. The box spars are spruce and plywood. The\nribs have plywood webs and spruce flanges. The drag wires are\npiano wires terminated by patented fastenings which have been\nofficially approved. The ties and wing bracing consist of dura.lumin tubes orotectid by three coa\'\t\n\nof ! Lionoil. 0 The flying\n\nwires consist of two pian3 wires heli.d togther by a fairing.\nThe landing wires are strmlined w.res at\' the current type with\nChobert fastenings.\n\nN.A.C.A. Aircraft, Circular No. 39\n\n\t\n\n3\n\nThe win g floats, of 300 liters (10.59 cu.ft.) each, are attached. to the wing by four small duralumin struts and are co y\ny wood over a framework of ash. The standard -crewithb nl\nAvionine p roducts ae used for doping the fabric-covered wings.\nThe tail group c3mpries a main fin and two auxiliary fins,\none above and one below th stabilizer, which s secured by two\nduralumin struts and brace wires.\nThe ailerons, elevator, and rud.1-r have steel frames, autogenously welded and covered with \'ahric.\nThe enine nacelle contains a supporting frame attached by\nfour bolts to the spars of the upper wing and to the struts of\nthe ca\'oane. The nacelle itself is situated between the two\nspars and consists of a steel-tubing framework enclosed in an\naluminliL cowling. It encloses the S.E.V. magnetos, the oil\nnump, the two A.M. fuel pumps, the gravity oil tank, the Lamblin\n34-fin oil radiator and a Bouillon" fire extinguisher. There\nare large inspection ports.\nThe air circulation between the cylinders and around the\ncrank case was very carefully planned. The temperature of the\noil has never exceeded 75\xc2\xb0C. (167\xc2\xb0F.).\nThe flntegraie_Chauvi\xc3\xa8re u propeller vas wood. It manifested\nremarkable wearing qualities, so that it was not found necessary\nto use the spare propeller during the return trip. It had a\ndiameter of 3.1 m (10.17 ft) with a pitch of 1.95 m (6.4 ft.).\nMade of beech wood cut and sawed b y the firm itself, it is coy-\n\nN.A.C.A. Aircraft Circular No. 39 \t\n\n4\n\nered with copoer over 90 cm (2.95 ft.) of each blade. The p ropeller used on the outward trip was lacquered in the factory\nwith the p roducts of the "Socie\'te des laques indochinoises;\nthe one used on the return trip was protected with UIsolmail.IT\nChauvire, when he deiivoied these propellers, did not know\nthey were to be used on a long voyage.\nThe engine group comprised, a 420 HP.

The same enine covered the whole 30,000 k (186,411 miles). The subsequent official examination at Paris showed that the 270 hours of\nflight, in spite of the greatly differing fuels and. lubricants\nused, had not entailed any great wear. The cell was intact and\nthe fabric as taut as at the start. The hull, whichhad struck\n\n5\n\nN.A.C.A.

The only upkeep during the triD\nconsisted of a pijlications of ordinary boat paint, heavy but sure.\nIt was in very good condition, ihich \xe2\x80\xa2is especially remarkable,\nconsidering that there was only one opportunity to raise it out\nof the water for insoection.\nThe condition of the duralurnin parts was perfect in spite\nof its long sojourn in brackish water. The steel fittings, on\nthe contrary, although protected by baked enamel., were quite\nseriously c1amaced.\nCharacteristics\nLength\t\n\n12.5 m\n\n.\n\n41.01 ft.\n\n16.0\n\nHeight\n\n13.45\n\n64.0 7j2\n\nWing area\nEngine, Gnome-Rhono\t\n\n.\t 52.49\n\n4.1\n\n3pan\n\nJuniter\n\n688.89 sq.ft.\n\n9 Ab, 420 HP.\nkg\n\n3791.95 lb.\n\nWeight empty\n\n1720\n\nTotal normal weight\n\n3150\n\n6944.55\n\nActual weight on starting\ntrip (49c\'oeing useful lood) 3350\n\n7385.48\n\nWing lording\nPower\t\n\nH\n\nPower p er m2\n\n52\n\nkg/m2\n\n10.65 Ib./sq.ft.\n\n8\n\nkg/HP\n\n17.40 l\'o./HP.\n\n6.5 HP/m2\n\nTranslation by Dwight M. iner,\nNational Advisory Committee for Aeronautics.\n\n0.6\n\nRP./sq.ft.\n\nT.A.C.A.
