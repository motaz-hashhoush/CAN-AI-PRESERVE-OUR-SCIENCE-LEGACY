Broad agreement in seasonal flow patterns exists between these data sets during the year 2015. Both observe the dramatic reversal from wintertime trade winds (November-April) to westerly flow associated with the summer monsoon (May-October). These seasonal changes have strong but not equivalent effects on mean wind divergence patterns in both data sets. Specifically near the Philippines, the data sets agree on several aspects of the seasonal mean and diurnal cycle of near-surface vector winds and divergence. In particular, RapidScat and CCMP agree that daytime onshore and nocturnal offshore flow patterns affect the diurnal cycle of winds up to ~200 km west of Luzon, Philippines. Observed disagreements over the diurnal cycle are explainable by measurement uncertainty, as well as shortcomings in both data sets.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"volume": "122", "submissionId": 20170011357, "issue": "18", "issn": "2169-897X", "publisher": "American Geophysical Union (AGU)", "eissn": "2169-8996", "id": "4bb6120044d14d77b91bc289a7a60513", "publicationName": "Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres", "publicationDate": "2017-09-10T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20170011357.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20170011357/downloads/20170011357.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20170011357/downloads/20170011357.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20170011357/downloads/20170011357.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
