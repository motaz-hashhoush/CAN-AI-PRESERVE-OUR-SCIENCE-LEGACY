M. Swain, professor o f geology i n t h e University\'s I n s t i t u t e of\nTechnology, reported t h e presence o f sugars (glucose, galactose, and\narabinose) and s e v e r a l unknown carbohydrate-like components i n rocks\nfound i n Minnesota, Ontario, and the Northwest T e r r i t o r i e s .\n\nsource o f t h e carbohydrates was probably microscopic p l a n t s .\n\nThe o r i g i n a l\nSwain\n\npresented a paper on t h e study a t the Third I n t e r n a t i o n a l Meeting on\nOrganic Geochemistry, i n London i n September.\n\nCo-authors o f t h e paper\n\nwere Mrs. Judy G.
