Resilience-based design, on the other hand, seeks to embody generic hazard-mitigating properties in the system to mitigate unknown hazards, often by modelling the system's response to potential hazardous events. This work adapts this approach to the traditional risk-based design process to synthetically generate hazardous modes, by representing them as a unique combination of internal component health-states which can then be injected and simulated in a model of the system failure dynamics. The design process may then reduce the risk of unknown internal hazards by iteratively mitigating the effects of these modes. The performance of this approach is evaluated in a model of an autonomous rover, where cluster analysis shows that elaborating the space of synthetic faults in the drive system using this approach uncovers a wider range of possible hazardous trajectories and failure consequences within each trajectory. However, this increase in hazard information comes at a high computational expense, highlighting the need for advanced, efficient methods to search and sample the hazard space.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "cui": {"isCui": false}, "meetings": [{"country": "US", "submissionId": 20220008332, "endDate": "2022-08-17T07:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"organizationId": "3fad871ba54b5f62941f0831689c0f5b", "meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Society of Mechanical Engineers", "location": "New York, New York, United States"}}, "meetingId": "2c9dc33defd54791b70ef2fb838d54e7", "id": "350ab93f701d402c9d09559f6ac925d0"}], "name": "ASME 2022 International Design Engineering Technical Conferences & Computers and Information in Engineering Conference", "location": "St. Louis, MO", "id": "2c9dc33defd54791b70ef2fb838d54e7", "url": "https://event.asme.org/IDETC-CIE", "startDate": "2022-08-14T07:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "Hulse_IDETC_Presentation_DETC2022-90072.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20220008332/downloads/Hulse_IDETC_Presentation_DETC2022-90072.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20220008332/downloads/Hulse_IDETC_Presentation_DETC2022-90072.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20220008332/downloads/Hulse_IDETC_Presentation_DETC2022-90072.pdf.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
