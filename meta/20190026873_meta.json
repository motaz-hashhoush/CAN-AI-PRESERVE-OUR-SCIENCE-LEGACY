The thermal performance of the microcooler was measured in vacuum for heat reject temperatures between 150 and 300 K. The cooler was driven with Thales XPCDE4865 drive electronics for input powers ranging from 4 to 20 W and drive frequency between 84 and 98 Hz. The optimal drive frequency was dependent on both input power and heat reject temperature. In addition, the exported forces and torques of the cooler were measured with the cooler driven by Thales CDE7232 drive electronics for input powers ranging from 4 to 20 W and drive frequency between 88 and 96 Hz. The exported forces were dependent on both input power and drive frequency. Moreover, the automatic vibration reduction function of the drive electronics was able to decrease the force in the compressor axis to below 10 mN 0-peak. Finally, the DC and AC magnetic fields around the cooler were measured at various locations.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20190026873, "endDate": "2016-06-23T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "CryoCooler.org", "location": "San Diego, CA, USA"}}, "meetingId": "4d8fd761bed843668c322e615ccac659", "id": "db23e7157ed34c2797b9a77246054428"}], "name": "International Cryocooler Conference (ICC19)", "location": "San Diego, CA", "id": "4d8fd761bed843668c322e615ccac659", "startDate": "2016-06-20T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20190026873, "id": "24b3b65ca4354511ba54dea209c125e1", "publicationDate": "2016-06-20T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
