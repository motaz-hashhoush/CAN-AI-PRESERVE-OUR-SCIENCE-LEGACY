This folder describes in detail\nthe satellite,\nthe camera,\nthe display,\nthe picture information, and\nthe beneficial use of the satellite.\nThe camera experiment on ATS-III was proposed and\nconceived by investigators at The University of Wisconsin.\nSanta Barbara Research Center developed the flight\nmodel camera. The photographic animation of "Weather\nin Motion" was developed by the Walter A. Bohan Company, Park Ridge, Illinois. The entire experiment and\ndisplay has been supported by the Earth Observations\nand ATS Programs of the National Aeronautics and\nSpace Administration, Washington, D.C.\n\nI\n\nNATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION\nEarth Observations Program. Washington, D.C. 20546\nWEATHER IN MOTION\n\xe2\x80\xa2\nTo observe a most striking display of weather in motion on a typical day,\nhold the color picture between the index finger and thumb of each hand along the\nsides and midway down from the top of the picture. In the display, Africa is the\nbright orange area in the upper right, the United States is faintly visible in the\nupper left, the Greenland ice cap appears in the upper center, and South America\nstands out prominently in the lower central area. Tilt the top of the picture slowly\ntowards you and then away through a small arc (about 20\xc2\xb0). Each time the top\nmoves toward you, cloud motions over the entire picture area are authentic and,\nalternatively, are reversed when the top of the picture is tilted away.\nNote the spectacular spiral cloud band off the northwest coast of Africa.\nThe cloud system is associated with a storm center (center of the spiral cloud bands)\nand the counterclockwise rotation of the clouds indicates that it is a cyclonic\ndisturbance. The display also presents many other weather phenomena as revealed\nby cloud type, distribution, pattern, and evolution.\nThe display is a composite of 9 individual pictures taken at approximately\n60 minute intervals by the NASA Multicolor Spin-Scan Cloud Camera on the\nApplications Technology Satellite, ATS - III. The total time interval presented in\nthe display is about an 8-hour period. Thus, from weather satellite pictures taken\nat frequent intervals clouds and cloud motions can reveal useful information on\nweather systems on a global scale.\nThe weather in motion display was conceived and developed under a NASA\nXOGRAPH\xc2\xae\nsponsored contract by Walter A. Bohan.\nPrinted In U.S.A.\n\nWeather in Motion\nSpace technology for the direct benefit of man\nin his everyday life has been part of NASA\'s\nmission ever since the agency was created\n\nin 1958.\nThe world\'s first meteorological satellite,\nTIROS-1, was placed in orbit April 1, 1960, and\nimmediately showed the importance of cloud\ncover photos from space to weather\nforecasting. It was followed by more TIROS\nspacecraft as well as the more advanced\nNimbus satellites to continue sensor\nexperimentation for a National Operational\nMeteorological System.\nEarly in 1966, the first operational\nmeteorological satellite was placed in orbit\nfor the Weather Bureau bringing mankind a\nstep closer to the time when accurate long\nrange weather forecasts, based on advanced\noperational satellite-computer technology, will\nbe routine. This goal is expected to be\nattained in the 1970\'s.\nIn late 1966, the ATS-1 spacecraft carrying a\ncloud cover camera was launched into\ngeo-stationary orbit. Thus, for the first time,\nman had the opportunity to observe the\natmosphere below on a continuous basis. Such\nobservations have proven to be extremely\nimportant to the study of severe storms, their\nformation, and dissipation, through time lapse\nphotography. The cover display is but one\nexample of such photography. The ATS\nexperimental program has demonstrated the\nusefulness of such techniques and serves as a\nstepping stone to the operational deployment\nof a similar system now being developed by\nFor sale by the Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office\nWashington, D.C. 20402 - Price 50 cents\n\nNASA for the Environmental Science Services\nAdministration.\n\nThe Satellite\nThe ATS-III satellite was launched from Cape Kennedy,\nFlorida on November 5, 1967 and is orbiting the earth\nat an altitude of 22,300 miles above the equator. At this\naltitude, the spacecraft requires precisely 24 hours to\ncomplete one revolution\xe2\x80\x94as does the earth\xe2\x80\x94thus, the\nsatellite is stationary above a single location on the\nequator. The spacecraft has been over South America\nduring much of its lifetime.\nThe entire satellite spins at 100 rpm\xe2\x80\x94much like a\ngyroscope\xe2\x80\x94so that it does not tumble in space. This\nrotation is extremely precise, as if the satellite were on\nperfect bearings. The spin axis of the satellite is very\nnearly parallel to the earth\'s axis of rotation.\nMore than 24,000 solar cells cover the outside of the\ndrum shaped spacecraft and provide 175 watts of\nelectrical power for the various experiments and for\nradio communication with the earth.\nATS-III Spacecraft\nATS-III carried eleven experiments into orbit; these\nconcern communication, navigation, and meteorology.\nThe Multicolor Spin-Scan Cloud Camera, discussed in\nthis folder, is one of the experiments.\n\nThe Camera\nThe "camera" is really a telescope which scans across\nthe earth from west to east with each rotation of the\nsatellite. A rectangular picture is produced by tilting\nthe camera a small amount so that each new scan line\nis obtained adjacent to the previous line. The complete\npicture is made up of 2400 scan lines which are acquired\nin 24 minutes, because the rotation rate of the satellite\nis 100 revolutions per minute.\n\nThe extremely uniform rotation of the satellite in space\nallows the "camera" to obtain high precision pictures\nof the earth. Although the satellite is 22,300 miles above\nthe earth, the camera can be used to measure the distance\nbetween land features to within a few miles.\n\nAt the focus of the camera are 3 tiny pinhole aperatures\nwhich allow the formation of separate blue, green, and\nred images. Color photos are generated at the ground\nstation by combining these three-color images.\n\nThe Display\nThe display is a composite of 9 individual pictures taken\non November 18, 1967 at approximately 60 minute\nintervals by the NASA Multicolor Spin-Scan Cloud\nCamera on the Applications Technology Satellite, ATSIII. The total time interval presented in the display is\nabout an 8-hour period.\n\nThis photograph which provides the sensation of threedimensional viewing is called a panoramic parallax\nstereogram. A horizontal screen is used to alternately\nplace lines of the nine individual pictures on the final\nimage. A lenticular screen is placed over the final print\nso that parallax allows viewing of alternate images, as the\npicture is tilted back and forth.\n\nThe Picture Information\nEarth Shadow\nThe South Polar region has continuous daylight at this\ntime (November 18), but the North Polar region receives\nmuch less sunlight and the extreme northern region is\ncontinuously shaded from the sun\'s rays.\n\nCloud Formation\nThunderstorms which usually form during the daytime\ncan be seen forming over the Andes Mountains of South\nAmerica and over the extensive Amazon Basin.\n\nCloud Decay\nFog along the coast of Chile, associated with cold Pacific\nOcean water, disappears during the day. Similarly, fog\nand low stratus clouds along the African coasts of Liberia,\nIvory Coast and Ghana dissipate during the daytime\nbecause of intense warming of air in the tropics. High\nclouds disappear over the equatorial Atlantic because of\nthe descending and warming motion of the air near the\nequator.\n\nCloud Motion\nStorm clouds move with circular motion in mid-latitudes\nof both hemispheres. An active storm can be seen in the\nnorthwest portion of the picture over New York State\nand a dissipating storm can be seen in the northeast portion of the picture just off the coast of Spain. Note that\nthese storms rotate in opposite directions to the storm\nnear the southern tip of Chile and to the young storm\nsouth of the bulge of Brazil. Meteorologist are learning\nfrom these time series pictures that clouds are tied to\nthese large scale motions of the atmosphere.\n\nThe low, cumuliform clouds which move westward in\nthe tropics are drifting with the easterly "trade winds."\nSome high cirrus clouds are above the "trade wind"\nregion and are carried north-eastward in "jet streams"\nover the coast of West Africa. Large quantities of heat\nand moisture are carried poleward from the tropics by\nthese "jet streams."\n\nSun Glitter\nThe bright area which approaches the coast of Brazil is\ncaused by mirror like reflections of the sun\'s image from\nthe ocean surface. The size of the area can be used to\nmeasure the wind speed over the ocean surface.\n\nThe Benefits\nSevere Storm Detection\nThe use of earth synchronous satellites gives meteorologist a valuable capability for pinpointing and tracking\nboth hurricanes and severe storms which form tornadoes.\nA dramatic illustration of this capability is shown by the\ncloud structure over Kentucky and Tennessee. These\ncellular clouds are the actual blow-off anvil tops of severe\nthunderstorms which generated many tornadoes in those\ntwo States at that time. Thus, pictures such as this give\nmeteorologist a valuable tool for "nowcasting" as well as\nforecasting.\n\nRemote Sensing of Atmospheric Winds\nThe motion of the clouds is clearly visible by tilting the\npicture to obtain a time sequence of the pictures. By\nusing display techniques with greater resolution it is\npossible to measure cloud displacements with sufficient\nprecision to infer atmospheric winds from the displacements. One series of pictures, such as these, can provide\nwinds over 1/3 of the earths surface\xe2\x80\x94which is a fantastic\nincrease over the present capability of determining winds\nby balloon.\n\nATS-III photo of cloud systems over the United States\n\nGlobal Measurements\nWith four synchronous satellites properly spaced around\nthe earth, it is possible to monitor nearly all of the\nearth\'s cloud cover all of the time. Only small areas in\nthe polar regions are not in view of the satellites. This\nunique observing capability will be implemented in the\nmid-1970\'s to serve as an important component of an\ninternational program to make detailed, global observations of the atmosphere.\n\nU.
