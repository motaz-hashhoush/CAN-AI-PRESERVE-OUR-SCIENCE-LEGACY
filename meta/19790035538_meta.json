The mathematical basis and acceleration characteristics are shown. Performance capability using present day Ion Drive technology is evaluated in terms of stay time at the pole and imaging resolution as a function of viewing distance. The analysis shows that a Polesitter spacecraft can be maintained without difficulty for one or two years at several lunar distances from the earth, admitting large resolution visual imagery and some less useful measurements in the infra-red regime. Microwave measurements are not practical using today's technology. Sensitivity calculations show that substantial improvement in performance capability must await major advances in available technology.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"submissionId": 19790035538, "endDate": "1979-01-17T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Institute of Aeronautics"}}, "meetingId": "80f93b50c8444651bb9349a2bbf6a5e5", "id": "1a39a449f1cb4caf9f0d3c06fc26e597"}, {"meta": {"organization": {"name": "Astronautics"}}, "meetingId": "80f93b50c8444651bb9349a2bbf6a5e5", "id": "a081a6f3bddf430e92a69115a89c0847"}], "name": "American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Aerospace Sciences Meeting", "location": "New Orleans, LA", "id": "80f93b50c8444651bb9349a2bbf6a5e5", "startDate": "1979-01-15T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 19790035538, "id": "0b02fd55f07c443aac3eaef35b5dd5f9", "publicationDate": "1979-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
