Interannual variability is highly volatile and seasonal forecasting has little to no skill, making water management particularly challenging. Over 1902\u20132020, Sierra Nevada cool\u2010season precipitation totals exhibited significant 2.2\u2010 and 13\u201315\u2010year cycles, accounting for approximately 40% of total variability and perhaps signifying potential as seasonal forecasting tools. However, the underlying climate dynamics are not well understood and it is unclear whether these cycles are stable over the long\u2010term. We use tree rings to reconstruct Sierra Nevada cool\u2010season precipitation back to 1400. The reconstruction is skillful, accounting for 55\u201374% of observed variability and capturing the 20th\u2010century 2.2\u2010 and 13\u201315\u2010year cycles. Prior to 1900, the reconstruction indicates no other century\u2010long periods of significant spectral power in the 2.2\u2010 or 13\u201315\u2010year bands. The reconstruction does indicate significant cyclicity over other extended periods of several decades or longer, however, with dominant periodicities in the ranges of 2.1\u20132.7 and 3.5\u20138 years. The late 1700s through 1800s exhibited the highest\u2010amplitude cycles in the reconstruction, with periodicities of 2.4 and 5.7\u20137.4 years. The reconstruction should serve to caution against extrapolating the observed 2.2\u2010 and 13\u201315\u2010year cycles to guide future expectations. On the other hand, observations and the reconstruction suggest that interannual variability of Sierra Nevada cool\u2010season precipitation is not a purely white noise process and research should aim to diagnose the dynamical drivers of extended periods of cyclicity in this critical natural resource.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 20210000444, "issn": "0043-1397", "publisher": "Wiley / American Geophysical Union", "eissn": "1944-7973", "id": "9890ffd7fd5441f2b1b9213810db10c5", "publicationName": "Water Resources Research", "publicationDate": "2020-12-08T05:00:00.0000000+00:00", "doi": "10.1029/2020WR028599"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "BCookWaterResResTreeSuppAccepted.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20210000444/downloads/BCookWaterResResTreeSuppAccepted.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20210000444/downloads/BCookWaterResResTreeSuppAccepted.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20210000444/downloads/BCookWaterResResTreeSuppAccepted.pdf.txt"}}, {"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "BCookWaterResResTreeAccepted.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20210000444/downloads/BCookWaterResResTreeAccepted.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20210000444/downloads/BCookWaterResResTreeAccepted.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20210000444/downloads/BCookWaterResResTreeAccepted.pdf.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
