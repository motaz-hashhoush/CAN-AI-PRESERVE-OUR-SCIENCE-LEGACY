b"Engine Lubricant\n\nNASA COATING\nTECHNOLOGY IS\n\nI\n\nINCORPORATED IN\nA NOVEL\nAUTOMOTIVE ENGINE\n\n- I\n\nurray United Developmer\nCorporation (MUDCO),\nLanding, New Jersey is a\nresearch and development firm\nfounded by well-known inventor Jerome L. Murray, holder of\nmore than 50 patents, among\nthem the rotating TV antenna,\nelectric carving knife, high\nspeed dental drill and peristaltic\nheart pump. MUDCO's principal current project is a novel\nRotorcam engine designed principally for automobile use but\nalso applicable to light aircraft,\nboats, stationary engines or lawn\nmowers. Above, Murray (striped\n1\ntie) and chief engineer A Richey\nlook over the specifications for a\ntest run of the engine, which is\nshown in the foreground.\n\nM\n\nThe Rotorcam has no crankshaft, flywheel, distributor, or\nwater pump and it can run on\nvirtually any kind of fuel. It is\na rotary engine, only 10 inches\nlong, with four cylinders radiating outward from a central axle\nlike spokes on a wheel; in\noperation, the\ncylinders rotate\npast stationary\nfuel and exhaust\nports and a\nsingle, centrally\nlocated spark\nplug. MUDCO\nofficials say that\na production\nversion of the\nengine will be\nlighter, more\n\nIndustrial Productivity and Manufacturing Technology\n\nL\n\ncompact and cheaper to manufacture than current auto engine\ntypes and will feature cleaner\nexhaust emissions. Prototype\nengines have been extensively\ntested and MUDCO hopes to\neffect a licensing arrangement\nwith a manufacturer in the\nnear future.\nNASA technology is incorporated in the Rotorcam engine\nin the form of a valve coating.\nMUDCO chief engineer Richey\nwas aware of Lewis Research\nCenter's development of a family of materials thaf provide\nengine lubrication over a wide\ntemperature range. MUDCO\nselected the plasma-sprayed\nPS 212 as a coating for the\nRotorcam's valves to eliminate\nthe need for a liquid lubricant.\nPS 212 contains 70 percent\nchromium carbide, 1 5 percent\nsilver and 15 percent barium\nfluoride/calcium fluoride; the\ncarbide acts as a wear resistant\nmatrix and the silver and fluorides serve as low and high\ntemperature lubricants, respectively. In 1992, MUDCO tested\nthe Rotorcam with PS 212 coated valves and found the material to be the answer to their\nrequirement. Below is a\nPS212-coated port seal of the\nRotocam engine.\n\n"
