The causes for this restriction are briefly reviewed. At the time when space probes make major advances possible, at incomparably higher levels of expenditure, the need arises to re-examine the limiting factors of earth-based planetary resolution. In addition to familiar refinements (of which seven are listed) carried somewhat further, a specific approach, yet insufficiently developed, is the study of the atmospheric boundary layer over the observatory site and the use of an appropriately elevated station.", "title": "High resolution planetary observation", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-07T19:30:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19740006405, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Kuiper, G.
