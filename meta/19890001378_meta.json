The stars have v sin i's ranging from 6 to 46 km/sec. Such large velocities are not explained by scenarios of main sequence to giant star evolution. Fluxes of the ultraviolet emission lines of these stars are substantially less than those of FK Comae. Many of these giants have a moderate or strong lithium line strongly suggesting that these stars recently evolved from rapidly rotating A or early F stars as is suggested by their space motions. Thus, they are not spun down FK Com stars. The characteristics of these stars are such that they may be confused with pre-main sequence stars. The primary difference may be that the post main sequence stars have strong H alpha absorption lines while the pre-main sequence stars appear to have a weak H alpha absorption line or possibly H alpha in emission above the continuum.", "title": "Lithium and chromospherically active single giants", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-05T19:01:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19890001378, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Fekel, Francis C."}, "organization": {"name": "Vanderbilt Univ.", "location": "Nashville, TN, United States"}}, "id": "f15f005d3bbd495bbfc2cbdfd3d43bbb"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19890001378, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19890001378, "id": "dc9d2a3c72194974becd41776a49fc6c", "publicationName": "ESA, A Decade of UV Astronomy with the IUE Satellite, Volume 1", "publicationDate": "1988-06-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19890001378.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19890001378/downloads/19890001378.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19890001378/downloads/19890001378.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19890001378/downloads/19890001378.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
