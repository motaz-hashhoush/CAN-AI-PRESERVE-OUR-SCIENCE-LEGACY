The measurements were compared to simplified Neuber notch analysis predictions of notch root stress and strain. The actual strains incurred at the root of a discontinuity in cyclically loaded test samples subjected to inelastic deformation at high temperature where creep deformations readily occur were determined. The steady state cyclic, stress-strain response at the root of the discontinuity was analyzed. Flat, double notched uniaxially loaded fatigue specimens manufactured from the nickel base, superalloy Inconel 718 were used. The ISDG was used to obtain cycle by cycle recordings of notch root strain during continuous and hold time cycling at 649 C. Comparisons to Neuber and finite element model analyses were made. The results obtained provide a benchmark data set in high technology design where notch fatigue life is the predominant component service life limitation.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19830004181, "id": "0b3968debd8d41e7bd88d1a481084b28", "publicationDate": "1982-10-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19830004181.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19830004181/downloads/19830004181.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19830004181/downloads/19830004181.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19830004181/downloads/19830004181.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
