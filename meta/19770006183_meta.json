The results of these tasks show that the basic signal structure design is sound and that the goals can be met. Constraints placed on return link hardware by this structure allow reasonable specifications to be written so that no extreme technical risk areas in equipment design are foreseen. A third channel can be added to the PM mode without seriously degrading the other services. The feasibility of using only a PM mode was shown to exist, however, this will require use of some digital TV transmission techniques. Each task and its results are summarized.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19770006183, "id": "357cf6174ed847b78a7ab5718b73a8e2", "publicationDate": "1976-11-30T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19770006183.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19770006183/downloads/19770006183.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19770006183/downloads/19770006183.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19770006183/downloads/19770006183.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
