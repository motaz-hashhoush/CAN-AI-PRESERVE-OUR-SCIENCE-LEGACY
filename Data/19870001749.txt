Levine\nAeronautics\nand Space Administration\nLewis Research Center\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe hot section of an aircraft gas-turbine engine presents a severe chemical environment\ndue to the presence of available oxygen and nitrogen under\nkinetically favorable conditions as well as due to the occasional presence of\npotentially more aggressive air-borne and fuel-borne impurities which can be\ncollected as corrosive salt deposits.\nThus, (as shown in fig. l) one must\nconsider such phenomena as high-temperature\noxidation, corrosion, and erosion\nof base metals and their protective coatings as well as the materials\' creep\nand fatigue responses to imposed mechanical and thermal loads.\nThe consequences of unexpected severe environmental attack are illustrated\nin figure\n2. However, even less dramatic environmental attack degrades system efficiency, reduces life, and ultimately costs us money.\nThe chemical response and the mechanical response of hot-section materials\nare not isolated phenomena.\nThe influence of the chemical response on the\nmechanical\nresponse (and vice versa) must be understood to adequately design a\ncomponent.\nThus, the goal of the surface protection subproject is to develop\nan integrated, environmental\nattack, life-prediction methodology\nfor metaland\nceramic-coated\nhot-section components.\nThis scheme will consider environmental\nattack life prediction as well as the effects of environment and coatings on\nmechanical response.\nAs illustrated in figure 3, thermal and mechanical\nloads\nare inputs, and the analysis methods result from studies of material behavior\nin laboratory and engine tests.\nThe surface protection subproject consists of\nthree major thrusts:\n(1)\n\nAirfoil\n\ndeposition\n\nmodel\n\n(2)\n(3)\n\nMetallic coating life prediction\nThermal barrier coating (TBC) life prediction\n\nThe time frame for each of these thrusts and the expected outputs are displayed\nin figure 4. The airfoil deposition model will predict the location and potential severity of hot-corrosion\nattack of turbine airfoils by late 1987.\nThe metallic coating life prediction effort will produce models to predict\nmetallic coating life as well as, in conjunction with the fatigue and fracture\nsubproject,\nthe effects of the environment and coatings on mechanical response.\nFinally, the thermal barrier coating (TBC) life-prediction\nthrust, which has\ngrown to maturity during the past year, will yield life-prediction\ntools to\npermit use of TBC in the performance\nimprovement mode.\nSuch aggressive TBC\nuse places the burden for component integrity on the life of the coating, and\ntherefore progress of this technology is life-prediction-capability\ncritical.\nFigure 5 gives further details of each thrust insofar as specific element\nschedules and whether they are being conducted in-house (I), via grant (G), or\nvia contract (C).\n\n21\n\nAIRFOIL\n\nDEPOSITION\n\nMODEL\n\nThe direction of the airfoil deposition model effort\nThe goal, approach, and status for the airfoil deposition\nfollows:\n\nis shown in figure 6.\nmodel thrust are as\n\nGoal:\nTo develop and verify a model\nand location on turbine airfoils.\n\ndeposition\n\nto predict\n\ncorrodant\n\nquantity\n\nApproach:\nAirfoil model development\nvia grant with Dan Rosner of Yale\nModel verification via in-house research with support from S.

Gokoglu of Analex Corporation at\nLewis.\nIn parallel with the model development, in-house burner rig facilities\nare being modernized in support of this and other HOST thrusts.\nTo date, the work of Rosner, Gokoglu, and coworkers has been documented\nby numerous publications in the open literature (refer to their workshop papers\nfor references).\nThese papers describe the initial airfoil deposition model\nand its verification.\nThe goal, approach,\nfollows:\n\nand status\n\nof the rig and engine\n\ncorrelation\n\nis as\n\nGoal:\nProvide a unique and relatively inexpensive laboratory

and\nlife-prediction\nmodels in a simulated engine environment.\nThis will be accomplished in the high pressure burner rig facility which is currently under construction at Lewis.\nKey features of this facility are described in figure 7.\nThis unique facility will be dedicated to materials research and will offer\ntemperatures to 1650 \xc2\xb0 C (3000 \xc2\xb0 F) and pressures to 50 atmospheres.\nMETALLIC\n\nCOATING\n\nLIFE PREDICTION\n\nAs shown schematically\nin figure 8, metallic coatings protect structural\nalloys from the environment by providing a reservoir of a protective oxidescale-forming\nelement, for example, an aluminum bearing alloy which is selectively oxidized to form aluminum oxide.\nAluminum is depleted by oxidation and\nthermal-cycle-induced\noxide-scale spallation.\nAluminum is also diluted by\ninterdiffusion\nwith the substrate.\nExposure to corrosive salts may lead to\naccelerated\nhot corrosion attack of the oxide scale and coating.\nFinally, the\ncoating must withstand thermal-mechanical\nloads without degrading system\nmechanical\nresponse.\nThe metallic coating life-prediction thrust deals with the chemical and\nmechanical aspects of the problem.\nThe goal, approach, and status for this\nthrust are as follows:\nGoal:\nTo develop a coating life model for oxidation, spalling, hot corrosion,\nand coating/substrate\ndiffusion and to account for environmental\nand coating\neffects on mechanical response.\nApproach:\nEnvironment/mechanical\nproperty interactions\nSupport contract efforts managed by

building on\nexisting interdiffusion and cyclic oxidation/spalling\nmodels developed for\nmodel systems.\nThis task has proven far more difficult than envisioned due to\nspall measurement problems.\nThe hot corrosion efforts, one in-house and one\nunder contract with General Electric, were initiated in fiscal year 1983.\nThese three efforts are scheduled to culminate in a contractual\nlife prediction\nintegration and verification effort.\nThe roles of the environment and coatings on the mechanical responses of\nisotropic and anisotropic materials are being addressed by our support of contract efforts managed through the fatigue and fracture subproject.\nTHERMAL\n\nBARRIER\n\nCOATING\n\nLIFE PREDICTION\n\nThermal barrier coatings are presently used in noncritical\ngas-turbine\napplications\nto extend component life.\nPresent coatings suffer from limited\ncoating life and inadequate design capability when considered for more critical\napplications\nsuch as turbine airfoils.\nBoth life prediction and advanced\ncoatings are vital to the future use of TBC on airfoils for large improvements\nin system performance.\nStrong HOST support in the life-prediction\narea is now\nbeing provided.\nThe TBC life-prediction\nthrust has grown during the past year\nto become the major thrust of the surface protection subproject.\nThe direction\nof the thrust is shown in figure 9.
