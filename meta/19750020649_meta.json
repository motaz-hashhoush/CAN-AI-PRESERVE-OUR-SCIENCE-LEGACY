The mobile laboratory complex consisted of six laboratories that supported cardiovascular, metabolic, nutrition and endocrinology, operational medicine, blood, and microbiology experiments; a utility package; and two shipping containers. The objectives and equipment requirements of the Skylab mobile laboratory and the data acquisition systems are discussed along with processes such as permanently mounting equipment in the individual laboratories and methods of testing and transporting the units. The operational performance, in terms of amounts of data collected, and the concept of mobile laboratories for medical and scientific experiments are evaluated. The Skylab mobile laboratory succeeded in facilitating the data collection and sample preservation associated with the three Skylab manned flights.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19750020649, "id": "6916df1de2b7458da2cf94b69570b3fe", "publicationDate": "1975-07-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19750020649.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19750020649/downloads/19750020649.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19750020649/downloads/19750020649.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19750020649/downloads/19750020649.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
