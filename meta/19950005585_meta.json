In the robotics literature this is known as the sensor registration problem. The registration problem is important to solve if TRAC images need to be related to robot position. Previously, when TRAC operated on the end of a robot arm, the camera had to be precisely located at the correct orientation and position. If this location is in error, then the robot may not be able to grapple an object even though the TRAC sensor indicates it should. In addition, if the camera is significantly far from the alignment it is expected to be at, TRAC may give incorrect feedback for the control of the robot. A simple example is if the robot operator thinks the camera is right side up but the camera is actually upside down, the camera feedback will tell the operator to move in an incorrect direction. The automatic calibration algorithm requires the operator to translate and rotate the robot arbitrary amounts along (about) two coordinate directions. After the motion, the algorithm determines the transformation matrix from the robot end effector to the camera image plane. This report discusses the TRAC sensor registration problem.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19950005585, "id": "44640ebcd8f04204bde0ea8306ddb089", "publicationDate": "1994-09-21T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19950005585.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19950005585/downloads/19950005585.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19950005585/downloads/19950005585.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19950005585/downloads/19950005585.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
