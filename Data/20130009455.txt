b'Software\nSystem for Contributing and\nDiscovering Derived Mission\nand Science Data\nA system was developed to provide a\nnew mechanism for members of the mission community to create and contribute new science data to the rest of\nthe community. Mission tools have allowed members of the mission community to share first order data (data that is\ncreated by the mission\xe2\x80\x99s process in command and control of the spacecraft or\nthe data that is captured by the craft itself, like images, science results, etc.).\nHowever, second and higher order data\n(data that is created after the fact by scientists and other members of the mission) was previously not widely disseminated, nor did it make its way into the\nmission planning process.\nThis software allows members of the\nmission community to create and contribute second and higher order data\ninto the set of mission data for use in\nplanning and operations of a mission.\nThis kind of data is indexed and treated\nin the same way as first order data. The\ndata is discoverable by other users and\ncan be part of the planning process.\nThe system improves the ability to share\nresults, make discoveries, and aid in the\noperations of a mission. At the time of\nthis reporting, this capability was not\navailable in other software.\nThis work was done by Michael N. Wallick,\nMark W. Powell, Khawaja S. Shams, Megan\nC. Mickelson, Darrick M. Ohata, James A.\nKurien, and Lucy Abramyan of Caltech for\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

One common approach\nis text-based printouts on a terminal, but\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, January 2013\n\nit is very difficult to interpret large\namounts of data printed out on the\nscreen. Another challenge is that the\nnetwork connection to the robot might\nnot be reliable, where constantly monitoring the data at high bandwidth is impossible.\nThis software provides a Qt-based\nviewer that is intended to be used with\nonboard robotics software to visualize\nits internal states and the situational\nawareness of the robot. OpenGL is used\nto render vehicle/objects/ENC data,\netc. in 3D. It uses UDP (User Datagram\nProtocol) communication to talk to the\nonboard software, so each side of the\nrobot and the viewer program can be\nstopped and started at any time, and\nthe performance degrades graciously\nover lossy wireless communications\nlinks. It can also save a log of the viewer\nmessages and replay at various speeds,\nso that it can reconstruct and analyze\nwhat happens in the field trials. Other\nfeatures include QuickTime-based\nmovie creation, overlay of maps, and\ndisplay of ENC objects.\nThis software is easily adopted by\nother robotics projects. It serves as an\nengineering display for software debugging/monitoring, and also a tool to explain to sponsors/customers what the\nonboard navigation/perception/control algorithms are doing.\nThis work was done by Yoshiaki Kuwata,\nMichael Wolf, Terrance L. Huntsberger, and\nAndrew B. Howard of Caltech for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet\nPropulsion Laboratory. Further information is\ncontained in a TSP (see page 1). NPO-48126\n\nStackfile Database\nThis software provides storage retrieval and analysis functionality for\nmanaging satellite altimetry data. It improves the efficiency and analysis capabilities of existing database software with\nimproved flexibility and documentation.\nIt offers flexibility in the type of data that\ncan be stored. There is efficient retrieval\neither across the spatial domain or the\ntime domain. Built-in analysis tools are\nprovided for frequently performed altimetry tasks.\nThis software package is used for storing and manipulating satellite measurement data. It was developed with a focus\non handling the requirements of repeattrack altimetry missions such as Topex\n\nand Jason. It was, however, designed to\nwork with a wide variety of satellite measurement data [e.g., Gravity Recovery\nAnd Climate Experiment \xe2\x80\x94 GRACE).\nThe software consists of several command-line tools for importing, retrieving, and analyzing satellite measurement data.\nThis work was done by Robert deCarvalho,\nShailen D. Desai, Bruce J. Haines, Gerhard\nL. Kruizinga, and Christopher Gilmer of Caltech for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\nFor more information, contact iaoffice@\njpl.nasa.gov.\nThis software is available for commercial licensing.

The programs\nare \xe2\x80\x9cmarsreach\xe2\x80\x9d (for MER) and\n\xe2\x80\x9cphxreach.\xe2\x80\x9d These programs make use\nof the planetary image geometry (PIG)\nlibrary. However, unlike the other programs, they are not multi-mission. Because of the complexity of arm kinematics, the programs are specific to each\nmission.\nIn each case, the input consists of XYZ\nand surface normal data. The output is a\nmultiband image, co-registered to the\ninput image. Each band represents a\npredefined combination of arm instrument and arm configuration (e.g., elbow\nup, elbow down), and the value indicates whether or not the instrument can\nobserve (see or touch) the surface at the\ncorresponding pixel.\nThis software models the arm precisely, using the same algorithms as the\nflight software. It is thus uniquely suited\nto determining reachability and safety of\nrobot arm operations. The MER RAT instrument provides additional information beyond just a flag \xe2\x80\x94 it supplies a\n\xe2\x80\x9cpreload\xe2\x80\x9d value, which indicates how\nmuch force the arm can apply at that\nspot. The MER reachability program\nconsiders collisions of the arm with terrain in determining reachability; the\nPHX program does not.\n\n21\n\n'
