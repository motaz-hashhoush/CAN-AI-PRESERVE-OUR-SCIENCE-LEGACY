You also learn a lot\nabout science and history and literature. For instance, you will notice that NASA spacecraft have\ndifferent kinds of names. Some names come from\nmyths and legends, some are based on descriptions of their missions. The Space Shuttle orbiters\nwere named after sea vessels used in research and\nexploration, and others\xe2\x80\x94like Space Station\nFreedom\xe2\x80\x94grow out of a formal naming process\nwithin NASA. Each name and each project can\nlead to an exciting investigation - research, experiments - along with dreams for the future.\nNASA has a number of educational programs\nfor you and your teachers, for both classroom\ngroups and individual students. If you would like to\nknow more about them, ask your teacher to\ncontact the Educational Affairs Division, Code\nXEE, NASA, Washington, DC 20546.\n\nIn 1958, Congress created the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), an\nindependent agency of the federal government\n"devoted to the exploration of space for peaceful\npurposes for the benefit of all mankind."\nNASA\'s story is one of learning. It is a story of\nprogress from wind-tunnel models to research\naircraft, from sounding rockets to the Saturn V,\nfrom small satellites to complex spacecraft. It is the\nstory of humans traveling to the Moon and working in low-Earth orbit. Space probes have extended\nour vision to the outer planets, and scientific\nsatellites have introduced us to Earth\'s neighborhood and to mysteries at the edge of the universe.\nNASA, a network of many installations across\nthe United States, is headquartered in Washington, D.C. Each NASA Center has specific responsibilities for one or more of NASA\'s programs, such\nas aeronautics, scientific and Earth resources satellites, manned spaceflight, and propulsion. If you\n\nAitisi\t\n\nL 1I\t\n\nC\'t\t\n\niiih uibi\n\n1\n\nTHE SPACE\nTRANSPORTATION\nSYSTEM\nThe United States has been sending astronauts\ninto space since 1961. Until 1981, the National\nAeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)\nmanned programs\xe2\x80\x94Mercury, Gemini, Apollo, and\nSkylab - used launch vehicles and spacecraft that\nwent up only once. As the United States made\nprogress in its space program, it was decided that a\nspacecraft and launch vehicle that could be put up\ninto space more than one time was desirable. They\nwere supposed to lower the cost of space flight\nand make space flight increasingly routine.\nNASA was given the responsibility for developing this new transportation system. The Space Transportation System is NASA\'s name for the overall\nprogram producing the Space Shuttle.\nThe Space Shuttle is a remarkable flying machine. It takes off like a rocket. In earth orbit it\nmaneuvers like a spacecraft. It lands like a glider.\nThe main purpose of the Space Shuttle is to\ndeliver payloads to Earth orbit over and over again.\nThe astronauts aboard the Shuttle are able to deploy, repair, and retrieve satellites. They also can\nstudy Earth from space.\nThe Space Shuttle system consists of four primary parts. They are the orbiter, two solid rocket\nboosters, and an external fuel tank. NASA plans to\nreuse both the solid rocket boosters and the orbiter.\nThe orbiter is the main part of the Shuttle system. It carries the crew and payload to orbit and\nreturns the astronauts and some of the payloads to\nEarth. NASA expects to reuse the orbiter more\nthan 100 times. Five orbiters have been built to\ndate: the Enterprise, Columbia, Challenger,\nDiscovery, and Atlantis.\n\nOn April 12, 1981, the first Space Shuttle lifted\noff from Launch Complex 39, Pad A, at the Kennedy\nSpace Center (KSC) in Cape Canaveral, Florida.\nAfter a two-day test flight, it landed at Edwards Air\nForce Base in California.\n\nLooking at front view of the Space Shuttle, NASA\'s Space\nTransportation System\n\nTHE\nENTERPRISE\n\n-\n\n905\n\n777`pm^\n\nIn the Approach and Landing Test Program, the Enterprise is released from its piggyback position atop NASA\'s modified 747 to test how\nwell the spacecraft can glide to a runway landing after leaving orbit and returning to Earth.\n\n1985 , all of the orbiters except for the Enterprise\nhad made flights into space. Enterprise, the first\norbiter built, was never intended to go into space.\nInstead it was designed as a test vehicle to be flown\nin the atmosphere only, and was built to be identical to the future four orbiters in shape and weight.\nEnterprise was first used in the Approach and\nLanding Test (ALT) Program. NASA modified a\nBoeing 747 aircraft so that it could ferry Enterprise\non its back, and then also be used later to transport\nthe other Shuttles from various parts of the United\nStates to KSC.\nThe ALT program involved a total of 14 flights.\nFive flights were made with an unmanned Enterprise\nattached to the top of the 747. Two pilots then\nflew inside of Enterprise when it was still attached\nto the 747. Some of the Shuttle\'s flight systems\nwere tested at this time. During the last test flights,\nEnterprise was released from the 747 at an altitude of approximately 7.2 kilometers (24,000 feet),\nand the pilots onboard glided Enterprise to an\nunpowered landing.\nBy\n\nAll of these tests were made at Edwards Air Force\nBase in California. The purpose was to study the\nflight characteristics of the orbiter in the atmosphere.\nThe airframe and the mechanical and electrical\nparts of the orbiter were evaluated. The ALT test\nalso helped train controllers and ground crews.\nEnterprise was also used for a series of vibration\ntests at NASA\'s Marshall Space Flight Center in\nHuntsville, Alabama. At KSC, Enterprise was used\nto test the Shuttle mobile launch system. Enterprise\nwas then used in similar fit checks at the new Shuttle Launch Complex at Vandenburg Air Force Base,\nCalifornia.\nNASA gave the Space Shuttle orbiter Enterprise\nto the National Air and Space Museum on November 19, 1985. The Enterprise is now located at\nthe Dulles International Airport near Washington,\nD.C. Some day soon NASM hopes to build a new\nmuseum where the Enterprise and other large aircraft will be exhibited.\n\nTHE\nSHUTTLE\nORBITER\n\nS\n\nThe Shuttle\'s payload bay opened up\n\nThe orbiter is big! It is 37 meters long (122 feet).\nFrom wing tip to wing tip it spans 24 meters (78\nfeet). From the ground to the top of the vertical\nstabilizer, or tail, it stands 17 meters (57 feet) high.\nThe orbiter is about the size of a DC-9 airplane.\nThe orbiter is divided into three main parts. The\nforward part is called the crew module. It is where\nthe crew members stay while in space. The middle\nof the orbiter is called the payload bay. This is\nwhere the payloads are stored that are being hauled\ninto space. A payload can be a satellite to be\n0\n\ndeployed or instruments to view the Earth. The\nback of the orbiter is where the Shuttle\'s three\nmain engines are located.\nThe crew module is a three-section, pressurized\nworking, living, and storage compartment. It is in\nthis forward part of the Shuttle that the cockpit,\nliving quarters and experiment operator\'s stations\nare located. This area of the Shuttle is divided into\nthree levels: flight deck, mid-deck, and lower deck.\nThe flight deck is where the commander and\npilot fly the Shuttle. The crew can see beautiful\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 I\t\n\nI -\t\n\nI\t\n\nU I\t\n\nviews of Earth from the flight deck through any of\nthe six windshields, two overhead windows, or two\nrear-viewing payload bay windows.\nThe crew members must be well trained, since\nthere are 2,020 separate displays and controls on\nthe flight deck for use during flight. The payload\nsatellites and instruments in the payload bay are\noperated from the back part of the flight deck.\nThe mid-deck is the crew\'s home in space. It is\non the mid-deck where they prepare meals, use\nthe bathroom, and clean up. Sleeping quarters are\nalso on the mid-deck. Lockers are available on the\nmid-deck for storage of small equipment and\nclothing.\nThe crew members enter the left side of the\norbiter through a 1-meter (40-inch) circular hatch.\nOnce in orbit, the astronauts work in space by going\nthrough the airlock on the mid-deck. There is a\nladder on the mid-deck to get to the flight deck,\nbut no one needs to use the ladder in space, because you can float to the flight deck.\nThe lower deck is called the equipment bay.\nYou get to the equipment bay through removable\nfloor panels. Various parts of the environmental\ncontrol equipment are stored here. Wet trash is\nalso stored here.\nThe payload bay in the middle of the orbiter is\n18.3 meters (60 feet) long and 4.6 meters (15 feet)\nwide. You could easily fit a school bus into the\npayload bay for a trip to space. The orbiter can\ntransport up to 29,500 kilograms (65,000 pounds)\nof payload into orbit. It can bring back payloads\nweighing up to 14,500 kilograms (32,000 pounds).\nOnce in orbit, the two payload bay doors must\nbe opened. Each door contains four radiator panels that expel the orbiter\'s excess heat into space. If\nthe heat is not removed, the equipment in the\norbiter becomes too hot and the mission would\nhave to be cut short. A remote manipulator system\n(RMS) arm is often included in the payload bay.\nYou can use the arm to lift objects in and out of\nthe payload bay. Before returning to Earth, the\npayload bay doors must be closed.\nThe rear of the orbiter contains the Shuttle main\nengines, body flap, and vertical stabilizer. The three\nmain engines are fixed together to get the Shuttle\ninto orbit. The body flap is used during reentry into\nEarth\'s atmosphere to help protect the engines\nfrom the extreme heat of reentry. Wings located in\n\nI\nI\n\nI\n\nFlight deck\n\nMid-deck\n\nLower deck\nThe crew module\n\nthe middle of the orbiter are used when the orbiter\nis returning from space and traveling through the\natmosphere. The vertical stabilizer consists of a structural fin, which acts as a rudder and speed brake.\nThis rudder can be used to steer the orbiter in a\nright or left direction in its flight through the atmosphere. During landing the rudder can split in half\nto help slow down the orbiter.\nElectrical power for the Shuttle is produced by\nthree fuel cells in the orbiter. The fuel cells use\nhydrogen and oxygen to generate electricity. All\nthree fuel cells are used during peak energy power\nconditions. Only two fuel cells are used during minimum power conditions. The fuel cells can produce 15 to 20 kilowatts of power. Drinking water is\nan important by-product of fuel cell operation.\n\n5\n\n\t\n\nSOLID \t\nROCKET\t\nBOOSTERS\n\nAs a solid rocket booster tails back to tarth, it is slowea ty\nthree large parachutes. Because boosters are used many times,\nthey must not fall too fast or they will be damaged when they\nhit the ocean.\n\nI\n\non\n\nt takes a lot of energy to launch a spacecraft into\norbit. The Shuttle uses its main engines and two\nsolid rocket boosters (SRBs) to provide the thrust\nneeded to get to space. Thrust, often stated in\npounds, is the force produced by the rockets. One\npound of thrust is equal to 22 horsepower.\nOne SRB is attached to each side of the external\nfuel tank. Each one is a solid fuel rocket. (Firework\nrockets launched on the Fourth of July are also\nsolid fuel rockets.) SRB fuel is a mixture of aluminum and several other materials that help it burn.\nEach SRB produces 11.8 million neutrons (2.65\nmillion pounds) of thrust. Each is 45.5 meters (149\nfeet) tall and 3.6 meters (12 feet) wide. At launch\nan SRB weighs 590,000 kilograms (1.3 million\npounds).\nThe SRBs are fired only after the Shuttle\'s main\nengines have started. They burn for about the first\ntwo minutes of the flight. By the time the SRBs\nhave used all of their fuel, the Shuttle has gained\n45 kilometers (28 miles) in altitude.\nAt this time the SRBs separate from the Shuttle.\n\nII\nU..\nThey still have enough forward motion to carry\nthem up for another 70 seconds. At the end of this\ntime the SRBs have reached an altitude of 66 kilometers (41 miles). They then begin their fall into\nthe Atlantic Ocean. During the fastest part of their\nfall, the SRBs travel nearly 4,600 kilometers (2,900\nmiles) per hour.\nIt takes almost five minutes from the time the\nSRBs separate from the Shuttle for them to land in\nthe ocean. Three large parachutes slow the SRBs\nduring their fall to Earth. They hit the water at a\nspeed of 96 kilometers (60 miles) per hour, landing about 279 kilometers (169 miles) from the launch\nsite. Because the SRBs are to be reused, they are\nrecovered by two sea tugs. They are then returned\nto KSC, where they are cleaned up and refueled\nfor another flight.\nThe Shuttle made 24 successful flights. Then,\non January 28, 1986, during the 25th Shuttle flight,\na seal on the right SRB ruptured and led to the\ntragic destruction of the orbiter Challenger. All seven\ncrew members were killed. NASA and its contractors have redesigned the seals, called 0-rings, used\nbetween the segments of the solid rocket boosters\nso that no hot gas can now escape. This new design will make the Shuttle a safer spacecraft system\nfor future space travelers like yourself.\n\n1..\n\nstups retrieve Me 5huti!us otiu rui uuutrs\neco\t\nafter they have exhausted their fuel and fallen back to Earth.\nThey will be hauled back to shore for reuse on another\nShuttle flight.\n\nU\n\nThe Shuttle\'s three main engines are fueled by\nan external tank, really a huge gas tank. The tank\nhas three main parts. The top part stores the oxygen, and the bottom part, the hydrogen. In between is a section that connects the two tanks with\nall sorts of plumbing-like equipment. The outside\nof the external tank is covered with a material that\nprotects it from the heat of launch and early flight.\nThe forward part of the tank curves to a point to\nreduce aerodynamic drag. Its tip serves as a lightning rod for the Shuttle once it has cleared the\nlaunch tower.\nThe external tank contains the liquid fuels that\nthe Shuttle\'s main engines use during the first eight\nand one-half minutes of flight. The tank is the only\nmajor part of the Shuttle that is not reused. It is 47\nmeters (154 feet) long and 9 meters (29 feet) wide.\n\nSide view of the Space Shuttle\n\nTHE\nEXTERNAL\nTANK\n\nThe external fuel tank is carried to the Vehicle Assembly\nBuilding in the background, where it will be joined to the two\nsolid rocket boosters and the orbiter.\n\nIt weighs about 35,000 kilograms (78,000 pounds)\nwhen empty. Full, the tank weighs 755,787 kilograms (1,667,667 pounds).\nThe Shuttle\'s three main engines bum large quantities of liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen. In fact,\nwhen completely fueled, the Shuttle contains\n541,000 liters (143,000 gallons) of liquid oxygen\nand 1.45 million liters (383,000 gallons) of liquid\nhydrogen. These fuels have to be stored in the\ntank at very cold temperatures. Liquid oxygen\'s\nstorage temperature is -183 degrees Celsius (-297\ndegrees Fahrenheit), while hydrogen is -253 degrees Celsius (-423 degrees Fahrenheit). The Fahrenheit temperature scale is the temperature scale\nthat is used in your home.\nAt launch the Shuttle uses about 63,600 liters\n(16,800 gallons) of liquid oxygen and almost\n170,000 liters (45,000 gallons) of liquid hydrogen\neach minute. By burning these liquid fuels, each\nmain engine can produce up to 1.7 million neutrons (375,000 pounds) of thrust. By the time the\nmain engines shut down, the Shuttle has gained\n112 kilometers (70 miles) in altitude.\nThe external tank is released from the Shuttle\n10 to 15 seconds after the Shuttle\'s main engines\nshut down. Once released, it begins to tumble. It\nreenters Earth\'s atmosphere and breaks up. Pieces\nof the tank land in the Indian Ocean 58 minutes\nlater.\n7\n\nASTRONAUT\nTRAINING\nA\n\nTraining at the Jo non Space Flight Center\'s flight simulator\nfor mission STS 7 are astronauts (left to right) Robert\nCrippen, Frederick Hauck, John Fabian, and Sally Ride.\n\nAs a member of a flight crew, you would have\nlots of jobs to do aboard the Shuttle. You would be\nput in charge of some aspect of the flight. As commander, for example, you would fly the Shuttle\nand be in charge of the mission. If assigned to be\nthe pilot, you would assist the commander with\nflying the spacecraft. As a mission specialist, you\nwould be in charge of the experiments and payloads being carried aboard the Shuttle. The commander, pilot, and mission specialists work for NASA\nMost Shuttle astronauts plan on going into space\nseveral times during their NASA careers.\nFrom time to time, a scientist, engineer, or physician who does not work for NASA will take a flight\ninto space to oversee an experiment. These individuals are called payload specialists. They conduct experiments or observe the deployment of a\npayload for their sponsor. They will probably travel\nto space only once or, at most, just a few times.\nYou must receive training before you can go\ninto space. It is not unusual to begin training several years before flight time. Your job aboard the\norbiter determines the type of training you would\nreceive.\nYou would probably train in the various flight\nsimulators at NASA\'s Johnson Space Center in\nHouston, Texas. You experience zero gravity by\n1s]\n\nflying in a special NASA aircraft called KC-135.\nDuring parts of the flight, you will briefly float in\nfree fall around the inside of the aircraft.\nIf you are to work outside the orbiter in space,\nyou would train in a large tank of water. The underwater world is very much like the world of space,\nand the astronauts practice their assignments over\nand over again wearing their spacesuits in this huge\ntank. The commander and pilot also use a Shuttle\ntraining aircraft to practice Shuttle approach and\nlanding procedures.\nClassroom instruction is another important part\nof training. During your studies, you learn all about\nthe Shuttle. You also learn about guidance, navigation, the effects of microgravity on your body,\nand many other related subjects.\nIf you are to be a payload specialist, most of\nyour training would concern the payload you are\nto operate. The company or organization that is\nsending you up would coordinate most of your\ntraining.\nBefore you go into space, you would most cer-\n\n-,\n\nAstronaut Rick Hauck trains for zero gravity aboard the\nKC-135.

This huge\nswimming pool is used because the underwater world and\nthe world of space are much alike. Astronauts master all\nEVA activities here before going into space.\n\ntainly also need to know about crew operations,\nhousekeeping, and Shuttle emergency procedures.\nIt is also every astronaut\'s responsibility to keep\nhimself or herself in excellent physical condition.\nOnce assigned to a flight crew, you would train\nwith the other crew members to prepare for the\nflight. As training progresses, the crew and the flight\ncontrollers practice an entire mission in a joint training exercise that proves everything is go for the\nreal flight.\n\nI\n\nGETTING\nTo\nSPACE\n\nI\n0\n\n(Jo/urn bia rises off Launch Pad 39 A tor it ,, second mission.\nThis STS-2 mission carried astronauts Joe Engle and Richard\nTruly along with a payload of scientific experiments.\n\nI\n\nmagine you are a highly trained specialist on your\nfirst Shuttle flight. As a Shuttle crew member you\nleave the astronaut quarters for the Shuttle about\ntwo hours before liftoff. You enter the orbiter through\nthe 1-meter (40-inch) diameter circular hatch located on the left side of the mid-deck.\nThe commander, pilot, mission specialist, and\none payload specialist sit on the flight deck. Seats\nfor three other crew members are located on the\nmid-deck. After the crew is seated, you all strap\nyourselves in. You are now on your back in a re10\n\ndining seat awaiting launch. Your heartbeat speeds\nup; the adventure is about to begin!\nThe last 30 minutes before launch is a busy time.\nEverything must be checked out. The five computers on board are helping the crew to check all parts\nof the orbiter, external tank, and solid rocket boosters. Each of the computers can make nearly 325,000\noperations each second. The crew will depend on\nthe computers throughout the whole mission.\nThe final few seconds before liftoff look like this:\n\ns-u\n\xe2\x80\xa21\xe2\x80\xa2U\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nU.\t\n\nU U U\t\nW\t\n\nU\n\nU\n\nAbout eight and one-half minutes into\nthe flight, the main engines cut off. The\nbig tank is released about 10 to 15\nseconds later. It breaks up and falls into\nthe Indian Ocean.\ntip\n\n4\t\n\nU\t\nH\t\nH\t\n\nA\t\n\n//\t\n/7\t\n\nAbout six and one-half minutes into flight,\nthe Shuttle begins a long, shallow dive\nto prepare for external tank separation.\nThe Shuttle is now at 128 kilometers (80\nmiles) in altitude. At the end of the dive,\nthe orbiter will be 115 kilometers (72\nmiles) above Earth. All aboard the orbiter\nwill feel three Gs of acceleration. (The\npull of gravity is measured in Gs.)\nAbout two minutes into flight, the solid\nrocket boosters burn out. The orbiter is\nnow about 45 kilometers (28 miles) in\naltitude. The SRBs separate seven seconds later and begin to fall into the\nAtlantic Ocean.\n\nThe Shuttle vibrates and shakes, and\nthe crew can hear lots of metallic bangs\nand clanks.\nAbout 70 seconds into flight, the orbiter\nreaches maximum dynamic pressure.\n\nTHE CREW IS ON ITS WAY!\nIf they are working properly, the solid\nrocket boosters fire about one-third of a\nsecond before liftoff. Three and one-half\nseconds later, the orbiter clears the launch\ntower.\nAbout six seconds before liftoff, the three\nShuttle main engines start.\n\nAbout two minutes later, the Orbital\nManeuvering System (OMS), the smaller\nengines inside that allow the orbiter to\nmove about in orbit, fire. This OMS burn\nwill continue for nearly two minutes. At\nthe end of the burn, the orbiter will be in\nan elliptical orbit around Earth.\n\nApproximately 45 minutes after launch,\nthe OMS engines fire again to place the\norbiter in a nearly circular orbit about\n320 kilometers (200 miles) above Earth.\nIMAGINE! YOU ARE NOW IN ORBIT!\n\n*\n\nRAI\n\n10\n0\n\nOnce in orbit, it is important to open the payload bay doors to get rid of the orbiter\'s excess\nheat.\nIt\'s time now to stow the crew seats and get to\nwork. But in addition to working, Shuttle astronauts must know how to accomplish all the everyday tasks of life. Because you may wish to join a\nShuttle crew some year in the future, let\'s look at\nlife on board an orbiting Shuttle spacecraft.\n11\n\nORBITING IN\nTHE WORLD OF\t\n\nU\n\nWEIGHTLESSNESS\nYour Shuttle launch into space will be from\n\nKennedy Space Center in Florida, which borders\non the Atlantic Ocean. Because the Shuttle will\nlaunch over the Atlantic, nearby communities are\nin no danger from a possible accident.\nYour path around and above Earth is called an\nEarth orbit. For the Shuttle to orbit Earth, it must\ntravel at nearly 8 kilometers (5 miles) per second.\nThe velocity needed to orbit Earth decreases the\nfarther you get from Earth. This is because the pull\nof Earth\'s gravity decreases as you move away\nfrom our planet.\nFor an altitude aboveEarth of Velocity required is\n160 km (100 ml) 7.76 km (4.85 mi) a second\n320 km (200 ml) 7.66 km (4.79 mi) a second\n35,680 km (22,300 mi) 2.86 km (1.79 mi) a second\n\nThe farther you travel from Earth, the longer it\ntakes to complete one orbit:\nFor 160 meters (100 miles), it takes 88 minutes.\nFor 320 meters (200 miles), it takes 91 minutes.\nFor 33,450 meters (22,300 miles), it takes 24 hours.\n\nFrom an altitude of 480 kilometers (300 miles),\nyou can see the entire United States from coast to\ncoast. At this altitude it will take you about 12\nminutes to cross the United States in the orbiter.\nSome types of orbits that you should be familiar\nwith are circular, geosynchronous, elliptical, and\npolar.\nA circular orbit is one in which your distance\nabove the surface of Earth remains constant.\n\nA circular orbit\t\n\n12\n\nA geosynchronous orbit is one in which a spacecraft orbits 35,680 kilometers (22,300 miles) above\nthe equator in a circular orbit. From Earth, the\nspacecraft seems to remain fixed in the sky, because the spacecraft goes around Earth in the same\namount of time as Earth turns on its axis.\nIn an elliptical orbit your distance above Earth\'s\nsurface is not constant. When you are at perigee,\nyou are at the closest point in your orbit above the\nEarth\'s surface. At apogee you are at the most\ndistant point in your orbit.\nIf you fly around the Earth in a polar orbit, you\npass over Earth near the north and south poles.\nHow far the orbiter passes north or south of the\nequator depends on your launch angle. A due east\nlaunch from KSC would put you in an orbit inclined 28.5 degrees to the equator.\nBecause the crew must make sure that the solid\nrocket boosters and external tank will not hit land\nupon reentry, there is a limit to how far north or\nsouth you can launch. From KSC, launch to the\nnorth is limited to the southeast portion of Newfoundland; launch to the south is limited to the\nBahama Islands. Because of these restrictions, the\nfarthest north or south that the orbiter can travel\nfrom a launch at KSC is 57 degrees above or below the equator.\nBefore you even enter the orbiter, however, you\nwill have to put on your space suit. First you get\ninto a cooling and ventilation garment that looks\nlike long underwear with plastic tubing sewn in.\nWater will flow through the tubing to keep you\n\n0\nA geosynchronous orbit\t\n\n1p\n\nAn elliptical orbit\t\n\nA polar orbit\n\nU\t\n.1\n\n1\n\n1!!\t\n\n-I\n\xe2\x80\xa2\nenergy in space. This is because it is difficult to\nremain in one spot, and you must keep track of\nyour tools, which can easily float away.\nYou will also notice some physical changes to\nyour body. Body fluids will shift from your lower\nbody to your upper body. Because of the fluid\nshifts in your body, you will notice that you do not\nget thirsty. Your face will become puffy and you\nmay get the sniffles. At the same time your legs will\nget thinner. You may find yourself not functioning\nat 100 percent capacity during the first three days\nin orbit. You will probably grow a few centimeters\n(an inch or so) in height. But don\'t worry. You will\nreturn to normal on your return to Earth.\n\nObj ects not hold doon fl at around insidc ti cubti\nwith the Shuttle in orbit, its forward motion exactly counter\nbalances the downward pull of Earth\'s gravity.

First\nyou put on the trouser assembly. Then you are\nready to put on the upper part of the suit. At this\ntime you connect the cooling and ventilation garment to the portable life support system. This system, which you carry into the orbiter, provides oxen\nand suit pressurization until you are in orbit.

Utensils, tray, and trash must be stowed before returning to work.\nEveryone takes turns preparing meals. There is\nno kitchen on the orbiter. Instead, the meals are\nprepared at the galley installed on the mid-deck.\nThe galley has hot and cold water, an oven for\nwarming some of the food packages, and a place\nto stow the meal trays.\nThe galley also contains packages of catsup, mustard, mayonnaise, taco sauce, and hot pepper sauce.\nSalt and pepper are also available.

The food in\nthe pantry is most often used for snacks and beverages between meals. Food for each day is stored\nin a food locker. Each food package is identified by\na colored dot. Each crew member is assigned a\ndifferent colored dot for the mission.\nSome fresh foods are taken into space. These\ninclude such items as bread, fruit, and carrot and\ncelery sticks. They must be eaten during the first\nfew days in orbit, because they will not stay fresh.\nThere is no refrigerator or freezer on the orbiter.\nAll food, therefore, must be precooked or processed\nso that it does not require refrigeration. The food\npackages are either ready to eat or can be prepared simply by adding water or by heating.\nSome of the foods are freeze-dried. This means\nthat the water was removed from the food before\nlaunch. During the flight, water is added back to\nthe food just before it is eaten.\nThe weight of the food and the food packages\nfor one day is almost three and-a-half pounds and\nwill give you about 2,800 calories of food each\nday.\nFood preparations start 30 to 60 minutes before\nmealtime.

For this reason, you must\ntake sponge baths in space. You must also use the\nhandwashing enclosure when cleaning your hands.\nFor the seven-day stay in space, you will get seven\nwashcloths and three towels.\nEach crew member has a personal hygiene kit.\nA kit might include a razor and shaving cream (for\nmen only), stick deodorant, nail clippers, comb and\nbrush, dental floss, toothbrush, toothpaste, and soap.\nAfter brushing your teeth, you must either swallow your toothpaste or spit it into a towel.

Some crew members have slept in the commander and pilot\'s seats on the flight deck. Most\noften the crew members use sleeping bags called\nsleep restraints. You would probably want to tie\nyour sleep restraint to something so that you do\nnot float around during the night. If you do not\ntuck your arms into the sleep restraint, they tend to\nfloat out in front of you. There is no up or down so\nyou can sleep in any direction.

On\nmost flights, the entire crew goes to bed at the\nsame time. However, during Spacelab missions,\nsome of the crew will stay up to operate the lab.\nIf you participate in a Shuttle mission some day,\ndo not expect to get much sleep during your first\nnight in space. The excitement of the launch and\nyour first day in orbit will probably keep you awake.\nBy the second or third night, however, you\'ll sleep\nnormally.\nYour schedule will allow you up to eight hours\nof sleep a night. Forty-five minutes are included to\nget ready for bed. Another forty-five minutes are\nallowed for you to get dressed and cleaned up in\nthe morning.\nDuring each 90-minute orbit, the sun rises and\nsets two times. For this reason, the fluorescent lights\nare left on all the time. Because the orbiter is never\ncompletely dark, the orbiter is equipped with window shades and sleep masks to keep the light out\nof your eyes while you are sleeping. Ear plugs are\nalso available to reduce the noise of the orbiter.\nIf everyone does go to bed at the same time, at\nleast one person has to wear a communications\ncarrier to hear the ground calls.

Instead, they wear very\ncomfortable clothes. However, if you\'re not careful\nwhile dressing, you can start spinning.\nAll of the clothing, except for the underwear, is\ndesigned for use by both sexes. Crew members do\nnot change their entire wardrobe each day. They\nonly change their underwear daily. Socks and\nshirts are changed every three days. Trousers are\ngood for seven days. Only one jacket is issued for\nthe flight.\nBoth the jacket and trousers are cobalt blue in\ncolor. Cotton knit shirts are navy blue, with short\nsleeves. The jacket and trousers have many pockets for carrying personal items such as pens, pencils, and scissors. The pockets do not have buttons.\nInstead, they close with either zippers or Velcro.\nPutting on your trousers in space will be a lot\ndifferent than on Earth. You pick up both your\nfeet, bend both of your knees toward your stomach, hold the trousers out from your body, and\npush your feet down both legs at once!\nClothing and many other small items used during the flight are stored in lockers with insertable\ntrays. Almost all of the lockers are on the middeck. Each tray is packed so that no item covers\nanother unless the items are alike.

Each locker can hold up to 27\nkilograms (60 pounds).\nA medical kit is stored aboard the mid-deck of\nthe orbiter. It contains bandages as well as medicines such as pills and ointments. The crew has\naccess to a doctor at any time by using the communications network to Earth. On several flights,\nastronauts have reported mild headaches. Doctors\nhad them take aspirin from the medical kit. Equipment is also on board to treat very sick or injured\ncrew members until they can return to Earth.\n\n\xe2\x80\x94 SEEING, HEARING,\nAND EXERCISING\n.\t\n- \xe2\x80\xa2\nIN SPACE\niTtT;TT\n/\n\nyour heart from weakening, you must exercise each\nday that you are in space. Exercising in space is a\nlot different than exercising on Earth. In orbit it is\neasy to do one-hand push-ups, or lift 459.6 kilograms (1,000 pounds). Exercising in space requires\nspecial equipment. You must use the exercise treadmill made from apiece of teflon. After you attach\nthe treadmill to a floor or wall, you must put on a\nspecial belt and shoulder harness. The belt and\nshoulder harness will hold you down so that you\ncan run in place on the treadmill. The tension in\nthe harness can be adjusted to make you work\nharder.\nFor missions less than seven days long, you should\nexercise 15 minutes each day.

If you do not wear glasses\non Earth, you will not need them in space.\nYou will be able to see stars out of the orbiter\'s\nwindows. Because you are looking at them from\nabove the Earth\'s atmosphere, the stars do not\ntwinkle, and surprisingly, may appear a bit smaller\nto you than if you were seeing them from Earth.\nEarth looks majestic from space. You will see it\npainted with all sorts of beautiful colors. The various blues of the oceans and the greens and browns\nof the mountains are spectacular.

The commander or pilot can also\nfly the orbiter from the back part of the orbiter.\nFrom here the orbiter can be pointed in the proper\ndirection for a special payload operation.\nTo operate some of the payloads, you might\nhave to use the remote manipulator system (RMS).\nThe RMS is a mechanical arm 15 meters (50 feet)\nlong contributed to the Shuttle program by Canada. It can move objects in and out of the payload\nbay. The RMS is operated from the back part of\nthe flight deck.\n\nHousekeeping is essential in space, and includes emptying\nthe trash. Jack Lousma, STS-3 crew commander, is shown\nhere with almost a week\'s trash in the mid-deck area aboard\nColumbia.\n\nWell\n\nDuring a Shuttle mission, you would have tasks\nto do during all your waking hours. You would\nspend some of your time keeping the orbiter clean\nand in operational condition. Everyone helps with\nsuch housekeeping chores.\nDuring the flight, the crew takes turns running\nthe vacuum cleaner to clean the orbiter and the\nvarious air filters. The trash will need to be emptied. The equipment in the galley and waste management areas will need to be wiped down. One\nimportant job is changing the carbon dioxide absorbers, which filter the carbon dioxide from the\nrecirculated air to keep the air fresh.\nMost of your working time would be devoted to\nconducting experiments. For some of the experiments the only thing that the crew has to do is turn\nthe experiments on and off. Some experiments will\nbe done on the mid-deck, others in the payload\nbay.\nCrew members must also deploy satellites into\nspace from the orbiter.

Bruce McCandless prepares\nfor his spacewalk on STS-41-B.\n\nYour Shuttle crew might have jobs to do outside\nthe orbiter as well as inside. You might have to\nretrieve a satellite near the orbiter and bring it to\nthe payload bay for return to Earth, or repair it and\nreturn it to orbit. This type of work is called extravehicular activity (EVA).\nOutside the orbiter is space - a very harsh world\nin which to work. You no longer have the orbiter to\nprotect you from its dangers.\nIn space, the side of your body facing the sun\ncould reach temperatures of up to 121 degrees\nCelsius (250 degrees Fahrenheit) if not protected.\nAt the same time, your shady side could be a chilling -101 degrees Celsius (-150 degrees Fahrenheit). You would have no air to breathe. In the\nvacuum of space, your blood would boil and turn\nto gas. You must guard against harmful ultraviolet\nradiation from the sun. A micrometeroid might hit\nyou. You can see, of course, why you would wear a\nspacesuit to work in space. The Shuttle spacesuit\nand the back part that provides life support is properly referred to as the extravehicular mobility unit\n(EMU).\n22\n\n4=\n\nM\n2""\n\n0\n\n0\n\nII\nAbout three hours before your scheduled EVA,\nyou would begin breathing pure oxygen. You\ndo this to remove the nitrogen from your blood so\nthat you will not get the bends. The bends is a\ncondition where gas bubbles collect in your joints\nand blood. It can kill you.\nAbout 30 minutes prior to EVA, you would enter\nthe Shuttle in airlock. The airlock is located on the\nmid-deck. It is 1.6 meters (63 inches) wide and 2.1\nmeters (83 inches) tall and has two pressure-sealing\nhatches. The spacesuits are stowed here.\nNow you are ready to don your suit once more.\nThis time you strap the portable life support systern on you back so you hands are free to work in\nspace.\nNow you must check out your suit by closing the\nftttch to the mid-deck and removing the air from\ne airlock. If the suit checks out, you can open the\nouter hatch and enter the payload bay to begin\ny our walk in space. The display unit will tell you the\nstatus of your oxygen supply and suit pressure, as\nwell as the time elapsed since your EVA began.\nSome EVAs may require the use of the manned\nmaneuvering unit (MMU). The MMU allows astronauts to jet from the orbiter to a nearby satellite.\nNitrogen gas is used to propel the MMU. With the\n\nAl\n\nI\t\nOutside the Shuttle, astronauts work in protective space suits.\nHere, F. Story Musgrave (left) and Donald H.

Most tasks are accomplished in much less\ntime. Once you have finished your EVA, you reenter the orbiter through the outer hatch. After cbsing the outer hatch, you can repressurize the airlock\nand remove your spacesuit.\n\nWearing an MMU, Dale Gardner propels himself to the\nnearby Westar IV satellite, which needs repair. The satellite\n\'i1l be retrieved, placed in the cargo bay, and returned to\nEarth, where it will be fixed.\n\nThe MMU gives an astronaut freedom to explore areas\noutside the cargo bay. Bruce McCandless flies his MMU\nuntethered and in complete control of his movements.\n\n23\n\nRETURNING\nTo\nEARTH\n\nU. U\na\n\nTwenty-three minutes to touchdown,\nyour speed is 24,000 kilometers (15,000\nmiles) per hour. The elevons can now\nalso control the pitch motion of the\norbiter.\n\nColumbia returns home after its first flight. The landing is\nnearly perfect as commander Thomas Mattingly and pilot\nHenry Hartsfield set down at Edwards Air Force Base in\nCalifornia.\n\nAfter a typical mission of seven days, the crew\nwill have finished all its tasks. If you were on board,\nyou would take one last look at beautiful Earth\nfrom space. It\'s time now to get ready for your trip\nhome. About two hours before landing, you will\nreturn to your seat.\nOnce the payload bay doors are closed and\nlocked, the orbiter is turned to point tail first in its\norbit. The reaction control system (RCS) engines\nare used to do this. These engines are located at\nthree places on the orbiter. One set is at the front\nbetween the nose and the flight deck. The other\ntwo sets are on the orbital maneuvering pods. The\nRCS engines can make the orbiter turn in any\ndirection in space; these turns are called pitch,\nroll, and yaw maneuvers.\nAbout 60 minutes beforelanding, the\nOMS engines fire for two to three minutes. This burn slows the orbiter down\nabout 320 kilometers (200 miles) per\nhour. Using the RCS, the orbiter turns\nonce again so that its nose is pointing\nforward.\n\n24\n\nIt is almost 30 minutes to landing. You\nare now about 122 kilometers (76 miles)\nin altitude and traveling 27,360 kilometers (17,100 miles) per hour. The orbiter\nhas a thermal protection system that\nwithstands the high temperature conditions in space and the searing heatof\nreentry. The system consists of two types\nof heat tiles that provide special insulation. In just five minutes, you will be 94\nkilometers (59 miles) above the Earth\nand traveling at a speed of 26,720 kilometers (16,700 miles) per hour. At this\ntime a communications blackout begins.\nThe blackout is caused by ionizing particles surrounding the orbiter as the heat\ntiles reflect the heat upon reentering\nthe atmosphere. Once the orbiter is within the atmosphere, the elevons on the\nwings can control the roll motion of\nthe orbiter.\nYou begin your reentry with the orbiter\'s\nnose pointing up at an angle between\n28 and 38 degrees. With just a little over\n30 minutes to landing, you inflate your\nanti-G suit. This suit prevents you from\nfainting during reentry. Remember, at\nliftoff you were lying on your back. During\nreentry you are sitting upright in your\nseat. If you do not use your anti-G suit,\nblood would drain from your head to the\nlower part of your body when you leave\nthe weightlessness of space, and you\nwould black out.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 N.\niN.

U\na\n\n\\\\\n\nA Space Station now being developed, Freedom, will be a\n\nE\n\npermanent community in space, where astronauts and\nscientists can live and work while orbiting Earth.\n\nxploration on Earth or in space involves risks,\nand there can be setbacks along the way. Nevertheless, humankind must keep the spirit of exploration alive whether exploring the oceans of Earth\nor the oceans of space. Our star sailors have to be\nbrave and willing to accept the risks that accompany space exploration. And all of us must support\nthem in their endeavors.\nWe will long remember the Challenger tragedy.\nThese brave astronauts were willing to take on the\ndangers of space flight because they had a vision\nof the great possibilities that lay ahead. We must\ncontinue to expand that vision.\nSpace holds new challenges. In the not-too-distant\nfuture, we will have a Space Station in orbit. Crews\nof astronauts will circle Earth for up to ninety days\n28\n\nin the Space Station. It is hoped that these astronauts will perform scientific experiments, produce\nnew medicines, and even lay the base for space\nindustries that need a microgravity environment\nfor optimum success.\nPerhaps we will return to the Moon to establish\nMoon settlements. Maybe the people living in the\nlunar settlements will be testing and advancing technology to carry us to the asteroids, to Mars, and\nbeyond.\nPerhaps you will be a member of the first crew to\njourney to Mars. The important thing for you to do\nnow is study hard and dream dreams of tomorrow.\nTHE FUTURE BELONGS TO YOU!\n\n'
