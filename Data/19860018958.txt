E. Parks and I. Katz\nS-CUBED\nP. 0. Box 1620, La Jo!la, CA 92038\nABSTRACT\nRecent data from ground and space experiments indicate that plasma\nreleases from an object dramatically reduce the sheath impedance between\nthe object and the ambient plasma surrounding it. Available data is in\nqualitative accord with the theory developed below to quantify the flow\nof current in the sheath. Electron transport in the theory is based on\na fluid model of a col Iisionless plasma with an effective collision\nfrequency comparable to frequencies of plasma oscillations. The theory\nleads to low effective impedances varying inversely with the square root\nof the injected plasma density. To support such a low impedance mode of\noperation using an argon plasma source for example, requires Ip - I./30;\nthat is, only one argon ion must be injected for each thirty electrons\nextracted from the ambient plasma. The required plasma flow rates are\nquite low; to extract one ampere of electron current requires a mass\nflow rate of about one gram of argon per day.\nINTRODUCTION\nThe electrodynamic tethered satellite system requires the ejection\nof electrons from the shuttle at one end of the system and the\ncollection of a compensating current by the satellite at the other end.\nWhile the simplest concept is to collect electrons on the subsatellite\nand to collect a corresponding number of positive ions on the shuttle\narbiter, ion collection by the arbiter is acknowledged to be inadequate\n* This work supported by NASA/Lewis Research Center, Cleveland, OH\n44135 under Contract No. NAS3-23881.\n500\n\nto support the desired levels of current. The baseline configuration\nhas an electron gun mounted on the shuttle. To obtain ampere sized\ncurrents, assuming a perveance of 6 x 10~6 amperes/volt3\'2, requires\nthousands of volts across the gun. This voltage drop corresponds to an\neffective emission impedance of thousands of ohms. An alternative\nmethod of emitting electrons from the shuttle is creating a high density\nplasma in the vicinity of the shuttle. Calculations presented below\nshow sheath impedances are dramatically reduced by the use of hollow\ncathode plasma sources.\nPassive collection of ampere level electron currents by the\ntethered satellite is simple in concept; however, there is also a\nsubstantial sheath impedance associated with the flow of charge between\nthe tethered satellite and the ambient space plasma environment.\nTheory L J predicts that the extraction of amperes of electron current by\na sphere of 1.5 meter diameter requires a potential of ki lovolts. This\nhigh impedance collection is in substantial accord with the results of\nthe Plasma Interaction Flight Experiment (FIX) I \xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2 which collected only a\nn\nfew mi I Iiamperes of current with a k i l o v o l t bias on a 2000 cm solar\npanel. Both theory and flight data demonstrate clearly the need to\nincrease the current flow between the TSS and the space plasma.\nOne way to collect more electrons is to increase the diameter of\nthe tethered satellite, but this is impractical for TSS-1. Another way\nis to increase the plasma current in the v i c i n i t y of the subsatelIite.\nThis can be done by mounting a plasma source, such as a hollow cathode,\non the subsatelIite. The SEPAC electron beam experiments conducted on\nSpace Lab I indicate plasma sources to be an effective means for\nneutralizing beam currents and controlling spacecraft potentials.^\nWhen a plasma cloud was ejected along with a 5 keV, 0.3 amp electron\nbeam, the spectrum of returning electrons was confined to energies below\nthe beam energy, and the orbiter potential was clamped to a small value\n\n501\n\non the order of 1 volt. When the plasma jet was not active, however,\nthe electron energy spectrum developed a peak at 1.1 keV and there were\nsignificant fluxes of electrons above the primary beam energy. The\nSEPAC experiments provide clear evidence of the low impedance\nneutralization of a high current electron beam by a plasma plume.\nThe next section gives a brief review of some properties of hollow\ncathode sources. The following sections develop a model for estimating\nthe impedance to current flow across the plasma produced by the hollow\ncathode source, and determines the rate of plasma production required to\nsupport a low impedance mode of current collection.\nHOLLOW CATHODE PLASMA SOURCES\nOne device for generating a contactor plasma is the hollow\ncathode. Hollow cathode devices have played a prominent role in space\napplications, especially in the development of ion thrusters for solar\nelectric propulsion systems. Ion beams ejected by ion accelerators were\ncharge and current neutralized by electron currents flowing from the\ncathode through the plasma generated by the hollow cathode. The concept\nof the hollow cathode as a beam neutralizer was successfully\nincorporated into the SERT II satellite, and performed in space flight\ntests in the manner expected on the basis of tests conducted in high\nvacuum laboratory faciIities.i J\nThe hollow cathode is a compact, low impedance device. The\nsimplified features of one such device are indicated schematically in\nFigure 1. t5]\n\n502\n\nBarlua Coated Insert\n\nKeeper Electrode\n\nr\n\n^r^J\nNeutral Gis Fl<\n\n\\\n\nFlow\n\n^Ml\nO\n\nO\n\n^\n\nHeating Coll\n\nFigure 1.\n\ntnode-^\n\nSchematic diagram of a hollow cathode configuration.t^\n\nA neutral gas, such as mercury or argon, flows into the cathode\nchamber where it is ionized by field accelerated electrons emitted,from\nthe coated insert or chamber w a l l s through thermionic or other\nprocesses. The keeper electrode assists in initiating and in\nstabilizing the electrical discharge. With these devices nearly\ncomplete ionization of the neutral gas can be achieved, the resulting\nplasma flowing through the orifice at the net upstream flow rate.\nVarious devices of this type have been operated at mass flow rates\nranging from micrograms per second to grams per second, with currents\nranging from mi I Iiamperes to kiloamperes.[5,6,7] por app|jcatjons to\nthe electrodynamic tethered satellite system, primary interest attaches\nto the low flow rate, low current range.\nThe hollow cathode used in the SERT experiment had a length of\nabout 10 cm, an external diameter of about one-half centimeter and an\norifice diameter of about 1 mm. It used Hg as the operating gas.\nMercury flow rates of the order of 100 ma equivalent, or less,\nneutralized beam currents of order of 250 ma, w h i l e developing potential\n\n503\n\ndifferences no greater than a few tens of volts between various vehicle\nsurfaces and the neutralizing plasma. Hollow cathodes employed in the\nelectrodynamic tether experiment may have physical characteristics\nsimilar to those used in the SERT test, but should be flexible enough to\npermit the generation of a substantial range of plasma densities near\nthe vehicle.\nExperiments show that the properties of the plasma generated by\nthe hollow cathode depend upon whether it operates in its spot or plume\nmode.I J More complete ionization, higher plasma densities and electron\ntemperatures, and a lower electrical impedance of the discharge\ngenerally characterize the spot mode. The plume mode is characterized\nby less efficient ionization, a lower plasma density and a higher\nelectrical impedance to the flow of discharge current than the spot\nmode. A higher rate of gas flow, shorter cathode to anode distance and\na higher discharge current tend to produce the spot mode.

In the space flight\ntests electrons were transported long distances from their source along\nthe path of neutralized high energy ion beams. There have not been\nexperiments which bear upon the question of how effectively electron\ncurrents may flow from hollow cathode sources into the ambient plasma in\nthe absence of an ion beam. Thus, the conclusions reached below must be\nregarded as tentative.\nExperiments conducted in ground facilities indicate that the\nplasma, despite long classical collision?! mean free paths, appears to\nbehave in a resistive manner.L8\xc2\xbb*<10J Previous calculations of\n.\nneutralizer plasmas showed that, at least for regions of .several\ncentimeters from the cathode orifice, the plasma properties and electron\ncurrent flow patterns conformed to a f l u i d model of electron transport.\nThe basic elements of the model are the steady state ion\ncontinuity and momentum equations\n\nV \xe2\x80\xa2 nV = 0\n\n(1)\n\nM\n\n(\xc2\xab\n\ndT - elE * TJ - -T\n\nwhere n = n(r) is density of ions of mass M at the position r and v1\ntheir mean velocity.

If the\nplasma is not c o l l i s i o n dominated, randomization of electron velocities\nmay s t i l l occur through enhanced levels of fluctuating electric fields,\nsuch as occur in the unstable passage of electron streams through the\nplasma. These mechanisms are effective in coupling hollow cathode\nelectrons into the plasma at effective col I is ion frequencies that may be\nalmost as large as the plasma frequency.\'- -I When augmented by an energy\nbalance equation, two-dimensional calculations predict temperatures and\npotentials in reasonable agreement with ion engine neutralization data\nobtained both in the laboratory and in space.\n\n506\n\nThis theory for electron transport can be applied in simplified\nform to electron emission to the space plasma.

To collect a strongly enhanced current the potential on\nthe sphere must be much larger than the plasma temperature, i.e.,\ne^ \xc2\xbb 9. The current voltage characteristic of such a configuration is\nwell described by the theory of Langmuir and Blodgett.\nMost descriptions of the passive collection of electrons by the\ntethered satellite are based upon space charge limited sheath theory\nwith some modifications due to magnetic field and presheath effects.\'-I The theory presented here addresses the changes in the\npotential structure that occur when a plasma is generated in the\nv i c i n i t y of the sphere. This theory omits the effect of a magnetic\nfield, an omission not totally justified, especially in regions where\nthe electron cyclotron frequency is comparable to or greater than the\nlocal plasma frequency.\nThere is l i t t l e data on the use of hollow cathode plasma sources\nto enhance electron collection. Theoretical considerations, however,\nsupport what limited data there is: the effective impedance of an\nelectron collecting probe is greatly reduced by copious emission of\nplasma. Even though the theory is incomplete, it identifies the regimes\nof impedance reduction and defines values of the plasma generation rate\nwhich w i l l produce substantial changes in the impedance. Increasing the\nplasma generation rate, Ip, first reduces the voltage drop across the\nspace charge limited collection sheath, further increases collapse the\nspace charge sheath, and, when the ion generation rate is increased\nbeyond the electron collection rate Ie, current is transported by the\nions.\n\n509\n\nIn fact the different regimes of current collection may be\ncategorized according to the following inequalities between ion\ngeneration rate I- and electron collection rate Ie:\nRegime I:\n\nRegime II:\n\nRegime III:\n\nV1.\nEach of these regimes is considered below. For convenience, the\ncollecting sphere is assumed to operate at a constant current.\nReg i me I.\n\nFor a n u l l ion generation rate, current collection (B = 0) is well\nunderstood and requires large voltages to extract current much in excess\nof the geometrical limit. The effect of generating a small amount of\nplasma at the sphere is approximately equivalent to emitting ions from\nthe anode of a diode. The effect of the electrons created in the\nionization process can be ignored if the rate of plasma production is\nmuch less than the collected electron current. The plasma ions stream\nout across the sheath, cancelling a portion of the electron space\ncharge. For planar diodes it has been shown I J that the maximum ion\ncurrent density that the sheath can extract is related to.the electron\ncurrent density by\n\n510\n\n(14)\n\nThis relation, known as the "Langmuir condition", is also the basic\nstability condition for a strong plasma double layer. At this ion\ncurrent, the voltage required to sustain a fixed electron current is\nreduced by one-third. For nonplanar geometries this current ratio can\nbe exceeded by factors of order two. The resulting small reduction in\nsheath voltage is of little importance compared with the dramatic change\nthat occurs when the plasma generation rate increases beyond the jj of\nthe double layer stability condition which separates regimes I and II.\nRegime II.\nRecent calculations of the effect of ionization in electron\ncollecting sheaths.have shown that when the "Langmuir condition" ion\ncurrent is exceeded, the generated plasma remains quasi neutral and the\nions expand hydrodynamically.I J In the l i m i t of the plasma generation\nrate large compared with the "Langmuir condition" ion current, and\nassuming constant temperature, the potential profile can be described by\nthe Boltzmann law, Eq. (5). The ion density is determined by the selfconsistent motion in the quasi neutral field. The resultant description\nof the potentials and densities is the same as that for hollow cathode\nneutralizers used as electron emitters. What is not certain is the\nmagnitude of the electron transport coefficients. The model described\nin the previous section for electron emission can serve as a first\nestimate of electron collection from the ambient plasma. From Eq. (13)\nthe collection area enhancement possible w h i l e maintaining isothermal\nquasineutraIity can be obtained by substituting for the total current in\n\n511\n\nterms of the ambient thermal current times an. effect!ve col lection area,\n\ni.e.,\nI = J0 4\xc2\xbbR2.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n(15)\n\nFor a collector radius, a, of one meter, this estimated collector area\nexceeds the geometric area by the factor\n\n.\n2\n\n2n\n\na " a amb\nTaking r\n\no\n\n=1 cm. and n /n , = 10\no aiDD\n\nR2\n% = 100\n\nFurther study is necessary to determine the accuracy of this collection\narea enhancement.\nThe plasma generation rate required to sustain this lower\nimpedance mode of electron collection can be estimated as follows. At\nthe effective collection radius R defined by Eq. (15), the ion current\nfrom the plasma source is\nI. = 4rR2j. = 4*R2n.V.,\nJ\ni\ni\nii\nand since n. - n , where n\n\nis the ambient density\n\nI. = 4rR2neVj = Ie j-\n\n512\n\nwhere Ve is the thermal speed of ambient electrons and V; is the speed\nof source ions at the effective collection radius R. As indicated\nschematically in Figure 3, the net movement of ions is down the\npotential h i l l separating the collector from the ambient plasma.\n\nIons roll down potential\nand obtain velocity\nPotential\n\nlectrons from plasma\nare sucked up the\npotential\n\nRad ius\n\nFigure 3. Potential profile around the plasma source.\nNeglecting the effect of drag, ions starting from rest would attain the\nmaximum velocity (2e 0c/i"j) \' , so that\n\nand the bound on the required ion current varies only as the square root\nof the potential. From Eq. (12) and the discussion following it,\nelectron currents near one ampere would correspond to potentials ^_ -10\nvolts. For an argon plasma, with Vm j /me -300, and for 6 -0.1 eV\n\n513\n\nJ\nP\n\n< 38\n\nRegime III.\nFor plasma generation rates in excess of the collected currents\nthe net electron current is outward from the subsatelIite. In this case\nthe ions transport the current and the effective mobility of the\nelectrons plays little role in determining the plasma potential,\nprovided that the current does not exceed the net rate of escape of ions\n1} from the vicinity of the collector. Thus, assuming f u l l ionization\nof the neutral gas flow through the cathode, the required mass flow rate\nfor ion transport is\n\n- >\xc2\xb05 X\nwhere m is the mass flow rate in grams/sec of atoms of atomic weight A\nand m^ is the proton mass. Of course, if the cathode does not float\nwith respect to the collector, the total current through the cathode may\nexceed Ij, but any current through the cathode-collector-plasma loop\ndoes not flow through the tether. It is useful to observe that I- - 1\nampere corresponds to a flow rate slightly less than A grams per day.\nSince high ionization efficiencies are achievable with hollow cathode\nsources operating in their spot modes it is u n l i k e l y that such flow\nrates for the duration of TSS-1 would significantly impact the satellite\nmass.\n\n514\n\nCONCLUSION\nFor both the electron emitting and electron collecting ends of the\ntethered satellite system, locally generated plasmas eliminate the space\ncharge sheath. The high voltages necessary to transport charge across a\nspace charge sheath makes the sheath regions the highest impedance\nportions of the tether system. Reducing this impedance by local plasma\nsources, such as hollow cathodes, w i l l greatly enhance the effectiveness\nof a tethered satellite system. W h i l e parts of the theory are not yet\nf u l l y developed and magnetic fields have not been included, the theory\ndoes provide a framework for understanding how currents flow through the\nlocally generated plasmas. The theory predicts the impedance for\nelectron emission from the orbiter as a function of plasma generation\nrate, Ip|asma; tether current, Itether\' an<^ ambient plasma density.
