b'THE-LIXISCOPE\nA. THE LiXISCOPE CONCEPT\nDr. Lo i Yin\nLaboratory for Astronomy and Solar Physics\nGoddard Space Flight Center\n\nThe principle of the Lixiscope is extremely simple.\n(Figure 1) It is based on a modular approach toward\nX-ray imaging where the three major components are\nphysically independent entities, and therefore easily\nreplaceable and interchangeable. The three major\ncomponents are: the X-ray source, the converter\nphosphor or scintillator, and the microchannel plate\nvisible-light image intensifier. The X-ray image of an\nobject formed by the X-ray source falls onto the\nconverter phosphor or scintillator which converts\nthe X-ray image into a visible-light image. This\nvisible-light image is then intensified by a factor of\n1 0 5 or more by a high-gain microchannel plate\nvisible-light image intensifier whose output ca/n be\nviewed directly, photographed, or coupled to other\nimaging devices. Because of the high gain of the\nmicrochannel plate image intensifier, it is possible i n\nPHOTON\nGAIN\n\nSClNTILLhTOR\n\nPHOTON\nTO\nELECTRON\nCONVERSION\n\nsome applications to use a radioactive source instead\nof an X-ray machine. In this manner, the whole X-ray\nimaging device becomes completely portable.\nIn the Lixiscope prototype, a "point" radioactive\nsource is inside a shielded source holder. (Figure 2)A\nfinger-controlled mechanism unshields the source to\ncollimate the radiation onto a converter phosphor\nwhich is shielded from ambient light, but is optically\ncoupled to the night vision image intensifier. Because\nof the source collimation and two layers of lead glass\ni n the intensifier, no significant radiation above\nnatural background reaches the viewer. The Lixiscope is powered by a single 2.7 volt battery i n the\nhandle.\nSince its inception, there has been a large interest\ni n the Lixiscope. Because of its small size and portability, there are many potential medical and\n\nELECTRON\nGAIN\n\nELECTRON\nTO\nPHOTON\nCONVERSION\n\nMICROCHANNEL PLATE\n\nPHOTOCATHODE\n\nFigure 1 .\n\nOUTPUT\nPHOSPHOR\n\nPrinciple of the Lixiscope\n\nFigure 2. The Lixiscope Prototype\nindustrial applications. During the past year, experts in\nsome areas of medicine and medical physics have, on\na rather limited scale, tested the prototype Lixiscope.\nThe preliminary impressions and evaluations of the\npotential applicability, advantages, limitations, as\nwell as shortcomings of the Lixiscope i n the respective fields are described in this report. There have not\nbeen any formal large-scale clinical evaluations of\nthe Lixiscope. This conference can be considered only\nas an initial effort i n this direction.\nTo put the Lixiscope in its proper perspective, the\nfollowing characteristics should be considered.\n1. The Lixiscope is a small-sized, fully portable\nfluoroscope.1-4 As such, its most promising\napplications are likely to be in those situations\nwhere large size is not important but portability\nis, such as where electricity is not available or\nwhere easy maneuverability is necessary.\nTherefore, it will not replace or duplicate the\n\nfunctions of existing X-ray imaging devices,\nwhich are large-sized and non-portable. There\nare areas of overlap where the Lixiscope can\nserve as a complement to the larger instrument.\nWhen performance characteristics such as image quality and dose rates associated with the\nLixiscope are considered, one should take into\naccount the specific manner i n which it is to be\nused. In this regard, publications may have been\nmisconstrued by implying that the Lixiscope is\nthe only low-dose imaging device, or that it can\nachieve dosage reductions of 1 0 3 times i n all\napplications. This is not the case. There are\nother existing devices and methods which have\nequal performance characteristics at low-dose\nlevels comparable to the Lixiscope. However, i n\nfluoroscopy, the Lixiscope not only achieves\nthese performance characteristics simply and\nefficiently, but also in an extremely compact,\nrugged, and fully portable manner. Small, portable fluoroscopy is the most important characteristic of the Lixiscope.\nBecause the Lixiscope is essentially a fluoroscopic device for real-time X-ray imaging, the\nbest way to Dresant the real-time images\n;\nwould b i n the\'form of a movie or a video tape.\nHowever, i n the accompanying photos, the\nfluoroscopic images were recorded on instantprocessing film. As such, they are not direct Xray radiographs, and should not be compared\nwith the resolution and quality of X-ray\nradiographs.\n4. The prototype Lixiscopes used for these\nevaluations were constructed entirely from offthe-shelf items. No effort was made to optimize\ntheir performance for a given application.\n\nReferences\n1. L.
