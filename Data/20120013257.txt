b'Software\nAerosol and Surface\nParameter Retrievals for\na Multi-Angle, Multiband\nSpectrometer\nThis software retrieves the surface and\natmosphere parameters of multi-angle,\nmultiband spectra. The synthetic spectra\nare generated by applying the modified\nRahman-Pinty-Verstraete Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF)\nmodel, and a single-scattering dominated\natmosphere model to surface reflectance\ndata from Multiangle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR). The aerosol physical\nmodel uses a single scattering approximation using Rayleigh scattering molecules,\nand Henyey-Greenstein aerosols. The surface and atmosphere parameters of the\nmodels are retrieved using the LavenbergMarquardt algorithm.\nThe software can retrieve the surface\nand atmosphere parameters with two\ndifferent scales. The surface parameters\nare retrieved pixel-by-pixel while the atmosphere parameters are retrieved for a\ngroup of pixels where the same atmosphere model parameters are applied.\nThis two-scale approach allows one to select the natural scale of the atmosphere\nproperties relative to surface properties.\nThe software also takes advantage of an\nintelligent initial condition given by the\nsolution of the neighbor pixels.\nThis work was done by Seungwon Lee,\nRachel A. Hodos, and Paul A. Von Allmen of\nCaltech for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\nFurther information is contained in a TSP\n(see page 1).\nThis software is available for commercial licensing.

The intended use is for\noffline post-processing of such logs, after\nthe execution of the system under test.\nLogScope can, however, in principle,\nalso be used to monitor systems online\nduring their execution. Logs are\nchecked against requirements formulated as monitors expressed in a rulebased specification language. This language has similarities to a state machine\nlanguage, but is more expressive, for ex-\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 2012\n\nample, in its handling of data parameters. The specification language is\nuser friendly, simple, and yet expressive\nenough for many practical scenarios.\nThe LogScope software was initially\ndeveloped to specifically assist in testing\nJPL\xe2\x80\x99s Mars Science Laboratory (MSL)\nflight software, but it is very generic in\nnature and can be applied to any application that produces some form of logging information (which almost any software does).\nThis work was done by Klaus Havelund\nand Margaret H. Smith of Caltech; Howard\nBarringer of University of Manchester, UK;\nand Alex Groce of Oregon State University for\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

A trace is a sequence of events, and\ncan, for example, be generated by a running program, instrumented appropriately to generate events. An event can be\nany data object. An example of a trace is\na log file containing events that a programmer has found important to record\nduring a program execution. TraceContract takes as input such a trace together with a specification formulated\nusing the API and reports on any violations of the specification, potentially\ncalling code (reactions) to be executed\nwhen violations are detected.\nThe software is developed as an internal\nDSL (Domain Specific Language) in the\nScala programming language. Scala is a\nrelatively new programming language that\nis specifically convenient for defining such\ninternal DSLs due to a number of language characteristics. This includes Scala\xe2\x80\x99s\nelegant combination of object-oriented\nand functional programming, a succinct\nnotation, and an advanced type system.\nThe DSL offers a combination of data-parameterized state machines and temporal\nlogic, which is novel. As an extension of\nScala, it is a very expressive and convenient\nlog file analysis framework.\nThis work was done by Klaus Havelund of\nCaltech and Howard Barringer of University\n\nof Manchester, UK, for NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion\nLaboratory.

It automatically generates daily and multi-day averaged colorized and annotated maps of\nvarious AIRS Level 2 swath geophysical\nparameters. It also generates AIRS input\ndata sets for Eyes on Earth, Puffersphere, and Magic Planet.\nThis program is tailored to AIRS Level\n2 data products. It re-projects data into\n1/4-degree grids that can be combined\nand averaged for any number of days.\nThe software scales and colorizes global\ngrids utilizing AIRS-specific color tables,\nand annotates images with title and\ncolor bar.\nThis software can be tailored for use\nwith other swath data products for the\npurposes of visualization.\nThis work was done by Charles K. Thompson and Stephen J. Licata of Caltech for\nNASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. For more information, contact iaoffice@jpl.nasa.gov.\nThis software is available for commercial licensing.

In addition, small\nhigh-speed boats run the risk of diving\nwith the bow into the next wave crest\nduring operations in the wavelengths\nand wave speeds that are typical for\nshallow water. In order to mitigate the\nissues of autonomous navigation in\nrough water, a hybrid controller called\n\n23\n\nPOSTMAN combines the concept of\nPOS (point of sail) tack planning from\nthe sailing domain with a standard PID\n(proportional-integral-derivative) controller that implements reliable target\nreaching for the motorized small boat\ncontrol task.\nThis is an embedded, adaptive software controller that uses look-ahead\nsensing in a closed loop method to perform path planning for safer navigation\nin rough waters. State-of-the-art controllers for small boats are based on\ncomplex models of the vessel\xe2\x80\x99s kinematics and dynamics. They enable the vessel to follow preplanned paths accurately and can theoretically control all\nof the small boat\xe2\x80\x99s six degrees of free-\n\n24\n\ndom. However, the problems of bow\ndiving and other undesirable incidents\nare not addressed, and it is questionable if a six-DOF controller with basically a single actuator is possible at all.\nPOSTMAN builds an adaptive capability into the controller based on sensed\nwave characteristics.\nThis software will bring a muchneeded capability to unmanned small\nboats moving at high speeds. Previously,\nthis class of boat was limited to wave\nheights of less than one meter in the sea\nstates in which it could operate. POSTMAN is a major advance in autonomous\nsafety for small maritime craft.\nThis work was done by Terrance L. Huntsberger of Caltech and Felix Reinhart of the Re-\n\nsearch Institute for Cognition and Robotics\nfor NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
