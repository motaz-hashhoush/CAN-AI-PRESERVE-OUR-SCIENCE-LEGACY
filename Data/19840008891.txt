An ion\naccelerator system which is commonly used includes an\nextraction grid or electrode with a narrow slit for extracting\na slit-like ion beam, followed by accelerator and\n15 decelerator electrodes, and with a potential of many kilovolts\nbetween the extraction and accelerator electrodes to produce\nan accelerated ion beam. Experience has shown that such\naccelerator systems are limited in beam intensity and\nfocusing, which results in excessively long\n\nimplantation\n\n20 process times in many applications. An ion beam accelerator\nsystem which could produce higher beam current densities\nwith high efficiency and good collimation, would be of value\nin ion implantation applications, as well as other applications\nwhich utilize ion beams.\n25 SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\nIn accordance with one embodiment of the present\n\ninvention, an ion beam accelerator system is provided, for\nextracting and accelerating ions from a source to produce an\nion beam of high current density. The system includes a\n30 pair of slightly spaced extraction grids with convex faces\nfacing towards an ion source, and with the grids having\naligned pairs of holes for extracting ion beamlets. The pairs\nof holes are positioned so that the beamlets converge, to\n\n\t\n\n.._\n81/124\n- 2 enable them to converge into a single beam. The extraction\ngrids are closely spaced and maintained at only a moderate\nvoltage between them, to only moderately accelerate the\nbeamlets. The grids are followed by an accelerator electrode\n5 device, including an electrode with a hole large enough to\npass the merged beamlets and which is at a much lower potential\nthan the grids, for energetically accelerating the ions.\nThe novel features of the invention are set forth\nwith particularity in the appended claims. The invention will\nI n be best understood from the following description when read\nin conjunction with the accompanying drawings.\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS\nFigure 1 is a partial sectional view of an\nion beam accelerator system constructed in accordance with\n15 the present invention.\nFigure 2 is a partial perspective view of the\nsystem of Figure 1.\nFigure 3 is a partial perspective view of another\nion beam accelerator system.\nFigure 4 is a partial perspective view of another\n20\t\nic:i beam accelerator system.\nDESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS\nFigures 1 and 2 illustrate an ion beam accelerator\nsystem 10 which can be utilized to extract ions from an ion\n25 source 12 and acceleratre the extracted ions to form an ion\nbeam 14 of high beam current density that is suitable for\na variety of processes, particularly in ion implantation\napplications. A variety of well-known ion source devices are\navailable to produce the ion source 12. One such apparatus\n30 includes a hollow cathode through which the gas to be ionized\npasses, and with e_ectrons being emitted from an end of the\ncathode towards an anode to ionize gas emerging from the\nhollow electrode, to provide the ions to be formed into a\nbeam by the present system.\n\nQ\n\n7\ner\n81/124\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n- 3 The accelerator system 10 includes a pair of\nextraction grids 16, 18 which efficiently extract ions from\nthe source 12 to form beamlets 20 of ions accelerated to a\nlow to moderate energy. The system also includes an\naccelerator electrode device 22 having a pair of electrodes\n24, 26 that acclerate the combined beamlets to a high energy\nlevel.\nThe two extraction grids 16, 18 are formed with\nnumerous small holes 28, 30 through which narrow beams or\nbeamlets of ions can pass. The downstream or focusing\ngrid 18 is maintained at a negative potential such as a few\nhundred volts below the upstream or screen grid 16, so that\nions from the source 12 pass through the grid 16 by\nattraction to the potential within the holes of the second\ngrid 18. However, the moderate voltage difference accelerates\nthe beamlets 20 to only a relatively low energy level. The\nion flow, or current, of each beamlet 20 is relatively low,\nand higher densities are achieved by merging the beamlets 20\ninto the single beam 14. This is accomplished by curving\nthe grids 16, 18, and positioning their respective\nholes 28, 30 so that a pair of corresponding holes in the\ntwo grids are aligned in a direction to from a group of\nconverging beamlets. This can be accomplished by aligning\nthe holes such as 28, 30 so that a beamlet path 32 passing\nthrough the two holes reaches a common focus 36, for all of\nthe corresponding pairs of holes in the extraction grids.\nIn the accelerator electrode device 22, the upstream\nelectrode 24 is maintained at a large negative potential\nwith respect to the extraction grids 16, 18, to create a\npotential within the hole 34 of the electrode that\naccelerates the beamlets and combined beam to a high energy.\nThe downstream electrode 26, which may be referred to as a\ndeceleration electrode because it is at a positive potential\nwith respect to the accelerating electrode 24, is used to\nprovide a grounded ion beam. Such grounding minimizes\n\n-4\ng\n\nt\n\n\t\n\n81/124\n\n- 4 defocusing of the beam 14, because it brings all portions\nof the ion beam 14 to ground potential uniformly. The\nnegative potential of the accelerator electrode 24 is utilized\nto prevent backward or upstream flow of electrons that\n\t\n\nare created when the ion beam 14 strikes a workpiece.\n\n5\n\nFigure 1 shows how the various voltages of the\nparts of the system can be established, as by utilizing a\nhigh voltage source 40 such as of 17,001 volts that maintains\nthe screen grid 1G at a large potential above ground to\n10\n\n\t\n\nprovide a large voltage drop for accelerating the ion beam.\nAnother voltage source 42 maintians the focusing grid 18 at\na moderate voltage such as 550 volts below the screen grid\n16. A third voltage source 44 maintains the accelerator\ngrid electrode 24 at a ::egative voltage with respect to the\n\n15\n\n\t\n\nground potential of the deceleration electrode 26.\nThe width W of the extraction grids, such as the\nscreen grid 16, should not be more than about one centimeter\n(i.e. less than two centimeters) or else large backstreaming\nof electrons from the beam plasma to the extraction grids\n\n20\n\n\t\n\ncan occur (in the presence of the acclerator electrode 24\nwhich is at a much lower potential). Accordingly, the\nwidth of the ion beam 14 obtained from the device is\nlimited, as to a 1/e width (i.e. where ion density is at\n0.37 of the density at the center of the beam) of about one-\n\n25\n\n\t\n\nhalf centimeter. To achieve a considerable beam current,\nthe extraction grids 16, 18 are constructed, as shown\nin Figure 2, with a height H much greater than their width W,\nsuch as 5 times as great. This produces a slit-shaped beam 14.\n\n30\n\n\t\n\nIt is found that the resulting beam 14 is well collimated both\nin height and width.\nThe extraction efficiency of the extraction grids 16,\n3.8 is enhanced by utilizing grids which are very thin and\nmaintained very close together. Thin grids, and especially\na thin screen grid 16, increases the efficiency with which ions\n\n35\n\n\t\n\nare extracted from the ion plasma source 12, since a thin screen\n\n81/124\n- 5 grid reduces ion recombination losses on the walls of the\ngrid holes 28. It is desirable to maintain the grids 16, 18\nas close together as practical to maximize the ion field\ncurrent. The extracted ion current density increases\n5\n\nas a function of y Z`\ngrids and S is\t\n\n, where V is the voltage between the\n\n5 the separation between the grids.\n\nSince the maximum voltage that can be applied before there\nis arcing, is proportional to the grid separation, it can\nbe seen that the extracted ion current density increases\n10\n\nas the extraction grid separation S decreases (assuming that\nthe voltage is adjusted so the electric field between the\ngrids is maintained at a constant value).\nIn one ion accelerator that has been constructed,\nboth of the extraction grids 16, 18, were formed of graphite,\n\n15\n\nwhich is useful to stand up to the high temperatures such as\n1,000\xc2\xb0F to which the grids are subjected. The screen grid\n16 had a thickness A of 18 mil (one mil equals .001 inch), the\nfocusing grid 18 had a thickness B of 22 mil, and the grids\nwere separated by a distance S of 60 mil as measured along\n\n20\n\nthe beam centerline 50. Each of the holes 28, 30 in the\ngrids were drilled to a diameter of 82 mil, and the centerlines\nof the holes in each grid were spaced by about 100 mil. The\nholes were formed in staggered rows with four or five holes\nin each row, to form a hexagonal pattern wherein each hole\n\n25\n\n(except those at the edges) is equally spaced from six\nadjacent holes. The distance C between the extraction grids\nand the accelerator electrode device, as measured along\nthe beam centerline 50, was 0.6 inch. The accelerator grid\n24 had a thickness D of 0.31 inch and a hole width E of\n\n30\n\n0.375\n\ninch. The deceleration electrode 26 had a thickness\n\nF of 0.24 inch and a hole width G of 0.50 inch. Both of the\nholes 34, 52 in the electrodes had a height of 1 3/8 inches,\nwhich is slightly greater than the heigch of the matrix of\nholes in the extraction grids. The apparatus was fed with\n35\n\nt\nXenon gas at a rate of 0.35 standard cubic centimeters per\n\n\t\n\nC\n81/124\n\n- 6 minute into the ion beam plasma source 12 and there was\nalmost 100% extraction of the ions into the beam 14.\nIon beams were produced having a centerline density of\nover 500 A/ cm2 and a beam divergence of less than one\n\t\n\ndegree.\n\n5\n\nIn constructing and testing the accelerator\nsystem 10, it was found that care must be taken in designing\nthe geometry of the extraction grid apparatus and the voltages\napplied between the grids, to assure that the beamlets 20\n10\n\n\t\n\nmerge into a single beam. If the ion current in each\nbeamlet 20 is too small,\n\nthen the\n\nbeamlets 20 will pass across\n\none another instead of merging into a single beam 14. On\nthe other hand, if the beamlet currents are too large, then\nthe combined beamle S form a beam that fans out or\n15\n\n\t\n\ndiverges at a large angle. The moderate voltage such as\n550 volts between closely spaced extraction grids, and the\nsize of the holes such as 28 in the screen grid, provide\nbeamlets that merge, while allowing a large voltage drop\nto the accelerator electrode device 22 to further accelerate\n\n20\n\n\t\n\nthe beam.\nAlthough the single slit-sh ed ion beam 14\nproduced by the above-described system is useful in\nmany applications, it is often desirable to provide a\ncollimated beam of much greater current. This can be\n\n25\n\n\t\n\naccomplished, as by the apparatus of Figure 3, wherein\nthe beams 14 from several of the ion beam accelerator\nsystem, of the type shown in Figure 1 can be combined\ninto one higher current beam 60. This can be accomplished\t\ns\n\nby utilizing a pair of electrostatic beam deflection\n30\n\n\t35\n\n\t\n\nplates 62, 64 on either side of each beam 14 as it emerges\nfrom its corresponding decelerator electrode such as 66\nwhich is similar to the electrode 26 of Figure 1. The\ndeflection plates 62, 64 are maintained at different`;\'.\n,;oltages to deflect the ion beam 14 to one side, to merge\n\n\t\n\nf.\n\nwith the other ion beams. In another merging apparatus,\n\n\t\n\n81/124\n\n7\nof which part is shown in Figure 4, the decceleration\nelectrode 67 near the downstream end of each ion beam\naccelerator can be split in half, with the two halves\n68, 70 separated by an insulation 72. Such an electrode\n5\t\n\nis utilized in place of the accelerator electrode 24\nin Figure 1. The twc; halves 68, 70 are maintained at a\ndifferent voltage, as by maintaining the half 68 at minus\n300 volts and the other half 70 at minus 300 volts, with\nrespect to the grounded decelerator electrode (not shown,\n\n10\t\n\nand therefore serve to electrostatically deflect the ion\nbeam. A group of ion beam accelerators can be set up so\nthey are positioned beside one another as in Figure 3,\nto merge the group of beams 14 into one higher current\nbeam.\n\n15\t\n\nThus, the invention provides an ion beam accelerator\nsystem which efficiently extracts and accelerates ions;\nto produce an ion beam of high current density, high\ntotal current, and good collimation. This is accomplished\nby utilizing a pair of extraction grids which are closely\n\n20\t\n\nspaced and at a moderate potential difference to extract\nion beamlets, and with the grids having pairs of holes\naligned so that the beamlets merge. The extraction\ngrids are both held at a high potential above ground,\nso that the beam rormed by the combined beamlets can be\n\n25\t\n\naccelerated to a high voltage by an accelerator electrode\ndevice. The beam formed by the combined beamlets, can, \t\n\n4\n\nin turn, be combined with other beams to form a large ion\nbeam current by sidewardly deflecting a group of\nslit-shaped beams.\n30\t\n\n\t35\t\n\nAlthough particular embodiments of the invention \t\n\n3\n\nhave been described and illustrated herein, it is recognized\nthat modifications and variations may readily occur to \t\n\ni\n\nthose skilled in the art and consequently, it is intended\nthat the claims be interpreted to cover such modifications\n3\n\nand equivalents.\n\nWMMNPMR\n\nGy\n91/124\nJPL-15547\nCIT-1677\nION BEAM ACCELERATOR SYSTEM\nABSTRACT OF THE DISCLOSURE\nA system is described that combines geometrical\nand electrostatic focusing to provide high ion extraction\nefficiency and good focusing of an accelerated ion beam.\nThe apparatus includes a pair of curved extraction\ngrids (16, 18) with multiple p=airs of aligned holes\npositioned to direct a group of beamlets (20) along\nconvezging paths.
