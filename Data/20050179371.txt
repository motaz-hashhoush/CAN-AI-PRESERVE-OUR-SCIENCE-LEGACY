b'"Green" High-Temperature Polymers\nPMR-15 is a processable, high-temperature polymer developed at the NASA Lewis\nResearch Center in the 1970\'s principally for aeropropulsion applications. Use of fiberreinforced polymer matrix composites in these applications can lead to substantial weight\nsavings, thereby leading to improved fuel economy, increased passenger and payload\ncapacity, and better maneuverability. PMR-15 is used fairly extensively in military and\ncommercial aircraft engines components seeing service temperatures as high as 500 \xc2\xb0F\n(260 \xc2\xb0C), such as the outer bypass duct for the F-404 engine. The current world-wide\nmarket for PMR-15 materials (resins, adhesives, and composites) is on the order of $6 to\n10 million annually.\nPMR-15 is prepared with a monomer, methylenedianiline (MDA), which is a known\nanimal and suspect human carcinogen. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration\n(OSHA) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) heavily regulate the use of\nMDA in the workplace and require certain engineering controls be used whenever MDAcontaining materials (e.g., PMR-15) are being handled and processed. Implementation of\nthese safety measures for the handling and disposal of PMR-15 materials costs the aircraft\nengine manufacturing industry millions of dollars annually.\n\nSome candidate diamines for replacing MDA (top left) in PMR-15.\nUnder the Advanced Subsonic Technology (AST) Program, researchers at NASA Lewis,\nGeneral Electric, DuPont, Maverick Composites, and St. Norbert College have been\nworking to develop and identify replacements for PMR-15 that do not rely upon the use of\ncarcinogenic or mutagenic starting materials. This effort involves toxicological screening\n(Ames\' testing) of new monomers as well as an evaluation of the properties and hightemperature performance of polymers and composites prepared with these materials. A\nnumber of diamines have been screened for use in PMR-15 replacements. Three diamines,\nBAX, CO-BAX, and BAPP (see the preceding chemical illustration), passed the Ames\'\ntesting. Graphite-reinforced composites prepared with polyimides containing these\ndiamines were evaluated against a PMR-15 control in terms of their high-temperature\n\nstability (weight loss after 125 hr in air at 316 \xc2\xb0C and 5-atm pressure) and glass-transition\ntemperature (an indication of high-temperature mechanical performance). Of these three\nmaterials systems, both the BAX and CO-BAX composites had stabilities and glasstransition temperatures comparable to those of PMR-15 (see the graphs). Further\nevaluation of the processability of these materials as well as their long-term stability and\nmechanical performance at 288 \xc2\xb0C (550 \xc2\xb0F) is in progress.\n\nComparison of the glass-transition temperature and thermal-oxidative stability of\ngraphite-reinforced composites prepared with non-MDA PMR-15 replacements.
