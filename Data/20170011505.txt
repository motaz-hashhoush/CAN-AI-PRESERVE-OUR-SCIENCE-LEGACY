The core is doped with an active element.\nThe inner cladding layer surrounds the core, and has a\nrefractive index substantially equal to that of the core. The\nouter cladding layer surrounds the inner cladding layer, and\nhas a refractive index less than that of the core and inner\ncladding layer. The core length is about 30 to 2000 times the\ncore diameter. A hybrid fiber rod laser system includes an\noscillator laser, modulating device, the rod, and pump laser\ndiode(s) energizing the rod from opposite ends. The rod acts\nas a waveguide for pump radiation but allows for free-space\npropagation oflaser radiation. The rod may be used in a laser\nresonator. The core length is less than about twice the\nRayleigh range.

In accordance with 35 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7202, the\ncontractor elected not to retain title.\n\n15\n\n20\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n25\n\nLasers emit concentrated light via the optical amplification and stimulated emission of electromagnetic radiation,\nwhich in turn occurs through an application-specific laser\ngain medium. The light from ordinary light sources, such as\nthe sun or an incandescent light bulb, is spread over a broad\nband of wavelengths. In contrast, laser light is usually\ncontained within a very narrow wavelength band, and is\noften described as being monochromatic. Additionally, the\nlight is emitted in phase and thus is highly coherent. Laser\nlight beams are also collimated rather than spreading out in\nall directions in the manner of ordinary light. Because laser\nlight is monochromatic, coherent, and collimated, an emitted\nlaser beam may be used to irradiate a very small area and\nthus achieve very high power densities even with moderate\noverall power levels. Generally, single-mode/wavelength\nlasers have higher quality output with lower divergence,\nmore uniform spatial beam profile, and more pure spectral\ncontent than multi-mode/wavelength lasers. However, generating high peak power single-mode laser beams is significantly more challenging than generating multi mode laser\nbeams due to a number of non-linear effects occurring in the\nlaser gain media.\nA laser cavity or resonator lies at the heart of a laser\ndevice. A suitable laser gain medium such as a rare earth\nactive crystal, a gas, or a semiconductor material is enclosed\nand positioned along the optical axis of the resonator.\nMirrors may be disposed a distance apart from each other,\nwith one mirror being a total reflector and the other a partial\nreflector. As light reflects between the mirrors, the light\ngains in intensity with each reflected pass through the laser\ngain medium. Some light escapes through the partial reflector, also referred to as an output coupler, with the escaping\nlight forming the emitted laser beam that ultimately propagates along the optical axis.\nThe laser gain medium may be a solid, gas, or liquid, with\ncontinuous wave(CW)and pulsed lasers commonly used in\ncommercial and scientific research applications. CW lasers\nin particular produce an uninterrupted beam of light with a\nstable but relatively low peak output power. Pulsed lasers are\nable to sustain laser action over brief intervals, even down\nto pulse lengths of one nanosecond or less. Because pulsed\nlasers can release significant amounts of stored energy in\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\n55\n\n60\n\nthese pulses, each pulse can have a high peak power level\noften ranging from several kilowatts to multiple megawatts.\nIn contrast, the peak power of a CW single-mode laser is\nordinarily limited to no more than a few hundred watts.\nSolid-state lasers use laser gain material in the form of a\nsolid active matrix, such as a ruby crystal or another active\nelement, e.g., neodymium: yttrium-aluminum garnet\n("YAG"). Such lasers, while capable of outputting the high\npeak power levels noted above, are relatively inefficient and\nusually insufficiently coherent for performing certain precision tasks. A solid-state laser diode is an example of efficient, small,low-power laser devices which can be scaled to\nhigh power by combining them into compact multi-diode\npackages. While the divergence and coherence degrades as\nthe result of the combining, these devices have high utility\nas a pump sources to excite other laser gain media. The\nguiding ofpump beams at the cladding-to-cladding interface\nin the hybrid fiber rod is a means to mitigate the high\ndivergence of high power diode pump lasers. Another\nimportant type of laser is the fiber laser, with gain media\ncomposed of extended lengths of doped optical fiber. Conventional fiber lasers typically have fiber gain lengths of one\nor more meters, and core diameters on the order of less than\n10-20 microns for single-mode operation and around 100\nmicrons for multi-mode operation. Light passing along the\nextended fiber length is internally amplified and emitted in\nan efficient and highly coherent manner, but due to fiber\nstructural limitations posed by small core cross-sectional\narea and long lengths, the resulting high peak power densities of emitted light within the core limits the overall peak\npower to a correspondingly low level relative to solid-state\nlasers.\nThe most highly limiting process in fiber lasers is usually\nStimulated Brillouin Scattering (SBS), which can not only\nseverely degrade beam propagation, but can even produce\ncatastrophic material damage to the fiber. The threshold\npower (P,,sas) at which SBS reaches debilitating levels in\ndielectric materials, including optical fibers and hybrid fiber\nrods, scales with the quantity d2/L. Thus the small core\ndiameters(d)and long fiber lengths(L)ofconventional fiber\nlasers means that SBS becomes a threat at very low power\nthreshold levels. Much higher power levels can be reached\n(before SBS becomes a problem) with the larger core\ndiameters and shorter length gain media of the subject\nhybrid fiber rods.\nCurrently, there are many Earth-based and planetary mission-based measurements that cannot be performed due to\nsize, mass, power, and thermal concerns from the required\nlaser transmitter. Such missions include ASCENDS("Active\nSensing of CO2 Emissions over Nights, Days, and Seasons"), 3-D Winds missions studying tropospheric wind\nconditions using space-based laser systems, ozone detection\nmissions, EDL("Entry, Descent, and Landing") missions for\nthe exploration of Mars and other celestial bodies, Automatic Rendezvous and Docking, and space communications.\nSuch missions would benefit from an increase in available\nlaser efficiency and output power, along with corresponding\ndecreases in the mass and size of the laser device. There are\nalso many aircraft applications such as air data (air speed\nand direction) measurements and detection of clear air\nturbulence and wind shears that also require lasers of small\nsize. Therefore, there remains a need for a compact, low\nmass/high-energy laser system for use in the types of specialized applications noted above.\nBRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\n65\n\nA free-space hybrid fiber rod is disclosed herein for use in\nlaser applications of the types noted generally above. The\n\nUS 9,831,629 B2\n3\n\n4\n\nhybrid fiber rod combines the size, high peak power, and\nother advantages of solid-state lasers with the high efficiency\ncharacteristics of a fiber laser, and thus is described herein\nas a "hybrid" fiber rod. The present disclosure is intended as\na solution to the myriad challenges facing laser-based instrumentation for aviation, space, and other mission-based specialized applications that may be technically and programmatically challenging to implement due to size, power\nconsumption, complexity, and cost considerations.\nFor example, existing and proposed sensors employ laser\nspectrometers to measure parameters ofthe atmospheres and\nsurface ofthe Earth as well as surrounding planets and other\ncelestial bodies. The superior optical qualities of a laser\nbeam enables more accurate remote sensing measurements\nto be performed with higher resolutions and at greater\ndistances than is otherwise possible using active radar and\npassive optical instruments that lasers tend to replace. Many\napplications would benefit from increases in efficiency,\nreliability, and available laser power, with the corresponding\ndecrease in mass that is necessary to incorporate and operate\nsuch lasers on sensor platforms.\nThe present approach thus provides a novel hybrid fiber\nrod that may function as either a laser or a laser amplifier,\nwith an architecture that retains the high efficiency and beam\nquality of fiber lasers, but that also increases the pulse\nenergy and peak power output by up to two orders of\nmagnitude.Pulse energies are able to be increased from their\npresent levels of less than 100 microjoules, to over tens of\nmillijoules at a single frequency. Achieving the superb\nattributes of tunable laser beams at increasingly high power\nlevels, while meeting the stringent mass, power, and reliability for deployment to space and other operating environments, presents challenges that are not presently met by\nmany solid-state lasers. Hybrid fiber rod lasers may provide\nthe solution to those challenges.\nIn a particular embodiment, the hybrid fiber rod includes\na cylindrical silicate fiber core doped with an active element\nand having a first refractive index, which is determined by\nmaterial and wavelength requirements. The fiber rod also\nincludes inner and outer cladding layers coaxial with and\nsurrounding the fiber core. The inner cladding layer has a\nsecond refractive index that is substantially equal to the first\nrefractive index. The outer cladding layer, which is coaxial\nwith and surrounds the inner cladding layer, has a refractive\nindex that is less than the first and second refractive indexes.\nThe length ofthe fiber core may be about 30 to 2000 times\nlarger than the diameter of the fiber core in some embodiments. Where system requirements permit, the length of the\nfiber core/rod is kept relatively short, e.g., 0.1 m consistent\nwith the nonlinear power constraints described herein. However, for larger core diameters approaching 1000 \xc2\xb5m, hybrid\nfiber rod lengths could approach about 0.5 m.in all cases the\nlength of the fiber rod would be subject to the constraints\npresented herein.\nA hybrid fiber rod laser system is also disclosed. The\nsystem may include a master oscillator laser, a modulating\ndevice, the hybrid fiber rod noted above, and a pair of pump\nlaser diodes. The master oscillator laser is configured to\ngenerate an input laser beam along an optical axis. The\nmodulating device, which is positioned along the optical\naxis, is configured to receive and modulate a frequency,\nwavelength, or amplitude of the input laser beam, and\nthereby output a modulated laser beam. The pump laser\ndiodes are configured to energize the hybrid fiber rod from\nopposite ends of the fiber rod with a calibrated wavelength\nof light.\n\nAccording to another example embodiment, the hybrid\nfiber rod may include a silicate fiber core doped with an\nactive or rare-earth element in the form of, e.g., Neodymium, Erbium, or Holmium in three application-specific\nsingle-mode embodiments, with a doping concentration of\nabout 0.5 to 10 percent by weight ofthe fiber core. The fiber\ncore has a first refractive index, a length in this particular\nembodiment of between 0.03 meter (m) and 0.5 m, and a\ndiameter of between 100 micrometers (\xc2\xb5m) and 1000 \xc2\xb5m.\nThe fiber rod also includes an undoped inner cladding layer\narranged coaxially with and surrounding the fiber core, with\nthe inner cladding layer having an outer diameter of about\n130 to 170 percent of the diameter of the fiber core, and\nhaving a second refractive index that is substantially equal\nto the first refractive index. An outer cladding layer of the\nfiber rod is arranged coaxially with and surrounding the\ninner cladding layer. The outer cladding layer has a refractive index that is less than the first and second refractive\nindexes, e.g., no more than about 95 percent of the first and\nsecond refractive indexes.\nThese and other features, advantages, and objects of the\npresent disclosure will be further understood and appreciated by those skilled in the art by reference to the following\nspecification, claims, and appended drawings. The present\ndisclosure is susceptible to various modifications and alternative forms, and some representative embodiments have\nbeen shown by way of example in the drawings and will be\ndescribed in detail herein.

However, it is to be understood that various\nalternative orientations and step sequences may be envi-\n\nUS 9,831,629 B2\n5\n\n6\n\nsioned, except where expressly specified to the contrary.\nAlso for purposes of the present detailed description, words\nof approximation such as "about,""almost,""substantially,"\n"approximately," and the like, may be used herein in, the\nsense of "at, near, or nearly at," or "within 3-5% of," or\n"within acceptable manufacturing tolerances," or any logical\ncombination thereof. It is also to be understood that the\nspecific devices and processes illustrated in the attached\ndrawings, and described in the following specification, are\nexemplary embodiments ofthe inventive concepts defined in\nthe appended claims. Hence, specific dimensions and other\nphysical characteristics relating to the embodiments disclosed herein are not to be considered as limiting, unless the\nclaims expressly state otherwise.\nAs shown in FIG. 1, with the various Figures being\nschematic and not necessarily to scale in terms of size or\nrelative positioning unless specifically noted, a hybrid fiber\nrod 10 includes a fiber core 12, an inner cladding layer 14\nsurrounding the fiber core 12, and an outer cladding layer 16\nsurrounding the inner cladding layer 14. While shown as\ncylindrical in a typical configuration, the shape may be\nrectangular, hexagonal, or other suitable shapes in other\nembodiments. The hybrid fiber rod 10 has an optical axis 11,\nwith the fiber core 12, the inner cladding layer 14, and the\nouter cladding layer 16 being coaxially arranged with\nrespect to each other along the optical axis 11, such that the\nterms "inner" and "outer" respectively refer to closer and\nfarther relative proximity to the optical axis 11. When used\nin the example laser system 50 of FIGS. 2 and 3, the optical\naxis 11 serves as the axis of propagation of an emitted laser\nbeam, and thus forms a laser axis.\nThe fiber rod 10 has an axial length (L10 and a core\n)\ndiameter (d12). The length (L10 is substantially shorter and\n)\nthe core diameter (d12 is substantially larger than the\n)\nrespective length and core diameter of a conventional fiber\nlaser, with example dimensional ranges and size ratios set\nforth below. The fiber core 12 is doped with a wavelengthspecific active element and configured for use as a freespace laser gain medium. The present disclosure is thus\nintended to help overcome the problem of low optical\ndamage thresholds and nonlinear loss processes that occur in\nsingle-mode fiber lasers having conventional core diameters\non the order of 8 or 9 microns or micrometers (\xc2\xb5m) and\nlengths of over 1 m.\nThe use ofthe fiber core 12 of FIG.1 with its correspondingly large core diameter, which is on the order of 20-80\ntimes that of a conventional fiber core diameter, permits the\npeak power generated by the hybrid fiber rod 10 to be\nincreased by a factor of 10,000 or more, thus greatly\nexpanding the range of possible beneficial applications.\nMoreover, the degradation from single-mode to multi-mode\npropagation that ordinarily occurs in larger diameter conventional fiber lasers is avoided by limiting the length(L,,)\nto no more than twice the Rayleigh range as described\nbelow, which is typically less than 10 percent of the length\nof a conventional 1 m-long length offiber for a typical fiber\nlaser. Such extended lengths are needed in conventional\nfiber lasers in order to provide very high optical gains and\nhigh efficiency. Thus, the substantially smaller lengths and\nlarger core diameters set forth herein, are a notable departure\nfrom the construction of conventional fiber lasers and fiber\namplifiers.\nThe fiber core 12 may be constructed of a high-purity\nsilicate and doped with an application-suitable rare-earth\nactive element providing a desired wavelength. In a particular set of non-limiting embodiments in which a single-mode\nwavelength of 1 to 2\xc2\xb5m is desired, the active element may\n\nbe Neodymium for a wavelength of 1\xc2\xb5m, Erbium for a\nwavelength of 1.5 \xc2\xb5m, or Holmium for a wavelength of 2\n\xc2\xb5m, with typical doping concentrations of about 0.5 to 10\npercent by weight ofthe fiber core 12. Other rare earth active\nelements such as thulium or ytterbium may be envisioned in\nalternative embodiments without departing from the\nintended scope of the disclosure.\nThe inner cladding layer 14 of FIG. 1, which is coaxial\nwith and surrounds the fiber core 12, may be constructed of\na specialized silicate or other appropriate substrate material,\nwith a refractive index (n14) that is substantially equal to a\nrefractive index (n12 of the fiber core (12), i.e., n12-14 As\n)\nwill be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art, a\nrefractive index (or index of refraction) of a given medium\nis a unitless value calculated from the ratio of the speed of\nlight in a vacuum to that in the medium, i.e., the specific\nmaterials of the fiber core 12 and inner cladding layer 14 in\nthis instance. Ideally, the refractive indexes n12 and n14 are\nexactly equal. However, in practice the values are considered to be "substantially equal\'if n14 is greater than n12, in\norder to be non-guiding, but not more than 5 percent greater\nthan n121 in order to not produce substantial Fresnel reflection at the interface. The exact refractive index chosen for\nthe fiber core 12 and inner cladding layer 14 will depend on\nthe particular application.\nThe outer cladding layer 16, which may be constructed of\nsilica, is coaxial with and surrounds the inner cladding layer\n14, with the inner cladding layer 14 being immediately\nadjacent to the outer cladding layer 16 and sharing a\ncladding-to-cladding interface 40 as shown in FIG. 1A. The\nouter cladding layer 16 has a refractive index that is less than\nthat of each of the first and second refractive index, for\ninstance at least 6 to 8 percent less than the first and second\nrefractive indexes. The interface between the outer cladding\nlayer 16 and the inner cladding layer 14 acts as a waveguide,\nand thus the difference between a refractive index n16 and\nthe refractive index n141 or more precisely the difference in\nthe squares thereof, can be selected to tune the performance\nof the laser rod 10 for a given application. The outer\ncladding layer 16 also serves as a structural component\nconfigured to reinforce and protect the fiber core 12 and the\ninner cladding layer 14.\nA ratio of the length (L10 of the hybrid fiber rod 10 and\n)\nfiber core 12 to the diameter (d12 of the fiber core 12, i.e.,\n)\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n45\n\nLio\nd12\n\n50\n\n55\n\n60\n\n65\n\nmaybe in the range ofabout 30 to 1000, or within a narrower\nrange of30 to 300 in another embodiment. The fiber core 12\nis constructed within such ratio ranges to ensure a balance\nbetween the high relative efficiencies available via conventional fiber lasers and the high peak power levels associated\nwith solid-state lasers, with the dimensional parameters\nbeing such that damage to and non-linear effects within the\nfiber core 12 are largely avoided. The laser rod 10 of FIG.\n1 is thus treated as if it were a bulk solid-state laser, albeit\none in which pumped light is efficiently trapped, confined,\nand propagated within the fiber core 12 and the inner\ncladding layer 14, and along the optical axis 11.\nIn various embodiments, the fiber rod 10 may have a\nlength(L10 of less than about 0.1 meter(m)and a diameter\n)\n(d12 that is greater than about 100 \xc2\xb5m. For instance, the\n)\ndiameter (d12 of the fiber core 12 may be less than about\n)\n1000 \xc2\xb5m (1 mm), such as 0.5 mm in a particular configu-\n\nUS 9,831,629 B2\n7\n\n8\n\nration.

As is known\nhaving a Gaussian profile with low divergence. The beam\nin the art, modulating devices or modulators are configured\nradius varies along the propagation direction. Single-mode\n\nUS 9,831,629 B2\n9\n\n10\n\nbeams typically have beam profiles that are approximately\nGaussian. The presence of a strongly guiding interface to\ncapture and concentrate pump radiation places significant\nconstraints on the hybrid fiber rod 10 if the amplified laser\nbeams (arrow 23A) are to have free-space propagation 5\nproperties. The Rayleigh Range (LR of a Gaussian beam\n)\npropagating in free space is the distance from the narrowest\npart of the beam, i.e., the beam waist, from which point the\nradius of the beam grows due to diffraction to V1 times the\nbeam waist radius (wo). The Rayleigh Range(LR is given io\n)\nby:\n\nn7z\n\nLR =\n\nWo\nL\n\nwhere n is the refractive index of the fiber core 12, X is the\nvacuum wavelength, and wo is the beam waist radius. In\norder for the hybrid fiber rod 10 of FIG. 1 to not guide the\namplified beam (arrow 23A),the beam must not be reflected\nat the interface between claddings, and thus must not have\nsignificant intensity near the high-NA interface. This puts a\nconstraint on LR,and thus wo and d12(diameter of the fiber\ncore 12), for a given length of hybrid fiber rod 10.\nCorrespondingly, for a given core diameter d12, the\nrequirement of having low intensity at the cladding-tocladding interface 42 places a constraint on the length of the\nrod 10, namely ifthe Gaussian beam waist is placed halfway\nthrough the length Ll then L10 must be less than or on the\n,\norder of 2LR. If instead the beam waist is at one end of the\nrod 10, then L10 must be less than LR. Thus, for an embodiment where X-1.6 \xc2\xb5m, n=1.6, and wod12/2, then LR=27tx\n106wo2. For a 300 \xc2\xb5m diameter core (and 300 \xc2\xb5m beam\ndiameter two in the center ofL10), this gives LR0.07 m,and\nthus Llo<0.14 m. A conservative approach to avoiding high\nbeam intensities near the cladding-to-cladding interface 42\nmight be to consider keeping the rod length at about 0.1 m.\nIn the hybrid fiber rod 10,the value LR is generally greater\nthan (or at most equal to) half the length (L,,) of the hybrid\nfiber rod 10, i.e.,\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n4o\n\n2,\n\nLR >_ L\n\n45\n\nso that the beam being amplified propagates all the way\nthrough the rod 10 before the wings of the beam profile\nencounter the cladding-to-cladding surface 42 that is guiding\nthe pump beam. In conventional fiber amplifiers, with beam\nsingle-mode diameters the order of 10 \xc2\xb5m, the value of the\nfree-space equivalent LR of a mode this size would be less\nthan 1 mm, while fiber lengths are the order of one or more\nmeters. Thus, the beam, which would otherwise expand, is\ncontinually reflected by the core-to-cladding interface 40,\nand only guided propagation can take place over the fiber\nlength Ll,\nFor maximum gain and efficiency in the hybrid fiber rod\n10,the value ofthe beam waist diameter(two must be close\n)\nto the diameter(d12 ofthe fiber core 12 shown in FIG.1 for\n)\nhigh overlap of the laser beam with the gain medium.\nHowever,in order to remain a free-space single-mode beam,\nthe beam diameter must everywhere be significantly smaller\nthan the diameter ofthe cladding-to-cladding interface 42 of\nFIG. 1A, otherwise reflection at the interface of a portion of\nthe light in the wings of the Gaussian profile will introduce\ninterference fringes, and thus higher order mode content to\n\n5o\n\n55\n\n6o\n\n65\n\nthe remaining beam. For the higher numerical apertures at\ninterface 42 chosen to efficiently guide highly divergent\npump beams, these moderately divergent higher modes\nwould also be completely guided and amplified, and would\nremain within the beam. Thus, to minimize the contribution\nfrom this phenomena for fiber core lengths(L,,)on the order\nof the Rayleigh Range (LR), the intensity of the Gaussian\nprofile at the diameter d14 of the cladding-to-cladding interface 42 is made small by making the outer diameter\nd14>-1.5 d12.\nWith regard to the diameter ofthe outer cladding layer 16,\nthe actual diameter may vary with the application. The\nrefractive index difference determines the numerical aperture (NA),\nNA=\n\nnlaZ-ni6Z\n\nfor total internal reflection capture of divergent pump beams.\nBeyond that, the thickness helps smooth out any temperature\nhot spots due to cooling jacket asymmetries, and provides\nmechanical support to permit handling and mounting. A\nlarger diameter is stronger, and prevents pump power leakage by evanescent waves that could occur if the annulus\nlayer of the outer cladding layer 16 is too thin. However,the\ntemperature rise ofthe center ofthe fiber core 12,for a given\naverage heating power per unit length, scales as log(pc12/P,),\nwith pc12 being the radius of the outer cladding layer 16 and\np,being the radius of the inner cladding layer 14, and given\ngood thermal contact at the outer surface. Thus, a smaller\nouter diameter of the outer cladding layer 16 may be\nsomewhat better for high average power applications, especially if it is glass or some other poor thermal conductor.\nFIG. 3 depicts an example of a hybrid fiber rod laser\nsystem 150 in which the hybrid laser rod 10 ofFIG.1 is used\nas an amplifier device.
