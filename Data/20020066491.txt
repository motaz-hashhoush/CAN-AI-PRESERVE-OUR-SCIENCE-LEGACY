b'COMPUTER TECHNOLOGY\nCOMMERCIAL BENEFITS\xe2\x80\x94SPINOFF\n\nThe Imagery of Sound\n\nE\n\nngineers and designers can enjoy the benefit\nof software that measures the acoustical\nperformance of products. Automated\nAnalysis Corporation (AAC) of Ann Arbor,\nMichigan, and NASA have made this innovation\npossible.\nWith the help of Small Business Innovation\nResearch (SBIR) funds from NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Langley\nResearch Center, AAC developed computer\ntechnology that creates images of the acoustical\ncharacteristics of systems and components in many\nindustries, such as the aircraft, automotive, and\naudio systems industries. This type of software is\nuseful in Langley\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to optimize the acoustical performance of aircraft by predicting design\neffects, such as those within aircraft sidewalls and\nseating. AAC has made this technology available\nto its customers by offering COMET\xc2\xae\xe2\x80\x94a suite of\nacoustic analysis software for advanced noise\nprediction. COMET is used during the design and\nanalysis cycle of product development and offers\nengineers and designers the benefit of cost reduction and sound quality improvement by predicting\nthe product\xe2\x80\x99s sound performance even before the\nfirst prototype is built.\nCOMET analyzes the origin, radiation, and\nscattering of noise, and supplies information on\nhow to achieve noise reduction and improve sound\ncharacteristics. This software is a valuable tool in\nreducing design time and expense, while simultaneously optimizing a final product\xe2\x80\x99s acoustical\nperformance.\nCOMET\xe2\x80\x99s Structural Acoustic\nFoam Engineering (SAFE)\nmodule extends the sound field\nanalysis capability of foam and\nother absorptive materials.

Although foams themselves are not useful as sound\nbarriers, they are useful for sound absorption, and\nfor this reason, SAFE can help users optimize\nthose absorptive qualities.\nThe interactions among various domains are\ngeneralized so that all types of interface conditions\ncan be accurately modeled. This is especially\nimportant in foam-like materials, because the type\nof interaction among domains can significantly\naffect the acoustical performance of the product.\n\xe2\x80\x9c[SAFE] enables product engineers and designers to predict the noise performance of a wide\nvariety of materials, such as glass fiber, mineral\nwool, and open or partially open cell foams,\xe2\x80\x9d\naccording to Kim Novak, AAC company representative. These materials are found in a variety of\nproducts such as headliners, seats, carpets, trim\nlining, panel damping, aircraft skin insulation,\nbuilding wall insulation, machinery, and enclosure\nliners, and its uses continue to grow. SAFE provides a powerful tool that can be used for the\ndesign of optimal modern noise control treatments,\nthereby solving many acoustic problems in foam\nmaterials.\nAAC is a computer-aided engineering company,\nfounded in 1983, and provides consulting services\nto the aerospace and automotive industries. Other\nNASA-inspired products are being commercialized\nby AAC as well, promising great strides in effective sound design.\nComet\xc2\xae is a registered trademark of Automated Analysis Corporation.\n\n'
