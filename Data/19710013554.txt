Inasmuch as in the course of conducting a test\nthere may be considerable delay due to the need of adview taken through 4-4 of FIGURE 3.\n\n3,342,066\n3\njusting the equipment which is required for the test and\ndue to the fact that the flow of velocities may vary substantially rising from zero velocity to the test velocity,\nit is desirable that the model be held in place by means\nother than the mounting member until just before the 6\ntest is to take place. In order to secure the model prior to\ntest, there is provided a holder 25 which includes a body\n26 suitably mounted on the forward or upstream end of\nthe cylinder 5.\nThe body is provided with lateral bosses 27 which sup- 10\nport lever arms 28 by means of pivots 29. The lever arms\nextend downwardly and forwardly toward the model and\nare provided with adjustable extensions 30 secured to the\narms 28 by screws 31. The extremities of the extensions\n30 are provided with fingers 32 which conform to opposite 15\nsides of the model and are adjustable.\nThe lever arms are urged towards each other by a spring\n33 anchored at its extremity to opposed end pins 34 carried by the lever arms 28.\nThe body 26 is provided with a cross bore 35 which 20\nreceives slide pins 36 having reduced ends 37 Imsely fitting in openings provided in the lever arms 28. The conifronting ends of the pins 36 are conical as indicated by 38.\nThe cross bore 35 is intersected at its midpoint by a\nguide bore 39 which is enlarged at its rearward or down- 25\nstream end to form a cylinder 40 which receives a piston\n41. The piston 41 is provided with a stem 42 which fits\nthe guide bore 39 and is provided with a wedge tip 43\nadapted to pass between the confronting conical ends 38\nof the pins 36 so as to spread the pins and the lever 30\narms 28.\nThe cylinder 40 is provided with a cap 44 containing\na supply port 45 connected to a fluid supply line for the\npurpose of thrusting the piston 41 and stem 42 forwardly.\nA return spring 46 retracts the stem when the fluid pres- 35\nsure is relieved,\nOperation of the model launcher for wind tunnels is as\nfollows:\nThe launcher 3 is mounted downstream from the ob- 4o\nservation window 2 at such a distance that the shaft 8\nwhen in its extended position, shown in FIGURE 2,\nreaches approximately to the downstream side of the\nobservation window. The model 23 to be tested is placed\non the mounting member 18. The mounting member is\nadjusted so as to dispose the model initially at a selected 45\nangle of attack.\nInitially, the shaft 8 is in its retracted position and the\nfingers 32 of the holder 25 are positioned so as to retain\nthe model in place.\n60\nThe shaft 8 is held in its retracted position by the latch\npin 10. Prior to test, the charging chamber 6 is pressurized\nto a predetermined pressure calculated to drive the shaft\n8 and model forwardly or upstream against the high velocity fluid flowing in the wind tunnel. The velocity of the 55\nfluid may be several times the speed of sound.\nPrior to release of the latch pin 10, the fingers 32 are\nmoved laterally from the model 23. To begin the test, the\nlatch pin 10 is retracted causing the pressure fluid to drive\nthe shaft forward or upstream at a predetermined velocity. 60\nAs the shaft 8 reaches its forward or upstream position,\nits forward movement is snubbed causing the model 23\nto continue in an upstream direction and in free flight\nacross the observation window 2. The force applied is\ncalculated to cause the model to travel in free flight approximately the width of the observation window at which\npoint the force is expended whereupon the high velocity\nfluid drives the model backward with respect to the observation window as represented by the broken lines in 70\nFIGURE 2.\nAs a result, each test involves not only one but two\ntraverses of the observation window so as to provide a\ntest of maximum duration. Furthermore, inasmuch as the\nentire launch is downstream from the observation window 75\n\nand the model is in free flight, any disturbance in the flow\nof fluid is created by the model itself.\nIt should be noted that the models employed are expendable and are destroyed or damaged on impact against\nthe launcher itself or other surfaces downstream from the\nobservation window.\nWhile a particular embodiment of this invention has\nbeen shown and described, it is not intended to limit the\nsame to the details of the construction set forth, but instead, the invention embraces such changes, modifications\nand equivalents of the various parts and their relationships\nas come within the purview of the appended claims.\nI claim:\n1.
