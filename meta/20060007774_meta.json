These programs and the cabin atmosphere revitalization process technologies and systems developed for them represent the National Aeronautics and Space Administration s (NASA) past and present operational knowledge base for maintaining a safe, comfortable environment for the crew. The contributions of these programs to the NASA s technological and operational working knowledge base as well as key strengths and weaknesses to be overcome are discussed. Areas for technological development to address challenges inherent with the Vision for Space Exploration (VSE) are presented and a plan for their development employing unit operations principles is summarized", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20060007774, "endDate": "2006-01-12T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "44th Aerospace Sciences Meeting and Exhibit", "location": "Reno, NV", "id": "9e03046e96e94a03a566854f3d9ff21c", "startDate": "2006-01-09T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20060007774, "id": "f129679c88b049d28c13da35dfb9fc84", "publicationDate": "2006-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20060007774.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20060007774/downloads/20060007774.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20060007774/downloads/20060007774.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20060007774/downloads/20060007774.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
