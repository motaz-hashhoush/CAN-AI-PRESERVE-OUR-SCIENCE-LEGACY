Two cratering chronology models are presented and used for inference of absolute ages from crater frequency data, and it is shown that the interpretation of all data available and tractable by the methodology presented leads to a global Martian geological history that is characterized by two epochs of activity. It is concluded that Mars is an ancient planet with respect to its surface features.", "title": "Martian ages", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-11T04:24:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19810048189, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Neukum, G."}, "organization": {"name": "Ludwig-Maximilians-Univ.", "location": "Munich, Germany"}}, "id": "9eed1b18d6534819859b5141aeca2845"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19810048189, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Hiller, K."}, "organization": {"name": "Muenchen, Universitaet", "location": "Munich, Germany"}}, "id": "7afb3fc52cfe42389953fa46042865dd"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Reprint (Version printed in journal)", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-17T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19810048189, "publications": [{"volume": "86", "submissionId": 19810048189, "id": "ccf8f78c40fd457a98a6d3f674f5691c", "publicationName": "Journal of Geophysical Research", "publicationDate": "1981-04-10T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
