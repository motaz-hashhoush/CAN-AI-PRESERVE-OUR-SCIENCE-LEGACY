This year, demonstrations of Internet access to a flying spacecraft have been performed with the UoSAT-12 spacecraft owned and operated by Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd. (SSTL). Previously, demonstrations were performed using a ground satellite simulator and NASA's Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS). These activities are part of NASA's Space Operations Management Office (SOMO) Technology Program, The work is focused on defining the communication architecture for future NASA missions to support both NASA's \"faster, better, cheaper\" concept and to enable new types of collaborative science. The use of standard Internet communication technology for spacecraft simplifies design, supports initial integration and test across an IP based network, and enables direct communication between scientists and instruments as well as between different spacecraft, The most recent demonstrations consisted of uploading an Internet Protocol (IP) software stack to the UoSAT- 12 spacecraft, simple modifications to the SSTL ground station, and a series of tests to measure performance of various Internet applications. The spacecraft was reconfigured on orbit at very low cost. The total period between concept and the first tests was only 3 months. The tests included basic network connectivity (PING), automated clock synchronization (NTP), and reliable file transfers (FTP). Future tests are planned to include additional protocols such as Mobile IP, e-mail, and virtual private networks (VPN) to enable automated, operational spacecraft communication networks. The work performed and results of the initial phase of tests are summarized in this paper. This work is funded and directed by NASA/GSFC with technical leadership by CSC in arrangement with SSTL, and Vytek Wireless.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20000082021, "endDate": "2000-08-24T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "Conference on Small Satellites UTSU", "location": "Logan, UT", "id": "aa705004f3f64cfa8e257c0f4827a593", "startDate": "2000-08-21T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20000082021, "id": "e99747795e24413eb8b247bea476a6f8", "publicationDate": "2000-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20000082021.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20000082021/downloads/20000082021.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20000082021/downloads/20000082021.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20000082021/downloads/20000082021.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
