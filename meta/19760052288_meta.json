A rocket launching was simulated. The motions of both the rocket and the launcher can be considered in detail. The model contains flexible elements and rigid elements. The rigid elements (masses) were judiciously utilized to simplify the derivation of the equations. The advantages of simultaneous shoe release were illustrated. Also, the loading history of the interstage structure of a boosted configuration was determined. The equations shown in this analysis could be used as a design tool during the modification of old launchers and the design of new launchers.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"submissionId": 19760052288, "endDate": "1976-06-25T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "Sounding Rocket Technology Conference", "location": "Boston, MA", "id": "2393a0d61f0f435aa89cdd4264175914", "startDate": "1976-06-23T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 19760052288, "id": "386ef6e9eb1749759a4e98523b986238", "publicationDate": "1976-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
