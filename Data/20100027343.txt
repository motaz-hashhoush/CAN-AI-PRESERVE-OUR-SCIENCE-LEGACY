b'Climate Benchmark Missions: CLARREO\nBruce Wielicki and David Young, NASA Langley Research Center, Hampton, VA\nWMO-BIPM workshop on \xe2\x80\x9cMeasurement Challenges for Global Observing Systems for\nClimate Change Monitoring: Traceability, Stability, and Uncerrtainty\nMarch 30 to April 2, 2010\nGeneva, Switzerland\nCLARREO (Climate Absolute Radiance and Refractivity Observatory) is one of the four\nTier 1 missions recommended by the recent NRC decadal survey report on Earth\nScience and Applications from Space (NRC, 2007). The CLARREO mission addresses\nthe need to rigorously observe climate change on decade time scales and to use\ndecadal change observations as the most critical method to determine the accuracy of\nclimate change projections such as those used in the Fourth Assessment Report of the\nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC AR4). A rigorously known accuracy\nof both decadal change observations as well as climate projections is critical in order to\nenable sound policy decisions. The CLARREO mission accomplishes this critical\nobjective through highly accurate and SI traceable decadal change observations\nsensitive to many of the key uncertainties in climate radiative forcings, responses, and\nfeedbacks that in turn drive uncertainty in current climate model projections. The same\nuncertainties also lead to uncertainty in attribution of climate change to anthropogenic\nforcing.\nThe CLARREO breakthrough in decadal climate change observations is to achieve the\nrequired levels of accuracy and traceability to SI standards for a set of observations\nsensitive to a wide range of key decadal change variables. These accuracy levels are\ndetermined both by the projected decadal changes as well as by the background natural\nvariability that such signals must be detected against. The accuracy for decadal change\ntraceability to SI standards includes uncertainties of calibration, sampling, and analysis\nmethods. Unlike most other missions, all of the CLARREO requirements are judged not\nby instantaneous accuracy, but instead by accuracy in large time/space scale average\ndecadal changes.\nGiven the focus on decadal climate change, the NRC Decadal Survey concluded that\nthe single most critical issue for decadal change observations was their lack of accuracy\nand low confidence in observing the small but critical climate change signals.\nCLARREO is the recommended attack on this challenge, and builds on the last decade\nof climate observation advances in the Earth Observing System as well as metrological\nadvances at NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) and other standards\nlaboratories.\n\nThe presentation will summarize the planned CLARREO observations, science\npriorities, requirements, and the dual strategy to provide climate change benchmarks\ndirectly from CLARREO observations, as well as to serve as a set of reference\nspectrometers in orbit capable of improving the calibration of other weather and climate\nsensors.\n\n'
