b"Patient Monitoring In photo above, the electrocardiogram of a hospitalized patient is being\ntransmitted by telemetry. Widely employed in\nspace operations, telemetry is a process wherein instrument data is converted to electrical\nsignals and sent to a receiver where the signals\nare reconverted to usable information. In this\ninstance, heart readings are picked up by the\nelectrode attached to the patient's body and\ndelivered by wire to the small box shown, which\nis a telemetry transmitter. The signals are\nrelayed wirelessly to the console in the background, which converts them to EKG data. The\ndata is displayed visually and recorded on a\nprintout; at the same time, it is transmitted to a\ncentral control station (upper photo) where a\nnurse can monitor the condition of several\npatients simultaneously.\nThe Patient Monitoring System was developed by SCI Systems, Inc., Huntsville, Alabama,\nin conjunction with Abbott Medical Electronics,\nHouston, Texas. In developing the system, SCI\n\ndrew upon its extensive experience as a NASA\ncontractor. The company applied telemetry\ntechnology developed for the Saturn launch\nvehicle and the Apollo spacecraft; instrumentation technology developed for heart, blood pressure and sleep monitoring of astronauts aboard\nNASA's Skylab long duration space station; and\ncommunications technology developed for the\nSpace Shuttle.\nTelemetry reduces the time needed for\npersonal attendance by nurse or physician and\npermits round-the-clock monitoring with minimal\ninconvenience to the patient. An ambulatory\npatient can walk around, unencumbered by\nwires, while his EKG is continuously recorded;\nhe can even leave his hospital room and move\nas far as 400 feet without interrupting the data\nrelay. For intensive care situations where monitoring a number of other vital signs is necessary, SCI has developed a family of clinical\ninstruments which can be employed in the\nPatient Monitoring System.\n\n"
