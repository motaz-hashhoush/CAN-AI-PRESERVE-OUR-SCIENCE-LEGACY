I has been selected.\nConventional aerodynamic control systems are to be utilized.\nInternal and external catenary systems will be\nused to attach the payload. Propulsion system and associated equipment to the blimp envelope since this technique has been operaUonal for some time. Typical construction methods\nof earlier Non-Rigid Airships will be utilized which have never had a failure in flight from\nstructural\n\nor materials\n\ncauses.\n\nThe catenary curtain _stributes\nthe leads in the suspension cables Into the envelope materiai in a precise and uniform manner. The rudder/elevators\nare typical aircraft fabric\ncovered metal frames for low weight\xe2\x80\xa2 The central bai|onet permits control of envelope\np_\'essure during a_titude and temperature variations.\nA continuously running fan will provide ballonet air. Ballonet pressure will be cGntrolled by an automatic airship-type,\nlow\npressure-high\nvolume, relief valve.\nA film/fabric laminate material will be used for envelope construction consisting of mylar\nfilm and dacron cloth impregnated _vith an elastomer.\nA white hypaion surface coating will\nb_ applied externally to provide scuff resistance and desirable thermal properties\xe2\x80\xa2\nLightweight stretched fabric will be used in the tall fin construction to conserve weight and enhance design simplicity.\nThe low internal helium pressure of about 2.5 inches of _ter and the rip-stop fabric make\nminor punctures or holes of little liigntflcance.\nMany airships have i_ea operated for a\nfull week with l-inch holes in the _abric.\nThe RPV blimp inflated with helium is judged to give the proper Imoyance with the following\ninitial estimated weight distribution:\nWeight.
