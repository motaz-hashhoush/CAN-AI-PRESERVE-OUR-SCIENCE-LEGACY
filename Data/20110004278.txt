Why not put off such a\nbig expense as long as possible and\nat the same time, spend less to run\nthe car you now own? The money\nyou save is money in your pocket.\nTens of thousands of drivers are\nalready using Tufoil to "beat the\nsystem". Here\'s how it\'s done ... it\'s\nsimple!\nENGINES LAST & LAST\nThe normal life of an engine is usually about 100,000 miles, give or take\na few miles either way. This is no\nlonger the case. By adding 4 ounces\nof Tufoil with each oil change,\ntogether with an effective maintenance program, 200,000 miles and\nmore are not uncommon. But that\'s\nnot all!\nTogether with this extended engine\nlife are numerous benefits. For instance, quick acceleration. One user\nwrites that his car " Takes off like a\nscared rabbit!"\nSILKY SMOOTH OPERATION\nThat\'s just the beginning! Easy starts\nand better gas mileage are soon\napparent due to the reduction in friction. Your engine is now free to run\nsmoooothly.\n\nOne of our customers put it nicely\nwhen he said, "You can hear it, you\ncan feel it," with Tufoil in the engine.\nPROVEN EFFECTIVE\nOur files bulge with testimonials.\nCustomers not only call, but write to\nus about their fantastic results!\nThey\'re telling friends and relatives.\nAs a matter of fact they\'re spreading\n\n"TUFOIL \'\nSLIPPERIER\nTHAN\nTEFLON \' ..\n\nthe news about Tufoil all over the\nworld.\nIt stands to reason, though. Tufoil is\nso unique that even the United\nStates and Canadian governments\nhave confirmed it\'s effectiveness.\nOne report shows that Tufoil is actually slipperier than Teflon""!\nNO TIME LIKE THE PRESENT\nThere\'s never been a better time to\ntry Tufoil and prove to yourself and\nyour car that what everyone\'s been\nsaying is really true! We think you\'ll\nfind it\'s one of the smartest decisions\nyou\'ve made. In fact we\'re so sure,\nwe guarantee it\'ll work. If you don\'t\nagree, we\'ll gladly refund your\n$14.25, the cost of your initial 8\nounce treatment.\nSo why wait any longer? The sooner\nyou start, the better!

Some 50 federal labs have\nsigned on to exhibit and/or present\npapers, representing NASA, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the\ndepartments of Agriculture, Commerce,\nDefense, Energy, Health and Human\nServices, Interior, Transportation, and\nVeterans Affairs.\nThe latest news is that this year an\ninteragency government group (the\nagencies that comprise the FCCSET*\nCommittee on Industry and Technology) will hold a meeting on Intelligent\nProcessing Equipment (IPE) concurrently with Technology 2001 . IP E is one\nof four key technologies for advanced\nmanufacturing identified by the National Critical Technologies Panel in a\nrecent report to President Bush. It includes a broad range of computercontrolled equipment designed to improve the efficiency of manufacturing\nprocesses such as machining, forming, welding, heat-treating , inspecting,\nand material handling.\nThrough symposia, exhibits, and\ngovernment-industry discussion sessions, the IPE meeting will report on\ncurrent federal R&D efforts in intelligent processing and begin to identify\nprivate sector needs in this area. This\n\nwill lay the groundwork for the transfer\nof IPE technology to industry.\nParticipants will include many of the\nfederal agencies I listed earlier, as well\nas the Office of Science and Technology Policy and the Office of Management and Budget. Arrangements are\nalso being considered for a lunch or\nbreakfast talk by a nationally-recognized expert in advanced manufacturing.\nFurther details on the IPE meeting\nwill appear in next month\'s NASA Tech\nBriefs.

These intelligent\nmachines will build structures in orbit,\nclean up toxic wastes on Earth, and\nperform repetitive manufacturing tasks.\nAnd that\'s just the beginning, according\nto Dr. Neville Marzwell, the technical\nmanager of several NASA Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) contracts that aim to produce smarter,\nstronger robots. "The rapid evolution of\nrobotics technology promises to widen\nthe scope of its application to space\ncommercialization , mining, and exploration," Marzwell said.\nMarzwell is a member of the Robotics and Automation Systems section at\nNASA\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. JPL\nprovides international leadership in robotics, producing state-of-the-art technology in areas such as teleoperated\nand supervisory control , planning and\nscheduling , robotic inspection , en hanced sensory systems. and artificial\nintelligence. Marzwell. aJPL employee\nsince 1982, applies this expertise to\nNASA\'s mission of space exploration.\nHis primary focus is development and\nimplementation of semiautonomous\nsystems for assembling space structures and servicing spacecraft.\nThrough remote operation of robotic systems. humans can guide many\nphases of space construction and exploration without the high risk and cost\nof manned space flight ~ It is only by\nconsidering cost in the planning phases\nof these enormous projects that we will\nrealize the vast potential of space exploration," said Marzwell. who holds a\nPhD in applied physics from the California Institute of Technology.\nMany of the latest robotics advances\ncan also be applied terrestrially. In recent years, NASA has increasingly promoted the timely transfer of space technology to industry, where robots can\nassume dangerous or difficult tasks.\nThis drive to share knowledge has led\nto Marzwell\'s involvement in various\n\nTo gher Telerobots\n\nW\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 1991\n\nA new prototype robot features two\ndexterous arms, a movable head. two\nCCD cameras for producing stereoscopic\nviews, and an articulated lower body.\nPhoto courtesy ScientifIC Research AsSOCIates\n\nSBIR projects. "Through these relationships," he said, "NASA helps the\nsmall business community bring technology to market."\nHaving scanned robotics technology around the globe, Marzwell considers it the most promising way to increase business productivity. "Implementing robotic automation has a mUltiplier effect on investments by reducing and avoiding human error and by\naffording 24-hour production," he explained. "We can greatly increase our\nstandard of living by automating the\nmanufacture of key industrial components."\nSuch promise, he said, can be realized through mechanical systems combining autonomous with teleoperative\nfunctions. Autonomous operation, useful for simple or repetitive jobs such as\nunscrewing bolts, is prohibitively expensive for singular complex tasks.\nThese are better accomplished with\nhuman guidance. The ideal system will\ncombine or alternate between autonomy and teleoperation, depending\non the task.\nOne such flexible system has been\n\ndeveloped through an SBIR contract\nwith Scientific Research Associates .\nThe robot has 18 degrees of freedom ,\nstereoscopic real-time vision. two cooperatively dexterous arms, and expandable shoulders, all of which enable\nitto perform complex mechanical tasks.\nIts arms can wield various tools and\nperform preCise functions such as replacing microelectronic chips and cir:\ncuit boards. Moreover, artificial intelligence enables the robot to learn from\nits mistakes by storing data from previous tasks. Although modular in design\nfor ease of repair and upgrading, the\nrobot\'s many subcomponents work in\nharmony under the guidal]ce of a local\narea network (LAN) computer system .\nA second type of manipulator, developed for JPL by Odetics Inc., is also\nhighly dexterous but designed to carry\nmuch heavier loads. The lightweight,\nhigh-strength arm features seven degrees of freedom and can lift 50 pounds\nat Earth gravity. Originally developed\nto lift and transport large assembly\n(continued on page 92)\n\nDr. Neville Marzwell oversees several\nSBIR projects aimed at producing\nsmarter, stronger robots for space and\nindustrial applications.\nPhoto courtesy JPl\n\nNew Product Ideas\nNew Product Ideas are just\na few of the many innovations\ndescribed in this issue of\nNASA Tech Briefs and having\npromising commercial applications.

The\nconverter is suitable for high-voltage, lowcurrent applications. During tests, the converter stepped-up 90 V dc from a dry battery to 3.3 kV dc, at currents up to several\nmicroarnperes.\nThe converter (see figure) includes a\nfirst bank of five capacitors, C, through\nC5 , a second bank of eight capacitors, C6\nthrough C\'3\' and a filter capacitor, Ct. The\ncapacitors are connected to each other\nthrough a network of optically isolated\nsolid-state switching devices, r, through\nr20 and s, through S\'9\' A controller that\ncontains transistorltransistor-Iogic integrated circuits generates a twe-phase switchcontrolling signal.\nAt the beginning of the first half cycle,\nthe r switches are turned off and the s\nswitches are turned on, thereby connecting C, through C5\' in parallel, to the input\nvoltage, Vi \' and disconnecting these\ncapacitors from the others. These capacitors quickly charge up to Vi\' At the beginning of the next half cycle, the s switches\n\nare turned off and the r switches are turned\non; this disconnects C, through C5 from\nthe power supply and connects them in\nseries so that, in combination, they act as\nan intermediate source of voltage~ \'\n5~. At the same time, C6 through C\'3 are\nconnected in parallel to the series combination of C, through C5, thereby charging C6 through C\'3 to nearly the intermediate source voltage ~ \'.\nAt the beginning of the next half cycle\n(which is the same as the first half cycle),\nC6 through C\'3 are connected to each\nother in series, disconnected from C,\nthrough C5 , and connected to Ct and the\nload. The series combination of C6 through\nC\'3 acts as a source of voltage 8V:\n40~. This source \'vQltage charges Ct, which\nin turn supplies current to the load. In practice the actual voltage gain is slightly less\nthan 40. The reasons for this reduction are\nas follows: Because of non-zero conductance, a small amount of intra-circuit current exists during the off state of the solidstate relay; this gives rise to unwanted\ndischarge of the capaCitors.

It is desirable to reduce the\ncross-polarized component because this\ncomponent can adversely affect the symmetry of the radiated beam and because\nit produces little or no useful signal power\nin another antenna aligned to receive in\nthe expected polarization.\nTo make it operable over a wide frequency band, a microstrip antenna is usually\nconstructed on a thick dielectric substrate.\nUnfortunately, a thick substrate supports\nthe higher-order electromagnetic modes\nthat give rise to asymmetry and cross\npolarization. Previously, all the microstrip\npatches in an array antenna were fed in\nthe same phase, at the same location\nrelative to the center of each patch (see\nFigure 1). This asymmetrical arrangement\ncan result in significant excitation of higherorder modes. In the new configuration, the\npatches are fed on OPPOSing sides, in oppoSite phases. This combination of spatial\nsymmetry and temporal asymmetry causes\nthe copolarized components of radiation\nfrom the fundamental modes of the patches to reinforce each other and the crosspolarized components of radiation from the\nhigher-order modes to cancel each other.\nTo test this concept, two microstrip antennas like those shown in Figure 1 were\nconstructed . The patches were 3.025-in.\n(7 .68-cm) squares, and the substrate was\n1/2-in. (12 .7-mm)-thick foam with a dielectric constant of 1.05. The antennas were\ndesigned to resonate at frequencies from\n\n20\n\n1.55 to 1.66 GHz, and the distance between the elements along both principal\naxes was 0.6 wavelength at the middle\nfrequency.\nFigure 2 contains plots of measured and\ncalculated intensities of the copolarized\nand cross-polarized components of radiation from the two antennas in the magnetic-field plane of the nominal radiated\nbeam. These plots show clearly that the\ncross-polarized component is reduced by\nthe new feed configuration.\n\nThis work was done by John Huang of\nCaltech for NASA\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

Intended for use aboard spacecraft, batteries of this type might also be used, for\nexample, in surgically implanted devices\nrequiring high power. Heretofore, betavoltaics have been used in surgically implanted devices - specifically, heart pacemakers, but these consume powers of no\nmore than a few microwatts.\nA betavoltaic cell functions analogously to a photovoltaic cell, except that the role\nof the photons is played by energetic electrons (f3 particles) generated by the radioactive decay of a suitable material. The\n{3 particles traverse the cell, losing kinetic\nenergy and creating pairs of holes and\nelectrons. Those holes and electrons that\nlie within a diffusion length of the pin junction of the cell are swept across the junction and contribute to the output current\nof the cell. An equivalent circuit for such\na cell is identical to that of a solar photovoltaic cell.\nPreviously. betavoltaics were not considered for supplying powers of the order\nof watts because available materials pro-\n\nvided low energy-conversion efficiencies\nand were vulnerable to damage by the\nhigh-energy incident {3 particles. However,\nthe energy-conversion efficiencies of\nreoently developed betavoltaic cells are\nappreciably greater than those of the previous cells. In addition, it appears that\nbetavoltaic cells can be produced economically in quantity by use of solar-cell\ntechnology.\nThe figure illustrates a conceptual betavoltaic cell and battery. The cell would be\na simple pin-junction device to which a\nlayer of {3-emitting material would be attached. There would be an optimum thickness for the {3-emitting layers: each layer\nwould have to be thick enough to emit a\nsufficient number of particles, but diminishing returns would be reached at thicknesses great enough to result in the reabsorption of the emitted particles. A battery\nwould contain a stack of {3-emitting layers\ninterspersed with enough pIn-junction devices to stop most of the {3 particles. The\nbattery would be encased in a suitable {3backscattering material to prevent any {3\nparticles from escaping.\nA GaP betavoltaic cell has been de-\n\nveloped. GaP is believed to be particularly suitable because it has relatively wide\nenergy-band gaps of 2.2 eV (indirect) and\n2.7 eV (direct) and because a wide gap is\nassociated with the ability te resist damage by the {3 particles. The GaP cell is a\npIn device, grown and diffused by liquidphase epitaxy. The measured powerconversion efficiency for the partioular cell\nis 8.4 percent, and the theoretically attainable power-conversion efficiency of\nGaP cells in general is almost 25 percent.\nThe most suitable source of {3 particles\nfor high power applications appears to be\n90Sr (which has a half life of 28 years).\nPreliminary calculations indicate that a battery with 90Sr sources could be made to\nhave an initial specific power of about 3\nW/kg. Similar calculations for cells made\nwith 204TI {3 emitters (half life 4 years) indicate an initial specific power as high as\n8 W/kg.\nThis vvork was done by Frederick S.

When\nthe instrument is commanded to turn to\na new line of sight, signals from rotation\xc2\xb7\nrate sensors (e.g., gyroscopes) are processed into transformed coordinates and\nused along with the angle-error signals to\ncontrol the slew - the rapid turn through\nmost of the angular interval between the\nold and new commanded orientations (see\nFigure 1). To obtain the shortest possible\n\nrotation, the line of sight is ordinarily slewed\nin the plane that contains the old and new\ncommanded lines of sight. The desired\nmotion is obtained by controlling the applied torques so as to make the instrument\nrotate about a slewing axis perpendicular\nto this plane.\nThe instrument is equipped with a Sun\nsensor that indicates the orientation of the\nline of sight to the Sun relative to the line\nof sight of the instrument. The avoidance\ncontrol logic does not affect the motion until and unless, at some point along the\nslewing trajectory, these two lines of sight\ncome within an angle 8 of each other; that\nis, the avoidance-control logic remains inoperative until the line of sight of the instrument enters a cone of avoidance of\nhalf apex angle 8 about the line of sight\nto the Sun.\nOnce activated, the avoidance control\nlogic interrupts the normal control logic.\nIt then calculates a succession of temporary slewing axes and associated actuator torques so as to make the line of\nsight follow the shorter of the two trajec-\n\nFigure 1. The Slew-Control System includes avoidance-control\nlogic. which overrides the slew-control error generator when the line of\nsight of the instrument comes within a cone of avoidance around the line\nof sight to the Sun.\n\ntories around the cone of avoidance. Once\nsensors indicate that the line of sight has\nreached the end of the trajectory around\nthe cone of aVOidance, the avoidance control logic is deactivated, the normal control logic resumes operation, and the instrument starts to tum again on the original\nslewing axis toward the new commanded target.\nThis work was done by Neil E.

This system took\nadvantage of the parallelism offered by the\nfinite-difference technique of computing\ngradients to enable several workstations\nto contribute simultaneously to the solution of the problem. The resulting system\nreduced the time to complete one optimization cycle from 2 hours to one-half\nhour. with a potential of reducing it to 15\nminutes.\nThe major tools used for this project\n\nwere the hardware (DEC MicroVAX computer workstations and DEC 111785 minicomputer). the software (PROSSS. Programming System for Structural Synthesis). and the networks (DECnet and\nLaRCNE1).\nPROSSS. a system of computer programs that combines structural analysis\nand optimization. was chosen as the software tool because the majority of the code\nin PROSSS was independent of the type\nof problem being solved. In addition.\nPROSSS had been converted earlier to run\non the workstations and had been verified\nwith the standard test cases. EAL (Engineering Analysis Language) was chosen\nfor the structural analysis.\n\nDesigning the Future\nwith Algor\n\n"Algor\'s FEA Design System has excellent processors, powerful graphics\nand accuracy at a price that has no match on the market" Stefan B.

The DECnet (the DEC software\nand hardware that enable different DEC\noperating systems to operate as a network) connected the workstations through\nan Ethernet circuit. The LaRCNET is the\nlocal-area network developed specifically for NASA\'s Langley Research Center to\nprovide a center-wide capability for\ntransferring data files among distributed\nsystems of computers from multiple\nvendors.\nInitially, PROSSS was executed sequentially on a Single workstation. With a fourworkstation distributed system, time was\ndecreased by approximately a factor of 4.\nOne workstation was used as the controlling system. The front processor, run as a\nstand-alone program on the controlling\nworkstation, was modified to loop through\nthe deSign variables, perturbing them one\nat a time and creating a separate file for\neach design variable with the changed\nshape in the form of updated jOint locations. All workstations were sent a command file with checks to prevent them\nfrom executing until all of the required data\nwere available. Once the analysis of the\nmathematical model with a perturbed\nshape was completed, an EAL library file\ncontaining the objective function, stresses,\nand reactions was sent to the controlling\nworkstation. If the model was optimized,\nthe system stopped; otherwise, it looped\nback to the front processor to begin a new\ncycle with a new shape determined by the\nchange in the design variables.\nThe software system that couples structural analysis and optimization has been\nsuccessfully distributed over this network\nof workstations. By distributing the workload over four workstations instead of just\none, the time required to complete an optimization cycle decreased from 2 hours\nto one-half hour. Because of the enhanced\nproductivity achieved with the distributed\nsystem, engineers were able to test more\nalternatives in a shorter time. The key features were the effective use of redundancies in hardware (multiple workstations\nand two networks) and flexible software,\nwhich enabled the optimization to proceed\nwith minimal delay and decreased overall\ntime to completion.\n\nThis work was done by James L.\nRogers, Jr., Katherine C.

August 1991\n\nVi deo Pipeline Tree for Scan Conversion of Triangles\nScenes containing many polygons could be generated in real time.\nAmes Research Center, Moffett Field, California\nA video pipeline subsystem having a\nbranched structure would perform the\nscan conversion of polygons in images\ngenerated by computers. Heretofore, the\nconversion of computer -generated image\ncoordinates, brightnesses, and colors of\npolygons to raster-scanning video signals\ncould not be done rapidly enough for the\ngeneration of realistic images containing\nmany polygons at the standard television\nrate of 30 frames per second. The new\nsubsystem would divide the polygons into\ntriangles, each of which would be processed rapidly in parallel, modular fashion\nand merged into the image. One proposed\nversion, to consist of 127 integrated-circuit\nchips, could render 1,000 triangles in real\ntime.\nFigure 1 illustrates schematically a portion of the scan conversion of one triangle.\nThe three control signals that define the\nraster are broadcast from a central controller to all such Circuits. In synchronization with the raster video signal, this circuit\nwould compute a color, the coordinate z\n(depth perpendicular to the image plane),\nor another linear function of the image\ncoordinates x and y, using z = ax + by\n+ c. The coefficients a, b, and c would be\nobtained from the computer specification\nof the image and would be used to compute the coefficients A, B, and C, which\nwould be held in registers A, B, and C, respectively.\nSeven such linear-function circuits\nwould be combined into a module to pro-\n\nduce a stream of data representative of\none triangle. The seven functions would be\nz, red, green, blue, and three edge functions. Altogether, the data stream would be\n49 bits wide: 24 bits for z, 8 bits for each col\xc2\xb7\nor intensity, and a transparency bit that\nindicates whether the current picture element is inside or outside the triangle (if out\xc2\xb7\nside, then the other bits have no meaning\nand are to be ignored). The number of bits\nused in the internal computations of the\nlinear-function circuit would be greater\nthan the number of bits in the data streams.\nA large number of these triangle modules would feed their 49-bit output data\nstreams into the "leaves" of a binary tree\nat the standard video rate of about 10 MHz.\nAt each branch point of the tree, a merging\nmodule would combine two of the data\nstreams into one (see Figure 2). Of the two\ninputs to each merging module, one would\nbe selected for output: If both picture\nelements were transparent, either could\nbe selected. If one were opaque and the\nother transparent, the opaque one would\nbe selected. If both were opaque, the one\nwith the smallest value of L (the one in front)\nwould be selected as in a standard z-buffer\nalgorithm. The output \xc2\xb7of each merging\nmodule would serve as the input to a merg\xc2\xb7\ning module at the next level of the tree.\nAs many triangle modules as possible\nwould be put onto one integrated-circuit\nchip so that the chip would constitute a\ncomplete binary tree of merging modules\nwith a triangle module at each "leaf." The\n\nFigure 1. A Linear Function z of Image Coordinates x and y is\ngenerated in synchronism with the video raster signal. Thus, z(x,y)\nrepresents the function (depth or color) associated with the coordinates\nof the current picture element (x,y) in the video signal. The registers A, B,\nand Ccontain the coefficients of the function , which can change with time.\n\n~\n\n______\n\n~\nA~\n\nSelect 1 or 2\n......._ _ _ _ _ _~ Based on Comparison\nZ1\n\nControl and\nSynchronizing Signalo\n\nchip would therefore have output pins for\nthe 49-bit video-data stream emerging\nfrom the tree. The chip would also have address and data pins so that the "front-end"\nprocessor that performs the geometric\ntransformations and calculates the coefficients for the triangles could write the coefficients into the chip.\nMany such triangle chips could be built\ninto a larger binary tree, connected by\nmerging-module chips. Because it would\ncontain only the merger logic, a merging\xc2\xb7\nmodule chip would be relatively simple.\nHowever, it would require a total of 147 pins\nfor the two 49-bit inputs and one 49-bit output.lt might be possible to reduce the number of pins and, therefore, the cost, by timemultiplexing the data onto fewer pins at a\nhigher bit rate.\nAn alternative design would be a linear\npipeline of triangle chips, in which each\ntriangle chip had a 49-bit input feeding into\none leaf of its internal merge tree. The control signals would have to be staggered for\nthe triangle chips in this linear pipeline. The\nmerge chips would not be needed.\nThis work was done by Warren Robinett\nof Ames Research Center.

After some fine adjustments\nof the parameters of the digital compensator, the gain and phase margins and the\nresponse of the entire system containing\nthe proposed digital compensator are\nfound to exceed those obtained with the\npresent analog compensator. In addition,\nthe response is found to be well damped\nin comparison with that of the present system. The simulation shows that the digitally\ncompensated telescope would respond\nwith tracking errors peaking around 0.27\narcsec (a root-mean-square tracking error\nof less than 1 arcsec is acceptable).\nRnaJly, the selection of equipment to implement the digital control system is discussed.

To do\nthis, it must reject both random disturbances like vibrations of the airplane and\nsteady disturbances like imbalance of the\ntelescope.

The phase and frequency of the received signal may also be affected by a Doppler shift, and the instantaneous amplitude of the received signal\nis corrupted by additive white Gaussian\nnoise. Signals of this type are ordinarily\nused in spacecraft telemetry, the sinewave subcarrier being preferred for shorter\nsignal paths and the square-wave subcarrier for longer signal paths.\nThe carrier component of the received\nsignal is not completely suppressed, and\nthe Costas loop reconstructs its carrier\nreference from this component. The residual-carrier modulation, Doppler shift,\nand noise degrade the ability of the Costas\nloop to lock onto the carrier signal. The\nstudy focuses on this degradation. As\nsuch, it extends a previous study of the\nperformance of a Costas loop with a residual carrier but without phase-shift-keyed\nsubcarrier modulation. In the previous\nstudy, it was assumed that the phase error of the Costas loop approaches zero at\nhigh signal-to-noise ratios. In this study, the\nphase error is assumed to remain small\nenough to keep the response of the loop\nwithin its approximately linear range, but\nit is not required to approach zero at high\nsignal-to-noise ratios. This study also considers the maximum allowable telemetry\nrate for a specified tracking phase jitter\nand for a given combination of signal-tonoise ratio and bandwidth constraint.\nIt is shown both algebraically and by\nnumerical examples that the Costas loop\ncan be used to track the signals in the\npresence of the Doppler shift. The tracking performance is degraded in the sense\nthat the mean-square phase jitter increases when a residual carrier is present. The\ntracking performance of a Costas loop is\ndegraded further when the modulation index rises toward a critical value. At any\nsignal-to-noise ratio, the loop ceases to\nlock onto the carrier when the critical value\nis reached. (The critical values for the\nsquare-wave- and sine-wave-subcarrier\nversions are different.) The performance\ncan be optimized (in the sense that the\nmean-square tracking phase jitter can be\nminimized) by choosing the appropriate\ncombination of (1) frequency of the subcarrier, (2) square or sinusoidal waveform\nof the subcarrier, (3) bit rate, and (4) noise\n30\n\nbandwidth of the low-pass filters in the\narms of the Costas loop.\nThis work was done by Tien M.

Digital accumulators are used extensively in\nthese and other signal-processing circuits\nto compute averages and reduce processing rates. The report emphasizes problems encountered with respect to digital\naccumulators in the operation of receivers\nin the Global Positioning System (GPS).\nThese receivers are required to track the\nphases and frequencies of the GPS carrier signals, which can be weak and are\nDoppler shifted by the high dynamics (high\nspeeds, high accelerations, and sometimes high jerks) of the receiver with respect to the GPS spacecraft. Notwithstanding the emphasis on the GPS, the conclusions reached in this investigation are also\napplicable to more general receivers or\nqther signal-processing systems that include digital accumulators.\nThe investigation focused on three different tracking loops: a digital phase-locked\nloop, a cross-product automatic frequencycontrol loop, and an extended Kalman filter.\nAlgorithms that represent these loops were\ntested in a computer simulation. In addition , a hybrid analog/digital receiver was\nbuilt to implement the algorithms, and the\nperformances of the loops were measured\nto verify the simulations.\nThe report contains four sections. The\nfirst discusses the general problem and\nthe questions that this investigation was\nintended to answer, reviews previous research on Doppler tracking in the presence of high dynamics, describes digital\nimplementation of tracking loops, and introduces mathematical models that represent GPS signals under worst-case dynamics. The second chapter describes the\nhybrid analog digital receiver.\nThe third chapter describes the algorithms of the three loops. The results of\nthe simulations and tests are presented in\nthis chapter as various plots of frequency\n\nerrors, amplitude losses, and probabilities\nof loss of lock vs. carrier-to-noise ratios,\nand as transient responses in terms of frequency errors and amplitude losses vs.\ntime. The third chapter continues by comparing the performances of the three loops\nand ends by stating two conclusions: (1)\nsimulations carried out without including\nthe effects of digital accumulators can lead\nto erroneous predictions of performance,\nespecially at low carrier-to-noise ratios,\nand (2) of the loops tested, the fourth-order\nversion of the Extended Kalman filter performed the best.\nThe fourth chapter, which is very brief,\nsummarizes the investigation, restating the\nfirst of the above-mentioned conclusions.\nIt notes that at high carrier-to-noise ratios,\nthe effects of digital accumulators are\nnegligible, but that at low carrier-to-noise\nratios, digital accumulators contribute substantial losses. It recommends that additional losses in threshold carrier-to-noise\nratios should always be included in simulations to account for the digital accumulators. This could be done by including additional amplitude-suppression terms.\nThis work was done by Sami Hinedi and\nJoseph /. Statman of Galtech for NASA\'s\nJet Propulsion Laboratory.

It focuses upon the problems\nthat were experienced during the develo~\nment of the Telerobot Testbed System at\nNASA\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL): an\nintegrated robotic testbed used to develop,\nimplement, and evaluate the performance\nof advanced concepts in autonomous, teleautonomous, and teleoperated control of\nrobotic manipulators. The objective of this\nreport is to provide information that can\nbe used to guide and expedite the devel~\nment of future integrated robotic systems.\nProblems are identified in calibration and\nworld modeling, process planning, and system architecture and software engineering.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Calibration. Galibration issues in an integrated multisensory, multiactuated robotic\nsystem can have a profound impact upon\nthe design, implementation, and performance of high-Ievel-control and task-planning algorithms. As a prime example of\nthis, the authors cite the difficulties involved in merging information from vision\nand touch sensors to estimate the locaNASA Tech Briefs, August 1991\n\ntion of an object in the workspace.\nTo merge information from disparate\nsensors, the informa1ion obtained by each\nmust be transformed into a common representation to permit integration. In addition to providing a means for integration,\nthe representation must also serve the informational needs of the rest of the system. In the Testbed, the common representation is a tree-topology connected\ndata base describing the spatial relationships among all the objects.\nThe difficulty in integrating the various\nsensor information has arisen, in part,\nfrom the fact that several of the sensors\n(i.e., two force/torque sensors and two\ncameras) are mounted on independent\nplatforms. Referencing sensors on a manipulator to a common coordinate system\ndepends on the accurate calibration of\nmanipulator kinematics, which Is extremely difficult. Inherent physical constraints\nhave also made it difficult to determine\nwhere each manipulator is with respect\nto another, as in the case of the system\'s\nvision arm.\nThese difficulties have had a Significant\nimpact upon several system functional\ncomponents. For example, ad-hoc (i.e.,\nengineered) methods have been employed to maintain the consistency of the\nsystem\'s data base.\nThe authors have concluded that the\ndesign of future large-scale robotic systems must include features that permit\nthe system\'s calibration in a complete\nand coherent fashion. In particular, accommodations must be made to facilitate\nthe accurate identification of device spatial relationships in terms of both hard\xc2\xb7\nware and software.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Planning. The planning of telerobot processes (i.e., actions such as move, grasp,\nand rotate) presented special problems\nbecause of the complex and interacting\nnature of a very large number of problem\nconstraints and characteristics. Among\nthese were the usual constraints arising\nfrom the kinematic construction of the\nPuma 560 manipulators, which limited\nmanipulability over large regions. P\xc2\xa3lded\nto these were spatial constraints in the\nform of interarm collision avoidance for\nthe three arms, amyfobject collision av0idance, objecqobject interference avoidance during manipulation, and object oc\xc2\xb7\nclusion during vision operations. Dynamic\nconstraints included performance degradation and even instability of compliant\nmotion operations near singular arm configurations, and poorly I<nc1vvn gravity and\nfriction effects.\nThe challenge in planning became\nthat of trying to blend engineered solu\xc2\xb7\ntions successfully with algorithmic approaches. Because a standard rule or\nlogic-based planning system would have\nbeen very difficult to design, an altemative\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 1991\n\n\\\\\\}tJtJ\\~\\l CASES FOR\n\nSENSITIVE ELECTRONICS\nPtultlvt\n\nfl\xc2\xb7, "/0\n\n&sto",.rle IIroct m\n\n.\n\nProvide controlled shock and\nvibration levels.

This approach utilized actionselection rules and procedures based on\na partial handling of the various constraints to generate candidate actions.\nDetailed world-model~riven simulation of\nthe action was then used to accept or\nreject the candidate action.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Architecture. In a well-established and\n-understood field, the construction of a\nsystem without first exploring its formulation and design in great detail is foolhardy. Unfortunately, this rigor is not fea\xc2\xb7\nsible in a research environment where\nrequirements fluctuate. In these situations,\nsuccess is often determined by the ability to react rapidly to significant design\nchanges.\nFirst, it was observed that space telerobotics is not a highly structured task\nand that efforts should be placed on the\nreactive, feedback portion of the architecture that allows the robot to respond to\nthe environment.\nSecond, interface "bllndspots," whereby higher-level subsystems are unable to\ncommand all of the actions that the hardware devices can perform, must be cooided at all costs because they inevitably lie\nprecisely in the regions that turn out to\nbe crucial to the functioning of the overall\nsystem.\n\nThird, the ability to shift functionality\neasily across subsystem interfaces is crucial as the development of new algorithms with improved functionality can\nforce the shifting of large bodies of capability from higher-level subsystems to\nlower ones.\nFourth, the practice of inserting additionallayers into implementations for the\nexpress purpose of decoupling external\nusers from the internal details of a piece\nof software (i.e., abstraction) is essential\nduring the development of subsystem in\xc2\xb7\nterfaces because such practice prevents\nminor internal modifications from being\npropagated to other subsystems.\nRnally, the most important issue in large\nsystems\' software development is human\nrather than technological. Frequent, detailed communication among all members of a development team is required\nto prevent minor choices on the part of\nsubsystems from propagating disastrous\xc2\xb7\nIy to the system.\nThis work was done by Henry W Stone,\nJ.

The\nexperiment was conducted to learn more\nabout the jumping, blurring, flickering, and\nmultiple lines that an observer perceives\nwhen a line moves at high speed across\nthe screen of a calligraphic CRT.\nA horizontal line on an oscilloscope dis\xc2\xb7\nplay was moved vertically at various speeds\nand viewed by SENeraI OOservers. The lmm\nthick line approximates the lines used on\n19- to 21-in. (48-to 53-<:m) cathode-ray tubes\nin flight-simulation visual displays. The line\nwas refreshed at a rate of either once or\ntwice per update. A line that is refreshed\nonce per update is drawn on the screen\nonce. Its position is then recomputed (updated), and it is redrawn . A line that is refreshed twice per update is drawn on the\nscreen twice in one position, its position\nis recomputed, and it is then redrawn twice\nin the next poSition. Lines are frequently\nrefreshed more often than they are updated to avoid flickering .\nThe report presents data from the observations on plots of rates of refreshing\nand updating as functions of speed. The\nspeed above which the picture appears to\ndeteriorate can be found from such a plot.\nThis speed can be related by calculations\nto simulated angular and linear velocities\nof the aircraft in the flight simulator.\nFor example, a visual display updated\nat 30 hertz and refreshed at 60 hertz appears to deteriorate at angular and linear\nvelocities considerably less than those of\nmodern high-performance aircraft. However, the speed at which deterioration appears to set in can be increased significantly by increasing the update rate.\nRefreshing at twice the update rate produces only minor improvement. To display\nrapidly changing flight scenery without apparent deterioration of the image, it may\nbe necessary to use an updating rate of\nat least several hundred hertz.\nThis work was done by Gary V.

Alabama\n\n,\nA semiempirical mathematical model\npredicts the deposition of soot in a tubular\ngas generator in which hydrocarbon fuel\nis burned in a very-fuel-rich mixture (equivalence ratio of the order of 10) with pure\noxygen. The model was developed in response to concern over the deposition of\nsoot in the gas generators and turbomachinery of rocket engines. The model may\nalso be of interest in terrestrial applications\nthat involve fuel-rich combustion or analogous processes; e.g., the purposeful deposition of soot to manufacture carbon\nblack pigments.\nPreviously, the deposition of soot in rocket gas generators was studied by making\ncrude empirical correlations between\nmeasurements of differential pressures\nand inferred measurements of soot. In\ncontrast, this model is based on the physics of aerosols and is meant to be calibrated by corre:lation with direct measurements of the formation and deposition of\nsoot. including measurements of the scattering of laser light from soot and laser\nmeasurements of flow fields. Once so calibrated, the model is expected to be gen\xc2\xb7\nerally applicable to gas generators of various configurations.\nThe principal mechanisms in the model\nare (1) inception of the solid soot particles\nfrom gaseous products of combustion, (2)\n\nthe increase in the sizes and masses of\nsoot particles that results from surface reactions with gas-phase hydrocarbons, and\n(3) deposition via thermophoresis (the\ntransfer of mass down a gradient of temperature). The first and most important\nequation of the model is the one that accounts for the volume fraction of soot (the\nvolume of soot per unit volume of flow) as\na function of time. The right side of this\nequation consists of a term that accounts\nfor inception and a term that accounts for\ngrowth. This equation can be used to calculate the volume fraction of soot as a\nfunction of poSition along the axis of a gas\ngenerator by assuming that the flow is onedimensional and converting the time variable to the equivalent axial DOsition.\nThe two critical variables in the equation are the rate of inception of particles\n(which is a function of injector mixing) and\nthe rate of growth of soot on the surfaces\nof the particles. These variables were\nchosen because they can be quantified\nempirically via laser measurements of the\nsoot and flow field.\nThe second major equation of the model is the one that accounts for the gross\ndeposition of soot particles from the flow\nonto the wall. This equation uses well-defined correlations among local coefficients\nfor the transfer of heat and mass to deter-\n\nImproved Gas-Gap Heat Switch\nResidual conductance in the "off" state is reduced.\n\nNASA\'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, California\nFour modifications in the design of a\ngas-gap heat switch decrease its residual\nthermal conductance in the "off" state,\nthereby making it act more nearly like a\ntrue on/off switch. Gas-gap heat switches\nare used in cryogenic systems; for example, to connect and disconnect redundant\ncoolers with a single load. Gas-gap heat\nswitches have no moving parts and, therefore, offer reliability and long operating life.\nIn a gas-gap heat switch of the type\ndescribed here (see\'figure), the gap is the\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 1991\n\nspace between interdigitating fins and\nslots machined into lengthwise-mating\ncopper cylinders. The copper cylinders are\nsealed in a supporting stainless-steel tube,\nand the gap is made much less thermally\nconductive (the switch is turned "off") by\nevacuating it. The gap is made more thermally conductive (the switch is turned\n"on") by filling the evacuated gap with\nneon, nitrogen, hydrogen, helium, or other\nsuitable gas from a gas-adsorption pump.\nThe gas-adsorption pump could be, for ex-\n\n~ine the local coefficie~ts f~r the d~posi-\n\n~~\n\ntIon of soot. One factor In thiS equation is\nthe volume fraction of soot calculated in\n\nthe first equation: The coeffi~i~nt for the\ntransfer of mass In the depoSition of soot\nis found by using the conventional analogy\nbetween the transfers of heat and mass\nand accounting for thermophoresis. The\nthermophoretic influence on deposition is\ncharacterized by the ratio between the\ntemperature of the wall and the temperature of the free-stream part of the flow.\nThe amount of soot ultimately deposited\non the wall is calculated as the difference\nbetween the gross amount deposited (calculated as described above) and the\namount of previously deposited soot that\nis sheared off the wall by the flow. The\nequation for the fraction sheared off is\nbased on a semiempirical soot-Iayer-adhesion-strength criterion that has been\nfound to be accurate in studies of the\nadhesion of dust and includes an assumed\nlog-normal distribution of the force requi red to remove a particle of soot from\nthe surface. The force that causes the\nremoval of soot is assumed to correspond\nto the wall shear stress.\nThis work was done by Darby B. Makel\nof Aerojet TechSystems for Marshall\nSpace Flight Center.

At such large\ndifferences in temperature. the residual\nconductance in the "off" state caused by\nparasitic radiation across the gap and conductance in the supporting cylinder can\nresult in unacceptably high transfer of heat\nacross the nominally "off" switch. In addition, differences among the thermal expansions of the hot and cold copper cylinders and the stainless-steel supporting\ncylinder can result in contact between the\ntips of fins and the bottoms of slots, with\n49\n\nToG \xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\nSupply\n\nPortable Blackbody Calibration\nSource features high emissivity\n& remarkable accuracy of 0.05%1\n\nT~~\n\nNIST\nTraceable\n\nt\n\n..

Whereas the gas flowed in and out\n\nthrough passages in both the hot and\ncold sides in the previous version, the\nmodified version includes passages on\nthe hot side only.

The apparatus\nwould have few moving parts. It would also\ncontain no syringes, which are difficult to\nclean, load, and unload and which can introduce contaminant silicone grease into\nthe crystallization solution. After the growth\nof the crystals was terminated, the specimens could be retrieved and transported\nsimply.\nThe apparatus (see figure) would be a\n12- by 8- by 2-cm transparent, polycarbonate tray assembly that would contain\n24 crystal-growth chambers, each 15 mm\nin diameter and 16 mm deep. Centered\nwithin each chamber would be a movable\npedestal (piston), a guide sleeve, and an\nO-ring seal. At the tip of each pedestal\n(piston), there would be a depression, 3\nmm deep and 5 mm in diameter, that\nwould serve as a crystal-growth compartment. Each such depression could contain up to 0.1 mL of the protein/precipitant\nmixture.\nThe sleeves and O-rings would allow the\npedestals to move vertically approximately\n3 mm while maintaining the seals among\nthe chambers. The 4-mm annulus formed\nby the walls of the chambers and the\npedestal would serve as the reservoir for\nthe precipitant solution. A doughnut-shaped\nwick of high-molecular-weight polyethylene\nor other porous material would fit into the\nannulus to contain the precipitant solution\nand to provide adequate surface area for\nthe vapor-equilibration crystal-growth process to occur.\nUnder normal conditions, a protein/precipitant solution would be placed in the\ncrystal-growth compartment in each pedestal while the precipitant solution was\nadded to the annulus containing the\nporous wick. The solutions in the tray assembly would then rapidly be frozen to a\ntemperature of - 150 \xc2\xb0C or lower and remain frozen until the experiment was activated.

In\nthis configuration, growth would be initiated when the ganging mechanism moved\nthe pedestals away from the cover, thus\nallowing communication between the\ncrystal-growth compartments and the\nprecipitants. Growth would be terminated\nby using the ganging mechanism to move\nthe pedestals back into the original sealed\nposition .

However, in this\ncase, the angle of the mirrors and, therefore, the wavelength of peak transmission\n(via Bragg reflection from the mirrors)\nwould be made adjustable.\nThe scanning monochromator (see\nfigure) could include one or more pairs of\nparallel mirrors on two or more substrates.\nThe facing surfaces of the substrates in\neach pair would be coated with identical\nBragg-reflecting multilayers.

A motor would turn\na lead screw in a threaded way on the\nhousing of the monochromator.

Because each facing pair\nof mirror surface could be coated with a different Braggreflecting multilayer. each pair of mirrors could cover a\ndifferent range of wavelengths.

As in other accelerated-aging\nmethods, the objective is to determine\nquickly what the operating life of tested\ncomponents would be under normal operating conditions by extrapolation from lifetime measurements at operating stresses\ngreater than normal. The design of an accelerated test involves a compromise between (1) reducing the testing time by increasing the stresses and (2) reducing the\nuncertainty in the extrapolated lifetime by\ndecreasing the stresses.\nIn the case of electromigration, the\nstresses are the applied electrical current\nand the temperature. The median time to\nfailure, t, is used as the measure of operating life and is assumed to be approximated\nby\nt AI -n exp{E/kT)\nwhere A and n are constants, I is current,\nEa is an activation energy, k is Boltzmann\'s\nconstant, and T is the absolute temperature. This equation is first linearized by taking the natural logarithm of both sides,\nthen applied to tests at different currents\nand temperatures. A minimum of three different combinations of current and temperature are necessary for the determination\nof n, Ea, and the value of t extrapolated\nto normal operating current and temperature.\nThe selection of currents and temperatures for these tests is guided by linearregression and propagation-of-errors\nanalyses of the linearized equation. The\nfigure illustrates such a selection based\non the results of such an analysis.

The issues involved in the modification are not trivial, because the imaging\ntasks in the two applications are different.\nThe telescope in a laser Doppler velocimeter must focus two Gaussian-profile laser\nbeams at an intersection that defines the\nprobe volume and collect the light backscattered from the probe volume for final\nfocusing into a photodetector. The distance\nfrom the telescope to the probe volume is\ntypically of the order of ten times the focal\nlength. On the other hand, a typical commercial telescope is designed for viewing\nobjects at a distance between 50 times the\nfocal length and infinity and is not optimized\nfor the simultaneous beam-focusing and\nbackscatter-collecting functions.\nThe modification process for a given\ntelescope is subject to the following issues:\n1. Can good performance be obtained by\nsimply repositioning the optical components of the catadioptriC telescope?\n2. What are the required modifications as\na function of the f-ratio? (The f-ratio is the\ndistance between the probe volume and\nthe corrector plate of the telescope, divided by the diameter of that corrector plate.)\n3. What is the aberration limit of the modified\ntelescope as a function of the f-ratio?\n4. What is the resulting collection solid angle\nas a function of f-ratio?\n5. How well do the modified catadioptric 0ptics perform in comparison to a lens of\nsimilar design?\nThe analytical approach taken to obtain\nanswers to these questions emphasized\nthe use of a simple ray-tracing computer\nprogram to analyze modified optical configurations. The ray-tracing software also incorporated a Gauss-Newton optimization\nalgorithm, which systematically varied\ntagged parameters until successive iterations provided less than a 10- 6 improvement in a target value, typically a pointfocus specification. This feature was quite\nuseful in the optimization of the collector\nsystem. The root-mean-square blur of ray\nbundles originating at the axis vertex in the\nobject plane and converging to a best focus\nin the image plane was used as an indication of the imaging performance of the optical system. Both point-focus and confocal\nbackscatter zoom configurations were considered. Finally, a paraxial Gaussian beampropagation calculation was made to evaluate the beam-focusing function .\nThis analytical procedure was first applied to a generic, aperture-normalized\n56\n\nCorrector Plate\nLight From Star\n\nPrimary\nMirror\n\nSecondary Mirror\nCassegrain\nFocus\n\nUNMODIFIED\nPerforated\nMirror\n\n-------\'.......-----I4 f=-=-=-:=-==-=:...=.=-:=-==-=::=:::::=s:~ _\nMODIFI ED\n\nr\n\nLens\n~ Pinhole\n\nPhotodetector\n\nA Schmidt-Cassegrain Astronomical Telescope can be optimized by repositioning of its\ncomponents to focus two laser beams on a nearby probe volume and confocally collect\nlight backscattered from the probe volume.\n\nSchmidt-Cassegrain telescope that was\nbased on an average of the specifications\nof several commercial units. The results\nof the computation showed that very good\nperformance could be obtained for f-ratios\nas low as 4.0. Two relatively simple alternative modification procedures were found\nto maintain diffraction-limited imaging\nperformance:\n1. The three active elements (primary mirror, secondary mirror, and corrector plate)\nmay be independently repoSitioned (see\nfigure). This requires a lengthening of the\ntelescope tube and modification of the\nsecondary mirror mount.\n2. The primary mirror may be relocated, and\nthe secondary mirror may be replaced.\nThis again requires a lengthening of the\ntube and replacement of the secondary\nmirror with a Btock convex mirror or with\na reflectively coated lens of the correct\ncurvature.\nThe predicted performance of these\nmodified telescope systems was compared with the predicted performance of\nlarge-aperture commercial lenses. The\nprobe-volume imaging capability of the\nmodified telescopes was found to be\nsuperior to that of the lenses for both monochromatic and dichromatic operation. Because of the central obstruction of the\nsecondary mirror and the separation of the\nprimary mirror from the corrector plate, the\ncollection solid angle of the modified telescopes was considerably less than that of\n\na lens of equivalent aperture, particularly\nat low f-ratio. However, the excellent imaging capabilities and large apertures of the\nmodified telescopes offset this limitation.\nThe modified telescope (see figure) was\nalso predicted to focus laser beams quite\nwell. The negative-secondary-mirror/positive-primary-mirror combination provided\na very small (high-energy-density) beam\nwaist near the probe volume. The beamwaist and beam-intersection points were\npredicted not to coincide (as is generally\nthe case in dual-beam laser velocimetry).\nHowever, this deficiency may be treated\nwith additional optics upbeam of the beam\nsplitter to adjust the beam-waist location.\nThese promising predictions were tested\nin a laboratory. A 200-mm-aperture telescope was purchased and modified to the\npredicted optimum configuration for both\npoint collection and dual-beam focusing.\nMeasurements of the imaging resolution\nand of the diameter and location of the\nbeam waist agreed well with the predictions.\nThis work was done by Stephen E.\nDunagan of Ames Research Center.

This facility would primarily make repeated observations of the\napparent positions of each of 127 selected\nstars with respect to distant reference\nstars in the same field of view known to\nhave unperturbed proper motions. The\npurpose of these observations is to detect\nmotions of the selected stars about cen\xc2\xb7\nters of mass and to analyze the harmonic\ncontent of the motions to infer the existence, number, masses, and orbital radii of\nplanets.\nThe preliminary concept of the system\nand the associated aiming-schedule algorithm must reflect both observational requirements based on the need to gather\nsufficient scientific data and restrictions on\nthe observations posed by the instrument\nitself, the other equipment on the Space\nStation, and the motions of natural celestial\nbodies. To achieve scientifically meaningful results, it will be necessary to make 20\nto 50 complete observations of each star\nduring 20 years. Each complete observation will be synthesized from all the data\n(representing about 108 collected photons)\non each selected star and its reference\nstars to produce one measurement of DDsition and may require tens of hours of\nviewing the same selected star in nonperOOic intervals of about 13 min each.\nSome of the complicating factors are\nthe foUONing:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 To reduce contamination of the telescope\noptics by impinging particles, the telescq:l9 must not be aimed within 00 0 of the\norbital velocity.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Cb;ervations cannot be made during orbital-reboost and Space-Shuttle-docking\nmaneuvers.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The telesccpe must avoid the SUn and reflections of SUnlight from the Earth, Moon,\nand parts of the Space Station. The telescope also cannot view stars that are tenr\nporarily obscured by these bod\'l9S.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The viewing time must be allocated fairly\namong all targets, taking account of such\nfactors as the viewing time already allocatNASA Tech Briefs, Augusl1991\n\ned to each star, the need to observe fainter\nstars during longer intervals, and the statistical decrease in brightnesses of stars\nwith increasing galactic latitude.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The available viewing time is reduced by\nthe time required to turn the telescope\nfrom one target to another, plus a 15-sec\xc2\xb7\nand settling time after each change of target.\nTo obtain a preliminary indication of\ncapabilities of the system, computer simulations were conducted, taking into ac\xc2\xb7\ncount the constraints on the telescope, the\nscience requirements, the orbital mechanics of the Space Station, and the telescopeaiming maneuvers during 20 years. The\nsimulations included a "baseline" system\nconcept and modified versions obtained by\nimposing the various constraints as parameters.\nThe simulations shQ\\Ned that the facility\nshould be able to provide each of the 127\nstars with a viewing time (normalized with\nrespect to the dependence of brightness\non celestial latitude to an equivalent time\nfor a star seen at the ceiestial equator) of\nabout 24 hours per year. Because stars at\nlarge galactiC latitudes require inordinate\nviewing times, longer normalized viewing\ntimes might be obtained by selecting tar\xc2\xb7\ngets closer to the galactic equator.\nUnder the "baseline" constraints, the\nfacility should be able to view all regions of\nthe sky during its lifetime, spending about\n79 percent of Its time viewing stars. The imposition of more severe constraints decreases this performance figure only\nslightly. Thus, it appears that the efficiency\nof the facility can be high and that there\nmay be time available for other astrophysical investigations.\nThis work was done by Alfred C.

Analyses of the type presented here\nwill be important in the design of thermal\nprotection for such vehicles.\n\nOn the basis of previous studies of the\nproposed hypersonic flight regime, the\ndominant mechanisms of transfer of heat\nto the surface are known to be conduc\xc2\xb7\ntion and convection (radiation is neglected). In addition. when dissociated atoms\nfrom hot boundary-layer gases reach the\nrelatively cool surface, they can recombine\nand release their energy of formation directly to the surface. Therefore, the chemi\xc2\xb7\ncal reactivity or catalyticity of the surface\nmaterial can affect heating, and these\nchemical effects are taken into account\nin this study.\nThe study involves the use and comparison of two methods of analysis: approximate equations based on similarity\ntheory, and a numerical simulation via the\nnonsimilar, reactive-boundary\xc2\xb7layer mathematical model embodied in the BLlMPK\ncomputer program. The governing equations are presented as conservation laws\nin a two-dimensional axisymmetric coor\xc2\xb7\ndinate system fixed to the body with the\norigin at the stagnation point. These equations are supplemented by mechanical\nand calorical equations of state and by\nboundary conditions. The Levy-Lees transformation is applied to the equations,\ngrouping dominant effects into specific\nterms and putting the equations into forms\nmore suitable for both algebraiC approximation and numerical integration.\nBoth methods of analysis are applied\nto the stagnation region of a sphere/cone\nblunt body under the operating conditions\nthat are expected to result in the maximum\nheating of a representative aerospace ve\xc2\xb7\nhicle during ascent. The heat fluxes computed by the two methods are compared.\nThe effects of injection of pure nitrogen,\nhelium, and argon on the heat flux and the\ndistributions of molecular species in the\nboundary layer are also presented. It is\nshown how the numerical results from\nBUMPK can be used to develop a correlation between the coefficients for the transfer of heat in the presence of transpiration\nand the coefficients for the transfer of heat\nobtained from similarity theory. This provides both a test of the validity of the\nsimilarity theory and a means of using it\nrapidly and easily to approximate flows that\ndeviate only slightly from the similarity\ntheory.\nThis work was done by William D.\nHenline of Ames Research Center.

The grease apparently protects the\nbore and its corner radii from corrosioninitiating and -accelerating substances like\nmoisture and contaminants, which can\nenter during assembly. Previously, stresscorrosion cracking in the bore has been\nprevented by either (1) maintaining the bore\nclean and extensively purging and drying\nit, all requiring 72 hours of assembly time,\nor (2) shot-peening and nickel-plating the\nbore, at a cost of $658 per bearing (1989\n\nInner Races of ball-bearing assemblies\nwere tested for resistance to stresscorrosion cracking by shrink-fitting them\nonto a mandrel, applying saltwater, and exposing them to a humid environment.\n\nprices). The principal advantages of coating with the special grease are that unlike\nthe previous methods, it is relatively inexpensive (about $5 per bearing) and involves very little extra assembly time.\nThe efficacy of the grease-coating method was demonstrated in a simple experiment. Three inner races of 44DC stainless\nsteel were prepared. One race was left uncoated, the bore and corner radii of the\nsecond race were coated with Braycote\n640 AC-MS grease, and the bore and corner radii of the third race were coated with\nKrytox grease with a strontium nitrate additive. The races were installed on a meIybdenum-coated mandrel (see figure) with\nan interference fit at a hoop stress of 45\nkpsi (310 MPa) by initially shrinking the\nmandrel in liquid nitrogen, then sliding the\nraces onto the mandrel while it was still\ncold.\nDuring the brief interval between removal from the liquid-nitrogen bath and the\ninstallation of the races, moisture condensed from the atmosphere onto the\nmandrel. When the mandrel warmed up\nand expanded into contact with the bores\nof the races, the moisture was trapped between the bores and the mandrel. Any pitting (caused, for example, by corrosion initiated by the trapped moisture) near the\ncorner radii would concentrate the already\nhigh hoop stress and might thereby cause\nthe ring to fracture.\nThe shaft and races were placed in a\nhumid environment and a 3-percent saltwater solution was applied to accelerate\ncorrosion. The uncoated race failed in 7\nhours. The greased races lasted more\nthan a month and had not yet failed when\nthe results of the experiment were recorded.\nThis Vt/Ork was done by Robert F.

SOL includes the mathematical modeling and\nlogical capabilities of a computer language\nlike FORTRAN but also includes the additional power of nonlinear mathematical programming methods ~.e., numerical optimization) at the language level (as opposed\nto the subroutine leveQ.\nThe language-level use of optimization\nhas several advantages over the traditional, subroutine-calling method of using an\noptimizer: first, the optimization problem\nis described in a concise and clear manner that closely parallels the manner of the\nmathematical description of the optimization; second, a seamless interface is automatically established between the opti59\n\nmizer subroutines and the mathematical\nmodel of the system being optimized; third,\nthe results of an optimization (objective,\ndesign variables, constraints, termination\ncriteria, and some or all of the optimization history) are put out in a form directly\nrelated to the description of the optimization; and finally, automatic checking for errors and recovery from an ill<lefined model\nof the system or description of the optimization are facilitated by the language-level\nspecification of the optimization problem.\nThus, SOL enables rapid generation of\nmodels and solutions for optimum design\nproblems with greater confidence that the\nproblem is posed correctly.\nThe SOL compiler takes SOL-language\nstatements and generates the equivalent\nFORTRAN code and system calls. Because of this approach, the modeling capabilities of SOL are extended by the ability to incorporate existing FORTRAN code\ninto a SOL program. In addition, SOL has\na powerful MACRO capability. The MACRO\ncapability of the SOL compiler effectively\ngives the user the ability to extend the SOL\nlanguage and can be used to develop easyto-use shorthand methods of generating\ncomplex models and solution strategies.\nThe SOL compiler provides syntactic and\nsemantic checking for recovery from errors and provides detailed reports containing cross-references to show where each\nvariable was used. The lists summarize all\n\noptimizations and include the objective\nfunctions, design variables, and constraints.\nThe compiler checks for errors specific to\noptimization problems, so that simple mistakes will not cost hours of debugging time.\nThe optimization engine used by and included with the SOL compiler is a version\nof Vanderplatt\'s ADS system (Version 1.1)\nmodified specifically to work with the SOL\ncompiler. SOL allows the use of the more\nthan 100 ADS optimization choices; for example, sequential quadratic programming,\nmodified feasible directions, interior- and\nexterior-penalty-function methods, and\nvariable-metric methods. Default choices\nof the many control parameters of ADS are\nmade for the user, but the user can override any of the ADS control parameters for\neach individual optimization.\nThe SOL language and compiler were\ndeveloped with an advanced compilergeneration system to ensure correctness\nand simplify the maintenance of programs.\nThus, the syntax of SOL was defined precisely by a LALR(1) grammar, and the\nparser of the SOL compiler was generated\nautomatically from the LALR(1) grammar\nwith a parser generator. Hence, unlike in\nad-hoc, manually coded interfaces, the lexical analysis of the SOL compiler ensures\nthat the SOL compiler recognizes all legal\nSOL programs, can recover from and correct for many errors, and can report the\nlocation of errors to the user.\n\nThis version of the SOL compiler has\nbeen implemented on VIV<JVMS computer\nsystems and requires 204 KB of virtual\nmemory to execute. Inasmuch as the SOL\ncompiler produces FORTRAN code, it requires the VfV< FORTRAN compiler to produce an executable program. The SOL\ncompiler consists of 13,000 lines of Pascal\ncode. It was developed in 1986 and last\nupdated in 1988.

The data\nare presented as a series of overlays on\ntop of a two-dimensional or three-dimensional projection of the Earth. Included are\nspacecraft-orbit tracks, ground-station-antenna masks, solar and lunar ephemerides,\nand coverage by the Tracking Data and\nRelay Satellite System (mASS). From these\ngraphical representations, an analyst can\ndetermine such spacecraft-related constraints as communication coverage, infringement upon zones of interference,\navailability of sunlight, and visibility of\ntargets to instruments.\nThe presentation of time and geometric\ndata as graphical overlays on a world map\nmakes possible quick analyses of trends\nand time-oriented parameters. With the\nthree-dimensional display, the user specifies a vector that represents the position\nin the universe from which the user wishes\nto view the Earth. From these "viewpoint"\nparameters the user can zoom in on or\nrotate around the Earth. The zoom feature\nis also available with the two-dimensional\nmap image. The program contains data\nfiles of world-map continent coordinates,\ncontour information, antenna-mask coordinates, and a sample star catalog .\nInasmuch as the overlays are designed\nto be independent of any particular mission, no software modifications are required to satisfy the different requirements\nof various spacecraft. All overlays are generic, with the contours of communication\nzones and spacecraft terminators generated analytically based on data on the\naltitude of the spacecraft. Contours of\nzones of interference are specified by the\nuser through text-edited data files. Spacecraft-orbit tracks are specified via Keplerian or Cartesian orbit vectors. Finally, all\ntime-related overlays are based on an\nepoch supplied by the user.\nA user-interface subsystem of the software system enables the user to alter any\nparameter of the system that affects a mission or that affects the graphics through\na series of pull-down menus and pop-up\ndata-entry panels. The user can specify\nand load mission-data files, control graphical-presentation formats, and terminate\nthe system. The interface automatically\nchecks for errors in, and validates, all data\nput into the system from either a file or\nthe keyboard. A help software facility is\nprovided.\nMPGT also includes a software utility\ncalled ShowMPGT. which displays screen\nimages that were gen9rated and saved\nwith the MPGT system.

The more conventional\npressure, density, and velocity-vector maps\noften do not adequately represent the vortical features of interest and sometimes\ngive ambiguous indication of swirl direction. In contrast, the helicity-density and\nnormalized-helicity representations emphasize the complicated and, therefore, important parts of a flow field, identify the vortexes, differentiate between primary and\nsecondary vortexes, indicate the sense of\nthe swirling motion, locate the free singular\npoints (those not attached to surfaces), and\ntrace the vortex-core streamlines that\nemanate from these points.\nThe helicity density is defined as the\nscalar product of the velocity and vorticity\nvectors at a given location in the flow field.\nThe normalized helicity is defined as the\ninner product of the unit vectors along the\nvelocity and vorticity directions; that is, the\nnormalized helicity is the cosine of the\nangle between the velocity and the vorticity. One of the great advantages of the helicity density and the normalized helicity is that\nboth their magnitudes and their senses are\nmeaningful. A large helicity density reflects\na large velocity and a large vorticity when\nthe angle between them is small. The sign\nof the helicity density indicates the direction of swirl of the vortex relative to the\nvelocity. Both the relative size of the helic1ty density and the changing of swirl direction, emphasized by graduation in color for\nmagnitude and by different colors for positive or negative values, facilitate the distinction between primary and secondary\nvortexes in a graphical representation (see\nFigure 1).\nThe effectiveness of the helicity density\nas an indicator of vortexes is even much\ngreater for low-subsonic flows, for which\nthe conventional density mapping is not\nsufficiently sensitive because the variations\nin density are almost negligible. The sensitivity of the helicity-density representation\nremains high because in the core regions\n62\n\nof the vortexes, both the velocity and vorticity always reach relatively high values\nand the angle between them is small. All\nthese contribute to high values of the helicity density and to a clear representation of\nthe vortexes.\nFigure 2 shows the components of the\nvorticity vectors relative to a local streamline. One component is parallel to the local\nvelocity vector, and the other two are perpendicular to it. The component parallel to\nthe velocity, which is the only component\nthat contributes to the helicity density, van-\n\nishes everywhere in a two-dimensional\nflow. It also vanishes wherever the flow is\nlocally two dimensional, as on planes of\nsymmetry. Therefore, the normalized helicity must be zero in two-dimensional flows\nand must vanish locally on planes of symmetry, thus emphasizing them in the\ngraphical representation.\nEach of the two components of vorticity perpendicular to the velocity is responsible for the curvature of the streamline in\nthe plane that is perpendicular to it and includes the velocity vector. When these two\nperpendicular components decrease relative to a constant parallel component, the\n\nPrimary\nVortex\n\nFigure 1. A Primary and a Secondary Vortex can be seen clearly in th is plot of helicitydensity contours in a cross section of the computed flow field about an og ive/cyllnder\nbody.

In the limiting case, where the\nvelocity and vorticity vectors are parallel ,\nthe normalized helicity is exactly equal to\nunity, and the streamline is locally straight.\nHowever, the flow is far from being two\ndimenSional, because adjacent streamlines spiral around this streamline. The fact\nthat the normalized helicity goes to its maximum value on a streamline of minimum\ncurvature can be used to locate a vortex\xc2\xb7\ncore axis, which is such a streamline.\n\nThis work was done by David Degani of\n\nAmes Research Center and Yuva/ Levy\nand Arnan Seginer of Israel Institute of\nTechnology.

It could\nalso be used in mining and for transferring liquids.\nThe natural instabilities of streams leaving nozzles frequently cause the streams\nto disperse relatively close to the nozzles.\nAlthough a previously developed advanced\nnozzle produces a more-coherent issuing\nstream, it functions optimally at only one\nupstream pressure or rate of flow. The new\nchoke, based partly on the previous nozzle concept, helps to maintain the coherence of the flow over a range of pressures and rates of flow.\nThe self-adjusting choke is a relatively\nthick, flexible membrane that contains,\ntypically, three orifices, the outer two of\nwhich are slanted (see figure). The membrane is inserted into the opening of the\nnozzle. When the rate of flow is low and\nthe membrane is not much distorted by\nthe upstream pressure of the fluid, the liquid issuing from the outer orifices tends\nto separate into two diverging streams.\nSimultaneously, the web of fluid issuing\n\nCIrcte Reeder Action No. 881\n\nLOW fLOW\n\nHIGH now\n\nA Flexible Membrane With Slanted Orifices\ndeforms according to the upstream pressure in\nthe flowing liquid, producing a more-coherent\nspiraling stream.\n\nfrom the middle orifice tends to pull the\ndiverging streams together.

Hampton, Virginia\nThe visible indication of the transition\nof a boundary layer from laminar to turbulent flow plays an important role in aerodynamic tests in wind tunnels and in flight.\nThe most popular methods for making\nboundary layers visible in such tests have\nincluded the sublimating-chemical technique and the oil-flow technique. However,\neach method has limitations that constrain\nits applicability. In a newly developed method, liquid-crystal coats are used to make\nvisible such features of boundary-layer\nflows as transitions, separations, and the\nlocations of shocks.\nypically, temperature and shear stress\nT\nare the primary stimuli in response to which\nliquid-crystal coats selectively reflect discrete wavelengths (colors) of light. 8ecause the fundamental chemical structure\nis unaffected by these changes, a liquidcrystal coat can respond repeatably to the\nsame physical changes. Thus, the color\nchanges can be reversible.\nLiquid-crystal coats can respond very\nrapidly to changes in shear stresses or\ntemperature distributions; characteristic\nresponse times as small as 0.2 second\nhave been observed. The particular color\nobserved depends on the viewing angle\nand on the local shear and temperature\nto which the liquid crystals are subjected.\nThe vividness and brilliance of the reflected colors also depend on the amount and\nangle of incident light.\nOne flight evaluation of the Iiquid-crystal\ntechnique was conducted on a Lear Model\n28/29 business jet airplane operated by\nNASA at its Langley Research Center in\nresearch on the reduction of viscous drag.\nThe airplane prOllides, for research, an extensive combination of ranges of flight 0perating conditions, including mach numbers up to 0.805, maximum unit Reynolds\nnumbers up to 2.65X1OS ft-1 (8.69X1OS\nm-1), and altitudes up to 51,000 ft (15.6\nkm). The right wing let of the airplane was\nprepared for testing by coating it with a\nliquid-crystal mixture.\nCorrelations between transitions measNASA Tech Briefs. August 1991\n\nured by hot films and by liquid crystals\nshowed that the change in the color of the\nliquid-crystal coat corresponded to the first\nappearance of turbulent spots in the hot\nfilms. This response differs from that of\nsublimating chemicals, which show the\nend of the transition region_\nThe time-dependent response of a liquid-crystal coat was also evaluated. The\ntransition on the wing let was changed by\nconducting sideslip oscillations with a period of about 2 cycles per second. The\nobserved movement of the transition was\nin phase with the sideslip oscillation, indicating that the coat responded rapidly.\nAnother flight experiment invoMng liquid\ncrystals was conducted with a Grumman\nOV-18 Mohawk airplane operated by\nNASA. In addition, a test of both liquidcrystal and sublimating-chemical indications of transitions was conducted in the\nLangley 14-by-22-ft (4.3- by-6.7-m) wind\ntunnel on a fuselage forebody. Comparison\nof the results showed good agreement between the two methods.\nThe use of liquid-crystal coats in the\nmeasurement of transitions provides data\nthat can be very difficult to acquire by\nother visualization techniques. For flight\napplications, liquid crystals provide the\ncapability for making transitions visible\nthroughout almost the entire altitude and\nspeed ranges of subsonic aircraft. The use\nof liquid crystals is not known to expose\nhumans to any hazard of toxicity. Because\nliquid crystals are derived from the fatty\nacids of animals, they tend to be less hazardous than many other chemicals are.\nThe liquid-crystal method is also applicable\nto the visible indication of supersonic f10ws\nand is suitable for general use in high- and\nlow-speed wind-tunnel and water-tunnel\ntesting.\nThis \'WOrk was done tJy Bruce J Holmes\nof Langley Research Center and Clifford\nJ.

An extension of a method\ndeveloped previously for two-dimensional\nflows, this method is based in part on the\nanalogy of a fictitious system of tension\nand torsion springs that connect the grid\npoints (see Figure 1).\nThe stiffnesses of the springs can be\nspecified in terms of some measures of\nthe flow-field characteristics (density,\nmach number, and the like) or in terms of\nparameters computed on the grid itself. By\nspecifying minimum and maximum permissible spacings, the grid can be said to\nbe "self-adaptive" or " solution-adaptive"\n(see Figure 2), and iterative adaptionS/solutions can be performed in the effort to\nachieve a desired convergence.\nAn adaptation involves the use of variational principles to minimize the potential\nenergy stored in the springs. For the adaptation along one coordinate line (e.g., the\n~i. k line in Figure 1), that line is held fixed\nwhile each grid point on the line is allowed\nto move freely along it in response to the\ntugs of the tension springs that connect\nit to the two adjacent grid points on the\nsame line and to the twists of the torsion\nsprings that connect it to the adjacent grid\npoints on the adjacent lines that represent\nthe same (e.g., J;) coordinate. For a three-dimensional adaptation, the procedure is\nsplit into a sequence of adaptations, each\nalong one coordinate axis at a time.\nA user-friendly computer research code\nhas been written to implement the adaptive-grid algorithm. In response to the maximum and minimum grid spacings specified by the user, the code automatically\ncalculates most of the incorporated grid\nparameters, which affect orthogonality and\nsmoothness. The user selects the direc-\n\nFigu re 1. Fictitious\nSprings connecting the\npoints of the computational grid are used to\ndetermine an optimum\ngrid spacing.

This concept is\nextended here to compressible flow in\nwhich the ratio of the velocity at any given\npoint to the velocity at the centerline point\ndoes not vary with position along the pipe.\nMeasurements have confirmed that subsonic flows tend to be "fully developed" in\nthis extended sense (see figure).\nThe cross-sectional velocity profile is assumed to be similar to a flat-plate boundarylayer profile:\nu/u c\n\nCAJON Products\nfor Vacuwn Service. \xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\nIMMEDIATE delivery from local stocks\nFlexible Tubing\nFlexible\nGlass End Tubing\n\n= (2y/d)n\n\n=\n\nwhere u\nthe velocity at radial distance y\nfrom the wall, Uc = the velocity at the\ncenterline, and d\nthe diameter of the\npipe. The cross-sectional distribution of\ntemperature is constructed in a manner\nsimilar to the procedure normally used in\nflat-plate boundary-layer flows. The wall of\nthe pipe is assumed to be adiabatic. In this\nway, the temperature at any point in the\nflow can be expressed in terms of the ratio\nof specific heats of the flow medium, the\nmach number at the centerline, the velocity profile, and a "recovery factor" (which is\n0.88 for turbulent flows).\nThe governing equations of flow (conservation of mass, momentum, and energy) are reduced to convenient forms by introdUCing dimensionless variables and\ndefining special profile integrals of velocity\nand temperature profiles. A method is developed to solve the equations and obtain\nsolutions for values of flow friction in terms\nof measured gradients of wall static\npressure.\nThe method was used to analyze the detailed pressure measurements made in a\nlong pipe for flow of air at a wide range of\nflow speeds. Values of flow friction derived\nfrom these measurements were compared with data in the literature on Incompressible flow in pipes. The effect of the\nmach number on flow friction was then extracted from these data by applying a\nspecial procedure that isolated the effects\nof the Reynolds number and the roughness\nof the surface. The results show that the effect of the mach number in pipe flow\nfollows the trend previously established for\nflows CNer flat plates.\nThis \'NOrk was done by Frank W.

It would accommodate\nlarge misalignments between the docking\nobjects. Conceived for docking the Space\nShuttle in the Space Station, the system may\nbe useful in other applications in which a\nlarge moving object must be aligned with\nand joined to ardher - br exafTllIe. cranes,\nrobots, and fuel or material-loading lines.\nThe lightweight system would consist of\na probe on one of the two docking objects\nand a drogue on the other object. The probe\nwould contain a latching mechanism; pitch,\nroll, and yaw dampers; and centering and\nrigicflZing mechanisms (see figJre). The latching mechanism would ride on a y-axis track,\nwhich would ride on an x-axis track, which,\nin tum, would ride on a z-axis track. The probe\ncould therefore translate in the x and y directions to accept misalignment with the drogue\nand in the z direction to enter the drogue.\nThree eddy-current dampers would absorb\nthe energy of motion along the orthogonal\ndirections, bringing the docking objects to\na smooth stop.\nAccording to the concept, as the docking objects approached, the z track would\nextend the probe by 9 in. (22.9 cm). At the\nfirst contact of the probe with the drogue,\nthe x and y drives would allow such lateral\ntranslation as would be necessary to acc0mmodate misaligrvnent between the probe and\nthe drogue, and the z drive would rapidlyextend the probe deep into the drogue. Latch-\n\nes on the probe would engage the drogue.\nMeanwhile, the dampers would absorb\nkinetic energy. The probe could rotate \xc2\xb1 100\nwith respect to the x and y axes and \xc2\xb1 11 0\nwith respect to a gimbal. When motion had\nbeen stopped, a collet on the probe would\nretract to lock against pitching and yawing.\nI>ctuator-diven pILJrrJers would bel< the probe\nlatches against movement in the x, y, and\nz directions. The z-track drive would slowly\nretract the probe to its storage position.\nFor release, the probe collet would be extended, relieving the preload between the\nprobe and the drogue. The latch-locking\npiston would then be retracted, releasing\nthe spring-loaded latches. The probe would\nthen be disconnected from the drogue.\nThis work was done I:Jy Rasmik Ajemian,\nEarl V.

The conventional torsional forces are perpendicular to and proportional to their radii from the center of\ngravity of the force pattern. This superposition gives rise to a centroid from which the\nvector sums are also perpendicular to and\nproportional to their radii from this centroid.\n68\n\np\n\nStrain\nCentroid\n\nCentrOid\n\nThe centroid lies on a line through the\ncenter of gravity and perpendicular to the\ndirection of the eccentrically applied load.\nAfter the elastic limit is exceeded (the\nwheels slip on the ground), the forces redistribute until each is at its maximum\nvalue. The forces are no longer perpendicular to radii from the centroid. They shift\nto being perpendicular to radii from the\nstrain center. The strain center also lies on\nthe line through the center of gravity and\nperpendicular to the direction of the eccentrically applied load.\nThis work was done I:Jy DonaJd B Bickler\nof Caltech for NASA\'s Jet Propulsion\nLaboratory.

The most complex spacecraft involve nonlinear maneuvering (i.e.,\nlarge-angle slewing) with such articulating\nsubstructures as remote manipulating systems. Ultimately, the goal of research in\nadvanced suspension systems is to simulate flight boundary conditions (weightlessness) when testing flexible space structures on the ground. To achieve such a\ngoal, a suspension system must counteract gravitational loads while allowing a\nstructure to move without constraint. Because vibratory motion results from the\nelasticity of a flexible spacecraft, the suspension problem involves the development\nof methods of suspending spacecraft that\nhave vibratory motions superimposed on\nlarge rigid-body motions. Any suspension\ndevice must be considered as an integral\npart of the structure. However, it should\nbe designed so that the dynamics of the\ndevice interact minimally with the dynamics of the structure.\nA zero-spring-rate mechanism (ZSRM)I\nair suspension cart is being developed by\nNASA Langley Research Center. It is to be\nused to suspend flexible, "mass-critical"\narticles like lightweight spacecraft undergoing such large motions as slewing, translation, and telescoping/retraction. The ncNelty of the method and equipment is the\nability to suspend a flexible article undergoing large rigid-body motion concurrent\nwith vibratory motion, with minimal interaction between the suspended article and\nthe suspending hardware. Previous suspension devices include cable suspensions, airbags, air bearings, and cables\nwith ZSRM\'s. These devices are not designed for structures that undergo concurrent rigid-body and vibratory motions. The\nZSRM/air suspension cart is very adaptive\nto active control, which would reduce undesirable effects caused by friction, nonlinearity, and mass coupling. The ZSRM/air\nsuspension cart (see figure) is very small\ncompared to a test article and is easily\nadapted to most test facilities. Because\nno cables are needed, minimal overhead\nclearance is needed. Because this device\nis built easily, it is practical for most suspension applications.\nThe design of this device evolves from\nthe premise that as the dynamic properties of the suspension device are diminished, the dynamiC properties of the test\nstructure dominate the structure/suspension system. By combining a translational\nair bearing. a ZSRM, and a spherical air\nbearing, the design goal can be met. An\nNASA Tech Briefs. August 1991\n\nAr1 lculallng Appendage\n\n________\n\n~A~\n\n______\n\n,\n\n~\n\nc::tk===O=:::::;Ck==::a\n\n(-\n\nSuppor1 Rod --!H--~~\nNonlinear\nSide Spring\n\nZero-Sprlng\xc2\xb7\nRate Mechanism\n\nAn Articulating Appendage is\nsuspended\nfrom underneath by a\nZSRM / air\nsuspension\ncart.\n\nair bearing carries a load in translation with\nvery low friction. This air bearing allows\nthe structure to have any horizontal motion. The ZSRM, which is placed atop the\nair bearing, supports the weight of structure with minimal vertical stiffness. A\nZSRM is a negative nonlinear spring in\nparallel with a positive spring such as a\nprestressed coil spring. The negative spring\ncan be any prestressed member that provides a component of prestressed stiffness\nin the vertical direction.\nThe weight of a structure is supported\nby the main spring. A compressive side\nload is applied to the structure-attachment\npoint. When the article under test is displaced vertically from the equilibrium position of the main spring, a vertical component of the side load acts in a direction\nopposite to that of the load produced by\nthe main spring. Because the vertical\ncomponent of the side force acts in a\nsense opposite to that of the main spring,\nit behaves effectively like a negative spring.\nThis negative spring reduces the overall\nstiffness in suspending a structure. By reducing the vertical stiffness, one decreases the constraint on the motion of the\nstructure; that is, there is very little resistance to the vibratory motion of the structure. The spherical air bearing atop the\nZSRM leaves the rotational motion of the\nstructure at the point of attachment unconstrained. The overall effect of the device is that the weight of the structure is\nsupported while its motion is virtually un-\n\nconstrained. Therefore, the structure can\nbehave as though it were weightless.\nAnother basic suspension consideration\nis whether structures will be supported\noverhead or underneath. Overhead suspension is usually accomplished with cables. These are widely used, their overall\nvertical stiffnesses can be reduced with\nZSRM\'s, and they offer simplicity for ground\ntesting of structures undergoing only\nvibratory motions. Cable suspensions have\npendular and axial stiffnesses, and if they\nare used to suspend rapid slewing or articulating structures, then complicated\ncontrol devices and suspension hardware\nmust also be used. With the ZSRM/air suspension from underneath, high overhead\nheight needed for cables (to reduce pendular and axial stiffness) is not required.\nTherefore, only the size of the structure will\ndictate how tall a test facility should be.\nThough the mass of the suspension hardware couples horizontally with the structure, its dynamic effect can be easily\nmodeled analytically.\nThis \'NOrk was done by Stanley E.\nWoodard and Victor M.

In a hypersonic\nwind tunnel, the air is heated up to about\n3,000 0F (about 1,600 0c) to prevent liquefaction of the nitrogen and oxygen in the\nflow. The transducers used to measure the\npitot pressures must be protected from the\nhostile temperatures to prevent thermally\ninduced measurement errors and possible damage to the transducers. Therefore,\nthe pressure transducers are usually mounted outside of the test section, connected\nto the tips of the probes through relatively\nlong tubes. The large volume of such a\nconnecting tube causes an undesirable increase in the "settling time" of the pressure probe, the shortness of which can be\nessential to accurate measurements. Also,\na free-stream pitot pressure probe is typically mounted on the wall of a tunnel or\non an injection mechanism, and its position can be adjusted within only a limited\nrange. Accordingly, in the design of a new\ncooled. readily positionable pressure probe,\nthe transducer is mounted relatively close\nto the tip of the prot:5e.\n\nThe probe is formed of a pair of mating\ncylindrical housings: the transducer housing and the pitot-tube housing. A small hole\nis bored through the transducer housing\nalong its centerline. A hole slightly larger\nthan the body of the sensor portion of the\ntransducer is bored from one end along\nthe same line to a depth large enough to\nprovide a pressure-sensing chamber beyond the tip of the transducer. The tra[1sducer mounting post, in the vicinity of the\npressure-sensing chamber, is surrounded\nby a cooling-water annulus, which has fulldepth webbing 180 0 apart to divide it in\nhalf. It also has cross-connecting water\npassages at full depth to force the water\nto flow completely around the volume area\nto be cooled. A thermocouple sheathed\nin stainless steel is inserted from the other\nend into the pressure-sensing chamber to\nmonitor the temperature. The transducer\nhousing also contains a pressure annulus\nand a larger annulus that accommodates\na boss on the pitot-tube housing.\nThe pitot-tube housing has a pressure\nannulus that matches the boss. The pitot\npressure is delivered from the pitot tube,\n\npressure-sensing chamber via a metal\nbellows that connects the pitot tube to its\nhousing. The pitot tube is supported by an\nadjustable wedge fairing attached to the\ntop of the pitot-tube housing with a semicircular foot. This foot extends over the transducer housing with a radial clearance and\nallows the pitot tube to rotate to any orientation within 360 0 \xe2\x80\xa2\nBecause of the design of the wedge\nfairing, the probe can be adjusted both\nradially and circumferentially. In addition,\nthe pressure-sensing transducer in the adjustable probe is cooled internally by water\nor other cooling fluid passing through the\nannulus of the cooling system.\nThis work was done by George C.\nAshby, Jr. , W Eugene Robbins. and Lewis\nA.

August 1991\n\nCalculating Dynamics of Helicopters and Slung Loads\nMotions of multiple lifting helicopters, spreader bars, cables, and loads can be simulated numerically.\nAmes Research Center, Moffett Field, California\nGeneral equations have been derived\nfor numerical simulations of the motions\nof multiple-lift, slung-load systems that\nconsist of two or more lifting helicopters\nand loads slung from them by various\ncombinations of spreader bars, cables ,\nnets, and attaching hardware. The use of\nmultiple (usually. two) helicopters to lift\nloads too heavy for one of them has been\nadvocated tor decades. However, with the\nexception of some limited flight tests and\na few isolated commercial operations. the\ndual-lift technique remains largely undeveloped because of the complexity of motion and the consequent difficulty of stabilizing and coordinating the motion, both\nalong the flightpath and in precise hover.\nNew general equations are readily programmable for efficient computation of the\nmotions; thus, they lend themselves well\nto the analysis and design of control strategies for stabilization and coordination.\nIn the mathematical model of a multiplelift system, the helicopters, spreader bar(s),\nand load are treated as rigid bodies. The\nattaching hardware and nets are not modeled. The cables are treated as massless\nstraight-line links that can be either inelastic (in the sense of unstretchable) or elastically stretchable. The aerodynamics of the\ncables are neglected. This model is expected to represent motions adequately at\nthe frequencies up to a few hertz that are\nof interest in controlling the trajectories of\nthe helicopters.\nThe derivation begins with the application of the Newton and Euler equations of\nmotion to each rigid body, the definition\nof vectors that describe the configuration\nof the system, the introduction of generalized velocity coordinates, and the application of O\'A!embert\'s principle to each body\nin the system. This approach leads to three\nformulations, two of which are generalized\nversions of formulations developed previously for specific cases involving inelastic\nand elastic cables. The third formulation\nis a new one obtained by choosing the\ngeneralized coordinates in the elasticcable formulation in such a way that they\nare partitioned into (1) d coordinates that\nrepresent the motion of the system as\nthough the cables were inelastic and (2)\nc coordinates that describe the component of the motion due to stretching of the\ncables (where c is the number of constraints that would be imposed by the\ncables if they were inelastic). For inelastic\nsuspensions, the cable. tensions are 0btained from the equations governing the\nstretching-motion coordinates, and this\nsolution is used in the equation for the reNASA Tech Briefs, August 1991\n\nmaining coordinates. In comparison with\nthe conventional formulation, the new formulation is computationally more efficient.\nThe new formulation has been applied\nto obtain equations for the dual-lift system\nillustrated in the middle of the figure. The\nother dual-lift systems shown at the left\nand right can be treated as special cases\nof the system in the middle by appropriate\n\nsimplifications of the equations to account\nfor elimination of the bridle cables (left) or\nelimination of the spreader bar and tether\ncables (right).

The new gauge yields more\naccurate surface heat-flux data for verifying aerodynamic and heat-transfer models.\nThe figure shows a schematic of the\nnew heat-flux gauge mounted into a metal\nor alloy specimen. The gauge comprises\nthe following items: (1) an annulus fabricated part way through the specimen\nthickness, (2) a wall extending from the\nbottom of the annulus to the active surface of the gauge, (~) a cylindrical thermoplug that is surrounded by the annulus,\n(4) thermocouple thermoelements attached\nto the side and back of the thermoplug,\n(5) a thermocouple with a hot junction\nmounted near the active surface of the\ngauge, and (6) a cover enclosing the thermoplug and thermocouples.\nConventional gauges are generally\nmounted by screwing or welding them into position. Sharp temperature changes\nare possible across the temperature discontinuities formed by the resulting threads\nor seams. These t~mperature discontinuities can produce large errors of measured\nsurface heat flux. Unlike a conventional\ngauge, the new gauge is not screwed or\nwelded into place, but instead a thermoplug and annulus are electrical-dischargemachined (EDM) into the specimen\nmaterial. The EDM process leaves no interface between the material and the thermoplug, thus inherently increasing gauge\naccuracy by eliminating the interface and\nthe associated temperature discontinuity.\nThe EDM process is also conducive to accurate fabrication of minute gauges.\nGauges can be fabricated in a variety\nof sizes. Thermoplug diameters are currently 0.040 in. (1 .02 mm), and lengths are\nabout 0.060 in. (1.52 mm). Wall thicknesses nominally vary from about 0.010 in.\n(0.25 mm) to 0 .020 in.

The junctions are located circumferentially 120 0 from each other along\nthe length of the thermoplug. The wires\nare extended from the junctions in a direction perpendicular to the cylindrical plug\nsurface and are then routed through the\nannulus to the back of the gauge. The\nwires are carefully positioned so that they\ndo not touch metal surfaces. The coaxial\nthermocouple assemblies are then extended from the rear of the material gauge (see\nfigure) and laid side by side within grooves\nelectrical-discharge-machined into the\nmaterial. The grooves and assemblies are\ncovered with metallic, material welded to\nthe specimen. The thermocouple assemblies are extended to remote data systems\nfor temperature-data storage. A cover is\nwelded over the plug to seal thermally insulating air within the annulus. The air\nminimizes heat loss from the thermoplug.\nTo measure temperature near the active\nsurface, individual Chromel and Alumel\nthermoelements in the coaxial thermocouple assemblies are joined and spotwelded to the bottom of a hole electrical-dis-\n\ncharge-machined from the annulus side\ninto the wall (see figure).

Therefore, studies of resistance to delamination should account\nfor the effects of combined opening and\nshear stresses, referred to as mode I and\nmode II stresses, respectively.\nAlthough most delamination tests are\ncurrently conducted by use of single-mode\nspecimens, various mixed-mode test procedures have been introduced. Unfortunately, each of these mixed-mode test procedures has one or more limitations_For\nexample, with some tests, only a narrow\nrange of mode IImode II ratios can be\ntested, and others require difficult timeconsuming numerical analyses of the test\nresults. Therefore, the mixed-mode-bending delamination apparatus was developed\nto apply mode I and mode II loads simultaneously to a simple test coupon to measure delamination resistance.\nThe figure illustrates a test conducted\nwith the apparatus. The specimen is loaded in a manner that represents a combination of two well-known procedures used\nin pure mode I and mode II testing . The\nupward load on the right end is like that\nused in a double-cantilever-beam (DCB)\ntest for mode I delamination. The downward\nload is like that used in an end-notch\xc2\xb7flexure (ENF) test for mode II delamination.\nThese loads can be applied simultaneously to produce combined mode I and mode\nII delamination in the specimen.\nThe combined load is produced by applying a Single load to a beam attached\nto the specimen. Bonded hinges on the\nend of the specimen are attached to the\nloading beam and to the base of the apparatus by use of grips. The left end of the\nspecimen rests on a supporting roller.

These\ntwo loads are in proportion to the applied\nload, and their relative magnitudes depend\non the loading distance, c. By varying c,\na wide range of mode IImode II ratios for\nmixed\xc2\xb7mode delamination testing can be\nproduced.\nThe mode I and mode II loading on the\nspecimen can be expressed in terms of\nthe applied load, which can be measured\nby use of a conventional test machine.\nThen simple equations related to DeB and\nENF testing can be used to resolve the\nmeasured mixed-mode response into its\nmode I and mode II components. For example, mixed-mode delamination toughness can be determined by measuring the\napplied load during an increment of\ndelamination growth and can then be resolved into mode I and mode II components. Also, these simple equations for\npure mode I and mode II testing provide\nfor selection of c to obtain desired mode\nIImode II test ratios.\nIn this technique, the individual mode\nI and mode II contributions to delamination in the specimen can be analyzed by\nuse of simple beam-theory equations,\nthereby eliminating the need for time-consuming, difficult numerical analysis.

This study was\na test of modem numerical methods for\nthe solution of the equations of fluid dy.\nnamics, and was conducted as a step toward future work on more difficult problems.\nThe body COnsisted of a solid circular\ncylinder at the c:loINnstream end and tapered in an ogive of revolution to a point on\nthe axis at the upstream end. The cylinder\nhad a length-to<iiameter ratio of 1, and the\nratio of the length of the ogive to the diame-\n\nter of the cylinder was 3.5, yielding an overalliength-to-diameter ratio of 4.5.\nThe ogive/cylinder was placed in a towing tank and a camera was mounted to\nmove along with it. The tank was filled with\nsalt water seeded with small particles.\nWhen illuminated by a fan of laser light and\nphotographed, the particles produced\nstreak images, the lengths and directions\nof which indicated the local velocity of the\nflow about the body. "Observations were\nmade at angles of attack of 30 \xc2\xb0 and 45 0 .\nPrevious studies had shown that the flow is\nsteady at angles of attack up to 60 0 .\nFor the Simulation, the flow was repre73\n\nsented by the Navier-stokes equations in\nmass-averaged variables, with terms for\npseudocompressibility. The pseudocom\xc2\xb7\npressibility allows the use of an implicit\nfinit&difference scheme and relaxes the\nrequirement of incompressibility during the\nconvergence process. Upon reaching the\nsteady state, the effect of the pseudocompressibility on a solution becomes negligible, and the solution is essentially that of\nthe Navier-Stokes equations of incompressible flow.\nThe computational mesh conforming to\nthe ogive/cylinder was generated by a twodimensional Poisson-grid generator in the\nplane of the body axis. The plane was then\nrotated about the axis to generate a threedimensional wrapped mesh. The outer\nboundary was spherical and located six\nbody lengths from the tip of the ogive.\nThe equations were solved numerically\nby use of the INS3D computer code. Implicit second-order and explicit fourth\xc2\xb7\norder numerical dissipation was added to\ndamp out high\xc2\xb7frequency oscillations. The\nsolution was advanced in time until the\nsteady state was reached.\nThe computed and photographed crossflows at various positions along the ogive\nand at both angles of attack were in qualita\xc2\xb7\ntive agreement. In general, the crossflow,\nwhich develops along the body, produces a\npair of leaside vortices.

There\nare many such causes, most of which are\nrelated to aerodynamic phenomena around\nrotor blades and fuselages. Among the\n\nmost notable advancements of recent decades have been computer codes for the\nprediction of high-speed impulsive noise, a\ntechnique for the measurement of noise in\nflight, and a jOint Armylhelicopter-industry\ntest program in an anechoic wind tunnel.\nOne of the three main topics discussed\nin the report is high-speed impulsive noise.\nExperimental data have been taken by a\nquiet airplane instrumented with microphones, flying in formation with a helicopter. High-speed impulsive noise manifests\nitself in such measurements as strong negative pressure peaks observed during level\nflight at high speeds. This type of noise has\nbeen shown to be caused by effects of the\nthicknesses of rotor blades and transonic\nflow around the blades. High-speed impulsive noise has also been studied with\nmodels in wind tunnels. From flight and\nwind-tunnel tests, it has become clear that\nhigh-speed impulsive noise can be scaled\nand that the primary scaling parameter is\nthe mach number of the advancing tip of\nthe rotor blade.\nThe theoretical analysis of high-speed\nimpulsive noise is based on an equation for\nthe far-field acoustic pressure in terms of\nmonopole and dipole integrals over the\nsurfaces of rotor blades and the surrounding volume. Comparisons between theoretical predictions and experimental data\nare presented.\nThe second main topic is noise caused\n\nWe Can Convert Anyone\nOur products convert any high-resolution graphics\ndi play to standard NT C or PAL video.

The study focusses\nupon the degree to which these growing\nflow structures hasten or retard their own\nfurther growth, and upon the related ques\xc2\xb7\ntion of the differences between flows computed according to mathematical models\nof S\xc2\xb7layer and T-Iayer mixing.\nAn S (for "space") layer is a shear layer\nthat develops downstream of a point where\nthe two streams are brought into tangential contact. This kind of shear layer is better suited to experimental study in a labo\xc2\xb7\nratory where, for example. it can be formed\nat the downstream edge of a thin splitter\nplate. A T (for "time") layer is a shear layer\nin which infimtesimal wrinkles grow and\nroll up into vortexes. developing In time\nfrom an Initial tangential velocity discontinuity at the plane separating the half\nspaces that contain the imlial uniform\nflows. A T-Iayer is better suited 10 theoretical study because the differential equations thai describe its development are\nparabolic in time (as opposed to elliptic for\n\nthe &Iayer) and, therefore, an initial per\xc2\xb7\nturbation can be specified according to the\nlinear theory and its growth treated by\nlinearlweakly nonlinear and computational\ntechniques.\nThe author notes that despite the similarities between S- and T-Iayers, the common practice of interpreting observqtions\nof S in terms of calculations with T may\nbe misleading. One of the physical questions associated with the difference between 1- and S-Iayers is whether distant\nvortexes, which have already paired once\nor several times downstream in the &Iayer,\ncan induce perturbations upstream that\nseed the subharmonic instability. If so, the\ndownstream development of the S\xc2\xb7layer\nwould not depend on perturbations im\xc2\xb7\nposed upstream but the S\xc2\xb7layer would\ncreate its own perturbations and continue\nto develop downstream. To examine this\nquestion, the author offers a model of the\nS\xc2\xb7layer that introduces the elliptic nature\nof real flow indirectly to some level of ap\xc2\xb7\nproximation in the solution for the T-Iayer.\nThe method of comparison between the\nS- and T-models is to assume that the Vorticity of the S-Iayer is given parabolically\nby a Galilean mapping of that of the T-Iayer,\nto satiSfy the appropriate boundary con\xc2\xb7\nditions in the S-Iayer and compute the\nvelocity induced at any point in the S\xc2\xb7layer\nby its vorticity field, and to compare this\nvelocity to that which can be derived from\nthe velocity of the T-Iayer at corresponding\npoints by a Galilean transformation of the\nvelocity itself. The purpose of these cal\xc2\xb7\nculations is to assess approximately how\nfar the flow in the S\xc2\xb7layer is from parabolic\nand, in particular, to what extent the per\xc2\xb7\nturbations induced upstream by large\ndownstream concentrations of vorticity ex\xc2\xb7\nert the retarding or hastening effect described above. The results of the calculations suggest that this elliptic influence, or\nthe feedback, in a mixing layer is relative\xc2\xb7\nIy small. at least for flows in which the nOfmalized difference between the two initial\nvelocities is relatively small. Thus. the trans\xc2\xb7\nformation method used in this study offers\na suitable tool for the study of such flows.\nThis VvOrk was done by Upender K.

The damping seal would act as an auxiliary bearing,\nrelieving the bearing balls of significant portions of both the static and the dynamic\nbearing loads. The damping from the seal\nwould reduce the dynamic loads even further by reducing the amplitude of vibrations\nin the second vibrational mode of the rotor,\nwhich mode occurs when the rotor is turning at nearly the full operating speed. The\ndamping-seal-cartridge design is intended\nfor use in the high-pressure-oxygen turbopump of the Space Shuttle main engine, but\nthe design concept should also be applicable to other turbomachinery bearings.\nThe bearing cartridge would be mounted\nwith O.OOl-in. (O.D2frlnm) radial clearance\nin the backup support attached to the stator.\nThe outer races of the bearing would be\nmounted with O.ooo5-in. (O.Ol3-mm) radial\nclearance in the bearing cartridge (see figure). Because the static lateral loads would\nremain greater than the ctjnamic lateral loads\n\nthroughout each turn of the rotor, the bearings and cartridge would be held to one side\nwithin their radial clearances.\nThe damping seal would be formed by\nthe fluid in the gap between the knurled inner surface of the cartridge and the smooth\nouter surface of a spacer on the rotor.

This\narrangement would partly deswirl the flow\nas it entered the damping-seal gap. Deswir~\ning would reduce the undesired cross-<:oopling stiffness while maintaining the desired\ndirect stiffness and damping for optimum\nrotordynamic performance. As it emerged\nfrom the damping-seal gap, this flow would\ndischarge directly into the heat"generating\nzone of the ball bearings, thereby helping\nto remove heat from the bearings and consequently prolonging their operating life.\nThe design of the seal is limited by the\n\navailable supply pressure and rate of flow.\nThe seal is designed to impose the controlling resistance in its flow circuit and to provide maximum stiffness versus leakage,\nthus providing maximum support for the\nrotor in the face of the limited supply flow.\nThe design that results from this combination of requirements calls for the knurled\ncartridge surface and a gap that tapers from\n0.008 in.

It is formed\nby directing some of the pumped fluid On\nthis case, liquid oxygen) into the volume defined by the roughened or pocketed inner\nsurface of a stator member and the smooth\nouter surface of a rotor member that fits in\nthe stator merrber with a small radial clearance. The clanlling seals are required to act\nin parallel with, and remove most or all of\nthe radial load from, the ball bearings during operation. The damping seals and ball\nbearings must act in concert to suppress\nthe bending-mode vibrations of the rotor. The\noverall result should be longer bearing lives\n\nand a rotor-supporting system that is almost\nfully redundant.\nThe modified bearing packages are required to be robust and simple and to allow\nthe proper transfer of loads to the damping\nseals. This means, among other things, the\nsmooth transfer of loads from the ball bearings to the seals as the pump approaches\nthe operating speed. The installation of the\nseals must not impose any additional bearing loads (b ~ because of slight misalignments caused by accumulations of\nmanufacturing tolerances) and must not\ncompromise the integrity of the PUfTll in any\nother way. The seals are required to function with the pressure gradients available\nin the unmodified pump design. The damping seals are also required to prevent rotation of the outer races of the ball bearings.\nDuring the design study, specifications\nfor the required performance, design enve-\n\nThese reports, studies, handbooks are available from NASA as Technical Support Packages (TSP\'s) when a Request Card number\nis cited; otherwise they are available from\nthe National Technicallnformation Service.\n\n,~ Damping\n\nSeals Would Help\n.~ Support Turbopump Rotor\n\nTentative designs are presented.\nA report describes an engineering study\nof the proposed use of damping seals as\nmajor load-carrying members of the highpressure-oxygen turbopump of the Space\nShuttle main engine.

Wrth simple modifications, the systems can be reconfigured to accommodate the widely\nvarying transfer energies of the phases of\nthe mission (from Earth to orbit about the\nEarth, from orbit about the Earth to orbit\nabout Mars, from orbit about Mars to landing on Mars, and so forth).\nThe crew would occupy a triangular\nracetrack of three Space-Station modules:\none for dormitory and garden; one for\ngalley, wardroom, operations, and recreation; and one for science and the maintenance of health.

The results of these computations are sent over a parallel data port to\na printer/plotter, which prints the peak\nangle and mismatch and plots the cross\nsection.\nThe computerization of the third-generation pro!;lometer retains the capabilities\nof the first- and second-generation profilometers to measure the peak angles and\nmismatches of butt welds and extends\nmeasurement capabilities into the field of\nimage analysis. This makes the profilometer an expandable system in the sense\nthat the computer program can be made\nto extract and quantify subtle features in\na weld profile.

The system was conceived for use in making rocket-engine\nnozzles - specifically. for designing the\nsmall pieces of brazing foil. called "preforms:\' that are assembled edge to edge\nto cover the surface of each nozzle prior\nto brazing in a furnace. Previously. the foil\ncovers were patchworks of manually\ntrimmed. small pieces that had random.\nnonoptimum shapes and did not fit the surfaces of the nozzle in some spots. Clearly, computer-aided design can be used to\nadvantage not only in the rocket-engine application but in other applications that require the design of sheet-material parts.\nIn effect, this computer-aided design\nsystem provides an improved. accelerated\nversion of the old technique of manual\ngraphical "development" of flat sections\nof sheet metal that are to be joined at their\nedges and/or folded to make three-dimensional vessels. ducts, and the like. In contrast with the manual graphical technique,\nthe computer-aided technique rapidly\nyields accurate dimensions for the small\npieces. This capability provides for flexibility in that it enables the designer to assess\nquickly and easily the effects of changes\nin design in making engineering compromises among various sizes and shapes.\nAt the beginning of the design process,\nthe data that specify the three-dimensional\nsurface to be covered or constructed are\nfed into the computer from an engineering drawing of the surface or from an\nequivalent computer data file. From this\n\nr-::;~~~~~;::=-----I\n\nA Curved Surface of\nRevolution is approximated by flat lengthwise\nstrips that can be cut with\nthe help of templates and\nassembled edge to edge.\nIn this case, each strip is\ndivided into four pieces.\n\nbase of information and with the help of\nthe computer. the designer can develop\nthe geometric data on the pieces. Different\nshapes can be created, then translated\nand/or rotated onto the surface as required.\nThis process enables the deSigner to obtain an optimized design fairly quickly.\nThe system can plot the outline of a tentatively designed piece in full size; the\nshape can be cut out of the plotting paper\nand placed on a model of the surface to\ndetermine whether the tentative deSign\nprovides a good fit. The system can create\ndrawings of templates that are used to cut\nout the pieces (see figure). It can also\ncreate indexing-aid drawings. which assist\nin assembly by showing how to mark each\npiece to show where to place it on the surface to be covered or constructed.\nThe system can save time and money\n\nDETAIL OF LENGTHWISE STRIP\n\nin both design and fabrication.

(0.05\nmm) to 0.05 in. (1.27 mm) square. The\nmeshes are electrically thick; that is. thicknesses are comparable to the sizes of the\ncells. These meshes are used as hlghpass filters (dichroic plates) for submillimeter electromagnetic waves.\nThe figure illustrates some of the steps\nin the process. First, a standard undoped\nsilicon wafer is cut to a shape (usually\nsquare) and to a size large enough to proNASA Tech Briefs, August 1991\n\nvide a O.05-in. (1.27-mm) border around the\nmesh. To provide for an integral frame that\nwill support the mesh during the process,\nthe wafer is made at least 0.010 in. (0.25\nmm) thicker than the final mesh is expected to be.\nA high-speed dicing saw cuts parallel\nchannels in the wafer. The wafer is rotated\n90\xc2\xb0 on the saw table, and the saw cuts\nanother set of channels parallel to each\nother and perpendicular to the first set of\nchannels. forming a waffle pattem. The distance between adjacent channels defines\n\nthe size of a cell, and the width of a channel defines the thickness of the wall between adjacent cel/s. The channels are cut\nto a depth slightly greater than the intended thickness of the grid. The saw blade\nis exchanged for a much thicker grinding\nwheel. and a swath 0.05 in. (1.27 mm) wide\nis ground off around the edge of the wafer\nto provide for the frame. At this stage. the\nwafer forms the inverse of the final mesh.\nThe wafer is cleaned and placed in a\nvacuum evaporation channel with the channel side facing a vapor-deposition source\nand with a collimating baffle between the\nwafer and the source boat. A layer of titanium 50 to 100 A thick is deposited on\nthe wafer and is followed by a layer of gold\n83\n\n2,500 to 5,000 A thick. (The thin titanium\nlayer helps the gold adhere to the silicon.)\nThe baffle, with its 10:1 ratio of length to\nwid1h , causes most of the metal to be deposited only on the edge swath, the bottoms of the channels, and the tops of the\nsquares; little or no metal condenses on\nthe sidewalls of the channels.\nThe evaporated metal layers on the tops\nof the squares are cut or ground off, and\nthe wafer is cleaned again. The wafer is\nattached to an electrically insulating supporting plate, and a cathodic contact is\nclipped to the copper layer on the perimeter of the wafer. The wafer is immersed in\na copper electroforming bath at an initial\ncurrent density of 30 mAlcm2 followed by\na longer exposure at 20 mAlcm 2 until the\nchannels and the edges become filled with\ncopper. Because little or no copper had\nbeen vapor-deposited on the sidewalls of\nthe channels, the electroformed copper\nbuilds up from the bottom; there is little\nor no lateral growth of copper that could\ncause voids by blocking a channel before\nthe bottom is completely filled. This makes\nit possible to use narrow channels and,\nconsequently, to make thin walls; the thickness of a wall can be as little as one-fifth\nthe thickness of the mesh (the height of\nthe wall).\nWhen the channels are filled with copper, the wafer is removed from the electroforming bath and rubbed on fine emery\npaper to remove any copper that has\ngrown on the squares and to flatten out\n\nCIIT SlUCON WAFER TO\nINITW.

The verification process ensures the\naccuracy of a mathematical model that\nrepresents the tooling in an off-line programming system that numerically simulates the operation of the robotic welding\nsystem. In so doing, the process helps to\nprevent damaging collisions between the\nwelding equipment and the workpiece, to\nensure that the tooling is positioned and\noriented properly with respect to the workpiece, and/or to determine whether the\ntOOling has to be modified or adjusted to\nachieve the foregoing objectives.\nThe mathematical model for a tool to\nbe used in welding a given workpiece is\nfirst developed on a computer-aided-design system (e.g., Computervision or equivalent). The model is transferred to another\ncomputer-aided-design system (e.g., Uni\xc2\xb7\ngraphics or equivalent) for the generation\nof test points at various known locations\non the tool. These are points to which a\ntool\xc2\xb7inspecting robot will subsequently be\ncommanded to move.\nThe model of the tool and the test\xc2\xb7polnt\ninformation are then viewed with the help\nof commercially available simulation soft\xc2\xb7\nware (e.g., PLACE or equivalent). The posi\xc2\xb7\ntion and the orientation of the surface are\nverified at each test poin!. If the orienta\xc2\xb7\ntion at a point is improper, it could cause\nthe inspecting robot to attempt to reach\nbeyond the limits of its joints. Consequent\xc2\xb7\nIy, it may be necessary to alter the mathematical model of the tool. Once the model\nand the test points are satisfactory, they\nare saved in a computer file From this fife,\nthe locations of the test points (relative to\nwhere the tool is attached to a position\'\ning table) are computed and used to create\na trajectory for the inspecting robot.\nThe off\xc2\xb7line programming system is used\nto create a program to move the inspect\xc2\xb7\nNASA Tech Briefs, August 1991\n\ning robot to the desired test points on the\nreal tool. To do this, another simulation Is\nperformed - this time taking account of\nthe entire collection of equipment in the\nrobotic work cell, Including the robot and\nits end effector, the positioning table, and\nthe tool. The trajectory created in the pre\xc2\xb7\nvious step must be within the reach of the\nrobot, and the limits of the joints are ex\xc2\xb7\namined to verify this.\nTo prevent damage to the tool or the in\xc2\xb7\nspecting robot, collisions are detected duro\ning this simulation. The alignment and location of the tool on the positioning table\nare also watched to determine whether the\nmathematical model has to be adjusted\nfurther. At the completion of a successful\nsimulation (that is, when there are no col\xc2\xb7\nlisions and no joint limits are exceeded),\nthe program for the robot is created and\ntransmitted electronically to the robot con\xc2\xb7\ntroller.\nThe tool is mounted on the positioning\ntable A special end effector that measures\nthe position of the robot relative to the sur\xc2\xb7\nface under inspection is mounted on the\nrobot. This measurement is then performed\nat each test point. The resulting measurement data are used to determine whether\nthe mathematical model of the tool match\xc2\xb7\nes the real tool.

The OMP approach differs\nfrom the classical artificial-intelligence approach to scheduling , in which a schedule\nis built-up in straightforward incremental\nfashion and if any proposed change in a\nschedule could give rise to a conflict in\na subsequent scheduled event, the entire\npart of the schedule beyond the change\nmust be rebuilt to take account of the\nchange. OMP software can be used in\nboth the generation of new schedules and\nthe modification of existing schedules in\nview of changes in tasks and/or available\nresources. Although the OMP project focused upon the scheduling of operations\nof scientific instruments and other equipment aboard a spacecraft, the OMP approach is also applicable to such terrestrial\nproblems as scheduling production in a\nfactory.\nThe OMP approach is based on iterative\nrefinement like that \'Jracticed by expert\nhuman schedulers: the scheduling software builds and refines a schedule by\nmaking a series of passes over the entire\nschedule, learning from each pass and\nmodifying both the schedule and the\nscheduling technique as it learns. In the\nmultiphase OMP approach, the planning\nphases can be interleaved, enabling the\nscheduling software to look globally over\nthe whole schedule or focus locally on a\ngiven part of the schedule at its discretion.\nThe principal innovations of OMP iterative\nrefinement are the following:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Unlike in the classical approach, illegal\nschedules (those that contain conflicts)\nare representable.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 The schedule is refined and conflicts\nare resolved by modifying an existing\nschedule, not by building a new schedule\nfrom the beginning.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Information about the state of the schedule from prior passes is used to guide\nthe scheduling actions in subsequent\npasses.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Different strategies are used during different passes.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Backtracking is not required. If a poor decision is made. it can be unmade through\nan appropriate action.

In a significant departure from\nclassical planning software, the OMP software allows illegal schedules to be developed and conflicts to exist within a\nschedule during its evolution. By first building schedules that help to identify the\nareas of high contention for resources and\ninteractions among tasks (denoted as\n" bottlenecks"), the software can focus its\nscheduling efforts. This parallels the expert human approach. Human schedulers\nfirst throw everything onto timelines, which\nare data structures that represent usage\nof resources and assignments of tasks\nover time, to identify the potential problem\nareas. Once they have identified these\nareas, they begin focusing their efforts\nthere, jumping back and forth from one\narea to another to narrow the problems.\n\nA schedule without conflicts is produced\nonly as a final output.\nTo implement iterative refinement, it has\nbeen necessary to develop and incorporate some new artificial-intelligence concepts. These include highly interdependent, advanced concepts of the multilevel\ncontrol of scheduling functions (see figure),\nthe representation of scheduled tasks, and\nchronologies (limited histories of scheduling activities and the effects of them on\nthe schedule). Chronologies are needed\nto support assessment heuristics, which\nidentify and classify bottlenecks and are\nrequired to support the multilevel control\nmechanisms. In turn, the multilevel control mechanisms are necessary to support\nknowledge-intensive searches, which in\nturn are necessary because of the enhanced representation of scheduled tasks.\nThe integration of all these pieces into a\nworking model of an iterative-refinement\nscheduling system is the most significant\nachievement of the OMP research .\nThis work was done by Eric W Biefeld\nand Lynne P.

This algebra provides\na succinct representation of the mathematically complicated interactions among\nmultiple joints and links of a manipulator,\nthereby relieving the analyst of most of the\ntedium of detailed algebraic manipulations.\nThe report presents an analytical formulation of the spatial-operator algebra, describes some specific applications, summarizes current research, and discusses\nimplementation of the spatial-operator algebra in the Ada programming language.\nThe elements of this algebra are certain\n\nlinear operators that are always present\nin the equations that describe the dynamic\nand kinematic behavior of manipulators.\nThe domain and range spaces of these OJ>\nerators consist of forces, velOCities, and\naccelerations. They are called " spatial "\noperators because they show how forces,\nvelOCities, and accelerations propagate\nthrough space from one rigid body (e.g.,\na link of a manipulator) to the next. Not only\ndo such operators have obvious physical\ninterpretations, but they are also implicitly equivalent to recursions from link to link\nalong the manipulator arms. These recursions can be turned immediately into implementable algorithms by projecting onto appropriate coordinate frames.\nThe spatial operators are elements in\nthe algebra of linear bounded operators\nthat map between finite-dimensional Hilbert\nspaces. The algebra of these operators is\nknown as a Banach algebra in the theory\nof linear operators. The inversion of an operator can , of course, be achieved by the\ntraditional techniques of linear algebra. In\naddition, many important spatial operators\ncan be factored as the product of a causal,\na diagonal, and an anticausal operator. For\nsuch an operator, inversion can be achieved\nby the inward/outward-sweep solutions of\nspatially recursive Kalman filtering.\nThe spatial-operator algebra provides a\nhigh-level mathematical framework for the\n\ndescription of the kinematic and dynamic\nbehavior of a manipulator and for the corresponding control and trajectory-design\nalgorithms. Expressions interpreted within\nthe algebraic framework lead to enhanced\nconceptual and physical understanding of\nthe dynamics and kinematics of manipulators. The spatial-operator algebra can be\nused to solve any problem in the dynamics\nof multiple interacting rigid bodies; in so\ndoing, it enables the equations of motion\nto be manipulated at a very high level of\nabstraction in which many of the quantities\nbeing manipulated are causal or anticausal linear operators. As a consequence, at\nany stage of an abstract manipulation of\noperators, spatially recursive algorithms to\nimplement the operator expressions can\nbe obtained readily by inspection. As a further consequence, the transition from atr\nstract-operator mathematics to practical\nimplementation is relatively easy, requires\nonly a simple mental exercise, and can be\nautomated readily with a computer program.\nThis work was done by Guillermo\nRodriguez, Kenneth K.

DAWN incorporates both\nconventional software for quantitative mathematical modeling of physical, chemical,\nand biological processes and an expert\nsystem that offers the user its stored knowledge about materials and processes.\nDAWN enables a user to jump from one\ndesign level to another - for example,\nfrom a detailed evaluation of reaction kinetics to an overall concept of the process\nto an overall energy balance.\nThe user can call on the conventional\nsoftware for help in solving clearly defined\nproblems for which ample data are available. Then the user can ask the expert system for qualitative, common-sense reasoning and rules of thumb in developing new\nconcepts for which few empirical data are\navailable.\n\nFor example, if a designer wished to\nconsider the separation of water from salt,\nDAWN would propose two alternatives:\ncentrifuging or flashing (see figure). Suppose that the designer decides to consider\nflashing. DAWN then leads the designer\nthrough an evaluation. It informs the designer that flashing is a viable alternative\nif the boiling points of the components are\nfar away from each other. It finds that heat\nmust be added to the stream to effect flash\nseparation and that the first effect of the\naddition of heat would be a change of\nphase (it would not be a change of temperature; DAWN "knows" that in this case\nthe water must first change from a solid\nto a liquid). DAWN continues to simulate\nthe effect of the addition of heat and defines each change of state until the goal\nof separation is reached. The user can ask\nto see the characteristics of the mixture\nat any state.\nThis example illustrates how DAWN accepts a goal (separation), breaks it down\ninto possible subgoals (flash, centrifuge),\nChange\nPhase for\nStream\n\nCentrifuge\nStream\nSeparate\nNaCI and\nH20 In\nStream\n\nChange\nPhase for\nStream\nFlash _\nStream\n\nand simulates the effects (a sequence of\nstates) of the process associated with the\nchosen subgoal (in this case, the addition\nof heat associated with flashing). The user\ncan control the path of the design and\nsimulation. For example, the path can be\nvaried by addition of subgoals or by beginning with a higher-level goal like an incineration process or a lower-level goal like\na change of phase of water.\nAt the process level, DAWN has a\n"smart front end," wherein the user defines a process in some detail, and a\n"smart back end," wherein the user compares the results of a quantitative simulation (based on conventional software\nmodels) with the predictions made by the\nsmart front end. The smart back end helps\nthe user make rough calculations, suggests basic assumptions, offers some\nquantitative reference data, and explains\nequations.\nThis vvork ~s done by Mary R.

Holography, another of Marzwell\'s research interests, could prove\nespecially fru itfu l. Three-dimensional holog raphic imageswith data on position , depth, and intensity-provide a detailed\npicture often inaccessible through other means. A holographic\ndisplay system developed under an SBIR contract by Computer Sciences Corporation provides near-real-time, full parallax images of a remote work site, enabling human\nsupervisors to more accurately monltor and control mechanical systems .\nWhen a task is particularly difficult, simulations can provide\na safe and inexpensive training ground. KMS Fusion Inc.,\nunder contract to JPL, has created the Global Local Environment Telerobotics Simulator (GLETS), which immerses an\noperator in a real-time , interactive simulation. By superimposing the real image on the recorded simulation , GLETS can\nupdate the virtual environment and alert the robot and operator to variances and impending errors . Specialized software\nallows the robot to correct and learn from its mistakes, update\nits database, and proceed safely with the task. The system\nprovides a means for remote handling operations in hazardous environments and serves as an aid to mission planning .\nAs robotics technology becomes more sophisticated, human assistance will be summoned to solve problems only\nwhen the robot has exhausted its own store of possible\nsolutions . This will free humans to oversee teams of robots\nengaged in increasingly complex activities from ever greater\ndistances. Marzwell envisions robotic systems expanding in\ntrainability, retention, self-learning, and self-organization. With\nthese developments, he said, will come the autonomy needed\nto enhance performance and safety , increase productivity,\nand reduce costs in countless fields of human endeavor. 0\n\nEditor\'s note: Dr. Marzwell will discuss several of these\nadvanced robotic systems at Technology 2001 , the second\nnational technology transfer conference, December 3-5 in\nSan Jose, CA.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 100% reactive-does not contain solvents\nor other volatiles \xe2\x80\xa2 Excellent adhesion\nto similar and dissimilar substrates\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Remarkable electrical insulation\ncharacteristics \xe2\x80\xa2 High physical\nstrength properties \xe2\x80\xa2 Resists vibrat ion. impact & shock \xe2\x80\xa2 Outstanding dimensional stability and\ndurability \xe2\x80\xa2 Superior resistance\nto water. fuels and other\naggressive chemicals\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Convenient packaging\nFor Informa tion.\nca ll or write:\nMaster Bond Inc..\n1 Hobart St.\n54\nHackensack.
