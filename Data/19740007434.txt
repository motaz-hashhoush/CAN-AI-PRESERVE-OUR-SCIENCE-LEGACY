In addition, the thrusters are used to unload the reaction wheels\nused for attitude control and for other purposes described in\nthe report. The proposed satellite has been named TADPOLE\nwhich is an acronym for "Technology Application Demonstration Program of Low Expense."\n\n2\nINTRODUCTION\nThe TADPOLE satellite that is described subsequently represents a\npreliminary proposal outline prepared by the Spacecraft Technology Division at the LeRC. The purposes of the proposal in its present form are\nto ascertain the degree of interest in such a proposal and to solicity comments on the proposal. The information provided is preliminary and for\ndiscussion purposes only.\nMISSION OBJECTIVES\nThe mission objectives are listed in figure 1 and presume that the\nsatellite is in a synchronous near equatorial orbit. Discussion of these\nmission objectives follows:\nObjectives I and II. - Ion thrusters have been under development by\nthe LeRC and other organizations for a number of years yet their practical application remains to be demonstrated. Their use at synchronous\naltitude for station keeping and attitude control represents one of the\nmost attractive application of these propulsive devices as has been detailed in many studies. The ability to execute this experiment exist at\nthe LeRC and should be used to translate this technology into a practical capability for synchronous orbit use.\nATS-F will fly ion engines that will be used for demonstration of\nNorth-South station keeping and attitude control. This experiment will\nbe valuable in promoting the use of ion engines. However, the demonstration is short term and experimental in nature and, therefore, will not\nprovide the practical demonstration of the functional readiness of ion engines required by future spacecraft projects. In contrast, TADPOLE\nwill demonstrate the practicality of using ion engines as in-line functional\nelements of the attitude control and station keeping system for long duration missions. Thus, the successful performance of TADPOLE will\ngreatly encourage the practical application of ion engines to future spacecraft.\nThe CTS project would have provided a space flight demonstration of\nspacecraft station keeping with an ion thruster, but the ion engine experiment on CTS has been canceled.\n\n3\nThe proposed TADPOLE experiment could be brought along in the same\ntime frame and provide a more complete and practical demonstration of the\ntechnology than the canceled CTS experiment.\nThere exist also a real requirement to demonstrate a low cost precision station keeping and attitude control capability for a spacecraft having\nsun oriented solar arrays and an earth oriented center body. Such a configuration and capability has many advantages over existing synchronous\norbit spacecraft. A sun oriented solar array minimizes the solar cell area\nrequired to preform mission functions and hence reduces the spacecraft\nsize and cost. Precise station keeping of the earth oriented center body\ngreatly simplifies the ground communication equipment repuired to make\nuse of the synchronous orbit platform. The simplification of ground\nequipment and attendant lower cost will greatly expand the range of domestic and foreign user orginizations that can afford a synchronous orbit\nplatform.\nThe CTS will provide a first step in the required development, but its\nplanned station keeping capabilities ((&i 1 degree. incatihaion,, \xc2\xb1 0. 2 degrees\neast-west) and attitude control (\xc2\xb1 0. 1 degrees in pitch and roll;,1. 1 degrees in yaw) can be improved upon significantly. The proposed TADPOLE\nwould provide a demonstration of this improved capability. In addition,\nTADPOLE would represent a NASA technology development readily available to U. S. industry and government users.\nObjective III. - A major item of cost in developing and constructing a\nprecisely stabilized spacecraft is associated with the attitude sensing systems. The sensing systems commonly proposed for three axis stabilized\nspacecraft employ star trackers, and more recently interferometers or\nboth for precise sensing of spacecraft attitude. Both systems are extremely expensive and the interferometer systems as well as being in a\ndevelopment status, require ground station support to function. The\nproposed TADPOLE sensing system eliminates the need for either a star\ntracking or interferometer system and relies on inexpensive rate integratiing gyros and sun sensors for the critical yaw sensing requirements.\nDemonstration of the performance and reliability of the TADPOLE system\nwould permit substantial cost reductions in all but the most precisely\noriented synchronous orbit spacecraft.\n\n4\nObjective IV. - Availability of a solar array orientation mechanism\n(SAOM) and power/signal transfer slip ring system are crucial to the\ndevelopment of low cost orbit platforms. The systems that have been\nflown do not satisfy the requirements of a precisely stabilized synchronous\norbit platform and have been prone to failure. However, systems have\nbeen under development for a number of years within NASA and elsewhere\nthat circumvent the problems of existing systems. For example, liquid\nmetal slip rings (LMSR) have been developed at the LeRC that solve the\nwear debris problem and eliminate the stiction problem associated with\nconventional slip rings. This technology must be demonstrated in an actual spacecraft however, before it will find acceptance and receive general\napplication to future spacecraft. This LMSR technology as well as the\nlatest SAOM technology would be demonstrated on the proposed TADPOLE.\nObjective V. - Solar arrays using silicon srlar cells are essentially\nthe exclusive source of electrical power for earth satellites.\nthe cells have basic limitations associated with them in that:\n\nHowever,\n\n(1) The cell\'s power is developed at low voltage, approximately 0. 5\nvolts per cell.\n(2) The cell\'s power degrades with time in the radiation environment\nof space.\n(3) The cell\'s power output is sensitive to cell temperature variations.\nAs a result of the above limitations the cells have only been used to\ndate as a raw source of low voltage power. Un fortunately this low voltage\npower does not meet most spacecraft electrical load requirements. As a\nconsequence, this low voltage power must be conditioned using complex\nand expensive power conditioning equipment. This power conditioning\nequipment is also heavy and its inefficientcy results in significant spacecraft thermal, structural and other design problems. For many electrical\nloads this power conditioning equipment can be eliminated by uising integrated solar array power conditioning techniques pioneered by the LeRC.\nThese techniques consist essentially of configuring solar cells in the required series/parallel groupings such that the electrical load voltage and\ncurrent requirements are satisfied. Power variations in the cells due to\ntemperature and radiation effects are compensated for by shorting switches\non the array that can be used to control the power output of the cell :\ngrouping in a controlled fashion. Protection due to cell or interconnect\n\n5\nfailures is provided by diodes in parallel with cell groupings.\n\nThese ad-\n\nvanced power control techniques would be demonstrated on TADPOLE for\nappropriate thruster electrical loads. Such a demonstration would provide\na significant step forward in spacecraft power system technology.\nObjective VI: - In addition to demonstrating technology, the spacecraft\nwould provide an experimentation platform for a modest number of experiments. These experiments would be defined based on proposals received\nafter project approval. Obvious candidates are advanced solar cells,\narray fabrication techniques and follow-on SPHINX experiments.\nObjective VII. - Perhaps the major benefit to be obtained from the\ndevelopmeit is that NASA would have available for future applications a\nlow cost synchronous orbit platform or bus. Such a bus could be placed\nin orbit in the future by its own launch vehicle or could be used as a shut-tle/tug payload. It could be easily tailored to satisfy the power and size\nrequirements of many users.\nA low cost synchronous orbit platform has many applications. For\nexample, users could add communication equipment to the bus to obtain\nvery low cost communication systems. Such a communication spacecraft would be very attractive to developing countries because the precise station keeping capability of the bus would minimize ground system\ncost. Other applications of the bus are for navigation and weather\nsatellites. Because TADPOLE\'s ion engines provide it with orbit or\nstation changing capability, it could be modified with TV cameras and\nother equipment to provide surveillance and inspection of other spacecraft in synchronous orbit.\nSummary. - The TADPOLE satellite represents the next generation\nof technology to be employed in: synchronous orbit. It would be highly\nbeneficial if this new technology could be demonstrated on low cost precursor flights prior to application to more costly missions.\n\nMISSION DESCRIPTION\nThe TADPOLE configuration proposed is suitable as an auxiliary payload for launch on a Titan III C.\nThe desired launch date would be late CY 1976 or CY 1977. For a\nTitan III C the prime payload launch date would dictate the development\n\n6\nschedule followed.\nTADPOLE, on a Titan II C, could be injected into orbit by the transtage of the Titan III C at the desired operating attitude with the solar\narrays deployed. Such a capability would minimize the cost and complexity of the spacecraft.\nInformation on the Titan III C auxiliary payload capabilities, costs,\nlaunch opportunities, etc. was supplied by Martin Marietta Corporation\npersonnel during informal discussions. AF personnel at SAMSO were\nalso contacted informally in order to evaluate the authenticity of the information supplied by Martin Marietta Corporation personnel. A more\nformal route as to Titan III C launch opportunities will be pursued in the\nfuture if this proposal is viewed with favor.\nSPACECRAFT DESCRIPTION - C\nSpacecraft Configuration\nThe proposed TADPOLE is shown in figure 2 in its deployed in-orbit\nconfiguration. Structurally it consists of an earth tracking center body\nand fold-out arrays that track the sun. The solar array rotation axis is\noriented in the north-south direction (i. e. perpendicular to the synchronous orbit plane). The earth facing side of the center body contains a\nhigh gain antenna for communication with the LeRC ground station. Two\nion thrusters in conjunction with three-axis reaction wheels provide station keeping and attitude control for the spacecraft. The thrust vector of\nthe bodymounted thruster is aligned with the radial line through the center of the earth that passes through the center of gravity of the spacecraft\n(yaw axis). The thrust vector of the array mounted thruster points south\nand is aligned with the array rotation axis which passes through the center of gravity of the spacecraft (pitch axis). Each solar array panel is\nprovided a single degree, of rotation by a solar array orientation mechanism (SAOM). Slip rings in the SAOM provide for the transfer of instrumentation and command signals, and electrical power across the rotating\njoint.\nIt is proposed that TADPOLE be launched as an auxiliary payload\naboard an Air Force Titan III C launch vehicle. Provisions for such\nauxiliary payloads are made on a number of AF Titan m C launches.\n\n7\nThe auxiliary payloads are mounted in special adapters provided with the\nTranstage of the Titan III C. The configuration proposed for TADPOLE\nis shown in figure 3. Once the Transtage has achieved synchronous orbit,\nTADPOLE in its folded configuration would be translated out from the\nTranstage on rails. The solar arrays would be deployed and then TADPOLE would be released from the rail system. The Transtage has the\ncapability of orienting TADPOLE to the desired attitude prior to release.\nA Martin Marietta Corporation study contract (Contract F04701-70C-0202) with the Air Force titled "Titan III C Secondary Payload Module\nFeasibility Study Report" is the basis for the proposed TADPOLE configuration. This design study report is dated July 7, 1972.\nSolar Array Orientation Mechanism\nPower transfer from the solar array to the center body across the\nrotating interface and orientation of the solar array with respect to the\ncenter body of the spacecraft will be achieved with the liquid metal slip\nring/solar array orientation mechanism. The device will be single ended\nsuch that one is required for each solar array assembly. The total requirement can be met with two devices each approximately 5 pounds in\nweight and each with a volume envelope of 7 inches diameter by 5 inches\nlong. Total operating power consumption per device would be 5 watts at\na slewing rate of 20 revolutions per day and 1. 5 watts at the normal rate\nof 1 revolution per day. Angular position information would be obtained\nfrom an optical encoder within the device. The device would be an open\nloop device stepping in precise increments with ground update capability.\nAttitude Control and Station Keeping System\nPurpose. - The purpose of the Attitude Control and Station Keeping\nSystem on the TADPOLE spacecraft is to provide for the initial acquisition of the on-orbit orientation, for maintaining the spacecraft in its\nspecified on-orbit orientation and station within desired tolerances, to\nprovide a test bed with which to demonstrate the capability of the ion\nthrusters to perform in an accurate attitude control and station keeping\nsystem, and to provide a flight proven Attitude Control and Station Keeping\n\n8\nSystem for future use of the TADPOLE as a spacecraft bus to which additional systems could be added.\nDisturbance envitrmnen.rt - The disturbance torque environment with\nwhich the Attitude Control System (ACS) must contend in synchronous equatorial orbit is given in figure 4, which lists the predominant disturbance\ntorques and their approximate magnitudes. The ACS must provide 3-axis\ntorques to counteract these disturbances and to unload the angular momentum imparted to the spacecraft by the secular components.\nThe forces which disturb the station of the satellite are shown in figure 5. Also shown here are the equivalent velocity changes (AV) imparted\nto the spacecraft by these forces. These same AV\'s must be imparted by\nthe station keeping thrusters to compensate for these disturbances. The\nperturbations in the North-South (N-S) direction are caused by an increase\nin orbit inclination which results from gravitational attraction by the sun\nand moon. The effect on the spacecraft is to cause a daily latitudinal\nvariation of the subsatellite point north and south of the equator, of magnitude equal to the orbit inclination. Perturbations in the East-West\n(E -W) direction result from two sources. First, the earth\'s triaxiality\ncauses a constant westward drift which must be nulled, for satellites\nlocated between 150 West and 1050 West longitude. The second, and\nmajor, perturbation is caused by solar pressure on the spacecraft. The\nforce resulting from this pressure causes an increase in orbit eccentricity. The effect of the eccentricity is to produce a daily longitudinal\nvariation of the subsatellite point east and west of the desired station, of\nmagnitude (in radians) equal to twice the eccentricity.\nSystem descript im. - The satellite configuration and orientation in\norbit is shown in figure 2. Primary attitude control torques are provided\nby three reaction wheels, one acting about each spacecraft principal axis.\nThe two 8-cm ion thrusters are used to unload the reaction wheels periodically.\n\nOne thruster is located on the side of the spacecraft center body\nwhich is oriented away from the earth and thrusts radially inward. The\nother thruster is located on the tip of the north solar panel and thrusts\nsouth as shown. Each thruster has the capability of deflecting its thrust\nvector \xc2\xb1 10 degrees in two perpendicular axes. The thrust vector for\nzero deflection is oriented through the spacecraft center of mass. The\narray-mounted thruster will be used to provide N-S and E-W station\n\n9\nkeeping, and to provide torques to unload the roll and yaw reaction wheels.\nThe body mounted thruster provides a torque to unload the pitch reaction\nwheel. The radial thrust component produced during the unloading period\nby the body mounted thruster has a negligible effect on the orbit. This\nbody mounted thruster also provides a backup roll torque, although of much\nsmaller magnitude than that of the North (array-mounted) thruster. EastWest station keeping is accomplished with the North thruster by off-setting\nthe spacecraft about the yaw axis through several degrees for a portion of\nthe orbit period.\nAttitude error sensing is provided by a two-axis earth sensor located\non the earth-facing side of the center body, a two-axis sun sensor located\non the solar array root, and a single axis integrating gyro in the center\nbody. The earth sensor provides error signals about the roll and pitch\naxes-. The sun sensor provides the yaw error over a large portion of the\norbit, and the integrating gyro, which has its input axis aligned with the\nyaw axis, "fills in" for the sun sensor for those periods when the sun\nsensor does not provide yaw error with sufficient accuracy. The rate\ngyro package is us ed in conjunction with the sun sensor during initial\nattitude acquisition.\nThe attitude control system electronics accepts the various attitude\nerror signals, performs the required compensation and amplification,\nand provides control signals to the reaction wheels. It also performs the\nnecessary calculations to transform the sun sensor outputs into a yaw\nerror signal.\nStation keeping and wheel unloading are of sufficiently low duty cycle\nthat it seems desirable to command these operations from the ground.\nFigure 6 shows a weight breakdown of the AC and SK system.\nSystem operat in. - With t - attitfade disturbance torques sh6wnri\nfigure 4, wheel unloading about the roll and yaw axes would be required\nonce each day for about 10 minutes. There is: no requirement to perform\nthe unloading at any specific point in the orbit, and therefore, it could be\ncoordinated with the station keeping operation. Pitch unloading can be\ndone every 4 days. However, because of the smaller thruster moment\narm, the time required is about 90 minutes.\nNorth-South station keeping is accomplished by periodically nulling\norbit inclination. This is done by firing the array-mounted thruster for\n\n10\na period of time about the ascending node. If the correction is made daily,\nthe thruster firing time is 96 minutes, centered on the node.\nEast-West station keeping, when counteracting the effect of solar\npressure, is accomplished by rotating the line of apsides of the eccentric\norbit, using two tangential impulses, one-half an orbit period apart. The\nsolar pressure changes both the eccentricity of the orbit and the orientation\nof the line of apsides. If the line of apside is properly placed, the solar\npressure will cause the eccentricity to decrease and then increase as shown\nin figure 7. Thus, the station keeping maneuver is accomplished by rotating the line of apside each time the eccentricity reaches the allowable\nlimit. The thrusting duty cycle is a function of the satellite area-to-mass\nratio. For the TADPOLE spacecraft, using 8-cm ion thrusters, with a\ncorrection made every 7 days, the thrusting time required per correction\nis 5. 1 hours for each of two impulses, 12 hours apart. The spacecraft\noffset required is +4 degrees about the yaw axis during the first impulse,\nand -4 degrees about the yaw axis during the second impulse. Since the\ntwo impulses are one-half orbit period apart, no net change in inclination\nis caused by the north-south thrust component and the N-S station keeping\nis not affected.\nEast-West- station keeping caused by triaxiality is corrected by firing\nthe thruster in a westerly direction periodically. If the correction is\nmade every 7 days to coincide with the East-West station keeping due to\nsolar pressure, the thrusting time required is 3. 1 hours for each of two\nperiods, one-half orbit period apart. For both of these periods, the\nspacecraft offset required is 4 degrees about the positive yaw axis.\nIt must be noted that, for either East-West station keeping maneuver,\nif the yaw offset can be increased, the thrusting times can be cut down\nproportionally. The various thruster duty cycles are summarized in figgure 8.\nStationwalking capability.. - The stationwalking capability of the\nspacecraft using the radial ion thruster is shown in figure 9a. The capability using the N-S ion thruster is shown in figure 9b. This capability\nwill be required to relocate the spacecraft from the station obtained from\nthe Titan III C launch to the final operating station. The actual requirements are not known at this time since the Titan III C launch opportunity\nhas not been selected.\n\n11\nThis capability could also be used, by adding sufficient Hg propellant,\nto perform an inspection of other synchronous orbit spacecraft. However,\nsuch an inspection rendezvous has not been proposed because it would\nrequire a TV- camera and othersophiticated rendezvous equipment. - Such\nequipment would negate the philosophy of the project to develop a low cost\nsynchronous orbit bus. However, the development of the bus would obviously permit the development of an insepction spacecraft in the future if\nNASA deemed it desirable.\nIt should be noted that use of the radial thruster for stationwalking\nrequires a 900 rotation of the centerbody to align the thrust vector parallel to the orbit velocity vector.\nSolar vane experiment. - The radial thruster performs two primary\nfunctions. These are to stationwalk the spacecraft and to unload the pitch\naxis reaction wheel. If required, it can also be used to unload the roll\naxis reaction wheel and, by rolling the spacecraft, to provide a N-S station keeping thrust component. However, it is also possible to obtain a\ncontrol torque about the pitch axis by using solar vanes configured as in\nfigure 10. If the vanes are pivoted about an axis parallel to the pitch axis,\nthen proper deflection of the vanes in pairs causes the center of pressure\n(c. p. ) of the spacecraft to move in the roll pitch plane along a line parallel to the roll axis.\nThe disturbance torque about the pitch axis results primarily from\nsolar pressure acting on an offset between the spacecraft center of presm.). Because the spacecraft c. p. can\nsure (c. p.) and center of mass (c.\nbe moved by proper vane deflection, the magnitude of the solar pressure\ntorque about pitch can be varied. This capability for varying the external\ntorque as desired can be used in either of two ways. One way is to configure the vane system periodically to produce sufficient torque to unload\nthe pitch reaction wheel. However, because the primary disturbance\ntorque about pitch results itself from solar pressure it is more logical\nto use the solar vanes to eliminate the solar pressure torque and provide primary iftch control. In this mode, the pitch wheel could be eliminated, and the solar vane deflection would be controlled in a closed loop\nas a function of the pitch attitude error as measured by the earth sensor.\nThus, the vane deflection would be automatically adjusted so as to produce zero net disturbance torque about the pitch axis.\n\nIt is estimated\n\n12\nthat a vane size of 2 ft. by 2 ft. is sufficient to perform in this mode.\nSince use of the vanes in the above described control loop still must\nbe evaluated experimentally, both the vanes and the pitch reaction wheel\nwill be included in the TADPOLE configuration. Use of the solar vanes\nin the closed loop control mode would be evaluated experimentally by\nperiodically switching the vanes into the pitch control loop in place of the\npitch reaction wheel. At other times, the vanes would be adjusted by\ncommand so as to "trim" the spacecraft about pitch and minimize the\ndisturbance torque, thus minimizing the pitch wheel unloading required.\nIf the closed loop solar vane control performed satisfactorily, the\nradial thruster could be installed on the south array tip of subsequent\nspacecraft to provide backup redundancy to the single N-S thruster configuration shown in figure 2.\nIt also should be noted that control torques about the roll and yaw\naxes can be obtained by proper deflection of the solar vanes at the proper\ntimes in the orbit. These torques could be used to back up the ion thruster\nin these axes.\nA variety of techniques using the above principles are available to\nmitigate the disturbance torques on the spacecraft. These techniques\nwould be analyzed prior to selection of a final spacecraft configuration.\nThe basic selection criteria will be spacecraft simplification and cost\nreduction.\nBackup system. - A cold gas attitude control thruster system has\nbeen incorporated in the spacecraft. Under nominal conditions this system would not be activated. However, in the event the spacecraft should\nstart to tumble or not be injected into orbit properly this system would be\nactivated. Using this cold gas thruster system and battery power the proper spacecraft attitude could be acquired.\nCommunications System\nThe satellite will have a communication system which will be compatible with Goddard Aerospace Data Systems Standards X-560-63-2.\nThe elements of the system are a data handling system, command system,\ntransponder system and antenna system. A simplified block diagram of\nthe system is shown in figure 11.\n\n13\nData handling system. - The data handling system will be a Pulse\nCode Modulated (PCM) system consisting of approximately 250 data channels. Each data channel will be 10 bits long (9 data plus one parity). The\naccuracy and resolution of this system will meet the experiment requirements of the mission. The sampling rates selected will be such as to\nmeet the experiment requirements.\nCommand system. - The command system will be digital with a capacity of 128 discrete, redundant commands. The system will consist of\na digital command decoder and a transponder receiver. The command\nsystem will operate in the S-band frequency region which is in the\n2000 MHZ to 2300 MHZ frequency band.\nTransponder system. - A transponder is required for tracking, and\nrange and range rate information. The transponder consists of a command receiver and telemetry transmitter configured as a single compoent. The transponder transmitter will have a phase modulated output of\neither 2 watts or 10 watts. It will operate in the S-band frequency range.\nThe 2 watt output is fed to the high gain antenna. The 10 watt output is\nfed to the omnidirectional antenna.\nAntenna system. - A dual antenna system will be used on the spacecraft. The high gain antenna will be used to transmit telemetry data to\nthe LeRC ground station so that experiments can be conducted and evaluated directly from the LeRC. This operation is possible with a synchronous orbit spacecraft and is highly desirable in evaluating the class of\nexperiments to be performed with the spacecraft. The high gain antenna\nwill be a parabolic dish approximately two feet in diameter. Use of such\nan antenna will significantly reduce the power requirements and release\nsolar array power for experimental purposes. Because of the directivity\nof the high gain antenna (beam width approximately 16 degrees), any\nmisalignment in excess of approximately 7 degrees (such as during stationwalking using the radial thruster) or tumbling of the spacecraft would\nresult in loss of telemetry reception. Therefore, an omni-directional\nantenna is required. The omni-directional antenna is also required so\nthat spacecraft command capability is always available regardless of the\nspacecraft attitude. The omni-directional antenna will also be required\nin conjunction with the GSFC STDN network for positioning the spacecraft\nin synchronous orbit. The omni-directional antenna and transponder\n\n14\nsystem will be used in conjunction with the GSFC STDN network for range\nand range tate data. This data is required for orbit parameter\ndeterminations. A unique omni-directional S-band antenna design is required because of the configuration and dimensions of the spacecraft.\nElectrical Power System\nThe electrical power system will consist of the Solar Array, Battery,\nRegulation, Sensing and Distribution components.\nSolar arrays. - The solar array will consist of flexible fold-out panels\nthat deploy as shown in figure 2. A portion of the array (about 1/3) will\nbe wired and controlled to provide power directly to some of the electrical\nloads of the ion engines. The remaining array power will be wired to\nprovide a nominal 32 volts to the spacecraft power system.\nBattery. - A Battery will be required to provide power to the attitude\ncontrol system and the T. T. &C system during the shadowing periods or\nwhen solar power is lost.\nAn under voltage sensor will automatically shut down selected experiments and equipment when the solar array voltage decreases to a preset\nlimit. Overvoltage protection will also be provided.\nRegulator. - A Regulator will be used to provide a constant voltage\nin the electrical power system of the center body. A minimum dissipation switching regulator will provide a 1%voltage regulation at greater\nthan 90% efficiency. All spacecraft loads, with the exception of the ion\nengine loads operated directly from the array, will be powered off the\nregulated bus using conventional power processing techniques.\nA power control unit will handle the sensing, signal conditioning,\nand switching functions.\nIntegrated solar array power conditioning experiment. - The beam\nsupply of the two ion engines will alternately be supplied from solar cells\non the array configured to satisfy the voltage and current requirements\nof the beam supply. Voltage will be controlled by shorting switches in\nparallel with series strings of solar cells. These series strings will be\narranged in binary fashion with the smallest string sized to provide \xc2\xb11\npercent regulation of the beam supply. Four shorting switches will provide a range of control adequate for a 5 year mission. Diode protection\n\n15\nof the series cells will also be provided.\nThe ion engine accelerator supplies will be supplied alternately by a\nseries string of high voltage cells similar to those to be flown on the\nSPHINX satellite. The voltage will be controlled and series protection\nprovided by the use of zener diodes in parallel with the high voltage cells.\nThe beam and accelerator supplies can be used alternately with the\ntwo engines because attitude control and station keeping can be achieved\nusing only one engine at any given time. All other ion engine loads would\nbe provided using conventional power processing techniques.\n\nThermal System\nThe thermal loads encountered on TADPOLE are relatively modest.\nConsequently, a passive thermal control system will be adequate. Conventional surface coatings will be employed to control surface emissivity\nand absorptivety values. Super insulation will also be used as required\nto control component temperatures.\n\nHg Bombardment Ion Thrusters\nEither a 5 cm or 8 cm\ncontrol and station keeping\ncycles are required with a\nreliability is encountered.\n\nKaufman thruster is adequate for the attitude\nfunctions required of TADPOLE. Longer duty\n5 cm thruster and, hence, some reduction in\nThe 5 cm thruster is also less efficient than\nthe 8 cm thruster and would not be suitable for future spacecraft weighing\nin excess of 1500 pounds.\nSince the 8 cm thruster results in more conservative power and weight\nestimates, it was used for the initial preliminary estimates in this proposal. It should also be noted that the 8 cm thruster power requirements\nare easier to accommodate with the direct solar array power concept described. The 8 cm thruster characteristics and configuration are shown\nin figures 12, 13 and 14.\n\n16\nSpacecraft Size, Weight, Power and Cost Estimates\nThe TADPOLE spacecraft would be deVeloped using the protoflight\nspacecraft concept in order to minimize development cost. Estimates of\nthe cost along with estimates of spacecraft size, weight and power requirements are shown in figure 15. The cost estimates represent only\nthe R and D dollars required to develop the spacecraft.\n\nLAUNCH VEHICLE PERFORMANCE AND COST\nPerformance. - The auxiliary payload performance required of the\nTitan m C vehicle for the synchronous orbit mission considered could be\nas great as 900 pounds. This performance requirement presumes a 325\npound wieght for the auxiliary payload module shown in figure 3. It also\npresumes a 130 pound weight for the payload support truss and rail system. A requirement of 900 pounds exceeds by roughly 136 pounds any\ncapability presently listed in the "DOD Secondary Payload Space Catalog."\nMartin Marietta personnel have indicated that 150 pounds of additional\npayload capability could be achieved by optimizing the vehicle trajectory.\n\n\'\n\nHowever, this trajectory optimization is estimated to cost approximately\n600,000 dollars. Incorporation of a spacecraft weighing the order of\n445 pounds must be evaluated by the DOD before feasibility can be established.\nCost. - At the time Titan III C launch vehicle cost were discussed with\nMartin Marietta personnel there were no firm commitments to develop the\nauxiliary payload module shown in figure 3. However, Martin Marietta\nCorp. had made a fairly comprehensive study of the module and estimated\nits development cost at 1, 710, 000 dollars. Launch service cost on a\nshared basis were estimated by Martin Marietta personnel at 325, 000\ndollars.\n\nPROJECT COST\nThe estimated total project costs are shown in figure 16. The\nmethod of funding (or possible cost sharing) of the auxiliary payload\nmodule development, launch services and trajectory optimization is\n\n17\nnot presently known. The in-house manpower estimates are 250 man years\nwhich were priced at 38, 000 dollars per man year. It was assumed that\nthe spacecraft integration and testing program could be accommodated with\nIMS dollars. It should be noted that no contingency fund estimate is included in the project costs of figure 16. The preliminary spacecraft\nweight and vehicle performance estimates provide no weight contingency.\nA reasonable contingency of 15 percent would amount to 67 pounds for a\n445 pound spacecraft. A total Titan III C capability of 967 pounds is required before the mission can be given serious consideration. To be\nrealistic therefore, the trajectory optimization cost should be considered\na necessary part of the project cost. However, as discussed under "Performance" only a review by the DOD can establish the feasibility of\nthe mission and its total cost to NASA.\n\nMISSION OBJECTIVES\n\nI\n\nFlight proof of an ion thruster.\n\nII\n\nDemonstration of long term precision station keeping and\nattitude control with ion engines.\n\nIII\n\nDemonstration of inexpensive long term precision attitude sensing.\n\nIV\n\nDemonstration of an advanced power transfer and solar array\norientation system and its attitude control interactions.\n\nV\n\nDemonstration of integrated solar array power conditioning for\na useful load.\n\nVI\n\nProvide a synchronous orbit experimentation platform.\n\nVII\n\nDevelopment of a low cost synchronous orbit platform for\nsubsequent mission use.\n\nFigure 1\n\nORD~~r~lVEL\n\n_\n\nOeIK\nYAW\n\nVETO\n(ROI-\n\n/\n\nIv\n(I/IH\n\nFIUz\n\n4Rr1\n\n--- sSA 40\nAuxILIARY\nPAYLOAD\n\n-\n\n-Figure\n\n3\n\nsrA\n\n/.6\n\nDISTURBANCE TORQUE PEAK VALUES\n\nSOURCE\n\nROLL (FT-LB)\n\nPITCH (FT-LB)\n\nSolar Pressure\n\n1.06 x 10- 5\n\n2.7 x 10- 6\n\n1.06 x 10- 5\n\n---\n\n8 x 10\n\nMagnetic\n\nGravity-Gradient\n\n8 x 10\n\n- 7\n\n5.4 x 10\n\n- 7\n\n8.4 x 10\n\n- 9\n\nYAW (FT-LB)\n\n1.2\n\nx 10-10\n\nPropellant required for attitude control = 1.4 lb for 5 yrs.\n\nFigure 4\n\n- 7\n\nSTATION KEEPING PERTURBATIONS AND PROPELLANT\n(AV WHICH SYSTEM MUST DELIVER FOR 5 YRS)\n\nSOURCE\nLunar-Solar Attraction\n(North-South)\nEarth Triaxiality\n(East-West)\nSolar Pressure\n(East-West)\n\nPROPELLANT (LB)\n\nV (FT/SEC)\n\n4.6\n\n755\n\n29\n7.6\n45\n\nTOTAL\n\nFigure 5\n\n12. 2\n\nATTITUDE CONTROL AND STATION KEEPING SYSTEM BREAKDOWN\n\nWT.\n\nITEM\n\n(LB.)\n\nEarth Sensor (2-axis)\n\n8\n\nFine Sun Sensor (2-axis)\n\n4.5\n\nCoarse Sun Sensor (4\n\nPOWER (WATTS)\n\n15\n\n0.5\n\nSter.)\n\n4.0\n\nIntegrating Gyro\n\n30\n\nReaction Wheels (3)\n\nReaction Wheels Drive Elect\n\nAttitude Control Electronics\n\n15 (periodic)\n\n12\n\n3.0\n\n12\n\n3\n\nRate Gyro Package\n\n4\n\nBackup System Propellants, Tank\n\n15\n\n13 (intermittent)\n\n10\n\nBackup System Hardware\n\n10\n\nTOTALS\n\n8 (intermittent)\n\nFigure 6\n\n77\n\nPEAK\n\n41\n\n90\n\nSTEADY\n\nCOee-TloD\n\nJEC&CJT~tC~4,\nOi~ei7\nOEeT\n\nite-\n\n7T\n\n1\n\n*r-~\n\nFIIfE\nu cAs\n\nIAI\n\ntar,\n\nCor-)ic-\n\nION THRUSTER DUTY CYCLES\n\nOPERATION\n\nTHRUSTING TIME (HOURS)\n\nTIME BETWEEN\nTHRUST PERIODS (DAYS)\n\nRoll, Yaw Reaction\nWheel Unloading\n\n.17\n\n1\n\nPitch Reaction\nWheel Unloading\n\n1.5\n\n4\n\nNorth-South\nStation Keeping\n\n1.3\n\n1\n\nEast -
