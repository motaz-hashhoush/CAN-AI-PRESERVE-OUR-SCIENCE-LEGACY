The flexibility of forward and return links in future data acquisition satellites in handling varying missions and data rates to 1 Gbit/s is considered. Attention is focused on requirements for the NASA Tracking and Data Acquisition System. System components are described including the return link multiplexer, the return link transmultiplexer, the forward link multiplexer, the forward link demultiplexer, and the frontside/backside switch. Ping-pong buffers, which provide rate buffering for each input data stream, are discussed and justification bits, which handle variations due to Doppler shift and local oscillator variation, are considered. The time-division multiplexed streams consist of a unique synchronization word for frame synchronization, and control words associated with each data burst to identify the presence or absence of a justification bit. Redundant data paths are described for both forward and return data streams.", "title": "RF/optical interference design for optical intersatellite links", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-14T20:53:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19910043922, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Garlow, Ronald K."}, "organization": {"name": "COMSAT Laboratories", "location": "Clarksburg, MD, United States"}}, "id": "4b0afefc94e14bc7adf84a6834c3d0c6"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19910043922, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Campanella, S.
