Previous searches for these light echoes have used relatively short exposures with photograhic detectors. This paper reports on a search around eight recent novae with long exposures using a CCD camera. Despite an increase of sensitivity by over an order of magnitude, no light echoes were detected. It is found that the average grain density must be less than about 10 to the -9th per cu cm for distances from 0.1 pc to 1000 pc from the novae. The light echo around Nova Persei 1901 was caused by reflection off clouds with grain densities of several times 10 to the -9th per cu cm which are at distances between 0.1 pc and 10 pc. Echoes from dust in a circumstellar shell or ejected during a previous eruption will be effectively unobservable.", "title": "Light echoes - Novae", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-13T15:10:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19880043407, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Schaefer, Bradley E."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Goddard Space Flight Center", "location": "Greenbelt, MD, United States"}}, "id": "39b29a8e7a2840c3892f980d30b4ff24"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Reprint (Version printed in journal)", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-18T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19880043407, "sourceIdentifiers": [{"number": "doi:10.1086/166196", "type": "DOI"}], "publications": [{"volume": "327", "submissionId": 19880043407, "issn": "0004-637X", "id": "49a20add26aa422292ac7e5e4be1d437", "publicationName": "Astrophysical Journal, Part 1", "publicationDate": "1988-04-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
