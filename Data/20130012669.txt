b'bility, and programmability of a generalpurpose Manycore processor. This combination of an FPGA with a Manycore\nprocessor, with both components being\nconcurrently used for processing, has yet\nto be done for space applications.\nThis architecture is also useful for embedded robotic applications such as\nrovers. The FPGA/Manycore combination allows the end user to place tasks on\n\neither the FPGA or the Manycore\nprocessor, based on the strengths and\nweaknesses of each component.\nThis work was done by Carlos Y.

The assembly has the capability to generate an electronic pulse-position\nmodulation (PPM) waveform suitable for\ndriving a laser assembly to produce the op-\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, April 2013\n\ntical downlink signal. The downlink data\nenters the assembly through a serializer/\ndeserializer (SERDES) interface, and is encoded using a serially concatenated PPM\n(SCPPM) forward error correction code.\nThe encoded data is modulated using\nPPM with an inter-symbol guard time to\naid in receiver synchronization. Monitor\n\nand control of the assembly is via a low-voltage differential signal (LVDS) interface.\nThis work was done by Kevin J. Quirk,\nJonathan W. Gin, Adit Sahasrabudhe, Ferze\nD.
