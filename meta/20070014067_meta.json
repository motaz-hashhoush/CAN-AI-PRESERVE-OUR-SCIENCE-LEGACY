These activities have identified architectures and concepts that produce, preposition and store propellants in space for exploration and commercial space activities. Commonalities across mission scenarios for these architecture definitions, depot concepts, technologies, and operations were identified that also best satisfy the Vision of Space Exploration. The Boeing Company supported the NASA, Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) by conducting Architecture Definitions and Systems Studies. The primary objectives were: (1) determine high leverage propellant depot concepts and related technologies; (2) identify commonalities across mission scenarios of depot concepts, technologies, and operations; (3) determine the best depot concepts and key technology requirements and (4) identify technology development needs including definition of ground and space demonstration requirements. This presentation briefly summarizes potential ground and flight experiments and demonstrations as well as discusses various commercial and exploration applications of Cryogenic Propellant Depots.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20070014067, "endDate": "2007-02-15T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "Space Technology and Applications International Forum (STAIF) 2007", "location": "Albuquerque, NM", "id": "febd47c4586947999506b31f538fbe63", "startDate": "2007-02-11T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20070014067, "id": "031e48e8d507405abffcd3473939f30c", "publicationDate": "2007-02-15T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20070014067.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20070014067/downloads/20070014067.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20070014067/downloads/20070014067.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20070014067/downloads/20070014067.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
