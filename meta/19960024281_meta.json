Recently, due to the aft center-of-gravity (cg) locations on launch vehicles currently being studied, the need has arisen for the vehicle control augmentation that can be provided by these flight controls. Aerodynamic flight control can also reduce engine gimbaling requirements, provide actuator failure protection, enhance crew safety, and increase vehicle reliability and payload capability. As a starting point for the novel design of aerodynamic flight control augmentors for a Saturn class, aft cg launch vehicle, this report undertakes a review of our national heritage of launch vehicles using aerodynamic surfaces, along with a survey of current use of aerodynamic surfaces on large launch vehicles of other nations. This report presents one facet of Center Director's Discretionary Fund Project 93-05 and has a previous and subsequent companion publication.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19960024281, "id": "3cf3898ba36b4feab1ee69d37f7f39a3", "publicationDate": "1996-04-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19960024281.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19960024281/downloads/19960024281.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19960024281/downloads/19960024281.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19960024281/downloads/19960024281.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
