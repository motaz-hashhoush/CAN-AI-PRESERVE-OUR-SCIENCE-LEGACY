The SLM is one of the two laboratory modules which, together with two habitation modules, comprise the core elements of the SS reference configurations. Current project emphasis is to configure the SLM as a national science laboratory module facility which would have four major functions: maximize life sciences research potential, support operations of attached payloads, provide shirtsleeve environment for other payload instrument servicing, and support other science requirements. The design studies are focusing on outfitting a common module basic design to accommodate the four specific functions. Although design work for outfitting the SLM for life sciences research is underway, science requirements for the other sciences and functions are not as well developed.", "title": "Space station science lab module", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-12T18:04:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19860017675, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Devincenzi, D.
