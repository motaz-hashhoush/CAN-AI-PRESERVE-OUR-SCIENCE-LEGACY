These studies are\nessential to providing "ground-truth" support for observations of the solar system by\nNASA\'s missions, including the Voyager and Calileo spacecraft, the Hubble Space\nTelescope. and the proposed CRAF-Cassinimission. Complementary spectroscopic\nobservations of comets were added in BY88 to support NASA\'s cometary program goals\nmission. A very modest laboratory effort is also maintained to\nof the CRAF-Cassfni\nprovide essential data needed by these observational programs, which may be otherwise\nunavailable.\nM a i n accomplishments during BY88 include: (1) Discovery of HDO in the spectrum of\nMars and the first determination of the D/H ratio in its atmosphere; (2) Completion and\npublication of our study of CH3D in the spectrum of Titan and a determination of the\nmixing ratio in its atmosphere: (3) Completion of our observations of CH3D in the\nspectrum of Neptune and a preliminary analysis of the CH3D/CH4 mixing ratio in its\n\natmosphere.\nMajor efforts proposed for BY89 include: (1) Completion of our analysis of CH3D in the\nspectrum of Neptune and a determination of the CH3D/CH4 ratio in its atmosphere, as\npart of our groundbased support of the Voyager mission encounter with Neptune in\n1989; (2 1 Search for HDO in the atmosphere of Venus a s part of our investigation of the\ndistribution of deuterium in the solar system and its relationship to the origin and\nevolution of the planets: (3) Completion of time series of spectrophotometric\nobservations of Neptune and a determination of its geometric and Bond albedos a s part\nof our study of temporal variability of its atmosphere, in preparation for the 1989\nVoyager encounter: (4) Publication of the recalibration of the Sun against Vega and\ncontinuation of our study of the fundamental calibration problems associated with\nsolar analogs, needed to accurately determine planetary albedos on a common\nphotometric scale: (5)Continuation of our times series of spatially resolved spectrophotometric observations of the Jovian belts and zones to characterize the spatial and\ntemporal variations of the Jovian atmospheric structure in support of the Galileo\nmission.\n\n83\n\n1!\n\nI\n\ni\nI\n\nj\n\nI\nI\n\nI\n\ni\n\nI\n\nPAPERS PUBLISHED IN REFEREED JOURNALS AND MEETING\nPROCEEDINGS IN BY 1987/ 1988\n\n\'The Solar System/Interstellar Medium Connection: G a s Phase Abundances" (invited\nreview, B.
