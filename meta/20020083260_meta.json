It is applicable to a wide range of situations. The technology was originally developed by Inference Corporation for Johnson Space Center's Advanced Software Development Workstation. The project focused on the reuse of software designs, and Inference used CBR as part of the ACCESS prototype software. The commercial CBR Express is used as a \"help desk\" for customer support, enabling reuse of existing information when necessary. It has been adopted by several companies, among them American Airlines, which uses it to solve reservation system software problems.", "title": "Problem-Solving Software", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-20T23:12:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-09-08T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20020083260, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20020083260, "isbn": "0-16-038211-4", "id": "074edbbca57e4131b5fbe527d727d78e", "publicationName": "Spinoff 1992", "publicationDate": "1992-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20020083260.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20020083260/downloads/20020083260.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20020083260/downloads/20020083260.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20020083260/downloads/20020083260.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
