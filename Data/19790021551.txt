Scientifically, the polar regions have surfaced as major drivers\nin global climate, weather, and ocean processes. This dual economic/\nscientific resurgence has caused the governments in the polar regions to\ndevelop and expand polar services in support of exploration-and-exploitation\noperations scheduling, navigation and hazard avoidance, environmental forecasting, and conservation and environmental-quality management. Because of\nits ihterests in Alaska, the Great Lakes, and the Antarctic and our operation\nof the International Ice Patrol in the North Atlantic, the United States\nhas both a major investment as a nation and a major responsibility due to\nits influential role in the polar regions.\nIn this study we have reviewed these present and projected benefits\nand have translated them, where not already officially documented, into\ninformation needs to support the array of polar activities anticipated.\nThese needs include measurement sensitivities for polar environmental data\n(ice/snow, atmosphere, and ocean data for integrated support) and the pro-\n\n.\t\n\ncessing and delivery requirements which determine the effectiveness of\nenvironmental services. An assessment was made of how well we know how to\nconvert electromagnetic signals into polar environmental information\n\na=\n\nan emphasis on the status of scientific understanding and algorithm develop!\t\n\nment. The array of sensor developments in process or proposed were also\nevaluated as to the spectral diversity, aperture sizes, and swathing capa-\n\ny\t\n\nbilities available to provide these measurements from spacecraft, aircraft,\nor in situ platforms. Global coverage and local coverage densification\noptions were studied in terms of alternative spacecraft trajectories and\nY\n\xc2\xb0\t\n\naircraft flight paths. Mechanisms for centralizing all processing or\n\n\t\ni\n\ne\n\na\n\ni\nr\n\ndispersing a major portion of the cost to the users themselves were discussed and compared. Sample implementation schemes utilizing minor modifications to NOSS or TIROS, an optimized NOSS-based pseudo-operational polar\nservices platform, a new NASA polar research satellite, U.S. participation\nin an internationally managed polar research/services satellite, and an\nexpanded aircraft and in situ program were developed to help expose additional\npolicy issues and potential problem areas.\nIn order to summarize the results of this effort, an attempt has been\nmade to select out from a fairly massive array of information those policy\nissues of major importance at this stage in the possible evolution of a NASA\npolar monitoring development program. There are other issues or questions\nin the main text, generally of a more technical nature, but it is believed\nthat most of these can be better stated once some initial guidelines are\n\n4 .,\n\nestablished for the issues developed here. The following issues were selected because of their potential effects on user relationships and funding\nrequirements:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nShould there be a polar region focus for an environmental\nmeasurement mission?\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nAre agency, industry, or science interests dominant in the\npolar regions?\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nCan and should an ice/snow environmental measurement program\nbe separated from one for ocean and atmospheric measurements?\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nHow should international interests be handled?\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nHow aggressively should sensors be developed specifically\nfor polar region utilization?\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nWhat is the best platform/trajectory combination for achieving\ndesired polar coverage?\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nIf a satellite program is warranted, then what implementation\nmode provides the best combination in terms of low cost and\nuser responsiveness?\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\xe2\x80\xa2^\t\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nIt is not our intent to try to answer any of these questions, but only\nto lay out some of the options and as many of their implications as we were\nable to uncover.\n\n5\n\n\t\n\nt\nt\n\n1\n\nIt is generally accepted that for there to be a program focus on any\nparticular user group there should be a definable and visible user commun-\n\nI\n\nity, a fairly large and recognized potential benefit from the program, and\na user community that is willing to vocally support the program in front of\nCongress and the various administration review bodies and to back this\n\nsupport with investment of their own.\nThere are three definable and visible user communities in the polar\nregion: science, industry, and government. The scientific community is\n\nr.\n\nprimarily concerned with the leading role the polar regions play in global\n\nx^\n\nenvironmental dynamics. Detailed knowledge of the growth and dynamics of\n\nr\n\nice and snow systems is needed to understand more fully the way in which\nthey affect global climate, weather, ocean, and hydrological balance.\n\n.R\n\nIndustry also needs to understand these same polar processes to achieve\nefficient operations in the exploration for and exploitation of major\noil and gas and fish protein reserves. Government agencies also have a\ngreat need for polar information since, in addition to participating in\npolar research, they also have a social services role that is partic-\n\nularly important in the polar regions. Direct government support to\nindustry and science includes polar navigation, search and rescue, and\n\nenvironmental forecast services.\nThe potential benefits from improved environmental measurements in\nthe polar regions appear to be generally recognized by those involved with\npolar activities, but poorly understood by the pertinent decision - making\np\t\n\nbodies. Polar researchers and polar climate researchers comprise an enthusiastic but comparatively small group relative to those engaged in atmosphere, ocean, or land research. Recent efforts have shown that the polar\nregions may be the key to some of the problems in these other areas and\nsome of these other researchers have been migrating to polar studies. Oil\nand gas profits could potentially be effected in the hundreds of millions\nof dollars category each year for each company engaged-in polar activities\n\n^ \t\n\nif the environmental information we-,= available to 41low them to extend\n\ni\n\n6\n\nr\n\ntheir tanker shipping season and improve scheduling of their operations.\nThe agencies providing these environmental measurement services (NOAA/Navy/\nCoast Guard) understand the need for continuing and expanding their present\nservices, but have expressed a need to further assess the user market prior\nto engaging in extensive and complex new development efforts. Such an\n--\t\n\nactivity is presently ongoing.\nAll of the above factors affect user community willingness to vocally\nsupport a focused program. Polar scientists are willing to express their\ninterests, but they are a small group, relatively, and are not well represented on many of the national scientific advisory groups that guide our\nfunding policies for NASA, NOAA, and other agency research programs.\nAlthough NSF and ONR do have a focused polar region program, again the\nlist of participants is surprisingly small compared to other areas. Arctic\noil and gas interests are willing to talk about their needs comprehensively\nand can show extensive investment of their own to obtain environmental information to support navigation and operations scheduling needs. However, they\nshy away from formally requesting government support in obtaining this\ninformation more efficiently. Their excuses for this behavior are centered\naround government regulatory pressures, the effect written requests of any\nkind have on exploration site lease acquisition, and the advantage to marginal\ncompetitors resulting from government-furnished polar information. They\nhave, on the other hand, discussed putting up support satellites of their\nown. If there was any mechanism to get government permission for such a\nlaunch, they would do so for they recognize that such an action would provide a good return on investment. In the meanwhile, they are investing\nextensively in improved aircraft and in situ measurement support and, in\nmany regions, have considerably more information on the environment than\ndo the government agencies with operational environmental information\nresponsibility. The polar region industrial experiments in SEASAT-A comprise a major portion of the total industrial experiments effort and again\nindicate the strength of their interests.)\n\n1 "SEASAT-A Industry Demonstration Program (ASVT Program)," Volumes I and II,\nJPL, June 1, 1977.\n7\n\n\t\n\nMeanwhile, the agencies with operational responsibilities in the polar\nregions do not appear particularly responsive at the higher management\nlevels to polar interests. NOAA generally provides global information\nservices on a global scale and with coarse resolution. This is what is\nneeded to drive environmental forecast models, and the coarse resolution\nscale fits present computational capacities (as always, fund limited).\nThe polar users have data needs for finer surface resolutions, which imply\nmajor increases in computational capacity beyond ar+y presently anticipated\nbudget the support agencies might have. Industry, in particular, whose\nmajor benefits come in local Arctic or coastal areas, often feels that\nNOAA products haven\'t reached adequate surface resolution levels to be\nused extensively for the localized problems, of the polar or coastal regions\nexcept in a very limited fashion. As a result, NOAA sees less customers\n\n1.\t\n\nthan it might in the polar regions, and many of the polar and coastal users\n\n1-\t\n\nare disgruntled with NOAA\'s inadequate (to them) funding. The Navy, also,\n\nw\t\n\nhas encountered many of the same problems. Although it operates a major\nportion of the Joint Navy/NOAA Ice Survey Office (five of six people),\nand has considerable operational interest in the Arctic, the environmental\nmeasurement and forecast effort in the Arctic is not considered a main\nthrust activity in the Navy. The Navy recently had a broadly attended\ninternal meeting on polar environmental information needs and appears to\nhave concluded that Navy requirements were not sufficiently focused to\nwarrant support to any major new thrust. The Coast Guard supplies extensive service in the Arctic regions and the Great Lakes and operates the\nInternational Ice Patrol in the North Atlantic. But they, too, do not\n\n--\t\n\nyet appear convinced that satellites would do them any more good than\n\n-\t\n\noutfitting their airplanes (which they have to have for other reasons)\nwith improved environmental sensing packages. Based on their needs alone,\nout of context with the other needs, they may be right.\n\n.-\t\n\nThe problem, then, is that there are viable user groups with large\npotential benefits, but their interests are generally not given high\npriority, in our present fund-limited climate, by the agencies set up\nto support them. However, based on the many technical and cost uncertainties in implementing such a program, and the often missing or\n8\n\ncontroversal documentation of benefits, the agency positions are not\nunreasonable. NASA appears to have a needed role in evaluating these\nuncertainties and developing program alternatives that meet they industry\n-\t\n\nand science needs and satisfy agency concerns.\n\ndustrv, Or Science Interests Dominant In\nar\ns-\t\na\n\nPolar research is actively supported by NSF, ONR, the Army\n\nCRREL,\n\nand\n\nthe USGS. Some of NASA\'s polar environmental research subprograms under\n-\t\n\nthe Oceans Program have been integrated with these external research efforts\nso that there is a good awareness in the polar research community of the\n\nt _\t\n\nopportunities afforded by\n\nS.ASAT-A\n\nand NOSS. GSFC has been the ma3or\n\n(especially the imaging radar), NIMBUS-G,\nNASA\n\ncenter working on scientific efforts,\n\nand their IPACS mission [Ref. 18] reflects these science interests (e.g.,\nemphasis on new measurements and on resolutions that are not quite as fine\nas those of interest to operational users in order to ensure that processing\ndemands are more consistent with expected limits in budget).\nPolar industries have a tremendous heed for environmental data, but\ntend to be reticent in asking the government to supply such information.\nThey are actively pursuing the\n\nSEASAT -A\n\nopportunity and have made extensive\n\ninvestment of their own in environmental measurement facilities; much more\nis needed, however. Harnessing their independence is a challenge. NASA\nmight want to undertake to place the polar mission on a firm support foundation by establishing a direct industry investment for some portion of the\nmission. LeRC and JPL have emphasized industry users, and their mission\ndeliberations reflect the needs of this user group.1,2\n\n1 P.J. Rygh, et al., "National Oceanic Satellite System Definition Phase,"\nFinal Report, Volumes 1 through 3, JPL Internal Report 624-12, June 16,\n1978.\n2 Richard T. Gedney and Ronald U. Schertler, "Microwave Systems for Monitoring\nSea Ice," Presented at WMO Workshop on Remote Sensing of Sea Ice,\nWashington, D.C., October 18, 1978.\n\n9\n\nI\nI\n\nPolar government agencies presently have a relatively low interest, but\ncould potentially play a major role if a program were developed to support\nscience and industry interests. As discussed earlier, the agencies involved\nin supplying present polar services are supportive to industry and science\nneeds; however, three major problems limit their support. First, they are\ngenerally too small to command a significant share of their agency\'s support.\nSecond, many of the unanswered technical questions limit their effectiveness\nin presenting the case. And third, the suborganizations with operational\nresponsibility have to make too large a capability jump either in using\nspace-derived data, if that is the best source, or in pr,)cessing the volumes\nof data actually needed from whatever source is appropriate (space or aircraft or in situ). This capability jump implies changes in budget which\nare difficult to obtain in today\'s climate.\nExtensive interaction is needed with agency personnel to document\ntheir concerns and interests if NASA wants to develop a program focus in\nthis area. The science and industry interests appear to be there for\nharnessing, but agency reticence needs to be addressed. More in situ\nand aircraft tests are needed to shed light on agency concerns with the\nviability of some measurement types and with the magnitude of the pro-\n\n-\t\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2-\t\n\ncessing implied by the resolutions needed.\n\nCan And Should An Ice/Snow Environmental Measurements Program\nBe Se parated From Ones For Ocean And Atmos pheric easurements\nThere are two aspects to this issue. First, many of the dynamics of\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2-\t\n\nthe ice/snow system in polar regions are controlled, or at least strongly\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 influenced, by conditions at the water and air boundaries. The water and\natmospheric systems not only furnish water or take water from the ice/snow\nsystem, but they also move the ice/snow around due to wind, wave, current,\nand tidal actions. Thus, to understand the dynamics of the ice and snow\ns\n\nsystem, it is necessary to understand the ocean and atmosphere interactions.\nSecond, many of the sensor techniques to measure ice and snow properties are the same as those to be used for these ocean and atmospheric\nmeasurements. Thus, the same sensor used to determine ocean surface and\n10\n\nt\ncloud temperatures can be used or adapted to measure ice/snow surface\ntemperature. Radar images, altimetry, scatterometry, etc., measure ice\nbut the measurement concept is essentially identical. In other cases,\nthe horizontal resolution needs are a little bit finer, but again it is\nonly the scale not the concept.\nIt would thus appear that the ice and snow disciplines are excellent\ncandidates for an integrated environmental observation approach utilizing\nshared sensors flying on a limited number of common orbits. Where there\nr..\t\n\nis any unique requirement demanding other than a reasonable multidiscipline\ncommonality approach, it appears very possible that aircraft would be\nexcellent candidates for obtaining special measurements due to the limited\n\n.\t\n\ngeographical extent of the U.S. Arctic interests.\n\nHow Should International Interests Be Handled?\nThe Canadians and Europeans have both studied polar spacecraft missions.\nThey have much more extensive Arctic interests than we do and have expressed\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\ninterest in some form of cooperative venture to provide environmental\n\n,-\t\n\nmeasurement services for this region. Preliminary informal meetings have\nalready been held at which the mutual interests and mutual advantages\nderiving from a cooperative effort have been identified.There are several subissues in this area. The first evolves out of\nthe fact that the fourth major interest in the Arctic region is-Russia.\nThis makes the military very interested in Arctic environmental measurement\nprograms, especially when the major sensor of interest is the imaging radar.\nFurther study needs to be made of how military interests in Defending the\n\ni\t\n\npolar- regions can complement oil and fisheries interests in exploiting the\npolar regions.\nThe second subissue arises once the first one is settled. If the\ncooperative international program option was chosen as the proper way to go,\nwhat should be the U.S. role in this cooperative venture? A brief comparison was made of the U.S. role as a leader with Canadian and ESA participation versus a U.S. role as a participant with Canadian or ESA leadership.\n11\n\nIBased on U.S, interests in being a l eader in space, the first appears appropriate. Based on the smaller U.S. share of the polar regions and more\nrecent interests in sharing expenses more broadly with our fellow men,\nthe second role seems desirable. A thorough evaluation of these options,\nhowever, is beyond the scope of this report.\n\nHow Aw ressively Should Sensors Be Developed Specificall\n\nAt present, the investment in polar specific sensors is small. Th_\ninvestments projected in the near term for the NASA polar-environment\nsuhprogram l are limited to testing the utility of sensors developed for\nother purposes rather than making unique spectral changes or developing\nunique new concepts for polar application. Downstream, l there are some\nc 1forts directed towards special measurement capability for ice and snow\nthickness but, by and large, the funding levels are barely sufficient to\nmaintain a viable program. If it is accepted from the discussion of the\nfirst issue that a viable user activity exists, then NASA should take a\nmuch more dynamic approach to the support of technique developments for\npolar research and operations. Potential areas of research are discussed\nin Section V. These include visible, infrared, and microwave radiometric\nsurface mappers with more optimum channel selection and finer surface resolutions; atmospheric sounders with special channels for the ice/snow boundary\nas well as for the ocean boundary; new radar and LIDAR altimetry sensors\nwith narrow beams for surface profiling, MHz frequencies for ice thickness\nsounding, etc.; and new wide-swath imaging radars with 100-m capability\nplus more narrow-swath options with 20-m resolution (as desired by Canada\nand ESA) or with 5-m resolution (the long-term industry desire) for navigation and iceberg identification support. In addition, a wide variety of\nnew sensors appear on the horizon with improved frequency diversity, finer\nfootprints, and broad application to other environmental disciplines.\n\n1 "Sensor/Ice Dynamics Interaction and Modeling Subprogram Plan," NASA\nLewis Research Center, May 5, 1978 Revision.\n\n12\n\nWhat Is The Best Platfo Trajecto!7 Combination For Achieving\ni\neessi- ia Polar Coverage\nFor the combination ofresearch( climate,\t ice dynamics, etc.), military\nresearchclimate\nY\t\n)\t\nY\noperations, and international industrial operations, it would appear that a\nsatellite implementation for monitoring the polar regions is the best comprehensive solution. If military interests limit the real-time accessibility\nof this information ".o industry, then an alternative airplane solution may\n\nbe appropriate for the U.S. industrial community due to the limited area of\nparticular interest to U.S. companies.\nFor the satellite implementation, there are three orbits of interest.\nThe strictly polar orbit option (83- to 87-deg inclination) covers the\nentire pole with the fine resolution imaging radar and gives good systematic\ncoverage of both poles if the side from which the radar looks out is switched\nin the northern and southern hemispheres. This is the most popular orbit\nfor the widest range of users. The sun-synchronous orbit is only of interest for the visible spectrum sensors utilizing reflected polar energy. For\nthe most part, these are the same sensors and spectral channels of interest\nto lower latitude users, so little is needed other than directing the data\nthrough processing capabilities using algorithms specifically focused on\npolar regions. The cloudiness of the polar regions also limits the utility\nof these sensors.\nThe third orbit of interest is the orbit creating greater time density\nx\t\ni\n\nof coverage in local polar areas. The example used in the main text is the\n69-deg inclination orbit for aiding access to the north slope of Alaska.\nOther inclinations might be important for other local regions of interest.\n\ni\n\nThis local densification orbit concept may not be practical unless there\nare other local areas covered by the same orbit, since airplane implementations may be able to effectively compete with satellites on local coverage.\nA well-instrumented aircraft is required, also, to provide ground truth\nsuppert, to provide increased coverage densification in local areas for\noperations or research, and to visually check out phenomena identified by\nthe sensor package in real time. In situ measurement packages with data\nrelay capability also have a role in polar regions.\n13\n\nt\nThe question of satellite, airplane, and in situ roles and the selection of the most practical user responsive orbits need to be studied in\nmore depth with a user advisory group having a technical rather than a\npolicy orientation.\n\nIf A Satellite Pro g ram Is Warra\nsiveness\nMuch of the relatively off-the-shelf sensing capability for polar\nregions could be accomplished with relatively minor modifications to\nexisting designs for NOSS, TIROS-0, and OMSP-Block 6. These differences\nare primarily spectral channel changes or additions, but in some cases\ninclude increases in aperture sizes to achieve finer surfs\xc2\xb0e resolution.\nThe problem with this solution is that these three satellites are dominated\nby global modeling users, and there appears to be little interest in satisfying the broad array of polar users.\' Fine resolution images and realtime information availability have not been of particular interest to the\noperational-agency management and, in fact, a concern with potentially\nlarge processing costs caused removal of the imaging radar from NOSS wh"n\nthe imaging radar was a key sensor for polar and coastal interests.\nThus, a separate satellite system with more research and industrysupport emphasis might be appropriate. This satellite might look more like\nthat proposed for the GSFC IPACS mission, but could contain a broader array\nof sensors or could even be built into their more general Platforms for\nApplications Research (PAR) concept, which uses 84- to 87-deg and 55- to\n75-deg orbits for supporting research in many disciplines while exploring\nindustry benefits and evaluating new sensors with potential operational\nroles. Neither the IPACS nor PAR concepts needs be more expensive as a\nmode of operation than the alternatives. This depends, of course, on the\ncomplexity of payload carried, the ability to use previously proven hardware, and access to experienced personnel. The data processing system,\n\n\'The coastal users have the same problem.\n14\n\n\t\n\non the other hand, could probably be designed to be considerably more\nsupportive to research and industry users than the NOSS and TIROS and DMSP\n\nsystems. Foreign participation could also be solicited.\ny\t\n\nA final potential implementation option is to provide U.S, support to\na basically international satellite implementation led by Canada or ESA,\nboth of whom have more extensive polar interests than the U . S. Our share\nof this international goodwill adventure should be much less than the\n^-\t\no\t\nw\t\n\ninvestments implied by the other U.S.-controlled options. The international\nsystem will probably go ahead without us, in which case we would miss the\nopportunity to share in the data base generated.\'\n\n15\n\nt\n\nI. BACKGROUND AND PROBLEM\n\nThis work has been performed by System Planning Corporat;on (SPC) under\nthe auspices of the Advanced Ocean Mission Development Working Group, which\nis composed of representatives of each NASA center involved in NASA\'s ocean\nprograms. The effort is the result of an Applications Notice award and is\nfunded through the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). The technical monitor\nis Dr. Edwin Sherry. The membership of the Advanced Ocean Mission Development Working Group included:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nDr. Edwin Sherry, NASA JPL, Coordinator\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nMr. S. W.

The specific task included an assessment of the\npresent user interfaces at JPL, GSFC, and LeRC; collection of a cohesive\nset of requirements based on the work done by JPL, GSFC, and LeRC and any\ndocumented agency positions; an assessment of the state of the art in\nsensor, satellite, and data systems to meet the identified requirements;\nand an evaluation of alternative implementation options, including the\npotential impact of international participation.\n\n16\n\nI\nThe JPL scientists consulted in this effort included Dr.harle s\nC\t\nElachi (ice dynamics research), Dr. Atul Jain (radar sensor options),\nMr. Johnie Driver (trajectory options)., and Dr. Edwin Sherry and Mr. Pat\nRygh (spacecraft and implementation options). The scientists at GSFC who\nwere consulted included Mr. Fred Flatow, Polar Satellite Study manager,\nDr. J. Nally, polar science manager, and Dr. Jerry Eckermann, microwave\nsensor manager. At Lewis Research Center, we consulted with Dr. Richard\nGedney concerning polar research and applications programs. Dr. Gedney\nprovided us with extensive documentation on Lewis polar activities and on\nthe Lewis ice dynamics subprogram plan. It is important that this mission\neffort be tied to the ice dynamics subprogram plan. The long-range goals\nof this subprogram are "to determine and characterize remote sensing\nmethods and sensor combinations capable of measuring ice properties at the\nnecessary temporal and spatial frequencies."\n\n17\n\nII. USER BENEFITS FROM POLAR MONITORING\n\nThe polar regions have generated considerable interest in recent years.\nEconomically, our view of the polar regions has been changed drastically by\nthe discovery of substantial oil reserves in the Arctic and by the reaffirmation that the Arctic and Antarctic regions have large, relatively untapped\npopulations of marine fish for food and fertilizer. This new economic\ninterest has spurred the government to initiate services in the areas of\nice breaking, iceberg hazard avoidance, polar weather forecasting, polar\nfauna and flora protection, etc. The recognition of the importance of the\npolar regions to such factors as weather, climate, ocean dynamics, and\nhydrology has similarly given impetus to polar research. A summary of the\neconomic, social, and scientific activities in the polar region is given\nin Figure 1. This chapter provides a brief examination of the economic,\nsocial, and scientific benefits achievable through polar monitoring. Further detailed information can be found in the references.\n\nA.\t\n\nECONOMIC (INDUSTRY) BENEFITS\nThe oil companies have moved i n.fn the Arctic en masse. The United States\n\nhas major operations on the Alaskan north slope. The Canadians are exploring the area from Alaska to Newfoundland. The Europeans are exploring Norway\nand Sweden. At all of these locations, information about atmospheric and\nocean conditions and ice motions is necessary for scheduling of drilling rigs,\ntankers, and pipelines and for ascertaining the effects of transportation\nchoices and scheduling. In the Alaskan area, 2 weeks of additioi.al surface\ntransportation of oil by tanker is purported to affect a company\'s yearly\nincome in the $100M category. Multiplying this by the number of companies\ninvolved and the number of other locations where good ice-edge and ice-lead\nnavigation data can affect the length of the transportation season presents\n18\n\nGREENLAND\nt\n\n14^\n\nPOLAR SOCIAL SERVICES\n\nPOLAR SCIENCE\n\nICE BREAKING\nICE FORECASTING\n\nPOLAR ECONOMICS\n\nICE DYNAMICS\nCLIMATOLOGY\n\nICEBERG HAZARD PROTECTION\n\nPOLAR HYDROLOGY\n\nOIL AND GAS OPERATIONS\n\nPOLAR MAMMAL/BIRD PROTECTION\n\nPOLAR BIOLOGY\n\nTANKER OPERATIONS AND DESIGN\n\nPOLAR SEARCH AND RESCUE\n\nWEATHER FORECASTING\n\nSHIP NAVIGATION AND ROUTING\n\nWEATHER FORECASTING\n\nMARINE FISHERIES OPERATIONS\n\nMILITARY OPERATIONS\n\nPOLAR IMPACT ON\nWEATHER FORECASTING\nPOLAR IMPACT ON OCEAN\nDYNAMICS\n\nFIGURE 1.

Improved data on iceberg\nformation in the Labrador current region could save several ships a year\np\t\ns\'\t\n\nfrom damage or loss due to iceberg enc ounters. Bet ter information\t would also\no ld\nu\t\ntt\ng\t\ng\t\nallow more use of shorter routes across the Atlantic by St. Lawrence Seawaybased vessels. More extensive information on Arctic oil and gas operations\nand Arctic tanker and ship routing can be found in the ECON SEEASAT-A Economic\n\n9\n\n\t^-\t\n\nBenefit Study [Ref. T] done for NASA several years ago; more detailed case\nstudies en Arctic oil have been performed by Battelle [Ref. 2]; and tanker\nship routing studies [Ref. 3] have been conducted by Ocean Rou ges, Inc.,\nand JPL. In addition, several of the SEASAT-A industry experiments are\n\nt\n\ndirected toward validating the benefits of improved Arctic data on Arctic\noperations and tanker routing [Ref. 4]. Also, one of the industry experiments addresses the design criteria for tankers traversing the Arctic waters\n[Ref. 4].\nThe Arctic and Antarctic areas are growing sources of fish protein\nfor man, animals, and agricultural fertilizer. Use of real-time nformation by the extensive fisheries operations in the Bering and Labrador Seas\nand in the North Atlantic could help to improve catch efficiency and reduce\nequipment losses and loss of life\'and fishing boats. Some estimates of\nthese impacts are provided in the ECON report [Ref. 1] and in the Fisheries\nCase Study done by JPL [Ref. 5]. The king crab fisheries in Alaska have\ndevised a SEASAT-A industry experiment to validate the benefit of better\nice-edge motion data on the ability to retrieve king crab traps before\nthe moving ice destroys the surface buoys [Ref. 4].\nLewis Research Center is the major contributor to the present work\nbeing done on industrial interactions in the polar region. The people\nat this center have participated extensivel y with shipping and oil\ncompanies in Great Lakes and Alaskan surveillance tests. LeRC has also\norganized ice ridging experiments, investigated ice thickness measurements,\naided industry in design of SEASAT-A experiments, and has generally been\navailable for industry consultation. Battelle Memorial Institute has also\nbeen active in Arctic industry interactions, through NASA support contracts,\nin the areas of economic benefit case studies and the SEASAT-A Industry\n\n20\n\nExperiment Design. JPL, too, has worked closely with industry in Arctic\nresearch, particularly with the oil companies in the area of imaging\nradars. It has developed a series of experiments for the fisheries and\ngoose management industry. GSFC has also worked with industry, but has\nbeen involved primarily with scientific issues. Lan- l ey Research Center\nand Wallops Flight Center have participated primarily \'n ice and snow\nprofiling and scatterometry research in the Arctic region to obtain roughness and thickness data.\n\nB.\t\n\nSOCIAL (GOVERNMENT SERVICES) BENEFITS\nThe U.S. Coast Guard operates the International Ice Patrol in the\n\nNorth Atlantic and has extensive responsibilities for icebreaking in\nAlaskan waters and in the Great Lakes. Means of improving the efficiency\nof Coast Guard operations and the benefits to be derived from such improvements were addressed by the ECON report [Ref. 1] and several of the Arctic\nand iceberg-water industry experiments for SEASAT-A [Ref. 4].\nThe Navy and NOAA operate a joint ice monitoring office that provides\nnavigation data for Arctic and Antarctic shipping. This effort could benefit from improved polar information. The requirements of each in the\nArctic region are addressed in References 6 and 7, respectively. A recent\nNavy meeting has provided an upgrading for some of these requirements,\nbut to date this report has not been released. The joint Navy/NOAA\nice monitoring effort in the Antarctic appears to be the only available\nnavigation aid for krill and Antarctic fishing and for supplying the\nAntarctic stations of various countries.\nIn the area of polar search and rescue services, benefits are possible\nthrough space surveillance systems. Such systems would benefit a wide spectrum of military and civilian agencies, in particular the Coast Guard. However, the present efforts to establish a space-based search and rescue system\nfor general application can probably be adequately utilized in the polar regions.\nThere has been renewed interest in recent years in management of the\nlimited living land resources in the Arctic and preservation of wildlife.\n\n21\n\nParticular attention has been given to land and water mammals such as\npolar and Kodiak bears, caribou, walruses, seals, whales, and other polar\nmammals, which from time to time are threatened with extinction. In\naddition, the understanding of the process of freeing Arctic valleys from\nsnow at the time the Canadian goose nests provides an important input into\nthe Bureau of Fish and Wildlife management programs that have the responsibility for establishing the bag limit for hunters each year [Ref. 4].\nThe polar region is also important to military operations. Extensive\nenvironmental data are needed by the services to allow proper application\nof strategic and tactical strategies. Survival of personnel, operation\nof equipment, and ireserving communications are real problems in the Arctic.\nLewis Research Center has again taken the lead in working with the\noperational side of the agencies. Their success with Project Icewarn and\nother joint programs with the Coast Guard in the Great Lakes and Alaska\nhave given them excellent credibility [Ref. 8]. JPL has worked with the\nCoast Guard on ice navigation in Alaska and iceberg detection off Greenland,\nprimarily in the area of imaging radar. JPL has also worked with NOAA, USGS,\nand the Army Cold Regions Research and Engineering Laboratory (CRREL). GSFC\nalso has strong ties with NOAA, USGS, and CRREL, but primarily from the\nresearch standpoint.\n\nC.\t\n\nSCIENTIFIC (BASIC UNDERSTANDING) BENEFITS\nThe polar regions act as major end points in the dynamics of our planet,\n\nboth in the long-term climate sense and in the shorter term weather and ocean\ncirculation sense [Refs. 9 and 10]. In climate, the poles are recognized as\nmajor sinks in the total system. They act as drivers of the planetary fluid\ncirculations and radiate much more energy into space than they take in from\nthe sun. In addition to these longer term influences in terms of ice ages,\netc., the poles make large contribution; to our global weather. Understanding\nhow a major portion of U.S. weather is generated over Siberia and then\nproceeds across the Bering Sea tr Alaska and beyond is a critical task. \'Why\nthis weather goes inland and down into the plains states or south to\n\n22\n\nWashington,\nand Northern\ni s the\no f many studies\nWashington, Oregon, and Northern California is the subject of many studies\nand investigations (e.g., Ref.\nand investigations (e.g., Ref. 11).\n\nThe area off research in ice dynamics is well covered in Reference 12.\nThe area o research i n i c e\nis\ncovered i n Reference\nI n this\nIn this area, it is important to understand the deviations from locall isoit is\nto\ndeviations from l o c a\nstatic equilibrium, especially relative to ridging.

USER NEEDS FOR POLAR ENVIRONMENTAL INFORMATION\n\nAfter conferring with a wide range of people concerning their needs\nfor polar data and their present and planned acquisition and use of it,\na list of separable polar-environment disciplines was derived (sae Table 1).\nIndustry, to achieve economic benefits, needs environmental forecasts of\nfour scales (ice, weather, storm, and ocean), cumulative average and 100year maximums for engineering design, and fish management and exploitation\ninformation. Government agencies, to achieve social benefits, provide the\ninformation base for environmental forecasts, provide a management and\ncontrol function for the fisheries and pollution monitoring, and provide\nsupport for tactical and strategic military operations. The scale (spatial\nresolution and frequency of repeat) desired by industry and often used\nlocally in their own systems is often an order of magnitude or more finer\nthan that considered feasible by the service agencies. Real time is the\nkey for industry. Science, in general, utilizes non-real-time analysis of\nreal-time data and generally needs an order of magnitude more resolution\nthan do the operational systems to identify the next level of conceptual\ndetail for the new generation of operational models.\nThe difference in scales between disciplines is important to keep in\nmind even in the polar region since it helps in understanding the differences\nin payload complexity evolving out of different NASA centers and different\nagencies, depending on what discipline group dominates their advisory activity. The scales used in the polar region activities, as derived from later\ntables, are shown in Figure 2. Global weather is central in that the NOAA\nTIROS, Air Force DMSP, 1 and NOAA/Navy/NASA NOSS 2 scales are designed for\n\n1 Defense Meteorological Satellite Program.\n2 National Oceanographic Satellite System.\n\n24\n\nTABLE 1\n\nDISCIPLINES WITH SEPARABLE NEEDS\n\nEconomic\t\nSea Ice Forecasts\nSea Ice Research\nGlaciology & Hydrology\nClimate\nGlobal Weather Forecasts\nSevere Storm Warning Forecasts\nCoastal Ocean Condition Forecasts\nPhysical Ocean Research\nOcean/Ice Engineering\nLiving Marine Resources\nBiological Ocean Research\nOcean Contamination\nTactical Military Operations\nStrategic Military Operations\n\n25\n\nSocial\n\n1000 km\n\n100 km\n\n\t\n\nCLIMATE\n\nZ\nQ\n\nGLOBAL WEATHER\nSEVERE\nSTO R MS\n\n^ 10 km\no\n\nW\nQ\n2\nZ\nO\n\nTIROS, OMSP, NOSS\n1 km\n\nC7\n\nMILITARY\n\nJ\nQ\nw\n\nui\ncr-\n\nPOLAR\nOCEANS\n\nICE\nFORECAST\n& RESEARCH\n\nw 100 m\n\n2\n\nJ\n\nPOLAR\n\nHYDROLOGY &\nGLACIOLOGY\n10 m\n\nI\t\n\n1 ml\t\nMINUTES\t\n\nI\t\n\nI\t\n\nI\t\n\nHOURS\t\n\nDAYS\t\n\nWEEKS\t\n\nMONTHS\t\n\nI\t\n\nYEARS DECADES\n\nTEMPORAL SCALE\n\nFIGURE 2. ENVIRONMENTAL SCALES FOR POLAR DISCIPLINES\n\n26\n\nI\n\ntC:\n\nglobal variations of weather, oceans, and ice. Polar ocean research, engineering, and biological resource management are more locally oriented in\nlinear scale. Climatologists are sa\'isfied wicn the coarser areal (linear\nsquared) resolutions, generally, but need them averaged over long times and\nwith sensitivities that allow differentiation between very small changes in\nthe average values. The severe storm warning and tactical military operation\nareas require very quick data turnaround, a requirement that cannot be met\nat the present time. Ice dynamics, forecasts, and research require a wide\nrange of scales, but tend to need finer linear resolution to differentiate\ndeformations, drift, leads, icebergs, etc. Polar hydrology and glaciology\ndisciplines require fine resolution that can be averaged over long times.\n\nA.\t\n\nMEASUREMENT REQUIREMENTS\nIn order to provide the p olar environmental information base for all\n\nof the disciplines evaluated, all of the measurements listed in Table 2\nwould have to be addressed. The list of ice measurements shows only a\npart of the problem. Growth and increase of the ice and snow levels\ndepend on complex ice/air, ice/ocean, and air/sea interactions. These\ncan only be evaluated if both sides of the interactive interface are\nmonitored. Therefore, a list of atmospheric and ocean parameters was\nalso developed to complete the set.\nReferences 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 1\t\n\n14, 15, 16, and 17 were then evaluated\n\nto extract a set of measurement requirements for the polar regions. This\nset of requirements for the ice, atmosphere, and ocean measurements is\nshown in Tables 3, 4, and 5. The measurement requirement for each discipline is given in terms of the measurement precision, the horizontal and\nvertical resolution, and the temporal repeat needed. Two values are given\nfor most requirements: the most difficult value desired and the minimum\nuseful value. The referenced source or sources are provided in the lower\nright-hand corner of each box. Where no reference is cited, the measurements\nwere extrapolated by the authors based on similarities with other parameters\nthat had referenced values. Where no values are given and the box is not\ncrossed out, it was felt that some value should be !pprnpriate, but that no\nsatisfactory rationale for extrapolation came to mind.

In\n1 to 3 hours, the atmosphere, the ocean, and sea ice can change drastically,\neither preventing or delaying operations, navigation, lobster pot retrieval.\netc. This means that n ,,wcasts and forecasts are needed on short turnaround\ntimes, preferably in less than 1 hour; but delivery in less than 3 hours\nis acceptable under some conditions. Government control functions such as\nfish management and pollution control also benefit from near-real-time\ninformation, but daily sources are adequate as a rule. In order to maintain efficient control, however, violators must be identified and contacted. This implies that too much ti , ie cannot be allowed to elapse\nbetween the measurement and the analysis and display. Military operations\nrequire extremely short processing and delivery times for both strategic\nand tactical purposes.\nScientific analysis is often conducted based on hindcasts and does not\nusually require real-time data delivery. The major interest of the scientist\nis to have all of the archives easily accessible to him at a price affordable from NSF, ONR, or other g rants. Climate, glaciology, hydrology, and\nocean/ice engineering disciplines, in addition, require information that\nis averaged over long periods of time. Thus, some archiving capability\nthat averages the data taken over several different time cycles to preserve\n\n32\n\nan understanding of the seasonal, diurnal, and other temporal cycles could\nbe of great benefit to ongoing research in these areas. The distributions\nof deviations about these averages are also important.\n\n33\n\ni1^\n\nIV. POLAR MEASUREMENT STATUS\n\nThe array of measurement requirements presented in Tables 3, 4, and 5\nare imposing and illustrate how difficult it is to assess the ability to\nmake each measurement, to place priorities on the measurement based on their\napparent utility, and to assign the sensors derived to satellite orbits or\naircraft flight paths depending on the coverage required and sensor feasibilities. Tables 6, 7, and 8 match the present satellite remote sensor capability\n!\t\n\nto these requirements in terms of polar ice, atmosphere, and ocean properties,\nrespectively. Required capability is taken by summing the columns in Tables 3,\n4, and 5. No attempt has been made to prioritize the different levels of\nrequired capability since it is Difficult from our perspective to assign relative importance to disciplines. The present capability was derived from\nthe listed capabilities for each of the sensors on existing flight systems\nor soon to be launched sensors [see Ref. 19]. The acronyms for the spacecraft sensor systems are defined in Table 9.\nThe proposed capability is a combination of that proposed by GSFC\n[Ref. 181, JPL [Ref. 201, LeRC [Ref. 211, Canada [Ref. 22], and ESA [Ref. 231.\nIn general, the capabilities proposed do not represent high-risk developments.\nMany are but adaptations of existing sensors, while others, though new to the\nsatellite, are well demonstrated from aircraft flights. In order to evaluate\nthe proposed capability, it is useful to discuss the measurements in terms\nof groupings of physics problems. As noted in Reference 19, measurement\noptimization tends to differ depending on whether the process being measured\nis thermal, convective, water cycle, chemical/biological, texture, or special\nfeature oriented.\n\n34\n\nTABLE 6\n\nPOLAR ICE MEASUREMENT CAPABILITIES COMPARISON\n\nNegu iced Capability\n\nPrecision\n\nMeasu. e.ent\n\n: bn\n\ntonlal\n\nleasporal\n\nVertical\n\nVertlul lce /: n- Te a l,\t\n\nProfit?\n\nPolar Revlon Altwdu\n\n0 I G7 C\n\nSW talk.\n\n-\n\n(I I"GI\xc2\xb0C\n\n5. / 251 n\n\nloo / L\n\no.71/3t\n\n1../Sao.

For\natmospheric emission, then, it is important to separate out the effects of\nvariable composition, aerosols, and water content and to use variable sensitivity on the absorption bands of some major atmospheric constituent like\noxygen to develop a series of absorption extinctions in depth, in order to\ndetermine vertical profile. For selected frequencies, emitted energy below\na certain altitude will be reabsorbed by this higher atmosphere and will\nnot be received at the satellite sensor. The trend is thus towards narrower\nbandwidths to get these sensitivities. In the infrared, wave numbers (oa/a)\nof the order of 0.01 are appropriate if the surface air temperatures at the\n6-m altitude reference level are desired. Present sensors have wave numbers\nof about 1, and the proposed capability in Table 7 is for a sensor (currently\nbeing developed at JPL) with a wave number of about 0.1. Resolutions of\n25 km are consistent with presently available optics sizes and these narrow\nbandwidths. Pressure profiles can be similarly developed by utilizing\npressure-sensitive frequency bands in this same absorption extinction fashion or by using reflected laser energy on and off absorption bands with\ndiffering pressure sensitivities.\nSurface emission measurements similarly have to deal with atmospheric\nlosses and with surface emittance effects due to roughness and, occasionally,\ncomposition. Four to six infrared or microwave channels, if well chosen,\ncan usually be used to make these separations. Four are presently suggested\nby GSFC for improved sea surface temperatures; one or more additional channels would be useful to better account for ice and snow roughness effects\nplus the tendency of ice and snow to absorb and emit in depth rather than\nat the surface. Since wider bandwidths are allowed for these measurements,\nfiner surface resolution can be obtained for the same detector sensitivity\nlimits. Infrared sea and ice surface temperatures can thus be measured to\n\n3s, but suffer from too large\nresolutions on the order of a kilometer or le ,\n39\n\n\t\n\ni+\n\nan error in cloudy skies. The present microwave surface mapping sensor\nsystems with five channels, similarly, would need additional channels to\naccount for ice/snow emittance differences. The microwave is desirable from\nthe point of view of better sensitivity to atmospheric water, but suffers\n\n^\xe2\x80\xa2 from lack of availability of channels. Channels must be selected from those\navailable by international agreement or suffer from periodic saturation when\npassing by communications channels in that frequency regime. In fact, some\nr-\n\n!\t\n\nof the channels in the existing microwave surface mapper are not up for\napproval in next year\'s international meeting to establish bandwidth allocation. Subsurface ice temperatures are not presently feasible from space.\n\nSome success with ocean vertical profiles has been acquired using laser\n1.\t\n`\t\n\nspectral extinction techniques. The ability of ice and snow to emit in\n\n(\t\n\ndepth can provide some separable information on temperature profile, but\n\n1\t\n\npresent research is not sufficiently advanced to provide useful correlations.\n\nB.\t\n\nCONVECTIVE PROCESS MEASUREMENTS\n\nMotions are primarily derived from time series images or from doppler\n\nI\t\n\nshifts in the signals from active sensors. Time series images are used to\nrecord slow moving ice motions and their drifts and deformations. Small\nchanges require fine resolution and, since cloud cover is typical in the\npolar reflections, synthetic aperture radar images are needed to see through\nclouds. Canadian and ESA studies ERefs. 22 and 231 show resolutions of 20 m\nj\t\n\nto be necessary. NASA studies show resolutions as low as 5 m to be important\nfor some uses, but suggest a 100-m compromise in order to allow a wide swath\n\nfrom a single sensor and "reasonable" data rates. This compromise is driven\nby science interests and agency cost concerns rather than industry interests,\nwhich tend to favor Canadian and ESA recommendations. Time series images of\ncloud motions are used similarly to infer wind motions. Because the motions\n\nare more rapid, the scale can be compromised and resolutions of 1 km (similar\nto the infrared thermal mapping) are adequate.\nDoopler techniques for determining surface velocities are under study.\nShip and plane motions appear on radar images and suitable analysis could\nprovide velocity. The use of doppler techniques to study water motions is\nalso of interest, but these do not offer suitable sensitivities at present.\ns.\n40\nZ\'\n\nLaser and radar sounding of the atmosphere also p rovides some doppler data\ndue to aerosol and cloud motions. This is under study also, and a test of\nthe concept could be made if an experimental atmos p heric laser or atmospheric\n\nT.\nli\nf\n\nradar sensor is included in the payload.\nSeveral more indirect measures of velocity are also utilized. North/\nsouth currents cause localized bulge3 in the ocean surface due to Coriolis\neffects. Altimetric techniques can determine the height of these bulges,\nand mass velocities can be derived. Similarly, wind-shear-caused surface\nroughness on the water can be measured with scatterometers or with microwave\nradiometers. This roughness measure can be interpreted upward to indicate\nsurface wind velocity and downward to indicate surface layer transport.\n\nC.\t\n\nWATER CYCLE MEASUREMENTS\nHumidity is just another major atmospheric constituent, and appropriate\n\ndevelopment of the IR/uw atmospheric thermal and pressure sounder mentionel\nearlier will also provide a humidity profile. Precipitation is somewhat\nmore difficult. Microwave radiometric techniques have been successfully\nused to identify areas of rain and have been used with mixed success to\nquantify the rain. Radar systems are sensitive to precipitation and conceptually could determine all of the precipitation parameters noted in Table 7.\nThese rain radars, under development at GSFC and LeRC, are limited, however,\nby the availability of suitable frequencies. An experimental sensor needs\nto be flown in space.\nFog or mist visibility may be derivable from the 0.01 wave number\nsounder, but is also detectable with suitable laser wavelenqths. Lasers\nsuffer from the difficulty of their space implementation. The utility of\na laser for this use alone would not justify it unless the frequency of\ninterest had a wide ranqe of other uses. An experimental laser was suqqested\nby GSFC, but more work is needed before the wavelengths are chosen.\nThe extent and thickness or depth of sea ice, sheet ice, and snow cover\nare impor i ,nt to global weather, navigation, climatology, polar hydrology,\nand glaciology. Extent and fraction cover are easily Grossly determined by\n\n41\n\nr\n\nl\n\npassive microwave mapping to resolutions of about 1 km. Finer detail can\nbe derived from the imaging radar.\nThickness of sea\t ice and depth of sheet ice on glaciers are more difficult to determine.\t\n\nSingle layers of freshwater ice have been measured with\n\nS- and L-band altimetry.\ntained debris\t increases,\ni\nL.\n\nAs the layering becomes more complex and the consensitivities drop off.\n\nSimilarly,\t variable\n\nsalinity\t in saltwater\t ice makes\t interpretation difficult if not\t impossible.\nIt may be possible to determine sea ice even with salinity to thicknesses\nup to 1 m with S-band or L-band systems, but much more experimental\t work is\nneeded.\t\n\nStudies such as Reference 24 imply that megahertz frequencies\t\n\n(10 to\n\n300 MHz) may provide adequate sensitivity, but more experimental verification\nis needed. Megahertz active radars in space require very large antennas if\nground resolutions are to be "reasonable." Some experiments measuring sheet\nice thickness using a swept frequency microwave radiometry have been made,\nbut success was limited by the same layering complexity effect.\n\n\'\t\n\nD.\t\n\nCHEMICAL AND BIOLOGICAL MEASUREMENTS\nIce is of little interest in obtaining chemical or biological measure-\n\nments, except perhaps in the determination of sea ice age from salinity\ncontent. Microwave radiometers have been successfully used to measure this\nto adequate sensitivities.\nOcean chemistry and biology do affect the interaction between the two\nsystems and the viability of the fish resources in the polar regions.\nColorimetry (multispectral, narrow bandwidth radiometry in the visible and\ninfrared regions) has been broadly used from aircraft to measure chlorophyll,\nnutrients, phytoplankton, turbidity, etc., and a space demonstration of this\ncapability is planned for NIMBUS-G. The s p ecific frequencies of interest\nto the polar regions are only partially the same as those of the NIMBUS\nsensor. Sea surface salinity has been measured from L-band (n,1.4 GHz)\nradiometry and from sea glitter using visible channels. Salinity does not\n_\t\n\nappear important enough in polar regions to warrant a separate L-band radiometer development, but the colorimeter could be used in a glitter mode with\nrelatively minor modifications to the scanning optics.\n42\n\nPetroleum and fish oil extent appears well in synthetic aperture radar\npp\t\ne\t\ny\t\nc pert e\nimages and often in colorimetry. These materials change the surface roughness which affects the amount of reflected energy seen by the radar or the\ncolorimetry and, in the case of the colorimeter, compositional variations\nchange the fraction absorbed by the surface in different wavelengths.\nTyping and thickness measurements have been made from aircraft using laser\ne\t\n\nsystems. Choice of frequency appears to be important since absorption or\n\nfluorescence effects are often specific to layers from different sources\n(oilfields or fish). Again, some experimental effort is needed, but a program has been initiated at LeRC to explore this problem [Ref. 25]. This\nproblem is not unique to the polar region; neither are any of the chemistry\na\t\n\nand biological measurements.\nThe final chemistry measurements are in the atmosphere. Ozone and\n\ni.\ncarbon dioxide have a major effect on radiation balance in the polar regions,\nz\t\n\nand this needs to be determined at high latitudes. NIMBUS-G and UARS 1 have\n\naddressed this atmospheric constituent problem for these and for a wide\nvariety of natural and man-induced trace constituents thought to be important\nto the chemistry involved with atmospheric radiation balance. Downward looking absorption techniques have had some success for these major constituents,\nbut there is a longer range trend towards continuous-wave (CW) and pulsed\nlaser systems. Use of matched line pairs on and off an absorption line\nprovide very sensitive measures of constituent concentrations in the upper\natmosphere using CW lasers. Pulsed lasers are needed to extend the technique\ndeeper into the troposphere through application of similar concepts. The\nUARS [Ref. 261 and Shuttle LIDAR [Ref. 27] reports provide good detail on\nthese techniques. Again, the problem is not peculiar to the polar region;\ntherefore, inclusion of pulsed lasers on a polar satellite may be questionable\nunless there are physics reasons that indicate a need for a shared orbit.\n\n1 UARS - Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite.\n\n43\n\nx\n\nJ\n\nE.\n\nSURFACE AND IN-DEPTH TEXTURE MEASUREMENTS\nSurface texture in ice relates to both top and bottom roughness due to\n\nridging, dislocations, and storm erosion. Ocean roughness in terms of waves\nand tides also affect edge erosion and dislocations. Radar and laser altia\t\n\nmetry provide the best measure of surface roughness. Ocean wave roughness\nand other surface height oscillations have been measured with. radar on\nGEOS-3 and SEASAT-A. These are essentially pulse-limited techniques in\nterms of the surface resolution being related to the wave height. For ice,\nthe roughness is so much greater that pulse-limited resolution becomes too\nlarge for the scale of interest. This means either that very large antennas\nand higher frequencies (if beam limited techniques are to be undertaken with\nradar) are necessary or that switching to laser implementations is needed to\nget better beam control. The laser implementation suffers from loss of\nmeasurement capability due to cloud absorption. The larger altimeter antennas\nsuggested in the more ambitious NOSS report [Ref, 20j thus help the ocean\nsurface roughness determination, but do little for ice since the footprint\nis still pulse limited. Because many of the users require only monthly\ncoverage broadly or daily coverage in local areas, this technique may prove\nmore advantageous for aircraft implementations. In addition, since roughness has been shown to respond best to radar wavelengths of the same relative magnitude as the roughness, it may be that L-band or megahertz (10-to\n300-MHz) altimetry implementations will prove more beneficial than the\nexisting X-band (spacecraft) and S-band (aircraft) sensors presently under\nevaluation.\n\nF.\n\nSPECIAL FEATURES\nSpecial features primarily involve location and identification of point,\n\nline, or areal features. In polar regions, ship locations, leads, thin ice,\nice edges, and icebergs all have to be choreographed for efficient navigation. The synthetic aperture radar appears to do a good job in this area,\nproviding accurate locations, observation through clouds, and small feature\ndetection. Ships, icebergs, and leads are sufficiently different in reflectivity from the surrounding material that they are usually easily detectable\nin resolution cells much larger than their size.\n44\n\nTop feeding fish, seals, walruses, and whales have been observed to\nmodulate the surface of the water when they feed or travel near the top\nsurface. Systematic studies to quantify the effect of this modulation and\ndistinguish it from background noise have not been undertaken and indeed may\nprove infeasible or impractical from space. There are similar problems\nassociated with identifying polar mammals from space. In the management of\nthese animals, it is sometimes adequate to identify environmental conditions\nconducive to their proliferation in order to infer population pressures.\n\t\nr.\n\nThus, caribou need thin snow to stomp up the foods they need from the land\nunderneath, and Canadian geese need certain valleys to be free from snow at\nthe proper time in order to lay their eggs and hatch their eggs in time for\nthe fall migration south. These types of problems are not strong enough by\nthemselves to warrant special sensor developments for ice missirls, but\nrelevant data could be obtained peripnerally using sensors that are designed\nfor other purposes; e.g., a goose management experiment was planned utilizing\nSEASAT-A radar images [Ref. 4].\n\n45\n\nI\nt\nr.\nV. SENSOR STATUS\n3\n\n:\xe2\x80\xa2 Many of the sensors needed for polar monitoring are available today\nand, with slight modifications in the spectral bands, could be optimized\nfor ice properties rather than for atmosphere, ocean, or land use. Most\nof the new sensor concepts are centered in the active sensors, whether\nthey be laser or radar based. In this section, we will look at passive\nand then active sensors, starting with microwave and working towards the\nultraviolet. For each sensor type, a comparison will be made between\nexisting systems and those proposed by GSFC, JPL, and LeRC in their studies.\nOther possibilities that need consideration will be suggested where appropriate. A key connecting the requested measurements with generic sensor\ntypes is provided in Table 10.\n\nA.\t\n\nMICROWAVE AND MILLIMETER WAVE RADIOMETERS\nMicrowave radiometers have the advantage of being able to make surface\n\nmeasurements in the presence of reasonably heavy cloud cover. A comparison\nof existing and proposed microwave surface mappers is provided in Table 11.\nThese appear useful for measuring ice/snow/glacier extent and coverage\nfraction, ice ace and salinity, gross sea ice drift rates, ice/snow/water\nsurface temperature, surface wind stress, and rain and cloud water content.\nThe 6.6-, 10.69-, 18-, 21-, and 37-GHz channels represent current satellite\nflight experience. Inclusion of an L-band channel (ti1.4 GHz) has some\npotential for surface soil moisture, and inclusion of several frequencies\nabuut the oxygen band at 55 GHz provides an important adjunct to the\nimproved infrared atmospheric sounder. The addition of the 94-GHz channel\nprovides finer surface resolution for determining ice extent and coverage\nfraction and some improvement in atmospheric water determinations.

In fact, a Navy study indicates 10 m to be an appropriate size. The 4-m choice of NOSS apparently\n\naddresses a combined NOAA/Navy requirement that established 25 km as the\nlargest useful resolution cell for temperature in the next development phase.\n\nThe 3-m aperture shown was chosen to meet science and climate requirements\nwhere temperatures with 50- to 100-km resolutions are adequate.\nThere are two problems with the sensors suggested that we feel require\n\nfurther investigation. First, the 10.69- and 18-GHz channels, with bandwidths\nof interest, are not being proposed in next year\'s international WARC meeting\nas radiometer channels for operational systems. Either the proposed allocation needs to be changed or alternative channels need to be developed. In\nthe process of looking for alternative channels, a second problem arises.\nThe 6.6- through 37-GHz channels were selected to optimize on sea surface\ntemperature, sea surface roughness, and atmospheric water content within the\nlimits of channels that could be used for experimental radiometry. For ice\noptimization, the atmospheric water window (4.25 or 6.6 GHz) and atmospheric\n\nwater (18 and 21 GHz) channels a p pear to be similar. The channels for measuring water surface roughness (10.69 and 37 GHz, nominally) may not be\nthe same as those needed to deal with ice and snow roughness and with the\n\nfact that both ice and snow tend to emit and reflect extensively in depth\nrather than at the surface. Optimizing for an ice surface temperature is\nthus a much more complex problem, and research is needed to show which\n\nchannels aid interpretation more than the present array.\nThe microwave atmospheric sounders are also shown in Table 11. These\nsounders p rovide atmospheric temperature and humidity profiles plus an\nIindication of the amount of precipitable water in the clouds. Recent\nstudies [Ref. 26] have shown that good matchin g with radiosonde data can\nbe achieved when the 0.1 wave number infrared sounder is combined with a\n!.\t\n1\t\n\nfew microwave channels. The microwave channels remove a major uncertainty\nwhen they are viewing the atmosphere at relatively correspondent times with\nthe infrared signals. What channels are needed and in what quantity are\nstill not adequately established.\n\nI^\n\n^\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\n49\n\nI\nI\nI\n\nSwept f r equency microwave radiometers have been flown on aircraft\nwith a limited number of frequencies. LaRC presently has one for aircraft\nuse. Ore of the interesting applications has utilized the variable emittance\nover \'ce and snow with frequency. This has been related to ice and snow\ndepth. As with other ice and snow thickness-measuring concepts, to be\ndiscussed later, this technique turns out to be very sensitive to layering,\nsalinity in the ice, and surface roughness. Unique interpretation has not\nbeen demonstrated under these conditions. For this reason, the swept frequency radiometer has not been recommended for present satellite payloads.\n\n0\n0\na\nr\nn\nF,\nn\n\nB.\t\n\nVISIBLE AND INFRARED RADIOMETERS\nA wide range of visible and infrared radiometers has been shown to be\n\nuseful for ice and snow measurements as well as for atmospheric and ocean\nmeasurements. These applications are summarized in Table 10. A summary\nof an appropriate sample of the available sensor design concepts in the\nvisible and infrared radiometer regime are provided in Table 12. Polar\nregion albedos and net radiation balance can be measured w \t\n\nwide band\n\nradiometers similar to those used for the earth radiation budget sensors.\nActive cavity and other radiomete:s with improvements in radiation sensitivity are under development and are to be included in later versions as\ntheir improved capability is demonstrated on the ground and in Shuttle\nflights.\nInfrared atmospheric sounders have received recent attention. Present\ninfrared atmospheric sounders have wave numbers about two orders of magni-\n\nr\n\ntude above those needed to make good vertical profiling, especially near\nthe surface. A sounder with one order of magnitude improvement has been\nproposed by JPL and was included as a desirable demonstration option by\nJPL and GSFC proposals for early Shuttle flights. The need for this sensor\nis only incidentally related to polar measurements.\nA thermal and cloud mapper is flown on TIROS-N. This AVHRR-I\n\nr\n\nbecomes AVHRR-II on about the third or fourth flight. The AVHRR-II has a\nthird infrared channel, which improves the surface temperature measurement.\n\n50\n\nfi\n\nI\n\nTABLE 12\nPOLAR VISIBLE AND INFRARED SENSOR COMPARISONS\n\nWavelengths or Wave N\xe2\x80\x94hers\n\nSensor\n\n11.2\t to\t So\t\n\nAtuospherit\t Sounder\n11AS-11\n\n669,\t 680,\t 690,\t 703,\t 716,\t 133,\t 14S,\t 900,\n1030,\t 1225,\t 1365,\t 1488,\t 2190,\t 2210,\t 2240,\n2270,\t 2360,\t 2515,\t 2660,\t 14,500 cm - 1\n\n101I\n\nNCISS\t (Ref.\t 20)\t\n\nI6 \xe2\x80\xa2 4(_`-\t\n\nIRrt\t\n\nThernWI/ Cloud\n\n(11)\n\n15110),\t 8(7),\t 5.i(7),\t 4.2(6),\t 3.9(3)\t cm -1\n\n18)\n\nII\n\nV\n\nSian\nAngle\n\nEffective\n,wdth\n\n3.74,\t\nCPR\n\n18):\t\n\n10.8,\t\n\n12.0\t\n\n..e\n\n5 km\n\nu.7,\t 0. 1.\t 1\t I,\t 1. 6.\t 11.0\t .,n\n3.74,\t 3.5,\t 10.8,\t 12.0\t ,mi\n\ncm\n\n411\t Y.m\n\n1.0\t (.\n\n\t Co" sition Kapper\n\nh\t\n\nIPACS (Ref.\t 18):\t 11MS\nSurface\t _Co_mhusttion\n\n3,\t 9.b,\t I1.3,\t\n\n15.0,\t 15.0\t i.m\n\n.25/0.1\t C\n\n\xe2\x80\xa230\'\n\nSO\n\nZO cm\n\n1/10\t kin\n\n20 cm\n\n2Ym\n1/5 km\n\n1SOO\t\n\n2DI1 Iw\n\ni.4\t pExn\t 1120\n\nr\n\nCnnler\n\n71GU\t Ym\n\n40\n\n1-4\t im\n\n\xe2\x80\xa240\'\'\n\n4 km\n\nkill\n\n1500\t kin\n\nCross-track\n\nCros:-tra(.k\n\n18011 km\n\nCooler\n\n[jam\n\n0.441,\t 0.52,\t 0.55,\t 0.75,\t 0.67,\t 11.5\t ,.ni\n\n17.13 cm\n\n825 in\n\n\xe2\x80\xa240\'\n\n1500 km\n\nCross-track\n\nNOSS (Ref.\t 20):\t CICS tiitension\n\n0.443,\t 0.463,\t 0.52,\t 0.55,\t 0,515,\t 0.60,\n0.67,\t 0.75\t ..m\nSame\n\n17.78\t cm\n\n825 m\n\n\xe2\x80\xa240\'\n\n1500 km\n\nCross-track\n\ni0 cm\n\n4116\t n:\n\n^40\n\n1500 km\n\nPushbroom\n\n20 cin\n\nCCO Version\n\n,urfaceFeature_ Kapper\nKSS\n\n0.45 to\t 1.0\t\n\n80 m\n\n1P5\t kin\n\nWBV\n\n0.45\t to 0.7\t ,.n\t (3 1\n\n40 in\n\n185 km\n\nTM\n\n0.45\t to\t 2.35\t ur\t\n\n30 m\n\nNIS km\n\nm\t (4)\n\n(5)\n\n-tereo Surface Mapper\n\nGlitter/Polarization Ka\n-pper\nSane astTCS extension\n\n( ) refers to the number of channe,s in that wavelength regime.\n\n.W\n\nRemarks\n\n.49.5\n\n-3 km\n\n15.5\n\n.5/0.25\'C\n\nView\nAngIe\n\nHorizon:\n\nKapper\n\nNCISS\t (Ref.\t 20):\t AVHRR-11,\nAt-\n\nlffectIve\t HrsoIUtion\n\nS88,\t 627.5, 635.8, 646.65,\t 652.15,\t 666.0,\n661.0,667.5,668.7,1203.0, 1772.0,1784.5,\n1789.5,\t 1809.5,\t 1939.4,\t 1850-9,\t 1881.7,\n2012.5,\t 2381.5,\t 2383.75,\t 2386.1,\t 2388.2,\n2390.2,\t 2392.35,\t 2424,\t 2498,\t 2616 cm - 1\n\nABIS\n\n4VH0R=1j\nIPACS\t (Ref.\t\n\n\xe2\x80\x9eni\t\n\nAperture\nSize\n\nI\'\n\nsiltation Budget Kapper\n\nOi\n\n1\'r er.ision\n\nGlitter\nalso\n\nIn NOSS, a third version was suggested by GSFC, adding a channel in the\n8.5-um region to again improve surface temperature. The fourth infrared\nchannel is easily added within the existing sensor design [Ref. 20]. The\ntwo numbers for precision and surface resolution given represent the precision at the resolving limit of the system, 1 km, and the improved precision if many of these small resolution cells are averaged. The Cloud\nPhysics Radiometer (CPR) suggested in the GSFC study was inserted more for\naddressing climate needs, but provides improved determinat = on of cloud\nwater. Neither sensor is probably adequate for the full spectrum of polar\n\nC\n\nmeasurement needs. Some combination is probably apprc;;riate t:) handle\nboth cloud properties and surface temperatures. For surface temperatures,\nsome additional channels might also be appropriate to separate out the\neffects of emittance in depth from snow if small surface indications of\nmelting, etc., are to be adequately identified as they begin happening.\nStudies in this area need to be made or applied to this problem if already\naccomplished.\nThe only atmospheric composition mapper shown in Table 12 is a limb\nsounder (LIMS). A better sensor might be the spectrometer of ATMOS, but its\nsize and complexity make it more suitable for Shuttle implementation. A\nnumber of other implementations have been flown on NIMBUS or are proposed for\n\nr\nf\nr.\nr\n\nERBSS-A. These are either earth looking or sun occultation pointing, but\nfor a limited selection of trace species. LIMS was also flown on NIMBUS,\nbut the suggested addition of an active cooler would make the sensor much\nmore effective. LIMS is again climate oriented in the IPACS-suggested design\nand provides important input for stratospheric dynamics, both in the climate\nscale and in the scale for shorter term stratospheric pollution effects.\nLIMS appears to be an inadequate mechanism for obtaining ozone and carbon\ndioxide information at the poles. \t\n\nSun occultation measurements are too\n\ninfrequent at the poles using the orbits of interest to build up measurement statistics of use to but a relatively small user group. If only\nozone and carbon dioxide were of interest, then more limited earth-looking\n\nt\n\nsensors would be more appropriate; with cooling, these could also be\ndesigned to attain the necessary sensitivities. Laser heterodyning technologies have also advanced far enough to allow for their reasonable\n52\n\nI\n\n\t\n\nI I\n\nimplementation, providing the number of species to be evaluated is limited\n\ni\n\nE\n\nto those of critical interest in the polar region. Active LIDAR sensors\n\nmay replace these passive composition mappers later due to their potential\nfor improved sensitivities. A simple demonstrat i on of a limited version\nof that system might be even more desirable, but the polar mission aspect\n\nn\n\nis incidental.\n\nSurface composition mappers like the coastal zone color scanner are\nalso useful for fishing and pollution management in the polar regions.\nThe 825-m resolutions of the present coastal zone scanner need to be\n\ndropped to a 400-m resolution just to satisfy the NOAA/Navy longer range\ninterests, but could equally well benefit from a drop to the 100-m resolutions of interest to the fisheries industry in polar waters. The NOSS\n\nversion is probably adequate for this time period, especially if the frequencies were adjusted Tightly to address specific polar- fishing environ-\n\nments and pollution species. For polar mission purposes, it would probably\nbe more effective if flown in a LANDSAT-type orbit with near-noon Equator\ncrossings in a sun-synchronous orbit.\n\nThe major features and capability of the glitter/polarization mapper\n^.\t\n\nare identical to those of the surface composition mapper. \t\n\nIts added capa-\n\nbility would primarily be a secondary mirror system that allows tracking\nalong a sun glitter angle on several wavelengths, which may or , ma y !rot be\nwavelengths in common with the choices without glitter. \t\n\nIn this development,\n\nthough, it would be better to implement the sensor , on a NOSS orbit so that\n^-\t\n\na variety of sun angles could be investigated to allow determination of the\nbest orbit for the measurement. The existing optics ystem designed to help\navoid glitter could be used to effectively maximize it over- some portions of\n\nthe trajectory.\nThe surface feature mappers and stereo feature mappers are not described\nhere. LANDSAT and STEROSAT developments apuear adequate for this use. It\nis probable that there mi g ht be a better set of wavelengths for, polar measurements, but their value is lim{_ed compared to the synt`ietic aperture radar,\n\nwhich does not have the same ciouu cover limitations.\n\n53\n\n\t\n\nI\nI\n\nC.\t\n\nULTRAVIOLET RADIOMETERS\nUltraviolet radiometers are used to determine stratospheric ozone\n\nconcentrations. The BUVS sensor initially flown on NIMBUS and adapted for\nTIROS-N provides adequate data for most needs, and an improved version is\nnow in development. The present flight schedule for this series of sensors\nappears adequate for ice needs without specific emphasis.\nR\n\nC0.\t\n\nRADAR\nActive microwave sensors play an important role in the polar regions,\n\nwhere cloud formations are typical. The synthetic aperture radar (SAR),\nin particular, is probably the most important sensor for polar region\nri\n\n\t\n\nresearch. Its fine resolution images provide ice and snow dynamics from\ntime series data. Extent changes, melting rates, drift rates, deformation\nrates, ice patterns, ice leads, crevasses, and icebergs are all best\n\nS\t\n\ndetected and located with SAR. In addition, SAR oceai, images provide wave\nand current information and locate special feat"res like ships, oil spills,\netc. A second class o; important radar is the radar altimeter. This\nsensor has the potential for measuring ice/snow thickness and roughness\n1.\t\n\nfor sea ice, sheet ice, snow cover, and glaciers. The altimeter also can\nprovide supportive ocean data in terms of wave height spectra, tidal variations, and current structure. Radar scatterometers have recently bzen\ntested in the Arctic and have shown promise for measuring surface :roughness\nand ridging when used in conjunction with altimeters. Rain and pressure\nradars are also important in the polar regions, but are not peculiar in\ntheir needs relative to the designs for more general usage. Doppler and\n\nC\n-\t\nI \xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nswept frequency capability can be developed into almost any of the above\ndesigns, but more experimental data are needed to assess their utility\nfor the polar regions. Doppler measurements are normally good for sensitive motion measurements while the swept frequency method can conceptually\n\nl\n1\t\n\nproduce better measures of surface roughness and ice/snow thickness.

NOAA, NESS, tends to be more interested in\nglobal resolution than in regional or local resolution and does not appear\nto accept that the expense of processing such high resolution data is appropriate in their data processing budget. The Navy, in contrast, appears to\nwant the SAR in a more restricted satellite situation. This lack of a\ncivilian SAR to service ice, coastal, geological, and agricultural users\nis a serious gap in the civilian space program. A number of Arctic users\nwould be willing to pay for their own SAR system if they could obtain military approval. Much of the impetus from the international interests to be\ndiscussed later comes from industry backing (primarily oil companies). The\nvarious NOSS reports [e.g., Ref. 20] also proposed alternative SAR implementations with higher frequencies, wider swaths, coarser resolution multiple\nbeams for wide swath sampling, digital chirp, and nadir altimetry. The\nGSFC IPACS study proposed a wide swath implementation using electronically\nstepped beam shifting to allow wider swaths and much higher frequencies\n(see Table 13). Some kind of SAR is needed for ice, but it does not appear\nthat any systematic analyses or tests have been conducted to determine optimum frequencies for polar region uses. The 1.275- and 13-GHz bands proposed\nare the areas at which most existing experience is centered. Resolutions of\nff\nt\'\n\n100 m are adequate for most users, but international studies by Canada and\nESA have identified 20-m resolutions as a practical requirement. A number\nof users have a real requirement for resolution as low as 5 m. For polar\nregions, 100-km swaths are marginal, while 400- to 500-km swaths appear to\nbe more realistic in terms of operational needs. At 500-km swath and 100-m\n\nf\t\n\n1.\t\n\nresolution, the high data rate is still in the 20-Mbps range for four looks\nand 5-bit digitization. Real-time data processing capabilities are under\n\n.\t\n\ndevelopment, though, and if some of the weighted CCOs presently under\ndevelopment become feasible, then low cost processors may become practical.\nSeveral problems are associated with the use of radar altimeters in\nthe polar regions. If they are only to be used to measure ocean processes\n\n56\nP\nY\n\nlike wave heights, tidal variations, and current bulges, then the design\nproposed for NOSS (see Table 13) with a larger antenna is probably adequate.\nThis antenna size is still not large enough to make the signal beam-limited\nrather than pulse-limited, so the footprint is still variable between 1 and\n10 km for wave heights from flat to about 40 m. With the greater roughness\nand irregularity of ice, the effective footprint becomes even more variable\nand difficult to interpret. Larger antennas and higher frequencies are\nneeded to provide fine surface resolution, and for these systems the technology is costly at best. Microwave altimetry from satellites may thus offer\nlimited application to ice from satellites, but may be extremely cost\nefficient from airplanes.\nMicrowave altimeters are also used for ice and snow thickness mea:.irements. An L-band Apollo 17 radar was used to sound Greenland ice sheets,\nand S-band altimeters have been flown from aircraft in the Great Lakes and\nAlaska. Both give valid data in some freshwater ice or snow situations,\nbut do not operate well if significant layering or debris is present of if\nthe sea ice is new enough to be saline. Megahertz wavelengths appear to be\nless susceptible to these layering efforts and may provide an important\nimprovement. NOSS [Ref. 20] proposed an experimental option in the 20- to\n180-MHz range with perhaps two frequencies similar to the Apollo 17 experience. In addition, there is a megahertz sounder being developed to probe\ncometary ice, which may have application to this situation. Again a word\nof caution, though, in that lower frequencies imply larger footprints unless\nvery large antennas are provided. These turn out to be in the hundreds, of\nmeters range if beam-limited footprints of appropriate size are required.\nSynthetic aperture approaches alleviate some of this antenna size problem\nbut introduce other questions. Again, aircraft implementations or reliance\non laser altimetry may be more desirable.\nRadar scatterometers have recently been tested in Alaska and then backscatter coefficients appear to be related to ridging and other ice dynamics\nphenomena. More ice ridge dynamics studies are proposed. The NOSS scatterometer radar will be tested for these effects, but generally no systematic\n\n57\n\nI\nI\n\neffort has been undertaken to determine pseudo-optimum s wavelengths for ice\nscatterometry. A polar satellite, therefore, does not appear to need a\nscatterometer until basic research on ice/snow scatterometry is more complete.\n\nR\nC\nf\nf.\n\nAtmospheric radars that make precipitation, pressure, or doppler\nmeasurements (see Table 10) are under development for nonpolar uses. The\nprecipitation radar and pressure radar concepts were proposed in NOSS as\npossible use of experimental sensor capacity. GSFC and LeRC have activities on rain radar, and JPL and GSFC have activities on pressure radars.\nBoth developments are just entering the aircraft test stage, and early\ndemonstrations are needed. However, it may be premature to consider them\nfor a NOSS-type mission. The next environmental research mission with any\nreasonable orbit could be a good candidate for either or both sensors. The\ndoppler radar concept could be built into the precipitation radar without\nmajor effort. The swept frequency radar concept, or any radar with frequency\ndiversity, is popular at present, but little has been done with hardware,\nand limits on frequency allocations constrain feasibility. Although ice\nfrequency sweeping may provide a better measure of roughness, ice type,\n\nI\nand ice/snow porosity than normal scatterometry and radiometry, research\nis needed to validate these suppositions.\n\nE.\t\n\nLIDAR\nLIDAR has great potential for a wide variety of measurements, but\n\nit has not been tested thoroughly on present aircraft, and progress towards\nspace implementations is hindered by projections of bulky, power-hungry\nconfigurations with short useful lifetimes. In general, a good review of\nLIDAR systems for space and of present aircraft test experience was put\ntogether under the Shuttle LIDAR activity [Ref. 30].\nc\nFor specific ice measurements, the laser altimeter and laser scatterometer have very beneficial application. Spot sizes of 200 m appear\nr\nfeasible, which allows much better surface profiling than the best of the\n\ni\n\nc\n1 Pseudo-optimum refers to the fact that the available wavelengths are\nrestricted.\nc\n\n58\n\ni\n\n4\n\n\t\n\nl\n\nlarge-antenna microwave implemeotations. Scanning capability provides a\ngood chance for surface sl;;pe Medsurements plus a reasonable swath for\nsurface scatterometry. Laser scatterometric measurements could provide\nimproved determination of surface type and a measure of ice/snow/porosity.\nGSFC has proposed a combination laser altimeter and pulsed atmospheric\nLIDAR "Ref. 18] with a 2-km effective altimetry surface resolution and\nless than 10-cm vertical resolution. The frequency they have chosen\nat present is 0.532 um, but this could be flexible with further research.\n\nj\t\n\nThe laser scatterometric and doppler LIDAR functions could be accommodated\nwith this system. For the pulsed atmospheric LIDAR aspect of the system,\nthe effective surface resolution proposed is 300 m, and the effective swath\n\nwith beam scanning is 900 km. This is an experimental concept and not\nmuch detail is presently available for this system. It appears to be a\n\n^i!\t\n\nnatural evolution of the concepts proposed for the Shuttle LIDAR [ Ref. 301.\nPower requirements of 750 to 1500 W on board the spacecraft are anticipated.\nThe surface composition LIDAR is of interest to fishing and pollution\ncontrol activities, but is not unique to polar regions. Although aircraft\n\nLtests have shown good sensitivities, the power required is in excess of that\nproposed for the pulsed atmospheric LIDAR. This system is probably immature\nEll\t\n\nright now, but development will proceed with or without polar user pressures.\n\nI\'\t\n\nThe continuous wave (CW) atmospheric LIDAR has been shown to have\nparticularly sensitive capability for detecting trace constituents in the\n\nl(\t\n\nstratosphere and can be implemented with powers on the order of watts or\ntens of watts per pair of spectral lines utilized. The sensor is under\n\n[\t\n\ndevelopment by NASA for Shuttle demonstration, but similarly will proceed\n\nwithout polar user pressures. CW and pulsed lasers for atmospheric composition measurements are also under extensive development by the military.\n\nr\nr,\n59\n\nr\n\n\t\n\nVI. TRAJECTORY TRADEOFFS\n\nT.\t\n\nThere are a number of orbit options that make sense in the polar regions.\nMr. Johnie Driver at JPL has made an excellent study of most of these alternatives. Many of the displays in this section are from his study. In\nattempting to optimize ice coverage patterns, there are several conflicting\nneeds. Some polar environmental information users need broad coverage with\nthe most rapid total fill-in possible, consistent with the scale of the change\nprocess being monitored. Other users benefit from rapid repeat in a single\nlocation over consecutive passes to monitar specific events like sea ice edge\nmotions, sea ice thickness variations, lead patterns, etc. Initially, their\ninformation needs could be satisfied by special orbits with rapid repeat for\nseveral days followed by a large time gap before the next repeat cycle.\nThe best satelliteround track for providing 9\t rapid total coverage of\nP\t\nP\t\n9\t\n9\nthe polar regions appears to be in the orbits between 84 to 87 deg in\ninclination. These orbits provide coverage of the pole, assuming the\nouter limit of the side-looking radar image with swaths between 100 and\n\nI\t\n\n400 km wide. The 87-deg orbit provides almost parallel patterning in a\nlongitudinal sense (see Figure 3a) compared to the crossing patterns of\nthe lower inclination or sun-synchronous orbit (e.g., F igure 3b). The\nwide swath sensors in the 87-deg orbit give the efficient fill-in pattern\nshown in Figure 4a, with rapid synoptic coverage of about 50-deg latitude\n\nt\t\nand considerable repeat coverage very near the pole. The narrow swath\nsensors like the SEASAT imaging radar provide a wheel-spoke effect (see\nFigure 4b), with a wide variety of options as to whether consecutive passes\nf\'\t\n\nhave just-touching swaths at some prechosen latitude or whether a more\ncomplex fill-in is desired. The lower inclination or sun-synchronous\norbits Provide considerably different patterns for narrow swath sensors\n\n1.\t\n\n(illustrated in Figure 4c), where an "ice-hole" is left unimaged at the pole,\nbut considerable densification of coverage takes place at some lower latitude.\n\nr\n`\t\n\n60\n\ntr\n\n\t\nA. 87 0 INCLINATION\n\nB.

SWATH WIDTH EFFECTS ON POLAR COVERAGE\n\n61\n\nThe two major coverage alternatives have some contrasting advantages\nthat merit further study. In Figure 5, a comparison is made for wide swath\ncoverage between 87- and 69-deg inclination orbits. In the 87-deg orbit,\nthe highest density of coverage is above 75-deg latitude. At latitudes\naround the north slope of Alaska, any ground site is covered once or twice\nconsecutively at one time of day; this sweep is repeated once or twice\n12 hours later when the satellite is coming around the other way. In the\n69-deg orbit, a similar ground site in Alaska is seen on three to five\nconsecutive orbits, but is then not seen again until the next day. This\nincrease in consecutive coverage has some advantage for some kinds of navigation support and for some kinds of research.\nFor narrow swath sensors, some further optimization can be accomplished\nr\'\t\n\nby investigating what inclination provides the best densification for some\nparticular area of interest. Figure 6 shows some gross variation in an\nattempt to find the best densification in the region just above the north\nslope of Alaska. Something about 70 deg looks appropriate. By varying\nthis swath, as shown in Figure 7, it can be seen that a swath around 400 km\nwide provides a good coverage for the navigation support proposed. A 400-\n\n1\t\n\nto 500-km swath appears to also be the maximum swath practical in the present\nstate of the art for a synthetic aperture radar imager with 100-m resolution.\nIt is interesting to note that this high coverage density orbit for the\n1\t\n\nnort;, slope is at approximately the same inclination as the coastal processes\norbit that best follows (in a compromise sense) the eastern and western U.S.\ncoastlines. Payloads for polar and coastal missions are also quite similar\nin that they are generally not interested in a finer areal resolution scale,\n\nf\t\n\nbut more localized coverage than that addressed by NOSS and System 85 (where\n\nl\t\n\nthe main customers are concerned primarily with global ocean and weather\nprocesses).\nIn order to provide some insight into other p rospects, Mr. Driver\nhas looked at several other kinds of swathing and other orbital types. A\nmultibeam SAR swathing pattern is shown in Figure 8. In this concept 15\nseparate 10-km swaths are produced, separated by 100 km each. Each beam is\n\nf\n\ntreated as a SAR and samples the wide swath coverage, allowing improved\n\n62\n\n\t\n\nH = 870 km, INC -- 87 deg\n\nH = 847 k-n, INC - 69 deg\n\n^^^ I I -A -yam,\n\n-A\nrn\nw\n\nB\n\n\ti\t\nI\n\nLATITUDE 50 TO 90\nFIGURE 5.

It also provides a\nbetter coverage for fishing and pollution control activities since it is\nmore difficult for ships to avoid this pattern than for any of the slow\nfill-in options. On the other hand, it makes some types of research more\ndifficult and certainly complicates processing and interpretation.\nFor continuous monitoring, geostationary orbits are often desirable.\nEquator-located geostationary orbits do not provide good coverage at latitudes above 50 or 60 deg. Providing inclination at geostationary orbits\ncreates a figure-8 orbit that can loop along the southern Alaskan coast\nup along Juneau and back down the Aleutians or can be made to peak along\nthe north slope. Because these orbits provide only once-a-day coverage\nper satellite rather than the continuous coverage desired, their value\nis questionable. A brief look was also taken at a "Polesitter," which\nuses solar electric or nuclear electric propulsion to hold a spacecraft\nover the pole against the earth/moon gravity field and in an unstable\norbit passing in and out of the earth\'s orbit while holding above the\nplane of the ecliptic [see Ref. 29]. Mr. Driver found that, though the\nconcept is feasible, the equilibrium altitude, using today\'s electric\npropulsion technology and near-term projections of it, are several lunar\ndistances away from the earth. This was not considered practical for\ntoday\'s needs.\nThis leaves us with three major orbits of interest to polar monitoring.\nThe sun-synchronous orbit is still necessary for those sensors requiring\nfixed sun angles. These sensors are generally identical with sensors of\nequal or greater interest for application in temperate and tropical areas.\nPolar region interes s could, thus, utilize this capability without separate developments. The 84- to 87-deg and 67- to 70-deg inclination orbits\nare both still possibilities depending on the interests of other nonsolar\ndisciplines in these orbits. introduction of an 84- to 87-deg orbit\nmission is presently being considered for next year\'s budget. A decision\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nas to whether NOSS should be used to obtain a greater portion of these\n\nT\t\n\npolar requirements or whether separate research satellites shoulu oe\ndeveloped for new sensor demonstrations at either 84- to 87-deg or\n\n67\n\n67- to 70-deg inclinations will need further study by a user group representing each of the research and industry factions with interest in the\npolar regions.\n\n68\n\nVII. DATA PROCESSING AND DELIVERY ALTERNATIVES\n\nMost of the economic benefit and social service benefit in the polar\nregions come from the near-real-time r availability of environmental information. Thus, it is important to both deliver measurements in near real\ntime and to convert the measurements into environmental information within\nthat same time span. Some of the alternative data/information delivery\nsystems that furnish near-real-time polar environmental information are\nshown in Figure 9. The same system options are typical for other regional\nneeds also.\nOptions 1 and 2 assume that all information is channeled through a\ncentral processing site where all or a major portion of the processing is\ndone. O p tions 3, 4, and 5 are dispersed processing options; i.e., it is\nassumed that processing is done on the platform by the real-time user or\nat a number of regional processing and redissemination centers or by some\ncombination of these processing options as determined by economic efficiency.\n\nA.\t\n\nCENTRALIZED OPTIONS\nOption 1 in Figure 9 is quite similar to the expected data/information\n\ndelivery system proposed in the early 19805 for both NOSS [Ref. 20] and TiRC:-0.\nThe system operation is as follows: data from the measurement platform. are\ntransferred in real time through the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite (TDRS)\nto \'White Sands, where NOAA and, in the case of NOSS, the Navy have a data preprocessing facility. The preprocessed data are then passed on to a central\ninformation processing facility through a commercial domestic satellite\n(DOMSAT) link. Probable information processing facilities ar\xc2\xb0 the National\n\n! Near real time is generally considered to be a time span of less than\n3 hours, maximum, but there are some users wno require the information\nin less than 1 hour.\n69\n\n.^^ - . _..: 7l y}.^ M.\xe2\x80\xa2^!\'^t!+gl" ^^^\t\n\n_\t\n\nO\n\nPOLAR\n\nSATELLITE\n\n0\n\nI\t\n\nr\t\n\nO\n\nFIGURE 9.

The central facility for ice data\nprocessing would probably be the joint Navy/NOAA Ice Survey Office located\nin Suitland, Maryland. From there, the data are sent directly to users or\nto regional centers for further processing. Option 2 is similar to Option 1\n^.\t\n\nexcept that White Sands is bypassed and a new-generation TDRS allows\n\nj ,\ttransfer directly to the central processing site or sites. Option 2 is\nnot presently planned, but has potential cost savings.\nIn these centralized processing options, it is still possible to place\n\npart of the processing burden at the satellite, part at the central site,\npart at the regional dissemination centers, and part at the real-time user\nfacilities. As far as most users are concerned, the system could be relatively transparent; i.e., they could be getting data or information in\nless than 1 to 3 fours without knowing the complexity of the communications\n\nchannels between them and the measurement platform.\n\nE\n\nThe major advantage of a centralized system is that access to the data\ncan be easily controlled and, in fact, doctored, if it is in the nationai\n\nE\n\ninterest that military operations be protected. It is also conceptually\none of the least costly options to the total economy, since processing is\n\ndone centrally and duplication is minimized. Practically, it has some\nproblems that relate to real-time polar navigation and operations scheduling.\nReal time in this case is less than 1 hour and some feel this would be\n\nimpractical to implement in a centralized processing system. Also, because\n(\t\n\nit is so central, its cost of operation is extremely visible, and since it\nis conceptually set up to be the most efficient system to do everything,\n\nf\n\nit is also a single and visible large cost item rather than dispersed as\na b , idget item amongst many different organizations. The centralized\nprocessing concept cannot deal with all of the formats each of the users\nrequire. Therefore, in the past, these central agencies have tended to\n\nC\n\nmake the data or information available only when the data has been processed beyond the point where the user community diverges in opinion as\nto how the processing should be done. If many of the new concepts NCAA\n\n71\n\nr\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2^-r- - .. - - - -\n\n\t\n\nr\n\n1\n\nand the Navy have proposed for NOSS are funded, then some of these types\nof problems with centralized systems could be alleviated.\n\ne\nr\n\nB.\t\n\nDISPERSED OPTIONS\nOption 3 in Figure 9 assumes that much of the data processi.)c is done\n\nin real time on board the measurement platform so that the preseriz environmental information can be sent in real time to users as the platform passes\nover user facilities. Few of the real-time users are interested in information outside the view of satellite platforms as they pass within line of\nsight of the user location (normally a circle with a radius of about 2000 km).\nUsers re q uiring more precision in the processing or the integration of other\ndata not available from the satellite or forecast information would have to\nu\t\n\nget data from one of the centralized options.\n\nOption 4 is like Option 3 except that it is assumed that data from any\nlocation can be sent to any user in real time through a new generation of\nrTDRS. Option 5 assumes that all data of interest to any regional users is\nl\n\nautomatically sent to regional sites directly from the data relay satellite.\nSuch data can be easily coded so that while all data is sent to the regional\ncenter, only that which is needed is accepted for storage and processing.\nThe major advantage of the dispersed processing options is that it\n\nlforces the user community to accept a larger portion of the processing\ncosts. If the institutional agencies, whether research oriented like NASA\nfor operational oriented like NOAA, design their systems for maximum inheritability by the user, then the user can add special features at low enough\ncost so that he can afford to do most of the processing himself or through\nconsortiums of people with similar needs (referred to in this report as\nregional centers).\n.\t\n\nFor a polar satellite, the dispersed option is of particular interest.\nThe oil and gas industry could set up regional processing sites in Northern\nAlaska, Northern Canada, Newfoundland, Iceland, and Norway. Arctic shipping\ncould use the same sites and additional sites established in the Antarctic.\n\nF72\n\nr.\n\nPolar fisheries could have similar stations, but in the Aleutians, in Nova\nScotia, and in Antarctica. Polar research stations for a wide variety of\nT\ndisciplines could also be established at Alaskan universities, on Greenland,\non Antarctica, or at other appropriate locations. These research sites\nI\n\nwould collect data for weather or climate or for polar ocean currents with\nlater redissemination in the form of forecasts. Many regional centers in\nthe meteorological sector, like the National Weather Service Redwood City\nfacility in California, already put their own torque on products forwarded\nfrom the central forecasting facility in Maryland.\nThe key advantage of the centralized options is control; the key\nadvantage of the dispersed options is a natural forcing of a greater\nportion of the cost of processing on the user rather than on the operational agency. Conceptually, both systems could be made to look identical\nto the user; in practice, it is difficult, given national budget constraints,\nfor the cer*ralized options to provide broad service. Further discussion\non the decentralized options can be found in Reference 31.\n\n73\n\n1\'.\n\n\t\n\nI\nVIII.\t\n\nPL AT F O RM (PA YL O AD) AL T E RNATIV E S\n(PA LO D)\nL T 0,\t\n\nSeveral key q\t uestions are reexamined briefly in this section. Are\ny q\ny\nthere urique ice coverage orbits? Are sensor requirements for the polar\nregion significantly different from those for atmospheric, ocean, and land\nmeasurements? Is there a separate role for a dedicated aircraft or an\nF\t\n\nin situ measurement program? A summary of the sensor and orbital coverage\nevaluations is provided in Table 14.\n\nn\t\n\nA.\t\n\nSATELLITES\n\nBased onhP sics considerations there are four kinds of easi l y iden\t\ny\t^\ny\n(j\t\n\ntifiable low earth orbits from which a satellite can practically provide\n\nL\t\n\nunique measurement data capabilities for polar research and operations.\nThe weather orbit of the TIROS or DMSP type satellite is sun synchronous,\nhas 3:30 and 7:30 equator crossings, and helps separate out diurna l, and\nseasonal effects. As shown in Table 14, the payload of importance is similar\n\n[\t\n\nto present System 85 and Block 6 designs and probably does not have to be\nadjusted significantly for polar needs. At most, the atmospheric soundersl\nand thermal/cloud mappers l would require only the addition of one or two\nfrequencies to better quantify surface temperatures on ice and snow.\n\n^-\t\n\nThe near-noon orbit of LANDSAT and NIMBUS-G maximizes the reflected\nsolar energy to the sensor. At an 11:30 equator crossing, this orbit\nwould also provide the final 4-hour step in sun-synchronous equator crossings\nfor operational weather inputs. Generally, due to the pervasiveness of\ncloud cover in the polar regions, the visible-and-infrared surface-feature\n\n^ i\tand surface-composition mappers have limited application, and it is probably\n\n\'Visible, infrared, and microwave combined.\nC.\t\nl:\n\n74\n\np\n\nm\n\n!"\'1\n\n!"\n\ng\n\n"`1\n\n-. -i\n\n"\'\'7\n\t\n\nl\nV\nI\n\nTABLE 14\nSELECTING PAYLOADS FOR POLAR MISSIONS\n\nA. runt.\n\nlili..rlolel Al\xe2\x80\x94plrerla (u.pl)l:lun W \xe2\x80\xa2 qw\t\nY \xe2\x80\xa2 )Ib le { 1.11\xe2\x80\x94ed\t\n\nk.d11111\xe2\x80\x94 Y.dyet Nltper \t\n,\nA:^l , ~,, S\xe2\x80\x94Wer\t\nA1.1pAtrl.

It would,\nhowever, be useful to add the surface-composition mapper to the future\nLANDSAT platforms. The other sensors are weather and atmosphere oriented\nand provide the final inputs into the operational sun-s y nchronous constellation.\nThe polar orbit of the early NOSS type was chosen to ensure full polar\ncoverage. At 87 deg, the SAR outer swath for a SEASAT-like implementation\n\nr.\n\njust touch_ts one pole, but misses the other unless it is made to look out\n\nthe other side after it passes the equator. If the SAR is not flown, as\npresent NOSS thinking goes, then the 84-deg orbit will still cover the\n\npole with wide swath sensors and provide better diurnal variation. The\nNOSS would carry an upgraded thermal/cloud mapper, a surface composition\n\n^r\n\nmapper, a microwave radiometer, radar altimeter, and radar scatterometer\nplus an allowance for 25-percent extra support service capability for use\nw i th experimental sensors. The synthetic aperture radar, a precipitation/\ndoppler radar, a pressure radar, and a new-generation atmospheric sounder\n\n!C\n\nhave all been considered as part of the experimental portion of the payload\n[Ref. 201. Based on the GS i\': C study [Ref. 18], an experimental LIDAR exper-\n\niment might also be appropriate. In Table 14, the surface composition\nmapper was not included in the recommended payload because in an optimization sense it better fits the near-noon sun-synchronous orbit. The atmospheric composition mapper could similarly benefit from the near-noon\n\nsun-synchronous orbit and has already been flown in this orbit.\nThe 65- to 75-deg orbit was chosen to provide additional density of\n\ncoverage in the Alaskan latitudes and relatively more rapid diurnal change\nin consecutive passes. It also happens to provide a good compromise orbit\nfor relatively efficient coverage of the U.S. 200-mile limit on all coastlines. This relatively experimental trajectory would then carry the full\n\nL\t\n\ncomplement of sensors with reasonable development history (see later columns\nI:\t\n\nof Table 14).\t\n\nIt is important to note that additional new frequencies\n\narid/or additional new sensitivity or areal resolution are required in\nnearly all of the sensors (whatever their orbit) if a more optimum polar\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\n^.\n\nr^\n\nviewing ib to be achieved.\n\n76\n\n\t\n\nI\n\nI\n\nIn the next set of columns in Table 14, the JPL, GSFC, and LeRC\nrecommendations for polar trajectory missions are provided for comparison.\nThe JPL version is NOSS oriented; the GSFC effort adds additional climateoriented atmospheric sensors not being considered by NOAA in the System 85\neffort; and LeRL, although not specifically recommending a payload, has\nemphasized study of the four sensors designated in all of the ice research\nand development planning [Ref. 271.\nIn general, all of these payload options are technically feasible,\nbut selection of a particular payload for implementation is beyond the\nscope of this effort. Instead, we have delineated the array of options\nfeasible for consideration by a user group supporting the assessment of\nnew-start options.\n\nl\n^ j\n\nr\t\n\nB.\t\n\nAIRiRAFT\n\n1.\nTable 14 shoes a sample payload for a dedicated polar airplane. It is\nproposed, by grouping several measurement functions into one aircraft sensor\nand eliminating stratospheric sensors, a set containing 10 sensors can be\ngenerated which would provide an extremely effective airplane payload. This\nI .\t\n\nairplane would be particularly suitable for demonstrating new concepts, for\nvalidating measurement capability, for supporting scientific research, and\n\n^.\t\n\nfor providing short-term increased local densif;cation of coverage for\nspecific operational needs.\n\n^.\t\n\nThere is a need for NASA to use its high-technology capability to\ndevelop an airplane-payload prototy p e. Hardware and software components\n\nI .\t\n\ncould then be purchased from specifications by operational agency or\nindustry interests to provide focused support for individual needs. Like\n\n.\t\nI\n\nthe Great Lakes, the north slope of Alaska or the International Ice Patrol\nregion are relatively limited areas compared to the synoptic scales of\n\n^.\t\n\nsatellite coverage. it is our opinion that a case could be made to show\nthat, if an aircraft prototype were specifically designed to hold a coordinated polar payload, use of this aircraft might produce much of the added\nice region support needed by industry and the operational agencies without\n\n1\t\n\n77\n\nadversely impacting present planning for other satellite systems. This\nhigh-technology prototype development job seems ideally suited to the\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration rather than to each of the\noperational agencies and industries, with their highly overlapping needs\nand, for the most part, relatively lower-technology experience.\n\nC.\t\n\nIN SITU ENVIRONMENTAL TESTING\nPolar-oriented in situ environmental sensing packages have not received\n\nthe same depth of consideration as the remote sensing payloads. Because\nof this, the ground truth used to calibrate remote sensors is often less\naccurate than the remote sensor sensitivity, and comparative capabilities\nassessments often show superiority in the remote sensing system. There\ndoes not appear to be an agency with the responsibility or the budget to\nexplore better high technology for in situ environmental measurement packages\nfor polar or other regions. NASA programs would benefit if NASA took a lead\nin this area.\nIr. addition, there are a number of polar environmental parameters in\nTable 10 that either do not have techniques identified for remote measurement or do not have a sensor identified with enough laboratory and field\nexperience to validate utility for a spaceborne implementation. A network\nof in situ sensing packages with inexpensive relay link terminals for data\ncollection via satellite could satisfy many of the identified needs. Again,\nthis option has not been extensively evaluated.\n\n78\n\n1\n\nt\nIX.\t\n\nS;.:\'PLE IMPLEMENTATION ALTERNATIVES FOR POLAR RESEARCH\n\nA number of different platforms could be used to carry polar research\npayloads.\t\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nSeveral\t platform options have been studied to various degrees of\n\ndepth at JPL, GSFC, and LeRC. \t\n\nAdding our own assessment, we have rearranged\n\ntheir efforts\t into the following five illustrative categories:\nC\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nMinor modifications to NOSS and TIROS-0\n\n0\t\n\nNOSS-based satellite with optimized payload\n\n^.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nNew NASA satellite with foreign participation\n\n_\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nNew\t international\t satellite with U.S.\t participation\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nAircraft and\t in situ supplement to existing satellites.\n\nEach of these alternatives \t has distinctive characteristics Ind a\npotential\t\n\ndiffering\n\nimpact on service projec}ed\t (see Figure 10)\t and funding required.\n\nA brief description of each alterr3tive and a preliminary a^.sessment\n\nof\n\nIits advantages are described\t in the following sections.\n\nA.\t\n\nMINOR MODIFICATIONS TO NOSS AND TIROS-9/DMSP-BLOCK- 6\nIn this alternative (Option 1 in Figure 10), experimental sensor devel-\n\nopments are separated from sensors considered ready for operational deployment. Thus, the major NOSS and TIROS-0/DMSP-Block-6 payloads are considered\nt\t\n\nfixed relative to sensor types and surface resolutions, but may be adjustable\nin terms of spectral band selection without major cost impact. All the more\nexperimental concepts like pressure radar, rain radar, doppler radar, megahertz and laser altimeters, atmospheric sounding, surface composition LIDAR,\nand so on, are relegated to demonstration on separate research systems,\neither free flier or Shuttle based, or by inclusion in the 25 percent\novercapacity presently designed O nto the NOSS and TIROS-0 systems through\na NOAA decision.\n79\n\n\t\n\nR \'\nE^\n\nr\n\nA\nf\n\tLSEASAT\t\n\nf\nL\n\nTIROS\n\n0\t\n\nSTATUS QUO\n\nn\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 AIRCRAFT SUPPLEMENT?\n\nNOSS\t\n\n(YSTEM 85)\t\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 In situ SUPPLEMENT?\n\nMINOR MODIFICATIONS\t\n\nL\n\n1\n\nLNSS +\t\n\nTIROS-O+\t\n\nr\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 ADDED ICE FREQUENCIES\n\xe2\x80\xa2 SAR ADDED\n\xe2\x80\xa2 EXPERIMENTAL ICE SENSORS\n\nMOSS\xe2\x80\x94BASED SATELLITE\n\xe2\x80\xa2 PAYLOAD OPTIMIZED FOR ICE\n2\t\n\nICESAT\t\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 SAR (25. 100 m)\n\xe2\x80\xa2 EXPERIMENTAL ICE SENSORS\n\xe2\x80\xa2 SCIENCE AND INDUSTRY ORIENTED\n\n^I\n\nNEW RESEARCH SATELLITE\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 PAYLOAD OPTIMIZED FOR POLAR RESEARCH\n\n^I\n\n3\t\n\nCRYOSAT\t\n\n0 SAR ( 100 m)\n\xe2\x80\xa2 SCIENCE ORIENTED\n\xe2\x80\xa2 MAJOR FC,REIGN PARTICIPATION\n\nNEW INTERNATIONAL SATELLITE\n\xe2\x80\xa2 PAYLOAD OPTIMIZED FOR POLAR SERVICES\n\nAND RESEARCH\n4\t\n\nI\n\nPOLARSAT\t\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 SAR (20 m)\n\xe2\x80\xa2 INDUSTRY AND SCIENCE ORIENTED\n\xe2\x80\xa2 INTERNATIONAL MANAGEMENT,\nU.S. PARTICIPATION\n\nF;GURE 10.

Although lower fregrency choices for the altimeter (e.g.,\nS- or L-band) might give some advantage in terms of indicating the presence\nof thin ice, tests show that exact thicknesses are probably not derivable\n\nfrom these channels. Megahertz altimetry, rain and doppler radar, pressure\nCradar, laser altimetry, atmospheric LIDAR, and surface composition LIDAR;\nwhich were suggested for possible inclusion earlier, would all be relegated\nto candidacy for the 25-percent extra payload capacity presently allowed\nin the satellite designs. Fcr polar regions, the synthetic aperture radar\ni\t\n\nfrom SEASAT would have extremEly high priority fo r uciiizin,, the extra\ncapacity on NOSS. It has beet \xe2\x96\xba q va liUdLed by JPL [Ref. 20] for inclusion,\nbut was dropped from the NCSS pa y load at the suggestion of both `10AA and\nthe Navy. It was thought to ho too expensive a data processing job `or\nNOAA budgets, not significantly important to global weather modelers, and\nredundant to classified surveillance systems presently in the budget for\nimplementation. All three of these assertions appear easi ly challengeable,\n\nbut are not addressed here.\nIn summary, NOSS could easily be modified to be more responsive to\npolar region needs. What is needed in addition, however, is demonstra-\n\ntion of all the new radar and laser/LIDAR -echniques that cold provide\n^.\t\n\nextremely critical parameters for polar research and polar environmental\nforecasting. Most of these sensors are not far enough along to be considered\nin the present NOSS program, even as part of the 25-percent experimental\npayload, but projec;,ed benefits from these sensors indicate that some\ndevelopment activity is warranted.\n\nI\n\nt\n83\n\nB.\t\n\nNOSS-BASED SATELLITE WITH OPTIMIZED PAYLOAD\nA related option to the first alternative would be to leave the basic\n\nNOSS design alone, but design a polar-region-optimized payload for inclusion\non the spare NOSS spacecraft, or on a fourth NOSS spacecraft purchased early\nenough to take advantage of the cost savings in multiple buys (Option 2 in\nFigure 10). The spare would be utilized if the first two NOSS are successfully injected into orbit and their performance verified. The polar-regionmodified NOSS payload suggested in Table 15, including the synthetic aperture\nradar, would be supplemented by a rain/doppler/pressure radar experimental\nsensor and an atmospheric/altimetric LIDAR experimental sensor (see Table 16).\nThe surface composition LIDAR is also of interest, but its more extreme power\nrequirements warrant leaving it to the Shuttle radar demonstration. The\nexperimental radar concepts were considered by JPL in early NOSS designs\nfRef. 20], and the experimental LIDAR was considered by GSFC [Ref. 181.\nInclusion of both may exceed projected growth capability in the present\nNOSS spacecraft design, but this needs more in-depth consideration before\nsuch a conclusion can be made.\nThe advantages of this alternative are that (1) the NOSS operational\nconcept is not disrupted, (2) use of the spare NOSS spacecraft or a relatively inexpensive extra spacecraft keeps costs down, (3) all the highly\nimportant parameters only addressed by the experimental radar ?nd LIDAR\nsensors could be investigated, (4) the polar science and operational users\nwould have a focus in their own system, and (5) the data system could be\n!.\t\n}\xe2\x80\xa2-\t\n\ntailored for service to polar users.\nThe disadvantages of this alternative are that (1) it entails system\n\ni.\t\n\nproliferation, (2) some of the changes needed are the same as those needed\n\n1\t\n\nby coastal and other more temperate or tropical users, and (3) the U.S.\n\npolar regicn interests are relatively small compared to international\ninterests. On the other hand, there appears to be enough profit involved\nfor the U.S. oil companies in the polar region that they might be willing\nto launch their own imaging radar satellite, just to aid navigation above\nthe north slope, if they could get the government to allow them to make\nsuch a launch.

The\nnon-real-time, selected-for-interesting-event processing choices of the\nscientific mission can thus be consumed by an operational number-crunching\nproblem.\nThis alternative attempts to avoid this problem by setting up a\nseparate research satellite that works in conjunction with cperational\n\ni\t\n\nsystemZ. in terms of data sharing, but which is not committed to extensive\no p Pra.f,ional data processing. On the other hand, this is not just a testbed\nfor selected NASA sensor developments, but is designed as a real coordinated\nscientific mission to explore regional or local p ;,blems comprehensively.\nThus, it may duplicate some sensors on operational s y stems when this duplication aids interpretation. This approach is not unique to polar region\ninterests and is embodied, in part, in the Platforms for Applications\nResearch (PAR) concept presently being proposed by GSFC.\nThe disadvantages of this concept are that it does require fully new\ndesign (though use of the Multimission Modular Spacecraft [MMS] or other\nexisting designs reduce these cost implications some) and that it is an\nambitious mission in terms of funding requirements for one not claiming to\nprovide the interested industry or government agency operations with any\nprojected benefits. Thus, it could potentially (thougF it need not) split\n\nr\t\nJ\xe2\x80\xa2\t\n\nthe user community into opposing factions, weakening the funding position\nof both the operational and research systems.\n\nD.\t\n\nNEW INTERNATIONAL SATELLITES WITH U.S. PARTICIPATION\nBoth Canada and ESA have performed studies of polar satellite missions\n\n[Refs. 22 and 231. Both have expressed interest in joint fundin g , and some\ninitial informal meetings have taken place between Canada and the U.S. and\nCanada and ESA. Canada has been seeking more formal commitments through\nofficial channels, but in a low-key fashion. The Canadian and ESA interest\n\nT\n\n87\n\nis not surprising, since they have considerably more blocs of the polar\n\na\nz\nt\n\nregion under their influence than does the U.S. Both governments are also\nresponsive to Arctic oil-industry interests. For both Canada and ESA, the\nSAR is the sensor of greatest importance for polar environmental service\n\nmissions, and how many other sensors are added is just a matter of funding\navailability and the acceptability of proposals.\nThis alternative (Option 4 of Figure 10) has some interesting implications for the U.S. The oil interests in Canada and Europe are sufficiently\npowerful, due to the extreme inadequacy of supply, that Canada and\n\nF1\nr\n\nESA will\n\nprobably go forward with at least a "SARSAT" or "SURSAT" mission, J th or\nwithout the participation of the U.S. This 20-m resolution imaging radar\nwould then be available to their economic (and military) unit\'s and perhaps\nnot to ours. The U.S. could join them now and work towards implementing a\nmore dynamic capability than that presently available through individual\n\nG\n\nefforts. Once the decision for joint activity is made, the next question\n\na\n\nleadership dominates, then alternative 3 is most appropriate for it includes\n\nis the magnitude of the U.S. participation. If the need to retain U.S.\n\ninternational participation in a basically U.S. mission. \t\n\nIn the polar regions,\n\ndue to the fact that the U.S. has less area, less industry investment, and\n\nr\n\nless population than the Canadian and ESA interests, it may be appropriate\nto let Canada or ESA take the lead in polar space activities, with the U.S.\nonly providing a sensor or two, some data p rocessing, and perhaps portions\nof the spacecraft. Launching satEl\'iites using the French launch systems\n\nr\n\nmight even be more economical in this situation. Under this concept, the\n\nc\n\nbuted according to international need.\n\nU.S. gets the same polar services for much less cost and costs are distri-\n\nIV\nr\t\n\nE.\t\n\nAIRCRAFT AND IN SITU SUPPLEMENT TO EXISTING SATELLITES\nFor the U.S.,\t the major polar interests are\t in Alaska\t and\t in\t the\n\nLabrador Current area for the\t International\t\n\nIce Patrol\n\nServices.\t\n\nBecause\n\neach of these regions are relatively\t limited\t in the areas actually requiring\nmonitoring,\t an aircraft implementation may be more cost effective than a\ndedicated\t satellite.\n\nPreliminary aircraft\t tradeoff studies\t for the coastal\n\n88\n\n^r\n\nregions by LeRC [Ref. 32 and Battelle [\tRef. 33 ^\t expose the viability of\n9\t^\n\t\nP\t\nY\nsuch a concept when limited areas are involved.\nAs shown in Table 14, a constellation of about 10 sensors on a single\nairplane could provide a near complete environmental monitoring payload\nfor polar regions. Less than 12 planes, even with 1 out of 3 always in\n\xe2\x80\xa2-\t\n\nrepair could probably cover either area given reasonably high-altitude\ncapability and payloads utilizing the full array of sensors of interest\n(interpolated from Ref. 33). The Coast Guard has requested the budget to\nbuy airplanes of this same general type to patrol much of the coastal ocean\narea in the U.S. 200-mile limit.\t\n\nIt would be up to NASA to design and\n\ndemonstrate a prototype payload and data analysis system for Coast Guard\noperational use. Past comparisons have generally put most sensors on\ndifferent airplanes and have considered much larger areas for coverage.\nSatellites have seemed aood alternative in these comparisons. In this\n9\t\nP\ncase, the area is much more limited and suitable airplanes will also be\navailable and will be working the polar regions in question. A stronger\nlook needs to be taken at just what could be accomplished by this airplane\nalternative, the cost involved, and how this would affect satellite payload\ndecisions.\nA network of in situ polar sensor packages with relay data links to\nthe central or regional processing centers might also be a practical supplement to existing satellite p l anning, with or without dedicated airplane\npayload3. Whether Option 0 in Figure 10 would be best as truly status quo\nor should be status quo only in the satellite rather than in the aircraft\nand in situ portions needs study.\n\nr\n\n1\n\n89\n\n\t\n\nJ\nR\nF.\nr\n\nLIST OF REFERENCES\n\nSEASAT Economic Assessment, Volumes I through X, Econ, Inc., Report\n75-125-16, August 31, 1975 (NASA Contract No. NASW-2558).\nR.
