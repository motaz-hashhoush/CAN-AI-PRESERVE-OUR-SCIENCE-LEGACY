The efforts are presently focused on the verification of the stability of the X-band uplink and other RF and microwave subsystems which contribute to the overall stability of the system. The measurement methodology is presented as well as frequency stability data generated with the development measurement system. The system characteristics are highlighted and the potential areas where improvements could be made are discussed.", "title": "Station stability measurement", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-11T02:07:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19810015469, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Sosa, E.
