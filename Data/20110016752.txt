Glenn Research Center, Cleveland, Ohio\nA plasma accelerator has been conceived for both material-processing and\nspacecraft-propulsion applications. This\naccelerator generates and accelerates ions\nwithin a very small volume. Because of its\ncompactness, this accelerator could be\nnearly ideal for primary or station-keeping propulsion for spacecraft having\nmasses between 1 and 20 kg. Because this\naccelerator is designed to generate beams\nof ions having energies between 50 and\n200 eV, it could also be used for surface\nmodification or activation of thin films.\n\n24\n\nThe figure illustrates selected aspects\nof this accelerator. A propellant gas is injected through a feed plenum that is\nperforated with openings that constitute\ncapillarylike channels in the following\nsense: They are narrow enough that\neven at low flow rates, the pressure in\nthem is sufficiently high [a few Torr (a\nfew hundred pascals)] that the depth of\nchannels (the thickness of the plenum\nwall) is of the order of electron/neutralatom mean free path. The plenum,\nwhich is at anode potential, is centered\n\nabove a magnetic cusp generated by a\npermanent-magnet circuit that consists\nof ring of magnets surrounding a central\nmagnet.\nThe magnetic cusp funnels energetic\nelectrons into the plenum openings.\nThese electrons ionize the propellant gas\nin the channels. Hence, each plenum orifice serves as a very compact, independent\ndischarge cell that provides copious\namounts of ions that are subsequently accelerated by sheath potentials.

The device is symmetrical about the z axis.\n\npartly on the basis of the depth of the\nchannels, is of the order of 0.05 mm3.\nThe source of electrons is an annular\nhot filament. This source is located such\nthat emitted electrons must diffuse across\nthe magnetic field to reach the anode.\nThe transverse component of the magnetic field tends to increase the cathode\nfall voltage. The increase in the cathode\nfall voltage is necessary for producing energetic electrons for ionization inside the\nchannels. Energetic electrons that have\nsufficient velocity components parallel to\n\nthe magnetic field enter the channels to\nparticipate in the ionization process.\nThose without sufficient parallel velocities\nare reflected by the magnetic-mirror force\n(a consequence of the chosen magneticfield configuration and strength). Because\nthe electrons reflected by the mirror force\nare constrained by the magnetic-field\nlines, the reflected electrons oscillate between the filament and the plenum. The\nlikelihood that these electrons will ionize\nneutral atoms in the plenum region increases as this oscillation continues.\n\nIons formed in the channels are accelerated by the electrostatic-potential gradient across the plasma sheath at the\nplenum. The ions emitted from the sheath\nat the anode plenum form an axially directed beam. The ion beam is neutralized\nby electrons emitted into the beam by the\nfilament. In this respect, the filament provides not only the ionizing electrons but\nalso the neutralizing electrons.\nIt should be pointed out that the choice\nof the electron source used in this device is\nquite general. In the prototype, a coated\nfilament was used. The basic concept of\nthis compact plasma accelerator (CPA) is\nalso compatible with a field-emitter-array\ncathode. The appeal of the field-emitter\napproach lies in a higher current density\nand greater simplicity of integration (no filament heater supply is necessary).\nA prototype of this CPA generated a\nmonoenergetic (80-eV) ion beam of 30-mA\ncurrent at a discharge power of approximately 40 W. The propellant efficiency at\nthis condition was calculated to be approximately 88 percent. The peak ion\ncurrent densities of the beamlets formed\nin the prototype CPA were similar to\nthose measured in gridded ion thrusters\nof much higher power (e.g., 2.3 kW).\nThis work was done by John E. Foster of\nGlenn Research Center.

These actuators are designed especially for use in actuating valves in\nrocket-engine test facilities. They are\nalso adaptable to many industrial uses,\nsuch as steam turbines, process control\nvalves, dampers, motion control, etc.\nThe advantageous features of the improved electrohydraulic linear actuators\nare best described with respect to shortcomings of prior electrohydraulic linear\nactuators that the improved ones are intended to supplant. The shortcomings\nare the following:\n\nNASA Tech Briefs, February 2004\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 They perform unreliably and inconsistently as positioning devices.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Their capabilities for end-of-stroke\nbuffering (that is, deceleration to gentle stops at designated stopping positions) range from unsatisfactory to\nnonexistent, with consequent potential for inducing catastrophic failures.\n\xe2\x80\xa2 It takes long times to manufacture special actuators to meet specifications,\nand the costs of such actuators are\nhigh.\nThe figure depicts one of the improved actuators. The flow of hydraulic\nfluid to the two ports of the actuator\n\ncylinder is controlled by a servo valve\nthat is controlled by a signal from a\nservo amplifier that, in turn, receives\nan analog position-command signal (a\ncurrent having a value between 4 and\n20 mA) from a supervisory control system of the facility. As the position command changes, the servo valve shifts,\ncausing a greater flow of hydraulic\nfluid to one side of the cylinder and\nthereby causing the actuator piston to\nmove to extend or retract a piston rod\nfrom the actuator body. A linear variable differential transformer (LVDT)\ndirectly linked to the piston provides a\n\n25\n\n'
