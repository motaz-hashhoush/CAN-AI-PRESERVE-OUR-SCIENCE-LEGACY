Over time wire insulation can age and fail, often leading to catastrophic events such as system failure or fire. The next generation of wiring must be reliable and sustainable over long periods of time. These features will be achieved by the development of a wire insulation capable of autonomous self-healing that mitigates failure before it reaches a catastrophic level. In order to develop a self-healing insulation material, three steps must occur. First, methods of bonding similar materials must be developed that are capable of being initiated autonomously. This process will lead to the development of a manual repair system for polyimide wire insulation. Second, ways to initiate these bonding methods that lead to materials that are similar to the primary insulation must be developed. Finally, steps one and two must be integrated to produce a material that has no residues from the process that degrades the insulating properties of the final repaired insulation. The self-healing technology, teamed with the ability to identify and locate damage, will greatly improve reliability and safety of electrical wiring of critical systems. This paper will address these topics, discuss the results of preliminary testing, and remaining development issues related to self-healing wire insulation.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20130012527, "name": "Aging Aircraft 2007", "location": "Palm Springs, CA", "id": "d64b1c71f02140fb83a681ac2ccabd30", "startDate": "2007-04-17T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20130012527, "id": "8d210d56e1f04139bac70e84b00251b5", "publicationDate": "2007-04-17T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20130012527.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20130012527/downloads/20130012527.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20130012527/downloads/20130012527.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20130012527/downloads/20130012527.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
