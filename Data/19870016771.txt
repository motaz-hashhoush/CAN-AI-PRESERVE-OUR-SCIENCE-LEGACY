b'Martin Marietta Atomic Oxygen\nLow Earth Orbit Simulation\nby\nGary W. Sjolander and Lyle Bareiss\n(Poster Abstract)\nAn atomic oxygen beam apparatus that produces flux levels and atomic\nkinetic energy similar to that encountered by spacecraft in low earth orbit\n(LEO) is coming on line at Martin Marietta Denver Aerospace, The beam\nappratus consists of an electric discharge ion source, mass filter.,\ndecelerator, and neutralizer. Specific design goals include a 1.3 cm beam\ndiamter, a 5 eV beam energy, and a flux density on the order of 1\xc2\xaeE+15\n\xc2\xae2\nThe total fluence will be on the order of 1.E+19 c m2 for\ncm s\t -1 .\nan 8 hour test\xc2\xae The neutral oxygen beam will expose various materials\ncontained with a large target chamber. Within the chamber will be a rather\ncomplex suite of instrumentation that will allow real-time studies of\nmaterial mass loss and reactant species spatial distribution\xc2\xae In addition,\na UV solar simulator will aid in the understanding of various synergistic\neffects.\nAt present, the AO beam appratus has been checked out through the mass\nfilter\xc2\xae Beam currents in excess of 1 mA at 5000 eV have been measured for\nnitrogen, oxygen, and hydrogen prior to the mass filter; and beam space\ncharge analysis has been confirmed for a hydrogen beam through the mass\nfilter section. Beam uniformity is 8% across a 1\xc2\xae3 cm diameter atomic\noxygen beam at 10 microamperes and 3000 eV\xc2\xae The next phases will include\ndecelerator and neutralizer testing.\nMaterial testing and research in this atomic oxygen environment will\ninclude all materials of interest for LEO spacecraft including space\nstation. Results of ground based testing will provide input data to\ncomputer modeling of long duration mission analyses of atomic oxygen\neffects. Ground based testing will also be compared with past and future\nflight test data through a cooperative effort with Dr\xc2\xae J. Gregory of the\nUniversity of Alabama in Huntsville as part of the Consortium for Materials\nDevelopment in Space.\n\n168\n\n'
