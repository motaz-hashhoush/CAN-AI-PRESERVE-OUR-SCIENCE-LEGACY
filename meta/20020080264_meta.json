Teleoperated robots contribute significantly to reducing human injury levels by performing tasks too hazardous for humans. ANDROS' manufacturer, REMOTEC, Inc., in turn, adopted some of the JPL concepts, particularly the control panel. HAZBOT III has exceptional mobility, employs solid state electronics and brushless DC motors for safer operation, and is designed so combustible gases cannot penetrate areas containing electronics and motors. Other features include the six-degree-of-freedom manipulator, the 30-pound squeeze force parallel jaw gripper and two video cameras, one for general viewing and navigation and the other for manipulation/grasping.", "title": "Robotic Vehicle", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-07T12:53:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-08-27T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20020080264, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20020080264, "isbn": "0-16-045368-2", "id": "de96966a8e134754ac6f44131b312950", "publicationName": "Spinoff 1994", "publicationDate": "1994-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20020080264.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20020080264/downloads/20020080264.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20020080264/downloads/20020080264.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20020080264/downloads/20020080264.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
