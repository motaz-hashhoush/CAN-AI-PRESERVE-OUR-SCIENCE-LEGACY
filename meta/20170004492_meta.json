This directly affects any future missions prescribed to the SLS by allowing management to easily see where employees can be re-allocated to different mission specific projects or assist a project that may be lacking in a specific field. This software is intended to provide proof of NASA's diligence and deliberation in hiring new employees and in providing training and guidance to employees who may have fallen short of expectations. Allowing management to more easily statistically track and monitor the supply and demand of employees with specific experience will help introduce a beneficial culture where employees are given the ability to grow and hone skills which might otherwise atrophy over time. With this new system in place, NASA can prove the employees they hire and already have are exemplary and will remain exemplary to serve the nation as a whole.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 20170004492, "id": "baf89909ee4741b9b39e0ce64a41d81a", "publicationDate": "2017-05-04T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 20170004495, "type": "SEE_ALSO", "title": "Spaceport Command and Control System Software Development", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20170004492.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20170004492/downloads/20170004492.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20170004492/downloads/20170004492.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20170004492/downloads/20170004492.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
