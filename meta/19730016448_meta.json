The measurement program was conducted between October 3, 1970 and October 2, 1971, to empirically determine the cumulative distributions of scattering cross section per unit volume of hydrometeors at heights up to 9 km above the surface and of rain rate at the surface. The measurements were made in southeastern Virginia using a bistatic, continuous-wave, vertically polarized radar system operating at S- and X-band frequencies and tipping-bucket rain gages. The bistatic radar system was configured to represent an interference situation between a radio-relay system and a space communication system Earth terminal; the results may be interpreted as measured distributions of transmission loss for interference due to rain.
