Currently hydrogen is the prime fuel of today\'s space vehicles\n(e.g., Space Shuttle) and featured as a fuel for some prototype vehicles such as the BMW\nseven series model. Hydrogen is a colorless, odorless gas with a 4% lower explosive limit\nwhich makes leak detection a priority.\nIn an effort to support the use of hydrogen, a chemochromic (color changing)\nsensor was developed that is robust, simple to use, and does not require active operation.\nIt can be made into a thin tape which can be conveniently used for leak detection at\nflanges, valves, or outlets. Chemochromic sensors can be either reversible or irreversible;\nhowever, irreversible chemochromic sensors will be analyzed in this report. The\nirreversible sensor is useful during hazardous operations when personnel cannot be\npresent. To actively monitor leaks, testing of the irreversible sensor against\nenvironmental effects was completed and results indicated this material is suitable for\noutdoor use in the harsh beachside environment of Kennedy Space Center. The\nexperiments in this report will give additional results to the environmental testing by\nadding solid rocket booster residue as a variable. The primary motivation for these\nexperiments is to prepare the sensors for the launch pad environment at the Kennedy\nSpace Center. In an effort to simulate the atmosphere at the pads before and after launch,\nthe chemochromic sensors are exposed to solid rocket residue under various conditions.\n\nINTRODUCTION\nHydrogen sensors are subject to interference, and many require an operator to\ncontrol the device. Because hydrogen leaks can create a hazardous environment, a\nremote sensor would be beneficial. Hydrogen fuel is becoming more and more popular\nas fossil fuel supplies are declining. In an effort to help ensure a sale environment when\nusing this highly explosive gas, a chemochromic sensor is under development that\nprovides rapid response in the presence of hydrogen.\nThe sensors are especially designed to be robust and to fit into small areas where\nleaks may occur. There are numerous pipe lines that transport hydrogen throughout the\nlaunch pads. In several areas the connection points are in tight spots and hard-to-view\nareas for operators and via cameras. With hydrogen being a colorless gas, it is quite\ndifficult to detect leaks and some leaks may go unnoticed. The sensor was made with a\nspecial matrix that goes through a chemical reaction that causes a change in color when\nexposed to hydrogen. Because of the color changing phenomenon, the sensor can be left\nduring hazardous operations and does not require any power or operator actions. This is\nespecially important in hydrogen transportation, loading, and storage due to the low\nflammability limit of hydrogen.\n\nEXPERIMENT\nThe experiments were performed on three different sensor formulations. There\nwere four different treatments per formulation, and three different tests were performed\nto each treatment. There was a control sample (C) that consisted of no treatment, a one\nhour treatment (SF1) which was exposed to solid rocket booster residue (SRB) for an\nhour, a three day treatment (SD) which was exposed to SRB residue for three days, and a\nweek treatment (SW) which was exposed to SRB residue for a week. The solid rocket\nresidue was simulated by making a slurry that consisted of 6.60 mL hydrochloric acid of\napproximately 0.lpH, lOOmL of deionized water, and 5.60 grams of alumina oxide\npowder. The fmal pH was approximately of 0.25.\nAll the samples were analyzed for their response to hydrogen and tested for\nstrength. An additional test for reaction with hydrogen was done after environmental\nexposure had taken place for one week. Each sample was exposed to 100% hydrogen in a\nhydrogen (H2) exposure chamber for 15, 30, and 60 seconds. The volume of the chamber\nwas approximately one liter; the flow through the chamber was approximately 398 sccm.\nThe second test was the durability of the chemochromic tapes. The environmental\nexposure took place at the KSC corrosion beach site. At the beach site, tapes were\nexposed to atmospheric conditions located approximately 100 feet from the Atlantic\nOcean. Individual pieces were attached to a stainless steel panel, and the panels were\nplaced on racks. The racks are 5 feet high and oriented 60\xc2\xb0 from the plumb line. The\nsamples were transported back in the laboratory and exposed to 100% hydrogen the same\nway as the previous test. An Instron was used to calculate the tensile strength and\nmodulus of each type of sample. The samples were cut out into unique dog bone shapes\nusing a manual punch. More details on how the tensile strength was obtained will be\ndiscussed later in the paper.\n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS\n\nAfter the hydrogen exposures, the color change was measured using a Konica\nMinolta CR-400 chroma meter. The instrument gives a iE value when measuring the\nsamples. AE measures a difference in color by measuring specific parameters of the film\n(L* , a, and b*) . L* refers to a gradient from light to dark; a* defmes the gradient from\nred to green; and b* the gradient from yellow to blue. The total color difference, AE, is\ncalculated using the L* , a* , and b* values measured for the two colors being compared.\nIt is defined by the equation:\n= ((i L*)2 + (,. a*)2 +(ib*)2)"\t\n\n(Equation 1)\n\nThe greater the AE value, the greater the color contrast. There was a control sample for\neach exposure so the extent of color change could be measured. The longer the tapes\nwere exposed to hydrogen the greater the i\\E. It appears the longer the tapes were\n\n4\n\nsubmerged in the SRB residue the faster they reacted with hydrogen. Below, Figure 1\nshows a graph of the iE versus time of the S2 sample. As the time increases the contrast\nof color does also.\n\nS2\n20.00\n15.00\n10.00\t\n\n::.\t\n\n-\t\n\n.c\n\xe2\x80\xa2SH\n\nH\t\n\nDSD\n\n_____ ___ ___\nSECONDS\n\nFIGURE 1.

The material will fade to a pale grayish\ncolor with an average AE of 16.60.\nThe beach site test went as planned, but the results were somewhat unexpected.\nThe beach site exposure corrupted several of the sensors. All of the samples that were\npreviously submerged in SRB residue and controls were altered. The samples started to\nchange color before H2 testing. Several of sensors were completely changed, whereas\nothers were slig1tly spotted. The beach site samples responded to H 2 faster then the\nsample that had no environmental exposure. The comparison of Si and EV controls for\nthe exposure and the controls for the beach site test are shown in Figure 2.\n\n5\n\n\t\n\nLAB CONTROL vs. BEACH (SI)\n30.00\n\n[1\t\n\n20.00\t\n1:00\t\n\nosc\nSB\n\nSBOIDS\n\nLAB CONTROL vs. BEACH CONTROL (EV)\n30.00\n20.00\n\nI\t\n\n10.00\t\nr\n\n0.00\t\n0\t\n\n15\t\n\nfl\t\n30\t\n\nri\t\n\no Ev-c\noE/-C-B\n\n60\n\nSECOfI)S\nFIGURE 2. Lab control vs. beach control\n\nThe beach site environment had a substantial effect on the sensor. More research will\nneed to be done to determine the mechanism that caused this change.\nThe tensile strength test was the fmal test done on the samples. This test was\nperformed to determine if the SRB exposure affected the strength of the polymer. The\nInstron clamped onto the end of the bones-shaped samples then stretched the sample until\nit broke. The amount of force was measured by the machine as it stretched the sample.\nThe force was divided by the cross-sectional area which gave the stress that the sample is\nexperiencing.\nForce I Area = Stress\t\n\n(Equation 2)\n\nThe force was increased as the sample stretched which caused the stress to increase until\nthe sample broke. The stress needed to break the sample is referred to as the tensile\nstrength. The modulus was also calculated by the Instron test. The modulus is the ability\nthe sample has to resist deformation. Modulus is usually expressed as the ratio of stress\nexerted on the sample to the amount of deformation. Tensile modulus is the ratio of stress\napplied to the elongation which results from the stress. Therefore the modulus is the slope\nof the stress-strain curve.\n\ntensile\nmodulus\n\\\n\nstress-strain\ncurve\n\ntensile\nstrength\n\nstress\n\nstrain (elongation)\nFIGURE 3. Stress strain curve\n\nThe area under the stress-strain curve is the toughness of the material. Toughness is the\namount of energy the sample can endure before it breaks. Toughness is different from\nstrength. If the sample is tough, it does not mean it is strong.

The sensors maintained their mechanical integrity throughout\nthe tests.\n\nI\t\n\nI\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nSynthesis of the chemochromic hydrogen sensor was performed to create a set of samples\nfor testing. The SRB residue enhanced the response of the sensor without affecting the\nsensor modulus or tensile strength when the sample was rinsed after SRB exposure. SRB\nexposure did cause some degradation of the sensors when it was allowed to dry without\nrinsing. When the sensor was exposed to the beach site for a week the samples were\naltered. The chemchromic sensors have previously been tested in outdoor environments,\nbut they have never been tested with SRB residue in an outdoor environment. It appears\nthat leaving the SRB residue on the sample degrades the sensor.\n\n8\n\n'
