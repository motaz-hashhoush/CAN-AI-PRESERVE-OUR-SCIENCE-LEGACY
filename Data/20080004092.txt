Contact chains\nare formed beside the integrated circuits, each contact\nchain formed of the same two layers as the circuits, in\nthe form of conductive segments alternating between\nthe upper and lower layers and with the ends of the\nsegments connected in series through interfaces. A current source passes a current through the series-connected segments, by way of a pair of current tabs connected to opposite ends of the series of segments. While\nthe current flows, voltage measurements are taken between each of a plurality of pairs of voltage tabs, the\ntwo tabs of each pair connected to opposite ends of an\ninterface that lies along the series-connected segments.\nA plot of interface conductances on a normal probability chart, enables prediction of the yield of good integrated circuits from the wafer.\n12 Claims, 8 Drawing Figures\n\nCURRENT\nSOURCE\n\nI\n\n30/f\n\n324/64\n\nL\n\nS.

The voltage measurements\ngrated circuits and eighty-eight test circuits 30, with\n\n5\n\n4,725,773\n\neach test circuit having perhaps eleven interfaces whose\nresistance is measureable. Thus, about one thousand\ninterface resistance, or conductance, measurements can\nbe made. Such a large number of measurements can be\nused to predict the probability of the integrated circuits 5\nfailing because of excessive resistance at one of their\ninterfaces. Each integrated circuit may have perhaps\n1,0oO interfaces. As shown in FIG. 8, applicant establishes a predetermined minimum interface conductance\nlevel such as 1 mHo (1 ohms resistance), or even 0 mho, 10\nat which an integrated circuit is likely to fail. The conductance measurements at the eleven interfaces of each\nof the eighty-eight test circuits is then plotted on a\nnormal probability graph of the type shown in FIG. 8.\nThe conductance for each interface equals the current 15\npassing through the interface divided by the voltage\nbetween a pair of tabs that are connected to opposite\nends of the interface.\nA multiplicity of points 100 are established on the\ngraph of FIG. 8, with each point having an ordinate R 20\nequal to the conductance measured in a measurement.\nPoints of progressively lower conductance have an\nabscissa A that is progressively further from a minimum\nabscissa value 102. The points are spaced apart along\nthe abscissa at probability intervals S about equal to one 25\n,O\ndivided by the total number of points. Thus, if 1O O\nmeasurements are taken, the firstpoint 104 (of greatest\nconductance) will be at the abscissa value of 0.001, or\n0.1%. The next point 106 will be at the abscissa value\n0.2%, etc. When plotted on a normal probability graph 30\nof the type shown in FIG. 8, points further from the\nminimum abscissa level will be progressively closer\ntogether up to the probability of 50%; beyond 50% the\npoints will be progressively further apart in the abscissa\ndirection. An imaginary straight line 110 is fitted to the 35\ncurve so that it is close to lying on all of the points (at\nleast the majority of points of lowest conductivity). The\nline 110 can be extended to provide a useful measurement.\nIt can be seen in FIG. 8 that the point 112 represent- 40\ning the lowest conductance for all 1,0oO measurements\nis still considerably above the lowest acceptable level\nwhich is one mho. (If the lowest acceptable level is\nmuch less than 10 mho, zero can be used as the lower\nlevel). The extension portion 114 of the line 110 will 45\nintercept the minimum conductance level at a point 116\n(representing five nines, or 99.999%). The probability\nof an interface having such a low conductance is indicated along the abscissa of the graph at the point 116,\nwhere the probability is 1-99.999%=0.001%. In other 50\nwords, the probability is 1/100,OOO that an interface\nconductance will drop below the minimum permissible\nlevel for circuit operation. Where each integrated circuit has 1O O interfaces, this indicates that only 1 circuit\n,O\nout of 100 is likely to have a failure. FIG. 8 shows an- 55\nother graph 120 for the test circuits on another wafer,\nwhere the average conductance is lower than in the\ngraph 110. However, the line 120 connecting conductances arranged in order of conductance on the probability graph, shows a smaller slope of conductivity de- 60\ncrease with order of probability. The graph 120 intersects the minimum conductance level at the point 122,\nwhere the probability is 99.9999%, meaning that the\nprobability of an interface failure is 1/1,OOO,O00. The\nnormal probability graphs of FIG. 8 can be plotted by 65\nhand or by a plotter as shown at 94 in FIG. 7.\nThus, the invention provides a test method and apparatus for facilitating the testing of interfaces between a\n\n6\n\npair of at least partially conductive layers on a workpiece which holds one or more integrated circuits. A\ntest circuit includes a contact chain with multiple conductive segments alternating between the different layers and connected in series through interfaces connecting the beginning of a segment on one layer to the end\nof a segment on another layer. The chain includes a pair\nof end tabs at opposite ends of the chain of conductive\nsegments, for passing a current through the chain, and\npairs of tabs spaced along the chain and that are connected to the opposite sides of each interface along the\nchain. A test instrument includes a current source for\npassing current between the end tabs and contacts for\nmeasuring the voltages across each pair of tabs that are\nconnected to the opposite sides of each interface along\nthe chain. The conductance measurements can be plotted on a normal probability graph with measurements of\nlower conductivity spaced progressively along the abscissa. A straight line drawn through the points will\nthen pass through a minimum conductance level at a\ndiscernable probability level. One minus that probability equals the probability of failure of a single interface\non the workpiece, such as in a test circuit or the integrated circuit.\nAlthough particular embodiments of the invention\nhave been described and illustrated herein, it is recognized that modifications and variations may readiiy\noccur to those skilled in the art,and consequently, it is\nintended that the claims be interpreted to cover such\nmodifications and equivalents.\nWhat is claimed is:\n1.
