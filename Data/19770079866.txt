summer for\nan extensive reconnaissance of the outer planets.\n\nRiding atop a Titan Centaur rocket, the Voyagers will\nbe launched from Kennedy Space Center, Fla., on a decadelong odyssey that could take them to as many as 15 major\nheavenly bodies.\n\nThese include giant Jupiter and ringed Saturn, several\nmoons of both planets and possibly Uranus.\n-more-\n\n-2-\n\nMaking measurements and takxng closeup pictures/ the\nVoyagers will return information that could shed new light\non the origin and early history of the solar system and our\nown planet Earth.\nThe first Voyager will be launched about Aug. 20.\n\nThe\n\nsecond is scheduled for launch 12 days later, about Sept. 1.\n\nVoyager 2 will be launched first and Voyager 1 second,\nas Voyager 1 will fly a faster trajectory than its companion\nand reach Jupiter in March, 1979, four months ahead of\nVoyager 2.\n\nAt Saturn encounter Voyager 1 will be about nine\n\nmonths ahead of its sister craft.\n\nAt Jupiter the gravity-assist technique \xe2\x80\x94\n\nusing a\n\nplanet\'s gravitational field to speed up a spacecraft and\nchange its trajectory \xe2\x80\x94 will be used to send the Voyagers\non to Saturn.\n\nWith this "slingshot" technique Voyager 1\n\nwill arrive at Saturn in late summer of 1980, 3.2 years after\nlaunch.\n\nWithout using Jupiter\'s massive gravity, the flight\n\nfrom Earth would require 6.1 years.\n\nWhen it reaches Saturn,\n\nVoyager will have traveled 2.2 billion kilometers\nbillion miles) through space.\n\n-more-\n\n(1.4\n\nAfter completing their planetary missions, the two\nspacecraft will continue outward from the solar system and\nacross the boundary of the wind of charged particles (solar\nwind) that streams outward from the Sun, thus penetrating\ninto interstellar space.\n\nThe Voyager spacecraft are advanced versions of planetary explorers that have studied Mercury, Venus and Mars.\nThe new craft weigh 825 kilograms (1,820 pounds).\n\nThe space-\n\ncraft differ from their Mariner and Viking predecessors in\nmany respects, due primarily to the environment into which\nthey will venture and the great distances across which they\nmust communicate with Earth.\n\nSince the amount of sunlight\n\nwhich strikes the outer planets is only a small fraction of\nthat which reaches Earth, the Voyagers cannot depend on\nsolar energy but must use nuclear power \xe2\x80\x94\nthermoelectric generators.\n\nradioisotope\n\nThe Voyagers are dominated by\n\nthe largest communications antennas yet flown on planetary\nmissions:\n\n3.7 meters\n\n(12 feet) in diameter.\n\nThe Voyagers are more automatic and independent of\nEarth-based control than earlier planetary spacecraft.\n\nThe\n\ngreat distances across which radio signals between Earth\nand Voyagers must travel and the long lifetime of the mission\nrequire that the Voyagers be able to care for themselves and\nperform long, detailed and complex scientific surveys without\ncontinual\n\ncommanding from the ground.\n-more-\n\n-4-\n\nThey are the first planetary spacecraft to carry an\nexpendable solid-fueled propulsion module for use during\nlaunch.\n\nAfter launch, a 68,000-newton-thrust\n\n(15,300-lb.-\n\nthrust) solid-propellant rocket motors on the propulsion\nmodules will place the spacecraft on their flight paths to\nJupiter.\n\nThey will use steering thrusters for trajectory corrections.\n\nSome trajectory correction maneuvers will require\n\nengine burns of more than an hour \xe2\x80\x94\n\nin some cases spread\n\nover several days.\n\nEach Voyager will use 11 instruments including the\nspacecraft radio to study the planets, their satellites, the\nrings of Saturn, the magnetic regions surrounding the planets\nand interplanetary space.\n\nThe instrument payload weighs\n\n105 kg (231 Ib.).\n\nThe Voyagers will carry wide-angle and narrow-angle\ntelevision cameras, cosmic ray detectors, infrared spectrometers and radiometers, low-energy charged-particle detectors,\nmagnetometers, photopolarimeters, planetary radio astronomy\nreceivers, plasma and plasma wave instruments and ultraviolet\nspectrometers.\n-more-\n\n-5-\n\nThe television cameras will provide pictures of Jupiter\nand Saturn of greater resolution than any taken from Earth\nor by the earlier Pioneer 10 and 11 spacecraft.\nstudy Jupiter for eight months.\n\nThey will\n\nThe cameras should also take\n\nthe first high resolution, closeup photos of the Galilean\nsatellites of Jupiter, the major satellites of Saturn and\nSaturn\'s rings.\n\n(Pioneer 11 is now on a trajectory which\n\nwill take it through Saturn\'s rings in 1979, but the pictures\ntaken \xe2\x80\x94\n\nif any \xe2\x80\x94\n\nwill have less resolution than the Voyager\n\nimages by a factor of 100.)\n\nThe other Voyager instruments will study the atmosphere\nof the planets and their satellites, their magnetosphere and\nthe relationships between these regions and the solar wind\nthat streams through interplanetary space and the radio signals from Jupiter (which emits the strongest radio noise in\nour sky except the Sun).\n\nOther objectives include all-sky\n\nsurveys of interplanetary space and gravitational fields.\n\nAn option is being maintained to send Voyager 2 on to\nthe planet Uranus, 20 times farther from the Sun than Earth.\nEncounter, which would occur in January 1986, would permit\nthe first closeup examination of its recently discovered\nrings.\n\nThe Uranus option will be exercised only if primary\n\ngoals of Saturn have been met by the first Voyager and the\noperating condition of the second Voyager warrants the added\nfour-year trip.\n-more-\n\n-6-\n\nThe Voyager spacecraft receive a large increase in\nvelocity as a result of their close flyby of the planet\nJupiter.\n\nThis gravity-assist velocity increase allows the\n\nspacecraft to reach Saturn in the relatively short time of\n3.2 to 4 years with a launch vehicle that is only slightly\nlarger than required for Jupiter missions.\n\nThis opportunity\n\nto send a spacecraft to Saturn following a close flyby of\nJupiter occurs approximately every 20 years.\n\nThe opportunity\n\nfor the Uranus option is txie result of the alignment of\nJupiter, Saturn and Uranus which happens only once every\n45 years.\n\nProject Voyager represents the next step in the United\nStates\' program of systematic planetary exploration in which\nthe solar system is used as a natural laboratory.\n\nBy being\n\nable to compare the similarities and differences of the\nvarious planets, scientists expect to learn more about the\nprocesses that affect the Earth and better understand the\nhistory of the solar system.\n\nUntil recently our knowledge of Jupiter and Saturn was\nonly rudimentary.\n\nGround-based studies by optical infrared\n\nand radio astronomy defined the most basic properties of\nJupiter and Saturn and their satellites and hinted at the\nunique scientific potential of these systems.\n-more-\n\n-7-\n\n0\n\nIn 1973 and 1974 a first close-up look at Jupiter and%\nits system was provided by two Pioneer spacecraft.\n\nAs\n\nPioneers 10 and 11 sped past Jupiter, their instruments\nbegan to reveal the complexity of its atmosphere and the\nextent and strength of the Jovian magnetosphere.\n\nVoyager\n\nis the next logical step in the exploration of the Jovian\nsystem.\n\nAlso, by carrying out detailed exploration of\n\nSaturn, these spacecraft will provide a fascinating perspective for detailed comparisons of a host of unfamiliar worlds.\n\nJupiter and Saturn are the largest planets.\n\nTogether\n\nwith their many satellites they dominate the solar syss\n\ntern.\n\nThe diameter of Jupiter is 10 times that of Earth, and\n\nit contains more matter than all of the other planets put\ntogether.\n\nWith its retinue of 13 moons, four of them as\n\nlarge as planets, Jupiter is actually the center of a miniature solar system like the Sun and planets.\n\nSaturn also has a system of many satellites\n\nand includes,\n\nin addition, two unique features, a spectacular ring system\nwhich appears to be composed mainly of tiny pieces of ice\nand snow and one large satellite, Titan, with an atmosphere\nas massive as that of the Earth.\n\nIn any program of planetary\n\nexploration study of the Jovian and Saturnian systems is of\nparamount interest for understanding the origin and evolution\nof the solar system.\n-more-\n\n-8-\n\nIn spite of their great size, Jupiter and Saturn are\nmysterious worlds.\n\nBoth are giant balls of gas with no\n\napparent solid surface.\ngen and helium.\n\nBoth are composed largely of hydro-\n\nThese planets best represent the original\n\nmaterials from which the Sun and all the planets \xe2\x80\x94\nEarth \xe2\x80\x94 were formed.\n\nincluding\n\nBoth Jupiter and Saturn constitute\n\nminature but uniquely accessible laboratories for study of\nphenomenon of wide-ranging astrophysical interest.\n\nLike the stars, Jupiter and Saturn each have their own\ninternal energy sources, radiating nearly twice as much\nenergy as they receive from the Sun.\n\nAs Pioneer 10 and 11\n\nmeasurements revealed, Jupiter has a strong magnetic field\nand is surrounded by radiation belts similar to the Van Allen\nbelts around the Earth.\n\nThe vast, rapidly spinning magneto-\n\nsphere and radiation belts of Jupiter make it a major source\nof several types of radio radiation.\n\nThe atmospheres of these giant planets are driven by\nthe same forces that act on Earth\'s atmosphere, but on a\nmuch larger scale.\n\nMajor cyclones, like the Great Red Spot\n\nof Jupiter, are thousands of miles across and persist for\ncenturies.\n\nTheir atmospheres contain multiple cloud layers\n\neach with their own temperature and chemical composition.\n-more-\n\n\xc2\xab Q_\n\nThe four largest satellites of Jupiter, lo, Europa,\nGanymede and Callisto, provide a varying and fascinating\nmicrocosm of unique worlds.\n\nSome are composed largely of\n\nrock, some of ice, some of water.\n\nTheir surfaces probably\n\nrange from lunar-like cratered plains, to salt-covered beds\nof extinct seas, to exotic landforms created out of ice\nand mud.\n\nIn ice and water-dominated regimes, familiar geo-\n\nlogic processes will take place thousands of times faster\nthan on a rocky planet.\nare expected as well.\n\nTotally unfamiliar geologic forms\nMost satellites of Saturn are\n\napparently also composed primarily of ice.\n\nBut Titan, the\n\nlargest satellite in the solar system, has in addition an\natmosphere similar in size to that of the Earth\'s\n\nbut very\n\ndifferent in composition.\n\nScientists expect that organic molecules are being\ncreated today in the atmosphere of Titan and that this\nstrange, cold satellite may even provide clues to the\norigin of life on Earth.\n\nThe three spectacular rings that surround Saturn may be\nthe remains of a satellite that came too close and was broken\nup by the strong tidal forces of the planet\n\nor they may be\n\nremnants of material from the birth of the solar system\nthat never coalesced to form a large moon.\n-more-\n\n-10-\n\nJupiter orbits the Sun at a distance of 778 million\nkm (483 million

Communications\ncapability, hardware reliability, navigation and temperature control are among the major challenges. The\nspacecraft are identical. Each can meet the objectives\nof either mission and their various options.\nEach Voyager consists of a mission module \xe2\x80\x94 the\nplanetary vehicle \xe2\x80\x94 and a propulsion module, which\nprovides the final energy increment necessary to inject\nthe mission module into the Jupiter transfer trajectory. The propulsion module is jettisoned within\nminutes after the required volocity is attained. (For\npurposes of mission description, "spacecraft" and\n"mission module" will be used interchangeably. In\ndescribing the prelaunch configuration and launch\nphase, "spacecraft" will refer to the combined "mission module" and "propulsion module.")\nThe mission module after injection weighs 825 kg\n(1,820 Ibs.), including a 105 kg (231 Ib.) science instrument payload. The propulsion module, with its\nlarge solid propellant rocket motor, weighs 1.220 kg\n(2,690 Ibs.). The spacecraft adaptor joins the spacecraft with the Centaur stage of the launch vehicle.\nIt weighs 47.2 kg (104 Ibs.) Total launch weight\nof the spacecraft is 2,100 kg (4,630 Ibs.).\nTo assure proper operation for the four-year\nflight to Saturn, and perhaps well beyond, mission\nmodule subsystems have been designed with high reliability and extensive redundancy.\nLike the Mariners that explored the inner planets\nand the Viking Mars Orbiters, the Voyagers are stabilized on three axes using the Sun and a star (Canopus)\nas celestial reference points.\nThree engineering subsystems are programmable for\non-board control of spacecraft functions. (only trajectory correction maneuvers must be enabled by ground\ncommand.) These subsystems are the computer command\nsubsystems (CCS), the flight data subsystem (FDS) and\nthe attitude and articulation control subsystem (AACS).\n- more -\n\n-16-\n\nThe memories of these units can be updated or\nmodified by ground command at any time.\nHot gas jets provide thrust for attitude stabilization as well as for trajectory correction maneuvers.\nA nuclear power source \xe2\x80\x94 three radioisotope\nthermoelectric generators \xe2\x80\x94 provides the spacecraft\nelectrical power.\nThe science instruments required to view the planets\nand their moons are mounted on a two-axis scan platform\nat the end of the science boom for precise pointing.\nOther body-fixed and boom-mounted instruments are\naligned for proper interpretation of their measurements.\nData storage capacity on the spacecraft is about\n536 million bits of information \xe2\x80\x94 the equivalent of\nabout 100 full-resolution photos.\nDual frequency communication links \xe2\x80\x94 S-band and\nX-band -- provide accurate navigation data and large\namounts of science information during planetary encounter periods (up to 115,200 bits per second at\nJupiter and 44,800 bps at Saturn).\nDominant feature of the spacecraft is the 3.66meter (12-foot) diameter high-gain antenna which will\npoint toward Earth continually after the initial 80\ndays of flight.\nWhile the high-gain antenna dish is white, most\nvisible parts of the spacecraft are black \xe2\x80\x94 blanketed\nor wrapped for thermal control and micrometeoroid protection. A few small areas are finished in gold foil\nor have polished aluminum surfaces.\nStructure and Configuration\nThe basic mission module structure is a 29.5 kg\n(65 Ib.) 10-sided aluminum framework with 10 electronics packaging compartments. The structure is\n47 centimeters (18.5 inches) high and 1.78m (5.8 ft.)\nacross from side to side. The electronics assemblies\nare structural elements of the 10-sided box.\n- more -\n\n- y\n\nSCIENCE\n\nSTEERABLE\nPLATFORM\n\nVOYAGER\n\nINSTRUMENT\n\n;\n\nPLASMA\n\nWIDE\nANGLE\n\n7\n\nTV\n\n\'^m^-\xc2\xb1\n\nCOSMIC RAY\n\n/\n\nHIGH-GAIN\nPifENNA\n\nLOW-GAIN ANTENNA\n\nI\n\nEXTENDABLE\nMAGNETOMETER\n\nNARROW\nANGLE\n\nBOOM\n\nTV\n\n3PHOTOn .POLARIMETER\n\nSTAR TRACKERS\nINFRARED\nINTERFEROMETER\n\nRADiOISOTOPE\nTHERMOELECTRIC\nGENERATORS\n\nAND RADIOMETtef?\n\nTHRUSTERS\nCALIBRATION PANEL\n\nIS H HI\n\nPLANETARY RADIO\nASTRONOMY AND\nPLASMA "WAVE\nANTENNA\n\n-18-\n\nThe spherical propellant tank, which supplies\nfuel to hydrazine thrusters for attitude control and\ntrajectory correction maneuvers (TCM) , occupies the center\ncavity of the decagon. Propellant lines carry hydrazine to 12 small attitude control and four TCM\nthrusters on the mission module and to larger thrust\nvector control engines on the propulsion module.\nThe 3.66 m (12 ft.) diameter high-gain parabolic\nreflector is supported above the basic structure by a\ntubular trusswork. The antenna reflector has an aluminum honeycomb core and is surfaced on both sides by\ngraphite epoxy laminate skins. Attachment to the\ntrusses is along a 1.78 m (70 inch) diameter support\nring. The Sun sensor protrudes through a cutout in\nthe antenna dish. An X-baud feed horn is at the\ncenter of the reflector. Two S-band feed horns are\nmounted back- to-back with the X-band sub-reflector,\ntransparent at S-band, to the high-gain dish. The\nother functions as the low-gain antenna.\nLouver assemblies for temperature control are\nfastened to the outer faces of four of the electronics\ncompartments. Top and bottom of the 10-sided structure are enclosed with multi-layer thermal blankets.\nTwo Canopus star tracker units are mounted sideby-side and parallel atop the upper ring of the decagon.\nThree radioisoptope thermoelectric generators are\nassembled in tandem on a deployable boom hinged on an\noutrigger arrangement of struts attached to the basic\nstructure. The RTG boom is constructed of steel and\ntitanium. Each unit, contained in a beryllium outer\ncase, 40.6 Cm(16 in.) in diameter, 50.8 cm (20 in.)\nlong and weighs 39 kg (86 lb.).\nThe science boom, supporting the instruments most\nsensitive to radiation, is located 180 degrees from the\nRTG boom and is hinged to a truss extending out from\nthe decagon and behind the high-gain antenna. The\nboom, 2.3 n (7 1/2 ft.) long, is a bridgework of graphite epoxy tubing. Attached on opposite sides of the\nboom at its mid-point are the cosmic ray and lowenergy charged particle instruments. Farther out on\nthe boom is the plasma science instrument.\nThe two-axis scan platform is mounted at the end\nof the boom and provides precision pointing for four\nremote- sens ing instruments \xe2\x80\x94 the ultraviolet spectrometer, infrared spectrometer and radiometer,\n- more -\n\n-19-\n\nVOYAGER RADIOISOTOPE\nTHERMOELECTRIC GENERATOR\n\nEND ENCLOSURE\n\nBERYLLIUM END DOME\n\nBERYLLIUM OUTER CASE\nGAS\nMANAGEMENT\nASSEMBLY\n\nRIB/FIN\n\nSiGe\nUNICOUPLE\nCONVERTER\n\nCOUPLE\nATTACHMENT\nBOLT\n\nPRESSURE RELIEF -\xc2\xbb\nDEVICE\nSELF ALIGNING MOUNT -1\n\nMO/ASTROQUARTZ\nMULTI-FOIL INSULATION\n"\xe2\x80\x94 RADIOISOTOPE HEAT SOURCE\n\n-20-\n\nphotopolarimeter and a two-camera imaging science subsystem.

The closest platform-mounted instrument\n6.7 m (21 ft.) away.\nA polarimetric calibration target, called a\nbrewster plate, is mounted atop the mission module\nstructure and aligned so that the photopolarimeter\nviews the target during science maneuvers planned for\nthe planetary phases of the mission.\nA pair of 10 m (33 ft.) whip antennas are deployed\nfrom a position external to the top ring of the basic\nstructure and looking "down" between the RTG boom outrigger members. The antennas, which form a right angle,\nare part of the planetary radio astronomy (PRA) instrument package and are shared with another instrument,\nthe plasma wave science unit (PWS). The PRA and PWS\nassemblies are body-mounted adjacently. The antennas,\nberyllium copper tubing, are rolled flat in their\nhousing prior to deployment by small electric motors.\nThe magnetic fields investigation experiment consists of an electronics subassembly located in one of\nthe mission module electronics bays and four magnetometers \xe2\x80\x94 two high-field sensors affixed to the\nspacecraft and two low-field sensors mounted on a\n13m (43 ft.) deployable boom. The boom, constructed\nof epoxy glass, spirals from its stowed position within\nan aluminum cylinder and forms a rigid triangular mast\nwith one magnetometer attached to its end plate and\nanother positioned 6 m (20 ft.l closer to the _spacecraft. The mast itself weighs only 2.3 kg (5 Ibs.),\nless than the cabling running its length and carrying\npower to and data from the magnetometers. The boom\nhousing is a 23 cm (9 in.) diameter cylinder, 66 cm\n(26 in.) long, supported by the RTG outrigger.

Hydrazine fuel is\nsupplied from the mission module.\nA pair of batteries and a remote driver module for\npowering the valve drivers to the thrust vector control\nengines are positioned on the outer face of the cylindrical propulsion module structure.\nA 0.37 sg. m (4 sq. ft.) shunt radiator-science\ncalibration target faces outward from the propulsion\nmodule truss adapter toward the scan platform. The\ndual-purpose structure is a flat sandwich of two\naluminum radiating surfaces lining a honeycomb core.\nThrough an arrangement of power collectors and emitter\nresistors between the plates, any portion of the electrical power from the RTGs can be radiated to space as\nheat. The outer surface also serves as a photometric\ncalibration target for the remote sensing science\ninstruments on the scan platform.\nThe shunt radiator, as well as the propulsion\nmodule truss adapter, remain part of the mission module\nwhen the propulsion module is jettisoned.\nSteel alloy-gold foil plume deflectors extend\nfrom the propulsion module structure to shield the\nstowed RTGs and scan platform from rocket exhaust during\nengine firing.\nThe spacecraft adapter, an aluminum truncated cone,\njoins the propulsion module with the Centaur stage of\nthe launch vehicle. The adapter, 0.71 m (30 in.) tall,\n1.6 m (63 in.) in diameter at the base (Centaur attachment), 1.0 m (39 in.) at the spacecraft separation\njoint and weighs 47.2 kg (104 Ib.). The adapter remains\nwith the Centaur rocket stage.\n\n- more -\n\n-22-\n\nLaunch Configuration\nSome mechanical elements of the spacecraft must be\nrigidly restrained during the severe launch vibration\nenvironment. Following the launch phase appendages\nwhich were latched securely within the Centaur stage\nnose fairing are deployed to their cruise positions.\nThe spacecraft pyrotechnic subsystem provides\nSimple and positive deployment with explosive squibs.\nDevices stowed securely during launch and released for\ndeployment by the pyrotechnic system are the science\nboom, RTG boom and magnetometer boom.\nThe pyrotechnic subsystem also routes power to\ndevices to separate the spacecraft from the launch\nvehicle, activates the propulsion module batteries,\nignites the solid propellant rocket motor, seals off\nthe propellant line carrying hydrazine from the\nmission module to the propulsion module, jettisons\nthe propulsion module and releases the Infrared Radiometer and .Interfermeter Spectrometer insrument-s dust\ncover.\nCommunications\nCommunications with the Voyager spacecraft will\nbe by radio link between Earth tracking stations and a\ndual frequency radio system aboard the spacecraft.\nThe "uplink" operates at S-band, carrying commands and ranging signals from ground stations to one\nof a pair of redundant receivers. The "downlink" is\ntransmitted from the spacecraft at S-band and X-band\nfrequencies.\nThe onboard communications system also includes\na programmable flight data subsystem (FDS), modulation\ndemodulation subsystem (MDS), data storage subsystem (DSS) and high gain and low gain antennas.\nThe FDS, one of the three onboard computers, controls the science instruments and formats all science\nand engineering data for telemetering to Earth. The\ntelemetry modulation unit (TMU) of the MDS feeds data\nto the downlink. The flight command unit of the MDS\nroutes ground commands received by the spacecraft.\n- more -\n\n-23-\n\nOnly one receiver will be powered at any one\ntime with the redundant receiver at standby. The\nreceiver will operate continuously during the\nmission at about 2113 MHz. Different frequency\nranges have been assigned to the radio frequency subsystems of each spacecraft. The receiver can be used\nwith either the high gain or low gain antenna.\nThe S-band transmitter consists of two redundant\nexciters and two redundant RF power amplifiers of\nwhich any combination is possible. Only one exciter-amplifier combination will operate at any one\ntime. Selection of the combanation will be by onboard\nfailure detection logic within the computer command\nsubsytem (CCS), with ground command backup. The same\narrangement of exciter-amplifier combinations makes\nup the X-band transmitting unit.\nOne S-band and both X-band amplifiers employ\ntraveling wave tubes (TWT). The second S-band unit\nis a solid-state amplifier. The S-band transmitter\nis capable of operating at 9.4 watts or at 28.3 watts\nwhen switched to high power and can radiate from both\nantennas. X-band power output is 12 watts and 21.3\nwatts. X-band uses only the high gain antenna. (S-band and\nX-band will never operate at high power simultaneously).\nWhen no uplink signal is being received, the\ntransmitted S-band frequency of about 2295 MHz and\nX-band frequency of 8418 MHz originate in the S-band\nexciter\'s auxiliary oscillator or in a separate ultra\nstable oscillator (one-way tracking-) . With the\nreceiver phase-locked to an uplink signal, the receiver provides the frequency source for both transmitters (two-way tracking). The radio system can also\noperate with the receiver locked to an uplink signal\nwhile the downlink carrier frequencies are determined\nby the onboard oscillators (two-way noncoherent\ntracking).\nAt present, only the 64-m (210-ft.) antenna\nstations of the Deep Space Network can receive the\ndownlink X-band signal. Both the 64-m and the 26-m\n(85-ft.) antenna stations are capable of receiving at\nS-band.\nThe X-band downlink will not be in use during\nabout the first 80 days of the mission \xe2\x80\x94 until the\nEarth is within the beam of the spacecraft\'s high gain\nantenna.\n- more -\n\n-24-\n\nCommunications during launch, near-Earth and early\ncruise phase operations will be confined to S-band and\nthe low gain antenna. An exception occurs during the\nfirst week of flight when the spacecraft, on inertial\ncontrol, points the high gain antenna toward Earth to\nsupport instrument calibration and an optical navigation\nhigh-rate telecommunications link test.\nThe high gain antenna, with a 3.66-m-diameter\n(12 ft.) parabolic reflector, provides a highly directional beam. The low gain antenna provides essentially\nuniform coverage in the direction of Earth.\nUnder normal conditions after the first 80 days\nof the mission, all communications \xe2\x80\x94 both S-band and\nX-band \xe2\x80\x94 are via the high gain antenna. X-band is\nturned off, however, and the S-band transmitter and receiver are switched to the low gain antenna during\nperiodic science maneuvers and trajectory correction\nmaneuvers.\nThe S-band downlink is always on, operating at high\npower during maneuvers or during the cruise phase only\nwhen the 26 m {85 ft.) antenna DSN stations are tracking\nlow power whenever x-band is on. At Saturn, both S-band\nand X-band transmitters will be at low power when gyros\nand tape recorder are on simultaneously.\nCommanding the Spacecraft\nGround commands are used to put into execution selected flight sequences or to cope with unexpected events.\nCommands can be issued in either a predetermined timed\nsequence via onboard program control or directly as received from the ground. Most commands will be issued by\nthe spacecraft\'s computer command subsystem (CCS) in its\nrole as "sequencer of events" and by the flight data\nsubsystem (FDS) as controller of the science instruments.\nAll communications between spacecraft and Earth will\nbe in digital form. Command signals, transmitted at 16\nbits per second (bps) to the spacecraft, will be detected\nin the flight command unit and routed to the CCS for further routing to their proper destination. Ground commands to the spacecraft fall into two major categories;\ndiscrete comands and coded commands.\n- more -\n\n-25-\n\nA discrete command causes a single action on the\nspacecraft. For example, DC-2D switches the S-band\namplifier to high power; DC-2DR, S-band amplifier low\npower,\' DC-2E, S-band radiates from high gain antenna;\nDC-2ER, S-band transmits low gain. Coded commands are\nthe transfer of digital data from the computer command\nsystem or from the ground via the CCS to user subsystems.\nSubsystems receiving coded commands are flight data, attitude and articulation control, modulation-demodulation,\ndata storage and power.\nGround commands back up all critical spacecraft\nfunctions which, in a standard mission, are initiated\nautomatically by onboard logic. Command modulation will\nbe off during science maneuvers and trajectory correction\nmaneuvers unless a spacecraft emergency arises.\nDownlink Telemetry\nData telemetered from the spacecraft will consist\nof engineering and science measurements prepared for\ntransmission by the flight data subsystem, telemetry\nmodulation unit and data storage subsystem. The encoded\ninformation will indicate voltages, pressures, temperatures, television pictures and other values\nmeasured by the spacecraft telemetry sensors and science\ninstruments.\nTwo telemetry channels \xe2\x80\x94 low rate and high rate \xe2\x80\x94\nare provided for the transmission of spacecraft data.\nThe low rate channel functions only at S-band at a sinal.p\n40 bits per second data rate and contains real time engineering data exclusively. It is on only during\nplanetary encounters when the high rate channel is\noperating at X-band.\nThe high rate channel is on throughout the mission,\noperates at either S-band or X-band and contains the\nfollowing types of data:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Engineering only at 40 bps or\n1,200 bps (the rate usually\noccurs only during launch and\ntrajectory correction maneuvers)\ntransmitted at S-band only.\n\n- more -\n\n-26-\n\nReal-time cruise science and\nengineering at 2,560, 1,280, 640,\n320, 160 and 80 b.p.s. (40, 20\nand 10 bps may be used for\npost-Saturn operations) transmitted at S-band only.\nReal time encounter general\nscience and engineering at 7.2\nkilobits per second (a special\n115.2 kbps rate will be\navailable for brief periods at\nJupiter for the planetary radio\nastronomy and plasma wave instruments) transmitted at X-band only.\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nReal time encounter general\nscience, engineering and television at 115.2, 89.6, 67.2,\n44.8, 29.9, and 19.2 kbps\ntransmitted at X-band only.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nReal time encounter general science and engineering, plus tape\nrecorder playback, at 67.2, 44.8\nand 29.9 kbps transmitted at\nX-band only.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nPlay back recorded data only at\n21.6 and 7.2 kbps transmitted\nat X-band only.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nMemory data stored in the three\nonboard computers \xe2\x80\x94 CCS, FDS and\nAACS \xe2\x80\x94 read out and played back\nat 40 or 1,200 bps transmitted\nat either S-band or X-band\n(treated as engineering data).\n\nThe numerous data rates for each type of telemetered\ninformation are required by the changing length of the\ntelecommunications link with Earth and the possible ad-<verse effects of Earth weather upon reception of X-band\nradio signals. The S-band cruise science primary telemetry rate is 2.560 bos.\nLesser rates result in reduced\ninstrument sampling and will be used only when the telecommunications link cannot support the higher rate.\n- more -\n\n-27-\n\nIn order to allow real time transmission of video\ninformation at each encounter, the flight data subsystem\nwill handle the imaging data at six downlink rates from\n115.2 to 19.2 kbps. The 115.2-kbps rate recresents\nthe standard full frame readout at 48 seconds\nper frame) of the TV vidicon. Under normal conditions,\nthis rate will be used at Jupiter. Full frame, full\nresolution TV from Saturn can be obtained by increasing\nthe frame readout time to 144 seconds (3:1 slow scan)\nand transmitting the data at 44.8 kbps a number\nof other slow scan and frame edit options are available\nto match the capability of the telecommunications link.\nThe data storage subsystem can record at two\nrates: TV pictures, general science and engineering at\n115.2 kbps; general science and engineering only at\n7.2 kbps (engineering is acquired at only"l,200\nb.p.s., but is formatted with filler to match the recorder input rate). The tape transport is belt driven.\nIts 1/2-inch magnetic tape is 328m (1,075 ft.)\nlong and is divided into eight tracks which are recorded\nsequentially one track at a time. Total recycleable\nstorage capacity is about 536 million bits \xe2\x80\x94 the equivalent of 100 TV pictures. Playback is at four\nspeeds \xe2\x80\x94 57.6, 33.6, 21.6 and 7.2kbps.\nTracking the Spacecraft\nTo achieve the desired maneuver and flyby accuracies for a multi-planet/satellite encounter mission^\nvery precise navigation is required.\nTo provide the standard Doppler tracking data,\nthe S-band signal transmitted from Earth is received at\nthe spacecraft, changed in frequency by a known ratio\nand retransmitted to Earth. It is possible to precisely determine the transmitted downlink frequency\nwhile measuring the Doppler shifted received signal,\nthereby measuring spacecraft velocity. This is called\ncoherent two-way tracking. One-way tracking is when no\nuplink signal is received and the downlink carrier frequency is provided by an onboard oscillator. Noncoherent\ntwo-way tracking occurs when uplink and downlink carriers\nare operating independently.\n\n- more -\n\n-28-\n\n(When both S-band and X-band transmitters are on,\nX-band frequency will always be 11/3 times the S-band\nfrequency regardless of the frequency source -- spacecraft receiver, ultra stable oscillator or S-band\nexciter auxiliary oscillator.)\nDistance or range to the spacecraft is measured\nin the coherent two-way configuration by transmitting\na digital code (ranging modulation) on the uplink,\nturning this code around in the spacecraft and sending\nit back to the ground. By measuring the total elapsed\ntime between transmitting and receiving the code at the\nground station and knowing such factors as the speed\nof light, turnaround delay and relative velocities of\nthe spacecraft and tracking station, it is possible to\ndetermine spacecraft range.\nDual frequency ranging (both S-band and X-band\nranging on) will be conducted during planetary operations phases of the mission and during the cruise\nphases when the Deep Space Network\'s 64-m (21 Qft. antennas are tracking. Special:three-way dualfrequency ranging cycles will be conducted while two\nor more ground stations on two continents are\ntracking the spacecraft.\nAll ranging modulation is turned off during\nscience maneuvers, trajectory correction maneuvers\nand planetary occultations.\nPower\nThe Voyager power subsystem supplies all electrical power to the spacecraft by generating, converting,\nconditioning and switching the power.\nPower source for the mission module is an array\nof three radioisotope thermoelectic generators (RTGs),\ndeveloped by the U.S. Energy Research and Development\nAdministration (ERDA). The propulsion module, active\nonly during the brief injection phase of the mission,\nuses a separate battery source.\nThe RTG units, mounted in tandem on a deployable\nboom and connected in parallel, convert to electricity\nthe heat released by the isotopic decay of Plutonium238.\n- more -\n\n-29-\n\nEach isotope heat source has a capacity of 2400\nthermal watts with a resultant maximum electrical\npower output of 160 watts at the beginning of the mission. There is a gradual decrease in power output.\nThe minimum total power available from the three\nRTGs ranges from about 423 watts within a few hours\nafter launch to 384 watts after the spacecraft passes\nSaturn.\nSpacecraft power requirements from launch to postSaturn operations are characterized by this general\npower timeline: launch and post-launch, 235 to 265\nwatts; interplanetary cruise, 320 to 365 watts; Jupiter encounter, 384 to 401 watts; Saturn encounter,\n377 to 382 watts; and post-Saturn, less than 365\nwatts.\nTelemetry measurements have been selected to provide the necessary information for power management\nby ground command, if needed.\nThe RTGs will reach full power about six to\neight hours after launch. During prelaunch operations and until about one minute after liftoff, the\ngenerator interiors are kept filled with an inert\ngas to prevent oxidation of its hot components.\nVenting the generators to space vacuum is achieved\nwith a pressure relief device actuated when the outside ambient pressure drops below 10 psia.\nPower from the RTGs is held at a constant 30\nvolts d.c. by a shunt regulator. The 30 volts is supplied directly to some spacecraft users and is\nswitched to others in the power distribution\nsubassembly. The main power inverter also is supplied\nthe 30 volts d.c. for conversion to 2.4 kHz square wave\nused by most spacecraft subsystems. Again, the a.c.\npower may be supplied directly to users or can be\nswitched on or off by power relays.\nCommand actuated relays control the distribution\nof power in the spacecraft. Some relays function as\nsimple on-off switches and others transfer power\nfrom one module to another within a subsystem.\nAmong the users of d.c. power, in addition to\nthe inverter, are the radio subsystem, gyros, propulsion isolation valves, some science instruments,\nmost temperature control heaters and the motors which\ndeploy the planetary radio astronomy antennas.\n- more-\n\n-30-\n\nOther elements of the spacecraft use the 2.4\nkHz power.\nThere are two identical 2.4 kHz power inverters \xe2\x80\x94\nmain and standby. The main inverter is on from launch\nand remains on throughout the mission. In case of\na malfunction or failure in the main inverter, the\npower chain, after a 1.5-second delay is switched\nautomatically to the standby inverter. Once the switchover is made, it is irreversible.\nA 4.8 kHz sync and timing signal from the flight\ndata subsystem is used as a frequency reference in the\ninverter. The frequency is divided by two and the\noutput is 2.4 kHz plus-or-minus 0.002 per cent. This\ntiming signal is sent, ?n turn, to the computer command\nsubsystem which contains the spacecraft\'s master clock.\nBecause of the long mission lifetime, charged\ncapacitor energy storage bank are used instead of\nbatteries to supply the short term extra power demanded by instantaneous overloads which would cause\nthe main d.c. power voltage to dip below acceptable\nlimits. A typical heavy transient overload occurs\nat turn-on of a radio power amplifier.\nFull output of the RTGs, a constant power source,\nmust be used or dissipated in some way to prevent\noverheating of the generator units or d.c. voltage\nrising above allowed maximum. This is controlled by\na shunt regulator which dumps excess RTG output power\nabove that required to operate the spacecraft. The\nexcess power is dissipated in resistors in a shunt\nradiator mounted outside the spacecraft and radiated\ninto space as heat.\nTwo batteries independently supply unregulated\nd.c. power to a remote driver module (RDM) for powering valve drivers to the thrust vector control engines\non the propulsion module during the injection phase\nof the mission. The batteries and the RDM are located\nin the propulsion module which is jettisoned a few\nminutes after the mission module is injected onto a\nJupiter transfer trajectory. Each battery is composed\nof 22 silver oxide-zinc cells with a capacity of 1200\nampere seconds at 28 to 40 volts, depending upon the\nload.\n\n- more -\n\n-31-\n\nBasic requirement on the batteries is high power\nfor a short period \xe2\x80\x94 12 minutes. With a lifetime of only\n66 minutes the batteries are kept inert until just four\nseconds before Centaur separation and 20 seconds before\nsolid rocket ignition. After activation, in which an\nelectrolyte is injected into the cells, the batteries\nare at full voltage in one-half second and ready for\nuse in two seconds.\nComputer Command Subsystem\nHeart of the onboard control system is the computer command subsystem (CCS) which provides a semiautomatic capability to the spacecraft.\nThe CCS includes two independent plated wire\nmemories, each with a capacity of 4,096 data words.\nHalf of each memory stores reusable fixed routines\nwhich will not change during the mission. The second\nhalf is reprogrammable by updates from the ground.\nMost commands to other spacecraft subsystems are\nissued from the CCS memory, which, at any given time,\nis loaded with the sequences appropriate to the mission\nphase. The CCS also can decode commands from the\nground and pass them along to other spacecraft subsystems.\nUnder control of an accurate onboard clock, the\nCCS counts hours, minutes or seconds until some preprogrammed interval has elapsed and then branches\ninto subroutines stored in the memory which result\nin commands to other subsystems. A sequencing event\ncan be a single command or a routine which includes\nmany commands (e.g. manipulating the tape recorder\nduring a playback sequence).\nThe CCS can issue commands singly from one of its\ntwo processors or in a parallel or tandem state from\nboth processors. An example of CCS dual control is\nthe execution of trajectory correction maneuvers.\nTCM thrusters are started with a tandem command\n(both processors must send consistent commands to a\nsingle output unit) and stopped with a parallel command (either processor working through different\noutput units will stop the burn).\n- more -\n\n-32-\n\nThe CCS can survive any single internal fault.\nEach funtional unit has a duplicate elsewhere in the\nsubsystem.\nAttitude Control and Propulsion\nStabilization and orientation of the spacecraft\nfrom launch vehicle separation until end of the mission\nis provided by two major engineering subsystems\nattitude and articulation control (AACS) and propulsion.\nPropulsion Subsystem\nThe propulsion subsystem consists of a large solidpropellant rocket motor for final Jupiter transfer\ntrajectory velocity and a hydrazine blowdown system\nwhich fuels 16 thrusters on the mission module and\neight reaction engines on the propulsion module.\nThe single hydrazine (N9H4) supply is contained\nwithin a o.71-m (28-in.) diameter spherical titanium\ntank separated from the helium pressurization gas by a\nTeflon filled rubber bladder. The tank, located in\nthe central cavity of the mission module\'s 10-sided\nbasic structure, will contain 105 kg (231 Ib.) of hydrazine at launch and will be pressurized at 2,900,000\nnewtons/meters (420 psi). . As the propellant is\nconsumed, the helium pressure will decrease to a minimum of about 900,000 newtons/meters2 (130 psi).\nAll 24 hydrazine thrusters use a catalyst which\nspontaneously initiates and sustains rapid decomposition of the hydrazine.\nThe 16 thrusters on the mission module each deliver\n0.89 N (0.2-lb.) thrust. Four are used to execute\ntrajectory correction maneuvers; the others in two redundant six-thruster branches, to stabilize the\nspacecraft on its three axes. Only one branch of attitude control thrusters is needed at any time.\nMounted on outriggers from the propulsion module\nare four 445 N-(100-lb.) thrust engines\nwhich, during solid-motor burn, provide thrust-vector\ncontrol on the pitch and yaw axes. Four 22.2-N (5-lb-)\nthrust engines provide roll control.\n- more -\n\n-33-\n\nThe solid rocket, which weighs 1,220 kg (2,690 Ib.)\nincluding 1,060 kg (2,340 Ib.) of propellant, develops\nan average 68,000 newton (15,300 Ib.) thrust during its\n43~second burn duration.\nAttitude and Articulation Control Subsystem\nThe AACS includes an onboard computer called\nHYPACE (hybrid programmable attitude control electronics) , redundant Sun sensors, redundant Canopus star\ntrackers, three two-axis gyros and scan actuators for\npositioning the science platform.\nThe The HYPACE contains two redundant 4,096rword plated\nwire memories -- part of which are fixed and part reprogrammable \xe2\x80\x94 redundant processors and input-output\ndriver circuits. For a nominal mission, the memories\nwill be changed only to modify predetermined control\ninstructions.\nInjection Propulsion Control\nBecause of the energy required to achieve a Jupiter ballistic trajectory with an 800 kg (1750 Ib.)\npayload, the spacecraft launched by the Titan III E/\nCentaur includes a final propulsive stage which adds\na velocity increment of about 7,200 kmps (4,500 mph) .\nThe solid rocket motor in the propulsion module is\nignited 15 seconds after the spacecraft separates from\nthe Centaur and burns for about 43 seconds. Firing\ncircuits to the motor are armed during the launch vehicle countdown.\nThe four 100-Ib. thrust engines provide pitch\nand yaw attitude control and the four 5-lb.\nthrust engines provide roll control until burnout of\nthe solid rocket motor. The hydrazine engines respond\nto pulses from the AACS\'s computer. Only two pitchyaw and two roll engines at most are thrusting at any\ngiven time.\n\n- more -\n\n-34-\n\nPrior to solid rocket ignition and following burnout, only the smaller roll engines are required until\nthe propulsion module is separated from the mission\nmodule. They are so oriented on the propulsion module\nthat, by proper engine selection by the AACS, attitude\ncontrol is maintained on all three axes.\nApproximately 11 minutes after solid rocket burnout,\nthe propulsion module is jettisoned. Several seconds\nearlier, the propellant line carrying hydrazine from\nthe mission module to the propulsion module is sealed\nand separated.\nCelestial Reference Control\nThe Sun sensors, which look through a slot in the\nhigh gain antenna dish, are electro-optical devices\nthat send attitude position error signals to HYPACE,\nwhich, in turn, signals the appropriate attitude control thruster to fire and turn the spacecraft in the\nproper direction. Sun lock stabilizes the spacecraft\non two axes (pitch and yaw).\nThe star Canopus, one of the brightest in the\ngalaxy, is the second celestial reference for threeaxis stabilization. Two Canopus trackers are mounted\nso that their lines of sight are parallel. Only one\nis in use at any one time. The star tracker, through\nHYPACE logic, causes the thrusters to roll the spacecraft about the already fixed Earth or Sun pointed roll\naxis until the tracker is locked on Canopus. Brightness of the tracker\'s target star is telemetered to\nthe ground to verify the correct star has been\nacquired.\nTo enhance downlink communications capability, the\nSun sensor will be electrically biased (offset) by commands from the computer command subsystem to point the\nroll axis at or as near the Earth as possible. The Sun\nsensor can be biased plus and minus 20 degrees in both\npitch and yaw axes.\nThree axis stabilization with celestial reference\nis the normal attitude control mode for crmise phases\nbetween planets.\n\n- more -\n\n-35-\n\nInertial Reference Control\nThe spacecraft can be stabilized on one axis (roll)\nor all three axes with the AACS\'s inertial reference\nunit, consisting of three gyros.\nAppropriate inertial reference modes are used\nwhenever the spacecraft is not on Sun-star celestial\nlock. Such situations include: maintaining inertial\nreference from Centaur separation until initial celestial acquisition is achieved; purposely turning the\nspacecraft off Sun-star lock to do directed trajectory\ncorrections or science instrument mappings or calibrations; providing a reference when the Sun is occulted;\nand providing a reference when concern exists that\nthe Canopus or Sun sensor will detect stray intensity from unwanted sources \xe2\x80\x94 planets, rings, satellites,\nEach gyro has associated electronics to provide\nposition information about two orthogonal axes (Gyro A:\npitch and yaw, Gyro B: roll and pitch, Gyro C: yaw\nand roll). Normally, two gyros will be on for any inertial mode. The gyros have two selectable rates, one\n\xe2\x80\x94 high rate \xe2\x80\x94 for propulsion module injection phase;\nthe other for mission module cruise and trajectory\ncorrection and science maneuvers.\nTrajectory Correction Maneuvers\nThe Voyager trajectories are planned around eight\ntrajectory correction maneuvers (TCM) with each spacecraft between launch and Saturn encounter. Mission requirements call for extremely accurate maneuvers to\nreach the desired zones at Jupiter, Saturn and the\ntarget satellites. Total velocity increment capability\nfor each spacecraft is about 724 km/hr (450 mph) .\nThe first maneuver is planned for the period from\nlaunch plus five days to launch plus 15 days. The\nburn may take several hours, depending upon launch vehicle and injection phase trajectory errors and may\nbe done in several parts because of thermal constraints\nat this Sun-spacecraft distance. Subsequent TCMs will\nnot be so constrained. Three more maneuvers will be\nexecuted prior to closest approach to Jupiter and four\nmore between Jupiter and Saturn.\n\n- more -\n\n-36-\n\nTCM sequencing is under control of the computer\ncommand subsystem (CCS) which sends the required turn\nangles to the AACS for positioning the spacecraft at\nthe correct orientation in space and, at the proper\ntime, sends commands to the AACS to start and stop\nthe TCM burn. Attitude control is maintained by pulseoff sequencing of the TCM engines and pulse-on sequencing of two attitude control roll thrusters. Position\nand rate signals are obtained from the gyros. Following\nthe burn, reacquisition of the cruise celestial references is accomplished by unwinding the commanded\nturns \xe2\x80\x94 repeating the turn sequence in reverse order.\nAll TCMs are enabled by ground command.\nScience Platform (Articulation Control)\nVoyager\'s two television cameras, ultraviolet\nspectrometer, photopolarimeter and infrared spectrometer and radiometer are mounted on a scan platform\nwhich can be rotated about two axes for precise pointing at Jupiter, Saturn and their satellites during the\nplanetary phases of the flight. The platform is located at the end of the science boom. Total gimballed\nweight is 107 kg (236 lb.).\nControlled by the attitude and articulation control subsystem (AACS), the platform allows multiple\npointing directions of the instruments. Driver circuits\nfor the scan actuators -- one for each axis -- are located in the AACS computer. The platform\'s two axes\nof rotation are described as the azimuth angle motion\nabout an axis displaced 7 degrees from the spacecraft\nroll axis (perpendicular to the boom centerline)\nand elevation angle motion about an axis perpendicular to the azimuth axis and rotating with the azimuth\naxis. Anglar range is 360 degrees in azimuth and 210\ndegrees in elevation.\nThe platform is slewed one axis at a time with\nselectable slew rates in response to computer command\nsubsystem commands to the AACS. Slew rates are: high\nrate, 1 degree per second; medium rate; .33 degree\n/s; low rate; .083 degrees/s; and a special UVS low\nrate; .0052 degree/s\nCamera line of sight will be\ncontrolled to within 2.5 milliradians.\n\n- more -\n\n-37-\n\nTemperature Control\nThe two Voyager spacecraft are designed to operate\nfarther from Earth than any previous man made object.\nSurvival depends greatly upon keeping temperatures\nwithin operating limits while the spacecraft traverses\nan environmental range of one solar constant at the\nEarth distance to four per cent of that solar intensity at Jupiter and less than one per cent at Saturn.\nUnprotected surfaces at the Saturn range, nearly\none billion miles from the Sun can reach 196 C\n(321 F) below zero \xe2\x80\x94 the temperature of liquid nitrogen.\nBoth top and bottom of the mission module\'s basic\ndecagon structure are enclosed with multi-layer thermal\nblankets to prevent the rapid loss of heat to the cold\nof space. The blankets are sandwiches of aluminized\nMylar, sheets of Tedlar for micrometeroid protection\nand outer black Kapton covers which are electrically\nconductive to prevent the accumulation of electrostatic charges.\nAlso extensively blanketed are the instruments on\nthe scan platform. Smaller blankets and thermal wrap\ncover eight electronics bays, boom and body-mounted instruments, cabling, propellant lines and structural\nstruts. Only a few exterior elements of the spacecraft\nare not clad in the black film \xe2\x80\x94 the high gain antenna\nreflector, plasma sensors, sun sensors and antenna\nfeed cones.\nTemperature control of four of the 10 electronics\ncompartments is provided by thermostatically-controlled\nlouver assemblies which provide an internal operating\nrange near room temperature. The louvers are rotated\nopen by bimetallic springs when large amounts of heat\nare dissipated. These bays contain the power conditioning equipment, the radio power amplifiers, the\nHYPACE and the tape recorder. Mini-louvers are located on the scan platform, cosmic ray instrument and\nand the Sun sensors.\n- more -\n\n-38-\n\nRadiodisotope heating units (RHU), small nonpower-using heater elements which generate one watt\nof thermal energy, are located on the magnetometer sensors and the Sun sensors. No RHUs are used near instruments which detect charged particles.\nElectric heaters are located throughout the spacecraft to provide additional heat during certain portions\nof the mission. Many of the heaters are turned off\nwhen their respective valves, instruments or subassemblies are on and dissipating power.\n\n-more-\n\n-39-\n\nMISSION PROFILE\n\nTrajectories for the Voyager flights were chosen\nnot only to give scientists close up looks at the planets\nbut at many important satellites. In fact, Voyager is\na mission to more than 15 major bodies in the solar\nsystem.\nAccording to the mission plan, Voyaqer 2 will be\nlaunched first. Voyager 1 will fly a faster trajectory\nand will overtake Voyager 2 before they reach Jupiter.\nVoyager 1 will arrive at Jupiter four months ahead of\nVoyager 2 and will be nine months out in front by the\ntime it reaches Saturn.\nEach Voyager uses 10 instruments and the spacecraft radio to perform 11 investigations. They will\nstudy the two planets, Saturn\'s rings, at least 11 of\ntheir satellites and interplanetary space.\nThe trajectory for each spacecraft is unique.\nComputer simulations of many possible flight paths were\nused for analysis. The final choice will afford\nmaximum coverage of both planets and their major\nsatellites. The spacecraft will make equatorial passes\nat Jupiter and use the giant planet\'s gravity to boost\nthem toward Saturn. The Voyagers -will get good views\nof Saturn\'s polar region, a close fly-by of Titan and\nwill study several of its other satellites at close\nrange. An option exists for the later arriving Voyager -if everything has gone well and the spacecraft is still\nhealthy \xe2\x80\x94 to fly on to Uranus.\nScientific operations begin soon after launch, when\nobservations of the Earth and Moon will be made. Fields\nand particles measurements will also commence shortly\nafter launch.\nIn addition to monitoring the solar wind and related\nphenomena constantly, each spacecraft will, about every\n50 million miles, spin slowly to calibrate instruments\nand take optical measurements in all directions.\n\n-more-\n\nThis illustration shows the Voyager flights to Jupiter\nand Saturn (the second craft to arrive at Saturn may go\non to Uranus). The 795-kg (1,753-lb.) spacecraft will\nstudy the giant planets and many of their moons, as well\nas interplanetary space during the flights which could\nlast nine years. Major feature of the Voyager is its\n3.66-m (12-ft.) dish antenna for Earth communications.\n\n-41-\n\nThe first Voyager will approach within 80 million\nkm (50 million mi.) of Jupiter on Dec. 15,\n1978. At that distance, Jupiter\'s disc will be large\nenough so the narrow-angle television camera can begin\nits "observatory phase" 80 days before closest approach.\nThe camera will take hundreds of color images of\nthe planet. They will be recorded on the spacecraft\'s tape recorder and transmitted to Earth daily.\nUltraviolet, infrared and polarimetry observations of\nthe visible disc of Jupiter are planned. Magneticfield, plasma-wave and radio astronomy experiments will\nmake continuous observations of Jupiter and space\naround it. Charged-particle sensors \xe2\x80\x94 from the plasma\ndetector at the low end of the energy spectrum to the\ncosmic-ray counter at the high-energy end \xe2\x80\x94 will\nobserve solar phenomena as they search for the boundary\nof Jupiter\'s magnetosphere.\nOn Feb. 5, 1979, when Voyager 1 is 30 days and 30\nmillion km (18.6 million mi.) from Jupiter, the planet\nwill have grown to 2 1/2 times the size it appeared in\nDecember. Scanning instruments will produce more\npictures, spectra and other measurements. Scientists\nconcerned with Jupiter\'s atmosphere will select features\nof special interest \xe2\x80\x94 such as the Great Red Spot and\ntransient storms. Those interested in Jupiter\'s\nsatellites will prepare for lo.ng-range and close-up\nstudies. Scientists who study the magnetosphere,\nplasma interaction and charged particles around Jupiter\nwill watch for Voyager to cross the boundary between\ninterplanetary space and Jupiter\'s domain, expected\nabout 10 days before closest approach.\nEighteen days before closest approach, Jupiter\nwill loom too large for the narrow-angle camera to\ncover in the available time. It will surrender survey\nduties to the wide-angle instrument. The narrow-angle\ncamera will follow selected features. Spectrometers\nwill scan the atmosphere and cloud tops to help\ndetermine the composition and nature of the brilliant\nbands.\n\n-more-\n\n-42-\n\nVOYAGER FLIGHT PATHS\nURANUS\n8/20/77\nSATURN\n8/27/81\n\nSATURN\n11/13/80\n\nJUPITER\nSATURN\nTITAN\n\nSATURN\n8/20/77\nJUPITER\n7/9/79\n3/5/79\n\nURANUS\n1/30/86\n\nJUPITERSATURN- EARTH\nURANUS 8/20/77\nMARS\n8/20/77\n\nJUPITER\n8/20/77\n\n-43-\n\nNear encounter will occur during the first days\nof March 1979 (page 44).\nActivity will reach a peak\non-board the spacecraft and at the Mission Control\nCenter at Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Shortly before\nclosest approach to Jupiter \xe2\x80\x94 at 4 a.m. (PST),\nMarch 5, 1979 \xe2\x80\x94 Mariner will fly within 415,000 km\n(258,000 mi.) of Amalthea, innermost of Jupiter\'s\nmany satellites, giving scientists their first close\nlook at the tiny object.\nThe spacecraft will flash past Jupiter about\n278,000 km (173,000 mi.) from the surface of the planet.\nThen, for almost two hours, controllers will lose\ncontact with Voyager 1 as it is occulted by Jupiter\nwhile its on-board computer directs the flight, the\ndata collection by its instruments and recording for\nlater playback to Earth. Following this closest\napproach to Jupiter and just before the spacecraft\nenters Jupiter\'s shadow, the spacecraft will examine\nlo from 22,000 km (13,700 mi.). As the spacecraft\npasses lo it will fly through the "flux-tube," a\nregion of magnetic and plasma interaction between Jupiter\nand lo. Disappearance of the spacecraft behind Jupiter\nwill allow scientists to study the upper atmosphere of\nthe planet as sunlight and the dual-frequency (S-band\nand X-band) radio links cut off and then reappear.\nAfter passing Jupiter, Voyager 1 will examine\nthree more of the four big Galilean satellites:\nEuropa from 733,000 km (455,000 mi.); Ganymede from\n115,000 km (71,500 mi.); and Callisto from 124,000 km\n(77,000 mi.).\nJupiter\'s gravity will slingshot Voyager toward\nSaturn, 750 million km (466 million mi.) farther from\nthe Sun. Voyager will continue to study Jupiter and\nits satellites until early April, about a month after\nclosest approach.\nPlanetary operations with the second spacecraft\nwill begin about April 20, 1979. Its observatory\nphase will continue earlier measurements for a look\nat the planet that covers more than eight months.\n\n-more-\n\n-44-\n\nTYPICAL VOYAGER FLYBYS OF JUPITER AND SATURN\nLAUNCH DATE \xe2\x80\xa2 9/1/77\nSATURN ARRIVAL DATE \'\n\nLAUNCH DATE \xe2\x80\xa2 9/1/77\nJUPITER ARRIVAL DATE =3/5/79\nEARTH\nOCCULTATION\nZONE\n\nSUN\nOCCULTATION\nZONE\n\nMIMAS\n100,000 KM\n162,100 Ml)\n\n10\n25,000 KM\n\n(15,500 Ml)\n\nDIONE\n140,000 KM\n(87,000 Ml)\n\nGANYMEDE\n130,000 KM\n(80,000 Ml)\nCALLISTO\n130,000 KM\n(80,000 Ml)\n\nAMALTHEA\n440,000 KM\n(273,400 Ml)\n\nflTAN\n7,000 KM\n(4,350 Ml J\n\nSUN\nOCCULTATION\nZONE\n\nTETHYS\n410,000 KM\n(254,8000 Ml)\n\nEARTH\nOCCULTATION\nZONE\nRHEA\n60,000 KM\n\nEUROPA\n750,000 KM\n(466,000 Ml)\n\n-EARTH OCCULTATION\n\n11/13/80\n\n(37,300 Ml)\n\nLAUNCH DATE = 8/20/77\nJUPITER ARRIVAL DATE\n\nLAUNCH DATE = 8/20/77\nSATURN ARRIVAL DATE\n7/9/79\n\nSUN OCCULTATION\n\nENCELADUS\n90,000 KM\n(55,900 Ml)\n\nAMALTHEA\n550,000 KM\n(341,800 Ml)\nDIONE\n200,000 KM\n(124,300 Ml)\nEUROPA\n190,000 KM\n(118,000 Ml)\n\nEARTH\nOCCULTATION\nZONE\n\nOCCULTATION\nZONE\nGANYMEDE\n50,000 KM\n(310,000 Ml)\n\nENCELADUS\n230,000 KM\n(142,900 Ml)\n\nCALLISTO\n240,000 KM\n(149,000 Ml)\n\n8/27/81\n\nTITAN\n350,000 KM\n(217,500 Ml)\nRHEA\n\n250,000 KM\n(155,300 Ml)\nTETHYS\n160,000 KM\n(99,400 Ml)\nMIMAS\n,000 KM\n(18,600 Ml)\n\n-45-\n\nTo avoid radiation hazards close to Jupiter, the\nsecond Voyager will fly about 9 Jupiter radii (643,000\nkm or 400,000 mi.) from the visible cloud surface. It\nwill not repeat the close flyby of lo. It will survey\nCallisto from 220,000 km (137,000 mi.) and Ganymede\nfrom 55,000 km (34,000 mi.). It will fly within\n201,000 km (125,000 mi.) of Europa and will take a\nquick look at Amalthea. Closest approach to Jupiter\nwill take place July 10, 1979. The remainder of the\nmonth and the first week in August will be taken up\nwith outbound observations.\nAbout a year after the Jupiter phase of the mission\nends, Voyager 1 will begin its studies of Saturn \xe2\x80\x94\nAug. 24, 1980.\nThe image of the ringed planet will grow in the\nnarrow-angle camera\'s field of view through the fall\nof 1980. By late October, the rings will be too big to\nbe captured in a single frame and it will be necessary\nto mosaic multiple frames. No one knows how extensive\nSaturn\'s magnetosphere is, so the particles and fields\ninstruments will begin continuous high-rate data\nacquisition a month before the Nov. 12 closest\napproach.\nPlans for the first Voyager call for a flyby\nwithin 4,000 km (2,500 mi.) of the southern regions\nof the major satellite Titan, whose diameter is about\n5,800 km (3,600 mi.) and whose mass is about double\nthat of Earth\'s moon. The spacecraft will fly past\nTethys about an hour and a half before it reaches\nSaturn and then will be occulted both from Earth and\nthe Sun.\nVoyager 1 will fly past Saturn\'s southern hemisphere, about 138,000 km (85,800 mi.) from the center\nof the planet. Wide-angle and narrow-angle cameras and\nphotometric, ultraviolet and infrared instruments will\nstudy Saturn and its rings intensively. The magnetosphere and accompanying regions of trapped charged\nparticles will be charted along the spacecraft\'s path.\n\n-more-\n\n-46-\n\nVoyager will lose contact with Earth for a\nshort time \xe2\x80\x94 as it did at Jupiter \xe2\x80\x94 when it passes\nbehind Saturn and the rings. Careful measurement of\nthe radio tracking signals will provide a physical\nprofile deep into the atmosphere and will help\nscientists explain the nature and structure of the\nrings.\nAs the spacecraft flies away from Saturn,\nsurveys of the satellites Enceladus and Rhea are\nplanned and its scan platform will look back at the\nlighted crescent and tilted rings of Saturn, collecting\nlong-range information for another month.\nSix months after the end of the first Saturn\nencounter, on June 8, 1981, Voyager 2 will move into\nrange. NASA has left options open for the flyby.\nThere are two choices: If all has gone well, with a\nsuccessful first encounter of Saturn and a healthy\nsecond spacecraft, a trajectory may be picked that\nwill boost the second spacecraft toward the planet\nUranus. The plan calls for a fairly close pass at\nSaturn, crossing the plane of the rings about 38,000\nkm (23,600 mi.) beyond the visible outer edge, giving\nup a repeat of the close Titan pass. Instead, Titan\nwill come within 353,000 km (219,000 mi.); Rhea\n254,000 km (150,000 mi.); Tethys 159,000 km (99,000\nmi.); Mimas and Enceladus less than 100,000 km (62,000\nmi.); and Dione 196,000 km (122,000 mi.).\nAnother option is to target for a close encounter\nwith Titan on a similar trajectory as the first\nspacecraft.\nClosest approach to Saturn will occur at 8:50\na.m. (EDT), Aug. 27, 1981. Voyager will finish its\nobservation sequence by the end of September. The\ntwo spacecraft will have completed thorough examinations\nof the two planets and their satellite systems. The\nquantity of planetary data will exceed that from\nMariner 9 in its 11-month survey of Mars in 1970-71, to\nwhich may be added several years\' worth of fields and particles\nmeasurements in the outer solar system. The atmospheres\nand magnetospheres of the planets will have been\nanalyzed and charted, and five Jovian and six or seven\nSaturnian satellites surveyed in varying detail.\n\n-more-\n\n-47-\n\nIf the Uranus option is exercised, Voyager will\nreach the seventh planet from the Sun by Jan. 30, 1986.\nUranus is markedly different from the other gas\ngiants. It is tilted so far on its axis that the poles\nalign almost with the plane of the ecliptic. In\nrelation to the other planets, Uranus rolls along on\nits side. Every 84 years the Sun shines directly on\nthe north pole; 42 years later the northern hemisphere\nis dark and the southern pole points sunward. In\n1986 the orientation will allow the spacecraft to fly\nalmost vertically through the equatorial and satellite\nplane. This geometry gives an excellent profile of\nany magnetosphere and plasma cloud that may be present\nand an examination of the sunlit hemispheres of Uranus\nand several of its satellites including its largest,\nMiranda. Voyager 2 can then fly out through the planet\'s\nwake, looking back at the southern hemisphere.\n\n-more-\n\n-48-\n\nJUPITER\nEverything about Jupiter is enormous: when the\nsolar system formed, most of the material that did not\nend up in the Sun went to make Jupiter. It is larger\nthan the rest of the planets combined.\nJupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun.\ncompletes one orbit every 11.86 Earth years.\n\nIt\n\nA day on Jupiter is complete in 9 hours, 55\nminutes and 30 seconds. This extremely rapid rotation\ncauses the planet to be flattened at the poles.\nEquatorial radius is 71,600 km (44,500 mi.), and the\npolar radius is 67,000 km (42,000 mi.).\nJupiter has 13 known satellites. A 14th may have\nbeen seen recently by Charles T. Kowal of Caltech, who\nalso found the 13th in 1974. The four largest satellites\nwere discovered by the first man to aim a telescope\nat Jupiter \xe2\x80\x94 Galileo Galilei in 1609-10. Galileo\'s\ndiscovery that Jupiter has satellites provided evidence\nthat the Copernican theory of the solar system was\ncorrect and that Earth is not the center. The four\nsatellites discovered by Galileo (grouped together and\ncalled the Galilean satellites) are lo, Europa,\nGanymede and Callisto. They range in size from the\nplanet Mercury to the Moon. All will be studied by\nthe Voyagers.\nJupiter is composed primarily of hydrogen.\nIndeed it is so massive that very little of its original\nmaterial could have escaped in the 4.6 billion years or\nso since it formed. The second most abundant element\nin Jupiter is helium. The ratio of hydrogen to helium\non Jupiter probably is about the same as in the Sun.\nThe solar ratio is roughly one atom of helium for 10\nmolecules of hydrogen.\nSeveral other substances have been identified\nspectroscopically in the Jovian atmosphere: ammonia,\nmethane, water, ethane and acetylene.\nThe presence of\nhydrogen sulfide has been inferred. These are minor\ncomponents, relative to hydrogen and helium.\n\n-more-\n\nEarth and Jupiter to scale.\n\n-50-\n\nThe currently popular model of Jupiter\'s structure\nbegins with a small iron silicate core only a few\nthousand kilometers in diameter. The core is inferred\nbecause cosmic abundances of the elements include\nsmall amounts of iron and silicates. The temperature\nthere is thought to be about 30,000 degrees Kelvin\n(54,000 degrees Fahrenheit).\nSurrounding the suspected core is a thick layer\nin which hydrogen is the most abundant element. The\nhydrogen is separated into two layers, both liquid\nbut in different states. The inner layer, about\n46,000 km (29,000 mi.) radius, is liquid metallic\nhydrogen, which means that the hydrogen is electrically\nconductive like ordinary metals. That form of hydrogen\nhas not been observed in laboratories since it requires\nimmense heat and pressure. On Jupiter it is thought\nto exist at temperatures around 11,000 degrees Kelvin\n(20,000 degrees Fahrenheit) and at pressures about 3\nmillion times Earth\'s sea-level atmosphere.\nThe next layer \xe2\x80\x94 liquid hydrogen in its molecular form -- extends to about 70,000 km (44,000 mi.).\nAbove that layer, reaching to the cloud tops for\nanother 1,000 km (600 mi.) is the atmosphere.\nIf the model is correct, Jupiter has no solid\nsurface, but exists as a rapidly spinning ball of gas\nand liquid almost 779 million km (484 million mi.)\nfrom the Sun.\nOne of the puzzles about Jupiter is the fact that\nit radiates about two and a half times the amount of\nheat that it receives from the Sun. Early models\npostulated nuclear reactions inside the planet or\nheat from gravitational contraction. These ideas are\nno longer believed likely.\nSince a liquid is virtually incompressible,\nhowever, and since Jupiter is too small and too cold\nto generate nuclear reactions, scientists now believe\nthe excess heat being radiated by the planet is left\nover from the primordial heat generated when the\nplanet coalesced out of the solar nebula. As NASA\'s\nDr. John Wolfe writes, "Jupiter cannot be radiating\nheat because it is contracting; on the contrary, it\nis contracting because it is slowly cooling."\n\n-more-\n\n-51-\n\nThe visible surface of Jupiter consists of bands\nof clouds, alternating dark and light, from the\nequator to about 50 degrees latitude, as shown on page\n52 . These bands appear to be convection cells that\nare stretched by Coriolis forces created by the\nplanet\'s rapid rotation. By convention, the light\nfeatures are called zones and the dark ones belts.\nThe light zones appear to be regions of greater\naltitude and cooler temperatures than the dark belts.\nGas warmed by the planet\'s internal heat rises and\ncools in the upper atmosphere and forms clouds of\nammonia crystals suspended in gaseous hydrogen. At\nthe top of the zones, the cooler material moves toward\nthe equator or the poles, is deflected in an eastwest direction by Coriolis forces and then sinks\nback to lower altitudes. A similar but much smaller\nmechanism on Earth causes the trade winds.\nOne of the most prominent features on Jupiter is\nthe Great Red Spot. It has been observed almost\nconstantly since its discovery 300 years ago by\nGiovanni Domenico Cassini. Its width is almost\nalways about 14,000 km (9,000 mi.), but its length\nvaries between 30,000 km (19,000 mi.) and 40,000 km\n(25,000 mi.).\nThe Great Red Spot appears to resemble an immense\nhurricane on Earth \xe2\x80\x94 although it is much larger and\nhas lasted much longer than any terrestrial storms.\nOther spots have been observed in the Jovian\natmosphere that are similar to but much smaller than\nthe Great Red Spot. They, too, appear in the\nequatorial regions but have relatively short lifetimes.\nThe one most recently observed lasted just under\ntwo years.\nAbove about 50 degrees latitude f the bands\ndisappear and the Jovian atmosphere becomes turbulent\nand disorganized.\nIt appears to contain many small\nconvection cells such as those that create the belts\nand zones of the lower latitudes.\n\n-more-\n\nMAJOR FEATURES OF JUPITER\n\nNORTH NORTH NORTH\nTEMPERATE BELT\n\nNORTH POLAR\nREGION\n\nNORTH NORTH\nTEMPERATE BELT\n\nNORTH NORTH\nTEMPERATE ZONE\n\nNORTH TEMPERATE\nBELT\n\nNORTH TEMPERATE\nZONE\n\nNORTH EQUATORIAL\nBELT\n\nNORTH TROPICAL\nZONE\n\nN.

The emissions are confined to two\nregions of the spectrum \xe2\x80\x94 with wavelengths measured\nin tens of meters (decametric) and in tenths of meters\n(decimetric). The decimetric contribution comes\nprimarily from nonthermal mechanisms that depend on\nthe planet\'s magnetic field. This "synchrotron\nradiation" comes from electrons that move near the\nspeed of light.\nThe satellite Io appears to have some link with\nthe decametric radiation, since the bursts seem to\noccur when Io crosses the face of Jupiter.\nWhile the Jovian magnetic field is essentially\ndipolar (north and south, like Earth\'s), its direction\nis opposite Earth\'s (the needle of a compass on\nJupiter would point south). The axis of the field is\noffset about 10.8 degrees from the rotational axis\nand the center of the axis is offset from the center of\nthe planet by about one tenth of a Jupiter radius. At\nthe planet\'s cloud tops the field ranges between three\nand 14 gauss (Earth\'s magnetic field at the surface\naverages about one half gauss).\nThe shape of Jupiter\'s magnetic field is about\nthe same as Earth\'s with some significant differences.\nThe movement of energetic particles near the equator\nis intense, but at higher latitudes falls off\ndramatically. There is apparently an electric-current\nsheet along the magnetic equator that traps and holds\nparticles there.\nThe five inner satellites of Jupiter affect\ndistribution of charged particles. As the satellites\norbit Jupiter they sweep particles out of their way\nand at the same time their surfaces are altered by\nthe impinging particles.\nJupiter\'s outer magnetosphere is highly variable\nin size, possibly due to changes in the solar-wind\npressure. Both Pioneer spacecraft flew in and out of\nthe magnetosphere several times on their inbound legs.\nThe first crossed the magnetopause -\xe2\x80\x94 outer edge of the\nregion \xe2\x80\x94 at about 100 Jupiter radii (RT) and crossed\nagain as close as 50 R . Earth\'s magnetosphere would\nshrink that much only in the event of the largest\nsolar magnetic storms.\n\n-more-\n\n-54-\n\nHigh-energy electrons have also been observed in\nanother unexpected place \xe2\x80\x94 ahead of the bow shock\nwave in interplanetary space. Scientists believe highenergy particles in Jupiter\'s magnetosphere reach such\nvelocity that they can escape. Reexamination of\nrecords from Earth satellites turned up the fact that\nthese electrons had been observed for many years.\nThey were believed, however, to be of cosmic origin.\nNow scientists think they spin down the solar magnetic\nfield lines and intersect Earth, since their peaks\noccur every 13 months when Earth and Jupiter are\nconnected by the spiral lines of the interplanetary\nmagnetic field.\nJupiter\'s satellites fall into three groups \xe2\x80\x94\nthe large inner bodies, then a group of four that are\nsmall and a final group, also four in number, that are\nfar distant and have retrograde orbits.\nThe five inner satellites are Amalthea (the\nsmallest, about 240 km or 150 mi. in diameter);\nlo, larger than Mercury; Europa, Ganymede and Callisto.\nlo is about 3,640 km (2,260 mi.) in diameter. It\ndisplays some of the most bizarre phenomena in the\nsolar system. The density of lo is about the same as\nthat of the Moon, indicating a rocky composition. lo\nhas a layer of ionized particles about 100 km (60 mi.)\nabove the surface; the satellite has a tenuous atmosphere.\nMeasurements indicate the atmosphere is about one\nbillionth as dense as Earth\'s. lo is surrounded by\na yellow glow \xe2\x80\x94 an ionized cloud of sodium. Also\ndetected in this tenuous extended atmosphere are\nhydrogen, potassium and sulfur. The surface of this\nJovian moon has a unique spectrum, probably due to a\ncombination of sulfur and salts deposited long ago\nthrough hydrothermal outgassing. lo also has reddish\npolar caps of unknown composition.\nEuropa, smaller than lo, has a diameter of 3,050\nkm (1,900 mi.). Europa appears to be a rocky body\nlike lo and scientists say this is probably because\nit heated early in its history to a temperature high\nenough to drive off the volatiles. However, its white\nhighly reflective surface is almost entirely covered\nwith ice and frost.\n\n-more-\n\n-55-\n\nGanymede is one of the largest satellites in the\nsolar system. Its diameter is 5,270 km (3,270 mi.).\nGanymede may be mostly liquid water -- a planet-sized\ndrop of water with a mud core and a crust of ice. The\nsurface is not pure ice, however. It is mixed with\ndarker material of unknown composition.\nCallisto has a diameter of 5,000 km (3,110 mi.).\nIt is darker than the other Galilean satellites,\napparently because of absence of ice or light-colored\nsalts. It may have suffered the least change of all\nthe big satellites since formation billions of years\nago. Scientists believe it is probably half water and\nmay contain so little rock that radioactive heating\nhas not melted or differentiated it.\nThe outer satellites, in order of increasing\ndistance from Jupiter, are: Leda, Himalia, Lysithea,\nElara, Ananke, Carme, Gasiphae and Sinope. All the\nouter satellites appear to be very different from the\ninner group. They may be former asteroids captured by\nJupiter. Or they may be the remains of broken-up\nsatellites. Their orbits are fairly highly inclined\n(25 to 28 degrees from the equatorial plane) and the\noutermost four pursue retrograde paths.\n\n-more-\n\n-56-\n\nSATURN\n\nSaturn is the farthest planet from the Sun known\nto the ancients. uot until Sir William Herschel discovered Uranus in 1781 did anyone know of the existence\nof a trans-Saturnian planet.\nSaturn is unique in the solar system. It is the\nonly planet less dense than water and, until the\nrecent discovery of Uranus\' rings, was thought to be\nthe only planet with rings.\nThe rings were discovered in 1610 when Galileo\nGalilei aimed the first astronomical telescope at\nSaturn. Even Galileo diun\'t realize what they were.\nHe reported seeing "cup handles" in his less-thanadequate telescope. Forty-five years later, in 1655,\nChristian Huygens described the rings\' true form.\nSaturn has a volume 815 times greater than Earth\'s,\nbut a mass only 95.2 times greater. It is the second\nlargest planet. Saturn\'s equatorial radius is 60,000\nkm (37,300 mi.). The polar radius is considerably\nsmaller \xe2\x80\x94 53,500 km (33,430 mi.). The dynamic\nflattening, caused by Saturn\'s rapid rotation and increased by its low density, is the greatest of any\nplanet yet measured.\nA day on Saturn\'s equator is only 10 hours, 14\nminutes -- 18.5 minutes longer than a day on Jupiter.\nSaturn completes one orbit of the Sun in 29.46 Earth\nyears. The average distance of Saturn from the Sun\nis 9.5 A.U.* Saturn receives only about l/100th\nthe Sun\'s intensity that strikes Earth.\nSaturn, like the other outer giants, bears some\nresemblance to Jupiter -- enough that they are often\ncoupled together as the Jovian planets. Like Jupiter,\nSaturn apparently has no solid surface, but changes\ngradually from a thin outer atmosphere through\nprogressively denser layers to the core, which may be\na small chunk of iron and rock.\n*An astronomical unit (A.U.) is the mean distance\nfrom the Sun to the Earth \xe2\x80\x94 149,600,000 km (92,960,000\nmi.) .\n-more-\n\nEarth and Saturn to scale.\n\n-58-\n\nWhen scientists discuss the planet\'s atmosphere,\nthey generally restrict their attention to a region\nwhere pressure varies from 1,000,Earth atmospheres to\none 10-billionth atmosphere (10\n).\nLike Jupiter, the principal constituents of the\nSaturnian atmosphere are thought to be hydrogen and\nhelium. Three molecules have definitely been detected\nin Saturn\'s atmosphere: hydrogen (H ), methane (CH.)\nand ethane (C-H,.) . Radio observations provide indirect\nevidence for ammonia (NH_) at atmospheric levels inaccessible to optical measurements. No other\nmolecular or atomic species has been detected.\nAlso, like Jupiter, Saturn is believed to be\ncomposed of materials in about the same ratio as the\nSun, formed into the simplest molecules expected in\na hydrogen rich atmosphere.\nSaturn appears to radiate nearly twice as much\nenergy as it receives from the Sun. In the case of\nJupiter, that radiation has been explained as primordial\nheat left over from the time, about 4.6 billion years\nago, when the planet coalesced out of the solar\nnebula. The same may be true for Saturn. Convection\nis the most likely transport mechanism to carry heat\nfrom the interior of the planet to the surface.\nSaturn has cloud bands similar to Jupiter\'s,\nalthough they are harder to see and contrast less with\nthe planetary disc. Photographs confirm that Saturn\'s\nbland appearance is real. The blandness may be a\nresult of lower temperatures and reduced chemical\nand meteorological activity compared with Jupiter or\na relatively permanent and uniform high altitude haze.\nThe principal features of Saturn\'s visible surface\nare stripes that parallel the equator, as shown on\npage 60.\nSix dark belts and three light zones have\nbeen seen continuously over 200 years of observations.\n\n-more-\n\n-59-\n\nSpots have been observed in the upper atmosphere\nof Saturn. Unlike the Great Red Spot of Jupiter they\nare not permanent nor are they easily identifiable.\nThe spots that have been observed have lifetimes up\nto a few months. Sometimes they are light/ sometimes\ndark. They are confined to a region within 60 degrees\nof the equator and typically are a few thousand\nkilometers across. They may be comparable to hurricanes\non Earth.\nSaturn has 10 known satellites. The most recent\ndiscovery was Janus, found in 1966 by Audouin Dollfus.\nJanus has been seen in only a few photographs. It\nappears to travel in the plane of Saturn\'s rings and\nnear them. Its low albedo and proximity to the rings\nmake Janus difficult to observe except when the rings\nare edge-on to Earth and recent studies indicate\nthat at least two separate satellites are masquerading\nunder the name of Janus.\nThe largest known satellite in the solar system\nis Saturn\'s satellite Titan. Titan has a diameter of\n5,800 km (3,600 mi.) and is known to have an atmosphere.\nIn 1944, the late Dr. Gerard Kuiper detected a methane\natmosphere on Titan. Titan\'s atmospheric pressure\nmay be comparable to Earth\'s. Other molecules identified\ninclude ethane and probably acetylene and many\nscientists believe there is also a major undetected\ngas present. The most likely candidate is nitrogen.\nSome scientists believe organic compounds may be\npresent on the surface of Titan, leading some to\nsuggest it as a possible abode of some primitive life\nforms.\nlapetus is another Saturnian satellite that\ndraws scientific interest. Its brightness varies\nby a factor of about five as it rotates on its axes,\nindicating that one face is bright and the other\ndark. The light face appears to be covered with ice\nbut the composition of the dark face is unknown.\nSaturn\'s rings have been a curiosity to\nastronomers since their discovery. Their origin is\nunknown but a number of hypotheses have been put\nforward. They might be the remains of some early\nsatellite broken up by gravitation or remnants of the\nprimordial material that somehow became trapped in\norbit. The age of the rings is not known.\n\n-more-\n\nMAJOR FEATURES OF SATURN\nNORTH\nEQUATORIAL BELT\nCREPE RING\nMIDDLE RING\n\nNORTH POLAR REGION\nNORTH NORTH\nTEMPERATE BELT\nNORTH\nTEMPERATE BELT\n\nOUTER RING\nO\nI\n\nSOUTH TEMPERATE BELT\nSOUTH EQUATORIAL BELT\n\nSOUTH SOUTH\nTEMPERATE BELT\n\nSOUTH POLAR REGION\n\n-61The rings lie in Saturn\'s equatorial plane, which\nis tipped 27 degrees to the orbital plane of Saturn.\nAlthough it is certain the rings are not a solid\nsheet, little else is known about their composition and\nstructure. Spectroscopy shows that they are made\nprimarily of water ice or ice-covered silicates.\nThe individual particles probably vary from less\nthan a millimeter to more than 10 meters, but most\nare a few centimeters in size -- about as big as a\nsnowball.\nThree distinct rings can be seen. The inner\nor "crepe" ring begins about 17,000 kilometers\n(10,000 miles) from the planet\'s visible cloud\nsurface and extends for 15,000 km (10,000 mi.)\nto 32,000 km 20,000 mi.). The second ring\nbegins at that point and extends for 26,000 km\n(16,000 mi.) to a distance of 58,000 km (36,000\nmi.) from the planet. There, a phenomenon\nknown as Cassini\'s Division breaks the rings\'\ncontinuity. Cassini\'s Division is 2,600 km\n(1,600 mi.) wide.\nThe outer ring begins 60,000 km (38,000 mi.)\nfrom the equator of Saturn and appears to end 16,000\nkm (10,000 mi.) farther away at a distance of 76,000\nkm (48,000 mi. ) .\nCassini\'s Division is real. It is explained by\na phenomenon in celestial mechanics. Any particle\nat that distance would have an orbital period of 11\nhours, 17 1/2 minutes, just half the period of the\nsatellite Mimas. The particle would be nearest Mimas\nat the same place in its orbit every second time around.\nThis repeated gravitational perturbation would\neventually move the particle to a different distance.\nAccurate measurements of the ring thickness are\nnot possible but limits have been placed. They\nappear to be somewhere between 1 and 4 km (0.6\nto 2.5 mi.).\nUntil recently there was no evidence that Saturn\nhas a magnetic field. Neither decimetric nor decametric\nradio emissions had been observed -- the kind of "radio\nnoise" from Jupiter that was evidence for its magnetic\nfield. But radiometric observations from the Earthorbiting satellite IMP-6 have provided indirect evidence\nfor a magnetic field. If a magnetic field is present,\nit is probably distorted by the rings. Direct measurement of any magnetic field and associated trapped\nradiation is one of the primary goals of the Voyager\nmission.\n-more-\n\n-62-\n\nPLANETARY ATMOSPHERIC AND SURFACE DATA\nJupiter\nMajor atmospheric constituents are hydrogen and\nhelium.\nMinor constituents include methane, ammonia,\nacetylene, ethane and phosphoric acid.\nHydrogen has been detected in the exosphere.\nThere is a thin layer of ammonia clouds with\ntops at about 106 degrees K (-269 degrees F)\nand about 0.2 atmospheres and base at about\n150 degrees K (-189 degrees F) and about 0.6\natmospheres.\nPressure near the main cloud tops is\'about\n1.5 atmospheres.\nMain cloud top temperature is about 200\ndegrees K (-99 degrees F).\nBeneath the clouds, temperatures and pressures\nrise rapidly.\nIt is not known whether Jupiter has a solid\nsurface.\nSaturn\nMajor atmospheric constituents are hydrogen\nand perhaps helium.\nMinor constituents include methane and ammonia.\nTemperature at tropopause is about 77 degrees K\n(-321 degrees F).\nPressure at tropopause is about 0.17 atmospheres.\nIt is not known whether Saturn has a solid surface.\nEffective temperature is about 97 degrees K\n(-285 degrees F).\nBeneath the clouds, temperatures and pressures\nrise rapidly.\n\n-rnore-\n\n-63-\n\nUranus\nMajor atmospheric constituents are hydrogen\nand perhaps helium.\nMinor constituent is methane.\nEffective temperature is 57 degrees K (-356\ndegrees F).\nThe atmosphere is very deep and higher temperature\nand high pressures certainly exist at depths.\n\n-more-\n\nCOMPARISON TABLE\n\nSATURN\n\nEARTH\n\nJUPITER\n\n6,378 km (3,963 mi.)\n\n71,400 km (44,366 mi.)\n\n60,000 km (37,300 mi.\n\nSatellites\n\n1\n\n13\n\n10\n\nYear\n\n1\n\n11.86\n\n29.46\n\n9h 55m 30s\n\nlOh 14m\n\n1\n\n317.9\n\n95.2\n\n5.5\n\n1.3\n\n0.7\n\n1 A.U.\n\n5.2 A.U.\n\n9.5 A.U.\n\nPARAMETER\nRadius (Equatorial)\n\nDay\n\nMass\nDensity (Water =1)\nMean Distance From Sun\n\n23h 56m 04s\n\n-more-\n\nI\n\nCTi\n\nTHE SATELLITES OF JUPITER\nDIAMETER (km- ni.)\n\nNAME\nAmalthea V\n\nSEMIMAJOR AXIS (km-mi.)\n\nPERIOD\n\n(Days)\n\n240\n\n150\n\n181, 300\n\n112, 650\n\n0.489\n\nlo\n\nI\n\n3,640\n\n2, 660\n\n421, 600\n\n261, 9-50\n\n1.769\n\nEuropa\n\nII\n\n3,050\n\n1, 895\n\n670, 900\n\n416, 400\n\n3.551\n\nGanymede III\n\n5,270\n\n3, 275\n\n1, 070, 000\n\n664, 900\n\n7.155\n\nCallisto IV\n\n5,000\n\n3, 105\n\n1, 880, 000\n\n1,168, 000\n\n16.689\n\nLeda\n\nXIII\n\n2-14\n\n1. 3-8.5\n\n11, 110,000\n\n6,903, 500\n\n240\n\nHimalia\n\nVI\n\n110\n\n11,470,000\n\n7,127, 000\n\n250.6\n\nLysithea X\n\n170\n\n6-32\n80\n\n11, 710, 000\n\n50\n\n7,276, 000\n\n260\n\n11, 740, 000\n\n3. 7-20\n\n7,295, 000\n\n260.1\n\nElara\n\nVII\n\nAnanke\n\nXII\n\n6-28\n\n3. 7-17\n\n20, 700, 000\n\n12,862 ,000\n\n617\n\nCarme\n\nXI\n\n8-40\n\n5-25\n\n22, 350, 000\n\n13,176 ,000\n\n692\n\nPasiphae VIII\n\n8-46\n\n5-28.5\n\n23, 300, 000\n\n14,478 ,000\n\n735\n\nSinope\n\n6-36\n\n3. 7-22\n\n23, 700, 000\n\n14,725 ,000\n\n758\n\nIX\n\n-more-\n\ni\nCTN\nUl\n\n1\n\nTHE SATELLITES OF SATURN\nNAME\n\nSEMIMAJOR AXIS (km-mi . )\n\nDIAMETER (km-mi . )\n\nPERIOD\n\n(Days)\n\nJanus\n\n300 (est. )\n\n187\n\n168,700\n\n105,000\n\nMimas\n\n400\n\n300\n\n185,800\n\n120,000\n\nEnceladus\n\n550\n\n390\n\n238,300\n\n148,000\n\n1.370\n\nTethys\n\n1,200\n\n745\n\n294,900\n\n183,200\n\n1.888\n\nDione\n\n1,150\n\n715\n\n377,900\n\n235,000\n\n2.737\n\nRhea\n\n1,450\n\n900\n\n527,600\n\n328,000\n\n4.518\n\nTitan\n\n5,800\n\n3,600\n\n1,222,600\n\n760,000\n\n15.945\n\n1,484,100\n\n922,000\n\n21.276\n\n3,562,900\n\n2,214,000\n\n79.33\n\n12,960,000\n\n8,093,000\n\n550.45\n\nHyperion\nlapetus\nPhoebe\n\n300 (est. )\n\n1,800\n200 (est. )\n\n187\n\n1,120\n125\n\n(Phoebe1s\nmotion is\nretrograde)\n\n-more-\n\n0.815\n\n.\n\n0.942\n\ni\n\xc2\xa3\ni\n\n-68-\n\nVOYAGER SCIENCE\nThe Voyager mission to Jupiter and Saturn will\naddress fundamental questions about the origin and nature\nof the solar system. Understanding interplanetary space\nand the other planets should give scientists a greater\nknowledge of Earth.\nAccording to current theoretical models of the origin\nand evolution of the solar system, a gaseous nebula composed\nof solar material \xe2\x80\x94 gases and dust of various elements -collapsed to form the Sun. Some of the material remained\nbehind and began to coalesce to form the planets, their\nsatellites, the asteroids, comets and meteors. Temperature,\npressure and density of the gas decreased with distance from\nthe Sun. Formation of the planets is believed to have\nresulted from accretion of the nebular material. Observed\ndifferences in the planets are accounted for in these\ntheories by variations in material and conditions at the\nplaces where they formed. Thus, knowledge gained at each\nplanet can be related to others and should contribute to\nan overall understanding of the solar system as well as\nour own planet Earth.\nMissions to Mars, Venus, Mercury and the Moon have\ncontributed greatly to the body of knowledge. Each planet\nhas its own personality, significantly different from\nothers because of its unique composition and relationship\nto the Sun. Individual as they are, the inner planets\nare related as bodies that originated near the Sun and\nthat are composed mainly of heavier elements. They are\nclassified as "terrestrial planets," since the Earth is\napproximately representative.\nScientists have known for a long time that Jupiter,\nSaturn and the other outer planets differ significantly\nfrom terrestrial planets. They have low average densities;\nonly hydrogen and helium among all the elements are light\nenough to match observations to date. Jupiter and Saturn\nare sufficiently massive (318 and 95 times Earth\'s mass,\nrespectively) to insure that they have retained almost\nall their original material. They are, however, only\nrelatively pristine examples of the material from which\nthe solar system formed. While almost no material has\nbeen lost, the planets have evolved over their 4.6-billionyear lifetimes and the nature and ratio of the materials\nmay have changed. If that 4.6-billion-year evolution can\nbe traced, scientists will obtain a clearer picture of the\nearly state of their region of the solar system.\n- more -\n\n-69-\n\nVoyager Science Investigations\nThe scientific investigations of the Jupiter-Saturn\nmission are multipurpose taking data in a variety of\nenvironments. For example, the ultraviolet spectrometer\nstudies planetary and satellite atmospheres and also\ninterplanetary and interstellar hydrogen and helium.\nThe magnetic fields experiment will examine the magnetospheres\nof the planets and also search for the transition between\nsolar and galactic regions.\nIt is difficult to separate "planetary" from "interplanetary" instruments and investigations. There is,\nhowever, another grouping.\nFirst, the optical scanners, mounted on the spacecraft\'s\nscan platform, have narrow fields of view and must be\naccurately pointed. They collect radiant energy (light,\nfor example) from their targets and create images or spectral\ninformation that permit scientists to understand the physical\nform or chemical composition of the planets and satellites.\nInvestigations in this group include the imaging science\ninstruments (TV), infrared interferometer-spectrometer and\nradiometer, ultraviolet spectrometer and photopolarimeter.\nThe second family of investigations senses magnetic\nfields and fluxes of charged particles as the spacecraft\npasses through them. These instruments are fixed to the\nbody of the spacecraft and have various fields of view.\nTheir data taken together will give information on\nplanetary magnetic fields (and indirectly, interior\nstructure), on Sun-planet and planet-satellite interactions\narid on cosmic rays and the outer reaches of the solar plasma.\nThese investigations are plasma, low energy charged particles,\ncosmic ray and magnetic fields.\nA third family is planetary radio astronomy and plasmawave investigations whose long antenna whips listen for\nplanetary emissions, like those from Jupiter.\nA radio investigation uses S-band and X-band links\nbetween spacecraft and Earth to gather information on\nplanetary and satellite ionospheres and atmospheres and\nspacecraft tracking data to chart gravitational fields\nthat affect Voyager\'s course.\n- more -\n\nPLASMA\nHIGH-CAIN\nDIRECTIONAL\nANTENNA\n\nCOSMIC RAY\nWIDE ANGLE TV\nNARROW ANGLE TV\n\nMAGNETOMETER (1 OF 4)\n\nTV ELECTRONICS\nULTRAVIOLET\nSPECTROMETER\n\nEXTENDABLE BOOM\n\nINFRARED\nINTERFEROMETER\nSPECTROMETER\nAND RADIOMETER\nPHOTOPOLARIMETER\nLOW ENERGY\nCHARGED PARTICLES\n\nTHRUSTERS (16)\nELECTRONIC\nCOMPARTMENTS\nPLANETARY RADIO\nASTRONOMY AND\nPLASMA WAVE ANTENNA\n\nSCIENCE INSTRUMENT\nCALIBRATION PANEL\nAND SHUNT RADIATOR\n\nPROPULSION\nFUEL TANK\n\nRADIOISOTOPE\nTHERMOELECTRIC\nGENERATORS (3)\n\nPLANETARY RADIO\nASTRONOMY AND\nPLASMA WAVE ANTENNA\n\nO\nI\n\n-71-\n\nCosmic-Ray Investigation\nThe cosmic-ray investigation has four principal\nscientific objectives:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nTo measure the energy spectrum of electrons and\ncosmic-ray nuclei;\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nTo determine the elemental and isotopic composition\nof cosmic-ray nuclei;\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nTo make elemental and isotopic studies of Jupiter\'s\nradiation belts and to explore Saturn\'s environment,\nwhose possible radiation belts have not yet been\npositively detected from Earth;\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nTo determine the intensity and directional\ncharacteristics of energetic particles as a\nfunction of radial distance from the Sun, and\ndetermine the location of the modulation boundary.\n\nThe cosmic ray investigation uses multiple-solid state\ndetector telescopes to provide large solid-angle viewing.\nThe low-energy telescope system covers the range from 0.5\nto 9 million electron volts (MeV) per nucleon.

This allows separation of the spacecraft\'s\nmagnetic field from the external field that is to be\nmeasured. The other two magnetometers are high field,\nthree-axis instruments mounted on the spacecraft body.\nThe boom-mounted, low-field instruments will measure\nthe magnetic fields in the range from lOp tesla (0.010 gamma)\nto 50u tesla (50,000 gamma). (Fifty-thousand gamma equals\none-half gauss, about the average magnetic field strength\nat the surface of Earth.)\nThe high-field instruments cover the range from\n25n tesla (25 camma) to 2m tesla (20 gauss). While the\nhighest field strengths measured by the Pioneer spacecraft\nat Jupiter were about 1.4m tesla (14 gauss) scientists expect\nthat localized, stronger fields may be associated with the\nplanets or some of their satellites.\nTotal weight of the magnetic fields investigation is\n5.6 kg (12.3 Ib.).

The\nfirst, known simply as IRIS, was designed for use at\nthe Jupiter and Saturn planetary systems. It is an improved\nversion of the IRIS instrument which flew to Mars on Mariner\nin 1971-72. The second, known as the Modified IRIS, or\nMIRIS, was designed later to be able to perform farther out\nin the solar system at Uranus. Either instrument can be\nflown on the spacecraft because the principal mechanical\nand electrical interfaces are identical. In general, the\nMIRIS instruments will be flown on both Voyager spacecrafts\nif they are completed in time because they offer advantages\nat Jupiter and Saturn as well as at Uranus.

The Voyager spacecraft\'s photopolarimeter\nwill observe how light reflected from Jupiter, Saturn and\ntheir satellites is polarized by the chemicals and aerosols\nin the atmospheres and on the surfaces.\nThe photopolarimeter will measure methane, molecular\nhydrogen and ammonia above the cloud tops. It will study\naerosol particles in the atmospheres of the planets and\nsatellites; the textures and compositions of the surfaces\nof satellites; size, albedo, spatial distribution, shape\nand orientation of particles in Saturn\'s rings; measure\noptical and geometric thickness of the rings; and observe\nthe sky background to search for interplanetary and\ninterstellar particles.\nThe instrument is made up of a 15-cm (60 in.)\nCassegrain telescope, aperture sector, polarization\nanalyzer wheel, filter wheel and a photomultiplier tube\ndetector. The filter wheel carries eight filters ranging\nfrom 2,350-Angstrom to 7,500-Angstrom wavelength; three\nlinear polarizers (0 degrees, 60 degrees and 120 degrees),\nplus "open" or blank.

The instrument will also measure\nplanetary and solar radio bursts from new directions in\nspace and will relate them to measurements made from\nEarth.\nJupiter emits enormous bursts of radio energy that\nare not clearly understood. They appear to be related to\nthe planet\'s magnetosphere, its rotation and even to\npassage of the satellite lo. The energy released in the\nstrongest bursts is equivalent to that of multi-megaton\nhydrogen bombs.\nThe receiver is designed to provide coverage in two\nfrequency bands \xe2\x80\x94 one covering the range from 20.4 kHz\nto 1,345 kHz, the second from 1,228.8 kHz to 40.5 mHz.\nThe receiver bandwidth is 1 kHz in the low-frequench range\nand 200 kHz in the high- frequency band. There are three\nsignal input attenuators to provide switchable total\nattenuation from 0 to 90 decibels.\nThe instrument weighs 7.7 kg (17 Ibs.) and draws\n6.7 watts of power.\nPrincipal investigator is Dr. James W. Warwick of\nthe Department of Astro-Geophysics, University of Colorado.\nPlasma Investigation\nPlasma, clouds of ionized gases, moves through the\ninterplanetary region and comes from the Sun and from\nstars. The plasma investigation uses two Faraday-cup plasma\ndetectors, one pointed along the Earth-spacecraft line,\nthe other at right angles to that line.\nScientific objectives of the plasma investigation\n\nare:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nDetermine properties of the solar wind, including\nchanges in the properties with increasing distance\nfrom the Sun;\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nStudy of the magnetospheres that are intrinsic to\nthe planets themselves and that corotate with the\nplanets independent of solar wind activity;\n- more -\n\n-77-\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nStudy of the satellites of Jupiter and Saturn\nand the plasma environment of lo;\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nDetection and measurement of interstellar ions.\n\nThe Earth-pointing detector uses a novel geometrical\narrangement that makes it equivalent to three Faraday\ncups and determines macroscopic properties of the plasma\nions. With this detector, accurate values of the velocity,\ndensity and pressure can be determined for plasma from th.e\nEarth (1 A.U.) to beyond Saturn (10 A.U.). Two sequential\nenergy scans are employed to allow the instrument to cover\na broad range of energies \xe2\x80\x94 from 10 electron volts (eV)\nto 6,000 electron volts (6 KeV). Significant measurements\ncan be made between subsonic and supersonic speeds in cold\nsolar wind or hot planetary magnetosheath.\n\'\nThe variable energy resolution allows scientists to\ndetect and sort out ions that flow with the solar wind at\nthe same time they are measuring the solar wind\'s properties.\nThe instrument has a large (180-degree) field of view\nat planetary encounters and a 90-degree field of view in\nthe solar wind. No electrical or mechanical scanning is\nnecessary.\nThe other Faraday cup, a side-looking or lateral\ndetector, measures electrons in the range of 10 eV to\n6 KeV and should improve spatial coverage for any drifting\nor corotating positive ions during planetary encounters.\nThe instrument was designed primarily for exploring\nplanets\' magnetospheres. It is capable of detecting hot\nsubsonic plasma such as has been observed in the Earth\'s\nmagnetosphere and is expected from ions originating in\nthe McDonough-Brice ring of lo. The instrument\'s large\nangular acceptance allows detection of plasma flows well\naway from the direction of the Sun, such as plasma flows\nthat corotate with the planet.\nThe plasma instrument weighs 9.9 kg\ndraws 9.9 watts of power.\n\n.;.8 Ib.) and\n\nDr. Herbert Bridge of the Massachusetts Institute\nof Technology is principal investigator.\n- more -\n\n-78-\n\nPlasma Wave Investigation\nScientific objectives of the plasma wave investigation\nare measurements of thermal plasma density profiles at\nJupiter and Saturn, studies of wave-particle interactions\nand study of the interactions of the Jovian and Saturnian\nsatellites with their planets\' magnetospheres.\nThe plasma wave instrument will measure electric-field\ncomponents of local plasma waves over the frequency range\nfrom 10 Hz to 56 kHz.\nThe instrument shares the two extendable 10-m (33 ft.)\nelectric antennas provided by the planetary radio astronomy\nexperiment team. The two groups use the antennas in different\nways. The plasma wave investigation uses the antennas to form\na Vee-type balanced electric dipole, while the radio astronomy\ninvestigation uses them as a pair of orthogonal monopoles.\nIn the normal format, the plasma wave signals are\nprocessed with a simple 16-channel spectrum analyzer.\nAt planetary encounters,the system will provide a spectral\nscan every four seconds.\nThe plasma wave system has a broadband amplifier that\nwill use the Voyager video telemetry link to give electric\nfield waveforms, with a frequency range from 50 Hz to 10 kHz,\nat selected times during planet encounters.\nThe investigation is designed to provide key information\non the wave-particle interaction phenomena that control\nimportant aspects of the dynamics of the magnetospheres of\nJupiter and Saturn. Wave-particle interactions play\nextremely important roles at Earth and scientists understand that at least the inner magnetosphere of Jupiter is\nconceptually similar to that of Earth despite the vast\ndifference in size and in energy of the trapped particles.\nIn addition, the satellites of Jupiter and Saturn\nappear to provide important localized sources of plasma\nand field-aligned currents and they should significantly\naffect the trapped-particle populations.\nThe instrument weighs 1.4 kg (3.1 Ib.) and draws\n1.6 watts of power.\nDr. Frederick L. Scarf of TRW Defense and Space\nSystems is principal investigator.\n- more -\n\n-79-\n\nRadio Science Investigation\nThe spacecraft\'s communications system will be used\nto conduct several investigations by observing how the\nradio signals are changed on their way to Earth.\nBy measuring the way signals die out and return\nwhen the spacecraft disappears behind a planet or satellite\nand then reappears, the radio science team can determine the\nproperties of planetary and satellite atmospheres and\nionospheres.\nThe radio signals also allow scientists to make\nprecise measurements of the spacecraft\'s trajectory as\nit passes near a planet or satellite. Post-flight\nanalyses allow determination of the mass of a body and\nits density and shape.\nThe rings of Saturn will also be explored by the\nradio science team by measuring the scattering of the\nradio signals as they travel through the rings. This\nwill provide measurements of ring mass, particle\nsize distribution and ring structure.\nThe investigation uses the microwave receivers and\ntransmitters on the spacecraft as well as special\nequipment at the Deep Space Network tracking stations.\nThe spacecraft transmitters are capable of sending\n9.4, 20 or 28.3 watts at S-band, and 12 or 21.3 watts\nat X-band. The spacecraft antenna is a 3.67 m (12 ft.)\nparabola and is aimed by special maneuvers performed\nduring planet occultations.\nDr. Von R. Eshleman of the Center for Radar Astronomy,\nStanford University, is the Leader of the Radio Science\nTeam.\nImaging Science Investigation\nThe Voyager imaging system is based on those flown\naboard Mariner spacecraft, with advancements and changes\ndictated by the specific requirements of flybys of Jupiter,\nSaturn and their satellites.\n- more -\n\n-80-\n\nScience objectives for the imaging science investigation include reconnaissance of the Jupiter and Saturn\nsystems, including high-resolution photography of\natmospheric motions, colors and unusual features (such\nas the Great Red Spot and similar smaller "spots"),\nvertical structure of the atmospheres of the planets,\ncomparative and detailed geology of satellites, satellite\nsize and rotation and detailed studies of the rings of\nSaturn.\nTwo television-type cameras are mounted on the\nspacecraft\'s scan platform: a 200mm focal-length, wideangle camera with 4,000-Angstrom to 6,200-Angstrom sensitivity and a 1,500mm focal-length, narrow-angle camera\nwith a 3,200-Angstrom to 6,200-Angstrom range.\nThe ciscs of Jupiter and Saturn will exceed the field\nof view of the narrow-angle camera about 20 days before\nclosest approach. At that time, resolution will be about\n400 km (250 mi.). For several days before and after\nclosest approach, scientists will have several simultaneous\nimaging opportunities:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nPhotography at high resolution of planets whose\nangular diameters are many times larger than the\nfield of view;\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nClose encounters (some comparable with Mariner 10\'s\nMercury flybys) with the major satellites. For\nexample, all four Galilean satellites (Jupiter\'s\nlargest) will probably be photographed at\nresolution better than 4 km (2.5 mi.);\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nMore distant photography of several additional\nsatellites;\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nHigh-resolution photography of Saturn\'s rings.\n\nTo exploit such a variety of opportunities, it is\nnecessary for the spacecraft to return large quantities of\nimaging data. The camera-spacecraft system has been designed\nto return imaging data over a wide range of telemetry rates\nin real time. Data can also be recorded on board the\nspacecraft for later playback to Earth \xe2\x80\x94 during occultation\nby Jupiter, for instance.\nEach camera is equipped with a filter wheel whose\neight individual filters have a variety of uses:\n- more -\n\n-81-\n\nThe wide-angle camera\'s filter wheel contains, one\nclear filter, one each in violet, blue, green and orange\nwavelengths, a seven-Angstrom sodium-D filter for special\nobservations near lo and other satellites and two\n100-Angstrom filters at the wavelength of methane\nabsorption for study of the distribution of methane\nin the atmospheres of Jupiter, Saturn, Titan and Uranus.\nThe narrow angle camera\'s filter wheel carries two\nclear filters, two green and one each of violet, blue,\norange and ultraviolet.\nVoyager will be the first imaging system with narrowband capability to directly observe distribution of atomic\nand molecular species. The seven-Angstrom sodium-D filter\nis the narrowest bandwidth filter ever flown with this kind\nof camera.\nBecause the Voyager spacecraft will pass the planets\nand satellites at high velocities and must take pictures in\ndimmer light than Mariner missions to the inner planets,\nimage smear conditions are more severe than on previous\nflights. To overcome these problems, the camera\'s\npreamplifiers have been redesigned to lower system noise and\nand to incorporate a high gain state. Both changes are\nmeant to provide high quality images with minimum smear.\nDuring the several months before closest approach,\nthe narrow-angle cameras will photograph Jupiter and Saturn\nregularly and often to provide information on cloud motions.\nThese pictures will be taken on a schedule which would\npermit scientists to make motion pictures in which the\nplanet\'s rotation has been "frozen" so that only the cloud\nmotions are apparent. Resolution during the period will\nrange from about 1,600 km (1,000 mi.) to about 400 km\n(250 mi.). Once the planet, grows larger than the narrow\nangle camera\'s field of view, the wide-angle camera will\nbegin its work. The narrow-angle camera will then\nrepeatedly photograph portions of the planets that\nwarrant special scientific interest. Both cameras will\nbe shuttered simultaneously during these periods so\nscientists can relate small scale motions to larger\npatterns.\n\n- more -\n\n-82Because of the nature of the planetary flybys the\ncameras will not be able to concentrate on a single target\nfor hours at a time. As each satellite moves it will present\nan everchanging appearance to the cameras. The planets\'\nclouds will also be in constant motion. Therefore, observational sequences are structured to provide repeated images\nat differing intervals for each target. Additionally, large\namounts of multicolor imaging data will be obtained for the\nplanets and satellites.\nThe camera system weighs 38.2 kg (84 Ib.) and uses\n41.7 watts of power including 8.6 watts for instrument and\nscan platform supplementary heaters.\nDr. Bradford A. Smith of the University of Arizona is\nthe leader of the Imaging Science Team.\nUltraviolet Spectroscopy Investigation\nThe ultraviolet spectrometer looks at the planets\'\natmospheres and at interplanetary space.\nScientific objectives of the investigation are:\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nTo determine distributions of the major constituents\nof the upper atmospheres of Jupiter, Saturn and\nTitan as a function of altitude?\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nTo measure absorption of the Sun\'s ultraviolet\nradiation by the upper atmospheres as the Sun is\nocculted by Jupiter, Saturn and Titan;\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nTo measure ultraviolet airglow emissions of the\natmospheres from the bright discs of the three\nbodies, their bright limbs, terminators and\ndark sides;\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nDetermine distribution and ratio of hydrogen and\nhelium in interplanetary and interstellar space.\n\nThe instrument measures ultraviolet radiation in\n1,200-Angstrom bandwidth in the range from 400 to 1,800\nAngstroms. It uses a grating spectrometer with a microchannel\nplate electron multiplier and a 128-channel anode array. A\nfixed position mirror reflects sunlight into the instrument\nduring occultation. The instrument has a 0.86-degree by\n0.6-degree field of view during occultation and a 0.86by 2-degree field of view for airglow measurements.\nThe ultraviolet spectrometer weighs 4.5 kg (9.9 Ib.)\nand uses 2.5 watts of power.\nDr. A.

Launch will be under the direction of John F. Kennedy Space Center\'s (KSC\'s) Expendable\nVehicles Directorate, Kennedy Space Center, Fla.\nThe Voyager launch opportunity extends from August 20\nto September 23, imposing stringent scheduling requirements\non the team to conduct both launches from a single pad within a short time span. The schedule is even more demanding\nbecause of the plan to launch the Voyager space vehicles\n11 days apart to improve the probability of getting both\nmissions underway before the end of the window September 23.\nThe Titan III facility has two active pads, LC-40 and\nLC-41, but only Complex 41 has been modified to accommodate\nNASA\'s hydrogen-fueled Centaur.\nThe dual Titan Centaur launch operation is almost a\nreplay of the back-to-back Viking launches conducted from\nComplex 41 in the late summer of 1975. The Voyager launches\nare the last missions now scheduled for the Titan Centaur\nrocket.\nLaunch Facilities\nThe Titan III Complex\xe2\x80\x94built on manmade islands in the\nBanana River\xe2\x80\x94consists of: Solid rocket motor servicing and\nstorage areas; a Vertical Integration Building (VIB); a\nSolid Motor Assembly Building (SMAB); Launch Complexes 40\nand 41; and a double-track locomotive system which transports\nthe mated Titan core and Centaur vehicle from the VIB through\nthrough SMAB to launch Complex 41. The rail system covers\na distance of about 32 km (20 mi.) to link the various facilities of the complex.\nHardware Assembly\nThe Titan, Centaur and Centaur portion of the shroud\nare erected and mated in the VIB on a mobile transporter\xe2\x80\x94\numbilical mast structure. Attached to the transporter are\nthree vans which remain connected to the transporter and\n\n- more -\n\n-93-\n\n-94-\n\nvehicle throughout the receipt-to-launch sequence. Upon\ncompletion of integrated tests in the VIE, the assembled\nTitan and Centaur are moved on the transporter to the SMAB.\nAfter the solid rocket motors and core stages are structurally\nmated, the vehicle is moved to the launch complex. A mobile\nservice structure provides access to all mated vehicle stages,\nand an environmental enclosure ("white room") protects the\nCentaur and the spacecraft.\nBecause of the quick turnaround launch sequence required\nby Voyager, the Titan Centaur for the second mission (TC-6)\nwas processed first. The Titan core for TC-6 was erected\nin the VIB on October 12, 1976, and the Centaur stage was\nmated with it October 19. TC-6, without its solid rocket\nboosters, was moved to Complex 41 for checkout and major\ntests January 4, 1977. It was moved back into the VIB for\nstorage April 6.\nThe Titan core for TC-7 was erected on February 3\nthe Centaur stage mated with it February 16. TC-7 was\ninto the SMAB for the installation of its solid rocket\nduring the first week of April and to Complex 41 April\n\nand\nmoved\nboosters\n14.\n\nTC-7 will remain at Complex 41 for testing and final\nlaunch preparations through launch of the first Voyager mission, now scheduled for August 20.\nTC-6 will remain in storage in the VIB until July 20\nwhen it is to be moved into the SMAB for mating with its\nsolid rocket boosters. The move to Complex 41 for final\npreparations for launch of the second Voyager mission is\nscheduled for one day after the launch of TC-7 with the\nfirst Voyager.\nSpacecraft Preparations\nElements of the Voyager spacecraft began arriving at\nKennedy Space Center in April for pre-launch operations,\nincluding assembly, checkout, fueling and encapsulation in\nthe payload section of the shroud. Spacecraft processing\nis the responsibility of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory,\nPasadena, Calif. The propulsion modules were processed in\nESA-60A and the mission modules were processed in\nHangar AO, both at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station.\nFinal assembly and encapsulation was accomplished in\nSpacecraft Assembly and Encapsulation Facility (SAEF)\n1 and 2 in the KSC Industrial Area.\n\n- more -\n\n-95-\n\nThe "pathfinder" or proof test model spacecraft was\nreceived at Kennedy Space Center April 11 and passed through\nthe processing cycle to be followed by the flight spacecraft.\nIt was erected atop TC-7 at Complex 41 during the third week\nof May for pad operations and countdown tests.\nThe first flight spacecraft was received at Kennedy\nSpace Center April 25. After initial processing of the propulsion and mission modules at the Cape they were moved to\nSAEF-1 for mating in mid-July.\nThe nuclear electrical generator power source will be\ninstalled July 31 prior to encapsulation of the spacecraft\nin the payload portion of the shroud August 3. The spacecraft is to be moved to Complex 41 for mating with TC-7\nAugust 5.\nThe second flight spacecraft arrived at Kennedy Space\nCenter on May 23. After initial processing of the propulsion and mission modules at ESA-60A and Hangar AO respectively,\nthey were moved to SAEF-2 during the second week in July.\nThe spacecraft modules were mated during the fourth week of\nJuly. The nuclear electrical generator power source is to\nbe installed and the spacecraft encapsulated in its shroud\nduring the third week of August. If the first Voyager launch\ngoes on schedule, the spacecraft will be moved to Complex 41\nfor mating with TC-6 August 23 in preparation for a launch\nscheduled for September 1.\nLaunch Operations\nLaunch will be directed from VIB, a 23-story structure\ncontaining nine million cubic feet of space. The Launch\nControl Area, consisting of three rooms, is the nerve center\nof the Titan-Centaur Complex. The VIB is located 5,900 meters\n(19,400 feet) from LC-41.\nPress Site 3, the press viewing area for Titan III\nlaunches, is located southeast of the VIB and about 6,100 meters\n(20,000 feet) from LC-41.\n\n- more -\n\n-96-\n\nTYPICAL VOYAGER LAUNCH SEQUENCE\n\nFollowing is a sequence of selected launch vehicle and\nspacecraft events based on an August 20, 1977, launch and a\nJupiter arrival date in mid-July, 1979.\nThe time of events presented in the Table depend on\nlaunch day\xe2\x80\x94arrival day and trajectory. Events initiated\nafter the parking orbit coast, due to coast time variance,\nmay vary in real time as much as 5 minutes over the launch\nperiod for a particular launch day. The relative time of\noccurrence between events after the parking orbit coast,\nhowever, will remain the same. T-time is time from lift\noff, but includes two scheduled holds of 1 hour and 10 minutes\nduration. L-time is essentially real time from lift off and\nhas no scheduled hold. I-time denotes time relative to propulsion module burnout (injection).\n\n- more -\n\n-97-\n\nCount Time\n\nRelative Time\n\nEvent\n\nComments\n\nT-6:50:00\n\nL-8:00:00\n\nUnshort RTGs\n\nS/C power on\n\nT-0:00:00.2\n\nL-0:00:00.2\n\nTitan Stage 0\nignition\n\nTitan solid boosters\n\nT-0:00:00\n\nL-0:00:00\n\nLiftoff\n\nT+0:00:10\n\nVent RTGs\n\nT+0:01:49\n\nStage 0 shutdown\n\nT+0:01:51\n\nStage 1 ignition\n\nT+0:02:02\n\nStage 0 separation\n\nT+0:04:20\n\nStage 1 shutdown\n\nT+0:04:21\n\nStage 1 separation\nStage 2 ignition\n\nT+0:04:31\n\nCentaur shroud\njettison\n\nT+0:07:51\n\nStage 2 shutdown\n\nT+0:07:57\n\nStage 2 separation\n\nT+0:08:08\n\nCentaur main engine\nstart (MES 1)\n\nT+0:09:50\n\nCentaur main engine\ncutoff (MECO 1)\nBegin parking orbit\ncoast\n\nT+0:20:00\n\nL+0:20:00\n\nMinimum RTG power\nafter venting\n\n- more -\n\nPressure release\ndevice actuates\napproximately\n6,100 m (20,000 ft.)\n\n-98-\n\nCount Time\n\nRelative Time\n\nEvent\n\nComments\n\nT+0:40:00\n\nEnter Earth shadow\n\nShadow entry can\nvary between\nT+0:37:30 and\nT+0:51:08 over\nthe launch period\n\nT+0:42:25\n\nCentaur main engine\nstart (MES-2)\n\nMES 2 can vary\nbetween T+0:47:30\nand T+0:56:30\n\nT+0:48:08\n\nCentaur main engine\ncutoff (earliest\nMECO 2)\n\nT+0:58:30\n\nStart post MECO 2\ncoast\n\nMECO 2 can vary\nbetween T+0:53:30\nand T+l:02:30\nlaunch period\nPost MECO 2 coast\ntime is 185 seconds up through\nSept. 12 launches\nand 85 seconds\nthereafter\n\n1-0:02:09\n\nSelect telemetry\nmodulation unit\nstatus\n\nS-band high rate\nchannel\n\n1-0:02:09\n\nSelect flight data\nsubsystem mode\n\nHigh rate engineering data (1200 b.p.s.)\n\n1-0:01:04\n\nActivate propulsion\nmodule batteries\n\nCCS issues DC-4T\ncommands\n\n1-0:01:02\n\nGyros to high rate\nmode\n\n1-0:01:00\n\nSpacecraft-Centaur\nseparation\n\n- more -\n\nSeparation occurs\n15 sec. before\npropulsion module\nignition.\n\n-99-\n\nCount Time\n\nRelative Time\n\nEvent\n\nComments\n\n1-00:00:50\n\nStart solid motor\n\nPropulsion module\nignition\xe2\x80\x94timed\nfrom Centaur\nseparation\n\n1-0:00:00\n\nPropulsion module\nburnout (mission\nmodule injection)\n\nPropulsion module\nburnout injection\nmay occur as early\nas 57.5 min. after\nlaunch or as late\nas 66 min. after\nlaunch throughout\nthe launch period.\n\n1+0:00:05\n\nPost burn mode/5-Ib.\nengine control\n\n100-lb. engines\nturned off\n\n1+0:00:15\n\nCommanded turn\n\nCommanded pitch\nturn of 114\xc2\xb0 at\n2.88\xc2\xb0 per second\n\n1+0:01:02\n\nRelease RTG boom\n\n1+0:01:07\n\nT+l:03:21\n\n100-pound-thrust\nengines enabled\nfor pitch and yaw\ncontrol;

These tasks cover all phases\nof the flight, including telemetry from launch vehicle and\nspacecraft, metric data on both launch vehicle and Voyager,\ncommand signals to the spacecraft and delivery of data to the\nMission Control and Computing Center (MCCC) at JPL.\nThe Tracking and Data System (TDS) will provide elements\nof the world-wide NASA JPL Deep Space Network (DSN), Air Force\nEastern Test Range (AFETR), the NASA Spaceflight Tracking and\nData Network (STDN) and the NASA Communications System (NASCOM).\nDuring the launch phase of the mission, data acquisition\nwill be accomplished through use of the near Earth facilities-the AFETR stations, downrange elements of the STDN, instrumented jet aircraft and a communications ship. Radar-metric data\nobtained immediately after liftoff and through the near Earth\nphase will be delivered to and computed at the AFETR Real time\nComputer system facility in Florida so that accurate predictions can be transmitted to Deep Space Network stations giving\nthe locations of the spacecraft in the sky when they appear\non the horizon.\nTracking and communications with the Voyagers from\ninjection into Jupiter transfer trajectory until the end\nof the mission will be carried out by the Deep Space Network\n(DSN) .\nThe DSN consists of nine deep space communications stations on three continents, a spacecraft monitoring station in\nFlorida, the Network Operations Control Center in the MCCC at\nJPL and ground communications linking all locations.\nDSN stations are located strategically around the\nEarth\xe2\x80\x94at Goldstone, Calif.; Madrid, Spain; and at Canberra,\nAustralia. Each location is equipped with a 64-m diameter\n(210 ft.) antenna station and two 26-m (85 ft.) antenna\nstations.\nThe three multi-station complexes are spaced at widely\nseparated longitudes around the world so that spacecraft\nbeyond Earth orbit\xe2\x80\x94and, for the Voyager mission, the\nplanets Jupiter and Saturn\xe2\x80\x94are never out of view. The\nspacecraft monitoring equipment in the STDN station at\nMerritt Island, Fla., covers the prelaunch and launch\nphases of the mission. A simulated DSN station at JPL,\ncalled CTA-21, provides pre-launch compatibility support.\n\n- more -\n\n-104In addition to the giant antennas, each of the stations\nis equipped with transmitting, receiving, data handling and\ninterstation communication equipment. The downlink includes\nsupercooled lownoise amplifiers. The 64-m antenna stations\nin Spain and Australia have 100-kw transmitters. At Goldstone,\nthe uplink signal can be radiated at up to 400 kw. Transmitter power at all six 26-m stations is 20 kw.\nThe downlink is transmitted from the spacecraft at Sband (2295 mHz) and X-band (8400 mHz) frequencies. The uplink operates at S-band (2113 mHz) only, carrying commands\nand ranging signals from ground stations to the spacecraft.\nOnly the 64-m antenna stations can receive the X-band\nsignal and can receive at both frequencies simultaneously.\nThe 64-m stations will provide continuous coverage during\nplanetary operations and periodically during the cruise\nphase for maneuvers, spacecraft recorder playbacks and dualfrequency navigation sequences. A 26-m antenna subnet will\nprovide continuous coverage\xe2\x80\x94shared by the two spacecraft\xe2\x80\x94\nthroughout the mission.\nVarious data rates for each type of telemetered information are required by the changing length of the telecommunications link and the possible adverse weather effects at\nground stations on reception of X-band radio signals.\nNerve center of the DSN is the Network Operations Control\nCenter at JPL which provides for control and monitoring of DSN\nperformance. All incoming data is validated at this point,\nwhile being simultaneously transferred to the computing\nfacilities of the Mission Control and Computing Center for\nreal time use by engineers and science investigators.\nGround communications facilities used by the DSN to\nlink the global stations with the control center are part\nof a larger network, NASCOM, which connects all of NASA\'s\nstations around the world. Data from the spacecraft are\ntransmitted over high speed circuits. Telemetry at rates\nup to and including 115.2 k.b.p.s. will be carried in real\ntime on wideband lines from Goldstone and Madrid. The Canberra stations will send encounter data in real time at\nrates up to and including 44.8 k.b.p.s. Higher downlink\nrates will be recorded at the station and played back to\nMCCC at 44.8 k.b.p.s.\nSimultaneously with the routing to the MCCC of the\nspacecraft telemetry, range and range rate information\nwill be generated by the DSN and transmitted to the control\ncenter for spacecraft navigation. To achieve the desired\nmaneuver and encounter accuracies, very precise navigation\ndata is required. Navigation information includes S-X\nranging, DRVID (differenced range versus integrated Doppler)\nand multi-station tracking cycles.\n- more -\n\n-105-\n\nCommands are sent from the MCCC to one of the DSN\nstations where they are loaded into a command processing\ncomputer, automatically verified for accuracy and transmitted to the proper spacecraft at 16 bpsec. Commands\nmay be aborted, if necessary. Manual control and entry of\ncommand data at the station is possible in the event of a\nfailure in the high speed data line from the control center.\nFor all of NASA\'s unmanned missions in deep space, the\nDSN provides the tracking information on course and direction of the flight, velocity and range from Earth. It\nreceives engineering and science telemetry and sends\ncommands for spacecraft operations on a multi-mission basis.\nConcurrent with the four-year or longer Voyager mission,\nthe network is supporting the extended mission activities\nof the Viking Project with two Landers on Mars and two\nOrbiters circling the planet; maintaining post-Jupiter\ncommunications with Pioneers 10 and 11; and complementing\nWest Germany\'s space communications facilities on two\nHelios Sun orbiting missions. The DSN also will support\na Venus exploration mission by two Pioneer Venus spacecraft\xe2\x80\x94\na planetary orbiter and atmospheric probe\xe2\x80\x94scheduled for\nlaunch in May and August, 1978, and planetary science activities beginning the following December.\nAll of NASA\'s networks are under the direction of\nthe Office of Tracking and Data Acquisition. JPL manages\nthe DSN. The STDN facilities and NASCOM are managed by\nthe NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Md.\nThe Goldstone DSN stations are operated and maintained\nby JPL with the assistance of the Ford Aerospace and\nCommunications Corp. The Canberra stations are operated\nby the Australian Department of Supply. The stations near\nMadrid are operated by the Spanish government\'s Institute\nNacional de Tecnica Aerospacial.\n\n- more -\n\n-106MISSION CONTROL AND COMPUTING CENTER\nThe Mission Control and Computing Center (MCCC) at\nthe Jet Propulsion Laboratory is the focus of all Voyager\nProject flight operations. It is through the center\'s computer systems that data from the Voyagers pass, are processed and presented to the engineers and scientists for\nanalysis. Through the extensive and varied displays of the\ncomputers in the MCCC, the flight analysts observe and\ncontrol the many ground processing functions and the spacecraft.\nThe MCCC is housed in two JPL buildings containing its\ncomputer systems, communications and display equipment,\nphoto processing lab and mission support areas. The various\nareas are outfitted to satisfy the diverse needs of the\nVoyager mission operations c.eam\xe2\x80\x94requirements of tha mission\ncontrollers, spacecraft performance analysts and science\ninvestigators.\nThe MCCC contains several computer systems designed to\nreceive the incoming Voyager data, process it in real time,\ndisplay it and organize it for further processing and analysis\nAfter the data have been received as radio signals by the\nDeep Space Network (DSN) stations located around the world,\nthey are transmitted to Pasadena and into the MCCC computers,\nwhere the processing begins. Software developed by the MCCC,\noperating in these computers, performs the receiving, displaying and organizing functions. Computer programs generated by other elements of the Voyager Project further process\nthe data.\nCommands causing the spacecraft to maneuver, gather\nscience data and perform other complex mission activities are\nintroduced into the MCCC computers and communicated to a station of the DSN for transmission to the appropriate spacecraft.\nThe MCCC is composed of three major elements, each\nwith its own computer system. They are the Mission Control\nand Computing Facility (MCCF), the General Purpose Computing\nFacility (GPCF) and the Mission Test and Computing Facility\n(MTCF).\nThe MCCF consists of three IBM 360-75 processors and\nsupports the Voyager command, data records and tracking systems. The 360-75s provide the means through which commands\nare sent to the spacecraft. They also are used to process\nand display tracking and data and provide the data management capability to produce plots and printouts for the day to\nday determination of spacecraft operating conditions. The\n360-75s also produce the final records of data for detailed\nanalysis by the science community.\n\n- more -\n\n-107The GPCF, with three UNIVAC 1108 computers, supports\nthe Voyager Project\'s navigation and mission sequence\nsystems. The 1108s also are used to develop prediction\nprograms and detailed spacecraft engineering performance\nanalysis. Computer terminals located in the mission support area allow project analysts to execute their programs\nand obtain results displayed on TV monitors, or on various\nprinters and plotters.\nThe MTCF provides telemetry data processing for the\nscience and engineering information transmitted from the\nVoyagers. Within the MTCF are the telemetry system, imaging\nsystem and photo system. The telemetry system uses three\nstrings of UNIVAC and Modcomp computers to receive, record,\nprocess and display the data as requested by analysts in\nthe mission support areas. The imaging and photo systems\nproduce the photographic products from data generated by\nVoyager\'s TV cameras. Pictures of Jupiter, Saturn and their\nmoons will be analyzed by scientists housed in the mission support areas. Scientists will be provided both electronic and\nphotographic displays.\nMCCC, like the DSN, also supports the other flight\nmissions, Viking, Pioneers 10 and 11, Helios and the upcoming\nPioneer/Venus mission in 1978.\n\n- more -\n\n-108-\n\nVOYAGER TEAM\n\nNASA Headquarters\nOffice of Space Science\nDr. Noel W.
