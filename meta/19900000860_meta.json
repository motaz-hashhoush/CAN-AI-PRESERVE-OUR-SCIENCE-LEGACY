The aerothermodynamics research focused on the hard-body and rocket plume flows. Analytical real gas models to describe finite rate chemistry were developed and incorporated into the three-dimensional flow codes. New numerical algorithms capable of treating multi-species reacting gas equations and treating flows with large gradients were also developed. The computational chemistry research focused on the determination of spectral radiative intensity factors, transport properties and reaction rates. Ab initio solutions to the Schrodinger equation provided potential energy curves transition moments (radiative probabilities and strengths) and potential energy surfaces. These surfaces were then coupled with classical particle reactive trajectories to compute reaction cross-sections and rates.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19900000860, "id": "f19c9d0456a5414692d73e202b92c60c", "publicationDate": "1989-07-10T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19900000860.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19900000860/downloads/19900000860.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19900000860/downloads/19900000860.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19900000860/downloads/19900000860.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
