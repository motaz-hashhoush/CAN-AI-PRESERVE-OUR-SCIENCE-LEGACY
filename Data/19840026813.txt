During the near future the model system\nwill be tested on real-data meteorological systems in support of the VAS\nCooperative Project at the r\xe2\x80\x9dlarshal1 Space Flight Center\nPlans for FY-85:\n\nConvert and recode the remaining programs in LAMPS for portability to\nother computer environments in support of the VAS Cooperative Project.\n195\n\nI\n\n'
