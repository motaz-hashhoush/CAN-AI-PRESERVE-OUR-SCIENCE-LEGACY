After arrival at the planet in September 1997 aerobraking will be used to lower the spacecraft  into a low, sun-synchronous, polar-mapping orbit over several months. Early in 1998 mapping observations will begin and continue for a Mars year (687 days). Following completion of this  first Mars year of mapping the spacecraft will continue to act as a relay orbiter for an additional three Earth years. The five instruments carried involve magnetometry, surface and  atmosphere imaging, atmospheric sounding, laser altimetry, gravity and thermal emission spectroscopy. In addition, the spacecraft carries a Mars relay receiver/transmitter which will  operate over the entire five year orbital mission ending in January of 2003. The Mars Global Surveyor mission is intended to accomplish a portion of the scientific objectives of the  Mars Observer mission which was lost in 1993 three days before entering Mars orbit. The instrumentation to be used for the magnetometers, cameras, laser altimeter, emission spectrometer  and radio science are very nearly the same as those carried by Mars Observer. The spacecraft design will be new but will use spare equipment from Mars Observer and has a mass about two  and one-half time smaller. All experiments will be controlled remotely from their investigators home installation. The long planned period of observation supports the mission's global  and seasonal objectives.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "publications": [{"submissionId": 20060038087, "id": "76210087dedf4625b9900ed135e4e700", "publicationDate": "1995-04-03T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
