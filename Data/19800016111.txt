INTRODUCTION\n\nThe goal of this grant was to pursue research on the generation of\n\ntunable visible, infrared, and ultraviolet light, and on the control of\nthis light by means of novel mode-locking and modulation techniques. The\ngrant, and the program, was a continuation of NASA, Grant NGL-05-020-103.\nActive projects during the year included an analysis of mode-locked and\nfrequency-doubled lasers, a study of energy storage and extraction using\nmetastable atomic levels, the first observation of laser action using an\natomic pair absorption process, and the development of a tunable VUV source\nfor spectroscopic studies.\n\n- 1 -\n\n^\t\n\nA\n\nII. SUMMARY OF RESEARCH\n\nA.\t\n\nEnergy Storage and Extraction Using Metastable Levels\n(R. W. Falcone ) G. A. Zdas iuk, J. F. Young ,, and S. E. Harris)\n\nThe objective of this project w:4s to demonstrate the use of atomic metastable states as energy storage media for potential use as high energy lasers\nand Raman pulse compressors. In particular, we have demonstrated that the\nbarium 6s5d3 D levels can be optically pumped (via an indirect path) and that\nthese levels have long storage times. We have found that it is possible to\ntransfer w 90% of the ground state atoms into th-e 6s5d3 D manifold, and to\nmaintain this population for storage Dimes on the order of tens of microseconds at densities of 10 i6 atoms/cm3 . These conditions correspond to a\nstored energy density of approximately 2 Joules/litre. We have measured the\nstorage time as a function of the barium ground state density and as a function of inert buffer gas densities. We have also observed laser action from\na barium excited state to the ground state on the 7911 R 3 P- 1S intercombination line and also on the l P- 1S resonance line at a = 5535 R . These results point strongly to the possibility that the individual 6s5d 3 D sublevels\nmay be inverted relative to the ground state. If this a.\n\n:4\n\nthe case, the Ba\n\nsystem is potentially a very practical Raman\' medium for upconverting ]IF lasers\nfrom the 2.7-2.9 pin region to Ldie near IR at 7500-8000 X.\n\n- 2 -\n\na\n\nB. Atomic Pais Absorption and Inversion\n(R. W. Falcone, G. A. Zdasiuk, J. F. Young, and S. E. Harris)\n\nDuring the grant period we have demonstrated the use of a novel optical\npumping technique base4 on "atomic pair absorption" as ,a practical means of\npopulating atomic energy levels. The term "atomic pair absorption" refers to\na process whereby two colliding atoms simultaneously absorb a single photon\nat a frequency corresponding to the sum energy of two levels in the separated\natoms. Atomic pair absorption has been observed in barium-thallium mixtures\nusing white light sources. 1 By the use of more intense laser pumping sources\nwe have found that it is possible to construct atomic pair absorption pumped\nlasers. The details of this work are given\n\nin\n\nthe attached paper "Pair\n\nAbsorption-Pumped Barium Laser" (see Appendix A).\n\n1J. C. White, G. A. Zdasiuk, J. F. Young, and S. E.

Harris)\n\nThe spontaneous anti-Stokes VUV light source was proposed by Harris\n1977 and first demonstrated by Zych, et al.\n\n2\n\nin\n\nin 1978, and is a convenient\n\ntechnique for generating intense, pulsed, narrowband, incoherent VUV radiation. The practicality of this source was demonstrated by Falcone, et al.3\nwho used it as a tunable spectroscopic source, to measure the isotopic shift,\nand absolute energies, of the\n\n3 He\n\nand\n\nH\n4\n\nls2s\n\n1S0\n\nstates with a resolution\n\nof 60 \xc2\xb5eV. This represented the first direct measurement of the isotopic\nshift and illustrated the potential of this technique for performing highresolution VUV spectroscopy without the limitations of traditional VUV apparatus: the lack of bright sources, and the low efficiency and resolution\nof VUV spectrometers.\nFalcone, et al. in essence performed an emission spectroscopy experiment using the anti-Stokes source. The goal of this project is to develop\nthis source and to apply it to absorption spectroscopy of high lying atomic\nlevels. The practical requirement is to produce a\xe2\x80\xa2tunable source of high intensity which has an overwhelming majority of its energy in a narrow bandwidth\nthus eliminating the need for a (lossy) VUV spectrometer.\nA schematic of the source and its energy level diagram are shown in\nFig. 1.

The anti-Stokes generation process is merely a scattering process;\na fraction of the incident photon flux is scattered at the tunable sum frequency wls2s + cup into 147r steradians.

The fraction of the generated\nphotons which are actually used in a particular experiment will depend on the\n\neffective solid angle dtt .\nThe differential scattering cross section depends strongly on the frequency of the applied pump wave, becoming very large when the VUV frequency\napproaches a resonance line. Initially, we proposed to pump with radiation\nin the range of\n\n53 00 R and to scatter off the ls2s 1S 0 He level excited by\n\na do discharge. The critical parameter of the source is the ratio of the\nanti-Stokes light to the background He resonance line radiation at 584 ^.\nTherefore, we have been investigating the optimization of the ratio of the\nanti-Stokes light to the background radiation using different discharge\ngeometries to maximize 14\n\nand the collection angle AQ . We have\nls2s \' L )\n\nfound that a hollow cathode discharge and a positive column discharge are\ncomparable in these respects.\nWe have measured this ratio using a flashlamp pumped dye laser which\nprovides peak powers of a few kW as our pump source (see Fig. 2).

Outside of this range the fluctuations of the background exceed the anti-Stokes intensity making its observation impossible.\nHowever ) we will be using a Nd:YAG system capable of producing MW peak powers\nwhich would allow observation of the generated anti-Stokes light over the\nentire range of available dye lasers (N 50 ) 000 cm -l ). In order to use this\nlaser we have developed a detector with a high work function cathode which\nwill not detect scattered visible laser radiation ( at high laser powers this\nradiation can be comparable to the anti-Stokes light).\nAs a preliminary test of the Nd:YAG system we have used its second harmonic (5320 R) at a peak power of 5 MW as our pump laser. This corresponds\nto a detuning of 1100 cm -1 (3 R) from the resonance at 537.04\n\nR. The result\n\nwas an observed anti-Stokes signal five times brighter than the background\nradiation. We believe this is confirmation that the source will be useful\nover the broad tuning range of available dyes.\nThe bandwidth of the generated anti-Stokes light is equal to the convolution of the pump laser bandwidth and the Doppler width of the metastable\nstorage state. In our case this is only a few cm -1 , making the resolution\nand spectral brightness of the device much better than conventional laboratory sources. In the future we propose using this \'technique to measure the\nlinewidth of the innershell excitation of K 3p 54s5s. An energy level diagram\nis shown in Fig. 3 and an experimental schematic is shown in Fig. 4. There\nare good theoretical grounds for believing that the linewidth is relatively\nnarrow, and thus, that the lifetime may be long enough so that it can be used\nin a VUV laser. To date, this linewidth has not been resolved. Generally,\nthe linewidths of innershell excitations are very large because they are\nprone to Auger or "autoionizing" decay.

We plan to investigate \' a number cf autoionizing lines in K, as well\nas in other alkali metals.\nWe note that this source of tunable ) intense, incoherent VUV light has\na number of other, possible ap.14cations: photolithographic fabrication of\nmicrostructures; the analysis of surface composition and properties, including catalytic surfaces; and the testing and evaluation of the compatibility of materials and components in a high VUV flux environment.\n\n6\n\n- 11 -\n\nD., Generation and Applications of_Ultrashort Optical Pulses\n(A.E. Siegman and J-M. Heritier)\nSatellite optical communications systems which are under development\nuse mode-locked lasers to generate the very short, high repetition rate\npulses needed for high data rates in optical links between satellites.\nIn particular, the CW mode-locked Nd:YAG laser is a promising candidate\nfor such space-borne communications systems. It is very desirable,\nhowever, to convert the near infrared oscillation wavelength of the\nYAG laser (1.064 microns) to its second harmonic in the green, in order\nto obtain both much better detector sensitivity and better beam collimation at the shorter wavelength. Because of the low power level involved\nin a CW mode-locked laser, especially in space-borne applications,\ndoubling the laser pulses in the usual fashion with a nonlinear crystal\noutside the laser cavity cannot be done with adequate conversion efficiency.\nThe solution is then to place the doubling crystal inside the laser cavity\nwhere the circulating optical pulse intensity is much larger; and in\nessence to use the harmonic conversion process as the output coupling from\nthe YAG laser.\nWhile this completely solves the harmonic conversion efficiency\nproblem, the presence of a nonlinear doubling crystal inside the modelocked laser can have serious negative effects on the laser mode-locking\nprocess, and can substantially broaden the mode-locked pulses in the laser..\nA reliable and detailed analysis of the pulse forming process in a Laser\nwhich is simultaneously mode-locked and intracavity frequency doubled is\nthus important for optimizing the design and the understanding of such\n\n- 12 -\n\nrW\n\ni\n\nlasers. During the past period we have completed such a detailed\nanalysis that overcomes essentially all of the disadvantages associate\nwith earlier treatments of this problem. Our work includes both cornpu....\n\nstudies and purely analytical results which provide new insight into this\nmode of operation, as well as providing detailed numerical resul\'cs for all\naspects of the laser performance in terms of the fundamental design\nparameters of the laser system. In addition to simplified analytical\ndesign formulas, a simplified but realistic physical description of the\nimportant detuning behavior of this laser is developed. Good agreement\nhas been found between our analysis and experimental studies carried o"t\nin industrial laboratories. In particular, our analysis confirms thki-t\nthe mode-locked pulse width actually decreases as the modulation frequency\nis detuned off resonance; the harmonic power output initially increases\nfor very small detuning, but then decreases; and the pulse shape develops\na sharp edged asymmetry which is of opposite sense for opposite signs of\ndetuning.\n\n- 13 -\n\nr\n\nI\na\t\n\nq\n\n.III.

Ginzion Laboratory, Stanford (University, Stanford, California 94305\nReceived November 11, 1979\nThis is the first reported demonstration of the use of pair-absorption transitions for optically pumping lasers, In\ne mixture of barium and thallium metal vapors, single , photon absorption of 3867 -A laser light caused simultaneous\nexcitation of colliding ground-state atoms to the 13a(Gs6p 1 111) and\'1 1 1(6p zPy.,) excited states. Excited-slate densi.\nties of ahout lo ll cm-3 were created, and subsequent laser emission oil\n\t I1a(6sGp t!\'1)\t\nI3a(6s5d I D2 ) atomic\ntransition at 1.5 pm was observed,\n\nWe describe the first reported demonstration of laser\nexcitation of pair- absorption transitions as a technique\nfor optically pumping new types of lasers. In particular,\nwe have simultaneously excited colliding ground-state\nbarium and thallium atoms to the Ba(6s6p 1 13 1) and\n71 1(6p 2Ps/2) excited states by single-photon absorption\nof laser light at 3867 A. Subsequent laser emission on\nthe inverted Ba(6s6p 1.P1)\t\nBa(6s5d 1 D 2 ) transition\nwas observed at 1.5 \xc2\xb5m.\nPair absorption, or simultaneous excitation, refers to\na process in which two colliding atoms absorb a single\nphotonatawavelength corresponding to the suns energy\nof excited states of the individual species. After the\ncollision the atoms separate, leaving both atoms in excited states. In the case of a dipole dipole collisional\ninteraction, one species makes a (dipole) allowed transition while the other species makes a (dipole) nonallowed transition. The use of laser excitation of pairabsorption transitions for pumping new types of lasers\nwas proposed in Ref. 1. The pair-absorption process\nis it specific example of It general class of reactions now\ncalled laser-induced colliaions. 2.3 Pair absorption has\nrecently been observed in atomic-metal vapors in the\nvisible spectrunl\' l ; previously it had been observed in\nmolecular systems in the infrared.r\'\nWe have studied die pair-absorption process\n\nnumber densities of the colliding atoms; m. is the electron mass; c is the velocity of light; V is the relative velocity of the colliding atoms: p is the Weisskopf radius6\nor depha sing radius of the collision (11 A in this experiment:); and Ow is the frequency detuning of the pump\n\nlaser relative-to the atomic transition in TI, as indicated\nin Fig. 1. Equation (2) was derived by using perturbation theory as detailed in the treatment of laserinduced collisional processes given in Ref. 7. The excited-state densities of both species, 1a*(656p t Pi) and\nTl*(6p 213/2), are given by\n[Ba*] = [Tl*] PIA aTf >>\t\n\n(3)\n\nP\n\nwhere P/A is the power density and 7-p is the pulse\nlength of the applied laser.\nAr, experimental schematic is shown in h\'ig. 2. The\n3867-A radiation was produced by suns-frequency\ngeneration in KD*P of 6075-A and 1.06 - pin laser light\nby using a Quanta Ray Nd:YAG dye-laser system; pulse\nenergies at 3867 A of up to 5 rnJ in a 5-nsec pulse were\navailable. This beam was collimated to a spot size of\n0.15 cm 2 and directed into a metal-vapor oven containing Ba and n heated to 1400 0 C over a vapor-zono\nlength of 10 cm.

Spatial collimation was\nverified by placing a variable aperture between the detector and the cell. As the pump wavelength was tuned\nabout 3867 A, the observed emission wavelength at 1.5\n,um remained constant. Our measurement of the duration of the 1.5- \xc2\xb5m emission was limited by the response time of the InSb detector to <100 nsec. [The\nspontaneous decay time of the Ba(6s6p \'PI) Ba(6s5d\nr D2) transition is \xe2\x80\x94200 nsec.s] The intensity of the\nemission as a function of pump-laser wavelength is\nshown in rig. 4. The intensity maximizes at a pump\n-wavelength of 3867 A, and the profile has an asymmetry\nto longer wavelengths that is also seen oil absorption\nscan in Fig. 3. This asymmetry is predicted from a\nconsideration of the interaction potentials" of the colliding atoms.\nThe bandwidth of the pair absorption is about 1 A (7\ncm -1). This absorption linewidth is characteristic of\nlight-induced collision processes\' and is independent\nof both metal-vapor density (in the linear absorption\nregime) and buffer-gas density.\nThe measured cell absorption of 35%n at 3867 A\nimplies ail pumped excited-state density of\nBa(6s6p r Pi) of about 5 X J0 14 crn -3 at the lasing\nthreshold pump energy of 1 mJ per pulse. This estimated excited-state density is consistent with calculations of the required threshold excited-state density,\nallowing for the l X 10 1" cm-3 thermal population of the\nlower laser level.\n\nN\n\nZ\nZ\n\nW\nJ\n\nit\n\n3867\t\n\n3668\t\n\n3869\n\nWAVELENGTH (A)\n\nFig. 4.

One of the\nmost promising aspects of this technique is that new\nabsorption wavelengths are created by mixing different\nspecies together; this provides a method for channeling\nthe energy of high-powered, fixed-wavelength lasers into\nspecific target states of atoms that otherwise would not\n\nabsorb the radiation.\nA further possible application of this technique is the\nuse of pair absorption for the inversion of atoms and\nmolecules to the ground state, as pointed out in Ref. 1.\nAhigh density of one species will permit Clio inversion\nof the second species to the ground state when sufficient\npump-laser energy is applied at the pair-absorption\nwavelength. One application of this technique would\nbe the temporal and spectral compression of highpowered excimer lasers. The energy sto red in the inverted species by optical pumping with the excimer laser\ncould be rapidly extracted in a narrow-bandwidth pulse\nby Raman, two-photon, or another lasing process to the\n\nMETAL VAPOR\nOVEN\nIesh\n\nSPECTROMETER\nSUMMING\nCRYSTAL\n\nemptied ground state.\nBEAM\t\nCOh181NER\t\n\n1.06\n\'\nG075\n\nWe wish to thank S.

This leads to a simplified Analytical model\ncarried out entirely in the time domain, with atomic 1-mewidth effects\nignored. Simple analytical results for on-resonance ptUe chap,, pulse\nwidth, signal intensity, and harmonic conversion efficiency in terns of\nbasic laser parameters are derived front this model. A simplified pbysical description of the defuning behavior is also developed. Agreement\nis found with experimental studies showing that file pulseNvidth decreases as (lie modulation frequency is defuned off resonance; the\nharmonic power output initially increases and then decreases; and the\npulse shape develops a sharp-edged asymmetry of opposite sense for\nopposite signs of deluning.\n1. INTRODUCTION\n\nI IE CNN\' mode-locked Nd:YAG laser provides a reasonably\nefficient, reliable, and well . engi nec red source of optical\nT\npulses with high repetition rates (^-500 Mllz), narrow pulsewidths (<100 ps), and moderate powers (\xe2\x80\x94 I W average). The\nNd: YAG wavelength of 1.064 pm is, however, further into\n\nthe IR than is desirable for some applications, and the peak\npulse intensity in the output beam is too low to permit cff\'icient second-harmonic gencrtltion Outside the cavity.\nA possible approach is then to employ intracavity secondharmonic generation (SIIG), with the harmonic: crystal placed\ninside the laser cavity, The harmonic conversion efficiency is\nsubstantially increased because of the larger fundamental\nintensity circulating inside the laser cavity, and at the Sallie\ntime only small conversion is rcquire;f j a:\xe2\x96\xbalust the harmonic\nconversion efficiency need only equal tz,c usual output coopling per pass from the laser (typically S 10 percent) to efficiently extract most of the available fundamental power at tits\nsecond-harmonic wavelength,\nThis type of laser call important in satellite optical communications systems, laser radars, and other applications, and\nseveral previous studies of this mode of operation have been\n\npublished Ill the intracavity harmonicgeneration and mode-locking processes are found to be in\nopposition, with the harmonic-generation process producing\na "peak-clipping" effect which substantially broadens the\n\nmode-locked pulses, In addition, the laser performance is\nfound to be extremely sensitive to small detunings between\nthe active mode locking modulation frequency and the actual\nsoundtrip transit time fn the laser.\n\nPreviousanalysesof the mode-locked and frequency-doubled\nlaser [41-[8] have used approximations such as assuming a\nGaussian mode-locked pulse shape and then manipulating the\nparameters of the Gaussian pulse to obtain a self-consistent\n\nsteady-state situation. It will become apparent from this paper\nthat a Gaussian pulse is not all approximation for the\nactual pulse shape in a mode-locked and frequency-doubled\nlaser (as was in fact noted much earlier [4] ). Previous analyses\n\nhave also generally established only indirect connections between basic laser parameters and the resulting mode-locked\nlaser performance, and have in general not explored the important dctuning behavior.\nin this paper, we present bath "exact" computer calculations\nand new analytical results describing file performance of a\n\ntypical CW mode-locl.ed hd : YAG laser with intracavity SI iG,\nincluding dctuning effects, Insights provided by the computer\nresults enable us to develop simple analytic expressions which\ngive the mode-locked pulse shape, pulsewidth, power output,\nand harmonic conversion efficiency for zero dctuning directly\nin terms of the basic design parameters of this type of laser.\nWe also develop a physical picture and analytical results for\n\nthe dctuning behavior of the laser in response to small changes\nin modulation frequency or cavity length. These results\nappear to be in good agreement with such experimental results\nas are available.\nIn the remainder of the paper, Section II briefly reviews the\nbasic analytical model, while Section lit presents exact computer solutions based oil model. Section IV then develops\na simplified form of the analytical model for zero dctuning,\n\nleading to simple analytical expressions I\'m all the basic oil.\nresonance performance characteristics of the System. These\nexpressions are also expanded into greater detail in the Appen.\ndix. Finally, Section V gives further results for the detuning\nbehavior of the laser, based oil simplified anaiytical model.\nThe work described here was first motivated by experimental\nresultsobtained by U. Radecki and A. Kramer at GTE: Sylvania\n\n191. The agreement between these analytical and experimental\nresults is found to be quite good.\nLI.

An arbitrary initial pulse f \xe2\x80\x9e in the time domain (for\nexample, a pulse with in initially uniform amplitude through\nthe full modulation cycle) was stored in the data array; transformed (in place) into the frequency domain; and then muk.\nplied by the discrete double-pass version of file complex\namplifier-cavity transfer function, namely\n\n_ 2g _\t\n1\n2n (fdlfin) n .\t\n^A(fir) = Cxp 1I + 2\n/(frrrl d\'fa) it + l\n\n(20)\n\nA suitable initial value of the gain 2g was used to start the calculation.

The procedure\ncan then be repeated for a new detuning or new values of other\nbasic laser parameters.\nFig. 10 illustrates the behavior of the major pulse parameters\nversus detuning for a typical case as predicted by this analysis.\nIn calculating the results shown in Fig. 10, we used an initial\nnoise intensity 1, (--t,) equal to 10 -10 times the peak intensity,\nafter veril\'ying that the results did not change significantly for\nvariations as large as 3-5 orders of nlagnitucle in the starting\nnoise level.\n\n- 30 -\n\nSILGMAN AND HLRITILRc MODL-LOCKL p AND IN\'rRACAVITY FREQULNCY-DOMILLD Nd:YAG LASL\xe2\x80\xa2\'R\ns\t\n\n!\n\nThe general detuning behavior shown in Fig. 10 appears to\nbe in close qualitative and even quantitative agreement with\nunpublished experimental results [9) . That is, the fundamental puisewidth rNt decreases steadily with increasing detuning because of the sharp edge produced oil the leading\nor trailing edge of the pulse clue to the processes described in\nFig, 8. The fundamental pulse energy also falls off monotonically, presumably because of the same pulse clipping. At\nthe same time, the conversion efficiency actually increases\nslightly, probably because the changed pulse shape means the\nfundamental pulse spends more of its total time at high intensities. The peak pulse intensity may also rise slightly. As\na result, the second-harmonic pulse energy falls off somewhat\nmore slowly. Our analysis even gives sonic indication of a\n\nVI. CONCLUSION\n\nWe believe the analysis and the physical processes described\nin this paper give a good description of the primary effects\ncontrolling both the zero-detuning performance and the detuning behavior of the mode-locked and intracavity frequencydoubled laser under conditions typical of the CW Nd:YAG\nlaser. The analyses are simple enough that results should be\nreadily obtainable for other sets of laser parameters, In accordance with experimental experience, the nonlinearity of\nthe SHG is not particularly critical, while the detuning behavior is extl\'Cnlcly critical.\nANIVINDtx\nANALYTIC: RESULTS r-, Ott ZmRo D1:T\'UNING\n\nThis appendix presents several useful analytic approximations\nderived from the rcro-detuning formulas of (27)-(30) in\nvarious limiting eases.\n\nA.
