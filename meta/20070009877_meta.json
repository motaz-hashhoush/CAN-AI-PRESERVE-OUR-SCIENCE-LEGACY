In a NASA ground study, subjects received PMZ and their cognitive performance was then monitored over time. Subjects also reported sleepiness using the Karolinska Sleepiness Score (KSS), which ranges from 1 - 9. A problem arises when using KSS to establish an association between true sleepiness and performance because KSS scores tend to overly concentrate on the values 3 (fairly awake) and 7 (moderately tired). Therefore, we defined a latent sleepiness measure as a continuous random variable describing a subject s actual, but unobserved true state of sleepiness through time. The latent sleepiness and observed KSS are associated through a conditional probability model, which when coupled with demographic factors, predicts performance.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20070009877, "endDate": "2007-08-02T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Statistical Association", "location": "Alexandria, VA, United States"}}, "meetingId": "cc69193e1f63487aa9a47fab0952c3ff", "id": "1eda8307dcbb4607bdadd30a8be454ee"}], "name": "Joint Statistical Meetings", "location": "Sal Lake City, UT", "id": "cc69193e1f63487aa9a47fab0952c3ff", "startDate": "2007-07-29T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20070009877, "id": "b45305b8a31744eaba9d3873a73606fc", "publicationDate": "2007-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
