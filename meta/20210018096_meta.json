The Artemis Exploration Roadmap endeavors to establish a sustained human presence on the lunar south pole starting in 2028. Within the planned Artemis Base Camp, most efforts to date have focused on the habitation assets or a mixture of science and habitation assets . With the recent advent of commercial lunar landing capabilities, the trade space can be further expanded to include dedicated science focused assets that ensure adequate science capability. To that end, the Forge, an innovation team initiative created at the Johnson Space Center (JSC), explored alternative ways to increase the science capabilities within the basecamp. The Forge uses structured brainstorming and facilitation to increase innovation within the assigned team, while executing its process in a rapid turnaround fashion for ideation and design study. As a pilot study for the Forge, a multi-disciplinary team investigated a lunar lab module to augment the lunar surface plans for Artemis. This formulation study evaluated the scientific and operational considerations for this dedicated crew space that would increase the capabilities of lunar surface science operations. The trade space evaluated single lunar lander delivery versus multiple lunar lander delivery for module assembly, alternative structural designs, the science instrument outfitting with mapping to scientific goals to maximize lunar science objectives, and how the lab would be operated. The lab operations options explored a stand-alone facility, as well as a facility integrated into a larger lunar surface complex, while evaluating crew usage and habitability considerations. The resulting alternatives were evaluated by the Forge team with a set of metrics to determine their originality, feasibility, and science performance, and thereby  provide a recommendation to the lunar architecture planning team. Lessons learned from the lunar lab study were compiled to improve the process and tools for future Forge studies. Forward work, open issues, and challenges to further refine the design of the various science-focused asset options were also documented. By providing a robust science capability at humanity\u2019s furthest outpost, we can plan for a sustained human lunar presence once the initial lunar surface access capability is well established.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "US", "submissionId": 20210018096, "endDate": "2022-03-12T06:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"organizationId": "c89d4cba478b520a8c47b5bcac2f6911", "meta": {"organization": {"name": "Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers", "location": "Piscataway, New Jersey, United States"}}, "meetingId": "39cd2f1c4e07456893e30a06b2376a18", "id": "bc8ecc7e83914441b9c5035af81c63d8"}], "name": "IEEE Aerospace Conference", "location": "Big Sky, MT", "id": "39cd2f1c4e07456893e30a06b2376a18", "url": "https://aeroconf.org/", "startDate": "2022-03-05T06:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document", "name": "LunarLab2022Abstract(update).docx", "type": "ABSTRACT", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20210018096/downloads/LunarLab2022Abstract(update).docx", "pdf": "/api/citations/20210018096/downloads/LunarLab2022Abstract(update).docx.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20210018096/downloads/LunarLab2022Abstract(update).docx.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
