The innovation is suitable\nonly for bearings that are inoperative during exposure to\nthe dynamic forces and must operate satisfactorily after\nremoval of these forces.\nUsing preload springs or blocking the bearings in\nprevious mounting methods exposes the bearings to\nconsiderably higher stress under vibration along the shaft\naxis.\nAs shown in the cutaway of the bearing protector,\nthe bearing is press fitted on the rotor shaft and slip\nfitted into the bearing housing. The bearing stop contacts the inner race only and stops the shaft and bearing\nwhen moving along the shaft axis, removing the load\nbetween the balls and races. The outer race will contact\nthe preload spring just prior to the bearing inner race\ncontacting stop. The amount of contact is dependent\nupon the preload required.\n\nHousing\t\n\nULU\n\nShaft\n\nConventional bearing configurations with preload\nsprings do not have the bearing stop and would compress\nthe preload spring until the motion is stopped. If the\nstopping loads are sufficiently high, the preload spring\ncan be overstressed and damage the bearing races and\nballs.\nShims are used to maintain the desired bearing preload and preload spring deflection which is dictated by\nthe particular bearing, bearing preload, and application.\nIn certain applications where bearing torque and size are\ncritical, use of smaller bearings may be permissible.\n\nNote:\nNo additional documentation is available.
