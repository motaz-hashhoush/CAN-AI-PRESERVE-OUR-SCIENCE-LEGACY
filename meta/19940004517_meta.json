The technological focal point is on the development of automated and robotic systems for the implementation of a Lunar Oasis produced by automation and robotics (LOARS). Under direction from the NASA Office of Exploration, automation and robotics have been extensively utilized as an initiating stage in the return to the Moon. A pair of autonomous rovers, modular in design and built from interchangeable and specialized components, is proposed. Utilizing a 'buddy system', these rovers will be able to support each other and to enhance their individual capabilities. One rover primarily explores and maps while the second rover tests the feasibility of various materials-processing techniques. The automated missions emphasize availability and potential uses of lunar resources and the deployment and operations of the LOAR program. An experimental bio-volume is put into place as the precursor to a Lunar Environmentally Controlled Life Support System. The bio-volume will determine the reproduction, growth and production characteristics of various life forms housed on the lunar surface. Physiochemical regenerative technologies and stored resources will be used to buffer biological disturbances of the bio-volume environment. The in situ lunar resources will be both tested and used within this bio-volume. Second phase development on the lunar surface calls for manned operations. Repairs and reconfiguration of the initial framework will ensue. An autonomously initiated, manned Lunar Oasis can become an essential component of the United States space program. The Lunar Oasis will provide support to science, technology, and commerce. It will enable more cost-effective space exploration to the planets and beyond.", "title": "Cislunar space infrastructure: Lunar technologies", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-16T15:01:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19940004517, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Faller, W."}, "organization": {"name": "Colorado Univ.", "location": "Boulder, CO, United States"}}, "id": "40202aed5dc84d0585b1a6e114b62e75"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19940004517, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Hoehn, A."}, "organization": {"name": "Colorado Univ.", "location": "Boulder, CO, United States"}}, "id": "3c99fc057936465f962911bc7aadcf17"}, {"sequence": 2, "submissionId": 19940004517, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Johnson, S."}, "organization": {"name": "Colorado Univ.", "location": "Boulder, CO, United States"}}, "id": "e406ae46f9394c7394c197b14abe1854"}, {"sequence": 3, "submissionId": 19940004517, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Moos, P."}, "organization": {"name": "Colorado Univ.", "location": "Boulder, CO, United States"}}, "id": "8fc13e390565426989c91470bed1a8ec"}, {"sequence": 4, "submissionId": 19940004517, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Wiltberger, N."}, "organization": {"name": "Colorado Univ.", "location": "Boulder, CO, United States"}}, "id": "d56d6d13caa943c5a52cec08728aa133"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2017-03-16T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19940004517, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19940004517, "id": "8e684ff4b8884c0f86f3f78962e87d4f", "publicationName": "USRA, NASA(USRA University Advanced Design Program Fifth Annual Summer Conference", "publicationDate": "1989-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 19940033285, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "Workshop on Scaling Effects in Composite Materials and Structures", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PROCEEDINGS", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}, {"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 19940004512, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "NASA/USRA University Advanced Design Program Fifth Annual Summer Conference", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PROCEEDINGS", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
