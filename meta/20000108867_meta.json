The Station is currently being operated jointly by NASA and Russian space organizations. In May 1999, the Space Shuttle was the first vehicle to dock to the International, Space Station. A crew of seven U.S. and Russian astronauts delivered 4000 pounds of supplies, made repairs to communications and battery systems, and installed external hardware during an EVA. The next module, the Russian Service Module, is due to join the orbital complex this year. This will initiate a period of rapid growth, with new modules and equipment continually added for the next five to six years, through assembly complete. The first crew is scheduled to begin permanent occupation of the International Space Station early next year. Hardware is being developed by Space Station partners and participants around the world and is largely on schedule for launch. Mission control centers are fully functioning in Houston and Moscow, with operations centers in St. Hubert, Darmstadt, Tsukuba, Turino, and Huntsville going on line as they are required. International crews are selected and in training. Coordination efforts continue with each of the five partners and two participants, involving 16 nations. All of them continue to face their own challenges and have achieved their own successes. This paper will discuss the status of the ISS partners and participants, their contributions and accomplished milestones, and upcoming events. It will also give a status report on the developments of the remainder of the ISS modules and components by each partner and participant. The ISS, the largest and most complicated peacetime project in history, is flying, and, with the help of all the ISS members, will continue to grow.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"country": "Netherlands", "submissionId": 20000108867, "endDate": "1999-10-06T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "International Astronautical Federation", "location": "Paris,  France"}}, "meetingId": "4e1516b3f01e4495bb56fa494cf4c0bc", "id": "5341ea86f37d40109f534d6f4b7ac10e"}], "name": "International Astronautical Congress", "location": "Amsterdam", "id": "4e1516b3f01e4495bb56fa494cf4c0bc", "startDate": "1999-10-04T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20000108867, "id": "f9e59a0259ab4da28ac2cf82c6c824a2", "publicationDate": "1999-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
