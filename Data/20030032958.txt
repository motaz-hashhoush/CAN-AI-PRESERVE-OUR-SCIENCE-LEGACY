The future\nstrategy to decrease long-haul flights will increase the demand for short-haul flights. Since\npassengers prefer to meet their destinations quickly, airlines will increase the frequency of\nflights, which will reduce the passenger load on the aircraft. If a point-to-point flight is not\npossible, passengers will prefer only a one-stop short connecting flight to their final destination.\nA 150-passenger aircraft is an ideal vehicle for these situations. It is mid-sized aircraft and has a\nrange of 3000 nautical miles. This type of aircraft would market U.S. domestic flights or interEuropean flight routes.\nThe objective of the design of the 150-passenger aircraft is to minimize fuel consumption. The\nconfiguration of the aircraft must be optimized. This aircraft must meet CO2 and NOx emissions\nstandards with minimal acquisition price and operating costs.\nThis report contains all the work that has been performed for the completion of the design of a\n150 passenger commercial aircraft. The methodology used is the Technology Identification,\nEvaluation, and Selection (TIES) developed at Georgia Tech Aerospace Systems Design\nlaboratory (ASDL). This is an eight-step conceptual design process to evaluate the probability of\nmeeting the design constraints. This methodology also allows for the evaluation of new\ntechnologies to be implemented into the design.\nThe TIES process begins with defining the problem with a need established and a market\ntargeted. With the costumer requirements set and the target values established, a baseline\nconcept is created. Next, the design space is explored to determine the feasibility and viability of\nthe baseline aircraft configuration. If the design is neither feasible nor viable, new technologies\ncan be implemented to open up the feasible design space and allow for a plausible solution.\nAfter the new technologies are identified, they must be evaluated to determine the physical\ncompatibility of integrating multiple technologies and then the impact on the design, both\nimprovements and degradations, must be determined. These technologies are assessed\ndeterministically. Again, Response Surface Equations (RSEs) are developed to allow for a fullfactorial evaluation of the combinations of the technologies. The best combination of\ntechnologies is selected and then the design space is again reevaluated for feasibility and\nviability.\n\nPage i\n\nDeliverable #5 \xe2\x80\x93 Complete Report\n\nTable of

Similar to other complex systems, the development of\na new aircraft is very cost significant. Traditionally, the design process of an aircraft starts with\nthe sizing of the aircraft via the initial estimate of its design takeoff gross weight. This approach,\nhowever, becomes inapplicable when the design concept in hand is revolutionary in nature as the\ntraditional method heavily depends on making crude estimations and approximations from the\ndatabase of previously existing designs. Moreover, the method involves too many vague\nassumptions that could affect the reliability of the end product of the conceptual design stage.\nThis situation will cause changes being made to the design in later stages.\nAs being investigated in the product design process from manufacturing point of view, changes\nin later stages will correspond to higher added costs compared to that incurred if changes were\nmade in early stages [1]. To avoid this from happening, the knowledge of the design should be\nincreased in the early stages as to ensure that the generated design concept will have high\ncompatibility with the downstream process.\nIn order to explore the design space, a new method of concept assessment in aircraft design,\nnamely the Technology Identification, Evaluation and Selection (TIES), has been developed at\nthe Georgia Tech Aerospace Systems Design Laboratory (ASDL). TIES is defined as a\n\xe2\x80\x9ccomprehensive, structured, and robust methodology for decision making in the early phases of\naircraft design\xe2\x80\x9d [2]. This allows the designer to determine if there is a feasible and viable design\nfor the given requirements available within the existing level of technology. If the design space\ndoes not exist for the current technology, TIES allows for the evaluation of new or upcoming\ntechnologies and their impact on the design and will assess different technology combinations.\nThis method will enable \xe2\x80\x9cthe designer or the decision maker to easily assess and trade-off the\nimpact of various technologies in the absence of sophisticated, time-consuming mathematical\nformulations\xe2\x80\x9d [2]. The TIES method in general comprises of eight steps as listed below:\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n5.\n6.\n7.\n8.\n\nProblem definition\nBaseline and alternative concepts identification\nModeling and simulation\nDesign space exploration\nSystem feasibility and viability determination\nTechnology alternatives specification\nTechnology alternatives assessment\nSelection of best family of alternatives\n\nPage 13\n\nDeliverable #5 \xe2\x80\x93 Complete Report\nThe generic process of the TIES method is shown in Figure 1 [3].\n\nItera\n\nIterative\n1\nDefine\nthe\nProblem\n\n2\n\n3\n\nDefine\nConcept\nSpace\n\n4\n\nModeling\nand\nSimulation\n\nInvestigate\nDesign\nSpace\n\n5\nFeasible\nor\nViable?\n\n6\nIdentify\nTechnologies\n\ntive\n\n7\n\n8\n\nEvaluate\nTechnologies\n\nSelect\nTechnologies\n\ntive\nItera\n\nIterati\nve\nFigure 1: TIES Technical Approach\n\nFor this project, the task for the team is to design a 150-passenger commercial transport aircraft\nby utilizing the TIES method. The project will go through each of the steps of the method as\npresented in this report. Please, note that all costs and prices are in 1996 dollars.\n\nPROBLEM DEFINITION\nThe first step in the TIES process is to define the problem. There must be a distinct societal need\nto drive the design of a new commercial aircraft. The markets that can utilize this type of aircraft\nas well as competitors must be clearly outlined. In developing a new aircraft, the design must be\ntailored to the customer requirements as to suit the existing market needs and this is usually\nachieved by using the Quality Function Deployment (QFD) [1]. This is a method of converting\nthe \xe2\x80\x98voice of customers\xe2\x80\x99 and correlating them to the corresponding \xe2\x80\x98voice of the engineers\xe2\x80\x99.\nThese system metrics can be objective (maximize, minimize, etc.) or constrained with target\nvalues. These requirements will merit if a design is adequate or poor.\nThe problems that create the need for a new design of a 150-passenger aircraft category can be\nidentified through the assessment of the related operational markets. The important parameters\n(engineering characteristics of the product) that need to be achieved have been given as results of\nQFD from previous market studies. These parameters are important in establishing the\nadvantages of the new design against its competitors. Thus, the target or constraint values for the\nnew design are derived by investigating the target markets and the existing competitive aircrafts.\nDesign Need Identification\nThe operational markets for a 150-passenger aircraft have been investigated and from the\noutcome from this assessment, it can be concluded that a need for a new aircraft is tightly related\nto the growth of both the world Revenue Passenger-Miles (RPM) and Revenue Ton-Miles\n(RTM), and also the world\xe2\x80\x99s air traffic flow pattern. In addition to these factors, the changes in\nthe aviation regulations and airlines operational trend will also drive the development of a new\naircraft design. The impacts of these factors in contributing towards the need for a new aircraft\ndesign are further discussed.\n\nPage 14\n\nDeliverable #5 \xe2\x80\x93 Complete Report\nGrowth of Revenue-Passenger Mile (RPM)\nA positive future global market forecast has been made by both Boeing and Airbus which runs\nover the next 20 years period of study. The report published by the former predicted an annual\ngrowth of about 4.5% for the world\xe2\x80\x99s RPM over the study period [4] while that of the latter put\nforward an estimated annual increase of 4.9% [5]. It should be noted that both figures were\nderived by using the year 2000 as the base reference year and changes may occur due to the\nabnormality trend of the industry with the September 11 tragedy.\nA further look into these figures indicates that a larger share of the world\xe2\x80\x99s added ASM by the\nyear 2021 will be in the short-haul markets, taking as large as 96% of the total [4]. Short-haul\nmarkets in general correspond to the regional and domestic flight operations, which are being\ndominated by regional jets and intermediate-size aircraft. To further solidify this, Boeing has\npredicted that by the year 2021, the regional short-haul markets will increase its market share to\nabout 2,736.57 (RPM in billions) as compared to only 1,059.91 (RPM in billions) in 2001 [5].\nThe future strategy of fragmenting more long-haul flights and airport-pairings is one of the\nreasons for the projected increase in demand of short-haul flights. Aircraft passengers will prefer\nto reach their destinations as quick as possible, with reduced number of hub connections and\nnumerous flight segments [4]. \xe2\x80\x9cWhere possible, airlines will provide passengers point-to-point\nservice on busy routes. When this is not economically feasible, passengers will prefer carriers\nwho move them over a single hub with one-stop connecting service to their final destination\xe2\x80\x9d [1].\nGenerally, the long-haul flights will be fragmented into one long-range flight (maybe interregional route) and a short domestic or regional connecting flight. In order to provide a\ncompetitively quick connecting service, the airlines will have to increase the frequency of its\nshort-haul flights service and this strategy has been touted as the future \xe2\x80\x9cprimary form of nonprice competition\xe2\x80\x9d between airlines [4]. The anticipated consequence impact from this prediction\nwill be an increase in the number of passenger fleets required to cope with the upward trend of\nthe market demand. This also takes into consideration that most of the current fleets will be\nretired from service by the year 2021. An estimated total of 23,248 new deliveries of passenger\naircraft will be needed by the year 2021 to meet the capacity demand, replacing more than 7,327\nof the current fleets that are predicted to be removed from service [6]. Figure 2 shows how the\nflight frequency and airport pairs have increased from 1980 to 2000 [4].\nIncrement Index (Base Index: 1980 =100)\n\n250\n\n200\n\n150\n\nFlight Frequency\nAirport Pairs\n\n100\n\n50\n\n0\n1980\n\n1985\n\n1990\n\n1995\n\n2000\n\nYear\n\nFigure 2: Airlines Provide Passengers with More Frequencies and Airport Pairs\n\nPage 15\n\nDeliverable #5 \xe2\x80\x93 Complete Report\nSince the short-haul markets are predicted to take up the biggest portion of the future world\xe2\x80\x99s\nRPM, the future need for new aircraft to operate in these flight routes will be the most demand.\nBoeing has predicted sales of more than 7,883 single-aisle, 121-170 seats capacity category\naircraft for the year 2002-2021, the highest of all seats categories [6]. On the other hand, the\nhighest projected sales for Airbus aircraft are in the 100-175 seats capacity category, with an\nestimated of 7,570 new deliveries by the year 2019 [5] as shown in Figure 3. These facts\ncorrespond well with the predicted short-haul markets growth, as these aircraft types are the\ncurrent dominant choices for the short-range operations.\n8000\n7000\n\nNumber of Aircraft\n\n6000\n5000\n4000\n3000\n2000\n1000\n0\n70 & 85\n\n100 to 175\n\n210 & 250 300, 350 & 400\nSeat-Category\n\n> 400\n\nFigure 3: New Passenger Deliveries of Airbus Aircraft\nGrowth of Revenue-Ton Mile (RTM)\nAnother factor that creates the need of new aircraft is the increase in the projected world cargo\ngrowth. A significant percentage of the revenue of the commercial systems came from the cargo\noperations, which uses converted transport aircraft. Boeing has predicted that the world cargo\nwill increase at 6.4% annual rate for the next 20 years, which implies an increase from 85.19\nbillion RTM in 1999 to approximately 292.04 billion RTM in 2019, as illustrated in Figure 4 [6].\n2019\n2014\n2009\n\nYear\n\n2004\n1999\n1994\n1989\n0\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n300\n\n350\n\nRevenue Ton-Mile (in billions)\n\nFigure 4: Projected World Air Cargo Growth\nThe Airbus company, on the hand, predicted a slightly less annual growth rate of 5.7% through\nthe year 2019 [5]. This increase is mainly "stimulated by the development of global e-commerce\nand manufacturing trends" [5] with the likes of services by UPS, FedEx, and other major\ncarriers.\nIn parallel response with the projected growth and anticipated retirement for some of the current\nfreighter fleets, Airbus predicted an additional 3,090 total new aircraft will be needed to cope\nPage 16\n\nDeliverable #5 \xe2\x80\x93 Complete Report\nwith the cargo market demands by the year 2019, which consist of 2,390 conversions and 700\nnew freighter aircraft [7]. The forecast by Boeing also put forward a need for about 2,600 new\nfreighters by year 2019, with an estimated 70% of the additional fleets will be from modified\npassenger and cargo aircraft [5].\n\nPercent Market Share (%)\n\nA 150-passenger aircraft, as discussed before, is taken as a medium size aircraft category. By\nlooking at the Figure 5 [5], the midsize aircraft, which consists of the medium standard-body and\nmedium wide-body aircrafts, is predicted to have a significant operational market share. This\nindirectly implies a need for new medium size aircraft (also converted passenger aircraft) to fill\nin the operational cargo market demands.\n50\n45\n40\n35\n30\n\nSmall Aircraft\nMedium Aircraft\nLarge Aircraft\n\n25\n20\n15\n10\n5\n0\n1999\n\n2019\nYear\n\nFigure 5: Predictions of World Freighter Fleet Units\nRegulation Changes\nIn addition to the anticipated increase in both RPM and RTM growth, the changes in commercial\naviation regulation also imposed a need for a new design of aircraft. It is well known that a major\nconstraint in flight operation is the aviation regulations put forth by the governing bodies in the\nindustry. These include International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and other aviation\ngoverning organizations such as Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Civil Aviation\nAuthority (CAA) and the European Union. One of the most widely used regulations is the\nFederal Aviation Regulations (FAR) by the FAA. For a transport aircraft, FAA has specified that\nthe aircraft must be aligned with the FAR Part 25, 34, 36, 33, 91 and 121 [8].\nFor future commercial transport operation, environmental compliance will be a major force in\ndesigning a new aircraft. Stricter changes have been made regarding the environmental criteria of\nthe codes by which the emission and the noise levels from the commercial aircraft operation will\nhave to decrease significantly to continue operating. Although these changes will only be\neffectively employed in the near future, they have already constrained the future operation of\nmost current passenger fleets. Thus, the airlines will need a new \xe2\x80\x98environmentally friendly\xe2\x80\x99\ndesign that satisfies the new codes to avoid any complication in their future operation.\nFrom the discussion above, it has been shown that there exists a need for a new design of aircraft\nto suit the future operational requirements. The design should not just be tailored to provide the\ncapacity for the increased passengers demand or expected cargo growth but also have the\nperformance criteria that follow the governing operational regulations. A new design of a 150\nPage 17\n\nDeliverable #5 \xe2\x80\x93 Complete Report\nseats capacity passenger aircraft is then found to be relevant to the needs of the market,\nespecially in serving the high demand of short-haul passenger markets with the new regulation\nconstraints.\nTarget Markets\nFrom the market outlook by Boeing, the domestic flying in North America and Europe have the\ntwo largest market shares for the total world\xe2\x80\x99s air traffic by the year 2021, with 1,007.02 (RPM\nin billions) and 694.54 (RPM in billions) respectively [4]. Airbus also predicted that the US\ndomestic sector would have the largest share of the world\xe2\x80\x99s traffic at the end of year 2019 with\n17% of the total [5]. Therefore, the two main target markets for utilization of the new design will\nbe the North America and Europe regional sectors. This selection of target markets is well\njustified as the two markets are projected to make up almost 40% of the future total air traffic\ndemand in year 2021[4]. Figure 6 shows the comparisons between the RPM in year 2001 and\nthe predicted RPM in year 2021 for the top five operational commercial transport markets in the\nworld [4].\n\nRevenue Passenger-Mile (in billions)\n\n1200\n\n1000\n\n800\n\nNorth America\nEurope\nNorth Atlantic\n\n600\n\nOther Asia-Pacific\nEurope-Asia\n\n400\n\n200\n\n0\n2001\n\n2021\nYear\n\nFigure 6: Air Travel Growth by Region\nA more thorough investigation on the flight operations in each of these two sectors is required as\nto capture all the requirements needed for the design to be successfully operational. An airline\noperates on the basis of the idea of profit optimization. To be competitive in the market, one has\nto make a good strategy regarding fleets selection and the operational service routes.\nTypical flight destinations served coverage in the North America regional sector, taking Boston\nas the center airport and the capability of a B737-800 aircraft is shown in Figure 7 [12]. In\ngeneral, the longest short-haul markets flight routes range will be around 1620 nm with the\ncommon practice of airport pairings such as Seattle-Chicago (1500 nm) [6].\n\nPage 18\n\nDeliverable #5 \xe2\x80\x93 Complete Report\n\nFigure 7: Typical North American Flight Destinations\nFor the European sector, the common flight routes coverage are shown in Figure 8 [12], which is\nconfigured by using Brussels as the center airport and using the capability of a B737-800 aircraft.\nThe flight routes are shorter than the ones for US domestic flight sector, with the longest being\njust around 815 nm. Typical airport pairings as shown in the figure are London-Rome (756 nm\n[9]) and London-Stockholm (810 nm [9]).\n\nFigure 8: Common European Flight Destinations\nFrom the cargo operation point of view, the North America regional market is predicted to\nundergo a steady growth of 4.3% annually from 2001 to 2019 [6] whereas for the Intra-Europe\nsector, the growth is expected to be at a base of 5.6% annually for the same study period [6].\nPage 19\n\nDeliverable #5 \xe2\x80\x93 Complete Report\nFigure 9 shows the predicted trend of cargo traffic growth from the year 2001 to year 2021, with\nthe inclusion of the year 1991-2001 data, for the North American market [6]. On the other hand,\nFigure 10 shows the predicted trend of cargo traffic growth from the year 2001 to year 2021,\nwith the inclusion of the year 1991-2001 data, for the Intra-European market [6].\n\nRevenue Ton-Mile (in billions)\n\n35\n30\n25\n20\n15\n10\n5\n0\n1991\n\n1996\n\n2001\n\n2006\n\n2011\n\n2016\n\n2021\n\nYear\n\nFigure 9: Predicted North American Cargo Market Growth\n\nRevenue Ton-Mile (in billions)\n\n3.5\n3\n2.5\n2\n1.5\n1\n0.5\n0\n1991\n\n1996\n\n2001\n\n2006\n\n2011\n\n2016\n\n2021\n\nYear\n\nFigure 10: Predicted Intra-European Market Growth\nTherefore, the selection of these two target markets, although mostly based on passenger\ntransport operation rather than cargo, still in a good shape since both markets are predicted to\nhave an increase in both operations.\nCompetitor Aircraft\nThe competition for the design will come from the existing designs that are currently being\nutilized in the target markets. It is therefore essential for the design to have the edge against its\ncompetitors as to operate in the two markets.\n\nPage 20\n\nDeliverable #5 \xe2\x80\x93 Complete Report\nTo have a more accurate idea on the competitive existing designs that are currently filling up the\noperations of intended target markets, one could look through the current fleet utilized by the\nregional airlines in the respective markets. Southwest Airlines (North America) and Ryanair\n(Europe) are the two airlines taken as examples for their respective operational flight markets.\nThey are good references since their operations are limited to regional sector only.\nThe current fleet for Southwest Airlines is summarized in Table I [10]. In similar response,\nRyanair also utilizes 44 B737-series aircraft in its operations [11]. Thus, it appears evidently that\nthe current Boeing 737 series are the ones that are heavily utilized for the short-haul markets.\nTable I: Current Southwest Airline Fleet\nType\n737-200\n737-300\n737-500\n737-700\n\nNumber\n27\n194\n25\n120\n\nSeats\n122\n137\n122\n137\n\nHowever, apart from the B737 series, there are also other intermediate-size aircraft that are being\nused to operate the short-haul markets. Among the designs are the A320 family and the MD-80\nseries aircraft.\nA summary of comparison between the A320, MD 82 and B737-800 (the latest in B737-series)\nin few performance characteristics is shown in Table II [12, 13 &14]. These aircraft are chosen\nfor their similar passenger capacity range as the intended new design. These characteristics\nwould be regarded as references in designing the new design, as the goals of the design is to\nproduce a new design that tops all the existing design in suiting the future market needs.\nTable II: Competitive Aircraft Performance Characteristics\nCharacteristics\nPassengers\n2-class configuration\n1-class configuration\nMax.

These are categorized into performance, economics, and\nPage 21\n\nDeliverable #5 \xe2\x80\x93 Complete Report\nmiscellaneous metrics. These metrics are defined below and are summarized in Table III, with\ntheir associated constraints.\nPerformance Metrics\nApproach Speed (Vapp) is defined as the stall speed of the aircraft times a safety factor (1.3 for\ncommercial aircraft). The approach speed is important to passenger, crew, and ground safety\nwhile landing. Enough speed is necessary to control the aircraft while landing and is greatly\naffected by the wing area; therefore a minimization of the approach speed induces an increased\nwing area. A lower approach speed could also be accomplished using control surfaces for\nincreasing the lift of the aircraft produced while landing.\nLanding Field Length (LdgFL) is defined as the horizontal distance traveled by an aircraft from\nthe point at which the aircraft is 50 feet high from the ground to the point at which the aircraft\nreaches a complete stop. FAR requirements include a 66.7 % additional field length to account\nfor irregular landing procedures [15]. The landing field length limits the aircraft to airports that\nhave a field length distance of at least the same length required by the aircraft. This metric is\ndirectly related to approach speed. A higher approach speed requires a longer runway and viceversa.\nTakeoff Field Length (TOFL) is defined as the distanced horizontally traveled by an aircraft\nfrom the point of initial acceleration to the point at which the aircraft is 35 feet high from the\nground. It is also taken in consideration the distance required for a complete stop in case of\nengine failure or other emergencies during takeoff. This metric also limits the aircraft to airports\nwith a minimum field length distance equal to the takeoff field length required by the aircraft.\nTakeoff field length is largely affected by the wing area and thrust. A shorter takeoff field length\nrequires a combination of more thrust and a larger wing area.\nCO2/ASM (CO2) is the amount (lb) of CO2 per available seat mile. Laws concerning the\nenvironment limit the emissions of this greenhouse gas. It is important to minimize it in order to\ncreate a cleaner aircraft complying with all regulations. The 150-passenger aircraft design must\nconsider the reduction of CO2 emissions by 25% of the baseline value by 2007 and a 50%\nreduction by 2022. CO2is defined as [16]:\n\nCO2 / ASM = 3.155\n\nMission _ Block _ Fuel\n(Total _ Pax _ Capacity ) \xe2\x88\x97 (Range)\n\nEqn. (1)\n\nNOx are the oxides of nitrogen emissions, which includes NO and NO2. NO2 is a reddish brown\ngas and is an active compound in the photochemical smog formation. NO is a precursor to the\nformation of NO2. It is also important to minimize this parameter for environmental reasons.\nMostly airlines are concerned with this metric because of regulations that each aircraft has to\ncomply with. The goal for the design of the 150-passenger aircraft is to reduced the NOx\nemissions baseline 25% by 2007 and 50% by 2022.\nTakeoff Gross Weight (TOGW) is the total weight of the aircraft before starting the specified\nmission. It is equal to the sum of the empty weight, fuel weight, crew weight, and payload\n\nPage 22\n\nDeliverable #5 \xe2\x80\x93 Complete Report\nweight. It is closely related to all the economics of the aircraft and closely related to the\noperation costs. It is typically used as a minimizing factor in design. The gross weight of the\naircraft is used for specifying what kind of aircraft it will be, its size, range, payload capabilities,\nthrust required, and what airports can handle that size of aircraft.\nEconomics Metrics\nThe Acquisition Price (Acq $) is the cost for the airline to purchase the airplane from a\nmanufacturer. The less expensive the aircraft is for the manufacturer to build, the less the price\nmust be to the airline. The cheaper it is to acquire an airplane, the lower ticket prices for\npassengers can be allowed for airlines to make a certain profit and decrease their investment. It\nis desirable to minimize the acquisition price that the airline must pay for an aircraft.\nResearch, Development, Testing, and Evaluation Costs (RDT&E) are costs to the manufacturer\nfor the research and development required for the design of the aircraft as well as flight-testing\nand FAA certification. The acquisition price is influenced by the amount the manufacturer\nspends on RDT&E costs and that too is then reflected on how much airlines must charge\npassengers for tickets.\nThe Average Required Yield per Revenue Passenger Mile ($/RPM) is the amount of money that\nthe airline must charge each passenger-per-mile of flight to achieve a particular return on\ninvestment. The lower this amount is, the more money the airline can collect as profit. This also\naffects the amount that the airline must charge the passenger for a ticket.\nThe Direct Operating Cost plus Interest (DOC+I) reflects on the affordability of the airplane.\nThis cost incorporates all costs associated with the operation of the aircraft for each one-way\nflight including: fuel, oil, crew salaries, airframe maintenance, depreciation, insurance, and\nlanding fees plus the interest the airline pays on the loan for the purchase of the aircraft. These\ncosts are measured in cost per aircraft seat mile. The amount of the DOC+I consists of 55% of\nthe passenger\xe2\x80\x99s ticket price [17]. The larger the DOC+I, the more passengers must pay for a\nticket or more passengers must be on the airplane for the flight to be profitable for the airline.\nThe Total Airplane Related Operating Costs (TAROC) includes all costs associated with the\naircraft except for passenger and cargo related costs. This includes the DOC+I plus all ground\nhandling, property, maintenance, depreciation, communication and control, and general and\nadministrative costs, which accounts for 10% of the passenger\xe2\x80\x99s ticket price [17]. This is\nmeasured in dollars per aircraft seat mile, which is similar to revenue passenger mile except that\nit includes both empty and occupied seats. The lower this cost is, the cheaper it is for the airline\nto operate the aircraft.\nThe objective for each economic parameter will be minimization in this design study. By\nreducing any of the costs associated with the aircraft, either in RDT&E, acquisition price, or\noperating costs, the overall life-cycle-cost for the airplane can be reduced. This will increase the\nyield for the airline, decrease the passenger\xe2\x80\x99s ticket price, and increase the number of aircraft\nsales for the manufacturer.\n\nPage 23\n\nDeliverable #5 \xe2\x80\x93 Complete Report\nMiscellaneous Metrics\nThe only miscellaneous parameter that must be considered is the Wing Aerial Weight (WAWt).\nThis is a parameter on the structural performance merit of the wing. The calculation for WAWt\n[16] is:\nWingWeight\nWAWt =\nEqn. (2)\nWingArea\nIn aircraft design, weight has a large effect on the performance of the aircraft. The less each\ncomponent weighs, the less lift required to fly the airplane. Therefore, it is desirable to minimize\nthe WAWt because the less the wing weighs with the same wing area; the larger the lift is for\nthat configuration. The material of the wing, which is directly linked to its weight, determines\nthe process necessary for manufacturing.\nThe values of the baseline aircraft and the desired targets are displayed in Table III.\nTable III: System Level Metrics\nMetric\n\nBaseline\n\nTarget/Constraint\n\nUnits\n\nPerformance\nApproach Speed (Vapp)\nLanding Field Length (LdgFL)\nTakeoff Field Length (TOFL)\nCO2/ASM (CO2)\n\n106.8\n4897\n5367\n0.24605\n\nknots\nft\nft\nlb/ASM\n\nNOx (NOx)\n\n456\n\nTakeoff Gross Weight (TOGW)\nEconomics\nAcquisition Price (Acq $)\nResearch, Development, Testing & Evaluation Costs\n(RDT&E)\nAverage Required Yield per Revenue Passenger Mile\n($/RPM)\nTotal Airplane Related Operating Costs (TAROC)\nDirect Operating Cost plus Interest (DOC+I)\n\n148,219\n\n< 130\n< 7000\n< 7000\n-25 % for 2007\n-50 % for 2022\n-25 % for 2007\n-50 % for 2022\n< 175,000\n\nlbf\n\n59.259\n4,721.8\n\nMinimize\nMinimize\n\nM$\nM$\n\n0.134\n\nMinimize\n\n$\n\n6.752\n5.279\n\nMinimize\n-25% for 2007\n-50% for 2022\n\n\xc2\xa2/ASM\n\xc2\xa2/ASM\n\n10.48\n\nMinimize\n\nlb/ft2\n\nMiscellaneous\nWing Aerial Weight (WAWt)\n\nlb\n\nBASELINE AND ALTERNATIVE CONCEPTS IDENTIFICATION\nIn the conceptual design of a commercial transport, there are a plethora of combinations of\nsubsystems that could satisfy the requirements. This next step in the TIES process involves the\nidentification of possible alternatives for the configuration of the aircraft and its performance by\nPage 24\n\nDeliverable #5 \xe2\x80\x93 Complete Report\nlooking at the trend of operation of its intended target markets and its competitors. This can be\nachieved through brainstorming and organizing the options in a Morphological Matrix. From the\noptions, a baseline is chosen. Then, the design variables of importance are chosen and baseline\nvalues are assigned to them for initial sizing. This step also involves choosing ranges for the\ndesign variables.\nAlternatives for the baseline that were considered are listed in Table IV. The main configuration\nof the aircraft (wing and tail, dihedral wing, conventional fuselage, and low wing) was chosen to\nbe similar to the current aircraft in the market. The morphological matrix also shows alternatives\nfor the materials used in the production of the aircraft, and for the study, aluminum was chosen\nfor the wing and fuselage. The concept selected is just one of the possible 12 million\ncombinations.\nTable IV: Morphological Matrix\nAlternatives\nCharacteristics\nVehicle\nConfiguration\nMission\n\n3\n\n4\n\nWing and Tail\n\nWing And Canard\n\nWing, Tail, and\nCanard\n\nWing\n\nDihedral\n\nAnhedral\n\nFlat\n\nFuselage\n\nConventional\n\nNon-conventional\n\nWing Position\n\nParasol Wing\n\nHigh Wing\n\nPilot Visibility\n\nSynthetic Vision\n\nConventional\n\n1 class\n\n2 classes\n\n3 classes\n\nRange (nm)\n\nPropulsion\n\n2\n\nCabin Layout\n\nStructures\n\n1\n\n2000\n\n3000\n\n4500\n\nPassengers\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n0.700\n\n0.785\n\n0.830\n\n0.900\n\nTurbojet\n\nTurboprop\n\nTurbofan\n\nEngines\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\nBy-pass\n\nN/A\n\nLow\n\nHigh\n\nWing Materials\n\nAluminum\n\nComposites\n\nTitanium\n\nFuselage Materials\n\nAluminum\n\nComposites\n\nTitanium\n\nDihedral Angle\n\nCruise Mach\nNumber\nType\n\nMid Wing\n\nLow Wing\n\nAluminum and\nComposites\nAluminum and\nComposites\n\nThe design variables of importance are those shown in Table V. These variables represent the\ndesign space to be investigated in the study. Once the baseline description is chosen, a sizing\nand synthesis code was run and the baseline variables were obtained as those representing an\nairplane that could be built in the year 1997. A range for these variables was carefully chosen in\norder to maintain the sizing and synthesis code from producing invalid data or crashing (also\nshown in Table V). The sizing and synthesis code used is very sensitive to large variations of\n\nPage 25\n\nDeliverable #5 \xe2\x80\x93 Complete Report\nparameters, especially T/W and W/S, therefore high attention when establishing the for T/W\nratio and wing area.

It has two turbofan engines with high\nby-pass ratio. The aircraft is designed to cruise at a Mach number of 0.785 at 40,000 feet in\naltitude. Figure 11, which shows the exterior physical dimensions of the 737-800, is taken as a\nvalid representation of the baseline aircraft of this study [12].

The use of a vehicle sizing\nand synthesis code allows for these tradeoff studies.\nThe modeling and simulation environment is provided by the usage of the Flight Optimization\nSystem (FLOPS). This is an aircraft sizing code which includes subprograms for weights,\naerodynamics, engine cycle analysis and performance, mission performance, takeoff and landing,\nand program control [18]. This program has been developed by NASA Langley Research Center\nfor assistance in the conceptual phase of design and analysis in aircraft concepts. FLOPS is\nlinked to Aircraft Life Cycle Cost Analysis (ALCCA) for the prediction of the economics\ninvolved with the aircraft design, manufacturing, and service.\nALCCA has been modified by Georgia Tech Aerospace Systems Design Laboratory and has\nbeen seamlessly linked to FLOPS. The user inputs economic variables into the FLOPS input file\nand ALCCA computes economic metrics including RDT&E costs, manufacturer and airline\nreturn on investment (ROI) and cash flows, acquisition costs, direct and indirect operating costs,\nand annual interest rates [19].\nDesign Mission\n\nThe main goal in the design of the 150-passenger aircraft is to minimize the fuel consumption.\nThe mission for the design aircraft is that of a typical commercial transport aircraft mission. In\nother words, the aircraft will generally be used to transport passengers from one airport to\nanother. In a nominal flight operation, the design is supposed to do the sequential mission\nsegments of taxi out-takeoff-climb-cruise-descent-land-taxi in. In addition to that, a reserve\nsegment is also taken into consideration in sizing the aircraft. The reserve segment of the mission\nprofile will consist of additional climb-cruise-descent-hold mission legs, in sequential order.\nThere are different optimization approaches to the aircraft operation for the climb, cruise and\ndescent segments of the mission. For the climb segment, the aircraft is expected to climb to a\nmaximum cruise altitude of 40,000 feet in a minimum fuel-to-climb manner. However, the climb\n\nPage 27\n\nDeliverable #5 \xe2\x80\x93 Complete Report\nspeed will be governed by the FAA regulation, which limits the climb speed to a maximum 250\nknots calibrated airspeed below 10,000 ft altitude.\nThe two cruise segments for the main mission and the reserve mission are subjected to different\noptimization approaches. For the cruise segment of the main mission, the aircraft operation will\ntry to achieve cruise at optimum altitude for specific range at a fixed Mach number of 0.785. The\noptimization is done while also trying to minimize the fuel consumed. On the other hand, for the\ncruise segment of the reserve mission, the cruise altitude is fixed at 25,000 ft and the aircraft is\nexpected to fly at an optimum Mach number for endurance, which relates to the minimization of\nthe fuel flow, at that particular cruise altitude. The maximum cruising Mach number for this\nsegment is taken as 0.6 and similar to the main mission cruise, the approach should also try to\nminimize the emission level of NOX instead of just fuel. For both cruise segments, the\ninstantaneous rate of climb for cruise ceiling calculation will be at 300 ft/min.\nFor the descent segment, the aircraft is to descent at an optimum lift-to-drag ratio. The descent\nspeed will also be governed by the FAA regulation, which limits the maximum of 250 knots\ncalibrated airspeed below 10,000 ft altitude. All the mission segments are summarized in the\ndesign mission profile as depicted in Figure 12 and listed Table VII.\n4\n9\n3\n\n5\n8\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n6\nMain Mission Segments\n\n7\n\n10\n11\n12\n\n13\n\nReserve Mission Segments\n\nFigure 12: Mission Profile\nTable VII: Summary Description on Each Mission Segment Profile\nLeg No.\n0\n1\n2\n3, 8\n4\n5, 10\n9\n\nSegment\nWarm-up\nTaxi-out\nTakeoff\nClimb\nMission Cruise\nDescent\nReserve Cruise\n\n11\n\nHold (loiter)\n\n6, 12\n\nLanding\n\n7, 13\n\nTaxi-in\n\nDescription\n\nAllocated time: 9 minutes\nTakeoff time: 2 minutes at maximum 7000ft takeoff length.\nClimb with minimum fuel-to-climb profile optimization.\nCruise climb to optimum altitude (1000ft \xe2\x89\xa4h\xe2\x89\xa4 40000ft) at M=0.785\nDescent with optimum lift-to-drag ratio.\nCruise at optimum Mach number at fixed 25000ft cruise altitude\nand M\xe2\x89\xa40.6.

These assumptions, especially from the sizing point\nof view, are closely related to the outcome of the Morphological Matrix completed in Step 2.\nThe design of a 150-passenger vehicle (12 business class and 138 economy class), requires 2\npeople for the flight crew and 4 people for the cabin crew in a 3000nm mission flight range. The\nweight for each passenger is assumed to be 165 pounds with an additional 44 pounds for\nbaggage. As can be seen from the optimization approach discussed before, the maximum cruise\naltitude is taken as 40,000 ft and the fixed cruise Mach number is 0.785.\nAlso included into consideration are the reserve mission segments, where additional range of\n150nm to alternate airport, with cruise at fixed altitude of 25,000 ft at an optimum Mach number\nand also a hold time of 45 minutes with Mach 0.785 at optimum altitude.\nThe aircraft configuration will be conventional, as defined by the result of the Morphological\nMatrix, which indicates a wing-tail-fuselage configuration combination, with 2 engines mounted\non the wing (one on each side), and the baseline values for the variables in Table III. A more\ndetailed summary on these sizing assumptions, in addition to those specified above, is provided\nin Appendix A.\nIn addition to the sizing assumptions, the design also has to be assessed from the economic point\nof vie to ensure that the resulting design is profitable and economically feasible. The\nassumptions that have been made in investigating the economic feasibility of the design are\ntabulated in Appendix A.\nEngine Performance\n\nThe engine that has been selected for this aircraft is a NASA Lewis engine. There are two wingmounted engines that have 26,000 lbf of thrust each at sea level static (SLS). The fuel tanks are\nlocated in the wings with a total fuel capacity of 41,050.7 lbm. The thrust versus Mach number\nat different altitudes for this engine is located in Figure 13. The plot shows that the thrust\navailable decreases with altitude and Mach number. As the altitude increases, the density of the\n&\nair decreases. From the continuity equation mair = \xcf\x81 \xe2\x88\x9e Ai v\xe2\x88\x9e and thus a lower density means a\nlower mass flow rate, resulting in less thrust. Similarly, the mass flow rate is increased by a\nlarger velocity, or Mach number. However, from the thrust equation [20]:\n&\nT = mair (v e \xe2\x88\x92 v\xe2\x88\x9e ) + ( p e \xe2\x88\x92 p \xe2\x88\x9e ) Ae\n\nEqn. (3)\n\nas v\xe2\x88\x9e increase, the term (ve \xe2\x88\x92 v\xe2\x88\x9e ) decreases, thus decreasing the thrust. According to Anderson\nin reference 20, the two affect essentially cancel each other out, resulting in an almost constant\nthrust for subsonic speeds. For the design point at 40,000 feet in altitude and a Mach number of\n0.785, the thrust approximately 5100 lbf. The fuel flow for this engine decreases with altitude as\nshown in Figure 14. For the design point, the fuel flow is roughly 3000 lb/hr. These are both\nplotted at maximum power.\n\nPage 29\n\nDeliverable #5 \xe2\x80\x93 Complete Report\n12000\n\nFuel Flow (lb/hr)\n\n10000\n\nAltitude - Sea Level\nAltitude - 2000 ft.\nAltitude - 5000 ft.\nAltitude - 10, 000\n\n8000\n\nDesign Point:\nM=0.785\nAlt.=40,000 ft\nFuel Flow=3000 lb/hr\n\n6000\n\nDesign Point\n\nAltitude - 15,000 ft.\nAltitude - 20,000 ft.\nAltitude -25,000 ft.\nAltitude - 30,000 ft.\nAltitude - 35,000 ft.\nAltitude - 39,000 ft.\nAltitude - 43,000 ft.\n\n4000\n\n2000\n\n0\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\n0.9\n\n1\n\nMach Number\n\nFigure 13: Thrust vs. Mach Number at Different Altitudes at Maximum Power\n30000\n\nDesign Point:\nM=0.785\nAlt.=40,000 ft\nThrust=5100 lbf\n\n25000\n\nThrust (lbf)\n\n20000\nAltitude - Sea Level\nAltitude - 2000 ft.\nAltitude - 5000 ft.\nAltitude - 10, 000 ft.\n\n15000\nAltitude - 15,000 ft.\n10000\n\nDesign Point\n\nAltitude - 20,000 ft.\nAltitude -25,000 ft.\nAltitude - 30,000 ft.\nAltitude - 35,000 ft.\nAltitude - 39,000 ft.\n\n5000\n\nAltitude - 43,000 ft.\n\n0\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\n0.9\n\n1\n\nMach Number\n\nFigure 14: Fuel Flow vs. Mach Number at Different Altitudes at Maximum Power\nDrag Polars\n\nDrag polars for the baseline aircraft at different Mach numbers at sea level and at a cruise\naltitude of 40,000 ft. are located in Figure 15 and Figure 16, respectively.

The manufacturer demands a 5% down\npayment on the aircraft, five years before delivery. The cost for manufacturing is $44.8 million\nper aircraft and is sold with a 12% Return of Investment (ROI) for the manufacturer at $59.2\nmillion. The manufacturer will break even within the twelfth year (141 month) of production.\nThis will be the 326 unit sold out of 800 units.

The program starts off slow, with a\nproduction of three aircraft for each month. During the middle segments of production, this\nnumber doubles for each month.

The cost to the manufacturer for one unit is over 100 times that to\nmanufacture 800. This is because the RTD&E costs are the same no matter how many units are\nmanufactured and costs for airframe, propulsion, and avionics components are cheaper, the more\nis produced. It is also because the manufacturer gets better at building aircraft with more\npractice; the more they build the best, faster, and cheaper it is to make.\n\nAcquisition Cost (Million $)\n\n10000\n\n1000\n\n100\n\n10\n\n1\n1\n\n10\n\n100\n\n1000\n\nNumber of Units Produced\n\nFigure 19: Acquisition Cost as a Function of Units Produced\n\nPage 33\n\nDeliverable #5 \xe2\x80\x93 Complete Report\nA short study of the effects of altering the production schedule was performed.

The following are terms associated operation ROI:\nThe net income, or the gross income returned by an investment remains constant over the\n20 year period.\nPage 36\n\nDeliverable #5 \xe2\x80\x93 Complete Report\nThe operating cost to the airline is the direct and indirect operating costs associated with\nthe functioning of the airline as an entire system.\nInterest accumulates on the loan that the airline must take out for the acquisition of the\nairplane.\nDepreciation is the value the airplane decreases over time, which is at a constant rate.\nThe earnings before tax are the annual revenue minus the operating costs.

Then, with the metamodels, the optimum configuration is calculated\nusing an optimization procedure. There are different methods and computer programs, which can\nbe used for obtaining the metamodels. For the purpose of this report, the metamodels will be\ncreated using FLOPS, ALCCA, a statistical software package called JMP, the probabilistic\nsoftware Crystal Ball, and the spreadsheet program Excel. The following sections describe terms,\nmethods, and the procedure taken for obtaining metamodels describing the design parameters\nand the design variables listed in Table XI. Also included in this section, are the procedures\nperformed for validating the models and the description of the procedure used for calculating\ncumulative distribution functions of the design parameter for evaluating the design space.\nTable XI: Design Variables and Parameters for Metamodel of System\nDesign Variable\nDesign Parameter\nWing Area\nApproach speed\nThrust to weight ratio\nLanding field length\nWing aspect ratio\nTakeoff field length\nWing taper ratio\nCO2/ASM\nWing thickness to chord ratio at root\nNOx\nWing thickness to chord ratio at tip\nTakeoff gross weight\nWing quarter-chord sweep\nAcquisition price\nHT aspect ratio\nRDT&E costs\nHT taper ratio\nAverage required yield per RPM\nHT thickness to chord ratio\nTotal airplane related operating costs\nHT area\nDirect operating cost plus interest\nVT aspect ratio\nWing aerial wt\nVT taper ratio\nVT thickness to chord ratio\nVT area\nDesign of Experiment (DoE)\n\nIn investigating the parameters that affect the quality or performance of a product or process, the\nanalysis of variance and regression techniques are utilized to determine the sources of the\ndifferences without making changes to the process [21]. However, the results from these\ntechniques can sometimes be misleading to the efforts on optimizing the desired product or\nprocess because a few of the contributing elements may be overlooked or the desired end product\nPage 39\n\nDeliverable #5 \xe2\x80\x93 Complete Report\nis not reproducible when used according to the traditional approach of changing one variable at a\ntime. Furthermore, the couplings effects between the parameters are also tend to be neglected\nwhen following the traditional methodology.\nThese weaknesses or inaccuracies in assessing the contributing parameters lead toward a new\nimproved approach. This is when DoE techniques come into play. \xe2\x80\x9cThe (statistical) design of\nexperiments (DoE) is an efficient procedure for planning experiments so that the data obtained\ncan be analyzed to yield valid and objective conclusions\xe2\x80\x9d[22]. \xe2\x80\x9cDoE techniques offer structured\napproach to change many factor settings within a process at once and observe the data\ncollectively for improvements or degradations\xe2\x80\x9d, which will \xe2\x80\x9cyield not only a significance test of\nthe factor levels but also gives a prediction model for the response\xe2\x80\x9d [21]. In addition to that, the\nuse of DoE also offers the reduction in the variability of the results that is of great interest in\nachieving a robust design [21].\nThe main objectives of DoE are to gain the maximum amount of knowledge with a minimum\nexpenditure of experimental efforts and hence reduce the total engineering or process cycle time\n[23]. The experiments can be investigated with regard to all possible combinations of a set of\ninputs factor (full factorial) or with a subset of all combinations (fractional factorial) [21]. On top\nof that, the DoE is also used effectively in regression modeling [24].\nThe method is usually presented as an orthogonal array, which size is depending on the number\nof factors (also called the control variables) that are being considered and their factor levels.\n\xe2\x80\x98Orthogonal\xe2\x80\x99 means that all the trial conditions are balanced (the levels of all factors and the\ncombinations of all factors appear in equal number) and the effects of each control variable is not\nmixed or confounded with each other. This means that the effect of each factor can be separated\nfrom that of others as it is assumed initially that all the factor columns are not interacting with\neach other.\nThe general DoE array is depicted in Table XII. This example represents an experiment with 8\n(A-H) variables, 2 (A-B) resulting parameters, and n number of cases. As depicted in Table XII,\ntwo levels are set for each variable, namely 1 or 0. In this specific case, a 1 is portrayed as an\n\xe2\x80\x98on\xe2\x80\x99 setting and a 0 represents an \xe2\x80\x98off\xe2\x80\x99 setting.\nTable XII: General DoE Array\n\nCase\nNumber\n\n1\n2\n3\n\xe2\x80\xa6\nn-2\nn-1\nn\n\nXA\n1\n1\n0\n0/1\n0\n1\n0\n\nXB\n1\n1\n0\n0/1\n1\n0\n0\n\nControl Variables\nXC XD XE XF\n1\n1\n1\n1\n0\n0\n1\n1\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0/1 0/1 0/1 0/1\n0\n1\n0\n1\n1\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\nPage 40\n\nXG XH\n1\n1\n0\n0\n1\n1\n0/1 0/1\n0\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0\n\nResults\nYA\nYB\nYA1\nYB1\nYA2\nYB2\nYA3\nYB3\nYA\xe2\x80\xa6 YB\xe2\x80\xa6\nYAn-2 YBn-2\nYAn-1 YBn-1\nYAn\nYBn\n\nDeliverable #5 \xe2\x80\x93 Complete Report\nAs been mentioned earlier, the size of the orthogonal array will depend on the numbers of the\ndesign variables under consideration. After selecting the control variables that need to be\nconsidered, a standard orthogonal array will be chosen based on the amount of the variables and\ntheir levels.\nA general symbol for an orthogonal array, as first conceived by Euler, is given by [21]:\nL N (L M),\nwhere:\nN: number of trial conditions\nL: number of factor levels\nM: number of factors\nWith regards to the design problem at hand, there are 15 design parameters that have to be\nconsidered and assessed to see their contribution in achieving the design goals. If a traditional\napproach of changing one variable at a time is to be utilized, the contribution of each of the 15\nvariables may not be thoroughly investigated since the effects from a few dominant parameters\nwill overshadow the effects from the less dominant ones. The process also will consume more\ntime as there are many combinations of trials that might need to be done until the optimized\ncondition occurred. The output of the traditional approach will be an optimized condition of\nfactor level combination, which is not of primary objective here since this step of the design\nproject is more interested in finding the relationship between the variables and the desired design\ncharacteristics in order to have good understanding of the system.\nOn the other hand, by utilizing the DoE techniques, each and every contribution from these 15\nvariables can be investigated rather efficiently. The use of an orthogonal array, which in its\nprimary principle that the trial conditions are designed in such a way that the effects of the\nparameters are not mixed and confounded with each other, will help to determine the dominant\nfactors that contribute towards the design characteristics that are desired. Furthermore, the\napproach offers a better structured trial conditions that can allow good investigation on each of\nthe design variables contribution towards the design characteristics of interest, with a minimum\ntime and effort. Instead of just an optimized combination output, the DoE results sets of output\ndata. These sets of output response data information could then be further used in constructing a\nregressed relationship equation between the variables and the responses that provides a mean of\ngaining knowledge about the system.\nRegression Analysis\n\nRegression analysis in general is a method of developing the best estimate of relationship\nbetween dependent variables and the independent variables [22]. This method tries to establish a\n\xe2\x80\x98fitted equation\xe2\x80\x99 that could explain the behavioral pattern of the data set in relation to its\nindependent variables or contributing parameters.\nA measure of how well the equation predicts the relationship between the response and its\ncontributing factors is the coefficient of determination (R2). The R2 value \xe2\x80\x9chas an interpretation\nas a fraction of the raw variation in y accounted for using the fitted equation\xe2\x80\x9d [25], where \xe2\x80\x98y\xe2\x80\x99\nPage 41\n\nDeliverable #5 \xe2\x80\x93 Complete Report\nhere corresponds to the actual value of the response. In other words, the value tells how close the\nprediction equation captures the behavioral relationship pattern between the independent and\ndependent variables.\nThe value for R2 is computed using the equation 4 [25].\nR\n\n2\n\n\xe2\x88\x91(y\n=\n\ni\n\n\xcb\x86\n\xe2\x88\x92 y) 2 \xe2\x88\x92 \xe2\x88\x91 ( yi \xe2\x88\x92 y i ) 2\n\n\xe2\x88\x91 ( yi \xe2\x88\x92 y) 2\n\nEqn. (4)\n\nwhere: y i is the actual ith value of the response\ny is the sample mean\n\xcb\x86\ny i is the predicted ith value from the fitted equation\n\nAs a reference, consider an R2 of 0.9. This value indicates that 90% of the variability in the data\nis accounted by the model or the fitted equation. Depending on the experiment, accuracy\nrequired, and trueness of the data a \xe2\x80\x98good\xe2\x80\x99 R2 can be defined.\nThe difference between the actual response value and the predicted value for each data point is\ncalled the residual (e). The residual values describe the error in the fit of the model at each pair\ndata points (actual and predicted). The smaller the value of the residual means the better the fit of\nthe prediction equation at that particular data point.\nThe value for the residual for the ith point is given by equation 5 [25].\n\xcb\x86\nei = y i \xe2\x88\x92 y i\n\nEqn.

In order to obtain\nthe RSEs, the Response Surface Methodology (RSM) is used. The RSM is utilized \xe2\x80\x9cto gain a\nbetter understanding of the overall response system\xe2\x80\x9d [23] and is modeled \xe2\x80\x9cbased on the DoE\nmethodology\xe2\x80\x9d [23].\nRSMs also act as the link between the DoE and the regression analysis, where this methodology\nprovides \xe2\x80\x9ca multivariate regression technique developed to model the response of a complex\nsystem using a simplified equation\xe2\x80\x9d for which the regression data is gained from the DoE\ntechniques [23]. The data results from the DoE analysis are \xe2\x80\x9canalyzed by using the regression\nanalysis techniques to determine the output response surface as a function of the input variables\xe2\x80\x9d\n[21]. As briefly mentioned before, the regression analysis is a method to fit an equation in\n\nPage 42\n\nDeliverable #5 \xe2\x80\x93 Complete Report\nestablishing the relationship between the inputs and the outputs or the responses. With regards to\nthe design problem at hand, the relationship will be between one dependent variable (design\ncharacteristics of interest) and multiple independent variables of the selected design parameters.\nThis is an obvious multiple linear regression case.\nThe responses from the DoE with each different factor level combinations are modeled by a\n\xe2\x80\x98fitted equation\xe2\x80\x99 using the least squares method. This equation usually takes the form of a\nsecond-order quadratic equation after higher order terms are removed from the Taylor expansion.\nThe general form of the equation is given in equation 5 [23].\nk\n\nk\n\ni =1\n\ni =1\n\nk \xe2\x88\x921\n\nR = b0 + \xe2\x88\x91 bi k i + \xe2\x88\x91 bii k i2 + \xe2\x88\x91\n\nk\n\n\xe2\x88\x91b k k\nij\n\ni\n\nj\n\nEqn. (6)\n\ni =1 j = i +1\n\nwhere: b i are the regression coefficients for the first-degree terms\nb ii are the coefficients for the pure quadratic terms\nb ij are the coefficients for the cross-product terms\nk i , j are the design variables\nk i k j represent the interactions between design variables\n\nWith the help of computer program such as JMP, the RSEs can be obtained from the software\nwithout the normal hands-on mathematical manipulation of the least square regression method.\nCreation of Response Surface Equations\n\nAs a preliminary step, one must identify the design variables and the metrics for which the RSEs\nare desired. With these set, a screening test can be performed to reduce the number of design\nvariables to be studied. This is done in order to only have variables that significantly influence\nthe outcome metrics. With the final variables (including study ranges) and metrics identified, a\nDoE suitable for the model at hand must be created. It is necessary to have a full understanding\nof the model and a good understanding of the variables affecting the outcome in order to create\nthe correct DoE. The DoE is created using JMP by selecting the \xe2\x80\x98Response Surface Design\xe2\x80\x99 tab\nin the main DoE window. The number of variables desired to study is entered and then the user\nmust select what kind of DoE to use. When all the desired options are selected, a table with the\nDoE opens. The table is copied to excel to convert the 1s, -1s, and 0s to real numbers to linearly\nmatch the ranges with 1 being the high limit and -1 being the low limit. The real numbers are\nsaved into a table, which is used to create input files for FLOPS. A script can be written to speed\nthis process as well as to run all the input files thought FLOPS. Another script can be used to\nextract the data (metrics) from the output files. The data then needs to be copied to JMP into\ncolumns dedicated to the design metrics.\nThe initial model then is created by selecting the design variables and selecting \xe2\x80\x98Response\nSurface\xe2\x80\x99. Other options are available that need to be taken in consideration depending on the\nstudy. This process fits the model and a window opens up with the responses for each metric\nanalyzed. Each metric can be predicted by selecting the \xe2\x80\x98Prediction Formula\xe2\x80\x99 option for each\nPage 43\n\nDeliverable #5 \xe2\x80\x93 Complete Report\nfitted metric. Then the error of the FLOPS output and the RSEs predicted value can be calculated\nin a new column for each metric. With all these done, the goodness of the model can be\nobserved.\nThere are five good means of evaluation to see whether the wellness fit of the RSE to the actual\ncondition. They are the plot of predicted values against the actual values, the residual plot, the\nerror distribution plot, the value of the coefficient of determination (R2) and the confirmation\ntest. The plot of actual responses against the predicted responses (whole model test) from the\nfitted RSE can show a good indication whether that predicted equation gives the right\nrelationship between the variables and the responses. The equation is a bad interpretation of the\nrelationship if the actual data points deviate far from the perfect fit line. In addition to that, the\n95% confidence line may be added to the plot such that a good prediction line will have the\nconfidence lines wrap tightly around it. The residual plot is the plot of error term with respect to\neach pair of data points (actual and predicted responses for each inputs set). A good fit line will\nhave a random \xe2\x80\x98gunshots\xe2\x80\x99 residual plot without any visible or obvious pattern of residual values\ntrend. In addition to that, a good measurement of a fit line is that the residual value is less than\n1% of the data value, with small absolute range of the plot to the magnitude of the response. The\nthird evaluation of a fit is the error distribution. A good fit line should be normally distributed\nwith a zero mean and a standard deviation of less than one. Any error distribution that is far\ndeviate from a normal distribution indicates inaccurate fitted equation. Another means for\nevaluating a fit is the coefficient of determination (R2), which indicates how well the equation\npredicts the relationship between the response and its contributing factors. The value indicates\nthe amount of the variability in the data is accounted by the model or the fitted equation. A\nperfect fit will have a R2 of one and acceptable range for certification of a good fit would be\naround 0.99 and above. The final test for \xe2\x80\x9cgoodness\xe2\x80\x9d of a fit is a confirmation test is done by\ntaking random points within the variable range apart from those considered while doing the\nregression analysis and see whether the fitted equation corresponds well to the actual responses\nof these cases. A good fitted equation will derive small residual values between the actual and\npredicted responses. To get these random points, FLOPS needs to be run again with the\nconverted random numbers to real numbers and then the error is calculated.\nIn the case one or more of these methods for evaluating the goodness of fit fail, four procedures\ncan be considered. Namely, these are the exclusion of cases used to fit the model, the addition of\nhigher order terms to the fitted model, the transformation of a variable, and the selection of a\nnew set of ranges for the design variables. The exclusion of points can be done by selecting the\npoints whose residual is higher that most other cases. There is a maximum of about 3% of cases\nthat can be excluded and still obtain an acceptable fit. To check for the need of higher order\nterms, the influence of each design variable is checked. If needed, combination of the variables\nthat largely influence the result should be used to create higher order terms and refit the model.\nThe third possibility is the transformation of metrics. For example, instead of using a metric as\noutputted by FLOPS, it is sometimes useful to use the natural log of it to fit the model, or another\ntransformation that might improve the accuracy of the model and reduce the residual error and\nerror distribution. This can easily be done by refitting the model using the transformed metric\ninstead of the regular metric. A final, and least desired, procedure for improving the goodness of\nthe model is to establish different ranges and repeat the entire process of running FLOPS and\nfitting the model.\n\nPage 44\n\nDeliverable #5 \xe2\x80\x93 Complete Report\n\nAfter performing all the goodness tests and improving the goodness using the four described\nmethods above, the prediction formulas of the final fitted model can be added to the JMP sheet in\nthe corresponding columns and by double clicking in the corresponding columns the contribution\nof each variable and each interaction can be observed. These are the final RSEs of the metrics.\nDoE Used to Describe the 150 Passenger Aircraft Parameters\n\nFor the design task in hand, with the 15 variables need to be considered, there are three proposed\ngood optional DoE types that can be used, which are the Full Factorial, Central Composite\nDesign and the D-Optimal Design [23]. Since the orthogonal designs are of great importance to\nensure that the effects of each variable are not mixed and not confounded with each other, the DOptimal Design is not a good choice of DoE for this project. The Full Factorial, although it will\nprovide a more comprehensive knowledge about the system responses, is subjected to a large\namount of trials and will consumed a lot of time and effort. Therefore, the Central Composite\nDesign (a type of fractional factorial DoE) is chosen as the DoE type to be used in assessing the\nsystem, as the number of trials needed to be run is very much reduced from that of the Full\nFactorial, but at the expense of decreasing the orthogonal effect of the process and reducing the\namount information gained.\nThe Central Composite Design (CCD) is a type of DoE that includes the investigation on every\nend-point level and the center points of the interested design space. In addition to that, the\nresponses at the \xe2\x80\x98star points\xe2\x80\x99 are also included. The \xe2\x80\x98star\xe2\x80\x99 or the axial points are added to the\ntrials combination to provide additional information about the system response. These additional\npoints can be fixed at any location on the design space, even can be stretched out to the outside\nof the interested \xe2\x80\x98design space box\xe2\x80\x99. For this project, the axial points are located on the face of\nthe \xe2\x80\x98box\xe2\x80\x99 as the information gained from that responses will be more appropriate in assessing the\nrelationship within the \xe2\x80\x98box\xe2\x80\x99, as intended in this project. This type of CCD is called the \xe2\x80\x98facecentered CCD\xe2\x80\x99 and is depicted in Figure 28 [26].\n\nFigure 28: Face-Centered Central Composite Design\n\nThe CCD is an \xe2\x80\x9cefficient test approach to determine the coefficients of a second-degree\npolynomial\xe2\x80\x9d since it also includes the \xe2\x80\x9cadditional levels of variables between the end-point\nlevels\xe2\x80\x9d [21]. This criterion is very much of great preference to the team as the RSE is intended to\nbe in the second-order quadratic equation. Furthermore, the CCD can be made as a uniform\nprecision design, which requires the variance of the response at the origin and that at a unit\n\nPage 45\n\nDeliverable #5 \xe2\x80\x93 Complete Report\ndistance from the origin to be equal, by using a proper number of center points [21]. In this case,\nfor the CCD utilized in the project, all the center points are being considered and thus making the\nregression analysis has the edge of a uniform precision design, which is essential since \xe2\x80\x9cit gives\nmore protection against bias in the regression coefficients because of the presence of thirddegree and higher terms in the true surface) than does the orthogonal design\xe2\x80\x9d [21]. Thus, the\nchoice to use a CCD type of DoE is well justified.\nFor the purpose of this study, more specifically a 15 variable Oliver Bandte CCD with resolution\nIV fractional factorial design will be used. The reason is that JMP can only create an 8 variable\nRSE and the custom design created by Dr. Bandte can deal with up to 16 variables.\nCreation of RSEs of the Metrics for the 150 Passenger Aircraft\n\nThe DoE needed for this study was a 15 variable handmade design created by Dr. Oliver Bandte,\nas previously mentioned. A total of 287 cases are included in this specific design. After opening\nthe design, the table was copied to a excel spreadsheet that converts the 1s, -1s, and 0s to real\nnumbers depending on the ranges listed in Table I. The created table file (doe.table) was used\nalong a script to create 287 FLOPS input files. Then a script to run FLOPS for each created input\nfile was modified for the correct purpose and run. This script produced 287 FLOPS output files.\nTo extract the metrics of each output file, another script was modified correcting which metrics\nto extract and was run. This process created two files, one containing the performance metrics\nand another one containing the economic metrics.\nThe files were modified and the data was placed in the JMP file containing the DoE. At this\npoint, the JMP document contained the values (1s, -1s, and 0s) for the design variables and the\nmetrics of importance for each case. Then the model was fitted selecting the 15 variables and the\n12 responses. The variables were selected under the \xe2\x80\x98Response Surface\xe2\x80\x99 option and set as the\n\xe2\x80\x98Model Effect\xe2\x80\x99. The responses were set as the \xe2\x80\x98Role Variables\xe2\x80\x99. Also, the \xe2\x80\x98Center Polynomial\xe2\x80\x99\noption was unselected. To finish the set-up, the model was run.\nThe \xe2\x80\x9cgoodness\xe2\x80\x9d of the fit was then evaluated. From the resulting analysis, the actual vs.\npredicted and residual plots were observed. These did not show a nearly perfect fit as desired.\nBefore any conclusions, the predicted formulae were saved and the percent error for each case\nwas calculated using equation 7 below,\nerror =\n\npredictedValue \xe2\x88\x92 actualvalue\n* 100\nactualvalue\n\nEqn. (7)\n\nwhere the predicted value is the calculated value from the RSE and the actual value is the value\ncalculated by FLOPS. The error distribution for each metric was plotted and the group noted\nthat the distribution of error was not as desired for all of the metrics, especially for NOx,\nCO2/ASM, and take-off field length. To obtain valid RSEs, the mean of the error must be\naround zero and the standard deviation must be close to 1 or less. The next evaluation was the\nR2 check. All the fits were more than 99% correct, but as previously stated, this does not mean\nthat the RSEs are valid for the study. The final test to observe the validity of the RSEs created\nwas to run some random cases in FLOPS and observe the error distribution using the current\nPage 46\n\nDeliverable #5 \xe2\x80\x93 Complete Report\nRSEs. This was performed in a similar manner as the regular cases, except that instead of\ngenerating the real numbers with 1s, -1s and 0s, the real numbers were generated using any\nrandom number between 1 and -1 for each single variable for each of the 287 cases. These cases\nwere analyzed and the output was entered into JMP. It was found that the error distribution\nbeyond acceptable limits.\nFrom the five tests performed for each one of the metrics, it was concluded at this point that the\nmodel was not accurate. To get a more accurate model, NOx was transformed to LN NOx, some\ncases that were believed to be producing biased or incorrect responses were excluded, and higher\norder effects were included.\nThe third order effects included were considered by observing the individual effects of the\nvariables in each of the responses, and also by observing the contribution of interactions of the\nvariables to the responses. All the new interactions were included in a new fitted model for\nwhich some random cases had to be added in order to observe their effect. From this new fitted\nmodel the higher order interactions that influenced the responses were chosen.\nTable XIII lists the higher order interactions that were concluded to be influencing the responses\nand the excluded cases believed to be causing biased errors.\nTable XIII: Higher Order Interactions and Excluded Cases\nHigher Order Interactions\nAR3\nSW3\nTWR3\nTOC(1)3\nTOC(3)3\nSW2 TOC(1)\nSW2 TOC(3)\nAR2 TOC(1)\nAR2 TOC(3)\nAR2 SW\nSW2 AR\n\nExcluded Cases\n45\n46\n61\n62\n109\n125\n126\n257\n258\n261\n262\n\nWith these higher order interactions, excluded cases, and previous conclusion of using the\nnatural log of NOx a new model was fitted in the same manner as before. For confirmation and\nvalidating the RSEs, the same five tests were performed for each metric as previously done.\nThe summary of fit of each one of the metrics studied is displayed in Appendix B \xe2\x80\x93 Goodness of\nFit for Metrics. Each figure contains four quadrants. The first one is the actual versus predicted\nplot, the second one is the residual plot, the third quadrant contains the error distribution of the\nactual minus the predicted, and the fourth quadrant summarized the R2 value of the fit. All of the\nmetrics show a good fit.\n\nPage 47\n\nDeliverable #5 \xe2\x80\x93 Complete Report\nAppendix B \xe2\x80\x93 Goodness of Fit for Metrics also contains the error distributions for the random\ncases studied in this project. As expected, the error in random cases is larger than that for the\nDoE cases. The diagram in the appendix shows that there is a maximum error of about 3 percent\nfor the random cases. All the metrics, except for NOx and Wing Aerial Weight have standard\ndeviations below 1, meaning the error is normally distributed. NOx has a standard deviation of\n1.37 and Wing Aerial Weight has a standard deviation of 1.17. Both are higher than one, but still\nsince they have a very small maximum error (about 4 percent), the fits are considered good.\nFrom the observations of the tests performed to evaluate the goodness of the fits, it is suitable to\nconclude that the created RSEs represent a good model of the problem at hand. These RSEs can\npredict, within the specified ranges, the metrics to a high level of confidence. Appendix C \xe2\x80\x93\nDesign Space RSE Coefficients contains all the coefficients of the RSEs of the metrics here\nstudied.\nFigure 29, \xe2\x80\x98Prediction Profiles\xe2\x80\x99, shows the sensitivity of the responses to the design variables.\nThe left column represents all the responses, and the bottom row represents the design variables.\nIt is clearly shown that the wing area (SW) highly influences most of the responses, mainly the\napproach speed, the landing field length, the take off field length, and the wing aerial weight.\nThe figure indicates that as the wing area increase, these four decrease in magnitude. The reason\nis that a larger wing area produces more lift, which means that the aircraft can fly at lower speeds\nand still maintain control, that the aircraft needs less runway to takeoff, and less runway for\nlanding. The other two metrics noticeably affect by a change in wing are RDT&E costs and\nacquisition price. For these two, an increase in wing area indicates an increase in costs and price,\ndue to the fact that a larger wing area means more weight. Thrust to weight ratio seems to only\ninfluence the economic metrics. The prediction profile indicates that a higher thrust to weight\nratio increases all the economic metrics. The reason is that a higher thrust to weight ratio\nrequires a bigger engine (for this study), which as a result increases the weight of the aircraft,\nand all the economic metrics are based on weight. The final design parameter that heavily\ninfluences the metrics is aspect ration. An increase in aspect ratio indicates a decrease in landing\nand taking off field length, due to the fact that more lift is being created. Aspect ratio also\nheavily influences the emissions of carbon dioxide. The reason behind this is that a higher\naspect ratio creates more lift and less drag, thus reducing the amount of fuel burned by the engine\nthroughout the flight. All the other changes in design variables do not seem to highly influence\nthe metrics within the ranges being studied. This does not mean that the variables are not\nimportant, but just that variations of these variables within the established ranges do not alter the\noutcome of the metrics.\n\nPage 48\n\nDeliverable #5 \xe2\x80\x93 Complete Report\nPrediction Profiler\n\nVapp\n\n124.4\n109.4682\n\nLanding Length\n\n5327.39\n\nCO2/ASM\n\n5020.521\n\nTO Length\n\n99.5\n5754\n\n4581\n9033\n\n4143\n0.31162\n0.240344\n\nLog NOx\n\n0.20457\n6.50728\n6.019385\n5.78074\n\nTOGW\n\n160207\n148637.7\n141180\n\nACQ\n\n64.515\n60.10621\n57.33\n\nRDTE\n\n5124.94\n4790.337\n4583.62\n\nRPM\n\n0.13965\n0.134409\n\nTAROC\n\n0.13062\n7.141\n6.780006\n6.526\n\nDOC+I\n\n5.606\n5.305028\n5.093\n\nWAWt\n\n16.1851\n11.15928\n\nSW\n\nTWR\n\nAR\n\nTR\n\nTOC(1)\n\nTOC(3)\n\nSWEEP\n\nARHT\n\nTRHT\n\nTCHT\n\nSHT\n\nARVT\n\nTRVT\n\nTCVT\n\n-0.0132\n\n1\n\n1\n\n0.01721\n\n-1\n\n1\n\n0.00352\n\n-1\n\n1\n\n0.00106\n\n-1\n\n1\n\n-0.0042\n\n-1\n\n1\n\n-0.0031\n\n-1\n\n1\n\n-0.0063\n\n-1\n\n1\n\n0.01405\n\n-1\n\n1\n\n0.01568\n\n-1\n\n1\n\n-0.0385\n\n-1\n\n1\n\n-0.0072\n\n-1\n\n1\n\n0.00797\n\n-1\n\n1\n\n-0.0183\n\n-1\n\n1\n\n0.00203\n\n-1\n\n1\n\n0.01904\n\n-1\n\n-1\n\n8.51527\n\nSVT\n\nFigure 29: Prediction Profiles\n\nDETERMINE SYSTEM FEASIBILITY AND VIABILITY\nStep 5 in the TIES method is to determine if the conventional airplane configuration will qualify\nas a feasible and viable solution.

Two sets of goals were established for this study. One of the established goals is for\nthe year 2007 and the other one is for the year 2022. The first one, requires a 25 percent\nreduction in emissions and DOC+I. Figure 30 shows the design space available for the year\n2007 with the 25 percent reductions. Figure 31 contains the contour plot for the year 2022. Both\nof these plots show that there is not feasible space with the current design. In order to meet these\nconstraints, the requirements would have to be relaxed or if that is not possible technology would\nbe implemented. If the requirements were to be relaxed, the minimum values would be 0.21\nlb/ASM of CO2/ASM, 300 lb of NOx (5.7 in a natural log scale), and 5.15 cents/ASM for\nDOC+I. If the constraints are not meet, then heavy penalties would be given to the airlines, and\neven worse less aircraft would be sold since the aircraft would not meet the requirements\nspecified by law.\nContour Profiler\nHoriz Vert\n\nFactor\nSW\nTWR\nAR\nTR\nTOC(1)\nTOC(3)\nSWEEP\nARHT\nTRHT\nTCHT\nSHT\nARVT\nTRVT\nTCVT\nSVT\n\nCurrent Y\n\nLo Limit\n\nHi Limit\n\nVapp\n111.95 109.46818\nLanding Length\n5167.5\n5020.521\nTO Length\n6588 5327.3899\nCO2/ASM\n0.258092 0.2403437\nLog NOx\n6.1440106 6.0193847\nTOGW\n150693.4 148637.73\nACQ\n60.9225 60.106213\nRDTE\n4854.2795 4790.3373\nRPM\n0.135135 0.1344092\nTAROC\n6.8335 6.7800062\nDOC+I\n5.3495 5.3050282\nWAWt\n12.350183 11.159275\n1\n\nResponse\n\nCurrent X\n0.0190365\n0.0020266\n-0.018339\n0.0079734\n-0.007176\n-0.038505\n0.0156811\n0.0140532\n-0.006279\n-0.00309\n-0.004153\n0.0010631\n0.0035216\n0.0172093\n-0.013189\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n.\n.\n.\n0.185\n5.83\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n3.959\n.\n\nCO2/ASM\nWAWt\n\nContour\n\nLanding Length\nVapp\nTOGW\n\nTWR\n\nDOC+I\nTAROC\nRDTE\nACQ\nRPM\n\n-1\n\nTO Length\n\n-1\n\nSW\n\n1\n\nFigure 30: Contour Plot for Constraints for 2007\n\nPage 51\n\nDeliverable #5 \xe2\x80\x93 Complete Report\nContour Profiler\nHoriz Vert\n\nFactor\nSW\nTWR\nAR\nTR\nTOC(1)\nTOC(3)\nSWEEP\nARHT\nTRHT\nTCHT\nSHT\nARVT\nTRVT\nTCVT\nSVT\n\nCurrent Y\n\nLo Limit\n\nHi Limit\n\nVapp\n111.95 109.46818\nLanding Length\n5167.5 5020.521\nTO Length\n6588 5327.3899\nCO2/ASM\n0.258092 0.2403437\nLog NOx\n6.1440106 6.0193847\nTOGW\n150693.4 148637.73\nACQ\n60.9225 60.106213\nRDTE\n4854.2795 4790.3373\nRPM\n0.135135 0.1344092\nTAROC\n6.8335 6.7800062\nDOC+I\n5.3495 5.3050282\nWAWt\n12.350183 11.159275\n1\n\nResponse\n\nCurrent X\n0.0190365\n0.0020266\n-0.018339\n0.0079734\n-0.007176\n-0.038505\n0.0156811\n0.0140532\n-0.006279\n-0.00309\n-0.004153\n0.0010631\n0.0035216\n0.0172093\n-0.013189\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n\n.\n.\n.\n0.123\n5.429\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n2.6395\n.\n\nCO2/ASM\nWAWt\n\nContour\n\nLanding Length\nVapp\nTOGW\n\nTWR\n\nDOC+I\nTAROC\nRDTE\nACQ\nRPM\n\n-1\n\nTO Length\n\n-1\n\nSW\n\n1\n\nFigure 31: Contour Plot for Constraints for 2022\nFeasibility\n\nWith the RSEs obtained from JMP, a Monte Carlo Simulation is performed on each one in order\nto observe the probability of achieving a specific value for the metrics based on the established\nranges.

There are four options: change the ranges and run the time consuming\nanalysis again, alter the baseline design configuration, relax the constraints, or infuse new\ntechnologies. Since the primary focus of this study is to evaluate new technologies to introduce\na feasible design space, the next step (that will be presented in the next deliverable), introduces\nnew technologies and then determines the impact each technology makes on the system.\nViability\n\nThe economic viability is determined by assuming operational scenarios that will affect the\neconomics of the operation of the airplane. Since the future of economy, or the economic\nuncertainty, of the United States is unknown, a Monte Carlo Simulation can model how well the\ndesigned system will survive in different economic crises. There are five different operational\nscenarios that were looked at when determining the viability of the optimized baseline airplane\nconfiguration:\n1. Isolation: The U.S. is isolated from the world where no international travel is allowed.\nThis has little impact on the economic mission, utilization, and load factor of the 150passenger vehicle since the market was determined to be domestic flights within the U.S.\nSince there will be no international flights, the load factors will decline on this type of\naircraft for those passengers that must fly to a city that has international connections.\nAlso, if the U.S. is in isolation, the economy will most likely be hurt. This will cause less\ncoach passengers to travel, so the load factor will decrease more than the first class load\nfactor.\n\nPage 57\n\nDeliverable #5 \xe2\x80\x93 Complete Report\n2. No International Oil Available: The U.S. must produce its own oil and thus fuel, this\nwould drastically increase the fuel cost and resulting in lower coach and first class load\nfactors.\n3. Reduced Production: The number of aircraft sold is reduced because a competitor\nreleased a superior product, causing a reduction in the quantity of aircraft produced. This\nresults in a loss for the manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s return on investment.\n4. Labor Unions Dissolve: Labor unions are abolished within the U.S. and the\nmanufacturing capability is lost, affecting the learning curves.\n5. Airline Re-regulation: The government imposes new pricing regulations to airlines and\nplaces fixed prices on certain city pairs, which affects the airline\xe2\x80\x99s return on investment\nas well as coach and first class load factors.\nEconomic Variables\nBy studying the operational scenarios, the economic variables that are affected were determined.\nThese include the utilization of the airplane, the production quantity, coach and first class\nloading factors, airline and manufacturing ROIs, fuel cost, the manufacturing learning curves,\nand the economic stage length. Ranges for each of these variables were determined based on the\nimpact the operational scenarios would have. A summary of the baseline values and the ranges\ndetermined is listed in Table XVIII.\nTable XVIII: Economic Variables and Ranges\n\nName\nUtilization\nProduction Quantity\nCoach Load Factor\nFirst Class Load Factor\nAirline Return on Investment\nManufacturer Return on Investment\nFuel Cost\nManufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s Learning Curve\n\nEconomic Range\n\nALCCA\nVariable Name\nU\nNV\nCLF\nFLF\nRTRTNA\nRTRTN\nCOFL\nLEARN1\nLEARN2\nLEARNA1\nLEARNA2\nLEARNAS1\nLEARNAS2\nLEARNFE1\nLEARNFE2\nSL\n\nBaseline\nValue\n3900\n800\n0.71\n0.71\n10\n12\n0.7\n81.5\n85.0\n81.5\n85.0\n76.0\n79.0\n82.0\n85.0\n1000\n\nMin.\nLimit\n3500\n640\n0.55\n0.55\n7\n8\n0.63\n79.5\n83.0\n79.5\n83.0\n74.0\n77.0\n80.0\n83.0\n800\n\nMax.\nLimit\n4300\n1040\n0.8\n0.8\n13\n15\n2\n83.5\n87.0\n83.5\n87.0\n78.0\n81.0\n84.0\n87.0\n1200\n\nUnits\nHrs.\nunits\n%\n%\n%\n%\n$/gal\n%\n%\n%\n%\n%\n%\n%\n%\nnm\n\nUtilization is the amount of block time, in hours, which the aircraft can be operated. This\nincludes the daily operational availability, the mean time to repair (MTTR), and the mean time\nbetween failures (MTBF). A ten percent increase and decrease was used for the ranges of\nutilization. Isolation, having no international oil, and airline re-regulation will affect the amount\nthe airplane needs to be used because people will travel less.\nPage 58\n\nDeliverable #5 \xe2\x80\x93 Complete Report\nThe Production quantity is the number of operational vehicles demanded, including one flight\ntest vehicle. This could happen when a competitor releases an aircraft that is superior. More\nairlines will buy the competitor\xe2\x80\x99s aircraft and thus the production quantity will be reduced. The\nminimum range was a reduction of 20% from 800 aircraft produced. An upper limit was an\nincrease by 30%.\nThe coach and first class load factors are the percentage of passengers that will occupy the\nairplane compared to the total capacity. The baselines for each of these factors are 71%. In the\npossibility of isolation, no international oil available, or airline re-regulation less passengers will\nbe willing to travel. To determine the effects of reduced load factors, a minimal range for both\ncoach and first class was a reduction of about 20%. To look at the other end of the spectrum, and\nupper limit with an increase of about nine percent was used.\nThe Return on investment for both the airline and manufacturer could be disturbed with\neconomic uncertainty. The airline baseline ROI is 10%. A range of plus and minus 3% was\nused to determine the effect of airline re-regulation. The manufacturer ROI would be greatly\naffected in the case of a reduced production quantity. To model this effect, a decrease of four\npercent from 12% was used as a lower limit.\nIn the case where no international oil is available, fuel cost will be greatly affected. The U.S.\nwill be forced to produce its own fuel of U.S. oil reserves. The baseline cost of fuel is $0.7 per\ngallon. With a crisis, an increase in fuel cost could be up to $2 per gallon.\nIn the case where labor unions are dissolved in the U.S., the manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s learning curves\nwould be impacted. A range of plus and minus two percent was used for each of the following\nlearning curves:\nLEARN1: Airframe Learning Curve Factor for first lot\nLEARN2: Airframe Learning Curve Factor for second lot\nLEARNA1: Avionics Learning Curve Factor for first lot\nLEARNA2: Avionics Learning Curve Factor for second lot\nLEARNAS1: Assembly Learning Curve Factor for first lot\nLEARNAS2: Assembly Learning Curve Factor for second lot\nLEARNFE1: Fixed Eq. Learning Curve Factor for first lot\nLEARNFE2: Fixed Eq. Learning Curve Factor for second lot\nIf a labor union is dissolved, a labor union will not be enforcing manufacturing quality and\nworkers will take a longer time to become good at what they do.\nThe economic range is the average trip length in nautical miles. If the U.S. becomes isolated\nfrom the world, the range of a 150-passenger airplane would not be significantly impacted\nbecause the market is aimed at domestic U.S. flights only.\nResponse Surface Equation for Economic Metrics\nThe variables mentioned above will affect the economic metrics determined in the first step of\nthe TIES process. These are airplane acquisition price, RDT&E costs to the manufacturer,\nPage 59\n\nDeliverable #5 \xe2\x80\x93 Complete Report\naverage required yield per revenue passenger mile ($/RPM), the total airplane related operating\ncosts (TAROC), and the direct operating costs plus interest (DOC+I). With each of the variables\ntabulated into a 16 variable Doe, an RSE was created for the five response metrics. There were\nno higher order effects used in this RSE and all points were included for the fit. The goodness\ntests used to determine the \xe2\x80\x9cgoodness\xe2\x80\x9d of the RSE for each metric are displayed in Appendix D.\nAll of the actual versus predicted plots were very accurate. The residual plots, minus the\nRDT&E, resembled a gun shot, which represents a good fit. The RDT&E did not have a residual\nbecause the value varied only by thousandths of a million dollars between the different responses\nfor the DOE matrix. All of the errors displayed an error of less than 0.2% with a standard\ndeviation of under 0.2, which is very acceptable. All the R2 values resembled a \xe2\x80\x9cgood\xe2\x80\x9d fit. The\nfinal test was a random generation of cases within the ranges to evaluate the accuracy of the\nRSE. The results are located in Appendix D. All of the errors are under plus and minus one\npercent error, which verifies a good RSE model. The coefficients for the RSE are listed in E \xe2\x80\x93\nEconomic RSE Coefficients.\nThe Prediction Profiles shown in Figure 39 displays the sensitivity of the response to the design\nvariables. This shows that the coach load factor, fuel cost and stage length have the most effect\non the yield per RPM. The acquisition price is obviously influenced by the production number\nand the amount of ROI for the manufacturer. The RDT&E costs are directly related to the\nproduction number.

A triangular distribution was used for each of the variables with the apex of the\ntriangle at the baseline value. This allows for a minimum and maximum value to be declared ,as\napposed to positive and negative infinity for a normal distribution.

This simulation was done in the same manner as\nbefore, using a Monte Carlo simulation to develop CDFs. The shape functions for each of the\nmetrics were a triangular distribution where the apex changed depending on the scenario.\n\nPage 62\n\nDeliverable #5 \xe2\x80\x93 Complete Report\nChanging the apex provided results of the extreme cases, which could be representative of\neconomic uncertainty.\nIn the case of U.S. isolation for the world, the 150 passenger aircraft would only slightly be\nimpacted. The only shape functions that were varied were both the coach and first class load\nfactors. The coach load factor would be impacted more than first class. If the U.S. were in\nisolation, the U.S. economy would most likely be affected. People traveling in the coach would\nbe less inclined to travel. The apex for the coach load factor was reduced to 0.63 instead of 0.71\nto account for this affect. The first class load factor would also be reduced only because there\nwould be no travel overseas. Those traveling coach are less affected by economic hardships and\nwould still be willing to travel, so the apex was shifted to 0.67 from 0.71 to account for this\nscenario. The new shape functions are in Table XX.\nTable XX: U.S. Isolation Scenario Shape Functions\nAssumption: Coach Load Factor\nTriangular Distribution:\nMinimum: 0.55\nMaximum: 0.80\nApex: 0.67\n\nAssumption: First Class Load Factor\nTriangular Distribution:\nMinimum: 0.55\nMaximum: 0.80\nApex: 0.63\n\nThe only metric that was changed in the case of U.S. isolation was the $/RPM. No PDFs nor\nCDFs are illustrated here since $/RPM is desired to be minimized with no quantitative constraint.\nIn the scenario where no international oil is available, the fuel cost, and coach and first class load\nfactors, would all be impacted. The shape functions used to describe this case were triangular\ndistributions with the apex for the load factors reduced to the minimum of 0.55 to demonstrate\nthe extreme case and the fuel cost set to 2.0 instead of 0.7 as displayed in Table XXI.\nTable XXI: No International Scenario Shape Functions\nAssumption: Coach Load Factor\nTriangular Distribution:\nMinimum: 0.55\nMaximum: 0.80\nApex: 0.55\n\nAssumption: First Class Load Factor\nTriangular Distribution:\nMinimum: 0.55\nMaximum: 0.80\nApex: 0.55\n\nAssumption: Fuel Cost\nTriangular Distribution:\nMinimum: 0.63\nMaximum: 2.00\nApex: 2.00\n\nThe metrics affected by no international oil are the $/RPM, TAROC, and the direct operating\ncost. The PDFs for these three metrics are displayed in Figure 42. The CDFs for DOC+I is\nshown in Figure 43. With no international oil, the constraints have a lower probability of being\nmet. The $/RPM, Acquisition Price, and TAROC were again omitted since the constraint is to\nbe minimized.\nPage 63\n\nDeliverable #5 \xe2\x80\x93 Complete Report\n\nForecast: $/RPM\n\nForecast: DOC+I\n\nForecast: TAROC\n\nFrequency Chart\n\n10,000 Trials\n\n9,970 Displayed\n\n10,000 Trials\n\n9,924 Displayed\n\n10,000 Trials\n\n.020\n\n198\n\n.022\n\n215\n\n.023\n\n229\n\n.015\n\n148.5\n\n.016\n\n161.2\n\n.017\n\n171.7\n\n.010\n\n99\n\n.011\n\n107.5\n\n.011\n\n114.5\n\n.005\n\n49.5\n\n.005\n\n53.75\n\n.006\n\n57.25\n\n0\n\n.000\n\n.000\n0.12\n\n0.14\n\n0.16\n\n0.17\n\n0.19\n\nFrequency Chart\n\nFrequency Chart\n\n9,865 Displayed\n\n0\n6.45\n\n6.94\n\n7.44\n\n7.93\n\n.000\n\n8.43\n\n0\n5.14\n\n$/RPM PDF\n\n5.57\n\n6.00\n\n6.43\n\n6.87\n\nDOC+I PDF\n\nTAROC PDF\n\nFigure 42: Probability Density Functions for No International Oil\n100%\n90%\n\nTriangular\nDistribution\n\n80%\n\nNo\nInternational\nOil\n\nPercent Viability\n\n70%\n60%\n\n2022\nConstraint\n\n50%\n\n2007\nConstraint\n\n40%\n30%\n20%\n10%\n0%\n2.00\n\n3.00\n\n4.00\n\n5.00\n\n6.00\n\n7.00\n\n8.00\n\nDOC+I (cents/ASM)\n\nFigure 43: Viability Study for DOC+I with No International Oil\n\nIf the number of aircraft produced would be decreased, the manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s return on investment\nwould reduce.

The basic implementation configuration of the system is\ndepicted in Figure 49 [28]. The utilization of this technology requires the use of actuators on\neach of the control surfaces, which are connected to the center APO analysis system that will\ncontrol the smooth, long-period excitation of the redundant control surfaces [28].\n\nFigure 49: Modified Transport Aircraft With APO Implementation\n\nThe concept behind the development of this technology is based on the knowledge that the\ndesign of an aircraft is usually made through compromising the performance of the design in the\nvarious mission flight conditions. The end output design may be shaped up to optimize the\nperformance in only one or two most important mission segments and thus the design will fare\nlower in the other flight conditions. Enabling the configuration of the aircraft (control surfaces)\nto change during flight as to suit the operation segments better will increase the aircraft\nperformance, which results in the reduction of drag forces subjected during flight [29].\nBy implementing this technology, the redundant, variable geometry of an aircraft can be\noptimized to reduce the drag during flight operation, which in turn will reduce the fuel\nconsumption of the installed engine [28]. This criterion will reduce the operating cost for the\nairlines and the operational emission level of the aircraft.\nThe development of this technology is already completed by NASA, through the Dryden Flight\nResearch Center in California, where the APO system has been tested on a modified L-1011\naircraft. The test has been a success and the results show a reduction of drag forces acting on the\naircraft [28]. Thus, the TRL level of 9 given for this technology is very much adequate in\nshowing its readiness availability to be applied.\n\nT2, T3, T4, T5: Stitched Resin-Film-Infusion (RFI) Composite\nThe current practice of manufacturing composite aircraft structures is by the lamination process,\nwhich lacks the confidence of the industry for wider implementation since the cost is high and\nthe structures have low damage tolerance. The stitched resin-film-infusion (RFI) composite is a\ntype of textile composites where the manufacturing process involves the stitching of the\nPage 69\n\nDeliverable #5 \xe2\x80\x93 Complete Report\ncomposite materials and the resin infusion process and this method will prevent delamination\n(separation of layers) to allow for full-span composite structures. This manufacturing process\nwill reduce the cost as compared to that of the current lamination process and the structures also\nhave higher damage tolerance barriers [30].\nThe stitched RFI process in more details includes the stitching of carbon fabric (pre-cut pieces of\nmaterial) performs at a closely spaced through-the-thickness as to provide the essential\nreinforcement for damage tolerance, which is then infused with resin film after being molded\nwith the outer mold line (OML) tool that shape the outside surface of the structure [30]. The\nsequence of the full process is shown in Figure 50 [30].\n\nThe composite\nmaterials are\nstitched.\n\nThe still flexible\nwing/tail panel is\nput into an OML,\nwhich is laid with\nresin, followed by\nthe tools that\ndefine the inner\nmold line.\n\nThese elements\nare put into a\nvacuum bag and\nplaced in an\nautoclave where\nheat and pressure\nare applied to let\nthe resin spread\nthroughout the\nstructure.\n\nAfter heating\nto 350\xc2\xb0C for 2\nhours, the\nwing/tail skin\npanel takes on\nits final\nhardened\nshape.\n\nFigure 50: The Stitched RFI Process\n\nThe stitched RFI composite structure for the wing and tail is preferred because the composite has\na lower weight than the commonly used aluminum alloys with comparable strength. The cost for\ncomposites also is very much lower than the metallic materials, which will reduce the production\ncosts and subsequently the operating costs to airlines [30]. In addition to that, this new stitched\nRFI composite has a high strength and the process enables \xe2\x80\x9cthe various elements of wing skin,\nstiffeners, ribs, and spars to be incorporated into an integral structure that would eliminate\nthousands of mechanical fasteners\xe2\x80\x9d [30].\nNASA in a partnership with the Boeing Company has developed this technology. The\ndemonstration of the performance of a 12-ft long \xe2\x80\x98wing stub box\xe2\x80\x99 at the NASA Langley\nResearch Center in July 1995 has been a success [30]. However, to build a real full-scale\nwing/tail structure will require an advanced stitching machine, which is still under the\ndevelopment by The Boeing Company [30]. Therefore, the TRL level of 4 is adequate since only\nan experimental model has being developed and tested in the laboratory environment.\n\nT6: Airframe Methods\nThe airframe methods technology is aimed to \xe2\x80\x9creduce the design cycle time by delivering\nintegrated design methodologies and new aerodynamic concepts\xe2\x80\x9d [31]. \xe2\x80\x9cThe future new aircraft\ndesigns require the ability to define, early in the design cycle, an optimized airframe structure,\xe2\x80\x9d\nwhich can be achieved through the use of computerized methods for structural analysis and\ndesign optimization [32]. \xe2\x80\x9cThese concepts and tools will enable revolutionary aircraft designs\nPage 70\n\nDeliverable #5 \xe2\x80\x93 Complete Report\nand faster design cycles while reducing aircraft operating costs, environmental impacts and\naircraft development risks\xe2\x80\x9d [31].\nAmong the airframe method tools that are being developed are [33]:\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nIntegrated Computational and Experimental Fluid Dynamics.\nTools for Rapid Design of Multipoint Wing (including the effects of PAI and yield\ntechnology).\nAnalysis Tools for Cost Effective Implementation of Advanced Low-Noise, High-Lift\nSystem Concepts and Yield.\n\nThe development of these methods will enable the reduction in the design cycle time, which will\nalso reduce the production costs, and the creation of an optimized airframe design that will\nreduce the drag forces subjected to the aircraft during flight and the emission level [33]. The\nreduction of drag forces also relates to the reduction of the fuel consumption by the engine.\nThese benefits are due to the fact that the methods will enable improvements on the airframe\ndesign as to suit the operational condition better and thus increase the performance.\nCurrently, NASA is developing these methods, which have achieved validated progress\ndemonstrations of improvements in the aircraft operating costs and design cycle time [31]. One\nof the successful demonstrated tools is the pressure-sensitive-paint system for use in wind tunnel\nresearch to improve the methods of designing a cruise wing configuration, by which the results\nof pressure data obtained aligned very well with the results from conventional computationalfluid-dynamics tools [31]. The TRL level given for this technology is 4 and it is justified since\nonly experimental results from a laboratory environment has been achieved at this point.\n\nT7: Fire Suppression\nFires and explosions are the major threat in the safety of the aircraft\xe2\x80\x99s operation. The fire\nsuppression system on an aircraft is to restrain fires that may break out in an engine. For the past\ndecades, the practice of fire suppression system for aircraft has utilized the halon 1301 (CF3Br)\nas the fire suppressant agent, which was banned from production as of January 1, 1994 by the\n1992 Copenhagen Amendments to the 1987 Montreal Protocol on Substances That Deplete the\nOzone Layer due to its high ozone-depleting potential (ODP) [34].\nThe technology search in the fire suppression system mainly involves the development of a new\nfire suppressant agent that would be of low mass and volume with comparable high fire\nsuppression efficiency performance to that of halon 1301 [34]. In addition to that, the new\nchemicals must also perform well with regard to the ozone-depletion potential (ODP), global\nwarming potential (GWP), atmospheric lifetime, re-ignition quenching, residue level, electrical\nconductivity, corrosity to metals, polymenic material compatibility, stability under long-term\nstorage, toxicity of the chemical and its combustion and decomposition products, speed of\ndispersion, and safety and occupational health requirements [34].\nCurrently, the largest development effort is done by the US Department of Defense (DoD)\nthrough the Next Generation Fire Suppression Technology Program (NGP) [34]. The European\nPage 71\n\nDeliverable #5 \xe2\x80\x93 Complete Report\nCommunity is also doing research through the FIREDETEX project, but in a smaller scale\ncompared to NGP [35]. The NGP program has resulted new fire suppression concepts, such as\nthe solid propellant gas generator (SPGG), and also a few potential alternatives to replace the\nhalon 1303 as the fire suppressant, which have been successfully verified in concept through\nlaboratory experiments [34]. The current TRL level assigned for this technology is 3 and this is\na fair indication of the technology development since the new concepts and alternatives have\nbeen proven conceptually.\n\nT8, T9: Low Cost Composite Manufacturing\nThe current manufacturing process of composite structures through lamination process is\nsubjected to a high manufacturing cost. Thus, in order to widen up the usage of the composites\non aircraft structures, new low cost composite manufacturing processes must be developed. The\ncomposite materials are preferred for aircraft structures because of the lighter weight and\ncomparable strength to metallic materials.\nThe technologies under consideration are basically the \xe2\x80\x9cdesign and analysis of manufacturing\nprocesses that will improve the performance and reduce fabrication cost of composite materials\xe2\x80\x9d\n[36]. These will include the utilization of \xe2\x80\x9cinnovative composite design technologies, materials\nand manufacturing processes\xe2\x80\x9d [37].\nAmong the processes that are being developed in lowering the cost of composite manufacturing\nare [36]:\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nDevelopment of science-based process simulation models\nUse of embedded sensors to monitor the process, to verify the process simulation models\nand for health monitoring\nComposite and matrix resin characterization\nNovel composite processing method\nCoupled thermal/structural analyses to minimize fabrication induced stresses\nDesign for manufacture with composite parts\nDesign of functionally graded and multifunctional composites\n\nThe modeling capability will enable the development of a more cost-effective, automated\ncomposite structures manufacturing. Obviously, the advantage of this technology will be the\nreduction of the production costs, and by allowing this to happen, an increase use of composite\nstructures on aircraft design will be able to be adopted. The use of composite structures will\nconsequently reduce the weight of the aircraft. Among the desirable process will be a 2-D\nbraiding technique associated with a low cost that will enable the creation of textile composites\nwith fibers placed in any direction [38].\nThe development of these technologies is still in the early phase, where various academic\ninstitutions like Cranfield University [39] and Virginia Tech [36], commercial companies such as\nBoeing and also the various government agencies are still developing the concepts of the\nmanufacturing process and tools without any full scale experiments being done yet. One of the\npotential manufacturing process tools that have been developed is the \xe2\x80\x9cRFI Process Modeling for\nPage 72\n\nDeliverable #5 \xe2\x80\x93 Complete Report\nLarge Transport Aircraft Composite Wing Structures\xe2\x80\x9d by the Virginia Tech Center for High\nPerformance Manufacturing, in which the development of a 3-D comprehensive simulation\nmodel of the RFI composite manufacturing process is done and verified [36]. The model has\nbeen adopted by the Boeing Company, which uses the simulation model in developing \xe2\x80\x9cthe cure\ncycle that resulted in complete resin infiltration and cure of a 42 foot long aircraft wing section\xe2\x80\x9d\n[36]. The TRL level for this technology is given as 2 and it is a fair indication since the concepts\nare still in the verification stage and need to be proven successful.\n\nT10: Propulsion System Health Management\nThe propulsion system health management technology is referring to a \xe2\x80\x9csmart self-diagnostic and\nprognostic propulsion system\xe2\x80\x9d, which will utilize \xe2\x80\x9cadvanced smart sensors integrated with onboard engine models and failure detection algorithms that will identify the direct cause for a\ncurrent or impending problem, allowing for timely maintenance action to be taken\xe2\x80\x9d [40]. In other\nwords, the management system will enable early detection of the propulsion system problem to\npermit prevention steps be taken before the total failure. The objectives of this technology are \xe2\x80\x9cto\ndevelop and validate propulsion system health monitoring technologies designed to prevent\nengine malfunctions from occurring in flight, and to mitigate detrimental effects in the event an\nin-flight malfunction does occur\xe2\x80\x9d [41]. The propulsion health management system functions are\nlisted in Table XXVII [40].\nTable XXVII: Propulsion Health Management System Functions\nSystem\n\nEngine\nInstrumentation\n\nHealth Monitoring\nAlgorithm\n\nAnomalies &\nDegradations\n\nFunctions\n\nEPR\nFuel Flow\nEGT\nRotor Speeds\nOil Temperature\nOil Pressure\nEngine Vibration\nCycle Counts\nGas Path Analysis\nTrend Monitoring\nSignal Processing\nNeural Networks\nExpert Systems\nStatistical Analysis\nSensor and Actuator Failures\nIncreased Tip Clearance\nBlade Fouling\nBlade Leading Edge Blunting\nFOD\nBearing Anomalies\nBlade Outs\nSeal Wear\nLubrication System Anomalies\n\nPage 73\n\nDeliverable #5 \xe2\x80\x93 Complete Report\nThe advantages from this technology are the reduction in maintenance time and costs and the\nreduction of fuel consumption that will reduce operating costs for airlines, plus the extending onwing life and increase the operational safety [40].\nThe development of this technology is still under the concept stage where experimental and\ndevelopment efforts are being done by NASA through collaborations with industry and academia\n[40]. The work done currently involve in the concept development of the \xe2\x80\x9cAutomated On-Line\nHealth Management and Data Analysis System\xe2\x80\x9d which in theory will enable online health\nmonitoring of the propulsion sub-systems and \xe2\x80\x9cinformation monitoring from many sources over\nlocal/wide area networks\xe2\x80\x9d [42]. The given TRL level for this technology is 2 and this is justified\nwith the current technology development, which is still in the concept generation and evaluation\nprocess.\n\nT11: Smart Nacelle \xe2\x80\x93PAI\nThe propulsion-airframe integration (PAI) technology involves the \xe2\x80\x9cdetermination of optimum\nnacelle placement and optimum shaping to both the nacelle and airframe to minimize drag\xe2\x80\x9d [43].\nThis method of integration is intended to be achieved through the use of advanced computational\nand experimental methods [43]. The simulation of PAI program is depicted in Figure 51 [43].\n\nFigure 51: Propulsion-Airframe Integration\n\nThe development of this technology also includes several advanced subsystems designs such as\n[44]:\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nValidated, rapid turnaround design tools\nActive flow control\nActive shape control\n\nThe advantages of this technology to the operation of the aircraft are the lower drag due to the\npropulsion system integration with the airframe, which will improve the aircraft performance and\nefficiency, plus the reduction in the fuel consumption and emissions levels [43].\nNASA has pursued the development of this technology through the Ultra Efficient Engine\nTechnology (UEET) program. Currently, some of the concepts developed for the smart\npropulsion-airframe integration methods have been fully developed but validity through\nPage 74\n\nDeliverable #5 \xe2\x80\x93 Complete Report\nexperimental sense has yet to be done. One of the methods developed under this program is the\n\xe2\x80\x9chighly efficient flow sensing and control system to eliminate adverse propulsion inlet/boundary\nlayer interactions in advanced PAI concepts\xe2\x80\x9d that helps to manage inlet flow fields [44]. The\nTRL level of 3 is therefore adequate to indicate the current development phase of this\ntechnology.\n\nT12, T13, T14, T15: Emerging Alloy Technology and Forming\nThe alloy technology that results in higher strength, higher operating temperature, lower\nmanufacturing and production costs and lighter weight material is always a benefit to the\naerospace industry. New alloys such as titanium alloy are being investigated for structural\napplication in the aerospace industry [38]. Apart from that, in much general basis, research has\nbeen done to result in better concepts of alloy materials for various uses in the industry. The\ncurrent most potential emerging alloy technologies for aircraft structures is the \xe2\x80\x98shape memory\xe2\x80\x99\nalloy.\n\xe2\x80\x9cShape Memory Alloys (SMA\'s) are novel materials, which have the ability to return to a\npredetermined shape when heated. When an SMA is cold, or below its transformation\ntemperature, it has a very low yield strength and can be deformed quite easily into any new shape\nthat it will retain. However, when the material is heated above its transformation temperature it\nundergoes a change in crystal structure, which causes it to return to its original shape. If the\nSMA encounters any resistance during this transformation, it can generate extremely large\nforces\xe2\x80\x9d [45]. \xe2\x80\x9cThe \xe2\x80\x98shape-memory\xe2\x80\x99 phenomenon relies on the existence of two stable\nmetallurgical phases and a reversible, temperature-dependent transformation between a hightemperature, high strength austenitic structure and a relatively weaker, highly twinned\nmartensite\xe2\x80\x9d [46]. This shape memory phenomenon is depicted in Figure 52 [46].\n\nFigure 52: The Shape-Memory Phenomenon\n\nThis alloy technology will enable the tail/wing structure to change shapes during flight as to\nobtain an optimal shape for various flight conditions. In addition to that, the use of this alloy\nmaterial will eliminate the use of hinge devices that are driven by hydraulic systems [47]. The\nbenefits for using this alloy technology are that there is a lighter structure weight and also a\nreduction in drag forces acting on the aircraft. A reduction in drag will reduce the fuel\n\nPage 75\n\nDeliverable #5 \xe2\x80\x93 Complete Report\nconsumption and therefore, the operating costs of the aircraft. The weight of the structure will\nreduce due to the fact that hydraulic systems that currently used to control the actuators for the\ncontrol surfaces will be eliminated [47].\nThe development of this technology is currently done by various commercial companies in the\nalloy and materials business such as the Advanced Metal Components Inc. of California [46],\nTiNi Alloy Company [45], and others. Currently, a few shape-memory alloys have been created\nsuch as the Tinel or Nitinol, which \xe2\x80\x9ccontains equal proportions of titanium and nickel, along with\na small amount of an undisclosed third element\xe2\x80\x9d [46]. However, these alloys have yet to be\ntested for aircraft structures implementation.\nIn implementing the new alloys on aircraft structures, they have to be compatible with the\nforming processes that are being utilized in the industry. Among the new forming technologies\nthat have been utilized in the aerospace industry are listed in Table XXVIII.\nTable XXVIII: Forming Technologies in Aerospace Industry\nForming Technology\n1. Spray Forming\n\n2. Guerin Forming or\nRubber Pad Forming.\n\n3. CAD-Driven Laser\nForming.\n\nDescription\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis technology uses very\nsmall, atomized droplets of\nmetallic alloys to produce\ncomponents that in many cases\nare stronger and tougher than\nthe traditionally produced\nparts\xe2\x80\x9d [48]. This technique is\nfound to reduce the cost and a\nmore reliable forming method.\n[48]\n\xe2\x80\x9cThis method involves high\npressure forming and utilizes a\nrubber pad inside a chamber to\napply pressure on metal blanks\nover tools. The pressure on the\nblanks forms them around the\ntools\xe2\x80\x9d [49]. This technique has\nbeen found to reduce the cycle\ntime, cost, and also has a high\nreliability [49].\nThe process involves \xe2\x80\x9cthe\nmethod\nof\nlayered\nmanufacturing, where complexshaped components are built\nupon layer without the need of\nexpensive tooling or operator\nintervention\xe2\x80\x9d\n[50].\nThis\nforming technology is found to\nreduce the cost by reducing the\ncycle time, materials used and\ninventory [16].\n\nPage 76\n\nStatus\nCurrently used in\nthe aircraft engine\nnickel\nand\nsuperalloys and\ndeveloped\nfor\nutilization\nfor\nstructures [48].\n\nproducing\nparts from\naluminum\nis being\nbigger\naircraft\n\nCurrently used for aluminum\nsheetmetal\nforming\nby\nBoeing\nCompany\nand\nMcDonnell-Douglas\nCompany [49].\n\nCurrently, this method is\nunder final implementation\nstage through the Dual Use\nScience and Technology (DU\nS&T) program by Naval Air\nSystems Command, Boeing\nand Northrup Grumman, for\ncommercial\naircraft\nmanufacturing\napplication\nand expected to be ready by\nthe year 2003 [16].\n\nDeliverable #5 \xe2\x80\x93 Complete Report\n\nThe TRL level given for the emerging alloys technology and forming is 3, which is a fair\nindication of the development level especially in the alloy technology development.\n\nT16, T17, T18: Superplastic Forming (SPF)\nSuperplasticity is \xe2\x80\x9cthe ability of a material to exhibit extreme tensile deformation (usually greater\nthan 1000% elongation) prior to failure\xe2\x80\x9d [51]. This criterion of material is very desirable in the\ndesign of an aircraft. Superplastic forming (SPF) process is defined as a \xe2\x80\x9cmetal forming process\nthat takes advantage of the high extendibility of certain materials in order to form components\nwhose shapes might be otherwise very difficult to obtain\xe2\x80\x9d [52].\n\xe2\x80\x9cDuring the SPF process, the superplastic material is heated to the SPF temperature within a\nsealed die. Pressure is then applied, forcing the material to take the shape of the die pattern. The\nflow stress of the material during deformation increases rapidly with increasing strain rate. Thus,\nthe ability to deform the material uniformly requires precise control of strain rate and strain rate\nsensitivity. Additional parameters requiring careful control include temperature, forming\npressure, and stress.\xe2\x80\x9d [53].\nThe SPF process enables the formation of unique, complex shapes and also the fabrication of\ncomponents from a single piece of material, which is one of the reasons for the increase in its\napplication [51]. In addition to that, this forming process also reduces the weight and the\nmanufacturing costs since the process eliminates parts and subsequent processing, as well as\nreducing the design cycle time [51].\nThe development of the SPF process is done by various research institutes and commercial\ncompanies such as Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory [51], Boeing Company, McDonnell\nDouglas Aerospace (MDA) Company and others [53]. Since the SPF forming process has been\nused in manufacturing of a few aircraft structures before, the concept of the process is already\nknown. However, there is still no experimental effort in forming the aircraft skin using the SPF\nmethod to prove whether the concept will work for this application. Thus, the current assigned\nTRL level of 2 for this technology is adequate.\n\nT19: Russian Aluminum Lithium Fuselage Skin\nThe advancement in the aluminum-lithium alloys, which high development work has been done\nby Russia, is of great interest to the industry. This type of material is preferred to the\nconventional aerospace materials because of the higher strength and lighter weight criteria [54].\nHowever, the use of this alloy has been limited due to the high manufacturing cost associated\nwith the forming process of the material.\nResearch has been done to develop new Al-Li alloys that can be easily formed and still maintain\nthe same attractive criteria of the strength and weight advantages. \xe2\x80\x9cResearch and development\nefforts in Russia and the United States have focused on advanced Al-Li alloys for aerospace\napplications where reduced structural weight is a critical goal\xe2\x80\x9d [55]. The Al-Li Alloy 1441, one\nof the latest of this alloy series, is currently used for fuselage applications on the Russian Be-103\nPage 77\n\nDeliverable #5 \xe2\x80\x93 Complete Report\namphibious aircraft [55]. This Al-Li alloy is \xe2\x80\x9ccold-rollable and has several attributes that make it\nattractive for fuselage skin applications\xe2\x80\x9d [55]. The advantages of this Russian Al-Li alloy are the\nbetter mechanical properties and strength with lower density than the conventional aluminum\nfuselage skin alloy, and the potential increase in the life of the fuselage structure with decreased\nstructural weight [55].\nThe development of this Al-Li alloy technology for the fuselage skin application has been done\nby NASA in collaboration with the All-Russia Institute of Aviation Materials (VIAM), Moscow,\nRussia [55]. Under this development program, a few new alloy series has been successfully\ndeveloped and tested in laboratory experiments, such as the Aluminum-Cuprum-Lithium alloys\n(1450,1460), Aluminum-Magnesium-Lithium alloys (1420,1424) and the Aluminum-CuprumMagnesium-Lithium alloys (1440,1441) [55]. Thus, the current TRL level of 4 is the right\nindication of the development phase for this technology development.\n\nT20: Adaptive Engine Control System\nThe adaptive engine control system (ADECS) is the technology that will enable the system to\nreduce the engine temperature (and pressure) while holding the engine thrust constant [56]. This\ntechnology will permit the control of engine condition as to change accordingly to suit the flight\nenvironment or condition. This function can be done by utilizing an automated control system,\nwhich includes a sensor system that can predict the fuel consumption of the engine, engine\npower output, and emissions level [57]. The benefits from this technology are the extension of\nthe engine life, the increase in thrust production by the engine and also the reduction in fuel\nconsumption and emissions level [56].\nThe development work on this technology is currently done by NASA, in collaboration with\nPratt & Whitney Company and also by various academia institutions [56]. To date, the\ntechnology concept has been successfully demonstrated by using the F-15 Highly Integrated\nDigital Electronic Control (HIDEC) aircraft [56]. The TRL given for this technology is 4, which\nindicates that the technology has been verified as successful in the laboratory environment\ntesting and since the demonstration of this technology is by implementation on a modified F-15\naircraft, which is totally different with the commercial transport aircraft, this level of TRL may\nbe taken as adequate reflection on the technology development.\n\nT21, T22, T23, T24: Revolutionary Metallic Materials Systems\nMetallic materials have been used for aerospace applications for a long time. In recent years,\ntechnology development of the metallic materials are being pursued in establishing new\nrevolutionary concepts of this materials for increased performance capability, especially in\nproducing lighter weight structures with comparable existing strength and increase in the\ndurability of the structure. The main goal of this technology is \xe2\x80\x9cto replace the discrete\nconventional materials/structures with continuous functionally-graded materials/structures in\napplications where extreme environment attenuation is critical\xe2\x80\x9d [58]. An example of this is the\nlow-carbon steel material, which is anticipated to be utilized for high impact structures and\ncorrosion resistance purposes [38].\n\nPage 78\n\nDeliverable #5 \xe2\x80\x93 Complete Report\nIn much general scope, this objective has leads to the research on new metallic materials on bioinspired product form, which includes the development processes of [58]:\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nsynthesize of new metallic material product forms, such as porous and direct deposited\nmetals\ndevelopment of processing methods and establishment of processing-structure-property\ncorrelations\ndevelopment of synergistic materials/structural methodology using physical models to\nlink structural functions to material properties\ndefinition of extreme environment combinations and associated system functional\ngradients\n\nSome of the new revolutionary metallic materials characteristics are nanostructured,\nfunctionalized, self-healing, and self-assembling [58]. The benefits from using this metallic\nmaterial technology are the reduction of the structural weight, reducing the maintenance and\nmanufacturing costs, and the increased life of the structures.\nThe work in developing this technology is being done by NASA, where concepts of the\nrevolutionary metallic materials are being generated and have yet to be proven feasible through\nexperimental efforts [58]. Thus, the TRL level of 2 is indicative of the current development\nphase for this technology.\n\nT25: Composite Fuselage Shell (Fuselage Skin)\nA composite fuselage shell technology is preferred to the current aluminum technology mainly\nbecause of its much lighter weight with comparable strength [59]. \xe2\x80\x9cThe composite sandwich\nstructures offer potential weight reduction by decreasing the number of frames by increasing the\nfuselage frame spacing\xe2\x80\x9d [60].\nThe composite fuselage shell will be basically made of similar structures of the current\naluminum applications but with stiffened and curved sandwich composites at interfaces with\ninternal structure members such as airframe stringers or flanges and areas of high stress\nconcentration [60]. With the fuselage skin also made of composites, there is a possibility of\nmechanical fastener reductions [32]. The advantage of this technology will mainly decrease the\nfuselage weight.\nThe development on this technology is currently pursued by EU community through the\nFUBACOMP program [32], and also NASA [59]. The concept of the composite fuselage shell\nand skin has been generated. Currently experiments and testing are being done to see the strength\nand applicability of the composite structure concept in aircraft fuselage application and has yet to\nproduce validation of the concept. Thus, the TRL level of 2 is appropriate to measure the\ndevelopment of this technology.\n\nPage 79\n\nDeliverable #5 \xe2\x80\x93 Complete Report\n\nT26: Living Aircraft\nLiving aircraft technology refers to an aircraft that can adapt efficiently to various mission\nfunctions in any given environment. The design of a living aircraft will utilize integrated\ntechnologies such as the morphing technology, adaptive control of lifting surfaces and\npropulsion system, shape memory metallic materials technology, and several others [61]. The\nmain objective of this technology is to enable the aircraft to mimic the nature function for any\nmission or flying environment [38].\nThe living aircraft is expected to have shape-changing structures beyond just the wing, such as\nchanging engine inlets to optimize air flows in different speeds or the contraction of the fuselage\nas fuel being burned [61]. The development of this technology basically revolves around the\nresearch to \xe2\x80\x9cdevelop and mature smart component technologies for advanced airframe systems,\nwhich are done in four key areas of computational materials, advanced piezoelectric materials,\nfiber optic sensing devices and integrated composite structures\xe2\x80\x9d[62]. The ability of the aircraft\nto adapt to different flight mission will give main advantages of lower drag forces, high\nutilization, and lower structural weight.\nThe development on this technology is currently done by DARPA, NASA, and The Boeing\nCompany [61, 62]. The concepts for this technology generated and evaluated without any\nexperimental verification as yet. Thus, the TRL level of 2 is a good reflection on the\ndevelopment level.\n\nT27, T28: Active Load Alleviation\nThe flutter effect in flight is commonly caused by the structural-mode response of the lifting\nsurfaces of an aircraft in correspond to the induced unsteady pressures application to the lifting\nsurfaces due to turbulent and separated flows during flight. This effect is called \xe2\x80\x98buffeting\xe2\x80\x99 and\nthe factor is called the \xe2\x80\x98buffet\xe2\x80\x99 [63].\nThe active load alleviation technology is aimed to reduce this effect, which will cause fatigue\ndamage to the aircraft structures. The technology development is focused on implementing an\nactive control system to the lifting surfaces as to reduce the buffet response and the consequent\nstructural dynamic response to the structures. The advantage of utilizing this technology will\nreduce the cost of redesigning processes and support cost since the fatigue damage can be\navoided or reduced [63].\nThe development on this technology has been pursued by the collaborative efforts from The\nBoeing Company, the Air Force Research Laboratory and NASA [30]. One of the successful\ndevelopments of the active load alleviation system concepts is the active control using \xe2\x80\x98smart\xe2\x80\x99\nmaterials (piezoelectric actuators) that is distributed over the structure, which has been tested\nsuccessfully on the vertical tail of F/A-18 aircraft with a reduction in the buffet response [63].\nThe current TRL level for this technology is given as 4 and it is adequate to the corresponding\ndevelopment of this technology.\n\nPage 80\n\nDeliverable #5 \xe2\x80\x93 Complete Report\n\nT29: Antenna Systems\nAntenna system is a compulsory system to be installed in all commercial airplanes as required by\nthe Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulations. This system, as much as its importance\nfor the communication operations, is making the aircraft subjected to more drag since the\nantenna is mounted on the airframe [64].\nThe development of technology in the antenna system is focused on eliminating the mounted\nantenna structure or equipment on the external aircraft surface as to reduce the drag forces. This\nmotive has spawned researches on making the aircraft skin to operate as an antenna instead of\nhaving another structure on the aircraft for the antenna system [65].\nThe advantages of this technology is clearly the reduction of the drag forces subjected to the\naircraft during flight, a much wider communication range and also a reduction in the equipment\nweight since the complex antenna equipments are being replaced by a thin \xe2\x80\x98patch\xe2\x80\x99 of sensors\nembedded in the aircraft skin [65]. A comparison between a mounted antenna and the new \xe2\x80\x98smart\nskin\xe2\x80\x99 antenna is depicted in Figure 53 [65].\n\nFigure 53: Comparison Between Upper Antenna and Smart Skin Antenna\n\nThe research on the development of this technology is being done collaboratively by NASA, the\nAir Force, Northrop-Grunman Corporation and TRW\xc2\xb4s Avionics Systems Division [61]. The\nsmart skin antenna has been tested successfully on an F-18 SRA aircraft where the antenna\nsystem is embedded physically and electronically into the right vertical stabilizer surface [61].\nWith this success, the TRL given for this technology, which is 2, may be increased to TRL=3.\n\nT30: Adaptive Wing Shaping\nAdaptive wing technology corresponds to wings whose shape can be altered during flight. In\nfurther detailed description, the adaptive wing has the ability to vary its shape parameters such as\nthe camber, wing twist, and thickness in order to achieve an optimized wing shape for the\nPage 81\n\nDeliverable #5 \xe2\x80\x93 Complete Report\ndifferent flight conditions [66]. \xe2\x80\x9cThe ideal use of an adaptive strategy allows the wing to vary its\ngeometric parameters in flight during encounters in situation of changing flow conditions such as\nwind speed or direction\xe2\x80\x9d [67].\nThe main governing principle of the technology is to improve the efficiency of the airfoil in offdesign flight regimes [67]. The development of this technology has now become feasible with\nthe \xe2\x80\x9cdevelopment of sensors and actuators using the smart materials that potentially can reduce\nthe complexity and weight\xe2\x80\x9d [66]. In order to achieve this, development of the variable-camber\ncontrol of the wing, which has the \xe2\x80\x9cability to actively modify airfoil camber, spanwise camber\ndistribution, and wing sweep while maintaining a smooth continuous airfoil surface\xe2\x80\x9d is being\npursued [68]. \xe2\x80\x9cThe features of the mission adaptive wing will include cruise camber control to\nmaximize vehicle efficiency during straight and level flight, maneuver camber control, maneuver\nload control, and maneuver enhancement and gust alleviation\xe2\x80\x9d [68].\nThe advantages of this technology are the increased aerodynamic efficiency of the wing, which\nwill increase lift force generation and reduce drag forces subjected to the aircraft, and a better\ncontrol and maneuverability of the aircraft that reduce the dependency on the tail control surfaces\n[67].\nCurrently, the development work on this technology is being pursued by NASA and the\ntechnology concept has been proven positively through wind tunnels experiments of the adaptive\nwing tunnel models [67]. Thus, the current TRL level for this technology, which is given as 3, is\nfairly adequate.\n\nT31, T32, T33: Biologically Inspired Material Systems\nBiologically inspired materials are materials that have the ability to self-repair when damaged\nand are able to self-assemble the structures back to a near-perfect final shape [69]. The\ntechnology development on this material will involve \xe2\x80\x9ca greater understanding of mechanical\nproperties associated with biological materials whose primary function is to sense environmental\nchanges and respond by generating forces or being modified by an applied force\xe2\x80\x9d [70]. The\nknowledge of this characteristic will enable the findings of new materials that can \xe2\x80\x9cmimic the\nextraordinary structural and self-repairing properties of biological substances such as bone or sea\nshells\xe2\x80\x9d [71]. These materials, when applied for aerospace structure applications, are expected to\nhave the ability to sense the damage conditions on its structure and take steps to repair the\ndamage [71].\nSteps have been taken in developing this technology and the refinement of \xe2\x80\x9cnecessary\ninstrumentation required characterizing these biological properties at multiple scales and using\nthis knowledge to provide hierarchical design approaches required to the engineering devices\ncapable of sensing and actuating at all scales for realization of new material systems\xe2\x80\x9d [70].\nAdvantages associated with this technology will be the reduced maintenance costs and increase\nin the life of the structure. This material will also help in reducing the weight of the aircraft by\neliminating the required redundancy in structural strength of the aircraft airframe.\n\nPage 82\n\nDeliverable #5 \xe2\x80\x93 Complete Report\nThe development on this technology has been done by NASA in collaboration with various\nacademia institutions [69]. Currently, the technology is still in the concept development stage\nand thus the current TRL level of 1 is indicative of the current development stage.\n\nT34, T35, T36: BIOSANT\nBIOSANT is the abbreviated form of BIOlogically-inspired SmArt NanoTechnology. The\nnanotechnology is corresponding to the \xe2\x80\x9cthorough three-dimensional structural control of\nmaterials, processes and devices at the atomic scale\xe2\x80\x9d, which enables the manipulation of the\nmolecular structures for technical purposes [72].\nThe development of this technology has focused on several aspects, which are the atomically\nprecise control of matter, the development of molecular machines and also the programmable\nmatter [73]. In the aerospace aspect of the technology, this BIOSANT material is preferable to be\nintegrated from its molecular components level into the larger atomically precise aircraft systems\nin order to produce a structure that can respond when being stimulated, i.e. to reform back to its\noriginal shape after being damaged by an external factor or to change shape during flight as to\nbetter suit the flight condition [74].\nThe advantages of this technology will be much higher tensile strength, lighter weight, smart and\nactive structures, a reduction in cost as structures can be developed precisely through biological\nmolecular machines, and reduced drag forces on the aircraft as much smoother aerodynamically\nshaping process is possible [72].\nCurrently, the research on this technology has been done by NASA, which is still in its earliest\nstage of concept formulation since the development in the nanotechnology materials itself is still\nin its early stage [73]. To date, \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial progress has been made towards the construction of\nmolecular computers, which will enable polymeric molecules, notably proteins, DNA, and RNA,\nbe automatically synthesized from precise specifications\xe2\x80\x9d [72]. One of the potential molecules in\nthe aerospace application is the carbon nanotubes [73]. The TRL given for this technology is 1\nand that appropriately implies that current level of this technology development.\nTechnology Compatibility\n\nAfter all the useful technology alternatives have been clearly identified, the compatibility\ncharacteristics of each technology against each other must be investigated. This is to ensure that\nthe set of technology selections to be implemented on the design will not have negative effects\non each other performance and the technologies are able to co-exist on the design. The original\nfull compatibility technology matrix provided by [16] is found to provide no flaw in depicting\nthe compatibility relationship between the technologies. Therefore, from the compatibility\nmatrix, incompatible pairs of technologies can be identified and the discussion on each of the\nincompatibility relationships is summarized in Table XXIX.\nWith this information, the technology compatibility matrix (TCM) can be constructed for each\nyear. The TCM is based on the compatibility rules and includes the technologies that have\n\nPage 83\n\nDeliverable #5 \xe2\x80\x93 Complete Report\nreached the TRL=9 data for the TCM of that year. The TCMs for the year 2007 and 2016 are\nshown in Table VI and Table VII, respectively. The TCM for the other years are included in\nAppendix F. Since the TCM is a symmetrical matrix and thus, only half of the matrix is\npopulated with the relationship signs, where 1 indicates compatible relationship and 0 means in\nincompatible combination.\nTable XXIX: Incompatible Technologies\nIncompatible Technology Pairs\n\nDiscussion\n\nT2, T12, T17\n\nThese technologies are not compatible with each\nother because each technology corresponds to\ndifferent materials and manufacturing methods\nto be utilized for the tail skin.\nThese technologies are not compatible with each\nother because each technology corresponds to\ndifferent materials and manufacturing methods\nto be utilized for the tail structure.\nThese technologies are not compatible with each\nother because each technology corresponds to\ndifferent materials and manufacturing methods\nto be utilized for the wing skin.\nThese technologies are not compatible with each\nother because each technology corresponds to\ndifferent materials and manufacturing methods\nto be utilized for the wing structure.\nThese technologies are not compatible with each\nother because T19 corresponds to the Al-Li\nAlloy materials and T25 corresponds to the\ncomposite materials, both for the fuselage skin,\nand these two types of materials do not possess a\nsuperplasticity criterion that is a requirement for\nsuperplastic forming process.\nThese technologies are not compatible with each\nother because each technology corresponds to\ndifferent materials to be utilized for the fuselage\nstructure.\n\nT3, T8, T13, T23, T32, T35\n\nT4, T14, T18\n\nT5, T9, T15, T24, T33, T36\n\nT16, T19, T25\n\nT21, T31, T34\n\nThe year 2007 is chosen because this is the first year where a collective set of technology\nalternatives can be grouped out as they reached their TRL=9 date (with the exception of the\nAdaptive Performance Optimization, which is already at TRL=9). In 2016 all of the alternative\ntechnologies will be all at their TRL=9 level. By examining the impact of technologies in 2016,\nit can be determined if by adding technologies, a feasible design space can be achieved. It can be\nseen in Table XXX that all the technology alternatives that have reached TRL=9 date by the year\n2007 are compatible with each other. This means that each of technology can be selected to be\nimplemented on the design.\n\nPage 84\n\nDeliverable #5 \xe2\x80\x93 Complete Report\nTable XXX: Technology Compatibility Matrix for Year 2007\nT1\n2000\n\nTRL=9 Date\nT1\nT2\nT3\nT4\nT5\nT6\n\nT2\n2006\n1\n\nT3\n2006\n1\n1\n\nT4\n2006\n1\n1\n1\n\nT5\n2006\n1\n1\n1\n1\n\nT6\n2007\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n\nOn the other hand, the technology compatibility matrix for the year 2016 in Table I is shown to\nbe consisted of several incompatible pairs of technologies.

In order to generate estimated\nimpact of these technologies, the impact of each technology has to be quantified, either to the\nadvantage of the system or to the degradation of the system performance, before selection of\nwhich technologies to be implemented on the aircraft is made. In making this estimation, these\ntechnologies are assumed to be matured technologies, meaning that the use of the technologies\nhave been widely accepted and verified through extensive applications in commercial fields.\nThis situation will correspond to the TRL=9 in the technology development phase, with\nadditional validated impact proofs in commercial applications. Immature technologies, on the\nother hand, corresponds to technologies that are either still under the development phase or new\ntechnologies that never been applied extensively in commercial applications.\nIt should be noted that the impacts of the technology, which are assumed in the design process,\nare based on the expected or the desired performance of the technology to the design. These\nimpacts are only applicable if and only if the technology is fully matured. Thus, by making the\nassumption that these technologies are all matured by the anticipated TRL=9 year, the impact on\nthe design is considered based on the fact that the technology has been proven in many\napplications, which reduces the risk and also the research costs to develop the technology. On\ntop of all, the technology is assumed to be ready by its anticipated TRL=9 date although there is\nalways a possibility that the TRL=9 date will be later than the date expected. For example, with\nthe current TRL of 4, the stitched RFI composite technology may be anticipated to achieve the\nreadiness level of 9 by the year 2006. However, it may takes more time to be matured and thus,\nby the year 2006, the technology may not be as ready as anticipated. This situation will\njeopardize the impact that has been input into the design probability predictions for the given sets\nof the technology applications (for year 2007 and above) since the costs of researches and the\nimpact advantages of the technology applications that have been assumed for a matured\ntechnology level will be degraded. However, in making the assumptions for the design, each\ntechnologies is taken to be at their TRL=9 level for their respective anticipated year and their\nadvantages on the design are fully applied.\nThe impact of these technologies to the design has been provided in the original Technology\nImpact Matrix (TIM) in reference [16], which is included in the Appendix G. However, the\nvalues given are corresponding only to the main advantages of each technology to the design. A\nmore extensive prediction should be made, especially in capturing the negative side of the\ntechnology to the design and also the inclusion of the design economic parameters impact.

The technologies\nidentified in Step 6 will be assessed as to see how the infusion of these technologies to the design\nwill affect the performance of the design. The impacts, either benefits or degradations, will be\npredicted using a deterministic approach rather than a probabilistic approach due to the time\nconstraint. The main objective in this step is to assess the technology impacts on the design.\nTechnology Impact Factor\n\nThe influence of the technology infusion to the design is difficult to be evaluated directly. Thus,\nthe impact is translated into \xe2\x80\x98k-factors\xe2\x80\x99, which can be quantitatively evaluated in a modeling and\nsimulation environment [3]. These \xe2\x80\x98k-factors\xe2\x80\x99 correspond to the impact subjected by each of the\ntechnologies, which are quantified by using \xe2\x80\x98k-vectors\xe2\x80\x99 that are assigned with values derived\nfrom the generated Technology Impact Matrix (TIM) in the previous step. The minimum and\nmaximum values of a particular k-factor correspond to the case when all the technologies are\nutilized into the design. These k-factors are then mapped to the input of FLOPS/ALCCA to\nobtain usable values to run the analysis codes. The corresponding values are tabulated in Table\n\nPage 88\n\nDeliverable #5 \xe2\x80\x93 Complete Report\nXXXIV.

The process\nof creating these equations will be of similar procedures as before. In a brief description, the\ncreation of the equations start by inputting the non-dimensional values of the k-factors ranges\ninto the analysis codes by means of the design of experiments table set-up for the k-factors. The\ndata results from the analysis codes (FLOPS and ALCCA) are then extracted and input into the\nstatistical software package, JMP, where the data is manipulated to create corresponding\nresponse surface equations by means of least squares method. The resultant response surface\nequations for the system level metrics with the k-factors as input variables will take the similar\nform of the second order quadratic equation, which is shown in equation 8.\n\nR = b0 + \xe2\x88\x91 bi k i + \xe2\x88\x91 bii k i2 + \xe2\x88\x91\ni =1\n\ni =1\n\n\xe2\x88\x91b k k\nij\n\ni\n\nj\n\ni =1 j = i +1\n\nwhere, R is a given system metric\nbi represents regression coefficients for linear terms\nbii represents quadratic coefficients\nbij represents cross-product coefficients\nki represents \xe2\x80\x9ck\xe2\x80\x9d vector elements\nkii denotes interactions between two \xe2\x80\x9ck\xe2\x80\x9d vector elements\nPage 89\n\nEqn. (8)\n\nDeliverable #5 \xe2\x80\x93 Complete Report\nIn assessing the impact of a given technology to the design, the technology \xe2\x80\x98k-vector\xe2\x80\x99 is mapped\nto the response surface equation. The impact values, which are quantified by the approximation\ndone in the TIM, are being inputted into the equation to get the overall quantified prediction\nimpact on the design parameters. These values will be the values for the corresponding ki or kj in\nthe equation. Assuming that for a given system level metric, with two k-factors subjected to the\nimpact of infusion of one technology, the corresponding response surface equation for the kfactors will be as shown in equation 9 [17].\n2\n\n2\n\nR = b0 + b1k1 + b2k 2 + b11k1 + b22 k 2 + b12k1\n\nEqn. (9)\n\nFrom the TIM, the technology has been estimated to reduce k1 value by (-50%) and has no\nimpact on the k2 factor. Thus, these predicted k-vector values are mapped to the response surface\nequation by substituting the vector value into the corresponding k-factor value. Thus, equation 2\nwill results as shown in equation 10. This is how the technology k-vectors are mapped to the\nresponse surface equations [3].\nR = b0 + b1 (\xe2\x88\x9250%) + b2 (0%) + b11 (\xe2\x88\x9250%) 2 + b22 (0%) 2 + b12 (\xe2\x88\x9250%)(0%)\n\nEqn. (10)\n\nThe corresponding response surface equations for the system level metrics are created in JMP.\nThe coefficients of the response surface equations generated are listed in Appendix J. The\naccuracy of the response surface equations can then being investigated through the examination\nof the corresponding R2 value, whole model test, and residual plot of the RSE of a given metric.\nTable XXXV list the R2 values, the maximum and minimum errors of the distributions, the\nstandard deviation of the error distribution, and the mean of the error distribution. The tests for\nthe goodness of fit and error distributions for the random cases are displayed in Appendix K. All\nof the tests pass, verifying a good RSE. As should be predicted, the error in random cases is\nlarger than the original cases investigated in creating the equations. The maximum error for most\ncases is less than 1.5%, except for the $/RPM and the NOx cases that correspond to about 3% of\nmaximum error. The value for the standard deviation is below 1 for all cases except again for the\n$/RPM and NOx cases, which have the values of 1.44 and 1.18, respectively. Although the\nstandard deviation values for these cases are above than 1, the corresponding maximum error\nvalues are small. Thus, all the equations can be considered to be good fits.\nTable XXXV: Summary of FIT for Responses\nMetric\nApproach Speed\nLanding FL\nTOFL\nCO2/ASM\nNOx\nTOGW\nAcquisition $\nRDT&E\n$/RPM\nTAROC\nDOC+I\nWAWt\n\nMinimum\nError (%)\n-0.036\n-0.036\n-0.313\n-0.281\n-0.984\n-0.079\n-0.172\n-0.111\n-1.404\n-0.427\n-0.518\n-0.269\n\nMaximum\nError (%)\n0.048\n0.043\n0.232\n0.208\n0.626\n0.06\n0.127\n0.073\n1.469\n0.440\n0.547\n0.313\n\nStandard Deviation of\nError Distribution\n0.0131412\n0.0152698\n0.0991517\n0.0780068\n0.2364763\n0.0225849\n0.0511374\n0.0308667\n0.4461861\n0.1374065\n0.1644542\n0.0972956\n\nPage 90\n\nMean of Error\nDistribution\n0.0000015\n0.0000000\n-0.000003\n0.0000196\n0.0003171\n0.0000013\n0.0000065\n-0.000004\n0.0013586\n-0.000003\n0.000022\n-0.000028\n\nR2 Value\n0.999998\n0.999997\n0.999975\n0.999980\n0.999864\n0.999991\n0.999995\n0.999998\n0.999437\n0.999969\n0.999961\n0.999992\n\nDeliverable #5 \xe2\x80\x93 Complete Report\nImpacts of the K-Factors\n\nThe prediction profiles for the metrics as a function of the k-factors, at the baseline k-factor\nvalues, are shown in Figure 54. These profiles show the sensitivity of the metrics to the changes\nof the k-factors.\n\nFigure 54: Prediction Profiles of the Metrics Against The K-Factors (baseline values)\n\nFrom the prediction profiles, relationship between the k-factors to the performance and economic\nmetrics can be defined. It can be seen that there are at least 12 k-factors that have influences on\ndifferent sets of the metrics, which are the wing weight (FRWI), fuselage weight (FRFU),\ninduced drag coefficient (FCDI), parasite drag coefficient (FCDO), the engine weight (WENG),\nfuel consumption (FACT), RDT&E costs (AKRDTE), O&S costs (AKOANDS), production\ncosts (AKPRICE), utilization level (U), wing area (SW) and the thrust-to-weight ratio (TWR).\nApart from the mentioned factors, the others seem to have either a very small impact or no\nimpact at all on the interested metrics.\nThe wing weight has an influence on almost all the performance metrics. The relationship\nfollows that the reduction of the wing weight will reduce the corresponding values for all the\nmetrics. Similar argument can be said about the influence of the fuselage weight but to a much\nsmaller magnitude compared to the influence of the wing weight.\nBoth of the drag coefficients, induced drag and the parasite drag, have significant impact on the\nCO2 and NOx emission levels and a small influence on the takeoff gross weight. The reduction\nof both the drag coefficients will decrease the emission levels and also the takeoff gross weight.\n\nPage 91\n\nDeliverable #5 \xe2\x80\x93 Complete Report\nSimilarly, the impact of reducing the fuel consumption will also produce the same impacts but to\na much greater magnitude.\nThe engine weight is found to have significant effect only on the takeoff gross weight, where the\nreduction of the engine weight will reduce the total gross weight. On the other hand, the RDT&E\ncosts changes will have a significant impact on the acquisition price and obviously, the RDT&E\ncosts itself. It follows that the reduction in the RDT&E costs will reduce the magnitude of the\ntwo metrics.\nThe O&S costs and the production costs are found to have similar impact on three economic\nmetrics, which are the required yield per RPM, the total aircraft required operating costs, and\nalso the direct operating costs. The two factors have a directly proportional relationship with\nthese metrics, with the former having a bigger magnitude of impact. In addition to that, the latter\nfactor has an additional significant impact on the acquisition cost in the same relationship\nmanner.\nThe utilization level and the wing area have indirect proportional relationships with the metrics.\nThe utilization level can be seen to have significant impact on economic metrics such as the\nrequired yield per RPM, the total airplane operating costs, and the direct operating costs plus\ninterest. The higher the utilization level is, the lower the amount of the impacted metrics. The\nwing area (SW) factor can be seen to have a great impact on four of the metrics, which are the\napproach velocity, landing field length, takeoff field length and the wing aerial weight. It follows\nthat for each of the metrics, the increasing value of the wing area, the lower the corresponding\nvalues for the metrics will be. As for the thrust-to-weight ratio, it is shown that it has small\ninfluence on different performance metrics. The obvious impact from this factor is the takeoff\nfield length, where a directly proportional relationship exists.\nFeasibility and Viability with K-Factors\n\nBy observing the minimum and maximum values of the metrics from the prediction profile, the\ntarget value for DOC+I for the year 2022 can never be achieved, regardless of what the\ncombinations of technologies being infused into the design. The other metrics have shown that\nwith the right combinations of the technologies, the target values can be obtained. The\nperformance metrics of the approach speed, landing field length, takeoff field length, and takeoff\ngross weight have been shown that regardless of the settings of the technology impact factors,\nthe target values for these four metrics would always be achieved. Table XXXVI, lists the kfactor values of the unmodified design, in other words, the optimized baseline values of the kfactors.

In each one of these\ncontour plots, the red dot signifies the baseline value.\n\nFigure 55: Contour Plots of Optimized Baseline\n\nTo analyze the implementation of technologies, one can alter the k-factors until a feasible and\nviable space is achieved. The three constraints that are not met are those of CO2/ASM, NOx, and\nDOC+I. In order to create a feasible and viable space, one observes from the prediction profile\nPage 94\n\nDeliverable #5 \xe2\x80\x93 Complete Report\nthat that CO2/ASM and NOx are highly influenced by drag coefficients and fuel consumption.\nDOC+I is highly influenced by operation costs, acquisition price, and utilization. Taken these\nobservations in consideration, one can modify the k-values in the contour plots to obtain a\nfeasible and viable space. Figure 56 shows the new contour plots and k-factor settings. Note that\nthe Wing Area and Thrust to Weight Ratio were kept constant to signify a fixed geometry\nanalyzes and for comparison of similar conditions with the other studies.\n\nFigure 56: Contour Plots with Modified K-Factors\n\nPage 95\n\nDeliverable #5 \xe2\x80\x93 Complete Report\nBased on the knowledge so far regarding the technology impact, the required settings of the\nimpact values to meet the performance and economic metric targets can be derived. The\nselection of the combination setting is done by including considerations on the easiness and risk\nfactor in achieving the settings set-forth for a particular impact factor. For example, in achieving\nthe target values for the emission levels, few combinations of settings can be derived out, with\nthe two drag coefficients and the fuel consumption factors settings as the main factors. However,\nto reduce drag is easier than to reduce the fuel consumption, thus the selected combination of the\nsettings should be based on this knowledge accordingly.\nThe procedure can be repeated again considering only the performance metrics, and again only\nconsidering the economic metrics.

These two will significantly change the emission metrics\nto allow for feasible space. From the study, one can conclude that if the drag coefficients can be\nreduced by about 13%, with a 4% reduction in fuel consumption, then the design becomes\nfeasible.\nOn the other hand, for a viable space only, it is necessary to reduce the operation cost, the\nproduction cost and to increase utilization. The large changes (about 13% each) will provide a\nviable space along with a large reduction in engine weight (25%) and a fuel consumption\nreduction of about 10%. The engine and fuel consumption reductions would be achieved by\nimplementing related technologies, while the others are results of the materials, process, and\ntechnologies to be implemented.\nFor the study in which all the responses were considered, smaller reductions were necessary to\nobtain a feasible and viable space, but more factors needed to be altered. For example, a feasible\nspace required a 14% reduction in wing weight, which can be accomplished using composites or\nother materials. Smaller changes (about 8%) in drag coefficients were required, due to the\ninteraction of them with other k-factors. Also, the engine weight and fuel consumption need to\nbe reduced a smaller percentage when only economic responses were studied. Finally, the\nRDT&E costs, O&S costs, and Utilization were required to change a smaller percentage as well\ndue to the advantages of the other reductions.\n\nPage 99\n\nDeliverable #5 \xe2\x80\x93 Complete Report\nDeterministic Technology Evaluation\n\nOnce it has been proven that the implementation of technologies will allocate a feasible and\nviable space, the technologies are grouped into categories for yearly implementations. For this\nreport, the technologies were grouped as listed in Table XLII. These technology combinations\nmainly consist of two main categories of technologies. One is the baseline technology and the\nother is consisted of technology alternatives available for infusion in a given year. The baseline\ntechnologies are the technologies that are already matured (TRL=9) at the given year and also\nare compatible with every other technology alternatives available. This also corresponds to\ntechnologies that have application that is different than any other technology alternatives. The\ntechnologies for a given year are made of selected technology alternatives that are matured in\nthat year (TRL=9). These technologies may or may not be compatible with each other.\nTable XLII: Technologies Implemented by Year\nYear\n2006\n2007-2008\n2009\n2010\n\nBaseline Technologies\n\n1\n1, 6, 7\n\n2011-2012\n\n1, 6, 7\n\n2013\n\n1, 6, 7, 10, 11, 20, 27, 28\n\n2014\n\n1, 6, 7, 10, 11, 20, 26, 27, 28\n\n2015 -2016\n\n1, 6, 7, 10, 11, 20, 26, 27, 28, 29\n\nNew Technologies\n1, 2, 3, 4, 5\n1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7\n2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11\n2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14,\n15\nT2-3, T4-5, T11-12, T14-15,\n8, 9, 10, 11, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20\nT2-3, T4-5, 8, 9, 16, 17, 18, 21,\n22, 23, 24, 25, 26\nT2-3, T4-5, 8, 9, 17, 18, 21, 22,\n23, 24, 25, 29, 30\n25, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36\n\nThere are 36 different technology alternatives that have been identified for consideration on\nimproving the design performance in achieving the target goals. However, to run a deterministic\nevaluation on all or even half of these technology impacts concurrently for a given year would be\ntoo time consuming since a full-factorial design of experiments for 36 alternatives will\ncorresponds to almost 6.872 x 1010 different combination cases. Thus, tradeoffs between the\ntechnologies (with the exception of the baseline technologies since they are compatible to every\nother technology and they are corresponding to unique application that is different from the\nothers) must be made for each year.\nThe technology tradeoffs process can be approached in many ways. As for the selection in the\nTable XLII, tradeoffs have been made between cost and performance. The process of eliminating\nthe technology options are done to the different alternatives that are providing the same\nimprovements on the same design parts or impact factors. These technology alternatives are\ncompared to each other relative to the cost incurred with the implementation on the design as\nwell as to the resultant performance from the implementation. For example, for the year 2013,\none of the technology alternatives that have been discarded is the Russian Aluminum Lithium\nFuselage skin. The Russian Aluminum Lithium fuselage skin has a higher cost for\nimplementation as well as less of a performance improvement than the superplastic forming\ntechnology. If both the technologies have comparable cost and performance characteristics, then\n\nPage 100\n\nDeliverable #5 \xe2\x80\x93 Complete Report\nboth of them are considered. This is the case for the superplastic forming technology and the\ncomposite technology on wing and tail parts for the 2013 year.\nIn contrast, another approach for tradeoffs are comparing technology alternatives for the same\napplication and considering either the alternative with the best cost or the alternative with the\nbest performance. By doing the former, the design is expected to have improved performance\nwith lowest possible additional costs of technology implementation. On the other hand, the latter\napproach will correspond to considering only the technology that has superior performance,\nregardless of the cost incurred by the technology implementation. In this approach, the\nalternatives selected will most likely be the latest technology improvements that have greater\nimprovements in performance with association of higher costs. The tradeoff processes used in\nselecting the technology alternatives for this design are a balance between the total cost and the\ntotal performance.\nFor each one of the years listed in Table XLII, a full factorial deterministic analysis was\nperformed. The first step was to get the DoE using JMP. The DoE was then copied to the\nprovided excel workbook. The workbook contains three main spreadsheets and one macro. The\nfirst spreadsheet contains the DoE, and the calculated k factors depending on the TIM and the\ncombination of active technologies. The third spreadsheet contains the RSEs previously\ncalculated. The second spreadsheet is used to calculate the responses using the RSEs and the kfactors. The k-factors are calculated using some logic statements that take in consideration\nincompatible technologies. For the cases at which two or more technologies that are\nincompatible are on, the latest technology is chosen as active. It is assumed that a latter\ntechnology will have more advantages that might not be considered in the time matrix, such as\ntime required to obtained part from contractor might be shorter, among others. The following\nlogic statement is a sample for one of the k-factors for one of the implemented years.\nk-factor=1 + (0) + (0) + (0) + (0) + (0) + (0) + (0) + (0) + (-0.05) + IF($H8151=1,0,0) +\nIF($I8151=1,0,0) + IF($L8151=1,0,0) + IF($M8151=1,0,0) + IF($N8151=1,0,0) +\nIF(AND($J8151=-1,$F8151=-1,$D8151=-1,$B8151=1),0,0)\n+\nIF(AND($K8151=1,$G8151=-1,$E8151=-1,$C8151=1),-0.16,0) + IF(AND($J8151=-1,$D8151=1),0,0) +\nIF(AND($K8151=-1,$E8151=1),-0.2,0) + IF($F8151=1,0,0)+IF($G8151=1,-0.03,0) +\nIF($J8151=1,0,0) + IF($K8151=1,-0.15,0)\nIn the logic statement above, the if statements refers to whether the technologies are on (1) or off\n(-1) and a \xe2\x80\x98TRUE\xe2\x80\x99 response results in the first number after the coma and a \xe2\x80\x98FALSE\xe2\x80\x99 results in\nthe second number after the coma. The statement also takes in consideration incompatible\ntechnologies. For example: IF(AND($J8151=-1,$F8151=-1,$D8151=-1,$B8151=1),0,0) states\nthat if the technologies in cells J, F, and D are off (-1), and the technology in cell B is on (1), the\nstatement will result in \xe2\x80\x98TRUE\xe2\x80\x99 and only the contribution of B is added or subtracted from the k\nfactor.\nThe logic statements for the RDT&E costs are slightly different. Besides the AND statements,\nthey contain \xe2\x80\x98OR\xe2\x80\x99 statements to account for only one of the related technologies to be on (1) to\nadd or subtract the contribution of those technologies to the k-factor.\n\nPage 101\n\nDeliverable #5 \xe2\x80\x93 Complete Report\nAfter calculating the responses using the macro for each implementation year, the responses\nwere copied to JMP and prediction profiles were obtained. The prediction profiles include a\n\xe2\x80\x9cCompatability\xe2\x80\x9d response easily calculate for each case of the full factorial analysis using similar\nlogic statements as shown above. The prediction profiles are a way of assessing the impact of\nturning a technology on. The purpose of the compatibility response is to indicate that if when a\ntechnology is turned on, and the compatibility drops below one, the results are bogus, meaning\nthat the set technology choices are not compatible, therefore, non existent.\nFigure 59 is the prediction profile of the technologies for the year 2007. This picture shows how\neach of the seven technologies affect the responses. As technology 1 (adaptive performance\noptimization) is turned on, all the metrics except for acquisition price are reduced. The increase\nin acquisition price is small, which indicates that this technology is extremely advantageous\nbecause even though it increases the initial price of the aircraft, the operation cost over its life\nends up saving money for the airline company. The main responses altered by this technology\nare the emission responses, $/RMP, TAROC, and DOC+I. Technologies 2 though 5 implement\ncomposite materials in several sections of the aircraft. These technologies reduce all of the\nperformance metrics because of the reduced weight and smoother surfaces, but all the economic\nmetrics increase because of the complexity of maintaining, manufacturing, and extra research\nneeded for implementation. Technologies one through 4 highly affect the economic metrics,\nwhile technology 5 (composite on wing structure) encompasses more surface area are is largely\nrelated to the performance metrics, therefore, the performance metrics are highly improved using\ntechnology 5. Technology 6 (airframe methods) decreases all the metrics, including performance\nand economic metrics. A large decrease in gas emissions and RDT&E costs are results of this\ntechnology being turned on. Technology 7 (fire suppression) does not seem to affect any metric\nin a suitable manner. This technology decreases slightly the performance metrics and increases\nslightly the economic metrics.\nFigure 60 is the prediction profile of the technologies over the responses for the years 20152016. This combination included 10 technologies that are compatible with all other technologies,\ntherefore they are considered as baseline technologies. Another 8 technologies are analyzed for\nthis year. This combination has 6 technologies that are not fully compatible (3 groups of 2\nincompatible technologies). The prediction profiles for technology 25 (composite fuselage shell)\nshow minimal improvement for the performance metrics with a large increase in economic\nmetrics. This most probably indicated that this technology will not be selected for the design.\nTechnology 30 (adaptive wing shaping) shows a very large improvement in the performance\nmetrics, mainly the emissions, with decreasing yield required and operation costs. This indicated\nthat this technology requires a higher RDT&E investment and initial aircraft price, but with life\ncycle cost reductions. Technologies 31 (bio materials on fuselage) and 34 (BIOSANT on\nfuselage) have very comparable effects on the metrics. These show reducing performance\nmetrics, reducing O&S costs, yield per RPM, TAROC, and DOC+I with increasing responses to\nRDT&E and acquisition price. This allows to conclude that either would be beneficial for a\nhigher initial investment of both parts, the manufacturer and the airliner. Technologies 32 (bio\nmaterials on tail) and 35 (BIOSASNT on tail) show no improvement in any metric and it highly\nincreases RDT&E and acquisition price, therefore this technology is not beneficial and should\nnot be included as an option. Technologies 33 (bio material on wing) and 36 (BIOSANT on\nwing) show a large improvement in all the responses with a very small changes in RDT&E costs\n\nPage 102\n\nDeliverable #5 \xe2\x80\x93 Complete Report\nand acquisition price. Either of these technologies should be highly considered when selecting\ntechnologies because of the low price of implementation. The rest of the year combinations can\nbe found in Appendix L.\n\nFigure 59: Prediction Profile for the Year 2007\n\nPage 103\n\nDeliverable #5 \xe2\x80\x93 Complete Report\n\nFigure 60: Prediction Profile for the Years 2015-2016\n\nAfter each of the technologies were examined separately, a full range of technology\ncombinations were explored. In order to determine how multiple technologies effect the vehicle,\nit was assumed that the effects were additive. By summing all of the k-factors associated with\nthe technologies that are implemented into the vehicle, a new vector of k-factors, representing\nthe combinational effects, is created as illustrated in Figure 61 [16]. In reality, some of the\nimpacts of the different technology infusions on the same application may or may not be\nindependent of each other. If the implementation of technology is in such a way that the effects\nof one technology is totally isolated than the other, then the impacts may be independent with\neach other. However, if the implementation of the different technologies allows the effects of one\ntechnology to have interaction with that from the other, then the technology impacts are not\nadditive. This condition occurs due to the interaction effects between the different technology\nperformance that may degrade or even enhance the performance of the other. For example, the\nimplementation of both leading edge slat and trailing edge slotted flap on the wing will increase\nPage 104\n\nDeliverable #5 \xe2\x80\x93 Complete Report\nthe lift independently by approximately 71% and 107 %, respectively [75]. However, by\nimplementing both devices, the increment in lift will not be simply the addition of 71% and\n107%, which is 178% in total. In fact, the total increment may just be around 130% since by\nimplementing the leading edge slat, the flow characteristics and behavior are changed before it\ncomes to the effect of the trailing edge slotted flap. This will reduce the performance effects of\nthe flap compared to that when it encounters the fresh free flow. Therefore, the impact of\nimplementing these two high-lift devices technology on the generated lift is not additive in\nnature. However, for all the technology combinations presented in this study, an additive\nassumption captures the interactions and is a valid assumption [76].\nAlternative with:\nConsider an alternative\nT3\nwith aircraft morphing (T3)\n~\nand IHPTET engines (T9)\n\nRecall:\nr\n\nki =\n\nk_1\nk_2\nk_3\nk_4\nk_5\nk_6\nk_7\nk_8\nk_9\nk_10\nk_11\nk_12\nk_13\nk_14\nk_15\n\nr\n3\n\n=\n\n~\n~\n-3%\n-1.5%\n-3%\n-2%\n~\n~\n~\n~\n~\n+2%\n-3%\n~\n\nAlternative with:\nT9\n~\n~\n~\n~\n-5%\n~\n~\n~\n-20%\n~\n~\n-3%\n+3%\n~\n+2%\n\nr\nk9 =\n\nAlternative with:\nT3+T9\n~\n~\n~\n-3%\n-6.5%\n-3%\n-2%\n3+\n~\n-20%\n~\n~\n-3%\n+5%\n-3%\n+2%\n\nr\n\n=\n\nMetric RSE =\nf(\n\nr\n+\n\n)\n\nFigure 61: Example Technology Evaluation with \xe2\x80\x9cK\xe2\x80\x9d Vectors\n\nIn order to truly capture the non-additive nature into account, each of the technology\ncombinations would have to be individually studied and appropriate k-factors derived. For this\nproject, the assumption that the effects of multiple technologies are additive is appropriate since\nthe interdependence was considered to be a secondary effect, which would not need to be\nexamined to capture the main technology impacts.\nOther Methods for Evaluating Technologies\n\nThere are two ways to evaluate the impact of technologies on the design. The first is the\ndeterministic approach, which has been the method for the evaluation of the new technologies.\nThis is a \xe2\x80\x9cfirst cut\xe2\x80\x9d attempt at examining the influence of technologies. The impact of the\ntechnologies has been evaluated on a fixed vehicle configuration. One of the reasons for this is\nto identify if by implementing technologies a feasible and viable design space could be achieved\nsimply by incorporating new technologies. Another reason is that the k-factors already include\nthe influence on the geometry [77]. Investigating the technology space and design space\nconcurrently would allow for the best mix of technologies to be implemented on an aircraft\nwhere the configuration best suits the technologies. In order do this, a DOE must be created that\nwill capture the effects of every possible configuration with every possible combination of\ntechnologies. This would result in a DOE of thousands of cases, a large computational expense.\nIn order to reduce the number of variables, a screening test on the variables can be performed.\nA DOE that incorporates the most important variables can be used to crate an RSE. The kfactors and economic variables can then be incorporated to each of the cases in the DoE table\nPage 105\n\nDeliverable #5 \xe2\x80\x93 Complete Report\nand a Fast Probability Integration (FPI) can be performed by using normal distributions. A\nMonte Carlo Simulation can be executed to create CDF probabilities. If the fixed configuration\nwith added technologies does not prove to produce a feasible and viable design space, examining\nthe technology space and design space concurrently may open up the solution space [77].\nAnother approach in evaluating the impact of new technologies is the probabilistic approach.\nThis method can account for those technologies that are not fully matured, where there is a\nchance they may not reach the maximum impact [3]. The probabilistic approach will take into\nconsideration this variability. Using a probabilistic approach would be completed in a similar\nmanner as was done in the design space exploration. A Monte Carlo simulation of a distribution\nshape would need to be defined for each response and approximately 2000 random cases would\nbe run. This would give the statistical information as well as CDF for all of the responses. The\ncomputational expense is that for a large number of variables, in order to conduct a full factorial\ninvestigation, millions of cases would need to be run. One way to reduce the computation time\nis to reduce the number of variables. This can be done using a genetic algorithm approach,\nwhich \xe2\x80\x9cis a search strategy based on a Darwinian evolution of survival of the fittest\xe2\x80\x9d [17]. A\ngenetic algorithm uses a fitness function and iterates through crossovers and mutations of an\ninitial random set of concepts. The function will converge to a set of data that will meet an\noverall measure of value [17]. When selecting the best family of alternatives, a Pugh Evaluation\nMatrix is used. The concept alternatives, or cases with different technology combinations, go in\nthe first column of the matrix and the important metrics go in the first row. Using the data from\nthe CDFs created, for each concept alternative the corresponding metric at a specific confidence\nlevel is placed in the correct cell. This confidence level is related to the risk or uncertainty for a\ntechnology and is chosen subjectively [17].\n\nSELECT THE BEST FAMILY OF ALTERNATIVES\nThe final step of the TIES process is to select which combination of alternatives will best create\na feasible and viable system. Three approaches will be used in the analysis of technology mixes\nincluding:\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nMulti-Attribute Decision Making (MADM) techniques in the form of TOPSIS\nTechnology Frontiers: Performance and Economic Effectiveness\nTechnology Sensitivities: One-to-one technology comparison\n\nThe final combination of alternatives is up to the discretion of the design team based on the\noutput of all four analyses [16].\nMulti-Attribute Decision Making: TOPSIS\n\nMulti-Attribute Decision Making (MADM) is a tool to aid in selecting the best alternative. A\n\xe2\x80\x9ccompensatory\xe2\x80\x9d model allows for trade-offs among attributes to be made. One of these models\nis the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS). This approach\nis based on the idea that the best solution is the shortest Euclidean distance from the \xe2\x80\x9cideal\xe2\x80\x9d\n\nPage 106\n\nDeliverable #5 \xe2\x80\x93 Complete Report\nsolution and the farthest from the \xe2\x80\x9cnegative-ideal\xe2\x80\x9d solution.\nalternatives to be ranked from this numerical analysis [78].\n\nThis allows for all of the\n\nThere are six steps for executing a TOPSIS analysis explained in reference [79] and outlined\nbriefly here. The first step is to create a decision matrix that lists the different alternatives in the\nfirst column and the criteria are in the first row. Each of the responses to the evaluation criteria\nare placed in the appropriate cell and then normalized by dividing each criterion by the norm of\nthe total outcome vector, Eqn 11.\nrij\nnorm =\nm\nEqn. (11)\n2\n\xe2\x88\x91 rij\ni =1\n\nwhere rij is the numerical outcome of the ith alternative with respect to the jth criteria of m\nalternatives. The second step is to multiply each of the normalized responses by the weights of\nfor each criterion that is based on the decision makers\xe2\x80\x99 importance rating. The next step is to\ndetermine the positive-ideal and negative-ideal solutions. The positive-ideal solution, A*, is a\nvector containing the maximum value for criteria that are a benefit criteria (criteria that a\nmaximization is desired) or the minimum value for the cost criteria (criteria the a minimization is\ndesired). The negative-ideal solution, A-, is the opposite; a vector of the minimum value for\nbenefit criteria or the maximum value of the cost criteria. The fourth step in the TOPSIS\nanalysis is to calculate the separation, or the Euclidean distance, between each alternative and the\npositive-ideal, Si*, and negative-ideal, Si-, solutions, given by Eqn. 12.\nS i*/ \xe2\x88\x92 =\n\n\xe2\x88\x91 (AlternativeValue \xe2\x88\x92 A )\n\n*/ \xe2\x88\x92 2\n\nEqn. (12)\n\nThe next step is to determine the relative closeness of each alternative to the positive-ideal\nsolution, given by Eqn. 13.\n\nS i\xe2\x88\x92\nCi = *\nS i + S i\xe2\x88\x92\n\nEqn. (13)\n\nThe solutions for the closeness will range from zero and one, where Ci=1 for A* and Ci=0 for A-.\nThe final step in the TOPSIS analysis is to rank the alternatives in descending order of Ci. The\nlargest value of closeness is the best alternative.\nTOPSIS requires the use of deterministic values for creating the decision matrix and for ranking\nthe alternatives so information about the variability of technology mixes, costs, and time may be\nlost. In order to overcome this shortcoming, the decision maker can analysis the top alternatives\nfor different confidence levels and weighting scenarios. The decision maker should compare the\nresults and look for a combination that consistently ranks within the top ten or so regardless of\nconfidence level [79].\n\nPage 107\n\nDeliverable #5 \xe2\x80\x93 Complete Report\nWeighting Scenarios\nIn order to evaluate the different sets of technologies combinations, ten different weighting\nscenarios were developed. The basis on the development on these different scenarios is the\nweighted consideration of the design performance and economics. Emphasis has been made to\nthe metrics that are found to govern the feasibility space of the design, namely the CO2/ASM,\nNOx, and also the DOC+I.

As the scenario goes from 1 to 10, the main consideration is\nshifting from the extreme of performance-based to the economics- based. The scenarios 3 to 8\ncan be taken as the transition phase between the extremes of the performance and economics\nconsiderations. It is important to have this variation to see which of the technology combinations\nwill top both in the event of performance and economics considerations concurrently.\nTo further visualize the different scenarios, each of the metrics is depicted on Figure 62, where\nthe plots are depicting the respective share of each metric for the different scenarios. As can be\nseen, three major considerations for almost all scenarios are the three metrics that govern the\nfeasibility space of the design, namely the emissions level of NOx and C02/ASM, and also the\ndirect operating cost plus interest (DOC+I).\n\nPage 108\n\nDeliverable #5 \xe2\x80\x93 Complete Report\n\nWAWt\nDOC+I\n\nTAROC\n\nVapp\n0.3\n0.25\n0.2\n0.15\n0.1\n0.05\n0\n\nLndgFL\n\nScenario 1\nScenario 2\nScenario 3\n\nTOFL\n\nScenario 4\nScenario 5\n\nCO2/ASM\n\n$/RPM\n\nScenario 6\nScenario 7\nScenario 8\n\nNOx\n\nScenario 9\nRDT&E\n\nScenario 10\n\nTOGW\nAcq$\n\nFigure 62: Metrics Considerations for the Different Weighting Scenarios\n\nThe results of the TOPSIS evaluation for the different weighting scenarios for the year 2007 are\ntabulated in Table XLIV as follows.\nTable XLIV: Top Rankings Technology Mixes for Different Weighting Scenarios for Year 2007\n\nR\nanking\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n\n1\n128\n112\n127\n111\n96\n80\n95\n79\n120\n104\n\n2\n111\n80\n79\n112\n95\n127\n96\n104\n120\n128\n\n3\n103\n71\n79\n72\n87\n104\n119\n88\n111\n80\n\n4\n71\n103\n72\n87\n79\n104\n88\n119\n80\n111\n\nW tin S arios\neigh g cen\n5\n6\n71\n71\n72\n67\n67\n68\n103\n72\n68\n103\n87\n87\n99\n99\n83\n83\n75\n75\n79\n100\n\n7\n67\n71\n68\n99\n83\n72\n87\n103\n75\n84\n\n8\n67\n68\n71\n83\n99\n87\n72\n103\n75\n84\n\n9\n67\n68\n71\n83\n99\n87\n72\n103\n75\n84\n\n10\n67\n68\n71\n83\n99\n87\n72\n103\n84\n75\n\nFrom the table above, a few technology mixes can be seen to appear in most of the different\nweighting scenarios.

Each of the different technology mixes has strengths and weaknesses that\ncan be derived from their closeness ratings for the different scenarios. For example, technology\nmix 67 has very good results in the scenarios defined for economics parameters (i.e. WS 8, 9, 10)\nbut has a very bad results for the performance-based scenarios (i.e. WS 1, 2, 3).\nThe results of the TOPSIS evaluation for the different weighting scenarios for the year 2016 are\ntabulated in Table XLVI. The table indicates that a few technology mixes can be seen to appear\nin most of the different weighting scenarios.

Table XLIX, below, list the best compromises of technology combinations, even\ntough none of these make the system feasible.\nTable XLIX: Best Compromises of Technologies for 2007\nCase #\n71\n72\n87\n103\n\nTechnology Mix\nT1+T5+T6\nT1+T5+T6+T7\nT1+T3+T5+T6\nT1+T2+T5+T6\n\n1.25\n\nPE Threshold\n1.15\n\nNo Technologies\n\n1.10\n\n1 TECH\n2 TECH\n\nEE Threshold\n\nPerformance Effectiveness\n\n1.20\n\nIDEAL\nBest Compromises\n\n1.05\n\n3 TECH\n4 TECH\n5 TECH\n6 TECH\n7 TECH\nIDEAL\n\nTechnology Frontier\n\n1.00\n\n0.95\n0.9\n\n0.95\n\n1\n\n1.05\n\n1.1\n\n1.15\n\n1.2\n\n1.25\n\n1.3\n\n1.35\n\n1.4\n\nEconomic Effectiveness\nFigure 65: Tech Front 2007\n\nFigure 66 is the PE versus EE plot for the years 2015-2016.

As the plot shows, by the year 2015-2016 every compatible combination of\nPage 114\n\nDeliverable #5 \xe2\x80\x93 Complete Report\ntechnologies result in a feasible solution, and 6 of them contain EE that surpass the economic\nthreshold.

The plot for the year 2011 shows that there are no combinations that make the system\nviable. On the other hand, the PE versus EE plot shown in the appendix for the year 2014 shows\nthat several combinations overcome the constraints. Two sets of best compromises are identified\nin the picture. The one on the top of the graph represent the best performance compromises.\nThe ones below represent the best economic compromises.

This allows for the designer to see how the\ntechnologies influence the responses and decide which technologies should be researched and\ndeveloped, since a single company does not have the resources to invest in a large number of\ntechnologies [79].\nSince the emissions and DOC+I metrics were not met, the technology sensitivities will be\ndiscussed in the body of this report. The remaining graphs are provided in Appendix O \xe2\x80\x93\nTechnology Sensitivities. As can be seen in Figure 67, the majority of the technologies will\nactually increase CO2 emissions. However, by implementing T20 and T30, a reduction in CO2\nemissions of 9% and 17%, respectively, can be achieved.\nT36\nT33\n\nT35\n\nT34\n\nT32\n\nT31\n\nT30\n\nT29\nT28\nT27\n\nTechnologies\n\nT26\nT25\nT24\n\nT19\nT18\nT17\nT16\nT15\nT14\nT13\nT12\nT11\nT10\n\nT9\n\nT6\nT5\n\nT8\nT7\nT4\n\nT1\n\n-20\n\nT23\n\nT22\nT21\n\nT20\n\n-15\n\n-10\n\n-5\n\n0\n\nT3\nT2\n\n5\n\nPercent Change from Baseline\n\nFigure 67: Technology Sensitivity for CO2\n\nFigure 68 illustrates the effects of the technologies on NOx emissions.

However, if a\nprobabilistic analysis had been done, confidence intervals would have to be created to capture\nthe uncertainty that the technologies would not perform as expected. The percent reduction will\ndecrease for a low percent confidence.\nAnother way of looking at the technology sensitivities is to graph a single technology to see how\nit influences the metrics. Two technologies that largely affect the emissions constraints are T20\nand T30. Figure 70 shows that by implementing T20, all of the metrics are decreased; mainly\nCO2 and NOx are decreased by approximately 17%. Similarly, Figure 71 shows that T30\nbenefits a majority of the metrics and especially our constrained emissions metrics.\n\nPage 117\n\nDeliverable #5 \xe2\x80\x93 Complete Report\n0\n\nPercent Change from Baseline\n\n-2\n\nACQ$ RDT&E\n\nVapp LndgFL\n\n-4\n\n$/RPM\n\nTOGW\n\nTOFL\n\n-6\n\nTAROC DOC+I\n\n-8\n-10\n-12\n-14\n-16\nCO2/ASM\n\n-18\n\nNOx\n\n-20\nMetrics\n\nFigure 70: Effect of Technology 20\n5\nACQ$\n\nPercent Change from Baseline\n\nRDT&E\n\n0\nVapp LndgFL\n\n-5\n\n-10\n\n$/RPM\nTOGW\n\nTOFL\n\nTAROC DOC+I\n\nCO2/ASM\n\n-15\nNOx\n\n-20\nMetrics\n\nFigure 71: Effect of Technology 30\n\nThe rest of the graphs are provided in Appendix P \xe2\x80\x93 Effects of Technologies on the Metrics.

For the decision it was assumed that the most important\nfactor was to meet all the constraints with the minimum amount of technologies. From\nTechnology Frontiers, only combinations from the year 2014 and 2015 were observed as both\nfeasible and viable, therefore it narrowed down the combination to those previously mentioned in\nthe Technology Frontiers section for those years. All of those 9 (4 from 2014 and 5 from 2016)\nwere feasible and viable at different levels. The main difference is that the combinations from\n2014 require more technologies than the combinations from 2016, therefore only the last 5 were\nPage 118\n\nDeliverable #5 \xe2\x80\x93 Complete Report\nconsidered. Table LII and LIII lists the metrics for which strict constraints were applied for the\ntop 5 technology combinations. The last two rows of this table lists the constraint values. From\nthis table, one can conclude that the first top choice (T30+T34+ T35+T36) is the best\ncombination because it meets the emissions constraints at a level similar to the other four\ncombinations but it has the lowest DOC+I cost, with at least twice as much difference from the\nconstraint than the other ones. The reinvestigation of the best combination was done based on\nthis assumption. Unfortunately, this combination requires a total of 14 technologies to be applied\nto the 1997 baseline aircraft. This would require a tremendous investment for the manufacturer.\nA solution for this problem is to have the manufacturer invest in those technologies with high\nTRL numbers, and request the government to sponsor research on the technologies with low\nTRLs. This would allow the manufacturer to invest less money and still be able to employ all of\nthe technologies into the aircraft.\nTable LII: Metric Comparison for top 5 Alternatives\nMetric\n\nT30+T34+\nT35+T36\n\nT30+T31+\nT32+T33\n\nT30+T34+\nT36\n\nT30+T32+\nT34+T36\n\nT30+T33+\nT34+T35\n\nConstraint\n(2007)\n\nConstraint\n(2022)\n\nCO2/ASM\nNOx\nDOC+I\n\n0.1329\n216.2\n3.866\n\n0.1329\n216.7\n3.908\n\n0.1335\n215.0\n3.913\n\n0.1328\n216.0\n3.918\n\n0.1329\n215.7\n3.919\n\n0.1845\n342\n3.959\n\n0.123025\n228\n2.6395\n\nTable LIII: Percentage below the Constraint\nMetric\n\nT30+T34+\nT35+T36\n\nT30+T31+\nT32+T33\n\nT30+T34+\nT36\n\nT30+T32+\nT34+T36\n\nT30+T33+\nT34+T35\n\nCO2/ASM\nNOx\nDOC+I\n\n-27.97%\n-36.78%\n-2.35%\n\n-27.97%\n-36.64%\n-1.29%\n\n-27.64%\n-37.13%\n-1.16%\n\n-28.02%\n-36.84%\n-1.04%\n\n-27.97%\n-36.93%\n-1.01%\n\nCLOSING THE LOOP\nThis step reinvestigates the design space with all the selected technologies to determine the best\nairplane configuration. This process was similar to those mentioned in Steps 4-5. The k-factors\nwere changed in the baseline file and a DoE of the design variable was created and ran through\nFLOPS to get the responses. Theses were put into the program JMP and RSEs were created.\nAgain a Monte Carlo simulation was performed to determine the system feasibility and viability.\nAs concluded from the previous step, the best compromise of technology mix includes T30, T34,\nT35, and T36. The baseline for the year 2016 already includes T1, T6, T7, T10, T11, T20, T26,\nT27, T28, and T29. There are a total of 14 technologies that needed to be added to the original\nbaseline to produce a feasible and viable design. These 14 technologies are listed in Table LIV,\nwith the italicized technologies representing the ones selected from the possibilities for 2016.\n\nPage 119\n\nDeliverable #5 \xe2\x80\x93 Complete Report\nTable LIV: Technology Vector for Selected Family of Technologies\nID #\n\nT1\nT6\nT7\nT10\nT11\nT20\nT21\nT26\nT27\nT28\nT29\nT30\nT34\nT35\nT36\n\nTechnology Description\n\nAdaptive Performance Optimization (APO)\nAirframe Methods\nFire Suppression\nPropulsion System Health Management\nSmart Nacelle \xe2\x80\x93 Propulsion-Airframe Integration (PAI)\nAdaptive Engine Control System (ADECS)\nRevolutionary Metallic Materials Systems on Fuselage Structure\nLiving Aircraft\nActive Load Alleviation on Tail\nActive Load Alleviation on Wing\nAntenna Systems\nAdaptive Wing Shaping\nBIOSANT on Fuselage Structure\nBIOSANT on Tail Structure\nBIOSANT on Wing Structure\n\nCurrent\nTRL\n9\n4\n3\n2\n3\n4\n2\n2\n4\n4\n2\n3\n1\n1\n1\n\nTRL=9\nDate\n2000\n2007\n2007\n2009\n2009\n2011\n2013\n2013\n2013\n2013\n2014\n2014\n2015\n2015\n2015\n\nTable LV lists the technology vector values for the technology combination selected as the best\nand for baseline configurations.

The last column\nshows the comparison to the baseline metrics established at the beginning of the project, repeated\nhere for reference. The application of technologies allowed the reduction of most metrics, except\nacquisition price. Fortunately for the airliners, the increase in acquisition price is balanced by the\ndecrease in operating costs (approximately 25 % percent below the baseline values). The\nreduction of emissions, approximately 50 % from the original baseline, are very close to meeting\nthe 50 % reduction of both by the year 2022. Also, the application of technologies allows for the\nreduction of the Yield per RPM to a more rational 10.5 cents, rather than the original 12.4 cents.\nTable LVI: Comparison of Baseline Metrics to New Alternative Metrics\nMetric\nApproach Speed (knots)\nLanding Field Length (ft)\nTakeoff FIeld Length (ft)\nCO2/ASM (lb/ASM)\nNox (lb)\nTakeoff Gross Weight (lb)\nAcquisition Price (M$)\nRDT&E Costs (M$)\nYield per RPM ($)\nTAROC (c/ASM)\nDOC+I (c/ASM)\nWing Aerial Weight (lb/ft^2)\n\nBaseline\n106.8\n4897\n5367\n0.24605\n456\n148,219\n59.259\n4721.8\n0.134\n6.752\n5.279\n10.48\n\nNew Alternative\n92.6\n4301\n3659\n0.1329\n216\n116,666\n62.186\n4568\n0.103\n4.95\n3.866\n5.6\n\nUnits\nkts\nft\nft\nlb/ASM\nlb\nlbf\nM$\nM$\n$\nc/ASM\nc/ASM\nlb/ft^2\n\n% Change\n-13.3\n-12.2\n-31.8\n-46.0\n-52.6\n-21.3\n4.9\n-3.3\n-23.1\n-26.7\n-26.8\n-46.6\n\nResponse Surface Equations\n\nBased on the resultant fixed value the k-factors as mapped to the analysis codes\xe2\x80\x99 inputs\n(modified baseline input files), the corresponding response surface equations for each of the\nmetrics can be generated.

This can be seen from the CDF plots of the corresponding metrics where an\nincrease in the percent feasibility or viability of the design in complying with the constraints or\ntarget values for that particular metrics is recorded. However, the infusion of these technologies\nalso has some degradation effects on other metric, following the Pareto Frontier theory.\nThe plots of the CDF resulting from the infusion of the technologies and that of the original plots\nwithout the technologies for each of the interested metrics are plotted concurrently as to see the\ndirect comparison of the technology impacts on the design.\nAs can be seen from the Figure 72, the infusion of the selected technologies has improved the\napproach speed performance of the design. Although the original plot without the technology\ninfusion already shows 100% feasibility against the target speed of 130 knots, the infusion of the\nnew technologies enables the design to achieve a much better performance. As a rough\ncomparison, the lowest approach speed that can be achieved without the technology infusion is\nabout 100 knots whereas that same speed is about 40% feasible when the technologies are\nimplemented on the design. Since the plot pattern is the same, it can be said that the technologies\nimprove the approach speed by approximately 7% with respect to the respective percent\nfeasibility.\n\nPage 122\n\nDeliverable #5 \xe2\x80\x93 Complete Report\n100%\n\nTechnologies\nImplemented\n\nPercent Feasibility\n\n80%\n\n60%\n\nNo Technologies\n40%\n\nConstraint\n20%\n\n0%\n90\n\n100\n\n110\n\n120\n\n130\n\n140\n\nApproach Speed (knots)\n\nFigure 72: CDF Plot of Approach Speed\n\nAs can be seen from the Figure 73, the infusion of the selected technologies has improved the\nlanding field length needed for the design operation. Although the original plot without the\ntechnology infusion already shows 100% feasibility against the target field length of 7,000 ft, the\ninfusion of the new technologies enables the design to achieve a much better performance. The\nplot pattern is still the same and the infusion of the technologies just shifted the original plot to\nfurther left of the feasible design space. As a rough comparison, the shortest landing field length\nfor the design without the technologies is about 4,650 ft whereas the same length is 40% feasible\nwith the technologies. Since the plot pattern is the same, it can be said that the technologies\nimprove the required landing field length by approximately 7% with respect to the respective\npercent feasibility.\n100%\n\nPercent Feasibility\n\n80%\n\nTechnologies\nImplemented\n\nNo Technologies\n\n60%\n\nConstraint\n40%\n\n20%\n\n0%\n4,000\n\n4,500\n\n5,000\n\n5,500\n\n6,000\n\n6,500\n\n7,000\n\n7,500\n\nLanding Field Length (ft)\n\nFigure 73: CDF Plot of Landing Field Length\n\nFigure 74 shows the CDF plot for the required takeoff field length.

This is evident by the steeper slope of the new CDF plot of\nthe metric. Although the improvement with the technology infusion enables 100% feasibility of\nthe design with respect to the year 2007 constraint, these resultant improvements are still\ninadequate to enable the design to fully meet the required constraint emission value of 228 lb for\nthe year 2022. Even with the infusion of the selected technologies, the design is just 30% feasible\nagainst that year 2022 constraint value.\n100%\n90%\n\nConstraint 2022\n\nPercent Feasibility\n\n80%\n\nConstraint 2007\n\n70%\n\nNo Technologies\n\n60%\n50%\n40%\n30%\n20%\n\nTechnologies\nImplemented\n\n10%\n0%\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n300\n\n350\n\n400\n\n450\n\n500\n\n550\n\n600\n\n650\n\nNOx (lb)\n\nFigure 76: CDF Plot of NOx\n\nAs can be seen from the Figure 77, the infusion of the selected technologies has improved the\ntakeoff gross weight of the design. Although the original plot without the technology infusion\nalready shows 100% feasibility against the target gross weight of 175,000 lb, the infusion of the\nnew technologies enables the design to achieve a much better performance. The variability of the\nmetric performance is reduced a bit, as can be concluded from the steeper new plot slope\ncompared to the original plot, and the infusion of the technologies also shifted the original plot to\nfurther left of the feasible design space. As a rough comparison, without the technology infusion,\nthe lightest gross weight that can be achieved by the design is about 143,000 lb, which is a\ndefinite 100% possibility with the new technologies since the heaviest design weight recorded\nwith the technologies implementation is only 123,000 lb.\n100%\n90%\n\nPercent Feasibility\n\n80%\n\nConstraint\n\n70%\n60%\n50%\n\nTechnologies\nImplemented\n\n40%\n\nNo Technologies\n\n30%\n20%\n10%\n0%\n100,000\n\n110,000\n\n120,000\n\n130,000\n\n140,000\n\n150,000\n\n160,000\n\n170,000\n\nTakeoff Gross Weight (lbf)\n\nFigure 77: CDF Plot of Takeoff Gross Weight\n\nPage 125\n\n180,000\n\nDeliverable #5 \xe2\x80\x93 Complete Report\nThe infusion of the new technologies has been found to negatively affect the acquisition price of\nthe design. As can be seen from the CDF plot in Figure 78, the implementation of these\ntechnologies on the design will increase the acquisition price. This is opposing the intention of\nminimizing the aircraft price as much as possible. The resultant situation is reasonably inevitable\nsince the implementation of new technologies obviously will increase the costs of the design as\nbeing discussed in previous section. Based on the plots, the cheapest price that can be achieved\nfor the design with the implementation of all the selected technologies is about $60.8 million.\n100%\n90%\n\nPercent Feasibility\n\n80%\n\nNo Technologies\n\n70%\n60%\n50%\n40%\n\nTechnologies\nImplemented\n\n30%\n20%\n10%\n0%\n56\n\n58\n\n60\n\n62\n\n64\n\n66\n\n68\n\n70\n\nAcquisition Price (M$)\n\nFigure 78: CDF Plot of Acquisition Price\n\nFigure 79 shows that, with the implementation of the selected technologies, the overall RDT&E\ncosts for the design will be further decreased from the original value. This condition is well\naligned with the notion of minimizing the costs as much as possible. This situation may occur\ndue to the reduction of the design cycle time and expensive experimental testing, which is due to\nthe infusion of several of the selected technologies. With the technology infusion, the highest\nRDT&E costs that can be expected is about $4,800 million; a very much reduced amount\ncompared to the value of that without the technologies, which is approximately at $5,025\nmillion.\nRDT&E Feasibility\n100%\n90%\n\nPercent Viability\n\n80%\n70%\n\nTechnologies\nImplemented\n\n60%\n50%\n40%\n\nNo Technologies\n\n30%\n20%\n10%\n0%\n4,300\n\n4,400\n\n4,500\n\n4,600\n\n4,700\n\n4,800\n\n4,900\n\nRDT&E (M$)\n\nFigure 79: CDF Plot of RDT&E Costs\n\nPage 126\n\n5,000\n\n5,100\n\nDeliverable #5 \xe2\x80\x93 Complete Report\nAs for the required yield per revenue passenger-mile ($/RPM) metric, the technologies infusion\nalso helped to improve the design.

From 0% feasibility, the infusion of the selected technologies has shifted the plot into the\nfeasible design space, with 95% feasibility against the target value of 3.95925 cents/ASM for the\nyear 2007. As can be seen from the plot, the infusion of the technology does not just improve the\nmetric performance by shifting the plot to the left of the target line but also reduces the\nvariability of the metric performance. This is evident by the steeper slope of the new CDF plot of\nthe metric. However, these resultant improvements are still inadequate to enable the design to\nmeet the required constraint value of 2.6395 cents/ASM for the year 2022. Even with the\ninfusion of the selected technologies, the design is still 0% feasible against that year 2022\nconstraint value. This is shown on the same plot where the lowest costs that can be achieved by\nthe technology infusion is only about 3.78 cents/ASM.\n100%\n\nConstraint 2022\n\n90%\n\nConstraint 2007\n\nPercent Feasibility\n\n80%\n70%\n60%\n\nTechnologies\nImplemented\n\n50%\n\nNo Technologies\n\n40%\n30%\n20%\n10%\n0%\n2.5\n\n3.0\n\n3.5\n\n4.0\n\n4.5\n\n5.0\n\n5.5\n\n6.0\n\nDOC+I (cents/ASM)\n\nFigure 82: CDF Plot of Direct Operating Costs + Interest\n\nIt can be said that the infusion of the new technologies has improved all the performance and\neconomics metrics of the design, with the exception of the acquisition costs. Although the\ngoverning design space metrics, which are the CO2/ASM, NOx and the DOC+I, are not entirely\nsatisfied for the year 2022 constraints, little can be done to deal with that situation. One of the\noptions to satisfy these metrics requirements is by revising the selected technologies for\nimplementation.\nThe degradation in the acquisition price metric can be said to be well justified with the great\nimprovement in the overall design performance with the help of the technologies infusion and\nthe reduction in operation costs. Therefore, the selection of technology alternatives for the design\nis a good selection.\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe focus of this study was to use the TIES methodology to determine the feasibility and\nviability of a 150 passenger commercial aircraft and to study the effects of technology infusion\nto open up the feasible design space. The main objective was to identify which technologies\nwould be necessary to overcome the established constraints.\nPage 128\n\nDeliverable #5 \xe2\x80\x93 Complete Report\nThe requirements of the system were defined in the design metrics and their target values.\nRanges for the variables that are under the designers\xe2\x80\x99 control were determined to create\nResponse Surface Equations to model how the variables affect the design metrics. A Monte\nCarlo Simulation of 10,000 random cases was used to create CDFs, which allowed the design\nteam to determine if the design was feasible and, if feasible, whether it was viable. This study\nshowed that the emissions and DOC+I constraints could not be met by the baseline design.\nIn order to open up the design space, a technology study was performed. The first step was to\ndetermine how the 36 technologies identified affected the design variables (k-factors). A full\nfactorial DoE was used to formulate RSEs that could model all possible technology\ncombinations. By using TOPSIS, Technology Frontiers, and Technology Sensitivities the best\nfamily of all the technologies was chosen. This created a new aircraft alternative and the new\ndesign space was studied with the applied technologies. The study led to a new set of RSEs, for\nwhich a Monte Carlo Analysis was performed to determine the feasibility and viability of the\nnew system.\nFourteen technologies were needed to create a feasible and viable design space for the 2007\nconstraints. It was previously determined, while the k-factors were studied, that the constraints\nfor the year 2022 would not be met with the identified technologies. If this project was directed\nto a manufacturer, the group would recommend investing in only some of the fourteen needed\ntechnologies. The manufacturer would then need to request from the government research\nprograms to develop the rest. Table LVIII summarizes the technologies concluded to be\nnecessary for the new design in order to meet the constraints.\nTable LVIII: Technologies Needed to Meet 2007 Constraints\nID #\n\nT1\nT6\nT7\nT10\nT11\nT20\nT21\nT26\nT27\nT28\nT29\nT30\nT34\nT35\nT36\n\nTechnology Description\n\nAdaptive Performance Optimization (APO)\nAirframe Methods\nFire Suppression\nPropulsion System Health Management\nSmart Nacelle \xe2\x80\x93 Propulsion-Airframe Integration (PAI)\nAdaptive Engine Control System (ADECS)\nRevolutionary Metallic Materials Systems on Fuselage Structure\nLiving Aircraft\nActive Load Alleviation on Tail\nActive Load Alleviation on Wing\nAntenna Systems\nAdaptive Wing Shaping\nBIOSANT on Fuselage Structure\nBIOSANT on Tail Structure\nBIOSANT on Wing Structure\n\nPage 129\n\nCurrent\nTRL\n9\n4\n3\n2\n3\n4\n2\n2\n4\n4\n2\n3\n1\n1\n1\n\nTRL=9\nDate\n2000\n2007\n2007\n2009\n2009\n2011\n2013\n2013\n2013\n2013\n2014\n2014\n2015\n2015\n2015\n\nDeliverable #5 \xe2\x80\x93 Complete Report\n\nPROJECT WORK PLAN ASSESSMENT\nThe initial plan for team in approaching this project was basically to go through the working\nprocess of each step requirements in a sequential manner. This can be seen from the initial\nproject planning Gantt Chart, shown in Figure 83. However, as the team went through the\nproject requirements, the time necessary for each step slightly changed from the time allocated.\nSteps 1-5 were performed as planned in the Gantt Chart. For Step 6, the requirements were\nfound to be independent from each other and the team was able to work on each of these\nrequirements at the same time when doing the requirements in Step 4. After establishing the\nneeded optimized baseline parameters, the team decided that two of team members will do the\nfeasibility and the viability study of the design respectively and the other will start on Step 6\nrequirements concurrently. This allowed for the team to jump into Step 7 sooner. Some mistakes\ntook place, but with the extra time, Deliverable 4 was turned in on time.\nSince some of the deliverable due dates were postponed, the team deviated from the proposed\ntime schedule. The write up for Steps 6-7 was extended an extra week and the final report was\ndue three days after the initial due date. Because of this, the team had less time to do Step 8.\nThe team also did not start preparation of the presentation until December 2, only allowing for\nfour days to get the slide show ready. After the presentation was complete, the team then\nfocused on the final report. This was complete on December 9. Although the team did not\nfollow the time schedule, all of the requirements were met on time.\nThis project has helped the team in realizing a new approach in the sizing and synthesis process\nof an aircraft design as compared to the traditional approach. The TIES methodology, which is\nthe main backbone of this project, gives more flexibility in assessing numerous design\npossibilities concurrently in less time than if was done through the conventional process. The\nmethodology also allows for visualization and permits a structured approach in assessing new\ntechnologies into the design to achieve the target or constraint goals established for the design.\nThe TIES methodology is a universally structured approach for a conceptual and preliminary\ndesign process. The process can be applied to other complex systems. However, this\nmethodology depends on the availability of analysis codes to assess a given complex system,\nwhich restrains its application. For the purpose of this project, FLOPS & ALCCA were available\nas sizing and synthesis tools. For use on another complex system, tools may not be as readily\navailable.\nBoth FLOPS and ALCCA require the user to be familiar with most of its inputs. As first time\nusers, the members of the design team had difficulties in identifying all the input variables that\nhad to be modified, added, or removed from the input files. We encountered problems in some\nof the cases run in which FLOPS or ALCCA crashed. The inexperience of the team members\nmade it difficult to understand what factors caused it to crash.\n\nPage 130\n\nDeliverable #5 \xe2\x80\x93 Complete Report\nWeek 1 Week 2 Week 3 Week 4 Week 5 Week 6 Week 7 Week 8 Week 9 Week 10 Week 11 Week 12\nRequirements\nDetailed GANTT chart of the Project\nStep 1 - Problem Definition\nDefine need for aircraft, potential markets and competitors\nDefine system level metrics and their importance\nIdentify target/constraint for metrics of interest\nStep 2 - Baseline and Alternative Concepts Identification\nMorphological analysis\nDefine Baseline concept and 3-view\nDefine ranges for the design variables\nStep 3 - Modeling and Simulation\nDefine mission for sizing of aircraft and optimization segments\nDefine assumptions used for sizing and evaluating aircraft\nEngine performance analysis, baseline drag polars\nAnalysis of airframe manufacturer information\nAnalysis of airline information\nWrite-Up of Report Containing Steps 1, 2, and 3\nStep 4 - Design Space Exploration\nEstablish datum values for metrics of interest\nUse of DoE for RSE (Describe and define terms and methods)\nStudy sensitivity of the response to the design parameters\nPerform accuracy and goodness tests\nDesign Plots comparison with constraints and analysis\nMonte Carlo Simulation on RSEs\nComparison of CDFs with and without error\nStep 5 - Determine System Feasibility and Viability\nCheck CDFs for feasibility\nEvaluate optimized configuration\nEconomic variables identification\nDevelop RSEs for economic metrics\nRun Monte Carlo Simulation and obtain CDFs and PDFs\nModification of shape functions and corresponding analysis\nWrite-Up of Report Containing Steps 4 and 5\nStep 6 - Specify Technology Alternatives\nSelection of technologies and description of each\nDescribe current research of technologies\nProvide a series of TCMs for each year between 2006 to 2016\nStep 7 - Assess Technology Alternatives\nCreation of RSEs as functions of technology impact factors\nAnalysis of RSEs created\nCreate annual decision matrices\nWrite-Up of Report Containing Steps 6 and 7\nStep 8 - Select Best Family of Alternatives\nAnalyze different scenarios in TOPSIS\nProvide equations for economic and performance frontiers\nEstablish threshold limits\nPlot PE versus EE for 2007 to 2016\nEstablish Objective Functions and weighting scenarios (GA)\nCompare results\nComparison of technologies to baseline metrics\nClosing the Loop - Reinvestigate the Design Space\nChose best two combinations of technologies\nRepeat procedures to obtain CDFs\nCompare new CDFs with the ones previously obtained\nWrite-Up of Final Report\nFinal Presentation Contribution\n\n09/15-9/21\n\n09/22-09/28\n\n09/29-10/05\n\n10/06-10/12\n\n10/13-10/19\n\n10/20-10/26\n\n10/27-11/02\n\n11/03-11/09\n\n11/10-11/16\n\n11/17-11/23\n\n11/24-11/30\n\n12/01-12/07\n\nFigure 83: Gantt Chart\n\nFor future projects, it would be helpful to know the logics behind the tools that create their\nacceptance. This will enhance the knowledge about this methodology and opens up to other\npossibilities of approaching this methodology.\nThe workload associated with this project could be considered acceptable for experienced users.\nHowever, first time users tend to require extra time for iteration when corrections have to be\nmade.\nThe TIES methodology would be a lot more effective with a complete integrated interface. This\nintegrated interface would allow the user to use the sizing analysis code and the statistical\nanalysis code by simply supplying one set of inputs. More ideas related to this can be discussed\nindividually with the member of the design group.\n\nPage 131\n\nDeliverable #5 \xe2\x80\x93 Complete Report\n\nAPPENDIX A\nTable AI: Sizing Assumptions\nFLOPS\nData Name\n\nParameter\n1.Geometric, Weight, Balance & Inertia Data\nMax.
