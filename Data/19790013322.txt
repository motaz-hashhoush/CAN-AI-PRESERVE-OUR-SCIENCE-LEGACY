Ohio 43210\nIn order to use gravity anomalies in geodetic\ncomputations and geophysical interpretations,\nthe observed gravity values from which anomalies are derived should be referred to one consistent world wide system. We are very fortunate that we have one unique reference system\navailable. The International Gravity Standardization Net 1971 was adapted by the International\nUnion of Geodesy and Geophysics at Moscow in\n1971 [Morelli, et al, 1974]. The network was a\nresult of extensive cooperation by many organizations and individuals around the world. The\nfinal results were produced by a small subgroup\nof Special Study Group No. 5 of the International\nAssociation of Geodesy. This network contains\nmore than 1800 stations around the world. The\ndata used in the adjustment included more than\n25,000 gravimeter, pendulum and absolute\nmeasurements. It was claimed that "standard\nerrors for IGSN 71 gravity values are less than\n\xc2\xb10. 1 mgal. " It certainly was a tremendous\nimprovement over the old "Potsdam system. "\nAt the XVIth General Assembly of the International A ssociation of Geodesy in 1975 a resolution was passed, and Working Group No. 2:\n"World Gravity Standards" was established to\nmaintain the IGSN as the international gravity\nreference standard and to provide advice and\nassistance to the International Gravity Bureau in\nproblems related to gravity standards. The\nEarth Physics Branch of Energy, Mines and\nResources in Canada was requested to set up a\ntechnical service for the maintenance of IGSN.\nThis service involves the use of existing EPB\nfacilities to maintain a data bank of observations\nrelated to IGSN, and station descriptions. New\ndata will be transmitted to EPB through the\nInternational Gravity Bureau in Paris, who \xe2\x80\xa2will\nalso act as the central distribution agency for\nrevised IGSN information.\nAs you might be well aware, there have been\nmany new absolute measurements of gravity\nsince the adoption of IGSN 71. The most extensive comparison of the new absolute measurements and the IGSN 7 1 values was reported by\nCannizzo, Gerotti and Marson [l978 ]. They\nreported results of 25 absolute gravity measurements carried out at 17 stations in Europe using\nnew Italian transportable apparatus in 1976 and\n1977.\nThey concluded that the accuracy of the\nnew absolute measurements is 10 p gal.

Most of the\ngravity differences are less than 0. 1 mgal,\nwhich was the claimed accuracy for IGSN 7 1\ngravity values. It seems that there is no linear\nscale difference but some local systematic\ndifferences.\nDuring 1977 Marson and Alasia [1978] measured absolute gravity at six stations in the U.S.A.\nThe preliminary analyses of the results show a\ngood agreement.with IGSN 71 values. There\nhave been also other absolute measurements\nsuch as Hammond, et al [ 1978] and Arnautov, et\nal [1977]. All comparisons have shown reasonable agreements between new absolute values and\nthe IGSN 71 values.\nThe effect of new absolute gravity measurements in the IGSN 7 1 values have been studied\n[Uotila, 1978]. From these studies it has been\nconcluded that it is not useful to make a global\nreadjustment of the IGSN 7 1 in the near future.\nThe IGSN 71 serves as a good standard for\nrelating gravity measurements to the absolute\nsystem in world wide bases as far as computations of mean anomalies and production of\ngravity anomaly maps are concerned. The\nWorking Group No. 2 has further recommended\nthat the IGSN 7 1 values should not be fixed in new\nlocal, national or continental adjustments, but\nentered properly weighted using their variancecovariance matrix.\nThere has been some discussion to produce\ngravity station networks, where the accuracy of\nthe gravity values would be about 10 fXgal. If we\nwish to have that level accuracy of the gravity\nvalues in a network, we must have much more\naccurate measurements of gravity differences\nbetween the stations than currently are available\nor have many more measurements of gravity\nwith a good absolute apparatus. In order to\nimprove the accuracy in measurements of gravity\ndifferences, we must establish good calibration\nlines with more accurate gravity values than\ncurrently are available. We have to observe or\nmodel also gravity variations caused by local and\nglobal environmental factors, such as tides,\nwater level, etc. There is much to be done\nbefore we can have a large net of gravity stations\nwith 10 n gal accuracy.\nReferences\nArnautov, G.
