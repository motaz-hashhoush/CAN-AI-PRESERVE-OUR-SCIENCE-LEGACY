The influence of Mach number, Reynolds number, and degree of turbulence were taken into account. The optimization aimed at maximum pressure increase, minimum pressure loss, low Reynolds number dependence, or large angle-of-attack range. Starting from the boundary layer form parameter distribution (by which transition point and separation point can be controlled) the velocity distribition and the contour were calculated. The profile characteristics were tested off-design and were improved. Interferometric measurements were performed in the transonic cascade channel.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19880012942, "id": "76340f46d68a436fbef8e288d6a1ab04", "publicationDate": "1988-04-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
