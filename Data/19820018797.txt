Cone 31 cooperates within a slotted collar and 21: comprising a plurality of tangs 22 on cylindrical fastener body D. The fastener is sett by inserting it through aligned holes in workpi,eces D and C\nto be joined. Turning pin E in one direction draws cone~ 31 into collar 21\ndeforming tangs 22 radially outward to mate with baok-tapered hold 12 in\nworkpiece C, thus fastan,ing workpieces 8 and C together. Reversing the\ndirection of pin E withdraws cone 31 from collar 21, allowing tangs 22\nto resume their contracted configuration upon withdrawing the fastener\nfrom the insertion hole.\n\nA\n\nThe novelty of the invention appears to lie in its particular two element\t\ncaptive configuration and its ability to join materials together from only\none side with substantial strength in tension and shear over many reuse\nAttachment cycles, and with no special operations on tho main assembly\nparts other than the tapering of the back end of the insertion hole.\n\ni\n\ni\ni:.\n\nInventor:\t\n\nScott A.

The outer surface\n\n25\n\nof the body, intermediately, is provided with an annular\nlip which is flaired to securely underly a chamfer or\nrecess in the removable work piece so that the fastener\nremains captive in the latter even when freed from the\nfixed work piece. An expander pin is internally threaded\n\n30\n\nin and through the body and has a wrenching socket in its\nouter end and an expander cone at its remote end which\nmay be actuated, upon rotation of the pin, to expand the\nbody tangs against the beveled, remote corner of the wall\nof the accommodating bore in the fixed work piece to\n\n35\n\neffect secure fastening together of the work pieces. The\nouter work piece with the fastener unit captive therewith\n\nyt,\n\n-3\nmay be removed by reverse rotation of the pin to cause\n\nthe expansion cane to withdraw from the body tangs which\nthen relax to permit withdrawal of the fastener unit.\n\nBrief Description of the Drawings\n\n5\t\n\nIn the accompanying drawings,\nFig. 1 is a longitudinal center section through the\nnovel fastener operatively assembled with work pieces.\nFig. 2 is a similar section showing the body tangs\nrelaxed for insertion and withdrawal of the fastener.\n\nio\t\n\nFig. 3 is a partial longitudinal center section\n\nthrough the inner or remote portion of the body with the\nexpansion tabs relaxed, and\nFig. 4 is an enlarged, partial,.cross section taken\n\non the corresponding section line of Fig. 3.\n\n15\t\n\nDetail Description - of the Ora wings\n\nFig. 1 shows the novel fastener unit, generally\ndesignated A, operatively assembled with outer removable\nand inner fixed work pieces B and C. Work piece B has\na bore 10 with a remote corner chamfer 11 and fixed work\n20\t\n\npiece C has a somewhat smaller bore 10a and a larger\nremote corner chamfer or diverging countersink 12. Both\nchamfers can be formed by suitable tools inserted through\nbores 10 and 10a, if necessary.\nThe fastener unit A comprises a body D with an outer\n\n25\t\n\nhead 13 overlying removable work piece B, and a hollow\nshank including an outer portion 14 with an intern %al\n\nthread 15, and a reduced skirt portion 16. The shank\nportion 14 exteriorly terminates in a shoulder 17\nbetween shank portions 14 and 16.\t\nso\t\n\nThe shoulder is partly\n\nsevered axially, as at 19 (Fig.3), for flairing, as at\n17a in Figs. 1 and 2, as will be explained. \t\n\nPortions 16\n\nof the body shank beyond threading 15, is reduced both\ninternally and externally.\nThe collar-like inner extremity 21 of the body shank\n35\t\n\nis slightly thicker than adjacent part 16 and consists of\n\n-4-\n\na plurality of individual tangs 22 formed from the body\nmaterial by axial cuts 23 and small radial holes 24 at the\nends of the slots. The body, preferably, is formed of metal\nwhich is tempered at its lower extremity to provide spring\ns\t\n\nmetal quality\n\nin\n\nthe small sections connecting tangs 22 and\n\nthe adjacent shank part 16 whereby the tangs will be normally resiliently biased to their relaxed positions, as\n\nin\n\nFigs. 2 and 3. At the upper ends, of tangs 22, portion 21\n\n1\n\nis provided with internal annular recessing 25 which colo\t\n\noperates\n\nwith\n\nthe spring resilience of the tangs in re-\n\nlaxing of the latter when the fastner is to be released.\nRadial bores 24 provide stress relief in the hinging portion of the tangs.\nBroadly, the hinging of tangs 22 is not, necessarily,\nis\t\n\nresilient, but may be merely flexible, and body A may be\nmade of other materials, as plastics. \t\n\nIt is contemplated\n\nhowever, that the tangs may be expanded and contracted\nmany times,\nReceived in body A is the expansion\n20,\t\n\npin\n\nE with its\n\nouter threaded portion 27 meshing with body threads 15. A\n\nwrench socket 28 providers for rotating the pin to propel\nthe same longitudinally within body A.\n?, reduced portion 29 of the pin is adjacent threaded\nportion 27 thereof and forms the shoulder 30 therewith.\n25\t\n\nAt the extreme inner end of the pin is the expander cone\n\n31.\n\nOperation\nIn order to install the fastener, work pieces B and\nC are first bored and bevelled, as at 10, 10a, 11, and 12.\n30\t\n\nFastener unit A with body D and expander pin E assembled\nis then installed in outer work piece bore 10 and lip\n17a flaired with a suitable tool to snugly grip edge\nbevel 11 to hold the fastener unit captive. Other means,\nsuch as embedding the flair 17a in a differently located\n\n35\t\n\nrecess in bore 10, may be used to secure the fastener in\n\nt:.\n\n\t\n\n-5removable work piece B.\nThe joined fastener A and movable work piece B are\nthen assembled with fixed work piece C with the work\npieces abutting and fastener body D snugly fitting bores\n5\t\n\n10 and 10a.\t\n\nPin E will be screwed into body D of the\n\nfastener merely far enough to cause the inner extremity\nof the cone 31 to approach or contact the free extremities\nof tangs 22 (fig. 2).\nWith the tangs resiliently biased, they will converge\n\nto\t\n\nslightly\n\nin the relaxed position, being limited by\n\nengagement with reduced pin portion 29 just above cone 31.\nIn order to secure\n\nthe\n\nassembly, piti E is rotated to\n\ncause the cone to enter the tanged collar 21 and expand\ntangs into firm engagement into undercut 12. To remove\nis\t\n\nouter work piece 6 and captive fastener A, pin E\n\nis\n\nrotated in the opposite direction, propelling cone 31 out\nof collar 21, relaxing the tangs to permit withdrawal of\nthe fastener unit from bore 10a without damaging or otherwise affecting any of the parts, either of the work\n\n20\t\n\npieces or the fastener.\nThe fastener parts will remain threadedly assembled\nin a one-piece assembly and this assembly will remain\ncaptive in removable work piece Q until disassembled, as\nby straightening of flaired lip 17a.\n\n25\t\n\nThe invention may be modified in various respects\n\nas will occur to those skilled in the art and the\nexclusive use of all modifications as come within the\nscope of the appended claims is contemplated.\n\n^P\n\nABSTRACT OF THE DISCLOSURE\n\nA ona-piece blind fastener self-retained in a\ndetachable work piece B and capable of repeated removals\nfrom and reinstalations in the fixed work piece C.\n\nf\nE\n\nORIGINAL PACE i3\nOF POOR QUALITY\n\n27\t\n\nA\n\nFIG. l\n+.f\n11:'\t\n\n=4\n\ns\n\nORIGMAL flilvi \xe2\x96\xba; 13\nOF POOR QUALITY\n\nFIG. 2\n/:1\n\nOF POOR QUALITY\n\nF/\n\ncr\n\n24\n\n6\n25 2/\n\n^22\nn\t\n\n'^W\n\nFIG. 4\n\n"
