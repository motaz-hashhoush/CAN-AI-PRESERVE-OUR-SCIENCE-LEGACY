The oxygen must be concentrated out of\nthe atmosphere, or created out of carbon dioxide (which makes\nup most of the atmosphere) or dihydrogen monoxide (water),\nfor humans to use in order to survive on the surface.\nThe thinner atmosphere on Mars allows more radiation to reach\nthe surface than Earth.\nA reliable source of water close to or at the surface, and the\nability to obtain, purify, and recycle the water, is needed for any\nhuman habitat on Mars to be sustainable\nIf the crew needs a part they cannot make on the surface of\nMars, it will take at least 6 months to receive the part from\nEarth. Resupply missions will take at least 6 months to arrive\nfrom Earth.\nIt takes between 4 minutes and 24 minutes (depending on the\npositions of Earth and Mars as they orbit the Sun) to transmit\nphone signals between Earth and Mars.\n\n'
