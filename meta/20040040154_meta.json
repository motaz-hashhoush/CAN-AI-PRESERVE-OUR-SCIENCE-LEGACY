To achieve these objectives, NASA 757 flight test research was conducted at the Eagle-Vail, Colorado airport to evaluate three SVS display types (Head-Up Display, Head-Down Size A, Head-Down Size X) and two terrain texture methods (photo-realistic, generic) in comparison to the simulated Baseline Boeing-757 Electronic Attitude Direction Indicator and Navigation / Terrain Awareness and Warning System displays. These independent variables were evaluated for situation awareness, path error, and workload while making approaches to Runway 25 and 07 and during simulated engine-out Cottonwood 2 and KREMM departures. The results of the experiment showed significantly improved situation awareness, performance, and workload for SVS concepts compared to the Baseline displays and confirmed the retrofit capability of the Head-Up Display and Size A SVS concepts. The research also demonstrated that the pathway and pursuit guidance used within the SVS concepts achieved required navigation performance (RNP) criteria.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20040040154, "endDate": "2003-11-19T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Inst. of Aeronautics and Astronautics", "location": "United States"}}, "meetingId": "3ba3a2ca6297429c95ff9031459c14fa", "id": "6cb3bc8cd42d417f80176c416deaf2e5"}], "name": "AIAA''s 3rd Annual Aviation Technology, Integration and Operations Technical Forum", "location": "Denver, CO", "id": "3ba3a2ca6297429c95ff9031459c14fa", "startDate": "2003-11-17T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20040040154, "id": "df73089e9a634372a2729c41ced4bfb1", "publicationDate": "2003-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20040040154.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20040040154/downloads/20040040154.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20040040154/downloads/20040040154.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20040040154/downloads/20040040154.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
