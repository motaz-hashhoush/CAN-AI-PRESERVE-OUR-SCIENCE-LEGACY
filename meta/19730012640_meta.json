Analysis of the two sets of experimental data for isolated events led to the classification of high latitude field-aligned currents as purely temporal or purely spatial variations. Magnetic field disturbances calculated using these simple current models and the measured particle fluxes were in good agreement with measured field values. While fluxes of greater than 1 keV electrons are detected primarily on the nightside, magnetometer disturbances indicative of field-aligned currents were seen at all local times, both in the visual auroral regions and dayside polar cusp. Thus electrons with energies less than approximately 1 keV are the prime charge carriers in high latitude dayside field-aligned currents. The satellite measurements are in good agreement with previously measured field-aligned current values and with values predicted from several models involving magnetospheric field-aligned currents.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19730012640, "id": "9c44e5c4b4254914905240b4a7523cf4", "publicationDate": "1973-04-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19730012640.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19730012640/downloads/19730012640.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19730012640/downloads/19730012640.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19730012640/downloads/19730012640.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
