Three Skylab earth resources passes over Puerto Rico and St. Croix on 6 June and 30 November 1973 and 18 January 1974 resulted in color photography and multispectral photography and scanner imagery. Bathymetric and turbid water features are differentiable by use of the multispectral data. Photography allows mapping of coral reefs, offshore sand deposits, areas of coastal erosion, and patterns of sediment transport. Bottom sediment types could not be differentiated. Patterns of bottom dwelling biologic communities are well portrayed but are difficult to differentiate from bathymetric detail. Effluent discharges and oil slicks are readily detected and are differentiated from other phenomena by the persistence of their images into the longer wavelength multispectral bands.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19760020543, "id": "d1be4419867142c8b0979bd857c138c1", "publicationDate": "1975-10-15T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19760020543.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19760020543/downloads/19760020543.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19760020543/downloads/19760020543.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19760020543/downloads/19760020543.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
