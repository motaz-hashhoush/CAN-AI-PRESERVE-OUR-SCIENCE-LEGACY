DrEAM  being  the  first  competed mission to fly EDL instrumentation as part of NASA\u2019s Engineering Science Investigation (ESI).DrEAM will provide key aerothermodynamicdata and performance analysisfor  Dragonfly\u2019s  forebody  and  backshell  therma lprotection system (TPS),and also includes a DLR-provided Data Acquisition System(DAS).Titan\u2019s atmosphere predominantly consists of nitro-gen (~98%  by  mole) with  small  amounts  of  methane(~2% by mole)and other trace gases. CN is a strong ra-diator and is found in nonequilibriumconcentrationsfor Titan  entry. The accurate modeling  of  nonequilibrium CN radiation has proven to be a difficult task. Prompted by the Huygensmission, many experimental campaigns and analyses  were  performed to  better  understand  the aerothermal environments experience by the probe dur-ing Titan entry[1].However, the Huygens probe carried no  heatshieldinstrumentation.  Therefore,the  DrEAM instrumentation suite will significantly  advance  the state-of-the-art  not  only  by  documenting  theenviron-ment and performance of Dragonfly\u2019sentry system but also  by  making  keymeasurements  in  Titan\u2019s  atmos-phere for thefirst time, thus providing new benchmark dataapplicable to entry science more generally.\n\nCurrent Measurement Goals:\nAerothermal  envi-ronments and TPS responsewill be measured using sen-sors similarto the Mars Entry, Descent, and Landing In-strumentation2  (MEDLI2)  Integrated  Sensor  Plug(MISP) and the COMbined Aerothermaland Radiome-ter Sensor (COMARS)suite[2], with the latter supplied by DLR.For MEDLI2, MISP usedembedded thermo-couples (TCs) todirectly measure in-depth temperature of theTPS at several locations,which can also be used to infer surface environmentsvia inverse analysis. For DrEAM, the MISPstyle plugswill be known as Drag-onfly Sensors for Aero-Thermal Reconstruction (Drag-STR)plugs. On  Schiaparelli,  the  COMARSsuite  in-cludedthree  total  surface-mounted  heatflux  sensors, three   pressure sensors,   and   one   radiometer.   For DrEAM,  the  COMARS  package  will  be  known  as COmbined Sensor System for Titan Atmosphere (COSSTA). Atmospheric  density  measurements  and capsuleaerodynamic data will be obtained throughthe onboard  Inertial  Measurement  Unit  (IMU),supple-mented by pressure transducers similar tothose used by the  MEDLI  Mars  Entry  AtmosphericData  System (MEADS).The DrEAM pressure sensors will be known as Dragonfly Atmospheric Flight Transducers(DrAFT) Both DragSTR and DrAFThave flight heritagefrom MISP  and  MEADS  on the  MSLand  Mars  2020mis-sions, and the COMARS suite successfullyflew on the ESA Schiaparelli EDMlander. A preliminary layout of the sensors is shown in Fig. 1. Because Dragonflyuses the same aeroshell provider (i.e., LockheedMartin) and materials for the TPS,with what are expected to be sim-ilar thicknesses as MSL and Mars 2020on both the heat shield  and  backshell,  theDrEAMinstrumentation  will look to utilize the same techniques and processes as de-veloped  byMEDLI  and  MEDLI2for  vehicle  integra-tion. This  commonality  alsoenables DrEAMto  lever-age the extensiveground test qualifications performed forMEDLI and MEDLI2 and claim substantial heritagefor this system.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "US", "submissionId": 20210013721, "endDate": "2021-08-24T07:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"organizationId": "a25cc56567355a4ea518b280a66764ae", "meta": {"organization": {"name": "Analytical Mechanics Associates (United States)", "location": "Hampton, Virginia, United States"}}, "meetingId": "ea9377b48b434d2eb899893862e598bb", "id": "9fedc316322d4b2b8fdcd2aeeae5063c"}], "name": "IPPW", "location": "Virtual", "id": "ea9377b48b434d2eb899893862e598bb", "url": "ippw21.org", "startDate": "2021-06-17T07:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "IPPW-2021-Abstract-DrEAM-v1.pdf", "type": "ABSTRACT", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20210013721/downloads/IPPW-2021-Abstract-DrEAM-v1.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20210013721/downloads/IPPW-2021-Abstract-DrEAM-v1.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20210013721/downloads/IPPW-2021-Abstract-DrEAM-v1.pdf.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
