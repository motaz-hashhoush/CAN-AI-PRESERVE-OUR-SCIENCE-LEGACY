A roll of aerial imagery consisting of Kodak film types SO-397 and 2443 was contact printed onto Cibachrome and Kodak materials and compared in terms of color quality, resolution, cost, and compatibility with existing equipment and techniques. Objective measurements are given in terms of resolution and sensitometric response. Comparison prints and transparencies were viewed and ranked according to overall quality and aesthetic appeal. It is recommended that Cibachrome Print material be used in place of Kodak Ektachrome paper because it is more easily processed, the cost is equivalent, and it provides improved resolution, color quality, and image fade resistance.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "publications": [{"submissionId": 19750008729, "id": "bf895f31e6cd4e0bb65136b17972f034", "publicationDate": "1974-12-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19750008729.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19750008729/downloads/19750008729.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19750008729/downloads/19750008729.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19750008729/downloads/19750008729.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
