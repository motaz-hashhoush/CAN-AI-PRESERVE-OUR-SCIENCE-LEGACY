Over the past 35 years, X-ray astronomy has grown from infancy to near-maturity and is now an indispensable astrophysical tool. Constellation-X will transform this field from the exploratory spectroscopic era of Chandra and XMM to an era of fully comprehensive spectroscopic studies. The mission will consist of four 1.6-meter X-ray telescopes orbiting the Earth/Sun system. By providing a factor of 100 increase in throughput over previous missions, as well as high spectral resolution and a broad energy bandpass, Constellation-X will obtain high quality spectra for all classes of X-ray sources over a wide range of luminosity and redshift. It will study the warping of space and time near black holes, determine the distribution of ordinary matter, dark matter and dark energy, and probe detailed physical processes that occur at temperatures, densities and pressures far beyond those achievable in Earth-bound laboratories.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20040016324, "endDate": "2003-04-07T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "American Physical Society Meeting", "location": "Philadelphia, PA", "id": "fc84059cfb374e66adbb84594d05efee", "startDate": "2003-04-05T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20040016324, "id": "04bb8efa78bc44d2b5f37a765b4fcbab", "publicationDate": "2003-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
