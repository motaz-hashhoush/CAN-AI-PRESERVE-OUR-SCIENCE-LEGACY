Resch*\n\nABSTRACT: This paper will deal with two computer aid_\ndesign\nmethods for the design and construction\nof strong,\nlightweight\nstructures\nwhich require\ncomplex and precise\ngeometric\ndefinition.\nThe first,\nflexible\nstructures,\nis a unique system of modeling\nfolded plate structures\nand space frames.\nIn the latter\nit is\npossible\nto continuously\nvary the geometry of a space frame to\nproduce large,\nclear spans with curvature.\nThe second method\nc:eals with developable\nsurfaces\nahere both folding\nmid bending\nare explored with the observed constraint\nof available\nbuilding\nmaterials\nand what minimal distortion\nwould result\nin maximL_n\ndesign capability.\nWe are developing\nalternative\ninexpensive\nfabrication\ntechniques\nto achieve computer defined enclosures\nwhich are extremely lightweight\nand mathenmtically\nhighly\n\ni\n\nprecise.\nFolded Plate\n\nSystems\n\n_,\n\nMy discovery\nof kinematic\nfolded plate\nsystems,\nwhich ! term folded mosaic\nstructures,\nbegan some twelve years ago with a curiosity\nabout the dynamic behavior\nof a crumpled _ad of paper.\nAn extended observation\nled me to develop an operational procedure\nfor diagranlning\nthe bounding edges of what appeared to be the\nessential\nplates\ninvolved in the formation\nof an individual\nwrinkle.\nI have\ncreated diagrams of folded plate patterns\nwhich I subsequently\ncontinuous\npatterns\nby the use of symmetry operations.\n\nintegrated\n\ncomputer\n\nScience,\n\nunivorstity\n\ni\n\ninto\nI\n\nHundreds of these patterns\nhave been made and investigated.\nThe unique property\nof\neach is that,\nby allowing only folding of the sheet along the lines of the pattern,\na flat sheet may be transformed\ninto a variety\nof three dimensional\nshapes,\nFigure 1. These include domes, warped surfaces,\n_nd complex shells\ninvolwng\nboth.\nIt is also possible\nto create\nstructures\nwhich envelope a space by closing\nback on\nthemselves. An additional feature of each pattern is that the entire system is\ncomposedof the repetitionof a cmall number of non-identicalplates. For example,\nthe pattern\nshown has as few as two unique triangles\ngenerating\nthe entire\nsystem,\nFigure 2,\n* Associate Research Professor,\nSalt Lake City, Utah, U.S.A.\n\nl\n\n\'j\n\ni_\n,_\n\'._i\n\nof Utah,\n\n!\n209\n\n:%Ii\n\':!\'\n\n:_\n\n,\n\n_,\n\nAlthough\n\ni\n,\n\n;i\n"\n.\n\nmechanics and the kinematics\nof machine _y -- there has rarely\nbeen an exploration\nof geometric\nsystems of the type and to the extent\nof those I have conducted.\nThis\nwork is Imique in its discovery,\nand in its deveJopment\nof new kinematic\nsystems.\nMy initial\ninterest\nwas only to examine what sort of total\nsystem behavior\nresults\nwhen a specific\nconfiguration\nof geometry is brought together.\n\n....\n_\'\n\n,,\n\nthere\n\nhas been\n\nsome formal\n\nstudy\n\nin the\n\narea\n\nof kinematics\n\n-- namely,\n\n-\',\'. j\n\n_\'\n\nEarly investigation\nof how each moved.\n\n_\n/\n\xe2\x80\xa2\'\n,\n_ _ I\n_\n\'\n\nwhich a pattern\nhad been scribed.\nThe model was then moved by hand to change it\nfrom one shell form into another,\nFigure 3.
