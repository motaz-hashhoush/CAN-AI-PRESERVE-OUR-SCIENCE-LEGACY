The common mode signals\n.\nare indicated by dashed arrows in FIG. 2 The objective\nof the present invention is to filter the common mode\nnoise so that it does not appear at the dc source input\nterminals, while allowing the differential mode dc signal to pass unimpeded to the switching power supply\n\n5\n\n3.\n4\nThe coils 24 and 26 of the common mode inductor 22 10\nare oriented such that the flux produced by the coil 24\ncancels the flux produced by the coil 26 for a differential-mode signal. For a common-mode signal, the flux\nproduced by the coil 24 and the flux produced by the\ncoil 26 are additive; this flux addition gives the common 15\nmode inductor 22 a high impedance for common mode\nsignals. As a result, the coils 24 and 26 block the passage\nof the common mode noise from the switching power\nsupply 34 to the dc source 23. However, the coils 24 and\n26 allow the differential mode dc signal from the the dc 20\nsource 23 to pass through the common mode inductor\n22 to the switching power supply 3 .\n4\nTo further ensure the attenuation of the common\nmode noise produced by the switching power supply\n3 ,it is important to use feed through capacitors 30 and 25\n4\n36,rather than other capacitors types with the standard\nwell-known lead configurations. The feed-through ca6\npacitors 30 and 3 have short lead lengths and grounded\ncases that minimize parasitic inductance in the leads and\nforce the high frequency current to go through the\ncapacitor. Thus, the feed-through capacitors 30 and 36 30\noffer low impedance to high-frequency currents by\nvirtue of their construction. Further the filter 21, the\ncommon mode inductor 22, and the feed-through capacitors 30 and 36 are usually physically mounted in a\nsingle enclosure. The case grounding feature of the 35\n6\nfeed-through capacitors 30 and 3 can be used advantageously in this configuration to completely shield the.\ncomponents within the enclosure yet provide a terminal\nfor connection to the switching power supply 3 .\n4\nWithout the feed through capacitors 30 and 36,high 40\nfrequency noise from switching power supply 34 would\nleak through the coils 24 and 26 via the parasitic capacitances thereof. At higher frequencies, the parasitics\ncapacitances become even larger and provide an increasingly better path for the high frequency noise to 45\npass through.\nIn addition to the common-mode noise discussed\nabove, the switching power supply 34 also generates\nlow-frequency ripple differential noise, and its harmon50\nics.\nThe filter 21 is used to filter these low frequency\ndifferential noise components from entering the dc\nsource 23. These noise components cannot be sufficiently attenuated by the common-mode inductor 22.\nThe filter 21 is two well-known T-type filters connected 55\nat their bottom terminals, with this common connection\ngrounded.\nFIG. 3 illustrates another embodiment of the present\ninvention, specifically the filter 21 is illustrated as comprising two pi-type filters connected back to back. Here 60\nalso, the purpose of the filter 21 is to remove all the low\nfrequency differential noise components before they\nenter the dc source 23.The FIG.3 embodiment is typically used when the noise is measured using an inductive test set-up, e.g., commercial Federal Communica- 65\ntions Commission testing.\nAlthough several embodiments in accordance with\nthe present invention have been shown and described, it\n\n4\n\nis understood that the same is not limited thereto, but it\nis susceptable of numerous changes and modifications as\nknown to a person skilled in the art,and we therefore,\ndo not wish to be limited to the details shown and described herein, but intend to cover such changes and\nmodifications as are obvious to one of ordinary skill in\nthe art.\nWhat is claimed is:\n1.
