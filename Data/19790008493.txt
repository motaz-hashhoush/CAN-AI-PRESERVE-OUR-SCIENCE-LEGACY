Any changes\n\ndetected in these parameters as a function of time during the mission arse then attributable\nto surface contamination or to increased material absorption.\nThese basic functions are attained in the Optical Effects Module by virtue of the\nfollowing subsystems:\nModule Enclosure\n\nLight Source with Collimator and Nloduiator\nSample Wheel with Holders and Rotary Drive\nPhotomultipliers for Radiation Dutection\n\nProcessing and Sequencing Electronic Circuitry\nPower Conditioning Interfaces\nThe functions of these subsystems are revievied here and specified in more detail\nin this technical presentation.\nB\t\n\nMODULE ENCLOSURE\n\nThe Module Enclosure provides the housing for the optical instrumentation and\n\nfor the processing electronics. Furthermore, the outer surfaces of this enclosure are\n\n^\n\nr-\n\nADVANCED KINETICS,, INC.\nI}\nt\t\n\nt -1\n\nk\t\n\nI\n\ndesigned to stabilize the thermal excursions of the p-^c\'.;age and to reject heat \'into the\ncoupling rail of the I Ei A,1.\nThe\n\nbaseplate is 6 nim thick, aluminum\n\ntcolpial\n\n6C 61-T6 with provisions for\n\nbolting the same by means of sin 1/4-20 stainless steel sure \xe2\x80\x9e -,, s to the IECM rail. This\nbaseplate is 28 x .28 cm ( 11 x\n\n11\n\nin2 ) and it provides the framework for attachment\n\nof all the other sideplates and rigidizing structures. This baseplate is ground to\n\na finish of 60,u inch to insure minimization of the temperature gradient at the rail\ninterface.\n\nTwo \xe2\x80\x9d L " shaped aluminum bars are bolted along the length of the baseplate\nproviding a rigidixing support. Each leg of the " L " is 6 mm thick, and 32 mm wide, the\nrails are 23 cm long ( 11 in ),\nThe optical plate of the OEM separates the packar,^e into two volumes which\nare approximately equal. The top compartme nt housos all the optical elements, the\nsource and a portion of the sample wheel. The other compartment contains the\nelectronic subsystems, power supplies and the steppirc3 motor for driving the sample\nwheel. This optical plate is secured to the base rail\'s by means of six 3-32 stainless\n\nsteel screws. The optical plate is 6 mm thick: aIuminL,--n -\'0^ 1--T6.\nThe optical plate serves a further purpose in Jb^t\n\nit\n\nprovides structural rigidity\n\nfor the remainder of the packaue i n plane orth%onal to the baseplate. Additional\n" I_ " sections are attached to this plate to provide lateral ribbing.\nIn view of the weight restrictions, all the covering surfaces are aluminum plate\n6061--T6- 1.6 mm ( 0.0::2 in ) thick. All the plates are securely fastened together\nwith 6-32 and 3-32 stainless steel screws provided with lockcwasners.\n\nE\n\n_2^\n\nADVANCED KINETICS, INC.\n\nThe external surfaces of the plate\'s are treated to achieve thermal stability\nof the package. The selected finish for various surfrac:es is described in the section on\nThermal Analysis.\nAs previously indicated, the electronic and optical compartments are separated\nby the optical plate r but not herme\xe2\x96\xbaically. However ; careful control is being exerted\non the materials to be wed to minimize outgassinc effects. Outgassing from the stepping\nmotor and power supply inverter has already been examined at the AASK facilities by\nmeans of quadrupole mass spectrometer and found to be within completely accepts= 1 e limits.\nC\t\n\nLIGHT SOURCE AND MODULATOR\n\nThe illumination of t1he sample is provided by a low pressure, cold cathode mercury\nvapor discharge lamp. A double bore tubing of fused quartz contains 4-he active plasma\n6\n\nmedium and limits transmission of radiation to wavelengths longer than 1 1 00 A. The\n0\n0\n\nprincipal radiance of the Iiuht source is due to the hlg-r line at 2536.52 A. The bremsstrahluncg background and other lines contribute to only Q\'% of the total irradiance.\nThe lamp selected for this operation is the r \xe2\x80\xa2iamamatsu Prodel L937\xe2\x80\xa2001 with a\nlighted region of 25 mm length and a tube diameter of about 6 mm.\nThe experiments conducted during the Prelimi;iary Design Phase ( PDP ) have\nindicated that the lifetime of this source is severely re duced if operated under DC conditions.\nSince the breakdown voltage of this lamp ranges into the region of 1350 V for ambient\ntemperatures from 0\xc2\xb0C to 25\xc2\xb0C, we require an AC power supply Featuring a crest voltage\nto reliably ionize the lamp.\nThe AC power supply drives the lamp at 1.6- i:`r?z. This power supply has been\ntested with good results and is suitable for space en+: is onment.\n\n-3-\n\nf\n\nADVANCED KINE j\'ILS, INC.\n\nModulation of the beam will be provided by a Buiova tuning fork chopper. The\nfrequency of this device is around 200 Hz.. so that approximately 8 lamp current\nmodulation cycles will be contained in one cropper cycle envelope.\n\nThe tuning chopper provides a synchronous signal for lock-in amplification. An\nisolation transformer is used to decouple the +28 VDC ground from the signal ground as\nrecuired by the IECM guidelines.\nD\t\n\nSAiMPLE WHEEL WITH HOLDERS AND ROTARY DRIVE\nThe sample bolder subsystem features a carrousel con iuration with sin sample\n\n: positions. The wheel of the carrousel is an aluminum disc of 230 mm ( 9 inch ) diameter\n\ni\t\n\nand 3 mm thickness fastened to a spindle which is supported on three axial bearings.\nThe sample wheel is\t\n\ndriven at 90\' to the axial drive shaft by means of a worm\n\ndear assembly.\n\nA stepping motor is securely fastened by means of a 90 0 bracket to the underside\nOf the optical plate. This motar provides positive and accurate displacement of the\n\nwheel. The worm dear is adopted to generate a natural decent to prevent slippage of the\nsample wheel during the power-off cycle. The stepping motor features a stepping increment of 7.5\xc2\xb0 and it requires 0.5 sec to index to each su\',secuent sample position in\n100 drive steps. This includes the ratio of the woma gear which is 12.511.\nM\nA photodetector-LED combination will be ust- to jenerate location information\n\nand for interfacing the processing electronics.\nThe five samples will be installed on sample holders spaced 60\xc2\xb0 apart.

This air y, is pursued not only to safeguard\nthe integrity of the components, I ut, more immediately, to achieve the accuracy required\nfor the sample transmission, anti scattering measurementz. Effects induced by temperature\ndrifts in the electronic components are examined in another section of this review.\nThe\n\ntemperature stability of the package is predicated by the radiative and thermal\n\nenvironment which is analyzed in this section. The following parameters are of basic\nimportance in determining the time profile of the temperature of the OEM:\n\n}\t\n\nInternal Dissipation\n\nThe time cycle of the OENI is assumed to be characterized by a duty factor of\n0. 15, approximately. Some components must be energized continuously, whereas other\nsubsystems are operated only during the on-time of ihn cyr_le. This ,esults in an average\ninternal dissipation of 25 - 26 W. If this dissipation i. related to the OEM surface\navailable for radiative heat exchange ( A = 355 cm 2 , as defined by the radiative mask ),\nwe obtain a power density of 5.6 . 10" 2 W f cm2. Assuming, a ratio of solar absorptance\nto emissivity x/ e = 1, we can compute an equilibrium temperature of the package of\napproximately 75\xc2\xb0C.\nThis figure is obtained under complete decouplinj of the OEM from the thermal rail.\n2)\t\n\nThermal Power from Insolation\n\nrar the normalized altitude of several missions (_ ^ /R e = 220 km/6378 km\n,",035 1, the: percentage of sunlight per orbit remains rpproximately constant for a range\n41.\nI\'\n\nADVANCED KINETICS, INC.\n\nof orbital attitudes ( angle $ between ecliptic and spacecraft orbit ). Thus, a 60 %140%\n\napportionment between sunlight and darkness applies ?o a number of situations. This\nfactor is used to weigh the absorbed solar flux.\nThe thermal power due to insolation is computed to 47 W, if the previously indicated surface of 355 cm2 is exposed to the solar flux. The solar absorptance a determines\nthe fraction of this thermal power which is actually absorbed by the\n\nOEAA system.\n\nThe influx due to terrestrial emission ( 2 W ) and albedo ( 1 W ) represent\nrather minor components and these can be inc ^. rporated during the computations in the\ntime average of the insolation.\n\n3)\n\nPower Emitted by Reradiation\n\nThe power reradiatod by the OEM into outer space is readily competed under\nassumption of a surface emissivity e = 0.35 and a packo o e temperature of 300 "K. The\nradiated pov^,*er is about 14 W.\n4)\n\nHeat Exchan:p e under Blanket\n\nWe assume that under the blanket the different pack=ages will be in a state of\nquasi-e q uilibrium. The argument for this is simply that the ii:srmal rail will be short-\n\ncircuiting the pack=ages. the residual differences os h be due to She thermal conf ct\ndiscontinuity. For the OEM, we have specified are acceptable thermal contact conductance\nwhich will lead to a step transition of 1.46"C for a maximum flow of 65 W.\na\nIf a similar transition exists between adjac- n, p ccI<a;;es, the temperature di fference cannot exceed 3 1 - 5 1 C. Under these conditions and for e = 0.2, we expect\n\nthe radiative exchange to be less than 1 W / 1000 c..12 of interacting surface.\nThus, the dominant process under the blan?:ct will be Thermal e quilibration by\nconduction to the rail with a minor radiative exchanges,up:erimposed.\n-2 r\n\nf\nADVANCED KIi*,lE ICS, Iit\xe2\x80\xa2IC.\n\n5\t\n\nLeakage to Surrounclinp Spacecraft\n\nThe leakage by conduction and radiation to the spacecraft structure cannot be\nreadily computed because of unknown geometrical factors. However, we can simplify\nthe problem by assuming conductive decoupling and radiative exchange to a surrounding\n\nbianket of idealized spnericai structure.\nThe total OENI surface, excluding the fTontai surface which is in radiative\nexchange with space, amounts to 5130 cm 2 . This includes Hie bottoEn plate in contact\nwith the thermal rail. If tine surfaces are clean aluminum, the emissivity a = 0.04..\nThe emisswity of the surrounding blanket will be e b = 0.02. For the temperature of\nthe OEM we assume 32Cj\xc2\xb0 ; and for that of the blanket 250 1 .x. The radiative leakage\nwill he 7 W.\n\nB )\t\n\nTYPICAL TENIPERA URE\n\nI )\t\n\nCYCLES\n\nOEM Gecou,,1 -d from Thermal Rai l\n\nThese parameters provide t.he input for calculations winich are carried out under\nN\ndifferent approximations. The first model of interest 13 one in which tile OEI , is fully\n\ndecoupled from the thermal rail. V,-\'c have procgramm.ec tii3 descriptive ecuations of tinis\nsystem and we can input the following varia\'.fles: solar aLsorptance y , emissivity of\nOEM front surface\nsurface\n\ne,\n\ninitial temperature or 4UVt i s,, sunii\xe2\x80\xa2`i}tdarkness cycle which is\n\nslightly $-depandent. We can then follow the temperature riso of the package under\ndifferent assum ptions for these variaDles and for com.-!eta c+ecoupling from \'he thermal\nrail. Attached to this section of the review are print-outs\n\nfor\n\na fey; situations of intarest.\n\nWe have first exarnined tine case for which 3 /M = 1. This situation is met\ntypically for y = 0.9\n\n`nd i3\n\n= 0.\'3;5 which yields q/^, = 1.0d. In filis case, we should\n\nhave a blade anodized front surface with a coarse srand\'.)Iast flnisii.\n\n-3-\n\nADVANCED KlNE"i\'lC- S, INC.\n4\n\nThe second case covers onother extreme with x / s = 0,25/0.9 = 0,23. This\nfinish is achieved by application of a suitable paint ( etg, Cadillac write, or similar ).\nThe first case has been followed for 20 orbits, corresponding approximately to the\n34 hours of the OFT-1 mission. We notice that the temperature rise/orbit is about\n2.6\xc2\xb0C and that this increment tapers off to about 2\xc2\xb0C towards the end of the 20th orbit,\nThis case is characterized by ci/e = 0.91 t, g5 = 1.06 and the resultant end\ntemperature is 74\xc2\xb0C = 347\xc2\xb0Ki\nThe second case has been followed for\ncrease is only 1\xc2\xb0C/orbit, resulting in a final\n\no\n\nsimilar period and the temperature in-\n\ntemperature\n\nof 44\xc2\xb0C = 317\xc2\xb0K, Here,\n\nthe a/e = 0.25/0.90 = 0.20.\nThe second approach would be more suitable to the thermal environment of the\nOEM, since it would minimize temperature fluctuations. However, the serious drawback\nis that a painted surface would be required in the immediate proximity of the samples.\n\nlnspi f s of the tested durability of selected paints, here is\n\nno way of avoiding deterioration\n\nand flaking under the action of external UV radiation. Hence, these particles would\nimmediately deposit on the closest\n\ndielectric\n\nsurface under the action of the accumulated\n\ncharge. Thus, we foresee deposition on the exposed rampies.\nThe next step is to test the same configurations under coupling to the thermal rail\nto determine if the temperature excursion of tl:e first case can be suitably limited.\n2) OEM Cou led to Thermal hail\nThe previous computations\n\nhave indicated that the OEM could be maintained in\n\noperation only with cl/e s 0.3, if it were decoupled from the rail.\n\nThe next step is to introduce the mass of the added rail contributing to the thermal\ninertia of the system. Thus, to the OEM mass of approximctely 12,000 gm, we acid the\n\n-4-\n\n-\n\nADVANCED KINETICS ? \'N\'C.\n\nrail mass of 30,390 gm for a total mass of 42,390 gm. To minimize the complexity of the\ntreatment, we ignore the coupling to the other\n\npackages\n\nof the IECM.\n\nThe enact of this coupling results in a predictable decrease of the OEM temperature\nfor each orbit. The two cases for\t\n\n1.06 and 0,23 are indicated by print--outs\n\nwhich are enclosed.\n\nFor the case of x/e = 1.06, we notice that the temperature rises to 331 0K\n= 58\xc2\xb0C after the 20th orbit as op p osed to 351\xc2\xb0K = 78\xc2\xb0C for the some case but without\n1\n\ncoupling to the rail.\n\nFor the case of u/e = 0.28, the final temperature is about 315\xc2\xb0K = 42\xc2\xb0C, as\ncontrasted to 317\xc2\xb0K = 44"C for the decoupled case.\nWe have analyzed several other cases ccrresponding to the various surfaces and\nfinishes. A summary of all t ote results can be presented as follows:\n\na/E\nAluminum 6061-T6, :nndbinsted\n\nT20\n\n0. 60\n\ne = 0.41\n\n1.46\n\n332\xc2\xb0K\n\nx = 0.35\n\ne = 0.04\n\n8 75\n\n332\xc2\xb0K\n\n= 0.85\n\n1.08\n\n3310K\n\ncY\n\n=\n\nwith 120 grit size\n\nAluminum 6061-T6, polished\nand degreased\n\nAluminum 6061- T6, hard c:^:t\n\n- ? = 0.9.\n\nanodized, 25 pm thickness\nAluminum 6061-T6, gold-plated\n\na = 0.30\n\ne = 0.03\n\n14\n\n3310K\n\nce =\n\ne = 0.90\n\n0.28\n\n3150K\n\nover intermediate Pli layer\n\nPainted aluminum surface Cadillac\n\n0,25\n\nwhite\nAll of these calcu l ations are carried out with coupling to the rail, but without\nloading the thermal rail with other packages.

This Formulation takes into account a\ntemperature step due to the transition between the pa :!cage and the rail. The alternate\ndescription of the coupling yields temperatures which are higher by about 5\xc2\xb0K, as compared to the case where the coupling is described just by the additional mass of the rail.\nA\n\nprint-out of these alternate results for the specific case of. ac/ e = 0.9/0.85 is\n\nattached.\n\nWe have also treated the case of " cold orb*H-s " where the insolation term\ndrops to zero because of the attitude of the spacecraft with respect to the orbital plane.\nFor the sake of convenience, we have nade a = 0 to eliminate this contribution. The\nprint-outs indicate the fallowing temperatures at the end of the 20th orbit.\nT20\ne = 0.85\t\n\n309.6\xc2\xb0K\n\ne = 0.41\t\ne = 0.04\t\ns = 0.03\t\n\nAluminum\t\n\n316.5\xc2\xb0K\n322.80K\n323.0\xc2\xb0 K\n\nIn this case, the low thermal emissivity of the surface is the proper approach for\nmaintaining moderate temperatures of the package.\nC )\t\ni\n\n\t\n\nTHERMAL ENVIRONMENT CONTROLS FO;; OENI\n\nThese analytical results provide useful guidelines to be adopted in the construction\nof the OEM package and interfaces. These guidelines will be discussed now in more\ndetail.\n1)\t\n\nSpecifications for Thermal Rail Interface\n\nThe interface between the bottom plate of the OEM and the thermal rail provided\nin the iECM is of primary importance to the thermal stability of the instrument.\n\n-6\n\n3\n\nADVANCED KINETI ,S, INC.\n\nThe quality of the interface and the contact pressure applied determine the\nthermal gradient which is developed. This thermal step induces in turn a higher operating\ntemperature in the instrument.\nWe would like to maintain this gradient on the order of 7\xc2\xb0C. We can therefore\ncompute the thermal contact conductance he which is acceptable for this interface\nhe = G\'/A \xc2\xb0 AT\nWhere C is the thermal flow in W, A is the contact area in cm 2 and AT is the\ntemperature step in \xc2\xb0C. The contact area of the OEM bottom plate is 780 cm 2 and\ni\'\n\nQ --::s 45 W during the power cycle. Hence,\nhe = 5.7 \xe2\x80\xa2 109 W/ \xc2\xb0C \xe2\x80\xa2 crrt2\nWe have now to determine which contact pressure and surface finish is required\nto achieve this thermal conductance.\nPractical parameters are typically a surface finish of better than 60 11 inch and a\npressure of less than 2 atm ( 25 psi ). This pressure entails a total force of 1380 kg, or\nabout 230 kg for each\n\nof the six bolts which fasten the OEM to the thermal rail. This\n\nstress is acceptable since it corresponds to about 1/7 of the elastic limit for the 1/4-20\nstainless steel bolts foreseen for use.\nWe require therefore a finish of the contacting plates of better than 60 ;a inch to\nmaintain the desired thermal impedance.\nThese specifications are suggested for adoption and the OEM plate will be prepared to satisfy this finish with a flatness of 25 jim over the total extension of the plate in\nboth directions.\n2) Specifications for Surfaces Exposed through Blanket Opening\nThe choice of the surface finish of the OEM is dictated mainly by the requirement\nof minimizing spacecraft energy. We have seen Eho. a high emissivity leads to marginal\n-7-\n\n\t\n\nADVANCED Kl\\NE I aC5, ii\' C.\n\n1\n\nf\n\ntemperature increments during cold orbits. This in ttxn may necessitate heat input from\nthe thermal rail. This method of increasing the temperature of the package is clearly\ninefficient. Every package should be nearly thermally stable on its own account. Temperature excesses should be absorbed by the thermal rail and then disposed through the\nlarge spacecraft area into space.\nHence, we have selected the gold-plating for the frontal area of the OEM which\nis exposed to insolation. We deliberately avoid the use of paints in close proximity to\n\nthe samples because of the possibility of deterioration under the influence of UV radiation\nand subsequent deposition on the dielectric surfaces. The gold-plated surface maintains\nacceptable temperatures in the case of cold orbits. This finish also yields relatively\nsmall temperature excursions during hot orbits. The \'Following table summarizes the reasons\nfor this decision;\nEmissivity of Surface\t\n\nT ( Cold Orbit }\t\n\nT (Plot Orbit } \t\n\n4T\n\n0.85\t\n\n310\xc2\xb0K\t\n\n331\xc2\xb0\t\n\n210K\n\n0.41\t\n\n316"K\t\n\n-.2\n\n16\xc2\xb0 K\n\ne = 0.04\t\n\n3230 K\t\n\n0 K\t\n332\xc2\xb0K\t\n\n0.03\t\n\n3230 K\t\n\n3310K\t\n\n30K\n\nE\t\n\nWe obtain therefore not only a minimization of\n\nthe\n\n9 0K\n\nenergy input from the thermal\n\nrail, but also the best conditions in terms of- temperah.re stability of the package. The\ngold layer will be 0.00005 inch (= 1.3pm } thick and it will be applied on an intermediate nicicel layer an top of the aluminum surface, :;or the sake of avoiding scattering\ninside the chamber, the sample holders will be blacic anodized and the sample wheel will\nbe treated similarly.\n\nAll of the side surfaces will be polished and left uncoated in order to minimize\nthe emissivity of the areas under the blanket. We shall attempt to attain s \t\n\n0.05, or ^,\nPALGF\n\nADVANCED KINETlC\'5, INC,\n\nbetter. This finish will minimize the radiative interc;ction between adjacent packages,\n^i\n\nMoreover, this approach will minimize radiative Icckage to the blanket and through any\ngaps to the spacecraft structure,\n\nThese combined approaches should stabilize tine temperature of the pac kage. We\nare planning to embed into the OEM three temperature sensors to determine the temperature\nfluctuation encountered during the mission at several crucial locations. The first sensor\nshall monitor the temperature of the interface to the thermal rail. A second sensor wi ll\nbe -installed in close proximity to the stepping motor and the third close to the UV lamp.\n\nO"Iuiz AL PAGE r;.\n\n\t\n\nC Cn^\n\nLLJ I\t\nad\t\nM\t\n\ne^\n\n0\nU\n\n[3\n\n(D\n\nm\n\nU\nm^\n\nu\nE\n\nE\n\nu.i o\n\n0 0\n\ncs..\n0\nC\n0\n\nM\n\na.D\n\n0\n\nV\n\nO\n\nr-In\n\nC\nQ1\n\nQ`\n\nD\nO\n\nU\ncq\n\nCV\nfi\n\n.?\n\nm\n\nL\xc2\xb0\n^\n\no ca O\nrt\n\nLU\n\no\n\no Oi 0\no\n^.\n\nfi\t\n\n^U.Lj\n\n(VRKIM\n\nit\n\n^\t 11\n\no\n\ncn C\nE\n\nw\no\n\na)\nD\n\nr.+^+\nWr1Nr\xe2\x80\xa2r^ nn n.^rnnv nr nn +^nr^ 1ri r+ N\nnn[^e+rM r^nnr+nnn,\xe2\x80\xa2^\n\xe2\x80\x9esie-I r r^r rnnr nr-nnnnnr^ nnnnnnrr .nrnnnnl^r nrllnnnnr+r nnr rnrr s- NNNNN\n\nIN\n- \xe2\x80\xa2-1Nr.a\'lr[tnn +N rIC.N\xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2 1 \xe2\x80\xa2-1 .:T ^u1-cr NL\xe2\x80\xa21 nG -N4"Q\'.CVr\xe2\x80\xa2r+r %C L^ js JrirC{LGrrn-l.-If^NF.icC^.._^l1 p d W.:a n.K C. c..T CJ \xe2\x80\xa2 -+rf C1 Vf [.^\n\'NGi\n...

The longitudinal axis of the experimental tray is assumed to be\nparallel with the orbiter e:.is " X ". The outward normal is aligned radially with the\n" Z " axis of the vehicle. The plane defined by the experimental tray (" I.-M ") is\nparallel to the X -Y lane of the vehicle with an ofiiet in the Z-direction.\nP\nP\t\ni\n\nThe dynamic environment is predicated mainly by the forces developed during the\n\n!\t\n\nl_\n\nlaunch and return phases, ice which the related accelerations are indicated in the\nrespective coordinates.\n\nWe have now assumed that the orbiter " X " axis is aliened with the minor axis\nof the optical plate of the OEM. Thus, the X-axis can be assumed to intersect the\nsample wheel which is located in the X -Z plane. Rem this ^; c-)metry we can infer the\n. _\t\n\nmay_.::_.:\n\ndistribution of the forces and the stresses on the varia;,s con- pcnents.\nB )\t\n\nSTRESSES ON OEM STRUCTURE\n\nThe launch environment generates a maximum acceleroticn of -3.3 g along the\nX-axis. In the two transverse directions, the maxir.,ui-,1 Values of the acceleration are\nY = +-I.OgandZ = \xc2\xb1 1.53.\n\nWe are, therefore, mainly concerned with the stress effects in the X -Z plane which\ncomprises the optical plate of the OEM.\n\n-l-\n\nThe OEM structure is designed tribe anchored solidly to the thermal rail by means\nof six 1/4-20 stainless steel bolts. This attachment has two purposes: first, we achieve\nrigid coupling to the cage structure of the IECM and, second, we obtain a low thermal\nImpedance to the base rail\nThe stainless steel bolts allow a minimum permissible stress of 6,000 psi. The combined tensile stress level will be about 1,200 psi/inch-lb of tor q ue. This will result in\nan axial load in excess of 100 ibs/screw, or 600 lbs for the total package. With a projected\nweight of 25 lbs, this allows a large safety factor for dynamic stress.\n\nThe next members in the CEM structure are two " L " sections which run aloM the\nsides of the baseplate ( Y-axis ). The legs of the " L " are 1.25 " x 1.25 " with a web\nthickness of 0.25 ". Six 3-32 stainless steel dolts are used to fasten the " L " sections to\nthe baseplate. The holes in the baseplate are threa% ^Is^\', so that no countersinking is\nnecessary. The tensile stress level for these screws YA H be 3:\'C0 psi/ in \xe2\x80\xa2 lb of torcue. We\nhave examined the torsional deformation andshear s;-resses appearing at thesa " L " sections.\nThis effect is due to the acceleration of -3.3 g along the \t\n\nwhict, couples to the\n\nOEM frame. This effect is largely offset by the stiM ss of the optical plate. Thus, the\n" L " are stressed at the holding screws. The line b err,een C.e two legs of the " L " will\nnot be machined to a sharp 40 0 corner, but to a firil a radius of curve,\n\n\t to avoid stress\n\nrisers at that point.\nWe h;:ve analyzed the effect of the acceleration in the plane and transverse to\nthe optical plate. The loading is due to the attached motor. We find the stress level to\nbe only 20 psi with projected plate deflection of only 2 \xe2\x80\xa2 10~4 in.\nFurthermore, we have analyzed the elastic sta5ility of the optic a l plate m&oen\nsubjected to uniform smear around all edges. This shear cou!d arise from the moment\ngenerated during acceleration. The mass centroid has been assumed at the motor. This\n\n-2-\n\nsituations will shift only slightly as all the additional subsystems c~e located in the OEM.\nThe calculated limit for this instability is at 39,000 psi, which is for in excess of any\nanticipated stress level.\nWe have also studied the possibility of a twisting moment of the plate under transverse force In the Y-direction. In this situation, the plate is rigidixed by six 8-32\nstainless steel screws and in addition by an aluminum sheet of 0.0625 in thickness which\nis fastened at several points to the plate. The two lateral plates act as stiffening membranes\nproviding ample additional rigidity.\nThe last point comidered concerning the OEM v`ructure is the possibility of a\nbending moment under the action of the longitudinal acceleration: In order to avoid\nstressing only the basemount, it appears advantageous to provide a retaining bar at the\ntop of the IECM frame against which to anchor. This feature will offer solid containment\nof the OEM package after installation in the tray.\n\'these calculations indicate that the OEM st,ticture is basically sound when exposed to the projected acceleration environment.\nC )\t\n\nEFFECTS DUE TO VIBRATIONS\n\nThe stresses appearing in fh; OEM pcckege dire to ascent and reentry are relatively\nminor. However, the vibrational environment is both intense and troublesome. The\nvibrational spectral density plateaus at 0.07 9 2/ Hz from approximately 80 to 350 Hz.\nA spectral integration yields the counterpart effect of approximately 5 g with random\norientation.\nThe major subcomponents of interest in this connection are the optical plate, the\nsample wheel with sample holders and the radiation source,\n\n-3-\n\nORIGINAL PAGE IS\n0r PooR. O-uAZITY\n\nA\n\n_\t\ni\n\nf\n\n\t\n\n.S, INC.\nADVANCED KINET IORYT\'VAL PAG\n\nIS\n\nO\nLYff\nWe have first investigated the possible vibrations of the optical plate. The\n^TTr\'^\n\nassumption of free cantilevering is introduced ad hoc just to test the stability. For the\nfirst bending mode, we obtain a frequency of 75 Hz which is near the peak of the vibrational spectrum. The first torsional mode ( m = 2 ) is at 300 Hz, but the higher\norder modes occur at progressively higher frequency; and thus can be neglected. From\nthis knowledge, we have increased the lateral stiffness of the optical plate by anchoring at sequentially uneven intervals.\n\nThe next item analyzed is the sample wheel. Here, all the natural frequencies\n\nappear at rather high frequencies, thus, no resonant coupling will occur to the vibrational spectrum. The computations also indicate that the lower order modes for the\nsample holders appear at frequencies around 2 kHz which eiiminotes almost all of the\nlaunch environment vibrational spectrum.\n\nConcerning the radiation source, the colcuioions are rather complex due to the\nnature of the object. It appears for simpler to rigidiwe the source initially and to subject\nthe structure to the vibrational tests.\n\nThere are a number of individual components, such as set screws, which may be\naffected by the vibrations. Clearly, all the screws wil l be fastened with Locktite, or\nwith a similar bonding agent, during assembly of the unit.\n\nThus, also the effects of the vibrational environment can be counteracted by proper\nNatures of the structure.\n\nD)\n\nSTRESSES ON MISCELLANEOUS COMPONIE N i S\n\nAll of the components and subsystems of the OEM are exposed to the stress field\noutlined before. Calculations have been carried out to cover geometries and components\nWMch are amenable to treatment. Typical of this category is the stepping motor support\nmount and sample wheel drive system.\n-4-\n\nL._;, - .\n\nWe have attempted to provide a solid mounti.,g pad for the motor with shaft support\nby means of two roller bearings. The natural frequencies of these components are maintained in the fall-off region of the vibrational spectrum, or beyond. In this fashion, we\n(\t\ni\nE\t\n\n`-\t\n\nminimize resonant coupling effects.\nWe have applied this analytical procedure to all cases where it appeared fruitful\nand feasible.\nThe validity of the theoretical forecast shall be checked in a future series of vibrational tests.\n\n\t\n\nLil\n\nADVANCED KINE T ICS, INC.\nLAM NOT irk\n^pc\n\n\t\n\ng\n\nSUMMARY OF WEIGHT ANALYSIS FO;r OE,^1 FLIGHT SYSTEM\nf\n\n^j\n\n\t\n\nSUBSYSTEM OR COMPONENT\n\nOEM Enclosure\n\nREMARK\n\nWE IGHT\n\n3500 gm\n\nARC Lamp\nARC Lamp Power Supply\n\n\t\n\nIncluding leads\n\n20 cam\n\n775 Om\n\ngm\n\nARC Lamp Ballast Resistor\n\n30\n\nBulova Chopper\n\n38 Om\n\nTransmission Photomulfiplier\n\n51 gm\n\n\t\n\n\t\n\n\t51\nScattering Photomultiplier\ngm\nTransmission / Scattering Photomultiplier\nPower Supply\n\nPotted\n\n\t\n\n167 grn\n\nPotted\n\n\t\n\n\t200\nGm\nTransmission and Reflection Photomultipl i er Preamplifiers, Locke-in\n\nPotted\n\n( Estimate )\n\nAmplifiers and Scaling Amplifiers:\n\nIncludes PC8 board, PCB connector,\nand all components.\nController and Sevuencer Electronics:\nIncludes PCB board, PCB connector,\nand all components.\n\n200 gm\n\nStepper Motor ( Hurst T S )\n\n200\n\nEstimate )\n\n620 gm\n\nMultifunction PCB:\n\n\t\n\nIncludes Stepper Motor Logic, three\nTemperature Bridges and Amplifiers,\nand the Power-On switch.

The multipliers are\noperated at different voltages, and the signals are processed via the lock-in amplifiers\nto provide a 0 to +5 VDC full scale output. This signal is correlated with the sample\nwheel position. In addition, a data ready level is provided to allow the analog output\nof the lock-in amplifier to be strobed into the spacc:c \xe2\x80\xa2aft\'s processing network.\nPosition sensors will monitor the sample wnc: iro correlate the analog signal\nwith the sample position. The position sensors witi \xe2\x80\xa2_e interfaced with the sequencer\ncontroller subsystem to correctly index and keep track of the sample wheel position. See\nFigure I for the basic flight block diagram.\nThe UV Lamp Power Supply represents the major portion of the allocated input\npower to the system. ( See the Power Analysis section and the Power Profile Graph for\ndetails. ) The UV lamp and its power supply characteristics have been carefully studied.\n\n-I -\n\nADVANCED K1NE 1 7 1 _. i, I1\\1C.\n\nThe most reliable power supply, although inefficiew- consists of an AC power supply with\na series ballast resister. An AC power supply is used f o insure reasonable lamp lifetime.\nThis supply has a peak open circuit voltage sufficient to ionize the UV lamp\'over the\noperating temperature range of 0\xc2\xb0C to +i0\xc2\xb0C. The ballast resistor is gauged to limit the\nlamp current to\n\n0.005A.\n\nThe chopper will be a tuning fork type with an integral drive electronics. The\nchopper will not only modulate the lamp source, but will provide the reference signal for\nthe lock-in amplifier. Since the chopper output signal is referenced to the +23 VDC\npower ground, an isolation transformer is used to decouple the signal and power grounds.\nThe chopper frequency is 200 Hz with approximately 50% duty cycle.\nThe DC-DC converter will be of efficient desi g n to provide the necessary power\nto the lock-in amplifiers, tlia controller-sequencer circuitry, the motor logic drive\n\nelectronics, and the torrp . ,7:ture bridges for OENI,, c:i:_;,\xc2\xb0.:sric stidies. The power to these\ncircuit subsystems is controlled by the spacecraft\'s t\'owor Can command signal.

The electronics for this function\nwill be nearly all CMOS in design to conserve power.\nThe operation of the Sequencer-C ontroller electronics will now be discussed.\n( Refer to Drawing ^2. ) Two-position detectors ( opIcal Sensors ) are used to detect\nthe sample positions on the wheel. The open aperturS ( Io ) position is unique in that\nit has two small holes in tho sample wheel to correspond its position. All the other\npositions (Il -I5 ) have only one hole associated with their position. The circuit,\nas designed, will reset the sample wheel to the t o position if it should not be in that\nposition initially when the spacecraft\'s Power On command signal is given. Since the\nPower On command has a fixed time cycle, tentatively set at a minimum of 66 s on ( and\n429 seconds off ), the sample wheel must return to the I. position before the end of the\npower cycle to avoid a Reset command in the next power cycle. The output data will\n-10-\n\nJ\n\nADVANCED KI1 ,IE Y .^, INC.\n\nnot be valid in the Reset mode since the integration ( dwell ) time will be insufficient\nfor accurate signal processing. The signals from the transmission and reflection Riv1T\'s\nwill be valid and accurately correlated to the correct sample position when the sample\nwheel starts initially in the Io position. The Position data output is updated by a counter\nand its output is buffered to drive two TTL leads. However, since the GSE interface\n\nrequires a 1 unit load, the maximum loading allocated for the IECM will also be a 1 unit\nload when operating together.\n\nAn integrating time cycle will be initiated initially at the power-on cycle for a\nduration of 10 seconds. During this t =me the I o signal will be processed. At the end of\n\nthe 10-second integration time, a Data Ready command will be generated to signal the\n1ECM that the positional data and the transmission and reflection signal levels are valid_\nThe Data Ready pulse width will be at least I ms wide. The Data Ready is TTL compatible\nwith a 2 unit load capabi!\'Py. Like the position Icf- .^vels, 1 unit load is for the GSE\nand one for the IEC.M. The Dcfa steady pulse also iziii\xe2\x80\xa2 iates the command to step to the\nnext position (I 1 ), The stepper motor power, as vretl as the index clock, is thus enabled\nto move the sample wheel. When the next sample position is sensed by the optical sensors,\nthe stepper motor clock is stopped and the power is =c.-izoveu from the stepper motor itself\nto save power during the integration time. After the 60--second integration time, the\nData Ready pulse is generated again to allow 1-he val ic3 data to be transferred to be processed.\nAgain, a new index command is given to the stepper motcr to move to the next position.\nThis process is continued until the I o position is again reached. At this point the sample\nwheel will wait in the I. position even if the Power On command is st-6sta-tially longer\nthan the 66 seconds ( minimum ) allocated. The stepper motor will be off and the\nelectronics will await the new Power On command before starting a new integration/index\n,\ncycle over one complete revolution incorporating all six sampie positions.\nThe motor clock is set at about 100 Hz to al,nw the motor to index to the new\n\nADVANCED K11`!E\xe2\x82\xacI- I 1i\\1C.\n\nposition in 1 second.

The FC?TP shal I be submitted to MSFC by the end of\nJune, in line with the Time Schedule for the Program attached with this presentation.\nThe FOTP shall entail the following Test Program.\nA ) THERMAL ENVIRONMENT TESTS\nWe shall cycle the components of the CEr\'Yt and the structure over the required\nnon-operational temperature limits of -55\xc2\xb0C to +10 : 3 k::. All the components shall be\nsubjected to this cycle before incorporation into the related subsystems or PCB\'s. A\ndetermination will be made of the integrity of the component once the operational temperature limits are reestablished.\nThe second category includes thermal shocks between the required temperature\nextremes of -55\xc2\xb0C end +70\xc2\xb0C. We would suggest to exclude From such tests the samples\nof MgF2 , LIF and Caf"2 , since these crystalline lattices are susceptible to very abrupt\n( \xc2\xa2 1 sec ) thermal shocks. The temperature interval of 135\xc2\xb0C could be incremented in\nseveral gradual steps on the time scale of seconds. This would correspond to the maximum dT/dt which could be encountered during a mission. All the othar components\nshall undergo this specification.\nThe third category of tests shall cover thermal vacuum conditions. We shall test\nthe OEM and its components for operation under vacuum conditions and under temperature\nexcursion over the operati:sg range 0\xc2\xb0 - 70 0C. We c.n control the vacuum pressure b,\nmeans of diffrusicr; purnp and li quid nitrogen cooler \xc2\xb1;af :a. However, we cannot provide\na space chamber with LN interstitial cooling.

The guidelines shall be MIL STD4[\']A and 462.\nThese tests shall include detailed diagnostics in a screened room and with use\nof widebond CRO and sensors.\nC)\n\nHUMIDITY TEST\n\nA humidity cycling test will be included, in 1*ne with MIL STD 810 C. However,\nwe would like to exempt t1he optical samples from \t\n\nto extreme situations in\n\nmoisture and temperature other than those which occur in a natural environment. The\nfluoride salts are slightly h ygroscopic and some surface damage may resu lt from protracted\nexposure to high moi sture and high temperature condl"ions.\n\nAll other components shall be exposed to the siandard moisture cycle.\nD)\n\nCONTAMH ,!.ANT OUTGASSING\nl\n\nComponents and the OEM structure shall undergo vacuum testing over the operational temperature range. Change in pressure after blank-off of the diffusion pump\nshall be recorded at different intervals to infer the amount of cut;assing.\nFinal outgassing tests shall be conducted with a quadrupole mass spectrometer at\nthe MSFC facilities. The vacuum-tight feedthroughs for there tests shall be provided by\n\nADKIN.\n-2-\n\nf\'\n\nADVANCED KINETICS, INC.\n\nTests on the outgassing of three components c7 the OEM have been carried out\nin March at the MSFC facilities. TY}e first test was conducted on the stepping motor on\nMarch 22, 1977.\nInitial pressure was around 3 \xe2\x80\xa2 10\' Tort and this level was probably attributable\nto the outgassing due to manipulation of the object. The temperature of the stepping\nmotor was raised initially to 43\xc2\xb0C ( 110 \xc2\xb0F )\xe2\x80\xa2 The initial distribution of the effluents\ncomprised at least some ten peaks ranging from approximately 23 to 111 AMU. Overnight\npumpdown reduced the pressure level by more than an order of magnitude to 10 -7 Tarr.\nThe motor temperature was increased to 52\xc2\xb0C ( 125*F ) which accelerated the final\noutgassing. After a few hours, the final pressure was down to 10 -9 Tarr with very few\nmass peaks remaining between 97 and 125 AMU. Tf:: \'r;.kground pressure of the space\n\'-10\nTarr with\nchamber with the motor removed was only slightly lbetter at roughly 10\nresidual mass peaks at 97 to 119 AMU.\nThus, it appears that the stepping motor can be outgassed by conventional baking\n9\ntechniques and that the residual pressure is in the range of 10 Torr. This motor was\nlubricated with low vapor pressure Octoil S during f\'obrication. Hence, it appears that\nthe motor can be operated in the component comprjrtinent without additional encapsulation.\nThe inverter power supply has been sUbjected to the same outgassing tests. The\nresults appear to indicate Shat the some degree of pressure can be attained after an initial\nperiod of more copius outgassing.\nE ) VEC\xc2\xb0ATIO1\'-1AL TESTS\nThe vibrational tests must be carried out by a testing laboratory equipped for\nthese measurements.

We are particularly interested in\nfollowing the performance of the instrument under variation of the operating temperature\n.\nto investigate the passibility of drifts and to deter;.,irc ; f the Basic accuracy of each unit\nis unaffected.\nOther tests include cyclic application of power and its effect an data accuracy.\n\n4\n\n=40 SAM\nADVANCED KINET I\'_ 3, INC.\n\nSAFETY AlYALY51.\nWe have analyzed the OEM package from the viewpoint of safety and we have\ncovered the following aspects:\na ) Explosive Gases or\n\nFumes\n\nNo gases are stored in the OEM package and no fumes can be generated\nover the contemplated operational temperature range of 0\xc2\xb0C - 70\xc2\xb0C.\nb ) Overhe 4-ing of Components\ncurrent limiting sensor with automatic shut-off of the\ncircuitry to avoid any possible over-current mode.

This precaution has\nbeen incorporated to avoid the possibility of overheating in a nigh power\ncomponent.\ne } UV Lamp\nA low pressure lamp has been selected instead of a high pressure type for\ngenerating the UV radiation. Thus, any breakage of the lamp would\nresult in an implosion from sea level to an altixuda of approximately 200,000\nfeet, The construction of this lamp is .;xtremely solid with a double shell\ndesign of silica glass.\nThe lamp is completely contained in a surrounding aluminum housing.\nHence, even in the unlikely event of breakage, no debris is allowed\nto disperse.\nf ) HV Breakdown\nTwo HV lines are used on the OEM. The first line connects the small\npower supply package to the two photomultipliers. We shall carefully\ndimension the insulation to avoid ony cn-ona or breakdown effects by\n\n...

Luring operation, the lamp\nis running at 350 V crest. The remaining voltage is dropped across the\nballast resistance.\nWe shall insulate very carefully this line and avoid completely unpotted\ntransitions, sharp bends or other discontinuities which could induce local\ndefects.\ng ) Elimination of PVC\nAll wires used in the CEMt shall be c the Teflon coated type.

These activities resulted ln tine delivery of tnree space-wortny\nOptical Effects Modules to the i\'-lf-,.SA Nlarnai\' \') pees Flignt Zenter for incorporation in the lKN- 1 system of the Space S;-)uttlP.\nThe program lasted for a total period of 22 months. All activities have\nbeen on target tirnewise, exception made for t;ne delivery by the manufacturer of\nthe pnotomultipliers, an item which could ,not :,o o\'^toined on scnedule. The\nprogram entailed an initial Preliminary Cesign \'ease of 4 months, a Critical\nDesign Phase of 5 months and a remchi q9 period of 13 M. o,nt.,ns taker up by\nManufacturing, Testing and Delivery of tine three fligntworth y packages of the\nOENA.\n\nAll the initially set target figures fcr volurne and weight of t;ne package\nand for power consumption i-ave been fully satisYied. Performance has been\nsecured not only for the transmission mode as cr: l-- inally specified, but also in a\nsecond cnannel in the reflection mode.\nThe design of the Optical Effects Nilodui a requiree solution of a substantial =number of tecn,nological problerns. In t,ne forefront of our attention has\nbeen the source of radiation ( UV lanip ) wnos^ perfomiancn under laboratory\nconditions was known only in a superficial rna.;n-r. Considerable time lac\' to Lis\n,\ninvested in devising Cie appropriate operai \xe2\x80\xa2 in g ;: -lime for this lamp to avoid the\ncataphoretic effects induced by the application of a GC, electric field and resulting in reduced lifetimes. T;ne ;nig,n frequency operating Mode developer for\nthis operation nas been I ecteficial with msa,rct it , lifetims. It nos also re;ultec\n\nIn appreciable savings of power by appropriate\t\n\nof the inverter module and\n\nof the coupling transformer. Unfortunately, there was not sufficient time during\nthis project to study the problems which are brought about by the extreme parameters of space operation. For instance, the change in the radiant output of the\nsource with temperature etas been apparent and it ;gas been documented. The\ntechnique adopted in the measurements consists of taking ratios of the radiant\nabsorption or scattering versui an empty sample position. Thus, to first opproximation the effect of luminous radiance change is compensated. However,\nparticularly at low temperatures, where condensotion effects of trio lamp dopant\n( mercury ) take place, the luminous intensity decreases rapidly and ratios .of\nsmall numbers become statistically less significant. At the other end, in the\nhigh temperature regime, the brightness increases rapidly with temperature imposing\na demand for a wide dynamic range of the: system, a feature which is not amenable\nto the limited acceptance of the recorder system.\nInitially, the system was based out the assumption of temperature\nstabilization to be provided by the IECM thcrinal rail. From the viewpoint of\nefficiency, thermal stabilization should have been ttie task of each individual\npackage and it would have been a preferable ci-,:,ice also for the OEM. Thermal\nstabilization of the lamp at some intermediate tcni erature, e.g. x-30\xc2\xb0C, would\nhave entailed on!y a small power investment during cold orbits and a considerably\nreduced change in luminous intensity during the not orbit cases. In effect, since\nthis lamp may well be the only reasonable approach for the UV region for space\napplications, additional investigations should be devoted to develop temperature\nstabilized prototypes. With\n\nelevated constant te.perature, the problem of dopant\n-2-\n\nabsorption against the electrode surface (\n\nspongy molybdenum ) may well be\n\nrelieved, which would further improve the lifeti,ne. Other types of electrodes\n( e.g, tungsten ) should be studied to determine possible advantages in the glow\ndischarge regime of operation.\nSubstantial problems were encountered in the area of the detectors\n( photomultipl iers ). The fact that only one sim m l a ;;lanufacturer exists now in\nthe US for space-worthy photomultipliers with se-asitivity in this particular region\nof the UV teas been adversely felt during this program. The procurement cycle for\n\nthe six photomultipl iers required for the three OEM packages has lasted as long\n\nas the project itself , depriving us of the opportunity of examining these sensors\nmore\n\nthoroughly before installation into the packages.\nThe co-Aplete circuitry for the OEM has been designed following the\n\nmost advanced technology malting use of low power QMOS devices. Selected\ndevices of NAIL specifications were difficult to obtain and the delivery\nquired generally\nof\n\n10\'\n\nphotomultipliers\n\ncycle re-\n\nweeks or longer, In the planning for eventual refurbishment\n\nand electronic components these extended delivery times\n\nshould be taken into account.\nIn retrospect, the real difficulties encountered during the program may\nbe ascribed to the acquisition cycle. It beconiGz; prrgressively evident that\nindustry at large is avoiding the manufacturing and testing obligations for selected\nsmall quantity components. Small business companies, such as BHK ( UV lamps )\nand Hurst M3nufncturing ( stepping motors ), ;gave been a noticeable exception.\nThese outfits have reacted with promptness to the special demands of the application.\n\n-3-\n\nA considerable amount of the program we s taken up by paperwork. Some\nof these activities could possibly be reduced ir y :;.e future at no detriment to the\n\ncompleteness of the project ( e.g. ?. copies of the ,Monthly Technical Report instead\nof 15 copies ). This could result in substantial savings to the NASA operation and\nto tht contractor.\n\nFinally, the constant liaison with the NASA Technical Monitor, Mr. Roger\nLinton, has proven to be the most useful element of the project. In all these high\ntechnology programs requiring performance within a very restricted time and\nbudgetary frarnewor1k, the need for close liaison between the agency and the\ncontractor is of paramount importance in reaching optimal decisions rapidly.\n\nPeriodic contacts with o gler members of the NASA IEC.N1 team nave been very\nproductive. This cooperative approach has made it possible to complete this\np""rtnv in a highly condensed schedule and [% eXceeding a number of mie targets\n\nv\norigi ially defined. The Optical Effects Module will serve as a real time contamination monitor on board of the Space Shuttle acid should therefore become a\nuseful instrument in future space programs.\n\n-4-\n\n'
