b'U.S. Spacesuit Knowledge Capture\nCinda Chullen 1\nNASA, 2101 NASA Parkway, Houston, Texas, 77058, USA\nKen Thomas 2\nHamilton Sundstrand, Windsor Locks, CT 06096, USA\nJoe McMann 3\nOlde Irish Consulting, Temple, Texas, 76502, USA\nKristi Dolan 4 and Rose Bitterly 5\nEngineering and Science Contract Group, Jacobs Engineering Technology, Houston, Texas, 77058, USA\nand\nCathleen Lewis 6\nNational Air and Space Museum, Washington, DC 20560, USA\n\nThe ability to learn from both the mistakes and successes of the past is vital to assuring success in the future. Due to\nthe close physical interaction between spacesuit systems and human beings as users, spacesuit technology and usage\nlends itself rather uniquely to the benefits realized from the skillful organization of historical information; its\ndissemination; the collection and identification of artifacts; and the education of individuals and groups working in\nthe field. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), other organizations and individuals have been\nperforming United States (U.S.) spacesuit knowledge capture since the beginning of space exploration. Avenues used\nto capture the knowledge have included publication of reports; conference presentations; specialized seminars; and\nclasses usually given by veterans in the field. Recently, the effort has been more concentrated and formalized whereby\na new avenue of spacesuit knowledge capture has been added to the archives through which videotaping occurs,\nengaging both current and retired specialists in the field presenting technical scope specifically for education and\npreservation of knowledge. Now with video archiving, all these avenues of learning can be brought to life with the real\nexperts presenting their wealth of knowledge on screen for future learners to enjoy. U.S. spacesuit knowledge capture\ntopics have included lessons learned in spacesuit technology, experience from the Gemini, Apollo, Skylab and Shuttle\nprograms, hardware certification, design, development and other program components, spacesuit evolution and\nexperience, failure analysis and resolution, and aspects of program management. Concurrently, U.S. spacesuit\nknowledge capture activities have progressed to a level where NASA, the National Air and Space Museum (NASM),\nHamilton Sundstrand (HS) and the spacesuit community are now working together to provide a rather closed-looped\nspacesuit knowledge capture system which includes specific attention to spacesuit system artifacts as well. A NASM\nreport has recently been created that allows the cross reference of history to the artifacts and the artifacts to the\nhistory including spacesuit manufacturing details with current condition and location. NASA has examined spacesuits\nin the NASM collection for evidence of wear during their operational life. NASA\xe2\x80\x99s formal spacesuit knowledge\ncapture efforts now make use of both the NASM spacesuit preservation collection and report to enhance its efforts to\neducate NASA personnel and contribute to spacesuit history. Be it archiving of human knowledge or archiving of the\nactual spacesuit legacy hardware with its rich history, the joining together of spacesuit system artifact history with\nthat of development and use during past programs will provide a wealth of knowledge which will greatly enhance the\nchances for the success of future and more ambitious spacesuit system programs.\n1\n\nProject Engineer, Space Suit and Crew Survival Systems Branch, Crew and Thermal Systems Division, NASA Parkway,\nHouston, TX 77058/EC5.\n2\nProject Engineer, Hamilton Sundstrand Human Space Systems, One Hamilton Road, Windsor Locks, CT 06096-1010/ M/S\n1A-2-X65.\n3\nSole Proprietor, Olde Irish Consulting, 4858 Lakeaire Circle, Temple, Texas, 76502.\n4\nProject Engineer, EVA & Health Systems, 2224 Bay Area Blvd, Houston, TX 77058/JE2-B1N.\n5\nTech Dev Admin Specialist, EVA & Health Systems, 2224 Bay Area Blvd, Houston, TX 77058/JE2-B1N.\n6\nMuseum Curator, Smithsonian Institution, National Air and Space Museum, Space History Division, P.O. box 37012,\nWashington, DC 20013-7012/MRC 311.\n\n'
