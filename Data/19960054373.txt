LASERS\n\nEXECUTIVE\n\nSUMMARY\n\nA study was initiated in 1995 by NASA, co-sponsored\nby the U.S. Air Force\nCommand,\nto determine the feasibility of removing\nthe bulk of the threatening\norbital\norbit (LEO) by irradiating\nit with a ground-based\nlaser. The laser energy ablates a thin\ndebris particle, causing plasma blowoff. The dynamic reaction from one or more laser\ngee of the orbit and hastens reentry.\n\n(USAF) Space\ndebris in low-Earth\nsurface layer from a\nhits lowers the peri-\n\nThe study was undertaken\nas an initiative of the Advanced\nConcepts Office at NASA Headquarters\n(HQ), and managed by the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC). The study team included USAF\nPhillips Laboratory,\nMIT Lincoln Laboratories,\nNASA MSFC, Northeast\nScience and Technology,\nPhotonic\nAssociates,\nand the Sirius Group.\nA wide range of objects in orbit are characterized\nas orbital debris. The size range of greatest interest is 1 to 10 cm. While objects smaller than 1 cm are extremely\nnumerous\nand difficult to detect, shielding\nagainst them is straightforward,\nalthough somewhat\nexpensive.\nObjects larger than about 10 cm are routinely tracked, and their numbers are small enough that operational\nspacecraft\ncan maneuver\nto avoid them.\nThere remain about 150,000 objects between 1 and 10 cm in size. They are problematic\nto track, too\nnumerous\nto avoid, and shielding against them is very difficult or expensive.\nNASA believes that the debris population\nlikely to exist during\nStation (ISS) is high enough that limited protection\nmeasures\nare being\nThese will protect it against objects up to about 2 cm in diameter.\n\nthe life of the International\nSpace\nincorporated\ninto the ISS program.\n\nVarious strategies for irradiating\nthe debris objects were analyzed,\nincluding those that engage\nobjects in several passes over the laser, and those in which immediate\nreentry is caused by irradiation\nduring a single pass. The latter is operationally\nthe simplest: fire at any debris object the sensors show to be\napproaching\nin favorable circumstances,\nwithout regard to whether it has been previously\nirradiated\nor not.\nThe former requires a plan such as our "steady rain" approach to guarantee\nthat the risk to space assets\ndoes not temporarily\nincrease at any orbital altitude.\nThe statistical characteristics\nof the debris population\nare reasonably\nwell known. Five different\nrepresentative\ndebris objects were defined as reference\ntargets to deorbit. The orbital distribution\nof the\ndebris particles was addressed,\nand the velocity change needed was determined\nto be a few hundred\nmeters\nper second--sufficient\nto cause the perigee to drop to 200 km. Achieving\na 200-km perigee reduces a particle\'s expected lifetime in orbit to a few days.\nThe interaction\nof laser beams with these debris objects was characterized,\nand the range of\ncoupling coefficients\nof the resultin8 plasma blowoff determined\nfrom both experiment\nand theory. The\nrequired incident beam intensity ancl cluration at the objects was then determined\nin order to cause the\nvelocity change necessary\nfor reentry within a few orbits. It was determined\nthat the laser has to place\nmany very short pulses on the objects to avoid self-shielding\nof the generated\nplasma at the object. The\nintensity of the irradiation\nwas also determined.\nOnce the requirements\nat the debris objects were understood,\nthe required ground laser characteristics were then defined, considering,\nthe effects of the atmosphere\non the beam. Effects included in the calculations\nwere turbulence,\nabsorption,\nstimulated\nRaman scattering\n(SRS), stimulated thermal Rayleigh\n\nscattering\n(STRS), whole-beam\nthermal blooming,\nand nonlinear refractive\nwas developed\nthat enables selection of the optimum laser for this system.\n\nindex. A graphical\n\ntechnique\n\nA number of options for detection,\nacquisition,\ntracking, and handoff of debris targets to the laser\nwere investigated.\nThese included radar, passive optical, active optical using the laser itself, and combinations of these. In addition, a novel detection technique was analyzed that uses the many communications\nspacecraft\nthat are or will soon be in orbit as "free" illuminators\nto form a bistatic surveillance\nsystem.\nA spectrum of system concepts\nwas developed,\neach of which meets some or all the system goals.\nThese concepts\nspan a range of costs and technology\nchallenges.\nIn addition, a demonstration\nof the capability on actual debris could be mounted using mostly existing assets for about $20 million.\nThe nearest term operational\nsystem would consist of a Nd:glass laser operating at 1.06 mm with a\npulse width of 5 ns operating\nat a rate of 1 to 5 Hz. It would have 3.5-m diameter optics, operate with a\nsodium guide star, and produce 5-kJ pulses. This system would cost about $60 million, and would cause\nthe reentry of essentially\nall debris in the desired size range in 2 years of operation,\nup to an altitude of 800\nkm. This system would be sufficient to protect the ISS as well as all other satellites in LEO below 800 km,\nincluding the planned Iridium and Teledesic\nsystems.\nMore\nobjects up to\nother civilian\nan additional\n\nambitious technology\nsystems were defined that have the ability to remove all such debris\nan altitude of 1,500 km. This would extend protection\nto the Globalstar\nsystem as well as\nand defense assets. This more advanced system would require an additional\n$80 million and\nyear of operation.\n\nA cursory analysis indicated that a system of this type is not inherently\nan antisatellite\nweapon,\nbeing relatively\nvery weak. It would have to illuminate a typical spacecraft\ncontinuously\nfor years to\ndestroy its structure, and months to make major changes in its orbit, though unintentional\ndamage to some\nsensors and other subsystems\nwould be possible.\nDue to the inherently\nnational character of such a system, if serious interest\ncapability,\nit is likely that the Department\nof Defense (DOD) should be the preferred\noperate it for the benefit of all spacecraft,\nbe they commercial,\ncivil, or defense.\n\ndevelops to pursue\nagency to develop\n\nthe\nand\n\nThe study concluded\nthat the capability\nto remove essentially\nall dangerous orbital debris in the targeted size range is not only feasible in the near term, but its costs are modest relative to the likely costs to\nshield, repair, or replace high-value\nspacecraft that could otherwise\nbe lost due to debris impacts for debris\nparticles greater than about l cm in size. Due to the difficulty in detecting debris smaller than about 1 cm,\nand their great numbers,\nthe presence of an ORION system would not obviate the need to shield highvalue, large, long-lived\nspacecraft to resist impacts of debris particles that are about 1 cm in size and\nsmaller.\nThe study concluded\nthat a demonstration\nsystem should be undertaken\ncost, the ability to detect, track, illuminate,\nand perturb the orbit of an existing\n\nto demonstrate,\nat low\nparticle of debris.\n\nThe study also concluded\nthat the bistatic detection technique could form a needed\nthe current space surveillance\nsystems, particularly\nin the Southern\nHemisphere.\n\naugmentation\n\nto\n\nPROJECT\nIvan\n\nBekey,\n\nSenior\n\nJohn Rather,\nJonathan\n\nAdvanced\n\nConcepts\n\nTEAM\nNASA/HQ\n\nOffice\n\nNASA/HQ\n\nStudy Advisor\n\nW.

The study team included USAF Phillips Laboratory,\nMIT\nLincoln Laboratories,\nNASA MSFC, Northeast\nScience and Technology,\nPhotonic Associates,\nand the\nSirius Group.\nThe orbital debris population\nhas increased\nat a linear rate since the exploration\nof space began.\nMost of the mass of the debris in orbit is in the form of large objects:\ninactive payloads\nand rocket bodies.\nMost of the risk to space assets, however,\ncomes from smaller objects. The small objects are missionrelated debris, such as bolts that separate in the deployment\nof payloads and, most importantly,\nfragments\nresulting\nfrom degradation,\nexplosions,\nand collisions\nin space.\nIf enough large objects are placed in orbit, the growth in the debris population\nwill change from\nlinear to exponential.\nThis is a result of the collisions\nbetween large and small objects. The population\nmay\nalready have reached the threshold for exponential\ngrowth in certain altitude ranges. Some mitigation\nmeasures\nhave, therefore, been put into place and others are being discussed.\nOne mitigation\nmeasure already being used is spacecraft\nshielding. This technology\nreduces the\nrisk of catastrophic\ndamage, and the production\nof more fragments\nin orbit, in collisions\nwith debris up to\nabout 1 cm in diameter. For the ISS this protection\nwill be extended\nup to about 2 cm for critical areas.\nThere is no technology\npresently available at a reasonable\ncost to shield against debris greater than about\n2 cm and traveling at 10 km/s mean relative speed. This is because the shielding weight penalty is an\nexponentially\nincreasing function of the maximum\nsize of the debris.\nThe additional shielding required just to extend the ISS protection\nenvelope from 1-cm debris particles to 2 cm weighs about 10,000 lb. For a launch cost of $10,000 per lb, the cost simply to launch this\nshielding\nis on the order of $100 million. Development,\nfabrication,\nand integration\ncould double the cost.\n3\n\nAvoidancemaneuvers reanother\na\nmeasure\nalreadybeingusedto dealwith orbitaldebris.Theseare\neffectivefor avoidingobjectslargerthanabout10cmin diameter. bjectsthissizeor largercanbetracked\nO\nreliablyandtheirorbitspredictedwell enough allow thedebristo beavoided.This methodonly applies\nto\nto assets\nthataremaneuverable,\nandis relativelyexpensive thatit requires\nin\nadditionalpropellant.\nPresently the,drawing,board,,are otherconcepts\non\na few\nthatmayeventuallybeuseful.These\nincludea maneuverablecatchers mitt unattachedpayload thespace\nfor\nstation. evicessuchastheseare\nD\ninherentlyexpensive\nandmay notbe ableto respondquicklyenoughto preventcollisions.\nNeithershielding(dueto theweightpenalty)normaneuversbecause thedifficulty of tracking\n(\nof\nandgenerating\nreliableorbit elements) resufficientto mitigatedebrisin the2- to 10-cmregime.Approxia\nmately150,0001-to 10-cmdebrisparticles\narecurrentlyestimated beorbitingtheEarth.Themajority\nto\nof this debrisis foundfrom 200to 1,500km in altitude.The maximumof thedistributionasa Iunctionof\naltitudeis foundaround1,000km.

It\n\nPARTICLE\n\nOne set of constraints\non the design of both the laser and the sensor systems is the range of characteristics of the debris particles. The microwave\nreflectance\nsets the size and power needed if a radar\nfacility is to acquire and track objects. Similarly,\nthe optical reflectance\ndetermines\nthe size of an optical\ntracking system. The optical reflectance\nalso plays a role in the laser system design, since laser reflection\nfrom a target decreases the momentum\ntransfer. The ablation and ionization properties\nof the particle surfaces also set requirements\non the size, pulse duration, and power of the laser.\nThe roughly 150,000 particles in the size range from 1 to 10 cm, which are the object of this study,\ncan be classified into five distinct groups. Our approach was to examine each category in order to establish\nminimum\nrequirements\nfor the sensor and laser systems. The requirements\nfor the categories\ncan then be\ncompared\nand the requirements\nassembled\nfor a system that deals with all five categories.\n\n2.1\n\nDebris\n\nDistribution\n\nin the I- to 10-cm\n\nSize Regime\n\nA great deal of work has already been accomplished\nin characterizing\nthe debris cloud surrounding\nthe Earth. The Haystack\nradar system of MIT Lincoln Laboratories\nhas done pivotal work in this regard.\nThe work is described\nmore fully in appendix\nC and is illustrated below.\nA sample of the Haystack debris measurements\nis shown in figure 1. The top part of the figure\nshows the number of particles detected per hour in bins of 50-km altitude each. It shows that relatively few\nparticles are detected below 500 km, and that the number of detections\nper hour rises to a level of about\n0.1 per hour per 50-km altitude bin between 500 and 1,500 km. The flux of detectable\nobjects is defined\nas the ratio of the rate of passage of detectable\nobjects to the cross-sectional\narea through which they pass.\nThe flux must be calculated\nfrom the detection rate in each altitude bin, taking h _ geometry into account.\nThe derived flux is shown in the lower part of figure 1.

Orbital\n\ndebris\n\nparticle\n\ncharacteristics\n\nmatrix.\n\nMost of the estimated\n150,000 debris particles in the I- to 10-cm size range are in orbits at inclinations ranging from 30 to 99. This has implications\nfor the laser site selection.\nThe latitude requirements\nare somewhat\nrelaxed. The use of Haystack\nitself, in remote association\nwith a laser site at a clear weather,\nclear sky location (such as Albuquerque\nor China Lake) becomes\nan intriguing possibility.\nOnly the Na/K spheres (about 50,000 particles)\nare in nearly circular orbits. The remainder\nof the\ndebris particles\ntravel in elliptical orbits ranging from 1,500-km apogee to 520-km perigee. For example,\nthe bulk of the carbon phenolic fragments are in highly elliptical orbits with apogees around 1,190 km and\nperigees around 610 km. Since the inclination\nof these orbits is about 87 \xc2\xb0, they constitute\na risk to all\nspace-based\nassets in this range; and, since the main source of debris in orbits from 200 to 500 km is\nmaterial entering this range from above, they are a risk to practically\nall assets with orbits below about\n1,200 km.\nThe multispectral reflectivity\nof the debris particles has been investigated.\nThe requirements\npresented to the sensor and laser systems hold no major surprises.\nThe microwave\nreflectivity\nof about 0.1 is\nmanageable\nto more than a 2,000-km slant range by current, proven radar technology\nsuch as Haystack.\nReflection\nat 1.06 microns to more than a 2,000-km slant range is expected to be sufficient to enable fine\ntracking using a laser radar. Reflection\nin visible light is expected to be more than sufficient to allow sunlight tracking at appropriate\ntimes during the day to more than a 2,000-km slant range. A 2,000-km range\nin these categories\nis the maximum\nneeded to track debris at 45 \xc2\xb0 in elevation and 1,500 km in altitude.\nA final conclusion\nfrom figure 3 bears on the laser system requirements.\ncumulative\nDv required to deorbit particles from the five categories\non a single\nrange from 90 to190 m/s.

The product TA/m (lifetime Umes cross-sectional-area-to-mass\nratio) is graphed in\nfigure 4. As an example of the use of the figure, first find the 200-km perigee altitude on the horizontal\naxis. Read up to the curves and find that TA/m a 1 cm 2 da_/t\nNext, as a worst case, look up the lowest\nA/m in figure 4, which is 0.15 cm 2/g for a steel part. 1\n13 divide this into TA/m and find that the\nexpected life in orbit is about 7 days. In other words, a typical debris particle will reenter in a few days due\nto atmospheric\ndrag as it approaches\na perigee less than 200 km.

Only after many years of both current\nand new mitigation\nmeasures\ncould the population\nbegin to fall.\nHigh laser intensity on the surface of the particle is a key requirement\nfor generating\nsufficient\nDv\nfor deorbit. Two basic operational\nstrategies\nare available. The first is called one pass, one deorbit, and the\nsecond is called steady rain. In the former strategy, the particle is detected soon after it rises above the\nhorizon and a sufficient\nnumber of high energy laser pulses are brought to bear on the surface of the particle. Each pulse ablates a thin layer of the su_ace\nand subsequently\nl_onizes it. The reaction causes a s_mall\nchange in me particle\ns orbit. Sufficient\npulses on one pass bring the perigee below 200 km, which is our\naetlnltion\nof a successful\ndeorbit.\nThe second strategy is to engage lower altitude particles before higher altitude ones. The idea is to\nwalk down, from high to low, a train of particles\nwhile actually reducing the risk to space-based\nassets.\nFor example,\n100-km.bands\ncould be established.\nFirst, only particles in the 200- to 300-km range would\nbe allowable\ntargets. A particle would be lowered from the 200- to 300-kin band to below 200 kin. Only\nwhen a par_tlcle is removed from this range would it be permissible\nto engage a particle in the 300- to 400mn tgand. AS a particle from the 300- to 400-km band falls into the lower band, the risk to assets in the\nlower band is no higher than it had been at first, for one particle was removed at the beginning.\nThen, particles\nin both the 200- to 300-km and the 300- to 400-km bands would be eligible to be\nengaged.\nHowever,\nthe prerequisite\nfor engagement\nin the 400- to 500-kin would be a particle lowered\nfrom the 300- to 400-kin bands and the 200- to 300-km bands. This same scheme would be followed\nin\nmoving to higher altitudes. This steady-rain\nstrategy eliminates the possibility of a temporary\nincrease in\nrisk to space assets caused by failure to deorbit a particle in a single pass. Post-engagement\ntracking is\ndesirable\nin this case, to verify that the particles\nhave indeed been moved to lower orbits.\nAs will be discussed\nlater, the Dv\'s required are such that the one-pass, one-deorbit\nstrategy\nshould be workable\nfor the majority of the debris we have categorized.\nThis means that substantive\ntechnical margin is offered by having the steady-rain\noption as a backup operational\napproach.\nMore details on\nthe strategies\nare supplied in appendix C.\n\n3.\n\nTHE\n\nPARTICLE/LASER\n\nINTERACTION\n\nThe previous section dealt mainly with the debris characteristics\nthat set limits on their detection,\nidentification,\nand tracking. This section deals with the characteristics\nof materials thought to be present in\nthe debris when they are exposed to high intensity\nlight. The pulse energy, mirror size, and repetition\nrate\nrequirements\nfor an ORION laser stem from the surface characteristics\nof the debris particles being irradiated and the momentum\ntransfer needed for perigee reduction.\nThe requirements\non pointing are related to\nthe appropriate\ntimes for engagement\nof debris in elliptical orbits.\n\nNational\nResearch\nNational\nAcademy\n\n10\n\nCouncil Committee\nof Sciences,\n1995.\n\non Space\n\nDebris,\n\nOrbital\n\ndebris:\n\na technical\n\nassessment,\n\n3.1\n\nThe Particle\'s\n\nSurface\n\nAblation of a microthin\nlayer of the particle\'s\nsurface is crucial to providing\na significant\nchange in\nmomentum\nto the particle. Ionization and plasma formation\nfurther enhance the momentum\ntransfer. We\nignore the much weaker radiation pressure that exists in the absence of ablation. A substantial\namount of\nwork has been published\nby the fusion community\nover the past decade, pertaining\nto these interactions\nfor\nvarious materials.\nA wealth of detail can be found in appendix D.\nThe coupling coefficient\nCm is the ratio of the momentum\ntransferred\nto the energy delivered.\nThe\nlaser intensity on the target is the ratio of the power in the beam to its cross-sectional\narea, and the coupling\ncoefficient\nis a nonlinear function of intensity for a particular\nmaterial. The peak of the function corresponds to the laser intensity at which the maximum change in the particle\'s\nmomentum\noccurs for the least\namount of energy input.\nFigure 5 illustrates the coupling coefficient\nfor a single material, nylon, irradiated\nby varying intensities of KrF laser radiation.\nIn this experiment,\nthe pulse duration was fixed at 22 ns. At an intensity of\n2.5\xc3\x97108 W/cm 2, the laser energy is most efficiently\ncoupled to the momentum\nchange of the particle.\nReducin,,= the intensit\nby as, much. as 50 percent, only reduces, the. coupling coefficient\nfrom a maximum\nof\n6.5 to about 6 dyne JJ. Even if the vaporized\nmatermal msnot iomzed, there is good momentum\ncoupling by\nsimple evaporation.\nThis illustrates that there is a relatively forgiving\nthreshold intensity requirement\nfor\nthe laser at the particle, since large (50 percent) variations\nin intensity mean only a small change in coupling efficiency.\nWhat OptimumCouplingIntensityMeans\nIE+I\nExperimental\n\'\n_- - _Cmax=6.5\n\n4\n\nt ......\n\n_\n_\n,:_:_:_:::::: II\n............\n....\n_:.......

To put it precisely, the intensity on the target is the fluence divided by\nthe pulse duration, where the fluence is the ratio of the energy reaching the target to its cross-sectional\narea.\n11\n\nFigure5 illustrates\nthecouplingcoefficientfor a singlematerialanda singlepulseduration.The\nintensityneeded peakcouplingefficiencyactuallydepends n boththepulsedurationandthematerial.\nfor\no\nAs the pulse duration decreases, there is less time for energy reaching the target surface to be conducted to\nthe interior, and the intensity for peak efficiency\ndecreases.\nAlso, metals require a somewhat\nsity for maximum\ncoupling than nonmetals\nbecause they are better thermal conductors.\n\nhigher\n\ninten-\n\nRemarkably,\nwe found that a simple relationship\npredicts the fluence required for most efficient\ncoupling for all pulse durations\nand all materials for which there are sufficient data. The relationship\nis\nshown in figure 6. To use this graph, one chooses a pulse duration on the basis of available technology\nor\natmospheric\nfactors, and then reads the most efficient fluence within a factor of 3 or so. For example, for\npulse durations\non the order of 5 to 10 ns, an incident fluence of about 4 to 6 J/cm 2 provides the optimum\nmomentum\ncoupling for the five categories\nof debris. Recall that the coupling coefficient\ndepends only\nweakly on the intensity in the vicinity of the peak, so the fluence requirements\nare quite forgiving.\nShort Pulses Give Optimum Coupling at Lowest Energy\nLaser parameters for optimum momentum coupling\n(48 experiments, UV-IR, all materials)\nIE+4\nBest power-law fit to all data:\n\n_xa\n\n4) : 2.30E4 * x\'(0.446), R\'2 = 0.73,\n1E+4\n\n_xu\n\nrms fit error = factor of 3.2 (Ioglo = 5:0.51 )\n\n._\nT\n\nA\n\nW\n\n5\n\n>S\n\n_\n\n_6c\n\n_ 1E+4 i\ng\n\n1E+4\n"0\n.m\n\ng\n_\n.,_ _\n\nSymbol\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n_"/_\n\nWavelength Flange\nUV (100-499 nm)\n\nIE+4\n....... _\n_iii_\n..:,,_ _i_\n\n.v\n\n_7\n111\n_\n1E+4\n1E-13 1E-12\n\n_\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n1_\n\n,,,,,\n\no\ni\n\n1E-11\n\nVIS (500-1,059 nm)\nShort ,R (1.06-4.2 pro)\n\nI\n\n1E-10\n\niiii\n\n"]\n\ni\n\n1E-9\n\ni\n\niiili\n\ni\n\ni\n\niiiiii\n\n1E-8\n\ni\n\ni\n\n1E-7\n\niiinll\n\nLong IR (10.6 I_n)\ni\n\n1E-6\n\ni\n\niiiiill\n\ni\n\n1E-5\n\ni\n\nIIIIM]\n\ni i\n\niiillll\n\n1E-4\n\n1E-3\n\nat various\n\npulse\n\nI I\n\nIllll\n\n1E-2\n\nPulse Duration (s)\n\nFigure\n\n6.

We will consider issues of laser propagation\nin the next section, but we note here\nthat a fluence of 4.6 J/cm 2 provided by a laser at 1 mm launched\nby a 4.5 m adaptive optic would require\nan energy of at least 3,600 J per pulse at 0 \xc2\xb0 zenith angle, or at least 12,000 J per pulse at 60 \xc2\xb0 zenith angle.\nIf such energies are not available, or not available\nat such a high pulse rate, then it may be necessary to\ndeorbit the steel parts in multiple passes. The other target types will be much easier to deorbit in a single\npass.\n4.\n\nLASER\n\nATMOSPHERIC\n\nPROPAGATION\n\nThis section deals with a third set of physical constraints\non the ORION\nlaser and sensor systems.\nFirst, the relationship\nbetween diffraction-limited\nmirror size and spot size on the particle will be discussed. Next, we consider the intensity and beam quality losses associated\nwith operating through the\natmosphere.\nThese losses can be severe unless properly handled in the design of the laser system. The\nphysical mechanisms\nconsidered\nare atmospheric\nabsorption,\nturbulence,\nand nonlinear\neffects.\n\n4.1 Linear\n\nPropagation\n\nAs we showed in the previous section, a sufficiently\nhigh laser beam intensity on the particle surface is needed to impart the desired momentum\nchange. For a given amount of energy in a pulse of a given\nduration, the intensity is inversely proportional\nto the cross-sectional\narea of the beam at range. We now\nconsider the lower limit on the beam diameter\nin the regime of linear propagation.\nThe spot size is fundamentally\nlimited by diffraction.\nThe diffraction-limited\ndiameter of the spot is\nproportional\nto the wavelength\nand inversely\nproportional\nto the diameter\nof the telescope used to focus it.\nThe smallest spot size is obtained, in principle,\nby using the shortest wavelength\nand the largest mirror\ndiameter available.\nThe largest mirrors in existence\nare 10 m in diameter, but for a moment let us consider a much less\nexpensive\n3.5-m mirror as an illustration.\nAlso, let us take 0.5 mm, which is in the visible part of the spectrum, as a typical "short" wavelength.\nAt the longest slant range of interest, 2,000 km, the spot diameter is\nabout 70 cm. Recall that a fluence of about 5 J/cm 2 is required for most efficient\ncoupling with a 10-ns\npulse. With these numbers,\nwe arrive at a pulse energy of 20 kJ. Pulse energies\nconsiderably\nhigher than\nthis have been obtained with existing lasers. Thus, a simple calculation\nshows that existing technology,\nin\nprinciple, can easily provide the intensity needed for momentum\ntransfer to the most distant pieces of\ndebris under consideration.\nWhile smaller spot sizes further relax the laser power requirement,\nthe fine tracking challenge\ngrows, as does the size of the mirror. For primary mirrors larger than about 3.5 m, aperture size becomes\na primary driver to the cost of the laser system. Designing\nto shorter wavelengths\nreduces the aperture size\nrequirement\nproportionally,\nbut raises serious issues relating both to turbulence\nand the surface accuracy of\nthe mirror.\n\n4.2\n\nTurbulence\n\nand Atmospheric\n\nAbsorption\n\nThe air through which the laser beam passes before leaving the atmosphere\nis not a uniform\nmedium. The index of refraction is a function of the air density. The lower layer of the atmosphere,\ntroposphere,\nis characterized\nby turbulent\nmotion of cells of air with varying density.

The light travel time is such that the laser must be pointed up to 100 m ahead of the particle.\nAn artificial beacon, or guide star, must be used instead. A guide star is made with a laser much lower in\npower than the "pusher"\nlaser. The beacon will be aimed ahead of the particle and used to sample the\ncolumn of air through which the pusher laser must pass.\nThe guide star is not effective unless some of its energy is scattered back to the ground to return the\nphase information\nnecessary to distort the correcting\noptics. The beacon laser\'s wavelength\ncan be chosen\nso that some of its energy is scattered back to the telescope from a distinct layer high in the atmosphere.\nAstronomical\nsystems in use today typically make use of the presence of sodium in a layer about 90 km\nabove the ground. It is fortuitous that sodium can be found in this layer, for it is not difficult to build a\nlaser that can excite the sodium atoms into resonance fluorescence\nand return a usable signal to the ground.\nAt the position of the intended laser spot in the sky, the area over which the beam can be corrected\nby a guide star is known as the "coverage\nsize." The coverage size decreases\nas wavelength\ndecreases.\nIf\ndiffraction\nalone were considered,\none would use the shortest wavelength\navailable.\nBut once the coverage\nsize is smaller than the intended beam spot size, it is no longer possible to use the guide star to correct\ncompletely\nfor atmospheric\nturbulence,\nand the beam would spread and fall in intensity. One way around\nthis would be to use more than one guide star. Several closely spaced guide stars could provide the phase\ninformation\nneeded to correct the optics. While this is possible in principle, it has not been demonstrated.\nWe have found that for adaptive primary mirrors 3.5 m in diameter and smaller, a single sodium\nguide star is sufficient to provide the necessary\ncorrections\nfor a wavelength\nof 1.06 mm. If a shorter\nwavelength\nwere used, then a minimum of four closely spaced guide stars would be needed to provide\nsufficient\ninformation\nto make the necessary\nwavefront\ncorrections\nfor a mirror this size.\nA full analysis of the tradeoffs in laser wavelength\nmust take atmospheric\ntransmission\ninto\naccount. The atmosphere\nis highly absorptive\nfor most wavelengths\nof the electromagnetic\nspectrum.\nFortunately,\ntransparent\nand partially transparent\nwindows exist in which the laser beam will propagate\nwithout serious attenuation.\nThe visible and near infrared from 0.4 to 1.3 mm is one window, as is the\ninfrared band from 9.5 to 12 mm.\nAlthough the technology\nexists for powerful\nsmall spot on a target is prohibitively\nlarge. There is\nvisible to near infrared, and it is within this window\nFurther discussion\nof existing laser technology\nmay\n\nlasers at 10 ram, the mirror size required to produce a\nwell-developed\ntechnology\nfor powerful\nlasers in the\nthat the most reasonable\noptions are to be found.\nbe found in section 6.\n\n15\n\n4.3\n\nAtmospheric\n\nNonlinear\n\nEffects\n\nEven though the laser wavelength\nis chosen in a window of atmospheric\ntransparency,\none must\nconsider the possibility\nof beam spreading\nand energy loss by nonlinear mechanisms.\nThese are mechanisms that grow in importance\nas the intensity of the beam in the atmosphere\nincreases, or as the path\nlength in the atmosphere\nincreases. We have made an extensive\nstudy of these effects, including nonlinear\nrefractive\nindex, STRS, SRS, and whole-beam\nthermal blooming.\nNonlinear\nrefractive\nindex tends to degrade beam quality by spreading the beam, since the refractive index tends to increase at high intensity. STRS attenuates\nthe beam by breaking it up and scattering\nit\nin different directions.\nSRS attenuates the beam by scattering it in different directions\nat different wavelengths. Whole-beam\nthermal blooming spreads the beam as it heats the air through which it passes. The\nnonlinear mechanisms\nare depicted in figure 8. Our modeling\nof these effects is treated completely\nin\nappendix D. The limits imposed by the nonlinear mechanisms\non the ORION laser are graphed in figure 9.\nThe beam is assumed to be propagating\nvertically through the atmosphere,\nso that the near-field\nintensity\non the vertical axis refers to the beam as it leaves the laser. The beam is also assumed to originate at sea\nlevel. The graph would appear somewhat\naltered at angles other than vertical, and if the laser were located\nat a high altitude above sea level. The laser pulse duration is shown on the horizontal\naxis. The graph is for\na specific wavelength,\n1.06 mm, but it has the same basic shape for other wavelengths.\nNonlinear Processes in the Atmosphere\nr\n\nNonlinear Refractive Index(n2)\n_\nNonlinear I\nMedium J\n\nStimulatedThermal Rayleigh\nScattering(STRS)\n\n_j\n\n. \'\\\nLaser _\nBeam _\n\nBeam\nLaser\n\n_\n\n)-\n\nr\n\nStimulated Raman Scattering (SRS)\n\n.j-...._\n\n:73\n\nI\n_._=\nI /\n\nWhole-Beam Thermal BloomingThermal\nIndex\nGradient\n\n!\n\nLaser\nBeam\n\n<\n\nLaser\nBeam\n\no_\n\n.No_,\n\n\xc2\xa21)\nC\'J\n\nJ_\n\n=_..\n\xc2\xa2.,t)\n\nFigure\n16\n\nv_\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 /ll J\n\n_\n\ni\nI\n\n8.

Since it takes time for the air density to change in\nresponse to heating, this effect can be eliminated\nby using short pulses. The allowed intensity for wholebeam thermal blooming rises to extremely high levels for pulses shorter than 1 ms, where other limiting\nmechanisms\ncome into play.\nThe limit imposed by STRS is shown with a heavy solid line. It, too, can be avoided\na short pulse duration. If the duration is kept below 10 ns, then both STRS and whole-beam\nblooming are displaced by another intensity-limiting\nmechanism.\nNonlinear\n\nrefractive\n\n100 ns, it imposes an intensity\nslightly with shorter pulses.\n\nindex\n\nis not so well understood\n\nlimit of about\n\nfor long pulses,\n\nbut for pulses\n\n5\xc3\x97107 W/cm 2.

This limit is shown\nthe limits imposed by the four nonlinear\nmechanisms\n"comer\nof opportunity"\nstands out. The comer, for this\na duration of 10 ms. Pulses shorter than this or lower\nthe nonlinear\nmechanisms.\n\nOne possible exception to this "comer of opportunity" view will be considered\nlater for the attainment of subobjective\nB. When the SRS intensity limit first begins to rise for short pulses, it rises so\nslowly that the higher allowed intensity is too little to compensate\nfor the decrease in fluence due to the\nshorter pulse. But, recall that the intensity needed for most efficient momentum\ncoupling\ndecreases\nwith\ndecreasing\npulse length. There is a possible operating\npoint near 100 ps pulse duration where the SRS\nlimit has risen enough to make such operation attractive,\nand where the nonlinear index effect is not yet the\nlimiting consideration.\nIt is important to note how the situation of figure 9 changes when a different wavelength\nis used.\nAs the wavelength\ndecreases,\nthe near-field intensity\nlimits also decrease for a given pulse length. This\nimplies that the smaller apertures permitted by diffraction\nfor smaller wavelengths\ncan only be realized up\nto a point. Beyond that point, smaller apertures are forbidden\nby near-field\nintensities\nbeyond those\nallowed by nonlinear atmospheric\neffects.\n\n5.\n\nLASER\n\nAND\n\nSENSOR\n\nSYSTEM\n\nREQUIREMENTS\n\nThe particle characteristics,\nthe laser/particle\ninteraction, and the atmospheric\npropagation\nform a\nset of physical design constraints\nfor ORION. In this section, the requirements\nare folded together into a\ncomplete set of requirements\nfor the laser and sensor systems. Also included are the programmatic\nconsiderations of cost and schedule. The requirements\non the laser system will be compared\nwith existing technology in section 6. In section 7, the sensor requirements\nwill be related to existing technology.\nThe requirements\nfor the laser are summarized\nin the top row of figure 10. The laser system must\noperate in one of the atmospheric\ntransmission\nwindows,\nsuch as the one shown by the dark band from\n0.4 to 1.3 mm. Beam effects due to turbulence\nmust be minimized\nby active correction\nin which the area of\ncoverage is as large as the laser spot at range.\nIn order to place the critical intensity on the particle\nby operating in the region of opportunity\ndefined by short\nbelow the critical near field intensity (e.g., 3 MW/cm 2 for\ncapable of achieving the critical intensity and fluence (e.g.,\ndebris particle at least at 800 km altitude and preferably\nto\n\nat range, nonlinear effects must be minimized\npulse duration (e.g., 10 ms for 1 mm) and\n1 mm). The laser and corrective\noptics must be\n600 to 850 MW/cm 2, 4 to 6 J/cm 2) on the\n1,500 km.\n\nIf we take the number of debris particles to be 150,000,\nappropriate\nfor subobjective\nB, then the\ntime required to remove all the debris is about 0.3 year/min\ntimes the time for each piece of debris. The\ntime for each piece is an average, which must include off-duty time. For example, if the average operating\ntime to remove one piece of debris is 10 rain, then the time to remove all the debris is 3 years. The time to\nacquire suitable targets, and the repetition rate and maintainability\nof the laser, are all constrained\nby this\ntogether with the progammatic\nrequirement\nthat all debris to be cleared in some definite time, such as 5\nyears.\nThe Haystack radar has shown that in a field-of-view\nof 0.05 \xc2\xb0, the rate of detection of debris particles is about 6/h. Of these, only about 1/h is in circumstances\nsuitable for targeting.\nThe rate must be an\norder of magnitude higher, or the laser will be idle most of the time as it waits for a new target to be identified. Therefore, we recognize that the field of regard for the ORION sensor should measure\non the order\nof 0.50. If a sensor has a very high sensitivity\nand can be moved rapidly, then the field of regard can be\n18\n\nORION System Requirements\n\nLaser\n\nAtmospheric\n\nIntensity\n\nFluence\n\n(SRS,STRS, n2)\n\nWindows\n\nDebris\n\nDebris AIt.\n\nt-20-cm\nClear Time\n\nDebris\n\nNonlinear Effects\n\n(km)\n\n(yrs)\n\n(MW/cm 2)\n\n(J/cm 2)\n\n500-1500\n\n<5\n\nz_>5--10ns:\n\nI\n\nz>lOns:\n\nlill\n\n600-850\n\n[atm>_3MW/cm\n2\n\nI\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\nOperability\n\nS/N Ratio\n\nHandover\n\nImmediate\n\n24\nhours\n\nLimited by\nNoise\n\nds = 200 m\n\nSpin Orbit\n\nDiscrimination\n\nAssessment\n\nOperability\n\nS/N Ratio\n\nHandover\n\nX-section\nOrbil\n\nImmediale\n\n24\nhours\n\nLimited by\nPhoton\nCount\n\nds = 200 m\n\nOperability\n\nSignal-toNoise Ratio\n\nHandover\n\nLimiled by\nPhoton\nCount\n\nds = 200 m\n\nField of View\n\nSensitivity\n\nDiscrimination\n\nAssessment\n\n>0.5"\n\nRadar\n\nd=lcm\nh = 1500 km\n\nX-section\nOrbit\n\nSensor\n\nR>0.3\n\nSearch Wide\nField of View\n\nLaser\nSensor\n\nSensitivity\n\nd=lcm\n\n_>0.5"\n\nh = 1500 km\nR>_0.3\n\nAdequate\n\nSearch Wide\nField of View\n\nPassive\n\nSpin Orbit\n\nDiscrimination\n\nAssessment\n\nX-section\nOrbit\n\nSensitivity\n\nImmediate\n\n4 hours\n\nSpin\n\n(twilight)\n\nOptics\nSensor\n_>0.5"\n\nd=lcm\nh = 1500 km\n\nFigure\n\nbuilt\n\nup\n\nhigh\n\nsensitivity,\n\nby\n\nsweeping\n\nrapidly\n\ncould\n\nUltimately,\nwidth\ntracking\n\ncould\n\nof\nbe\n\ntracking\n\nlarger\n\n100\n\nwill\nmrad.\n\nif the\n\nmechanism\n\nbe\nThis\n\nfine\n\nof\n\nrange).\n\nthe\n\nThe\n\nfields\n\nfield\n\nTo\n\nof\n\nis capable\n\nof\n\nview.\n\nrequirements.\n\nThe\n\npattern\n\nHaystack\nthat\n\nradar,\n\nwould\n\nmust\n\nbe\n\ndetermined\n\nof\n\n0.5 \xc2\xb0 (9,000\n\nmrad)\n\nbe\n\nto within\n\nregard\n\ndistinguish\n\ncorresponds\n\nsystem\n\nin a bowtie\n\nparticle\nfield\n\nneeded.\n\ntracking\n\nORION\n\nseveral\n\na 0.5 \xc2\xb0 wide\n\nposition\n\nslant\n\nmechanism\n\ncrossover\n\nthrough\n\nscan\n\nthe\n\nat 2,000-kin\n\n10.\n\ncoarse\n\nto about\nof\n\n200\n\nfinding\n\nfrom\n\nfine\n\nthe\n\nobject\n\nexample,\n\nwith\n\n"leak\n\nproof."\n\nabout\nis\n\nof\n\nin a larger\n\n0.4\n\nso much\n\ntracking,\n\nm at a distance\n\nfor\n\nvirtually\n\nwe\n\n2,000\nfield,\n\nmrad\n\n(70\n\nlarger\nset\n\nkm.\n\ncm\n\nactual\n\nsmaller\n\nbeam\n\na fine\n\na somewhat\nThe\n\nor\n\nthat\n\nits\n\narbitrary\ncrossover\nif the\n\ncoarse\n\nis very precise.\n\nTwenty-four\nhour, remote operability\nin all weather conditions\nnot operate at all times or in all conditions,\nthen either the laser average\n\nwould be ideal.

In section 5, these were\nsynthesized\nto form a full set of constraints.\nIn this section, we review existing laser technology\nin the\nlight of the constraints.\nLaser technology\nis reviewed in appendix F. We will see that the requirements\nconverge on a wavelength\nnear 1 mm and either a pulsed solid state laser or a CW gas laser.\n\n6.1\n\nPulsed\n\nSolid-State\n\nLasers\n\nSolid-state\nlasers have the highest pulse energies available at this time. Each of 10 beams of the\nNova laser at Lawrence\nLivermore\nNational Laboratory\n(LLNL) produces\n10 kJ per pulse. The Beamlet\nlaser at LLNL produces\n20 kJ per pulse. Both of these are Nd:glass lasers. Pulse durations\nof about 1 to\n50 ns are typical for Nd:glass lasers. Thus, these lasers operate in the ORION comer of opportunity\nfor\nreasonably\nsized apertures.\nFor example, for a 10-kJ pulse lasting 10 ns, SRS can be avoided (at 1 mm)\nfor apertures larger than about 0.4 m.\nThe fundamental\nwavelength\nof the Nd:glass laser is 1.06 mm, which is in the visible/near\ninfrared\nwindow.\nThe visible wavelength,\n0.53 mm, is derived with high efficiency\nby frequency\ndoubling in a\nKDP crystal. The shorter wavelength\ninitially appears attractive, since a smaller aperture is required to\nproduce a given spot size. The SRS limit is more stringent for the shorter wavelength,\nhowever,\nand the\nbeam correction\nwould require unproven\nmultiple guide star technology.\nFor the near term, then, the 1.06\nmm wavelength\nis favored, with the shorter wavelength\na strong future possibility.\nThe highest power lasers today are designed for low repetition\nrates. Beamlet, for example,\noperates at under 0.02 pulses per second. The difficulty\nwith higher rates is that nonuniform\nheating of the\namplifying\nmedium degrades the optical quality of the beam. Beamlet can be operated continuously\nat its\ndesigned rate because the cooling system minimizes\nnonuniform\nheating as long as its maximum\nrepetition\nrate _s not exceeded.\nIf we are to accomplish\nORION\'s\ntask without proposing\nlasers much more powerful\nthan those in\nexistence,\nwe must increase the repetition\nrate, or else the deorbiting\nof the debris will take far too long.\nWe are aware of two ways to overcome\nthe repetition rate limitation. One is to fire the laser rapidly without\ncooling and to allow the amplifying\nmedium to heat up uniformly\nso that optical quality is not affected.\nThis is called the "\'hot rod" mode. It is modeled in detail in appendix A. It should be possible to fire up to\n1,000 pulses in a short time interval before the laser is cooled for the next round.\nSmaller lasers have proven that higher continuous\nrates are possible. At LLNL, for example, a\nlaser that produces\n100 J per pulse operates at 6 pulses per second, and is being upgraded\nto 12 pulses per\nsecond. Although cooling of the medium results in nonuniformities,\nthe optical quality is actively corrected\nwith a stimulated\nBrillouin scattering\n(SBS) mirror. The design of such a system is treated in appendix F.\nOverall, the Nd:glass laser at 1.06 mm was found to be the laser with the best potential\nplishing the mission. The technology\nis widespread\nand developing\nrapidly because of activity\nresearch.\n\n20\n\nfor accomin fusion\n\n6.2\n\nPulsed\n\nChemical\n\nand\n\nGas\n\nLasers\n\nCO2 gas lasers operate\nin the mid-infrared\n(IR) band, at wavelengths\nof 10.6 and 11.2 mm. In\norder to be competitive\nwith solid-state\nlasers, they must either be made much more powerful\nor a much\nlarger aperture\nmust be used. For example,\nsince the wavelength\nis 10 times that of the Nd:glass\nlaser, a\ntelescope\n10 times larger would\nbe needed\nto produce\nthe same diffraction-limited\nspot size. This would\nmake the telescope\ndiameter\non the order of 40 m. If, instead,\nthe same size telescope\nwere contemplated\nfor both lasers, the power\nof the CO2 laser would\nhave to be 100 times greater\nto produce\nthe same fluence\non the target.\nSRS would\nthen become\na limiting\nfactor.\nEither\nsolution\nwould\nbe very expensive.\nTwo other lasers that operate\nbetween\nthe near- and mid-IF\nregions\nare HF/DF\nchemical\nand the\nCO lasers.\nNeither\nis as well developed\nas Nd:glass\nor CO2 lasers.\nThey suffer,\nto a lesser degree,\nfrom\nthe same limitations\nas the CO2 laser at longer\nwavelengths.\nThe DF laser is included\nin figure\n11 for reference.\nTechnical Basis for Choosing ORLON Laser Device (Longer-term Example)\n\nLaser\n\n(km)\n\n1-20--cm\nClear Time\n(yrs)\n\nDebris\nIntensity\n(MW/cm 2)\n\n500-1500\n\n<5\n\n"_>5-10ns:\n600-850\n\nNonlinear Effects\n(SRS,STRS,n2)\n,_>10ns:\nIatm>3MW/cm\n2\n\nAtmospheric Windows\n\nII!1\n\nDebris alt.\n\nDebris\nFluence\n(J/cm2)\n\nI\n0\n\nRepPulsed\nLaser\nOptions\n\n2\n\n_\n(p.m)\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\nLaser Pulse Beam Fluencein SRS-SaIe Beam GuideBeam\nFluencein\nstars\nEnergyfor\nSizeat\nAtmosphere\nEfficient Thrust\nAtmosphere Needed\n1500 km\n(J/cm2)\n(kJ)\n(J/cm 2)\n(cm)\n1 ps\n\nPulse Width:\n\n10ns\n\nI ItS\n\nIOns\n\n1 ps\n\nCost ($M)\n\nlps\n\n10ns\n\n54\n\n23\n\n* Cheaper\nButGuidestar Kluge\n\n100\n\n10ns\n\n40\n\nBestCostThat\nWorks\n\n290\n\nHighCost,\nWon\'t Work (SRS)\n\n4*\n\nNd Solid\nState\n\n0.53\n\n24\n\n24\n\n3.0\n\n0.085\n\n0.011\n\n2\n\n004\n\nNd Solid\nState\n\n1.06\n\n48\n\n97\n\n12\n\n0.34\n\n0.043\n\n2.5\n\n0.05\n\nDF Chemical\n\n4\xc2\xb1\n\n180\n\n1370\n\n170\n\n4.9\n\n0.61\n\n2.5\n\n0.06\n\n0\n\n1920\n\nCO2Gas\n\n10.6\n\n480\n\n9700\n\n1200\n\n34\n\n4.3\n\n3\n\n0.07\n\n0\n\n11400 1700\n\nCWLaser\nOption\n\nIodine\nGas\n\nWave- 1500 km\nLength Beam dia\n_m\n(cm)\n\n1.3 CW\n\n59\n\nFigure\n\nLaser Power\nfor Efficient\nThrust (kw)\n3200\n(Power Overkill\nNecessary for\nThrust)\n\n11.\n\nTechnical\n\n(difficult)\n\nBlooming-safe GuideIntensity in\nstars\nIntensity in\nAtmosphere\nAtmos.

The wavelength of 1.3 mm is not far from the Nd:glass wavelength\nand just inside the near infrared window.\nThe repetition\nrates of iodine lasers are as high as 1 pulse per second, with higher rates under\ndevelopment.\nIt is interesting\nto note that these lasers can be made to operate in a CW mode. The\nROTOCOIL\nlaser at the USAF Phillips Laboratory\nis an iodine laser at 1.3 mm with a continuous\npower\nof 40 kW. Although\nthis is somewhat\ndifferent from the pulsed mode of operation we had envisioned\nfor\nORION, our preliminary\nstudy indicates that it could accomplish\nits objectives.\nIn a CW mode, the intensity must be kept well below the peak intensity of a pulsed laser in\navoid thermal blooming\nand STRS. Even so, the average power must be greater than for the pulsed\nsince short pulses couple most efficiently\nat lower fluences. These two conditions\ncan be met, since\nCW laser is constantly\nin use, where the duty cycle of the pulsed laser can be 10 -6 or less. We will\nan iodine CW option in one of our systems to consider for subobjective\nB.\nData on all the lasers considered\n\n6.4 Relevant\n\nElectro-Optical\n\nare included\n\nin figure\n\norder to\nlaser,\nthe\ninclude\n\n11.\n\nTechnology\n\nThe laser system consists primarily\nof a beam director, a guide star subsystem\nfor optical correction, a coarse track handoff system, a fine track subsystem,\nand a high-energy,\npulsed laser. Large aperture systems with corrective\noptics were identified as part of this study. Many of the details are reserved\nfor appendix\nE.\n\nemploys\ndetection\nmission.\n\nThe Advanced\nElectro-Optical\nSystem (AEOS) located in Maui, HI, is shown in figure 12. It\na 3.6-m primary mirror. This facility\'s\nmission is high-accuracy,\nhigh-sensitivity\nsatellite\nand tracking. The STARFIRE\nfacility located near Albuquerque,\nNM, is intended for a similar\nIt employs a 3.5-m aperture for high-sensitivity,\nhigh-accuracy\ntracking.\n\nAEOS and STARFIRE\nuse adaptive optics with a single guide star to correct wavefront\naberrations due to atmospheric\nturbulence.\nThe tracking rates are about 18 \xc2\xb0 per second in azimuth and 5* per\nsecond in elevation. These rates are sufficient to accomplish\nthe ORION objectives.\nAlthough costs will be\nconsidered\nin more detail in section 8, it is interesting\nto note that STARFIRE\ncosts included $7 million for\nthe primary mirror and $10.5 million for the telescope mount. Total facility costs came to about $27\nmillion.\nAnalyses such as this have shown that there are several possible directions\none might take to\naccomplish\nsubobjectives\nA and B. Subobjective\nA could be accomplished\nwith a 1.06-mm laser using a\n3.5-m mirror. Operation\nwould be within the corner of opportunity\nwith 5-ns, 5-kJ pulses. The time\nneeded to do this depends on the tracking and handoff system, which will be discussed\nin the next section.\nIf the sensor system were not capable of 24-h operation,\nthe subobjective\nA could still be accomplished\nby\nusing a somewhat\nlarger telescope\nto obtain a more intense beam.\nRecall that subobjective\nB raises the coverage\nfrom 800 km to 1,500 km. This will require more\nenergy on target at greater range. Three laser systems are promising\nin this regard. One is to develop a\nBeamlet-type\nNd:glass laser for high pulse rates at 10 to 20 kJ per pulse. A 6-m diameter mirror would be\nneeded to avoid SRS. Alternatively,\na 0.1-ns pulsed Nd:glass laser could be developed\nto take advantage\nof the increase in the SRS threshold\nwith decreasing\npulse duration.\nThe third option that seems feasible\nfor this subobjective\nis the CW iodine laser. This would also require a 6-m adaptive optics telescope.\n\n22\n\nAdvanced Electro-Optical System\n3.67 m Telescope Facility\n\nDomeAperture\nDome Roof\n\nActuators\n\nUpper\nDome\nWall\nLower\nDome\nWall\n\nEight\nHydraulic\nSyslems\n\nExp.\nRoom\n\n36.6 m concrete telescope pier\n\n25 cmc.a. secondary:\n3.63 m c.a.

Detecting,\nacquiring,\nand coarse tracking a particle the size of a\nmarble at 2,000 km is a challenging\nrequirement.\nHanding off to a laser engagement\nsystem is another\nchallenging\nundertaking.\nSeveral options have been identified that can satisfy the requirements\ndictated by\nthe debris population\ncharacteristics.\nOne proven technology\noption has been the MIT Lincoln Laboratories\nHaystack\nradar. Another is the STARFIRE\npassive optical satellite tracking system in Albuquerque,\nNM.\nThus, there is substantive\ntechnical\nmargin for this aspect of the problem.\nIt is logical to consider active optical tracking, with either a pulsed or CW laser, making\npusher laser in a defocused\nmode. We will see that this has the potential\nto extend the availability\ntracking from the 4 h per day of the passive option to nearly 24 h per day.\n\nuse of the\nof optical\n\nAlso considered\nin this section is the possibility of using existing communications\nsatellite technology to perform debris detection.\nThe forward scattering enhancement,\nmade possible by the location\nsatellites in orbit, makes this scheme possible. The fact that existing systems might be used parasitically\nmakes this option attractive from a cost standpoint.\n\nof\n\nAlong with the foregoing,\nit is important\nto consider the handoff to the laser system and whether\nthe radar can be used remotely.\nFor example, building a clone of Haystack at an optimum laser site would\ncost on the order of $80 to $100 million. Remote radar support during operations\npromises to save the cost\nof building a new radar. With all the requirements\nin mind, we now explore radar, passive optics, bistatic\nradio frequency\n(RF) detection (using communication\nsatellites to illuminate\nthe particles), and laser radar.\n\n7.1\n\nMicrowave\n\nRadar\n\nOption\n\nThe advantages\nof radar include all-weather\noperation and relatively high accuracy in position and\nsignature.\nAs mentioned\npreviously,\nthe Haystack radar developed\nand operated by MIT Lincoln Laboratories at Tyngsboro,\nMA, (42.6* N latitude) is an example of proven radar technology\nwith the potential to\naccomplish\nthe ORION mission. The facility is depicted in figure 13. Haystack\nis probably the most sensitive radar in the world capable of achieving the tracking rates necessary\nfor ORION. Haystack\noperates at\n10 GHz with a range resolution\nof 1 to 10 m and an angular resolution\nof 10 to 50 mrad. Its range rate performance\nis 0.1 to 1 crn/s. Given these performance\nvalues, Haystack\nwould be suitable for use in the\nORION\nsensor mission.\nWith Haystack, the disadvantage of being in a nonoptimum\nenvironment\nfor the laser may be ameliorated by remote handoff. In principle,\nthis is primarily\na software development\nand integration\ntask,\nwhich Lincoln Laboratories\nbelieves can be done with existing technology.\nThe advantage\nof this development would be to utilize the advantages\nof Haystack without having to clone it at the laser facility site (a\nvery expensive\nundertaking).\nThe general importance\nof this development\nis that the handoff technique could be applied to any\nradar. ORION could use any radar that might be available and suitable. One penalty for using Haystack\nremotely would be its latitude, which constrains\nthe minimum\ninclination.\nThis is expected to be only a\nminor disadvantage\nsince it can see the majority of the debris populations.\n\nfield of\ntracking\nthe laser\nrequired\n24\n\nSearch and acquisition\ncould be accomplished\nusing a two-dimensional\nbowtie scan to build up the\nregard. Such a scan pattern at 30 \xc2\xb0 elevation would be virtually leak proof. The radar would provide\nand discrimination\nof the target with a resolution\nless than 200 m. A resolution cell on the order of\nbeam size (about 1 m) is needed for laser engagement\nwith the particle, so the radar would be\nto hand off to a fine track system.\n\nCanonical Microwave Radar Ior ORION\n\nLongRange Imaging Radar\nHigh Power Transmitter (200 kW)\nLarge, PreciseAntenna (120 ft)\n\nLocation\n\nWidebandCapability(1 GHz)\nSensitive Receiver\n\nTyngsboro, MA (42.6" N, 272\xc2\xb0 E)\n\nRadar Frequency 10 GHz\n(S/N on 1 sq. mile target at 1000 km range)\n\nSensitivity\nPulseLength\n\nS/N Ratio\n\n(ms)\n2.0\n5.0\n\n(db)\n61\n65\n\nTrackingPrecision\nRange\n1--10 m\nAngles\n50 _Lrad\nRange rate\n.1-1 cm/s\nFigure\n\n13.\n\nHaystack:\n\ncanonical\n\nmicrowave\n\nradar\n\nfor ORION.\n\nOf course,\nthe engagement\nlaser itself could be used in the fine track role by simply\ndefocusing\nthe\nbeam to capture\nthe particle\nin the 200-m\npixel provided\nby the radar, and then walking\nthe resolution\ncell\nsize down to 1 m. At this point, the laser would\nengage\nthe particle\nin order to lower its perigee.\nIn addition to the other advantages\ncle\'s orbit was affected.\n\ndiscussed,\n\nradar\n\nprovides\n\nknowledge\n\nafter\n\nthe engagement\n\nas to how\n\na parti-\n\n25\n\nOf course, the engagement\nlaser itself could be used in the fine track role by simply defocusing\nthe\nbeam to capture the particle in the 200-m pixel provided by the radar, and then walking the resolution\ncell\nsize down to 1 m. At this point, the laser would engage the particle in order to lower its perigee. In addition to the other advantages\ndiscussed, radar provides knowledge\nafter the engagement\nas to how a particle\'s orbit was affected.\nRemote handoff is extremely promising.\nIt is expected that a reasonably\nstraightforward\ndevelopment will resolve information\ntransfer concerns and minimize\ninformation\ntransfer time lags. Coordinate\nconversions\ncould be accomplished\nby modem computers\nin near-real time either at Haystack or at the\nlaser facility. The USAF Phillips Laboratory\nis presently investigating\npredictive\naccuracy in using such an\napproach.\nA demonstration\nproject would be needed to complete\na detailed solution.\nAlthough\nHaystack is the flagship of operational\nUSAF radar, other existing radars including\nthe\nUSAF HAVE STARE (with significant modification)\nwould be viable candidates\nfor accomplishing\nthe\nORION\nsensor mission, either collocated or in the remote mode.\nMicrowave\nradar approaches\nthe ideal of 24 h per day operation in all weather. It can operate in the\nday or at night, and even in cloudy conditions.\nWe have estimated\nthat Haystack\nor another radar would\nprovide\nup to a 20-h operating window per day, allowing\nfor severe weather and maintenance\ntime.\n\n7.2\n\nPassive\n\nOptics\n\nOption\n\nUsing Sun reflection from the debris particle, high-sensitivity,\nhigh-resolution\npassive optics\noffers the advantage\nof low cost as compared\nto building a new radar. Developing\na remote handoff capability for the radar offers the attractive approach of a complementary\nradar/optics\napproach.\nThis is important, since surveys show that some debris detected in visible light is not detected by radar, and vice versa.\nPassive optics also provide immediate feedback that the particle was successfully\nengaged by the laser,\nsince plasma ignition produces a bright flash in the visible.\nThe disadvantage\nto passive optics alone is that it only operates during times of clear weather when\nthe Sun/particle/observer\nangles are appropriate.\nThis alignment\ntypically provides a 4 h per day window\nfor operations.\nAs will be shown later in discussing\nORION\nsystem options, using passive optics alone\nwill extend the clearing time beyond 2 years for the debris population\nunder 800 km. We have been able to\nkeep it to 3 years by using a larger mirror than for the microwave\nradar option. Another disadvantage\nis\nthat orbit assessment\nwould be difficult with a passive optics system alone. Orbit assessment\nis proven\ntechnology\nexisting at Lincoln Laboratories\nand also used with STARFIRE\nand AMOS.\nFigure 14 shows the STARFIRE\nfacility. A single facility this size located in a suitable location\n(e.g., China Lake) could accomplish\nboth the detection and tracking mission and the particle engagement\nmission.\nIn short, a single $50 million facility such as this could protect ISS and all other assets under 800\nkm.\n\n7.3\n\nThe Bistatic\n\nDetection\n\nOption\n\nOrbital debris is continuously\nbeing illuminated\nby a\nlocated on the ground, in LEO, and in geosynchronous\norbit\nfunctions\nof such satellites, and is available to ORION at no\nnumbers of communications\nsatellites in the next few years,\npotential\nilluminators\nfor use in ORION surveillance.\n\n26\n\nnumber of communications\ntransmitters\n(GEO). This illumination\nis due to the normal\ncost.

STARFIRE:\n\nexample\n\noptical\n\nsystem.\n\nOne major implementation\noption makes use of the fact that the debris target forward-scatter\ncross\nsection can be much larger than the back-scatter\ncross section usually used for surveillance.\nThis is true\nwhen the target is large compared\nwith the wavelength\nof the radiation, and is nearly in line between the\ntransmitter\nand the receiver (i.e., scatter angle close to 180\xc2\xb0). The most interesting\nsuch application\nof the\nforward-scattering\nenhancement,\nwithout placing any requirements\non the communications\nsatellite, is to\nplace a special antenna array on the ground that would look for radiation scattered or diffracted\nby debris\nfrom any normal satellite downlink\nsignal. The large numbers of satellites (close to 1,000 in LEO in the\ntime frame of the year 2000) would assure that favorable geometries\nfor detection of debris objects occur\nfrequently.\nAnother implementation\noption is to use a ground receiver to detect the radiation scattered forward\nby the debris from the communications\nsatellite\'s\nuplink signal. This differs from conventional\nradar only\nin that the transmitter\nand receiver are not collocated,\nwith the forward scattering\nangle being between 0 \xc2\xb0\nand 180 \xc2\xb0. While with this option the transmitter\nis much more powerful than the typical spacecraft\ntransmitter, most large radars are still more powerful than communications\nuplinks. Nonetheless,\nthese uplinks\nare "free" to ORION, and so will also be considered\nfor debris detection.\n\n27\n\nThe details of our analysis of the bistatic detection option are contained in appendix\nG. Main results\nwere the characterization\nof the detectable\ndebris size as a function of the downlink frequency,\nsatellite\naltitude, and receiving\narmy size and geometry.\nThe detectable debris size decreases\nas the array size\nincreases\nand as the frequency\nincreases.\nFurther improvement\ncan be made if the target is illuminated\nover\nseveral receiver beam widths. The forward-scattering\nenhancement\nis greatest for shorter path lengths, and\nwhen the target is near either the transmitter\nor the receiver. The implications\nare that for a given power\ndensity reaching the ground, the debris is more easily detected with signals from LEO satellites\nthan GEO\nsatellites\xe2\x80\xa2 This is true even taking into account the larger antennas and powers of GEO satellites.\nIn order to model the potential of the bistatic detection, a baseline calculation\nwas performed\nfor a\ndebris particle orbiting at 500-km altitude. The baseline frequency is taken to be 20 GHz, with the satellite\nplacing\n10 -]2 W/m 2 on the ground from an altitude of 800 km. The numbers are consistent\nwith existing\ncommunications\nsatellites. The theoretical\nlimit for a 25-m detector antenna is 0.1 m 2, or 30-cm debris\nparticles.\nThe situation improves\nfor other communications\nsatellite sources. There is an unusually\npowerful\ntransmitter\non the ACTS satellite in GEO. For a target in high-Earth\norbit (HEO), the disadvantage\nof\ngreater altitude is compensated\nby the fact that its effective radiated power is greater, a debris particle\nwould spend a greater time in its beam than for a satellite at a lower altitude, and the forward-scattering\neffect is enhanced\nby the proximity\nof the target to the transmitter.\nThis case is also shown as a curve in\nfigure 15, even though debris at this height was not the subject of the ORION study. With the ACTS\nspacecraft,\ndebris particles of 0.03 m 2, or 17 cm across, would be detectable\nnear GEO with a 25-m\nground receiver array.\n0.1\n\n30 cm\n\nA\n\nE\n\nv\n\nua\n,IC\n\n0.01\n\nACTS Illuminated\n\n10 cm\n\ntlJ\nI-\xc2\xa2.9\nI.M\n\nhe"\nD..\nI.M\n\nI-tu\n\nE\n\no.ool\n\n3 cm\n\nu\nZ\n\nFuture LEO\n\nUplink Illuminated\n0.0001\n\nI\n\nI\n\ni\n\nI\n\n0\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\n25\n\nf\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\n}\n\n50\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\n75\n\ni\n\ni\n\n100\n\nArray Size (m)\n\nFigure\n\n28\n\n15.

If a piece of orbital debris were to pass between such a satellite and\nan array on the ground in a favorable alignment\nfor forward-scattering\nenhancement,\nthe threshold detectable area would fall dramatically.\nFor an object passing within 50 km of the transmitter,\nthe threshold\ndetectable\nsize is 0.001 m 2, or 3-cm size, when using a 25-m detector array. Equally dramatic is the theoretical threshold\nfor detection of a target passing through the uplink beam of a powerful ground uplink\ntransmitter\nto a GEO satellite. In this case, the same detector array could detect 0.0004 m e, or 2-cm size\ndebris\n\nparticles\n\nat 500-km\n\naltitude,\n\neven though\n\nthe forward-scattering\n\nenhancement\n\nis absent\n\nin this case.\n\nThe calculations\nof detection performance\ndo not account for some losses in signal processing\nand\nare somewhat\nidealized, and thus practical systems would probably have lower performances.\nWhile practical systems would thus only be able to detect larger debris than indicated above, the use of larger antenna\narrays could compensate\nfor the losses. These larger arrays would be more costly, though they would still\nbe receive-only.\nThe implication\nis that bistatic detection can probably be effective for debris particles of a\nfew centimeters\nor larger. Further study must be done to see if a system concept is possible that would\nextend this performance\ndown to 1-cm size.\nIn summary, bistatic detection\non the ground is very promising\n\nradars\n\n7.4\n\nLaser\n\nRadar\n\nusing communications\nsatellites, radar satellites,\nand needs to be investigated\nfurther.\n\nand other tracking\n\nOption\n\nWith this option, the laser system itself would simply be used to perform both the sensing and the\nparticle engagement\nfunctions. As the altitude range to be searched increases, the laser energy must by\nfocused into smaller and smaller spots in order to give an adequate signal-to-noise\nratio. This requirement\nis in conflict with the need to search wider areas at higher altitudes. The conflict can be addressed\nby\nincreasing\nthe pulse repetition\nfrequency of a pulsed laser, but at some point the round-trip\nlight travel time\nwill become larger than the time between successive\npulses. At this point, the next outgoing pulse threatens to blind the detector to the return from the previous pulse. For altitudes above about 600 km, this\nmight require\n\na detecting\n\ntelescope\n\nseparate\n\nfrom the beam\n\nlaunching\n\ntelescope.\n\nThis laser radar option, while it appears to be feasible, greatly increases the complexity\nof the laser\nsystem. The sensing requirements\ndictated by the characteristics\nof the debris population\nwould drive the\ndesign to a 5- to 10-m mirror with multiple guide stars. Clearly, a remote radar and/or passive optics offers\nmore technological\nand cost margin for the 800-km objective. Choosing the objective of removing all\ndebris below 1,500 km makes the laser radar approach more attractive\nas one would already be forced to\nlarger\n\n7.5\n\napertures\n\nSensor\n\nto keep the engagement\n\nlaser spot size small at the longer\n\nranges.\n\nConclusions\n\nFour sensor approaches have significant\ncapability applicable to the ORION mission, thus substantive technological\nmargin has been found in the sensor technology.\nAs was shown previously,\nthis\nwas found to be true for the laser area as well. The findings are summarized\nin figure 16.\nThe two most promising\nnear-future options are the radar and the passive optics. Both offer _,ood\ntracking capabilities, good to excellent discrimination\ncapabilities, and excellent handover accuracy, t_oth\ncan search wide areas of space to detect 1-cm debris out to 2,000 kin. Both offer some damage assessment. Either option can satisfy ORION mission requirements.\nFor a demonstration,\nit may be advantageous to have both radar and optics operating together hand in hand. As will be shown later, the radar\noption is slightly higher in cost than the passive optics. Nevertheless,\nthe radar can operate in allweather/day/night\nconditions, so the rate of detection and hence the rate of debris removal is higher than\nwith the passive optics.\n29\n\nSensor Conclusions\n\nParameter\n\nRadar\n\nPassive Oplics\n\nBistatic System\n\nLaserRadar\n\nSearch\n\n8owtie\n\nWide FOV\n\nNone\n\nDefocus\norFence\n\n>5cm\n>lOcm\n> 20 cm\n\nlcm\nlcm\nlcm\n\nDetection\n500 km\n1000 km\n1500 km\n\n1 cm\n1 cm\n2 cm\n\nTracking\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nYes\n\nExcellent\n\nGood\n\nUnknown\n\nExcellent\n\nExcellent\n\nExcellent\n\nNA\n\nExcellent\n\nDamageAssessment\n\nExcellent\n\nPartial\n\nNo\n\nExcellent\n\nUtilization\n\n24 h/day\n\n< 4 h/day\n\n24 h/day\n\n24 h/day\n\nAvailability\n\nExists\n\nBuildable\n\nNew\n\nORION\n\nLow for\nHaystack\n\nLow for\nSTARFIRE\n\nUnknown\n\nORION+\n\nHigh/New\n\nModerate/New\n\nDiscrimination\n\nlcm\nlcm\nlcm\n\nHandoverAccuracy\n\nCost\n\nFigure\n\n16.\n\nSensor\n\nconclusions.\n\nWhile\nthe bistatic\ndetection\nsystem\noffers high potential\nfor reduced\ncosts, the\nwell analyzed.\nThe finding\nthat this approach\nhas the capability\nto detect at least 5-cm\nholds implications\nfor several\napplications,\nincluding\naugmentation\nof the USAF\nspace\ntems, and warrants\nfurther\nstudy.

As discussed\npreviously,\nthis is future technology\nrequiring\nsubstantive\ndevelopment.\n\n7.6\n\nHandoff\n\nA smooth\ntransition\nfrom coarse\nto fine tracking\nis vital to ORION.\nThe radar provides\nparticle\nlocation\nand velocity\nto a resolution\ncell about 200 m across\nat 2,000 km.

As the study unfolded, it became clear that a number of technical\napproaches\nwere feasible, adding confidence.\nFinally, these technical approaches\nwere found to have reasonable costs as compared\nto other orbital debris mitigation\napproaches.\nThroughout\nthe study, cost was viewed as a key factor in developing\nconfigurations.\nCosts were\nprimarily\ndetermined\nby analogy, supported\nby NASA costing models. As a result, two demonstration\nexperiments\nhave been identified, and five affordable\nsystems may work, pending the results of a demonstration.

Detailed\n\ncost breakdown\n\n(continued).\n\nFor a cost on the order of $160 million, orbital debris removal can be demonstrated\nas part of a\nphased program\nand the envelope\nof coverage\nextended\nto 1,500 km. Configurations\nB 1, B2, and B3\nremove all debris below 1,500 km (about 150,000 particles). Costs grow because requirements\ndictate\nlarger primary mirrors (5 to 10 m).\n34\n\nFor example, option B 1 total costs were derived to be $140 to $176 million. The breakdown\nfor\nthis configuration\nincludes a 0.1-ns pulsed Nd:glass\nlaser operating at 2 to 4 kJ and 1 to 5 Hz and costing\n$45.9 to $66.9 million. Also included is a Government-furnished\ntelescope\nwith a 6-m adaptive primary\nmirror costing $57.3 to $60.3 million. A new sodium guide star subsystem\ncosts $7.1 to $10.7 million.\nThe radar subsystem\ncosts $16.9 to $21.9 million. Integration\ncosts are expected to range from $12.2 to\n$15.5 million. This is a summary\nof a more detailed breakdown.\nThe total costs for the other configurations were derived in a similar manner.\nOption B2 would use a 10-ns Nd:glass laser both as a pusher and as a laser radar. The total cost is\nestimated\nto be about the same as for option B 1. For option B3, we have assumed the development\nof an\niodine CW laser operating at 2- to 4-MW average power. Our best estimate of the system cost is in the\nrange $172 to $239 million.\n\n9.\n\nNOT\n\nA WEAPON\n\nORION would make a poor antisatellite\nweapon. Each laser pulse ablates a layer only a few molecules thick. Thus, at the energy levels delivered,\nburning a hole through the skin of a satellite would take\nyears. Deorbiting\na satellite might be accomplished,\nbut it would take months of dedicated\noperation.\nHence, accidentally\nbringing down a satellite is not possible. Satellite sensors looking directly at the laser\nsite may be blinded, and some other spacecraft\ncomponents\ndamaged, but this can easily be avoided with\nthe proper operating procedures\nat the laser site. The procedures\nwould include avoidance\nof illumination\nof known spacecraft,\nwhich is a technique being used today with complete\nsuccess. As a result, the\nORION system could be operated without endangering\nany declared active spacecraft.\n\n10.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nThe orbital debris population\nposes a significant\nrently, millions of dollars are planned toward mitigating\ntion as well as shielding and maneuvers.\n\nthreat to the ISS and other assets in LEO.

The laser/particle\ninteraction\nand plasma dynamics\non\nextremely\nshort timescales\nare sufficiently\nunderstood.\nLaser propagation\nthrough the atmosphere\nis constrained by many effects including turbulence,\nabsorption,\nand SRS. Very short pulses allow us to work\nwithin the limits imposed by these physical phenomena.\nSeveral proven ground-based\nlaser and sensor technology\noptions have been found to allow construction\nof feasible systems. Sensor technology\nincludes ground-based\nradar systems (e.g., Haystack)\nand high-sensitivity\npassive optics that will provide the detection and coarse tracking. Laser options\ninclude a repetitively\npulsed Nd:glass laser operating at 1.06 mm with a 3.5-m adaptive optics primary\nmirror and a single sodium beacon. The integration\nof the sensor and laser options were more than suffi_\ncient to remove all debris below 800 km. An advanced system using technology\nbecoming\navailable in the\nnext 5 years will extend this envelope to 1,500 km.\nFor a cost on the order of $20 million, orbital debris removal can be demonstrated.\nFor an additional cost on the order of $60 million, or $80 million total, essentially.all\norbital debris in the 1- to 10-cm\nsize range below 800 km can be eliminated\nover 2 to 3 years of operation,\nthus protecting\nthe ISS and other\nassets (e.g., Iridium, Teledesic)\nagainst debris of these sizes. A cheaper system capable of debris removal\nonly to 500-km altitude could be used if the sole objective were to protect the ISS. For a total cost on the\norder of $160 million and an additional year of operation,\nthis envelope\ncan be extended\nto 1,500 km, thus\nprotecting\nboth ISS and Globalstar.\n35\n\nThebistaticdetectiontechnique\nusingcommunicationsatellites,houghnot selected inclusion\ns\nt\nfor\nin the recommended\nsystem architecture\nat present, may prove to be an inexpensive\nand readily implemented means to augment the nation\'s space surveillance\ncapability.\nIt may be particularly\nuseful to detect\nand catalog debris in the southern hemisphere,\nwhere there is a dearth of sensors at present.\n11.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nfeasible.\n\nRemoving\n1- to 10-cm debris from LEO using ground-based\nlasers and ground-based\nAll five debris categories\ncan be brought down in 2 to 3 years of ORION operations.\n\nsensors\n\nis\n\nThe study objectives\nhave been achieved.

Clearly for continuous 24 hrs / day operation, we require active\ncooling. However, for an operating mode where one 30 seconddebris\nengagement\noccurs every 10\nminutes or so in one two-hour period at dawn and another at dusk ( a very real possibility for a viable\nnear-term system), one must question whether ACTIVE cooling is necessary during lasing, or just a\nrapid cooldown between shots. These two operating scenarios can result in VERY different laser\ndesigns, with the former (active cooling while lasing) being a MUCH more difficult ( and hence timeconsuming and hence expensive)\nlaser design than a simpler, cheaper and potentially more robust\nsystem which simply needs to be cooled down between bursts. It is the latter system which is discussed\nin this report.\nB) Key Issues\nFigure 4 lists the issues which must be considered in any solid-state laser design as to damage,\nperformance\nas a simple laser energy source, and performance\nas a source of coherent radiation.\nWe assume in this report that issues of damage and performance\nas an energy source are taken care of\nby good engineering\ndesign.

Because the CW diode\n\nto the desired\n\nabsorption\n\nbands in the solid state laser, waste heat is limited\n\nto\n\nquantum efficiency effects in the pumped solid-state laser. However, these CW diode lasers are too low\nin power to pump the multi-kilojoule\nlasers required for ORION, so we are left with the conventional\npump sources --dominated\nby doped Xenon flashlamps. Figure 5 (ref 1) shows typical energy\ndeposition fractions compared\nto typical laser extraction. Perhaps only 8% of the input lamp power\nabsorbed by the laser gain medium, and only 2% of the input lamp energy appears as output laser\n\nis\n\nenergy. Hence, this figure would indicate that of the deposited energy in the solid state medium, 25% is\nemitted as radiation and 75% remains as heat. Figure 6 and 7 (from refs, 2,3 and 4) show more recent\nachievements\nin efficiencies,\nincluding the additional efficiency levels for cooled systems, either realtime actively-cooled\npumping\n\nin Figure\n\nor between-burst\n\ncooling\n\n7, and summarized\n\nbelow.\n\nas is discussed\n\nhere.

Note the thermal profiles immediately after the extraction and the slower-timescale\ndeposition (leakage) between extraction pulses due to the slow upper-state\ndecay which being excited\nthe pump light. Figure 10 shows the expressions\nfor the time-dependent\nheat deposition in the solid\nstate laser medium. Figures 11 and 12 list the equations used here to analyze the time-dependent\n\nby\n\nthermal profiles. Figure 13 shows the temperature change all along the optical axis of the final\namplifier stage immediately\nafter an extraction pulse. Clearly, the more solid medium is used (ie, the\nlonger the gain medium "L") the less is the temperature change, because of the increased heat capacity\nof the laser medium. After the extraction, heat continues to be deposited, because of the finite-rate\nleakage out of the upper states of the laser medium between pulses. Figure 14 shows the temperature\nchange a{l along the optical axis of the last amplifier stage JUST BEFORE the next extraction pulse\n(when the gain has been pumped up to design value).

These two models\n\n(\n\nnumber density and flux density distributions)\nare then used to obtain the requirements\non a purely-radar\nsystem\nas well as a purely-optical\nsystem to provide acquisition of all targets of interest ( currently estimated at between\n30,000 to 100,000 in number) in the orbital altitude regions of interest to NASA.\nDefinition of the Target Set\nAs can be seen in Figure\n\nI ( ref.\n\nl&2),\n\nthe 6 canonical\n\nobjects\n\nof interest\n\nto ORION\n\nare varied in size,\n\nshape, material, orbital parameters and optical properties. Since the majority, of the debris population is currently\nbelieved to be Target Class A (the NaK spherical solids), we shall concentrate on the acquisition of these objects,\nknowing that we will have to examine the robustness of the acquisition systems proposed for consideration\nas a\nresult of these analyses. Examination\nof Figure 2 shows a model for the current estimates of the population\ndistribution function (ie, the number densities of debris objects larger than a given size).

Hence the LOWEST\ndetection rate for debris in the high-density orbits would be 2.6 detections / hour. This is consistent with the\nHAYSTACK\nmeasurement\nof 6 detections / hour. The model is within a factor of about 2 of reproducing\nthe\nHAYSTACK\nresults, and gives us a more general tool to examine detection techniques and strategies.\nAs an example, a general search over the entire 300 to 1500 km altitude band set up on the basis of the\nTOTAL number of objects expected ( nominally 100,000 ) spread uniformly over the band would expect the\nobjects to have a 3D spacing of about 125 km, and a 2D separation of about 50 km. As seen on Figures 4 and 5\nThe beam sizes and scan rates so determined would find it very difficult to search the lower altitude region\n( where the debris density is far lower than the ensemble mean), and would produce much higher detection rates\nthan expected in the high-debris-density\nregion around 1000 km. For example, a narrow beam passive optical\nsystem (ie, one with no range resolution) searching for debris in the 400 - 600 km altitude region would, from\nFigure\n4, want to have a search Field Of Regard with a radius of about 200 km, and it would scan inside that\nradius with a Field Of View set by debris signature Signal-to-Noise\nand Signal-to\noptimized integration times and scan patterns.

Since the length of the radar pulse used was 1\nmillisecond,\nthe length of the "slug of light" moving along the radar line-of-sight\n(LOS) was 300 km, hence\nrange resolution is only on the order of 150 km in LOS. At orbital velocities of 7 krr_\'sec (appropriate\nto the 300\nto 1500 km altitude range), the stay time of a debris object in a 1 km wide beam is no longer than 0.14 second, so\none would think that high PRF\'s could be used to yield more data when a debris object entered the beam.\nHowever, since the round-trip time between the transmitter and the debris band was only 2 millisec ( Ibr 300 km\naltitude) to 10 milliseconds (for 1500 km altitudes), PRF\'s less than only 100 hz were allowed without "blinding\n" the received\n\nsignal with the next outgoing\n\npulse.\n\nThe achieved total detection rate of 6 / hr is too low for ORLON, especially considering the fact than\nabout 50% of these will be climbing toward zenith (and hence a candidate for the Pusher laser), but 50% will be\nexpected to be descending from zenith ,and so are not candidates.\nIn fact, at a useful detection\nwould take 33,000 hrs (4 years at 24 hrs/day, 365 days/years of dedicated operation) to detect\n\nrate of 3/hr, it\n100,000 debris\n\nobjects of interest, EVEN ASSUMING THERE WERE NO REPEATED DETECTION\nOF THE SAME\nOBJECT ON SOME SUBSEQUENT\nPASS OVERHEAD.\nClearly, a different approach is required.\nMIT has proposed that another approach to the use of the radar be considered to dramatically\nincrease\nthe detection rate : that of a "picket fence" rather than a stationary staring beam be used, along with a longer\npulse, to increase the measurement\narea from the single-beam\nl km x 100 km to one _ith 10 km (or more) x 100\nkm.\nIn the picket fence ( or as MIT/LL terms it, the "bow tie" mode) the beam would scan the sky at its\ncurrent scan rate so that effectively\n10 or more angular beam positions are used to define a broader area through\nwhich the debris must pass. Sincethe debris orbital velocity is on the order of 7 krrt/sec, and the inertial velocirv\nof a staring radar beam at the debris altitude is only on the order of 0.5 km/sec (inertial velocib\' = earth rotation\nrate x earth-radius-plus-orbit-altitude),\nit is appropriate to scale the measured entrance rate of detectable debris\nfrom the existing HAYSTACK data to the debris entrance rate into a beam "array" linearly with the measurement\narea\n\ninterrogated\n\nby the beam.\n\nThe fence would be erected\n\nnot at zenith, but rather at a low elevation\n\nangle, perhaps\n\nat 30 \xc2\xb0 elevation\n\nor\n\nless, to allow subsequent time for handover to the Pusher laser and for impulse deliver3. prior to debris reaching\nzenith.

Because\n\nwe are discussing\n\nground-based\n\nsystems\n\n(or at best\n\nelevations less than or equal to that of the AMOS facility in Hafvaii -- ie, 10,000 ft above mean sea level), the\noptical system will not be able to operate much below about 10\xc2\xb0 to 20 \xc2\xb0 elevation angle. This set of practical\nlimits however still allows the Pusher laser a range of elevation angles from about 40 \xc2\xb0 or 50 \xc2\xb0 all the way to 90 \xc2\xb0\n78\n\nto accomplish its impulse delivery function --a maximum of about 20 to 30 seconds. This will be important in\nhelping to scope the required ener_ level, spot size and pulse repetition rate required of the Pusher function for\nthe ORION laser.\nThe detection, acquisition and discrimination\nfunction co.uld be accomplished\nby:\n1. a microwave\n\nradar\n\n- with characteristics\n\nwith a scanned "picket\n\nfence" (repeated\n\ndiscussed\n\nabove,\n\nsimilar to the MIT/LL\n\nlinear one-dimensional\n\nHAYSTACK\n\nscan) or a "bow tie" (repeated\n\nradar, but\ntwo-axis\n\nscan).\n\n"_ a passive optical system - an astronomical-class\ntelescope\nperhaps with an angle-scanning\ncapability, along\nthe lines suggested by MIT/LL for a modified HAYSTACK-type\nradar.

For example,\nobjects/hour,\n\nthe HAYSTACK\n\nradar, in the mode used for NASA\n\nfor the detection\n\nof 6\n\nused:\n1. a stationary beam at 90 \xc2\xb0 elevation angle\n2. a beam divergence of I milliradians\nFWHM\n3. an interrogation\nrange of from 300 km out to 1600 km\n4. a pulse repetition\n\nFor these conditions,\n\nthe beam was about\n\nrate less than about 50 hz\n1 km in diameter\n\n(FWHM\n\npoints of the intensit3. _profile).\n\nThe orbital\n\nvelocity at 1000 km is about 7 km/sec, and so the stay-time of a potential debris particle is less than 1 km / 7\nkm/sec = 0.14 sec. At 50 hz, the radar can illuminate the object up to 7 times, making for a more precise\ndetermination\nof tracking data, but at the same time slowing up the detection process. Substantially\nhigher PRF\'s,\nhowever, can NOT be used because the round-trip time limits the PRF to less than 100 hz beyond which the\nreturn signal from the debris is "blinded" by the next outgoing radar pulse. This would not be the case if separate\ntransmitter and receiver dishes were used, but these instruments are extremely expensive, and the option is not\nconsidered further in this discussion.\nDividing the surface area of the spherical shell of debris around the Earth at an\narea of the 1 km radar spot gives 8.7 x 10 s such spots. If the radar or laser illuminator\nthese 1 km spots WITH JUST ONE PULSE at a PRF of 50 hz, slewing to a new angular\nand ever3\' pulse, it would take 1.7 x 10 7 seconds, or abom 6 months.

The\nangular\n\nrate capability of large optical systems is even higher (see Figure 7 ).\nClearly, the way to shorter total detection times is with larger measurement\n\nsingle-pulse beams (which may.require high energy pulses) or with slewed beams\nslewrate beam directors) for either radars or laser illuminators.\nThe total detection\n\nvolumes,\n\neither with large\n\n(which require controllabletime T*, interrogation\nrate co\n\n(new beam positions per sec), pulse repetition frequency PRF, single-pulse\ninterrogation\narea rt/4 d_2 , debris\naltitude H and total number of debris objects N, can be related by the following simple equations:\n1.

The Figure\nshows that the HAYSTACK radar beam divergence is I millirad, and so produces a 1-km-diameter\nspot ! 000 km\nrange. The stay-time of an orbital object in that beam at that altitude is no longer than 0.14 seconds, allowing\nlots of pulses to illuminate it and provide better information.\nSince the HAYSTACK has a maximum slew rate of\nabout 40 millirad/sec\n( 0.04 racFsec), it COULD be used to search the complete sk-y in about 90 hours of\noperation ( in 4.5 days of 20 hr/day operation). In such a mode of operation, the time the beam would take to\nmove one millirad would be about 0.025 seconds, and so would take a "snapshot" of the debris content of that 1\nmilliradian solid angle. There would be a low probability\nbefore the beam moved on.\n2.

However, the hardware should be protected by gating closed the\nreceiver during the transmission pulse, and slightly increasing the illuminator PRF (by say 30%-40%) to\ncompensate\nfor the potential of lost information\nduring the "receiver-closed"\nperiod.\n3. Picket\n\nFence analysis\n\nfor debris acquisition\n\nAs discussed above, MIT/LL has suggested the use of a HAYSTACK-type\nradar in a scanning mode to\nincrease the effective measurement\narea for detecting debris, and so to decrease the total time for detection of a\nlarge majori_ of the estimated 100,000 dangerous debris objects. In section what follows,\nwe took the\nHAYSTACK\ndetection data, and its estimated local debris flux Q (objects / sq. meter per year) vs altitude ( in\n100 km bins from 350 km to 1600 km orbital altitude), and computed\ncharacteristic\n3D separations between\ndebris objects assuming uniformly-filled\nspherical shells 100 km thick over this altitude range. Using this\ninformation,\nwe can calculate\nfollowing simple relation\nN (total\n\nthe time required\n\nno. of objects\n\nto detect N objects\n\nestimated\n\nto exist\n\nabove 1 cm in characteristic\n\nin shell\n\nAH thick\n\ndiameter\n\nat altitude\n\nby the\n\nH)\n\nT* =\nQ (objects/sq\n\nmeter\n\nper yr.)\n\nx (M d_pot ) x AH\n\nwhere M is the number of side-by-side F_q-IlVleam spot diameters making\nb\ninstantaneous\nFWHM diameter of the actively pulsed and slewed illuminator\nSight range bin used for data reduction (100 km for the HAYSTACK\nnomogragh\nin Figure 10.

This is because the\narrival rate at the measurement\nregion is correspondingly low.\n\n4.Passive\n\nOptical\n\nAcquisition\n\nThe concept of using reflected solar radiation to detect and acquire the debris is an attractive idea, since\nthe illumination\n(while weak) is continuous\nThis section evaluates its use along with existing telescopes and\nfocal planes to find, track and handover the selected ORION targets to the Pusher laser.\n84\n\n(/)\n\nD\n\ni\n_\no\n\nX\n\n_\n\no\n\n_\'-:---a\xc2\xa2\n\n:,l\n\n.--1\n\n!_o\n\n.....\n\n,r-\n\n,i-\n\n0\n\n-\n\n;\n\n;,\n\nx\n\n,-\n\n....\n\nG)\nG)\nC\n\n.\n\n0\n\n?\n\nL_\n\no\n\n-*_,_\n\n!\n\n......\n\n_-_\n\n_-.\n\n.,\n\n,\n\n,\n\n_r-\n\n,\n\n_\n\n>,\n\n*\n\n0\n\n" ...........\n\n"_\n\nJee_ Jed JO;,OUJ\nbs/_loe.fqo\nC) oseJ leAWe leOOl\n\nIL\n\no\n\nlla,qs q_q; tu_ OOL\nu! opn1!1le leOOl 11_sloa[qo _o jequunu\n\nO)\nim\n\nO.\n\n=\n\n0\n\no\nOOZ_ E\nv\n\n.=\nOOZ[.\nOOCj\nL\n\n00_ _ :="\n\noo_\n\nE\nv\n\nOOSI,\n\n00_\n\n:=-\n\nOOLI,\n\n_.\n\n006\n:\n\n,i,,,i\n\n_\n\n.\n\nJO\n\n=,\n\nOOCj\nOOE\nU.I\n\n-e\n,_\n\n00\xc2\xa3\n\n006\nOOZ\n\nooz\nOOCj\n\nq)\n\no\n\n0\n\n.e\n0\n\nL\n\xc3\xb7\n\no\n\n!\n\n,\n\n! ,-\'_%,\n\n_-\n\n+\n\no\n\n+\n\n+\n\nIleqs )lo!q$ m>l OOL\nu! stoe.l\'qo s.uqep ;o JeqLunu le_o\'l\n\n8.5\n\nThe reflected\nrAsph illuminated\n\nradiant\n\nintensity (watt / steradian)\n\nrAsph\nIsph (W/sr)\n\nsphere\n\nwith reflectivity-area\n\nproduct\n\n2\n\n-\n\n( sine\nn\n\nwhere a is the angle between\nconfiguration\n\nfrom a diffuse\n\nby the sun, is given by:\n\nas viewed\n\n+ (n\n\n- o" ) cos o ) Esu, (W / cm 2)\n\n3n\n\nthe detector\n\noptical axis and the sun.

Although\nsearching is only possible for the total of 4 hours per day at dawn and dusk, the entire altitude range 300 -1600\nkm can be completely searched to acquire the (currently-estimated\nfrom the MIT/LL data) 100,000 or so debris\nobjects 1 cm or larger in diameter in a period of less than nine to twelve months at current slew-rate capabilities.\nThe follwing Figure,\nFigure 14-A shows that to detect all of the objects in any given altitude bin ( an hence all\nthe objects in all bins) in under 1 year requires a fence about 10 km wide at altitude -about .010 radian. At slew\nrates of .030 rad/sec,\n\nacomplete\n\nraster scan would take 0.67 seconds,\n\nan easy task as can be seen in Fig 7.\n\n5.Active\n\nOptical Acquisition using a Repped-Pulse\nLaser Illuminator\nIn the above sections,\nthe validity of the passive optical acquisition system was established using sunlight\nas the illumination and slewed telescope as a collector so as to provide as much detection area as possible,\nleading to a total search time requirement less than 9-12 months. The active-slewing\napproach was necessary,\nsince the debris objects are only visible against a dark-sky background\n(ie at dawn and dusk) for a total of up to 4\nhours per day. The advantage of an active repped-pulse\nlaser illuminator is to provide illumination\non demand,\nnot just at dawn and dusk as with the Passive Optical Acquisition\nsystem described above. The equations\ndescribing the return signal photons are identical to those above, with the exception that the illumination\nis\nsingle-frequency\n(the laser wavelength)\nnot broadband (like sunlight), and that we have direct control on its\nintensity and duration, via the illumination spot size and laser pulse width.\nThe reflected radiant intensity (watt / steradian)\nilluminated by the sun, is given by:\nrAsph\n\nIt(W/SR)\n\nTprop,\n\npulse.\n\nTrlx, p\n\nEla_\n\nwith reflectivity-area\n\nproduct\n\nrA._ph\n\nTprop Elaser\n(rt/4)\n\nD2spot 17pulse\n\nis the laser pulse energy transmitted\n\nis the laser spot size chosen specifically\nThus, the signal photons on a pixel are:\n\nDspot\n\nArcvr\nNsig =\n\nsphere\n\nrt\n\nwhere\n\nfrom a diffuse\n\nup to the target through\nfor the search function,\n\nthe atmosphere\n\nwith transmission\n\nand T puJ_ is the duration\n\nof the laser\n\n1;pulse\n\nIsph (W/sr)\n\nTopt Tprop\n\nhv\n\nR2\n\nwhere it is assumed that all the signal photons collected during the integration\nby the receiver aperture Ar_,, are collected by a single pixel.\n\ntime tt\xc2\xb0teg\n\nThe sky photon counts on this same pixel are given by:\n\ntinteg\n\nd 2pixe I\n\nNsk,- =\n\nIskv (W/sr-cm2-btm)\n\nAr_,._ .A)_ --\n\nwhere tint\xc2\xa2_\nuncertainties\n\niS the integration time ( probably\nin arrival time and/or electronic\n\nsomewhat longer than the laser pulse width to allow for\nresponse times).The signal and sky background photons count\n\nnumbers per integration time must be multiplied\ncounts per integration time.\n94\n\nTopt\n\nhv\n\nf2\n\nby the detector\n\nquantum\n\nefficiency\n\nTIQ E\n\nto get the electron\n\nu_\nx\nE\n\ne,, o\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2_\n\n{/)\n\no\n\no\n\n(1)\n\n"c_\n\n(/) (/)\n\no\n\n:B\n\n=\'i\n,7,>\n\n==\nO\n\no\n\n\'\n\n\xc2\xb0=\n-I\n\nB\n\n\xc2\xa7.:\no\n\n(,3\n\nlleqs qo!q| \'"il 00_\nu! epnlP, le leOOl lll iloe|qo\nlo Jeqtunu\n\neli\nI,,i.\neli\nii\n\n,,,l:\n(,i\n\nt:_;i ,"\nill!l;\';\nI/;\'l i\'i\n\n:\n;\n\n_ ", :\ni\ni\n: \' i\n:i_\n\n,:i:i;_i _----\'100ZL\ni_i!l _ =_ J_\n:;;\nlie\n\ni\n\n.\n\nif:\n\n,\n\n;ii:iii.\n\n; ,\n\n,\n\ni_ i\n\nOOL\n\n.\n\ni\n\nE\n00_\n\ni,_;i_--_-i,_,T !_ll ,T--il,\nrr_rl ,_ :l oo0_.\n__\nil,_!; I, \'.\n:Jl\n!\nll:l;I\n:\n\nI\'ii;\'!(\n_\n\nI][]\n\nI\n\ni\',i;_!\'\n! \'.-;I\n\n;\n\ni_L_-:\'.._\'._-._, _-_.__ "I00_I,\n-_\n\ni\n\n,,\n\n:11\n\n_:_\n\n\'\'\n\ni\n\no\n\n;\n\n_\n\n_\n\n,_\n\ni.\n\n-I-\n\n,\n\n001_\n\n-- " --_ T--!i c - i___\n\n.\n\n\'.;_\n\nOOI,\n\n!_\n\nII\n\n!\n\nIHII_It\n\nI\n\n/\n\n\', IIii1!I\n! \'_\',_._\nI,,."L _ !L_!!! i ,\nI\nIi\nili!!_\nil!i t l i I\n\nIiil tl ;_l_ _1!1\n\n/\n\n006\n\n006\n\n/\n/\n\nu.:___\n\ni!_\',,\nli:Ic\n\nI\n\n\' " \'.-1! \',!\'\n\n."\'_.\n:\n\nE _;-,.\xe2\x80\xa2 i,\n\ni\n\nOO/..\n\n"i\n\no_\n\n!ill..\n\ni\n\n=l\n\nI "_\ni\n\ni ? _l_:\n\n"I_:ii!!\n;\n\n!\n\nOOl\n\n:,,,.\n\n00_\n00_\n\nILl\n\nLU\n\n.lee_ Jed m-b$\n\nU.I\n\n/ $1:)e.l\'qo\n\n13 \'ele.I le^.l.ue\n\nleOOl\n\nI.U\n\nUl\n\nLU\n\nIleqi\n\ni,l,I\n\n)l:)!ql\n\nool u:s_,.!qo I.uqep\n\nill\n\nUJ)l\njo JluJnu\n\nli:)o1\n\n95\n\n\xc2\xa3\no\n"G\nu\no\n\nThe pixel-with-target\ngiven, as it was above, by\n\noutput is then approximately\n\n(Nsig\nSNR\n\nratio is\n\nNsL._. ) - Nsk_.\n\n=\nsqrt\n\nwhere the readout\n\n-k-\n\nNsig + Nsk_ and the photon signal -to-noise\n\nphoton noise\n\n[(Nsig + Nsk,, ) + Nrea,:t 2 ]\n\nNread\n\nCCD readout\n\n=\n\nnoise electrons\n\nper readout\n\n/ r h.

Because of the variation of the spot size /\n\npulse energy requirement\nwith slant range, we choose a spot size characteristic\nof each of the slant ranges above.\nSince the laser illuminator spot is truly a quantity which can be varied from pass to pass of target objects, this is a\nvalid exercise\n\nto help choose\n\nthe required\n\npulse energy and hence size the laser device hardware\n\nrequired\n\nTable 5\nCharacteristic\nAlong with Target\n\nSpot Size Requirements\n\nfor SNR > 1\n\nStay Time in Spot ( Spot Diameter\n\n/ Orbital\n\nVelocity)\n\nFigure\n\n15 ---\n\n400 km slant range ---300 meter dia spot --<0.040\n\nsec stay time in spot\n\nFigure\nFigure\n\n16 --17 ---\n\n1200 km slant range --- 120 meter dia spot---<0.019\n3000 km slant range ..... 40 meter dia spot .... <0.007\n\nsec stay time in spot\nsec stay time in spot\n\nInspection of Figures 18, 19 and 20 rapidly shows that signal-to background\nratio (SBR or contrast ration)\nnot the problem we face here .... it is signal-to-noise\nratio SNR. At energy levels below about 300 joules per\n\nis\n\npulse, the SNR is always less than unity, and only is above about 2 at energy levels above about 1000 joules per\npulse, using this small receiver dish (3.75 meters). Our attempt to adjust integration time has no effect, and\nactually HURTS\nthe SNR for pulses longer than about 1 microsecond.\nTable 5 above shows the spot sizes\nrequired for this 1 kilojoule active illuminator (min energy for SNR > 1). In addition ,if we detect a potential\ntarget debris object in the spot, we would like to hit it at least 3 times to build confidence that it is a real object\nand not a spurious signal. Table 5 also shows a rough estimate of the maximum time a debris object will stay in\nthe beam (spot diameter / orbital velocity), in order to estimate the burst-mode capabilib" the illuminator should\nhave, to provide not only repped-pulse\nactive scanning\nbut also a burst of pulses to provide low false-alarm and\nhigh detection probability data that that given by a single return. A burst rep rate capability of 75 hz (i.e., 1 /\n(.040 sec / 3) to 425 hz ( 1 / (0.007 sec / 3) may be required of this i kj or greater laser used as an illuminator.\nWe conclude\norbital altitude\n\nthat initial detection\n\nby active illumination\n\nregion of interest 200-1500\n\nof the small 1 cm diameter\n\nkm, with a 3.75 meter receiver\n\ndebris\n\ndish at an elevation\n\nobjects\n\nin the\n\nangle of 30 degree\n\nis not very effective for small laser pulse energies. At laser illumination energies above 1000 joules, however, the\nconcept does become effective, but with small 40-300 meter diameter spots for the 400 - 3000 km slant ranges\nrequired. It would probably require pulse rep rates in excess of a few hundred hertz. If we now wish to use such\na system (pulse energies above 1 kilojoule,\n3.75 meter collector dish, pulse durations less than 1 microsecond\n),\nthen in order to survey the entire sky and acquire the estimated 100,000 objects in less than 1 year, the picket\nfence approach discussed above for the radar and passive-optics\napproach must be used. Figure 21 is a\nnomograph which calculates the side-to-side scanning requirements\nfor these small (40-300 meter diameter\nbeams.

A separate transmitter\nand receiver dish would, of course, work but is more expensive. At the longer range ( 1500 km altitude, or 3000\nkm slant range), the required laser is i 000 hz ( and at least 1000 joules per pulse !!! ), and because the optical\nround-trip time is now 0.02 sec with an interpuise time of 0.00| sec, a separate dish for the transmitter and\nreceiver is a necessity.\nWe must conclude from this that initials debris detection by an active illuminator appears to be a diMcult task, if\nit is to be used to acquire all the objects within a one-year time frame over the orbital altitude ranges of interest.\n6.Active\n\nOptical\n\nAcquisition\n\nusing a CW Laser\n\nIlluminator\n\nIn the above, the validly of the passive opticai acquisition system was established using sunlight as the\nillumination\nand slewed telescope as a collector so as to provide as much detection area as possible,\nleading to a\ntotal search time requirement\nless than 9-12 months (see Figure 21 ; 20 hrs day operation for i year results in\n7300 hours of search time). The active-slewing\napproach was necessary, since the debris objects are oniy visible\nagainst a dark-sky background\n(ie at dawn and dusk) for a totai of up to 4 hours per day. The advantage of an\nactive CW laser illuminator is to provide illumination on demand aii during the day and night if necessary\', not\njust at dawn and dusk as with the Passive Optical Acquisition system described above. The equations describing\nthe return signal photons are identical to those of the repped-puise\nilluminator, with the exception that the\nillumination\nis continuos,\nnot pulsed, it is, as was the repped pulse illuminator, single-frequency\n(the laser\nxvaveien_h)\nnot broadband (like sunlight), and we have the same direct control on its intensi_ and duration, via\nthe illumination spot size and laser pulse width.\nThe intensity\n\nlevels which can be delivered\n\nto the interrogation\n\nvolume\n\ndepends\n\nof course on the laser\n\npower level, the Strehl ratio for the beam at interrogation\nrange, the laser spot size chosen to do the searching\nthe atmospheric transmission from the transmitter to the range in question.

However, the spot diameter is only 30 cm in\ndiameter, and so the beam will have to be slewed rapidly to cover the entire sky in the picket fence search\n\nat\n\npattern\n\nin under one year.\nFigures 23 & 24 show the SNR and SBR for a ! micron CW illuminator producing 20, 200 and 2000\nw/cm2 at a 1200 km slant range against a daylight-sky background ( Figure 23 ) and against a moonless-night\nsky background (Figure 24). The parameters for the calculation are shown in Table 3. Neither background\nappears to pose a problem for a CW illuminator delivering 2 to 2000 watt / cm" at range, using relatively short\nintegration times.

No such 1.06 micron laser exists, but one could envision ganging 33 of the existing 1 kx_\n1.06 micron lasers, phase-locking\nthem and using the net beam.

To accomplish\nthis, the current HAYSTACK detection\ndata on this class of debris objects0ver\nthe orbital altitude region of interest dictates that the beam be scanned\nlaterally in a pattern termed a "bow tie" pattern to minimize leakage through the large planar measurement\narea\napproximately\n1 beamwidth thick, 10 (or more) beamwidths\nwide (azimuthal\nsinusoidal scan ) and the full orbital\nrange high (300 km to 1500 kin), controllably-oriented\nto put the large-area face perpendicular\nto the dominant\ndebris stream being measured. The RADAR would point at about 30 \xc2\xb0 elevation angle from the horizon, to\nprovide sufficient\nto zenith.\n\ntime tbr Pusher Laser irradiation\n\nbefore the\n\ndetected\n\ndebris\n\nhas risen in the sky from horizon\n\n2.\nThe angle-scanned\npassive-receiver\noptical system, using sunlight to illuminate the debris objects at\nboth dawn and dusk for approximately\ntwo hours each period also appears capable of the same success as the\nRADAR system described above by IVllT/LL. This approach would use sunlight as the illuminator source and\ndetect the diffuse scattering againsi a dark-sky background. We expect that a similar (low---say 30 \xc2\xb0) elevation\nangle from the horizon would be used as with the RADAR, for the same reasons. Detection in daylight using\nreflected sunlight appears impossible against the background\nof the bright day sky. The same concept of a\ncontrolled azimuthal scan to produce a "picket fence" measurement\narea ( configured as was the RADAR "bow\ntie") produces a large measurement\narea. However, it is also necessary to used a focal plane array which is\ncapable of "on-chip binning", to allow the collection of reflected signal photons from the debris object to be\ncollected on an addressable sub-array of pixels on the focal plane (with correspondingly-longer\nintegration times)\nand reading this sub-array out as a single "macro-pixel",\nso minimizing electronic read-out noise photoelectrons\nwhile maximizing signal photoelectrons.\nThe angle-scanned\npassive receiver dish (the same 3.75 meter system\nused for the Pusher Laser) appears able to accomplish the detection of the estimated\n100,000 debris objects of\ninterest to ORION in less than 1 year\'s time of dedicated operation ( 4 hrs / day, 365 days year).\n3.\n\nInitial debris detection\n\nby an active rep-pulsed\n\nanalysis, is very difficult. While it offers the opportunity\nilluminate the debris, not the sun), the active illuminator\n\nlaser illuminator,\n\nwhile\n\npossible\n\naccording\n\nto this\n\nof 24 hr / day operation(since\nit uses the laser to\ndetection concept appears to require substantial fluence\n\n(joules/cm 2) on target to achieve Simaal-to-Noise\nRatios greater than unit)\'. We find\nRatio (ie, the contrast between the dav sky and the reflected signal) is not a problem\ntechnique. The high required fluence implies high laser pulse energies and/or small\nsmall spots imply high pulse repetition frequencies to achieve the desired detection\nless than l year, even with the "picket fence" detection scheme.\nTrade-offstudies\n\nthat Signal-to-Background\nat all in this sensing\nillumination\nspots---however\nof the 100,000 object set in\nreported here indicate that\n\nfor very low orbits (the approximately\n200 km Space Shuttle altitude), the laser illuminator\'s\npulse energy and\nrep rate are low ( 300 to 1000 joule per pulse, at 20 hz using 300 meter diameter spots for illuminating,\nand a\npicket fence pattern approximately\n167 beamwidths\nwide ) .Attempting to achieve to same l-year total detection\ntime for objects at 600 km orbital altitudes (1200 km slant range), the laser energy could be the same, but the\nillumination\nspot has to decrease in size to provide more reflected photons which, over the longer path to the\nreceiver, would give the same SNR as for the lower altitude detection. Calculated\nrequirements\nfor the 600 km\n111\n\naltituderegionarefor a 300\ndiameter\n\n- 1000 joule laser pulse at 150 hz, using a 120 meter diameter illumination spot\nat the slant range of 1200 km and a picket fence pattern approximately\n420 beamwidths\nwide. The\n\nrequirements\n\nfor an illuminator\n\nuseful at the 1500 km altitude\n\n(3000 km slant range)\n\nare much more demanding.\n\n4.\nInitial debris detection by an active CW laser illuminator,\nwhile not extensively studied in this\nanalysis, appears certainly do-able. It offers the opportunity of 24 hr/day operation at moderate transmitter\npower levels. It\'s function is to simply act as a brighter sun in the measurement\nfence" scanned beam and same on-chip binning concepts as the sun-illuminated\n\narea, using the same "picket\ndetection scheme, and while\n\nsuffers a bit due to the lower quantum efficiency of detectors at 1 micron as compared to those in the visible (0.40.7 micron ), merely has to overcome sky back_ound.\nIt offers an additional plus--the transmitter might also act\nas a crude laser ranger, to assess the performance\nof the Pusher Laser after impulse deliver-,.\n\n112\n\nAPPENDIX\n\nENGAGEMENT\n\nC\n\nSTRATEGIES\n\nRamaswamy\nMIT, Lincoln\n\nAND\n\nRISK\n\nSridharan,\nLaboratories\n\n113\n\n2.

In particular,\nthe latter strategy might be forced on the ORION system if an adequately powerful laser cannot be found.\nThis chapter will analyze the risk entailed\nstrategies to be tested/followed.\n2.2.

This is a conventional way of representing risk to an orbiting resident space object (RSO). The\nobvious inference from the graph of debris flux is that the population is peaked at 800-1000 Kin.\nConsequently,\nthe risk to any operational spacecraft at this altitude regime(measured\nas flux/me/year) is\nsignificantly\nhigher than at other altitudes. Further, it is estimated that there are approximately\n120000\ndebris larger than 1 cm. characteristic size in orbit between the altitudes of 300 and 1500 Km.

Finally, it is important to note that the debris in this bin correspond to debris type A in our debris\ntarget matrix.\n\ni\n\n2.5E-05\n3.0E-05\n2.0E-05\n\n=_=\n,,=, 1.5E-05\nm\nI--\n\n1.0E-05\n\n_\n\n5.0E-06\n\no.o +oo=\n\nI\n\nu._\n\n300\n\n500\n\n700\n\n900\n\n1100\n\n1300\n\n1500\n\nALTITUDE (100 Km.

The Deluge\n\nBeam\n\nStrategy\n\nGiven an ORLON laser of sufficient power, this strategy would require the system to track and\nirradiate any debris piece that is detected. Per Glenn Zeiders\' calculations,\nit is adequate to reduce the\nperigee height to 5200 Kin. for a rapid re-entry and decay (in less than a day) of the debris in the\natmosphere.\nThe risk of such a strategy is the marginal increase in collision probability with the\nInternational Space Station due to debris transiting the 400 Km. altitude regime. However, as is evident\nfrom the figures above, the risk due to the current environment is very low - in fact the collision probability\nofa Intemational Space Station with a debris piece of >l cm. size is estimated to be I in 70 years. Hence,\ndespite the fact that an ORION system could "remove" - 100 debris objects per day, the increase in risk to\nthe International Space Station is minimal. Thus, the best strategy for ORION is the reduction of perigee\nheights of irradiated objects to below 200 Kin. However, according to Zeiders and Phipps, the penalty of\nthis strategy is a requirement of laser average power of 150 kW. (for debris of Type A) to 500 kW. (for\ndebris of Type D).\n2.3. The\n\n"Steady\n\nRain"\n\nStrategy\n\nThe major reason to look at an alternative strategy is the possible limitation on the power output\nof the laser. There is no extant laser that will meet the average and peak power requirements\nof the ORION\nsystem but lasers that can be scaled to meet the requirements\nessential to derive a strategy for debris removal that achieves\n\nmay be available.\nthe following:\n\nGiven such a system,\n\nit is\n\n!16\n\ni.

These are largely in the 650 inclination, near-circular\norbits\nwith sizes > 1 cm. Based on the putative parentage of these debris, they are expected to be near-spherical 3.\nType A in the debris matrix\n\nis representative\n\nof these objects.\n\nThe strategy then is to focus on the debris in the three altitude bins between 800 Km. and 1100\nKm. The acquisition sensor should develop and use a search strategy that maximizes the probability of\ndetection of these debris and should preferentially\nhand these debris offto the laser for irradiation.\nThe laser should ensure\n\nthat the debris is irradiated\n\nadequately\n\nto reduce the perigee\n\nheight by 100\n\n- 200 Km. The laser system or the radar should then track the debris so as to assess the change in perigee\nheight to facilitate book-keeping\nand to ensure that the perigee has not been put into or below the\nInternational\nSpace Station altitude bin. If it has, then more tracking resources must be brought to bear to\nassess any risk to the International\nSpace Station until the perigee height decreases below 200 Km.\nA great advantage of this strategy is that the point of irradiation becomes the apogee of the orbit.\nFurther, because the inclination of the orbit is close to the critical inclination, the argument of perigee\nmoves very slowly. Thus, further apparitions of the same debris over the laser would be near the apogee of\nthe orbit which, according to Zeiders, is the preferred point of irradiation for maximal effect on reducing\nthe perigee\n\nfurther\n\nheight.\n\nOnce the perigee altitude of the debris piece has been reduced in steps to the 400 Km. bin., any\nirradiation should seek to lower the perigee to 200 Km. so that the debris can decay rapidly.\nThe implications\n\nof the "steady\n\nI.

The debris sizes (1 - 10 cm.) that we are considering is a major driver in the\n\nchoice of frequency. Below L-band (-1300 MHz), the radar cross-section of debris smaller than 5 cm. is so\nsmall as to preclude effective detection.\nFurther, for a given small debris ( 1 - 5 cm.), the radar crosssection at > 10 GHz. frequency is -10 dB higher than at L-band or S-band (2 GHz.). Hence, the desirable\nrange of frequency\n\nof operation\n\nof a radar is X-band\n\n(I 0 GHz.) or higher.\n\nAt present, the high power tubes for X-band radars are easily available while for higher frequencies, such tubes are experimental,\nparticularly\nfor the high powers (-> 100 kW) required by this applica119\n\ntion. ence X-band istheideal\nH\na\nradar\noption\nwithaC-band\n(4GHz.) eing\nb\nanattractive\nalternative.\nHigher\nfrequencies\noftheorder fKu-band\no\n(16GHz) nd\na K-band\n(35GHz.) ay\nm beattractive\nalternatives\ninafewyears.\nThere\nareweather\nconsiderations\nweather\n\nhas negligible\n\nto be taken into account in radars too. Below C band, the\neffect on the radar. At X-band and above, moisture in the air and rain take an in-\n\ncreasing toll on the sensitivity of the system. For example, the sensitivity of an X-band radar could decrease by 3 dB. in heavy rain while the K- and W-band radars would suffer substantially\nlarger attenuation\nin humid atmospheres.\nHence it is preferable to operate a radar for the ORION system at lower frequencies.\nThe available radars and their parameters in the frequency ranges of interest are given in Table\n6.1. Notice that a UHF radar has been included because it is a high sensitivity phased array radar. The sensitivity of these radars is portrayed in the conventional\nmanner as the S/N ratio obtained on a single pulse\non a 0 dBsm.(or a I sq. meter) target at a slant range of 1000 Km. from the radar. A brief description of the\nradars and their operating characteristics\nis included in Appendix 6.1. Table 1 only lists the existing radars.\nRaytheon Company has paper designs for an upgraded X-band phased array radar and for a X-band interferometric radar system both of which would be suitable for the ORLON system; however, these are unfunded at present. Further, existing C-band radars have not been included because they are not sensitive\nenough to detect the small debris of interest to the ORION system. It is quite conceivable that an existing\nC-band radar could be upgraded with a bigger antenna (say 25 meter) in which case it would be a viable\ncandidate.\nThe Haystack radar is the most sensitive of the lot. It is exceeded only by the Arecibo and Goldstone radars neither of which are capable of tracking near-earth satellites and hence are not included in the\ntable. The HAVE STARE system is intermediate\nin sensitivity between Haystack\nHAVE STARE and HAX operate in the desired frequency range. The TRADEX\nthe Kwajalein atoll, has the same sensitivity as Millstone. There is a German radar\nenough for the ORION system requirements\nbut was not pursued further because\nas a University research radar and the lack of information\non its detailed operating\ncould be pursued in Phase 2 if desired).\n\nTABLE\n\n6. 1:\n\nAVAILABLE\n\nHAY\nSTACK\nSENSITIVITY (dBIpulse)\n(S/N on 0 dBsm at 1000 Km\nPULSE LENGTH (ms)\nFREQUENCY (GHz)\nRANGE PRECISION (m)\nBEAMWIDTH (deg)\nANGULAR RATE (deg/sec)\nENCODER LSB (mdeg)\nTRACK PRECISION (mdeg)\nPRF (Hz)\nLOCATION (deg.

Operation\n\nof Haystack\n\n(or similar)\n\nRadar\n\nfor ORLON\n\nA concept of operations will be described in this section for a radar to act as the "debris finder"\nfor the ORION laser. As part of the concept, the requirements/capability\nto perform all the functions tabulated in 6.1 will be stated.\n\n6.4.1. Autonomous\n\nDetection\n\nof Debris\n121\n\nIt is\n\nessential\n\nfor the radar to have adequate time to acquire, track, discriminate\n\nand handover\n\nthe\n\ntarget to the laser. The discrimination task will take several minutes to complete and hence it is essential for\nthe radar to acquire the debris early in its apparition. Hence, the optimum strategy is for the radar to point\nat -300 elevation and conduct a small scan. The choice of azimuth is dictated by the location of the radar\nand the inclinations of the orbits that are of prime interest. Since most of the debris are in high inclination\norbits, a radar on or near the equator could point due north or south at 300 elevation for detection. However, Haystack is located at 42.60 north latitude and hence pointing due south is recommended\nproves the inclination coverage significantly (see Appendix 6.1).\n\nas it im-\n\nThe Haystack radar (or an upgraded HAVE STARE radar) has a very small beamwidth\n(instantaneous field-of-view)\nof the order of 0.05 \xc2\xb0. Long experience with Haystack has established that in\na stare mode pointing straight up, the radar detects, using a 1 ms. pulse, an average of 6 debris targets/hour\n(see Chapter 2) between the altitudes of 500 Km. and 1500 IOn. At an elevation of 30 \xc2\xb0, the radar loses -9.5\ndB in sensitivity due to the increase in range for the same altitude range. However, using a 5 ms. pulse\nmode, the radar can regain 7 dB in sensitivity. Additionally, the debris targets transit through the beam at a\nslower angular rate (see appendix 6.1) thus allowing multi-pulse summation to retrieve the remaining sensitivity "loss". Hence, we expect that the rate of detection would be of the order of 6 targets/hour in this\nmode. However, this has to be established by experiment in Phase 2. Unfortunately, half of these targets\nwill be setting. Out of the three left, only one might come into the field-of-view\nof the laser. Therefore,\nmethods have to be sought to enhance the rate of detection.\nDetection\nfor such a scan:\n\nstatistics can be enhanced\n\nby conducting\n\na scan with the radar.\n\nThere are three modes\n\n1. A mechanical "bow-tie" scan of-20 beamwidths which can be essentially "leakproof"\nand will\ncover a 1\xc2\xb0 swath in azimuth. Since there is no requirement for the scan to be leak-proof, a larger\nscan can be employed if it is consistent with antenna dynamics.\n2. An electronic scan that can be imposed on the beam by building a phased-array "lens" into the\nhigh power beam path between the feed and the Cassegrainian subreflector. Such a capability was\ndesigned for the HAVE STARE but was never built. It is fairly expensive and also reduces the\nsensitivity by about 2 dB.\n3. An electronic scan that is generated by redesigning the high power feed as a small phased array.\nThis has the advantage of avoiding the sensitivity loss but is still a complex upgrade.\nIt is our recommendation\n\nthat the mechanical\n\nscan be tested in Phase 2. The other techniques\n\nare expen-\n\nsive (several million) and complex and shouM be resorted to only if the mechanical scan cannot satisfy the\nappetite of the laser. The gain in detection statistics to be expected increases at least linearly with the scan\nwidth and should be verified in Phase 2.\n6.4.2.\n\nPrecision\n\nTracking\n\nof Debris\n\nOnce a debris target is detected the radar has to initiate tracking in what is essentially\nfrom a \'stare" mode to a "chase" mode. This is a classic capability of most radars for detecting\njects with large radar cross-section. However, the chase operation for a debris with small RCS\nof interest to ORLON system is more challenging because the S/N ratio in the monopulse angle\nnot large. It is the signal in these channels over several pulses that enable the radar to determine\ntion and rate of movement and initiate a chase.\nThe HAX radar, collocated\n\nwith the Haystack\n\nradar has recently\n\ndeveloped\n\na transition\nspace obof the types\nchannels is\nthe direc-\n\na "stare-and-chase"\n\ncapability for debris targets. Since both Haystack and HAX share the same control system, the "stare-andchase" algorithms can be transitioned\nto Haystack with small modifications.\nWhile the Haystack radar does\nnot support the high angular rates of the HAX (see Table 6.1), we believe that it is still capable\n"stare-and-chase"\nmode. Again, this is amenable to test in Phase 2.\n122\n\nof the\n\nThe Haystack radar can track in four dimensions\ncurrent\n\nprecision\n\nin these dimensions\nElevation\nAzimuth\n\n- azimuth,\n\nelevation,\n\n10- 35 prad.\n((10 - 35 )/cos(elevation))\n\nrange and range\n\nrate.

This is certainly acceptable to the acquisition mode of the\nlaser, lf a smaller handover volume is required, near-real-time\nprocessing\nof the metric data is required\nwith a Kalman-type filter, along with better calibration techniques. These are available and amenable to\ntesting in Phase 2.\n6.4.3. Discrimination\nThis is probably\n\nthe most time-consuming\n\nand complex\n\ntask for the radar. The requirements\n\nare as\n\nfollows:\n1. Verify that the debris is in an ascending pass.\n2. Ascertain the catalog status of the debris in track.\n3. Ensure that the estimated size and, if required, dynamics\n\nof the debris are within the capability\n\nof the laser.\n4. Measure periodicities\nin the signature.\n5.

Guarantee that no airplane intercepts the laser beam during the engagement.\n6.4.3.1.\n\nCorrelation\n\nwith the Catalog\n\nThe monopulse data recorded during the transit of the debris through the beam is adequate to discern whether the target is in an ascending pass. If not, the search can be resumed. As soon as - 30 seconds\nof metric data (or -5 observations)\nare taken, an initial orbit can be estimated and checked to see if the\ndebris will be within the field-of-view\nof the laser for the required time interval during this apparition. If\nnot, the radar can return to its search scan. A correlation\n\nwith the catalog should be done next. The data\n\nquality is adequate to yield a good estimate of the orbit of the debris which can be checked against all the\nRSOs in the catalog. This task should take no more than 5 seconds with a modern work station and appropriate architecture of the software.\nIf it is a known large RSO, the search for debris can be resumed. If it is\na cataloged piece of debris, a real-time decision needs to be made based on the following:\nI. Is it of interest to the ORLON system - depending on strategy and size?\n2. Who nominally "owns" the cataloged debris? Does the ORION system have "permission"\nthe "owners" to irradiate their debris?\nGiven a positive\n\nanswer\n6.4.3.2.\n\nto both questions,\n\nfrom\n\nthe next step can be taken.\n\nRCS, Size and Dynamics\n\nAs the tracking of the debris piece continues, the radar must estimate the mean RCS and perhaps\nvariance.

In either case, if the target is monitored while being irradiated by the laser, the departure of the measured Doppler from prediction based on the pre-radiation\norbit is a clear and rapid indicator of laser effects. This technique is routinely applied at Lincoln radars for monitoring orbital maneuvers. However, it must be remembered that if the radar tracks the debris along with the laser, it cannot provide an advance guard to protect against inadvertent radiation of RSOs.\nContinued tracking of the debris post-radiation\nwill yield an estimate of the periodicity of the signature.

There is at least one available radar system that fits the requirements.\nA few issues and\nconcerns remain that can be answered with some study and experimentation.\n\n127\n\nAppendix\n6.1.1.\n\nHaystack\n\n6.1 : Description\n\nof Radars\n\nradar\n\nThis flagship of the radars built and operated by MIT Lincoln Laboratory is by far the\nmost sensitive satellite tracking radar available today. The only radars with higher sensitivity are Arecibo\nand Goldstone, both of which do not have the angular rate dynamics to support satellite tracking. Located\nin Tyngsboro, Massachusetts, this radar is part of the Lincoln Space Surveillance Complex and operates at\n10 GHz. with a 35 meter antenna. Its advantage is its high sensitivity. Its disadvantage is the relatively\nnorthern location which will preclude its effective tracking of debris in low inclinations.\nHaystack, HAX and Millstone Hill radars are part of the Lincoln Space Surveillance Complex\nlocated at --42.6 \xc2\xb0 North latitude. The preferred mode of operation cited in Chapter 6 for the Haystack radar\nis to point due South at 30 o elevation. The location and the pointing impose a restriction on the inclinations\nof the orbits o fthe debris that will be seen by the radar. Ifh is the altitude of the circular orbit, 0 is the\nlatitude of the site, cpthe minimum inclination of the orbit detectable at 300 elevation and R the radius fthe\nearth, then the relationship of these quantities is given by\nsin (600 - 0 - q_) = (R sin 020 \xc2\xb0) /(R+h)\nFigure 6.

Chief among\nthese is the Haystack radar whose data have begun to condition the debris models substantially. Collocated\nwith Haystack are the HAX and the Millstone hill radars both of which are tracking radars but with somewhat less sensitivity than Haystack. The description below of the characteristics of debris is derived largely\nfrom the participation of the Millstone hill radar in the debris campaigns run by AF Space Command.\nHence, the results are from a biased sample of debris with characteristic sizes larger than -5 cm.\nThe periodicities\nin the signatures of debris presumably equal to or a fraction of the spin period)\nrange from as low as 0. ! sec. to tens of seconds. There are inadequate statistics to assign a probability\nfunction to the spin period. All that can be stated at this point is that it would be invalid to assume that the\nthrust due to ablation caused by the interaction of the laser energy with the surface of the debris would be\nin the line-of-sight\ndirection on an average. This will be true only if the debris is irradiated over several\nspin periods at a rapid rate compared to the spin period.\nThe radar cross section of the debris particle\nas there are objects that seem to be brighter (and\nmicrowave frequencies.\nThe percentage of such\nit does not affect the functioning\nof the ORION\nthen the ORION system must employ an optical\nimportance of the laser as an acquisition system\n\n130\n\nis not always a clear indicator\n\nlarger) at optical wavelengths\nand\ndebris is an unknown at present.

The additional\n131\n\nfunctions noted above -- discrimination, assessment of effects, bookkeeping -- can be provided by an\noptical system. In particular a lxecision tr_ker operating on handover from the optical acquisition system\ncould providelarger\nangleposition\ninformationobetter\nt\nthanmicroradian\naccuracyfrom which good target\norbit\ninformation\ncould be deduced.

Target optical signature time history\nwould provide some good discrimination informalion. When illuminated by the Pusher Laser, the\nbackscatter and the radiation from a plasma could be sensed for additional information.\nFor optical acquisition, the most stressing of the targets optically is the smallest/dimmest\n-- a 1\ncm sized particle with a reflectivity (albedo) of 0.I. An optical system must be able to acquire and track\nthese targets at daily rates comparable to or greater than that achieved by a radar (Haystack) in order to be a\nviable alwxnafive. Haystack has demonstrated acquiring small targets at a rate of about 6 per hour,\nessentially at any time during the day. Haystack, in acquiring and tracking such targets, could provide track\ninformation to an accuracy of about 40 ttrad.

The active system would require an\nilluminating laser of a size similar to that of the Pusher Laser. Such a system has been considered and is\nreported elsewhere. Invoking such a major element to provide acquisition and tracking looked difficult so a\npassive system was also examined in some detail.\n7.4\n\nPassive\n\nOptical\n\nAcquisition\n\nPassive acquisition and tracking of (large) space objects in low altitude orbits can be accomplished\nwhen the objects are in terminator illumination around sunrise and sunset. Acquiring and tracking in the\nterminator mode means that the sky background is dark so that the dim target light doesn\'t have to compete\nwith sunlight scattered by the atmosphere.\nSuch acquisition has been routinely accomplished\nfor large\nobjects -- typically satellites or spacecraft -- and less routinely for small objects. The stressing target in\nthe ORION group of targets is quite dim corresponding\nto a star of visual magnitude around 18 or 19. This\nis not routine.\n\nThe anticipated operation of an autonomous passive optical acquisition system is "stare and chase."\nThe system will be pointed at a fixed position in the sky "staring" over its field of view with a fixed\nintegration time (frame rate).

The mount needs to be able to accelerate for the transition from "stare" to "chase"\nand to follow the target acceleration as it moves along its orbit. The transition acceleration\nwill dominate;\nan estimated few degrees/sec 2 should suffice to permit the telescope mount to catch up to the moving target\nwithin a fraction of a second and within an angle not much greater than the tracker field of view.

The dwell time of the array is set equal to the time it takes this\ntarget, at its range and zenith angle, to cross the pixel FOV represented on the abscissa. Since this target is\nthe dimmest in the set and at longest desired range, this figure represents the most stressing limit. Other\ntargets will be brighter and thus give a larger signal or be the same brightness but closer resulting\nstronger collected signal. In operation, the dwell time would be constant at a value corresponding\nmost stressing target and the specific pixel FOV for the focal plane.\n\nin a\nto that\n\nFigure 7.2 shows a number of curves. The number of photo-electrons\nfrom the target and from the\n(dark) background are shown as broken lines. A total noise standard deviation (sigma) is calculated from\nadding the variances of the background photon noise in electrons and the focal plane read noise (cr R = 10\nelectrons) and is shown as a dotted line. The solid line represents the S/N ratio:\nelectrons to the total noise standard deviation (sigma) also in photo-electrons.\n\nthe ratio of signal photo-\n\nAs indicated, the maximum signal-to-noise\nratio is about 2 for this most-stressing\ncase and occurs\nat a pixel FOV of about 20-60 Ixrad (with dwell times of about 8-25 msec). It is recognized that operation\nat this signal-to-noise\nratio is marginal.\nIt represents a probability of detection of 0.7 and a false alarm\nprobability of 0.1. (Adjusting the threshold to increase the probability of detection would also increase the\nprobability of false alarm.) However, it is anticipated that a fairly simple multiple hit track initiation\nalgorithm could be used to process multiple detections which would increase the probability of detection\nwithout increasing the probability of false alarm. Furthermore,\nthe target chosen is extremely dim (at the\nrange chosen it corresponds to about a 19th magnitude star) and an increase in brightness by only 50%\nwould increase the probability of detection to about 0.99 with no increase in false alarm probability for\nsingle pulse detection.\nIn Figure 7.3 is shown the same plots for a small target at an altitude of 1000 km with a range of\n1700 km at a zenith angle of 60*. The peak S/N ratio remains at about 2 since, while the range decreases,\nthe angular rate increases and the dwell time decreases.\nFigures 7.4 and 7.5 show the effects of zenith angle and background.\nAs can be seen in Figure\n7.4, the effects of zenith angle from 0 \xc2\xb0 to 60 \xc2\xb0 are not large giving good flexibility in locating targets as\nearly as possible.\nIn Figure 7.5 is shown the effect of full moonlit night on background\nwhich drops the\nsignal-to-noise\nratio by about a factor of 2 at the maximum of the signal-to-noise\ncurve. This is significant\nbut not overwhelming;\nsomewhat brighter targets than the most stressing would still be detected and\ntracked.\n7.4.2\n\nAcquisition\n\nRates\n\nThe current Lincoln\n\nLaboratory\n\nCCD focal plane referred\n\nto above is a 2500 x 2000 pixel array\n\nwith a pixel size of 25 Inn. Using this size directly for a 40 larad pixel FOV would imply, for a 3.5\ntelescope, an f/number of 0.15 -- quite impractical optically.\nHowever, if 12x 12 sub-arrays of these\nwere binned into a super-pixel,\nit would be 300 lain on a side and for a 40 grad super-pixel FOV, the\nsystem would be about f/\'2 -- much more practical.\nThis binning can take place on the chip so that\nread-out noise for a super-pixel remains at 10 electrons/read.\nWith 12x12 pixels per super-pixel, the\n\nm\np ixels\noptical\nthe\nwhole\n\narray would have 200x167 super-pixels.\nThe array FOV becomes 8 mrad x 6.67 mrad which is about 50\ntimes that of Haystack. The acquisition rate will depend upon the shape of the FOV and the distribution\nof\norbit angles but it will be at least 8 times that of Haystack thus essentially equalling (perhaps exceeding)\nthe number of targets acquired by Haystack per day.\n7.5.\n\nOperation\n\nof an\n\noptical\n\nacquisition\n\nsystem\n\nfor\n\nORION\n\nA concept of operations will be described in this section for the canonical optical system defined\nearlier to act as the "debris f\'mder" for the ORION laser.

The discrimination\ntask will take several minutes to complete and hence it\nis essential for the optical system to acquire the debris early in its apparition.\nHence, the optimum strategy\nis for the optical system to stare at -30 \xc2\xb0- 450 elevation.\nSince the optical system has a FOV of --0.5 \xc2\xb0, a\nscan is not needed though a "step-stare" scan could be used. The stare will keep the stars invariant in the\nFOV. The choice of azimuth is dictated by the location of the optical system and the inclinations of the\norbits that are of prime interest. Since most of the debris are in high inclination orbits, a optical system on\nor near the equator could point due north or south at 30 o elevation for detection.\nIf however, the optical\nsystem is located in say New Mexico, at 32 o north latitude, pointing\nimproves the inclination coverage significantly\n(see Appendix 6.1).\n\ndue south is recommended\n\nas it\n\nThe optical system should detect an average of 40 - 60 debris targets/hour between the altitudes of\n500 Km. and 1500 Kin. However, this has to be established by experiment in Phase 2. Unfortunately,\nhalf\nof these targets will be setting. Out of those left, only 1/3 might come into the field-of-view\nof the laser.\nIf a higher detection rate is desired, the optical system could conduct a "step-stare" scan.\n7.5.2.\n\n_\'ansition\ndeveloped\n\nPrecision\n\nTracking\n\nof\n\nDebris\n\nOnce a debris target is detected the optical system has to initiate tracking in what is essentially\nfrom a \'stare" mode to a "chase" mode.

This could\n\nbe accomplished\nby a separate optical tracker (passive or active) with appropriately\nsized detectors or focal\nplane arrays so that the overall field of view is sufficient to accept handover from the acquisition system\n(with its wacking jitter/accuracy)\nand sufficient resolution to achieve the required precision tracking\naccuracy.\nIndeed, with the focal plane array used in the acquisition system as described above, it may be\nquite feasible to reconfigure\nthe focal plane array while still in acquisition track to utilize the much smaller\npixels (non-super-pixels).\nThese might have a pixel field of view in the few larad region and would afford\nthe required precision tracking required..\n7.5.3.\n\nDiscrimination\n\nThis is probably the most time-consuming\n\nand complex\n\nrequirements are as follows:\n1.

If not, the search can be resumed. As soon as - 75 seconds of metric\ndata (or -15 observations) are taken, an initial orbit can be estimated and checked to see if the debris will be\nwithin the field-of-view\nof the laser for the required time interval during this apparition. If not, the optical\nsystem can re_urn to its search. A correlation with the catalog should be done next. The data quality is\nadequate to yield a good estimate of the orbital plane of the debris and of its position in space, both of\nwhich can be checked against all the RSOs in the catalog. This task should take no more than 5 seconds\nwith a modern work station and appropriate architecture of the software.\nIf it is a known large RSO, the\nsearch for debris can be resumed. If it is a cataloged piece of debris, a real-time decision needs to be made\nbased on the following:\n1. Is it of interest to the ORION\n\nsystem - depending\n\n2. Who nominally "owns" the cataloged\nthe "owners" to irradiate their debris?\nGiven a positive\n\nanswer\n\nto both questions,\n\n7.5.3.2.\n\nSize\n\nand\n\ndebris?\n\non strategy and size?\n\nDoes the ORION\n\nsystem have "permission"\n\nfrom\n\nthe next step can be taken.\nDynamics\n\nAs the tracking of the debris piece continues,\n\nthe optical\n\nsystem must estimate\n\nthe mean size and\n\nperhaps a variance. The size can be approximately estimated using an average photometric phase model for\ndebris. There is considerable doubt about the "average" value for albedo to be used which directly affects the\nestimate of size. It is recommended\nthat, during Phase 2, a large sample of debris be examined with\nparticular bias towards the denser population regions to assess an average albedo. Techniques for decoupling\nthe area and albedo have been developed _. The signature data must also be analyzed through the mechanics\nof algorithms like auto-correlation\nor Fourier transform to determine any periodicities.\nThe estimation of\nsize is significantly affected by periodicity in the signature and, further, debris are known to have\nperiodicities\nranging from -4). 1 sec. to >>30 see.\nThe value of estimated periodicity in the signature lies in the fact that it will be significantly\naffected by the impact of the laser energy and, hence, it can be used as an indicator of the success of the\nengagement.\nThe inferred size of the debris must be compared to a threshold set for the ORION system to decide\non the engagement.\nThe periodicity may prove useful for the same purpose.\n7.5.3.3.\n\ndamaging\n\nInadvertent\n\nIllumination\n\nof\n\nRSOs\n\nA major concern with the ORLON system is its potential for inadvertently\na payload in orbit. This concern is motivated by both treaty implications\n\nilluminating and\nand the cost of\n\n"pienaty_e".\nOnce the debris has passed the t-dters in the previous sections and deemed suitable for engagement\nby the ORION system, a detailed prediction needs to be made of the part of the trajectory that the laser\nwould illuminate.\nThis prediction has to be compared with the known position of the entire catalog of\npayloads to guarantee that inadvertent illumination does not occur.

A visible\nwavelength\noptical system, if collocated with the laser, can measure this effect. The flash will clearly\nindicate that the target has been hit. It is unknown whether the plasma will be quenched rapidly enough\nsuch that the interaction due to each pulse can be monitored.\nThe Doppler of a target can be measured very precisely by a coherent laser. Also, depending on the\naccuracy of the track, Doppler can be infened from range measurements.\nIn either case, if the target is\nmonitored while being irradiated by the laser, the departure of the measured Doppler from prediction based\non the lyre-radiation orbit is a clear and rapid indicator of laser effects.

For a 5-m mirror looking at an\nR--0.3, 1.5-cm target, Dbd_/R -- 4 is the correct line to follow. Then, a 10-km spot size for a target at\n1500 km would return only 0.004 photons per kJ, that is, a 2.5-MJ pulse at the ground would be\nnecessary\nto get a 10-photon\nreturn!\nMore realistically,\nif we use a 6-m mirror, W = 30kJ and 4-km spot size in the longer-term\nsystem\n[for 2-year sky search time], then at R = 0.3, a debris target must be 4.5 cm in size to return 10\nphotons.\nCalculations\n\nsuch as this have\n\nbeen discouraging\n\nin the past.\n\nNow. imagine that we have two mirrors - closely colocated\n- a small one with high quality\ntransmit and receive, and a much larger, very low quality mirror surrounding\nthat to receive\nreturned photons, to take the place of the radar system.\n224\nExcellence in photonics at affordable rates\n\nto\nthe\n\nFigure 5: Average\nLaser Power Required\nto Receive\n10 photons per shot and Search Sky in 2\nyears shows the average power P = f2*W required to meet thes criteria simultaneously,\nvs. target\naltitude.

However,\nfor CW acquisition,\nwe can see that more received photons\nare required compared\nto the pulsed illumination\ncase, since the target is moving and it is a streak that\nwe must create rather than just a dot on the focal plane array.\nThe spot size ds can be read off Figure 4, where it is seen that a search spot of order 4km is correct to\nget back 10 photons from a 30-10 pulse. For the CW case, the target moves 77m per 10ms interval,\nduring which the 3MW laser will also deposit 30kJ. If a 1000xl000-pixel\nmatrix is imaging a 4-km\nspot at range, the target streak will be 20 pixels long, and 20 times as much illumination\nis required to\nprovide detection\nas in the pulsed laser case. The CW laser certainly\nmeets this requirement\nwith 100\ntimes more photons.\nHowever,\nthere are concerns\nwith thermal blooming,\nbeam quality and target\ninteraction.\nWe will not analyze this case further in this memo.\nAverage\n\npower\n\nP is independent\n\nof search\n\nspot size ds.

Of these,\ninvolves the use of a holographic\ngrating pair to passively compress a so-called "chirped"\nlarge\nbandwidth\npulse of about l0 ns duration.\nThe second compression\nmethod uses the physics of\nStimulated\nBrillouin Scattering\n(SBS), Stimulated\nRaman Scattering\n(SRS) or both in a cascade\nprovide passive compression.\nThe third method is the "brute force"\namplifier of adequate bandwidth.\n\nPULSES\n\nand amplify\n\none\n\nto\n\nit in an\n\nGratings\n\nThe beauty of this technique\nis its nearly perfect energy convesion\nefficiency\n(in principle).\nHowever,\nthe difficulty\nis that these gratings are limited to about 1 meter in transverse\ndimension by current\ntechnology.\nInspection\nof the figure above will show that the chriped input pulse to the grating must\n\nNeodymium\nlaser\n10-ns pulse duration\nwith chirped output\n\n_\n-_ _\n._1--[_\n\n"bluer"\nfollows\nholo\n\n"redder"\nfollows\n\nportion bends\nlonger path\nportion\nshorter\n\nless,\n\nbends more,\n\nOutput\n\npath\n\nthen be not much longer than 3 ns, due to the finite\'speed\nof light.

SBS/SRS\n\nCascade\n\ninput\n\nSBS\ne.g.\n\nmedium\nbenzene\n\nr\nThe advantage\nof this technique\nis its simplicity and totally passive operation in shortening\na long input\npulse, by as much as a factor of 10. The pulse reshaping\nthat results is due to strong satruation\nof the\ninput or pump wave by the leading oedge of the counterpropagating\noutput or "Stokes"\nwave. A similar\ndiagram describes\nthe behavior\nof a reverse SRS pulse compressor.\nSBS and SRS units can be used in\ncascade to obtain certain desirable effects.\nTotal compression\nratios of about 100 have been obtained, just about what we require in the ORION\nsystem (efficient conversion\nto 100 ps pulses which couple efficiently\nto the debris target, from cheap,\nrelatively\nlow energy 10 ns inputs).\nThe problem with this technique\nis: low efficiency.\nCompression\nratios of 100 go along\nefficiency\nwhich may be as low as 2%, unacceptable\nfor ORION. Such a low efficiency\nmake it less expensive\nto build and use a higher energy long pulse laser.\n3.

It also depends, at the present time, on unattainable\ncombinations\nof laser parameters.\nThe problem is that the brightness\nintegral or "B-integral"\nwhich determines\nbeam\nbreakup due to nonlinear refraction\nin the glass host of a solid state laser system is the same integral,\napart from constants,\nthat determines\nenergy extraction\nefficiency.\nAnd, for 100-ps pulses, the result is\nthat efficient extraction\nis not yet possible for lOOps pulses if high beam quality is also required.\nThe consequence\nof all this is: At this time, the best choice is a 5 or 10 ns pulse\npulse is generated by a solid state laser system. The situation may well improve\nas efforts at solid state laser R&D labs proceed.\n\nfor ORION, if that\nin the next year or two\n\n245\n\nTOPIC 13" FINAL\nLatest\n\ninfo\n\nORION\n\nindicates\n\n5 to\n\n1.

The Strehl ratio S accounts\nfor non-ideal propagation effects such as turbulence, and can be much less than unity in practice.\nSince most of the space debris of interest for mitigation by ORION is at altitudes from 800 to 1200 km, laser\nspot sizes of at least 20 cm (and perhaps much larger) can be expected even with short wavelength (1.06p\nfor Nd:Glass lasers) and with beam directors approaching the size of today\'s largest astronomical\ntelescopes. While these relatively large sizes exact a toll from the pusher lasers in view of the required\noutput power, it will be shown that they, together with the short wavelengths and large apertures that are\nneeded to achieve them, are nevertheless very costly in terms of both turbulence compensation and the\nassociated sub-microradian pointing accuracy, and a more complete optimization at the system level might\nyet recommend operation with even larger spot sizes.\n\n_c\n\nTurbulence and Adaptive Ootics\n\nAside from nonlinear propagation effects that can normally be avoided by reducing peak intensity levels, the\nmajor contributor to non-ideel beam spread and loss of Strehl ratio is atmospheric turbulence (see the figure\non the next page) which disrupts the beam by superimposing regions of varying refractive index (much like\nlenses.) Turbulence effects both telescope images and transmitted laser beams by reducing the coherence\nand scattering the light with short correlation scales (often reducing the effective aperture size from the full\none D to a much smaller Fried scale r0), whereas large scales tend to tilt the wavefront and steer the light.\nAdaptive optics attempt to counter these effects by measuring the distortion of a reference wavefront\ntraversing the path and introducing the conjugate (opposite) distortion in the primary wavefront. The source\nfor the reference wavefront can be, for example, a natural star, reflection from an object (like a target), or\nemission from a laser beacon projected from the ground. Turbulence of course varies both spatially and\ntemporally, so correlation between the two wavefronts will be lost ever increasingly large scales as any\ntransverse displacement of their axes is increased, an effect usually refewed to as anisoplanatism. The\ndegree of correction improves as the size d of the control zones is decreased, and d = ro generally\nrepresents a useful cost-effective compromise. Such correction can be achieved with state-of-the-art\nsegmented and/or deformable adaptive optics systems, but it should be realized that many thousands of\nelements will be required for the large apertures of interest for ORION - and costs for such systems\n255\n\nd0,m\nlO\n\nro, m\nC\n\nWavelngth )., p\n\n10\n\n100\n\n1\n\ne,, r.\'ad\n10\n\n10\n\n10o\n\n\'\n\nt\n/.\n\n1.O\n\n/Yi\n\n/_--_-;-_ ...........\n\n;Yi\n\nco , l, s/,\n\n\'f\n\n"/\n\nI/7\n\n"" i,\n\n-" Ji\n\ni ..........\n\n0.2S\n1\n\nr_\n\n0.75\n\n7.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n\',\n\n1.0\n\no.=.\n\n" 7\n\n0.50\n\n/\n\n/\n\nOT "_.IIP"\n\n0.76\n\ni\n\ni\n\ndoS_\nI\n\n0.26\n\no\n\ncontinue to be at least about $1000 per channel (although $200-$250 per channel is recommended for use\nas an eventual goal.)\nSeveral typical distributions of atmospheric turbulence are\nshown at the right, and their effects on propagation are given in\nthe nomograrn. Turbulence always tends to be very high near\nthe surface due to the Earth\'s boundary layer (dominating the\ncontribution to ro), but locally-severe conditions can arise at\nhigher altitudes due to wind shear. High tropospheric winds in\nparticular often lead to pronounced turbulence at upper\naltitudes, and, although the resulting strength is such that they\ncontribute little to r0 itself, their distance from the aperture can\ncause important coherence losses between paths that diverge\nfrom the aperture.\n\nl\nol\n\ni\n\nThe latter effect is especially important for propagation to space\n\nI\n\n"_\'_--\n\n_oe\n\nto"\n\nto"\n\nl_\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2 =\'_\nlo"\n\nT,,=.,==,,_c.,, ,,-\n\nbecause the "isoplanatic" angle over which coherence is Ixese_ed is usually much less than both the angle\nbetween the target and a sufficiently-bright\nnatural star beacon (typically spaced several hundred\nmicroradians) and the lead-ahead angle 2v/c cos0 required to account for the distance that the target moves\nin the round-trip transit time for light between the ground system and the target.

The tilt anisoplanatism is no more than (0.00410)(13.5) = 0.055 i_rad in that case, so image\nmotion will be small compared to the diffraction size. Matters, however, can become considerably more\ncomplicated when correction must be made for a laser beam targeted against a rapidly-moving distant\nobject.\n\n_dJurn\n\n3.5\n\nThe high-altitude turbulence that most contributes to isoplanatic problems limits the\neffectiveness of the beacon as well because the solid angle from the beacon to the\naperture does not account for all of the turbulence along the full path, even with a\nsodium beacon which, at 92 km altitude, is the highest artificial one that has been\nidentified. This effect, commonly referred to as focus anisoplanatism, leads to the\nconcept of a "beacon coverage size" do that defines the largest aperture that can be\ncovered by a single beacon (a few meters at typical conditions.) Altematively, it\nalso can be used to determine the number of beacons N = (D/do)" that would be\nneeded for a large aperture, but each such beacon must be =tagged" to differentiate\nits wavefront from the others, and the multiple signals must then be "stitched"\nproperly to produce the proper final wavefront. Unfortunately, the ability to actually\nuse multiple beacons has lagged the theory, and there have been no truly\nsuccessful demonstrations at this time. Until then, although there appear to be no\nfundamental reasons why multiple beacons cannot be applied, the use of an\naperture larger than that which can be handled with a single beacon should be\nregarded for now as a very risky proposition.\n\nm\n\nThe status of a number of adaptive optics systems as of 1/94 is reviewed in the table on the next page.\n\n_rK]aoement\n\nProfile\n\nO,Jx=\nP_\n\nsystem, and serves to identify\n\n146\n\n219\n\n0\n\nRr_ _l_*\n\nAW_r*\n\nA\n\n..\n",\n:\ni\n,,\n\n93\n\nPu_\n\nThe engagement profile at the\nright shows some important\ncharactedstics of the ORLON\n\nn_, Q 1000 I=m\nNIIlude, seconds\n\n-,=\n""\n\n\xc2\xa2\n,\'\n"\n\n"\n\n,\n\n\'KaI_X\nm.mp-\n\n/. f\n\nJ\n\n/\n\nseveral\nas-yet\nunresolved\nissues.\nTimes and angular\nrates are specified for a 1000\nkm debris altitude, but the\nresults can easily be scaled to\nother altitudes.\n\nT,._\n_\n\n:_\n:=\'m_d\n,_\nI\n0._sc_>_=\n0_\n:\n_\n\n,\'\n,\'\n/\n\n,\'\n\n.."\n/ _\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n(.t,,_,,,_/_\nJ._=_._"\n\n@\'_0o0_ .J _\n.0_""\n\nThe target will typically be\n:: //,o"\ns,,m=_,=,_,-_=,,,,_v,_m\nengaged at about 60 _ from\n;:..-\'\n"J_"\nzenith (30 \xc2\xb0 above the horizon)\nbecause R" and atmospheric losses rapidly increase beyond there. Passive optical acquisition with one or\nmore simple wide-FOV telescopes, limited by uncorrected turbulence to about 10 i_rad resolution, appears\nto be a very viable option for ORION, and a relatively long time (93 sec (_ 1000 km) is available for the\nacquisition system to establish track and to ensure that the target is in fact debds before possibly switching\nto fine track at about 45 \xc2\xb0.

SPIE OE Reports (Jan 1994)\n\n13\n12W\nLGS\n50W\nLGS\n\nThe problem here is the need for "Kentucky Windage", the lead-ahead required to account for the distance\ntraveled by the target during the elapsed time for a signal from the target to arrive at the sensor, be\nprocessed for adaptive optics correction, and then for the laser beam to retum to the target. This is not a\nmeasured quantity, but, rather, must be calculated and established by dead reckoning over tens of\nmicroradians to an accuracy of the size of the laser spot (about two orders of magnitude smaller.) Unlike a\nduck hunter who is smart enough to use a shotgun instead of a rifle to shoot a fast-moving bird, the slowly\npulsed pusher laser wants to act like a rifle, and the relative size of the lead-ahead will make it very difficult\nfor a tracking system (active or passive) to provide the required accuracy by dead-reckoning regardless of\nthe certainty of orbital motion - especially when the laser "rifle" is being moved about by turbulence.\nThough typically only a few milliseconds_300tl_e\ndistances are far greater than target dimensions, and the leadahead angle 2V/c cose (42.4 p.rad at\nand 1000 km altitude) is generally so much larger than the\nisopianatic angle that the signal from the target will be useless as a beacon for the adaptive optics. A\ndedicated laser guidestar within the isoplanatic angle about the outgoing path (i.e., "leading" the target) will\ntherefore be essential for reducing the beam spread, but less direct, however, is the means for handling\nturbulence-induced tilt because the guidestar signal is itself steered by turbulence. The debris objects of\ninterest tend to be smaller than the beam size, and we have already shown for the case being considered\nthat the RMS tilt angle greatly exceeds the ideal diffraction angle (by a factor of over 20), so the probability\nof hitting the target will be extremely low if we do not accurately measure or predict the tilt.\nThe most attractive option for doing so appears to be to use the target itself as a reference for tilt, accurately\nbiasing the track and tilt data to account for the lead angle, and that should be possible because of the\nrelatively invariant nature of orbital flight. However, it should be realized that the combination of tilt\nanisopianatism and the need for highly accurate tracking data will require that the pusher beam and the\noptical signals from the target and the guideetar all be shared by the same aperture - a non-trivial hardware\nproblem -- because of the pronounced degradation that would otherwise result from strong low-altitude\nturbulence. Both the pusher beam and the target tracker must use adaptive optics to minimize spread, and\ntheir corrections will necessarily be different because\nT/UqGET\n\ntheir angular separation considerably exceeds the\nisoplanatic angle (let alone the fact that their wavelengths\nmay be different.) All of the wavefronts will essentially tilt\ntogether at a characteristic frequency VT/D ,= 10 Hz for\nthe given conditions, so the tracking data must be rapidly\nprocessed in view of the need for accuracy to a small\nfraction of the large overall excursion of the tilt The\nsmall time slices required for gathering the tracking data\nand the need to closely synchronize it with the pusher\nbeam strongly\nsuggest that the target\ntracking\nillumination be provided by either a CW or very-rapidlyrepped laser, probably operating at yet another\nwavelength to ease the difficulties of aperture-sharing. A\nsuggested functional block diagram of the system is\nshown at the right to illustrate the key components and\ninformation flow. The first splitter is the only high intensity\nshared component beyond the basic telescope/director.\nNeither the beacon nor the illuminator laser need, of\n\n-,\n\nmm\n\nm\nm\n\n_ _ ._ _\neco_ :croR\n\'\n_ _ .,_ ,_\no SENSOR\noco_\nI _ _\n\ne s_eoR\n\nI\n\ncourse, be co-located with the pusher/sensor system.\nShould extrapolation of the tracking data not provide sufficiently accuracy, it may be necessary to follow the\napproach of the duck hunter by broadening the beam considerably (i.e., to use a "shotgun" and to accept the\ngreatly decreased intensity) and/or to share the main aperture with a boresighted scanning laser (a CW or\nrapidly pulsed "machine gun\') that can be continually steered to maximize return from the target.\nRegardless of the approach, the complications involved in boresighting with a high energy pulsed taser\ncould prove to be so daunting that it might be worth considering the use of a far more powerful and rapidlysteered CW or highly-napped pusher laser to overcome both the lead-ahead and aperture tilt problems,\nprobably eliminating the need for a fine tracker at the same time.\n259\n\n2.

The 27M$ total cost of\nthe latter included 10.5M$ for the Corttmves USA optical mount and 7M$ for the primary mirror from the\nUniversity of Arizona\'s Steward Observatory Mirror Laboratory. The very moderate telescope cost is due in\nlarge part to the use of a 4500 lb. monolithic primary mirror that broke from tradition by using a thin spuncast borosilicate facsplate with computer-controlled actuators to compensate for deformations of the\nhoneycomb sandwich base. Other unique features include a complete closed-cycle water heater/chiller\nsystem for precise themml control and a protective enclosure composed of three 9 ft. high, 70 ft. diameter\ncylinders that collapse around the telescope to provide complete ventilation and an unobstructed view for\nhigh-speed satellite tracking. Both systems are designed to monitor a variety of space objects, and their\nslew rates (18.3 deg/sec in azimuth and 4.75 deg/sec in elevation) are sufficient to track even very lowaltitude targets. They will eventually incorporate deformable adaptive optics at the end of the F/200 Coude\npaths to provide the desired resolution, but delivery of the 3.55M$ 200W sodium guide star from LLNL for\nSOR has been delayed by AF budget reallocation. The systems are specifically designed for imaging, and,\nas a minimum, the present silver-coated optics throughout the Coude path would probably have to be\nreplaced for high-power operation. A 12 in. 5 mrad full FOV scope with an intensified camera is available\nfor acquisition. The SOR site is located near the end of the runway of the Albuquerque IntemaUonel Airport,\nand FAA approval is required for individual shots.\n\n260\n\n10M Keck Telescopes\n\n_0=_..=__\n\n_o_=m_ow=\n\n........................ \xe2\x80\xa2\n__\n\n_.,..d_\n\n....\n\n__\n\nKeck I1: O_\n\nP,rimery\nmppo_\n\n_\n\nDrive & oonO\'ol\n\notx.m_o_deVo\nSUl_\n\nflldmes\n\nM=npolr\nKed\xc2\xa2 I"\n__\n\n_\n\n--\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\n21 MS\n4\n..\n\n2\n\nS\n13\n\n_M=\n93M$\n\nDome\n\n10\n\n......\n\nEventually expected to operate as an interferorneter, the two 10 meter Keck astronomical telescopes on\nMauna Kea in Hawaii are the largest in the world, and they again broke with conventional design tradition by\neach employing an array of 36 hexagonal mirror segments, each in turn actively supported on three\nwhiffletrees with computer-controlled actuators to control distortion. The required overall parabolic figure\nwas obtained by precisely pre-stressing each of the mirror blanks, polishing them to a sphedcal curvature,\nand then allowing them to relax to the final shape. The overall weight of the Keck telescope is 596,000 Ibs,\nabout half that of the 5 meter Hale telescope, and about three times that of the Starfire telescope (186,000\nIbs.) Subsystem costs are shown in the figure, and it is quite significant that they are only about three times\nthose of the Starfire telescope. A 349-element deformable mirror from XJnetics will be available soon to\nprovide infrared turbulence correction (note that d = DI_/N = 54 cm is much larger than typical values of r0 in\nthe visible.) Although designed exclusively for astronomical observations, it is interesting to note that their\nmaximum design slew rate of 3 deg/sec ("anywhere to anywhere in under 2 minutes\') would be sufficient for\nthe needs of ORION.\n\nHiqh-Pow_" Beam Director\nNo high-power beam directors of ORION size exist in the Wastem world. The telescopes described above\nare designed for imaging, not for beam directing, and their optical designs attest to that fact. The large\nprimary mirrors themselves do not pose a sedous problem because the flux levels on them tend to be quite\nlow (e.g., 10 MW on a 10 meter mirror corresponds to only 0.13 Wlcm 2 - one solar flux - at 1% absorption),\nbut the smaller mirrors in the Coude path are typically subjected to 100 times or more intensity, and that will\ngenerally require more damage-resistant coatings and actively-cooled substrates.\nThe most vulnerable\nelements generally tend to be those associated with the adaptive optics system, e.g. the high-power beam\nsplitter for the wavefront sensor, and the active mirror itself (if it is in fact situated in the Coude path.)\nNonlinear beam propagation becomes a major issue as well within a telescope pdmadly because of the high\nintensities in the Coude path, and a high power beam director will usually employ beam conditioning using a\nsealed optical system with a low absorbing flowing gas, and that in turn will require transmitting windows to\nisolate the gas from the surroundings.\nThese _ould represent rather extensive changes of the existing systems (which, of course, are dedicated to\napplications that don\'t need those mods), and a concept that might be suitable for a large beam director to\nmeet the requirements of the ORION mission is the coelostat shown on the next page. This design was\nspecifically configured to use the PAMELA segmented primary mirror concept which permits r0-sized\nadaptive optic elements instead of ones reduced by the telescope magnification ratio to a few millimeters,\nand places them on a rigid base to minimize control-structure interactions and to allow active cooling if\n201\n\nr_e_,\n\nThe r_d _\n\n_\n\n_ov_\n\nst_lHy, _k_s\n\n_ady _\n\nth_ho_\n\nfor U_r_\n\nand\n\neleotro-mechwlical control, and enables the use of an active secondary for additional correction. The\nsealed rotating housing with a verticelly-mounted window protects all of the high-value components and\nprovides a controlled environment for the high intef1_ty\nlaser path. The most argumentative (dements of the\ndesign are the two massive 450 mirrors, but they execute rather sdmple motion, and can be of very\nlightweight design with active figure correction via the adaptive optics.\n\nCoat\nThe optics represent the moa fundamental unit of any telescope or beam director, and scaling philosophy in\nthe business places a premium on their total mass by assuming that other system and subsystem weights\nand costs are ell linearly proportional to it for s/re,far systems. Such scaling has little firm basis in\nengineering or science, but, rather, it is based on good design practice wherein improvements in one\ncomponent tend to be mirrored in others because of both competition and cost-effectiveness (because\nrelative Improvements in a minor component would better be made in a major one.). An accepted rule with\nastronomical telescopes is, in fact, that the cost of the total telescope and mount is about twice that of the\noptics, and the total facility is about twice the telescope. Both the Keck and the Starfire systems fit this\nguideline quite well with regard to cost, but the agreement may be somewhat fortuitous in view of the\ndisparities in telescope mass and mirror cost. The high slew rates of the Starfire telescope resulted in a\nmuch heavier telescope relative to the primary\n10\'\nmirror, but its lightweight mirror was relatively\nexpensive, it is thought, due to recovery of coats\n\xe2\x80\xa2\nK_R\nfor spin casting development.\nNot to be\n\xe2\x80\xa2\nCalven.on_ So_\ne=\ne\'"\ndiscounted, too, is the fact that another major\nI0\'\n\xe2\x80\xa2\nSona._\nfactor in any such system is the cost of high-tech\nOil\n..\nsupport, and Starflm\'s dedicated Air Force\nC.orWou_\n\xe2\x80\xa2 ,a"Si_rare/\npersonnel and Keck\'s university support probably\n10\'\nhad major impact on the very moderate overall\ncosts.\nThe problems associated with simple power-law\nscaling am shown at the right where mass is\nplotted for a large number of mirrors of various\ntypes of design. The Keck and Starflm minors\nthemselves actually follow conventional D2.e\nscaling, but they represent lower extremes of\nwidely scattered data, the dispersion of which can\nproduce huge numedcel differences at such large\nsizes.\nThose differences represent a major\n\nlo\'\n\n10\n\n1\nI0\nMi_r _,\n\n262\n\nM\n\nsystem technology and design ddver because high values can simply not be afforded, and paradigm shifts\nhave to be made. In the interest of cost realism. As a result, the overall cost of the Keck scales almost\nlinearly with D from Starfire, and a major change like the coelostat concept might perhaps be the next step\nthat would have to be taken with radical redesign for a much larger telescope.\nEconomic realism dictates that means be found to continue such a scaling trend.\n\n3.\n\nHigh-Energy Lasers\n\nThe choice of available lasers for the ORION mission is really quite limited because of the need to produce\na beam of high energy pulses at a high duty cycle on a regular basis for long periods of time and to\npropagate that energy through the atmosphere to a very small spot at long ranges in space.\nThe CO2 laser was the first to operate in a very high power mode, and its lower power versions today set the\nstandard for high reliability in the industrial world, but the 10 - 11rp wavelength is prevented by diffraction\nfrom producing the target energy density needed for ORION.\nAnother system that has attracted\nconsiderable commercial interest, partly because of its ability to actually break the chemical bonds of the\nmaterial that it interacts with, is the excimer laser which operates at the other end of the wavelength\nspectrum in the ultraviolet and short IJV; the potentially high single-pulse energy and small spot size has\nalso caused considerable interest for use as a space-based laser weapon, 10ut he available parameter range\nt\nof pulse energy, pulse length, and rep rate don\'t mate wall with the ORION requirements, and the short\nwavelengths greatly complicate the use of adaptive optics for turbulence correction. Similar arguments\npertain to most of the other high energy laser systems that have been developed for military and/or\nindustrial use (e.g., iodine @ 1.3rp, HF/DF @ 2.7 - 3.8rp, and CO @ 4.8 - 6rp), the result being that the only\nremaining viable candidates appear to be the neodymium glass and free electron lasers.\nSolid state neodymium glass lasers are widely used for inertial confinement fusion programs because of\ntheir ability to produce high energy in relatively short pulses at short wavelength - 1.06rp, but readily\ndoubled and tripled for operation in the visible. Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory has led this\ncountry in the development of such lasers through the massive Shiva, Nova, and soon-to-be NIF (National\nIgnition Facility) systems, and their currently-operating Beamlet laser with its 20 kJ, tens of nanosecond\npulses may be uniquely suited to the ORION mission if the system can be cooled for operation in a\nrepetitively pulsed mode. A major benefit of the concentrated R&D that has gone into those systems is the\navailability of specialized hardware for such functions as frequency doubling, beam isolation, and cleanup, a\nnotable example of the latter being the SBS (stimulated Bdllouin scattering) mirror that has been used at\nLLNL to generate a phase conjugated beam for real-time cancellation of thermal distortions. Caution is\nsimply advised that these lasers are very expensive, and their present location in the heart of California\'s\nheavily-populated Uvermore Valley is less than ideal from every viewpoint for ORLON. Nevertheless, LLNL\nhas performed ground-to-space propagation from there, and they have - or could soon have - the\ncapabilities on site to vividly demonstrate the debris clearing concept.\nThe free electron laser remains a candidate for ORION because of the advantages offered by its wide\noperational parameter space (including wavelength), potentially high efficiency with electron beam recovery,\nand excellent beam quality, but it also represents one of the most dramatic failures of the DoD high energy\nlaser program in terms of dollars spent per kilowatt output. It has, however, been pursued far mere\nsuccessfully in the former Soviet Union, and it and other systems developed there might prove more\nsuitable for orbital debris removal than would their US counterparts if certain biases by our government and\nits industrial partners can be overcome. The most serious technical question involving the use of an FEL for\ndebris clearing is its ability to actually produce the desired target interaction: for example, a 200 kW FEL\n(e.g., the Microtron RF system proposed for near-term delivery to the U.S. by the Budker Institute in\nNovosibirsk) operates at about 20 MHz with about 20 psec pulses, and, regardless of the details of the\nmacropulse format, this corresponds to no more than tens of millijoules of energy per pulse whereas target\ncoupling requires at least tens of joules at that pulse duration.\n263\n\nThebenefits a well-corrected\nof\nlargeaperture\nbeamdirectororORLON\nf\ncannot eunderstatedecause\nb\nb\nof\ntheprofound\neffectof the resulting small spot size on the laser system itself. A 10 cm spot on a target at a\nrange of 2500 km, about the most that would be necessary to deorbit the largest concentration of orbital\ndebris, would require an effective aperture size DVS of 32 meters at l rp wavelength. This is ciearly far\nbeyond even the largest optical astronomical telescopes being considered today and it would require a\npointing accuracy of at least 30 nanoradians, but such sizes are relatively routine with radio telescopes, the\nsegmented optics technology exists today to populate such structures for operation at optical frequencies,\nand the pointing accuracies are similar to those pursued for the Strategic Defense Initiative. Instead of the\ntens of Idlojoules/pulse that might be required with a more conventional telescope, the desired effect could\nbe obtained with less than 1 kJ pulses from a 50 nsec laser, and this corresponds to the pulse parameters of\nthe 20 MW induction FEL (I kJ pulses @ 20 kHz) that was the eady baseline for the SELENE system and for\nwhich the solid-state accelerator modules are already in operation at Science Research Laboratory in\nSomerville MA. Note that the 20 MW figure is for compadson only, and an operational ORION system\nusing either an FEL or a glass laser could operate at far smaller PRF and power level with those kJ pulses.\nFor near-term use, that same beam director operating against a target at 500 km would produce only a 2.5\ncm spot, but the same impulse could be obtained with only a few tens of joules par pulse.\n\n4.\n\nSpace Debris Removal - Orbital Considerations\n\nSpace debris can be deorbited by using a ground-based laser to selectively apply a velocity increment to\nincrease ellipticlty and/or to decrease energy. The reduced perigee altitude in either case will then result in\nincreased drag and more rapid destructive re-entry. The orbitallresntry aspects of the problem are fully\ntreated here, emphasizing physical understanding of the behavior rather than actual numerics. A simple\nexpression for the time required by atmosph_c drag to cause reentry from an arbitrary orbit is first\ndeveloped, and the impulsive Av requirements are then defined for most effectively producing reentry.\nOrbital Mechani_\nThe t_o-body orbit problem, including drag D, is described by the equations\nRad/a/force:\nand\n\n-.\n\n&V\n\n_rldt z = dv#dt = Ve21r-_r 2 - D/m cos_\n\nAngular momentum H.\n\nd(rve)/dt = - Drlm sin\xc2\xa5,\n\nwhich may be combined to give\nD\nEnergy\n\nE:\n\nd[(Vr2 +\n\nVe2)/2\n\n-\n\nldr]/dt : - Dvrlm\n\nand\n\nd2(l/r)ld02 = !_-I 2 - l/r.\n\nIt follows that the orbital parameters in vacuum (i.e., with D - 0) are given by\nE=\n\n_--(\n\n)\'\n\n,7==\n\n1*\n1 +scose\n\n, v==\n\n(1+_)\n\n, T= 2_\n\nwhere s = (r= - r,)/(r= + r,) is the eccentricity of the orbit.\n\nAtmospheric drag produces azimuthal deceleration that first reduces orbital ellipticity, and then causes the\ndebris particle to slowly spiral inwards towards the earth until the rapidly rising density (shown on the next\npage) causes it to precipitously lose altitude and self-destruct. Transforming to e as the independent\nvadable for convenience, the reentry trajectory is described by the coupled differential equations\n264\n\nd2(l/r)/de = = p]l-I2 - l/r\n\ndH/d0 = - pCoA/2m r2v.\n\nand\n\nThe first equation remains unchanged from the vacuum\ncase, and the second describes the rate of change of\nangular momentum H where the drag coefficient Co =\n2D/pv 2 for hypersonic flight is nearly a constant with the\nNewtonian value 2.\n\n;\n\n_\ni,\n\nj\n\nI\n\n,_ 100\n\n,s\n\n,,\n\n10"\n!\n0\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\n0\n800\n\n1000\n\n.Nltf&ldS,km\n\n_\n\nH=\n\n2esin_2\n\nr-r=\n\n-/\xc2\xa2\n\n=\n\nI\n\n10--\n\n-AN= _\n_-_[_A _ = P___m_ e\'--E-de= r_m\nr_\nr.H\nJ\n-R\n\nI\n\n10"\n\nThe drag is localized near perigee for an initial\nhighly-elliptical orbit, and this essentially produces a\nnegative tangential Av with no change of perigee, each\nensuing orbit having decreased ellipticity until a circular\ncondition is reached with nearly the original perigee\naltitude. Assuming an exponential density variation which\nthe data shows is appropriate at high altitudes, the\nchange in angular momentum per orbit during the eady\nstages where integrated drag is the least and most of the\ntime is spent is given approximately by\n\nC"\n\nI\n\nr,H J" e "_-\'_ (\'+E)(I+IECOSe) dO\n"_\n\nH\' _#/2\n\np,C.A I"\n\n(1----;7\nde=P\'_\'(I*,)_\n\n-L-,\n\nThus,\n/\n\nusing the orbital period T, so, if the time spent near final circularization is small, we find the time _ to reach\nthat condition to be given by\ni" _d_\n= _.e_+..mr. vz=\nin the other limit of nearly circular orbits, the equations reduce to\nr=_ H2 and _\n\n=- _\n\ndH\n\n1\n=-_\n\ndr\n\n= _ _1\n\ndr\n\nso that the reentry time t is given by\n\n_\n\n_dr\n\np_r\nr.,\n\nr.,\n\nand is again inversely proportional to the density in the initial circular orbit and to the ballistic coefficient\nCoNm.\nNASA has calculated the lifetime for reentry for a variety of debris objects beginning in circular orbit, and\nthe results are shown on the next page at the upper left (Ref: "Orbital Debris, A Technical Assessment\',\nNational Research Council, National Academy Press, 1995.) The data for all of the curves has been\nreplotted beside it in terms of the parameter Adm, and it is clear that the form accurately represents the\nresults over the entire range, and that the results closely track the density data as predicted by the simplified\nmodel.\n265\n\nli,_m\n\n1000\nI\n\nIoojwo\n\nI\n\nR*Oix:llon j\nof\n\n.o\'\xc2\xb0\xc2\xb0\'\xc2\xb0"\xc2\xb0\'\xc2\xb0\xc2\xb0\'\xc2\xb0\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nIJl\n\nd,,_y I/\n\nt,,_,_ 1..#\n,_-\'i. _\'"o_lN z:ll_i /\n\nR.\n\n,0\n\n//.:,,,/.,.,\n\ni I - 0,1\n\nJ\n\n,\n\n\'\n\n0,01\n\n0.00t\n\n/\n\ni\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nm\n\nm I-\n\nQ.,\n\nII\n\norb\xc2\xa2_ dltude,\n\nkm\n\nA unified picture of the reentry behavior for arbitrary initial\nconditions has been obtained by numerical integrating the\nlllllir llll i=lei,\nill Im\nllllll )\ndifferential equations using Mathematica and an exponential\nlili/II_i\ni\natmosphere with a constant scale height L, and representative\nli4\ni\n_\nii_Ii\n.ll,._ _\ni\nI\n_\'"_i\nresults are shown at the\ndght.\nAs should be\nlz0\n,,,,_ira0.1\nexpected, highly elliptical orbits first show a decay of apogee\n11s # V i _ A, ,\n_0 !\ni ii\ni\naltitude with fixed perigee, followed by an increasingly rapid\n_ ;05\ndecrease of perigee to an abrupt reentry.

The full\neffect of el,\nli_iclty is just to multiply the lifetime by the factor\nl+V2(sro/l_) , and the consequence of doing so is shown on the\nnext page. The results appear to agree well with those of KJngHele.\n\nIt is interesting to note from an operational viewpoint that, while the greatest concentration of debris is known\nto be located 800 - 1200 km above the Earth\'s surface, the lifetime of that material - which is relatively\ndifficult to reach with a ground-based laser - is 102 - 10_ longer than that of debris in the region near the\n400+ km attitude of the high-value International Space Station Alpha.\n\nSorer\nMaxknum\n\nlO\n_\n100\n\n200\n\n400\n\n700\n\n90Min\n\n1Day\n\n30Dlys\n\npedgee/Umude, km\n\nIYr\n\n10Yrl\n\n1000Yr=\n\nUflt_e\n\nLif_ime Reduction\nPulses from a ground-based laser can effectively reduce the lifetime of a debris particle in space by ejecting\na small amount of mass, partially ionizing it to create a plasma, and then by producing a pressure wave\nthrough absorption in the plasma. The wave forms across the exposed surface of the material, so the\nresulting force is normal to that surface. The time-integrated force from a single pulse is an impulse that in\nturn translates into a velocity increment, and the gross result for a train of pulses is a series of such Av\'s that\nmodify the orbit such that the integrated drag is increased and the particle more quickly reenters. To put\nthis in perspective, Av scales as C__E/M, so a particle with mass M of I gram receives a Av of only 0.1 mps\nfrom 1 joule of incident energy E at a coupling coefficient Cm of 10 dynes/watt; since typical orbital velocity\nin LEO is about 7900 mps, many such pulses will therefore be required to cause a significant change in the\norbit. Although eccentricity and perigee altitude (the two orbital parameters most affecting lifetime) may be\nsignificantly affected during the exposure time, the local velocity and radial distance will change little during\nthat period, so it is within the spirit of this analysis to treat the total impulse as purely incremental and to\nleave higher order effects to computer analysts.\nSince each laser pulse effectively produces an incremental velocity which does not affect the local radial\ncoordinate r but does change the other properties of the appropriate ellipse through that point, it is useful to\ndescribe the orbit in terms of its local velocity components Vr and ve, i.e.\nVr = IEH c sine, rye = H, H2/p.r= 1 + s cose.\n267\n\nThen,\n\nxy\ntane=\n\n_.-_.,\n\nx\'\ne=-_/(xa. 1)2+xay _, _=\n\n+---_\'\n1\n\nx= vo\'_/_\' Y=V,\'_/_\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nwhere _/pJr, the local circular velocity, is about 7900 mps in low Earth orbit as noted above. The orbital\nparameters s, 0, and rJr are plotted below on a "hodograph" plane using normalized velocity components x\nand y as coordinates, and an expanded view of that plot about (0, I), more appropriate for neady circular\norbits, is shown on the next page.

The effect of a\nvelocity increment Av can be graphically represented by drawing its vector with appropriate magnitude and\ndirection from its point of origin in velocity space, and the head of the vector then defines e, e, and r,Jr for\nthe new orbit. If the perturbation is truly impulsive, the radius r is unchanged and the new perigee altitude is\ngiven directly.\nCurves of constant rD/r in the first hodograph plot have been replaced in the expanded version on the next\npage with lifetime profiles based upon the previously derived model and given by\nPCoA,j_-r\n\n268\n\n,r r,\n\ne-_(1--_)\n\n_=1_\n1;-1\n0.1\n\n/\n\nr&" 100\n\nI\n\n0.08\n\n_:10\n\n0.06\nMode\n0.04\n\n0.02\nNormalized\nrad_l 0\n\nI\n\n-0.02\n\nLifetime\n\nReduction\n\n..0.04\n\n-0.06\n\n-0.08\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nI\nI\n!\n/\n\n-o.1\n\nwhere z is a dimensionless\n\nI\n\nlifetime with its parameters\n\nevaluated\n\nat the intercept condition,\n\nand for which\n\nit\n\nis important to understand that it is ratios that are important, not the individual z values themselves.\nLifetime curves in the upper half of the figure correspond to r/L "- 100, while those in the lower half are for\nr/L = 70 and 140; they should be understood to be symmetric about the horizontal axis, and are shown9_s\nthey are simply for clarity.\nThere is relatively little effect of changes of r/L at the right where 0 <\nbecause the altitude there is very nearly that at perigee, but, otherwise, the curves are dramatically\ncompressed as r/L decreases (meanin_l that lifetime is far more easily reduced.) The much closer spacing\nof all sets of lifetime curves for 0 > 9(]\nfact means that a properly directed Av will be much more effective\nthere than it will be near perigee, but it should be noted that the anti-azimuthal\nimpulses of greatest benefit\nthere will more difficult to produce with a ground-based laser, and the propagation distances willbe larger\nbe\nas well. Aside from laser propagation effects, the most effective application of velocity changes for lifetime\nreduction will be outwardly normal to the curves of constant t in the hodograph plane.\nThis comssponds in\nthe physical plane to nearly radially-outward\nnear perigee in the ascending mode to anti-azimuthal\nnear\napogee and then to nearly-radially inward near perigee in the descending mode. The examples shown in\nthe expanded figure were arbitrarily selected and correspond\nto equivalent positions in the ascending and\ndescending modes; the vectors point in the direction of greatest lifetime change, and the light-colored\nsectors depict the allowable range of impulse angles for lifetime reduction.\nThe mean impulse for most\ndebris objects will generally be close to the direction of the laser beam, so the angle _pbetween the impulse\nvector and the local radial will be limited as shown by the dark-colored sectors to about :t:75\xc2\xb0 by atmospheric\neffects [as a matter of convenience for use of the graph, the vector lengths and the radii of the light and\ndark sectors are respectively 0.05, 0.04, and 0.03 in terms of normalized velocity.]\n269\n\nIt should be clear from the figure that the allowable operating space (the region of overlap of the laser and\nlifetime sectors) for small Av vanishes as perigee is approached in the descending mode, that it is\n270a1_o\n> Aal_l>e _l_\'i\'_g__ in tl_e ._ing\non_.\n.mode, and that it only moderately favors the ascending mode for\n_.v __u\n_, _\nemaem operabon can be achieved anywhere in the orbit with a sufficiently high\nL_v. /he curves mum De mtecpreted carefully, though, because they can be misleading.
