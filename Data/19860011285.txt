Such hydraulic lines are often\ninsulated to protect against temperature extremes and maintenance procedures\nbetween usage requires removal of insulation to check for leaks. This\ninvention provides a ready means of visually checking for leaks without time\ndelays associated with removal and replacement of insulation.\nThe invention is a fluid leak indicator (30) for detecting and indicating\nleaks in visually inaccessible fluid tubing joints (20, 21), such as those\nobstructed by insulation (24), which includes a bag system (25) and a\nwicking system (30) surrounding or wrapping the joints (20, 21) under the\nvisual obstructing material (24).\nLeaking fluid is collected in the bag\n(25) or on the wicking material (34) where it is conducted along the wicking\nmaterial (34) to a visibly accessible capturing transparent indicator bulb\n(35) for providing a visual indication of the leak without requiring a\nchemical change in the capturing indicator bulb (35).\nNovelty of the invention resides in the use of an indicator to collect fluid\nat a point distant from the leak and to readily indicate presence of leaks\nwithout the requirement of a chemical change in the indicator.

Haines\n\nPatent\nMSC-20783-1\nSerial No. 738,931\nFiled\n5/29/85\n\n1\n\nFLUID LEAK INDICATOR\n\nOrigin of the Invention\n\n5\n\nThe invention described herein was made in the\nperformance of work under a NASA contract and is subject\nto the provisions of Section 305 of the National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958, Public Law 85-568 (72\nStat. 435; 42 U.S.C. 2457).\nBackground of the Invention\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\nThe present invention relates to leak detection, and more particularly to a passive fluid leak\ndetector and indicator which is particularly suited for\ndetecting leaks in hidden, visually obstructed locations.\nMany hydraulic systems have several joints\nand/or fittings which are not readily visible, and are\nthus difficult to inspect during normal maintenance.\nSometimes minor leakage at such joints is not a problem,\nso routine inspections are not necessary.\nWith other\nequipment, such as aerospace systems like the Space Shuttle, leakage can be even more critical than on conventional aircraft or ground hydraulic systems. Maintenance\nand turn-around inspection times in such specialized\ncraft are therefore impacted by the necessity to verify\nthe hydraulic system integrity. In such cases, hidden\n\nPatent\n\njoints and fittings can considerably increase this\nspection time.\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\nin-\n\nMany so-called "hidden" joints, while not directly accessible visually, can still be easily inspected, for example with inspection mirrors.\nHowever,\nwhen portions of the hydraulic system are insulated, as\nin spacecraft such as the Shuttle, such indirect\nobservation is precluded and leak detection becomes a difficult, time consuming, and critical problem.\n(The Shuttle\nhas over 2,000 joints which must be inspected at the conclusion of each flight.)\nThe prior art, of course, includes various\nknown means for remote detection of"leaks. Much of this\ntechnology, however, is elaborate and heavy, and not\nreadily adaptable to use with aerospace systems.\nThere\nare a number of relatively\nsimple leakage detectors\nknown, but these primarily reveal or provide a telltale\nat the location of the leak, and are not adequate to provide a remote indication in the environment just described.\nFor example, U.S. Patents No. 2,601,84.0 (M.F.\nSmith et al., issued July 1, 1952) and No. 2,708,896\n(M.F.\n\nSmith\n\net al . , issued May 24, 1955) disclose\n\npro-\n\ntective covers for pipe flanges and valves. The covers,\nwhich are intended to contain possibly harmful\nleakage\n25\n\nmaterials,\n\nhave\n\nindicating chemicals to reveal\n\nsuch\n\na\n\nleak. In several embodiments a wick may be used to conduct the fluid to an indicator outside the cover by means\nof capillary\naction.\nRemote indication as discussed\nabove, however, is not addressed.\n30\n\n35\n\nU.S. Patent No. 3,485,085 (W.M. Hawkins, Jr.,\nissued December 23, 1969) discloses a leak detector\naround a joint, wherein moisture which leaks condenses\nand then travels by capillary action to a leak detecting\ntape.\nThe color and resistivity of the tape then change\nto reveal the detected leak. The leak detecting tape is\ndisplaced a short distance from the joint not due to visual inaccessibility, but to provide room for intervening\n\nPatent\n\ninsulation\nthe joint.\n\nto\nU.S.\n\n5\n\n10\n\nkeep -the leak detecting tape cooler\nPatents\n\nNo.\n\n2,918,033\n\n(Snyder,\n\nthan\nissued\n\nDecember 22, 1959) and No. 2,918,893 (Norton,\nissued\nDecember 29, 1959) provide in situ detection of leakage\nat joints which are apparently already visibly\naccessible.\nU.S. Patent No. 2, 4.60,215 (K.J. Chase, issued\nJanuary 25, 19A9) discloses a telltale for frozen food\npackages. A water capsule breaks upon freezing, and subsequent melting causes a wick to convey the water to a\nvisual color changing indicator at the surface\nof the\n\n15\n\npackage being monitored. The device is thus not directed\nto remote leakage detection. Also, it depends upon a\nchemical which changes color when wetted by the moisture\nwhich is being detected.\nAs may be seen, therefore, a need still remains\nfor an improved, inexpensive, uncomplicated, and light\nweight\n\n20\n\nfluid leak indicator for detecting fluid leaks in\n\nhidden,\ncator\n\nvisually inaccessible locations.\nshould\n\nbe easy to install, should\n\nSuch an\n\nindi-\n\npreferably\n\nbe\n\nable to provide an indication at a point distant from the\n\n25\n\nleak, and should also be able to readily indicate the\npresence of leaks without requiring a chemical change in\nthe indicator. Ideally, such an indicator should also be\nresistant to "false alarms" which might occur from exposure to fluid at locations other than that being monitored.\nFurther, such an indicator should, in the preferred\n\n~30\n\nembodiment, be physically self-sustaining, as may\n\nbe required, ouch that it can retain its own\nwhatever configuration may be desired.\n\nshape\n\nin\n\nSummary of the Invention\n\nneeds\n35\n\nand\n\nBriefly, the present invention meets the above\nand purposes with an improved fluid leak indicator\nmethod for detecting fluid leaks in hidden, visually\n\nPatent\n\nORIGINAL\nOF POOR QUALFTY\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n*>\n\ninaccessible locations. In a preferred embodiment of the\ninvention, the fluid leak indicator includes a length of\nbraided "KEVLAR" wicking material having a portion at a\nvisually inaccessible first location of potential fluid\nleakage.\nThis location is preferably enclosed in a\nsemi-sealed bag which helps direct any such fluid leakage\nto the wicking material. The braided wicking\nmaterial\nthen extends from the visually inaccessible first location to a visually accessible second location which is\ndistant from the first location. In this manner the\nwicking material, by means of capillary action, conducts\nleakage fluid which may be present at the first location\nto the second location, where it can be collected as\nneeded .\nA capturing transparent indicator bulb is positioned in contact with the wicking material at the visually accessible second location. The bulb thereby collects leakage fluid conducted thereto by the wicking material, to visually indicate the presence therein of the\nleakage fluid. The capturing transparent indicator bulb\nprovides this indication without requiring a chemical\nchange, by including therein, in the preferred embodiment, fibrous insulation which readily reveals the presence of leakage fluid without requiring a chemical\nchange.\nTo help the fluid leak indicator retain whatever configuration may be desired, and to make it resistant to exposure to fluids at locations other than\nthat being monitored, the corresponding portion(s) of the\nindicator includes an impervious transparent coating of\nheat shrink tubing applied to the exterior thereof. Having been shaped under heat, it then retains that shape\nwhile cool. Also, the capturing indicator bulb includes\nsuch heat shrink tubing surrounding the fibrous insulation, this tubing being partially closed at each end\nthereof.\n\nPatent\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\nIn operation, the detector is first fabricated\nand shaped as desired. Then the end thereof opposite the\ncapturing indicator bulb is placed vithin the semi-sealed\nbag in contact with the visually inaccessible region of\npotential fluid leakage. The capturing indicator bulb is\nthen located in the second, visually accessible location,\nso that the wicking material can then conduct leakage\nfluid from the former to the latter for collection in the\ncapturing indicator bulb. The presence of such fluid in\nthe capturing transparent indicator bulb provides a visual indication, without requiring a chemical change in\nthe indicator, which reveals a leak at the visibly inaccessible location.\nIt is therefore an object of the present invention to provide an improved fluid leak indicator and\nmethod for detecting fluid leaks in hidden, visually inaccessible locations; such an indicator and method in\nwhich a wicking material extends from a visually inaccessible first location of potential fluid leakage to a\nvisually accessible second location distant from the\nfirst location, for conducting leakage fluid from the\nfirst location to the second location; which includes an\nindicator means on the wicking material at the visually\naccessible second location; in which the indicator means\ncollects leakage fluid conducted thereto by the wicking\nmaterial for visually indicating the presence of the\nleakage fluid at the indicator; in which the indicator\nprovides such a visual indication without requiring a\nchemical change in the indicator; and to accomplish the\nabove objects and purposes in an inexpensive, uncomplicated, durable, versatile, light weight, economical, and\nreliable method and apparatus which are easy to install\nand readily suited to the widest possible utilization in\nthe detection and indication of fluid leaks in hidden,\nvisually inaccessible, and often remote locations.\n\nPatent\n\nThese and other objects and advantages of the\ninvention will be apparent from the following description, the accompanying drawings, and the appended claims.\nBrief Description of the Drawings\n5\n\nFig. 1 is a somewhat figurative illustration,\npartially in section, showing a fluid leak indicator according to the present invention installed on two visually inaccessible hydraulic fittings which are surrounded\nwith insulation;\n\n10\n\nFig. 1A illustrates the\nvisible change in\nof the indicator bulb shown in Figs. 1 and 2;\nFig. 2 is a plan view, partially in section, of\nleak indicator shown in Fig. 1; and\nFig. 3 is a plan view, flat pattern, of the\nfilm bag which encloses the visually obstructed\nfittings shown in Fig. 1 .\n\nappearance\nthe fluid\n15\n\npolyimide\nhydraulic\n\nDescription of the Preferred Embodiment\n\nproved\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\nWith reference to the drawings, the new and imfluid leak indicator for detecting fluid leaks in\n\nhidden, visually inaccessible locations, and the method\ntherefor according to the present invention, will be described.\nFig. 1 shows a* hydraulic line 10 and bulkhead\nfitting 20 passing through a bulkhead 12. Bulkhead 12\nmight divide, for example, a relatively benign\nenvironment or region 14 from a hostile one 15Line 10 is shown with three fittings 19, 20,\nand 21. Fitting 19 is located in region H, while fittings 20 and 21 appear in region 15- To help protect\nline 10 from the hostile environmental conditions in\nregion 15, the portions of line 10 in region 15 are accordingly surrounded with thermal insulation 24For\nreasons further explained below, portions of fittings 20\nand 21 in region 15\nare\nalso surrounded with a\n\nPatent\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\nsemi-sealed polyimide film bag 25, located between the\nfittings and the insulation 24. As illustrated, the insulation consists of an inner layer 26 of fibrous insulation and an outer layer 27 of metal foil (folded and\nsecured with staples 28 at the top). Clearly, due to the\ninsulation 24, fittings 20 and 21 are not visually accessible for inspection for leakage. To verify their integrity it has therefore ordinarily been necessary to remove\nthe insulation, inspect the fittings, and then apply a\nnew insulative covering - an expensive and time consuming\nprocess .\nThe present invention provides a visual detection system or fluid leak indicator 30 (Fig. 2) which\nprovides for rapid inspection of joints or fittings such\nas fittings 20 and 21 without regard to visual obstructions such as the insulation 24. In the preferred embodiment, this consists of a wicking material 34 which\nsurrounds the visually inaccessible joint areas 20 and 21\nof the hydraulic system 10 and directs any leakage\nfluids, by capillary action, to a remotely located and\nvisually accessible capturing indicator bulb 35When\nthe fluid which is to be detected is hydraulic fluid,\nsuch as the red hydraulic oil (MIL-H-83282) used on the\nShuttle system, the wicking material 34 in the preferred\nembodiment is braided aramid fiber sleeving sold under\nthe Trademark "KEVLAR 49" and having characteristics as\ndescribed in Dupont Bulletin K-5 "KEVLAR Aramid 1 1 , dated\nSeptember, 1981 .\nAs may be seen in Fig. 1, the wicking material\n34 is wrapped around the fittings 20 and 21 and secured\nin contact therewith, for example, by adhesive tape 37.\nThe semi-sealed bag 25 (e.g., polyimide film conforming\nto MIL-P-46112) forms a bagging means which encloses the\nfittings 20 and 21 and helps to collect any fluid which\nleaks, to keep such leakage fluid off the insulation 26,\nand to direct the fluid to the wicking material 34- The\nwicking material then absorbs the hydraulic fluid and\n\nPatent\n\n8\nconducts it by capillary action, as indicated above, to\nthe capturing indicator bulb 35 at the opposite end of\nthe wicking material 34- The bulb 35 is located remotely\nfrom fittings 20 and 21, outside the insulation 24., and\n5 therefore visually accessible for inspection for leakage\nfrom fitting 20 or 21.\nFig. 2 shows the fluid leak indicator 30 in\ngreater detail. As may be seen therein, a portion of the\nwicking material 34 has an outer impervious transparent\n10 heat shrink tubing 42 (e.g., MIL-I-7444) applied thereto.\nTubing 42 prevents the wicking material 34 from transferring leakage fluid to adjacent insulation 26 when\npassing from bag 25 to the outside as shown in Fig. 1,\nand from absorbing liquids at locations other than the\n15 leakage areas being monitored (i.e., fittings 20 and 21).\nIn the preferred embodiment, tubing 42 also strengthens\nthe wicking material and keeps it in whatever predetermined configuration may be desired. To accomplish this,\nthe tubing 42 in the preferred embodiment is simply\n20 transparent heat shrink tubing, to which the desired\nshape or configuration is imparted while under heat. It\nis then cooled in that shape so that it then retains that\nshape in use.\nThe capturing indicator bulb 35, as particu25 larly shown in Fig. 2, is likewise composed on the outside of transparent heat shrink tubing 42, partially\nclosed at each end thereof. Within the transparent heat\nshrink tubing bulb portion 35 is fibrous insulation material 45 in contact with the wicking material 34Any\n. 30 suitable material that meets the requirements of the\nenvironment may be used which visibly changes upon being\nwetted with the leakage material, preferably without\nrequiring a chemical change for the visual indication.\nSuch a visual change is depicted in Fig. 1A, where the\n35 white insulation 45 is visibly darker due to being wetted\nby the leakage liquid. When the liquid being detected is\nthe hydraulic oil as described above, a suitable fiber\n\nPatent\n\n45, for example, is .fibrous insulation such as that which\nmeets Rockwell International\nCorporation\nSpec. No.\nMB0135-024 (available from Hitco-Defense Products Div.,\nGardena, Calif., Part No. TG-15,000 Fiber). White insu5 lation 45 is preferred for the indicator bulb since the\n"KEVLAR" braiding, while an excellent wicking\nmaterial,\nshows little color change when wetted with this hydraulic\noil.\nFig. 3 shows a flat pattern of the polyimide\n10 film bag 25 used to enclose the fittings 20 and 21 and\nthe fluid collecting portions of fluid leak indicator 30,\nas shown in Fig. 1. The flat pattern configuration will\nchange, of course, according to the type of fittings\nused. Half inch wide double-faced adhesive transfer tape\n15 47, such as Scotch 465 (MIL-P-19834B, Type 1) is attached\nalong the bag perimeter to provide the desired sealing of\nedges when the bag is used as an enclosure to contain the\nleakage fluid. Where the bag interfaces a bulkhead 12 as\nin Fig. 1, additional tape 48 is used to secure the bag\n2o to the bulkhead.\nAs may be seen, therefore, the present invention has numerous advantages. It particularly provides a\nconvenient and quick visual indicator for rapid inspection of hidden, visually inaccessible locations for pos25 sible fluid leakage.\nIt provides for detecting such\nfluid leaks by providing an indicator at a visually\naccessible location which is remote from the hidden leakage location being monitored. Advantageously, this indication is furnished without requiring a chemical change\n30 in the indicator. Due to the impervious heat shrink tubing 42, it is resistant to "false alarms" which might\noccur from exposure to fluid at locations other than that\nbeing monitored.\nAdditionally, the invention is inexpensive, easily adapted to various shapes, light in\n35 weight, and easy to install. And, while discussed in\nconnection with aerospace applications where detection of\neven minor hydraulic fluid leaks can be critically impor-\n\nPatent\n\n10\n\n5\n\n10\n\ntant, the invention-, clearly has valuable application in\nmany other technologies such as petroleum, chemical,\nnuclear, and any others where fluid joints and fittings\nare inaccessible or are covered, and inspection for leakage cannot be directly accomplished without altering the\nstructure, such as by removing the covering.\nWhile the methods and forms of apparatus herein\ndescribed constitute preferred embodiments of this invention, it is to be understood that the invention is not\nlimited to these precise methods and forms of apparatus,\nand that changes may be made therein without departing\nfrom the scope of the invention.\nWhat is claimed is:\n\nPatent\n\nFLUID LEAK INDICATOR\n\nAbstract of the Disclosure\nA\n\n5\n\n10\n\nfluid leak indicator (30) for detecting and\nindicating leaks in visually inaccessible fluid tubing\nn\njoints (20,21), such as those obstructed by\ninsulation\n(24),\nincludes a bag system (25) and a wicking system\n(30) surrounding or wrapping the joints (20,21) under the\nvisual obstructing material (24).\nLeaking fluid is collected in the bag (25) or on the wicking material\n(34)\nwhere it is conducted along the wicking material (34) to\na visibly accessible capturing transparent indicator bulb\n(35) for providing a visual indication of the leak without requiring a chemical change in the capturing indicator bu3b (35).\n\n'
