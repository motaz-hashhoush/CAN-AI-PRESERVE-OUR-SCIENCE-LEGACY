The Kennedy Space Center (KSC) has two CTs that were designed and built for the Apollo program in the 1960's, maintained and retrofitted for use in the Space Shuttle program. As a key element of the Space Shuttle ground systems, the crawler transports the entire 12-million-pound stack comprising the orbiter, the mobile launch platform (MLP), the external tank (ET), and the solid rocket boosters (SRB) from the Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) to the launch pad. This rollout, constituting a 3.5-5.0-mile journey at a top speed of 0.9 miles-per-hour, requires over 8 hours to reach either Launch Complex 39A or B. This activity is only a prelude to the spectacle of sound and fury of the Space Shuttle launch to orbit in less than 10 minutes and traveling at orbital velocities of Mach 24. This paper summarizes preliminary results from the Crawler Transporter Sound Attenuation Study, encompassing test and engineering analysis of significant sound sources to measure and record full frequency spectrum and intensity of the various noise sources and to analyze the conditions of vibration. Additionally, data such as ventilation criteria, plus operational procedures were considered to provide a comprehensive noise suppression design for implementation. To date, sound attenuation study and results on Crawler 2 have shown significant noise reductions ranging from 5 to 24 dBA.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "Russia", "submissionId": 20130010400, "name": "Eleventh International Congress on Sound and Vibration (ICSV11)", "location": "Saint Petersburg", "id": "bdf03e0651cc475f825e6adcfd39a762", "startDate": "2005-07-05T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20130010400, "id": "033709f516174535a10eb6ea9e8cec33", "publicationDate": "2004-01-13T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20130010400.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20130010400/downloads/20130010400.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20130010400/downloads/20130010400.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20130010400/downloads/20130010400.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
