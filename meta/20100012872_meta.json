The purpose of this paper is to look at the fundamental inputs required to build a transportation model by developing an example passenger travel demand model. The example model reduces the scale to a manageable size for the purpose of illustrating the data collection and analysis required before the first step of the model begins. This aspect of the model development would not reasonably be discussed in software help documentation (it is assumed the model developer comes prepared). Recommendations are derived from the example passenger travel demand model to suggest future work regarding the data collection and analysis required for a freight travel demand model.", "title": "Fundamental Travel Demand Model Example", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-24T22:39:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 20100012872, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Hanssen, Joel"}, "organization": {"name": "Old Dominion Univ.", "location": "VA, United States"}}, "id": "e05f241d634c466fb244c7b2c662f814"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Conference Paper", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-04-09T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 20100012872, "publications": [{"submissionId": 20100012872, "id": "cbcd3f94fd134674a9c5fe17807bdf6a", "publicationName": "Selected Papers Presented at MODSIM World 2009 Conference and Expo", "publicationDate": "2010-03-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 20100012837, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "Selected Papers Presented at MODSIM World 2009 Conference and Expo", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PROCEEDINGS", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20100012872.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20100012872/downloads/20100012872.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20100012872/downloads/20100012872.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20100012872/downloads/20100012872.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
