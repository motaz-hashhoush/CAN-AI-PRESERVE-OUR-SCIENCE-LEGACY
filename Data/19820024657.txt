b'Deep Space Payload Laundwsviathe\nSpace Transportation System\nA.\n\nL. Berman and W. E. Larkin\nTDA Mission Summ Office\n\nJ. C. McKinney\nMission Infametion S\n\nStarting with the launch of the Calileo space: iaft, now\nscheduled for 1985, deep space payloads will be launched\nvia the Space Shuttle vehicle of the Space Transportation\nSystem (STS). in sharp contrast to all previoris launches of\ndeep space payloads via expendable launch vehicles. This\nvery significant change in method of launch wlll result in\nlarge procedural changes for both flight projects and the\nDeep Space Network (DSN). in its capacity as lead suppor:\nnetwork for all deep space missions. In a previous article\n(Ref. I), the Space Shuttle impact on the DSN initial acquisition was described: in this article. procedural differences\nfor the fllpht proJett and DSN during the pre and postlaunch\npenods ate examined. In particular. major subphases of the\npre and postlaunch period are identified, and telemetry and\ncommand data flow configurations are presented for each\nsubphase The Galileo minion is used to exemplify a typical\nlaunch period sequence of events and data flow configurations.\n\nEngineering Saction\n\nMajor difimnaes for the flight proJect and DSN m the\nupcoming "pce Shuttle era are the h-ger number of s b\nu\nphases in the launch period (e.g.. Shuttle on-ortit phase of\nseveral hours. for which there was nt similar phase m the\nexpendables era) and direct launch mdvement of additional\nNASA centers (e-g., johnson Space Center) and nm-NASA\nfacilities (e+. Air Force Satellite Corrtrol Facility).\n\nSection11 describes the n~minal G l l o sequence of\naie\nevents during the launch period, Section 111 identifies major\nlaunch period subphases. while Section W identifies the telemet-, and command data flow confi@rations for each of the\nlaunch period subphases.\n\nI).
