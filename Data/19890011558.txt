Tinoco\nComputational Fluid Dynamics Laboratory\nBoeing Commercial Airplane Company\nSeattle, Washington\n\nSUMMARY\nThe use of computational methods for three-dimensional transonic flow design and analysis at the\nBoeing Company is presented. A range of computational \xe2\x80\x9ctools\xe2\x80\x9d consisting of \xe2\x80\x9cproduction\xe2\x80\x9d tools for everyday\nuse by project engineers, \xe2\x80\x9cexpert user\xe2\x80\x9d tools for special applications by computational researchers, and a new\n\xe2\x80\x9cemerging\xe2\x80\x9d tool which may see considerable use in the near future are described.Thesemethods include full\npotential and Euler solvers, some coupled to three-dimensional boundary layer analysis methods, for transonic flow analysis about nacelle, wing-body, wing-body-strut-nacelle, and complete airplane configurations.\nAs the examples presented show, such a toolbox of codes is necessary for the variety of applications typical of\na n industrial environment. Such a toolbox of codes makes possible aerodynamic advances not previously\nachievable in a timely manner, if at all.\nINTRODUCTION\nComputational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is playing a n ever increasing role in the design of air vehicles.\nCFD has joined the wind tunnel and flight test as a principal technology for aerodynamic design. When the\nnext new Boeing airplane flies, whether a n all new design, or a derivative of a n existing production aircraft,\nCFD will play a role in its design. The proper and timely use of CFD will result in a superior product with\nreduced risk and lower cost. However, note success does not come automatically with CFD, the keys to success\nare the \xe2\x80\x9cproper and timely use.\xe2\x80\x9d\nCFD today covers a wide range of capabilities in terms of computational flow physics and geometrical\ncomplexity. Figure 1 illustrates the boundary in terms of the complexity of flow physics and configuration\ngeometry that encompass what we believe is practical in industry. We realize that this boundary is continuously being challenged by researchers here and abroad.\n\n2D AIRFOIL,\nAXISYMMETRIC\n\nWINGIBODY\n\nOR NACELLE\n\nWINGIBODYI\nNACELLElSTRUT\n\nCOMPLETE\nAIRPLANE\n\nARBITRARY\nCONFIGURATION\n\nINCREASING GEOMETRICAL COMPLEXITY b\n\nfigure 7 .

CFD is used to lend understanding to the flow\nphenomena about a given geometry and to aid in the design of a piece of hardware, whether it be an all new\nwing, or a minor modification to an existing configuration. To be useful the computational method must\nfaithfully represent the dominant flow physics, adequately represent the required geometrical complexity, be\ncapable~f~rovidingsolutions a timely manner, and beaffordable.Th1s isa tal1,and as yet unfilled, order by any\nin\nsingle method. The approach at Boeing has been to assemble a toolbox with a collection of CFD tools that\nmeets the above requirements to varying degrees. In this toolbox are \xe2\x80\x9cproduction\xe2\x80\x9d tools that are in wide use\nthroughout the company by a variety of CFD users. These are well documented codes that have been specialized to a certain extent, and can be run by the nonexpert CFD users. There are \xe2\x80\x9cexpert user\xe2\x80\x9d tools, which\nmay have more general and advanced capabilities than the \xe2\x80\x9cproduction\xe2\x80\x9d codes, but are not as well developed,\nand may require special skill to run successfully. There are also \xe2\x80\x9cemerging\xe2\x80\x9d tools. New technologies under\ndevelopment, offer new capabilities, which may become \xe2\x80\x9cproduction\xe2\x80\x9d tools in the near future.\n\nNo CFD toolbox is complete without geometry and graphics tools. Geometry tools are essential for the\npreparation of the inputs to the various CFD codes. Three-dimensional graphics running on suitable workstations allow the inspection of surface and field grids prior to execution, and provide the keys to understanding\nthe frequently massive output from a typical transonic CFD solution. The \xe2\x80\x9ctimeliness\xe2\x80\x9d of CFD is very\nheavily tied into the quality of the geometry and graphics tools available. The primary tool fitting this need\nat Boeing is the interactive, three-dimensional geometry system known as the Aero Grid and Paneling\nSystem (AGPS), Reference 1. AGPS provides an efficient means of defining any three-dimensional surface or\naircraft component. These surfaces can be combined to represent a complete aircraR configuration. AGPS has\nbuilt-in and user-programmable features for extracting geometric data in the proper form for use by CFD\ncodes. Paneling, surface grid generation, and grid distribution at block boundaries for input to threedimensiona1 grid generation codes are all possible. AGPS can also display CFD results in the form of threedimensional objects with color representing the value of some flow property. Several other geometry and\ngraphics codes are also essential parts of the toolbox.\nTable 1.

The perspective presented is mainly from the view of the\nBoeing Commercial Airplane Company. However, these methods are available, and are used by other members of The Boeing Company. The focus of this paper is on transonic CFD methods for three-dimensional\nflows. n b l e 1 lists some of the common CFD tools in use a t Boeing today.\n\nSYMBOLS\n= streamtube area\n=\n\nwingspan\n\n=\n\nsection drag coefficient\n\n=\n\ndrag coefficient\n\n=\n\nsection lift coefficient\n\n= lift coefficient\n=\n\nnormal force coefficient\n\n=\n\npressure coefficient\n\n=\n\nwing chord\n\nFNPR\n\n=\n\nfan nozzle pressure ratio\n\nM\n\n= Mach number\n\nTc\n\n= Thrust coefficient\n\nX\n\n=\n\nY\n\n= lateral coordinate\n\nz\n\n=\n\na\n\n= angle of attack\n\nP\n\n= side slip angle\n\n6*\n\n= boundary layer displacement thickness\n\nr)\n\n=\n\nstreamwise coordinate\n\nvertical coordinate\n\nspan fraction\n\nSubscripts\n\nH\n\n=\n\nI\n\n= inlet\n\n00\n\n=\n\nfreestream\n\nT\n\n=\n\ntotal\n\ninlet highlite\n\n81\n\nORlOiNAL PAGE I\nS\nOF POOR QUALrrV\n\nPRODUCTION TOOLS\n\nProduction tools or codes are characterized by the following: they are used outside the research organization that created them; their documentation is adequate enough to allow use by other than their creators;\nstable versions of these codes exist for use outside the research environment that are not undergoing constant\nchange; sufficient validation of these codes has been demonstrated such that outside users are willing to\ninvest the necessary effort to use them.\n\nTwo production codes that see the most use in Boeing are A502PANAIR, a linear panel method, and\nA488, a full-potential solver with coupled boundary layer analysis for wing-body and wing-body-strut-nacelle\nconfigurations. These two codes are accessed over 2,000 times a year each. Although A502lPANAIR (refs 2\nand 3) is not a true transonic method, its ability to model complex detailed geometry, makes it the only\ncurrently usable tool in some instances. In the design of the Navy E-6A wingtip pod arrangement, shown in\nFigure 2, only A502PANAIR could handle the complex geometry a t the time. It was used in the design\nprocess to shape the pods and struts to minimize supercritical flow a t cruise conditions. The resulting design\nwas committed to manufacture and first saw real air when it flew on the aircraft. Only the emerging fullpotential TRANAIR code promises the ability to deal with fine geometric details such as tip pods, stores, or\nmissiles, etc. in a supercritical flow environment. TRANAIR will be discussed in more detail later in this\npaper.\n\nE-6A (MINUS ENGINES, TAIL)\n\nWINGTIP POD DETAIL\n\nFigure 2. E-6A Wingtip Pod-A\n\nCFD Design.\n\nFor most analyses of wing-body, or wing-body-strut-nacelle configurations a t Boeing, A488 is the code of\nchoice. A488 couples a full-potential inviscid flow solver with a three-dimensional boundary layer solution\nfor the wing. It has been undergoing continuous development and refinement for the last 10 years. The\nmethod was first demonstrated in 1978 (ref 41, and has evolved into a highly sophisticated analysis tool that\nwill rival any Navier-Stokes solver for accuracy at a small fraction of the cost for analysis of attached flows.\nA488 has evolved into a system of some 50 programs tied together with job-control language. Use of the\nsystem requires user access to numerical lofts of the wing (in either of two commonly used geometry systems\nat Boeing), body, nacelle, and strut, or files consisting of normal station cuts for the body and nacelle, and\nwaterline cuts for the strut. An input file is prepared containing flow condition information, i.e., Mach, angle\nof attack, Reynolds number, etc.; transition strip location as a function of span fraction, etc.; and file names of\nthe various geometric components. An online program is executed that generates all the job-control logic and\nsubmits the problem for execution on a CRAY X-MP. The grid generation, and cycling between the inviscid\nand viscous solvers automatically proceeds for the prescribed number of iterations, as illustrated in Figure 3.\n\n82\n%\n\ni\n\nA488-CONSERVATIVE\nFULL-POTENTIAL\nWING-BODY-STRUT-NACELLE\n\nfl\nFILES\n\nA588-EULER\nNACELLE\n\nFigure 3. Integrated TansonicNiscous Analysis System.\nA flexible and efficient elliptic grid generation method (refs 5 and 6 ) is used to generate a surface-fitted\nC-type grid. The grid distribution along the strut-nacelle requires special consideration. For a general strutnacelle installation, it is usually difficult to produce an exact surface-fitted grid with smooth and well distrib,uted mesh spacing in the field. The approach taken here involves a simplification of the nacelle inlet\nbometry and a relaxation of the requirement that the grid lines lie along the corners formed by the nacellestrut intersection and along the nacelle keel line, as illustrated in Figure 4.The tight clustering of grid lines\nclose to the wing allows adequate grid resolution in the region between the wing lower surface and the\nnacelle. The exhaust plume is modeled as a solid surface. With the proper choice of the exhaust plume shape\n(ref 7), both power effects and core cowl shape effects can be simulated.\n\nFRONT VIEW\n\nSIDE VIEW\n\nFigure 4. Grid Topology at Nacelle/Strut Station.\n\n83\n\nThe current inviscid solver is based on the full-potential, fully conservative Jameson-Caughey finite\nvolume algorithm, FL028 (ref 8). Enhancements added to the method include: a convergence acceleration\nmethod using an extrapolation technique (ref 91, and GMRES (ref 10); second-order accurate differencing for\nbetter shock resolution; and, improvements t o the calculation of surface pressures and the Kutta condition.\nThe boundary layer calculations are based on the method of McLean (ref 11). This is a three-dimensional\nfinite difference formulation for both laminar and turbulent boundary layers. In addition, a semiempirical\nshock-boundary layer interaction model (ref 12) has been added. Here, the treatment of the effects of a shock\non the boundary layer is improved by replacing the boundary layer equations in the shock zone with a set of\nempirical jump conditions for the changes in the boundary layer quantities through the shock. The boundary\nlayer equations are still used upstream and downstream of the shock zone. The determination of the shock\nzone is based on the behavior of the shock-perpendicular Mach number. The method also includes an attachment line solution at the wing leading edge which is used to determine the starting conditions for the upper\nand lower surface boundary layer solution.\nThe interaction between the boundary layer and the inviscid flow is calculated by a classical directiteration scheme. In each cycle of the iterative procedure, the viscous flow is computed in the direct mode (i.e.,\ngiven the velocity components from the inviscid outer solution calculate the boundary layer and output the\ndisplacement thickness), and a weighted average of the new and old displacement thickness is used to modify\nthe surface shape for the next cycle. The field grid for the inviscid solver is automatically updated with each\ndisplacement thickness change.\nA488 results have been compared with experimental data for a variety of vehicles. Figure 5 shows a\ncomparison of A488 results with wing pressure distributions measured in flight on a 737-300. The computational model consisted of the wing, body, strut, and nacelle. The wing definition included the estimated\naeroelastic twist for the condition flown. Although the character of the pressure distribution on the wing\nchanges dramatically across the span, the computational results agree reasonably well with the measured\ndata.\n\nA488--FULL-. - .-..\nWICOUPLED\nBOUNDARY LAY[\n\n-lm2k\n-0.8\n\n.\nI\n\n.O\nL\n\nXIC\n\n-\n\n0.4 v.\n. .\nI\n0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0\n\n.\n1.8 1.0\n\n0\n\n\xe2\x80\x99\n\nXIC\n\nFigure 5.

This comparison illustrates the importance of accounting for the aeroelastic deflections that occur in the wind tunnel. The wind tunnel model was a\nfull model with a steel wing and was tested in a n atmospheric tunnel. At the dynamic pressure for Mach 0.80\nand at the cruise lift, the estimated additional wing twist at the wingtip due to aeroelastics was 0.5 deg.\nInclusion of the aeroelastic twist in the computational model definition was essential for good agreement\nwith the experimental data.\n\n757-200\nMACH = 0.80\n\nA488 (MODELGEOMETRY)\n\n0.7 r\n\n0.6\n\n-\n\n0.5\n\n-\n\n0.4\n\n-\n\n______-------__\n\n0\xe2\x80\x99\n0\n\nWIND TUNNEL\nTEST P T = 1 ATMOSPHERE\nA488 (MODEL GEOMETRY\nPLUS AEROELASTIC TWIST)\n\nI\n\n0.1\n\nI\n\n0.2\n\nI\n\n0.3\n\nI\n\n0.4\n\nq-SPAN\n\nI\n\n0.5\n\nI\n\n0.6\n\no\n\\\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\n0.9\n\n1.0\n\nFRACTION\n\nFigure 6.

This timeit shows a GrummanF-14\nwith the wing set a t the 20-deg sweep position. These analyses were done in support of a variable sweep\nboundary layer transition flight experiment (ref 13).With the exception of the inner-most station, the computational results agree well with the measured data. The discrepancy at the most inboard station is believed to\nbe due to the inability of the method, with its single block C-grid topology, to adequately represent the\nfuselage. The surface grid used for the analysis is shown in Figure 8. The general cross-section of the fuselage\nis represented but the engine inlet has been gridded over. This example illustrates the need for methods\ncapable of handling more general and complex geometries.\n\n85\n\nM,\n\nC\n,\n\n=\n\n0.8\n\n- 0.33\n\n-1.2\nALE = 20 DEG\nRe\n0.69 X lo6 1IM -0.8\n(2.25X lo6 1IFT)\n\n-1.2\n\n-\n\n-0.8\n\n-0.4\n\n-0.4\n\nCP\n\nCP\n0\n\n0\n\n.o\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\n0.8\n\n0.8\n\n-.\n\n-1.2\n\n-1.2\n-0.8\n\n-0.8\n\n-0.4\nCP\n0\n\n.O\n\n-0.4\n\nCP\n0\n\n.o\nFLIGHT TEST\n- ANALYSIS\n\n.O\n\n00\n\n0.4\n0.8\n\n0.4\n\n0.8\'\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\nI\n\nI\n\nFigure 7, Comparison With Flight Pressure Distributions-F- 14.\n\nFigure 8.

Using analyses at fullscale Reynolds number as a guide, trip strip patterns can be designed for low Reynolds number testing which\nwill best result in a displacement thickness at the shock or trailing edge comparable to the expected full-scale\nvalue. The spanwise distribution of skin friction and profile drag can also be derived from the boundary layer\n4,\ncalculations. The profile drag is based on applying the Squire Young formula (ref 1 1 along the wing trailing\nedge. Only the streamwise components of the trailing-edge velocity profiles are used in this formulation. A\ncomparison with measured profile drag is shown in Figure 9. The distribution and level of profile drag are in\ngood agreement with the test data. The skin-friction drag distribution is shown for reference. The experimental profile drag was derived from a series of wake traverses along the wingspan. For subcritical flows, the\nwake total pressure deficit is due only to the profile drag. For supercritical cases wave drag also adds to the\ntotal pressure deficit. Figure 10 shows a comparison for wave drag and profile drag. Measured and calculated\nprofile and wave drags agree reasonably well. Examination of the spanwise variation of wing drag components helps identify the critical wing design regions and allows for better wing design.\nCOMMERCIAL TRANSPORT CONFIGURATION\n0.016\n\nWING DRAG DISTRIBUTION M = 0.70\nCD = 0.00868 A488\n\n0.014\n\nCD = 0.00852 EXPERIMENT\ny A 4 8 8 PROFILE DRAG\n\n0.012\nCD\n\n0\n\n0.010\n\n0.004\n\nQ\n\nA488 FORM DRAG\n\nI\n\n0\n\n1\n\nI\n\n1\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\n0.9\n\n1.0\n\nV-SPAN FRACTION\n\nFigure 9.

Although methods such as A488 can be used\nto develop drag polars (see Figure 11, for example), CFD has not yet matured to the level where it is capable\nof predicting complete airplane configuration drag to the accuracy needed for commercial transport development. The competitive nature of the commercial transport industry makes drag improvements of less than\none percent airplane drag significant and worth seeking. CFD methods capable of reliably and accurately\npredicting drag values, even component drags, would be of great value to the aircraft designer. Methods like\nA488 may be able to do this for transport type wings with attached flow, but there is a lack of experimental\ndata to adequately validate these methods. Adequate validation requires detailed test-theory comparisons a t\nseveral combinations of Mach number, angle of attack, and Reynolds number. Not only are force data necessary for validation, detailed surface pressure data and wake measurements are also required.\n\nCOMMERCIAL TRANSPORT CONFIGURATION\n\n//\xe2\x80\x99\n\n-\\EXPERIMENT\n\n\\CONVERGED\n\nTHEORETICAL\nRESULTS\n\nC\nL\n\nCD SHIFTED TO MATCH\nTEST DATA BASED\nON THIS VALUE AT\nM = 0.70, C = 0.26\nL\n\nOLI\n\n0.030\n\nI\n\n0.035\n\nI\n\nI\n\n0.045\n\n0.040\n\nI\n\n0.050\n\nI\n\n0.055\n\nCD\n\nFigure 7 1. Comparison of Computational and Experimental Drag Polars.\n\nThe ability to adequately model the nacelle and strut is essential for many of our applications. The\npresence of the nacelle and strut can have a significant effect on surface pressures on the upper as well as the\nlower surface of the wing, as illustrated in Figure 12. We have had reasonable success in simulating engine\ninstallation details such as engine primary core cowl shape effects on wing lower surface pressure distributions (Fig13),and engine power effects cFigl4). Figure 13 shows the difference in wing lower surface pressure\ndistribution that results when the engine primary core cowl is truncated to yield a desired inlet mass flow\nratio in a wind tunnel flow through nacelle compared to what might be achieved by the actual engine\ngeometry. Figure 14 shows the difference between the engine operating a t cruise thrust or exhausting a t\n\xe2\x80\x9cram\xe2\x80\x9d fan nozzle pressure ratio, i.e., exhausting at free-stream Mach number. These effects are simulated by\nspecification of the appropriate fan exhaust plume shape (ref 7).\n\n88\n\nUPPER\nSURFACE\n\nA-1.2\n\nNACELLE ON\nNACELLE OFF\n\n-0.8\n\n737-300/CFM56-3\nMach = 0.74\n\nCP\n-0.4\n\n0.0\n\n0.4\n\n0.8\n\n-1.2\n-0.8\n\nNACELLE ON\nNACELLE OFF\nUPPER\nSURFACE\n\nCP\n-0.4\n\nCP\n\n\\\n\nrLOWER\nLOWER\nSURFACE\n\n-0.4\n\n0.0\n\nXIC\n0.4\n\nSURFACE\n\nFigure 12.

A555 is complementary to A488. Both use a n\nenhanced version of FL028 for their inviscid solver, and the same three-dimensional finite difference boundary layer code. The solutions are completely reversible, that is, one can take the pressure distribution from\na n A488 analysis, run it through A555 and recover the original A488 geometry. The use of A555 is illustrated\nin Figure 15. An initial seed geometry is first analyzed.

Several preprocessors\nare available to assist the designer in specifying distributions with the desired characteristics and proper\nsmoothness. The inverse design code then produces a geometry which includes the boundary layer displacement thickness. The boundary layer solution supplies the displacement thickness to be removed, which after\nremoval leaves the bare wing geometry. This resulting geometry is then modified as necessary to meet\nwhatever manufacturing constraints might apply, and then reanalyzed. This cycle may be repeated several\ntimes until a wing design evolves having the desired pressure characteristics and meeting all the appropriate\ngeometric constraints. The coordinated A488lA555 system has allowed wing designs to be developed in a\ntimely manner that were not previously achievable.\nAnother transonic analysis code that is occasionally used at Boeing, because of its ability to model\nwinglets in a simplified form, is the NASA WBPPWBoppe code (ref 15). This code is based on a n extended\nsmall disturbance transonic formulation, and features multiple-embedded grids.

Winglet Pressure Distributions.\nThe grid topology of the A488 system does not allow detailed analysis of the flow on the nacelle, only its\neffects on the wing. For detailed analysis of a turbofan nacelle we use A588, a three-dimensional Euler solver\ncoupled to the same three-dimensional finite difference boundary layer code as used in A488. The Euler\nnacelle code, developed for powered turbofan nacelle analysis (ref 161, is based on FL057 (ref 17). It features a\ntime-dependent solution of the Euler equations in conservative form. A C-type body-fitted computational\ngrid, illustrated in Figure 17, is used. The code solves a two-stream problem comprised of external and fan\nflows. Core flow is treated either as a solid-body extension of the input geometry or the core cowl geometry is\nsimply extended and terminated at a point. The nacelle mounting strut can also be included in the analysis.\nBoundary conditions can be specified on the inlet face to control the inlet mass flow. Total pressure, total\ntemperature, and swirl can be specified on the exit plane in the fan exhaust duct to describe the exhaust\nconditions. The code is capable of analyzing both angle of attack and yaw conditions.\n\n91\n\nFigure 17. Computational Grid for Euler Powered Nacelle Code.\nA588 has proven to be highly accurate in the calculation of the flow over isolated nacelles. Figure 18\nshows the comparison of computed results with experimental data on a axisymmetric nacelle. The test data\nwere acquired on a swept strut-mounted flow-through nacelle over a Mach number range from 0.70 to 0.925.\nA fixed mass flow ratio based on an experimental internal inlet pressure was specified for all the cases. The\nresults shown in Figure 18 are typical of the very good agreement with test data that was obtained across the\nMach number range.\nFAN COWL PRESSURES\nMEASURED OPPOSITE\n\n-0.8\n\n-O.I:\n00\n.\n0.21\n\n0.0\n\n\'\n\n[I\n\nMach = 0.925\n\n7:\n\'\n\n40\n\n"\n\n"\n\n120\n\n80\n\n\'\n\n\'\n\n160\n\nl\n\n\'\n\n200\n\nX\n\nFigure 18.

A comparison of the computed results and test data is shown in Figure 19. The test data were acquired on a swept\nstrut-mounted flow-through nacelle. The inlet mass flow ratio for the test was calibrated in a model altitude\ntest chamber. The test data were taken on the keel line, the right and left sides, and at about 30-deg right and\nleft off the crown line along the side of the mounting pylon. The computations were done for the test Mach\nnumber, angle of attack, and inlet mass flow ratio. The discrepancy near the crown line can be attributed to\na lack of modeling the mounting strut that was not included in this particular calculation. Note the\nvariation of suction peak and shock strength around the circumference of the nacelle. The lack of perfect\nagreement with the suction peak around the circumference of the inlet might be attributed to a slight\nmismatch with the actual test angle of attack and mass flow, and to the geometric tolerances between the\ngeometry tested and that used in the analysis. Note that the test data do not show perfect lefthight symmetry. However, the overall agreement is good.\n\nM\nFAN COWL\nPRESSURE\nMEASURING\nSTATIONS\n\nB\n\n5-deg.

The internal drag is accounted for by the propulsion\nengineer in the engine thrust-drag bookkeeping. For wind tunnel testing, the internal drag is determined in\na model altitude test chamber. A comparison of A588 results (plus a handbook profile drag estimate for the\nmounting strut) with experimental data is shown in Figure 20. Note the excellent agreement for both drag\nlevel and drag rise. These types of comparisons have been made for a variety of nacelles. As long as the flow\nremains attached in the computational analysis, then usually any disagreement between test and A588\nindicates a problem with the test data.\n\nI\n\n93\n\nI\n\n~\n\nlor\n\nDRAG OF ONE NACELLE BASED\nON AIRPLANE WING AREA\nCOMPUTED\n\nCD NACELLE\nCOUNTS\n\nf\n\nEXPERIMENT\n\n5-\n\n-\n\nTOTAL\n\n0.70\n\n0.75\n\n0.80\n\n0.85\n\n0.90\n\nMACH NUMBER\n\nFigure 20.

P318 is used because of its low cost to develop\nthe initial lines of a nacelle, treating the crown, keel, and sides as separate geometry. The more complete\nA588 is then used to refine and validate the design. P582 has been used to analyze difficult geometries such\nas a tractor turboprop with an offset chin inlet (ref 20).\nEXPERTUSERTOOLS\nExpert user tools or codes either have not yet matured enough in their development, or require skills\ngenerally not available outside the research environment for successful use. This category includes a series of\ncodes based on the Euler formulation, specifically Jameson\xe2\x80\x99s FL057 technology. The Euler formulation is of\nparticular interest when dealing with rotational flows, i.e., flows of varying total temperature, total pressure,\nand swirl, and with flows in which trailing wakes from one surface may interact with another surface. These\ncodes have been extended to handle complex transport type airplane configurations, illustrated in Figures 21\nand 22, featuring wing, body, vertical, and horizontal tails, body-mounted engine nacelle and pylon, and\npropfan simulator disk, or wing mounted nacelle tractor propfans (refs 21 to 25). The complexity of the grid\ngeneration for these configurations currently precludes routine \xe2\x80\x9cproduction\xe2\x80\x9d use of this capability by users\noutside the research community. Another use of these Euler based codes has been in the analysis of a detailed\npropfan nacelle including pylon and simulator disk, illustrated in Figure 23, and engine exhaust flows (refs\n26 and 27).\n\n1\n\n94\n\nORIGINAL PAGE IS\n\nOF POOR QUALITY\n\nFigure 21.

Grid for UDF Nacelle and Strut.\n\nThe basic solution technology for the unsteady Euler equations originated from Jameson\xe2\x80\x99s finite volume\napproach (FL057) (ref 17) used in A588. In order to deal with much larger problems and more complex flows\nassociated with complex aircraft configurations, considerable enhancements and improvements have been\nmade to the basic technology which include; four- or five-stage Runge-Kutta time integration, a new dissipation model based on spectral radius scaling, a multigrid technique together with successive mesh refinement\nto speed up the convergence, and a multiblock treatment. The basic idea of the multiblock approach is to\ndivide the complete flowfield into several blocks, such that the flowfield data within each block can fit in the\nexisting central memory of a supercomputer. The complete flowfield data are stored on a solid state disk\n(SSD), and the computation is done in a block-by-block manner through the use of highly efficient input/\noutput (I/O) data management. The flowfield in each block is advanced in time through one multigrid cycle.\nWithin each grid level, a four or five-stage, explicit, Runge-Kutta time integration scheme, together with a n\nimplicit smoothingmethod, is used to update the flow variables to a new time level. The updated flowfield\ndata are then moved to the SSD before another block of flowfield data is transferred to the central memory.\nTheblocks of boundary data that are needed for the adjacent blocks in the flux and dissipation term calculations are saved in different locations on the SSD, so that they can be fetched during the calculation process.\nAt the present time, the program is written such that the flowfield can be divided into an arbitrary number of\nblocks in both normal and spanwise directions to handle large problems. However, the general strategy is to\nkeep the number of blocks to a minimum, for efficient vector processing. A solution for a wing-body-tail\nconfiguration (ref 23) is shown in Figures 24 and 25. The multiblock approach allows sufficient grid density to\nadequately capture the complex shock pattern on the wing, and the detailed interaction between the vertical\nand horizontal tail surfaces on the aftbody as indicated by the pressure contours shown in Figure 24. A\ncomparison of the inviscid solution with experimental data shown in Figure 25, shows reasonable agreement.\n\nI\n\n96\n\nORIGINAL PAGE I\nS\nOF POOR QUALlrV\n747-200\n\nM\n,\n\n= 0.84\n\nCY =\n\n2.73 DEG\n\nSIDE VIEW\n\n500\n\n1,000\n\n1,500\n\n2,000\n\nX\n\n2,500\n\nTOP VIEW\n\nFigure 24.

Comparison With Wing and Tail Pressure Distributions.\n\n97\n\nFor a configuration with a propfan actuator disk, the program logic is greatly simplified if the propfan\nregion including the propeller disk is kept in one block, such that the various bo6ndary conditions on the\npropeller disk and exhaust plume can be implemented within a specified block. The propeller power loading\nis simulated by a n actuator disk where the total pressure, total temperature, and swirl distributions are\nprescribed (ref 21). Another way of simulating propeller power effects is to prescribe the thrust, normal force,\nand sideforce in the propeller disk plane. The flow variables downstream of tly-disk are related to\' their\ncorresponding upstream values through the use of continuity, momentum, and energy equations. The major\nadvantages of this method are that the effects of angle of attack as well as the influence of side flow can\neasily be simulated through the input of normal and side force distributions along the propeller disk (ref 26).\nA major application of this technology has been to the analysis of a n advanced propfan powered aircraft,\npreviously shown in Figure 21. A primary concern for a configuration with aft-mounted propfan engines is\nthe power-induced interference effects on the aircraft\'s aerodynamics. While many of these characteristics\ncan be investigated in the wind tunnel with powered propfan simulators, some conditions cannot. Small and\npowerful enough propfan simulators for testing at transonic conditions on a full model in yaw were not\navailable to us at the time of this analysis. The asymmetric effects of a failed engine at cruise could only be\ninvestigated by computational methods. (This may still be the case today.) A full configuration analysis at\nboth high and low speeds, and at yaw with various combinations of thrust on the right and left side engines\nwas carried out to look at these issues. A grid of approximately 600,000 cells was used (ref 24). The CPU time\non a CRAY X-MP for a solution was approximately two hours. The power induced effects at high speed on the\npressure distributions on the vertical and horizontal tail surfaces are illustrated in Figures 26 and 27. For a\nlow-speed, high-angle-of-attack case, the resulting moments and side force are shown in Figure 28. This type\nof information is very important to the stability and control engineer in estimating the handling characteristics of the aircraft.\n\nM a = 0.78 cx= 3 DEG\n\nSIDE VIEW\n\nSTRUT AND NACELLE\n\nSTRUT, NACELLE, AND PROPELLER DISK\n\nFigure 26.

Effects of Asymmetric Thrust on Aircraft.\n\nThe Euler solver has also been incorporated into the boundary layer cycling package used in the A488\nsystem previously described. In this implementation the boundary layer coupling can be applied to both wing\nand tail lifting surfaces. To improve the viscous coupling a contracting wake model has been added to the\nEuler solver (ref 25). This analysis package is being refined to include coupled solutions on full and partial\nchord winglet configurations.\n\n99\n\nThe natural manner in which propulsion effects can be handled in the Euler formulationmakesthis the\ntechnology of choice for many problems. However, the level of expertise required to create the necessary\nsurface-fitted grids will limit its use to a select few for the time being.\nEMERGING TOOLS\n\nTwo essential characteristics of a valuable CFD tool are timeliness and the ability to handle complex\n\xe2\x80\x9creal world\xe2\x80\x9d geometry. Requirements for CFD analysis extend far beyond the analysis of simple wing-body\nconfigurations. The multiblock Euler approach shows a promising capability to analyze rather complex geometries, but it is questionable whether the necessary surface-fitted grid generation could be done in a timely\nfashion. As finer details of the geometry become of interest, the grid generation problems become more\ndifficult. Work on unstructured grids (refs 28 and 29) may offer a solution to dealing with complex geometries.\nFor now, the structured surface-fitted grid Euler tools will continue to be special purpose tools used by expert\nusers. But what about a \xe2\x80\x9cproduction\xe2\x80\x9d tool for timely analysis of transonic flows about complex geometries for\nuse by CFDers outside the research community? Such a tool is emerging; it is called TRANAIR.\nTRANAIR (refs 30 and 31) employs a new approach for solving the full-potential equation about arbitrary configurations. One of the most important features of this approach is its compatibility, in terms of userprovided inputs regarding the configuration boundary, with the existing A502/PANAIR panel method. More\nthan two dozen CFDers throughout the Boeing Company are familiar with setting up inputs (panel models)\nfor A502IPANAIR. There is already a n extensive array of geometry tools, i.e., AGPS (ref l), available for\ncreating the necessary panel models, and there are no inherent limitations on the complexity of geometry\nthat can be described. The inputs for analysis of complex configurations with geometric details of greatly\nvarying length scales can be prepared in a timely manner. This is in sharp contrast to codes that use structured surface-fitted grids.\nTRANAIR eliminates the need for the surface-fitted grid by using rectangular grids superimposed on\nthe paneled boundary configuration, as illustrated in Figure 29. The flow both inside and outside the configuration is considered (although in aerodynamic applications, the internal flow is fictitious). A rectangular grid\nGLOBAL RECTANGULAR GRID-\n\nI\n\nFigure 29. TRANAIR Grid Topology.\n\n100\n\nORIGINAL PAGE IS\nOF POOR QUALITV\n\ncan always be superimposed on the configuration regardless of surface topology. The use of rectangular grids\nis not new. Rectangular grids have previously been used in small disturbance codes with linearized boundary\nconditions, and by Reyhner (ref 19), and others with \xe2\x80\x9cthick\xe2\x80\x9d geometries. What sets TRANAIR apart from\nprevious codes is the use of finite element techniques to ensure that the discretization of the flowfield near\nthe boundaries is flux conservative so that the conservation laws are imposed correctly and the global quantities of interest are predicted accurately, and now, the inclusion of automatic grid refinement near surface\nboundaries keyed to local panel density. The rectangular grid needs only to extend as far as the nonlinearities\nin the flowfield. The far field is handled by a discretized linear Prandtl-Glauert operator. The solution algorithm includes use of a Newton solver (nonlinear GMRES, ref 10) that uses the latest sparse matrix\ntechnology as a preconditioner. Future plans include the addition of hierarchical multigrid preconditioning.\nThe initial implementation of TRANAIR did not include the automatic grid refinement. Nevertheless,\nthe computational results were very encouraging. The initial version of TRANAIR is well suited for compact\nobjects such as fuselage forebody cabs, nacelles, etc. Figure 30 shows the paneling for a modern transport cab.\nThe paneling is fine enough to resolve the crease line at the base of the windshield. A comparison of computed results from TRANAIR, A502/PANAIR, and experimental results is also shown in Figure 30. The\nTRANAIR results are in excellent agreement with the experimental data. As is typical of linear compressible\nflow theory, the A502PANAIR results overpredict both the compression at the base of the windshield and the\nsubsequent expansion.\n\nCROWNLINE\n-0.4\n\n/\n\n0 CP\n0.4 -\n\n160\nX BODY STATION\n\n0.8 -\n\n1.2 L\n\n- TRANAIR\n-- PANAIR TECHNOLOGY CODE\nFigure 30. Pansport Cab Analysis Test Theory Comparison.\n\nA considerably more complex configuration that was analyzed with the initial TRANAIR was a n F-16\nfighter aircraft, shown in Figure 31. The configuration included the fuselage, canopy, wing, vertical and\nhorizontal tail surfaces, and details of the inlet and exhaust regions. A total of 3000 panels were used to\ndescribe the surface geometry. A rectangular grid of 129 grid points in the x direction, 33 in the y direction,\nand 33 in the z direction was superimposed on the paneled configuration. The configuration was analyzed at\nboth M = 0.6 and 0.9. In the subcritical solution, the residual error was reduced by 10 orders of magnitude in\napproximately 1350 CPU seconds on a CRAY X-MP. A comparison of the results for the Mach 0.6 case (not\nshown) with A502IPANAIR and experimental data on the wing showed excellent agreement except at the\nleading edge. For the supercritical Mach 0.9 case, the solution took 1500 CPU seconds to reduce the residual\nerror by four orders of magnitude.\n\nORIGINAL PAGE I\nS\nOF POOR QUALITY\n\n101\n\nORIaNAL PAGE IS\nOF POOR QUALITY\n\nA comparison of TRANAIR results for the Mach 0.90 analysis of the F-16 configuration with experimental data on the wing is shown in Figure 32. The agreement with experimental data is quite good except at the\nleading edge. The shock is well captured, albeit further aft than indicated by the experimental data. This is\nto be expected for an inviscid solution without viscous coupling. The discrepancy at the leading edge is easily\nunderstood when the coarseness of the global grid is taken into account (fig 33). The automatic grid refinement completely eliminates this shortcoming. Figure 34 shows the resulting grid after four levels of refinement. Note that the refinement takes place in three dimensional space. Each rectangular grid cell is divided\ninto eight similar cells at each level of refinement. Figure 35 illustrates how the grid refinement ensures the\nresolution of detailed surface features. The user can specify the regions of space for refinement and the\nnumber of levels of refinement. The use of the automatic grid refinement allows use of a much sparser global\ngrid with grid enrichment only where it is needed. As a consequence, the total number of grid cells can be\nkept to a reasonable number. At this time (December 1987) solutions for the F-16 with the grid refinement\nwere not yet available. Additional TRANAIR F-16 results from the initial version without grid refinement\ncan be found in reference 32.\nM,=0.9\n\na=4 DEG\n\nOUTBOARD (71Yo SEMISPAN)\n\nINBOARD (32% SEMISPAN)\n\nCP\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1.0\n\n0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1.0\n\nx/c\n\nx/c\n0\n\nTRANAIR\n(INVISCID)\n\n0\n\nTEST DATA\n\nFigure 32.

Early\nindications are that subcritical TRANAIR solutions will be considerably cheaper than A502IPANAIR solutions for large cases, so we may see TRANAIR replacing that code. It is expected that automatic flowfield\nadaptive grid refinement will also become available in 1988 that will be very beneficial for supercritical\nsolutions. Other anticipated improvements include a continued refinement of the algorithm to improve convergence rate, incorporation of the Hafez correction (ref 33) at the shock, possible wake capturing, and\ninvestigation of extending the method to the Euler equations. Plans are also being considered to incorporate\nsome kind of viscous coupling similar to what is currently found in the A488 system and extending the code\nto the supersonic regime.\nFUTURE CHALLENGES\nOne of the hottest CFD research fields today is in Navier-Stokes solvers. Many problems, particularly\nvery high speed flows, and flows with significant separation, require the physical representation of the\nNavier-Stokes equations. But where should Navier-Stokes fit in for transonic analysis of transport type\nconfigurations? Limited use of Navier-Stokes has been made in a zonal approach to deal with jet exhaust\ninteractions (refs 7 and 34), and with open cavities (ref 35). More recently, significant progress has been made\nby others in the application of Navier-Stokes to complete transport wing-body type configurations (refs 36 and\n371, and to a fighter type configuration (ref 38). However, in industry, one does not replace a proven tool by a\nmore expensive higher technology tool unless it offers a clear benefit.\nThe Navier-Stokes applications shown to date are at least one or two orders of magnitude more expensive than the inviscidlcoupled viscous A488 solutions. For attached flow conditions we have yet to see evidence that the current Navier-Stokes solutions are more accurate. In fact, the A488 solutions may be the\nmore accurate because of the significantly higher grid density used by the finite difference three-dimensional\nboundary layer solver, and empirical modeling of the shock-boundary layer interaction zone. When the\nNavier-Stokes solvers exceed the accuracy of the coupled A488 system there will still be the question of cost.\nAs previously mentioned, A488 sees very heavy usage. During the last few years the number of A488 accesses throughout the Boeing Company have averaged over 2000 times a year. This number includes runs\nthat failed, restarts for additional iterations, and just grid generation runs. That still leaves on the order of a\n1000 complete analysis runs a year. An order of magnitude cost increase for this volume of analysis is not\ntolerable. In some wing design exercises, a very short time span is available for designing a wing for a wind\ntunnel entry. During these periods, quick turnaround is needed which is not practical with methods taking\nhours of CPU time.\nAt flight conditions resulting in some flow separation, the coupled inviscidcoupled viscous boundary\nlayer codes will generally fail t o converge to a useful solution. For these conditions Navier-Stokes may be\nable to provide flow information not accessible by lesser methods. However, experience has shown that the\noff-design handling characteristics of most interest are quite sensitive to the exact details of the flow separation phenomena. Details such as laminar t o turbulent boundary layer transition location, and the effects of\nvortex generators, leading-edge snags, wing fences, vortilons, etc., can have very dramatic effects on the\npitchup characteristics of a n aircraft. When will Navier-Stokes solvers be able to account for these types of\ndetails?\nThe preceding discussion is not meant to discourage the researchers developing Navier-Stokes technology, but rather to point out some of the \xe2\x80\x9creal world\xe2\x80\x9d challenges that must be overcome for these methods to\nbe used on a routine basis in industry. Many of the concerns related to determining 03-design handling\nqualities are also present in low Reynolds wind tunnel testing and can only be fully addressed in flight at the\npresent time. We will maintain a n active vigilance on the progress being made in Navier-Stokes technology\nand will try to incorporate the appropriate methods into our CFD toolbox at the proper time.\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\nWe have presented our current toolbox of CFD methods for three-dimensional transonic design and\nanalysis and have illustrated their use through various applications. Production, expert user, and new emerg-\n\n104\n\ning methods are all necessary parts of the toolbox. Just as a mechanic cannot work with a single wrench, we\ntoo need a mix of general purpose and special use tools. The competitive nature of the market place is forcing\nthe Boeing Company to strive to a higher plane of excellence while reducing cost. In the aerodynamic design\narena we are depending on CFD to provide the necessary leverage. However, to be of value CFD must be\nuseful in a timely manner.\nIn early 1987, a critical wing design activity within Boeing reached a n impass with regard to satisfying\nairplane performance requirements, wing structural requirements, and other practicalities necessary for a\nsuccessful overall design. It was determined that a n improvement in the transonic technology level of the\nwing could be used to satisfy all the necessary requirements. But in order to implement a new level of wing\ntechnology consistent with a tight program schedule, new designs would have to be assessed in the remainder of 1987 using available wind tunnel test windows. Two-dimensional analysis and design tools (refs 39 and\n40) were used to develop a series of airfoils to investigate different pressure distributions consistent with a\nmore aggressive design philosophy. After a confirming wind tunnel test, three wings for a wing-body configuration employing variations of the most promising design pressure distribution were designed using A488\nand A555 in a time period of a little over a month. Each design, maintaining realistic structural and manufacturing constraints, required many cycles through A488 and A555, sometimes two or three cycles in a\nsingle day, to develop. These wings were a break from the previous evolution of Boeing designs, although\nsimilar designs had been tested in the early 1970s without much success.\nThe confirming wind tunnel test, conducted in the fall of 1987, included the three new wings and a\npreviously designed baseline wing. The A488 analysis had predicted how the four wings would rank with\nrespect to each other at the design cruise point. The wind tunnel test results confirmed the A488 predictions.\nThe new wings were approximately 10% thicker than the baseline wing, but delivered the same drag level\nand drag divergence Mach capability. There were differences in details that the codes were not able to\npredict, so further refinement of the computational methods is still desirable. The wind tunnel was, of course,\nable to give information over a wider range of conditions than CFD. This endeavor was a success and was\ncarried out in a very short period of time because of the skill of the responsible project engineers, and because\nthe necessary tools were in place. No new code development or validation was necessary. However, several\ndesirable enhancements to A488 and A555 were identified from the experience. They are being incorporated\ninto the codes to further improve their usability and accuracy.\n\n,\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\nCFD is a n integral part of the aerodynamic design process at Boeing. Together with the wind tunnel,\ndesigns are now being developed in a timely manner that was not previously possible. That is the role of CFD\nin industry.\n\nI\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis paper is based in part on work conducted for the Boeing Independent Research and Development\nProgram.
