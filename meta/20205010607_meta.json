NASA\u2019s STARC\u2013ABL concept uses an electri- cally powered BLI tail cone thruster on what is otherwise a traditional airframe. Despite the traditional airframe of this configuration, aeropropulsive integration is critical to the perfor- mance of the BLI propulsor. Furthermore, due to being electrically powered, the fan pressure ratio and efficiency of the BLI tail cone thruster vary widely across the flight envelope, and this variation in fan performance must be accounted for with the aeropropulsive integration of the BLI system. Thus, accurate performance prediction for this novel propulsion configu- ration requires the use of a coupled aeropropulsive model across the flight envelope. In this work, we analyze the off-design performance of 18 optimized designs using an aeropropulsive model that is built with the OpenMDAO framework to couple 3-D RANS CFD simulations to 1-D thermodynamic cycle analyses. The designs are created via high-fidelity aeropropulsive design optimizations that span a range of fan pressure ratio and thrust values at the cruise conditions for the STARC-ABL concept, which was chosen as the aerodynamic design point for the propulsor. Performance analyses we present herein are then performed at a range of off-design flight conditions that span the flight envelope, including low-speed and low-altitude flight conditions. This study provides the first set of high-fidelity data for the STARC\u2013ABL configuration at off-design conditions, and the results quantify the power savings through BLI compared to a traditional propulsion system across the entire mission profile.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "US", "submissionId": 20205010607, "endDate": "2021-01-15T05:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"organizationId": "71fb4af96d4a59b5a0a2084db7b4ce35", "meta": {"organization": {"name": "American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics", "location": "Reston, Virginia, United States"}}, "meetingId": "dd30c6fd6ad0436387d86e3e0ce6a919", "id": "05e85a77852e4a40b1594080905d6ad6"}], "name": "AIAA SciTech Forum 2021", "location": "Virtual", "id": "dd30c6fd6ad0436387d86e3e0ce6a919", "url": "https://www.aiaa.org/SciTech", "startDate": "2021-01-11T05:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "scitech2021_aeroprop (3).pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20205010607/downloads/scitech2021_aeroprop%20(3).pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20205010607/downloads/scitech2021_aeroprop%20(3).pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20205010607/downloads/scitech2021_aeroprop%20(3).pdf.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
