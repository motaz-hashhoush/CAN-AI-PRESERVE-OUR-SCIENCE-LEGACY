Impacts by small meteoroids are common on satellite surfaces, but impacts by meteoroids large enough to damage well designed systems are very rare. Estimating the threat from the normal meteoroid environment is difficult. Estimates for the occasional \"storm\" are even more uncertain. Common sense precautions are in order for the 1999 Leonids, but wide-spread catastrophic damage is highly unlikely. Strong Leonid showers are also expected in 2000 and 2001, but these pose much less threat than 1999.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 19990041159, "name": "VISTA User''s Conference", "location": "Atlanta, GA", "id": "1e515afa72c9413da39cddb067a30d71"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 19990041159, "id": "ae205085c1e845b0bc3ede403e35fd73", "publicationDate": "1999-04-20T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19990041159.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19990041159/downloads/19990041159.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19990041159/downloads/19990041159.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19990041159/downloads/19990041159.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
