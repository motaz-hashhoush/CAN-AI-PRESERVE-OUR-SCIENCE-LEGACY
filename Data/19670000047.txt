Some data for the evaluation of fluid tensile\nstrength characteristics is available in the 10 3 to 104\nreciprocal seconds area, but the behavior of fluids in\nthe range of 106 reciprocal seconds is not established\nas a design criterion although some dynamic seals may\noperate at this level of shear rate.\nThe solution:\nA study that results in. specific design criteria in\nsealing applications for continuous duty pumps in\nvarious applications. A basic sealing equation is\ndeveloped to predict visco seal performance in the\nturbulent regime.\nHow it\'s done:\nData is produced to indicate the most favorable\ngeometry for the highest sealing effectiveness for a\ngiven set of operating parameters. The visco seal is\na noncontacting dynamic seal that uses fluid viscous\nforces to accomplish the sealing function. It essentially is a "screw pump" operating at zero flow\nagainst a pressure differential (pressure to be sealed).\nThe conventional configuration is a threaded shaft\nmember consisting of helical lands operating within\na close tolerance sleeve. Considering the numerous\ngeometric and hydrodynamic parameters of interest,\na generalized sealing equation suitable for computer\nevaluation is evolved. This permits variation of the\nvisco seal design for optimization in a broad field of\napplications. Results of the computer study show that\ngood performance is obtainable over a wide range of\ngeometric variables. It is specifically established that\n\nfor a given helix angle, there is a particular value of\nthe nondimensional clearance that maximizes the nondimensional sealing coefficient. In general, the\noptimum value of the nondimensional clearance shifts\nvery gradually towards lower values as the Reynolds\nnumber increases. The maximum value of the nondimensional sealing coefficient is relativel y constant\nover a wide range, increasing slightly towards the\narea of smaller helix angles.\nNotes:\n1. These design criteria should be of interest to\ndesigners of boiler feed pumps, process plant\npumps, or refinery pumps continuously transferring\nliquids in both the laminar and turbulent regimes.\n2. Other design consideration, such as correlation of\ntheory and experiment, gas ingestion, end effects,\nand scavenging, are discussed in the following\nreferences:\nA.
