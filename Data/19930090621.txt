We are not quite\ncertain what is the exact meaning of this word, or whether it\nhas any meaning, in German, but from the size of the seaplane\nto which it is applied it would appear reasonable to assume\nthat it is the equivalent of the English "Roc," described by\nWebster as "A fabulous mythical bird of Arabia."\nIn its general design-:. and construction, the Rohrbach\n"Rocco" is similar to the series of seaplanes previously designed by Dr. Rohrbach, but the effect of evolution is traceable in the design. Thus, in place of the constant-chord,\nconstant-section wings of the early Rohbach, the wings of the\n"Rocco" have tapered tips. Fundamentally, however, the new\nseaplane is typically Rohr\'oach, with a monoplane wing surmounted by two engines, a flat-sided. narrow beam hull steadied when\non the water by two outboard wing floats. A large dihedial\nangle is a feature of the design, this doubtless being a result\nof the high position of the engines.\n*From Flight, May 12, 1927.\n\nN.A.C.A. Aircraft Circular No. 44\t\n\n2\n\nConstructional Features\nAs in the case of earlier Rohbach seaplanes, the Rocco"\nis of all-metal constructioit,. the term "all-metal" in this\ncase being synonymous with duralumin construction, which is the\nmaterial used exclusively with the exception of a few wing fittings and bracing struts, which are of steel. A feature of\nRohrbach construction is that the covering or skin, is designed\nas a stress bearing part of the general structure. This applies,\nof course, to seaplane hulls in general, but in the case of the\nRohrbach seaplanes, it also applies to the wings, which are co y\n-erd.withs uralmifongprt hewingbox.Ts\nwing box may be considered as one very large spar, extending\nfrom tip to tip of the wing and, in a fore and aft direction,\nvery roughly half-way in the wing chord to a short distance\naft o the leading edge. \xe2\x80\xa2This wing box is built up in the\nform of a front and rear member corresponding approximately to\nthe front and rear spars in more orthodox types of construction, joined at intervals by fore and aft bulkheads or formers,\nthe skin being riveted to both spars and farmers. In addition,\nthe thickness of the skin varies from point to point in the\nwing according to local stresses, the change being effected\npartly by using sheet duralumim of different gauges and partly\nby laination\nThe more or less closed box constructioir o\xc2\xb1 the Rohrbach\nwing has necessitated a somewhat unusual arrangement of\n\nN.A.C.A. Aircraft Circular No. 44\n\n\t\n\n0\n\nthe leading and trailing edges. These are hinged to front and\nrear spar at short intervals, and are attached in such a manner\nthat by undoing a number of small bolts the leading and trailing edges can be swung up or down in such a manner as to enable\nan inspection of the interior of the wing box, or even minor\nrepairs; Also, should any sea water get inside the wings, in\ntaxying in a very rough sea, for instance, the water can be\ndrained out, and 1 cad. in g nd t railing ed ge s opened so as to enable air to get at the interior of the wing and dry up a.ny water\nthat may have collected in out-of-the-way corners.\nThe seaplane hull is of the flat-sided variety, this form\nevidently having been chosen in order to avoid as far as possible the somewhat expensive panel beating which is necessary\nwhere sheet material has to be bent over a double curvature.\nA exception is formed by the planing bottom of the Iill,\nwhich, in the latest type of Rohrbach, is of pronounced \'VII\nformation, the flat-bottomed. hulls of the earlier Rohrbachs\nhaving, we believe, given a certain amount of trouble owing to\nleakage a.s a result of hard landings. There are two steps, in\nthe hull, as in most modern seaplanes, the steps being of the\nclosed variety.\nIn the detail construction of the hull, as well as in that\nof the wings, only flat sheet and open sections are iployed in\norder to afford cheap construction and ease of inspection.\nThus, it is claimed that no hidden rivets are found anywhere\n\nN.A.C.A. Aircraft Circular No. 44\n\n\t\n\n4\n\nin the structure, all riveting being open to inspection from\nboth sides. Furthermore, both during actual construction and\nin use later on the open sections employed render the operation\nof protecting the material against corrosion easier and more\ncertain. A number of bulkheads divide the seaplane hull into\nwater-tight compartments, and all the doors in the cabin are so\nmade as to be water-tight when closed, t1s reducing the risk\nof sinking in case of damage in one compartment. It is even\nclaimed that the buoyancy of the hull is such that with all doors\nand windows closed the seaplane would remain afloat with two\nadjacent compartments damaged.\nA similar principle applies to the outboard wing floats,\nand as a safeguard against the seaplane turning over in case of\ndamage to wing float, the outer few feet of the wing itself\nhave been formed into water-tight boxes, so that if a wing\nfloat is punctured, and the seaplane begins to heel over, the\nwing tip ii1I meet the water, and by the buoyancy of the wing\ntip boxes, acting on a long lever arm, will effectively Drevent\nthe seaplane from turning right over, although it would naturally be over at a rather uncomfortable angle.\nHull Accommodation\nThe hull of the Rohrbach tRoccou is, as already mentioned,\ndivided into a number of compartments. The nose of the hull\nforms what is termed a "collision compartment," which is sepa-\n\nN.A.0.A. Aircraft Circular No. 44\t\n\n5\n\nrated from the rest of the hull by a water-tight bulkhead. In\nthis com partment is carried the gear for handling the seaplaie\non the water, such as anchor ropes, boat hooks, drogues, etc.\nThis collision compartment would protect the rest of the hull\nin case of accidental ramming of any obstacle resulting in a\nleak in the forward part of the hull.\nAft of the collision bulkhead is the pilot s s cockpit, in\nwhich are placed two seats side by side, and all the controls,\ninstruments, etc. Owing to the situation of the cockpit ahead\nof the wings, the view is particularly good in all directions,\nespeciliy as the hull is of relatively narrow beam.\nBehind the cockpit is the wireless compartment, which has\na length of 0.92 m (3 ft.) and. a width of 1.5 m (4 ft. 11 in.).\nIn addition to the wireless outfit, table, seat, etc., this\ncompartment also contains the auxiliary engine, which is so arranged as to reduce the noise of it to a minimum, by being\nhoused inside a soundproof compartment. The auxiliary engine\nis a Bristol gas starter which, in addition to its main furction of starting the engines, is also employed for driving the\nelectric generator and the bilge pumps.\nThe saloon has a. length of 6.8 rn (22 ft. 4 in.) and a width\nof 1.7 m (5 ft. 7 in.), and there is ample head room for standing upright throughout. A water-tight bulkhead divides the\nsaloon into two separate compartments with a water-tight central\ndoor giving communication between the two. The forward compart-\n\nN.A.C.A. Aircraft Circular No. 44 \t\n\n6\n\nment has accommodation for four passengers and the aft one for\nsix. Entrance \'to the saloon is through a hatchway in the deck\nof the hull at the aft end of the saloon. The saloon is covered\nwith leather and other material which is so arranged as to a\'osorb a considerable amount of the noise from the engines. The\nseats have adjustable back-rests and are claimed to be extremely\ncomfortable. The windows of the saloon are in the form of\nround portholes and like the various doors and, hatch covers,\nare so made as to be water-tight when closed. The saloon. s\nwell-ventilated and heated and by each passenger\'s seat there\nis an electric light. Aft of the cabin is a lavatory and aft of\nthat again is the luggage and goods com p artment, which is entered through a hatch in the deck, and which measures 1. 5 m\n(4 ft. 11 in.) in length, with an average width of 1.3 m (4 ft.\n3 in.). Special provision has been made for lashing the luggage in such a way as to prevent it from shifting.\nPowe\' Plant\nThe engines used. in the Rohrbch \'Rocco\' are Rolls-Royce\ntl Condors u Series III, of 650 HP. each. They are supported on\ntubular structures above the wing and neatly cowled in. It is\nclaimed that with this high position of the engines, the tractor airecrews are well clear of any spray that might be thrown\nup in a rough sea. Behind the engines and inside the cowling\nare the two oil tanks, while the gasoline tanks form the leading\n\nN.A.C.A.
