b'BACKGROUND\nThe pupil system\n\nAssessing visual delays using pupil oscillations\n\nThe pupil and cognition\n\nJeffrey B. Mulligan, NASA Ames Research Center\n\nThe pupil: more than just light adaptation\n\nResults: Oscillations produced by delayed feedback\nMore results: white noise analysis\n\nABSTRACT\nStark (1962) demonstrated vigorous pupil oscillations by illuminating the retina with a beam of light focussed to a\nsmall spot near the edge of the pupil. Small constrictions of the pupil then are sufficient to completely block the\nbeam, amplifying the normal relationship between pupil area and retinal illuminance. In addition to this simple\nand elegant method, Stark also investigated more complex feedback systems using an electronic "clamping box"\nwhich provided arbitrary gain and phase delay between a measurement of pupil area and an electronically\ncontrolled light source. We have replicated Stark\'s results using a video-based pupillometer to control the\nluminance of a display monitor. Pupil oscillations were induced by imposing a linear relationship between pupil\narea and display luminance, with a variable delay. Slopes of the period-vs-delay function for 3 subjects are close to\nthe predicted value of 2 (1.96-2.39), and the implied delays range from 254 to 376 508 to 652 milliseconds. Our\nsetup allows us to extend Stark\'s work by investigating a broader class of stimuli.\n\nFigure from Barbur & Stockman chapter in Encyclopedia of the Eye (2010)\n\nDilation: sympathetic nervous system (fight or flight)\n\nFigure from Kahneman, Peavler & Onuska (1968)\n\nPupil pattern responses\nPupil color response\n\nPupil grating response\n\nBIG QUESTIONS:\nHow can we use pupil measurements to assess\noperator state (fatigue, alertness)?\nWhat are the effects of complex visual signals on\nthe pupil?\n\nFigure from Gray\'s Anatomy (1918)\n\nConstriction: parasympathetic nervous system (rest and digest)\n\nFigures from Barbur (2004)\n\nMelanopsin and ipRGC\'s\nSustained pupil response in macaque mimics activity of ipRGC\'s\nFigure captured from animated online demo at tedmontogomery.com\n\nStark\'s experiment (1962)\n\nTechnical Challenges\nState-related pupil changes are small, and may be swamped by other effects\nas well as random fluctuations. Challenges exist both in the measurement\nand interpretation of the signals. As can be seen in the upper right figure in\nthe panel to the leftt, the transient pupil dilation resulting from mental effort\nhas a peak amplitude of approximately half a millimeter.\n\nPupil oscillations were induced by stimulating the eye with a light intensity proportional to pupil area, with a variable delay. A simple control law\npredicts period-vs-delay slopes of 2, as seen in data from two subjects (above). Subject JBM (below) show two branches; the lower branch\n(predicted slope=2/3) occurs at longer delays when an unstable pupil becomes entrained with an extra cycle of phase delay. The upper left panel\nshows a 4 DOF fit in which the two branches are fit independently, while in the upper right panel the fits were constrained to share a common xintercept. The lower two panels show 1 DOF fits in which the slopes were constrained to the theoretical predictions, and only the x-intercept was\nfree to vary. The two lower panels show two replications, with a 5% discrepancy in their estimates of the internal delay.\n\nIn addition to replicating Stark\'s results using open-loop stimulation and delayed feedback, we\nare extending the use of white-noise analysis to the case of full-color stimuli, in the hope of\nidentifying a component due to ipRGC\'s with a different spectral and temporal signature. The\nfigure above shows the pupil response (upper black trace) to independent random signals\napplied to the red, blue and green components of a video screen (luminance shown in black).\nThis is a pilot experiment intended to demonstrate proof-of-concept; in order to produce a\nstimulus capable of independently stimulating the three cone photoreceptors, rods and\nipRGC\'s, a stimulator with at least 5 primaries will be required, perhaps by combining two\nvideo displays with different primaries using a beam-splitter.\n\nfirst component\n\nTechnical approach\nIn this work we seek to increase our understanding of the pupillary system\nusing system identification methods first applied in this context by Stark in\n1962. Stark studied the pupil by creating a situation in which the pupil system\nran \xe2\x80\x9copen loop,\xe2\x80\x9d by focussing a beam of light down to a small spot at the pupil,\nso that changes in pupil size did not influence the amount of light falling on the\nretina (see lower left figures on panel to the left) . We accomplished a similar\neffect by using a real-time video pupillometer to control the intensity of a video\ndisplay.\n\nfirst component\n\nsecond component\n\nthird component\n\nThe data were analyzed by cross-correlating the response with the projection of the stimulus in a variety of color directions.\nPrinciple Components Analysis (PCA) was then applied to the tableau of resulting kernels. Because the inherent\ndimensionality of the stimulus space is 3, only the first 3 components have eigenvalues that are larger than the noise floor.\nThese are shown above; the phosphor loadings on the first component correspond to the luminance direction, while the\nsecond two components appear to soak up the rest of the noise without displaying any clear causality. The latency of the peak\nof the first component is in good agreement with the estimate obtained from the period-vs-delay functions.\nFigures from Gamlin et al. (2007)\n\nConclusion\n\nMelanopsin action spectrum from sustained pupil response in human\n\nDisappointingly, we failed to observe pupil oscillations when using delayed feedback to control grating contrast (rather\nthan luminance), although the efforts to date fall somewhat short of heroic. Similarly, to date the extended white noise\nanalysis has not revealed mechanisms beyond the basic luminance input to the pupil system. Given the extremely long\nsustained response seen in ipRGC\'s, this method may not be the most efficient.\nReferences\nBarbur, JL and Stockman, A (2010) Photopic, Mesopic, and Scotopic Vision and Changes in Visual Performance.
