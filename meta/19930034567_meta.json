Based on the above observation, a flat-front model for an approximate analytical solution is proposed. A closed-form solution related to the temperature distribution in the hot zone and the hot zone length as a function of time are obtained. The analytical results agree well with the corresponding experimental data, and provide a quick prediction method for the heat pipe startup performance. Finally, a heat pipe limitation related to the frozen startup process is identified, and an explicit criterion for the high-temperature heat pipe startup is derived. The frozen startup limit identified in this paper provides a fundamental guidance for high-temperature heat pipe design.", "title": "Closed-form analytical solutions of high-temperature heat pipe startup and frozen startup limitation", "stiType": "REPRINT", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-15T23:47:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19930034567, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Cao, Y."}, "organization": {"name": "NASA Lewis Research Center", "location": "Cleveland, OH, United States"}}, "id": "fe682eb838bb4b8dbbc3d0d83fc6d660"}, {"sequence": 1, "submissionId": 19930034567, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Faghri, A."}, "organization": {"name": "Wright State Univ.", "location": "Dayton, OH, United States"}}, "id": "a7750aefb89649f6a36cbafd8020b09e"}], "disseminated": "METADATA_ONLY", "stiTypeDetails": "Reprint (Version printed in journal)", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2011-08-19T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19930034567, "publications": [{"volume": "114", "submissionId": 19930034567, "issue": "4", "issn": "0022-1481", "id": "89c822e3779a4f1ca6cbea1af4c934ce", "publicationName": "ASME, Transactions, Journal of Heat Transfer", "publicationDate": "1992-11-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [], "downloadsAvailable": false, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
