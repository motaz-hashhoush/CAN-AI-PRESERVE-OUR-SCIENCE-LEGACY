The satellite\'s\nAerojet SVM-7 Apogee Kick Motor will be fired roughly three days after launch\n(seventh apogee) to circularize the satellite orbit at a geosynchronous a\'titude of\n36,000 KM above the equator with zero inclination. The satellite hydrazine gas system\nwill be utilized to then draft the satellite to 109 degree west longitude near the\nAnik -AI (Telesat-A) satellite whose function it will replace into the 1980\'s with its\nexpected seven year lifetime.\nThe Telesat-E and -F (Anik-C 1 and -C2) missions are scheduled for launch on the\nSpace Shuttle in 1981 to replace the function of the Anik-A2 and -A3 (Telesat-B,\nand -C) satellites,\nThe Anik-11 will provide point-to-point voice, TV, and data communications traffic\nto Canada\'s ten provinces,\n\nIn addition to its 12 commercial channels in the 6 and 4 gigaHertz frequency bands,\nAnik-B has foi- channels for operation at the 12 and 14 gigaHertz frequencies.\nThe full capacity of the satellite\'s higher frequency bands will be leased to Canada\'s\nDepartment of Communications for two years with an option for two additional year\'s\nuse. These channels will be used for a series of 14 pilot projects which stem from the\nCommunications Technology Satellite (CTS), a joint U.S.-Canadian experimental\nsote I I ite.\nIncluded in these projects are social experiments such as TeleMedicirie, TeleEducation,\nTeleConferencing, and Eskimo Broadcasting all intended to further evaluate the use\nof satellites for reuching remote locations equipped with small ground stations.\nOther, purely technical projects are designed to produce experimental information\nabout such subjects as signal propagation as well as power generation and usoge.\nControl of the Anik-B will be transferred to Telesat\'s Satellite Control Center,\nheadquartered in Ottawa, after separation from the Delta vehicle. Tracking, transmission, and reception of data will be provided by the Telesat Earth station near\nAllan Park, Ontario, about 130 km (80 miles) wes^ of Toronto.\n11%30-78\t\n\nPage 3\n\nM-492-201-78-04\n\nSPACECRAFT DESCRIPTION\n\nThe Telesat-D spacecraft is designed for Telesot Canada\'s Domestic Communications\nSatellite System to provide communications coverage for nil of Canada in the 6/4 GHz\nand 14/12 GHz bands. The satellite configuration, shown in Figure 1, is such that it\nhas a length of 128.3 inches including antennae (44 inches excluding antennae) and\na diameter of 85.6 inches. The spacecraft weighs 1956 pounds in transfer orbit. The\nspacecraft contains an Apogee Kick Motor which is fired at the apogee of the transfer\n01bit to wduc,\xc2\xb0 the inclination t- zero and place the spacecraft in u 24-hour e qu a torial\ngeodtoti,x,cny orbit. After some preliminary maneuvers, the spacecraft performs\na dual-spin turn by energizing its momentum wheel, deploys the solar panels, and\nlocks onto the Earth with its pitch control loop. The satellite weight at that tirne has\nbeen reduced to 1045 pounds by the burning of the AKM.\n\nTELESAT-D (ANIh-a) SATELLITt ZONFIGURATION\n\nINCLINATION\nCONTROL\nTHRUSTERS\n14 ON NORTH\nSIDE ONLY)\n\nTHE RM^\nRAOIAT\n\nSYN OR\nOMNI A\n14,12 G\nFEED\n\nLONGITUDE\nCONTROL\nTHRUST[ RS\n(4 ON EAST SIDE)\n(40N WEST SIDE)\n\nHORNS\n\n14!12 G P\nREFLEC\nHYDRAZINE\nTANKS\n\n64 GHr\nR1 FLEC\nLAUNC \xe2\x96\xba\n\nPASSIVE\nNUTATION\nDAMPER\n\nOMNI\n\nANTLNP\nd/4 GHz\n\nFEED Hi\n\nNORTH\n\nHIFOLD\n\nARRAY\n\nFig. 1\nThe Telesat-D satellite is a communications transponder designed for use in geostationary\norbit approximately 19,000 nautical miles (. 35,787 km) above the Earth\'s equator. Once\non station, an anboard hydrazine mono-propellant propulsion system is used to maintain\nthe satellite\'s position to within 0.05 degree North and South latitudes and 0.05 degree\n\n11/30/78\t\n\nPage 4\n\nM-492-201-78-04\n\nEast and West longitudes by means of ground-generated commands. The communications\nsubsystem uses 0 he 500 MHz, 6/4 GHz common-carrier band, and the 500 MHz,\n14/12 Gri. \xe2\x80\xa2 communications band.\nThe 6/4 GHz antenna covers Canada (see Figure 2) with 36 dBW effective isotropic\nradiated power (EIRP), horizontally polarized, of 4 GHz. On the uplink at 6 GHz,\nthe antenna provides the some coverage with a minimum of G/T of -6 dB/\'O K. The\n14/12 GHz antenna covers Conodo with four spot beams, West, Central West, Central\nEast, and East, radiating 46.5 dBW EIRP, horizontally polarized at 12 GHz. On the\nuplink, the antenna provides all Canada coverage at 14 GHz with a G/T of -1 dB,/*oK.\nTYPICAL GEOGRAPHICAL COVERAGE OF THE TELESAT-D\nSATELLITE AT 109 OW LONGITUDE\n416 Got\nX dB1Y\n\n4\n\nS1 1 TINS\n\nAIIFA\nON\nYORK\n\n\\\n\nFig. 2\nThe Telesat-D spacecraft has seven functional subsystems:\nCommand, Ranging, and Telemetry (CRBT)\nPower\nPropulsior (apogee kick motor and reaction control)\nAttitude Control\nThermal Control\nCommunications (transponder and antenna)\nStructure\na) Command, Ran g i ng, and Telemetry Subsystem - The Command, Ranging, and\nTelemetry (CR 8T) subsystem provides: the command link with the ground stations for\n\n11/30/78\n\n6\xe2\x80\x94\n\n\t\n\nPage 5\n\nM-492-201-78-04\n\ncontrolling the spacecraft; a transponder for ranging by connecting the output of the\ncommand receiver to the input of the telemetry beacon; and a telemetry subsystem for\nmonitoring the status and health of the spacecraft.\nSubsystem - The Power Subsystem consists of the following: 75 square feet\nb) Power_\nx.95 squmeters) of solar array for con.erting solar energy into electrical energy;\nthe power supply electronics (PSE) for ch jing the batteries and limiting the maximum\nbus voltage (it contains the battery reconditioning circuitry); the three nickel-cadmium,\n17 ampere-hour batteries for storing the energy for use in the eclipse periods; and\nthe solar-array-drive mechanism for rotating the solar array once a day.\nc) Propulsion Subsystem - The Propulsion Subsystem consists of an Aerojet SVM-7\nsold fueTapogee kick motor (AKM) and the reaction control subsystem (RCS). The\nsolid-propellant AKM is designed to provide the final orbit insertion and is an\nintegral part of the spacecraft. T he AKM has a length of 56.9 inches, diameter of\n30 inches, weighs 974 pounds, initially. and 63 pounds after burnout, a specific\nimpulse of 294, thrust of 9800 pounds for 27.8 seconds. The hydrazine-monoprooellarrt\nRCS system is designed to provide spe- craft control for spin-axis \xc2\xad ientation, orbitinjection-error correction, and on-orbit stationkeeping and attitude control. The\nspacecraft is required to maintain orbital position to within 0.05\' in both latitude\nand longitude. The largest propellant requirement is for out-of-plane north-iouth\ndrift correction that is required primarily because of l unar and solar gravitational\ndisturbances. A much smaller propellant requirement is associated with the east-west\ndrift caused by Earth-asphericity and solar-pressure disturbances. All of these\ncorrections are performed by direct ground command of the propulsion subsystem.\nd) Attitude Control Subsystem - A single body-mounted momentum wheel provide- full\nthree -axis contro by virtue of the gyroscopic rigidity of the wheel and its servocontrolled exchange of angular momentum with the spacecraft main body. The\ninertial stability permits attitude Determination by a single roll/pitch Earth-horizon\nsensor without the complexity of a yaw gyro or star sensor. Continuous control of\nthe pitch axis alignment to the Orbit normal is achieved using magnetic torquing\nwith no expendables or moving parts. Al; active components of the subsystem,\nincluding the momentum wheel, have standby spares to eliminate single-point failure\nmodes.\nThe Attitude Control Subs y stem consists functionally of:\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Pitch control with active nutation damping,\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Magnetic roll/yaw control with backup thruster control,\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Roll/yaw control with thrusters during orbit -rdjust, and\n\xe2\x80\xa2 Attitude sensing equipment.\n\n11/30/78\n\nk_\xe2\x80\x94\n\n\t\n\nPage 6\n\nM-492-201-78-04\n\ne) Thermal Control Subsystem - The Thermal Control Subsystem uses heater-augmented\npassive t ermol\t co ntrol. The passive surface finish and rnsuiation elements of tfie\nSubsystem accommodate the seasonal or orbit variations in solar inputs, while the\nheaters compensate for the wide range of internal dissipation due to the number of\ntransponder channels in operation and the state of the eleoricol power subsystem.\nf) Communications Subsystem - The \'.ommunications S, bsystem consists of three\ncomponents: the antenna assemblies, the tronspondt,-s, and the power and telemetry\nconditioner (PTC).\nThe ontenno-. ore arranged on the spacecraft Eorth-facing panel (antenna panel) and\nconsist of two sepero+e systems. One system )perates in the 6/4 GHz bond and the\nother operates in the 14,12 GHz bond. Each has separate feed towers and reflectors.\nThe 6/4 (-,Hz antenna has three feed horns and provides complete Canadian coverage\non the up and down links. The 14/12 antenna has four feed horns and provides full\nCanadian coverage on the uplink and has four separate beams on the downlink\ncalled West, Central West, Central East, and East. The path a signal takes is a\nfunction of its frequency and the position of switches on the spacecraft.\ng) Structure - Two opposing equipmen+ panels support most of the internal spacecraft\ncomponents, and are joined at the i, upper and lower ends by the antenna panel and\nthe baseplate. The box structure is completed by a pair of opposing cover panels\nthrough which the propellant tanks partially protrude. A. conical adapter extends\ndownward from the baseplate and terminates in a separation ring which mates with\nthe Marmon clamp joint of the Delta 3731A adapter. An internal conical structure\nextends upward from the separation ring and provides support for the apogee kick motor .\nThe equipment and antenna panels are of honeycomb construction, utilizing\naluminum-alloy skins and core. The baseplate is aluminum honeycomb on an aluminum\nbeam grid, and serves as a transition structure between the spacecraft box shape and\nconical adapter. Stiff beams near the ends of the baseplate provide for attachment of\nthe adapter cone and are the baseplate\'s principal structural elements. The other\nbaseplate members provide local load paths, beam stability, and skin stiffening.\n\n11 , 10/78\n\t\n\nPage 7\n\n\t\n\nM-492-201-78-U4\n\nLAUNCH VEHICLE DESCRIPTION\nThe Telesot -D spacecraft wall u: launched by the thrust-augmented NASA Delta 3914\nlaunch vehicle (Figures 3 and 4).

In the event of erratic flight, both systems will respond to the\nsome RF modulated signal sent by a ground transmitting system upon initiation by the\nRange Safety Officer.\nLAUNCH SUPPORT\nThe Eastern Test Range, the launch vehicle contractor, McDonnell -Douglas, and\nNASA will supply all personnel and equipment required to handle the assembly, prelaunch checkout, and launch of the Delta vehicle.\nTRACKING AND DATA SUPPORT\nETR Range stations will track the $ irst and second stages. Two ARIA aircraft will track\nand record data for second and third stage operations. A nominal orbit will be provided approximately 30 minutes after launch based on this data and the assumption\nthat the third stage was nominal.\n"he Apogee Kick is ;,tor (AKM) firing 3 days after liftoff will be controlled from the\n, Vlesot central ground station at Allan Park, Ontario near Toronto, which is responsible\nfor all tracking and data recovery activities after the spacecraft reaches transfer orbit.\nLovnch vehicle tracking as well as early orbit spacecraft tracking will be provided by\nNASA\'s Space Tracking and Data Network (STDN) with all spacecraft data sent simultaneously to Telesat/Canada.\n\n11,/30/78\t\n\nPage 15\n\nM-492-201-78-04\n\nDELTA/TELESAT -D LAUNCH TEAM\nNASA HEADQUARTERS\nJohn F.
