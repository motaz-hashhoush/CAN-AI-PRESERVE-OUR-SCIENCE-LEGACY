These would be used to do Orbital Replacement Unit (ORU) exchanges, inspection of the components, and in certain cases subsystem assembly. By performing these well-definded tasks automatically, higher crew productivity would be achieved. In order to utilize the robots effectively, ORU's must be designed to allow remote release and quick disconnection of the electrical, fluid, and thermal connections. The robot must be of a modular design for ease of maintenance and must have an adaptive control capability to make-up for slight errors in programming.", "title": "Dedicated robotic servicing for the space station", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PAPER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-09-06T00:06:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19890017090, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Thompson, R.
