Most\ndesign and construction practices\nused today have been developed and\nrefined over many years to enable\ndesigners and builders to provide\nhomes in a wide variety of designs\nand sizes at a reasonable cost. The\ncurrent consumer awareness of energy\nshortages and limited natural resources is providing an additional\nchallenge to the industry to apply\nappropriate new technology as rapidly\nas is economically feasible. Builders\nand manufacturers, as well as the\nhomeowner, must strive for new concepts which require less energy and\nresources.\n\nIntroduction\nAs a homeowner you soon may be the\nbeneficiary of significant new technology, much of it coming from the\nnation\'s space program. New building\nmaterials, better use of existing energy\nas well as new uses of solar energy,\nwater conservation, fire-prevention\ntechniques, and a variety of household\nproducts are outgrowths of our national\ninvestment in the aerospace program.\nBuilders and manufacturers of\nhomes and housing equipment need\nnew methods and materials to survive\nin a highly competitive market. Probably the most significant opportunity\nfor change in houses over the next few\ndecades will be in energy management. Our homes consume about 20\npercent of the energy used in the\nUnited States each year\xe2\x80\x94an amount\nalmost equal to all imported crude oil.\nThe NASA Technology Utilization\nHouse, called Tech House, was designed and constructed at NASA\'s\nLangley Research Center in Hampton,\nVirginia, to demonstrate new technology that is available or will be\navailable in the next several years and\nhow the application of aerospace\ntechnology could help advance the\nhomebuilding industry. Solar energy\nuse, energy and water conservation,\nsafety, security, and cost were major\nconsiderations in adapting the aerospace technology to the construction\nof Tech House.\nA committee, comprised of representatives from the Department of\nHousing and Urban Development, the\nNational Association of Home Builders\nResearch Institute, the National Bureau\nof Standards, the Consumer Product\nSafety Commission, and NASA personnel, was formed for the purpose of\nidentifying new technology and guiding\nthe design of Tech House. In addition\nto this committee, NASA employed an\narchitectural engineering firm to\nperform system studies, evaluate proposed construction methods, perform\ncost effectiveness studies, and prepare\nfinal drawings incorporating technological outgrowths into Tech House\nconstruction.\nTech House is a single level structure of contemporary design, comprised of two square modules\nconnected by a flat-roofed hallway\ncontaining entry vestibules at the front\nand rear and a laundry room in the\nrear vestibule. It is expected to consume only about one-third the\nelectricity and one-half the water of\ncomparably-sized homes.\nThe equipment and materials in\nTech House are now on the market or\n\nwill be within five years. Properly\ninstalled, they could bring about reductions in the homeowner\'s utility bills\nfor heating, cooling, and water over a\n20-year period that would exceed their\ncost by some $20,000.\nWhile Tech House is not large, it is\nextremely functional and contains\napproximately 1500 square feet of\nenclosed living space consisting of\nthree bedrooms, living room with fireplace, dining area, kitchen, two bathrooms, and laundry room, plus an\nattached garage. It is expected that\nwithin 5 years the house, with all its\nspecial features, could be built commercially for approximately $50,000\n(in 1977 dollars) on an existing lot.\nHowever, this forecast is based on the\nmass production of components and is\nsubject to each homeowner\'s personal\npreferences and location.\nOne of the first steps in Tech House\nplanning was to determine energy\nconsumption requirements and how\ntotal energy could be reduced. This\nwas accomplished by analyzing\ndifferent types of ceilings, roofs, windows, doors, and insulations to\ndetermine which would be most energy\nefficient and cost effective. A system or\nproduct was considered "cost effective" if its added initial cost plus 10\npercent interest could be returned to\nthe buyer through energy or other\nsavings over the lifetime of that system.\nThe results of these studies, showing\na comparison of energy consumption\nin a contemporary house, electrically\nheated and constructed by 1974\nstandards, with energy consumption\nprojected for Tech House, follow:\nEnergy Consumption\nCentral heating\nCentral air conditioning\nWater heating\n\nLights\nAppliances\nMiscellaneous\nTotal\n\nContemporary\nHouse (KW-HR)\n\nTech House\n(KW-HR)\n\n29,300\n3,600\n4,380\n2,000\n5,609\n1,111\n46,000\n\n6,000\n2,100\n1,500\n1,000\n3,400\n1,000\n15,000\n(Approx.\n66% reduction)\n\nA study which had previously been\nconducted by NASA determined that a\nsignificant reduction in domestic water\nconsumption could be achieved by\nrecycling waste water for toilet flush\nand using recently developed water\n\nsaving fixtures, such as water saver\nshower heads and low profile water\nclosets. The following comparative\nfigures were based on that study:\nWater Consumption\n(Fora Family of Four;\nExcluding Lawn Watering)\n\nA complete set of drawings and\nspecifications of Tech House may be\nordered for $10 from:\n\nTotal\n\nTech House\n(Gallons)\n\n22,265\n2,920\n5,840\n\nBathing\nDishwashing\nLaundry\nCleaning\nToilet\nMiscellaneous\n\nContemporary\nHouse (Gals.)\n\n16,480\n2,190\n\n2,190\n32,485\n7,300\n73,000\n\nWhile the reduction in energy and\nwater consumption represents considerable savings in utility costs, it is\nimportant to note that additional\nsavings can result from fire-resistant\nconstruction and solar energy usage.\nThe use of fire-resistant carpets,\ndrapes, furniture covers, insulation,\nand other materials can result in lower\nfire insurance rates, and many states\nencourage the use of solar energy by\nproviding tax-break incentives for\nhomeowners.\nThe safety and security of the\nhomeowner\'s family also were considered in choosing products to be\ninstalled in Tech House. Therefore,\nadvanced security detectors for protection against fire, smoke, and intruders were incorporated in its\nconstruction.\nIt should be pointed out that energyconserving homes are most efficient\nwhen carefully designed to fit specific\nsites with their particular characteristics of access, orientation to sun and\nwinds, history of weather conditions,\nand thermal requirements. For this\nreason, Tech House was not intended\nto be, and should not be, considered a\nprototype or mass-producible design\nsuitable for all locations. Instead, Tech\nHouse should be viewed as a demonstration model and research facility\ncontaining many individual systems,\ncomponents, products, and ideas\nwhich can be applied in some degree\nto all housing.\n\n5,840\n2,190\n0\n7,300\n34,000\n(Approx.\n50% reduction)\n\nNorth Carolina Science and\nTechnology Research Center\nP.O.

Eighteen 3x8-foot solar\ncollectors (16 for home heating, 2 for\nwater heating) are mounted at an angle\nof 58 degrees on the south-facing roof\nof Tech House, providing maximum\nexposure to Virginia\'s winter Sun. (The\nmost efficient solar collector angle\ndepends upon the latitude where the\nhouse is located.)\nThe glass of the solar collectors acts\nlike a one-way valve, admitting light\nand other solar radiation but trapping\nheat reflected from the interior. This\nso-called greenhouse effect is commonly experienced when leaving a\nclosed car in sunlight.\nWater passing through the collectors\ncarries the heat to the building heating\nsystem. A heat exchanger transfers\nthe heat from the water to ducts that\ndistribute the warm air throughout the\nhouse.\nIf heat is not required, the hot water\nfrom the collectors is diverted into a\n1900-gallon underground thermal\nstorage tank. Hot water is circulated\nfrom the tank to the heat exchanger at\nnight and during cloudy periods to\nprovide required heating. The tank\nstores sufficient heat for as long as\n31/2 consecutive overcast days.\n\nIf a longer stretch of overcast days\noccurs, the heat in the storage tank\nmay drop below 90 F. In this case,\nthe water from the storage tank is\nused to supply an electric heat pump\nto heat the house. If skies are overcast\nfor some 5 to 7 days and the temperature in the tank drops below 55 F, two\ndeep wells with water at about 55 F\nare used to supply water to the heat\npump. Supplying the heat pump with\npreheated water reduces the amount of\nelectricity needed to heat the house. A\nheat pump heats by extracting heat\nfrom air, the outside air, or a reservoir\nof water and pumping the heat into\nthe house.\n\nAir Conditioning\n\ntemperature control, large attic louvers,\nthe availability of cool water for the\nheat pump, and night radiators.\nThe solar collector system used for\nheating the house is cut off during the\nsummer. The main heat pump transfers\nheat from the house to the well water.\nIf the heat load exceeds the capacity of\nthe main pump, the auxiliary heat\npump, using cool water from the\nstorage tank, assists in cooling the\nhouse.\nAt night, the water in the storage\ntank is circulated through night radiators facing north on the garage roof.\nThe radiators radiate the heat from the\nwater to the outside air, reducing the\ntemperature of water in the tank.\n\nFor air conditioning, the heat pump\nextracts heat from the house and ejects\nthe heat into the air or a reservoir of\ncool water. Tech House is air conditioned by the heat pump but uses\nonly about half the electricity for air\nconditioning that is consumed in\ncomparably sized conventional homes.\nThe reduction in the air conditioning\nload is due to better insulation in the\nwalls and ceiling, shielding windows\nfrom direct summer sunlight, area\n\nDIRECT DUCT\nHEAT EXCHANGER\n\nMAIN\nHEAT PUMP\n\nHEATING/\nCOOLING DUCT\n\nSUPPLY\nWELL\n\nSimplified diagram of heating and cooling system.\n\nRETURN\nWELL\n\nArea Temperature\nControls\nheated additionally, if needed. This\nsystem decreases electricity usage for\nhot water heating by about 75 percent.\nThe solar collector system for hot water\noperates year round to provide for\nlaundry, bath, shower and sinks. The\nwater in the solar collectors circuit is\nmixed with automobile antifreeze to\npreclude possible freezing, just as is\ndone to prevent freeze-up of the family\ncar.\n\nInside temperatures are monitored and\ncontrolled by area by a computer\nsystem in accordance with the family\'s\nnormal activities. Only those areas in\nuse are heated or cooled. For example,\nin winter, the system would keep living\nareas warm and bedrooms cool during\nthe day. It would keep the bedrooms\nwarm and turn down the heat in the\nliving areas after bedtime. This zone\ncontrol system contributes significantly\nto energy efficiency. If the computer\nmalfunctions, it returns temperature\ncontrol to conventional thermostats.\n\nSmaller preheat tank sits beside\nconventional hot water tank.\n\nSolar Hot Water System\nTwo of the 18 solar collectors mounted\non the Tech House roof provide solarheated water which is circulated into\na preheat tank coil to heat incoming\ncity water. This exchange of heat raises\nthe temperature of the city water to\nabout 140 F at the inlet of the main\nwater heater tank. In the conventional\nelectric water heater tank the water is\n\nCITY WATER SUPPLY\n\nHOT WATER\nSUPPLY\n\nSOLAR COLLECTORS\n(48 SQ.

Although radiant heat\nis felt by people near the fireplace,\nmost of the heat, which is convective,\nsweeps up the chimney.\nBut the Tech House fireplace is\ndesigned to eliminate waste of room\nheat and to direct a much greater share\nof fireplace heat into the home. A duct\nsystem under the floor of the house\nsupplies outside air rather than already\nheated room air to the open hearth for\ncombustion. Low ducts on each side\nof the fireplace draw room air into\nthem. The room air circulates through\na double-walled firebox which raises\nthe temperature of the air. The additionally heated room air then returns\nto the living room through grills above\nthe fireplace.\nThe major fireplace contributor to\nhouse heating, however, is the special\nfireplace grate which is part of the\nmain heating system. The grate is a\ncoil through which water is circulated.\n\nThe heated water can either be delivered to the air duct heat exchanger\nto help heat the house or returned to\nthe underground hot water storage\ntank. All of the above features are\nexpected to increase fireplace efficiency from the usual 10 to more than\n50 percent.\nThe water grate system used in Tech\nHouse is available commercially, can\nbe installed in existing fireplaces, and\nis adaptable to hot water, forced air,\nor electrically heated systems. Tests of\nan earlier model fabricated at Langley\nshowed that it increased heating\nefficiency of the fireplace to 47 percent.\n\nHOT WATER\nOUTLET\nCOLD WATER\nINLET\nFireplace grate\n\n=\n\nOUBLEWALL\nFIREBOXC\n\nWARM AIR\nVv\nOUTLET\n\n!\n\n-4\n^\ni\nI\n\nf=\n\ni \xc2\xab_\n\n1\n1\n\n1\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\nBRICK\n\n1\n1\n\nNTAKE TO\nBLEWALL\n.BOX\n\n1\nf\n\n-\xe2\x80\x94\n\nINTAKE\n\n_4\n1-\n\n~~\n\n1\n\n=\n=f=\n-t-\n\nFLOOR\n\n1\n\n3\n\n1\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2h\nI\n\n1\n\n!\nL\nI\n\n.\n\n=7\n\nrJ\nI\n\nFireplace design\n\nROOM\nAIR\n\nr\\i\n\nT c-\n\nnc A ia\n\nIMT A k - p c\n\n1\n\n1\n\nFIREBRICK\nON SLAB\n\nWindows\nDirect sunlight streaming through the\nwindows of a house heats whatever\nobjects it strikes. These in turn give off\nheat that is trapped for a time inside\nof the house. Tech House utilizes this\nso-called greenhouse effect to best\nadvantage. A large window area on the\nsouth side permits the maximum\namount of direct sunlight to enter the\nhouse in wintertime. But a larger than\nnormal roof overhang protects the\nsouth-facing windows from direct sunlight during the summer. In addition,\n\nin summertime, windows facing west\nare covered with a reflective plastic\nsheeting that obstructs the Sun\'s rays.\nAll windows are double-paned for\ninsulation and a plastic material that\nhas low thermal conductivity separates\nthe framing that holds the panes.\n\nShutters\nTests have shown that the exterior\nshutters of Tech House windows can\ncut heat loss through windows on cold\nwinter nights by about 65 percent. The\nshutters can also be rolled down to\nblock direct sunlight during the summer. They can be slightly opened or\n\nadjusted to admit light and air.\nThe shutters have a number of other\nadvantages. As they cannot be opened\nfrom the outside, they contribute to\nhouse security. They can protect\nwindows from flying debris whipped\nup by violent storms. They can reduce\nthe volume of outside noise heard\ninside. The shutters can be raised or\nlowered in seconds by a hand crank\nor electric motor.\n\nDoors and Entry\nVestibules\nEntry vestibules at the front and rear of\nTech house act as airlocks to reduce\nloss of large quantities of warm or cool\nair when people enter or leave the\nhouse. The exterior doors have hotdipped galvanized steel surfaces for\nresistance to rust and corrosion and\nare guaranteed never to warp. Polyurethane foam between the inside and\noutside metal facings prevents\nconducting of heat or cold.\nMagnetic weatherstripping further\nreduces heat loss. When the door is\nclosed, an adjustable sill on the door\nbottom automatically lowers to cut off\nair flow beneath the door. Heat loss\nthrough the Tech house door is about\n65 percent less than it would be\nthrough a conventional wooden door.\n\nAttic Louvers\nHeat developing in attic space can\nreach 160\xc2\xb0F when summer temperatures are 100\xc2\xb0F, adding to the cost of\nair conditioning. Large ventilation\nlouvers in the attic of Tech House keep\nattic temperatures near outside temperatures. Unlike attic fans, louvers\nburn no electricity.\n\nInsulation\nUrea-tripolymer foam insulates the\nTech House ceiling, exterior walls, and\nselected interior walls. Approximately\n71/2 inches of the foam were used in\nthe ceiling; 51/2 inches, in exterior\nwalls. (Usually, 6 inches of fiberglass\nare used in ceilings, 31/2 inches, in\nexterior walls.) Tech House ceiling\nheat loss appears to be about 30\npercent and wall heat loss about 45\npercent less than it would be with\nconventional fiberglass insulation.\nTripolymer is also nonflammable,\nforming a charred crust when exposed\nto flame and extinguishing itself as\nsoon as the flame is removed. Flames\ncannot advance on tripolymer beyond\nthe point of ignition. Tripolymer is also\nnontoxic, odor-free, and rodentresistant.\nTripolymer is cold-setting and nonexpanding and does not settle or lose\nits insulating ability. It fills every crack\nand cranny, blocking noise as well as\nheat and cold. It flows around pipes,\n\nwires, and other obstructions. It can be\napplied through openings as small as\n11/a inches in diameter, making it suitable for insulating existing buildings.\n\nSkylight\nA skylight over the hallway serves a\nnumber of useful functions. It reduces\nthe need for artificial lighting. Sunlight\nstreaming through the skylight on cold\ndays helps heat the hallway. The skylight can be opened to allow heated\nair to escape on warm fall or spring\ndays. To block heating from direct\nsunlight on hot summer days, a\nreflective plastic sheeting is stretched\nacross the bottom of the skylight.\n\n\'IMPORTANT\n\nM\n\n1\n\nEnergy-Saving\nAppliances\nAnother contribution to energy conservation is made through a microwave\noven that reduces cooking time and\nadds little heat to the house (a particular advantage during the summer)\nand by a heat pipe which speeds up\nthe cooking of roasts in a conventional\noven. The heat pipe uses the capillary\naction of a liquid in a sealed pipe to\ntransfer heat. Inserted into the middle\nof the roast to heat the inside as well\nas the outside simultaneously, it can\ncut cooking time in half.\n\n\xe2\x80\xa2\xe2\x80\xa2\n\nWater Conservation\nWater from the Tech House bathtub,\nwashing machine, and shower is\ncollected in a tank, chlorinated and\nfiltered, and used to supply the toilet\ntanks. This water recycling together\nwith smaller (low profile) toilet tanks\nand water-saving shower heads\nreduces water consumption to half of\nwhat it normally would be. It also trims\nthe sewage load, an advantage for\nareas plagued by overloaded sewer\nsystems or septic fields.\n\nSecurity Against\nIntruders\nAn alarm system and other devices\nare designed to protect Tech House\nagainst burglars and other criminals.\nThe house has an alarm system that is\nactivated by punching a code into a\nwall-mounted digital control panel.\nAlarm wires are woven into window\nscreens. Cutting or removing the\nscreens sets off a loud alarm. Pressure\nsensitive pads are emplaced in the\nhallway near the outside doors. A\nperson stepping on one sets off the\n\nWater reuse system.\n\ni;\n\nalarm. A built-in delay gives the\nSWITCH,\noccupant entering the house time to\nGAIN CONTROL\noverride the alarm.\nSelf-locking hinges fabricated at\nLangley are used on the outward\nopening exterior doors. The hinge was\ndeveloped at John F. Kennedy Space\nCenter to secure cabinets and doors\nwith exposed hinge pins. Doors with\nself-locking hinges cannot be opened\nSEISMIC\neven if the hinge pins are removed.\nDETECTOR\nAn exterior security system is designed to alert the occupants to\npotential intruders near the house. It\ncan detect footsteps on the lawn, for\nexample, and by the signals it generates indicate the movement of the\nintruder\xe2\x80\x94whether slow or fast, walking\nor running.\nThe system employs a seismic detector like that used to detect quakes,\nmeteoroid impacts, or volcanic activity\nTELESCOPIC\non the Moon or Mars. The detector\nANTENNA\ngenerates a microwave radio signal\nthat is reflected into the house by an\nIntruder detection system\n\nBATTERY\nCAP\nWEB BELT\nCLIP\n\nantenna under the eaves of the house.\nThe signal can be picked up by a\nconventional FM radio in the house\ntuned to certain frequencies.\nMuggers and robbers sometimes lurk\nin the nighttime shadows of houses,\nintending an ugly surprise for returning\noccupants. The Tech House occupant\ncan use a pocket transmitter about the\nsize of a fountain pen to send out an\nultrasonic signal that turns on the\nporch light. The transmitter, called\nScan, can work from a distance of 30\nfeet.\nThe 1977 power failure in New York\nCity indicated the potential for crime\nthat such blackouts possess. In case of\npower failure, three emergency lights\n(Satellights in Tech House) automatically turn on. They are more than\nadequate for security, providing even\nenough light to read by. The lights\nutilize low voltage, high frequency\npower generated by solid state electronic lamp drives and a 12-volt\nautomobile battery. The battery is\nrecharged by a solar cell on the\ngarage roof. Solar cells, which convert\nlight into electricity, power most United\nStates spacecraft. The Satellight was\ndeveloped originally to illuminate\nspacecraft such as the Skylab experimental manned space station.\nIn addition to helping to provide\npeace of mind, use of security devices\nsuch as described above can contribute to lowering the premiums for\nhomeowners\' insurance policies.\n\nEmergency light shown installed, top photo.\nPressure alarm goes under carpet at\ndoorway, bottom photo\n\nV\xc2\xbb" MINIMUM\nPROTRUDING\n\nSelf-locking hinge\n\nOPEN\n\nCLOSED\n\nSmoke Detection\nA smoke detector in the hallway can\nsense combustion products long\nbefore they are noticeable to people.\nIt sounds a horn loud enough to\nawaken the soundest sleeper. Retail\nstores carry numerous brands of\nsmoke detectors. Characteristics and\nfeatures of the detectors should be\ncarefully studied by the homeowner to\nmake certain that the purchase meets\nhis or her needs.\n\nPrefab Floor and Wall\nTech House builders used several\nprefabricated items basically, not for\neconomy but to provide a basis for\ntechnical evaluation of the performance of such commercially available\nunits. Because a crane is generally\nemployed, use of the prefabricated\ncomponents can cost more than conventional techniques. The economies\ninherent in some forms of prefabrication are best realized when several\nprefab houses are built in the same\ngeneral area at about the same time.\nThe Tech House precast floor is\nmade of concrete reinforced with\nwelded wire fabric and insulated with\ngypsum foam. The precast wall,\nlocated between the master bedroom\nand bathrooms, is made of a steel\nframe supporting glass-fiber reinforced\ngypsum. The gypsum foam insulation\nfills all voids, reducing heat loss or\ngain and noise transmission. It is\nnoncombustible.\n\nSolar cell atop garage recharges battery\nthat powers emergency lights.\n\n15\n\nFlat Conductor Cable\n\nFloor Coverings\n\nTemper Foam\n\nFlat conductor cable has been used\nextensively in airplanes and spacecraft.\nIt is easier to install and modify and\nuses less conductor metal (copper)\nthan conventional round wires. It offers\na way to reduce the high cost of\nelectrical wiring. U.L. approval was\npending and limited use for commercial buildings was being considered\nby the National Electrical Code Committee as this booklet was written.\n\nVarious coverings are used for the\nconcrete cast floor. Of particular interest is the thick foam-backed vinyl\nwith a urethane coating that covers the\nkitchen. The foam backing provides\nsoftness that makes it less tiring to\nwalk or stand on. The naturally shiny\nurethane coating needs minimum care.\nOther floor coverings were: bathroom, ceramic tile; entrance and foyer,\nslate; and bedroom, hallway, and\nliving and dining areas, carpet.\n\nTemper Foam was used to cushion a\nbench by the fireplace. Developed\noriginally to pad seats in the Apollo\nspacecraft, Temper Foam can provide\ncomfortable seating for everyone. It\ncontours to one\'s shape and distributes weight evenly over the contact\nsurface. It also transpires moisture\naway from the body for cooler seating\ncomfort. Among other things, it has\nbeen found effective in preventing bedsores in bedfast patients.\n\nROUND WIRE\nENTRANCE CABLE\nRECEPTACLE\n\nFCC\n\nWALL CLIP\nCIRCUIT BREAKER PANEL\nWITH FCC FEEDER CIRCUITS-\n\nBASEBOARD INSIDE\nCORNER MOLD\nBASEBOARD MOLD\n\nSTACKED FCC\n(MANY CIRCUITS)\n\nSnap-on cover baseboard system\n\nCircuit breaker panel\n\nFCC-\n\nRECEPTACLE\n\nRECEPTACLE BASE\n\nBASEBOARD\nOUTSIDE\nCORNER MOLD\n\nRECEPTACLE\nBASE\n\nWALL CLIP\nFCC\n\nRECEPTACLE\nSTRIPPED\nCONDUCTOR AREA\nCRIMP OR\nSOLDER TAB\n\nBASEBOARD\nReceptacle with pressure contacts\n\nReceptacle with crimp or solder tab\n\nFlat conductor cable (FCC) system\n\n16\n\nLight Bulb Saver\nLight bulb savers have been installed\nm lamp sockets throughout Tech\nHouse.
