Such a capability requires systems, a supporting infrastructure, and funding to become a viable component of this nation's economic strength. This paper follows the development of the COMmercial Experiment Program (COMET) from inception to its current position as the country's first space program dedicated to satisfying the needs of industry: an industry which must investigate the feasibility of space based processes, materials, and prototypes. With proposals now being evaluated, much of the COMET story is yet to be written, however concepts and events which led to it's current status and the plans for implementation may be presented.", "title": "Development of the COMmerical Experiment Transporter (COMET)", "stiType": "OTHER", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "submittedDate": "2013-08-17T13:44:00.0000000+00:00", "isLessonsLearned": false, "authorAffiliations": [{"sequence": 0, "submissionId": 19960011786, "meta": {"author": {"name": "Pawlick, Joseph F., Jr."}, "organization": {"name": "Center for Advanced Space Propulsion", "location": "Tullahoma, TN, United States"}}, "id": "dbc7c27bc2e34713891084691012422b"}], "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "stiTypeDetails": "Other", "technicalReviewType": "TECHNICAL_REVIEW_TYPE_NONE", "modified": "2013-04-09T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "id": 19960011786, "publications": [{"submissionId": 19960011786, "id": "a2ba7301f3594ffc83951931e42370c6", "publicationName": "Center for Advanced Space Propulsion Second Annual Technical Symposium Proceedings", "publicationDate": "1990-11-02T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [{"disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "id": 19960011783, "type": "ANALYTIC_PRIMARY", "title": "Center for Advanced Space Propulsion Second Annual Technical Symposium Proceedings", "stiType": "CONFERENCE_PROCEEDINGS", "distribution": "PUBLIC", "status": "CURATED"}], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "19960011786.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/19960011786/downloads/19960011786.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/19960011786/downloads/19960011786.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/19960011786/downloads/19960011786.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
