The ATPS is a robotic system being developed at Kennedy Space Center to inspect and rewaterproof thermal protection tiles on the space shuttle orbiter prior to launch. The objective of the redesign was to eliminate backlash and provide adequate pitch and yaw actuator force. The wrist actuators have been successfully redesigned, fabricated, tested, and installed. The redesigned wrist actuators meet or exceed all design requirements. The wrist has been reinstalled on the tile processing robot and will be further evaluated during operational testing of the system.", "title": "Three d.o.f.
