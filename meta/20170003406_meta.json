SLS will begin flying crewed missions with an Orion capsule to the lunar vicinity every year after the first 2 flights starting in the early 2020's. As early as 2021, in addition to delivering an Orion capsule to a cislunar destination, SLS will also deliver ancillary payload, termed \"Co-manifested Payload (CPL)\", with a mass of at least 5.5 mT and volume up to 280 m3 simultaneously to that same destination. Later SLS flights have a goal of delivering as much as 10 mT of CPL to cislunar destinations. In addition to cislunar destinations, SLS flights may deliver non-crewed, science-driven missions with Primary Payload (PPL) to more distant destinations. SLS PPL missions will utilize a unique payload fairing offering payload volume (ranging from 320 m3 to 540 m3) that greatly exceeds the largest existing Expendable Launch Vehicle (ELV) fairing available. The Characteristic Energy (C3) offered by the SLS system will generate opportunities to deliver up to 40 mT to cislunar space, and deliver double PPL mass or de-crease flight time by half for some outer planet destinations when compared to existing capabilities. For example, SLS flights may deliver the Europa Clipper to a Jovian destination in under 3 years by the mid 2020's, compared to the 7+ years cruise time required for current launch capabilities. This presentation will describe ground and flight accommodations, interfaces, resources, and performance planned to be made available to potential CPL and PPL science users of SLS. In addition, this presentation should promote a dialogue between vehicle developers, potential payload users, and funding sources in order to most efficiently evolve required SLS capabilities to meet diverse payload needs as they are identified over the next 35 years and beyond.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "United States", "submissionId": 20170003406, "endDate": "2017-03-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "sponsors": [{"meta": {"organization": {"name": "NASA Headquarters", "location": "Washington, DC, United States"}}, "meetingId": "001d54d00e934eaf921ed9210434ca2f", "id": "de2619b804e94cc89368b8532f9a74ef"}], "name": "Planetary Science Vision (PSV) 2050 Workshop", "location": "Washington, DC", "id": "001d54d00e934eaf921ed9210434ca2f", "startDate": "2017-02-27T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20170003406, "id": "21dcd34c20c24eb4b05d99bf97735fde", "publicationDate": "2017-02-27T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20170003406.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20170003406/downloads/20170003406.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20170003406/downloads/20170003406.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20170003406/downloads/20170003406.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
