A relatively new approach has been the launching of satellites into heterogeneous constellations. Constellations provide the scientists a capability to acquire science data, not only from specific instruments on a single satellite, but also from instruments on other satellites that fly in the same orbit. Initial results from the A-Train (especially following the CALIPSO/CloudSat launch) attest to the tremendous scientific value of constellation flying. This paper provides a history of the constellations (particularly the A-Train) and how the A-Train mission design was driven by science requirements. The A-Train has presented operational challenges which had not previously been encountered. Operations planning had to address not only how the satellites of each constellation operate safely together, but also how the two constellations fly in the same orbits without interfering with each other when commands are uplinked or data are downlinked to their respective ground stations. This paper discusses the benefits of joining an on-orbit constellation. When compared to a single, large satellite, a constellation infrastructure offers more than just the opportunities for coincidental science observations. For example, constellations reduce risks by distributing observing instruments among numerous satellites; in contrast, a failed launch or a system failure in a single satellite would lead to loss of all observations. Constellations allow for more focused, less complex satellites. Constellations distribute the development, testing, and operations costs among various agencies and organizations for example, the Morning and Afternoon Constellations involve several agencies within the U.S. and in other countries. Lastly, this paper addresses the need to plan for the long-term evolution of a constellation. Agencies need to have a replenishment strategy as some satellites age and eventually leave the constellation. This will ensure overlap of observations, thus providing continuous, calibrated science data over a much longer time period. Thoughts on the evolution of the A-Train will also be presented.", "isLessonsLearned": false, "disseminated": "DOCUMENT_AND_METADATA", "meetings": [{"country": "South Africa", "submissionId": 20090017526, "endDate": "2009-07-17T00:00:00.0000000+00:00", "name": "IGARSS 2009, A Train Invited Session", "location": "Cape Town", "id": "69de8e06ace8483a8c705be715c36c32", "startDate": "2009-07-13T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "publications": [{"submissionId": 20090017526, "id": "f383618c5fd64c37a769c396057a9d76", "publicationDate": "2009-01-01T00:00:00.0000000+00:00"}], "status": "CURATED", "related": [], "downloads": [{"draft": false, "mimetype": "application/pdf", "name": "20090017526.pdf", "type": "STI", "links": {"original": "/api/citations/20090017526/downloads/20090017526.pdf", "pdf": "/api/citations/20090017526/downloads/20090017526.pdf", "fulltext": "/api/citations/20090017526/downloads/20090017526.txt"}}], "downloadsAvailable": true, "index": "submissions-2022-09-30-06-07"}
