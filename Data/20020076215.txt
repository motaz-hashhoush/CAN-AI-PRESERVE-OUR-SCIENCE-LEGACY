MicroMass also provides\nIntelliPrint, a product designed to create tailored,\nindividualized messages via printed media.\n\nan elite group," says Mark Rinehart, MicroMass\'\ndirector of systems engineering.\nIntelliWeb delivers personalized messages by\ndynamically creating single web pages or entire web sites\nbased on information provided by each website visitor.\nA key feature of the product is that a user need not wade\nthrough volumes to get to sentences. IntelliWeb\ndevelopers tie content databases to expert system-based\nrules/facts databases. These are activated when a visitor\'s\ninformation is either entered via a standard HTML form\nor provided from a customer database. Also, the\ndatabases are triggered when the user3sown personal\nIntelliWeb profile is supplied.\nIntelliPrint uses proprietary technology to generate\nprinted messages that are personally relevant and\ntailored to meet each individual\'s needs. Over\ntime, IntelliPrint establishes a dialogue with\neach customer using individual customer\nfeedback. This information is then utilized to\ncreate timely, relevant and enduring personalized messages.\n"IntelliPrint dramatically changes the\nway ~eople\nhave traditionally communicated," says David Bulger, MicroMass\nchairman and CEO. Historically, people have\nonly been able to communicate on either a\nmicro (one-to-one) or mass (one-to-many)\nlevel, he explains.\nExamples of IntelliPrint in operation are\nnumerous. For instance, Bristol-Myers\nSquibb, in conjunction with MicroMass,\ndeveloped a personalized newsletter, Living at\nYour Best. The newsletter content was geared\nto each recipient based on a health and\nlifestyle survey taken earlier.\nIntelliPrint also is the core technology behind\nSmithKline Beecham\'s Nicorette Committed QuittersSM\nProgram. This 12-week program was built by\nMicroMass using IntelliPrint software, coupled to the\nlatest in demand printing technology. Participants are\nprovided individually customized motivational materials\nto support their attempt to stop smoking.\n"Our system combines the intimacy of very\npersonal, micro communication with the reach of mass\ncommunication, enabling our clients to develop and\nsustain interactive conversationswith millions of\npeople," Bulger says.\n/d\n\nBased on a NASA software ystem,\nInteUiWeb allows user3 topersona& their\n\nAt the heart of these MicroMass personalization\ntechnologies is CLIPS. Computer technicians at\nJohnson Space Center produced CLIPS, a development\nand delivery expert system tool. CLIPS stands for C\nLanguage Integrated Production System,. It provides a\ncohesive software tool for handling a wide variety of\nknowledge with support for three different programming paradigms: rule-based, object-oriented, and\nprocedural. CLIPS was made available to MicroMass\nCommunications through the Computer Software\nManagement and Information Center (COSMICB)in\nAthens, Georgia.\n"By embracing CLIPS and its expert system\ntechnology, our personalization products can make\n\'expert\' content selections.
